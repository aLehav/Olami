WEEHAWKEN, N.J.  — A dance troupe 
from Florida caused a rush-hour terror scare 
when they ditched their cars in the Lincoln Tunnel and tried to run to a TV appearance in Manhattan while wearing their camouflage costumes.
The dancers drove about 1,000 miles so 
they could appear Wednesday on BET’s live “106 & Park” show. But they hit traffic at the tunnel, which connects New Jersey and New York City and is two miles from the studio.The five young women and three young 
men decided to sprint the rest of the way . They left their adult chaperones behind and ran through the toll plaza.
Armed officers with Port Authority police 
and the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force gave chase, closing the tunnel for 45 minutes.
They eventually offered to escort the danc-
ers to the show, but the producers told them it was too late.

It didn’t take long for Lex 
and Terry to find a new home in 
Gainesville.
Local rock station 100.5 The 
Buzz will take over as host for the syndicated rock show. The news comes less than one month after it was dropped from its old home at 
103.7 following the station’s change 
from a rock to country format. 
“Picking up the show is a game 
changer for 100.5 The Buzz,” said 
Russ Allen, a programming di-rector for Sunshine Broadcasting, which owns the rock station. “I’m 
really excited that the 
deal was worked out and we’re going to 
be able to carry that 
show.”
Familiarity to local listeners was one of the primary reasons Al-
len said the station chose to pick up the program, and he said it will be run in its entire five-hour form.
During the hours Lex and Terry 
ran on Rock 104 during the spring of 2010, the station attracted listen-ers in the 18-49 male demographic, 
with 17.9 percent tuning in, Allen 
said. He added that the next high-est-rated station had less than 10 percent of those listeners.
“The moment Rock 104 decided 
to commit suicide and become a country station and Lex and Terry became available, we immediately 
began talking with the syndicator,” 
he said.
The station aims to have the 
program on the air by Monday. Ousted radio personalities find new home
COMMUNITY OUTREACH

Just hours into a three-day hunger strike, 
Pat Fitzpatrick joked that he wished someone 
would sneak him a pepperoni pizza.
But he said he’s chosen to go without food 
to show that hundreds of people are denied 
food every day in Gainesville.
Fitzpatrick began a three-day , one-man 
hunger strike on the steps of City Hall on Monday to protest the 130-meal limit the 
City Commission placed on Gainesville soup kitchens, including the St. Francis House Inc., a kitchen and shelter.
“We’re not the type of town and we’re not 
the type of country that will let people go hun-gry,” he said.
Fitzpatrick had a button on his flower-
covered shirt that said, “Feed Every One!” and sat near 13 signs that could be seen from City Hall’s front door. The signs stated biblical verses and said “The world is watching.” One 
sign had “131” written in big black letters, a 
reminder of the cut-off limit.
He said at times more than 300 people 
show up at the St. Francis House to eat, but only 130 can be fed. 
Fitzpatrick said not many people know 
what it’s like to be hungry — not just missing one meal, not a tiny growl of the stomach, but starving. He’ll break his fast on Thanksgiving, 
one of the three days of the year the meal limit 
is lifted. The other two days are Christmas and a day the kitchens choose.

afternoon and could not be reached for com-ment.Homeless advocate holds protest fast at city hall

A UF linguistics professor wants 
to speak for his community — so 
he’s running for City Commission.
Jimmy Harnsberger, 40, is run-
ning for the District 3 seat in a 
non-partisan race in the March 15 election. District 3 represents the southwest part of Gainesville.
As a commissioner, he said he 
would focus on keeping Gaines-ville’s water and air clean for every-
one. 
He said the commission has the 
power to influence the quality of 
life for Gainesville citizens.
“This is my home,” he said. “The 
decisions the City Commission makes affect our future.”
He said some of his top priorities 
would be asking the Environmental 
Protection Agency for assistance in cleaning up the contaminated wa-ter supply caused by the Cabot-Ko-
ppers Superfund site, keeping cell phone towers out of public parks and balancing the city budget with-out adding extra fees, such as the recent fire assessment fee.
He has been involved with his 
neighborhood organization, Uni-
versity Park 
Neighborhood 
Association, for five years, during whichhe said he helped clean up a 
drug house, pre-vent a two-story adult entertain-ment store from 
being built near UF and helped find a location where a homeless shelter could be built, which resolved a de-bate between advocates and the city government.
He said he will be on campus 
in December and January to speak with student groups.Professor wants spot

SAN JOSE, Calif. — About 
a thousand rats are awaiting 
adoption in California after be-
ing rescued from a house fea-
tured on the A&E reality TV show “Hoarders.”
The Humane Society trucked 
the rodents over the weekend from Los Angeles to San Jose, where more than 30 volunteers and nonprofit staff helped move the rats into Andy’s Pet Shop in 
San Jose, which agreed to tem-
porarily house them.
Lauren Paul of the nonprofit 
North Star Rescue told the San 
Jose Mercury News that the 
previous owner’s daughter had brought home a pregnant rat one day and the litter began multiplying quickly.
The man’s neighbors called 
“Hoarders” producers after the rats began tearing apart the house.
Paul says she hopes rat lov-
ers will come forward and give them a new home.

Video shows police punch-

COCONUT GROVE — Two 
officers have been reassigned 
after a video was posted on 
YouTube that appears to show 
one officer punching a person on the ground on Halloween night.
The Miami Herald reported 
last week that the officers are under internal investigation. Police declined to release any further information or com-
ment.
The video shows what ap-
pears to be an officer repeatedly 
hitting a man on the ground. 
Several other officers were de-
taining other people also on the ground and trying to keep the yelling crowd under control.
Jorge Parraga’s attorney, Vic-
tor Rocha, says his client was merely watching a melee when police grabbed him, threw him to the ground and punched him. 
Parraga was charged with re-
sisting arrest without violence. Rocha plans to file a complaint.

HICKORY, N.C. — A North 
Carolina woman accused of 
appearing in a gross video at 
a Domino’s Pizza kitchen that 
was posted on the Internet last year has pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the 
video.
The Hickory Daily Record 
reports that 32-year-old Kristy 
Hammonds received a sus-pended sentence Friday and 
also was placed on probation 
for 18 months. During that time, she cannot work at any business that prepares or serves 
food or beverages.
In the video, a giggling Ham-
monds narrates as 32-year-old 
Michael Anthony Setzer sticks cheese in his nose and waves 
salami under his rear end while 
making a sandwich. Both had been charged with breaking food sanitation laws.
Hammonds was told to turn 
over recordings of the incident to Domino’s Pizza and not to discuss the case with anyone.

When a drought in Alachua 
County drained Newnans Lake 
down to a moist bed of mud, lo-
cal high school students stumbled upon canoes that hadn’t seen the light of day in several millennia. 
Ten years later, the world’s larg-
est ancient watercraft discovery is now on display at the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History. 
“We dug around with our fin-
gers in the sand for these wet chunks of wood, and we kept find-ing more and more canoes,” said Eastside High School teacher Steve Everett, who led his students to the 
site that morning in 2000. “It was 
pure happenstance that we found them. I’d never seen anything like this.”
Eight miles east of Gainesville, 
archaeologists excavated 101 dug-out canoes from the lake, ranging from 500 to 5,000 years old. The ca-noes varied in size, some as long as 
31.2 feet and some a bit shorter.
After several years developing 
the exhibit, the museum is the first 
to feature archaeologists’ findings before the exhibit travels across the nation.
“We decided to broaden the sto-
ry of the canoes at Newnans Lake into this exhibit because we want-ed it to travel nationally,” said Dar -
cie MacMahon, head of exhibits at 
the museum. “It’s an internation-
ally significant and internationally unique find that our very own sci-entists worked on, and people in the community were really excited 
and proud about that.”
The exhibit also explores the 
history of canoe construction, its 
modern uses and the particularly 
complex process scientists used to 
study their findings. 
Florida Archaeology Collec-
tion Manager Donna Ruhl said the largest canoe discovery before 
then had only consisted of 12 ca-
noes. She said this time researchers could not move the fragile wood and resorted to carving small shav-
ings from the canoes.
“We only had a short amount of 
time until the waters returned af-
ter the drought,” Ruhl said, “so we needed to work quickly and get as 
much information as we possibly 
could.”

A group of UF students gave women in 
the community the keys to the workforce 
through workshops and seminars Mon-
day.
Students in Free Enterprise hosted the 
Women’s Career Expo in hopes of creating an atmosphere for women to gain access 
to local resources. Twelve people attended 
the event, which was held at the Santa Fe Center for Innovation and Economic De-velopment from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.Sarah Hudson, one of the project man-
agers for the expo, said local women can often be disconnected from the opportuni-
ties around them. She said the group is try-
ing to help women succeed and find jobs.
Hudson said this program is helpful be-
cause not many people have the abundant career resources students do. She said the community and the group’s partners have 
embraced the project since it was founded 
three years ago. 
“We are trying to highlight women’s 
strengths they may not realize they have,” she said. FloridaWorks, The Displaced Home-
maker Program: Focus on the Future, TempForce, City College, Navigate Your 
Life, Wells Fargo and Gainesville Area 
Women’s Network had booths. 
There were also résumé workshops and 
mock interviews organized by the War -rington Diplomats, an organization in UF’s Warrington College of Business Adminis-tration.
Mallory Hodas, one of the project man-
agers for the expo, said she hopes to pass along the skills she learned and help pass them along to locals like her mother. Her mother stayed at home while she and her siblings were growing up. She said her 
mother is looking for a job now that her 
kids are getting older. 
“Even if we help 10 people or 100 peo-
ple, it doesn’t matter the number, it mat-ters how we impact them,” she said.Local women learn about workforce through UF project

Students sat in a dark room 
watching a video of two women 
kissing Monday night.
The video was an introduction 
to “The Great Divide: Escaping 
the Stereotype,” an event hosted 
by the Black Student Union in the Rion Ballroom at 7 p.m.
Following the video, about 60 
students traveled between three 
stations to hear student organi-
zations discuss their own stereo-types.
At the first station, representa-
tives from Islam on Campus dis-cussed the misconceptions peo-ple have about their traditional clothes. 
The UF Panhellenic Council, 
National Pan-Hellenic Council and Interfraternity Council rep-resentatives led a discussion at the second station that focused 
on the myths of Greek life.
The Jamaican-American Stu-
dent Association had an open 
discussion at the third station, where representatives of the 
group asked students to tell them 
Jamaican stereotypes.
“I used to always associate 
dreads with Jamaicans,” said 
telecommunication freshman 
Shanice Richardson.
The event ended with a game 
led by students in a leadership and development class. 
The game consisted of read-
ing a statement aloud relating to ethnicity, race and social stigmas, and whenever students related to 
a statement they would stand.
Every student in the room 
stood when asked if he or she 
knew a gay, lesbian or bisexual person. 
Students were then asked to 
stand if they considered them-selves an ally to those people. Only half the students stood back 
up. 
“It was very shocking,” said 
Brittney Williams, an education 
freshman. “It’s like people know about it and don’t support it. Ob-
viously America still has to come 
together.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2010

The marketing and alumni affairs coordinator for the UF 
College of Fine Arts has been crowned mayor seven times.  
Andy Howard became a virtual mayor after being the 
person to “check in” the most at seven venues using the 
Foursquare mobile application.
Foursquare, which launched in March 2009, allows users 
to “check in” via phone to every place they visit and also lets friends see where they are and where they have been. 
As of October, Foursquare has had over four million us-
ers worldwide. According to the website, thousands of busi-
nesses are using the application as a means to promote spe-
cial offers. 
Howard, who is the mayor of Alter Ego Fitness, a gym 
located downtown, has been offered a free 10-minute mas-sage as a reward.
As a marketing coordinator, Howard is always looking 
for new ways to market, which is why he became a member of Foursquare.   
The owner and manager of Alter Ego, Kyle Gold, plans to 
reward up-and-coming mayors with a free protein shake as 
well. So far the gym has had two different mayors. 
Gold thinks there aren’t too many ways to track the fi-
nancial success the gym has gained from being a member of Foursquare, but he thinks it is a good way to build a relation-
ship with customers.
Another business that uses Foursquare, Rolls ‘n Bowls, 
located at 3117 SW 34th St., allows its mayor to skip the line 
and place an order with the hostess, said Emil Taveras, the 
assistant manager.
He said the restaurant joined Foursquare about six 
months ago, and at first only had four initial check-ins. To-day, the restaurant has about 310 check-ins. 
Their current promotion also allows Rolls ‘n Bowls cus-
tomers to get a free order of edamame for every third check-in, Taveras said. 
Guests must present their phone to the hostess to prove 
that the application has “unlocked” the reward.     
 Although the restaurant is mainly using Foursquare as a 
means to reward frequent customers, it has had many new-comers, Taveras said.
Joe’s Place, 5109 NW 39th Ave., is also using Foursquare 
to promote their restaurant, said Elli Alba, assistant man-ager. She believes social media is an exceptional tool for ad-vertising. 
Although the restaurant has not had an increase of visits 
or sales due to its membership with Foursquare, the mayor does come in every Tuesday and claims 10 percent off his entire bill, Alba said.
Fred Posner, manager of Dream Day Cakes said the bak-
ery joined Foursquare about three weeks ago and is offering a free cupcake on every fifth check-in.
 “It’s for fun,” he said. “People like it.”Local businesses offer freebies to Foursquare ‘mayors’� GAINESVILLE REGIONAL AIRPORT 
DOES NOT HAVE BODY SCANNERS.
By BRITT PERKINS

Following the recent implementation of 
invasive pat-down procedures and body 
scanners by the Transportation Security Ad-ministration, many travelers and airline em-ployees are voicing their opposition. 
New pat-down procedures were an-
nounced on the TSA website Oct. 28. They warned passengers to “expect an unpredict-
able mix of security layers.”
Most travelers, however, can avoid pat 
downs by submitting to traditional screen-
ing machines and the advanced imaging technology, which is being used at 68 air -
ports including Jacksonville, Miami, Orlan-do and Tampa International Airports.These new screening systems allow TSA 
officials in a separate room to view a face-less image of a detailed outline of a person’s 
body through his or her clothing.
But Director of Communications for the 
American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, 
Brandon Hensler, said the advanced imag-ing technology is “a virtual strip search and represents an example of how our govern-ment, when confronted with a serious issue, throws money at technology to solve the is-sue.”
“The whole idea of someone seeing an 
anonymous outline of my body is a little un-nerving to me,” said Katherine Martin, 21, a communications science major at UF who will be flying out of Orlando on Tuesday. 
“Out of two choices, I would pick the im-
aging, although I do feel that it is invasive,” she said. “I don’t feel there’s much that I can do other than go with the lesser of the two 
evils.”As government employees, TSA agents 
have a duty to preserve the fundamental 
right to privacy upheld by the Supreme 
Court, said Craig Cox, president of the Gator 
Law American Civil Liberties Union.
“Air travel is an integral part of American 
society, and I’m not sure this is such a com-pelling governmental interest as to overcome our right to privacy,” he said in an e-mail.
Despite this, a majority 
of travelers have cooperated with the new procedures, 
said TSA representative Sari 
Koshetz in an e-mail.
“A very small number of people opt out 
and get pat downs,” Koshetz said. “[There 
is a] very minimal number of complaints across the country as 98 percent of the peo-ple who are asked to go through [advanced imaging technology] do so.”
UF journalism student Ashley Podoll 
plans to spend her Thanksgiving holiday in her hometown of Denver, Colo., which would mean a 28-hour drive if she chose not to fly. But she said she understands the 
TSA’s position.
“I’d rather more security cautions than 
less, even if it does mean images,” said 
Podoll, who will fly out of Orlando on Tues-day.
The Gainesville Regional Airport, unlike 
the international airports, does not have ad-vanced imaging technology and has not seen changes in business or delays as a result of 
security measures, said Laura Aguiar, public 
relations and government affairs manager for the airport.
“Keeping in mind that it’s the busy travel 
season and flights are fuller than usual be-cause the economy is rebounding, people, as usual, should pack their patience,” she said.
Because it is a small airport, Aguiar said 
people can arrive an hour before their de-
parture and make it to their flights on time.

� OPERATION CATNIP GIVES 
FREE SPAY, NEUTER AND VACCINE SERVICES.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Writer
Somewhere in Gainesville, Jenni-
fer Kramel knows there is a cat that 
needs her help. 
Kramel arrives at Pointe 23 
Apartments in her white Volvo sta-
tion wagon, searching for a calico 
cat. She read about it in a Craigslist ad posted by a woman here.
Her headlights shine across a 
dumpster as she pulls into the park-ing lot, lighting cat eyes.
A 39-year-old mom and part-
time student at Santa Fe College, she has been trapping cats for more than 
three years. She catches them for 
Operation Catnip, a nonprofit orga-nization that neuters and vaccinates feral cats in Gainesville, then releas-es them where they were found. 
Kramel parks and walks toward 
it. She squats and reaches out her hand. The cat hisses, baring teeth, but allows her to pet him. Fingers brush dirty orange fur.
She glances at his left ear. It’s 
clipped — a sign that he’s already neutered.
She gives him food, and as he 
dips toward the mushy treat she puts the trap holding the calico, which took the bait, in her car. Look-ing at the orange cat, she sighs and gets into her station wagon. 
A key twists, a gear shifts and she 
pulls out of the parking spot. As she passes the cat she slows, staring.
“Oh my God,” she says, leaning 
against the steering wheel. “I feel terrible for this cat.” She covers her mouth.“That cat shouldn’t have to live that way . It’s not fair.” 
She hits the gas and moves on.
Feral cats are everywhere. They 
live on street corners, in parking lots 
and by dumpsters. Some find care-takers, but most live alone or in colo-nies, scrounging for food. 
Formed in Raleigh, N.C., in 1997, 
Operation Catnip expanded to Gainesville in 1998. This nonprofit program provides free spay , neuter 
and vaccine treatment for feral cats.
The program helps keep feral cat 
populations from skyrocketing, said founder Dr. Julie Levy . 
The program holds one clinic a 
month and usually treats more than 
200 cats each time. 
These are 200 cats that won’t have 
litters of homeless kittens. These are 200 feral cats that won’t be at risk for rabies, distemper, feline leukemia or feline upper respiratory infections.
But without people like Kramel 
to bring cats to the clinic, many might never receive help. 
Kramel grew up with pet cats, 
and feels like it’s her duty to help. 
Some nights, she might trap as 
few as two cats or as many as 19.
But even when she helps 20 cats, 
there are always a few she finds that are beyond her help. Like the orange cat at Pointe 23 Apartments. Already neutered, it seemed there was no hope for him. 
On the drive to the home of Jef-
frey Haviland, who sets out food for feral cats, Kramel can’t shake the 
memory of the cat waiting by the 
dumpster. She’s going to check on the traps she set at Haviland’s home. The one she couldn’t trap sticks in her mind.
She pulls her car next to the curb 
and gets out. Haviland walks over to greet her. Standing by her car, she tells him about other cats she 
trapped that day . She also tells him 
about the one she left behind. 
She pauses, looking at him. Havi-
land seems to notice the cue, but says nothing. 
Kramel smiles and bounces on 
the soles of her feet. She hugs him. 
“It would just be really sad for 
him to die starving in a parking lot.” 
On Sunday morning, Kramel 
drives to the Operation Catnip clinic and unloads the cats, still in their traps after a night in her garage. Each clinic usually has between 90 and 120 trained volunteers, includ-ing veterinarians, UF veterinary stu-dents and locals.
The orange cat is carried past the 
anesthesia line and into the clinic’s main room.  On a table, a volunteer covers an unconscious cat with a blue sheet. She cuts the cloth around its pelvis and the surgery begins.
As that cat is sterilized, the or -
ange one is vaccinated. He receives two shots through the trap’s grat-ing. Afterward, he is carried past the other cat, still lying on the table 
where it will be sewn up and carried 
to another station.
Getting vaccinated takes about 
15 minutes, but the full process takes about an hour. Those who brought cats to the clinic will keep them over -
night and then return them to their original haunts. Few cats have sur -
gery complications, and those that 
do are kept at the clinic overnight. 
The orange cat skips this wait 
and is carried back to Kramel. 
Later that day , Kramel takes the 
orange cat to Haviland’s house. 
They keep him in the trap for a cou-ple hours, then open it. 
Feral cats usually aren’t relocated 
after Operation Catnip. But for Kra-
mel, the orange cat was an exception. 
Dirty, worn and hungry, he seemed to be a wanderer.
Kramel believes he will stay . “He has got it made,” she said. 
“He’s a lucky cat.”

A Facebook post led to an attempted 
gang attack in a southeast Gainesville apartment complex Sunday night.
According to a Gainesville Police re-
port, at about 9 p.m. Sade Ferguson, 21, and eight juveniles went to the apart-ment of a minor with intentions of as-saulting her because she said she didn’t like the Wolf Pack gang on Facebook.
Ferguson and her accomplices are 
members of the gang, and when they arrived at the girl’s apartment, the sus-pects were carrying rocks, 
bricks, sticks and a baseball bat, the re-port stated.
GPD officers were already at the resi-dence investigating a related stalking case when the gang members arrived. They saw the officers and tried to run away , but they were caught and arrested. 
Ferguson refused to speak, but one of 
the juveniles admitted going to the house with the intention of attacking the girl with the bricks and stones.
Ferguson was charged with one fel-
ony count of conspiracy and eight mis-demeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Youth gang attacks over Facebook post

COMMUNITY OUTREACH
By JORDAN PETERS
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
With 500 bags of groceries, 20 student volunteers and 
one football team, coach Urban Meyer and Father David 
J. Ruchinski are trying to supply food and clothing to 
homeless people and needy families in Gainesville.
Gators football players gathered Monday at St. Au-
gustine Church and Catholic Student Center to help pack bags full of groceries and clothes. The players worked for a few hours, assembling about 500 bags, which will be distributed to about 300 families via St. Francis House, Catholic Charities and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. 
“It got to be a little competitive, with who could make 
a bag faster than the other one,” said Debby Cherwak, a campus minister at St. Augustine. 
The event wasn’t just a showcase of the team’s speed. 
With about $12,000 worth of groceries and clothing do-nated, the charity was one of the largest St. Augustine 
Church has ever held, according to Ruchinski, who is pastor of St. Augus-tine. 
Donations came from a wide vari-
ety of sources. Parishioners gave some cash, while Publix and Florida Food 
Service donated food. Pepsi and Nike 
added socks and shirts as part of their partnership with the University Ath-letic Association, and one local citrus 
farmer even contributed oranges.
The largest donation, however, came in the form of a 
cash gift from Meyer himself. Although Ruchinski would not give an exact amount, Meyer’s contribution paid for most of the supplies, according to Cherwak. 
“It was a large, significant donation that reached a lot 
of people,” Ruchinski said.
He said Meyer contacted the church about a month 
ago, wanting to create a local, faith-based outreach pro-gram.
Student volunteers, such as Andy Kline and Scott Gu-
lig, helped set up the event and transport the groceries to the charities to be distributed.
“It was good seeing the players out in the community 
doing something good,” Kline said.Football team

40% YES60% NOMonday’s question: Should the Constitution be amended to fix the lame-duck gap?Today’s question: Should students lose Bright Futures as punishment for cheating?Four Loko banned; freedom may be next
Now that whining politicians and journalists 
have bravely taken a stand against the malt en-ergy phenomenon known as Four Loko, maybe 
they can now turn their sights to another powerful com-bination that can be hazardous to those who imbibe it in too-large doses.
Freedom.
The brainchild of three students at Ohio State Uni-
versity and proudly brewed in Chicago, Four Loko is as 
indisputably American as apple pie made in China from Chilean apples and sold at Walmart.
Similar to how the Champagne region of France is 
known for its signature bubbly brew, the American Mid-west can be proud to have incubated the careful crafting of malt liquor and caffeine that has sparked a national outrage against free choice.
Sold for the past few years with little public fanfare 
in corner stores all across our great cities, Four Loko is now being persecuted by powerful interests after a series of unfortunate events on lily-white college cam-puses. 
Freaking out about Four Loko is the most popular 
thing to do in America at the moment, and banning this beverage is one of the few things that lame-duck legisla-tures nationwide will accomplish this calendar year.
Advertisements celebrating the right to freely imbibe 
alcoholic beverages drive a good portion of our econo-my, and much of the remaining economy is propped up by the construction of new Starbucks locations.
While the free market clearly shows a need for a 
beverage that fuels an alcoholic alertness, Four Loko is evil because a few college-age kids somehow displayed poor judgment and engaged in reckless behavior.The national outcry against 
Four Loko is the best advertising imaginable, but the makers of the 
drink have bowed to the pressure 
and announced the other day that the drink will now be made with no caffeine or stimulants.
There were eight flavors of free-
dom brewed under the Four Loko 
banner up until that fateful announcement, but even the responsible among us get swept up by hysteria when an easy political target presents itself before frightened 
politicians in a lame-duck shooting session.
Left with no other choice but to go on the road to 
chase the elusive mistress known as personal liberty in 
a mad dash for the remaining supply of original blend 
Four Loko, young people across the country will soon 
be embarking on a Grape-flavoreds of Wrath exodus to where freedom remains divine. 
Like a modern-day Tom Joad in boat shoes, maybe 
one enterprising bro can inspire the next great American 
novel based on his ill-fated journey out west chasing 
the dream of opportunity that tastes like Jolly Ranchers made by Satan.
Be forewarned, all you forlorn Four Loko freedom 
riders seeking the intoxicating and invigorating elixir — the federal government has already begun to swing the ax on a full-scale  Four Loko ban nationwide.
But I heard a feller say there’s still some freedom in a 
can left to be had out Californy way. 
Tommy Maple is an international communications 
graduate student. His columns appear Tuesdays.
University of Central Florida business professor Rich-
ard Quinn gave his 615 students an interesting di-lemma this month: Fess up or get out.
After a set of midterm examination questions found its 
way into the hands of a couple hundred Golden Knights, Quinn told the students that those who came forward and admitted to cheating would have to take an ethics course but 
could stay at the school. Those who didn’t come clean and 
were caught would face expulsion. Most came forward.
The latest national story involving academic integrity 
(see: Cam Newton, FSU football team, etc.), with help from a shrewd investigation from the St. Petersburg Times, added 
an interesting element to the problem most college students 
don’t see as a problem at all.
According to the newspaper’s findings, cheating and 
state-funded scholarships aren’t mutually exclusive. To 
keep a Bright Futures scholarship, which more than three-
quarters of UF students have, all a Gator’s got to do is keep a 3.0 for the highest payout and maintain a full-time course load. If a student can maintain a 3.0 while cheating his or her way through college, including being caught for it, he or 
she can still have a very Bright Future, indeed.
The only thing combating academic dishonesty, for 
example, at the University of South Florida is the unique 
grade of “FF” that students receive as a failing grade for 
cheating. But students can receive three “FF” grades before 
they’re kicked out for good.
At UCF, which started giving a grade of “Z” this semes-
ter for cheating students, saw 290 reported instances of aca-demic dishonesty last year. Only one of those cases, or one-
third of 1 percent, resulted in the student’s expulsion.
Florida State University and our very own UF have no 
grade distinction for academic misconduct. And even UF 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes said failing a course is common, 
but it’s not automatic in cases where students are caught 
cheating.
In 2009 alone, UF dealt with about 350 instances of cheat-
ing.
Cheating has truly become an issue that’s not really an 
issue. And there’s something wrong with that.
There’s something wrong with the 350 instances of re-
ported academic misconduct at UF last year. There’s some-thing wrong with allowing those 350 cases to affect the aca-
demic integrity of the best public university in the state of 
Florida. And there’s something wrong with allowing any-one who is caught violating that integrity to remain at this university.
With the money for Bright Futures quickly running out 
and legislators having to cut funding so that “100 percent coverage” doesn’t really mean 100 percent anymore, some-thing needs to be done to prevent those found guilty for cheating from receiving the state-administered funds need-
ed by others.
UF should value its academic integrity and not only de-
velop a unique grade to distinguish a case of academic dis-
honesty but also develop a policy to lead to the expulsion of those who are found cheating.
To allow academic dishonesty to remain unchecked at 
our university is to deny the success of more honest indi-viduals. And there’s something wrong with that.Honor Code
UF should crack down 
on academic dishonesty

Monday columnists’s
assertions about Congressional lame-duck period are not correct
Columnist Chris Dodson 
makes an inaccurate point 
about Congressional lame 
duck sessions in his Mon-
day column. 
To say it is against the 
will of the people for mem-
bers of Congress to contin-
ue working after they have been voted out of office is 
simply incorrect. 
It is the people exactly 
who chose to elect them to 
their term, and members of Congress have a democratic 
mandate to serve their com-
plete term. 
If defeated Congresspeo-
ple stopped serving imme-
diately after Election Day, it 
would deprive their states 
or districts of representa-
tion in the two intervening months until the next term of Congress begins.

There are approximately 30,000 Muslims in the State 
of Oklahoma. And apparently, the State of Oklaho-ma thinks they’re up to something.
Oklahoma voters recently ratified a state constitutional 
amendment that prohibits judges from considering Sharia law in their decisions. 
The proposal was bolstered by a case in New Jersey 
in which the court considered Sharia law in its decision to deny a Muslim woman a restraining order against her 
sexually abusive ex-husband. 
That decision, thankfully, was overturned on appeal.
But it was enough to drive seven out of ten Oklahoma vot-
ers toward the “Save Our State” Amendment,” to “save” 
Oklahoma from, in the words of the bill’s main author, 
Muslims who desire nothing more than to take away “lib-erties and freedom from our children.”
The Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Is-
lamic Relations is currently challenging the constitution-
ality of this amendment, and rightfully so. But the law 
exemplifies something far more insidious than bad public policy. 
Quite simply, there is a dangerous amount of igno-
rance in the United States about what Sharia law actu-ally is. And until this misconception is corrected, as an-other concerned columnist so eloquently put it, the war 
on global Islamist terror will also continue be a war on 
American Muslims.
Particularly during the Park51 controversy this sum-
mer, a wave of hysteria swept the country over the pros-pect of Sharia law on American soil.
 Following reports that the imam behind the Islamic 
center considered the United States a “Sharia-compliant” country, right-wing commentators labeled the man a “radical” and bashed his ostensible support for “bringing 
Sharia law to America.” 
Park51 protestors ferociously waved signs featuring 
the word “Sharia” in dripping blood-red paint. And dur -
ing her campaign, Sharron Angle infamously referred to 
the possibility of Sharia law in the United States as a “mil-itant terrorist situation.”
Their scorn for Sharia, of course, 
does not emerge from a vacuum. 
Practitioners of Sharia in countries 
like Iran and Afghanistan, the headlines tell us, stone 
adulterous women, cut off thieves’ hands, and physically mutilate wives for running away from their husbands. 
In addition, many on the right look to Britain, where the 
government officially sanctions Sharia courts.
 The main author of the Oklahoma bill referred to the 
British courts as a “cancer” and considers his amendment a “pre-emptive strike” against an ideology that seeks to 
subvert the “Judeo-Christian principles” upon which 
America was founded.
Unfortunately for him, however, Sharia has already 
made it to our shores.
Sharia — meaning “the path” — is far from merely a 
penal system and is far from monolithic. Every single be-havior in a devout Muslim’s life is regulated by the ju-risprudence of the Koran and the Sunna, the Prophetic 
tradition. 
There are at least five major schools of jurisprudence 
and myriad philosophies within each school. So although 
the word “Sharia” may conjure images of floggings and 
female circumcision, for the vast majority of American 
Muslims, life under Sharia is about as oppressive raising a family, doing community service, and abstaining from alcohol.
Furthermore, the framework for sanctioning Islamic 
tribunals in the United States has existed for years. As one legal blogger notes, Sharia courts—such as those in England—fall under the category of “alternative dispute resolution” mechanisms. 
If two parties in a dispute agree to abide by the deci-
sions of a third party, the government must enforce that third party’s decision so long as it does not violate public policy or the law. 
In the United States, resolutions like this can take secu-
lar form in arbitration, religious form in Orthodox Jewish Beit Dins, and entertaining form in popular shows like “Judge Judy.” 
There is nothing frightening about this, and certainly 
nothing “militant.”
So what of the apparent fear that, if given a toehold 
in America, Sharia courts will establish a“parallel legal system” that enshrines honor killings and spousal abuse? 
Twenty years ago, in Employment Division v. Smith, the 
Supreme Court precluded this fear by ruling that absent a compelling state interest, religious law cannot override secular law. 
As Antonin G. Scalia wrote for the majority opinion, it 
would contradict “both constitutional tradition and com-mon sense” to “make an individual’s obligation to obey” the law “contingent upon the law’s coincidence with his religious beliefs.”
To be sure, there is still a compelling question as to 
how voluntary these courts are in some cases. 
Often in Britain, writes one editorialist for The Guard-
ian, Muslim women face tremendous community pres-
sure to accept decisions that are clearly biased against 
them. But the United States can deal with issues of duress individually. 
It should not impact the rights of Muslims who genu-
inely desire to resolve their financial and civil disputes among themselves.
During his recent visit to Indonesia, President Barack  
Obama reiterated that America is not at war with Islam. 
But we must go even further: America is not at war with 
Sharia, either. 
Sharia is the Islamic legal code, a code that Muslims 
have every right to arbitrate under as long as their deci-sions do not violate American law or public policy. It’s 
that simple.
 And frankly, it is absurd to think that fear should pre-
vent the United States from awarding Muslims the same 
rights it awards to Orthodox Jews and contestants on 
“Judge Judy.”

Welcome back to 
the standings, Mr. Robinson. It seems 
like you were the 
Heisman frontrun-ner in a different season, but it 
was only September. Sure, your Wolverines have really tanked, but you ran for another 121 yards Sat-urday. Now you’re the ﬁ  rst player in 
FBS history to rush for more than 
1,500 yards and pass for more than 1,500 yards. Now, if only you 
had half as many wins as you did 
highlight-reel runs.
A bye week, plus a mediocre show-
ing against Cal on Nov. 13, cost 
James a spot on our Heismanstandings. And, with no Pac-10 Championship game looming, 
James will have less games to prove
himself down the stretch. But wins 
this weekend against No. 21 Arizona and Dec. 4 
against Oregon State will put James and No. 1 Oregon in the national championship game — not 
a bad fall back.A win this Saturday against in-state 
rival Oklahoma would put the Cow-
boys in the Big 12 Championship, 
giving Blackmon yet another week to 
terrorize opposing defensive backs 
and fans. If Oklahoma State does 
reach the conference championship, 
and if Blackmon puts up his typical stats, here’s 
what Heisman voters will be looking at: about 113 
catches, 1,872 receiving yards and 20
receiving touchdowns.
Another Friday, another easy WAC win for 
Moore and the Broncos. The junior quar-
terback posted what has become a pe-destrian night: 333 yards, 4 touchdowns, a 51-point win. Boise State has been 
knocked for its seemingly weak schedule, 
but that season-opening win against Vir-
ginia Tech (and Moore’s three-touchdown performance) 
keeps looking better and better. And a potential QB duel with Nevada’s Colin Kaepernick could move Moore in 
position to unseat Newton.
Every writer with a vote is secretly wish-
ing Cam and the Tigers fall this Friday in the Iron Bowl at Alabama. More speciﬁ  -cally, they hope he plays poorly enough to justify skipping his name in favor of a less controversial player at the Heisman ceremony. And if Cam plays well, guides 
the Tigers to the national championship and continues to melt southern women with his ear-to-ear grin, all hell 
will break loose … in about two years.

Sturgis expected to request medical hardship for back injury
football,” he said. “Everybody watched that game, and 
you wouldn’t miss it, a lot like the Florida-Georgia game.”
Even when he was the head coach at either Bowling 
Green or Utah, he made sure not to miss the in-state showdown.
“You just could not miss it if it was on TV, and if 
you had to do something else at the time, like maybe coach another game, you would always watch the score afterward because that was off the charts,” Meyer said. “I just remember the great athletes, and the speed of the game was just second to none.”
Injuries: The Gators continue to be plagued with in-
juries.
Meyer said he expects kicker Caleb Sturgis (back), 
who has not played since Sept. 25 against Kentucky, to 
request a medical hardship.
The UF coach also listed wide receiver Andre Debose 
(ankle), cornerback Jeremy Brown (hamstring) and line-
backer A.J. Jones (hamstring) as probable for Saturday’s matchup with FSU.

Knee injury could force     
Macklin to sit up to one month
season and is expected to go against 
FAU, he has been severely limited in practice the last two weeks by 
a combination of tendinitis, bone 
spurs and chondromalacia, which is when the kneecap grinds against nearby bones due to a cartilage is-
sue. 
Even though Macklin said his 
knee felt fine after Sunday’s win 
against Morehead State, Donovan said the team will consider giv-
ing him a break for two weeks to a 
month if that could reasonably be expected to truly fix the problem. 
To this point, the decision to 
continue to use Macklin has been driven more than anything by a lack of knowledge about the injury, as it is unclear whether rest would 
even help. 
“Because we’ve had so many 
games in such a short period of 
time in practice and everything 
else, we haven’t really had a chance 
to calm it down,” Donovan said. “That’s what I want to find out — what would rest really do for him and how much rest would be suf-ficient enough that you’d say, ‘OK, 
we’re going to see some drastic 
changes.’”
Macklin, Donovan, team train-
ers and team doctors will likely be 
meeting this week to discuss pos-
sible solutions. But Donovan has already all but ruled out an inva-sive procedure.
“He doesn’t need surgery,” 
Donovan said. “If he does do that, there’s no guarantee he’s going to have a massive improvement.”
Donovan said possible replace-
ments would include freshman Patric Young and sophomore Erik Murphy, who got his first career 
start against North Carolina A&T.
One player not currently under 
consideration is freshman Cody 
Larson, who will not enter a game unless it is absolutely necessary, as 
he and Donovan consider the pos-
sibility of a redshirt.HOOPS , from page 14Gators have outrebounded opponents 133 to 110 this season
Apart from ball security, the Gators will 
likely turn their attention inside against 
the Ospreys. 
UNF’s starting five features just one 
player over 6-feet tall — 6-foot-2 center 
Larkira Jones — and the discrepancy in size is something Butler said the Gators will look to exploit.
“They’re a much more face-the-basket 
type of team, even their post players,” But-ler said. 
“Certainly we’ll try to take advantage 
of that with our size and try to establish ourselves in the paint.”UF has consistently outrebounded its 
opponents (133-110), while UNF’s competi-
tion this season holds 
a 147-108 advantage on the boards.
The Ospreys have 
faced a tough early season schedule, traveling to play North Carolina and Cincinnati on the road, and Butler said the scrappy team should not be 
overlooked. 
“They’re a group that really competes,” 
she said. “You can’t underestimate … how hard they’re going to come in here and try 
to battle us and steal a win.”W-HOOPS , from page 14

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI QUOTABLE UF FOOTBALL
� The Vikings finally fired Brad Childress. With no Wade Phillips or Childress 
coverage to rely on, ESPN announced that they will be scaling down to a 24/6 
sports news network. And sources say once Brett Favre is done, ESPN will again cut back and be turned into a once a week one-hour show every Saturday on ABC.  “They’re not a big blitz team. They’re 
not one of those ‘Star Wars’
defenses. They just play sound de -
fense with very good players.”

After being thrown out of Saturday’s 
game, Carl Moore will play against FSU.
On Monday the Southeastern Confer -
ence notified Florida that the senior wide 
receiver will not receive additional punish-ment after fighting with Appalachian State 
defensive back Ed Gainey. The two players 
were ejected from Saturday’s game imme-diately following the incident, which oc-curred in the second quarter.
The Gators had the option of holding 
Moore out of the FSU game, but coach Ur -
ban Meyer decided against it.
“You can barely see it on videotape,” 
Meyer said. “I didn’t see it during the 
game. I had a meeting with him yesterday 
and the rule is you miss half of a game for retaliation. The guy took a shot and he re-taliated.”
But UF’s coach plans to talk with his 
team about the incident.
“We don’t do that,” Meyer said. “I’m go-
ing to re-emphasize that with the team that there is a fighting rule. Our guys have been decent about that. But a lot of things hap-pen during the course of a game. Whether 
you get hit first (or not), you just have to 
walk away from it.”
FSU-UF rivalry: Before Meyer became 
Florida’s coach in 2005, he was already 
interested in the rivalry between UF and 
FSU.

Florida’s frontcourt depth 
was meant to be an insurance 
policy it could wait a year to 
collect. 
With three seniors and 
a sophomore returning to 
the fold, it was thought that 
freshmen like Patric Young, Will Yeguete and Cody Lar -
son would have a season to learn before they were asked 
to do more than give the 
starters a quick breather. 
But now the Gators’ plans 
could be 
changing. 
Coach  
Billy Dono-
van an-n o u n c e d 
M o n d a y 
that tonight’s game between 
No. 16 Florida (3-1) and Florida Atlantic (3-2) at 7 in 
the O’Connell Center could 
potentially be the last se-nior Vernon Macklin plays in before taking an extended break to rest his injured right 
knee.
“He’s full-go in practice 
and to play, but he’s dealing 
with pretty significant pain 
and probably doesn’t have 
the same explosion he nor -
mally would have,” Dono-van said. “He’s certainly physically not himself with 
the way he’s moving and 
running, and he looks like he’s hobbled a little bit.”

UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Inexperience breeds mistakes. It’s inevi-
table. 
Despite two victories in three games this 
season, coach Amanda Butler’s team has 
definitely made its share. 
The Gators (2-1) are averaging more 
than 20 turnovers per game and are com-ing off a last-second defeat against DePaul 
in which they tied a season-high with 24 
giveaways.
Shrinking that number will bode well 
for Florida’s chances of getting back in the win column against North Florida (1-2) to-day at 4:30 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
Before the season there was much talk 
about bringing a faster pace and an aggres-
sive mentality to UF. Cou-ple that with the addition of six new players (four freshmen), and an uptick 
in mistakes was expected. 
However, Butler said 
many of the team’s mis-
cues are occurring during 
half-court sets and not in 
transition. 
“The turnovers, we feel, aren’t coming 
in the up-tempo minutes. So the answer certainly isn’t to slow the ball down,” But-
ler said, citing poor shot selection as one of the culprits for the high numbers. 
“It’s going to be a process for us, we’re 
not going to slow down. We feel like we’re 
at our best when we’re playing fast.”
A 16-3 run to end the first half against 
UCF and an 11-2 run against Charlotte 
shows the potential of pressing the action. 
Helping UF extend its lead both times, the 
fast pace also creates some security from future mistakes.
“We know we’re going to turn the ball 
over some, I think most teams know that,” 
Butler said. “But we’ve got to keep it under 
20 a game, certainly against good teams, to have a chance to win.”UF focuses on limiting turnovers against UNF

LAKELAND — With just min-
utes remaining in his senior season, 
Jeff Driskel took a snap from his own 9-yard line and dropped back to pass. As Lakeland High defend-ers bore down on him, the four-star quarterback rolled out to his left to avoid pressure. Running out of time and room, he shed one defender in the backfield and jetted down the 
left sideline before juking a defensive 
back in the Dreadnaughts’ second-ary . Ninety-one yards later, Driskel accounted for his fifth touchdown of the night, and what would be his last for Oviedo Hagerty High.
In his team’s first playoff appear -
ance in school history , against one of the state’s premiere teams and in 
front of a crowd of more than 5,000 
on the road, Driskel, the No. 1 quar -
terback recruit in the nation, racked up 507 total yards of offense to go with his five-touchdown perfor -
mance.
The right-handed passer went 15 
of 27 for 176 yards and two scores 
through the air while also running 
the ball 20 times for 273 yards and two touchdowns. He added a 58-yard touchdown reception on a trick play in his team’s 56-35 Class 5A playoff loss.
It was a memorable final perfor -
mance for Driskel, a UF oral commit whose 6-foot-3, 225-pound frame and ability to run and throw have drawn comparisons to a former UF quarterback — Tim Tebow. 
But Driskel is used to the hype 
and attention.
“The (Tebow) comparisons have 
been coming and I’ve embraced 
them” he said. “It’s a great compli-
ment to be compared to the greatest college football player ever.”
Handling 
the Hype
According to his father, Jerry 
Driskel, there wasn’t always a spot-
light on his son as a quarterback. In fact, the attention didn’t start until shortly after Jeff’s sophomore year 
of high school.
Driskel was always more of a 
baseball player. Jerry grew up play-
ing baseball, so he taught Jeff to play when he was 5 years old.
His aspirations were originally in 
baseball, which he excelled at, and he is considered one of the top base-ball prospects in the nation.
It wasn’t until just before high 
school that Driskel got into football. He played in a Pop Warner league and really enjoyed it.
Following his sophomore year, 
he started going to various sum-mer camps and combines, including ones sponsored by Under Armour and Nike, as well as two Army All-
American combines in San Antonio.“Local guys knew him when he 
was a freshman,” Jerry said. “But 
nationally, right after his sopho-more year he started going to some combines … and that got him on the 
radar pretty good.”
That’s when the hype began, and 
there was no end in sight for the 
quarterback prospect.
Even though his team finished 
2-8 his junior year, the dual-threat quarterback (whom Rivals.com ranks as the nation’s top pro-style passer) threw for nearly 1,500 yards 
and 11 touchdowns while adding 
five touchdowns on the ground.
The promise he showed at camps 
combined with his performance on the field only added to the attention he received from college coaches, re-cruiters and the media.“Once it starts, it’s a little over -
whelming,” Jerry said.
When the scholarship offers 
began to roll in, Jerry said his son would get at least three phone calls a day from media outlets that wanted to talk to the highly touted passer. And while it was a lot to deal with, Driskel didn’t want to decline inter -
view requests from anybody.
Along with the interviews, people 
would come up to him after games and ask for his autograph. Follow-ing the Lakeland game, a young fan accompanied by his father ap-
proached Driskel with a Gators foot-
ball and asked the star to sign it. 
Driskel, of course, fulfilled the 
fan’s request.
“He knows it comes with the ter -
ritory when you’re a big-time quar -terback and you’re going to college,” Jerry said.
Driskel’s coach, Nate Gierke, 
helped him deal with the pressures 
of being the top-rated passer in the 
nation.
Gierke, who has been around 
high school football his entire ca-reer and was an assistant at Orlando Edgewater High before taking the head coaching position at Hagerty , has dealt with some sought-after recruits during his time in the busi-ness, including current UF lineback-er Lorenzo Edwards.
The Hagerty coach passed along 
ways he’d seen prospects deal with hype in the past, and he said the quarterback exceeded his expecta-
tions.
“The whole season I’ve worked 
hard and stayed humble,” Driskel 
said. “I think that’s the biggest key , 
staying humble.”
The Second 
Coming?
Tebow, who was a part of two 
BCS national title teams and be-
came the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy, cast a long shadow over Florida’s program, a shadow that John Brantley, Jordan Reed and Trey Burton have not been able to overcome.
With Driskel planning to enroll 
at UF in January, and his perfor -
mance against Lakeland being the final image of his high school ca-reer, the expectations surrounding the quarterback will only continue to grow when he steps on cam-
pus. 
“I’m not worried about the 
hype,” Driskel said. “There’s been 
hype for a while now and I think I’ve handled it pretty well.”
Brantley, once thought to be 
the heir to Tebow’s throne, has struggled during his first season as Florida’s starter. He has been the focus of criticism from Gators fans, who have booed the quarter -
back at times this year.
And while Florida’s offense 
has been stagnant, Driskel has flourished for Hagerty, leading 
the Huskies to a 7-4 record and 
the first playoff appearance in the school’s brief history.
Driskel, whose arm is ranked 
as the strongest in the nation by Rivals, has proven his ability to torch defenses while being able to buy time with his feet and often making something out of nothing.
Of his 273 rushing yards 
against Lakeland, most came on plays that weren’t designed runs, including his 91-yard touchdown and a 65-yard scramble in which he shed another defender in the backfield before showing off a burst of speed down the sideline that some would deem unnatural 
for a player of his build.
“The great ones are just born 
with that,” Gierke said. “He’s got 
that innate talent to make things happen, and he’s done that for four years for me.”
Meanwhile, Brantley and Flori-
da’s offense have struggled to step out from Tebow’s shadow, rank-ing 73rd in the nation in total of-fense just one year after finishing sixth in the same category.
Brantley also arrived at UF sur -
rounded by high hopes after being rated the nation’s No. 3 pro-style 
quarterback in 2007, but Driskel’s 
running ability makes him a more natural fit for the scheme Tebow made so successful.
“I didn’t coach Tim Tebow 
in high school, so I don’t know,” 
Gierke said of the comparisons to 
Tebow. “All I know is, again, I’ve been around high school football my entire life. [Driskel is] the best high school football player I’ve ever seen. Period.”
Whether Driskel gets the op-
portunity to shine as a freshman remains to be seen. He expects to 
come to Gainesville in the spring 
and compete for the starting quar -
terback job, but said he will do whatever the coaches ask of him.
Some fans have already started 
to call for the soon-to-be freshman to start next season in hopes that he lives up to the hype and might just be the next Tim Tebow.
“For any true freshman at any 
position, much less quarterback, to be expected to go in there and be the savior, or something like that, that’s a little bit too much to ask,” Gierke said. “But, if there’s anyone that can do that, it’s Jeff, because he’s got the mental makeup, more importantly than anything else, to 
do all that.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15

For the past two races of Florida’s season, 
everything seemed to go right. 
The No. 29 UF women’s team was spend-
ing its weeks repeating as Southeastern Conference champions, returning an All-American back to form and racking up bids to take a shot at the national title. 
But at the NCAA Cross Country National 
Championship on Monday, it all fell apart.
The Gators failed to capitalize on their 
momentum heading into the race and were swallowed by a field of 31 teams that dropped UF to a season-low 29th-place fin-ish in the 6K.
 “Obviously, today we’re disappointed 
with what happened but we’re going to use it for motivation and gear up for track,” as-sistant coach Todd Morgan said.
Florida came into the race with high ex-
pectations after returning three upperclass -
men from last year’s school-record fifth-place team.
Senior Charlotte Browning’s 77th-place 
finish and 21:22.1 run was the best result for Florida on the day but was 56 seconds slower and 56 places lower in the standings that her result from last year in Terre Haute, 
Ind. 
Browning’s fellow All-American from 2009, junior Rebecca Lowe, finished 21 sec-
onds later after being pushed back to 114th 
place and was followed 10 seconds later by freshman Cory McGee in 129th.
The race started with eight minutes of 
steady tempo and pacing due to windy con-
ditions that Morgan said made his team re-
luctant.
“They end up grouping up a little more 
like that when it’s that windy because no 
one really wants to break it,” Morgan said.
Soon after the 12-minute mark, Villano-
va’s Sheila Reid finally made a kick to sepa-
rate the main field and coasted to her first individual title behind a 20:06.9 run. The 
Wildcats also repeated as national champi-
ons.
Upon the finish line over a minute later, 
the Gators were collapsing in exhaustion. 
“They were going for the wall this meet,” 
Morgan said.
In the men’s 10K, Florida’s luck contin-
ued to run short as junior Dumisane Hlaselo 
suffered a sprained ankle after a strong first 7K in the top half of the field. Hlaselo was not able to recover from the late injury, how-ever, and tumbled to 171st place by the time he crossed the finish line. 
The junior from South Africa was the first 
men’s runner to compete at nationals for the Gators since 2008. 
Another individual competitor, Sam Che-
langa of Liberty University, won his second straight national title. And Oklahoma State was named national champions for the sec-ond time in as many seasons.16, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2010

Usually the Gators compete in 
the confines of an echoing, indoor 
natatorium. But today’s meet will be a little twisted. 
The UF swimming and div-
ing team is set to round out their fall season against FSU tonight, in Tallahassee’s outdoor Morcom 
Aquatics Center. 
“We always finish the fall sea-
son against Florida State,” asso-
ciate head coach Anthony Nesty said. “You always want to go out with a win. It’ll be a tough challenge again, we’re going up 
there swimming outdoors at 5 
o’clock in Tallahassee. Hopefully the weather stays warm. It’ll be a good challenge for both the men 
and women.” 
The squads competed against 
the Seminoles this past weekend 
in the Georgia Tech Invitational in Atlanta. 
FSU barely edged the Gators 
on both sides, the men placing in first against the Gators’ second-place finish and the women in 
second, just ahead of the Gators’ 
third-place finish. 
However, the way the Semi-noles treated the Georgia Tech 
Invitational differed from the way 
the Gators approached the com-petition, senior Brett Fraser said.
“FSU prepared for the Geor -
gia Tech Invite 
like an end of the year meet,” he said. “We didn’t. They’re 
tired, we’re not 
and it’ll show [today].” 
UF focuses on 
the Southeastern Conference and NCAA meets the entire season, training hard all fall. The Florida State squad showed 
up to the Invite in speed suits, a tool that the Gators don’t utilize until SEC and NCAA time. 
 “They had to rest to get 
through it and they’re pretty bro-ken down right now,” Fraser said. “We’ll get the job done.”              
Shorthanded Gators: The 
women’s side will be short two 
U.S. National Team members, 
freshman Elizabeth Beisel and ju-nior Teresa Crippen, due to their attendance at last night’s Golden 
Goggle Awards in New York 
City. 
The Golden Goggles Awards is known as the Oscars of the swim-
ming realm, with guests including 
Michael Phelps, Natalie Coughlin and former Gator Ryan Lochte.  
Beisel was nominated for Fe-
male Athlete of the Year, while Crippen was nominated for the Breakout Performer. Coach Gregg Troy was nominated for Coach of the Year. 
Crippen and Beisel will not be 
flying back to Florida for the FSU meet as the coaches don’t want to wear the girls’ bodies down with 
travel. The out-of-state girls will 
also be traveling for Thanksgiv-ing.
