While UF President Bernie Machen was able 
to let loose and lose the tie, his wife, Chris, com-
plained she had to don a head scarf during the couple’s excursion to Iran in November.
The Machens took the stage Tuesday night in 
UF’s Pugh Hall Ocora in front of about 60 people to discuss their recent trip, which was part of an effort to foster science research exchange between 
the U.S. and Iran.
Machen was one of six university 
presidents selected to visit Iranian universities in a delegation organized 
by the Association of American Universities. 
Other universities involved included Cornell 
University and the University of California, Davis. Most of the travel costs were picked up by the Richard Lounsbery Foundation.
Machen told the audience he hopes his trip will 
encourage more Iranian students to apply to UF.
“Ultimately, what (the trip) means for us is 
faculty and students should come here and go there,” he said after the speech. “There should be a free flow.” However, he said, strict U.S. visa policies would have to change in order for that to happen.
Machen said he is also looking forward to  UF 
collaborating with Iranian researchers.
He said he is working with Dennis Steindler, ex-
ecutive director of UF’s McKnight Brain Institute

Second Avenue,  
Saturday 11:50 p.m.
The downtown clubs are swing-
ing. Women wearing mini-dresses move briskly from the warmth of one club to the next. Billy Hunt and Matt, both homeless, stroll to-ward the St. Francis House shelter, watching.
“I know lust is a sin Lord, but 
sometimes they make it so hard,” Matt said, holding his head back and staring at the sky.
Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza, Saturday 11:05, 45 
minutes earlier
Fire of God Ministries’ refur -
bished school bus makes a stop on the south side of Bo Diddley Community Plaza, dropping off people the church has just fed.
A dozen people, nearly all of 
them homeless, get off the bus. Loretta Herring, 57, is among them.
Many of those who stay on are 
headed to shelters where they will spend the night. Herring, who has been homeless for seven years, doesn’t know where she will sleep tonight and asks those around her if they know of a nearby shelter.
She wears all black, clean 
clothes, a scarf, and carries several bags of possessions. Rhinestone-rimmed sunglasses shade her eyes, even though the only light is from scattered street lamps.
Being a homeless woman may 
be difficult, but Herring has sym-pathy for all people in her situa-tion, she said.
“It’s hard just being a human 
and homeless,” she said.
Herring said she is waiting for 
money from family in California so she can join them.  She has waited 
for years.
A small group of homeless and 
needy gather at a plaza bench.
They keep an eye on their 
watches while chatting, smoking cigarettes and eating the take-home that Fire of God hands out after church service.There is an 11:30 curfew for the 
plaza and police usually enforce it strictly. 
Four police officers ride by on 
horseback and the group breaks up, heading in different directions. Two of them, Billy Hunt and Matt, walk toward St. Francis House.

Christian groups win battle
After an 18-month legal battle 
with a Christian student group, UF 
will allow student organizations registered with the university to choose members and award lead-
ership positions based on religion.
Beta Upsilon Chi, or BYX, 
which bills itself as a Christian 
fraternity , filed suit in July of 2007 because it wanted to limit member -
ship to Christians, which violated UF’s nondiscrimination policy for registered student groups.
However, On Jan. 15, UF 
changed the policy and sent letters to three student groups that had been denied the ability to register.
In addition to BYX, UF ad-
dressed Gator Christian Life and Kappa Upsilon Chi, another Christian fraternity that hasn’t reg-istered this semester, according to UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes. UF 
also filed a motion to dismiss the 
suit brought by BYX, Sikes said.
The last action in the case oc-
curred in December, when it went before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A ruling has not been issued yet.

Featuring waterless urinals 
and a natural gas power genera-
tor, Florida’s first environmentally 
friendly fire station opened in 
Gainesville Tuesday.
A ribbon cutting was held at the 
new facility, where about 50 peo-ple, including city commissioners, firefighters and the public, gath-ered to see what the new station had to offer. 
The 5,521-square-foot station 
was about 5 percent more expen-sive than a non-green facility, ac-cording to Bryan Schneider, project coordinator.
However, it was completed un-
der the $1.8 million budget and will ultimately save more money in energy costs.
“Green is the only way to go,” 
said Charlie Jackson, Alachua County facilities manager.
The station’s green features in-
clude water-conserving dual-flush toilets, waterless urinals, solar pan-els for heating water and an energy efficient heating, venting and air conditioning system.
Builders also tried to have mini-
mal environmental impact.
More than 63 percent of con-
struction waste was recycled, said Ivan Oelrich, general contractor. Recycling cost less than sending 
the waste to landfills, he added.
Even the building’s peachy 
paint color was chosen for its low 
sunlight reflection, making it cool-er inside.The idea for the station originat-
ed in 2005 and construction started in 2008. Schneider said plans are in progress to renovate two other Gainesville stations, but the city won’t begin construction until the economy picks back up. 
Fire Chief Ed Bailey said the fire 
station will serve the environment and benefit the public. 
“(This station) will have two 
units and will allow better respon-sive time to fires,” he said.
First ‘green’ fire rescue station opens in Gainesville
FBI to meet with Machen, other university presidents about Iran trip
to bring Iranian faculty and students to the 
institute.
“The one area that I looked at and we’re 
working on right now is stem cell research,” 
he said.
“They’re not on the same restrictions as 
our country is,” he said. “Our government 
restricts the kind of stem cell research we do.”
Machen also mentioned that the FBI has 
taken an interest in the trip. The six uni-versity presidents will be meeting with the agency next week in Washington, he said, to 
share their experiences.
During his speech, Machen said he talked 
with students, faculty and administrators 
from three universities in Tehran.
He said the students were bright, spoke 
English well and were not as isolated from the rest of the world as he had imagined.
Every dorm room he visited was wired 
with the Internet, and students were browsing the same type of content as their peers in the 
U.S., he said.
Machen also said many of 
the professors were not shy about criticizing 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran’s president.
“The intellectuals with whom we inter -
acted quickly separated themselves from their president,” he said.
“We had a lot of common conversation at 
that point in time about a people that are not in sync with their president,” he said. “And we could relate to that.”
There were some things Machen couldn’t 
quite relate to, though.
“One thing I can tell you is there’s no al-
cohol in Iran,” he said. “I learned to like that no-alcohol beer, that’s about the best you can 
do.”IRAn , from page 1“Green is the only way      
to go.”

to Gainesville from Polk County 
on Dec. 31, according to a Polk 
County police report.
He was released with no money 
and no way home.
Because it isn’t yet below 45 de-
grees the Cold Nights Shelter pro-gram is not in effect and it takes 
permission from the police to get into one of the shelters.  
Hunt spots a man lying on the 
ground on a side street next to St. 
Francis House. He is wrapped in 
a sleeping bag and lying with his head against the wheel of a bike.When asked if it is a safe place 
to sleep, the man on the ground re-
plies, “You see where I’m sleeping 
don’t you?”  
But Hunt isn’t convinced. He’d 
rather walk around 
Gainesville all night 
than have another 
run-in with the po-lice, he said. 
After wandering the nearby 
neighborhood, Hunt considers 
searching for Tent City, a homeless 
community in a nearby patch of woods.
He doesn’t know exactly where 
it is. People who live there usually don’t talk about its location.
Just outside Tent City,      
Sunday 12:30 a.m.
As Hunt wanders toward Tent 
City, he tries to recall second-hand descriptions of how to get there.
A man on a bicycle rides up and 
asks Hunt if he  is looking for Tent City. 
His name is Rod.  He says God 
sent him to live in Tent City to help others like himself.
“When it’s cold I won’t let no-
body sleep on the ground,” he said. 
“Now in the summertime, that’s a 
different story.”  
Rod offers an extra tent, and 
Hunt accepts.
Because Tent City has no power, 
the camp is dim, illuminated only 
by sporadic campfires.
“Remember that thing about 
how there are whole different worlds out there?” Billy asked while entering Tent City, “This is one of them.” 
Residents estimate between 40 
and 45 tents make up the city, but the people change from one day to the next. Rod’s extra tent is a red, black and tan Sports Dome tent, and it easily fits two people
As Hunt falls asleep, a nearby 
woman shouts wildly while a man’s low, mumbling voice fills in her silences. Hunt guesses that she caught her man cheating.
A clear sentence surfaces: “I 
want you out of my life!”
Hunt chuckled.“That’s gotta be it,” he said.
Tent City, Sunday 8:30 a.m.
Hunt wakes up and rummages 
through his plastic grocery bags, retrieving a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush.
He donated plasma the day be-
fore to get $35 for necessities: hy-giene products and packs of ciga-rettes, brand 308.
Going a day without brush-
ing his teeth isn’t an option, Hunt said.
Nearby is a nearly empty water 
jug and small bottles of shampoo and conditioner sitting on a wet, wooden clock face. The items be-long to Rod.
He has left for the morning and 
Hunt decides to explore tent city.
Some of the camps are simple, just tents sitting alongside fire pits. 
Others are more elaborate.
Canvases stretched between 
trees create walls and give pri-
vacy to some of the sites. Found art hangs everywhere. At one site, 
Christmas ornaments dangle from 
nets.
Two men built  a giant  dream 
catcher with rope above a tent. Al, 
who helped construct it, said it was 
done out of boredom.
Like most others in tent city, Al 
wants to find work, but can’t, he said.
He said many homeless are 
plagued by criminal records and no money for a driver’s licenses, 
which makes finding even low-
paying jobs nearly impossible. 
Starbucks 201 SE 1st St. 
Sunday 10 a.m.  
Hunt decided he wanted a cup 
of coffee.
On his way, he stopped by St. 
Francis House and ran into an old friend, Anthony Davis. Davis sug-gested Starbucks because of the cheap refills.
They sit at an outside table with 
their coffee and cigarettes to chat.
“The ten year plan to end 
homelessness is out of sight, out of mind,” Davis said. “There are some of us out here who do want to get on their feet.”People on the Streets
Residents estimate the homeless ‘city’ is comprised of 40 to 45 tents

Today’s question: Would you be 
willing to pay a 5-cent tax per alcoholic drink?Tuesday’s question: Results are not available due to technical error.Tequila Tax?Column
Host’s dissent harms bipartisanship Spliff Seizure
Local weed grow-op 
takes a hit
Arguably one of the 
finest traditions of The Gator Nation, 
the relocation of The World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail 
Party should not be taken 
lightly.
While the Editorial Board 
understands Gainesville’s desire to crack down on underage drinking, the pro-posal to eliminate the rite-of-passage jaunt to Jacksonville is not the answer.
We suggest you leave 
the UF-Georgia game alone and worry about what takes place in our city — not what happens one weekend in October over an hour’s drive away.
One reasonable solution 
to cut down on drinking for 
students of all ages would 
be to impose the suggested 5-cent alcohol tax at local bars.
The City of Gainesville 
could then pat itself on the back for at least appearing to take a stance against un-derage drinkers while also collecting a pretty penny to pad its budget.
If imposed, such a tax 
would reap the city mone-tary benefits at the upwards of $10 million to $12 mil-lion per year — not exactly chump change.
The Editorial Board of-
fers our support for the tax, as it would hardly drain the 
pockets of even UF’s biggest 
drinkers. Not to mention the fact the proposed tax would provide funding for police salaries, DUI prevention and alcohol education.
We may not be good at 
math, but we are pretty sure a round of five beers at Gator 
City would only cost a quar -
ter more — one less gumball 
at the supermarket.
On second thought, do 
they even make those any-more? A week into his term, President Barack Obama faces 
stark opposition while trying feverishly to gain bi-partisan support. 
His most outspoken dissenter comes in the form of 
blowhard radio host Rush Limbaugh. After years of de-fending President George W. Bush, Limbaugh is eager to go on the attack — rooting for Obama’s failure.
Stating, “I hope he fails” on day one of Obama’s presi-
dency, Limbaugh used his radio talk show as a soapbox on which to rather proudly proclaim that he would rather 
see the country fall apart than leave it in the hands of a 
left-wing president.
Limbaugh’s dissent over Obama’s call for bipartisan 
support within Congress is nothing more than an attempt to drive a wedge between the two parties. He has made 
it clear that he has his own objectives in mind, and if the 
country has to fall in order for his objectives to be met, so be it.
This is not a man to be taken lightly. An honorary mem-
ber of Congress, Limbaugh has a great deal of influence within the GOP . With thousands of listeners tuning into his nationally syndicated radio show, Obama may have met his match in someone so outrageously drawn to bi-partisan bickering.
We cannot forget that this is the same man who accused 
Michael J. Fox of exaggerating the effects of Parkinson’s disease in order to gain support for stem cell research. Limbaugh unabashedly revels in the attention that the me-
dia give his outlandish comments, so why are they adding 
fuel to the fire?
There has to be more going on in the world right now 
than some pompous old man pledging his disloyalty to our current president’s policies.Nevertheless, it is one thing 
to disagree with the president — Obama himself was, along with 
many others, against Bush’s 
troop surge during the Iraq War. 
We have the right to speak 
out when we think our president 
is steering us in the wrong direc-
tion. However, opposition is not 
the same as hoping for failure; Obama’s failure would 
mean our failure.
Even if Limbaugh wants to see the policies fail, and not 
the man behind them, then the implications of such a fail-
ure are massive. If the country goes down, we’re all going down with it whether we like it or not.
It is justifiable and very American to be skeptical of our 
president, and while Limbaugh’s comments can be seen as selfishly unpatriotic, they do illustrate that we still have the freedom to express dissent. If anything, Limbaugh is 
displaying our Constitutional right of free speech.
We also have the liberty of turning the radio switch to 
“off” when we hear Limbaugh’s smug prattle come on 
air.
A failing economy, terrorists running amok and wars 
going on for years and years — that is what we can look forward to if Limbaugh is granted his wish for Obama’s failure. A lack of success by the new administration will certainly teach us all a lesson for voting “that one” into 
office.
Just don’t think for a moment Limbaugh won’t be there 
to tell us he was right if it happens.
Naudia Jawad is a journalism graduate student. Her col-
umn appears on Wednesdays.Straight out of a scene from “Pineapple Express,” local 
law enforcement and federal agents seized more than $800,000 worth of marijuana plants in Williston.
When news of the bust hit North Central Florida, the 
Editorial Board can only imagine area pot smokers held their collective breath — quickly texting their dealers to assess what this meant for future orders.
Located in an underground grow house mere miles 
south of UF, authorities seized nearly 200 pot plants dis-covered 10 feet beneath a barn on Monday.
What truly epitomized the sophistication of the scheme 
was the trap door covered in hay designed to ward off any 
suspicion of illegal activity.
We wish the Alligator building could magically dis-
guise itself at night so work could get done on time with-
out having to deal with uninvited mystery guests banging 
on our door. 
According to an article in the Gainesville Sun, the op-
eration may have started as far back as 2005, when a fire 
brought officials to the property to assess the situation. Apparently the person who spearheaded the operation 
told the officers at the time that he was burning insulation 
with hopes of constructing a storm bunker for his family.
The Editorial Board confesses such an operation is quite 
the impressive feat. On top of performing the day-to-day 
diligence of maintaining the plants, keeping the grow 
house a secret must have been especially challenging.
Heck, we have trouble just keeping petty newsroom 
gossip to ourselves.

Letters to the Editor
Budget cuts limit recruitment
 In Monday’s edition of the 
Alligator, UF spokesman Steven 
Orlando was reported as saying, 
“Although budget cuts forced UF 
to reduce undergraduate enroll-ment, graduate schools are not affected.” 
The article goes on to say 
that grants and research fund-ing do not support UF’s graduate schools. While graduate school 
acceptance and enrollment may 
not be threatened by past and fu-ture budget cuts, the ability of the departments to entice top candi-dates to the university is greatly limited without the availability of decently-paid stipends, flex-
ible assistantships, etc. 
Moreover, I would also con-sider the merging of departments 
and the suspension or elimination of entire graduate programs (i.e. foreign languages or philosophy) as major effects on the graduate 
schools. 
What is the likelihood of at-tracting the best potential candi-
dates to an academic institution, a former bastion of intellectual-ism, when productivity is mea-sured only by financial gains?

Guest column
Editor’s note: This is a condensed ver-
sion of an e-mail sent to the Alligator in response to the Jan. 22 front-page photo.
I saw today’s issue of the Alligator at work. 
I have to ask, are you proud of the front-page photo? Did someone at the Alligator 
get off on publishing it? Why are you peo-ple at the Alligator constantly harassing 
Christians? That seems to be a popular pas-
time for many people these days. 
 If Preacher J.K. were Muslim, would the 
photo ever have been taken, much less pub-lished? A lot of people are fearful of Muslims, is one reason.
If J.K. had been a Krishna, would that 
photo be in the paper? If J.K. was Buddhist, would you have taken the trouble to allow 
it to be printed? If he were a Wiccan, would 
anyone have ever seen the photo? If J.K. were one of the too many ‘Obama freaks’ around here, would such a photo grace the front page of the Alligator?
Again I ask, why do you do such things, 
and by all appearances, only toward Christians? Are you lacking in worthy ar-ticles or photos to put in your paper, or was 
the Alligator photographer just having a 
dull day? It’s funny that your paper some-times provides listings of some churches in Gainesville that one can attend on Sunday, yet you’ll publish a trashy photo like that. Seems to me like a double standard. 
You people have no respect, especially it 
seems for Christians, even though you claim you value freedom of religion. I also can’t 
help but wonder if Scott Paterson would 
have flipped off Tim Tebow had he had the chance, Tebow being the outspoken Christian and missionary that he is.
Another thing you need to consider is that children can see the front page of the Alligator at various places where it is distributed. I can just hear a 5-year-old girl asking, “Mommy, what’s that man doing with his finger?” 
Unless Comrade Obama and his “com-
munist democrap goons” take away our free-dom of religion, among other freedoms, we still have such.
I don’t know J.K. personally, but J.K. has 
the freedom to preach about the ills and abomination and immorality of homosexual behavior, whether students or professors or administration like it or not. He may not de-liver the message gently or quietly, but it’s 
getting out.
Obviously there are liberal professors at 
UF who will only condone premarital or il-
licit sexual behavior of any sort, but not the moral, upstanding, wait-until-marriage, one man and one woman type. Strange, I’ve nev-
er seen any articles in the Alligator about the 
dangers of STDs or AIDS or the emotional or spiritual consequences of sex of any sort out-side of marriage. Perhaps I’ve missed them. 
Most people are ignorant; they know ho-
mosexuality does involve sex in some fash-
ion. It’s not just about attraction, emotions 
and companionship.
Paterson and Brett Passa are like others: 
they have to show their butts. If they don’t want to hear what J.K. is saying, they should avoid him instead of showing off and mak-ing asses of themselves.
If they can’t handle what he says, that 
God himself through the Holy Bible does speak out against not just homosexual per-version but other perversion as well. Like all people, they have legs, they can walk some 
other direction. 
Paterson and Passa could well pull their foolish, asinine 
stunts on some Christian that is not yet fully sancti-fied and has little 
patience or “tolerance” for such stunts, and they could wind up on the wrong end of someone’s fist.  
Good thing it wasn’t me who Paterson 
flipped off, or me having to deal with such an untalented artist like Passa. In their cases, sometimes people need some sense knocked into them. I, for one, am tired of the anti-Christian agendas and attitudes running 
amok in this country.  
Again, we know there are professors at 
UF (as well as other universities and com-
munity colleges) that absolutely hate and despise Christianity, the Bible and Creation and will stop at nothing to destroy students’ 
faith and confidence in Jesus Christ, the Bible 
and Creation. 
They feel Christians are mindless robots 
that can’t think for themselves. That the Bible is inaccurate, unreliable, bigoted, hate-filled and outdated. I’ve got news for them. They 
could not be further from the truth. Are 
Paterson and Passa examples of the kind of people UF is turning out, or did they just have a bad upbringing? 
I also can’t help but wonder if by chance 
Paterson and Passa are frat boys who might have been drinking too much that day. 
The thing is, MTV , trashy, foul-mouthed 
(C)rap music, garbage for movies, sorry an-ti-Christian TV shows (I could name a few here), the theory of evolution, so-called athe-ism, sex outside of marriage, drunken par-
ties, false religions and cults, overdone sports 
fanaticism, occult-oriented comic books, among many other things, don’t help benefit students’ lives either.
We want a public apology from Paterson 
and Passa for their foolish actions toward J.K., and a public apology to J.K as well. I’m 
sure my wife and I are not the only ones that 
feel this way. 
Many of us Christians around here are 
praying for a revival and a re-awakening at UF and in Gainesville. Not just those places, but for the United States as a whole, includ-ing with those in Washington D.C., at the White House and Congress and Senate.
Just because The Lord God calls homo-
sexuality an abomination does not mean he hates the person, just the perversion. He still loves the person and that person’s soul and has a better plan and life for them. I could also recommend a good solid church here in Gainesville for Paterson or Passa, anyone at 
the Alligator or at UF or in Gainesville for 
that matter.
As far as I’m concerned, I try to avoid the 
Alligator as much as possible. Today’s  front-page photo is one reason why. Sometimes however, I’ll see one laying around some-
where and may look through the classified 
section, as that is all it’s good for.
Here we are asking for a public apology 
from Paterson or Passa, but how? For them to send in a letter of apology to the Alligator would be a start.
They have been forgiven, but what they 
have done or may still do is uncalled for. So it is with the photo. I forgive whoever ran it, but that too was uncalled for. 
I’m sure you and the Alligator staff don’t 
like being flipped off, even in regards to 
whatever those of you there may have.

understand is why fans care.
Every season, we are expected to 
learn the names, stats and life histo-ries of about 20 new players, all of them supposedly capable of mak-ing a gigantic impact on the Gators. Every season, 18-year-olds (and, for that matter, 11-year-olds) get hyped 
up beyond belief thanks to the ability 
of anyone with an Internet connec-tion to post a grainy highlight pack-age on YouTube. Every season, it is made to seem like the future of ath-letic programs — maybe the world — depends on which hat a high school stu-dent who

Last season, Georgia became 
the Southeastern Conference’s 
Cinderella story after an improb-
able run to the SEC Tournament 
title.
The Bulldogs entered the 2008 
SEC Tournament as the confer -
ence’s lowest-seeded team.
Georgia proceeded to win four 
straight games to secure its first NCAA Tournament berth since 2002.
That run included the Bulldogs 
playing three games in two days because of scheduling conflicts after a tornado damaged the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
When the Gators play host 
to the Bulldogs (9-10, 0-4 SEC) 
tonight at 8 in the O’Connell 
Center, they will try to make sure the glass slipper no longer fits.
Georgia is led by senior 
Terrance Woodbury, who is av-
eraging 13 points per game this 
season.
“He’s really important just 
because they play him in two different spots,” UF coach Billy Donovan said.
Woodbury will line up at small forward and power forward for the Bulldogs.
“They’ve got the ability to 
change the complexion of the team,” Donovan said.
“So, Woodbury’s one of those 
guys that gives them as a coach-ing staff a different dimension and a different-looking type of team.”
The Gators (17-3, 4-1 SEC) 
come into the game after a roller coaster week that saw UF lose to South Carolina on the final play of the game last Wednesday and 
then bounce back with a 25-point 
thrashing of 
Vanderbilt on Sunday.
“You talk 
about a game on Wednesday that was emotion-
ally heartbreaking to a game on 
Sunday where we shot the ball 
very, very well and were able to win on the road,” Donovan said. 
“Our guys’ ability to keep the 
perspective of how quickly you 
can change (is important). 
“I would hope that what hap-
pened on Wednesday and what 
happened again on Sunday is a 
great case to really, really show 
the ability (to learn from a loss),”

The UF women’s tennis doubles teams had a 
whole lot of love for Stetson.
All three Gators’ (2-0) duos posted an 8-0 
score on its Hatters opponent in a 6-1 dual match 
win on Tuesday.
The freshman pair of Jo Mather and Barbara 
Pinterova beat Shannon Gunning and Katherine St. Clair.
“The young team is coming around a lot,” UF 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “The other two, I think, have played probably above expectations so far.”
The No. 18 pairing of Marrit Boonstra and 
Megan Alexander defeated Breanna Atkinson 
and Katherine Nowicki on Court 1, while Jessica 
Alexander and Anastasia Revzina dominated Valentina Galbarini and Natalie Gorham.
“Doubles is good. That’s traditionally been one 
of our stronger points,” Thornqvist said of the No. 7-ranked Gators.
Jessica Alexander is enjoying her time in the 
doubles court.
“I really like playing with Nastia,” Jessica 
said of her partner. “She has a lot of power, so I just have to smother the net and make sure to clean up everything else.”
Revzina shares the senti-
ment.
“We get along so good, 
and our chemistry is good,” 
the junior said.
After posting a 3-0 lead 
in her first singles set, Jessica retired from the match due to a wrist injury. The forfeit was pre-cautionary.
“(Her wrist) was not a problem,” Thornqvist 
said. “It was just my call. I told her she would 
play doubles and three (singles) games, sort of

SUPER BOWL XLIII
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — Pittsburgh is back 
at the Super Bowl, and so is 
retired Steelers running back 
Jerome Bettis.
The Bus broke out his NFL 
championship ring from three 
years ago for interviews Tuesday 
as part of NBC’s broadcast team 
for Sunday’s title game. He said it feels a little strange to be here as a pregame analyst rather than playing for his former team.
“It’s kind of weird because you 
know the experience and you’re familiar with it, and you’re famil-iar with the guys. But now you’re 
kind of on the outside looking in, 
instead of on the inside looking out,” Bettis said.
“But it’s fun because for me 
there’s no pressure. I get a chance 
to interact with the guys. ... I can 
still get access without the other pressures. A little part of me says, ‘Man, you possibly could 
be in that game.’ But the other 
side of me says, ‘Naw, I wouldn’t have been able to make it to this point.” 
Bettis, who rushed for 10,571 
yards and 78 touchdowns for the Steelers from 1996-2005, retired 
after Pittsburgh won its fifth 
Super Bowl by beating Seattle 21-
10 in his hometown of Detroit.
He’s made a smooth transition 
from the playing field to life after 
football and said he rarely wears 
his championship ring.
“The first couple of months 
I wouldn’t take it off,” he said. “Now, it’s just media situa-
tions.”
Bettis has spoken with sev-
eral of his former teammates, 
but hasn’t offered any advice 
for Sunday’s game against the 
Arizona Cardinals.
“I really haven’t told them 
anything. I’ve just talked to them as a friend, as a confidant, not 
really as ‘Hey, do this, do that,’ 
because they’ve all been here be-fore. ... They know what needs to be done. So it was really just 
congratulating them and letting 
them know this is a great oppor -
tunity for them and don’t lose sight of it.”Bus stops

Retired Steelers running backBy EUGENIO TORRENS

The first thing the UF 
gymnastics team talked 
about on the bus after it lost to Arkansas last Friday was 
quarterback Tim Tebow’s speech after the Mississippi game.
Following the football 
team’s loss to Mississippi on Sept. 27, Tebow promised no one would work harder on the field, and the team rode his promise to deliverance: a 
national championship.
It seems the Razorbacks 
may prompt the No. 5 UF 
gymnastics team to do the same: work harder.
“This (loss) is going to 
cause them to go back in the gym and train harder than they’ve ever trained before,” 
UF coach Rhonda Faehn 
said. 
Injuries and the toll they 
are taking on the team may have played a role in cost-
ing the team the meet against 
Arkansas.
That could change this 
week with UF coach Rhonda 
Faehn telling her team to face 
its fears.
“We can’t be afraid of any 
more injuries,” Faehn said. 
“We have to go out and train 
and compete exactly how we normally would for the best results.”
Injuries to juniors Rebekah 
Zaiser and Amanda Castillo and now freshman Nicole Ellis have prevented the team from having a meet-to-meet lineup, especially on balance beam.
“We have to just get con-
sistency in the lineup,” Faehn 
said. 
Consistency will develop 
into a comfortable rhythm, 
yielding better results, she said.
Inconsistent performanc-
es plus three falls in a row against the Razorbacks on Friday mean a new beam 
lineup for the fourth consec-
utive meet.
Freshman Kailey Tissue 
will be performing on beam for the first time in orange 
and blue.
Even though veterans 
Castillo and Corey Hartung 
suffered uncharacteristic falls 
Friday night in Fayetteville, 
Ark., Faehn said they will be back on beam as well.
Sophomore Alicia 
Goodwin, the third Gator 
who fell during the Arkansas 
meet, will not be competing on beam.
She will instead be doing 
exhibition work.
The team will take its new 
beam lineup and look to re-bound against Kentucky in the O’Connell Center Friday 
night at 7. 
Fans are encouraged to 
wear pink, as the meet, offi-
cially called the Gators Link 
to Pink meet, is aimed at rais-
ing breast cancer awareness.
“We love our blue and or -
ange,” Faehn said, “but they get excited to be able to put 
pink on.”WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 28, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 15

 MIAMI COMMISSIONERS WILL 
VOTE ON FINAL CONTRACTS. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — Designs for the Florida 
Marlins’ new ballpark were released for 
the first time Tuesday, more than two weeks before Miami and Miami-Dade commissioners vote on the stadium the 
team has long craved.
The plans show how the $515-mil-
lion ballpark is expected to help invigo-
rate the Little Havana neighborhood on the site of the now-demolished Orange Bowl near downtown. The retractable-roof stadium has a mostly white exte-rior with windows beyond part of the outfield seats and palm trees lining the 
entrance.
Since their first game in 1993, the 
Marlins have played at Dolphin Stadium, 
which is also where the Miami Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes play football. The ballpark is a major piece of a $3 bil-lion public works package that includes a tunnel for the Port of Miami and a downtown trolley line. City and county 
commissioners are scheduled to vote on 
the final contracts Feb. 13.
The Marlins, who perennially have 
one of the lowest payrolls in the major 
leagues, say the ballpark will ensure higher revenue, allowing the team to spend more on players.

UF looks to make statement after dropping from top 25 this week
Freshman Pinterova captures crowd’s attention in day’s longest match
The five-star wide receiver out of Hillsborough, ranked 
No. 3 in his class at the position on Scout.com, came to 
Gainesville with much fanfare.
On Sept. 9, 2006, his first outing in Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium, Fayson rushed three times for 28 yards and saw 
one catch for 9 yards.
But after two years in town with average statistics, 
Fayson decided being a Gator wasn’t for him. He transferred 
to Illinois and coach Ron Zook, and no one here cares any-more.
In five years, will anyone remember the mark Jai Lucas left 
on the UF basketball program? How about Mon Williams’ tenure in orange and blue? Does the name Nyan Boateng ring a bell to anyone? And could anyone have predicted the horrible turn for the worse Cam Newton took that now has him at a junior college in Texas? The answer is almost cer -
tainly no.
Recruiting is a crapshoot, plain and simple. It can’t be 
trusted to produce the results you expect. Most highly tout-ed players coming out of high school are simply not mature enough — physically or mentally — to make an immediate impact at their school of choice. 
Of course there is always going to be a player like Tim 
Tebow, Percy Harvin or Jeff Demps who comes out swinging his freshman year. Andre Debose of Seminole High might be that player this year.
But for the most part, we won’t be hearing names like 
Mike Gillislee, Nick Alajajian or even Jordan Reed for an-other year.
I’m not discounting the importance of recruiting. Believe 
me, I understand that Urban Meyer wouldn’t take plane trips across the country if he didn’t think an athlete was going to help bring another national championship to Gainesville. What I am discounting is the hype and hullabaloo surround-ing a bunch of unproven athletes putting pen to paper.
National Signing Day also discounts players whose effect 
on a program will be felt earlier than expected. Was any-one making a big deal about Brandon James? The two-star recruit out of St. Augustine wasn’t ranked at all as a run-ning back, but has turned into one of the nation’s best kick returners.
This whole off-the-field mess just isn’t for me.When these new recruits make their presence known on 
the field, then I’ll start paying attention.NOTE: We’re still taking suggestions for video games to in-clude in our poll for the best sports video game ever. E-mail me your suggestions and I’ll get the votes tallied. I’ll stop 
taking e-mails Friday and put up a poll that night.Hoops , from page 13

The Gators knocked off the 
Commodores for an emotional 
22-point win at home last season, 
only to fall off the map shortly af-ter, losing eight of their final 11 games, including a 3-point loss at 
Vanderbilt.
Donovan hopes that this time around, his team will keep 
enough composure to deal with the same kind of success.
“As much as I said after the 
South Carolina game that we 
had the greatest opportunity 
for growth and development on our team, I think the same is the case coming out of this game on 
Sunday,” Donovan said.
Despite falling out of the na-tional rankings Monday, the 
Gators’ postseason hopes are alive and well after their win against the Commodores in Nashville, Tenn.
UF received 65 Associated 
Press votes, the fourth-most for teams outside the Top 25. 
The Gators also received 59 
votes in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches’ poll, the most of any team outside the Top 25.
“There are experiences during 
the course of the year that can do two things: The experience can really bring the team together, or it can really divide your team,” Donovan said. 
“That’s what conference play 
is all about. It’s all about dealing 
with adversity, and I think ad-
versity comes in a lot of different forms. 
“It comes through winning, it 
comes through losing, and it’s all about how you handle that.”
“They’ve got the ability to 
change the complexion of 
the team.”

overdo it.”
“It’s feeling pretty good,” the freshman said 
of her serving wrist. “I could’ve gone longer.”
Thornqvist might have pushed the point.
“I told her, ‘If you go down three, I’m gon-
na make you play three more,’” he said.
Jessica is enjoying recovery time before 
Saturday’s Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championship opener 
against Oklahoma State.
“Originally , (on Saturday), I didn’t plan on 
playing the full match, but it felt really good and I did,” she said. “Yesterday it was pretty sore, so today Roland and (associate head coach Dave Balogh) wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to be so sore for the weekend.”
Revzina followed up a hard-fought singles 
win Saturday with a 6-1, 6-1 rout of Atkinson.
“She played today like she did in the (10-
1) tiebreaker on Saturday ,” Thornqvist said. “We’ve spent some time just talking about fo-cus and the mental side of her play more so 
than the physical side, and I 
thought she did a great job to-
day.”
Revzina was pleased by her 
own performance.
