 A former UF nuclear engineering pro-
fessor was sentenced to six months in 
prison Tuesday.
  Samim Anghaie, found guilty of 
fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in government contracts in February, will go to prison Jan. 9. His wife, Sousan, was sentenced to six months of home conﬁ  ne-ment for her role in the crime.
  The couple must pay the federal gov-
ernment $390,252 in addition to $100,000 in ﬁ  nes each.
  The Anghaies were convicted in Feb-
ruary of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and more than 24 counts of wire fraud.  The maximum penalty for each count of wire fraud is 20 years in prison.
  The couple was accused in 2009 of submitting false information to obtain contracts from NASA and the U.S. Air Force. 
  Some of the false information included 
research taken from UF students without their knowledge. 
  The Anghaies were 
the targets of a fed-eral investigation that included a search of Samim Anghaie’s UF ofﬁ  ce.
  The university 
placed Samim Anghaie on leave in February 2009, and he resigned 
in November of that year after an ad-ditional internal investigation, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.   Had he not resigned, he would have been terminat-ed, she said.    Former professor sentenced to

 The Student Health Care Center has re-
ceived 1,000 additional ﬂ  u shots after the 
original 5,000 ordered were administered in early November.
  The additional shots are a new vaccine 
being used for the ﬁ  rst time in the U.S. this ﬂ  u season. Unlike the regular shot, the intradermal ﬂ  u vaccine uses a needle 90 percent smaller that injects into the skin instead of the muscle, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention. 
  “They [the ﬂ  u shots] were more in de-
mand, so we looked to other options,” said Catherine Seemann, SHCC market-ing specialist.
  The new ﬂ  u shots are available at the 
SHCC. They will also be administered on the Reitz Union Colonnade from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Dec. 6 and 7. 
  Seasonal inﬂ  uenza activity commonly 
peaks in January and February, but it can start in October and last until May, ac-cording to the CDC.
  Last year the SHCC ordered 10,000 ﬂ  u 
shots and administered about 7,000.
  So far, the SHCC has not seen an in-
crease in the number of ﬂ  u cases com-pared to previous years. Flu activity in Florida has also remained consistent, See-mann said.
  However, the SHCC does see a trend of 
more   students getting cold and ﬂ  u symp-toms in the   winter.

getting sick during her ﬁ  rst week of ﬁ  nal exams.

ALLIANCE HELD A TEACH-IN ON TURLINGTON PLAZA.

 Temperatures in the 50s didn’t 
stand in the way of more than 30 
students who gathered on Tur-lington Plaza to talk about their money.
  About 10 members of the Gator 
Student Alliance held a teach-in at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday to in-form students about tuition hikes, decreases in the Bright Futures Scholarship Program funding and Florida’s education cuts. 
  The alliance discussed its mis-
sion for about 20 minutes. 
  “We have cut education more 
than any other state in the United States,” said Cassia Laham, a 22-year-old political science senior and state coordinator for the alli-ance. 
  “Unemployment has doubled 
since 2008 — that’s since my fresh-man year,” she said.
  Speakers used charts to help students understand Florida’s  education funding and the steady decline of Bright Futures ﬁ  nanc-ing.
  “That’s a huge reason I’m at 
a state school — because of the cost,” said Heather Rosenblatt, an 18-year-old psychology freshman.
  Standing up against UF’s year-
ly 15 percent tuition increase is important, she said.
  The alliance is rallying against 
tuition increases at 1:30 p.m. today on Turlington Plaza. Members will follow the rally with a march to the Board of Trustees’ meeting in Emerson Alumni Hall to propose their mandates.
  The group plans to demand 
the Board of Trustees to vote against yearly tuition increases, said Chrisley Carpio, a 19-year-old history sophomore and head organizer and facilitator for the alliance.  Students protest tuition hikes, budget cuts

A new proposed fee for under -
graduates and the elimination of 
payout for unused sick leave to university employees highlight topics that will be addressed at today’s UF Board of Trustees meeting.
The creation of a new “under -
graduate enhancement fee” is up for consideration by the board, UF’s highest governing body. 
According to the board agen-da, the fee would be intended to “enhance the educational oppor -
tunities afforded to undergradu-
ates by en-hancing course offerings, aca-demic facilities and teaching staff.”
Further de-
tails on the fee will be pro-
vided at the meeting of the Com-mittee on Educational Policy and Strategy.The Board of Governors, the 
state university system’s high-est governing body, would have to approve the proposal before it takes effect. 
Under another proposal, em-
ployees leaving the university would no longer get paid for un-used sick leave. Employees hired before April 1, 2010, with 10 years of service would still be eligible for payouts.
The proposal does not change 
sick-leave accrual.

Six UF students are trying 
to raise awareness about local 
homeless youth and encourage students to take action.
Transient Children of Ala-
chua County is hosting “Home-less for the Holidays” from noon to 2 p.m. Friday on the Plaza of the Americas.
“Ultimately , the event is 
designed to try and engage the community to get involved with the issue,” said Daniela Abratt, a 20-year-old journalism senior and group project leader. 
The event is part of a project 
by students in professor John Kaplan’s Social Media and So-cial Responsibility class. 
“The goal of TCAC is to 
document homeless children in Alachua County and to tell their personal stories through in-depth reporting, feature writing and photography ,” said Henry Taksier, a 22-year-old journalism senior.
According to the TCAC, 
56,680 students in Florida do not have a home to go to during the holiday season. In Alachua County alone, 594 students lack a stable place of residence. 
Homeless youth advocates 
will speak at the event, and visitors will be able to make holiday posters to be sent to St. Francis House and the In-terfaith Hospitality Network of Greater Gainesville.

Nikhil Kundra started Teechy, a business that of-
fers technology support.
The 22-year-old also helped create Partender, 
which offers a faster way for bartenders to complete 
their bar inventory accurately. Instead of inventory taking about six hours, Partender reduces the time to 30 minutes. 
Kundra said his success comes from what he is 
learning as a graduate student at the Thomas S. John-son Master of Science in Entrepreneurship Program at the Hough Graduate School of Business, which has been selected as a finalist for the 2012 United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneur-ship.
The winner will be announced in New Or-
leans during the USASBE’s annual confer-ence, which will be held from Jan. 12 to 15. Past winners include Harvard University, Indiana University and the University of Texas.
The 30-credit program at UF, which lasts for 10 
months, includes a trip to Dublin, Ireland. 
During one class in MSE, a group of students cre-
ate and launch a business by the end of the program.
“Our students are immersed in entrepreneur 
culture,” said MSE Program Director Chris Tassin. “When they graduate, they know what they are do-ing.”
Kelly Riley, a 23-year-old graduate student in the 
program, is working with her group on BarkUp!, a so-cially responsible business that creates dog apparel.
“This class makes us aware of opportunities out 
there besides corporate America,” Riley said.
Kundra said that with the introduction of Groove-
shark, he sees Gainesville starting to follow into a trend of entrepreneurial businesses.
“I’ve always had ideas,” Kundra said. “Now class-
es are teaching me how to manage, how to change and how to think differently.” 
Kundra plans on continuing his businesses.“Everything I do in class intertwines with what I’m 
starting,” he said.Entrepreneurship program selected

� POLICE ARE LOOKING 
FOR THE GUNMAN.

A 69-year-old man was hit in 
the face with a gun Tuesday night 
after he was robbed on Santa Fe College’s downtown campus.
At about 10:30 p.m., the victim 
was sitting on a bench with his lap-top using Wi-Fi Internet near Santa Fe College’s Blount Center on 401 NW 6th St. when a dark-colored sports car, possibly a Chevy Ca-maro, approached him, according to Gainesville Police.
The victim told police a light-
skinned black man, about 5 feet 8 inches wearing a dark-colored hat and red bandana around his face, got out of the car, held a dark fire-arm up to the victim’s head and said, “Give it up.” 
After giving his Acer laptop to 
the attacker, the victim told police the man, who looked between 25 and 35 years old, hit him in the forehead with a gun. He said it looked like a semi-automatic handgun. The attacker then ran to his car and fled southbound. 
Cpl. Angelina Valuri, GPD pub-
lic information officer, said that during most robberies, the suspect is primarily focused on getting the victim’s property and leaving the area as soon as possible. 
“The fact that the victim was 
hurt after he turned over his be-longings is highly unusual,” Valuri said. 
Police are still looking for the 
gunman. Any witnesses or anyone with more informationl are asked to contact police at 352-955-1818.Man robbed at Santa Fe

Four gifts lay on a couch in UF 
President Bernie Machen’s office, 
wrapped like they belonged under a Christmas tree. 
Santa Claus didn’t bring the gifts; 
the Gator Students Against Sweat-shops did. 
About 2 p.m. Wednesday , 10 
students marched from the Plaza of the Americas to Tigert Hall carrying the packages to protest UF’s affilia-tion with Adidas. The company pro-duces some of its apparel in factories with sweatshop conditions, and the company supplies apparel to UF.
One of the packages delivered to 
Machen’s office was meant to repre-sent the broken promise that UF ap-parel would be produced only with the use of factories with sweatshop-free conditions. The other three represented each of the group’s de-mands, according to Gator Students Against Sweatshops President Elena Quiroz.
One of Adidas’ factories, PT Ki-
zone, in Indonesia, closed in Janu-ary . The owner closed the shop and fled without paying the workers. 
One of the group’s demands is 
for Adidas to pay the workers $1.8 million in severance.
Adidas is the only company 
that has not paid any of the amount owed to the PT Kizone workers, said Morena Hadziselimovic, a 21-year-old political science junior and cre-ative director of Gator Students Against Sweatshops.
“We believe that this sort of di-
rect action is the best way to get the university’s attention,” she said.
The goal of the march was to put 
pressure on UF and, in turn, put pressure on Adidas to pay the work-ers, said Layla Schuster, a 19-year-old pre-pharmacy sophomore.
When they reached the presi-
dent’s office, he wasn’t there. However, Beth Boone, Machen’s executive assistant, listened as one member read a letter to the UF presi-dent. 
She would ensure that he got the 
letter, she said. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

When is the Florida 
DCF supposed to care?
A closer look into the Florida Department of Children 
and Families reveals a troubling history. 
Recently, local authorities were called to Orange 
River Elementary School in Fort Meyers after the assistant principal was warned of a horrible incident. 
Two 12-year-old girls were reportedly arguing about who 
a male classmate liked better when one girl decided to go up to the boy and kiss him. A teacher spotted the incident and reported it to the assistant principal. 
In defense of the teacher and the administrator, local 
school districts are required by law to call the DCF if they suspect abuse, and according to the Naples Daily News, DCF Sun Coast Region spokeswoman Terri Durdaller encourages these calls. 
But the DCF should really not be concerned with a “kiss-
ing” incident. It should instead turn its attention to its hor-rible record on responding to child abuse as well as its inef-ficient foster care system in the state. 
In February of this year, the DCF failed to respond to re-
ports of child abuse, which eventually led to the death of 10-year-old Nubia Barahona at the hands of her foster par-ents, Jorge and Carmen Barahona. Nubia’s body was found in a bag inside a pest control truck on Interstate 95 along with her twin brother, who had acid on his body. The brother was alive.
Carmen Barahona’s 7-year-old granddaughter reported 
the abuse to an adult who eventually tried to report it to the DCF. The adult was told the department did not conduct in-vestigations on weekends, which is not true. 
In May, a baby boy was murdered by his mother’s boy-
friend, who had been suspected of child abuse. Hillsborough Kids Inc., a nonprofit that is sponsored in part by the DCF, contracted a social worker from Mental Health Care Inc. to visit the family. She apparently found no reason to be alarmed by the boyfriend’s past record. 
But the DCF does not just have a record of putting the lives 
of children in danger. When Deb and Doug Carlson of Miami adopted twin boys from foster care in 2007, they were told the boys suffered from ADHD. What they were not told by child-care officials was that the boys had other mental health problems and had moved from one foster home to another. The now-teenage boys have stolen the parents’ credit cards and threatened to kill them. 
From 2008 to 2009, Florida had 3,777 adoptions. During 
this same time period, there were 200 cases of adoptive par-ents attempting to return children to foster care after they had been adopted or during the adoption process. The Carlsons have said the DCF has left them completely out to dry in trying to care for the boys’ destructive behavior and mental health issues.
Clearly, normal puberty-driven kissing outbursts should 
be of least concern to the DCF. The DCF has a lot of internal issues that need to be worked out before it can continue its child-care services.

from on high? Commercialism entering its stron-gest quarter?
Why, all of this can only mean one thing! And it’s not 
Christmas.
No, what the end of 2011 brings is more than stockings 
hung from the chimney with care. It brings the final days of what I can safely say was one of the best years of my life. It brings the start of my last semester as an undergraduate stu-dent. If you believe the Mayans, it also brings the end of the world. But I’m somewhat skeptical of that.
What all of this means for me, personally, is that I’m en-
tering a major transition in my life. UF will soon become part of my past rather than my all-encompassing present. And if that’s not a good time to look back on everything this school has provided, I don’t know when is.
For all its flaws, UF has been a great place to grow up. 
I say grow up because there’s no denying that the person I was when I entered Hume Hall in 2008 is not the person I am now. Back then, for example, I thought spending more than $500 a month on a dorm room was an intelligent use of money.
I also thought I could skip class every day , meal plans 
were honest bargains on food and I had all the appropriate time-management skills to coast through my college experi-ence with ease.
But the most important thing I’ve learned during my time 
here is not to take any opportunity for granted.
I’ve learned how amazing it is to be attending this school 
that has so much to offer. Each of us is a student (or faculty member) of one of the largest universities in the nation. We’re surrounded by so many chances to do things we’ll never again be able to do.
I don’t just mean the free movies at the Reitz Union, ei-
ther.
I mean the academic, intellectual and cultural expan-
sions that happen every single day as long as you’re willing to engage in them. I’m still young, ideological and stupid. But I was even more of all of those things when I came to this school. I thought I might even be a liber -
tarian!
Spoiler: I was wrong.But I learned that by ventur -
ing out and taking the chance to attend meetings, listen to lectures and see Bob Barr speak to a crowd of supporters, I didn’t just grow in 
knowledge but in experiences that I wouldn’t have been able to get if I hadn’t made the leap.
I’ve spent the past several months writing for the Alliga-
tor, and it’s been the sort of experience I’d have always kicked myself about if I hadn’t taken the initiative to do it. I’m not into journalism. I’m not an English major. I’ve written for a few websites here and there, but I’m pretty sure the Internet thing is just a dying fad. So working with the Alligator this semester has been an opportunity I would have never had in any other setting.
It’s because of this experience that I got bashed by strang-
ers who disagreed with me and misinterpreted by belligerent readers who didn’t care for my picture (at least that’s what I’ve convinced myself they dislike about me). I’ve learned that separating partisanship from politics is impossible in any discussion. And I’ve gotten to see just how hard it is to appeal to people when you’re writing about something other than pop culture.
And for all of that, I’m thankful. It’s the sort of thing that 
UF provides an unparalleled opportunity to do.
Most of you already know this, of course. But it’s nice to 
have a reminder. For the rest of you: Trust me on this. Reach out. Take a chance. Expand your mind and seize the day . You won’t always find it so easy to do that.
Oh, and move out of Broward. Bunk beds really aren’t 
that cool.

Anti-discrimination should be focus for 
LGBT community 
In the past decade alone, the landscape 
of the gay and lesbian fight for equality has changed dramatically. 
Same-sex marriage is now legal in six 
states, gay couples can now adopt in Flor-ida, gay soldiers can now serve openly in the military and it appears the Defense of Marriage Act is on its way out as legitimate policy. 
Yet, it seems bittersweet that at a time 
where such progress is being achieved, oth-ers are being left out. 
While most of the gay-rights advocates 
are focusing on marriage equality, few groups are focusing on transgender discrim-ination. 
These people face enormous obstacles 
every day in simply trying to express their identities. 
From ordinarily mundane tasks like go-
ing to the restroom to extraordinary situa-tions like being placed in juvenile centers, transgender people have to battle with their gender constantly. 
Due to society’s imposed significance on 
gender, these individuals are pressured to either identify as male or female or  other-wise be excluded. 
Governmental programs are inherently 
gender-biased and discriminate against transgender people. 
In Gainesville, we are fortunate to have 
citywide and university-wide gender iden-tity nondiscrimination policies. 
This is a start to forming a better world 
for these people, but until we stop only fo-cusing on marriage equality, progress will not occur.

Minority group needs more attention 
When you think of a minority, what comes to mind? 
For most, the popular groups such as 
women and African-Americans are the first to occupy your thoughts. 
However, there is another minority group 
just as large and just as important as these. There is a community in our society that has been ignored for centuries. 
Aristotle claimed that they were incapa-
ble of being educated, and society has sim-ply pushed them aside for the most part. 
A professor at UF once told me that if ev-
ery member of this minority group from all over the world came together, it would be the third-largest nation on the planet. 
Most readers will not have a clue about 
which group I am referring to. The invisible minority in our society is the deaf. 
The issue of deaf discrimination is rarely 
discussed in the public discourse. In fact, it is rarely discussed at all due to lack of knowledge. 
The deaf community faces discrimination 
from all ends, including education, employ-ment and more. Due to a communication barrier, this minority group is labeled as dis-abled and often referred to as dumb.
The deaf have their own culture and use 
their own language just like other groups that have fought for equal rights over the years. 
The problem is that the deaf community 
is largely ignored by society, and their voic-es have yet to be heard. 
We live in a hearing world controlled by 
hearing people, and this gives the deaf very little power. They rely on interpreters and closed-captioning to function. 
We need to learn about this minority 
group just as we learn about all of the others in every history class. We need to attempt to communicate with and accommodate this group of people simply because they de-serve the same rights as everyone else. 
For more information, look into an orga-
nization called Signing Gators here at UF.

Country singer Mindy Mc-
Cready said Wednesday she will 
probably not be able to bring her 5-year-old son back to Florida to fulfill a judge’s order by Thurs-day afternoon — because she is nearly seven months pregnant with twins. 
By not returning as ordered, 
she risks arrest.
McCready said that she and 
her mother have had a long custody battle in Florida over Zander. Her mother was awarded 
guardianship in 2007.
The battle became more pub-
lic this week, when the Florida Department of Children and Families said a missing person report was filed with police after McCready took Zander from her father’s home. 
McCready was able to visit 
with the boy there because of a court order and the 36-year-old singer said she had spent much of the past month with her son at the home. 
Her mother and father are di-
vorced.
McCready alleges that her 
son suffered abuse while living at her mother’s home and that is one of the reasons why she left with the boy last week.
“I’m a mom first,” said Mc-
Cready from Nashville, Tenn. “No matter what happens, I’m going to protect my kid. If I have to go to jail, so be it.”

Don’t worry about packing on the pounds as 
you get older.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
announced Tuesday that obesity screening and be-
havioral counseling will be covered by Medicare.
The center estimated more than 30 percent of 
current Medicare recipients would be categorized as obese and would therefore qualify for this ben-efit, according to a news release.
About 26 percent of Alachua County is obese, 
according to data from the Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention.
R. Paul Duncan, department chair of UF’s De-
partment of Health Services Research, Management and Policy, said he views this decision as a “worth-while and positive change.”
By working against obesity, he said, the benefit 
is also working to prevent other conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.
People with a body mass in-
dex of 30 or more are considered obese. Body mass index is a mea-sure of a person’s body fat based on his or her height and weight. The normal range for a healthy person is between 18.5 and 25.
Under the new Medicare 
plan, people who qualify can re-ceive six months of free dietary 
and behavioral counseling sessions.
If the patient loses at least 6.6 pounds during the 
course of the sessions, he or she will be eligible for another six months of sessions.Obesity screenings will now be 
covered by Medicare, Medicaid

RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) — Firefighters were needed 
stat after a flying squirrel went nuts in a New Jersey 
hospital’s emergency room.
The squirrel kept launching itself from an 8-foot-
high wall-mounted lamp into a glass wall after be-coming trapped in a trauma room at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Rahway on Tuesday night.
Fire Department spokesman Capt. Ted Padavano told The Star-Ledger of Newark it would climb up on a light and would jump off and glide.
A pair of firefighters threw a blanket over the 
squirrel and released it into a wooded area outside the hospital.
Padavano believes there may be a nest in the 
building because it’s the second time in two weeks that a flying squirrel got in the ER.

Mycal Hixon spends his 
afternoons tutoring low-in-
come students who, he said, come from broken families and lack a role model in their lives.
This year, the number of 
those students is the highest it’s been in the past decade.
About 7,700, or 25 percent, 
of children across the county were living in poverty in 2010, said Vicki Glasier, a public affairs specialist for the U.S. Census Bureau. The data was collected as part of the American Community Survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.
In 2000, 14.7 percent of 
Alachua County’s students were living in poverty. 
A family of four with two 
children would be living in poverty with an income less than $22,113, according to the census.
The surveys are first mailed 
to a sample of 3,000,000 households in the U.S. The census follows with phone and door-to-door interviews if the mailed surveys are not returned, Glasier said.
Neil Donovan, the execu-
tive director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, said the U.S. Census Bureau excludes homeless people from statistics.
According to the census, 
more than 5 million children lived in poverty nationwide in 2010, which is 1.1 million more than in 2009.
Homelessness and pover -
ty can affect children physi-cally and psychologically, Donovan said. 
Obesity is a common 
problem for children living in poverty as they develop unhealthy eating habits. 
“Going without a meal 
increases the likelihood of becoming obese,” Donovan said.
Student United Way spon-
sors the Weekend Hunger Backpack Program, in which volunteers fill backpacks with food to give to Alachua County students.
Children who grow up in 
poverty are affected into their adult years, Donovan said.
“When you grow up in 
poverty, regardless of be-ing provided with some op-portunities, you are almost damned to be on public as-sistance for the rest of your life,” he said. Twenty-five percent 
of children in Alachua County live in poverty

This image shows the entrance to a cross-border tunnel in San Diego on Tuesday,  
the latest in a spate of secret passages found to smuggle drugs from Mexico. 
NATIONAL
SAN DIEGO — Tis the season for finding 
cross-border drug tunnels.
The latest secret passage — equipped with 
a hydraulic lift, electric rail carts and a wooden 
staircase — was discovered Tuesday on the U.S.-Mexico border, highlighting an emerging seasonal trend. For three years, authorities have found sophisticated tunnels shortly before the winter holidays in what officials speculate is an attempt by drug smugglers to take advantage of Mexico’s fall marijuana harvest.
The discovery of the 600-yard tunnel result-
ed in seizures of 32 tons of marijuana, one of the largest pot busts in U.S. history. It linked warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana and was equipped with lighting and ventilation. Wood-en planks lined the floor about 40 feet under -
ground.
“This is an incredibly efficient tunnel de-
signed to move a lot of narcotics,” said Derek Benner, U.S. Immigration and Customs En-forcement’s special agent in charge of investi-gations in San Diego.
Authorities recovered nearly 17 tons of mar -
ijuana at the warehouse in San Diego’s Otay Mesa area, nearly 12 tons inside a truck in Los Angeles and about 4 tons in Mexico. Six people were charged in federal court in Southern Cali-fornia with conspiracy to distribute marijuana.
As U.S. authorities heighten enforcement 
on land, tunnels have become a major tack to smuggle enormous loads of marijuana. More than 70 passages have been found on the bor -
der since October 2008, surpassing the number of discoveries in the previous six years.
Two weeks ago, authorities seized 17 tons 
of marijuana in connection with a tunnel that linked warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana.
Raids last November on two tunnels linking 
San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 52 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border. In early December 2009, authorities found an incomplete tunnel that stretched nearly 900 feet into San Diego from Tijuana, equipped with an elevator at the Mexican entrance.
“If they can’t cross the border above ground, 
they attempt to tunnel underneath it,” said Laura Duffy, the U.S. attorney in San Diego.
Authorities say central Mexico’s marijuana 
harvest in early October presents drug cartels with a familiar challenge for any farmer: how to quickly get products to consumers.
“It’s a significant amount of inventory that 
the cartels need to move, and they need to move it in the most expeditious and efficient way,” Benner said. “It’s like any other business. You’ve got a pile of inventory that you need to get moving and generate profits.”
William Sherman, the U.S. Drug Enforce-
ment Administration’s acting special agent in charge in San Diego, said drug traffickers may also go on a pre-Christmas smuggling push to give themselves a “little bit of hiatus”during the holidays to visit family in Mexico. 
DEA wiretaps tend to go quiet during the 
holidays, he said.
It’s unclear whether cartels are building 
the tunnels in time for the winter holidays or if that’s when authorities just happen to find them. Some U.S. authorities are inclined to think the cartels are timing construction for the fall harvest, based on their belief that this year’s two major finds in San Diego and one last year in San Diego were discovered shortly after they were completed. Heightened activ-ity around building and operating the tunnels drew suspicion and exposed smugglers to get-ting caught.

Tag, you’re it! Mars Pub and La-
ser Tag is the spot for laser tag in 
Gainesville. With a 3,000-square-foot arena for tag, a variety of beer on tap and the recent addition of subs to its menu, this pub has got it all.
Located at 239 W University Ave., 
the pub is known as a gaming haven. It features Nintendo 64s, classic arcade games, foosball tables, board games and, of course, laser tag. 
Conscious of its location, Mars Pub 
offers a $7 rate per 10-minute laser tag game for students versus the $8 regu-lar rate. 
As of Oct. 27, Mars Pub officially 
began serving food. Owners and UF graduates Melissa Del Valle and Ga-briel Pena have always wanted to serve food. Now they have reached a point where they can. 
“[Serving food] allowed us to open 
earlier than we would have without food, and we can also open later, like after 2 a.m., to serve food to people downtown,” Del Valle said.
But Mars Pub and Laser Tag isn’t 
just for overgrown kids at heart; the pub is kid friendly until 10 p.m., when an age requirement of 18 and older takes effect.  
“We also wanted to give our 
younger customers something else to do while they are here,” she said. “A lot of people didn’t want to have to leave our place to get food. Everyone just likes to eat.”
 The pub doesn’t just serve any 
food. The new menu features more than 20 sub varieties, four of which are completely vegetarian. Besides the large variety, the menu is home to cre-ative names and wallet-friendly prices ranging from $4 to $8.  Names include “Mars Over My Hammy” and “Ma-rio.” Its brother sandwich, the “Luigi,” consists of provolone cheese, salami and capicola.  
Beyond just low sandwich and 
laser-tag prices, Mars strives to keep beer prices low, too. Beer specials are available Tuesday through Friday and include “Three Dollar Thursday” when customers can buy pitchers, tan-kards and pints of any beer on draft for $3, and “TwoCan Tuesday” when one can buy two cans of beer for the price of one.

 He Says…  She Says… He Said, she Said: What’s the deal with online dating?
Dating sites have bad idea 
written all over them. I’ve always seen them as 
nothing more than a relationship-focused Facebook — just another online opportunity to creep on people you will probably never get with.
My main issue with online dat-
ing sites is just that: It’s online. Not to sound old fashioned, but what-ever happened to meeting people in person? 
College life serves up ample 
opportunities to find new people, spend time with them and get to know how they REALLY are.
Skimming a person’s online 
profile (complete with a meticu-lously retouched picture and bom-bastic autobiography) comes no-where close to the real thing.
Selection is another issue with 
dating sites. No offense to those who have tried them, but if you have to go online to find a partner, then you probably aren’t the prize of the dating scene.
Lynzee Marmor, a 20-year-
old journalism junior at UF, said she agrees that college students shouldn’t waste their time on a dating site.
“The best way to meet people 
in college is to socialize in class, at parties, in school clubs and at so-cials,” Marmor said. “Most college students aren’t busy with a career and family responsibilities where they have to resort to online dating to find someone special.”
She makes a good point. Col-
lege should be the easiest time in your life to find everything from a semester crush to a serious soul mate. Let your fears and anxieties go and strike up a conversation with somebody new. You’re only in college once. Make it count. 
— JACOB ROMOSERI have sister who is 37 years old. When she was in college, she met a guy at a frater-nity party who had caught her eye from 
across the room as he played pool with a group of friends. The two ended up talking, hitting it off and dating for the next 10 years. Now, they are happily married and have a daughter who is in the second grade.
OK, great.  But what does this story have 
to do with online dating, you ask?  
Well, nothing really, and that’s the point.  
When my sister was in college, the Internet was an infant, an oddity a la “Weird Sci-ence” that was finding momentum through the nerd networks.  
Fast-forward a few years to find geeks 
and Greeks alike wondering how they ever survived without the Web. We work, bank, shop, watch movies, snag music and attend class online; we may as well use the ‘net for dating too, right?  
The funny thing is online dating remains 
taboo. Hell, I will be the first to admit that I am absolutely humiliated by the fact that, at one point in time, I had an OkCupid.com profile. It only lasted a month, and nothing ever came of it — but I had one nonethe-less. Why is this so difficult to admit? I have friends who have met spouses online, yet even they wish they had a better meeting story than “Her profile was just too cute.”
I realize that I’m being judgmental, but I 
will stand by the position that online dating is just embarrassing. Maybe this is because its mechanism is a showcase of brutal hon-esty. The setup invites millions of people to market themselves as desirable and publish-es this information out into a virtual meat market.  
“Hi, I’m single and looking.”  Only, instead of seeing a congregation at 
a club, one merely has to scroll through a list of photos on prowl for a hottie.  
I get that for some, flirting online is easier 
than face-to-face contact, but I also think that overcoming life’s biggest social challenges brings the most satisfying rewards. Unplug the computer, go outside and spot someone from across the room.

Music artists’ albums aren’t 
supposed to be available to the 
public until their official release dates, but countless CDs are pre-maturely leaked online, avail-able at no cost to anyone with an Internet connection.
Although students are not al-
lowed to engage in file-sharing activity through UF’s Internet networks, it is easier than ever to obtain pirated music. 
“I’m broke,” said Victor Ho, 
20-year-old engineering sopho-more. “I never buy CDs.”
Ho and many other students 
heard Drake’s new album, “Take Care,” before its Nov. 15 release date when it was leaked online. 
“Free” music is so popular 
now that it is rare for a rap or hip-hop artist’s music to not be prematurely released, or leaked on the Web, before its scheduled date.
Although LimeWire is no lon-
ger available for music lovers to use for downloads, there are hundreds of music blogs where fans can directly download mu-sic from their favorite artists for free.
Some artists, like Wale, a rap-
per from Washington, D.C., who performed at UF earlier this year, purposely release free music to their fans on Twitter or Face-book. 
“It’s just the age we grew up 
in,” said Scott Salzman, 19-year-old comptroller of Student Gov-ernment Productions at UF. “Art-ists have switched the revenues that they use to gain their money from. Now it’s more about on-line support, merchandise and shows.”
Salzman said he believes that 
big-time artists don’t necessar -
ily need to make sales from CDs in order to be rich and famous.Students are more likely to show support and appreciation for fa-vorite artists by going to a con-cert or promoting them on social media sites.
“It’s not like how it used to 
be anymore,” he said. “It’s not as traditional as when everyone ran down to Spec’s to pick up an album.”
Aditya Pamidi, co-founder of 
production company Wayward Minds and a UF graduate, said although he thinks CD sales are important, artists’ concert per -
formances generate much more revenue and allow them to reach out to their fans on a more per -
sonal level. He said if an artist is a good performer, he or she could be “very rich.”
“If you do it right, there is 
plenty of money to be made else-where,” he said. “I think college students rarely, if ever, buy mu-sic.”
With cheaper prices for 
shows, more fans can come out, and more money can be made from merchandise sales. 
Unsigned artist Mac Miller, 
who charges about $30 for per -formance tickets, recently had the No. 1 album on iTunes with his album “Blue Slide Park.”
Artists who charge lower 
prices for shows are the ones seeming to stand out on the hip-hop scene, Pamidi said. 
“I think it has proven that 
your live show is way more im-portant than before,” he said. Pamidi said that at the end of the day, the people who buy CDs will still buy CDs, and the people who don’t buy CDs won’t.
“Every single album leaks,” 
he said. “I work very closely with lots of people who love music, and none of them buy CDs.” Check out these stats be-low showcasing sales of leaked albums.

If you didn’t feel like being a part of the 
Black Friday rush, and being trampled after 
eating two pounds of turkey doesn’t sound appealing, we have your fix.  Calling all art-ists, DIY-ers and anyone with an eye for the unique, the GLAM Indie Craft Show is your perfect solution for checking everyone off of your shopping list.
Kim Kruse, GLAM producer, said, “GLAM 
Indie Craft Show is a unique event that pro-vides people with the opportunity to shop from nearly 50 local artists and crafters for unique gifts. We have vendors who will be selling everything from chalkboard T-shirts to bamboo iPad cases and from custom hula hoops to cruelty-free makeup. A lot of our vendors work with up-cycled items to make wallets, sculptures and beautiful jewelry . We even have a vendor who’ll be offering pet products.”
Up-crafted items are old crafts that are re-
cycled into new crafts.
The show is not only for the experienced 
craft shopper but for anyone interested in crafting.  If “arts and crafts” is not your forte, tasty treats will be for sale.  For the interior designer, there will be many art pieces on sale that could add interesting decor to any dorm or apartment.  
“Whether you’re a beginning artist or 
someone who has been creating for years, you’ll definitely appreciate the range of items that are offered at GLAM,” Kruse said. “We even have one guy who turns old silverware into sculptures that you can put in your house or your garden. He makes crawfish, honey-bees — you name it.”  
If you are really into completing a holiday 
shopping list, the show includes, but isn’t lim-
ited to, custom T-shirts, calendars, buttons, handmade soaps, beauty products, jewelry and homemade dog biscuits.  The show fea-tures vendors that offer unique pieces that are not necessarily mass-produced or found in chain stores.  
“Only vendors who fit with the overall vibe 
of the show are admitted,” Kruse said. “We work really hard to make sure that GLAM is an event that offers unique items that will ap-peal to folks who like things that are a little off the beaten path.”
For the college student on a budget, there 
are vendors who will offer items less than $20.  Since all are homemade, the vendors pride themselves on keeping the products unique and affordable.  
What’s the best you can get out of the 
show?  
“My main goal with the show is to provide 
a place for emerging artists and crafters to have a place to showcase their work but also to provide all of the cool people in Gainesville with a place where they can shop for the kinds of gifts that they really want to buy ,” Kruse said. “I think it’s a great experience to buy things directly from the person who actually makes them. It makes you feel like you’re re-ally making a difference in your own commu-nity.”
For more information on the show and for 
a full list of vendors, visit glamcraftshow.com. GLAM Indie Craft Show features 50 local artists, quirky pieces

UF forward Erik Murphy’s knee injury is not as severe as the team originally thought. The 
junior will miss Friday’s game at Syracuse, but could return against Arizona next week.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
After tests during the Thanksgiving holiday 
revealed Erik Murphy had a torn meniscus, the 
Gators were grateful to learn this week their start-ing forward’s knee injury was not as severe as origi-nally thought.
Coach Billy Donovan said the swelling in Mur -
phy’s right knee is due to a bone bruise. The tear that showed up in an MRI and X-rays on Saturday was from a prior injury Murphy suffered as a soph-omore in high school.
When Murphy was 16, his doctor decided he 
didn’t need surgery to repair the torn cartilage. The confusion over the state of his current injury ended early this week once Florida’s doctors received the old test results from Jay Murphy, Erik’s father, and compared them with the most recent tests. 
“Erik’s dad [and the doctors] 
did a really good job of putting their heads together and trying to gather all of the information be-fore they made any decision be-cause it was during Thanksgiving when this happened,” Donovan said.  “At least right now, every-
body is on the same page in terms 
of what they’re doing rehab-wise. And then we’ll see how he responds the next couple days.”
Donovan said Murphy will not have to undergo 
surgery and that it should take him 10-14 days to recover from his injury. Wednesday was Day 7.
While Murphy will not play at No. 4 Syracuse (7-
0) on Friday, Donovan could see him being ready to play when No. 10 Florida (5-1) hosts Arizona (5-2) next Wednesday.
“He actually can get back to doing as much as 
he’s capable of withstanding, so I don’t know if he’ll be back to full practice right away, but defi-nitely he’ll be put in a situation where he’s getting a chance to run, move laterally, shoot, all of those kind of things,” Donovan said.
Murphy missed Florida’s last two wins against Forward Murphy will not require surgery on knee
� UF SHOOTING 41.3 PER-
CENT FROM BEYOND ARC IN LAST THREE GAMES.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
 
Beyond the arc has been 
a dark place at times for the 
Gators this season.
Florida struggled in its first 
four games, shooting just 21.9 percent from 3-point range. However, in the last three games, the Gators have made 19 of 46 threes, spearheaded by senior guard Jordan Jones’ 8-of-21 clip.
“Our mindset is always, ‘Get 
the ball inside and that’s even-tually going to open up easy shots from the outside,’” Jones said.
Senior guard Lanita Bartley 
has played a role in Florida’s in-creased shooting success.
She has made 4 of 6 attempts

“That makes us really tough 
to guard when one of our best penetrators  is also knocking down shots behind the arc,” coach Amanda Butler said.
The Gators (6-1) started off 
the season aggressive from the 3-point line. Florida took 27 threes in a 69-66 season-open-ing loss to Michigan, converting on 10 of those attempts.
But sophomore guard Jater -

In the following wins against

The RALLY
Tyler: Picking apart Flor-
ida’s faults is like choos-ing the biggest tool during 
rush week: There are almost too many options.
“You can’t just put your finger 
on one thing and say , ‘This is it,’” 
Muschamp said, not referring to frat bros.
Yes, the Gators had plenty of 
problems this year. But, more than anything, they need to upgrade their running game if they want to improve in 2012.
Florida ranks 75th in the nation 
in rushing yards per game with 144, a number that isn’t terrible on the sur -
face. But a g a i n s t the coun-try’s best teams, and even some downright a v e r a g e ones, the Gators couldn’t run the ball when it mattered: UF averaged just 61.8 yards per game in its six losses.
Matt: Sure, sure, Florida’s run-
ning game was bad at times, but it wasn’t the biggest problem the team faced. In four 
of the six games the Gators lost, they had a chance to win only to blow it away with turn-overs. 
At minus-11, UF ranked 114th 
out of 120 BCS teams in turnover margin. That’s not just bad, it’s abysmal. And although Mus-champ said you can’t put your finger on one thing, there’s one stat he pointed to before the season as most important: turnovers. 
In six wins, the Gators post-
ed a margin of plus-1. In six losses, they were minus-12.  That issue was never more glar -
ing than in the final game of the season, when Florida’s defense held Florida State to less than 100 yards of offense but lost the game because of four interceptions. 
Tyler: Muschamp actually 
pointed out two stats as being key: turnovers and explosive plays. Florida only busted 60 runs longer than 10 yards, which ranks 51st in the country . With running backs 
What is UF’s biggest problem going into ‘12?

When Florida takes the court Friday night to begin 
the NCAA tournament, it will be thrown into a sce-
nario equal parts familiar and different. 
In one light, it will be the Gators’ 21st consecutive 
appearance in college volleyball’s December tradi-tion. However, for just the second time in those 21 years, No. 17 Florida’s players will look around and see strange surroundings. 
Replacing the comfortable confines of the 
O’Connell Center will be the McLeod Center, the 6,750-seat home of the Northern Iowa Panthers. 
“We’re ready to show people that we should have 
been here at home first,” sophomore setter Chanel Brown said. “We do have a little chip on our shoulder that we’re not here (at home).”
For just the second time under Wise, the Gators 
were not awarded one of the 16 seeds the NCAA tournament offers, meaning both a road setting for the first two rounds and difficult early-round match-ups. 
In order to make it back to Gainesville for the 
NCAA Regionals, Florida will have to get past Mis-souri, which went 21-12 in the tough Big 12 Con-ference, as well as a probable matchup with No. 12 Northern Iowa. 
“Easily one of the toughest opponents we’ve ever 
had in the first round,” UF coach Mary Wise said of Missouri. “We’ll be in a huge battle just to get out of the first round. One of the toughest matches we’ll play all year will be in the first round of the NCAA tournament.”
Five seniors will be faced with the tall task of 
making sure their Florida careers don’t end in Cedar Falls, Iowa.
“It’s maybe an advantage,” senior outside hitter 
Kristy Jaeckel said. “Maybe you can get a little bit comfortable when you’re home. Going on the road, you know you have to have that warrior mentality.”
After touting her team’s résumé after the Gators’ 
regular-season finale, Wise was perplexed Sunday night when the selection committee’s decisions were announced. 
Southern California, the nation’s No. 1 team in the 
American Volleyball Coaches Association Poll, war -
ranted just a No. 7 seed in the tournament. Florida State, which was swept by Florida on Aug. 30 and has one more loss than UF does this season, was awarded the No. 12 seed. Northern Iowa, which was ranked No. 12 in the final polls, was given the No. 6 seed.
But it was how Southeastern Conference champi-
on Tennessee, the No. 14 seed, got treated that irked Wise the most.
“The committee didn’t give a whole lot of love 
to the SEC — that was pretty obvious,” Wise said. “There are a couple head-scratchers there, but those are things we’re not going to think about right now. All attention is on Missouri.”Unseeded Florida has chip on shoulder entering tournament 
David Carr / Alligator
UF coach Mary Wise and the Gators volleyball team are unseeded in 
the NCAA tournament for just the second time in 21 years.  
built on breakaway speed and noth-
ing else, that performance is not good enough.
Florida needed more long runs, be-
cause it wasn’t getting anything else. Florida’s top-three rushers weigh an average of 187.7 pounds. Look at the best two running teams in the country , Alabama and LSU, teams Muschamp dreams of having. The Crimson Tide’s top-three backs average 230 pounds. The Tigers’ runners average 217.7.
On Saturday , Demps finished with 
negative-8 yards on four carries, each time ignoring a running lane up the mid-dle while trying to bounce outside. At-tention running back recruits Mike Da-vis and Matt Jones, both of whom weigh 200 pounds: Expect to make the weight room and the dining hall your second and third homes when you arrive.
Matt: In the long run, explosive plays 
aren’t as big a factor in losing games as turnovers, and there’s no denying it. 
In losses to Auburn, Georgia and 
Florida State — games the Gators aver -
aged 33.6 yards rushing — Florida would have won each time had it not turned the ball over in pivotal moments.
Against the Tigers, the first touch-
down and the clinching field goal were both set up by muffed punts. Against Georgia, the Bulldogs scored 14 points off Gators turnovers. 
And you already know that Florida 
State didn’t stand a chance if John Brant-ley and Jacoby Brissett didn’t throw the game away . Whether the team has big backs next 
season doesn’t matter nearly as much if it continues to give the ball away . 
As Muschamp so eloquently put it: 
“Fumbles? They aren’t good.”
The defense also shares some cul-
pability here, as that unit forced just 12 takeaways this season, which ranked 113th in the nation. West Virginia and USC are the only two ranked teams out-side the top 80 in takeaways. 
If you give the ball away , and can’t 
take it back, little else matters. Football is about the ball, after all. 
Tyler: But if you can control the line 
of scrimmage, you will win almost ev-ery time. Florida’s inability to run was highlighted in short-yardage situations. When the Gators needed 3 yards or less on third downs this year, they converted only 51 percent of the time. Tim Tebow isn’t walking through those doors.
On Saturday , Florida converted one 
of three short-yardage third downs. In a game when points were at a premium, the Gators were especially hurt in the second quarter when they couldn’t move the chains at the FSU 15-yard line.
On third and 1, Hunter Joyer was 
stuffed up the middle. On fourth and 1, Trey Burton somehow managed to lose 14 yards on a quarterback sneak in what can only be described as the worst col-lege football play of all time.
Matt: And after all of that, after all 
the embarrassing plays, the lack of a run game or a receiver of note, Florida still would have won the game if they didn’t turn the ball over. It’s really that simple.

Alligator StaffWith Murphy out, Gators will depend on Yeguete’s rebounding
Jacksonville and Stetson, but he 
was walking without crutches on Wednesday.
In his first four games as a regu-
lar starter, Murphy averaged 10 points and four rebounds. While he is shooting 57 percent from three, it is the 6-foot-10 Murphy’s length that will be needed most against the Orange this week.
Syracuse boasts two starting big 
men in 6-foot-9 Rakeem Christmas and 7-foot Fab Melo. Without Mur -
phy, the Gators have relied heavily on 6-foot-7 forward Will Yeguete to help carry the rebounding load along with center Patric Young.Yeguete, a sophomore, played 
a career-high 26 minutes and had his first double-double Monday against Stetson with 10 points and a game-high 11 rebounds.
“This will be a different kind of 
challenge because, one, we played in Columbus against a top-five team with Erik,” Donovan said. “Frontcourt-wise we had some-body that can deal with (Ohio State forward Deshaun) Thomas. This is a little bit different with Fab Melo and Rakeem Christmas. … So even when we’ve played some four-guard lineups, this will be the first time we will have faced a team with this kind of length being a little bit limited size-wise across our front line.”

percent beyond the arc this season on 23 attempts.
Needles has surgery on left knee
The Gators attempted just 
three shots from beyond the 
arc in the second half after struggling to convert on seven long-range opportunities in the first 20 minutes.
“My shot feels really good,” 
said sophomore forward Lily Svete, who is 2-of-11 from be-yond the arc this season. “I’m just trying to stay confident because I feel like it’s going to go in, so I guess I’m doing all I can do.”
Florida’s recent surge from 
3-point range will need to con-tinue if it wants to pull its sec-ond upset of a ranked oppo-nent this season against No. 11 Rutgers (6-0) when the teams play tomorrow at 8 in Daytona Beach.
“None of us ever doubted 
that our threes were going to fall,” Butler said. “I give them credit for not hitting the panic button when those shots weren’t falling.”
