Brittany Lee first took her dog, Griffin, to Bruce Bab-
er’s Mydogspace in May 2009. 
Over the course of the year, Baber regularly saw 
that Griffin and other dogs enlisted in his care were 
fed, walked two to three times per day and were free to roam.
On June 23, Griffin and the 63-year-old Baber will 
likely see each other for the last time.
Due to a city code violation, the dog-sitting service, 
based out of Baber’s home at 1713 NW 7th Ave., will be forced to close down. 
Baber, who started the business in 2006, said he was 
extremely disappointed by the news.
“It’s like having your legs knocked out from under 
you,” he said. “It’s been very hard on me. But I’m keep-ing a positive attitude as best I can. I’m gonna focus all my energy on resolving it as long as I can, even after the dogs are gone.”
Baber was first approached by a code enforcement 
officer in April. He was told that running a business out of his home violates Gainesville city code. He was also told he would have to apply for a permit to continue Dog-sitting

Florida wide receiver Frankie Ham-
mond Jr. was arrested on campus early 
Sunday and charged with DUI and under-
age possession of alcohol after his beige Mercury sedan was stopped for speeding.
Shortly after 2 a.m., University Po-
lice Department officer Samuel Delucca 
clocked Hammond’s vehicle going about 
45 miles per hour while headed south on Gale Lemerand Drive, where the speed limit is 20 mph.
Along with speeding, Delucca said he noticed Hammond’s vehicle swerving down the road.
After Delucca stopped 
the sedan at the commut-er lot on Gale Lemerand Drive, he said Hammond’s 
eyes were “glassy and bloodshot,” accord-
ing to the police report, and his speech was “slurred and he appeared to be unco-
ordinated.” 
The report said Delucca sensed alcohol 
on Hammond’s breath and asked him to step out of the vehicle where Delucca ad-ministered field sobriety tests.
Hammond failed the sobriety tests and

The bars are fighting back.
The Swamp Restaurant, 101 
Cantina and Rum Runners (for-merly Fat Tuesday) are appealing recent court decisions that would 
prohibit them from serving those 
under 21 after 9 p.m. 
Under a city ordinance de-
signed to curb underage drinking, bars and restaurants that incur a 
certain number of infractions each 
business quarter are subject to the prohibition. Venues with a capac-ity under 201 can have up to five 
offenses per quarter, while larger 
venues can have 10, according to attorney Elizabeth Waratuke, who is representing the city in these ap-peals.
Subsequent infractions incur 
longer prohibition periods. A first offense gets 90 days, second-time offenders get 180, and a third strike 
makes a venue 21 and up for a full 
year, Waratuke said.
101 Cantina’s appeal hearing 
was rescheduled from Monday to July 1, the Swamp for July 20, and 
Rum Runners for July 22.
Employees at 101 Cantina are not commenting on the restau-
rant’s numerous infractions. The 
small venue faces the harshest 
penalty, having surpassed the limit three quarters in a row, with 56 incidents since the beginning of this year, according to Gainesville 
police statistics.Gator WR charged with DUI on campus

Collier County on $3,000 bond. It is unclear if Belmore has an attorney.
  According to deputies, a

FHP: Boy caused fatal bi-
cycle crash at Disney 
 LAKE BUENA VISTA — In-
vestigators have found that a 
9-year-old boy killed in a colli-
sion with a Walt Disney World 
bus while riding his bicycle was “solely responsible” for the ac-cident.
  The Florida Highway Patrol 
report released Monday shows Chase Brubaker’s bicycle also had a ﬂ  at rear tire and an un-der-inﬂ  ated front tire that could 
have contributed to the April 1 
crash. 
FHP says bus driver David 
Rich was not at fault, and no 
charges will be ﬁ  led.
  The report shows that bus 
was traveling in the same di-
rection as Brubaker when he crossed into the road and hit the middle of the bus. He was 
pulled under the right rear tire.
  Brubaker was riding with 
an 11-year-old girl at the time. She was not injured. Both were 
wearing helmets.
  FHP says its investigation is 
complete.

� A SIGNED TIM TEBOW JERSEY SOLD FOR 
$800. SHELLEY MEYER CO-HOSTED THE EVENT.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
Nearly 400 people ate for charity Sunday night at the 
Hilton UF Conference Center.
Taste of Home, a charity event hosted by Home: Living 
in the Heart of Florida magazine, brought food, auctions 
and music to the Hilton.
Tickets cost $75.Money from the fundraiser went to three children’s 
charities: Child Advocacy Center, Children’s Home So-ciety of Florida and Leadership Gainesville. Leadership Gainesville will donate its portion to the Take Stock in Children program, March of Dimes and Girls to Young 
Ladies.
The donated food came from about 25 local restau-
rants, according to Emily Davis, public relations director 
for the magazine’s publishing company.
Shelley Meyer, wife of UF football coach Urban Meyer, 
and Lewis Stokes, a disc jockey for 93.7 K Country radio, hosted the event.
Of the more than 175 silent auction items, all but four 
were bid on, according to Scott Costello, the owner and 
publisher of Home magazine.
The first item in the live auction, a framed, autographed 
Tim Tebow Gator jersey, was valued at about $1,450, and 
went for $800.
This year, although Costello hasn’t finished counting 
proceeds from the auction, his plan is to donate $10,000 to each of the three charities.
“When I talked to people, they were shocked this was 
a first-year event,” he said. “People were happy with the 
results. They want to participate next year.”Celeste Rubanick, a volunteer for the Children’s Home 
Society, said she donates her time to the event so she can 
do something for the community.
“I don’t have money to donate,” she said, “so I donate 
time.”
Next year, Costello said he wants the event to run more efficiently and have more sponsors and donations. 
He also said he wants to double the size of next year’s 
event.
The fundraiser received about $60,000 in donations 
prior to the event, and could not have run without do-nated services, he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 15, 2010

101 Cantina, The Swamp, Rum Runners violated the city ordinance
“We kind of feel like we’re being singled 
out,” said Swamp manager Brian Behling. 
The Swamp is facing a 180-day prohibi-
tion after surpassing the limit twice since 
January. He said police often stop by without 
warning and arrest employees for things like not using mechanical customer counters. 
“To me, it feels like the city’s hurting for 
money,” he said. “So they’re going after 
small businesses for petty things.”
Behling said the prohibition, if effected, would hurt the Swamp’s business because it 
caters mostly to the student population. He 
said not allowing young-er patrons would force the restaurant to raise 
prices.
Behling said the Swamp is doing every-thing it can to make sure the number of un-
derage drinking infractions stays below the ordinance level.
“I’m constantly walking through the 
crowd,” Behling said. “We’re hiring more 
security staff. We’re really tightening the 
screws.”UNDERAGE , from page 1

If you build it, they will come. At least 
that’s UF’s intent for the Florida Innovation 
Hub.
About 250 people attended the ground-
breaking ceremony on Monday afternoon 
for the 45,000-square-foot building that will 
contain space for UF startup technology 
companies.
The facility, scheduled to be completed by fall 2011, will be located on the corner of 
Southwest Second Avenue and Southwest Seventh Terrace.
The project was funded in part by an $8.2 
million grant from the federal Economic De-velopment Administration. UF gave another $5 million, according to a press release.
Officials expect programs and activities 
at the Florida Innovation Hub to bring to-gether entrepreneurs, investors, students and service providers to commercialize more UF research.“The hub will serve as a catalyst to get 
innovation from university laboratories into 
the marketplace, where it 
can have an impact on the 
world while creating jobs in Florida,” UF President Bernie Machen said.
The architecture of the 
hub will allow the build-ing to serve as a meeting place between downtown 
Gainesville and UF’s campus,  Machen said. The facility will provide office space, labo-ratories, conference rooms and will house the main commercialization offices for the 
university.
According to Gainesville Mayor Craig 
Lowe, the facility is sensible because it cre-
ates a meeting place with all of the capabili-ties that the hub will have.
“What can we do to bring the university 
and the community closer together?” Lowe said. “This project, this innovation hub, is the answer.”

Pepsi could help a UF professor 
cure herpes.
David C. Bloom, a professor in 
the department of molecular genet-
ics and microbiology, is competing 
in the Pepsi Refresh Project for a $50,000 grant to fund a treatment for 
herpes.
Bloom and his research team 
invented a new ribozyme therapy that could be used to treat herpes 
infections that are resistant to con-
ventional drug treatments. The ri-bozyme, a molecule in genetic ma-terial, is intended to make the virus lose its ability to infect and be trans-mitted to others. 
About 1 million new cases of herpes occur annually, according to Bloom’s page on the Pepsi Refresh Project’s website. 
If Bloom gets the grant and his 
experiments suc-
ceed, he would 
be able to stop the recurrence of her-
pes and fund human clinical trials for the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).
“Our project is at a critical phase right now,” Bloom said. “We have exciting data that shows our therapy can block the HSV infection in vivo, but we need additional data on the ability of this treatment to block re-
current disease.” 
The grant could help Bloom com-
plete his studies. If the experiments 
are successful, Bloom and his team will be able to apply for more fund-ing from the National Institutes of Health to begin human clinical tri-als. 
“We are trying to get as many 
people to vote for this project each day as possible,” Bloom said. 
Bloom’s team is currently ranked 
as No. 25 on the project’s website. He will win the $50,000 prize if he’s voted into the project’s top 10.
Voting will end June 30. Voters can register and vote for

Today’s question: Do you wear sunscreen regularly?Thursday’s question: Have you ever been on a cross-country road trip?49% YES51% NO
102 TOTAL VOTESAnother UF football player was arrested and charged 
with a DUI and liquor possession early Sunday 
morning. Go Gators.
Frankie Hammond Jr., a 20-year-old wide receiver for the 
Gators, was pulled over on campus for going 45 miles per 
hour in a 20-mph zone. A field sobriety test put him at more 
than double the legal limit of 0.08. He had two empty 750-ml 
bottles of Crown Royal in his car.
When will our football players realize that when they 
drink and drive, we all lose? When Carlos Dunlap was ar-
rested on DUI charges last year, it was a major factor in our loss against Alabama in the SEC championship game. With-
out our key players on the field we cannot be expected to 
be champions, so instead of suspending players for getting 
DUIs, the coaches at Ben Hill Griffin should consider alterna-
tive punishments.
We propose that from now on any football player who is 
arrested on alcohol charges should have to be a starter at a 12:30 p.m. game with no less than a fifth of whiskey coursing 
through his veins. 
Any player who thinks he can drive a car after a few 
drinks should not have a problem catching a football or two 
in 90 degree weather on a Saturday afternoon.
To be fair, not letting a player play in a game is a pretty big 
punishment, but it only prevents repeat problems because it 
is a simple form of negative reinforcement. Players, and non-campus celebrities too, need to realize that driving drunk is 
wrong not just because it is illegal, but because when you 
drive under the influence you are not physically capable of driving safely.Football Fail

Guest column
My friend and I ventured to one of those notorious 
apartment pool parties last Saturday. We’re not ex-actly regulars, but we wanted to check out the fes-
tivities and meet new people. As soon as we arrived, a guy gravitated toward — our sunscreen. Before even introducing 
himself, he asked to borrow the spray-on sunscreen we were 
covering ourselves with.
“You’re the first girls I’ve found here with an SPF of more 
than five,” he said with relief as he slathered his sun-baked chest in a liquid UV-shield. “Everyone I asked had tanning oil.” This clearly wasn’t a pick-up line. He was desperate for some sunscreen. It made me laugh to realize what a rare find it was at a summer pool party. The two seem to go hand in hand to me. At least they always did when I was growing 
up.
Remember the days when your mom would bring a vat of 
viscous, white sun lotion to the pool and make you hold off 
on your cannonball until she finished wiping thick layers of paste onto your face and shoulders? A lot goes wrong when moms aren’t there anymore to keep their kids in order.
The sunscreen scavenger offered my of-age friend a whis-
key ginger in gratitude for the apparently rare and highly coveted source of skin salvation, which she gladly accepted. 
That’s a pretty decent trade, I said, although sunscreen is 
probably more expensive per ounce than alcohol. So what’s with the sunscreen shortage? No one had forgotten sunglass-es, towels or 64-ounce beverage cups, so I’m guessing no one forgot sunscreen or accidentally grabbed tanning oil.
I suppose price is a major turnoff for sunscreen – it rings in 
at about $8 a bottle depending on the brand. But that would be an easy purchase for many college kids if it was a bottle of alcohol. And GatorWell gives out free packets all year. 
We all know the answer rests in vanity. Some people think 
they look better tan, so they seek an instant tan. Not only do they avoid sunscreen, they baste in tanning oil to make them darken quicker. 
But ironically, if you were really concerned about your looks, you would use sunscreen. Because afternoons drenched in frying oil leads to wrinkles and sun spots and dry, scaly skin that 
no one wants to sport in their 30s and 40s. And pretty soon 
people will look at you and guess you are 10 or 15 years older 
than you are. 
While I’ll admit there is something attractive about hav-
ing a bit of a sun-kissed, golden glow, I find it gross to see someone’s crackling red skin flaking off onto the lounge chair next to me, exposing a tender layer of ghostly white. And certain shades of orange just don’t look natural. It’s healthy to catch some rays and get a nice dose of Vitamin D, but I’ve never had a problem achieving either of those things 
with sunscreen on. People have this misperception that you 
can’t tan if you wear sunscreen. You can tan, you just don’t bake and boil as quickly. And when you’re 20 shades into the red spectrum on the color wheel, I can’t help but look at you and think of a crispy lobster. It’s only June. If you haven’t achieved your desired tan yet, you have plenty of time to left to acquire some healthy color. And I believe pale is gorgeous too. Look at Anne Hathaway, Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, James Franco, Cory Monteith from “Glee,” and 
all those vampires in the movies.
If only there were as much sunscreen at pool parties as 
there was alcohol. Then our new acquaintance might have 
saved himself a couple shades of burn before we arrived to the rescue. Did I mention that skin cancer is the most com-mon cancer in the U.S.? One in five Americans will get it, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.
So, for the price of a few beers, go buy yourself a bottle 
of the good stuff and let your skin drink in some protection 
from cancer, wrinkles, peeling and sunspots. You don’t want 
to be scrounging for sunblock after your skin has already started to burn, and you could attract some hottie who offers you a drink if you lend him your block.

Speaking OutThe Good Class?
Of the many topics cov-
ered at UF’s Board of Trustees meeting last 
week, the one that piqued our interest was a class called “The Good Life.”
The class was tested on 
a group of students in the 
spring, and if things go well 
enough UF hopes to massive-ly expand enrollment in the 
course. According to Provost 
Joe Glover, this class will give incoming freshmen a chance to bond over coursework in-
stead of off-campus activities 
or university athletics.
While the intentions seem 
pure enough, we wonder how the bond between two 
students who take an easy 
class together would be any stronger than a friendship de-veloped by any other means. 
When we look back on our 
first  year at UF, we try not to remember the awkward group assignments and the people we hung around with while we were still adjusting to being college students—
opting instead to  remember 
the fun things we did with friends outside of class.
Changing up the entire 
UF experience seems to be 
en vogue these days, but we 
hope that when we come back to campus for tailgates every 
fall we will not be greeted by 
some bizarro-world Student Body that really enjoys go-ing to class together every 
day. That would just be too 
weird.
We would like to know 
what UF’s idea of the “good life” is, though the more we 
think about it, the more we’re

Pro-life reader responds to Gov. Crist’s 
veto of House Bill 1143.
As a realistic pro-life Catholic, I expect-
ed Gov. Charlie Crist’s veto. Regardless of 
the throngs of national callers, obviously 
he’d opt for the majority opinion of Flor-
ida residents.
This effort now seems to meet the defi-
nition of insanity. Not for Crist, but for 
pro-lifers. 
Same tactics, same failed outcome as 
before. I’ve suggested to many Catholic 
parishes and groups that we break out of the broken mold, but to no avail. 
Perhaps if we first wholeheartedly ad-
vocate for those guilty of horrors against humanity on Death Row (and as we know there are innocents there too, 27 plus Flor-
ida exonerees thus far) maybe then society 
would seriously consider our concern for the pre-born.

� � �Writer used ad hominem attacks in 
retort to Griffin’s column.
It is a sign of intellectual vacuity when 
a writer has to resort to ad hominem at-tacks. 
This is what Frederic Spieler did when he 
wrote “Conservative Arguments In Grif-fin’s Column Not True.”  He goes so far as to wish Bryan Griffin ill 
in his job prospects once he completes his 
graduate studies.  What’s next, hoping Griffin’s mother gets hit by the cross-town bus?
He also uses a common vulgarity in his 
attempt to summarize Griffin’s column. Spieler’s tone is hostile because his sub-stance is weak.  He admits ignorance of what happened with the Spikedance fish 
in Arizona, an example which illustrates 
the unintended consequences and self-de-feating effects of so many environmental regulations.
Spieler claims conventional light bulbs 
release more mercury than CFL bulbs. (They don’t. The claim is that power plants release mercury.) You’ve been liv-ing around conventional light bulbs all your life.  Are you suffering from mer-cury poisoning? Of course not. But drop a 
CFL bulb and now you’ve got a mercury 
spill right at your feet. Good luck with the cleanup.
Spieler’s tone is argumentative, but in 
terms of real arguments he ends up con-
ceding  much to Griffin.  Towards the end 
of his column,
Spieler admits it’s a debatable question 
as to whether environmental restrictions 
hurt the poor in the Third World. And in 
his last paragraph he admits “there are actual flaws with liberalism as well as our government.” Which was Bryan Griffin’s point all along. Score one for Griffin, zip 
for Spieler.

Responsible reporting carries the weight

One gram of JWH018 is dissolved in 1

Government should handle alcohol and 
marijuana the same way.
Our government’s attempt to prevent 
people from getting high is a dangerous 
and futile exercise. 
Americans got the message on alcohol, 
and some day we will get the message on marijuana also.
Alan Martin

The Board of Trustees did its job. Instructed by 
President Machen to (as quoted in the Alligator) “wrassle” with the new student fees, the board did 
just that. What is “wrassle,” you say? 
According to Urban Dictionary, “wrassle” is one of three 
things (though the first I find out of context in this scenario): 
1. To wrestle in a sexual way; 2. To nail or hammer down; to get done or to smack down; and (my personal favorite) 3. To wrestle your opponent into submission and penetrate his/her colon with the thumb of your free hand.
Now, I understand if the president was referring to 
wrestling with the new fee, i.e., considering, debating, 
having deep thought over. But wrestling it into submis-
sion? I’ve only been studying political science for three years, but that doesn’t sound like a characteristic of de-mocracy to me. 
It begs the question: Is UF a representative democracy 
or simply a tyrannical autocracy? Or is it an oligarchy run by the Board of Trustees? I understand that in every gov-ernment, coercion is usually implemented to get things done. And I also understand that money makes the world 
go ‘round, and we’re in a budget crisis, and SG money 
doesn’t grow on trees, and students like cushy services.But what happens when the rep-
resentatives elected by 25 percent of the Student Body, including our Stu-
dent Body president, disagree with 
the severity of the new fees, and the Board of Trustees 
passes them all anyway? If we are truly in control of our government we should have a mechanism for relief. 
America has the court system, the right to peacefully 
assemble and the right to petition our government. The UF equivalent would be the legislature (SG) passing a bill, the president (Bernie Machen) vetoing it, and the Su-preme Court (Board of Trustees) writing and passing a 
new bill regardless of what the people say. Definitely not 
democratic or very polite.
There is a term in economics for the price fluctuation 
of goods and services. It’s either an elastic or inelastic 
demand, the latter meaning that, regardless of the price, 
people will still pay it because they have to, like the cost of a life-saving drug. 
Apparently, we here at UF are facing an inelastic 
demand when it comes to student fees. The number of 
courses we take determines the price we pay in fees—
which is, in itself, an irony, because a larger course load makes someone less likely to have free time to be spent on services provided by student fees. 
Our only other option is to transfer, drop out or take 
fewer courses. Taking fewer courses means spending more on living expenses and tuition during the extra years tacked onto undergrad. 
If I were an administrator, I would hope for the quick-
est turnaround rate possible—get the freshmen in, get them out in four years or less and move on to bigger and better things. But then again, I’m not an administrator.
I’m not saying there isn’t a need for increased student 
fees. But isn’t passing it without student approval akin to 
forcibly “wrassling” us to the ground until we pay up? 
What’s the point of parading around as a democracy if 
the important decisions are left to an independent board? 
I would just as rather be told up front what I was deal-
ing with, because if it looks like a dictator, smells like a 
dictator, acts like a dictator...well, my bet is on it being a dictator. But that’s just me.
A final word to the administration: Go easy on our co-
lons. Please.

 In December, in the midst of Alexia’s ﬁ  fth year as a UF 
botany student, it was ﬁ  nally time to begin peeling off every layer that made her a man. 
  “It was like an itch I couldn’t scratch,” she said, at-
tempting to describe what it felt like growing up as a boy when she so strongly felt like a girl. 
  One pill of estrogen and one pill of testosterone sup-
pressant every morning and evening, several laser hair-removal treatments and an entirely new closet slowly take her closer to what she is meant to be: a woman.
  Life is much better now, and she is ﬁ  lled with hope and 
excitement for her future at Oregon State University.

  Clockwise from top:   Alexia started her sex transformation in December; Alexia quickly puts on some mascara before she rushes 
out to class; Thinking of her chest as a part of her body that has to be covered all the time in public is still a relatively new concept for her;     Spending time with a friend to pick the right outﬁ  t before a night out is one of Alexia’s new-found joys;           Before leaving for a concert, Alexia takes a few minutes in her apartment to settle in her new dress.

UF ADMINISTRATION

UF’s Board of Trustees met Thursday and 
Friday to make several changes for next year.
Among the topics were faculty raises, a com-
mon freshman course and enrollment.
“Nobody else in this economy is thinking 
of raises, and if they are, they’re very small,” 
said Mary Ann Ferguson, Faculty Senate chair-
woman.
UF President Bernie Machen’s announce-
ment to raise faculty and staff’s pay is a sign of 
great leadership, Ferguson said.
The raises will increase faculty salaries up 
to 4 percent and staff salaries up to 3 percent based on performance. 
Performance evaluations will be determined 
by department chairs, UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando said. 
Graduate assistants’ pay will increase 3 per-
cent, regardless of performance, and minimum 
wages for some UF jobs will increase from $9.02 
per hour to $9.75 per hour.
The raises were made possible by the fed-
eral stimulus package, Orlando said. However, 
increased tuition will help cover the slack after stimulus money runs out.
Provost Joe Glover also outlined a plan to 
encourage a common, in-class experience for incoming freshmen through a new course. 
Honors students had the chance to take the hu-
manities course, tentatively titled “The Good Life,” in the spring semester. 
In the board meeting’s agenda, the course 
was described as reading and writing inten-sive.
Glover said the course is important because 
students identify with UF’s athletics and out-of-classroom activities, and he is concerned that they aren’t connecting with the university 
in the classroom. 
The course, which will have three sections 
under the tag IDH3931, is also intended to be 
interdisciplinary, which means course objec-tives will apply to all majors
The university expects 600 freshmen to take 
the course in the fall. If it is successful, then Glover said the university plans to “scale it up to a huge proportion of the freshman class.”
The course, however, will not be required.Glover also wants to stabilize declining en-
rollment levels.
Glover’s plan is to raise graduate enroll-
ment between half a percent and 1 percent each 
year.
“We are probably at, or 
near, capacity at the univer-sity,” he said. “If our four-year 
graduation rate went up, then 
we could increase our fresh-
man and transfer classes.”
Student Body President 
Ashton Charles said she thinks 
the board needs to respect the educational paths of all students, even those who take longer than four years.
“Some degrees do take longer to achieve,” 
she said.
Additionally, Machen wants undergradu-
ate recruitment to focus more on out-of-state prospects. While the university enrolls many international students at the graduate level, 93 
percent of undergraduates are from Florida.
Already, the university has begun sending 
advisers to interested students in the Washing-
ton, D.C. and New York areas, Glover said.
“[Alumni] have children who want to come 
back to the University of Florida,” Glover said.Machen raises faculty pay

UF wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. fights for extra yardage after catching a pass from John Brantley 
against Charleston Southern in 2009. Hammond was arrested early Sunday morning on campus.
Police found two bottles of 
whiskey in Hammond’s car
was subsequently arrested for 
DUI.
Police found two open 750-ml 
bottles of Crown Royal whiskey 
in Hammond’s vehicle — one in 
the back seat and the other in the 
trunk. 
According to the report pro-
vided by UPD, one bottle was 
about one quarter full and the other was less than a quarter full. 
Hammond, 20, was arrested 
and taken to the UPD police sta-tion where another officer col-lected breath samples with Ham-
mond’s consent. 
According to the report, Ham-
mond blew a .188 and a .191, 
making his blood-alcohol content more than twice the legal limit of .08.
According to team spokesman 
Steve McClain, Hammond, who 
will be a red-shirt sophomore 
in the fall, has been suspended 
from all team 
activities.
After catch-
ing just four 
passes for 57 
yards and a 
touchdown last season, Ham-mond was expected to play a larger role in the Gators’ re-
vamped receiving corps headed 
into the 2010 season.
The arrest is at least the 28th for a 
UF football player during coach Ur-
ban Meyer’s tenure at Florida.DUI , from page 1
City code would need to be amended for dog service to remain open
running his service. 
He applied for a permit the next day. One 
month later, city officials denied him a permit 
due to another code violation: Baber was keep-ing animals in his home for non-pet purposes.
Section 5.3 of the Gainesville city code 
states, “No person shall harbor any animal for use other than as a pet within any residential district.”
Though he will be forced to close on June 
23, Baber does not plan on letting his business die. Instead, he and his lawyer, Sondra Ran-don, plan to challenge the city. 
First they will request that the city commis-
sion reinterpret the code for Baber’s case. If that fails, an alternative would be to appeal to the city to revise the code. 
“It’s gonna be an uphill battle,” Randon said. “We’re really gonna need local support, because I think we’re gonna need to have the 
code amended.” 
However, even if Baber is 
able to overcome the code bar-ring animals from being in a 
residential area for non-pet pur-
poses, Randon said he still has yet another ob-
stacle to overcome. 
While the city of Gainesville requires that home-based businesses not spill outside the boundaries of the house itself, one of Mydog-space’s attractions is the dogs’ ability to move freely from the house to the backyard. 
Randon said she is not entirely optimistic 
that the business will be able to find a way 
around the regulations placed on home busi-
nesses by the city. Baber said he doesn’t want to think about what he will do if the business must close down.

UF takes home six individual titles at NCAA Outdoor Champion ships
with a 2010 American-leading leap of 17.09 
meters. 
Mariam Kevkhishvili won her fifth 
NCAA shot put title (indoors and outdoors), becoming just the second athlete in NCAA history to claim five women’s shot put championships.The senior thrower completed her amaz-
ing career by going undefeated as a colle-giate competitor in her final two seasons at UF.
“For our women to come in here with 
seven athletes and place third is a great ac-
complishment,” Holloway said.
In all, the Gators won six individual 
NCAA titles during the meet.
While several other Gators didn’t score points for their team, that didn’t mean they 
didn’t perform up to standards. 
Freshman distance runner 
Josh Izewski ran a lifetime personal-best time of 29:37.85 in the men’s 10,000-meter race, the eighth-fastest time in school history. 
Senior distance runner Julie Northrup, 
a runner in the women’s steeplechase, ran the second-fastest time in UF history at 10:20.58.
The Gators concluded the 2009-2010 
campaign winning the men’s NCAA Indoor Championship, men’s Southeastern Confer-ence Outdoor Championship, women’s SEC Cross Country Championship, women’s SEC Indoor Championship and finishing 
second and third, respectively, at the NCAA 
Outdoor Championships.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
AUSTIN, Texas — The Big 12 is 
alive and kicking. 
The University of Texas on 
Monday said it was staying in the 
Big 12, followed moments later by 
pledges from Oklahoma, Oklahoma State and Texas A&M to remain in a league that seemed to be falling apart last week when Nebraska (Big Ten) and Colorado (Pac-10) decided to leave over the next two years.
The Texas announcement came 
shortly after Pac-10 commissioner 
Larry Scott confirmed to The Asso-ciated Press in an e-mail that Texas had declined an invitation to become 
the 12th member of his conference. Scott said Texas president William Powers Jr. told him “the 10 remain-ing schools in the Big 12 Conference intend to stay together.”
Powers wouldn’t give any de-
tails about why the school decided to stay put when asked by the AP. 
Texas scheduled a news conference 
for Tuesday morning.
A person with direct knowledge 
of discussions among the Big 12’s remaining members said Texas is clear to set up its own TV network and keep all proceeds in exchange 
for remaining in the Big 12. 
The Pac-10 courted Texas and other Big 12 South Division schools, while Texas A&M reportedly ex-
pressed interest in going to the Southeastern Conference.
“Texas A&M is a proud mem-
ber of the Big 12 Conference and will continue to be affiliated with the conference in the future,” school president R. Bowen Loftin said in a statement.
The news that the Big 12 survived 
spread quickly.
“That’s great news,” said Scott 
Drew, whose Baylor men’s basket-ball team advanced to the South regional final in the NCAA Tourna-ment a few months ago. “Obvious-
ly, we’re very excited and pleased 
about the 10 schools staying togeth-er. It will be great to continue the ri-valries and traditions.”
Texas A&M regent Gene Stallings 
said Monday he wants the Big 12 to survive and would vote to keep the Aggies in the league. 
“I know how hard all the Big 12 
coaches have worked to make our conference the No. 1 conference in the country,” Baylor’s Drew said. “When you achieve that status, you obviously don’t want to see it disap-pear.”
Texas, three others to remain in Big 12 Conference
 “Obviously, we’re very 
excited and pleased about 
the 10 schools staying 
together. It will be great to 
continue the rivalries and 
traditions.”

POLL RESULTS UF BASKETBALL TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGHarrison Diamond, Alligator Staff
UF beat Miami in the 10th inning on Saturday to earn its sixth trip in school history to the College World Series in Omaha, 
Neb. The Hurricanes committed nine errors in the super regional which led to eight unearned runs by the Gators.

THE TWO-GAME SWEEP OF MIAMI.

The Gators’ hopes of clinching a berth to the College 
World Series seemed dead.
But Miami’s defense revived them.
Down by just one run in the ninth, No. 4 Florida 
loaded the bases with two outs.
But the Gators didn’t need a hit to get the job done – 
all they needed was Miami’s sixth error of the game on a routine ground ball off the bat of junior Josh Adams.
UF took advantage of the Hurricanes’ lackluster de-
fense on Saturday to punch its ticket to Omaha, Neb., for the sixth time in school history with a 4-3 victory over No. 20 Miami in front of a record 5,783 people in McKethan Stadium. The Gators will begin the CWS this 
weekend with a matchup against No. 8 UCLA.
“It’s tough when you are dealing with 18- and 19 
year-old young men,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
“When so much is at stake at this time of the year, little Gators sweep 
‘Canes to earn

They say Americans don’t care 
about soccer. They say Ameri-cans will never embrace the 
sport the way they embrace football, basketball, baseball and even hockey.
And while they may have been 
right before, the 2010 FIFA World Cup might have them altering their stance.
When the United States took the 
pitch Saturday afternoon to face England in the teams’ World Cup openers, it seemed as though people around here had a new attitude to-
ward soccer. 
It may have just been because 
the Yanks were taking on their big 
brother to kick off the festivities, or it could be that Americans are starting to catch soccer fever.
ABC, the network that carried the 
game’s broadcast, scored big with the opening-round match between the U.S. and England as roughly 13 million view-ers tuned into 
the 1-1 draw.
Accord-
ing to data 
from Nielsen, 8.39 million households 
in America were watching the U.S. debut in South Africa.
That made it the most-watched 
opening-round World Cup game since 1994 when the Americans played Romania. It also made it the highest-rated U.S. game since it took on Brazil in the quarterfinals 16 years ago.
Overall, the match was the fifth 
highest-rated World Cup match in the 2010 World Cup brings 
soccer fever to AmericaTRACK

If history is any indication, the Gators 
men’s track and field team could find itself 
with an NCAA Outdoor Championship next 
season.
A year after finishing in second place, two 
points behind the eventual champions, Florida 
came that much closer to immortality, finish-ing second, just one point behind the NCAA Outdoor Champions Texas A&M at the 2010 NCAA Outdoor Championships in Eugene, Ore.
“We were within two points last year and 
one point this year, so we’re getting closer,” UF coach Mike Holloway said. “Now, we have 365 days from this point to get ready to 
come back and fight for the NCAA title.”
While the UF men fell just short, the wom-
en’s team used a remarkable final day to also 
finish in the top-three of the outdoor champi-onships.
Florida’s men placed second overall with 
54 team points, while the women’s team – behind just seven athletes – finished in third place with 40 team points.
“I am extremely proud of our team today,” 
Holloway said. “For both our programs to fin-ish in the top three is a great accomplishment. 
I have to give credit to my staff for their hard 
work and diligence.”
While Texas A&M claimed both the men’s 
and women’s national titles, several Gators still put on a show.
Charlotte Browning won the women’s 
1,500-meter run with a time of 4:15.84, and 
Evelien Dekkers won the women’s javelin with a 
school-record toss of 59 
meters. Dekkers shattered her own personal-record throw and became the first 
women’s javelin champion in school history.
The men’s 4x100-meter 
relay team successfully de-
fended its NCAA title, winning the race be-
hind a strong quartet anchored by 100-meter 
champion Jeff Demps. The 4x100-meter relay team won with a time of 39.04. 
Earlier in the week, the Gators claimed 
three other individual championships includ-ing Demps’ blazing win in the 100-meter dash (9.69).

U.S., coming in behind the 1994 open-
er and Brazil quarterfinals matchups, the 1994 Brazil and Italy final and the 2006 final of Italy and France.
Keep in mind, of course, the 
numbers from Saturday are just es-timates and don’t take into account the national viewers who watched the match online on ESPN3 or the 4.1 million people that caught the Span-ish broadcast on Univision.
The numbers also don’t reflect the 
number of people who went to bars or restaurants to tune in, so the ac-
tual numbers are likely much higher. 
I know I went to a bar to catch the match and people were packed in there shoulder-to-shoulder.
More than just being there to 
watch the match and have drinks, people were getting into what was unfolding before their eyes on the television screens. It was like watch-
ing the Super Bowl or an NBA Fi-
nals game – except this was for an opening-round match in a sport Americans have been known to not embrace.
In the past, people may not have 
cared about soccer as much, but the current U.S. men’s national team has more recognizable names and faces than I can ever remember. Landon Donovan has been the most well-known figure in American soccer for years now, but this time he is joined by Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey, Jozy 
Altidore and Carlos Bocanegra. 
Following America’s silver medal-
showing in Olympic hockey earlier 
this year, the NHL received a ratings boost. Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals was the highest-rated NHL game in more than three decades. 
I can see the same thing happen-
ing with soccer.
Not to say that it’s going to jump 
into the American forefront after the World Cup ends, but I believe the World Cup will increase the sport’s livelihood in America and the young faces of the U.S. team are going to bring about a new interest in the sport that we haven’t seen in the past, and more Americans than ever will 
start to embrace soccer.TOM , from page 19Maddox drives in winning run in 10th
things like that can come back to either help you 
or haunt you.”
Adams reached base in the ninth because of 
a weak throw from Miami shortstop Stephen Perez, which allowed the ball to bounce in the dirt before it reached the first baseman.
The critical error allowed sophomore Preston 
Tucker to score and tie the game at three. The 
Gators eventually won the game on a go-ahead 
double from Austin Maddox in the 10th inning to bring freshman Nolan Fontana home.
“I’ve been seeing the ball well all weekend,” 
Maddox said. “I got a good pitch to hit and put a good swing on it and came up big time. I’ll re-
member that hit for the rest of my life.”
Fontana’s run was also unearned as he 
reached base on a fielding error.
Miami’s seven errors in the second game of 
the series didn’t help pitcher Chris Hernandez, 
who threw a gem Saturday. He lasted 8.1 innings while giving up just three hits.
The Gators scored eight unearned runs on 
nine errors by the Hurricanes in the two super 
regional games.
However, UF’s defense didn’t give its starting 
pitcher Hudson Randall those same problems.
Randall used two double plays and a stellar 
diving catch from UF center fielder Matt den 
Dekker to throw 6.2 innings and allow just two runs. The freshman struck out five to continue his recent success.
Randall is sporting a 2.14 ERA in his last 11 
starts.
“I was coming in trying to give our team the 
same chance we had yesterday,” he said. “Our offense has been on a roll now, so I knew they were going to get some runs for me.”
Florida’s bullpen was just as good. Four re-
lievers combined to pitch 3.1 innings of one-run baseball.
The UF pitching staff limited Miami’s offense, 
which came into the super regional averaging more than 11 runs per game in its last seven con-tests, to just five total runs in the super regional.
 UF has a team ERA of 2.00 in the two rounds 
preceding the CWS. 
Sophomore Greg Larson recorded the final 
two outs for the Gators to close out the game and begin the celebration.
“This is what I came back for,” den Dekker 
said. “This is definitely the best moment of my career.”BASEBALL , from page 19
