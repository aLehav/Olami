The Student Health Care Cen-
ter gave out its last 800 free ﬂ  u 
shots to students, faculty and staff Wednesday.
SHCC Marketing Coordina-
tor Catherine Seemann said the center doesn’t have any more vaccines, and she doesn’t know when more will be available.
“We will be putting infor-
mation out as soon as we know something,” she said.
The event started at 8 a.m., 
and it was supposed to last until 2 p.m., but the center ran out of shots by 1 p.m.,  Seemann said.  
Since September, the SHCC 
has given about 9,000 shots, which is about twice as much as last year.
Theodore Weppelmann usu-
ally doesn’t get ﬂ  u shots, but he decided to get one this year.
“I heard that the ﬂ  u was gon-
na be bigger this year than most years,” the 26-year-old landscape architecture graduate student said. “So, I decided to be better safe than sorry.”
Shots for students are nor-
mally free. Wednesday, faculty and staff also received free shots, paid by UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Human Re-source Services, Seemann said.
Although the SHCC is out of 
shots, Seemann said there are still some available in the com-munity.
She said students who are in-
terested should check local phar-macies or community providers.
If someone didn’t get a ﬂ  u 
shot and can’t locate one, See-mann said, good hygiene, plenty of ﬂ  uids, enough sleep and exer-cise will help the immune system ﬁ  ght the illness.

University Police arrested a Gators 
football player Wednesday morning after 
police said he possessed a stolen mo-ped scooter and drove with a suspended driver’s license.
UPD ofﬁ  cers arrested Jessamen Dunker, a 19-year-old freshman, and charged him with driving with a suspended license and grand theft auto, according to a UPD arrest report.
At about 10 a.m. Wednesday, a UPD 
ofﬁ  cer saw Dunker driving a scooter close behind a UF Physical Plant work truck on Stadium Road, said UPD spokesman Brad Barber.The ofﬁ  cer pulled Dunker over at the 
South End Zone of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium and noticed the scooter didn’t have a license 
plate, Barber said.
When the ofﬁ  cer ran 
the scooter’s make and model through a police computer, it reported that the mo-ped was stolen. 
Dunker was also 
driving with a suspended license from a trafﬁ  c ticket he failed to pay in 2011.
After his arrest, Dunker told the 
ofﬁ  cer that he did not steal the vehicle and purchased it from someone for $600, according to the report.
Police arrested Dunker and booked him 
into the Alachua County jail at about noon, where he remained later that evening without bond, according to jail records.
The arrest marked Dunker’s second 
incident with police in three months.

People who have recently eaten 
at the Zaxby’s on Archer Road 
could be at risk of identity theft. 
Zaxby’s Franchising Inc. 
announced Friday it will implement additional security measures after it discovered a data security breach in computer systems at more than 100 locations.
In Florida, the breach affected 
stores in Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Orange City and Ocala. It also reached the Zaxby’s at 3710 SW Archer Road in Gainesville. An employee at the store said no customers were affected, to his knowledge.
On their systems, the affected 
stores identiﬁ  ed suspicious ﬁ  les that could have potentially allowed unauthorized access to credit and debit card information or have been identiﬁ  ed by credit card processing companies as common points of purchase for some fraudulent activity, according to a company news release.
Forensic investigators have 
not determined whether credit or debit card data left the processing systems of any of the locations, according to the release.GPD spokesman Ben Tobias 
said it’s hard to tell if breaches occur more often, or they are reported more frequently.
He advised recent stores’ 
customers to check their ﬁ  nancial information for any suspicious behavior.
“It’s so easy, in these days, to 
track your credit cards and debit cards,” he said. “It’s so easy, why not do it?”

In December 2010, Laura Mc-
Keeman wondered aloud to her 
Zeta Tau Alpha sisters about how she could get money to pay for her Summer class.
When her friends suggested 
that she enter Florida Blue Key’s Miss University of Florida Pageant to win some money, McKeeman rejected the idea — at first.
Nearly two years later, the 
24-year-old UF alumna placed in the top 16 as Miss Florida in the Miss America pageant Saturday.
“I came away with a bunch of 
great friends,” McKeeman said. “I’m excited to tell my kids and grandkids.”
McKeeman, who graduated 
in 2011 with a degree in telecom-munication, passed the swimsuit round of the competition but did not advance to the evening-gown round.
“It was such an honor to be 
called,” she said. “It was a total surprise to me.”
M c K e e m a n 
began entering 
pageants as a ju-nior in college. Since Miss UF, she has compet-ed in nine pag-eants, and she won Miss Florida in July 2012.
McKeeman started preparing 
for the national competition when she won Miss Florida.
As a FOX Sports reporter cov-
ering Pacific-12 Conference bas-ketball, she said she found herself rehearsing her dance routine while on a conference call with coaches.
While she was a student at UF, 
McKeeman was involved with her sorority, Cicerones and WRUF Sports Radio 850.
“UF is the type of school that can 
truly open doors, no matter where you knock on them,” she said.
Steve Russell, sports director at 
WRUF-AM 850, worked with McK-eeman on “The Cheap Seats” show. He said he watched Miss America to support his former student.
“For anyone who wants to make 
it, she’s proof that you can,” Rus-sell said. “She’s a role model.”
Mara Abeleda, a 23-year-old 
finance alumna, was a freshman when she first met McKeeman on a Cicerones tradition keepers tour. The competed in the Miss Florida pageant together.
“We never felt like we were 
ever competing against each oth-er,” Abeleda said.
McKeeman will juggle her work 
with her Miss Florida duties, which involve traveling the state for speaking engagements until July.
“It would’ve been such an hon-
or to be Miss America, but I love being Miss Florida,” she said.

In an effort to reduce gun-
related crimes and deaths in the 
United States, President Barack Obama unveiled several new proposals Wednesday aimed to strengthen gun control laws.
The $500 million dollar plan 
consists of 23 executive mea-sures, which range from closing background check loopholes to increasing access to mental health services.
The proposals come about a 
month after the Sandy Hook Ele-mentary School shooting that left 26 dead in Newtown, Conn.
Obama stressed the impor -
tance of protecting children from gun violence.
“What we should be thinking 
about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do ev-erything that they’re capable of  doing,” he said, “not just to pur -
sue their own dreams, but to help build this country.”At UF, student political orga-
nizations chimed in on Obama’s gun control proposals.
Katy Melchiorre, a 21-year-
old political science and telecom-munication senior and UF Col-lege Republicans chairwoman, said she supports law-abiding citizens owning guns, and said tragedies, like the one at Sandy Hook Elementary, are not com-mitted by people who follow the law.
“While the president is focus-
ing on gun regulation, I hope that Congress can focus on the under -
lying issues behind the tragedy , like our country’s mental health system, because I believe that is where the reform is needed — not guns,” she said.
Rachel McGovern, a 20-year-old political science junior and UF College Democrats vice president, said she agrees with Obama’s proposals.
“I’m proud the man I voted 
into office is really taking a 
stand on this issue,” she said.
Obama called for Congress 
to require background checks on 
every person purchasing a gun. He also proposed to restore a ban on the sale of military-style as-sault weapons.
Obama’s plan was met with 
opposition from critics, including the National Rifle Association. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL, voiced his support for citizens to bear arms.
“Rather than sweeping mea-
sures that make it harder for re-sponsible, law-abiding citizens to purchase firearms,” he said in a statement, “we should focus on the root causes of gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.”

Obama reveals gun control plan
Dunker is the 12th player arrested under coach Will Muschamp
In November, he shouted expletives at 
police officers after he received a citation 
for failing to wear a seat belt.
A UPD officer was put on leave following 
the incident for failing to file a police report on the citation until the following day.
Dunker is the 12th football player 
arrested since Will Muschamp took over for Urban Meyer as Florida’s coach in January 2011. Other players ar -
rested under Muschamp have  included Marcus Roberson for underage possession of alcohol, Leon Orr on marijuana-related charges and A.C. Leonard for domestic bat-tery, according to Alliga-
tor archives.
More than 30 player arrests occurred 
during Meyer’s six-year tenure.A former four-star recruit who attended 
Boynton Beach High, Dunker redshirted during the 2012 season — his first with the Gators. 
Muschamp considered putting Dunker 
in as starting guard after James Wilson, a former Gator offensive lineman, graduated this season.
The 6-feet-6-inch offensive guard was 
a Parade High School All-American and played in the 2011 Under Armour All-America Game. He chose to attend UF instead of 
Auburn University, Georgia University, University of Alabama and Louisiana State University.
A UF Athletic Association spokesman 
wrote in an email that coach Muschamp is “aware of the incident” and will address Dunker’s arrest during a scheduled news conference Friday.

A fight about cigarettes led to a Hawthorne 
man’s arrest Wednesday morning. His girlfriend 
accused him of punching her in the mouth and knocking out her tooth.
Gainesville Police charged James L. Coney, 52, 
of 1960 NE 12th Ave., with felony battery, accord-ing to a GPD arrest report.
The incident started at about 
2 a.m., when Coney and his girl-friend of about nine months, Cheryl Rene Pierce, were on 
their way back from a birthday party Pierce planned for Coney, Pierce said.
The couple stopped at a Kan-
garoo Express off Northeast 
Waldo Road to buy cigarettes. 
Inside, Coney wanted Pierce to buy two packs 
of cigarettes, but she only had enough cash for one.
Coney became mad, Pierce said, and the 
couple started to argue. The fight continued on the drive to visit Coney’s daughter, who is also Pierce’s cousin, at her apartment on the 3200 block of Southwest 25th Way, Pierce said.
When they arrived, the argument escalated, 
and Coney punched Pierce twice in the mouth, knocking out one of her front teeth.“He knocked it out from the root,” she said. 
“Blood was everywhere, and the tooth was in the bushes.”
Pierce said her cousin was in the bathroom 
during the incident. After the second punch, Pierce ran into the house and told her cousin to call 911.
When GPD officers arrived, they caught Co-
ney as he tried to run away from the scene, Pierce said.
After his arrest, Coney admitted to police that 
he punched Pierce, but said she slapped him first. 
Police noted that Coney had a 2- to 3-inch cut 
on his fist and bloodstains on his T-shirt.
At about 8 a.m. Wednesday, officers booked 
Coney into the Alachua County Jail, where he re-mained later that evening without bond.
Pierce said she’s still deciding what to do about 
her tooth after she declined to go to the hospital after the incident.
“It was something I could deal with,” she said, 
“but it’s hurting.”

28% NOToday’s question: Have you eaten at the Zaxby’s on 
Archer Road recently?
58 TOTAL VOTESWednesday’s question: Do you think Silver Springs should be a state park?Gov. Scott: 
He-Who-Must-Not-
Have-Shame
Hear us out:
Think back to when you ﬁ  rst read through the Harry 
Potter book series. Remember how terrible it was in 
the ﬁ  fth book, when the Ministry of Magic started controlling 
Hogwarts too much, and it sucked? Remember how Voldemort made seven Horcruxes that split up his soul so he wouldn’t die all at once, and one of those was his snake, Nagini?
Get ready to jump the shark with us.The joke is that Gov . Rick Scott looks a lot like V oldemort (it’s 
not, like, a funny joke, because he actually does look like him, but we digress).
Years ago, Scott cut the education budget in our state by $3 
billion, and it sucked. Now, all of a sudden, he’s increasing edu-cation budgets all over the place. Last week, he “promised to ensure the University of Florida reaches the ranks of the nation’s 10 best public universities,” according to the Sun Sentinel.
What a change of heart! Maybe Scott saw the error of his 
ways and remembered that the children are the future. Maybe he wanted our state to have something to be proud of instead of feeling shame about what happens here!
During the 2010 election campaign, the Scott family adopted 
an adorable dog, then made this announcement: “The Scott fam-ily is proud to announce that the name (chosen by you) for their newly adopted pup is Reagan! Thanks to everyone who partici-pated in the fun contest,’’ according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Then, someone realized we hadn’t seen Reagan in a while.“Asked last week what had happened to the dog, Scott’s cur-
rent and former communications directors refused to answer,” the paper wrote.
Uh oh. This doesn’t bode well for Nagini — excuse us — for 
Reagan.
Scott eventually spoke about the dog and said that, as a needy 
rescue dog, Reagan couldn’t get over his fear of people carrying things, according to the paper.
So the family returned the dog it adopted during an election 
cycle to All Pets Grooming & Boarding a month after the Scotts moved to Tallahassee.
Then what happened to the snake — sorry! — dog?You can’t just return an animal because it scared one of your 
kitchen staff members and a photographer. First of all, stop hav-ing house elves — sorry! — kitchen staff, and maybe you won’t have that problem. The family , of course, has a new dog that is reportedly sweet and needy-in-a-cute-way.
When reporters at BuzzFeed started to dig to ﬁ  nd out what 
happened to Reagan when the Scott family returned him, they ran into an information roadblock. At ﬁ  rst, employees had no idea what happened to the dog. Apparently, upon further in-vestigation, we learned that Reagan now lives on a horse farm, and his name is Pluto.
No one is buying the whole dog-now-lives-on-farm story. It 
didn’t work when we were kids, and it’s sure as hell not going to work now.
All we’re saying is that maybe the Dark Lord Scott could con-
sider being nice to students and animals at the same time.Clubbing isn’t a good time for everyone
UF is one of the top-rated party schools in the U.S.
Partying is our forte, as we are known for being 
the sports-crazed, fun-in-the-sun university with 
the hottest student population. On almost any night, Mid-
town and downtown are ﬁ  lled with guys and girls walk-ing around in search of a fun time.
I never partied in high school, but I was certainly not 
a sore thumb. When I began to make more friends at UF, my Facebook newsfeed became cluttered with photos of bars, clubs and house parties. My friends endlessly talked about the scandalous and unexpected things they did or saw the night before — things that would never happen in broad daylight.
There was an element of mystery to what happened. 
How could the street across from Library West, with Mochi, Chipotle and Leonardo’s Pizza by the Slice, turn so chaotic at night? 
As a student at this party institution, I decided to give 
the party scene a chance. And so my search for the true UF college experience began.
My freshman year, I made plans to go to a club in Mid-
town with several friends. They were excited and enthusi-astic to show me what I was missing. We enjoyed getting dressed up. In the end, I wore an outﬁ  t that was comfort-able and casual, yet did not give the idea that I walked there straight from class. 
The club was very popular but very unsanitary. The 
bathroom was disgusting, and the place smelled like beer and smoke. It was dark, but I preferred the lights off for fear of what I would see.
To recount my ﬁ  rst clubbing experience, I was con-
fused. I failed to see what everyone loved so much about the place. It was cramped and crowded. People were ei-ther huddled by the bar or on the dance ﬂ  oor, reenacting the same movements beat after beat. With a lack of alcohol in my body, I stood there, bobbed my head and smiled at my friends as they searched to ﬁ  nd a look of satisfaction on my face.
I felt awkward and out of place. 
I felt alone in a crowded room. I couldn’t talk to my friends, and they couldn’t talk to me.
Shouting and repeating, “Hey, 
how are you?” then nodding to an ambiguous response wasn’t so-cializing to me; it was isolation.
“This is it?” I thought. “This is what everyone does ev-
ery week. What’s fun about this?”
As I looked around with my plastered smile, I began 
to wonder: “Are people enjoying this? Is this a good time? Does anyone else have an 8:30 a.m. class tomorrow?” 
Partying isn’t for everyone, but there aren’t many other 
outlets for entertainment in Gainesville. For anyone with some free time and an ounce of curiosity, the party scene is the obvious option. My experience gave me less than I expected, but I am envious of those who look forward to such nights and ﬁ  nd stress relief and excitement from it.
I suspect there are others who, like me, prefer catching 
up with friends instead of a loud party, but this may be the only time in our lives that this is acceptable.
Partying is the American college tradition. The party 
scene is a potent mix of longing for acceptance, youth and alcohol. Behaviors that are unacceptable elsewhere are al-lowed and expected. It’s a safe place for those who choose to express themselves in a different way.
Maybe clubbing is an acquired taste, and it may take 
some people longer to get the hang of it. Maybe some of us actually have fun, like those from my Facebook newsfeed, and the rest keep trying, in search of a good time.  
If you’re certain this isn’t your scene, worry not.College will be over soon, and we’ll be out of Gainesville 
before we know it.

Most businesses prefer the in-
struments on display remain un-
touched, but at The JAM it is a must for musicians to pick up an instru-ment and show off their talents.
The JAM, a music bar at 817 W. 
University Ave., provides live mu-sic and welcomes anyone to play music on its stage.
“We want to foster the musicians 
and the artists around town,” said Blake Briand, 34-year-old co-own-er of The JAM. “We want everyone to find that this is a place they can come and show their stuff.”
Briand operates The JAM with 
co-owners Eddy Arenas, 34, and Veronica Arenas, 31, siblings and UF alumni.
The JAM is open from 8 p.m. 
to 2 a.m. Monday through Satur -
day. It hosts different theme nights such as jazz nights Monday, reggae Tuesday, world Wednesday and open jam night Thursday. Differ -
ent local bands play Friday and Saturday. If no bands are booked, the venue hosts a drum circle in its spacious backyard.
“It’s a comfortable environ-
ment that opens my mind to music I’ve never listened to before,” said Margarita Khariton, a 20-year-old chemical engineering junior.
The JAM provides a full range 
of instruments and equipment on the inside stage. There are guitars hanging from the walls, a piano and various types of drums are around the bar.
“There is a serious lack of good 
music venues in Gainesville that keep the musician in mind and not just whatever they can make mon-eywise,” Eddy Arenas said.The JAM’s philosophy is to cre-
ate a venue where musicians come back because they have a good time and are treated well.
“That is important to us,” Bri-
and said. “We apply that same thing to the audience. We want them to have a good time and leave thinking that it was a good experi-ence.”
Beer, wine, tea and other hot 
beverages are featured on the drink menu, including beverages from local brewing companies like Otter & Trout Trading Co Inc., Cigar City Brewing and Farm Boy Produce.
Kombucha, a nonalcoholic, fer -
mented tea that is good for health and digestion, combined with sake compose the signature drink play-fully named kombusake, Eddy Arenas said.
The JAM is a place for people 
of all ages, said Kristin Rusoff, a 21-year-old microbiology and cell science senior.
“It is a fun place to hang out 
when you get done with down-town,” she said.
Although there is support from 
the community, the future of The JAM is uncertain.
“Unfortunately, there is a loom-
ing threat that this is all going to get torn down. It’s up in the air right now,” Eddy Arenas said. “This whole property now belongs to the Innovation Square.”
The co-owners hope to build 
a name for themselves, so that, if necessary, they will survive a loca-tion change.
“Until then, we’re going to ride 
this place until the wheels fall off,” Eddy Arenas said.THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2013

In an age when an erotic novel like “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” can become the fastest-selling 
paperback ever, it is no wonder that sado-masochism has hit the theatrical stage. What is astonishing is just how funny, thrilling and completely brilliant an S&M play like the Hip-podrome State Theatre’s “V enus in Fur” can be.
Following in the footsteps of an already 
phenomenal 40th season, “Venus in Fur” de-livers a truly unforgettable 90 minutes of the-ater that may prove to be the Hippodrome’s best production of the year.
The show opens in the sparse city office of Thomas, the writer/director of a new play adaptation of the erotic 19th century novel “Venus in Furs” that has yet to find its leading lady. Then the young, eccentric actress Vanda walks in and gives new meaning to work-ing the casting couch. The late night audition starts innocent enough but quickly spirals out of control, revealing the crazy power and sexual struggle experienced between men and women.
“Venus in Fur” debuted on Broadway in 
2011 to mostly unanimous rave reviews, and its debut in Gainesville this past weekend de-serves similar accolades.
This two-person play features three key 
performances that warrant a wealth of ap-plause: actors Tim Altmeyer, Lauren Nordvig and director Lauren Caldwell. There’s no de-nying the cleverness of David Ives’s script, but it is the work of the previously mentioned trio of talent, all with ties to UF, that elevated this wholly enjoyable production to inconceivable heights.
This is Altmeyer’s the-
atrical season. Previously the director of the Hippo-drome’s incredible produc-tion of “Other Desert Cit-ies,” Altmeyer now stands center stage, as he rightly should, playing the com-
plex man at the helm of a sexy and daring new show. His impeccable diction and overall command of the material shined from the very first moment the fluorescents lit up the stage.
In a role that won Nina Arianda the 2012 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, Nor -
dvig gave a performance that is equally wor -
thy of such a prestigious award. It is highly uncommon, yet extremely exhilarating to find a young artist like Nordvig who embodies every possible vocal, physical and emotional quirk of her character. To borrow a line from Vanda, Nordvig’s “a-MAH-zing” portrayal of a multi-faceted actress is breathtaking to be-hold.
Although this play is definitely not suitable 
for all audiences, Caldwell’s direction was both tasteful and well received as evidenced by the standing ovation at curtain call.
The thunder and lightning that intermit-
tently interrupted Vanda’s audition was nothing compared to the electricity that en-capsulated this entire spectacular production. “Venus in Fur” will continue its run at the Hippodrome Theatre until Feb. 3.

If Lancelot and Guinevere 
were enlightened thinkers sneak-
ing around behind a kooky King Arthur’s back, then “A Royal Affair” would be a visual story-book of their dangerous affair.
Starring Mads Mikkelsen as 
innovative German doctor Jo-hann Struensee, the affair itself doesn’t see screen time until half-way through the film. However, the beautiful Danish scenery and architecture make for a nice view while the audience waits.
Alicia Vikander co-stars as 
Queen Caroline Mathilde, the quietly suffering bride of “dis-turbed” King Christian VII of Denmark, played by Mikkel Boe Folsgaard. 
King Christian, a rambunc-
tious soul who is often in the company of women, was no more in charge than his canine companion in a country ruled by divine right. 
Fearing his misbehavior, the 
court calls for a personal physi-cian (Mikkelsen), who quickly wins over the king with a spirit-ed Shakespeare-quoting contest.But — as all royal scandals go 
— the queen and the doctor com-bine their enlightened thoughts and use Stuensee’s influence on Christian. Their dangerous com-mitment — and secret love child — ultimately make the teetering regime fall further into dark-ness.
Mikkelsen’s sturdy expres-
sions mixed with Vikander’s soft, questioning gazes make for a believably steamy tryst, and Folsgaard’s cackling, moody Christian is perfectly clueless to it all. 
Together, the trio comple-
ment each other subtly and ef-fectively.
The film, which won Best 
Actor for Folsgaard and Best Screenplay at the Berlin National Film Festival, is similar to other royal representations like “The Other Boleyn Girl” and “Marie Antoinette” in regards to its lav-ish sets. But the focus on char -
acter sets it apart from its other, more decorative predecessors.
“A Royal Affair” is screening 
at the Hippodrome starting Fri-day. For more information and showtimes, visit www.thehipp.org. The Hipp shares secrets

Between sentimental speeches, 
unexpected successes and mortify-
ing moments, the 70th annual Gold-en Globe Awards was, once again, a top night for Hollywood’s finest.
Throughout the show, the dy-
namic duo of hosts, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, kept the crowd on its toes with wit and class, a welcome change from Ricky Gervais’ more crude hosting style. 
Fey dressed in drag, both stars 
playfully teased the nominees, in-cluding a drink in hand, half-heart-ed salute to “Girls” mastermind Lena Dunham, and canoodled with A-Listers — Amy Poehler Eskimo-kissing George Clooney became the moment that spurned a thousand GIFs.
Front-runners for the evening in-
cluded Jennifer Lawrence for “Silver Linings Playbook,” Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman for “Les Misera-bles,” and Ben Affleck for “Argo.” 
Despite being snubbed by the 
Academy for the Best Director Oscar, Affleck and com-pany scored two awards for “Argo,” prompting the audi-ence’s standing ova-tion. 
Adding to the 
awesome factor, British goddess Adele high-fived Daniel Craig while heading up to accept her award for Best Original Song for “Skyfall.”
Keeping the recurring theme of 
comedy , presenters Kristen Wiig, Will Ferrell and Robert Downey Jr. provided lots of laughs as well. The night also featured moving moments from Hathaway , who thanked fellow nominee Sally Field for inspiring her since her days as “princess of Genovia” and beyond, and Jodie Foster, who received the Cecil B. DeMille Award and caused half the room to tear up.
“Argo” and “Les Miserables” 
took the top film honors, while “Homeland” swept the television category. Daniel-Day Lewis and Jes-sica Chastain scored leading actor wins, while Don Cheadle and Claire Danes garnered television awards.
The road to the Oscars is well 
underway, and now that the Golden Globes has given us its take, ideas for Academy front-runners have al-ready emerged.

“American Idol” season 8 
winner Kris Allen will perform 
at 8 p.m. Jan. 24 at High Dive.  Jillette Johnson and Rachel Rose will join him as opening acts.  
Allen is an Arkansas-bred 
singer/songwriter touring North America in support of his sopho-more album, “Thank You Camel-lia,” which released in May . The Avenue talked to Kris about his upcoming show in Gainesville, his thoughts about being an ex-pectant father and his matura-tion as a songwriter.
Q: Are you excited to play in 
Gainesville? Have you toured in this area before?
A: “I don’t think I’ve done a 
ton of touring in Florida. We’ve done Miami and Tampa a couple of times. But when it comes down to it, I don’t think we’ve done a place like Gainesville. I know Gainesville is a college town, and I love college towns. I really just enjoy going to smaller cities.”
Q: How has your songwrit-
ing and goals as a musician changed from “American Idol” to your first record to the “Thank You Camellia” release?
A: “I think it changed com-
pletely . When I came off the show, I was just a baby. I was re-ally new. I felt like I had a lot of talent but hadn’t really ushered in that talent that much yet. Over the years, I’ve become friends with a lot of musicians and songwriters, and we’ve toured with a lot of amazing artists. I’ve learned so much. I’ve learned what it takes to make it in this business, or at least what I think it takes, anyway . It takes a lot of work, a lot of practice — trying to get better every day . I feel like I’ve done that.”
Q: How did you like sharing 
the stage with Bruce Spring-steen in New York City last October during the Little Kids Rock benefit show? 
A: “It was pretty awesome. I 
think at one point, I was singing in the same mic as Elvis Costello. After the night was over, I was hanging out on stage. I was wait-ing for Bruce to walk back .... He initiated conversation, which I thought was amazing. I guess he was in the crowd when I sang earlier that night. He said, ‘You did a really , really good job.’ It was cool to hear something like that from Bruce Springsteen.”
Q: What are you most excited 
about by becoming a father?
A: “I don’t really know what 
to look forward to. I know it’s going to be a lot of work — a lot of diapers, a lot of poop and stuff like that. After getting our dog a couple years ago, I’ve fallen in love with him. He’s pretty much like my son. But I know that it’s going to be even more intense [when] I have a real kid. I just can’t wait to grow up with [them] and see what kind of person they become.”
Q: Any collaborations with 
other artists in the works? 
A: “There are things in the 
works, but I will keep my se-crets.”
Q: What’s next for you after 
this tour?
A: “I’ll spend some time with 
my family for a little bit because I’ll be gone so long, but also song-writing and getting back into the studio.”

This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international 
studies. Would you like to get some Mediocre Advice? 
Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
I know it is a stereotype, but why, at 
times, are women so sensitive that it is difficult to have a normal conversation? How would you recommend defusing that emotional time bomb, or is it easier to just jump on that grenade and take 
whatever lashing that’s coming?Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is an appropriate age 
difference for dating?Dear Mediocre Advice,     
I’ve learned that half of solving your problems is knowing you have them. Do you have any suggestions 
for how to be more self-aware?
Dear Friend,
Let’s start with middle school — a time when relationships do not count. Yes, I went out with a guy named Flea when I was 13 years old. We went on a group date once and never kissed, but were we ever dating? No. When puberty strikes, the concern about an age gap begins. High school is pretty much a danger zone. What if a male senior dated a female freshman, and she didn’t even have her period yet? Vice versa, it’s still gross. Save yourself the trouble, and stick to your own grade. Although people tend to mature in college, no one does in his or her first year. Even by graduation, a few still fall through the cracks and probably won’t be as mature as they should be for a long time — much like those guys from Tennessee who thought alcohol enemas were a good idea. After a certain point in your 20s, age appropriateness is void again. It depends if the maturity levels of you and your significant other are relatively the same. If you’re dating someone considerably older or younger and worried about judgmental looks, you are not mature enough to date that 
person.Dear Friend,
Ask your parents what they honestly think of you. These people are your creators. They sugarcoat most of the comments they make about your life choices. Ask them to fully critique you as a human being, not as the monster 
they gave birth to. 
Dear Friend,
I’m going to ignore your confusing question and talk about something important. This overly sensitive side of a woman is her being human. Some people are overly sensitive — man or woman. We are led to believe that if a woman is being too sensitive, she is acting like her gender, but if a man is being too sensitive, he is acting like a pussy. This emotion is not a woman thing, it’s a people thing. Everybody has issues. Life is hard. When someone feels a heavy burden on his or her shoulders and acts too sensitive for you, consider that something may actually be wrong. Show some compassion.JENNIFER HERNANDEZ

Target does it again, with an-
other high-low collaboration. The 
superstore will team up with luxury fashion designer Prabal Gurung  for a collection due in stores Feb. 10.
Target’s first designer collabora-
tion was with Issac Mizrahi in 2003, initiating the store’s economic, high-fashion partnerships with luxury brands including Rodarte, Missoni and Jason Wu.
“Most of these promotional sales 
do really well. Jason Wu sold out quickly , and a lot of customers left with several items from the collec-tion,” said Brian Jablonski, store team leader for Target on Archer Road.
Similar to Jason Wu’s swift sale 
last year, Missoni’s release in 2011 was characterized by long lines, sell-outs and online traffic so heavy it crashed Target’s website, according to Time Magazine.
However, Gurung’s collection 
follows the first majorly unsuccess-ful collaboration with Neiman Mar -
cus.
The 50-piece holiday gift line, 
which included fashion giants such as Oscar de la Renta, Marc Jacobs and Marchesa, did not sell as much as expected. Critics called the pre-sentation sloppy , and the items cheap and overpriced, leading to what Time Magazine dubbed an “epic retail fail.”
In the first week of January, Tar -
get still carried items from the line at 70 percent off.
Fashionista.com reports that the 
primary reason the collection was such a dud is that most Target shop-pers had no idea what it was about or who was involved.
“I didn’t hear about it at all, but 
I would have shopped the collec-tion,” said Yamila Gottig, a 20-year-old public relations junior. “I really 
didn’t know that Target was a carri-er for high-fashion clothing.”
Does this mean 
that the Prabal Gurung collabora-tion will be similar 
to the Neiman Marcus flop?
Although the designer did have 
some items in the failed collection, this won’t necessarily be true.
The fashion world buzzed with 
interest when Gurung’s line was an-nounced in October.
In a Target promotional inter -
view, Gurung  said he put a lot of love into the collection — literally . The bright and multi-colored floral-print jackets, skirts and dresses are all said to be inspired by love and Valentine’s Day.
“If they can feel even a little bit 
of the love that I felt when I was de-signing this, I’ll consider it a job well done,” Gurung said.Target collaborations:

and ball-handling responsibilities, but 
coach Billy Donovan still shouts for “Ju-nior” when he wants to relay a message to the offense. 
Although Boynton takes a few ill-
advised threes, his focus on getting the best possible shot has improved. He knows when to attack in transition, and he knows when things need to be slowed down. He knows when to run clock to protect a lead, when to settle the offense to kill off an opponent’s run and even how to take advantage of the extra pos-session in end-of-half situations.
Even with the added responsibility , 
he’s still turned the ball over less fre-quently than every Gator except Erik Murphy, and those two have a signifi-cant lead on the field.  
While Boynton’s praise as a defensive 
stopper has dwindled from the heights it reached during his sophomore year, he is still a great on-ball defender who practi-cally never fouls. 
With Brad Beal gone to the NBA, 
Boynton has increased his defensive re-bound rate by nearly 54 percent from last season. His mark of 3.9 rebounds per game is just .6 fewer than Erik Murphy’s 4.5 obvious math. 
All little things, but all valuable. And 
all signs of a veteran leader with nine NCAA Tournament games under his belt who deserves to be the favorite for SEC Player of the Year. 
The award has been handed out 22 
times in my lifetime (since 1991), and 15 times it has gone to a player from the conference’s regular-season champion.
The season is still very young, but no-
body in the SEC is putting up big enough numbers to buck that trend. And with Florida the prohibitive favorite to take the title — top contenders Kentucky and Missouri have already lost — Boynton has an excellent shot to claim the award in 2013.

Senior Kitty Cullen re-
members it like it was yester -
day . Walking onto the field 
as the first lacrosse team in UF history, she and her team-mates were terrified.
“We were all freshmen 
going out there trembling because we had no idea what we were doing,” Cullen said.
Four years later, that trem-
bling freshman class has de-veloped into senior leaders ready to carry the Gators far into this year’s postseason than last year’s national semi-final appearance.
Florida has started gearing 
up for its season and is pre-paring for an exhibition game on Jan. 24 against the England national team.
When the Class of 2009 
entered UF, the players could only look up to each other. 
Now, the 12 seniors offer 
experience and leadership.  
“Freshman year, we didn’t 
know much,” senior Brittany Dashiell said. “We didn’t have any seniors to lead us and teach us the ways.”
Florida’s trial by fire 
brought its current senior class together early.
“Our experience all to-
gether has made a real impact on the way we play ,” Dashiell said.
Said coach Amanda 
O’Leary: “They came in as freshmen, and it was a whirl-wind of new experiences for them.”
The current seniors took 
Florida from a new program to a Final Four finish in a mat-ter of three years.
“We’ve been through so 
much together,” Cullen said. “We’ve been through so many lows and so many highs.”
The Gators will aim to 
overcome the low of last sea-son’s national semifinal de-feat against Syracuse.
Florida is considered a top 
competitor for the national title.
Winning the ultimate 
prize is something the origi-nal recruiting class wants to experience during its final year at UF.
“We want to win that 
much more for each other,” Cullen said.
O’Leary added: “I couldn’t 
be more pleased with our se-nior class. And no matter how we do this season, they will always go down in history at Florida, and certainly in my heart. They will have a very special place.”14, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY 17, 2013

finish in the 200m at the Crimson Tide In-
door Opener on Saturday  in Birmingham, Ala.
Eutsey came from the back of the group 
after a late start and finished third with a time of 24.12. 
“We’ve been working really hard with 
Ebony to get her focused on getting her speed better, and for some reason she didn’t want to do a lot of sprinting,” Hol-loway said. “But I finally got her to under -
stand that if you want to be a great quar -
ter-miler, then your 200 has to get better. I think what you saw [Saturday] was a by-product of that.”Although Eutsey is sitting out today’s 
meet to give the underclassmen more op-portunities to compete, Florida will have 
33 athletes competing in the Gator Invitational. 
The meet starts at 2 p.m. with the men’s 35-pound weight throw.
“Everyone has enough 
knowledge to know what to do when a meet comes,” Eutsey said.
“This is the most pow-
erful team that I’ve been on since I’ve been here. From the short sprints all the way up to the distance. I feel like our team is young but we still have talent that’s unheard of.”

  As Florida bullied LSU in Ba-
ton Rouge, La., on Saturday, Texas A&M’s Elston Turner was putting 
on a show against Kentucky in Rupp Arena.
  In the Aggies’ 83-71 upset win against the Wildcats in Lexington, Ky., Turner scored a career-best 40 points on 14-of-19 shooting. The 6-foot-5 senior guard drilled 6 of 10 three-pointers, grabbed six re-bounds and notched four assists. 
  The home conference loss was 
Kentucky coach John Calipari’s ﬁ  rst in his four years with the 
Wildcats.
  “I’m surprised that the guy 
went for 40 (points) against Ken-
tucky,” junior center Patric Young said. “You wouldn’t think anyone could do that at Rupp Arena.”
  After watching Turner gain 
national attention, No. 10 Florida (12-2, 2-0 Southeastern Confer-ence) will look to contain him when it travels to Reed Arena in College Station, Texas, to face Texas A&M tonight at 7. 
  Turner leads the Aggies (12-3, 
2-0 SEC) with 17.1 points on 13 ﬁ  eld goal attempts per game. He shoots 46.9 percent from the ﬁ  eld, 44.2 percent from three-point range and 79.5 percent from the charity stripe.   “He can do it a lot of different 
ways,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
  “The thing that was so impres-
sive to me about him scoring in the game against Kentucky was when you see a guy score 40 points, the ﬁ  rst thing I look immediately — the shot attempts. A guy takes 30 shots and scores 40 points, that is really not a big deal.
“When you give a good scorer 
enough attempts at the basket, they are going to score points. The thing that was impressive to me was his number of shots didn’t even equal the amount of points he scored. He scored 40 points on 19 shots. To me, that is a sign of a very efﬁ  cient offensive player.”
  According to KenPom.com, 
Texas A&M has an adjusted of-fensive efﬁ  ciency of 108.1, which is good enough for 47th in the country. 
But Florida’s adjusted efﬁ  cien-
cies of 121.2 on offense and 83.2 on defense each rank second in the NCAA.
  When Florida defeated Texas 
A&M 84-64 on Dec. 17, 2011, at the Orange Bowl Basketball Classic in Sunrise, Turner scored 20 points on 7-of-12 shooting and made 3 of 5 attempts behind the arc. 
  “There will be some things

END OF GREGULATION
  When discussing Kenny Boyn-
ton, fans and onlookers only seem 
to care about one thing: Is he hot, or is he cold? 
  But boiling his value down 
to that single question is a mis-take, one that neglects everything Boynton does as a distributor, playmaker, defender and re-bounder. Instead of rightfully labeling Boynton the frontrun-ner for Southeastern Conference Player of the Year, critics deem him a “streaky shooter” and call it a day . 
  Yes, Boynton’s streakiness 
is tough to deny. He made only seven threes in six games before pouring in eight against Yale on Jan. 6. But those who think Boyn-ton is having a poor season shoot-ing the ball need to adjust their expectations. 
  Boynton has hit 35.5 percent 
of his threes this season. The na-t i o n a l average entering play on Wednes-day was 33.6 per-cent. 
  Aside 
from the ﬁ  rst half of 2011-12 — an 18-game sample over which Boynton shot an uncanny 45.8 percent from three — he’s a career 32.4 percent three-point shooter. That’s just about who he is. With good shot selection — a facet of Boynton’s game that has pleased coach Billy Donovan in recent weeks — maybe the true number is closer to 35 percent.  
  Regardless, what makes Boyn-
ton so effective offensively is his ability to score multiple ways. With each season, Boynton’s abil-ity to drive and ﬁ  nish at the rim has improved. 
  He’s accumulated 1,782 
points, a mark that trails Ronnie Williams’ UF career record by 308. Assuming 16 regular season games plus another six between the SEC and NCAA tournaments (anything less would be a disap-pointment), Boynton can match that record with 14 points per game. 
  He’s averaged 13.8 per game 
this season, so it’ll be close. 
  All too often, this is where 
the discussion of Boynton ends. Shooting and scoring. Shooting and scoring. 
  In reality , there’s much more 
to his game. 
  After three years playing 
alongside Erving Walker, Boyn-ton has become UF’s point guard.

  Junior Ebony Eutsey wasn’t 
happy when coach Mike Hol-
loway suggested she add short sprints to her training routine during the fall semester. 
  But after some convinc-
ing, Holloway got through to Eutsey. 
  “I didn’t used to like sprint-
ing, but since coach Holloway gave me a talk about the more you sprint, the faster you are in the 400 meter and then that car-ries over into the 200 meter as well, I was like, ‘OK, get your mind right, you need to do this,’” Eutsey said. “I feel very comfort-able doing it now.”
  Although Eutsey now enjoys the change in her training, she said the transition wasn’t easy. Eutsey, who specializes in the 400m, said she’s always strug-gled with sprinting. Adding 60m sprints to her routine was difﬁ  cult. 
  “It’s always 
been so hard for me to really sprint fast like 
a true sprinter, so it was kind of hard for me to follow through with it,” Eutsey said. “But then, as time went by, I started to un-derstand that this would help my 400-meter time, so it turned out to be great.”
  Eutsey said she’s been ﬁ  nish-
ing her races strong thanks to the New training paying off

No opposing player has 
scored more than 20 points against the Gators in 14 games this season.
Florida held Georgia’s Ken-tavious Caldwell-Pope to 11 points on 4-of-10 shooting and Florida State’s Michael Snaer to 10 points on 3-of-8 shooting. 
Turner will be the next target 
on UF’s list. 
“We’ll be focused on him,” 
freshman guard Michael Frazier II said. 
“Obviously, he’s a big-time 
scorer for them. When we key on him, we have to force him to take tough twos and not get any open looks.”
