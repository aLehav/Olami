Four of the five officers 
involved in the on-campus 
shooting of a UF graduate stu-
dent were reinstated to their 
duties with the University Po-
lice Department on Thursday.
Only Lt. Stacy Ettel, the 
commanding officer when 
36-year-old Kofi Adu-Brem-pong was shot at his Corry 
Village apartment, has not 
been reinstated as of Monday.
The internal affairs investi-
gation is still ongoing, so Flor-ida law does not allow anyone 
involved to comment on the 
investigation. But UF spokes-
woman Janine Sikes said the 
investigation should be over 
by the end of August, if not 
sooner.
According to a UF press 
release, the university has contracted Margolis Healy & 
Associates to “evaluate UF’s 
internal affairs review proto-
cols and ensure that the police 
department strictly followed 
them during the internal re-
view process.”
The university’s decision 
whether to reinstate Ettel probably won’t be made until 
the investigation has ended, 
she said. The investigation 
will make a final decision 
whether the officers followed 
university policies.
The other four officers—
Bill Ledger, Keith Smith, Wil-
liam Sasser and James Mab-
ry—were reinstated Thursday 
because evidence indicates they followed lawful orders, 
Sikes said. She added that the 
state attorney has decided not 
to charge them.
Those officers returned 
to their former positions, ex-
cept for Sasser, who has now joined the motorcycle unit.
Since the incident, UPD 
has maintained a full staff by moving officers who were 
normally off-patrol to patrol 
duty, Holcomb said.
Meanwhile, the officers 
have been doing non-uni-
formed office duties, he said.
For example, Sasser has 
been assisting Holcomb with bike registrations, answering 
phone calls and other office duties, Holcomb said.
UPD spokesman Capt. Jeff 
Holcomb said he’s not sure 
about the other officers, but 
Sasser told him he has already requested overtime, which is 
something the officers weren’t 
allowed after the shooting, 
until now.
According to Sikes, UPD 
Chief Linda Stump and UF President Bernie Machen are 
working to create a police 
advisory committee. While 
the details of the committee 
have not been determined, 
Sikes said it will probably be 
composed of students and fac-
ulty. What the 
committee will 
do is uncertain.
Student Government sena-
tors unanimously passed a 
resolution calling for a UPD 
review board on June 15.
According to Student Body 
President Ashton Charles, SG 
has yet to see any progress re-
garding the review board. SG 
is waiting for the investiga-
tion’s completion before they act further, she said. UPD and 
the university administration 
has been thorough in its inves-
tigation thus far, she said.
Machen was unavailable 
for comment and will be on vacation for the rest of the 
week, Sikes said. She also said UPD reinstates 
officers involved in Kofi shooting
� SGT. SATCHER CONTRACTED   
H1N1 10 MONTHS AGO.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sgt. Lisa Satcher rides again.
Ten months after she was hos-
pitalized at North Florida Regional Medical Center with the H1N1 virus, Satcher will return to duty as an offi-cer for the Gainesville Police Depart-ment on Tuesday morning.
“It’s a great occasion for us that 
she’s able to come back,” said Tschar-na Senn, public information officer for the department. “Her doctors told her 
that she probably would never even 
be off of oxygen, much less come back as a full-time cop.”
While in the hospital’s intensive 
care unit, Satcher was put in an in-duced coma and placed on a ventila-tor for nearly three months. She near-ly died several times, Senn said.
Her mother, Sheila O’Neill, was 
also hospitalized after contracting 
the same virus, but was unable to re-
cover. She died just four doors down from her daughter in ICU. 
After she left 
North Florida Re-gional Medical Center, Satcher spent time at Select Specialty Hospital 
on Archer Road 
and at home. 
She returned to 
work for GPD in 
mid-April, but not as an officer, be-cause she was not ready to return to the field. Instead, she worked in ad-ministration.
It is unknown how Satcher con-
tracted the virus, though she said she may have gotten it while policing the Florida-Tennessee football game or during a visit to a doctor’s office. 
After a roll call and a short briefing 
in the department’s multi-purpose 
room Monday evening, GPD Capt. 
Bart Knowles introduced Satcher, who tearfully read a thank-you letter to family members and friends who came out to see her re-introduced into police action. 
It was a day she and others thought 
they may never see.
“There were times I’d . . . say ‘I 
don’t think I’m going to make it,’” she said.
Satcher said she had mixed emo-
tions putting on her uniform for the first time since September. It re-minded her of a time her mother was alive. 
But getting back into the squad car 
is a different story. 
“It’s going to be exciting,” she said. 
“I can’t wait, actually. I can’t wait.” Sergeant returns to duty

companies across rural America 
are attempting to lease prop-erty from residents in order to drill for natural gas.Filmmaker Josh Fox received a lucrative offer from an energy company wanting to lease his property to tap into a reservoir of natural gas. 
Fox decided to take his camera 
and meet other rural residents on the front lines of fracking. He traveled to 32 states and dis-covered toxic streams, ruined aquifers, dying livestock, brutal illnesses and kitchen sinks that burst into flames. He learns that all water is connected, and 
perhaps some things are more 
valuable than money.

� ALPHA PHI ALPHA’S GPA, 3.14, 
WAS THE HIGHEST IN THE STATE.
  By MICHAELA TRIMBLE
 Alligator Contributing Writer
 
  The men of Alpha Phi Alpha beat out 
more than 700 other chapters of the frater-
nity to be crowned the Outstanding College Chapter of the Year.
     The judging criteria included many stan-
dards, such as how well the chapter imple-mented the fraternity’s national initiatives and the students’ overall GPA, which was 
3.14 for UF.   The chapter won the award at 
the fraternity’s national convention in Las Vegas, Nev., on July 25.
The award is a point of pride for the 
Greek community, said Abby Myette, an 
adviser to the National Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil, the organization that oversees nine fra-ternities, including Alpha Phi Alpha. 
  “I think that they are a group of men 
who are very committed to their organiza-tion,” Myette said. “They work together as a great team.”
  Alpha Phi Alpha’s UF President Hamar-
do Sinclair said he enjoyed the recognition of the award, but doesn’t want to lose sight of the true goal of positively inﬂ  uencing 
more people and touching more lives. 
  “Our plans for the future are 
not only to continue what we 
started with this recognition as Outstand-ing College Chapter of the Year,”  Sinclair 
said. “We want to continue to think of new 
ways to have bigger and better results.”  The chapter completed all three of the 
fraternity’s national programs this year. 
The chapter did Project Alpha, a pro-
gram where members taught boys about STDs and pregnancy prevention; “Go-to-High-School, Go-to-College,” a mentor-ing program that encouraged young men 
to prepare for their academic future; and 
“A Voteless People is a Hopeless People,” where the chapter helped 17-year-olds and low-income people register to vote. 
  The UF chapter also had the highest 
GPA in the state.  Fraternity named year’s most outstanding chapter
STUDENT LIFE
  By VICTORIA LASAVATH
 Alligator Contributing Writer
 
  UF students have a new option to 
consider when getting textbooks. 
  Students can now rent their text-
books through a new deferment pro-gram that allows ﬁ  nancial aid to be used for books before the money is dis-bursed to the student. 
  This option is available at the UF 
Bookstore, located at the Welcome Center in the Reitz Union, the College of Veterinary Medicine Bookstore, the 
Health Sciences Center Bookstore and 
the Levin College of Law Bookstore. 
  Students will be allowed to high-
light and write in these rented books without being penalized, said Lynne 
Vaughan, director of UF bookstores. 
  However, if the books are damaged, 
or returned late, students will be penal-
ized, Vaughan said. If books aren’t re-
turned at all, students will pay 75 per-
cent of what the book would cost new.
  Students who want to use the pro-gram must create a rental proﬁ  le on 
www.rent-a-text.com, Vaughan said. 
When students go to the bookstore to rent, all of their information is already in the system.
  But, not all books will be available 
for rent, said Jerry Meriwether, assis-tant director of business services di-vision of UF. He said there are about 1,000 titles available to rent at the mo-
ment. 
  He also said advantages include 
cutting down on shipping fees for stu-
dents. Offering this service on cam-
pus allows students to save time and 
money by not packaging and returning unwanted books, he said. 
  Books must be returned to the same 
location they came from and by the last 
day of ﬁ  nals that semester. 
  Eligible students can rent up to 
$500 worth of books each semester, 
Vaughan said.
Along with ﬁ  nancial aid, students 
can pay for rentals with a credit card, debit card, by check or with cash.   Deferment program

On the day Santa Fe College 
art student Sarah Ludwig moved 
from the house she had rented 
for the past year, she wondered which she liked more, the stuffed swordfish or the electric organ.
In the end, the swordfish won.
This past weekend, Lud-
wig wedged, pummeled and 
crammed 20 years worth of stuff into boxes and bags ready to be 
moved when her lease ended. At 
the end of the day, she had piled her life into a mountain of brown boxes the size of two refrigerators side by side.
“I generally like to make sure 
that I can handle all of my stuff by myself.” Ludwig said. “But it was still so much stuff. I couldn’t 
understand it.”
Ludwig is not the only person 
to be sweating and scrambling to 
move out. From late July through the month of August, the pres-
sure of moving can be felt all over 
Gainesville, as many renters find themselves with expiring leases.
“I hate moving.” said Phil 
Dalton, 21, whose father had to drive to the city of Archer to rent 
a U-Haul truck. “It’s annoying. I 
had to bring boxes from work for about a week just so I could have enough time to pack everything.”
This past weekend, the rumble 
of moving trucks, the smell of overflowing dumpsters and the peeling of duct tape overtook a 
city in the midst of a transition. 
Armed with mops and brooms and backed by friends and family 
from out of town, students  and 
non-students alike felt the throttle of moving their stuff, discarding what was no longer valuable and 
acclimating themselves to their 
new neighborhood.Some, like Santa Fe student 
Jordan Streetzel, 20, signed a lease for the first time.
“I’ve been spending a year 
and a half collecting cute stuff or 
anything that could go on a wall 
and plotting what I was going to do with all my space,” Streetzel 
said.
Streetzel, who has been living 
in Gainesville since last October 
by paying rent under the table 
and occasionally crashing on a 
friends’ couch, said moving gives her hope for a new start.
Others — like UF students Lisa 
Ferrera, 22, who moved all her 
stuff in the rain, or Brian Green-
field, 22, who bemoaned losing valuable study time to clean out his refrigerator –  don’t have such 
a positive outlook. 
Realtor Bob Mitchell, whose 
has managed  properties around 
Gainesville for 21 years, said this weekend is always his most mis-
erable.
Landlords, rental companies 
and property owners find this 
time of year to be one of the most 
exhausting, he said.
“We work long hours into the 
night cleaning up houses, paint-
ing walls, hauling garbage, what-ever it takes,” Mitchell said. “It’s 
miserable, but that is the nature 
of the beast.”
For Ludwig, the only beast she 
knows is stuffed and hanging on 
the wall of her new home.
“The stuffed swordfish was a 
good idea,” Ludwig said. “I got it 
out of the trash and I’m so happy. Moving day is awesome.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 2010

� A GRAY SWASTIKA WAS PAINTED 
ON A HOUSE BELONGING TO ALPHA EPSILON PI IN APRIL 2009.
By JORDAN DIAZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
A gray swastika spray-painted on a UF 
fraternity house last year made national 
news this week when the Anti-Defamation League released its 2009 Audit of Anti-Se-mitic Incidents.
The league listed the UF incident along-
side other acts of vandalism around the 
country, including rocks thrown through 
a synagogue’s window, KKK graffiti dis-covered in a synagogue’s parking lot after Passover and a burning cross placed inside a Jewish education center.
Members of the traditionally Jewish 
fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi discovered the swastika on April 2, 2009 and reported the incident to University Police on April 5, according to Alligator archives. At near-ly 8,000 Jewish students, UF has one the highest Jewish enrollment rates in the na-
tion, according to UF Hillel.
The report, released on 
July 27, found that the num-
ber of anti-Semitic incidents in 2009 remained at a “sus-
tained and troubling” level for both the United States and Florida, even with the total number incidents decreasing  from 1,352 to 1,211.The audit separates acts of anti-Sem-
itism into three categories: physical as-saults, vandalism and harassment.  
Florida had a total of 90 incidents in 
2009, down from 122 last year. Harass-ment accounted for 63. There were 24 cas-es of vandalism and 3 physical assaults, according to the audit.  In 2008, there were 
71 cases of harassment and 46 cases of van-
dalism in Florida, according to 2008 audit. The League also found an increase in anti-Semitism online.

Adu-Brempong has been living with relatives since leaving Shands
that Stump will be out of her office until 
Thursday.
According to Sikes, UPD is placing 
an emphasis on improving relationships 
between officers, students and faculty. 
Another program Stump hopes to em-
phasize, she said, is Student Community Oriented Policing Effort.
The program assigns UPD officers to 
specific sections of campus they regularly patrol. This, she said, allows the officers 
to become familiar with the students and 
faculty in that area and to know how to 
deal with situations better.
“We want to make sure people know 
there are efforts to bring students and of-ficers together,” she said.
Adu-Brempong has been living with 
local relatives since his release from 
Shands at UF in early May, according to his civil attorney Bill Hoppe.
Although he no longer requires con-
stant medical attention, he still has a long 
way to go before reaching the end of his 
recovery, Hoppe said.
Adu-Brempong’s injuries are exten-
sive. The bullet that pierced his face blew out his upper palate and some of his 
teeth. 
According to Hoppe, there are shat-
tered remnants of teeth lodged in his mouth. He will undergo reconstructive surgery and receive a replacement pal-
ate and set of teeth in hopes of repairing some of his speech.A second bullet remains stuck in his 
vertebrae, Hoppe said, as doctors said it would be more dangerous to try to re-move it than to leave it.
Adu-Brempong was also shot in the 
right hand, which resulted in partial loss 
of motion, Hoppe said.
Despite Adu-Brempong’s injuries, 
Hoppe said the grad student is recover-ing quite well.
“It’s now five months today, and he’s 
doing as well as could be expected,” he 
said. “I’m very positive and he’s very positive about his future.”
Adu-Brempong continues to go to 
counseling as part of his court mandates, 
he said. If he continues to go for the next 
three years, his charges of aggravated as-
sault and resisting arrest with violence will be dropped.
Hoppe said this should present no 
problems as long as he stays on current 
medications.
“His goal is to recover, and when he 
has recovered sufficiently, to complete his doctorate at the University of Flori-
da,” Hoppe said.In June, the news that Adu-Brem-
pong’s charges were deferred came as 
good news to more than just him and his family. 
Concerned students and community 
members had been calling for the charg-
es to be dropped since the shooting oc-
curred. For Adu-Brempong, a deferred sentence means that as long as he keeps 
going to counseling sessions, his charges 
will be dropped.
Dave Schneider, a third-year history 
and political science major, organized three rallies in spring demanding, among 
other things, the charges be dropped and 
a board of citizens and students review 
UPD protocol.
“Our position all along was that [drop-
ping the charges] was the most important demand,” he said. “That happening was 
very fulfilling for the campaign.”
However, he said, there is still much 
to be upset about, mainly the reinstate-
ment of the officers involved.
“It’s still a massive injustice that the 
police were not publicly reprimanded or 
charged,” he said. 
Schneider said his group, Justice for 
Kofi Adu-Brempong, will now turn its attention to making sure the SG-recom-mended review board will have actual power to influence UPD policy.
The proposed advisory committee 
cannot investigate police conduct or de-termine discipline because the Police Of-ficer Bill of Rights prohibits it, according 
to an official UF statement.KOFI , from page 1Events surrounding the Kofi 
Adu-Brempong shooting on March 2
� Adu-Brempong had been exhibiting mentally disturbed 
behavior days before the incident, police said.
� A neighbor heard screaming from Adu-Brempong’s 
on-campus Corry Village apartment, according to police reports. 
� Adu-Brempong would not allow police officers into his 
apartment, police said.
� Peter Waylen, Adu-Brempong’s colleague in the 
Department of Geography, attempted to assist police in talking with Adu-Brempong. � Officers talked to him through an open window for about two-and-a-half hours before he fell silent, police reports said.  
� The officers forced their way into the apartment, they said, because they feared Adu-Brempong had harmed himself. 
� The reports said Adu-Brempong approached the      
officers with a metal table leg.
� They fired two Tasers, which failed to connect, four 
rounds of bean-bag shots, which failed to subdue him, and two shots from an AR-15 rifle, which struck his face and hand. 
� Adu-Brempong was taken to Shands at UF, where he 
was admitted as a patient under an alias.“His goal is to recover, and 
when he has recovered suffi -
ciently, to complete his doctor -
ate at the University of Florida.”

Today’s question: Would you 
want to hang with the “Jersey Shore” cast?
100 TOTAL VOTES31% YES69% NOThursday’s question: Have you ever drawn graffiti on anything?Moving Pains
Couches line the side-walks, particle boards disintegrate on the 
curb and Dumpsters full of rain-soaked mattresses wait to be emptied. It’s that time of year again — moving from one place to the next. The worst part about it: the unrelenting fees Gainesville Regional Utilities imposes on customers.
It costs $60 to switch ser-
vice from one place to an-other and $70 if you’re acti-vating utilities under a new person — costing enough to 
keep temperatures at a liv-
able level this time of year. It’s a racket.
The fees would be funny 
if we weren’t paying for them. They itemize $10 of that $70 fee as “activating” curbside trash pickup. They don’t even drop off a shiny new trash can.The power was never 
turned off at any of our places between switches in tenets. Perhaps the only reason any GRU employee would trek out to any of our houses or apartments is to give the meter a final read and bill us for the partial month. Apparently, the ex-tra trip to transfer services costs $60 more than when they do the same thing ev-ery month.
It all adds up, making it 
clear that Gainesville needs a competing energy provid-
er to keep our beloved GRU 
in check. Without some sort of competition, GRU’s ri-diculous rates and fees can only get worse.
Until then, we’re willing 
to pitch in on a miles-long extension cord to span from our houses to Clay Electric territory.
We can all relate to ‘Jersey Shore’ cast
Jersey Shore: Two words that ignite controversy, You-
Tube impersonations and fist pumps.
Here’s the situation: In May, Us Weekly Magazine 
asked me to interview the eight self-proclaimed “guidos” and “guidettes” who have taken over Seaside Heights, N.J., Miami Beach and the world.  
Interview the cast that pulled in 4.8 million viewers for 
season one’s finale? “Of course,” I ecstatically agreed.
Suddenly, flashbacks from prior episodes flooded my 
mind. Would they be obnoxious? Ostentatious? Orange?
I called my dad as I drove to their digs at the Metropole 
Hotel. I was looking for some reassurance, maybe some 
comfort. Instead, he warned me, “Don’t get punched in 
the face like Smoochie.”
“Snooki, Dad. It’s Snooki.” Even my father, going on 
50, is aware of this MTV phenomenon.
Nevertheless, I arrived on Collins Avenue with my in-
terview questions and recorder in hand. I spent two days with the gang. Day One I spent at their house and Day Two at Dream Nightclub for a photo shoot. Through one-on-one interviews with the cast, I became well-acquainted 
with these tanning titans.
Mike “The Situation” is beyond obsessed with his abs. If 
he could walk around shirtless 24 hours a day, he would. 
Ronnie and Sam stay away from one another — and by 
the looks of the season two premiere and previews, I can 
understand why. 
Pauly D loves his blow-out haircut as much as Mike 
loves his abs. So I had to ask him, “If you had to get rid of your blow-out and were to get a mullet, shave your 
head or get a Mohawk, which one would you choose?” 
Mohawk—because of the spikes.
Angelina is out to prove herself to the cast and to the public. She’s a very open indi-vidual and unafraid to share her opinions of her roommates.
Vinny is down to earth and 
laid-back. He has ambitions to be a lawyer — but not right now. Look out Levin College of Law.
Snooki is kind and smiley. “I’ve never partied so much 
in my life!” she told Us, with a tall pouf atop her head. “I actually shocked myself, and I scared myself. I partied for two months straight!” said the petite, pickle-loving party girl.
JWoWW smokes a cigarette following our second inter-
view. She no longer has the blonde extensions from season one, and she’s prettier in person. The rough chick asks me if I grew up in South Florida. 
It’s the first time I’m answering questions instead of 
asking them. We talk for a minute before she is called away for photos. During the group shots, an MTV staffer turns to me, exhausted from the long day of media and pictures. She notes the ‘Shore’ stars are “good kids,” and by the vibe of the photo shoot, I can tell she means it.
These eight 20-something-year-olds may not be role 
models, but they are people. And while TV is saturated with reality shows, dramatic reenactments and formulaic episodes, these kids are doing what they do best — being 
themselves.
I’m not advocating violence, promiscuous smushing 
(sex) with grenades (unattractive females), or binge drink-
ing Ron Ron Juice (a combination of watermelon juice, cherries, cranberry juice and vodka), but as for being gen-
uinely real — well, I can fist pump to that.
Hilary Sheinbaum is a UF alumna. She graduated in April 
with a degree in public relations.It happened: Bernie Machen won, and Georgia beat us. 
The Bulldogs are now ranked as the No. 1 party school in the nation, while UF has slipped to seventh place after 
taking the top spot two years ago.
We cut out that last beer of the night so we could sober up 
and drive home. We got worried about calories and started drinking six nights a week instead of seven. We started tak-ing our classes too seriously and stayed in during finals in-stead of winging it.
What a tough lesson in reality. We, as a student body, let 
our guard down and UGA didn’t waste a second stealing the crown away from us.
Who would have thought that the only other school with 
an invite to the World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party 
would end up stripping us of our honor?
We used to be the best at something, and now we’re noth-
ing more than second fiddle to one of our conference rivals. 
We wouldn’t accept this kind of performance from our foot-ball team, so how can we accept this for ourselves?
And to think, Machen is probably reclining in his desk 
chair, smoking a cigar and laughing at our misfortune. We think he was colluding with the Bulldogs the entire time — once he realized we were an unstoppable force, he probably went to Athens and publicly encouraged them to start drink-ing more.
In fact, this all seems fishy to us. Think about the recent 
rash of underage drinking problems and the DUI on the football team. Who’s paying off the Princeton Review? That stigma, er, honor is ours, and we deserved to get it again this year.Party Pooper
UF falls to No. 7 in party 
school rankings

Speaking OutTUESDAY, AUGUST 3, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Simply being an American citizen comes 
with a grab bag of freedoms and benefits. Social Security, education, welfare and 
President Obama’s soon-to-be-implemented comprehensive health care system are only 
some of the fruits of our nation’s wealth - a 
wealth built on the social and ethnic diversity that defines America. While this diversity is our nation’s greatest strength, we cannot al-low unrestrained access to America’s limited bounty. I am writing in regards to SB1070, the Arizona law causing so much uproar – the one that allows police officers to detain suspected illegal immigrants unless they are carrying 
immigration documents. I’ve heard the words 
“un-American,” “fascist,” “xenophobic” and “racist” all used to describe this legislation and its supporters, and I have never been more worried for the future of America.
In an age when many students’ only news 
comes from tweets and hearsay, our opinions are quickly growing more uninformed and thus more asinine. Our refusal to seek objec-
tive journalism has left us with less and less 
exposure to the unbiased facts that allow us to form our own opinions. Instead, we pas-sionately regurgitate the twisted opinions of partisan bloggers and talking heads. SB1070 was created in response to chronic failures by the federal government to secure our borders against the overwhelming influx of illegal immigrants. The residents of Arizona have a 
right to protect their own interests in light of 
our national government’s inability to do so. In fact, the failure to control illegal immigra-tion has fueled a dangerous and despicable human-trafficking trade that preys on the desperation of people who come here seeking a better life.
As an American citizen and tax payer, I 
pay a hefty portion of my income into Social Security, and I pay for my health insurance. In return, I expect to receive the associated ben-efits I have earned from hard work. Illegal im-migrants sneak into the country undocument-ed and then drain American social systems – Social Security, health care, food stamps, 
education. They receive the same benefits as 
American citizens, only they pay nothing for 
it, adding a monetary strain that keeps many 
legal Americans from enjoying the same ben-
efits. The industry surrounding illegal hu-man trafficking is even more detrimen-tal: Police raids on these operations have 
turned up illegal automatic weapons, forged 
documents, hard drugs and even prostitution 
rings. The illegal immigrants are often abused or even sold into what is essentially slavery, an outcome that benefits no one except the traffickers themselves.
While I agree the Arizona law does open 
the door to potential overuse by authorities, I do not concede that its terms are unreason-able. The average American’s wallet contains 
a driver’s license, multiple credit cards, a 
debit card, insurance certificates and numer-ous other documents. What’s one more piece of paper? Upon questioning by an officer, an American citizen accused of being an illegal immigrant would simply present proof of citizenship and be on her way. No person will be deported because he “fits the profile.” He will be deported because he cannot prove he 
is in America legally, an extraordinarily easy 
thing for a person to do if he is lawfully in the United States. In an age when American citizens are recruited as terrorists, and immi-grants seeking their own American dream are enslaved by human traffickers, perhaps it is time for all U.S. citizens to carry documenta-tion stating they are here legally and have un-dergone extensive background screening – a 
sort of “fast pass” for legal justice.
As a student paying for college with schol-
arships and a part-time job, I have no sympa-
thy for any person of any nationality (includ-ing American) trying to steal from the social systems that enable me to go to school and re-ceive medical care when I need it. To general-ize those who share my opinion as being racist 
or xenophobic is startlingly offensive. Being 
un-American means not taking a stand and defending America when it is being abused. People with the dream of being Americans should have a legitimate, legal way to become tax-paying, productive citizens who enjoy all the fruits of our nation. Ignoring America’s 
illegal immigration problem benefits neither 
those who wish to become Americans nor 
those who are already here and pay dearly to 
support our way of life.

Speaking OutBurn Quran Day is unchristian
As a Christian, I follow a basic 
commandment: Love one another 
as you love yourself. This does not mean love your Christian neighbors, and bully all others. It definitely does 
not mean that it is acceptable, in the 
name of Christ, to persecute those of another faith.  On Sept. 11,  The Dove World Outreach Center is planning an “International Burn a Quran Day.”  They describe Islam as “a religion of the devil” and have been mobilizing using Facebook and YouTube to per-suade others to their cause.  
Terry and Sylvia Jones are the se-
nior pastors of The Dove World Out-reach Center. Their website, www.doveworld.org shares the history and mission of their church. Among the messages of hate against Muslims, are also messages of hate for homo-sexual partnerships. To Terry and Sylvia Jones: I am ashamed to call you 
a brother and sister. Your message of 
hate and bigotry is another twisting of a faith based on love and compas-sion for all people. You fashion my faith into a sword, and I will not stay silent.
I am a Christian woman, and I am 
saying enough. Not in the name of my Christ., not in the name of my God 
and not in my name will such an act 
ever be acceptable. I am asking mem-bers of Dove World Outreach Center to search their consciences and re-consider this act of hate. This is not in keeping with the teachings of Christ.  
Christian men and women: We 
have a voice, and we are powerful only when we use it. Search your heart 
and find a way to support healing for 
our world. Peace comes at a cost of reaching across the border to some-one who may look different from you, who may worship differently from you and finding a common ground from which to build a friendship. No more shall we allow acts of hatred in the name of our savior, Jesus Christ. To my inter-faith sisters and brothers, 
I am sorry. I dream of a time when it 
will no longer be a world torn by war, but, rather, a world gathered together to learn from and cherish the precious gifts each of us has to offer.

Adu-Brempong shooting 
investigation isn’t transparent
When the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement report cleared the 
five officers involved in the Kofi  Adu-Brempong shooting we were upset but believed an internal investigation 
might bring about some disciplinary 
action. Now it seems UPD has rein-stated all but one of the officers in-volved in the shooting with no actions taken against them. Maybe there was a slap on the wrist for mishandling the situation, but we don’t know. 
We don’t know because they acted 
on the findings of the investigation 
without releasing it to the public. How 
can an investigation be ongoing, but the results implemented? UPD has kept the public out of this situation since the beginning. The Kofi shoot-ing shouldn’t have been handled be-hind closed doors. If we had a campus police review board this information would be made available to the public 
every step of the way, and the officers’ 
rights to due process would still be protected. 
The administration and UPD as-
sured us justice would be transpar-ent, but we only see the shady actions based on an internal investigation.

� The Gators will begin training camp on Aug. 5. No 
practices will be open to the public or media. Last sea -
son two of them were open for people to attend and 
watch. FSU, Alabama, Georgia, LSU and Ohio State will close off their training camps this season too.TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG 2010 JIM THORPE AWARD UF FOOTBALL� SIX CHARITIES WERE REPRESENTED.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
With two-a-day practices and the start of another gru-
eling season on the horizon, the Gators took some time to 
have fun and give back to the community.
About 1,000 fans filed into Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to 
watch UF football players compete in strength and agility 
drills in the third annual Gators Charity Challenge.
“It wasn’t so much of a workout as it was an opportu-
nity for them to get in front of the fans,” said Scott Holsop-ple, the assistant director of strength and conditioning.
The competition helped raise money for six different 
local charity organizations: March of Dimes, STOP! Chil-
dren’s Cancer, Inc., American Cancer Society, Shands 
Cancer Hospital, American Heart Association and the Ronald McDonald House Charities.
The players were divided into six teams – each one 
represented a different organization. Duke Lemmens, Lorenzo Edwards, Brandon Antwine, Ahmad Black, Ter-ron Sanders and A.J. Jones were named captains as each squad wore different colored shirts.
But in the end Edwards’ team, which represented 
STOP! Children’s Cancer, Inc., came out on top after com-peting in an obstacle course, farmer’s hold, sled push and tug of war contest.
“This is the fun stuff, this isn’t the hard stuff,” Lem-
mens said. “This is what we worked out all summer for – to show off our muscles to everybody.”
Jeff Demps, who ran the fastest 100-meter dash in the 
world earlier this year, did not run the top time in the obstacle course event. As he attempted to make a cut, his cleats gave way and he slipped before he could reach the end of the course.Wide receiver Andre Debose and defensive tackle Shar-
rif Floyd were among the players that didn’t take part in the event because they had to make a trip home before practice started on Thursday.“Tonight shows you the energy we have,” Lemmens 
said. “We really came out for a cause. This isn’t about us, it’s about the charities and I think we did a good job rep-resenting them.”
Gators flex muscles for charities at annual event  
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF players competed in strength and agility drills to help raise money for six different local charities. The team rep -
resenting STOP! Children’s Cancer, Inc., led by linebacker Lorenzo Edwards, won the event.
The Southeastern Conference just got 
tougher and deeper.
Former Oregon quarterback Jer-
emiah Masoli, who was kicked off the team in June for legal troubles, will be taking his 
talents south this fall and joining Houston 
Nutt’s Ole Miss team for the upcoming sea-son.
Masoli will have to join the team as a 
walk-on, since the Rebels already have 85 players on scholarship, but the quarterback that led Oregon to a Pac-10 title – and the Rose Bowl berth that came with it – will be 
battling for the starting position with sopho-
more Nathan Stanley.
But let’s be real, a quarterback of Maso-
li’s stature and proven worth is sure to be under center for Ole Miss by the time the season kicks off in September.
If – rather, when Masoli wins the starting 
job, it means one thing for the SEC.
The conference that is widely argued as 
the best in the land now has an argument for the best quarterback conference in the NCAA.
That’s saying 
something, con-sidering the two quarterbacks that 
were named to 
the All-SEC pre-season first and second teams before last sea-son are now in 
the NFL – former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow and former Ole Miss play-caller Je-
van Snead (who many considered a Heis-
man darkhorse prior to the season).
With Masoli walking on to play at Ole 
Miss, he instantly becomes the second-best quarterback in the conference this season behind Arkansas’ Ryan Mallett. And that’s without Masoli ever taking a snap for the Rebels.

If the gorgeous facilities weren’t 
enough, the Florida lacrosse program just gained some additional street cred. 
Head coach Amanda O’Leary an-
nounced last week that Caitlyn McFad-
den, the reigning two-time ACC Player 
of the Year, NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player and recent National Champion, will be a new assistant la-crosse coach for the Gators. 
“This is a slam dunk hire,” O’Leary said. “Caitlyn is one of the most decorat-
ed lacrosse players ever and is the epito-
me of a successful student-athlete.” 
McFadden, a current member of the 
United States Wom-en’s Lacrosse National Team, captained the 2010 Maryland Ter-rapins which won the national title and just 
concluded a decorated career that saw her claim numerous accolades includ-ing All-American honors and female UF hires reigning ACC 
Player of the Year

� In celebration of “Shark Week,” ESPN should just run shows 
dealing with sports agents for all seven days. ... Redskins DT Albert 
Haynesworth is being held out of practice because he can’t run 300 yards in 70 seconds. Coach Mike Shanahan is just mad a man in worse shape than him is getting paid two times as much as he is.� UF cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety 
Will Hill were named to the 2010 Jim Thorpe preseason watch list on Monday. They were among 35 of the nation’s top defensive backs to make the list.

“As a player, I was fortunate 
enough to be part of a national 
championship team and I know the amount of dedication and hard 
work that it takes to get there,” Mc-
Fadden said.  
McFadden’s hiring came on the 
heels of the departure of assistant coach Jennifer Ulehla. With a spot to fill, UF jumped at the chance for an impactful hire. 
“We looked at all the options 
available and Caitlyn’s name kept 
popping up,” O’Leary said. “Every-
one said great things about her and I met with her at a tournament we were both at. She was very interest-ed. UF was an easy sell.” 
Despite her youth, McFadden’s 
transition from player to coach will come very easy to her, O’Leary said. 
“It is a different dynamic,” 
O’Leary said. “But it is all about respect. Our players have seen her play. They’ve seen her work ethic, commitment and determination. She’ll command respect.” 
McFadden is no newbie to coach-
ing, as she has worked camps across the country since 2007. 
The Phoenix, Md., native worked 
as an instructor for Elevate Lacrosse Camps and Maximum Exposure 
Lacrosse Camps. She also conduct-
ed youth camps with the National Team. 
Coach O’Leary referred to Mc-
Fadden as a “student of the game” and said she will be involved in all aspects of coaching. 
Innovative offensive and defen-
sive schemes are just some of the things McFadden will bring to the 
UF lacrosse program. O’Leary also 
said recruiting will be impacted by the hire. 
“Every kid knows who Caitlyn 
McFadden is,” O’Leary said. “The name recognition will certainly help us because who wouldn’t want to come and be coached by one of the best players in the country.”egon, Masoli threw for 2,147 yards and 15 touchdowns while connecting on 58 percent of his passes. He also ran for 668 yards and 13 scores for the Ducks.
The only quarterback in the SEC that dwarfs Masoli’s out-
put is Mallett, who last season threw for 3,627 yards and 30 touchdowns, compared to just seven interceptions, while com-
pleting 56 percent of his passes.
But behind those two quarterbacks, the SEC still has plenty 
of talent.
What does it say about the depth in the conference that 
arguably the third-best quarterback in the SEC is the one that 
guided his team to a BCS title last year?
In fact, it’s even hard to put Alabama’s Greg McElroy at 
third on the SEC’s list, though I give him the slight nod over UF’s new quarterback John Brantley, only because everything 
we know about Brantley is based on limited game experience 
and the potential he has.
Brantley is probably more gifted than McElroy, and could 
end up higher on this list by the time the season is over, but based on what we’ve seen on the field, McElroy (2,508 yards and 17 touchdowns en route to an undefeated 2009 campaign) should be the third-best quarterback in the conference.
Now, add in South Carolina’s Stephen Garcia, new Auburn 
quarterback Cam Newton and LSU’s Jordan Jefferson.
Garcia showed improvement as a sophomore while throw-
ing for 2.862 yards and 17 touchdowns, but needs to cut down on the mistakes (10 interceptions in 2009) and Newton was Tim Tebow-lite in his limited time at UF before being kicked off the team for stealing a laptop.
With those seven names from 12 teams, it’s evident the SEC 
has the most depth at quarterback of any conference.O’Leary expects hire to help recruiting

This might be the Broncos’ year.
After finishing with an undefeated re-
cord in two of the past four seasons, Boise State still could not punch a ticket to the BCS national championship game because of its weak conference.
But that could be a non-issue this time 
around. With the Broncos returning every starter on offense and 11 out of the 12 on defense from last year, they are expected to rank high in the preseason polls.
Which is why Boise State comes in at 
No. 2 in the alligatorSports’ college football preseason poll.
The only starter not coming back is cor-
nerback Kyle Wilson, who was drafted by 
the New York Jets in the first round.
Other than Wilson, every starter is re-
turning from a team that finished its season 
with a perfect record  and ended its year 
with a victory over then-undefeated TCU 
in the Fiesta Bowl.
Quarterback Kellen Moore, who threw 
for 3,536 yards and 39 touchdowns last year, returns with the same cast that put up 
42.2 points per game last season.
That includes two all-conference receiv-
ers in Austin Pettis and Titus Young, who 
will be back to help Moore in the passing 
game, and the two-headed monster in the backfield (Jeremy Avery and Doug Martin) 
which totaled 1,986 rushing yards last sea-son.
The offensive line, which only allowed 
five sacks last year, will return all five of its start-ers and will be the catalyst 
to the success of Moore 
and the running game.
The defense does lose 
an All-Western Athletic Conference cornerback in 
Wilson, but junior Jerrell 
Gavins from Miami is expected to fill the 
void. 
However, the front seven, which tallied
