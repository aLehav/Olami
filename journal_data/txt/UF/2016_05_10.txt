HIS CURRENT TRESPASS NOTICE 
WILL EXPIRE IN OCTOBER 2018.
By Giuseppe Sabella
Alligator Staff Writer
On April 22, about three weeks after 
Manuel Vasquez pleaded no contest to a 
charge of video voyeurism, the former UF 
Department of Religion chairman submit-
ted his resignation.
Three days later, 
Vasquez said he intended to clear his ofﬁ  ce by May 
8, UF spokeswoman Ja-
nine Sikes wrote in an email. 
His last day of work 
was May 1, and the cur-
rent trespass notice against Vasquez will expire Oct. 23, 2018, she wrote.
Sheriff’s deputies arrested Vasquez in 
October 2015 after they said he placed a camera in his daughter’s closet and se-cretly videotaped her in 2014, according to Alligator archives. She was 14 years old at the time. 
The daughter’s friend, who was also 
underage, found the camera and viewed its collection of seven videos. One video showed the daughter topless, wearing only 
underwear.
Eighth Judicial Circuit Judge Mark 
Moseley sentenced Vasquez to ﬁ  ve years 
of probation April 7, according to Alachua County court records. 
He is required to undergo at least 30 
months of counseling and to avoid minors and pornographic materials, among other special conditions, according to the re-
cords.
Vasquez served UF as an associate pro-
fessor for 12 years before he became a full 
professor in 2011, according to Alligator archives. He took the chair position in 
2012. 
As a vested former employee, Sikes 
wrote, Vasquez is still entitled to any con-
tribution the university made to his retire-
ment account.

Casual strollers and serious cyclists now 
have a safe trail to take from Bo Diddley Plaza in downtown Gainesville all the way through to I-75 on Archer Road.
After seven years of planning, two years 
of construction and $4 million, the 2.5-mile UF portion of the trail was ﬁ  nished and cel-ebrated with a ribbon-cutting and bike ride May 7. 
“This new trail connects all the (current) 
city bike trails,” said Linda Dixon, the di-rector of planning at UF’s Planning, Design and Construction Division, “and there’s plans to keep expanding.”
The trail connects the downtown Gainesville and Archer segments of what will one day be a bike trail across Alachua 
County, going all the way from the town of 
Hawthorne, Florida, to the town of Archer, 
Florida, she said. 
The idea for the trail was ﬁ  rst thought of 
in 1994, but it wasn’t ofﬁ  cially planned un-til 2009. This segment of the trail has been 
in design since 2012, and it is one of the 
ﬁ  rst bike trails to get national funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
Two days before the ofﬁ  cial opening of 
the UF Campus Greenway, Zagster, a Bos-
ton-based bike rental company, started its 
pilot program for bike rentals and sharing in Gainesville.
There are 16 bikes in total available 
at two rental stations — eight bikes at Bo Diddley Plaza and eight bikes at Innova-tion Square — in downtown Gainesville. 
According to Zagster’s website, a monthly 
membership is $15 and an annual member-
ship is $25. These memberships make bike 
trips under one hour free. Otherwise, bike 
rides are $3 per hour.
Cyclists can use a phone app or receive 
text messages to electronically track how long their rides are, view the cost of the rides and lock the bikes. When they ﬁ  nish riding, customers return the bikes to either 
of the rental stations.
“The code changes (electronically) with 
each new ride,” said Keli Hoyt-Rupert, Zag-
ster’s customer success manager, “so we’re not really worried about someone stealing UF portion of cross-county bike trail 
opens, links downtown to Archer Road

Wyoming judge facing ouster 
over stance on same-sex mar-riage 
CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Some current and former Wyoming lawmakers as well as national religious groups are supporting 
a municipal judge who faces a 
dismissal petition before the Wyoming Supreme Court for saying she would not preside over same-sex marriages.The Wyoming Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics is recommending the court re-move Municipal Judge and Circuit Court Magistrate Ruth Neely of Pinedale. The commis-sion started investigating Neely after she told a reporter in 2014 she would not perform same-sex marriages because of her religious beliefs.Attempts to reach Neely and her attorneys, including the Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona religious advocacy law firm, were not successful Monday.Neely is fighting removal, ar-guing she has a constitutional right to voice her opinion. Her 
lawyers have said no same-sex 
couples have asked her to pre-
side over their weddings.
In a similar case, Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, a born-again 
Christian, was jailed briefly last 
year after she refused to allow 
her office to issue marriage li-
censes, igniting a national de-bate over religious freedom and 
civil rights. Davis ultimately al-
tered the licenses to remove her 
name and title.In a response to the removal petition, Neely's lawyers stated 
in a court filing last month that 
removing her would violate her 
rights. They quoted a provision of the Wyoming Constitution which prohibits the state from 
finding a person incompetent 
to hold public office, "because 
of his opinion on any matter of religious belief whatever."

At first, Adam Tritt said he 
never planned to memorialize the 
murder of five students in the Fall 
of 1990.
“There were little memorials 
all over town — flowers here, 
candles there, and we figured 
we’d put a memorial in one spot 
that was easy to get to, that was central, and that was the whole idea,” he said. 
When he decided to paint a 
mural on the 34th Street Wall, Tritt said he never expected it to last.
“I was flabbergasted when it 
was there a year later,” he said. “I was dumbfounded when they got actual permission to put a frame around it.”
On April 30, at least one un-
identified person marked the memorial with a white swas-tika within an existing red heart. A pair of white SS bolts were 
sprayed next to the heart. 
The memorial honors Sonja 
Larson, Christina Powell, Christa 
Hoyt, Manuel Taboada and Tracy Paules, all of whom Danny Roll-
ing killed in August 1990.
Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said GPD re-
ceives a few calls about the wall each year. 
Painting the wall, he said, is 
still considered illegal, but the de-partment has an unspoken rule to not prosecute people for doing so. 
“Even if they were painting a 
picture of sunshine and rainbows it would still be an act of criminal 
mischief if we followed the abso-
lute letter of the Florida law and, over the past, law enforcement 
agencies have chosen to let that 
wall serve as a place for artists and for people to display graffiti,” he said. 
Police are not allowed to paint 
the wall, even to cover especially offensive vandalism, Tobias said. 
As of press time, the symbols were covered in a fresh coat of 
black paint. It is unclear who is 
responsible for maintaining the memorial. 
The recent vandalism, Tobias 
said, is an insult to the city. 
“For somebody to want to do 
something that egregious in a public space is just embarrass-ing,” he said. 
Tritt said he never met the stu-
dents Rollings murdered, but he still decided to create the memo-rial with his friend Paul Chase.
“We were poor; we were 
broke,” Tritt said. “We took one scooter to Wal-Mart, and we got the gallons of paint that were left over because they were mixed 
badly and they couldn’t sell 
them.” 
The students’ families planted 
five trees in the nearby median, each adorned with a student’s 
name, for the 10th anniversary of 
their murders.
Tritt said most people have 
no idea why the memorial exists, 
and those who do may still van-
dalize it. 
“There’s assholes every-
where,” he said.

Out of 800 universities, Times 
Higher Education ranked UF as No. 
120 this year in its World Univer-sity Rankings list.
Each year, the organization an-
nounces the top 100 universities it considers to be the best. Rankings are based on four areas: teaching, research, international outlook and knowledge transfer.
Although UF missed the top 100 
by 20 spots, the university’s rank-ing increased by six spots since last year.
Florida State University was the 
second Florida university to come in, placing at No. 213. 
The increase in UF’s ranking is 
in large part due to the rise of re-search.
According to Joe Kays, the di-
rector of research communications at UF, research rose about 300 per-
cent over the past 20 years.
“We’ve really made a commit-
ment to grow our research enter-
prise,” he said, “because we’re so interdisciplinary, someone in medi-cine can easily partner with some-one in agriculture and so forth.”
Kays said UF received $706.8 
million in research awards for the ﬁ  scal year of 2015, which has gone up from the $519 million the uni-versity received 10 years ago.
UF health science senior Mag-
gie Holzworth has done research in the division of nephrology, the study of kidneys, for almost a year now.
The 20-year-old said her favor-
ite part about research is applying what she’s learned in classes to 
real life situations.
“Since I want to pursue pri-
mary care medicine, the ability to 
do research at school is an amaz-ing opportunity,” Holzworth said. “I know that I’m getting the best education in the state.”
Kays said performing well in 
rankings is nice, but that it’s not 
what drives the university.
“Each individual scientist is 
driven by his or her own curios-
ity and area of expertise,” he said. “We’re focused on doing the best research we can in the areas we have the greatest strengths.”UF ranked in top 15th 
percentile by Times Higher Education

College students seeking to emp-
ty or furnish their apartments often 
visit thrift stores at the start of a new 
semester.
This summer, students can do-
nate their gently used furniture or 
clothes, ﬁ  nd deals and help local charities at nonproﬁ  t thrift stores around town. 
The Junior League of Gainesville 
thrift store, which runs primarily on volunteers, will have deals for stu-dents all summer. The sales include events such as “Fill A Bag,” where 
customers receive a bag and ﬁ  ll it 
with as many items as possible for a certain price, said store manager Sherry Peters.
“We don’t always tell people 
about the sales,” she said. “It’s more fun that way.”
All of the proﬁ  ts beneﬁ  t more 
than 100 charities, Peters said.
The Family Treasures Thrift 
Shop, which beneﬁ  ts the Children’s Home Society of Florida, has sales every week, said store manager Burt Polansky. 
“Our prices rock,” he said. “We 
sold an all-wooden bedroom set for $1,200, and it’s probably worth $6,000.” 
Haven Hospice Attic Resale Store 
is another nonproﬁ  t thrift shop, and 
it beneﬁ  ts Haven Hospice.
Students can drop off donations 
at the store, located at 300 NW Eighth Ave., or they can schedule a 
pick-up date at no cost. 
Susan Atkinson, a 21-year-old 
UF history junior and part-time staff member at the Junior League of Gainesville thrift shop, said her fa-vorite part of thrift shopping is the 
uniqueness of the clothes. 
“At a thrift store, you never know 
what you are going to get,” she said. Nonproﬁ  t thrift stores host discount deals, help students

Local authorities said credit card 
fraud is a consistent problem each year.
Gainesville Police arrested two Hous-
ton, Texas, men last week after authori-
ties said they found 25 counterfeit credit cards, according to a police report.
Shoppers are most vulnerable to 
credit card fraud when they shop on-line, Gainesville Police spokesman Of-ﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said.
“On the Internet, that’s the No. 1 
place where credit card numbers are 
compromised,” he said. “You have to 
ﬁ  gure out a balance between conve-nience and security.”
Residents are more likely to be-
come victims of credit card fraud dur-ing holidays, such as Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day, said Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Lt. Brandon Kutner.He said shoppers may try to ﬁ  nd 
the best deals on unreputable websites, 
sometimes leaving their credit card 
numbers at the mercy of criminals. 
Sheriff’s deputies arrested three Mi-
ami men April 3 after authorities said they were in possession of 21 fraudulent 
credit cards, which were possibly cre-
ated with a machine found in the trunk, according to a police report. 
Kutner said local authorities have 
found card skimmers on gas station pumps, and skimmers have also been found on cash registers in other areas of Florida. 
His recommendation: Routinely 
check credit card and bank statements. 
“As technology evolves, also the 
ability for a tech savvy criminal to com-promise the technology evolves, and so 
we see a new type of crime that’s being 
committed because of those technologi-cal advances,” Kutner said.

OPINIONS EDITORLivin’ on a prayer: 
2016 edition
Welcome back, readers. Welcome home. We hope 
you enjoyed that little sliver of vacation. How did it come and go so quickly? It seems just yesterday we were in the heap of finals week, shamelessly pray-ing to the gods to save our GPAs. No matter: time 
to trudge on through another season of classes. Treasure this semester, dear readers. It looks as though it may be our last.
In the two-and-a-half weeks since we at the Alligator took 
off, the world seemed to take a turn toward catastrophe. Both the half-lizard, half-wife-elbowing-theocrat and everyone’s fa-vorite little league coach dropped out of the race for the White House last week, leaving America’s drunk uncle with a direct path to the Republican nomination. The one thing countless upon countless pundits assured us would never happen has, sure enough, landed right at our feet. A Washington Post col-umnist, Dana Milbank, even wrote an article back in October entitled, “Trump will lose, or I will eat this column.” Well, we know what he’s going to be stuffing his turkey with come Thanksgiving.
Even now, we’re hearing the same old song. “Oh, he won’t 
last in the general election. Oh, Hillary Clinton’s lead against him is widening.” In actuality, averages of recent polls reflect Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump narrowing quickly, and some polling even reflects Trump as leading Clinton. Not to mention her obscenely high unfavorability rating — 55 percent — and the fact that she currently faces civil and FBI-led crimi-nal charges, both based on her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Things are really not looking good in politics right now. 
Who’s supposed to protect us? Even the Avengers are fight-
ing one another, for crying out loud. Batman and Superman are still recovering from their recent brawl, and the X-Men are about to deal with their own Apocalypse. Beyonce’s too busy sipping her lemonade to get the ladies in formation. We don’t even have Prince and the Revolution anymore. It’s times like these when we start seriously reconsidering where things are headed. Are we going to make it out of this in one piece? Well fear not, ladies and gentlemen. We know things seem a little crazy, and you may not be altogether happy with classes starting back up again, but there are still remarkably beauti-ful things in this world. Our antidote to trodden times and faint hopes is the cheapest yet greatest drug of them all: good music. Radiohead and the Red Hot Chili Peppers: This is your salvation.  
On Thursday, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released news that 
the band’s new album “The Getaway” will land June 17, and the group also uploaded their new single “Dark Necessities.” Let there be no mistake: If you didn’t have any dark necessi-ties before, you’re bound to discover a few after getting down to this new groove. Moreover, Radiohead shook the world by suddenly dissolving its social media accounts and releasing two new tracks last week, topping it off Sunday evening by dropping its new album “A Moon Shaped Pool.” Listening to it is a near-religious experience.
So take solace, dear readers. Classes may be back, and each 
day’s headlines may speak of impending disaster, but our mu-sicians are here to offer sanctuary to the faint of heart. So let’s take this semester by storm, together — or at least make it through these extended hours for Summer classes.
Zachary Lee
opinions@alligator.orgHi, everybody. My name is Zachary Lee. 
I’ll be one of your columnists this Sum-mer. You can find my column here in 
the Alligator every Tuesday. This being 
my first official column (you may rec-
ognize me from some politically-charged guest columns in past semesters or some crappy sa-
tirical pieces two years ago), I feel like I should 
introduce myself to you. I am majoring in phi-losophy and minoring in sustainability studies. I like peanut butter, my roommate’s dog and the satis-fying crunch of walking on dead leaves. I don’t like the 
beach, adult men who wear Ed Hardy clothing products 
or Smirnoff Ice.
Another thing that irritates me is the plague of politi-
cal correctness I see sweeping college campuses. Luckily, 
we here at UF have yet to be diagnosed with the illness. 
I’m actually proud of how well we’re doing compared to other campuses. Instead of “safe spaces,” we have “free speech zones.” My peers don’t get “triggered.” They get “frustrated.” In fact, one of my biggest issues is we are 
a Pepsi school instead of a Coca-Cola one. UF President 
Kent Fuchs, whom do I have to Snapchat to make this change happen?
As an aspiring satirist, I’m mildly involved in the com-
edy scene here in Gainesville. When talking to fellow co-medians, they all tell me how hypersensitive audiences have manipulated their acts and the content of their mate-rial. This limitation of free speech, I believe, is a socially ingrained sense of dangerous totalitarianism.
In doing so, we distance ourselves from the controver-
sial issues of our world. By walking on eggshells and, ul-timately, not utilizing our right to free speech, we impose on ourselves conformity and fear. Political correctness cre-
ates this cold and disingenuous respect we must have to-
ward other people. Such an atmosphere is not conducive to productive, issue-based discussion. Instead, it sweeps these topics under the rug.
I’m not proposing we all go around humili-
ating one another, but one cannot change an-other’s opinion, or fully confront an issue, by simply limiting rhetoric. In fact, to best solve these issues, an environment where all parties 
can express their opinions freely seems like the 
best way of actually addressing the issues. The reality is, we are all humans. We all put our 
pants on one leg at a time, have insecurities, fight our own battles and shit violently for a week straight after eat-
ing Chipotle. The great poet and writer Charles Bukowski 
once wrote, “We’re all going to die, all of us, what a cir-cus! That alone should make us love each other but it doesn’t.”
Rather than be politically correct and disenfranchise 
people who disagree with us, let’s find solidarity in the little things, like the inability to fully digest fast-casual Mexican food, and the big things, like our inevitable mor-tality. Here, we relate to one another the way we ought 
to: lighthearted, yet serious. Here, totalitarian, 1984-esque 
political correctness falls to the wayside, as healthy dis-cussion and mutual understanding flows like the rivers of ancient Babylon.
With that being said, established readers, if you’re ex-
pecting a politically correct column this Summer from me, you will be disappointed and possibly upset. Now, I won’t write in a way that blatantly embarrasses people, but I will assess a variety of delicate political and social problems 
in a way that is honest, respectful, sensitive and sincere.
I’m looking forward to our Tuesday talks. It was a plea-
sure meeting you all.

Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Don-
ald Trump has a huge electoral problem looming on the horizon, and it seems he and many of his 
supporters either do not want to acknowledge it or 
would rather dismiss it as a non-issue. The problem 
is Trump does not seem to do well with a diverse general election constituency.
For one, he has run a campaign that highlights building 
a border wall, calls for a temporary ban on all Muslim im-
migrants and refers to undocumented Mexican immigrants 
as drug dealers and rapists. Trump’s rhetoric did well — in fact, very well — in Republican primaries, but it probably does not have the mettle to win a long general election against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Take a look at the 2012 election, in which former Re-
publican presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost, even though he won a majority of white male voters. Trump 
needs to get all those voters, plus women, Latinos and 
African-Americans. The policies and things Trump has said just don’t go over well with most voters. But Trump is lacking something else that he vitally needs: the full support of his party.
Trump’s nomination has already splintered the Re-
publican Party in a way that will not be fully reparable this election cycle. While some, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will in all probability come around 
to Trump’s appointment as nominee, other Republicans 
seem to already be packing their bags and looking to 2020 for a more promising candidate. Many Trump supporters say Trump does not need help from the "establishment," but the hard truth is a general election candidate cannot 
be picky when it comes to supporters.
The division will likely increase, with former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin saying she will put her support behind 
Ryan’s opponent in his district this November, recalling a former colleague, former House Speaker Eric Cantor, who 
met a similar fate. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has also 
been vocal on the difficulty of candidates who have local campaigns to run and win with Trump’s policies as the banner for the Republican Party.
Trump seems to understand his own general election 
problem to a certain degree, ergo the Cinco de Mayo taco bowl. While it may not be working, it clarifies how he recognizes his own shortcomings, to some degree. On the other hand, his woes with the “establishment” will be dif-
ficult to repair, since he will have to become part of it and 
unite the party.
Although Trump has started off his general election 
campaign from behind, winning the primaries by a lot, 
he has potential for giving gains to the Republican Party 
this election cycle. Ironically, the things that made Trump so popular with primary voters don’t look promising for the future of the party. Trump can continue to claim he is very popular with minorities and women, but saying it 
will not make it true, no matter how many times he says 
it. If Trump wants to win, he will have to do something that you cannot do over Twitter or at a rally: effectively organize the Republican Party and make peace with dis-
senters. If not, his losses against “crooked Hillary” will be 
huge. Really huge, folks.

The Environmental Law Institute will recog-
nize K. Ramesh Reddy, along with four others, 
for the annual National Wetlands Awards on Wednesday. 
Ramesh Reddy — a UF faculty member for 
37 years — said he was delighted to hear about his nomination for the award, which his men-tor also won in 2002. He studies wetlands and aquatic systems. 
“Peer recognition is a big deal,” he said. “I’m 
very appreciative.”
The program has honored over 200 wetland 
scientists since 1989, and Ramesh Reddy will be recognized for science re-search, said Kathryn Camp-bell, a Gator alumna and 
program manager for the 
awards.
She said the U.S. Botanic 
Garden in Washington, D.C., will host the ceremony, which aligns with National 
Wetlands month.
Campbell said about 100 guests are expected 
to attend. Though the event is free and open to 
the public, an RSVP is required.
Each award recipient will receive a framed 
print of a blue heron, which was created by 
Richard Newton and appears on the cover of the National Wetlands Newsletter, she said. 
Jerry Roach, an acting team leader for the 
Natural Resource Conservation Service, will 
present Ramesh Reddy’s award.
John White, a UF alumnus and former stu-
dent of Ramesh Reddy, nominated the profes-
sor. White said he is currently a professor of oceanography and coastal sciences at Louisiana State University.  
“He’s always been really humble and tried to 
stay out of the limelight — just doing his great work,” White said. “I think sometimes those 
people get forgotten, and he’s certainly some-
body that’s very deserving.” 
White said he uses a textbook authored by 
Ramesh Reddy in his classroom, and he tries to be there for his students, just as the UF profes-sor was for him.
White and Ramesh Reddy recently obtained 
a grant to research the impact of the BP oil spill on Coastal Louisiana, where most of the oil came ashore, White said. 
White said it’s surprising Ramesh Reddy has 
not already won the prestigious award. He is looking forward to watching his mentor be rec-ognized on Wednesday. 
Though Ramesh Reddy is excited to receive 
the award, it will not immediately go on display. 
“You will not see any awards in my ofﬁ  ce,” 
he said. “It’s self-promotion, and I don’t like it. When I retire I will put it on the wall, but not before.” UF professor to receive award for environmental research

As people get older, they experience more 
aches and pains than they did as children. UF researchers recently helped scientists move toward ﬁ  guring out the cause.
By selecting patients who were in good 
health and separated only by age, researchers have discovered humans experience delayed inﬂ  ammatory responses as they get older. 
The result is a feeling of pain that lasts 
for longer amounts of time, said Joseph Ri-ley, the director of the Pain Clinical Research Unit in the UF Pain Research and Interven-tion Center of Excellence.The study is one of the ﬁ  rst of its kind in 
testing the body’s response to pure physical pain via blood testing, as opposed to testing 
the body’s response to stress. One of the tests 
administered involved dunking subjects’ feet in ice-cold water. When people feel pain, such as this extreme cold, it’s mostly from inﬂ  ammation and not from actual injury. 
Riley said pain and inﬂ  ammation are good, 
but when a reaction is delayed and pain sen-sors don’t turn off after the initial injury is gone, people feel pain long after the trauma 
is already healed. 
“This is the ﬁ  rst step in future studies,” 
he said.  Connecting pain and aging

Jane Douglas discovered she could tell 
what — and how often — her students read 
based on how they wrote. 
“It was like a party trick to help their writ-
ing out,” said Douglas, an associate professor 
at UF’s Warrington College of Business. 
She wanted to do quantitative research on 
how lifelong reading impacts adults’ writing 
habits.
Douglas and Samantha Miller, a graduate 
student at UF, began the research in August 2015. They gathered cover letters and sur-veyed more than 120 UF graduate students, getting their average time spent reading vari-ous publications each week. They used two programs to evaluate the complexity of the 
students’ writing.
Though the individuals who scored high-
est on these programs read three to four hours 
outside of class, Douglas and Miller found what the students read was more important than the length of time they read.
Douglas said the concept of mimicry might 
explain why students who read publications such as BuzzFeed scored lower than those 
who read The New York Times.
She said she reads academic articles and 
The New Yorker “cover-to-cover.”  Reading and writing linked

Florida wide receiver Ryan 
Sousa announced via Twitter on Monday of his plans to transfer from the school. Read the story on pg. 16.By Patrick Pinak
Sports Writer
 
Florida’s baseball team is the 
best it’s ever been, and the proof 
is in the record.
The No. 1 Gators (40-8) 
reached 40 wins faster than any 
team in school history, needing 
just 48 games to do so. 
They surpassed the 1996 
team, which reached the 40-win 
mark in 52 games.
Not bad for a program that’s 
existed for more than 100 years and played at least 40 games ev-ery season since 1969.
“It’s a heck of an accom-
plishment,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said in a release after a series-clinching win against Tennessee on Sunday.
“At the end of the year in the 
regular season, 40 wins is not easy to get to.”
With a few hiccups along the 
way, Florida has made its domi-
nance look fairly easy.
And there's one main rea-
son the Gators are currently the only team in the nation with 40 
victories: They’re taking care of weaker teams.
UF is 30-4 against unranked 
opponents and 24-1 against non-conference teams.
Florida, 14-1 in mid-week 
games this year, will look to con-
tinue that trend against South 
Florida at 7 p.m. in McKethan Stadium.
The Bulls (21-26) were swept 
by No. 18 Tulane last weekend and have lost four in a row. 
They also haven’t had much 
luck against the Gators in recent years, as UF has won the last five 
matchups and 17 of the last 18 
contests.
At the plate, USF is weaker 
compared to UF.
Just four Bulls' starters are 
hitting above .250. First base-man Duke Stunkel leads the team in both runs (27) and hits (45), while outfielder Chris Chatfield’s 
seven homers head that catego-
ry.

Dominant Florida faces visiting USF tonight
Barnhill named SEC Freshman of the Week
Florida softball pitcher Kelly Barnhill was named the Southeastern 
Conference Freshman of the Week, the league announced on Monday. Barnhill threw a no-hitter — the first of her career — in UF's 8-0 win against Arkansas on Sunday.By Matt Brannon 
and Brian Lee
Sports Writers
No. 1 Florida marches into May 
with the same swagger that earned 
it back-to-back national champion-
ships.
But before defending the na-
tion’s top honor, the Gators must go 
through the Southeastern Conference 
gauntlet beginning on Thursday.
UF (52-4, 20-4 SEC) heads into the 
postseason with the second-highest 
winning percentage in Florida soft-ball’s 20-year history (the 2008 team 
went 70-5). 
Florida closed on a strong note, 
finishing 6-1 to end the regular sea-
son and outscoring opponents 54 to 
13.
Florida started the break by tak-
ing a series against then-No. 18 Texas 
A&M, its lone loss coming on May 1 in College Station after a sixth-inning slip-up spiraled into a four-run Aggie 
rally with three of the runs unearned. 
But UF bounced back with a dom-
inant pitching attack. Florida’s three 
hurlers — Delanie Gourley, Aleshia Ocasio and Kelly Barnhill — allowed 
just one run in the next four games. 
After a 7-1 win over Florida State 
on May 4, the Gators closed the sea-
son by thoroughly outclassing the 
Arkansas Razorbacks in Gainesville. 
Florida swept the series, 9-0, 5-0, 8-0. 
Freshman Kelly Barnhill elevated 
her already high-profile status as one of the most dominant first-year pitch-
ers in the nation in the final game, 
throwing her first career no-hitter. 
Barnhill let just one Arkansas bat-
ter reach base in the regular-season 
finale, and she was recognized for 
the performance with her second SEC Freshman of the Week award.
Opposing batters are hitting just 
.133 against Barnhill, which would No. 1 Gators softball

Staff Report
Women’s Golf
On Saturday, the Gators se-
cured their place in the NCAA 
National Championship while 
claiming some records along the way.
Riding a program-record 
11-under-par round, Florida tied 
South Carolina to claim a share 
of the NCAA Regional Champi-onship in Baton Rouge, Louisi-ana.
“It was just an amazing 
day,” coach Emily Glaser said in a release. “I could not be more proud of this group and how they responded to the challenge 
today. It was the most patient 
round of team golf I have seen them play, and the timing was obviously great.”
Saturday marked UF’s sec-
ond Regional Championship and its first since 2008.
Junior Karolina Vlckova 
led Florida’s push in the final round, finishing second at 6 un-der par. The Czech Republic na-tive marked a school and course 
record 7 under par to push Flor-
ida up the leaderboard.
“We are happy to be advanc-
ing to nationals, but I’m also 
pleased about the statement 
that we made today and the mo-mentum that this will give us heading to Oregon,” Glaser said in the release.
The Gators will compete in 
the NCAA National Champion-ship in Eugene, Oregon, on May 20.

No. 1 Florida has come a 
long way since losing to then-
No. 1 California on Feb. 26 and to then-No. 16 Stanford just two days later. 
Since then, the Gators (21-2, 
13-0 Southeastern Conference) 
have gone undefeated, beating multiple top-25 teams and cap-
turing both the SEC regular sea-
son and tournament titles.
In the SEC Tournament, the 
Gators were successful in tak-
ing down LSU, Auburn and 
Georgia. But what really set the Gators apart was the play of all seven of UF’s players.
Six Gators secured at least 
one win. Anna Danilina won in all three games.
Brianna Morgan clinched 
the final match against Georgia 
and was named SEC Tourna-
ment MVP, while Spencer Liang clinched the first two matches.
“(Morgan) is a completely 
different player than she was 
last year,” said coach Roland What you missed over the break

Beginning Friday, Florida will 
compete in the NCAA Tourna-ment against South Carolina State at the Ring Tennis Complex 
and will hope to carry their re-
cent momentum with them.
And the Gators have had suc-
cess in the tournament — since the 2010 season Florida has 
made it to at least the quarter-
finals, winning national titles in 2011 and 2012.

For the second-straight sea-
son, Florida finished the Big East 
Tournament as the final team standing. 
Following a 4-2 halftime re-
sult, a second-half surge by the Gators thwarted any chance for a Temple comeback, as UF (18-1) eventually won the confer-
ence tournament final, 16-4, on 
the heels of four hat tricks on Saturday.
Freshmen Lindsey Ronbeck 
and Sydney Pirreca and junior attacker Sammi Burgess scored three goals each, while redshirt senior Nicole Graziano, who was named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player, netted four.
“We gave them a game plan 
and they executed,” coach Amanda O’Leary said in a re-lease. “They do all the work and 
they deserve the credit for the 
outcome of that second half.”
Florida has now won three-
straight conference titles. Last season, it defeated Connecticut 
20-6  in the Big East’s inaugural 
title game on the Huskies’ home turf.
On Sunday, Florida was 
named the No. 2 seed in the up-coming NCAA Tournament, earn-ing the Gators a first-round bye. UF will play either Penn State or

mound.
Moss (2-0, 0.68 ERA) hasn’t 
allowed a hit in his last two starts, going three innings against Jacksonville on April 5 and three innings against Bet-
hune-Cookman on May 3.
Moss will have to step up 
for freshman Jackson Kowar, 
UF’s usual mid-week starter. Kowar could be out for the rest 
of the season with a non-base-
ball related medical condition.
But Moss will have some of-
fensive support behind him.
Florida is riding the hot hit-ting of catcher Mike Rivera, who is 7-for-16 (.438) with two home runs and six RBIs in his 
last four games. 
The sophomore’s eight hom-
ers and 44 RBIs rank second 
and tied for first on the team, 
respectively.
Rivera is enjoying a break-
out season in the power de-
partment, as he totaled just three home runs last year. 
The Venice native has hom-
ered once every 20 at-bats this season, while he homered just once every 75 at-bats in 2015.

be the best mark in program history if 
the season ended today. 
Sophomore Kayli Kvistad and fresh-
man Amanda Lorenz remain the driving forces behind UF’s offense. Lorenz is on pace to close the season with the high-est-freshman batting average in school 
history at .401. 
She’s been swinging with more pow-
er recently, too. 
Hitting five of her seven home runs 
in April, Lorenz adjusted to her first reg-ular season as well as anyone could’ve 
expected her to. 
But for Lorenz and for the rest of the 
Gators, the regular season is over.
After overpowering opponents and 
amassing a dominant 52-4 record, UF turns their focus to the Southeastern Conference Tournament, which begins this Wednesday at 4 p.m. in Starkville, 
Mississippi., when the Gators will face 
either Ole Miss or Georgia. 
As the conference’s top seed, Florida 
earned a first-round bye and is slated 
to face the winner of Wednesday’s Ole 
Miss-Georgia contest.
The Gators will rely on an assort-
ment of veterans and young players to contribute on offense and defense.Florida’s pitching staff was the best 
in the country this season.
Junior Gourley (18-3), sophomore 
Ocasio (19-1) and Barnhill (15-0) were the first trio of UF pitchers to each have 15 victories in a season.
With varying styles, each pitcher 
provides coach Tim Walton the ability to create favorable matchups, which translates to a nightmare for the opposi-tion.
In addition to a conference-best ERA 
of 0.89, the Gators’ pitching will play a crucial role in the tournament.
Florida’s offense is also producing 
well, operating at a plus-290 run differ-ential.
But despite being the class of the SEC 
once again, Florida is guaranteed noth-ing in the postseason.
If it needs a reminder, it doesn’t have 
to look further than last season.
The Gators held the best record and 
top seed, confident after a champion-
ship run the year prior.
But Florida faltered in the semifinals, 
losing 2-1 to Tennessee.
If it wants to add the third confer-
ence championship of Walton’s tenure, it will have to beat the best teams in the 
best conference in collegiate softball.

The UF men’s basketball 
team’s backcourt got a welcomed 
boost on Monday when coach Mike White announced that guard Canyon Barry was transfer-ring to Florida. 
Barry spent his first four years 
attending the College of Charles-ton, where he averaged 12.8 points in 70 career games. In his final season with the Cougars, Barry averaged 19.7 points in 13 games before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury. 
Standing at 6-foot-6, Barry 
brings size to a group of guards that averages close to 6-foot-2. Currently, the tallest of the group are Zach Hodskins and Jhonny Victor, who are both 6-foot-4 and played a combined 12 minutes 
this past season. 
But in addition to his scor-
ing ability and size, Barry brings 
three things that not many re-cruits can: proven academic suc-cess, basketball lineage and a unique entertainment value. 
At Charleston, Barry earned a 
4.0 GPA while double majoring in physics and computer science. He plans to continue his studies at UF by pursuing nuclear engi-neering, which he said was a big reason why he chose to come to UF in the first place. 
“(Florida has) an exceptional 
nuclear engineering program and actually have one of the only nuclear training reactors in the southeast,” Barry said in a re-lease.
In addition to his academic 
success, Barry’s family has a his-tory of success on the hardwood. His father, Rick Barry, is an 
eight-time NBA All-Star and a 
member of the Basketball Hall 
of Fame. Three of Canyon’s half-brothers also played in the NBA. 
And like his father, Canyon 
has gained internet notoriety for taking free throws “granny style,” or underhanded. 
Barry is the fourth member of 
UF’s 2017 recruiting class, join-ing Dontay Bassett, Gorjok Gak and fellow guard Eric Hester. 
UF wideout transferring While UF’s basketball team 
added a player on Monday, the football team lost one. 
Ryan Sousa, a reserve wide re-
ceiver, announced his intentions to transfer on his personal Twit-ter account at around 5:30 p.m. on Monday.
In his two years at UF, Sousa played in two games — both in 
2015 — and didn’t register any 
stats. 
Before arriving in Gainesville, 
Sousa was a three-star wideout 
out of Orlando’s Lake Nona High School who signed with Florida as part of the 2014 recruiting class. 
Even in his own class, though, 
Sousa was buried by future con-tributors Brandon Powell and C.J. Worton. And with early enrollees Dre Massey, Freddie Swain and Josh Hammond all built similarly to Sousa and having played more in the Orange and Blue Debut, it was unlikely he would have seen a significant increase in playing time in 2016.
As of press time, Sousa hadn’t 
announced his transfer destina-tion.
