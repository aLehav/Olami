Vets honored
at memorial
By OLGA VELEZ
Alligator Contr but ng Writer
About 2,000 people gathered with umbrellas and ponchos at f
the Kanapaha Park memorial to celebrate Veterans Day Wednes-
day.
The celebration was held to honor the veterans from Iraq and
Afghanistan, said James Lynch, director of Alachua County Vet-
erans Services.
Capt. Jonathan Pruden, a wounded veteran of the Iraq war
spoke of the sacrifice veterans and their families made.
"Whether during war or peace, all veterans sacrificed their
personal freedoms," Pruden said. "I can tell you story after story
of families who have given up homes, jobs and communities to
follow their loved ones to trauma centers at Walter Reed."
A Walk Through Time Memorial was unveiled to honor six
Alachua County residents who died in the Iraq and Afghanistan
wars.

Locals organize to defend arrested Fest partiers
By J. HUNTER SIZEMORE

Following a Fest-weekend
clash between house partiers and
Gainesville Police Department on
Halloween that led to five arrests,
a local group has formed with amessage: Drop all charges.
The Alachua Committee
Against Brutality announced
Tuesday at a press conference
that it plans to help two of the
five, Ryan Clarey and Doug-
las Demarest, fight the charges
against them.
"We ask our fellow citizensnot to fall for the divide-and-con-
quer tactics and the smoke-and-
mirrors strategy that
Local [GPD spokesman]
NewS Keith Kameg and
GPD are deploying
to try to cover up their culpabil-
ity in this incident," said commit-
tee spokesman James Schmidt.Clarey was charged with vio-
lently resisting arrest and aid-
ing an escape, while Demarest is
charged with resisting without
violence.
The incident began as two
GPD officers attempted to clear
Northwest Eighth Street, which
was crowded by partiers, accord-ing to Kameg.
The partygoers were drawn by
a house show where bands were
scheduled to play later that night,
an event tied in spirit to Fest 8, a
punk music festival.
As officers tried to clear the
street using horns and sirens, one

UF names location for new 24-hour study center
Stimulus funds will cover most renovation costs
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
The almost-100-year-old Newell Hall will
likely be the location of UF's 24-hour study
center.
Built in 1910, Newell is one of the four
oldest buildings on campus and is in need
of renovation.
It's also centrally located and close to food
venues, all of which made it a prime candi-

ing attack while

UFs pass defense,
best in the SEC.
See Story, Page 17.date for the new study center, which is being
built to give students an all-day study op-
tion and to take pressure off Library West.
The renovation, which could start in June
or July and be finished in the fall of 2011, will
be paid for mostly by $12 million in stimulus
funds.
Because UF is using stimulus funds, the
money cannot be used for new construction,
so an existing building must be modified.
And because the building is in the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places and its his-toric look must be preserved, officials said
they will try to secure extra
funds in case there are any
surprises, said Ed Poppell,
UF's vice president of busi-
ness administration.
As an example, Poppell
noted that when UF had to
replace the windows in Ti-
Poppell gert Hall, another historic
building, it cost hundreds
of thousands of dollars more than expected

UF alumni among speakers
for Florida Writers' Festival
Three UF alumni authors will
visit UF this weekend for the 2009
Florida Writers' Festival.
The festival, organized by the
English Department's Creative
Writing Program, is in its 25th
year and brings famous authors,
poets and writers to UF.
"The festival gives students a
chance to meet the writers they
have been reading in the under-
graduate program," said David
Leavitt, a co-director of the fes-
tival.
Four authors are visiting
this year: Chris Adrian, Chris
Bachelder, Chris Tusa and C.D.
Wright. Adrian and Bachelder
are novelists, while Tusa and
Wright are poets.
"[Bachelder and Adrian] are
both innovative, adventurous
writers on the cutting edge on to-
day's fiction," Leavitt said.
Adiran, Bachelder and Tusa
have all earned either bachelors
or masters degrees at UF.
"We liked the idea of hav-
ing them because they're all UF
alums and they're all named
Chris," Leavitt said, adding they
would inspire students who plan
to become writers after gradua-
tion.
The authors will each be do-
ing a reading Thursday, Friday
and Saturday night at the Ala-
chua County Public Library and
Smathers Library East.
There will also be an informal
talk with Bachelder, Adrian and
Wright at Smathers Library East
Saturday afternoon.
Each event is free and open to
the public, and food will be pro-
vided.
The festival is being held in
conjunction with Smathers Li-
brary and the Alachua County
Library system. The authors are
being paid about $2,500 each for
the visit.

Air Force ROTC runs to remember war veterans
0 131 CADETS ATTENDED
THE RUN WEDNESDAY.
By ALISON SCHWARTZ and
MEG WAGNER
Alligator Writers
The light sheet of rain was
enough to remind them why they
were there.
It misted the cheeks of the 131
cadets who gathered Wednesday
at 6 a.m. for Run to Remember,
an event coordinated by the UF
Air Force ROTC to commemorateVeterans Day.
While it wasn't enough to
soak through their uniform gray
T-shirts, it formed trails of dew-
drops in their hair.
Air Force ROTC Cadet Lori Bo-
wen said the rain was a symbol of
wars previously fought.
"It gives us a certain sense of
remembrance," the applied physi-
ology and kinesiology senior
said.
Tyler Holley, an Air Force
ROTC cadet, coordinated the
event in an effort to pay homage
to American veterans."I think Veterans Day is a day
you can recognize and honor the
people that have come before
you," Holley said.
Participating cadets ran from
University Avenue to Fletcher
Drive, trailing
Around west on Sta-Gainesville dium Road and
looping back on
Gale Lemerand Drive.
The runs were spread through-
out the event in groups of 15 to 20
cadets. Between laps, groups per-
formed routine exercises, such as
push-ups and sit-ups.The cadets were also given free
time to play football and Ultimate
Frisbee with their flight mates.
But at 6:45 a.m., everyone
stopped.
The cadets gathered in a horse-
shoe formation for a vigil, observ-
ing a moment of silence just as
the sun peaked through the rain-
clouds.
Maj. James W. Bodnar, anROTC
Air Force instructor, stressed the
importance of respecting veterans
as war wages on in Afghanistan
and Iraq.
"We have two wars going on,and a lot of people forget that," he
said. "People forget that they're
out there every single day in some
pretty austere conditions, often
fighting against a hidden enemy."
And as wars persist around
the globe, Jenicia McFadden, a UF
sophomore and Air Force ROTC
cadet, sees something worth fight-
ing for.
"I think it's just important to
remember that somebody has to
fight for our freedom," she said.
"If we didn't fight for our free-
dom, we wouldn't be where we
are now."
ON CAMPUS
Director discusses success through perseverance
By BRANDON BRESLOW
Alligator Contributing Writer
Director Brett Ratner credits his success to
not taking no for an answer.
From convincing the dean of New York
University's Tisch School of the Arts to ac-
cept him when he was only 16 to pleading
with Universal Studios to let him direct the
comedic drama "The Family Man" in 2000,
his life story is one of determination and tri-
umph.
Ratner, 40, shared stories of some of his
biggest career challenges with a crowd of
about 250 people in the University Audito-
rium Tuesday night at a presentation spon-
sored by Accent.
"I'm here to tell you that if I can do it, any-
body can do it," Ratner said.
Ratner, director of the "Rush Hour" tril-
ogy, "X-Men: The Last Stand," "The Fam-
ily Man" and more than a 100 music videos,
said he knew he wanted to be a director and
attend NYU's film school after he watched
Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull" when he
was 10.
Ratner was accepted to NYU after meeting
with the dean and showing him less-than-ad-
mirable grades but a lot of passion. He made
connections allowing him to swiftly enter the
entertainment industry.
Among those connections were directorSteven Spielberg, who financed one of Rat-
ner's student films and eventually became a
mentor to him, and hip-hop mogul Russell
Simmons.
"It's important to have mentors in what-
ever area you study," Ratner said. "Get
someone who will let you pick their brain."
It was soon after Simmons held a pre-
miere of Ratner's student film that Ratner got
the opportunity to network with artists and
start directing music videos.
The Miami native went on to direct videos
for Madonna, Mariah Carey, Diddy, Jessica
Simpson and the Wu-Tang Clan.
His big break came in 1997, when he was
asked to replace the original director for
"Money Talks," a feature film starring Chris
Tucker and Charlie Sheen.
Ratner told the audience one of his biggest
challenges came after he read the script for
"The Family Man."
He pleaded with Universal Studios to
let him direct the movie, but that wasn't the
hardest part of his project.
Ratner wanted Nicolas Cage to play the
leading role, but he was told it would never
happen. Still, he continued to pursue Cage.
As a result of Ratner's passion, Cage even-
tually signed on to do the movie.
Ratner was paid $24,000 to attend the
event, according to UF's Student Govern-
ment Finance Office.Director Brett Ratner recalled life stories and gave advice to UF students in the Univer-
sity Auditorium Tuesday night. He was brought by the Accent Speakers Bureau.

Fraternities charged with providing alcohol to minors
The three fraternities face possible sanctions from UF
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewa rt@alligator org
Three UF fraternities are fac-
ing possible sanctions from the
university for allowing underage
drinking at events over the sum-
mer and early fall.
Lambda Chi Alpha, Theta Chi
and Sigma Phi Epsilon have all
been charged with providing al-
cohol to minors.
In perhaps the most serious
case to involve an actual charge
against a fraternity, Sigma Phi
Epsilon is accused of provid-
ing alcohol in late July to two
17-year-old girls -one of whom
was transported to the emergen-
cy room after she vomited inside
of a Student Nighttime Auxiliary
Patrol, or SNAP, vehicle near Fra-
ternity Drive -and one 18-year-
old male UF student.
The student told police he and
ftk1 N WM2Mthe two girls had been at a party
at the fraternity's house, where
they had been drinking.
Brock Hankins, Sigma Phi Ep-
silon president, said that wasn't
the case at all. Hankins said the
student and his two friends fol-
lowed several residents into the
house and began taking beers
from various refrigerators.
They were in the house for
two to three hours, Hankins said,
before they were asked to leave.
He said the fraternity views
the incident as a case of breaking
and entering, but chose not to file
charges against the student be-
cause he meant no harm.
In recognition of the serious-
ness of the event, he said the
fraternity installed electronic
padlocks on all its doors and
unanimously voted to become al-
cohol-free for the rest of summer
until early September, when fall
rush ended.
,f I I tS AiiChris Loschiavo, director of
UF's Student Conduct and Con-
flict Resolution, said while the fra-
ternity may not have encouraged
the behavior of the individuals, it
has a responsibility to make sure
everyone who is drinking alcohol
on its property is of age.
"Even though he got in, that
doesn't change the fact that they
were still
UF providingAdministration alcohol to
a minor,"
he said.
He also noted the underage
drinkers were in the house for
quite a long time.
"If someone walked into your
house and started helping them-
selves to your bar, you would
probably kick them out right
away," he said.
In relation to another incident
in early September, Theta Chi is
accused of hosting an off-campuskeg party with underage drink-
ing.
A UF student pledging the fra-
ternity held the party at his house
and told police after he was ar-
rested he felt he shouldn't get
in trouble because the fraternity
forced him to throw the party for
other pledges, according to a po-
lice report.
Ryan Mills, president of The-
ta Chi, disputed that version of
events. Several new members of
the fraternity decided, on their
own, to host the off-campus par-
ty, he wrote in an e-mail.
The members involved were
suspended, he wrote, and the fra-
ternity's international headquar-
ters and regional counselor also
instituted sanctions.
Loschiavo said there is no evi-
dence to suggest the student was
forced to hold the party and that
he told police the story to try to
get out of trouble.
Composer Julia Wolfe brings the Bang on a Can All-Stars and
Trio Mediaeval together in this exciting world-premiere work
inspired by Wolfe's love for the legends and music of Appalachia.
To purchase tickets, call the
Phillips Center Box Office at 352-392-ARTS (2787).
Tickets may also be purchased from any
Ticketmaster outlet or by calling 800-745-3000.The student could not be
reached for comment.
In the third incident that re-
sulted in charges against a fra-
ternity, Lambda Chi Alpha is
accused of providing alcohol to
minors after several students
were found smoking marijuana
from an empty beer can in the
woods near the fraternity house
in late August.
The underage students told
police they had been drinking at
a party at the fraternity.
Lambda Chi Alpha president
Cameron Heard wrote in an e-
mail that the fraternity did not
want to comment.
If found responsible for the
charges, the fraternities face a
number of possible penalties.
In a similar incident in April
involving the Inter-Residence
Hall Association, the group was
given a written reprimand and
executive members were re-
quired to attend an educational
seminar

Reitz official proposes student fee to fund fix-up
0 JOSEPH: RENOVATIONS
MAY COST $42.5 MILLION.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Reitz Union's facelift may
be funded through the help of a stu-
dent fee.
Jaleesa Joseph, chairwoman of
the Reitz Union Board of Manag-ers, stopped by Tuesday night's
Student Senate meeting to give a
presentation encouraging senators
to support a student fee that will
raise money for its renovation and
expansion.
She said the Reitz Union was
built for 19,000 students in 1967
and is now overcrowded and ill-
equipped to handle the needs of
students.
Joseph said the renovationswould cost about $42.5 million. She
said some of the building's flaws
include an aging air-handler system
and an inadequate electrical sys-
tem.
Student Unite PartyGovernment Sen. Sadie Dean,
who represents
District D, questioned how students
would be able to afford the fee.
Joseph said the Reitz Union
Board of Managers would try tokeep the fee as low as possible be-
cause they understand that these are
tough economic times.
"We're not trying to break any-
one's back, by any means," Joseph
said.
Senate also passed an amend-
ment to the Activity & Service Fee
Budget that will transfer about
$150,000 from Accent and Student
Government Productionsbudgets to
the budgets of special events groupsresponsible for organizing heritage
and awareness events of campus.
IRHA also uses the funds for its
Residence Hall Week.
Unite Party Sen. Virlany Taboa-
da, the chairwoman of the budget
and appropriations committee, said
moving the money to the organi-
zations' own budgets will allow
the groups to have more say in the
speakers and performers they bring
to UF during their events.

and Sgt. Domenick Moretti were
given Legion of Honor awards for
their assistance in the liberation of
France on D-Day.
According to Lynch, Price and
Moretti were not able to make it to
the official ceremony in South Flor-
ida because of their health, so the
French government was going to
mail the awards to them until Veter-
ans Services acted.
"We thought they deserved more
than that," Lynch said.
Price stood silently and Moretti
sat patiently in his wheelchair as the
awards were presented to them.
Although the event focused
on past achievements, Sgt. James
Brown got to show heroism when
a brown Humvee military vehicle
began to roll downhill with a 9-year-
old inside.
Irena Melvin was in front of the
vehicle to take a picture of her son,
Kile, when she realized it was head-
ing toward her.
"I looked up, and his eyes were
wide open," Melvin said. "I don't
even want to know what hap-
pened."
Brown jumped inside and quick-
ly pulled the break to prevent a ca-
tastrophe.
"I am thankful that the soldier
was able to hit the break in time,"
Melvin said.
Others stayed safely on the
ground as they looked up and
pointed to the three World War II
vintage aircrafts, which flew over
the audience in a triangle formation
before the start of the celebration.
Everyone at the celebration joined in
for a moment of silence in honor of
the Fort Hood victims.
Organizations like the American
Red Cross, the Young Marines and
the U.S. Army pitched tents around
the park to provide more informa-
tion about those organizations.
Gainesville High School had tents
to fundraise for their programs by
selling hot dogs, hamburgers and
refreshments.LOCAL
Failed world record attempt still 'a party'
By DAVID TINTNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
While the rain may have been a pain
in the neck for some people Wednesday,
others spent the afternoon getting the pain
massaged away.
About 240 people gathered at Univer-
sity House apartments on Northwest 13th
Street to break the world record for the
longest massage chain -nearly 200 peo-
ple short of the current record of 430.
In order to comply with the Guinness
World Records standards, participants
had to form a single-file line and give and
receive a three-minute massage.
Although it was drizzling and new ar-
rivals were slowly trickling in, participants
were enticed to continue waiting by scant-
ily clad Hooters waitresses with prizes and
giveaways. Students and employees of
the Florida School of Massage also set up
chairs and gave back and neck massages.
After about an hour, despite franticmass text messaging attempts, the orga-
nizers realized they would not be able to
muster up enough people to break the re-
cord.
"I'm a little disappointed we didn't
break the record, but I'm still going to get
a massage," said Jessica Castillo, a UF se-
nior.
"We just turned it into a party
in the rain instead of t

While officer Steve Jones was arresting the unidentified
man, Ryan Clarey, 25, allegedly interfered by trying to free
the man and telling him to run, according to a report.
Jones then moved to arrest Clarey, while the costumed
partier escaped.
Clarey allegedly tried to punch Jones in the head, and
the officer Tasered him and "took him to the
Local ground," according to the report.
News About six people then attacked Jones with
kicks, punches and thrown objects.
Two other officers called for backup and fought the at-
tackers until 20 more units arrived, according to Kameg.
Two YouTube videos have surfaced detailing the con-
flict.
The first clip shows the attempted arrest of the cos-
tumed man who disobeyed officers, and the second clip
opens with people attacking Jones as he kneels on top of
Clarey. So far there is no footage of the initial interaction
between Jones and Clarey, and GPD and the committee
are calling for witnesses to step forward.
GPD plans to make additional arrests if more of Jones'
attackers can be identified based on the video, Kameg
said.
The committee seeks witnesses to build its case,
Schmidt said.

Ryan Clarey, 25, who was Tasered during a clash between partiers
and Gainesville police officers on Nov. 1, talks to a reporter Tuesday
night about the incident at a house five blocks north of where the
fight happened. He is charged with resisting an officer with violence
and announced Tuesday that he plans to fight the charges in court.

Editorial
Take It Easy
Police, partygoers should
think before acting
r TF1hey think Gainesville is their personal toilet. coming
from behind shows what kind of garbage they are."
These are the words that Gainesville Police spokes-
man Keith Kameg used to describe five individuals arrested for
attacking police at a Fest after party on Nov. 1. He went on to
describe these individuals as a "fringe element" who only vis-
ited Gainesville looking for a place to stay.
For the five men arrested, though, it may not be as cut-and-
dry as Kameg makes it out to be.
Kameg's bitter remarks were made while many of the de-
tails surrounding the incident remained murky. The Gainesville
Police Department initially described the individuals as men
from out of town; as it turns out, two of the men arrested live
in Gainesville.
Those accused of attacking the police claim that they did not
participate in the attack at all. Rather, they were picked out of a
massive crowd as additional police dispersed the estimated 500
people who filled the streets.
The only sure fact about this incident is that an attack took
place. Video available on the alligator.org Web site shows that
a handful of people hit and kicked police as they Tasered and
held down one man accused of interfering with an arrest and of
resisting arrest himself.
Unfortunately, the faces of those involved in the attack are
not clear. If the identities of these individuals are discovered, we
believe they should be prosecuted, and we encourage any Al-
ligator readers who can positively identify them to do the right
thing and rat them out -because that's what they deserve.
But the video does seemingly support the defendants' claim
that it would be difficult to pick the attackers out of a crowd of
500, especially after the fact. Police reports describe the attack-
ers as returning to the crowds before being arrested. We hope
that the police have positively identified the three who were ar-
rested for the attacks, rather than pulling innocent (well, mostly
innocent) partygoers out of a massive crowd and charging them
with serious crimes.
To the question of excessive force raised by multiple Alliga-
tor readers in letters and Internet comments, the videos miss
a few crucial moments that would be necessary to make that
determination. Witnesses claim that by Tasering this person
multiple times, the police crossed the line. But when faced with
what is fairly described as a "mob" of angry partygoers, the
pressure placed on the police must have been intense, and they
will undoubtedly argue that such a response was necessary.
We feel that a better question, and one we can reasonably
address with the known facts, is why the two officers chose to
engage a crowd of 500 without waiting for sufficient backup.
Simply driving through the crowd with horns and speakers in
attempts to disperse them is one thing.
But when some partygoers decided not to move, and the
crowd became more confrontational, the choice to make arrests
and deploy a Taser without waiting for more officers undoubt-
edly emboldened violent elements among the crowd.
The decisions that face police in stressful situations like this
are difficult to question, especially after the fact and without all
the evidence. But as a matter of policy, when faced with crowds
of this size, the police should refrain from acting until enough
officers are present to ensure the safety of not only the police,
but the crowds as well.
Because sometimes people need to be protected from their
own destructive tendencies.
As another matter of policy, Gainesville Police Department
should refrain from throwing around phrases like "garbage"
until all the the facts are known (well, even then it's probably
not the best PR move).
In murky situations like this, it's best not to rush to action -
or to judgment.

New policies could cut Web freedoms
irst they came for the digital pirates, and I did notspeak out -because I was not a digital pirate.
Under the auspices of "copyright protection,"
40 countries met last week in South Korea to continue
writing the obituary of digital freedom. The Anti-Coun-
terfeiting Trade Agreement, spearheaded by our presi-
dent, is so completely secret that only bigwigs at the
top of the world corporate structure are allowed to see
what is going on -and even then, only after signing a
confidentiality agreement and promising to say nothing
to the public.
Get on the Web while you still can and read about
ACTA and the next big meeting in January. A few blog-
gers are fighting the good fight on this and following
what could be the biggest story of the digital age, espe-
cially James Love from The Huffington Post. Were it not
for what already exists of the many noodly appendages
of the Internet bringing truth to power, this top-secret
global business agreement would never have seen the
light of day.
Our Congress seems to be lying down on this one, so
it is up to other free countries to enforce their own con-
stitutional law and protect the avenues of free speech
on the Internet.
Obama is going above American law and trying to
make your Internet service providers liable for content
that some soulless corporate lawyer decides is infring-
ing on their copyright.
It's sort of like holding 1-75 accountable for speeding
cars, but much more damaging.
On top of that, Obama and ACTA want to hold Web
sites legally responsible for user-generated content.

this ACTA mess.This has been an absolute wet
dream of the powerful vested in-
terests of big business since the
Web began a few decades ago, but
it has also been the defining hall-
mark of the Obama era.
Senate bill 773, The Cybersecu-
rity Act of 2009, was introduced in
April and goes even further than
Under the traditional American power grab of pro-
tecting the "free flow of commerce," S.773 wants to give
the president total power to completely shut down the
Internet for a vague "national security emergency" with
no limitations or timelines for removal.
The Patriot Act seems like a pinprick compared to
Obama and his Freddy Krueger fingers slashing up
communications freedoms.
We are living in the Golden Age of the Internet. The
Web will never again be as free as it is right now, nor
will it be as explosively evolving. Don't get used to the
way ideas flash across the world in an instant, or to the
speed that life seems to rocket along at in a spectacular
upward spiral.
The kind of power the Internet now holds scares the
real powers that control the world. If Facebook were a
country, it would be the fourth largest in the world. Not
that long ago, standing armies would be dispatched to
tear apart a group even a fraction of that size. Nowa-
days, we have politicians and lawyers butchering be-
hind closed doors.

eating the three U E EProposed public option destined to fail
This letter is in response to statements
made by the UF College Republicans' chair-
man, Bryan Griffin, and the Florida College
Democrats' president, Ben Cavataro, in Tues-
day's article "Locals react to House vote."
Mr. Griffin, it is true that Speaker Pelosi
did not listen to the people, but she ignored
conservatives, progressives and moderates
alike. The vocal conservative opposition is
well known. What hasn't been widely publi-
cized is that nearly 60 percent of Americans
want a government-run health care option.
Where is their representation in Congress?
The public option in IR 3962 is a sham. It
will only please the ill-informed Democratic
base and anger the ill-informed Republican
base. The biggest problem is that this govern-
ment program will not be available to all. In
addition, the rates are not tied to Medicare.
The implication is that the government pro-
gramwill have to negotiate rates like any other
insurer. The catch is that when the plan opens,
it will have no enrollees, meaning health care
providers will have little incentive to offer the
volume discounts available to other insurers.
Another problem is that subsidies will be
available to citizens not enrolled in the pub-
lic plan. With this mechanism, the situation
above turns out to be a Catch-22. As the gov-
ernment program is unable to control prices,
very few people will enroll in it, leaving it per-
petually weak and unable to compete in the
market. So no, Mr. Cavataro, the public option
will not help control costs.
With the inclusion of mandatory insurance
requirements and the Stupak-Pitts amend-
ment, I think that I would be OK if Sen. Joe
Lieberman filibustered the bill. And, as a pro-
gressive who believes in the social safety net
and Keynesian economics, that hurts to say.

UFgrad studentPublic must take interest in polluted site
The Cabot-Koppers Superfund site is at
the corner of Northwest Sixth Street and
Northwest 23rd Avenue. For those of you
who don't know about this, let me enlighten
you. This property has been used since 1916
for wood treatment. Chemicals from this site
have been found seeping into the groundwa-
ter and surface water, including arsenic, cop-
per and nine other chemicals found to cause
cancers and other health problems. Accord-
ing to EPA testing in 2006, harmful chemi-
cals have already started reaching the upper
portion of the aquifer (not good, considering
nearly 100 percent of the drinking water in
Florida comes from the Floridan aquifer). As
bad as all this sounds, it might surprise you
that nearly 19 years after a cleanup approach
was signed, no action has been taken besides
a few trenches being dug.
As an environmental engineering stu-
dent, it is discouraging to see that people
don't take an active interest in issues like
this, but when they are diagnosed with can-
cer they go complain to public works. I don't
know why I am wasting my time doing wa-
ter treatment research if the citizens will ig-
nore what is seeping into the water around
them.
All I know is that the longer the issue is
left unresolved, the larger it becomes.
Joseph Delfino of the UF Environmental
Engineering Department labels this as "an
uncivil inaction," commenting that "this
has been a disgrace from the local, state
and national politics and agencies. No one
wanted to take leadership. Only now are the
residents feeling more empowered [to act],
but they cannot get it done without political
strength and the politicians' willingness to
act rather than preserve their reputations."

Local DJ BBP stays true to his music, Miami influence
By JON SILMAN
avenue writer
Disk jockey BBP's Friday night
lights are green lasers and strobes.
Behind the booth, he is seven caged
tigers condensed into one man. He
plays music out of a classic Buick cut
in half behind a bar at club Spannk.
Completely in control of the massive,
pumping sound and the young, hot
partygoers, he can turn the crowdfrom a breeze to a sandstorm in
about a half-second. In his nonde-
script black "BBP" cap and shirt and
with neatly trimmed facial hair, he
punctuates every collision of hand to
button with a full body thrust.
A Miami native since he was 2
years old -after he moved from
Cuba -Peter Pancho is the consum-
mate self-made man. He plays house
music, a style of electronic dance
music with heavy bassbreaks and rolling changes, every
Friday night and packs the place.
Things were not always so easy,
though.
As a teenager in Hialeah, Pancho
fell in love with the South Beach
electronic music scene. He started
working clubs when he was 17, and
he got good gigs in Miami clubs play-
ing popular music, but he felt he was
wasting his life
Photo courtesty of Peter Pancho
Peter Pancho, also known as DJ BBP, spins at club Spannk and remixes tracks that he sells online Pancho has been
invited to play Ultra Music Festival in Miamiaway.
"I came up to Gainesville for
Gator Growl one year, and I just fell
in love with the place. It's the perfect
party town. Exactly the scene I was
lookingfor," Pancho said.
Pancho struggled and hustled his
way up to Gainesville, saving up the
money he made from those Miami
gigs. He got an associate degree
from Santa Fe College and studied
for one semester at UF before drop-
ping out to pursue his music career
full time.
"School is not for me, bro. Music
is my passion," he said.
Pancho made a name for himself
as a DJ at club Boutiq. He worked
there for a year and a half but had to
leave after a disagreement over the
type of music he should play.
"They wanted more top 40 stuff. I
wasn't feeling that. I wanted to bring
the house music that I heard in Mi-
ami here to Gainesville," he said. "At
the end of the day, I can't do music
that I don't like."
He was back at square one. After
a few months with no work, he ran
into a promoter for the newly opened
club Spannk, and he pitched the
idea of an all house music night at
the club. It was a rocky start.
"At first, no one was showing up.
Over the course of a couple months,
it really started to get hot. By three
months, it was a revolution. The club
is always packed with a good crowd,
and I can bring in artists from all over
to DJ here," Pancho said.
In addition to working at Spannk,
Pancho also remixes tracks and sells
them online at ratedh.net. One of hissignature remixes is of the Gators
fight song with snippets of Tebow's
famous "you'll never see anyone
work harder" speech.
Pancho is passionate about work-
ing hard and chasing his dreams.
"Anythingthat you love or want
to accomplish, you can, no matter
what anyone says. Don't listen to the
negativity or the naysayers," Pancho
said. "It doesn't matter if it's house
music or Chemical Engineering, just
give it your all and don't let anyone
stop you."
All of Pancho's hard work has
recently paid off. He's been invited
to play Ultra Music Festival in Miami,
the biggest electronic music festival
in the world with more than 85,000
people in attendance in 2009.
"Eight years ago I went to Ultra for
the first time, and I knew that I would
work my ass off to get to that stage.
It's an honor," he said.
During his set, Pancho frequently
builds his songs into crescendos,
and it's like being on a perpetual
roller coaster. The rise is slow and
dreamy. There's a pause at the
peak just before the explosive drop
thatyou can feel in the pit of your
stomach.
At the end of the night, when the
crowd is filing out toward the door, a
youngSpanish man in a nice button-
up shirt leans over the bar toward
Pancho and yells,
"You are the bestf***ing DJ I
have ever seen, bro. Thank you so

a'llgatorAdding shine to
holiday outfits
By KARINA GALVEZ
avenue writer
'Tisfinally the season to bring
out your holiday best for every
cocktail party and family gath-
ering. When picking the perfect
outfits for the holiday season,
think versatility and embellish-
ment with key accessories to
create looks that will transition
between friends and family.
The season's most popular
accessories can add holiday
sparkle to dresses already hang-
ing in your closet. Last year's
New Year's Eve black dress can
become this year's Thanksgiv-
ing or holiday office party frock
by pairing it with a jewel-toned
cardigan, animal print or faux
fur cover-up. Wear your dress
to a funkier gathering by pairing
it with a full neck of jewels or a
feathered hair piece.
When shopping for new piec-
es to add to your holiday ward-robe, keep trends and wearabil-
ity in mind. If your celebrations
take you south, a thin, animal
print scarf may be a more sen-
sible option than a fur collar. The
heat will force that fur collar to
stay in your closet and you to
make an unplanned trip to the
mall. If you're headed north for
the holidays, keeping your legs
warm under a cocktail dress
has never been more fun. Pat-
terned tights add an interesting
accent to plainer dresses while
Iam6 or sequined leggings make
a bolder statement. Minimize
accessories by focusing on one
trend and carrying it through the
entire look. A sequined dress or
animal printsilk top is enough to
make a statement without over-
doing it.
The holiday season is by na-
ture full of light and glitter. Ac-
cessorize smartly to avoid the
risk of being confused for an or-
nament.

Take one part Beatles, toss in the
sounds of Phish and garnish the mix
with a tad of '80s rock. What do you
get?
The Rooze's new CD, "The One for
Everyone."
The Gainesville band, consisting
of drummer Greg McCracken, guitar-
ist Brandon Cook and singer/bassist
David Farb, released its second al-
bum last week. The members have
been playing roots rock together for
more than a year around Gainesville
and various cities throughout Flori-
da.
"Our music is pretty danceable
and pretty upbeat," Cook said. "A lot
of people tell us it's not like other
music out there, in a good way."
Cook said that the sound of The
Rooze is different than other bands
because each band member has dif-ferent tastes that contribute to the
music they play. While Cook listens
to rock bands like the Foo Fighters,
Farb brings his love for indie music to
the table and McCracken's passion
for '80s hard rock shines through his
heavy drum beats.
"Take all of those [tastes], jumble
them together, then take the best
parts of each, and that's what we
sound like," Cook said.
He also said thatThe Rooze strives
to bring live music back to Gainesville
hangouts, as more clubbers prefer to
listen to DJs these days. The band
play at clubs and bars such as Mar-
ket Street Pub, Common Grounds
and the Atlantic.
The Rooze will perform its next
show at the Deland Music Festival on
Saturday. The festival is the biggest
one-day festival in the Southeast
with over 100 independent acts play-
ing on 21 different stages, according
to its Web site.

November dos and don'ts
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
Gentlemen, start your follicles.
As we near the end of the second week of No
Shave November, thousands of men are taking
it upon themselves to deter women, cleanliness
and job applications in the month-long event that
supposedly separates the men from the boys.
For those of you who don't know what No
Shave November is, it's the month where men,
and sometimes women, forgo the act of shaving,
trimming or any other sort of shearing of their fa-
cial hair to show hypermasculinity.
But be warned no-shavers, in addition to
catching disgusted looks from women and scar-
ing small children, you may come home for that
relaxing Thanksgiving break to get the ass-whip-
ping of a lifetime from your dad, who thinks the
hairier version of you that just walked in the door
in the middle of the UF v. FSU game is really a
blood-thirsty hobo looking to crash dinner-
By the way, it would probably be a good idea
to stay away from playgrounds or to keep from
buying white vans from the '70s during this time.
You'll already look creepy enough.
If you want another way to put a strain on ro-
mantic and otherwise friendly relationships for
the sake of exhibiting your manliness, you can
always try what Robert Clarkson of Queenstown,
New Zealand, did.
This innovative man decided to stray from the
doldrums of typical suburban living by turning his
house into a pirate ship.
When he proposed the idea to his then-sensi-
ble girlfriend, she scoffed and made an outland-
ish deal with him in which she would only con-
cede if he were able to raise a Facebook group of
one million people in support of the pirate house
idea.
Well, she shouldn't have underestimated the
will of a pirate-at-heart combined with a bunch ofpeople who will back whatever they find interest-
ing.
After two years of gathering members, Clark-
son's Facebook group, "If 1m people join, girl-
friend will let me turn our house into a pirate
ship," reached its goal Oct. 29 of this year.
Now, the 26-year-old Clarkson just has to fig-
ure out how to raise funds and tell the neighbors
what he's up to. Fortunately, his girlfriend has
since warmed up to the idea, so this pirate is still
going to be getting booty. You didn't really think
I'd be able to get through this without such a pa-
thetic pun, did you?
Here's something for the more feminine read-
ers, if you're still with me. I'm sure most of you
have heard about Aerosmith's frontman, Steven
Tyler, leaving the band.
Apparently, the old fogeys all just got so pissy
with each other that he up and quit just before
their 40th anniversary next year. But, the band
thinks, for some reason, that they'll be able to
move on without the raspy-voiced lead singer.
Those dudes need to swallow their pride and
realize what their band's all about. And I know a
lot of you girls are solely attracted to that lanky
guy who has better highlights than your mom but
is old enough to be your father. You are the rea-
son I throw "Aerosmith's Greatest Hits" into my
car's CD player when I go on dates.
Someone needs to tell those guys that Aero-
smith can't physically continue without Steven
Tyler.
The week-long anticipation to find out who
would be involved in the threesome on Gossip
Girl turned out to be not so hot. Don't worry, I
won't give too much away. It's bad enough that
Hilary Duff is on the show, but Lizzie McGuire in a
threesome? I don't want to think about that.Small roles still allow
for humor, revenge
By ERIK VOSS
avenue writer
My first acting role was in a third
grade Valentine's Day-themed play
called "Princess Lonely Heart." It
was one of those low-budget cafe-
torium shows for parents to waste
their camcorders' batteries on their
child's struggle to remember lines.
The show's director was an old,
cranky Australian woman named
Mrs. Kelly. On the surface, her goal
appeared to be fostering the theat-
rical arts in young people, but only
I knew her true plan: to manipulate
the casting process to reward the
students who adored her most.
"Good morning, Mrs. Kelly!" we
cheered in our conditioned Austra-
lian accents upon her arrival every
Wednesday morning.
"Good morning," she'd reply.
"It's nice to see you all."
"And it's nice to see you, Mrs.
Kelly!" lied Tommy.
That stunt landed Tommy the
part of Cupid.
I was denied all the big roles and
instead cast as Cupid's fourth mes-
senger. It was an insignificant role
with few lines, redeemed by the
fact that I got to carry a bow and
arrow, which Mrs. Kelly confiscated
when I tried to assassinate Cupid.
Mrs. Kelly did not trust boys. To
her, we were thugs who refused to
memorize lines and shanked one
another with pencils. The only way
to protect the fairer sex was to con-fine boys to walk-ons and charac-
ters with lines like "Yes, sir" and
"Hooray!"
Her suspicions were partly valid,
however. Everytime she snapped at
the boys to speak louder or smile,
we'd visualize her being mauled by
kangaroos.
"Oy, mate!" she'd wail. "Help
me!"
"I'd love to help, Mrs. Kelly," I'd
respond, "but someone took my
bow and arrow."
Still, as much
as I hated the
woman, I couldn't
help trying to win
her affection. On
the day of the
show, I prayed a
meteor strike or a group of loose
kangaroos might take out Cupid
and his first three messengers, al-
lowing me to ascend into the spot-
light and reveal my superior talent.
"Brilliant! You're way better than
Tommy!" Mrs. Kelly would shout
from the back of the cafetorium.
"Here's your bow and arrow back."
Such a miracle never happened.
Instead, my mother's old VHS tape
shows Cupid's only unarmed mes-
senger mutter his one line:
"Hooray."
In that one, poorly delivered
word, I brought down the whole sys-
tem. Cupid's Fourth Messenger did
not smile. What now, Mrs. Kelly?
With "hooray," I had the last
hurrah.

Garcia stepping up in
first year as sole starter
South Carolina quarterback Stephen Garcia is averaging 242.1 passing yards per game,
good for second best in the SEC. He split time with Chris Smelley last year against UF.By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bca llovi@a Iligator org
Last year, Stephen Garcia was splitting
time with Chris Smelley at quarterback
for South Carolina when the Gamecocks
traveled to Gainesville.
Smelley's transfer to Alabama to play
baseball left Garcia as the team's only op-
tion for the starting quarterback job, and
Garcia has grown from the lost player
who was just 6-of-13 passing for 28 yards
and an interception in the Gamecocks'
56-6 loss to the Gators in 2008.
"He has a pretty good idea of what's
going on now," South Carolina coach
Steve Spurrier said. "We asked him the
other day if he knew what was going on
in The Swamp last year, and he said 'I
had no idea what was going on.' He was
a lost Gamecock down in The Swamp last
year."
Garcia will face his biggest challenge
this season against Florida's pass defense,
which ranks first in Southeastern Confer-
ence and second in the nation. The Gators'
134.4 pass yards per game are about 25
yards less than the next-best team.
UF coach Urban Meyer has taken no-
tice of the Gamecocks improved aerial at-
tack, though.
"They aren't running the ball quite as
well, but they are throwing it much bet-
ter," Meyer said.
Garcia has increased the team's pass-
ing average more than 20 yards per game
to 246, good for second in the SEC, and abig reason has been his decision making.
The redshirt sophomore has thrown
just six interceptions this season in his 341
attempts compared to eight interceptions
in 2008 in just 122 passing tries.
Although the Gamecocks were third
in the SEC in passing yards per game last
season, they were the worst in the nation
in interceptions thrown with 27.
Garcia and Smelley combined to toss
three picks in South Carolina's last meet-
ing with Florida.
Spurrier knows that number will have
to stay down against the
top interception team
in the conference if his
Gamecocks will have
any chance of pulling
off the upset.
"Hopefully, he goes
out there and makes
good decisions and
Spurrier takes care of the ball,"
Spurrier said. "He has done a good job of
taking care of the ball this year. Our turn-
overs are way down from where we were
this time last year."
Spurrier said Garcia's improvement is
largely because of his year of experience
and not having to share reps this season.
Even though Garcia has made strides
this year, he is still far away from being a
premier quarterback in college football.
"He needs to continue making the com-
mitment to learn the game, learn how to
play, learn how to audible here and there
and get out of a bad play and get to a good
play," Spurrier said.
Meyer will unseat Spurrier as
best coach in Florida history
t's time to start the debate again.
As Urban Meyer-Steve Spurrier
IV is set to kickoff Saturday, dis-
cussion over who is the best Florida
coach will ensue.
At this point, it's really an argu-
ment over what means most to you.
Spurrier built the Florida football
program, on and off the field, from
1990-2001. He is the old guard.
On the gridiron during his reign,
UF had never-before-seen success.
The Gators won nine games in
every one of Spurrier's 12 seasonsU

0 ALABAMA FACES DAN MULLEN'S
OFFENSE AT MISSISSIPPI STATE.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmcca ll@a Iligator org
Florida coach Urban Meyer said this
week his team won't start preparing to face
Alabama in the Southeastern Conference
Championship until the week of the game,
but the Crimson Tide will get a feel for the
Gators this week.
No. 3 (AP)/No. 2 (BCS) Alabama (9-0, 6-0
SEC) will travel to Mississippi State (4-5, 2-3
SEC) on Saturday to face former UF offensive
coordinator Dan Mullen's offense, giving the
Tide a preview of what to expect on Dec. 5.
"I think their offense is similar in some
ways to Florida in terms of how they can run
the ball," UA coach Nick Saban said. "I thinkthey're very effective running the ball, and I
think the No. 1 objective we're going to have
is to try to stop the run.
"It's a challenging offense to defend. I
think coach Mullen has done a great job over
there installing the offense and teaching it,
and the players are doing a wonderful job of
executing it."
The Bulldogs boast the nation's No. 12
a rushing offense and a talent-
ed running back in Anthony
S -Dixon, but Saban's defense
should be up to the task.
Alabama is ranked in the nation's top six
in four defensive categories (rushing, passing
efficiency, total and scoring) and can rely on
playmakers like cornerback Javier Arenas.
In his second season as a defensive starter,
Arenas has shown himself to be much more
than just a deadly kick returner. Arenas aver-

Cusack interns with UAA
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
There is no secret to senior libero Elyse
Cusack's success.
"She is determined, she is punctual,
she is extremely thorough, she double
checks everything to make sure it's right,
and she's always asking if she can help out
more."
But this quote isn't from coach Mary
Wise. Instead it came from Cusack's boss,
Samantha Scales, the coordinator for base-
ball complex & operations.
The attributes that have made Cusack
successful on the court have translated to
an internship opportunity with the Uni-
versity Athletic Association's Baseball Op-
erations.
In her senior year, Cusack is not taking
any classes in order to focus on the intern-
ship. Some of the things she works on in-
clude recruiting questionnaires, helping to
schedule recruiting visits and writing the
contracts that were sent out to next year's
visiting baseball teams.
Cusack takes her work seriously, espe-
cially because of the desire she has to be-
come a coordinator of operations.
"We have a person, Kelley Kish, who is
our director of operations, and I was able
to see what she does for us from planning
our team's travel, traveling with us and
working with our camps," Cusack said. "I
just thought it would be a fun job and a
great way to stay in sports."She is not the only volleyball player
working with the UAA, however.
Former UF opposite hitter Amber Mc-
Cray works directly for Lynda Tealer, the
senior associate athletic director for wom-
en's sports.
Both interns believe their experience
as athletes has helped them thrive in their
positions.
"I knew that was a huge asset that I
would use in my interview," McCray said.
"Being an athlete and knowing what an
athlete goes through is just always a good
asset to have on a support
staff because you will
have that perspective."
While Cusack admit-
Volleyball ted it was weird to gofrom work to practice at
first, she has gotten used
to working for a team and playing for one
at the same time.
As her time as a collegiate athlete is
winding down, she hopes her career in
sports is just getting started.
"Sports is something I've known my
whole life, it's something that I enjoy and I
would love to have a career in sports later
on," she said.
GATORS LAND TWO TOP RECRUITS: The
Gators may have found a replacement for
their senior libero as they have received a
letter of intent from libero Taylor Unroe.
Setter Chanel Brown has also decided
to sign with Florida. Both players will be
eligible to compete in 2010.21

Kiffin credits recruiting coordinator Orgeron; Saban talks about movie appearance
SEC, from page 17
ages more than six tackles and more
than one tackle for loss per game,
and Saban believes his playmaker
has shown enough to warrant a high
selection in the NFL Draft.
KIFFIN CREDITS COACH 0: Tennes-
see coach Lane Kiffin and defensive
coordinator Monte Kiffin garneredmost of the attention during the Vol-
unteers' coaching shakeup last year,
but Lane believes another coach
should be getting spotlighted for his
efforts as well.
Defensive line coach and re-
cruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron,
who formerly coached at Ole Miss,
hasn't just been an invaluable tool
in recruiting and coaching, he has
also been the go-to assistant when itcomes to keeping
players in line.
"He deals
with a lot of our
discipline and
has done a phe-
nomenal job with
that," Kiffin said.
Kiffin "Our first semes-
ter here we have our highest GPA, I
believe, in five years."We've had zero arrests in 11
months here."
SABAN A MOVIE STAR?: Saban plays
himself in "The Blind Side," a movie
about Baltimore Ravens tackle Mi-
chael Oher's journey from poverty
to Ole Miss, and he had no problem
being directed around instead of
calling the shots.
"It's easy to take orders whenyou don't know anything about
what you're doing," he said. "In fact,
I was seeking guidance from every-
one there who would give me any.
"I don't think I need to switch
professions or get rid of my day job
to [act], but it was a wonderful ex-
perience."
The film, which also stars Sandra
Bullock and Tim McGraw, hits the-
aters Nov. 20.

Meyer not worried about Strong's head coaching offers
* STRONG HAS BEEN A
COORDINATOR SINCE 1999.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
As the season draws to a close
and coaching vacancies open up,
Florida defensive coordinator
Charlie Strong's name is sure tobe associated with head coaching
jobs.
But UF coach Urban Meyer
isn't worried about it being a dis-
traction.
"Every year we go away on
a retreat as a coaching staff, and
I always talk about how when
you're at Florida, that's part of
the deal," Meyer said. "However,
the loyalty is to this football team,these players and this program.
Once the season is over, then let's
handle this professionally.
"We love Char-
lie, and he's obvi-
ously a tremendous
coach," he added.Football "I did talk to him
over the summer in
a brief conversation. And the best
thing is, he mentioned to me thatthe focus is through December
when the season is over."
Strong reiterated those
thoughts after practice Thurs-
day.
"I just have to work and con-
tinue this job right now," Strong
said. "This is my whole focus, just
making sure our defense goes out
and performs."
Meyer has said multiple timesthat Strong, a defensive coordina-
tor since 1999, deserves a shot at
a top position. He said he hopes
race won't be a factor, as Strong,
a black man, said last January
that his interracial marriage had
harmed him in the job market.
"I would hope not, but I don't
live that," Meyer said. "I know it
certainly plays no part at the Uni-
versity of Florida."
PHIL, from page 17
riod.
The Ol' Ball Coach won the 1996 nation-
al title as well as six SEC titles.
When he had arrived in Gainesville,
there were no SEC titles. Zero.
He finished with a 122-27-1 record (.819
win percentage).
He even gave Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
its more common nickname, The Swamp.
Now let's take a look at Meyer's marks.
In four-plus years, the 45-year-old has
won two national titles and might have an-
other this January.He has two conference championships
and will be playing for a third in Decem-
ber.
His current record at UF is 53-9 (.855
win percentage).
He, too, has won nine games in each of
his full seasons so far as Florida's coach.
A win Saturday will give him his first 8-0
SEC year, something Spurrier did in 1996.
I know it's early, and it's easy to get
swept up in the present when comparing
it to the past.
But when I sat down to dwell on this
topic, two things became clear to me:
If Meyer wins another crystal ball in
Pasadena, he will immediately surpassSpurrier.
If Meyer isn't feeling confetti in Janu-
ary, he will probably still end up passing
Spurrier.
What's the biggest thing holding Meyer
back? Time.
Spurrier's marks are so impressive be-
cause he sustained his success, something
not very easy in the business of college
football coaching.
But while Meyer certainly didn't have
the work ahead of him in 2005 that Spur-
rier had in 1990, Ron Zook didn't exactly
leave the program in great shape.
And the Gators have won 19 games in a
row. One more victory and they'll tie Au-burn's 1993-94 streak for third-best in the
SEC since 1960.
Even more impressive is the fact UF has
won 18 of those 19 games by 10 points or
more.
That's a pretty good feather in Meyer's
cap.
Meyer won with defense and special
teams in 2006.
He did it with an explosive offense and
a clutch defense in 2008.
He's poised to take it home in 2009 with
a strong rushing attack and one of the best
defenses ever.
The truth is the debate is already over.
Sorry, Steve.
