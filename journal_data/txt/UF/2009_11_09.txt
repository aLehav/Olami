Gators still searching for big plays
0 UF STRUGGLING ON
OFFENSE WITH 'BAMA
REMATCH SET.

A week after exploding out
of the gates against Georgia to
score touchdowns on its first
two drives, No. 1 Florida re-
verted to the struggling offense
it has been for most of the sea-
son.
Saturday, the Gators (9-0,
7-0 Southeastern Conference)
moved the ball down the field
with ease at times but never
could get in a rhythm offen-
sively in their 27-3 win over
Vanderbilt (2-8, 0-6 SEC).
"It was a little bit choppy,"
quarterback Tim Tebow said.
"At times, we got into a very
good rhythm moving the ball.
On a couple of those field goal
drives, I thought we were in
good rhythm, but then we
do something to throw us off
schedule. We need to stay on
schedule."
The offense was also lacking

A flurry of hands and feet moved in time
to the sounds of chants and music Saturday
night as hundreds packed the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts to watch frater-
nity and sorority members dance their way
to the top.
The annual Battle of the Greeks Step
Show, put on by Student Government Pro-
ductions Music and Entertainment and
the National Pan-Hellenic Council, drew a
packed house of nearly 1,400 people, accord-
ing to Jason Degren, technical director for
the Phillips Center.
"It really goes to show the importance ofthe event when so many people came out
here in spite of the football game," Degren
said.

Jason Degren
technical director for the Phillips Center
Degren said the competition was the cul-
mination of three months of work by the
steppers, with the last month spent coordi-
nating the routines with the tech staff at the
Phillips Center.The event began at 6 p.m. with music
from DJ Terrah of Magic 101.3 FM. The step
acts then took the stage, alternating between
fraternities and sororities. Each organization
chose a theme to center its routine around,
ranging from "The Matrix" to "Grease."
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Inc. dressed
in black ninja garb and used red and white
canes as swords. The act was complete with
a fight sequence choreographed to a "Mortal
Kombat" theme.
Then Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. set the
stage with cardboard props reminiscent of
a carnival and performed steps and chants,
wearing poodle skirts and jackets.

About 500 people collec-
lively took a giant step -and
thousands of sweaty smaller
ones -Sunday for those who
have yet to take their first.
Gators March for Babies
raised more than $60,000 for
infant health when students,
faculty and alumni participat-
ed in a 5K run that began on an
overflowing Turlington Plaza
and came full circle under a
wavering arch of balloons.
The event, which is in its
sixth year and is organized
by the March
Local of Dimes Col-
News legiate Council
New__ at UF, gathered
donations for
research on premature births
and programs to support full-
term pregnancy.
"Do people know about
prematurity? No," said Ken-
dra Grimes, the organization's
president. "College students
will have to realize that they're
becoming parents soon. I want
to have a baby one day."
According to Grimes, who
has been involved with Gators
March for Babies since 2006
and said she wants three chil-
dren, her group's mission is to
promote both healthy births
and healthy living.
For each $1 donated, 77
cents will go toward prematu-
rity prevention. The rest, she
said, goes to causes ranging
from Alzheimer's to cancer.

Shands shaves heads for
cancer research fundraiser
Naomi Piper sat with a
smile on her face as a razor
zipped through her full head of
strawberry-blonde hair, caus-
ing clumps to fall to the floor.
The haircut lasted less than five
minutes and left her completely
bald.
With an audience of about 30
people, Piper was the first visi-WEDNESDAY

tor to the makeshift barbershop
in a conference room at Shands
Children's Hospital.
After hearing about the event
at the Children's Miracle Net-
work auction on Oct. 28, Piper
decided to participate and shave
her head for cancer.
"It feels weird but in a good
way," Piper said, running her
fingers over her bald head. "Be-
sides, hair grows back."
On Friday afternoon, doctors,
nurses, patients and families
of patients gathered in the pe-
diatric wing of Shands at UF to
raise money for cancer research
through pledges for shaving
their heads.
Piper, who shaved her head
for her son Joejoe Piper, a pa-
tient at Shands who suffers from
a kidney condition, was one of
eight people who shaved their
heads for the cause. The event
was organized by Dr. Bill Slay-
ton, interim division chief and
program director of pediatric he-
matology/oncology. It was the
first of its kind, Slayton said.
"It's beyond my wildest
dream," said Slayton, who also
shaved his hair for the event.
"We passed our goal of raising
$5,000."
According to Slayton, the
main goal of the event was to
raise awareness and encourage
people to donate to enhance the
Immunocompromised Unit for
children with cancer.
Storm Roberts, a KTK morn-
ing radio show host who regu-
larly shaves his head for cancer
awareness, also took part in the
event Friday.
"My wife kissed my hair
goodbye before I left this morn-
ing," Roberts said as his hair was
being shaved.
Also among the participants
was Dr. Vishwas Sakhalkar, di-
rector of Benign Hematology at
Shands.
"It's emotional for me,"
Sakhalkar said. "In my culture,
you shave only after your par-
ents die. I called my parents be-
forehand."
Aside from offering their hair,
the doctors also offered advice to
parents whose children are suf-
fering from cancer.
"Parents tend to blame them-
selves when their child gets can-
cer," Dunbar said. "It's not your
fault."

Hula hooping isn't just for kids any-
more.
Starting Tuesday, Balanced Body will
offer a Hula hooping dance class for stu-
dents.
"Hooping is fantastic for weight loss,"
said fitness instructor Jodi Jainchill. "You
get a nice, flat tummy from it."
Her adult class, which began Thurs-
day, is also available to students if they
can't make the more energetic Tuesday
class.
Both one-hour classes will begin at 6
p.m.
Balanced Body, 108 NW 76th Drive,
will be running a special through the
end of the month for any student who
calls and registers for the class ahead of
its start time.
Classes are usually $10 for students
but will be half-priced until the end of
November.

cal or treadmill," said Heather Manche,

ing class. "I hate running and cardio, and
hooping works way more muscles."
Jainchill was introduced to hooping
by one of her good friends, Stephanie
Moses, after she noticed Jainchill was
under a lot of stress at the beginning of
this year.
"She said 'Jodi! Your spine!' and
handed me a hoop," Jainchill said.
Moses, Jainchill and their friend
Stephanie Davis became a trio of hoop-
ers, making their own weighted Hula
hoops available during class or able to
be purchased for $30 online at Jainchill's
Web site, www.hoopsandhealth.com.
This will be the first hoop dance class
to be offered at Balanced Body.
Jainchill hopes to keep the class size
small in order to provide a more intimate
setting so she can help people individu-
ally.
"A lot of people can't move because
as life goes on, they get stressed and in-
secure, and it makes the spine stiff," Jain-
chill said. "The human body was meant

Film director to

Alligator Staff Writer
ckeenan@alligator org
Director and producer Brett Ratner will be stop-
ping by Tuesday at 8 p.m. to speak at the University
Auditorium.
Ratner, who was brought by Accent Speakers Bu-
reau, will talk about his career and give students ad-
vice on life after college.
Ratner attended New York University and since
then has directed more than 100 music videos and
eight movies, including "Red Dragon," "X-Men: The
Last Stand" and "Rush Hour."
"Not everyone may want to be a di-
On rector, but you have to have your ownCampus goals," he said.
Ratner, who is originally from Mi-
ami, said most of his high school friends attended UF,
and he has always wanted to visit Gainesville.
Although he is done with school, Ratner said he
is continually learning and improving his skills as a
storyteller.
"I have so much more to learn and more to do,"
he said. "You never really feel like you've achieved
anything because there is always someone better than
you.
However, he said passion has been the key to his
success so far.
"I'm not afraid to fail," he said. "And if I'm able
to communicate that to some college kids, then that's
great too."

of all the efforts leading up to the occasion.

Garby, a UF health studies senior, has a

Students protest workers' pay
By ERIN JESTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two dozen protesters stood squinting into the sun
at the intersection of Southwest 34th Street and Hull
Road Saturday morning, chanting "Justice now!" and
holding signs that read "Hasta la Victoria" -"On-
ward to Victory."
The group was made up of members of the Student
Farmworker Coalition, the National Farm Worker
Ministry, Youth and Young Adults and the Farm La-
bor Organizing Committee, including students from
UF and the University of Central Florida.
Their cause: justice for tobacco farmworkers in
North Carolina who suffer low wages and poor
working conditions at the hands of Big Tobacco.
The rally came on the heels of a Student Senate
resolution calling for a pay increase and better treat-
ment of Immokalee farmworkers, who pick the toma-
toes used by Aramark, UF's food provider.
"Somebody's got to fight for social justice," said
UF junior Justin Wooten.
The UF Foundation held its fall board meeting Sat-
urday at the Hilton UF Conference Center. Roberta
Perry, a National Farm Worker Ministry community
organizer, said it was rumored Susan Ivey would be
attending.
Ivey, a UF alumna and UF Foundation board
member, is the CEO of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Com-pany, the second-largest tobacco company in the
country.
Perry said Ivey has refused so far to meet with the
Farm Labor Organizing Committee to address the
plight of the farm workers.
"R.J. Reynolds has a corporate responsibility
to monitor what happens in the fields," Perry said.
"What we're asking for is a conversation between R.J.
Reynolds and the farmworkers."
Although the farmworkers are
employed by private growers, R.J.
Reynolds buys the tobacco from
the farms, making them ultimately
responsible for the workers at the
bottom, said UCF student Domin-
ique Aulisio.
By demonstrating in front of the
,i board meeting's venue, the protest-Ivey ers said they hoped to show Ivey
that farm workers' issues are important and should
be recognized by tobacco companies.
"This is definitely a state that is anchored in farm
workers' issues," said Lauren Gill, a UCF student and
vice president of Youth and Young Adults' Orlando
chapter.
Although Ivey wasn't in attendance at the meet-
ing, the students handed out informational fliers to
the board, including UF President Bernie Machen,
who told them he would make sure Ivey got a flier.STEP, from page 1

Blue-doggy style
Democrats shouldn't
bend on key issues
U Saturday night, the House of Representatives passed
weeping health care legislation in what President Ba-
rack Obama called "an historic moment for our nation
and for American families."
Historic, no doubt, but it maybe remembered as -and is al-
ready being painted as in the media -a bill full of concessions
that still will not bridge the partisan divide.
According to The Associated Press, the close 220-215 major-
ity included only one Republican, while 39 Democrats voted
against the bill.
A main point of contention between liberal Democrats and
their more conservative Democratic colleagues is abortion ac-
cess. As the public option would provide government-funded
health care to millions of Americans, some "blue-dog" Demo-
crats oppose the idea of spending federal dollars on abortions.
But because private insurance plans often cover abortions,
most Democrats are in favor of providing these services. Not
to mention the fact that those who would benefit most from the
public option, low- and middle-income Americans who earn
too much to qualify for Medicaid, are part of the population that
most often needs access to abortions.
With a strong majority in the House and a near supermajor-
ity in the Senate, why do the Democrats feel it necessary to bend
so much on critical issues, only to face the same Republican op-
position they would without the concessions?
Do dissenting "blue-dogs" pose such a threat to the passage
of key legislation?
The Democratic Party needs to steal a play out of the Repub-
lican playbook and whip its voting block into lock-step if they
hope to pass any substantial legislation.
Otherwise, the Democratic majority will be wasted at this
pivotal time in American history.
Waging War
The closest that the aver-age UF student comes to
seeing the working con-
ditions on an American farm
is the occasional visit to Farm-
Ville. (Well, for some unfortu-
nate souls, this has become an
all-too-frequent visit.)
While the riveting game is
enough to capture the atten-
tion of more than 60 million
Facebook users (we still don't
know how), it lacks a few cru-
cial elements of reality.
Most glaring among them
is the absence of farmworkers.
In reality, roughly one million
laborers, many of whom are
unorganized immigrants, toil
on farms every year to pro-
duce food and other consum-
er goods we take for granted.
With the interests of these
too-often invisible farmwork-
ers in mind, a coalition of
student groups met at the UF
Foundation's Fall Board Meet-
ing on Saturday to protest low
wages and poor working con-ditions of tobacco farmwork-
ers in North Carolina.
Rumored to be in atten-
dance was UF alumna Susan
Ivey, CEO of R.J. Reynolds,
the second-largest tobacco
company in the U.S.
With the power a firm like
R.J. Reynolds holds over its
suppliers, labor activists may
find success in lobbying Ivey
for a wage increase plan simi-
lar to the penny-per-pound
surcharge that the Coalition of
Immokalee Workers was able
to squeeze out of fast food
companies like Burger King.
If correctly implemented,
a plan like this could increase
costs for cigarette consum-
ers by trivial amounts, while
dramatically increasing the
wages of farmworkers.
Now if these activists could
lobby FarmVille to incorpo-
rate underpaid, exploited
farmworkers into the game,
maybe UF students would
take notice of this issue.

Republicans should move away from fringe
onservatives are like a group of elephants beingled in circles by circus masters. Slowly, they sway
back and forth, huffing and puffing, only to gain
little ground after completing a circle.
Liberals, on the other hand, are like a herd of don-
keys that swish their tails in frustration, kick up dirt in
each other's eyes and travel in meandering directions
but eventually make progress, ever so slowly, in travel-
ing down whichever road they choose.
Liberals, for better or worse, have been on the right
side of history for some time now. They have stood on
the side of social security, the Clean Water Act, the Vot-
ing Rights Act, the ending of segregation, Medicaid,
Medicare and foreign aid, to name a few.
On Saturday night, liberals in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives showed they were once again on the right
side of history with the passage of H.R. 3962 -a bill
that provides affordable health care for a majority of
Americans.
Before anyone accuses me of cherry picking out of
our history books, let me remind readers that just as
there have been many conservative democrats through-
out our history -39 democrats voted against H.R. 3962
-so have there been many liberal republicans who
have not only supported and enhanced legislations tra-
ditionally seen as cause c6lebre for Democrats, but have
led these progressive grassroots efforts themselves.
With the knowledge of the great progress liberals
have made for our country, I've actually been rooting
for the Republican Party lately. That's not to say I've
"left for the dark side," as one friend told me, but that
I've simply wanted what is best for them -namely to
end their affair with extreme conservatives.
On Election Night 2008, I was actually excited for the
future of the Republican Party.
"Maybe this will be a wake-up call for the Republi-
cans," said the little voice in my head. Maybe, I thought,by 2010 the Republican leadership
would realize that the socially con-
servative, Bible-thumping model
wouldn't work for them as the na-
tion's demographics changed. Per-
haps they would realize that the
Matthew Christ entire "Pro-American" platform
letters@alligator org was a pirate plank that turned off
independents disgusted by cheap
stereotypes and armed with the
knowledge that America's challenges can't be solved by
churlish fantasists who wish to simplify the diversity of
America.
I was so wrong. In the past year, the loonies haven't
been pushed to the curb, they've been elevated as the
national spokespeople for the party. Yet, fret not, 2010
hasn't arrived.
The Florida Senate Race, specifically the Republi-
can Primary leading up to the main race, has become
a microcosm of our national politics. On the moderate
side is Republican Gov. Charlie Crist, who I like not just
because of his policies and leadership as governor, but
because we share a similar pronunciation of our last
name -something that has come in handy when mak-
ing reservations at a packed restaurant. On the rigid
"true conservative" side is former Florida Speaker of
the House Marco Rubio, who has verbally assailed Crist
for accepting federal stimulus dollars -funds that have
saved 30,000 jobs in Florida.
No matter your opinions of these two men, the
choice is clear: One is a moderate, pragmatic Republi-
can (Crist), and the other is not (Rubio).
If Florida truly is a microcosm of national politics,
then 2010 will not just be a pivotal year for the Republi-
cans but for the future of progress.

I left some good friends in that party, but
I knew it was time to work for the country

Guest column
Goldstone Report includes firsthand evidence of war crimes
Because good journalism always tells two sides of the sto-ry, and Friday's guest column by Yoav Mor was less than
half of one side, allow me to clear up a few inaccuracies
printed in the Alligator. This time, let's err on the side of fact
rather than rhetoric.
To start at the beginning, the United Nations Fact Finding
Mission into Gaza had two mandates. The first was rejected for
legal concerns, and the second was a reformulated version. The
mandate referenced in Friday's opinion section was the first,
unused mandate which had a very narrow purpose, namely
"to investigate all violations of international human rights law
and international humanitarian law by the occupying Power,
Israel, against the Palestinian people."
Mary Robinson, the former U.N. high commissioner for hu-
man rights, and Richard Goldstone, the man who eventually
led the Fact Finding Mission into Gaza, categorically rejected
this mandate, saying that it presupposed guilt by Israel.
Upon re-evaluation, the U.N. Human Rights Council is-
sued a new mandate that was accepted by Richard Goldstone
and lauded by Robinson. The actual mandate, used by the Fact
Finding Mission into Gaza when they left for the Palestinian
territories, reads as follows: "to investigate all violations of in-
ternational human rights law and international humanitarian
law that might have been committed." Ultimately, the report
produced evidence of war crimes by both Israel and Hamas.Christine Israel categorically refused to coop-
Schoelihorn erate with the Fact Finding Mission, cit-
ing anti-Israel bias as the reason. TheySpeaking Out refused access to military documents,
interviews with military personal and
access to Israeli sites, and they ignored repeated calls for infor-
mation submission from the U.N. Fact Finding Mission.
Despite this, Richard Goldstone and his team conducted
many interviews with Israeli eyewitnesses to Hamas rocket
fire, heard testimony about the psychological hardship suf-
fered under rocket fire and interviewed Noam Shalit, the father
of a captured Israeli soldier. All of this is public record, and it is
a blatant lie to say that the Goldstone Report contains only tes-
timony of Israeli acts of aggression; either Yoav Mor is ignorant
about the actual background of the Goldstone Report or his in-
terests lie in perpetrating a perverse version of the truth.
How does any of this relate to you? To quote Mor, "The
egregious singling out of one nation repeatedly as an offender
without giving the complete picture of the situation is a miscar-
riage of justice," and this is true. The U.S. has constantly de-
nounced Palestinian actions, organizations, political goals and
ideology while failing to represent the whole picture.
How many students here have even heard of the Goldstone
Report? If you haven't, you are not alone. Although it was a top
story internationally, it received little attention here at home.Richard Goldstone is a Jewish, self-proclaimed Zionist and
an expert in war crimes. He was picked for this missionbecause
his credentials are above reproach. The allegations put forward
in the Goldstone Report are very serious, and they concern all
of us. Every day, a huge amount of your tax dollars go to sup-
porting the Israeli military, and if even half of the allegations
put forward in the Goldstone Report are factual, you should
know that we have shared responsibility in what has occurred.
Just one example of an allegation put forward in the report is
that Israel used white phosphorous in civilian areas. White
phosphorous is a chemical only legally usable in unpopulated
areas; it is used to provide smoke coverage for troops. How-
ever, when white phosphorous comes into contact with skin, it
burns the flesh down to the bone. Israel admits to using white
phosphorous but only in non-populated areas. However, Gaza
is the most densely populated area on Earth; it is only 25 miles
long and about 5 miles wide with 1.5 million people. There are
no unpopulated territories, and the countless pictures online of
Palestinians whose legs, hands and faces have been burnt away
testify to the use of white phosphorous in civilian areas.
So yes, Mor, this report is serious, its allegations are serious
and it has everything to do with human rights. Shame on you
for only hearing half-truths in a situation of life and death.

UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators look to secure
rebounds out of press
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF forward Erik Murphy and the Gators hope to improve on their defensive rotations after giving up 11
first-half offensive rebounds to Division-Il Saint Leo. Florida hosts Webber International tonight at 7.By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Billy Donovan's full-court press
put some pressure on Florida's new-
est players last week.
Looking to experiment with a
variety of lineups, Donovan had his
defense cover the entire the floor
early and often in last week's exhibi-
tion victory against Saint Leo, even
though some of his first-year players
were still adjusting to the system.
"One of the things I committed to
in the exhibition game that probably
wasn't the best thing for our team
was I wanted all of our guys to press
at some point," Donovan said.
The Gators' press was effective at
times, but they gave up some open
shots and found themselves occa-
sionally out of position running back
on defense. As a result, UF gave up
11 first-half offensive rebounds to a
severely undersized opponent.
Overall, however, Donovan was
encouraged by his team's first at-
tempt at full-court pressure.
"Sitting there sometimes, youlook at it and guys aren't rotating
well, but there were a lot of situa-
tions where I think we did a good
job applying pressure," Donovan
said. "There were some broken
plays where we didn't come up with
the ball and they came up with it, or
we rotated correctly and something
crazy happened."
Donovan said he worked with
his players in practice last week to
improve their defensive rotations
out of the press -an area in which
the Gators struggled given their lack
of experience playing together and
the different lineups Donovan used.
UF will get its last chance to do so
before the regular season starts to-
night at 7 in the O'Connell Center
against Webber International.
Junior forward Chandler Par-
sons attributed the team's poor
performance on the defensive glass
in its first exhibition game to a lack
of execution on defense and the 21
3-pointers Saint Leo attempted,
which led to a lot of long rebounds.
"With us pressing and having to
rotate, we were definitely at a disad-

Nobody wants the Heisman
The Heisman Trophy can't bethat ugly.
Maybe it's too heavy to
carry?
Whatever the reason, no one has
emerged as a clear favorite in the
Heisman race 10 weeks in.
The holy trinity of quarterbacks
-Tim Tebow, Colt McCoy and
Sam Bradford -along with Cal
running back Jahvid Best were the
clear preseason favorites, but none
of them have staked a claim to the
little bronze statue.
Bradford went down in Okla-
homa's first game, and Best has dis-
appeared in some big games while
his Golden Bears have struggled to
score points at times.
Tebow and McCoy have put up
some pretty ordinary stats (McCoy
arguably less than ordinary), but
Florida and Texas are both unde-
feated.
For that fact alone, I believe one
of those two senior signal callers
will win the award at season's end,
though neither of them deserve it at
this point in the season.EEvery-
one seems
to be will-
ing to ac-
knowledge

has become

Here is the criteria I consider ev-
ery week when we vote in the alliga-
torSports Heisman Watch:
STATISTICAL EFFICIENCY: Not
just big numbers, but big numbers
relative to the amount of times your
number is called. It's nice for Case
Keenum to throw for 500 yards ev-
eryweek,buthe also throws 60 times
per game. He currently ranks 20th in
yards per attempt. At the same time,
a player has to have a major role on
his team to be considered.

* UF LOST TO SOUTH
CAROLINA 1-0.
By TYLER JETT

ORANGE BEACH, Ala. -
Seven days can make a big
difference.
No. 8 Florida dominated
South Carolina en route to a
regular-season Southeastern
Conference Championship on
Oct. 30. One week later, the
Gamecocks (17-3-1) jumped
on the Gators (15-5-2) early
in the rematch, knocking the
top seed out of the SEC Tour-
nament 1-0 in the semifinals
Friday.The two games could not
have been more different for
the Gators.
In the regular season
matchup, UF scored a pair
of early goals which visibly
shook South Carolina's con-
fidence on the way to a 3-0
Florida win. On Friday, the
Gators played a sloppy first
half and gave the Gamecocks
a chance to land an upset.
"I don't know if we were
as up for it mentally as they
were because that was a big
revenge game for them,"
midfielder Brooke Thigpen
said.
The Gators were out of
sync early. Players failed to
make runs at the ball whenpasses dictated it and -in
the rare case when teammates
were on the same wavelength
-passes were off target.
As a result, South Caroli-
na spent a lot of time in UF's
defensive third.
"They didn't create many
chances, we gave them the
chances," defender Lauren
Hyde said.
She also said Florida's in-
ability to keep possession
made the backline's job more
difficult.
UF turned away the first
couple South Carolina at-
tacks, but the Gamecocks
continued to play near the
Gators' goal, eventually

E So I finally had a chance to make it to my first Bucs game of the season. They
proceeded to pick up their first win of the season. I'm just saying. .There is
nothing that bothers me more than Urban Meyer referring to his team as 19-0.
Unless I'm mistaken, this is not still the '08 season, because if it was, there
would be no way a Dan Mullen-led offense would struggle this bad.

big plays to spark drives. Last week,
three of the Gators' four offensive
touchdowns came on plays of lon-
ger than 20 yards. They only had
three plays longer than 20 yards all
game against the Commodores, one
of which was a 25-yard sprint into
the end zone by Jeff Demps on an
option play on fourth and 1.
UF clinched a birth in the SEC
Championship Game on Dec. 5 last
week, and as its game was just get-
ting started, Alabama beat LSU to
secure the other spot in the game.
Florida coach Urban Meyer
knows by the time that game comes
around his team must be able to
break off big plays like it did in
2008.
"Last year, it seemed all of a sud-
den we would pull one out. We
would get one down the field or
make a long pass. We're just not get-
ting that," Meyer said. "Everybody
is pressing to get that done, and we
need to get that done with the games
coming up."
On the sidelines Saturday were
two former Gators responsible for
many of the long plays last season,
Louis Murphy and Percy Harvin,
whose NFL teams were on bye
weeks.
In every game during the 2008
season, at least one of the two receiv-
ers had a play that gained more than
20 yards, and in six games, both of
them had one.
Harvin said it seems Tebow has
too much pressure on him and is
having to run too much.
Tebow has carried the ball at
least 15 times in all seven conference
games this season compared to just
four all of last season.
"A lot of the explosive plays are
coming from the running backs in-
stead of the wide receivers, and Tim
Tebow is taking too many hits,"
Harvin said after the game. "Theystill have a lot of fire power; they just
need to put it together and take the
pressure off of Tebow."
While the offense found itself
struggling to finish drives with
touchdowns, the Gators' defense
looked as dominant as ever even
without Brandon Spikes, who was
suspended for the game for his eye-
gouging incident against the Bull-
dogs.
For the fifth time this season,
Florida's defense did not allow an
offensive touchdown.
"We gave them a (30)-yard run,
but we bend but we don't break.
That's pretty much our goal this
year," linebacker Ryan Stamper
said. "They are going to make plays,
that's just football, but we try to just
to keep them out of the end zone."
Stamper, who replaced Spikes
at middle linebacker, and fellow
linebacker Dustin
Doe, who started
in Stamper's usual
spot, were the stand-
Football outs on defense.
Doe had a team-
high 11 tackles.
Stamper was second with six and
also added an interception.
Spikes' replacements made the
plays on the field, but Spikes still
found a way to contribute Saturday.
Stamper said Spikes got the play-
ers going with a talk in the locker
prior to the game.
The return of Spikes next week
will only bolster the dominant de-
fense for the SEC Championship
Game against Alabama in less than
a month.
Tebow said he expects the game
to be exciting, but the team will not
be worried about the Crimson Tide
for a few weeks.
The offense will need to fix the
problems that has plagued it all year
before the game that again is likely
to decide which team will play in the
BCS National Championship.1)17 Vanderbilt 3, Florida Zf\R 'L I

not have a starting role when he comes back. We

in for one of the best middle linebackers in the

without an interception then gets one in back-to-

Stamper, and it's starting to show he's more than

Another underwhelming performance by Florida's

beauty. The junior continues to be Tim Tebow's

bottle him up yet, we doubt anything will change

UF will learn NCAA seeding Monday night
SOCCER, from page 13
drawing a foul inside the box when Hol-
ly King and Kat Williamson sandwiched
South Carolina's Lindsay Small.
The ensuing penalty kick was taken by
Kim Miller, and she placed the ball per-
fectly in the upper-left corner of the goal,
giving goalkeeper Katie Fraine no chance
to record a save and ending Florida's five-
game shutout streak.
In a sport where one goal can make all
the difference, Miller's strike was enough
for the Gamecocks.
Coach Becky Burleigh shifted the
team's alignment in the second half, tak-
ing a player out of the defensive midfield
position and adding a forward. UF started
creating chances after halftime, but it was
unable to capitalize.
Florida's closest shot came in the 48th
minute when sophomore Lindsay Thomp-
son took a left-footed shot from 18 yards
out that banged off the top crossbar.
Burleigh has said in the past that teamstry to force the tempo when trailing, but
she said the team played with good com-
posure even while behind Friday.
"We played as well in the second half
as we did (last week) in Gainesville," Bur-
leigh said.
Regardless, Florida found itself in a
Soccerrace against the clock late in
the game. The team had sev-
eral opportunities, especially
in the last ten minutes when
the ball stayed on South Car-
olina's side of the field for
almost the entire time. But the ball never
found South Carolina's net.
For the second consecutive year, the
Gators failed to reach the tournament fi-
nals after winning the regular season SEC
championship.
Florida's next game will be Friday, al-
though its opponent will not be revealed
until Monday night, when the seeding
for the NCAA tournament will be an-
nounced.Defender Lauren Hyde said Florida errors were to blame for a lot of South Carolina's
offensive chances. The Gamecocks' goal came on a penalty kick in the 11th minute.
KYLE, from page 13_
TEAM SUCCESS: This isn't to say
just pure wins and losses, but rather
the effect a player has on his team's
chances of winning. Tebow was the
clear winner in 2007, and his team
lost four games. He shouldn't have
been penalized for that, as he was
doing everything he could and then
some to help his team win. Still, it
would be hard to pick a winner from
a team hovering around .500.
LEVEL OF OPPOSITION: Com-
petition certainly matters, but notas much as the other two criteria
to me. Putting up gaudy stats and
wins against good teams certainly
scores you bonus points, and simi-
lar outputs against crappy teams
don't quite count as much -Jordan
Shipley's 273 yards against UCF this
weekend shouldn't be counted the
same way as Mark Ingram's 174 to-
tal yards against LSU.
U U U
Even with some set of guidelines,
it's still easy to see that picking a
winner is an inexact science. Made
even more inexact by a clustered
field of candidates here in 2009.
With all that said, there are threeplayers that I believe would have
legitimate cases if the season ended
today.
KELLEN MOORE, BOISE STATE: He
is by definition the most statistically
efficient quarterback as his passer
rating of 169.3 is the best in the na-
tion. His 27 touchdown passes ranks
him second against his three inter-
ceptions. The Broncos are undefeat-
ed and ranked No.6 in the latest BCS
standings. Moore is hurt by playing
in the WAC, but he led his team to a
win against Oregon, giving him one
of the best signature wins of all the
candidates.MARK INGRAM, ALABAMA: He is
fifth in nation in rushing yards and
his 6.6 yards per carry ranks him
11th in the nation, making him bru-
tally efficient as a ball carrier. He has
added more than 200 yards receiv-
ing and has accounted for 11 total
touchdowns. The Crimson Tide are
also undefeated and ranked No. 2 in
the latest BCS. He plays in the SEC,
so not much needs to be said for the
level of competition.
CJ. SPILLER, CLEMSON: He does
everything for his team. Spiller has
rushed for 739 yards, caught for 334
yards and has piled up 721 returnyards. The tailback has scored five
rushing touchdowns, three receiv-
ing, three on kickoff returns and one
on a punt return.
The Tigers have gone 6-3 in their
nine games, but looking at the game
log makes Spiller's season more
impressive. His two worst games
have come against Middle Tennes-
see State and Coastal Carolina when
he touched the ball a combined nine
times on offense. Spiller has essen-
tially taken off the team's only two
cupcake games which are usually
so instrumental in piling up Heis-
man statistics, yet he has done that
anyway.

vantage, but we've still got to
come up with the ball," Parsons
said.
Some of the Gators' new-
est players -Vernon Macklin,
Erik Murphy and Rod Tishman
-found themselves occasion-
ally confused and making the
wrong rotations, as they were
still learning the system. Dono-
van likely will not force them
to press in the regular season
until they are comfortable, but
he wanted to get everyone in-volved during the preseason.
"If we don't have a great
pressing team in there, I'm
probably not going to press
as much as I did in the game
against Saint Leo," he said.
The Gators' best pressing
team, Donovan said, will in-
clude Erving Walker, Kenny
Boynton, Ray Shipmanand Dan
Werner. Junior power forward
Alex Tyus and center Vernon
Macklin can fill the fifth spot, as
both are athletic enough to con-
sistently run the floor.
Fortunately for Donovan,UF's versatility will allow him
to adjust his defense based on
what lineup he wants to play,
or vice versa. For example, he
said, Boynton, Parsons, Wer-
ner, Tyus and Macklin may not
create the most effective press-
ing lineup, but their length and
athleticism would work to their
advantage in a zone scheme.
"That's one of the things as
a coaching staff we're working
through right now -looking
at different lineups for what is
the best defense for us to play,"
Donovan said.
Florida wraps up fall schedule
0 MEN AND WOMEN ARE OFF UNTIL
TEAM PLAY IN MID-JANUARY.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Despite enjoying only marginal success in
the final grand slam event of the fall season, the
Florida coaches have to be pleased with how the
fall season went as a whole.
While a plethora of injuries and illnesses kept
a number of top players relatively inactive, they
also opened up opportunities for Alex Lacroix,
Allie Will, and Lauren Embree to shine.
Will established a 20-3 singles record, includ-
ing a win at the ITA Southeast Regional and a
quarterfinal appearance at the ITA All-Amer-
ican, while fellow freshman Embree notched a
12-2 mark and also reached the quarterfinals of
the All-American.After Will's performance in the ITA South-
east Regional, women's coach Roland Thorn-
qvist called her fall season one of the best he's
seen from a freshman. Embree's wasn't too far
behind.
Thornqvist is confident about his team's
depth heading into the spring season.
"I feel very good about our depth. We have
a lot of good players, so I feel re-
ally good about our team and
where we have a chance to be,"
Thornqvist said.Tenn iS On the men's side, Lacroix
established a 14-3 mark, includ-
ing a quarterfinal appearance in the All-Ameri-
can and a sweep of the ITA Indoor consolation
bracket.
"He's obviously somebody that's going to
have a chance to win the NCAA. It doesn't sur-

Gators clean up errors

Early in the season it was a
weakness, but now attack errors,
or lack thereof, have become a
huge reason for the Gators' suc-
cess.
After averaging 19.27 errors
per match over the first 15 con-
tests of the season, Florida has
cut that number to 10.5 per match
during its eight-match winning
streak.
Just one match after hitting
a season-best six errors in a 3-0
sweep of Georgia (16-10, 6-9
Southeastern Conference) on Fri-
day (25-16, 25-20, 25-14), No. 9 UF
(20-3, 14-2 SEC) maintained its
mistake-free play.
That season-low was short
lived as the Gators recorded only
four attack errors Sunday against
Auburn (14-12, 6-9 SEC) to grab
their eighth-straight sweep (25-
15, 25-18, 25-13).
"Earlier in the season we were
capable of making 10 hitting er-
rors in one game, and that shows
the maturing process of this
team," coach Mary Wise said.
Junior setter Brynja Rodgers
was not available for Sunday'smatch against the Tigers because
of back spasms, which left sopho-
more Kelly Murphy as the lone
setter.
The injury forced the Gators to
go away from their usual two-set-
ter offense and play with one set-
ter for the first time this season.
But it looked as if Murphy had
been playing this type of scheme
the whole year as she dished out
30 assists and helped limit the
attack errors to
only four.
"The team re-
sponded great.
We've practiced
Kelly running
a five-one of-
fense, but we
Wise just haven't done
it for an entire
match," Wise said. "Today we did
it, and now when we go to it in
a match we are going to be that
much better because of this."
However, the Gators did face
some adversity against Auburn
as they found themselves trailing
2-8 in the second set. It didn't last
long. Sophomore outside hitter
Colleen Ward knocked down five
kills in the frame to help UF storm
back to win the set and grab con-
trol of the match.
