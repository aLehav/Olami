Eight hundred and twenty-ﬁ  ve dancers celebrate the $1,169,722.16 raised for the Children’s Miracle Network through Dance Marathon after dancing for 26.2 hours in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.

Sunday afternoon, 825 sleep-deprived UF students 
lined up to thrust their hips and ﬂ  ail their arms one 
last time. As they were shaking in unison to a cho-reographed line dance on the Stephen C. O’Connell Center ﬂ  oor, Gator basketball star Will Yeguete lifted toddlers to help them dunk in a lone basketball hoop in the corner, and 6-year-old Zander Wyant threw a beach ball around with a few Dance Marathon staff members.
Zander and his father, Chris Wyant, shaved “DM” 
and “UF” into their heads for this year’s event.
In 2006, Zander was born in Tallahassee with a 
heart condition and was ﬂ  own to Shands Hospital for Children at UF just hours later.
He is one of the 50 Miracle Children who repre-
sented Shands Hospital for Children at UF, Gaines-ville’s local Children’s Miracle Network hospital, at UF’s 19th annual Dance Marathon, which raised a record-breaking $1,169,722.16.
“We don’t set fundraising goals,” said Nicole Mar-
tinez, a 21-year-old advertising junior and head of the public relations team for this year’s UF Dance Mara-thon. “Even if we were to raise one more dollar than last year, we would be ecstatic. It’s all for the kids.”
Last year’s event raised about $886,000 for pediat-
ric research and equipment for Shands — 87 percent of which was raised through individual donations.
The dancers at the 26.2-hour event spent the past 
year soliciting donations from friends, family mem-bers and generous strangers. Jittery and anxious, they gathered at the O’Connell Center on Saturday morn-ing ready to stand for more than a day.Dance Marathon raises more than $1 million

Wayne Wheeler stood inside his 
mostly empty trailer in Westgate Mobile 
Manor Park.
His furniture was piled in a truck, 
ready to be taken to a Dumpster.
Raccoon tracks lined the linoleum, 
carpet and top of Wheeler’s DVD player. They’re the only remnants of the three raccoons that lived with Wheeler until Friday morning, when Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission of-ﬁ  cials took them away after one of the raccoons scratched a woman.
Wheeler, 47, said he was in the Butler Plaza Publix parking lot Tuesday with his raccoons — Sister Rikki, Sheba and Eli — who traveled with him in his van.
A woman approached Wheeler and 
wanted to hold Sheba, the smallest of the trio. Wheeler doesn’t usually let people hold the animals but decided to allow it. Sheba climbed on the woman, her friend took pictures, and the two walked away. Wheeler said another woman walked by his van soon after.
Because Sheba had already climbed 
on one person, she assumed it was OK to climb on the woman, he said.
Sheba jumped through the van win-Pets of ‘Raccoon Man’

For UF adjunct professors, it’s great to be a 
Florida Gator.
While some universities might be cutting 
adjunct professors’ hours, UF will not.
Beginning in 2014, the Affordable Care Act, 
also known as Obamacare, states that anyone 
working more than 30 hours per week is con-sidered a full-time employee and is mandated to receive healthcare from his or her employer.
To avoid this requirement, some colleges 
have cut adjunct hours.
Paula Fussell, UF’s vice president for human 
resource services, said she is surprised other in-stitutions are cutting hours because universities 
are expecting to get some funding for tempo-
rary employee insurance.
“There is no plan at UF to reduce hours re-
lated to insurance,” she said.UF employs about 140 adjunct professors 
this semester, Fussell said. The average salary ranges from $38,000 to $47,000, according to www.glassdoor.com.
Because of their considerably lower salaries, 
universities have opted to hire adjuncts instead 
of tenure-track faculty.
Wayne Wanta, chair for 
the UF Department of Jour-nalism, said the number of adjuncts teaching in his de-partment does not comply with the crediting standards because full-time faculty are supposed to teach a majority of the classes.
“The budget isn’t big enough for full-time 
faculty to teach all of the classes,” he said. “We are very fortunate with the quality of adjuncts that we have.”
Michelle Hinson, a public relations adjunct 
professor, said she gets paid $3,200 per class.
“They love adjuncts here at UF,” she said. 
“We don’t cost as much as full-time faculty.”UF adjunct profs won’t get cuts

Two UF anti-war groups staged a peaceful protest 
after the first bombing of North Vietnam in four years. The Vietnam Veterans Against the War and Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam 
assembled on the Plaza of the Americas and marched 
toward the federal building downtown. The message of the nearly 200 protesters was to halt all bombing and to withdraw from Southeast Asia.
April 17, 1985Two UF alumnae and a UF graduate student were 
chosen from a group of semifinalists to represent Florida in the national Teacher in Space program. The 
winner would get to ride along during a space shuttle 
mission in 1986 and then tour the country for a year afterward to promote the shuttle program. About 11,000 teachers from across the country applied.
April 17, 1996Floridian funeral directors sought to change the 
age criteria for burials and death certificates. The law at the time was vague and didn’t clearly state the legal 
procedures for burials of fetuses fewer than 20 weeks 
old at the time of death. The change they proposed would allow hospitals to offer memorial services to mothers who miscarried early on in pregnancy.  
April 14, 2003About 60 alligators found new homes after being 
auctioned off. The 5-foot fiberglass gators were part of the Gator Trails public art project. The auction raised

at $7,000. The money went to reimburse the artists and went to Destination Enhancement, an initiative to promote the arts throughout the country.

The development of a new blue-light 
emergency mobile application funded 
by Student Government will put the technology of the blue-light poles on campus directly into the hands of stu-
dents. A single tap will alert authorities with GPS location, said Cristian Aran-
go, director of Nightlife Navigators.
“It’s like having a blue light with 
you wherever you go,” said Jennifer Ryder, an 18-year-old pre-pharmacy freshman, “in case you don’t want to set people off, like by calling 911, be-cause sometimes that can trigger some-thing worse.”
Since January, students and admin-
istrators have been working together to bring the app to life. The idea came af-ter releasing the SNAP UF app, which allows students to request and track a Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol van, said Arango, a 20-year-old history and political science junior.
However, SG and Nightlife Naviga-
tors are still working on funding and finding a company to build it. 
Arango said he hopes the app will 
be released during the Summer.
“Would I like the app to come soon-
er than the middle of Fall? Yes. I would like to test it out this Summer with the incoming freshmen,” he said. Blue-light app team hopes for green lightParticipants were taught 
a line dance at the begin-
ning of the event, which they performed every hour to show support for children at Shands.
UF marketing freshman and 
novice dancer Nakisa Behi, 19, was in high spirits Saturday afternoon.
“Yeah, 26.2 hours is a long 
time,” she said, “but I didn’t realize how excited the kids got, and that made me even more excited to start dancing.”
Behi wasn’t the only one showing off her dance moves at the event.
“For me, what was special 
was the [Miracle Children’s] talent show,” Zander said. “I danced a lot.”
Chris Wyant and his wife, 
Krissy Wyant, said their son has more friends in college than in kindergarten, and he looks forward to seeing them at Dance Marathon every year.
“Last year after the event, 
we’re in the car, and he asks us, ‘We’re coming back next weekend, right?’ and that so-lidifies it,” Chris Wyant said. “They mean so much to him.”KELCEE GRIFFIS

Connor Donlin and Coral 
Munkittrick made memories at prom 
that will stick. Instead of the tradi-tional tux and gown, the two Santa Fe High School students showed up at the Best Western Plus Gate-way Grand hotel on Friday wearing clothes made from duct tape.
“It was rather labor-intensive — 
hours of just leaning over a table and taping,” said Donlin, an 18-year-old senior. “I lost many hours of sleep over it, but it was fantastic at the same time.”
The unusual ensemble was in-
spired by a Duck Tape-sponsored scholarship contest that will award the winning couple with $5,000 
scholarships.
Unraveled, the clothes consisted 
of 33 rolls —  930 yards —  of beige, 
blue, gold and clear tape.
Overall, Donlin said his suit took 
about 80 hours to finish, more than double the time Munkittrick’s dress took.
“I have many, many more layers 
than she does,” Donlin said.  
Munkittrick, a 17-year-old junior, 
hot-glued embellishments to her dress and, on Friday night, pinned 
a Duck Tape butterfly to her hair.  
Even her matching blue-and-beige 
nail art was fashioned from tape.
After they submit photos to the 
contest, Donlin and Munkittrick will wait until June, when judges will post the top 10 entries online. People can vote for their favorites, and the winners will be announced in July.
Regardless of the outcome, Nan-
cy Gillman, a Santa Fe High School English teacher, said the couple set a precedent for the school.
“I heard of the scholarship sev-
eral years ago, and I didn’t believe it,” she said. “[Donin] and his girl-friend were the first to … ever fol-low through.”

Seek the truth.
That was the course of ac-
tion Carl Bernstein urged in his speech at UF Hillel on Saturday night. The Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter talked Israeli politics and media cov-
erage before a roughly 150-per-
son crowd of Florida Loves Israel conference attendees, journalism 
students and elderly men.
Bernstein, famous for his 
work on the Watergate scan-dal with Bob Woodward, said his approach in those days was to publish the best obtainable version of the truth — a motive that should also be applied to the situation in Israel.
“We need information,” 
Bernstein said. “We need to get past the propaganda ... We need to find out what’s going on.”
He told attendees to inves-
tigate opposing points of view and work to understand every possible aspect of the conflict.
Being pro-Israel, he said, is 
a commitment to knowledge.
“If we, as American Jews, 
do the work, Israel is more se-cure,” Bernstein said.
UF student Ben Swerdlow 
said he agreed with Bernstein’s 
thoughts on journalism.
“Journalism should be 
about getting the best ver-
sion of the truth, not getting 
the most viewers,” said the 
20-year-old materials science 
and engineering sophomore. “And there’s not as much of that as there should be.”
Conference chairwoman 
Alyssa Baron, a 20-year-old UF business administration sophomore, said the event was a success.
For his part, Bernstein was 
as impressed with the audi-ence members as they were with him.
“I thought the students 
were great,” he said after the 
speech. “They seemed really 
open to thinking a little bit dif-ferently, perhaps, than they have been led to think they 
should think.”

Researchers in Germany have recently 
reported finding traces of arsenic in samples 
of beer, saying that some levels found were more than twice what is allowed in drinking water.
The danger is in the filtration of the alco-hol. Brewers use diatomaceous earth to give beer a clearer, lighter appearance, which is where the arsenic comes from, according to published reports.
But Gainesville locals have no reason to 
fear about the chemical in the beer, said Andy 
Bielecki, bar manager at Swamp Head Brew-
ery, a microbrewery located at 3140 SW 42nd Way.“The filtering is what caused the arsenic, 
and we don’t have those issues,” he said. “The only beer we filter is our Wild Night, and we don’t use the same techniques they do to filter ours.”
Bielecki said he considers the study alarm-
ing but thinks the biggest issues will come from macrobreweries because they make lighter beers that require clearer appearances.
Andrew Spinnenweber, a 22-year-old UF 
advertising senior, said if he knew the beer he drank contained arsenic, he wouldn’t buy it. Study finds sobering information about arsenic in beer
Now lonely, Wheeler plans to move
dow onto the woman and left a small scratch her arm.
According to a vaccination record from a local vet, 
all three animals received rabies vaccinations in August 2012, which Wheeler explained to the woman.
“If these raccoons are sick, I would’ve been sick years 
ago,” said Wheeler, who often slept with the raccoons and kissed them on the mouth.
However, several days after the incident, the woman 
became concerned about the scratches, and the Alachua County Health Department got involved, said FWC in-vestigator Ken Holmes.
The department obtained a court order to confiscate 
the animals, Holmes said, and on Friday, FWC inves-tigators showed up at Wheeler’s trailer to take the rac-
coons away.
“It was probably the hardest hit from life I have ever 
had,” Wheeler said.
Once animals are confiscated under suspicion of 
rabies, Holmes said, the usual process is to euthanize 
and decapitate the animals for brain testing. He added there’s currently no accurate method of testing for rabies in live animals.
“It was an unfortunate thing to do, especially for the 
animals,” he said, “but Mr. Wheeler was told explicitly about it, and he chose to not heed the warnings.”
Commercial license holders are allowed to exhibit 
animals in a controlled manner, Holmes said, but Wheel-er’s commercial license expired in September.
Holmes said he warned Wheeler he shouldn’t have 
been in possession of the raccoons and shouldn’t have been exhibiting them after his license expired in Septem-ber.
Holmes issued Wheeler a $50 citation and said he 
will file a misdemeanor charge directly with the state at-
torney’s office for injury to a member of the public.
In response to the incident, Wheeler said he’s getting 
an attorney and moving out of his trailer. It’s too lonely 
without Sister Rikki, Sheba and Eli.
However, Wheeler said he’s a man of faith and be-
lieves this happened for a reason.
“Everything is going to be all right,” he said. “There’s 
always a challenge before a change.”

� NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA HAS 
EXPERIENCED HABITAT DEGRADATION.
ALYSSA NIEVES

Turtles can re-establish themselves in the face of a 
declining habitat, given a sufficient amount of time and 
relief from harvesting, according to new research from the Florida Museum of Natural History.
In 1969, Max Nickerson, herpetology curator for 
the museum and co-author of the study, said he, along with researchers, began monitoring the northern map turtle population in a spring-fed river system in the Ozark region of Missouri. However, in 1980, they dis-covered something was wrong.
The number of female turtles in the area was not 
what it should have been, Nickerson said. The research-ers received word from locals that harvesters had been capturing the turtles to sell in the turtle meat market.
It wasn’t until 2007 that the population returned to 
its 1969 levels.
“A lot of turtle biologists have not thought it would 
be possible for turtle populations to turn around like this,” he said. “Of course, the timeline is a little lengthy.”
Both Missouri and North Central Florida have some 
of the highest concentrations of major springs in North America, and both have experienced habitat degrada-
tion, Nickerson said.
Eric Suarez, a 27-year-old UF wildlife ecology and 
conservation graduate student, said biologists need to 
do a better job educating the public on turtle popula-tion decline.
“People should care in the largest sense because 
they are disrupting food webs and food chains,” he said.Turtles power

1) In your view, how would the soft 
closing of bars work?
BRADDY: If it’s implemented, it’s 
only because we have taken the steps 
to mitigate what might be negative im-
pacts. Any policy change will bring both pros and cons, and I think, for commis-sioners, what they would be looking for is will the pros outweigh the cons. I‘ve talked to some people about best-stan-dards practices for the clubs and every-thing, and all of that may be too much to ask for right away. But if it moves in 
that direction, that’s where I think — at 
least where I would be, as well as prob-ably other commissioners — is how do we mitigate or lessen the impacts so that such a change could be made?
LOWE: As it worked previously, 
there was a time at which alcohol sales were stopped, but the establishment could stay open for an hour or two 
after that, during which time nonal-
coholic beverages could be sold —  in-cluding water —  and those that were there could dance or continue to talk to friends, socialize up until the establish-ment did have to close, according to the city ordinance. That is what a soft clos-ing would entail. I have been a longtime supporter of soft closing.2) What would you do to keep 
Gainesville graduates in the local job market?
BRADDY: It’s a matter of creating the 
atmosphere. I’m not one of these people who believes government creates jobs. The best we can do is lower the barriers 
to entry. Those aren’t necessarily finan-
cial or even monetary. Sometimes, it’s just time-oriented. So, if we can do that, we create that atmosphere, that environ-ment. Then, I think a lot of people, a lot of college students, would want to stay. It’s a great place to live. That’s what hap-pened to me. I’m a college student, came here and never really left.
LOWE: We need to bring in compa-
nies that will hire University of Florida graduates and Santa Fe College gradu-ates and allow them to stay in the Gainesville area and contribute to our local economy, and in turn create ad-ditional jobs in our community so that all of our residents can benefit. Recent UF graduates, longtime residents of all 
levels of educational attainment can en-
joy the economy that we’re developing due to companies that are locating to Gainesville because they recognize the high quality of life that we’ve built over the past decade or so.
3) Why would you be the best 
candidate for students to vote for?
BRADDY: I want students engaged 
in the civic life of the city, and I’ve pro-posed everything from student intern-ships to even setting aside kind of a student-oriented bid process. When we do things through our PR and through the communications wing and others, why not let students have the first crack at that, and not just the university, but 
also Santa Fe [College] students. We’ve got so much talent in this community. 
I would actually work to bring them into civic life, having internships at all different department levels and then actually trying to tap into their creative ideas and utilize that to help benefit all of Gainesville. Imagine what it would 
mean for a student if they’re interview-
ing a few years down the road with a Fortune 500 company, and they can say on their resume, ‘Look. I did this for the City of Gainesville.’ So, that’s what I’d do. The incumbent has no such propos-als.
LOWE:  I recognize that students are 
affected by the decisions that we make 
in city government, and while they may 
or may not be here in four to six years, they are voting on behalf of those who may come after. But the fact is, none of us knows where we will be in four to six years. And I am the candidate that en-courages students to get involved in our community and to vote. And if you look at those who are supporting my oppo-
nent, they actually advocated for legisla-
tion at the state level with the very intent of keeping students from voting in elec-tions. And that was actually inspired by the last mayor’s race here in Gainesville. There was a bill that was sponsored by Dennis Baxley at the urging of Stafford Jones to discourage students from vot-ing. In particular, they cited Gainesville 
city elections. They don’t want students 
to vote, and I need students to vote to make our community a better place. Stu-dents, like everyone, look for a commu-nity with a quality of life, with a healthy environment, with abundant natural ar-eas, with a high degree of public safety and also a very active entertainment scene. And in Gainesville, we’re looking 
to continue that.

104 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Did you participate in Dance Marathon?Many of you (in fact, probably all of you) may not have 
heard, but the quiz bowl community was rocked by a huge scandal recently when it was revealed that 
Andy Watkins, a key contributor on four national champi-onship teams during his time at Harvard, had cheated at all 
four of those tournaments.
Let me give some background information so the above 
sentence makes sense. Quiz bowl is a game that tests aca-
demic knowledge in the most rigorous way possible while still being, you know, a game. Each match, played between two teams of up to four people each, consists of 20 tossup questions.
A tossup is a ﬁ  ve-to-seven-line paragraph read aloud to 
both teams. Anyone on either team can buzz in at any time 
and say an answer. If they’re right, they’re awarded 10 points 
and their team is read a shorter three-part bonus question worth up to 30 points. Tossups are structured so the most ob-scure information about the answer is given ﬁ  rst, then more well-known facts, leading to the easiest clues at the end.
For example, if there was a tossup about me, it would 
start out by saying, “This guy was once compared to Tim Tebow by a confused and angry Internet commenter,” then would end with a giveaway clue like, “Name this Alligator 
columnist who no one reads anymore because he’s crazy.”
You get the idea. At the highest levels of collegiate quiz 
bowl, the questions get tough. To be a good collegiate quiz 
bowl player requires hours upon hours of study. The reason people are willing to invest the time is not money or awe-some prizes; the best prize I’ve ever gotten from a quiz bowl tournament was a sweet used copy of a bilingual edition of Pablo Neruda’s selected poetry.
No, people invest time and effort into quiz bowl tourna-
ments because they like to learn. Quiz bowlers are an intel-lectually curious bunch. We’ll spend hours reading about the history of Australia on Wikipedia because we randomly hear about some Australian prime minister who shotgunned two and a half pints of beer in 11 seconds.
I guess “nerds” is an applicable term, but I prefer “intel-
lectually curious” because the word “nerd” gives me ’Nam-like ﬂ  ashbacks to fourth-grade recess.The reason this rocked the 
intellectually curious commu-nity is that it’s an absolutely senseless act of idiocy. Let me explain how he cheated. Andy 
had access to the website of the 
company (National Academic Quiz Tournaments — NAQT for short) that writes the ques-tions for the national champi-
onship because NAQT runs a championship for high school-ers, and he was one of the editors of the high school questions. Being a smart guy, he was able to exploit a loophole in the servers to see the beginning clues of all the questions for the 
college championship. As you can imagine, this gave him a 
teensy competitive advantage over the other teams.
NAQT was recently reviewing its server logs after a much 
less clever player used the same loophole to very conspicu-ously cheat last year, and they uncovered a repeated pattern of access that would explain what quiz bowlers had previ-ously described as “Andy’s NAQT boost.”
You see, people in quiz bowl know what others are ca-
pable of. They’d seen Andy play. His play at those national 
championships was suspiciously better than anything else 
he did at other tournaments.  It was ofﬁ  cially chalked up to “like, I dunno, really good coffee or whatever” and pushed out of mind. Now the quiz bowl world is half in shock, half blindly furious. Because, remember, there is no money in-volved. No scholarships. Very little prestige. The only thing at stake in a quiz bowl match is the match itself.
What Andy violated is the community: the people who 
played with and against him, the people who put money and 
time into learning things the hard way. And those people are 
angry because, let’s face it: Why would you cheat to win a game played for fun? Look, it all comes down to one simple truth: Cheating makes games not fun for people who don’t cheat. Don’t cheat! Duh! Everyone will hate you! And trust me, being hated gets old quick.
Dallin Kelson is an English senior at UF. His column runs on 
Mondays.Cheating to win is kinda lame, dummy  We think Justin Bieber is about to reach levels of insanity that match Britney Spears in the early hours of 2008.
“Yesterday night Justin Bieber visited the Anne 
Frank House, together with his friends and guards,” reads a Fa-cebook post from the Anne Frank House this weekend. “Fans 
were waiting outside to see a glimpse of him. He stayed more 
than an hour in the museum. In our guestbook he wrote: ‘Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hope-fully she would have been a belieber.’”
Put yourself in his shoes for, like, just a second.You’re a super-popular, super-rich, super-famous pop star. 
You’ve recently gone through a very public breakup. You’ve lashed out at paparazzi. Would you choose this sensitive time in your life to be even more of an idiot by wishing that Anne Frank 
would’ve been a “belieber”?
“The suggestion that had she lived today, the teenager would 
have been a ‘belieber’ — a term used by his devoted fans to de-
scribe themselves — generated thousands of horriﬁ  ed responses on social networking websites,” according to an article by the BBC. “‘Just saw what Justin Bieber wrote in the Anne Frank Mu-seum guestbook. Absolutely disgusted,’ read one tweet. ‘Way to turn an inspiring moment into something about yourself,’ read another.”
“Annemarie Bekker, a spokeswoman for the Anne Frank 
House, said museum ofﬁ  cials were ‘a bit overwhelmed’ by the negative reaction to Bieber’s statement,” reported Reuters.
“He’s a 19-year-old boy taking the effort to come and see the 
museum, and we’d like to point that out, and I think it’s quite innocent what he put down,” Bekker said, according to the ar-ticle.
We appreciate Bekker’s attempt to defend him, but we feel 
Bieber’s comment reﬂ  ects something a bit deeper than an inno-
cent wish that someone would be his fan.
“Bieber has had a tough few weeks in Europe,” wrote the 
Associated Press, via the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “He had to leave a 
monkey in quarantine after landing in Germany without the necessary papers for the animal. Before that, the 19-year-old singer had a trying stay in London. The star struggled with his breathing and fainted backstage at a show, was taken to a hos-pital and then was caught on camera clashing with a paparazzo. Days earlier, he was booed by his fans when he showed up late 
to a concert.”
Like, we suppose this wasn’t the worst thing he could have 
written in the guest book, but it is completely misguided. Al-
though the lives and times of celebrities have very little meaning or impact on our day-to-day business as a human race, it’s an intriguing look into the thought process of a teenage pop star.
Did he wish she survived the Holocaust, speciﬁ  cally, or did 
he wish she would have been a teenager nowadays in order to be one of his fans? Representatives were asked for a comment or an 
explanation, but they haven’t given any. The world may never 
know. Hopefully, he had good intentions behind the comment, but it shined a light on the intellectual capacity of a pop star and his fans.Un-Belieber-ble: 
Justin Bieber is out of 
touch with reality

Florida Legislature needs to pipe down 
about ridiculous laws
I know as a law student I tend to shut my-
self off from the outside world while it gets 
closer to ﬁ  nals. But I’m very surprised I missed the news that all Florida public universities are top in the nation, our public education gradu-
ation rate is at 100 percent, unemployment is 
nonexistent, and private businesses are boom-ing across the state.
Oh wait, that didn’t happen? I’m sorry. I 
just had to assume so because our Legislature seems to think that the most pressing issue right now is a “bong ban” in tobacco shops.
What is the “bong ban,” you ask? Well, in an effort to supposedly curb illegal drug use, the Florida Legislature has decided to ban the sale of completely legal water tobacco pipes because people can smoke illegal drugs out of 
them. This ban is a great leap backward from 
the previous, equally restrictive measures that heavily regulated the sale of these pipes in Florida shops.
Well, as long as we’re on this race to the 
logical bottom, let’s not stop with just tobacco pipes! Let’s ban any sort of rolled smoking materials. Say goodbye to cigarettes and cigars because people can use those rolling papers for 
other smoking activities. And, for good mea-
sure, we should probably ban two-liter soda bottles because you never know how people are going to use those. Don’t club hoppers put Ecstasy into lollipops nowadays?  Better make that candy illegal! We don’t want kids to get 
the wrong idea.
Does this sound incredibly ridiculous to 
you?
That’s because it is.
It’s ridiculous to pass an incredibly broad 
law that doesn’t actually achieve its underly-ing purpose.
It’s ridiculous to make legitimate products 
illegal because they can be used for illegiti-
mate purposes.
It’s ridiculous that the Florida Legislature is wasting their time and your money pursuing 
fruitless ends.
And it’s ridiculous that they would be do-
ing so on the backs of small businesses.
And if you think this is ridiculous, then 
please, take ﬁ  ve minutes out of your day and visit http://www.myﬂ  oridahouse.gov/sec-tions/representatives/myrepresentative.aspx to ﬁ  nd the phone numbers for your state rep-resentatives. Call them and tell them to vote “no” on these two bills because there’s too much going on in Florida to spend time on the ridiculous.

Letter to the Editor
Basketball season is over and done with, but there’s one 
lingering image I have from it.
It’s not a big-time play, not a ﬁ  ery coach yelling at a 
referee or player. It’s an image that was never shown on Sports-Center or the front page of a paper’s sports section.
The image in my mind comes from one of UF’s home 
games.
I had to sit in the farthest back row of the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center because it was the only seat I could ﬁ  nd. I could barely see the court, so I pulled out my Nintendo 3DS and started playing it when UF jumped out to a large lead.
But despite the game being over halfway through the ﬁ  rst 
half and not entertaining me whatsoever, there was a fan in front of me cheering and chanting and carrying on as if he 
were in the front row. That is the image that stuck with me, 
where someone was so passionate that it didn’t matter what the score was or if the players, coaches and referees could even hear him.
Fast-forward to April 8.It is Monday Night Raw after WWE’s WrestleMania — the 
Super Bowl for wrestling fans. Their Daytona 500, their Stanley Cup ﬁ  nals and so on and so forth. This Raw was a much better event than the WrestleMania from the night before for a single reason: the crowd.
The crowd at Raw was incredible. They chanted all night 
and even sang the entrance song to one superstar when the ac-tual events of the evening became boring.
That song, “ChaChaLaLa,” is just an instrumental. All the 
crowd did was change the pitch of “do”as they kept time with it. Furthermore, there are multiple studies that prove a raucous crowd at a sporting event can change the ﬂ  ow of the game. The changes are not from visiting players underperforming on the road but from refs who are more likely to make the popular call.
All of this comes together to prove a single point: When 
crowds come together, they can completely alter whatever re-ality, be it scripted or otherwise, was in store before the gather-
ing.
I can foresee the response already.
“Well, duh,” you think. “Of course a group of people will 
change more than what a single person will change.” In re-sponse to you, dear (hopefully nonﬁ  ctional) reader, I have but one request.
Gainesville will elect its mayor in a runoff election Tuesday. 
City elections have horrible turnouts, so a good crowd on this day, of all days, will result in one group exerting its will upon the city.
Local elections have much 
more impact on a citizen’s day-to-day life than national elections, yet they get ignored because they lack 
the appeal of a national election.
Everyone and their cousin 
wants to weigh in with their views 
on gay marriage, abortion or gun control, but issues like lane reduc-
tion, biomass and public transportation fall to the wayside.
Every UF student rides buses for free, so there’s one issue 
we should be concerned with. Lane reduction usually gener-ates more trafﬁ  c, which should be on the mind of every UF stu-
dent who lives off campus.
I’ve got nothing regarding biomass. I can’t make that inter-
esting. Regardless, two of three major issues can impact UF stu-
dents, yet there is no buzz on campus whatsoever except from the daily Alligator article that usually ends up on page 3.
Speaking of three, if two’s company and three’s a crowd, I’ll 
take that crowd to their polling location myself if I have to.

Patrons young and old came out 
to the Miles of Smiles fundraiser to 
see Magic and Catherine, the two American miniature horse stars from Gentle Carousel Miniature 
Therapy Horses.
From noon to 2 p.m. Saturday, 
the two horses took pictures with 
about 100 people who attended the fundraising event.
Local dentists Brian Decker and Ann Pomeranz came up with the 
idea to provide free dental proce-
dures and raise money for Gentle Carousel, which will make the trip up to Newtown, Conn., today. Gen-tle Carousel had traveled to New-town before to provide the commu-nity with a therapy outlet after the Sandy Hook tragedy.
Decker has been friends with 
Gentle Carousel’s founder, Jorge Garcia-Bengochea, since their days at Buchholz High School. Decker said they raised about $5,000.“He represents one amazing 
thing about this community,” he said.
The organization, headquartered 
in Alachua County, is a volunteer nonprofit charity that visits about 20,000 adults and children each year inside hospitals, hospice programs and assisted living programs. The team of 22 horses also takes turns 
visiting adults and children with 
disabilities, and at-risk and abused children.
Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, 54, 
helps run Gentle Carousel with her husband. She said she’s excited about the long trip. Along the way, they will make stops at St. Jude Chil-dren’s Research Hospital in Mem-
phis, Tenn., and Vanderbilt Uni-
versity in Nashville, Tenn. On this trip, Magic and Catherine will take the lead in the team of horses, stop-ping every once in a while to rest 
and relax before appearing at public 
events.  
“We want these horses to live a 
natural life,” Debbie Garcia-Ben-gochea said, “but they love what they do.”
Decker and Pomeranz said they 
plan on holding another fundraiser next year for Gentle Carousel.
“You hear the stories they come 
back with, and they bring tears to your eyes instantly,” Pomeranz said.

Revenge porn may soon become illegal if a Florida 
bill makes its way through the House of Representa-
tives. House Bill 787, sponsored by Rep. Tom Good-
son (R-Titusville), passed unanimously through the Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee. If 
passed, the bill could take effect Oct. 1.
The posting of nude pictures of ex-lovers on the 
Internet is a new but increasingly popular phenom-
enon, said Michelle Jacobs, a UF law professor.
The most recent uproar came with the populariza-
tion of the website Is Anybody Down, a well-known 
revenge porn site run by Craig Brittain, Jacobs said.
“The state is trying to get ahead of the curve and 
deal with some of these issues that technology is pro-ducing,” she said.
If passed, this bill could be one of the first in the 
nation to criminalize the act, which has previously been considered a civil matter. The law would make 
posting this material a felony, punishable by fines up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison, Jacobs said.
Current privacy laws in Florida protect against 
cyberstalking, invasion of privacy and purposeful infliction of emotional distress.
The law seeks to fill a gap in the existing laws to 
protect victims of revenge porn, said Lyrissa Lidsky, a UF law professor specializing in free speech online.
“Pornography is protected by the First Amend-
ment,” she said, “but the problem here isn’t that it’s pornographic, it’s that you don’t have the consent of 
the subject of the photo.”
First Amendment rights include the right to intel-
lectual property, which some argue covers the distri-bution of images a person has taken themselves, even 
if they involve others in a sexual manner. However, First Amendment protections don’t cover harming 
others, which is how the state has framed their argu-
ment against revenge porn, Jacobs said.
“If someone is damaged or injured as a result of 
that, you’re liable,” she said. “It doesn’t matter that you thought you were exercising your First Amend-ment rights.”Revenge porn 
could be outlawed

UF’s College of Dentistry is looking 
for volunteers who are willing to serve 
as patients for DMD state board exams.
The college is looking for about 300 
volunteers 20- to 40-years old with cer-
tain cavity or periodontal gum issues. 
They should not have seen a dentist in the last few months, said Richelle Jan-iec, College of Dentistry coordinator for clinical programs.
She said not all pa-
tients scanned will be accepted for the free service. The clinical portion of the exam 
tests the students’ competency to per-
form the skills they’ve 
learned in school, Janiec said.
“Successful completion of the state 
dental board examination leads the 
board candidate to become licensed to practice dentistry in the state of Florida,” she said.UF student Dominique Jonas said she 
wouldn’t participate because she has her own dentist. She said she understands the importance of good dental hygiene.
“You only get one set of teeth, so you 
don’t really want to neglect them or ig-nore it,” the 21-year-old civil engineering junior said.
Some of the procedures that will be 
performed on volunteers are fillings and periodontal scaling, which is deep gum and root surface cleaning in the mouth.
The Florida Board of Dentistry and 
the North East Regional Board of Dental Examiners Inc. will supervise the exam.College of Dentistry needs volunteers

With just a few months until graduation, 
Cody Romano became nostalgic about his 
college experience. The 22-year-old UF public relations senior was inspired to find a way to preserve memories over the years.
Two months later, Romano created an ap-
plication: Geopackages. With Geopackages, a user can create a package and fill it with text and photos at a specific location. The package is virtually dropped at that location. In order 
to access a package, a user must go to the loca-tion to open it. Users can then also add to the 
package.
Geopackages can be accessed for free 
through a cellphone’s browser. The app is in-tegrated with Facebook and Instagram, where 
users can upload photos from their accounts. 
Although the web app won’t be out until Sat-urday, users can now apply to test the app at www.geopackages.com.
“It’s a lot of work, but it’s really fun, and I think it’ll be worth it if it helps people preserve memories from college,” Romano said.
Romano and his girlfriend, 22-year-old UF 
alumna Caitlin Riggs, drop packages at inter-state rest areas when they commute to see each 
other between Gainesville and Tallahassee.
“It’s kinda fun to stop at a rest area you 
don’t usually stop at and keep the story go-
ing,” Riggs said.

The outcome of Florida’s series fi-
nale against South Carolina was not 
in doubt after the Gators exploded for 10 runs in the bottom of the sixth in-ning on Saturday. 
But the game could have been 
closer following the outburst if South 
Carolina had taken advan-tage of mul-tiple earlier 
opportunities.
The eigth-ranked Gamecocks (27-
10, 8-7 Southeastern Conference) 
struggled in key spots at the plate 
before the Gators (19-18, 8-7 SEC) pulled away for a 14-5 victory to com-plete the series sweep at McKethan Stadium.
“It wasn’t a good day,” USC coach 
Chad Holbrook said. “We didn’t play well.”South Carolina loaded the bases 
with one out in the top of the second inning but came away with only one run. Center fielder Tanner English fouled out to third and Florida starter Jay Carmichael walked in a run. Left-
hander Bobby Poyner then replaced 
Carmichael and forced third baseman Chase Vergason to fly out to center.
The Gamecocks left 32 runners 
on base during the series. UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said each of the stranded runners could be attributed to both his pitchers’ command and USC’s approach.
“Against teams like South Caro-
lina, as aggressive as they are, we’re trying to throw first-pitch strikes and jump ahead,” O”Sullivan said. “Those things are going to happen.”

ize in the top of the fourth on Sunday when Graham Saiko doubled down USC inopportune in lossesADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Richie Martin yelled into the Florida dug-
out from second base, unleashing a fury of 
emotion that rivaled his team’s offensive out-burst in the sixth inning. Martin drove in the third and fourth runs of the sixth on a single. 
Florida would add six more in its first 10-run 
inning since plating 11 against Kentucky on April 2, 2005.
Florida (19-18, 8-7 Southeastern Confer-
ence) sent 13 batters to the plate during the in-ning en route to a 14-5 drubbing of No. 8 South Carolina (27-10, 8-7 SEC) Saturday afternoon at McKethan Stadium to complete a series sweep of its conference rival.
“Probably the best offensive day we’ve had 
all year,” Justin Shafer said.
After South Carolina tied the game at four 
in the top half of the inning, Vickash Ramjit started the rally with a double. Harrison Bader walked two batters later to load the bases with no outs for pinch hitter Josh Tobias, who gave Florida its first runs since a four-run second.
Every batter scored at least once. Ramjit 
scored twice following his second double of the game. His leadoff double marked the first extra-base hit for Florida all weekend.
South Carolina used four different pitchers 
in the inning. The Gamecocks didn’t reach a two-strike count until the seventh batter at the plate.
“We were just seeing pitches up and hit-
ting them,” Tobias said. “Attacking early. We didn’t get to two strikes. Just seeing pitches early in the count and putting good swings on them.”Offensive outburst seals sweep of South Carolina

Senior Vickash Ramjit hits the ball during Florida’s 14-5 win against South Carolina on Saturday at McKethan Stadium. 
Ramjit scored three times in the victory, which completed the Gators’ first sweep against the Gamecocks since April 2009.

Taylor Schwarz struggled 
through Florida’s first two 
games against Kentucky. 
The freshman first base-
man went 0 for 6 while strik-ing out four times on Friday and Saturday. 
But Schwarz was locked in 
at the plate on Sunday.
Schwarz went 3 for 3 with 
a home run and a triple in No. 3 Florida’s (41-5, 14-4 South-
eastern Conference) 6-3 win 
against No. 18 Kentucky (31-12, 9-6 SEC).
The win clinched the 
Gators’ sixth straight SEC se-ries.
“It felt really good,” Schwarz said.
“I definitely have to give 
credit to Coach (Tim) Walton, because he kept me up after those two days. Hitting is a 
confidence struggle in 
this game, so he just kind of told me, ‘Don’t 
get down on 
yourself.’”
Walton’s 
words proved helpful for Schwarz. 
She broke a 1-1 tie in the 
top of the second inning with a leadoff homer that gave the Gators a lead they would nev-
er relinquish.
Schwarz came up big again in the third when she singled 
to left field, scoring two more 
runs to give Florida a 5-1 lead, 
tied for the biggest advantage the Gators had in the series.
Schwarz added a triple to 
start the sixth inning, but did 
not get a chance to hit for the 
cycle.
Sophomore Bailey Castro 
flew out to end Florida’s half 
of the seventh, two batters 
away from Schwarz in the seven-hole.
“I was hoping a little bit,” 
Schwarz said of getting anoth-
er at-bat in pursuit of a cycle.
“But after that, I was like, 
‘OK, let’s win this.’”
Schwarz had a chance to 
drive in three runs because Freshman first baseman breaks

Florida’s Ashley Bruns (13) attacks the net against Ohio State defender Tayler Kuzma (24) in 
the Gators’ 13-7 win against the Buckeyes on March 23 at Dizney Stadium.MAX MATTERN
Alligator Writer
 
Ashley Bruns was unstoppable on 
Sunday. 
Bruns tied a career-high scor-
ing mark with eight goals to help 
Florida (15-1, 3-1 American Lacrosse 
Conference) overcome a slow start 
and overmatch Vanderbilt (2-13, 0-5 ALC) 21-10.
Her eight goals also equaled a pro-
gram record.
Midway through the first half, 
the fourth-ranked Gators trailed the Commodores 5-4.
Coach Amanda O’Leary took a 
timeout to calm her team.
“It was a matter of playing the 
type of game that we needed to play,” O’Leary. “We just needed to right the 
ship defensively.”
The Gators responded with a 7-3 
run to end the first half.
Florida maintained its momentum after halftime, using a five-goal run 
in 9 minutes to derail any chance of a comeback from the Commodores.
Florida outscored Vandy 10-2 in 
the second half.
Bruns provided a spark through-
out the game. Eight of her nine shots from the crease found the back of the net.
“Eight for nine? That’s a legend-
ary game right there,” O’Leary said. “She was doing it all today. She just 
had a monstrous game.”
Bruns has 13 goals in her past two 
games.
“It feels really great scoring that 
many goals today,” Bruns said. 
UF unleashed a season-high 40 
shots in the game, notching the 
fourth-highest mark in program his-tory. Despite shooting better than 50 
percent, the Gators were stymied by 
Vanderbilt goalkeeper Chelsea Pas-field, who stopped 14 shots.
“We were coming in on her one-
on-one, and she was making point-blank saves,” O’Leary said. “Defi-nitely hats off to their goalkeeper because she was keeping them in the game.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 15, 2013
Senior attacker enjoys historic day in UF lacrosse team’s winMICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer
 
Four years, four Southeastern 
Conference championships for Lau-
ren Embree and Caroline Hitimana.
Florida clinched a share of the 
2013 SEC title with a closely con-
tested 4-1 win against Vanderbilt on 
Sunday in Nashville, Tenn.
“I’m really happy for Caroline 
and Lauren to win four straight SEC Championships,” coach Ro-land Thornqvist said in a release. “It’s something we can’t take for granted. We’ve been blessed to have won quite a few here but we must always keep in mind how difficult it is to win in this league.”
Sofie Oyen was stuck in a first-set 
slump in singles play on Sunday.
After winning three games, Van-
derbilt’s Courtney Colton took con-trol of the court to end the set 6-3. Oyen shaped up in the second.
The junior from Belgium 
matched Colton’s first-set effort and won 6-3 to force a third set.
With UF leading 3-1, Oyen 
turned her second-set momentum into a 6-4 win in 
the third, sealing Florida’s victory.
Junior Olivia 
Janowicz played a close first set 
against Ashleigh 
Antal, eventu-ally edging Antal out in two games 
for a 7-5 win. Janowicz came out tougher in the second and quickly grabbed a 6-1 win to put the Gators on the scoreboard.
Alex Cercone and Embree fol-lowed suit, grabbing two more sin-gles wins for Florida.
Cercone took out Georgina 
Sellyn 6-1 in the first and 6-3 in the second.
After trailing by two games in 
the first, Embree overcame Lauren Mira’s lead to win 6-2. The top-ranked senior played quickly in the second set, taking down Mira 6-1. 
Embree’s competitive singles 
play didn’t match up in doubles.
The Commodores sealed their 
victory in doubles after Embree and Oyen lost to Colton and Mira 8-4. For the first time in five matches, the No. 17 Florida pairing has dropped a doubles match. 
Danielle Collins and Morgan lost 
8-5 to Frances Altick and Georgina Sellyn. 
“Vanderbilt played really well 
in doubles. It was really windy and they utilized the wind really well,” Thornqvist said. “We struggled a little with our decision making in the win but once singles started we got off to a fast start.”
The Gators begin play in the SEC 
Championships on Friday.

the top of the order managed to 
get on base often.
The first four batters in Flori-
da’s lineup got on seven times in 
16 plate appearances.
They drove in three of the 
Gators’ six runs in the rubber 
game.
Freshman second baseman 
Kelsey Stewart picked up where 
she left off against USF on Wednes-day, going 6 for 11 at the plate 
against the Wildcats and scoring 
four runs.
Stewart put Florida on the 
board early on Sunday.
She hit a single to lead off the 
game, stole second and scored on a single by sophomore Lauren Hae-ger. The Gators scored the first run in all three games of the series.
“If we score in the first inning, 
you know it’s going to be a good game,” Stewart said. 
Florida needed the early cush-
ion against Kentucky.Although UF scored first in each 
game, UK came back to within at least one run in all three games.
Florida’s pitchers struggled to 
keep Kentucky hitters off the base paths all weekend, with mixed re-sults.
Junior Hannah Rogers started 
for Florida on Sunday, and she struggled for her third straight outing.
After giving up three earned 
runs in a complete-game win on 
Friday, the right-hander gave up 
another three in three innings in the rubber game.
Sophomore Alyssa Bache re-
lieved Rogers in the fourth and pitched 2.1 scoreless innings to earn the victory.
Haeger pitched the final 1.2 in-
nings, notching her second save of 
the season after picking up the loss 
on Saturday.
“It was really a good mix of ev-
erybody,” Haeger said.
“I think that’s why we were 
successful.”

Junior pitcher Daniel Gibson winds up for a pitch during Florida’s 14-5 win against South Carolina on Saturday at McKethan 
Stadium. The southpaw earned the victory on Saturday, striking out on in 1.2 scoreless innings of relief,
Gamecocks stranded 32 runners against Gators
While the Gators earned their first sweep 
against the Gamecocks since April 2009, there 
wasn’t time to celebrate. Florida turned its fo-cus in the dugout to a road matchup on Tues-day night against Florida Gulf Coast.
“We have had a lot of downs,” Ramjit said. 
“It feels our work is paying off. Everything is starting to turn for the better.”
Shafer acts as bridge: Freshman right-hander 
Jay Carmichael returned to the mound for his first start since March 29 against Mississippi. He lasted 1.2 innings and never established his fastball to compliment his curveball.
Carmichael walked in a run for his last 
batter of the game in the second. Florida re-sponded with four runs on five hits in the bottom half of that inning off South Carolina right-hander Colby Holmes, who lasted only 1.2 innings in his start as well.
Luckily for Florida, Shafer allowed one 
earned run in three innings of relief. He threw 1.2 innings in relief during a 4-3 win against 
FSU on Tuesday in Tallahassee. He started 
both games as the designated hitter.
Shafer entered in the third after left-hand-
er Bobby Poyner gave up a two-run homer to left-handed batter Max Schrock. 
Although left-hander Daniel Gibson 
earned the victory, Shafer kept the Game-cocks at bay until he turned it over to Gibson in the sixth. 
“He did a nice job at Florida State and he 
did a nice job today,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said. “It’s nice to have a guy that throws 
strikes that you know is going to settle things 
down.”

son followed him with a groundout to 
the pitcher, Justin Shafer. O’Sullivan then 
decided to intentionally walk the Game-cocks’ home run leader, first baseman LB Dantzler, to get to their batting average leader, Brison Celek. The move paid off as Celek fouled out to first to end the threat.
USC squandered an opportunity to 
take the lead in the top of the sixth — just prior to Florida’s 10-run frame. 
The Gamecocks loaded the bases with 
one out thanks to singles from shortstop 
Joey Pankake and Vergason and a walk by 
Saiko. UF reliever Daniel Gibson forced Dantzler to ground into a fielder’s choice, which plated USC’s only run in the in-ning. Gibson then got out of the inning as second baseman Max Schrock flew out to left.
Florida pitchers retired batters with one 
or two pitches seven times on Sunday, but South Carolina hitters also got four hits in at-bats of the same length. Holbrook said he was fine with his players showing ag-
gression, but they have to maintain good 
plate discipline. 
“You got to get good pitches to hit ear-
ly in the count,” Holbrook said.
“We try to teach them, if you’re going 
to swing early, make sure it’s a good pitch. Sometimes that’s the best pitch you get.”

THE RALLY
  Joe: Florida desperately needs a playmak-
er in the passing game.
  The Gators posted a record of 11-2 
and earned a Sugar Bowl berth despite ﬁ  n-ishing last in the Southeastern Conference 
with 146.3 passing yards per game in 2012.
  Imagine what a solid passing game 
would have meant for coach Will Mus-
champ’s team, which fell one win short of the SEC Championship Game last year.
  While quarterback Jeff Driskel struggled 
with ﬁ  eld vision and decision-making dur-ing his ﬁ  rst season as Florida’s starting quarterback, I buy into the cliche that says, 
“A craftsman is only as good as his tools.”
  The Gators’ receiving corps left much 
to be desired in 2012. The returners from 
last season’s group inspire even less conﬁ  -dence.
  Florida’s returning wideouts combined 
for 44 catches, 426 yards and four touch-downs last year. They need a breakout guy, and it’s not Quinton Dunbar.
  If the Gators’ passing game gets any-
where in 2013, the emergence of incoming four-star stud Demarcus Robinson will be the reason why.
    Phil: While I will admit the passing game 
is missing some screws, there is a more pressing question facing the Gators’ offense: Can it replace Mike Gillislee? Behind him, 
Florida ﬁ  nished third in the SEC with 187.7 
rushing yards per game last season and consistently took opposing defenses to the woodshed by utilizing heavy fronts late in games. Just ask LSU how that felt. 
  But Gillislee is gone. Although sopho-
more tailback Matt Jones received praise from Muschamp throughout the spring, he is a guy that carried the ball only 52 times as 
a freshman. 
  It remains to be seen whether Jones will 
be effective when facing SEC defenses on a weekly basis. Also, 
injury concerns arise when a tailback is asked to carry a much heavier load 
than in the previous 
season. 
  That’s where Kel-
vin Taylor comes in. The heralded four-star product out of Belle Glade will make an immediate impact in the backﬁ  eld and could push Jones for ﬁ  rst-team reps before all is said and done.
    Joe: Gillislee had only 56 carries in 2011 
before assuming the starting running back role last year. Look how he turned out.
  Never mind that Gillislee averaged just 
48.3 carries per season in his ﬁ  rst three years as a Gator. Gilly is a talented back who ﬂ  ourished with an increased workload and an offense that highlighted his strengths.
  I believe Jones will deliver similar results 
this season. And when Jones needs a break or UF needs a change of pace, Kelvin Taylor, Adam Lane and Mack Brown will be wait-ing in the wings to contribute.
  But if Demarcus Robinson has an off day 
or cannot deliver at wide receiver, where will Driskel look?
  Big target Jordan Reed is gone. That’s a 
devastating blow to this offense.
  Dunbar had a great spring, coaches say. 
But when has the underperforming wideout ever not delivered in April? Let’s see it in October.
  Loucheiz Purifoy is an option, but if you 
think Muschamp — a former defensive back — is going to let his best tackler in the sec-ondary just switch to the offensive side of 
the ball permanently, you’re insane.
  Kelvin Taylor is a very talented player at 
a crowded position. Robinson is also a very talented player but at 
a position with des-perate needs.
  Robinson will 
have the larger im-
pact.
  
  Phil: Remember 
when Latroy Pittman was the talk of the off-
season this time a year ago? Like Robinson, Pittman was a four-star prospect who early enrolled at Florida and began impressing from the moment he walked on campus.
  Then he caught two passes for 6 yards the 
entire season while battling an ankle injury.
  Granted, Robinson is a better talent than 
Pittman.
I will admit that.But, as Muschamp has said, it is very dif-
ﬁ  cult to have an instant impact as a freshman receiver. How are you so sure Robinson will be any different than the other big names 
who have ﬂ  amed out in their ﬁ  rst year?
  Adding to the degree of difﬁ  culty is the 
fact that Robinson has already suffered an 
ankle injury of his own that limited him throughout spring practice.
  It would not be completely surprising to 
see him with numbers only marginally bet-ter than Pittman’s, especially if he is both-ered by nagging injuries throughout the 
season.
  Speaking of catching the ball, Taylor will 
separate himself in a crowded backﬁ  eld 
with his ability to augment Florida’s pass-ing attack.
  I know you remember watching him 
scamper for a 40-yard receiving touchdown during a scrimmage in March. He has supe-rior hands and instincts in the open ﬁ  eld.
  For as great as Gillislee was, he only had 
one receiving touchdown last season. That was not the strength of his game. But as a dual threat, Taylor will have an impact in the rushing and receiving game.
    Joe: I’m going to take a page out of Mus-
champ’s book.
  “Let’s let Kelvin be Kelvin, and Fred’s 
Fred,” Muschamp said on April 6.
  Let Latroy be Latroy, and Demarcus is 
Demarcus.
  Granted, Robinson could easily become 
lost in the fray, suffer an injury and become a mostly ineffective member of Florida’s re-ceiving corps. But don’t count on it.
  Robinson is a playmaker. Matched up 
head-to-head against Purifoy and Marcus Roberson during the spring “game,” Robin-son held tough and made difﬁ  cult catches against two premium SEC corners.
  Regardless of how much or how little 
success Taylor enjoys this season, Florida will be ﬁ  ne at running back.
  But the Gators desperately need a wide 
receiver to step up this season, and Robin-
son is that guy.
  
  Phil: You’re right. Robinson was im-
pressive against Roberson and Purifoy, and that’s a good start. That said, he better get used to making plays against elite SEC cor-ners.
  With the rest of the receiving corps noth-
ing more than a ragtag bunch at this point, 
Robinson will be covered with the best de-
fensive backs opposing defenses have to offer. He is going to have to work hard for everything he gets.
  The depth at running back will keep 
Taylor fresh, and he will quickly carve out a niche because of it. 
  Robinson isn’t at fault, but he won’t 
match that production.
