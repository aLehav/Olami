BLOOMINGTON, Ill. — A 16-year-old 
central Illinois girl has been given $150 
in tickets after the worried victims of her April Fool’s Day prank called police.
Bloomington police say the girl texted 
her friend and cousin Friday morning and said she’d been robbed and shot in the foot.
The pair called police, who rushed to 
a home where they found the 16-year-old safe. She hadn’t been robbed or shot.The (Bloomington) Pantagraph reports 
the girl received a $100 ticket for disorderly conduct and a $50 ticket for truancy be-cause she wasn’t in school Friday.
Police say she could have been criminal-
ly charged with filing a false police report.
Bloomington police spokesman Dave 
White says the friend and cousin did the right thing by calling police. They haven’t been cited or charged.

As the opening lines of Reel 2 
Real’s “I Like  to Move It” echoed 
through the O’Connell Center on Saturday, a mob of about 800 stu-dents rushed to the center of the 
floor.
Then, they danced. 
This is Dance Marathon, a tradi-
tion that celebrated its 17th year at UF last weekend. 
Students started standing at 
11:48 a.m. Saturday and didn’t sit down again until about 2 p.m. Sun-day. 
Students stood for 26.2 hours to 
raise money for the Children’s Mir -
acle Network at Shands Children’s Hospital at UF, said Kenny Brigh-ton, a graduate student who served as the overall director for DM.
Last year, the dancers broke 
their record by raising more than $500,000. This year, DM raised 
$713,053.68.
Students raised money through-
out the year for the organization, 
which culminated in the all-night dance-a-thon.

As he laid his Bible and handgun ever so 
carefully down on a music stand, Terry Jones 
slowly made his way to the pulpit to deliver 
his sermon.
For all the sweeping vows and charged 
rhetoric he has delivered  in the past several 
months, Jones, the pastor of the Dove World 
Outreach Center,  let his hands do most of the 
talking Sunday. 
They pounded with every rising cadence, 
pointed outward to the enemies beyond the church’s walls and drew inward to call upon 
those gathered to stand up for “the truth.” 
It’s these hands, most people say , that 
are responsible for the the blood spilled in 
Afghanistan as at least 21 people have been 
killed in the last three days in reaction to the 
church’s  burning of the Quran, which took 
place March 20 under Jones’ direction. 
But that’s for the outside world. On this 
Sunday , Jones is leading his flock through the 
Book of Joshua and how the Israelities crossed 
the Jordan River while carrying the covenant. 
The river was wet, dirty and muddy, Jones 
tells his followers. There may have been bugs and mosquitoes there to nibble on flesh. 
This was not a time for democracy or votes. 
In order for Joshua’s people to survive, Jones says, they needed to obey.
“It took many strong men to carry the 
covenant,” he says. “ It was not easy, but you know what it was? It was a privilege and an 
honor.”
Now, the time has come, Jones tells his 
audience, for the church to carry its covenant. 
Like Martin Luther King Jr., the founding fa-
thers in the American Revolution and the first 
Christians, they must be 
willing to take a chance.
“When the Civil Rights Movement first 
happened, many people died. Does that make [King] wrong?” Jones asks the crowds.
“NO!” the worshipers answer in reply .  Later, Jones tells them, “ Why do I do what I do? I do simply what I do because I’m more afraid of God than I am of you.” 
That fear, Jones says, cannot be overpow-
ered by any threats of violence against him or 
his church. 
“There’s only one way to stop me,” Jones 
says. 
“Kill me.”

Fake massage parlor 
inspector pleads not guilty
NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. 
— A former police officer has 
pleaded not guilty to show-
ing up at a Southern California 
massage parlor wearing a badge and a gun and demanding a free rubdown and cash for his 
“inspection” of the business.
Edward Justin LaPorte — 
who is accused of posing as an 
inspector — got a 30-minute backrub, police say. He is ac-
cused of then requesting a fron-
tal massage and $200.
The manager of the Golden 
Spa was suspicious about the 
supposed quality-control check 
and called Lake Forest licensing offices.
LaPorte, 47, left when a real 
inspector arrived and started 
asking questions, police say. 
LaPorte then allegedly fled and was tracked down by his license plate number.

Wyoming town’s four 
residents counted after Census snafu
LOST SPRINGS, Wyo. — 
The Wyoming town of Lost 
Springs can finally count on 
the Census to get its popula-
tion correct: Four, not one.
The Casper Star-Tribune re-
ports that the Census Bureau somehow missed four other residents of the town when it 
counted only one person in 
2000.
The cause of that mistake 
wasn’t clear. Leda Price, who 
lives on the west side of the 
1-block Main Street, jokes that officials must have counted only her side of town.
The 2010 Census, however, 
got it right this time when it found and counted all four of Lost Springs’ residents. The newspaper reports that since PARTLY

V oices from around the state filled the 
University Auditorium on Sunday eve-
ning for the University Gospel Choir’s annual spring Gospel Extravaganza. 
This year’s event, which drew about 
320 people, was titled “The Garden of Praise.” The event featured choirs from UF, the University of South Florida and the University of Central Florida, as well as guest artist 13th Disciple. 
The concert opened with a solo danc-
er and was followed by the stomping 
and clapping UF choir.  
By the end of the first 
song, half of those in the audience were on their 
feet, clapping to the rhythm. 
“Tonight we want to transform this 
auditorium into a sanctuary,”  said pas-tor Natron A. Curtis of the Mt. Zura Full 
Gospel Baptist Church in Newberry . 
The concert ended with an a cappella 
performance by 13th Disciple. 
Dianeka Perrien, a sophomore crimi-
nology major, said she attended the con-
cert to hear live gospel music and sup-port a friend in the choir. 
“You don’t find gospel music around 
here a lot in Gainesville — in college in 
general,” she said.
April 7, 1979: About 5,000 people, ranging 
in age from 16 months old to 72 years old, gather at Lake Alice Field and smoke out in public as part of a “toke-in” benefit concert supporting the legalization of marijuana. A Tallahassee-based lobbying group collects 2,280 signatures in support of a bill propos-ing that posession of one ounce of marijuana  be a violation, as opposed to the existing law, which makes posession of five grams a mis-demeanor. 
April 3, 1983: Officials and boosters of the UF 
football program violated NCAA rules for encouraging student athletes to make money in strictly prohibited ways. The St. Petersburg Times conducts its own investigation and re-ports that players made thousands selling their season tickets, often above face value, and spent their summers selling advertising space to boosters. 
April 9, 1994: Local police collect 22 guns in 
exchange for food baskets, gift certificates and sports apparel during their “Gifts for Guns” program. “If we get one gun out of cir -
culation then this project is worthwhile,” said Ryan Alderman, administrative assistant for UF’s Interfraternity Council.

The University Gospel Choir, headed by PASSAGE Family Church member Nate McCray, sang and danced for a crowd of about 320 Sunday night in the University Auditorium.

OnCampu swhite images of a World War II documen-

Then Lowe called. His Friday, Lowe told Garner, had just got-
ten a lot worse.
Immediately, Garner flipped open his 
computer and went to Google News to find out what all the commotion was about. 
Then, he saw it: “Afghanistan … Koran 
burning … Gainesville church … people 
dead.”
No more day off.
Within minutes, Garner was at City Hall 
working with the mayor and communications 
manager Bob Woods on a response. 
Although an upbeat person by nature, 
Lowe was irritated by the news. The “Dove 
problem” was nothing new for Lowe. These 
were the people who held his city hostage to 
the national spotlight in September. These 
were also the people who had put out a video 
online that called for “no homo mayor” when 
he was running for office last year. 
For Lowe, these people were more than a 
nuisance. They were an embarrassment to his city. Later that afternoon, Lowe addressed the 
media.
“The world we live in is a volatile place,” 
Lowe said. “While there is absolutely no jus-tification for these horrific deaths and inju-
ries, Terry Jones and his followers were quite aware that his actions could trigger these 
types of events.”
While police stepped up their presence 
around the church, Lowe assured those in at-tendance there was no need to panic. 
But would the mayor reach out to the pas-
tor? If he felt it would lead somewhere, Lowe said, then he would.
For the mayor, Terry Jones is a lost cause. n n n
Ismail ibn Ali knew the questions would 
be coming once he turned on his television.
Ibn Ali, the president of Islam on Campus 
at UF,  had heard all the arguments against his 
faith, which holds more than a billion follow-ers worldwide. 
He knew the violence in Afghanistan 
would lead to the same criticism.
But it still hurts.“To have this behavior in Afghanistan is really sad because this is the reaction Terry Jones wanted,” ibn Ali said. “It’s just a really 
sad situation.”
Despite the publicity the city has drawn 
from the events in Afghanistan, ibn Ali said 
Gainesville is still a good town to be a Muslim 
in, even if one church wants to tell the world 
otherwise.
“I could take any creed, twist it and give 
you a reason to do something bad,” he said. 
“This act of violence [in Afghanistan] is not 
something any Muslim would say is justi-fied.”
Although ibn Ali wouldn’t say what hap-
pened in Afghanistan was all Jones’ fault, he said the pastor carries some responsibility. 
Then again, he said, these are people who 
have nothing to lose. 
But, for now, he prays.“I just hope that everyone keeps cool-
headed,” ibn Ali said, “and that wisdom pre-vails.”
n n n
Wayne Sapp knew what was coming when 
he put the flame to the book. The gun on his 
waist testifies to the lingering thought that 
someone, somewhere wants him dead.  
He said he feels sympathy for the victims 
and their families. 
He asserted he never would harm a Mus-
lim, let alone kill one. But God’s work, he said, needed to be done.
“It’s like a snake being in a bed with a 
bunch of babies,” said Sapp, Jones’ second-in-command. “Do you just let it continue to 
creep and let it breed, or do you reach in and 
get it?”
Reaching in, however, comes at a price.“We’re human beings. Of course we have 
moments of fear,” said Luke Jones, the senior pastor’s son and a pastor at the church. “When 
the world comes raining down on you, you 
feel the emotion.” 
That doesn’t mean the church has any 
plans to stop preaching its controversial mes-sage anytime soon.
As Sapp unfastened his tie after Sunday’s 
service, one thing was clear: if he could, he’d 
do it again.
“We’re not in this for the fireworks; we’re 
not in this for the show,” the younger Jones 
said. “We’re not going away.”4, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2011

Afghan protestors beat a burning effigy of President Obama during a demonstration

Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe says there is no need for residents to panic
AFGHANISTAN , from page 1UF offensive coordinator Charlie Weis was among guest speakers
urday to celebrate the grand total 
of 232.8 hours he spent on his feet 
throughout his DM career. 
“In a few hours, I’ll be tired and 
sore,” he said  Saturday afternoon. “Then, you hear about kids who’ve had seizures their whole lives. ... There’s no comparison.”
The best feeling every year is the 
big revelation of how much money the event raised, he said. When 
they broke the $500,000 mark last 
year, the crowd went wild. 
“That’s when you realize why 
you did it,” Michel said. “You raised half a million dollars for Shands.”
While DM used to last for 32 
hours, it was changed a few years ago to make it more manageable for both the participating students and the professors who expected to see them in class Monday morning, 
Brighton said. 
The event isn’t just about danc-
ing, though. Michel characterizes it 
as more of a stand-a-thon. 
People spend a lot of time wan-
dering around the arena talking with friends, but inevitably they’ll 
hear a song they can’t help but 
dance along to. 
DM is run by a staff of students 
who prepare all year to raise mon-ey and plan a fun weekend for the participants. 
The event included theme hours 
where the music, food and activi-ties revolved around a specific idea, Brighton said. This year, ‘Dynamic Duo’ hour and ‘Bro’ hour were among the selected themes.
The staff also planned a rave for Saturday night, complete with la-ser lights and a DJ. 
But the fundraising doesn’t stop 
when the dancers first stand up.
A makeshift jail cell was set up 
in the arena where prominent par -
ticipants, such as Student Govern-
ment members, were placed dur -
ing the marathon. 
Each person set his or her own 
bail, and they couldn’t leave until 
they raised the money by calling 
and emailing potential donors. 
Student Body President Ashton 
Charles raised $500 in 2010, and the 
staffers expected similar success from the DM prisoners this year. 
Speakers like Gator football of-fensive coordinator Charlie Weis also came to cheer on the students as they stood without giving in to the urge to sit down, even if only for a moment. 
The best speakers, however, 
weren’t Gators athletes or coaches, 
they were the children from Shands 
who came with their families to see the dancers  — the children living 
with cancer and other health prob-
lems who DM participants aim to 
help each year. 
Sometimes veteran dancers rec-
ognize children from past mara-
thons. 
“We literally see these kids grow 
up, year after year,” Brighton said.

It might be racist. It might be heritage. Ei-
ther way, no one seems to mind why or how 
Judy Byer gets her shipments of Ku Klux Klan shirts.
She’s been selling them on the road for 20 
years, the past 10 of which were under the red-and-white tent in the back 40 of the Wal-do Flea Market. The sign on the front reads “Redneck Country.”
Under the air-conditioned tent, it’s hard to 
open your eyes without seeing the Confeder -
ate flag. That’s where she makes her money.
License plates, pocket knives, lighters, 
handkerchiefs and bikinis, all emblazoned 
with the stars and bars of Dixie, top the aisles 
of collapsible Formica tables. A glass case to-ward the front holds a collection of Confed-erate flag patches and Obama urinal targets.
Byer said she got the idea to sell her goods 
to prove a point. In 1992, Georgia Gov. Zell Miller introduced legislation to wipe the Confederate battle sign off his state flag, which had flown since 1956.
“He was raising so much Cain about the 
Southern flag — that it’s racist when it’s re-ally heritage,” Byer said.
The flag changed in 2003, but her crusade 
for Southern heritage hasn’t stopped.
She said she doesn’t order the Klan shirts 
out of hate but rather for money. After a request from two men in Ohio, she carried “Black Power” T-shirts. She’s sold Martin 
Luther King Jr. belt buckles, too.
As for the KKK’s message, she said she 
doesn’t agree with “most of their stuff.”
“Everybody’s got their right to feel or buy 
whatever they want,” she said. “I don’t think I’ve got the right to push my opinion on any-
one myself.”
She said her clientele is just as diverse as 
any. She’s sold KKK shirts to people ranging from 7 years old to 95 years old, to whites who wear them fishing and to a black body-builder in Jacksonville who flies the Dixie 
flag in his front yard. She’s seen members of 
the community wearing them in the Waldo Winn-Dixie.
One of the more popular of the 10 shirt 
designs pictures three Klansmen in their white hoods and sheets. Underneath, the shirt reads, “The original boys in the hood.”
About a football field away from the Reb-
el Country tent, 71-year-old Ellcano Reeves sells mustard greens, collards and turnips out of the back of his beat-up, forest-green 1996 Ford F-150.
Growing up in Rayford, Fla., in the 1940s 
and 1950s, he’s seen the worst racism has to offer.
As a 10-year-old, he remembers being  
mugged by the neighborhood white children on his way to the store. He learned to carry 
with him a broom handle wrapped in wire 
on one end when he walked to the store. He would lean the broom handle against the wall of the nearby feed store on his way. 
When the other children would chase him, 
he’d sprint to the broom handle and start busting heads.
In the 1960s, during the Civil Rights 
Movement, he started carrying a knife for 
the same reason.
Even now, a .30-06 rifle rests across the 
bench seat of his pick-up truck. Usually, it’s 
for hunting deer, but he said he wouldn’t 
hesitate to use it for protection.
“I carried it for a purpose,” he said. “But 
don’t change that purpose on me.”
On weekends, he sits in the cool shade 
of the flea market pavilion, propped on the back two legs of a lawn chair. His dusty work 
boots rest on a wooden tabletop while he peddles his produce to shoppers who come down the long aisle.
He said he knows about Rebel Country 
and Judy Byer’s KKK shirts. He said he’s not offended.
“That’s their business,” he said. “I am who 
I am, and I don’t have to change for anybody. 
They are who they are, and they don’t have 
to change for me.”
Still, he said, he wouldn’t go out of his 
way to talk with someone wearing one of the 
shirts because “our views would be so differ -
ent that we couldn’t carry a conversation.”
Flea Market owner Sally Blakewood said 
she welcomes the sellers’ views and their 
products “as long as they stay in their tent 
and don’t bother anybody.”
“We’re pretty big on diversity,” she said. 
“That’s what the flea market’s all about.”MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

70 TOTAL VOTESLet us apologize for going back on our word.
You may remember an editorial from mid-Janu-
ary in which we discussed our organization’s choice 
to ignore the Dove World Outreach Center’s event planned 
for March. 
The lack of coverage from our newspaper and many 
other media organizations did nothing to dissuade pastor 
Terry Jones from his purposefully inflammatory actions. 
As such, today we bring you news coverage not in an-
ticipation of an event meant to incite anger and hatred but 
in anticipation of its aftermath.
No one can say the center’s “trial” of the Quran di-
rectly caused the deaths of U.N. workers halfway around the world — their murders came at the hands of Afghani extremists — but we can say the pastor needlessly poured gasoline on an already blazing fire. 
Speaking of which, we may indeed be stoking the 
flames by even giving the event’s repercussions cover -
age, but sometimes we need a reminder that our actions, even in a small, swampy Florida city, carry consequences around the world. 
Could Jones and his trial have effected such a large 
reaction without the media passing on the message? No, but in this ever-connected world, finding even one sympa-thetic ear to bend allows an extremist access to his enemies 
across the globe.
We have a problem with both the sender and the carri-
ers of this message, but what about the recipients? 
The idea of countering a reprehensible action with an-
other, more vile act — in this case, numerous murders — is terrible. 
Vengeance gets us nowhere, especially when exacted 
upon people who had nothing to do with the original of-
fense. 
No side is in the right here. The best outcome we can 
hope for is that the world will use this as a learning expe-rience. 
People may think they solely are attacking and offend-
ing their opponents, but it is just as likely their words or 
weapons will end up wounding innocents. That is some-
thing we can’t stand for.
It makes us squirm to think we share a city with a man 
who says he’s “saddened” by the deaths in Afghanistan 
but that he’d still hold his trial again if given the chance. 
The pastor should remember that just because our nation’s laws permit us to say or do something doesn’t mean we should, at least from an ethical standpoint. 
We were hoping never to mention the names of the cen-
ter and its leader again, but given the circumstances we must, if only to state for the world that our city and our people don’t stand for the same ideals Terry Jones and his dwindling flock do. 
Apparently, the pastor has noticed this lack of support 
and is trying to move his church elsewhere, where the resi-dents are more sympathetic to his cause. 
We’re hoping he comes up empty on places that wel-
come his provocative attitude. 
Who knows? Maybe our nation can stop one side of this 
argument between extremists from contributing to sense-less violence.Gag Order

American exceptionalism exceptional
Over the past few weeks, the concept of “American 
exceptionalism” has dominated the airwaves. 
With crises brewing both at home and abroad, 
Americans have been forced to confront many press-ing priorities and to re-evaluate their country’s role as a world leader. 
In short, Americans must decide just how ex-
ceptional their exceptionalism is and, more impor -
tantly, how this exceptionalism should manifest it-self to the millions who look toward it as a guiding beacon of hope in an often dark and hopeless world.  
In this debate, two schools of thought have emerged, 
which some claim appear to pit Spider-Man against 
Alexis de Tocqueville. 
The former school of thought views America’s mili-
tary might as exceptional and refers to the fact that “with 
great power comes great responsibility,” while the latter 
school takes the view that America’s self-reliance and re-
sultant prosperity is what makes it exceptional.
Both are true. Rather than being mutually exclusive, they are inter -
dependent. Without prosperity, America would not have the resources to fund its military, and without its mili-tary, America would not be able to protect its prosperity or anyone else. 
This is self-evident.Unfortunately, many on the left fail to see this. They 
focus solely on America’s larger role in the world while ignoring the underlying source of its strength. America is a world leader today and will continue to be so only if all recognize America’s strength is drawn from all Ameri-cans.
The opportunity afforded to individuals for a better 
life is what makes America unique. Despite no guaran-tees of success, this opportunity has drawn millions of immigrants from foreign nations to American shores. This same opportunity is afforded to all native-born Americans as well. In no other country could the son of a foreign father, whom soci-ety should have discounted based on his familial and economic status, 
rise to become leader of the free world. 
America’s obligation is not to cure the ills that ail ev-
eryone but rather to ensure this same opportunity for 
success remains available for future generations. This is 
best accomplished by removing government barriers to individual success and allowing relatively unfettered ac-cess to the free market. 
The globe’s greatest minds have come for ac-
cess to that market, which has resulted in the globe’s greatest inventions and successes.  
America is the most exceptional nation in human his-tory. 
Though we have had problems along the way, Ameri-
ca still is a beacon to a world looking for light. 
The hope of a better life and chance to succeed through 
hard work is exceptional and a concept known only spar -
ingly throughout history and other parts of the world. 
While America may intervene in the affairs of others, 
this is not its lasting legacy. Individual opportunity and freedom from government interference will be. 
American exceptionalism is exceptional, and it will 
continue to be so as long as America recognizes where its true strength lies.

Both sides should seek forgiveness for murders 
This letter is in response to the articles covering the 
deadly protest in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, which ap-
pear to be a result of the antics of  the Dove World Out-
reach Center’s Terry Jones.
Mr. Jones, when did God die and leave you in charge? 
The name of your self-proclaimed religious organization 
is now the poster child for hypocrisy. 
How about changing the name to Hawk World Out-
reach Center, because that is exactly what you intended — to aggravate a group of people who already are seething with anger at their oppression. You, sir, are what is wrong with religion today. What would Jesus do? Or didn’t you 
even consider how Christianity came about?
As for the murderers in Mazar-i-Sharif, how dare you 
take it upon yourselves to defend your “sacred” religious 
beliefs by killing innocent people who meant you no harm 
and were there voluntarily. Perhaps it was the Christian 
belief in charity that motivated them to serve. Now, you have taken them away from us and discouraged others from serving the needs of the Afghan people in spite of the differences in faith. What would Muhammad do? Or 
didn’t you even consider this as well?
Inciting hate, and the reactionary killing, must stop be-
fore it is too late and the world descends into more cha-
os and confusion. Both Jones and the murderers need to 
request some sort of forgiveness by extending whatever 
they can to the families of the survivors. 
Follow your true religious precepts; don’t use them for 
your own self-aggrandizement.

Harvard students, union members and Star -
bucks employees from around the country 
are planning to protest a lecture by Star -
bucks CEO Howard Schultz at the Harvard Busi-ness School on Friday.
Schultz will be speaking to several hundred busi-
ness school students about his experiences running 
a successful business. 
He will also be promoting his new book, “On-
ward: How Starbucks Fought for its Life Without 
Losing its Soul.”
Liberte Locke, an organizer of the event, said 
Starbucks employees are angered by what they deem to be hypocrisy in Schultz’s book, in which he expresses his commitment to his “partners”— as the company calls its workers. 
Many employees of the company — especially 
union members — feel that Starbucks is one of the least labor-friendly companies in America, Locke said. 
Starbucks has been found guilty by the Nation-
al Labor Relations Board of violating labor rights, including charges of union busting and wrongful termination.
“For Howie [Schultz] to sit around and claim 
how much he loves us, it’s just disgusting,” said Locke, a Starbucks barista and Starbucks Workers Union organizer from New York. 
“Starbucks is one of the biggest union-busting 
corporations in the United States.”
Harvard union representatives said that they 
planned to support Starbucks workers in the pro-test.
Geoffrey “Geoff” Carens, an assistant librarian and member of the Harvard Union of Technical and Cleri-cal Workers, emphasized what 
he called the “phoniness” of 
Schultz’s message.
“Howard Schultz likes to present Starbucks as a 
socially responsible corporation,” Carens said. 
“In reality, conditions are really bad and getting 
worse.”
While Starbucks has garnered criticism for the 
way it has treated union leaders and organizers, 
it has presented itself as a progressive member of 
the Fortune 500, providing health-care benefits and 
stock options to some employees.
Students who plan to attend the event said they 
feel it is important to show solidarity with wronged 
workers in standing up for their rights.
“Everyone deserves a voice on the job,” said Stu-
dent Labor Action Movement member William P. 
Whitham. 
Organizers of the event said they are eager to 
send a message both to Schultz and to the business school students.
“We want him to know that no matter where he 
goes, he will be held accountable,” said Locke.
 As for the business school students, Locke want-
ed them to know “that union busting is absolutely unacceptable and unethical.”
Locke emphasized that the point of the protest 
is not to scare students away but rather to educate 
them. 
“We want to prevent [future] employers from 
becoming like Starbucks,” she said.

Florida junior right-hander Tommy Toledo throws a pitch during UF’s 9-1 win over Tennessee at McK -
ethan Stadium on Sunday. Toledo protected a 1-0 lead in the sixth, relieving starter Karsten Whitson.

After relaxing while Hudson 
Randall pitched a gem Friday night, 
the Gators’ stout bullpen flexed its muscles the rest of the weekend.
No. 3 Florida (24-5, 7-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) rode its relievers to a sweep of Tennessee (19-9, 2-7 SEC), winning 9-1 on Sunday afternoon in McKethan Stadium.
For the second straight day the 
Gators’ pen put out the fire, throw-ing four innings of relief, including three huge outs from Tommy To-
ledo in the sixth.
“Tommy did a great job of step-
ping up and getting the guys out 
today ,” junior right fielder Preston Tucker said. “One thing about our 
bullpen is we got guys that will 
come in and do the job, so we know 
all we need to do is score a few runs and we’ll get the ‘W.’”
Protecting a slim 1-0 lead, Toledo 
relieved freshman starter Karsten Whitson with no outs and runners on second and third. 
With the infield in, the junior 
right-hander induced a groundout to third before nailing a runner at the plate on an athletic, bare-handed scoop on a swinging bunt.  “That’s the first time I’ve ever 
made that play in a game,” Toledo said. “There was really no other play I had.”
After inducing a flyout to escape 
the jam, Florida responded with eight runs on nine hits in the sixth and seventh innings. 
“Right after that, we had the mo-
mentum on our side,” Toledo said. “Once we get the momentum, we’re tough to beat.”
Mike Zunino and Tucker hit 
back-to-back doubles to lead off the 
bottom of the sixth as UF scored 
three runs in the inning.  
Using a barrage of singles in the 
seventh, Florida pounded two Ten-nessee relievers for five runs, in-cluding two scorching run-scoring knocks by Austin Maddox (3 for 3, two RBIs) and Nolan Fontana (2 for 4, two RBIs).
Fontana had a monster week-
end, as UF’s shortstop was its top run producer, driving in eight on six hits. Florida’s leadoff hitter has 23 RBIs on the season, tied for tops on the team. 
Whitson made his seventh start 
of the year, tossing five scoreless in-
nings before being lifted with two 
on in the sixth.

Although it was the biggest meet of 
the season, something was off for the Florida gymnastics team on Saturday . 
“They were very flat,” UF coach 
Rhonda Faehn said. “I didn’t feel that 
they had a lot of spirit or energy.”
The No. 1 Gators’ performances 
weren’t up to their usual standards 
at the NCAA North Central Region Championships, and Florida was edged 196.550 to 196.425 by No. 12 Ar -
kansas, dropping UF to second among the six teams in Denver.
UF will move on to the NCAA 
Championships on April 15 despite nearly seeing its season come to a close, edging out third-place Boise State by just .025 points. 
“It was ugly. It was a very unchar -
acteristic perfor -
mance for us, and I really don’t have an explanation for it. There are no excus-es,” Faehn said. “I thought they fought hard, but again, this 
meet is definitely 
one I’d like to for -
get.”

 THE GATORS WON FOUR EVENTS 
THIS WEEKEND AT HOME.
By JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
 
Honoring their seniors before the season 
opener would be considered odd in most 
sports, but it’s nothing out of the ordinary 
for track and field.
In a sport where a team has only one or 
two home dates per year, this weekend’s Florida Relays may have been the only op-
portunity to see a full home crowd.
“It was great being in front of friends 
and family. You can’t beat that feeling,” 
UF coach Mike Holloway said. “Up in the 
stands, there’s a great crowd up there, so it 
was a great experience for us.”
The Gators picked up four event victo-
ries, saw senior Jeremy Postin set a UF re-
cord and put up plenty of other personal-
best times and marks at Percy Beard Track in Pressly Stadium over the weekend.
“It’s nice to know The Gator Nation sup-
ports us,” junior Gray Horn said. 
“It’s nice not having to travel,” added Pos-
tin, whose hammer throw of 65.09m/213-6 on Friday broke his own school record.
Florida’s first home date of the season 
held extra meaning for junior Christian 
Taylor.
In addition to winning the men’s 400m 
dash, Taylor was awarded the 
William R. Richardson Memo-
rial Track Scholarship, given 
to the top junior track and field athlete, and his parents were in the crowd to witness 
his successful weekend.
“(My parents) actually haven’t seen me 
run since my senior year in high school, so it was really big to get this win with my second-best time,” Taylor said.
Joining Taylor as individual winners 
this weekend were junior Jeff Demps (100m Host UF thrives at Relays

UF ROUNDUP
By THOMAS NASSIFF
Alligator Writer
 
As Alexandre Lacroix reflected on a ca-
reer defined by breaking records and setting 
standards, it was only fitting that he contin-ued the trend on Senior Day.
Lacroix, the lone senior for the No. 15 UF 
men’s tennis team, was recognized before Sunday’s match against Vanderbilt amid one of the most remarkable careers in pro-gram history.
By the end of the match, Lacroix had be-
come just the second UF player to reach 200 total wins, and he helped the Gators (13-6, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) celebrate their last regular-season contest at home with a 
7-0 shutout of the Commodores (11-8, 2-6 
SEC).
“I really tried to keep the emotion inside 
me because I know it’s hard to play tennis with that emotion,” Lacroix said. “So, I tried to keep it and just let it go at the end of the match.”
Lacroix and Sekou Bangoura Jr. clinched 
the doubles point for Florida with an 8-6 win 
over Vanderbilt’s Adam Baker and Charlie 
Jones. 
That win gave Lacroix his 200th career victory as he joined Justin O’Neal (1997-
2000) as the only other player in UF history 
to reach that mark. O’Neal recorded 208 ca-reer victories, a number Lacroix still has a chance to top this season.
Lacroix’s singles match Sunday was a 
come-from-behind win in a third-set tie-breaker over the Commodores’ Ryan Lip-man.
The final match score wasn’t at all indica-
tive of how close the action was, as Vander -
bilt proved deserving of its No. 30 national ranking despite a subpar record in confer -
ence play.
The Gators saw four singles matches 
enter second-set tiebreakers and played phenomenally as a team to close out those matches.
Bangoura, Nassim Slilam and Billy Feder -
hofer each needed tiebreakers to win their matches in straight sets. Bob van Overbeek lost his tiebreaker but won the third set to claim his victory.
The match could have turned out worse 
for Florida had it not succeeded in those tiebreakers, as the Gators have struggled in close decisions this spring.
“It was much like the Kentucky match or 
the Mississippi State match, but we just won all the close matches,” UF coach Andy Jack-
son said. “We did some things tactically bet-
ter, and we won a hard-fought victory that we were pleased with.”
UF MATCHES RECORD LOW IN THIRD 
ROUND: It’s not often in a round of golf 
that everything comes together at the same time, but that’s exactly what happened for the Florida women’s golf team Sunday at 
the Liz Murphy Invitational.
The Gators shot up the 
leaderboard, moving from 
12th to fifth with a tourna-ment course record-tying 11-under-par round. 
UF coach Jan Dowling 
has preached all year that 
her squad has the poten-
tial to stack up with any 
team in the nation, and 
the Gators finally made good on that claim Sunday.
“This is a huge confidence-builder for 
us,” Dowling said. “Our goal all season has been to peak in the postseason, and if we can take care of business in the next two weeks, we look ready to do that.”
On a day with many memorable per -formances, the most gratifying for UF was 
the 2-under-par 70 carded by senior Jessica 
Yadloczky. The team captain has struggled during her final year in Gainesville, but her impact on the team has still been substantial due to her leadership and competitiveness in practice. 
Yadloczky shot two birdies over her last 
five holes to earn her first under-par round of the season.
Sophomore Mia Piccio turned in Florida’s 
lowest score of the day. She shot a 3-under-par 69, climbing to 11th on the individual leaderboard after carding five birdies in seven holes on the front nine.
Sophomore Isabelle Lendl also played 
her best round of an impressive tournament Sunday. Lendl’s 1-under-par performance earned her a fifth-place finish.
The Gators now have a two-week layoff 
before heading to Auburn for the Southeast-ern Conference Championship on April 15. 
“We just need to do what we normally do 
to keep the momentum from this round for SECs,” Dowling said. “Our focus in practice has been our short game, and it worked well for us today, so we’re going to continue with that.”

Gee (800m run).
Demps won his event in 
10.07 seconds, improving on 
his previous personal-best 
mark at the Florida Relays of 
10.11 seconds, which he set in 2010.
As for McGee, the accom-plishments keep coming for the 
two-time Southeastern Confer -
ence Freshman of the Week 
Award winner. 
She recorded her first out-
door victory by winning the 
800m run and also anchored the 1600m sprint medley relay 
that secured UF’s only team 
victory.
Although Holloway ex-pressed disappointment in the women’s team’s performance following an unsatisfying end 
to the indoor season, it has 
picked up four event victories in the outdoor season’s first three meets.
“I’m excited about the wom-
en’s team as a whole,” Hollo-way said. “What we did in-doors is not indicative of what kind of team we are.”
The No. 1 Florida men had a 
disappointing second day, fail-ing to capture two events they won at last season’s Florida Relays.
The 4x100 relay saw the 
Gators finish third (38.91 sec-onds) behind Florida State and winner Pure Athletics.
A pro team from Pure Ath-
letics set a new Florida Relays record with its winning time, finishing the race in 38.74 sec-onds.
UF was unable to finish the 
4x200 relay because sopho-more Tony McQuay fell during his leg of the run and was too 
injured to continue.
“Tony’s been battling inju-
ries all year long, and they just 
keep popping up,” Holloway said. “Tony’s been blessed with 
a lot of great God-given talent, 
so we’ll get him fixed up. And we’ve got six weeks to get him ready for conference, so that’s 
our starting point.”
While the weekend didn’t 
produce a lot of victories and 
had its fair share of disappoint-ments, Holloway still saw it as 
a point to build on moving for -
ward.
“There are some things that 
we’re very good at it, things we’re not so good at and things 
we have to get a lot better at,” Holloway said. “What we’re going to do is sit down as a staff, talk about it, look at it, 
get together on Monday and 
get back to work.”MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

“He’s a power pitcher,” UF

pionships, Faehn said this competi-
tion wasn’t much different. 
“They didn’t come out and com-
pete aggressively,” Faehn said. “They’re all great performers, but we allowed the doubts to creep in.” 
While freshman Alaina Johnson 
finished No. 1 in the all-around, Faehn 
said she was disappointed in UF’s 
“lackluster energy” overall, and she is glad the team was able to advance despite the poor performances. 
When Florida kicked off its floor 
exercise, the outlook seemed promis-ing. 
Sophomore Marissa King complet-
ed the double layout in her routine, 
which Faehn described as beautiful. 
Johnson also had a solid performance, as both she and King posted 9.9s, placing them in the four-way tie for second in the event. 
But when the competition turned 
to vault, Faehn said the gymnasts’ landings were worse than they were at SECs.
All-arounders Johnson and sopho-
more Ashanée Dickerson managed to pull through, escaping with a three-way tie for first place.
The only event Faehn said the 
gymnasts performed better in was 
bars, as freshman Mackenize Caquat-
to snagged first with a 9.95 and John-son grabbed second with a 9.925.
But things fell apart on beam, as 
the usually solid and consistent Eliza-beth Mahlich posted a 9.225 while Dickerson stumbled to the second-lowest score of the competition with an 8.475. 
But senior Maranda Smith was 
confident the team would be able to 
fix its problems heading into the NCAA Champi-onships on April 15.  
“We all have 
good mindsets, 
and we are willing to sacrifice any-thing for the team,” Smith said. “This team hasn’t lost the will and the drive to win a national championship.”
“We’re going to put them under 
more pressure situations,” Faehn added. “We’ll be putting them in real uncomfortable positions on beam and see who is going to rise to the occa-
sion.”GYM , from page 13

For the second weekend in a row, the 
Gators went winless. 
After getting blown out 10-2 on Friday, 
No. 5 Florida (30-7, 7-6 Southeastern Confer -
ence) nearly notched a come-from-behind 
win Saturday before losing 7-6 to No. 23 Kentucky (25-7, 11-3 SEC). 
But Sunday’s loss wasn’t even close. The Gators narrowly avoided the run-
rule but eventually suffered another sweep as the Wildcats closed out the series with a decisive 9-2 win. 
“To watch us play today was pretty hard 
to swallow,” UF coach Tim Walton said.
With the way Florida has been pitching, it 
never had a chance. 
Hannah Rogers was the only Gator to 
take the mound this weekend, but her per -
formances were less than impressive. 
The freshman turned in her fourth con-
secutive poor outing since starting the sea-son 16-1. Her struggles couldn’t have come at a worse time, as senior ace Stephanie Bro-mbacher remained sidelined with a bicep injury. 
“She just wasn’t very good,” Walton said. 
“She gave up way too many hits. ... She wasn’t sharp.” 
The young righty’s woes continued Sun-
day, when the Wildcats pounded her for eight runs in the first inning. 
Leadoff hitter Meagan Aull, who went 
5 for 10 with eight RBIs on the weekend, proved to be Rogers’ toughest nemesis. The outfielder started off Sunday with 
a solo shot to left before adding a two-run homer later in the inning. 
While Rogers was able to settle down for 
the rest of the game, the damage was already done.“Hannah’s been having to throw every 
single game, and that’s been hard on her mentally and physically,” left fielder Kelsey Bruder said. 
Walton said Kentucky’s lineup matched 
Rogers stride for stride, fouling off good pitches and turning bloops into hits.
More concerning for UF than the pitching 
performance was its inability to put together quality at-bats. 
The Gators’ typically potent lineup 
seemed timid and provided little firepower, mustering only two runs on five hits and striking out 10 times. 
“I didn’t think we were aggressive at the 
plate,” Walton said. “I’ve tried getting differ -
ent players in, but it doesn’t get any better when you look at the box score.” 
While center fielder Michelle Moultrie 
and second baseman Aja Paculba combined to go 7 for 21, the rest of the lineup barely made a mark on the stat sheet. 
Power hitters Bruder, Megan Bush and 
Brittany Schutte accounted for only three RBIs and struck out 11 times, while the bot-tom of the order was nearly nonexistent.  
After a string of impressive performances 
against Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Geor -
gia, Bruder described her weekend as just 
“average.” 
“For some girls, going 1 for 3 is a good 
weekend,” she said. “But I expect much bet-
ter of myself. We have to be more aggressive, 
especially earlier in the count, and shorten up with two strikes.” 
With the team stuck in a six-game slump, 
everything from the team’s pregame meals to 
weight lifting sessions will be re-evaluated. 
“We’re going to shake up the process 
with everything we do,” Walton said. “We’ll 
turn the table over and pick everything back 
up and go from there. We’re not going down 
without a fight.”16, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, APRIL 4, 2011

It only took Kitty Cullen eight 
seconds Saturday at Penn State to 
answer whether the Gators were 
ready for their first road game in 45 days.
With one whip of her stick, the 
sophomore buried the quickest goal in Florida’s two seasons of play, one of her seven on the day, and helped lead a banner day for the No. 6 Gators (11-1, 2-0 American Lacrosse 
Conference) in a 13-7 victory over 
the No. 16 Nittany Lions (6-5, 1-1 ALC).
“It’s really hard to put into 
words,” UF coach Amanda O’Leary said of Cullen’s performance. “She just dominated the offense. Her shooting was spot on. She made very good decisions. … Just the fact of how many points she’s put on the board speaks for itself.”
Cullen, who leads the nation 
with 56 goals, tacked on five more by halftime to tie her and Ashley Bruns’ Florida record of six goals in a game.  The two have matched their shared mark six times, so it was only fitting both had a hand in the record-breaking goal. 
On the Gators’ opening posses-
sion of the second half, Bruns fed the ball inside the 8-meter arc to Cullen, who beat Penn State goalie Dana Cahill to notch her school-record seventh goal of the game.
“(Bruns) really played well,” 
Cullen said. “She kept her head up and was able to get a lot of re-ally great feeds, and we were able to 
have great options off of the shots be-cause of the way she was working the ball.”
The game 
wasn’t all posi-
tive for UF, as sophomore Brittany Dashiell suffered a concussion with less than 10 minutes left in the first half after she collided with a Penn State player and fell to the turf. O’Leary said the midfielder also cut her chin in the process, and that in-jury alone would have been enough to keep her out the rest of the game.
“When Brittany went down, it 
was definitely scary because she is one of our best players from defense to transition and offense — she’s awesome,” Cullen said. “But then other people just realized, ‘Hey , this 
is my time to step up.’”
Led by three straight goals from 
Cullen and four assists by Bruns, the 
Gators responded to their teammate going down with a 5-0 run, breaking a 5-5 tie.
Adding to the offensive surge 
in Dashiell’s stead with second-half goals were sophomores Colby Rhea, 
Janine Hillier, Caroline Cochran and 
Caroline Chesterman, who scored twice. 
“Penn State wasn’t ready for us 
to come out and play like that as a team, together,” Bruns said. “And that was the best part about com-ing out today was that we didn’t care about the distractions. We just played together.”
When the dust settled, Penn State 
found itself down 10-5 and was only able to manage two more goals the rest of the way , as sophomore goalie Mikey Meagher shut down the Nit-tany Lions’ offense with eight saves.
The victory extended the Gators’ 
winning streak to 11 (second-longest in the nation), including two in ALC play , topping UF’s regular-season 
and conference win total from all of 
last season.
