KICKOFFINSIDE
◗ At Florida, defensive tackle Dominique Easley has made 
a name for himself as much for his play as for his on-field dancing. But his story is deeper than it appears. pg. 2 ◗ Saturday’s game against Alabama will be decided on the ground. To win, Florida must rush effectively. pg. 19 
   Here is the doll. The “Chucky” 
doll. The doll that has become Dominique Easley’s famous 
accessory. The doll with the murder-ous streak. The doll that exempliﬁ  es the scariness of Florida’s 282-pound defensive tackle.
  Or not.  “‘Chucky,’ to him, it’s not a horror 
movie; it’s a comedy,” said Juan Eas-ley, Dominique’s uncle. “He laughs at the movie. It’s funny to him. … Other people would turn their head when Chucky was slicing people up. Domi-nique would laugh at it.”
  Humor comes easy to Dominique, 
his friends and family will tell you, and it has been on display from the beginning of the season. 
  Watch the Gator Walk, where he 
carries with him the doll, a birthday gift from his girlfriend. Watch on-ﬁ  eld celebrations, when he will accidental-ly knock over smaller teammates with a chest bump or, as was the case two weeks ago, clothesline Matt Elam after an interception.
  Watch him on the ﬁ  eld between 
snaps, or on the sidelines, or really anywhere you can ﬁ  nd him; Domin-ique will probably be dancing.
  He picked up his moves (or lack 
thereof, depending on who you ask) from his mother, Carine. She is of Hai-tian descent and, to hear Dominique’s father describe it, traditional fam-ily get-togethers often transform into dance parties. 
  Standing at the line of scrimmage 
on Saturdays, waiting for the oppos-ing offense to break its huddle, Do-minique will be swiveling his hips, tapping his feet, pumping his arms — even in the rare moments when neither the stadium PA nor the band provides music. 
  Perhaps because it’s easy, or per-
haps because they simply don’t care, outsiders — fans, the media, whoever — tend to accept the dancing as com-edy for comedy’s sake, not realizing it is at once funny and necessary. Danc-ing, Carine says, is how Dominique focuses. 
  “If you take that away from him, 
I’m not sure who you’re getting,” said his father, David Easley. “It would send him into a depression, as far as I’m concerned. He was raised that way.”
  Like the dance moves, Dominique 
can be misunderstood by those who don’t know him.
  Waiting in the locker room before 
games at Staten Island (N.Y.) Curtis High, Dominique wouldn’t keep qui-et; he was too busy pulling pranks and stealing stuff from his friends’ lockers. Coach Pete Gambardella said it was Dominique’s way of dealing with pre-game pressure, of keeping everyone light. Then, he would walk out on the ﬁ  eld. 
  “People might mistake Dominique 
for being this tough, grimy person from the way he plays football,” said Juan, his uncle. “You see these pictures with this angry face on. That’s com-pletely different from how he is off the ﬁ  eld. He may try to put up a front.”
  A former teammate calls him “Big 
Baby.” His Little League coach calls him “a big, sweet teddy bear.” His fa-ther calls him “Popeye,” a ﬁ  tting name for the boy who had to grow into his bulky arms and legs.
  Here is the photo. The photo David Easley still has from about 11 years ago. The photo that shows why Dominique scared unfamiliar parents.
  They thought he was a ringer, 
some older kid masking his real age so he could dominate the 8-year-olds. He was a third baseman, a catcher, a power hitter.  He was also 4-foot-11 and 130 pounds — about eight inches taller and 70 pounds heavier than the average boy his age. 
  “He was not bigger,” David said. 
“He was much bigger.”
  Suspicious parents or not, at least 
Dominique was allowed to play base-ball. He couldn’t say the same about football, which was his true passion even as a child. Youth football had weight limits, and even when he tried to play with his older brother, David Jr., Dominique was still too heavy.
  He practiced with the Staten Island 
Hurricanes each week, but on game days he watched from the sidelines with Carine, who served as a team mom. He played basketball and base-ball, but he kept talking football. 
  Once he enrolled at Curtis, where 
no weight limit could hold him back, Dominique quickly became one of the area’s elite players. He switched from linebacker to defensive tackle his sophomore year, and he thrived because of his size and surprising quickness, a product of his time on the basketball court. 
  Dominique originally committed 
to Penn State. Then he decommit-ted. Then he leaned toward Oregon. Then he went to the Under Armour All-American Game in January 2010. Then he picked Florida.
  He had not even taken an ofﬁ  -
cial visit to Gainesville. The news surprised recruiting analysts. They weren’t the only ones.   “I was shocked,” said Kelvin Din-
kins, Easley’s former Little League coach who remains close with the fam-ily. “I think his mother was shocked. … I want to say he got caught up with all the hype at the All-American Game, seeing all those other kids choose Florida.”
  As soon as he stepped on campus 
last summer, Dominique wanted to leave. He was about 1,000 miles from home, and he soon butted heads with the coaching staff. 
  In early August, reports surfaced 
that Dominique had skipped at least one practice. Rumors that he wanted to transfer soon followed. When Flor-ida played Vanderbilt on Nov. 6, Do-minique was left off the travel roster. Urban Meyer said the freshman was “not part of the team right now.”
  “There wasn’t a whole lot of com-
munication from the old coaching staff,” Juan said. “The chemistry, it just wasn’t there. It wasn’t there from the beginning.”
  Said Dinkins: “He really wanted 
out.”
  Dominique’s family encouraged 
him to stay, and he actually caught an odd break when Meyer resigned in December. Well aware of the problems in 2010, Will Muschamp called Domi-nique into his ofﬁ  ce when the coach ﬁ  rst arrived. 
  Dominique had a fresh start. 
  Here is the scrapbook. The book with pages of headlines and photos and articles. The book 
with evidence that Staff Sgt. David Easley’s boy was making a name for himself, even as David collected clips while working in Iraq and Afghani-stan.
  He ﬁ  rst shipped out to Iraq in 
2004, when Dominique was in middle school. David served in the transpor-tation ﬁ  eld, starting as a truck driver before moving into a management position in which he oversaw supplies and people being transported, among other duties.  David returned to the United States 
in 2005, but he served a second tour two years later, this time in Afghani-stan.  
  “Even though we never talked 
about it, I think it was a rough time for them,” David said.
  To raise his children, David relied 
on his family, most notably his brother Juan, who became like a second fa-ther to Dominique and David Jr. Juan would call or email David, letting him know when the boys were acting up. 
  Juan tried to keep them focused on 
school and football, tried to keep them “out of the mix,” but he knew the bur-den of having a father at war weighed on them. 
  “They really wanted (David) to be 
here,” Juan said. “There were a lot of crazy things happening (in the war). It was nuts. I was worried myself. I didn’t talk about it because I didn’t want to make them even more un-easy.”
  As Dominique progressed on the 
ﬁ  eld, Juan kept David in touch. When the Staten Island Advance mentioned Dominique after a game, Juan told his brother to look up the article online. Other family friends started mailing him the actual newspaper clippings. 
  The scrapbook now sits in David’s 
home in Goose Creek, S.C. Even now that he’s in the United States, now that he can watch games on TV or in person — “a precious sight” — David keeps adding clips to the book.  He wants to show them to Domin-
ique’s children one day. 
  When Florida played UAB one day before the tenth an-niversary of Sept. 11, players 
with military ties ran out of the tunnel holding American ﬂ  ags. 
  Before charging onto the ﬁ  eld, 
Dominique gripped his ﬂ  ag. His eye-brows were tilted down, his mouth curled slightly — a sinister look you would see on a murderous doll, the “front” his uncle swears Dominique only wears on the ﬁ  eld. 
  After running to the sidelines, Do-
minique began waving the ﬂ  ag. At ﬁ  rst, the process was ordinary, tradi-tional. Then, he started dancing.
  Here is Dominique Easley.   Contact Tyler Jett at tjett@alligator.

  Fall Student Senate elections 
ended Wednesday, but some ques-
tions about the validity of the re-sults still linger. 
  District E tallied 535 student 
voters Tuesday and Wednesday, up more than 700 percent from the fall 2010 count of 65 voters.
  Students Party member Jona-
than Ossip said party members are trying to get elections map experts to look at the numbers and con-ﬁ  rm that the District E results are an anomaly. 
  District E, the commuter stu-
dents’ district, includes all ZIP codes except those speciﬁ  ed in Districts A, B, C and D, which in-clude the areas around UF. If the registrar’s ofﬁ  ce had a student’s permanent home address and not his or her Gainesville address, that student would have been placed in District E. 
  Ossip said students receiving 
the correct ballot is vital to fair elections.
  He said when he voted in the 
fall 2010 paper-ballot elections, his address wasn’t listed under the correct district, but it was caught before he made it to the polls. He ﬁ  lled out an afﬁ  davit with his ad-dress, which was conﬁ  rmed within minutes.
  He said a similar process 
should have been used this se-mester to avoid discrepancies.

  UF will show that compassion trumps ri-
valry at the University of Alabama football 
game Saturday when the UF Greek commu-nity presents a $10,000 check for tornado relief in Tuscaloosa, Ala. 
  After Tuscaloosa was devastated by a se-
ries of tornadoes in April, UF’s four Greek councils decided to start a fundraising effort titled “Florida Greeks for ‘Bama Relief.”
  “When we get a call that Alabama needs 
help, we immediately don’t think about the football rivalry,” said IFC President Rajiv As-nani, 23. “We think, ‘These guys are our peers; let’s reach out and help.’”
  Each individual sorority and fraternity chapter has been hosting outreach events to raise funds and spread awareness including a “Pie the Student Body Vice President” and a FIFA video game tournament. 
  Meredith Lynch, Tuscaloosa Incident Com-
mand public relations coordinator, stressed the city’s gratefulness and that it will help the long-term recovery effort. 
  The money will be used for rebuilding in-
frastructure and purchasing weather radios for low-income households. 
  Asnani said each chapter was responsible 
for contributing $200 to the donation. 
  “We may be intense rivals on the football 
ﬁ  eld, but in the end we’re both two very suc-cessful Southeastern Conference universities that have a great reputation for doing great things around the world,” Asnani said.  Greeks raise $10K for tornado reliefON CAMPUS

  After six years, the Tide is coming back into 
The Swamp.
  Gainesville is about to become ﬂ  ooded with 
fans of the University of Alabama’s Crimson 
Tide, and in their wake comes the increased se-curity concerns of a major SEC rivalry game.
  “We look at all games with true signiﬁ  cance 
as a premium game,” said Maj. Brad Barber, public information ofﬁ  cer with the University Police Department. “LSU, Alabama, FSU and Tennessee are all approached operationally the same.”
  More ofﬁ  cers will be on hand Saturday, which 
is usual for games of this magnitude, he said.
  “There is a difference between when we play 
Florida State and Furman,” Barber said.
  On Sept. 30, 2006, the last time the Tide came 
to Gainesville, 70 people were ejected or arrested from the stadium, he said.
  A sold-out stadium will watch the UF vs. Ala-
bama game Saturday at 8 p.m., said Mark Gajda, assistant athletics director of ticket operations with the University Athletic Association.  The Swamp’s seating capacity is 88,000, and 
90,000 people are expected to attend the game.
  “Tailgating will be at a premium,” he said.  If cars are obstructing the ﬂ  ow of trafﬁ  c or 
parked in a non-designated area then the car will be towed by Superior Towing LLC, Barber said.
  “Along with expected increase in trafﬁ  c, peo-
ple need to arrive early and park in designated areas,” he said. “That’s the safest way to go.”
  The city of Gainesville and Alachua County 
will, as usual, be very involved in policing the game this weekend.
  “We are not treating this football game dif-
ferent than any other football game,” said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, public information ofﬁ  cer with the Gainesville Police Department.
  Some ofﬁ  cers will report to their trafﬁ  c posts 
earlier and stay later than normal this weekend, and ofﬁ  cers will be looking through neighbor-hoods for parking violations.  
  GPD contracts with University Towing, 
Valuri said.
  If you are parked on private property, it is up 
to the owner of the property to call and have a car towed, she said.    Big game calls for upped security

  The traveling Florida Modern-
Day Slavery Museum is back to show that slavery is still present today. 
  The museum will be making ﬁ  ve 
stops in Alachua County from Satur-day to Wednesday. 
  The mobile museum, brought to 
the city by the Interfaith Alliance for Immigrant Justice, displays the presence of slavery in Florida from before the Civil War to the present. 
  The museum itself is a mock-up 
of the cargo trucks used in a slavery operation from 2008. 
  “People were forced to live in it 
without any sanitation or water and you can see the shackles and chains that these workers were chained up with,” said Richard MacMaster In-terfaith Alliance for Immigrant Jus-tice assistant organizer.
  The museum’s tour through 
Gainesville will begin Saturday at 
the B’nai Israel synagogue. 
  On Monday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m 
the museum will be on UF’s Plaza of 
the Americas and will be followed by a presentation from the Coalition of Immokalee Workers organization in the CSE Building, Room E222 at 6 p.m. 
  The museum was created by the 
Coalition of Immokalee Workers and the Interfaith Action of South-west Florida.  Mobile museum educates

FUND RESEARCH PROJECTS IN THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION.
KATHERINE GREENE
Alligator Contributing Writer
As the almost $2 million they had set 
aside began depreciating, Bill and Robbie 
Hedges were not worried about losing mon-ey but concerned about how to give more.
In 2005, Bill Hedges, 87, a former pro-
fessor at the College of Education, and his wife, Robbie, 85, set up a fund of about $1.93 million that eventually will benefit research projects at the college.
However, after the money was set aside, 
its value quickly began to decline because of the stock market slump a few years later. After losing about $100,000, the Hedges decided an additional contribution was in order.
“The reason we added to it is that two or 
three years after we gave it to the universi-ty, the stock market dropped,” Bill Hedges said. “So we thought, ‘Well shucks, we have a little extra money. Why don’t we add to it?’”
The couple added $63,000 to their origi-
nal contribution, which was funded by the sale of family-owned real estate.
The Hedges, both former teachers, set up 
the trust to fund research that will benefit children who fall behind in school and drop out before graduating. Bill Hedges said these students, whom he calls “invisible children,” are becoming more common in the American education system, and noth-ing is being done to help them.
He said that after a year as a Fulbright 
lecturer at Chungnam National University in Daejon, Korea, he realized how many American students were falling behind. He said about 94 percent of children in Korea graduate from high school, while in Florida the figure is only about 67 percent. The na-tional average is not much better.
“A third of our children never finish high 
school,” Bill Hedges said. “A few years ago, the United States led the world. It’s sad. Florida is a tragic case in terms of educa-tion.”
The William D. and Robbie F. Hedges Research Fund was created as a charitable remainder unitrust, which means the funds benefit the Hedges and their family while they are alive, but after their lifetime, the re-maining assets will go to research projects at the College of Education.
Because the funds are not directly avail-
able to the college at this time, no specific research programs are planned, but the Hedges said one area that is specifically im-portant is researching preventative indica-tors that would allow teachers and parents to assess which students may be at risk.
“The early learning, that predates school 
even, is so important,” Robbie Hedges said.
Elizabeth Bondy, professor and director 
of the School of Teaching and Learning in the College of Education, had Bill Hedges as a professor during her time as a doctoral student at UF. She said the donation is right on track with the goals of the college.
“It is such an important need in the state 
of Florida and across the nation,” Bondy said. 
Bondy said much of the research done at 
the College of Education is funded by out-side grants, and the Hedges’ contribution will be extremely valuable.
The $63,000 addition to the trust will in-
crease the amount of interest collected and increase the amount of funding for future research — research the Hedges say is cru-cial to our nation.
“Ignorance and freedom don’t go hand 
in hand,” Bill Hedges said. “And with this high incidence of ignorance, you’re jeop-ardizing your freedom. We are very, very concerned about it.” FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Next, we give a this-would-make-the-best-pet-for-a-Bat-
man-villian LAUREL to Frank and Louie, the two-faced, 
two-mouthed, three-eyed cat who broke the Guinness re-cord for the longest living Janus cat, nicknamed after the Roman god with two faces. 
This last event deserves a way-to-freak-out-the-Capitol-

Thursday morning, The Onion, a satirical news organi-
zation, began posting “breaking news” on Twitter about a fake hostage situation at the Capitol. Their tweet read, “BREAKING: Capitol building being evacuated. 12 chil-dren held hostage by group of armed congressmen.” Need-less to say, the authorities were not happy, but their “cov-erage” of this fake event was hilarious. 
But now it’s time to highlight things that made us say 
“WTF” this week. 
To start off, how can we not throw a this-almost-puts-
hanging-chads-to-shame DART at the Student Govern-
ment elections. With around 535 students voting in Dis-trict E this semester compared to only 65 last fall, how can someone say that something isn’t fishy? 
Well, someone can and did say that. That’s why we’re 
proudly tossing a you-need-to-recognize-the-gravity-of-the-situation DART to SG Supervisor of Elections Toni 
Megna. We should also note SG rules dictate that the sys-tem must be tested two days prior to elections, and Megna refused to comment on whether this actually happened.
Finally, we’re giving a you-could-not-look-more-cor -
rupt-if-you-tried DART to the Unite Party. You already 
have the stigma of being a corrupt party machine. If you just joined in challenging the reliability of the election re-sults, we might take your commitment to a fair process seriously. You probably would have won all of the seats anyway, so there is no point in dismissing possible techni-cal errors. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.
Cyberbullying should be treated as a crime
It has been nearly a year since Tyler Clementi, former 
Rutgers student, committed suicide after his room-mate streamed an intimate video of Clementi and an-
other man. I remember when I first read about the tragedy in the news. I didn’t understand — how did this happen? What caused Clementi so much pain that he had to end his life? 
The reason that Clementi’s suicide elicited so much 
national attention not only stems from the fact that it de-lineated a culture of intolerance but also because it gave rise to a new problem in our society: the danger of cyber -
bullying. 
Since the evolution of the Internet in the 1990s, one of 
the most apparent outcomes has been the simple accessi-bility to cyber contact in lieu of human contact. 
However, with the invention of any form of technology, 
there are always some issues that are unforeseen and un-thinkable. As Clementi’s suicide so clearly demonstrates, the Internet is a smooth and easy passage into the dark world of cyberbullying. 
Ultimately, cyberbullying is not about intolerance to-
ward homosexuals. In essence, we are free to feel what we want about others. Whether you choose to accept the way someone expresses himself or not, there are always better ways to define your beliefs than to attack and judge. 
Fortunately, New Jersey has made commendable ef-
forts to challenge bullies in the future. By enacting the “Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights,” the state has taken a nation-al lead in deterring bullying within public schools. While the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights has grand intentions and is extremely purposeful with its agenda, it fails to specifi-cally address cyber crimes, which are often more harmful than your average hate crime. In fact, according to the An-
ti-Defamation League, “although 44 states have bullying statutes, fewer than half offer guidance about whether schools may intervene in bullying involving ‘electronic communication.’”New Jersey’s initiative in 
making this daring legislative reform is nonetheless admi-rable. But we can’t stop here. Treating cyberbullying as a rare and unique crime is a flawed approach, and we must under -
stand that it happens regularly. 
Recently, a 15-year-old fresh-
man high school student, Phoebe Prince, committed sui-cide because of prolonged cyberbullying from a group of girls who harassed her for dating an older football player. Beleaguered by hateful text messages and taunting in the form of Facebook posts, Prince could only endure so much. Students would scream at her from one side of the library, calling her derogatory names. One girl went so far as to throw a drink at her from a car while driving away laughing. While some bullies are too young to understand the repercussions of their actions, Phoebe’s harassers were 17- and 18-year-old students. They have no excuse. What’s worse is that Prince was a recent Irish immigrant.
Why couldn’t Prince’s death have been prevented? 
Why aren’t Prince’s bullies being severely punished for their unforgiving actions? Why didn’t the school feel com-pelled to intervene? The simple answer is that there is no imposed law. 
Are we going to wait for another young person to end 
his or her life just because of a lack of enforcement?  
It is time we realize that cyberbullying is becoming 
a fatal crime. Laws must be created, publicized and en-forced. 
Would this be a violation of our first-amendment 
rights? Maybe in a small, convoluted way. But our forefa-thers did not write the Constitution to invite heinous ac-tions into our society.

A recent phenomenon in the marketplace has 
become a big deal in the past couple of years. The trend I am referring to is the flood of 
“green” products on store shelves. 
You have seen these products: eco-friendly laun-
dry detergents, all-natural shampoos, sustainable paper products. Many big-time manufacturers have delved into this world with at least one or two “green” products. 
Initially , this seems like a great development. Are 
people finally beginning to realize their negative im-pacts on the environment and taking steps to reduce them? 
Unfortunately, what I believe is happening is 
something that has been termed “greenwashing.” Greenwashing is the act of wrongfully advertising something as being better for the environment when in fact it is not. Sometimes, the resources wasted on green campaigning negate any benefits the product may have had for the environment. 
Many of these greenwashing companies are large 
corporations with worldwide distributions, meaning they more than likely sacrificed their “green” ways somewhere along their path to prosperity . Truthfully , these companies would suffer dearly if their opera-tions actually went “green.” They would have to re-formulate many of their products, which would cost millions of dollars. 
What is actually happening is very similar to 
something you see on TV shows. Often, one token character of some racial minority is present in order to appease minority groups and to draw in viewers from these groups. 
The same goes for the greenwashing companies. 
They are trying to appeal to the environmentally con-scious consumers by creating “green” products. They are doing so to increase revenues, not to save the en-vironment.
For example, Clorox has created a line of green 
products under the Green Works label that they claim are natural, complete with cute illustrations of leaves on the packaging. The truth is that there is little basis for this claim. The ingredients 
for these products are not even listed on the bottles, so who’s to say what is really in these products? It is evident that Clorox created this line of token “green” products as a ploy to capture part of the eco-friendly market.
The birth of greenwashing has made it increasing-
ly difficult for people trying to decrease their harmful environmental impacts to do so. They now must sift through a sea of deceitful and outright false advertis-ing in order to actually find products and companies that are indeed “green.” 
What may be needed is stricter governmental 
regulations on how products can be labeled. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s standards for organic-certified products are an example of a good start to governing label terminology.
Fortunately, there is some hope for consumers 
who want to make a difference. Some third-party or -
ganizations have taken the lead in determining which products truly have minimal impacts on the environ-ment. 
These groups evaluate products in multiple as-
pects, from the impact of extracting resources for the products to the packaging materials they use, only recommending those that meet their strict standards of excellence. Two of these groups are EcoLogo (www.ecologo.org) and Green Seal (www.greenseal.org). 
Before I get off my soapbox, I would just like to say 
that you can prevent yourself from being conned by greenwashing products with the valuable resources I mentioned. Do not waste your chance to make an en-vironmental difference by supporting those who are just trying to line their pockets.

Speaking OutVillamil left out some details
I don’t know which budget 
Unite Party member T.J. Villamil 
was talking about in his letter this week, but it isn’t one that was passed by the Student Senate.
His letter was so full of misin-
formation that I have to assume it was an attempt to discredit the Stu-dents Party on an election day.
Villamil is the Student Body 
treasurer, so he knows Student Government is responsible for al-locating the full amount of the Activity & Service Fees it receives from the university —$12.87 per credit hour, equaling roughly $16.7 million for 2011-2012. He knows this because he was chairman of the Student Senate committee that oversaw the development of this budget last year and because these numbers are printed in the “Fi-nance for Students” packet avail-able in the SG Finance office.
It’s true that SG typically al-
locates the majority of its funds to RecSports and the Reitz Union.  But SG makes that decision. Flor -
ida law gives SG the authority to decide how the money is spent, so only SG can allocate the A&S Fee paid by students.
Saying that SG’s budget is only 
$4.8 million is like saying the fed-eral government doesn’t have full control over all of the tax revenue it receives. 
As for his next claim: that SG 
doesn’t use student funds to reim-burse SG officials for their phone-related costs? It reimburses them not only for their phone plans but also for their phones. They’re even allowed to put this money toward apps for their phones. You know, so they have the option to down-load, say , Angry Birds for official SG business purposes. 
As a former student senator 
who served on the Budget and Ap-propriations Committee, I am very familiar with the policies surround-ing student organizations that fail to spend all of their allocated funds for the year. The unspent funds are placed in SG’s reserves account, which is off-limits to student or -
ganizations. And when you don’t spend it, your budget is more likely to be reduced next time around.
Being the Student Body treasur -
er and a former budget chairman, Villamil knows all of this. So when he decides to represent himself and his office by writing a letter correct-ing alleged “factual errors” about the budget, he should at least show some self-dignity by making sure his response is factual. Especially on election day.
The Students Party has been 
nothing but honest about the num-bers from the start. It’s just unfor -
tunate how many students may have been misled byWednesday’s hit piece.

Letters to the EditorParticipants arrive at the run 
dressed in clothes they wish to donate. Before the dash begins, the clothing is removed and col-lected in trash bags, and the par -
ticipants prepare to run across campus dressed in their under -
wear.
Beau Bergeron, a UF alum-
nus, started The Great Under -
wear Dash in 2005. Since then, it has grown into a school tradi-tion and is even featured in the “F Book” as an experience that students should have before graduation.
The university approved the 
run under one condition: People must wear some form of under -
wear.
“You’re not allowed to be 
naked because that’s indecent exposure,” said Josh Kelley, a 20-year-old mathematics junior who ran in the event last spring.
The race is less than one mile 
long. It begins on Turlington Plaza, circles around Library West, goes down University Avenue and turns back toward Turlington Plaza. Participants must remain on campus, or they can be arrested for indecent ex-posure.Kelley plans to donate the 
clothing to Operation Cover-Up Gainesville, a Student Alumni Association-sponsored service project. UF is competing against FSU to see which school can col-lect more clothing by Novem-ber’s football game. The clothes will be donated to United Way, The Salvation Army and other charities. 
Although Kelley said it’s 
tough to track how many peo-ple participate in the dash each year, about 2,430 people said they participated in the spring on “The Great Underwear Dash 12” Facebook page. 
“If we get half of that, that’s 
awesome,” Kelley said. “Even 20 percent of that will be great.”8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2011

SG Election Commission to meet this morning
Officials failed to test the system prop-
erly, he said.
Supervisor of Elections Toni Megna said 
she tested the system with senators after the 
Sept. 20 Student Senate meeting, which was a week before elections began. 
Elections rules state that the supervisor 
of elections must test the voting system in front of specific officials two days before the elections.
Megna declined to comment on the elec-
tions rules.If students were placed in District E, their 
voting screens Tuesday morning would have indicated that. The page also listed each ZIP code not included in District E. Students who noticed zoning errors could select to complete affidavits with their cor -
rect addresses.
After about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, students 
who were zoned for District E were immedi-ately directed to an affidavit to verify correct address registration. 
Megna said students could have gone on 
to the SG website to check their district.
“Any students that go there are the ones 
that are interested in being educated vot-ers,” she said.
Megna said fliers directing students to 
the website were distributed during slating.
She said she didn’t know why the num-
ber of District E voters spiked this year.
“Maybe just more people live outside 
UF,” Megna said. “I don’t know.”
At 11 a.m. today in room 284 of the Reitz 
Union, the Elections Commission will hear the complaints made regarding the elec-tions, including those filed by the Students Party.
Complaints were filed before midnight 
Wednesday, and Megna said she knew of four complaints officially filed.ELECTIONs , from page 1ASSOCIATED PRESS
Officials across Florida are 
scrambling to repeal gun control 
ordinances, including bans on fire-arms in parks, buildings and other public places, before a new state law takes effect.
It adds penalties to an existing 
statute that requires governments at the local level to follow state gun laws, which are generally less re-strictive. The pre-emption law has often been ignored  — until now.
The legislation is one of 29 laws 
that become effective Saturday.
“We can restrict having clubs, 
flame throwers and hand grenades, but when it comes to firearms, we can’t restrict them,” said Kraig Conn, legislative counsel for the Florida League of Cities.
The law imposes penalties for 
violating the 1987 pre-emption stat-ute that covers ammunition and firearms.
“It merely says you have to fol-
low the law and if you don’t follow the law there are consequences,” said the law’s sponsor, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach.
The National Rifle Association 
pushed for the legislation, saying cities and counties were ignoring the pre-emption law because it had no penalties.
City and county officials could be 
fined up to $5,000 if they failed to re-peal a pre-empted gun ordinance or try to enforce it. They also won’t be able to use taxpayer funds to defend themselves or pay the fines. Viola-tors also could be fired or removed from office by the governor.Gun law

UF Ambassadors of Civility and Ethics is 
changing your typical Saturday gameday rou-
tine.  
As an effort to provide gameday attendees 
with a new method for tailgating, the Ambas-sadors will be hosting its first “Alternative Tailgating” event, with free food and games, on the Plaza of the Americas on Saturday at 11 a.m.
According to Aldreka Everett, marketing 
chairwoman of the UF Ambassadors of Civility and Ethics, people who attend gameday festiv-ities tend to get out of control while under the influence. The ambassadors hope to provide a sober environment for people to see a different side of tailgating.
“We believe that the practice of tailgating 
can be just as enjoyable and fun for everyone without alcohol consumption,” Everett said. 
The UF Ambassadors of Civility and Ethics 
is a student-based organization that provides the Student Body with information from the Dean of Students Office regarding the conduct code and their rights as students, Everett said. 
Laura Matthews, assistant director of stu-
dent conduct and conflict resolution, says ev-ery once in a while a student is found in viola-tion of school conduct on gameday. This event will hopefully provide a positive tailgating atmosphere and show students what proper gameday conduct should entail. 
Matthews hopes that a game as big as Ala-
bama will attract a lot of people to the event and student ambassadors will choose to continue the event every season, if not every game.
“It is important to have events like this be-
cause students need to be aware of their pres-ence on campus and the expectations the uni-versity has for them,” Matthews said. 
Justin Ishmael, a 19-year-old UF psychol-
ogy sophomore, is skeptical of the success of this event.
“It’s a cute idea, but this is a college town. 
It’s a nice effort to promote better values as a community, especially with an event so fam-ily-oriented as football games, but I’m not so convinced it will change traditional tailgates,” he said.Group promotes sober tailgatingON CAMPUS

There’s a SausageFest this week-
end, but women are invited, too. 
From noon to 4 p.m. Sunday, 
students and alumni can enjoy food 
and games in the Murphree Area Courtyards for its eighth annual SausageFest cookout.
The event is free and open to the 
public.
At the festival, in addition to sau-
sages, there will be grilled hot dogs and hamburgers. Vegetarian choices will also be available.
T-shirts will be available for sale 
at the event for $10, and Murphree Area residents will also have the chance to pie their favorite residen-tial assistants for $1, according to Carlos Guerrero, a Murphree Area residential assistant.
All proceeds from the T-shirt sales and the pie-your-RA activity will be donated to the Humane Society.
“It’s for a good cause and helps 
bring people together,” Guerrero said. “Not just within the Murphree area, but pretty much everyone else on campus.”
There will be a live jazz band 
performance as well as an open-mic session. Attendees can slide down a 30-foot-tall water slide, SausageF-est’s biggest one yet, Guerero said.
“It’s a Sunday afternoon with 
free food and a water slide,” Guer -

The number of same-sex households in the 
United States is on the rise, and Gainesville is 
no exception, according to 2010 census data re-leased Tuesday . 
About 650,000 same-sex couples reported 
living together. Of those, 131,729 same-sex couples reported that they were married.  
The total number of same-sex couples who 
reported living together is nearly double what it was in 2000, according to the Associated Press.
The growth in results shows that society is 
becoming more accepting, said Terry Fleming, co-president of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.
“It’s important to recognize that 
LGBT folks live in every corner of ev-ery county in the country ,” Fleming said. “And that’s reflected in the census data.”  
Because Massachusetts first legalized gay mar -
riage in 2004, the 2010 census was the first time same-sex couples could mark themselves mar -
ried and be counted as so.
Florida’s number of same-sex households 
has grown 60 percent since 2000, according to  a Sun-Sentinel article. Gainesville recorded 367 same-sex partner households in 2010, up from 226 in 2000, according to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel’s U.S. Census database.
Because the general population is still not 
completely accepting of LGBT communities, people often misreport their situa-tions, Fleming said.
“Many people are afraid 
to identify — even on an anonymous form — as gay 
or lesbian,” Fleming said.
Gainesville Community 
Alliance founder Joseph 
Antonelli said people will not respond hon-estly until they know they’re protected.
Although the census data shows about 
131,000 same-sex married couples, the number of legally recognized gay partnerships is much lower, Gary Gates, a UCLA demographer and Census Bureau consultant, told the Associated Press.
Couples reported themselves married be-
cause they feel that way, Antonelli said.
“If you’ve been with somebody for 15, 25 or 
50 years, would you not consider yourself mar -
ried?” he said.
Fleming, who has been with his partner for 
14 years, marked “married” on his form.
“If I tell you that I’m married, you know 
what that means,” Fleming said. Census: More same-sex couples living together than in 2000

Dickinson Hall’s new address, 1659 Museum Road, is located on the front of the building. UF buildings are begin-
ning to receive traditional street address to make locating by GPS easier.
� EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WILL HAVE AN 
EASIER TIME FINDING THEM ON A GPS. 
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Emergency responders and visiting parents should have an 
easier time getting around campus because UF’s buildings have 
new addresses.
The addresses have been changed to traditional street ad-
dresses. For example, Turlington Hall’s address has been changed from the name of the building to 330 Newell Drive.
The old building names wouldn’t appear on GPS devices, 
which made it hard for emergency vehicles and new parents to find their way around campus, said Frank Phillips, an associate director of UF’s Facilities, Planning and Construction.
One of the reasons the addresses were changed was to make 
sure fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles could find the campus buildings on their GPS devices quickly.
“Our paramount concern is we do not in any way, shape or 
form want to have an issue with emergency response,” he said.
The process of changing the addresses has been going on for 
about three years, Phillips said. It took about a year to get the addresses finalized.
Keith Godwin, E911 coordinator and communications sec-
tion chief at Alachua County Fire Rescue, said the lack of tra-ditional addresses made emergency responders’ jobs more dif-ficult.
“When you have a physical address, it’s logical,” he said. “It 
makes sense.”
Signs with the new addresses will be added to campus build-
ings, but the names of halls and buildings won’t change. Some campus buildings, including Dickinson Hall and the Counseling & Wellness Center, already have their address signs installed.Campus buildings get new addresses in case of emergencies

The Internet is essential for life — at least 
for Generation Y.
New data indicate that one in three college 
students and young professionals 30 years old 
and younger consider the Internet to be as im-portant as air, food, water and shelter.
The data, which were collected in 14 coun-
tries, come from the 2011 Cisco Connected World Technology Report released Sept. 21.
This is the second year the report has been 
released. Last year, the report studied em-ployee behavior and information technology policy , according to the Cisco website. This year’s report focused on the importance and role of the Internet in young people’s lives.  
About 3,000 people were surveyed this year.
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice presi-
dent for UF Student Affairs, didn’t have email or the Internet when she started college in 1988. Today, college students rely on the In-ternet as a tool to do everything from research and homework to socializing and shopping, Mastrodicasa said.
“When we had a student organization 
meeting we would call people on the tele-phone and say , ‘See you Tuesday night,’“ she said. “The Internet has become the tool to be able to do things that people did previously using other mechanisms.”
When forced to make a choice between 
having a car or the Internet, about two out of three  people surveyed chose the Internet.
Telecommunication junior Kamaron Scholl, 
21, didn’t have an Internet connection the first two months after he moved to Gainesville, but he said having one does make life easier.
“You can go online and buy a ticket for 
something, or you could spend half an hour driving to and from somewhere to physically get a ticket,” Scholl said. “I think it’s just [a] convenience that we’re starting to get used to.”
Two of five college students surveyed said 
the Internet is more important to them than dating, going out with friends or listening to music.
Food science and human nutrition sopho-
more Ruhiyyih Bannister, 19, agreed that the Internet is important but said it’s not more im-portant than human interaction.
“The Internet isn’t real life,” Bannister said. 
“You can’t substitute dating and friends with the Internet.”
In the survey , 91 percent of college 
students  said they have a Facebook ac-count.  Of those, 81 percent check their Facebook page at least once a day.  
Seven of 10 employees in the report became friends on Facebook with their managers and/or their coworkers.
Bannister said she doesn’t see a problem 
with being friends on Facebook with cowork-ers if only appropriate content is posted.  “Facebook is just a good way to connect with 
anybody ,” Bannister said.

Do you know what Brown 
v. Board of Education is? Did 
you know that Miami once was the most segregated city in the United States?
Most grade-school students 
in the United States don’t, ac-cording to a report released by the Southern Poverty Law Center. 
The report evaluated how 
extensively states’ grade schools taught the civil rights movement. 
Thirty-five states received 
F’s. Alabama, Florida and New York were the only states to receive A’s. 
The state’s grade doesn’t 
mean Florida students know enough about the movement, said Jack Davis, a UF history professor.
Davis teaches the civil 
rights movement to both un-dergraduate and graduate students and said their knowl-edge about the movement mostly is limited to famous activists, such as Martin Lu-ther King Jr., and famous sites, including Birmingham, Ala., and Selma, Ala.
“They know something 
went on in these places,” Da-vis said, “but they don’t know the historical significance of individual events.”
Paul Ortiz, a UF professor 
who teaches African-American history, asked his students on the first day of class how much they knew about the civil rights movement and learned that most of his  students had minimal knowledge.
Both Ortiz and Davis said 
students’ lack of knowledge about the civil rights move-ment is partially due to stan-dardized testing.
“With the emphasis on 
standardized testing, history is always a loser,” Ortiz said. 
The Southern Poverty Law 
Center also reported that states with less diverse populations were less likely to teach the civil rights movement.
“The problem is that too of-
ten school districts and states take the approach that civil rights history is for black peo-ple,” Ortiz said. 
All students, regardless of 
race, need to learn how they are connected to the civil rights movement, he said.Florida receives A

Sure, we walk around campus 
in our frat tanks, listen to Tiësto and watch “Mad Men” secretly wish-ing America was still that sexist. But we’re totally deep. We’re like, into politics and stuff.
So, yeah, we were all up in those 
GOP debates last week, and we have to say we learned a thing or two about debating from Slick Rick Perry: “Was it — was before — he was before these social programs, from the standpoint of, he was for standing up for Roe vs. Wade before he was against, verse Roe vs. Wade?” No doubt.
This week, we want to show you 
what we have learned, so we let two alligatorSports writers debate Sat-urday’s Nebraska-Wisconsin game. Take it away, boys.
Wisconsin (-9) will keep our free-
dom safe because…
The Badgers don’t have time to 
keep up with all this year’s GOP riff-raff. So this weekend, Wiscon-sin is going to kick it old school and channel their inner Joseph McCarthy — former Republican senator from Wisconsin — to wreck those commie bastards at Nebraska. They don’t call the Cornhuskers “Big Red” for no rea-son. Nebraska is doing everything it can to undermine this great democ-racy, and the Badgers will have none of it. The Wisconsin defense takes the phrase “Iron Curtain” to new levels, shutting down everything it has faced on the way to a No. 7 ranking in total defense. And, with Heisman candi-date Russell Wilson at the helm, the Badgers offense is sure to instill the Red Scare in its opponent’s hearts.
Those corn-picking country boys 
at Nebraska don’t have a chance.

� ALABAMA AVERAGES MORE 
THAN 230 YARDS PER GAME. 
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Florida’s players don’t like talking 
about last season. They don’t want to 
discuss the 31-6 drubbing at the hands of Alabama — and for good reason.
The Tide ran all over the Gators’ de-
fense in Tuscaloosa, Ala., a year ago, com-piling 170 yards and two scores on the ground.
“We’re not even really looking at last 
year,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. “It’s a whole new year.”
A new year and a new defense, too.Florida’s rush defense ranks fifth in the 
nation, allowing just 56.5 yards per con-test, and the team has yet to surrender a rushing touchdown. 
No. 12 Florida (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern 
Conference) hopes that continues Satur-day at 8 p.m. when No. 3 Alabama (4-0, 1-0 SEC) comes to The Swamp.
“Every game we come across is going 
to be defined by how we play up front,” defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd said. “They’re going to run on us, a lot of teams want to run on us, so we’ve got to defend the run before we can defend the pass.”
However, stopping an Alabama rush-
ing attack that ranks 19th in the nation with 230 yards per game and 13 touch-downs could prove to be difficult for a Gators facing first real rushing test against Tide Picks

Charlie Weis and Florida’s offense 
will face a unique challenge when Alabama enters The Swamp on Sat-
urday. 
The Crimson Tide defense is without 
significant flaws, ranking No. 3 nationally against both the run and the pass.  
“I always look for weak links in person-
nel, people that you can attack,” Weis said. 
“This is an unusual group because they 
really don’t have one. … It’s unique when you come against a defense that is solid at every position. That doesn’t happen that often.”
But it will this weekend, and Weis is expected to have a plan. 
So what should 
the Gators do?
At first glance, 
running 5-foot-9, 174-pound Chris Rainey and 5-foot-7, 191-pound Jeff 
Demps into the teeth of a massive Alabama defense seems futile. 
Many feel that the best counter is to 
spread the Crimson Tide out and ask John Brantley to establish a vertical passing game. But history has shown that this strategy 
won’t get it done.
Over the past four years, Alabama has 
lost just four Southeastern Conference con-tests, and the opponent’s game plan in each was simple: establish the run. 
Alabama’s defense faced 165 rush at-
tempts and 82 pass attempts — a ratio bet-ter than 2-to-1 — in those four losses. 
That formula won’t be easy to replicate. 
Regardless, UF has to make the effort. 
The reason Alabama wins so many 
games is because it stops the run so effec-tively. Those facts aren’t unrelated. To say, To beat Alabama, Florida must pound itsee FOOTBALL, PA ge 22

TELLING YOU WATTS UP
Calm down, everyone. 
From the ever-irrational every-
day fan, to college football “experts” 
like ESPN’s Mark May, people are hopping 
aboard the Gators bandwagon. 
Hoping to catch a glimpse of the next 
unforgettable Will Muschamp moment, or hoping to ride Florida’s coattails to an-other national championship celebration, people are predicting just that — that the Gators are back in the discussion with the best teams in the country, that they will be in position to compete for a BCS bowl by year’s end. 
But if there’s anything history can teach 
us, it’s patience. 
Especially when it comes to winning 
football games in the Southeastern Confer -
ence. 
Before last year’s meteoric fall from 
grace, Urban Meyer could do no wrong as the leader of Gator Nation. He was a coach-ing icon. But even Urban lost to Alabama in his first year stomping the sidelines at The Swamp. 
And it wasn’t even close. The 15th-
ranked Tide destroyed the fifth-ranked Gators, 31-3. That was the last time a Flor -
ida team failed to score a touchdown in a game — until last year’s Alabama matchup. That season ended at the Outback Bowl. 
Ron Zook beat two top-five teams during 
his first year. But in his first real SEC test, in the month of October 2002, Zook and the Gators dropped consecutive games. First, on the road to unranked Ole Miss, then, a laugher at home against LSU. That season ended at the Outback Bowl.
Even The Ole Ball Coach experienced 
his fair share of conference frustration. 
Florida beat a mediocre Alabama team 
in the second game of Steve Spurrier’s first season, but then, in October, the Gators got embarrassed in front of the entire na-tion when Tennessee whipped them 45-3 on ESPN.
Spurrier piloted his team to a 9-2 mark that season, but be-cause of lingering NCAA probation issues, the Gators didn’t play in a bowl game or have a chance to go to Atlanta and play for the SEC title. 
Had it been eligible, Florida would have 
likely played in the Gator Bowl instead of Ole Miss. 
This trend, however, isn’t limited to 
coaches residing in Gainesville. 
Nick Saban, Muschamp’s mentor and 
counterpart this week, had a losing record in 2006, his first year at Alabama. The Tide played Oklahoma State in the Indepen-dence Bowl that season, losing 34-31, and Saban managed just a one-win improve-ment in 2007. 
Les Miles had arguably the best season 
of a first-year coach in the SEC, winning three games against ranked conference opponents, but the Tigers lost in overtime to a Tennessee team that finished 5-6 that season.
Florida fans should use this template to 
temper their expectations this season. 
Don’t listen to Mark May. Don’t listen 
to The Worldwide Leader. 
Even if Muschamp pulls off the improb-
able, beating Alabama on Saturday, beat-ing the man who taught him most of what he knows, he still has the remainder of the SEC slate in front of him. And that includes a trip to Death Valley next Saturday. 
Plus, the rest of October isn’t much eas-
ier.  
If history is any indication, the chance of 
the Gators playing in a BCS bowl in Janu-ary isn’t very good. The same goes for  win-ning Saturday’s game against Alabama. 
Don’t make those Fiesta Bowl reserva-
tions just yet.

People are jumping on the Gators bandwagon in Will Muschamp’s first year, but ex-
pectations need to be tempered, as most first-year SEC coaches experience hiccups.

The Florida offense has had no 
trouble finding its groove as of 
late.
Problem is, the Gators aren’t 
showing up to the party on time.
To open Southeastern Confer -
ence play, the Gators were able to create scoring chances after half-time. 
But finding the back of the net 
proved difficult in the first half of their 1-0 win against Georgia on Friday and their 4-2 loss to Tennes-see on Sunday, when they strug-gled finding the proper spacing on offense.
No. 12 Florida (8-3, 1-1 SEC) 
hopes to buck that trend when it hosts Vanderbilt (6-4, 0-2 SEC) to-night at 7.
After the loss to Georgia, coach 
Becky Burleigh said Florida was unable to generate many good scor -
ing chances in the first half because the Bulldogs were using a very con-servative style of defense in which many players stayed closer to the back line.“We can always get better offen-
sively,” Burleigh said.  “We need to do a good job of using all the space on the field against teams that are going to put a lot of people behind that ball.
“That means the width all the 
way to the sidelines. That means the space that is behind them when they hold a high line.”
In the first 45 minutes, the Gators 
were only able to register one shot on goal between games against the Bulldogs and Vols.  
Burleigh said the Gators have to 
create holes in defenses if they are to improve their offensive consis-tency.
“We’ve got to do a better job of 
stretching them out, making those gaps wide between players, partic-ularly on our field, which is smaller than most,” she said. 
“We need every inch of space we 
can get.”
At 70 yards by 110 yards, the 
field at Pressly Stadium is slightly smaller than the average soccer field.  
Junior center back Kat William-
son said this can play to a defense’s strength when trying to limit gaps  for the offense.
“Our outside backs really like 
to attack, so having more room for them to go into is great.” William-son said. 
“But with a small field, an ad-
vantage defensively is that we can be really close together.”
One of Florida’s outside backs, 
sophomore Maggie Rodgers said the key to preventing an offense from stretching the Gators out too much is knowing where everyone else is.
“The biggest thing is communi-
cation,” Rodgers said.  
“[Outside backs] have to con-
stantly be in communication with the center back to know exactly where we need to be and limit any gaps.”
Junior forward Erika Tymrak 
said Florida should be just as effec-tive on any field, but is excited to  be home tonight after a four-game road trip. 
Florida has not lost to Vander -
bilt at home since 1997.
“It’s a great atmosphere,” Tym-
rak said. 
“The crowd is awesome. The 
fans are awesome, so we love play-ing at home.”
Florida working on offensive spacing 
Hosts Vandy tonight at 7Florida defense that, while highly touted, has 
been largely untested against the run.
Through their first four games, the Gators 
have faced just one back ranked among the top-100 in the nation: Tennessee’s Tauren Poole, who averages  72.33 yards per game. But in a 33-23 loss to the Gators on Sept. 17, the Vols abandoned the run early on.
That won’t be the case for Alabama, which 
features two running backs who average more than 200 yards per game combined.
Junior Trent Richardson, a 5-foot-11, 
224-pound downhill runner, already has 441 yards and eight scores on the ground this sea-son.
“He’s got great balance, he’s got great vi-
sion,” Florida coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s a one-cut guy. When he sees the hole he gets it north and south. … He’s always mov-ing the chains in a positive direction for their team, so he’s an outstanding player.” 
The key to minimizing Richardson’s im-
pact, Muschamp said, is to attack as a team and gang tackle him so he doesn’t break a big play. As such, Florida’s focus in practice this week was on improving tackling and wrap-ping up ball-carriers.“He’s a strong runner,” Bostic said. “If you 
try to grab his legs, he’s going to take off.”
While Richardson has been stellar, the 
Gators are approaching him like any other running back they have prepared for this sea-son — even if he isn’t like all the others.
“We treat him as a normal running back,” 
Bostic said. “He puts on his pants just like we do. He’s a little bit bigger, but we’ve got to come up and just tackle him.”
Even when Richardson 
is out of the game, Alabama has sophomore Eddie Lacy, who is averaging more than 
90 yards and a touchdown per game.
That presents a new chal-
lenge for the Gators, who have to be prepared for the 
run regardless of the running back lined up in the backfield. Still, it’s a challenge defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said his team is ready to take on.
“Every week is a test,” defensive tackle Do-
minique Easley said. “We try to prep, we try to be the best we can be in the run D. … We’re not even close to being where we should be yet.”

Nebraska (+9) will hold it down for the heart of Amer-
ica because…
Nobody blends pigskin and patriotism like Nebraska. 
Who is the best football coach from Nebraska? Tom Os-
borne. Who is the best Republican congressman from Ne-braska? Tom Osborne. 
And like all great Americans, Nebraska loves nostalgia, 
especially on the gridiron. That’s why the Huskers are play-ing football like the forward pass was never invented.  
Expect Nebraska to serve up a nice mix of ground and 
pound this weekend. Taylor Martinez will be running out-side. Rex Burkhead will be running inside. Offensive line-men will block. Receivers will block. Just like the glory days, when real men played the sport.
USA! USA! USA!Right, guys?
— TYLER JETT
 Now, on to the picks...
In first with a 19-12 record is Tyler “Red Scare, don’t care” 
Jett, who revealed that his secret desire is to form a WWE 
tagteam called The Red Scare so he can hit people with the Iron Curtain. In doing so, he managed to be childish, unre-alistic and unpatriotic in one simple sentence. Well played, Tyler!
Tied for first is FightinGators.com’s Cody “I hope Fredi gets fingered” Jones, whose season-long anger toward the Braves’ manager spilled over Wednesday night into a self-destructive rampage, at least by Cody’s tame standards. He screamed, “Well, shucks,” and drank a soda after midnight. Also, he sent Fredi Gonzalez a death threat.
Sitting in third with an 18-13 mark is alligatorSports as-
sistant editor Matt “Wheelchairs should come with all-ter -
rain tires” Watts, who can trace every bad thing he has done in life back to his Little League days, when racing to second base with his handicapped partner, he hit a rut and sent the kid into a faceplant on the clay infield. Nice hustle, Watts. 
In fourth with a 16-15 record is alligatorSports editor Tom 
“That’s messed up, man” Green, who was on the verge of tears last weekend in Lexington, Ky., when informed that half of the alligatorSports crew would be spending Friday night in Louisville hanging out with girls. Sorry, Tom, bros don’t always come before hoes. 
Also in fourth is The Associated Press’ Mark “I love your 
interviews because there is so much intellect spilling out of your low-cut dress” Long, who used Twitter to spit game to a smoking-hot Internet TV host recently. Keep up the good work, Mark.  
Rounding out the three-way tie for fourth is InsideThe-
Gators.com’s Kyle “I graduated from journalism preschool, thank you very much” Maistri, who had to endure a lecture about conflicts of interest from one of those old and boring and stupid veterans in our field. Kyle also learned you can’t call people old and boring and stupid in a newspaper, but we zoned out long before then.
In seventh with a 15-16 record is alligatorSports staff 
writer Greg “This is biological warfare” Luca, who put fel-low writer Tyler Jett out of commission this week. Greg is 8 inches shorter and 40 pounds lighter than Tyler, but he made up for that by coughing, sneezing and breathing his disease-infested breath all over the back seat of Tyler’s car.
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 14-
17 is The Florida Times-Union’s Mike “How much longer ‘till you guys go away to college?” DiRocco, who blanked this week when a fellow reporter asked the ages of his chil-dren. They’re 12 and 13, he said. No wait, 13 and 14, I think. I don’t know.

Florida linebacker Jon Bostic said the Gators have to wrap up Alabama running 
back Trent Richardson to reduce the likelihood of a long run.

“The Gators can’t run it against Alabama, 
so they shouldn’t even try,” is to accept defeat. 
The ground game doesn’t even need to 
rack up big yardage to be effective. 
The Crimson Tide held opponents to 
3.4 yards per carry or fewer in three of those losses, but teams were still able to convert first downs and control the game. 
Weis and center Jonotthan Harrison 
each said UF has developed a smash-mouth identity. 
While “the two rug rats” at running 
back, as Weis calls them, don’t scream smash mouth, UF’s play calling does. The Gators have a 1.8-to-1 run-to-pass ratio, and Demps and Rainey have sprinted UF to the No. 10 rush offense in the nation. Florida can’t abandon what it does best in the season’s biggest game. 
Marcell Dareus and Terrence Cody are 
long gone. 
Josh Chapman is a solid nose tackle, 
but other than that, Alabama’s defensive line is without NFL talent. 
Dont’a Hightower is a damn good 
linebacker, but if he has a weakness, it’s speed, and Demps and Rainey will con-stantly race him to the edge. 
And what’s Florida’s alternative to 
running it 30 or 40 times? 
Letting John Brantley air it out? Even in a run-heavy attack, he’d be 
called upon to manage the offense, com-plete a high percentage and hit one or two deep balls. 
That’s challenge enough for a passer 
who has averaged just 188 yards per game. 
Especially against an Alabama defense 
that boasts perhaps the top cornerback in the nation in Dre Kirkpatrick and might have the NCAA’s two best safeties in Mark Barron and Robert Lester. 
A better option is to ditch the hurry-
up, pound the rock and keep ‘Bama backs Trent Richardson and Eddie Lacy on the sidelines, where they can’t rack up yards and wear down UF’s defense. 
Harrison predicts a physical, line-of-
scrimmage game, and Weis knows what to expect.
“You have to go toe-to-toe,” Weis said. 
“You’ve got to be ready for a slugfest.”
The Gators wouldn’t be the favorite 
in a slugfest, but at least they’d have a puncher’s chance.

Despite facing a vaunted, third-ranked rush defense, Florida must be able to move the 
ball on the ground with Chris Rainey (1) and Jeff Demps against Alabama on Saturday.

Senior middle blocker Cassandra An-
derson does not get enough touches.
According to coach Mary Wise, un-
der-utilizing a four-year starter that led 
the Southeastern Conference in block-ing last season is a trend that cannot continue when No. 13 Florida (9-3, 2-1 SEC) takes on Auburn (8-6, 2-2 SEC) on the road tonight at 8. 
“We have to do a better job of getting 
her the ball,” Wise said. “She’s going to have a tough time scoring points for us if we don’t get her the ball.”
Anderson, a second-team All-SEC se-
lection in 2010, recorded 140 total blocks and averaged 1.27 per set, but her num-bers have been down this year.
She currently has a .293 hitting per -
centage and 0.8 blocks per set — both career-low marks.
However, a meeting with Wise fol-
lowing the Gators’ SEC opener may have put Anderson back on the right track.
“It was just about refocusing and 
trying to have my best year my senior year,” Anderson said.
In the two matches since, she has hit 
.379 with 11 kills and 4.5 blocks.
Wise specifically praised Anderson’s 
performance against Kentucky last Fri-day, calling it one of her best outings of the year.
While her statistics may not be up to 
par with previous seasons, Anderson has still made her mark in the box score in 2011.
Seven Gators have recorded at least 
10 blocks this season, and of that group, Anderson is the only one yet to record a blocking error.
Additionally, she ranks second on the 
team in total blocks and blocks per set, trailing only junior Betsy Smith.
“She works really hard at block-
ing,” said Smith, also a middle blocker. “Blocking is her favorite thing to do. She’s really good at it and that’s some-thing that all of us middles can look for -ward to.”
While Anderson has a history of 
good numbers, that success has not come easy.
She is 6-foot-1, which is considered 
undersized for a Division-I middle blocker.
Comparably, No. 9 Penn State, the 
four-time defending national champion, has three middle blockers on its roster standing at least 6-foot-4.
“It’s very seldom that we’re bigger 
than anyone else in the middle,” Wise said. “So we have to rely on [Ander -
son’s] foot speed and her IQ. She has to be ahead of the play, and she has that ability.”
Florida also relies on Anderson for 
her experience, which will come into play in tonight’s match against Auburn.
She cracked the starting lineup as a 
freshman in 2008 and has not looked back, seeing significant playing time on two SEC Champion squads.
“She just brings that level of calm sta-
bility where she’s like ‘I’ve been here be-fore. We’ve been here as a team before,’” Smith said. “She just knows what she needs to do in those situations and it’s something to pull us all along.”3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR § FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2011
WHAT TO WATCH FOR
The Gators lead the SEC with a .292 
hitting percentage. Auburn ranks 10th 
in the SEC with a .219 opponent hitting percentage.
Auburn was the only SEC team to 
push Florida to five sets in 2010, losing 3-2 (25-23, 18-25, 21-25, 25-23, 15-11) in their upset bid of then-No. 1 UF.
The Gators and Tigers will play the 
first volleyball match in Auburn Arena, which opened last October.
Florida has won 33 straight matches 
against Auburn.
