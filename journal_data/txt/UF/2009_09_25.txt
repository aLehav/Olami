Papa John's to join Reitz Union food court
By MAURA REESE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students will notice some big
changes to the Reitz Union over the
next few months.
Papa John's Pizza will move into
Subway's old location as Subway
will take STA Travel's former spot,and a new convenience store will re-
place Lange Eye Care. Freshens will
be relocated inside the store and ad-
ditional seating will be added.
The changes are being made to
help meet the wants and needs of
students, said Eddie Daniels, execu-
tive producer of the Reitz Union.
Papa John's was chosen becausestudents expressed a desire for an
on-campus pizza restaurant in sur-
veys conducted by
On the Reitz Union andCampuS Aramark, according to
Daniels.
"We're expanding variety and
creating a better atmosphere," Dan-
iels said.Stephan Buteau, a third-year fi-
nance major, eats on campus every
day and thinks Papa John's is a bad
choice.
"We don't need any more fast-
food restaurants," Buteau said. "I
don't want to eat that every day.
I want food that will keep me full,
and it has to be healthy."Subway is one of the most popu-
lar dining choices in the Reitz Union
and often has the longest line. When
Subway is relocated it will have the
extra space needed to run a third ser-
vice line, which will allow Subway
employees to serve more students

Students sell
customized
pong tables
By JOHN J. BOOTHE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Next time you're shooting a pingpong ball into a
beer-filled Solo cup, it could be over a flashing-light
display or naked Kim Kardashian mural.
GatorPong.net and its competitor, Gator Beer
Pong Tables, began as creative projects, but orders
from fellow students turned them into actual busi-
nesses.
"I just started playing with a couple of
people up here, and they said, 'Hey,
you could really sell these."'
Jason Siedel
owner of Gator Beer Pong Tables
"I just started playing with a couple of people
up here, and they said, 'Hey, you could really sell
these,"' said Jason Siedel, 21, owner of Gator Beer
Pong Tables.
According to Austin West, 25, owner of Gator-
Pong.net, playing beer pong combines basketball
with drinking by shooting pingpong balls into beer-
filled cups on a table. If a shot is made, a member of
the opposing team has to drink the cups contents.

See Story, Page 17.UF alumnus Michael London, who got the
idea for the company after his wife's failed
to find a pair of Gators underwear.
"It seems like everybody caters to guys,
but there's just not much out there for
women," London said.
He said GatorPanties.com gives women
the chance to express their loyalty to UF in
subtle ways.

Vegetarians protest
climate change
EnVeg has declared war on
climate change, and the weapon
is diet change.
Eight students from the stu-
dent organization enVeg wrote
messages on the sidewalk out-
side Library West early Thurs-
day morning describing how
diet affects the Earth.
"Animal agriculture = cli-
mate change" and "Animal ag-
riculture uses 1/3 our oil" were
just a couple of the messages.
Livestock production ac-
counts for 18 percent of global
greenhouse emissions, accord-
ing to a report from the Food
and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations.
"We try to take every oppor-
tunity to expose people to plant-
based and vegan food," enVeg
spokesman Chris Cano said.
Carlos Mateo, a health sci-
ence senior and member of en-
Veg, was present at the event
and helped write some of the
messages.
"I decided last year to lower
my meat consumption," Mateo
said.
"Two or three days of the
week I don't eat meat. It's actu-
ally pretty easy."
Carnivores can relax though
-the goal of enVeg is not to
convert everyone at UF to veg-
etarianism.
"We realize not everyone is
ready to make the change .but
if every American gave up meatSUNDAY

Law school earns No. 2 spot in bar exam pass rate
* FLORIDA STATE RANKED NO. 1.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF law graduates are continuing to raise
the bar.
More than 86 percent of Levin College of
Law graduates passed July's Florida Bar Ex-
amination, according to numbers released by
the Florida Board of Bar Examiners Monday.
UF ranked second in the state, coming in
behind No.1 Florida State University's 91.4
percent passing rate.
July's numbers showed an improvementfrom February's results, when UF ranked
seventh with 64.9 percent of graduates pass-
ing.
Levin College of Law Dean Robert Jerry
noted that only 37 graduates took the exam
in February, versus the 328 graduates who
took it in July.
"The February exam is an outlier," he
said.
According to Jerry, UF started graduating
fewer students in December than in May last
year, which would explain the differences in
numbers.
"I'm not happy about those results, but
the reality is we had fewer graduates takethat exam," he said.
He hesitated to say that the passage rate
alone is an effective way to rank law schools
in the state.
However, he did note
that when comparing this
figure on a class-by-class,
year-by-year basis, UF has
ranked No. I in 11 out of
the last 12 years.
UF English senior Bren-
ton Wildes is considering
attending UF's law school,
and he said the passage rates didn't make
much of a difference in his decision.John David Zarate, a UF psychology and
English junior who also plans to attend the
school, said the statistic does play a role in
making law school look appealing.
"At the end of the day, you want go out
and practice when you get out of school," he
said.
"You can't do that if you're failing the
bar," Zarate said.
Jerry said the college is constantly think-
ing about how it can help students do better
on the exam.
As for the fact that FSU took first place this
time around, Jerry was cordial on the matter.
"I congratulate them on it," he said.
Restaurant will take Subway's current spot
PAPA, from page 1
faster, Daniels said.
Thousands of people pass through
the Reitz Union every day, and the in-
crease in foot traffic following the open-
ing of Pollo Tropical and Cheeburger
Cheeburger was one of the major factors
that led to the need for some changes.
"We need more seating space, andthe space on the ground floor is under-
utilized," Daniels said.
Additional seating will be added in
the ground-floor corridors and in shad-
ed areas surrounding the Reitz Union
to accommodate increasing numbers of
diners.
"The Reitz is an old building, built
about 1967. Campus has outgrown the
current facility," Daniels said. "We needmore space."
A master plan assessment of the union
will begin in a few weeks to address the
issue. Architects have been hired to draw
up a plan of a new and improved Reitz
Union. It may involve expansion, Dan-
iels said.
"You won't see a physical change
soon," Daniels said. "We're planning for
the future."REITZ UNION CHANGES:
Subway will move into the space STA Travel
used to occupy on the ground floor
Papa John's Pizza will move into Subway's old location

which was located on the ground floor

Local bakes treats to fund puppy's surgery
By MARIA PIQUET
Alligator Contributing Writer
When visitors knock at Megan McCoy's door, two brown
balls of furry happiness barrel to greet them.
But for one, the action is painful and difficult.
Romeo, 9 months, was diagnosed this summer with hip
and knee dysplasia, an abnormal development in dogs that
causes joints to come loose from their sockets, making walk-
ing and running difficult and painful.
"His knee is out of place 90 percent of the time," said Mc-
Coy, Romeo's mom. "It's hard for him."
To correct the dysplasia, Romeo needs a $1,300 surgery.
To raise the money, McCoy started Romeo's Recipes, selling
homemade cookies, cupcakes and birthday cakes for dogs.
"I thought it'd be something different," McCoy said. "If it
doesn't work out, I'll start saving up myself."
Knee dysplasia is common among Pomeranians, McCoy
said. Romeo's knees sometimes come out of their sockets,
but he pops them back in and takes medication to help him
walk.
McCoy bakes the treats in her kitchen and uses all-natural
products. The main ingredients in her recipes include peanut
butter, cheese and carrots.
"Every dog likes peanut butter," McCoy said. "You can't
go wrong.",
McCoy got the idea for Romeo's Recipes from her mom.
"I've always made treats for Rowdy and Romeo," McCoy
said. "I made cupcakes for Rowdy's last birthday, and my
mom said,'You should start selling them."'
Romeo's Recipes has raised $105 so far in the two weeks
since it started.
Rowdy's Smoothie Bars, Rocket's Peanut Butter Cookies
and Roxie's Low-Calorie Snacks are among the selection of
treats.
McCoy named the treats after her other dog, Rowdy, her
mother's dog, Rocket, and her grandmother's pooch, Roxie.
"Roxie is the chunky one, so she's the low-calorie snack,"
McCoy said.
After raising enough for Romeo's surgery, McCoy will to
continue the business to raise money for other dogs in need.
But right now, it's all for Romeo.
"After that, we'll see," she said.Ana Goni-Lessan / Alligator Staff

"You go to a party where they
play on a kitchen table, and that's
cool," West said. "But if you go to
a party, and they have a dedicated
beer pong table, in my view, the cool
factor goes up."
With the businesses only weeks
old, word of mouth has been instru-
mental in bringing in early orders.
And these tables can be as cus-
tomized as possible.
"If a couple of girls are absolutely
obsessed with Hannah Montana, we
can lacquer her on the top," Siedel
said.
Each business takes a different
approach in creating the tables. West
paints the table like a canvas. Siedel's
creations are more complex and in-
clude LED lights under the cups to
make them glow and automatic ball-
washers for a more sanitary game.
"Our No. 1 factor is portability,"
Siedel said. "They come with a strap,
they fold, the legs are removable;
it's probably the greatest thing ever
since the koozie."
Both companies also have to deal
with the ethical question of selling
tables to underage buyers.
"If a couple 16-year-olds have
enough cash to buy a table, then hey,
more power to them," Siedel said.
For more information, visit Gator-
Pong.net. For an interview with the
table creators, visit alligator.org.

Almost O
42-year-old Eugene
has lived on the
streets for 7 years
Most people see Eugene as homeless. He would
disagree.
"I've got a tent, and that's my home. So no, I'm
not homeless."
"I've never had a dull moment. I got a
damn good life."
Eugene
Gainesville resident
The 42-year-old has lived without walls and win-
dows for seven years.
Eugene says he makes about $500 per week. Most
is spent on an assortment of drugs, although he says
he's not addicted.
"The drugs don't do me. I do it."
Despite the drugs, Eugene works every day of the
week. He can usually be seen working at downtown
bars and restaurants cleaning bathrooms, taking out
trash and for a couple dollars, he'll even find you a
parking spot on a busy night.
Always smiling and joking with his co-workers,
Eugene relishes in the good moments.
"I've never had a dull moment. I got a damn
good life."
-PHOTOS AND TEXT BY JEREMIAH STANLEY
CLOCKWISE FROM LEFT: After a long night's work, Eugene heads home on his
only form of transportation -a bicycle. He generally works until 4 or 5 in the
morning.
Eugene sits outside his usual spot in front of Rue Bar in downtown Gainesville.
From his perch, he's able to talk with pedestrians and find work.
Eugene "lights up" from a downtown bench as part of his daily ritual. Because
he does this in public, he is constantly on the lookout for those who might be
watching.
Eugene walks his bicycle out of Tent City on his way to the St. Francis House for
lunch. Because of his late-night schedule, St. Francis lunch is usually Eugene's
breakfast.

he Department of Darts & Laurels is starting to feel
a bit fatigued. We're realizing we haven't attended
enough class to actually pass our first exams, we've of-
ficially lost all of our school supplies and our back-to-school
haircuts have morphed from shaggy-chic to somewhere in
between mullet, puffball or worse. Basically, we miss our
moms. If our hectic schedules allowed us to jet home for the
weekend, we'd run into the arms of the women who would
point us to scrapbooks of our previous academic achieve-
ments, take us to Target and buy us some Dixon Ticondero-
gas and remind us that we're not feral, despite our dishev-
eled appearances.
Because we can't actually get that kind of reassurance right
now, or gain access to some rejuvenating home-cooked Ital-
ian food, we'd like to dedicate to our moms this summer's-
finally-starting-to-seem-like-a-distant-memory edition of.
Darts & Laurels
Subway's meatball marinara just doesn't do the trick.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced its nominees
for 2010, and we feel like the people in charge of picking
them are suffering from the same fatigue we're feeling right
now. We can sort of understand how KISS and Genesis made
the list (emphasis on "sort of"), but our heads are collectively
spinning over the selection of LL Cool J. While we appreci-
ate the fact that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is including
rap music, we'd like to throw a this-is-equivalent-to-giving-
R-Kelly's-"Trapped-In-The-Closet"-an-Oscar-nod DART at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for considering "Mama Said
Knock You Out" worthy of formal recognition.
We'll be rooting for the Stooges, thank you very much.
Arkansas resident Julia Grovenburg just found out she
has become pregnant not once, but twice. She is one of 11
reported cases of superfetation, or double impregnation,
ever documented. After conceiving once, doctors discovered
a second fetus that formed about three weeks later from a
different egg. For taking what could possibly be the scariest
news ever like a champ, we'd like to present a this-could-
only-happen-in-Ar-Kansas LAUREL to the most fertile per-
son alive.
What's scarier than getting pregnant twice? Finding out
the babies aren't yours.
Somehow, fertility clinicians in Ohio implanted a woman
with the wrong embryo. Due in two weeks, the newborn will
be returned to its biological parents instead of living with the
woman who carried it for nine months. For subjecting some-
one to a reversed, nightmarish and Michael Cera-less ver-
sion of "Juno," we'd like to throw an epic-fail-sperm-whale
DART at the faulty fertility clinic.
We know that our parents watch shows like "Dancing
With The Stars," and we can't help but wonder what they
think of Tom DeLay. For performing an initially disturbing
but ultimately hilarious rendition of "Wild Thing," we'd like
to present a LAUREL to the former house majority leader.
He's already made it to the second round of the show, but
he's up against the artist behind the unforgettable "Aaron's
Party (Come Get It)," Aaron Carter. We don't really under-
stand the appeal of this show to begin with, but it seems a bit
unfair to put a 62-year-old Republican politician in a dancing
contest against the guy who released a song called "That's
How I Beat Shaq" when he was 13.
Finally, because we miss our dogs as much as we miss our
parents, we'd like to send a we-didn't-know-Pomeranians-
had-knees-under-all-that-fur-but-it's-great-that-you're-try-
ing-to-save-them LAUREL to Megan McCoy for selling dog
biscuits to finance knee surgery for her dog, Romeo. Plus,
given our current hairstyle status, we feel like we can empa-
thize with Pomeranians more than usual.
That's all for this week, kiddies. If you have the chance
this weekend, go visit your mamas, papas and critters if you
got 'em.

Students should vote in SG elections
D on't vote.I mean, statistically only 20 percent of the Stu-
dent Body votes each election, so chances are if
you are reading this you A) are a student and therefore
B) will not be voting for your student senators. But hey, it
isn't that big of a deal. Voting is overrated anyway.
To begin with, you wouldn't get to vote for me. In
my mind, that is the only legitimate reason for vot-
ing, and since I am not up for re-election this cycle, you
should probably stay at home and not risk the barrage
of "Have you voted yet?! Well either way, let me tell
you about the __ Party! We advocate for students!"
that awaits you.
But to be fair, people often pretend there are other
reasons to vote besides the fact that I am on the ballot
(crazy, I know!). Let us now deconstruct the other "rea-
sons" to vote.
The most common reason to vote is "It's your mon-
ey.
Yes, we all pay into Student Government's $14.4 mil-
lion pot of money with the Activity and Service Fee we
pay per credit hour. But as a student at our esteemed
university, you probably don't use any of the services
the money goes to.
I know that I for one never work out at any of the
Rec Sports facilities or play intramurals. I wouldn't be
caught dead eating at the Reitz Union on any day of the
week that ends in "Y." And I can look past the fact that
I am a member of several SG-funded student organiza-
tions. Besides, Bright Futures probably pays your A&S
Fee, and we all know how I feel about that.
What about the fact that SG officials have directly
fought for our rights regarding alcohol regulations offKyle Robisch
letters@alligator orgcampus, worked to repeal the rave
ordinance that forces bars to close
at 2 a.m. and are working to cre-
ate a 24-hour study facility on cam-
pus? Psh, I say.
Again, most of these things are
irrelevant.
I feel confident saying abso-
lutely no UF students have ever
engaged in a game of beer pong, thus would not have
been threatened by the student conduct changes UF ad-
ministrators were pushing last year.
I've never been to a crush party downtown or at
Midtown, let alone drank at any of the bars until last
call at 2 a.m. And I don't study. ever.
Finally some deranged political science students
claim we need to vote because we can actually affect
real change here at UF.
To this I respond, nay nay, my child. We all know
that Student Senate is just made up of one big, happy
political party.
There are no minority parties, debates on bills or im-
portant resolutions passed each night.
Student Body President Jordan Johnson may have a
full vote on the Board of Governors, but who cares?
The Board of Governors is just the highest governing
body of UF. I get to vote on who I think will win in my
fantasy football league each week -that's more or less
the same thing, right?
Go ahead, don't vote. Clearly SG here at UF doesn't
affect your life.

Expenditures prove irresponsibility
Last campaign the Unite Party promised that it
would build a new parking garage. This campaign
the Unite Party promises to build a new Reitz Union.
What's next, a pyramid on Turlington Plaza?
The fiscal irresponsibility in the current Student
Government is incredible. Tens of thousands of dollars
are wasted on free meals, cell phones and parking de-
cals, all while the Unite Party promises massive proj-
ects that are impossible to do in the middle of a reces-
sion and budget crisis.
I'm happy to support the Orange and Blue Party,
which has an honest platform full of real ideas, not
empty promises.
Support sustainability, support cutting waste from
the budget, support transparency in government, sup-
port online voting.

Students should vote to nix "I Voted" stickers
During next week's election, voters will have the
chance to put an end to wasteful spending in Student
Government and prevent students from being coerced
into voting. The "I Voted" stickers initiative petition
campaign I ran this summer collected 1,211 signatures
from students who were appalled after learning SG
spent close to $1,900 on unnecessary "I Voted" stickers
for the Spring 2009 election, even though there were
about 50,000 unused stickers left over from previous
SG elections.
The purchase of stickers is another example of
wasteful spending within SG that I have been fighting
against as an Orange and Blue Party senator. Not only
are stickers a waste of money, but stickers are also used
by the Unite Party to coerce Greek houses into voting.
Unite requires the Greek houses that support them to
appoint a house representative who is responsible for
creating a voter board that lists all the house members.
The members are then required to bring back an "I Vot-
ed" sticker to prove that they have voted.
The existence of voter coercion within SG is unac-
ceptable. The Unite Party should be ashamed for wast-
ing student money on stickers that are used to coerce
students.
Next Tuesday and Wednesday,vote against coercion
and wasteful spending by voting in favor of this initia-
tive. Students should vote in SG elections not because
they are forced to but because they want to.

UF will renew Kentucky feud
after '08 chomp controversy
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
When No. 10 Florida (6-3-0)
hosts Kentucky (3-2-3) tonight at
7, there will be blood, sweat and
tears.
UF midfielder Lindsay Thomp-
son promised.
The rest of her team reiterated
that guarantee, although not in
those exact words.
Tonight's match marks the be-
ginning of Southeastern Confer-
ence play. Every team is familiar
with each other, and that makes
the games more heated. After go-
ing 11-0 in regular-season SEC
matches last year, the Gators are
prepared to be the conference's
least popular squad.
"(SEC teams) don't only hate
us; they hate our school, they
hate our coaches, they hate us as
individual players," goalkeeper
Katie Fraine said. "The crowds
are always annoyed by us. They
just think of us as rich snobs who
get what we want and win all the
games and have everything they
don't."
Fraine said UF is disliked with-
in the conference because other
schools are jealous of Florida's
nice athletic facilities and the suc-
cess of the football and basketballteams in recent years.
"A lot of the girls in the SEC are
from Florida, and they didn't get
offers like we did or they didn't
get to come to one of the top-10
schools in the country, so it's ob-
viously going to fuel the rivalry,"
she said.
The fact that UF's first SEC
game is against Kentucky is fitting,
as last year's meeting between the
two teams epitomized heated con-
ference play.
SoccerThe Gators came
into the game in
Lexington with a
top-20 ranking.
The Wildcats
were 3-6-2. But that
did not matter, as
Kentucky took a 2-0 lead in the
first half.
When UK forward Giuleana
Lopez scored the second goal in
the 38th minute, she mockingly
Gator chomped down the side-
lines.
"I don't even know what I was
doing," Lopez said in a phone in-
terview. "Adrenaline was just go-
ing. I probably motivated them."
UF came back in the second
half, scoring goals in the 66th and
67th minute, and the game went to
overtime.
"Everyone definitely took note
of (Lopez's celebration) and theyused that as a little more push in
the second half when we were
down 2-0," said sophomore Tah-
nai Annis, who scored UF's first
goal.
The Gators completed the
comeback in overtime when the
then-freshman Thompson scored
from 15 yards out in the 103rd
minute. It was Thompson's first
game-winning goal.
"I remember seeing the ball go
past the goalie's hands and being
so excited, and my whole team ran
over to me," Thompson said.
What happened after the
team gathered around Thomp-
son revved up the hostility. In re-
sponse to Lopez's earlier celebra-
tion, some of the Gators ran down
Kentucky's field doing the Gator
chomp.
"It's our chomp," Fraine said.
"We're allowed to do it whenever
we want, and if someone's going
to do it in our face. it's a throw-it-
back-in-their-face thing."
Lopez said she ignored the cel-
ebration, opting to shake hands
and leave.
But not everyone felt that way.
While UF celebrated, TV cam-
eras caught Wildcats goalkeeper
Sydney Hiance flipping off her op-
ponents.

dle fingers.Steven H Keys/ Alligator

Gators men will kick off season with home tourney
* THE GATORS FINISHED 2008
RANKED NO. 11 IN THE NATION.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
The UF men's tennis team will open its
fall season this weekend with the Gator Invi-
tational at Linder Stadium in Gainesville.
The team is returning the majority of its
players from a group that finished 18-9 and
was No. 11 in the ITA rankings a season
ago.Among the returning key players are
Carlos Cueto, Alex Lacroix, Joey Burkhardt,
Antoine Benneteau and Johnny Hamui, all
five of whom are listed in the ITA preseason
rankings.
In fact, the only players not returning to
action will be Tyler Hochwalt and Jeff Da-
damo. The Gators hope their departures will
be offset by the addition of talented fresh-
man William Federhofer.
"He's one of those guys that hasn't re-
ally gotten his chance, and I think he's going
to contribute here at Florida," coach Andy
Jackson said.Despite his promise, playing time for
Federhofer could be hard to find on one of
the deepest and most talented teams in the
nation.
The number of ranked
players on Florida's team
(five) is exceeded only by
Virginia, which has six.
Of those players, the
most is expected of Cueto
and Lacroix, as both are
Jackson ranked in the preseason
top 25, with Cueto at No.
11 and Lacroix at No. 23.While Cueto will not play due to tendi-
nitis in his left hand and foot, Lacroix is ex-
pected to see significant playing time. Lacro-
ix, who stands only 5 foot 11, overcomes his
lack of power with foot speed and tenacity.
"I try to take the ball early and make the
other guy move, do some drops shots and
fight on every point," Lacroix said.
This style has his coach convinced Lac-
roix can be one of the best in the nation.
"I think he has a chance to be in the run-
ning to win the NCAA championship this
year. He's improved as much or more than
anybody," Jackson said.

UF VOLLEYBALL
Gators look to improve consistency in return to O'Dome
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
Upon returning to Gainesville after the
team's longest road trip since 2003, coach
Mary Wise made sure to remind the team
where it played its home matches.
"We passed the O'Connell Center, and I
pointed it out to the players and told them
that was where they play, just in case they
had forgotten," she said.
No. 5 Florida (8-1, 2-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) will make its return to the O'Dome
tonight at 7 as UF faces Mississippi State (4-9, 0-2 SEC) before hosting Alabama (4-8, 2-0
SEC) at 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.
The Gators have not lost a regular-season
home SEC match since a defeat against Ten-
nessee on Nov. 14, 2004, and it looks as if
that streak will continue through these next
two matches. UF has an all-time set record
of 102-3 against Mississippi State, and the
Gators have never dropped a match to either
of the teams they will face this weekend.
But UF still has some things that need
to be improved. Sophomore outside hitter
Kristy Jaeckel pointed out an area the team
could improve on -consistency.
That aspect of the team's game almostproved to be its demise last weekend, as Ole
Miss pushed it to five sets on Friday after
14 UF service errors, but then Florida hit a
season-high six aces as it
swept past Arkansas on
Sunday.
"We just need to focus
on every match and ev-
O ery game," Jaeckel said.
"Right now, we are really
focusing on our consisten-
Wis cy because that is going to
Wise play a major part in how
well we do this weekend."
But after the long road trip, the sopho-more believes her team is as mentally tough
as it has ever been.
"Having to play out there on the road
and having to keep that mental edge is a
good thing to get used to," she said.
Wise is pleased with where her team
stands as the Gators return home with just
one loss, and the coach does not regret
scheduling the tough road stretch to start
the season.
"Looking back at it, I feel like playing
in [the Tampa Twice Tournament] was the
right thing to do," Wise said. "I felt like we
did great coming back from the trip with
only one loss."

UF FOOTBALL
Gators to take on Wildcats, illness
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Florida fans better hope Joe
Haden gets better in a hurry.
The junior is one of the lat-
est players to be affected by
flu-like symptoms and was held
out of Thursday's practice along
with safety Major Wright. UFcoach Urban Meyer said the two
should be fine to play against
Kentucky (2-0, 0-0 Southeastern
Conference) in Lexington on Sat-
urday.
"Haden's got to. Haden will.
Haden don't go, I'm not going,"
Meyer said.
Starters Aaron Hernandez,
Jeff Demps and Jermaine Cun-
ningham were all limited withflu-like symptoms against Ten-
nessee last weekend, and six
more players missed practice
earlier this week, including
starting outside linebacker A.J.
Jones.
Meyer said the Gators (3-0,
1-0 SEC) have had about 35 cases
of illness in the past three to four
weeks.
The team has been taking
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF cornerback Joe Haden was the latest Gator to come down with flu-like symptoms. Coach Urban
Meyer said he expects the junior starter to play against Kentucky.I
precautions against spreading
the sickness by isolating play-
ers who have shown signs of ill-
ness and encouraging players to
wash their hands frequently.
Ole Miss suffered from a
similar outbreak two weeks ago
when more than 20 players were
held out of practice with the flu.
"Certainly it's on every-
one's mind and consciousness,
and we're trying to minimize
(spreading it) the best we can,"
safeties coach Chuck Heater
said.
Florida has a bye next week-
end and will have two weeks to
get healthy before traveling to
LSU.
But extending its 22-game
winning streak against Ken-
tucky could be a bigger test than
initially thought with so many
players limited due to illness.
With senior linebacker Bran-
don Spikes and sophomore wide
receiver Deonte Thompson nurs-
ing injuries already, the Gators
could be forced to lean heavily
on their reserves to carry them
into the bye week.
"I'm just going to blow the
whistle, and whoever runs out,
runs out," Meyer said.
Fortunately for UF, the game
doesn't kick off until 6 p.m.,
which gives the team more time
to heal up and get ready for the
game.
"Just to get our guys up and
get them another day away from
that sickness, I'm glad it's 6
o'clock," Meyer said.
Moody has shown he deserves more opportunities
Next time (if) Emmanuel Moody gets a
carry in The Swamp, change up that
"Moooo" cheer a little and just say
"More."
In the limited amount of time he has touched
the ball this season (13 carries, 131 yards),
Moody has shown he can contribute to Flori-
da's offense, and not just in the fourth quarter
of blowouts.
At the very least, I'd like to see him get some
more opportunities. Odds are you would, too,
and I can't understand why the coaching staff
doesn't seem to feel the same way.
Against Tennessee on Saturday, Moody
came in on the second drive, and on his first
touch, he hit the generous hole on the rightF7 bi ] side of the line, juked a
corner and sprinted to-
F ward the sideline before
being tackled for a 23-
yard gain that would be
the game's longest gain
Mike McCall from scrimmage.
McCall-in' It It was his first action
Like I See It since being yanked after
mmccall@a ligator org fumbling against Troy.
The laid-back Texan
looked pretty jazzed up
after the carry, and the crowd was behind him.
The coaches must not have been.
Moody was replaced by Chris Rainey right
away, and Rainey took handoffs up the mid-dle on the next three plays, gaining 0, 11 and
0 yards. Then Brandon James took an option
pitch for no gain.
Florida ran the ball eight times on the drive
after Moody's carry. What I don't understand
is, if the Gators were planning to run anyway,
why not let Moody touch the ball again?
On his other two carries of the day, he was
flipped over by Eric Berry after a missed block
by a receiver, and he and a few linemen moved
the pile 8 yards on his final touch.
Moody has shown that he's a tough, power-
ful runner with the shiftiness to break off some
long carries. To me, he seems a pretty good

Miami is flying high due to the play
of quarterback Jacory Harris, but the
Hurricanes face their toughest test yet
when they take on Virginia Tech this
weekend. We left it up to Mike DiFerdi-
nando and Kyle Maistri to debate who
will win in the newest edition of the al-
ligatorSports Brand Picks Column.
MIAMI WILL COVER THE -3 SPREAD
BECAUSE .Tyrod Taylor isn't quite
the Mike Vick clone he would like to
be. T-Mobile has been anything but
since he decided to act like a child
and refuse to run to make some kind
of point about his subpar ability as a
passer. Taylor has just 10 yards rush-
ing through three games. But hey, at
least he has a 47.6 completion percent-
age. -MIKE DiFERDINANDO
VT WILL COVER THE +3 SPREAD BE-
CAUSE: I can't deny Miami has shown
a type of offensive potency that hasn't
been seen in South Florida since Bran-
don Meriweather did his best Floyd
Mayweather impression against FlU a
few years ago. Despite that, the Hok-
ies pride themselves on tough defense
and special teams, which will be the
difference in a home game for VT.
-KYLE MAISTRI
Now, on to the picks!
In first place with a record of 17-12 is
Mike "People just like me" DiFerdinan-
do, whose column about horse racing
prompted an amazing amount of fan
mail, resulting in even more unbeliev-
able amount of self-praise from DiFer.
In second at 14-15 is the Miami Her-
ald's Joe "Did anyone ask about the
baby?" Goodman, who had the news
sense to ask safeties coach Chuck Heat-
er how one of his players was handling
becoming a dad this week.
In third place this week with a re-
cord of 13-16 is the Orlando Sentinel's
Jeremy "Do you ever do yoga?" Fowl-
er, who will have nothing to blog about

El don't care that Chad Ochocinco planted Bengals fans in the stands before
he made the Lambeau Leap. It's even more impressive to me that he picked an
end zone and then scored in it. .Russian soccer club Zenit St. Petersburg has
a ton of cash and a plan to become one of the world's premier teams. Their first
move? Trying to take Andrey Arshavin back from Arsenal. Good luck with that.

NUMBERS
Wins in a row for
Florida, the nation's
longest active streak
and a new school record.
2 Wins in a row for U F2 against Kentucky.
2 5 Average margin
* of victory for the
Gators against
the Wildcats in the Urban Meyer
era.
Margin of victory for58 the Gators against
the Wildcats last
season.
9 Touchdowns for Tim
Tebow in his two years
as a starter against
Kentucky.
S Touchdowns for Kentucky
in the same two-year
span.since Lane Kiffin and Urban Meyer have quit throwing mud at each other.
In fourth place with a 12-17 record, we have the Gainesville Sun's Ed
"Man, I want to get in that dance class" Aschoff, who is not quite high enough
on the totem pole to make the trip to Lexington this week. Instead, he'll camp
outside the football stadium for the next all-female hip-hop class.
Tied with Ed at 12-17 is Mike "I must have contracted the swine flu from
the football team" McCall, who has claimed to be "sick" for the past week
despite the fact that he shows no signs of illness.
It's a battle of the ankle biters in sixth place, with Bobby "Mike Teel is
only one more injury away from seeing the field for the Seahawks" Callovi
and the Florida Times-Union's Mike "She looked like she just walked out of
the Twin Towers" DiRocco, all tied up at 11-18.
Despite his questionable choice of descriptions, DiRocco is lucky enough
to be flying to the game this weekend, while Bob will have to settle for a
booster seat in the back of our rental van.
Alone in eighth place with a record of 10-19 is Kyle "I could catch four
passes for 30 yards" Maistri, who took so many shots at his beloved David
Nelson this week that we fear their relationship is beyond repair.
And tied for dead-last place with piss-poor records of 7-22 are our own
Phil "Have you heard I'm taking the LSAT this weekend?" Kegler and the
Palm Beach Post's Ben "These college girls look 10 years older than me but
are actually 10 years younger than me" Volin.
MCCALL, from page 17
alternative to having Tim Tebow run the ball 24
times, as he did on Saturday.
Coaches said most of those runs weren't de-
signed runs, but they must not be counting zone
read plays as designed runs. They leaned on
Tebow in the ground game, and that strategyIf you haven't heard, Phil is taking the test that will determine his entire
future and quite possibly the fate of the world Saturday instead of coming
with us to Kentucky.
Ben, on the other hand, has fallen in love with college life so much since
he started graduate school that he's considering rushing a frat this spring.
Sure, it would probably take a little time away from his job, but you can't
really put a price on cheap beer and even cheaper women. Right, Ben?

I've always said the offense is at its best when that unless he gets some carries.
