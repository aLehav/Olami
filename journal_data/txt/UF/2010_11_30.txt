The commemorative plaque read, “21 years of 
service,” and his worn out uniform — a pair of 
heavily scuffed boots, a tattered jacket and bright yellow helmet — was arranged in front of the closed casket. 
Gainesville firefighter Robert H. Gasche’s 
friends called him “Buddy .” More than 600 of those friends, family and coworkers attended his funeral on Monday.
A week earlier, 54-year-old Gasche died in a 
car accident at 6:30 a.m. in Baker County, return-ing from a hunting trip in Georgia.
Even before Gainesville Fire Rescue got a call 
from police in the area, Deputy Chief Tim Hayes knew something was wrong when Gasche didn’t arrive for his 8 a.m. shift.
“He never comes late to work,” Hayes said. 
“That’s not Buddy .” 
Many at the memorial service agreed that he 
was most known for his dedication.
“He wanted to be in somebody’s life, making 
a difference in somebody’s life,” District Chief Pat Lewis said.
Others remembered him for his sense of hu-
mor.

Pa. woman rescued from pickup stuck in tree top
EVANS CITY, Pa. (AP) — Rescue crews had to use ropes 
and ladders to retrieve a western Pennsylvania woman from 
her pickup truck after it ran off a road and landed in tree tops about 30 feet above ground in a ravine.
Police say they’ll be citing 33-year-old Dana Bowser for 
driving too fast for conditions on Route 68 near Evans City. That’s about 25 miles north of Pittsburgh.
State police say Bowser lost control near a culvert that 
carries the highway over Connoquenessing (kaw-nuh-kwah-NESS’-ing) Creek. Police say Bowser told them the road was icy.

n THE MAN ROBBED A BANK OF 
AMERICA ON ARCHER ROAD.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Alachua County detectives are searching 
for a man who robbed a Bank of America on 
Monday afternoon.
The robber walked into the bank at 7100 SW 
Archer Road at about 1:45 p.m. and placed a 
black bag on the counter, said Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey.
The robber didn’t say anything but passed 
the teller a note making it clear that he wanted money and that the bag contained explosives.
Other customers, not knowing about the 
danger, continued with their transactions as the teller gave the robber cash.The suspect got away with the money. As 
is standard procedure, the bank lobby was immediately closed and an employee alerted 
authorities. The drive-thru remained open, Forgey said.
Detectives, officers, and-
FBI officials looked for  wit-nesses in the area.
The suspect is described 
as a 6-foot-4-inch white 
man, about 300 pounds, and wearing a gray T-shirt, Forgey said.
“He’s a very distinctive, large individual, 
and the photos are very clear, so we’re hoping someone can help us find him,” he said.
Anyone with information should call ASO 
at 352-955-1818 or leave an anonymous tip 
with crime stoppers at 352-372-STOP and may 
be eligible for a reward up to $1,000.Search on for bank robber

Gainesville residents came out and par -
tied for a cause Monday night, helping to 
raise money and awareness in preparation 
for World AIDS Day on Wednesday.
Carmen Joy, a junior painting major 
at UF,  organized the event at 2nd Street Speakeasy because the cause is one she feels passionate about.
“It’s been put on the back burner, and it’s 
one disease that is actually 100 percent pre-ventable,” Joy said.
The event began at 7:30 p.m. with a cover 
of $5, 100 all of which went toward MAC AIDS Fund, which helps improve the qual-
ity of life for those living with AIDS in local 
and international communities, she said.
The $5 also bought participants a raffle 
ticket toward gifts like a MAC makeup bas-ket, products from Salon Raven and a fra-grance and beauty basket from Macy’s.
A portion of proceeds from drinks also 
went toward the fund. Joy said she hopes 
to continue the fundraiser as an annual or 
semi-annual event.
“If this year is successful, it creates a 
good foundation for future years,” she said, 
“which is actually my goal.”Student’s downtown party raises money for charity

A group of students at UF is wrapping up its monthlong 
collection of clothes, food and hygiene items to benefit victims 
of domestic abuse.
Every November for the last five years, Eta Sigma Gamma, 
a health honorary, has arranged a collection to benefit Peace-ful Paths, a Gainesville organization that provides emergency shelter and relief to victims of domestic abuse. This time, the 
group has set up 20 locations across campus and Gainesville, 
where students and members of the community may drop off items, Secretary Sarah Phillips said. 
Phillips, a third-year health education and behavior major, 
said that last year the group received more than 4,000 items. This year, Eta Sigma Gamma hopes to exceed that number. The collection will continue until Tuesday at 5 p.m. 
“A lot of times they have to leave and take nothing with 
them and they must start their new life with no resources,” she said.  “It’s difficult to start a job if you have no clothing.”
For Phillips, it’s about the children. She said she struggles to 
imagine what the abused women and children have to go through on a daily basis. 
Peaceful Paths is a place that can shelter 
them and prepare them to start their new lives, 
she said.
Lori Anglon, an outreach advocate and coordinator for 
Peaceful Path’s Adopt a Family program, said the organization offers a multitude of services to domestic abuse victims, includ-
ing a 30-bed shelter, transitional housing and support groups 
for children.
But the facility’s inventory is getting low, she said. The do-
nations from the collection will directly benefit those in need, and gift cards to local grocery stores and nonperishable food donations are still needed. 
Jocelyn Peskin, director of outreach and development, 
said the prevalence of domestic abuse in the community is eye-opening and reaches across all socio-economic boundar -
ies.  Peaceful Paths serves more than 750 families a year in its 
outreach programs and between 150 to 200 in its emergency 
shelter and transitional facilities.
Not only does the organization provide shelter and hous-
ing, but it also provides legal help, support groups and coun-seling for adults and children, she said.  
Peskin, who has worked for the organization for five years, 
said the organization excels in keeping administrative costs low in order to direct funds toward clients’ needs. Peaceful Paths is funded 85 percent by grants and 15 percent by donations.
Nicole Capille, a public relations officer for Eta Sigma Gam-
ma, said she plans to donate three bags filled with clothes and other needed items. 
“Everybody needs a little extra help sometimes, especially 
people in tough situations,” she said. Group collects food, clothing for local abuse shelter
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DALLAS — Former President George 
W. Bush has pledged not to publicly criti-
cize his successor, Barack Obama, but he did offer some praise Monday during a live broadcast on Facebook to promote his new 
book.
Bush participated in an hour-long discus-
sion on Facebook Live with the site’s found-
er and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and was asked what he thought the current ad-ministration was handling well. The former president responded that he liked Obama’s policy on Afghanistan.
“I think the idea of putting more troops 
in was something that I can applaud,” Bush said. “I also appreciate some of the educa-tion position. As I understand it they do believe strongly that accountability is nec-essary in order to achieve excellence in the classrooms.”
As the discussion started, Zuckerberg 
asked Bush why he decided to appear on Facebook. Bush quipped: “Because you’ve got a lot of people paying attention to us, and I’m trying to sell books.” 
He then told Zuckerberg that he loves 
entrepreneurship and a country that could help make someone like Zuckerberg able to realize his dream and, in turn, create jobs for many people. “Yours is a really interesting 
company, and plus: I’m shamelessly mar -
keting,” he said.
Bush, whose book, “Decision Points,” 
was released earlier this month, visited Face-
book headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., field-ing questions from Zuckerberg, Facebook employees and those watching online who submitted questions during the broadcast on the company’s streaming video channel.
“I’ve written this book because I recog-
nize there’s no such thing as accurate short-term his-tory. I want to give future historians a perspective: mine,” he said, adding, “I’ve also written it for people who wonder what 
it’s like to be president.”
Zuckerberg told Bush 
that he admired him for 
sticking with what he thought was right.
Bush said that after moving from Wash-
ington to Dallas he became a “Blackberry person” but is now an “iPad person.” When asked what songs he had on his iPod, Bush said he didn’t use it anymore when rid-ing his mountain bike: “I like to hear the birds.”
Bush quickly revised the statement, jok-
ing: “That’s not true. I’ve got ‘Decision Points’ on my iPod.”
On more serious questions, Bush said 
he still believes Iraq has the ability to be a stable democracy. “It’ll work. We just have to hang in there,” he said.
After the conversation turned to the re-
cent release of a quarter-million classified diplomatic files posted by WikiLeaks, Bush 
said, “Leaks are very damaging and people 
who leak ought to be prosecuted.”
“When you have a conversation with a 
foreign leader and it ends up in the newspa-per, they didn’t like it. I didn’t like it,” Bush said.
Bush praises president during Facebook broadcast“It’s been put on the back

actually 100 percent preventable.”

“The 20th century was a time when that 
property gave birth to babies,” UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen said. “The 21st centu-
ry is going to be where that property gives 
birth to companies.”
The square will include the Florida In-
novation Hub, a facility that is intended to support start-up companies based on UF research. That facility broke ground in June and is expected to open next fall.
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe said the 
project only further bolsters the city’s posi-tion as a top per capita job creation area in the state.
“Innovation Square will be the anchor 
for this employment renaissance,” he said.
The project is expected to generate 3,000 
jobs.
With all city commissioners in atten-
dance, he expressed their support for the 
development.
“It has very strong support from the city 
of Gainesville.”
Brian Beach, senior vice president for 
administration and business ventures, 
emphasized the role of the entire commu-nity in the development, noting that UF is spearheading the project — not taking ownership of it.
“This is not a UF development,” Beach 
said. “It is not the UF campus, and these are not UF buildings. It will predominately be on the tax rolls.”TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 5

n INTERNSHIPS CAN COST MORE THAN $10,000.
By MIKE FINNIGAN 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Each year, students applying for internships are looking for 
an edge in the application process—even if they have to pay. 
That’s according to Sarah Viskovich, a 20-year-old public 
relations major at UF. Viskovich is an alumna of Dream Ca-
reers, an organization that secures internship positions in 
foreign and domestic companies for students. The service 
is available only to those who can pay the tuition, however, 
which can exceed $10,000 for an eight-week internship.
 “At first I thought it was a little sketchy,” Viskovich said. 
She paid $8,000 for her summer internship with a Broadway public relations company in New York City.
She said this initial impression proved to be false as the 
one-time fee paid for housing in a New York University 
dorm, resume and interview critiques, and a 24-hour staff 
available to answer any type of question she might have.  The program also hosted students on weekend excursions 
to New York City landmarks.
“It’s pretty much what I wanted out of my summer in one 
easy package,” she said.
But companies such as Dream Careers are not without 
controversy. Mike Ohanyere, a fourth-year sports manage-ment major at UF who works as a career ambassador at UF’s Career Resource Center, said paying for services that are al-
ready offered at universities is unnecessary and unjust.
“When you have free career services, you should take ad-
vantage of it,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense not to.”
He said the existence of such companies is unfair to 
equally qualified students who can’t afford to pay for sum-
mer internships.
“It puts [other students] at an extreme disadvantage be-
cause you’re already paying for those services at your col-lege,” he said.
Ohanyere said the Career Resource Center offers a vari-
ety of services to students, including resume and personal 
statement critiques, mock interviews and advising from full-
time staff members.Service charges

Fire chief remembered him as good-natured
Chief Gene Prince said. “He could 
take a joke and he could milk it all day long, and it’d still be as funny as the first time you heard it.”
Those who worked with him 
said he was also a skilled carpenter and he’d use his free time to craft things for the office.
Before becoming a firefighter 
with GFR, he was a paramedic for Alach-ua Fire Rescue.
In 2005, he helped 
respond to emergency calls in South Florida after Hurricane Wilma as part of search-and-rescue task force.
“We’re all better to have known 
him, to have worked with him and to have had him in our lives,” Prince said.

Today’s question: Should hats be 
allowed on the House floor?Monday’s question: Do you think WikiLeaks is right to release classified information?
129 TOTAL VOTES30% YES70% NO
WikiLeaks spewed out a bunch of classified 
American diplomatic documents this week, and it was disheartening to learn that what 
passes for statecraft these days could easily be mistaken for a worldly version of Us Weekly.
That the documents were all stolen and given to 
WikiLeaks by a young gay dude lip-synching Lady Gaga only ups the ante on the farcical nature of our spy net-works.
Bradley Manning, giving plenty of ammunition to 
those in favor of keeping Lady Gaga fans out of the U.S. 
military, is quoted in London’s Guardian newspaper tell-
ing a fellow hacker that he “would come in with music 
on a CD-RW labeled with something like ‘Lady Gaga’ … erase the music … then write a compressed split file. No one suspected a thing ... [I] listened and lip-synched to 
Lady Gaga’s ‘Telephone’ while exfiltrating possibly the 
largest data spillage in American history.”
It is of vital importance to the future of our country 
to immediately outlaw the access of critical national se-
curity documents to military or non-military personnel while they are listening to music featuring Lady Gaga, with additional punishment written into the law for any sort of fist-pumping or air drums. 
The latest document dump by WikiLeaks mainly in-
volves transmissions by our various ambassadors and diplomats that amount to snarky and inane musings about world leaders — most of which are patently obvi-ous to even the most casual observer of geopolitics.
Back in the day, the fight against communism honed 
our spies in the cutthroat, zero-sum game of internation-al espionage. 
Now, in the mushy age of global materialism, we have 
spies like us.Exactly what is gained in the 
intelligence community when one spy sends an e-mail to his boss about how Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is a creepy old guy who parties too hard?  
Berlusconi looks like a rapey ver -
sion of Count Chocula, and modern Italy is only globally relevant if you 
are into soccer or making aggressive hand gestures. 
One congressman actually wants WikiLeaks to be 
classified as an international terrorist organization.
If spreading gossipy personal observations and judg-
mental pop psychology constitute a terroristic threat, Twitter and Facebook are an Axis of Evil far worse than anything conjured up by a willful misreading of the 
Quran.
This WikiLeaks document dump is the ultimate dick 
move as far as world diplomacy is concerned.  
America may not be able to get any favors from any 
other countries for a hot minute, but even President Ba-
rack Obama can tell you that we aren’t exactly the most popular kid on the block right now.
Our spy networks were exposed as uncommunicative 
and largely ineffective after the Sept. 11 attacks, so our government forced them to start sharing information be-tween themselves more freely in order to hopefully pre-vent future assaults on our way of life.
But how vigorously can we defend “our way of life” 
when the brains behind our global political machine are gathering information that wouldn’t be out of place in a supermarket checkout line?

Soon-to-be Speaker of The House John Boeh-ner will soon add anoth-
er title to his name: Fashion Police.
Florida’s Rep.-elect Fred-
erica Wilson, known for her 
grandiose and bedazzled 
hats, has made it known she 
intends to keep her fancy-schmancy hat-wearing tradi-tion alive in Washington. But to do that, Wilson must first challenge a 173-year-old ban on wearing hats on the House floor. 
Not only will the fate of 
Social Security , tax cuts and energy bills lie in the hands of Speaker Boehner, but the top dog in the House of Rep-resentatives will now be the star of Washington’s own “What Not To Wear.”
Calling the ban on hats in-
side the Congressional cham-
bers “sexist,” Wilson wants to 
chitchat with Congress about Congress’ fashionable future. 
While we don’t find any-
thing sexist about Wilson’s claims of a congressional hat embargo, we don’t see any 
huge deal with members of 
Congress voting on allowing its members to don a stylin’ flapper or sweet top hat. 
In fact, we applaud Wil-
son’s quirky claims of her freedom to wear bejeweled cowgirl hats. Hats often define historical contexts, including 
the flapper of the ‘20s, the top 
hat, the bowler and don’t we even have a song about the tri-pointed Minute Men hat? 
But for a matter this triv-
ial to take up congressional time is silly when we should be focusing on, you know, cutting unemployment and 
the deficit and other not-as-
important-as-an-anti-hat-rule issues. 
As we hope Marie Antoi-
nette would have said, “Let them wear hats.”Kyoto No-Go
Shame on U.S. for not 
signing treaty
Beginning Monday, 15,000 world delegates, journalists and others swarmed to the sunny and spicy Cancun, Mexico, to discuss how in the world we should deal 
with the pending global climate crisis. 
And the 193-country assemblage couldn’t come at a more 
appropriate time when 2010 is poised to tie the record for hot-test year in the last 131 years of record keeping.
Can we get a Naples-Florida-Had-A-Temperature-Of-86-
Degrees-Sunday amen? 
But the meeting is sure to do little except make the world 
angry at the inability to get anything done as our thermom-eters creep higher and our shorts stay out longer. 
For the past 13 years, for example, the high and mighty, 
spit-in-the-face-of-Mother-Nature U.S.A. has refused to join 
the U.N. in signing the Kyoto Protocol, a binding pact de-
signed to greatly reduce fossil-fuel emissions. 
Citing irreconcilable differences of sorts with its economy 
and environmental salvation, the U.S. is merely lukewarm about signing any type of binding accord to reduce its envi-ronmental impact.
President Barack Obama’s recent order to raise fuel ef-
ficiency of automobiles in the U.S. is, indeed, a fine start to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, but sadly, it does 
not go far enough. 
If we intend to avoid a self-destructing, overheating planet, 
every country, including the U.S., must agree to put substan-
tial effort into reducing and reversing climate change, and we must stop these foolish stories about our economy dipping into the doldrums with a greater value on the environment. 
Even if the stories of economic collapse at the hands of 
proper environmental management were true, how much worse could things really get?

When I was accepted to UF (after being rejected four 
times), I yelled. That’s how excited I was.
I thought UF was this amazing school. UF, in 
my mind, hired the best faculty. All professors had profes-sional experience. All students earned an education that 
would help them win Nobel Prizes, Pulitzer Prizes and NFL 
MVP Awards.
UF didn’t focus on the fancy letters behind professors’ 
names.
UF didn’t, because of tenure, keep lousy professors who 
couldn’t teach or research.
UF didn’t spend $750,000, some from stimulus money, on 
a 21st Century News Laboratory just to forget the managing editor who would oversee the lab.
This lab, which is designed to teach students how tech-
nology and new media are changing the way news is deliv-ered, was intended to be used by students during free time and by classes. A managing editor would then help students on multimedia projects, ranging from videos to photo galler -
ies to wiki projects to whatever.
UF searched for the perfect candidate for more than six 
months. They couldn’t find one. Oh wait, that’s not true. The search committee did find one. His name is David Frank.
The committee couldn’t hire him. He has 25 years of expe-
rience at The New York Times. He transitioned from photo editor to video journalist. He knows multimedia journalism. But he doesn’t have a master’s degree. He doesn’t have fancy letters after his name.
Maybe, UF, being highly learned doesn’t mean being 
highly educated. Frank is highly learned.
Maybe, UF, you’re right. Maybe my expectations for this 
university were just a tad bit too high.When I was accepted to UF as 
a journalism student, I imagined Pulitzer Prize winners and the best journalists would teach me. Journal-ists who worked for the top news 
organizations: the St. Petersburg 
Times, The New York Times.
I never imagined that UF would 
say, “I’m sorry, Mr. or Mrs. Distin-guished Professional. We don’t like 
accomplished faculty members. We only hire people who’ve done nothing but go to school.” Good job, UF.
I’m not saying that having fancy letters behind your name 
is a bad thing. But when all you’ve done with your life is earn 
degrees, and you’ve never done anything professional, then 
I don’t want you near a lectern. I don’t want you teaching.
Norm Lewis, Ph.D., is a professor worthy of praise. He’s 
one of the best lecturers, and he produces A+ research. But this journalism professor was the editor-in-chief of three newspapers and a newspaper publisher. He didn’t earn his Ph.D. and leave it at that. He earned the Ph.D. after he did things with his life. He came to UF after he worked.
Don’t think this is limited to journalism. I don’t want the 
doctors performing my future prostate exam to learn how to stick their fingers up my butt by unprofessional professors.
You shouldn’t teach a medical student how to be a doc-
tor unless you’ve been a doctor. You shouldn’t teach an ar -
chitecture student how to build hotels unless you’ve built hotels.
Learning from the book is fine and dandy - as a supple-
ment to real-world experience. Do something with your life. Get your Ph.D. or master’s degree if that’s what you want, then use that knowledge to accomplish something.
Kevin McGeever, a recent applicant for the managing edi-
tor position at the news lab, has a master’s degree.
But he also has 26 years of experience as an editor at the 
St. Petersburg Times. He was a print editor until 2004, when 
he switched to senior editor of the Times website. As his 
resume says, he “led a culture change at the nation’s 15th-largest newspaper, transforming a print-centric newsroom into a web-first publishing environment.”
UF, at least you got this one right. You haven’t hired 
someone unqualified for the news lab. You decided that it’d be better to stall the search until you could find a premier candidate. And thanks goes to search committee member David Carlson who recruited people like McGeever. And 
this time, you’ve made some amends. When you re-open the 
search in December or later, you’ll look for the best candi-date, even if he or she doesn’t have a master’s degree.
Perhaps, UF, you can redeem yourself.Make yourself the university I once thought you were. 
Teach engineering students how to be professional engi-neers. Teach education students how to be teachers. Teach journalism students how to be journalists.
Remember the principles of education: to educate. Ten-
ure is a gift to those who may be fired for having radical ideas (i.e. communism) that weren’t accepted by others. It wasn’t intended to protect pathetic professors. Protect aca-demic freedom, not lousy work.
Fire bad professors — and ignore tenure.Then hire McGeever or Frank — or both. Hire someone 
with professional experience, even if he or she doesn’t have a bachelor’s degree.
Andrew Pantazi is a journalism senior.UF should hire faculty based on experience, not degreesColumn

If there’s one thing I’ve learned from my 
time working in retail, it’s this: Santa Claus is the anti-Christ.
While many students were at home spend-
ing Thanksgiving with their families, I was 
still in Lincoln, 400 miles from home. I do have 
some family here, so I wasn’t alone, but it’s kind of like dancing with someone else’s wife: It works OK, but it’s just not the same. In three and a half years at college, it’s the first time I’ve experienced even a hint of homesickness.
And why was I here? Because I had to be to 
work at 6:45 Friday morning so people could save a few bucks on crap that isn’t worth buy-ing anyway . One of my co-workers summed it up pretty well when he greeted me on Friday 
by saying, “Happy screwed-up American pri-
orities day .” 
I was fortunate enough to work at a place 
that didn’t open until 7. I feel sorry for the peo-ple who work at places like Walmart or Target and had to be at work ridiculously early. 
I don’t fault the stores. They’re just trying 
to make money to get into the black for the year. It’s the consumers who are the problem. 
Do these people really think they have noth-
ing better to do than stand in line the night of Thanksgiving so they can buy a new TV? Personally , I consider sleep to be much more 
important. I guess I’m 
just weird.
It’s not like this is anything new. Christmas 
has been completely stripped of its meaning for years in favor of rampant consumerism. The real significance of the holiday is pushed aside and, for the most part, just gets lip ser -
vice. People may put up a nativity set in their homes, but then they become preoccupied 
with what they need to buy.
I fail to see how spending money faster 
than the Obama administration honors a humble carpenter who was born in a stable 
and never in his life cared about wealth or ma-terial possessions. A fat man in a red suit can hardly measure up to the gifts given to us by a child lying in a manger. Christmas isn’t about 
packages wrapped in paper; it’s about a baby 
wrapped in swaddling clothes.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not necessarily 
saying people should just stop buying stuff for Christmas. But that should be a secondary concern. Spending time with the people you love is far more important.

of Nebraska.
Holiday season needs to be about people, not consumerismUWire

Alligator Staff Writer
In 1994, President Bill Clinton introduced a 
policy called “don’t ask, don’t tell,” which lets gay 
men and lesbians serve in the U.S. military as long as they keep their sexuality secret. The policy, a compromise that allows them to serve despite a ban 
on gay and lesbian service members, prohibits their 
superiors from investigating without evidence.
Since then, the policy has been upheld despite 
widespread opposition from civilians and service members — most recently last month when a U.S. appellate court blocked an injunction on the en-forcement of “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
But under the strategic discord and political red 
tape — at the heart of the issue — are the men and 
women who live under a policy that forces them to 
live in secrecy. Here, former, current and future service members share their stories.
s s s
Michelle is in love.
The 22-year-old Army mechanic 
considered herself straight when she 
enlisted but began a long-distance relationship with a girl she knew from home. They broke 
up, but Michelle soon fell in love with her best 
friend and roommate, a sweet girl with brown eyes.
“We went and did everything together,” 
Michelle said. “You never saw us apart.”
Two years later, the two are engaged, and 
Michelle wants everyone to know how happy she is. But when she talks about her fiance, she changes “she” to “he.”
“It sucks, having to keep my relationship a 
secret,” she said.
But even if the policy is repealed soon, Mi-
chelle doesn’t plan to tell her fellow soldiers. So far, she’s been lucky — the few people she’s told have been supportive. But she’s afraid that if she came out to her whole unit, they might start to treat her differently.
“As much as I would like to tell everyone about me and who I’m with, and as much as everyone else who is gay would like to tell the world, I think it would be best to not lift ‘don’t ask, don’t tell,’” she said — if soldiers started coming out, she fears it could cause more problems than it would solve.
“What if I come out to everyone, then my 
roommate feels uncomfortable sharing a room with me?” she said. “My unit will have to ei-
ther find someone who is OK with it and move 
me into that room or put me by myself.”
Michelle hates having to lie when people 
ask why she hasn’t had her wedding yet.
“There are times where I want to tell every-
one just so they know,” she said.
But she won’t tell them — not now. Maybe 
not ever.

Walker Burttschell didn’t tell.
But he didn’t go out of his way to 
hide his sexuality, either.
“I didn’t feel like I had to,” said Burttschell, 
a former Marine discharged under the policy .  
“I just didn’t think it was anyone’s business.” 
In high school, Burttschell participated in 
JROTC, and every summer, he went to a Na-
tional Guard summer camp. The day after Sept. 11, he dropped out of the University of West Florida to become a Marine.
His roommates and friends knew or sus-
pected he was gay , he said, but didn’t care. 
“It was against everything the Marine 
Corps told me I should be,” he said. “It’s about morals and values and being honest about who you are, but I had to lie about who I am.”
But he had openly gay friends who had 
served, and he didn’t think the policy was taken so seriously, he said. “I got the wrong impression.”
One day when Burttschell was stationed 
at Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, he was 
out of the barracks and another Marine went 
through his e-mail. He found messages be-tween Burttschell and his boyfriend. The rumors started. Burttschell knew if his 
sergeant and others found out, it would even-tually get back to his commanding officer. At the same time, a good friend and fellow Ma-rine was being discharged under the policy. 
He dreaded being forced to give up the 
most important part of his life, and he was ter -
rified that his religious, conservative family would find out why he was discharged.
Sick with fear, paranoid and depressed, he 
was put on suicide watch. Within two months, he was discharged.
Now, he travels with groups like the Hu-
man Rights Campaign and Servicemembers United to speak out against “don’t ask, don’t tell” and support equality.
“The most important message is letting 
people know that sexuality is not a big deal, especially in [my] generation,” he said. “The majority of people I served with — the ma-jority of people I still know who are serving right now — couldn’t care less if you’re gay or straight.”
The number of “don’t ask, don’t tell” sup-
porters is small, he said, and mostly within the 
religious right. 
“Unfortunately , our community hasn’t 
come together strong enough or powerful 
enough to fight it.”

Daniel has perfect vision, gets good grades and can sprint half a mile without breaking a sweat. He also 
likes to dance to Lady Gaga.
When he came out, his friends told him 
they’d already known he was gay. His mother was reluctantly supportive. His father told him he’d never understand but loved him anyway.
When Daniel, 19, told friends and family of 
his plans to enlist in the Air Force, they were quick to remind him of “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
“It was just an immediate answer of, ‘Well, 
you can’t do it,’” he said. “And it was just ag-gravating, the fact that people were so quick to shoot me down.”
But those close to Daniel knew the policy 
wouldn’t stop him.
“It doesn’t make me angry because I don’t 
let it,” he said. “I don’t understand why it’s a problem, though. If you’re dying and someone saves your life, why do you care what they’re doing in the bedroom?”
But the people Daniel meets now, as he 
begins basic training this week, can’t know the secret it took so much courage to tell his friends and family.
He knows that beyond his duty to protect 
Americans from their enemies, his responsibil-ity will be to protect his fellow soldiers from knowing his sexuality.
For a moment last month, he celebrated. 
When Judge Virginia Phillips ordered a stop to the policy’s enforcement, Daniel made a re-lieved declaration on his Facebook page.
“Now that I can say it,” his status read, 
“I’m gay and going into the military ♥ .”
But since a federal court of appeals put a 
stay on Phillips’ injunction days after her rul-ing, he has been less open.
Of his eight piercings, Daniel has removed 
five. He deleted his online accounts so no one can find photos of him and other men and use them against him.
He knows he has to pretend to be someone 
else to serve his country , but it won’t be easy . 
The hardest part, he said, will be taking a step 
back from the dignity he finally felt revealing  his sexuality to his family and friends.
“It takes so much to come out and be ac-
cepted,” he said. “My whole world changed, and to pretend that never happened … it’s a really sad feeling.”
A vote by the U.S. Senate on whether to re-
peal “don’t ask, don’t tell” is likely in the com-ing weeks. Supporters of the repeal, scram-bling to make the most of their time left in Congress this year, have said they will vote in early December after the release of a Pentagon report on the issue.
But if “don’t ask, don’t tell” isn’t repealed, 
Daniel will still sweat through boot camp, strap on his helmet and get on his plane. And he won’t say a word.8, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2010

By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
While students and fans alike 
enjoyed time off during the holiday 
weekend, the Gators were hard at work. They played three games in five days and spent Thanksgiving 
on the road.
By the time conference play 
begins Jan. 2, Florida will have 
played in four tournaments as part of a plan by coach Amanda Butler to season her inexperienced team.
“You expect a certain level of 
adversity when you go on the road,” Butler said. “It puts a lot of 
pressure on our leaders to make 
sure we’re doing the things that we need to do to get ready. It’s just another way for this team to grow up.”
But Florida (5-1) is back in 
Gainesville and will take on Old 
Dominion (3-1) tonight at 7 in the 
O’Connell Center.  
Butler said Old Dominion, 
which has also faced a challenging opening schedule, will test the re-solve of the young Gators.
ODU recorded wins against 
Georgia Tech, Louisville and North Carolina A&T, and dropped a nar -
row two-point defeat to North Carolina State. 
Led by senior guard Jasmine 
Parker (17.8 points, 4.3 assists and 3.8 steals per game), ODU looks to avenge last season’s 81-67 loss to Florida on its home court.
The Monarchs have three play-
ers averaging double-digit scoring, presenting matchup problems on 
defense for their opposition.
“They’re good, I’ll tell you that. 
They’re really, really good,” But-
ler said. “Old Dominion is one of those teams that, year in and year out, you know if you have them on your schedule that you’re going to have a quality opponent. This Old Dominion team certainly fits that 
description.
“They are very talented, return-
ing almost everyone from last sea-
son. (Coach) Wendy Larry always has her team very well prepared and dangerous in a lot of differ -
ent ways. They have great balance, they’ve got scorers at every spot, they’re athletic and they do a re-
ally good job scoring in transition. 
I could go on and on about them.”
Butler said Florida has been 
concentrating on self-improve-ment to compensate for the lack of preparation time between games.
Home for only a short stint, 
Florida will again take to the road this weekend traveling to Provi-dence, R.I., for the Brown Bear Classic at Brown University . 
“To not have two or three days 
to prepare, but really less than 24 hours, it really tests us mentally , tests our focus and tests our leader -
ship.” Butler said. “And those are all tests we need right now, that we need to respond to, that we need to grow from.
“There really is a limited 
amount of time that you can focus 
on your opponent, so your game 
better be really sharp. What makes us good as a team better be at the forefront of the gameplan.”
Butler said the keys to victory 
include making the most of pos-sessions on the offensive end and getting ODU’s top players out of 
their comfort zones on defense. 
Lately the Gators have had 
trouble knocking down easy at-
tempts in the paint, which has led to poor shot decisions elsewhere. Florida, shooting 38 percent on the season, must execute better offen-
sively to win, Butler said.
TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI POLL RESULTS UF VOLLEYBALLSaj Guevara / Alligator
UF women’s basketball coach Amanda Butler scheduled four reg-
ular-season tournaments to help prepare her team for SEC play.
UF set to host Old Dominion
Some day, you just might thank the ’Noles for that spanking 
they laid on your Gators last weekend.
OK, probably not, but getting smoked at Doak was just 
what Florida needed. 
That ugly 31-7 loss to FSU left the message loud and clear that UF 
has to make changes. 
This was an awful season with few redeeming qualities, and Ur -
ban Meyer repeatedly addressed the need to rebuild the program in his postgame press conference.
If the Gators had beaten a mediocre Seminoles team instead, that 
discussion never happens, and reality doesn’t set in.
There’s paranoia among UF fans that they can see what’s wrong 
with their team but it may not be fixed. If you’re one of those people, this game was your chill pill.
Florida State offered Florida the same opportunity that South 
Carolina did a few weeks ago — win this game, and a terrible sea-son doesn’t look quite as terrible.
By losing both, the Gators didn’t leave much room for analysis. 
There’s no sugarcoating what went down in 2010. They were pretty crappy .Injuries and a lack of playmakers offer up some excuses, but this 7-5 campaign was bad enough that UF can’t try the same for -
mula next year.
Meyer has to take a long, hard look at Steve Addazio and decide 
whether he’s really the man for the job of running Florida’s offense. 
He has to think about his quarterback situ-ation and whether John Brantley can lead a championship team.
He’ll have to evaluate everything from his 
offensive scheme to the way he recruits to his new assistant coaches.
And that’s exactly what you want.Meyer’s track record proves he knows 
what he’s doing, and this situation isn’t go-ing to sit well with him. 
Inside, he has to be seething. Hell, losing 
to Alabama last year almost killed him. Get-ting slapped around by the Tide, two former 
assistants, Steve Spurrier and the Team Out West must make his skin crawl.
It really sunk in after the FSU game, when a reporter mentioned 
that the Gators have lost five of their last eight and a wide-eyed 
Meyer turned to his media relations director and said, “Five out of 
the last eight? Wow.”
If he was more emotional, I would have expected a “You’ll never 
see a coach rebuild a program harder than I will” speech.And think about what he would have said if Florida won its seventh straight against Florida State.
Probably something like: “I’m really proud of our team. They 
stuck together, followed the plan to win and just beat a good football team — I mean a really good football team with some great ath-
letes in an unbelievable environment. Johnny played his heart out 
just like he has all year. Can’t ask for anything more from him. And coach Addazio had that offense really clicking, as usual.”
I’ve seen enough Meyer press conferences to know that wouldn’t 
be far off the mark.
Think about those words and what they would mean for next 
season.Then think about how you felt watching what was essen-tially a meaningless loss in Tallahassee.
Which ending would you choose?
If I were you, I’d pick the one that ends with the Gators getting 
better because they got an ice-cold wake-up call.Loss is perfect end to 
regular season

n TCU WILL MAKE THE MOVE IN 
2012.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
FORT WORTH, Texas — TCU is moving 
to the Big East Conference, where the Horned 
Frogs won’t have to worry about busting the BCS to play for a national championship.
TCU’s board of trustees unanimously 
approved an invitation Monday to join the Big East in football and all other sports. The move from the Mountain West Conference becomes official July 1, 2012.
The Big East will provide TCU automatic 
access to the Bowl Championship Series and its five big-money games. That league, cur -
rently with eight football teams, has one of 
six automatic BCS slots.
TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte said 
gaining automatic-qualifying status “was a 
big factor” in the move and gives the Horned Frogs “the greatest opportunity to compete for the national championship.”
The Big East has schools in nine of the na-
tion’s 35 largest media markets and will soon add Dallas/Fort Worth, the fifth largest.
“Located in one of the top five media 
markets in the country, TCU also enables the Big East to extend its media footprint, which already encompasses more than a quarter of the country,” league commissioner John Marinatto said.
The pending departure of TCU continues 
a big shuffle for the Mountain West, which next season is losing Utah to the expanded Pac-12 and BYU, which is going independent in football. Boise State, another big BCS bust-er, is moving from the WAC to the Mountain 
West along with Fresno State and Nevada.
“Today’s intercollegiate athletics environ-
ment is very fluid,” Mountain West Confer -
ence commissioner Craig Thompson said in 
a statement. “Our board of directors and di-rectors of athletics, as they have throughout the history of the MWC and with even more focus recently, will continue to analyze the landscape and chart our course in the context 
of ongoing changes.”
Thompson said there were “conversations 
already under way with potential future 
members.”
Del Conte said losing BYU and Utah was 
a “significant blow” to the Mountain West.
“It was not the same league that we 
joined,” he said. “It’s not the same home that we bought, it’s not same home we were in-
vited to, and things changed, the landscape 
changed.”
The No. 3 Horned Frogs (12-0) wrapped 
up their second consecutive undefeated reg-ular season and Mountain West title with a 66-17 victory at New Mexico on Saturday.
TCU is third in the BCS standings, the 
highest for a non-automatic qualifying team, and in line for a chance to play for the na-tional championship if Auburn or Oregon lose next weekend. The Frogs likely will play in the Rose Bowl if Auburn and Oregon both win — players were holding roses on the 
field after their win Saturday.
The only current Big East team ranked 
in the AP poll is No. 23 West Virginia (8-3, 
4-2 Big East), which is 24th in the BCS stand-
ings. Connecticut (7-4, 4-2) could get the league’s auto-matic BCS spot with a win against USF.
TCU might not have 
been headed to a BCS game without Boise State’s loss 
Friday night in overtime at Nevada. Had the Broncos remained undefeated, there 
was a real possibility that the Broncos could have passed the Frogs in the BCS standings and been the only non-automatic-qualifying team to get into one of the top-level bowls.
“This is a great move,” coach Gary Patter -
son said. “I’ll say this, we don’t seem to get bored around this place. ... The one last mark people have held against in recruiting is that we were not an automatic qualifier. Now that’s been erased.”
TCU was a BCS buster for the first time 
last season, then lost to Boise State in the Fi-esta Bowl.
The Frogs have won 25 consecutive reg-
ular-season games, and 38 of 41 overall. The only losses in that span were in the Fiesta Bowl, and games at Oklahoma and Utah.
With all TCU sports moving to the Big 
East, it will create a 17-team basketball league.
Marinatto said the league was aware of 
the logistical issues associated with having 17 basketball teams and nine football teams and that those issues would be addressed soon. He wouldn’t discuss the possibility of even more schools being added to the league.
The Big East will be the fourth conference 
for TCU since the Southwest Conference broke apart after the 1995 season.
TCU was in the WAC from 1996-2000 be-
fore going to Conference USA for four sea-sons and then joining the Mountain West in 2005.
When Nebraska announced it was leav-
ing the Big 12 for the Big 10 and Colorado 
declared its move to the Pac-10, the Big 12 
opted against adding TCU or anybody else and plans to move forward as a 10-team league for now.

seven years and reportedly losing defensive line coach Dan McCarney to North Texas, Florida took a hit in re-cruiting Monday.
Asheville (N.C.) High four-star defensive end Jeoffrey 
Pagan decommitted from the Gators.
“I felt like I was missing out on some stuff and wanted 
to get back into everything so I’m not missing out on any-thing,” Pagan told Rivals.com.
Pagan had been orally committed to the Gators since 
April 11. He was the second commitment in UF’s 2011 re-cruiting class.
McCarney, who is expected to be officially named the 
head coach at North Texas today, was responsible for the 
recruitment of Pagan and several other prospects, includ-
ing four-star UF cornerback commit Nick Waisome. The 
6-foot-4, 272-pound Pagan told Rivals that McCarney’s departure played a role in his decision to decommit.
Pagan, the No. 3 strongside defensive 
end in the nation according to Rivals, wavered on his commitment in June. But 
following UF’s annual Friday Night Lights camp in July, 
Pagan said he spoke with coach Urban Meyer and would 
not be taking any official visits during the season out of 
respect for Meyer.
That has changed, though, as Pagan opened it up to 
Clemson, Alabama, LSU, Ohio State, Oregon and South-
ern California.
“Everyone’s in the game now,” Pagan said. “I’m going 
to keep it a secret and decide on signing day.”
Following the loss to Florida State, Meyer emphasized 
recruiting as a remedy following the team’s five-loss reg-ular season.
“Recruit our butt off is what we’re going to do, and that starts (Saturday night),” Meyer said. “Coaches are all on the road (Sunday), so we’re going to recruit our butt off and build this thing back up.”
UF coaches are expected to meet with Pagan today. But 
he isn’t the only four-star defensive end recruit they will 
be going after aggressively.Sunday morning, following the firing of Miami coach 
Randy Shannon, Meyer called Hurricanes commit An-
thony Chickillo, who listed UF among his finalists before choosing to become a third-generation Hurricane. 
McCarney was also responsible for Chickillo’s recruit-
ment, but Meyer told Chickillo he will be taking over his 
recruitment for McCarney.
Oral commitments are non-binding until a national letter of 
intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 2. Pagan backs off oral commitment to Florida

chasing in the race for a playoff spot.

DAVIE — The Miami Dolphins’ most lopsid-
ed win this year did little to help their slim play-
off chances, and coach Tony Sparano knows it.
The Dolphins (6-5) might fall short of a post-
season berth even if they sweep their final five 
games. Odds are long in part because the Dol-
phins have lost to the four teams they’re chas-
ing in the AFC race — the Patriots and Jets (both 9-2) and Ravens and Steelers (both 8-3) — and head-to-head results are the first tiebreaker for a wild-card berth.
All four teams won last week, so Miami 
gained no ground despite a 33-17 victory at Oakland.
“This is back-against-the-wall time,” Sparano 
said Monday. “Winning the game, our margin for error is still the same as it was going in.”
That means it’s small, and Miami desperate-
ly needs a December surge beginning Sunday against Cleveland.
At least the inconsistent Dolphins looked 
like a playoff team against Oakland. They gained 471 yards, their highest total in 15 years, and held the Raiders to 16 yards rushing, which 
matched the second-lowest total ever by a Mi-
ami opponent.
“Our mentality was, ‘Let’s start that tough 
climb,’” running back Ronnie Brown said.
With playoff hopes in jeopardy, the Dol-
phins bounced back from a rash of injuries and a prime-time drubbing by Chicago. They showed plenty of emotion against the Raiders and Sparano led the way, throwing roundhouse 
punches as his team pulled away.
“We spent a lot of time this week talking 
about getting back to having some fun,” he 
said. “Sometimes you’ve got to challenge them a little bit that way, and I did that toward the end of the week and said, ‘Listen, there’s no law 
that says that these college guys are the only 
people that can have fun, and that when you graduate from college to the NFL, the fun meter runs out.’ “
It’s fun to play well, and the Dolphins did 
that. They achieved season highs in points, yards rushing (186) and time of possession 
(41:38), while the defense had three takeaways 
and allowed only one touchdown.
A long list of surprising contributors includ-
ed reserve receivers Marlon Moore and Roberto Wallace, and backup linebackers Tim Dobbins 
and Ikaika Alama-Francis.
“At this stage of the game, when you’re here 
in December now, the more people that you can 
get involved, the better,” Sparano said. “I told the team earlier in the week, ‘When you’re try-ing to get something done, sometimes you need fewer architects and more bricklayers.’ In this game we had a lot of that.”
One architect, leading receiver Brandon Mar -
shall, didn’t play because of a hamstring injury, and leading tackler Karlos Dansby was limited because of a wrist injury. Their status for the Browns game is uncertain.
For the first time in a month, Sparano will 
start the same quarterback two games in a row. Chad Henne’s grip on the job became firmer with a 307-yard, two-touchdown passing per -
formance at Oakland.
The start was Henne’s first since a bizarre 
sequence that turned the position into a revolving door. Henne was benched, then regained the job when 
Chad Pennington suffered a season-
ending shoulder injury. Henne then hurt his left knee and missed the 
game against the Bears.
“He didn’t put his head in the sand here 
through this whole thing, which I knew he wouldn’t do,” Sparano said. “He’s not that type of kid.”
Resilience has been a pattern this season for 
Miami, with the past four victories coming after a defeat. But the Dolphins haven’t strung to-gether consecutive wins since they were 2-0.
“They just kind of won’t go away,” Sparano 
said. “They stay together even when it gets re-ally hard. Their focus and concentration and work ethic in practice all stay the same, so my hat’s off to them. They do a good job that way; 
now we got to find a way to do it two weeks in 
a row.”Dolphins face slim playoff chances despite win
