Students who plan to drive home for 
Thanksgiving may see a pleasant sur-
prise when they pull up to the pump.
Gainesville’s gas prices deceased 
this month and are expected to con-tinue to fall through the Christmas sea-son.
Gas prices in Florida fell from a 
$3.70 average last month to $3.43, said Gregg Laskoski, senior petroleum ana-lyst for GasBuddy.com.
At this time last year, the average 
was $3.40. 
Florida AAA spokeswoman Jessica Brady said prices are expected to con-tinue to fall through Thanksgiving and possibly through the end of the year.
“There is a rally in the market cen-
tered around optimism,” Brady said.
Gas prices follow the oil ﬂ  uctuation. 
According to Brady, there was a recent national decrease in the demand for both.The most expensive regular-grade 
gas in Gainesville is $3.69 at the Chev-ron at 3328 W. University Ave., Lasko-ski said.
The cheapest regular-grade gas in 
the city is $3.29 at the BP near the in-tersection of Southwest Williston Road and Interstate 75, according to the gas prices website.
Christine Hoffman, a 20-year-old 
UF economics junior, said driving home from Gainesville can get expen-sive if gas prices are high.
“Driving back home is horrible,” she 
said. “You have to force your friends to ride with you to split the cost of gas.”

Three people have come down with the West 
Nile virus in Alachua County.
The Alachua County Health Department an-
nounced Tuesday it will conduct investigations of 
the cases. It did not release the conditions of the people sick with the virus.
West Nile appeared in the county in September 
when two chickens tested positive for the disease. Later that month, the department announced more fowl and a horse had the virus, too.
As of Nov. 6, 58 cases of West Nile occurred 
in Florida, causing two deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nationwide, there have been 5,054 cases and 228 deaths.
Alachua County still has a mosquito-borne ill-
ness advisory.
The county health department urges residents 
to stay calm but to be prepared. It encourages resi-dents to cover up with bug spray and long sleeves and to drain standing water.
Symptoms of the virus include fever, headaches, 
fatigue, rashes and swollen lymph nodes, accord-ing to the CDC.
“Although cooler weather has reduced mos-
quito activity, the risk of disease transmission to humans continues,” Paul Myers, Alachua County Health Department administrator, said in a press release.  “Citizens are encouraged to protect them-selves against exposure to mosquitoes.”

At his State of the Campus address 
Tuesday, Student Body President Tj Vil-
lamil said he’s working to represent stu-dents’ demands to the state to curb tuition increase.
About 250 students attended the ad-
dress, during which Villamil discussed the Aim Higher initiative, which he said started at UF in Spring 2012.
After his speech, Villamil said the soft 
launch will start with an outreach and a social media campaign. 
The hard launch will be in December 
when he goes to Tallahassee to persuade state representatives to increase funding for higher education.He said the ultimate 
goal is to not increase tuition for the Spring se-mester.  
He also discussed UF’s 
search for a new presi-
dent. Villamil is the only student member of the Presidential Search Com-mittee.
“The president of this university should 
make sure he connects with all of you as students,” he said. 
He asked students with feedback or 
questions regarding the presidential search to contact him or other Student Govern-ment ofﬁ  cials.

A small crowd gathered around 
visiting professor Ulisses Rocha 
and his guitar Tuesday morning in the Hub.
Rocha, a 51-year-old Bacardi 
Family Eminent Scholar at the Center for Latin American Studies in collaboration with the School of Music, performed traditional Bra-zilian music to kick off Internation-al Education Week.
“The international education is 
important because [it] creates the basis for information and culture exchange, the most short way to a rich and peaceful life,” Rocha wrote in an email.
The United States departments 
of State and Education organize International Education Week to celebrate the exchange of educa-tion and ideas. The week ofﬁ  cially ends Friday, but campus events last until Sunday.
“It is an attempt to raise up 
international education at uni-versities across the country,” said David Sammons, dean of the UF International Center.This year’s theme is “Picture 
Yourself Connecting with the World!”
Academic centers participated 
more this year, Sammons said. 
Nearly every col-
lege on campus is involved with International Ed-ucation Week.
T u e s d a y ’ s 
events included the VISA World Fair on the Re-
itz Union Colonnade, the annual Global Photo Reception Competi-tion and the International Educa-tor of the Year Ceremony.
This year’s winners of the In-
ternational Educator awards were Florin Curta in the senior faculty category, Richard Rheingans in the junior faculty category and Joe Rojo in the staff category.
“We all have a place in the inter-
national arena, whether we leave the state or not,” Sammons said.
New events this year include 
short ﬁ  lms shown by the Center for European Studies, academic dis-cussions on languages and events like Arabic Name Writing.Students can also get a taste 
of different cultures at the dining halls. 
Asian, Mediterranean and Ca-
ribbean cuisine will be served throughout the week.
About 5,000 students and 2,000 
scholars and faculty from about 100 countries study or work at UF, and about 2,000 UF students study abroad.
“As a Brazilian, I know that the 
culture mixing brings positive val-ues in terms of coexistence, respect and fellowship,” Rocha said. “This is what’s really important.”

UF will host a book discussion about 
slavery and race relations today.
The discussion, sponsored by UF’s 
Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, 
is hosted by Larry Rivers, president of Fort Valley State University. He will discuss his book, “Rebels and Run-aways: Slave Resistance in Nineteenth-Century Florida.”
The event will be at 6 p.m. in Pugh 
Hall and is free.
Tamarra Jenkins, a program assis-
tant for the oral history program, said she thinks students might be interested in the talk due to recent events dealing with race at UF, like when two Beta Theta Pi brothers dressed in blackface at a social Oct. 24.
“We believe it’s really going to be 
able to resonate pretty soundly and hit close to home for students,” Jenkins said.
She said the event is open to the 
public, and the center expects about 300 people to attend.
UF history professor Steven Noll is 
offering extra credit to students who go. He said he thinks it’s important for students to learn more about slavery.
“It’s good for them to get a different 
perspective on history,” he said.
Noll said he thinks UF students 
should make an effort to attend intel-lectual events, which sometimes don’t receive much attention on campus.
“This university isn’t just about go-
ing to see Tracy Morgan … and coun-try music,” he said. “It’s about going to see something that may cause you to think differently.”Slavery discussion today�TOGETHER THEY LOST

There is a lot less to Luis and 
Jorge Garit than there used to be, 
and they’re OK with that.
What makes them stand out 
isn’t their boisterous personalities or nearly identical faces, although they’re certainly attention grabbers. The boys lost almost half their total body weight in one year.
Luis and Jorge Garit, both 
18-year-old civil engineering fresh-men, are fraternal twins who were born in Havana, Cuba.
They were almost like all the oth-
er little boys their age, except they each weighed about 100 pounds more.
At about 6 years old, they flew to 
the United States and started a new life in Miami. At 7 years old, the twins started to gain weight.
“I never ate unhealthy ,” Luis 
Garit said. “I just ate a lot.”
As the twins started second 
grade, they said, they began to no-tice they were larger than most of their classmates.
“I wasn’t the only fat kid then,” 
Jorge Garit said, with a smile. “An-other kid weighed 130 pounds, so I felt good.”
To the brothers, everything in 
America was new, and there were many different kinds of food to try.
“My parents would just buy 
food … chips, desserts and soda,” Luis Garit said. “My brother and I would eat a family-sized cereal in two days.” 
By the time they were 15 years old, the brothers each weighed more than 230 pounds. Not long after, a doctor told them they suffered from high cholesterol levels and high blood pressures. 
“It was September 17, 2010,” 
Jorge Garit said, “I still remember the exact day.”
The boys had two options, the 
doctor said: Start taking medication or lose weight.
“I didn’t have low self-esteem 
when I was fat. I just had to live with it,” Jorge Garit said. “I felt ashamed, and I still do — ashamed that I let myself become that.”
Their mom started to cook with-
out salt and bought a treadmill for the twins to jog 30 minutes a day . They were lucky if their mom al-lowed them to eat a cup of beans once a week.
Every Wednesday and Saturday , 
they stepped on a scale to see how much progress they made.
“It was worth it to weigh myself 
and see that one to two pounds were gone,” Luis Garit said.
The twins went from size 42 
waists to size 30. Shirt sizes dropped from extra-extra-larges to smalls.
Now, they watch their calorie 
intakes and eat smaller portions. During their journey, the twins said, they realized the weight loss didn’t just change their physical appear -
ances; it changed how they viewed themselves.
“I felt like they still saw me as 
the fat kid,” Luis Garit said, sighing. “Even though I lost all the weight, I was still the one fat kid in their eyes.”
Although they occasionally still 
struggle with how they view them-selves, the twins said they know they’ve made the right decision. 
They both keep thumb-size pic-
tures of their former selves in their wallets to remind them never to go back to how they used to be.
“It feels great to go shopping and 
actually find clothes your size,” Luis Garit said. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Graphic photos and stories about neglect-
ed and abused dogs and cats in Puerto Rico 
were displayed Tuesday on Turlington Plaza as part of UF’s Puerto Rican Student Associa-tion’s exhibit.
Organization President Carlos Lloveras-
Fuentes wore an “I love Satos” shirt, which translates to “I love street dogs,” as he told people about the conditions in which many stray animals live.“Over 500,000 stray pets roam the streets of 
the island,” the 21-year-old animal science se-nior said. “The grassroots companies that take the animals barely have any room and money for them.”
He said the organization’s goal is to edu-
cate people in Gainesville and motivate them to donate money to the few shelters and ani-mal rescue organizations on the island.
Lloveras-Fuentes said he was hesitant to 
launch the exhibit at first, because he wasn’t sure people in Gainesville would help.
“I realized dogs don’t have a voice, or race or political affiliation,” he said. “They need a voice and need someone to speak out for them.”
Rachel Werk, a 19-year-old English sopho-
more, said she couldn’t help but glance at the photos as she passed through Turlington.
“They’re so graphic, and it’s so sad to really look at the pictures,” she said. “I had no idea this issue was so large-scale in Puerto Rico.”
Lloveras-Fuentes said he sees stray dogs 
hurt, unhealthy and skinny in the streets when he goes to Puerto Rico, his home.
“Litters of dogs with moms walk on the 
side of the roads, and I’ve seen dogs running scared in between cars on the highways,” he said. “We will make it our priority to educate and raise awareness of the issue.”
The exhibition will be on display again 
today on Turlington Plaza and Thursday out-side the Reitz Union.

It’s been a pretty good week for you if you like petitions.
Or if you detest Donald Trump. Or if you live in Texas but 
don’t want to be a part of the “union” anymore.
There’s a pretty strong petition making its way through the 
Internet, as petitions are wont to do, to get Donald Trump ﬁ  red 
from his role with Macy’s.
Imagine that — ﬁ  ring Trump. Even Cher is on board with 
the idea.
“I’ll never go to Macy’s again! I didn’t know they sold Don-
ald Trump’s line! If they don’t care that they sell products from a loudmouth racist cretin, who’d lie like ‘his rug’ to get some cheap press! I can’t believe Macy’s thinks he’s the right ‘man’ 2 represent their name!” she said, in a series of tweets, according to a San Francisco Gate blog.
The petition “aims to convince store chiefs to distance them-
selves from Trump over his recent criticism of newly re-elected President Barack Obama” and his “racially charged birther con-spiracy.”
You mean to imply that Trump criticized Obama with very 
racist undertones? This is shocking and new information! 
We would think that businesses who choose to work with 
him know what they’re getting themselves into. It’s kind of weird that a company as wholesome as Macy’s wouldn’t simply outright ignore the crazy things he says.
It probably pretends that he’s not as racist as he is because he 
makes it a lot of money. Cool. Good standards, America.
More than 350,000 people signed the petition so far. That’s 
less than the amount of people who want Texas to secede.
As of Tuesday morning, the petition had about 60,000 sig-
natures. Texas is, surprisingly, only one of 30 states that ﬁ  led secession petitions through the “We The People” program on the White House website.
Even though a Texas GOP ofﬁ  cial “called for an ‘amicable di-
vorce’ from the United States last week,” according to the Huff-ington Post, it doesn’t look like the state will leave. Also, Gov. Rick Perry made it clear that he doesn’t support the idea, despite false rumors that claim he used to advocate for it.
For a petition to receive a response from the White House, 
it must get at least 20,000 signatures within 30 days. Texas and Louisiana met the quota, and Florida recently crossed it as well. Is that really what people want? To just leave the country to do what, exactly? Try to survive as individual countries, we sup-pose.  It seems impossible that people are signing these petitions with real intent, because there is no way any one of these states would make it on its own.
Can you imagine what the United States of Florida would 
look like? A terrible wasteland of abandoned strip malls and tourist traps with some kind of animal as the president. Prob-ably an alligator. Or Mickey Mouse. Or maybe Donald Trump would do it.
If so many people are unhappy with the ties Trump has with-
in this country , then we should probably give him a small place to rule where he can be as racist as he pleases.
Someone start that petition.Moralism is not the root of Christianity
Last week, I accompanied my roommate to CVS phar-
macy. He needed to reﬁ  ll a prescription, and I was try-ing to avert a minor catastrophe by replacing some lost 
lip balm. No one likes crusty lips, and mine get so dry , they can spark brush ﬁ  res if I’m not careful.
At the cashier’s suggestion, I swiped my roommate’s CVS 
card, netting him some get-out-of-sick-free points for the next time he felt like vomiting. “Next time” came sooner than ex-pected, though, and we qualiﬁ  ed for 20 percent off a ﬂ  u shot. He offered it to me, but I had only planned to vaccinate my lips to avoid judgment by all the pretty people.
I didn’t end up getting my arm numbed for the rest of the 
day , but my trip left me waxing philosophical.  
Shots are the modern medical marvel — the veritable cure 
in a syringe. Inoculations weaken the infectious agent and strip it of its virulent potency to allow the body to build up immunity to a dud. No matter how strong it is down the road, the host is essentially “cured” because the body remembers the dud and can immediately reject and ﬁ  ght it.
Don’t you love how easy it is to draw spiritual parallels 
from the natural world?  
We’ve been inoculated. Something extraordinary dropped 
in our laps, and we reject it based on a weak substitute we en-countered before.  
In case you were wondering, I’m talking about Jesus. It’s, 
like, my thing.
To be clear, Jesus’ end game isn’t to violently kill us like 
some form of ebola, but the analogy is useful to paint a word picture.  
Morals are a good road map to lead us in the right direc-
tion, but moralism wasn’t Jesus’ message. He treated moral-ity like branches that needed to be trimmed; he went straight for the root (or heart) of the problem. His words and his prin-ciples meant to show us our need for God, not to become the thing that we worship in and of itself.    
Isn’t that what happened, though?  Christians became experts at lecturing gays on the virtues and sacredness of marriage while we sleep around en masse and di-vorce each other at the same rate as non-Christians.  
Sermons admonish people to 
“clean up” their behaviors, do good deeds and be good.  It’s a wonderful sentiment, but it’s just not biblical.  
Feel free to fact check me.It’s no wonder many of us think matters of spirituality 
come down to which sports team you grew up liking.  
Christian moralism is a weak, attenuated spirituality com-
pared to the potency of Jesus. I’d reject that crap, too.
Forcing a bunch of dying people to eat more healthily 
when they have a tumor growing inside them is pointless. Trying a lot won’t cut it. Jesus didn’t come to simply give a moral code.  He came to write a new reality on our hearts.
We’ve missed the point by accepting the dud. Rules can re-
strain one’s actions, but only grace can transform the heart.
Christianity is not about attaining personal happiness, 
doing good things or being more moral than people around us. It cannot be summarized by gold-plated cruciﬁ  xes and tacky jewelry from our religious yesterdays.
Jesus came to revolutionize our roots. He took the death 
penalty so everyone who stood condemned could have his life.
The way of Jesus is not only an ongoing story of super-
natural discipline, but also one of divine adoption. Friends, God is not looking for adherents. He’s looking for sons and daughters, and he’s calling our names.
I can’t say I blame the disillusioned and incensed masses 
for rejecting the impotence of institutionalized Christianity. It’s lame.
Perhaps it’s time to actually try Jesus.Ryan Galloway is a religion senior at UF. His column appears

The American people made a choice Nov. 6 that will 
dictate the direction of public policy for at least the next four years. 
But that doesn’t mean our job is over.During their campaigns, neither Obama nor Mitt 
Romney adequately addressed the most pressing prob-lem facing our country: the national debt. 
Whether this issue is addressed in the coming years 
will determine the United States’ viability as a world power in the 21st century and, with it, the legacy of our generation.
It’s perfectly understandable why the candidates 
wouldn’t suggest serious reform during the campaign season — to do so would have been electoral suicide. 
But as of Nov. 6, Obama secured his position in the 
Oval Ofﬁ  ce. It’s time to let him hear our voices.
For far too long, Congress has kicked its $16 trillion 
can down the road, running up a dizzying tab for future generations — yeah, that’s us — to pay off.
Both Democrats and Republicans will have to com-
mit to entitlement program reform, tax reform and a leaner, more efﬁ  cient military.
If the debt is allowed to grow at its current rate, it 
will cripple the ability of our proud nation to exercise its most basic roles: protecting and providing for its citi-zens. 
Sound frightening? That’s because it is.These are the facts: Our national debt has surpassed 
$16 trillion, and every day it grows by an average of $4 billion. 
In 2011, the deﬁ  cit exceeded the annual GDP level 
for the ﬁ  rst time in U.S. history.
Some deﬁ  cit spending is widely accepted by econo-
mists as a method of national economic recovery, espe-cially during a recession. 
But with the working population shrinking every 
day and no effort on the part of politicians to scale back spending, this is quickly developing into a crisis.
If this crisis continues, we will not only lose the trust 
of other governments but also face a lack of funding for national programs that we now take for granted.
Think about this: By 2033, the government will only 
be able to pay out 75 percent of promised Social Secu-rity beneﬁ  ts.
The choice future leaders will inevitably have to 
make is either to ﬁ  nance the debt or to provide for the people. The fact that our generation’s 
future hangs in the balance clear-ly demonstrates that both parties will have to work together to ﬁ  nd a solution that beneﬁ  ts the Amer-ican public.
Now, this isn’t one of the hy-
perbolic hypotheticals thrown around by self-styled deﬁ  cit hawks in campaign ads.
The Chinese government isn’t going to call in all 
their loans tomorrow, and anyone who tells you other-wise is insulting your intelligence. 
However, that doesn’t mean our ballooning debt is 
acceptable. 
The time will come when the U.S is forced to look 
itself in the mirror and make some serious changes to remain a viable state.
If things continue as they are, the moment will come 
when our generation is faced with challenges that are unfathomably difﬁ  cult, if not impossible.
So start the process now.As young voters, we have seen the debt skyrocket in 
our lifetimes, and it is our chance to make this transi-tion.
So let us continue to pave a path that will improve 
the standing of our economy for generations to come. 
Let us not sit back and allow the debt to rise without 
limit; let us ask for the media, the people and the politi-cians to think with us to make our futures a priority.
This is a call to thoughtful action, a chance to am-
plify our voices. 
Call your representative. Write to your president.Sign the petition for The Can Kicks Back campaign, 
which seeks to highlight these concerns on Capitol Hill and create a long-term deﬁ  cit reduction agreement in 2013. 
Force those who dug us into this $16 trillion hole to 
lay the foundations for a way out.
The legacy of our generation should involve lifting 
this country to greater heights than ever, not ﬂ  ailing to keep the nation’s head above the rising tide of irrespon-sible spending.
We deserve better than that. We’re capable of better than that. It’s time for the can 
to kick back.

Former Massachusetts Gov . 
Mitt Romney’s loss to President Barack Obama 
put the Republican Party at a crossroads on a national scale. During the 2012 campaign, the GOP struggled to remain intact and keep a uniﬁ  ed message. While Romney attempted to keep the focus on the economy and jobs, the prevalence of controversial social issues on the national scene exposed weakness in his campaign and in the vision of the party.
Attacks by both sides demonized the opposition, mak-
ing it unequivocally difﬁ  cult to heal a tense and worried America following a presidential campaign.
The lack of a unifying message from Republicans made 
it relatively easy and effective for President Obama’s cam-paign team to deﬁ  ne him by attacking Romney’s success in business and portraying him as out of touch with the majority of Americans. Romney is criticized in a similar way because he allowed others to portray the president as an out-of-touch socialist who is not of American descent.  
We need only to look to Florida for a prime focus of a 
fractured GOP .
Despite being out of the campaign picture, Gov. Rick 
Scott’s afﬁ  rmation that Florida’s economy is on the rise directly contradicted Romney’s main argument that the economy has stagnated at best and that a new direction is required. These contrasting arguments only undermined the efforts of the GOP to complete a viable campaign.
Refusing to adjust to a new American electorate, Rom-
ney’s nomination appealed to a version of America that does not take into account the growing inﬂ  uence of mi-norities. Despite being a decent candidate, enthusiasm for his candidacy never took off.
The majority of voters seemed to vote either for or 
against President Obama; people who were against him settled for Romney. The Obama campaign thrived in this regard and ran a highly effective campaign that looked to America’s future. To be highly effective going forward, the Republican Party must use this defeat to redeﬁ  ne itself and appeal to a wider range of voters.
Beginning with the primary process, the GOP failed 
to present a winning strategy in 2012. The party relied on past strategies that, unfortunately for Republicans, do not apply anymore.
Party leaders should cede their statuses to a younger 
generation that is more in touch with the issues of the day. This process starts now.
Despite being viewed as the main culprits for arguably 
the most unproductive Congress in American history, Re-publicans can start a new chapter rebranding their image by working with the president and compromising with him. This option can no longer be taboo and is absolutely necessary for the country to avoid reaching and to over-come the ﬁ  scal cliff.
As we grow up, we come to understand the thrill of 
winning. 
There is no greater feeling than competing, winning 
and hoisting the trophy after victory . 
With respect to our party politics, we must overcome 
this sensation.
If we maintain this state, we will reach the ﬁ  scal cliff 
and fall off it, leaving the majority of the American public with a long-lasting sense of ﬁ  nancial uncertainty .  
The state of affairs is no longer sustainable. We will 
be victorious only if we are willing to hoist the trophy to-gether.
Compromise is key , and for our issues to be resolved, 
we must have two strong political parties open to self-evaluation and are willing to provide an outstretched arm instead of a pointed ﬁ  nger or a clenched ﬁ  st.

opinions@alligator.orgVillamil said that as a member of the Board of 
Trustees, he was a part of the decision to increase 
UF tuition by 9 percent instead of the 15 percent other universities adopted.
“We are getting a bargain unlike any other,” he 
said.
Other initiatives SG accomplished include a Mo-
bile Deal Launch. Students can text “UF” to 96714 to receive notifications about discounts.
He said it cost nothing: Marlimar, an interactive 
mobile strategies company, does all the work by get-ting in contact with the companies for discounts.
After the meeting, Jenna Goldman, the new pres-
ident of the Students Party, said she is disappointed with Villamil’s address. Villamil focused more on logos and the rebrand-
ing of SG cabinets than on recognizing the progress it made in the past year, she said.
Goldman also said he didn’t mention bipartisan-
ship, and he misled students about the SG budget, which Villamil said is about $5 million.
During his speech, Villamil said he wanted to 
clear up ideas about the misconceptions about the SG budget.
SG is in charge of managing the money collected 
from students’ activity and service fees. 
When the funds are collected, they total about 
$18 million, according to the SG website. 
SG gets about $5 million of it and allocates the 
rest to the Reitz Union and the Department of Rec-reational Sports.

Alex Plattner is 22 years 
old, and he saved a life.
The UF mathematics and 
biochemistry senior do-
nated his bone marrow to a 52-year-old stranger who suffered from myelodysplas-tic syndrome, or preleuke-mia, which can weaken the immune system and lower blood cell counts.
“It’s very rare to have the 
chance to directly save some-one’s life like that,” Plattner said. “It’s just a special bond that you create when you do something like this.”
Plattner is a shift leader 
in the third annual SWAB-2SAVE Bone Marrow Donor Registration Drive  run by Shands at UF’s Footprints Buddy and Support Pro-gram. The drive was from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m on the Plaza of the Americas, the Reitz Union Colonnade and at Shands Atrium on Tues-day and continues today. It’s part of a greater effort by the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation to add bone mar -
row donors to an internation-al registry.
This year, Footprints 
plans to match last year’s registrations, which totaled about 1,000 registrations on UF’s campus, said Angelique Boutzoukas, a 20-year-old in-terdisciplinary studies junior for basic biological and medi-cal sciences and coordinator for the drive.
Throughout the last three 
years, drives at UF have add-ed more than 2,600 potential donors to the registry, and of those, 19 have matched peo-ple suffering from a variety of blood cancers.
The chance of being a 
match is 1 in 1,000, which is how the numerical goal of the drive is determined, Boutzoukas said.
Volunteers for the drive, 
about 150 of whom come from a variety of UF orga-nizations, perform a mouth swab test on potential do-nors to collect their DNA, she said. They send those swabs to be tested in laboratories, and matches are contacted for further testing to ensure the donor is a perfect match.
Boutzoukas said people 
often have misconceptions about the donation proce-dure.
“It’s a lot easier to save 
someone’s life than you might think,” Boutzoukas said.
For Dana Marra, a 23-year-
old English junior and po-tential donor who signed up Tuesday, the opportunity to help others overcomes her fear of the procedure.
“I am afraid to do it,” she 
said, “but the people who need it are probably more afraid than I am.”Third annual bone

� THE TASK FORCE MET 
TUESDAY.
SHELBY WEBB
Alligator Staff Writer
A state task force will make 
recommendations this week for 
a controversial self-defense law, which became the center of a na-tional firestorm after the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
The panel may call for a 
change in Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, which gives people the right to use deadly force in self-defense if they are attacked in a public place or their homes.
The group, created by Gov. 
Rick Scott and headed by Flori-da Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, met Tuesday in Pensacola to hear statements from the public and review a nearly finalized list of suggestions for the state.
Some, including the UF Levin 
College of Law’s Criminal Justice Center, feel the task force has been too hasty with its decisions.
“The Criminal Justice Center 
wanted the task force to study the data longer,” said Michelle Jacobs, a UF law professor. “They wanted them to do a more in-depth study so we could really understand what the numbers are saying.”
Jacobs said some of the data 
the panel reviewed isn’t a clear representation of what is happen-ing across the state. For example, she said, different words are used by different police departments to convey the same meaning.
For the past several months, 
the task force has heard from ex-perts in investigations, prosecu-tion, legal defense, neighborhood watch, private security, data anal-ysis and civil rights. The group has also heard public comments. 
Though a finalized list of rec-
ommendations will be released later this week, Jacobs said she doubts the task force will ad-vise the state to make any seri-ous changes to the Stand Your Ground law.
“I would be shocked if some-
thing dramatic came out of it,” Jacobs said. “But you never know. This has been a surprising year.”

SAFETY TIPS
Information reprinted with permission from UF's Off Campus LifeGainesville has an abundance of 
off campus housing options including 
apartments, condos, houses and rooms for rent, so take your time and be sure to visit several properties in person and shop around before signing a lease. We recommend you follow these tips below for finding the right place off campus:
Use the Off Campus Housing 
Locator Service at http://housing.off-campus.ufl.edu. 
Know your budget and choose a 
property that allows you to live within your means.
Create a priority list. What do 
you care about most in a living space? Room size, rent, type of lease, type of community (large undergrad popula-tion, graduate students, local residents, etc.), location, proximity to campus or bus route…all these things are factors to consider in choosing a place to live. Write out a list of ideal characteristics you want in your future living space and keep these criteria in mind when select-ing a location.
Choose a well-suited roommate 
or choose to live alone. Know what kind of person would best compliment your personality and choose accord-ingly.
Drive around and visit the place 
and neighborhood you are looking to live in. Take a tour of the complexes or 
houses that interest you, ask questions, and get to know the complex manage-ment or rental house landlord.
Ask your friends for advice on 
where to live. Which properties worked well for them? Which did not?
Visit the Gainesville Police De-
partment website www.gainesvillepd.org and click on the Crime Reports link to view crime statistics before signing a lease. Enter the address you’re interest-ed in and all reported crime incidents will appear on an interactive map. 
Go back to the property at night 
and make some observations. Is it well lit? Do you see the security guard that management promised? Is the security gate working? Is it quiet enough to study and sleep? How close is the bus stop or parking spot to the complex or house, etc.?
Once you’ve narrowed down your 
search, make an appointment with 
UF’s Student Legal Services by going to their website www.studentlegalservices.ufl.edu and completing the Client Intake Form. SLS can help you in reviewing the lease BEFORE you sign it. This is a great way to know what your legal responsi-bilities will be under that lease. 
Gainesville is a GREAT place 
to rent and live so have fun with your search.
WHAT IS OFF CAMPUS LIFE?
Both personal and property safety is 
important as you search for off-campus 
housing. 
Before signing a lease, Off Campus 
Life recommends you check the crime stats of an area. 
A free service called Crime Reports 
is available on the Gainesville Police Department’s website. Crime Reports allows you to see all reported crime in a certain area. 
Go to www.gainesvillepd.org, click 
“Crime Reports” on the right-hand side, and enter the address of interest to see local incident data.
The following five tips are important 
to use when looking at safety during your apartment search:
1. Go back to the complex at night. 
How do you feel? Is the place well lit and populated, or dark and isolated?
2. Does the property have working 
security gates and/or guards?
3. Check for deadbolts on the out-
side door, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, etc. and ask lots of ques-tions about the security. Is there an extra charge for a security system?
4. Has there been crime in the area 
recently? What actions have been done to prevent crime from happening?
5. Don’t forget about purchasing 
Renter’s Insurance to protect you and your stuff from the unexpected.SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION10, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012

RENTER'S INSURANCELEASE CLAUSES TO LOOK FOR
LEASE CLAUSES TO AVOIDBEFORE 
YOU SIGNMake sure you read and fully understand all 
aspects of the lease before signing. A lease is 
a contract between you and your landlord that spells out specific details of your living arrange-ment. 
Leases often involve policies about pets, secu-
rity and pet deposits, legal entry and other impor-tant information. 
Typically, leases in Gainesville are 12 months. 
If you will need housing for 10 months or less, talk with the management about whether they can provide a short-term lease. 
There are two types of leases that are usually 
available, Joint Leases and Individual Leases.Joint Lease: All roommates are held respon-
sible for the lease. If one person breaks the lease, the other roommates are held responsible for paying the total rent. This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single-family dwelling.
Individual Lease: Each person is held re-
sponsible for his or her own actions. For instance, if one roommate breaks the lease, that person is still responsible for paying his or her own rent. For most college students, individual leases are the best choice. Each person in the lease is re-sponsible for his or her own actions and not the actions of a roommate.
If you are thinking about rent-
ing a house or apartment, Renter’s Insurance provides important cov-erage for both you and your pos-sessions. 
A standard Renter’s Policy pro-
tects your personal property in case of theft or damage and may pay for temporary living expenses if your rental is damaged (including loss of use). It can also shield you from personal liability. 
Anyone who leases a house or 
apartment should consider this type of coverage. 
Talk with your parents before 
getting your own renter’s policy. 
If you are still financially depen-
dent on your parents or a family member and they own a home, they might be able to cover you un-der their homeowner’s policy. 
Some homeowner policies will 
cover a dependent’s rental property while in college. 
There are several types of Resi-
dential Insurance policies. Read your policy information carefully and ensure you have full coverage. 
Floods, earthquakes, sinkholes 
and hurricanes aren't on the list.
 If you live in an area prone to 
one or more of the four, you'll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. 
In areas where hurricanes can 
pose a threat, you might also need to buy a separate rider to cover wind damage. 
Ask your insurance agent about 
this extra coverage.
Gainesville is prone to hurri-
canes and some areas flood.
Policies should include coverage for the following 
items: 
• Fire or lightning  • Windstorm or hail
• Explosion   • Aircraft
• Vehicles   • Smoke 
• Theft 
• Vandalism or malicious mischief • Damage by glass or safety-glazing material that 
is part of a building 
• Falling objects• Water-related damage from home utilities • Electrical surge damage

da resource available to full-
time students is Student Legal Services. 
For any questions on your 
lease, visit the Student Legal Services website: www.stu-dentlegalservices.ufl.edu and set up an appointment with a lawyer to help review it BE-FORE you sign it.

 SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTIONHaving a roommate is a great way 
to divide the cost of living off campus. 
However if you don’t find the right per-son to live with, living off campus could be challenging. Below are some tips that will help those who are thinking about living with a roommate.
Communication is key. Talk about 
your budget for housing, expectations for safety, expectations for guests and what your housing needs are before you even begin your search. Being on the same page as your roommates will make your co-habitation experience much better and reduce the possibility of conflict. 
Start with a friend or sibling. These 
are often good options for roommates since you already know them.
Before moving in, come to an agree-
ment about who will get which bedroom and bathroom along with which cabinets/storage space each person can use.
Discuss how payment of rent and bills will take place. Is each person responsi-ble for his or her own bills or will some-one be in charge of collecting payment from each roommate?
Don’t have someone you want to live 
with? Some apartment complexes offer “Roommate Matching” or “Roommate Placement.”
Roommate Matching: You fill out 
a survey and management attempts to match you with like-minded roommates based on the form.
Roommate Placement: Apartment 
management places you in any open space they have available.
Make sure you can change apart-
ments if management places you with roommates you are not compatible with.
Off Campus Life’s Housing Locator 
http://housing.offcampus.ufl.edu has a NEW roommate finder feature where you can search for roommates.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , 13
You can’t find the right place 
to live until you know how much you are able to spend. Here are some budget questions you should think about while tour-ing a property:
What is the cost of month-
ly rent?
What’s included in that 
rent? Utilities, gas, water, ca-
ble, Internet?
What’s not included in 
rent? 
What is the average 
monthly cost for gas, elec-tric, water and garbage dis-posal? If management doesn’t 
know, contact GRU at www.gru.com and they can provide av-erage costs of utilities from the previous year.
Want to have a pet? Factor 
in the deposit and monthly cost for food, medical and grooming care.Don’t forget the insur-
ance. Before you sign your 
lease, call your insurance com-pany and see how much it will cost monthly to insure your apartment or house.
Are you going to need fuel 
for your vehicle or are you going to use the bus? Fac-tor in transportation/car mainte-nance costs to your budget.
How much will you spend 
monthly on groceries or on a meal plan?
Have some fun! Don’t 
spend so much on rent that you don’t have money for leisure time.
What do you spend on 
clothing, shoes and acces-sories? 
How much money can you 
save every month? It’s really good to save some money ev-ery month to cover unexpected emergency expenses. Even $20 a month saved is good. Every little bit counts.
To help you with your budget, 
OCL has a budget spreadsheet in 
the Gator Guide to Off Campus Life (page 5) and online at www.offcampus.ufl.edu/gator_guide. 
Your living environment plays 
a major role in your overall happiness level and wellbeing. Know what you want to get out of your living space and choose your location and roommate(s) accordingly. Now that you call Gainesville home, let Off Cam-pus Life help you get the most out of your off-campus experience.

 SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTIONWhen you take occupancy of the 
apartment, complete a thorough 
written inventory of the apartment’s condition and have the landlord or an impartial witness sign the invento-ry. Make sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect you from the landlord claiming you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the 
apartment completely and thorough-ly. Some landlords provide a check-list outlining the cleaning they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts for cleaning supplies and professional carpet cleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the land-
lord to inspect the apartment with you. Complete a move-out checklist and make sure the landlord signs and dates it. Use an impartial wit-ness if the landlord is not available or refuses your request. Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are strongly recommended in case there is a dispute.
• First, last and always, PAY RENT!• Comply with all other lease terms.• Comply with all rules and regulations.• Comply with housing and health codes.• Comply with all zoning restrictions.• Keep the apartment clean and sanitary.• Keep plumbing fixtures sanitary.• Do not damage the apartment.• Do not disturb your neighbors.

• Review a copy of the lease with an at-
torney prior to signing it.
• Expect to pay full rent, not just your 
share. This is what “joint and several” li-
ability means, a term included or implied in nearly all leases. 
• Obtain a copy of the lease and all at-
tachments or addendums to the lease, and put everything with your personal records.
• Have all promised repairs and improve-
ments written into the lease and signed by the landlord.
• Insist on seeing your actual unit.• Get clear written permission for any 
pets.
• Check for maintenance responsibilities 
when renting a house or duplex.
 DON’T:
• Do not sign a 12-month lease unless 
you are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
• Do not sign a 12-month lease with 
roommates unless all roommates are will-ing to rent for 12 months.
• Do not have your parents sign the 
lease or a parental guarantee agreeing to be responsible for rent, if possible. See if the landlord will accept an additional security deposit instead.
• Do not sign a lease with automatic re-
newal clause.
• Do not sign a lease that gives the land-
lord unlimited access to the apartment with-out notice or consent.
• Do not sign a lease based upon a 
model apartment.
• Do not sign a lease before visiting the 
neighborhood at various times during the day, at night and on weekends.
• Do not sign a lease until all agreements 
negotiated with the landlord are in writing.SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION16, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012
What Can Happen If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Failure to pay rent is the quickest way to be 
evicted! The landlord will serve a notice demand-ing payment of rent or possession of the apart-ment. If you fail to comply with the demand with-in three days, excluding weekends and holidays, eviction proceedings may be started. Neither surrender of the apartment or eviction ends your liability for rent! You should contact an attorney immediately upon receipt of a three-day notice.
What Exactly Is An Eviction?An eviction is the formal end to your right to 
occupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You must 
file an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attor-ney immediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment for 
possession of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be entered for the landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at the apartment that requires you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and your personal property from the apartment.
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Rea-
son?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you vio-
late any lease terms, rules and regulations, or the Act. If your lease is terminated and you do not vacate the apartment, the landlord may file for your eviction immediately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice. Your 
options depend on whether the violations are classified as “curable” or “noncurable”.If you receive either type of notice, you should 
contact an attorney. Neither termination of your lease, nor your eviction from the apartment ends your liability for rent!
Curable Violations: You will be given seven 
days to correct a curable violation. Curable viola-tions include unauthorized pets, guests, parking, or the failure to keep the apartment clean and sani-tary. If you repeat the violation within 12 months, you will not be given another chance.
Noncurable Violations: The landlord may 
terminate your lease with a 7-day notice without giving you a chance to correct a noncurable vio-lation. Noncurable violations include deliberate destruction or misuse of the landlord’s property or a continued, unreasonable disturbance. 
Can I Be Evicted If I Pay “My” Rent and 
My Roommates Don’t?
Usually. Most leases provide that the tenants 
are jointly and severally liable for the entire rent. This means the landlord can evict you unless the full rent is paid.
It is possible for you to sue your roommates 
in small claims court to collect their share of the rent and utilities. A written roommate agreement will be helpful in proving your case in court. 
 Given the difficulty of collecting money on a 
judgment quickly, the best thing you can do is obtain new roommates.
So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!Any judgment for money damages is enforce-
able for at least 20 years and earns interest. A judgment may be enforced by seizing your wages, bank accounts, or your personal property. A judg-ment will also adversely affect your credit rating.

What Can I Do About 
Noisy Neighbors?
Try to reason with the neigh-
bor to reach an acceptable 
compromise. Thin walls and conflicting schedules make some amount of noise distur-bance an unavoidable reality of apartment living.
Ask the landlord for assis-
tance. If the landlord refuses to correct the problem, you may be able to break your lease. Be-cause the law in this area is so poorly developed, legal repre-sentation is a necessity. 
In extreme cases, call the 
police and report the matter. Unfortunately, this can lead to revenge and reprisals. 
I Can’t Stand My Room-
mate. What Can I Do?
Discuss the matter with your 
roommate immediately. Don’t ignore the problem with the hope that it will go away. A little give and take may result in a livable compromise. 
Under the Act, your land-
lord is not responsible for most roommate disputes. If your roommate is violating the lease, you should consult an attorney.My Landlord Refuses to 
Make Repairs, What Can I Do?
You MAY be able either to with-
hold your rent or terminate your lease if the problem constitutes a material breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact requirements of the Act. 
 You must give the landlord 
a written notice demanding the repairs be made in seven days. The notice must indicate an in-tent to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made. 
This is a complicated process 
and the legal consequences are very serious. Do not attempt to terminate your lease or withhold rent without first obtaining legal advice.
Can I Deduct Repair Costs 
From My Rent?
No. The Act does not autho-
rize you to make repairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most apartment leases prohibit repairs by tenants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a qualified right to terminate the lease or withhold rent. As pre-viously indicated, you should consult an attorney before at-tempting to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
Can I use My Security Deposit for the Last Month’s Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for non-payment of 
rent even when your “security deposit” is equal to your last 
month’s rent. The purpose of the security deposit is to protect the landlord against damages to the apartment.
Does the Law Require Interest Payments on Secu-
rity Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits in one of three meth-
ods. Two methods of holding the deposits require interest to be paid. The method which does not require interest payment is the one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held, and whether you will receive interest.
What Can I Do If My Landlord Doesn’t Return My 
Deposit?
A landlord shall have 15 days after termination of the lease 
to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise required, if he or she does not intend to impose a claim on the security deposit. If the landlord intends to impose a claim in the security deposit, he or she shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail, stating how much is going to be deducted and why. You must object to the deduc-tion in writing within 15 days from the date you receive the notice, or the landlord will be authorized to deduct his or her claim from your security deposit.
If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 
30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit.
However, if you damaged the apartment, the landlord can 
sue you even when the 30-day notice is not given. Because the landlord can also get court costs and attorney’s fees, you should consult an attorney before filing any lawsuits.GETTING IT BACKSPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTIONWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE , 17
Information reprinted with permission from UF's  Student Legal ServicesHOW SOON MUST I RENEW MY LEASE?
No. Unless there is an emergency or you have abandoned your apartment, 
the landlord must provide reasonable notice and obtain your consent prior to 
entering your apartment. 
You cannot unreasonably withhold consent. If the landlord persists in enter-
ing without notice or consent, contact an attorney.CAN MY LANDLORD ENTER 
MY APARTMENT WITHOUT NOTICE?There is no time period established by 
the Act. You should not sign a lease that 
provides for automatic renewals or requires you to give the landlord a notice of nonre-newal. If you do sign such a lease, you must strictly comply with the notice requirements imposed by the lease. There are some limits to the enforceability of these clauses. Con-tact an attorney if you have any questions.
If the lease does not specify otherwise, 
renewals are a matter of general contract law. The landlord cannot force you to renew prior to the end of your lease.  However, if you do not renew by the landlord’s “dead-line,” the landlord may rent your apartment to someone else.

Gators midfielder Holly King 
goes by a couple of different 
names.
When she is around her team-
mates, she’s Holly. When she is on the Williston Elementary School campus, she’s Ms. King.
Every Wednesday, the senior 
defensive midfielder teaches a fourth grade class at the Levy County elementary school. 
King is majoring in elemen-
tary education and has wanted to teach for as long as she can re-member.
“It’s an extremely humbling 
experience … to go in every day and want to change someone’s life,” she said. “It sounds [cliché], but it’s true.”
King said her fourth- and fifth-
grade teachers inspired her to go into the field, adding she prefers teaching fourth- and fifth-grad-ers.
“I like the older [kids],” she 
said, laughing. “I think my per -
sonality matches better with the older ones.”
Coach Becky Burleigh said 
having someone in the midfield who knows how to effectively in-struct others is a big asset.
“Having Holly on the team is 
like having a coach on the field,” Burleigh said. 
Although King said she doesn’t 
try to use her teaching skills on the field, she thinks learning how to teach might have made her a better teammate.
“Teaching is talking a lot; it’s 
communicating,” she said. “It’s a 
public speaking 
spot, so obvious-ly I don’t mind communicating on the field. So maybe that does correlate.”
Her team-
mates, both new 
and old, said they have learned a lot from King.
“I’ve kind of watched Holly 
and how she leads the team every day in practice,” freshman Chris-ten Westphal said.
“Off the field, she motivates 
us. Pre-game (and) during the game, she just gets us going. She teaches in a way that is by exam-ple. You kind of just watch what she does.’”
On Oct. 29, the Southeast-
ern Conference named King the league’s defensive player of the year and placed her on the All-SEC first team.
Senior midfielder Erika Tym-
rak, who has teamed up with King her entire college career, has drawn a lot from King off the field.
“Holly is probably the most 
disciplined person I’ve ever met when it comes to school,” Tym-rak said. 
“She’s always in the library do-
ing her homework. … If I tell her I have homework or a test, she’ll be like, ‘Let’s go to the library and study for a few hours.’ She’s defi-nitely a good motivation there.”
However, King’s studiousness 
sometimes comes at a price for her teammates.
“I correct people’s grammar 
by accident,” King said. “It’s just a habit. ... It drives them crazy.”
While King’s teammates know 
all about her talent on the field, most of her students don’t know what their teacher does on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons in the fall.
“Only one girl knows that I’m 
on the soccer team,” she said. 
“She actually had our poster 
and recognized me. … I just kind of smiled and said, ‘Yeah, that’s me.’”

After notching 8 points and 3 rebounds in Washington’s 
loss on Tuesday, Brad Beal is averaging 12.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game in 2012. Senior midﬁ  elder Holly King says her weekly trips to teach elementary school students help her be a coach on the ﬁ  eld. See story, page 22.

� FLORIDA FACES WISCONSIN 
TONIGHT AT 7 IN THE O’DOME.
 KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Before the Gators began their sea-
son, they had already lost four players 
from their 16-man roster. 
As No. 10 Florida (1-0) prepares to 
take on No. 22 Wisconsin (1-0) tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center, the Gators may have to add another player to the list. 
  On Tuesday, coach Billy Donovan 
said senior Erik Murphy missed Mon-day’s practice and may sit out today’s game due to an illness. 
  “He was throwing up [Monday],” 
Donovan said. “I don’t know if it’s the ﬂ  u or what it is, but I don’t know how much he’ll even be able to do [Tues-day].”
  The depth problems started early 
for Florida. 
  Damontre Harris’ contribution 
to practice ended after the 6-foot-10 transfer from South Carolina suffered a labrum tear when a teammate fell on him during a preseason practice. Shortly after, sophomore Cody Larson left the team. 
  Casey Prather was next, suffering 
his second concussion in nine days on Nov. 5. Prather’s injury happened only four days before Florida’s season open-er against Georgetown.  
Then, on Thursday, Donovan sus-
pended Scottie Wilbekin.   Donovan hopes to have Murphy 
back tonight to avoid ﬁ  elding a smaller team against Wisconsin.
  “Wisconsin is a big, strong, physi-
cal team,” Donovan said. “They don’t make a lot of mistakes on the defen-sive end of the ﬂ  oor. … They take their time. They’re patient. They’re deliber-ate. They get the kind of shots that they want. They’re not afraid to go deep into the clock. So (it’s) deﬁ  nitely a challeng-ing game for us.”
  After missing Monday’s practice, 
Murphy is a step behind in preparing for Wisconsin. 
The forward missed the team’s Mon-
day ﬁ  lm session and didn’t know the Gators’ offensive or defensive plans for the Badgers before Tuesday afternoon. 
  “He’s got a lot he’s got to catch up 
on,” Donovan said. “At least if he can’t practice (Tuesday), being there to ab-sorb it mentally would be just as im-portant.”

  Offensive coordinator Brent Pease con-
ﬁ  rmed on Tuesday that Jeff Driskel is us-
ing crutches rather than a walking boot to move around on his sprained right ankle. 
  Coach Will Muschamp said on Monday 
that Driskel is doubtful for this weekend’s game against Jacksonville State after suffer-ing the injury in Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana on Saturday.
  “It just kind of depends day-to-day with 
the training room,” Pease said of Driskel’s chances of practicing this week.
  If Driskel doesn’t play, sophomore Ja-
coby Brissett will start in his place. Pease said Brissett’s strong work ethic despite not winning the starting job will serve him well.  “He’s been admirable about what he’s 
done,” Pease said. “To have to make some plays, as opposed to just taking reps to end the game, it shows he’s prepared.”
  Pease expects Brissett 
to be more pumped up 
than usual.
  “He’ll have probably 
a little more juice in his step,” Pease said. “He’s probably going to be pretty excited.”
  
  Run game: In the ﬁ  rst 
half of the season, Mike Gillislee carried the UF offense. In the latter half, he hasn’t produced at the same rate. 
  However, the Gators do not fault Gil-
lislee for his statistical downturn. Driskel on crutches for ankle THE END OF GREGULATION
  When asked what he thought about 
Florida’s lack of playmakers on Nov . 5, coach Will Muschamp was 
as close to honest as could ever be expected: “It is what it is. We’re where we are.”
  Translation: “We don’t have any.”  No unit deserves all the blame for Flor-
ida’s 118th-ranked passing offense, but the wide receivers are perhaps the biggest cul-prits. 
  Quarterback Jeff Driskel has been prone 
to poor decisions and inaccurate passes, and the offensive line has struggled to con-sistently build a pocket. 
  Regardless, the wideouts need to be 
more productive. 
Quinton Dunbar is UF’s leading wide re-
ceiver with 24 catches and 252 yards. 
That yardage total ties him for No. 402 in 
the NCAA with Rashad Lawrence of North-western, Cole Hubble of Texas San Antonio and Isaac Fruechte of Minnesota. Yeah…
  Collectively , the players listed at wide receiver on Flor-ida’s roster have 47 catches for 527 yards and six touchdowns. Combined, Dun-bar, Frankie Ham-mond Jr., Andre Debose, Latroy 
Pittman, Raphael Andrades and Solomon Patton have averaged 52.7 yards per game. If one player had that average, he would rank 15th in the Southeastern Conference and No. 125 nationally . 
  To some extent, Florida’s system is 
to blame. The Gators rank No. 117 in the NCAA in pass attempts, as coach Will Mus-champ has taken a ground-and-pound ap-proach. 
  But even when the receivers get opportu-
nities, they haven’t come through. UF pass Wideouts hurting bad offense    SEE HOOPS, PAGE 24

“He’s got some swelling on it. It’s a little black and blue, I 
think. I shaved it this morning. ... No, I didn’t. I really didn’t.” 
UF coach Will Muschamp 
on Jeff Driskel’s sprained ankle
“[Wisconsin doesn’t] make 
a lot of mistakes on the defen-
sive end of the ﬂ  oor. … They 
take their time. They’re patient. 
They’re deliberate. They get the 
kind of shots that they want. 
They’re not afraid to go deep 
into the clock. So (it’s) deﬁ  nitely 
a challenging game for us.”
Billy Donovan
UF coachand use Mike Rosario at shooting 
guard during its first two games. If Murphy has to miss tonight’s con-test, then Will Yeguete will likely slide to power forward, leaving a spot open at small forward. 
When asked if he had an experi-
enced, reliable and natural player at the position, Donovan said: “Right now? Nobody.”
Donovan added that the Gators 
would probably have to go back to playing three guards if Murphy is unavailable. 
He said either Michael Frazier II or DeVon Walker would slide into the starting lineup.
“The one thing I respect and ap-
preciate is our young guys have really had a great attitude just in terms of trying to be eager to learn and pay attention and realize that there’s been some things that have gone on inside of our team,” Dono-van said. 
“They’ve got to pick things up. 
It’s been challenging for them, but I think that they’ve worked to try to pay attention and figure out what we need from them.”

catchers have dropped 18 catchable 
throws this season. Hammond leads the way with seven. 
Some of those plays have been 
tougher than others, and you expect some drops. 
But normally , those drops are 
balanced by explosive plays. Those have been nonexistent since Flori-da’s win against Tennessee on Sept. 15. 
Maybe Florida needs to recruit better players. Stefon Diggs, a five-star prospect who was the No. 2 wideout and No. 8 overall player in the class of 2012, was essentially down to Maryland and Florida be-fore opting to join the Terrapins. In his first season, he has 43 catches for 721 yards and six touchdowns de-spite missing the most recent game due to an ankle injury . 
Five-star prospect Nelson Ag-
holor, Rivals’ No. 3 wideout and No. 18 player in the class of 2012, was also considering Florida before choosing to become the fourth op-tion at USC. In his freshman season, he has 16 catches for 291 yards and a touchdown, including a six-catch, 162-yard game against Oregon. His stats aren’t awe-inspiring, but he still has more receiving yards than any wideout on UF’s roster. 
Maybe a new crop of recruits, 
led by four-star commits Ahmad Fulwood and Alvin Bailey , will turn things around. But last year’s four-star wideout recruit, Latroy Pittman, has only two catches for 6 yards. 
The two four-star receivers 
brought in with the 2011 class, Java-res McRoy and Ja’Juan Story, aren’t even on the roster anymore. McRoy transferred to Texas Tech shortly after his signing, and Story left for TCU in August. 
In 2009, UF’s top wide receiver 
recruit was Andre Debose. Three years later, he still hasn’t made a consistent impact on the offense. 
With Muschamp likely to call a 
run-heavy attack for the foresee-able future, luring prime wideout recruits will likely be a challenge. As it is, offensive coordinator Brent Pease said he doesn’t see a big-time receiver on Florida’s roster. 
In a league with as much man-to-
man defense as the SEC, Pease said playing wideout is simple: “You run a route; you get open.”
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
none of the wideouts on the current roster can do that.

“They’re getting numbers in the box and their 
run fits are just plugging all of our gaps,” Pease 
said. “What we saw early is big runs. Now peo-ple have seen those plays. They’re making sure they’re sound on run fits.”
Facing loaded fronts has had a noticeable ef-
fect on the senior’s num-bers. Gillislee’s yardage total stood at 548 follow-ing the Gators’ 14-6 vic-
tory against LSU on Oct. 6 for an average of 109.6 yards per game. In Florida’s past five games, Gil-lislee has run for 58.8 yards per contest. 
Left tackle Xavier Nixon said the offensive 
linemen can block more effectively.
“Just keep grinding it out and try to defeat our 
opponents’ will and things will open up,” Nixon said.Kickin’ it: Caleb Sturgis may be a Lou Groza Award semifinalist this year, but he does not con-sider himself beyond criticism. The St. Augustine native is his own harshest critic.
“I didn’t kick off very well this past week,” 
Sturgis said. “(I) hurt the kickoff coverage team, but I’ve felt that I’ve made improvements on kickoffs this year.”
Sturgis had just one touchback on six kick-
offs against Louisiana. His touchback percentage of 45.3 ranks 38th nationally. He finished 2011 ranked 47th.
The senior kicker has reached his preseason 
goal of converting on 85 percent of his field goal attempts. Sturgis has 17 makes in 20 tries — ex-actly 85 percent.
“I just wanted to help the team in big situa-
tions, or any situations, really,” Sturgis said. “Just go out there and put points on the board any time I’m out there. But I’ve done a pretty good job at that, could always do better.”
