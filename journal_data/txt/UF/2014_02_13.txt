Sen. Bill Nelson and former Gov. Charlie 
Crist spoke at UF this week after the state de-
nied use of the Reitz Union as an early voting site.
The politicians came to voice their opinions 
about the state legislature’s exclusion of educa-tional facilities from its list of possible early vot-ing centers, which was expanded in 2013.
Crist, who visited the campus brieﬂ  y on 
Wednesday at a rally on Turlington Plaza, called on the crowd of roughly 100 to contact Gov. Rick Scott and Florida’s Secretary of State Ken Detzner.
“The last thing they ought to do to you is 
keep you from voting,” he said.
Lauren Nickoloff, the president of the UF 
College Democrats, said the club is already plan-
ning to send letters and call state legislators.
“We want to make sure that they know we 
are not happy with what they are doing,” said

A second suspect prosecu-
tors say is responsible for the 2012 
murder of a 78-year-old disabled 
Gainesville man could face the 
death penalty in a trial that started this week.
Austin M. Jones of Mulberry, 
Fla., is facing several charges in-cluding ﬁ  rst-degree murder, kid-napping and robbery, according to court records. Jones, 24, and his cousin broke into the home of Paul 
Quandt, who later died in the hos-
pital after he was beaten, stabbed and shocked with a Taser. 
Jones’ cousin, 25-year-old Ma-
randa J. Martin, was convicted last year on similar charges.Late on the 
night of Jan. 9, 2012, Jones and Martin broke into 
Quandt’s home 
at 4854 NW 75th Road armed with two pistols, two 
rolls of tape and 
the Taser, according to Alligator archives. 
Police said the pair took a safe 
with more than $20,000 in gold, sil-
ver, cash, guns and electronics then 
sped away in Quandt’s white Ca-
dillac, according to archives. 
They left Quandt at the house 
with his hands taped together. He 
was able to slip out of the tape us-
ing cooking oil, and he crawled to a neighbor’s house to ask for help be-fore slipping into a coma, according to archives. He died eight days later at UF Health Shands Hospital. 
State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-
man Darry Lloyd said the trial is expected to last three weeks, which includes a phase to determine 
whether Jones should receive the 
death penalty. State pursues death penalty for murder suspect

enters the kitchen for an epic pizza-making showdown, and 
Gainesville’s own Satchel’s has recently decided to accept its invitation to represent The Gator Nation.
The ﬁ  rst South Eastern Pizza Classic will take place April

Amateur paleontologists are hoping 
to bring ancient history to the 21st cen-
tury.
UF researchers will use a four-year, 
$1.97 million National Science Founda-
tion grant to create a national network 
of amateur and professional paleontolo-gists.
“Here’s an opportunity where we 
can get people from different parts of the country that have like interests to com-municate,” said Bruce MacFadden, the vertebrate paleontology curator at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
The FOSSIL Project — Fostering Op-
portunities for Synergistic STEM with 
Informal Learners — will create con-
nections with fossil clubs and societies around the country to educate amateurs and help digitalize fossils for collections.
The project’s long-term goals include 
an interactive website where users can input data, submit requests for informa-tion and connect with other paleontolo-gists.
“It creates an interface between re-
searchers and amateur collectors, which can be used as an outreach opportunity for the general public,” said Arianna Harrington, a UF biology graduate stu-dent and research assistant.
To begin building the relationship, 
amateur paleontologists have been invit-ed to participate in the North American Paleontological Convention on Saturday at the Florida Museum of Natural His-tory. 
Harrington said the community 
seems excited about the potential.
“Now with social networking and 
information being so permeable from 
one region to another … the digitaliza-
tion of fossils can be considered a direct result of how global things are getting,” she said. Grant to fund creation of FOSSIL network

For the second year in a row, voices from across 
the state will sing sans instruments at UF for the 
International Championship of Collegiate A Cap-pella 2014 Tournament.
The competition will be held Saturday at noon 
at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Tickets can be purchased at the UFPA box ofﬁ  ce for $10 or online.
The event is the ICCA South Quarterﬁ  nal No. 
4, which is traditionally scheduled at a university central to the participating groups.
Spencer Jordan, a 19-year-old UF family, youth 
and community sciences and English sophomore, is a part of No Southern Accent, the a cappella 
group at UF that is hosting the event.
“We really, really enjoy having the home-ﬁ  eld 
advantage, which doesn’t really mean too much in 
a cappella,” Jordan said. “It just means that your friends and family get to be in the audience more so than if we went to Georgia.”
He said there’s UF camaraderie while perform-
ing on campus but also a healthy competitive spirit.
No Southern Accent hosted the competition 
last year when it sold out University Auditorium, which is why it was moved to the Phillips Center.
A cappella groups from UF, the University of 
Miami, the University of Central Florida, Florida State University and Nova Southeastern Univer-sity will be included in the lineup.
Alexa Gedigian, a 22-year-old UF public rela-
tions senior, will be competing at the ICCA for the 
second time.
Gedigian is the business manager for the Sedoc-
taves, the all-female a capella group at UF, which 
hasn’t competed since 2011.
“Competition is really fun, but at the end of the 
day ... we all represent the University of Florida, 
and we’re so proud to have it here,” she said.A capella semi-

Gainesville city attorney Nicolle 
Shalley sent an inquiry to Scott’s 
administration regarding whether the Reitz Union could be used as an 
early voting center. In an advisory 
opinion responding to Gainesville’s request, Maria Matthews of the Florida Division of Elections stated educational facilities are not covered under the terms “convention cen-
ter” and “government-owned com-
munity center.”
Nelson, at Monday’s press con-
ference in the Reitz Union, said  Scott’s administration is trying to suppress UF’s student voters to in-fluence democratic votes for the up-coming November election.
“The statute allows early voting 
to occur in government-owned com-
munity centers,” Nelson said. “The 
last time I checked, the university is part of the public sector, which is a community facility that is not just used by students.” 
However, Gainesville Mayor Ed 
Braddy has a different opinion on the subject. Braddy said Nelson and Crist are using Gainesville’s early 
voting issue to bring attention to 
their campaigns. 
“The magic of an election year 
transforms the status quo into an act of voter suppression,” he said. 
While Gainesville had requested 
the Reitz as a municipal early vot-ing site, dates for early voting corre-spond with UF’s Spring Break when 
most students aren’t on campus, 
Braddy said.
Early voting locations include the 
Supervisor of Elections Office and the Millhopper Branch Library. 
Although the current locations 
might be out of some students’ reach, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said 
the university’s hands are tied.
“The University of Florida is not 
opposed to holding early voting on 
campus,” Sikes said. “Unfortunate-ly, we are precluded by state law from doing so.”“People take pride in being 
part of the SEC,” Parker said. 
“I’m sure it will be a heated competition.”
Satchel Raye, chef and own-
er of Satchel’s, said he has never been interested in competition when it comes to pizza.
But Raye said his mind 
changed when the Facebook status he made about this one received more likes and com-ments than any of the restau-rant’s past social media posts.
“What makes it interesting 
is now they make it an SEC 
competition,” he said. “So then 
all of a sudden it’s like, ‘Well,  how can you not?’”
Raye said he would be excit-
ed to see how the competition plays out because Satchel’s was built not only around pizza, but music, art and community as 
well.
“This is an interesting test 
because it takes our pizza out of that atmosphere,” he said.
However, Raye said he has 
never been nervous making 
pizza, and he doesn’t expect to see that change any time soon, even with a majority of the schools in the conference having already confirmed their participation.
“If there was any way I 
thought I could improve my 
pizza, I would have done it by 
now,” he said. “I think it can stand up.”
Dante Fowler, a 19-year-old 
UF telecommunication sopho-more and outside linebacker for the Gators, said he has as much faith in Satchel’s as he does in the team.
“They’re two hardworking 
companies that just want to get to the top and be the best at what they do,” he said. “If we win I’m gonna … throw a little party.”
Raye said he’d try to bring 
home the title for himself and UF.
“If we win,” he said, “we 
win for the Gators.”JENNA LYONS

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man Tuesday after police reported he 
was carrying a gun and 100 rounds of ammunition in his backpack with no permit.
Officers arrested 
27-year-old Philip Beaven Ciano on charges of carrying 
concealed weapons, according to an ar-rest report.
At about mid-
night, an officer no-
ticed Ciano riding 
his bicycle without proper lights on 
Northwest 23rd Terrace. 
When asked for ID, Ciano put his 
bag on the ground and started look-ing for his ID when the officer spotted the grip of a .22 caliber revolver in the backpack, according to the report. The officer tackled him to the ground. The gun was fully loaded.
During questioning, Ciano said he 
had been shooting in the woods ear-lier and forgot to take the gun out of his backpack. He said his mother was with him and could confirm his story.
When officers contacted her, she 
said the events never happened and told police her son is “mentally unsta-ble and severely depressed,” accord-ing to the report. 
Ciano told officers he bought the 
ammunition earlier at Wal-Mart. Offi-
cers asked Ciano if a surveillance video 
would show him buying the ammuni-tion, and he changed his story, saying he actually bought it a week ago at M&C Army Surplus.
Ciano was booked into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 1:30 a.m. Wednes-day, where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $40,000 bond.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2014

UF’s Curtis M. Phillips 
Center for the Performing 
Arts was ranked 20th overall in a national ranking of col-lege campus theaters.
The center was ranked in 
“The 25 Most Amazing Col-lege Campus Theaters” by the Best College Reviews this week. 
It was the only Florida 
school to make the list.
The center hosts national 
and international artists from around the world as well as student productions.  
It’s one of the largest col-
lege theaters in the nation, with seating for about 1,700 in the main hall and an ad-ditional 200 seats in the Black Box Theatre.
Some other highlights in the review include the cen-ter’s fountain and all-glass window exterior.
Michael Blachly, the di-
rector of UF Performing Arts, attributed the center’s value to its staff and audience. He said the center has an excep-tional professional crew that is highly skilled in produc-tion and publicity.
“Our programs reach a 
broad, diverse audience,” Blachly said. “We have a 
strong base of audience sup-
port.”
Todd Taylor, the public 
relations associate for the UF Performing Arts, said the variety of multicultural performances attract a wide audience.
“Artists come from all 
corners of the globe,” Taylor said. “We have dancers com-ing in from India, orchestras coming in from Russia, and students are able to see these types of performances right on campus.”
However, Alejandra Nash, 
a 21-year-old UF market-ing and event management junior and former intern at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, said the UF Cultural Plaza, where the center is lo-cated, has one main problem: parking.
“One time, there was an 
event at the Harn Museum and the Phillips Center at the same time, and there wasn’t enough parking, even with the garage,” Nash said. “Old people had to park by the la-crosse fields. They shouldn’t have to do that.”

Follett, the corporation in charge of the UF Bookstore, will 
soon manage all UF stadium sports stores and stands. 
Starting Feb. 27, Follett will run all stores formerly man-
aged by the LIDS Sports Group, because the contract was dis-
continued.
UF’s contract with the bookstore will be a separate con-
tract from the sports stores on campus. Mike Spiegler, senior associate athletics director, said Follett will sell all current in-ventories in the stores.“We reached out to Follett since they were already here on 
campus,” he said. “They do a great job at the bookstore. It’s a good fit for everyone at UF.”
Follett, like LIDS Sports Group, will pay UF a percentage 
of what they sell from the merchandise.
Nicole Neugebauer, a 19-year-old UF business freshman, said she’s concerned the prices will be expensive like the UF Bookstore merchandise.
“The stuff in the bookstore is a little overpriced,” she said. 
“If they’re taking over, I won’t be buying as much UF stuff on campus.”
 But Lynne Vaughan, director of UF Bookstores, said prices 
will mostly remain the same.
“We are working to bring in new inventory for the stores 
as well,” she said.

rent positions for the change.UF Bookstore parent company to manage stadium stores

STARKE — A man was executed Wednes-
day night for raping and killing a 9-year-old 
boy 18 years ago, a death that spurred the victim’s parents to press nationwide for stronger sexual predator confinement laws 
and better handling of child abduction cas-
es.Juan Carlos Chavez, 46, was pronounced 
dead at 8:17 p.m. Wednesday after a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, according to Gov. Rick Scott’s office.
Chavez made no final statement in the 
death chamber but did submit a statement laced with religious references in writing. 
Chavez abducted Jimmy Ryce at gun-
point after the boy got off a school bus on Sept. 11, 1995, in rural Miami-Dade County. Ryce’s parents turned the tragedy’s pain into a push for stronger U.S. laws regarding 
confinement of sexual predators and im-
proved police procedures in missing child cases. Their foundation gave hundreds of free dogs to law enforcement agencies to aid in searches for children.
The boy’s father, 70-year-old Don Ryce, 
witnessed the execution along with his son 
Ted, 37. They told reporters the execution 
closes a long, painful chapter and hopefully sends a powerful message to other would-be child abductors.
“Don’t kill the child. Because if you do, 
people will not forget, they will not forgive. We will hunt you down, and we will put you to death,” Ryce said.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Gotham isn’t the only city with a 
soft spot for bats.
Bat fanatics will be able to see 
the thousands of foraging, furry 
free-tails living in the UF Bat Barn without enduring the musky smell. By the end of the month, a camera inside the barn will be live stream-
ing on the Florida Museum of Nat-
ural History’s website.
Sarah Fazenbaker, the mu-
seum’s webmaster, said a camera was mounted inside the barn last 
week and is fully functional. How-
ever, she said there isn’t a set date for when the stream will be online because it takes “a little tinkering” 
to get the power, Internet connec-
tivity, camera angle and lighting right.
Fazenbaker said there used to 
be a camera in the next-door Bat 
House, but it was shut off last year 
because the environment inside was too hostile for the equipment, and it made maintenance problematic.
The barn is structured in a way 
that will keep the camera cleaner than it was in the Bat House, she 
said, and the equipment will hope-
fully last longer.
Fazenbaker said the camera is 
not being used for scientific study. Staff decided to install it for the 
public’s benefit because of high in-
terest in the nightly bat viewing.
“What I didn’t know until we 
did this whole project was that they actually move around quite a bit 
during the day,” she said. “They 
do fly around in there, so there is actually something to look at — if there’s enough living in the barn.”
Candace McCaffery, the muse-
um’s mammals collection manager, said bats are picky about where they live.
It took years for the bats to 
warm up to the barn, she said, even though it was primed with bat fe-ces to make it smell attractive to the animals.
The Bat House was built to re-
locate the bats living in the stadi-ums and old buildings on campus. When the internal structure of the house collapsed in 2009 because of 
too many bats, it was remodeled, 
and the additional barn was built in 2010.
“I think we’re really fortunate, 
though, that it actually worked and that we have this big colony here,” McCaffery said. “It’s great for us for some insect control, and it’s a great viewing thing for campus.”
The museum currently has a 
camera installed on an exterior pole, which is already streaming live on its website. Observers any-
where can watch about 300,000 bats 
emerge at dusk with just a click of a button.
UF veterinary first-year gradu-
ate student Jared Baum, 22, said he’s seen the bats fly from the struc-tures two or three times, and he said he thinks the new technology is a good idea.
“It’s pretty interactive,” he said.

In 2009, 15-year-old Claire 
Dunlap went into cardiac arrest 
while playing varsity softball for 
her high school. If it hadn’t been 
for the CPR equipment on site, the incident could have killed her.
“It can happen to anyone at 
anytime,” Dunlap said.
Now a 20-year-old UF adver-tising junior, Dunlap will speak 
at GatorSavers’ mass CPR certifi-
cation at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom on Saturday. 
The event will certify 800 peo-
ple in American Heart Associa-
tion’s Adult CPR and Automated 
External Defibrillator, or AED, during three different sessions — 9:30 a.m., noon and 2:30 p.m. It 
will be Gainesville’s largest CPR 
certification, according to the American Heart Association.There is a $5 cost to attend the 
event, said Clay Gibbons, direc-tor of sales and marketing for Ga-torCPR.
“Any money raised will be 
used to provide an AED to the 
community,” he said.
He said GatorCPR is trying to 
reduce the “bystander effect” by 
training people in CPR and mak-
ing them feel comfortable with it.  
He said he hopes the event will influence people to take action and increase the 
survival rate of cardiac arrest, which is an esti-mated 7 percent in the state of 
Florida, he said.
 “The goal 
of this event is 
to try to get people to take CPR class who would otherwise not 
take CPR class,” Gibbons said.
There will be 57 volunteer in-structors at the event who will 
train participants on Adult CPR, 
saving people from choking and how to use the AED.
Chrissy Hankin, a 19-year-old 
UF elementary education sopho-
more, said she is attending be-
cause it is a good opportunity for a low price.

Gainesville’s own environmentally focused 
film-and-arts festival is back for its fifth year.
The Cinema Verde Film Festival, which 
starts today and lasts until Sunday, will be lo-cated in the newly renovated 
Depot Station, Gainesville’s oldest train depot, located at 201 SE Depot Ave.
Trish Riley, the direc-
tor and founder of Cinema 
Verde, said the festival cre-
ates a support system for 
people like business owners 
who choose the untraditional and sometimes costly path of sustainable practices.“Our goal is to connect those folks with 
an audience of customers so everyone can strengthen each other, and there can be more forward motion towards sustainability,” Riley said.
Don Hardy, co-director of the Human Ex-
periment, said he submitted his film to the fes-tival because of its solid reputation.
“Hopefully it’s eye-opening,” Hardy said of 
his film.  Produced by Sean Penn, it highlights harmful chemicals in everyday products. Bill Zhou, a 20-year-old UF marketing 
sophomore who interns for the festival, said his first year interning has been positive be-cause of the company culture. 
“We’re trying to work towards a greener 
world,” Zhou said.
Along with the films, the festival will fea-
ture several food trucks and an outdoor bar. 
“People do appreciate it,” Riley said, “and 
it makes me feel like what I’m doing is worth-while.”Cinema Verde to bring sustainability, food trucks to Depot Station

The Swamp Party is 
the Unite Party
UF’s Student Government has become a one-party system, 
and you should know where that party came from.
With the failed attempts of the Taco Libre Party to 
qualify and the Students Party to organize, the Swamp Party is essentially running unopposed — which some may say they’ve 
been doing for years. But the domination is worse than ever. 
Facebook events encouraging people to vote Swamp tout ac-
complishments like 24/5 Library West hours and reﬁ  llable wa-
ter-bottle stations. But don’t be fooled. Those additions date back to before Swamp’s creation in Fall 2012. How is that possible?
The Swamp Party is the Unite Party. Swamp rose out of 
Unite’s ashes after a series of unfortunate events forced the par-ty’s organizers to rebrand.
In 2010, the Unite Tapes leaked. They revealed party ofﬁ  cials 
discussing intimidation tactics to increase voter turnout. Sorori-ties were implicated for giving members alcohol in exchange for votes and refusing to let pledges eat until they voted.
Then, in Spring 2012, after football coach Will Muschamp 
endorsed Gator walk-on and Students Party VP candidate Jesse Schmitt, Unite Party volunteer and then-Senate president pro tempore Jason Tiemeier threw away 268 copies of the Alligator from bins at Weimer Hall.
Soon after, Tj Villamil, who would later be elected Student 
Body president, appeared in a YouTube video criticizing the Al-ligator and falsely claiming it had refused SG’s request that it cut expenses to help UF. (SG doesn’t support the Alligator. That’s why it’s called The Independent Florida Alligator). 
That election, the Unite Party’s president and VP beat the 
Students Party nominees by 114 votes. It was the highest voter turnout since 1983. It was clear something had to change. 
So Unite became Swamp. To keep voters from remembering 
Unite’s shady history, Swamp tried to disassociate itself, even 
ﬁ  ling an elections violation complaint against the Students Party 
for claiming Unite had been replaced by Swamp. Swamp main-tained that only 10 candidates had been involved with Unite. 
If Swamp and Unite are so different, why are Swamp candi-
dates on Facebook right now taking credit for Unite successes? 
To be fair, most of the Swamp candidates in next week’s elec-
tions never ran under Unite. Also, it’s undeniable that services like 24/5 Library West and reﬁ  llable water-bottle stations are great. They beneﬁ  t students, and we love them. But if Swamp 
is going to acknowledge Unite’s accomplishments, why won’t it 
acknowledge Unite’s oversights? 
In any case, Swamp doesn’t have a squeaky clean past, ei-
ther. 
Last year, the Alligator published an email sent by Leah Mill-
er, a liaison between the Swamp Party and its fraternity house representatives, which asked them to collect “I Voted” stickers  and supply the party with a $250 check.
It ended with a request for readers to “DELETE THIS AF-
TER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANY-THING ON RECORD!” 
Miller’s ﬁ  nal words seem representative of Unite/Swamp/
whatever tactics: “Sketchy, but do it! Thanks!”

OK?Today’s question: Do you hate Valentine’s Day?Lessons about love rise out of tragedy
A bipolar man and reformed alcoholic kidnapped his 
son while his wife was at work one day. He didn’t get too far, though.
Driving home, his wife saw their car parked on the 
side of the road. In the passenger seat was their 2-year-old son. Underneath the driver’s seat was a bottle of bourbon, empty.
Finally waking him from an alcohol-induced slumber, 
she tersely told him to clean up his act and took her son to her mother’s.
Sometime later, the phone rang. He was on the other 
end — a pay phone. He told her he could turn right, go home and continue attending Alcoholics Anonymous, or he could turn left and be gone from her life forever.
Love supersedes reason. She told him to go home; they 
could work it out.
He went home but never made it to another AA meet-
ing. The last thing he knew was the taste of cold metal and the click of a ﬁ  ring pin against a bullet.
It’s been 19 years since my father killed himself. My 
mom still has the gun in her closet; I’ve seen it. I never un-derstood why she kept it but remain as unsure of how she could throw it out in the ﬁ  rst place.
Love supersedes reason.For a long time, I harbored hatred toward my coward 
father. With time, I’ve realized he was no coward, and I have no hate left to give. In fact, his actions taught me ev-erything I know about love.
My mom lost her dad to cancer a week later. She lost her 
job not long after that. They tried to force her to work over-night, even though that was impossible for a single mother with a toddler. Even when she was losing so much, she still gave me everything. She bought a house in a nice area with good schools, she read to me every day and loved me more than I can fathom. She still does.
Mom taught me love is giving.A couple of years went by, and my mom found a new man. 
He stuck around a while and 
moved in after a couple of years. By the time I was 7, I was calling him dad.
My dad, not my father, taught 
me about being a man. He played catch with me. He taught me how to ﬁ  sh. He loved me. By the time I 
was 7, he was calling me son. I was not a responsibility or burden or anyone else’s.
Dad taught me love is accepting.My dad wasn’t to remain childless for long. My brother 
was born when I was 8 and a half. I didn’t know what to do. Then, I realized he didn’t either, so I went to work. I read to him, played with him and helped him learn to talk.
As he got older, he got a little more annoying, as sib-
lings do. I’d get frustrated with his persistent insistence on playing with me 24 hours a day. I hated that I was stuck with chores he was too young to do.
One day, it hit me. He read all the same books I did 
when I was his age and played the same games as me. He would steal my too-big-for-him clothes to look like me. I was his role model. That helped me look at who I was to make sure I was becoming the person I wanted to be and someone he could look up to at the same time.
My brother taught me that love is teaching and learn-
ing.
Rationality and evolution dictate humans to act in self-
interest. And yet, parents often sacriﬁ  ce everything for their children, resulting in a lower quality of life for them-selves. When you love someone, you won’t stand outside a burning building while they burn. You go in and save them.

Thongs. Sparkles. Lace. Strip. Tease. Art.
That’s burlesque done by the Mischie-
vous Madams, Gainesville’s first burlesque 
troupe, which will host a singles’ auction 
Saturday in an effort to give back to the community.
Made up of seven performers, the Mad-
ams make their own costumes, which they shimmy out of piece by piece until only a thong and pasties are left.
The troupe’s assistant manager, whose 
stage name is Lolita Lopez, said a challenge 
of doing burlesque is that it is often thought 
of as just stripping.
But she said she thinks of it as more of an 
art form.
“It’s incredibly body-positive and femi-
nist,” she said. “And I love it. I really love it.”
Lopez also said she likes the amount of 
freedom she has with her performances, 
which allows her to incorporate her classical 
ballet training into her performances.
Another troupe member, whose stage 
name is Sally Sucre, said what’s beautiful 
about burlesque is that there is a different 
story behind every act.
“I like being naked,” she said. “It’s very 
liberating. But I like that it’s also art.”
On Saturday, the troupe will  take a break 
from the stage to host its singles’ auction.
The proceeds will go to organizations in 
the community, which Lopez said is a major source of support for the troupe.
Bachelors and bachelorettes will be auc-
tioned off on a date at the event.
It will take place at 10:30 p.m. at The 
Backyard at Boca Fiesta & Palomino, at 232 SE First St.
All the proceeds will go to the Civic Me-
dia Center, a local alternative library, and 
Peaceful Paths, a certified domestic abuse 
network that helps survivors of domestic violence, said Stephen Tierney, the troupe’s manager.     
If anyone 18 or older is interested in be-
ing auctioned off, he or she can sign up at The Backyard, he said.
Those who sign up be-
fore the event will get in 
free before midnight, Lopez 
said. For everybody else, the cover is $5.
People who sign up to be 
auctioned off will put down 
their names, turn-ons and turn-offs and if they would like men, women or both to bid on them.
This is the Madams’ second singles auc-
tion, Tierney said. Last year the group raised more than $1,200 for the Lynnae Hottinger Foundation for Ovarian Cancer Research.
Tierney isn’t sure if any couples who met 
at the auction last year are still together, but he said people seemed happy with the pair-ings.
“I’ve seen people get up there and kiss 
right when they get on stage,” he said.
Lopez compared the event to karaoke. It 
starts off a little slow, but as people drink more, everybody wants to join in.   
Lopez said if anyone doesn’t feel a spark 
with his or her bidder, he or she can opt out of the date. Bid money won’t be accepted, and the date doesn’t have to happen.
“We don’t want people feeling uncom-
fortable, but we do want people to broaden 
their horizons and meet new friends,” she 
said.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2014

Hollywood is coming out, one small step at a time.
As thousands watched the widely publicized marriage of 
same-sex couples during the 2014 Grammy award ceremony on Jan. 26, the same night TV viewers were introduced to Dis-ney’s first lesbian couple on the show “Good Luck Charlie.”   
Disney received mixed reactions to the brief appearance 
of Susan and Cheryl, the first same-sex couple, when they dropped off their daughter for a play date with the main character. 
The company has also received attention for the alleged 
inclusion of same-sex parents in its blockbuster movie “Fro-zen,” a theory that has not been confirmed or denied. 
“I think it has to do with the increased mobilization of queer politics, where a queer family structure can be just as 
normal as heterosexual,” said Justin Grant, a UF feminist and 
queer studies graduate assistant. “We’re seeing a translation in mainstream media where a queer family structure isn’t necessarily risque or threatening.”
Though the first gay television character 
appeared on CBS’s “All in the Family” in 1971, only recently have companies started to feature LGBT identified people in shows and commercials. Fox’s “Glee” saw the engagement of Kurt and Blaine, two gay teenagers. ABC’s Emmy-winning “Mod-ern Family” focuses on a gay couple and 
their adopted daughter, and Coca-Cola and Chevrolet have received attention for featuring same-sex families in their re-spective Super Bowl and Olympics commercials.“I think that it’s great, that it shows that television is get-
ting more diverse,” said Liliana Bello, a 19-year-old UF chem-ical engineering freshman. “I’m honestly surprised that this hasn’t happened sooner.”
Despite receiving support from Miley Cyrus, Harry Styles 
and fans of the show, Disney was attacked by conservative groups such as One Million Moms for “pushing an agenda” of “controversial topics that children are far too young to comprehend.” Five-year-old Mia Talerico, who plays Char-lie on Disney’s “Good Luck Charlie,” also received defaced pictures of herself and death threats on Instagram after the episode aired.
It’s unlikely that the couple will appear on the show again 
since the show’s last episode airs Sunday, but many see this as the first of many LGBT Disney characters to come.
 “I think we’re slowly starting to see Disney make that turn 
that other broadcasting companies are doing,” Grant said. “Within the next 10 to 15 years, I believe there will be a LGBT main character in a Disney movie or show.”

This winter, a soft, humble plea for clo-
sure came on the radio. 
A Great Big World’s “Say Something” 
captivated hopeless romantics and trou-
bled teens — its vocals shaky but stern, its 
melody light but haunting.
But if you’re looking for the slow build 
and soft power that the chart-topper 
hashed out, you won’t find it on the duo’s album “Is There Anybody Out There?”
Whereas “Say Something” serves as a 
theme song for the broken, “Is There Any-body Out There?” is fast-paced and hap-py-go-lucky, stuffed with condescendingly 
cliché verses about the stars, the sea and 
life getting better (they promise!).
As I heard the album beginning to end, I 
tried to picture when I would listen to it — on the bus? No. Studying? Nope.
It’s so cheesy, it probably only plays 
while couples cook Sunday breakfast to-gether, reaching over each other to flip eggs and laughing while they do it.
The two singers consis-
tently alternate — some-
times Ian Axel’s nerdy-
folk voice will take lead, like in “Say Something.” Then Chad Vaccarino — the guy you didn’t even know was in the band — 
rings in, his voice deeper, more boring.
Neither of them have much range — 
you can tell when they squeak at higher 
notes and squawk at lower ones. But 
there’s a comfort in that. They aren’t the powerhouse pop group they never prom-ised to be. Instead, the duo’s awkward har-mony boasts a talk-singing Broadway vibe coupled with the hopefulness of a Santa Monica street band – think fun. meets One Direction.
The “Everyone is Gay” track, for in-
stance, starts and ends with a bumpy back track that makes it feel childish. Even the lyrics made me roll my eyes —“If you’re 
gay then you’re gay … If you’re straight 
well that’s great.” This is only repeated in songs like “I Really Want It” with lines like “I’m not giving up” and “All you need is inside yourself.”
I tried hard to relate to “Is There Any-
body Out There?” but the whole album felt like two dudes sat down and tried to write what they thought music should be 
instead of pouring out their personal ex-
periences like “Say Something” suggested they would.

The question everyone was waiting for was finally asked: 
“How you like your eggs?” “Fried or fertilized!” responded the 
crowd.
Yung Humma, Flynt Flossy and Whatchyamacallit of the 
independent record label Turquoise Jeep performed their You-Tube hit, “Fried or Fertilized,” and several other songs for fans Tuesday night  at High Dive.
The label, known for its humorous sex-lathered lyrics and 
equally titillating YouTube videos, gave spectators a show to re-member and sweat for.
“By the end of the show, we want you to be sweating just 
as much as we are,” said Pretty Raheem, another artist on the label.
And sweat they did.During the group’s performance of “Licky Sticky,” single 
women were called to the stage to receive lap dances.
Gabriel Allen, a 22-year-old Ocala resident, became an instant 
“Jeep Rider” — as fans of the label call themselves — when his friend showed him videos on YouTube.
Allen said the label is all about good vibes and having fun.Yung Humma and Flynt Flossy performed what is perhaps 
the label’s greatest hit, “Lemme Smang It,” which has almost 12 million views on YouTube. 
The audience went crazy, reciting lyrics like, “Ima have you 
looking like a Wild Thornberry.”
Will Baldock, a 21-year-old UF microbiology 
senior, has been a Turquoise Jeep fan since his freshman year.
“I think their songs are really funny and pro-
vide a resound amount of entertainment,” he 
said.
Baldock said the concert was everything he 
hoped for and more. 
“It blew my mind,” he said.
Yip Deceiver, a duo formed by Davey Pierce and Nicolas 
“Dobby” Dobbratz, formerly in the band of Montreal, opened for Turquoise Jeep.
The duo’s energetic and pop-tastic sound had even those who 
weren’t familiar with them bopping along almost instantly.
After their time in of Montreal, Pierce and Dobby formed 
Yip Deceiver because they desired to finally do their own thing, Pierce said.
“We’ve been making music ourselves for God knows how 
long and just kind of got tired of doing other people’s stuff,” he 
said. “It’s good doing your own thing.” Turquoise Jeep rocks High Dive with jamsBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Time heals all wounds, and the Gators 
are hoping several have been patched up 
since last season. 
A mass exodus to professional base-
ball left Florida searching for innings 
and at-bats. The departure of 69 percent 
of its home runs and 81 percent of its RBIs shifted Florida’s focus to small ball on offense. 
Florida scored 107 fewer runs last sea-
son. It is no secret the little things at the plate caused the Gators issues. Florida had a 7-11 record in one-run and extra-inning games — a trend No. 23 Florida hopes to reverse when it opens its season against Maryland on Friday at 7. 
“We lost a lot of one-run games (and) 
a lot of close games,” junior first baseman Zack Powers said. “It all comes down to little details.”
Seventh-year coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
has harped on those little details since he arrived at Florida. There was more room for error in 2012 with a starting lineup that featured five hitters who are now in professional leagues at some level. 
That caliber of veteran college base-
ball talent is few and far between. A lack of depth made its absence hurt even more. Now with a restocked freshman class and underclassmen who experi-enced the sting of a sub-.500 record, the Gators can move past a frustrating sea-
son.
“We had a tough time doing all of 
that little stuff, but that season is done

Senior all-arounder Alaina Johnson took to the floor 
for the first time in more than a year on Feb. 7 in Florida’s 
(5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) win against Kentucky. 
Johnson’s 2014 debut floor score (9.825) tied with two oth-
ers for fourth overall in the meet. 
“I thought she competed aggressively, which is what 
we were looking for,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
The last time the Tyler, Texas, native competed on 
floor, she had a similar result. On Jan. 18, 2013, Johnson scored a 9.875 in a home win against Missouri. 
“It had been a while, but I wasn’t anymore nervous than other times,” Johnson said.
Johnson competed on vault, uneven 
bars and balance beam at every meet so far this season, but Kentucky was her first all-around meet of the year. 
“For Alaina coming in and doing all 
four events for the very first time in a year, it’s really exceptional that she was confident and just very consistent across 
the board,” Faehn said.
She joined sophomore Bridget Sloan and junior Kytra 
Hunter in the all-around lineup for the meet.
“Whereas Kytra and Bridget have had five meets up to 
this point doing all-around and competed all-around all last year, as well, so it’s a little smoother of a transition I’m sure for those athletes than Alaina is really kind of a 
new start,” Faehn said. 
In 2013, Johnson competed in the first three meets of 
the season, but a stress reaction and fracture in her lower 
back forced her to sit out for eight of the next meets in the 
year. Johnson eventually returned to compete vault and 
uneven bars in NCAA postseason meets. 
But Johnson, the defending NCAA uneven bars cham-
pion, maintains she hasn’t been overworking her fragile body even in practice. 
“The coaches are very smart,” Johnson said. Senior seeking impact on floor despite nagging injuriesEDEN OTERO

If Florida was looking for redemption after its 
20-8 loss at No. 1 North Carolina on Saturday, the 
team’s 21-5 win over Jacksonville was just that.
Opening the game, JU took the draw and pro-
ceeded down the field taking the first goal of the game. However, UF countered with a 7-0 run un-til 17:05 when JU took its second goal.
By the end of the half, 
the Gators outshot the Dol-phins 21-5 and held a 14-3 lead.
For the game, juniors Shannon Gilroy and Nora 
Barry made big plays that resulted in a combined eight points and five ground balls to help lead the team to its first win of the season.
The big issue coming into Wednesday’s match 
against Jacksonville was whether Florida could turn around a 24-12 loss on ground balls and an 18-11 loss on draw controls.
Winning 16-10 on ground balls and 14-4 on 
draw controls in the first half alone, the Gators (1-
1) came out looking like a team that had already 
decided the Dolphins’ fate.
Gilroy, who was the standout player of the 
night scoring seven points on eight shots on 
goal and winning six draw controls, credited the 
team’s work in practice to the win against JU (0-2).
Coach Amanda O’Leary felt that Gilroy did a 
good job leading the team after the loss at UNC, 
but she also said that her effort on ground balls 
and draws made a big difference in overall game play.
“I thought Shannon did a phenomenal job on UF dominates 
JU in first home game of season

Turgeon said. “We’re looking at this [season]. We come out and practice that stuff all the time. Like Sully always said, 
little stuff wins games.”
This will be the second-
straight year of Sully Small Ball. 
If the Gators struggle offensive-ly in 2014, another cliche, al-beit Valentines’ Day appropri-ate, might fit better: “Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” 
Weekend rotation an-
nounced: Junior left-hander Bobby Poyner will take the hill as Florida’s opening night start-er against Maryland. He posted a 3.41 ERA in 14 appearances last season.
Poyner registered an out 
against South Carolina in the College World Series two years 
ago. Joining the Wellington na-
tive will be freshman Brett Mo-rales on Saturday and senior right-hander Karsten Whitson for the series finale.
The Cincinnati Reds select-
ed Morales in the 24th round 
in June. Whitson will make his 
first start since March 26, 2012, after missing 2013 with season-ending right shoulder surgery.
Gators filling outfield spot: 
After sophomore outfielder Harrison Bader crashed his scooter and Gainesville Police began an investigation regard-ing his blood-alcohol level at the time, Florida has been left without a starting outfielder.
Freshman Ryan Larson is 
the favorite to replace Bader, 
whom Florida suspended in-
definitely on Feb. 4.
Larson has the ability to 
move runners and get on base — not too different from the human energizer bunny that Bader often was in his fresh-man year.
“He’s just a smart baseball 
player. He knows what he’s do-ing,” sophomore right-hander Eric Hanhold said. “He doesn’t make mistakes. He’s a solid all-around player.”
Martin eyeing shortstop 
return: A fractured right index finger suffered while attempt-ing a sacrifice bunt in the se-
ries against Miami on March 3 
forced shortstop Richie Martin to wear a cast, miss 12 games and move to center field upon his return. His absence in the infield meant second baseman Casey Turgeon platooned with Cody Dent up the middle. 
“To tell you the truth, I 
thought it was pretty fun,” Martin said of center field. 
“Shortstop is my natural posi-
tion ... But I had no problem go-ing to the outfield and helping the team out.”the draw,” O’Leary said. “She 
dominated.”
Freshman Mollie Stevens, 
who made her first career start 
and scored her first goal against 
UNC on Saturday, was the high-est scoring freshman on the team, putting up three points against JU and scooping one ground ball. 
“I am so pleased with Mollie,” 
O’Leary said. 
“She is typically an attacker 
and we’ve thrown her into the 
midfield, which is a huge transi-
tion for an attacker, so I think she has taken on that defensive role with a smile.”
Stevens is one of three fresh-
men to start for the Gators. She has four points in Florida’s first two games. 
Her first goal against JU came 
30 seconds after freshman Sammi Burgess scored UF’s second point of the night.
Florida faces High Point on 
Saturday, a team known for hav-
ing a unique, but difficult de-
fense. Florida spent most of its time on offense against JU, put-ting little pressure on the defense 
that North Carolina eviscerated.O’Leary said that even though 
the crowd did not get to see how the defense would play after the 
loss against UNC, she believes that if the team manages the game well and communicates 
properly on the field, than the 
defense should have no issue on Saturday.
While Stevens and Gilroy put 
up a combined total of 10 points, 
Devon Schneider (four points) 
and Sam Darcangelo (three points) also bolstered Florida’s offense.
“We knew we had the poten-
tial to be really good,” Darcan-gelo said. 
“We just need to work togeth-
er like we have been, get ground 
balls, play hard on defense, 1-v-1 
and then go hard on the cage ev-ery single time.”

Senior’s floor routine similar to last year’s
“I have — I guess you could say — a 
fragile body, and so they’re very smart 
with when to put me in all around and 
when to put in on floor or on vault.” 
For her 2014 floor routine, Johnson 
uses the same passes as the 2013 routine 
she competed only two times, but she uses different dance moves. 
Johnson even uses the same song 
from her 2013 floor routine, “Diva Song” from the Fifth Element, in her 2014 floor routine. 
Johnson’s 9.825 on floor Friday was 
not far behind her career best of 9.925, which she set against Penn State and NC State on Jan. 28, 2011. With five meets still left in the regular season and a like-
ly long run in the postseason, Johnson 
has a chance to break the record she set in her freshman year. 
But Johnson said Tuesday that she 
still was not sure if she would compete on floor or all-around in UF’s home meet against Arkansas on Friday. 
“I focus on what I need to correct from 
the previous meet and of course having 
fun; it’s my last year,” Johnson said. “So 
I don’t really focus on the scores or try-ing to beat the score from the previous competition. I just focus on the correc-
tions that the coaches give me and hav-
ing a good time.” gym , from page 14

As teammate Dorian Finney-
Smith and Tennessee forward Jar-
nell Stokes battled for a rebound off a missed jumper, Patric Young put his body on the line late in Tuesday night’s game.
Taking a move out of Dennis Rod-
man’s repertoire, Young bolted for the offensive board and dove head-
ﬁ  rst for the ball before Stokes or An-
tonio Barton could come up with it.
Before he slid out of bounds on 
the right baseline, the senior center gained possession and threw the ball to Kasey Hill as Florida wasted time on a fresh shot clock with a 61-55 lead and just more than a minute left in regulation.
Young’s grit down the stretch 
helped No. 3 Florida shake its recent woes in Knoxville, Tenn., and knock off Tennessee 67-58.
The full-out dive by Young, who had four fouls at the time, was per-haps the most impactful play of the game and one of his best in his career at Florida.
To coach Billy Donovan, Young’s 
offensive rebound was the “play of the year.”
“He sold out,” Donovan said. 
“Two guys were in front of him. He ran past and made an incredible save and helped us come up with the loose basketball.
“It was an incredible play by him 
effort-wise with four fouls.”
What proved to be the gem of 
the game happened after a series of missed shots by the Gators. After point guard Scottie Wilbekin drove 
down the lane and came up empty af-
ter wasting 31 seconds of clock with 
1:40 left, Tennessee forward Jeronne Maymon kept the ball in bounds by chucking it over his head.
Young then came up with posses-
sion.With the shot clock about to ex-
pire, Young quickly pulled up for a jumper — a shot he rarely takes — 
on the elbow. The attempt clanked 
off the rim, and then the senior cen-
ter chased for it to make his hustle 
play.
In 23 minutes of action, Young 
ﬁ  nished with six points on 3-of-7 shooting and six boards — with ﬁ  ve 
coming on the offensive end. The se-
nior’s offensive rebounding success Tuesday night helped Florida out-
rebound a physical Tennessee team 
39-32 and win the battle on the of-
fensive glass 18-9.
“Jarnell and Maymon, they’re 
the best rebounders probably in our 
league,” Young said. “We knew we 
had to go in there and bleed and battle and ﬁ  ght and bite and scratch and scar and come up with some loose balls.”
That type of desperation was em-
bodied by Young’s loose-ball dive.
Although it was not a play ﬂ  ashy 
enough to crack SportsCenter’s Top 10, it proved to be the dagger in Tuesday night’s contest.Young’s rebound ensures UF victory
