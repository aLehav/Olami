New leaders of SG organizations like Ac-
cent Speakers Bureau and Student Govern-
ment Productions will be chosen tonight.The SG Executive Board — which consists 
of the Student Body president, vice president, treasurer, Senate President and Senate Presi-dent Pro-Tempore — selected 43 candidates for agencies, secretaries and cabinets after weeks of deliberation. The Replacement and Agenda committee voted Monday to recom-mend them, and the list of nominees will go 
before the Student Senate tonight.Student Body treasurer 
Elliot Grasso said about 
150 people applied over-all. When choosing who to recommend, Grasso said the board looked for experi-ence, knowledge and quali-
ﬁ  cations.
Appointments to Accent and SGP have historically caused controversy. They control a total of about $1.2 million in student funds, and they are typically among the few SG ofﬁ  cials who receive salaries.
Debate is common at Spring Senate meet-
ings where the recommendations are ratiﬁ  ed.

� RESIDENTS GIVEN 24-HOUR NOTICE, 
FINES.

Students commonly hide their pets from land-
lords and apartment complexes without conse-
quence, but one student-living complex is cracking down. 
Some residents at The Estates received pet-evic-
tion notices recently after management conducted property furniture inspections.
Residents were given a 24-hour notice to re-
move their pets from the premises and a $250 ﬁ  ne.
Lily Svete, a 23-year-old UF biology and psy-
chology senior, said she brought her German shep-herd Baylee as a puppy in the Fall and thought it would be OK to keep her at the complex because she’d seen other residents with similar dogs.
“They have never enforced this rule before,” 
she said. “I never knew it was a rule. I’m from In-diana, so I can’t just take my dog home.”
Baylee, who weighs 63 pounds, exceeds the 
fewer-than-35-pound pet requirement at the com-plex. The requirements also prohibit aggressive breeds like pit bulls.
To register pets, tenants must provide proof of 
pet records, written consent from apartment room-
mates and pay a $150 nonrefundable fee and a $20 
addition to monthly rent.
Gina Cowart, spokeswoman for The Estates, 
wrote in an email that once the pet is approved, 
management takes a picture of it and adds the pet to the lease.  
“It has been a long standing lease term at the 
Estates and some might say a standard for many apartment communities that all pets must be reg-
istered through the leasing ofﬁ  ce prior to being al-
lowed on the property,” she said.  
Svete said she was given until May to move 
Baylee. But some residents, like Lilly Kennedy, Secret pets get 
eviction notices at The Estates

EMILY COCHRANE

Proposed government regulations 
may make it harder for UF musicians 
and faculty to showcase their art out-side of the country.
The Obama administration recently 
announced new legislation that would ban the transport of ivory in and out of the country as a way to reduce the glob-al demand for ivory and the subsequent slaughter of African elephants.
The legislation should be in effect by the end of June, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.
Though the UF music school’s study 
abroad program in Salzburg, Austria, has had little to no trouble with musi-cians bringing their instruments on in-ternational ﬂ  ights, the proposed legisla-tion could change that, particularly for the string instruments.
Because most string musicians prefer 
the sound of older instruments made be-fore a 1989 ivory ban, many bows have 
a small triangle of ivory at the tip of the 
bow holding the hair in place.
Charlene Sertel, a representative at 
Gainesville Violins, said although the process is a bit involved, the ivory can be replaced for about $120.
“You have to get the whole bow re-
haired in order to replace the tip with Laws could impact musicians’ travel abroad

As people grow older, they tend 
to forget simple aspects of life, like 
what they need to buy at the grocery 
store or where they parked their cars — an inevitable effect of aging.
A team of UF researchers is test-
ing a drug therapy that might help 
reverse the decline of working memory in seniors. 
Working memory is the ability to 
hold information in your mind for a short period of time, said Jennifer 
Bizon, an associate professor in the 
UF College of Medicine.
The drug is being tested on rats 
in research laboratories at the UF College of Medicine, but it is not yet 
ready for human use. Barry Setlow, a collaborator on 
the research project and an associate 
professor in the UF College of Medi-cine, said he has been doing research concerning cognitive functions in rodent models for about 20 years.
He said he found that older rats, 
like older people, have a harder time completing working memory tasks like remembering which lever they 
chose after a short time period.
Setlow said he and the other re-
searchers find it particularly exciting 
that they can potentially reverse the memory decline in the aging brain.
To target the specific problem, 
they want to use this drug therapy.
“That is sort of the light at the end 
of the tunnel,” he said. “But there’s a 
long way to go. This is really just a 
first step.”
The results of their research were 
published in March in an issue of the Journal of Neuroscience.
In the future, however, the drug 
will most likely not be used in hu-mans with Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementias, Bizon 
said.
“A lot of people are concerned 
about Alzheimer’s disease, and they 
should be because it is a very dev-astating disease.” Bizon said. “But a 
lot of people also are not going to get 
Alzheimer’s, and they’re still going to have memory problems that re-ally significantly impair their qual-
ity of life.” Grant Simpson, a 23-year-old UF 
biochemistry and behavioral and 
cognitive neuroscience senior, is the research co-chair for the UF Neuro-science Club. He said the research focuses on a valuable topic.
“Age and population are explod-
ing, so it’s important that we address these concerns,” Simpson said.

Kennedy, a 22-year-old UF Spanish 
and linguistics senior, said she had to 
have her roommate drive her 4-year-
old Labrador mix, Roscoe, back home to Orlando. She said management told her that more than 100 tenants received the same notice she did.
Complex management changed ear-
lier this semester, she said, which may have led to the pet crackdown.
“The leasing manager admitted that the old management did not enforce these rules,” Kennedy said.

Gainesville Police arrested a UF student af-
ter officers reported the student crashed into 
a pole while drunk driving, causing about $3,500 of damage.
Officers arrested 21-year-old Cody Daw-
son Creagan on charges of DUI damage to property and leaving the scene of an accident, according to an arrest report. 
At about 4:45 p.m. Sunday, a witness called 
911 to report a white BMW that hit a pole on Northwest Sixth Avenue and drove off. The caller said the pole was tipping over, accord-ing to the report. 
Officers later found the car in the 1800 block 
of Northwest Sixth Avenue. Creagan was in the driver’s seat while the passenger checked the car for damage, according to the report. When the officer asked for a driver’s license, 
Creagan handed him a debit card. According to the report, he said, “My life is f*****. I had too many Mimosas at lunch. I didn’t realize I was intoxicated.”
Creagan could not perform all of the field 
sobriety tests and would not provide a breath sample, according to the report. During ques-tioning, he refused to comment. 
He also declined to comment to an Alliga-
tor reporter Monday night.
Officers booked Creagan into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 7:46 p.m. Sunday. He was released the following afternoon. UF student arrested on DUI charges after crashing into pole
Renting instruments could be plan B
bone ivory,” Sertel said. “The whole process takes about two weeks.”
For Steven Thomas, a UF cello 
professor who spends many weeks 
annually performing as a chamber 
musician across the U.S. and China, the ban is one more reason to bor-row a cello for his performances.
“My feeling is if an old bow has 
ivory already there, just let it be,” Thomas said. 
He  said he will borrow at least six cellos on his next trip. 
“Most of the time, I borrow in-
struments because I’m just so sick of the whole system,” he said. “It’s just a real pain in the neck.”
But Thomas said he’s not too 
concerned about the ramifications of the new legislation because this 
isn’t the first time instrument ma-
terial has been an issue.
“Bows are made out of perman-
buco wood, and the same thing happened with this, where the per-manbuco wood was not allowed to cross borders,” Thomas said. “This was going to destroy music. But legislatures were told that this was going to be destructive to the music industry, and the issue was resolved within a decade.”
Leisa Miller, an 18-year-old 
UF linguistics freshman, said she doesn’t plan to take her violin on a plane after hearing about the pos-
sible restrictions.
“Even though mine doesn’t 
have ivory, it makes me wonder if 
there’s another rule I don’t know about,” Miller said. “My instru-ment is really dear and valuable to me, and I don’t want it confis-cated.”

Student groups from UF 
and other Florida universi-
ties conducted a sit-in out-side Florida Senate President Don Gaetz’s office Monday 
to demand a floor vote for SB 
1400.
The bill, which would al-
low certain undocumented students in-state tuition, suffered a setback Thursday when Senate Appropriation Chairman Joe Negron refused to hear the bill. Supporters of 
the bill are pressuring Gaetz 
to use his position to move the bill forward.
The delay has angered 
several student groups and divided the Republican lead-ership.
“The goal of the sit-in is to 
hold Gaetz to (his) promise 
he made not to block (the) bill 
from (a) fair vote,” said Col-leen Baublitz, a UF environ-mental engineering student and member of Students for a Democratic Society.
Gaetz expressed his con-
cern for the legislation in an email to his constituents.
“(The bill) casts a blanket 
of approval over non-citi-zens who are in this country without proper legal status from anywhere in the world, including countries which are caldrons of terrorism and anti-American violence,” he wrote.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush 
advocated for the bill, ac-
cording to a news release, 
and said, “Punishing some students for their parents’ act by creating obstacles to a college degree isn’t in their interests or ours. I urge the Florida Senate to do the right thing for our state and Pass SB 1400.”
Students, like Mariana 
Castro, a 19-year-old UF in-terdisciplinary studies neu-robiological science fresh-man who attended the sit-in, are outraged by Gaetz’s inac-tion.
“We’ve gotten this far,” 
she said, calling the move 
“cowardly.”
But supporters have found 
a workaround with Sen. Jack 
Latvala, a sponsor of the bill, who they say intends to at-tach SB 1400 as an amend-ment to other education bills that the appropriations com-mittee intends to hear.
Students for a Democratic 
Society lead organizer Chris-ley Carpio said she thanks Latvala “for being outspoken even (in the) face of opposi-tion from his own party.”Students hold sit-in to 
demand tuition equity
pEtS, from page 1100 tenants received notesAEPi, Theta Chi often picked
within certain fraternities. Past articles in the 
Gainesville Sun (2010) and the Alligator (2005) drew similar conclusions. In both stories, SG officials denied favoritism.  
Recent Alligator research revealed 22 of the 
past 25 Accent chairmen have been members of UF’s Alpha Epsilon Pi chapter. The recom-mended 2014-2015 candidate, Corey Flayman, is also in AEPi, according to his application.
UF Theta Chi’s website says 10 brothers 
have been SGP chairmen, and Alligator re-search confirmed that for the past six years, a Theta Chi brother has led the agency. An ex-ception was in 2011-2012, when there were two chairmen — one was in Theta Chi, and the 
other was in Phi Delta Theta.This year, two students have been recom-
mended as co-chairs for SGP: Theta Chi broth-
er Bradley Wheeler and Tau Epsilon Pi brother Jonathan Schonfeld. 
Grasso said the board does not look at house 
affiliations for executive positions but rather 
candidates’ experience and ideas. 
“For Accent, there was only one applicant,” 
he said. “You can’t base allegations on the ap-
plicant pool if the only applicant is AEPi.” 
Grasso said the positions were well-adver-
tised and open to all students. Overall, six posi-tions were left open. 
Senate President Pro-Tempore Joseph Mi-
chaels said some, like the Innovation Academy 
cabinet director and technology executive sec-
retary, had no applicants. For other vacant po-sitions, Michaels said the board kept the spots available for more qualified applicants.SEnA tE , from page 1LOcAL

Two serious attacks and an un-
precedented rise in the animal’s 
population have caused a recent bear scare among Floridians.
The bears that mauled Terri Fra-
na in Lake Mary on April 14 and Susan Chalfant in Longwood on Dec. 2 raised questions and debate about the potential danger of bears in other populated areas such as Gainesville.
Last month, the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission held a public meeting at Gainesville City Hall to discuss future manage-
ment of Florida’s largest land mam-
mal. The Florida black bear’s swell-ing numbers moved it off the state’s threatened species list in 2012. Since then, its population has continued to rise along with sightings.
Commission spokeswoman 
Karen Parker said because Flori-da’s bear population and human 
population are both increasing, the 
chance of an encounter is higher.
“We’re not talking about Dis-
ney animals here,” she said. “We’re talking about wildlife that can hurt 
you.”
Parker said they get more calls 
to the wildlife alert hotline during 
the spring when mating season causes the animals to roam.“We’re coming across these 
bears ... that are showing some disconcerting behaviors,” she said. “(They’re) coming right up to peo-ple like ‘Hey give me a ham sand-wich.’”Since the most recent attack, the 
commission has killed seven black bears they deemed as “habitual-ized,” meaning the animals have lost their fear of humans.
Some Floridians can’t bear it anymore. People are asking the 
commission to move bears away 
from neighborhoods instead of kill-ing them, according to a web peti-tion written by Mark Marhon Jr. of Groveland, Fla., and electronically signed by about 1,000 supporters.
“Unfairly baiting and extermi-
nating bears is animal cruelty with no justifiable end,” Marhon said in 
the petition.
Samantha Wisely, a UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation profes-
sor, said she has seen years of re-search prove that relocating prob-lem bears does nothing but relocate the problem. 
The bears will either travel long 
distances back to the known food 
source or find another neighbor-
hood to hassle for a handout.
“If you have a bear behave in a 
bad way, it has to be euthanized.” she said, “That’s why a fed bear is a dead bear.”
With the recent bear increase, 
Floridians are starting to become more aware of the issue.
In Gainesville, a bear was found 
roaming the Kirkwood subdivision last year, according to Alligator ar-chives. Parker said the incident did not end in harm to either party be-cause the commission educated the neighborhood.
“It did work, and it was because 
of the community’s effort,” Parker 
said. “And that’s what we like to 
see.”TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A music video made by a UF student has gone viral, 
resulting in malicious personal attacks. 
Kira Silverman, a 20-year-old UF psychology and Eng-
lish sophomore, starred in a parody to the beat of Lorde’s 
“Royals” about the rivalry between UF and Florida State 
University. 
“The music video is a satire of the entire rivalry in gen-
eral,” Silverman wrote in an email.
She said the video, which has received more than 
150,000 views since it was posted on April 11, was cre-
ated to promote Generation Sketch Comedy’s show this semester. An FSU student posted a response video Saturday, 
titled “FSU Loyals.” At press time, it had about 17,000 views. 
“This was not intended to be a serious jab at FSU,” Sil-
verman said. “It was a basic song that we thought would appeal to our friends and other students in order to draw 
them to our show.” 
Silverman said she wrote the song in about 10 minutes 
after someone at the Generation Sketch Comedy rehears-
als mentioned that the organization hadn’t created any-thing about the UF/FSU rivalry in a while.
In the video, Silverman is seen dancing on campus and 
singing the lyrics she wrote to Lorde’s tune.
“It seemed like she was focused on Gatorade, like that 
is all there is to be proud of,” said Shelby Beauchamp, a 19-year-old FSU family and child sciences sophomore.
Among what she referred to as the “most basic elements 
of the rivalry,” Silverman juxtaposed the universities’ col-ors, chants, girls and soda brands.

“I think if she had a little more peer review it would’ve 
been a better idea,” Ruben said. “I hope it doesn’t hurt her. She seems harmless.”  
Silverman said most of the negative responses have 
been “less about the video and song and more personal attacks on (her) appearance and talent.”
She said she hasn’t been responding to the vicious “at-

� PARISLEAF WON AN AWARD 
FOR ITS GREENPEACE WORK.

A local business is celebrating Earth 
Day with a large contribution. Parisleaf, 
a local Gainesville design and printing firm, donated 1,000 trees to a Maryland-based agroforestry charity called Trees 
for the Future.
Parisleaf online community manager 
Jen Coleman said the business chose to 
donate to the charity because it plants fruit-bearing trees in low resource areas that suffer from deforestation and un-sustainable agricultural systems.
Parisleaf recently won an American 
Advertising award for working with its client, Greenpeace — a non-governmen-tal environmental organization. Cole-man said the company donated the trees after receiving the award as a way to cel-ebrate the achievement.
Maria Espinosa, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations junior, said Earth Day is 
a day to celebrate natural resources.
“It’s a way for us to appreciate what 
we have on Earth and realize there are 
ways to help conserve it,” she said.Local design business

A new iPhone and Android application 
aims to slash buzzed driving among college 
students.
Watch Your BAC is a free mobile app that 
helps track blood alcohol content. Users input their information to calculate their BAC or the time it will take to sober up.
Miné Salkin, the spokeswoman for Type 
2 Designs, the company that created the app, said friends can connect through each other’s phones to group chat, monitor each other’s alcohol levels and choose a designated driver. Users who use the app often and act as the des-ignated driver frequently earn achievement no-tifications that their friends can see. 
“For many students and young people of (college) age, it’s the first time in their lives that they are making independent choices as adults,” Salkin wrote in an email. “We hope this app, used as a guideline, will help them make educated and informed choices.”
The app also comes loaded with phone 
numbers of local taxi companies.
Dane Albér, a 21-year-old UF psychology 
senior, said he thought the app was a good idea but isn’t sure if it will be always be effective.
“I just don’t know if you can expect a drunk 
person to keep track of what they drink,” he wrote in an email. “Ultimately, if someone is too drunk to drive, they won’t be able to use the app effectively.”New BAC app creates local buzz

Wanted: Summer 
2014 columnists 
and cartoonists
Summer is coming, and you could spend it any old boring 
way — loaﬁ  ng around your hometown, toiling away in Summer classes, working your butt off at an internship 
or backpacking through Europe on a cliched mission for self discovery. 
Or you could apply to write a weekly column for the largest 
student-run newspaper in the U.S.!
The Alligator prints biweekly during Summer semesters — 
Tuesdays and Thursdays — and is looking for highly opinion-ated Carl Hiaasens, Maureen Dowds or Dave Barrys to inform, educate and aggravate our readers with well-written columns about — well, whatever you want. 
Whether you’re a political aﬁ  cionado or a pop-culture 
junkie, we want to hear from you. The best part is, you don’t 
necessarily have to be in Gainesville. Our regular columnists 
usually submit their copies through email, so if you’re holed up at home in, say, Tampa or writing from your tablet on the beaches of Cancun, you’re still eligible to contribute columns. 
If you’re interested in becoming a columnist, you should 
submit a resume, a brief cover letter explaining why you’d be a good ﬁ  t for the position and a short explanation of your po-litical persuasion — conservative, liberal, libertarian, socialist, etc., to opinions@alligator.org. The deadline to apply is May 
11 — Mother’s Day. Only UF and Santa Fe College students are 
eligible for columnist positions, which are unpaid.
Please keep in mind that Republican and Democrat are par-
ties, not ideologies.
If you have been previously published or keep a blog, 
please send three examples of your work. If you have not been published before, you may send two 500- to 600-word writ-ing samples demonstrating what your work for the Alligator would be like.
Applicants should be able to produce articulate, thought-
provoking analyses and commentary on current events. Any-thing is fair game: domestic and foreign politics, pop culture, health, environmental issues, personal ﬁ  nance, sex and rela-tionships, issues facing minority communities and campus and local politics.
We’re looking for strong writers familiar with basic ele-
ments of style and who have a passion for deadlines and AP Style. A sharp sense of humor helps; after all, you’ll catch more 
ﬂ  ies with one-liners than with vitriol. 
And if you don’t make the cut? Never fear! We still strongly 
encourage you to submit guest columns and letters to the edi-
tor. If you have questions about submitting guest columns or letters to the editor, feel free to email opinions@alligator.org.

Avenue construction affect you? Today’s question: Have you ever driven while drunk?My ﬁ  nal remarks: A call for honesty
On Wednesday, The New York Times ran a front-page 
story detailing how Florida State University and Tal-lahassee Police had left multiple rape allegations, 
including the one against star quarterback Jameis Winston, uninvestigated. 
Deep in the article, I found a heartbreaking quote from 
one rape victim. The student said in her complaint to TPD, “Why was I not given an advocate to speak with? I was raped and was stressed and scared.”    
How could a police department make a rape victim feel 
so helpless? Tallahassee, like many other college towns, is notorious for trying to keep rape cases on the down-low. If that’s the case, are the police ofﬁ  cers in Tallahassee somehow uniquely immoral? 
Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “I am ashamed to think 
how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to large soci-eties and dead institutions.” This idea that our moral com-passes don’t function well under social pressure explains why FSU, with its obsessive sports culture, didn’t take the charges against its star quarterback seriously. 
The same holds true for all aspects of life. Often our grav-
est concerns, whether they have to do with a Greek organiza-tion, a respected family member or an inﬂ  uential group of 
leaders, get completely ignored. Why? For one reason: Once 
someone or something becomes part of the “establishment,” it’s harder to level charges against that someone/something. 
The true moral dilemma for many of our problems, rang-
ing from the interpersonal to the societal, has to do with the value we attach to people. In an ideal community, individu-als — not institutions — are sacrosanct. 
Before bashing institutions and other social groups, Em-
erson paid his highest respects to the singular human being, 
saying that each of us represents a unique “divine idea.” We 
came to existence to bring to fruition a unique part of the overall divine blueprint, but the true expression comes only through self-respecting our individuality. 
The greatest calamity in our time has been society’s push 
toward impassivity. Even health care professionals are urged today not to get “emotionally attached” to their patients, while the aloofness of our politicians and pundits has led to serious human struggles becom-ing abstract subjects of intellectual jousting at the dinner table. 
The most common piece of ad-
vice dispensed today is to “grow 
a thicker skin,” but do we real-
ize that desensitization leads to a more tragic end? 
Rarely do we ﬁ  nd a person to-
day who has no “skin” — someone 
whose unadulterated, moral individuality calls for outrage even when society sits back with apathy and the occasional bewilderment. 
But where do we ﬁ  nd moral clarity? 
Real honesty, as Emerson put it, can only be found within 
individuals, not in groups. 
“These are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they 
grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society 
everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members… The virtue in most request is confor-mity… It loves not realities and creators, but names and cus-toms,” Emerson cautioned. 
This explains why, when a bold sorority member dares to 
speak her mind against her repressive climate, she is quickly labeled “un-sisterly” and accused of not showing respect to her superiors and loyalty to her peers. 
On the other hand, if we began pledging loyalty to our in-
dividual selves and to that slice of divinity within each of us, we would consider each others’ moral honesty as more sa-cred, and ultimately more helpful, than the self-proclaimed values social groups pretend to possess. 
Those rare moments when we conﬁ  dently express our-
selves, undeterred by others’ inﬂ  uences and are completely honest with each other are what justify our existence. 
The inﬁ  nitely fertile words of the Quran speak to this 
moral axiom: “Mankind is in loss, except those who believe and do good, and enjoin on each other Truth, and enjoin on each other Patience.”

When I was getting ready to go to 
college four years ago, I thought I had it all ﬁ  gured out. With AP 
credits, I could have my degree in less than four years. I’d have internships every summer, tons of experience and a job offer before I crossed the stage. 
I remember when my parents left me 
in my room at Graham Hall with my life in boxes. It felt like the moment just after you’ve made it to the top of a roller coaster — you know all hell is going to break loose, but you’ll step off at the end unscathed. 
Four years later, I realize that college 
has been more like walking up stairs in the dark. At the end, you take that one extra step you thought was there, only to realize with sheer terror, there isn’t one. 
After I graduate, I’ll be staying here 
working the same part-time job that kept me aﬂ  oat the past few years. I didn’t get those internships. And while half of me wants to sink into full-blown quar-ter-life crisis mode, the rest is slowly realizing that it’s all ﬁ  ne. 
Throughout our lives, we’re 
forced into the next step con-stantly. Every single action we take is meant for some ultimate end. In school, it’s usually college, and in college, the goal is usually a job. Society constantly puts pressure on us all to follow this rigid roadmap for success. If you don’t, you just won’t make it. 
But maybe there’s more to pressure 
than deadlines. Maybe success isn’t mea-sured in material accomplishments but by how wide your smile is at the end of the day. 
I’ve always thought that 
having balance was the most important thing in life. Four years of college has only rein-forced that belief. 
It’s important to ﬁ  nish ev-
erything you need to. It’s im-portant to work, to practice and to perfect. But it’s just as 
important to play, to relax and to appreci-ate what you’ve done. Some people think that puts you behind. But in the end, you’ll be far, far ahead. 
No, I’m not graduating with an amazing 
journalism job in D.C. — not even one in Gainesville. For the past few months, I’ve been asking myself if this means four years of my life have gone down the drain. 
I could have gone to a number of col-leges all over the country and studied anything I wanted. But coming to UF and studying journalism was the greatest deci-sion I ever made. 
Over everything, it taught me that you 
are the only person who knows if you’re on the right path. Everyone tries to dictate what the right way to go is. But everyone has different circumstances, and no one is more qualiﬁ  ed to tell you what you should be doing than yourself. 
I don’t know what happens next. I do 
know that these past four years have pre-pared me for anything. No one makes it out of life alive, so the best thing to do is to stop taking it so seriously. 
After I graduate, I will be happy. Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His

Senior reality check: College is like walking upstairs in the darkColumn

I have written frequently in the 
past about how corporations and wealthy interests exert a 
disproportionate inﬂ  uence over the policies of the American federal 
government. Now that inﬂ  uence 
has been conﬁ  rmed by an exten-sive, major academic study.
The study, conducted by North-
western University professor Ben-jamin Page and Princeton University professor Martin Gilens, found that democracy has es-sentially ceased to exist at the federal level of American politics.
Gilens and Page studied nearly 1,800 policy 
issues between 1982 and 2002 and found that policies generally supported by the rich have a 45-percent chance of becoming law, while those largely supported by the middle class only have an 18-percent likelihood of taking effect.
They sum up the current American political 
system concisely: “When a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with or-
ganized interests, they generally lose.”
The professors argue that American politics 
more closely represent an oligarchy, in which 
political power is wielded by a small group of elites rather than a traditional representative democracy.
The dominance of wealthy elites in Ameri-
can politics has resulted in government policy that favors the ultra-wealthy over everyone 
else. In recent years, this condition has become 
more extreme.
According to a study from the University of 
California-Berkeley, 95 percent of all economic 
gains in the U.S. between 2009 and 2012 went to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. 
The recent Supreme Court rulings in Citi-
zens United v. FEC and McCutcheon v. FEC have allowed wealthy interests to exert even 
more inﬂ  uence on American politics. These de-
cisions allowed nearly unlimited spending by the political action committees of corporations and unions on political advertising and cam-paign contributions.
The control that corporate and wealthy inter-
ests exert over American politics threatens the fundamental American principle of represen-tative democracy. Politicians rely on wealthy 
donors to bankroll their increasingly expensive 
campaigns and then must serve these wealthy interests to ensure their own political survival.
Those who support unlimited private cam-paign contributions often argue that the inﬂ  uence of money in poli-tics is minimal. After all, they say, votes are what ultimately determine the winner of any election, not the 
amount of campaign contributions.
However, this is a vast oversim-
pliﬁ  cation of the modern system of 
American politics. The news media tends to give more extensive and 
prominent coverage to those candidates who raise the most money. In fact, the candidate who raises the most money wins  about 93 per-cent of the time.
In addition, those who raise money from 
wealthy interests have a massive advantage in primary elections over less well-ﬁ  nanced candi-dates. 
Although votes still determine the winners 
of elections, the choices voters have are severely constricted by the role wealthy interests play in selecting candidates for both parties. Ameri-cans often face a choice between two candidates 
who are each supported by campaign donations 
from wealthy interests. 
Democrats generally do a much better job 
of representing the needs and interests of or-dinary Americans than do Republicans. The positions of the Democratic Party on issues like minimum wage, taxes and health care generally align more closely with those of the majority of Americans.
However, many of the Democratic Party’s 
leaders are also beholden to the inﬂ  uence of 
moneyed interests. The desire of these leaders 
to preserve the political status quo, which large-ly beneﬁ  ts these wealthy campaign donors, is a critical roadblock in the path of substantive po-litical change.
For ordinary Americans to wrest control 
of their government from the wealthy elites, 
a Constitutional amendment banning private 
money in politics must be enacted. Until such an amendment is passed, our elected ofﬁ  cials will continue to favor the interests of their wealthy campaign donors over those of middle-class and working-class Americans. 
Unfortunately, such reforms are unlikely to 
come from members of Congress, who are cur-rently dependent on these private donations to 
preserve their own political power.

I could write the cli-
che, “These last four years were perfect,” 
but they were far from it. 
During my four years 
at UF, I lived through 
both the hardest and 
most wonderful times of my life. I suffered through loss and learned more outside the lec-tures halls than I did inside. I be-
came a different person, and there 
is beauty in that. 
Two years ago, I hated journal-
ism. I got involved with the Alli-
gator as a contributing writer in 
Spring 2013 because I was trying to get articles published for extra credit in a required reporting class. I would write stories for school 
credit and just go through the 
motions —  until I covered Dance Marathon at the end of that semes-ter. There, I talked to a little boy 
named Zander who was born with 
a heart condition and was treated at UF Health Shands Hospital. He told me he has more friends in col-lege than in Kindergarten because 
of DM at UF. I couldn’t wait to 
share his story. That was a deﬁ  ning moment in my college career, and I decided I wanted to start working 
at the paper and eventually be able 
to tell the world about superheroes like Zander.
Unlike most of the graduating 
Alligator staff, I’ve only been at the 
paper for three semesters. I don’t 
even study journalism. But thanks to the emotional, stressed out, sleep-deprived, passionate, crazy, 
beautiful people at the Alligator, 
I’ve fallen in love with it. All of it — spending more time at the ofﬁ  ce than I do in my own home, the in-signiﬁ  cant pay, arguments about 
editorial decisions and ethics, the creepy opossums that 
greet me at the door at midnight, the shifts 
that often last until 1 
a.m. when I have to be on campus at 7 a.m., the stress of breaking 
news and even the 
people who trash the 
paper as a “liberal piece of sh*t.” 
I love those people. How bor-
ing would life be if everyone loved 
everything we published and our 
coverage never sparked discussion or debate?
I’m grateful for the Jimmy 
John’s delivery people who some-times make ﬁ  ve visits to the ofﬁ  ce in one night because there’s no time to leave for a dinner break. I’m grateful for Karma Cream be-
ing open until 1:30 in the morning 
because that chai tea runs through my bloodstream. 
In this industry, the competi-
tion is ﬁ  erce. The hours are long, late and often unpredictable. 
The job takes over your life, and 
you end up surviving on endless caffeine and fast food. The pay 
sucks. As a copy editor, you have 
nightmares about fact errors and comma splices. Yes, I’m serious. It’s far from glamorous.
So, why the hell would anyone 
want to do it? To tell people’s sto-ries that otherwise wouldn’t be heard. To inform people, hope-fully in an unbiased way, of what’s 
happening in their communities 
and the world, so they can make educated decisions. To make a dif-ference. 
At the end of the day, it’s worth 
it.

A UF alumnus ascended to the next level 
in a contest offering rising entrepreneurs a 
chance to climb Mount Kilimanjaro this June.
The contest is hosted by The Summit, a con-
ference in Dublin that brings technology lead-
ers, entrepreneurs and investors together. Five 
participants will be chosen to climb the moun-tain with business leaders and innovators in a partnership with Charity: Water, a nonprofit that brings safe drinking water to developing nations, to raise awareness for its cause.David Flores, who earned his master’s in 
entrepreneurship from UF in 2013, wants to win “to get to know these amazing guys who are movers and shakers at a global level.”
Flores submitted a video to earn a spot 
among the top 50 contestants. Those selected will meet a panel of judges in The Summit Kilimanjaro People’s Choice Final, where the finalists will be chosen.
The 29-year-old Santa Fe College profes-
sor said he will be a “natural fit,” if chosen. He founded Onward Development, a consult-ing company, and is an ambassador and web curator for the Gainesville Area Innovation Network, which establishes communications among startup companies.
“David is one of those startup superstars,” 
said Isabell Springer, founder of Drivers Ed for Love, a relationship education organization.
She said Flores was helping her compose a 
business pitch when he received the email no-
tification saying he made the second round.
“He was just thrilled,” she said. 
Lee May, executive director of the 
Gainesville Area Innovation Network, said Flores is a respected member of her organiza-tion. May, who climbed Mount Kilimanjaro about 15 years ago, said she would advise him to take his altitude-sickness medication when he makes the trek on the infamous mountain.
“I call it ‘Kill-A-Man-Dead-O,’” she said, 
“because it was brutal.”
May said she suffered from altitude sick-
ness during her climb, and an inspirational Sherpa helped maintain her spirit.
“In order to encourage me further, he start-
ed to sing me ‘Rock of Ages,’ in Swahili, and it just boomed through the mountain tops,” she said. “It gives me shivers just to think about it.”
May said she hopes Flores has the opportu-
nity to also experience this adventure.UF alumnus in competition to climb Mount Kilimanjaro

Gainesville Police arrested a 
local homeless woman Sunday 
evening after she beat a man with a dog leash then dumped beer on another woman’s head. 
Officers arrested 41-year-
old Alicia Chavez on charges of simple battery, resisting an officer, and hindering commu-nication to law enforcement, ac-cording to an arrest report. 
At about 5 p.m., Chavez 
grabbed a leash with a metal hook on the end at Southeast 
11th Avenue and swung it to-
ward a man, hitting him three times. The leash gave the man a large knot behind his left ear, 
according to the report.
When a woman told Chavez 
she was going to call 911, 
Chavez slammed the woman’s phone to the ground, took the beer the woman was holding out of her hand and poured it on her head. 
An officer later told Chavez 
to remain at the scene, and she took a “fighting stance,” ac-cording to the report. Officers placed Chavez in handcuffs and told her to sit down, but she refused. They then had to restrain her with a rip hobble and place her in the back of the police car, where she continued 
kicking. 
Officers booked Chavez into

Local roadwork conducted by the City of 
Gainesville’s Public Works department  is af-
fecting nearby businesses.
The resurfacing project began in Febru-
ary and will last until September. It’s taking 
place at the intersection of Archer Road and 
Southwest 16th Avenue and at Southwest 13th Street and Southwest 16th Avenue.
The project will cost about $1.8 million and 
was funded by the UF Campus Development Agreement, Regional Transit System spokes-man Chip Skinner wrote in an email.  
Brijesh Patel, store manager of Sai Kwik 
Stop, located at 1201 SW 16th Ave., said he noticed a difference in business the day con-struction began and hopes the work will be finished as soon as possible.
“Because of long traffic, nobody wants to pull in (to the shop),” he said. “... They didn’t give us a notice or anything.”
Project Manager Reid Rivers said he didn’t 
expect any inconveniences to businesses in the area. Most of the roadwork is near vacant buildings.
“The work is being done to improve safety 
and the capacity of the roadway,” he said.
Rivers said the project will include the 
removal of current on-street parking, the ad-dition of bike lanes, the replacement of two span-wire signals with mast-arm signals, roadway resurfacing and turn-lane enhance-ments from northbound Southwest 13th Street onto Southwest 16th Avenue.
“We are only working on the median be-
tween Steak ‘n Shake and CVS,” he said, “so it should be minimal.”
For some businesses, the construction may 
be helping.
“Business has picked up a little bit, believe 
it or not,” said Rasheed Khalif Barker, a server at Steak ‘n Shake at 1610 SW 13th St.
Rivers said although the work will require 
periodic daytime lane closures, no traffic im-pacts will be allowed during major holidays, UF home football games or times when heavy traffic is expected. Archer, 13th Street roadwork impacting local businesses
� IT’S KITTEN SEASON.

Alligator Contributing Writer
To celebrate kitten season, the 
Alachua County Humane Society is 
holding its first Kitten Shower at 2 p.m. Sunday at the shelter, 4205 NW Sixth St. 
Litters of strays flood into Alach-
ua County animal shelters from late spring until the end of summer. It is known as kitten season because it’s when outdoor cats begin reproduc-ing at extraordinary rates.
Humane society adoption and 
foster coordinator Chrissy Sedgley said the shelter received four litters of kittens two weeks ago, according to the humane society.
“It’s going to keep increasing more and more,” Sedgley said. 
The event’s purpose is to find 
homes for stray kittens.
Sedgley said the shelter relies 
on its foster network to wean aban-doned kittens so they are healthy enough to eventually be adopted.
“It’s pretty intensive,” Sedgley 
said. “They have to be fed every two hours. It’s around-the-clock work.”Berenice Jaramillo, 34, of Sara-
sota, said she fostered two kittens from the humane society when she attended UF seven years ago.
She rescued another cat from the 
same shelter three years later — a male brown tabby named Proton.
“I’ve rescued all of my pets from 
animal shelters,” she said. “There are too many that need good homes.”County humane society to host kitten shower on SundayThe climb will happen in June

Independently, Bertrhude Albert and 
Priscilla Zelaya energize classrooms. As a 
pair, they’re re-charging a nation’s teach-ers and illuminating the future for their students.  
The inseparable duo started a nonproﬁ  t, 
Projects for Haiti, during their junior year at UF after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.
For them, making a difference through 
donations only was not enough to help Al-bert’s country. Albert, a graduate student in Latin American studies, and Zelaya, a UF alumnus, are now inspiring Haitian teachers to make a difference one student 
at a time.
The two decided to start a teacher’s 
conference in Haiti for 60 Haitian teachers 
through the project, and this June it will be hosting its third conference with more than six times as many educators — about 405.
Zelaya, 25, said it will be the largest 
teacher conference in Haiti.
“They are the keys to unlocking the 
doors to success for their students,” she said. “They are the one’s leading the fu-ture presidents. It starts with them.”
About 17 U.S. teachers will travel with 
the Projects for Haiti team to host the conference. The four-day event features training sessions, keynote speakers and workshops on topics like special-needs 
education.
Donald DeVito, a special education 
teacher at the Sidney Lanier Center, will 
be providing trainings on inclusion during the conference. Thanks to the Projects for Haiti conference, he said, he will be able to inform more teachers on the importance of special education.
“Projects for Haiti isn’t a one-time 
thing,” he said. “It’s something that is be-ing built consistently and effectively over time to where you will have real change.”  
Albert and Zelaya’s idea has motivated 
Haitian teachers to create similar confer-ences for each other. After attending the project’s ﬁ  rst conference, Haitian teachers 
formed a teachers association to network and collaborate with teachers in different 
cities. The nonproﬁ  t was able to provide BlackBerry phones to the teachers in the association to help them stay connected, Albert said.
To foster more collaboration, the duo 
also created Teachers Affecting the Globe to connect Gainesville and Haitian teach-ers.
But the nonproﬁ  t is not only growing in Haiti. It’s also spreading its mission 
throughout Gainesville.
Through its 10K Connected initiative, 
the project is reaching out to Gainesville 
students. With 50-minute interactive pre-sentations, Albert and Zelaya hope to con-nect 10,000 local students to Haiti. Since October, the pair has given presentations on social justice advocacy, international development and poverty to more than 
2,000 students.
Albert said their goal is not for students 
to fall in love with Haiti, but for them to 
realize that there is a problem they can be the solution to.
“Age shouldn’t determine whether a 
person is socially aware,” Albert, 23, said.
Zelaya’s own students are learning 
about Haiti, too. Zelaya teaches second 
grade at Joseph Williams Elementary 
School. She said she keeps a Haitian ﬂ  ag in her classroom and incorporates as much culture as she can into her lessons. 
Zelaya said working with the Haitian 
teachers made her more creative with her teaching. During one conference, a teacher demonstrated an alternative method of teaching math by using rocks.
“Some of the teachers in Haiti go 
months without getting paid, and they’re still at their job every single day with the 
same passion and love for their students,” 
she said.
Before Projects for Haiti spreads outside 
of Gainesville and Haiti to Zelaya’s coun-try of Nicaragua, Albert said they need to establish themselves ﬁ  rmly ﬁ  rst and reach their 10,000-student goal.
With their energy and hope for Haiti, 
expansion doesn’t seem too far down the 
road for the two best friends who live, 
laugh and work together.
“Petit à petit, l’oiseau fait son nid,” they 
recited in unison. “Little by little, the bird makes its nest.”TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

UF sophomore gymnast Bridget Sloan was among the four finalists for the Honda Award, which is given to the top female athlete in each of the 12 NCAA sanctioned women’s sports. Sloan won the award in 2013.ERICA A. HERNANDEZ 
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa 
Fresh off the plane from Birmingham, 
Ala., Florida gymnastics coach Rhonda Faehn addressed the media for the final time 
of the 2014 season on Monday morning. 
After a wild finish Saturday at the NCAA 
Super Six that saw Florida tie for the nation-al title with Oklahoma, she had a clear mes-sage to deliver. 
“That’s the mark of a tremendous mental 
competitor — when the biggest pressure is on, they deliver and that’s exactly what she did,” Faehn said of Bridgette Caquatto, who 
tied her career high of 9.950 on floor to give 
UF a share of the title.
Faehn admitted there was some confu-
sion as to whether the tie would be broken 
after the team saw Caquatto’s score had tied 
the Gators with the Sooners, but she said she 
and the rest of the team were happy to share 
the first-place spot on the podium. 
Faehn explained the team’s toughest task 
this season was maintaining health. 
“For myself as a coach and our coaching 
staff, that was definitely the greatest chal-lenge in managing the health of the ath-letes,” Faehn said. 
“Knowing from the very beginning of 
the season that we lost a tremendous senior 
class, we had a smaller freshman class com-
ing in and we had sustained injuries that was season-ending for Kiersten Wang, who 
we were fully expecting to be a huge compo-
nent of our floor and vault lineup.” 
From Florida’s first meet against UCLA 
to its final meet on Saturday, the lineup was virtually identical with the exception of mi-nor adjustments in gymnast order.
“It was a very delicate situation with our 
lineups in that they had to stay healthy the entire year,” Faehn said. “We were able to shuffle them slightly when we had other athletes coming back like Jamie Shisler com-ing back from her injury and her surgery in the fall.”
Shisler competed on vault (9.825) once 
against West Virginia on March 7, and she exhibitioned four times on floor starting at the end of January. 
Another unexpected look for Florida was 
having junior Rachel Spicer in any of the first three spots on vault, balance beam and floor. Faehn said the junior battled the entire season with severe Achilles tendonitis. 
“Literally, I never told anybody, but I 
was afraid to watch her punch every time she took off on the floor because I thought, ‘What if her Achilles tears?’” Faehn said.

Florida’s bats are alive. 
Since its nine-game win streak began on 
April 4, No. 5 UF has outscored its opponents by a score of 65-15 while posting a .341 batting average.
In its road sweep of Texas A&M this week-
end, Florida had a .400 clip at the plate with 36 hits, including nine home runs.
“More than anything, give the kids credit 
for really coming out and putting in some good swings,” coach Tim Walton said follow-ing the series-ending contest. 
“Stephanie Tofft, Kelsey Stewart had phenomenal weekends, so there’s a lot of good weekends. Katie Me-
dina had a really nice week-
end. So just good for every-body, a good team win.”
Tofft hit a home run in 
each of the Gators’ games 
against the Aggies while batting .700 and bringing in a team-best 10 RBIs, which earned her the Southeastern Conference Player of the Infield leading UF offense

LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
In the absence of Derrick Rose 
this season, Joakim Noah has 
flourished for the Chicago Bulls. 
The former Gators center is in 
the midst of his best NBA season 
and has been the driving force and 
emotional leader behind the Bulls’ 
run to a No. 4 seed in the Eastern 
Conference. The NBA rewarded Noah for his efforts Monday, naming him the Defensive Player of the Year for the first time in his seven seasons with Chicago. 
Noah and Michael Jordan are 
the only Bulls to ever win the award, as Jordan picked up the 
honor in 1988. 
“This is very humbling to be 
in this situation right now,” Noah 
said Monday during his award 
presentation. 
“But this award is a team 
award. … I appreciate them, through all the adversity that we 
have gone through, for them to never let up and 
just keep fight-
ing.”
This regular 
season, Noah 
averaged 11.3 
rebounds per game — sixth 
most in the 
league — with 7.7 coming each 
game on the defensive end. The 
former UF standout averaged 1.5 blocks — 12th most in the NBA 
— and 1.2 steals per game to go along with 12.6 points per contest. 
He finished the season with 47 double-doubles in 80 games, tying 
for fourth most in the league. 
Noah and the Bulls, who 
dropped Game 1 to the Wizards 
102-93, will square off against Washington tonight at 9:30 in the 
United Center in Chicago. 
Parsons drops 24 in defeat:  
In the first half of his team’s 122-
120 home overtime loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday 
night, Houston Rockets forward Chandler Parsons went off.
The third-year starter had 17 
points on 7-of-10 shooting by the end of the half as the Rockets led 
49-48. 
Three of his seven early makes 
came from downtown. 
Parsons finished the game with 
24 points on 10-of-21 shooting, in-cluding a 3-of-11 clip from beyond 
the arc in 47 minutes of action.
The Rockets face the Blazers in 
Game 2 of the first-round playoffs 
series on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m.Former UF center named NBA Defensive Player of the Year

the bullpen role that has him third on the 
team in innings pitched with 38.1. Poyner (3-3, 3.99) is just one roster move that has 
reaped dividends in Florida’s (27-13, 12-6 
Southeastern Conference) climb to No. 6 in the latest Baseball America poll.
“I had no idea. Things change. Roles 
change,” Poyner said. “I’m enjoying reliev-ing. I’m having a great time. It’s helping us, so it’s been good.”
Right-hander Karsten Whitson (1-0, 
4.29), another pitcher who moved from the rotation to the bullpen, looks to extend Florida’s six-game winning streak Tuesday night against Jacksonville (13-25, 7-10 At-lantic Sun Conference) when he makes his first start since facing Florida Atlantic on April 1. 
Whitson hasn’t pitched as well as expect-
ed 40 games into his fourth season with UF, but the emergence of right-hander Aaron Rhodes (4-2, 2.51) has given the Gators a 
long reliever and now-consistent Saturday 
starter. 
Freshman Friday-night starter Logan 
Shore (4-2, 1.83) and Rhodes make for an unlikely one-two punch at the top of Flor-
ida’s rotation. 
Shore entered the season as a talented 
signee from Coon Rapids, Minn., who 
hadn’t thrown a collegiate pitch. Rhodes 
began 2014 as an unknown to those outside 
the team after tossing just 18.1 innings a year ago.
The rotation stability coupled with a 
steady bullpen — led by Poyner — has coin-
cided with the return of center fielder Har-
rison Bader, who missed the first 18 games of the season due to a suspension stemming from a scooter accident before the season 
began.
O’Sullivan used five different combina-
tions to fill out his first four lineup spots 
before Bader returned to the lineup. He has tried two in the past 20 games, with Bad-
er manning the third spot day in and day 
out. Richie Martin and Casey Turgeon flip-flopped at the top of the order on March 20. 
Bader reached base in all five at-bats in the series finale against Georgia.
“Getting him back is huge. You can’t 
replace such a good player on and off the field. He’s always working hard,” freshman third baseman John Sternagel said of Bader. 
“He’s a good leader by example, too.”
Sternagel has taken hold of Florida’s 
starting spot at third base. He made his first 
start at third base on March 25 in the Flor-
ida-Florida State matchup in Jacksonville. 
He garnered 15 at-bats before the start. He’s tripled that in the month since. 
As Poyner said, roles change. Those 
roles have started figuring themselves out. 
A steady stream of winning has resulted, in-
cluding a 10-3 win on Sunday that showed there’s no letting up from the Gators no matter how well they’re playing. Florida 
took two games from Georgia on Saturday 
in a day-night doubleheader.
“We talked about it [Sunday] morn-
ing. You can’t be satisfied in this league with just two wins. Georgia is a very good 
team,” O’Sullivan said. “They weren’t go-
ing to give up. They weren’t going to quit. They were going to come out ready to go and they did.”TUESDAY, APRIL 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Week award on Monday.
For the season, the Lincoln, 
Calif., native has a .326 clip at the 
plate, nine home runs and a team-best 51 RBIs — the fourth-best 
mark in the SEC.
Stewart continued to showcase 
her offensive prowess that has 
been evident all season. Against TAMU, the sophomore second baseman went 9 for 11 at the plate while hitting a home run and two doubles in the series finale.
Stewart is tied with Texas 
A&M’s Emily Albus with an SEC-leading 69 hits. The Wichita, Kan., native also has top-10 conference marks in batting average (seventh, .416), doubles (tied for fourth, 12), triples (tied for first, four) and sto-len bases (fourth, 24).
But of Florida’s strong showings 
on offense, Medina’s was probably 
the most eye-popping. The short-
stop, a sub-.250 batter through her first two seasons, went 4 for 7 against the Aggies and hit a grand 
slam — the first of her career and 
the seventh of the season for the Gators — during UF’s 17-4 win on Saturday.
Following the series, Medina 
has career-best marks in batting average (.268), slugging percent-age (.357) and on-base percentage (.359).
Little becoming regular starter: 
After being used sparingly to start the season, outfielder Briana Little is seeing more time in the starting lineup as the regular season winds down.
The Middleburg native started 
Florida’s last five games — four in left field and one in right field — 
after starting only seven of UF’s 
first 43 contests.
Little, a veteran who started 
64 games in her first two seasons, has proven to be a valuable asset for the Gators as of late. In her 12 starts this season, which includes four contests against top-25 teams, Florida is undefeated.Since returning to the starting 
lineup on April 11, Little has a .471 batting average, six RBIs and five runs. She paces the Gators with a .517 on-base percentage while bat-ting .364 on the year.
Notes:  After sweeping Texas 
A&M, Walton now has 600 ca-reer wins as a head coach. After going 123-64 in his three years at 
Wichita State to start his career, 
Walton’s record in nine years at UF is 477-110. … Junior Lauren Haeger hit two home runs against Texas A&M this weekend. Prior to the series, the Peoria, Ariz., na-tive had not recorded a home run since UF’s 10-2 win against LSU on March 16. Haeger now has 12 
home runs on the season, tying 
her with Auburn’s Branndi Melero for the fourth-most in the SEC. … After its powerhouse performance this weekend, Florida now holds the top spot in the conference in on-base percentage with a .441 mark. UF also leads the SEC with 245 walks.
Soft , from page 13Florida will lose three members of title squad to graduation
In her sophomore year, Spicer 
had consistently competed on 
beam while only competing on vault twice. As a freshman she competed in all but two meets on both vault and beam. She hadn’t competed on floor, before this year, since 2012.
Regular members of almost all 
event lineups, Mackenzie Caquat-to and Alaina Johnson have tast-ed their second and final NCAA Championship. 
“What a way to finish off their 
careers, winning back-to-back na-tional titles,” Faehn said. “Espe-cially with as many injuries that they’ve had to deal with through-out their careers.” Florida will return all but three 
members of its current roster for the 2015 season. 
“Of course it’s always taking a 
step back and reevaluating what we’ll lose and what we’ll gain,” Faehn said. “And restructuring lineups and coming up with all new routines. It’ll be exciting.” Faehn is now familiar with 
managing high expectations and pressure put on her team to repeat national titles. 
She has her plan ready now that 
she’s heading into her 13th season coaching at UF.
 “Start all over again,” Faehn 
said. “That’s the best part.”

� BURGESS IS SECOND IN SCORING.
  EDEN OTERO
 Alligator Writer @edenotero_l 
  “Just close your eyes and tell me where 
you are.”
  “I want to be a Florida Gator.”
  It was that simple. Two seconds and Sam-
mi Burgess knew.
  Sitting on the phone with her mother, 
stressed and nervous about where she was meant to be, Burgess made the biggest deci-sion of her life by just closing her eyes and tak-ing a few deep breaths.
  She saw it.  The school. The team. And the sunshine.  Everything Burgess wanted — needed — 
she found at Florida.
  If you asked her when she knew she would 
be going to Florida, she would tell you in that moment on the phone with her mother — not when she visited the school at only 16 years old, but when she closed her eyes and saw Donald R. Dizney Stadium as the only place she wanted to play.
  UF was not new to Burgess. She began go-
ing to Florida football games with her stepfa-ther, Scott Bentkowski, when she was 7 years old, which became a regular bonding experi-ence for the two.
  “My stepdad has always liked Florida,” 
Burgess said. “We started watching the foot-ball games when I was in fourth grade and I was like, ‘I want to go there.’ But they never 
had a team.”
  Burgess’ stepfather became Sammi’s men-
tor as she continued into club lacrosse. Bent-
kowski was a lacrosse player in college, play-ing for Salisbury — a university in Maryland.
  Their love for lacrosse ultimately bonded 
them, and Bentkowski began coaching Bur-gess when she became a player for the Mary-land Sky Walkers, a local club team.
  It was with the Sky Walkers that Burgess 
was discovered by McDonogh School wom-en’s lacrosse coach Chris Robinson. Robinson saw her play in her ﬁ  rst game in the attacker position. Before that, she had mostly played defense. At McDonogh, Burgess was part of 
a team that won 91 straight games while she 
was in high school.
    After two years of being offered spots on 
teams all across the country — including her 
hometown Terrapins — she narrowed down her options to Northwestern, Maryland and Florida.
  Northwestern fought hard for Burgess, 
who was a top recruit in the 2014 recruiting class and an Under Armour All-American First-Team selection.     But most importantly, coaches were drawn to Burgess because of her attitude on the ﬁ  eld.
  Her parents, high school coach and even 
UF coach Amanda O’Leary have described her as her own biggest critic. But her perfec-tionism is what helped make her the rough and tough player she is, Robinson said. 
  That tough mentality came out in her ﬁ  nal 
high school game.
  “Their senior year championship game, 
they were down in the second half,” said Bur-gess’ mother, Michelle Bentkowski. “They had won it every year, they won every game in high school. I was on the sidelines saying, ‘We’re not done here, we’re not done.’”
    Northwestern, one of Florida’s biggest 
rivals in the American Lacrosse Conference, saw the same talent Michelle Bentkowski saw. 
  The school knew Burgess’ impact as a 
leader, an offensive weapon and momentum builder was undeniable — she had proven it on the ﬁ  eld time and time again. The Forest Hill, Md., native could bring more than just points to a team, and that’s what made her a 
top recruit. 
  But Northwestern was not where Burgess 
saw herself.   Her decision to decline the Wild-
cats’ invitation to join the team came on her ﬂ  ight home after her second visit.
  As she sat on the cramped ﬂ  ight heading 
back to Maryland, she turned to her mother and said Northwestern was not where she wanted to go.
  “She looked at me and said, ‘I just can’t go 
to school at Northwestern,’ and I said, ‘OK. It’s your decision, it’s always been your de-cision,’” Michelle Bentkowski said.   “She just said, ‘It’s nothing against the coaches. It’s a great school, but I don’t think it’s the right ﬁ  t for me.’ When we went to visit Florida, we all were impressed. I looked at Scott as the non-athlete of the family and said I know why any athlete would want to come here.”
  For Burgess,   it all came down to what 
school provided the best education and ath-letics program. Florida’s weather was just a bonus for the freshman.
  “I wanted to play somewhere that was in 
the top ﬁ  ve, had a good education, but noth-ing really compares to Florida,” Burgess said. “It’s just the whole package. I don’t think any-thing compares to here.”
  When Burgess made her decision and said 
goodbye to the friends and teammates she had played with for four years, she started a new chapter in her life. One that her mother believes will result in a national champion-ship title for Florida’s lacrosse program.
  “Everyone thought this was going to be a 
rebuilding year,” Michelle Bentkowski said. 
“I’m going to tell you, it’s not rebuilding. 
They want to win. They want to bring a na-tional title to Florida.”
  Florida’s freshmen, Burgess and 10 other 
top-notch recruits have been referred to as Stage 2 in the lacrosse program, which lost its talented inaugural class after the 2013 season.
  But Scott Bentkowski believes otherwise.  “They aren’t rebuilding,” he said. “They’re 
just reloading.”
