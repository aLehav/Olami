VIRUS AND ALTERED FOOTBALL SEASON
Payton Titus
Alligator Staff Writer 
During the Fall in Gainesville, everything revolves around 
Saturdays.
Residents, fans and city officials have waited with bated 
breath on some sort of decision regarding football — a pillar 
of the city’s economy — amid a global health crisis.
In an era where the only certainty is uncertainty, one par -
ticular dilemma for college towns is how the changes made 
to the college football season will impact the local economy.
Thursday evening, the SEC announced a 10-game confer -ence-only schedule in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. This 
means no UF-FSU game for the first time in more than 60 
years and likely less than the typical six- or seven-home-game 
slate the Gators are used to.
In a normal year, Florida’s football program has a direct 
economic impact of $71 million on the city of Gainesville, ac -
cording to a 2017-2018 UF IFAS report. Approximately 520,000 
people —  more than 74,000 people per game — come to the 
stadium to watch Gators football every Fall. Between in-state 
and out-of-state visitors, not including UF students or staff, 
game day crowds generate 422,475 days of lodging. The av -
erage guest spends about $168 per day between recreation 
and entertainment, food and beverage and hotel expenses.
While Florida football has not been outright canceled, in -
dividual conference plans are subject to change should the NCAA Board of Governors make a sweeping decision at its 
Aug. 4 meeting. UF athletic director Scott Stricklin has said 
he is also unsure about stadium occupancy restrictions and 
therefore home-game ticket sales as well.
“Once we have an idea of what our attendance capacity 
could be, we will release our ticketing and seating plan and 
communicate that to our 2020 season ticket holders, ” Stricklin 
said in a virtual press conference immediately following the 
SEC’s announcement.
Last year, football ticket sales revenue amounted to just 
over $26 million, according to the Gainesville Sun. Because of 
social distancing guidelines, fans may not be permitted to at -
tend games this Fall. If they are allowed, the SEC could advise

DEPARTMENTS ATTEMPT TO 
INCREASE DIVERSITY, INCLUSION 
Lianna Hubbard
Alligator Staff Writer
Racial equality has long been a source of con -
tention at UF. Amid national Black Lives Matter 
protests, faculty say they’re trying to make a dif -
ference.
Over the past two months, many depart -
ments held town halls to hear about experiences 
and grievances at UF. Some administrators said 
they’ve invested in increasing diversity and com -
bating racism for years, but protests following 
George Floyd’s death prompted them to reevalu -
ate. Others said focusing on COVID-19 has pre -
vented them from addressing the issue.
The Alligator reached out to 91 departments 
and 16 colleges to find out how each is combat -
ing systemic racism. Five department chairs and 
two deans responded. Here’s what we learned.
How will departments increase diversity 
among faculty and students?
Hispanic and Asian students’ enrollment at UF 
has risen since 2015, according to UF enrollment 
data. During the same time, the Black student 
population decreased.
Many departments are trying to figure out 
why.
Animal sciences chair John Arthington said his 
department will establish a diversity and inclu -
sion committee by August. Its objectives are still 
being decided.
“Agriculture in general has not been attractive 
to the Africian American community as a profes -
sion, ” Arthington said. “Is that because we haven’t 
done a good job attracting that group to our pro -
fession? Maybe that’s what it is. We need to reach 
out and figure out why. ”
The entomology and nematology depart -
ment formed a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Committee in May, according to department 
chair Blair Siegfried. It had planned to create the 
committee since Fall, Siegfried said, but Black 
Lives Matter protests spurred the department to 
act now.
The committee, made up of seven faculty, a staff member, two graduate students and a post -
doctoral student, released a climate survey to 
department employees and students in July. The 
results have not been collected. 
The department is trying to correct decades 
of exclusion in the discipline, Siegfried said, but 
change won’t happen overnight. 
The Spanish and Portugese department faces 
similar trouble with recruiting diverse students. 
However, it is too overwhelmed with COVID-19 
safety preparations to follow through with plans 
to promote student diversity in Fall, said Gillian 
Lord, the department chair.
“That’s a conversation that just never got on 
the agenda because the world fell apart in Febru -
ary, ” she said.
The industrial and systems engineering chair, 
David Kaber, said hiring committees in his de -
partment prioritize diversity. Faculty involved in 
search committees reach out to candidates who 
are in underrepresented minority groups, he said.
“There’s substantial diversity and breadth in 
our recruiting activity, ” he said.
Data from UF’s workforce headcount indicates 
diverse recruiting alone doesn’t make for a di -
verse workplace. The industrial and systems engi -
neering department hasn’t recorded having Black 
faculty since 2010 at least, though Black people 
make up 7.9 percent of industrial engineers in the 
U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statis -
tics.
University-wide racial diversity among faculty 
is low, too. In Fall, 67 percent of UF’s faculty was 
white. There has been some progress since 2015, 
with Hispanic, Black and Asian faculty increasing.
All department chairs who spoke with The Al -
ligator expressed a similar idea: a diverse student 
body could lead to a diverse faculty.
Diverse UF students could go on to apply for 
positions at the university and increase diversity 
among its applicants, Siegfried said.
How will they address racism?
Town halls and listening sessions on racism 
popped up across the university amid Black Lives 
Matter protests. The industrial and systems engi -
neering department released a statement about 
needing racial justice after a student asked them 
to after their town hall.The statement does not include specific steps 
on how to increase diversity or combat racism. 
The College of Journalism and Communica -
tions plans to review diversity in its curriculum 
and reading material at the annual faculty retreat 
in August, said Dean Diane McFarlin. It is also 
making a process for employees and students to 
report microaggressions to administration anon -
ymously. 
Microaggressions include minute, everyday 
slights that people of marginalized groups face, 
according to the American Psychology Associa -
tion.
With its new Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Committee, the entomology and nematology 
department chair said they would like to bring an 
entomologist or nematologist seminar speaker 
once a semester who “represents diversity. ” 
“We don’t have all the answers, but we’re tak -
ing positive steps, ” Siegfried said.
Conversations about racial tension or inequity 
at UF did not begin with George Floyd’s murder. 
Multiple incidents over the years have prompted students to protest and petition for a more equi -
table campus.
Fifteen of the 16 colleges have associate deans 
and committees dedicated to diversity and inclu -
sion. Also, the university hired its first Chief Diver -
sity Officer, Antonio Farias, in 2018. Farias estab -
lished diversity liaisons, began a podcast about 
inclusion and created diversity grants, according 
to UF’s website.
UF President Kent Fuchs announced June 18 
plans to address racism and increase diversity, 
including employee and student bias training, 
banning the Gator Bait chant at sports events and 
calling for university leadership to increase diver -
sity efforts.
“It takes effort. It takes time, but I hope you’ll 
see changes in ten years from now, ” Siegfried said.

SpaceX capsule and NASA crew 
make first splashdown in 45 
years
Two NASA astronauts returned 
to Earth on Sunday in a dramatic, 
retro-style splashdown of their 
capsule parachuting into the 
Gulf of Mexico to close out an 
unprecedented test flight by Elon 
Musk’s SpaceX company. It was the 
first splashdown by U.S. astronauts 
in 45 years, as the first commercially 
built and operated spacecraft to 
carry people to and from orbit. The 
return clears the way for another 
SpaceX crew launch as early as 
next month and possible tourist 
flights next year. Test pilots Doug 
Hurley and Robert Behnken rode 
the SpaceX Dragon capsule back to 
Earth less than a day after departing 
the International Space Station and 
two months after blasting off from 
Florida. The capsule parachuted 
into the calm Gulf waters about 
40 miles off the coast of Pensacola, 
hundreds of miles from Tropical 
Storm Isaias pounding Florida’s 
Atlantic coast. More than an hour 
after splashdown, the astronauts 
emerged from their capsule on 
the deck of a recovery ship, both 
signaling a thumbs-up as they 
headed for medical exams.
Portland police declare unlawful 
assembly during protest
The Portland Police Bureau 
declared an unlawful assembly 
Saturday night when people 
gathered outside a police precinct in Oregon’s largest city and threw 
bottles toward officers, police said. 
Until that point, federal, state and 
local law enforcement had been 
seemingly absent from the protests 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The 
demonstrations — that for weeks 
ended with tear gas, fireworks 
shot towards buildings, federal 
agents on the street and injuries 
to protesters and officers — have 
recently ended with chanting 
and conversations. Activists and 
Oregon officials urged people at 
Saturday night’s protest in Portland 
to re-center the focus on Black Lives 
Matter, three days after the Trump 
administration agreed to reduce 
the presence of federal agents. 
Groups gathered Saturday evening 
in various areas around downtown 
Portland to listen to speakers and 
prepare to march to the Justice 
Center and Mark O. Hatfield 
Courthouse.
Microsoft in advanced talks to buy 
TikT ok’s US business
Microsoft is in advanced talks to buy 
the U.S. operations of TikTok, the 
popular Chinese-owned video app 
that has been a source of national 
security and censorship concerns, 
according to a person familiar with 
the discussions who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity because of 
the sensitivity to the negotiations. 
The potential deal would be a 
victory for both companies, making 
Microsoft Corp. a major player in the 
social media arena and providing 
relief to TikTok and its parent 
company, ByteDance Ltd., a target 
of President Donald Trump. Trump said Friday that he would take 
action as soon as Saturday to ban 
TikTok in the United States. Trump’s 
comments on Friday aboard Air 
Force One came after published 
reports that the administration 
is planning to order China’s 
ByteDance to sell TikTok. Reports 
by Bloomberg News and the Wall 
Street Journal citing anonymous 
sources said the administration 
could soon announce a decision 
ordering ByteDance to divest its 
ownership in TikTok.
Florida teen arrested as 
mastermind of Twitter hack
A Florida teen was identified 
Friday as the mastermind of a 
scheme earlier this month that 
commandeered Twitter accounts 
of prominent politicians, celebrities 
and technology moguls and 
scammed people around the 
globe out of more than $100,000 
in bitcoins. Two other men were 
also charged in the case. Graham 
Ivan Clark, 17, was arrested Friday 
in Tampa, where the Hillsborough 
State Attorney’s Office will 
prosecute him as an adult. He faces 
30 felony charges, according to a 
news release. Two men accused 
of benefiting from the hack — 
Mason Sheppard, 19, of Bognor 
Regis, U.K., and Nima Fazeli, 22, 
of Orlando — were charged 
separately in California federal 
court. In one of the most high-
profile security breaches in recent 
years, bogus tweets were sent out 
on July 15 from the accounts of 
Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Mike 
Bloomberg and a number of tech 
billionaires including Amazon CEO 
Jeff Bezos, Microsoft co-founder 
Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 
Celebrities Kanye West and his 
wife, Kim Kardashian West, were 
also hacked. The tweets offered 
to send $2,000 for every $1,000 
sent to an anonymous Bitcoin 
address. The hack alarmed security 
experts because of the grave 
potential of such an intrusion for 
creating geopolitical mayhem with 
disinformation.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 88

4   ALLIGATOR    MONDAY, AUGUST 3, 2020BY GAINING CONTROL OVER THEIR 
EXPERIENCES AND PUSHING FOR 
CHANGE, SOME SURVIVORS 
FIND A WAY TO HEAL
Natalia Galicza
Alligator Staff Writer
“If you’re reading this, I hope you know 
how much pain you continue to cause me, ”  
an anonymous survivor’s story reads. “My life 
will never be normal again because of you. ”
Written on their iPhone’s notes app, this 
story is one of many others like it: survivors 
recounting and reclaiming their experiences 
— some anonymous, some not — to inspire, 
inform and heal.
The Twitter page @SurvivorsUf offers an 
outlet for survivors of sexual violence. The 
goal was to give survivors a platform to share 
their stories without fear of being judged, 
hurt or socially blacklisted, according to its 
owners. It received more than 50 submitted 
stories in two months. 
“We just thought that there were a lot of 
UF stories that needed to be heard, ” said one 
of the account’s owners. 
The owners carry an affiliation with the 
university and wished to remain anonymous. 
Their stories of sexual violence at UF led 
them to create the account. 
Especially prevalent on college campus -
es, one in five women and one in 71 men 
report experiencing a form of sexual assault, 
the National Intimate Partner and Sexual 
Violence Survey reports. According to the 
Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, only 
20 percent of female students report their 
assault to law enforcement — most fearing 
retaliation.
Meghan Ballis is one of these survivors. 
The 24-year-old speech language patholo -
gist spent her freshman year at UF — where 
she had wanted to attend her whole life. Her 
first year at the university was her last before 
transferring to USF following her assault. 
In an interview with The Alligator, Ballis 
recalled the incident that began with a Phi 
Delta Theta party in October of 2013. She 
said she remembers a fraternity brother tak -
ing her to a house away from the party. After 
a night of drinking, Ballis remembers fleeing 
to the bathroom, feeling sick and fearing for her safety. She hid from the fraternity mem -
ber. 
“I remember sitting on the floor trying to 
keep the door closed or locking it or some -
thing, ” Ballis said. “I knew I was really sick at 
that point and it wasn’t cool anymore. ”
After being moved to the attacker’s bed -
room, Ballis said her memory fades in and 
out. She remembers catching glimpses of 
her assault throughout the night. 
In response to trauma, survivors often 
subconsciously repress memories as part 
of the brain’s defense mechanism. The Na -
tional Violence Against Women Prevention 
Research Center found that almost one-third 
of rape victims develop post-traumatic stress 
disorder following their attack.
“I threw up in the bed constantly too, so it 
wasn’t like there was a question of whether I 
was okay or not, ” Ballis said. “And I vividly re -
member saying ‘no’ and trying to physically 
move his hands away. ”
She awoke the next morning not knowing 
where she was. 
She quietly climbed out of her assailant’s 
bed so as not to wake him. She remembers 
the floor being sticky, and looking in the mir -
ror to find painful hickies covering her chest 
and vomit in her hair: everything just felt so 
gross, she said. 
“I just wanted to go home. ”
Ballis didn’t report the assault to the 
police. She walked back to her fourth-floor 
dorm at Rawlings Hall, where she sat on the 
communal shower floor in pain.
UF conducted a campus-wide sexual as -
sault and misconduct survey in 2019. The 
survey found that 30.1 percent of under -
graduate women and 7.7 percent of under -graduate men at UF experienced “noncon -
sensual sexual contact. ”  
This is nearly a 10 percent increase for 
undergraduate women from the last survey 
done in 2015.
Caroline Pope, a 22-year-old UF sociology 
senior, is another survivor. Like Ballis, she 
shared her story on @SurvivorsUf in hopes of 
inspiring long-term change. 
Pope’s attack took place in 2017 at Zeta 
Beta Tau’s off-campus house, a fraternity 
whose members she said she considered 
“close family” at the time. Her attackers were 
people who knew her, she said. They assault -
ed her while she was drunk.
This is reality for a majority of rape sur -
vivors. The U.S. Department of Justice re -
ported that 78 percent of sexual assaults are 
committed by non-strangers.
After publicly identifying herself as the 
girl in a story posted anonymously on @Sur -
vivorsUf, Pope was put in contact with ZBT’s 
current president, Ethan Curtis. Upon hear -
ing her story, Curtis told Pope that the frater -
nity was in contact with the Interfraternity 
Council’s (IFC) national headquarters regard -
ing the incident. 
“As for the conversation we had, my God, 
it was incredible, ” Pope said. “I wasn’t sure if 
they were going to hold to the promise of be -
ing here for me and supporting me through -
out all this. I was afraid it was going to get 
swept under the rug again. That’s why so 
many survivors are afraid to come forward. ”
Curtis told The Alligator that ZBT held an 
interactive webinar on July 16 with Brandace 
Stone, health promotion specialist for frater -
nities and sororities at GatorWell, that dis -
cussed how to avoid being a bystander. According to Curtis, ZBT plans to enroll 
each of its members in the Green Dot train -
ing program, an international and university-
wide effort to train bystanders on how and 
when to intervene in situations like stalking 
or domestic violence, once the university of -
fers clearance.
“For me, it’s part of my healing process to 
create systemic change, because I don’t want 
this to happen to any other girls, ” Pope said. 
“It can happen in any Greek organization, 
and it can happen anywhere on campus. ”
After sharing her story on Twitter, Pope 
said she continues to be met with over -
whelming support on social media. Although 
she says being a survivor means a lifetime of 
healing, Pope feels stronger every day. That 
strength, she said, comes from using her ex -
perience to help others.
“It’s heartbreaking to know you’re not 
alone, but it kind of makes you feel a little 
better, ” Pope said. “It makes you feel like 
you’re not crazy. ”
The UF survivors page is currently work -
ing on a list of demands they will submit 
to UF’s administration to improve campus 
culture. The owners of the account also said 
they hope to partner with Green Dot.
“We want to recognize the fact that rape 
and sexual assault are rampant acts of pow -
er-based violence on campus, ” one of the 
owners said. “Our goal is for UF to acknowl -
edge this and take accountability. ”

HOW COVID-19 HAS IMPACTED 
THE LOCAL SKATEBOARD 
INDUSTRY
By Michelle Holder
Avenue Staff Writer
For a skateboarder, anything concrete is 
skateable. 
However, with the current pandemic, 
skateparks and skate shops worldwide were forced to temporarily close down. While ramps 
and quarter pipes were closed, skateparks lay 
abandoned for a few months.
With people staying at home, kids and 
adults alike had more time to pick up hobbies. 
Skateboarding for many became an activity 
that helped pass the time by. 
Raina Hartner, a 38-year-old store manager 
at FreeRide Surf and Skate Shop, said she saw 
an increase in sales at the beginning of the 
pandemic, before non-essential businesses 
were forced to close March 23, and FreeRide 
Surf and Skate Shop had to close for the time 
being.
While demand for skateboards increased, 
supply dwindled. The skateboarding industry 
experienced a huge dip worldwide as factories 
shut down. With a shortage of supplies, 
distributors could not supply online and brick-
and-mortar shops, which were starting to run 
out of materials, Hartner said. It’s become a 
competition to order skate supplies.
“Sometimes we’re able to get it and 
sometimes we’re not or we have to wait 
until we get put on a waiting list from the 
distributor, ” she said. “Then we try to put it in 
a cart, make a mad dash to the checkout and 
get it in the mail before it’s gone. It’s been 
pretty complicated. ”
Local skate shops also serve as areas of 
congregation, where skaters in the area can 
meet up and share a passion for skating. 
Gainesville has a rich skateboarding 
culture and history. Pro-skateboarders such 
as Rodney Mullen and Billy Rohan skated 
the streets of Gainesville. In fact, Rodney 
Mullen was sponsored by Inland Surf Shop, 
which was the original name of the FreeRide 
Surf and Skate Shop. Billy Rohan, another 
Gainesville native, now owns a private skate 
area and shop called Samurai, and helps with the local Possum Creek Annual Skate Jam. 
Tony Farah, the 31-year-old store manager 
at FreeRide, said he has had the opportunity 
to skate around the world, from Australia to 
Canada. He’s been skating for almost 17 years 
now, and has been part of Gainesville’s tight-
knit skate community since he started. 
“I just think throughout the years and 
years, it’s just kind of grown a really accepting, 
just awesome community, ” he saidFarah encourages everyone to go out and 
get a board.

schools to limit attendance to 20 percent capacity like some 
NFL teams are planning to do this season. That would poten -
tially result in Florida football generating just over $5 million 
in revenue from ticket sales this year.
Florida home games have been canceled or moved before 
due to bad weather. But this season’s schedule shake-up is 
different than when UF-LSU was moved from the Swamp to 
Death Valley in 2016 because of Hurricane Matthew.
Smaller — or potentially no — football crowds in tandem 
with the effects of COVID-19 will have a significant, unprec -
edented economic impact on the Gainesville economy.
Amanda Phalin, Ph.D., a lecturer in UF’s Warrington College 
of Business, explained how the pandemic will exacerbate the 
effects of limited football on the local economy. 
“College football programs don’t have long-term positive 
economic impacts on local economies, ” Phalin said. 
This is because of the substitution effect, she said
“That means that there are different ways that consumers 
can spend their money, ” Phalin said.
While over $70 million is being spent in and around Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium on game days, that money would be 
spent going out to a restaurant or a movie had there not been 
a matchup on the gridiron that day. 
Conversely, game days tend to depress economic activity 
around other areas of town due to the congestion brought 
about by traffic surrounding the game. 
“You don’t go shopping at the mall on a game day, and we 
don’t go out to get stuff done, ” Phalin said. “So, the overall ef -
fect on economic growth is kind of negligible. ”
But in a “COVID world, ” as Phalin described it, things are a 
little bit different. 
These alternate outlets for consumer spending that she 
referred to are few and far between. Businesses are closing 
or operating with limited hours. Consumer confidence, which 
makes up approximately 70 percent of the country’s GDP , ac -
cording to Phalin, is decreasing by the day. 
“We just don’t know what’s going to happen with the pan -
demic or with potential future lockdowns — the rest of the 
economy, ” Phalin said.
In response to economic concerns, Gainesville and Alach -
ua County are working to maintain the business that they’ve 
managed to keep during the pandemic and bring attention 
to lesser-known, CDC-guideline-friendly spending outlets for 
potential consumers. 
“Some of our hotels right now are busy with summer traf -
fic from the springs, ” Elizabeth Reyes, the sales and marketing 
manager for Visit Gainesville, said. “They’re staying booked on 
the weekends because of that. ”
Once autumn rolls around, Reyes said that people will still 
venture into Gainesville whether there is football or not.
Aside from sports, Reyes cited UF Health services, the 
springs and family visits as the various reasons people still 
come to Alachua County despite the pandemic.
All of these pulls working together have enabled hotel ca -
pacities in Gainesville to hover around 50 percent, according 
to Reyes. She explained that while this is still a hit to the hotel 
industry, it’s a more encouraging number than those coming 
out of surrounding counties.
However, Megan Yaeger, the general manager of the Holi -
day Inn Express and Suites in Alachua, expressed more con -
cern regarding hotel capacity rates. She estimated that, at the 
county level, hotels experience about 90 percent capacity on 
the weekends with home games.Reports regarding average occupancy over the last four 
months show cause for concern come August and Septem -
ber. In April, hotel occupancy for Alachua County was at 25 
percent, compared to 62 percent at that time last year. In May, 
hotels averaged 38.2 percent occupancy, down from 61.6 
percent last year. Yaeger said that she expects an even more 
significant dip this Fall because of uncertainty with limited 
football attendance, among other factors. 
According to Staci Bertrand, the vice president of econom -
ic development at the Greater Gainesville Chamber of Com -
merce, approximately 50,000 people drive into Gainesville 
every day under normal circumstances to go to work. During 
the pandemic, the number is closer to 30,000 now that some 
work from home. 
About 11,000 people report daily to work at UF Health, 
and based on COVID-19 test statistics, about 20,000 of UF’s 
faculty and staff are driving onto campus every day. These 
30,000 people consequently spend money in the area on 
things like food and beverages. 
Bertrand also expects people to come into the area for rec -
reational purposes. 
“You’re having areas like Butler North and Celebration 
Pointe where you don’t only just go to eat, but you go to 
spend the afternoon, ” Bertrand said. “It’s all open-air facilities, 
so you can go in to eat, you can go for a walk, and then you 
can go outside in their entertainment areas if you’d like to. ”
Bertrand stressed the importance of marketing these new 
areas and existing industry in Gainesville to foster economic 
engagement while the pandemic still lingers. She cited the 
EatGNV Facebook page the Chamber of Commerce created to 
keep people informed about and bring attention to local res -
taurants that are still operating during this time. Bertrand said 
the page gained about 1,000 members almost immediately. It 
had approximately 11,100 members as of Sunday night. In addition to intricate marketing strategies, Alachua 
County will aim to assist the community with local imple -
mentation of the CARES Act. According to Mark Sexton, the 
communications and legislative affairs director for Alachua 
County, federal money is being pushed to the states, which in 
turn, are distributing that money to counties, which have the 
option of adopting their own local version of the CARES Act. 
Alachua County opted in and will be receiving $46.9 million 
to distribute.
“The County Commission made it very clear that its prior -
ity will be giving money to individuals and small and medium 
businesses, ” Sexton said. “There’s also some money that’s go -
ing to go to government entities to assist with some of the 
extraordinary expenses that they have faced for the last four 
months. ”
Sexton said that the county commission will meet Monday 
to iron out the program’s logistical details. As soon as Tues -
day, the commission will open the application process and 
launch a website with more information.
Overall, the message from economic experts and county 
and city officials is the same: this pandemic is a socially and 
economically unprecedented event.
One thing is certain, however: Flattening the virus’ curve is 
essential for a return to normal life — that goes for the 8,000 
unemployed people in Alachua County, according to Ber -
trand, and for UF athletics.
“We want the community to be as safe as possible, ” Ber -
trand said. “We’re going to have an economic impact, it will 
be greater if the coronavirus doesn’t go away. The sooner we 
can all be safe and stop the spread, the sooner our economy 
will rebound. ”
