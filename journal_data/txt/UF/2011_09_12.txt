 HEEEERRRREEE come the 
questions.
  Florida closed out its early-
season nonconference slate with a 
39-0 throttling of UAB on Saturday night at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, dominating all facets of the game against an overmatched underdog for the second time in as many weeks. Now the Gators (2-0) turn their attention to the Southeastern Conference, to Tennessee, to their ﬁ  rst real test of the season.
  The offense is running smooth-
ly. But what will happen when it faces a team that stacks the box and challenges quarterback John Brantley? The defense has domi-nated, allowing three total points in two games. But how will it react to faster receivers, stronger run-ning backs and bigger offensive linemen?
  Coach Will Muschamp bristled 
when asked another question Sat-urday night: “Do you feel good about what you wanted to get done the ﬁ  rst two weeks?”
  “We wanted to be 2-0,” he re-
sponded. “And that’s where we are.”
  To get there, No. 16 Florida 
jumped all over UAB from the opening kickoff, which Andre De-bose returned 50 yards into Blazers territory. The Gators scored on ﬁ  ve of six ﬁ  rst-half possessions. They gained 512 yards of total offense, 300 more than the Blazers (0-1). 
  They dominated up front, run-
ning the ball on 55 of 75 plays from scrimmage. They held on to the ball for 36 minutes. They limited Blazers quarterback Bryan Ellis to 141 yards. 
  Chris Rainey led Florida with 
119 yards on the ground and 43 more through the air. He scored once. So did Mike Gillislee. So did Trey Burton. So did Hunter Joyer. Quarterback John Brantley was ef-ﬁ  cient, completing 12 of 19 passes for 195 yards.  
  Still, questions remain. Rainey   UNDER CONSTRUCTION

  Florida beat UAB handily on Saturday in The Swamp, shutting out the Blazers 39-0, but questions linger 
as Southeastern Conference play gets underway. Tennesee and its ninth-ranked passing attack await.

LAW ENFORCEMENT
  MORGAN WATKINS
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Law enforcement officials tweaked their football 
gameday procedures this year, including a new punish-
ment for of-age students caught with open containers of alcohol. 
  These violations are common during football games, 
and in the past a person received a notice-to-appear cita-tion that required him or her to appear in court for the misdemeanor charge, Lt. William Gainey of UPD’s spe-cial services division said. 
  Now, people who are at least 21 years old will get a 
civil citation instead — a consequence that carries a $200 fine but not a mandatory court appearance. 
  Exceptions to this policy, which was changed by the 
State Attorney’s Office, may be made depending on the circumstances, such as if a violator is uncooperative or belligerent, he said. 
  More policy changes this year include employees and 
vendors with access to the stadium on gamedays receiv-ing background checks, Gainey said. 
  “In the past, we’ve always made sure that employees 
have the proper credential or wristband, but this season we’re taking it a step further,” he said. “It definitely adds an extra level of security for Gator fans and people work-ing in the stadium.”
  There is a key rule that hasn’t changed this year but 
is important for fans to remember at the end of every Gators game, according to Gainey:   If fans jump over the lower wall onto Florida Field during games, they will be arrested and taken to jail.
  Leaping onto the field is a misdemeanor offense for 
disturbing a school function.  Few occasions bring a larger police presence to the UF 
campus than a Gators football game. 
  On gameday, about 300 law enforcement officials 
from University Police, Gainesville Police and the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office make up the force keeping the event running safely and smoothly, Gainey said.
  Some of those officials ring the field during game time 
to keep fans off the field.
  There are officers checking fans to ensure they aren’t 
bringing prohibited items such as strollers, umbrellas and coolers into the stadium. 
  There are detectives dressed like the hordes of UF fans 
in Gator garb milling about campus watching for suspi-cious people or activities. 
  There are special units like the bomb-disposal and K9 
teams searching for potential explosives. 
  “When you have so many people there, just out in The 
Swamp and on University Avenue, it is assuring to know that there are police officers there kind of making sure that everything is going OK,” said Jennifer Cephus, a ju- Gameday rules strictly enforced, harsher punishments imposed

September 14, 1962 – UF traffic officials say 
parking on campus is not a problem. One offi-cial notes two lots behind Hume and Rawlings halls, which, he says, are filled to 25 percent of capacity on most days. For any parking incon-veniences, he points to students who prefer to park in already overflowing lots.
September 7, 1990 – 14,000 draft-eligible UF 
students learn they are not exempt from a draft should Congress decide to reinstate one. There would be no college deferment like there was during Vietnam. One student says he thinks the lack of college deferment “sucks.”

Students can commit to performing 
good deeds today at Turlington Plaza 
in honor of those who died on 9/11. 
From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., students 
can fill out forms documenting the choice of their good deed and attach them to pictures of those who died in the terrorist attacks 10 years ago.  
These will be attached to a mini wood-en replica of the Twin Towers and be called the “Twin Towers of good deeds and love.”
The pictures were taken from a 9/11 
memorial website.
“When you actually see a picture of a mother, firefighter, businessman, you relate to it on a whole different level,” said Rabbi Berl Goldman, executive director of the Lubavitch-Chabad Jew-ish Student  and Community Center at UF, which is sponsoring the event.  
Students can perform deeds ranging from calling their grandmothers to do-nating blood. A flier will be handed out at the event with a detailed list of good deeds people can perform.
“The replica is used as a memorial 
wall and to encourage others to partici-pate,” Goldman said.
The event has been held for the 
past few years, but Goldman expects a larger turnout this year because of the 10-year anniversary.
Last year, more than 900 people 
committed to performing good deeds.
“It is an event that is unique because 
every single person can participate re-gardless of race or religion,” Goldman said.
The event is free and open to the 
public.
There will be a moment of silence at 
12:45 p.m. to remember the victims of 9/11.
“We feel that this is turning dark-
ness into light,” Goldman said.Good deeds to honor Sept. 11 victims
� HIGH DEMAND LED TO THE MAJOR’S CREATION.
MAGEN WETMORE
Alligator Contributing Writer
You spoke. They listened.
As a result of increasing demand from the Student Body 
for the option to major in international studies, the new ma-jor is being added this semester.
James Robbins, executive director of the Center for Euro-
pean Studies, said students have already expressed enthusi-asm about the new major.
“Dozens of students have expressed interest, which is sur -
prising since we just launched the major,” he said. “But at the same time, it’s not surprising since student demand is what drove its creation in the first place.”Some of the interest in international studies comes from 
students who are studying international relations, Robbins said.
While there are many crossovers between the two fields, 
students will continue to be able to earn a certificate in in-ternational relations, which is a “well-established subfield of political science,” he said.
International studies majors, however, can take a much 
wider variety of courses that have international perspectives — from anthropology to women’s studies.
While much of the critical tracking for the major is still 
being finalized, students will be required to take a course on an international studies perspective and a senior research seminar. Students pursuing this major will also be required to study a foreign language for at least two years, he said.
Robbins said freshmen and sophomores could declare the 
major this year and still graduate on time.New international studies major at UF“We feel that this is turning 
darkness into light.”

Sipping on a glass of Guinness and look-
ing up at President Obama’s televised visage, 
Lauren Poe waited for his moment back in the spotlight.
A lot has changed for Poe since he lost his 
re-election for the Gainesville City Commis-sion District 2 seat last spring.
He came to terms with the defeat. He took 
a real vacation. He became a father.
“Man can be as big as he wants,” the presi-
dent’s televised voice boomed on a Mother’s Pub & Grill projector screen.
Poe stood before a group of commission-
ers, young Democrats and other supporters Thursday night and announced it wasn’t over yet. 
He’s running to be a commissioner again 
— this time for the At-Large 1 seat.
Since incumbent Jeanna Mastrodicasa 
can’t run again because of term limits, he has his sights set on the citywide seat with Mast-rodicasa’s blessing.
The only hints of red in the room were raf-
fle tickets handed out by the Alachua County Young Democrats and flowers on Commis-sioner Susan Bottcher’s jacket.
Poe wore a blue- and white-checkered 
shirt and a dark blue Alachua County Resi-dent cap.
Clutching a microphone, he began.When he was a young adult, he got a post-
card from the local young Democrat group.
“I was so thrilled that somebody thought I 
was young,” Poe said.
The crowd chuckled.He told his history, asked for volunteers 
and summed up his platform — innovation, inclusion and invitation — in about 10 min-utes. Maybe less.
He didn’t breathe between the end of one 
sentence and the beginning of his next.He said he wants to make sure anyone of 
any background can call the city home.
He spoke, without naming names, of can-
didates who want to keep the commission from moving into the future.
“We need leadership on the city commis-sion that knows this is what this is all about,” he said to the captive crowd.
Then he spoke of his experience.“You will see me work with the entire com-
mission,” Poe said in his speech. “You know that about me.”Because his campaign officially began 
Wednesday, he could use volunteers, he hint-ed at the eager crowd of young political en-thusiasts.
It won’t be easy to get back to City Hall, he 
admitted.
Last election, he went door to door to se-
cure 2,045 votes in the run-off. 
He’ll have to do that again, but he’ll have 
significantly more doors to knock on.
He’ll have to be away from his 5-week-old 
daughter, Elizabeth Catherine. It’ll be tiring to campaign while teaching at Santa Fe College, he said. 
And if he wins, he’ll have to work with 
Todd Chase, who beat out Poe earlier this year in a run-off to win the District 2 seat by 418 votes.
But Poe said he has an advantage: He’s 
done this before.
Square one feels like a rare opportunity. 
Now, he said, he can focus on problems that affect the whole city, rather than one district.
He wants to fix up dilapidated parts of 
town, like the 13th Street corridor. He wants to protect the gains Gainesville has made, like the Gainesville Community Redevelopment Agency.
“I think that this is a really good time to 
consolidate a lot of that energy ,” he said in an interview.
The city election will be in 2012. An exact 
date will be set by October.
Other candidates who have jumped into 
the At-Large 1 race are James Ingle, a strong supporter of working-class issues and an elec-trician; Donna Lutz, a UF alumna and real estate agent; and Darlene Pifalo, another real estate agent who has been a Gainesville resi-dent since 1985.
There will also be a race to elect a District 
1 commissioner. The incumbent, Scherwin Henry, is not running because of term limits.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2011

possibility of a biological terrorism attack.

People packed into the Pugh 
Hall lobby Sunday evening to 
learn how Florida would react in the event of a terrorist attack.
The lecture, “10 Years Later: 
Is Our Nation Prepared?” was sponsored by the Bob Graham Center for Public Service.
It was held on Sept. 11 this 
year, on the 10-year anniversary of 9/11, to discuss the threat of a biological terrorist attack in Florida. 
About 70 students from the 
Civic Scholars Program joined former U.S. Senator and Florida Gov. Bob Graham in the discus-sion.
The students spent last sum-
mer analyzing Florida counties’ preparedness in case of an emer -
gency. Those counties included Hillsborough, Lafayette and Monroe. 
The students came from vari-
ous fields of study, including psychology, business administra-tion and chemical engineering.
At the session, each student 
located the county he or she stud-ied on a projected map of Florida. In either pairs or alone, they pre-sented their findings in three- to five-minute speeches. 
UF student Ryan Garcia stud-
ied Lafayette County, which is the second-smallest county in the state with 8,700 residents. He said a terrorist attack in that county would be unlikely.
“It would have to be a really 
bad terrorist to attack Lafayette,” Garcia said.
But in the most densely popu-
lated county, Pinellas, commu-nication would be the biggest problem in the event of a terrorist attack, presenters said.
In addition to the discussion 
on Sunday, audience members re-ceived sheets of paper at the door requesting that they vote for the Bob Graham Center, which is a finalist for a National Day of Ser -
vice and Remembrance Award. The award is given to organiza-tions that create public service projects in honor of the victims of 9/11. 
The winner of the award will 
be announced Sept. 23.Students analyze risk of biological terrorist attacks in Florida

  She said it was comforting to know that 
police were patrolling the area, ensuring she 
and other young women were safe in a situ-ation where some people can be intoxicated and unruly. 
  With officials handling a wide variety 
of safety issues on campus, most of the im-
portant safety risks for football games are covered. 
  The UF season opener against Florida At-
lantic University was a busy one for police officers, Gainey said.
  During that game, there were numer-
ous ejections from the stadium and arrests.This may have been due to the game’s eve-ning start time, which gives tailgaters more time to party — a development that often translates into more more work for law en-forcement, he said. UPD , from page 1  CLARE LENNON

  Students who want to run for Stu-
dent Senate can still slate with the 
Students Party until Friday.
P  arties are allowed to choose 
up to 50 candidates each semester to represent them in Student Body elections, according to Supervisor of Elections Toni Megna.
  Although the Students Party 
slated all 37 of its applicants, party members may choose to interview and slate more candidates until Fri-day. Slating closed Tuesday.
  The Unite Party slated 50 candi-
dates, and   six students are running as independent candidates. Five of the independent candidates in-terviewed with the Unite Party but were not slated, Megna said. They were able to pick up papers to run independently at a mandatory meet-ing Wednesday.
  Neither party has released its 
platform yet. Unite Party spokes-woman Christina Bonarrigo said party members will take students’ ideas on a chalkboard at Turlington Plaza from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday.
  Students Party Communications 
Director Carly Wilson said students can email her at carly@ufstudents.org with platform suggestions or to ask about slating with the Students Party.  Students will be able to vote Sept. 
27 and 28 according to where they 
live, on- or off-campus. Graduate and full-time undergraduate stu-dents can vote electronically at any of the 10 on-campus voting loca-tions.
  Students who are unable to vote 
on campus may apply for an absen-tee ballot on which they must indi-cate why they won’t be able to vote in late September.
  Megna said students should have 
a legitimate reason to request an ab-sentee ballot.
  “We’ve tried to make it super 
easy for them to come in and vote anywhere on campus,” she said.
  Absentee ballots can be found at 
sg.uﬂ  .edu, and they must be turned in to the supervisor of elections ofﬁ  ce by mail, fax or by hand by Friday.      Students still have time to 
slate before SG elections

Security can be a bit 
extreme at games
They don’t call Florida the “Sunshine State” for nothing. It can get a bit hot. 
If you have been to any of the UF football games this 
semester or in the past, you know that it can get pretty warm in the stands. You also may notice security can be quite strict about what you can bring into the game. 
Alcohol, of course, is prohibited as well as any backpacks or 
large purses that could be used to conceal dangerous materials.
Depending on where you entered the stadium, you might 
have been forced to throw away that new, sleek, top-of-the-line-cooling-technology water bottle you just purchased. 
Water bottles could be used to bring in liquor or odorless, 
flammable liquids that could cause harm. The chances that peo-ple will bring the former greatly outweigh the latter.
But what about empty water bottles? For the most part, be prepared to part ways with those at 
football games as well. 
The question we ask is: Why? Again, Florida is known for its hot weather, and fortunately 
the last two games have been during the cooler evenings. 
But picture the following scenario:You are at an afternoon game. Prior to the game, you might 
have consumed a few adult beverages, which may have dehy-drated you a little bit. 
You come prepared with an empty water bottle thinking 
surely you will be allowed to fill it up at the water fountains once you get inside the stadium.
You get to the gate and a security officer throws away your 
empty, possibly expensive new water bottle. 
You think nothing of it and walk to find your seats. About half an hour passes, and you begin to feel light-head-
ed. You walk up the 30 or so rows of bleachers towards the rest-rooms. You have a sip of cold water from the water fountain, but you realize you need quite a bit more. 
You then go the concessions. It’s an SEC match-up and there’s 
a long line at each one. 
If you are lucky, you might just get that $4 bottle of water 
before you faint. 
Could not all of this be avoided if you were  allowed to keep 
your empty water bottle in the first place? 
In our post-9/11 world, security can and does occasionally 
go overboard. We understand the desire to keep people safe, but sometimes the opposite can result. 
The invasive TSA screenings at airports serves as a good 
analogy to this. Imagine the psychological damage experienced by the children who are having their groins groped by strangers in uniforms. 
Do the ends really justify the means in these scenarios? Still, the question must be posed again: In what possible sce-
nario would an empty water bottle become a hazard?Americans deserve a sensible tax code
In 1913, the U.S. adopted the 16th Amendment to the 
Constitution, which created the income tax as a perma-nent source of revenue for our government. The growth 
of the income tax both in importance and complexity has rewarded generations of graduates of UF’s Fischer School of Accounting. 
In this era of high unemployment, few policies would be 
more beneficial to job creation and growth than to drasti-cally simplify the tax code and force all of my smart friends who know tax loopholes to go start their own businesses. 
There has recently been a lot of talk about raising the 
top tax rate for the most privileged Americans to 39.5 per -
cent. Warren Buffet has complained about his low tax rate of around 17 percent, but increasing that tax rate would take a lot more money out of the pockets of doctors and lawyers than those of hedge fund managers. 
Buffet takes advantage of every tax loophole and credit 
imaginable, as he should. If you are rich, buy stock in a company and wait at least a year to sell it, you get taxed at 15 percent instead of 35 percent if you made the money doing actual work. 
If we listen to Buffet and increase only the top marginal 
rate, we are punishing small-business owners and other professionals who have high salaries but make little in in-vestment gains. 
If one looks at the corporate income tax, the picture is 
even more obscene. For tax year 2009, General Electric Co. paid $0 in income taxes. In 2010, Carnival Cruise Lines paid 1.1 percent in income tax. Both had billions in pretax income. 
These rates occur when the top marginal tax bracket for 
businesses is 35 percent, one of the highest in the world. These companies took advantage of legitimate business expenses, deductions and loopholes. The problem is that they can do this while a smaller business without a tax department loaded with hundreds of talented employees cannot. 
The tax code is the federal government’s effort to con-
trol individual and corporate activity. We are rewarded for having children, penalized for being single, credited for producing ethanol and punished for making money the old-fash-ioned way instead of investing. 
If you are a student renter, 
you lose to the system because there is no special tax treatment for renting, while a plethora of exemptions exist for your land-lord. Our tax code is discrimina-tory because someone making 
$150,000 could pay 35 percent (actually more if he or she lives in high-tax California or New York) or 0 percent if he or she has a brilliant accountant.
 Smart people must devote a large percentage of their 
time to tax planning instead of focusing on activities that are truly productive.
An accounting friend joked to me that he needed taxes 
to stay complicated, otherwise what would he do? If you’re smart enough to get a good grade in financial accounting, I’m not worried about your ability to make a living. 
Plenty of jobs would still exist for accountants and law-
yers, as taxes are just a portion of what they do. Think of the power of formerly unproductive workers (in an economic sense) taking their brains to other areas of our economy. 
Though it has flaws, the economic plan put forward by 
Jon Huntsman, a Republican candidate for president, is a step in the right direction. 
He eliminates many credits and deductions and reduc-
es the tax brackets to 8 percent, 14 percent and 23 percent. The tax code retains some degree of progressiveness while drastically simplifying everything. 
If these tax rates would also apply to capital gains, or 
even if the capital gains rates remained unchanged, this policy would go a long way in allowing individuals to fig-ure out the most productive use of their labor, capital and time. 
Let’s make a tax system that a college-educated citizen 
can complete in 10 minutes, not 10 hours.

Quick, pop quiz! 
What do Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr. and Jesus 
Christ have in common? 
If you said non-violence, you’re absolutely right. 
For all intents and purposes, it’s a fact that if you ever men-
tion these men in an insightful or heated conversation, you are immediately looked upon favorably for the duration of your speech. 
Across the spectrum, I’ve found this to be almost univer -
sally true despite varying political or religious opinions. Why is it that everybody seems to idealize these great men of his-tory?
To see if this question has any relevance as it pertains to 
our personal sense of life, I’d like to take a closer look at the non-aggression principle in a more philosophical light.
It’s extremely self-explanatory and easily stated: Aggres-
sion is wrong. I would go so far as to bet that out of all the ideas floating around in the cosmos, more people agree on this single principle than any other. 
It could be that we take it for granted as so intuitively obvi-
ous that we fail to recognize its profound implications. After all, not many people give it a second thought that this princi-ple revolves around one fundamental concept: the use of force.
Force, defined in this context, re-
lates to any physical, fraudulent or any other limitation of freedom. 
In the 17th century there was an Enlightenment thinker 
named John Locke (you might have heard of him) who formu-lated this idea in his “Second Treatise on Civil Government” from those of self-ownership and original appropriation. 
Using it as a requirement for living in a civil society, Locke 
argued that the use of initiatory force ought to be outlawed entirely. The Founders then took his idea and slapped it in our Constitution, deriving from it all of our beloved rights and liberties.
It’s almost unbelievable how one concept can change the 
direction of history so dramatically. Ironically, in the midst of the American Revolution, the non-aggression principle argu-ably remained the single most important theme in leading to the foundation of the United States. 
Without narrating too much, my hope is that you’re begin-
ning to see that there’s much more to this principle than origi-nally meets the eye. Up until now,  chances are extremely high that you’ve yet to disagree with anything I’ve said.  
Regardless, with a fuller understanding of this principle, 
we’ll be able to form more integrated and rational opinions to otherwise controversial socioeconomic conflicts. I readily be-lieve that every political issue can now be looked at with fresh eyes after considering the notion of freedom. 
If you couldn’t tell by now, I have been operating with a 
hidden agenda. Yep, I’m a Libertarian. 
As such, I am urging you to blaze a path to truth in your 
own life by virtue of your own mind. Now that’s not so bad, is it? It’s all too appropriate to name this path liberty. This word “liberty,” often thrown around so aimlessly, has a distinct meaning involving the non-initiation of force that I’m asking you to recognize. Liberty is freedom from force. Without even consciously realizing it, you most likely already agree with and use freedom as a standard by which you distinguish right from wrong. 
We need to recognize and preserve our liberty if we wish 
to continue living freely; this task starts and ends only with the intellectual mind inside each of us.

man at UF.

Speaking Out
A few days ago, I read a news story about 
a man from the Middle East who shot his daughter dead in the hospital after 
she gave birth to twins because her husband passed away four years ago. 
Honor crimes are rampant in the Middle 
East. Unfortunately, these crimes have been linked to Islam, not culture, although it is purely a product of culture. 
Islam has never called for such crimes. There are no Quranic verses or Hadith 
“prophet’s saying” which enjoin the killing of the daughters who misguidedly committed Zina, or  “adultery.”
Strangely enough, the perpetrators kill their 
daughters and assign no punishment for their sons who commit the same act. It is a severe inequality Islam does not tolerate. 
The Quran considers females and males 
equal, and therefore puts them at the same level in terms of reward and/or punishment. 
For adultery, Islam ordains a 100-lash flog-
ging for the single female/male and an until-death stoning for the married male/female. Stoning was ruthless, I feel, but deterrent enough to protect the family from cheating. 
It pushes both couples to be as loyal as they 
can to their partners. It is the culture that picks out only the female to be killed as a price for the wasted honor.
As a Muslim, I feel sorry that one might 
think Islam calls for honor crimes when it calls for the opposite. With the advent of Islam, all types of oppression imposed on females have changed. 
Females used to be severely oppressed 
1,400 years ago, and current honor crimes are a remnant of that ancient oppression. Arabi-an women in the past were prone to rape at the end of battles. They , along with children, were captured by the triumphant tribes, who tended to use women as wives and children as slaves. At this stage of history , weak tribes felt very scared of the strong tribes and began to fear the results: If defeated, your daughter/mother/sister (your honor) will be raped.  To avoid such 
consequence, Arabs decided at that time to bury their young daughters alive. For 
them, it was the only way to clear the possible dishonor.
Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, came to 
people feeling sad if their wives gave birth to a female. He came to people who did not want to have daughters; they would rather sons. 
Sons defend the family, but daughters de-
fame it, in their eyes. Muhammad reconstruct-ed this ignorant mentality to accept female newborns and eradicated such nonsense. 
He taught them their decision of daughter 
burial is evil. The Quran says, “When news is brought to one of them, of (the birth of) a fe-male (child), his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief!  With shame does he hide himself from his people, because of the bad news he has had! Shall he retain it on (suffer -
ance and) contempt, or bury it in the dust? Ah! what an evil (choice) they decide on? (16:58/9)”
He also enlightened them that the birth of 
a female or a male cannot be decided on; it is a godly choice that should find acceptance. 
The Quran says, “To Allah belongs the do-
minion of the heavens and the earth. He cre-ates what He wills (and plans). He bestows (children) male or female according to His Will (and Plan). Or He bestows both males and females, and He leaves barren whom He will: for He is full of Knowledge and Power. (42:49-50).” 
Only through these verses could Muham-
mad create a new attitude toward women and convert this closed mindset into a more open one. As a prophet and a social reformer, he tried his best through Islamic teachings to defend the rights of women, but the culture remains ignorant of his teachings, continuing honor crimes to this day.

guistics department at UF.

Speaking OutTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
At churches, we prayed. At fire 
stations, we laid wreaths. At football 
stadiums, hands and baseball caps over hearts, we lifted our voices in song and familiar chants of “USA!” — our patriotism renewed once more as we allowed ourselves to go back in time, to the planes and the towers and the panic and the de-spair, to the memories that scar us still.
On Sunday , the 10th anniversary 
of the nation’s worst terror attack, Americans remembered — in our own ways, all across the land — a day that is simply impossible to for -get.
“Would it be nice not to see the 
planes fly into the buildings all the time? Yes. But we can honor all the people,” said 37-year-old Lea Pfeif-er, who marked the anniversary by participating in a “Freedom Walk” at Virginia’s Arlington National Cemetery along with her husband and 2-year-old son. “I think we car -
ry that horror with us every day.”
Far from the main ceremonies 
in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington — on small-town main streets and in courthouse squares, in big-city parks and on statehouse steps — thousands upon thousands gathered to unveil monuments, pledge allegiance and celebrate re-silience.
The anniversary was remem-
bered with public gatherings and private ceremonies, with gestures large and small. 
The nationwide memorials were 
as distinct as America itself: In Las Vegas, firefighters and police offi-cers ascended the 108-story Strato-sphere. In Nashville, Tenn., at a honky-tonk that bills itself as “Hill-billy Heaven,” a five-piece country band played gospel as a goateed preacher talked about Sept. 11 be-tween songs.
“We can’t avoid the suffering that 
life brings,” evangelical preacher Ron Blakley said. “But good things can happen on a bad day.”
On this day, there were motorcy-
cle rides in Alaska and California, a blood drive and dog walk in Texas, a Beach Boys concert in Colorado and many more events aptly named to capture the pervading themes surrounding the anniversary . 
In Grand Prairie, Texas, the First 
United Methodist Church saluted service members and first respond-ers with a “Spirit of America Musi-cal.” In Cooper City, Fla., the Ameri-can Legion planned a “Let Us Not Forget” poker run to raise money for care packages for soldiers over -seas.
In a small park next to the county 
courthouse in Bennington, Vt., se-nior citizens watched from lawn chairs as Boy Scouts presented wreaths and World War II veterans rang the bell of an aircraft carrier four times — one for each attack of Sept. 11, 2001. A monument contain-ing steel from the World Trade Cen-ter was exhibited as one victim’s father spoke to the hundreds gath-ered, calling for hope over whatever 
anguish might linger.
“It is easy to look at that piece of 
steel and despair,” said Don Goo-
drich, 68, whose son Peter perished when United Airlines Flight 175 hit the south tower of the World Trade Center. “But despair is what Osama bin Laden and those who follow him want for us. This we must not do.”
To 80-year-old Martha Ann 
Baird, there was no sweeter sound on this day than that of the ham-mers and saws used to build seven homes as part of a Habitat for Hu-manity event in Nashville. 
She said she couldn’t imagine 
sitting at home, watching the end-less loop of Sept. 11 sadness on television. As she cut a moisture barrier sheet so other volunteers could attach it to the side of a dove-grey home, she said focusing on the future — on building and moving ahead — was a more positive way to commemorate the day.
“We need to be erasing the bar -
riers instead of calling to mind the things that have been divisive,” she said.
In Joplin, Mo., a town itself dev-
astated by tragedy when 160 people were killed in the nation’s deadliest tornado in decades, hundreds of storm survivors and residents stood patiently in line waiting to sew a single stitch into an American flag recovered near ground zero.
The tattered banner was brought 
to Joplin by New York venture capitalist Jeff Parness, whose close friend was in the Windows of the World restaurant when the attacks occurred, and Charlie Vitchers, a former ground zero construction supervisor who recovered the flag and kept it in storage at his summer home until three years ago. They decided to take it to disaster sites around the nation as a symbol of hope and perseverance. On Sunday in Joplin, the final threads were be-ing put into place.
Across the country, thousands 
filled football stadiums on this the first Sunday of the NFL season. The sound of “Taps” echoed on big-screen monitors, played by a lone bugler in a Pennsylvania field near where Flight 93 went down. At the Baltimore Ravens game, as a huge flag was unfurled on the field, the chants began and quickly swelled: “U-S-A! U-S-A!”
Such scenes stood in stark con-
trast to those of a decade ago, when sporting events were postponed in the aftermath of the attacks, when life everywhere went on pause.
On Sunday , some just didn’t 
want to hit the pause button again. It was, in some ways, a stubborn show of how America survived the attacks, of how life really did go on. Said one American on an Internet message board dedicated to Army paratroopers:
“I’ll be spending the 9/11 an-
niversary celebrating. My cousin is getting married that Sunday at a B&B just outside NYC. I think that’s an appropriate proof that life goes on — the terrorists didn’t ‘win,’ and Americans are still living their lives in freedom.”8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2011

Some travelers were plainly 
jittery about flying Sunday . 
Others weren’t worried, con-fident that security would be tight on Sept. 11. And some fig-ured, well, whatever happens, happens.
In Los Angeles, Kim Pinney , 
who operates a daycare center in Virginia, booked the latest flight home possible from a friend’s wedding in the belief that that would minimize her chances of falling victim to a terrorist attack.
“If something was going to 
happen, it would happen dur -
ing the day and then it would be over,” she said. 
But authorities and travelers were clearly on edge:
Two fighter planes escorted 
a New York-bound American Airlines jet after three pas-sengers locked themselves in a bathroom during the flight from Los Angeles. A man was detained at the Kansas City , Mo., airport and a terminal shut down after authorities found suspicious items in his carry-on bag. 
But reminders of the day’s 
significance were palpable in airports across the U.S. as well.
At Boston’s Logan Airport, 
where the jetliners that brought down the World Trade Center took off, workers paused at 8:46 a.m. for a moment of silence to mark the time the first plane struck the twin towers.Airport security upped

TELLING YOU WATTS UP
Finally, real football is here. 
It’s Tennessee week, and 
while most everyone who 
gives a damn about the Gators 
couldn’t be more excited, Will Muschamp is worried. 
You could hear the doubt in his 
voice minutes after clinching a 39-0 laugher in The Swamp.
Despite winning in what most 
casual observers would consider impressive fashion, Muschamp saw something.The Gators scored 80 points 
against FAU and UAB, while only allowing three. For the second straight game, the defense held the opposing offense in check and imposed its will. Multiple Gators scored touchdowns and the de-fense forced a turnover. So what’s all the fuss about?
Muschamp knows what’s com-
ing to Gainesville this weekend: two absolute monsters, hungry and ready to eat the Florida sec-ondary for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
J u s t i n 
Hunter and D a ’ R i c k R o g e r s have com-
bined for more than 500 yards receiving and five touchdowns through Tennessee’s first two games. Led by sophomore gun-slinger Tyler Bray, the Volunteers tout the ninth-ranked passing of-fense in the nation. 
On the year, Bray has complet-
ed 51 of 65 passes for 698 yards and seven touchdowns — good for more than 10 yards per attempt. Rogers and Hunter both average more than 13 yards per reception and each already has a catch of more than 45 yards.
In the season opener, they be-
came the first pair of UT receivers to each rack up 100 yards in the same game. Then they did it again in Week 2. 
If you don’t get it by now, the 
point is this: UF’s underclassmen-laden secondary doesn’t stand a chance.
If you don’t believe me, you 
probably weren’t watching the same game. Either way, let’s go to the tape.

Less than 48 hours removed from a 
painful loss to an in-state rival, Florida 
found the perfect catharsis Sunday in a hapless Florida Gulf Coast squad.With five different scorers finding the 
back of the net and a season-high 30 play-ers seeing minutes, the No. 9 Gators (5-2) were able to empty the bench and unload on the Eagles (5-3) to finish their three-game home stand with a 5-0 win. 
“The big question in this game was how 
were we going to bounce back from such an emotional game like Friday (against No. 5 Florida State),” UF coach Becky Bur -
leigh said. 
“To come out with 
four goals in the first half and to dominate 
the way we did was a really good testa-ment to the leadership on our team.”After the Gators surrendered a goal less 
than four minutes into their 3-2 loss to the Seminoles, Burleigh pressured her starters to dictate the pace of the game and score on their early chances against the Eagles.
Forward Tessa Andujar would answer 
the coach’s call just 7:32 into the contest with a brilliant 10-yard strike from the middle of the box courtesy of an assist from fellow freshman Jillian Graff. Florida bounces back with rout of Florida Gulf Coast at home� UF RAN THE BALL 55

UAB’s defense knew the 
run was coming. The Blazers 
still couldn’t stop it.
Florida ran all over UAB 
in Saturday’s 39-0 win, com-piling 300 of its 512 yards of offense on the ground. The Gators got it done in every way imaginable.
After running back Jeff 
Demps left the game in the first quarter with a shoulder injury, Florida’s run game ventured away from its con-ventional identity, and the offense unveiled some new wrinkles. 
“We gameplan each week 
to win the game and do what it’s going to take to win the game,” coach Will Muschamp said. “We wanted to use some of those things this week. We thought it gave us a good ad-vantage to win the game.”
Muschamp and offensive 
coordinator Charlie Weis re-leased their version of the Wildcat and introduced a jumbo package with fullbacks Trey Burton and Hunter Joyer. Backup running back Mike Gillislee wowed the 87,473 fans in attendance with some sparks of his own and the Gators controlled the clock for more than 36 minutes to wear down UAB’s defense.

When Xavier Nixon came sprinting out of 
the tunnel waving an American flag, a powerful 
sense of pride was added to the normal pregame intensity. 
As he looked up into the stands, Nixon saw 
his mother, a member of the Army, and felt a few tears start to well up. 
Nixon and seven teammates with a connec-
tion to the armed forces were given the honor of carrying a flag onto the field Saturday as Florida readied to take on UAB. 
For Nixon, who grew up on Fort Bragg, 9/11 
represented a monumental change in his life. It led to both of his parents — his father also served in the Army — being deployed while he was still in elementary school. 
Although he was forced to grow up faster 
than he may have wanted to, Nixon never felt anything but gratification toward his parents. 
“It was a great sense of pride for me,” he said. 
“I saw my mom’s face and it almost brought tears to my eyes because I’m very proud of my parents for what they do.”
Nixon’s story is just one of many among the 
Florida team. 
For Charlie Weis, who was the impetus of 
the tribute, 9/11 was a day he lost a number of friends. He wore an FBI hat on the sidelines throughout the night. 
For walk-on sophomore fullback Jesse Schmitt, 
it was an opportunity to honor fellow members of the armed forces. Upon his graduation from UF, Schmitt will be commissioned as a second lieutenant. With Florida up 39-0 late in the fourth quarter, Schmitt took the first — and likely last — carry of his career up the middle for no gain.
And for Dominique Easley, Jeremy Brown, 
Lerentee McCray, Matt Elam, Loucheiz Purifoy and Jabari Gorman, the six others who carried flags on Saturday, the tribute held its own mean-ing. 
“I’m proud of all of those people,” coach Will 
Muschamp said. “9/11 affected us all in different ways and certainly was a very irrational occur -
rence that happened. It was very difficult to deal with, so we wanted to pay our respect to those people.”
The Gators also held special 9/11 tributes for 
local first responders before the game, honor -
ing a number of them on the field with a special playing of “God Bless America.” 
This led to the crowd bursting out in chants of 
“U-S-A, U-S-A.” 
Those same chants returned at halftime, when 
the UF band performed a modified version of its normal show, complete with silver stars and an oversized American flag.

backgrounds, was one of eight players to carry a flag on Saturday.

second quarter, Burton and Chris 
Rainey both took direct snaps in the backfield. Rainey’s number was the first one called.
The speedy running back, who 
finished with a career-high 162 yards of total offense, took two straight snaps in the Wildcat with just under eight minutes remaining in the first half. He went for 12 yards on the first play, then scampered 9 yards on the following play. Rainey finished with 119 rushing yards and a career-high 16 carries.
“It was fun, it was my first time 
doing it, so I liked it,” Rainey said of the formation. “I hope we keep do-ing it.”
On Florida’s next possession, 
Burton, who finished with six rushes for 46 yards, received snaps in the backfield. After faking a handoff to Rainey, Burton trotted into the end zone for a 5-yard score.
But the Gators’ unconventional 
running game against the Blazers went beyond the Wildcat.
Florida also lined up with Burton 
and Joyer, a true freshman, in the backfield together, marking the first time UF has used a jumbo package this season.
Joyer carried the ball three times 
on the night, including a 3-yard 
touchdown — Florida’s first of the game — on his first career touch. Joyer became the fourth Gator since 2008 to have the first carry of his ca-
reer go for a score, 
joining Burton, tight end Jordan Reed and former defensive lineman Javier Estopinan.
The Gators’ rushing attack didn’t 
stop there, either.
With Demps, the team’s leading 
rusher in Week 1, sidelined for most of the night, Gillislee saw plenty of time in the backfield. He carried the ball 11 times for 79 yards and a score, including a 19-yard run that featured two spin moves. The junior carried a group of UAB defenders for 4 yards before he was brought down.
In all, nine different Gators com-
bined for 55 carries while the offense passed the ball just 20 times.
“It’s nice to line up to run it when 
they know we’re going to run it, and we’re still able to run it and take possession of the ball,” Muschamp said.

“Breakfast with the Gators” to the start of 
the second quarter. 
Watch as UAB motions to empty. See 
how Bryan Ellis (who?) nails a 38-yard strike down the sideline for a touchdown? Marcus Roberson had decent coverage on the play, but it didn’t matter.OK, now, skip ahead to the Blazers’ next 
series. On 2nd-and-10 from the UAB 25, safety Matt Elam made the type of mistake you can expect to see when two freshmen and two sophomores start in the second-ary. He bit on a pump fake, hesitating just enough to allow Patrick Hearn to get behind the last line of defense. 
Had it been Bray instead of Ellis, that pass goes for six. 
Muschamp knows it. He said as much 
afterward.
“Defensively, I just didn’t feel like we 
were on top of where we needed to be at times. … We had some miscommunica-tions,” he said. “Those are the two I saw come out — I’m sure there will probably be some others on film as I watch it.”Sophomore corner Cody Riggs also ad-
mitted there was plenty to clean up before Saturday. But for as honest as he was, Riggs was also confident.
“It wasn’t no big mistakes, we can correct 
them and we’ll have them corrected by next week.”
You sure about that, Cody? Contact Matt Watts at mwatts@alligator.org.

Unknowns dominate discussion with conference play on horizon 
has touched the ball a team-high 
36 times this year, 19 more than the second most-used player. Can his 174-pound frame continue to sup-port the offense? 
Jeff Demps left Saturday’s game 
in the first quarter with what the always-guarded Muschamp called a “bang on the shoulder.” Will he be ready this weekend? 
Half of Brantley’s completions 
were in the flats. Can he really keep getting away with that?
And then there is the red zone. Florida drove with ease through-
out the first half, only stalling inside the UAB 20. Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis talked last week about the importance of capitalizing on red-zone possessions. Settling for field goals is a loss, he said. 
On three of Florida’s first four 
possessions, the Gators settled.   
“It’s demoralizing for an offense 
to kick field goals in the red zone,” Muschamp said. “You want to leave with points regardless; that’s the first thing. But when you get down there, you got to put seven on the scoreboard, especially where we’re headed.”
Defensively , Florida stifled UAB’s 
spread formation with a nickel pack-age. The Blazers relied on a short passing attack, but the Gators were able to disrupt passing lanes and lim-it big plays. UAB gained just 212 total yards, and last week FAU managed only 137. Still, questions.
The Gators couldn’t get a sack, 
and they only had two a week ago. Will the defensive line live up to the hype, or will they fade like last year? 
Florida now has one takeaway 
this season, a fumble forced by Matt Elam in the third quarter; Muschamp wants three each game. Will that ever happen?
Florida almost got burned twice. 
Once, a 38-yard UAB touchdown pass was called back because of an il-legal shift. Then, Ellis overthrew his receiver, who was wide open streak-ing down the middle of the field. 
The Gators feature four under -
classmen in their secondary — soph-omores Matt Elam and Cody Riggs, freshmen Marcus Roberson and De’Ante Saunders. Will they be ex-posed by a better passer?
“It’s going to get tougher, but 
we’re excited,” Riggs said. “We’re ready for it, and I think we’ll do a great job.”
They will need to because Ten-
nessee quarterback Tyler Bray will waltz on to Florida Field with plenty of momentum come Saturday. The sophomore threw for 405 yards and four touchdowns against Cincinnati last weekend. 
At his disposal will be deep threats 
like Justin Hunter and Da’Rick Rog-ers. And there will be plenty more talent. And, for once, that talent won’t just be coming off the home sideline.
“It’s no joke,” Burton said of this 
week’s opponent. 
“Every mistake you do, they’ll 
capitalize on it. They’re a little faster, a little bigger.”
How will Florida respond to a 
team that fights back?

Coach Jan Dowling expected the Gators 
to feel comfortable and relaxed heading into 
the first round of its season-opening tourna-ment. 
To say Florida held it together Sunday 
would be an understatement. 
Four of five players finished one under as 
the Gators sit in second place at the par-72, 6,205-yard Cougar Classic at Yeamans Hall Golf Club in Hanahan, S.C.
“There’s just a sense of familiarity,” Dowl-
ing said of competing at the same tourna-ment for the second straight year. “You get to know the course and some of its idiosyn-crasies a little bit better.” 
Florida finished the first round of play 
with a team score of 284 (-4), only four shots back. The Gators combined for 18 birdies, and senior Evan Jensen also made a pair of eagles on two par-5s.
LSU leads the 22-team field at 280 (-8), 
while North Carolina sits in third place five shots back. Alabama and North Carolina State are tied for fourth at 287 (-1). 
Dowling believes the leader board could 
shift drastically the next two days. “There are a lot of good teams here, but 
we have to take care of our own business,” she said. “That’s all we can control.”
Making her collegiate debut, freshman 
Camilla Hedberg started slowly but eventu-ally found her stroke. 
She recorded four early bogeys but re-
bounded with five birdies through her final 11 holes. 
“Camilla had a tremendous bounce back,” 
Dowling said. “Some of [her early mistakes] could be attributed to nerves, con-sidering it’s her first college tournament. She obviously handled it all very well.”
Junior Isabelle Lendl 
also tallied five birdies.
Dowling said she be-
lieves her team will play consistently the next two rounds due to its maturity and knowledge for execution. 
“We continue to make good decisions, 
which change the way you hit your tee shots,” she said. 
“The fairways and the greens are huge, so 
you really have to place your ball correctly off the tee and the green. We’re just going to go out and shoot the lowest score we can.”Gators in contention after Day 1

With a victory under his belt at the 
Western Carolina Invitational on Sept. 
2, freshman Jimmy Clark is making his presence felt in his first year at Florida.
He earned Southeastern Conference 
Freshman of the Week honors with the win, becoming the first Gator since 2003 to win his inaugural collegiate meet. Like any freshman phenom, compari-sons will be made to predict Clark’s po-tential success. But Florida coach Todd Morgan is just excited to have him.
“He was in a different class in high 
school,” Morgan said of Clark’s state championship and fourth-place finish at the Foot Locker National Meet.  
Morgan also called him “a one-man-
show.” However, Morgan said one of the reasons Clark committed to Florida was so he could be around other elite runners to help him become an even more talented long distance competi-tor. 
It became obvious he made the right 
choice this weekend, as the Gators men’s team won the USF Invitational despite Clark staying home as part of Morgan’s plan to rest some of Florida’s top runners.
Clark finished first among all run-
ners in UF’s first race but had four of his teammates on his footsteps, as only three seconds separated UF’s top five.
Morgan fully expects Clark to con-
tinue making an immediate impact on the team, helping UF compete further into the season. If so, the team’s chances of capturing the men’s SEC title for the first time since 1987 only grow. 
“We set goals as a team, and [win-
ning an SEC title] is on the top of the list,” Clark said. 
With Morgan’s 
guidance and train-ing, Clark said win-
ning the SEC is “a good goal.” 
Because of the difficulty of a colle-
giate training schedule, Clark said he strives to work hard and keep a posi-tive attitude throughout the season. 
“You go through pain in every run,” 
he said. “But there is that great feeling you get when you cross that finish line and you know that all that hard work that you put in before that race is pay-ing off.”Clark excelling in first year

Gators midfielder Annie Speese notched a game-best 
three assists against Florida Gulf Coast on Sunday.
Deep UF bench contributes in lopsided win
“I saw Jill going down the line, so I decided to drop 
back and she gave me a great ball,” Andujar said of her 
second career score. “I just saw the opening to shoot it and was really lucky that it went in.”
The early lead would spark a 13-1 shot onslaught for 
Florida with three more goals in the first 45 minutes, the first of which came from forward Erika Tymrak in the 16th minute. 
That was followed by another score from freshman Lau-
ren Silver eight minutes later. Midfielder Carolyn Triglia then finished a three-on-one opportunity just before the half.
The four-goal advantage would stand until the 58th 
minute, when midfielder Annie Speese found senior Lind-say Thompson on a through ball from 10 yards out, beat-ing a charging Florida Gulf Coast goalie.
By the 20th minute, the Gators’ deep bench of 21 play-
ers could be seen warming up on the sideline and filing into the game as part of 10 first-half substitutions.
As one of the early subs, Speese made an immediate 
impact with a game-best three assists and one shot tak-en.  Just 43 seconds after entering the fray, the freshman serviced Silver’s goal when she found the defender open along the left wing for an 18-yard score.
“We just wanted to come out and make a statement to-
day,” Speese said. “The big thing was just not coming out flat after a loss 
like that, so I think we took care of it.”
With no player on the field longer than 65 minutes, the 
Gators were also able to freshen the legs of the season-high six starters who played a full 90 minutes against FSU.
Senior defender Kat Williamson also had a noticeable 
spell on the bench after just 30 minutes of playing time. The NSCAA All-American selection from a year ago had not missed a single minute during Florida’s first six games.
“For them to have a little bit of a rest here in this game 
is perfect and some of the people who came in behind them did a really good job,” Burleigh said. “We just want to keep the level high from the first player on our team to the last player.” 
Florida split time between its goalies, with freshman 
Taylor Burke playing the opening 45 minutes in her third consecutive start. Senior Brooke Chancey began the sec-ond half in relief and was able to maintain the clean sheet for the Gators. 
Neither goalie notched a save in the match, as the Ea-
gles managed just three shots on goal.
