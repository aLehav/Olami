Just after the second anniversary of the 
Interstate 75 crashes that claimed 11 lives, 
the Florida Department of Transportation is gearing up to start a road-improvement proj-ect to better warn drivers of traffic conges-tion, heavy fog and smoke.
The project will install five dynamic mes-
sage signs, 21 vehicle detectors and 12 visibil-ity sensors as well as thermal and standard cameras in the two focus areas.
Paynes Prairie is “geographically chal-
lenged and predisposed to fog,” said Laurie 
Windham, a spokeswoman for the project. If there’s any fire, prescribed or not, the fog can 
mix with the smoke and travel to the adjacent highway.
“All these devices are interconnected and 
work together to alert motorists,” Windham said. State Rep. Keith Perry, who has been inte-
gral in moving the project forward, said it’s difficult to get real-time information to the highway.
“Unless you happen to have a police of-
ficer or highway patrol (officer) in the area, they have no way to know the situation has changed,” he said.
The large, permanent boards will be 
easier to update and will solve problems that

A Gainesville political orga-
nization held a protest and vigil 
Wednesday evening outside a local church to celebrate the an-niversary of the controversial Roe v. Wade court decision. 
The Gainesville chapter of the 
National Organization of Women held the vigil on the sidewalk out-side of the St. Augustine Church and Catholic Student Center, 1738 W. University Ave., to recognize the 1973 court decision that ruled women’s privacy freedoms ex-tended to abortion rights. 
The event consisted of about 15 
attendees with lit candles holding signs and talking about their per-sonal experiences with abortion.
Katy Burnett, the president 
of Gainesville NOW, said she wanted the event to make a state-ment to the church that shaming women who seek abortions is not acceptable.
Burnett said women die 
around the world every day try-ing to induce their own abortions because the procedure is illegal where they live.
“We won’t go back to that in 
the U.S., and we’re willing to 
fight for it,” she said.
Burnett said that the vigil is 
also in response to recent legisla-
tion that forced one-third of Texas abortion clinics to shut down.
The organization chose to hold 
the vigil in front of St. Augustine Church because members had seen Catholic churchgoers pro-testing in front of the Bread and Roses Women’s Health Center on numerous occasions, Burnett said. 
The Rev. Anthony Eseke, a 
priest at St. Augustine Church, said his church doesn’t sponsor 
the clinical protests, but it does 
encourage members of the con-
gregation to actively express their faith.
Eseke said that the church was 
open to the vigil and understands 
that everyone is entitled to his or 
her opinion. 
“We welcome the celebration 
of diversity, and this protest is 
a reminder that we can agree to 
disagree,” he said.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 84 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, JANUARY 23, 2014

About 15 Chinese students will arrive on campus this Fall as 
part of a UF College of Education initiative.
The partnership between Nanjing Xiaozhuang University 
and UF was announced at a ceremony held recently. The col-
lege approved a five-year agreement with the Chinese univer-
sity. The students from the university will participate in a year-long teacher preparation studies initiative.
UF College of Education Dean Glenn Good said the students 
will not be the only ones learning during their time at UF.
“It’s an opportunity for educators here to understand the 
needs of diverse learners in the international population,” he said.UF College of Education professor Danling Fu will be work-
ing as the students’ academic adviser. Fu, who is from China, 
first introduced the Chinese university to the college in 2011. Fu said the partnership displays UF on an international platform.
“There is a very strong teacher education component there,” 
she said. “This will make Gainesville more visible in China 
now.”  
The Gainesville Chinese community has already been re-
ceptive to the initiative, Good said.
“These individuals have real pride in Gainesville, and 
they’re excited to show it to their Chinese counterparts,” Good 
said.UF education college forms partnership with Chinese universitysee PROTes T, PA ge 4see R OAd, PA ge 4

The view of abortion as a 
sin is a fundamental Christian 
belief, Eseke said, and there shouldn’t be a compromise on human life.
Among those who shared 
personal experiences was 64-year-old Catherine Akins. 
The retired high school 
teacher recalled her near-death experience undergo-ing an illegal abortion in 1968 before Roe v. Wade made the procedure legal. 
“I hope that all these 
young people never have to go through that,” Akins said. “I hear all these gun advo-cates talking about the right to own a gun, but we don’t even have the right to own our body.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JANUARY 23, 2014

UF’s Swamp Party announced its 
candidates for Student Body president, 
vice president and treasurer Wednes-day.
Cory Yeffet is the party’s candidate 
for Student Body president with Vivan Nguyen as his vice president and Elliot Grasso as treasurer.
About 200 people gathered around 
a lectern flanked by two tables to hear the candidates speak briefly on their ex-pectations from the campaign and their goals if elected.
Yeffet, a 21-year-old UF political sci-
ence and economics senior, said he’s looking forward to a fun and positive campaign.
He is serving his third year in Stu-
dent Senate and is Senate president. Previously, he held positions as Senate president pro tempore, vice chair of the judiciary committee and the majority party leader. 
During his term as Senate president, 
Yeffet helped to design Heavener Hall 
and is involved in the overhaul of UF’s 
email system.
“I’d really like to make sure we ad-
dress the concerns of the Student Body,” he said.
Nguyen, a 22-year-old UF music and 
physics senior, said she’s enthusiastic about applying her prior leadership ex-perience to a larger student audience.
“I’m excited to listen to their ideas 
and be in a position to actually imple-ment them,” she said.  
Grasso, a 20-year-old UF finance 
and information systems junior, said he wants to create an open dialogue with student organizations to find out what they need to be successful.
“I’m looking forward to learning 
how students want Student Govern-ment to be improved,” he said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KISSIMMEE — Gov. Rick Scott on 
Wednesday pledged $130 million to Ever-
glades restoration in the upcoming budget.
Scott said during a meeting of the Florida 
Cabinet that the 2014 budget request would 
be used to help restore the Kissimmee River 
north of the Everglades. It also will assist in the reconstruction of a section of the Tamiami Trail.
Referring to the Everglades, Scott called it 
“a key to a vibrant economy, coast to coast.”
The budget request for the Everglades was 
a $60 million increase over last year.
“If you’re a fan of the Everglades, the gov-
ernor’s announcement today should blow your socks off,” said Herschel Vinyard, the governor-appointed Secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.
Scott’s announcement comes nine months 
after the Florida Legislature approved an $880 million plan for funding Everglades restora-tion projects. Scott negotiated the plan with 
the federal government.
Efforts to protect water quality for the Ev-
erglades have “turned a corner,” said Stan 
Meiburg, acting regional administrator for the federal Environmental Protection Agen-cy’s for the southeast region. But Meiburg said, “It’s going to take time, and it’s going to be expensive.”
Lawmakers in the upcoming legislative 
session have a host of other water issues to consider besides the Everglades. Scott on Tuesday announced he would ask for $55 mil-lion to restore and protect Florida’s springs. 
“Water funding is going to be a big, emerg-
ing issue,” said Janet Bowman, director of leg-islative policy for The Nature Conservancy in Tallahassee.Everglades to get $130 million

The Gator Nation is chomping 
into Instagram feeds around the 
world.
The #UFSocial team has 
launched an Instagram campaign 
featuring the hashtag #Gator-
NationIsEverywhere. Students’ photos from studying abroad are being featured on the official UF Instagram account, @UFlorida.
The #UFSocial team was in-
spired to utilize the tagline when it noticed the growing trend of fans referencing the Gator Nation throughout social media, said Bruce Floyd, a social media spe-cialist for University Relations.
“We were able to gather more 
consistent images, making the transition from more organic to more coordinated pictures and posts,” Floyd said. “We enjoy seeing images of Gators all over the nation and world, and we are excited to share them.”
This campaign also serves as 
an opportunity for the UF Inter-
national Center to promote its 
study abroad programs.
Jill Ranaivoson, a UF study 
abroad adviser, has been work-ing with the #UFSocial team throughout the campaign. She said she hopes the campaign will show students what it’s like to be a Gator abroad by highlighting 
various programs.
“It is hard to say if this cam-
paign will influence the numbers 
of people registering for our pro-grams,” Ranaivoson said, “But this has been great in helping to raise awareness about the servic-es we offer around campus.”
Abbey Konchan, a 21-year-
old UF marketing junior who traveled abroad to Israel with a group of fellow Gators, said she was proud to be featured in one of UF’s Instagram posts.
“The Gators are definitely a 
pretty international brand,” Kon-
chan said. “I wouldn’t even think 
twice about tagging my pictures with #GatorNationIsEverywhere because it is second nature for me to promote my school.”#UFSocial pinpoints

Early morning and late night are the most dangerous for fog
portable message boards tend to cause.
“They’re not accurate,” he said. “They 
become irrelevant. People tend to ignore 
them.”
Normally, the most dangerous times to 
drive are in the early morning and evening hours when the temperature is changing. The new technology should help students trav-eling to school and going home at night, he said.
The funding for the $2.1 million project is coming from the Department of Transporta-tion gas tax, “that you and I pay every time 
we fill up our car,” Perry said.
Gainesville Mayor Ed Braddy said he 
looks forward to the improvements, which 
will help residents travel safely and more ef-ficiently.
“I can only imagine how frightening it is 
to have a bunch of people out there driving and have some slow down, some that wisely pull over or take an exit and others who don’t 
seem to think it’s much of a problem,” he 
said. “When you have that dynamic, it cre-ates a risky, hazardous condition.” 
UF students look forward to the changes 
as well.
Francesco Lane, an 18-year-old UF psy-
chology freshman, drove through Paynes Prairie last weekend during heavy fog. He said the low visibility concerned him, espe-cially when he turned on his high beams.
 “You can see more of the fog because of 
the brights,” he said. “It’s almost like whit-eout.”
Lane said he believes more notifications 
of traffic congestion and weather conditions will help traffic problems.
“When there’s a bunch of stopped cars, 
just getting there sooner and notifying people that they need to slow down earlier” could increase safety, he said.

An idea sprouted by Chris Cano in 
Gainesville is now spreading its roots 
across the nation.
Cano, founder of Gainesville Compost, 
will be explaining his method of pedal-
powered community composting next 
week at the U.S. Composting Council Conference in Oakland, Calif.
With Cano’s compost method, local 
restaurants fill up trailers made by local business Kanner Karts with compostable items, which are then pulled by bikes to nearby compost centers.
“The model of moving waste out of 
town to be handled out of sight is not only infeasible in a lot of ways, but it’s uninspir-ing in a lot of ways,” said Cano, 26. “What we’re doing is inspiring. It’s showing peo-ple that there could be a better way.”
After presenting his mission at last 
year’s Recycle Florida Today for a Sustain-able Tomorrow conference in Orlando, Cano said it was so well-received that he was encouraged to submit an outline of his mission to the U.S. Composting Coun-cil, which then accepted him as a speaker for this year’s national conference. 
The support for the mission of pedal-
powered community composting was fur-
ther illustrated when Cano went to final-
ize Gainesville Compost’s registration and was told that an anonymous donor had already paid its $275 entrance fee.
Cano said he hopes recognition at the 
conference will help people develop ped-al-powered composting in other cities.
Alexandra Rozin, a UF soil and water 
science graduate student, said she hopes 
the national recognition of Gainesville 
Compost’s efforts will help the idea ex-pand to other places.
“I hope that just by people speaking 
at conferences, we can get more people to catch on to composting, but it will prob-ably take more than that,” said Rozin, 25. “Speaking is the first part of it.” 
Kanner Karts founder Steven Kanner, 
22, said he hopes Cano’s speech at the con-ference will provide incentive to advance sustainable technology internationally. 
“In my eyes, he’s a champion for pedal-
powered composting in Gainesville and soon the world,” Kanner said.THURSDAY, JANUARY 23, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A state ban on Internet cafes last year created confusion 
for local law enforcement about how to dismantle the busi-
nesses, but the City Commission is trying to remedy that.
In a meeting last week, Gainesville city commissioners 
unanimously approved a six-month ban on zoning permits for Internet cafes per the request of Gainesville Police.
Certain loopholes in the law permitted Gainesville to 
grant zoning permits to about six cafes, said GPD spokes-man Officer Ben Tobias, although none are currently op-erational.  
When the state legislature banned all Internet cafes last 
year, it tasked local law enforcement agencies with keeping tabs on remaining cafes.
“Even though there’s a statewide ban, no one really un-
derstands the law yet,” Tobias said. Tobias said the temporary ban on permits will provide 
GPD with the time it needs to ensure it is enforcing the law correctly, but it hopes the city will make the ban permanent after six months.
“The legislature and governor thought that this was 
a big enough problem to enact a new law immediately,” he said. “We all know gambling was at the center of these places. We hope that the city will make a permanent ban… not allowing any of these places to get (zoning) permits.”
City Commissioner Susan Bottcher said she also would 
like to see the ban become permanent due to difficulties in regulation.
“Unless you want to station a policeman at each of these sites to make sure they’re operating legally and make sure other nefarious conduct isn’t happening,” she said, “be-cause they tend to be highly problematic for law enforce-ment.”
Bottcher said that the city granted the six permits after 
the statewide ban only because some owners know how to describe their businesses in a way that circumvents the ban. 
“We walk a very fine line between wanting to be open 
to entrepreneurs who want to open a business here, but we also have to recognize and anticipate when there’s people who deliberately look for loopholes in the law,” she said.
Gainesville City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins 
agreed that Internet cafes have proved to be problematic 
for the city and those who frequent them.
“The problems we see with that are robbery, loitering 
and taking advantage of folks who are not in a good finan-
cial position,” he said.Internet cafe permit ban buys time for local law enforcementJADE CASTRO

College students are taking a tim-
eout from their Timelines.
A demographic report published 
by iStrategyLabs on Wednesday found 
the amount of college students on Fa-cebook has decreased 59.1 percent from 2011 to 2014. 
“I think it’s a natural progression,” 
said social media specialist Andrew Selepak, director of UF’s Master of Arts in Mass Communication pro-gram. “No social media outlet is going 
to be bulletproof.”
Selepak said he believes college 
students are leaving Facebook due to 
concerns over privacy and who can 
see certain posts. In this case, users are 
concerned about their parents seeing their posts.
“Parents and grandparents are getting on Facebook, which is leav-ing some students to figure that the cool factor of Facebook is gone,” said Selepak.
While the study showed that Fa-
cebook use by college students has decreased, it also showed an 80.4 per-cent increase in usage by adults ages 55 and older.  
“Parents have infiltrated Face-
book,” said Sinaya Harding, a 20-year-old UF animal science and anthropol-ogy junior. “You have to watch what 
you say and watch what you post.”
Even with a significant number of 
college students leaving Facebook, the 
study shows the website still retains millions of users, and the number of 
users overall continues to grow.
“Facebook is not going to disap-
pear,” said Selepak. “And maybe even 
the people who are not using it now 
will go back to it.”Users unliking FacebookLIFESTYLE

Five UF Theta Tau fraternity brothers have 
been selected to join a newly formed all-aca-
demic team for their scholastic and service-related achievements. 
The team was created by the Theta Tau 
Educational Foundation to honor local chap-ter members at a national level and to create a process for considering nominees for a new scholarship, said executive director Michael Abraham. 
Material science and engineering stu-
dent Tyler Martin, industrial and systems engineering students Michael Silberling and Katharine Johnson, mechanical engineering 
student Madeline Sullivan and chemical engi-
neering student Steven Geller were selected to represent UF based on their GPAs and active involvement in the fraternity.
“The all-academic team is a program de-
signed to recognize those who excel academi-cally in the very challenging engineering dis-cipline,” Abraham said.
With an average GPA of 3.6, the 90 stu-
dents selected nationwide for the all-academic team are expected to be an example to their chapters, he said. 
Students named to the team are separated 
into eight regions. One person from each re-gion will be chosen as team captain and will receive a $250 scholarship, Abraham said. 
Martin, who is also UF’s chapter president, 
said he received an application for the team in November and sent it along to his fellow members.
He said he believes that all of the honor-
ees from UF have an equal chance to win the scholarship.
“I know we have some really hard-working 
brothers,” Martin said. “I thought UF could receive some recognition through us.”Team of engineering students

Florida needs 
marriage equality
Whether you’re conservative or liberal, you have to 
agree the country is warming up to the idea of mar-
riage equality. In its latest poll, the Pew Research 
Center reported that 51 percent of Americans support mar-
riage equality, and with the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent de-cision to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act, pressure is 
being shifted back to states to legalize marriage equality. 
This week, six same-sex couples are putting pressure on 
the state to make changes to Florida’s constitution to allow it in the Sunshine State. We reported Wednesday that the 
couples ﬁ  led suits in the Miami-Dade Circuit Court against the state’s anti-same-sex marriage law. 
Many conservative critics in the state have voiced their dis-
dain for the couples’ actions. According to the Sun Sentinel, 
“Jannique Stewart, of Coconut Creek, is executive director of 
Love Protects, a Christian ministry that believes in a biblical approach to sexuality, and was South Florida spokeswoman 
for the 2008 amendment.”
“‘They can ﬁ  le the lawsuit all they want,’ she said. ‘In 
2008, we the people voted for marriage as one man and one 
woman. So they’re trying to thwart the will of the people.’”
Stewart’s statement and the arguments of other vocal anti-
marriage equality supporters in the state couldn’t be more off base. 
The political climate in the state has shifted in the past six 
years, reﬂ  ecting a growing support base for same-sex couples 
who want their marriages to be recognized on Florida soil — 
or sand. 
Gov. Rick Scott, who told the Orlando Sentinel last year 
that he believes in “traditional marriage,” has a slipping ap-
proval rating: only 46 percent, according to Politico. 
Marriage equality continues to be a hot-button issue, which 
is simply laughable. The argument is a no-brainer: Everyone, 
no matter his or her sexual orientation, deserves to marry in 
his or her home state. It’s unfair to ask longtime Florida resi-
dents to ﬂ  ock to other states in search of legal matrimony. 
Jeff Delmay, one of the men who ﬁ  led suit in Miami-Dade 
this week, told the Sentinel, “Our family is here. Our friends are here. Our life is here. This is where we want to get mar-ried … And we look forward to having the right and the free-dom to marry in the state which we love. And that day will 
come very soon.”
Six years ago, the majority of Florida was, indeed, against 
marriage equality: 62 percent of voters favored the addition 
of the ban on same-sex marriage to the state constitution. 
However, this number neither reﬂ  ects the current state of 
the country’s view on marriage equality, nor does it reﬂ  ect 
the state’s view. As the six couples and their litigation teams 
move forward in their lawsuit, the editorial board of the Alli-gator wishes them the best of luck and offers its full support.Death penalty is rife with inconsistencies
Dennis McGuire took 25 minutes to die on an ex-
ecution table in Ohio on Thursday. 
The state used a new, untested drug cocktail 
for his execution — midazolam, an anti-anxiety drug, and hydromorphone, a narcotic derived from mor-
phine. 
At ﬁ  rst, everything was going according to plan. 
He fell unconscious after the drugs ﬁ  lled his veins. A 
few minutes later, though, his supposedly humane death became a struggle. His stomach heaved. His ﬁ  sts clenched.
“He started making all these horrible, horrible noises, 
and at that point, that’s when I covered my eyes and my ears,” his daughter, Amber McGuire, told The New 
York Times. 
Fast forward a week, and now there’s a debate in Ohio 
over abolishing the death penalty. McGuire’s death has 
sparked a controversy about whether his punishment qualiﬁ  es as cruel and unusual, a violation of his Eighth Amendment right.
“He is being treated far more humanely than he treat-
ed her,” the victim’s family said in a statement after the execution. That sentiment is echoed in capital punish-
ment supporters around the country. 
The death penalty can seem rational. McGuire was 
convicted of raping a pregnant, newlywed woman and 
then stabbing her to death. In spite of that heinous crime, some still ﬁ  nd his punishment too harsh. 
The death penalty is difﬁ  cult to talk about. How can 
we, as a society, justify punishing crime with murder when it’s against the law in the ﬁ  rst place?
Capital punishment has been around for centuries. 
For some crimes, it may seem ﬁ  tting, becoming society’s method of retribution for the most disgusting of them. It’s easier to see, in these cases, why the death penalty is still used in 32 states.  
The death penalty was ruled unconstitutional for a 
period in the 1970s after the Supreme Court worried it was applied inconsistently. After more narrow deﬁ  ni-tions were drafted, executions resumed. Unfortunately, evidence 
shows that the death penalty is still applied inconsistently. Like many problems plaguing the U.S., it stems from systemic 
racism.
A 1990 report from the U.S. 
General Accounting ofﬁ  ce 
found a defendant was more likely to get the death penalty if 
the victim was white, which has been conﬁ  rmed through other studies. In fact, a 2007 study by Yale Law School on executions in Connecticut found African-American defendants receive the death penalty at triple the rate of 
white defendants when the victim is white.
Racial discrimination in sentencing isn’t the only 
problem here, either. Wrongful convictions are another 
important consideration when thinking about capital punishment. 
More than 130 people have been released from death 
row after proving their innocence.  On Amnesty Inter-national’s website, you can see some examples of how people were wrongfully accused. Prosecutors elicited 
false statements and withheld evidence that would sway 
the jury away from the death penalty.
Since 1976, more than 1,200 people have been execut-
ed. That means there’s roughly a one in 10 chance that someone on death row is innocent. This only includes data of those exonerated; it’s likely there are more who wrongfully die.
Even manufacturers of drugs used in lethal injections 
are stepping up against the death penalty. A new drug 
cocktail was used because the companies making the old 
drugs refused to allow their products to kill people.
Capital punishment is a complicated issue. But even 
though justice is blind, we don’t have to be. It’s impor-tant to remember that we are human, and we have no right to decide who lives and who dies.

Urban Thread announced 
Monday via Facebook that it will 
be moving to a new location.
Attracted to lower rent and 
better parking, owner Lilly Kline has chosen to move the store to a stand-alone building located at 1210 NW 23rd Ave., just a few minutes away from the current location.
Kline, who would regularly 
pass the vacant building, said it always looked sad, so she de-cided to renovate it and move her business there.
Known for its unique inven-
tory and quaint feel, fans of the store can still expect the same vibe but with a few changes.
“With lower rent, I can offer 
better prices to the customers,” Kline said.
Savings will also be passed on 
to customers through more fre-quent sales at the new location.
The current location will stay 
open during the move, and the new storefront will be open on Feb. 3.
During the move, customers 
can take advantage of the store’s moving sale. All shorts, Free People pants and Anthropologie clothing are currently 50 percent off.
Kline is planning a grand-
opening event with a 30 percent discount on all Free People mer-chandise. More details can be found on the store’s Facebook page.Kline has a few specific goals 
for growing the business within the next year but assures custom-ers the feel of the store won’t be compromised with the new loca-tion.
“I love when people come 
in and feel a sense of home in the store,” Kline said. “I always wanted a store that feels comfort-able and relaxed.” 
The relocated Urban Thread 
will still carry home goods and all of its current brands includ-ing Free People, Anthropologie and Saint & Noble, and will be bringing in new brands and in-ventory.
“I want to bring in other 
brands to complement what we already have,” she said. 
For the college fashionista, 
that means more vintage items.
Kline also said she plans to in-
corporate more social media into the store’s advertising plan by 
posting more frequently on Face-
book and Instagram. 
Janaye McGrew, a 22-year-old 
UF advertising senior, said she 
has been a frequent shopper at 
Urban Thread since she moved 
to Gainesville two years ago, 
and she plans to follow the store when it moves.
“I like shopping here be-
cause they have a different se-lection than most boutiques in 
Gainesville,” she said. “I also 
love the home goods.”THURSDAY, JANUARY 23, 2014

From flooding our feeds with 
album release dates to shamelessly 
countdown-ing singles, music art-ists have had to get more creative to get fans to actually buy their work. 
Here are the five most notable ways 
artists have dropped albums:
5. Radiohead: “In Rainbows”People love free stuff, so Radio-
head let the fans pick their price. Putting “In Rainbows” up for dona-tions, a majority took the band up on its offer. In addition to the fans 
who paid what they thought the 
album was worth, Radiohead also saw an increase in sales of previous albums. 
Radiohead went to No. 3 on Bill-
board’s Buzz 100 chart in 2007. 4. Arcade Fire: “Reflektor“Most of us like to keep tabs on 
our celebs, and Twitter can be a 
direct form of communication be-
tween you and your favorite artist. 
Arcade Fire took this communi-
cation one step further by announc-ing its second album to the world via a single reply to a fan’s tweet. 
Whoever got that initial tweet is 
still probably gloating. 
From there, the mystery only 
grew. 
Drawings of the same street art 
began to appear in cities all over, with “REFLEKTOR” written into the geometry of each design. 
On Aug. 26, a mural materialized 
on a building in downtown Man-hattan emblazoned with the words, “ARCADE FIRE 9 p.m. 9/9” fol-
lowed by four Reflektor patterns. 
The drawings worked. Arcade Fire’s “Reflektor” de-
buted as No. 1 on the Billboard top 
200 in 2013 and sold 140,000 copies in its first week.3. Kanye West: “Yeezus”If anyone would shamelessly 
countdown their album every day 
on Twitter, you would think it 
would be Kanye, right?
Surprisingly, no.Ditching the clear-cut path of self 
promotion, West dropped “Yeezus” after mismatched clues prior to its release. 
On May 1, fans only saw one 
cryptic tweet reading, “June Eigh-
teen.”  
On May 17, Kanye projected a 
new music video from “Yeezus,” 
which he only broadcast in 66 public, outdoor places around the world. 
He later performed two songs 
with his new musical style that shocked West fans on “SNL.” 
“Yeezus” was released in a plain 
Jewel CD case with no album art 
and no distractions from his music.
The album debuted at No. 1 on 
the Billboard top 200 in 2013 and 
sold 327,000 copies in its first week.2. Daft Punk: 
“Random Access Memories”
Instead of 
strictly using on-line ads and so-cial media, Daft Punk kicked it old 
school to reflect its new vibe. The band rolled out a series of tribute advertisements, with the first be-ing giant billboards in metropolitan 
cities showing its new logo. Then 
there was  a 15-second commercial 
during “SNL” previewing their new 
song, “Get Lucky.” The band aired two more commercials, one notably appearing randomly on main-stage screens at Coachella.
Information about the album 
was released little by little: first the 
names in April, then the single “Get 
Lucky” soon after, and finally a dig-
ital stream of the album on May 13.
The album was finally released 
on May 17 and sold 339,000 copies 
in its first week.1. Beyoncé: “Beyoncé”The queen works only with el-
egance. 
Queen B kept her poise and grace 
as she silently released arguably the most influential album of 2013 at the very end of the year.
The self-titled “Beyoncé” 
dropped without warning or an-nouncement. 
No tweets, no countdowns, no 
singles, no promotion at all.
And this was the best promotion 
she could have had.
The album, released on Dec. 13, 
sold more than 80,000 digital copies in the first three hours of the release, according to billboard.com.
A few things factor into the huge 
success of the artist’s fifth studio al-bum: strong themes of female em-
powerment, the concept of a visual 
album and the exclusiveness of the 
tracks the first week. No one could 
resist it. 
The album went on to sell 828,773 
copies over just the first weekend.

It was only a matter of time. The Barnes 
& Noble in Butler Plaza indeﬁ  nitely closed 
its doors to customers.
Lindsey Jones, a 22-year-old UF ﬁ  lm 
and media studies senior, said she was sur-
prised at how quickly Barnes & Noble had 
been erased.
“They came in like two to three days lat-
er and were already taking down all of the signs and had covered up all the windows, and it was just gone,” Jones said.
 Gainesville has many replacements to 
offer even though the well-known book-store has closed. These small, independent-ly owned stores still make books a priority. 
AThe Book Nook
1119 W. University Ave.
Nestled inside Video Rodeo, The Book 
Nook is one of many local book shops that offer an alternative to the dwindling com-mercial bookstores.
“I think it’s kinda cool that it’s here in 
the video store,” said Lindsey Freeman, a 22-year-old UF graphic design senior, browsing through the DVD selection. 
The Book Nook offers numerous shelves 
packed with books for purchase in a small space near the front of the store. Books range from used to new, theory to ﬁ  ction,  the Twilight series to “The Complete Works of William Shakespeare.”
A space to sit and read doesn’t exist 
in The Book Nook, but it’s worth a visit if you’re just looking to pick up something new.
BBroken Shelves
101 SE Second Place
For the past nine months, Broken Shelves 
has offered a cozy space with couches, chairs and high-top tables where guests can enjoy reading or conversing over a beer or 
glass of wine.
Co-owner of Broken Shelves, David As-
tor, 27, said the store is a small, collective social environment where people can come have a drink and talk.
“We wanted to have something for ev-
eryone, but have every book in the store be good and worth reading,” Astor said.
Broken Shelves is open daily from 5 p.m. 
to 11 p.m., but tends to close later on the weekends when guests prefer to stay.
CWild Iris
22 SE Fifth Ave.
Located near the Citizen’s Co-op and the 
Civic Media Center, Wild Iris is the only 
feminist bookstore left in Florida, according 
to its website. Since opening in 1992, Wild 
Iris has supported the feminist and LGBT community through the books it sells to the various events it hosts.
“We do a lot more than sell books,” said 
Leah Robbins, a Wild Iris employee and 
20-year-old UF Jewish and women’s studies 
sophomore. “We interact with people who 
have all sorts of identities.”
Robbins said Wild Iris is dedicated to 
raising consciousness about feminism and 
feminist politics. 
The books range from children’s books 
for queer couples to books about LGBT 
identities, relationships, rape and sexual abuse, recipes and spirituality. 
There are mostly new books with a shelf 
in the back dedicated to affordable used books.
D Book Gallery West
4121 NW 16th Blvd.
In the northwest side of town, you can 
poke your nose through some New York 
Times bestsellers as well as every genre you 
can imagine. 
Book Gallery West offers Gainesville res-
idents new and used books, gifts and cards.
Hailey Mawhinney, a 21-year-old UF 
English major and employee at Book Gal-lery West, said the bookstore offers a large ﬁ  ction section alongside a children’s and young adult section.
“We get a lot of old people that come in 
here and take advantage of our trade sys-tem,” Mawhinney said.Barnes & Noble closes, Gainesville offers book alternatives

“There’s a guy at school who keeps texting me and calling me. 
I want to be friends, but I’m not interested in him otherwise and 
don’t want to be rude. What should I do?” — Anonymous“How do I tell my friend that she has abandoned me for some 
loser guy with no prospects, and I am losing all faith in her…?” 
— Anonymous
I’m probably the wrong person to ask this question because I’m always the girl 
who doesn’t let ’em down easy, but I’ll try to be compassionate this once. If he’s 
your friend, he’ll understand. It sucks to be friendzoned — like, really sucks — if you want something more. But it would be worse if you kept this up by giving him the wrong impression. There’s no need to be rude. Don’t be like me. Just 
let him know you think he’s a seriously awesome guy (if that’s the case) but that 
you’re not looking for anything serious right now. Let’s hope he’s not a crier. But seriously, don’t ruin a friendship over a stupid relationship.This question hits a little too close to home for me. I’ve been through a similar situation 
and, yeah, it’s hard. Your gut instinct should be to stick beside her no matter what. I 
mean, she is your friend after all. My advice would be to sit her down and let her know how you feel. But I might omit the “I’m losing all faith in you” bit. Put it ALL on the table, but also understand that this might not make a difference in the situation whatsoever 
because she is obnoxiously blinded by love. 
You cannot make decisions for her: She’s a big girl, and she has to make her own 
choices and (let’s be real) mistakes. She’s not doing what she’s doing in spite of you. 
She’s doing it because, in some twisted way, it’s bringing her happiness. Instead of judging her, understand that she’s gotta do this for her, as cliche as that is. Talk to her — I mean really talk to her — and let her talk as well. Even if you don’t understand why she’s with this loser, still let her know you’ll be there for her if it goes sour — chances are it will. If it’s genuinely harming her in some way, though, you obviously have to intervene on a more severe level. But that’s just because you’re an awesome friend, 
so go you.ALYSSA HOLCOMB

At the Screen Actors Guild Awards, per-
formances take precedence over the usual 
awards season politics. This year’s 20th an-nual broadcast was no exception, with actors from both the film and television industries 
joining forces to celebrate the best perfor-
mances of the year.
What makes the SAG 
Awards stand out is that the statuettes are voted on by actors and also given to ac-tors. Fellow SAG members vote for their picks on the year’s top portrayals, which 
in turn makes a win that 
much more personal.
The cast of “American Hustle” took top 
honors with Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The David O. Rus-sell film is proving to be tough competition this season — the director isn’t sure if his film 
or “12 Years a Slave” will end up the overall victor come Oscar time.
Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto 
continued their winning streaks by taking home statuettes for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role and Sup-porting Role, respectively. Cate Blanchett also continued her sweep of awards this season for her leading role in “Blue Jasmine,” while Lupita Nyong’o took home Female Actor in a Supporting Role for “12 Years A Slave,” beat-ing out the likes of Julia Roberts and Jennifer Lawrence. Nyong’o even gave a shout out to her alma mater, Yale School of Drama, for her training —  props, theater kids.
Following their Golden Globe wins, Bryan 
Cranston and the cast of “Breaking Bad” won both Outstanding Performance by a Male Ac-tor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Perfor-mance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.
The television comedy categories show-
cased the stars’ stand-up skills. Julia Louis-Dreyfus got into character for her win for “Veep,” while one of her co-stars handed over 
note cards with the wrong acceptance speech.
Ty Burrell of “Modern Family” offered 
up five tips for actors during his acceptance 
speech, including “have no skill set other than being a needy extrovert.”
Throughout the night, videos of past reac-
tions and funny moments aired in between the presentations. Unlike some other awards shows, these seemed more heartfelt and fo-
cused on the actors themselves. It only added 
to the general warmth and acceptance of the night.
Stage and screen great Rita Moreno (aka 
Anita in “West Side Story”) took home the Lifetime Achievement Award after running a victory lap around the stage and partaking in an “Electric Company”-esque bit with Morgan Freeman. She even sang a few bars of “This Is 
All I Ask,” further proving her versatility.
Throw in some Emma Thompson pre-
speech dancing (and subsequent request for 
a CD version of the cheesy intro music), and you’ve got another awards show notched off the belt, people.

Less than half of all sexually active 
UF students used a condom the last time 
they had sex. 
According to the latest GatorWell 
Sexual Health Student Survey Report, 
only 47.2 percent used one for vaginal in-
tercourse. The percentage drops for oral 
and anal. 
What’s up with that, guys? Why is there no — excuse my pun — 
love for the glove?
Condoms are the Swiss Army knives 
of contraceptives. 
They do everything. Not only do they prevent pregnancy 
if used correctly, but they also protect against sexually transmitted infections. 
But there’s more to condoms than 
what you learned in sex ed. Yes, condoms allow you to have safe sex, but they also help you have satisfying sex. 
Condoms allow me personally to re-
lax and focus on my and my partner’s pleasure. 
I’m not worried about the potential for 
pregnancy or disease. 
It might be that I am too paranoid, but 
I wouldn’t be able to enjoy sex as much. 
I wouldn’t be thinking, “Yes! More! 
This is the best I’ve ever had!” if there wasn’t that safety net.
I think the inner dialogue would sound 
more like: “Don’t come yet! No, not in me! 
Not yet, please not on the sheets — I just 
washed those. Don’t come in me, don’t come in me, don’t come in me.”
Condoms are easy to use and incred-
ibly effective when used correctly. And — in my opinion — more fun. 
They usually have some sort of lubri-
cation, and the slick from that is generally good enough that there’s no need for an 
awkward, mood-killing Astroglide-grab 
from the nightstand. 
That lubrication goes a long way in 
making sex more comfortable for both partners, and good sex is all about com-fort.
If you need more than lube, or if plain-
Jane condoms don’t do it for you, there are many different types created just to 
help get you off. 
Sometimes — sorry, gentlemen — 
those ribs for her pleasure are really the 
make-or-break difference between an or-gasm and a disappointing night. 
Don’t think you’re left out, guys — 
condoms have some hidden powers for you, too. If you have a problem with, ahem, finishing too soon, condoms might 
reduce sensations and help you last lon-
ger. Trojan even sells special “climax control” condoms designed to prevent premature ejaculation.
Outside of penetrative sex, condoms 
work great for oral sex, too. 
Flavored condoms can mask the taste 
of your man-friend, who hasn’t showered in a few days, making it a lot more pleas-
ant to show your affection. 
Non-lubricated condoms can also be 
cut open for use as a dental dam, which 
acts as a barrier between the mouth and vagina or anus. 
There is no excuse for us, as college 
students, to not use condoms. They are practically shoved in our face in an effort to make sure we have safer sex. As long 
as you pay to go here, you might as well 
take advantage of the free condoms on campus.
Condoms can be found for free at the 
Student Infirmary, at the Planned Par-enthood on 13th Street and from various tabling groups like GatorWell and Voices for Planned Parenthood.
Even if you have to pay for condoms 
yourself, the few bucks you pay for a box is much cheaper than what you would pay for Plan B or — God forbid — a baby. 
So, don’t ruin your sheets, don’t get 
pregnant and definitely get that weird rash checked out. And please, for the sake of you and your partner, wear a rubber.Wrap it before you tap it pillow talk 
Each Thursday, the Avenue will dish out the best 
in entertainment. From the silver screen to hidden Internet gems, check out this week’s top picks.
Locally written, “The Peppermint King” will be at the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre. Set in the Ukraine in the 1920s, the show takes a twist and brings the audience to a magical land where everything is red and white. We don’t know too much about this play except it’s a “comic dystopian psychedelic fantasy,” and, hey, that’s reason enough for us to go. The show runs Friday to Feb. 9, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m. All tickets are $10 at Sweet Dreams or at the door 45 minutes before the show. Tickets can also be purchased online at acrosstown.org.

Florida’s two wins against 
Alabama last season were not 
easy victories by any means.
On March 2, 2013, the 
Gators trailed the Crimson Tide by eight points with 12:23 
left in the contest but then 
went on a 27-7 run to close out the game and win 64-52. 
Two weeks later in the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals, ‘Bama held a 37-27 advantage about 
four minutes into the second 
half. But Florida then out-scored Alabama by 20 again down the stretch to snatch a 
61-51 victory.
And tonight at 7 in Cole-man Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, Ala., the No. 6 Gators (15-2, 
4-0 SEC) will try to avoid fall-ing into a similar second-half hole against the Crimson Tide 
(8-9, 2-2 SEC).
“We obviously remember 
last year and know how good 
of a team they are,” senior for-
ward Will Yeguete said. “They 
are aggressive and have really good guards. They played us well. I think they are going to be ready to go especially be-
cause they are going to be at 
home and we are undefeated in conference play, so we are going to need to be ready to 
play.”
While UF has won its past 
nine games, ‘Bama has strug-
gled in SEC play with losses to Georgia (66-58) and Missouri 
(68-47). 
During its non-conference 
slate — a gauntlet featuring 
then-No. 6 Duke, then-No. 11 
Wichita State, UCLA, Xavier 
and Oklahoma — Alabama won only six of its 13 contests. But all of its non-conference losses came by 10 points or 
fewer.
“They’ve played the most 
difficult schedule of anybody

Elliott Orkin waited a long time to play college tennis, 
and he played a decisive role in his first collegiate dual 
match. 
Orkin won his singles match to clinch Florida’s season-
opening 5-2 win against North Florida at the Ring Tennis Complex on Wednesday. 
“It’s pretty awesome,” he said. “I’ve been waiting to 
play college tennis for many years now.” 
Florida started slow in doubles, dropping the point 
despite two matches going to a tiebreaker. Although the duo of Orkin and sophomore Gordon Watson came into the match ranked No. 13 in the nation, the twosome fell to the Ospreys’ Caio Gomes and Yannick Zuern in a quick 
6-2 decision. 
“We weren’t playing ag-
gressive enough” Orkin said. 
“We weren’t making balls that we normally make.”
The No. 43 doubles pairing of Mike Alford and Stepha-
ne Piro were also defeated by their UNF opponents, Nor-bert Nemcsek and Jack Findel-Hawkins, in a hard-fought 6-5 (4) tiebreak. 
The only match a Florida duo won was No. 3 doubles, which featured senior Florent Diep and freshman Maxx Lipman. 
The Florida tandem kept the match close with long ral-
lies and came away with a 7-4 tiebreak victory. 
On the singles court, Orkin stole the show. After los-
ing in doubles play, he took it upon himself to rack up 
a singles victory in a nearly two-hour match against Zu-
ern, winning 6-5, 2-6, 6-4 to guarantee the victory for the Gators.
Orkin said he knew what to expect and that he got tips 
from his older teammates going into the match. The fresh-
man entered the match ranked 53rd in the nation — the 
second-highest ranked player on the team — but said he had trouble loosening up.

The Gators’ Southeastern Conference 
schedule comes to a head tonight.
At 6:30 p.m., Florida will face conference 
rival No. 11 Tennessee on the road. In the 
49-game series leading up to tonight’s show-
down, the Volunteers are an astonishing 46-3 
against the Gators, who have won one game in 21 attempts in Knoxville, Tenn. 
Florida hopes to snap its current two-game 
skid, but that is going to be the tallest of orders in front of a energetic Volunteer crowd, whose average turnout is 11,402 per home game. 
“It’s very, very loud,” senior Jaterra Bonds 
said. “They’re going to be singing ‘Rocky Top’ 
all night long. It’s not going to be easy to play 
in, but you just got to keep your composure. 
“Anytime on the road is going to be hos-
tile — there’s going to be nasty fans, but you just can’t focus on that. Everybody’s going to make their runs and the crowd is going to be loud, but just staying together and staying composed is what’s going to get you through those types of moments.”
Practice this week is taking on a different 
spin for the Gators. The fundamentals of their game are surely being preached, but the en-vironment that awaits them is certainly being addressed. 
“I’m probably going to sing ‘Rocky Top’ 
during free throws and some other things to try and mess them up,” coach Amanda Butler said. “It’s one of those instances where you re-ally have to rely on your leadership, your old-er players, to convey to Ronni (Williams) and Gators look 
to end skid

UF coachCassie (Peoples) and some of the ones 
that haven’t been in that environment yet, of what it’s going to be like and what it’s going to take as a team and as a unit. How important our huddles are, 
how important our timeouts will be, 
and that we’ve got to come out of those timeouts the better team, and just really trying to block out the things that don’t have anything to do with us.”
Thompson–Boling Arena should be 
especially raucous on Thursday. The Volunteers are fresh off a loss to No. 2 Notre Dame, and legendary coach 
emeritus Pat Summitt will be in the 
building as a part of “We Back Pat” week — a week-long initiative that’s focused on bringing awareness and recognition to The Pat Summitt Foun-dation and its fight against Alzheimer’s disease. 
“Any team, when they’re coming 
off of a loss, is more dangerous,” red-
shirt sophomore Carlie Needles said. 
“They’re a little upset. They lost at home, which is very hard to do. Ten-nessee is a very tough, hostile environ-ment to play in. They might have a little chip on their shoulder, but there’s al-ways some chip on your shoulder after 
you lose. We’re just expecting their best 
play because everyone always plays their best against us.”
Butler and her Gators are prepared 
to enter the lion’s den, but the envi-ronment itself should not detract from Florida’s game plan. 
“The first thing we’ve got to do is 
be ready for that environment,” Butler 
said. 
“It’s loud, there’s going to be a whole 
bunch of people there, it’s ‘We Back Pat’ 
week. Pat will be there, so that adds to the energy. We’ve just got to be men-tally ready for all of those things.” 
in our league based on computer rankings and what 
other teams have done,” coach Billy Donovan said. “So I don’t think their record, per se, is any indication of 
what kind of team they are.”
While the Tide has failed to close out contests this 
year, the Gators have flourished, notching a 7-2 record 
in games decided by single digits.
“We’ve struggled to close games out that we’ve had 
opportunities in whether it be at home or on the road,” said Crimson Tide coach Anthony Grant, a former as-sistant of Donovan from 1996-2006.
“It’s a matter of our veterans have to step up and 
play like veterans when the game is on the line. Unfor-tunately, we haven’t had that consistently enough to be able to win some of those games.”
Senior guard Trevor Releford, who leads the team 
with 18.3 points and 33.6 minutes per game, has been the engine driving Alabama this season. In many as-pects, Releford’s elevated play in the backcourt has compensated for the loss of guard Trevor Lacey, the 
Crimson Tide’s second-leading scorer last year who 
transferred to NC State in the offseason.
“I don’t think he’s going to sneak up on anybody,” 
Donovan said of Releford. “He’s been clearly one of the best point guards in this league since he’s come in 
here.”
“I think any point guard, especially for them, a lot’s 
going to flow through him and the ball’s going to be in 
his hands a lot. 
“And he makes the game easier for (Rodney) Coo-
per, for (Shannon) Hale, for Nick Jacobs, for (Levi) Randolph. He makes the game easier for a lot of dif-ferent people. The most difficult part for him is when he is scoring and distributing, they become a very dif-
ficult team to defend.”Alabama senior

Florida lost the doubles point. Playing 
against Nemcsek on Court One, New-man regained momentum for Florida, 
picking up a decisive 6-4, 6-1 victory.
“It was a little bit nerve-wracking, 
but I was able to settle in and get the 
win,” Newman said.  
Diep was the second Gator to finish 
his singles action, notching his second victory of the evening against the Os-preys’ Zachary Goldberg in a quick 6-3, 6-2 match.
No. 116 ranked Mike Alford defeated 
Pablo Tellez 6-3, 6-4, and No. 28 Steph-ane Piro also gave the Gators a win, but Watson’s showing came as a surprise 
— the sophomore was the only Florida 
player to drop his singles match.Watson could not get any rallies go-
ing against Gomes in singles, falling 3-6 
in the first set before dropping a tie-
breaker in the second. 
“He had a tough match,” Shelton 
said. “The guy that he played was pret-
ty explosive and came out and got after 
him. 
“Gordon got control of the match in 
the second set and then wasn’t able to 
close it out.”

Every now and then, Grantland.com at-
tempts to write the worst sports column on Earth. Today, Adam will try, too.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said 
Monday the league might remove the point after touchdown.
Good, I say, and about time.The point after touchdown — or as I like 
to call it, beer-after-touchdown time — is atrocious.
The league should not be standing PAT on 
this issue. Kick this ancient rule to the curb.
I don’t pay exorbitant amounts of money 
to watch kickers — who barely qualify as athletes — kick the ball through the uprights with nearly 100 percent proﬁ  ciency. That’s boring.
I pay to see grown men hurl themselves 
at each other for my own personal entertain-ment. If I wanted to watch players kick the ball, I’d move to the United Kingdom and watch footy. 
Didn’t we have a war so we wouldn’t have 
to live that way? George Washington would despise the extra point. Papa George wanted things to be exciting. That’s why he made his men cross the Delaware River in the middle of the night.
But I digress. Good riddance to the extra 
point, and while we’re at it, I think there are a lot of rule changes that would make sports a 
lot more fun to watch.
First, we’ll take on my least favorite of 
the major American sports: basketball. In 
my opinion, basketball needs something to spice it up. Each score is nearly irrelevant on its own. If a team scores 80 points in a game, then any given two-point basket is worth ex-actly one-fortieth of a win.Compare that to baseball, 
where one run can be 100 per-cent of the score. It will almost never be fewer than 10 percent.
So let’s add some more im-
portant shots. 
Half-court shots are inﬁ  nitely 
harder than their three-point counterparts. They should be worth at least twice as much. Now, teams down by a couple normal baskets late can opt to attempt low-percentage shots that have a higher reward. Get 
those coaches’ brains cooking.
And can we stop pretend-
ing dunks aren’t the best type 
of scoring? They’re the most ex-citing plays in the game. Make them worth more than a measly two points. Give the fans a whiteboard and they can ﬁ  gure out how much the slam should be worth. Let the free market decide. 
While we’re on the topic of basketball, I 
think one of the best changes that should be made is adding hockey-esque line changes. No more of this “checking in” stuff when play stops. Have players come in and out at will. But the coach better make sure there are only ﬁ  ve on the court at any time!
As for baseball, which I think is unfairly 
criticized as being boring, there is one change 
I would make. 
National League, your resistance was cute, 
but it’s time to adopt the designated hitter.
Put your pitchforks down, NL fans. I’m 
just telling you the truth.
The fans want the long ball. No one likes 
1-0 pitchers’ duels. That’s just what baseball 
fans tell themselves so they can feel better while their pitcher fails to bunt three times in 
a row.
People don’t go to the ballpark to watch 
double switches. They want to see the ball 
leave the yard! Offense is king!
Know when baseball was at its peak? The 
1990s, when balls were ﬂ  ying out of ball-parks.
McGwire and Sosa, Bonds and Palmeiro. 
Just the names take me back to when I was 
young and the world was right. 
Now we’re supposedly in a new pitcher-
dominated age. Forget it. Give me massive 
sluggers walloping the ball 500 feet like it’s nothing. 
More home runs, and no extra points. 
That’s the kind of world I want to live in.NFL should end extra point, other sports’ rules should change
