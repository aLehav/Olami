Growing up in Tampa, Ph.D. 
candidate Ashley Boggs enjoyed 
Florida’s wildlife and often played 
with lizards and turtles. 
However, graduating to alliga-
tors didn’t cross her mind until later, she said.
“I never thought about the bigger 
animals like alligators,” Boggs said. 
“Other than canoeing down the Hillsborough River as a kid, I never 
really ran into them.”
Boggs now studies alligator 
growth at the Guillette Lab at UF to 
assess the effect of toxins on the ani-mals in the wild.
As an undergraduate zoology 
student, Boggs began volunteer-ing in the lab where she was paired with a graduate mentor, a position 
she now holds. 
The eggs used in her study were 
collected from Lake Woodruff, a 
relatively clean site, Lake Apopka, which is considered a contaminated 
area and their test site, near Kennedy 
Space Center in Cape Canaveral. 
“Everything that the embryo 
needs to develop is packed into the 
egg by the mother,” Boggs said. “We

Dana Carvey, of “Wayne’s World” fame, 
will perform at the Oct. 16 Gator Growl, or-
ganizers announced Monday.
Carvey was the second most popular 
comedian in the student poll conducted by 
Gator Growl staff earlier this year, said show 
spokesman Bryan Griffin. Jimmy Fallon got the most votes.
Other comedians on the ballot were Dar-
rell Hammond and Demetri Martin.
The poll received about 500 responses.Griffin said the staff tried to snag Fallon 
for the show, but his schedule didn’t allow it, likely because of his new NBC show “Late 
Night with Jimmy Fallon.”
Matt Sloan, the show’s producer, said 
staff aimed for a bigger name this time, not 
an up-and-comer like Jon Reep, last year’s headliner.
He said with the football team winning 
championships and the senior class one of the best in the nation, the staff felt Carvey was worth the extra money.
“We wanted to up our game because 
they upped their game,” he said, adding that 
he wasn’t able to release Carvey’s payment for the show because it hasn’t been finalized yet.
He said in recent years 
the show has alienated stu-dents.
“I feel like we’ve really 
lost a lot of traction with 
the students, and we’re trying to get that back.”
But it’s tricky picking acts, he said, be-
cause of the wide variety of people who attend the show — about 40,000 students, Carvey picked for Growl

The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment will request a murder charge 
against a former UF student after her boyfriend died from a gunshot wound to the head Monday after-
noon.
Yasmin Linder, 19, was arrested 
Sunday night and charged with at-
tempted murder after shooting Tor-rey Blalock, 20, at their apartment in The Estates, 3527 SW 20th Ave.
When Linder was booked at the 
Alachua County Jail, Blalock was in critical condition at Shands at UF. He 
died at about 3:40 p.m. Monday, said 
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg.
When officers arrived at the 
apartment Sunday night, they found Blalock unconscious but breathing on the floor of the bedroom, Kameg said.
According to Kameg, he was shot 
once above his left eye with a .22-cal-
iber semi-automatic handgun.
Linder told officials that after 
finding text messages Blalock sent 
to other women, 
she went into the 
bedroom closet with the gun and threatened to kill herself. Blalock 
then came into the 
closet, turned the gun toward him and told Linder to 
shoot him, according to the report.
After a brief struggle, Linder told 
police she pulled the trigger.
“We will be contacting the State 
Attorney’s Office and requesting 
for the charges to be changed or in-
creased from attempted murder to murder,” Kameg said.Former student may

A man was shot in the face by robbers at a 
Southwest Gainesville mobile home park Sat-
urday morning.
When deputies arrived to Cornerstone 
Mobile Home Park, they found Travis Gallon, 21, lying on the floor with a head wound, an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office release stat-ed. Six people were in the mobile home at 431 Squire Drive at about 2:30 a.m. when it was robbed. Witnesses told deputies that a party had just ended when two to three men kicked in the front door of the residence and de-manded money. The six people were ordered by the men to get on the floor, and Gallon was shot in the face, the release stated.
According to the release, Gallon was taken 
to a local hospital where he had emergency surgery for the gunshot wound. 
The suspects are described as medium-
build, black men. Two of the men were armed, and at least one had dreadlocks.

Elephants to crash Staples before Jackson memorial 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — As if 
the atmosphere outside the Sta-
ples Center didn’t promise to be 
circus-like enough come Tues-
day morning, they’re sending in the elephants.
A herd of 11 Asian elephants city, and Ringling Bros. arranged a permit with city Animal Ser-vices to usher them three miles 
from their train in Union Station 
to the arena.
Despite the memorial service 
and road closures near the Sta-
ples Center, the circus will use 
the same arena as the Jackson event. But the animals — which also include big cats — will be stowed in a barn until the crowds 
clear out, McWethy said.
Animal Services is working 
with the police department to 
escort the mammals during their 
march, which will begin at 3:30 
a.m. PDT and last for about two hours.

Recent UF graduate Amanda 
Boyd, 24, has pleaded no contest to 
a charge of DUI manslaughter for a 
crash on University Avenue in Sep-
tember.
The crash killed Gainesville resi-
dent Betty Hinson, 74.
Boyd, who graduated from UF 
in December with an economics 
degree, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.21, according to toxicology results described in a Florida Highway Pa-trol crash report. In Florida, a driver 
is considered impaired with a blood-
alcohol level of 0.08 or higher.
She was a senior at UF at the time of the crash.
Though she could have legally 
faced up to 15 years in prison and a 
$10,000 fine, the state has agreed to 
seek a penalty of no more than eight 
years in prison, according to court 
documents.
Boyd’s sentencing is scheduled 
for Aug. 14. 
At the sentencing, the victim’s 
family members will be allowed to 
describe the impact the crash has had on them, and Boyd will be al-
lowed to offer evidence to support 
their defense.
The minimum sentence Boyd 
could face is four years.
Under a deal formed between 
Boyd and the state, she will also 
serve probation.The probation length will depend 
on her prison sentence, totaling 15 
years between the two.
While on probation, she will not 
be permitted to drive a car or pos-sess or consume alcohol. She will 
also be required to wear an alcohol-
monitoring bracelet and may have to un-dergo mental health and substance-abuse 
counseling.
According to the FHP report, 
Boyd told officers she had one Mi-
chelob Ultra draft beer at the Ap-
plebee’s on Northwest 13th Street on 
the night of Sept. 21. She was unsure 
of the size of the beer, she said.
She had also taken Wellbutrin XL, prescribed for depression and anxiety, that morning.
Boyd said she had the beer 
around 4 p.m. and left Applebee’s between 5 and 5:30 p.m. to visit a friend in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., the report stated. About 15 minutes later, Boyd’s vehicle collided into 
Hinson’s after Boyd reportedly had 
trouble navigating around the curve 
at the intersection of East Univer-
sity Avenue and State Road 26, near Southeast 55th Street.
Boyd’s car struck the driver’s side 
of Hinson’s car at at least 54 mph, ac-cording to the report.
Boyd’s car then hit two road 
signs before flipping.
Boyd told officers she was trav-
eling between 45 and 50 mph, but 
speed calculations determined she 
was going at least 60 to 68 mph when she applied the brakes. The speed limit is 45 mph.
Hinson was pronounced dead at 
the scene. 
Paul Doering, UF pharmacy pro-
fessor, said Boyd’s 0.21 blood alco-hol level likely meant she had the equivalent of eight to 10 alcoholic 
drinks in her body at the time the 
sample was taken.
“That alcohol had to have come 
from somewhere,” he said. “And 
there just simply isn’t that much al-cohol in a Michelob Ultra draft, no matter what size it is.”
He also said Wellbutrin XL 
would not have affected her blood 
alcohol level.
One of Boyd’s two lawyers, Craig 
DeThomasis, declined to comment 
on the case until the sentencing was 
complete.UF grad pleads no contest to DUI manslaughter
� FLORIDA CONSISTENTLY RANKS 
AMONG WORST STATE IN COUNTRY.
By ROBERTA O. ROBERTS
Alligator Writer
Florida consistently ranks among the 
worst states in the country on issues such as 
child health and education, a position which 
Worst To First, a social action organization, 
seeks to reverse.Toward this goal, Worst to First is part-
nering with the Lawton Chiles Foundation to host the first Lawton Chiles Leadership Corp. conference. 
Gainesville’s Mayor Peegen Hanrahan is 
serving as an honorary director for the pro-
gram, which will take place Aug. 8 and 9 at 
the University of Central Florida.
Rising high school juniors, seniors and 
college students who attend will be taught how to organize educational funding aware-ness campaigns on their own campuses. “[State legislation] is dismantling uni-
versity education,” said Lawton “Bud” Chiles, founder of Worst to First. “Unless we take higher education funding more 
seriously, without public in-volvement, we will continue 
to see the degradation of these 
systems.”
UF students are already 
starting to take a stand for their education, such as when they held rallies against UF budget cuts, Chiles said.“We want to focus that energy to the 
almost 1,500 high schools and dozens of colleges in the state,” he said. “Because of their locations, these campuses affect every community in the state. By focusing around these campuses we will really affect the 
broader population.”
Chiles hopes to engage at least one mil-
lion Floridians to take action, because “right 
now, we’re spending more to lock up our teenagers than to graduate them,” Chiles said. Organization seeks to raise Fla. education rankings

■ SHE WILL BE THE COLLEGE’S 
FIRST FEMALE DEAN.
The College of Engineering announced 
a new dean on Monday — the first female 
dean in the history of the college.
Cammy Abernathy, who has been at 
UF since 1993, will take over on July 17, 
replacing Pramod Khargonekar, who just finished his eighth year as dean.
Khargonekar announced his resigna-
tion in late 2007. Due to budget uncertain-ties, the search process was cut short in March of 2008 and resumed in January.
“It’s not really about me,” Abernathy 
said of her selection as the first female dean in a UF news release. “It’s a sign of where engineering has to go in the future.We have to change the way engineering 
is perceived, and we have to change the 
way it is introduced to potential students. This 
is especially important because engineering — 
and educating the next 
generation of engineers — is so critical to our 
country today.”
Abernathy attended 
Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology as an undergraduate 
and earned her master’s and doctorate degrees at Stanford University. She also worked for AT&T Bell Laboratories, ac-cording to a memo sent to administrators Monday.
She is currently the associate dean for 
the Office of Academic Affairs and a pro-
fessor of materials science in the engineer-
ing college. Her husband, Steve Pearton, is a UF distinguished professor of materi-
als science and engineering.
Abernathy couldn’t be reached by 
press time, but Khargonekar’s salary is listed as about $302,000. Abernathy cur-
rently earns about $233,000, according to UF’s Web site.
Khargonekar said he plans to continue 
teaching and researching in the electrical and computer engineering department.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
URUMQI, China — Police have arrested 1,434 sus-
pects in connection with the worst ethnic violence in 
decades in China’s western Xinjiang region, which 
killed at least 156 people, state media reported Tues-
day.
The arrests come amid a security clampdown on 
the region, with hundreds of paramilitary police with 
shields, rifles and clubs taking control of the streets of 
the capital, Urumqi, where the riots took place on Sun-day.
The violence does not bode well for China’s efforts 
to mollify long-simmering ethnic tensions between the 
minority Uighur people and the ethnic Han Chinese in Xinjiang — a sprawling region three times the size of 
Texas that shares borders with Pakistan, Afghanistan and other Central Asian countries.
Mobile phone service and the social networking site 
Twitter have been blocked, and Internet links also were 
cut or slowed down.
A nonviolent protest by 200 people was broken up 
in a second city, Kashgar, and the official Xinhua News 
Agency said police had evidence that demonstrators 
were trying to organize more unrest in Kashgar, Yili 
and Aksu.
It said police had raided several groups plotting un-
rest in Dawan township in Urumqi, as well as at a for-mer race course that is home to a transient population.
The unrest in Urumqi began Sunday after 1,000 to 
3,000 protesters gathered at the People’s Square and protested the June 25 deaths of Uighur factory work-ers killed in a riot in southern China. Xinhua said two died; other sources put the figure higher. Internet and social networking reports on the incident had raised 
tensions in Xinjiang over the last two weeks.
Many Uighurs (pronounced WEE-gers) haven’t 
been wooed by the rapid economic development. Some 
want independence, while others feel they’re being 
marginalized in their homeland. The Han — China’s 
ethnic majority — have been flooding into Xinjiang as the region becomes more developed.
The government often says the Uighurs should 
be grateful for the roads, railways, schools, hospitals 
and oil fields it has been building in Xinjiang, a region 
known for scorching deserts and snowy mountain ranges.
A similar situation exists in Tibet, where a violent 
protest last year left many Tibetan communities living under clamped-down security ever since.INTERNATIONAL

Alligator Contributing Writer
Move over, quad latte.
Researchers at UF are devel-
oping a new caffeinated beverage that serves as a pick-me-up and an 
antioxidant.
Made from Yaupon Holly, a 
plant native to the southeastern 
United States, the drink resembles 
a beverage consumed by European 
explorers and the Timucua Ameri-
can Indians three centuries ago.
Yaupon Holly contains caf-
feine and antioxidants, said Matt 
Palumbo, who received a master’s 
degree from UF’s botany program 
and co-authored the UF study on the plant.
To formulate the drink, Palum-
bo cuts the leaves from the stems 
and places them on a heating skil-
let. Then he crushes the dry, crispy leaves with his bare hands before tossing them in a pot, adding boil-
ing water and letting them sim-
mer.
He said the taste of the dark 
brown drink is similar to green 
tea and could be especially popu-
lar among the health-conscious, 
though milk or sugar could be 
added to make it tastier. 
“It’s a matter of convincing people to drink something that 
might actually be good for them,” 
he said. 
Professor Linda Bobroff, who 
holds a doctorate in nutrition, said antioxidants help rid the body of 
free radicals that can build up and 
damage cells. They can be found 
mostly in green tea, fruits and veg-
etables, and it is believed that they can prevent cancer and aging, she said.
Focusing on a selectively bred 
cultivation of Yaupon called Nana, the researchers found it had about half the antioxidant content of green tea, according to the press 
release. 
On the other hand, the leaves 
only contained between 0.65 per-cent and 0.85 percent caffeine by 
weight. This is significantly less 
than coffee beans, which have 1.1 
percent, and tea leaves, which have 3.5 percent.
After using small quantities of nitrogen fertilizer, Nana produc-
tion increased by 35 percent, and 
caffeine content rose by 265 per-
cent, Palumbo said. However, an-
tioxidant quantity was unaffected.
Palumbo said negativity sur-
rounding the plant may have prevented it from widespread 
use. “Yaupon eaters,” a deroga-
tory term used in North Carolina, described someone who did not have enough money to buy high-
class products like coffee, Palumbo 
said. 
Palumbo also said the drink 
could have a social impact — hav-
ing a local caffeine source could al-
leviate pressure on coffee-farming 
regions worldwide.
Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia 
have faced high rates of deforesta-
tion due to coffee farming, he said.
“This is a way to expose Florid-
ians to a plant that can be grown in their backyard and that can pro-duce a tea that is caffeinated and 
has antioxidants,” he said. 
But Andres Duarte, UF aero-
space engineering major, said he 
would not replace coffee with any other caffeinated beverage. 
“I grew up with coffee, and that 
to me it is as important as drink-
ing water,” he said. “I just love the 
aroma and the taste.”UF RESEARCHCoffee may have competition

Today’s question: Was Sarah Palin’s resignation a good political move?Column
Sarah Spice
No explanation for 
Palin’s resignation
Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question is unavailable 
due to technical error.Hope for HondurasIf resigning from a post like governor of Alaska is hailed as 
a potentially “brilliant strategy” for a career, the Editorial Board might as well consider Sarah Palin the Geri Halliwell 
of the political world — Gubernatorial Spice, if you will. Not as catchy as “Killa from Wasilla,” but we’ve gotta keep it current.
Palin announced Friday that she will leave the governor’s 
office 18 months early, saying that she didn’t want to serve as a lame duck governor (she doesn’t plan on running for another term — hint, hint) and that she wanted to protect her family from media scrutiny.
The Editorial Board doesn’t understand what makes Palin 
believe that the end of her gubernatorial tenure will cause all media attention to cease and desist. For one, she is an extremely polarizing and captivating figure, the kind people will listen to 
even if they can’t stand him or her (sort of like Ann Coulter, 
except that she has  — or wait — had, a day job). Secondly, run-
ning for the leader of the free world is a pretty big deal.
Regardless, some politicians are saying the move could be a 
brilliant tactical maneuver that we just don’t “get” at this time.
We disagree, but with a tiny bit of reservation; the whole 
two-third-of-a-term-in-office-will-catapult-me-into-a-bigger-
office strategy seemed to work for Barack Obama.
But if Palin’s quitting parallels Ginger Spice, Obama is like 
the Michael Jordan of quitters in an I’m-so-good-at-everything-it-doesn’t-even-matter kind of way. We think Palin’s “strategy” will backfire (assuming she does plan on running for president in 2012), but, hey, maybe she’ll end up with four No.1 singles as a solo artist. Or, at the very least, because a source close to Palin told ABC News that the soon-to-be ex-governor was planning on campaigning for other candidates, Palin could parallel the quitting of Jerry Seinfeld and leave an illustrious, high-profile career for a job that is basically a “TV commercial star.” 
Overall, no one knows what will come of Palin’s resignation 
or which “famous quitter from history” she will resemble in a few years. But, if Karl Rove is left speechless by her “architec-tural” skills, her decision was probably not in the best interests of the Republican Party.
War-weary Americans turn to tabloids
Sometime last week in between the earth-shattering 
news that Michael Jackson, the OxiClean pitchman and Farrah Fawcett had all actually died within the 
same cosmic time frame, two significant news items went largely unnoticed.
First, on June 30, American forces officially withdrew 
from major cities in Iraq, giving control of security to the Iraqi National Guard. Sure, 130,000 troops may still re-main in the country, but for many Iraqis the day was one of celebration, a day of independence much like our own, marked with national flags and even parades. 
Around the same time, President Barack Obama’s 
administration deployed 21,000 additional troops to Af-ghanistan to stomp out Taliban resistance. In the period of a week, one war theater saw the cue for the end credits, and another theater found itself with a few thousand more 
moviegoers demanding more popcorn. 
Few Americans seem to notice the movement of hun-
dreds of thousands of their fellow citizens deployed abroad 
in the Middle East, anymore. And who could blame us? Cable news networks haven’t given much attention to Iraq or Afghanistan for a long time.
Instead, CNN, Fox News and the likes have all been 
playing to the ratings. The biggest shows on television right now: Death and Despair. This combination made the Iraq War the big ticket for cable news ratings, but now ce-lebrity deaths and the despair of our of economy are bring-ing in the dough. Jackson’s death has been given coverage even a pope can’t bring. Bernie Madoff, who, like the King of Pop, needs no introduction, gave news networks hours of airtime to first anticipate what the disgraced financier would receive for punishment and then to speculate how he would handle his 150-year sentence. 
For some, Madoff’s final judgment represented an al-most biblical reckoning. Madoff would be sacrificed for the sins of Wall Street, and money would again flow from the spigots of capitalism. Yet, when he was finally punished, nothing of great significance ensued to calm our financial worries. Ma-doff went to prison, his wife Ruth published a written statement and 
the world was still in a recession. 
The talking heads on television, the stately smiles 
in newspapers and the booming voices on talk radio all 
clamored for information that could somehow fuel their 
nonstop appetites, but news of an Afghanistan surge and the beginning of a long awaited Iraqi withdrawal did nothing for them. Then, speculation about Jackson’s drug 
abuse and on-call doctors erupted onto the scene, and the 
talking heads were once again saved. 
It seems that we no longer live in a post-Sept. 11 world. 
News about a war abroad no longer takes precedence in 
headlines, and our enemies are no longer turban wearing fundamentalists, but greedy and unprincipled financiers. The Age of Osama has been replaced by the Age of Bernie, and few have noticed. 
Perhaps it’s because we’re tired of war, or because our 
shrinking pocketbook really hits home. But for millions of Americans, the wars overseas are not mere side notes but a terrible reality. Yet, in between the circus that has been South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford’s “Appalachian Trail” hike, Madoff’s sentencing, and Jackson’s death, our national appetite for tabloid fodder has hit the fan.

letters@alligator.org The Editorial Board 
would like to make note of the political crisis in 
Honduras, an event upset-ting the lives of millions of the 
country’s citizens.
The Honduran coup took 
place after now-ousted Presi-
dent Manuel Zelaya conduct-ed a public poll on whether or not to vote to change the country’s constitution. Pro-posing a change was ruled unconstitutional by the Hon-
duran Supreme Court, and 
so Zelaya was placed under arrest and exiled.
The Editorial Board would 
like to point out the hypocrisy in this chain of events. Zelaya was not attempting to alter the constitution himself but rather asked the public’s opinion. A 
rule that declares proposing 
constitutional changes as il-legal seems like a convenient excuse for a coup and, worse, anathema to democracy.
After the coup, the new 
leaders stated that Hondu-
ras was now safe from Hugo 
Chavez. This statement un-derlined the real reason for the coup: Zelaya’s leftist stance as opposed to that of the hard-liners who got rid of him. A broken rule, which ul-timately amounted to nothing more than the stating of an 
opinion, should not be used 
as an excuse.
We would like to express 
our hope that this situation is quickly resolved. After Zelaya returns, if his opponents want him out of office, then let it be done by a vote in the demo-cratic way. After all, Hondu-
ras is a democracy, and opin-
ion is not thought crime.TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 7
UF should keep station
While I understand that 
our slowing economy forces 
even UF to make difficult cut-
backs, I do not understand 
why the leaders of our largest employer in Alachua County have to behave like any other 
arrogant, big-city CEOs when 
considering the fates of em-ployees. I am particularly up-set about the recent treatment of the staff of WRUF.
WRUF offers UF students 
the opportunity to work in a real-world business and cre-ative environment while they 
study. While no one is above 
being considered for cutbacks, WRUF is a strange place to be-gin looking because it funds itself through revenue gener-
ated by commercials, unlike 
many other branches of UF.Nonetheless, the UF em-
ployees who maintain these operations have been told they will soon learn who among them is losing his or her job, as 
WRUF has been targeted for 
layoffs.
While layoffs at WRUF are 
upsetting, that is not what moved me to write this letter.
What is truly upsetting is 
the fact that these employees 
will learn their fates from a 
group earning combined sala-ries of at least $200,000. Also, this expense is being held 
against WRUF.
Why does UF have hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars 
to spend freely on consultants, 
but it cannot shield the jobs of 
15-plus-year employees from this economic downturn?

Jacksonville residentSo if any of you are like me, you’re probably an 
incredibly lazy person. And I don’t mean ordi-nary, run-of the-mill lazy — I mean you elevate 
it to an art form. There’s nothing wrong with laziness, by the way, so don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. 
Laziness — the desire to exert the least possible ef-
fort — has given rise to our most wonderful human ingenuities. If someone hadn’t been too lazy to walk, we probably wouldn’t have cars. If someone hadn’t been too lazy to try and make a genuine connection with a woman, we probably wouldn’t have such bril-liant pick up lines as “Was your dad a baker, because your buns are out of this world!” The bottom line is that laziness keeps us sharp. Because of it we are ev-
er-vigilant for the next thing that will make our lives 
easier and, in our own twisted way, richer.
In that same vein, I’ve recently found a Web site 
that has become my own labor-saving Mecca. Life-hacker.com, created in January of 2005, is a brilliant spot to find tips to make your life less draining. The advice and wisdom distributed on Lifehacker runs from the sort of esoteric thing that you’ll only use once in your life to stunningly simple little ideas that you’ll 
kick yourself for having never thought of before. For 
example, I’ve always been far too lazy to sit through movie credits in hopes of some funny after-credits scene — well, thanks to Lifehacker, I’ve now discov-ered MovieStinger.com, which tells whether a movie has anything worth watching after the credits. More than that, I was also turned on to Runpee.com. Tired of sitting in a movie theater staring sullenly at your emp-tied large soda while you furi-ously cross and uncross your legs, desperately needing a 
bathroom break but unwilling 
to miss any of the riveting ac-tion of the cinema?
Well, some latter-day Edi-
son has solved that problem. 
Runpee.com lists all the movies in theaters and sug-gests points during the movie at which you should, well, run and pee, without missing anything too im-portant or awesome. It even tells you how long you 
have until the movie picks back up again, and what 
you’ll be missing while you’re gone. 
This is just one of the brilliant tips I found on 
Lifehacker, and I regret not having discovered this hub of labor-savers sooner. Other wisdom waiting to be mulled over by those bold enough to seek it out include things like “how to have fresh baked bread in five minutes,”and, my personal favorite, “amplify your speakerphone with a cereal bowl.”
Some of the tips might not strike you as imme-
diately helpful — but on that one absurd day when you need to amplify your speakerphone and all you have handy is a cereal bowl, all of the sudden you’ll be MacGyver!

 A group of UF architecture seniors presents its year 
2000 projection of development in Gainesville and at UF 
to the Chamber of Commerce Gainesville Redevelopment Council.
According to the students, Gainesville will be “a sky-
line of open-air megastructures, each of which constitutes a town and neighborhood within the city, connected by a streamlined monorail that provides speedy access to each of the towns,” by the turn of the millennia, according to Alligator archives.
The goal was to control the city’s growth into a planned 
and manageable metropolis, shifting away from the uncon-trolled sprawl, which continues to be a problem for local developer’s today.
“The model is certainly exciting and feasible and is nec-
essary for the future,” Commissioner Joe Little had said at the meeting.  
July 10, 1973: 
 Dr. Robert Cade, who developed Gatorade in 1965, is 
busy promoting Super-Gator, a yellowish drink similar to orange juice.
The product, designed as a breakfast protein supple-
ment, contains “one-half the daily adult requirement for protein,” according to Cade’s claims.
Cade has also invented a hydraulic football helmet, a 
protein-infused milk product called Gator Go! and Hop N’ Gator, a beer-like drink that the body absorbs quickly to get partiers drunk faster and sober sooner.

 MIAMI — Hondurans in the 
U.S. organized rallies Tuesday 
supporting the ouster of Hon-
duran President Manuel Zelaya, even as Zelaya prepared to re-turn to his country accompanied 
by U.N. ofﬁ  cials.
A group of about 100 demon-
strators gathered Tuesday out-
side the Honduran Consulate in Atlanta.
In Florida, home to the na-
tion’s largest Honduran com-munity, organizers staged rallies Monday in Miami to show their 
support for the new government. 
Another rally was scheduled for Wednesday in Tampa. And still another demonstration was scheduled over the weekend for 
New York.
“The situation is complex. For the world, for those who aren’t Honduran, it’s worrying that the 
military ousted Zelaya and four hours later there was a new pres-ident,” said Jose Lagos, head of 
the Miami-based nonproﬁ  t Hon-
duran Unity. “But there was no other path. Unfortunately, Presi-dent Zelaya himself created this situation,” he said.
Lagos maintained the inter-
national media are misinformed about what led to Zelaya’s exile. 
He says Zelaya was trying to vio-
late the Honduras constitution by seeking to extend his rule. Hondurans praise

 KEY WEST — A fugitive who 
was shot in the Florida Keys after 
confronting law ofﬁ  cers with an as-sault riﬂ  e pleaded guilty Monday 
to charges stemming from that case 
and to environmental charges he faced in Utah.
Larkin Baggett, 55, was shot and 
wounded March 10 when federal agents and local sheriff’s deputies arrested him at a marina in the Keys town of Marathon. Baggett was among the most-wanted environ-mental offenders sought by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
The EPA began publishing the list of fugitives last year.Court records show that Bag-
gett brandished a .308-caliber Bush-master assault riﬂ  e at ofﬁ  cers and ignored commands to show his hands.
“He was heard to state words to 
the effect ‘I won’t go’ and ‘take this’ 
as he attempted to raise the assault 
riﬂ  e to ﬁ  ring position, 
sweeping the bar-rel toward several of the exposed agents,” prosecutors said in 
one court document.
After Baggett was shot twice and 
wounded, ofﬁ  cers found four riﬂ  es 
and four handguns in his travel 
trailer. The assault riﬂ  e had two ful-ly loaded 30-round magazines.
Baggett pleaded guilty to four 
counts of assaulting a law enforce-ment ofﬁ  cer with a deadly weapon and one count of being a fugitive in possession of a ﬁ  rearm. He also pleaded guilty to the original Utah charges of violating the federal Clean Water Act and illegally disposing of hazardous waste.
The combined charges carry a 
maximum prison sentence of 98 years. U.S. District Judge K. Michael 
Moore set sentencing for Oct. 14.
Baggett ﬂ  ed Utah before his 
scheduled June 2008 trial on charges 
that his company, Chemical Consul-tants Inc. of North Salt Lake dumped hazardous chemicals into drains, a paved alley and into grates leading to a sewer district.
After appearing on the EPA’s 
wanted list, court records show that Baggett bought a satellite phone that agents were able to trace to locations in Marathon. Baggett had a copy of The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper containing a story about him in his truck when he was arrested, pros-ecutors said.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Gov. Sarah Palin spent 
Monday ﬁ  shing with her family and away from the spotlight as her lawyer insisted that legal troubles did not drive her to announce her stunning resignation over the holiday weekend.
Palin’s early departure has fueled rumors that some 
legal entanglement not yet known to the public may have compelled her to resign. Sixteen ethics complaints have been ﬁ  led against Palin in the last year, most of which have been dismissed as baseless.
But Palin’s lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, said the Re-
publican governor and former vice presidential candi-date has no legal problems whatsoever.
In an interview with The Associated Press, he said 
that Palin believes that the hostile political climate and legal bills have become too much of a distraction for the state.
“She is leaving now because I think she believes that 
she has become the issue, rightly or wrongly, with all these ethics complaints and with the issues involving the Legislature, the combativeness they’ve been dem-onstrating toward her since she returned from the cam-paign,” Van Flein said of Palin, still widely believed to be a possible presidential candidate in 2012.
“I think she believes it’s in the best interest of the 
state to progress forward, for her to move on to other issues.”
Palin has become a lightning rod for partisan politics 
in Alaska since her return from the 2008 presidential 
campaign after John McCain select-ed her as his running mate. She has racked up an estimated $500,000 in le-gal bills defending the ﬂ  urry of ethics complaints, including one ﬁ  led Mon-
day that alleges she is violating eth-
ics law by taking per diem payments 
when she stays in her Wasilla home instead of the governor’s mansion in Juneau.
In addition, her relationship with Senate Democrats 
— once among her staunchest allies — deteriorated in the last session.
Palin has made only one brief public appearance — 
watching part of the July 4th parade in Juneau — since her bombshell announcement Friday that she will resign from ofﬁ  ce at the end of the month. She is scheduled to appear at a bill-signing on Tuesday in Kotzebue, an Alaska village north of the Arctic circle.NATIONALPalin’s departure sparks rumors

ORLANDO — A witness to the 
monorail accident that killed a train 
operator at Walt Disney World over the weekend described it in a 911 call released Monday as “a head-on 
collision” between two trains.
“A monorail was waiting to 
come into the station ... or it did not 
leave the station, and the other one cleared through the station, and there was a head-on collision,” the male caller said.
The accident occurred as the park 
resort was closing early Sunday and 
one train was being transferred off 
the rail line, said Zoraya Suarez, a Disney spokeswoman. She declined to describe the circumstances of the crash further.
Austin Wuennenberg, 21, died of 
multiple traumatic injuries in what’s being considered an accident, said Sheri Blanton, a spokeswoman for 
the medical examiner’s office in Or-
lando.
The Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration said Mon-day it will investigate whether workplace safety rules were broken before one monorail train crashed into another, said Mike D’Aquino, a spokesman in Atlanta for the federal 
agency. The investigation could take 
as long as six months.
If citations are issued, Disney

IMPROVE U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS.

MOSCOW — Presidents Barack Obama and 
Dmitry Medvedev confidently committed to a year-end deal to slash nuclear stockpiles by about a third on Monday, but the U.S. leader failed to crack stubborn Kremlin objections to America’s missile defense plans — a major stumbling block to such an agreement.
Both men renewed pledges to pull U.S.-Rus-
sian relations out of the dismal state into which they had descended during the eight years of the Bush administration. And to that end, they signed a series of agreements and joint state-ments designed to enliven and quicken contacts on a broad range of issues — including coop-eration on Afghanistan, a key Obama foreign policy objective.
Obama said the leaders both felt relations 
had “suffered from a sense of drift. President Medvedev and I are committed to leaving be-hind the suspicion and rivalry of the past.”
His host expressed similar good will.“This is the first but very important step in 
improving full-scale cooperation between our two countries, which would go to the benefit 
of both states,” the Russian leader said. But he 
injected a note of caution, saying discussions so far “cannot remove the burden of all the prob-
lems.”
There was no statement of Russian readiness 
to help the United States persuade Iran to aban-
don its nuclear ambitions, even though Obama’s top Russia adviser, Michael McFaul, told report-
ers in a post-meeting briefing that Iran dominat-
ed the two leaders’ private 
meeting that opened the 
summit. Talks continued in an expanded session that 
included 12 advisers for each president.
For all the upbeat public statements, a pall 
of disagreement on missile defense and NATO expansion lingered over the glittering Kremlin hall where Obama and Medvedev answered 
reporters’ questions. Obama said the meetings 
had been “frank,” diplomatic speak for diffi-
cult.
Obama sits down on Tuesday with Med-
vedev’s patron and predecessor as president, 
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the target of a 
verbal poke from the U.S. president last Friday.

In particular, Boggs is curious to see what 
effects the space center may have on the alli-
gators.
“[Cape Canaveral] is still fairly wild, and 
there’s a decent sized alligator population out there. We’ve been looking at chemicals like 
flame retardants, heavy metals and perchlo-
rate, which makes up a large part of rocket 
fuel,” Boggs said. 
According to Boggs, some of these chemi-
cals can reduce the production of thyroid hor-mone, which alters metabolism and develop-ment.
High levels of perchlorate have not yet 
been detected in the area. The chemical has a 
very hot, intense burn, and most of it may be 
burned up during launches, with little of it es-caping into the environment when the shuttle 
takes off, Boggs said.
However, perchlorate may enter surround-
ing waterways at other points on the space 
center.
“We’re very interested in the areas where 
they’re washing the shuttles down afterwards or maybe where they’re loading or unloading the fuel, and there might be some sort of spill-age there,” Boggs said. 
Once the eggs were collected, Boggs’ job 
was to make sure that all of the eggs, and the alligators hatching from them, experienced the exact same conditions.
The more than 250 alligators being studied 
are housed in greenhouses on the rooftops of 
Bartram and Carr halls. All reptiles are packed in about six tubs, which resemble the natural crowding behavior of young alligators in the 
wild.
Boggs records each alligator’s length every 
two weeks, first measuring from snout to tail 
and again without the tail.
“This is more indicative of their actual 
length because tail size can vary,” Boggs said. 
Finally Boggs takes the weight and mea-
sures the tail girth; the size of the tail girth is generally an indication of health. 
“There is a wide difference in the growth 
rates of these animals. Whether or not it’s sig-
nificant from lake to lake, we don’t know yet. 
But just visually we know that some animals 
aren’t doing as well as others,” Boggs said.
The alligators are almost one year old, and 
the largest are around two feet, the smallest are less than half that size.
To prevent bias in the study, Boggs is pur-
posely unaware of the origins of any particu-lar alligator, however each alligator was fitted 
with an electronic chip so that data can be 
stored on a computer system. 
When the study is complete, she will look at 
the computer and be able to match the groups of alligators with their original home. 
Alligators were chosen as the subject of this 
study because they are a “sentinel species.”
“They can tell us things about the environ-
ment. They’re kind of like our watch dogs,” Boggs said.
Because alligators are aquatic, any toxins in 
the water will end up in them. Additionally, alligators eat a lot of fish, which increases their exposure to contaminants.
The irony of a UF Gator working with al-
ligators has not been lost on Boggs.“It’s a joke that I have to deal with a lot,” 
she said. “Really the benefit of being in Florida is being in an environment where my study species is easily accessible.”
Two of the most important things that 
Boggs has learned while studying alligators 
are confidence and respect.
“You can’t hesitate and be scared when 
you’re out there trying to catch an alligator,” 
she said.
On the other hand, the creatures command respect.
“You just have to understand that this is 
a powerful animal and even though you get 
used to handling them, they’re still wild,” Boggs said.
But, Boggs sees her work extending be-
yond alligators.
“What we do to the environment, we’re 
doing to ourselves as well. There’s not a sepa-
ration between the two; we are a part of our 
environment,” Boggs said.10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2009

KABUL (AP) — Bombs and bul-
lets killed seven American troops 
on Monday, the deadliest day for 
U.S. forces in Afghanistan in nearly 
a year — and a sign that the war be-
ing fought in the Taliban heartland 
of the south and east could now be expanding north.
Separately, Taliban militants 
claimed on a militant Web site that they were holding an American sol-dier whom the U.S. military says insurgents might have captured 
last week. The Taliban statement, 
however, did not include any proof, such as a picture or the soldier’s name.
Four of the deaths Monday 
came in an attack on a team of U.S. military trainers in the relatively peaceful north, bringing into focus the question of whether the U.S. is committing enough troops to se-
cure a country larger than Iraq in 
both population and land mass.
On a visit to Moscow, President 
Barack Obama said it’s too soon 
to measure the success of his new 
strategy in Afghanistan. He said the U.S. can take another look at the 
situation after the country’s presi-dential elections on Aug. 20.
Russian President Dmitry Med-
vedev said in some respects, prog-ress has been “insignificant” in Afghanistan. He said it’s hard to 
say how quickly the situation will improve.
Obama has ordered 21,000 addi-
tional American troops to this coun-try, mainly in the south where Tali-
ban militants have made a violent comeback after a U.S.-led coalition topped them from power in late 2001. The U.S. expects 68,000 troops 
here by year’s end, double last 
year’s total but still half as many as now in Iraq.The four American soldiers 
killed in the north died in a roadside bombing of their vehicle in Kunduz 
province, said Navy Chief Petty 
Officer Brian Naranjo, a U.S. mili-tary spokesman. The soldiers were training Afghan forces, he said.
Two Americans were killed in a 
roadside blast in southern Afghani-stan, Naranjo said. And another American soldier died of wounds in a Monday firefight with militants in the east, a U.S. military spokes-man said.
There were no further details on 
the incidents in the south and the east.
It was the deadliest day for 
American troops in Afghanistan 
since July 13, 2008, when 10 soldiers 
were killed — nine of them when militants using small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades attacked a remote outpost in the village of Wanat near the Pakistani border.
The Taliban claim about hold-
ing a captured U.S. soldier came six days after a soldier was noticed missing during a routine check of his unit June 30. His body armor 
and weapon were found on the 
base.
Two U.S. defense sources have 
said the soldier “just walked off” post with three Afghans after he finished working. They had no ex-planation for why he left.
In southern Afghanistan, mean-
while, thousands of U.S. Marines continued with their anti-Taliban offensive in Helmand province. Some 500 Marines out of 4,000 par-ticipating in the operation moved 
into the Khan Neshin area, a Ma-
rine statement said Monday.
“This is the first time coalition 
forces have had a sustained pres-ence so far south in the Helmand 
River valley. Khan Neshin had been 
a Taliban stronghold for several years before Afghan, and coalition forces arrived and began discus-sions with local leaders several days 
ago,” the statement added.
In the southern province of Kan-
dahar, meanwhile, a suicide car 
bomber blew himself up outside the outer gate of the main NATO base in the region, killing two civilians 
and wounding 14 other people.
Those wounded near the gates 
of Kandahar Airfield included 12 
civilians and two Afghan soldiers, said Gen. Sher Mohammad Zazai, 
the top military commander for 
southern Afghanistan.7 U.S. troops killed throughout Afghanistan Monday12, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2009

on, who can opt out of his Heat contract after the 2009-10 season, said Monday that simply getting to the playoffs “is not enough” to satisfy him anymore, and that his long-term commitment to Miami hinges entirely on the franchise getting back into the mix for the title trophy he hoisted just three years ago.
“I’m going to listen. I owe the Miami 
Heat that much. I’m going to listen to what they have to say, and I’m going to think about it,” Wade told The As-sociated Press. “But right now, the way I feel, I want to make sure that we’re on track to where I want us to be on track to before I sign back.”
Wade made it clear that he would 
like to stay with the Heat, reiterating something he has said countless times in recent months. There’s no acrimony between the 2006 NBA Finals MVP and Heat president Pat Riley either, and Wade said that the jump Miami made this past season — from 15 wins and the league’s worst record in 2007-08 to 43 wins and the No. 5 seed in the East in 2008-09 — was thrilling.
“I’m good with that,” Wade said, 
“for one year.”
Another season around .500, though, 
won’t be as enticing.
“That’s not enough for me,” said 
Wade, who set career bests last season in scoring average (30.2 per game), 3-pointers (88, three more than his total from his first five NBA seasons com-bined), steals (2.2 per game), blocks (1.3 per game) and games played (79).
At 27, he feels like he’s just entering 
his prime — and doesn’t want to miss any opportunity for more titles.
“I’ve told coach Riley this: All my 
life, all I’ve ever wanted to do is win and be put in a position where I can win and succeed,” Wade said. “Build me a team. Put the pressure on me to win a championship. Give me a team and say, ‘All right, you’ve got to go do it,’ and I’ll take that pressure. Give me guys that we feel can compete every 
year to win a championship. I don’t 
want to go anywhere else.”
Wade’s contract status is the biggest 
issue facing the Heat this summer. He 
could sign an extension as early as next 
week.
His destination after next season has 
been an oft-discussed topic, especially 
since he and good friend LeBron James 
structured their last contracts the same 
way to have the flexibility to become 
free agents in 2010.
“I want to make sure that we stay 
competitive and we have an opportu-
nity to win championships, like I’ve 
done before,” Wade said. “I don’t want 
to be content with winning games. I don’t want to win games. I want to win championships. That’s what I’m all 
about.”
Already this summer, the Heat have 
seen plenty of teams in the East make 
big moves. Shaquille O’Neal — Wade’s former superstar teammate — was traded to Cleveland to play alongside James. Orlando landed Vince Carter, Boston reportedly agreed to a deal with Rasheed Wallace, Detroit picked up Ben Gordon and Toronto seems poised to sign Hedo Turkoglu.
The Heat have yet to make a 
splashy move, hoping young players like Michael Beasley, Mario Chalmers, Daequan Cook and Dorell Wright can help Miami make more strides this sea-son.
“D-Wade wants what’s best for the 
Miami Heat, period,” former Heat cen-ter Alonzo Mourning said last week. “Obviously, he wants more help for the Heat to get to that next level again. He feels like we’ve got good pieces around us. We just need a little bit more.”
Wade sees it the same way.“My talents can help a team com-
pete for a championship,” Wade said. “I’ve proven that.”NBAWade’s future depends 
on Heat vying for ring
No matter which players take the 
field, what year it is or which sport is being played, rivalries will al-
ways exist in college sports. 
It’s what truly sets them apart from pro 
sports — the players may not always be the same, but the emotions are unchanged. 
In the big leagues, teams’ identities often 
change as players come and go, and ri-valries tend to transform as the balance of power shifts.
In college, though, that’s not generally 
the case. The only thing that can really dis-solve a rivalry is when the teams no longer play on a regular basis. It doesn’t matter if Michigan’s football team is having a down 
year — the Wolverines will always be ready 
to play their best game when Ohio State comes to town. The same goes for Duke and North Carolina in basketball or Alabama and Auburn on the gridiron.
The UF football team is particularly in-
teresting when it comes to this topic. ESPN’s Pat 
Forde wrote about the hottest rivalries 
in college football 
right now, and the Gators had two ap-pearances in the top 
three spots: against 
Tennessee at No. 2 and against Georgia at No. 3. 
So even without mentioning one of the 
biggest in-state rivalries in the country in any sport, UF will play two of the most an-ticipated games when the college football season starts in just under two months. 
The Gators have a number of strong ri-
valries in every sport — not just football — for a number of reasons. First of all, the Southeastern Conference breeds intense competition. Football is a religion in the 
south, a way of life for many people. Sec-Ranking UF’s rivalries: FSU,

Lance Armstrong reacts as he rides during the third stage of the Tour de France on Monday. It covered 
196.5 kilometers (122 miles), which started in Marseille and finished in La Grande-Motte, France. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LA GRANDE-MOTTE, France — 
If age is Lance Armstrong’s enemy, 
then experience is his friend.
With a savvy sense of the pack 
and a touch of luck, the 37-year-old 
Texan surprised some of the young-
er Tour de France contenders Mon-day to move within striking distance of the yellow jersey.
He made up for what his legs 
lack in power with road smarts dur-ing the breezy third stage along the Mediterranean, rising from 10th to third place.
Armstrong hitched a ride with a 
breakaway group led by old sidekick George Hincapie’s Team Columbia. Mark Cavendish, a Columbia rider from Britain, won the stage for the second straight day. Race leader Fa-bian Cancellara of Switzerland kept the yellow jersey for the third day in a row. The Swiss rider with Saxo Bank extended his lead and is ahead of Tony Martin of Germany by 33 
seconds and Armstrong by 40.
Most of the favorites were 
trapped by the wind during the 
122-mile ride from Marseille to La Grande-Motte. Sensing the gusts were causing havoc ahead of a turn with about 18 miles to go, Arm-strong simply stayed in front, out-foxing riders like Alberto Contador of Spain, the 2007 Tour winner and 
favorite this year.
“Good positioning, experience, 
a little bit of luck,” Armstrong said. 
“Just before that corner I was 20 guys back, and I decided just that idea to move up enough to be on their wheel. And there it went.”CYCLINGArmstrong moves 
into third at Tour
ond, all three in-state college sports power-
houses — UF, FSU and Miami — have been rivals with each other at some point or an-
other. Although the UF-UM relationship has 
dulled recently, it had its moments.
So, UF is in an overly competitive con-
ference and an overly competitive state, 
and rivalries are generally built by either 
geographical convenience or in-conference power struggles. 
We discussed this issue on the alligator-
Sports Podcast way back on April 14, and 
none of the four participants had identical 
lists of UF’s top three rivals.  
That’s what makes this topic interest-
ing: Everyone has different qualifications in terms of what makes a great rivalry. 
For some, football is king, and everything 
else is secondary. For others, the schools 
must be competitive in every sport. For 
some, in-state rivalries are more compelling because of the competing fans and the fact that many of the players grew up together. For others, conference matchups matter 
more simply because they have a larger im-
pact on the team’s postseason destiny. For some, it’s all about how much history the schools have. For others, today’s hottest ri-
valries are more interesting because they are 
shaping the future.
I tried to take all that into account when 
making this list of UF’s top three rivals:
1) FSU: To me, this will never be toppled. It 
has the right combination of all of the above factors, with the obvious exception of the conference rivalry. It doesn’t matter if it’s football or tennis — players, coaches and 
fans on both sides know the importance of 
this game in every sport. 
2) Geor Gia: In one of my first classes at 
UF, my TA (whose other job was a priest, 
mind you) told us he generally saved the 
word “hate” for the devil, but he wanted everyone to hate anything and everything that came out of Athens, Ga. That’s a pretty 
strong statement, and it reflects the amount 
of hostility the UF-Georgia rivalry contains. Whether it’s at the event formerly known as the World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party in Jacksonville, at a gymnastics meet 
in the O’Connell Center or in a profanity-
laced conversation about jean shorts, this is a deeply rooted, intense rivalry. 
3) Tennessee: Having lived in the Volun-
teer State for nearly two years, I’ll admit I’m 
a little closer to this rivalry than most UF students. However, Lane Kiffin really took it to another level, without even coaching a game. With the controversial recruitment of 
Nu’Keese Richardson and public taunting of 
Urban Meyer, Kiffin has stoked the flames of this in-conference rivalry, and it’s show-ing across all sports. When Tennessee’s soft-
ball team came to Gainesville for a two-day 
series, Meyer was in the press box one day, and Tim Tebow was there the other day. Al-though Senior Day against FSU will be the most exciting experience in The Swamp this 
year, it’s hard to argue against Sept. 19 being 
the most anticipated day of the season.

During her junior year, Fran-
cesca Enea broke the UF career 
record for RBI, set the single-sea-
son RBI mark and shattered the 
school record for home runs in a career and a single season. And she basically did it all on only one 
good knee. 
Enea suffered a partially torn 
ACL for the second time in her 
three years at UF during the team’s preseason workouts in the fall. However, the doctor told her 
she could play without missing 
any time if she wore a brace, as she did during her freshman sea-son.
UF coach Tim Walton told 
the Alligator that Enea made her mind up and presented him with the options. 
“She said, ‘There’s no way that 
I’m not playing this season,’ and that was it,” Walton added.
Despite the injury, Enea start-
ed the season as one of the best 
offensive players in the country 
and had a record 71 RBI in 2009. 
In a Feb. 14 doubleheader — 
the seventh and eighth games 
of the season — the left fielder launched two grand slams and 
drove in 10 runs.
Part of a lineup so deep and 
effective that Walton once de-
scribed it as “murderer’s row,” 
Enea was consistently the biggest all-around threat. 
She finished the year with 
UF’s highest on-base percent-age (.494), the most home runs (18), the most RBI (71), tied for the highest slugging percentage (.713), the second most walks (48) 
and had the fifth-highest batting 
average (.339) on the team.
The UF soft-
ball team set record after re-
cord while go-
ing 133-10 over 
the last two years, and Enea shattered sev-
eral career mile-
stones in just three years. Her 41 
home runs and 157 RBI are both high marks for the program, and 
she still has another season to 
add to those numbers.
Her record-breaking 18 hom-
ers helped UF break its single-
season home run record in just 49 
games, 26 fewer than the Gators played in the entire season that they set the mark. One of Enea’s most memora-
ble longballs came on April 8 at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium against FSU. 
Two innings after Megan 
Bush’s homer sent the game to extra frames, Enea led off the ninth with a towering walk-off 
bomb to give the Gators the 4-3 
victory. 
“When I was running around 
the bases, I was like ‘I hope they dogpile me. I’ve never been in 
one,’” Enea said after the game. 
“Then I saw Kristina (Hilberth) bounding toward me, hands in the air ready to tackle me, and I was like, ‘Do it!’”
Enea picked up two South-
eastern Conference Player of the Week honors early in the season, and she was one of the top 25 fi-nalists for the 2009 USA Softball 
Collegiate Player of the Year.
For lighting up the scoreboard 
and rewriting the UF record 
books — all while dealing with a 
serious injury — Francesca Enea 
is the alligatorSports No. 7 UF Athlete of 2008-09.

Four years ago, Sha Brooks may 
have wanted to play basketball for Tennessee.
It is the inclination for many 
women’s basketball players since Pat Summitt has made Knoxville, Tenn., a hot spot for the game, win-
ning eight NCAA Championships 
and earning a berth in every NCAA Tournament since its inception.
But the 5-foot-7 guard from Jack-
son, Tenn., wasn’t wanted by the 
Volunteers, who play roughly five 
hours from where she grew up.
She became a Gator instead but 
always saved her best performances 
for when Rocky Top was blaring.
With ESPN coming to the O’ Con-
nell Center for a women’s basketball 
game for the first time in seven years, Brooks scored 29 points to lead the 
Gators in a 66-57 win against the 
Volunteers on Feb. 8. 
It was only UF’s third-ever win 
against Tennessee and resulted in  an 
AP Poll Top 10 ranking for the first 
time since February 2001.
And when the Gators trailed 50-43 
with 7:29 remaining, Brooks would come through with one of her finest 
moments.
She came down the court and 
drilled a 3-pointer from the top 
of the key.  Then she did it again.  
Next, she drew a charge on Tennes-see sharpshooter Angie Bjorkuland, 
sending the game to a media timeout and bringing the crowd to its feet as it erupted. 
Two more free throws from 
Brooks cut the deficit to 1 before yet another 3-pointer from the top of the key gave UF a lead it would not sur-
render.
For a nearly six-minute stretch, 
the senior guard scored 12 points 
and was her team’s entire offense.
It was the brightest in a season of 
many shining mo-ments for the four-year starter.
She pushed her 
teammates to one of the best seasons in program history, setting new school records with 15 
straight wins and seven consecutive Southeastern Conference victories. 
UF returned to the Big Dance af-
ter a two-year absence and won a 
first-round game against Temple 
before falling to eventual national champion Connecticut.
And she was certainly a part of 
the action every night, starting all 32 
games, and finished her career hav-
ing been on the floor for the opening tip 123 straight times. 
Brooks led the team in scoring, 
averaging 16.4 points per game, but upped that total to 18.8 per contest in eight matchups against nationally ranked opponents. The senior earned SEC Player of 
the Week honors on three separate occasions en route to being a unani-mous First Team All-SEC selection 
by the coaches and media. 
She will leave Gainesville as one 
of only two Gators (Brandi McCain, 
‘98-’02) with 1,500 points, 275 assists 
and 200 steals. 
Brooks was also selected in the 
WNBA Draft in April. 
The Phoenix Mercury selected her 
in the third round as the 31st overall selection. She became the 15th over-
all Gator to be drafted and the first since Dalila Eshe in 2006. 
Consider the record books rewrit-
ten as well. 
Brooks leaves UF as No. 1 in 
consecutive starts (123), made free throws (430) and free-throw attempts (550). She also ranks No. 2 in min-
utes played (3,882), No. 3 in steals 
(242), No. 3 in 3-pointers made and attempted (212/703), tied for No. 4 in games played (126) and No. 5 in 
points (1,820) and free-throw per-
centage (78.2 percent).
For her dependable scoring, clutch 
performances and leading the Gators to one of their best seasons ever, Sha 
Brooks is the alligatorSports No. 8 
UF Athlete of 2008-09.
