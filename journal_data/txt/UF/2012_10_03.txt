We Didn’t Start the Fire
Gainesville Fire Rescue workers use a ﬁ  retruck’s lift to look for signs of a ﬁ  re on top of Marston Science Library on Tuesday evening. They responded to reports of smoke in the Computer Sciences and Engineering building. Students were evacuated while GFR workers investigated and contained the smoke to the fourth ﬂ  oor. The cause of the smoke was a faulty air-handling unit.

About 5,860 people voted 
Tuesday in UF’s Student 
Government elections, which 
continue today.
That number is about 
11 percent less than Spring 
2012’s 6,517 ﬁ  rst-day voters. 
The total for the ﬁ  rst day of 
Fall 2011 elections was 5,486, according to Alligator ar-chives.
While voting, students are 
asked three times to verify their district. If it is wrong, they are asked to digitally sign an afﬁ  davit with their 
correct address.
Several students were in-
correctly registered for Dis-
trict E, which included zip codes not in the other four districts. Classiﬁ  cation errors 
also occurred in the Fall 2011 elections.
Students may have been 
placed in District E because 
their permanent home ad-dress is saved with the Ofﬁ  ce of the University Registrar, 
according to Alligator ar-
chives.
Maggie McGovern was 
registered in the wrong dis-trict Tuesday when she tried 
to vote at the Computer Sci-
ences and Engineering build-ing.
“I was registered for Dis-
trict E, but I know I’m in Dis-trict D,” the 20-year-old an-thropology junior said. She signed the afﬁ  davit with her new address.

istered for District E, the screen displays that the stu-dent doesn’t live in any of 
the other zip codes. But when First day of elections

Female students in science, technology, engineering and 
math ﬁ  elds experience gender bias when applying for jobs, 
according to a recent Yale University study.
But faculty and students are trying to prevent that bias 
from impacting UF’s campus.
Solutions lie in educating employers and teaching female 
students to promote their skills, said Teresa Balser, dean of 
UF’s College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.“I suspect it is just as big a problem at UF as at any other 
university,” she said. “Now that I know the study is out 
there, we can ensure there isn’t a bias against students.”
The study, which was published online Sept. 17 by the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, assigned fake male and female names to identical mock applications 
for a lab manager job, said Corinne Moss-Racusin, a post-
doctoral associate at Yale who worked on the study. Biol-
ogy, physics and chemistry professors were given the ap-plications.
The team found that male applicants were offered salaries of about $4,000 more per year, Moss-Racusin said. Most pro-
fessors said they would choose the male applicants before 
the female applicants to mentor or to bring to conventions.
Moss-Racusin wasn’t shocked that female professors Study finds gender bias is present in hiring for STEM jobs

The response from police and volunteers 
has been substantial in the search for a UF stu-
dent who disappeared Sept. 20.
The Gainesville Police Department de-ployed ofﬁ  cers on horses, aerial units and police dogs as well as ofﬁ  cers to assist in the search for Christian Aguilar.
Dozens of law enforcement agencies from 
throughout the state have donated resources, 
including ofﬁ  cers from Aguilar’s hometown, 
Doral, Fla., police dogs from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and investigators from the FBI.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said ofﬁ  cers 
from different areas, like the department’s Training Bureau, have been moved and tem-porarily reassigned to in-vestigate Aguilar’s disap-pearance. 
“That’s going to continue 
as long as we keep getting fresh leads,” Tobias said.
He said police searched 
about 25 locations around 
the city Monday.
“It’s very spotty ,” he 
said. “It’s almost like throwing a dart to a 
map.”These darts, however, are calculated, To-
bias added. The locations are determined by leads and from phone calls to the department.
Alongside police, volunteers traveled to 
Gainesville to help the Aguilar family ﬁ  nd its 
missing family member.
Tobias said about 300 people, including 
Gainesville and Miami residents, participated 
in the search effort Saturday.

UF Student Government’s 
Academic Affairs Cabinet will 
host the inaugural Steps to Suc-cess Tutoring Fair from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. today on the Reitz 
Union Colonnade.
Tutoring companies like 
Study Edge and Smokin’ Notes 
will offer promotional products and coupons for their services to people who stop by . Eight groups are scheduled to attend and aim to make students more aware of their options, said Em-
ily Hilton, SG director of aca-
demic affairs.
“Most students don’t realize 
there are free tutoring services, even on campus,” she said.Food science and human 
nutrition sophomore Abigail Gruspe, 18, had mainly heard of tutoring services that charge fees.
“I’m sure the way they con-
dense it is helpful,” Gruspe said. “But I really think that with Smokin’ Notes and those 
kinds of things, it’s more im-
portant that you go to class and take notes.”
The fair will provide free 
snacks and drinks. The ﬁ  rst 150 students to check in at the SG 
table with their Gator1 cards 
will receive  free T-shirts.
Michael Mas, an 18-year-old 
mechanical and aerospace en-gineering freshman, said he is interested in visiting the event. But he wasn’t sure how to bal-ance his time between the tutor-ing fair and Career Showcase.
“I think it’s a wonderful op-
portunity for everyone to ﬁ  nd out what’s out there and to in-crease the overall academic suc-cess at our school,” Hilton said.
Family, youth and com-
munity sciences junior Theresa Faleti, 20, said the fair could be helpful, depending on what 
classes UF students are taking.
“If I needed it, I would deﬁ  -
nitely go,” Faleti said.Fair offers tutoring resources
� SURF FRENZY IS SOLD OUT.

SigEp Surf Frenzy is an annual 
event, but tonight it’ll be at a new lo-
cation.
The Florida Alpha chapter of Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon decided to move its 
philanthropic event from the Florida 
Theatre to the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts this year to cater to audience members, said John-Paul Suastegui, the event director. He said the fraternity had to turn people away last year because the building reached capacity.
The Phillips Center can seat more people, said Carlos Gordian, president of Sigma Phi Epsilon. It will cost the fraternity about $5,000 more to host the event in the new location, the 21-year-old material science and engineering junior said.
This year’s Surf Frenzy is sold out, 
with 1,680 tickets sold, Suastegui said. 
Tickets will not be sold at the door.
“It’s a very competitive event that 
people care about,” Suastegui said. 
“They know at the end of the day it’s going to a good cause.”
The fraternity’s goal is to match 
the $24,974 it raised last year, said Suastegui. The money will beneﬁ  t the Florida Diabetes Camp, a year-round 
camp that provides recreational activi-
ties and diabetes education to diabetic children.SigEp moves charity event

the zip codes did not appear.  
When Vatsal Vora voted at the CSE 
building, he didn’t know which district he should have been registered in.
“I’m not 100 percent sure, but it seems 
like it was correct,” said the 18-year-old 
computer engineering sophomore.
Supervisor of Elections Stephen Davis 
did not return phone calls regarding the 
districts.
Students Party President Ford Dwyer 
was placed in District B even though he’s running for District D, where he lives.
“We are disappointed but still deciding 
what will happen about that,” Dwyer said.
Despite potential district issues, he said 
the first day of elections ran smoothly.
Swamp Party spokesman Daniel 
Landesberg echoed that sentiment.
“I think they went well, but I guess we’ll 
see [tonight],” he said.
Landesberg said he doesn’t think the 
issue regarding districts will cause prob-lems. He said the multiple chances given to 
students to change their districts worked 
well.The Election Commission also heard 
two complaints, filed by the Swamp Party, 
Tuesday. The commission voted the Stu-
dents Party must remove by 10 a.m. today fliers that were left at Stoneridge Apart-ments. The other complaint, which was 
about the Students Party tweeting during a 
summer Student Senate meeting, was dis-missed because the commission could not find a violation.
The commission will hear other elec-
tions violation complaints Thursday. As of press time, it had received four complaints, said Election Commission chairman Wes 
Stephens.
The Supreme Court also heard an ap-
peal regarding the Election Commission’s 
decision that the Swamp Party cannot be referred to as “the former Unite Party,” or 
any variation thereof, in campaign mate-
rials. The court lifted the cease and desist order.

a search that has taken this kind of 
magnitude,” he said.
Due to the limited number of offi-
cers available to manage search teams during the weekend, Gainesville Po-
lice limited the number of volunteers 
who could participate, Tobias said.
Since then, volunteer participa-
tion dropped. Tobias said about 20 volunteers helped police with the search Monday and Tuesday.
“We still have volunteers com-
ing out, wanting to give this family some closure,” he said. “I’ve never seen a response like that.”
V olunteers interested in helping 
with the search can sign up at the Florida Farm Bureau, 5600 SW 34th St. The search will start today at 9 a.m. 
This time, anyone will be able to 
help, and there will be no limit to how many people can participate.
“If you show up, we will find 
something for you to do,” he wrote on the GPD’s Facebook page.
Miriam Pardo, an Aguilar family 
spokeswoman, said volunteers will 
be provided with food, water, sup-
plies and tips from officers.
“They’ll get trained for what they 
are trying to look out for,” she said.  
University Police vans will then 
take volunteers from the check-in to the search locations from the Florida Farm Bureau.
Because the search for Aguilar 
is now a search and recovery effort, Tobias cautioned potential volun-
teers that they need to understand 
what they’re looking for.
“At this point, you’re searching 
not for a live person; you’re search-ing for the victim of a murder,” he said. “We don’t want kids out there. We want people to be fully aware that more than likely what they’re going to discover, if it’s a civilian 
that discovers it, is going to be dis-
turbing.”

� ABOUT 44 PERCENT OF U.S. ADULTS HAVE 
SMARTPHONES. 
NOELIA TRUJILLO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ten UF students sat scattered on an RTS bus Tuesday. While 
each had his or her differences in appearance, they had one 
thing in common: They were looking at their smartphones.
Criminology and law sophomore Edwin Velazquez, 19, was 
one of the UF students heading home from class glancing at his 
Sprint HTC EVO smartphone with headphones in his ears.  
V elazquez is one of the about 50 percent of U.S. adults who 
have mobile access to the Internet through a smartphone or 
tablet, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Ex-cellence in Journalism survey released Monday.
“I like listening to music when I use my phone on the bus,” 
he said. “And I’m definitely reading up on the election debate and the topics that will most likely be presented at the de-bate.”
The survey found that tablet and smartphone ownership 
has increased among adults. About 22 percent of U.S. adults now own a tablet, and 44 percent of U.S. adults own a smart-phone.
“The simple fact that technology is booming forces most 
Americans to catch up with new trends,” Velazquez said.
Other students said they feel the same way.“I always see people on their smartphones,” said Sheila 
Scolaro, a 20-year-old plant science junior. “They’re mostly on Facebook, texting or checking their emails.”
After owning an iPhone 4 for a year and an iPad for two years, Scolaro said she can’t imagine life without them.
She said she likes to check her email on her phone and to see 
her planner electronically . However, she prefers to look at the news on her laptop.
While the Pew survey said that almost two-thirds of the 
smartphone and tablet owners use their devices to read the news, it also found that 41 percent of mobile users prefer to view the news from their computers.
UF health science major Juliet Eirikis, 19, doesn’t own a 
smartphone or a tablet.
She said she won’t pay for the unnecessary data plans that 
come with smartphones.
“Last time I purchased a phone, I noticed how few choices 
there were for nonsmartphones,” she said. “I think that’s what the consumer wants, and that’s what the industry is pushing toward.”Survey shows half of US adults have mobile Internet access
Four complaints were filed with the Election Commission on Tuesday
ElEctionS , from page 1
SEArch , from page 1The search starts at 9 a.m. Bias is unconscious, professors say
were just as likely to be gender-
biased, but the bias was stron-
ger than she expected.
“It shows how pervasive 
these biases are in our culture about women not being as 
good of scientists and those 
kinds of messages,” she said. 
“There was no difference be-
tween young or old professors or those in fields with less gen-
der parity. Their bias seems to 
be evenly distributed.”
Jean Larson, a professor in 
UF’s mathematics department, 
said she was not surprised by 
the study’s findings. She said 
she had seen previous studies 
come to similar conclusions.
“Almost all of the people in 
the mathematics department are male,” Larson said. “It’s 
been that way for a long time, 
but it’s a lot better now than 
when I started in 1974.”
Larson said she was the first 
woman to get a doctorate in mathematics at her graduate 
school, Dartmouth College, but 
she has not felt discriminated 
against.
Kent Crippen, associate 
professor of STEM education 
in UF’s College of Education, said the study implies the bias 
is deeply rooted and requires a 
new approach to correct it.
“If it’s unconscious bias, it 
tells us we need a whole dif-
ferent approach,” he said. “It’s 
much more subtle than we 
think it would be. They don’t 
say ‘No, you can’t,’ or ‘You’re 
not capable,’ but they send messages very clearly.”
Crippen said he has heard 
students and colleagues at UF 
talk about the issue, but that it 
“isn’t necessarily connected to 
one place.”The study raises concerns 
about the field Alina Ciornii, a 21-year-old chemical engineer -
ing senior, wants to go into. But 
she said she hasn’t seen effects of gender bias at UF.
As president of the Society 
of Women Engineers, Ciornii’s college experience has focused 
on spreading the word about 
opportunities for women in STEM fields. She said opportu-
nities like the Career Showcase 
have helped her get interviews, 
and the club has acted as a sup-
port system, “saying, ‘It’s OK to 
be a woman in engineering.’”
Ciornii said she thinks that 
as more young women gradu-
ate with STEM degrees, the bias 
will diminish.
“I think a lot has to do with 
older generations who maybe haven’t gotten used to changes 
in the last 40 years,” she said. 
“Bias may exist, but I think the 
biggest thing is not to be pes-
simistic but not be complacent, 
either.”StEm , from page 1

Students who want to vote in 
Alachua County have less than a 
week left to register.
The deadline is Tuesday for gen-
eral election voter registration.
Students can grab a form on 
campus from various voting orga-nizations on Turlington Plaza and at the Reitz Union. Forms are also available at public libraries and the Supervisor of Elections office. Ala-chua County Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter said all forms must be postmarked by Tuesday.
There will be federal, state, coun-
ty and municipal candidates on the Nov. 6 ballot.
Carpenter said Florida law re-
quires voters to be registered for at least 29 days before voting in an election.
She said anyone who is eligible 
to vote can register by visiting the Alachua County Supervisor of Elec-tions website and printing a voter registration form.
“The future is in their hands,” 
she said. “They’re the ones who are going to be living whatever future is created.”
Billy Farrell, president of UF Col-
lege Democrats, said the club wants all students to be able to vote.
“Our goal is to register every 
student, regardless of political affili-
ation,” the 20-year-old environmen-
tal science junior said.
He said UF College Democrats 
will be outside the Reitz Union and Turlington Hall with voter registra-
tion forms every day this week.     
“There’s no excuse not to regis-
ter,” Farrell said.
Katy Melchiorre, 21-year-old po-
litical science and telecommunica-tion senior and chairwoman of UF College Republicans, said students 
should realize their votes matter.
“It really can make a difference, 
especially in a state like Florida,” she said.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The UF Counseling and Wellness Center 
is now using traditional Chinese medicine to 
reduce students’ anxiety and stress.
The center hosts a group called Moving 
the Anxious Mind, which implements qigong 
exercises, that meets Tuesdays at the center 
from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.
“Stress is a perceived threat,” said Barbara Welsch, a licensed psychologist and group instructor. “Stress is the brain overriding the 
body’s desire to choke the hell out of some-
one or something that deserves it.”
Interested students should to call the cen-
ter to sign up for the group or contact Wel-sch.
Instructors will teach students how to tar -
get areas of pain where stress has settled in, using a small ball and slow fluid-like move-ments.
“If you don’t try and just go through the 
movements, it won’t work.” she said. “You have to try. Most importantly, smile from your heart, and then you will do qigong.”
It is a lifelong practice that will help man-
age stress and prevent its effects, with just 15 minutes a day, Welsch said.
Stark Jones, a first-year Ph.D. molecular 
biology student and power yoga instructor, said all bodies have electrical impulses that affect the health of muscles, organs and cog-nitive abilities.
Sometimes the flow of energy can become blocked, fatigued or inactive, causing insom-nia, mood changes, pain and immune system problems, he said.
These slow fluid-like movements allow 
the body to guide qi, or energy, to tense mus-cles and parts of the body, Jones said.
Qigong will help bring your mind back to 
what you were doing — the here and now, he said.
“Qigong has shown to be very beneficial,” 
Jones said. “By reducing the amount of stress and anxiety in their lives, qigong helps stu-dents with sleep, concentration, focus, cogni-tive behavior and the immune system.” UF to offer Chinese medicine to reduce students’ stresses

Smile — you’re on RTS cam-
era.
Beginning this semester, UF 
students who get on Regional 
Transit System buses will be on 
camera during the rides.
As of the end of the summer, 
all RTS buses have cameras on 
the inside and outside of the ve-hicles. Some new buses already had the cameras installed, and the older buses had the cameras installed during the summer, RTS spokesman Chip Skinner 
wrote in an email.
These cameras are constantly 
running and can be used in the 
case of on-board incidences and crashes, he said. The total cost of the project was $235,000.
“No particular incident 
caused the installation of the cameras,” Skinner said. “Cam-
eras inside and outside the 
buses have become an industry standard in the last five years or so.”
There are five cameras on 
each bus, he said. Three are inside the bus: one each in the front, in the back and watching outside the windshield. Two outside cameras face the front of the bus.
He said that most bus drivers 
are happy to have the cameras on board, and the video surveil-
lance has already saved the city 
from paying out some accident liability claims by showing the RTS driver was not at fault.
“There are a very few that 
still do not like the cameras, as they feel it is an invasion of their privacy ,” Skinner said.  “However, we tend to find 
those operators are usually do-
ing something against our poli-cies and procedures.”
For the most part, students 
see the installation of the cam-eras as a positive thing. Dan-ielle Capitini, 19-year-old UF criminology and law sopho-more, said she knew about the 
addition of cameras and didn’t 
feel they were an invasion of privacy.
“I think it’s just there to pro-
tect the students,” she said. “A bus isn’t really a private place anyways.”
Luigi Forvil, a 23-year-old 
UF philosophy junior, said he 
thought the cameras could be 
an invasion of privacy.
However, he felt the cameras 
are more helpful than harmful.
“It’s a good thing because 
if there’s a robbery , police can track it down easier,” Forvil said.Security cameras

hands.”

Vote “NO” on the 
racks referendum
Well, we don’t know how to explain the racks referen-
dum that is on the ballot to you.
We had to explain it multiple times during the sum-
mer, and now a lot of our efforts are sort of being undermined.
And by who? By fellow Gainesville publications.
The Odyssey is about to publish its latest edition, and in it is 
a condemnation of the racks referendum.
Their ﬂ  iers are threatening; they say if you support UF, then 
you should vote “yes” on the racks referendum.
We all support UF, but we also support the access to free 
speech.
A Facebook event designed by The Odyssey to rally support 
claims that the new black modular distribution “units have al-
lowed our publication to expand its distribution on campus in a 
fair and sustainable manor.”
First of all, we think you meant “manner.” 
Second, it’s not just about you.The newest edition of The Odyssey , which will be released 
Thursday , the day after Student Government elections come to a close, states: “While we appreciate that the independently owned orange racks have been a tradition on our campus, we must disagree with the Alligator’s First Amendment argument since the color of the distribution rack does not affect the access 
to the content of it or any publication.”
This isn’t an issue of color, guys.
Let’s get something straight here: It does not matter what 
color the racks are. What matters is the access.
If people have limited access to an independently owned 
newspaper, then that’s not terribly American.
We understand that UF has the right to decide what is on its 
campus. We don’t need an SG that works with the administra-tion to remove available free press. Not to mention, it will not 
always be free to rent space in the new racks.
We’re not loaded-out-the-butt with money like some publica-
tions.
The paid members of the Alligator staff receive at most mini-
mum wage, if not less than that. It takes a lot of work to put out a 
daily, free publication — as opposed to a weekly one.
V oting on the racks referendum will not accomplish much 
one way or another. It is simply a way to gain opinions from the voters that will translate into the Senate. The problem comes 
down to who makes up a majority of the Senate.
Let’s say, hypothetically, that a large percentage of voters 
vote “no” on the racks referendum. If the Swamp Party holds 
a majority of the seats, then they will most likely ignore that large number of students who oppose the removal of the orange racks. If the Students Party holds a majority of the seats, then they will ﬁ  ght for what the Student Body wants.
That’s why it’s important to vote. That’s why this racks refer-
endum is about more than what color the racks are.
This is about your free speech as a student, and how certain 
SG parties may not defend that right like they should.
Your vote matters. It matters to us, and it matters to the Stu-
dents Party.Christianity is a crazy religion at times
There isn’t a politically correct way to say this, so I’ll 
just say it: Christians are crazy people.
It’s a generalization, and technically I’m one of 
them.  
I’ve seen some extreme stupidity perpetuated by “Chris-
tians,” so I hesitate to identify myself as such. Still, I have to call a spade a spade: I’m a Christian, and we’re crazy.
I think I’m okay with that, though. Faith simply doesn’t 
sit well in the belly of Western rationality . An invisible deity is a strange cog to place in modern intellectual machinery.
Everybody has beef with God, and many have good rea-
son. Honestly , I’d be concerned if a rational person didn’t 
have some serious questions after taking a look around our 
world.
I’m sure you have your doubts.  Well, join the club.There’s so much that doesn’t make sense to me. Suffer-
ing? I could do without it. Disease? I’m over it. And don’t even get me started on the existence of mosquitoes. Really , 
God?
I’m being facetious, but I’ve got deeper questions that I 
want answered, and the God of the Bible seemed to come up 
short when I started asking.   
Somewhere along the road, I bought the idea that faith 
meant brainwashing myself into baseless adherence to a code. This was tantamount to intellectual dishonesty for someone who felt compelled to have all the answers from the God that he couldn’t see.  
People weren’t much help.  
One person judged me for having doubts, and another 
advised that I throw the pursuit away entirely .  
Eventually , I stopped asking around and resolved to go 
straight to the source. I started by hitting up the Bible, and 
supplemented my research with earnest questions aimed di-rectly at the big man.  
It was a crazy idea, especially because I had doubts about 
the Bible (the most popular game of “telephone” the world 
has ever seen — or so I was told).  I was surprised when further 
research revealed the Bible was 
the most thoroughly documented book in all antiquity . If I threw 
that out, I’d have to throw out 
every other ancient text to be con-sistent.  
It turns out that God is pretty 
secure.  
He wasn’t threatened by my doubt.  In fact, he welcomed my incessant questioning, because 
he designed me that way . As I ruminated on the nature of 
my budding spiritual relationship and compared it to other 
relationships I’d seen, I was struck by a strange realization.  
If two married humans can directly interact and barely 
understand each other while enjoying the journey, why did I think that I had to have all the answers about a God that I couldn’t see? A lover’s faith is based on his or her experi-ence. What he or she has seen pushes that person to ﬁ  ght 
through the relational darkness of another shady human.
I realize that this sounds crazy, but I radically encoun-
tered God in a way that was relational. The doubts don’t 
quite nag the way they used to.    
I’m not saying that everything makes sense to me.  Take the conundrum of the Trinity, for instance.God is one, but three? Foolishness!  It registers as a rational impossibility, although some 
probing of physics and wave-particle duality has recently tweaked my deﬁ  nition of the word impossible.
To paraphrase Billy Graham, I might not see the wind, 
but I can see its effects.  The invisible God is more than just my homeboy , and my soul is forever changed.  
We don’t quite match, but we coordinate.  Despite my doubts, I’ve found it difﬁ  cult to walk away 
from the journey that I’m on.
Doing so would be crazy.  Ryan Galloway is a religion senior at UF. His column appears

Seeking recovery from the embarrassment of using 
“replacement referees” for nearly a quarter of a 16-
game season, the National Football League hopes to 
wipe the slate clean and move forward from the debacle 
that frustrated the hearts and souls of football fans and players alike.  
The outrage that ensued from the referee scandal sig-
naled that the NFL, arguably the most popular profes-sional sporting league in the nation, has been negatively 
impacted by complicated labor negotiations. The use of 
replacements arguably diluted the quality of play and re-moved the sports focus from the players to the failure of 
the referees, highlighting a process that would serve as a 
detriment to the NFL.  
Having nearly succumbed to a complete work stop-
page in the previous year, the NFL could not afford to continue being viewed in such a negative light in the short term.  Future losses that would  result from potentially 
declining viewership would decrease revenue, albeit on 
a limited scale.  
Although the league seemed to be negotiating in good 
faith, it may appear that the losses that resulted from bet-
ting were the straw that broke the camel’s back with respect 
to putting regular referees back 
on the ﬁ  eld.
Following the madness that 
ensued from the monstrosity of a result in Seattle, about $300 million in bets changed hands, 
according to Vegas oddsmak-
ers. 
This loss would have resulted in additional lost mon-
ey as bettors claimed that up to 20 percent of wages that would have been bet over the course of the season would have been withheld.  Due to the unpredictability that re-
sulted from the referees, a large number of bettors would 
have avoided betting money on football.  
Effectively, demand for the NFL would have decreased 
due to the mistrust and lack of consumer conﬁ  dence that was caused by the presence and focus on the replacement 
referees.
While the NFL was already well on the way to ﬁ  nal-
izing a long-term labor agreement with the referees, the decrease in demand on the part of bettors would eventu-
ally reduce interest in the league.
This served as a prime incentive for reaching a swift 
agreement that put the regular referees on the gridiron this weekend.
There is no doubt that the league was impacted nega-
tively by replacement referees. According to a study, 50 percent of fans said they would watch less football and 74 percent claimed the lockout had a negative effect on their 
opinion of the NFL.  
There was no avoiding a major controversy that would 
damage the reputation of the league.
While not explicitly stating it, NFL commissioner Rog-
er Goodell seemed to agree with this point.
He said in respect to the referee crisis, “This has gotten 
a lot of attention. It hasn’t been positive. We had to work 
through it to get to an eight-year agreement.”
Regardless of the impact of betting in accelerating 
negotiations, the referee crisis was bound to be resolved eventually . 
The Monday Night mistake that cost bettors millions 
essentially forced the NFL’s hand and necessitated an im-mediate agreement. As such, gambling in fact may have corrected an issue, unlike in other sporting leagues in 
which it has created major long-term problems.  
Clearly , the NFL was pressured into developing a 
resolution so that the public’s focus would shift from the replacement referees back toward the players so that the 
league could return to labor peace.

opinions@alligator.orgWhichever candidate takes ofﬁ  ce in January will 
have plenty of people to thank, most notably the Americans who voted him into ofﬁ  ce. But more 
than a third of us won’t have participated.
Less than 60 percent of registered voters have shown up 
to cast ballots in recent presidential elections, and attendance 
at midterm and local elections ranges from ﬁ  ve to 40 percent 
— certainly not encouraging ﬁ  gures for those who value democratic participation.
Civil-minded types will point to dismal returns from the 
ballot box as a failure to perform basic civic duties. This is especially true at crucial local and state elections in which a single vote carries much more weight than one vote in large national elections.
But registered voters staying home may be a sign of an 
improving, established democracy rather than a failing one.
On Nov . 6, millions of Americans will perform their 
“duty” and walk out of a polling place proudly displaying an “I Voted” sticker, proving to their communities that they care about their country. The “Get Out the Vote” and voter registration drives sprout up across the country in election years to preach that regardless of who you cast a ballot for, showing up to the polls is positive.
It’s not negative to feel good about participating in gov-
ernment or inﬂ  uencing others to do so, but isn’t it strange that a major motivation for voting is personal pride?
More important, we should question whether pushing 
citizens to the polls is truly beneﬁ  cial to our democracy.
Every vote cast should be made by an educated and in-
formed citizen who has a stake in the effect of his selection. The most inconsistent voters, those who show up to one elec-tion but not another, are also the voters most likely to be less educated.
There are two reasons why low 
voter turnout can actually beneﬁ  t government and representation.
First, those who aren’t motivated 
to show up to the polls are unlikely 
to be educated on or have an opinion about the issues and candidates on the ballot. 
Second, voting on every issue as a matter of civic duty 
means that voters will inevitably select between options on policy or platforms that don’t affect their lives, diluting the weight of every vote cast by an affected citizen.
In some cases, this is OK; an educated voter can choose 
an option likely to beneﬁ  t the whole of society . However, in most instances, an unaffected voter will ﬁ  nd it difﬁ  cult to understand the reach of his or her vote and how he or she is changing other citizen’s lives.
Voting is a citizen’s right, not duty. People who choose 
to vote, however, should understand the civic duty of being an informed voter. There are no points for bubbling in ballot choices without researching their meanings.
Show up to the polls this November. Being involved can, 
and should, be absolutely positive. Show up prepared and for the right reasons, and you will be part of the most impor-tant part of our democratic system.
But, afterward, understand that the “I Voted” sticker on 
your chest doesn’t tell the whole story . Maybe that sticker should include a modiﬁ  er in the form of an asterisk:

Maybe, despite killing Osama bin Laden, the Obama 
team is actually a bunch of “soft” warriors who want the United States to be liked, especially in the 
Middle East.
I, for one, called it right after the attack took place on the 
U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, Sept. 11, which left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. 
The Republicans are now launching a concerted attack on 
the Obama administration, claiming a cover-up and calling it “Libya-gate.” Are the Republicans right? Was it a massive intelligence failure not to know who’s who in Libya? Was it sloppy security to have a virtually unprotected consulate in Benghazi? Was it an act of extreme political correctness for the United States to virtually apologize for the anti-Muham-mad video that was thought to have triggered the demonstrations in Cairo and other parts of the Islamic world? Could this be an “October Surprise,” — one of those last-min-
ute events that have so often shifted 
the outcome of a presidential election?
Why, so many weeks later, is the FBI team still in the capi-
tal of Libya, 400 miles away from where the attack occurred? 
It’s all very disturbing.
Of course, the intelligence agencies also missed the horde 
of killers who attacked us Sept. 11, 2001.

�THE GRANT WILL BE USED 
TO TREAT DRINKING WATER.
BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Contributing Writer
The U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency announced UF will be 
among a group of universities to re-ceive a $1.5 million research grant to look into ways to treat drinking 
water.
The EPA gave UF and USF’s 
team $499,360 for the four-year 
project. The EPA Science to Achieve Results program funds the grant.
Treavor H. Boyer, UF and USF 
principal investigator, said the grants are funding new, innovative ideas. He said the program is start-
ing by figuring out how to treat wa-
ter from U.S. cities and could even-tually be used in more rural parts of the world.
“We are trying to remove mul-
tiple contaminants from water at the same time,” he said. “A lot of processes just focus on removing a single contaminate from water.”
UF plans to give some of the 
grant money to USF, so its research-ers can be involved in the project, 
he said.
Boyer said he decided to in-
volve USF in the research, because 
he respects its life-cycle analysis 
program and the work being done 
there. He said the research made at UF will be more expensive, because it will be completed in a laboratory, while USF research will be done on computers.
The money from the grant will 
sponsor one Ph.D. student at each university to continue the research.
Boyer said the research will fo-
cus on ions and the range of poten-tial environmental impacts.
Boyer said one method to treat 
water is to draw contaminants out by using methods similar to a mag-net. An opposing charge attracts the contaminants, he said.
The $1.5 million grant, which 
was announced early this semester, is a supplement to a previous grant, which included eight colleges. UF, USF, University of Nevada and Clarkson University are recipients of the new grant.
The project’s pilot program will 
test the water at Cedar Key, he said.
“I’m really excited by the EPA 
making it a priority to help small water systems,” he said.UF receives

The “freshman 15” doesn’t stop 
at the end of freshman year, accord-
ing to a new study.
A survey of 131 college stu-
dents found that 70 percent of them 
gained an average of 10 pounds 
and 18 percent gained 20 pounds or more during four years in college.
The study was published online 
Sept. 17 by the NRC Research Press journal, Applied Physiology, Nutri-tion and Metabolism.
Jane Emmerée, GatorWell 
health promotion specialist, said 
most studies that looked into the 
validity of the freshman 15 found that few freshman actually gained 15 pounds.
Catherine Seemann, advertis-
ing, marketing and media coordi-nator for the Student Health Care Center, said there is truth in the well-known myth.
“The freshman 15 is a legend 
but is based on a little bit of facts,” Seemann said. “Some people gain more or less, and some don’t even gain at all.”
However, she said she doubts 
this study’s results, because too few people were surveyed. She said the results are not necessarily represen-tative of all college students.
She said UF’s students have a 
variety of eating and fitness habits.
Some freshmen have said 
they’ve lost weight since they be-gan college.
Heather Joura, a 17-year-old UF 
freshman, said she doesn’t have time to eat and has lost weight.
“I pick up whatever is at my 
dorm and eat it,” she said. “I prob-ably haven’t eaten a whole meal 
since I started school.”
Biochemistry junior Jamal 
Green, 19, said he gained about 20 
pounds in mostly muscle weight during his freshman year.
“I definitely gained weight but 
from going to the gym,” Green said.
Marketing junior TanTaneya 
Williams, 19, said she started to gain weight once she got an all-ac-cess meal plan during her freshman year.
“Go to the gym,” she said. “It’ll 
induce that habit of going to the gym even after graduating.”
Emmerée said sleep habits and 
stress management also cause 
weight changes.
“When we’re tired, we don’t 
make the wisest decisions,” she 
said.
Seemann said it’s also important 
to monitor what food you eat.
“It’s never a bad thing to splurge, 
but don’t make value meal No. 3 your lunch every day,” she said.Weight gain continues

When the Nov. 6 elections roll around, Ala-
chua County voters will have a say in whether 
local sales taxes should increase.
The Alachua County Commission put a ref-
erendum on the ballot about whether to add a sales tax that would raise $550 million to re-pave roads.
The surtax will add a .75 percent sales tax to 
most items already affected by the tax.
During a series of meetings to discuss tran-
sit improvements, the city and county commis-sions decided at the beginning of the year that 
an additional sales tax could improve Alachua 
County’s transit system.
“The city and the county agree on the fact 
there’s a problem with the transit system,” said 
City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins.
The city plans to use the money for road 
projects to loosen congestion. 
The county plans to use the money for road 
repair, said Tricia Kyzar, county public works administrative assistant.
Hawkins said he’s bothered that the county 
insists the surtax be used on road repairs in-
stead of transit projects.
“We’ve got to have transit,” he said. “There’s 
a problem with transportation in the communi-ty, but taking better care of the roads isn’t going to solve the congestion.”
Alachua County has 666 miles of paved 
roads, said County Commissioner Lee Pinko-son. He said the county has about $380 million in unfinished infrastructure projects.
The county estimates the new tax could 
bring in $22.5 million every year, which, over the course of its suggested 15-year life, would total about $340 million.
He said the money from the current gas tax 
isn’t enough to address that need, which is why the extra sales tax is necessary to complete the project.
Originally, most of Gainesville’s road and 
transit problems were fixed by funds received from a fuel tax. 
But the County Commission suggested the 
tax isn’t as effective as the county would like because hybrid vehicles are using less fuel, 
some people are driving less to save money, 
and the tax isn’t being adjust-
ed for inflation.
The county stated fuel 
taxes have dropped by about $600,000 since 2008.
The city and county went 
through a few variations about how money from the surtax 
should be split.
The city of Gainesville and Alachua County 
were supposed to evenly share about 86 per -
cent of the money from the surtax. The remain-ing 14 percent was to be divided between the 
remaining cities.
But the County Commission changed its 
mind on May 22.
Pinkoson said the new plan is to give 43 per -
cent of the funds to the county, 16 percent to 
outlying municipalities and the rest to the city of 
Gainesville.
Pinkoson said fixing roads is the county’s 
main priority with this proposed surtax. 
“All the people have to do is drive around, 
and they’ll see the roads need some help,” he 
said.

  Chaz Green could play in a game for 
the ﬁ  rst time in three weeks on Satur-
day.
Coaches expect   the junior right tack-
le, who suffered a right ankle sprain against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, to see the 
ﬁ  eld when No. 10 Florida hosts No. 4 
LSU this weekend.
  “Chaz should be available,” offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease said. “If he 
can go, obviously he’s a good player and 
gives depth at the spot because he’s had 
a lot of game experience, so that would 
be a big plus for us.”
  Junior Kyle Koehne started the past 
two games at right tackle. 
  After surrendering eight sacks against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, Florida allowed only three combined sacks 
against Tennessee and Kentucky. 
  UF averaged 6.1 yards per carry the 
past two weeks after gaining 4 yards per 
attempt during the ﬁ  rst two weeks.
  “Kyle Koehne 
has been doing a great job,” center Jonotthan Har-
rison said.  “Chaz coming back is just going to help get a tackle rotation going and stay fresh the whole game.”

coordinator Brent Pease never got away from football. His father, a former high school coach, taught him the game.Tackle likely to play vs. LSU  JURNY DUTY
  Jeff Driskel has been a revelation for the 
Gators.
  He has made more big plays in the 
passing game this season than most expect-ed he would.
  With each game, he has shown an ability 
to evade pass rushers and a willingness to attempt more throws down the ﬁ  eld than he did in 2011. 
Driskel has also ﬂ  ashed his scrambling 
skills on numerous occasions.
  But he shouldn’t be asked to do any of 
those things on Saturday.
  Florida will be facing one of the toughest 
pass defenses in the Southeastern Confer-
ence, and the UF coaches should place the 
onus on the running game.
  Led by Barkevious Mingo, Sam Mont-
gomery and Anthony Johnson, the Tigers’ defensive line is too disruptive for opposing 
offenses to throw downﬁ  eld effectively.  “They’ve got speed 
on the edges and power in the middle,” 
offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “You can’t just sit back 
there at seven yards 
and expect to pass the 
ball every play.”
  The numbers support Pease’s observa-
tions. 
The Tigers rank sixth in the nation in 
passing yards allowed per game with 134.8. Regardless of the fact that LSU has yet to play a ranked opponent, that’s an impres-
sive total. 
 They have also allowed just 4.6 yards per 
pass attempt, good for third in the country.
 The highest-rated pass defense Florida 
has faced to this point is Kentucky, which UF must establish run to win    JOE MORGAN

  Coordinator Brent Pease called the 
offensive line the Gators’ strongest 
unit. It’s time for the big men to ﬂ  ex 
their muscles. 
LSU’s defense may boast the best 
front four that Florida will face in 
2012.
  UF’s front ﬁ  ve are the primary 
protection separating quarterback Jeff Driskel from multiple trips to the ground in The Swamp on Saturday.
  “We know about their speed rush-
ers,” Driskel said. “They’re going to get in there quick. ... Our line is ready for the challenge.”
  “[LSU’s defensive linemen are] the 
guys that take out so much of the cov-erage situation because they get to you so fast,” Pease said. 
“It’s not that maybe they’re sacking 
you all the time, but it’s just moving 
you around in the pocket. When you 
start having to move, your eyes become different as a quarterback on where you’re trying to focus and throwing on 
time and rhythm. It’s disruptive.”
  The Tigers’ defensive line includes 
ends Barkevious Mingo, Sam Mont-
gomery, Lavar Edwards and Jermauria Rasco. 
Bennie Logan, Anthony Johnson, 
Josh Downs and Ego Ferguson rotate at tackle.  Mingo and Montgomery each 
earned ﬁ  rst-team spots on the All-Southeastern Conference preseason 
squad. Logan was a third-team selec-
tion.
  LSU’s eight defensive linemen have 
impressed in 2012, contributing to the 
nation’s No. 4 total defense. 
The big men have combined for 23.5 
tackles for loss, seven sacks, 16 quar-
terback hurries and a safety in ﬁ  ve games.
  Despite the Tigers’ impressive 
numbers this season, center Jonotthan Harrison feels his unit can slow them down.
  “We’re going against some better 
athletes, but we, especially as an offen-sive line, we’ve come a far ways from 
last year,” Harrison said. “We’re more 
meshed as a unit. We’ve been working this whole offseason for a situation like this.”Gators offensive line to be

TUESDAY’S FINAL ROUND.
CHARLES KINGSBURY
Alligator Writer
Last season at the Olympia 
Fields Invitational, senior T.J. 
Vogel got off to a hot start before 
catching fire in the latter part of 
the tournament. 
On Tuesday, Vogel built upon 
Monday’s late surge, powering 
the Gators to a second-place fin-
ish at the same invite in Olympia Fields, Ill.  
Florida posted a final-round 
score of 286 (+6) to leapfrog Flor -
ida State and Duke en route to a second-place finish at the par-70, 7,080-yard course. 
Florida carded an 867 (+27) 
for the tournament, finishing 13 strokes behind first-place Arkan-sas (854). 
“I said earlier that I believed 
we had a good day left in us, and 
we did,” coach Buddy Alexander 
said. 
Vogel was efficient early, us-
ing his putting to amass seven birdies through 14 holes. After consecutive birdies on holes 13 and 14, Vogel bogeyed three of 
the last four holes to card a 68 (-2) 
on the final day of play. 
The round matched his best 
showing in three trips to the Olympia Fields Invite. 
He shot a 214 (+4) for the tour -
nament, tied for seventh place overall. The performance marked 
his second straight top-10 finish.
After unfavorable weather led 
to a 295 (+15) on Sunday, Flori-
da strung together consecutive 
rounds of 286 (+6). Sophomore Santiago Gavino carded a 71 
(+1) while freshman A.J. Crouch 
turned in a 72 (+2). 
Gavino posted a 71 (+1), the 
lowest 18-hole score he’s record-
ed at Florida. 
He totaled a 228 (+18) for the 
tournament. 
Senior Tyler McCumber and 
sophomore J.D. Tomlinson each shot a 75 (+5) on Tuesday. Mc-
Cumber totaled a 218 (+8), finish-
ing 20th on the individual lead-erboards. Tomlinson finished in a tie for 
25th. 
“It was a good way to finish 
against a strong field,” Alexan-der said. 
Florida has more than two 
weeks to prepare for its next chal-lenge of the season. UF will travel to Birmingham, Ala., for the Jerry Pate National Intercollegiate on Oct. 15. 
Alabama will host the tourna-
ment, which takes place at the Old Overton Country Club.

Florida junior Sofie Oyen 
and freshman Danielle Col-
lins traveled different roads to get to the qualifying round of the Riviera/ITA All-Amer -
ican Tournament in Pacific Palisades, Calif. 
But both roads led to the 
round of 16 on Tuesday.
“It was a very good day for 
Danielle and Sofie,” associate head coach Dave Balogh said. “[They] were in some tight spots ... during their matches 
and really stepped up their 
games at the end.”
No. 32 Oyen cruised 
through her first match against No. 76 Samantha Ad-ams of Texas Tech in two sets (6-2, 6-1) before winning her second match against No. 74 Alejandra Granillo of Pep-
perdine in three sets (2-6, 6-4, 
6-4).
During her freshman year 
in 2010, Oyen reached the third round of qualifying for the Riviera before falling short in three sets (6-4, 0-6, 6-2) to NC State’s Sanaa Bhambri. Oyen was hoping to improve 
upon her rookie result as a 
sophomore, but she was de-feated 6-3, 6-0 by then-No. 31 Brynn Boren of Tennessee. 
So far in 2012, Oyen has 
started on the right foot with a perfect 6-0 record in singles 
matches. 
Collins had no prior tour -
nament experience going into 
the Riviera. 
She continued her success 
on Tuesday, defeating No. 77 Li Xi from Virginia 6-4, 6-0 and No. 62 Kate Fuller from Georgia  6-4, 6-4. 
Collins is a perfect 8-0, in-
cluding four wins against top-100 opponents.
The Gators have been com-
peting in the Riviera/ITA All-American Tournament annu-ally since 2001 but are yet to have a player reach the main draw by advancing through 
both the pre-qualifying and 
qualifying rounds. Collins has 
the opportu-nity to end that streak. 
But she 
and Oyen have one more hill to 
climb before 
advancing to the final 
draw — a third match.
In the qualifying round of 
the ITA All-American Tourna-ment, the players have to win three consecutive matches to move on to the final draw.
Carolina Hitimana, Ol-
ivia Janowicz and Alexandra Cercone all suffered opening-round defeats. 
The third match for both 
players will be Wednesday. 
Both of the Gators will be 
looking to join senior Lauren Embree in the final draw, 
which will take place Thurs-
day through Sunday.
“Hopefully, we can get 
Danielle and Sofie to join Lau-ren in the main draw,” Balogh said. “They’ve been very fo-cused and it will be exciting and tough tennis.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2012

While Florida has surren-
dered only three sacks in two 
games since giving up eight 
against Texas A&M on Sept. 
8, LSU’s pass rush presents a stiffer test. 
As a result, coach Will 
Muschamp plans to make sure Driskel is not as vulner -
able should UF’s protection break down.
“They’re a difficult group 
to block,” Muschamp said. “(You have) got to get the ball out of your hand and stay multiple in what you do. 
You can’t get in a one-dimen-
sional game. You’ve got to change the launch point on the quarterback as much as 
you can.”
“You’ve got to kind of 
move him around,” Pease 
said. 
“You’ve got to sprint out. 
You’ve got to roll him a little bit. You’ve got to kind of change where he’s going to be so they can’t zero in.”
If switching up the launch 
point does not work, Driskel will have to do what he has done all season: scramble out of the pocket to try to make 
a play. 
Driskel’s dual-threat style has called for a sharper 
awareness by the offensive line, Harrison said.
“If we’ve seen the D-line-
men change direction of their rush, then we have to be alert and say, ‘OK, maybe Jeff is rolling out, so we just need to 
keep protecting,’” Harrison 
said. 
“It just emphasizes the fact 
that we need 
to protect as 
long as pos-
sible and not just give up or take 
a break on 
one play.”
S i n c e 
Muschamp called the Gators 
“soft” late last season, the 
offensive line has worked to shed that label. 
Harrison believes LSU’s 
defense will reveal how far 
Florida’s offensive line has 
come since 2011.
“The whole season, [Mus-
champ] said he wants to in-
crease the physicality of our 
team because we’re going to be a hard-nosed football team,” Harrison said. “As long as we get out there and 
we’re physical and mentally 
sharp, we’ll be a successful team.”

joemorgan@alligator.org.ranks 30th nationally.
“They roll with two different 
groups,” Pease said. 
“They’re rolling seven, eight 
or nine guys at times, but their four-man rush really gets to you, 
so they don’t have to do a lot of 
blitzing and scheme-wise (to) try to mix it up on you.”
Pease believes moving the ball 
through the air will be a challenge against LSU, so the run-to-pass ratio must remain near the 2-to-1 mark it has been so far this sea-son.
The Gators will need starting 
running back Mike Gillislee to play at the level he did against Bowling Green in Week 1, when 
he ran for 148 yards and two 
touchdowns on 24 carries. 
If Gillislee is anything short 
of that, backups Matt Jones and Mack Brown will need to have 
their best performances of the 
season. 
Jones and Brown have aver -
aged a combined 36 yards per 
game in 2012.
However, the players don’t 
think they will need a better-than-
average effort from the rushing attack.
Center Jonotthan Harrison said 
LSU’s pass rush wouldn’t put any more pressure on  Florida’s run game, noting that the Gators want to run the ball successfully no matter the opponent.
The running backs’ lead block-
er, fullback Hunter Joyer, also said the Gators do not need any special performances.
“If all of them have a good 
game, we’d be pretty successful,” Joyer said of the running backs.“I don’t think one guy needs to step up. I think one of them will in the 
course of the game, but I don’t 
think we really need it.”But they do need it. To ask Driskel to carry Flor -
ida to a win against LSU would be unreasonable. Pease said that 
load might fall on the shoulders 
of Gillislee. 
“If he needs to carry [the ball] 
30 times this time, he’ll carry it 
30,” Pease said. “If he’s got to car -
ry it 12, he’ll carry it 12.”Gators fans should hope Gil-
lislee ends up with more than 12 
carries. 
If he doesn’t, it will mean 
Florida fell behind and never had a chance to play the run-heavy style UF needs to top LSU on Sat-urday. 
Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurno-
voy@alligator.org.The offensive coordinator named 
his father as one of his mentors. To-
gether with his coaches, Pease’s fa-
ther taught his son how to be a pro-fessional on a day-to-day basis. 
“Especially with my dad, I had to 
do it out on the field but still come 
home to it every night and deal with 
that,” Pease said. “That’s always difficult. ... It was always good in the long run. You can see where it was beneficial.”
At Montana, Pease played quar -
terback under coach Tommy Lee.
Pease led the nation in total of-
fense in 1986. He played for the Grizzlies from 1985-86 after two years at Walla Walla (Wash.) Com-munity College.
“I probably started learning more 
football once I got into college with Tommy Lee and the Don Reed sys-tem, when I was throwing the ball in four wides and throwing the ball 55-60 times a game,” Pease said.
Lee is now the offensive coordi-nator at Hawaii. 
Pease worked with current 
Southern Methodist coach June Jones while playing with the Hous-ton Oilers from 1987-88. He served as a backup quarterback in the World League of American Foot-ball for the New York/New Jersey Knights, who were coached by  Darrel “Mouse” Davis.
Pease arrived at UF after spend-
ing five seasons coaching on Chris Peterson’s staff at Boise State.
“Definitely learned a lot about 
coaching quarterbacks from Mouse Davis,” Pease said. “I learned a lot with Chris Peterson [about] of-fense in general and him being a head coach. Those are the guys that have groomed me that I have taken things from.”
Driskel beyond his years: Jeff 
Driskel will be facing the biggest test of his young career on Saturday against LSU, but Pease doesn’t want the first-year starter to press. Pease said Driskel’s performance in the first four games should be enough to be successful, provided his team-
mates come through. 
“This isn’t about Jeff Driskel,” 
Pease said. “This is about 11 guys 
out there executing a plan.”
Pease only wants Driskel to 
continue progressing, as he’s done through UF’s first four games. That means taking care of the ball, man-aging the game and completing a high percentage of his passes.
Driskel has faced two Southeast-
ern Conference teams on the road in his first four career starts, which  hasn’t been done by a Florida quar -
terback since Chris Leak in 2003.
“He really is a mature guy,” Har -
rison said. “We love what we’re see-ing out of him. He’s been in some tough situations, even playing Ten-nessee on the road. It was a loud atmosphere. But of course, by the fourth quarter, it was a complete opposite as the stands were com-pletely empty.”

After Chloe Mann domi-
nated last season, coach Mary 
Wise knew the middle blocker 
would be at the top of every 
opponent’s watch list. 
Still, Wise wasn’t surprised 
when Mann played her best game of the season last week-end.
“You almost saw it coming 
because she had such a good practice Wednesday,” Wise said. 
“She was just doing some 
things, especially blocking. We talked to her about that, and she just brought it into Friday night’s match. She was 
in the zone.” 
The junior middle blocker 
set a career high with 20 kills. She hit a season-high .621 and 
added four blocks as No. 11 Florida defeated Southeastern Conference foe South Carolina 
3-1 (25-14, 25-23, 21-25, 25-17) 
on the road.
Mann topped her previous 
career-high of 19 kills, which she set on Nov. 13 in a five-set 
win against Arkansas.
But Mann’s weekend wasn’t 
over yet.
In only two sets during 
Sunday’s 3-0 (25-14, 25-9, 25-
18) win against Mississippi State, Mann had six kills with 
one error in eight swings for a 
.625 hitting clip. 
“When you talk about a basketball player who can’t miss, she was sort of like that,” Wise said. 
Prior to the season, Wise 
said Mann, Betsy Smith and Simone Antwi were going to be a huge part of UF’s point 
production. 
So far, Mann has proven 
her right.
By racking up a .407 hit-
ting efficiency, 157 kills and 38 blocks in 40 sets, Mann has 
accounted for 54 percent of the points earned by Florida’s middle blockers. 
Mann’s 3.92 kills per set are 
the most on the team.
The junior has also been 
one of the team’s best defen-sive players. 
She leads the team in both 
solo blocks with eight and block assists with 30. 
Mann’s contributions have 
helped the Gators  lead the nation with a .328 hitting ef-ficiency. 
She ranks third in the SEC 
in hitting percentage and fourth in kills. 
“Chloe is very compliant,” 
Wise said. “She has that per -
sonality, that attention to de-
tail; she’s a grinder. She fo-
cuses in on whatever aspect we’re asking her to and she just attacks it. I think that’s 
why she’s become the player 
that she is just now in her red-shirt junior year.”

For some players, changing from 
offense to defense would mean a 
major shift in focus. For Taylor Tra-vis, the switch only makes her more effective moving the offense.
“I’ve played in the attacking 
third a lot of my life,” Travis said. “It makes it a little easier to see cer -
tain options.”
This season, Travis made the 
switch from forward to outside back. Junior Maggie Rodgers and sophomores Tessa Andujar and Lauren Silver also play the position.
As outside backs, their job in 
Florida’s formation is to push the at-tack forward when the Gators have the ball and to defend the backline when opponents have control.
“They’re a big part of our of-
fense,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We rely on them a lot to provide some width in the attack.”
The outside backs have been a 
major reason the Gators have out-scored their opponents 11-2 during the past three games. They recorded assists on three of those goals.
Rodgers also delivered the cross that resulted in a hand ball against Georgia. Senior Jo Dragotta scored on the ensuing penalty kick, but 
Rodgers was not credited with an 
assist.
Burleigh said she rotates her 
players at outside back due to the demanding nature of the position.
Travis led the outside backs with 
62 minutes against Ole Miss while Andujar, Rodgers and Silver played between 28 and 48 minutes. In the 
win against Arkansas, all four re-
ceived between 41 and 45 minutes of playing time.
Because Burleigh keeps play-
ers rested, UF’s outside backs often wear out the opposing team.
“We say we work the girl that’s 
on us,” Andujar said. “We try to show for the ball all the time, going 
up and down the sidelines, trying to 
get the opponent tired.”
Travis said the outside backs 
playing forward give Florida the advantage against opponents who do not usually see that type of at-tack.
“Teams that play us aren’t used 
to getting those numbers put against 
them,” she said. “We almost add a 
lot of pressure … and help create more options.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2012
