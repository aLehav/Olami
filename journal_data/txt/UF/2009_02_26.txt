Raucous cheers filled the air outside of the Orange & 
Brew early Thursday morning as the Unite Party swept 
UF’s Student Government spring elections, taking 42 of the 50 available Senate seats as well as the Executive ticket.
Just after midnight, SG’s Supervisor of Elections Dan 
Siegel announced the domination of the Unite Party to the crowd of about 150. The Progress Party snagged eight Senate seats. 
The Orange & Blue Party and the Keg Party walked 
away empty-handed. 
Siegel said 9,847 stu-
dents voted in the election. Around 8,000 students 
voted in the 2008 spring election. 
The Unite crowd rippled with rhythmic cheers of 
“U-Unite! U-U-Unite!” as supporters hugged and high-fived each other outside the Reitz Union Game Room.
Victorious presidential candidate Jordan Johnson at-
tributed his win partly to a clean campaign and the pas-
sion of his party. 
He admitted there were other factors at play.
“We had really damn good Greek support,” Johnson 
said, before the results were announced.
Johnson’s parents attended the occasion. His mother, Darlene, had tears streaming down her 
face.
“We’re just elated,” she said. “It’s just in his blood. 
His dad’s a four-term state legislator. He grew up watch-
ing him. He was obviously paying attention.”  UF VOTERS UNITE

UF has asked the College of Education and 
the College of Nursing to submit proposals 
presenting the pros and cons of cutting their undergraduate education programs.
Those are the only two colleges that have 
been asked by UF to present such proposals, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
UF Provost Joe Glover wrote in an e-mail 
that both of the colleges have focused more on graduate education in recent years, and they were asked to examine the possibility of cutting undergraduate programs because of UF’s desire to focus more on graduate educa-tion and research, which was affirmed by the Board of Trustees at its annual retreat Friday.
Sikes said the education offered at both 
colleges could also be earned at other public universities in Florida and potentially at Santa 
Fe College.
Larry Lansford, College of Education 
spokesman, said the college has shifted to-
ward a focus in graduate education.Only 556 of more than 1,800 students in 
the college are enrolled in majors that have an undergraduate component, according to Lansford.
Undergraduates currently enrolled would 
be able to finish their degrees, he said.
The majors, elementary education and 
early childhood education, also include a fifth year of study that culminates in a master’s de-
gree.
But the fact that the college has been fo-
cusing more on graduate education doesn’t 
mean it’s eager to give up its undergraduate programs.
“It’s something we’ve been doing for over 
a hundred years,” Lansford said.
A letter addressed to UF officials and 
signed by 57 faculty members from the college also urges UF not to cut the programs.
A Facebook group called “Save Under-
graduate Education at UF,” which opposes the elimination of undergraduate programs at UF 
had more than 800 members as of Wednesday 
night.

Car with body in back seat had 7 tickets
GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — A car found in a Gainesville neigh-
borhood with a dead body in the back seat had been ticketed seven 
times by city parking enforcement.
Police found the body when a resident called authorities Mon-
day afternoon to report the car, which had been parked on the street for days. A preliminary autopsy helped police identify the body as 42-year-old John Waldo, who had been missing since Feb. 11. Police say the autopsy revealed no obvious cause of death. Investigators are awaiting toxicology results, which may take up to six weeks.
City records show the first ticket was issued to the 2001 BMW on 
Feb. 12, the day after Waldo was last seen alive.More than 9,800

Body rots in hearse, Ala. 
funeral director charged 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — 
A funeral director accused of leav-
ing a woman’s body to decay in a parked hearse after her relatives failed to pay the bill was arrested 
on a felony charge of abusing a 
corpse, police said Wednesday.
Watson and Sons Funeral 
Home embalmed the remains of Edna Kathleen Woods, 52, after she died of natural causes in No-vember 2007, said Gadsden police Sgt. Jeff Wright. Relatives wanted the body cremated but failed to 
sign the necessary paperwork or 
pay owner Harold Watson Sr., he said.
After storing the corpse at his 
funeral home for more than a year, Wright said, 76-year-old Watson decided to move it because he couldn’t reach the woman’s fam-ily.
Someone complained about a 
foul smell near downtown Gad-sden, about 60 miles northeast of Birmingham, and officers on Tues-day found the woman’s remains in a cardboard box that was inside a locked hearse parked on a piece of property that Watson owns.
Watson was arrested after offi-
cers tracked the hearse to him. The body apparently was in the hearse for about two months, and the bat-tery had been removed so no one could move the vehicle, Wright said.
Funeral directors with un-
claimed bodies can file a petition to have counties dispose of remains.
“He knows better. The family 
wouldn’t pay him, so he just got 
rid of it,” Wright said.
Watson was free on bond and 
did not immediately return a mes-
sage left at his funeral home. It was not immediately known if he had an attorney.
The head of the state office that 
regulates Alabama’s funeral in-dustry said Watson could lose his director’s license if convicted.

about passing safety, UPD Lt. Stacy Ettel said.
The detail’s goal is to inform 
the drivers what they are doing is 
wrong, not ticket them, he said.
“Our goal is education,” Ettel 
said. “The majority of our con-
tacts receive warnings.”
Another frequent viola-
tion, Ettel said, is when scooter and motorcycle drivers pass a stopped bus by driving into the bike lane. 
During the detail, Officer Will 
Sasser pulled over a Mazda van that drove past a barricade near Turlington Hall.
When Sasser asked for iden-
tification the driver introduced himself as James Williams and told Sasser his driver’s license was suspended.
According to the UPD arrest 
report, when Sasser did a check on Williams, he found that Wil-liams had a record of about 10 traffic violations. 
Williams was arrested, taken 
to the Alachua County Jail and charged with a third-degree felo-ny for driving with a suspended 
license and being a habitual of-
fender.

Police: Miami music 
teacher kills family, self 
MIAMI (AP) — A gifted mu-
sician and teacher whose piano 
students included his neighbors’ children fatally shot his wife and two daughters then himself in 
the family’s Miami home, police 
say, leaving those who described him as friendly and helpful to wonder what happened.
Police haven’t released the 
names of those killed Wednes-day morning, but neighbors identified them as 53-year-old Pablo Josue Amador, his 45-year-
old wife, Maria, and their young-
est daughters, Priscila and Rosa, 12 and 11. A teenage son escaped the shootings uninjured, calling 911 at 5:58 a.m. as he fled the home, police said.
A biography of Amador 
posted on a Web site advertising his piano classes says he began studying music in Havana and later earned a degree in the U.S. The U.S. Copyright Office lists 36 compositions by him and a set of photographs. The songs he wrote, many in Spanish, includ-ed titles such as “Beautiful Boy” and “Rose of Love,” as well as numerous religious selections.
Sarait Betancourt, a 44-year-
old school bus driver who lives near the family, said Amador was a Cuban immigrant who has been giving her two sons, ages 9 and 10, piano lessons at his home once a week since 2006.

and a tremendous professor,” 
she said. “People would enter WHAT’S HAPPENINGRed Cross Gators CPR Training

The FBI searched the office of 
UF professor Samim Anghaie for 
suspected fradulent grant propsals to NASA on Wednesday.
Investigators showed up at 
the office in the Nuclear Science Building just before 8 a.m. and left around 3:30 p.m., said UF spokes-man Steve Orlando.
The search was part of an inves-
tigation being conducted by mul-tiple federal agencies, according to a U.S. Attorney’s Office news release.
A search warrant alleges there 
is cause to believe that Anghaie’s company, New Era Technology (NETECH), intentionally over-
paid Anghaie while underpaying 
other employees and creating ille-gitimate employees that were paid money through the grants.
“NETECH… diverted hundreds 
of thousands of dollars of illegally obtained government funds from their corporate bank account to their personal bank accounts,” it 
stated.The warrant stated employees 
of the company used some of the 
money to buy land, a condomini-
um and vehicles, including a 2007 
BMW.
The company 
received about $2.5 million in grants from NASA since 2000, according to the warrant.
Anghaie is listed as the direc-
tor/vice president of the company, 
according to the warrant.His wife, Sousan, is listed as the 
president.
Their son Hamid is listed as the 
director. Their other son, Ali, is 
listed as an employee in some of the grants.
The warrant stated that there is 
cause to believe the four of them violated federal laws with offenses including theft of public money, mail or wire fraud and laundering of monetary instruments.
Orlando said, to his knowledge, 
no other UF employees are being investigated.
Orlando said Anghaie, who earns a salary of $111,401.53 at UF, has been placed on paid admin-istrative leave, which is standard procedure when an employee is involved in an investigation of this nature.
Anghaie has worked at UF since 
October of 1980, Orlando said.
He said UF is cooperating with 
the investigation but referred fur-ther comment to the U.S. Attor-ney’s Office, which did not return phone calls Wednesday.
Officials at NASA and the FBI 
could not be reached for com-
ment.

� THE BUILDING WAS A TOTAL LOSS.
A Gainesville building burned to the 
ground early Wednesday morning, destroy-
ing the office of a chiropractic group and of the non-profit organization Peaceful Paths.
Gainesville Police officers discovered the 
fire at 2100 NW 53rd Ave. at 1:30 a.m. while on routine patrol. Nobody was in the offices, and there were no injuries, said Carol Davis, spokeswoman for Gainesville Fire Rescue.
When GFR arrived, flames were 40 feet high 
and the Peaceful Paths building had sustained significant damages. Firefighters focused on preventing the fire from spreading. 
Peaceful Paths is a non-profit organization 
that assists domestic violence victims.The fire also consumed a building that 
housed Physicians Group, LLC, but it did not 
spread to nearby apartments. 
“They were able to get it un-
der control fairly quickly,” Da-vis said.
Trish White, case manager 
for Peaceful Paths, said that the organization will rebuild as soon as possible. She said ser-vices will lapse only about a week while the organization arranges a temporary office.
People have offered money, supplies and 
even office space to help the organization deal with the loss.
“We know that we will land on our feet,” 
White said.

So begins another season of 
people giving up luxuries for God.
Wednesday kicked off the 40 
day Lenten Journey for the Catho-
lic, Lutheran and Anglican reli-
gions.
Jennifer Kacerosky, a Catho-
lic UF senior,  said that on Ash Wednesday, members of the 
Catholic religion bring their palm 
fronds from the previous year’s Palm Sunday to mass.
The fronds are burned and the 
ashes are smeared on the foreheads 
of Catholics in the shape of a cross 
to symbolize cleansing.
Kacerosky said she is not giv-
ing up anything this year. Instead, she will be adding routines to her 
daily life to better her relationship 
with God.
“I’m planning on going to daily 
mass and praying the Rosary ev-ery day,” Kacerosky said. “I have 
always had a problem with pray-
ing the Rosary daily and I think Lent would be a perfect time for 
me to start.”  
“I’m giving up sleep,” joked 
Mike Walsh, 46.As a stay-at-home dad, Walsh 
said he hasn’t slept in five years 
because of his three young daugh-ters.
“I’m really giving up vulgari-
ties,” Walsh said. “Not all of them, just various ones.”
Walsh said he doesn’t like it 
when his 4-and-a-half-year-old re-
peats them.
UF Senior Nelson Burke said 
two years ago, 
he gave up sex.
“It was horri-
ble,” Burke said. 
“Lent is really long.”
He said the experience he had 
two years ago was just like that 
of Josh Hartnett’s character in 
the 2002 movie “40 Days and 40 
Nights.”
“It does let you bring your re-
lationship to different levels when 
sex isn’t involved,” Burke said, 
adding that the person he was dat-
ing wasn’t always happy about his decision.
Catholic Charities Employee 
Sabrina Miller, 24, said she is going 
to be taking better care of herself 
for Lent this year.
“I am going to benefit myself 
by eating healthy and exercising,” 
Miller said. “I’m going to start be-ing more positive and less bitchy.”
Paul and Kelly Darby attend-
ed the 7 p.m. mass as converting 
Catholics.Kelly, 27, said she was born a 
Catholic but never went through confirmation.
She said she will be giving up gossiping, while her husband Paul, 25, will be giving up salt.
“Everything is going to taste 
boring from now on,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2009

A former Miss Florida and UF 
alumna spoke  about her struggles 
with an eating disorder to about 30 students and faculty Wednesday night  on the Plaza of the Americas.
UF’s first “Lights of Hope” can-
dle-lighting ceremony was held in honor of National Eating Disorders Awareness Week 2009. People lis-tened to speeches and stories from those who are or have been strug-gling and lit candles in memory of those who have passed away and in honor of those still fighting.
Allison L. Kreiger, president 
and founder of H.O.P.E — Helping Other People Eat — as well as Miss Florida 2006, was the keynote speak-er for the night’s event and detailed 
her struggle with the disease and 
her road to recovery.
“My eating disorder was nothing 
about me losing weight,” she told the group. “I felt like I had lost con-trol of my life and my feelings were transferred into the disorder.”
Kreiger said that as a young 
girl she was always in a competi-
tive environment because she was 
a baton twirler and was constantly practicing.  When high school came around, she became frustrated and realized that she wanted to be a “normal” kid with a social life.
“I came home from the gym one 
day and I didn’t mean to throw up, but I did, and it made me feel bet-
ter,” she said.  “Eventually, I would 
only eat to get sick because it made me feel better in my mind — it be-came an addiction.”
When Kreiger realized that she 
couldn’t focus and that she had lost her endurance in the gym, she ap-
proached her parents and told them 
about her problem.  She was disap-pointed, however, when they didn’t know what to do about the situation.  After a few months, she tried again and this time, they were prepared.  
“I was terrified that I wouldn’t be around the next day,” she said.  
“I realized how precious life was, 
and that was the pivotal point.”  
Kreiger was taken to an outpatient facility to receive treatment.  When she arrived at UF as a freshman, she went straight to the Student Health Care Center and began helping oth-ers.  
Her efforts grew and  eventually 
became her platform for the Miss America competition, she said.  
“It’s one of the best feelings — 
even if it’s just having a shoulder to cry on — to be that means of saving lives,” she said.  “I feel fortunate to still be around to fulfill that bigger purpose in life.”
After her speech, the group 
formed a circle and lit purple candles.  
“With each candle flame, we re-member,” said Dr. Lisa J. Merlo, as-
sistant professor at UF’s psychiatry 
department.  “We light to guide us toward a better tomorrow.”
Once the candles were burning, 
guests had a chance to share their stories, or the story of someone they knew.  The crowd was timid at first, but after sophomore Katie Popeil told her story, others were willing to 
as well.
Popeil, who has had her disorder 
for about four years, said she’s been 
in recovery for about six months.  
“Hearing Allison’s story made 
me confident that I can achieve re-covery and live the life I’ve wanted,” she said. “If you’re struggling, reach out. I waited a long time, and I’m 
having a harder time recovering be-
cause I was so wrapped up in it.”

Have the prayers of short-lashed ladies 
everywhere finally been answered?
A new FDA-approved prescription drug 
that claims to provide a visible difference in 
your lash length, color and thickness will 
soon be available to Gainesville residents.
“It’s as easy as wiping eyeliner on every 
day,” said Dr. Miranda Whitmer a derma-
tologist at Gainesville Dermatology Aes-thetic Center.
The drug is a variation of Lumigan, the company’s glaucoma medication.  Doctors found the solution was improving hair loss on glaucoma patient’s lash line, and began 
testing Latisse.
At this point, Allergan can’t pinpoint ex-
actly why the drug stimulates growth, but 
it believes the drug increases the amount of hair grown during the growth cycle, accord-
ing to a blog by Scientific American.
Close to 80 percent of people that used 
Latisse saw an increase in fullness, darkness 
and length by week 16, with a 106 percent increase in fullness alone, according to the 
product’s Web site.
The trick, however, is keeping up with 
the treatments. There is still debate on how often treatment should continue to maintain results, Whitmer said.
One bottle is about $120 and comes with 
60 applicators, or a 30-day supply.  
The application process is simple, she 
said. Before going to sleep each 
night place a drop of the solu-tion onto an applicator, rubbing it at the base of your upper eye-
lashes. 
Lash extensions, a more traditional al-
ternative to enhancing lashes, can cost anywhere from $20 to $50 and last about two weeks. They can cause damage to the 
lashes underneath, said Tara Andrisin, a 
physician’s assistant for dermatology at Gainesville Dermatology Aesthetic Center.
UF freshman Christina Frick said she has been using fake eyelashes for dance perfor-mances since high school, and she spends around $12 for one tube of mascara. 
“For $2, I can deal with annoying eyelash 
glue,” she said. “This drug may eventually be worth my money, but I’m pretty skepti-cal.”
With the hefty $120 price tag, UF sopho-
more Lisa Marx said she would only shell out the money for rapid results.
“If I’m paying that much money, I should 
be able to see a difference in four minutes not four weeks,” she said. 
Overall, the product is going to benefit 
those that want the look of makeup with-out having to take the extra time to put it on 
each day, Andrisin said.FDS approves new drug promising thicker eyelashes

Don’t Hate
Amendment 1 a leap 
backward for civil rights

Amendment will harm local businesses
Today’s question: Did you vote in the Student Government elections?Wednesday’s question: Did you watch Obama’s speech last night?
201 TOTAL VOTES41% YES59% NOAs one of the most progressive cities in the U.S., Gainesville 
prides itself on being a place where people from all walks of life can reside without fear of discrimination.
Americans across the nation descend upon our city with 
hopes of being treated fairly regardless of their sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity. In Gainesville, citizens do not have to 
worry about losing their jobs or homes because they identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Simply put, people are protected by local anti-discrimination laws to ensure that the quality of life is consistent for everyone that calls the city home.
Sadly, the quality of life in Gainesville may change forever if 
we do not take action against a devious agenda.
March 24th’s city election ballot will feature a proposed 
amendment to the Gainesville City Charter titled, “Charter 
Amendment 1.” If passed, the bill will eliminate the city’s power 
to legally protect citizens from discrimination and instead hand that power over to the state. This legislation seeks to unfairly strip the rights of innumerable citizens – a gross misstep back-ward for a country that prides itself as open to “change.”
By saying “yes” to Charter Amendment 1, city law would no 
longer recognize Gainesville’s Human Rights Ordinance and be forced to revert to the Florida Civil Rights Act. Unfortunately, there is a stark difference between the two pieces of legislation 
as the state act does not include protection for gender identity 
or sexual orientation. Furthermore, Gainesville would not have the opportunity to add additional protections in the future to ensure equal rights regarding veteran status, socio-economic status and political party affiliation. Existing special protections would be stripped the moment the act was passed.
Gainesville is hardly alone in championing anti-discrimina-
tion protections for all of its residents. There are more than 100 other cities across the country who have adopted a progressive 
mentality to ensure that every citizen can lead a life without the 
fear of hate. If Gainesville loses its ability to provide a place to live free of inequality and discrimination, who is to say that the other cities won’t soon face a similar fate?
The issue at hand is not about whether you agree or disagree 
with the lifestyle choices of a critical portion of our population. Rather, you must ask yourself if you believe that all Americans should be able to enjoy the most basic of civil rights.
The issue is not about “men in women’s bathrooms,” and 
it’s not about the breadth of local government. Our city govern-ment has a responsibility to its citizens to protect them from un-fair treatment. Gainesville has gone to great lengths to protect all its citizens from institutionalized hate and has extended pro-tection to groups of people who face oppression from all angles. With the passage of this amendment, people who already live as second-class citizens would lose all legal recourse against dis-crimination – their livelihoods could be yanked out from under them, and all they could do is suck it up and move. Gay, lesbian, 
bisexual and transgender people must then fight even harder 
within a system that already considers them inferior.
Such an example paints a bleak picture in the minds of the 
Editorial Board. We wonder how far-right groups can possibly rationalize such outlandish legislation when it clearly exudes overtones of sheer hate.
Gainesville cannot be forced to take a step backward consid-
ering all of the progress that we’ve made. When people think of our city, they must be able to view it as a model for how equal-ity can and will work anywhere in the country.
If passed, Charter Amendment 1 would hinder the city’s 
ability for growth as businesses, and students will have no 
choice but to go elsewhere.
With the livelihoods of so many innocent people at stake, we 
implore you to take a strong stand against discrimination and 
vote “no” on Charter Amendment 1. Has anyone actually read Gainesville Charter 
Amendment 1? Or more importantly, has any-one actually read the ordinance that it will af-
fect?
Yes, the amendment will remove language explicitly 
prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. This essentially amounts to repeal-
ing the changes passed to the Gainesville Ordinance 
No. 051225 on Jan. 28, 2008.
In other words, the amendment will make Gainesville 
discrimination laws the same as everywhere else in Ala-chua County.
Anti-discrimination laws are a good thing, and most 
people, including the drafters of the amendment, agree that businesses should not discriminate based on gen-der identity. Unfortunately, the language of the ordi-
nance is so broad that it would constitute an unjust en-
croachment into the rights of private business.
The amendments passed in 2008 do not simply add 
gender identity to a list of prohibited reasons for dis-crimination. They also added a large section ( Section 
8-69 (c) ) that concern “shared facilities” such as rest-
rooms and locker rooms.
A business cannot deny use of such a facility on the 
basis of gender identity unless the business provides 
“adequate facilities” to accommodate the person’s gen-
der identity. The ordinance then goes on to define uni-sex restrooms as an “adequate facility.”
In other words, businesses may be forced to build 
expensive new facilities in addition to existing men’s 
and women’s rooms. This is an unfair and economically 
unfeasible assault on local businesses.
The definition of gender identity is also disturbing. Anyone who professes to be either gender “by verbal state-ment” will be legally entitled 
to use the restroom of his or 
her choice.
While there are some trans-
gendered people this would 
benefit, there are many people 
who would be made uncom-fortable at the thought of any-
one being able to enter a ladies’ room. This would hurt businesses within the city limits.
Amendment 1 is not about legalizing “discrimination 
based on… sexual identity,” as the Alligator reported on Monday. First off, it’s “gender identity.”
If businesses want to discriminate, they can easily 
move a few miles outside of the city limits.  Many local businesses are already outside the city limits and thus it is “legal” to discriminate.
Of course, the overwhelming majority of these busi-
nesses don’t discriminate on sexual orientation or gen-
der identity. If this happened, there would be pages of 
discrimination claims filling the pages of this newspa-per. Notice their absence.
I fully support laws which ban discrimination based 
on sexual orientation and gender identity, but the Gainesville city ordinance goes beyond that to harm our local businesses in order to appear progressive. I say “appear” progressive because the city actually exempts itself from the ordinance.

Letter to the Editor
Words taken out of context
In Wednesday’s article that cov-
ered President Bernie Machen’s 
town hall forum, I was appalled to see that what I said was taken out of context in order to beef up a medio-
cre story.
I would like for the readership of 
the Alligator to note that I fully sup-port the administration in this time 
and completely understand that the administration is unable to know at this point what will happen next year.
While I am worried that my pro-
gram may be cut, I am more worried that the UF student body will take what this writer said to be accurate. This town hall forum was open to the student body and gave Machen the ability to reach out to students and see what their concerns were, which is genuinely what happened. Had the reporter been listening to the forum and not circling the room like paparazzo, she would have no-ticed that.As for how my quote was taken 
out of context, I am ashamed of the quality of the Alligator’s writing staff. I would call this article a fa-cade of muckraking journalism, but I am afraid that this term would be too lenient on the writer. I implore the editors of the Alligator to invest more time in reading the articles presented to them by their staff. 
Not only will this raise the writ-
ing quality from poor to mediocre, but also change its image from be-ing the tabloid with the crossword to being a respectable piece of jour-nalism.

On the Colbert Report recently, there 
was a joke in which Stephen pretend-ed it was 1997 and wheeled out an old 
dial-up modem, which he used to connect to America Online. And, just like that, I was 
nostalgic. 
How I missed that grating dial-up process 
and the frequent disconnections. 
But, through the nostalgia, as I surfed the 
Internet effortlessly on my fancy wireless 
laptop, I started thinking about just how far technology has come — and how weird the world will be to us 20 years from now.
Being the raconteur that I am, maybe a 
story will help illustrate my point. A few days ago I was hanging out with a good friend of mine. We were just talking, joking about ran-dom things — pretty much the usual. Then we both got text messages. For about the next 15 minutes, we barely said a word as each of us got absorbed in sending and replying to several texts at once. And what’s absolutely hilarious — what makes me laugh to no end — is that this is what, today, passes for two people hanging out.
Remember the days before text messaging 
— before cell phones even  — when in order 
to hang out people actually had to (weird, 
huh?) talk to each other. A person could get hit with a wave of social anxiety just thinking about it. I can’t wait to see what things are like for the next generation or so. 
I fully expect children to invite their 
friends over after school and each of them plug into their very own virtual reality head-set. One could be playing baseball, one at a 
concert (the thought of how strange music 
will be in the future, considering that in 50 short years we went from Sinatra to Nirvana, terrifies me) and another, assuming global warming leaves us with any water, could be jet-skiing. And this kind of intensive social interaction would be reserved only for the best of friends! The comedy of 
the future as some sort of introvert’s paradise aside, let me say that I 
firmly believe that 
technology is stran-gling us all. As al-ways, technologi-cal advances are about “could” and 
not “should.” I mean, is there really anyone alive who thinks the iPod Shuffle was a good idea? Technology is increasingly cutting us 
off not only from the world but from one an-
other. Today a person doesn’t even have to leave his home to buy groceries. One can do all their “social” interaction on the Internet, if so inclined. 
We’re becoming a society of pale vam-
pires — and not the Edward Cullen type so praised on the message boards.Technology has, of course, done great 
things for the world. Medical advances have saved countless lives, and only a Tyler Durden-style Luddite would want to undo such things. But the fact remains that some 
advances of technology — generally in the 
field of mass communication — cause just as much harm, if not more, than they do good. 
I’m reminded of a fantastic scene from 
“Inherit the Wind” where Henry Drum-mond tells us that “Gentlemen, progress has never been a bargain. You’ve got to pay for it. Sometimes I think there’s a man behind a counter who says, ‘All right, you can have a 
telephone, but you’ll have to give up privacy, 
the charm of distance…Mister, you may con-quer the air, but the birds will lose their won-der, and the clouds will smell of gasoline!’”
Think about it. And, please, do it outside 
and with some IRL friends.

Johnson’s father, Randy, R-Cele-
bration, was a representative in the 
Florida House from 1998 to 2006. 
“We’re very proud. Jordan has 
dedicated himself to the students,” 
he said. 
Meanwhile, the losing parties 
stood dejectedly, shaking their 
heads. 
“This just shows what happens 
when the independent movement can’t get on the same page when they’re facing a behemoth,” said Sen. Mark McShera, presidential 
candidate for the Orange & Blue 
Party. 
Meanwhile, Progress Party presi-
dential candidate Ben Dictor took a drag on his cigar at the announce-ment of Unite’s Executive win.
“We demonstrated to the Student 
Body that an independent body can run and be victorious,” he said, add-
ing the party has made a name for 
itself. 
Current Student Body President 
Kevin Reilly shouted, high-fived, hugged and fist-pumped when Johnson was announced as his suc-cessor. 
“I was surprised. I was expect-
ing a run-off,” Reilly said. “I think 
I’m leaving Student Government in 
very good hands.” Results for the ballot’s refer-
endum questions were also an-nounced, including one initiative to deny SG funding to facilities that require use of biometric data, such as a hand scan, for entry. About 64 percent of students voted to have a 
tobacco-free campus, and about 68 
percent supported creating a fund for UF’s BabyGator program. Also, 88 percent voted in favor of chang-ing Florida law to allow an Early Voting location on campus. 
The last day of campaigning in-
volved a strong push from all par-ties involved. Many touted party 
signs between Turlington Plaza and 
Plaza of the Americas. 
When polls closed at 8 p.m., par-
ty members headed out to pop open a few beers and relax before meeting at the Orange & Brew around mid-night to hear results.   
About 30 members of the Prog-
ress Party packed the outside patio 
of Tim and Terry’s, the local pub 
known for its live music and gritty atmosphere. 
The air was thick with cigar 
smoke and live jazz music from inside. At least three cases of Pabst Blue Ribbon were ordered before the party headed over to congregate at the Orange & Brew. 
The mood was optimistic but 
cautious as candidates discussed their chances. “Whether or not we won the 
war just yet, I don’t know, but we definitely beat the counter revolu-tionaries,” the party’s presidential candidate Ben Dictor said, wearing a maroon beret and leather Member’s Only jacket. 
Meanwhile, the mood was cel-
ebratory at The Swamp Restaurant, the top floor of which was rented out by the Unite Party. About 75 party supporters attended, drinking and chatting about the election season 
Down the way, about 30 Orange 
& Blue Party supporters gathered at Gator City to hang out before 
heading over to the Orange & Brew 
around 10:30 p.m.
Cheers of “Let’s Go Gator” rang 
out from members of the Orange & Blue Party when the Unite Party ar-rived at the Orange & Brew around midnight, referring to their claim that the Unite Party and the Gator Party from last fall are one in the 
same. The Progress Party was the 
first to arrive around 10:45 p.m. oc-casionally launching into a deep baritone rendition of “Solidarity Forever.”
Most parties shelled out more 
than $5,000 for their campaigns. The Orange & Blue Party spent $5,204.50 and the Progress Party spent $5,152.35. The Unite Party surpassed both, spending $8,324.54, while the Keg Party, which only ran candidates for the executive ticket raised about $200.
The night’s beer tab was about 
$370 at the Orange & Brew. 
The Orange & Blue Party also 
dropped $720 on airing campaign ads against the Unite Party. McShera 
said he did not regret airing the ads.
“The fact that Jordan Johnson 
doesn’t think he has to follow Flor-
ida law is worth voters knowing,” he said, referring to the ad in which Johnson is quoted during an Elec-tions Commission meeting. Progress Party candidate Nick 
Mildebrath criticized the ad.
“On every level the ad was crap,” 
Mildebrath said. 
Johnson said he felt rewarded for 
running a clean campaign.
“Nobody wants to hear you say 
bad things about somebody, espe-cially when they’re not true,” he said. 
There have been about 40 elec-
tions complaints filed this campaign season. The last 15, filed Wednes-day, will be discussed Friday.
cutting the college’s undergraduate programs 
could save. The college had a budget of about 
$29 million in 2007-2008, he said.
The College of Nursing, which had a bud-get of almost $13 million in 2007-2008, not in-cluding grants and private funds, has also been shifting its focus to graduate education, said Tracy Wright, the college’s spokeswoman.
She said the college has not been planning 
to eliminate the programs, however, and she didn’t know how much the move could save.The college has 394 graduate students and 
340 undergraduates cur-rently enrolled. Another 333 freshmen and sopho-mores are hoping to get 
into the undergraduate program when they become juniors, she said.Both Lansford and Wright said they 
couldn’t say if professors would be laid off if undergraduate programs were cut and stressed the fact that no decisions have been made yet.
“It’s one of many alternatives to deal with 
the budget cuts,” Wright said.
No decisions have been made in either college to cut undergrad programs

In less than eight days you will be home free for a week, but really, who 
wants to go home? It’s not too late to plan your dream vacation, and since 
you’re already in the spring break state, you don’t have to go too far to have 
some bronzed fun.         
1) South Beach
Consider Ocean Drive your spring break home base, and make nightlife your 
lifestyle this week. Plus it’s where Shakira calls home, so you know it’s hot. 
2) St. Augustine
St. Augustine may not be your traditional spring break hotspot, but if you’re 
feeling like a Ghostbuster, get your fix of graveyard tours and gimmicky 
adventures all within sight of the ocean.
3) Disney World
Relive the days of Disney princesses and Neverland. Partying with Mickey 
isn’t cheap, but at least you won’t have to worry about any poor, drunken 
judgment calls here. But there’s always Pleasure Island.
4) Key West
With all the charm of a small town, but all the nautical frills of the beach, 
you won’t leave Key West without a tan — or a run-in with a crazy local.

Slumdog 
more than 
love story
Sometimes good does triumph 
over evil, impossible odds are 
overcome and the hero kisses the 
girl right before the credits roll. 
Sounds pretty cheesy right?
Danny Boyle’s Mumbai fairytale 
“Slumdog Millionaire” embodies 
all of the heartwarming qualities 
of many rags-to-riches tales. But 
despite the obvious clichés that 
accompany any star-crossed love 
story, “Slumdog Millionaire” is a 
fully realized introspection on the 
human condition beset by pov -
erty and thrown 
out into a cruel 
world. And al -
though the road 
to redemption 
is at times far-
fetched, the end 
of the journey is 
so fulfilling that 
this story of love 
and perseverance trumps any is -
sue of believability.    
“Slumdog Millionaire” strad -
dles two story arcs throughout the 
film, depicting the lead charac -
ter Jamal’s stint on India’s “Who 
Wants to be a Millionaire” while 
delving through the back story 
of the boy’s troubled and violent 
childhood. A family life fractured 
by death and poverty leads Jamal 
and his brother Salim to grow up 
quickly in the slums of India. 
What is so clever about the film 
is the interweaving of the flash -
backs with the real-time events 
surrounding the game show. Each 
question that Jamal answers on 
his way toward the 20 million ru -
pee prize was known because of a 
chance encounter or random event 
from his past. Jamal is forced to 
reveal his reasoning behind each 
answer because at the film’s start, 
he is in jail on suspicion for cheat -
ing on the game show. How can 
a poor, uneducated kid from the 
slums really know the answer to 
every question?  
The film’s strength is in its en -
grossing story. Three sets of actors 
portray the leads in the film, de -
picting the evolution of the char -
acters Jamal, Salim and Latika 
against the evolution of the city of 
Mumbai itself. While no one actor 
carries the film or delivers those 
singular lines that films go down 
in history for, the movie proceeds 
to entice and entertain.
It seems fitting that a movie de -
picting the triumph of the human 
spirit over incredible odds would 
rely on an ensemble cast and a 
strong script to reach Oscar glory. 
“Slumdog Millionaire” won eight 
of the 10 Academy Awards it was 
nominated for Sunday, including 
Best Picture, Best Director and 
Best Adapted Screenplay. 
“Slumdog Millionaire” delivers 
on its fairytale promise, providing 
a two-hour escape into a world 
where “happily ever after” doesn’t 
seem that far-fetched after all. JACK BENGE

sex on the avenueFacebook, BlackBerry makes cheating difficult
In a world where more is better, mo -
nogamy can sometimes lead us down a 
boring path. With more than 50,000 stu -
dents at UF, why only date one person? 
Who wants to be stuck with only one 
make-out partner when you can have 
two, three or even four?
We’re in college, and it’s the time 
in our life when hormones are at an 
all-time high, flying around University 
Avenue late at night seeking a drunken 
mate to stumble back to the dorms with 
us. And, hey, there’s no problem with 
that. 
It’s time to experience, to get out 
there and see what life has to offer. Lov -
ers are easily comparable to a pair of 
shoes. You have to try on a few pairs on 
before finding the perfect fit.  
However, while fooling around with 
two (or more) people at once may sound 
fun and liberating, it might not be so 
feasible. 
Sleeping and sneaking around used to be so simple. George would go out 
with Sally on Thursday night for din -
ner at Dragonfly and then meet up with 
Sue at Swamp for a drink later that same 
night. And there were no problems. 
But now, Sally will write on George’s 
wall as soon as she gets home to thank 
him for dinner, and this post will cer -
tainly show up on 
Sue’s news feed — or 
at least on one of her 
friends’, who will im -
mediately text Sue 
to let her know what 
George has really been 
up to. 
I’m here to tell you 
that while it may be fun and extra-plea -
surable to have a secondary sex buddy, 
you are not safe anywhere. 
It’s a small world, boys and girls, and 
there’s no chance you’ll be able to get 
away with fooling around with more 
than one person without the other per -son — or people — finding out. 
With technology out of control, it’s 
too quick and easy for someone to catch 
you and snap a picture on his or her 
BlackBerry without you even knowing. 
If you’re familiar with the “Gossip 
Girl” TV show, you know exactly what 
I’m talking about. If not, I’m sure you 
can imagine. Simply touching the small 
of a girl’s back for a quick second with 
a smile on your face 
can be captured by a 
camera phone and ex -
ploited even easier via 
Facebook.  
And while being 
caught on camera and 
later online is what 
nobody hopes for, it’s 
relatively effortless to get yourself out 
of one of these situations. 
“Oh that guy? Just a friend I know 
from Tutoring Zone. We were taking 
a shot in honor of being done with the 
class.” This can quickly sum up and ex -
cuse a photo. The inquirer might still have his or her doubts, but for the most 
part, you’ll be in the clear. 
What’s even worse than being caught 
technologically, though, is being caught 
in person. Like I said, this small world 
doesn’t keep you safe enough, and most 
on-the-spot excuses seem made up. 
Plus, if you do get caught in person, 
even a brilliant excuse won’t hide the 
remorseful look on your face. 
So, the question remains: to cheat or 
not to cheat? My suggestion is to weigh 
the pros and cons. 
Chances are if you’re even think -
ing about cheating or sneaking around 
behind someone’s back, you probably 
don’t care enough about him or her 
anyway, meaning that getting caught 
wouldn’t be the end of the world. 
But if the person you might cheat on 
is worth something to you, don’t screw 
it up (no pun intended), no matter how 
horny you may be. Trying out a bunch 
of different make-out partners certain -
ly has its perks, but back to the shoes, 
there’s nothing like a perfect fit. For all the crazy onstage 
antics and dramatic perfor -
mances, Gregg Gillis is a mod -
est man. 
He makes no pretenses of 
living a high-profile rock-star 
life or being the coolest kid on 
the block.
“When I’m home I just work 
on music or watch TV on the 
couch,” he said. 
“When I perform, it’s my 
weekend as much as anyone 
else’s.”
He feels no need to include 
that his weekends, unlike 
most others’, take him from 
his hometown of Pittsburgh to 
Paris, San Francisco and Spain, 
where he moves crowds of up 
to thousands of people into a 
frenzy. 
“People don’t realize the 
level of safety and security 
measures taken before a show 
to prepare for craziness that 
will go down,” he said. 
Gillis has been perform -
ing as Girl Talk for the past 10 
years, but since 2006, with the 
release of “Night Ripper,” Girl 
Talk’s success caught on at an 
infectious rate. 
He credits the album’s suc -
cess with timing. At about that 
time, people were more famil -
iar with the idea of remixing 
music, and media had become 
very interactive, he said. 
The taboos that were in 
place in the underground 
scene of sampling pop music 
were fading. 
“Before, there was this feel -
ing that if I was sampling a 
Donnas song, I was pissing 
people off or going against 
their aesthetic,” he said. 
“Now in the indie or under -ground scene it’s not sacrilege 
to mix with Britney.”
Girl Talk came along and 
filled the area where experi -
mental music met accessibil -
ity. The media caught hold of 
the album and fans haven’t 
stopped dancing since. 
“I knew it was more accessi -
ble, but I didn’t know it would 
be so big,” he said. 
For a year he held down his 
job as a biomedical engineer, 
playing gigs only on the week -
end and on 
days off. 
He was 
happy to 
keep a day 
job and ex -
pand his 
side project, 
but the mo -
ment came 
when he had to choose. 
“All of a sudden I was head -
lining and selling out shows 
and getting offers to go to Eu -
rope,” he said. “I had to make 
the obvious choice.”
While most musicians and 
even most other people would 
drop their lives in a heartbeat 
for the chance to record and 
perform music full time, Girl 
Talk was more hesitant. 
“It was unprecedented that 
anyone made a living out of 
this,” Gillis said. 
“The biggest guy [in my 
genre] I looked up to, at the 
most played to 1000 people in 
Cleveland, I thought ‘Wow I’ll 
never be that big.’”
Before Girl Talk became an 
international phenomenon, 
Gillis was playing to crowds 
of 30 people or less, making 
enough money to cover gas. Now his live shows yield 
enough revenue to make a liv -
ing. 
“Feed the Animals,” Girl 
Talk’s latest album, is sold at 
whatever price fans set. 
Following the path of Ra -
diohead and Nine Inch Nails, 
Girl Talk accepts the reality of 
music on the Internet. 
Girl Talk gives fans the op -
tion to take the album free, as 
they can easily do online any -
way, or contribute as much as 
they want. 
“Live shows are what make 
a living. If I hadn’t made any 
money off “Feed the Animals,” 
I would have been OK,” he 
said. 
“I feel very lucky to be able 
to live off my fan base.” 
He reciprocates by allowing 
his fans to be part of the show. 
Girl Talk shows are a constant 
flow of the audience and per -
former feeding off each other. 
The man behind the laptop 
will just as soon run into the 
crowd and steal someone’s 
beer as he will invite fans on -
stage.
“There’s a level of trust 
there, like on some level they 
are in the band,” he said. 
“Being on stage, they could 
just as easily screw up the 
show.” 
Gillis’ interactivity with 
the crowds he plays to and his 
commitment to responding 
to fans leads some audience 
members to form a sense of 
friendship with the artist.
“It’s not like there is some 
creepy pseudo-friendship go -
ing on,” he said. “But some 
people definitely feel a connec -
tion.”Girl Talk spins samples, shows

It’s a small world, boys 
and girls, and there’s 
no chance you’ll be able to get 
away with fooling around with 
more than one person ““Tim Altmeyer, director of “Glen -
garry Glen Ross,” said his play 
includes a great deal of lively dis -
cussion.
“If you love a good swear word, 
then come,” he said.
Students may have heard of the 
1992 Oscar-nominated film of the 
same name, which featured an all-
star cast, including Al Pacino and 
Kevin Spacey. 
The film is also 
based on the 
1982 play by 
David Mamet.
The play, 
hosted by the 
UF School of 
Theatre, will be 
performed at the McGuire Pavil -
ion Constans Theatre starting Fri -
day and ending March 6. Student 
tickets cost $9. 
Altmeyer described it as “a 
story about the underbelly of the 
American dream.”
Young people go to college so 
they can learn to make money.
“This play explores what it 
means to be driven by money,” he 
said.
The characters in the play, a 
group of ambitious real estate 
salesmen, are faced with two 
choices: make it big, whatever it 
takes, or get stepped on. 
“There’s a thin line between 
good business practices and 
fraud,” Altmeyer said.
In Mamet’s original play, the 
characters are middle-aged. Alt -
meyer made some adjustments – this time, all the characters are 
in their early twenties. “By filling 
the play with young people, I was 
hoping the students would see 
themselves reflected in the charac -
ters,” he said.
References to the 1980s have all 
been cut from the script. Technol -
ogy has been updated to include 
iPhones  and the soundtrack in -
cludes songs by 
50 Cent and Lil 
Wayne.
A l t m e y e r 
also added a 
woman into the 
originally all-
male cast. 
“The kind of 
girl they’d normally pick up in a 
bar now has power over them,” he 
said.
One of the main characters 
is Richard Roma, the top-selling 
agent. Christopher Fahmie, who 
plays Roma, described him as a 
“take-the-jacket-off-your-back kin -
da guy – suave, fast-talking, and 
sleazy.”
He described the play as “un -
conventional, raw and desperate.”
To highlight the relevance of 
the play, the director mentioned 
some current events, including 
the subprime mortgage crisis, En -
ron and the corporate bailout. He 
also said there’s something special 
about seeing a live event.
“The actors and audience are 
breathing the same air,” Altmeyer 
said. “You can’t get that in a movie 
theater.”HENRY TAKSIER  � AVENUE WRITER

The Gators will get good news 
on March 15. After a one-year hiatus, they’ll be back in the 
NCAA Tournament. The UF logo will flash on the television screen, and the players and coaching staff will be able to breathe a sigh of relief. Their repu-
tation as a prominent basketball pro-
gram will be back.
But they don’t deserve it.Is it because of their effort? No. 
Their effort has improved in the past 
year, and the players are taking losses 
harder than they did last season. They should be praised for that.
Is it because the Southeastern Con-
ference is as weak as it has been in years? Not entirely, no. A weak con-ference actually helps the Gators get in, and no team should be judged negatively just because its conference 
— which is normally among the elite — is having an 
off year. 
What about 
that lack of size that will surely lead to them get-ting dominated 
by bigger, stron-
ger teams in the tourney? No 
again. Plenty of shooter-heavy teams have made it far based on that ability 
alone.
It’s because they aren’t good 
enough. They’ve come close to being 
good enough — on several occasions 
— but whatever that proverbial sports 
hump is, this team can’t get over it. They can’t figure out how to take the next step, at least not as a whole. Nick Calathes is one of the best players in

UF pitcher Stacey Nelson throws a pitch during the Gators’ 3-0 win against Baylor on Feb. 6. Nelson 
threw a shutout against No. 6 Michigan on Wednesday.
� UF SCORED 4 RUNS IN THE 
FIRST TWO INNINGS.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
After taking down the No. 6 team 
in the nation, Stacey Nelson felt like 
she was just getting started.
With Nelson in the circle, the 
No. 2 UF softball team (13-2) held Michigan (12-4) scoreless on three hits while putting 4 quick runs on 
the board Wednesday afternoon in 
Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. 
Nelson (6-2) struck out nine bat-
ters on the day, but the senior ace felt like she could have kept pitch-
ing for quite some time after the fi-
nal out.
“I had an abnormal amount of 
energy before the game today, so I 
probably could have pitched four 
games,” Nelson said.
Nelson kept the Wolverines, who 
averaged nearly 4.5 runs per game before Wednesday, off the score-
board in seven innings of work, but 
the Gators removed some of the pressure from Nelson early in the game by putting runs on the board. 
Tiffany DeFelice, who entered the 
game with only one RBI this season, drove in 2 runs with two outs in the bottom of the first on a double that flew just over the shortstop’s glove 
into left field.
“It felt good because I’ve been 
struggling a little bit lately,” DeFe-
lice said. “It felt kind of good to ac-tually get my job done.”
UF coach Tim Walton said he is 
confident in the sophomore slugger to perform in the fifth spot in the or-der despite her inconsistent play at the plate early in the season.
“If we’re going to win a champi-
onship, it’s going to be with Tiffany 
DeFelice in the five hole,” Walton 
said. 
“I think that’s important for me 
to maintain that consistency.”
After DeFelice drove in the 
Gators’ first 2 runs in the first in-ning, center fielder Kim Waleszonia followed suit in the second.
Michigan replaced starting pitch-
er Nikki Nemitz (7-2) with Jordan Taylor after just 1 1/3 innings, but Waleszonia singled up the middle 
to send home 2 more runs, putting Nelson’s shutout leads to win vs. No. 6 Michigan

Anything Eastern Michigan can do, 
UF can do better.
After the Eagles launched a two-out 
grand slam off Gators starter Anthony 
DeSclafani in the third inning, UF right fielder Riley Cooper blasted one of his own to the parking lot behind left field on 
the first pitch from reliever Corey Chaf-
fins.
Cooper crushed the ball, and it didn’t 
take long for him to realize it was a home 
run.
“(I knew) as soon as I hit it,” Cooper 
said.
The grand slam from Cooper — UF’s 
first since Cole Figureoa hit one in Miami 
on March 2 last season — put the Gators up 8-4 and carried them all the way to their 17-6 victory Wednesday night at McKethan Stadium.
Things looked bleak for the No. 24 Gators (5-0) after the Eagles’ grand slam. After scoring 4 runs in the first inning and having its first five batters get hits, UF’s bats went cold. They didn’t tally a hit in 
the second, third or fourth inning.
But on a chilly night at McKethan Sta-
dium, Cooper’s shot heated the whole 
team up — UF scored 7 more runs in the sixth inning, and catcher Buddy Mun-
roe had a 3-run homer of his own. What 
looked like it could be a close game be-came a blowout very quickly.

hit just .207 and had 25 of his 58 at-bats UF BASEBALLGrand slam powers Gators

end in strikeouts, he’s performing 
much better for the team.
“He’s in the flow of the team 
a lot better,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
“This year, he’s kind of had a 
fresh start from the beginning, 
and he’s earned his way into the 
lineup earlier.”
The team had a season-high 18 
hits by the time the last out was made. The Gators are averaging 
9.4 runs and 11.8 hits per game af-
ter their first week of the year.
After having no home runs 
coming into the night, UF ended 
the evening with three.
Senior left fielder Avery Barnes 
took one out of the park in the 
first at-bat of the game. It was the Gators’ first leadoff homer since 
Gavin Dickey hit one against South 
Carolina on March 25, 2006.
O’Sullivan emptied the bench 
by the end of the night: Fifteen 
Gators had a chance at the plate.The UF pitching staff also had 
six pitchers get some experience Wednesday night.
“We got a lot of guys on the 
mound. We got a lot of guys to get 
some at-bats,” O’Sullivan said. “A lot of the youngsters got their feet 
wet.”
The most important experience 
might have gone to DeSclafani.
It took three pitches for him 
to register his first career strike-
out, but the rest of the freshman’s night wasn’t nearly as easy.
DeSclafani came out after the 
third inning having allowed 5 
earned runs. He struck out four 
and walked one in his college de-but.
Reliever Kevin Chapman (1-0, 
0.00 ERA), who pitched the fourth and fifth innings, earned the vic-tory for the Gators and got the game ball.
“He did a really, really nice job 
for us, settled things down in the middle innings,” O’Sullivan said. “That’s what you need in games like this.”DeSclafani gives up 5 earned runs, strikes out four in first college game
UF up 4-0 after two innings.
After giving up 2 quick runs, 
Taylor gave up no runs and only 
allowed one hit the rest of the 
game, but Michigan was not able to produce at the plate against Nelson. Even when the Wolver-
ines threatened to score in the 
sixth inning, the Gators took care of business in the field. 
With Michigan’s Teddi Ew-
ing in scoring position, Molly 
Bausher singled to right field, but Kelsey Bruder fired the ball in 
to catcher Kristina Hilberth, ending 
the inning and pre-serving the shutout.
“I tried to tell 
myself before that 
batter came up, ‘Don’t let them score,’ and I let them get a hit,” Nelson said. “So when your team-
mate can pick you up like that, it 
really feels good as a pitcher.”
By taking down a highly 
ranked opponent with relative ease, the Gators removed some 
of the lingering doubts about the team after it fell to No. 3 Wash-
ington on Friday in Palm Springs, 
Calif.
“After all the ups and downs 
that we faced in California, to be 
able to come out and still prove that we still can win was good,” 
Nelson said.Gators’ win restores confidence after weekend loss to No. 3 Washington
SOFT , from page 18the nation, but he plays for a team with role players who 
are asked to be starters.
“We actually were outplaying them for a good portion 
of the game,” freshman guard Erving Walker said after UF’s 81-75 loss at LSU, the most recent example of the team not having what it takes to be a tournament team.
That’s the problem. Walker’s right. The Gators did out-
play the Tigers for most of the game, and they very well could have won the game. Instead, they looked like a team that doesn’t know how to win in the last 10 minutes. 
They don’t understand how to win a “big game,” the 
game that makes Joe Schmo look up at his TV the next 
morning while scarfing down Cheerios and watching 
SportsCenter and say, “Nice win, Florida.” That hasn’t happened in almost two years now. 
I don’t know why this is, and I’m not in the locker room 
or practice facility to know the truth. What I do know, however, is that this team will make the tournament based on its reputation, and they’ll lose in the opening weekend because they aren’t deserving of that reputation.
There is always something new that it isn’t getting. 
Whether it’s defensive intensity, focus in practice or, now, what qualifies as a good shot, this team has not proven it can put the complete package together with a nice bow on top. And teams in the NCAA Tournament shouldn’t be 
given bids without proving this. 
“We’ve played at Florida State, Kentucky, Tennessee,” 
Walker said. “We’re not going to use (lack of experience) 
as an excuse.”
Walker is right again. Whether it’s a lack of experience 
or anything else, there are no more reasons for not taking the next step. 
The reality is, though, that staircase still looks pretty 
long to the Gators.BRIAN , from page 18

MARANA, Ariz. — Tiger Woods said he was 
ready to go after eight months away from golf.
Was he ever.
Woods ended his 253-day break from competi-
tion Wednesday with a spectacular start at the Ac-
centure Match Play Championship, going birdie-eagle to build a quick lead in his opening match 
against an overwhelmed Brendan Jones.
Woods poured it on late, eagling the par-5 13th 
hole to go 4 up with five holes to play. Jones had 
little chance on a day when Woods was as hot as the desert sun.
The world’s No. 1 player said he looked forward 
to the rush of competition, something he had not experienced since he won the U.S. Open in a playoff June 16 on one good leg. He had season-ending sur-
gery on his left knee a week later.
Fans packed into the bleachers around the first 
tee, with more lined up behind the ropes all the way 
to the green, and the cheer when Woods walked onto the tee could be heard all the way down the 
fairway.
Woods backed off his tee shot, and without much 
expression, belted a fairway metal down the right 
side of the fairway.
“You are back!” one spectator shouted.From 167 yards, Woods hit an 8-iron toward the 
middle of the green that caught a ridge and stopped 5 feet from the hole, which he converted for birdie to go 1 up. The par-5 second was even better, as 
Woods posed over his second shot and offered a 
gentle fist pump when he stopped 4 feet from the hole. He never had to make his eagle putt when Jones settled for par.
So much for the rust — at least early.
Woods found the bunker on the par-3 third, the 
ball on a slight downslope, leaving him no chance 
to get it close. He wound up with a bogey to halve the hole and didn’t look nearly as crisp the rest of 
the front nine.
Jones cut into the lead when Woods came up 
short of the seventh green and made birdie, then 
Woods answered with a 6-foot birdie on the eighth. He was 2 up heading to the back nine.
The gallery hustled through the desert to watch 
every shot, missing some entertain-ing golf around the rest of Dove 
Mountain.
Three days after Phil Mickelson 
blew a lead and rallied to win at Riviera, he did it again.
Lefty was 4 up with five holes 
to play when former U.S. Open 
champion Angel Cabrera won the 
next four holes — three of those with birdies — to 
force overtime. Mickelson won on the 19th hole.
Anthony Kim never lost a hole against Lin Wen-
Tang, beating him 7 and 5. Camilo Villegas had the shortest day of work at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club, hammering Rod Pampling of Australia, 7 and 6.
Trevor Immelman got off to the best start, holing 
out with a 9-iron for eagle on the opening hole. But the Masters champion wound up losing when Shin-go Katayama fired off three birdies and an eagle on the back nine, winning 3 and 2.
That was the lesson for Woods at the Match Play 
— the finish is always more important than the start.PGA TOUR

sidelines during the Bucs’ game against the New Orleans Saints in Tampa. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — Derrick Brooks, one of the top 
players in Tampa Bay history, was cut by the Buc-
caneers on Wednesday in a purge of the team’s older players.
Brooks, the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year 
when Tampa Bay won the Super Bowl after the 2002 season, was among five players cut, four of them older than 32-year-old Raheem Morris, the team’s new head coach.
The others were wide receivers Joey Galloway 
and former Gator Ike Hilliard, running back War-rick Dunn and linebacker Cato June. The 29-year-old June is the only player under 30 and the only one younger than Morris.
The releases save more than $10 million in sal-
ary cap space for a team that already is close to $50 million under the projected cap of $123 million. General manager Mark Dominik said the object of the cuts was less to save money than to get the team younger.
Of the team’s core veterans, only cornerback 
Ronde Barber survived the purge. Barber, who will turn 34 in April, worked closely with Mor-
ris, who spent time as the team’s defensive backs 
coach before rising to head coach.
But the 36-year-old Brooks was the most vis-
ible cut after a season in which he made his 11th Pro Bowl.
“There is no way to adequately thank Derrick 
Brooks for his years of dedication and service to this team and community, or for his impact on me personally,” Morris said. “He is a once-in-a-life-
time kind of player and man, and I am very fortu-
nate to have had the chance to work with him and learn from him. Those who played with him and coached him are better because of it.”
Brooks, one of only four players voted to 10 
consecutive Pro Bowls, was also a standout off the field — he was the co-winner of the 2000 NFL Man of the Year award, given to the player who combines skill on the field with good works off it.
“Our family and the entire Tampa Bay com-
munity owe Derrick an indescribable measure of gratitude for all that he has meant over the last 14 years,” said Buccaneers co-chairman Bryan Glazer. “His play on the field and leadership in the locker room helped resurrect our franchise, and we look forward to celebrating his certain enshrinement in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.”
Dunn, 34, was the Man of the Year in 2004.
He played his first five seasons with the Bucs, 
spent six years with Atlanta, then rejoined Tampa 
Bay last season, rushing for 786 yards and a 4.2 average.
He made the Pro Bowl three times and is the 
sixth player in NFL history to record over 10,000 yards rushing and 500 receptions. Dunn has played in 181 games with 154 starts and rushed for 10,967 yards, 19th best in NFL history.
Galloway, 37, is the only Buccaneer to have 
three straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards 
receiving, something he accomplished from 2005-
2007. He is only the second player to have three such seasons with two different teams — he did it in 1995 and 1997-98 with Seattle.
Brooks, Dunn, Galloway and Hilliard are all 
former first-round draft choices — Brooks and Dunn with the Bucs, Galloway with the Seahawks and Hilliard with the New York Giants in 1997.Bucs cut Brooks, four others

Derrick Brooks for his years of dedi -
cation and service to this team and 
community, or for his impact on me
