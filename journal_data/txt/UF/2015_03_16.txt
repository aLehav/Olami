All it took was a ‘2,’ and the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center erupted in screams.
The arena was ﬁ  lled with crying and yell-
ing as Dance Marathon members lifted post-
ers to reveal that the 21st annual event raised 
$2,015,307.17 in less than a year — 31 percent 
more than the roughly $1.5 million raised last year. 
According to a tweet from Zac Johnson, 
vice president of Children's Miracle Network, this makes UF the No. 2 Dance Marathon ben-eﬁ  ting the network and was the fastest to $2 million in the history of the program.
“It was incredible — there was so much 
energy,” said Melissa Dukes, public relations overall director. “Everyone was so passionate 
this year.”
Dukes, a 22-year-old public relations se-
nior, said fundraisers were crunched for time 
this year. Dance Marathon, a 26.2-hourlong event beneﬁ  ting UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, was about a month earlier than usual due to the O’Connell Center’s previous reno-
vation schedule.
Dancers stood up at 12:02 p.m. Saturday 
and didn’t sit until 2:15 p.m. Sunday. Through-
out the event, they were kept occupied with a line dance, live music and themed hours.
This was Brianna Kane’s fourth year danc-
ing, and she said she bawled when the number was revealed.
“Watching it grow each year to $2 million 
was just incredible,” the 21-year-old UF psy-chology senior said.

Students celebrate in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center on Sunday after hearing that Dance Marathon participants raised a record-
breaking $2,015,307.17 to beneﬁ  t UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. Dance Marathon at UF is an annual 26.2-hour event where hundreds of students stay awake and “stand for those who can’t” to raise money for Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.

This year, the Student Experi-
ence in the Research University sur-
vey asked UF students about their gender identities, offering more op-tions than just “male” and “female.”
Students can choose “trans 
male,” “trans female,” “gender non-conforming” or write in a response.
The idea to ask students about 
gender identity came from a study by the Williams Institute that said the best way to identify gender mi-
norities is to ask for sex assigned at 
birth as well as gender identity, said Noelle Mecoli, assistant director of analytic services for UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Institutional Planning and Research.
“As our perceptions change 
about gender, we should be more inclusive and open to people’s iden-
tities,” Mecoli said.
This is the fourth year UF has 
administered the undergraduate 
experience survey, which is distrib-uted at 15 research universities and based at the University of Califor-nia, Berkeley, according to the As-sociation of American Universities.
The survey also asked students if 
they felt others of their gender and sexual orientation were respected on campus.
Iain Randall, senior ambassador 
for UF’s LGBT Affairs, said the new questions are a fantastic step toward making the university safer and more inclusive. But he can see how students may ﬁ  nd them invasive.
“I’m very open with my orien-
tation, but I could see how some would be bothered by it,” the 
21-year-old linguistics senior said.
The questions are another step 
UF has taken to be inclusive of all 
students, Randall said.  
Mecoli said it’s important for the 
university to be asking these ques-tions so that it can better understand what students are going through.
“We want to hear the students’ 
voice,” Mecoli said.SERU asks

More than anything, Joey Xu 
loved to run. 
For a 10-year-old boy who 
could do almost anything — 
from folding origami to play-
ing the violin to building water bottle rockets — running was 
always a passion.
Even when he was undergo-
ing kidney cancer treatments 
throughout 2014, Joey's only complaint to his mother was that he couldn’t run.
On Saturday, the Joey’s 
Wings Foundation hosted Jo-ey’s Run, a 5K run and walk in 
Westside Recreation Center, to 
honor Joey's passion and raise research funds for the cancer that ended Joey's running near-ly four months ago. About 500 people, including Joey's friends, doctors and William S. Talbot Elementary classmates, ran or walked in his memory.
Joey's mother, Kathy Liu, 39, 
began organizing the event soon after her son passed away on Nov. 26 — a day before Thanks-giving — from a rare form of kidney cancer, in UF Health Shands Hospital. She said she ‘Joey’s Run’ 5K honors life of Gainesville boy

“No more fees, no more fees!” 
Diana Moreno chanted along with 
a crowd of graduate assistants Fri-day on Turlington Plaza.
The chief coordinator of Gradu-
ate Assistants United and other graduate students were rallying for the reduction of fees they owe the university every semester.
This semester’s fees were due 
Friday, and one teaching assistant held a sign that read, “Feeday the 13th.” Another student’s sign read, “What the Fuchs is up with fees?”
The crowd cheered as speakers 
voiced their opinion on UF’s grad-uate assistant fees and demanded change.
“We want for our university to understand that graduate as-sistants’ working conditions are undergraduates’ learning condi-tions,” Moreno told the crowd. “If you’re an undergraduate and you’re interested in graduate school, then this concerns you.”
Paul Ortiz, UF associate profes-
sor of history and a member of the United Faculty of Florida, said he thinks the yearly $1,400 graduate assistant fee is something that de-tracts from UF’s academic mission.
“It’s one of the things that’s 
keeping UF from reaching the next level,” said Ortiz.
He said he recalls being a grad-
uate student at Duke University, 
where he was pinching pennies 
and stocking his pantry with 10-for-$1 Ramen noodles.
“There’s a reason you wouldn’t 
associate the term ‘grad student’ 
with fun,” he said. “They’re the 
hardest working citizens at the university.”
International graduate student 
Lia Merivaki from Greece said 
the stress from fees is unbearable 
for her and her husband, who is also a graduate assistant. They are both pursuing Ph.D.s, teaching 
classes and raising their 2-year-old 
daughter.
“We make, each, $13,000 a year, 
and there’s students that make 
$25,000 to $30,000 a year that have to pay the same fees,” she said. “This is the most unfair to me. The impact is disproportionate.”
Moreno said there are now bills 
in the Florida House and Senate that address the issue of teaching assistant fees. She said the union organizes statewide.
“We know to win, we have to 
fight at every level,” Moreno said.
She said GAU’s next move will 
be trying to set up a meeting with President Kent Fuchs.
“We would love to build a rela-
tionship with him and talk to him about graduate assistant issues so that we can start working on them and solve them together,” she said.

JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH. 
MELISSA GOMEZ

A former Gator who climbed 
her way up the political ladder re-
turned to Gainesville on Friday to address the local Jewish commu-nity.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz 
spoke to students and community members about staying connected in the Jewish community and rec-ognizing the importance of Jewish American Heritage Month.
Wasserman Schultz said 
Gainesville is her second favorite place after her South Florida home-
town. She earned her bachelor’s 
and master’s degrees in political science from UF, and she was a student senator and member of the College Democrats. 
Soon after graduating, Wasser-
man Schultz became the first Jew-ish woman from Florida elected into Congress in 2004. She said she 
carries her pride in Judaism and Is-rael proudly and was influential in 
creating Jewish American Heritage Month, which is celebrated in May. 
She said it’s important for the 
UF Jewish community to get in-volved around campus. 
“I think it’s really important that 
we instill that activism,” Wasser-man Schultz said.
Wasserman Schultz also spoke 
about the honor of traveling to Is-rael with President Barack Obama as the liaison between the White House and the Jewish community. 
During the Q&A, people asked 
about combating anti-Semitism, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent speech and ad-
vice as a female leader. 
Aaron Hubberman, a UF politi-
cal science freshman, said he was 
impressed by her work ethic. 
“She’s showing (hard work) by 
climbing the political ladder,” Hub-berman, 19, said. 
Wasserman Schultz interacted 
with students and stressed what an 
important force government is in 
their lives. 
“Stay engaged, stay involved,” 
she said in her closing. “We should always continue the commitment to paying it forward.” 
organized the event because Joey's birthday and cancer diagnosis were both in March.
“We just want people to know 
about this cancer,” Liu said. “It made my heart hurt to know how little funding we have. We deserve more money.”
As the run began at 9:30 a.m., 
runners sped past hanging chains of origami cranes, some folded by Joey. Some of his artwork printed on cards and calendars was for sale with proceeds going to pediatric kidney cancer research.  
At the same time Joey’s Run be-
gan, about 200 runners in the San Francisco Bay Area — where Joey's family lived for a couple years — 
began running either a 10K or 20K 
distance over the course of two days in his honor. Liu said she never ex-pected such a large turnout, and she knew Joey would have loved it.“Joey would say ‘Oh mommy, 
this is so cool,’” Liu said. “'All these people with my name on their shirts.'”
Having donated Joey's corneas 
for transplant surgery, Liu said her family knew he was watching. 
“He’s watching and cheering,” 
she said. “He’s very proud of his friends, his school.”
Many of Joey's classmates and 
teachers from Talbot Elementary, doctors from Worthington Pediat-rics and friends from church were at the run. 
“It’s almost like you feel his en-
ergy here with all these people,” said Anna Guarino, 34, Joey's fourth-grade teacher. “I feel his spirit is alive.”
While Liu hopes to create a 
benefit concert in addition to the annual run, many of the runners couldn’t imagine a better way to re-
member Joey.
“This is the epitome of Joey,” 
April Tisher, 37, said. “This is the 
perfect way to remember him.”
As she ran with her 10-year-old 
son, Andrew, she said they joked about how Joey would have passed them by then.
Andrew, who had been in Joey's 
class at Talbot every year from kin-dergarten to fifth grade, said he never got the chance to run a race with his best friend.
“He would’ve wanted to run the 
race,” Andrew said. ”I would ask him to run one more race with me.”
But even as he ran alone, An-
drew said he knew his friend was 
running with him.4, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, MARCH 16, 2015

Graduate programs within several of UF’s 
colleges continue to be ranked among the top 
50 schools of their type in the country, ac-cording to the U.S. News & World Report of Best Graduate Schools rankings released last 
week.
The UF College of Medicine ranked No. 43 among the top 50 best-researched medi-
cal schools. It now ranks No. 17 nationally among public medical schools and is the high-est-ranked medical school in Florida.
The College of Medicine has increased its 
research funding and will unveil a new medi-cal education building in Fall 2015.
Dr. Timothy Flynn, the UF senior associate 
dean for clinical affairs, said he is proud of the work UF has done.“This ranking reflects the hard work and 
day-to-day commitment of our talented facul-ty and staff, as well as the highly qualified stu-dents we’ve been able to recruit,” Flynn said. 
In the same report, the UF College of Nurs-
ing’s master’s degree program ranked No. 48 of 246 programs.
Elle Keenan, a 22-year-old third-year accel-
erated nursing student, said the college’s stu-dents are fortunate to have UF Health, North Florida Regional Medical Center and the Vet-erans Affairs hospital in the city.
“Having the opportunity to work under 
these incredible institutions is what sets us apart from other nursing programs,” she said.
The College of Veterinary Medicine, the 
School of Physician Assistant Studies and two 
programs within the College of Public Health 
and Health Professions were also ranked among the highest in the nation. UF health graduate programs rank among nation’s best

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW ORLEANS  — The 
arrest of Robert Durst, a 
wealthy eccentric linked to two killings and his wife’s disappearance, came on Sat-
urday just before the ﬁ  nale in 
an HBO show about his life in which he said he “killed them all.”
Durst was arrested on a 
murder warrant before Sun-day evening’s ﬁ  nale of an HBO serial documentary about his links to three sensa-
tionalized killings.
In the ﬁ  nale, Durst was 
asked about similarities in 
handwriting in a letter he wrote and another linked to one of the killings. Later, ﬁ  lmmakers said Durst wore his microphone into the bath-room.
What followed was a bi-
zarre rambling in which Durst said, apparently to himself, “There it is. You’re caught” and “What the hell did I do? Killed them all of course.”
The show ended, and it 
wasn’t clear whether produc-ers confronted Durst about 
the secretly recorded words, 
or what Durst meant by them.
Durst was ordered to be 
held without bond pending another hearing Monday. 
Durst participated in the 
documentary, giving an ex-tensive interview to ﬁ  lmmak-er Andrew Jarecki for “The 
Jinx: The Life and Deaths of 
Robert Durst.”

comment about Sunday’s ﬁ  nal episode hasn’t been returned.Subject of HBO doc:

One-hundred and seventeen for-
gotten boxes sat in the back of the 
Northwest 13th Street Dunkin’ Do-nuts on Saturday morning.
Inside them was an array of 
chocolate, Boston Kreme, blueberry cake and double-chocolate cake — the products of a seven-hour Friday night bakery shift.
But the $989 order was never 
paid for or picked up.
Jeremy Cyr, area manager for 
Dunkin’ Donuts in Gainesville, woke up to 1,404 doughnuts but no customer.
“I was initially shocked,” Cyr 
said. “You gotta be kidding me.”
The customer cited Gatornation-
als when he or she made the order, Cyr said. Cyr usually takes down 
the customer’s contact and payment 
information for big orders, but this time he didn’t.
Chris Lawyer, the media rela-
tions manager for the National Hot Rod Association, which hosts Ga-tornationals, said he knew nothing about the order and that it wasn’t 
the NHRA’s.
The store held a BOGO-dozen 
deal to get rid of the surplus dough-
nuts. By 3 p.m. Saturday, about 70 dozen doughnuts remained, Cyr said.
“I’m going to carry these dough-
nuts to the dumpster, or I could take them to someone who could use 
them,” Cyr recalled saying to him-self.
So, he donated them to St. Fran-
cis House.
Because of the mystery customer, 
doughnuts were eaten for breakfast, 
lunch and dinner at the homeless 
shelter.
Milagros Oliveras, a St. Francis 
client service staff member, said 50 
dozen doughnuts were donated.

hullabaloo sign of 
partisan issues
Every presidency generates its own controversies. Abra-
ham Lincoln’s inauguration started a civil war. The Rea-gan administration illegally sold weapons to Iran and 
used the proceeds to fund a right-wing Guatemalan militia with 
a fondness for committing war crimes. Bill Clinton holds the 
unique distinction of having been the ﬁ  rst president caught get-
ting blown in the Oval Ofﬁ  ce.
Our sitting president is no stranger to political contention. 
Indeed, his presidency has been one of the most divisive in his-
tory. For various reasons, ranging from his attempt to imple-
ment a public health care option to simply being black, Barack 
Obama’s legacy will be marked by constant opposition from ﬁ  gures situated right-of-center on the political spectrum. A com-posite picture of these criticisms makes him look like a sinister, 
anti-colonial inﬁ  ltrator allied with every anti-American ideology 
imaginable.
Now, we think it’s ﬁ  ne to criticize President Obama, but the 
way things go now, he just gets criticized on the basis of his exis-
tence. This determined stance spreads to everything he touches, 
so to speak, so that the most stringent opposition to a president 
since the New Deal affects things it shouldn’t. Policies he’s in 
charge of because they’re his presidential obligations are under ﬁ  re from his detractors, even if he doesn’t execute these policies in a uniquely Obama-y way.
The latest bout of this craziness has erupted over the Reagan 
administration’s former arms customer, Iran. The U.S. is work-ing with six other countries to broker a nuclear deal with Iran, the endgame being a diplomatic solution that avoids World War III. In a rather senseless move, 47 senators signed a con-descending letter to Iran’s leaders, drafted by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arizona. The letter, in language likely lifted from a ﬁ  fth-grade civics textbook, explained the separation of powers and implied any deal made is with Obama alone, not the U.S. Perhaps they were inspired by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech to Congress earlier this month, or worried they’d miss their chance to blare Toby Keith’s latest album as they urinate on shattered Persian cultural sites. Whatever their reasons, these senators have made fools of themselves and of the U.S. in the in-ternational community. Their breach of decorum demonstrates the lengths partisan agitators will go to prove a point.
Partisan friction has been ratcheting up since his election 
more than six years ago. It’s getting to a point where the mag-netism of the tension is undeniable, so much that it seems like there’s some sort of repressed beltway sex thing fueling it all. Obama and Republicans in Congress are acting like those kids you knew in high school who openly loathed each other right up until a concoction of Four Loko and Lil Jon had them furiously making out on the couch. Unfortunately for us, this passion is screwing with important national and international events.

The reaction to the demonstrations of the Ohio-based, 
anti-abortion group, Created Equal, when it came to campus Tuesday and Wednesday was overwhelm-
ingly negative. The protesters, angry passers-by and col-umnists in this newspaper expressed their ill will toward 
the group and its demonstration. Some students claimed 
the whole demonstration was ineffective. Others thought it was tasteless.
I was a bit shocked that not a single person defended 
Created Equal. I have great disagreements with the group, its tactics and beliefs. But, at the very least, I believe that someone should offer a defense of the group and what it did.
I’ll give a list of a few defenses.  
First off, Created Equal has every right to demonstrate 
on campus. A common complaint is that Created Equal 
abused its First Amendment rights. If using the amend-ment means abusing the amendment, then clearly the group is at fault, as well as the protesters. Obviously, this rationale is ridiculous and false.
Using the First Amendment to its fullest extent means a 
group can say and display its beliefs. When beliefs are pre-sented, arguments and differences of opinion should be 
expected. What ensues is an educational moment of sorts. 
Each side in the debate learns what the other side believes.
A debate did not happen, and this wasn’t Created 
Equal’s fault. Some students — a handful, to be fair — angrily shouted at the demonstrators and a man knocked signs off a Created Equal table. Students violated the rights of Created Equal, not the other way around.
We like to think that because we are in college, we are 
open-minded and receptive to different beliefs. As was 
demonstrated, when we are presented with beliefs that are 
not popular on campus, we are not completely receptive.    
If we are being honest with ourselves, we do not want 
to have an abortion debate on campus, regardless of tac-tics. Most people stand ﬁ  rmly in either the anti-abortion or pro-abortion rights camp. Neither side wants to engage the other. Perhaps the only way to engage the other side is to use shock tactics, such as drawing a wire hanger on a Turlington Hall wall or present-ing horriﬁ  c post-abortion im-ages.
Secondly — and this pains 
and disgusts me to say — the 
horriﬁ  c tactics work. This is not a 
justiﬁ  cation, this is a fact. Those who claim otherwise are lying. If the brutal tactics of the anti-abor-tion group didn’t work, we’d 
never see them on campus. There is something completely disturbing yet emotionally powerful about the images and video on the plaza.
Finally, young people are inspired by those who act on 
their convictions. We wish we were strong enough to be-lieve in a cause despite adversity, like civil rights leaders. When it comes to groups like Created Equal, however — groups that we by and large disagree with — we demon-ize them.
How dare they come to campus and tell us what they 
believe! They can’t be acting on their own convictions because their convictions are not my convictions! If they don’t agree with me, they must be ignorant!
Created Equal believes in what it believes. The images 
displayed are results of a particular procedure. Demon-strators believe in their cause so much that they are willing to travel to multiple locations, often with intense verbal and even physical threats coming their way, in order to tell people what they are constitutionally allowed to say. Those who criticize the group deny Created Equal the right of holding its beliefs.
Once again, I am not agreeing with Created Equal, its 
tactics or beliefs. I just wish that we were honest with our-selves. 
The group had a right to demonstrate on the Plaza of 
the Americas and Turlington Plaza. I just wish that both sides, when engaged in debate, would act more civilly and less hypocritically.

The Florida Gators men’s basketball team did not receive an invite to the National Invitation Tournament, ending the team’s season.  BUDDY REED IS DAY-TO-DAY AFTER INJURY.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Buddy Reed put his body on the line in 
the series-deciding game between No. 2 
Florida and Tennessee.
Two innings after hitting a three-RBI 
triple to give the Gators a 5-1 lead on Sun-
day, the sophomore outfielder dove to grab 
a ball in right-center field — and save a potential RBI double from Tennessee’s A.J. Simcox — to end the top of the fifth inning.
The play highlighted UF’s 9-4 win over 
Tennessee to clinch the Gators’ first South-eastern Conference series of the year.
But it also ended Reed’s day.The sophomore stayed motionless in 
center field for about two minutes follow-ing the play, hunched over on his knees, be-fore walking back to the dugout under his own power with a trainer and coach Kevin O’Sullivan on either side of him.
“It was a big play in the game,” 
O’Sullivan said. “… Buddy will be day-to-day. He got an X-ray. Everything will be fine.”
Junior outfielder Harrison Bader, who 
missed three games heading into the series with a sprained ankle, opened scoring by cranking a fastball into the left-field bleach-ers for a solo home run, his team-leading seventh on the year.
“You always got to sit on a fastball,” 
Bader said. “He kind of had a quick inning and I kind of had an idea that he was going to attack the zone to get out of the inning. I just jumped on it and got a good pitch to hit.”
Bader ended the day going 2-for-3 with 
2 RBIs and scoring three runs of his own. Through 18 games played, he now has 24 RBIs on the year, which ties his career-high from 2014.
Both the Gators (18-3, 2-1 SEC) and the 
Volunteers (8-8, 1-2 SEC) added a run in the second with Tennessee getting on the board with a solo home run from Nick Senzel and Florida seeing freshman JJ Schwarz cross home plate on a passed ball.
UF tacked on four runs in the third — 
three coming from Reed’s bases-clearing triple and the fourth coming when Schwarz crossed on a wild pitch.
Two of Florida’s final three runs came on RBI doubles from Schwarz and Bader. Bader then gave the Gators their last piece of insurance one at-bat after his double in the sixth, rounding third and coming home after a wild pitch.
“I was just hustling,” Bader said. 
“You’ve got to keep your head up.”
Pitcher Danny Young — who came on 
the mound in relief for starter Dane Dun-ning — earned his first win of the season after tossing five solid innings.
The junior lefty struck out a career-high 
seven batters while giving up just three hits, two runs (one earned) and one walk.
“I felt all right,” Young said. “I haven’t 
thrown since the middle of the week any-way, so I was fresh and ready to throw as 
many innings as I could.”

LSU’s Bianka Bell knew it was gone the 
moment the ball left her bat.
With the game tied at 3, Bell crushed a 
home run to right-center field off of Lauren 
Haeger to give No. 3 LSU a 6-3 lead in the top 
of the sixth.
It was a lead the Tigers (27-1, 5-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) would not relinquish as they 
beat No. 1 Florida (28-2, 1-2 SEC) 10-3 to take two out of three in Florida’s opening SEC se-ries.
Bell dominated Florida’s pitching staff dur-
ing the three-game series, going 10-for-14 with a double, eight RBIs and 14 total bases. Bell 
went 4-for-4 in the opening game and went 3-for-5 in the final two games.     
“We saw the back of her jersey on the bases 
the whole time, she’s a good player,” coach 
Tim Walton said.
Kirsti Merritt put Florida 
ahead 3-0 in the bottom of 
the third inning when she blasted her seventh home run of the year to center field. LSU starting pitch-er Kelsee Selman settled down from then on and shut down UF as she only allowed three more Gators 
to reach base the rest of the game.
“She just pitched a great game,” Merritt 
said. “She was hitting her spots, she was get-ting us to chase a little bit which we knew she was going to try to do. She just executed very well.”
Aleshia Ocasio earned the start for Florida 
one day after allowing a go-ahead grand slam to LSU’s Kellsi Kloss. Ocasio allowed eight hits and five runs, three of them earned, as she 
picked up her second loss of the season.   
“She pitched great. … I felt like she gave us 
the best chance to win this weekend,” Walton 
said. “We make a couple better pitches and you know, who knows, the outcome could be a little bit different.”
Haeger came on in relief of Ocasio in the 
sixth inning. Haeger didn’t make a single start during the three-game set against the Tigers, 
instead coming on in relief in each game.
Haeger was brought into the game to face 
Bell after she was able to get her out in the sec-ond game of the series. Bell would get the best 
of her this time around as she hit the go ahead home run.
As a whole, UF’s pitching staff came into 
the series with a 0.76 ERA and had only al-lowed 28 runs, 18 of them earned, through 27 
games. In the three games against LSU, Flor-
ida’s staff allowed 27 runs, 19 of them being earned.
After losing two consecutive games follow-
ing a 28-0 start to the season, Walton said the team has to keep a level head and the upper-classmen will need to pick it up.
“We’re not going to overreact,” Walton 
said. “We’ve got a veteran team, we got some 
young kids in there, but we’ve got a veteran 
group on the back end that’s going to have to do a little bit better.”Florida undefeated no more after consecutive losses to LSU

Cynthia Davis, a 51-year-old 
Tarpon Springs resident, has missed 
only two Gatornationals since 1986. 
She said it’s not long before new-
comers get hooked on the barrage of 
activity.
“It’s just the aura of feeling,” she 
said. “You just gotta feel it.”
All five senses are engaged at the 
four-day Gatornationals, one of the 
largest stops in the Mello Yello Drag 
Racing Series.
The thunderous sound of drag-
sters permeates the parking lot.
The smell of nitromethane greets 
fans at the entrance, and a tingle 
forms in their eyes and throats.
They can wash down their cot-
ton candy with a soda while watch-ing cars barrel down a quarter-mile 
racetrack at hundreds of miles an 
hour in a matter of seconds.
But J.R. Todd, a 33-year-old Top 
Fuel driver, said his passion for drag racing goes beyond the action. 
He appreciates the sport’s strong 
diversity.
Todd became the first African-
American to win a National Hot 
Rod Association Top Fuel race in 
2006, according to an NHRA report.
His victories expanded beyond 
borders in 2011 after competing in the Arabian Drag Racing League at Qatar Racing Club.
He said drag racing fans are 
found beyond Gainesville’s Auto-Plus Raceway, including places like Finland and Australia.
Villy Bobic, 30, browsed racing 
merchandise on Saturday during his vacation.
He sported a racing tattoo on his 
right leg, depicting an orange, red and blue dragster. He said it’s an ex-act replica of the 1,100 horsepower car he races in Sweden.
Adjacent to the merchandise, 
rows of pit crews deconstructed and rebuilt their racecars before starting them about 5 feet from spectators.
Some of the crowd had thin lines 
of black tire dust across their faces, referred to as “Goodyear freckles” by Senior Marketing Manager Al Rondon of Coca-Cola North Amer-ica.
The Force family signed auto-
graphs in their hospitality tent next to the John Force Racing team’s RVs.
Ashley Force became the first fe-
male driver to win in the Funny Car 
division after beating her father in 
2008, and Courtney Force became the 100th female victor in the NHRA during 2014, according to the report.
Erica Enders became an icon in 
the NHRA after becoming the first female to win a Pro Stock race. 
The Disney movie ‘Right on 
Track’ is based on the experience of 
Enders and her sister in the male-
dominated sport of drag racing. 
Enders said females are more 
marketable to sponsors and fans, but sometimes they face old-fash-ioned chauvinists.
Enders remembers crying in her 
rental car after certain races and call-ing her husband or father for sup-
port. 
But rather than dwelling on the 
valleys she’s braved, she focuses on 
the peaks.
Diversity is great, she said, but 
the car doesn’t know your gender or ethnicity, and racers only have one focus on the track: their passion for racing.
“The late nights driving a pickup 
truck with an open trailer and a car to the racetrack, with a 5 gallon pail of gasoline, those stories are what make what we do now so cool,” she said, “because we all started from the bottom.”MONDAY, MARCH 16, 2015  ALLIGATOR, 15

GATORNATIONALS
Gatornationals continues strong tradition of racing  
LUIS TORRES
Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
Larry Dixon should thank the equipment in 
his dragster for saving his life.
Dixon was involved in a scary crash during 
the third round of qualifying of the National Hot 
Rod Association Gatornationals Top Fuel event 
on Saturday.
During his run, his dragster buckled in the 
center while going about 285 miles per hour. 
The dragster exploded and came apart, send-
ing Dixon’s dragster into the air.
Dixon twisted and landed 
right side up as he hit the wall.
The Auto Plus Raceway in 
Gainesville went completely 
quiet.
The look of concern on the 
faces of spectators and in the 
voice of the announcer calling the race told the entire story of the situation.
A sense of relief came over everyone when 
Dixon was shown on the jumbotron, alert and conscious, while talking with the medical staff 
checking up on him down the track.
“What I tell people, it’d be like going to Dis-
neyland. … It’d be like being on a roller coaster 
and you go off and fly off the track,” Dixon said. “Just got to wait to land and hope everything is doing its job for you.
“My car is a mess, but I’m here.”The slightest mistake made with a car with 
7,000 horsepower and reaches speeds of more 
than 300 miles per hour can be costly. 
Dixon and his crew had no early indication 
if there was something wrong with his dragster 
before the race.  “I mean, when I got out, I almost expected 
to see something wrong with the back half that caused it to do what it did,” Dixon said. “And 
when I got out of the car and looked at it, every-
thing’s there.”
Dixon was able to walk out his dragster un-
der his own power being accompanied by medi-cal personnel, something he wasn’t able to do 15 years ago.
In Memphis in 2000, he wasn’t able to walk 
off the track after a crash. Instead he was airlifted to the hospital after suffering a broken leg and 
having one of his eyes come out of its socket.
“All the improvements in the car in the 15 
years since I last did this,” Dixon said, “it’s made 
a difference.”
After the accident in Memphis, Dixon or-
dered a HANS device (Head and Neck Support device) to provide more safety for him. Dixon was the first person wearing the HANS device full time on the track. It would take another six or seven years before the NHRA would man-
date all drivers wear the device.
“You learn from all these incidents and you 
try to make things safer, so you can go through 
stuff like that and be OK,” Dixon said. “Whether we race tomorrow or not, that’s one thing, but I’m here talking to you. Last time it wasn’t an option.”  
After walking away from his crash in 
Gainesville, Dixon was asked if he feared for his life at any point in time. His response was “no.”
“I don’t know that you can explain it unless 
you do it, but I feel invincible in that racecar,” Dixon said. “Driving to the track, I’m more fear-ful for my life that I am in that car. That car’s de-signed to go through that.
“No, man. You don’t fear. You’re just count-
ing on your equipment to do the job for you.”Racer OK after horrific crash

 JOHN FORCE HAS WON 
16 FUNNY CAR TITLES IN HIS CAREER. GRAHAM HACK
Alligator Writer @graham_hack24
The smell of burnt rubber.
The scream of the engines.The blur of 7,000 horsepower.For Gainesville, Gatornationals is 
the only time each year to experience 
these sights and sounds of drag rac-
ing’s elite.
But for the Forces — the epitome of 
the sport’s elite — it’s just another fam-ily weekend.
John Force is a National Hot Rod 
Association legend, winning 16 Funny Car titles during his illustrious career, including last year’s championship.
But his race team, John Force Racing, 
also fields cars for two of his daughters 
— Brittany and Courtney Force.
“It’s fun,” John said. “When they 
were growing up, I always joked 
NHRA took me away from my kids, and now they’re out here with me and all my grandkids. Yeah, life’s good.”
In the last two seasons, both daugh-
ters have proved they belong among the sport’s best.
Brittany drives in the NHRA Top 
Fuel series, and after making her debut in 2013, she recorded four runner-up finishes in 2014.
Courtney races in the Funny Car 
series along with her father. She made her debut in 2012 and has seven career 
wins, including four last season.
For both daughters, the choice to race came at different times in life.
At the age of 7, Courtney knew rac-
ing was what she wanted to do for a 
living.
“I was out here in diapers,” she said. 
“I loved getting dirty and I was covered 
in grease and dirt half the time.
“Being in the winner’s circle cele-
brating, it was just a lot of fun so I knew 
at a young age that that was exactly what I wanted to do — I knew I wanted to drive a Funny Car just like my dad.”
Brittany didn’t decide she wanted 
to race until she was 16, but she never thought she would make a career out 
of it. Instead, she planned on being a 
teacher and only participated in racing on the side.
But after getting the opportunity to 
make some runs in a Top Fuel car, her career in education took a backseat.
“After I made my first full pass, I 
changed my mind,” she said. “I knew (racing) was the direction I was going.”
Now, the family is out racing to-
gether every NHRA weekend. While most drivers and team members are forced to be away from their families, the Forces can’t get away from each other.
“Too much time,” Brittany said jok-
ingly about how much time the family spends together. “We work together, 
we always book our travel together - I 
mean, this weekend it was my dad sit-ting between Courtney and I on a flight out here. We don’t ever get a break.”
But all kidding aside, she said she 
wouldn’t have it any other way.
“We’ve always been a very close 
family,” Brittany said. “We’re very blessed for that.”Force family races together16, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, MARCH 16, 2015
TRACK AND FIELD
KYLE BRUTMAN
Alligator Writer @KBrut13
A mixture of great highs and 
lows defined the Florida track and 
field team’s weekend at the NCAA Indoor Championship. 
Unfortunately, the latter was of 
greater importance than the for-mer.
UF’s men’s team finished in 
second place by scoring 50 points, while the women’s team ended the two-day national championship meet in fourth.Going into the final two men’s 
events of the evening — the 3000-meter run and the 4x400- me-ter relay — the top-ranked Gators were in a deadlock with No. 2 ranked Oregon at 50 points apiece.
Entering the 3000 with five of 
the 16 runners in the field, Oregon ran away with the NCAA indoor title following a top-three sweep for the Ducks — landing them 24 points and clinching a second-con-secutive national indoor title.
Oregon dealt the final blow 
to coach Mike Holloway and the Gators, and there was nothing that Holloway could do about it.
For Holloway’s squad, this was 
a precedent that some did not see coming on that day.
“I think in some instances we 
thought people were going to lay down for us and it didn’t happen,” Holloway said in a release.
Despite the last-second blow to 
the Gators’ championship hopes, there was plenty of individual suc-cess to help mend the wounds that the Ducks inflicted upon Florida—winning five individual national titles, all of which set UF records.
Senior jumper Marquis Dendy 
earned two national titles with a sweep of the long jump and triple jump.
Dendy’s winning performance 
of 8.28 meters in Friday’s long jump matched that of his national title-winning performance in the 2013 indoors — which also took place at Fayetteville’s Randal Ty-son Track Center.
The triple jump is where the 
Delaware native shined the most during his final collegiate indoor national meet. 
In the triple jump, Dendy re-
corded a distance of 17.57 meters -- leapfrogging two decorated Olym-pians in Will Claye and Christian Taylor on Florida’s all-time list to 
capture the event crown and the 
new program record.
Dendy’s triple jump mark was 
also the longest in the meet’s his-
tory — surpassing Claye’s 2011 performance — and third-best in collegiate history.
