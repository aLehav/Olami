Campaign promotes helmets
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The helmet sat under her
scooter seat, but Ashley Groves
decided not to wear it.
She didn't know that a short
scooter ride would end in an
accident, a coma and head in-
juries that could have left her
dead or disabled.
Groves, a senior health edu-
cation major, is fully recovered
from her November 2007 acci-
dent. She shared her story with
a crowd of about 100 Thursday
night at the Reitz Union Am-
phitheatre during the kickoff
event for the Scooter-Helmet
Awareness Campaign.
The weeklong campaign,
sponsored by health educa-
tion student organization Eta
Sigma Beta, seeks to encourage
students to wear their bicycle
and scooter helmets, as well as
educate students about scooter
laws.
During the event, local
group The Chris McCarty
Band performed. Student Body
President Jordan Johnson and
UF President Bernie Machen's
wife, Chris, also spoke. The
Dazzlers, Albert and Alberta
also stopped by.
Machen walked up to the
stage doing the Gator chomp
as the Gator Marching Band
played. She carried an orange
and blue scooter helmet with
the word Gator on it.
"This is my husband's hel-
met," Machen said. "He never Rayiaz Khan / Alligator Staff

Local band to perform for Jimmy Fallon
By ANNIE BOGGS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local band The Ettes will make an ap-
pearance on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"
tonight.
The punk-rock trio recently celebrated
the release of its third album, "Do You Want
Power?" on Sept. 29 and are on a month-
long national tour with fellow artist Juliette
Lewis, which kicked off on Sept. 17 in Bos-ton.
The band includes former UF students
Coco Hames on vocals and guitar, Jem Co-
hen on bass and Poni Silver
National on drums.
News "I left when I was a ju-
nior and have been taking
correspondence via the [Di-
vision of Continuing Education] when I can.
I'm close," Hames said of graduating from
UF. Though the band started in L.A., theynow live mostly on the road, with frequent
stops in London, Berlin, North Carolina and
Nashville.
Schooling has been put on hold for their
music career. The Ettes recently finished
a tour with the Grammy award-wining
band Kings of Leon and have also toured
with the Black Keys and the Detroit Cobras.

rage legend Greg Cartwright, sets of a new

'Texts From
Last Night'
TV show
By ASHLEY HORN
Alligator Contributing Writer
"Remember that text you
shouldn't have sent last night? We
do."
This tagline belongs to the popu-
lar student Web site Texts From Last
Night, where students share embar-
rassing text messages from the night
before.
"We seem to have a fascina-
tion with the private details
of celebrity lives."
Don Kershaw
UF junior
Students may soon find their re-
grettable scenarios aired on national
TV because Fox Network adopted
this for a new show.
Fox announced the sitcom's
launch Sept. 9.
"We seem to have a fascination
with the private details of celebrity
lives," said Don Kershaw, UF his-
tory junior. "So I guess it was only a
matter of time before that fascination
bled over to the general public."
The Web site, which launched in
February, boasts nearly four million
hits a day. Visitors have a chance to
rate each text as a "good" or "bad"
night, illustrated by the thumbs-up
or thumbs-down icon.
Kershaw has never used the site
and thinks it's a sad example of the
country's nosy attitude.
Steve Holland, the writer of the
new comedy, will use fictional,
20-something characters for the real-
ity show. It will highlight racy com-

STUDENT LIFE
UF entrepreneur cleans up as maidt
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
Chris Stephens, a UF electrical engineering senior, polishes a
floor during a house cleanup for Student Maid Inc. Thursday.By MOLLY LARMIE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Kristen Hadeed start-
ed cleaning houses two years
ago, it was a way to earn a little
extra money on the side.
Her clientele grew, and oth-
er students began asking her
if they could earn a little extra
money on the side, too.
In the spring of 2009, Ha-
deed, 21, a UF finance senior,
said she enrolled in an entre-
preneurship class, where she
began thinking seriously about
expanding her cleaning circuit
into an incorporated business.
In late July, Paradigm Prop-
erties, a company that owns
24 apartment complexes in
Gainesville, offered Hadeed a
contract. They needed a busi-
ness to help with clearings dur-
ing turnover, the period of time
in between residents.
With a $3,000 investment,
Hadeed incorporated her busi-
ness, Student Maid Inc., and
coordinated the cleaning of six
Paradigm complexes.
Her small-scale cleaning
operation ballooned from eight
students to 60 licensed and
insured employees protected
with workers' compensation.
Hadeed works from home
and estimates she puts in more
than 80 hours a week.
Student Maid Inc. headlinesin residential and commercial
cleaning, but employees can
also be hired to assist clients
with party preparation and
cleanup, Hadeed said.
Hadeed said the company's
Web site, studentmaid.com,
will soon allow potential clients
to type in basic information
about the service they require
and receive a quick estimate of
the cost.
Chris Stephens, a 21-year-
old UF electrical engineering
senior, began working for Ha-
deed over the summer and now
cleans four to six hours a week.
"The good thing about the
job is that Kristen understands
if I have a big test or a project
due," he said. "She knows how
it is to be a student, and she lets
me work around my sched-
ule."
Student Maid employs more
than 45 UF and Santa Fe Col-
lege students, and Hadeed is
hiring more employees to fill
the demands from her clients.
Hadeed plans to expand
her business after she gradu-
ates in the spring. She hopes to
franchise Student Maid Inc. in
other college towns throughout
Florida.
"You don't have to be a ge-
nius or a millionaire to start
a business," she said. "If you
have a good idea, anything is
possible.", 11

Local poet's book success helps her fight poverty
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Marcee Winthrop just wants to
smile again.
But Winthrop's constant struggle
against poverty has changed nearly
every aspect of her life, including
her smile.
"I used to smile so much people
called me 'Smiley,"' Winthrop said
as one of her last remaining teeth
wiggled from the inside of her
mouth like an autumn leaf waiting
to fall from a branch. "I used to have
a beautiful smile."
Dressed in a vibrantly colored
floral-print blouse, Winthrop, 54,
said she's lived in poverty for two
decades following a string of poorly
selected husbands and an inability to
find a job, a problem that Winthrop
said stems from her appearance.
But that's all about to change.
Winthrop published "Poverty
Revolution Part One: Skimming the
Surface" in May as part of her New
Year's Resolution to her daughter,
Maralisa, to get out of poverty be-
fore the end of the year.
Since its publication, the book has
sold more than 50 copies at about
$20 a piece, and Winthrop said she's
on her way to keeping her promise
to her daughter.
"We can see the light at the end of
the tunnel," Winthrop said. "We're
just not there yet."
As a result of her first book's suc-
cess, Winthrop plans to write at least
five more in a "Poverty Revolution"
series.
The second of the series, "Pov-
erty Revolution Part Two: In The---a-l --e 5atuf --11.

"This one's going to have what realities of poverty.
I call 'the classic bag [lady] blues,"' "Book One puts food on our ta-bles, pays our rent, keeps the electric
on and there's not much left after
that," Winthrop, who is adamantly
opposed to entering the "Band-Aid
cycle" of Welfare, said. "I think we
may just get over the edge, we might
just hit middle class," she added
about "Part Two."
Winthrop said she began writ-
ing for her second book, which willinclude about 12 poems and com-
mentaries, last week and has written
three poems already.
"I want the books to be short so
people will actually read them," she
said.
Winthrop, whose 14-year-old
daughter is president of her fan club,
said that the majority of her fans are
UF students, especially those who
have heard her presentations.
"When I see people react posi-
tively to the books, it gives me en-
couragement to keep on writing
these books and to get myself out of
this mess," Winthrop said.
Her daughter has noticed a few
changes since "Part One" was pub-
lished, as well.
"She's a big role model for me
now," Maralisa said. "Some people
pick Hannah Montana or The Jonas
Brothers. I pick my mom."
Perhaps the biggest change for
Winthrop since the publishing of
her first book was an offer from a
local dentist to remove her nine re-
maining teeth for free, a procedure
that would normally cost close to
$2,000, according to Winthrop.
The dentist promised to then
work out a payment plan with Win-
throp to be fitted for dentures, which
she hopes "Part Two" will be able to
pay for.
"She's in the process of metamor-
phosis," Maralisa said. "She's turn-
ing into a beautiful butterfly."
Winthrop will be a panelist for a
Poverty Housing Discussion Panel
in UF's Marston Science Library on
Thursday from 6:30 to 9 p.m., and a
book signing will be held at Goer-
ings Bookstore on Oct. 25 at 2 p.m.
Experts suggest simple steps to combat big bills
* SET THERMOSTATS TO 78
DEGREES UNTIL WINTER.
By KATHERINE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
Now that the first electricity bill
of the new leasing year has made its
way to the mailboxes, students are
scrambling to figure how to lower
utilitycosts. Mostpeopleknowabout
using fluorescent light bulbs and not
leaving windows open while the air
is running, but some tips go beyond
the obvious energy-saving strategies
to keep bills at bay.
Heating & Air Conditioning
Gainesville residents should
have their thermostats set to 78
degrees in summer months and
68 degrees during the winter, said
Kik Koppitch, Gainesville Regional
Utilities senior account manager.
Each degree of increase during the
winter and decrease in the summer
can result in a 4 percent increase in a
monthly bill.
For a typical resident who uses
about 1,000 kilowatt-hours per
month, the deviation from the rec-
ommended temperatures can result
in a $4 to $5 increase per degree, Ko-
ppitch said.
To keep the cost from fluctuat-
ing, he recommends the use of ceil-
ing fans instead of reaching for thethermostat first.
Although fans don't actually cool
the air, Koppitch said when the air
from the fan hits your skin it gives
the impression that it is between 2 to
4 degrees cooler in the room. If you
like the temperature at 75 degrees
in your home, you can have the fan
running and still be able to turn the
thermostat up to the recommended
78 degrees.
"It will still feel like it's 75 de-
grees in the room when the fan is
on," he said.
Hot Water Heater
According to Anna Prizzia, direc-
tor of the UF Office of Sustainability,
hot water heaters are the second big-
gest energy hog in houses and apart-
ments. Prizzia said although stu-
dents have little to no control over
when landlords replace the appli-
ance, they can be proactive in reduc-
ing the amount of energy it uses.
First, Prizzia said she recom-
mends that students buy an insulat-
ing blanket for the heater, available
at local hardware stores for about
$20. The blanket can remain on the
heater year round, reducing the
amount of heat lost by the appliance.
This allows it to work more efficient-
ly and use less energy.
Also, Prizzia said that if you are
going out of town for a few days
or more, you should switch your
hot water heater setting to vacationmode to reduce the amount of en-
ergy spent heating water that will
not be used.
Water-saving Tips
Watching water usage can save
on power bills too. Prizzia said
that laundry or dishes should only
be done if the appliances have full
loads. This can save up to 1,100 gal-
lons of water each month. If you
time your showers to keep them un-
der five minutes, you could save up
to 1,000 gallons of water per month,
which will drastically reduce energy
usage by using less hot watter.
Electronics
Even when their switches are
turned off, many electronic devices
are still using energy when plugged
in. Prizzia said she suggests buying
a power strip with multiple outlets
for items such as televisions, lamps
and computers.
The items are then controlled
by one switch on the strip, which
makes it easer to turn everything
off at the same time. Prizzia said the
power strips cost between $5 to $10
and can be found at any local hard-
ware store.
Instead of going to Lowe's or
Home Depot, Prizzia said she likes
to shop at local hardware stores like
Zell's Ace Hardware, located at 3727
W University Ave.
"Putting money into local econo-
my is a great way to be sustainableas well," she said.
If you don't want to spend mon-
ey, however, Prizzia recommends
unplugging items such as coffee
pots and printers that are used infre-
quently.
"You can save up to $100 a year if
you shut your electronics off by us-
ing a switch on the wall or unplug-
ging them," she said.
Refrigerator & Freezer
Having a good seal on your
refrigerator and freezer is key to
conserving energy in the kitchen.
Koppitch said that letting the least
amount of cold air out of the appli-
ance will minimize how long and
how hard its compressor will work
Energy-Savng
>Set thermostats to 78 degrees
and 68 degrees during the winto replace that cold air to make sure
the door seals are up to par, place a
dollar bill in the door while closing
it. If the appliance does not hold the
dollar firmly, the seal needs to be re-
placed.
Also, Prizzia said the more items
you have in your refrigerator and
freezer, the less the appliance will
work to make the temperature cool-
er.
"If there are already cold things
in the freezer, it will not use as much
energy to pump cold air," she said.
Prizzia recommends filling up a
water jug and putting it in the freez-
er. It will turn to ice and help keep
the temperature down.

One year ago, Miko Sy was
working at a Big Four account-
ing firm, raking in $65,000 a year
and enjoying extravagant business
trips on his boss's tab.
Now Sy, 27, is standing in the
heart of Turlington Plaza, spitting
out rhymes about love, God and
his commitment and struggles
with his faith.
"I took a $50,000 pay cut," he
said. "People thought I was crazy.
They said, 'What are you doing?
You're giving up such a comfort-
able lifestyle."'
But Sy promises he's not crazy.
After gaining campus infamy
as a rapping missionary, the only
thing he thinks is crazy is the
overwhelming response he has re-ship of Catholic University Stu-
dents, Sy raps every Thursday on
Turlington Plaza.
"This is very exciting," Sy said.
"I'm very passionate about my
music, and I'm just trying to get it
out there. I just love entertaining
people."
Sy has been entertaining the
masses since he was a child.
"I was 5 years old and, I was
already rapping," Sy said. "I just
feed off the energy of performing
in front of people."
Born in the Philippines but
raised in Chicago, Sy would per-
form his rendition of Michael
Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and
"The Super Bowl Shuffle" at fam-
ily parties.

That was about to change
When Sy was 15, he attended
a Catholic retreat, with the sole
intention of impressing a girl.
Sy likes to think God had other
plans.
"It was just this beautiful, ful-
filling message," Sy said. "I hadWhile Sy embraced his new-
found faith, he hadn't thought to
combine it with his passion for
music. Influenced by hip-hop art-
ists such as The Notorious B.I.G.
and Nas, he noticed something
was missing.
"Their musical styles inspired
me, but eventually over time, their
message just didn't resonate," he
said.
He also was having difficulty
relating to the hip-hop scene.
"I used to do battle raps," Sy
said. "I wasn't passionate about
it because I wasn't passionate
about putting other people down.
I didn't walk away feeling victori-
ous. I just felt bad."
The marriage of his two pas-
sions quickly became his trade-ing
"I don't rap about the cheesy
messages people sometimes asso-
ciate with Christianity," Sy said.
"I actually rap about my struggles
with faith. I write about the joys,
the struggles and the tears."
The tears aren't just his.
"When I perform, some people
cry tears of joy because a message
just really hits them," he said.
"People come up to me and say
that was the first time that they
ever heard the Gospel that way."
For now, Sy isn't hung up on
record deals and has no plans to
go back to his job as a CPA.
"Hip-hop is such a great way to
connect to people," Sy said. "It's
the one genre that can really reach
the masses. I felt it was a door God
put in my path."
UF students provide company for hospital-bound teens
Streetlight volunteers bring video games, magazines
By ANNA QUINTANA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Decorated tiles hang on the ceiling of the
fourth floor of Shands at UF Children's Hos-
pital, adding color and life to a usually dreary
hospital hallway.
Many teenagers with chronic illnesses are
stuck in hospital rooms every day with no one
to talk to.
That is where Streetlight comes in, a non-
profit organization that revolves around peer
support groups for adolescents with chronic
illnesses.
"Being a teenager is difficult enough," said
Rebecca Brown, the director of Streetlight.
"Add a chronic illness and it's really a tough
time."Brown said teenagers are beginning to de-
velop their identities and starting to plan their
futures.
"When diagnosed with a chronic illness,
everything of value is stripped away," she
said.
The 60 volunteers of Streetlight spend time
each week with teenagers who suffer from
cancer, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and
other life threatening illnesses.
"Just talking to them makes a difference,"
said Deevee Sanchez, a volunteer for Street-
light.
Fariza Alendy, also a volunteer, agrees.
"They have a lot to teach you about life,"
she said. "With Streetlight, you get to a pure
level with the patients.
"It has made me a better person and givenme perspective about life as a whole. I will al-
ways have that when I look back at this experi-
ence.",
With Streetlight, patients are able to get
movies, magazines, video games and board
games to pass the time as well as spend time
in the teen lounge with others their own age.
Streetlight relies on donations from outside
sources to provide theses activi-
Local ties for patients in the hospital.
News However, it is sometimes
difficult for patients to open up
to volunteers.
"These aren't children," Brown said. "It
takes more than crayons and toys for them to
talk to you. Many of these teens feel they are
self-sufficient and do not need anything else."
Sanchez agreed, but said eventually manydo open up and build bonds with the volun-
teers.
"They surprise you every day," Sanchez
said. "They are in their hospital beds writing
music, writing poetry or forming organiza-
tions to raise awareness."
It is also extremely difficult when patients
pass away.
"I have to try to make sure that volunteers
do not cross the line, getting too attached to
patients," Brown said. "You make friends and
you lose them; it can be really hard."
Brown hopes one day Streetlight will be
available in more hospitals around the coun-
try.
"Not very many hospitals have organiza-
tions like this, working strictly with adoles-
cents, and I feel it is very important," she said.
"A patient has more than medical needs as an
adolescent, and Streetlight addresses those
needs."

6, ALLIGATOR U FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2,2009
In case you've been sequestered in your house with a case
of the swine flu (or "bacon fever" as we like to call it), it's
gotten noticeably cooler outside, not to mention noticeably
quieter.
It seems like cool air and a peaceful campus have waxed
while the sun and those Student Government campaigners
have finally waned. In honor of these recent developments,
we're delighted to present you with this week's our-walks-
to-class-have-finally-stopped-resembling-our-own-personal-
version-of-The-Trail-of-Tears edition of.
Darts & Laurels
However, we'll miss telling Unite Party volunteers we work
for the Alligator. Quickest way to end a conversation, ever.
If you haven't already seen the YouTube video of a Danish
woman looking for the father of her child, don't bother. Danish
newspaper Ekstra Bladet has discovered the video was a hoax
by Denmark's tourism agency, VisitDenmark. Apparently the
agency thought the promise of beautiful blond women will-
ing to have one-night stands with anonymous foreign tourists
would bring more foot traffic to its country.
For belittling the plight of single mothers, not to mention
for almost tricking us into auditing a Danish language class,
we'd like to throw a what's-next-telling-us-that-"Temptation-
Island"-was-a-sham-elaborately-planned-by-producers-for-
ratings DART at VisitDenmark.
We'd also like to use this as an opportunity to throw a DART
at our parents for letting us watch that show in sixth grade. Just
because it came on right after "Survivor" didn't make it OK.
A mother in Michigan is being threatened with jail time if
she doesn't stop watching her neighbors' children before their
school bus arrives. According to the Michigan Department of
Human Services, Lisa Snyder is violating the law for holding
an "unlicensed day care service."
For punishing a good Samaritan, we'd like to throw a last-
time-we-checked-making-Pizza-Rolls-for-a-bunch-of-7-year-
olds-wasn't-a-crime DART at Michigan for its ridiculous,
overly broad law.
On the other hand, a woman in Iowa City has finally been
brought to justice. Elizabeth M. Weiss, of Iowa City, rented
"Biohunter," "The Devil's Advocate" and "U-Turn" in 1998
and never returned the tapes. She is now being charged $231.97
for the value of the movies and late fees.
For thinking an Oliver Stone movie was worth $77.32, we'd
like to throw a not-even-"Midnight-Express?"-really? DART at
the past-due woman who apparently doesn't know that VHS
tapes cost, like, free now.
Ten-year-old Zoe Pemberton of Essex listed her grandmoth-
er on eBay, but the listing was taken down due to the site's
policy on human trafficking. For describing her grandma as
"annoying and moaning a lot," we'd like to throw an if-only-
mechanics-could-be-this-honest LAUREL at the fully disclos-
ing granddaughter.
If you thought the "birther" movement was dead, you
thought wrong. Liveprayer.com is currently running a 28-min-
ute infomercial in several southern states that demands Barack
Obama produce his birth certificate. For proving how ridicu-
lous the movement is, we'd like to present a we-didn't-know-
you-could-make-a-film-that-looks-like-it-was-made-in-MS-
Paint LAUREL to Liveprayer.com.
For a $30 donation, you too can have your very own "Got a
Birth Certificate?" bumper sticker.
Everyone knows moving targets are worth extra points.
As a closing note, we'd like to throw a huge DART at the
Student Body for not getting out to vote. We're not surprised,
but we're pretty disappointed.
Thanks all for this week. Stay sane, and go Gators!

Letter supported ignorance
I wholeheartedly agree with Michelle Is-
gut. The Alligator shouldn't report the facts
in the public record.
What business is it of ours if the people
running for an office that controls millions
of our dollars happen to be convicted crimi-
nals? Who cares if these same people who
claim to represent our best interests get ine-
briated and decide to drive around town,
possibly mowing down their constituents
along the way?
Instead, the Alligator should be support-
ing these people, some of whom have been
convicted of the same crime multiple times
because it is clear they are turning their lives
around. I find it refreshing that someone
is willing to stand up and demand that we
remain ignorant of pertinent factors in de-
ciding who should represent us in Student
Government.
So, good for you, Michelle Isgut, of the
Gator Party, for demanding that a newspa-
per stop reporting the truth, good for you.

SG controversy triggers deja vu
While I was reading the letters to the edi-
tor today, I read the article about the Unite
Party members who were stealing all of the
newspapers from the Graham area on Tues-
day morning when the Alligator announced
that several of the current senators of the
Unite Party have criminal records, includ-
ing Student Body President Jordan Johnson.
I felt like I was suffering from a terrible case
of deja vu as I recalled last fall when mem-
bers of the then Gator Party stole newspa-
pers from different campus locations when
the Alligator broke the story of e-mails be-
tween top Gator Party members discussing
how they were going to keep the Orange
and Blue Party out of critical positions in
Student Government.
As if this wasn't bad enough, one of the
other letters in Thursday's edition of the Al-
ligator included a letter written by a former
Gator Party senator claiming that this paper
constantly bashes the majority party.Needless to say, this got me a little miffed.
This paper can't be faulted for doing good
reporting; the Alligator was merely bringing
to light the facts about the students who are
currently in control of our government.
More importantly, if the majority party,
whether that be the Gator Party of old or the
Unite Party of today, has to steal newspa-
pers to deflect some bad press, maybe they
should re-evaluate their actions.
All that said, I'm excited to sit in our new
$56 million student union. Three cheers for
reckless spending.

Article revealed disappointing trend
The paper was right to have published the
news about the students and their personal
records. It just seems to be a trend that we
have seen in the paper the last few weeks: a
student arrested for a DUI, an entire group
of people that was investigated for a large
party consisting of underage drinking, and
much more. All this happened within the
last few months.
If they plan on turning their lives around,
I suggest they attempt to do that before tak-
ing part in school organizations.

Students should plan for post-graduation
I found Hilary Lehman's column to be
particularly poor advice for students.
An unstable economy does not excuse
failing to plan for the future. Students
should be thinking more about what they
are going to do with their degrees when they
graduate, especially if they will be graduat-
ing with loans.
Instead of telling students not to worry
about things they can't control, why not en-
courage them to use the resources on cam-
pus that can help them plan for the future?
If you don't know what to do with your
major or your life, visit the Career Resource
Center. I suggest doing a Google search ofthe "Occupational Outlook Handbook" to
learn more about careers and to see if your
career choice is actually in demand.
I believe we are selling ourselves short
to accept Lehman's claim that "success has
been redefined." As someone in gradu-
ate school who has also seen many friends
graduate and enter the workforce, the peo-
ple who had to move back in with the par-
ents are the ones who didn't plan and think
about the future accordingly.

Timing of story shows Alligator bias
For about 20 percent of the Student Body
here at UF, the Student Government election
season is exciting. Let's count within that
group the Greeks (myself included), His-
panic Student Association, Black Student
Union and other large to semi-large student
groups that make up the majority coalition
party in SG. Pepper in the socialists, pro-
gressives and random concerned students
who make up the two minority parties and
boom -we have all of the students who are
currently giddy with excitement or abso-
lutely irate over the election results. These
students know (or are told) who they are go-
ing to vote for each and every election. Re-
gardless, their votes are set.
The issue is with the other 80 percent of
students who would vote or do occasion-
ally. Many of them become politically "in-
formed" from this very publication. They
read its endorsements and, more impor-
tantly, its articles. Now, I have never taken a
journalism class, but I was always under the
impression that an article in any newspaper
was supposed to have its biases removed by
the writers, and then from the editors.
However, the front page of this newspa-
per on Tuesday morning demonstrated oth-
erwise. The Alligator can no longer consider
itself politically unbiased. Its disposition for
the minority parties in SG has crept into its
news pages, and that is truly troubling.
Let me begin by saying that I don't takeFRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 7
issue at all with the content of the front-page
article claiming that the Unite, Gator and In-
dependent (Independents in Senate are in-
evitably Unite Party senators in all but the
rarest cases) senators and Cabinet secretar-
ies have criminal records.
Senators and Cabinet officials are pub-
lic officials charged with using millions of
our Activity & Service Fee dollars, and their
criminal records should be of concern to us.
As a check and balance, the Alligator there-
fore has the duty to report such transgres-
sions to the voting public.
However, it is the manner in which it was
done that proves the Alligator's clear SG bi-
ases.
Dropping this story on election day is
clearly irresponsible, especially when it is
the largest single article of the year and is
front and center in the morning's paper.
The timing was clearly meant to skew the
election results, otherwise Thomas Stewart
would have published his article weeks or
months ago.
How can I say that? Stewart reported on
criminal records as far back as 2006. While
it certainly qualified as news then, Student
Body President Jordan Johnson having a
house party three years ago is clearly irrel-
evant now. The same goes for all of the past
criminal records, especially because many
of the named individuals aren't even up for
re-election.
The Alligator ignored its journalistic duty
of remaining unbiased by publishing this
article on election day. Not only that, it de-
layed the reporting of news until it decided
it was relevant and served it politically.
I don't care if you don't like the voting
boards that Greeks use to coerce voting or
the way they slate candidates to satisfy each
house or student organization within their
coalition umbrella. I don't like it either, and
I am part of the process. But Stewart and
the Alligator editors should have retained
an unbiased stance outside of the opinions
pages.

Local female artists to perform at 'Girls Night Out'
Event was formerly called Gainesville Dyke Night
By MARIA PIQUET
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tonight is ladies' night.
Brophy's Irish Pub, 60 SW Second St.,
will host Girls Night Out, a live music
event that features women artists and per-
formers, at 10 p.m.
"We're trying to showcase the really
talented female bands," said Sarah Nel-
son, coordinator and co-founder of the
event. "This night puts a spotlight on fe-
male artists."Originally targeted at the gay commu-
nity when it launched in 2007, Girls Night
Out is open to people 21 and older of any
gender or sexuality.
"Anybody's welcome," Nelson said.
"I'd definitely love it if everybody of all
everything came out."
Local girl-and-banjo setup Lonesome
will kick off the night playing music in-
fused with the sound of the banjo. Other
local bands The Rochevanies, whose Fa-
cebook page describes their music as "riot
grrrl, country, we're not sure," will playpunk rock, and the State Of will end the
night with dark indie pop mixed with elec-
tronic and plenty of '80s covers to keep it
fun, Nelson said.
"We have some really great groups
Around playing so hopefully
Gainesville people will come out
to see them, and if they
haven't heard of them
hopefully they'll just trickle in," Nelson
said. "It's good music."
Girls Night Out, formerly called
Gainesville Dyke Night, has been happen-ing in Gainesville since 2007.
Nelson said she and Steph Taylor start-
ed it because there really wasn't anything
fun going on for women.
Now, the event is held every few
months.
With the Pride Parade this weekend,
the crowd is expected to be larger than
usual, Nelson said. About 150 people are
anticipated.
"With the festival, people will be a little
more excited about going out," Nelson
said. "And Brophy's is like a magnet for
these kinds of events."
Girls Night Out starts at 10 p.m. and
costs $5.

UF sustainability club to tour Gainesville's green locations
By ANDREW NORRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
For many, the sun is seen as an inconvenience during a
trudge to class or a reason to tan instead, especially during
Florida's seemingly endless summer.
This Saturday the UF Chapter of the American Solar Energy
Society is hosting the Central Florida Alliance's Gainesville So-
lar Tour. Gainesville is the third and final leg of a three-day 0
tour that aims to promote solar and sustainable energy.
The tour, which starts at 9 a.m. on the Plaza of the Americas,
will have guest speakers, a sustainability expo and a physical
tour of Gainesville. f
Jennifer Crews, a member of the UF chapter of the Amen- DeG of Er
can Solar Energy Society, said various speakers will talk about TOllen e }
how solar energy works and how to finance it.
The physical tour will visit local homes and businesses that DEF iTMENT OF use solar energy and other "green" practices, Crews said. F
The event will also feature the Pure Energy Solar Power \
Tower, a generator powered only by solar energy, Crews said. S R G Y
"This is going to be an educational and engaging way for the
people of Gainesville to learn about solar energy," Crews said.
"We hope this is something Gainesville can benefit from."
Richard Schackow, a real estate agent and developer in 00 Ne
Gainesville, is letting the tour use a recently completed home
in his development, Forest Creek. rid
The house, along with the rest being constructed, does not
use solar power, but it was built to be as energy efficient as
possible.

ANECDOTES, SLIDE SHOW.
By DAVID TINTNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Through a sea of emphatic hand mo-
tions, exotic accents and first-person ac-
counts, one woman spoke for thousands
Thursday at UF's Constans Theatre.
Judith Sloan, an actress and artist who
helped conceive the Crossing the BLVD
project, which portrayed through multime-
dia the trials and tribulations of the people
who live, work and sleep in the most ethni-
cally diverse locality in the United States -
Queens, N.Y.
Sloan and project co-director Warren
Lehrer fused a series of anecdotes with a
rolling slide show of the characters to show
their differences and give a sense of hope
that people can overcome their fears andlive peacefully together.
"You can be phenomenally expanded
by people who are very different from
you by just figuring out how to engage in
them," Sloan said. "I think the profundity
of some of the people we interviewed blew
us away."
One Arab man they interviewed owned
a coffee shop shortly after Sept. 11.
One night, six men trashed the store,
smashing mirrors and breaking chairs and
tables. When the police came and hand-
cuffed the culprits, the shop owner said he
would not press charges because he under-
stood the men's frustration.
The police were forced to let them go,
and a few hours later the men came back
and apologized. The shop owner and the
men talked around a coffee table through
the night and came to appreciate each oth-
er's differences.
Lehrer and Sloan started the project in
1999 and worked on it for three years. They
listened to hundreds of immigrants' storiesand took pictures of each subject.
"I was always interested in people that
come up from the bottom and pull them-
selves up from nothing," Sloan said. "Peo-
ple were surprisingly cooperative, and they
received so many stories that they had to
turn some people away."
"I think there is so much miscommu-
nication, especially with
people who are refugees
who fled," she said. "They
wanted to have their sto-Uries told."
Sloan said Crossing the
BLVD is the only project
of its kind whose footage
Sloan stretches before and after
Sept. 11.
The attacks marked noticeable changes
in people's attitudes, Lehrer said.
Another story they told was about a man
who fled the Democratic Republic of Congo
after his wife and daughter were murdered.
The man could not get a passenger flightout of the country, so he was forced to ride
in the cargo hold of a plane to an unknown
destination.
When he arrived in Queens, the man
was horrified to learn about the detention
centers set up after Sept. 11.
Although Lehrer does not like to travel,
he said he loves that in Queens you can go
"around the world" with a subway pass.
There are 138 languages spoken in
Queens, Sloan said.
"The airports are now the main ports of
entry for immigrants and refugees from all
over the world making Queens a modern-
day Ellis Island." she said.
Sloan and Lehrer are performing Cross-
ing the BLVD: Strangers, Neighbors, Aliens
in a New America across the country. They
also have a traveling exhibition, a book and
an audio CD.
They are each working on their own
projects now, but in the future they hope to
do another joint documentary on the Amer-
ican's sense of home.

Bus routes change for parade
By LYNETTE ZILIO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville residents looking for a
quick ride may encounter delays dur-
ing Saturday's Pride Parade.
RTS Routes 15, 400 and 410 will
have detours from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.,
bypassing University Avenue between
Southwest 10th Street and Southwest
First Street.The routes will detour their 12:30
p.m. departures from the Gainesville
Mall, Oaks Mall and Santa Fe College
respectively. They will be reversed for
their 1:30 p.m. departures.
Chip Skinner, RTS senior market-
ing and communications specialist,
said that only two buses on each route
would be affected during the hour-long
event.
Riders should plan accordingly so
that they will arrive at their destina-tions on time.
"People just need to be patient with
us that we'll get them to their destina-
tion," he said. "We always try to keep
our buses on schedule and cross-ref-
erence with ongoing construction on
Main Street and Depot Avenue."
RTS will have detours again for the
homecoming parade on Oct. 16.

RTS route detours or schedule changes,

Riders under 21 required to wear helmets

cydle without one."
Machen also helped out with the raffles at the event. Five
scooter helmets and two pairs of sunglasses were handed out
to members of the crowd.
Holly Turner Moses, an undergraduate adviser for the de-
partment of health education and behavior, said coupons for
helmet and local restaurant discounts will be passed out dur-
ing the week to encourage students to wear their helmets.
Banners reminding students to wear helmets will also beposted at heavily trafficked scooter parking lots, Moses said.
Wendy Alderman, president of Eta Sigma Beta, said the
Alachua County Sheriff's Office, the Gainesville Police De-
partment and the University Police Department will also
be enforcing scooter laws, which require riders under 21 to
wear helmets.
Alderman said she was involved in a scooter accident last
spring. Although she only had bruising and muscle damage,
the accident scared her. Alderman teamed up with Groves
after hearing the story of her accident.
"What she has been through is what really keeps me go-
ing" Alderman said.
Band's music to be featured in Barrymore movie
ETTES, from page 1
direction for the band. The new album
includes '60s girl pop, early punk and,
surprisingly, country, Hames said.
"[The songs] should make you want
to dance, make out or cry," she said."
Then we've done our job."
She added that the bands constant
touring makes a good environment for
creativity."If we didn't constantly get the itch
to keep moving,
we wouldn't get as
much done," Hames
said.
Starting with a
self-financed trip to
record at London's
Toe Rag Studios in
Barrymore 2005, where they
worked with the
producer of the White Stripes and theKills, the band really hasn't taken a
break, with three albums and expan-
sive U.S. and European tours, Hames
said.
The band's music will be featured
in an upcoming episode of HBO's
"Entourage" and on the soundtrack
to "Whip it!" the new roller derby film
directed by Drew Barrymore, who will
accompany the Ettes on Jimmy Fallon's
show tonight. More information can be

SPECIAL REPORT
Friction, time critical
for handwashing
By BRIDGET HIGGINBOTHAM
Alligator Contributing Writer
It's that life lesson that came
right after potty training: how to
wash your hands.
In the wake of the HINI swine
flu outbreak, the most basic form
of personal hygiene is being
stressed more than ever.
Maxine Hinze, faculty coor-
dinator of the Fundamentals of
Nursing course at UF, says most
people don't wash their hands
properly.
"Some people think they wash
their hands, but really they just
pass them under water," she
says.
But simple steps can make the
difference between rinsing and
washing.
Move your jewelry
Push your watch up your arm.
Hinze said health care workers
are encouraged to not wear jewel-
ry to keep from trapping germs.
Wet your hands and then
use soap. Run your hands un-
der warm water before applying
soap.
Scrub all surfaces
"Friction is important," Hinze
said. Rub your hands together
in circular motions, like you're
making a figure 8. Interlace your
fingers to make sure you clean all
sides. Be sure not to touch the in-
side of the sink at any point.
Pay attention to your fingers
Because your fingertips are the
most contaminated, keep them
angled downward.
Hinze's students use a powder
called Glo-Germ to see what ar-
eas they might have missed while
cleaning and under a black light.
Around and under the nails tend
to glow the most. You might want
to consider keeping your natural
nails short and not wearing fake
nails because they can harbor
bacteria.
Sing your ABCs
Washing your hands should
take about 20 seconds. To make
sure you're scrubbing for long
enough, sing the alphabet song
in your head.
Use paper towels. After rins-ing your hands, dry them with
a paper towel. Hinze and other
health care workers say to use a
fresh paper towel to turn the wa-
ter off to prevent from touching
the unclean faucet.
"It's just automatic with me,"
she said.
Don't depend on substitutes
While the ethanol in the in-
stant hand sanitizer gels is a
good disinfectant, it does not kill
germs immediately, according
to Paul Gulig, course director of
Medical Microbiology and Infec-
tious Diseases at the UF College
of Medicine.
Gulig recommends people
wash their hands and then use
hand sanitizer, if they'd like.
.I would have people
stay home when they're
sick because of respiratory
spread of the virus."
Paul Gulig
course director of Medical Micro-
biology and Infectious Diseases
at the UF College of Medicine
"Get rid of the dirt and bulk of
germs first by washing, and then
the sanitizer will have an easier
time finishing off the rest," he
said in an e-mail.
Wash them frequently
Always wash your hands after
you go the bathroom and before
you handle food.
The Centers for Disease Con-
trol's site on handwashing also
recommends it after touching
trash, animals, diapers and sick
people. If you blow your nose or
cough or sneeze into your hand,
you should wash your hands as
well.
While proper handwashing is
essential, it is not the most impor-
tant part of preventing the spread
of viruses like swine flu. Infected
people should stay home, and
everyone should be vaccinated,
Gulig said.
"If I could snap my fingers
and change human behavior to
deal with this epidemic," he said,
"I would have people stay home
when they're sick because of re-
spiratory spread of the virus."Copyrighted Material

Pomeranian hopes to win $1M
* OWNER WILL DONATE AT
LEAST HALF OF WINNINGS.
By CLARE LENNON
Alligator Contributing Writer
If presented with $1 million,
most people wouldn't spend half
their winnings on a fire hydrant-
shaped chair or arboreal d6cor for a
cat-petting room.
Amber Stovall would.
Stovall, 24, a who studies busi-
ness management at Santa Fe Col-
lege to work toward a degree from
Saint Leo Univerity, pledged to do-
nate $500,000 to the Alachua County
Humane Society if her dog Bella
wins a "Cutest Dog Competition."
Bella, a 1-year-old purebred Po-
meranian, is in the running for a
contest sponsored by All American
Pet Brands' Grrr-nola line of dog
food.
"I just did a quick search online
and saw how big this contest was,"
Stovall said. The online contest is in
its ninth week out of 12. Every week,
voters choose their favorite dogs
from a series of owner-submittedphotographs to advance to a semi-
final round, after which one winner
will receive $1 million.
A new voting week starts each
Saturday, and Bella has yet to be
elected as a semifinalist.
Stovall said that her current un-
employment has prevented her
from donating to the Humane Soci-
ety, but that this contest offers peo-
ple in similar situations a chance to
help out.
Around "A vote is aGainesville great way, if you
can't afford to
donate, to participate and help raise
some money," she said.
Although Stovall has already
pledged to donate half of any win-
nings, she said she may give more.
"Honestly, if she does just make it
to semifinals, I would probably just
give them the $500 because I want to
give as much as possible. It's all real-
ly based on getting your community
together. If I could get 1,000 people
to commit to voting every day, that's
7,000 a week."
Stovall particularly hopes she
and Bella can contribute to the Hu-
mane Society's fund to renovate thebuilding they recently purchased at
4205 NW Sixth St.
Executive Director Kirk Eppen-
stein said that the new facility, which
will cost approximately $2 million,
is designed to house more animals
and shorten their stay. Eppenstein
said that the maximum capacity will
increase from about 250 animals at
the current location to more than
500 at the new building. He empha-
sized new features such as tempered
glass dog doors instead of chain-link
fences, an increased number in cat-
petting rooms and odor control.
"We're making it very whimsi-
cal. .we want it to portray the hap-
piness of the animals finding a for-
ever home," Eppenstein said of the
new building, which is expected to
open in March.
"We're trying very hard to ask
people to help us with donations
with this project. We're not quite
ready but in the very near future
we'll have people sponsor rooms
with a price list for the sponsorship
of each room," Eppenstein said.
Until then, people who want to
help Bella can vote for her through a
link at alachuahumane.org.How

NATIONAL
'Call to Action' urges students to march for gay rights
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Richard Aviles spent his promnight march-
ing rather than dancing.
He said he could dance anytime he wanted
to, but this six-day march from San Francisco
to Sacramento, Calif., in the aftermath of Cali-
fornia's controversial approval of Proposi-
tion Eight, a state amendment that once again
made it illegal for gays to wed, was for his ba-
sic human rights.
Aviles, 18, now a student at St. Olaf Col-
lege in Northfield, Minn., is just one of the
thousands of students and concerned citizens
who will swarm to Washington D.C. and the
lawn of the Capitol on Oct. 10 and 11. They'll
demand equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender and Queer/Questioning peo-
ple in America during the National Equality
March.
"This is the civil rights issue of our gen-
eration," said Keeanga Taylor, Northwestern
University student leader.
The march's "Call to Action" is an appeal
to students across the country urging them to
take part in the march. It has hopes of "ending
the United States' system of inhumane segre-
gation that continues to discriminate against
LGBTQ Americans," and has been signed by
more than 100 Student Body presidents andstudent leaders across the country.
UF Student Body President Jordan Johnson
could not be reached for comment.
A major facet of the march is what organiz-
ers describe as a consistent violation of the 14th
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which
those involved with the marchbelieve LGBTQ
citizens have not been protected under.
"We believe there needs to be a national
message," said Kip Williams, co-director of
the National Equality March. "And that mes-
sage is equality in all matters governed by civil
law in all 50 states."
The march is largely being mobilized by
social media, including blogs, links on the
march's Web site and through the event's Fa-
cebook page, which as of 9:45 p.m. Thursday
had 46,854 fans.
Dave Valk, a recent graduate of UCLA and
the national student outreach coordinator for
the march, said more than 2,000 student lead-
ers from across the nation have also been con-
tacted to mobilize students to act.
"Our goal is to connect people, to create
open communication with students across the
nation to share resources," Valk said.
About 30 UF students crowded into a small
classroom in Anderson Hall Thursday night
at a meeting for those interested in joining the
march.
UF freshman Corey Davila decided hewanted to travel to Washington D.C. to be part
of a bigger movement.
"There's no way I can miss this," Davila
said. "I'm so excited."
"We believe there needs to be a
national message. And that mes-
sage is equality in all matters gov-
erned by civil law in all 50 states."
Kip Williams
National Equality March co-director
The march this year holds an even greater
significance, three days after the National
Equality March will mark the 30th anniver-
sary of the National March on Washington for
Lesbian and Gay Rights, which an estimated
100,000 people attended.
"We're not willing to wait another 30
years," Williams said. "We want equality, and
we want it now."
Davila believes the media touts gay mar-
riage as the most critical issue facing the LG-
BTQ community, but it is not necessarily the
most important.
"I think it's more important to be able to
live every day without having to worry about
getting fired from your job and just being dis-
criminated against on a day-to-day basis," Da-vila said.
Taylor compared the National Equal-
ity March to the 1963 March on Washington,
where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his
famous "I Have a Dream" speech. He said it
will not necessarily end discrimination in one
weekend but will bring LGBTQ issues into the
national eye.
"For LGBT people who are tired of being
treated like second-class citizens, last Novem-
ber was about enough is enough," Taylor said,
referring to Arizona, Florida and California's
approval of amendments to ban gay marriage
and Arkansas' ban on allowing unwed cou-
ples to adopt.
Churches and community centers across
Washington D.C. have volunteered their floor
space for those attending the march who need
a place to sleep.
Williams was quick to emphasize that this
march is not an endpoint. The march, accord-
ing to Williams, is the first step toward build-
ing a national grassroots campaign to achieve
equality.
"It's a crucial time for LGBT students,"
Aviles said. "We're here to tell you not to live
afraid. That's why this march is so impor-
tant."

Sports Brand Picks Column.
This year, we're committed to going
hard every week, so you get yet another
chance to see us fail miserably at pick-
ing 10 games. But first, we've got Phil
Kegler and Bobby Callovi debating one
of the SEC's best games this weekend,
Auburn at Tennessee.
AUBURN WILL COVER THE +1.5 POINT
SPREAD BECAUSE .The oddsmakers
must have been on some hard drugs
when they made this line, and Tennes-
see has a quarterback who shouldn't be
starting even if he was playing JUCO
ball. I think Jonathan Crompton cele-
brates when he eclipses 100 yards pass-
ing, something he couldn't do against
mighty UCLA. Meanwhile, Auburn
-yes, Auburn! -is tied for first in the
SEC in total offense, racking up more
than 500 yards a game. The Tigers may
have gone 5-7 last season, but they are
going to run up and down Neyland Sta-
dium, leaving UT D-coordinator Monte
Kiffin to ask for volunteers to stop the
bleeding.
-PHIL KEGLER
WHY TENNESSEE WILL WIN BY MORE
THAN 1.5 POINTS .In this battle be-
tween two coaches new to the South-
eastern Conference with bad quarter-
backs, it will come down to running
the ball and playing defense. As Ten-
nessee safety Eric Berry proved against
Florida, he is the best defensive player
in the country, and more importantly,
he doesn't have to worry about tack-
ling Tim Tebow this time. Also, this is
a game in which UT coach Lane Kiffin
can just try not to getblown out and still
have a chance to win as long as Cromp-
ton, his quarterback, can complete a
few passes. -EBOBBY CALLOVI

Mary Wise is 38-1 against Kentucky during her 18 years as UF's coach. The
Wildcats beat Wise and the Gators in Lexington last season.In the span of a season, one of Florida's oldest vol-
leyball rivalries has changed from a traditionally lop-
sided affair into a battle for conference supremacy.
Entering last season, UF held a 37-0 record against
Kentucky under coach Mary Wise. The Wildcats got
their first victory against the Gators in 18 years with a
3-2 decision in Lexington and came within two matches
of winning the regular-season Southeastern Conference
title.
In the end, Florida won its 18th straight conference
championship by defeating South Carolina, and Ken-
tucky lost any title hopes in a loss to Tennessee.
So far this year, the No. 15 Wildcats (13-1, 3-0 SEC)
have proven they can remain a con-
tender in the championship run, having
not dropped a set in conference play
and sweeping an Ole Miss team that
Volleyball took the Gators to five sets.
No. 5 Florida (10-1, 4-0 SEC) will
take on Kentucky in a top-15 show-
down tonight in the O'Connell Center. UF will then
host Tennessee (9-4, 2-1 SEC) on Sunday to round out
what Wise has called the toughest two-match weekend
of the season.
Even during her time serving as an assistant at UK
from 1986-90, Wise said she knew the Wildcats could
hold their own against tougher competition, so their re-
cent improvement hasn't come as a shock to her.
"It's not surprising, as good as they are. It's one of
the highest-octane offenses in the country," Wise said.
"They could easily be undefeated right now. This is a
regional championship-quality team we're playing Fri-
day night.
"This is Kentucky's year. I think the only surprising
thing for us is that they're not ranked even higher."
UK's only loss was in a five-set road match against

UF heads to Notre Dame meet
0 THE NO. 15 WOMEN WILL
FACE NINE RANKED TEAMS.
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
With both teams having wins
under their belts, UF's men's and
women's cross country squads are
hoping to finish strong against na-
tionally ranked teams at the Notre
Dame Invitational, which begins to-
day at 4:15 p.m.
The No. 15 women's team will
face the defending national champi-
ons, No. 1 Washington, along with
No. 3 Florida State and seven other
ranked teams during the 5K run.
"Washington is going to be there,
and they have a lot of returners,"
junior Charlotte Browning said. "It
will be very exciting to see how we
will finish compared to all of the
great teams who will be there this
year."
Browning, who finished first in
UF's meet on Sept. 18, said she is
more fit this season, and the wom-
en's team has been training hard for
the tough competition it will face.
The unranked men's team, which
finished tied for sixth last year at this
event, will be facing eight ranked
teams at the invitational on a five-
mile course. The five teams that fin-
ished ahead of the Gators last year,
along with Notre Dame, which tied
with UF, advanced to the NCAA
Championship. Florida did not.
Justin Taylor, who finished in
15th place last season at Notre Dame,
said he hopes for the men's team to
end up in the top three.
"We have a solid team who can
get the job done," Taylor said. "I
don't think finishing top-three is
unreasonable. I think it is pretty do-
able."
Taylor did not compete in the

season that flared up a few days
beforehand. He will compete in the
five-mile course in South Bend, Ind.
Anthony Morales, who finished
second at the Mountain Dew Invita-tional, said he was sick with the flu
following the race. Morales credits
the nasal-spray flu vaccine given to
both teams for keeping the majority
of the runners from becoming ill.

CONS: Doesn't exactly connect with young, hip American
culture. Sometimes less exciting than watching paint dry.
Whispering announcers.
BEST AMERICAN ATHLETE: Tiger Woods.
HOCKEY
FLAGSHIP ORGANIZATION: NHL
PROS: Tough-as-nails eastern Europeans checking each
other into the boards and dropping the gloves. Fast-paced
action. Incredibly impressive to watch in person. Barry Mel-
rose's mullet. Osama Bin Laden-style playoff beards.
CONS: Toothless smiles. Postgame interviews filled with
"aboot" and "eh?" Two halftimes. The same lack of diver-
sity as a frat guy's wardrobe (I imagine their closets look just
like Doug Funnie's. Hm .boat shoes, khakis, Easter egg-
colored polo and Croakies it is!)
BEST AMERICAN ATHLETE: Mike Modano.
NASCAR
FLAGSHIP ORGANIZATION: Sprint Cup
PROS: High speeds and violent crashes. Milk, beer and Pep-
si showers in the winner's circle. Angry rednecks who take
road rage to the next level.
CONS: Left turns followed by left turns followed by more left
turns. The car is more important than the skill of its driver.
Makes hockey look as diverse as Turlington on a weekday

BEST AMERICAN ATHLETE: Jimmie Johnson.
SOCCER
FLAGSHIP ORGANIZATION: English Premier League
PROS: The most global sport of them all. Passionate fans.
Uninterrupted action with a definite amount of time you
need to watch an entire match.
CONS: Ties. As American as sushi, Borat and BMW. Fewer
goals than a high school dropout. Obnoxious fans who act
as though Americans are beneath soccer.
BEST AMERICAN ATHLETE: Landon Donovan, Jozy Altidore.
MMA
FLAGSHIP ORGANIZATION: UFC
PROS: Quick fights with lots of bloodshed and knockouts.
Watching different fighting styles clash. Perhaps the most
diverse sport of all. Joe Rogan. Dana White.

Gators look to continue conference success on road
* UF WENT 0-2 ON ITS LAST
ROAD TRIP.

If the light is just right, you tilt
your head a bit and squint, you may
be able to catch a glimpse of it.
A freshly furnished bull's-eye
on the back of the UF soccer team.
That's what happens when you
go undefeated in conference play.
After finishing 11-0 in the South-
eastern Conference in 2008, the No.
7 Gators (8-3, 2-0 SEC) look to con-
tinue the trend as they go on their
second road trip this season -this
one against SEC foes in Mississip-
pi.
The soccer team traveled to
Starkville and will play Mississippi
State (8-2, 0-2 SEC) tonight and Ole
Miss (7-2, 1-0 SEC) on Sunday in
Oxford.
The Gators went 0-2 on their last
road trip, but success breeds confi-
dence. UF is a confident team after
its three-week home stint.
"We've experienced loss on the
road, and we don't want to feel that
again," junior Nicky Kit said.
UF went 5-1 at home in Septem-
ber, losing to No. 5 FSU 1-0 in over-
time.
"The more experience you get,
especially with a young team, the
better you're going to get," UF
coach Becky Burleigh said. "But Ithink that our team understands
that there's such a small margin of
victory or defeat."
Freshman Holly King said her
newfound experience is reflected in
her game."I feel more composed and defi- end triggered a new mindset for the

Junior Nicky Kit and the Gators have won 22 consecutive regular-season conference matches dating
back to Oct. 7, 2007. UF's last SEC loss came in a 2-0 decision against Tennessee in Knoxville.conference play with wins against
Kentucky and Vanderbilt.
The team even had a meeting
where older players reminded the
younger players about the signifi-
cance of netting three points for
every conference win and going
undefeated again.
"Every team wants to beat us,
and because we are the top dogs
basically, other teams always want
to see Florida lose," senior Jessica
Eicken said.
It may be in the Gators' favor
that MSU made up a rained-out
game Tuesday night, meaning it'll
be playing on three days' rest. MSU
lost 1-0 to Alabama and dropped to
0-2 in the SEC.
With forecasts in Starkville
showing thunderstorm show-
ers Thursday night and morning
showers today, the players could be
playing on a huge slip n' slide.
Too wet a field would slow the
ball down and risk cleats getting
stuck in the mud. If it's milder, the
rain may make the ball skid more
on the grass, which would be to
the Gators' advantage with their
speedy team and keep-away play-
ing style.
Rain, shine, humid or dry, UF
will look to dampen MSU's bid to
bring down the Gators from the
SEC soccer summit tonight.
"People are tired of Florida win-
ning," Kit said. "They don't care
who it is (winning) -they want
someone else, as long as it's not
Florida."
PICKS, from page 21
Now, on to the picks!
Spending yet another week in the No. 1 spot with a 22-17 record is Mike "Wait, was I sup-
posed to say something?" DiFerdinando, who inexplicably went silent during one of his later
takes for our commercial Thursday. DiFer must have been daydreaming about Washington
quarterback Jake Locker in his unmentionables.
Continuing the excellence by people named Mike in second with an 18-21 record is Mike
"Soccer mom" McCall, who had such fun driving all of us around during the Kentucky trip that
he now has a strong desire to use a similar form of transportation to the remainder of UT's road
games. He felt so embarrassed when the UT football team didn't want his orange slices and juice
boxes.
Checking in at third with a 17-22 record this week is the Miami Herald's Joe "They're just
making all this flu stuff up" Goodman, who was playing conspiracy theorist early in the Ken-
tucky game and wondering if Tim Tebow really had the flu. We're not really sure how serious
he was, but Tebow's concussion was believable enough for Joe.
Leading a three-way tie for fourth at 16-23 is Ed "Back procedure expert" Aschoff, who must
be the only one on the planet still wondering when wide receiver Carl Moore and cornerback
Jeremy Brown will return to the playing field.
The middle part of the tie is Bobby "Seriously, I have to poop" Callovi, who spent more time
in restrooms across the southeastern United States last weekend than he did actually consuming
food. McCall offered to fold down the back seat and change his diaper right there in the Sienna,
but Bobby's been potty-trained since freshman year.
Wrapping up the logjam at fourth place is the Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy "Did Tim Tebow
just sneeze?" Fowler, who might be giving his most comprehensive coverage of an injury since.
well, a few weeks ago when Andre Debose went down. Call him a lot of things, but incomplete
isn't one of them.
Beginning a two-way tie for seventh at 15-24 is the Florida Times-Union's Mike "Head-to-
head doesn't matter, right?" DiRocco, who inexplicably has undefeated Houston five spots be-low one-loss Oklahoma State in his most recent AP poll ballot, despite the Cougars' 10-point
road win over the Cowboys on Sept. 12. Then again, memory loss is a key sign of aging.
Also sitting in seventh place is Kyle "Wait, where is everybody going?" Maistri, who will be
the only one of the five football writers staying in Gainesville this weekend because he doesn't
have a girlfriend. He's doing the next best thing -covering UF's volleyball match with beat
writers Adam Berry and Anthony Chiang.
Having moved out of the cellar but still sitting in ninth at 13-26 is Phil "What? I can't hear
you" Kegler, who has perfected the art of using headphones to avoid unwanted conversation in
the office. What he doesn't know is that we're never talking to him anyway.
In dead last place with a piss-poor record of 8-31 is the Palm Beach Post's Ben "George
Costanza" Volin, who has gone a miserable 1-18 in picking games the last two weeks. Ben, pre-
tend like picking these games is the same as picking up freshman girls at a bar -if your intuition
says you have a chance, just go the other way.
