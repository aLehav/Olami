Satchel’s Pizza, located at 1800 NE 23rd Ave., remains closed for renovations on Sunday afternoon. 
Owner Satchel Raye said the restaurant will likely be closed for three months.
� THE RESTAURANT HAS 
RAISED ABOUT $35,000.

  In the days following the Feb. 
28 ﬁ  re that will keep Satchel’s Piz-
za closed for three months, owner Satchel Raye was thinking of how to help the 50 Satchel’s employees who were left out of work.
  They’d collect unemployment, 
he said, but it wouldn’t be enough.
  “We have a lot of people with 
kids and mortgages,” Raye said.
  Satchel’s Pizza usually pays 
out $27,000 every two weeks. That doesn’t include tips.
  To help with the bills, he created 
the Satchel’s Pizza Employee Re-lief Fund on IndieGoGo, an online fundraising website.
  Raye initially wanted to give the 
fundraising page three weeks to raise $20,000 instead of two weeks. If the fundraising goal wasn’t met, Satchel’s would have to pay Indi-eGoGo a percentage of the dona-tions.   
  The page raised $1,000 within the 
ﬁ  rst hour. About 24 hours after the page went up, the Satchel’s Pizza Employee Relief Fund had met its goal of $20,000.
  “I could just refresh my page and 
the money was just going in there,” Raye said. “It was just mindbog-gling.”
  As of press time, 641 people had 
given a total of $35,416 to the fund-raiser.
  Lisa Duke, who teaches advertis-
ing at UF, ﬁ  rst heard about the ﬁ  re at Satchel’s Pizza on Facebook.
  “I was really sad because I love 
that place,” she said. “I take my son there.”
  Just after that, one of Duke’s stu-
dents posted about the Satchel’s In-dieGoGo page.
  Duke knew she had to help. She 
gave $200.
  Duke said the creativity of the 
restaurant is what touched her so deeply and made her want to help.

   After passing a statewide budget 
that hit universities’ wallets hard, Florida legislators passed bills that will allow UF to increase tuition more than 15 percent and self-insure state employees.
  While bridging a $2 billion gap be-
tween the House of Representatives’ and the Senate’s proposed budgets, lawmakers slashed $300 million from the State University System.
  The legislature ﬁ  nally settled on a 
budget of $70 billion, and UF’s will be about $36.5 million lighter.
  The cut was shallower than last 
year’s, which took $54 million from the university’s budget.
  Although there’s no plan in place 
yet for how to distribute the budget cuts, administrators are breathing a sigh of relief.
  “We are fortunate that it is not 
as high as it could have been,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando told the Alligator on Friday.
  On Thursday, 
legislators passed SB1752, which would allow state universities that meet certain criteria to raise tuition by more than the cur-
rent cap of 15 per-cent per year.
  UF and Florida State University 
are the only schools that meet the re-quirements this year.
  The bill was sent to Gov. Rick Scott,  Legislature approves bill that

Guest column
  Dear fellow Gators,
  I wrote this column because I 
would like to apologize for my actions 
three weeks ago. Disposing of newspapers is 
not only wrong, but it is unfair to the Student Body and the Alligator staff that works so hard to write them every day . I am sure many of you can recall a time when you thought with your heart and not with your head. This was surely one of those times. My actions were uncalled for and I sincerely apologize for them.
  Each election season is undoubtedly the 
craziest portion of every Student Government member’s semester.  When Katie Waldman and I were walking around campus, I let my sense of competition get in the way of the integrity and everything I believe I have always striven for in my time at UF. The Alligator has been an institution at our great university for decades and should receive the respect it deserves. I sincerely apologize to the members and staff of the Alligator, the university students and the members of SG.  
  I am sure many of you have questioned the 
integrity of SG during this past election, but I truly hope you will reconsider. During my two years of service in SG at UF, I worked as hard as I possibly could to beneﬁ  t each and every stu-dent on our campus. I know, as I move forward after SG, that the organization is in great hands. Newly elected Sen-ate President Aun-dre Price and Senate President pro tem-pore Logan Harri-son are dedicated to making the student experience better at our university and will do whatever they can to ensure 
that doesn’t change.
  I realize that I have hurt people in both par-
ties with my actions and denial of these actions — a lot of people who put a lot of trust and faith in me over the years. I truly apologize for the harm I have caused.
  Everyone makes mistakes, whether it be a 
poor grade on exam by not studying, running a red light or just making a bad decision dur-ing an election. But don’t lose your faith in that individual or that organization. SG has been helping students for more than 100 years, and I know that is exactly what they will continue to do. I hope everyone had an awesome and safe Spring Break, and I wish you the best of luck on the rest of your semesters.
  Take care, and go Gators!

March 12, 1976 — UF football players are reward-
ed up to $200 in personal gifts every time the Gators 
play a bowl game. The Athletic Association spends more than $20,000 a year on gifts for athletes. All var -
sity athletes receive different gifts and rewards such as rings, letter sweaters and leather jackets, for their participation, according to head football coach Doug Dickey.
March 12, 1981 — The UF Food Service Advisory 
Committee approved new 1981-82 meal plans that will cost between 13 and 20 percent more than the previous years. New meal allotments for the week include 10, 14 and 19. Under the new plans, students are allowed $2.85 for one meal and $3.65 for the next every day , compared to the current allowance of $2.25 and $2.75 for meals during the day.
March 16, 1982 — Two students have charges 
dropped against them after a police report was filed stating they were engaged in a homosexual act. Ac-cording to a police report, University Police Officer Randy Norris went to the third-floor Peabody Hall bathroom after a secretary told police about two stu-dents remaining in the bathroom for an “unusual amount of time.”

that business,” she said. “I really feel like Satchel put himself in that build-ing.”  
To help with the cost of buying new 
ovens, which Raye said probably won’t be covered by insurance, he put a foot-ball signed by Will Muschamp and a basketball signed by Billy Donovan for auction on eBay. A Satchel’s fan donat-ed a football signed by Tim Tebow to the auction.
Double Down Live will host a ben-
efit show on Wednesday featuring Satchel’s employees’ bands.All of the money raised at the door 
will go to the employee relief fund, ac-cording to Double Down social media manager Mat Poe.
The day after the fire, Raye thought 
Satchel’s Pizza would be closed for about a month. Now he thinks it will be at least three.
The fire damaged the ceiling and 
walls and the building needs a new electric system. The restaurant needs another exit to meet safety codes. Raye is also taking the opportunity to make the kitchen a little bigger.
“The whole thing kind of quickly 
escalates and snowballs into a bigger project,” he said.
In the meantime, he said, he’s trying 
to stay positive.
The well-wishes of fans on Facebook 
and by email, the calls and texts and the “get well soon” cards from local busi-nesses have been so uplifting, he said.
“It’s quite startling how many real 
big fans are out there that are wanting to wish us well and are looking forward to us opening back.”

Bill waiting for approval from Gov. Scott
whose previous promise to not raise 
tuition makes it difficult to predict whether he will sign the bill.
During last year’s legislative ses-
sion, UF President Bernie Machen proposed a 30 percent tuition in-crease to cover budget cuts.
The Board of Governors has the 
power to approve or deny proposals for tuition increases.
Machen has long campaigned for 
the ability to charge higher tuition, citing that UF has different needs than other state universities.
Student organizations such as the 
Florida Alliance for Student Action have lobbied against the provision throughout the legislative session and have demanded Scott keep his promise to not raise tuition by veto-ing the bill.
Lawmakers also passed an 
amendment that would give UF the green light to insure state employ-ees under GatorCare, a new model of health insurance.
The model, according to its web-site at healthplan.ufl.edu, will in-clude more choices of health care providers, keep health care costs competitive and improve access.
It already covers all Shands em-
ployees in Gainesville and Jackson-ville, graduate assistants and post-doctoral associates.
The bill would allow UF to insure 
faculty and staff, including IFAS faculty and staff all over the state and UF physicians in Gainesville and Jacksonville.

Gainesville artist Melanie Peter 
walked toward an art exhibit as pro-
testers set up their exhibit outside.
Inside, Peter walked past bottles 
of wine and trays of delicately sliced meats. Outside, resident Maria Par -
sons lined up bottles of water and a basket of eggs — all contaminated, she said.
The artist went past two security 
guards and into the gallery. An etch-ing of a skull and crossbones, a jun-gle-like oil painting and other pieces lined the walls. The signs lining the sidewalk outside also showed skulls and crossbones, but for a different reason.
Peter said the art project inside 
and the protesters outside represent voices crying for change.
“We all have our different, var -
ied skills,” she said. “I personally can’t do that — going to meetings and thinking on my feet and argu-ing. But I can paint.”
The art show, “Region 4: Trans-formation through Imagination,” was created to showcase city artists’ feelings about the history and clean-up of a chemically toxic site in north-east Gainesville called the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site. During the show’s March 2 opening, about 300 people packed into the Thomas Center to see the exhibit and discuss the site. The show will be on display until April 28.
About 30 years ago, the Cabot-
Koppers site was deemed envi-ronmentally hazardous by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . Kids weren’t allowed to play near the area anymore. People were wor -
ried that a nearby creek was danger -
ous, and it was. Cancer concerns still loom.
Since then, residents and local 
governments have protested — some with letters, some with chants. For the artists, the works in the art project were a form of protest. But for the protesters, the art show didn’t help the situation.
For those living near the Cabot-
Koppers Superfund site, listening to roughly 30 years of cleanup negotia-tions hasn’t been easy . 
Some are frustrated. Some are fu-
rious. And others say they are happy to see something being done, even if it isn’t all they hoped for.
The exhibit prompted a few resi-
dents to put their dissenting emo-tions on display . The group, which fluctuated between three and five through the afternoon, came armed with arguments against the art proj-ect’s intentions and inspirations.
The art show ranged from taped-
up paperwork and video testimo-nies to a branching tree of bones, twigs and mementos.
Peter’s work, an oil painting of a 
dense, jungle-like creek, hung near the entrance.
Her work has more luscious trees 
and palm fronds than its inspiration, Springstead Creek, has. She said the creek isn’t the same now that it’s dangerous to drink the water or sink your feet into the cool soil.
“This is my imagination of how it 
was and could be again,” she said.
While gallery-goers meandered around the pieces quietly, some pro-testers called out to bystanders as they left the building.
Susan Fairforest, a Gainesville 
resident, held a sign chastising the EPA, the organization responsible for cleaning up the Superfund site.
She said she decided to protest to 
get people to pay attention to the big picture of the cleanup plan. The EPA plan mentions removing topsoil from contaminated yards, but there are no stipulations for relocation.
“We’re hoping that people will 
see the other half of what’s going on, not just the feel-good part,”she said. 
The city, with neighborhood-or -
ganized Superfund Art Project, used a $24,000 grant from a state cultural affairs division to host the show. The city gave an equal amount to the project by paying for the building to be open during the exhibit and for staff time.
Some protesters didn’t approve 
of funding an art show when there is an unfulfilled need in the city.
Parsons said she believes avail-
able money should first be used to relocate residents from neighbor -
hoods near the site. Some are sick. Others have died. She and other supporters blame the contaminants, such as cancer-causing dioxin, from the Superfund site.
Others disagree with the pur -
pose behind the art show — to show a hopeful scenario in the midst of a bad situation — because they be-lieve the project requirements bor -
dered on censorship.
According to a call to artists, the 
project was meant to showcase “clo-sure and a positive outcome, not ac-cusation and condemnation.”
Mallory O’Connor, show cura-
tor, said there wasn’t any censorship of artists’ works.
But Peter said the art show made 
a point that artists and activists alike agree upon.
“It’s a powerful statement of 
what we won’t put up with as peo-ple,” she said. “These are alarms in some form or another that we have to clean up or die.”

Four letters, four numbers 
and about 90 million total 
views. KONY 2012.
On March 5, nonprofit orga-
nization Invisible Children Inc. posted a short film on YouTube about Joseph Kony , leader of African rebel group the Lord’s Resistance Army . 
According to the video, 
Kony has abducted tens of thousands of children for sol-diers and sex slaves.
The video launched a cam-
paign to rally celebrities and politicians to work for Kony’s arrest, and UF students are join-ing in.
A KONY 2012 Gainesville 
Facebook group has about 370 members. About 1,200 people clicked “attending” for Gainesville Paint the City, a na-tional night of hanging posters on April 20. 
Associate professor of his-
tory Paul Ortiz, who teaches an African diaspora course, said students should be smart about taking action. 
Though Ortiz said the cam-
paign’s efforts to educate are good, he suggests researching the organization before donat-ing or forming opinions. In-visible Children Inc. has been accused of manipulating facts and misusing donations.
“Don’t let your activity be 
guided by one documentary ,” he said.

Issues of Incentive
Insurance problem root 
of birth control debate  
Few would have thought that in 2012 one of the biggest top-
ics of debate would be birth control.
While aspects of this debate are important, some of the 
rhetoric from both sides has just gone too far and way off topic.
Rush Limbaugh’s distasteful remarks about the student who 
testified in front of Congress completely missed the point of the debate, claiming that she was asking the government to pay for her birth control.
This was not the case. The student said insurance providers 
at her school, the Catholic university Georgetown, should have to cover birth control due to its other medical benefits.
The main contention for those on the other side, namely 
from Catholic institutions, is that institutions and organizations should not have to provide coverage for something that goes against their beliefs.
For those hysterics on the far right, the government is not go-
ing to start providing free birth control to everyone. For those hysterics on the far left, conservatives are not trying to make birth control illegal.
But while the rhetoric has been heated at times, a crucial dis-
cussion has been absent from this debate.
We buy car, life and renter’s insurance on an individual ba-
sis, so why are we reliant upon our employers to provide health insurance?
When most Americans change employers multiple times 
throughout their lifetime, why is our health coverage tied to where we work?
That seems impractical.According to Dr. David Gratzer, author of “The Cure,” the 
reason stems from a mid-20th century change in the tax code.
In the early 1940s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt enacted 
wage and price controls, making it hard for employers to lower or increase the wages for their employees. As a result, employers had to find other ways to attract workers to their business.
On October 26, 1943, according to Gratzer, “the IRS confirmed 
that employees were not required to pay tax on health insurance premiums paid on their behalf by their employers. Health ben-efits would remain tax-free, an idea codified in the new [IRS] Code of 1954.”
Prior to this time, employers rarely provided health benefits 
to employees, but by 1987, “70 percent of employers offered health benefits.”
As a result, we have a system of third-party payers, in which 
ordinary people do not really experience the true cost of their health care.
This incentive limits a person’s need to shop around, limits 
competition in the health care marketplace and increases health costs.
More importantly, this entire debate about Catholic institu-
tions covering birth control would be moot without this tax in-centive.
Individuals would be in charge of shopping for health insur -
ance plans that cover the things they believe are important, and companies would not have to go against their consciences.Meditation helps when getting over someone
This column has high levels of Buddhism, so I apolo-
gize if I start to transcend meaning or pour you all a tad too much hippie Kool-Aid. I’ll try to remain 
grounded and, if I fail, I’ll try to do so adorably, like Sarah Palin or Ron Paul. This task is difficult when ultimate real-ity is free of all adjectives, you know?
First things first: All life is suffering. No matter how well 
off you are, you will experience suffering. Websites like whitewhine.com attest to that. I’ve had to dredge through a recent slew of shit that I could have done without — a guy I cared about cutting me out of his life and Taco Bell discon-tinuing the Beefy Crunch Burrito and replacing it with a more expensive taco with a shell that’s a giant Dorito.
Is nothing sacred?I hadn’t begun to get over the guy after a week or two, 
which is pretty atypical for me. And there’s only one thing a man can do when he’s suffering from a spiritual and exis-tential funk: meditate.
So I criss-cross applesauced and ohm-ed my way to 
some perspective and understanding.
I don’t have enough space to palatably reify the abstract 
mess that is the Dharmakaya — a fancy word that, for san-ity’s sake, means the body of Buddhist teachings — so bear with my inner hippie for a bit.
Just be cool and enjoy the ride, man.Imagine your body is a television set and the emotions 
stirred about by the things in your life are the infinite num-ber of channels you can display. Things to be happy and sad about are constantly in existence, and your demeanor arises from the ones occupying your focus. The Dharma-kaya offers a path toward the ability to see all of them at once.
When you can watch all the channels at once, you’ll start 
to see other people’s channels too, imagining yourself in other people’s positions and literally seeing and feeling from their perspective.
That is called the oneness of being — the ability to si-multaneously be yourself and see as someone else, whereby all in-volved can influence the perspec-tive of the others. All human suf-fering stems from ignorance and a disconnect with the oneness of being.
But if someone engages in the 
oneness of being and orients all perception toward the pursuit 
of happiness, that person will experience ultimate reality and be at peace with it, which is true happiness: enlighten-ment.
But how does any of that apply to getting over people 
who wrong you? Well, you know someone came along and smashed into your existence before speeding away from it, sending you spinning off the path to enlightenment and away from the oneness of being. You’re upset because you’re ignorant as to why they’re treating you like crap, or you’re caught up on “what’s best for them.”
Stop that. Smile. Meditate. Reorient yourself toward 
your happiness. Focus on the other person’s perspective, then be it. Identify the feelings keeping you apart and ac-cept it. Do not make judgments, even if it’s out of coward-ice or fear.
Soon you will understand why that person’s perspec-
tive cannot change to what you want it to be. Once you understand it, you can find peace with your situation.
Meditation will heal the damage when a guy does you 
wrong or when Taco Bell introduces tortillas made out of crepes. It will keep you serene when the French interpret that as an act of war and drop a nuke on us (which they’ll aptly name “Napoleon Blown-apart”).
Practice. If you truly inhabit the other person’s perspec-
tive, you will find peace.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Despite Rick Santorum posing as a hardcore lim-
ited-government conservative, his views on the economy, his voting record and his blatant hostility 
toward homosexuality portray him as more of a socialist dictator than a small-government guru.
Even with support from tea party members, who also 
portray themselves as a cult of small-government enthu-siasts, Santorum has time and time again voted in favor of huge spending bills that expand the role and size of the federal government.
In a piece that aired on NPR in 2006, Santorum said, 
“This idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever they want to do, that we shouldn’t get involved in the bedroom, we shouldn’t get involved in cultural is-sues ... that is not how traditional conservatives view the world.”
By “we,” he means the government.How that reasoning can fall in line with the ideas of in-
dividual liberty and small government should be beyond any person interested in protecting liberty.
Santorum plans on protecting heterosexual liberty in the bedroom by shuffling around mon-ey in the Department of Health and Human Services “for the purpose of strengthening marriages, families and fatherhood.”
The above quote comes straight from his campaign’s 
platform.
Why would anyone who believes in shrinking govern-
ment think the government should manage family life and the choices of consenting adults in the privacy of their own homes?
In addition to his urges to regulate personal behavior, 
Santorum has referred to the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell as “social experimentation with our military right now, and that’s tragic.”
If Santorum were a real small-government guy, he 
wouldn’t be following in the homophobic footsteps of cur -
rent and former communist states in which homosexuality is illegal.
Punishment and regulation of personal behavior is a 
characteristic of socialist dictatorships, Santorum. Not pro-capitalist democracies.
Nothing confirms his socialist beliefs more than his vot-
ing record. Santorum supported No Child Left Behind, which was the largest government expenditure on K-12 education in our nation’s history.
He also voted in favor of the Medicare Prescription 
Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act, which is pre-dicted to cost taxpayers $549.2 billion by 2015.
To add to his pro-government tax and spending record, 
Santorum also voted in favor of the Safe, Accountable, Flex-ible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Us-ers, costing the taxpayers another whopping $286.4 billion.
Extreme wealth redistribution via government spend-
ing, homophobia and regulation of personal behavior should not be the traits of a man who is associated with and supported by the tea party.
The socialism of Rick Santorum is a blemish on the face 
of conservatism, proponents of small government and pro-tectors of individual liberty.

College.

As players sat in the locker room, regrouping 
from the most physical game of the year, the truth 
started to dawn on them: They can survive without Will Yeguete. 
Even in a losing effort, that was proven Satur -
day.
“Right now, we were so close to winning that 
game that we’ve got a bad feeling from losing,” Young said after a few minutes. “I guess looking back at it, we’ll say there’s a lot of positives.”
UF hit 50 percent of its threes after failing to 
crack 30 percent from beyond the arc in its first two losses to UK.
The Gators ran an efficient offense and got ca-
reer games from Beal and Murphy.
Leading scorer Kenny Boynton had only two 
points on 1-of-9 shooting, but Florida managed to stand toe-to-toe with the nation’s best team for 39 minutes.
If they’d been sent to the foul line more than just 
twice, the Gators could have  been looking at a Sun-day matchup against Vanderbilt with a Southeast-ern Conference Tournament championship and NCAA Tournament three seed on the line.
“If we go as hard as we did [Saturday], I think 
we can do it without Will,” Boynton said. “We lost, and we’re never happy with a loss, but with the ef-fort we put out [Saturday] we’ve got to be happy with the way we played as a team.”
“That’s the number one team in the country , 
right there,” Erving Walker said. “They’ve been all year, and we were right there basically in a road game with them.”
When Yeguete went down with a broken foot, 
the Gators had to adjust. New rotations and dif-ferent roles needed time to develop, but now UF is ready.
Florida has put itself in a position where its fate 
will be determined by whether it knocks down shots. They’ve got the rest figured out.
Relying on 3-point shooting is a dangerous — 
and I’d argue nearly impossible — formula for winning a title, but at least it gives the Gators a chance. UF won’t be let down by leadership, team chemistry , role confusion or maturity . 
The way it handled those things on Saturday 
proved that.
“To be honest, I think we’re perfectly fine,” Beal 
said. “We all are still confident in what we’re ca-pable of doing. We just displayed that we can just compete just about with anybody in the nation, so we’re going to come in with a lot of confidence go-ing into the Tournament.”

UF sweeps Florida Gulf 
Coast, extends streak to 13
do a good job. I feel like I threw 
well.”
Junior right-hander Austin 
Maddox handled the ninth in six pitches — all strikes — and sat FGCU third baseman Zack Tillery down looking on three pitches to end the game. 
Sophomore Jonathon Crawford 
got his third start of the season for the Gators and worked 5.2 innings in 73 pitches. He allowed five hits and two runs, the second an An-drew Valencia RBI double in the sixth that negated the 2-1 lead Tur-geon’s home run had nabbed and effectively chased Crawford from the game. 
“It was great to get Crawford 
back out there,” O’Sullivan said. “Each time he goes out there, he seems like he’s getting better and better.”For Florida, the win meant a 
weekend sweep of FGCU and the extension of a winning streak that now stands at 13 games, one away from tying the school record. At 15-1, this is the best 16-game start for the Gators in school history, beat-ing out the 1952 team that started 14-1-1. 
Junior catcher Mike Zunino car-
ried the Gators offense on Friday 
night, notch-ing two home runs in a 4-2 vic-
tory. Saturday night’s game was all about top-of-the order offense as junior shortstop Nolan Fontana, Zunino and Gushue combined for five RBI in an 8-3 victory. 
“It was a great, great weekend 
for us,” O’Sullivan said. “But it was a well-played weekend for both teams and hopefully this will make us a better club.”

 Before the Gators knew their 
seeding or what far reaches of the 
country the NCAA Tournament se-lection committee would send them this week, they sat in the visitors locker room at New Orleans Arena on Saturday conﬁ  dent of their com-pleted resume.
  Florida’s schedule this season 
was littered with games against championship-caliber teams, includ-ing three meetings with No. 1 overall seed Kentucky , as well as road tests against No. 1 seed Syracuse and No. 2 seed Ohio State.
  “There’s no other teams we could 
have played to get ready for the NCAA Tournament,” Kenny Boyn-ton said. “We deﬁ  nitely have seen a lot, been through every situation. So I think we should go in with the mindset of anything is possible.”
  The common thread in each of 
those marquee matchups, however, was a UF loss.
  On Sunday, the selection com-
mittee pegged No. 7-seed Florida (23-10) to play 10th-seeded Virginia (25-9) in Omaha, Neb., on Friday .   Before being placed in the West 
Region of The Big Dance, both the Gators and Cavaliers ended their re-spective seasons by losing six of their last 10 games. Florida has dropped four of its last ﬁ  ve.
  “You have only got one shot at this,” Boynton said. “It’s just like [the Southeastern Conference] tour-nament, but this one is end of sea-son. You’ve got to give your all ev-ery game.”
  Though the Gators missed an up-
set bid against the top-seeded Wild-cats over the weekend, they came away from their 74-71 loss with a renewed conﬁ  dence.
  Florida fell in its previous two 
meetings with Kentucky by an aver-age of 17.5 points.
  “We’re making moves in the right direction for sure,” Patric Young said. “Everyone around here loves each other. We’re like a brotherhood. We’ve been going into practice with a good mindset, getting better each day , been committed to doing the right things, and hopefully we have the same mindset next week but the results will be different.” 
  Last season, the Gators were con-
sidered over-seeded as a No. 2 and went on an Elite Eight run which culminated in an overtime loss to eventual NCAA runner-up Butler. 
  ESPN analyst Doug Gottlieb said 
in a phone interview that UF had to avoid being placed in the eight- to- nine-seed range, which would mean a potential matchup with a No. 1 seed in its second game.
  Instead, as a No. 7 seed, the 
Gators will see the winner of No. 2 Missouri and No. 15 Norfolk State if they get past the Cavaliers.
  “Once you get past the top-three 
teams, and this is a group of teams that I thought Florida was in ... I mean, are they that much better than Duke?” Gottlieb said. “They’re far more athletic than Duke. They shoot it better than Duke and they should guard better than Duke. Their re-sults just haven’t been as good as Duke’s.”

  NEW ORLEANS
  It’s a long walk from the press confer-
ence to the locker room.
  After Brad Beal, Patric Young and 
Erik Murphy wrapped up their media session following Saturday’s loss to Ken-tucky , they began the return trip through the bowels of New Orleans Arena.
  Down the hall lined with blue 
curtains, up a ramp, across a tunnel, through a marble hallway, down the de-clined concrete path with white cinder block walls and through the third door on the left. It was an about 180-step, 400-foot trip that Beal, Young and Murphy made slowly, stoically and in near com-plete silence.
  They’d just ﬁ  nished their best game in 
weeks, but you’d never know it by their faces. They were down, disappointed, frustrated that their last and best shot at beating No. 1 Kentucky had slipped through their grasp.
  “ T h e y 
should be,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I would be 
disappointed if they felt like, ‘Wow, we really played hard, and happy day!’ I want them to be bothered. They should be bothered. Not to say this should lin-ger on for two weeks, but they need to understand that you can give that kind of effort in the NCAA Tournament and you go home.”
  If Florida gives that kind of effort in 
the Tournament, it might be a while be-fore they have to go home. Life without Yeguete: UF

 Jason Forjet’s 100th pitch proved to be too 
much for Florida Gulf Coast to overcome. 
  With a 1-2 count, the senior right-hander 
gave Taylor Gushue a slider low in the zone, 
but Florida’s freshman phenom got under it enough to deposit a souvenir over the right-ﬁ  eld wall. The seventh-inning homer gave No. 1 UF a 3-2 lead that would hold as the ﬁ  nal score. 
  “I just wanted to put it in play,” Gushue 
said. “It ended up going out, so I was happy about that.” 
  The blast was one of just four hits on the 
day for the Gators, who couldn’t muster a hit against Forjet through 4.1 innings before Gushue opened things up with a double. His ﬁ  rst hit of the day was immediately followed by a 2-2 long ball from freshman second base-man Casey Turgeon. 
  Before the back-to-back freshmen hits, 
Forjet had worked UF over with a steady changeup-slider-fastball mix that kept hitters off balance. Gushue said the Gators weren’t pressing and he knew the big hits would eventually come, but early on UF coach Kev-in O’Sullivan said he was very impressed by the Eagles’ mound presence. 
  “I can’t remember the last time we got no-
hit through four innings and it didn’t look promising early on,” he said. “[Forjet] was commanding his pitches, he was executing, he looked very comfortable.”
  After giving up Gushue’s homer in the 
seventh, Forjet was pulled and relievers R.J. 
Brown and Danny Patrick ﬁ  nished the game with 1.2 hitless innings. However, none of that mattered as the Gators were working bull-
pen magic of their own. 
  Sophomore lefty Dan-
iel Gibson needed just 30 pitches to work 2.1 hitless 
innings, striking out a career-high four bat-ters and picking up his ﬁ  rst win since Feb. 25 of last season. Three of Gibson’s strikeouts came looking, a trend on the day for the Ea-gles, who struck out looking six times. 
  “I threw yesterday and I knew that I was 
still hot today,” Gibson said. “When I got the call, I kind of knew that I had to come in and  Gushue’s blast propels Gators

Florida followed four straight games against 
unranked teams in which it outscored the opposition 77-19 with an 12-11 overtime loss to ninth-ranked Syracuse on March 3 before beating No. 15 Georgetown, 12-9, last Wednesday in Washington, D.C. On Saturday, UF throttled Temple in Gainesville, 20-3.
Junior attacker Gabi Wiegand had her second ﬁ  ve-goal game of the season against the Hoyas and scored an-other four times in the win over the Owls. Her 31 points on the season is good for second on the team behind fellow junior attacker Ashley Bruns.
� DEMPS TAKES EVENT TITLE IN 
60-METER DASH. 
Florida returns home from the NCAA 
Indoor Championships with its third straight national title for the men. Besides the team win, Jeff Demps 
(60m), Tony McQuay (400m), and Omar Crad-dock (triple jump), all won individual champion-ships. Senior Gray Horn, who entered the second day in first place for the heptathlon, had to with-draw from the competition after injuring himself during pole vault warm-ups. 
The women’s team finished in ninth after win-
ning the Southeastern Conference Indoor Cham-pionship two weeks ago. 
Although this weekend wrapped up the indoor 
season, both teams will have no time to rest as they open their outdoor season Saturday at the UCF Black and Gold Challenge.The No. 2 women’s tennis team has been 
dominant in Southeastern Conference play so far, starting 3-0 with wins against Tennes-see, Georgia, and Vanderbilt. The run was highlighted by junior Lauren Embree winning the SEC Player of the Week last week. Florida plays the continuation of a match against 
Kentucky today at 12:30. The No. 9 men have had a rockier start to conference play, going 2-2. Most recently, they lost a close 4-3 match at Kentucky. They will play at No. 1 Southern California next week.SoftballSoftball

Outscoring its opponents an astonishing 51-0 
in the Lipton Invitational, Florida had both its offense and pitching at top-notch levels over the break. However, in the Gators’ ﬁ  rst two series against Southeastern Conference opponents, there was a clear drop-off in performance. 
In ﬁ  ve games against Mississippi State and Tennessee, Florida scored an average of three runs per game com-pared to the 7.6 runs it scored against non-conference teams. Coach Tim Walton’s squad came out of the break with nine wins but suffered a key 1-0 loss against the Lady Vols in the Gators ﬁ  rst shutout this year.

No. 1 Florida kept surging during the break, 
going 8-0 and extending its win streak to 13 games — the longest stretch under coach Kevin O’Sullivan and one shy of the school record. The Gators kept that streak alive last week with timely hitting and a dominant bullpen. In the last eight games, Florida’s 
bullpen has tossed 32.2 innings and given up just one earned run while striking out 43 and walking six. During that stretch, the bullpen arms are 5-0 with four saves and a 0.28 ERA while opposing batters are hitting just .167 against them.
