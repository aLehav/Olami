Burned pizza wasn’t on the 
menu at Satchel’s Pizza, but that’s 
what customers were talking 
about as they stood in a line that 
snaked alongside the building.
People began lining up Friday 
at 10:20 a.m. for the 11 a.m. open-
ing, eager to get their hands on a 
slice of Gainesville legend. Satch-el’s Pizza opened its doors again Friday after a February ﬁ  re closed the restaurant for three and a half 
months.
“It’s nice to be back open,” said 
Satchel Raye, owner of Satchel’s. 
“It’s been so hard getting every-
thing back together.”
A burned pizza salvaged from 
the ﬁ  re is now enshrined in one 
of the restaurant’s clear-topped tables.
Raye estimates that he spent 
between $150,000 and $200,000 on repairs to the kitchen, which is the area that caught ﬁ  re in Febru-
ary.
The Gainesville community 
was ready to help.Part of that response was a 
show hosted by Double Down 
Live on March 14. All beneﬁ  ts from the show went to Satchel’s employees, who had to ﬁ  nd odd jobs while the restaurant was 
closed. Raye also set up an Indi-
eGoGo donation Web page for his employees, and the $20,000 goal was reached in 24 hours.
“People are all so excited,” 
Raye said. “We’ve had an over-whelming response — it’s been great.”
Workers spent 18-hour days 
trying to remodel and ﬁ  x the 
burned restaurant. They added an 
extra oven and a new pizza sta-tion as a part of the renovations.
Raye said the city was great 
with helping the process along and that the contractors he hired were great, but he’s glad the pro-

Three UF students are taking a class 
project from campus to the streets.
Chemical engineering sophomores 
Pearl Leung, 19, Michael Cornwell, 20, 
and Brittany Clendening, 19, planned a 
bus route to Lake Wauburg for a sum-
mer class project. They decided their proposal was worth more than a grade.
Clendening said the group hopes to 
give the proposal to the Regional Transit System by Summer B.
The proposed route would run every 
30 minutes on weekends starting at 9:30 a.m. and ending at 5:30 p.m.The bus would stop on campus, at 
nearby apartments and at Lake Wauburg, which offers recreation free for students and faculty . It is located eight miles south of campus on U.S. Highway 441.
The trio created a Facebook group 
called “RTS to Lake Wauburg,” which 
has more than 200 members.
They plan to present their proposal to 
RTS and UF Student Government.
Chip Skinner, marketing and com-
munications supervisor for RTS, said SG 
and the UF Transportation Access Fee Committee choose new routes.
Skinner said that if the proposal goes 
through, it is likely to start running in the spring or summer of 2013.UF students to propose

The dreams of about 800,000 undocumented 
students won’t be deferred, but their deporta-
tions will.
The Obama administration said Friday it 
will grant a two-year protection from depor-
tation to undocumented students who were 
brought to the United States before the age of 16 and allow them to apply for work permits.
The students must earn a U.S. high school 
diploma or a GED, or serve in the military, among other criteria. 
The policy is an adaptation of the DREAM 
Act, which was killed in Congress in 2010.Victor Yengle, president of Coalition of His-
panics Integrating Spanish Speakers through Advocacy and Service, or CHISPAS, was brought to the U.S. at the age of 12. 
When he was accepted to UF in 2009, Yengle 
was expected to pay international tuition.
“You feel like you’re in 
the door and you can see the other side, but you’re not able to step in,” he said.
Yengle, 23, established 
his permanent residency two years later, allowing him to 
pay in-state tuition and fulﬁ  ll his dream of being a Gator.
Yengle celebrated with 
undocumented friends on Friday.
“People were saying, ‘I’m going to be able 
to have a driver’s license for the ﬁ  rst time,’” he said.Adapted DREAM Act beneﬁ  ts

interactive and engaging expe-riences for museum visitors at Museum Nights. A group of 10 to 15 students from diverse academic backgrounds work ﬂ  y but does seem to be every-where in Lima: at political rallies and speeches, at a wedding shoot for Peru’s famed opera tenor Juan Diego Florez, hawking tours and ﬂ  ights on behalf of a travel agency in the central Plaza de Armas.

“Hola, Superamigo!” he’ll

Chavez became a superhero 15 
years ago after a failed go at bull-ﬁ  ghting and jobs as a craftsman, laboratory worker and brothel se-curity guard.
“I lost my job but realized that 
I could be Superman. I went to the store and bought a blue shirt and a cousin of mine who is a seamstress sewed the cape, the boots, the belt and the red tights,” he told The As-sociated Press.

Whitten Holmes stuck his tongue 
out, eyes locked on the project in 
front of him.
He started with a piece of green 
turtle-shaped paper. With the help of some stickers, red circles and a Popsicle stick, he soon held up a 
turtle fan.
Whitten, 4, was one of more than 
200 people who participated in the 
World Sea Turtle Day Scavenger Hunt. The event, sponsored by the 
Sea Turtle Conservancy, was held at 
the Florida Museum of Natural His-tory from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday.  
Participants made crafts, learned 
about turtles from experts and par -
ticipated in a museum-wide scaven-ger hunt.
“The goal is to get kids to be a lot 
more environmentally friendly with 
their actions from an early age,” said Rocio Johnson, public relations 
coordinator for the Sea Turtle Con-servancy.
Sea turtles are endangered, and 
people can help them by not using 
too much plastic and properly dis-
posing of trash, said Melania Lopez, Ph.D. candidate in the biology de-partment and member of the Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research 
at UF.
Abby McLeavy, 10, had a great 
time at the event. She likes turtles, 
particularly their size.
“I just like how big sea turtles 
are,” Abby said.

Some UF students learn best in a 
sterile classroom with a pencil. Others 
prefer a sterile meat processing facility with a band saw.
The UF Meat Processing Center 
sells retail meat out of the Department of Animal Sciences, 2250 Shealy Drive, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every Friday.
“Meat cutting is almost a lost art,” 
said Byron Davis, assistant manager.
Two full-time employees, eight un-
dergraduate UF students and three to four temporary graduate students work at the nonprofit facility, he said.
“It gives an appreciation of where 
their meat comes from,” Davis said.
It’s a two-mile drive from the field 
where the cows and pigs are raised to the processing facility.
The teaching hinders the profit of the 
operation, but the hands-on involve-ment is important to the students.
“This is the best experience you can 
get,” said Tommy Estevez, assistant manager of retail.
He said students can go into slaugh-
tering, food safety, research and devel-opment, and other fields after the kind of work they do with him.
“My No. 1 goal is teaching,” he 
said.
Estevez worked with meat for 22 
years at Publix, so he has the chops.
The retail store makes $5,000 every 
Friday , he said. Almost all of the money 
is used to buy more animals to raise and 
eventually be used to teach students.
He said he tries to instill his passion 
for butchering in his pupils.
“We enjoy it so much,” he said. “It 
really is a rush.”
One of his students now runs a meat 
facility for White Oak Pastures, a Pub-lix meat supplier.
Estevez said many people have a 
negative opinion of meat because of a critical media.
“This meat tastes the way it used 
to taste,” he said. “. . . we change the mindset of what food is, one person at a time.”
Celia Martin, 58, has been buying 
her meat from UF for a year.
“You know exactly what you are 
getting,” Martin said.
As someone who regularly bikes 
20 miles and tries to eat a healthy diet, 
Martin said she appreciates the fresh 
taste of the meat and the helpful staff.
“They know their meat,” she said.Students say they appreciate the op-
portunity to learn a useful trade.
Adam Spann, a second-year UF 
agriculture and biological engineering graduate student, has worked at the meat processing center since 2004 and learned about the job from his brother.
Spann, 25, said although butchering 
isn’t his career of choice, he now has a fallback career in a down economy.
“My next job will suck compared to 
this,” he said.

June 20, 1978: For the first time in UF history, 
summer enrollment passes the 15,000 mark. The 
previous high, which was 14,829, was reached in 
the summer of 1977. No reason is given by Regis-
trar Vernon Voyles as to why summer enrollment numbers continue to increase.
June 18, 1979: Athletics officials approve a $5 
increase in student football tickets. A plan is pre-sented by Student Body President Doug Tuthill 
to use the entirety of the $88,000 from the foot-
ball ticket increase for women’s athletics. The plan is rejected.
June 20, 1990: Police arrest Lynn C. Bassel, a 
27-year-old UF Animal Resources technician, for stealing rats from a campus breeding colony and selling them to a local pet store. Don Rogers, a UF police investigator, witnessed the sale of 106 
rats to a pet store but waited a day to make the

June 19, 1993: Two brothers, Timothy and

still able to raise $5,700 dollars for cancer patients 
in Gainesville and spend Father’s Day with their dad, Robert Holsbeke.
June 21, 2006: University Athletic Association 
officials conclude a three-day planning process for $12 million to $15 million of renovations to 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. The renovation plans 
include expansion of the southwest corner of the stadium and the weight room in addition to renovation of the football coaches’ offices. The

A mystery penis injury wasn’t 
the only problem William Davis 
faced early Sunday morning.
Police arrested William W. Da-
vis, 24, of Gainesville, on charges of domestic battery, resisting ar -
rest with violence and battery on 
an emergency medical techni-
cian.
Authorities responded to po-
tential suspicious activity at 2:40 a.m. Sunday at 3028 Northwest 76th Terrace, according to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office arrest report.
When an officer began to ques-
tion Davis, Davis told him some-one came to the door earlier and cut his penis with a knife.
While there was no damage 
to Davis’ clothing, according to 
the arrest report, the officer did 
notice an inch-long laceration on the base of Davis’ penis.
Davis refused to tell the officer 
who injured him.Davis’ fiancee, Suzanne Sieg, 
30, had a dime-sized scrape on her left hand. 
She originally 
told the officer an unidentified man scraped her with a knife, but after more 
questions Sieg 
changed her story.
According to the arrest report, 
Sieg said as she and Davis ar -gued about money issues, Davis pushed her to the ground, which caused her to scrape her hand on a brick step outside the house.
Sieg told the officer she lied 
because she didn’t want to get Davis into more trouble, since he was already on probation.
Davis was already being 
strapped onto a stretcher when the officer confronted him about the argument.
According to the arrest report, 
Davis became enraged when the officer questioned his story and jumped up from the stretcher.
He tried to walk back to his 
house and pushed the EMT on his way.
The officer tried to handcuff 
Davis, but Davis resisted.
Once they managed to get 
Davis back onto the stretcher, he 
grabbed the EMT by his shirt col-
lar and tried to drag him down-ward.
Davis was still in custody as of 
4 p.m. Monday, and his bond was 
set at $10,000.

cess is over.
“The whole fun is having people eat-
ing,” Raye said. “We don’t know how to build — we know how to feed people.”The first of those in line to be fed was 
Chet LaBarr, 41, and his two teacup chi-huahua-mix puppies.
“They probably weren’t even alive when 
this place was opened last,” LaBarr said.
He said he was shocked when he first 
heard of the fire from a co-worker at UF’s College of Medicine. 
He couldn’t wait to go back to one of his 
favorite restaurants.
The creativity and artistic quirkiness are 
part of why LaBarr said he loves Satchel’s, aside from the food.
LaBarr lined up in front of Satchel’s 40 minutes before the doors were set to open, something he planned on doing for weeks.
“I wanted to patronize the poor people 
who have been out of work for the past few 
weeks,” LaBarr said.

A car accident Monday afternoon re-
sulted in Gainesville Fire Rescue cutting 
a woman free from her car.
At about 4 p.m., Gainesville Police 
Department and GFR responded to a call about a two-car accident at the 700 block of Northeast Eighth Avenue.
Officials did not release the drivers’ 
names.
A 61-year-old man driving a painter’s 
van collided with a Toyota Prius driven by a 22-year-old woman at the intersec-
tion of Northeast Eighth Avenue and 
Northeast Seventh Street.
The van crashed into the Toyota, 
which might have run a stoplight, on the driver’s side. The woman was trapped  inside her 
car.
The van then drove into a fence at a 
nearby home.
GPD directed traffic away from the 
crash while GFR firefighters used hy-
draulic jaws and power tools to free the 
woman from the car.
Traffic around Northeast Eighth Av-
enue was blocked for about an hour.
According to GFR District Chief Jeff 
Lane, the man and woman are in stable condition.
Alachua County Fire Rescue took the 
woman to Shands at UF, he said.
The man did not receive any injuries 
at the scene because of his van’s airbags, Lane added.

One Gainesville dad is decid-
edly out of the running for any 
upcoming “father of the year” 
contests.
Police arrested Benjamin L. 
Dowling Sunday after he got into a physical fight with his ex-wife’s 
new husband.
According to the Gainesville 
Police Department, the prob-lem began when Dowling, 24, showed up at his ex-wife’s new 
husband’s residence on Father’s 
Day.
 He arrived to pick up his child for visitation.
Dowling was 
intoxicated, and his ex-wife re-
fused to let him 
see their child. 
She took the 
child and ran 
inside the house.When the woman’s husband 
tried to get Dowling to leave, 
Dowling responded by punching 
him in the face and then  tackling him to the ground. 
The man managed to get 
away, but Dowling followed and was able to force his way into the new husband’s house to continue fighting.
Dowling refused to comment 
when contacted.
He was arrested on charges of 
battery and burglary of an occu-pied dwelling. 
He was released from the Ala-
chua County Jail the same day — the end of an eventful Father’s Day.

Rules for medicine in 
schools lack sense
When you were in high school, did you ever visit the 
school nurse only to be told that they couldn’t give 
you any medication?
In most public high schools around the country, parents 
are required to sign medical release forms giving high school 
nurses and officials permission to give children prescription 
medication.
While it differs from state to state, school nurses are usually 
only permitted to give students mild over-the-counter medi-cation until their parents arrive. Sometimes, they aren’t even 
allowed to go that far.
While it is understandable that schools do not want to be 
held liable for treating students without parental permission, a case at Deltona High School in Volusia County, Fla., shows 
how absurd these rules can be.
Michael Rudi, 17, has asthma and was given a prescription 
for an inhaler to help him in case of an asthma attack.
While searching Michael’s locker in May, school officials 
confiscated his inhaler because his mother hadn’t signed a re-lease form for him to carry it with him.
The inhaler clearly belonged to Michael, given that it was 
still in the original packaging with his name and directions for 
use on it.
Eventually, school officials called Sue Rudi, Michael’s moth-
er, to tell her that her son was having trouble breathing. When 
Sue arrived at the school, she told WKMG that she found Mi-
chael on the floor in the midst of a “full-blown asthma attack.”
Sue Rudi also wondered why the school didn’t call 911 if it 
was so concerned about giving Michael his medication.
While it’s certainly understandable that school officials do 
not want to face lawsuits due to improper administration of medication, this case takes the cake for incompetency.
When Michael’s school records clearly indicated a history 
with asthma throughout his time in the school district, and an 
inhaler was found in its original packaging with his name on 
it, there is no excuse for the school nurse not to administer his 
medication.
According to WebMD, an asthma attack occurs when the 
lining of the airways in the lungs become “swollen or inflamed 
and thicker mucus – more than normal – is produced.” An un-treated attack can eventually mean death from suffocation.
If Michael’s mother hadn’t been able to get to the school in 
time, he could have died because of a legal technicality.
In these cases, we encourage school administrators to use 
common sense. We hope if school policies exist for these situa-
tions that nurses are properly informed of them.
If procedures do not exist for these emergency situations, 
it is imperative that they are adopted. There is no reason that 
children have to suffer or die while under the care of school of-ficials because of a pure lack of common sense.In a gentle act of kindness from the universe, I turned 
21 last week. This fall signals the beginning of my last year here at UF.
These two facts probably make it seem like I should 
be good friends with the nice people at Livers’R’Us or that I’m some kind of professional at sneaking and sip-ping booze whenever possible.
That’s not the case.If I were on MTV, my episode would be titled “True 
Life: I’ve Never Had A Drink.”
Does this make me better than people who do drink? 
Not at all.
It does make me safer, however.On average, more than 10,000 people will die this 
year in drunken driving vehicle crashes. That’s about one every 50 minutes.
Two years ago, 52,346 people were arrested for driv-
ing under the influence in the state of Florida alone.
Obviously, we’ve all heard the lectures: Everything 
in moderation, don’t drink and drive, just say “no.”
Those lessons are the first ones to fly out the window 
if they try to come between a college student and his or her fun.
I don’t tell my friends how to live their lives; I’ll ac-
cept everyone for who they are and what they do. But 
there’s an unhealthy need to fit in with our peers that I 
think could drive some people crazy.
By all means, please, have fun! Enjoy yourselves! 
We’re all “fine, fresh, fierce,” as the song goes.
I want you to know that it’s possible to have fun 
without damaging or bringing potential danger to your -
selves.
I’m not asking people to abandon their way of life. 
Just examine your choices to see if they make sense.
A big part of why I don’t drink is my size. I’m ex-
tremely petite. It would more than likely take even less than one drink to put me over the edge of tipsy.Call me a control freak, but I 
like to have full awareness over myself and my circumstances. 
There’s no need to leave any of 
that up to chance.
But it doesn’t matter what I 
think, right? I’m one very small 
person in one very large world. 
I completely understand that 
people make mistakes; I also understand that we are supposed to learn from them.
For example, I can tell you for sure that I won’t be a 
mathematician. I know because I’ve learned from the two decades of my life that I’ve spent suffering in al-most every math course I’ve been forced to take.
I know I’m not going to be a judge on cooking com-
petition shows such as “Iron Chef” because I gave up eating meat nearly eight years ago.
However, I do know that for all of those math classes 
that I toiled through, I found where my strengths were located.
It wasn’t until my journalism courses here at UF that 
I could begin to make out what direction my life would go.
And while I may be missing out on all the meat or 
alcohol the world has to offer, at least I know I’m doing my part in setting an example for future generations.
That is, unless we don’t find a way to sustain our -
selves and there ends up being not many more future generations after all.
I’ve learned from my own mistakes as well as mis-
takes made by others. Don’t feel obligated to start imi-tating everything that I do, though.
I watch an awful lot of reality TV on Bravo.

Letter to the Editor
UF should take caution when using 
drone technology
UF is proudly and rightly hailed as a top 
technology school in the United States.
It should come as no surprise that re-
searchers here are at the forefront of devel-oping Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs or drones) for military and civilian applica-
tions.What might come as a surprise is that the 
University Police Department is also at the 
forefront of deploying drone technology as evidenced by UF’s appearance on a list of the Federal Aviation Administration’s drone certiﬁ  cates released by the Electronic Fron-tier Foundation.
As an engineer, I understand that surveil-
lance technologies can be put to great use here in the U.S. — surveying, trafﬁ  c control and emergency management are among them.
But as a citizen, I also know that an excel-
lent tool can be put to other uses, sometimes far more sinister. I read an opinion by Dyl-lan Furness in the Alligator highlighting the Fourth Amendment protections which could be put in danger with UAV technologies.I agree wholeheartedly that we in 
Gainesville need to approach deployment of UAVs with security, safety and civil liberties squarely in mind. The capability to misuse and abuse drones in Gainesville skies is just too great.

On Friday , President Barack Obama announced 
that the U.S. government would grant work per-mits and halt the deportation of about 800,000 
dreamers.
A dreamer is a child of an undocumented or illegal 
immigrant between 12 and 30 who was brought to the U.S. under the age of 16 and has lived here for more than ﬁ  ve years.
Throughout their whole lives they have been look-
ing over their shoulders with the fear of deportation. Many of them have not had the chance to obtain U.S. citizenship.
The president’s move last week changed every-
thing.
Obama’s executive order could be called “The 
DREAM Act for Beginners” because it doesn’t encom-pass the full proposal of the DREAM Act.
The full version of the DREAM Act would allow 
these so-called dreamers to potentially gain U.S. citizen-ship once they have either served two years in the armed services or gone to an institution of higher learning.
This latest executive order doesn’t give them amnes-
ty nor does it map out the way to citizenship. However, 
it does constitute a step toward future victories.
Obama’s decision to allow these dreamers to con-
tinue their lives in the U.S. is not a coincidence.  Con-
troversial stances taken by prominent leaders are rarely reached by accident.
Dreamers have been some of the hardest and most 
dedicated activists I’ve had the pleasure of working with. They have held countless call-ins, rallies and dem-onstrations. They have refused to remain in the shadows 
and have marched forward ﬁ  ghting for their freedom.
There’s an important lesson to learn from their per-
sistence and passion: Activism works.
This move is quite a shift from the president’s pre-
vious immigration policies; Obama has deported more 
immigrants than any other president has in the past 60 years.More than 1.1 mil-
lion immigrants have been forced to leave our shores.
Faced with a govern-
ment bent on getting rid of them, the dreamers didn’t shy away from the battle. They brought their megaphones and their 
best chants. They organized and kept going despite all odds against them.
It wasn’t a ﬂ  uke that Obama granted the dreamers 
the freedom they deserve. It was their hard work and 
organizational skills. Movements aren’t spontaneous; 
they are carefully planned and worked on until every detail is hammered out. Time and effort goes into every facet of a demonstration.
The role of an activist is never easy. You are con-
stantly faced with political repression and threats to your personal life.
Yet the importance of the cause is stronger than any 
perception of personal safety. The call to action reso-
nates within, and you are ready to march with the hun-
dreds of others who have woken up.
Their victory is an inspiration for any group current-
ly living under oppression. Their triumph is one step forward toward equality throughout the nation.
Their hard work paid off and continues to prove that 
taking to the streets and ﬁ  ghting for what’s right does make a difference.
The dreamers still have a long road ahead as they 
continue to organize and work for their citizenship.
But every step forward is monumental and deserves 
to be celebrated. I salute all the dreamers and raise my ﬁ  st in solidarity . Keep up the good work and onward to victory!

opinions@alligator.org Speaker of the House John 
Boehner is committed to “repealing Obamacare in 
its entirety,” stating that “any-thing short of that is unaccept-
able.” While the American pub-
lic remains divided on the issue, the Republican Party is not. The rhetoric that comes from the 
political right when it comes to 
most controversial parts of the 
Affordable Care Act and the in-dividual mandate has remained strict and ﬁ  erce. Conservative 
think tanks in this country have 
consistently called the mandate 
everything from “socialized medicine” to “a cancer,” while the conservative politicians on the other hand prefer the name “Obamacare.” Regardless of the name used, one thing is certainly clear: Conservatives do not like the idea of the indi-vidual mandate. It works like this — the federal government will subsidize us to participate in private health insurance markets known as “exchang-es,” and in these exchanges the insurers will not be able to dis-criminate based on pre-existing conditions.
Individuals can opt not to 
buy insurance, but they will 
have to pay a ﬁ  ne. To keep the premium cost down, the government would equate the size of the subsidy to the sec-ond-least expensive plan in the 
market, which is considered 
competitive bidding to encour-age people to go with cheaper plans. That sounds like a pretty good idea to me and a conser-vative one as well. After all, it is the same plan Republican pres-idential nominee Mitt Romney implemented as governor of 
Massachusetts.
I understand it is one thing to 
implement a health care reform 
plan like this in one state, and it’s a completely different story to implement something like this nationwide. Even though Romney has pandered so far to the right during the Republican 
primary in order to court the 
conservative wing of the Repub-lican party , I can understand the argument that he had to im-plement a healthcare plan like his to ﬁ  x the failed health care system in the liberal state of Massa-
chusetts.
But is there a difference if 
the same plan is applied fed-erally but only to Americans 65 and up? Well, Republican congressman and chairman of the House Budget Committee Paul Ryan seems to think so, considering his plan to “ﬁ  x” 
Medicare is very similar, if not 
the exact same as the individual mandate, with the exception of the fact that it doesn’t actually grant coverage like the ACA would. Just ask Boehner, who 
said of Ryan’s Medicare plan 
last year, “It transforms Medi-care into a plan that’s very similar to the president’s own health care bill.”
There are some parts of 
the ACA that Republicans are actually OK with, like young adults being able to stay on 
their parents’ health care plan 
until the age of 26 and not al-lowing insurance companies to deny coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions, but is affording all of that pos-sible without the individual mandate? If the Supreme Court strikes down the individual 
mandate for forcing Americans 
to purchase health insurance in a private market, they won’t look too favorably on Republi-can demands that Americans do the same for Medicare. If that’s not ironic enough, I have a better one. The Supreme Court has already ruled that the social 
security mandate is constitu-
tional, a single-payer system for healthcare that is similar to the way Medicare works now, which was actually what most liberals would prefer as com-pared to the individual man-date, and this would deﬁ  nitely be constitutional.
The conservative dream of 
privatizing Social Security and Medicare would not be con-stitutional, so conservatives should think twice before call-ing for things like “repealing Obamacare in its entirety.”

Will Mazzota sets simple goals.
Graduate in May 2013. Serve as treasurer of UF 
College Democrats for the 2012-2013 academic year. Become a state senator.   
The 21-year-old environmental science and politi-
cal science senior officially entered the Florida Senate race on June 8 as the Democratic candidate for District 7.
District 7 consists of Alachua, Bradford and Clay 
counties.  
The election will take place on Nov. 6.
Mazzota is running against Republican Rob Brad-
ley, a former criminal prosecutor and managing part-
ner of Orange Park law firm Kopelousos and Bradley, 
P .A. Bradley announced his candidacy for the seat on 
Jan. 24.  
Although Bradley is currently a Clay County resi-
dent, he received a degree in telecommunication and a juris doctorate from UF.
“I will be UF’s biggest advocate in Tallahassee,” 
Bradley said.
The current senator representing Alachua County 
and the surrounding area is Republican Sen. Steve Oelrich. Oelrich is vacating his seat to run against Rep. 
Cliff Stearns for a congressional seat in Washington.
Because he lives in Alachua County, Mazzota said 
he understands the vital interests of the Gainesville area, primarily those of UF and Shands at UF, and will 
represent those interests best in Tallahassee.
Having easy access to students could be an advan-
tage for Mazzotta, said UF Student Government Sen-ate President Pro Tempore Logan Harrison.
“I’m excited to see students go out and make [the] 
change they wanted to see,” he said.

About 70 children lined the edge of the H. 
Spurgeon Cherry Municipal Pool’s shallow end 
Thursday morning.
With five minutes to go, children kicked and 
splashed the water in excitement.
At 11 a.m., the sound of an air horn sliced 
through the air as the children and swim instruc-
tors jumped into the pool. They hoped to earn a 
spot in the Guinness World Records along with other swimming facilities and participants world-wide for the world’s largest swimming lesson.
Recreation supervisor Jeff Moffitt, 43, said 
Thursday’s event was Gainesville’s second year participating in the world record attempt.
Last year, more than 20,000 people from about 
300 facilities in 14 countries, including 45 states in 
the United States, broke the world record by giv-
ing a swimming lesson at the exact same time.
On Thursday, the World’s Largest Swimming 
Lesson organization attempted to break that re-cord once again.
The organization is collecting information 
from other swimming facilities worldwide to determine if the record was broken, according to the organization’s website.
Moffitt said the main goal, however, was to 
raise awareness for water safety and swimming 
lessons.
According to the group’s website, drowning 
is the second leading cause of accidental death in 
children younger than 14, a statistic Moffitt said 
is “totally preventable.”
“There should be no reason why we can’t pre-
pare these children to be able to prevent drown-
ings,” he said. “Swim lessons are extremely im-portant, especially here in Florida where we’re surrounded by water.”
For 45 minutes, swim instructors led students, ranging from infants to several adults, in a con-densed swimming lesson, which included basic strokes, breathing while swimming, and safely 
entering and exiting the pool.
“The more people we can get into the water 
learning, the less people will drown,” said Tyler 
Marzella, a 22-year-old agricultural operations 
management senior at UF and a swim instructor 
on site.
While students practiced leg kicks and blow-
ing bubbles underwater, parents watched pool-side.
Regina Peterson, 51, could not stop smiling as 
she watched her eight grandchildren participate in their first swimming lesson.
Financial and time difficulties prevented her 
grandchildren from learning how to swim, she said. But Thursday’s event gave them a chance to 
learn basic swimming skills.
“I’m glad they are part of it,” she said. “They 
need to know how to swim.”
The lessons also helped Peterson’s 9-year-old 
granddaughter, Lejuiana Cason, overcome her fear of getting in the water.
“She would just stand there, and she’s like, 
‘I’m not going in no water,’” Peterson said.
Seeing her brothers and sisters splash around 
in the pool, Lejuiana worked up the courage to 
jump in, submerge herself in the water and swim with her instructors. She finally faced her fear.
“It’s encouraging,” Peterson said. “It’s letting 
them know [the water] is nothing to be afraid of. Taking away the fright, it’s good.”

A family spent Father’s Day 
in jail together after they beat 
up a Gainesville man.
Thomas Davis and his two 
sons, Randall Davis and Rob-
ert Davis, were all arrested on 
charges of obstructing justice and aggravated battery. Thom-as Davis’ wife, Richelle Davis, was arrested on charges of ob-structing justice and battery.
William Croft, 48, called 
police hours before about a domestic disturbance between 
his neighbors, Robert Davis, 21, 
and his wife, Cecelia Davis, 19.
The Davis family was upset 
with Croft for calling the police on Robert Davis and Cecelia Davis, according to a witness’s statement in an Alachua Coun-ty Sheriff’s Office arrest report.
Richelle Davis, 45, went to 
Croft’s house and argued with 
him about his call to the police.
During the argument, 
Richelle Davis knocked Croft, 
who was drunk, to the ground with a “chest bump,” according to the report.
While Croft was on the 
ground Richelle Davis yelled, “He hit me,” which caused the Davises to run over to Croft’s from Randall Davis’ house.
Robert Davis punched Croft 
in the face multiple times as he lay on the ground.
Thomas Davis, 45, then 
kicked Croft in his groin as Ran-
dall Davis, 23, kicked him in the head once.
Accord-
ing to the re-port, police found Croft on his side between two 
blood-smeared cars.
He had spit out a pool of 
blood beneath his face.
Despite blood loss and mul-
tiple cuts on his mouth, face and head, Croft was able to say that he wanted to press charges.

 The Gators’ untimely demise at this 
year’s College World Series was un-expected to say the least.
However, a late move by coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan in Florida’s 5-4 loss to Kent State seemed less likely than UF going two and out in Omaha.
  Trailing by one run in the top of the 
ninth, the Gators had put runners on ﬁ  rst 
and second for All-American designated 
hitter Brian Johnson.
  Johnson had struggled in Omaha up to 
that point with just one hit in eight at-bats to go along with a dismal performance on 
the mound in Saturday’s 7-3 loss to South 
Carolina. 
After his early struggles, Johnson had 
a chance to redeem himself with the go-
ahead run on ﬁ  rst base.
  However, O’Sullivan never gave the  left-handed junior the chance to reverse 
his fortunes.
  Instead of letting his cleanup hitter, a 
ﬁ  rst-round pick in this year’s MLB Ama-
teur Draft, hit with the season on the line 
in the ninth inning of an elimination game in Omaha, O’Sullivan called for a pinch hitter.
  The guy picking up the bat: Cody 
Dent.
  Here’s a quick history lesson. Dent was 
named to the College World Series All-Tournament Team last season after hitting 
at a .286 (4 for 14) clip during the Gators’ 
stay in Omaha.
This season, however, his charm wore 
off.
  Dent batted just .134 during the regu-
lar season and struck out 22 times in 82 at-bats. During Josh 
Tobias’ long midseason ab-
sence from the 
starting lineup due to a broken hamate bone in 
his hand, Dent 
often looked 
lost at the plate.
  Going back to Monday, O’Sullivan de-
cided to bench a guy with a .307 batting 
average and 41 RBI for Dent in a one-run 
game in the top of the ninth with runners 
on ﬁ  rst and second.
  Here is the most puzzling development: 
O’Sullivan had Dent bunt.
  “I bunted [Dent] because I didn’t want 
to hit into a double play,” O’Sullivan said of his decision.
  To be fair, I value bunting as an integral 
component of manufacturing runs. You 
may be giving away an out, but the value 
of a base hit skyrockets with a guy in scor-
ing position as opposed to ﬁ  rst base.
  But when you’re three outs away from 
elimination in the College World Series, you cannot afford to give outs away. It is 
borderline reckless.
  Johnson’s struggles at the plate during 
this season’s College World Series were 
clear. He had stranded eight runners on 
base, and his double play in the seventh 
inning killed arguably Florida’s best rally Monday.
  However, the ninth inning of an elimi-
nation game in Omaha is a situation where

 The Gators were the last team to leave 
Omaha disappointed in 2011. In 2012, they 
are one of the ﬁ  rst.
  Top-ranked Florida (47-20) will leave 
the College World Series winless after a 5-4 loss to Kent State (47-19) in an elimination game Monday.
  “I’ve been able to make it out here three 
times and all three times I’ve been just as disappointed,” UF catcher Mike Zunino said. “It’s one of those things where you don’t want it to end.”
  Errors proved costly for the Gators 
during this year’s stay in Omaha. They committed ﬁ  ve ﬁ  elding miscues in just two games, including two early mistakes 
against the Golden Flashes.
  In the bottom of the ﬁ  rst, a throwing 
error by Florida shortstop Nolan Fontana 
allowed Kent State’s Jimmy Rider to reach base with one out. Rider eventually scored 
an unearned run to put the Gators in a 1-0 
hole.
  Making matters worse for Florida head-
ing into the bottom of the second was the 
abrupt exit of starter Hudson Randall (9-3). 
Randall, who took the loss for the Gators, left the game after the ﬁ  rst frame due to heat-related issues.
  “I could tell he was laboring a little 
bit,” Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I went out there just to give him a little breather to catch his breath. Then when I went out there, it was obvious he was hav-ing a little trouble breathing.”
  Crawford came on in relief in the bot-
tom of the second, but the defense behind him was not much improved.
  After Crawford surrendered a leadoff 
single to Golden Flashes’ designated hitter Jason Bagoly, Alex Miklos reached base on a ﬁ  elding error by UF third baseman Josh Tobias. Spurred by the Tobias error, Kent 
State plated three more unearned runs in 
the second frame.
  “We made three errors the ﬁ  rst night, 
we made two today, and they ended 
up coming back to haunt us a little bit,” 
O’Sullivan said.
  Florida’s defensive mistakes Monday 
came on the heels of a three-error perfor-
mance in a 7-3 loss to South Carolina on 
Saturday. Trailing 5-3 headed into the top of ninth, the Gators sent Steven “Paco” Ro-driguez to the mound.
  The Gamecocks scored twice in the 
frame to double their lead to four as a re-sult of three miscues: a wild pitch by Ro-driguez, a Rodriguez throwing error and 
another throwing error by ﬁ  rst baseman Gators mistakes prove costly in 
early College World Series exit 
“We made three errors the ﬁ  rst 
night, we made two today, and they 
ended upcoming back to haunt us a 
little bit.”

MIAMI — LeBron James ar -
rived for practice Monday wearing lime-green sneakers, a highly fluo-rescent shade.
It was the fashion statement 
du jour for the league’s three-time MVP , much like the eyeglass frames he’s been sporting after games throughout this postseason. 
But those sneakers probably 
would have remained tucked away in the drawer beneath his locker during last year’s NBA Fi-nals, since very little about James’ game would be considered glow-ing or luminous during those two weeks.
Different year, different story.For the second straight season, 
the Miami Heat held a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals. There’s a glaring difference this time around — that being James is playing at the top of his game. And he’ll try to help the Heat move within one win of a championship on Tuesday night, when Miami plays host to the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 4 of this title series.
“We’re a totally different team 
than we was last year when we 
was up 2-1,” James said Monday. 
“We’re a totally different team. We 
understand what it takes to win, 
we’ve used that motivation, and 
we will continue to use that mo-
tivation. But last year is last year, and we’re not going into a Game 4 
on someone else’s floor. We’re go-
ing into a Game 4 on our floor with 
a lot of experience in this type of 
situation. We’ll be ready. We love the challenge.”
Miami lost Game 4 in Dallas 
last year, the start of a three-game 
slide that ended with the Maver -
icks hoisting the title trophy.
So the Thunder know a 2-1 defi-
cit in a series is hardly insurmount-
able, even though the home-court 
roles are reversed this time around. 
And if Oklahoma City needed more proof, all the Thunder need 
do is remember the Western Con-
ference finals when they lost the 
first two games to San Antonio, becoming the 19th and 20th entries 
on the Spurs’ incredible winning streak. The Spurs didn’t win an-other game the rest of the way.
“We were down 2-0 against San 
Antonio and everybody thought the series was over,” Thunder coach Scott Brooks said. “But I know our guys, they’re very com -
petitive, they’re 
very resilient. They’ve always showed that type of effort every game, and we’ve always been a great bounce-back team. I 
thought last night was a great bounce-back last night. It’s unfor -
tunate we didn’t make a couple plays, and uncharacteristic, also.”
Uncharacteristic. That would 
also be a fine word to describe how James played in the finals last sea-son.
He freely acknowledges that 
he “didn’t make enough plays” against the Mavericks a year ago, and the numbers — 17.8 points, 7.2 rebounds and 6.8 assists per game — back that up, as do his well-chronicled fourth quarter struggles in that series. So far in this year’s finals, James is averag-ing 30.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 4 assists, and in the final minutes of Miami’s two wins in the series he’s done his part to slam the door on the Thunder.
“He’s been aggressive. He’s an 
aggressive player,” Thunder guard James Harden said. “He’s been ag-gressive all year, all postseason. He’s tall, strong, and physical. He’s a tough matchup. It takes five guys to really lock down on their offense because they’re a very of-fensive team especially with LeB-ron and (Dwyane) Wade.”
James is shooting 46 percent in 
the series, not even close to the 57 percent clip Kevin Durant is put-ting up for Oklahoma City. But here’s maybe one piece of proof to support that aggression notion Harden was speaking of — James is 25 for 29 from the foul line in the three games, while Durant is just 
14 for 19 so far in the series.
James has done much of his 
work near the rim in these finals. 
But while it wasn’t his most memo -
rable shot, perhaps the biggest one 
he hit all night in Miami’s Game 3 
victory  was a 3-pointer late in the 
third quarter, one of just five shots 
that the Heat made from outside 
the paint in that game. That shot 
put Miami up entering the fourth, 
and seemed to extend the Thun-
der defense just enough to allow James, Wade and Chris Bosh to create more in the lane late.
“The biggest evolution of great 
players is they always stay in con-stant state of being uncomfort-able,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. “They don’t stay satisfied. 
And LeBron every summer has 
added something to his game. I’ve 
seen it when I’ve followed him from afar, and now that I’ve got-ten to know him he’s added two, 
three, four different elements now 
to his game, the well-documented 
one of the post-up game, which we needed. But he continues to try to improve and stay uncomfortable. I 
think that’s a sign of greatness.”THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Florida’s Bradley 
Beal and Kentucky’s Michael Kidd-Gilchrist worked out for the Charlotte Bobcats on Monday morning as the team continued evaluations for the June 28 NBA Draft.
The Bobcats own the second pick in the 
draft, and are considering several options on the assumption that the New Orleans Hor -
nets will take Kentucky’s Anthony Davis first.
Beal, a 6-foot-3 guard, said it was the 
perfect workout for contrasting his offen-sive skills against Kidd-Gilchrist’s defensive prowess.
“It really was,” Beal said. “We both got 
after it, on both ends, even my defense and his offense. We’re just competitors and we both went at it today.
“It was cool. We were laughing and joking 
around, but competing at the same time.”
The Bobcats also worked out potential 
second-round picks Quincy Acy of Baylor, Bernard James of Florida State and Kris Jo-seph of Syracuse. Kansas’ Thomas Robinson and North Carolina’s Harrison Barnes have not worked out for the team yet.
Owner Michael Jordan, president of bas-
ketball operations Rod Higgins and general manager Rich Cho watched the workouts, but none commented afterward.
The Bobcats are still without a head coach 
after firing Paul Silas at the end of a 7-59 sea-son, the worst season in NBA history.
Beal averaged 14.8 points in 37 games as 
a freshman at Florida last season, earning first-team All-Southeastern Conference and SEC All-Freshman honors. He also averaged 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists.
Some have compared him to Boston’s Ray 
Allen because of his range and ability to cre-ate. NBA scouts also love his high basketball IQ, his fundamentals, his physical strength, and his rebounding ability for his size. He led all guards in the six major conferences in rebounding.
Beal has previously worked out for Wash-
ington and Cleveland, who own the Nos. 3 and 4 picks, and said he would not work out for any other teams.
“My agent and I have discussed that,” 
Beal said. “Everybody’s pretty much telling me I won’t go any lower than that (No. 4) so I just limited myself to where I fit in best.”
Kidd-Gilchrist averaged 11.9 points, 7.4 
rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1 steal in 40 games as a freshman for Kentucky’s national cham-pions. He was chosen the South Region’s Most Outstanding Player during the Wild-cats’ march to the title.
NBA scouts love his strength, toughness, 
heart and energy, particularly at the defen-sive end.
Kidd-Gilchrist took a spill during the 
workout and tweaked his back, but said he was fine afterward. He was to fly on to Cleveland and has already worked out for Washington.
“It’s all about heart to me,” he said. “Heart 
and winning basketball games. That’s what I’m all about. It went good today. I’m a win-ner, and I showed them that today.”
Both said they were not intimidated by 
Jordan’s presence, but were honored to work out for him.
“I played in his high school game like a 
year and a half ago, so I was kind of used to seeing him sitting over there,” Beal said. “But of course, when you see him walking in it’s like, ‘Oh, that’s Mike.’ But at the same time, when you’re working out he’s just an-other person in the gym. I talked to him a little bit and he said ‘Good job’ and I’ll talk to him soon I guess.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 19, 2012

track record has to count for something.
In 10 career postseason games, Johnson has hit .368 
with one home run and nine RBI. Johnson has proven 
himself in the past and he should have been given the 
chance to do it again.
If I am O’Sullivan in that situation, the prospect of 
Brian Johnson coming to the plate with the go-ahead run 
on base is exciting.
  Florida’s early exit from the College World Series can-
not be pinned solely on O’Sullivan’s decision to have Dent bunt instead of Johnson swing away in the ninth inning of Monday’s loss. I do not believe that to be the 
case, and for anyone that does, go back and watch both 
games again.
  While the play ultimately worked out the way 
O’Sullivan planned, it was a questionable move in Flor-
ida’s mistake-ﬁ  lled stay in Omaha. Ultimately, it will be 
forgotten.
  But with a shot at a national championship on the line, 
benching one of the guys O’Sullivan claims “set a stan-dard” at UF was the wrong move.
  Johnson has been an integral part of the Gators’ suc-
cess the last three seasons. At the very least, he deserved a chance to make something happen.

  Freshman Justin Shafer walks off the ﬁ  eld in dismay after dropping two straight games and failing to advance in the 
2012 CWS. He went 2 for 5 with one RBI and stranded four runners on base in a 5-4 loss to Kent State on Monday.

Mike Holloway was announced as the 2012 U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association National Men’s Outdoor Coach of the Year. The 
nod comes after Holloway led the Gators to their first NCAA Outdoor title. Earlier in the year he was announced as the USTFCCCA National Men’s Indoor Coach of the Year. Although he’s won the USTFCCCA award for the last three years after leading Florida to three straight indoor titles, this is the first time he has won the outdoor honor. Holloway will now focus on coaching the sprints and hurdles for Team USA at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
Leading Factors 
• Florida accumulated nine wins at the Florida 
Relays during the outdoor season:Lorraine Graham (long jump), Stipe Zunic (jave-lin), Marquis Dendy (long jump), Tony McQuay (400 meters), Jeff Demps (100 meters), Agata Strausa (steeplechase), Josh Izewski (5,000 me-ters), women’s 1,600 meter sprint medley relay and women’s 4x800 meter relay.• The Gators followed up their Florida Relay performance with 12 wins at the Tom Jones Classic:Jeremy Postin (hammer throw), Stipe Zunic (jav-elin), Taylor Burke (high jump), Keely Medeiros (shot put), Marquis Dendy (triple jump), JL Hines (3,000 meters), Jeff Demps (100 meters), Cory McGee (800 meters), Genevieve LaCaze (1,500 meters), men’s 4x100 meter relay and men and women’s 4x400 meter relay.• Holloway coached the men to an overall fourth-place finish at the Southeastern Conference Championships and six indi-vidual SEC titles:Jeremy Postin (hammer throw), Dwight Barbiasz (high jump), Omar Craddock (triple jump), Stipe Zunic (javelin), Tony Mc-Quay (400 meters) and 4x400 meter relay.
• The men qualified for the NCAA Outdoor Championships in nine individual events.• Florida won three individual events at the NCAA Out-door Championships; all of which came from the men: 
Tony McQuay (400 meters), Omar Craddock (triple jump) 
and men’s 4x400 meter relay.• Holloway led the men to both an indoor and outdoor NCAA title in 2012:
The Gators are the first team to accomplish this since 2003 
when Arkansas grabbed both titles. Florida is one of six 
schools to win both men titles in the same year.“I bunted [Dent] because I didn’t want to hit 
into a double play.”

“Very sloppy on defense, espe-
cially late in the game,” UF assis-
tant coach Brad Weitzel said Sat-
urday. “We still [had] a chance, we [were] two runs down.”
While defense played a role in 
Florida’s early exit from Omaha, its inability to take advantage of scoring opportunities proved costly. The Gators put the leadoff man on base 11 times in 18 in-
nings during the College World 
Series. 
However, UF only scored runs 
in four of those 11 frames.
Against Kent State, Florida 
loaded the bases in the seventh 
and ninth in-nings. Trailing 
by three runs, 
the Gators put 
their first three runners on in the seventh in-
ning.
Zunino sin-
gled up the middle to cut the 
deficit to two for designated hit-ter Brian Johnson. With perhaps 
Florida’s best chance at a rally at 
stake, Johnson plated a run but at the cost of hitting into a 4-6-3 double play.
It was the last run the Gators 
scored Monday.
“Our team battled through 
some adversity today, and I thought they did a nice job bat-tling back in the middle innings,” 
O’Sullivan said.
In the ninth inning, UF second 
baseman Casey Turgeon stepped 
up to the plate with the bases loaded and one out. Facing a 3-1 
count, Turgeon took a pitch out-
side he believed to be a ball. It was called a strike.
On the next pitch, a Turgeon 
check swing on a ball outside sent him to the dugout. Left fielder Justin Shafer flew out to right field for the final out of the 
Gators’ season.
“My first gut instinct (on Tur -
geon’s check swing) was hoping 
it was going to be ball four,” said Zunino, who was on second base during the at-bat.
“[Kent State] appealed, and it 
wasn’t.  I thought the umpire did a great job the whole game.  So I thought they were good calls.”
Monday’s defeat was likely the final time Florida’s nine MLB 
draft prospects will play together 
under O’Sullivan. Ten of the 20 players to suit-up in the CWS did so for the final time in a Gators uniform. 
“In the end, it’s just another ball game,” Tucker said. “But it’s 
my last, and obviously, I’m not 
going to get another chance.”
