Students discuss demands
They spoke at a private meeting
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Behind closed doors, Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs Patricia
Telles-Irvin met with members of
the Coalition for Justice Against Po-
lice Brutality Tuesday afternoon to
discuss the demands the coalition
made at last week's rally protesting
the University Police Department
shooting of UF graduate studentKofi Adu-Brempong.
After the meeting, Telles-Irvin
said the administration is waiting
for the results from the shooting
investigation before tak-
peCai ing anymore action.Report_ She also said she re-
assured the students
that their opinions will be treated
fairly, and she offered to meet with
them again.
The coalition's demands includedropping all charges against Adu-
Brempong, implementing an in-
dependent review board for UPD
consisting of students, faculty, com-
munity members and coalition mem-
bers, and improving mental health
and crisis services on campus.
Coalition member Fernando
Figueroa said the group felt the
meeting was inconclusive.
"We came with many questions,
and we leave with more questions,"
he said.

were supporters of
LGBT rights. Par-

the Defense of Mar-

5,000 gather
for SNL star
By MICHELLE PROFIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andy Samberg is a Nigerian prince.
Or at least that's what he said Tuesday night at the
O'Connell Center when asked to share something the
audience of about 5,000 wouldn't already know.
The Emmy award-winning writer and Saturday
Night Live comedian is also a member of Lonely Is-
land, the musical comedy group
responsible for penning the You-
Tube sensation "I'm On A Boat."
Samberg was interviewed by-
College of Journalism professor
Mike Foley.
When Foley asked Samberg
how Jewish he is, Samberg joked,
Samberg "On a scale of Hitler to Moses? I'd
probably say I'm somewhere be-
tween Larry David and Steven Spielberg."
Accent Speakers Bureau and Jewish Awareness
Month sponsored the event. Samberg was paid
$72,000, according to Student Government Finance
records. According to Accent, Samberg said he did
not want any photographs taken of him at the event.

the hearts of his students and
colleagues.
Lewis, who teaches ethics
and editing in the College of
Journalism and Communica-

of the Year for 2009 to 2010.
Each college nominated a
member of the faculty and sent
letters of recommendation and
evaluations from students and
colleagues to the Office of the
Provost, which made the final
selection.
"It's a terrific honor that's re-

said."I've just been really
fortunate to be in the

Former Navy Seal to speak
on campus
Eric Greitens wants to chal-
lenge students to serve their
communities by helping those
who have already served their
country.
Greitens, a former U.S. Navy
Seal, will speak tonight in theBob Graham Center for Public
Service.
"Eric Greitens: A Different
Kind of Service" begins at 7
p.m. and is free and open to
the public, according to Vicki
Gervickas, Graham Center
spokeswoman.
Greitens co-founded The
Mission Continues, a nonprof-
it organization dedicated to
matching veterans with three-
month volunteer fellowships
in the community.
"We try to partner them
with an objective that is ap-
pealing to them, something
they can believe in," said John
Roy, the central Florida out-
reach coordinator for The Mis-
sion Continues.
Roy said volunteers are
needed for tribute projects,
which commemorate someone
who has devoted his or her life
to service.
Although Greitens is con-
stantly changing his presenta-
tions, he said the event will be
directed toward student vol-
unteer opportunities.
Roy said Greitens' project is
needed because veterans who
voluntarily agreed to serve
their country really struggle to
adjust when they are injured.
Their goal to continue to serve
hasn't changed, he said.
"The real story is helping
wounded and disabled veter-
ans transition," he said.

Comedian hypnotizes six
-v. n. """'/ """"""u -11"
Sailesh, a hypnotist and comedian, speaks to hypnotized students. An audience of about
35 watched as volunteers were hypnotized in the Reitz Union Auditorium Tuesday night.CJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Under normal circumstances, a trip to
outer space would require years of scien-
tific training and expensive equipment.
For Sailesh the Hypnotist, it only takes
one touch of the arm and a few words.
Sailesh, who was named the "Best
Hypnotist on the Planet" by MTV Eu-
rope, performed in front of an audience
of about 30 people Tuesday at the Reitz
Union Auditorium.
Sailesh placed members of the audi-
ence under a hypnotic trance by doing
controlled breathing exercises and light-
ly touching them on the arm.
He also incorporated humor into his
performances.
The volunteers acted out scenarios,
such as watching television and flying in
a space shuttle. Sailesh was even able to
convince one volunteer that his belt was
something to be afraid of. Sailesh grabbed
the belt and flipped it around. As the belt
moved, the volunteer switched from be-
ing calm to being fearful.
For Sailesh, who was first introduced
to hypnotism when he was 20, hypnotismacts as a natural sort of therapy. Accord-
ing to Sailesh, the average student falls
under a hypnotic trance 112 times in the
average day.
Since August 1, Sailesh has per-
formed about 140 times and has 60 more
booked.
"It's the most fun you will have
with your clothes on."
Sailesh
hypnotist
A portion of proceeds raised from the
show go toward Vitamin Angels, a char-
ity that aims to combat child mortality
worldwide.
From his performances, he hopes to
be able to raise enough money to help
100,000 children, primarily those in Af-
rica.
He has also used his talent to help
people with ailments such as chronic
back pain and chronic headaches.
But he still manages to keep the shows
lighthearted.
"It's the most fun you will have with
your clothes on," he said.
Same-sex couples tie knot
0 THE MOCK CEREMONY
PROMOTED LGBT RIGHTS.
By EMILY MORROW
Alligator Contributing Writer
Amanda married Ben, Bennett mar-
ried Craig, and Amy married Christina.
The couples exchanged Ring Pops,
not diamonds, and Hershey's Kisses
rather than real smooches.
UF Levin College of Law students
gathered from noon to 2 p.m. for a
"marry in" to protest the Defense of
Marriage Act -an event sponsored by
the student organization Outlaw.
In 1996, the Defense of Marriage
Act was passed, defining marriage as
a union strictly between a man and a
woman.
Outlaw is a UF student group that
works to inform people about the legal
issues faced by members of the lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender commu-
nity.
Participants were able to symbolically
get married and sign petitions that will
be sent to Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla.,and Bill Nelson, D-Fla., in hopes that the
Defense of Marriage Act will come to a
revote and eventually be repealed.
Amy Levenberg, a first-year law stu-
dent and vice president of Outlaw, said
she thinks the bill is hateful and goes
against the American value of equality.
Levenberg "married" Christina Vilas-
eca, also a first-year law student.
"We're actually on our honeymoon
now," Vilaseca said jokingly.
Karen Middlekauff, a first-year law
student and president of
On Outlaw, said the organiza-Campus tion married about 40 cou-
ples during the two-hour
event.
She said about 20 of the couples were
same-sex, while the others were hetero-
sexual couples or friends who wanted to
show their support.
One heterosexual couple celebrated
their anniversary by getting "married."
Bennett Ostroff, a second-year law
student, said he is heterosexual but
married his friend Craig Cox to show
his support.
"I really believe that homophobia is
the new racism," Ostroff said.Lewis was a journalist for 25 years
AWAR D, from page 1
Lewis.
McKeen said Lewis is very popular with
his students and his colleagues.
Lewis' years of experience in journalism
help make him a strong professor, he said.
"I never hear anything but praise for
Norman," he said.
Lewis worked as a journalist and editor
for 25 years before going into teaching.
He lived in seven different states and
worked at publications such as The Wash-
ington Post.
Lewis received his Ph.D. in journalism
from the University of Maryland in 2007.
His thesis discussed plagiarism.
As a professor, Lewis said he tries to
present his students with ethical dilemmas
they might face during their journalism ca-
reers.
"I try to make it as practical as I can,"
Lewis said. "It's practical ethics, not phi-
losophy."Lewis wants to help students like his col-
lege adviser helped him and point them in
the right direction on their career path.
"I want you, as my student, to be the
best you possibly can," Lewis said.
Lewis often reviews cover letters and
resumes from students and offers them ad-
vice from the perspective
of a former hiring editor.
Brian Kelley, a jour-
nalism and economics
senior took two of Lewis'
classes and said Lewis
wrote him two letters of
recommendation.
Li He also took a jour-nalism ethics class with
Lewis during a study abroad trip to France
in May 2009.
Kelley said Lewis is probably one of his
favorite teachers.
"He just genuinely cares about the stu-
dents," Kelley said. "He wants them to do
well in life."

Florida's inventors now have the
opportunity to earn a little more cash
to fund their creations.
The Cade Museum Foundation of
Gainesville is sponsoring its first com-
petition to recognize Florida innova-
tors with a cash prize of $50,000 for
the most innovative project.
The deadline for entries is March
31.
The foundation is part of The Cade
Museum for Innovation and Inven-
tion, which is scheduled to open in
2013 in downtown Gainesville. It is
named for Dr. James Robert Cade, the
lead inventor of Gatorade.
"It's a continuation of the legacy of
Cade and fostering the creative spiritin Gainesville," said program director
Monika Oh.
The Cade Prize for Innovation
will also consist of one year of free
office space at the Gainesville Cham-
ber of Commerce and access to the
Gainesville Technology Enterprise
Center.
"We've had a decent number of
submissions, but I expect many to
come in the last 48 hours," Oh said.
The 500-word project summaries
should show the idea is
On innovative, creative, in-Campus terdisciplinary and have
problem-solving charac-
teristics and commercialization po-
tential.
Three finalists will be picked by
May 31 by a local panel of judges, and
the winner will be announced after a
final pitch on June 12 in front of a pan-
el of nationally renowned judges.

Pepsi products shed calories
By ALLYSON FOX
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF's vending machines will still look
the same, but many of the products inside
them might look and taste a little different
when one corporation makes big changes.
PepsiCo Inc., which includes such
product names as Pepsi, Frito-Lay, Gato-
rade and Tropicana, is altering some of its
products to make them healthier, accord-
ing to the company's Web site.
The company plans to reduce saturated
fat, sodium and sugars and add whole
grains, fiber, fruit, vegetables and key vita-
mins and minerals to its products.
Pepsi is also targeting the school system
by eliminating full-calorie beverages and
offering healthier choices, including water,
sports drinks, juices and no- or low-calorie
drinks, according to the Web site.
Robin Zukowski, a personal trainer and
weight loss coach at Gainesville Health
and Fitness Center, believes the changes
made to Pepsi products are the result of
people demanding it.
" think now is one of the first times
there is an awareness about it," Zukowski
said. "As cancer and obesity increase, it isa time everyone is concerned about what
they are eating and feeding their chil-
dren."
Janis Mena, registered dietician at the
Student Health Care Center, said Pepsi's
change could help lead America to solving
its obesity problem.
" It's a step in the right direction," Mena
said.
"As cancer and obesity increase,
it is a time everyone is concerned
about what they are eating and
feeding their children."
Robin Zukowski
personal trainer
About 60 percent of Americans are over-
weight or obese, and in Alachua County,
one in three children are obese, she said.
"Education is important for behavioral
change," Mena added.
It is important to reinforce healthy eat-
ing and to promote education about food
choices, but restricting certain foods won't
solve the problem, she warned.
"People just need to be aware," Mena
said.

So Long, Rush
Web site raises money
to oust Limbaugh
or most liberals, independents and sane conservatives,
Sunday's passage of the health care bill meant one
thing: Rush Limbaugh is leaving the country.
A couple of weeks ago, Limbaugh said if the bill passed
he would move to Costa Rica (apparently he missed the fact
that Costa Rica has universal health care).
Now that the bill has been signed into law, it's hard to
push out of our heads the image of the bald loony, red-faced
and irate, waddling around Costa Rica bitching about how
flawed the country's health care system is and trying to get
his hands on a hamburger.
OK, so we didn't actually expect the Republican Party's
resident nut case to pick up and leave, but we had our hopes,
and we're not the only ones.
Two Brooklyn men created the Web site aticketforrush.
com, which accepts $1 PayPal donations to be put toward the
cost of a one-way ticket to Costa Rica, a moving service for all
his stuff and Spanish lessons to make Limbaugh's transition
as easy as possible.
As of Tuesday night they have raised $1,903.
At the end of April, if Limbaugh goes through with his
original promise, the donations will help him get the hell
out of our country. But if he refuses, the site says, all money
raised will go to the Planned Parenthood Action Center.
This sounds good to us.
Best case, America loses its Supreme King of Douchebag-
gery. Worst case, a deserving organization gets a respectable
donation.
That's what we like to call a win-win.
Tug-o-war
oogle and the Chi-nese government
have been trading
blows the past few days af-
ter Google finally decided to
stop censoring its search en-
gine in mainland China.
Instead, the site Google.
cn began redirecting users
to the Hong Kong server,
which is not censored due
to the "one country, two
systems" concept.
In retaliation, the Chinese
government has disabled
searches that were found
offensive and blocked links
in order to restrict what can
be seen from mainland com-
puters.
Right now, things seem
to be pretty much where
they started unless they're
looked at more deeply.
We are disappointed that
the outcome of this has peo-ple shrugging and saying,
"So what? China's still cen-
sored and censoring. Noth-
ing has changed."
But what must be rec-
ognized is Google's effort.
For months, there has been
speculation on whether they
would leave China after al-
most four years of censor-
ing, and they have managed
to make a decision that is
both strategically and mor-
ally right for them.
Not altogether leaving
China allows them to keep
a "technological toehold,"
and refusing to censor mate-
rial allows them to do what
they feel is right. Censor-
ship still exists, and our fo-
cus is not China's reaction.
Instead, we can see Google
doing making a difficult
choice in an attempt to do
what's right.

So we bring you this professional artist rendering.
Democrats stayed true to convictions
Y es they did.On Sunday, the country found out the Demo-
cratic Party was still alive.
The pundits had left them for dead, Republican Party
leaders had begun trumpeting their chances in this fall's
midterm elections and even some die-hard Democrats
had started cringing every time health care reform was
mentioned.
And lo and behold, on Sunday, Democrats in the
House of Representatives managed to pass the most
transformative piece of legislation to enter the House
chamber since 1965, when Medicare was passed.
Washington broken? Please.
The vote signaled the demise of the GOP's hopes to
recapture a majority in either chamber, and it set the
stage for future campaign rhetoric: "As Democrats, we
said 'yes we can,' and the Republicans responded by
shouting, 'Hell no, we can't!"'
Most importantly, the vote signaled the return of
President Barack Obama.
Many had counted him out for the count, fearing that
those who had warned that he was too young, too inex-
perienced, too green for the job had been right.
How wrong the naysayers were. Obama, ever the
masterful Jedi, managed to inspire the Democratic
House members on Saturday with a stirring speech
evoking President Abraham Lincoln's call that, "I am
not bound to win, but I am bound to be true."
While Democrats both won and remained true to
their convictions, that outcome didn't appear very like-
ly for a long time.
As reform was dragged through the mud by spe-
cial interests, illiterate tea-party "patriots" and media
buffoons like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, Sunday
night's vote seemed like a dream gone wonderfully
right.
But it is a mixed blessing.Despite the bill's bipartisan
attempts -over the past year,
the White House made an un-
precedented effort to reach out
to Republicans, and Republican
amendments were included in the
Matthew Christ House bill -the Republican lead-
letters@alligator org ership only deepened the political
divide in this country by allowing
half-truths and misguided anger
to flourish during this exhaustive national debate on a
gamble of a political strategy aimed at making health
care reform Obama's "Waterloo."
How craven, how unscrupulous, how cheap.
Even as the bill's passage was imminent late Sun-
day night, the vitriol only began to peak. A Republican
representative from Texas, Randy Neugebauer, yelled
"Baby Killer" at pro-life congressman Bart Stupak dur-
ing the House debate Sunday, and minority leader John
Boehner gave such a stirring performance imitating
Jack Nicholson in "A Few Good Men," that he got the
attention of Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel, the brother
of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.
On Monday, efforts to repeal the reform began, and
GOP fundraising drives kicked into overdrive.
All of this was expected. And yet, the Democrats in
both the House and the most important one sitting in
the Oval Office stayed true to their convictions -that a
family shouldn't go bankrupt just because someone had
the bad chance of getting sick, and that politics should
be more than about simply helping yourself, but help-
ing your neighbors too -and passed this historic re-
form bill, with it signaling the return of that little bit
of George W. Bush we've all been missing: certitude in
your convictions.

more. His columns appear every other Wednesday.

Letter to the Editor
Bright Futures changes match purpose
According to the Florida Bright Futures
Scholarship Program's Web site, the scholar-
ship was created in 1997 "to reward students
for their academic achievements during high
school by providing funding to attend post-
secondary education in Florida."
It's been only 13 years since Bright Futures
began funding students' education, and al-
ready the program is running out of funds.
The proposed raising of the standards for the
program are both beneficial and necessary for
the program to continue. The program's origi-
nal purpose was to retain the "bright" -isn't
the state clever? -students within the state,
but now it's being viewed as an umbrella
scholarship for anyone staying in Florida for
higher education.
It was designed to reward high-achieving
students, so why would raising the standards
ever be considered a bad thing?
The problem with a program like this is
that it creates the feeling of entitlement. Withso many students at UF on the program, the
idea is created that Bright Futures is a perma-
nent structure for a state-funded university
education. But a college education is no more
of a right than any material goods are. Merit
as a basis for a scholarship is not just logical,
it's a reflection of every other opportunity in
life that a person receives because they're good
enough, not because the state gets bullied into
spending money. The higher merit standards
will help states and universities get out of their
economic ruts.
When a 970 SAT score, which is average
for the old, 1600 point SAT test, gets about half
of your college education paid for, something
is wrong. Mediocrity shouldn't be rewarded.
Nothing is special about being average. When
we're talking about that state's money, stan-
dards should be raised before we dole it out
to every student who stumbles through high
school.

health care

bill
ourJ response tothehealthcarebillpass-
ing in the House of Representatives
Sunday night, I noticed a friend's
Facebook status that was something
like this: "Here comes the downfall of
America." I expanded the comments to
join in on the sarcastic follow-ups. "The
health care bill is going to kill us all!"
was my best candidate for something
to add. Then I saw that they were all
serious. America really was doomed in
their eyes. Welcome to the end of the
world, I guess.
This kind of hyperbole makes it dif-
ficult for anything to get done. But at
least it admits that the health care bill
could have big consequences on our
society. That's good to realize, because
we can just stop the debate there. Con-
servatives are afraid of social conse-
quences.
It's like talking a little kid out of be-
ing scared of the dark. What do you say
in response to fear? If a kid is afraid, you
reassure him or her with past experi-
ence: "The darkness of your room isn't
actually going to consume you -you
sleep in it every night!" Then you reas-
sure them with promises of the future:
"You'll see tomorrow that the darkness
isn't anything to be afraid of."
But make the same case to conserva-
tives: "This is not the first social change
to come to America, you know. We
make social changes every few years.
Medicare addressed health care for the
elderly. Medicaid helped health care
for the poor. And it's not just health
care that we change.
There's welfare, seat belt safety, gen-
der equality, and so on. We're still here.
European countries have way more
radical health plans and they aren't
totalitarian dictatorships." And they
freak out. John Boehner, House minor-

Will Penman talking about
letters@alligator org the future. "Tax-
es will go up
some for some
people, sure, and we will live in a coun-
try which has a fairer system for getting
medical care." Conservatives are afraid
of this vision.
Keep in mind that fear and distaste
are two different things. I just found out
that New Hampshire doesn't have seat
belt laws for people 18 or older. That's
cool. And if you don't like paying more
so people without the same privileges
can receive medical treatment, that's
cool, too. It's just a difference in taste.
I'm not saying reasonable people can't
disagree on health care.
But being afraid of change just be-
cause it is change, being extremist in
predicting its effects and unwilling to
debate pragmatic issues because of the
idea of America crumbling to a grainy
paste of lost dreams and liberty is crip-
pling means that people have to treat
you like a little kid afraid of the dark.
For a little kid afraid of the dark, talk
and reason is nice, but it eventually
comes down to curling up in Mommy's
bed and waiting for the scariness to go
away. In the morning, you'll forget all
about it.
If that's what it takes, I'm willing
to wait it out. Ever since we stopped
slavery, our country has been doomed.
That was sarcasm. I'll see you in the
morning.

About 30 people attended
By CAROLINE LEWIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
At a public forum Tuesday,
Dan Rua told a group of about 30
people why Google should give a
gig for Gainesville.
Rua, president of Gainesville
Area Innovation Network, a net-
work that encourages technol-
ogy enterprises in Gainesville,
emphasized the need for support
of Gig4GNV, Gainesville's cam-
paign for ultra-high-speed Inter-
net.
Friday is the deadline to
submit community support for
Gainesville's bid.
Rua encouraged members
of the community to nominate
Gainesville then post Facebook
and YouTube videos to support
the campaign.
"I want to see more funny and
passionate videos from the stu-dents," he said.
Google is planning to build
an ultra-high-speed fiber broad-
band connection in a city that
best shows its qualification and
enthusiasm.
Google plans to offer the In-
ternet upgrade at a competi-
tive price to a city ranging from
50,000 to 500,000 people, accord-
ing to Rua.
Around Rua ex-Gainesville plained the
network would
result in a speed about 100 times
faster than what's available in
homes now.
Ted Kellerman, director of
GRU's GRUCom telecommu-
nications services, said Google
would be spending between $200
million and $300 million to con-
struct the network in the city of
Gainesville.
A Santa Fe College studentanswers
raised concerns over privacy is-
sues for potential Google Internet
users.
"What's to stop them from
selling our data to the govern-
ment or businesses?" Garrett
Krinsky asked.
Moselaine Elan, who moved to
Gainesville in early March from
Fort Pierce, said she is hopeful
Gainesville will be chosen.
"I think it offers so many
amazing things for our commu-
nity and education," Elan said.
At the forum, attendees could
record video clips to post to the
Gig4GNV's YouTube channel.
Ian Elsner, who recorded vid-
eos in a separate room during the
forum, said he thinks the city is
very qualified.
"If Gainesville can harness
the wildness and creativity of its
people, then we will have a good
chance to win," Elsner said.

He also said the group demands the investigation be
completed in a more timely manner.
"With the semester coming to a close, the students de-
serve to know what happened," Fernando said.
Jose Soto, a member of the coalition and a member of
Graduate Assistants United, said Telles-Irvin questioned
the amount of student support the group's list of de-
mands has.
As a result, the group will be gathering signatures this
week and holding another rally April 6 at 4 p.m. on Tur-
lington Plaza.
The Group's List of Demands
1. UPD drops all charges against Kofi Adu-Brempong
2. An independent investigation into the shooting
3. Implementation of an independent review board for the review
of UPD's use-of-force policy on campus
4. Indefinite unpaid suspension of the shooter, Officer Keith Smith,
pending the results of an investigation
5. Improvement of mental health and crisis services on campus
6. Elimination of UPD's Critical Incident Response Team (CIRT)

Fontana looks to continue on-base streak against FGCU
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
After smacking 15 homers and
racking up a school-record 85 RBIs
in his freshman year, everybody
expected Preston Tucker to pick up
his fair share of walks this season.
But what people didn't foresee
was that freshman shortstop Nolan
Fontana would be the one to draw
more free passes than any player
on the Gators through the first 19
games.
The 5-foot-11, 190-pound fresh-
man has reached base in every
game except the first one of the
season, and he will look to continue
that 18-game streak tonight as No.
2 Florida (16-3, 3-0 Southeastern
Conference) goes up against Flori-
da Gulf Coast (12-6) at 6:30 in McK-
ethan Stadium.
"He doesn't swing at balls
out of the zone," UF coach Kevin
O'Sullivan said. "I can count on my
hand, how many times I remember
that he's swing at balls out of the
strike zone."
Fontana has started every game
this season, and has only struck out
five times while earning a team-
high 16 walks.
He has drawn three more freepasses than Tucker and has tallied
one less punch out.
"My mindset is to be patient,
but it's also to be aggressive when
the one pitch in the at-bat comes,"
Fontana said. "I try to be patient at
the start of the at-bat to see as many
pitches as I can, but when I see that
one pitch, I try to put a good swing
on it."
"It certainly gives us an-
other element offensively.
He's a really good all-
around baseball player.
He's played outstanding
defense for us, he bunts
well and runs the bases
well. There is really no glar-
ing weakness in his game."
Kevin O'Sullivan
UF baseball coach
Usually, that one pitch is a fast-
ball, Fontana said.
But when the freshman does get
on base, he doesn't stop there. He
has stolen five bases on six attempts
this season, while scoring 15 runs in
19 games.
"It certainly gives us another el-

Cornell poses test for UF
0 FLORIDA WON ITS LAST TWO
GAMES BY A COMBINED 37-6.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
On paper, Florida looks like a lock
to continue its dominant ways tonight
against Cornell, but numbers may be
misleading.
The Gators (5-3, 0-1 American La-
crosse Conference) are on an emotional
high after winning their last two games
by a combined score of 37-6, and they'll
host the Big Red (2-4, 1-1 Ivy League),
losers of two-straight, at 6:30 p.m.
"We're coming off a really great win,
and we just need to keep that momen-
tum going, play hard, and continue do-ing what we did on Saturday," UF coach
Amanda O'Leary said.
But Cornell will give Florida a more
difficult challenge than its last two oppo-
nents, New Hampshire and Marist, so a
blowout may not be in the cards for the
final match of a three-game home stand.
Cornell suffered three
of its four losses by two
points, and two of the
three were against top-Lacrosse 25 teams Rutgers and
Loyola.
And the Gators will be without
sophomore Rachael Zimmerman, who
injured her knee during pregame warm-
ups against New Hampshire.
O'Leary said an MRI revealed that

Rumors swirl around Donovan
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@a lIigator org
Florida coach Billy Donovan has been
surrounded by rumors the last few years,
and this offseason doesn't appear it will be
any different.
Two days after the Gators'season came to
a close with a first-round loss to BYU in the
NCAA Tournament, Donovan's name was
brought into the mix for the vacant coaching
jobs at St. John's and Oregon.
A New York Daily News report Tuesday
said Donovan turned down a $3 million per
year contract to coach the Red Storm in New
York City, but UF spokesman Fred Demar-
est said there was "no truth" to the report.
"Billy was hugely flattered about be-
ing offered a job with such potential," a
source told the Daily News. "But he and his
family have something great going on in
Gainesville."
Demarest said Florida was never con-tacted about the job, and Donovan was not
offered a contract.
The Daily News cited a "confidant of Don-
ovan," who said wealthy St. John's alumnus
Mike Repole offered the Long Island native
the contract on behalf of the school.
The Eugene Register-Guard reported
Tuesday that Oregon will
soon offer Donovan a deal
as well, as sources have
indicated the program's
interest in Donovan.
Donovan's current
contract with UF is worth
about $3.5 million per
Donovan season, a deal he agreed
to after winning back-to-
back national championships and leaving
the Gators for a short stint with the Orlando
Magic before returning to UF.
Last offseason, Donovan was mentioned
as a candidate for the then-vacant Kentucky
job, which was filled by John Calipari.

U New Jersey Nets CEO Brett Yormark reportedly got in an argument with a fan
who had a paper bag over his head. I'm pretty sure he wasn't mad at the specta-
tor; he just wanted to know where he could get one, too. .The NFL made a
slight change to its playoff OT rules to this new concept where both teams have
a chance to score. College football should look into it.

Zimmerman out for season
Matt Tripp/ Alligator Staff
UF attacker Ashley Bruns (left) has notched 12 goals and seven assists in the Gators' last
two games, which they won by a combined score of 37-6.LACROSSE, from page 14
and midfield, tore her left ACL and has
meniscus damage that will cause her to
miss the rest of the season.
"That's a huge loss, on the field, off the
field," O'Leary said. "On the field it's dif-
ficult, because she played a critical role,
coming off the midi-attack sub, so she's a
big loss for us."
Despite missing the last game, Zimmer-
man ranks second on the team in ground
balls and is tied for the lead in turnovers
forced.
To fill thevoid, perpetual scoring threats
like attacker Ashley Bruns and midfielder
Colby Rhea will be expected to continue
leading UF's offense.
The duo has been unstoppable lately.
Bruns leads the team with 12 scores
and seven assists in the last two games.
She has run an efficient offense, and her
play against Marist and New Hampshire
earned her Rookie of the Week by Wom-
ensLax.com.
Rhea, who scored six goals in the last
two games, said she is more of a cutter
than a driver on offense, but that works"I work with Ashley a lot; she's
a good feeder for me. When we
are working well together, that's
when most of my goals are
scored, so it's been good."

"I work with Ashley a lot; she's a good

"When we are working well together,
that's when most of my goals are scored,
so it's been good."
UF coach Amanda O'Leary said she
didn't intentionally string three less com-
petitive home games together, but the stint
has certainly come at a beneficial time,
breaking up a losing streak and putting
the team in a better frame of mind going
forward.
"These couple games are building our
confidence up, so when we play Ohio
State, our next ALC game, we can play
with them and hopefully beat them," Rhea
said.

BASEBALL, from page 14
ement offensively," O'Sullivan said. "He's a really good all-
around baseball player. He's played outstanding defense for
us, he bunts well and runs the bases well. There is really no
glaring weakness in his game."
While Fontana has been one of the most consistent players
for UF, his spot in the batting order has been just as in flux.
He started out the season hitting eighth, but has since
jumped around from the seventh position, to sixth, to sec-ond and then to fifth in the order. Fontana's ability to get on
base makes him a prime candidate for the top of the order.
However, with lefties Matt den Dekker and
Tucker already taking up the first and third
spots, O'Sullivan said he is hesitant to insert
the freshman into the two hole because he isBaseball also a left-handed batter.
Wherever Fontana is put, he will always
keep the same approach because it works for him.
"It's kind of just something (patience) I've been blessedwith," he said. "I feel like throughout the years, the more
pitches I see in a at-bat, the more successful I've been."

Hartung joins Cirque du Soleil
0 THE FORMER GATOR WILL BEGIN
TRAINING FOR THE SHOW IN JULY.
By TOM GREEN

Corey Hartung came to UF not knowing
what she wanted to do after she finished her col-
legiate gymnastics career and got her degree.
She still isn't sure, but she's found something
to hold her over for a few years.
The 10-time All-American, who is serving as
a student coach for the Gators this year, will be
headed to Montreal in July to begin training for
Cirque du Soleil.
"I like being active and doing different cool
and creative things," Hartung said. "I definitely
don't want to sit in an office to do my job. I think
that's why I chose to do Cirque for a while, be-
cause my body is still healthy. A lot of gymnasts,
after four years of college gymnastics, they're
burnt out and their bodies are dead, but mine is
still healthy and going strong."
Hartung described it as an "awesome oppor-
tunity." She said it started about one year ago
when several people suggested it to her.
"At first I was like, 'No, no, no,' but I knew
a few girls who did it, like [former Florida
gymnast Nicola Willis] and I started thinking I
would do it," Hartung said.
Over the next few months, she decided to
pursue the opportunity with the support of UF
coach Rhonda Faehn, who thought Hartung
would be a great fit.
In June, Faehn e-mailed people she knew
who were involved with Cirque du Soleil. Later
on that day, Hartung heard back from the peo-ple in charge of recruiting for the show.
They began sending e-mails back and forth,
and Hartung sent them an audition tape dis-
playing her conditioning, flexibility, bar, tum-
bling and dance skills.
"I told them I Couldn't, that I had
obligations here and that my heart
was with the team. I had to graduate.
I was kind of bummed, because when
you get that offer, you want to pack
your bags and go, but I knew I couldn't
leave yet."

By August, Hartung received a call with an
offer to start training for Viva ELVIS, Cirque du
Soleil's Elvis Presley-themed show.
"I told them I couldn't, that I had obligations
here and that my heart was with the team,"
Hartung said. "I had to graduate. I was kind of
bummed, because when you get that offer, you
want to pack your bags and go, but I knew I
couldn't leave yet."
They understood and told Hartung they
would be glad to have her join once she gradu-
ates in May.
After graduation, she will prepare for Mon-
treal, where she will go through rigorous gener-
al training and conditioning until she is placed
in a show.
"I've never been to Montreal," Hartung said.
"I've been to Canada a couple of times, but I
guess I need to start learning French."Harrison uiamona / Aiigazor biari
