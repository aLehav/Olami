A robber is still on the loose af-
ter he stole prescription medication 
from a 50-year-old man earlier this week.
The man was robbed at a park-
ing garage across from Shands at UF on Monday, according to the University Police Department.
The suspect was described as a 
15- to 20-year-old black man with long, black dreadlocks.
The alleged robbery took place 
around 3:30 p.m. between the first and second levels of Parking Ga-
rage 10 as the victim was leaving Shands, according to UPD. The suspect pushed the victim, who is not 
affiliated with UF, and grabbed a bag containing his medications, said UPD Lt. Robert Wagner.
“I think it was a crime of oppor-
tunity,” Wagner said, adding the victim was not injured, and there was no mention of any weapon.
He said crimes like this can often 
be prevented.
“I would maybe consider, you 
know, walking around with a bag that’s obviously got prescription medication in it as similar to walk-ing around counting cash,” he said.
The suspect is believed to be 
about 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 8 inches and 140 to 155 pounds. He was said to be wearing a “black, flat-billed cap, similar to a fedora, a black shirt and black shorts, accord-ing to a UPD press release.
Wagner asked anyone with in-
formation about the crime to con-tact UPD.

Children ride bicycles on the 
cracked pavement of the parking 
lot at Seminary Lane Apartments, 
and the lawns are hardly more 
than leaf-strewn patches of dirt, but Calvin Bryant said he remem-bers a time when it seemed luxuri-
ous. 
“When I first moved in, I loved 
it,” he said. “I had never lived 
where there were two bathrooms. I had my own grass.”
Bryant, 64, who 
has lived at the sub-sidized housing com-plex for exactly half his 
life, used his grass to plant a tree, which still stands.
But in less than two months, 
the tree, along with the rest of the complex, will be torn down, and 
Bryant worries that he won’t be 
able to find another place he can afford.
“You gotta be dirt low poor to 
live here,” he said. “People are scared. We need a place to stay.”
Karen Godley, vice president 
of the board that oversees more than 50 duplexes at Seminary Lane, 1019 N.W. Fifth Ave., said the apartments have been losing money for five years.
“It’s no longer feasible to con-
tinue to rent them,” she said.
Godley said the residents will 
receive their vouchers in April, 
which will give them about a 
month to find new housing before the May 27 move-out date. Most low-income complexes won’t re-serve an apartment until potential 
tenants present a Section 8 voucher 
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Usually vouchers are distributed only two weeks in advance, she said.

Astronauts successfully install solar wings
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Spacewalking astronauts in-
stalled the last set of solar wings at the international space station 
Thursday, accomplishing the top job of shuttle Discovery’s mission.
Steven Swanson and Richard Arnold II struggled with some cable 
connections, but managed to hook everything up.
“It wasn’t quite as smooth as we had hoped, but those guys did a 
great job,” astronaut Joseph Acaba told Mission Control.
Mission Control radioed its praise: “We’re delighted to accept de-
livery and installation.”
The next milestone will be Friday, when the folded-up solar 
wings are unfurled.

Denouncing a “squandering 
of the people’s money,” lawmak-
ers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on mil-lions of dollars in employee bo-nuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies.
The House vote was 328-
93. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate and President Barack Obama quickly signaled general support for the concept.
“I look forward to receiving 
a final product that will serve as a strong signal to the execu-tives who run these firms that such compensation will not be 
tolerated,” the president said in a 
statement.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told colleagues,

More Gainesville residents are 
giving their green thumb a shot 
these days, in line with a national trend aimed at lowering the grocery bill.  
A survey released by the Nation-
al Gardening Association found that as the economic recession continues to grow, the number of household gardens is spreading, too.The number of Americans culti-
vating home-grown veggies rose by 7 million, up 19 percent from 2008, according to the survey.   
Sydney Park Brown, a UF ex-
tension specialist for the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, said alternative gardening is a good choice for college students who may not have a backyard.  
Hydroponic gardening, which 
does not require soil, is one of those options.  Shannon Ivins, manager of Sim-
ply Hydroponics, said she’s seen a major increase in the number of cus-
tomers in her store since the start of the year.
“People are trying to feed their 
families without spending so much 
at grocery stores,” she said.
Ivins said although hydroponic 
gardens are a bit pricier, they pro-duce higher yields. 
“You can get a good garden go-
ing for about $50,” she said, adding students receive a 10 percent dis-
count. 
She also said nutrients can be 
sold for as low as $7 a pound. When diluted, this makes about 100 gal-lons of plant food.
However, Park Brown said hy-
droponic gardens can be tricky to 
maintain, since the water’s pH levels and nutrient levels must be checked regularly.
“Students shouldn’t only con-
sider hydroponics as the only alter-native gardening solution,” she said. 
“There are several above-ground 
options like growing plants in con-tainers.”

Despite the faltering economy, recent 
Gainesivlle crime statistics paint a surprisng 
picture.The number of homicides, robberies, rapes, 
aggravated assaults, burglaries and auto thefts in Gainesville decreased between 2007 and 2008, with larceny   — theft of personal prop-
erty — being the only crime that increased, ac-
cording to a GPD report. 
Crimes are divided into two types: violent 
crime and property crimes.
Violent crime is down from 1,117 in 2007 to 1,044 in 2008, said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg. 
Fighting violent crime is the 
highest priority, he said, because 
people are being harmed.
“Our ultimate goal is no vio-
lent crimes at all,” Kameg said. 
“But the reality is we live in a city where crime is prevalent. It is how we react to these crimes is what we are focusing on.”
Burglary and auto theft, both property 
crimes, are also down. Kameg attributes the 
drop in crime to new police strategies.
When Police Chief Norman Botsford saw 
the numbers from 2005, he started the Violent Crime Task Force, which assigned more of-ficers to work “the worst hours in the worst 
areas,” Kameg said.AROUND GAINESVILLELocals turn to hydroponics to keep grocery bills low

�NEW ACT SHOULD CREATE 
175,000 NEW SERVICE JOBS.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The federal House of Representa-
tives voted 321-105 to expand fund-
ing for volunteer programs Wednes-
day.
As part of President Obama’s 
goal to alleviate America’s economic crisis through service, the GIVE Act 
should create 175,000 new service jobs, bringing the national number 
of volunteers to 250,000. The act will 
create four new service corps: a Clean 
Energy Corps, an Education Corps, a 
Healthy Futures Corps and a Veter-ans Service Corps.
And there is further good news for 
U.S. college students, who are serving 
in record numbers.
Students who volunteer will be 
eligible for the maximum authorized 
Pell Grants, which should help them 
k e e p  u p  w i t h  r i s i n g  t u i t i o n .                                                                                                                         
Amy Panikowski, campus re-
cruiter for the Peace Corps at UF, said 
she’s seen an “explosion of interest” from students in recent years.
To Panikowski, it seems the “Face-
book generation” is ready to mobilize and bring about positive change at 
home and around the world.“They’re tired of reading about it,” 
she said. “They want to see it.”
Lily Darnell, a junior psychology 
major at UF, said she volunteers at the 
Sidney Lanier Center in Gainesville, helping teach children with learning 
disabilities such as blindness and ce-
rebral palsy.  Darnell said working with those children helps put her life into perspective and makes her feel good.
“If I can provide three hours of my 
time and have any impact on their 
life, it means a lot to me,” she said.
Darnell thinks it’s 
the same for the thou-
sands of other student volunteers.
“I feel like a lot of times, what’s 
placed on us makes us feel helpless,” 
she said. “Any way we can provide 
to another group, if you help a little part, it makes a difference.”                                                 
Tracey Reeves, director of the UF 
Center for Leadership and Service, said legislation like the GIVE Act is more important than ever.                              
The center organizes trips, such 
as Florida Alternative Breaks, which 
allows students to volunteer in other 
states or countries during spring and winter breaks.
“I think with the economy, it’s es-
pecially important for folks to give back and give a helping hand,” she said.Act benefits volunteersBy ALEX CHACHKEVITCH

Skilled immigrants are leaving the U.S. be-
cause of better career opportunities at home, 
according to a survey.
Using LinkedIn, an online network of 
more than 30 million professionals around 
the world, professors from Duke University, 
University of California at Berkeley and Har-
vard University published a survey of 1,203 
Indian and Chinese immigrants who had 
worked or received higher education in the 
U.S. and then returned to their home coun-tries to work.
Vivek Wadhwa, team leader of the re-
search, said the trend is accelerating greatly 
because they are starting to see more job 
openings in their home countries.
After Sept. 11, many changes occurred in 
U.S. immigration policy that made it more 
difficult for foreigners, especially those from 
Middle Eastern and Asian countries, to come to the U.S. for graduate school or work, said Alfonso Flores-Lagunes, assistant professor 
of economics at UF.
There are about 1 million people in line for 
H-1B working visas, the availability of which 
is limited to 120,000 per year, Wadhwa said.
Puneet Dwivedi, a UF Ph.D. candidate in 
forestry policy and economics from India, said it’s not a problem to get a visa if you get a 
job at a university after you graduate because 
there is no limit on visas in that area.
“But getting a visa in a company is a lot-
tery,” Dwivedi said.
The waiting time for the visa is many 
months, and the permanent residence line is 
worse.
As an immigrant from Mexico, Flores-La-
gunes waited 10 years to get his green card. Because of this wait, some chose to go to Eu-rope for higher education rather than to U.S., he said.                                  
 “Down the road, this might result in less 
skilled population, which means less eco-nomic growth,” Flores-Lagunes said.
The recent recession in the U.S. also might 
have been a catalyst. Though crisis is going 
on everywhere around the world, countries 
such as India and China are still in the middle 
of rapid economic growth, Flores-Lagunes 
said.
Wadhwa, also a senior research associate 
at Harvard Law School and a professor at 
Duke’s engineering school, said people start blaming the immigrants for their financial 
problems when economic crisis occurs.
“Americans lose jobs and wonder why 
that foreigner should have a job but not me,” 
he said.
Wadhwa received a backlash of hundreds 
of derogatory e-mails in response to his re-
search paper, attacking him for supporting 
immigrants.
One reader stated “I, for one, am glad that 
these ‘skilled’ workers are returning to their respective homes. Perhaps my husband will once again be able to work.”                                                                            
According to the research, immigrants 
help fuel the U.S. economy, contributing dis-proportionately to the high-tech sector. They 
co-founded firms such as Google, Intel Corp., 
eBay and Yahoo. Between 1990 and 2007, 45 percent of the growth of the work force con-
sisted of immigrants.STUDENT LIFESkilled immigrants leave US

177 TOTAL VOTES68% YES32% NOAmerica must shed two-party politicsAfter struggling to reacclimate ourselves to the oh-so bru-
tal grind of work and school, the Department of Darts & Laurels can’t help but smile now that the weekend is 
finally upon us. 
While your activities this evening may pale in comparison 
to the absurdities of last week, we’ll go out on a limb and safely assume that your body could use a break.
Unless of course, you happen to enjoy that whole lifestyle of 
self-destruction – more power to you.
As we dread tackling the mountain of laundry bearing 
badges of Spring Break honor, we proudly present you this week’s don’t-even-bother-calculating-how-much-dough-you-dropped-in-Mexico edition of...
Darts&Laurels
While bowling barely qualifies as a sport given the fact that 
a player’s performance actually increases after consuming al-cohol (trust us), there is evidently a degree of danger involved. For punching a fellow bowler in the mouth with a 16-pound bowling ball and knocking a tooth out, the Department of Darts 
& Laurels chucks a dude-it’s-just-bowling DART at lane lunatic 
Ryan Scott David. And to think, they were arguing over who 
held the right to bowl first.
Do you remember where you were when you heard Tim 
Tebow echo the words that will now forever live on in Gator history? The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a lot-of-good-has-come-out-of-this LAUREL to UF for commemorating 
Tim Tebow’s “The Promise” speech with a plaque featuring ev-ery word he uttered in the wake of last season’s upset loss to Ole 
Miss. We bet even the biggest Florida State fan won’t be able to 
walk past the Bill Heavener Football Complex without stopping to take notice. 
Science fiction geeks everywhere collectively shuttered upon 
hearing news that major changes are in store at their destination for the latest in space odyssey programming. For rebranding themselves as SyFy to expand their horizons to include more mainstream shows, the Department of Darts & Laurels launch-es a why-mess-with-a-good-thing DART at the artist formerly 
known as the Sci Fi Channel. What’s next, adding syndicated episodes of “Sex and the City” to the lineup?
Somewhere a Trekkie sheds a tear.Channeling his inner Andy Dufresne, one Missouri inmate 
concocted a scheme seemingly worthy of a “Shawshank Re-demption” redux. The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a get-busy-living-or-get-busy-dying LAUREL to David Rock-
lage for escaping from a hospital after tricking officers into tak-ing him to get medical assistance for his persistent chest pain. 
While we certainly don’t condone criminal activity, there is 
something undeniably laudable about a man going to extreme lengths to regain his freedom.
Word out of Rhode Island informs us that 30-year-old 
women are susceptible to behavior that even a diaper-donning preschooler would deem immature. For biting and punching her son’s principal after learning he had been suspended from school, the Department of Darts & Laurels tosses a why-didn’t-you-just-get-a-five-dollar-footlong-if-you-were-that-hungry 
DART at Aleyda Uceta. Maybe it’s just us, but when we think 
of our parents, we tend to think of people who tend to set far 
better examples than ourselves.
So much for the mom having any leverage to ground her 
son.
With the men’s NCAA basketball tournament in full swing, 
office workers no longer have to worry about getting caught watching all of the madness thanks to the friendly folks at CBS Sportsline.com. The Department of Darts and Laurels gracious-
ly extends a thanks-to-you-we-can-safely-watch-the-games-in-
class LAUREL to the “Boss Button,” for allowing a seamless 
escape plan to avoid having to explain why you were watching Maryland crush California when TPS reports were due by 5. With one simple click of the mouse, you can safely change your screen from Dino Gregory dunking on some overmatched Cal player to a nondescript Excel spreadsheet.
Tenuous situation totally avoided!That’s all for this week. Go catch up on some sleep.  I have a strong stomach. Only a handful of things con-
sistently turn my stomach contents into a downtown sidewalk display: catching a ride post- or mid-drinka-
thon, all songs Nickelback and when, like, people, like, say “like” all the time. Other than those three things, I rarely get to taste my stomach acid.
Lately, though, I’ve recognized a trend starting to give 
me the cold sweats that have always foreshadowed the aforementioned unhappy time. Words like “taxes,” “bail-out,” “aid” and “bonuses” have flooded print headlines and TV top stories. These words too frequently lead to ar-
guments about the overall effectiveness — or lack thereof 
—  of President Barack Obama’s policies. At this stage, I’m 
not quite ready to let the chunks fly because honest debate can present previously unconsidered opinions. My beef arises when the argument devolves from honest debate to 
senseless brand loyalty. 
“George W. Bush is to blame for the failing economy,” 
whines the aging, liberal, hippie douche. “He made us 
fight a war that sent us all to the poor house.”
“Nuh uh,” retorts the pissed off, redneck conservative. 
“You damn Democrats just keep spending and spend-ing. Obama’s stupid bailout is only going to make things worse.”
“I’m still not really sure,” mumbles the spineless Inde-
pendent.
From this point on, each combatant returns to the com-
fort of his respective political corner. The argument goes on for a while as each fighter simply parrots the words of those standing behind him.
Solid work, fellas. You’ve talked each other out of 
compromising in any way and effectively killed off any hope for a sensible agreement. At least you can go home and brag to your ladies about how you held your ground against that sissy tree-hugger or the greedy Nazi.
How far we’ve come in the past 
233 years.
Political parties were not the in-
tention of the founding fathers, and the above hypothetical situation shows why. Competing factions help express a few views, but the 
larger they get, the more divisive they become. Never-theless, political parties are necessary evils. They garner 
support for candidates for offices at all levels of govern-
ment, and they help educate otherwise-uninformed vot-
ers. Unfortunately, there’s always an agenda. Nothing is unbiased. Ever.
What we all need to realize is the closer we cling to 
our preferred political party, the farther we get from our-
selves. Rather than compromising with our opposition to 
achieve a reasonable outcome, we slight our personal ide-als by bending to meet the party norm.
Guys like Rush Limbaugh and Jon Stewart contribute 
to the political polarization of society. Limbaugh says the word “liberal” like anyone else would say “pedophile”. These guys peddle exaggeration and entertainment as if it were governmental action, and it works because we’re largely an instant-gratification society that prefers to be told what to do.
We’re privileged enough to be able to support what-
ever whack job we deem the man for the job, and party should not be as important as policy. Both parties are con-niving organizations that can do good or evil, so define yourself as a voter, not as a Republican or Democrat.

I’ll be up-front: I think Charter Amend-
ment 1 is abhorrent, and I hope it’s de-feated. But I don’t think that anybody 
who feels differently is automatically a bigot. 
This issue is one that lends itself to an 
honest, meaningful conversation about dis-crimination and the role of city government, but that’s a conversation Citizens for Good Public Policy, the local group pushing for the amendment’s passage, has made clear it isn’t interested in having.
Take their two TV commercials, avail-
able at youtube.com/humandecencynow.
The first ad shows a small girl — blonde-
haired, cheerful and innocent — walking into a restroom at the playground. The screen goes black and white, then a sketchy-looking, unshaven man walks towards the bathroom, looks around to see if anybody is watching, and follows the girl in. Ominous text appears: “On January 28, 2008, your City Commission made this legal… Is that 
what you want in Gainesville?”
The implication is that the man intends 
to violate the girl; saying that the gender 
identity ordinance “made this legal” — as if a clause that made molestation lawful was written into the ordinance — directly links transgender people with child molesters.
CGPP’s insistence that the ad refers to 
those who would exploit the law, and not transgender people, rings hollow. There’s 
nothing in the ad that suggests that level of 
nuance, and 30-second TV commercials are hardly the medium by which nuanced po-litical messages are communicated.
Rather, political TV spots are used for 
creating quick, visceral reactions and sim-plistic associations, and this one was no exception. Any suggestion by CGPP to the contrary is just posturing and an exercise 
in half-hearted plausible deniability. The 
damage is already done as soon as the as-sociation is formed, and no amount of, “We didn’t mean transgender people, honest!” can reverse that.
The second ad features footage from a 
Gainesville Home Depot security camera on Feb. 18 of a man who entered the wom-en’s bathroom and tried to take cell phone 
pictures of a woman in a stall. A voiceover 
says, “What the city commission told us never would happen just did, right here in Gainesville.”
Except that, once again, it’s a sleight-of-hand trick. There’s no reference to gender identity in the GPD incident report, and the 
suspect didn’t at-
tempt to cite the ordinance in his defense. 
According to a January 2009 Associated Press article, GPD hasn’t reported a single problem in public restrooms resulting from the ordinance.
On its Web site, CGPP lists about a doz-
en incidents from across the country about men acting lewdly or violently after enter-
ing women’s bathrooms as evidence that 
“restroom crimes are common occurrenc-es.” They do mention that none of the inci-dents have anything to do with transgender people. 
But none of them have anything to do 
with transgender protections, either. In fact, the list winds up inadvertently making an argument against CGPP’s position — these 
crimes take place irrespective of whatever 
anti-discrimination laws are or are not on the books.
I know advertising is a dirty business, 
and political advertising doubly so. But there’s something especially repugnant about advertising that exploits people’s fears and magnifies their worries for their children and grandchildren. It foments an atmosphere of paranoia that makes the stig-
matization of minorities a lot easier.
I’m against Charter Amendment 1 be-
cause I believe anti-discrimination protec-
tion for Gainesville’s LGBT community is important, both as a practical matter and as a show of compassion and decency.
The rejection of the amendment will pro-
tect Gainesville’s reputation in the eyes of prospective students, residents and busi-
nesses
After all, it’s one thing simply never to 
have had these protections, but it sends an 
entirely different — and horrible, and inac-curate — message about what kind of city Gainesville is to revoke them after the fact.
But a “no” vote on Charter Amendment 1 
would also be a repudiation of CGPP’s ma-nipulative, fear-mongering campaign and a 
statement that we expect a higher level of 
discourse.
Because we’re better than this. And more 
importantly, Gainesville deserves better.

Although President Barack 
Obama recently lifted restrictions 
that previously denied federal 
funding to medical research insti-tutions studying embryonic stem cells, UF won’t be seeing an im-mediate impact, experts say.    
Dennis Steindler, executive 
director of the university’s McK-night Brain Institute, said adult stem cells, which can come from 
brain, bone marrow and organ tis-
sue, will continue to be the main area of focus for research pur-poses.
This is because most of the 
conditions researchers at the McKnight Brain Institute are try-ing to cure are more prominent in adults, he said.   
“We’re looking for cures for all 
the main diseases and injuries,” he said. “Pretty much everything is on our radar.” 
Steindler also pointed out that 
stem cell research was still an op-tion in the past. 
“The previous executive order 
did not stop stem cell research, it just said embryonic lines start-ing after 2001 must use private funds,” he said.
Even though the McKnight 
Brain Institute will not experience an immediate impact from the lifted ban, it will still see benefits from Obama’s legislation. 
“The president’s stimulus 
package has a variety of stem cell initiatives as well,” he said, add-ing he plans to apply for several types of grants. 
One particular grant Steindler 
said he is interested in will pro-vide funding for research involv-ing induced pluripotent stem 
cells.
“This is an alternative to em-
bryonic stem cells,” Steindler said. 
“We can reprogram adult cells to become embryonic-like.”
He said adult stem cell and 
induced pluripotent stem cell re-search will be the main focuses of the McKnight Brain Institute for 
now, but he said he can not pre-
dict how Obama’s decision will affect UF’s research in years to come.
Whether the McKnight Brain 
Institute chooses to take part in using embryonic stem cells for 
research, Steindler said he thinks 
Obama’s decision will have a pos-itive impact. 
 “It will raise attention and 
hopefully increase funding,” he said. “With President Obama’s 
orders, hopefully all types of stem 
cell research will be supported.”UF RESEARCHStem cell ban reversal may bring research fundingFRIDAY, MARCH 20, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Floridians can now track how the state 
spends their tax dollars on a new Web site.
Gov. Charlie Crist and Chief Financial Of-
ficer Alex Sink announced Tuesday the launch 
of Sunshine Spending, a Web site that allows Floridians to see where the state spends tax dollars.
 “Taxpayers are able to look at the amount 
paid to specific vendors within a particular fis-cal year,” said Debra Evans, a spokeswoman 
for the Florida Department of Financial Ser-
vices’ Bureau of Accounting. “Clicking on the agency provides the individual payments and a contact phone number for additional infor-mation about the payment.” 
The Web site aims to make state spending 
more transparent to taxpayers and make the state more accountable for its spending. Citi-zens can check payments to vendors dating 
back to the 2004-2005 fiscal year, including de-
tailed information about each payment and the agency requesting the information. Sunshine 
Spending was planned six months ago and is updated daily by the Florida Depart-ment of Financial Services. 
The site is maintained at 
no extra cost to the state by using existing resources and 
employees, Evans said.
The Sunshine Spending 
Web site was produced by 
the Department of Financial Services in coop-eration with representatives from the Gover-
nor’s office, Americans for Tax Reform and the 
James Madison Institute.
“The Web site is a positive step, though at 
present it still needs more development to be user friendly,” said David Denslow, a UF pro-fessor and research economist. “It is a positive step partly because voters are more willing to support the services government provides if they are confident waste is under control.”
Floridians can visit the site at www.FLGov.

DALLAS — The Dallas school 
system was rocked by allegations 
Thursday that staff members at 
an inner-city high school made 
students settle their differences by 
fighting bare-knuckle brawls in-side a steel cage.
The principal and other em-
ployees at South Oak Cliff High knew about the cage fights and al-
lowed the practice to continue, ac-
cording to a 2008 report by school system investigators.
“More than anything, I’m in 
shock and disbelief — shocked that this could ever occur and shocked 
that it would be 
condoned by a pro-
fessional adminis-
trator,” said Jerome 
Garza, a member of 
the Dallas school board.
The report, first obtained by 
The Dallas Morning News, de-scribes two instances of fighting in an equipment cage in a boys’ lock-
er room between 2003 and 2005. 
It was not clear from the report 
whether there were other fights.
Superintendent Michael Hino-
josa told the newspaper that there were “some things that happened 
inside of a cage” and called the fights “unacceptable.”
No criminal charges were ever 
filed, and there was no mention in the report of whether anyone 
required medical attention or 
whether any employees were dis-ciplined.
A district spokesman would 
not comment.

Gainesville has been promised about $7.8 million in eco-
nomic stimulus funding, according to Thursday’s city com-
mission agenda.
The announcement comes just over a month after Presi-
dent Barack Obama signed The American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act of 2009 into law. Money was awarded through a population-based formula.    
“The dollars are appreciated, but the vast majority of them 
are capital investment,” said Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, refer-ring to controls set on the funds.
Much of the money can only be spent on buildings and 
items and may not be used to fund programs, said Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa, a city commissioner.
About $3 million will go to buying new buses for the 
Regional Transit System, as awarded through Transit Capi-
tal Assistance, according to a presentation given during the meeting. Additionally, there are 22 state and federal grants 
that Gainesville will compete for.
“I think we’ll be really competitive on these things,” Mas-
trodicasa said.
Commissioners also discussed a possible new ordinance 
that would create stricter safety rules  for bicycle taxis that patrol the streets near campus on game days.
The ordinance, which would regulate carriages pulled by 
bikers or pedestrians, passed first reading unanimously. To 
become law, the ordinance must pass a second reading on April 2. Currently, there are no safety rules governing bike 
taxis in Gainesville, according to a Public Safety Committee 
report.
“They’ve been running around wild for quite a while,” 
Gainesville Police Department Corporal Fernando Zaragoza 
said in an interview.
Under the ordinance, bike taxi providers would be required 
to obtain insurance, permits and limit passenger loads.
In addition, rates must be displayed and bikes have to be 
equipped with a horn, lights and other safety features.
Street restrictions for bike taxis were discussed at length. The streets that will be off-limits to the bike

“We do want them off University Avenue,” Posey said.
The commission moved to have the list of streets discussed 
at a Public Safety Committee meeting before becoming law.
Catherine Ojeda, speaking for Redi Pedi Cab Company, a 
bike taxi service based out of Orlando, expressed concern as to which streets would be blocked from bike taxi use. Ojeda said the taxi service benefits many game goers, es-
pecially those who can’t walk for long.
“Without us, they wouldn’t find a way to the game,” she 
said.
Alex Ramos, president of Gainesville Rickshaws, added 
that bike taxis can be a safe alternative to drunk driving.
“We stop them from getting their cars and taking the risk,” 
he said.GAINESVILLE COMMISSIONCommissioners discuss proposed ordinance, funding10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 2009

Shagari Phipps, 13, a resident of Seminary Lane, holds her new puppy, Angel, 
outside the subsidized housing units on Thursday afternoon.
for the closing, said she hopes to see the cur-
rent tenants return once the property is re-developed, but she can’t guarantee the pos-
sibility.
“If they’d like to come back, we hope they 
qualify. We really do,” she said. “But you 
know what? They’re moving on to better 
housing than what they have now.”
But for Takarra Moore, the transition will 
be no luxury.
Moore, 24, lives with her two sons,  4-year-
old Titus and 1-year-old Philemon, and fears that the cost of moving will be too steep.
“If you get the voucher and you have no 
money, you’re still homeless,” she said. “You 
still need to pay moving expenses, transfer-
ring utilities, security deposits.” 
Moore worries that she won’t even qual-
ify for the voucher because criminal records 
affect eligibility.
According to Section 8 counselor Gyra 
Bossle, vouchers are not given to anyone who has been arrested — even without con-viction — in the past five years.
This may be a problem for Moore, who 
has been arrested, though never charged.
“I got a letter that said ‘congratulations,’” 
she said. “But I don’t think I’m through yet.”
Moore said the arrests also haunt her in 
job applications. She is a certified nursing assistant, but she said her criminal record comes up immediately in most interviews.
“I’m as honest as possible,” she said. “But 
they see the arrest and never look any fur-ther.”
Moore said she took a class through the 
Florida Department of Children and Fami-lies that made her eligible for a $108 month-
ly stipend. But because of her pregnancy, it 
hurt to sit all day, and her car is too old to rely on.
“I know it’s excuses,” she said. “But it was 
just too much for me. That’s life, I guess.”
Moore plans to join the army reserves af-ter she has her third child.
“I need some sort of stability,” she said. “I 
need a way to support my sons.”
Moore, who has lived at Seminary Lane 
for more than a year, said she thinks the clos-
ing of the complex has to do with UF.
“They want to make the area nice for the 
students. We know. We understand,” she 
said. “But don’t sugarcoat it for us. We just want a place to live.”
Moore, who has gone to town meetings to 
plead her case to city officials, said she thinks that if the tenants of Seminary Lane worked 
together, they could influence the city to step 
in and help them.
“If we really grouped up — a force to be 
reckoned with — we could convince them to 
do something. I really believe that,” she said. 
“But if we act like we don’t care, then they don’t care.”
Gainesville City Commissioner Scherwin 
Henry said the commission is looking for a 
way to use city grants to give money to those 
who don’t qualify for the vouchers, though he agrees that the complex needs to be torn down.
“It’s in great disrepair,” he said, and he 
fears it would become a health and safety problem if the apartments were left in place.
“I’d hate to see it get to that point,” he 
said.
Bryant said water leaks through the roofs, 
and the sidewalks are cracked and jagged.
“One day I had my grandbaby in my 
arms, and I tripped and fell,” he said.
But despite the deterioration, Bryant calls 
Seminary Lane home.
“I’ve been around here all my life,” he 
said. “We’ve built a community, and it’s just not right to take it away.”Residents worry about vouchers

� THE WHALE WAS TRAPPED IN FISHING LINE.
Two UF veterinarians took part in a rescue mission on March 6 
in order to free an endangered species of whale from about 1,000 
feet of fishing line. 
Dr. Michael Walsh, an aquatic veterinarian, and Dr. James Bai-
ley, a veterinary anesthesiologist, helped make up the team of ex-
perts whose mission was to free right whale No. EG3311, which 
was first spotted in January.
Walsh said the whale had its left eye and shoulder entangled 
in fishing net as well as its mouth, which prevented it from eat-ing. The assembled team to help free the whale was made up of veterinarians and employees from national agencies.  
“It was a huge team and coordinated a bunch of very capable 
organizations that worked together and came up with a plan,” Bailey said.
Because of the right whales’ evasive nature, Bailey said seda-
tion had to be used to free it from the netting, with caution so as to not drown the whale. 
“We had to create a cocktail to make the whale cooperative but 
still do what a whale needs to do, which is surface and breath,” he said.
The team made many attempts to sedate the whale before a 
strong enough mixture of sedatives was created and executed.
Walsh said trips were made in January and February before 
the final effort on March 6, and said the team was worried time was running out. 
“Everyone knew that (final) trip needed to be successful,” he  
said. “If we weren’t, it wouldn’t have been able to survive much longer.”  
Walsh said the team traveled on four boats to the area where 
the whale was swimming in order to sedate it.  After the dart, about 2 feet long , was fired successfully, the team was able to cut about 400 feet of line off in about 45 minutes.

UF first lady Chris Machen 
is working like a dog to save healthy animals from euthanasia in Gainesville.
Tonight, Machen is hosting an 
event at the President’s Mansion to thank donors who have given $150 or more to No More Homeless Pets, a local organization working to stop euthanization of healthy animals.
Machen became a board member 
of the year-old organization about six months ago.
Machen’s interest in helping 
local animals was put into action about a year and a half ago when she helped to start the St. Francis House Pet Care Clinic, which offers free veterinary care to homeless and low-income people.
The No More Homeless Pets or-
ganization is trying to build a facility that would control the over popula-
tion of dogs and cats by providing a 
high quality, high volume, low cost spay and neuter center for Alachua and surrounding counties. The goal for the facility is to service about 6,000 animals annually. Donations will fund the daily operations.
“The only way to stop it is to 
have less litters. It’s a pretty easy 
concept,” Machen said.
Last year, philanthropist Gladys 
Cofrin gave the group a $250,000 do-
nation, which the Alachua County Commission then matched, Machen said.
With donations from Cofrin and 
the city, the organization has enough money to build the facility but still 
needs more to purchase equipment 
and hire employees, said Julie Levy, organization president and UF Col-lege of Veterinary Medicine profes-sor.
The group will soon operate tem-
porarily out of a donated semi trailer equipped to spay and neuter up to 120 cats and small dogs per day, 
Levy said.
The trailer, called the Big Fix Rig, 
was originally used in New Orleans 
after Hurricane Katrina to help con-
trol the stray ani-mal population. Humane Alliance, a North Carolina spay and neuter 
clinic, donated 
the rig to No 
More Homeless Pets because of the organization’s 
favorable reputation, Levy said.
Some of the money donated by 
those attending tonight’s function will go toward the $12,000 cost to 
bring the rig to Gainesville and ad-
just it to service big dogs as well.
In 2008, of the 7,598 animals 
brought to Alachua County Animal Services, 3,011 were euthanized, said director David Flagler. 
However, compared to other 
counties, Gainesville has a relatively low euthanization rate because of 
the efforts of organizations like No 
More Homeless Pets, Flagler said. 
“I really count myself blessed 
in this community because this is a place that people really do care,” he said. LOCAL

Backed by his passion for Gainesville’s 
community and public safety, Robert 
Krames said he is ready for change.
Krames said he will implement that 
change if elected to the City Commission 
At Large Seat 1 on March 24.
Krames, 26, works in graphics and Web 
site design. He said his background in technology would drive him to increase innovation in the city. 
He said the current city commission is out of touch with what people want and 
need.
Spending more than $1 million on a 
new golf course was unnecessary, Krames 
said.
He said understands the need for  tax 
breaks because of the current economy, but the money should be spent elsewhere, like on public safety.
He said smart spending is especially 
important when the city government is in a $1.2 million budget deficit that is project-ed to increase to $3 million by 2010. 
“The current government focuses on the wrong priorities and has poor spend-
ing habits,” he said.
Krames is in favor of 
the controversial Char-
ter Amendment 1, which 
would remove the city 
ordinance entitled “Dis-crimination,” which pro-tects gay, lesbian, bisexual 
and transgender people 
from discrimination.
If passed, the amend-
ment would also prohibit the local govern-
ment from creating new protected classes, such as veterans.
The law would then revert to the Flori-
da Civil Rights Act. 
A father himself, he said the ordinance 
began with good intentions, but present 
wording leaves women and children vul-
nerable to pedophiles. 
If elected, Krames said he will make de-
cisions after considering all of the parties’ ideas.
“[Gainesville’s] a great place to raise a 
family and live,” he said. “I will fight to keep it that way.”GAINES vIllE ElEctIoNSCandidate promotes city innovation, safety, Chater 1� HE CAMPAIGNS TO PASS

Holding his hands in a pan-
tomime of the scales of justice, 
Richard Selwach weighs the 
rights of a “45-year-old pervert” 
against those of a “10-year-old girl” while standing in his pawn-shop on Thursday.        
“I’m going to side with the 
little girl,” he said of his sup-port for the controversial Charter Amendment 1.
Selwach is one of three chal-
lengers to the At Large Gainesville city commission seat of Jeanna Mastrodicasa. 
He describes himself as a con-
servative libertarian and cam-paigns primarily on the removal of Mastrodicasa from the City Commission and support for Amendment 1.
The amendment would nul-
lify Chapter 8 of 
the Gainesville Code of Ordi-
nances, titled 
“Discrimina -
tion,” remov-ing protections 
for transgender, 
lesbian, gay and 
bisexual people.
Gainesville would then rely 
on the Florida Civil Rights Act to provide anti-discrimination pro-tections at the state level.
Selwach feels that the ordi-
nance currently leaves women and children open to sexual pred-
ators in public bathrooms. He is 
also skeptical of transvestites, he said.
“I don’t want men with breast 
implants and 10-inch dicks using the bathroom next to little girls,” he said, after pointing out his dis-taste for media censorship of his admittedly harsh viewpoints.                        On student issues, Selwach 
opposes recent restrictions placed on bars, which were largely championed by Mastrodicasa.
The ordinance places stricter 
age restrictions on bars which ha-bitually receive underage drink-ing violations.
He feels that the ordinance 
punishes well-behaved students for the mistakes of a few, Selwach said.
“It’s gonna kill downtown,” 
he said.

BURBANK, Calif. — President 
Barack Obama told Jay Leno on 
Thurday that he was stunned 
when he learned of the bonuses 
that bailed-out insurance giant AIG was paying its employees.
Obama told “The Tonight 
Show” host the payments raise moral and ethical problems and vowed again to try to recoup the cash for taxpayers.
“We’re going to do every-
thing we can to get these bonuses back,” he declared.
Leno asked Obama what he 
thought when his staff first ad-
vised him of the payments, many 
made to traders in the very divi-sion that brought American In-ternational Group to ruin.
“’Stunned’ is the word,” 
Obama replied in a taped ap-pearance on “Tonight.” He said he found it hard to fathom how anyone would accept lavish pay-
ments in those circumstances. 
“People just had this sense of entitlement. We must be the best and the brightest.”
But Obama staunchly defend-ed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who’s increasingly 
come under fire for failing to 
block the bonuses.
“I think Geithner is doing an 
outstanding job,” Obama said. 
“He is a smart guy. He is a calm 
and steady guy. I don’t think people fully appreciate the plate that was handed him.”
Obama added 
Geithner’s carry-ing on “with grace and good humor. 
He understand that he’s on the 
hot seat.”
Too many in Washington are 
trying to figure out who to blame 
for things — when they should be focused on fixing them, Obama 
said.
According to NBC, Obama 
was the first sitting president 
ever to appear on “The Tonight 
Show.” He’d already appeared 
twice as a candidate.
Obama spoke with little inter-
ference or challenge from Leno, who clearly was enthused about 
snaring the president as a guest 
and pronounced it “one of the best nights of my life.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 2009

The secret to looking good 
in the clothes you buy might be 
right in front of you.
A recent UF study suggests 
female consumers have a pref-
erence for dressing rooms with frontal lighting — those installed 
along the sides of the mirror — in-
stead of overhead lights mounted on the ceiling.
Anne Baumstarck, a UF inte-
rior design master’s student who conducted the study, said retail-ers often overlook the importance of how dressing rooms are lit.
The lengths apparel stores 
go to lure customers, like deep discounts and colorful interior designs, are likely to fall short if shoppers don’t like how they look 
in the mirror. It’s not all about the 
clothes, she said.“What woman doesn’t go into 
a dressing room and engage in a dialogue with herself about how attractive she is? You don’t want 
to give her any opportunity to 
feel badly about herself,” Baum-starck said.
In the study, 60 female shop-
pers between 18 and 35 years old who tried on clothes in the dressing rooms at the Gainesville clothing boutique Wolfgang, showed a clear preference for 
frontal lights.
Lighting was so important that 
it was mentioned in 51 percent 
of comments by the women in 
the study, she said. Twenty-five 
of the 36 comments made about overhead lights were negative, while only 14 of the 34 comments about frontal lighting were nega-
tive.
Women complained that over-
head lighting created shadows on their faces, which made them 
look unattractive.
The frontal lighting was de-
scribed as soft and flattering, 
giving their skin a healthy glow 
and making cellulite less visible, Baumstarck said. 
Whitney Ja-
cob, 19, said she is much less likely to buy items in a store if the dressing 
room lighting is 
lousy.
Despite being 
more expensive, she said she pre-
fers to buy clothes from small, in-
timate boutiques because of their atmosphere.   
“Big department stores freak 
me out with overhead lighting,” 
said Jacob, a nutrition science 
major at Auburn University. “Sometimes it’s worth it to buy from a boutique.”
Matthew Turner, owner of 
Wolfgang, said he agreed that frontal lighting made fewer shad-
ows on customers, but that typi-
cally there’s overhead lighting in store fitting rooms.
Turner said he has both types 
of lighting in Wolfgang’s dressing rooms, and that he often switches between the two. He said not all customers prefer frontal lighting, as some customers have com-
mented that the frontal lighting 
is too intense and distracted from the clothes.  
“The goal is to reduce the light 
intensity because it can be over-whelming,” Turner said.
Christy Morgan, owner of 
Dahlia, another Gainesville clothing boutique, said warm, 
soft light makes dressing rooms 
more pleasant. The store has small chandeliers hanging low in front of its dressing room mir-rors, which Morgan said she likes because they give a soft, romantic feel. 
Because customers often spend 
a lot of time trying on clothes, it’s important each room is cozy and inviting so customers don’t mind 
spending time in them, she said.
“You want to feel comfortable 
and not threatened when trying 
to find something flattering,” Morgan said.
Baumstarck said overhead 
lighting makes rooms seem smaller — even cramped — creat-ing a need to escape. With frontal 
lighting, dressing rooms appear 
roomier, and shoppers said they were willing to stay longer and try on more clothes, she said.
“You never want a consumer 
to be thinking ‘I hate this light-ing’ instead of ‘I like this dress,’” Baumstarck said.
Study: Dressing room lighting matters to shoppers
� THEATRE STRIKE FORCE RAISED 
$3K FOR RELAY FOR LIFE THIS YEAR.
By ALEIGHA BROWN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When couches appeared on the North 
Lawn of the UF’s campus, people stopped 
and looked.
On Thursday, Theatre Strike Force, a 
student improvisation troupe, camped out 
for 12 hours by the Reitz Union Colon-nade, complete with two couches, a book-shelf and blankets, to promote its 12 hours of improv event today.
TSF is hosting the comedy event, which 
started in 2005, from noon until midnight to raise money for Relay for Life.
It will take place at the Orange & Brew 
and in Reitz Union room 282.
TSF members asked anyone making the 
trek between Weimer Hall and the Reitz Union to write 12 on a white board on dis-play.
Gus Laguna, a UF economics junior, 
said  the five seconds it takes someone to write on the board gives him just enough time to make his pitch.
TSF member Jessie Ervolino, a UF 
sophomore, said the group has been doing things with the 12 theme to promote to-
day’s event all week, includ-ing a 12-minute make-out ses-
sion and eating an entire pie 
in 12 minutes. 
Laguna said the group improvs for fun, 
but behind the jokes and games, it is all for a good cause.
The event starts at the Orange & Brew 
with open improv from all members of TSF. When TSF moves to room 282, there 
will be scheduled troupe performances 
of both short and long form improv. The 
finale will be held back at the Orange & Brew.
Katie LeBlanc, a UF sophomore and 
TSF member, said it is a free event, but there will be jars for attendees to donate money.
Last year, TSF raised nearly $5,000 for 
Relay for Life and placed third in overall 
fundraising.
So far, it has raised about $3,000 this 
year, according to Ervolino.ON CAMPUS

FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 21
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
Amanda Butler says she bleeds 
orange and blue, and it’s hard not 
to believe her.
There’s no place she’d rather be 
than UF.
If being a Gator means being the 
best, as the UF women’s basketball coach believes it does, why would 
she want to go anywhere else?
For a coach who inherited a 
team on the brink of disaster, But-
ler has turned her dream job into 
an unforeseen reality.
She has made her mark on the 
women’s basketball program inex-plicably fast.
When Butler stepped to the 
podium after being named the Gators’ new leader on April 13, 2007, the questions came.
How long? How long will it 
take to turn this team around?
Nearly two years later, the an-
swer has arrived, as Butler has held true to the team’s motto — “Bigger and Better” — and led the team to 
the NCAA Tournament.
“This is my expectation: I think 
this is the best university in the best 
conference in the country,” Butler said. “To be able to call yourself a Gator, it means that you have 
championship expectations. That’s 
how we’re going to live. That’s 
how we’re going to work. That’s 
how we’re going to play.
“As far as we’ve come, I think 
we’ve seen that. But I also think 
we’ve just scratched the surface.”
The rest of the teams in the 
Southeastern Conference will not like that idea.
In Butler’s eyes, the well of po-
tential at UF is endless.
Toughness
Butler played for UF from 1990-
94 as the Gators’ point guard, help-ing lead the team in her senior year 
to the best record in school history at the time while also compiling an 
undefeated record at home.
Anyone who saw her play knew 
she was tough as nails.
Legend has it that one time she 
popped her shoulder back into 
place by banging it up against a 
wall.
Talk about toughness.
It’s the one thing seniors Sha 
Brooks and Marshae Dotson could think of when asked what quality their coach has instilled in them.
“Toughness,” Brooks said. 
“She preaches about toughness all the time. She says you have to 
be tough. I believe that if you’re 
tough, you can do anything.”
“Just be tough,” Dotson added. 
“Don’t take no crap from anyone. 
That’s just her mindset. She’s very 
aggressive and very straightfor-
ward.”
When Dotson broke her nose in 
the season opener against Xavier last year and chipped her tooth a 
couple weeks later — she needed a root canal and a crown — Dotson said Butler was on her case about missing time in practice.
Dotson not only played in each 
game after her injuries, but she led the team in scoring with 25 and 18 points in those two games.
Freshman center Azania Stew-
art, who was experiencing kidney 
pains in September, said Butler  
— uncertain of Stewart’s illness — 
tried to console Stewart by telling 
her she’d be fine.
Stewart later had to have her 
kidney removed a month before 
the season began.
It’s safe to say there are no ex-
cuses with Butler.
She never made excuses as a 
player, and she has carried that 
same attitude into coaching. It seems to have worked so far.
Gator First, Coach Second
Butler, Dotson and Brooks can 
all remember the first time Butler addressed the team after being in-
troduced as the Gators’ new head 
coach.
“One of the first things I told 
them was that I was not address-ing them as their new head coach, 
that I was addressing them as a 
Gator,” Butler said. “I was ad-dressing them as someone who 
had worn the uniform, and them 
understanding the opportunity for me to be here is maybe even more 
personal than professional.”
Butler had to sell herself to a 
room full of players she hadn’t re-cruited, players who hadn’t chosen 
her to be their coach.
“I wanted to know two things 
from them, and I wanted them to see two things from me and from my staff,” Butler said. 
“I wanted to know how hard 
they were going to work and that I could trust them, and I was going to do my darndest to show them 
how hard I would work and that 
they could trust me. And that if 
we could prove those two things 
to each other every day, then we had a chance to make something special happen.”
It didn’t take long for the play-
ers to buy in to her message.
“This lady is all about busi-
ness,” Dotson said of her first im-pression of Butler. “She’s a very direct person, and you’ve just kind 
of got to respect that.”
The Eyebrow
But even in Butler’s most seri-
ous and intense moments, there’s humor.
Picture this: A screaming coach 
calls a timeout because her team 
just made a terrible mistake in a game. Butler glares into the faces 
of players scared to look her way as 
they make their way to the bench, 
and then Fred comes out.
Yes, Fred — the name players 
gave Butler’s hunched over, raised 
eyebrow that strikes fear in their 
hearts.
“Fred comes out sometimes,” 
Dotson said. “(Butler) came to 
practice sometime last week with 
a hat on and we we’re like, ‘Yeah, we like that. We can’t see Fred.’”
Brooks said her coach has a 
commanding presence when she 
enters a room.
“I tell her all the time she scares 
me because when you walk in the 
room, it’s like the President has 
just walked in,” Brooks said. “It’s 
like you know you better step it 
up, or either you’re going to be in 
the locker room crying or you’re 
going to be on the bench.”
Butler has a slightly different 
take on Fred.
“I don’t know really the look,” 
she said while laughing. “I don’t even know how to do it. It’s clearly an expression that just happens, 
probably in the more intense mo-
ments. But it has become a char-
acteristic that gets their attention, 
and I think that’s probably a good 
thing.”
As high as Fred might be raised 
sometimes, that height doesn’t come anywhere near the level of 
Butler’s expectations for her team.
Butler said if anything about 
her has changed since she took the job, it’s only that her expectations 
have risen.Quick Turnaround
Assistant coach Susie Gardner 
has a theory on why Butler has 
been so successful at UF so quick-
ly.
There were already some play-
ers in place, Gardner says, although she’s quick to point out they were 
the same players who had won just 
nine games the year before Butler’s 
arrival.
Combine the talent with change, 
a chance to spark a new fire and — 
most importantly — adding Butler 
to the equation.
“She made them from Day 1 be-
lieve that they were a special team, 
that they were special players,” 
Gardner said. “We can talk about 
X’s and O’s, but the main part of 
coaching is to make your players believe, and she did that in a very positive manner.”
Butler was hesitant to believe 
she could take this team to the NCAA Tournament early in her 
time at UF. She was more con-
cerned with working hard every 
day and setting a high standard for 
her players.
“What we’ve seen, the progress 
we’ve seen and how quickly it’s 
been made is a demonstration of 
the work ethic of the young ladies 
who’ve committed to an idea of 
trying to be the best,” Butler said.
It’s almost certain they have 
modeled their own work ethic af-
ter that of their head coach.
It’s the mentality that enables 
Butler to fly in from a recruiting 
trip, head to a morning press con-ference and be in the practice gym in time to scout UF’s next oppo-
nent on film while riding an exer-
cise bike and answering reporters’ questions — all at the same time.
The players see that effort from 
their coach and want to replicate it.
The result: a top-25 ranking 
this season and a ticket to the Big 
Dance.
“Has it happened quicker than 
I thought it would? I don’t feel like 
we’re where we want to go yet,” Butler said. “Have we made tre-
mendous strides? Absolutely. But 
we’re not at the top of the moun-tain, and that will be probably the 
greatest measure of how quickly 
things happen.”
For someone who wears her 
passion for this program on her sleeve — and under her skin — the 
question may now become how 
long it will take UF to win a na-
tional title.
“It has everything to do with a 
mindset,” Butler said. 
“It has everything to do with 
having championship expecta-tions, because to me that’s what 
being a Gator is about. You want to be the best. You don’t want to 
finish in the top half of the con-
ference. You’re not trying to be a 
top-four seed. You want to be No. 
1. Clearly we’re not quite there yet, but hopefully taking steps in the right direction.”
With Butler at the helm, UF 
might reach that pinnacle sooner than anyone could have imagined.BIGGER AND BUTLER

Only three of them know the feeling.
When No. 8-seed UF (23-7, 9-5 Southeastern 
Conference) steps on the court Sunday at 2:30 
p.m. in Storrs, Conn., for the first round of the 
NCAA Tournament against No. 9-seed Temple 
(21-9, 11-3 Atlantic 10), postseason experience 
will not be on the Gators’ side.
Of the 15 names on UF’s current roster, se-
niors Sha Brooks, Marshae Dotson and Kim 
Critton are the only players who have ever tasted an NCAA Tournament game, and even 
their experience was brief.
The lone matchup they took part in — a for-
gettable 83-59 loss to New Mexico in 2006 — seems so distant now.
“It’s still kind of new to me,” Brooks said. 
“We made the tournament my freshman year. That was so long ago. I’m pretty sure I’m going 
to be nervous the first game.”
It’s clear UF will not be relying on its post-
season experience if it wants to generate a deep run in the tournament.
The Gators will focus on what got them to 
this point and how they can take advantage of the opportunity.
“Experience does factor in some, but I think 
what factors in a whole lot more to that is readi-
ness, excitement and what your expectations 
are,” UF coach Amanda Butler said.
UF doesn’t want to settle for simply making 
it to the Big Dance.
In fact, the Gators feel like they have some-
thing to prove after not getting the higher seed 
they thought they deserved.“We have a chip on our shoulder right now,” 
Brooks said. “We’re ready to go out there and play.”
The team they’ll face has two common op-
ponents with the Gators. The Owls fell to Au-burn and FSU early in the season by double-
digit margins.
UF went 1-1 against those two teams on the 
road, knocking off the Seminoles in Novem-ber by 15 points but losing to Auburn by 16 in January.
“One of the things that’s been special about 
this team all year long is no matter who we 
were playing or where we 
were playing them, we’ve 
expected to win,” Butler said. “And I don’t think that will 
change in postseason.”
The Gators will be play-
ing on No. 1-seed Connecti-
cut’s home floor, and Brooks 
expects the home crowd to be pulling for the underdog 
Owls to knock off the Gators, something she hopes her team will use to its advantage.
“I think our team will feed off of that,” 
Brooks said.
All Butler is concerned about at this point is 
beating Temple, no matter how little familiarity 
the Gators have with the tournament.
“We have a few players that have some 
postseason experience, some NCAA experi-
ence. Most of our team does not,” Butler said. “But I think when you’re doing something for 
the first time, it’s really exciting when you com-
bine a little bit of experience with a whole lot of excitement. 
“I’ll take that result.”

You may have heard, but in case 
you haven’t: The UF gymnastics team 
is hurting. Bad.
More than a third of the team is 
injured, with Alicia Goodwin and 
Amanda Castillo the latest to fall. 
Goodwin sprained her left knee dur-ing practice Wednesday and is out for the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionships while Castillo partially tore her left Achilles tendon and is out for the season. 
Already on the physically-unable-
to-perform list: Nicole Ellis, Kailey 
Tissue and Rebekah Zaiser.
UF (6-4, 3-3 SEC) is fully aware and 
has no choice but to take the injuries in 
stride as it preps for the SEC Champi-onships starting Saturday.“We could sit here and say, ‘Oh my 
goodness, woe is me, this just awful. I can’t believe we’ve sustained injuries to half our team,’” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “It’s not going to get you anywhere.”
In light of the team’s injuries, UF 
has retooled its lineup for the league championships while trying to keep the other two-thirds of the team as 
healthy as possible.
Faehn said she was looking for the 
team to perform like it did at the be-
ginning of the season.
“We’re trying to look at it positive-
ly in the sense that absolutely we still have potential,” Faehn said. “We have Melanie (Sinclair) 100 percent and Ma-randa (Smith) 100 percent, and we’re 
striving toward having Corey (Har-
tung) 100 percent for regionals. That’s UF GYMNASTICSGators limp to SEC meet

UF coach Billy Donovan shook up the start-
ing lineup in the Gators’ opening game of the National Invitation Tournament, giving fresh-man Erving Walker the nod over Chandler Parsons.
Both players scored in double figures, and 
Parsons registered just his second double-dou-ble of the season.
“Coming out of the SEC tournament, it was 
pretty obvious that Chandler could be playing a lot, and I was trying to help him a little bit,” UF coach Billy Donovan said.
Parsons went for 17 points and a career-
high 14 rebounds against Jacksonville.
“Maybe being in a lot less pressure-, stress-related role is something he is a lot more com-fortable with,” Donovan said. “He did play well yesterday.”
Parsons is averaging 9.4 points and 5.7 re-
bounds per game this season and is shooting 
just 30 percent from 3-point 
range.
“I haven’t been playing 
as well as I should be this 
year,” he said.
Donovan said Walker 
will start again tonight at 7 when UF (24-10) takes on 
Miami in the second round of the NIT.
The Hurricanes (19-12) are led by senior 
guard Jack McClinton, who is averaging 19.5 points per game this year and scored 25 against Donovan shakes up lineupUF back in NCAA Tournament after 2-year layoff

Who’s on first, What’s on sec-
ond, I Don’t Know’s on third.
Lately, predicting who will start 
in the Gators’ infield has been as 
confusing as Abbott and Costello’s 
famous sketch.
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan has 
put out seven different lineups in 
the infield in the last eight games with mostly the same faces, just in different spots.
When UF (11-7, 0-3 Southeast-
ern Conference) opens its three-game series against Tennessee 
(9-9, 1-2 SEC) at 6:30 tonight in Gainesville, the infield could have 
a new look again.
“Good infielders can usually 
play anywhere you ask them to play as long as they have practiced there,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s not like we’re asking a guy to play sec-ond who hasn’t taken ground balls 
there.”
The infielders — Josh Adams, 
Jerico Weitzel, Mike Mooney, 
Clayton Pisani, Brandon McArthur and Preston Tucker — have been inconsistent. They have commit-ted an error in 11 of the 18 games and have had some of their worst games lately.
On Sunday at Arkansas, the 
infielders made four errors, and they booted another three balls Wednesday night against Central Florida.
With only two practice days a week, they often have to cor-rect their problems in games, but the best remedy is usually a short memory.
“Baseball is a sport where you 
just got to forget about stuff,” Weitzel said. “You have to learn 
from your mis-
takes, but you got to let them go and move on to the next day and the next ground ball.”
They are 
making the most of the extra time 
they have to improve, though, tak-ing over 200 ground balls at prac-tices and getting to the field early on game days to get in as many grounders as they can.
To help solve some of the prob-lems in the infield, O’Sullivan has replaced Mooney at shortstop, moving Adams to take over as the leader of the infield.
Adams describes his style of 
leadership as lead-by-example, but the sophomore is now being asked to be a vocal leader as well, 
something he is still learning how 
to do.
As the shortstop and one-half 
of the double-play duo, it is crucial for Adams to communicate with whoever is playing second base that game.
“We’re leaning on Josh to direct 
traffic at shortstop,” O’Sullivan 
said. “It’s the same old baseball 
philosophy that you have to be strong up the middle to be a good team, and that’s why we moved Josh there.”
While Adams is finding a home at short, O’Sullivan plans on tak-ing advantage of the versatility of his other players to find a lineup that consistently works.
He has used Mooney at short 
and third, Pisani at second and third and McArthur at first and third. 
Mooney and Pisani, along with 
Adams and Weitzel, have all seen time in practice at second, short and third to keep as many options open as possible.
And the Gators’ skipper isn’t 
planning to stop mixing up his in-field anytime soon.
“It’s your responsibility as 
a coach to keep trying differ-ent things to see what works,” O’Sullivan said.
“It would be silly to run out the 
same lineup every game if things aren’t clicking.”FRIDAY, MARCH 20, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 23
Providence on Wednesday.
“McClinton is a lot like (Kentucky guard) Jodie Meeks,” 
Donovan said. “He’s a great shooter. He can go for 30 or 40 on 
any given night.”
The Hurricanes missed out on the NCAA Tournament de-
spite wins against No. 16 FSU, No. 12 Wake Forest and Mary-land.
“We’re playing a team that was preseason in the top 10, top 
15, that’s in the (Atlantic Coast Conference) and has one of the best players in the country,” Donovan said. “I think our guys will understand that.”Donovan said his decision to put Walker in the starting line-
up had as much to do with what the point guard brings to the team off the court as on it.
“There’s just a natural competitiveness and toughness that I 
see inside of him,” Donovan said. “We need more of that.”
Donovan said he hopes Walker can develop into the kind of leader his team has been missing.
“It’s a little tougher as a freshman,” Walker said. “You don’t 
want to step on anyone’s toes. It’s a work in progress.”
Walker has tried to ease into the new role by taking charge 
of the freshman class.
“There’s a trust and a bond we can create,” he said. “I feel 
like we can talk to each other about anything.”
PARSONS PULLING FOR OKLAHOMA:  While Parsons said he is 
going to have a hard time watching this year’s NCAA Tour-nament, the sophomore will be cheering for Oklahoma.
“Blake Griffin’s my boy. I talk to him almost every day,” 
Parsons said. “He had a senior trip to Orlando (in high school), 
and he stayed at my house for like a week.”
three heavy hitters.” 
She also mentioned big contributions from 
all-arounders Elizabeth Mahlich and Court-ney Gladys.
The Gators welcome back Hartung, who 
has been sidelined the last two meets with a third-degree strain of the soleus muscle in her left calf, to the competitive lineup. 
She will be performing on uneven bars 
and balance beam, and Faehn said Hartung would probably be in the vault lineup as well.
She still won’t compete on floor exercise 
in an effort to get her fully healthy for the NCAA Regional competition on April 4.
Courtney Gladys, 
who has competed in the all-around in the last two meets, will make it three straight in the SEC Championships.
“I enjoy doing all-
around, to be able to step in for a teammate. I was more than happy to do it,” Gladys said.
Given the injuries, Faehn said the team is re-evaluating how it heads into the meet. The 
main focus is to have every gymnast hit every 
routine possible. 
Winning isn’t out of the question, but the 
Gators will need some help from other SEC foes, including Georgia, which beat UF 198.2 to 196.65 earlier this season. 
The No. 1 Bulldogs’ score is the nation’s 
highest this season.
For a team running on fumes, UF is also 
running on team unity — something not to be 
overrated on the competition floor.
“Almost every other week there was an-
other person going down,” Gladys said. “Our team has come together closer this year because of it. Staying strong and staying as 
one unit is going to help us get through the year.”
With such a close-knit group, it hasn’t 
been easy for the healthy ones to see their teammates’ seasons cut short.
“It’s definitely taking a toll on us,” said 
Ashley Kerr, who unexpectedly filled in for Amanda Castillo on beam during the Utah meet on March 13. 
“It’s really cool that I can be out there, but 
I hate the reasoning. I love that I’m able to step up, but at what cost?”Walker tries to take charge of freshman class, become team leader

The UF softball team is ready for a little 
March Madness of its own.
The No. 1 Gators (29-2, 8-0 Southeastern 
Conference) are entering one of the tough-
est stretches of the season with back-to-back 
series against two highly ranked conference 
rivals ahead. 
With No. 2 Alabama coming to town next 
weekend, UF will face No. 6 Tennessee (24-3, 2-0 SEC) in a three-game home stand at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium this weekend, start-ing with a doubleheader Saturday at 1 p.m.
“We’re in the toughest part of our season,” 
UF coach Tim Walton said. “This is probably 
where the SEC will be won and lost — in the 
next two weeks.”
UF only dropped one conference matchup 
last season — a 1-0 loss at Alabama — and although the team knows the next few weeks will be the biggest test so far this season, Wal-ton wants his players to take a more emotional outlook on the two SEC showdowns.
“The winning ways are almost becoming 
expectations and becoming part of a busi-nesslike mentality,” he said. “The majority of players on this team are 99-7 over a two-year period, and you can’t argue with the success that they’ve had. I just want them to play with a little more enthusiasm and play with a little more excitement.”
UF might also want to 
play with more aggressive-ness at the plate after their slow start against Florida International on Wednes-day. The Gators were outhit 7-4 by the Golden Panthers 
in their first game.
“If we’re going to be suc-
cessful against Tennessee, 
we’re going to have to do a much better job swinging the bat and swinging at good pitches and putting a team away really, really early,” Walton said after Wednesday’s games.
Sophomore pitcher Stephanie Brombacher 
(14-0, 0.72 ERA) said she expects her team-mates to return to their early season form at the plate in the upcoming conference series, but the team’s performance out in the field will be most critical to its success.
“It’s going to be a fight to the end. Every 
game’s going to be close, and we need to play defense like we did (against FIU),” Brom-bacher said. “We need to hit the ball a little bit better, but I think our hitters are ready, and I 
know our team’s ready for Tennessee.”
MEN’S GOLF TRAVELS TO GEORGIA FOR E-Z-GO INVITATIONAL: While students are looking for-ward to the relaxation that comes with the end of the semester, the No. 5 UF men’s golfers are looking forward to the end of school for a dif-ferent reason.
To them, late April means one thing: the 
postseason. With only two events remaining 
in the regular season, the Gators want to make 
the most of their last two tournaments.
The team travels to Statesboro, Ga., to play 
in the Chris Schenkel E-Z-Go Invitational to-day, the first of those final two regular-season events.
“The challenge for us is to keep improving and play well,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “We have to try to focus on the little things, on where we might improve, rather than just go-ing up there with the sole goal of winning the golf tournament,” he said.
Creativity and decision-making on the 
course are two of the key areas Alexander said his team must improve before season’s end.
UF’s previous two tournaments featured 
some of the top competition in the country. In  this tournament, however, UF will be the top-ranked team participating.
“I think our kids are going up there with the 
idea that we have a pretty legitimate chance to win the golf tournament,” Alexander said.
Senior Billy Horschel added to his coach’s 
statement, saying that his team does not want to settle with a top-five national ranking.
“People can say we are playing well, but 
what we want to do here in Florida is win tournaments,” Horschel said.
The five golfers who will play for UF this 
weekend are Horschel, Tim McKenney, Will Strickler, Tyson Alexander and Mu Hu.
