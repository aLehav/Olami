The 32nd annual Downtown 
Festival and Art Show will morph 
downtown Gainesville into a melt-ing pot of art, entertainment music and food Saturday and Sunday. Ranking among the top festivals 
in the nation, the downtown art show allows visitors to meet exhib-iting artists, enjoy live music and sample international cuisine, ac-cording to a news release. 
The City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs de-partment presents the festival that draws about 100,000 people every year and includes about 250 artists, according to a news release.
Nasthia Villavicencio, a 19-year-
old UF economics junior, said when she attended the festival in the past, it was crowded but worth the trip 
because there were interesting ex-
hibits. 
“One that I really liked was a guy 
that used metals to make a 3D ﬁ  g-ure,” she said. “It was fun — you see families and people walking their dogs and enjoying the art.”
Adam Goldstein, a 22-year-old 
UF business administration senior, said the most interesting part is that artists come from across the nation.
“It’s people from all over the U.S., 
not just Florida or close by,” he said. “It’s also really cool that everyone comes to little old Gainesville just for that.”

Victims of sexual assault have another avenue to notify au-
thorities: a website launched Thursday by local agencies.
The website — ReportRapeGainesville.org — was developed 
by Gainesville Police and the Alachua County Victim Services 
and Rape Crisis Center. It features various buttons users can click 
on to report an incident anonymously or to get information about 
victim resources.
The goal is to give victims an additional outlet to report their 
story — one that may be more comfortable than speaking directly to authorities, said Laura Kalt, a victim advocate counselor.
Kalt was inspired to make the website after noticing Minne-
sota law enforcement agencies used a similar model. She ran the idea by GPD Captain Lynne Benck, commander of the criminal investigations bureau. Together, they wrote the website’s content 
while the IT department developed the website.
“We don’t know what the results will be,” Kalt said, “but at 
the very least, it will link people to the right services that will at 
least be available to support them.”
The website presents 12 options for users to click on, including 
“Make an anonymous report” and “Where can I go for help?” The report section prompts questions about the incident, such as where it happened or who the suspect was.Website for reporting

The wait for #UFRising is over — kind of.
The mysterious hashtag has piqued the 
interest of the followers of UF social media accounts since it appeared in posts beginning Tuesday.
Ambiguous posts on Instagram and Twit-
ter, using the handle @uﬂ  orida for both accounts, left followers’ comments and questions unanswered, instead replying to commenters by hinting at a reveal to be an-nounced today.
But UF spokesman Chris Moran said no 
big announcement was planned for today, just the launch of a social media campaign to spark conversation about UF’s future plans to become a top 10 public research univer-sity.
“We recognize that the plan needs to start 
with support on campus,” he said, “a cam-pus culture that strives for improvements and excellence. We want to hear from people on how to get there.”
However, UF’s pre-
eminence plan hinges on the Board of Governors’ approval to be decided at 
a meeting in Miami next week.
The UF Rising Path to 
Preeminence website, urel.uﬂ  .edu/ufrising, was spotty throughout Thursday. When available, a posted description of a plan to raise UF’s status included details of a billion-
dollar campaign and a hiring spree of ac-
claimed scholars and researchers.
After Wade Ingram saw an Instagram 
post, he Googled for answers.
“To me, I had the image of a phoenix ris-
ing,” the 20-year-old UF materials engineer-ing sophomore said. “It’s a little dramatic, but that was my immediate reaction.”

Raela Villanueva wiped the tears from her 
face and grabbed the microphone in front of 
her.
She began singing a song she wrote for her 
brother, Junior, a UF student who committed 
suicide about 16 years ago.
On Thursday, about 50 attendees watched 
as the Survivors of Suicide Memory Garden 
was dedicated to family members and friends whose loved ones killed themselves.
Now, those affected by suicide in Alachua 
County have a place to find peace and reflect on the memories of loved ones they’ve lost in the Cofrin Nature Park, located at 4810 NW 
Eighth Ave. 
Commissioner Randy Wells spoke at the 
dedication. He said the garden represents love 
and can help survivors understand the doubt and confusion surrounding a suicide.
“Someone affected by suicide knows it is 
not an end … but a beginning of lifelong ques-tions,” he said. “I hope and believe something special will come from this space. It represents 
empowerment over futility.” 
John Adams, one of the landscape archi-
tects for the project, said when he and his team 
were designing the layout for the garden, he wanted each part to represent how people deal with losing someone to suicide.
“There are four functions of the garden,” he 
said. “It’s a place for someone to go to honor their loved one, a place for healing and forgive-
ness, a place for supporting others and finding 
support, and a place to find calmness.”
Adams said the garden’s “symbolic de-
sign” includes a gathering space, a labyrinth and a bench by a creek, all of which symbolize the stages of grief survivors face.
A life-size basalt sculpture with six col-
umns that stands in the garden, designed by Greg Johnson, was created to symbolize how each individual affected by a suicide can be-long to a greater group, Johnson said.
“Each is individuated … but they relate to 
each other as people relate to their loss,” he said.
The idea for the garden was hatched al-
most a decade ago when the park opened, said Gladys Cofrin, former owner of the park prop-erty; however, the construction on the garden began about two years ago. 
The Friends of the Crisis Center, in con-
junction with the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department, and the Alachua County Crisis Center part-nered to create the garden.
Wendy Brant, the president of Friends of 
the Crisis Center, said the garden was “truly built by angels — both seen and unseen,” and will now be a special place for survivors. Memorial garden in park dedicated to survivors of suicide

A reported revenge plot 
on the car of an ex-boyfriend’s 
lover landed one local woman in jail Thursday morning.
Gainesville Police arrest-
ed Hub cook Tiffany Marie Ebanks, 27, on charges of bur-glary and criminal mischief, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 2:30 a.m., Ebanks 
broke into Franki Renee Bull-ock’s car in the parking lot of Gator Place Condominiums, at 4000 SW 23rd St., according to the report.
Ebanks opened a container 
of oil in the car and poured it on the seats and side panels, then onto the windows outside of the car. She scratched into the car’s 
paint in sev-eral places and etched 
“b****” on the 
passenger-side door.
Police connected Ebanks to 
the incident after collecting fin-gerprints from the car and the oil container, according to the report.
She told officers she caused 
the about $1,000 worth of dam-age to the car because she was angry with Bullock for dating her ex-boyfriend, according to the report.
Officers booked Ebanks into 
the Alachua County Jail.Police: Hub employee

For the seventh year in a row, the Florida 
Museum of Natural History is hosting its an-
nual Starry Night event tonight.
Laura Caicedo, the marketing and public 
relations assistant at the museum, said there is 
something for everyone at the free, astronomy-
themed event.
From 6 to 10 p.m. students can speak with 
experts from different astronomy programs to learn about the universe, said Amanda Har-
vey, an educator at the center for science learn-
ing at the museum.
“It’s a really good way to sort of get an in-
troduction to astronomy and space science,” she said.At 7 p.m. visitors will be able listen to UF’s 
astronomy department’s chair, professor Ra-fael Guzmán, speak about the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS, the largest optical telescope on Earth, she said.
Vicky Sarajedini, an associate professor 
in the astronomy department at UF, said her department has developed a new interactive activity it calls create-a-crater. People will drop objects in a tub filled with a sand mixture and see what kind of craters they can make. 
Over the years, the portable planetarium 
that Sarajedini helps run has become a staple.
The show will start off displaying the night 
sky over Gainesville, then demonstrate sky movements.
The event will also have 3-D AstroWall 
presentations, which start out at the sun and then go through the galaxy, and viewers will be able to see how stars are positioned, Sara-jedini said.
Harvey said everyone also gets a passport to 
the universe, a map of everything at the event and a place for patrons to collect stamps. A 
completed passport will earn visitors a prize.Star light, star bright at the

UF students don’t always make 
memes, but when they do, they’re in 
Lindsey Woodworth’s economics class.
Public economics instructor and 
Ph.D. candidate Woodworth created a 
Facebook group for her students to post 
memes about public economics, which are paired with an assigned paper.
Woodworth said she got the idea of 
creating memes for homework from an-other professor at a conference.
“It’s a good way to think about it in 
a fun way,” she said. She added that by sharing economics-based memes, it in-
grains the concepts they are learning in 
the students’ minds.She said she wanted to create home-
work that gets students to be more cre-ative. 
“It’s a more fun type of homework 
assignment,” she said. “We usually do a lot of math.”
Part of the assignment is to post the 
memes to the group, where students will vote for their favorite one by liking it. Woodworth said the one with the most likes will get extra credit.
Jason Wasserman, a 20-year-old eco-
nomics junior in Woodworth’s class, said he enjoyed the assignment.
“My first thought when we got as-
signed it was I thought it would be very entertaining,” he said.
Wasserman has already created and 
posted his meme.
“It shows professor Woodworth un-
derstands us,” he said. “She’s trying to appeal to us and make it fun.”UF economics students

A 42-year-old woman died Wednesday 
morning after strong winds caused a 100-foot 
tree to fall onto a mobile home where she and her family lived in southwest Gainesville.
The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce re-
ceived a call at about 2:20 a.m. from Michael Braton, who said a large tree fell through his house at 6904 SW 33rd Place, and that he and his girlfriend, Dawn Ewing, were pinned to their bed and trapped in the bedroom.
Deputies, Alachua County Fire Rescue of-
ﬁ  cials and three men from tree removal com-pany Langston Tree responded. They used air bags and braces to lift the approximately 10-ton tree about 14 inches off of the couple, which was enough room for ofﬁ  cials to pull them off the bed.
Braton, 40, received several injuries, in-
cluding broken bones, said ASO spokesman Art Forgey. Ewing, however, died from being crushed by the tree. Authorities also rescued three children, ages 5, 9 and 12, who were on 
the opposite side of the house when the tree 
fell, Forgey said. They weren’t injured.Paramedics took Braton to UF Health 
Shands Hospital, where doctors took him into surgery. He remained hospitalized Thursday.
Wes Langston, who owns Langston Tree, 
said Wednesday’s incident was an unusual call for him and his crew.
“I have never taken trees off of people,” 
Langston said. “That’s something I hope to never have to do again.”
Ofﬁ  cials determined heavy winds caused 
the tree to topple onto the house. Forgey said the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce received more calls through-out the day about fallen trees around the city. None of the calls resulted in injuries.
At Braton and Ewing’s house Thursday, 
the tree remained lodged on top of the couple’s bed among broken pieces of metal, ﬁ  berglass and wood. Clothes, debris and furniture sat untouched outside the house. A notice taped on the front door from Alachua County Ani-mal Services stated two cats and a pit bull mix had been removed from the property.
Gussie Clayton, who lives near the house 
with her 68-year-old husband, Louis, said she woke up Wednesday morning to what she thought was thunder. She checked outside but saw nothing. She didn’t ﬁ  nd out about the tree falling on her neighbor’s house until later.
The 73-year-old said she’s known Braton, 
Ewing and their children since they recently moved into the house down the road. 
“They seem to be really nice people,” she 
said. “I just wish (the incident) hadn’t hap-pened.”

Authorities can develop clearer statistics about rape in Gainesville
Users can offer as much or as little information as they 
choose, but more detailed reports will help police follow trends, 
Benck said. Authorities can also develop clearer statistics about rape in Gainesville, especially because many incidents are his-torically believed to go unreported.
“We actually hope to get a better picture of what our victim 
demographics look like and what our suspect demographics look like,” she said. “We can potentially at least see areas of town where we should be concentrating efforts.”
As with most anonymous reporting systems, there is a 
concern people will ﬁ  le false reports, Benck added. However, “that’s trivial compared to all the good that it will do.”
Already, Benck said, a victim’s advocate asked her when 
the website would launch because a victim expressed interest in using it. Benck and Kalt said they hope many more victims will see the website as an outlet and take advantage of the re-
sources.
“If they can get it out and start realizing they can trust peo-
ple with their story,” Benck said, “the chances that they’re go-
ing to heal and live a productive life will greatly increase.”WEBSITE , from page 1FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

a pile of blankets, a mug of cocoa and a Netﬂ  ix binge sound way more appealing than class. But you’re all champs: You went to class, you studied hard and now it’s Friday. Treat yo’self to a peppermint mocha latte, and enjoy this week’s 
edition of... 
Darts & Laurels
Our hearts continue to go out to the people of the Philip-
pines who’ve dealt with loss, injury, hunger and sorrow as 
a result of Typhoon Haiyan. In this tragic time, many coun-
tries and organizations have pooled their resources to donate 
money, food, water, medical supplies and volunteer person-nel to help the people of the Philippines start to recover. This week, we’re giving a LAUREL to anyone who helped out, 
whether they packed up and traveled to the Philippines to help out in person or donated to the Red Cross.
So, the Healthcare.gov website is still hella broken. If 
you haven’t left your blanket cave this week, you may have missed the fact that politicians, insurance companies and pri-
vate citizens are freaking out. A seemingly endless stream 
of issues has plagued the health care exchange system from the get-go: the website failed internal tests, President Barack Obama misled citizens by telling them they could keep their 
insurance if they liked, the task of building the website was 
outsourced to the U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian IT company and the federal government basically just sucks at technology systems. Hoo boy. A DART to the president this week for 
poor planning.
Another government DART this week to the Food and 
Drug Administration, which apparently hates doughnuts, aka all that’s good and beautiful in the world. Last week, the FDA proposed a ban on trans fat, in particular, hydrogenated 
oil.
On the surface, the ban seems beneﬁ  cial: Hydrogenated 
oils, which are used to increase the shelf life of most processed 
foods, are bad for you. No one is under any illusions about that fact, and many products boast “No Trans Fats” labels.
However, a lot of things are bad for you — smoking ciga-
rettes, drinking soda, wearing stiletto shoes too long and consuming too much alcohol. It’s not the government’s job to regulate behavior, as libertarians like to point out. And they 
have a point. The FDA should instead promote transparency 
among food companies that use hydrogenated oils in their products rather than banning them altogether.
And, ﬁ  nally, a LAUREL to Hawaii, which will now join 
the ranks of states that allow gay marriage. On Thursday, ac-
cording to the Los Angeles Times, a Hawaiian judge — who  
is just a regular judge that wears a hula skirt and coconut bra instead of robes — refused to block Hawaii’s same-sex mar-riage law.
Congratulations to same-sex couples in Hawaii who can 
now have the winter beach weddings of their dreams.

America’s most controversial law enforcer will 
soon prove himself worthy of his title. 
In his latest attempt to smear Arizona’s 
reputation, Joe Arpaio, the sheriff of Maricopa County, has stated he intends to punish prisoners who deface the American ﬂ  ag.
The ﬂ  ag will appear in jail cells and the national 
anthem will be played as part of Arpaio’s ongoing publicity campaign. 
The sheriff’s futile attempts at patriotism aren’t the 
most disturbing aspect of this campaign, however. 
Arpaio has stated that those who deface the ﬂ  ag will 
be subject to a strict diet of bread and water.
The sheriff went on to boast that 10 people are already 
being denied anything but bread and water. 
His recent ideas for punishment are nothing new. He made his obsession with food public when he 
declared inmates would now have to pay for their meals earlier this year.
However, Arpaio’s tendencies are by no means 
limited to dietary restrictions, as he has been the subject of a number of scandals. 
Known for making prisoners in his jurisdiction wear 
pink underwear, Arpaio has repeatedly clashed with the government over highly politicized issues.
For instance, he launched an investigation of the 
president.
He questioned whether President Barack Obama was 
born in the United States.
He argued the certiﬁ  cate produced by Obama was a 
“computer-generated forgery.” 
Such statements have become synonymous with 
a dissatisﬁ  ed Republican party, but this behavior is dangerous when adopted by a public ofﬁ  cer.
As a bureaucrat, the sheriff has an obligation to be 
impartial to politics. 
Arpaio has instead embraced his partisan instincts.He’s also pursued a political 
agenda. 
Manifesting in the most 
hideous form, Arpaio’s most infamous campaign has been to consistently target Hispanic people.
A judge ruled earlier this year 
that Arpaio’s self-appointed 
ﬁ  ght against undocumented immigrants led to racial proﬁ  ling. 
According to ABC News, the Arizona sheriff’s 
methods permitted his deputies to pull over and search the vehicles of anyone they thought was an illegal immigrant.
Luckily, his powers to implement immigration laws 
were suspended by the government. 
Yet the pink-underwear-loving 81-year-old has 
continued to get re-elected.
He is now serving his sixth term as sheriff-elect. The only difference this time is the sheriff’s re-election 
means someone will only be able to eat bread and water every day.
Being incarcerated shouldn’t mean being starved, 
especially in the United States, regardless of what inmates do to a ﬂ  ag. 
Similarly, being elected as the sheriff of a certain 
county doesn’t grant one the right to breach the neutrality the bureaucracy requires.
The agenda used by the sheriff to humiliate, harass 
and even starve people is nothing more than un-American. 
If government has any sense, it will provoke legal action 
against Arpaio and challenge the legality of depriving people of certain foods in a prison environment.

Students should know the facts about 
education reform
Chances are if you’re reading this, you 
have student loan debt. You may have a fed-
eral subsidized or unsubsidized loan, a loan through your school, or your parents may have even taken out a Direct PLUS Loan to 
help cover the costs of your education. I have 
a twin sister attending Florida State Universi-ty, so I happen to have all of the above. I have federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, and my parents have taken out loans in order to pay for housing and books. 
I was proud to stand behind President 
Barack Obama at the White House when he 
spoke about college affordability on May 31. 
Obama is committed to making college afford-able for every student who wants to receive higher education. In August, the president rolled out even more ideas for higher-educa-tion reform that will help millions of students across the United States. The following are the three main points of reform:
1. Implement a new rating system for col-
leges and universities. The rating system will be based on the institution’s ability to give 
students a strong education at a fair price. 
2. Provide incentives to schools experi-
menting to save student’s money with on-
line courses and joint programs with high schools. 
3. Raise awareness of the “Pay As You 
Earn” program, which caps loan payments at 10 percent of a student’s post-college month-ly income. This program is already helping about 2.5 million students across the country. 
As Obama said, “Higher education 
shouldn’t be a luxury, or a roll of the dice; it’s an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.”

Letter to the Editor
“If you like your health care 
plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. 
Period.”
How many times did we 
hear that? In the Rose Garden, during the State of the Union address, in the pressroom, on the campaign trail and in his weekly Internet addresses, President Ba-rack Obama told us this. And we believed him. So much so that he was re-elected in a decisive victory over Gov. Romney in 2012. This phrase embodied the Affordable Care Act — at least until last week.
Americans are being told they will not 
be able to keep their health plan. Millions of people are opening letters saying Obamac-are has made their policies illegal. My own father was told by his employer that his company will have to look for a new plan because theirs was deemed subpar. This must be a ﬂ  uke. It must be a problem the government didn’t foresee. 
But it isn’t. And it wasn’t. Last week, 
several media outlets began reporting that, as Obama touted his famous phrase, the White House was estimating about seven million people would lose insurance. They knew. We were told otherwise. In fact, Marc A. Thiessen of The Washington Post wrote Obama’s aides advised him to tweak his tagline. It was mis-leading. They knew, from day one, Americans would lose in-surance. Yet the line stayed.
As expected, the Obama ad-
ministration has responded to the issue. It says any plan enacted before the law was passed would be left untouched for another year. What the administration failed to men-tion was if the plan changed in any way — Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services, testiﬁ  ed that an increase of $5 constituted a change — the plan was 
no longer protected. How could they expect 
a plan to stay completely unchanged over three years? So why mislead the American people?
Easy. If they actually knew they would 
lose their insurance, their opinion of the plan would sour. They would use their vote to change things. But that didn’t happen, and they didn’t know. And here we are to-
day. Prices are going up for plans. Families 
are losing their doctors. This is what I, and the American people, must live through. People can’t keep their plans, and the White House knew from the beginning. Period.

Obamacare tagline misleadsGuest column
On Tuesday I attended 
an event hosted by the Jewish National Fund 
titled Making the World a Better Place, which was supposed to 
highlight the positive impact Israel is sup-
posedly making on the global community.
The JNF (also known as the KKL) owns 
13 percent of the land in Israel. Since the 1950s, the JNF has operated as a part of Israel and controls about 93 percent of the land. The JNF’s constitution explicitly states that JNF-KKL land and property is not to be rented, leased, sold or worked by non-Jews.
So you could see why I was surprised 
that such a discriminatory organization was allowed to come on campus by UF Intercul-tural Engagement. 
The event sought to whitewash the op-
pression and discrimination inﬂ  icted on Pal-estinians and other ethnic groups by high-lighting Israel’s green efforts and medical technologies. You want to know how Israel 
can truly make the world a better place?
1. Stop its settler colonial project that has ethnically cleansed Palestinians 
from their land since 1948.
2. Afﬁ  rm the right of return 
to more than 4.25 million Pal-estinians who were displaced 
from their land and reside in refugee camps in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
3. Stop the Prawer Plan, which seeks to 
displace more than 40,000 bedouins. 
4. Stop placing Palestinian children as 
young as 9 in military detention centers. 
5. End its discrimination against Pales-
tinians with Israeli citizenship and against African migrants.
6. Stop playing such a huge role in the 
military industrial complex, which greatly harms the global South.
7. Stop threatening sovereign nations 
with the threat of military strikes, and
8. Realize that an ethnocracy can’t call 
itself the only democracy in the Middle East when it only represents one group of people.

Local nonproﬁ  ts and students are stepping up 
to offer relief for victims of the devastating typhoon 
that hit the Philippines last week.
The American Red Cross is accepting donations 
through its local branch. Melanie Saxon, the execu-
tive director of the American Red Cross North Cen-
tral Florida Chapter, said it is using social media to inform people of the need for aid.
“The disaster is so huge, and there will be large 
sums of money needed,” she said. “Locally, we have people contacting us looking for loved ones in the Philippines. We deﬁ  nitely can help with that.”
Some restaurants are also chipping in.Sushi Chao, Hiro Asian Sandwich Bistro, three 
Mochi locations and both Bento Cafe locations will donate 20 percent of their sales Monday night. The donation period will run from 5 p.m. to close.
Kellen Wright, a 20-year-old UF anthropology ju-
nior, is a UF Health Shands Hospital nursing assis-tant who has a connection to the Philippines through her co-workers.
“They are like my second mothers,” Wright said. 
“They are the generation who moved to Gainesville, but they have a strong connection to their original home in the Philippines.”
When hearing of the tragedy that happened in 
her co-workers’ country, Wright decided to act as a liaison between the nurses and her sorority.
With the help of her Alpha Delta Pi sisters, 
Wright has been collecting toys, money, clothes and 
other items to send to the Philippines.
“I think when you have the opportunity to help 
people, you should take it,” she said. “It makes the 
world go ’round.”
Jade Castro, a 19-year-old UF journalism sopho-
more who has family in the Philippines, said she be-lieves Gainesville efforts can make a difference.
“The Philippines needs to recover,” she said. 
“And they don’t have the resources to do it them-selves.”Locals donate to

Santa Fe College received a grant 
from the Walmart Foundation to provide 
low-income adults and older youth with skills to obtain middle-skill-level jobs.
SFC was one of 12 community schools 
that collectively received the $3.5 million grant.
Each school will receive $233,333 to 
use in teaching programs targeted at people who do not have a high school de-gree, are from low-income households or speak English as their second language. 
Areas of the program include career 
counseling and job acquisition skills such as job search, resume writing, and inter-
viewing techniques. Other programs in-
clude focusing on literacy, mathematics, computer technology and communica-tions, said Julie Falt, SFC coordinator of adult education programs.
“It’s a support network for people 
to be able to make it on their own,” she said.
The program will kick off in January.Heather Rouse, a 19-year-old SFC in-
dustrial biotechnology senior, said she understands the hardships of ﬁ  nding jobs given the economy.
“I can relate to others who struggle to 
ﬁ  nd a job because of the lack of skills or experience,” she said. “The grant will be able to prepare students for the future.”SFC gets grant to help residents get jobsLOCAL

Mark Parrish and Florida 
cross country begin the NCAA Championships today. Read the story on page 16. Gators captains 
Will Muschamp announced via Twitter that Cody Riggs, Jon Halapio, Vernon Hargreaves III and Jarrad Davis will serve as captains against South Carolina.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Jarrad Davis was not the 
highest-recruited linebacker the 
Gators signed in their 2013 re-
cruiting class, but he has made 
the biggest immediate impact.
Due to solid play on spe-
cial teams and injuries to the 
Florida (4-5, 3-4 Southeastern 
Conference) linebacker corps, the Kingsland, Ga., native will likely make his first career start against No. 10 South Carolina 
on Saturday at 7 p.m. in Colum-
bia, S.C.
“We thought he was a re-
ally good player bringing him in,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “The more you’re 
around, the more you see him, 
we’re pleasantly surprised. He is a guy who is very mature.”
Davis made an impact on 
the staff with his play on spe-
cial teams, but he received little 
playing time on defense. His statistics hide his true impact — the freshman has recorded only 
seven tackles, including one for 
a loss, in nine games played.
But Davis’ maturity has im-
pressed his coaches the most — enough for Durkin to compare 
him to another true freshman 
who has made a large impact on the Florida defense.
“We’ve (talked) about [fresh-
man defensive back Vernon Har-greaves III] a bunch as a fresh-
man who handles things well 
and doesn’t act like a freshman,” Durkin said. “I think Jarrad goes 
into that same category.
“He just handles himself in a way that, if you didn’t know, you wouldn’t think he’s a fresh-
man. That’s in the meeting rooms, off the field, on the field. He prepares really hard, prac-
tices well.”
The Gators need Davis’ prac-
tice ability to translate to the 
playing field against the Game-cocks (7-2, 5-2 SEC) on Satur-
day.
UF lost starting Mike line-
backer Antonio Morrison to a 
torn meniscus suffered during 
Florida’s 34-17 loss to Vander-
bilt on Saturday. Despite strug-gling at times during the season, Morrison — UF’s leading tackler — started the past seven games 
and played a key role leading 
the Gators’ defense.
“He gets guys lined up. He 
communicates to everyone on 
the defensive side of the ball,” 
Durkin said. “There’s a lot of things you lose with him.”
Redshirt junior Michael Tay-
lor, who previously started at 
Will linebacker, will take over 
Morrison’s role; Davis will re-place Taylor and serve as one of four captains before the game starts.
“We’ve also reached a point 
right now where … we’ve been there,” Durkin said. “You know, it’s part of what’s going on … No one really talks about it or 
feels bad about it. In terms of 
us for a team, we just got to go move on.”

Sitting at 4-5 with a likely loss 
ahead of them in Columbia, S.C., the Gators could easily be batting 
.400 by weekend’s end. With that pos-sibility in mind, as well as our nation’s recent observance of Veterans Day — thank you for your service — we here at 
the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column 
would like to talk about Ted Williams — Teddy Ballgame — the last man to bat better than .400 in Major League Baseball.
While Williams’ .400 — actually .406 
— is much better than a .400 would be on Florida’s end, we think this Hall of Famer had several bits of wisdom that would do the Gators good.
Will these quotes be out of context? 
How could you even ask such a ques-tion?
Of course these quotes will be taken 
out of context.
So, sit back, relax and get ready for 
some “Ted Talk!” (See what we did there?)
1. “If you don’t think too good, 
don’t think too much.”
Put simply, this tells dumb people 
to avoid thinking too hard. But there’s a deeper meaning here. Read what de-
fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said 
on Wednesday: “You can’t let circum-stances define where you’re at and what you’re doing.” Below .500 and reeling, it’s probably hard for UF to “think good” and push away the bad 
thoughts. So, quit the thinking, go out 
there and play your game!
2. “If there was ever a man born to 
be a hitter, it was me.”
Are the Gators simply going to lie 
down and let good old Ted be the only hitter out there? Somebody tell us right now that Dante Fowler Jr. isn’t a hitter. Somebody tell us that Loucheiz Purifoy 
isn’t a hitter. Hell, Jarrad Davis is “a guy 
who sticks his face in the fan,” accord-ing to Will Muschamp. We damn well know he’s a hitter. Go out there and hit 
somebody — legally!Picks

The suspension of Scottie Wilbekin to 
start the season pushed Kasey Hill into the 
starting point guard role for the Gators. 
Through two games, the freshman has 
had his share of struggles. 
Hill is tied for 150th in the nation with 
four assists per game, and his 13 missed 
shots are the most on the Gators.
However, he will have an opportunity 
to turn things around for No. 11 Florida 
against Arkansas-Little Rock on Saturday at 4:30 p.m. in the O’Connell 
Center.
Hill’s first road trip of 
his collegiate career ended with a 59-53 loss to No. 20 Wisconsin. Shooting 2 of 11 and fouling out with 3:25 
in the game did not help 
his cause. 
Coach Billy Donovan said Hill’s poor 
shooting performance not only contributed 
to him fouling out during a critical point of 
the game, but it also hurt his defensive play as well.“I thought his lack of putting the ball in 
the basket really impacted him on the defen-
sive end of the floor, being a young guy and 
all,” Donovan said. “He was visibly disap-pointed, upset, bothered. That led to some of his foul trouble. He has to be able to move to the next play.”
For the first time since Nick Calathes 
made his debut in 2007, the Gators started a freshman at point guard to open the season. In Calathes’ first two games of his career, he 
averaged 18 points per game on 43 percent 
shooting. He also averaged 5.5 assists.Freshman guard off to slow start for Gators“He just handles himself 
in a way that, if you didn’t 
know, you wouldn’t think 
he’s a freshman.”

THE RALLY
Each week, two alligator-
Sports columnists will debate the biggest looming 
matchup in college football. To-
day, Phillip Heilman and Adam 
Pincus preview No. 25 Georgia’s road matchup against No. 7 Au-
burn on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on 
CBS.
Phillip: What a difference a year makes.After going winless in Southeastern Conference 
play last season, including a 38-0 loss to Georgia — 
the ﬁ  rst time Auburn had been shut out at home since 
2003 — the Tigers have bounced back.
However, their resurgence is going to hit a snag 
this week with the Bulldogs in town.
Georgia has won the past two meetings between 
these teams by a combined score of 83-7. I don’t be-lieve the margin of victory will be that impressive this 
time around, but the Bulldogs are going to keep their 
SEC Eastern Division title hopes alive with a critical victory.
Having recovered from a rough patch during the 
middle of October, Georgia is starting to resemble 
the team that was a play away from the national title 
game last season.
Todd Gurley, who was out for both of the Bull-
dogs’ SEC losses after suffering a sprained ankle in a win against LSU, has returned and looks like one of the nation’s top tailbacks. Going against an Auburn defense that is allowing more than 150 rushing yards per game, I expect Gurley to do enough to help his 
team win.
Come on, Pincus, you can’t really expect Auburn 
to win this game. Cam Newton doesn’t even play for 
them anymore, you dope! 
Adam: What Auburn does have is what I like to call 
the Spread Eagle offense. The Tigers score 39 points and gain 493.3 yards a game. That yardage number is second only to Johnny Manziel’s Aggies in the SEC. 
Quarterback Nick Marshall will have his Tigers 
ready to play. This is his ﬁ  rst Auburn-Georgia game as a quarterback since he transferred from UGA in 2012. Marshall and two teammates were found steal-ing from a teammate. UGA coach Mark Richt gave him the boot, forcing Marshall to attend Garden City (Kan.) Community College. This is his redemption game!
As a quarterback, Marshall has rushed for 734 
yards. Running back Tre Mason has 1,038 yards him-self. That’s quite the duo in the backﬁ  eld. Not a good combination for a Georgia team that, depending on who you talk to, may or may not have outgrown its yearly late-season woes. I know these situations are completely different, but since you brought up Newton I must ask: Sound familiar?
Phillip: That does sound 
eerily familiar.
However, I don’t think 
Marshall is nearly as talented 
as Newton is now or was dur-
ing his one season with the Ti-
gers. It does sound like Marshall also lacks common sense, though.  
Anyway, if you want to talk about quality signal-
callers, look no further than Aaron Murray.
Georgia’s quarterback, a senior who did not have 
to go to community college to learn to not steal things, is second in the conference in passing and has only gotten better as the season has gone on. Auburn has 
proven to be susceptible against strong passing at-
tacks — the Tigers are 11th in the conference in pass-
ing defense — despite having faced only one of the 
SEC’s better quarterbacks this season.
Murray should have a ﬁ  eld day.
Meanwhile, Georgia’s defense, which will certain-
ly need to limit Mason to win the game, is fourth in 
the conference against the run. The Bulldogs looked 
pretty stout while bottling up Kelvin Taylor in Jack-sonville, and I expect them to do the same Saturday to send the Tigers spiraling.
Auburn has had a friendly schedule to this point, 
but starting this week (and especially after playing against Alabama in two weeks to end the season) the fairy tale will come crashing down. 
Adam: The Gators don’t belong in the same con-
versation, let alone the same sentence, as these two teams. Against top-25 teams this year, Georgia has al-lowed 161 rushing yards per game and boast a typical 2-2 record. These ‘Dawgs are inconsistent — whether it be because of injuries or Murray’s bazooka of a right arm.
I’m also not picking against Gus Malzahn’s now-
humming offense that’s clicking on all cylinders. He may be off the Christmas card list for Florida fans for introducing the Wildcat to college football (sorry, Trey!), but he has turned Auburn into a force in the SEC. 
Auburn is college football’s most improved team 
record wise and will show it on the ﬁ  eld come Sat-urday in another edition of the Deep South’s Oldest Rivalry. While researching things to do in Auburn, Ala., I came across the “slush bus,” which is a shuttle service provided by The Supper Club bar that drives patrons home until 5 a.m. 
How can you not like a team that plays in a town 
with that?Who will win the UGA-AU game?

The third time is not al-
ways the charm. 
It certainly was not for the 
Gators on Thursday night in 
Blacksburg, Va.
Failing to recover from a 
disastrously bad ﬁ  rst half, Florida lost its ﬁ  rst road game of the season, falling to Vir-ginia Tech 71-59.
“We were on our heels 
defensively for most of the night,” coach Amanda Butler said. “That was just so hard to 
overcome.”
After Florida was out-
rebounded in its previous 
game, against North Florida, Butler knew her team would face a challenge against the Hokies, who entered the game with a +18 rebound margin.
Fortunately for Florida, re-
bounding was not an issue. 
However, almost every-
thing else was.
Florida’s defense was po-
rous in the ﬁ  rst half, allow-ing 39 points on 43.3 percent shooting, as the Gators trailed by 24 points going into half-time.
As poorly as the defense 
played, the offense was just as shaky.
Hokies freshman guard 
Vanessa Panousis had 18 points in the ﬁ  rst half. Florida had 15.
“She did a fantastic job to-
day,” Butler said of Panousis. 
“She set the tone from the be-
ginning and we were adjust-ing, continuously, to her. That was certainly not our game plan.”
Virginia Tech’s (3-0) hot 
shooting coupled with Flori-da’s inability to put points on the board spelled disaster for the Gators. UF was plagued by a six-minute scoreless drought in the ﬁ  rst half and 
shot 4 of 24 from the ﬁ  eld be-
fore halftime. 
But Florida (2-1) was a 
different team in the second half.
R o n n i 
Williams be-gan to dom-inate the 
ﬂ  oor like she 
did in the Gators’ sea-son opener against Bet-hune-Cook-
man. Before fouling out with 3:30 remaining in the game, Williams recorded seven re-
bounds and seven points.
“I thought Ronni really 
sparked us in the second 
half,” Butler said. “No ques-tion. She really battled and turned the momentum. Kayla (Lewis) had some big plays as well, but Virginia Tech an-swered.”
Florida pulled within four 
points with 6:51 remaining in the game, but the early deﬁ  -cit proved too much to over-come.
Seniors Jaterra Bonds and 
Lily Svete each had strong performances. Bonds led the team with 21 points, while Svete made four threes to ﬁ  n-ish the game with 12 points. 
“After playing such an em-
barrassing ﬁ  rst half, it was too much to overcome,” Butler said. “I was really proud of 
the ﬁ  ght and the toughness 
that they showed in the sec-ond half. ... Ultimately, our demise in the second half was that we gave up big plays.  
A radio broadcast contributed 
to this report. Slow start dooms 
Gators in road loss
Williams
Hill is averaging 9.5 points 
per game on 35 percent shoot-
ing, while averaging four as-
sists. 
Before the season started, 
Hill said he was a pass-first 
player. But with 20 shots so 
far, he has as many attempts 
as Patric Young, Will Yeguete and Jacob Kurtz combined.
There has not been a Florida 
team with fewer assists in the 
first two games of the season 
than this year’s squad since at least 1998. But Donovan, who was a point guard during his 
playing career at Providence, 
said he understands how dif-ficult it is for Hill to manage a team as a freshman. With no other true point guard on the active roster, Hill is forced to carry the load in the back-
court.
“Obviously I’ve put him 
in a very difficult situation,” 
Donovan said. 
“The fact that he’s a fresh-
man and we don’t have another point guard right now on our team, and he’s got to absorb a lot of minutes. He’s kind of having to learn on the job, and 
I’m not so sure that’s the fairest 
thing to him. So there’s going 
to be some growing pains and 
some bumps and bruises on the way.”
With the season opener and 
the first road game out  of the 
way, Donovan said he expects 
Hill to take what he learned and immediately start growing into a better player. Florida’s next three games are at home against mid-major schools.
“This is a good experience 
for him,” Donovan said. “Just the way he’s being guarded, what people are doing to him and how he needs to attack and play.”
running backs such as LSU’s Jeremy Hill, Mis-souri’s Henry Josey and Georgia’s Todd Gurley 
to shred its run defense. During UF’s four-game 
losing streak, opponents ran for an average of 165.5 yards per game.
“I felt really good going into the season with 
where we were,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“Certainly, we’ve not had the results we want-
ed to consistently through the year, and that’s been frustrating.”
Florida has its work cut out for it again 
against South Carolina.
Gamecocks running back Mike Davis is the 
SEC’s leading rusher and has already scored 10 rushing touchdowns.
“He is having an outstanding year, certainly 
has been a huge different in their run game,” Muschamp said.
Added Durkin: “He’s a powerful guy, breaks 
tackles. He’s got some top-end speed. He’s hit some long ones on teams where maybe because of his size or whatever he doesn’t look like a 
speed guy, but he’s got speed. 
“He can break it.”3. “They invented the All-Star 
Game for Willie Mays.”
Here is Florida’s most significant 
challenge of all. In order to get back 
on track, the Gators need to — BA-HAHA! The quote’s about Willie Mays! I honestly cannot believe you 
read that far expecting to gain some 
actual wisdom from that. Good grief.
To those of you making the trip to 
Steve Spurrier’s home of nine years, 
have a safe journey. For those of y’all 
staying home, try to make it through Saturday without firing coach Mus-champ, OK? Jeremy Foley can’t do 
GatorZone interviews every week.
Today, we have Joe Morgan and 
Adam Pincus debating the Duke-
Miami matchup.
Forget .406! The Blue Devils (+3) 
will have the ‘Canes dialing 4-1-1 because…
Miami cannot remember its last 
loss to Duke. Break out the record books and tell Coach K to take a backseat and police tanking NBA teams a little bit longer because Da-vid Cutcliffe is currently the king of 
Durham.
- Joe Morgan
Duke will call Miami (-3) the 
greatest hitter to ever play the game 
because…
These Blue Devils are in for one 
hell of a reality check. The U does 
not lose to frickin’ Duke! Are you 
out of your mind? Go home, Joe! You’re drunk.
- Adam Pincus
Now onto the picks!
Still leading the pack at 52-31-5 
is alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe 
“Steve SPILL-berg” Morgan, who slipped and fell while walking through his apartment this week. 
Hey, Joe. Disney put out a casting 
call for Star Wars: Episode VII this week. They need an actor to play the Stormtrooper who dies first.
Tied for first is alligatorSports As-
sistant Editor Adam “Butt Fumble” Lichtenstein, who had the audacity to wear a Mark Sanchez jersey in the office this week. We know you’re hard on yourself, but have some self-respect, man. Besides, it’s Geno Smith’s team now!
Next up at 49-34-5 is alligator-
Sports Editor Phillip “Holier Than Thou” Heilman, who recently decid-ed to impart some life lessons while 
playing Madden on Xbox Live. Lis-
ten, bud. When you follow up some sage advice by eating a potato chip off your bare chest, it’s hard to take you seriously. That’s the Buddha’s 
shtick, man!
A few games back but still in the 
hunt at 45-38-5 is alligatorSports Staff Writer Adam “When’s the 
press conference start?” Pincus, who still texts his colleagues to figure out the media schedule despite this year being his second covering Gators 
football. Repeat after me, Pincus: cal-
en-dar.
Tied with Pincus is FightinGa-
tors.com’s Cody “Omaha bound!” Jones, who spent Wednesday tweet-ing all about Florida baseball’s sign-ing class. We know you’re looking for the next Mike Zunino, Cody, but 
you can give it a break. Baseball sea-
son isn’t for a few more months.
Maintaining a shred of respect-
ability at 44-39-5 is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “B.B. Kingpin” Thompson, who was busted back in his youth for firing his BB gun at unsuspecting targets. Who needs 
drone strikes when you’ve got this 
guy wandering around?
Finally out of the cellar at 43-40-
5 is InsideTheGators.com’s Bryan “Good job! Good effort!” Holt, who made a point of congratulating Van-derbilt fans for last weekend’s vic-tory against Florida. How dare you 
betray the orange and blue! What-
ever happened to “GO GATA” ‘til the death of me?
And in dead-ass last with a piss-
poor record of 42-41-5 is 247Sports.com’s Thomas “Ladies’ Night” Gold-kamp, who agreed to let the old ball and chain — ahem, Holt — leave the 
apartment for some fun with friends 
last Saturday night. Good for you, Thomas. It’s important that you each have an identity outside of your rela-
tionship.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After mixed results at the South-
eastern Conference Championships 
on Nov. 1, Florida’s cross country teams are hoping to boast a strong showing today starting at 11 a.m. at 
the NCAA South Regional Cham-
pionships in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Coach Paul Spangler said the 
team has limited the volume of its workouts this week after intensi-fying practice following the SEC Championships.
“Right now, it’s just a matter of 
feeling fresh, maintaining the ﬁ  t-
ness that we have, keeping the ath-
letes healthy and preparing them to run faster,” he said.
The men have momentum go-
ing into regionals after their sec-ond-place ﬁ  nish at the SEC Cham-pionships. 
They do not want to settle for 
second-best again.
“Overall, the team was satis-
ﬁ  ed, but I think that we have more to give,” senior Mark Parrish said. “We’re happy with our ﬁ  tness … but at the same time, we’re looking forward to having some improve-ments at Regions.”
The men will be running a 10K 
for the ﬁ  rst time this season when they compete on the Harry Pritch-ett Running Course today. 
 Even though this will be the 
ﬁ  rst time some of the runners will experience the extended course length as Gators, Spangler said he 
does not believe the extra distance 
will faze the team.
“The training we do is designed 
for them to run fast, whether it’s an 8K or 10K,” he said. “The only thing you worry about is them mentally going into the race, and I know those guys are mentally tough, so I don’t expect it to affect them at all.”
While the men have had consis-
tency from their top four runners 
— Parrish, juniors Jimmy Clark 
and Eddie Garcia and freshman Carlos Miranda — they received an added boost when junior JL Hines returned to the lineup after missing two races this season.
“He’s looked a lot better here in 
practice recently,” Spangler said. 
“We’re excited to see what he 
can do [today]. He’s going to be key for us.”
The women are shaking off 
a fourth-place ﬁ  nish at the SEC Championships — their worst team outing in the event since 2007 — as they prepare for the regional race.
“We’ve left that behind,” red-
shirt senior Agata Strausa said. 
“We’ve acknowledged that 
some teams were better on that day.”
Strausa said that one form of 
motivation for the team to perform well at the SEC Championships was the pride of running on their 
home course.
“We wanted to do well for our 
fans here,” she said. “There was a 
lot of pressure, and it’s not that it’s less pressure at regionals, but at re-gionals, we can race with more risk and just let it all out because this is very important for us to qualify (for the NCAA Championships).”
Strausa was the only Florida 
runner on the women’s side to ﬁ  n-ish in the top 10 in the 119-competi-tor ﬁ  eld two weeks ago. Three of Florida’s ﬁ  ve scoring runners ﬁ  n-ished in 30th place or worse.
They hope to change that out-
come when they run their 6K to-day.
“Cross country depends on a 
daily form, and on that day, there were just other teams that were in a better shape,” Strausa said. “I think we’re all really ﬁ  t and the day will come that we all get it together and have awesome races and, on that day, we will be winners again.”

The Gators can take another step toward 
their 21st Southeastern Conference title to-
night.
No. 5 Florida will play No. 7 Missouri 
at home at 7 with conference-title stakes on 
the line. Despite already facing teams such 
as Penn State and Stanford — two of the top programs in the country — earlier this sea-son, a matchup with the undefeated Tigers could be the Gators’ (23-2, 12-1 SEC) big-gest challenge.
“Friday night, 
it’s going to take the whole kitchen sink (to win),” coach 
Mary Wise said after Wednesday’s three-set victory against South Carolina. “This Mis-souri team is as talented a team that we’ve faced in the O’Connell Center in years.”
Not surprisingly, the Tigers (29-0. 13-0 SEC) currently lead the conference with two weeks remaining in the regular season. A win tonight would put Missouri on the brink of its ﬁ  rst SEC title. 
However, the Gators can put themselves 
in equally strong position with a victory. 
If Florida wins the match in three sets, it 
will own the tiebreaker with Missouri and win the conference title outright barring any losses the rest of the season. 
A win in four sets would cause the tie-
breaker to come down to the points scored in tonight’s match and the Tiger’s four-set victory against the Gators on Oct. 20. 
Wise and her team are in for a challenge 
— starting with Tigers setter Molly Krek-low, who is second in the nation in assists 
per set with 12.7. Kreklow was named to 
the All-SEC Second Team in 2012 behind Florida senior setter Taylor Brauneis. 
“It all starts with their setter,” Wise said. 
“[Kreklow] is one of the best setters in the country, and that offense goes through her and is elite.”
