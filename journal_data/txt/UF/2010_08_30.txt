Wandering goat in Missouri gets fan page on Facebook
MEXICO, Mo.  — A goat that has been 
wandering around the eastern Missouri 
town of Mexico has gained enough atten-tion to have his own Facebook page. But animal control officers are not amused. KXEO reported that the goat was first seen by a motorist on Saturday near an underpass on the east side of town.
Mexico animal control officer Joe 
Horton said the department has received more than a dozen reports of the adult goat being seen around town, including 
in downtown Mexico.
Horton said animal control officers are 
earnestly trying to catch the goat, which 
he’s named Billy Goat Gruff.
Mexico residents are having a bit 
more fun with it. Someone started a Face-
book fan page for the goat, which had 232 
friends as of Friday morning.

The Progress Party has returned.
Led by party President Dave Sch-
neider, the Progress Party registered Thursday morning with the Super -
visor of Elections.
“This is the same Progress Party 
with the same ideas,” Schneider said.
The move comes after the forma-
tion of a Progress Party caucus over the summer. Schneider said the cau-cus was organized because it want-ed to address the Student Senate’s response to issues like the shooting 
of graduate student Kofi Adu-Brem-
pong more seriously.
Schneider said he felt there need-
ed to be a more serious voice in Stu-dent Government.
“Both parties in Student Senate 
are not interested in political par -ticipation among students,” he said “We’re interested in radically chang-ing the system so that it represents every student’s interest.”
Unite Senator and Allocations 
Committee Chairman Ben Meyers said his party has had a great work-ing relationship with the Progress Party in the past.
Meyers noted a collaboration 
from the summer when he and Prog-ress Party Sen. Jose Soto co-authored 
a resolution calling for the formation of a review board to monitor the ac-tions and policies of the University 
Police Department.
“I think there’s a history of coop-
eration between both parties,” Mey-ers said. “We admire the activism of Progress.”
Student Alliance Senate Leader 
Jon Ossip said in terms of having a stake in the election, he hopes there 
aren’t three parties vying for Senate 
seats in this fall’s elections.
“If there are three parties, the 
winner is Unite,” he said.
Senate President Kara Olesky , of 
the Unite Party, said she appreciates all points of view in the Senate, and she feels much more can get done that way.
“I’ve always enjoyed working 
with Progress Party,” she said. “They are a great group of people.”
According to Schneider, the 
Progress Party will have a presence in this semester’s elections.
“We’re most interested in mak-
ing sure students feel represented,” he said.Progress Party is reborn

Orange frosting spelled out “Happy 10th Birthday 
Gator Nights!” on two cakes, and staff wore festive hats Friday to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Gator Nights in the Reitz Union.  
Besides a regular movie showing — this week “Iron 
Man 2” — the night featured a variety of free activities and new performances.
Plastic Musik, a Las Vegas-based percussionist group 
that plays melodies from popular tunes by banging plastic tubes against laundry tubs, metal rails and kiddie pools, treated students to everything from Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face” 
to Mozart’s “Symphony No. 40.”
The performance left many in awe, including sopho-
more Dylan Kimble. 
“It was a combination of super and awesome,” he  said 
after the show. “If Tupac and Blue Man Group had a baby, it would be Plastic Musik.”
Gator Nights, hosted by the Reitz Union every Friday 
at 6 p.m., is open to anyone with a Gator 1 Card.Gator Nights hits

After nearly 10 years of plan-
ning and praying, the Gator Wes-
ley Foundation finally opened its doors to its new center Sunday.
The new building, located at 
1380 W. University Ave.,  is nearly 16,000 square feet in size. It  in-cludes a 5,000-square-foot wor -
ship center and a 1,600-square-foot lounge called the College Room where students can study and so-cialize. 
Speaking to  more than 200 in 
attendance, UF President Bernie 
Machen said the shared goal of 
Gator Wesley and UF is to help students move along in life. 
“We, [together,] seek to develop 
the mind, body and spirit of our young people,” Machen said.
Although the building has been 
open since the beginning of April, church leaders thought a grand opening for the new school year would be better.  
The Rev. David Fuquay, who 
has directed 
Gator Wesley 
since 2006, said 
that while the process was a very long jour -
ney, he is hope-ful that the build-ing will remain a part of the com -
munity for an even longer time. 
 “[These are] things that helped 
us remember where we’ve come from even as we’re moving into a new future,” Fuquay said.Machen christens

The crowd of more than 750 shed its inhibitions and 
started dancing freely in the rain, illuminated only by the 
lights from the stage, while children ran barefoot through the crowd at Bo Diddley Community Plaza Friday night.
The Imposters, a six-piece Beatles cover band, was re-
sponsible for the bustling plaza, as part of Gainesville’s 
“Free Fridays” music series. 
Jeanie Bey said she brings her granddaughter, Ava, to the Friday concerts every chance they get, and she com-
mented on the wide array of people in the plaza. 
Students were scattered among the dancing families 
and seemed to know the words to the music just as well as the adults.
“Every walk of life is here — all demographics come,” 
she said. 
Cassia Laham, a junior at UF, said, “I’ve listened to the 
Beatles my whole life. I knew them before ‘NSYNC and Backstreet Boys.”
The crowd interacted enthusiastically with the band 
members, who took requests and played two encore per -formances. 
They played a blend of Beatles’ classics, Hendrix mas-
terpieces and Dylan’s finest. 
Members called on each other to perform solos, while 
encouraging the crowd to dance along. Even a group of shy teenagers was dancing along by the time the band played “She Loves You.” 
The band was formed in 1984 by Michael Derry and 
Mark Loveland as a tribute to the Beatles. 
“We’ve been together four times longer than The Beat-
les at this point,” Derry said. 
The band has played with the accompaniment of ev-
erything from a string quartet to a choir, and they travel around the state performing once or twice a month.
Derry explained that the Beatles’ enormous popularity 
has contributed to the continuous success of the band. 
While music is the group’s first passion, the band mem-
bers work other jobs in the community and play with a 
variety of other local bands to exercise their various musi-
cal talents. 
The band performs next at a Gainesville Habitat for  
Humanity fundraiser  on Sept. 10.
The “Free Fridays” concert series has brought music 
to Gainesville for 15 years and has greatly increased in 
popularity within the last three years. 
It was started and funded by the City of Gainesville to 
encourage an appreciation for the “amazing musical his-
tory and great local music scene,” said David Ballard, the events coordinator for Parks, Recreation and Cultural Af-
fairs for the city.
Gainesville’s culture is rich with musical history — 
Tom Petty, Bo Diddley and Against Me! are all from the city. 
The program runs every Friday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza and features various  artists playing a range of music from bluegrass to African folk music. 
According to a press release, the season began in May 
and ends Oct. 15. The next show, on Friday, will feature jazz performer Julie Black.

In a salute to one of the world’s 
oldest cultures, Gators for Asha 
hosted the fifth annual Praharsha 
festival on Saturday night.
Performers dressed in Hindi 
garb and swaying to the music from traditional instruments gave students a taste of Indian customs as they danced across the stage. 
The festival was hosted to pro-
mote Indian culture and raise 
awareness of Gators for Asha’s mis-
sion to raise money to fund educa-tion  for underprivileged children in India. 
More than 700 people came to 
take part in the cultural showcase that featured three hours of Indian singing and dancing. 
”It’s the highlight of the year 
for us,”said Lokendra Bengani, treasurer of Gators for Asha.  
Videos and speeches, accompanied by photos and slideshows of chil-dren in Indian schools the group helps to fund, were used in an at-tempt to inspire the members of the audience to volunteer their time with the organization. 
The real energy came from the 
Indian folk dances and customary Hindi songs that showed the di-
versity and dedication of Gators for 
Asha.
Beth Lackey, a member of Desi 
Gators, a dance group that per -
formed in the showcase, said the group had intensive practices for two-and-a-half weeks before its performance.
“This is an experience of a life-
time for me,” she said. “It was so amazing. It was so much fun.”
Ashwin Ramanthan, who 
played violin in the opening jugal-bandi musical act of the festival, said this was his first time playing in the show and hopes he can do it again.
“I’m excited,” he said. “It’s 
my first time performing in front of a Gainesville audience.”  
Priyamka Chandroshekar, a mem-ber of the audience, said she was pleased with the show and its au-thenticity. 
“It was very reminiscent of what 
we see in India,” Chandroshekar said.
Neha Sahwhey, another audi-
ence member, said she thought the group achieved its goal of promot-ing its work with children in India. 
“It is one of the best ways of cre-
ating awareness,” Sahwhey said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 30, 2010

About 350 people took to the 
streets Saturday morning in an 
effort to raise money and aware-
ness during  the Project Haiti 5K run.
The race, which spanned 3.08 
miles, helped raise $6,500 for 
Project Haiti, according to Em-
manuelle Topiol, the leader of the  project. The proceeds will go toward 
the annual Project Haiti medical trip, which will send a group to 
Haiti and the Dominican Repub-
lic in March. 
While on the trip, students, 
faculty and staff from the UF 
College of Medicine and Shands 
Hospital will provide free medi-cal care and everyday necessities to those in need of medical atten-tion. 
Topiol said this was the first time the group has hosted a 5K run as a fundraiser.
“They need us a lot down 
there, so anything we can bring and any support from the UF community helps,” Topiol said.
The race course curved around 
Lake Alice.
The course began along Hull 
Road and came to an end at the Commuter Lot on Gale Lemer -
and Drive.
A giant arch of red and blue 
balloons awaited the runners at the finish line. 
The first male and female 
participants to cross the finish line were each rewarded with a medal. 
In addition to raising money 
from the race, participants also donated about 10 pairs of used running shoes for the group members to take to their patients 
in Haiti.
The Project Haiti group will 
continue collecting shoes and 
other donations until the trip to Haiti and the Dominican Repub-
lic in March. 
Despite the early start at 7:30 
a.m., the runners were ener -
gized. 
“It’s not hard waking up on a 
Saturday when you know it’s for 
something good,” UF senior Ash-ley Kerr said.MONDAY, AUGUST 30, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

For a third-party candidate, everything becomes a 
campaign stop — even lunch at Panera Bread. 
Alex Snitker, the Libertarian Party candidate for U.S. 
Senate running against Republican Marco Rubio, indepen-
dent Charlie Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek, spoke at Panera Bread on Archer Road to a crowd of about 15 on Sunday. 
Snitker, 35, recently quit his job as a salesman to focus 
on the campaign. Even though an August poll showed him winning only 3 percent,  he said he has a chance.
“Deep down, people are looking for someone else,” he 
said.
Nick White, president of the UF Students for the Pres-
ervation of Freedom, said while the club doesn’t endorse candidates, he was going to vote for Snitker, and that  stu-
dents should know about him so they can 
make an informed decision.
Snitker, a former Marine, said he wants 
the government out of people’s lives, and he 
said he doesn’t need a college degree to understand leg-islation.
“The federal government should just follow the con-
stitution, which isn’t a hard document,” he said. “We’ve 
put Harvard and Yale people in office, and look where we’re at.”
Snitker expressed discontent that after defending 
America as a Marine for eight years, he still wasn’t al-lowed to participate in Senate debates, like NBC’s “Meet the Press” this Sunday.
Also at the restaurant was independent Terry Mar -
tin-Beck, who is running for U.S. Congress in District 3 against incumbent Rep. Corrine Brown.
Kelley Lobean, Snitker’s campaign manager, said, “[Snitker] may not be for everybody, but do your duty 
as a voter, and look at everyone.”Senate hopeful

605 TOTAL VOTES26% YES74% NOFriday’s question: Are you glad women have the right to vote?Today’s question: Have you ever gone to Gator nights?There is a crook trying to get inside the governor’s man-
sion.
Unfortunately , many of the state’s Republicans 
want to give him the key . 
Tuesday, Rick Scott defeated Florida Attorney General Bill 
McCollum in Florida’s primary to earn a spot on November’s general election ballot. 
To be fair, not every Republican in the state voted for 
Scott — not even a majority. Scott won 46 percent of the votes against McCollum’s 43 percent. 
For those who don’t know, Scott is a millionaire business-
man who, in April, decided he wanted to buy something new: the governor’s office. And as of right now, he’s doing a pretty good job of it. 
One of Scott’s main rallying points was his self-financing 
of his own campaign. Scott refused to take any money from interest groups or outside organizations, making his victory 
his victory alone. 
But is it really a good thing for a corrupt health care CEO 
to be in office and responsible only to himself?
The funny thing is that his money has come from taxpay-
ers, or at least the ones his company scammed. Scott was CEO 
of Columbia/HCA, a for-profit health care provider. This is 
the same company that, while Scott was CEO, committed the 
largest case of Medicare and Medicaid fraud in history . 
The company would eventually settle with the govern-
ment for about $1.7 billion, and Scott was removed from his position as CEO by the board of directors.
Scott claimed he would run the state as a company and 
be the “CEO” of it as he has been successful in that position in the past. 
Does that mean our state is now going to be a corrupt 
company? Because that’s the only type of company Rick Scott knows how to lead and squander.
Scott also ran on a campaign of being a fresh face and not being a career politician like his oppo-nent McCollum. 
So instead of getting a career poli-
tician, we get a corrupt career busi-nessman. 
Sounds like a step in the wrong di-
rection to me. 
The truth is while he might be a ca-
reer politician, McCollum has done a darn good job of it.
While acting as attorney general, McCollum brought a 
lawsuit against Obama’s “Obamacare” along with other states’ attorneys general. This is, of course, the same health care bill the majority of Floridians were opposed to  in the 
first place. McCollum’s office also fought against child pred-
ators, trying to make Florida a safer place. 
Scott was able to flood the airwaves with ads, many of 
them spewing lies, with the backing of his seemingly bot-tomless wallet. 
He was able to tell lies about his opponent and about him-
self with the $50 million he has spent in his campaign so far. 
He has come very close to buying the governor’s office. What were Floridians thinking when 46 percent of Re-
publican voters thought this would actually be a good idea? 
Simply put, they weren’t. They believed his personal propaganda without bother -
ing to check if anything he was saying was even true. 
Scott is so far out that the Republican Governor’s Asso-
ciation didn’t even officially support him. In fact, they tried 
to do everything they could to make sure McCollum won.  
At the end of the day, the voters, and Scott’s money, spoke. 
And it looks like Scott is that much closer to pulling off his 
takeover of the governor’s mansion.

Better Late 
Than Never
Equality not a partisan 
issue
There are only a few, very rare events in this world that 
bring the Editorial Board so much joy at once.
A blind person miraculously regaining sight, an 
early sighting of Halley’s comet and flying swine are some of these events.
And when a former Republican National Committee chair -
man comes out from the closet, loud and proud, well, we can practically hear Alanis Morissette complaining she decided to sing and shout about that annoying-but-not-really-ironic black fly in her Chardonnay rather than this ironic gem.
Coming out to “The Atlantic” Wednesday, former Bush 
campaign chief and RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman, an-nounced it took him 43 years to finally become comfortable with “this part of his life.”
We applaud (loudly and obnoxiously) Mehlman’s better-
late-than-never acceptance of himself, but we can’t help but ask, “Really, Mehlman? You couldn’t have realized you were rather fond of men, you know, before your very own political party spearheaded the movement to support a Constitution-al amendment defining marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman?”
We’re just glad we’re not the guy who’s going to have to 
break the news to Mehlman that the political party he ran 
was responsible for crushing the gay rights movement and 
sending it to the equivalent of the Stone Age.
That’s going to be an awkward conversation! But we’re most disappointed in our society. We’re disap-
pointed the gay rights movement has, indeed, become a par -
tisan issue. 
And that very partisanship was never more evident than 
in Florida’s primary Tuesday.
Republican voters in the nation’s fourth-most-populous 
state were given an ultimatum between the GOP’s eventual gubernatorial nominee, Rick Scott, and the state’s attorney general, Bill McCollum, who has, on record, gone so far as to not only oppose adoption rights for gay couples but to also say gay Floridians should not be allowed to foster children. 
 Scott is a self-described supporter of “traditional mar -
riage,” whatever that is, if anything. He elaborates on his staunchly conservative beliefs on his campaign website that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. 
We’re disappointed the coming-out process of a Republi-
can Party official draws more scrutiny than one of a Demo-cratic Party leader. 
We look forward to the time when the knowledge that a 
former male Bush campaign chief likes boys and not girls will cause as much of a stir as fanny packs at Disney World. 
Former chairman Mehlman’s admission, even if at an 
older age and even after his political party attempted to for -
ever etch discrimination into one of our nation’s most sacred 
political documents, is proof that happiness, equality and in-
dividuality are, indeed, not partisan issues.  
We applaud Mehlman’s acceptance, and we hope not 
only the Republican Party but everyone — black, white, gay, straight — can follow suit and realize partisanship plays no role in equality. And we hope Floridians, especially, remem-ber that when casting their votes in November.   
Equality should be a unifying, bipartisan issue, drawing 
support from not some, but rather all members of Congress. 
Because when we replace “gay” with “women” or “black,” 
surely those movements for equality become a bipartisan is-sue. 
And that’s not equality. That’s exclusion.

Reader questions qualities 
of real leaders
Bryan Griffin’s column 
concerning Barack Obama is 
a wonderful example of the dishonest and unproductive state of political debate in this 
country. 
Griffin begins by question-
ing Obama’s motives prob-
ably because he, like his Re-publican and conservative comrades around the country, have forgotten what it looks like when someone makes tough decisions on tough is-
sues that involve reflection 
and sacrifice. 
For instance, let’s look at 
claims leveled against health care reform.
 Griffin notes, “The health 
care bill alone will raise bil-lions on the backs of the mid-dle class.”
 While in power, Repub-
licans ignored the fact that health care costs were grow-ing unsustainably and that this country spends a dispro-portionate amount of money on health care as compared to  the world’s other developed nations. 
Why? Because it’s easier to 
ignore tough problems. 
When Democrats took of-
fice, they decided to be real leaders and address this is-sue. 
Why? Because they want 
the federal government to take over your life? No. It’s because it needed to be done.  
If, indeed, reform begins 
with investment by all of us, then that’s the sacrifice we all must make. 
Add to this the fact that the 
Congressional Budget Office said health care reform would pay for itself. 
The type of leader Griffin 
envisions is the one who tells people what they want to hear now at the expense of the long term. 
It’s the type of leader who 
favors the short-term gains of turning New Yorkers against Muslims at the expense of this country’s long-term goals and values. 
It’s the type of leader who 
claims the Bush tax cuts affect people who make less than 
$250,000 a year at the expense 
of the truth. 
We face a choice in No-
vember. 
It’s a choice between those 
who trudge along in compli-cated times trying to find re-sponsible fixes to major prob-lems and those who promise 
to give us all cupcakes on 
Thursdays and $100 bills on Sundays. 
Do your homework. Read 
about the issues and ask your -
self what being a leader really means.

Rows of computers, game 
consoles and eager players filled 
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom Saturday as Gator Gaming host-ed GatorLAN. 
The event, which was held 
from 4 p.m. to midnight, was a computer and console gaming tournament open to the public.  
Registration for the free event 
was capped at 280 players, but those who didn’t register were welcome to come and play in the tournament. 
Randy Bush, a mechanical en-
gineering junior at UF, said the purpose of the event was to pro-mote Gator Gaming and unify UF and Gainesville gaming com-munities. He brought together companies like Electronic Arts and Best Buy to sponsor and host the tournaments at GatorLAN. 
“It’s basically when a bunch of 
geeks get together and play com-puter games,” Bush said. Eric Pena, a freshman history 
major, came out to the event and decided he wanted to join the club. Pena said he has been play-ing video games since he got his first Nintendo 64 when he was 6 years old.  
“I’ve been gaming like this in 
lieu of having a social life,” he said. 
Some of the games participants 
competed in included “Halo 
3,” “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2” and “Madden ‘11,” among others. For 
PC players, titles included “Star -
craft II,” “League of Legends”  and “Counter-Strike: Source.”
Gator Gaming President Kyle 
Kirwan said the idea for the club sprouted before he was a student at UF. 
Kirwan, an industrial and sys-
tems engineering junior, said he and his friends wanted to create an organization that would bring together individuals who are in-
terested in playing or competing 
in video game tournaments.Gamers compete

Traditional and contempo-
rary culture blended seamlessly 
at UF during the Asian Ameri-
can Student Union’s “Rolling Out the Red Carpet” assembly Friday night. 
Customary ribbon and fan 
dances were performed along-side hip-hop choreography and step routines on the stage of the Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts.
Other Asian-American stu-
dent groups were given a chance 
to perform for a 1,500-member audience, including the Chinese-
American Student Association, 
Filipino Student Association, Health Educated Asian Leaders, Korean Undergraduate Student 
Association, Vietnamese Stu-
dent Organization, alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority,  Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Pi Delta Psi Fraternity and Asian Kaleido-
scope Month.
Some of the groups chose to 
dance, while others performed 
skits, showed films or spoke about the organizations they 
represented.
This year’s assembly, which 
was organized by the Asian 
American Student Union, was 
the 17th anniversary of the 
event. It was also the largest in the assembly’s history, accord-ing to assembly co-director Dor -
othy Charles. 
The size of the event attract-
ed UF President Bernie Machen, who delivered opening remarks before Friday’s assembly.
“This show brings together 
a lot of Asian organizations, but 
it’s so much more than that,” 
said Jenn Nguyen, a 2010 UF graduate and former internal vice president of the Vietnamese Student Organization. 
“Look around. There are peo-
ple in the audience from every 
heritage and background. This 
showcase is for everyone, not just Asians.”
The assembly was designed 
with freshmen in mind, Charles 
said, and was meant to encour -
age students to become an ac-
tive part of the Asian-American community,
“I just want everyone to 
know how welcoming we are,” she said. 
Sophomore nuclear engineer -
ing major JaNaye Major said the 
assembly opened her eyes to the 
prominence of Asian student groups on campus. 
“I didn’t even know a lot of 
these organizations even ex-isted,” she said. “So it’s great to see how talented the students in them really are.”
Major sang along when the 
Vietnamese Student Organiza-tion performed a dance to “Dy-namite” by Taio Cruz. 
She said the best part of the 
event was the variety of organi-zations on one stage. 
“I came here to be blown 
away by culture,” she said.  “And I certainly was.”Asian student groups perform
About 1,500 attended
“This show brings togeth-
er a lot of Asian organiza -
tions, but it’s so much 
more than that. This 
showcase is for everyone, 
not just Asians.”

Sunday, including a career best 20 kills.
� MURPHY, BLEDSOE AND 
RIVERS NAMED TO ALL-TOUR -
NAMENT TEAM
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
Florida arrived  in Omaha, Neb., 
to open the season ranked the 13th 
best team in the country. 
The Gators (2-0) can expect their 
ranking to rise after battling to a 
seesaw 3-2 (25-22, 25-22, 29-31, 13-25, 15-12) victory over No. 2 Ne-
braska  (1-1) in the Runza/Ameri-
can Volleyball Coaches Association Showcase.
“I can’t tell you how proud I am 
of this group,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “The weaknesses we have we can make up for in how hard we will prepare and how hard we will play. Not many teams have come 
into this state and beaten the Husk-
ers.”
In front of 5,978 fans, the Gators 
found themselves against  a crowd 
heavily favoring Nebraska. During 
the match, “Go big red” could be heard throughout the arena.
“You can’t buy this experience,” 
Wise said. “They’re very volleyball 
knowledgeable. What they do so 
well is energize the Nebraska play-ers.”
After taking the first two sets, the 
Gators entered the third set with all the momentum. 
But after failing to win four 
match points in the third set, Ne-braska took the momentum and ran with it. 
The Cornhuskers won the tight 
third set and dominated the fourth frame. That momentum continued into the deciding set as Nebraska jumped out to a 3-0 lead.
It looked as though the script 
had been flipped on the Gators.
But as junior Kelly Murphy tied 
her career-high with 20 kills to go along with 23 assists and 10 digs 
for her 16th-career triple-double, 
the Gators battled back and put the finishing touches on a perfect week-end that started Saturday with a win over No. 9 Iowa State. 
“Kelly was nothing short of a 
first-team All-American today,” 
Wise said. “Everybody in the arena 
knew she was getting the ball and she still delivered. Kelly was fantas-tic but she had all the pieces around 
her playing their hearts out.”
Murphy was named to the AVCA 
Showcase All-Tournament Team 
along with seniors Lauren Bledsoe and Callie Rivers. 
Bledsoe recorded six kills and 
seven blocks Sunday as Rivers add-ed 12 kills, three service aces and seven digs.
Also performing big on Sunday 
was freshman Chanel Brown. She dished out a career-high 31 assists in her second appearance for Flor -
ida. 
Brown served five consecutive 
points in the fifth set to retake the lead from the Cornhuskers and put the Gators in a position to win.
“We felt like to beat Nebraska 
we would have to match the inten-sity level of not only the six players on the court, but also of the Husker fans,” Wise said. “This team really 
did a great job of that today.”

As the season creeps closer, 
questions are beginning to be an-
swered.
With injuries keeping left tack-
les Xavier Nixon (knee) and Matt 
Patchan (wrist) out of Florida’s 
season opener, offensive coordi-nator Steve Addazio revealed the team’s plans to fill those voids.
Senior Mike Pouncey said he 
was ready to move to right tackle if necessary, but UF decided to keep 
the Rimington Trophy hopeful at 
center.
The rest of the offensive line will 
feature seniors Marcus Gilbert (left 
tackle), Maurice Hurt (right tack-le) and Carl Johnson (left guard). Also, junior James Wilson will line up as the right guard.
With quarterback John Brantley 
starting his first game against Mi-
ami (Ohio), the offensive line will 
be looked upon to provide leader -
ship.
“I like the experience, and that’s 
where we are right now for a lot 
of reasons,” Addazio said. “It’s worked out great, we’re excited about it.”
Nixon and Patchan’s availabil-
ity for the second week of the sea-
son is unknown.
‘I don’t care’: Last year’s start-
ing middle linebacker, Brandon 
Spikes, stood at 6-foot-2, 243 pounds.
Those dimensions could shrink 
to 6-foot-1, 223 pounds this season if redshirt freshman Jelani Jenkins starts at the position.
Some are concerned with the 
18-year-old’s size, but Teryl Aus-
tin isn’t.
“I don’t care what they think,” 
he said. “I know what he does for 
us and I could care less what any-body else thinks.”
Instead, Austin believes Jen-
kins’ smaller frame could help 
him. When asked what sets Jenkins 
apart from UF’s other linebackers, 
Austin gave a quick response: “He 
runs like crazy.”
Keeping it in house: The Miami 
Herald reported freshmen Matt 
Elam and Solomon Patton were arrested for possession of alcohol under the age of 21 this summer.
Elam was found with a Four 
Loko and Patton had a drink that 
contained vodka, according to the 
Herald.
But coaches did not disclose 
the punishments the two players received.
“That’s something we handled internally,” Austin said.
Three Gators have been arrest-
ed for alcohol-related violations since June.
Elam and Patton are expected 
to be available when UF takes on Miami (Ohio) on Saturday.
Team captains:  With the loss 
of Tim Tebow, Maurkice Pouncey and Spikes, coaches have been 
looking for players to separate 
themselves as leaders.On Saturday, five players did 
that.
The team voted seniors Ahmad 
Black, Justin Trattou, Duke Lem-
mens, Mike Pouncey and A.J. Jones 
as the team captains.Sports monday

THE RALLY
TYLER: Which team has a better chance 
to reach the BCS National Champion-
ship Game, No. 1 Alabama or No. 3 Boise State? 
KYLE: I‘m not going to argue that Boi-
se State is the better team, but I think the Broncos have a better chance of reaching the national championship game than the Tide. Boise State usually starts much fur -
ther down in the polls and has to work its way up as the season progresses, but this year the Broncos are starting high enough to end up in one of the top two spots in the final BCS poll. Boise State plays No. 10 Vir -
ginia Tech and No. 24 Oregon State (who I think will win the Pac-10) in the first three weeks, which should give them enough cred if they run the table like last season. The WAC is prob-ably worse than it was a season ago, so I don’t see the Bron-cos losing to anyone in their conference. 
TYLER: No team 
outside the power conferences has had a better chance to reach the national championship than Boise State will this season. That said, the Broncos still face issues similar to the ones they did when finishing the year unbeaten in 2006 and 2009. Sure, starting the sea-son ranked in the top five gives them an edge. But will preseason hype help you if your strength of schedule is weak? With only two opponents in the preseason top 25, Boise State better hope Oregon State has a good season, and are we confident in the Beavers? 
The Broncos can 
go undefeated this year. But if two teams from bigger confer -
ences accomplish the same feat, Boise State will be left out in the cold once again. Alabama’s road is obviously much more difficult. But, in a round-about-way, that tough road actually gives them an edge compared to the Broncos. 
KYLE: The chances of two power-con-ference teams going undefeated isn’t very high. Since Aught-5, when an undefeated Texas and USC met in the title game, only three teams have entered the ‘ship unde-feated. And LSU even made the title game with two loses in 2007. Boise has enough juice this year to get the nod over a two-loss team, if they go undefeated. And may even have the juice to get the nod over a one-loss team from the Big East, ACC or Big Ten. And of course I’m confident in the Beavers, they’re DAMN good -- see what I did there? 
TYLER: I did see. And I’m not going to 
make a joke about turning the Tide on this argument.
Alabama obviously faces a steep chal-
‘Bama or Boise? Whose season has a better shot at ending in Glendale?

Vote online at alligatorSports.orgBy JAIME MANHEIMER 
Alligator Writer
The Gators ended the first half of 
Sunday disappointed, as they failed to 
finish some prime scoring opportuni-ties and recorded only five shots.
But Florida came out of the locker 
room strong and focused as forward McKenzie Barney scored the lone goal of the game in the first 40 seconds of the second half on a beautiful through ball from Erika Tymrak, leading UF 
(4-0, 0-0) to a 1-0 victory over San Di-
ego State. Barney has now scored in six consecutive home games.  
“The first half was not accept-
able, and coach made that perfectly clear at halftime,” Barney said. “Erika (Tymrak) did a great job of commit-ting defenders, and she was dribbling through the middle and attracted the 
defender who was marking me and 
that gave me an opportunity to make a run. She gave me a fantastic ball and I put it in.
“Although, I should have put two 
more in the back of the net.”
The Gators’ offensive attack con-
sisted of short, quick passes in the middle of the field, which soon wore 
down the Aztecs’ defense and allowed 
the Gators more shots, a stat that tri-pled in the second half. 
The Aztecs played an offsides trap 
with three defenders as they tried to gain control of the midfield. But San Diego State’s switch from a 4-4-2 to a 
3-5-2 was detrimental, 
as UF overwhelmed the Aztecs’ back 
three with attackers.
“We weren’t happy with our per -
formance at halftime,” UF coach Becky Burleigh said. “We have a high expec-tation when we perform, and that’s a positive, but we are still working our way to get better each game.”
The Gators’ defense, however, 
looked incoherent at times, allow-ing San Diego State a couple of good chances.
“With the defense, we just need 
to pay attention to detail,” Burleigh said. “I was very disappointed in our lack of execution. That game was like work, and our games before have 
been much more free flowing and we 
need to be prepared ... we need to do the simple things right, and we took too much for granted.”
The Gators play their only home 
game of September next Friday when they host Jacksonville.16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 30, 2010
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF forward McKenzie Barney scored the only Gators goal Sunday. It 
came within the first 40 seconds of the second half.
lenge this season. The team lost eight starters on 
defense, plays in the toughest division in the nation and has a target on its back all season. But the of-fense returns eight starters, including Heisman Tro-
phy winner Mark Ingram. And he might be only the 
team’s third best offensive weapon. Freak of nature Julio Jones could dominate any defensive backfield 
if healthy, and backup running back Trent Richard-
son should see an expanded role after torching Tex-
as in the national championship game last season.  
Of course, this isn’t a debate about talent, because 
Alabama would blow Boise State out athletically. 
But, because of that level of talent, the Crimson Tide 
is used to high expectations. Alabama was viewed as 
a national championship contender from the outset 
of 2009, beginning the year ranked fifth. Even though Boise State started at No. 14 in that same preseason 
poll, the Broncos were not in the title conversation 
until the end of the year.
KYLE: Boise St. is just as loaded on offense as 
Alabama, as they return every starter on that side 
of ball, including Heisman hopeful Kellen Moore at 
quarterback, top receivers Titus Young and Austin 
Pettis, and backfield speedster Jeremy Avery. In fact, 
I’m willing to bet Boise State has the highest scoring offense in the nation this season. ‘Bama needed their 
defense to bail them out of some tough jams last 
year (see:Tennessee) when quarterback Greg McEl-
roy struggled and the running game wasn’t on point. 
Rolando McClain and Terrence Cody aren’t walking through those doors, Tyler. (Hopefully, Cody isn’t 
running through those doors either. Mount Cody’s 
got more jiggle than Jell-O.) On defense, they return 
all but one starter (first-round NFL Draft pick Kyle 
Wilson), so they should be able to hold opponents under the 45 points per game their offense will be 
putting up. Neither of the Broncos’ early season 
tests come on the road. They take on VT at a neu-
tral site. And as good as those Beavers are, you don’t just walk into Boise and leave the smurf turf with a win. In the end, there’s room for both of them. And 
I wouldn’t be shocked to see a Boise State-Alabama 
matchup.RALLY , from page 15Gators control second half in win
