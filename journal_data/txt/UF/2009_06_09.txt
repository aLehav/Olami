The adoption fee for kittens at the shelter has been reduced to $33.

Residents of the Tent City home-
less community have been served 
eviction notices following a stab-
bing last week, but no housing al-ternatives have been offered for the mini-city’s nearly 200 inhabitants.The eviction will be enforced 
starting 9 a.m. on Thursday.
There are more than 1,600 home-
less people in Gainesville, with 300 
beds available on any given night 
in shelters, many of them already filled by women and children.
Amanda Gunn, a local Faces 
of Homelessness spokeswoman, points out several realities about the eviction. 
“There’s no giant YMCA to let 
them camp out and 
no storage units for 
their stuff, which breaks my heart to be 
honest,” she said.
She talked about a Tent City man who built a house with insu-lation, a kitchen and a bedroom all from scraps he found at a construc-tion site. 
But the self-proclaimed mayor of 
Tent City can’t take his home with him, just as many residents can’t carry everything that they own on 
their backs. “There are a lot of personal items 
they are just expected to walk away 
from,” Gunn said.
In addition to the possible loss 
of possessions, some Tent City resi-dents have recently lost pets to a different threat.

Alachua County Animal Ser-
vices has reduced its feline fees in response to the over-crowding of cats.
In honor of Adopt-A-Cat 
Month, the shelter has cut the usual cat adoption fee of $67 to $33 for the month of June.
The shelter has placed all of its 
cats and kittens on the New Hope 
program, which normally lowers 
the cost for sick or older cats who have not been adopted, said Dr. Julie Levy, director of Maddie’s 
Shelter Medicine Program at UF.
According to the shelter’s Web 
site, the $33 includes vaccines, 
spaying or neutering, a microchip and de-worming of the cats.
David Flagler, director of Ala-chua County Animal Services 
said this year’s over-crowding of 
cats is not only due to the annual kitten season but also because of the poor economy.
He said the majority of the 
pets at the shelter are brought in by owners who can no longer af-ford to keep them.
To ensure survival, kittens at 
the shelter must be transferred to approved rescue groups.
Some kittens and cats who 
are not transferred or adopted are euthanized to make room for new litters.
Because of the limited space, 
nursing mother cats and their kit-tens have to leave after only a few 
days.

shelter over-crowding, the Ala-Shelter reduces

Beginning next month, the burden of 
education loans will be partially lifted for 
some students.
As of July 1, the interest rates on subsi-
dized Stafford loans will dip from 6.0 per-cent to 5.6 percent as part of a new debt-reduction plan.
The reduction is part of a four-year plan 
to incrementally reduce interest rates each year until 2011, when rates are expected to drop as low as 3.4 percent, said Rick Wild-er, associate director of Student Financial Affairs at UF.
“There are a number of undergraduate 
students who will benefit from the
interest rate reduction,” Wilder said. 
“Anytime interest rates go down, the amount a student has to repay will be less.”
The Obama Administration has imple-
mented this reduction, under the College Cost Reduction and Access Law, to encour-age students to stay in school longer by making it more affordable and to wait to enter the job market until the economy is 
more stable.
“The reduced inter-
est rates are a good way to increase the demand for education, a good use of government resources 
during the recession be-cause the more people are in school, the fewer there are jostling with each oth-
er to get the limited number of entry-level jobs,” said David Denslow, economic ana-lyst and macroeconomics professor at UF.
For many UF students, the rate reduc-
tions will be a huge weight off their shoul-ders.
“Knowing I can now pay back less than 
I had originally expected is awesome and knowing the rates are continuing to drop is even better,” said Claire Meharg, a 19-year-old UF junior who took out a subsidized Stafford loan before coming to UF.
But the relief doesn’t come without neg-

DELTONA, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say three people are un-
der arrest for carjacking a van that had a 3-year-old boy inside.
The suspects put the boy out of the van in Deltona Monday 
before taking off with the vehicle, which belonged to the boy's 
father. The father told investigators that he sold shoes and had met with the suspects for business. When he went to the back of his van to fetch some shoes, one of the suspects put a gun to his head and demanded his wallet and keys.
Volusia County deputies spotted the suspects about two 
miles from the carjacking scene. The suspects ditched the van and were captured after a foot chase.Van carjacked with boy inside � The UF baseball

Police rule out man assuspect in murder case
MIAMI (AP) — Authorities say 
the man they were looking for in 
connection with the murder of a 
21-year-old whose dismembered 
body was found in plastic bags floating in Biscayne Bay has been 
ruled out as a suspect.
Miami police on Monday said 
they located the man who goes by

she said.
This past year, speakers in-

Henderson also said she 
wants to host a speakers series about Florida’s water issues.
“Water is our most important 
resource in Florida,” she said. 
“We have enough of it, we just don’t have it distributed where 
we want it and need it.”

HILLSBORO, Ore. (AP) — A woman 
accused of killing her pregnant friend is 
believed to have cut open the 21-year-old’s abdomen to take her baby and pass it off as her own, investigators said Mon-
day.
The infant also died, but it could not be 
determined whether he was alive when 
he was taken from Heather Snively’s womb, the Washington County sheriff’s department said in a statement.
A 27-year-old wom-
an, Korena Roberts, has been charged with 
murder in Snively’s 
death. She appeared in court Monday but did not enter a plea.
A 911 call on Friday 
brought emergency workers to Roberts’ 
house in the Portland suburb of Beaver-ton. Workers found blood on the floor 
and Roberts’ boyfriend trying to revive 
the infant.
Investigators said Roberts claimed the 
baby was hers. At the emergency room, doctors, who were unable to revive the baby, determined that Roberts had not given birth.
Police said they returned to Roberts’ 
home and found Snively’s body in a 
crawl space. Roberts’ boyfriend is coop-
erating and doesn’t face charges, the sher-iff’s office said.TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 3

David Guzick becomes UF’s senior vice president of 
health affairs and president of the UF&Shands Health System on July 1. Guzick is the dean of the University of Rochester’s School of Medicine and Dentistry.
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF has named a new senior 
vice president for health affairs 
and president for the UF&Shands Health System. 
Beginning July 1, Dr. David 
Guzick, the dean of the School of Medicine and Dentistry at the Uni-versity of Rochester in New York, will replace Dr. Douglas Barrett to run the world-renowned hospi-tal’s health care system and UF’s Health Science Center.
Guzick said his first priority 
will be patient care, but “every-
thing else follows,” referring to 
the Health Science Colleges and Shands impact on patient care. 
“It’s very exciting,” Guzick, 57, 
said. “My job is to try to individu-alize areas of concern and stimu-late people to come together who wouldn’t have before.” 
Barrett, who will step down 
from the position after seven years to return to clinical practice as a pediatric immunologist, said one 
of Guzick’s biggest challenges will 
be recruiting the next dean for the College of Medicine, as well as for the College of Public Health and Health Professions.   
Guzick will also have to man-
age the health science center and health affairs “through tough eco-nomic times,” Barrett added. 
Guzick, a reproductive endocri-
nologist, is an internationally rec-ognized expert in women’s health 
and epidemiology and operates 
the College of Medicine and Den-tistry in Rochester under a larger budget and larger hospital than he will at UF’s Health Science Center and UF&Shands. 
“I think one of my strengths is 
that I don’t have an agenda,” Guz-ick said, referring to the fact that he 
wants to look for the best possible 
option. “As dean, I have bent over backwards to support different ar-eas (in the College of Medicine and Dentistry).” 
Guzick began as dean in Roch-
ester under a similar situation UF is in now, when the University of Rochester had a separate academic 
and hospital facilities, he said. 
“It was the next step in a logical 
progression,” Guzick said. “Com-
ing to Florida presented the same type of opportunity that I took part of in Rochester.”
Guzick earned his graduate de-
gree in economics and mathemat-ics at New York University. He 
also received his medical degree 
and a Ph.D in economics at NYU. 
Before completing a fellowship 
in reproductive endocrinology at the University of Texas South-western Medical School in Dallas, he completed his residency in ob-stetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins.
“You can’t think of another 
hospital (Shands) that has reached so far,” he said.UF AdMINIS trAtIoNUF names new VP for heath affairs Baby stolen

Some local iPhone users are peeved by the $200 fee 
required for an upgrade to Apple’s newest product, the 
iPhone 3GS.
The new phone, which was announced Monday, 
will be twice as fast as the previous iPhone 3G and runs 
the company’s new 3.0 operating system. According to an Apple press release, the iPhone 3G has “the world’s most advanced mobile operating system.”
New AT&T customers can purchase a 16 gigabyte 
iPhone 3GS for $199 or the 32 gigabyte model for $299 when they sign a two-year contract.
While some Apple fans welcome the news, others 
are questioning the $200 premium charge by AT&T to upgrade from its previous version of the iPhone.
“I didn’t feel that the features of the 3GS were worthy 
of that upgrade fee,” said Trevor Gribble, a second-year UF MBA student. “It seems very unreasonable to me.”
In previous iPhone releases there were no fees for 
upgrading Apple’s mobile phone to the newest model.
“It doesn’t seem fair to the current users,” Gribble 
said. “New users get to have the same iPhone for less money.”
The premium fees are due to subsidies paid by 
AT&T from the 2008 release of the iPhone 3G by signing a two-year contract with the cell phone’s only carrier, which the company refuses to pay twice within a one-year period, according to AppleInsider.com.
When the last iPhone update was released less than 
a year ago, AT&T paid Apple for customers to upgrade 
to the new 3G. But AT&T refuses to subsidize a second 
upgrade in less than a year, making customers pay out of pocket if they want the new phone.
Current iPhone 3G owners can purchase the 16 GB 
model for $399 and the 32 GB model for $499 or wait until their contract allows for an early upgrade.
Mobile phone users who do not yet own an iPhone 
have the option of buying the older iPhone 3G for $99.
Gribble opted to buy the 3G model instead of the 
more expensive 3GS model.
“I’m happy that I don’t have to worry about [the $200 
fee],” Gribble said. “I can see peoples frustrations.”
Other people are not concerned with the changes. Greg Jones, an introductory meditation instructor at 
Gainesville Karma Thegsum Choling, said despite cre-ating a meditation application for the older version, he did not have to reformat it for the iPhone 3GS. In the bSerine application, iPhone users learn introductory 
meditation from the center’s teacher David Bole.
Jones said that because he and his son, Ben, created 
an application for the iPhone, they found out about Ap-
ple’s new operating system version in April.
As a project manager, Ben, 23, has created numerous 
iPhone applications including an application that links firefighters’ iPhones to their main database. 
Those who already have the application will receive 
upgrades for free.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2009

A Gainesville man was arrested 
and charged with sexually assault-
ing a woman at gunpoint Friday.
The victim told officials that Ro-
berto Allende, 27, said he would 
drive her to Northeast Gainesville, 
according to an Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office report.
While driving, Allende told 
the woman he had to stop at his apartment to pick something up. When they arrived at 2227 SW 
73rd Terrace, Al-
lende asked the 
woman to come 
inside with him, 
according to the 
report.
The woman 
told officials that Allende snorted 
cocaine while in 
his apartment, and she got upset 
and told him to take her home. In-
stead, he went into the bathroom 
and came out carrying a silver handgun.
According to the woman, Al-
lende pinned her  against a wall, covered her mouth with his hand, 
pointed the gun at her head and 
forced her to give him oral sex.  
Afterwords, Allende forced her to 
have sexual intercourse, the report 
stated.
The woman then asked Allende 
to get her water. When he left the 
room,  she threw his gun under the 
bed and ran to a nearby store.
When confronted by authorities, 
Allende said he had no weapons in the house and picked up the victim 
only to buy cocaine for her. Man jailed,

with rape

Scholars from around the world are 
gathered again at UF for a six-week 
program to study U.S. foreign policy.
The conference, which kicked off 
Monday, converges 18 scholars rep-
resenting countries such as Nigeria, 
Mongolia, Cameroon and Kazakhstan. It will be taught by more than 30 ex-perts during a four-week study at UF and will tour Miami, Chicago and Washington for the remaining two weeks.
U.S. State Department granted UF’s 
Department of Political Science nearly 
$290,000, about $40,000 more than last 
year, to host the Study of the United States Institute on U.S. Foreign Policy for a second time.
The exchange program is one of 
eight programs offered by Study of the United States Institutes (SUSI) and is managed by U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and 
Cultural Affairs, according to the U.S. 
Department of State Web site. 
UF is also hosting for the third time 
a SUSI program on Journalism and Media later in the summer.
“Fortunately these grants are pro-
tected by government,” said Aida Hozic, a co-director of the program 
and UF political science professor.
Pawel Frankowski, a polish par-ticipant in last year’s conference, said these types of programs are especially 
important for scholars from less-devel-oped countries. 
After being in U.S. for six weeks, 
the scholars can prove, show and ex-plain the real image of America when they go back home, he said.
“It’s a unique opportunity to see 
what the American academia looks 
like and how different is the style of 
teaching,” he said in an e-mail. ”For some scholars it’s (their) very first time (connecting) with practitioners.”
Ido Oren, a co-director for the 
program, said the additional funds will help draw more guest speakers 
from universities outside UF, such as 
Massachusetts Institute of Technol-ogy, University of Georgia and George Washington University.
This year’s theme is “Domestic 
Sources of U.S. Foreign Policy: Beyond the Beltway, Behind CNN.”
According to Oren, Florida is a good 
location for studying foreign policy.
Studying the U.S. and Cuban rela-
tions without knowing anything about the Cuban community of Florida, for 
example, would be very hard, he said.
Hozic said the program also pro-
vides great opportunities for meeting 
people from different countries. She said last year’s participants enjoyed spending time together and learning from each other.
“It’s really amazing to see the hu-
man network that comes out of it,” 
she said. “We’ve received notes from 
past participants with sayings such as ‘I wish I was there’ and ‘I’m so nostal-gic.’”
It’s also an opportunity to be young 
again in the sense of exploration, he said.
Maria Tzankova, a Bulgarian par-
ticipant in last year’s conference, said 
her experience at SUSI was positive, 
but her stay caused her to be con-cerned with the way natural resourc-es, especially fuel, are used in U.S.   
She said she has noticed that only stu-
dents use the public transportation in Gainesville, the fast food restaurants on campus use too much paper and plastic packaging and the air condi-
tioners in UF’s halls and rooms blast 
cold air excessively.
Frankowski said one of his most 
precious memories of last year’s con-ference is the Fourth of July celebration at state Sen. Steve Oelrich’s residence when people were throwing fireworks around the lake.ON CAMPUSUF hosts foreign policy program
UF may be hard to get into, but new data shows it is 
easy to get out of. 
UF boasts an 81 percent graduation rate since 2001, 
the highest in the state for a public school, according to recent data from the federal education department. 
Florida State University had the second highest 
graduation rate with 69 percent, according to the data.
Of the 11 public universities in Florida, four graduate 
the majority of their students within six years.  
UF’s high graduation rate can be 
partially attributed to the Universal Tracking System, which monitors 
degree progress through audits and advising, accord-
ing to UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
During the year that the system was implemented, 
the graduation rates of fourth- or fifth-year students 
rose by 4 percent as compared to the previous year, ac-cording to reports from UF’s Office of Institutional Plan-ning and Research.
Apart from the UTS, Steve Orlando attributed UF’s 
high graduation rate to the quality of UF’s students. 
“Typically when you get a higher-level student, you 
are more likely to get a student who is motivated to graduate on time,” said Orlando.

Critics of Obama’s speech miss point
Today’s question: Should Tent City 
be closed for good?
222 TOTAL VOTES23% YES77% NOThursday’s question: Do you          consider yourself politically ignorant?From Bob Hope to Drew 
Carey, comedians have long graced America’s 
troops with their presence to provide a brief respite from the banality of war. 
The latest funny man to 
elicit a chuckle or two? None other than Comedy Central’s Stephen Colbert.
While filming four epi-
sodes of his no-laugh-track-
necessary hit show “The 
Colbert Report” in Iraq, the former presidential candi-date pulled out all the stops  
overseas. Known for his in-
credible fashion sense while shooting in the States, Col-bert still managed to stay fresh by rocking a suit — a 
dapper double-breasted do-
up constructed entirely out of camouflage. Not only did Colbert blend in well with 
his outfit, he even traded in 
his more conservative hair-cut for one more akin to his audience.
During an interview 
with Gen. Ray Odierno, a mountain of a man standing 6 feet 5 inches tall, a video cut the conversation shot as 
President Barack Obama in-
structed Odierno to “cut that man’s hair.” Not one to dis-obey the orders of his com-mander-in-chief, the general 
quickly donned an electric 
razor to leave Colbert with a hairstyle that can only be de-scribe as high and tight. Even 
Sen. John McCain got in on 
the action as he recorded a video of his own — encour-aging troops to “take time to clean your muskets.”
All tired gun jokes aside, 
Colbert’s efforts in Iraq speak of a man truly humbled by the opportunity to share his 
craft with the ever-deserving 
American troops.For two American journalists jailed in North Korea, the simple act of illegally entering the country may cost them more than a decade of their freedom.
Word out of Asia reveals Laura Ling and Euna Lee, 
employees of California media venture Current TV, were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor on Monday after be-ing arrested in March. According to an article on CNN.com, 
the United States, through the works of Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, remains busy maneuvering the release of the two women through diplomatic means. In a letter to a North Korean official, Clinton made mention of important personal details about each woman — revealing Ling’s poor 
medical history and the fact Lee has a young daughter.
Beyond Clinton, proposed efforts include sending an ac-
complished diplomat such as New Mexico Gov. Bill Rich-
ardson or former Vice President Al Gore to remedy the situ-

Fortunately for the women, North Korean custom calls 
for a trial to take place before responding to any pleas made 
by a foreign country. Now that the trial is over, North Korea may be more willing to deal with the United States and ar-
range a deal to release Ling and Lee.
What could help make the negotiations run smoothly is 
the fact that the two countries have agreed to keep the mat-
ter of the two journalists separate from any nuclear power-
related squabbles.
While the ordeal has been arduous for both Ling and Lee, 
optimism remains high that the United States’ diplomatic 
efforts will win over a nation riddled by archaic ideology.
As President Barack Obama took the stage in Cairo, Egypt, on Thursday, millions of people tuned in to watch him give his highly anticipated speech 
to the Muslim world.
Obama’s speech to the Muslim people was certainly 
not groundbreaking in its content, but the tone was dif-ferent from that of our previous administration. Gone, 
it seems, are the days of either being with us or with the 
evildoers. Instead of chastising, Obama spoke with a sense of respect and understanding toward the people who haven’t been heard in years.
From greeting his audience in Arabic and quoting the 
Quran to using carefully chosen words that would trans-late well, Obama maintained a middle ground, which was extremely important given his situation and audi-ence.
Many have criticized the speech, saying that it wasn’t 
a harsh enough stance against the leaders of Muslim na-tions — but they’ve missed the point entirely. The speech was not aimed at heads of state, but at a younger genera-tion of Muslim people, which is where the ties between 
America and the Muslim world lie. By speaking to these 
future leaders, this new rhetoric will hopefully dissuade potential Islamic militants from choosing to go down the path of extremism.
In about 55 minutes, the president managed to take 
the case away from extremists that aggression is the only choice.
Even before Obama started his trip to the Middle East, 
al-Qaeda’s head honcho himself, Osama bin Laden, felt 
compelled to release an audio statement condemning 
the American president. It seems that the bearded hide-and-seek champion of the world is worried about the message Obama carries with him — that the West is not at war with Muslims and that violence isn’t go-
ing to solve anything.
And although his speech in Cai-
ro won’t change things immediate-
ly, it is important that Obama said 
what he did, putting to words what 
many have thought but dared not 
speak — bringing up taboos including women’s rights and religious freedom.
Critics have blasted Obama for not painting the full 
picture of the Middle East and not talking enough about Iran’s nuclear program or the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. People have talked for years and years and not been able to expand on all of the problems, so why did so many 
seem to expect him to singlehandedly spell out each and 
every thing wrong with the region?
It’s been almost painful to watch his critics grasping 
at straws trying to find fault in what was undeniably an important speech.
Interestingly enough, most of this criticism is coming 
from pundits back home, while the majority of critics in the Middle East express reactions ranging from skepti-cism to hope. In a region where talking hasn’t done much 
in the past, it’s hard to see what sort of change could 
come of it, but perhaps people want to believe things are going to get better at this point. Only time will tell if these strong words will be followed by actions.
In the end, no shoes came flying toward the stage, so 
even if nothing else comes of the speech, at least we can say that in itself is an accomplishment.

Well, I thought I had it in me, but I 
don’t. 
Sonia Sotomayor has been Pres-
ident Barack Obama’s official Supreme Court nominee for only the briefest time, and I’m already sick of hearing about her. Yet, as the song goes, we’ve only just begun.
Sotomayor’s resume has little for me to be 
interested in, unfortunately. Her rulings are thin in the areas of reproductive rights and sexual equality. From what I understand, one of her primary achievements was when she 
managed to resolve a strike involving Major 
League Baseball. Frankly, though, I couldn’t care less about what one of the members of our highest court has done this week in the 
world of baseball. I have a friend or two who 
can at least take an interest in how her actions might affect their fantasy baseball teams, but the closest I can get to being interested is this sad degree of separation.
As murky as her feelings on reproductive 
rights are, though, there’s one case that she has ruled on — and in a manner that some might find surprising for Obama’s nominee. 
In Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. 
Bush, Sotomayor voted to uphold the “Mex-ico City Policy,” also known as the “Global Gag Rule,” wherein the U.S. Government can deny medical aid to countries that advertise 
or even mention abortion. Her ruling was 
based on her assertion that “the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with 
public funds.” 
This ruling has ignited a small firestorm 
among die-hard liberals, especially those 
who applauded when Obama repealed that policy upon taking office. 
This firestorm, I believe, is unwarranted. 
Despite my disagreement with the ruling, I see no evidence in it that Sotomayor per-formed Scalian legal gymnastics or that she is 
particularly anti-abortion. Her ruling seems 
more about federal power than anything else. 
It is also noteworthy that she chose the terms “pro-choice” rather than “pro-abor-tion” and “anti-abor-
tion” rather than “pro-
life.” In this neutrality of terms, I find nothing to be concerned about. 
The bottom line is that 
her position on repro-
ductive rights is not clear enough to warrant either praise or derision from either side.
However, there is another storm looming 
on the Sotomayor front, and it is growing more insistent. Such conservative luminaries as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity have been attempting to cynically paint her as a 
racist. Seems counterintuitive? Fear not! They 
enter into evidence this quote from a lecture she gave at Berkeley several years ago: “I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more 
often than not reach a better conclusion than 
a white male who hasn’t lived that life.” 
Now, there is no doubt that this statement 
was foolish. There is further no doubt that it 
is egotistical. But it is not racist. Sotomayor 
was trying to express the role she thinks life experience — and that “empathy” that Obama spoke of — plays in the making of a good judge. Personally, I disagree with her 
statement, but to color it as racist when, re-
ally, it was just ill-advised is an exercise in hysterics.
Sotomayor’s confirmation should go 
through without much difficulty. I can’t imagine that there will be a sufficient rally to bork her, and so we now know our next Supreme Court justice. Only we don’t really know her at all. While that gives us nothing 
to cheer about, it further gives us nothing to 
cry over either. 
At 54 years old, Sotomayor probably has 
decades left, so I suggest that those on both 
sides of the ideological divide get used to 
her.

letters@alligator.orgPresident Barack Obama fulfilled 
another campaign promise last week after visiting Cairo, Egypt, 
and beginning a public dialogue with the Arabic world about the peace pro-cess. The president’s speech in front of the Cairo University audience ran nearly an hour and evoked applause, shouts of adoration and a few awk-ward silences.
The long silences came when 
Obama argued for the right to Israel’s peaceful existence. The applause came when Obama mentioned the Arab world’s contribution to mankind. The shouts of adoration came when Obama recognized the state of Palestine was living in conditions “that come with occupation.”
That last part is what’s key. The 
president of the United States actually went to the heart of the Muslim world and spoke of the need for Israeli com-promise when dealing with Palestine. 
He actually said, “The United States 
does not accept the legitimacy of con-
tinued Israeli settlements. This con-struction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve 
peace.”
It was a tricky speech for the presi-
dent and his young speechwriter, Jon 
Favreau, to write. 
Not only did they have to let the 
Arab world know the U.S. isn’t bent on destroying its slice of civilization, but Israelis and Israeli symphasiz-ers couldn’t be left to think this new American administration was leaving them out in the cold.
America and our buddy relation-
ship with Israel has often served as a rallying call for Islamic extremists in the region. 
When a radical cleric condemns 
the “Zionist state,” the chant “death to America” usually follows close be-hind.
While many in the region believe 
America will always side with Israel, that has not always been the case. Just last year, Pres-ident Bush declared that peace in the region was never pos-sible if Israel didn’t coop-erate more. 
Still, every time we appear to look the other way in many of Israel’s military reactions while offering condemnation whenever a Palestinian fires a mortar rocket, we only serve as bumps in the road to peace, fueling both anti-Amer-ican and anti-Israeli sentiments among radical and even amicable Arabs pas-sionate about the Israel-Palestine con-flict.
Israel has a right to exist. Its people 
have a right to a peaceful existence. But a peaceful Israel will never exist with-out a peaceful Palestine. Peace can only come through Israel’s recognition of a 
full-fledged Palestinian state. These 
basic statements are well-known and 
mostly agreed upon by experts in the region but are foreign to most Ameri-cans.
These were all points that Obama 
raised in Cairo. They are issues that many people in the audience and in Israel agree upon. The real trick, now, will be for the president to get national public opinion behind him when deal-ing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and convince the “folks” and “average Joes” that Palestinians have a right to a state just as much as Israelis do. 
Once the Obama administration 
has the weight of a more informed electorate willing to accept a lose-lose agreement, rather than an Israeli-win, Palestinian-lose agreement, will the region finally secure the ultimate goal of peace.
Maybe, Cairo, Egypt, wasn’t the 
best place to deliver the speech. Obama should have gone to Cairo, Ill.

Statewide chatter surround-
ing the February Florida Bar Ex-
amination could send prospec-tive law students south.
Exam results revealed a UF 
passing rate of only 64.9 percent, the lowest in school history, ac-
cording to Fredric G. Levin Col-
lege of Law dean Robert Jerry. 
FIU celebrated a passing rate 
of 81.5 percent.
According to U.S. News and 
World Report, UF’s law school 
ranks 51st in the nation, ranks 
first in the state and has a grad-uation rate nearing 99 percent.  
The reason for the poor Bar 
passage is simple, Jerry said in response to those reveling in 
their statistical stride past UF. 
Three years ago, the college 
began to accept only one enter-ing class per year, eliminating the spring class and leaving the 
students less time to prepare for the exam.  
As a result, the three-year 
program had only a handful of students complete their stud-
ies in time to take the February 
exam, Jerry said.  
“I can say with confidence 
that for any school to make as-sertions of quality based on 16 students taking a bar exam is 
misleading,” he said.  
Florida State University 
received a similar 65 percent passing rate, with 26 of 40 grad-
uates passing.  The University of 
Miami had 22 of 36 graduates 
pass, a 61.1 percent success rate, 
according to the Florida Board of Bar Examiners. 
“It’s the law of large num-
bers, and it’s the perversity of using small numbers,” he said, 
citing high passing rates in re-
cent years. In February 2008, 158 of 179 
students passed for a rate of 88.3 percent, 14.5 percent above 
the state average, Jerry said. 
On last July’s exam, 89.4 per-
cent of testers passed, placing 
UF 7.6 percent above the state average.  
“Year in and year out, UF has 
the most consistently high pass-ing rate in the state of Florida,” 
he said.
Jerry said in the future, 
struggling students will be en-couraged to complete addition-
al studies and preparation prior to taking the Florida Bar Exam.  
The Florida Bar Examination 
is a two-part assessment, con-
sisting of a General Bar Exami-
nation, specific to Florida state laws, as well as the Multistate 
Bar Examination and Multistate 
Professional Responsibility Ex-amination section. 
Eighty percent of UF gradu-
ates passed the multistate por-tion of the exam in February.  
There is no way to determine 
group performance on particu-lar areas of subject matter within 
the General Bar Examination. 
UF law is confident that the 
February results will not dam-age the school’s reputation, 
Jerry said.  
“We’re always trying to en-
roll the best that we can and have the highest student quality that we can,” he said. “Students 
are proud to have graduated 
from this school.”THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The families of 
two American journalists convicted of cross-
ing into North Korean territory pleaded to that country’s government to let them go.
The families of Laura Ling, 32, and Euna 
Lee, 36, said in a statement Monday that Ling has a “serious medical condition” that will be worsened by her prison sentence. The state-ment also says Lee has a 4-year-old daughter who is beginning to worry about her mother.
Laura Ling is the younger sister of Lisa 
Ling, a reporter for National Geographic “Ex-plorer” TV. Lisa said her sister suffers from an ulcer that requires medical treatment.
The women were working for San Fran-
cisco-based Current TV when North Korean guards seized them March 17 near the coun-try’s border with China. The nation’s highest court sentenced them over the weekend to 12 years of hard labor.
The families were “shocked and devas-
tated” by the sentence, according to the state-ment, which was issued through the families’ 
New York-based spokeswoman, Alanna 
Zahn. They asked the North Korean govern-ment “to show compassion” and grant the women clemency.
“We believe that the three months they 
have already spent under arrest with little communi-cation with their families is long enough,” the families said.
The statement also al-
luded to the diplomatic 
sensitivities of their arrest and subsequent trial, which 
came at a time of height-
ened tension between the U.S. and North Ko-
rea over that country’s nuclear program.Ling and Lee were reporting about the 
trafficking of women at the time of their ar-
rest.
“We don’t know what really happened 
on March 17, but if they wandered across the 
border without permission, we apologize on their behalf and we are certain that they have also apologized,” the statement said.
Roxana Saberi, a journalist released after 
four months in prison in Iran, said in a state-ment issued by the Committee to Protect 
Journalists that she was “shocked and sad-
dened to hear about the heavy sentence” im-posed on the women.
Families appeal for clemency for two held in Korea
ative effects, Denslow said.
“The chief problem is that 
while the low rates increase the 
demand for higher education, they don’t do as much to in-crease the supply,” he said. 
Student loans are an invest-
ment that benefits both the stu-dents and the government, he 
said.
According to Denslow, the 
country needs the investment 
during the reces-
sion so that the current generation of college students 
will be able to support the baby boomers on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
The current generation is go-
ing to have to be highly produc-tive for that these benefits to be possible, Denslow said.
Due to the recession, state 
funded universities as well as community colleges have had to cut back on enrollment. While the lower rates make col-lege more affordable, they also make college more competitive because more people are com-peting for fewer spots, Denslow said.
“Lowering the amount I have 
to repay after graduation is a relief, but the insecurities we all have about our unstable econo-my still stand,” Meharg said. 
The new plan also includes 
an increase in funds available for students who qualify for the Pell Grant Scholarship.
The maximum Pell Grant 
Scholarship for the 2009-2010 school year will be $5,350, more than $600 above last year’s award. 
Increases in student awards 
are due to the funding boosts provided by the College Cost Reduction Act.
About 6 million students re-
ceive the Pell grant each year.Low rate to

StudentLiferipped apart by a 6-foot alligator on Monday 
morning, which has taken up residence in a stream running through Tent City.  
The dog’s carcass was found floating in the 
stream.
Despite the hazards of the forest, Tent City 
is the only home that many residents have, said 
Rod, a member of the homeless community.
Eviction notices came after Kenneth Griffin, 
65, stabbed two Tent City residents, damaging 
one of their lungs. Griffin had recently been re-leased from jail after serving 40 years for two kill-
ings and a manslaughter charge.
“The owners used to help Tent City and allow 
it to be in peace and harmony,” said Dan Griggs, 
a volunteer with HomeVan, a local homeless-aid 
organization.  “But the stabbing messed up a lot 
of stuff.”
However, Gainesville Police Department 
spokesman Keith Kameg said the eviction is 
about more than one incident.
“It’s not just about the stabbing,” Kameg said. 
“This is not a healthy or safe environment. The owners have a genuine concern for the people and don’t want to see people get hurt.”
Crime has also increased in the area, accord-
ing to Kameg. Drugs are being sold, prostitution has taken a foothold and stolen property is being taken to the area, he said. 
One resident thinks GPD convinced the own-
ers to evict the residents of the north side of Tent City to combat the growing drug problem there. 
“By law GPD can’t come to arrest people for 
drugs on private property without a warrant,” 
Rod said. “But if [they] get the people out, they 
can get to the drugs.”
Kameg disagrees, saying that displacing Tent 
City residents “is not our master plan. Our plan is to keep every resident of the community safe.”
Because of Tent City’s seclusion, residents 
open themselves up to being victimized, Kameg said.
“Is that right? No. Is that fair? No. But is that 
an absolute reality? Yes,” he said.
But Gunn believes that crime in Tent City is 
sensationalized. 
“Crime happens every day,” she said. “Sure 
it’s horrific, but crime is going to happen in any 
part of Gainesville.”
Kameg said that there are no easy solutions.               
“It is easy to blame police,” he said, “but enforce-
ment is not the total solution.”
And several homeless advocates agree.They believe more city involvement in terms 
of affordable housing, shelter, food and develop-ment programs are part of a total solution.
Michael Stoops, director of the Washington 
D.C.-based National Coalition for the Home-less, was critical of Gainesville’s attitude toward homeless people. 
“The city of Gainesville is not sheltering or 
feeding all of its homeless population, so the homeless have no other choice but to live in Tent City,” he said.
He recommends allowing grassroots pro-
grams to provide services and leadership devel-opment for the homeless.
Within the next month, the coalition will re-
lease its Criminalization of Homelessness Re-port, which rates the cities with the worst home-
lessness support, and Gainesville makes the list, 
he said.
Tent City residents who asked the city for 
help were referred to the Office of Homelessness 
for a place to go, but according to Gunn, there is 
no place for the displaced residents to go.
“From my perspective, there’s not much city 
support,” she said. “There’s no funding for all of these people. At least Tent City was a place for 
them to go.”
Gunn said she believes that there is an im-
pending crisis due to the uprooting of Tent City.
“I’m really frightened,” she said. “I believe 
we are going to see a massive influx of the home-
less population in the jail system.”
“They’re going to be in a really desperate state 
now that they were uprooted from their home, “ she said.
Some homeless people the will commit small 
crimes such as petty theft in order to find shelter when desperate. Even if that shelter is a jail cell, she said. 
“Alachua County Jail numbers are going to 
rise,” she said.
“The city and community are going to be 
quite shocked when they see a random, immense 
number of homeless people walking around the 
city,” she said. “The [city] population is very closed off from these things because of the large UF population.”
Gunn said she foresees a lot more problems 
and sickness due to the expected overcrowding of the south side of Tent City.
“There are people that have nine to five jobs 
and go home to Tent City because they can’t af-
ford housing, which can sometimes cost up to 
$2,000 a month.”
Currently the St. Francis House, which feeds 
and houses area homeless, has 35 beds and has already reached the limit. 
“I’d certainly be able to accommodate 60, 70, 
80 if I needed to under the emergency shelter rule,” said Kent Vann, executive director, “but that needs to be approved by the city.”
As of Tuesday evening Vann had not heard 
from the city. 
“I hope the city has an alternative for these 
people,” he said.

chua County Humane Society takes kittens 
from Animal Services and places them in foster homes.
The Humane Society offers a  program 
where members of the community can fos-ter litters until they are 8 weeks old.
The kittens are then eligible for adop-tion and brought back to the Humane So-
ciety to be placed in the kitten room where 
litters are usually placed together in pink cages, said Jaime Willson, animal care manager.
For those fostering, the Humane Soci-
ety provides food, litter and medical care for the animals.
Although they try not to split the litters 
up, Willson said those who want to foster kittens can request the amount they pre-
fer.
“They can specify if they want a single 
kitten or a mother with ba-
bies,” she said.
Willson said fostering is a 
great way for students to care 
for animals if their housing contracts al-low pets.
For those who are graduating soon, fos-ter care is a smart alternative to adopting 
a pet because students might not be able 
to take the animals with them after they leave, she said.
Those interested in adopting or foster-
ing kittens can contact Alachua County 
Animal Services at 352-264-6870 and the 
Alachua County Humane Society at 352-373-5855.Humane Society offers program that fosters kittens until eligible for adoptionTENT CITY , from page 1

tail section of a jetliner bearing Air 
France’s trademark red and blue 
stripes was recovered from the At-lantic Ocean Monday, helping nar-
row the hunt for “black boxes” that could explain what brought down 
Flight 447.
And some high-tech help is 
on the way — two U.S. Navy de-
vices capable of picking up the flight recorders’ emergency bea-
cons far below on the ocean floor. What caused the Airbus A330-200 
to plunge into the middle of the 
ocean on May 31 with 228 people 
on board might not be known until those black boxes are found.
But some Air France pilots 
aren’t waiting for a definitive an-
swer. With investigators looking at 
the possibility that external speed 
monitors iced over and gave dan-gerously false readings to cockpit 
computers in a thunderstorm, a 
union is urging pilots to refuse to 
fly Airbus A330 and A340 planes 
unless the monitors — known as Pitot tubes — are replaced.
An internal memo sent to Air 
France pilots Monday and ob-
tained by The Associated Press 
urges them to refuse to fly unless at 
least two of the three Pitot sensors 
on each planes have been replaced. 
The instruments have drawn at-
tention because of other incidents in which the monitors have iced 
over at high altitudes.
The leader of another pilots’ 
union, however, said Monday 
that Pitot troubles probably didn’t 
cause the Flight 447 disaster.
Searchers must move quickly to 
find answers in the cockpit voice 
and data recorders, because acous-
tic pingers on the boxes begin to 
fade 30 days after crashes.
While large pieces of plane de-bris — along with 16 bodies — has helped narrow the search, it re-
mains a daunting task in waters up 
to 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) deep and an ocean floor marked by rug-
ged mountains.
“Finding the debris helps be-
cause you can eliminate a large part 
of the ocean,” said U.S. Air Force Col. Willie Berges, chief of the U.S. 
military liaison office in Brazil and commander of the American mili-
tary forces supporting the search operation.
But ocean currents over the 
eight days since the disaster have 
pushed floating wreckage far and wide, complicating the search, 
Berges said. “In the sense that as 
the debris drifts away, you’re not 
sure exactly where the black boxes 
or other parts of the aircraft are on 
the bottom of the ocean.”
The U.S. Navy has helped lo-
cate black boxes in difficult situa-
tions before: pings from an Adam 
Air jet that crashed Jan. 1, 2007, off Indonesia’s coast were picked up 
25 days later by a navy team.
The two towed pinger locators 
the U.S. is sending are expected to 
arrive in Brazil late Monday and 
will be dropped into the ocean 
near the debris field by Thursday, 
Berges said. The search is focusing 
on several hundred square miles (square kilometers) roughly 400 miles (640 kilometers) northeast of 
the Fernando de Noronha islands 
off Brazil’s northern coast.
The listening devices them-
selves are five-feet long and weigh 
70 pounds. One will be towed by 
a Brazilian ship, the other by a 
French vessel, slowly trawling in a grid pattern across the search area. 
The devices can detect emergency 
beacons to a depth of 20,000 feet (6,100 meters).
Cables attached to the devices 
lead to on-board computers, en-
abling a 10-person team that ac-companies each device to listen for 
pings and to visually see them on a 
screen, like a radar spotting objects 
in air.
The French nuclear attack sub-
marine Emeraude, arriving later this week, also will try to find the 
acoustic pings, military spokesman 
Christophe Prazuck said.
If the pings are located, French 
deep-water unmanned subs 
aboard the oceanographic survey 
ship Pourquoi Pas will attempt to retrieve the boxes from the ocean floor.
This area of the Atlantic Ocean 
is littered with floating garbage, vexing the initial search effort. Days after the plane went down, 
the weather let up and bodies be-
gan to surface, giving searchers more to go on.
Sixteen bodies were recovered 
Saturday and Sunday about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from where 
the jet was last heard from. Bra-
zilian military officials said their 
earlier announcement of 17 was incorrect.
Searchers also spotted two 
airplane seats and debris with 
Air France’s logo, and recovered 
dozens of structural components from the plane. They had already 
recovered jet wing fragments, and 
said hundreds of personal items 
believed to from passengers were 
plucked from the water.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva said Brazil’s military would 
do all it can to recover bodies for grieving families. “During this painful time it’s not going to re-
solve the problem, but it is an im-mense comfort to know they can 
bury their loved ones,” he said on his national radio program Mon-
day.
France is leading the investiga-
tion into the cause, while Brazil 
focuses on the recovery of bod-
ies and wreckage. The Ventose, a French military frigate now oper-
ating under Brazilian command, 
has brought aboard seven of the 
16 bodies and about 30 pieces of debris that “most probably come 
from the plane,” Prazuck said.
Brazil says the search area lies 
southeast of the jet’s last transmis-
sion — automatic messages signal-ing catastrophic electrical failure 
and loss of cabin pressure. The 
messages mean Flight 447 likely 
broke apart in turbulent weather 
while flying from Rio de Janeiro to 
Paris. The location of the wreckage 
could mean the pilot was trying to 
turn around in mid-flight.10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2009

SOCCER SCHEDULE RELEASED FORMER GATORS ONLINE MLB DRAFTSouthern Miss ends UF’s College World Series hopes
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF pitcher Anthony DeSclafani walks with his hands on his head after the Gators’ 7-6 season-ending 
loss to Southern Miss in Game 2 of the NCAA Super Regional in McKethan Stadium on Sunday.
Kevin O’Sullivan’s words seemed 
to hit Brandon McArthur like a eu-logy. 
As the coach heaped praise on his third 
baseman, it brought the night into focus for 
McArthur, and he tugged his hat down to 
cover his eyes.
The 7-6 heartbreaking loss to Southern 
Miss had really happened. UF’s season was 
over, just two games shy of a trip to the Col-
lege World Series. And McArthur’s college 
career— maybe even his career as a player 
— was finished as well.
“He has meant everything to this pro-
gram,” O’Sullivan said. “He exemplifies 
leadership, character, toughness and com-petitiveness. I’ve told him a thousand times that his story will be told from team to team. 
“Whenever he’s back in the fall to come 
to football games and coming for weekends next spring, I want him talking to the team. I want the younger guys to know about Bran-don McArthur.”
McArthur’s tale is 
well-known by now. He enrolled at UF 
despite being chosen 
in the fifth round of 
the MLB Draft then missed his freshman year after a random 
act of violence out-
side a Gainesville bar 
led to surgeries and brain damage.
He later missed most of the 2007 season 
with a torn ligament in his right elbow, and 
he played on a torn ACL for part of 2008. 
Despite everything he went through dur-
ing his six years at UF, including a coach-ing change, McArthur stayed positive and served as a role model and leader.
He did his part Sunday night as well, 
slamming a home run and hitting a two-run single, efforts that helped the Gators build McArthur’s tale will not be forgottenThere’s a lot of coaches not named 
Meyer or Donovan making head-lines at UF. 
Athletics Director Jeremy Foley 
seems to have an all-star cast of coaches 
leading every team on campus. 
Two years ago, he brought in Kevin 
O’Sullivan to take an underachieving 
baseball program to the next level, and although Southern Miss ended UF’s season in Super Regional play, it’s ap-parent that O’Sullivan is right in line with Tim Walton and Amanda Butler as recent hires gone right.
Every good coach has something 
that separates them from the rest of the pack. 
In Urban Meyer’s case, his relent-
less recruiting, meticulous preparation and attention to detail has brought him two national championships in his four years as a Gator. 
In Billy Donovan’s case, his knack 
for X’s and O’s and the importance he places on playing “team” basketball al-lowed him to mold UF into a perennial SEC contender and occasional national title contender. In Kevin 
O’Sullivan’s case, his ability to connect with 
his players 
led the Gators 
to a national seed and the Gainesville Su-per Regional when they 
probably had no business even think-ing that was possible at the start of the season.
In the postgame press conference, 
sixth-year senior Brandon McArthur paid “Sully” one of the greatest com-pliments a coach can receive from a player. 
“Coach O’Sullivan, he really tried 
to talk me into (coming back) last sum-mer,” McArthur said. “And because of him, that’s why I came back.”
That’s a far cry from what’s been go-
ing on with Donovan’s basketball team lately. 
And it wasn’t just McArthur who Sully yet another successful hireBy KYLE MAISTRI

The Gators have come from be-
hind to win 27 games this season, but it was their inability to protect a five-run lead that ended their sea-son.
No. 10 UF (42-22) earned a na-
tional seed and hosted an NCAA Super Regional for the first time since 2005, when it made its last Col-lege World Series appearance, but it was Southern Miss (40-24) that ad-vanced to its first-ever CWS with a 7-6 victory Sunday when UF closer Billy Bullock couldn’t hold a 6-4 lead with two innings to play. 
“If you would have told me go-
ing into (Sunday) that we would have a two-run lead with six outs to go, and you have got Bullock rested and ready to go, I would have felt pretty good about it,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Bullock relieved junior Tony Da-
vis to start the eighth inning and put the first two runners on base after hitting Bo Davis and walking James Ewing. 
A strikeout and two singles later, the game was tied and the Eagles had runners on the corners with one out. 
Right fielder Tyler Koelling 
chopped the ball up the middle and shortstop Mike Mooney picked it up, stepped on second, jumped over the runner and fired to freshman Pres-ton Tucker at first base. The ball was just out of the left-hander’s reach, and the Gators were unable to turn the inning-ending double play. 
Heading into the top of the ninth, 
UF found itself in a familiar position, needing to score one run to extend

Southern Miss seniorTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Kobe Bryant has 
changed his look.
Gone is the teeth-baring, nose-
flaring, eyes-on-the-prize scowl that 
the Los Angeles Lakers star showed 
again and again in Game 1 of the 
NBA Finals. 
The intensity diminished after 
Game 2, his expression morphing into one of relief and sheer luck.
A botched layup by Magic rookie 
Courtney Lee is perhaps the biggest reason why these finals are not tied and Bryant still isn’t smiling even 
with his team up 2-0. 
That level of seriousness might 
be cause for Orlando to grimace.
The Magic nearly returned from 
Los Angeles with the best-of-seven 
series tied. 
Instead, they’re down 2-0, and 
now Bryant has a promise for Game 3 on Tuesday night.
“We’re about to kick it up,” he 
said. “You’d better believe it. We’re close. You see what I’m saying? 
“This is the finals. We’re going to 
be ready to go.”
For all the bravado, the Lakers 
can be careless, a team with holes and an inability to finish off an op-ponent as a champion must. 
They let Houston extend a series despite the absence of Yao Ming. Denver outmuscled and outhustled a Lakers team that seemed to lose its enthusiasm until Game 6 of the con-
ference finals.
Los Angeles believes those days 
are over.“We’re playing tougher,” for-
ward Pau Gasol said. “We under-
stand what it takes to go get the championship.”
This is a franchise closing in on 
its 15th title facing a Magic team still searching for its first finals victory. Bryant insists this is no time to 
get comfortable.
“What’s there to be happy 
about?” he asked. “The job’s not fin-
ished.”
The Magic have had their shots 
— one in particular — to change the series.
Lee missed a wide-open, alley-
oop layup that would have won 
Game 2 at the fourth-quarter buzzer 
Sunday night. 
Call it the “alley-oops.” This mis-
take, however, might hurt the most.
Orlando has been able to come 
back from seemingly every heart-
break this season — injuries, four last-second losses in the playoffs and series deficits in two rounds. 
But this could be too tough a 
challenge.  Only three teams have won a title after losing the first two games in the finals, most recently Miami over Dallas in 2006.
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy led 
the Heat to start that 2005-06 season before stepping aside. He was still on the Heat payroll, helping Pat Ri-ley from afar.
“Dallas never won another 
game,” Van Gundy said. “You know, series can change.”
The Magic would need quite a 
turnaround. Orlando had 20 turn-overs, just 22 assists and no true ball-handler to make the Lakers pay for double-teaming Dwight Howard. 
With Jameer Nelson coming off 
the bench in place of reliable reserve Anthony Johnson and Rafer Al-ston having already said he wasn’t pleased with his minutes in Game 1, Van Gundy might face another dilemma.
“We were just trying to see if we 
could get somebody out there who would make shots off of the double 
teams and off the pick-and-rolls and 
things like that,” Van Gundy said. “I thought our guys fought hard, but we couldn’t make enough plays. And the 20 turnovers crushed us.”TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

While all other UF sports have 
finished, track and field is gear-
ing up for its final meet of the season.
The men’s and women’s track 
teams will have 22 scoring oppor-tunities at the NCAA Champion-ships beginning Wednesday in Fayetteville, Ark.
“We expected a couple more 
to qualify, but you never bat a thousand in this sport,” UF coach Mike Holloway said. “We are very pleased with the chances we have.”
The No. 2 men’s team will 
have 10 individuals and two re-
lay teams participating in the 
four-day competition. The men, 
who are coming off of an NCAA 
East Regional Championship ear-
lier this month, aren’t worried about their drop to second in the rankings.
“We are focused on winning,” 
junior sprinter Calvin Smith said.  
“If we win, then we will be No. 1 
at the end of the season, and that 
is what matters.”
Mariam Kevkhishvili, the top 
women’s shot putter in the nation, 
placed first in both the Southeast-ern Conference Championship 
and the NCAA East Regional. 
Kevkhishvili is one of seven indi-viduals the No. 14 women’s team 
is sending to Fayetteville. 
She said her training has not changed since the beginning of the season and feels that UF 
coaches are trying to keep as much pressure off of the athletes 
as possible.
“We are trying to get ready for 
this big meet, and the pressure I 
feel is only from me,” she said. “The coaches cannot go out there and throw for you.”
The first event will be at 12:30 
p.m. on Wednesday, when SEC champion Gray Horn participates in the men’s decathlon.  Horn was the first UF man to win a confer-ence title in the decathalon.
UF’s 4x100m relay team holds 
the nation’s top time of 38.74 seconds. The team consisting of 
Dennis Martin, Smith, Terrell 
Wilks and Jeremy Hall won the 
event at the SEC Championship 
with that time and placed second at the NCAA East Regional with a time of 39.03 seconds.
“This is just another track 
meet,” Holloway said. “We are 
just going to go in there and take 
care of the Gators and worry 
about nothing else.”
On Monday, Holloway and 
Smith earned regional honors 
from the U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches As-sociation. Holloway was named the 2009  South Region Outdoor Men’s Track and Field Head 
Coach of the Year, and Smith was 
given the title of 2009  South Re-
gion Outdoor Men’s Runner of the Year.20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2009
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DUBLIN, Ohio — No one is surprised when Tiger 
Woods wins a golf tournament.
One reason he left Muirfield Village so satisfied 
with his second victory of the year is that Woods 
wasn’t surprised, either.
What most people will remember about his 7-un-
der 65 in the final round of the Memorial, which al-
lowed him to make up a four-shot deficit, is the flaw-
less finish. In a four-way tie for the lead as he stood on the 17th tee, Woods closed with two birdies, one from 9 feet to take the lead, and a 7-iron from 183 yards to within a foot that will become part of Me-
morial lore.
Woods, however, has a longer memory.
“It wasn’t just the last two holes,” he said. “It was 
all week.”
He only missed five fairways at Muirfield Vil-
lage, matching his most accurate tournament off the tee in his 13 years on tour (he also hit 49 fairways at the 1998 Masters). Woods twice hit powerful drives down the middle of the fairway on the par-5 15th on 
the weekend, both times leading to birdies. 
On the par-5 fifth Saturday, with enough breeze 
in his face that his 3-wood wasn’t quite enough, he 
choked up 2 inches on a driver and hit a baby cut, 
setting up another easy birdie. In the worst of the 
wind, he controlled the flight of his irons.
“I didn’t really have a problem hitting it either 
way,” Woods said. That’s when you feel like you’re in control of what you’re doing.”
Then came the most telling comment of all.“I didn’t hit any surprises out there,” he said.Nothing bothers Woods more than the double 
miss, not knowing whether an errant shot is going 
left or right.  That’s what he took to the first tee in the 
final round at the Masters and at The Players Cham-pionship. He didn’t finish either of those tourna-ments very well, leading to speculation that his game was not where it should be. But there was something 
different about the Memorial.
“If you look at how I won at Bay Hill, I only had 
101 putts,” he said. “Anyone who has 100 putts 
should win a tournament. I didn’t do it the way I did 
this week.”
What he had been missing was the ability to hit 
balls after his rounds, which Woods had not done 
for a year before surgery as ligaments in his left knee eroded.  That changed last month, when he went to 
the range for two days at Quail Hollow, more often 
at The Players Championship and then a lot more at home.
“My practice sessions started getting longer at 
home,” he said. “I needed to do the reps and do some good practice sessions this past couple of weeks. It came together this week.”
It’s no different from any other player, or any 
sport. A basketball fan and longtime friend of Mi-
chael Jordan, Woods earlier in the week recalled 
some hours he spent with Jordan in the gym feeding him the ball.
“He would just shoot all night,” Woods said. “We 
thought that, ‘Yeah, he just showed up to the game and off he went and scored 45 and went home.’ You don’t realize what he did to prepare for that.”Track teams open competition at NCAA Championships

As you may have noticed, coaches, 
players and media outlets alike are 
hopping on the Twitter bandwag-
on.
As you may have also noticed, we here 
at alligatorSports recently hitched our car 
to the Twitter train as well, posting break-
ing news and scores as well as our random 
musings on our page. At this point, we’d be left behind if we didn’t, given the way major sports media outlets are heading.
As much as I personally don’t enjoy the 
social networking system — my personal page has been updated about 10 times in nearly a month — I have to admit it has its merits. 
The alligatorSports account is already 
following coaches like UF’s own Urban Meyer and Tim Walton, Lane Kiffin of Ten-nessee, John Calipari of Kentucky and, of course, Ron Zook of Illinois. 
As a fan of unintentional comedy, I 
couldn’t help but laugh when an update from Zook began, “made a mistake yes-terday,” nor could I do anything but shake my head when reports surfaced about Kif-
fin’s secondary recruiting violation when 
a recruit’s name was posted on his Twitter 
feed. 
When stories regarding the potential 
transfers of UF basketball players Allan 
Chaney and Alex Tyus used their Facebook status updates as sources, I knew we were heading into uncharted territory.
We have reached the point where Twit-
ter posts are being read on SportsCenter. 
It’s terrifying. After the Magic won an NBA Playoffs game, the Worldwide Leader in 
Sports found it appropriate to post this pro-
found quote with the attribution to Dwight 
Howard’s Twitter Page:
“Win!!! We take game one. Let’s go!!”This is absurd for reasons aside from 
the disconcerting number of exclamation 
points used by a grown man.
Re-read that really quick. Does it tell 
you anything at all? Yes, they won. Yes, 
Dwight’s excited but has nothing to say 
of any value. What Howard wrote meant 
nothing, yet it was thrown around Sports-
Center like he had really just dropped some knowledge.
This is a scary precedent, and it’s only 
made worse by the fact that a lot of people 
are starting to view social networks as legit-
imate alternatives to real-life interactions, even in the cases of athletes.
One of the most followed athletes on 
Twitter is Shaq, whose page is hilarious at 
times and obnoxious at others — a true re-
flection of the man who updates it. 
After Shaq openly criticized Dwight 
Howard and Stan Van Gundy on his page, 
a Yahoo! Sports columnist wrote a piece about how imma-turely The Big Ar-
istotle, clearly jeal-
ous of the fact that Howard could be more successful than 
Shaq was as a young 
Magic center, was 
behaving.
Shaq responded 
with this post on 
Twitter, an attack on the columnist, the me-
dia and the English language: 
“O my yahoo sports wrote a bad article 
abt me , I’m gonna cry , yea rt, wanna kno 
the real its comn frm my shaqberry I’m da 
reporter now.”
It’s not like the columnist wrote any-
thing untrue. He was writing an opinion-
ated take on Shaq’s recent actions, but Wilt Chamberneezy, who has done a spectacu-
lar job of creating his own press throughout 
his career, didn’t like being called out.
As of Monday, Shaq has more than 1.18 
million followers, the 10th most of any-
one in the world — just three spots behind 
President Barack Obama. That number has 
probably gone to his head. If he wants to 
tell his fans something, why bother dealing with the media, which has been critical of him in the past? 
It’s become far too easy for anyone — even athletes — to simply bypass the media 
and remove themselves from any sense of 
responsibility and accountability.
So keep an eye on how the University 
Athletic Association, which is taking inter-
est in the world of social networks, encour-
ages the use of Twitter going forward.
Several coaches already have pages — 
and most of them are genuine, authentic, 
often insightful and  occasionally funny — and I would expect many more to follow.
(I’m incredibly excited at even the re-
mote possibility of a Billy Donovan Twitter account. However, if the first post doesn’t read, “Two straight NITs. Jai’s gone. Mar-reese is in the NBA. Tyus almost left. Nick 
went to play in Greece rather than stay. 
FML,” then I’ll be disappointed.)
But once again, this is uncharted terri-
tory. 
For fans, it’s an exciting way to stay up-
dated on the activities and thoughts of their favorite — or least favorite — players and 
coaches.
But at the same time, it’s potentially just 
one more way for those same players and 
coaches to not deal with the media, publi-
cizing the content they want seen and pre-
tending like the bad press doesn’t exist.
For better or worse, the runaway Twitter 
train is still picking up speed. Now we just 
have to see where it takes us.

MADRID, Spain — Real Madrid 
has announced the signing of Bra-
zilian star Kaka from AC Milan.
Madrid gave no financial de-
tails but reports on Monday said 
the Spanish club will pay Milan 
around 65 million euros ($92 mil-lion) for the attacking midfielder, making it one of the richest deals in soccer history.
The largest previous transfer 
was set by Zinedine Zidane when he joined Madrid from Juventus for $65 million in 2001.
Milan also confirmed Kaka’s 
transfer to Madrid on its Web site.
Kaka, who passed a medical in the northeastern Brazilian city of Recife earlier Monday, has signed a six-year contract.
“Kaka is one of the players that 
every team would like to have and Madrid had the chance to get him,” Madrid president Florentino Perez told radio station Onda Cero just before the signing was an-nounced.
The midfielder is the first player 
to join Madrid since Perez regained the club presidency unopposed 
last week.
Perez has said he intends to re-
vive his “galactico” policy which, 
as well as Zidane, attracted star players like David Beckham, Ron-aldo and Luis Figo to Madrid ear-lier this decade.
Kaka, who was the 2007 FIFA 
world player of the year, turned down a record 100 million euros 
transfer to Manchester City earlier 
this year.
Kaka, who is in Brazil with the 
national team for World Cup qual-ifiers and the Confederations Cup, said before he left he was happy in Milan. 
However, the size of Madrid’s 
bid appears to have proved too 
good for Milan to turn down. Last 
week, Milan president Silvio Ber-lusconi and chairman Adriano Gal-liani said the club could not afford its recent huge financial losses.
Perez is expected to attempt to 
sign several more top names for Madrid before the start of next season in August. Last week, he 
announced for the first time that 
Madrid would be looking to land Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo.
Perez is hoping to revive Ma-
drid’s fortunes after a poor season in which it failed to win any silver-ware, while archrival Barcelona won the Champions League and the league and cup double. 
The nine-time European cham-
pion Madrid has not reached the quarterfinals of Europe’s top club competition in the past five sea-sons.
Last week, Madrid appointed 
Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, former-ly of Villarreal, to replace Juande Ramos as coach.
The departure of Kaka, who 
won the Champions League with Milan in 2007 and the Italian league in 2004, came a week after the Ital-ian club’s coach Carlo Ancelotti left to take charge of Chelsea.

the game.
“Whoever told me in the press 
conference (Saturday) that Florida 
won a lot of games coming back from behind, I wish they never would have told me that because it was absolutely nerve-racking those last three outs,” the Southern Miss senior Ewing said.
Eagles closer Collin Cargill gave 
up a one-out single to Tucker, but Cargill got sophomore Josh Adams to hit into a double play to end UF’s season. 
“All year long we’ve been play-
ing teams that kick the ball around a little bit, but they played great de-fense,” O’Sullivan said.
Southern Miss advanced to the 
College World Series for the first time in program history in coach Corky Palmer’s final year. He an-nounced that he will be retiring after this postseason run. 
Before the season, Palmer told 
his team that he would be making the trip to Omaha at the end of the year, either as a spectator or fan.
“He said he was going with or 
without us,” Ewing said. 
The Golden Eagles chipped 
away at the five-run deficit as their bullpen shut down the Gators over the last four innings. 
Southern Miss starter Todd McInnis, Conference USA Pitcher of the Year, allowed six runs through the first three frames but managed to give his team two scoreless in-nings before handing the ball over 
to the bullpen. 
UF left seven 
runners on base, including five by Adams alone, and wasn’t able to put Southern Miss 
away.
“I was waiting for a leadoff walk 
or a leadoff double or an error by someone to open up the gates for us,” O’Sullivan said. “They just wouldn’t give in, and I think you have to credit their bullpen.”Credit the Eagles for declining to 
pitch to Tucker for the majority of the contest as well. 
After the freshman burned them 
for a solo home run in the first in-ning, Southern Miss intentionally walked Tucker in his next at-bat and walked him on four pitches in each of his next two at-bats. 
Adams couldn’t make Southern 
Miss pay from the cleanup spot in the order, driving in only one run despite coming to the plate twice with the bases loaded.
Even though they were unable 
to break the game wide open, the Gators seemed to seize control of the momentum in the fourth inning when Southern Miss cleanup hit-ter Corey Stevens was thrown out of the game after he collided with UF catcher Buddy Munroe at home plate.  By rule, runners are required to slide when there is a play at the plate in college baseball.
Stevens was trying to score from 
third on a short fly ball to right field, but he was thrown out to end the inning, killing the momentum the Eagles built by scoring two runs and loading the bases. 
UF freshman Nick Maronde 
made his first start since the South-eastern Conference Tournament, lasting three innings before turning the ball over to Davis, who gave up only one run in his 3.2 innings of work.
Gators’ bullpen fails to hold five-run lead in season-ending defeat
a 6-1 lead.
He’ll leave the program with no regrets, 
cherishing the good and bad memories he picked up along the way.
“Never once will I ever think I made 
the wrong decision by coming back here,” 
McArthur said. “Coach O’Sullivan, he really 
tried to talk me into it last summer, and it 
was because of him that I wanted to come back.”
Now, more than ever, McArthur wishes 
he could have another year. For the first time 
since the Gators finished second in Omaha 
in 2005, the baseball program is on the right track.
O’Sullivan’s recruiting and coaching has 
paid off, and there will be plenty of talent in town next season. That’s why — outside of those for McArthur — there were no tears at the postgame press conference.
Sure, it was a bummer to come so close 
to a CWS berth, but the future is as bright as ever.
“There are a lot of things to be excited 
about moving into next year, and I feel aw-fully bad for the seniors and other players that might move on in the draft,” O’Sullivan said. “I don’t want these guys hanging their heads. My philosophy always is, when the season’s over, it’s over. There’s no finger-
pointing or complaining.”
Nor should there be. The Gators far sur-
passed expectations this season, winning the 
Southeastern Conference East, earning a na-tional seed, beating Miami in a Regional and 
hosting a Super Regional.
They’ll lose pitchers Stephen Locke and 
Patrick Keating to graduation, but as the 
season wore on, UF leaned more and more on freshmen Anthony DeSclafani, Alex Pan-
teliodis and Nick Maronde. Those three will 
be back, along with Tommy Toledo, who 
missed the season due to injury after a great freshman campaign.
Prized recruits are on the way as well, 
and though the Gators will have to absorb 
the losses of Avery Barnes, Teddy Foster and 
McArthur at the plate, they’ll keep the heart of the order intact. 
The key will be keeping Matt den Dekker 
from leaving for a pro career, but even if he does, UF is in great shape.
This is as good as the program has looked 
in a long while. It’s just unfortunate timing that McArthur won’t be around to enjoy the ride with the team he helped shape.MIKE , from page 18
went on an unprompted tangent about 
his low-key coach. Junior Tony Davis immediately followed suit without any pressure from the media.
“I don’t think a lot of people real-
ize what this coaching staff has done for all of us,” Davis said. “You have to truly be on the inside of it to see the changes that they have made in all of us as players and as people. 
“This coaching staff has been unbe-
lievable.”
Prior to the season, Sully worked on 
transforming Davis, who was predom-
inantly used as a left-handed specialist 
in 2008, into a setup man who could 
work multiple innings if needed. 
Davis added about 5 mph to his 
fastball, and on Sunday, he pitched 3.2 
innings against the Golden Eagles, a 
new career high. 
O’Sullivan has had success from a purely baseball perspective, but it’s 
the way he treats people that is most impressive.
He handles any problems with 
performance or attitude in-house and never sells out his players to the media 
in an effort to motivate them. 
When roles need to be changed, he 
does so without embarrassing anyone 
who might not be playing as much for lack of performance. 
He’s loyal but not to the point of 
being unwilling to make the necessary changes. 
Senior Patrick Keating started the 
year as the team’s ace and Friday starter but quickly found himself in the bullpen after a dozen or so rough outings. Every single time someone asked Sully about Keating, he said the same thing: “I really believe he’s going to figure it out.”
That’s the type of coach players love 
to play for and everyone respects.KYLE , from page 18BASE , from page 18

Roger Federer celebrates after defeating Robin Soderling during the men’s singles final 
of the French Open at Roland Garros in Paris on Sunday.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PARIS — As of about noon Monday, Rog-
er Federer hadn’t received a congratulatory 
call from Rafael Nadal, the man he succeeded as French Open champion.
Who did touch base? Who did send along 
good wishes when Federer won his first title at Roland Garros to complete a career Grand Slam and tie Pete Sampras’ record of 14 Grand Slam titles?
None other than Federer’s pal Tiger 
Woods, another man who owns 14 major championships. Yes, Woods showed up to the driving range a little later than usual Sun-day before playing the final round of the Me-
morial. He watched Federer win in his fourth 
trip to the French Open final, and they chat-ted afterward.
“I was pulling for him. I was as nervous 
as can be for him,” Woods said after rally-ing from a four-shot deficit to win in Dub-lin, Ohio. “I was yelling at the TV, the whole deal.”
It’s a shame more people in the United 
States weren’t watching, too. NBC’s coverage of Federer’s 6-1, 7-6 (1), 6-4 victory over Robin Soderling at Roland Garros drew a 1.8 over-
night rating — meaning fewer than 2 percent 
of homes with televisions in the country’s largest markets tuned in. The CBS broadcast of Woods’ victory drew a 3.6 overnight rat-ing. Sampras was among those who caught some of Federer’s performance on television. Home in Los Angeles, he also saw parts of Federer’s earlier matches at this year’s French 
Open.
“I watched enough to see that he maybe 
wasn’t at his best and went through some 
tough matches that the great ones always find a way to win — and on a surface that is his least favorite,” Sampras said. “He just dug deep.”
Like Woods with a golf club in his hands, 
Federer with a racket is something special to behold. Good as they are, both are con-stantly looking for ways to improve: After re-cently deciding to try drop shots more often, Federer earned five winners off them against Soderling.“For a few years, there was probably three 
or four areas of his game that were arguably 
the best in the word, from movement to fore-
hand to shot selection to net game,” said An-dre Agassi, one of the other five men to have won each of tennis’ major tournaments. “He just has it all.”
Like the 33-year-old Woods, the 27-year-
old Federer gets called the “greatest to ever play,” even though his career has years to go.
Like Woods, Federer is talented and inno-
vative, someone who not only is capable of dominating a sport but also of changing the way opponents play and train.
“Roger made everybody play better. He 
made every tennis player in the world be better if they want to play with him,” said Guillermo Vilas, who won four Grand Slam titles in the 1970s. “That’s why everybody 
learns new shots and works differently: ‘Rog-
er’s doing this, we have to do the same.’”
Like Woods, Federer does a good job of 
blocking out potential distractions. One ex-ample: Federer’s father wasn’t in the stands at Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday, having returned to his hotel because he came down with a virus.
Like Woods, Federer knows how legacies 
are built.
“For me,” Federer said Monday, “it’s 
about the majors, really, right now.”
Federer lost to Nadal in the three previ-
ous French Open finals, and the Swiss star acknowledged feeling the pressure to come through this time after Nadal lost to Soder-ling in the fourth round. Federer knew his-tory would view him differently if he could 
finally win in France.
“It’s going to take time for me to realize 
what I just did,” Federer told The Associated 
Press. “I might see things very differently right now. I don’t know. But at the moment, I’m just so happy. I’m so proud that I was able to come through after so many years coming so close.”
Woods and Federer share a management 
agency and sponsors. They’ve filmed com-mercials together. They’ve also shown up to see the other compete in person.TENNISTiger watches, praises

� THE RAYS ARE ON PACE TO LEAD 
THE AL IN STOLEN BASES.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ST. PETERSBURG — The Tampa Bay Rays 
offer no apologies for being modern-day ma-rauders.
Carl Crawford & Co. are ripping and run-
ning, leading a revival of the stolen base and showing no signs of slowing down. 
The rest of a once-plodding American 
League is trying to keep pace.
“We like to put pressure on the other 
team,” Crawford said. “We don’t like to wait around for the big home run, even though we can do that.”
With Crawford, the major league leader 
and four-time AL steals champion, as well as B.J. Upton and Jason Bartlett showing the way, the speedy Rays are on their way to swiping more bases than any other team for the second straight year.
Their 91 steals entering Monday were 26 
more than the nearest challenger, as well as the most in the AL after 58 games since Rickey Henderson and the 1982 Oakland Athletics 
had 100, and tops in the majors at the same 
point in a season since the 1991 Montreal Ex-pos had 94.
What’s surprising, though, is the AL as 
a whole is on pace to outsteal the National 
League for the first time since 2001. 
That’s only happened three other times 
in the last 20 years (1989, 1992 and 1998).The 
Rays are most responsible for the trend.
“They know we’re going to run,” Upton 
said. “You can’t say there’s no stopping it, but the bottom line is we’re going to run any time we get a chance.”
Manager Joe Maddon turned his young, 
hungry team loose during Tampa Bay’s im-
probable run to the World Series a year ago. 
The AL champions are creating even more 
havoc on the basepaths with a stolen base suc-
cess rate of just over 84 percent this year.
Crawford, who tied the modern major 
league single-game record with six against Boston on May 3, entered Monday night’s game against the New York Yankees with more steals (34) than 15 teams. 
The closest team to the Rays in the NL was 
the New York Mets with 56. Upton and Bar-tlett, hitting .373 before being injured, also are 
in the top 10 in steals.
Still, Tampa Bay is not a team that thrives 
on speed alone. 
Carlos Pena and Evan Longoria are among 
the league leaders in homers and RBIs, and the 
team’s ability to force mis-
takes with aggressive bas-erunning has helped both sluggers.
With Upton, Crawford 
and the Rays’ other bases-
tealing threats constantly on the move, Longoria is seeing fewer breaking balls 
and feasting on fastballs at the plate.  Oppos-
ing teams also are reluctant to pitch around 
the 2008 AL rookie of the year because of Pe-na’s potent bat.
“Sometimes you can get pitchers more 
worried about us on the basepaths than wor-ried about the hitter. When you can do that, they have the tendency to maybe leave the ball over the plate a little bit more,” Upton said.
The 27-year-old Crawford has the best sto-
len base percentage in AL history, including 34 for 37 (91.9 percent) this year, and his 83.6 percent career success rate ranks third all-time 
behind Tim Raines and Eric Davis.
He’s on pace to swipe a career-best 95. That 
would be the most since Vince Coleman stole 
109 for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987. 
Only two AL players — Ichiro Suzuki (56 
steals in 2001) and Chone Figgins (62 in 2005) — have led the majors since Henderson won the last of his 12 AL stolen bases titles in 1998.
Crawford scoffs at the notion that he could 
wind up stealing 100.
Even though Maddon encourages the 
Rays to be aggressive — the manager admits “there’s only a few red lights” — Crawford feels the running takes a toll on his legs, par-
ticularly with Tampa Bay playing more than 
half its games on artificial turf.
“The body takes such a banging, I probably 
wouldn’t be able to walk come September. I 
don’t ever say what a person can’t do, but I definitely think 100 is a little out of reach,” Crawford said.
“You’re going to have to say I’m going to 
steal 100, and you’re going to have to take off every time you get on base. That’s not count-ing the times you get thrown out. It’s a lot of running you’re talking about.”Crawford & Co. creating increased havoc on basepaths
