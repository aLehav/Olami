A man who allegedly stole 
gold and cash and ﬂ  ed with a gun 
Wednesday is now in custody.
Kouvaris Lamar Roberts was ar-
rested on felony charges of robbery 
with a weapon and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon.
Gainesville Police and the Uni-
versity Police Department respond-ed to calls at 2:13 p.m. about a man carrying a handgun who was limp-ing westbound down an Archer Road sidewalk.
A UF Alert was sent out via text 
message and email at 2:29 p.m. A second message at 2:44 p.m. said police found the man and took him 
into custody.
Police believe the man robbed 
Gold Buyers of Gainesville at 2320 SW Archer Road, according to GPD 
ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Police described the man as 
5-foot-10, 160 pounds and in his 20s. 
He ﬂ  ed the scene, struck by gun-
ﬁ  re at least once.
An eyewitness employee at a 
neighboring Jiffy Lube said he only heard and saw one shot being ﬁ  red outside of the shop.
The employee, who asked to re-
main anonymous, said he saw a man slip on a dark ski mask before he entered Gold Buyers of Gainesville around 2 p.m.
About ﬁ  ve minutes later, the al-
leged robber and a man from the store came outside. 
Then, the man ﬁ  red a round at 
the suspect.
“[The suspect] grabbed his ass,” 
said the Jiffy Lube employee. “Then 
he ran off.”

Alligator Writer
Bus service will be reduced during 
the weeklong break between Summer 
A and Summer B.
The Gainesville Regional Transit 
System announced Monday its plan to reduce service from June 23 to July 1.
According to a press release from 
RTS, service on routes 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 23, 34, 35 and 43 will be re-duced.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner said 
there will be fewer buses running on those routes.
“With students leaving town, we 
noticed a reduced demand,” he said.
The remaining city routes — 1, 2, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 15, 24, 25, 36 and 75 — will follow the regular summer 2012 weekday schedule.
RTS will resume its normal sum-
mer service on July 2.
Weekend routes will remain un-
changed, with the exception of route 126, which will not be in service.
No buses will be running through 
the UF campus during the break.
The Later Gator nighttime routes 
will resume on July 5, according to the release.
Routes 22, 27, 28, 29, 46, 62 and 76 
will not be in service until the begin-ning of the Fall semester on Aug. 19.

UF student Rob Wheeler Jr. starts a three-
day, 150-mile trek from Gainesville to Talla-
hassee Monday.
The 20-year-old political science and his-
tory junior will walk from Gainesville to High Springs on Monday.
The next day, he will cycle from High 
Springs to Lamont, and Wednesday he will walk from Lamont to Tallahassee. 
It adds up to about 150 miles.The trek is Wheeler’s way of giving back 
to his church, St. Peter’s Anglican Church in Tallahassee, and raising money for the con-struction of its new building.
During high school, Wheeler was a devout 
Christian. But once he started college, things changed and he lost focus.
By spring 2012, Wheeler was regularly 
blacking out from drinking, yelling at his girl-friend and ﬁ  ghting with his family.
“I turned my back on everyone,” he said.His mom, Kim Wheeler, said she noticed 
her son was not as kind and considerate as he had been.He became a member of Theta Chi Fra-
ternity, held leadership positions in Student Government and Gator Growl and joined Florida Blue Key. He is currently a District B senator.
“I was so caught up in myself,” he said.It was after a blacked-out night when he 
argued with his girlfriend again that he real-ized he needed to change.
When he came home for Spring Break, he 
went back to church.
His mom said she saw him change back to 
the way had used to be.
“The biggest change in Rob is that he 
is much happier and seems to be less bur-dened,” she said.
But Rob Wheeler Jr. still felt like he owed UF Senator to begin 150-mile 
trek to Tallahassee Monday
“The biggest change in Rob is 
that he is much happier and seems 
to be less burdened.”

Gelato for dogs as Italy heats up
ROME — Leave it to Italians 
to come up with just the thing to survive the dog days of summer: canine gelato.
This Italian ice cream for dogs 
contains no milk, eggs or sugar, which are harmful to canines. With temperatures in Rome topping 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit) this week, dogs are lapping up the icy treat at a pet supply store on the out-skirts of the capital.
Dog owner Anna Bordoni 
couldn’t resist a taste from her mutt Elsa’s cup and declared it “fantastic.”
Rome vetrinarian Marialivia 
Palmieri says water remains the best cool-down treat for dogs. But she said the special canine gelato does dogs no harm — and can be gratifying for pet and owner.
Flavors come in vanilla, rice 
and yogurt and a serving costs 2 euro  ($2.50).

Ohio candy thief targets mostly 
peanut butter cups
LORAIN, Ohio — Police 
in northern Ohio are trying to 
identify a candy thief who stole hundreds of dollars in peanut butter cups from a gas station store.
Employees reported that a 
young man usually comes in af-ter midnight, snatches Reese’s peanut butter cups and exits the store before they can call police. The workers say the candy sto-len over the past few months was worth $400 to $600.
The Morning Journal reports 
the latest theft happened early Tuesday morning. A police re-port indicates the man stole peanut butter cups and went for a saltier snack, grabbing a bag of chips. He was dressed in black clothing, with a hooded sweatshirt over his head.
A clerk says he tried to stop 
the thief, who spun him around and fled on foot.

Kelsey Stinnett would rather 
give up sex for a weekend than go 
without her smartphone.
Stinnett, a 21-year-old UF polit-
ical science senior, isn’t alone. Ac-cording to a study released Mon-day , 15 percent of iPhone users would choose a sex-free weekend over giving up their phone for the same amount of time.
Gazelle.com surveyed 1,000 iP-
hone users in honor of the iPhone’s fifth birthday, which is June 29.
Stinnett said one of the main 
reasons she’d choose a smartphone over sex is because she doesn’t feel safe without it.
She’d also be wary of giving up 
the phone’s convenience.
“Everything’s here — the phone 
calls, the texts and the Internet — all in one spot,” she said.
Sophia Acord, a professor in 
UF’s department of sociology , criminology and law who has con-ducted research at Rutgers Uni-versity’s Center for Mobile Com-munication Studies, said there is evidence dating back to the 1990s showing mobile devices have caused a decrease in the quality of face-to-face interaction.
She said people can feel the 
need to connect with others who aren’t with them, even if they’re with a group of friends.
“You buy it for one thing, and it 
begins to nudge its way into every aspect of your life,” she said.  
Daniel Siefman, a 21-year-old 
nuclear engineering senior, was surprised by the study’s results.
Although he once walked into 
a pole while staring at his iPhone, he said he can go without it.
“For some people it’s like their 
life anchor,” he said. “It keeps them connected to the world, and they can’t live without it.”Some iPhone users

After extending the application 
period, the Student Senate approved 
a new Supervisor of Elections at Tuesday’s meeting.
Student Body President Tj Vil-
lamil left this position open later than others, hoping that more peo-ple would apply . UF junior Stephen Davis was chosen.To qualify for Supervisor of Elec-
tions, the candidate must have been an assistant to the Supervisor or on the election commission for at least one SG election.
Davis was an assistant to the Su-
pervisor of Elections in Spring 2011.  
Jordan Eddy and Damario Major 
also applied for the position. Eddy served as an assistant for the last three elections, and Major served as an assistant in the 2010-2011 school year.
However, Vil-
lamil said he went with Davis because he was a “fresh face.”
Villamil also 
said the Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 elections were not run smoothly.
Major was not involved in the last two elections, Villamil said, but during his interview for the Supervi-sor of Elections position, Major said he thought both were run well.
“That answer was not satisfac-
tory,” Villamil said.
Sen. Max Stein said he was con-
cerned that Davis has not been involved in the relatively recent electronic voting process for two se-mesters, and that Davis is a member of Villamil’s fraternity.Davis was not available for ques-
tioning at the meeting.
Stein said he would have liked to 
ask Davis questions about party af-filiation and experience directly.
“I have to assume the worst-case 
scenario,” he said.
The senators also approved the 
amended 2012-2013 Activity and Service Fee budget.

The trek, inspired by ‘Forrest Gump,’ gives Wheeler time to think 
something — to the church, friends and fam-
ily.
“Just saying I changed wasn’t enough,” 
he said.
He started fundraising a month ago for 
the new church. Since then, he has raised more than $500.
The church hopes to open on Christmas Eve 2013, Wheeler said.
The Rev. Andrew Rowell, an associate 
rector, said the church needed a total of $8 million to build the new space. He said they have wanted to build it for years and are in the final push with the last million dollars.
Wheeler got the idea for the trek from the 
movie “Forrest Gump.”  
He thought walking would give him time 
to think, and other people could join him. Rowell hopes to join Wheeler the second day.
Rowell has known Wheeler since he was 
a freshman in high school. He said he thinks Wheeler’s trek is ambitious.
“It’s a bold and noble thing to do,” he 
said.
Rowell used to be a distance cyclist and 
said that even for a cyclist, 97 miles is hard.
Wheeler is nervous for the cycling, but he has been training every day for three weeks.
He has been riding his bicycle for an hour 
and walking 30 minutes every day.
His family will also drive behind him for 
moral support and whatever else he might need.
“I had been so bad to other people,” 
Wheeler said. “This was my own sacrifice.”

An image from documents released from the U.S. Attorneys’ office Monday shows the fossil of a Tyrannosau -
rus bataar dinosaur. A lawsuit brought by the U.S. government demanded Monday that the fossil be turned 
over to the United States by an auction house so that it can be returned to its home in Mongolia.
� THE FOSSIL IS BELIEVED 
TO HAVE BEEN ILLEGALLY IMPORTED TO GAINESVILLE.

Wanted: an 8-foot-tall, 24-foot-
long Tyrannosaurus bataar dinosaur 
fossil worth about $1 million.
On Tuesday , a New York federal 
judge requested the Department of Homeland Security to seize the remains of a 70-million-year-old dinosaur artifact in New York City believed to have been stolen from Mongolia.
The fossil was illegally imported 
from Great Britain to Gainesville in March 2010 by an unidentified buyer.
Beverly Sensbach, assistant direc-
tor of the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History, said the museum didn’t promote the fossil while it was in the city.“We have personally never seen 
it,” she said.
According to a civil complaint, 
documents given to officials con-tained false information about the artifact, which incorrectly said it was from Great Britain and was worth $15,000.
On May 20, the fossil was sold to 
an anonymous buyer for $1,052,500.
Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-
based auction company overseeing the sale, halted the sale on May 21 pending an investigation into the fossil’s origins.
The artifact is currently located 
in an art storage facility in New York City.
“We have cooperated in the in-
vestigation process for paleontolo-gists to expeditiously examine the skeleton, and we will continue to cooperate with authorities,” said Jeff Halperin, co-founder of Heritage Auctions, in a statement.

Darts & Laurels
After a congressional oversight committee requested 
documents from the Obama administration surrounding 
the failed gun enforcement operation known as “Fast and Furious,” the administration responded by using executive privilege to withhold these materials. For this, we throw an are-you-telling-me-that-politicians-are-hypocrites DART  
at President Barack Obama for not only invoking execu-
tive privilege, but for doing so after arguing against its use by President George W. Bush in 2007.
However, we will be giving a ﬁ  nally-a-change-in-immi-
gration-policy-that-makes-sense LAUREL to the Obama 
administration for giving undocumented students brought to the U.S. before the age of 16 the ability to obtain a work permit and protection from deportation for two years.
Regardless of your views on immigration policy, chil-
dren should not be held responsible for the actions of their parents.
It has been argued, but not proven, that the brutal can-
nibalistic attack that occurred in Miami in May was caused by so-called “bath salts,” a product used as a synthetic drug. This leads us to our expanding-the-black-market-and-giving-criminals-more-money DART at the Miami-
Dade County Commission, which started the process to ban the product.
Good job. No one ever smokes marijuana anymore be-
cause it’s illegal, right?
Next, we give an opening-the-door-to-new-discoveries 
LAUREL to UF researchers, who found that a genetically 
modiﬁ  ed version of the bacterium lactobacillus acidophi-lus, naturally produced in the human gut and found in cer-tain yogurts and cheese, reduces inﬂ  ammation or growths that can result in colon cancer in mice. That’s pretty cool, huh?
For causing mischief on Interstate 275 in St. Petersburg, 
Fla., we throw an I’m-going-down-and-I’m-taking-every-one-else-with-me DART at an alligator that authorities are 
blaming for two car crashes on the highway. Although the gator survived the ﬁ  rst collision, it wasn’t so lucky the sec-ond time.
Fortunately, there were no human injuries.Finally, we throw a yes-there-were-only-two-laurels-
this-week-but-we-can’t-NOT-address-this DART at New 
Line Cinema and Warner Bros., whose lack of enthusiasm for the “Dumb and Dumber” sequel caused Jim Carrey to back out of the project.
This is ridiculous.Have a fun and safe break, and be sure to check back 
Summer B.President Obama displays incompetence
Well, I’m just going to come right out and say it. 
President Obama is arguably the worst president in American history. Never have the American 
people been sold such a bill of goods as they have with this man.
Yes, I consider myself to be politically conservative, and 
no, I did not vote for Obama. I’m sure this surprises no one.
Full disclosure is important. But if you think I’m harsh 
in my dislike of the man’s conduct in his duties as the com-mander in chief, you can’t imagine how much more upset I would be with him had I actually voted for him.
Maybe I can put that into better perspective.In 2004, fewer than 60 days after returning home from a 
tough tour in Iraq, I was absolutely furious with the Bush administration. So this lifelong Republican marched down to the polling place and cast my vote for John Kerry.
I did not vote for him because I was suddenly a born-
again Democrat, but rather because I believed then, as I do now, that when leadership failure occurs, it is the people’s obligation to hold elected ofﬁ  cials to the highest standards. Sometimes the ﬁ  ring is far more important than the hir-ing.
If I was one who viewed Obama as an inspiring leader, 
a unifying force or even the man of destiny that the presi-dent obviously feels he is, I would still be extremely puz-zled about what’s going on in his mind.
Where are the successes?Right now, the prevailing narrative coming from White 
House ofﬁ  cials is essentially, “We just need more time. Ev-erything was worse than we thought.” During his latest speech in Cleveland, the president explained that reces-sions like the current one historically take more than a de-cade to sort out.
I’d like to know who put that on the teleprompter. 
Apparently the president has such a low opinion of the American public that his best argument, his most inspir-ing pep talk to the voters, essen-tially amounts to, “Don’t expect much.”
I do not hate Obama. On 
the whole, he seems like a very charming and personable fellow. However, he is absolutely falling down on the job, and our coun-try is suffering for it. Therefore, I hold him responsible.
Conversely, I hold no great love for his opponent, Mitt 
Romney. In many ways, he seems very similar to Obama; only he does seem to know how to operate a calculator, balance a budget and manage something other than a ce-lebrity fundraiser.
Speaking of fundraisers, the president has done more 
than 140 of them; twice as many as the next most proliﬁ  c presidential fundraiser, George W. Bush. If each gala runs at about two hours in length, that equals seven full work-weeks. This is disgraceful, even if you don’t consider the expense to the taxpayer for his travel and security details.
The only thing I would say to this very charming and 
personable fellow in the White House is that yes, President Obama, America is watching you.
Everything he does seems to be painted as “historic,” 
and for good reason. No president has ever proven to be this historically disengaged, so historically absent or so historically incompetent to meet the challenges of his of-ﬁ  ce.
I’m therefore predicting a historically bad night for him 
in November because Americans understand, this time now more than ever, that the ﬁ  ring is more important than the hiring.
I know I’m hoping for some real change.Joshua Fonzi is a microbiology and cell science and ento-
mology and nematology senior at UF. His column appears on Thursdays.

What happened to free speech 
and common courtesy?
I’ve been a student senator since the last election in spring, and one thing has been made 
abundantly clear in my short time in the Senate: The Unite Party doesn’t like being told that they’re wrong or that they’re corrupt and incompetent, or even that you want to amend one of their bills to be grammatically correct.
It’s partisanship on a level of 
its own.
And that’s fine. No one likes 
hearing bad things about them-selves. I’m just as likely to get up-set by an insult as the next guy. But while I disagree with what they might have to say, I don’t cut off their ability to say it.
Beyond being a First Amend-
ment right granted by the Consti-tution, it’s common courtesy.
For those of you not familiar 
with the way Senate works, we run our meetings using Robert’s Rules of Order. When debating a bill, any side can make the motion to “call the previous question,” which essentially cuts off all de-bate and moves directly into vot-ing on a bill.
It’s the Unite Party’s favorite 
motion and probably the only one most of their senators know (I’ve yet to hear most of them speak, so I can’t be sure).
Now, even within Robert’s 
Rules of Order, calling the pre-vious question is regarded as a highly disrespectful motion, espe-cially if someone else still wants to speak.
But Unite Party Sen. Andrew 
Schein takes disrespect to a com-pletely new level when he stands up (generally during debate time) and calls the previous question only to then vote in favor of the bill. It’s a disgusting maneuver and shows how little respect he has for the 49 percent of students who voted against his party in the last election.
To further demonstrate the 
point, after bill presentation, questions and three full rounds of pro-con debate (the maximum al-lowed without a motion to extend) you’ve exhausted a maximum of 28 minutes. If his party wants to vote in favor or against a bill, we can’t stop them, but I would hope that he would at least have the re-spect to allow the representatives of the Student Body to speak on behalf of their constituents.
The Unite Party’s actions thus 
far into the summer session have been the exact opposite of their promises to increase communica-tion and transparency.
I just wish they’d have the de-
cency to stop being so intellectu-ally dishonest about their views and actually say they don’t care about what anyone has to say.

Students Party SenatorLetter to the Editor
Recent economic growth numbers are begging the question: 
are we getting out of the recession any time soon? 
The daunting question looms like a dark cloud over the 
heads of lawmakers and business owners who don’t know what to expect from a lethargic economy. 
This uncertainty is stifling action in the private sector. A disappointing May jobs report pushed the unemployment 
rate back to 8.2 percent, and there is already extra doubt about the modest growth estimates for the second quarter.
Historically, economic growth has been fastest after a down-
turn. 
In 1934, following the Great Depression, the U.S. economy 
grew an unprecedented 10.9 percent. 
However, since 2009, the average annual growth rate has been 
2.4 percent, while the long-term trend in the U.S. has been 3.1 percent since 1948. 
So why do we still see sluggish growth?Among the many factors that influence the health of the econ-
omy, one reality is that the economy reacts to perception. 
If you don’t believe you’ll have a job tomorrow, you’re un-
likely to buy a new house today. You will probably save your money instead. 
Likewise, a business apprehensive about prospective income 
is unlikely to spend money on new hires. 
Even with the Federal Reserve driving interest rates near zero, 
employers are reluctant to take risks with a lack of confidence in the recovery.
Over the last several years, a wave of new policies and politi-
cal events has given rise to uncertainty in the political and eco-nomic climate. 
The health care overhaul will implement sweeping changes 
for employers beginning in 2013. 
Recently, I was able to attend a presentation by Gary Ellis, the 
chief financial officer of Medtronic. 
He explained how the type of system adopted by the U.S. was 
less of a concern to them than figuring out the details of the bill. 
“We operate in all health care systems of the world and turn 
a profit,” he said. “We’re more concerned about figuring out ex-actly what is in this bill.” The effect this bill will have remains 
hazy even for those closely watching it.
Last year, the Bush-era tax cuts were 
extended, but only until Jan. 1, 2013. Without knowing whether the tax cut will be extended again, business owners are wary of commitments. 
The effect of a tax cut to stimulate 
hiring in the economy is diminished by its short-term nature.
Last summer, Republicans and Democrats clashed over the 
debt ceiling until the 11th hour. 
This event was toxic for the markets, amplified fear over the 
ability to contain public debt and led to a credit downgrade for the government. 
Worst of all, a sequel may be right around the corner as the 
debt nears its ceiling again.
The press’ favorite two words in 2010 were “double dip,” 
which has not helped quell the uncertainty. 
With incessant questioning of the U.S.’s potential to relapse 
into recession to the current debt debacle of Europe, the financial press has been filled with fear.
Lawmakers can help ameliorate this uncertainty. First, they 
must provide the business community with lasting solutions, not temporary fixes. 
They need to be efficient in making decisions and avoid 
drawn-out political battles. 
This is especially important for debate on the debt ceiling, as 
strong creditworthiness is crucial for the nation’s economy. 
Second, President Barack Obama’s administration needs to 
work on the clarity of the health care overhaul and finish crafting the language of the recent reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform bill. 
Businesses need to know what they are up against. Lastly, lawmakers should remember that real solutions often 
require politically tough decisions, and if the economy is doing well, the people will trust those tough decisions.

Silvertree999
TelaArtes
GatorMadeKATHRYN VARN
Avenue Writer
In lab, Anna Melnichuk is a 29-year-
old graduate student working toward a 
master’s degree both in physical chem-istry and electrical engineering. On the social networking and shopping web-site, Etsy, she is Silvertree999, armed with handmade jewelry and nature photographs taken with her mother’s 35mm Minolta, a retro film camera.
These personas are seemingly unre-
lated, but Melnichuk disagrees.
“Science and art really go hand in 
hand,” she said. “You have to be a cre-ative person to do well in science.”
Melnichuk, who spent her teen-
age years in Brooklyn, N.Y ., painted throughout high school. She was ac-cepted to the School of Visual Arts, Sa-vannah College of Art and Design and other well-known art schools, as well as waitlisted at Carnegie Mellon for phys-ics.
She kept her name on the waitlist 
thinking she wouldn’t get in.
“I wouldn’t have to make a decision, 
upset parents, et cetera,” she said, “and then I got in, and there was nothing I could say after that.”
Thus, her 11 years and counting of 
schooling began. Melnichuk attended the University of Hawaii after graduat-ing from Carnegie Mellon with a Bach-elor of Arts in chemistry. She received her master’s in chemistry at Hawaii and came to UF in 2006.
In Gainesville she’s developed a cre-
ative outlet taking photographs of flow-ers and sunsets at Paynes Prairie. Jew-elry making started for Melnichuk as an accident after her bracelet broke.
At the bead store she had a thought; 
“Oh, there’s a lot of stuff here, this is kind of fun.”  So, she started buying, making things and taking classes.  
To Melnichuk, her art is a stress re-
lief from her work with UF’s Quantum Theory Project. Because of this, jewelry making and photography indirectly supplement her work in the same way that a hot shower or a few hours at the gym seem to generate the best ideas.
“If you think of something else, if 
you read a book that’s not related to your work at all, at some point, just do-ing that clears your mind,” she said.
She put her work on Etsy in Febru-
ary and has had one sale so far from a very supportive aunt.
“Someone ordered this pendant, this 
pricey piece, and I didn’t think it would be the first thing to sell,” she said, laugh-ing.
Melnichuk hopes to sell most of her jewelry stock by the time she leaves Gainesville next year. Even with her stack of chemistry degrees, she ac-knowledges art as an important part of her life.
“I always tell my students not to 
think of science as this dry thing,” she said. “If you’re going to be good, you have to be creative. Otherwise, you re-ally are a drone.”

To Kathryn Wilson, The Gator Na-
tion knows no bounds.
Wilson uses Etsy to display and sell 
her products online, her shop is called GatorMade.
Her creations embody a home foot-
ball game — bags, flip-flops and jewel-ry all orange and blue — and also bring The Swamp spirit abroad in the form of pillows, scarves and signs.
“It’s amazing,” Wilson, a 1971 grad-
uate of UF, said. “I didn’t even realize how global it could be until I put this stuff on Etsy.”
Wilson’s creativity and love for the 
Gators became intertwined when she came to UF on a fine arts scholarship. In her time, she attended countless home football and basketball games, she said, and eventually graduated with a degree in interior design.
After years of being an interior de-
signer, and later a financial assistant, Wilson decided it was time to turn back to the things she loved most — crafting and UF.
“I love being creative, and I’m a life-
long Gator,” she said. “It just kicked me right in the pants that I need to start do-ing stuff I enjoy.”
After making enough products to 
expand, Wilson asked her son to make a website. Instead, he introduced her to Etsy.
He told her it was easy to set up and 
use Wilson said.  
He was right, and she has been us-
ing it to spread orange and blue all 
over the world.
“I’ve sent things to Kentucky, to Cal-
ifornia, to Japan,” Wilson said.
One of her products, a sign that says 
how many miles a particular place is from The Swamp, made it more than 
7,000 miles to Germany.
“Social media is a wonderful thing 
when you can just talk to someone in Germany, and it’s not going to cost you anything,” Wilson said.

If Mabelin Castellanos was to read 
her name on a page, certain letters would pop from the black and white of ink and paper. She would see the a’s in red, the e’s in green, the i’s in yellow and the o’s in white.
Castellanos has grapheme-color 
synesthesia. The part of her brain that processes words and numbers overlaps with the part of the brain that sees col-ors.
The condition is common among 
artists, Castellanos said, which would explain the large collection of mixed media art and household knickknacks in her Etsy collection, TelArtes.
“It’s a need I have,” she said. “It bal-
ances my mind.”
Castellanos is a scientist. After emi-
grating from Cuba in 1994, Castellanos came to work for UF’s department of physiological sciences at a time when the university was the only school in Florida with a medical college.
Castellanos believes art and science 
balance each other.
Much of her work is quilt art. She 
creates a graphic tablet on the computer to print onto fabric, then sews on top of it with different colors and patterns. The scenes are inspired by everyday life.
“That’s just what I love, people and 
ambiance,” she said.
For a while, Castellanos was part of 
the Artisans’ Guild Gallery , a co-op for Gainesville artists, she also put up tables and stands at art shows and farmers markets all around Florida. Those be-came too time-consuming, so she joined Etsy in February.
Since then, she’s sold two key chains 
and a quilt art piece.
“The money is not really an issue,” 
she said, “but you like to show what you do in a way.”
She also enjoys browsing.“Etsy’s great because you can see 
what other artists are doing,” she said. “It’s even better as a buyer.”
With her synesthesia and science-
heavy job, Castellanos doesn’t see art creation as a choice, but as a necessity. However, it is a welcome necessity.
“I have a need to see color and put 
it together,” she said. “I really enjoy do-ing it.”

“I love being creative, and 
I’m a lifelong Gator, and it just

� THE STORE IS GETTING EN-
ERGY EFFICIENT WINDOWS.   
SAMANTHA SOLUM
Avenue Writer
What began as a passion for Native 
American customs expanded into a 
boutique in 2008, and now the expan-sion continues in order to serve the community of Gainesville.
Otter and Trout Trading Co., locat-
ed at 625 W University Ave., recently added another room to its store to make space for the growing collection of herbs, books, gems and unusual gifts, but the renovations aren’t over.
Eric Dreaming Trout and Kimberli 
White Otter have teamed up with Trimark Properties to add energy ef-ficient windows and paneling as well as an entire new look for the store, all while keeping its doors open.
Otter said their main concern is 
networking with the community to create wellness on a global scale, but closing during construction would hinder these efforts.
“We want whatever the Gainesville 
people want,” Trout said.
Every Monday through Saturday, 
customers eagerly wait outside the door until it opens at 11 a.m. and con-tinue to come and browse or seek ho-listic advice until the store closes at 7 p.m.
Although the store is on University 
Avenue, its main customer base isn’t necessarily UF students.
Otter said they get all different 
walks of life visiting the store and most of them discover it through word-of-mouth or from curiosity of the trinkets they spot through the window.“I think we stay busy because 
people are realizing the importance of getting in touch with their ancient roots,” Otter said. “More people are interested in trying herbal remedies, opposed to chemical and pharmaceu-tical treatments.”
Otter gained her knowledge of 
herbs through a near-death experi-ence from a car accident in 1996.
“I came back with some gifts I 
couldn’t really explain,” she said. “I didn’t know how I knew what I knew but it just became intuitive to me.”
She met Trout in 1997, and they 
combined interests to create a busi-ness selling their herbal concoctions out of a tent at Native American pow-wows.
Trout noticed how many people 
turned to Otter with their ailments, and he encouraged her to open their own store.
Otter was already working as a 
certified masseuse in Gainesville and when the space became available, they decided it was where they were going to stay.
Now in the store’s fifth year of be-
ing open, the pair plan on continuing to grow, improve and contribute a portion of all profits to the vision of global healing.
Their goals for the future are to 
provide a self-sustaining, multicultur -
al, interspiritual center for alternative healing situated on ample property with lush foliage, live oaks and run-ning water, medicinal and meditation gardens, healing, drum circles, work-shops and nature walks.
The pair believe if they continue to 
serve the Gainesville community, then the customer support will help make this vision a reality. Otter and Trout Trading Co. offers holistic practices to Gainesville

In a room with only the noise of a buzz-
ing tattoo gun, conversations formulate 
out of thin air.
For Keri Johnson, a 27-year-old UF stu-
dent studying religion and nature, and 36-year-old tattoo artist “Sleepy Dave” Kotinsley, a discussion that started about a thesis paper grew into a community medi-tation group.
Kotinsley, who has been regularly med-
itating for a year and a half, mentioned that he had an instructor, but he lived out of town.  Johnson has been teaching yoga and meditating on her own for about eight years. The two discussed the importance of a community coming together for these types of practices.
Through this need grew their Free 
Community Meditation Group. The ﬁ  rst session was June 1, and there are sessions every Friday. The group is led by either Kotinsley or Johnson at 8:45 a.m. at Sanc-tuary Yoga, located in the Seigle building, 408 W University Ave., No. 112.
“The sessions last an hour, but it isn’t 
an hour of seated meditation,” Johnson said. “It starts with 15 minutes of breath-ing work and stretching, a half hour of seated practice and then we take a couple minutes at the end to check in, talk about the experience and see what worked and what didn’t.“Johnson and Kotinsley want to focus 
on and make it known that this is a non-denominational meditation group.“So it’s all religious afﬁ  liations and no 
religious afﬁ  liations,” Johnson said. “We welcome anyone of all levels of medita-tion. It’s really a community-oriented class, where we are learning from each other.”
The ﬁ  rst session the duo hosted had 15 
people — a number that they deem a very positive response. The studio can ﬁ  t about 40 people. Johnson and Kotinsley switch off hosting the group, but the schedule isn’t set in stone.
Hosting the meditation provides them 
with an outlet to share experiences.
“It’s easy to meditate on your own at 
home,” Kotinsley said. “It’s the human and community aspect that is very impor-tant, and it’s been great for me personally as well.”
Kotinsley said there is no end date 
planned for the future.
“We want to build something, hopeful-
ly something that the community wants to support for years to come,” he said.

 Last week, Brian Johnson was not 
thinking about life after Omaha.
  “You avoid it by you want to 
win a national championship,” he 
said last Tuesday . “The whole team has worked so hard, and you’ve got goals to accomplish before you have the next one.”
  Now, Johnson and eight of his 
teammates will likely move on to professional baseball. They leave Florida with three straight College World Series appearances, but no national championship.
  “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Preston 
Tucker said.
  Six days ago, the top-ranked 
Gators had just arrived in Omaha with the ultimate prize in sight. As the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, Florida had won ﬁ  ve straight games to sweep both the NCAA Regional and the Super Re-gional.
  However, the Gators’ demise in 
Omaha was surprisingly quick.
  Florida opened the College 
World Series against two-time de-fending national champion South Carolina on Saturday with Johnson on the mound. Johnson had a 2.40 ERA in two of the Gators’ three wins in four tries against the Gamecocks this season.
  But shutting down South Caroli-na for a third time proved too tall of an order for Johnson, who lasted just four-plus innings and surrendered ﬁ  ve earned runs in a 7-3 defeat.
  The Gamecocks’ offensive out-
burst occurred right after a mound visit from O’Sullivan. South Caro-lina had loaded the bases with no outs, but O’Sullivan decided to leave Johnson in the game.
  “We had a two-run lead,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Once again, you’ve just got to tip your cap. I thought they had some really good at-bats that inning, obviously.”
  Facing elimination against Kent 
State, Florida sent ace Hudson Ran-dall to the mound Monday. Howev-er, weather ﬁ  nally got the best of the Gators after a rain-plagued Super Regional victory against N.C. State.
  On-ﬁ  eld temperatures rose to 
104 degrees according to ESPN and forced UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan to pull an overheated Randall, and errors took care of the rest. Ran-dall and Jonathon Crawford, who pitched three innings of relief, gave up four combined unearned runs due to ﬁ  elding miscues.
  “We made a couple errors in the 
ﬁ  rst and second, and they capital-ized,” O’Sullivan said. “That was the difference in the ball game.”
  Errors, heat and a historic post-
season winning streak aside, the common thread in both Florida loss-es came down to untimely hitting. The Gators stranded 21 runners on  Florida coping with abrupt end to College World Series run

THE RALLY
 Joe: Rewind to January 1, 2012. The ball 
has dropped in New York City, and I’m drinking champagne out of a plastic wine 
glass. A fortune teller — decked out in purple robes with a crystal ball — saunters over and tells me the Gators will win three national championships in the ﬁ  rst six months of the year and that John Carter would be the box-
ofﬁ  ce bust of 2012. First, as the world’s big-gest Andrew Stanton fanboy, I would weep bitterly. Right after that, I would have trav-eled to Las Vegas and bet every dime in my pocket that Kevin O’Sullivan’s squad would win the 2012 Col-lege World Series. Fast-forward six months, and I’m glad my little anecdote is just a hypothetical. In easily the most disappointing development in UF sports this season, the top-ranked Gators baseball team was two-and-out in Omaha. Florida was the second team eliminated from the CWS this year despite losing just two starters and boasting an over-achieving freshman class. After three straight fruitless trips to Omaha, the biggest cham-pionship window 
in UF baseball history slammed shut with a resounding thud Monday.
Corey: Alright, the baseball team ﬂ  at out sucked in the CWS this year, but to say it was the most disappointing result this season — queue Chris Carter — “C’mon, man!” I know it’s hard to remember that one weekend back in May, but it took four games for the ﬁ  fth-seeded Gators softball team to be eliminated from the postseason. Not only did they fail to advance to the Women’s College World Se-ries for the ﬁ  rst time in ﬁ  ve years, but they couldn’t even win their NCAA Regional, a feat not seen in Gainesville since Chris Leak

 When junior Dwight Barbi-
asz ﬁ  rst started competing in 
the high jump in 2008, he had to spend that summer watching the Olympics from home. This year Barbiasz wants in. 
  “I saw all the commercials 
leading up to the 2008 Olympics, but I was a senior in high school then,” Barbiasz said. “I would say, ‘I’m going to make it to the next one,’ and that’s what I’ve 
been trying to do since then.”
  Over the 
next 11 days, 
Barbiasz and 14 current and for-mer Gators will be competing at the Olympic Trials for a spot on Team USA for the 2012 Olympic Games. This is the largest cham-pionship track meet in the world, with more than 1,000 athletes competing for 102 spots.
  Despite the large number of competitors, Barbiasz, who is coming off a win at the Southeast-ern Conference in triple jump and a record breaking performance at the NCAA Outdoor Champion-ships, is staying relaxed. 
 Barbiasz one of several Gators competing in U.S. Olympic trials

  “I don’t really get too 
nervous, but that deﬁ  nitely 
helps boost my conﬁ  dence going into the trials,” Bar-biasz said. “I deﬁ  nitely feel like I can jump even higher, so I’m hoping to get that Olympic ‘A’ Standard this weekend so hopefully I can make the team with that.”
  Over the last two months, 
Barbiasz has improved his mark from 2.05m/6-8.75 at Drake Relays to 2.28m/7-5.75 at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. After his performance in Des Moines, Iowa, his jump ranks him fourth in the country, and about two inches short of having the top mark. 
  “I think I’ll surprise some 
people because I’m kind of an underdog going into it from being injured a lot all year. But I had some good at-tempts at nationals this year, so I think I can get that mark and maybe even higher than that. If I do that, then I think I’ll have a good chance at making the team.”
  Out of the group of cur-
rent and former Gators com-peting, there are six athletes whose marks rank in the top-ﬁ  ve in their event — Will Claye (triple jump and long jump), Marquis Dendy (long jump), Tony McQuay (400 
m e t e r s ) , C h r i s t i a n Taylor (tri-ple jump), 
Omar Crad-dock (tri-ple jump) and Barbi-asz (high 
jump). 
  “I’m just excited to go 
out there, compete and po-tentially have the chance to make the team and represent the United States,” Barbi-asz said. “That’s been my ultimate goal since I started track. I’m just trying to make that dream come true.”

TRACK , from page 17Barbiaasz ranks 
fourth in the United States in high jump
Barbiasz 
was walking around campus. In 
the regional, consisting entirely of Sunshine State foes — teams Flor-ida has dominated over the past decade — Tim Walton’s squad be-came the ﬁ  rst Top-10 national seed eliminated from the tournament. To say the baseball team was the biggest disappointment this sea-son, we would have to overlook the softball team. And even Disney has to recognize John Carter bombed.
  Joe: Everybody knew John Cart-
er would be a bust just like they knew that even at full strength, this season’s Gators softball squad was not competing for a national cham-pionship. Granted, Florida fell to Arizona State in the WCWS ﬁ  nals in 2011, but that was a different team. Only ﬁ  ve players from the Gators’ starting lineup against the Sun Devils last June returned this year. And in the NCAA Regional, the ﬁ  ve returners were hampered. Cheyenne Coyle had already left the team, and Brittany Schutte had just returned to the lineup after re-covering from a broken jaw. The baseball team was deep and rea-sonably healthy after ﬁ  ve months of play. Sloppiness in the ﬁ  eld and untimely hitting sunk the baseball team. Inexperience and a lack of depth hurt the softball team. Each squad’s demise was disappointing, but the men got their butts kicked in embarrassing fashion.
Corey: So losing in an NCAA Re-
gional that you hosted isn’t embar-rasing? And oh yeah, they were the No. 5 national seed — that number is less than the amount of UF Alerts I got yesterday, but I digress. The rosters between this year’s and last year’s softball teams may be differ-ent, but the numbers aren’t. Both owned 21-7 SEC records, with last year’s squad putting up a slightly higher overall winning percent-age heading into the postseason, 84 percent compared to 81 percent. Hitting was down this season, but defense improved, offering the same ﬁ  elding percentage as last year (.974) and showing signiﬁ  cant improvement in opponent’s bat-ting average (.208 to .196) and team ERA (2.16 to 1.44). Now let’s look at the baseball team. Sure they were the top-ranked team in the NCAA Tournament, and should still be competing, but who did they lose to? Kent State would be a ﬂ  uke if you consider a team that knocked out three Top-15 squads on its way to the CWS a joke. Either way, it happens in baseball, especially in a one-game situation. South Carolina was the eighth national seed, work-ing off of a 21-game win streak in the tournament and two straight national championships. At least O’Sullivan took his team to the CWS to lose to quality opponents. The softball team, however, lost their ﬁ  rst game of the postseason to Florida Gulf Coast, found a way to make it to the regional ﬁ  nal and then put up a goose egg against USF. Great things weren’t expected of John Carter, but neither was los-
ing $200 million.
  Joe: I think this debate boils 
down to the big picture. Softball returns the majority of its roster next season, and each player will have gained valuable experience and learned from this season’s early playoff exit. Baseball will contend for a fourth straight trip to Omaha next season, but the road will be much tougher. The Gators had nine players drafted, including All-Americans Mike Zunino, Pres-ton Tucker and Brian Johnson. The national championship window for Florida baseball has closed for the time being barring an Oh-Fours-type run. The softball team has a deep pitching staff with Hannah Rogers, Lauren Haeger and Alyssa Bache. They will be just ﬁ  ne mov-ing forward. In fact, coach Tim Wal-ton’s squad should generate quite a bit of preseason buzz next season. Also, John Carter wasn’t that bad — 
a quality Redbox rental.
  Corey: Softball’s lone senior 
departure this season is Michelle Moultrie, who led the team in a modest eight categories — batting average (.386), total bases (116) and on-base percentage (.489) to name a few. That in itself is a big hit for the team. But just before the NCAA Regional, three players were sus-pended because of an alleged alter-cation and ultimately “they won’t play there anymore.” Kasey Fagan and Cheyenne Coyle, both two-year starters, brought a lot of expe-rience to the team. And 2011 Gato-rade Florida Softball Player of the Year, Sami Fagan, will not have the chance to follow up a solid season, in which she was second on the team with a .378 hitting clip. That’s four bats gone from next year’s lineup. Pitching might be alright in the future, but a lot of talent will be missed regardless. In other words, the sequel gives us nothing to look forward to, much to the dismay of John Carter fans.

Thompson receives medical 
redshirt, will return in 2013
base in Omaha, and they tallied just two 
runs in four bases-loaded opportunities.
“We’ve had plenty of opportunities 
and the other team has played better, it’s as simple as that,” O’Sullivan said. “I’m not going to point fingers at one thing or the other as why we lost.”
Moving on to next season, a depleted 
Florida roster will look to some of this season’s key underclassmen for leader -
ship and production.
Rising sophomores Casey Turgeon, 
Justin Shafer and Josh Tobias were all key cogs in the Gators’ lineup down the stretch this season. Taylor Gushue will attempt to fill the spikes of catcher Mike Zunino behind the plate.
Upcoming juniors Jonathon Crawford 
and Karsten Whitson will top a formida-ble starting rotation assuming Crawford builds on his late-season progress and Whitson pitches like he did during his freshman campaign in 2011.
UF also anticipates the return of se-
nior center fielder Tyler Thompson to the lineup in 2013. Thompson, who was bat-ting .319 through 16 games this season, received a medical redshirt after suffering an ACL tear in his right knee against Van-derbilt on March 16.
Regardless of what Florida accom-
plishes moving forward, the Gators’ crop of upperclassmen notched three consecu-tive College World Series appearances in arguably the most successful run in UF baseball history. Their feat will be in-scribed on the right-field wall next season 
at McKethan Sta-dium.
“They’ve set a 
standard that fol-lowing teams will 
have to live up to,” O’Sullivan said.
The last three years mark the best re-
sults achieved by any Florida baseball team. Despite their recent run, the Gators have yet to win a national title.
“It’s going to take a while to hit me,” 
Zunino said. “I’m sure it hit the other people.  But it’s disappointing at the time.  I’m sure it will hit harder later.”
