Not all books make the 
cut.
Some come soiled by cof-
fee. Some come ripped, torn 
and trashed.  
But those are tossed out, 
and only the best of the bunch remain when book lovers ﬂ  ood the warehouse to pick their wares.
Hundreds of thousands of 
donations will soon be on sale at the biannual Friends of the Library Book Sale. This week, volunteers will make the ﬁ  nal touches to the stands that stu-dents and families will scour for stories this weekend.
The book sale starts 9 a.m. Saturday at the Friends of the Library warehouse, 430-B N. Main St. The sale beneﬁ  ts the Alachua County Library Dis-trict.
About 150 volunteers 
spent six months prepar-ing for the sale. They sifted through titles, selecting only the well-kept items.
Last year, about 750 people 
entered the warehouse during the ﬁ  rst 30 minutes of the sale. A line stretched three blocks back from the front door.
“It’s a phenomenon,” said 
Sarah Harrison, 57, longtime Friends of the Library volun-teer and the organization’s publicity chair. “Gainesville is a small town.”
As volunteers set up for 
the sale, carts rolled on the Friends of the

Florida Democratic Sen. Bill 
Nelson, who is up for re-election 
Nov. 6, spoke to about 30 people Wednesday in the Reitz Union about the upcoming election.
Nelson, 70, said new election 
laws are suppressing students’ votes. He said that for decades, people could register to vote and then, on the day of the election, change their addresses. But now, people need to show a govern-ment-issued ID with their voting address, or they will be issued a provisional ballot.
He said that in the 2008 election, 
half of those provisional ballots did not count in Florida.
Nelson encouraged everyone to 
vote early. He said registered vot-ers in Alachua County can receive absentee ballots at the Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce. Instead of mail-ing them in, people can vote on-site and turn ballots in until Saturday.
He said early voting starts Sat-
urday and lasts for a week.Nelson, who attended UF in the 
1960s before transferring to Yale University, also spoke about stu-dent loans and the economy.
He said that coming out of the 
recession, students who have to pay back loans have their normal rates cut in half. He also said for certain high-demand occupations, student loans are basically forgiv-en, e.g., if a doctor moved to work in a rural area that didn’t have a doctor before.
Nelson said the state’s mental-
ity is to “cut, cut, cut” scholarships, grants and other funding for edu-cation.
“This nonsense has got to stop,”

Twelve-time Olympic medalist and UF 
class of 1990 alumna Dara Torres will emcee 
this year’s Gator Growl.
The show, which has a reputation for being the largest student-run pep rally in the world, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Nov. 9 in Ben Hill Grif-ﬁ  n Stadium. 
“Dara Torres is a superstar for this school 
and our country,” said Sean Lan, an 18-year-old biology freshman. “She’s going to make a great host for this year’s event.”The Olympic swimmer most recently won 
three silver medals in Beijing as a 41-year-old, according to a press release. During her time as a telecommunication student at UF, Tor-res won nine SEC individual championships, three NCAA championships and 28 all-Amer-ican honors.
Gator Growl publicity chairman Sean 
Quinn wrote in an email that he was not aware of any information regarding Torres’ compen-sation for emceeing the event.“We think Dara’s a great ﬁ  t for the event, be-
cause she embodies the Gator Nation,” Quinn said. “She not only represented the University of Florida admirably but also the United States admirably with her triumphs both inside and outside of the pool.”
The show will also feature country singer 
Josh Turner and comedian Tracy Morgan. Tickets for the event are $15 for students, $20 for UF faculty and staff and $25 for alumni and guests.

UF students sang, danced, 
juggled and rapped at Gator 
Growl’s Talent Night at the Re-itz Union Grand Ballroom on Wednesday.
The performers showcased 
their Gator pride and American patriotism in accordance with the Homecoming theme, “Unit-ed We Growl.”
Organizers raised $530 
Wednesday and about $1,000 total, said Talent Night director Lauren Herstik, a 21-year-old advertising junior. The Wound-ed Warrior Project will receive 50 percent of the proceeds.
Fifth-year English student Kimberly Percuoco, 22, won the National Anthem competi-tion, which means she’ll open Gator Growl with her rendition of the “The Star-Spangled Ban-ner” Nov. 9. Danza and The Se-doctaves will also perform that night onstage at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Talent Night added a Nation-
al Anthem face-off to its compe-tition for the first time this year. The crowd stood as Girl Scout Troupe 1029, Caira Danielle Everly and Kimberly Percuoco each sang Wednesday.
After, 14 individual contes-
tants and groups competed in the music and dance categories.
Erica Mason rapped fast and 
bounced around stage in high heels. David Ferman juggled various items — including six balls, five pins and five knives — at different times while riding a unicycle. Sabor Latino danc-ers flashed in red and yellow costumes as they performed to Ne-Yo and Beyoncé songs and salsa music, at one point flood-ing into the aisles.
Gator Growl will not be the 
first time Percuoco performs the country’s anthem in a sport sta-dium. 
Percuoco has performed at 
Marlins games for seven years.
But Wednesday night, Perc-
uoco said, she stopped breathing when her name was announced as the National Anthem win-ner.
Her mom, who drove four 
hours from Jupiter to watch her perform, ran in front of the stage to take photos of Percuoco accepting her trophy.
Although she’s not anxious 
about performing in a stadium packed with about 20,000 fans, she said “I’m going to be ner -
vous when I see Josh Turner.”
Students dance, sing, juggle at Gator Growl’s Talent Night
Nelson said the first step toward policy change is voting on Nov. 6
he told the crowd.
Jenna Goldman, a 19-year-old political 
science sophomore, interned with Nelson’s 
office in Washington, D.C., this summer. Wednesday, she asked him how to reach across party lines and bring people together.
“We change policy by balance instead of bullets,” Nelson said.
He said the first step in doing so is the 
Nov. 6 election. He said he believes the American people are tired of political party divisions, and only pressure from constitu-ents will lead to changes in Congress.
“We have to use common sense,” he said.UF College Democrats President Billy Far -
rell said Gainesville was a stop on Nelson’s barnstorming tour through Florida.
“We wanted to help or -
ganize the event on behalf of his campaign,” said the 20-year-old environmental 
science junior.
UF Student Govern-
ment Senator Brandon Laines said he thought the event was a great way for students to understand Nelson’s views.
“I do have an interest in public service, 
and Bill Nelson is a good testament of work-ing for the people,” said the 19-year-old eco-nomics and mathematics sophomore.

The average price of 
books is 25 cents to $4
concrete, clanking on the cracks 
in the floor as they carried dona-tions from people throughout Gainesville to each genre’s tables.
Thick medicine textbooks sat 
on shelves near neighboring fic-tion paperbacks. CDs and VHS tapes lined the back walls, hold-ing tunes and tapes once owned by locals.
The sale is the largest of its kind 
in Florida, Harrison said, and it at-tracts people from throughout the country.
Ron Beauschamp, 61, packed 
a small suitcase and drove nine hours from Durham, N.C., to vol-unteer this weekend. He lived in Gainesville for two years before he moved north, and this Satur -
day will mark his ninth sale.
“The amount of work that goes 
into this is just amazing for the results,” Beauschamp said. “I’ve been to tons of book sales, and nothing compares to this.”
Retired professors and profes-
sionals organized each category of items available at the event. Mag-azines laid on tables, their covers capturing moments in history. Posters and original oil paintings were priced and arranged. Cook-books and craft books waited for families to flip through their worn pages.
Harrison said collectors come 
in flocks the first day, snatching up hidden gems for less than half of what they’re worth.
Though the sale volunteers ap-
preciate the collectors’ business, they haven’t lost sight of what the book sale means for the commu-nity.
“Shucks, we exist for the people 
of Gainesville,” said Peter Roode, 72, president of the local Friends of the Library chapter. “Our crafty ladies stash a few copies for the Sunday and Monday kids.”
The sale lasts five days and 
runs Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday and Tuesday from noon to 7 p.m. and Wednesday from noon to 6 p.m.
The average price is between 
25 cents and $4. On Wednesday, remaining titles will be sold for 10 cents. Remaining items will be available for charity.book , from page 1

Students looking for a good 
scare don’t have to travel far.
Several UF residence halls 
will host free Halloween-themed 
events from tonight until Nov. 2, said Inter-Residence Hall Associa-tion president Severin Walstad.
Walstad said the largest event is 
Haunted Broward, which will take place in the Broward basement to-night from 8 p.m. to midnight.
Hannah Pohlmann, a 20-year-
old mathematics junior and Rawl-ings RA, is in charge of the Bro-ward event’s set up.
She said a team of 20 volunteers 
helped set up walls for the haunted house’s maze Wednesday in the basement. The haunted house’s trail weaves for about 300 yards.
“For being put on by amateurs, 
this is a pretty good haunted house,” she said.
At 7 p.m. Friday, the Yulee area 
will host a carnival event. It will of-fer activities like a costume contest, games like cornhole and fishing for prizes, a booth with a palm reader and an inflatable obstacle course, said president of Yulee area’s coun-cil Kathryn Kerr.
The 20-year-old psychology 
sophomore said the carnival is more fall-focused than Halloween-themed, though.
“It’s a lot of work, and I’m really 
nervous for it,” she said. “But the most fun part will probably be see-ing people on the obstacle course.”
Hume Hall will host its public 
haunted house 8 p.m.Tuesday. At 5 p.m., the hall will open exclu-sively to members from the Boys & Girls Club and other younger chil-dren, said Adrian Basler, president of Student Honors Organization, which oversees the event.
Haunted Hume organizers ask 
for a $2 donation. Last year, the money went to UNICEF, Basler said. This year, the proceeds will likely go to the organization’s Dance Marathon team.
Themes are selected by floor. 
Eight of Hume’s 10 floors will host haunted houses. 
Basler said past themes include 
“insane asylum gone wrong” and “Alice in Wonderland.”
Basler, a 19-year-old mechanical 
and aerospace engineering sopho-more, said he’s interested to see what each floor comes up with.
“I get to judge it this year, which 
I’m pretty excited about,” he said. “I’m excited to see what the floors are doing.”Spooks come out on

It wouldn’t be a hectic political season if it weren’t for the in-
cessant windbags who come out of the woodwork to stir up trouble.
Ahh, Ann Coulter. Like many people, she took to Twitter after the presidential 
debate ﬁ  nished to shoot out a tweet that documented exactly how she felt.
While some declared President Obama “won” the debate, 
Coulter felt a little differently . Her tweet reads: “I highly approve of Romney’s decision to be kind and gentle to the retard.”
She still hasn’t deleted that message or apologized for it, by 
the way , which a normal public ﬁ  gure might do. We shouldn’t be surprised when Coulter is insensitive about a subject or topic, but here we are. It doesn’t mean that everyone is OK with it.
John Franklin Stephens, an athlete and spokesman for the 
Special Olympics, wrote her an open letter.
“I’m a 30-year-old man with Down syndrome who has strug-
gled with the public’s perception that an intellectual disability means that I am dumb and shallow,” Stephens wrote. “I am not either of those things, but I do process information more slowly than the rest of you.  In fact, it has taken me all day to ﬁ  gure out how to respond to your use of the R-word last night.”
The letter continues: “I wondered if you meant to degrade 
him as someone who is likely to receive bad health care, live in low-grade housing with very little income and still manages to see life as a wonderful gift. Because, Ms. Coulter, that is who we are — and much, much more.”
Her representation team should scramble. It’s like she can’t 
stop insulting people. She hasn’t contacted Stephens, according to his interview with ABC News, but he invited her to the next Special Olympics in his letter.
He all but dared her to “walk away with your heart un-
changed.”
Don’t get your hopes up, Stephens. Coulter replied to a re-
quest from Politicker, at 3 a.m. Wednesday no less, for a com-ment or response to critics of her offensive tweet.
“The only people who will be offended are too retarded to 
understand it,” she wrote.
That word doesn’t mean what she thinks it means.Let’s deﬁ  ne “understand,” shall we? It is to “perceive the in-
tended meaning of (words, a language or speaker)” or to “per-ceive the signiﬁ  cance, explanation or cause of (something).”
The entire world understood your intended meaning, 
Coulter. But maybe we don’t understand the cause of it.
There is no need to continue to insult anyone with the use of 
names or hateful words. What we don’t understand is why you feed the impulse to keep placing your foot in your mouth.
Apologize, and stop doing hateful things. It’s really not that 
difﬁ  cult.
Kudos to Stephens for being the much better person in this 
scenario.

Look outside! Leaves changed color and fell from 
trees. The weather is cooler with every passing day. 
Enjoying time outside is possible, which is often 
hard with Gainesville’s average temperature for the year being about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The few weeks of au-tumn that Florida has slip by. As the days grow shorter, there is no time to enjoy them.
Since Labor Day, which was Sept. 3 this year, stu-
dents have been hard at work without holidays from 
class. Our weeks, ﬁ  lled with ﬁ  ve days of lectures and discussion groups, became crammed with countless hours of studying.
Halfway through the week, we’re left feeling ex-
hausted and stressed.
Unlike Florida schools, many northern colleges and 
universities grant students a week off after midterms during the Fall semester. This is a time for many stu-dents, who may have not seen family since the end of summer, to return home.
For others, it can be a chance to apply for a Fall se-
mester internship or exciting volunteer opportunity. Regardless, everyone could beneﬁ  t from a few days without the stress of school.
An extended weekend or a week off seems too good 
to be true when homework and notes are piled high. In the midst of midsemester exams, there is no relief from the workload or time to feel good about what they al-ready accomplished.
Weekends were created to improve efﬁ  ciency.With two days off, we can balance a busy week, and 
there is time for rejuvenation. This may be enough in the working world where jobs have speciﬁ  c hours. But being a student is an everyday job that consumes free time. It may be the equivalent to working overtime. We balance full course loads and countless other outside activities. Social events and nonacademic work take up a large bulk of time throughout the week. Even when we are on break, many students shift their focus from academ-ics to paying jobs or extensive career research until classes re-sume.
The addition of a fall break 
in the semester would increase student productivity drasti-cally.
After a week away from 
campus, there is a new, stronger desire to succeed and push through the remaining weeks until winter break. A different outlook, which could be the result of an aca-demic break, may result in better grades and studying habits for the remainder of the semester.
Now, students have to survive ﬁ  nals before they can 
taste freedom from their academics. Efﬁ  ciency is plum-meting as the days wear on and will continue to do so as the days get cooler.
At all other points of the year, there are no extended 
periods without days off classes. Winter break marks the end of Fall semester and the beginning of Spring. Spring Break is a great relief, but there is nothing that resembles it during the long months between August and Thanksgiving.
Without opportunities to take a break, it’s far easier 
to feel exhausted and stressed from normal day-to-day activities.
Weekends are ﬁ  lled with football, but there are only 
so many hours we can give for our love of the Gators before we need to hit the books.  
Good studying habits got each of us into this uni-
versity, and to survive here, we need time to keep them up.

On Oct. 18, the Second U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals ruled the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. 
What does that mean, and how does it af-
fect us?
Recently, a woman named Edith Wind-
sor was required by the federal govern-ment to pay a whopping estate tax of about $363,000 on her inheritance from her partner.
The government of New York recog-
nized Windsor and her partner of about 42 years as spouses, but the federal govern-ment treated them like strangers.
The inheritance would not have in-
curred an estate tax had the federal gov-ernment recognized their partnership. The federal government failed to recognize the marriage because of the Defense of Mar-riage Act, or DOMA.
DOMA was enacted by Congress in 
1996. 
This act deﬁ  nes marriage as “a legal 
union between one man and one woman as husband and wife.”
Windsor took the issue to court, and 
she won. More than that, DOMA was declared 
unconstitutional. This is a great victory for those in favor of gay marriage.
However, I wonder how this act passed 
in the ﬁ  rst place.
To be very clear, I’m not talking about 
the religious ceremony of marriage that takes place in a church. That’s a different kind of marriage.
I’m talking about the legal designation 
— think of it as a driver’s license.
In a free society, the state has no busi-
ness conducting religious ceremonies. As written in the majority opinion of Wind-sor v. United States, “law is not concerned with holy matrimony.”
As a gay man, I am frequently exposed 
to vitriol about partaking in the civil insti-tution of marriage. 
I pay taxes just like everyone else.Why should I be denied entry into an 
institution offered by the state on the basis of my gender, sex or orientation?
The replies often sound something like, 
“God doesn’t like it, so we shouldn’t allow it.”
The problem I see with this answer is that in a free so-ciety, in a secular state, what the god or gods of any group of people want is irrelevant.
That should 
sound appropriate to most people. 
That means we 
are all free to practice whatever faith we want, or to practice no faith at all, and still be treated equally under the law.
Another argument I’ve heard has to do 
with ability to give birth. 
But why should childbirth have any-
thing to do with marriage? Marriage un-der the state has to do with the civil union of two persons. Even DOMA lacks any mention of children.
The most heinous argument I’ve heard 
is that gay marriage will lead to other things like marriage between people and animals. I don’t understand how such a conclusion can be drawn. 
How could opening a state institution 
to all pairs of consenting adults lead to anything like that?
As I see it, there is no good reason to bar 
gay people from getting married under the law.
For many, it’s simply a problem with the 
word “marriage.” Maybe the state should offer “civil union” to all, rather than “mar-riage.”
To be honest, though, I don’t think gay 
marriage should be the great moral debate of our time. 
For anyone who is truly interested in 
freedom, the greater question we ought to ask is about the role of the state in gen-eral.
The state offers us incentives to get 
married by offering many beneﬁ  ts and privileges. 
How often should the state offer incen-
tives to curb the behavior of the nonvio-lent populace?
The state also offers disincentives, like 
raising taxes on cigarettes. Should the state engage in such social engineering at all?

◗ THE FARMERS MARKET 
WILL BE ON THE NORTH LAWN.
BRUNA BOUHID
Alligator Contributing Writer
Products such as pumpkins, 
soap and salsa will be sold on the 
North Lawn from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today as part of an on-campus farm-ers market. 
About 20 vendors and five stu-
dent organizations — including Bubbles Bailey Soap & Stuff, Vito’s Coffee, Little Bitt Nursery and the Flour Pot Bakery — will set up un-der tents and along the sidewalk, said UF Inter-Residence Hall Asso-ciation farmers market director Beth Thompson.
The farmers market is part of 
Eco-Week, hosted by IRHA and UF’s Office of Sustainability. The or -
ganizations want to encourage stu-dents to live sustainably, and part of that lifestyle is buying local.
Thompson said she hopes the 
event will allow students to see how simple meal-planning with fresh in-gredients can be.
“When you’re a student, you’re 
only cooking for yourself,” the 19-year-old marketing sophomore said. “The quantity is smaller at a farmers market and cheaper than eating out.”
IRHA put on a similar market in 
Spring where about 1,000 students stopped by, Thompson estimated. The success of today’s event will de-termine whether IRHA can reach its goal of sponsoring two to three mar -
kets a semester, Thompson said.
“We want to allow students to 
celebrate local agriculture,” she said.
Many of the familiar vendors 
from the Union Street Market will be on campus today, including Crazy Hart Ranch, Cross Creek Honey and Bear Bottom Boyz Salsa, Thompson said.Market on campus today

For Ryan Mychal-Brooks 
Burney, a nearly $12,000 pur -
chase with stolen credit card 
information he bought for $500 seemed like a steal.
But the deal soured when 
Gainesville Police arrested Burney, 30, of Northwest 57th Place, on felony grand theft and fraud charges Tuesday af-ternoon.
On Oct. 18, Burney went to 
the Palm Chevrolet dealership, 2600 N. Main St., and negoti-ated with a salesperson to buy a 2004 Lincoln Town Car for $11,995.
Burney drove away with 
the car after making two $500 down payments with a stolen card number, which he told the salesperson was his sister’s. 
He previously bought the 
information from someone in Atlanta for $500 cash, accord-ing to a GPD arrest report. 
About 130 miles south of 
Gainesville, Lisa Butchee fin-ished working a 10-hour shift Saturday afternoon when she found her car had a flat tire.
She tried to pay the $23 
for her tire repair bill, but her debit card was de-clined.
On Mon-
day, Butchee, 
51, of Lake Alfred, went to the Mid-
Florida Community Credit Union and saw her bank ac-count overdrafted by almost $1,000.
“I kind of assumed it was 
the bank’s mistake and they had moved a decimal point,” she said Wednesday. “I was a little mad about it.”After being advised by a 
bank teller of possible fraud, Butchee reported the loss to the Winter Haven Police De-partment, which then called Gainesville Police.
GPD spokesman Ben To-
bias said GPD officers went to the dealership Tuesday, sifted through records and found Burney’s fraudulent down payments on the car.
A dealership employee 
called Burney to tell him the car needed a GPS installed.
When Burney drove back 
to the dealership, GPD officers arrested him, and employees recovered the car, Tobias said.
After his arrest, Burney told 
officers he did not know the debit card information was stolen, according to the report.
Police booked Burney into 
Alachua County Jail at about 4:40 p.m. Tuesday.
As of Wednesday night, he 
remained in jail on a $30,000 bond.

� TEENAGE CHOPSHOP’S ALBUM “EVIL 
TWIN” WILL BE RECORDED WITH FUNDS FROM KICKSTARTER.
MIKE LLERENA
Avenue Writer
Time is running out for local indie-rock band 
Teenage Chopshop. The group has until the clock 
strikes midnight Oct. 31 to raise funds for its musi-cal fairytale.
The band is funding its second album “Evil 
Twin” through a campaign on Kickstarter.     
Kickstarter is a fundraising website for creative 
projects. Launched in April 2009, the platform al-lows people to contribute money to campaigns of their choice.
Frontman and manager Charlie Fehrenbacher 
said Teenage Chopshop launched its Kickstarter campaign Sept. 27, including a brief promotional video that explains what the band will do with its funds and how it plans to give back to its fans and investors.
“I had all of these songs written and knew I 
wanted to put out a new album,” Fehrenbacher said. “It was becoming crystal clear how it was go-ing to turn out and what the songs were going to be like. It was at that point that I said this would be really good for a Kickstarter project.”
According to Kickstarter policy, if the band does 
not reach its $3,200 goal, it must forfeit all accumu-lated funds. The money will buy microphones, edit-ing equipment, record-pressing materials, T-shirts and posters, Fehrenbacher said.
While the band members recognize they might 
not reach their goal, Fehrenbacher said they will still produce and release their album.
According to www.kickstarter.com, more than  $350 million has been pledged by more than 2.5 mil-lion people, funding over 30,000 creative projects.
Fehrenbacher and keyboardist/vocalist Ashley 
Phillips founded the band in 2011.  Guitarist Tanner Yea, a 20-year-old UF journalism junior; drummer Aidan Murphy , a 20-year-old UF physics junior; and bassist Clinton Martz, a 19-year-old Gainesville resident, were recruited through a Craigslist post.
“It’s really about getting our name out there and 
giving people a taste of what we do,” Fehrenbacher said. “And the fact that we’re doing every single thing we do at home by hand — we don’t want to rely on a record company, or a producer, or an image consultant or a manager. As far as I’m con-cerned, we’re smart enough and talented enough that we can do all of that stuff on our own.”
Brandon Nall is an artist and graphic designer 
who provided the artwork for the band’s website. Nall, 21, who attends the University of North Flor -
ida in Jacksonville, went to high school and played in a band with Yea previously.
“A community that can support its artists is very 
important and definitely appreciated by the artists,” Nall said. “If there are people that enjoy what you have to give, that’s awesome.”
Fehrenbacher said Kickstarter is a great way to 
let the community get involved in the music.
“I read articles from music bloggers saying 
they’re worried that the independent music scene is going to fail over time,” Fehrenbacher said. “What’s going to keep the music scene alive are the people still out there that care enough to work hard.”  
The band will host a CD release show for “Evil 
Twin” Dec. 8 at The Atlantic.
As of Wednesday night, Teenage Chopshop ac-
cumulated $600 and 14 backers on their Kickstarter profile. For more information about how to donate to the band’s campaign, visit www.teenagechop-shop.com.Local band asks Web to fund album

Forget spending way too much money on way 
too little fabric for a sexy-something Halloween 
costume. Instead, use materials you most likely have around the house for these ultra-creative pop culture costume ideas.
Ryan Lochte
If you want to look like a 101 Cantina staple, 
you’ll need: a Speedo, black eyeliner and alumi-num foil.    
1.     Put on your favorite Speedo. The more 
obnoxious the print, the better.
2.     If you aren’t blessed with Ryan Lochte-
level abs, create your own with black eyeliner. No one will know the difference.
3.     Rip a small strip of aluminum foil off 
your nearest roll, and place it on your teeth for Lochte’s fashion-forward grill.
4.     Smile like the UF alumnus and Olympian 
you are!“Fifty Shades of Grey”
If you want to look like housewives’ favor -
ite erotic novel, you’ll need: a copious amount of gray clothing and accessories and silver eye makeup.
1.     Pile on all the gray you own — hat, shirt, 
shoes, socks, jacket, etc.
2.     If you are feeling par -
ticularly festive, put some sil-ver eyeshadow and eyeliner for additional shades of gray. (We’re going for 50 here, peo-ple.)
“Binders full of women”
If you want to look like the 
Internet’s favorite presidential debate punch line, you’ll need: a magazine, scissors, three sil-ver bracelets and tape
1.     Dress up in one basic color. Black is pref-
erable, because most likely, the binder was not neon pink.
2.     Cut out all the women featured in the magazine of your choice and tape them all over your outfit.
3.     Put a bracelet on your wrist, elbow and 
bicep to create the three rings of your binder.
“Honey Boo Boo” Child
If you want to look like a “beautimous” red-
neck, you’ll need: a formal dress, makeup, toilet paper, a stapler and a bottle of Mountain Dew.
1.     Put on your formal dress and plaster your 
face with an amount of makeup that makes you almost unrecognizable.
2.     If Alana can celebrate her parents’ an-
niversary with toilet paper, it’s only fair that you celebrate Halloween with some. Create a beauty pageant sash out of toilet paper, and staple the bottom together. Feel free to write the label of your choice on it. Bonus points if you have a ti-ara and a toy pig lying around.
3.     Label your bottle of Mountain Dew as 
“Go-Go Juice.”

In the first week of November of last 
year, I kissed an owl. She was not an 
owl when I kissed her, though she was when I met her, and, at that point, I’d still thought of her as a reflection of the costume she wore.
We stood at her front door after a date 
and made clumsy conversation. After a while, I assumed she was buying time, so I leaned in and kissed her. I’d made a horrible mistake. It was uncomfortable for both of us.
After pulling away , I thought what 
any rational person would think: I should go. 
However, considering I can never 
connect my brain with the lower half of my body , I awkwardly announced, “I’m coming in again.” Before I knew it, we were kissing a second time. And yes, it was much worse the second time.
If you couldn’t already tell, this is a 
cautionary tale. They say that, in spring, love is in the air. But if you think about it, it makes more sense for cooler weather to bring people together.
You can hold hands without sweaty 
palms, there’s pumpkin-flavored every-thing and sharing your bed becomes an enjoyable prospect. 
The temporal nature of the season 
prompts a certain self-reflection — with the exception of Halloween, when you only want to be invited to a party so you can show off your tandem costume or some other extension of how stupefy-ingly clever you are. Let’s face it, this would be an exhausting endeavor if you were to try to emulate said cleverness for Halloween horror date: a 
tale of costumed deceitSPEAKING OUT
� PARTICIPANTS ILLUSTRATE A 24-
PAGE COMIC IN 24 HOURS.
KATHRYN VARN
Avenue Writer
Just after 10 p.m. Saturday, Eric Taylor 
was penciling his tenth page, working his 
way through a Rockstar energy drink.
He sat at a table at the Sequential Artists 
Workshop in downtown Gainesville, scat-tered with ink pens, pencils, mechanical erasers, a Big Lou’s Pizza menu and pages of hand-drawn comics.
Taylor and 12 other artists were in their 
12th hour of 24-Hour Comics Day, an inter -
national event which challenges artists to draw a 24-page comic in 24 hours.
A finished comic serves as a “cartoon-
ist’s merit badge,” Taylor said, who brought along a bag full of 24-hour comics from his five previous participations.
Some of the finished comics from this 
year’s local participants will be displayed Friday at the Workshop during Art Walk Gainesville.
The event was started by cartoonist Scott 
McCloud in 1990 as part of a dare with a friend, according to the event’s website. There are seven participating locations in Florida this year and more individual par -
ticipants.
Taylor’s comic, featuring Jon Arbuckle 
from “Garfield,” is about a serial killer. Ar -
buckle was still alive by page 10.
Across from Taylor, Adrian Pijoan, 23, 
was drawing the 16th page of a comic about a cat who, fueled by a sense of complacency on land, goes on a submarine adventure. He usually draws nonfiction comics but tried something new for his first 24-Hour Comic Day.
Pijoan and Taylor are students in Se-
quential Artists Workshop’s year-long comic-drawing class, which has seven stu-dents this year.

The leaves are still vibrantly 
green and T-shirts are still more 
than sufficient, but even in Florida, we crave fall flavor in the form of pumpkin.
The adaptability of pumpkin is 
unmatched. When seasoned with herbs, like rosemary or thyme, it can take on a savory identity, add-ing either a subtle note or becom-ing a commanding ingredient in a dish.  When combined with cinna-mon, nutmeg or cloves, pumpkin becomes a spiced seduction to any sweets lover.  
In Gainesville, pumpkin love is 
widespread, and local restaurants have willingly answered the de-mand.
For breakfast, try a stack of fluffy 
pumpkin pancakes from The Fly-ing Biscuit Cafe. Snack time means a quick trip to Mochi Frozen Yogurt for its limited fall flavor — pump-kin spice. Try top-ping a heaping cup with graham cracker crumbs, chocolate chips or cheesecake bites.
For dinner, Bonefish Grill offers 
a wood-grilled Atlantic Swordfish special,served over pumpkin ravi-oli and topped with feta, crispy sage and shallot brown butter. Also, try to catch the Civilization Pumpkin Lasagna dinner special made with a creamy ricotta and pumpkin puree mixture between delicate house- made pasta sheets.
Dessert leaves two options — 
baked or frozen.  For a unique baked dessert, try Karma Cream’s Pump-kin Spice D’ohNuts with cinnamon glaze, which are completely vegan and named in honor of Homer Simpson.  For a frozen fall-flavored finish, Sweet Dreams of Gainesville is churning out its nostalgic home-made pumpkin pie ice cream.
If you’re not pumpkin-ed out at this point, head to Swamp Head Brewery, where they serve a limited release of pumpkin beer starting Oct. 31. The beer will be tapped out of an actual pumpkin!
There is infinitely more to pump-
kin than a spiced latte from Star -
bucks. Gainesville chefs are creative-ly using the beloved bright orange vegetable in countless delicious and intriguing ways.
The only way to truly applaud 
their autumn spirit is to try these pumpkin dishes for yourself. Pump-kin’s only major flaw is that it lasts a limited time, so get it while you can.
Chomp and Chew: Gainesville restaurants embrace pumpkin 
fall’s favorite flavor is in seasonan extended period of time.
That brings me to this warning: Never 
date someone you meet on Halloween.
Now, I’m sure you’re wondering, “But 
Ian, what if I meet the boy or girl of my 
dreams?” To which I say , “If your dreams consist of romantic relationships with peo-ple dressed as animals, cartoon characters or the human centipede, you should see a therapist.”
If you meet someone dressed as a zom-
bie, he or she is probably lacking brains or creativity — let’s face it, zombie costumes are over. It’s beaten to death, everybody . We get it.
If you meet a guy dressed in a loin-
cloth, odds are he’s reliably troglodytic. If you meet a girl with more cleavage than a pumpkin patch, odds are that’s how she’ll dress to meet your mom.
Dressed like a German barmaid? One 
too many shots of Jagermeister, and she could probably bench press you. Dressed like a porn star? He probably has herpes.
A cat or dog costume? She’s probably high maintenance. Or he. Shout out to my men who love men and my ladies who love ladies. Don’t think this warning is het-eronormative; we’re all in danger of a bad Halloween date.
If a nightmare of a time is what you’re 
looking for, trust me, you’re better off meet-ing someone on Craigslist.
Where my own date was concerned, she 
was an owl. In our culture, this signifies wisdom with an air of mystery. I was a con-struction worker — the personification of hard work, ruggedness and dependability; although, in reality , I just found a hardhat and a flannel shirt.
The owl was not mysterious or sym-
bolic of anything, just nice, plain and a lit-tle mousy . I was not reliable or rugged or handsome, but rather bookish and aloof.
Even in the best scenario, if your date 
isn’t the costume he or she embodied, he or she is actually the polar opposite.
If you want my advice, go to a Hallow-
een party dressed as yourself, and wait for someone to ask you, “What are you sup-posed to be?” When they do, smile and say , “Me? I’m superficial.”12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25, 2012

At a desk scattered with peanuts and 
protein bars, the youngest participant, 
18-year-old Kyana Mitchell, worked on her comic about bored children who discover a mutated squid mon-ster in their basement. The only time she’s finished a comic was 
at a 24-hour comic sleepover she had with her friends last year.
“The only time I can finish is on a 
deadline,” she said.
Upstairs, UF digital arts and sciences 
sophomore Taylor Gregory was packing up his drawing tools.
Gregory, 19, started the Sequential 
Artists club at UF and has taken a few SAW classes to maintain his love of com-ics outside of school.
“It’s something I want to do,” he said, 
“but it’s not my major.”
Four Cokes and 12 hours later, Greg-
ory finished his comic when some par -
ticipants were not halfway through their comics. His hand was cramping too much to continue, he said, an issue many other artists faced as well.
In fact, Pijoan keeps a yoga mat next 
to his drawing desk at home to combat back and wrist cramps.
“It seems silly, but it’s strenuous,” he 
said.
One of the teachers in the program 
and owner of the workshop, Tom Hart, popped in at about 11 p.m. He’s partici-pated in 24-Hour Comics Days as a stu-dent and teacher.

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Dear Mediocre Advice,
Whenever I have a wild night, I end the eve-
ning with a drunken text. Usually, I am remind-ed of my decision in the morning when I wake up in that person’s bed. But on unsuccessful nights, all I’m left with are embarrassing text messages. Is being a promiscuous drunk  something I need to apologize for the next day 
if I’m rejected?

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Why do some women say they need an emotional connection to give a man a blow job and would 
instead be more willing to have sex (penetration)? If sexy time is sexy time, then why would certain 
activities be off the table? (I did the sexy time thing on purpose, because I know you don’t like it.)
Dear Questionable Person,
Sexy time makes you sound like you can’t speak proper English or you have suffered from a severe blow to the head — no pun intended. Certain activities are off the table, because one of the people involved in this dirty courtship is not comfortable. BJs are more personal than sexual intercourse. It’s putting someone’s junk in your mouth and hoping that when you recite the alphabet in your head, you only need to make it to Z once. Also, that person is counting on the other’s hygiene to be impeccable, which is a giant leap of faith. For something that personal, energy-consuming and literally in-your-face, the giver has to really like the receiver to volunteer to give a BJ. This is not the case in most sexual encounters. Dear Friend,
There is nothing wrong with buying condoms. In fact, cashiers should thank the person buying condoms, because that person is a responsible individual. The last time I bought some, the nice Indian man at Walgreens smiled at me. I’m sure it was for different reasons, but it definitely shouldn’t be frowned upon. You deserve a high-five for dealing with someone who won’t buy condoms but will still participate in using them. It’s common courtesy to at least offer to buy them. Your boyfriend needs to grow up, because sex isn’t something to be ashamed of, and both parties should al-ways be prepared. Ask him if he’d rather be the guy buying condoms or diapers. 
 Dear Mediocre Advice,
My friend wants to get a neck tattoo. How can I persuade her to not do that?
Dear Friend,
Remind your friend it will be difficult to get hired with a tattoo in such a noticeable place. Try somewhere that is easier to cover up, like behind the ear or the upper back. Maybe your friend can bring back tramp stamps instead. Something small on the back of the neck is alright, too, but whatever it is will still make her mother cry when she finally sees it during the holidays. Does she want her mother to drink a little more on Thanksgiving because she feels like she has failed her? Tell her to prepare herself for the “you need to find God” lecture and a mom who will rue the day she ever let her leave for college.
Dear Friend,
Don’t apologize! Stand by those weird drunken texts you send. Excessive drinking leads to tell-ing the truth, which you send via text. So why would you want to apologize for that? Unless you were insulting your best friend or someone you have feelings for, don’t worry about it. Drunken texts are the greeting cards of 2012. Yours says, “I’m thinking about you when I’m drunk,” and on the inside, it reads “So, let’s have sex.”Dear Mediocre Advice,

�FLORIDA HAS FORCED EIGHT 
FUMBLES THIS SEASON.
 ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer
   
 No opponent wants to be on the 
list.
  Before each game, Florida defen-
sive coordinator Dan Quinn identi-
ﬁ  es two to four “violators,” opposing players who don’t carry the football correctly. 
  Before Saturday’s game, corner-
back Loucheiz Purifoy made sure South Carolina receiver Ace Sanders knew he made the cut.
  “I was like ‘You better hold it 
tight,’” Purifoy said. “‘You’re going to be a violator today.’”
  Purifoy’s trash talk came to fruition 
in the second quarter, when Trey Bur-ton stripped Sanders during a punt re-turn and recovered the fumble.
  Defensive end Dominique Easley 
said the term originated toward the end of last season.
  Florida just didn’t face many viola-
tors in 2011.
  UF didn’t reach four fumble recov-
eries until it faced Florida State during the ﬁ  nal game of the regular season. 
  Florida has recovered four fumbles against Vanderbilt and South Caro-lina in the past two weeks. The Gators have forced eight fumbles this season.
  “We got to get the ball back to the 
offense as much as we can and allow them to score points,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. 
  A team that has embraced catch 
phrases like, “Man down, man up,” and, “Florida never breaks,” now has another mantra to live by.
  “It was something unique to here, 
and maybe it was one of those things that started as a buzzword and kind of took off from there,” Quinn said. “It wasn’t one of those things where we sat and talked about it. It was one of those terms that happened by one time calling it, and it stuck.”
Every   week, Quinn shows clips of 
particular opponents not taking care of the football. 
  Then, on Saturdays, players such 
as Purifoy do the rest. Gators defense targeting ‘violators’ to create turnovers

  After struggling with drops 
throughout last season, Jelani Jenkins 
held onto the ball on Saturday. 
  On a third-and-4 play just before 
halftime, Jenkins leapt and inter-cepted South Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw’s pass down the left sideline, drawing a celebratory tackle from coach Will Muschamp. 
  Unfortunately, Lerentee McCray’s 
offside penalty resulted in the play being called back.  
But   just being on the ﬁ  eld was an 
accomplishment for Jenkins, who made four tackles and a sack in his return to action after being limited in UF’s previous four games by a ham-string injury and a fractured right thumb. 
  “It was great to see him back 
playing,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “I was real pleased with how physical he played at the line of scrimmage on a couple of tackles.”
  Jenkins, a junior linebacker, ﬁ  n-
ished third on the team with 75 tack-les last season. 
Quinn said Jenkins has been effec-
tive in coverage and as a blitzer this season. 
  But injuries 
have limited him to only nine tackles so 
far in 2012. 
  “It’s been frustrating,” Jenkins 
said. 
  Since suffering the right thumb 
fracture against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, Jenkins has been forced to practice and play with a cast. 
  The size of Jenkins’ cast has been 
shrinking as the healing process con-tinues, which should make his job easier. 
To this point, the cast has made it  Linebacker happy to returnJURNY DUTY
  The Gators have been playing with ﬁ  re all season. They just haven’t been burned.
  Even after throttling South Carolina 
44-11 on Saturday, Florida has been outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter of every game this season.
  That statistic don’t bother offensive coordi-
nator Brent Pease.
  “If you come into this thing every week 
asking me about yards, I mean, I’m not re-ally concerned about that,” Pease said. “I’m concerned about winning, efﬁ  ciency in the red zone, third-down conversions, (and) ball security.”
  Yes, all that matters is winning. And for 
that reason, no one spends too much time nit-picking at the Gators’ ﬁ  rst seven wins, or say-ing they do not deserve their No. 2 BCS rank-ing. They’ve more than earned it. 
  But the style of play that got Florida those 
wins won’t cut it against Georgia on Satur-day.
  As Pease said, the ﬁ  rst-half yardage totals 
on Saturday were not surprising. The Gators started touchdown drives at the Game-cocks’ 1- and 2-yard lines. The offense sim-ply did what it had to  do in those situations.
  But on Florida’s 
ﬁ  ve drives in the ﬁ  rst half that began 
outside the South Carolina 30-yard line, the offense went three and out on every posses-sion.
  The inability to move the ball early didn’t 
cost the Gators because the Gamecocks turned the ball over three times, but counting on four fumbles every game is unwise. Expecting to recover three of them is equally dicey. 
  If Florida starts slow this Saturday, Geor-
gia is more likely than South Carolina was to build a lead against the Gators. The Bull-dogs average 486.9 yards per game, good for second in the Southeastern Conference. The Florida will need hot start 
to slow Georgia’s pass rush SEE VIOLATORS, PAGE 19

 �MURPHY MADE 59 THREES 
ON 42.1 PERCENT SHOOTING LAST SEASON. 
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Erik Murphy’s perimeter play 
earned increased attention last sea-
son.
After shooting 12 for 30 behind 
the three-point line as a sophomore and failing to register an attempt as a freshman, the forward more than quadrupled his career totals during his third season. 
Murphy finished out his junior 
campaign with 59 threes. He shot 42.1 percent on three-point at-tempts, leading all Gators with at least 50 shots. 
As Murphy prepares to start his 
final season, coach Billy Donovan is looking for the forward to improve his post offense.
“He cannot just be, for us, that 
guy that steps away from the bas-ket and shoots it,” Donovan said on Oct. 10. “The next step for him is can he become a scorer from the pe-rimeter and from the mid-post area or from the low post. He knows he needs to do that.”
In Murphy’s two highest-scor -ing games last season — 18 points against Yale on Dec. 31 and 24 points against Kentucky in the Southeast-ern Conference Tournament semifi-nals on March 10 — only 40 percent of his field goals were inside the arc. More than half of his attempts were three-pointers, which Murphy cred-its to more open looks from beyond the three-point line.  
Murphy said that he learned 
how to establish position in the paint during the offseason.
“(I’m) trying to get better po-
sition on the catch, and when I catch just see the defense and what they’re doing before I make a move and not rush it,” Murphy said. 
With transfer Damontre Harris 
out with a labrum tear, Florida’s frontcourt players were on the court for the majority of Sunday’s scrim-mage. The extra time gave Murphy a greater opportunity to strengthen his post offense.
“I shoot the ball decently well,” 
Murphy said. “I don’t really pay at-tention to how many shots I make or how many shots I take in prac-tice, especially when we’re trying to prepare ourselves for games.” 
Although Murphy needs to im-
prove his post presence offensively, his rebounding and blocking need little improvement. Murphy led Florida in blocks with 37. He also wrapped up last season by grab-bing 29 rebounds in the NCAA Tournament – second most on the team. 
“I’m trying to carry [playing 
physical and rebounding] over as much as possible,” Murphy said.  “Obviously, that’s something that I’ve always tried to get better at. ... I feel that I’m doing well at it now.”
Murphy entered the 2011-12 sea-
son under the radar, which allowed him to create havoc for defenses. He would stretch opponents out by setting a pick and then getting open behind the line, forcing defend-ers to decide whether they should jump out to guard him or stay back to protect the basket. 
This year, Murphy hopes play-
ing the post more will continue to cause problems for the opposition.
“It will definitely help, I think, 
because you have to play me two ways,” he said. “It will also open some stuff up for other guys on the perimeter if I can do some stuff down low.”

tin@alligator.org.
Florida staying composed
more difficult for him to grab op-
ponents on attempted tackles. 
“It’s not the same as having a 
regular hand that you can move all your fingers around with, but I’m used to it,” Jenkins said. “Whatever I’ve got to do to get on the field.”
Gators keeping level heads: Flor-
ida has consistently preached that 
Saturday’s matchup with Geor -
gia is just another game, regard-less of the fact that a trip to the Southeastern Conference cham-pionship game is on the line. For Muschamp, that mentality did not come naturally. 
“I’ve been a part of it and criti-
cal of myself in the past as an as-sistant of guys peaking too early in the week,” Muschamp said. “Sometimes I feel like you’ve lost the game during the week with the amount of energy you go out on the field with.”
Instead, UF’s practice routine is 
the same as it has been all season. 
There are no special pep talks or motivational speeches, even as Muschamp prepares to face his alma mater in one of Florida’s big-gest rivalry games. 
“We understand what’s at 
stake,” Muschamp said. “When we got on the practice field on Mon-day, our guys were excited. You don’t need a bunch of pep talks this week to get them going.”
Rather, Quinn said the coach-
es have had to make an effort to keep the players from getting too riled up. Too much excitement one week can lead to letdowns the next. 
“There’s a lot of calming 
down,” Quinn said. “Will does a terrific job of keeping the focus on the game, and the preparation of what we have to do.” 
Injuries: Wide receiver Latroy 
Pittman (ankle) practiced on Tues-day and is expected to play Satur -
day against Georgia. 
Cornerback Cody Riggs (bro-
ken right foot) and tackle Matt Patchan (strained pectoral) will both be out.

an average of 354.9.
South Carolina defensive end 
Jadeveon Clowney finished with two tackles for a loss and was in the backfield before most of the Florida offensive linemen came out of their stances. The Gators will face an equally disruptive pass rusher this week in Georgia linebacker Jarvis Jones, who is only two sacks behind Clowney despite playing three fewer games this season.
During the Bulldogs’ 24-20 
comeback win against the Gators in 2011, Jones sacked John Brant-ley four times.
“He can cause fumbles,” Pease 
said. “He’s all over the field. They move him. He’s in coverage. He’s rushing. He’s a D-lineman. He’s got an extreme talent and plays the game extremely well.”
The Gators can’t afford to 
fall behind, which would force them to throw the football. Three of Jones’ four sacks in the 2011 matchup came while Florida was leading. Jeff Driskel will become better acquainted with Jones than his predecessor if the Bulldogs grab a lead and force the Gators to be one-dimensional on offense. 
Florida has proven that its 
second-half adjustments will win out if it can keep the game close during the first 30 minutes. 
While Florida has had to come 
from behind, the offense hasn’t had the run game taken off the table in any of those games. They can’t afford to let it happen this week, either.

Defensive back forcing fumbles for Gators
Against South Carolina, Purifoy took ad-
vantage of most teams’ biggest violator — 
the quarterback.
Purifoy blitzed Gamecocks signal caller 
Connor Shaw on the first play from scrim-mage and forced the junior to fumble inside his own 10-yard line.
Florida’s offensive players are repeatedly 
reminded of the importance of ball security in practice.Through seven games, the Gators are 
eighth nationally in turnover margin with a plus-11.
UF’s offense has fum-
bled the ball eight times this season. Three of them have been recovered by  opponents. 
“[The offense is] prob-
ably not doing it in games because of people like Loucheiz,” cornerback 
Jaylen Watkins said. “Coach Muschamp always gets on them if they do fumble. So the same emphasis we have in the game on the ball, we have it against our receivers in practice, so they’re aware of it in the game because of us.”
Sanders didn’t have the benefit of go-
ing up against the Gators’ defense in prac-tice. The junior receiver had no idea what Purifoy was referring to before Florida’s 33-point victory.
“He might now,” Purifoy said.Contact Adam Pincus at apincus@alligator.

Freshman Ziva Recek spikes the ball over the net in Florida’s 3-0 
win against Arkansas on Oct. 5 at the O’Connell Center.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
Coach Mary Wise’s “down 2-0” 
speech isn’t magic. 
Florida made its past two 2-0 
deficits disappear but had noth-
ing up its sleeves as it was swept by No. 12 Florida State (19-2, 10-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) in Tal-lahassee on Wednesday night (25-23, 25-22, 25-21).
No. 11 UF (17-3, 11-0 South-
eastern Conference) defeated Ken-tucky on Oct. 7 and Texas A&M on Sunday after dropping the first two sets of each match. 
Facing its highest-ranked op-
ponent since losing to then-No. 9 Stanford on Sept. 1, Florida faced yet another daunting deficit. 
Although freshman Ziva Recek 
led all players with 16 kills and 39 swings, the Gators could not muster enough quality passes to their other attackers to come back against the Seminoles. 
Associate head coach David 
Boos said Florida’s high totals in kills per set, attacks per set and hitting percentage are useless without a decent passing game.
“The biggest thing for us is that 
we’ve got to have ball control,” he said. 
“You look at the stats, and you 
wouldn’t think that it was that different. We outhit them per -
centage-wise, we outkilled them (and) outblocked them. That pass-ing game doesn’t show up on the sheet as well as everything else does, but that was the difference in the match.”
In addition to the poor passing, 
digs was the one major category Florida did not lead. 
Recek, the 6-foot outside hitter, 
had to take on a heavier defensive role as Taylor Unroe, Holly Pole and Madison Monserez combined for only 24  digs in three sets. 
Recek notched 15 digs, leading 
the Gators in that category for the first time in her career. 
Boos said Florida’s impatience 
led to stray hits on defense.
“We needed to be patient with-
in the rallies,” Boos said. 
“Florida State doesn’t kill a lot 
of balls out of system. They move the ball around here and there, but they’re not going to dominate you. They are best in system. Our job was to get them out of system, [but] we kept giving them balls in easy situations, and they exploited us.”
Florida never built up the of-
fensive firepower it needed.
Boos said Recek’s performance 
was impressive given that she took 47 swings in Sunday’s come-from-behind win. But, against the Semi-noles, the rest of the Gators could not get on the same page. 
As a result, Florida State 
snapped the Florida’s 21-match winning streak in the series and beat Wise for the first time since Oct. 31, 1994.
“It was just a match that we 
never got our treads down,” Boos said. 
“We never quite got any kind of 
traction going and got momentum on our side. And when we did, it was too late. It was too late.”
