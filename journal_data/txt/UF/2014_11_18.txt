The executive vice president of FedEx Corporation spoke to 
a crowd of about 150 students who were eager to learn how to 
design their own future on Monday.
Robert Carter, a UF alumnus and chief information ofﬁ  cer 
for FedEx, opened his talk in the Reitz Union Cinema with the 
technological era and designs in global industries.  
“Dominant design is now something that entrepreneurs are 
making huge investments in because you can get dispropor-
tional payback from making the best goods and services,” he said.  
Carter gave examples of past and present designs but talked 
at length about Uber, a rideshare application that links drivers 
to people in need of rides.
“Uber didn’t invent a whole lot of services out there,” he 
said. “They just basically said ‘Look, there are geographical 
systems, social systems, ways that I can connect them and probably somebody out there that needs a ride.’”
Kevin Prescott, a 21-year-old UF business management and 
telecommunication junior, said Carter’s talk on dominant de-signs and how to become a dominant business within the busi-ness world was insightful.
“Rob Carter came in guns blazing,” Prescott said.During the Q-and-A session, Carter was asked how one 
could predict and build a dominant design.
“You never get it right. You just try to be directionally cor-
rect and less wrong as you go forward,” Carter said. VOLUME 109 ISSUE 60 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

A conﬁ  dential complaint about 
Santa Fe College’s Student Senate 
president spiraled into a series of 
threats and verbal altercations this 
month -- all of which came to a head last Wednesday when the college’s Senate made impeaching its presi-
dent, Jeremy Pierce, possible.
The senate passed a no-conﬁ  -
dence vote against Pierce last week 
— a move that suggests the govern-ing body does not believe 26-year-
old Pierce is ﬁ  t to hold his position.
But the 24-22 vote — with eight 
individuals abstaining — did not 
come without conﬂ  ict.
Senator Kimberly Nance, a 
19-year-old Santa Fe English sopho-more, said one woman announced she accidentally voted in favor of the vote in error. After the woman spoke up, “one or two” others also said they voted incorrectly, but the 
Senate did not agree to a re-tally 
votes.
Despite the possibility, Pierce 
said he isn’t worried about im-
peachment.
“In order for me to be im-
peached,” he said, “there has to be a 
violation of the constitution and its support statues,” which he said he 
hasn’t breached.
Senator Zari Hagos agreed. The 
20-year-old Santa Fe business mar-
keting sophomore said Pierce an-
swers questions, keeps Senate orga-
nized and takes care of business.
“Jeremy’s never made me un-
comfortable,” she said. “He always has an open-door policy.”***
The no-conﬁ  dence vote came 
nearly a month after a complaint 
against Pierce led to a confronta-tion between him and Student Body 
President Michael Chartier -- both of 
whom have criminal backgrounds.
Pierce was charged with domes-
tic violence earlier this year before the case was dropped. And nearly 
eleven years ago, Chartier, 34, faced 
felony charges of petit theft, disor-derly conduct, battery and assault on a law enforcement ofﬁ  cer.
The confrontation between the 
two at the beginning of the month ended in Chartier threatening Pierce with Santa Fe police stepping in, ac-cording to the incident report.
On Nov. 4, a student senator 
conﬁ  ded in the college’s 19-year-old Student Body internal affairs direc-tor, Benjamin Myers.

Temperatures are expected 
to drop below freezing tonight, 
and ofﬁ  cers are warning driv-ers about staying safe in the cold, stormy conditions.
The National Weather 
Service said there will be a hard freeze from tonight un-til Wednesday morning with temperatures falling to the mid- and upper-20s. Highs are expected to reach the 70s again this weekend.
As the cool weather rolled 
in Monday, heavy winds and downed trees were reported to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce during a tornado watch that lasted until 6 p.m. By early afternoon, sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce spokeswoman Becky Butscher reported six accidents, one of which involved injuries.
Drivers are reminded to use 
headlights instead of hazard 
lights in the rain and fog, she 
said. When people pass emer-gency vehicles on the road, they are expected to stay calm and shift lanes.
She said some people stop 
or slow down to take photos, which can cause problems.
“More importantly, people 
just need to pay attention to the road,” she said. Cold front to chill

Lilly Rooks stood strong as she 
told the audience about the stroke 
she suffered six months ago while running for office in Levy County.
Rooks spoke at the UF Health 
Shands Comprehensive Stroke Cen-ter celebration Monday.
The center received the national 
comprehensive stroke center certifi-cation from The Joint Commission, which is a nonprofit independent organization that accredits, certifies and evaluates health care programs in the U.S. Two hospitals including 
Shands have received the certifica-
tion in Florida along with about 78 hospitals in the nation.
“We continue to meet the needs 
where others can’t,” said Dr. Ed 
Jimenez, interim chief executive of-
ficer of UF Health Shands.
He said a plan was started seven 
years ago to develop Shands into a premiere facility for stroke patients.  
Jimenez said Dr. Michael Waters 
and a team of doctors assembled to 
make this happen. Waters, the med-
ical director of the stroke center, said the accreditation couldn’t have hap-pened without the  team.
“The goal was always in sight, 
and the desire to get there is our pa-tients,” Waters said.
He said getting Shands certified 
was a long and tedious process.
“The goal is a very noble and 
worthy one, so that kind of makes the task of getting there very worth-while,” Waters said.
Rooks ended the event by thank-
ing all the doctors who helped her. 
After her recovery, Rooks said, she 
went on to win the election with 71 percent of Levy County’s votes.
“If everything hadn’t had hap-
pened the way it did, I wouldn’t have had this outcome,” Rooks said as she choked back tears.TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Final-exam week may not be 
the only time students are turn-
ing to prescription drugs for a little study aid.  
Abuse of prescription drugs 
is becoming more common-place among college students, according to a new study.
The Partnership for Drug-
Free Kids released a study Thursday that revealed one in five college students have abused prescription drugs at least once in their life.
Of the 1,600 students polled 
in the study, 60 percent admit-ted to abusing Adderall, 20 percent of students admitted to abusing Ritalin, and 14 percent admitted to abusing Vyvanse. These drugs are commonly prescribed to individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder.
According to the 2010 
Healthy Gators Student Sur-
vey, 19.9 percent of the UF stu-dents who responded admitted to trying a prescription drug for non-medical reasons. These are very low rates, Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell, wrote in 
an email.
“It is really important stu-
dents practice healthy behav-
iors and make healthy decisions in regards to their academic performance and time manage-ment, especially while they’re in college because once gradu-ating college and entering into 
the next phase of their life, they will still be experiencing stres-
sors,” she said.
Miller said she recommends 
getting a healthy amount of 
sleep, organizing tasks and as-
signments in a calendar, using study buddies, writing down goals ahead of time and sched-uling daily relaxation time as healthy alternatives to prescrip-tion drug abuse.
Kali Milner, a 21-year-old 
UF industrial engineering se-
nior, said she’s never abused 
prescription drugs but can imagine her classmates would use the drugs to cope with heavy workloads.
“I think if you know some-
one with access to it, you’re more likely to do it,” she said.
Prescription drugs can have 
adverse effects when taken by someone they were not pre-scribed to, Miller said.
“They are really taking a 
chance with their health and not knowing how their body will potentially interact with that medication,” said Miller. Student prescription

abusing prescription drugs between the ages of 13 and 18 years. Pierce had threatened to remove the indi-
vidual from office — a complaint Myers said was similar to complaints other student of-
ficials had repeatedly made against Pierce in 
the past.
Myers agreed to address the senator’s con-
cerns that day. According to a police report, 
the Santa Fe criminal justice sophomore con-
tacted Pierce and arranged to meet with him in Pierce’s office, located within the school’s Student Government building.
In Pierce’s office, Myers and the Senate 
president began discussing the complaint, but the conversation quickly crescendoed. As the pair’s volume increased, associate director for Santa Fe student life Douglas Bagby report-
edly invited both Myers and Pierce to instead 
discuss the situation in his office.
The men agreed, but Myers requested to 
include Chartier, his supervisor.
As Myers and Pierce addressed the sena-
tor’s complaint over arguments, a Santa Fe Police report suggests Chartier joined in, at which point Pierce called Chartier “a f***ing 
douche bag.”
Police said Chartier replied to Pierce and 
said, ‘If you tell me to shut up again, I will 
kick your f***ing face in.”
Bagby intervened and asked Chartier to 
leave the room, at which point police said he 
did. Still, Pierce reported the incident.
Santa Fe Police chief Ed Book sent a re-
cord of the case to the State Attorney’s Office, which said the case did not meet the criteria of 
assault, so no charges were pressed.
Book said that while he viewed Pierce and 
Chartier’s actions as “unprofessional,” the in-
cident “did not rise to the level of a crime.”
But before the state attorney dropped the 
case, Pierce and Bagby exchanged a series of 
emails. The Senate president told Bagby he 
would drop his charges on the condition that 
Chartier never return to Student Government and that “the college takes into consideration this (sic) his actions have clouded my judge-ment and prevented me from being able to 
focus on my academic studies.”
***
Though Pierce shook off the possibility of 
impeachment, senators have the remainder of 
the semester to draft and decide on the mo-
tion.
And though Hagos praised Pierce, Senator 
Bailey Erickson disagreed, citing an Oct. 22 meeting at which Pierce kept senators in their 
chambers until a decision on campus smok-
ing policies was reached.
“Here we go again,” Pierce said, according 
to a video recording of the meeting. “Another 
attempt to impede on our ability to advocate 
for our constituent.”
Pierce threatened to avoid adjourning the 
meeting until the legislation was voted down, keeping campus smoking policies the same.
“Who cares if we’re here till midnight?” 
Pierce said in the meeting. “This is an issue important to my constituents, and I will be here till midnight until I can drill through the heads of my colleagues that this resolution should absolutely be voted down.”
Erickson said aside from Pierce keeping 
Santa Fe senators into the night, the senate 
president has an obligation to be unbiased.
“As a senator, I understand lobbying and 
being passionate and so on,” Erickson said in 
her complaint, “however, if this is truly what happened than it is simply inappropriate coming from our President. [sic]”
Pierce said in an emailed statement that he 
hoped the issue would be resolved “quickly 
and outside of court.”
“This is a very small price for the hell I 
feel like I face daily when I come to work,” 
he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

A Palestinian interests club is chang-
ing up its events for its second annual 
Palestinian People’s Week.
UF Students for Justice in Palestine 
kicked off the week on Monday with a 
Palestinian culture fair.
“This year, we’re focusing more on 
cultural aspects of Palestinian culture,” 
said club president, Tesneem Shraiteh.
The organization primarily focuses 
on the politics of Palestine, but uses this week to inform others about their culture too, said Farah Khan, vice pres-ident of external affairs for Students for Justice in Palestine.
“We want to humanize Palestinians 
because they are systematically dehu-
manized and degraded in the media,” 
said Khan, a 20-year-old UF English 
junior.
The organization will host a culture fashion show tonight with the Arabic Student Union.
Other events during the week in-
clude a Wednesday vigil for all the lives lost during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a demonstration for Hands off Al Aqsa on Thursday.
Al Aqsa is a Jerusalem mosque that 
the Israelis have limited access to. The mosque is only open to men over the age of 50, Khan said.
Khan said the week’s events will 
highlight Palestinian culture.
“We want to show people their art, 
music, literature, their forms of expres-sion and their food too,” Khan said.Club holds Palestine weekStAte

TALLAHASSEE — Florida 
on Monday received $34.3 mil-
lion in a second batch of conser-
vation grants from a settlement 
over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The National Fish and Wild-
life Federation said the money will fund nine projects that were decided upon in consulta-tion with both Florida and fed-eral environmental agencies.
Gov. Rick Scott applauded 
the funding and said the work will protect natural resources for future generations. Many of the projects will benefit the Panhandle.In April 2010, the Deepwa-
ter Horizon oil rig — owned by 
Transocean — exploded, kill-
ing 11 workers off the Louisi-ana Gulf Coast. It triggered the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history and led to lawsuits and criminal charges against Trans-
ocean, BP — which was leasing 
the rig to drill for oil thousands 
of feet below the water — and 
others.
The money is the second 
disbursement from the Gulf Environmental Benefit Fund. It was created by a settlement between the U.S. government, BP and Transocean to resolve 
criminal charges in the spill.
All told, Florida has received more than 
$50 million for 15 restora-
tion projects 
in the state, according to 
the NFWF.
“The Gulf 
Coast was 
badly damaged in 2010, but this money will lead to signifi-cant progress in restoring the 
area’s ecosystem,” said Demo-
cratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in a statement.
“Protecting and restoring 
Florida’s natural resources is vital not only to our state’s 
economy, but to the state’s 
character,” he said.Florida gets $34 million oil

If you were planning to catch 
swinging trapeze artists outside 
the Oaks Mall this week, you’re out of luck. 
Despite what advertisements 
around town still display, Cole Brothers Circus of the Stars is not performing in Gainesville tonight due to financial issues.
The Cole Bros. group has not 
performed locally since March 2013, said marketing director Bruce Pratt.
“We thought we were going to 
be able to do it this fall,” he said. 
The Deland-based act opted 
for an abbreviated Florida tour that ended Sunday in Port St. Lu-cie. That also eliminated stops in Lakeland, Naples, Cape Coral and Bonita Springs. 
Pratt said his team members distributed coupons to local res-taurants and businesses, but when the circus was cancelled on Nov. 3, “unfortunately we had to send them back in to pick them up.”
But on Monday, the McDon-
ald’s on the corner of Southwest 13th Street and West University Avenue was still offering free ad-mit-one child tickets for custom-ers, said manager Whitney Young.
“Honestly I’m not sure what 
happened,” Young said. “We have the tickets sitting in front, so yes, 
they’ve been grabbing those.” 
UF interior design senior Jannel 
Pacheco, 22, had already grabbed 
four admit-one child coupons — 
which also reduce adult admis-sion by $5 — before she found out the circus was canceled. 
She took two from her job at the 
Floor Store of Gainesville, Inc. and 
then two more at Splitz Bowling 
Alley on Nov. 8. 
But when Pacheco went to buy 
her tickets online, the Gainesville 
date wasn’t on the website. 
“I feel like people are just going 
to show up and be like, ‘Where’s the tent?’”

cellations or future tour dates, call

After James Edward Irving Jr. got waffles 
instead of pancakes for his 44th birthday 
breakfast Sunday morning, police said he poked his partner in the eye.
Irving began fighting with the mother of 
his two children at about 9 a.m. because he was upset with his birthday presents and breakfast. He then walked outside of their 
house — located at 2227 SE 11th Ave. — to 
grab some tools.
Irving then went back inside and poked 
the woman under her right eye with his fin-ger. The poke left the wom-an with no visible injury — only mild irritation, a report said.
Irving was arrested on 
charges of domestic battery. He is currently being held on a $5,000 bond.

Despite the continuing Ebola epidemic, a UF 
study suggests the majority of Americans don’t 
intend to change their holiday travel plans.
More than 90 percent of U.S. citizens who par-
ticipated in the survey said the outbreak will not deter them from flying within the country, said Lori Pennington-Gray, professor and director of UF’s Tourism Crisis Management Institute. 
“We thought there might be heightened con-
cerns,” she said, “but we were pleasantly sur-prised.”
The study also suggested that more than 70 
percent of Americans don’t believe contracting Ebola is likely if they travel by plane in the U.S. over the next few weeks, she said — a sigh of re-lief for the tourism and travel industries.Pennington-Gray conducted the study with 
colleagues at the beginning of the month, so the death of a Sierra Leone surgeon with the virus in Omaha on Monday was not addressed.
Still, the UF professor said the biggest change 
she’s witnessed since the epidemic is an empha-sis on sanitation while traveling.  
“I traveled internationally last week and no-
ticed people are taking more precautions,” Pen-nington-Gray said. “I saw a lot of hand sanitizers and wet wipes.”

◗ IT’S AHEAD OF THE FERGU-
SON GRAND JURY VERDICT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Mis-
souri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a 
state of emergency Monday and ac-tivated the National Guard ahead of a grand jury decision about whether 
a white police officer will be charged 
in the fatal shooting of a black 18-year-old in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.
Nixon said the National Guard 
would assist state and local police in case the grand jury’s decision leads to a resurgence of the civil unrest that occurred in the days immedi-ately after the Aug. 9 shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson.
“All people in the St. Louis region 
deserve to feel safe in their commu-nities and to make their voices heard without fear of violence or intimida-tion,” Nixon said in a written state-ment.
There is no specific date for a 
grand jury decision to be revealed, and Nixon gave no indication that an announcement is imminent. But 
St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob 
McCulloch has said that he expects the grand jury to reach a decision in mid-to-late November.
The U.S. Justice Department, 
which is conducting a separate in-vestigation, has not said when its work will be completed.
Brown’s shooting stirred racial 
tensions in the St. Louis suburb, where two-thirds of the residents are black but the police force is almost entirely white. Rioting and looting a day after the shooting led police to respond to subsequent protests with a heavily armored presence that was widely criticized for continuing to escalate tensions. At times, protest-
ers lobbed rocks and Molotov cock-
tails at police, who fired tear gas, smoke canisters and rubber bullets.

UF professor Pierre Ramond 
almost didn’t return the $10,000 
call.
The distinguished UF phys-
ics professor thought the call that 
said “Please call me back, you will 
like what you hear from me,” was from a telemarketer.
When Ramond dialed, H. Frederick Dylla, the CEO of the American Institute of Physics, congratulated him on winning the 2015 Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics.
“I said, ‘Please excuse me, I 
have to sit down a moment,’” Ra-mond said. “I wasn’t quite ready to hear that.”
Ramond is one of two profes-
sors in UF’s physics department to receive prestigious awards in October.  
The other, Art Hebard received 
his congratulatory email while at a conference in Poland. He is one of four recipients of the 2015 Oli-ver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize.
“I was thrilled to hear this. Just 
sitting there in my hotel lobby, I didn’t expect it,” he said.
Hebard’s award consists of 
$20,000 split with the three other collaborators who share the prize. Hebard received the award for his outstanding experimental contri-butions to con-
densed matter 
physics. It is the 
result of experi-ments he began in the mid-1980s involving solid thin-films and altering the su-
perconductivity of the films with factors other than temperature.
Ramond, the director of UF’s 
Institute for Fundamental Theory, said his prize is special because of the recognition from his peers.     It honors the work he has done 
in generalizing string theory to 
superstrings, which can explain 
all matter that makes up the uni-verse.
Within the next year, Ramond’s 
theories will be tested at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
In April, Ramond will attend 
a conference in Baltimore, Mary-
land, to accept his prize.
“That is quite exciting,” he 
said. “Nobody ever gave me $10K 
before.”

Muschamp is stepping down as head coach?Today’s question: Did you get caught in the rain?Silencing student journalism harmful
A shady attempt to hide an ongoing labor dispute 
has turned into an attack on student journalism.
Administrators at Pensacola State College are 
forbidding faculty members to speak with student report-
ers about the unsuccessful wage negotiations between the school and the faculty. The student newspaper published 
only one article about the dispute before the college inter-
vened and attempted to silence any more coverage that 
might appear.
On the day the story was published, the college’s at-
torney contacted the faculty’s union and accused it of il-legally exploiting students for personal gain, citing a state 
law that prohibits unions from using students to endorse union activities. Even though both a state and federal court 
previously declared this law unconstitutional, the college 
ordered faculty members to refrain from answering any questions from student reporters about the labor dispute.
This is a blatant attempt to crush student journalism 
and any more coverage that could result from it. Not only does it strongly suggest the college administration has 
something to hide in regards to the labor dispute and its 
treatment of faculty members, but it also shows just how little the school respects its students and its professors.
Ed Meadows, the college’s president, said the admin-
istration is simply trying to protect students from being taken advantage of by faculty members. He also expressed 
confusion as to why the labor dispute was important 
enough to be written about in the school newspaper, not-ing that not even local newspapers have reported on it: “If 
the local media doesn’t ﬁ  nd it of interest, then why would 
students ﬁ  nd it of interest, and of what beneﬁ  t would it be for students to know?”
It is troubling that the leader of an educational insti-
tution has to ask how faculty pay and hours could affect students.
According to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, about two-thirds of 
college professors are hired on per-semester contracts and only work on a part-time basis, usually earning between 
$20,000 and $25,000 per year. Overworked and underpaid adjunct professors live paycheck 
to paycheck, and they often have 
to juggle multiple courses and 
even second jobs to make ends meet. When sleep-deprived pro-
fessors do not have enough time 
or energy to perform their best in the classroom, both the profes-
sors and the students suffer.
Student journalists at any col-
lege or university have the right 
and the responsibility to report 
on matters that directly impact their peers, and that in-
cludes labor disputes that could result in unfair wages 
for faculty members. If Pensacola State College succeeds in stiﬂ  ing the ability of students to report on the issue, 
student journalists in colleges and universities across the 
state may also be vulnerable to censorship.
Ironically, despite the harmful consequences of his ac-
tions and the fact that he and his administrators are re-fusing to issue a statement to the student newspaper, Meadows seems to believe he is defending the integrity 
of journalism. Good journalism, he argued, requires “two 
sides to every story.”
It is painfully obvious that Meadows has no idea what 
“good journalism” truly is, or what purpose it holds in our society.
Journalism, plain and simple, is about empowering 
people. It empowers them to know about the issues in their communities, in their countries and in their world. Edu-cational institutions, recognizing this, should be proud of 
their student reporters and should help them become the 
most effective journalists they can be.
If colleges and universities decide, instead, to silence 
the voices of their student reporters, they are committing a shameful act against freedom of the press and everything it stands for.

among children 
critical issue
One of the most shameful problems the U.S. confronts to-
day is its massive — and growing — number of homeless people, particularly children. A report released Monday 
by the National Center on Family Homelessness puts the issue of homelessness in America in stark terms.
According to the report, nearly 2.5 million children were 
homeless at some point last year. That number represents an eight-percent increase over the previous year.
The NCFH report, titled “America’s Youngest Outcasts,” 
ranked Florida No. 33 out of the 50 states based on a number of factors related to child homelessness. Although Florida cer-tainly could have done worse on this issue, a closer look at the numbers reveals troubling omens for the future of poverty and homelessness in our state.
Florida followed the national trend of increasing child home-
lessness. Almost 140,000 children were homeless in Florida from 2012-13, up from about 127,000 the previous year.
The Sunshine State ranked a dismal No. 42 in the “Risk for 
Child Homelessness” category. Florida’s home-foreclosure rates are the worst in the country, which means Floridians are at a greater risk of losing homes than residents of any other state.
In addition, 32 percent of households put more than 50 per-
cent of their incomes toward rent, an unsustainable number that 
prevents families from making even the most basic investments 
in health care and education for their children. Perhaps most striking of all, 25 percent of Florida’s children live in poverty — an absolutely horrifying statistic that demonstrates the severe risk of homelessness for hundreds of thousands of our state’s youth.
There are no clear, cure-all solutions to the issue of homeless-
ness in the U.S. Many homeless individuals are in dire need of health care — particularly mental health care — which would 
help bring stability to their lives. More broadly, America must 
improve its education system and expand economic opportu-nity so fewer people risk becoming homeless in the ﬁ  rst place.
Unfortunately, rather than seeking constructive solutions to 
this critical issue, elected ofﬁ  cials in Florida have harassed and intimidated those seeking to address the problem, especially on a small scale. In Fort Lauderdale, police issued an order to 90-year-old World War II veteran Greg Abbott to appear in court for “the criminal violation of an ordinance,” according to 
the New York Times. His offense? Feeding the homeless, in vio-
lation of a rule recently passed in the city.
Throughout Florida, cities from Fort Lauderdale to Daytona 
Beach to Pensacola have passed laws making life more difﬁ  cult for either the homeless or those who seek to aid them.
Criminalizing homelessness and discouraging giving aid to 
those in need are not viable solutions to this issue in Florida or anywhere else in the country. If elected ofﬁ  cials are concerned 
about the effects of a large homeless population on their local 
economies, they should seek to end homelessness rather than attempting to hide or prosecute it.TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

Thank you to the Alligator and to Tenley 
Ross for doing such a ﬁ  ne job on the story about 
Food Chains coming to the Hippodrome State Theatre today. I appreciate that Tenley inter-viewed so many people involved in produc-ing and bringing this incredible documentary to Gainesville for its ﬁ  rst ever showing.
Because the Interfaith Alliance for Immi-
grant Justice was hoping to bring the ﬁ  lm to Gainesville during Coalition of Immokalee Workers week and because of the continual 
support that the IAIJ and the whole Gainesville 
community has shown in support of the farm workers who work with the CIW, the CIW asked the director of Food Chains, Sanjay Rawal, to contact me and the Hippodrome to make sure we could show the ﬁ  lm here in Gainesville before it was mass distributed.
IAIJ has been part of many actions in Ala-
chua County — along with many student and community groups — to bring attention to 
the CIW Fair Food Campaign, including four 
actions in the last month at Publix. Though many corporations have joined the Fair Food Campaign including Aramark, Burger King, Trader Joe’s and Wal-Mart, Publix refuses to even meet with the CIW farm workers. Three Chispas students from UF even joined 100 other supporters for a week of fasting during their Spring Break two years ago in front of the headquarters of Publix.
Come see this incredible ﬁ  lm about what 
people of good conscience can do to support workers who will just not give up in their struggle for justice and dignity in the work-place.

Letter to the Editor
The idea is 
pushed and pushed and 
pushed. If you do not succumb to the 
message, you are thought of as 
ignorant, and if you have not heard it yet, you must have just been born or currently reside under a rock. The idea is this: The Republican Party is ﬁ  lled with selﬁ  sh Americans who de-spise progress. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, is the 
party for those who are “pro-
gressive” and wish to selﬂ  essly help others in need.
This is a popular view, but 
common sense and reality will prove it to be a lie. First, consid-er our country’s debt of approx-imately $18 trillion. Last year we went over the “ﬁ  scal cliff” 
because Republicans would 
not agree to raise the debt ceil-ing. When Republicans run for ofﬁ  ce or propose budgets, some people ask why they will not expand government programs or why they insist on making cuts to these programs. Demo-crats run and champion their 
plans to spend more on these 
programs. Why are Republi-cans so mean and selﬁ  sh?
The U.S. currently holds 
unfunded liabilities of over $115 trillion. Unfunded liabili-ties are the difference between future government spending and future tax revenue. Most 
of these unfunded liabilities are 
a result of Medicare and Social Security. These programs are unsustainable, and whenever Paul Ryan or any other Repub-lican proposes reform, critics say the Republicans don’t care about the poor and elderly. One television ad even shows a Paul 
Ryan-looking man rolling an el-
derly lady in a wheelchair off a cliff. Regardless of the reform’s effects, the trimming of these programs is said to be selﬁ  sh.
Will the debt ever have to 
be repaid? If not, then we es-sentially have access to blank checks and should increase our 
annual deﬁ  cits. However, if we 
eventually have to pay back the money we spend on these programs, I can think of no act more selﬁ  sh than to continue unsustainable spending and push the burden onto the next generation and to those who have not even been born yet. College stu-dents: You are get-
ting screwed. You are told that Republicans are immoral, while the politicians telling you these lies are conﬁ  dent that they will have lived a great life of power and luxury and will be dead by the time you get around to ﬁ  g-uring out that you must be held responsible for their actions.
Democrats mistakenly be-
lieve that the act of spending money that is not theirs is char-ity. In this sense, they refuse to reﬂ  ect on how their actions af-fect future generations, where-as Republicans are forward-looking and conscious of the future. Yet Democrats are said 
to be “progressive”? There is no 
creativity or innovation in the Democratic Party. Their game plan is to recognize problems, blame “the rich” and throw money at these problems.
This is what Democrats have 
done with poverty. Former President Lyndon B. Johnson 
declared the war on poverty 
50 years ago. $22 trillion has been spent on this crusade, but little has changed. This crusade has failed because politicians thought by simply creating centralized, federal programs and increasing spending, the problem would just disappear. 
Among other things, we need 
to increase the control the state has over the money spent on welfare. We can also create in-centives, through grants, for states that are able to actually lift people out of poverty and generate self-sustainability,  rather than government depen-
dence.
I am tired of Democrats 
claiming to be more generous 
than Republicans simply be-cause they are willing to spend more money. We cannot accept that the only solution to prob-lems that arise is to increase spending. We are smarter than 
that. It is time for progressives 
to actually support progress.

Once again, we are approaching 
the glorious American holiday known as Thanksgiving. Millions 
of Americans will travel to visit friends and family, gorge themselves on delicious food and watch football. Millions of other Americans will shovel their Thanksgiving 
meals into their mouths as quickly as pos-
sible in order to join the frenzy of shoppers at their local malls.
Love it or hate it, it’s quintessentially American. But 
we’re missing something. Millions claim they are thank-
ful for their health, friends, family and the bountiful 
food on the table, and most probably are sincere about it. However, it’s due time that we all sincerely give thanks for what we have. Instead of rushing through dinner to 
shop, watching football in silence or ﬁ  ghting with your 
cousins, have another piece of pecan pie, reﬂ  ect on the year that’s passed and give thanks.
By some measures, 2014 has been a lousy year. War, 
disease, political strife and uncertain economic times 
can make a nation and world quite weary, but given the 
circumstances outside our great country, we all need to sit around the table next week and give thanks for all we have. Sure, we may hate the president or despise the 
Republican Congress, or fear what will be around the 
corner, but for Thanksgiving, let’s be content. After all, it’s a day in which we are typically fat and happy. Well, at least fat.
Uncertainty may reign supreme, but after a year 
like 2014, we all deserve a day away from the pressures and stresses of the world and relax. Sure, your travel arrangements might create headaches and the thought of choking down another piece of your long-lost aunt’s 
horrendous fruit cake might drive you mad, but relax. 
Thanksgiving is the great American holiday, and it’s time we enjoy it.
Schools, businesses, government ofﬁ  ces and at least 
a few retail locations close on Thanksgiving — and typi-
cally the day after — as a way to thank their employees and provide millions of Americans a brief 
respite from their hectic work lives. Yet, Thanksgiving stresses us out and inexpli-
cably millions end up spending more time 
shopping that weekend than they do at home shoveling food into their mouths or spending time with relatives.
Last year, I penned a similar column 
bashing retailers who chose to open on Thanksgiving Day, denying their employ-
ees a day off. But this year, it’s time we turn inward and look at ourselves. Thanksgiving occurs with just over a 
month left in the year and provides enough time for self-
reﬂ  ection and perhaps even a small preview of where we want to go next year.
Yet, we seldom consider this when we shovel that 
second helping of stufﬁ  ng on our plates or watch the Detroit Lions lose another Thanksgiving Day football game. We’re counting down the minutes until we leave that long lost aunt’s house or rush to Best Buy in a futile attempt to purchase a ridiculously cheap television.
Most of us are guilty — columnist included — of ig-
noring the deeper meaning of Thanksgiving, but after the year we’ve had, it seems like the right time to start giving meaningful thanks. We can still participate in our 
annual gluttony — both in terms of food and shopping 
— and still ruminate on the year that’s past and the year that’s ahead.
Sure, New Year’s Eve might be the traditional time to 
reﬂ  ect and plan for the new year, but New Year’s Eve is 
typically a time for debauchery and wild parties, where-
as Thanksgiving — despite the overwhelming amount of food — is quieter, pensive and, if we’re lucky, ﬁ  lled with family. Who knows, if you make a New Year’s Res-
olution on Thanksgiving instead of New Year’s Eve, you 
just might be able to keep the resolution because there’s honestly no better time to swear off sweets than after your third piece of pecan pie.

UF’s Department of Multicultural Diver-
sity and Affairs will be relocating to the Reitz 
Union next Fall.
Once construction is completed, the Insti-
tute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures, Institute of 
Black Culture, LGBT Affairs and Asian Paciﬁ  c 
Islander American Affairs will move into the Reitz.
Student ambassadors working for the di-
verse groups will have more opportunity to work intimately, LB Hannahs, director of LGBT Affairs said.
“It’s going to allow us to be more creative 
and build a better and stronger community,” 
Hannahs said.
The LGBT Affairs and Asian Paciﬁ  c Island-
er American Affairs ofﬁ  ces are both located in 
Peabody Hall, Ian Randall, a senior ambassa-dor for LGBT Affairs, said.
“It gets really crowded when we have 
three ambassadors from basically every area, so that’s nine ambassadors ﬁ  tting in this one work room, and working can be difﬁ  cult,” 
Randall, a 21-year-old linguistics senior, said. 
“By having the space in the Reitz, it’ll be more open and more available.”
The Institute of Hispanic-
Latino Cultures and the In-
stitute of Black Culture will 
keep their houses located on West University Avenue.
“It’s a little scary to be 
honest,” Olivia Garcia, Di-rector of the Institute of 
Hispanic-Latino Cultures, said. “We’re so used to being on this side of campus. I think it means we’re going to reach a different kind of 
student or students who might not ever make 
it over University.”Some students like Adrian Jimenez, a 
19-year-old marketing and economics sopho-more, are concerned about the move. 
“I very much cherish the fact that we’re 
away from campus and that we’re an actual house,” Jimenez said. “I feel that the Reitz Union is very busy and that takes away that home feeling.”
But, Jimenez said, he can see the beneﬁ  t of 
having the departments closer together.
“The Reitz is the center of campus and hav-
ing all of MCDA together there means that 
students will be exposed to diversity all the 
time,” he said. Multicultural Diversity and Affairs move to the Reitz Fall 2015

After delaying Webmail’s 
retirement, UF announced 
the email system will be gone by Spring 2015.
UF’s GatorCloud email 
system, a new service pow-ered by Microsoft Ofﬁ  ce 365, will replace Webmail.
Tracy Gale, communica-
tions manager for UF Infor-mation Technology, said the retirement of the “home-grown” email service under-went technical issues, delay-ing the retirement that was expected to happen in the summer of 2014.
“Retiring Webmail im-
pacts not just students but some faculty, staff, and alum-ni that have continued to use their UF webmail accounts,” she wrote in an email.
Delays in retiring Web-
mail were caused by the sys-tem’s size and the amount of email accounts that had yet to migrate before the Summer term.
Student and faculty have 
had the option to migrate their university email ac-counts to the 365 system be-fore the new provider perma-nently replaces UF Webmail.
After Jan. 29, the univer-
sity will schedule mandatory migration dates for students who have not migrated to 
GatorCloud.
The new system comes 
with one terabyte of storage 
available with the Gator-
Cloud email.
Students will also have 
access to the UF global ad-
dress list, receiving contact 
information such as email 
addresses and phone num-
bers for faculty, teaching as-sistants and administrative 
staff, Gale said.
“The goal to move 2,000 
students per week was not 
met, because students did not opt to make the change,” she 
said.
The cost of switching from 
Webmail to GatorCloud was 
not available, but Gale said the cost of maintaining the 
new student email system will 
decrease because GatorCloud 
requires less staff time.
Merin Reji, a 20-year-old 
UF biology junior, said she 
still has her UF Webmail and 
uses it every day.
“I’m pretty happy with 
Webmail right now, ” she said. “Right now, Webmail 
is pretty clean and simple to 
use. I think it’s perfect that 
I’ll get all of my emails trans-ferred to the new system.”UF Webmail to retire

BEIRUT — The Islamic State has 
beheaded Peter Kassig, releasing a 
video Sunday showing a masked militant standing over the severed head of a man it said was the former 
U.S. Army Ranger-turned-aid work-
er, who was seized while delivering relief supplies in Syria last year.
President Barack Obama con-
ﬁ  rmed Kassig’s slaying after a U.S. review of the video, which also showed the mass beheadings of a dozen Syrian soldiers.
The 26-year-old Kassig, who founded an aid 
group to help Syrians caught in their coun-
try’s brutal civil 
war, “was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world 
rightly associates with inhumanity,” Obama said in a statement.
He denounced the extremist 
group, which he said “revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sow-ing death and destruction.”
The slain hostage’s parents, Ed 
and Paula Kassig, said they were “heartbroken” by their son’s kill-
ing, but “incredibly proud” of his 
humanitarian work. Kassig “lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,” the parents said in a statement from Indianapolis.
With Kassig’s death, the group 
has killed ﬁ  ve Westerners it was holding. American journalists James 
Foley and Steven Sotloff were be-
headed, as were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning.

NEW YORK — Police on Monday hunted for the man who 
shoved a stranger off a subway platform to his death and circu-
lated surveillance footage of the suspect walking calmly away from the station just minutes after the fatal push.
Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was standing with his wife on the plat-
form at the Grand Concourse and East 167th Street station in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx on Sunday when he was pushed from behind. Kwok was struck by a southbound D train at around 8:40 a.m. and pronounced dead at the scene. His wife was not injured.
There was no indication that Kwok knew the man or had 
had any interaction with him before he was pushed, police said. His wife said she did not recognize the man. The suspect ﬂ  ed the station and hopped on a city bus two minutes later with others who had been on the platform at the time of the push and unknowingly discussed the incident with the man nearby, police said.
Surveillance footage shows the suspect walking calmly 
from the subway station. Later footage shows him getting off a bus 10 blocks away, heading into a convenience store and then emerging smoking a cigarette. The man is balding and dressed 
in a leather jacket, dark pants and white sneakers. Police are 
trying to determine his whereabouts.

OMAHA — A surgeon who 
contracted Ebola in his native coun-
try Sierra Leone received aggressive treatment at a Nebraska hospital over the weekend but died Monday morning.
Dr. Martin Salia’s death is a re-
minder of how deadly the Ebola virus is and how important it is to receive treatment early, said Dr. Jeff Gold, chancellor of the Univer-sity of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.
Salia, 44, was diagnosed with the 
virus Nov. 6. By the time he arrived at the Omaha hospital Saturday, he was in extremely critical condition with no kidney function and severe respiratory problems.He was placed on kidney dialy-
sis and a ventilator and was given several medications to support his 
organ systems, the hospital said in a 
statement. He was given the experi-mental Ebola drug ZMapp on Sat-urday and received a plasma trans-fusion from an Ebola survivor — a treatment that is believed to provide antibodies to fight the virus.
“We used every possible treat-
ment available to give Dr. Salia every possible opportunity for sur-vival,” said Dr. Phil Smith, medical director of the biocontainment unit. 
“As we have learned, early treat-
ment with these patients is essen-
tial. In Dr. Salia’s case, his disease 
was already extremely advanced by the time he came here for treat-ment.”
Everyone who treated Salia will 
be monitored for 21 days for Ebola symptoms, but they won’t be quar-antined, Smith said.
Salia’s body will be cremated as 
a precaution, Smith said.
Two other Ebola patients have 
been successfully treated at the Omaha hospital. Of the 10 people to be treated for the disease in the U.S., all but two have recovered. Thomas Eric Duncan, of Liberia, died at a Dallas hospital in October.

patients is essential.”

The customer is not al-
ways right in Thomas Puke-
tza’s play, “Work is Cheap,” starring three UF theater stu-dents.
The students are working 
with Puketza, a Gainesville playwright, to put on his show this weekend at The Wooly.    
Puketza drew upon per-
sonal experiences and stories for the play about working in retail, he said.
“It’s funny and it’s fun,” 
Puketza said. “It’s honest. I think people will find it very validating.”
Chris Alfonso, a 21-year-
old UF acting junior, said he will portray a number of char-acters throughout both acts of the play, including customers 
and a member of The Service 
Squad.
The Service Squad will act 
out job training videos such as good service, dress code and sexual harassment, Puke-tza said.
“The play is relevant in 
present day to people who are 
currently in a job they don’t 
enjoy being part of,” Alfonso said. “It’s a story we encour-age the people to hear and be aware of. Attending this play is a journey worth taking.”
Puketza’s script for the 
show was read by James Jen-nings, the president of the 
American Theatre of Actors. “This was a pretty big deal 
for me,” Puketza said. “Rob-
ert De Niro and Paul Sorvino are honorary board mem-bers.”
The meeting led Puketza 
to decide to premiere the play in Gainesville.
“Mr. Jennings told me 
that he liked it, but it had too many characters,” Puketza said. “He wanted to see if I had something simpler be-cause this script would be too expensive.”
Cost is a real concern in 
New York, where unions and other factors could drive a 
budget for a similar show into 
the millions, Puketza said.
“So I decided to do an old 
trick from back in the day: put the show up locally, work out the kinks, and go back to the Broadway universe with a successful proof of concept,” he said.
Puketza went to school 
with actors including Kunal Nayyar from “The Big Bang Theory” and Evan Jonigkeit from “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” but, he said, the “Work is Cheap” cast is just as good.
“They make me feel lucky 
because I know I’ll be seeing 
their names again,” Puketza 
said.
“Work is Cheap” will open 
at The Wooly on Friday night, with showings at 8 p.m. Fri-day and Saturday and at 2 p.m. Sunday. Tickets will be sold at the door for $10.
Puketza encourages guests 
to purchase tickets before-hand through IndieGoGo or online at Brown Paper Tick-ets to avoid long lines.  Play starring three UF
students starts this weekend at The WoolyTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Will Muschamp was the third 
to speak on Monday.
After UF president Bernie Ma-
chen spoke about how he turned 
the football team around off the ﬁ  eld and athletics director Jer-emy Foley followed with nothing 
but praise about who he is as a 
person, it was Muschamp’s turn to talk.
Despite the praise, despite 
what he was able to accomplish, 
Muschamp could not translate 
that to wins.
He won’t be Florida’s head 
coach come December.
And for Muschamp, he under-
stands.
“I appreciate our players and 
how they’ve handled a very dif-ﬁ  cult season,” Muschamp said. 
“You come off of a 4-8 year re-
gardless of the circumstances, from last year, you go through this year and there is a margin of 
error and there is a Bullseye on 
you. 
“Everything is magniﬁ  ed to 
the Nth degree.”
With Muschamp’s tenure as 
Florida’s head football coach concluding following the Florida State game on Nov. 29, Foley an-
nounced that the search for Flor-
ida’s next head coach will begin immediately.
Foley rebutted the notion that 
he has already been in contact with potential candidates, citing 
that it is not his intention to dis-
rupt other teams’ seasons.
“There is no ﬁ  xed timetable 
but we will proceed as quickly as we can,” Foley said. “There 
is a lot of work to do, a lot of re-
search to do. We understand how important this hire is for this uni-versity.”
And after four years of seeing 
Florida fail to crack the top 90 in total offense, Foley knows in 
what direction he needs to head 
when naming Muschamp’s suc-cessor.
“We would obviously like an 
individual that’s been successful 
on the offensive side of the ball,” 
Foley said. 
“I think obviously that’s what 
the Gator Nation wants and we see that and that’s what we’re certainly going to try to provide for them.”
But while the 61-year-old Fo-
ley knows Gator fans want to see the explosive plays on of-fense that have been lacking 
over the past four years, he said 
the school’s integrity will not be compromised when naming a new head coach.
“Our mission statement says, 
‘championship experience with integrity,’” Foley said. “That is 
paramount to us as we move for-
ward. The guy you just saw up here you know epitomized that right there, his integrity without question.
“This is not a place for every-
body, not everybody ﬁ  ts in here.  As we go through the process we want to make sure they do ﬁ  t in here.”

◗ MIAMI DEFEATED FLORIDA 
69-67.
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
Florida basketball coach Billy Don-
ovan’s 33-home game win streak came 
to an end against Miami on Monday night.
The Hurricanes (2-0) defeated the 
No. 8 Gators (1-1) 69-67. 
“I guess streaks are meant to be bro-
ken. I didn’t really look at it that way” Donovan said. “Our basketball team needs to get better.”
The game was won and lost in the 
ﬁ  nal four minutes of the second half. Miami tied things up at 55 with a free throw shot from Miami junior center Tonye Jekiri off a foul from senior for-ward Jacob Kurtz. 
Jekiri’s second free throw was good 
and gave the Canes the lead for the ﬁ  rst time of the night. Two more free throws from Jekiri off a foul on transfer center Jon Horford solidiﬁ  ed Miami’s three-point lead. 
But Florida was quick to respond 
with a three-point shot from Horford. And the back and forth ensued.
Florida took the lead last with 1:01 
remaining in the contest.
Donovan believes the game was 
won and lost in Florida’s fouls. The Gators ended the game with 18 fouls. Miami committed 12.

of the game with three second left to UF basketball’s home win

Will Muschamp is a good man, and 
that’s why Jeremy Foley looked heartbro-
ken Monday as he addressed a room full of 
cameras and reporters. 
The objective of his statements about 
Muschamp were not a PR boost, or some-
thing he can brag about when he goes shop-
ping for a new coach to help him polish off 
Florida’s trophy case. 
That may be an extracurricular result, 
and I may be a sucker, but I believe Jeremy Foley meant every last positive word he 
made about Muschamp’s character.
“Will Muschamp is a good, good person. 
That is why this is so tough for everybody. 
… We wish him the best, I’m proud that 
he’s my friend,” Foley said. 
Does that sound insincere to you? 
I sat 15 feet away from Foley and those 
words hit me like a ton of bricks.
I can tell you it most certainly was not 
insincere.
To Muschamp’s credit, the man has tak-en all of his blows in stride about as well as you can ask 
him to. 
I’m not sure 
I would shrug 
off 50,000 people 
chanting to ﬁ  re me 
in the waning sec-
onds of a crushing defeat. 
He never mailed things in, he faced the 
music, even after the most crushing loss in 
the modern history of the program. 
He was a human being, vulnerable 
through the end, like after the Georgia game 
when he reﬂ  ected on his father’s passing. 
Or Monday, when he cracked a joke 
about AP reporter Mark Long’s speculative questions, and even took a shot at himself when he said, “don’t let that new guy tell you he ain’t got no good players.”
Foley wanted to make this work, and he Muschamp couldn’t get it done

Heading into its game against 
Longwood on Monday, Florida 
coach Amanda Butler empha-
sized the importance of locking down on defense and forcing 
turnovers to create opportunities for its offense.
The Gators (2-0) did just that, 
forcing Longwood (0-2) into 27 turnovers and stealing the ball 20 times on the way to a confidence-boosting 91-46 win at home.
“We wanted to go out and 
be aggressive, attack and have a 
much more consistent defensive 
effort, and I think we did that,” Butler said. “Any time you can hold a team in the 40’s, that’s sig-
nificant.”
Sophomore Ronni Williams 
didn’t miss a shot the entire game, 
going a perfect 8-for-8 from the field and converting all three of 
her free throw attempts to give 
her 19 points for the game. 
Facing an undersized Long-
wood team, Williams scored all 
of her points in the paint, often 
using her large frame to domi-nate the Lancers down low.
“With our guards throwing it 
to me….they threw perfect pass-es,” Williams said. “I was just 
able to catch it and finish.”
The Gators also received effi-
cient play from its shooters, with 
redshirt junior Carlie Needles 
contributing 15 points, nine of 
which came from behind the arc. 
A testament to her defensive 
positioning, Needles led the Gators in rebounding, adding 
eight boards in an impressive all-
around performance.
With the game close at 29-19 
with 5:27 remaining in the first half, Florida essentially put the game away on a 14-0 run to close the half. 
The lead would continue to 
burgeon, with the Gators digging deep into its bench to close out the Lancers.Junior Carla Batchelor, play-
ing her first game for Florida af-
ter transferring in the offseason, 
scored 10 points on 4-for-4 shoot-ing in just five minutes of action. 
It was an impressive perfor-
mance that highlighted Butler’s 
insistence on receiving quality 
bench production — even if the team didn’t need it.
The Gators shot the ball well 
from the free-throw line, going 17-20 from the charity stripe. 
With the team moving the ball 
well in the post, the Gators were able to exploit a small Longwood team, getting 54 points in the 
paint. 
While the Gators gave up 12 
offensive rebounds to the Lanc-
ers, Butler emphasized the offen-
sive rebounding differential was 
due to the uncharacteristically-high amount of shots Longwood took from behind the three-point line.
Considering the emphasis the 
team places on rebounding the ball, Butler was pleased with 
the mental corrections the team 
made following its win over Jack-sonville on Friday.
“There’s not anything physi-
cally or from a strategy-stand-
point that we changed, it was just 
a mental adjustment on an indi-vidual level,” Butler said.JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
On Oct. 27, Mike Taylor said he 
wouldn’t want to play for anyone but Will 
Muschamp.
After Nov. 29, Mike Taylor won’t have 
a choice.
“Nothing compares to what Muschamp 
was,” he said.
Was. Muschamp is not dead, but his 
time at Florida has expired. And a few of his players were there for the funeral.
Taylor, Max Garcia and Chaz Green 
watched as Bernie Machen and Jeremy Fo-
ley eulogized their head football coach for 
about 30 minutes Monday afternoon. 
When it was their turn to address the 
hoard of media, the Gators remained som-
ber.
Their coach was being canned because 
they didn’t do enough in between the side-
lines. Taylor wouldn’t go as far as saying that they failed Muschamp, but he said 
that he and his teammates were “doing the 
wrong thing with the right purpose.”
“It’s just a heart-breaking situation,” 
Garcia said. “All the players in the locker 
room feel the same way. We’re all devas-
tated that this is happening, but we under-
stand the situation. We understand that 
we have to produce and win games on the 
field. That’s the bottom line.”
Although Muschamp’s 27-20 record 
with the Gators was not good enough to keep his job, he made his impact with the players during his time in Gainesville.
Matt Rolin, a redshirt freshman line-
backer, originally committed to South Carolina but flipped to Florida when Mus-champ reached out to him when he had a torn ACL.
Rolin’s parents each graduated from 
South Carolina and his grandfather even played for the Gamecocks football team during his college days. But Muschamp, who Rolin said served as a father figure for him, still managed to lure the lifelong 
South Carolina fan to Florida.
“If it wasn’t for him I would not be 
here at the University of Florida and I can 
promise you that,” Rolin said in a message 
posted on Twitter. “I would have stayed 
committed to South Carolina.”
Unlike Urban Meyer’s “broken” pro-
gram in 2010, Muschamp leaves behind a group united — win or lose.
Throughout the media circus that fol-lowed Muschamp, the Gators stood by their embattled head coach because of the impact he had on each of their lives off the 
field.
Without much football success to boast 
about after four seasons, Muschamp’s 
influence on his team was his crowning 
achievement.
“You’re there for them on Sunday af-
ter a tough loss, you’re there for them on 
Monday when something is going wrong at home and you try and be a great ex-
ample for them through tough times and 
adversity,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s what you do and that’s the role 
here we’re in at present. It’s not just Sat-
urday afternoon, and I feel like that’s a 
strength of mine.”
Now with just two games left in Mus-
champ’s career at Florida, the Gators hope to send their coach out the best way they 
can: 2-0.
In 2004, Ron Zook and his Florida team 
faced a similar situation. Already knowing 
he would not return the following season, 
Zook led the Gators to their first victory 
against the Seminoles in Doak Campbell Stadium since 1986.
Defeating No. 3 FSU while subsequent-
ly knocking the ‘Noles out of the College 
Football Playoff would undoubtedly be 
Muschamp’s greatest feat at Florida.
“I would agree that everyone on the 
team feels like we want to get these last 
two wins for coach Muschamp and send 
him out on the right note and let every-body know that we’re behind him 100 per-cent,” Green said.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

Florida efficient on all cylinders in trumping of LongwoodPlayers supportive of coachplay.  
“I thought (Angel) Rodriguez and 
the fouling were the difference in the 
game,” Donovan said.
Miami’s redshirt junior guard An-
gel Rodriguez scored 24 of Miami’s 69 points on Monday. Even with 24 points for the night, Rodriguez had only managed 2 points and was 1-for-5 on field goals after the first half.
Carter ended Monday leading the 
Gators with 21 total points. 
On the entire night he missed just 
one field goal.
“We played pretty good in the first 
half,” Carter said. “We’ve got to put 40 minutes together.”
A missed jumper from junior 
guard Michael Frazier at the buzzer left Florida two points shy of the win. 
With only two seconds left to play, 
Frazier was working with tough cir-cumstances and Donovan said he re-spects his efforts.If Carter hadn’t fouled out a sec-
ond earlier, the final shot could have been his to make.
“The ball got thrown the length of 
the floor. Devin Robinson made a nice 
catch and threw it to Frazier,” Dono-
van said. “I wonder If Frazier could have taken a dribble because their center kind of stood up, I just almost thought he could have taken a dribble and maybe gone to the rim but in the heat of the moment 2.3 seconds…I’d rather have him shoot at the basket.”
Horford said it’s representative of 
a larger trend of Florida letting go in the second half.
“It’s been a recurring theme,” 
Horford said. “We haven’t been as strong in the second half for whatever reason, I’m not sure what that is but I’m very sure that we’re going to go into practice these next few days and we’re going to correct it.”
Donovan echoed Horford and said 
he was unsure how his team was able to perform defensively in the first half but not in the second. Miami outscored Florida 48-34 in the second half while Florida outscored Miami 33-21 in the first.
“Is it fatigue, is it lack of discipline, 
I don’t know,” Donovan said. “But we 
certainly showed the capability of do-
ing it in the first half because we had great energy in the first half.”
Donovan made the first adjustment 
of the season to his starting lineup on Monday. Donovan replaced injured junior forward Dorian Finney-Smith with senior walk-on Jacob Kurtz. Monday marked Kurtz’s first career-
start. Kurtz totaled 36 minutes, six 
points, eight rebounds and two as-sists.
Donovan said he doesn’t expect 
Finney-Smith to be playing on Friday against Louisiana-Monroe because he is concerned about prolonging the re-covery process if Finney-Smith does play. 
Donovan said Finney-Smith, who 
dressed and warmed-up for Mon-day’s game, understands that he’s not ready to play due to pain.
wanted to make it work badly, some would argue a 
little too badly. 
He was looking for any ray of hope after a 4-8 
campaign. 
He said as much when he said if the Gators could 
have won out and showed improvement this season that Muschamp would be back.
It will fall on deaf ears, but there is a human ele-
ment to what coaches do. 
I know you don’t want to hear that. I know you 
want to believe Will Muschamp is an ignorant Ne-anderthal that drove Florida’s football program into 
the ground. 
I know you want to believe these guys are mil-
lionaires, and Muschamp will wipe his tears with 
a multi-million dollar buyout, but that’s not what I 
saw Monday afternoon as Foley stood at the lectern. 
I saw disappointment. I saw the hurt of a dream crumbled. I saw frustration. 
Have you ever been so frustrated with something 
you thought was going to work but didn’t? Some-
thing you wanted so badly but it just wasn’t meant 
to be? 
That’s Jeremy Foley’s relationship with Will Mus-
champ.
Imagine what it would feel like to have it all fall 
apart when Foley wanted Muschamp to succeed. 
Multiply that by going on national television to 
talk about the end of Muschamp’s era. 
To admit that Muschamp failed which means by 
proxy Foley failed, because Foley hired him. 
Monday’s press conference stuck me like a pseu-
do-graduation at times, like Foley was sending him out into the world with full confidence that he would 
do well because he knows of his potential.
Foley even said so, “He’s won a lot of champion-
ships in his career; he will win more, I promise you 
that.”
I have no doubt that Jeremy Foley will root for 
Will Muschamp moving forward wherever it is that he ends up.
That is the true measure of their relationship over 
anything else. 
It was more than employer-employee, more than 
contracts and games, even if that’s all you ever thought it was.  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida was tested, and then it was re-
warded.
The test was Kentucky, the only legiti-
mate challenger to Florida’s hold on the 
Southeastern Conference crown.
On Sunday, UF secured at least a share of 
the SEC championship with its 3-1 win over UK.
The reward came after the match, even if 
it only lasted for one course.
“The (players) sent over Shainah Joseph 
to my table afterwards and asked if they could have dessert,” coach Mary Wise said.
It was a luxury for a team dinner, but cer-
tainly justified after Florida clinched its 21st conference championship in program his-tory and second one in three years. With one more victory in its next three matches, UF will own the title outright.
And yet, despite the reward, the celebra-
tion is still far away.
“This is a school that never takes champi-
onships for granted,” Wise said. 
Florida still has three remaining confer-
ence matches and a season finale against No.3 Texas before it begins tournament play.
Even so, the Gators are in a comfortable 
spot.
There is no doubt Florida’s daunting 
early season schedule worked in its favor, when it faced four top-15 opponents during 
a one-week span in mid-September. 
Not only has Florida improved as a unit 
as a result of those matches, but its younger 
players have all made strides as well. 
Wise mentioned sophomore Alex Hol-ston, who has pushed past the nerves of her freshman season and into a more comfort-able position as one of Florida’s offensive leaders.
“There was a point in Alex’s career ear-
lier where an (error) might have carried over 
from set to set, and that certainly didn’t yes-
terday,” Wise said.
Florida’s coach also made note of Rhamat 
Alhassan and her rapid success in transi-tioning into college volleyball, faster than even Wise could have predicted before the 
season began. 
Against Kentucky when UF needed her the most, the freshman tallied 15 kills, a 
team-high 4 blocks and a .478 hitting clip.
“In what has been the biggest stage so far, 
to put up the numbers she did, that speaks to her development,” Wise said.
The win also spoke to the development 
of the team as a whole, who, before Sunday, had not lost a set in over a month.
Florida fought back after dropping the 
second set against Kentucky, and passed the test that was presented to them.
“We needed to play a team like Ken-
tucky, as well as they played,” Wise said. “The resiliency these players showed in that environment, it was a great testament to 
how far our team has come in this part of 
the season.”
For Florida, the SEC championship was 
its dessert.
The real reward is still up for grabs.Clinching share of SEC title just the first step for Florida 
“This is a school that never takes 
championships for granted.”

In a season where the Gators have been 
relatively healthy, Florida lost two key 
defensive players, Will Muschamp an-
nounced Monday.
Redshirt senior Neiron Ball and sopho-
more Jarrad Davis both had meniscus sur-
gery and will be out for the season.
“Extremely disappointed for both those 
guys,” Muschamp said. “Both (were) hav-ing great years, and certainly (want to) get those guys rehabbed as quickly as pos-sible.”
Through nine games, Ball had 49 tack-
les, which was tied with Dante Fowler Jr. for second on the team. 
Ball’s five quarterback hurries lead all 
of Florida’s linebackers.
Davis started the year on special teams 
and received more playing time as the sea-
son progressed.
Prior to being injured on the opening 
kickoff of Florida’s 23-20 overtime loss to 
South Carolina on Saturday, Davis had 23 tackles — one of which was for loss — and 
three quarterback hurries.MORGAN MORIARTY

Will Muschamp has had his 
share of highs and lows during his 
time as Florida’s head coach. Here 
are a few.
Five Highs: 
Gator Bowl Victory to cap 
2011 season: Muschamp fin-ished his inaugural season at Florida with a 24-17 win over Ohio State in the Gator Bowl. The victory came right before 
former Florida head coach Ur-
ban Meyer accepted the OSU head coaching job. 
2012 Recruiting Class: The 
Muschamp Era seemed to be trending in the right direction, 
as he assembled the No. 3 re-
cruiting class in the country in 2012. This class was his first true recruiting class during his tenor at Florida. 
2012 LSU Upset: Florida 
upset then-No. 4 LSU at home 14-6. The Gators were down by six at halftime, and was carried 
by running back Mike Gillislee, 
who scored two touchdowns in the second half and finished with 146 yards on the ground. 2012 Florida State Win: Mus-
champ and UF capped the 2012 regular season with a 37-26 road victory over the Gators’ 
most hated rival, Florida State, 
in 2012. The Gators defense forced five turnovers and held the ‘Noles to 112 rushing yards. 
2014 Georgia Upset: Mus-
champ looked to have saved his job three weeks ago with a 38-20 upset victory over the 
then-No. 11 Georgia Bulldogs. 
Florida rushed for 418 yards, which marked the second most rushing yards given up in Geor-gia football history. 
Five Lows: Sugar Bowl Blowout follow-
ing 2012 season: After an excit-ing and improbable 11-1 year in 2012, Florida earned a BCS Bowl bid to the Sugar Bowl, 
where it would face Louisville. 
Although the Gators were highly favored, they were em-barrassed in New Orleans and lost with a final score of 33-23.
2013 Georgia Southern Shock-
er: Florida’s embarrassing 26-20 loss to Georgia Southern at home was Florida’s first loss to 
an FCS school in program his-
tory. The Gators had won their previous seven games against FCS opponents by an average of 45 points. 
2013 Vanderbilt Loss: Florida 
inexplicably lost to Vander-bilt at home, on Homecoming no less, last season. The loss 
marked Vanderbilt’s first win 
over Florida since 1945. That’s right, the World War II Era. 
2014 Missouri Loss: Will Mus-
champ’s Florida Gators lost 
two consecutive Homecoming 
games with an embarrassing 42-13 loss to Missouri. The loss also took Florida’s chances of 
winning the SEC East out of 
their own hands. 
2014 South Carolina Debacle:  
Florida seemingly had this one 
in the bag, but a blocked kick and a blocked punt late in the fourth quarter allowed South Carolina to tie things up and force the game into overtime. Florida would score a field goal on their possession, but Caro-lina’s touchdown in theirs put the nail in Muschamp’s coffin.  16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2014

Highlights from Will Muschamp’s UF career
“Extremely disappointed for both 
those guys. Both (were) having 
great years, and certainly (want to) 
get those guys rehabbed as quickly 
as possible.”
