 As the fourth quarter wore on, Jon 
Halapio could see the fatigue creep-
ing across LSU defensive tackle Josh Downs’ face. 
  Florida’s offense was in the midst 
of a stretch of 25 consecutive run plays, the ﬁ  nal step in its physical 14-6 dis-mantling of LSU on Oct. 6. 
  Every down pushed the Tigers clos-
er to the edge. 
  Mike Gillislee for 10. Gillislee for 9. 
Jeff Driskel for 3. Mack Brown for 5. Brown for 7. Gillislee for 3. Solomon Patton for 3. 
  Downs and the rest of the Tigers’ 
defensive line were running on empty . 
  “I was looking in his eyes, and he 
was dead tired,” Halapio said. 
  Meanwhile, Gillislee and the Gators 
were only getting stronger. 
  The man many Florida players have 
credited for their stamina, ﬁ  rst-year di-rector of strength and conditioning Jeff Dillman, was roaming the sidelines. 
  In all likelihood, he was yelling.   Shouting “Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
yeah,” is Dillman’s signature, but he often takes a more focused approach. He wants the Gators to ﬁ  nish.
“That’s why we play four,” Dillman 
yells on the sidelines. “This game is 60 minutes. Just keep punching them in the mouth.”
  After the Gators consistently wilted 
late during close games in 2011, Dill-man’s emphasis on closing strong hit home in the offseason. 
  And if Florida needs any extra re-
minders, Dillman is there on Satur-days, too.
  “He was probably the most 
pumped-up person on the sidelines,” Jaylen Watkins said after Florida’s win against LSU. “You would think that he was going in and out of the game.”
     
  Turning the team coach Will Mus-
champ called “soft” at the end of 2011 into a group of ﬁ  nishers was not an overnight process. 
  Florida was outscored 72-22 in the 
fourth quarter of Southeastern Con-ference games last season. Most of the Gators have that number committed to memory . 
  “Coach Dillman pretty much in-
grained it in our minds,” wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “Every workout we came into, he reminded us. It stuck in our heads. We don’t want to have that score. It needs to be ﬂ  ipped around.”
  Dillman has used inspirational vid-
eos and quotes from athletes like Mi-chael Jordan, but perhaps nothing pro-vided the Gators greater motivation than that score. Muschamp said the coaches beat the ﬁ  gure into the play-ers’ heads. 
  The number compelled them to 
work harder in the weight room. When the weight training was ﬁ  nished, the Gators would take the practice ﬁ  eld for 110-yard sprints. 
  Dillman was hired in January , and 
by the midpoint of spring practice of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease could see the difference in his linemen. 
  “Their bodies are changing,” Pease 
said on March 21. 
  On March 29, linebacker Jon Bostic 
said he had put on about 10 pounds of muscle since the end of the 2011 sea-son. 
  The workload and intensity re-
mained high through summer and into fall camp. 
  “It was hard,” Driskel said. “[Dill-
man] said going in: ‘It’s going to be hard, but it’s going to pay off and you’re going to see the results during the season.’ We’re deﬁ  nitely seeing them now.”
  Through six games, the Gators have 
outscored their opponents 54-10 in the fourth quarter. They hold a 440-101 edge in rushing and win the fourth-quarter time of possession battle by an average of 9:25 to 5:35.
  The trend ties in to another of Dill-man’s many mantras: “Start fast, ﬁ  nish strong.”
  
  When Dillman left IMG Academy 
in Bradenton after two years to take a position at Florida, director Trevor Moawad knew where to begin his search for a replacement. 
  Moawad again plucked from the 
coaching tree of LSU strength and con-ditioning coordinator Tommy Mofﬁ  tt, who is entering his 13th season with the Tigers and has produced some of the best strength coaches in all of sports. 
  In addition to Dillman and Scott 
Gadeken — Dillman’s replacement as the head of physical conditioning 
at IMG — Mofﬁ  tt’s teachings have 
sculpted Florida State head strength and conditioning coach Vic Viloria and Alabama director of strength and con-ditioning Scott Cochran. 
  While working under Mofﬁ  tt as 
LSU’s assistant strength and condi-tioning coach from 2003-06, Dillman learned the value of a strength pro-gram based on Olympic lifting, which Moawad described as a “lost art.”
  Many modern weight-training pro-
grams focus on toning muscles and pre-venting injuries, but Olympic training is about building explosive strength. The Gators have shifted their weight room work to include mostly snatches and clean and jerks. With fewer reps at heavier weight, Florida’s players have added mass and explosiveness. Defen-sive tackle Omar Hunter said he gained more in the most recent offseason than in any of his previous four with UF. 
  “I feel like I’m more explosive now 
than I’ve ever been,” Hunter said.  
  Bostic echoed the sentiment.  “I feel more explosive, stronger than 
I’ve ever been,” he said. 
  Muschamp saw the value in the 
system when he was with LSU as the linebackers coach in 2001 and as the defensive coordinator in 2002-04. 
  When Mickey Marotti — UF’s 
strength coach of seven seasons — left Florida after 2011 to work for Urban Meyer at Ohio State, Muschamp saw an opportunity to get “back to the old core lifting that I was accustomed to.”
  “I saw the success that we had do-
ing the core lifts and squat and power clean and the development of those players [at LSU],” Muschamp said. “When Jeff and I talked, that’s what I said I want. We’re going back to what we know.”
  
  What Dillman brings to Florida’s 
weight room is more than just an inti-mate knowledge of elite physical train-ing. 
  He brings energy, he brings enthu-
siasm, and he brings passion.
  “When you walked in the IMG 
athletic center, you knew you were in Jeff Dillman’s house,” Moawad said. “Whether you were Maria Sharapova, Cam Newton or a 13-year-old, you knew that you were coming in there to work.”
  Whether he was working with a 
teenage tennis player, a sureﬁ  re ﬁ  rst-round NFL Draft pick or the senior executive of a Fortune 500 company , Dillman approached training the same way. 
  They’d all hear the “Yeah, yeah, 
yeah” yell and they’d all get a taste of his comedic side, which included shouts like “Wakey , wakey , eggs and bakey ,” for early-morning workouts.  
  Moawad, who specializes in men-
tal conditioning, saw how everything from Dillman’s tone of voice, to his inﬂ  ection and even his body language helped him get the most out of ath-letes. 
  “You’re going to be motivated 
through fear, through incentive or through your desire to be great,” Moawad said. “Jeff knew how to use all three of those very, very well.”
  Dillman always moved around the 
weight room quickly , wanting to be at the “eye of the storm,” as he called it. 
  Moawad said the shift from the 
technicians IMG usually employed to a motivator like Dillman came as a shock to the athletes. Not long after Dillman was hired, they all came around. 
  “They loved him,” Moawad said.    Dillman has brought that attitude to 
Florida. 
  “He has a lot of energy ,” Bostic said. 
“He’s funny. He helps us have a good time in the weight room.”
  Dillman has also brought a champi-onship pedigree.  
  After winning a BCS Championship 
with LSU in 2003, Dillman served with the Tigers for two more seasons before becoming the director of strength and conditioning at Appalachian State, his alma mater. 
  Appalachian State was coming off 
of an FCS national championship, and Dillman played an integral role in win-ning two more. 
  “While he put his own stamp on 
things, it was more a matter of him maintaining and building upon what was already here, which he did,” Ap-palachian State coach Jerry Moore said. “He was a huge part of us winning two more national championships in 2006 and 2007.”
  Dillman won national champion-
ships in his ﬁ  rst season at both LSU and Appalachian State. Florida is No. 2 in the BCS poll. 
  
  When Muschamp took to the po-
dium after Florida’s win against LSU, Dillman came up within the ﬁ  rst 20 seconds. 
  “I can’t speak further without talk-
ing about Jeff Dillman,” Muschamp said. “It was very evident on the foot-ball ﬁ  eld that we had a strong, physical football team.”
  Later that night, Pease sent Dill-
man and assistant director for strength and conditioning Jesse Ackerman a text message: “Thanks. You’re doing a great job. Thanks for showing up in this game.”
  “Our guys got stronger as it went 
along,” Pease said. “When I look down there and [the LSU players] have got their hands on their hips, and our guys are still rearing to go, that’s a product of what they’ve done from the sum-mer.”
  In one offseason, Dillman has 
helped bring about a total transforma-tion. A season after ﬁ  nishing 7-6, the Gators are 6-0 and in the thick of the national championship race. 
  “Last year we weren’t in that kind 
of conditioning,” center Jonotthan Harrison said. “That kind of condition is sorry. But now, this year, it’s really showing that all our work in the offsea-son is really paying off.”

A proposed plan to build a nuclear power plant 
near Levy County has a small group of Alachua 
County residents in an uproar over the potential en-vironmental and safety hazards, despite assurances by company ofﬁ  cials that the plant will be closely regulated.
Francine Robinson, chairwoman of the Committee 
for Nuclear Responsibility in the Florida League of Conservation V oters, held a press conference in front of the Alachua County Family and Civil Courthouse Thursday regarding resident opposition to the plant. Nine people, including four reporters, attended.
“It’s an environmental disaster,” former  
Gainesville Mayor Tom Bussing said at the press con-ference.
Mark Goldstein, another former Gainesville may-
or, said he’s concerned about the possibility of nuclear exposure to Alachua County if the plant is built.
Progress Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke En-
ergy, is building the plant to boost energy production in the state, said Suzanne Grant, a Progress Energy Florida spokeswoman. The company bought 5,000 acres for the Levy County plant, which is expected to be in service starting in 2024 and will run for 60 Some residents

Police are increasing security Saturday to 
deal with issues like rowdy fans and underage 
drinking before, at and after UF’s football game against the University of South Carolina.
Gainesville Police will deploy about 100 
uniformed ofﬁ  cers to monitor tailgating ac-tivities, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said. This includes GPD foot and mounted units, and a SWAT Team on standby, he said.
ESPN’s College GameDay show is planned 
to be outside the North End Zone of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. GPD ofﬁ  cers will help pro-vide security for the event, Tobias said.
This game is what police call a “premium 
game,” said University Police Special Events Coordinator Lt. William Gainey. Premium games attract a lot of national interest, which results in an increase in police ofﬁ  cers.
“With that attention comes certainly a 
heightened sense of security,” Gainey said.
UPD undercover ofﬁ  cers and bicycle teams 
will patrol tailgates for possible crimes, he added.
“I’m more concerned with the overall in-
creased congestion that we’re going to have on campus,” Gainey said.
To prevent overcrowding, UPD will block 
off the area within Union Road, Newell Road and Southwest 13th Street. 
When it’s packed with people parking and 
tailgating, the location can become dangerous, Gainey said.
Despite potentially rowdy crowds, police 
said they will have Saturday’s events under control.
“Preparation for UF gameday is a calculat-
ed response that has been practiced for years,” Tobias said.

Cats that ﬁ  nd themselves stuck un-
der Bryan Hall can now escape without 
pause.
After a UF employee removed a grate 
with a crowbar to save a trapped cat on Monday, the university responded to a few employees’ concerns about the feral cat community on campus.
On Wednesday, UF’s Physical Plant 
modiﬁ  ed the existing grate so animals can exit — but not enter — the crawl space underneath Bryan Hall, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Joan Lyon, the senior secretary at War-
rington College of Business Administra-tion, said she watched the installation of the new grate underneath Bryan Hall. She was pleased with how promptly the grate was installed.
“I think we have a good future,” Lyon 
said.
Kat Worden, ofﬁ  ce manager at War-
rington’s Center for Management Com-munication, said she suggested the one-way door after she removed the grate Monday.
Though she is satisﬁ  ed with the new 
door, Worden said she would like to see a more permanent solution.
“What they’ve done right now is a 
step forward,” she said.
Sikes said there will be an open dis-
cussion among the university, UF Police Chief Linda Stump and UF College of V eterinary Medicine’s Maddie’s Shelter Medical Program director Julie Levy to address the feral cat population issue.Bryan Hall adds pet doorSEE NUCLEAR, PAGE 4

Four Florida Supreme Court justices 
left their black robes in Tallahassee to 
speak at a forum at the UF Levin College of Law on Thursday afternoon.
About 120 people attended “The Im-
portance of an Independent Judiciary ,” an event sponsored by the Gerald T. Bennett Inn of Court and the Florida Bar Young Lawyers Division Law Students Division.
The majority of the justices, four out 
of seven, responded to the invitation to participate in the forum. Justices Jorge La-barga, R. Fred Lewis, Barbara J. Pariente and Peggy A. Quince discussed merit retention decided through voter election as a threat to a fair and balanced judicial system.
“The people of Florida deserve a judi-
cial branch that is not beholden to the big guys or the little guys,” Lewis said during the discussion.
UF adjunct law professor Carl B. 
Schwait began the event, and Dean Jon L. Mills introduced the justices.
“We take for granted what the Consti-
tution did for an independent judiciary,” Mills told the crowd.
Afterward, a panel of three law stu-
dents asked questions to the justices about politicizing merit retention and 
diminished judicial funding.
After the event, 
president of the Florida Bar Young Lawyers Di-vision Law Student Di-vision Allie Menegakis

� THE EVENT WILL INCLUDE FREE 
FOOD AND A TALENT SHOWCASE.

UF’s Homecoming officially kicks off at 
the Soulfest Multicultural Extravaganza at 5 
p.m. today in the Reitz Union Amphitheatre. Soulfest is free and open to the public, accord-ing to a press release.
Event Director Marshall Rivers said 
Soulfest is an opportunity for diverse student organizations to come together and showcase their talents.
“It’s an upbeat celebration of culture,” he 
said.
Soulfest will consist of a student organiza-
tion fair on the Reitz Union Colonnade, free international foods on the North Lawn and a talent showcase in the amphitheatre.
Sabor Latino, a solo performer and 10 other 
groups will participate in the showcase, Rivers said. The winner of Soulfest’s “Best in Show” award will perform at UF Homecoming’s Gator Growl event Nov. 9.This year, the theme of Soulfest is “Journey 
Through America: One Mind, One Body , One SOUL,” which mirrors UF Homecoming’s theme “United We Growl,” Rivers said.
“The elections are coming up,” he said. 
“There is nothing better than an all-American theme.”
Soulfest will benefit LifeSouth and UF’s 
Collegiate Veterans Society. Collection boxes will be out from 5 p.m. to 6:45 p.m, Rivers said. Attendees can donate hygiene items like toothpaste, baby wipes and personal first-aid kits for veterans.
Sabor Latino, the official dance team of UF’s 
Hispanic Student Association, won Soulfest in 2011. This year, the group will try to defend its title, team president Albert Perera said. The 21-year-old psychology senior said the group will implement Soulfest’s theme by “fusing” American and Latino culture.
“I believe we have found a perfect balance 
of what everyone wants, so we can please all communities and audiences,” Perera said.
Rivers said about 2,000 people attended 
Soulfest last year. He hopes this year’s event meets or exceeds that number.
“I want Soulfest to keep building,” he said. Homecoming kicks off tonightyears.
Robinson said she is con-
cerned about the amount of wa-
ter the nuclear plant would take from the Florida aquifer, saying the plant would require one mil-lion gallons a day.
Less than 1 percent of the 
water to run the plant will come from the aquifer, Grant said. The rest will come from the Gulf of Mexico.
Robinson said she was also 
concerned about the 50-mile emergency evacuation radius, which covers Alachua, Levy and other neighboring counties.
Grant said she wasn’t sure 
the scope of the radius but said there is an emergency plan in place. There is also a plan to store nuclear waste on-site, she said.To fund the project, Progress 
Energy Florida customers, in-cluding UF, have already seen increases in their electric bills. Robinson said these customers will not get refunds if the plant isn’t built. 
Customers with a 1,000-
kilowatt-hour bill are currently paying an additional $2.67 per month, she said.
The Atomic Safety and Li-
censing Board Panel, which is part of the U.S. Nuclear Regu-latory Commission, will host a hearing at 9 a.m. on Oct. 31 at the Levy County Courthouse, where community concerns will be addressed, Grant said
“We developed this plan 
so that we would meet all the regulatory requirements,” Grant said. “In addressing these con-tentions, we feel the project re-mains viable and will continue to go forward.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2012

Help for ﬁ  nancially struggling 
Gainesville residents is now avail-
able through a new texting service. 
United Way of North Central 
Florida launched a free texting ser-vice, United 2-1-1, a few weeks ago.
The service, which helps people 
with issues related to housing, food, elder care and utility bills, was pre-viously available if residents called or emailed the center. Now, people can text 898-211 or TXT211 for help, said Debbie Mason, organization president and CEO.
“We’re always looking for ways 
to enhance our reach,” she said. “I think it’s going to be well re-ceived.”
Those needing help should text 
their ZIP code to 2-1-1 to get started. Counselors will respond and do their best to refer people to a place nearby, Mason said.
For example, if a person needed 
a meal, counselors would text him or her directions to the nearest food bank.
“We, as human beings, all need 
help at some point in our lives,” she said.
United Way 2-1-1 is the organi-
zation’s signature service, Mason said, and has been around for more than 30 years.
She said she thinks texting will 
better serve current users and will help the organization reach out to more people who need the servic-es.
“As technology evolved, it’s al-
lowed us to serve people with dif-ferent modalities,” she said. “Now, texting is more common, so we’ve evolved our modality to include that.”
Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias, Gainesville 
Police spokesman, said some peo-ple are afraid to pick up the phone to get help.“When you get to a point when 
you need to ask for help, it’s embar-rassing,” he said. “Text can be a little more anonymous.”
Mason agreed, adding that the 
texting option might encourage people to seek help earlier.  
Tobias said the service could 
beneﬁ  t Gainesville speciﬁ  cally be-cause students are tied to their cell-phones, and an electronic option might be more approachable.
Bob Woods, city spokesman, 
said statistics show that young peo-ple use texting the most now, but older people are beginning to text more often. 
Mason said United Way 2-1-1 
is important because it serves resi-dents of all races, ethnicities and income levels. The texting option is especially helpful for those who don’t have access to a computer, In-ternet or a home phone, she said.
Woods said it’s a valuable re-
source for United Way to make sure those looking for help can get it.
“It’s another tool in the toolbox,” 
he said.

◗ SHAKES CONTAIN 15 TO 20 GRAMS OF 
PROTEIN PER SERVING.
MICHAEL SCOTT DAVIDSON
Alligator Writer
A team including four UF grads released a pocket-
sized protein shake this week.
After three years of research, countless formula trials 
and a first sample that “tasted like paste,” Gator alum-
ni-owned company Pocket Protein released two liquid protein-shot products on Monday. The whey-protein-isolate products can pack as much as 20 grams of pro-tein in a two-ounce bottle.
Company CEO and Gator advertising alumnus Mike 
Kauffman said the idea for the product began five years ago. The self-described “gym rat” had seen four-ounce liquid protein shots at the gym.
“I made an immediate connection because I was al-
ways in a race home to get to my blender to make a pro-tein shake,” he said. “I asked myself, ‘Why aren’t those in the same two-ounce bottles as 5-hour ENERGY?’”
Matt Weisman, a 20-year-old economics junior, said 
he thought Pocket Protein would be more convenient than his protein shaker. Conventional protein shakers require gathering ingredients, making the shake and keeping the shaker clean, he said.“If you don’t clean it immediately, it smells like mil-
dew,” he said.
The protein shots come in two flavors: blue-bottled, 
20-gram “Berry Boom!!” and pink-bottled, 15-gram “Sneaky-Strawberry ,” which were formulated for men and women, respectively, according to the web-site. There are also custom orange-and-blue bottles for Gators.
Justin Patrick, a 21-year-old journalism junior, said 
he thought the product’s small size made it more ap-pealing than using a shaker.
“Protein shakes can be pretty unbearable some of the 
time because of the taste,” he said. “It makes it easier on whoever is drinking it to get it down.”
Kauffman said Pocket Protein wasn’t intended only 
for health enthusiasts. He said one of the benefits of pro-tein is improved satiety, or the feeling of being full. This means someone can pair Pocket Protein with a bagel or french fries, Kauffman said, and it’ll feel like a meal.
He said he hoped the product would soon be avail-
able in vending machines, airplanes and movie the-aters.
“We’re not looking for a fitness crowd. We’re just 
saying, ‘Get your protein,’” Kauffman said. “Seven bil-lion people on seven different continents need our prod-uct several times a day.”

92 TOTAL VOTESRomney looks right through the glass ceiling
Considering he’s provided me with inspiration for 
several of my columns, a goal of mine for this week was to avoid mentioning Mitt Romney . But alas, I 
watched the second presidential debate Tuesday night, and yet again, that man’s mouth provided far too much fodder for criticism.
During the town hall debate, a woman in the audience 
asked the candidates, “In what new ways do you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, speciﬁ  cally regard-ing females making only 72 percent of what their male coun-terparts earn?” 
This was a great question, as the male-female wage dis-
parity in our country is indeed a very real and troubling is-sue. Women actually earn a bit more than 77 percent of what men make, but it’s still 23 percent too little. 
This income disparity of more than 20 cents per dollar is 
indicative of a scourge of sex discrimination that has plagued female workers since their entry into the workplace.
In his response, President Obama subtly evaded the ques-
tion by pointing only to his signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which was the ﬁ  rst major piece of legislation passed by his administration. In all fairness, the passage of this bill was an important step forward, as the bill resets the 180-day statute of limitations for ﬁ  ling a wage-discrimination lawsuit with each new paycheck earned by the plaintiff.
Prior to the law, the statute of limitations began with the 
ﬁ  rst discriminatory paycheck, which would typically occur far before an employee would be able to discover that she was being discriminated against.
Mitt Romney , on the other hand, very blatantly evaded 
the question by refusing to admit that women deserve to earn equal pay for equal work and, in the process, insulted female workers by objectifying them in the middle of a vague and convoluted answer:
“… We took a concerted effort to go out and ﬁ  nd women 
who had backgrounds that could be qualiﬁ  ed to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us ﬁ  nd folks?’ And I brought us whole binders full of — of women … What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employ-ers are looking to ﬁ  nd good em-ployees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a … ﬂ  exible work schedule that gives women the opportunities that … they would otherwise not be able to … afford.”
Within minutes of Romney’s 
answer, Facebook groups and a 
Tumblr blog by the name of “Binders Full of Women” went viral, featuring dozens of macros and user comments mock-ing Romney’s sexist remark.
Romney’s proposed solution to the morally repugnant 
reality of sex discrimination is to encourage businesses to provide more ﬂ  exible schedules to women so that they can go home at the end of the day and cook dinner.
Without question, workplace ﬂ  exibility is a legitimate 
example of progressive reform that employers should deﬁ  -nitely consider implementing. However, it by no means pro-vides a remedy of any kind to the fact that women earn 77 cents for every dollar men make.
The reason Romney couldn’t offer a better answer is be-
cause, quite simply, Republicans live in a bubble. In this bub-ble, in addition to all their other misguided perceptions, they are convinced the pay gap between men and women doesn’t exist. This delusion was brought to full view when Repub-lican strategist Alex Castellanos condescended to MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on “Meet the Press” last April and told her the pay disparity was a myth.
According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, 
“Women are almost half of the workforce. They are the equal, if not main, breadwinner in four out of 10 families. They re-ceive more college and graduate degrees than men.”
In the wake of all the progress we have made in guaran-
teeing equal rights for all Americans, a great deal of work remains. Not the least of this work is cementing equal pay for equal work for women.

The Nobel Peace Prize, perhaps at one 
time a universally admired achieve-ment, has managed to take yet anoth-
er step toward becoming a complete farce.
Just three years after granting newly 
elected Barack Obama the prize for little more than the content of his campaign speeches, the politicians that comprise the Norwegian Nobel Committee gave the award to the European Union, a decision that left much of the world scratching its collective head in confusion.
According to the Nobel Committee, the 
EU deserved the honor for having “over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.”
Essentially, the committee deemed it ap-
propriate to reward most of the members of an entire continent for behaving exactly as they should — for not attacking one an-other.
Of course, many EU member states have 
engaged in some sort of armed conflict in the past six decades.
But an undistinguished history of partic-
ipation in international military operations is not enough to discredit the EU alone; af-ter all, the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-tion — not the EU — serves as the military coordinator for much of the continent.
No, the Nobel Committee’s decision is 
flawed for two main reasons: It affords the shared ideals of the EU too much credit for the continuing peace on the continent, and it completely ignores the present-day quag-mire in which the EU finds itself.
The idea that European peace is a direct 
result of the liberal values shared through-out the continent is a nice one. This type of thinking appeals to our idealism as good Westerners and to our senses of democracy, freedom and fairness.
But solely concentrating on the prolifera-
tion of liberalism as the cause for peace, as the Nobel Committee does, leaves a much more visceral factor out of the equation — the rather large United States military pres-ence in Europe.
From the end of World War II to the 
modern day, the U.S. has maintained signif-icant amounts of personnel and equipment across the European continent. The explicit purpose of such an expensive and large force — approximately 90,000 men and women — is not to prevent, for example, France and Germany from attacking one another again.
Rather, the preservation of such a pres-
ence grants the U.S. easier access to the Mid-dle East and offers the military a better position from which to respond to emer -
gency situations.
Regardless of 
U.S. intention, however, European states are the beneficiaries of such a security blanket. They have to worry less about providing for their own defenses and can concentrate funds and efforts on welfare programs or other potentially stabilizing projects.
And, of course, a large and capable 
American military presence is likely to de-ter an unfavorable balance of power from materializing in Europe — just in case, say, Germany started wondering about exactly how much it could flex its ever-growing muscles.
So perhaps the Nobel Committee should 
have awarded the prize to the U.S. Army as a joint declaration for having “over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.”
And of course, the EU as it exists now is 
in rather poor shape.
Anyone not living under a rock is aware 
that the EU is still in the midst of a fiscal cri-sis that has been ongoing for several years.Less wealthy and less financially com-
petent countries, such as Greece and Spain, have been forced by more wealthy and more financially competent countries, mainly Germany, to impose strict austerity measures on irate populaces, which have responded with protests that have at times devolved into violent riots.
At this point, it is not unreasonable to 
state that the only glue holding the EU’s fiscal union together is German willingness to act as a bailout fund; nor is it unreason-able to assume that German tolerance and patience will eventually evaporate.
If this happens and chaos results, the 
financial pact between EU nations will be abandoned, and the entire ideal of Europe-an unity will have been dealt a death blow.
The Nobel Committee is obviously well 
aware of the fragile state of the EU. Perhaps it felt a Nobel Prize would do something for morale on the continent. But there were other, more deserving candidates.
And how such an esteemed body could 
so blatantly ignore the harsh status quo of its chosen winner, in the form of current unrest and possibly impending pandemo-nium, is inexplicable.

Six-year-old Alessandra Quintana dipped her fin-

“It’s goopy,” she said with surprise.
The Mexicans in Gainesville Student Association 
hosted a piñata-making event last weekend as the first of a two-part workshop scheduled to continue at 9 a.m. Saturday in Frazier Rogers Hall. Attendees can complete the piñata-making process by adorning their handiwork with paper cones, tissue paper and stream-ers.
Newcomers are welcome but will have to pay $15 to 
take home the candy-carrying creation.
Last weekend, four people of varying ages and 
backgrounds met to learn about the history and impor -
tance of the activity to Mexican culture before creating their own craft.
“When they go out and see a piñata, they will under -
stand our culture,” said 29-year-old Melissa Ramirez, president of Mexicans in Gainesville Student Associa-tion and second-year agricultural and biological engi-neering Ph.D. student.
Traditional Mexican piñatas have their roots in Ca-
tholicism, with each of the seven decorative peaks — or cones — representing one of the deadly sins, said Hilda Patricia Rodriguez-Armenta, treasurer of the organi-zation and third-year horticultural sciences Ph.D. stu-dent.
“When you break the piñata, you’re breaking the sins,” Rodriguez, 30, said.
Each aspect of the craft symbolizes an individual’s 
struggle against sin, the piñata itself representing evil disguised as good. The blindfold and stick used to hit the piñata symbolize faith and virtue, respectively . As a reward for defeating evil, the individual receives can-dy, Ramirez said.
Organizers said they completed the first step of 
the process a few days prior by gluing a few layers of newspaper onto balloons. Last Saturday , the attendees attached a rope and plastered on about three more lay-ers of paper with paste.
Ramirez said all proceeds will be donated to the An-
gel Tree project, and any completed piñatas not bought at the workshop will be sold to support the charity.
Twenty-six-year-old Li Zhang, a third-year agricul-
tural and biological engineering Ph.D. student, wasn’t familiar with the charity but came because she wanted to “do good.”
“I like to help,” she said while bunching up pink 
and red streamers.
For Alessandra, deciding on the best part of piñatas 
was simple.
“Getting the candy,” she said.UF organization continues to host

A therapy organization is going 
to do some horsing around Sunday.
HOrses Helping PEople Inc. will 
have its annual Fall Festival fund-
raiser Sunday at 9722 SW 153 Ave. in Archer. 
HOPE will host pony rides, a 
bounce house, carnival games, a petting zoo and live music, said Kristen Cooper, executive director of HOPE.
The festival is free, and activities 
cost between $1 and $4. Cooper said she hopes to raise $3,500 for the up-keep of the property and animals.
The organization provides occu-pational therapy for patients of all ages that have a variety of disabili-ties. It was started 12 years ago in a Shands at UF physician’s backyard and is now at a 40-acre location, said Cooper.
The therapy is provided by the 
program’s “six-and-a-half horses”: Candy , Sammy , Chilly , Alvin, Andy, Harry and Rocky, the min-iature horse. The horses, which are often older, are donated by people in the community, said Cooper.
“The horses can really judge who 
needs them and what they need out of them,” she said.
For Cathi Brown, a founder and 
board member of the organization, the outcome is well worth the cost of upkeep.
“This gives patients a new view 
of the world,” she said. “It gives them hope and motivation.”Fundraiser to support

Gainesville’s nonprofit or -
ganizations, including those as-
sociated with UF, are helping make life better for the county’s residents, according to a recent study.
The Nonprofit Center of 
North Central Florida presented a study , The State of the Sector: Nonprofits in Alachua County , Monday that states county non-profit organizations are influenc-ing the quality of life for Alachua County residents and improving the economy.
Twenty percent of the coun-
ty’s workforce is employed by nonprofit organizations, accord-ing to the study . They employ 23,458 people and make $2.84 billion in revenue.
The Nonprofit Center of 
North Central Florida partnered with KBT & Associates to pro-duce the study , which focused on local nonprofit organizations that made $25,000 or more in revenue in 2010.  
This is the first study of its 
kind to be done in Alachua Coun-ty, said Christopher Johnson, ex-ecutive director at The Nonprofit Center of North Central Florida.
He said the Nonprofit Center 
of North Central Florida plans to do a similar study in four or five years to keep track of the growth.
Johnson said the study was 
a way to determine the needs of nonprofit organizations and to understand the influence they have on the community.
The study stated 40 of the 305 
listed nonprofits are associated with UF.  
Josh Funderburke, execu-tive director at the UF Center for Leadership and Service, said the study was a great way to see a snapshot of the business side of nonprofit organizations. 
The study said 26,336 vol-
unteers worked at nonprofits in 2010. 
Funderburke said stu-
dents who want to stay in the Gainesville area should remem-ber that nonprofit organizations offer job opportunities.
Marcia Conwell, executive 
director at Bread of the Mighty Food Bank, believes the study’s results are accurate because she sees the community’s support every day.
The Bread of the Mighty Food 
Bank has a staff of 22 and 50 vol-unteers per week.
“Nonprofits and the com-
munity need to continue work-ing together to continue on the right path,” she said. “We can do a lot as one unit,” she said, “but when there are multiple, we can achieve a lot more.”

nonprofits provide more

Hunter Joyer didn’t mind 
stepping out of the spotlight.
In fact, he did it willingly.
“I really don’t care,” Joyer 
said. “That doesn’t bother me at all. I’m not looking for TV time or my name to be talked about a lot. I just want the team to do well.”
The sophomore fullback had 
been a running back his entire life before coming to Florida. During his senior season at Tampa Cath-olic High, Joyer led the team with 84 carries for 496 yards and five touchdowns. 
In 19 games as a Gator, Joyer 
has carried the ball just 20 times.
With reduced carries came an 
exponentially increased blocking responsibility. Although Joyer had never blocked before, he em-braced his new role. 
“I just felt like that’s the rea-
son that I’m here,” Joyer said. “I’m not here to get touches, get carries. I didn’t really know any fundamentals, but it wasn’t ex-tremely difficult to pick up. It’s not too easy. It’s not as easy as people probably think it is.”
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said that Joyer is doing more than just throwing a block at the first defender he sees. He’s taking the scheme into account and deciding which defender he should pick up.
“He’s fitting blocks well and 
his guys aren’t making tackles,” Pease said. “I mean not just for Jeff (Driskel), but he’s done it for Mike (Gillislee).”
Joyer’s natural blocking ability 
has cleared the way for Gillislee this season. Florida’s starting running back leads all South-eastern Conference backs with 615 rushing yards. Joyer said he enjoys being the lead blocker for 
After a weekend of debauchery in Nashville, Tenn., the alliga-torSports crew comes home 
to Gainesville. We’re worn out from country music and Coyote Ugly sa-loons, but we’re just as excited to see College GameDay on campus as ev-eryone else is for one reason: Erin An-drews. Oh, wait. That was awkward. No matter who the sideline reporter is, we’ve got you covered. Reporters and photographers will be behind the scenes creating a multimedia piece to be featured on alligatorSports.org (Sorry for the shameless plug). Sounds exciting, right? In the meantime, we let two of our writers debate one of this weekend’s showdowns.
Now, onto the picks…
West Virginia (-2.5) will make 
Kansas State wish it was back in Kan-
sas because…
Geno Smith is 5-1 in games follow-
ing a loss during his three years as the Mountaineers’ starting quarterback. This gunslinger is one quarterback you don’t want to mess with. He’s aver -
aged 230 passing yards per game on 65 percent passing with 13 touchdowns in those games. Clearly , bounce-back games are just as automatic for Smith as picking wrong is for Lee Corso.

Kansas State (+2.5) will send West 
Virginia tumbling down its mountain because…
 The Mountaineers are down in the 
dumps. Their Heisman-frontrunner quarterback squashed  their  chances 
of hosting  GameDay with the most disappointing 275-yard game ever in their blowout loss to Texas Tech last week. Conversely , the GameDay crew is already planning its trip to Manhat-tan, Kan., to do a feature on Heisman darkhorse Collin Klein, who has the Wildcats sitting pretty at 6-0.

Jo Dragotta’s past nine games have been 
what statistics majors would call an outlier. 
In her first three seasons at UF, she ac-
cumulated only seven points, all of which 
came from assists. However, in her last nine games, Dragotta has notched 11 points — all but one coming on goals.
“When I see [my teammates], they’ll say 
stuff like, ‘Hey, all-star,’” Dragotta said. “It’s all in good fun.”
Coach Becky Burleigh said Dragotta has 
been an important player on the team for a long time, but the recent flurry of goals has brought more attention to Dragotta than ever before.
“We have always appreciated that Jo has  
(made) a huge contribution to our team, but it’s kind of neat to see other people starting to realize that,” Burleigh said. “If it takes 
stats for that to happen, that’s OK, but we knew it all along.”
Dragotta’s offen-
sive outburst has played a key role in the Gators’ current nine-game winning streak. Florida will look to extend that streak to 11 when it faces Alabama and Vanderbilt this weekend.
Dragotta is not the only Gator who has provided a hot foot on offense during the streak. Since coming back from an ankle injury on Oct. 5, senior Erika Tymrak has registered six points on two goals and two  assists. Seniors McKenzie Barney and Holly King, junior Adriana Leon and sophomore Havana Solaun have all scored three times during the nine-game run.
The offense is averaging 2.8 goals per 
game, and has scored three or more goals four times during the streak.
“When you look at our goal scoring, it’s 
so diverse and spread out,” Burleigh said. “I think that’s a problem for other teams when they play us.”
The offense isn’t the only part of the team 
that has been hot during the streak. The de-fense has not allowed more than one goal in 
Senior midfielder finally finds scoring touch

see soCCer, P age 15Leading the way at 34-22 is Rivals’ Bryan “SWIFT ALERT!” 
Holt, who has his satellite radio programmed to notify him 
whenever Taylor Swift’s “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” is playing on any station anywhere. Sorry , Holt, but you actually have to end a real relationship before jamming to breakup songs. One-night stands with grenades don’t count.
In second at 32-24 is The Associated Press’ Mark “I dress 
like I’m in middle school” Long, who continues to rock the same plaid shorts everybody bought in sixth grade. His clos-et looks like it came straight from a PacSun catalog. C’mon, man. You’d think a Jaguars beat writer would at least move up to Abercrombie & Fitch.
In third at 31-25 is The Miami Herald’s Matt “They want to 
fight us“ Watts, who threatened to kill people over the week-end for the following reasons: talking, eating potato chips, not stopping the car for a cigarette break, listing to the Paul Fine-baum Show, holding a six-pack of Smirnoff Ice and much, much more. What a guy!
In fourth at 30-26 is The Palm Beach Post’s Jason “Any-
where but Haiti or Detroit” Lieser, who isn’t picky about where he raises his kids, save for two locations. Apparently things like quality public school systems and low crime rates are overrated. “Let’s just move to Antarctica, honey. It’s what-ever!”
In fifth at 29-27 is alligatorSports editor Greg “Who wants 
to watch me on camera?” Luca, who said earlier this week no one wants to hear what any of us has to say on video. Sadly, you are half-right. The people would rather you stay behind the lens. It isn’t your words. It’s just, they’d rather not see you.
In sixth at 28-28 is alligatorSports writer Adam “Super 
Size Me!” Pincus, who visited a White Castle stone-cold sober and ordered 10 burgers, two orders of fries and two boxes of chicken rings all for himself. Have some self control, man.
In seventh at 27-29 is alligatorSports assistant editor Joe “I 
have weird fetishes” Morgan, who for some reason couldn’t stop raving about foam fingers. After a box was delivered to the office, he dove right in and began smelling the damn things. Dude, that’s weird. 
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 25-
31 is alligatorSports writer Josh “The party never stops!” Jurnovoy, who dropped $75 in downtown Nashville on Fri-day night and was still wearing his over-21 paper bracelet on Tuesday. Well, I guess you got your money’s worth!
Gillislee.
“I think we all do,” Joyer said of taking pride in 
Gillislee’s statistics. “All of us, the offensive line as 
well, because it’s more of a team thing. But he’s still a great back, he deserves all the credit and every-thing for what he does.”
Another job that often falls on Joyer’s shoulders 
is protecting Driskel when he drops back to pass. On Saturday against South Carolina, that may entail blocking Jadeveon Clowney. The 6-foot-6, 256-pound sophomore defensive end is second in the SEC in both sacks and tackles for loss. Joyer said the task is a challenge he’s not shying away from.
“He’s a phenomenal player,” Joyer said of 
Clowney. “Probably one of the best in the nation, overall, so I really look forward to it.”
Whether he is humbly accepting a switch to a 
less glamorous position or eagerly taking on a tough blocking assignment, Joyer displays a willingness to do whatever the offense asks of him. His head coach appreciates it.
“He’s a very unselfish player and epitomizes 
what we want here at Florida,” coach Will Mus-champ said.

  The rock of the Gators defense is 6 feet 1 inch  
tall and plays in net. Goalkeeper Taylor Burke 
has excelled during the winning streak, holding opponents to a goals against average of .684. 
  “We’re just seeing her conﬁ  dence grow and 
her getting better and better,” Burleigh said last week.
  The last time the Gators won nine straight 
games was in 2010, when they went on a run that took them through the Southeastern Con-ference Tournament and into the NCAA Tour-nament. This year’s team has similar aspira-tions.
  “It’s kind of hard to compare the teams,” 
Tymrak said. “I’ll tell you this: This is a really special team, and I can tell this team has more mentality, and more drive and passion for it than I’ve ever been a part of.” 16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19, 2012

 The crowd at the O’Connell Center 
jeered and yelled, but Madison Mon-
serez, mouth agape, couldn’t eke out a word.
  Senior outside hitter Sarah Bullock 
of Auburn spiked a ball at Monserez during Sunday’s match against No. 11 Florida after the ofﬁ  cial blew the whistle, ending the rally. 
Bullock told the ofﬁ  cial, who called 
her over immediately after the inci-dent, that she didn’t hear the whistle blow.
  Senior Betsy Smith said the contro-
versial spike was yet another indica-tion that matches against Southeast-ern Conference rivals, like Auburn, are more intense than those out of conference. 
She added that the Gators will have 
to put their emotions aside and focus on volleyball.  “There are certain players that are 
very emotional players,” Smith said. 
“We knew that [Bullock] was going 
to be an emotional player. We don’t take it as anything. We expected it. We try to just (say), ‘All right, on to the next point.’”
  Florida (15-2, 9-0 SEC) expects to 
see more of the same intensity when it 
faces Alabama (14-7, 3-6 SEC) in Tuscaloosa, Ala., on Friday 
night at 8. UF then gets its ﬁ  rst taste of SEC newcomer Texas A&M on Sunday at 2 p.m. in College Station, Texas.
  Coach Mary Wise said because 
Florida plays almost every SEC rival twice each season, the Gators get to know their opponents. 
Wise said Florida’s emotion comes 
from playing opponents it faces on a regular basis, and she loves that con-ference play can bring out that type of passion.  In fact, she said she admires the 
way Bullock plays ﬁ  ery and hard-nosed volleyball.
  “The biggest difference is the fa-
miliarity,” Wise said. 
“There’s only a few teams we don’t 
play twice so they are so familiar with each other. ... (Bullock) is one of our staff’s favorite players because of how hard she plays. We’ve seen this for four years. She is one of my favor-ites. I love how she plays. I’m going to send her a graduation card.”
  Sophomore Holly Pole said the 
Gators never know what to expect when they go on the road. 
But she knows that Florida is ex-
cited for another grind-it-out SEC matchup.
“In the O’Dome you have all your 
fans,” Pole said. 
“Everyone is cheering for you. On 
the road, sometimes teams will have tons of fans, sometimes there will be no one in the gym. It’s just impor-tant that we get our energy from our-selves and bring that energy to every game.”

When Will Muschamp thinks of 
legendary coaches in the Southeast-
ern Conference, he thinks of head-gear. Specifically , a houndstooth hat and a visor.
“There are really two coaches that 
come to the forefront of your mind as far as what they’ve done for this league,” Muschamp said. “That’s Bear Bryant and Steve Spurrier.”
Spurrier has a statue outside of 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium that com-memorates his playing career at UF, which included winning the Heis-man Trophy in 1966.
However, what Spurrier accom-
plished with a clipboard on the side-lines proved far more instrumental in establishing Florida as a premier college football program.
In the 83 seasons before Spurrier 
arrived at UF in 1990, the Gators av-eraged just 5.3 wins per season and had never won a conference cham-pionship, let alone a national title.
During his 12-year tenure, Spur -
rier averaged 10.2 victories per season, won six SEC titles and de-livered Florida’s first-ever national championship in 1996.
He also introduced the “Fun 
‘n Gun” offense to the SEC, which helped quarterback Danny Wuerffel win the 1996 Heisman Trophy . With Wuerffel under center, Florida be-came the first school to tally more than 500 points in a season for four straight years (1993-96) since the NCAA started keeping statistics in 1937.
“You look at what he did when 
he came to our league,” Muschamp said. “It was more of a ‘3 yards and a pile of dust’ league, and he came in and spread the ball out a little bit.”
Said UF linebacker Jon Bostic: 
“He likes to air it out. He can draw up a lot of differ -
ent things and give a defense head-aches.”
UF quarterback Jeff Driskel does 
not know much from Spurrier’s ten-ure at Florida except what the record books say . However, he’s well aware of the Ol’ Ball Coach’s legacy.
“It’s hard to miss the statue,” 
Driskel said. “It’s hard to miss a guy that named our stadium.”
For the past eight years, Spurrier 
has been working to match his suc-cess at Florida in Columbia, S.C. In his eighth season at South Carolina, Spurrier has already put his name in the record books.
In 2010, he led the Gamecocks 
to their first SEC Eastern Division Championship, which he clinched with a 36-14 blowout win against the Gators in The Swamp. Last season, he led South Carolina to a program-best 11 victories and a No. 9 final ranking — the highest final ranking in Gamecocks history.
Twice in his tenure at South Car -
olina, Spurrier has beaten Florida to prevent the Gators from advancing to the SEC Championship Game. Most recently, it happened in 2010.
“It was tough,” Gators wide re-
ceiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said of watching the Gamecocks celebrate winning the SEC East in Gainesville two years ago.
When Spurrier and South Caro-
lina come to Ben Hill Griffin Stadi-um on Saturday at 3:30 p.m., it will mark the first-ever top-10 matchup between the two squads. 
Raising the stakes, the Gators 
and the Gamecocks are currently the top two teams in the SEC East standings.
Saturday’s game will feature two 
key contenders in the 2012 national championship race, and Spurrier is responsible for building each pro-gram.
Spurrier is focused on delivering 
South Carolina its first crystal foot-ball, much like he did for Florida. He has tried to downplay his con-nection to UF this week, but admit-ted returning to The Swamp is still an odd feeling.
“I guess it is a little unusual to be 
on the other team when you come into the ball park and your name is on the wall up there,” Spurrier said.
