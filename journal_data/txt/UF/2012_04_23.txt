The Architecture Computer Lab will be 
closed during the summer for renovations, but 
students taking summer classes will be able to go to the Computer Science and Engineering Computer Lab instead.
The Architecture Computer Lab’s tablet 
computers will be moved to the CSE Computer Lab, which will be open 24 hours a day during the summer.
The Architecture Computer Lab will be re-
opened on the ﬁ  rst day of Fall semester.
Renovation plans include upgrading the 
air conditioning system and lighting in the lab, said Adam Brown, operations manager for UF’s Information Technology  — Academic Technol-ogy Learning Spaces Support.
Today is the last day for students to make 
suggestions for further renovations. Sugges-tions can be emailed to Brown at browad@uﬂ  .edu.
“We don’t have an unlimited budget, but if 
there is a student submission or we come across something we really like and we think will help the learning process in whatever way, we’ll def-initely try and make it happen,” Brown said.
Abigail Figaro, a 19-year-old architecture 
sophomore, is no stranger to working through the night in the lab.
Figaro said the lab is inefﬁ  cient because it 
doesn’t have enough computers.
Rendering, a process used by architecture 
and design students to convert hand-drawn designs into digital designs, can take up to 12 hours. Figaro said that process would be more convenient if there were more computers to work on.
Air conditioning and lighting are the least of 
her concerns.

Catherine Hooker crept toward the 
silver Mercury Sable, the one wrapped 
around the palm tree, and peeked inside Saturday night. The driver was alive, and moving, and talking.
“Just stay still until the paramedics 
arrive,” said Hooker, whose father is an emergency room physician in Destin.
“That’s probably the best advice I ever 
heard,” said Louis M. Penque Jr., 20.  
“Are you OK?” she asked.“Weed is a magical drug,” Penque re-
sponded, according to Hooker.
Soon after 10 p.m. Saturday , about 
ﬁ  ve minutes after the crash, ofﬁ  cers and paramedics responded to the scene at the entrance of Fairmont Oaks apartments, 316 SW 62nd Blvd. Paramedics freed Penque, who is listed as a student in the UF Phonebook, and he appeared healthy . Before he was told to lie on a stretcher, he laughed and raised both arms.
Gainesville Police spokeswoman Cpl. 
Angelina Valuri said the crash is still un-der investigation. Ofﬁ  cers drew blood from Penque to see if he had used drugs Saturday night, and they are awaiting the results.
Before the crash, Hooker said she 
drove south on Southwest 62nd Street. The Sable sped toward her from be-hind, going 70 or 80 mph. When Penque reached Hooker’s car, he veered left into the wrong lane.
The Sable tipped left, Hooker said, 
and Penque overcorrected. Now leaning Student walks away from crash

The chairman of the UF Board of 
Trustees, Carlos Alfonso, announced his resignation Friday.
In a statement, Alfonso said he has 
withdrawn his application for reappoint-ment, which would have needed approv-al from Gov. Rick Scott.
“I always considered myself an ad-
vocate for the students, and that’s how I’d like to be remembered,” Alfonso said Sunday.
Alfonso, who served under three gov-
ernors, was a founding trustee in 2001 and was elected chairman last year. He said he didn’t have any prior indication that the governor would not renew his 
appointment.
UF President Ber-
nie Machen released a statement Friday afternoon wishing Al-fonso well and noting the highlights of his 11 years on the board.
“He was instru-
mental in many of the 
university’s greatest achievements dur-ing that period, including our increased tuition ﬂ  exibility, signiﬁ  cant progress in innovation and the rapid growth of our campus research infrastructure,” he said.
Alfonso, a UF graduate, said he has 
no plans to continue his involvement with higher education in Florida. He has a family and is a prominent architect in Tampa. He said it would be nice, after 11 years, to take a break.
However, Alfonso added, he loves UF 
and will always pay attention to what’s going on at the university.
“I think it’s part of my DNA,” he 
said.

About 3,000 people gathered on 
Flavet Field on Saturday evening for 
Student Government Productions’ first Swampfest.
Mac Miller, Rooney, Tokyo Police 
Club and RAC performed despite heavy rain.
SGP paid Mac Miller $45,000; 
Tokyo Police Club $35,000; Rooney $17,500; and RAC $10,000.
Jeff Schnier, chairman of SGP , said 
VISA and Reitz Union Board Enter -
tainment also helped plan the festi-val.
“These bands are really chill,” the 
22-year-old accounting senior said. “They were chosen for that reason.”
The last major concert held at Fla-
vet was a 2010 Slightly Stoopid show, but it was cut short after the crowd grew aggressive.
Student Government spent $35,000 
on safety improvements to the band shell after that.
Police weren’t worried about 
Swampfest.
“Number one, this is a totally dif-
ferent genre,” said UPD Lt. William Gainey, who said he expected a laid-back crowd.
Thunder caused the show to be 
postponed at about 4:45 p.m., about the same time UF students Taylor Lil-ley, 18, and Brittany Yates, 19, arrived.“I think we saw about six people,” 
said Lilley, a natural resource conser -
vation freshman.
UPD gave the go-ahead at about 
5:30 p.m. A group of about 50 gath-ered, some huddled under umbrellas while others stood soaking in the rain. The weather cleared by about 7:30 p.m.
The crowd had reached about 
2,500 people when Mac Miller took the stage at about 9 p.m.Miller met briefly with Brian Auti-
eri, 20, and another UF student after the show. Both won a meet-and-greet through SGP’s Facebook page.
Autieri’s birthday was the day be-
fore the concert, and he said this was one of the best presents he’s ever got-ten.
“I was so stoked,” the philosophy 
sophomore said.

April 22, 1980: UF police evacuate all floors except 
the ground floor of the Reitz Union after a threat of 
“disturbance” during a speech by Israeli Bible teacher Yitzhak Yitzhaki. A paper with “One kilowatt wide” and the date written on it was found in a box under the podium in the Rion Ballroom.
April 22, 1985: Graduate assistants have a new 
contract that includes a 6.5-percent pay increase and overtime procedures. The average graduate assistant earns about $5,500 per year for teaching 10 to 20 hours a week. Ralph Turlington said that while some assis-tants work more hours than they are contracted for, it is difficult to say they are “overworked” because each person has different out-of-class habits.
April 25, 1989: A new cable channel that broad-
casts news in foreign languages is introduced for in-ternational students and students taking foreign-lan-guage classes. “I’ve taken three years of Russian, and this is the only oral experience I get,” said UF student Steve Kraus.
April 23, 2003: The University Writing Program is 
created to standardize courses critical to professional development. The program plans to expand during the next five years to include graduate courses, un-dergraduate disciplinary writing courses and faculty workshops. Students will be able to try the classes this year, but eventually they will be required to take a writing course at UF before graduating. This pro-gram is separate from the English department.
April 26, 2006: Student Government uses $6,278 of 
students’ tuition to fund the SG end-of-the-year ban-quet. To cover the additional costs for the banquet, organizers used both outside revenue and student money designated for SG elections. Items purchased for the banquet include a $350 chocolate fountain, $625 round table linens and $666 chocolate gators.

When Terry Sullivan woke up 
Friday morning, he was optimistic. 
He was going to look for a job early in the day and then watch his sister get married.
Sullivan, 28, said he worked as 
a driver for Nationwide Insurance until he was ﬁ  red on April 16. On Friday morning, he applied at Mis-ter Paper Ofﬁ  ce Supply and Molly and Friends Premium Handmade Cat Furniture.
He stopped by his home in Ar-
bor Park apartments, then drove to the courthouse to watch his sister get married. He arrived too late. At about 10:30 a.m., about ﬁ  ve minutes after he showed up at the court-house, Sullivan received a call: His apartment was on ﬁ  re.
The cause of the ﬁ  re at 309 SW 
16th Ave. was unknown late Friday , said Gainesville Fire Rescue District Chief Pat Lewis. Two neighbors had to leave their apartments on ladders from their windows, and ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters rescued several dogs.
Lewis said the department re-
ceived a call about the ﬁ  re at about 10 a.m. The Red Cross was called to the complex to help people living in apartments damaged by the ﬁ  re.
Sullivan said the ﬁ  re couldn’t 
have started at the stove. It just couldn’t have. He moved the stove this morning when he dropped a $5 bill, but he double-checked the whole apartment before he left. Elec-tronics, lights, appliances — they were all off, he said.“I lost everything,” he said, sit-
ting by a curb in the apartment com-plex. “Baby clothes, my ﬂ  at-screen TV . I lost everything. It’s kind of hard to explain. … What a bad way to end the week.”
He lived at the apartment with 
his wife, Danielle, and two sons, but nobody was home when the ﬁ  re started. Danielle was at work, he said. His 9-month-old was with Terry’s mother, and his 3-year-old was at Sidney Lanier School.
Matthew Horler, 24, stood on the 
curb near Sullivan on Friday morn-ing wearing a red robe and black sneakers. Horler said he moved into the apartment a few weeks ago.
He works the graveyard shift at 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce’s Combined Communications Center, where co-workers often receive calls from people reporting ﬁ  res like the one at Arbor Park.
He was preparing for bed when 
he smelled smoke. He checked his kitchen. Nothing. Then, he opened his front door and craned his neck into the hall.
“It was like staring in ink,” he 
said. “Couldn’t see a thing.”
He heard ﬁ  re trucks, so he opened 
his living room window and yelled. A ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter came with a ladder.
Tural Akhmedov , a 23-year-old 
chemistry graduate student at UF, also needed a ladder to escape. He was sleeping when he heard his ﬁ  re alarm screech Friday morning. He thought it a mistake. He unhooked the alarm and hopped back in bed.
About ﬁ  ve minutes later, he said, 
the alarm went off again. He doesn’t know how. This time, he heard ﬁ  re-ﬁ  ghters. He opened his bedroom door and was greeted by thick fog.
Fireﬁ  ghters broke his window 
and stuck a ladder inside, and he climbed down. Neither Horler nor Akhmedov was injured.
Back on the curb, Sullivan kept 
thinking about what was gone. No clothes. No money. No food — they just bought groceries, he said.
“I know I didn’t leave the stove 
on,” he said. “I know I didn’t. I know I didn’t leave the burners on. I know. I know.”
As he sat, Sullivan held the sides of his head. He kept his eyes toward the ground, toward his high-top Chuck Taylors.
They had ﬂ  ames painted on 
them.

Alachua County Fire Rescue workers attempt to free Louis M. Penque Jr. from his car late Saturday. A witness 
said Penque attempted to pass her while traveling about 70 to 80 mph on Southwest 62nd Street.
Crash occurred at Fairmont 
Oaks apartments entrance
right, the car rolled down a ditch. It 
dragged forward against the grass. Then it hit a bump and caught air.
The car crashed into the palm 
tree at the entrance of Fairmont Oaks. The tree split in the middle. The passenger’s side of the Sable ripped open.
“If someone were on the other 
side of the car, he would have been dead,” said GPD Sgt. David Bliz-zard.
Tony McCloud, 24, was at Hamp-
ton Oaks Apartments, about a quar -
ter mile north of the crash, when it happened. It sounded like a bomb, he said.
After the crash, Hooker said 
she checked on Penque. He leaned against the tree trunk, which now jutted between the driver’s and pas-senger’s front seats. He was laugh-ing.Penque asked for his iPhone, 
which lay on the road next to the wrecked car. Hooker handed it to him, thinking he would call 911. In-stead, he snapped pictures of him-self. When officers arrived, Hooker said, he threw the phone at one of them.
After a rescue team freed Penque, 
he stood, laughing. A group of about 15 watched from a ditch next to the crash, conflicted about the proper re-sponse. Some laughed. Others asked if they should cheer. Paramedics carted him to an ambulance.
An hour later, the top half of the 
palm tree stretched across the exit of Fairmont Oaks. Glass sprinkled the road. Other parts of the Sable were spread throughout the entrance.
Then there was the car’s license 
plate. It was a vanity plate. Proceeds went to the Police Benevolent Asso-ciation.

ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM.
SUMMER BENSON

In the sea of more than 50,000 stu-
dents at UF, five students are enrolled in 
a unique program very few universities have access to.
UF’s Master of Fine Arts lighting de-
sign program is one of just a handful of universities that looks at lighting as a technique to be used beyond the theater stage, said third-year MFA lighting de-sign student Bryan Lussier.
“There are a lot of programs that fo-
cus on theater and only theater,” said Lussier, 28. “What makes UF’s program very unique is that we’re involved in the museum lighting, we’re involved with architectural lighting.”
Essentially , UF examines the next 
step of lighting, which makes people think about the environments they’re in, Lussier said.
The program is headed by professor 
Stan Kaye, whose background spans more than 30 years of experience in both academia and the lighting industry.
The aim of the program is to bring 
theater lighting to the masses while maintaining a focus on the fundamentals of lighting design.
Students in the three-year program 
practice lighting design in a variety of settings in order to gain experience out-side of theater production.
Several students recently worked 
with Kaye and Luxam’s lighting compa-ny to develop and install a customized lighting system in the new Cofrin Asian Art Wing at the Samuel P . Harn Museum of Art.
“We look at how science and art work 
so we can try to understand how our art is interpreted by the population,” Lus-sier said.
He said the program is about push-
ing the art forward in an age when peo-ple are constantly looking down at their phones instead of looking at the world around them.
“When we talk about innovation, en-
trepreneurship, international work and the fusion of art and science and technol-ogy, this is it,” Kaye said.UF lighting design program

Eight months of 13 Santa Fe College stu-
dents’ hard work went up in the air Sunday 
morning. That’s exactly where they wanted it.
“We were screaming, jumping up and 
down, and then we realized, ‘Oh, wait — we have to wait for it to come down safely,’” said LaNiece O’Steen, 27, an engineering student and president of Santa Fe College’s Engineer -
ing Club.
The Gainesville group joined 41 other 
teams in Huntsville, Ala., for NASA’s Uni-versity Student Launch Initiative. The com-petition encourages students to design, build and launch a reusable rocket, according to its website.
Participating universities included UF, 
Pennsylvania State University and the Univer -
sity of Notre Dame. This was Santa Fe’s first year competing.
“A lot of people don’t really see us as com-
petition when it comes to things like this,” O’Steen said. “So it’s really fun to get to work with [them] and to get to interact with the other teams.”
The Santa Fe team consisted of 13 students, 
two advisers and one mentor. They wrote a proposal last fall and were accepted.
Since then, the team has been passing mile-stones such as a preliminary design review and a flight readiness review. They created more than 500 pages of documents. NASA en-gineers reviewed their plans via video confer -
ence, O’Steen said.
The final product was a 9-foot-8 rocket 
weighing 37.8 pounds. A graphic that looked like water wrapped around its bottom half, fading into white and displaying the Santa Fe logo.
The launch went well, said Jimmy Yawn, 
the team’s mentor. To see it in the air was a relief because there were so many aspects that could have gone wrong, he said.
“The flight was just about perfect,” Yawn 
said.
The team’s rocket didn’t reach the required 
one-mile height. It fell about 700 feet short at 4,539 feet, O’Steen said.
The Santa Fe students hope to return next 
year anyway. O’Steen said the growth of the team since August has been amazing. Yawn echoed that statement.
“Every one of them is smarter than I am,” 
he said, “but I try not to let on.”

Friends of the Library Book Sale, 
people flooded the warehouse car -
rying empty cardboard boxes.
Soon, they had to side-step 
through aisles, and many reached over their neighbors’ shoulders to-ward shelves packed with books.About 750 people waited out-
side the Friends of the Library’s book warehouse at 430 N. Main St. Saturday morning for its biannual book sale. The sale will go through Wednesday.
Sarah Harrison, publicity chair 
for Alachua County Friends of the Library, said opening day is always the busiest.
“They start lining up from Thurs-day evening,” Harrison said. “At 10 this morning, you couldn’t walk in here.”
The first Friends of the Library 
book sale held in 1954 raised $80. Harrison said Friends of the Library now makes between $140,000 and $160,000 through the five-day sale.
Ann Hemme, co-chairwoman of 
the book sale, said the organization raised about $110,000 during Satur -day and Sunday’s sale.
“It’s the largest book sale in the 
Southeast,” Harrison said. “It’s re-ally sort of a phenomenon.”
Harrison said the sale typically 
has about 500,000 items, including books, magazines and records.
Hemme said the number of items 
dropped a bit from last semester’s sale.
Sarah Yost, a 24-year-old book 
sale volunteer, said her parents have been volunteering with the book sale for 25 years, and they often brought Yost and her two younger brothers to the sale.
“We used to sit cross-legged un-
derneath the table and read Betty and V eronica comics,” Yost said. “Loving books is kinda more in my blood.”
Jamie Fisher, a 20-year-old Chi-
nese and linguistics sophomore at UF, said she enjoys the cheap prices, but the unexpected nature of the book sale is what keeps her coming back year after year.
“You come not knowing what 
you’re going to get,” Fisher said.
Biannual book sale draws hundreds to Saturday opening
The sale will run through Wednesday
“The flight was just about perfect.”

Today’s question: Did you go to Swampfest? 
305 TOTAL VOTES52% YES
48% NOFriday’s question: Have you ever had sex 
on campus? Campaign Conundrum
How SG election 
codes can be fixed
Last week, the UF Supreme Court ruled that the SG 
election codes do not prevent campaign-like activities throughout the year.
The code in question states, “Campaigning begins on the 
first day of the active election cycle.”
On Thursday, we discussed the implications for student free 
speech if this code were interpreted to mean that campaigning could only occur during the brief election cycle leading up to each election.
Fortunately, the UF Supreme Court clarified this rule in fa-
vor of student free speech. However, the Student Senate also has the chance to clarify these codes in the upcoming months.
We strongly advise the Senate to not amend the codes to re-
strict campaign activity during off-election periods for reasons given in our editorial last week.
We also advise the Student Senate to amend code 762.0, 
which requires that all campaign material have the label “Reg-istered Political Advertisement.”
First, we believe this code is way too proactive. By this, we 
mean that the code is attempting to remedy a problem that may not even exist.
The code seeks to prevent the distribution of fraudulent 
campaign material by ensuring that the material has been ap-proved by someone in each party and registered as official campaign material with the Supervisor of Elections.
However, election codes 762.11, 762.12 and 762.13 already 
prohibit misrepresentations of facts and falsely attributed ma-terial to candidates or parties who did not authorize that mate-rial.
Therefore, we believe the codes that govern the election 
process should be retroactive. In other words, code violations involving the distribution of false information should only be addressed when they occur.
This does not mean that candidates and parties cannot still 
oversee and approve materials promoting their candidates or their party.
However, it prevents the Elections Commission from giving 
code violations to candidates or parties for forgetting to put “Reg. Pol. Ad.” in a Facebook post about the election.
Essentially, we propose that code 762.0 be removed from 
the election codes to let the parties self-regulate their campaign material.
If one party charges another with the distribution of false 
material, the problem can be solved through hearings and, if need be, a ruling by the UF Supreme Court.
We also want to remind members of SG that there is not only 
an Elections Commission to address these sorts of disputes, but there is also a press that can bring to light any misrepresenta-tions and false materials distributed by either party.
Those running for office also have access to the Internet to 
help address possible falsifications.
While being proactive in preventing fraud sounds like a no-
ble cause, the costs to student free speech during SG elections greatly outweigh the benefits of this type of rule.Now’s the time to find your passion
During my four years at UF, I’ve learned that if you 
find a passion, learn how to fail and surround yourself with the best people, you will set yourself 
up for an unforgettable college journey that will set you up for success in life.
When I got to UF, I was passionate about political sci-
ence — or so I thought. I was in denial that the lack of any numbers in my class bothered me, but I still enjoyed talk-ing about political issues, so I switched to economics. I have tried to be passionate about many subjects that I’ve merely liked, but you can’t fake it to yourself forever.
There is a giant gap between passion and drive, and 
when I realized that drive was what was getting me through most of my higher-level math classes on the way to graduate school, I stopped and changed course even though I had no idea which way to go. After walking around in Library West and picking out interesting books from the shelves, I discovered that I was seriously in love with investing and personal finance. If you aren’t reading articles from your major just for fun and for the pure en-joyment of learning more, you are in the wrong major and should change now.
Please do not waste time pretending that biology is your 
long-lost love or that you were meant to write journal ar -
ticles because that’s what successful people do. Find what you like to learn about, and don’t settle for anything less.
Failure has been a major theme in my UF career. We 
need to stop thinking about failure as a terrible thing. Fail-ure can be productive: You either overcome it or redirect your course. In high school, I did really well because it was a protected and structured world with controllable vari-ables and predictable outcomes. All of a sudden, I was at a university with 50,000 people and had no one to compete against but myself. After going through a half-dozen career paths in my head, I finally found a great job at an invest-ment company. A major reason why I finally found some-thing exciting is that I applied for countless scholarships, internships, grad programs and funded travel that rejected me. Please don’t be afraid of rejec-tion. It’s not fun to fail, but in the real world you will have plenty of successes and failures; hav-ing a high volume of rejections just means you are spinning the wheels of thought and opening yourself up to lots of great op-
portunities. Please apply for that program or job you are thinking about right now.
You should also shoot to surround yourself with people 
who are honest, wholesome and smart. If you look for the group that will go to Grog with you every night drinking, you will leave UF with little to talk about except stories about alcohol. There’s a lot to be said for having a great time with friends and having some beers, but don’t let the worst parts of UF’s culture consume you. When you party, if you’re still able to talk about something from class or an interesting story in the news, you’ve found a great group of people that are actually interested in you. The top stu-dents here are every bit as good as those anywhere in the country, so choose wisely.
I am so proud that I will be able to say very soon that 
I’m a graduate of UF. I’ve been sheltered from the harsh realities of the world for the past four years and am about to roll into full gear. I’ve been given the opportunity of a lifetime by being able to graduate with an awesome educa-tion from inside and outside the classroom.
Cherish your time at UF. Don’t be afraid to search for 
what keeps you up late at night thinking, and don’t worry about failing a bunch on the way there. With good people by your side, you’ll go far.

University should have stepped up 
after death of student
This is a call to the UF president, pro-
vost and dean of students.
I’m severely disappointed in how the 
university dealt the recent death of Mi-chael R. Edmonds Jr.
As the news broke, I sat in my resi-
dence hall refreshing Twitter feeds to verify the rumored death. The awful news led to a conversation with a fellow student.
We spoke about being a part of a pres-
tigious university that holds its morals to high standards (seen in the fast response to hazing earlier in the semester). We just knew that we were going to receive some sort of ofﬁ  cial communication in the fol-lowing hours, afﬁ  rming that the univer-sity saw this as an important issue that emotionally affected a lot of students, even if they didn’t personally know Mi-chael. But the email never came.
UF has to be a stronger force against 
the thoughts or actions of suicide. The failure to communicate the news from the university’s point of view takes away from the gravity of the issue at hand. A student with suicidal thoughts might feel as though his or her suicide would also go unmentioned as this one did.
There exists a divide between students 
who believe this happens all the time and those who believe it rarely happens. This is why I feel that the university needs to address student suicides with as much urgency as any other threat to student safety.

Before signing any petition or show-
ing up to any rallies during the next few weeks, inform yourself. People 
throughout UF are wasting too much effort in fruitless endeavors.
Yes, UF is facing a budget cut that will 
affect some departments, faculty and staff. Tuition will likely continue to increase to-ward the national average. Despite the great uncertainty surrounding the administra-tion’s decisions, you can still do something, though it will take more than a Facebook post or a signature on a petition. There are many things at stake in these last weeks of the semester: the quality of your education, your career prospects and the livelihood of your faculty and staff. 
Half-baked attempts to mobilize the Stu-
dent Body will do more harm than good for what could be (and should be) an impor-tant movement against political meddling in our university system. There is no “ﬂ  ag-ship” department at UF. There is no point in jumping the gun before proposed cuts are announced. There is no sense in putting out incomplete information that will misinform and fractionalize student support.
What we need is a coordinated effort 
among the students and departments, the involvement of parents and supporters of the university and the attention of the media and state representatives. We have organiza-tions capable of such coordination. Let’s put them to use and create a solid movement.
First and foremost, the faculty and the 
Student Body need to realize that their ef-forts should be directed toward Florida politicians. This budget cut has been handed down with little or no input from UF faculty, staff and administration — partisan politics is responsible for the cuts. The administra-tion can mitigate some of the im-pact by “trim-ming the fat” in 
a few areas, but it cannot seize many of the daily operations or contractual obligations it has.
There is little “fat” in this university. All 
efforts to make it leaner will ultimately fall short of meeting the budget cut, primarily because there really is little to cut, but also because the immediate actions that can be undertaken will have little impact; some of the actions that could have greater impact will not produce effects until next year.
Administrators face the most difﬁ  cult 
task of all: keeping the university running while trying to protect every job they can. It is not as simple as cutting back on land-scaping to save a handful of staff positions. It is true that some departments have more staff and service fewer students while others teach more classes but produce less research. How does one assess the value of a depart-ment, faculty member or staff member uni-formly? There are very tough choices to be made in the coming days and the faculty , staff and administrators have been deliber-ating for weeks, if not months, on what to cut and from where to cut it. The Student Body should give credit where credit is due and place blame where it truly belongs.
Everyone in the state of Florida needs 
to realize that this is not a “public” univer-sity, per se. UF receives 20 to 25 percent of its budget from the state, despite being its “ﬂ  agship” university; the rest comes from private sources.
One would understand the lack of over-
sight if the majority of the funding came from the state, but it is ridiculous to think partisan politics are affecting university op-erations under the current budget allocation. Administrators could explore the options of making the university a fully private entity to untether it from unjust political oversight, but the South needs another Harvard like Florida needs a polytechnic university.
Parents and students are the ones caught 
between a rock and a hard place in this sce-nario because privatizing the university would incur greater tuition increases despite the ability to attract better professors and at-tain higher national standing and prestige. The solution is to kick politics out of higher education.
On one hand, it is too late to do anything 
about the state budget — it has already passed. On the other, it is never too late to do the right thing. Faculty should teach the courses that are most in demand so the uni-versity can maximize the state credit it mer-its. Administrators should seek innovative funding strategies to wean the university off state support. Students should organize a massive letter-writing campaign targeting their local representatives and Gov. Scott to tell them that, despite party lines, you will not vote for them until they return control of the university to our administrators by restoring the budget allocation.
Remind them Florida is always a swing 
state and presidential elections are right around the corner. Citizens control politics by making politicians accountable for deci-sions through the power of the vote. Let’s send them a clear message: Meddle in our future by trying to alter our education, and we will meddle in yours during the next election.

For a brief time Sunday, Geor -
gia looked like it might actually 
beat Florida. 
Even after the Gators won the 
doubles point and the first singles point, the Bulldogs took the first set on four of the remaining five singles courts. All they had to do was hold on.
They didn’t, and the Gators 
(21-1) came up with clutch points all over the court en route to their third straight Southeastern Con-ference championship, defeating the No. 7 Bulldogs 4-1.
“It feels great, and in particu-
lar because of the match we just played,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “That was the SEC’s finest right there, the two best teams in the league without a doubt. It was high-level tennis from start to fin-ish. I think once again our fitness proved to perhaps make a little bit of a difference.”
After Joanna Mather defeated Georgia’s Nadja Gilchrist 6-4, 6-4, the Gators took a 2-0 lead in the match. But four Gators dropped their first sets, including both No. 1 Allie Will and No. 10 Lauren Embree. Holding all four leads would have given the Bulldogs (21-4) the win, but the two-time defending conference champions fought back.
Especially impressive was 
Embree, who won her second set against No. 7 Chelsey Gullickson, a player who has given Florida fits in the past. In the decisive third set, down 4-3, Embree was able to break Gullickson twice to tie the set at five. The junior then put her foot down, winning the final two games to win the set and the match, giving Florida a 3-1 lead.
“It’s a testament to our play-
ers to have the fitness to be able to compete for four hours and then continue to make good decisions and put the ball where it needs to be at the end of these three-set matches,” Thornqvist said.
After that, it was up to junior 
Caroline Hitimana to hold her third-set lead. She did, winning 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 to clinch the match and the championship for the Gators. It was the third straight and eighth in 10 years for the most dominant program in SEC wom-en’s tennis history. The Gators have won the SEC Tournament 18

It was an even more daunting 
task the second time around, but the 
Gators found a way again.
A year and a week after upset-
ting Northwestern to take its first American Lacrosse Conference regu-lar season championship, Florida did it again by winning somewhere not many other teams do.
The No. 5 Gators (15-2, 5-0 ALC) 
defeated the top-ranked Wildcats (14-1, 4-1 ALC) 8-7 on Saturday at Lakeside Field in Evanston Ill., snap-ping the Wildcats’ 20-game  home winning streak. Northwestern’s last loss at home came during the 2010 season, when it fell 18-16 to North Carolina.
“It’s a great confidence booster,” 
coach Amanda O’Leary said. “They’re a tough team to beat at home. On the 
road at their place it’s even more difficult.”
It was 
Northwestern’s first loss to an ALC opponent in Evanston since March 23, 2003, when it lost to Ohio State 14-4. Dating back to 2005, Northwest-ern has just three losses to conference opponents. Two of them have come against Florida.

Despite the Gators’ heartbreaking loss to 
Alabama at the Super Six, they found some 
redemption this weekend in Kytra Hunter. 
The freshman became Florida’s second 
consecutive NCAA Vault Champion after averaging a 9.875 on two routines at the in-dividual event finals on Sunday in The Arena at Gwinnett Center in Duluth, Ga. 
Last year, Marissa King won with the 
same average. Hunter’s win is the fourth in UF history, as Susan Hines claimed the vault title in both 1997 and 1998. 
Hunter earned a 9.95 for her more difficult 
Yurchenko one and a half — the vault she’s competed all season — on her first routine. On her second vault (9.8), she had trouble perfecting a Yurchenko full, which requires a back handspring with a full twist onto the table. 
Regardless, both scores were enough to 
give Hunter the vault win. “I don’t train it at all,” Hunter said. “But 
in the last week, we’ve been doing one or two. I’m really scared of that (Yurchenko full) vault. I just went out there and did whatever I could — just glad that I could win first place.”
The vault title wasn’t the only individual 
championship Hunter earned this weekend. 
At the evening session of semifinals on Friday, Hunt-er picked up the NCAA all-
around title with a 39.725, becoming the first Gator ever to do so. 
“For her to come away 
with the vault title is really something special for her 
to add to her all-around title,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “She went out there and did ex-actly what she wanted to do in one vault. Her first vault was gorgeous once again and then for her to come out and do the second Hunter wins vault title, Florida

After the match, Embree and Mather were 
named to the all-tournament team. Mather 
was named tournament MVP after going 3-0 and getting the first singles point in the cham-pionship on Sunday.
“It is an honor. There are great players in 
the SEC, and I think a lot of girls deserve it on my team too. It’s a great honor,” she said. 
“It’s so nice to do this my senior year, to 
come out and win it. It was so close. It looked like it could go either way. Georgia played a really great match, and we’re so excited we came out with the win.” 
The No. 10 men lost Saturday in the SEC 
tournament semifinal to Mississippi. The Gators lost the doubles point and never recov-ered, ending their run at the tournament with a 4-1 defeat. The lone victory of the afternoon was by Tripper Carleton, who in 7-6 (7-1), 6-3. Now, the Gators must wait to hear their seed-ing for next month’s NCAA tournament. 14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 23, 2012

Florida attacker Gabi Wiegand drives between two defenders in a game against Vanderbilt on April 
14.  Wiegand scored the game-winning goal in Florida’s 8-7 win over Northwestern on Saturday.
Teams could meet again in 
ALC Tournament this week
finished with a game-high four 
points (two goals, two assists).
“It’s amazing,” Wiegand said. 
“I’ve never experienced anything like that.”
Junior defender Sam Farrell said 
it helped that the Gators had previ-ous experience against the Wildcats.
“We’re pretty familiar with them,” 
Farrell said.  “We watched a lot of film on them and we really scouted them out well.”
With the game tied at seven and 
both teams in a 14-minute scoring drought, Wiegand was awarded a free-position shot after getting fouled on a cut to the net. 
She missed the shot, but the 
Gators retained possession. On the ensuing play, Wiegand beat Wild-cats midfielder Ali Cassera with a cut to the right and put a shot over the right shoulder of goalkeeper Brianne LoManto to put Florida up 8-7 with 5:47 remaining in the game.
“The defender was giving me a lot 
of space so I just took my opportuni-ty and looked to see where the goalie was and just took my shot,” Wiegand said. The Florida defense did not sur -
render a shot on goal the rest of the game. 
The Wildcats were limited in 
large part because their leading scor -
er, 2011 Tewaaraton Award Win-ner Shannon Smith, was held to just 
two goals on eight shots.
O’Leary was 
happy to see such a stifling defensive performance from her team in the big-gest game of the season.
“Northwestern is the who’s 
who of women’s lacrosse players,” O’Leary said. “Thank goodness [the Gators] played their best defensive game.”
Saturday’s win guaranteed Flori-
da the top seed and a first-round bye in this year’s conference tournament, which begins in Gainesville on May 3. The Gators play their first game on May 4 against the lowest-seeded team remaining.

Hunter tied for fourth on floor exercise Sunday 
with a 9.925 and junior Ashanée Dickerson shared sixth (9.9). 
Despite a groin pull, which limited her in train-
ing after regionals, King placed fifth on vault (9.788). The first vaults the junior practiced since regionals were during Thursday’s training session.
“It was a little bit tough,” King said. “I landed a 
little bit low, but I had fun and it was great coming out here to compete.”
On uneven bars, sophomore Mackenzie Caquat-
to came in sixth (9.825), while sophomore Alaina Johnson struggled, placing eighth (9.488).
Georgia’s Kat Ding won the bars (9.988) and 
floor titles (9.95), and Alabama’s Geralen Stack-Eaton snagged the balance beam win with a 9.938. Alabama’s Diandra Milliner was the vault runner-up with a 9.825.
On Saturday, No. 1 seed Florida suffered a 
stunning defeat to fourth-seeded Alabama in the Super Six. The Crimson Tide (197.85) rallied past the Gators (197.775) after their last beam routine to win a second-straight national championship. The Tide’s .075-point margin of victory was the slim-mest at the Super Six since Utah defeated Alabama by .05 in 1994.  
Despite falling short, UF’s runner-up finish is 
the team’s first since 1998 and second of all time.  
Florida left Duluth with a gem in Hunter, but 
will have to look to the future to claim the elusive national title it came so close to capturing. 
“This meet went well for us. We put our heart 
out there and did the best we could,” Hunter said. “We were so close. After a little break, when we do go back into the gym, we’ll be working harder and trying new things. We have a great freshman class coming in. 
“We do lose three seniors, but the majority of the 
team is back.”GYM , from page 13

Florida outfielder Daniel Pigott pumps his fist as he rounds second base 
following his three-run home run in the sixth inning of Sunday’s win.
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
Florida had just fallen behind 
3-2 and was in need of a big sixth 
inning. Daniel Pigott ripped an 0-1 fastball that sent Georgia right fielder Kevin Ruiz crashing into the outfield wall and landing with an empty glove. 
Pigott’s fifth home run of the 
year plated Preston Tucker and Mike Zunino, giving the No. 5 Gators (31-9, 11-7 Southeastern Conference) a 6-3 lead, the game’s eventual final score. 
“We needed that,” Pigott said. 
“The momentum had shifted their way. We really needed to get back and answer them and we did.”
It was an old-fashioned, Sun-
day afternoon bullpen duel. Junior Hudson Randall started for the Gators for the first time in more than three weeks, and freshman Luke Crumley got his first career start for the Bulldogs (24-17, 8-10 SEC). Both were pulled after three innings with pitch counts in the 40s. 
Florida led 1-0 when both man-
agers started going to the bullpen. The lone run was a Mike Zunino leadoff homer in the second. For the next three innings, things were dicey. 
Brett DeLoach hit a double off 
of Randall before UF’s starter ex-ited the game. Sophomore left-hander Daniel Gibson then faced three batters and gave up two RBI doubles. 
The Gators bounced back 
thanks to Pigott, who finished the game 3 for 3 and the series 7 for 12. His RBI double in the fourth scored designated hitter Brian Johnson. 
“He has days like this where 
he sees the ball really good,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
Greg Lar -
son, Steven “Paco” Ro-driguez and 
Austin “Mud Dog” Maddox saved the day once again. The trio threw a combined 11.2 innings Friday night but bounced back to kill five frames on Sunday. 
Larson threw 2.1 innings of one-
run and one-hit ball. Rodriguez and Maddox worked the game’s final 2.2 innings, allowing no hits and striking out four. Rodriguez struck out the side in the eighth – all looking. 
“After [Saturday’s] loss, me and 
Mud were like, ‘We’ve got to go out there and give them a show,’” Rodriguez said. “We basically did that.”Squeezed in all of this was a 
brief outing for sophomore Karsten Whitson, his second career relief appearance. Whitson faced five batters but was pulled after allow-ing two hits on 20 pitches. Rodri-guez cleaned up the jam. 
Georgia’s bullpen struggled. 
Jay Swinford and Bryan Benzor followed Crumley to the mound. Florida got just one run off Swin-ford in two innings but feasted on Benzor. The junior right-hander faced five batters, recorded one out and surrendered four earned runs. 
“Any time you get a chance to 
have a big inning, you’ve got to take advantage of it,” Pigott said.
It was Florida’s second consecu-
tive SEC series win after dropping back-to-back series to Ole Miss and LSU. 
Friday night’s game was a 
16-inning marathon that fell just four minutes shy of five hours. UF won 3-2 when Vickash Ramjit scored the game-winning run after Nolan Fontana struck out swing-ing on a ball in the dirt but reached first base on an errant throw by catcher Brandon Stephens. 
The Bulldogs held the Gators 
hitless for the final five innings of Saturday’s game, winning 5-3.
Florida is now two games be-
hind Kentucky in the SEC. The Wildcats took two of three from LSU this weekend.
Pigott’s homer lifts Gators over ‘Dawgs
Since January , when it really hit me that 
this was my last semester, I have stewed over what I wanted to say with my final 
column for the Alligator.  Without a doubt, it has been the hardest assignment in five years of college. 
For the last week I’ve stared at a blank doc-
ument on my laptop, the cursor mockingly flashing at me, daring me to get this over with. Then Friday night at McKethan Stadium, in-spiration struck when I least expected, during what I thought would be a pedestrian series opener for the Gators.
Florida beat Georgia 3-2 in a 16-inning 
marathon that started early Friday evening and lasted until just after midnight Saturday . It ended on, of all things, a walkoff strikeout.
I’m still trying to fully grasp what hap-
pened as the clock ticked past midnight at The Mac. I’ve witnessed plenty of walkoffs, even a few walkoff walks, but I never thought I’d see a walkoff strikeout, let alone cover one.As Florida rushed the field and mobbed 
Nolan Fontana on the infield dirt, basking in the glory of a physically and mentally taxing, 16-inning epic, my attention drifted from the celebration on the field to the agony just off it, near Georgia’s dugout, where catcher Bran-don Stephens collapsed to his knees, his team-mates picking him back up, trying to console him after he threw away what was probably the most memorable game he has ever been a part of.
That’s when I realized what Friday’s game 
really was. It was emotional. It was unpredict-able. It was awesome, and it was absurd. It was everything that’s great about sports, and it’s why I’m glad I chose this as my career path.
As trivial as sports are, they represent ev-
erything that’s great about human nature. Fri-day’s game illustrated that to me more than ever.
I’ve witnessed the highs, like watching as 
a team rallies for a Southeastern Conference title. The lows, like listening intently as a Major Leaguer open-ly contemplates re-tirement while toiling away in the minors at age 25. And plenty in between, like the spectrum of Friday’s 
game showed.
As my two and a half years at the Alligator 
end this week and I move on to hopefully big-ger (though I can’t imagine they will be better) things, I look back on all of that in-between — those games, those interviews, those stories — and realize this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
In two weeks that life will take me away 
from Gainesville, where I’ve spent the last five years, and away from the Alligator, where I’ve poured in countless hours and created even more memories during the latter half of my college career.
The people I met while working here are 
some of my closest friends and they made these last two and a half years worth it.
Bobby and Mike: Thanks for believing in 
me and giving me my first opportunity. 
Chiang, Adam, Holt, Greg, Joe, Tyler, 
Corey , Watts and Boothe: Thanks for making this job seem like anything but that. 
Thanks to my parents for their unrelenting 
support, especially my mom, who never hesi-tated to look over one of my stories before I filed it.
And to you, the readers, thanks for picking 
up and reading the paper that I tried to put so much of myself into. I hope that at some point during the last two and a half years I made you think. And I hope you go to a game like Friday’s and stick it out, even in the 16th in-ning.

� WOMEN’S GOLF TEAM FINISHED IN FOURTH.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Writer
 
After both the men’s and women’s golf teams entered the 
final day of their Southeastern Conference tournament in 
fourth place, only the men were able to improve their finish.
The men finished the tournament with a weekend total of 
841 (+1), putting them in third place. Juniors Tyler McCum-ber and T.J. Vogel shot in the red, moving them both to a tie for third individually. 
“I’m proud of my team,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “We battled hard all week and were pretty competitive all weekend. I feel that we have improved immensely from 
where we were at in the fall.” 
McCumber had the more impressive 
round for the Gators on Sunday with a team-high six birdies against a team-low three bogeys. McCumber also had the sec-ond-biggest jump on the leaderboard for the Gators, moving up five spots from a tie for eighth.
“I’m really proud of T.J. and Tyler,” Al-
exander said. “They did what All-Ameri-
cans do, turn things around when they aren’t playing their best and post good numbers for their team.”The difference in bogeys between first-place Alabama 
and Florida was a main factor in UF finishing 13 strokes be-hind. The Gators had seven more bogeys during the three days than the Crimson Tide, in addition to only having five rounds under par in comparison to Alabama’s seven.
“Our improvement has been slow but steady,” Alexander 
said. “We’re getting better and I still think that our best golf is ahead of us.”
Florida’s women’s team was led by freshman Camilla 
Hedberg, who was able to hold onto a sixth-place finish de-spite shooting her worst round of the tournament on Sun-day.
