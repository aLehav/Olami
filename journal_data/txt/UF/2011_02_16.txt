CANTON, Ohio — An Ohio woman has 
said yes to a marriage proposal that arrived 
by bus.
Laura Kalamets looked out a Canton res-
taurant window during a Valentine’s Day lunch with her boyfriend and saw a public bus with an ad on its side that read: “Laura, Will You Marry Me?” 
It was signed “Mark” and included in 
smaller letters the words “and make me the happiest man in the world.”Kalamets says she thought she’d have a 
heart attack.
Mark Rose paid the transit agency $300 
for the special ad and arranged for the bus to be parked in the right spot around noon on Monday.
The Repository newspaper of Canton re-
ports the ad will remain in place for a week.
Now it has the additional message: “She 
said yes.”

For 40 years, local artists have had a home in 
Gainesville. 
The home is mobile, an art gallery that has been moved six times and displayed the work of dozens of artists since it 
was formed in October 1970.
It is a microcosm of North Florida culture, a gallery filled 
with art created by locals and often inspired by local scen-ery. 
This is the Artisans’ Guild Gallery, a shop sandwiched between stores in Millhopper Square Shopping Center on Northwest 16th Boulevard. 
Last October, the guild celebrated its 40th anniversary. It 
has survived the Vietnam War, eight U.S. presidents and the boy-band craze of the 1990s. 
Within the walls of the gallery today, shoppers will find 
the diverse work of the guild’s more than 50 member art-
ists. 
Drawings of cartoon alligators created by debOrah Co-
hen-Crown, who makes her living as an artist, line the back 
of one wall. In the middle of the store, bright shawls crafted by Malgorzata Deyrup, a retired UF chemistry professor, 
hang on a stand.
“We have blown glass. We have metalwork. We have 
stained glass. We have stuffed animals…” Deyrup said. 
“It’s exciting to be in a group like this and show [your work] 
around town and get your name out there.”
The gallery is an artist cooperative, operated by the guild 
members who create the displayed art.
It is a labor of love, held together for 40 years by the com -
mitment of its members.
Few of the original guild members from 
1970 remain. Some have died. Others have 
moved away and could no longer be part of the co-op because it only accepts members 
who live within an hour of the gallery.
Christa Kallenbach, who creates stuffed animals for the 
gallery, joined the guild in 1971 shortly after it was formed. 
Kallenbach often sees people buy her stuffed animals for 
their children or grandchildren.
 She continues to work with the guild because even after 
40 years, she still loves her art. 
“I’d rather do this than my housework,” she said. The co-op has high standards for its members. To become 
a member of the guild, artists must submit their work for review. Only the most skilled and inventive applicants are invited to join.
The gallery is not funded by the government, as some

It may not have gotten a shout-out from 
President Obama, but UF’s supercomputer, 
the Novo-G, can do some things better than China’s celebrated supercomputer.
The Chinese Tianhe-1A was dubbed “the 
world’s fastest computer” during Obama’s State of the Union address. But being No. 1 is relative, said Herman Lam, a UF electrical and computer engineering professor.
“Basically, it depends on how you want to 
rate them,” he said. “There’s not one way to say, ‘This is the best.’”UF’s Novo-G was not included in the inter -
national TOP500 list of supercomputers, a list of the world’s fastest processors, that the Chi-nese computer tops because UF’s computer is a different type.
The Novo-G, which stands for “new green,” 
is smaller and runs on much less power than other supercomputers, Lam said. This makes 
it the computer of choice for space satellites.
What makes the Novo-G different is the 
chips that are used. 
Lam said the engineers can change the 
hardware to fit how the data is calculated in-
stead of the other way around.
The different chips allow for large amounts of data to be processed in a smaller computer, making it a better fit for satellites, he said. 
With the supercomputer inside, the satel-
lite doesn’t have to send massive amounts of raw data to supercomputers on earth. It can process the information itself and send down the results. The Novo-G is also faster at pro-cessing DNA. 
UF’s supercomputer can’t perform certain 
operations as fast as China’s, but it is more compact and can do other operations just as fast.
In an age where the U.S. and China are 
being pitted against each other to determine 
which country will stay ahead, Lam said the 
supercomputers aren’t competing.
But, since both computers were designed 
for different things, both computers have their strengths.
“For certain things, yes, we can do much 
better,” he said.UF supercomputer rivals fastest in the worldNewsLocal

The politics of the Middle East will 
never be the same again.
That’s the message UF history pro-
fessor Matthew Jacobs brought to a 
handful of students and guests, as well 
as an online audience, Tuesday at the 
Emerson Alumni Hall.
The lecture, titled “After Egypt’s 
Days of Rage: U.S. Relations With a Changed Middle East,” is the first in a new lecture series, “Hear and Now—Student Perspective.” 
Sponsored by the UF Alumni As-
sociation, the lectures are designed to help students better understand the 
nuances of current events. Each lecture 
is live-streamed online and is available after at alumni.ufl.edu/outreach.
Jacobs began with a brief overview 
of the Egyptian president’s history and told how Mubarak came to power in 
1981. He showed the ties between the 
U.S. and Mubarak’s government and outlined the political and economic investments of American leaders that could have swayed them to give sup-port.
However, as the protests contin-
ued, it became clear the issue was one 
of democratic freedoms and a people’s 
right to govern, something the U.S. government touts and could use to help improve its image in the region.
“It’s not often that you get the chance 
to hit the reset button,” Jacobs said.
He said the important thing for the 
U.S. to do now is  have a keen sense about its power and resources while showing general support for the civil-
ity of the new government. The U.S., 
he said, should focus less on the nature of emerging political groups and more on supporting the growth of an array of options.
“I think (the Middle East) is al-
ready changed. The question is, ‘How much?’” he said. “Clearly the popula-tions are not going to be cowed as they had been recently. … It’s people who make revolutions and that’s crucial to recognize.”
Erica Ngoenha, a political science 
junior who attended, said she’s been captivated by media reports of the 
revolution and wanted a clearer under -standing of the country’s past, how it 
got here and where it might be going.
She said she hopes our country can 
help them to move forward politically and economically, to help them rebuild and bring back some stability.
“I think it’s great the Egyptian peo-
ple have had their voices heard,” she 
said.4, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2011

There are 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 
and new studies are suggesting we should 
take them down, pass them around and drink to benefit our health. 
Beer may offer various health benefits, in-
cluding lowering the risk of kidney stones, providing micronutrients and aiding in the absorption of heart-healthy antioxidants, ac-
cording to a study in the Winter 2011 edition 
of the American Dietetic Association Times.
Dr. Anne Mathews, research assistant 
scientist in the department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at UF, said research 
on beer shows that its health benefits may be 
similar to wine’s.
Studies have shown that although wine 
is higher in polyphenols, antioxidants that 
prevent cancer and damaged cells by de-
stroying oxidized molecules, 
more polyphenols are ab-sorbed from drinking beer, Mathews said. Moreover, the 
barley and hops used to make beer contain micronutrients that may make it a healthier option compared to wine. 
Lindsey Heller, a 21-year-old senior at 
UF, said she chooses not to drink beer even though she is educated on its health benefits through personal research.
“I could eat a head of broccoli if I really 
wanted health benefits,” Heller said. “I’d rather drink something that I enjoy.”
Mathews said the most important thing to 
remember is that while beer and wine offer 
health benefits, the American Heart Associa-
tion does not recommend adding a drink a day to a person’s diet. 
“I don’t know for sure that there is a 
clear better choice between wine or beer,” Mathews said, “but health benefits of alcohol are no excuse to start drinking more.” Study shows

County Commissioners debated Tues-
day how to respond to the Gainesville 
City Commission’s request to approve projects in unincorporated land between 
Gainesville and Waldo.
The request was related to plans for 
sewer system hookups from a Gainesville 
Regional Utilities line that runs through unincorporated land.
Some county commissioners don’t want 
to let the City Commission take away some of their decision-making power.
“What we’re doing is giving away 
our decision-making process or allowing someone else to make decisions for us, and I don’t think that’s appropriate,” Commis-sioner Susan Baird said. “It’s the City Com-mission that’s holding us hostage.”
Commissioner Rod-
ney Long expressed a 
different sentiment.
“The more people 
who decide on an agree-ment, the better I feel,” Long said.
Long said the same 
debate came up about five years ago when the 
city of Archer decided it would accept com-ments from other entities but would not al-low them to approve or disapprove proj-ects. Commissioners spoke about possibly doing the same but against Gainesville.  
The commission may discuss and make 
a decision Tuesday.Commissioners debate

n SENATORS HELD A MOMENT 
OF SILENCE FOR MICHAEL PIRIE AND GRANT LOCKENBACH.

The Student Senate unanimously 
passed a resolution Tuesday to honor the 
deaths of two UF students killed in a rap-pelling accident over the weekend.
Grant Lockenbach and Michael Pirie 
died of hypothermia on Feb. 12 while rappelling in Ellison’s Cave in Walker County, Ga.
Senators held a moment of silence in 
their honor after the resolution was read by Senate President Ben Meyers. Sen. Cecelia Hardwick, a member of 
the Unite Party, spoke in favor of soft closing for bars in Gainesville, a platform item for the party for next week’s Student Government election.
Soft closing would mean that bars stop 
serving food and drinks at 2 a.m., which is the current closing time, but would make customers leave at 3 a.m.
She said Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles, a member of the Unite Party, has brought the issue to the attention of the Gainesville City Commission.
Charles said she thought soft closing 
would be beneficial to students in the fu-ture. Soft closing would allow more time for people to arrange for rides home.
“It’s a bigger issue than just soft clos-
ing,” she said. “It affects student safety.”Senate honors students

He looked like the same at-large district candidate who had 
come to all the other previous forums. He had the long side-
burns, slicked-back colonial hairstyle and a voice that makes microphones unnecessary.
But those who attended Tuesday’s tea party City Commis-
sion forum didn’t get Richard Selwach.
Instead, they got “Diamond Rick the Pawn Broker.”“You’ve heard about Joe the Plumber, well, I’m Diamond 
Rick the Pawn Broker,” Selwach told the crowd of about 100 at the Gainesville Hotel and Conference Center during his open-ing remarks. “I love Rick Scott ... If you love Rick Scott, you will love Rick Selwach.”
While the other nine commission candidates in attendance 
didn’t go as far as adopting a political alter-ego, each tried to 
flex his fiscal responsibility credentials. Forbidden words such 
as “regulation,” “government” and “taxes” gave way to more choice selections such as “cuts,” “business” and “responsibil-ity.”
Although the candidates have expressed their differences 
in political philosophies throughout the campaign season, they 
shared the sentiment that the city’s government could afford to make cuts and run more efficient-ly.
For some of the candidates present, the ax 
cannot come sooner to the city’s budget.
“Gosh, where to begin?” said at-large candidate Don Marsh 
when asked for specifics on what he would do as a city com-missioner to increase revenues or reduce expenses for the city . Most of the candidates in attendance, including District 3 can-didate Rob Zeller, chose to focus on the latter part of the ques-tion.
“Increase revenue — that means take more money from us, 
and I think we’re tapped out already,” Zeller said.
Other candidates, such as Commissioners Thomas Hawk-
ins and Lauren Poe, chose to center their messages more on responsible growth management than slash-and-cut. Citing how the City Commission has sliced millions of dollars from its budget during his tenure, Poe said that the city, if it subscribed 
to proper growth management, could see favorable economic 
results without having to raise taxes.
“A rising tide lifts all ships,” Poe said.Diamond Rick, however, laid down an ultimatum.“You can’t tax me anymore,” he said. “You’re not going to 
get another dime out of me.”
A key topic at the forum revolved around whether the Re-
gional Transit System needed to be expanded. Candidates op-posing the potential expansion argued that such an expansion, given the current economic climate, would not be in the best interests of the city.
Marsh told of a vacation in Mexico where private minivans, 
not the bus line, made transportation easier. District 2 candi-date Robert Krames made reference to the American Founding Fathers to support his argument against RTS expansion.
Other candidates didn’t view the issue in such terms. Dis-
trict 3 candidate Ozzy Angulo argued that many in his district, such as college students and low-income residents, relied on the bus system to get around.
District 2 candidate James Ingle offered a different take.“I have to agree with Mr. Krames that our bus system is 
much larger than it was in 1776,” Ingle said.City Commission hopefuls talk to local tea partiers

Comic book villains 
aren’t the only ones 
who can be two-
faced. Actually, politicians could teach them a thing or 
two. 
Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton delivered a speech about Internet freedom on 
Tuesday. After Egypt’s revo-
lution, it seemed especially 
pertinent for her to chide 
foreign governments about 
limiting online communica-
tion at the risk of debilitat-ing their nations.
Although she had the 
speech planned for weeks, the ample preparation time 
didn’t stop her from glossing 
over her own Internet policy debacle — namely the ac-
tions taken with WikiLeaks.
The original transcriber 
of the classified information 
committed a criminal act. 
That much we can agree with 
Clinton on. We start to see 
some hypocrisy because she targeted the distributors of 
said information. While the 
records were ill-gotten, jour -
nalists are legally allowed 
to publish anything they 
themselves did not commit 
a crime to retrieve. Once 
information is out, holding 
the messenger responsible is like closing the gate after the 
horse has bolted. 
Some may argue people 
involved with WikiLeaks 
are nothing akin to jour -
nalists, but it is the same mechanism Clinton says is the key to the future that is 
broadening that definition 
day by day. 
If the records were hand-
ed over to and published on-
line by a “traditional” media 
outlet — say, a large student 
newspaper — would Clin-
ton’s actions have seemed 
warranted? Before she cri-
tiqued another nation, she 
should give her own coun-
try’s policies a look.Walk of Blame
Amblers don’t mean 
you any harm
Apparently, people rage while they walk. And we 
don’t mean in a fun way.
According to the Wall Street Journal, several 
groups of researchers have been investigating how people react when confronted with slow-moving walkers ambling ahead of them. Considering the number of studies and the development of a Pedestrian Aggressiveness Syndrome Scale to chart how angered walkers vent, we’re guessing we don’t take it too well.
If you’re finding yourself muttering under your breath, 
feeling the need to explain to people how to walk or wanting to punch the person in front of you, you may need to take a breather. If you’re scratching your head right now, you’re probably living in peace with your sidewalk neighbors — 
unless you’re walking too slow for the person behind you.
We understand being in a hurry and wanting people to 
walk efficiently — handling school, internships and nightly 
obligations to a newspaper will do that to you —  but to wish someone else ill because they’re not staying to the right as they stroll along is a bit too much. (Please note, however, that we don’t excuse clumps of people from running others off the sidewalk because they refuse to allow them a little edge of the pavement. That’s rude.) 
We hope we’re doing a service to the community by ask-
ing everyone who silently — or not so silently — fumes to take a walk in the other people’s shoes. Most aren’t trying to annoy you. Some people are just slower. Some have time to kill. Some are trying to smell the roses. And maybe you should too.
Why does nobody like the word “like”?
There is a word that gets hated on a lot. It’s like, 
hearing it gets some people upset. They don’t like it, and they don’t like its use. 
Someone could say something like, “Be that as it may, 
when he uses it, he sounds like a child.”
The word I’m talking about is “like.” It has three main uses, and people generally don’t 
have a problem with one of them — its propositional use as in this sentence: “This movie is just like any other ro-mantic comedy — lame.” 
They do, however, take issue with the other two uses 
of the word. 
The quotative version used to indicate dialogue, as in 
“He told us, like, ‘Quit pruning my shrubs,’ and we were all, like, ‘Take more pride in your shrubbery.’” 
The final use seems to be the most blood-boiling. 
It is the filler used as a discourse marker. It’s used 
in sentences such as, “If the airport lost my dog, I 
would just, like, die,” or “Just because you dreamed he can, doesn’t mean, like, Bigfoot grants wishes.”  
But “like” is a juggernaut. It is ubiquitous in our genera-tion’s language. It sounds low and immature, and that is reason enough for some people to deny its use. 
But if you look long enough, you will begin to real-
ize why “like” has sprung up everywhere. It is extremely useful. As a college student, I come from a generation of observers. Everyone is constantly updating everyone else about their stories, their interests and their lives so much that we have websites and social networks dedicated to this end. And we can’t get enough. 
Often times, we relay something we saw, heard or 
read. More than any other past generation, we witness many stories, and that’s a lot to remember if you want to retell them later. You might not be entirely 
sure what someone said or how exactly an event occurred, but it is easy enough to get around 
directly quoting or literally describing a situation by throwing the word  “like” in there. 
“I heard that house show was, like, crazy.” We can 
be mostly sure that the house wasn’t a den of clini-cal insanity, but just in case someone takes us literally, we throw a “like” in there, so we’re good. It softens the blow and keeps us from committing to a statement. It’s a 
verbal disclaimer: “Please don’t, like, drink the bleach.”  
People have a generalized view that “like” is used by 
young women who are intellectually slow. The stereo-type was initially recognized in the 1982 song “Valley Girl” by Moon Unit Zappa and Frank Zappa.
Rest assured, men use it just as often as women 
do, yet somehow, they fly a little lower on the ra-dar and seem to get away with using the word, com-ing out far less scathed than their female counterparts.  
In the end, it is the use of  “like” in place of  
“uh” and “um” that paints the word, to some, as a ner -
vous tic which should be trimmed out of all sentences. 
So while I, like, know why you, like, don’t want 
the word to be spattered all, like, around someone’s spoken sentences, most people would, like, agree if you had “ums” and “uhs” in their place, there’s no, uh, way it wouldn’t, um, be just as, uh, obnoxious.  
Most of us aren’t practiced orators, and it is hard to spout continuous, uninterrupted brilliance to pontificate using zero fillers and wield flawless grammar. 
So, could you maybe, like, lighten up a little? Wesley Campbell is a fifth-year English major. His column

Senate Bill 234 was filed in December and is unrelated to 
the Arizona tragedy, despite recent media articles mak-ing it sound like a response. This bill would remove the 
restriction on individuals currently holding a valid Concealed Weapon or Firearm License (CWFL) from carrying on college 
campuses. It would also introduce open carry to Florida.
Your initial response may be that open carry is bad, but that 
response is based on emotion and not facts. In reality, it is less 
dramatic of an issue than you are inclined to think. As recent newspaper articles pointed out, 43 other states already have open carry , and they are not experiencing problems with it. 
Most people with the choice of carrying openly or concealed 
choose to carry concealed, whether for privacy , the benefit of surprise in the case of an attempted crime or just to avoid the 
heckling of citizens who choose not to carry and who have a lot 
of animosity toward CWFL holders. So, open carry is not going to drastically change our state. It would provide those carrying the benefit of not causing a legal headache if their concealed weapon were to be briefly exposed, as by a shirt blowing up in the wind, and the firearm being  seen in public. So let’s set aside that issue and get to the idea of carrying on campus.
The first thing you have to consider is that carrying on cam-
pus will not involve any new people carrying firearms. We are 
talking about the same CWFL holders who carry everywhere 
else in Alachua County and Florida: They are 21 and older, have voluntarily undergone a government background check, put their fingerprints on file with the state and have been trained on the legalities of the Florida statutes and safe firearm handling. This will obviously be only a small subset of the UF population, so any ideas of masses of students carrying fire-arms are false.
Carrying a firearm is a great personal 
responsibility that CWFL holders take seriously , shown here in Florida by only 
.02 percent of licenses being revoked for any reason since 1988, 
when carry was legalized. That means that 99.98 percent of 
CWFL holders have proven themselves to be upstanding citi-zens who do not participate in the crazy scenarios that anti-gun people dream up, such as shooting with road rage, in disputes as minor as over a parking space, or in our case during a dis-cussion of some topic in a college-type setting. CWFL holders as compared to the general population are actually 5.7 times less likely to be arrested for violent offenses and 13.5 times less likely to be arrested for nonviolent offenses. There is a huge 
distinction between CWFL holders who carry firearms legally 
and who are among the safest and most responsible citizens you’ll ever meet and criminals who don’t care about where car -
rying is banned in the first place.
In regard to campus carry, Colorado State University has 
been allowing concealed carry on its campus since 2003. Guess what: They have had zero problems to this day . Also, over the last four years, CSU’s crime has dropped by 60 percent. The University of Colorado’s crime rate, by comparison, has risen 
by 35 percent over the same time period, and they prohibit car -
ry . It is ludicrous to me that some people believe that someone 
crossing over the boundary onto a college campus will sud-denly become mentally unstable and lose all concept of per -
sonal responsibility. CSU’s case will hopefully give  everyone something to think about, because it provides an example of successful legal carry on a college campus.Situations where criminalized carry fails our society happen 
all the time, as seen in the Virginia Tech tragedy. Of the 32 vic-tims, 30 were killed after police responded, and any possibility of a licensed individual having any chance of defending him- or herself or classmates had been taken away by politicians who 
think that guns are bad. Notice how the gunmen behind these 
tragedies never care about following the law; gun-free zones should instead be called defense-free or easy-victim zones.  
I understand that many doubts about carry on campus are based on the concept that some of you believe that guns are scary . In reality, they are just tools and very safe ones. Also, they’re posi-tive for society: The FBI tells us that every year, people in the U.S. use firearms to defend themselves against criminals an es-timated 2.5 million times — that’s more than 6,500 times a day , 
or once every 13 seconds. According that data, firearms are 
used 65 times more often to prevent a crime than to commit one.  
Finally, please consider that UF is currently a defense-free “bubble” — it is legal for CWFL holders, of which there were about 754,000 in the state of Florida as of August 2010, to carry around much of Gainesville and Alachua County . 
SB 234 would recognize that licensed individuals who are 
already carrying are not engaging in inappropriate behavior everywhere around campus while carrying. There is no rational 
basis to the fear that they will suddenly become irresponsible 
solely depending on happening to be on campus. The “culture of fear” argument holds similarly little water: With a majority of CWFL holders continuing to choose to carry in a concealed manner, campus will be no more a fearful place to be than any off-campus Walmart, grocery store or movie theater is.

Fears about open carry, firearms on campuses unfoundedGuest column

Speaking OutTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
RENO, Nev. — Neighbors of a toxic mine in northern Ne-
vada have filed a class-action lawsuit against BP America and 
Atlantic Richfield Co. accusing them of intentionally and neg-ligently concealing the extent of the contamination leaking off the abandoned site for decades.
The suit filed in U.S. District Court in Reno on Monday 
seeks a minimum of $5 million on behalf of at least 100 resi-dents in the rural town of Yerington where the old Anaconda copper mine opened in 1941.
The plaintiffs say the wells they once used for drinking wa-
ter are polluted with uranium, arsenic and other metals in a plume of groundwater that slowly has migrated off of the site that covers 6 square miles — an area equal to the size of about 3,000 football fields — about 65 miles southeast of Reno.
The lawsuit says that even after whistleblowers started to 
publicize previously secret records documenting the dangers, the corporations refused to cooperate with state and federal regulators trying to clean up the radioactive and other hazard-ous waste the past 10 years.
“They destroyed the water supply to this community and 
now it’s time to clean it up. It’s time to get the contamination off these people’s land and out of their wells,” said Steven Ger -
man, one of the lawyers who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the 
residents.
The lawsuit said the companies knew or should have known 
that toxic and hazardous materials would pollute neighboring 
properties, air, water, groundwater and the surrounding en-vironment. It said they have ‘intentionally allowed toxic and hazardous substances to enter and remain on” the neighbors’ land.
“Despite their knowledge of the serious health and environ-
mental effects associated with exposure to toxic and hazard-
ous substances and despite orders and warnings from health 
and environmental regulators, (BP and ARCO) intentionally masked the true extent of the contamination, thereby enabling (them) to avoid taking all appropriate steps to properly reme-diate the toxic and hazardous substances or to mitigate the dangers created by their release, discharge, storage, handling, processing, disposal of and dumping of toxic and hazardous substances,” the suit said.
Tom Mueller, a spokesman for BP America, said Tuesday 
evening that company officials have not had a chance to review the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
Fueled by demand after World War II, Anaconda produced 
nearly 1.75 billion pounds of copper from 1952-78 at the mine that runs along U.S. Highway 95 in the Mason Valley, an ir -rigated agricultural oasis in the area’s otherwise largely barren high desert.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has determined 
over the years that uranium was produced as a byproduct of processing the copper and that the radioactive waste was ini-tially dumped into dirt-bottomed ponds that leaked into the groundwater.
Officials for BP and its subsidiary Atlantic Richfield, which 
bought Anaconda Copper Co. in 1978, have provided bottled 
water for free to any residents who want it over the past few 
years. But they have insisted that uranium naturally occurs in the region’s soil and, until recently , they argued there was no way to prove that a half-century of processing metals there was responsible for the contamination.
EPA testing first reported in November 2009 found that 79 
percent of the wells tested north of mine have dangerous levels of uranium or arsenic or both.
“You now have evidence of mine-impacted groundwater,” 
Steve Acree, a highly regarded hydrogeologist for the EPA in 
Oklahoma brought in to examine the test results, told AP at 
the time.
One monitoring well a half mile away had levels of urani-
um more than 10 times the legal drinking water standard. At the mine itself, wells tested as high as 100 times the standard in an area where ore was processed.8, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2011
The art gallery is operated by the guild members and artists
customers initially believe, so it is up to 
member artists to keep its doors open and its floors swept.  
Each member works a four-hour shift at 
the store once a month, Cohen-Crown said. If they don’t show up, the art doesn’t get sold, so there is a $50 no-show fee for mem-bers who miss their shifts. 
Artists are also on committees, such 
as publicity, that keep the co-op running smoothly.
Artists receive about 65 percent of the 
proceeds from the pieces sold in the gallery, 
while 35 percent of sales are used for guild expenses. 
A drawing in one corner of the gallery 
might cost $15, while a paint-
ing on the other end of the store costs $300. The price ranges can accommodate all 
shoppers, Cohen-Crown said. 
Whether a member earns all his or her in-come from art or does it only as a hobby, the 
guild provides a way for them to profit from 
their work. 
“It’s hard to do this out of the back of 
your car,” said Peter Senesac, who creates silver jewelry pieces and has been a member 
of the guild for more than 30 years. “We’re 
all partners.”GUILD , from page 1

A recent UF study revealed 
that exercise can help people with 
eating disorders or potentially prevent the disorders from devel-oping in the first place.
The study, published in the 
January issue of European Eating Disorders Review, revealed exer -
cise therapy proved to have posi-tive physical and psychological effects, according to a UF press release.
The team surveyed 539 stu-
dents at normal weight and as-sessed their drive to be thin, typical exercise schedule and like-lihood for exercise dependency. 
It hopes to launch another 
study to monitor at-risk patients 
and see if exercise curbs their ten-
dencies and symptoms.  
Dr. Dawn-Elise Snipes, owner 
and clinical director of Gainesville 
Counseling, said the study’s re-
sults are significant because the 
disorders are mainly psychologi-cal: Patients fixate on body image and attribute acceptance to their 
physical appearance. 
People with eating disorders 
equate being overweight with negative traits.  
“Food and weight have been 
conditioned in a dysfunctional 
setting,” Snipes said. 
The clinic addresses a patient’s 
social support, thinking patterns and emotions during recovery. Snipes said successful treatments of eating disorders are social, psychological and biological, and can include exercise if it’s not ap-proached as a substitute addic-tion.
“When it’s not being used to 
escape other things, exercise is not bad,” she said. “In addition to adequate coping, it can help them cope with life on life’s terms.” 
While exercise is a component 
to a healthy lifestyle, its benefits vary for those with eating dis-orders. It has been avoided in treatment because of the risk of compulsive exercising — another condition that is often indicative of other eating disorders. 
Roberta Seldman, a therapist 
at the UF Eating Disorders Pro-
gram, said everyone needs to get 
their bodies moving, but when it 
comes to eating disorders, exer -
cise has typically been viewed as unfavorable. 
Seldman estimated that about 
10 percent of UF students have a form of bulimia nervosa, 1 per -
cent have a diagnosed form of anorexia nervosa, and 60 percent 
have a disordered eating pattern 
or follow myths about food and 
exercise.
Study shows exercise could prevent eating disorders

Uranium was found in the drinking waterBy ALEX PECKHAM

The Florida women’s golf 
team’s frustrations persisted Tues-
day during the second round of the Northrup Grumman Regional Challenge. 
After intermittent rain showers 
and steady winds made play dif-ficult Monday, the Gators failed to take advantage of Tuesday’s calm-er weather and improved scoring conditions.
The problem for UF, however, 
is that the rest of the field did. 
The Gators’ 20-over-par team 
score, one stroke better than their first-round total, dropped them to eighth in the 13-team field.
Florida’s woes cannot be 
pinned on Mia Piccio, whose 1-over-par 72 moved her into a tie for seventh as an individual. 
Coach Jan Dowling praised the 
sophomore for her resilience after responding to a rough 3-over-par start on her first three holes. 
“The first four holes of this 
course are very difficult — every-body struggles on them — but Mia has been the best at responding af-ter tough starts,” Dowling said.
Another bright spot for the 
Gators was Andrea Watts, who rebounded from an 8-over-par opening round to shoot a 4-over 75 on Tuesday.
One of the more mystifying as-
pects of Florida’s struggles so far in the tournament has been the play of senior team captain Jessica Yadloczky. After an inconsistent 5-over-par 76 first-round result, Yadloczky shot a 9-over-par 80 in the second round to find herself tied for 43rd. 
Dowling remains confident in 
Yadloczky despite her early struggles. She said the root of the senior’s prob-lems has been re-lated to a lack of ac-
curacy off the tee, but she is closer to returning to her normal level of play than the scores reflect. 
Yadloczky was not the only 
Gator who had a difficult second round. Evan Jensen shot a 7-over-par 78, and Isabelle Lendl turned in an 8-over-par 79. 
Dowling remains happy with 
the mindset of her team, saying UF still has the confidence to mount a late climb up the leaderboard dur -
ing Wednesday’s final round. 
“If a few breaks go our way,” 
Dowling said, “things will be very different tomorrow.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 9

Going into Florida’s matchup  
against No. 3 North Carolina, coach 
Amanda O’Leary declared open season on each of the team’s 15 start-ing spots.
Every position was up for grabs, 
and no number of stats, starts or recruiting stars could save play-ers from dropping down the depth chart before the year began.
Sophomore goalkeeper Cara 
Canington started every game in 2010, helped lead UF to a winning record and had the third-best goal-
to-save average in the nation among 
freshman goalies. 
But as her form slipped in prac-
tices heading into the No. 17 Gators’ matchup against the Tar Heels on Saturday , fellow sophomore Mikey Meagher began to shine.
Last year’s second-string goalie 
fixed her form, which previously 
relegated her to the backup role, and 
started to compete harder in prac-tice. O’Leary took notice and award-ed Meagher her first start in goal.
“It’s what I was waiting for, for 
a long time,” Meagher said. “I defi-nitely had nerves, but I was also excited at the same time to compete against the best, and it really put me 
to the test to see what I could handle on this level.”
Canington had to watch the sea-
son opener from the sidelines for the first time as a Gator, as Meagher gave 
up 10 goals and made seven saves during Florida’s overtime loss.On a team with as much young 
talent as Florida, O’Leary explained that players are either the hunter or the hunted. Nowhere is this bet-ter seen than at the competition be-tween goalkeepers.
“It’s one of those positions where 
the hot stick is going to be rewarded,” 
Canington said. “If you’re seeing the 
ball better that day , you know, it’s whatever’s best for the team.”
Meagher played a little more 
than 83 minutes of lacrosse last sea-son compared to Canington’s 998 minutes. Even with the substantial gap in experience, it was Meagher who was tabbed in goal against the 
Tar Heels and on the road tonight at 
7:30 against Jacksonville (1-0).
“I felt like Mikey played a great 
game, and she did a really nice job, but again, they’re competing ev-ery single day in practice for who is going to start in the next game,” O’Leary said.
A trip to Jacksonville should 
do nothing but help Meagher’s ré-sumé in goal. The Gators (0-1) last played JU during an exhibition in Gainesville on Oct. 2, where the home team demolished the Dol-phins 23-5. 
Florida’s potent offense, led by 
sophomore Kitty Cullen, should also help Meagher by keeping possession 
out of JU’s grasp. Cullen, coming off 
a four-goal game against UNC, con-tributed four scores in the October matchup with the Dolphins.10, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 16, 2011

n THE SECOND BASEMAN BATTED .224 AS A 
JUNIOR LAST YEAR.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Staff Writer
jsimonton@alligator.org
 
For Josh Adams, effort was never the problem.
He didn’t hit .224 because he didn’t have the tal-
ent. He didn’t lead the team in double plays because 
he didn’t care.  He didn’t drop in the lineup because he 
wasn’t trying. 
Adams was thinking too hard. Before Florida’s 2010 campaign, Adams, tradition-
ally a second baseman, established himself as one of the premier players in the Southeastern Conference.
A slick-fielding infielder with some serious pop, 
Adams earned first-team All-SEC accolades in con-
secutive seasons, something no Gator had done since Brad Wilkerson accomplished it during the 1997 and 
1998 seasons.
But last year, something changed. Whether it was 
the newfound pressure because he was eligible for the draft, or the overbearing responsibility of being a stal-
wart veteran on a team infused with young talent, Ad-ams struggled. Miserably.
Adams, now a senior, said despite the team doing 
so well last season, he was constantly frustrated at the 
plate. Mentally, he said, he had no answers.
“You go from at-bat to at-bat and strike out one at-
bat and the next at-bat you’re like, ‘What am I going to 
do now?’” 
After his first two seasons hitting well over .300, 
Adams barely eclipsed the Mendoza line (.206) in SEC play last year. While he knocked a career-high nine 
home runs, he set career lows in RBIs and on-base and 
slugging percentage.  
“It’s pretty evident that he didn’t swing the bat as 
well as he wanted to,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.

Senior second baseman Josh Adams struggled throughout the 2010 season, posting a .224 batting average and falling down the lineup. He attributed his woes to mental mistakes — something he is seeking to correct this year. 
Adams looks to return to form in senior season
After all the dust has cleared 
from the countrywide holiday that is National Signing Day, 
one thing still confuses me.
Jacoby Brissett to the Gators? Re-
ally?
Brissett, the country’s third-best 
dual-threat quarterback prospect, was down to Miami, Wisconsin and Flori-da. Yet he chose to come to Gainesville and join Jeff Driskel, the top-rated pro-style quarterback in this year’s class.  
Not only is that unusual, but in an 
era of momma’s boys, Brissett chose UF against the wishes of his mother, who wanted him to become a Hurri-
cane.
Huh? But this isn’t 
new — at least 
not for Florida.
The last team 
to convince two 
of the top three 
quarterbacks in a recruiting class to com-mit to the same school was Florida in 2007, 
when Urban Meyer signed the No. 3 pro-style quarterback, John Brantley , and the No. 2 dual-threat quarterback, Cam Newton.Brissett’s commitment baffling

By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
A variety of explanations have been of-
fered to justify the Florida women’s basket-
ball team’s struggles this year.
First, it was six new players, then youth 
and inexperience. Then, the team wasn’t tough enough, and it turned the ball over 
too much. 
The newest? Chemistry.
Junior guard and co-captain Jordan Jones 
said the best teams have the best chemistry. While it may not be a necessity for success, 
she does have a point. 
Players on championship teams like each other, for the most part. They get along and hang out away from the structured routine 
athletics demand. More 
importantly, they know each other’s games and 
know what to expect.
Clearly, chemistry is 
beneficial rather than det-rimental. It can also be the difference in close games, 
and the Gators know a 
thing or two about those.
They have had 12 games decided by 
six points or fewer — eight of them losses. Gators point to chemistry as 
latest reason for down year

UF hoping team meeting solves latest issue
Florida lost to No. 10 DePaul and No. 19 Kentucky 
by one and dropped games against No. 15 Florida State and Ole Miss by  two-points.
No wonder Florida coach Amanda Butler criti-
cized the team’s unity and togetherness after an-
other debilitating defeat by a small margin against 
Alabama on Sunday.  
“It’s just about us staying together and always 
knowing where someone’s going to be — just taking that extra step to be a better team basically,” fresh-
man guard Brittany Shine said.
But that’s even tougher for Shine. After playing 
39 total minutes and scoring 31 points against Van-
derbilt and Ole Miss, Shine played just 22 combined 
minutes in Florida’s next two losses.
The Gators routinely rotate at least 10 of their 12 
players each game, and Shine’s minutes have occa-
sionally suffered, but she isn’t quick to complain.  Instead, she credits time spent during the sum-
mer, practice and film sessions as reasons why the team should mesh well together. 
Jones also said she doesn’t want to use that as ex-
cuse for the Gators’ decline, but admitted the team has had trouble with their chemistry in Southeast-ern Conference play. 
“At the beginning of the season, that was one of 
our strengths,” Jones said. “We were playing to-gether. We were doing the little things. We were young, but we were doing things that made up for that.
“It’s something that we’re going to get back to,” 
she continued, adding that chemistry off the court is just as important. 
Jones said Florida could improve its chemistry 
with more trips to the movies, or out to eat — as a team. 
She also said the team had a meeting about the 
topic, emphasizing maturity and avoiding the dra-ma that can unfold by going behind one another’s 
backs. 
The last time the Gators held a team meeting was 
on the heels of a similar four-game losing streak. 
They talked about being obsessed, another one of 
those explanations. 
They also won their next two games. 
“We’ve got to be like sisters,” Shine said. “That’s 
going to help us in the long run.”W-HOOPS , from page 17
Saj Guevara / Alligator 
Florida guard Jordan Jones said the Gators will look to improve their 
chemistry off the court and addressed the topic in a team meeting.
Since then, Brantley has disappointed and 
Newton  won a Heisman while leading Auburn 
to a national championship.
Meyer’s decision to trust Brantley over New-
ton as Tim Tebow’s successor completely shifted 
the college football world, as UF endured a five-
loss season in 2010 and the Tigers won the title.
But Meyer had a simpler task when he was 
posed with the dilemma because Tebow was still in the fold for two more seasons. Will Mus-champ doesn’t have that luxury.
The new coach will likely be faced with the 
same scenario, and his initial level of success will depend on his choice.
Brantley isn’t exactly Tebow, and one slip-
up will ignite the whole fan base to call for the freshmen.
This means Muschamp will likely make his 
initial decision between Driskel and Brissett sooner rather than later.
Driskel has the advantage right now since he 
decided to enroll early . But once Brissett arrives in the fall, all bets are off. 
Don’t get me wrong: It’s a good problem to 
have for Florida. But it’s only good if Muschamp makes the right choice. If not, the scenario can only lead to regrets.
This whole thing feels like one of those game 
shows where a bunch of women describe them-selves to a potential suitor over a microphone while lined up behind a curtain, and the man is posed with the challenge of avoiding the unat-
tractive ones.
The man in UF’s situation is clearly Mus-
champ. But the beautiful girl is still unknown.
Only one will stay at Florida, and the odd one 
out will likely transfer, much like Newton did.
However, this time it is on Muschamp to 
make sure the quarterback who wins a Heisman 
and a national championship is doing it for the Gators.ANTHONY , from page 17Adams ready for fresh start 
after inconsistent season
“But like most sports, you’re going 
to go through some rough patches, 
and you just don’t know when it’s 
going to happen. It unfortunately hit 
him last year.”
Despite comparisons made be-
tween the junior year struggles of Adams and former Gator Matt den 
Dekker, the center fielder’s difficul-ties were largely overblown.
While den Dekker’s junior sea-
son was his worst,  he  was still well above Adams’ numbers from a year ago. In 2009, den Dekker nearly hit 
.300, and his on-base percentage was 
above .400. Yet, for Adams, his num-bers were down across the board. 
After two seasons of being one of 
the most consistent Gators to get on base, he had the second worst per -
centage of any regular last season, only in front of a freshman catcher. 
But Adams said his issues were 
not mechanical, merely cerebral.  
“Everybody has the tools to play 
the game,” he said. “It’s just whether mentally you can handle it.”
The senior admitted the difficulty 
in working on the mental part of the game, but said, “It’s 
something you have 
to just try and move 
forward.”
“It’s a new year. 
New things can happen,” he said. “I had a bad junior year, but I can’t 
dwell on it. Now, I’ve got to move forward. It’s always nice to have a 
fresh start.”BASEBALL , from page 17

Florida senior second baseman Aja Paculba has helped freshmen Kasey Fagan and Cheyenne Coyle 
deal with the nerves that come as a result of the transition from high school to college. 
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
 
As someone who has started 
more than 200 games at Florida, 
Aja Paculba knows playing for a big-time program can be nerve-
wracking for a freshman.
Paculba, the team’s most ex-
perienced player, has opened the 
season on a tear with a .500 batting 
average and two home runs. The 
senior second baseman has also 
been a steady presence for a start-ing infield that features two fresh-
men in Kasey Fagan and Chey-
enne Coyle. 
“I’m seeing the ball really well,” 
Paculba said. “The biggest thing is that I’m staying calm in the box 
and staying positive. And not let-
ting negative things affect me is 
really helping.” 
While Paculba and the Gators 
are looking forward to continuing their undefeated start with their 
first home series of the season this 
weekend, they will first have to 
hit the road Wednesday to take on 
Jacksonville at 6 p.m.
Paculba’s ability to contribute 
in different ways on and off the 
field has paid dividends early. The 
senior has taken Coyle under her 
wing and said she is already one 
of her closest friends on the team. 
Paculba said developing a close 
relationship with the freshmen, and letting them know it’s OK to 
make mistakes or be nervous, is 
important to overcoming their 
nerves.
That advice has been particu-
larly helpful for Fagan. 
The 2010 National Gatorade 
Player of the Year has stepped in as the starter at third base, and al-
though she admits she didn’t have 
the best performance last week-end, the atmosphere around the 
team is very positive. 
“We’ve been rolling through 
pretty much everyone our first 
five games,” Fagan said. “A lot of that 
has to do with how good we all work to-
gether. We love be-
ing with each other 
on the field and off the field, and that has a big impact on how we 
play.”
Adjusting to the college game 
has been easier than expected for Fagan. 
While she knew it would be 
much different than travel ball, the tough opposition has present-
ed Fagan more of a challenge than 
getting used to her new team. 
“The higher level of competi-
tion is pretty intense,” Fagan said. 
“But you can feel at ease if you 
don’t do your best because the rest of the team is way better and they 
can pick me up.”Paculba serving as mentor to freshmen Fagan, Coyle

ida coach Gregg Troy said. “We’ve 
got a real good situation and we’re 
pretty comfortable with what we 
have to do.”
Freshman Elizabeth Beisel 
will look to build on her excellent 
freshman season, and junior Shara 
Stafford, who has been out since the meet against Georgia Tech on Jan. 7, will be returning to the women’s team.
Troy said he knows what he has 
to do with the men, too: catch up. They go into the swimming com -
petition at a distant third behind No. 8 Tennessee and No. 3 Auburn with 49 points.
Troy said the Gators will prob-
ably have to take risks with top swimmers like Conor Dwyer and Sebastien Rousseau to narrow the gap.“We have some points to make 
up,” Troy said. “The guys who’ve 
already qualified for the NCAA 
meet, we may not swim them in the best spot for them individu-ally. They may have to do some things for the team they wouldn’t normally do.”
There will also be some shuf-
fling on the women’s side due to the suspensions handed out to juniors Lily Ramirez and Daniela Victoria as a result of their Feb. 5 arrests in Orlando for shoplifting.Troy said the meet, which be-
gins today at 10 a.m., will feature 
four top-10 teams for the men and 
women.
“On paper, it looks like Au-
burn’s favored a little on the men’s side and Georgia on the women’s, 
but that’s why we have the compe-
tition,” he said.
The competition begins with 
the 200-yard medley relay and 800 
freestyle relay preliminary com -
petitions and continues with the 
finals at 6 p.m. 
The meet will be held in the 
O’Connell Center from today until 
Saturday, and tickets are sold out 
for all four days.
The early start for the relays 
may be a tough draw for Florida, 
as  Troy said relays are an area 
of needed improvement for the Gators.
“We have to find a way to swim 
better relays and make sure our depth pays off in the meet,” he said.
In addition to vying for confer -
ence championships, Troy said he 
hopes to qualify more swimmers 
for the NCAA Swimming and Div-ing Championships.
“We haven’t qualified everyone 
we would like to,” he said. “It is 
a real big one being at home, and 
then you put on top of it, it is our qualifier to the NCAA meet. 
“So, we like to say it is like any 
other swim meet, but it is a little more than any other swim meet.”Gators women look to hold ground in SEC meet

Junior swimmer Teresa Crippen and the Florida women’s swimming team will enter the swimming por -
tion of the 2011 SEC Swimming and Diving Championships in second place behind No. 3 Auburn.  
“There’s a big plus to being 
at home, and it will be a 
loud crowd.”
