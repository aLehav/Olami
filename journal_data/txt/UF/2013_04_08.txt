When UF alumna Stephanie Seguin was 
a student, she had to resort to the “crossing-your-fingers-and-hope-you’re-not-pregnant 
method” of contraception when the pharmacy was closed.
After a decade of ﬁ  ghting for women and 
girls’ rights to control their bodies, Seguin and the National Women’s Liberation have found success as the federal court Friday ordered the Federal Drug Administration to make the morning-after pill an over-the-counter drug with no restrictions within the next month.
Before the court’s ruling, the morning-after 
pill, also known as Plan B, was kept behind a counter and only available without a prescrip-tion for women ages 17 and older after show-ing government-issued identiﬁ  cation. The lawsuit, Tummino v. Hamburg, was ﬁ  led in 2005 against the FDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to reverse these 
restrictions, arguing the emergency contracep-
tion is scientiﬁ  cally proven to be a safe and ef- Morning-after pill available over the counter

In celebration of the 90th annual Gator 
Growl and Homecoming, the theme for 
2013 has been announced as Footprints of the Swamp.
Growl Executive Producer Megan Har-
mon wrote in an email that the theme was chosen last week and has been in the brain-storming process since December.
“Because this is the 90th year of Gator 
Growl and Homecoming, we really wanted to make the theme not only about the pres-ent Gator Nation but also incorporating the past and future,” the 22-year-old industrial and systems engineering senior wrote in an email.
Harmon said there would be a couple 
of changes for the upcoming Growl and Homecoming, including different venues for events.
“I’m hoping to have a little something in 
the show for every generation that has come through this university,” she wrote.
Evan Galin, director of public relations 
for UF Homecoming, said she was happy with the theme choice.
“Nothing is going to be a huge change,” 
the 21-year-old public relations junior said, “but we’re really going to hone in on The Gator Nation in general and how cool it is be a part of this long standing tradition.”
Beginning Veterans Day weekend, the 
Footprints of the Swamp Growl will be on Nov. 8, and the Homecoming football game against Vanderbilt will be on Nov. 9.

hip-hop and more. For more 
information, visit www.danc-museum employee came forward 
and told the truth: Cashew was 
never stolen.
“The action taken by the em-
ployee Thursday afternoon was wrong and is not reflective of the 
integrity of the staff who dedicate 
themselves to the highest of Mu-seum & Aquarium standards,” Enzler said in a statement Friday.
Enzler said the employee, 
whose name and position has not been released, will be reprimand-ed. He said it was a personal issue and did not provide any addition-
al information.
Cashew is one of six large tor-
toises on display in the enclosure. 
A 4-foot glass wall separates visi-
tors from the creatures.
Enzler said the notion of a sto-
len tortoise grabbed national at-
tention.
“The idea that someone may 
steal a tortoise was so disturbing, and I think people responded to that,” he said.
He’s just glad the tortoise is in 
good health, and he said staff is reviewing the enclosures.
“It has good karma to know 
Cashew wasn’t stolen and some-one didn’t violate the museum 
and its exhibit,” he said. “I think 
it restores our faith in humanity to know someone didn’t take the animal.”
The 9-year-old tortoise will be 
back on display Saturday.
Southern Calif. man stages April 
Fool’s plane joke 
YUCAIPA, Calif. — It’s the 
plane crash that wasn’t in South-ern California.
The Riverside Press-Enterprise 
reports a Yucaipa businessman staged an elaborate April Fool’s joke on Monday.
Billy Cheesman Jr. used a fork-
lift to arrange a small aircraft on the fence that runs in front of his equipment rental business, as if it had nosedived there.
He also strung yellow caution 
tape around to make it resemble a crash scene.
Cheesman said someone gave 
him the two-seat experimental plane, and he’s been trying to fig-ure out what to do with it.
He notified the San Bernardino 
County Sheriff’s Department be-fore he set up the prank at Red-lands Yucaipa Rentals.

Iowa museum says tortoise was 
never stolen
DUBUQUE, Iowa — An Af-
rican leopard tortoise thought 
to be stolen from an Iowa mu-
seum was actually trapped be-
hind paneling in her enclosure, and a misguided employee who found her lied to keep up the 
story about her theft, the mu-
seum announced Friday.
In a bizarre move, the em-
ployee who found the 18-pound reptile named Cashew put her 
into a building elevator in an 
attempt to prevent the mu-seum further embarrassment, 
said Jerry Enzler, president and 
CEO of the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium in Dubuque.
The tortoise was found alone 
in a museum elevator on Thurs-day, two days after the museum had discovered she was missing and announced she had been 
stolen. Museum officials told 
media outlets Thursday they believed a regretful thief had smuggled her back inside.

$50,000 TO BRING LEADERS.
JACLYN ROSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Not everyone relives all the things 
from childhood, but UF students are 
determined to bring RECESS to cam-pus next fall.
RECESS is a touring music festival featuring an entrepreneur speaker session and startup company career fair. The event is like South by South-
west for college students, Jack Shan-
non, the company’s co-founder said.
UF is currently in second place in 
RECESS’ competition to bring the fes-tival to universities nationwide.
Scott Lombardo, a 23-year-old law 
and business administration graduate student, is working with his fraterni-ty, Pi Kappa Alpha, and UF Innova-tors to raise the funds for the event, which would be in September.
He said UF must raise about 
$50,000 to bring some of the nation’s top business leaders to speak to stu-dents in the entrepreneurial speaker session.
“We’re working with local 
Gainesville startups to do that and start a crowd funding campaign to reach out to interested parties,” Lom-bardo said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2013

tabby cat, during Spring Fling, a two-day adoption event at Alachua County Animal Services. 
SARAH KINONEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Sawyer peered through the 
holes of his kennel Saturday at his 
new family with what looked like a smile.
In just a few days, the 9-month-
old domestic short-haired tabby cat would be home with his newly adopted parents, April and A.J. Son-tag, of Bradford County.
Like Sawyer, 11 other cats and 
dogs found homes during the Ala-chua County Animal Services Spring Fling, a two-day pet adoption event 
held Friday and Saturday.
Although the Sontags weren’t ex-
pecting to find a cuddly companion 
as soon as they arrived, once they met Sawyer, they adopted him in a matter of minutes.
“We kept asking ourselves, ‘Are 
we sure we want to do this?’” A.J. Sontag, 70, said. “Then we realized we might be being a little selfish — Train, our other cat, needs a com-panion.”
The goal of the two-day event 
was to get as many animals into new homes as possible, said Hilary 
Hynes, Alachua County Animal 
Services public education program coordinator.
“We wanted to improve the 
stray cat adoption,” she said, “and of course, we never have an event without the option of adopting the dogs.”
Prices for adopting both cats and 
dogs varied. While some cats and dogs were adopted free of charge, the event adoption prices were $33 for cats and $45 for dogs. Since April 2, a total of 34 animals have been ad-opted from the shelter.
Hynes said because the shelter 
would like to see animals adopted daily, the event adoption prices will 
apply until April 10.
“We don’t want people to wait 
until an event,” she said. “We want 
people to check out the animals ev-ery day.”

UF alumna pushed for it
fective form of birth control.
Gainesville women have been at 
the forefront of the campaign, with the Gainesville chapter of the Wom-en’s Liberation sending members to 
testify in front of the FDA.
National Women’s Liberation 
founder Candi Churchill said she, 
Seguin and other plaintiffs pointed out the morning-after pill is available over the counter in 63 other countries and shared their experiences with it.
“I really resent having spent 10 
years of my life organizing to get my government to make something acces-sible that is perfectly safe,” Churchill said.
The 1998 UF alumna has been pro-
testing for the accessibility of the pill since she was a student, finding it in-sulting that she was patronized at the infirmary when she went to ask for it.After finding the pill to be a safe re-
lief, Churchill and other members of the Gainesville chapter took action. In addition to filing a lawsuit and testi-fying, past efforts have included Give 
Your Friends the Morning After Pill, 
in which they illegally gave the pill to women in need when it was prescrip-tion-only.
“I think we made a big impact,” 
Churchill said. “We’re a small town, and we’re ordinary women, but we’ve studied the issue and looked at our own experiences.”
Andrea Costello, the attorney rep-
resenting the National Women’s Lib-eration, said it’s a landmark victory for females in the United States.
“This case really shows that when 
you combine really powerful grass-roots organizing and women de-manding our rights with really good legal arguments, you get a recipe for 
justice,” she said.plAn b , from page 1

Biting into a science experiment may not 
sound all that appetizing, but Hannah Gavin said 
she wouldn’t mind giving it a taste test.
Synthetic meat, also known as vitro meat or 
cultured meat, is a genetically engineered animal flesh product and is currently hot topic in the sci-ence world.
The twist: The meat has never been part of a 
living animal.
Although it isn’t currently in production, ex-
perts like Gabor Forgacs, a biological physicist and a professor at the University of Missouri, 
have successfully created synthetic meat.
During a 2011 TEDMED event, Forgacs dis-
cussed the benefits of synthetic meat and said it 
could help reduce food shortages and cut down on resources used to raise animals for meat. He also cooked and ate his own synthetic meat on stage.
Although food experts recognize the benefits 
of synthetic meat, they say the resources needed to commercially produce it are far from available.   
Keith Schneider, a UF food science and human 
nutrition associate professor, said synthetic meat 
is more of a science experiment than a current production prod-uct.
“It’s more of a pie-in-the-
sky type of thing, where just because they can do something doesn’t mean it will ever be done commercially,” he said. “It looks interesting, but it’s one 
of those things that doesn’t re-
ally mean it’s going to happen.”
While Gavin, a 21-year-old UF aerospace en-
gineering junior, said synthetic meat sounds like 
something out of a science-fiction movie, she’d be up for trying it.Fake meat — not just for veganslocAl

Every year, Norma Nickerson attends the

interest in how the artists create their mas-terpieces.
Nickerson was one of about 110,000 peo-
ple who attended the 44th annual festival, which featured pieces by artists from Florida and around the world as well as food and live music.
Kathryn Lehman, coordinator of cultural 
programs at SFC, said this year’s festival was dedicated to Lennie Kesl, a former fac-ulty member at SFC and a member of the 
Gainesville art community, who died in No-
vember. The festival held a jazz concert in his honor and reprinted Kesl’s previous Spring 
Arts posters.
“The most important thing is the weather 
and the artists, and they’re both beautiful,” 
Lehman said.
Ummarid Eitharong, a 60-year-old profes-
sional artist from Orlando, said his art has been featured in the festival for more than 10 
years. Saturday, Eitharong received an award 
of excellence for his mixed-media paintings. Eitharong said he enjoys showcasing his 
work at the festival because he’s proud to be 
part of Gainesville’s art community.

Construction begins today on a new 
learning center in the Austin Cary Me-
morial Forest.
UF’s School of Forest Resources and 
Conservation honored students, alumni 
and donors at a groundbreaking cere-
mony at the forest about six miles north-east of Gainesville. About 400 people at-tended the ceremony Saturday.
“It was a good opportunity to show 
off what the new building is gonna be like and the opportunities,” said Scott Sager, education coordinator in the School of Forest Resources and Conservation.
A fire destroyed the original building 
in July 2011. The community immediate-ly supported rebuilding it, he said.
Sager said the building was designed 
to be about 50 percent larger than the original to accommodate the growth of the school and the need for educational resources. The building will have a 200-person capacity conference room, Inter-net access and a 30-person classroom. 
Sarah Graves, a 26-year-old first-year 
graduate student in forest resources and conservation, said after the old building 
burned down, she would instruct stu-
dents on the side of the road.
Sager said he looked forward to gen-
erating memories in the building.New center promises growth

Hammaad Saber relived his elementary 
school glory days Sunday afternoon.
“I felt like a 5-year-old in a 19-year-old 
body,” said the UF industrial and systems 
engineering freshman. He was named hop-
scotch champion at the Hopping 4 A Cure 
tournament.
About 100 students attended the event, 
hosted by Freshman Leadership Outreach at the Broward Outdoor Recreation Complex.
Hopping 4 A Cure’s co-founder David 
Nassau said the event raised about $1,000 to fund multiple sclerosis research and scholar-ships for students who have been either di-rectly or indirectly affected by the condition.
Nassau, an 18-year-old UF marketing 
freshman, said this event was inspired by a high school joke, when he and a friend said they were the first official members of the varsity hopscotch team.
“Our peers became really excited about 
it, so we decided to make an event out of 
this and raise the money for charity,” Nas-
sau said.
He chose the National Multiple Sclerosis Society because his father has the condition.
Michael Nassau, David’s 24-year-old 
brother who works in the film industry, drove from South Florida to show his sup-port and film footage for the documentary he is making about their father.
“I respect my brother tremendously,” 
Michael Nassau said. “Even though he is younger than me, I have always looked up to him.”MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

UF adjunct professor and photogra-
pher Jeremiah Stanley and his wife, Mere-
dith, are preparing to go to Greece to cap-ture the stories of sex trafficking victims.
“The more we researched and learned, 
the more it started to change us as peo-ple,” he said. “We felt like we had to do something.”
After brainstorming ideas, the two de-
cided a portrait project would be a good way to document the slavery and help spread the message. They set up a page on www.USAprojects.org with a goal of $15,000. The money will help pay for trav-
el expenses, food and equipment. As of 
press time, about $5,000 had been raised.
Jeremiah Stanley said they picked 
Greece because it’s known as the gateway into Europe for slavery traffickers. The team, which also includes their assistant, Sierra Clemons, plans to be gone for about a month.
“It’s really hard for them to talk about 
their experiences,” he said. “For the first week, we may not even take a picture because we don’t want to make victims feel any more exploited than they already are.”
Meredith Stanley said she hopes the  
victims will realize that by standing up and showing their faces, they’ll be able to make a difference in educating people.
Upon the completion of the trip to 
Greece, the photographs will be on dis-play at Anthem Church in Gainesville.UF teacher

at a ceremony held at the presi-

She said she didn’t expect to 
win because of the heavy com-petition.
“There’s so many people, so many faculty, so many great teachers on campus that it was quite a surprise,” she said.
Oli began teaching at UF in 
Spring 2011. She is credited with revamping the microbiology curriculum.
Microbiology and cell sci-
ence chairman Eric Triplett said he counted on Oli to modernize and organize the department’s lab system.
“It’s a big job,” he said. “She 
works countless hours and puts a lot of 
thought and creativity.”
Yor-
danis Diez, a 23-year-old UF micro-
biology and 
cell science 
senior, has been Oli’s teaching assistant for four semesters. He wrote a recommendation letter for her application.
“She loves what she does,” he said. “It could not have hap-pened to a better professor.”
Oli said her education from 
Germany, Scotland and the U.S., and her outside work experience set her apart from the competi-tion. She is thankful for the teach-
ers who helped her succeed.
“Once you feel how it feels 
to be inspired by somebody, I 
think, only then, you can give it back,” she said.

propriate” email from Gainesville2Go?Today’s question: Have you ever taken Plan B? 
People, please stop stealing free stuff
Wednesday night, a speaker came to the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts and delivered what was an enthralling, interesting and appro-
priately comedic speech I will likely not forget.  
For those of you who don’t know or who are possi-
bly just extremely good at avoiding the 200,000 bulletins around campus that screamed for attention worse than your old high school friend who used to tell you all about his made-up recording contract and girlfriend from Cali, Neil deGrasse Tyson is indeed the person to whom I am referring.
This event, put on by the wonderful (or at least now I 
consider them so because they brought Tyson to UF) Accent Speaker’s Bureau, was something I thoroughly enjoyed, and I am quite positive every other individual there did as well.  From asteroids to laxatives, it seems Tyson said all that ever needed to be said in a single talk.  
The talk was very important to me, but that’s not what 
I want to highlight. I want to highlight an incredible inde-cency that stood out even among the great beauty of that night.
I understand there are plenty of students who don’t 
give one piss about this man or what he had to say, but the amount of students who waited in line to get two tickets just to turn them around and try to scalp them is beyond belief.  
You people were scalping free tickets, and most of you 
were asking $100 — for free tickets!
Whether it’s been said to you or not, I hope you realize 
that if you tried to scalp free tickets, then you are quite pos-sibly one of the most repulsive and just incredibly aggra-vating individuals alive. Not to mention your desired proﬁ  t was actually inﬁ  nite, which is just ludicrous (even burglars have to put in a little bit of effort to make their money).
These tickets sold out in about 30 minutes. Poof, and 
they were gone. Some people wanted to blame Accent for booking the Phillips Center or how they let people get two tickets. But let’s understand here, people: Accent is not the one at fault.
The problem here is the 
abundance of sad students whose integrity is literally worth about $100.  
Accent, by the way, did a 
stand-up job of getting word out about the show, which included creating an event on 
Facebook (because it’s not ofﬁ  cial until it’s Facebook-ofﬁ  -cial, amirite).
Can you guess what the Internet decided was the most 
logical use for that page after the tickets were handed out? “What is scalping, Alex?” is the only acceptable answer.
I guess I’d also technically have to accept, “What are a--
holes being a--holes?”
What I ﬁ  nd most interesting are the people who picked 
up tickets and then three hours later posted saying, “Ugh, it turns out I can’t go to the show anymore, so if you want to buy my tickets, message me.”
Is that so? You were certain you could attend a show the 
very next night until three hours after you got your free tick-ets?  I’m not sure who’s worse though, these people or just the blunt, “Two tickets $100 each. Who wants them?”
Luckily I had a ticket and didn’t want Lt. Cool Guy’s 
ticket. Although I was kind of curious as to where he got his tight, Greek-letter adorned tank top because I would have traded him my ticket for one of those for sure.
I could go on and on about how ridiculous the whole 
situation was, but the saddest thing about it was it did not surprise me. Not even a little.
Man’s indecency to man struck once again. To badly 
paraphrase Tyson (and I apologize in advance, Neil, if this gets you a bad rap), “Just be a decent human being, you jacka--, and live life to the fullest.”

Maduro threatens 
voters with curse 
Hey, are curses real? Just checking for the people of Ven-
ezuela.
Nicolas Maduro, the acting president of Venezuela 
since Hugo Chavez died last month, has been invoking a centu-ries-old curse upon those who don’t vote for him in next week’s 
elections.
“If anyone among the people votes against Nicolas Maduro, 
he is voting against himself, and the curse of Maracapana is fall-
ing on him,” Maduro said recently at a political rally, according to an article by BBC News.
“If the bourgeoisie win, they are going to privatise health 
and education, they are going to take land from the Indians, the curse of Maracapana would come on you,” he continued.
What Maduro was referring to was a 16th century battle — a 
massacre, actually — fought between the Spanish and the indig-enous people of Venezuela. However, there isn’t a clear story about a curse involved in the incident. It was a massacre, and that’s about all we know about it. One of the only references to the “curse” is on a website called Fausta’s Blog, so we’re just as skeptical as you about the validity of the information. Seeing as there are so few details out there about this event, we’re trusting Fausta.
“[B]ack to the curse, I’m not sure what the hey he’s talking 
about, either,” Fausta wrote. “The battle of Maracapana took place in 1567, when the Spanish army massacred thousands of indians. Unlike the legends around King Tut, there have been (as far as I could ﬁ  nd as of the writing of this post), no legends associated with that speciﬁ  c massacre. This website says ‘the bourgeoisie is the curse.’ Which makes sense if you’re a Com-munist. Whatever.”
The website she refers to is a Spanish news site that also cov-
ered Maduro’s speech at the rally. Either way, we suppose the 
curse would be a lot more terrifying if we could ﬁ  nd any actual 
history about the curse. It’s bizarre.
“The race took a somewhat surreal turn on Saturday when 
Maduro said a centuries-old curse would fall on the heads of those who do not vote for him,” said a report from Reuters. Yeah. Could you imagine a U.S. presidential candidate cursing the supporters of their opponent with a centuries-old indig-enous curse?
“[Henrique] Capriles, who is predicting a late pro-opposition 
surge as sympathy wears off after Chavez’s death, is vowing to install a Brazilian-style administration of free-market economics with strong social welfare policies,” continued the report.
“‘Anyone who threatens the people, who tells the people a 
curse can fall on them, has no right to govern this country,’ he said at a rally in the western state of Tachira,” reported the BBC News article. “‘I tell you here, all Venezuelans, the real curse is that little group that we are going to get rid of on April 14.’”
We’re not sure if Maduro running under a campaign that is 
pitching him as the next Chavez is the best thing for him; he’s 
clearly threatened by his opposition if he’s using curses as a 
bargaining chip. It’ll be interesting to see who wins Venezuela’s 
upcoming election.

Misconceptions about the UFApps 
service in April 5 article
An article published in the April 5 issue 
of the Alligator contained some misinforma-
tion about the UFApps service. On behalf of UF Information Technology, I would like to clarify these issues.
1. UFApps does not mean “free soft-
ware.”
UFApps is a pilot service funded by the 
Student Technology Fee and administered by UFIT. The university negotiates software agreements to cover usage in classrooms, labs and administrative units. Software available through UFApps is licensed and provided for use in a virtual environment.
2. There are no technical difﬁ  culties with 
UFApps.
No technical problems have been reported 
with any applications. UFApps provides stu-dents access to licensed software from almost any computing device anywhere there’s an Internet connection. Student feedback about UFApps has been overwhelmingly positive.
3. UF’s Adobe licenseUFIT has written permission from Ado-
be to include their applications in UFApps, which were initially available when the service launched March 12. Subsequent to launch, Adobe raised some licensing ques-tions for discussion. As a gesture of good faith toward those discussions, UFIT removed the Adobe applications from UFApps. Our dis-
cussions with Adobe are positive and on-
going. We hope to have the issue resolved shortly.
The reporter stated that, due to the un-
availability of Adobe via UFApps, students are “resorting to older version of the pro-grams and cracked software to complete their assignments.”This is an excellent opportunity to remind 
students that lawful use of software, media and all intellectual property is a core value of our university. Improperly acquired or un-licensed software puts you at legal risk. For more information, I encourage students to 
read the university’s Acceptable Use Policy.
Microsoft OneNote and InfoPath 2010 
have been added since UFApps’ launch last 
month. We look forward to expanding and enhancing this student pilot.

Letter to the Editor
At the end of last month, an oil pipeline ruptured in cen-
tral Arkansas. According to CNN, 12,000 barrels of oil spilled into the state. Homes were evacuated, and resi-
dential streets were ﬁ  lled with ﬂ  owing, black oil.
The culprit behind this lack of pipe maintenance is none 
other than the infamous ExxonMobil.
Put yourself in the shoes of one of the victims of this acci-
dent. Imagine the river of black ﬁ  lth running on and on through your streets and home.
The most frustrating part of the spill is the response of the 
government. Government leaders, the ones who pledge to up-
hold liberty, are often stunningly uncaring when it comes ad-
dressing the errors of oil companies, and this is no exception.
Exxon won’t have to pay a penny toward the fund used to 
clean up oil spills because the black rivers aren’t technically oil. This is because, according to the Internal Revenue Service, “tar sands” are not the same as “conventional oil.” 
Despite this, Exxon said it will do its best to take care of ev-
erything. According to RT news, Alan Jeffers, Exxon media re-lations manager, said Exxon is “paying all valid claims relating 
to the spill and providing interim housing for people from the 
homes which the city of Mayﬂ  ower recommended be evacu-ated following Friday’s spill.”
That sounds awfully responsible. It also sounded respon-sible when Exxon promised to make safety a priority after the Valdez incident years ago. That incident would have originally cost Exxon $5 billion, but the rate was ﬁ  nally reduced to a mere $500 million in court. I wonder what Exxon will consider to be “valid claims” this time.
The Arkansas attorney general was repeatedly told by Exx-
on that “inspections were up to date and showed no cause for concern,” according to an NPR article. Look at how that turned out, though. According to one article, the nation’s pipelines on average have 280 signiﬁ  cant spills each year.
The relationship our country has with oil is a strange one. 
We see it as essential to our daily lives. Our food, transporta-tion and even our plastics all depend somehow on oil.
And yet, most of us recognize the harm oil can do to the en-
vironment. Oil can be very toxic. Spills can cause widespread harm to wildlife and commerce, and using oil as fuel releases greenhouse gases.
Some places, like cities, are even built with the expectation 
travel will primarily take place in a car. Not only are roads in-accessible to other vehicles, but the cities are built so far spread 
out that it’s hardly feasible to even live in such a place without 
a car. We all need to get from place to place. Yet, it seems im-possible to give up oil. What could be the solution?
We must admit to ourselves we are truly doing a moral wrong when we use oil. We have to remind ourselves what we’re doing can hurt us.
The next step, I think, is to try 
to wean ourselves off oil. The less 
we use, the better. Carpooling is 
better than driving alone, busing is better than carpooling and bik-ing is even better. If more people bike, roads will be much safer for 
bikes.
If you’re really ambitious, look into converting your car into 
a completely electric car. Think of where your food is produced 
and how it’s transported. Think of how much money we can save, as a country, if we would stop with these oil wars. No more would there be the need for ﬁ  ghting and digging around in the sand.
Most of all, think of what would happen if we all really 
wanted clean energy — if we really invested our time, money and minds into it. Imagine a future where we are so efﬁ  cient 
at extracting energy,  we would actually greet hurricanes with 
open arms! We just have to do it.

Watching a river otter trying 
to turn flips in muddy, 5-inch-
deep water almost made Dawn Fox cry.
But Fox, a former volun-
teer with Florida Wildlife Care Center, said she was only al-lowed to change the water in the child’s size plastic pool once a week.
“It really brought tears to 
my eyes to see that poor little guy in that filthy, dirty water,” she said. “The bottom line is that it was a poor setup.”
But since the Florida Fish 
and Wildlife Conservation Commission charged Leslie Straub, the owner of the center, on Sept. 5 with failing to com-ply with animal neglect rules, a lot has changed.
Now, Fox said, the otter 
swims in a tank of sparkling water at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, where he will live permanently.
“I can rest easy to know he’s 
in a wonderful environment,” she said.
As of March 27, Straub is 
facing a two-year deferred 
prosecution agreement instead 
of criminal charges, and her li-cense to care for wild animals has been suspended for three years.
Normally, deferred prosecu-
tion only suspends the charges for a year, said Ken Holmes, a Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-servation Commission investi-gator. The agreement gives the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission inspec-
tion rights to Straub’s home for two years, allowing investiga-tors to make sure she doesn’t have any wild animals on her property. If she complies, the charges will be dropped.
Holmes said he was willing 
to give her deferred prosecu-
tion because she didn’t have a 
criminal history, and she had been rehabbing since 1995.
“She did a lot of good for 
a lot of years,” he said. “Obvi-
ously, she wasn’t doing what 
she should lately.”
Meanwhile, animals that 
were formerly in Straub’s care have been passed on to other organizations.
Rehabilitators typically have 
niches of animals they work with, Holmes said, but Straub  took in a wide variety. Now that Straub is out of the picture, Fox said it’s exposing just how far the wildlife rehabilitation system has to go.
“We’ve always had the 
void,” she said. “People just 
didn’t know about it.”
Some of Straub’s former vol-
unteers are using Florida Wild-
life Care as a call center to help connect people with injured animals to rehabbers.
Volunteers like Amy Mor-
ton, 28, are also working to put together a web of foster homes 
to give residents options.
“A lot of people don’t know 
where to turn to when they find 
an injured animal,” she said.

The opening ceremony of the 
From One Witness to Another: 
Genocide Awareness Series began Sunday on Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza.
The series will continue through 
Wednesday as UF Hillel recogniz-es Genocide Awareness Month.
Genocide is traditionally de-
fined as the deliberate killing of a large group of people, particularly those of a particular ethnic group or nation.
During the opening ceremony, 
UF students Sarah Pila, a 22-year-old psychology senior; Kimmie Klaiman, a 20-year-old economics and family, youth and community sciences senior; and Stefani Pila, a 22-year-old history major; read testimonies of survivors from the 
Armenian genocide, the Rwan-
dan genocide and the Cambodian 
genocide. UF Hillel Rabbi Daniel 
Wolnerman spoke about being the grandson of Holocaust survivors.
The series is an effort to inform 
the community of the acts of ha-tred that have occurred in 43 coun-tries, Sarah Pila said.
“I think it’s very special that 
here at the University of Florida, we’re able to not only acknowl-edge the Holocaust, which af-fected predominantly the Jewish 
population, but also able to incor-
porate that into the larger scheme of genocide awareness,” Wolner-man said.
Five candles were lit to com-
memorate the billions of deaths. White ribbons were handed out to represent people lost to genocide.
“It’s important because we al-
ways say, ‘Never again,’ and it’s still happening,” said Katie Gillen, a 21-year-old UF telecommunica-tion senior. Hillel raises genocide awareness
�FACULTY COULD USE IT TO HELP GRADE ESSAYS.
KELSEY WONDERLIN

UF students waiting for grades to be uploaded might be 
able to stop refreshing e-Learning.
EdX has introduced an online learning system that scores 
students’ essays using artificial intelligence. The program of-
fers free courses to any institution that wants to use it, accord-
ing to the edX website.Michele Traub, a UF graduate instructor for applied behav-
ior analysis, is skeptical of such a computer-based grading sys-
tem. She said programs like this tend to look for key terms in 
students’ responses without considering their context.
“For me, I like to see what people are understanding,” she 
said. 
Claudia Weeks, an 18-year-old UF sociology freshman, said she hates the similar system used in online psychology.
“It will give you a bad grade for overusing words like 
‘brain,’ which has no synonyms,” she said. “But if my teacher 
was actually grading it, she obviously wouldn’t take points off for that.”
Caroline Stone, lecturer for advanced argumentative writ-
ing in the UF English department, said many students already complain about the lack of attention and feedback they get from professors in their online classes. She believes an artificial 
intelligence system would further disadvantage students.
“We, as faculty, have a responsibility to take the time to give 
students quality feedback on their writing,” she said.Digitized, instant essay grading: Would it work at UF?TARYN TACHER

One UF student is competing to win the 
New York Job Project, a contest geared to-
ward people with a passion for public rela-tions and social media. Affect, a firm in New 
York City, is hosting the contest to find the most qualified applicant to fill the position of 
account coordinator.
“It’s better than sending in a resume and 
biting your nails and hoping they like it,” said 
Hannah Swerdloff, a 22-year-old UF public 
relations senior and entrant in the contest.
There are currently 33 entries, but ap-
plications will still be accepted until Friday. Swerdloff is in third place.
“Contests like this are awesome because 
they allow candidates to put themselves out there,” Swerdloff said.
Maria Parra, a career ambassador for the 
Career Resource Center and 22-year-old UF business administration senior, said the job market is a lot more competitive than ever before, and applicants need to do as much as possible to stand out.
“Contests like the New York Job Project give students the ability to apply what they’ve learned in school so far in a real-world set-ting,” Parra said. “It’s about going above and beyond just getting good grades.”
The entrants promote their pages through 
social media. The goal is to get the most votes. There are five judges who each have 200 votes to give out to contestants they deem deserving. Of the three finalists, one will earn the job with Affect with a starting salary of $36,000. UF senior uses social media to compete for a public relations job

sprain since the first week of practice. Wideout Latroy 
Pittman did not dress for Saturday, and Solomon Patton continues to be held out of contact as he recovers from a broken arm.
The offensive line was hit even harder. Guard Jon 
Halapio (knee) and tackle Chaz Green (ankle) both sat out after undergoing exploratory surgeries in January. Tackle Ian Silberman missed the game due to a shoul-der injury, and tackle Trip Thurman underwent surgery on Monday to repair a torn labrum. Guard Jessamen Dunker is indefinitely suspended as he faces charges of felony grand theft auto and misdemeanor driving with a suspended license.
The six healthy linemen were forced to play nearly 
every snap of both the drills and scrimmages.  
“It was really tough,” tackle Tyler Moore said. “We 
tried to do our best, tried to get breaks, but it wasn’t much.”
Moore and Harrison said the healthy lineman took 
the extra snaps as an opportunity to get better and build toughness.
Given all the unit has gone through, a sloppy perfor-
mance Saturday is excusable.
“We did pretty good,” Moore said. “Day 15, do-
ing the same thing we’ve done all fricking spring. No breaks, doing all the reps. Trying to work as hard as we can.”
Although Saturday’s lackluster showing conjures 
memories of UF ranking outside the NCAA’s top 100 in total offense for two consecutive seasons, coaches and players remain optimistic.
Coach Will Muschamp said he was comfortable 
with the talent and depth of UF’s offensive line, espe-cially when healthy. He expects improvement from the receivers and a step forward from Driskel, who will be entering his second season as a starter. The Gators also enter 2013 with a year of experience under offensive co-ordinator Brent Pease.
While Saturday’s events were low in entertainment 
value, Muschamp called it “a very productive day.”
“It didn’t really feel like a game, but we had to be-
cause we’re so low in numbers,” Harrison said. “There’s a lot of hope. There’s a lot of room for opportunity com-ing up in the season.”
Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org.catch.  
Herndon added a touchdown as 
well. 
Jones said he has looked to mentor 
Taylor as the freshman continues to de-velop a better understanding of his re-sponsibilities on the field and his play-book knowledge. 
Last year, Jones sought the advice 
of Gillislee as he adjusted to the college game. 
“Me and him will watch film all the 
time together,” Jones said of his relation-ship with Taylor.
“We teach each other how we run the ball, what we missed on this play, 
(and) the concept of the play.”
Although Muschamp has spoken at 
length about the importance of becom-
ing balanced offensively, Florida’s rush-ing attack will be pivotal to its success again next season. 
Florida finished 11-2 in 2012-13 
largely because of its ground attack, which finished third in the Southeastern 
Conference with 187.7 yards per game. 
Jones, who carried the ball just 52 
times for 275 yards and three touch-
downs, will step into the role vacated by Gillislee’s departure for the NFL. 
“He’s going to be huge for us,” junior 
quarterback Jeff Driskel said.“He’s a guy who can run hard and 
break away when he’s in the open field. He’s also great at pass protecting. He knows his assignments well, and he’s good when he gets in space running check-down routes or option routes.
“He’s definitely a versatile guy that 
we’re going to have to rely a lot this year like we did with Mike last year.” 
Jones added: “It made me humble 
and definitely hungry sitting behind Mike. … It was probably the best move I ever could have did. Not even starting over him. I wanted to sit behind him to learn how he ran the ball.”

HALFBACKS , from page 14
lack of a game wasn’t news on 
Saturday.
After 38,100 attended last 
year’s Orange and Blue Debut, Saturday’s “game” could not have drawn much more than 15,000 people.
Roughly 23,000 folks got the 
message and stayed home.
And for those who did show 
up, the UAA was extremely gen-erous. Admission was free. For 
those who bought advance tick-
ets, money was refunded.
Muschamp got on the mi-
crophone and talked the crowd 
through the phases of Florida’s 
practice. It was boring as hell, but at least they were trying.
The Gators could have easily 
canceled the Orange and Blue De-but and just had another closed 
practice. That’s probably what I 
would have done.
Instead, Florida catered to its 
fans and tried to make its final 
spring practice as entertaining as possible. If you ever wanted to see Dominique Easley do his 
thing with some mindless Pitbull song playing, Saturday was prob-ably Christmas morning for you.
Spring games exist entirely for 
the fans. The team could do just fine without them each year.
Granted, players love the 
crowd, too, but they get the pay-off of adoring fans during the 
regular season. Spring is a time 
for work.
I’m sure Muschamp would 
have loved to simply hold an-other closed practice. But even 
though it was a hassle, he went 
ahead with Saturday’s “game” at The Swamp. For you.
“We’ve got the greatest fans 
in the world,” Muschamp said Tuesday. “To be able to perform in front of them is important for our guys.”
Undoubtedly, the spring 
“game” sucked. But for you foot-ball-starved fiends out there, it was better than nothing.

 Matt Jones has staked his claim to Flori-
da’s starting tailback spot. 
  After being used sparingly behind Mike 
Gillislee last season, he used a productive 
spring to distance himself from freshman 
Kelvin Taylor and junior Mack Brown. 
  Jones was so 
proliﬁ  c during 
Florida’s 14 spring practices that 
coach Will Muschamp was economic with the sophomore during the Gators’ spring game on Saturday, opting instead to take a closer look at Brown and Taylor, as well as 
walk-on Mark Herndon. 
  “Matt didn’t do a whole lot today, and 
that was by design,” Muschamp said. “We 
wanted to get Kelvin and Mack and Mark some touches. Matt’s had a really out-standing spring. We have a good comfort level of where he is as a player.”
  Given the number of injuries Florida 
has dealt with along the offensive line, the Gators sprinkled in multiple drills in ad-dition to six scrimmage periods on Satur-
day. 
  Jones was a light participant in the drills 
and had an unofﬁ  cial carry for 8 yards dur-
ing the ﬁ  rst scrimmage period. Otherwise, the 6-foot-2 sophomore did not see much work. 
  “I had a strong spring, and also they 
wanted to get some of the young guys a lot of reps,” Jones said.
“They kind of took it easy on me to-
day.” 
  Taylor responded well in his debut at 
Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. He unofﬁ  cially carried the ball 11 times for 59 yards and a touchdown, while also adding a 3-yard

  Junior quarterback Jeff Driskel (6) takes a snap during a drill in Saturday’s Orange and Blue Debut at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium. The event marked the end of Florida’s spring practice. 
  The Gators’ spring “game” on Satur-
day was boring.
  Trust me. I know. I had to be 
there.
  Most fans went to Saturday’s “game” 
with reasonable expectations. But an irate few were upset after watching just 
a regular old practice on Saturday in The 
Swamp. Several aired their grievances via social media.
  What? Did the lack of an ultimately 
meaningless football game bother you?
  You had plenty of advance warning.  Coach Will Muschamp ﬁ  rst addressed 
the possibility of a format change to the Orange and Blue Debut on March 26 — 11 days before the “game.”
  “It may be more of a practice-like at-
mosphere for what we’re going to do,” he said.
  Since only six Florida offensive line-
men were healthy enough to practice, 
Muschamp decided not to make six guys 
man the offensive lines of both the Or-ange and Blue teams.  That would 
mean 70 snaps in the Gainesville 
heat for six guys 
who have to hit somebody on every play. If 
I were in Mus-
champ’s shoes, I would have made the 
same decision.
  So not only did Muschamp make a 
perfectly rational decision, but he gave 
fair warning.
  But just in case his ﬁ  rst warning wasn’t 
enough, Muschamp decided to make it 
ofﬁ  cial on April 2 — four days before the “game.”
  “It’s not fair to go in a spring game 
situation and ask [the offensive linemen] to take 60, 70 snaps in a row,” Muschamp said Tuesday. “That’s not healthy. It’s not good. It’s not good for our football 
team.”
  There’s your second warning. The  Spring ‘game’ was what it wasFIRE JOE MORGAN

 Under the weight of injuries and attrition, Flor-
ida’s offense stumbled to the spring practice ﬁ  nish 
line on Saturday in The Swamp.
  With only six healthy offensive linemen, the 
Gators could not even attempt a typical spring game. Instead, the Orange and Blue Debut was Florida’s 15th and ﬁ  nal spring practice, and a sloppy one at that.
  During the six 11-on-11 scrimmage periods that 
separated individual drills, quarterback Jeff Driskel struggled. He consistently waited through would-be sacks — a red non-contact jersey bought him extra time — but rarely found an open man.
  UF also dealt with drops and bad snaps as the 
defense seemed to get the better of the offense from start to ﬁ  nish.
  “There were a lot of sloppy parts,” center Jonot-
than Harrison said. “We weren’t seeing much of the 
mental errors or anything during all of these prac-
tices. But it could’ve been from people already being done with spring ball.”
  That the offense would be looking to simply es-
cape is understandable.

Robinson both showed ﬂ  ashes, each was held out of contact on Saturday. Dunbar has a shoulder injury, while Robinson has been playing through a left ankle  Florida concludes spring work with open practiceGORDON STREISAND

Dubbed by many at UF as “the most excit-
ing couple of minutes in racing,” the 4x400m 
relays highlight the Florida Relays. The event was the catalyst that drove Florida to multiple national championships. 
Traditionally the finale for many track 
meets, the 4x400s have long been a point of emphasis for the Gators. 
“The 4x400 is kind of the signature event 
for us and we always like to close the meet with it,” coach Mike Holloway said on Satur-day.
“It’s the last thing anyone sees of us, so we 
want to go out with a great effort.” 
It’s a theme that’s been pervasive in Hol-
loway’s tenure at UF. 
“We talk about that a lot, how the 4x4 is the 
last thing people see at the meet, and it’s what they remember you by,” Holloway said at the Razorback Invitational in January.
The 4x400s have taken on a certain mys-
tique at Florida over the years, thanks in part to the men’s battle hymn, “Oh, I Gotta Go.”
The tradition began in 1995, Holloway’s 
first year as an assistant coach with Florida. Robert Covington, a sprinter at the time, learned the song from his brother who was in the military and, soon after, taught the song to his teammates. To this day, the song is sung by Florida’s athletes immediately preceding the start of the men’s 4x4.
“There’s a lot of pride in the relay at the University of Florida,” Holloway said. “That’s been a tradition as long as I’ve been here.”
On Saturday, Florida’s men finished sec-
ond in the 4x4. The first-place squad featured Olympian and former Gator Tony McQuay as the anchor.
“It’s all about effort,” said Holloway. “We 
were right in the middle of heavy training. I asked them to go out and engage in the fight tonight, engage in the party. And they did that. They were running against professional athletes, Olympians in Jeremy Wariner and Tony McQuay. We did well.” 
“We thought we did pretty good,” Florida 
anchor Arman Hall said. “We did the best we could in front of our fans. We were supported 
by our great teammates. Sure we’re sad, we 
could have won [the race], but we’ve just got to work harder and hopefully beat them next time. We know we’re just as good as they are, but again they got us for today. Who knows, we might get them next time if we face them off.”
The women were also runners-up in their 
4x4, also losing to a post-collegiate squad fea-
turing Olympic gold medalist Moushaumi 
Robinson. Although the women didn’t win the event, they did break a longstanding UF record and still hold the fastest time in the NCAA.
“The women went out and broke a school 
record that people thought was unbreak-able,” Holloway said. “I’m incredibly proud of them.”
Anchor Ebony Eutsey added: “It feels great. 
Our team is young here. We have two fresh-men on this team, so for freshman to be able to step up and take that record is a good thing. It means a lot to all of us. It’s just great.”
Holloway deemed this year’s Florida Re-
lays another chapter in the Gators’ 4x400 relay history.
“We had numerous PR’s, numerous sea-
sonal bests, school records,” said Holloway. “It was an unbelievable weekend.”MONDAY, APRIL 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Danielle Collins played with mo-
mentum on Sunday.
The freshman smacked a ball to 
the side of Lien Van Geel’s court to 
end her singles match 6-3 and clinch 
a 4-0 Florida victory against Missis-
sippi State on Sunday at Linder Sta-dium.
Collins said starting strong made 
the difference.
She came out in the first set, 
dominating the rhythm of play. The freshman only dropped one game to Van Geel, a trip up at the net. She held the lead and grabbed the easy 6-1 win in the first.
Coach Roland Thornqvist said 
Collins’ confidence is growing and its apparent each time she comes out on the court.
Florida honored seniors Lauren 
Embree and Caroline Hitimana for the team’s senior day. 
Despite both players’ success on 
the court during the past four years, the seniors were not in top form af-ter being honored.
Embree came out fast in her first 
set in singles, dominating the court. But the senior lost focus and her op-
ponent, Georgiana Patrasc took ad-
vantage of it.
“[Patrasc] started attacking my 
short balls and putting away balls to make it tougher for me,” Embree said.
Pastrasc wore Embree down in 
the first three games of the second set and grabbed two more games 
for a two-point lead. Embree battled back and closed the gap to 5-4, but 
Patrasc won the sixth point and forced a third set. The set went un-
finished due to Collins’ clincher.
“Maybe it was the emotion of 
being a senior, and that could cloud 
your mind for sure,” Thornqvist said. “[Embree] learned a little bit of a lesson. With SECs and NCAAs coming up, you have to take care of your own business on the court.” 
Hitimana came out slow in her 
first set, but fought up court to grab a win at 6-4. She led the second set 3-1 before it went unfinished.
“I was hoping that both our se-
niors would be able to finish today, but we came away with a team win and that’s more important than any-thing,” Thornqvist said.
Despite Embree and Hitimana’s 
struggles, Olivia Janowicz and Alex Cercone grabbed the first singles wins, giving the Gators a 3-0 lead.
Sofie Oyen’s match went unfin-
ished in the third set.
Doubles provided a quick vic-
tory against the Bulldogs.
Cercone and Hitimana shut out 
Patrasc and Roseline Dion 8-0.
The Bulldogs pairing tripped up 
on serves and gave the Gators easy final two games to win it all.
Embree and Oyen grabbed the 
doubles point in an uncontested last game, when Tran hit the ball out in the Gators’ left corner.
Thornqvist said the team is in a 
good place heading into its final two 
regular season matches.
“I think our form is like a good 
stock chart,” Thornqvist said. “From 
bottom-left to top-right, that’s what you try to do as the year evolves. We’re playing more consistent and that’s what it takes if we want to re-alize our dreams.”

When All-American Alaina 
Johnson stuck her first vault 
routine in 85 days, the Gators were relieved. 
No. 1 Florida (20-2, 7-1 
Southeastern Conference) has dealt with injuries through-out the season, and that trend continued prior to the NCAA Regional Championships on Saturday.  
After Johnson suffered a 
stress fracture in her lower back on Jan. 18, the Gators saw 
another injury to a key gym-
nast just a week before its most important competition. 
Randy Stageberg — a main-
stay on balance beam and floor — suffered a dislocated shoul-der during practice on March 29. Coach Rhonda Faehn de-scribed it as a “freak accident”. 
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
the injury will sideline Stage-berg for the rest of the season. 
On the eve of the NCAA 
Regional Championships, it was also unclear whether All-American Mackenzie Caquatto would be in the rotation. 
“We had a very challenging 
week,” Faehn said. “Starting out with losing Randy Stage-berg to a dislocated shoulder, and she was a starter for us on two events.
“And then Macko hav-
ing an emergency root canal 
last night and throwing up 
all morning and not knowing if she was going to be able to go was really making things a little sketchy heading into to-night.”
But the injuries have not 
discouraged the Gators.
With an already deep ros-
ter, Florida hurdled health is-sues to several of its All-Amer-icans to capture its seventh Regional Championship in the past eight years. 
UF earned a score of 
198.400 — the second highest total in the nation this season — to clinch its 31st berth to the 
NCAA Championships.
A collective effort on each 
apparatus helped the Gators 
register a score of 49.55 or high-er on each of the four events, including a 49.60 total on the vault that featured Johnson for the first time since Jan. 18. 
Johnson pinned a 9.925 de-
spite limited preparation. 
“This team is incredible,” 
Johnson said. “They have pushed me through practices ,and they have helped me get back.”

Through four innings on Sunday, it 
looked as if Florida was going to have a 
showing identical to its 2-0 loss to Missis-sippi State on Saturday.
Then the lineup woke up.
The Gators (15-18, 5-7 Southeastern 
Conference) used an eight-run fifth to beat 
No. 17 Mississippi State (26-9, 5-7 SEC) 8-3 
in Starkville, Miss.
On Saturday, 
UF only had four batters above the 
minimum and did not get an extra-base hit.  Until the fifth inning of Game 3, only 
one Gator had reached base against Bull-
dogs’ starter Jacob Lindgren.
The sophomore left-hander gave up 
three straight singles to Vickash Ramjit, Josh Tobias and Harrison Bader to be-gin the top of the fifth. Lindgren was re-placed with right-hander Myles Gentry. O’Sullivan countered by pinch-hitting for Mike Fahrman with lefty Connor Mitchell. 
Mitchell proceeded to clear the bases with 
a triple down the right-field line. 
Cody Dent followed Mitchell with a walk and freshman shortstop Richie Mar-tin then singled to left to score Mitchell for the go-ahead run. Sophomore third base-
man Tobias plated two more runs later 
in the inning with a double to left field to make it 8-2.
Sophomore Johnny Magliozzi, who un-
til yesterday had primarily been used as a closer, got the start for Florida. After allow-ing two runs in the first inning, Magliozzi retired nine straight and lasted 5.2 innings total while allowing one more run.
Ryan Harris relieved Magliozzi and 
struck out Bulldogs’ catcher Mitch Slau-ter to get out of the sixth. The sophomore right-hander pitched two more scoreless innings. It was Harris’ second outing in as many days in which he threw 2.1 innings without giving up a run. 
MSU threatened in the bottom of the 
ninth with back-to-back singles from Wes 
Rea and CT Bradford to lead off the inning. 
Daniel Gibson then came in for Harris and retired the final three batters in order.
Florida will look to avoid a season 
sweep against No. 8 Florida State when it travels to Tallahassee on Tuesday night.

Florida’s trademark in 2013 has 
been scoring early and often.
But on Sunday, it was Mississip-
pi State hanging crooked numbers 
on the scoreboard.
The Bulldogs (24-14. 3-9 South-
eastern Conference) jumped out to a five-run lead in the second in-ning and held on to defeat the No. 3 Gators (38-4, 12-3 SEC) 6-5 at Ka-tie Seashole Pressly Stadium to end Florida’s 12-game winning streak.“They had 11 hits, we had [five],” 
sophomore Lauren Haeger said. “It’s hard to win when the other team has 
11 hits and you have [five].”
After pitching a scoreless first, ju-
nior Hannah Rogers fell apart in the 
second. The right-hander surren-dered a leadoff home run to Missis-sippi State designated player Briana Bell and never regained her control. 
Bulldogs second baseman Heidi 
Shape followed with a triple and 
scored on a single by Erin Nesbit. 
MSU scored five in the inning.
“I don’t think anything was working for her,” coach Tim Walton said. “I think she was throwing the 
ball over the plate 
too much.”
But after fall-
ing behind early, 
the Gators rallied.
Kelsey Hor-
ton and Taylor Schwarz began the bottom of the second with 
singles, and Briana Little walked to load the bases. 
Following a Kirsti Merritt popout, catcher Taylore Fuller, who came into the game batting .179, worked a 2-2 count. After crushing a foul 
ball left of the left-field foul pole, the 
freshman kept a long ball fair, bring-ing in four runs for Florida.
“It feels better to produce for my 
team, finally,” Fuller said. “I would have gone with a base hit, but a grand slam is that much better.”
But MSU stalled UF’s momen-
tum and tacked on a sixth run in the 
top of the third on a single by center 
fielder Loryn Nichols. Shape scored on the play, colliding with Fuller at the plate. The ball rolled to the back-stop, where pitcher Alyssa Bache fielded it and threw to Fuller, who 
tagged Nesbit out to end the inning.
The Gators added a fifth run in 
the sixth inning on a home run by 
Horton, but went down in order to finish the game in the seventh.
“Being down 5-0 in softball is 
like being down four touchdowns in football,” Walton said. “We did a good job at keeping it competitive 
and keeping it close.”
