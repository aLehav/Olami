on University Avenue in February.

This summer, one of Gainesville’s oldest fan shops 
will transform into a modern, music-thumping bar.
For 28 years, Gator Shop’s walls were lined with UF 
paraphernalia: T-shirts, toddler cheerleading uniforms 
and national championship posters from the Urban 
Meyer era — even tins of coffee grounds with Albert 
and Alberta printed on the label.
Now, it’s a bare, broken-down space that will be 
home to a new Midtown bar by summertime.
On March 4, the family-owned store, located on the 
corner of the UF Plaza at Midtown closed its doors.
The business won’t close forever, though, said Amy 
Ritch, a partial owner of Gator Shop. She said the fam-ily would like to reopen the shop on Archer Road or 
Newberry Road, but it has not found a location. The on-
line store, gatorshop.com, will continue to do business.
J.D. Chester, owner of Munchies 420 Cafe, is subleas-
ing the 2,100-square-foot space from the store owners. Construction on the new bar, which Chester said will be named Four Twenty , has already begun. He hopes to open it in June or July.
He said he is turning it into a “classy bar” for stu-
dents.
“I always see all these girls in nice dresses and high 
heels walking through Midtown, and they wind up standing on tables,” Chester said. “This bar will be dif-ferent.”
Managing Gator Shop became difﬁ  cult after the rent 
increased in 2009, Ritch said.
The store is in the heart of an area that is known for 
its college nightlife.
“It just wasn’t feasible to sell T-shirts there any-Gator Shop closes its doors to make way for bar

Eighty-one students sat silently in the 
Florida Gym on Monday night as their 
professor presented evidence of 97 stu-dents cheating in his computer course.
Manuel Bermudez, an associate pro-
fessor in the College of Engineering’s department of computer and informa-tion science and engineering, said there were 242 instances of cheating on the ﬁ  rst exam of his CGS2531 class.
Students were required to turn in six 
projects online from Feb. 21 to Feb. 22 as their exam. An instructor and a teaching assistant caught the issue.Bermudez said project ﬁ  les turned in 
for the exam contained hidden markers that helped identify documents used in old exams. If markers from one or more documents appeared on more than one student’s ﬁ  le, that is proof of cheating.
“The evidence is 100 percent irrefut-
able,” he said.
In an email sent Friday, Bermudez 
gave suspected students their options: Students could accept responsibility, ac-cept responsibility but challenge the pen-alty, deny responsibility or do nothing.
Students who accept responsibility 
will receive zeroes on the exam, suffer 5 percent grade deductions and will not be 
able to drop the class.

The Gainesville City Commission will dis-
cuss Thursday whether to allow alcohol to be 
sold in an outdoor parking lot downtown.
If it does, Gainesville business owners be-
lieve the change will be a draw for more down-
town outdoor concerts and events.
The amended ordinances would allow the 
sale and consumption of alcohol in a parking 
lot at Southwest First Avenue and Northwest Second Street.
Tony Weinbender, founder of Fest, an an-
nual three-day music festival in Gainesville, told the Gainesville Public Safety Committee on Feb. 29 that if the city OKs the sale of alco-
hol in a downtown parking lot, he would hold 
a new event in that location in the middle of May.
During Thursday’s meeting, the commis-
sion will also discuss allowing outdoor food vendors to keep their businesses open until 3 a.m. instead of 11 p.m.
Jeff Babik, owner of a food truck on Univer-
sity Avenue in downtown Gainesville, said in a proposal he wrote to the commission that most of his income comes from young adults who go to downtown and Midtown bars.
He said the dense food sold by the trucks 
could beneﬁ  t bar-goers.
“It is debatable,” Babik said in the proposal, 
“but many would say that these food vendors help sober up intoxicated adults and potential drunk drivers by putting food in their stom-achs.”

When Joey Sasvari graduated from UF’s Entre-
preneurship Master’s program in 2009, he wanted to 
start a business and save the world.
Sasvari imagined a social game like Facebook’s 
FarmVille that lets users control a virtual African vil-
lage. The idea became Raise the Village, a free iPhone 
application that delivers aid to Ugandan village Ka-pir Atira.
When users spend money, it goes directly to the 
village.
Sasvari and Cameron MacMillan, another UF 
Entrepreneurship graduate, formed New Charity Era in 2010. They brought on former classmate and Ugandan native Biko Evarist. Then the team went to 
Uganda.
Evarist gave Sasvari and MacMillen village tours 
in March 2010, and they assessed village needs. They 
chose Kapir Atira as the recipient of aid from the game.
Sasvari, New Charity Era COO, remembered the 
villagers’ smiles.
“What was amazing, I thought, was they were all 
so nice and happy,” he said. “And you would think 
the way and lifestyle in which they live every day , 
you would come across some people that were in a bad mood.”In its ﬁ  rst week on Apple’s App Store in December 
2010, the game was featured under “What’s New.” It 
has been downloaded more than 300,000 times, Sas-
vari said.
His favorite feature is the constant visual updates 
users receive about how their money is spent.
Raise the Village has funded four deliveries of 
food, supplies and scholarships to Kapir Atira villag-ers, totaling about $5,000. The team only buys goods from Uganda to help its economy . Evarist is in charge 
of deliveries.
Renata Serra, lecturer in economics and develop-
ment for UF’s Center for African Studies, was im-
pressed when she learned about Raise the Village.
“I’m fascinated by the whole concept of making 
an app with social implications,” she said. “At the same time, I think we have to be careful not to let consumers think that just by buying an app you can change the world.”
New Charity Era is developing a Facebook ver-
sion of the game, which should be released in July , said MacMillan, the organization’s CEO.Grads make app to support village

This March marks the country’s 
24th Women’s History Month. 
The Women’s Student Association will host multiple events to cel-ebrate, including a global business 
etiquette seminar and the second 
Masculine Mystique Panel.
Annie Boggs, WSA’s Women’s 
History Month director, said this is UF’s 17th year celebrating the month.
The ﬁ  rst main event the WSA 
will host is the second annual Mas-culine Mystique Panel, which will 
take place Wednesday at 7 p.m. 
Boggs said a panel of male stu-
dents will gather in Ustler Hall to talk about women’s issues, mascu-
linity taboos — such as showing emotion in public and pressure to ﬁ  t a masculine mold — and their perspectives on dating.
WSA will also host a global 
business etiquette seminar called the Global Dish at 7 p.m. on March 20 in Ustler Hall. Speakers will in-struct people how to greet profes-sionals from other countries and how to bridge the cultural divide in business.
Boggs said that though this is 
the WSA’s ﬁ  rst year on campus 
after replacing the Women’s Lead-
ership Council, the organization is looking forward to a productive Women’s History Month.
“There isn’t an emphasis on 
women’s events the rest of the year,” she said. “It’s the one month when women’s issues are forefront on campus.”UF celebrates 17th

If students do not accept responsibility , they will be referred

Computer science and engineering students Nuri Yeralan,

students in his class.
“I took it a little personal,” he said. “I even begged my stu-
dents not to cheat. It kind of sucks.”
Yeralan said he warned students one week before the exam 
about the project markers through in-class announcements and 
on the course website.
Julie Rothe, an 18-year-old finance and information systems 
freshman, said she plans to accept responsibility . But she will challenge the penalty, she said, because students cheated in 
years past.

Visitors enjoy the opening of the MASS Visual Arts semi-annual art show at the Top Secret Space on Saturday. The exhibit 
showcases artwork presenting interpretations of the theme, “Below the Belt.” It will be open Saturdays from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Sundays noon to 6 p.m. until the closing reception on March 30. For more information, visit massvisualarts.org.
Business down since last championship
more,” she said. “The space demands 
more business. A bar or a restaurant will bring that business in.”
Chester said he has been planning 
on opening a bar in the area for the 
past few months. 
He has already purchased 10 fro-
zen drink machines, so frozen alco-
holic beverages like strawberry dai-quiris and piña coladas will be on the drink menu.
There will also be a martini bar 
and an adjacent counter where beer and liquor will be served. The new 
establishment will also have a dance 
floor and a small outdoor area in front, Chester said. Patrons will be able to walk upstairs to Munchies 420 Cafe to buy food.
Since Gator Shop has been a home 
away from home for Ritch and her 
family for the past three decades, she 
said she wished a bar didn’t have to take its spot.Sport success also plays into how 
much money the store makes.
She said business has been tough 
since 2008 — the last time the Gators won a national football champion-ship.
Joe Fincher, Ritch’s father and an-
other part owner of the store, bought Gator Shop in 1984. It was the only Gators fan shop located in Midtown. Neither Gators Plus nor the Florida Book Store existed at the time.
The store was originally located 
two stores north in the UF Plaza, where Pita Pit is now, but Fincher moved Gator Shop to its current lo-cation in 1986. The family has run it ever since.
Fincher’s three daughters gradu-ated from UF. Two married football players from the 1996 national cham-pionship football team.
Loyal customers said they will 
miss Gator Shop and its fandom.
Gator alumni Lester and Vicky 
Rachel were driving through Gainesville on March 4 when they 
stopped in to buy some merchandise 
and heard the news.
“The faithful ones always get left 
behind,” said Lester Rachel, 40. “It’s not like Gainesville really needs an-other bar around here.”
Gator Shop owners said they look 
forward to their next chapter but will miss spending time in the store.
Every Friday and Saturday night, 
Ritch said, the family would take shifts sitting in the store while intoxi-cated students heading to and from the bars stumbled in to use the ATM.
“We called it ‘the show’,” she said. 
“We’ll miss watching the show.”

A police academy graduate was arrested on 
charges of domestic battery Sunday after he hit 
his girlfriend and sent her threatening text mes-
sages.
Carlston Watts, 20, got into a dispute with his 
girlfriend, Janine Merritt, 19, over their financial 
situation. The two live together and have a child, 
according to a Gainesville Police arrest report.
GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri said 
Merritt called Watts a “deadbeat dad” and locked 
Watts out of their apartment, adding that Watts beat down the door, pushed Merritt against a wall 
and spit on her.
Merritt fled to her mother’s apartment a few 
doors down. Watts followed 
her and hit Merritt on her head, 
leaving a large lump, accord-
ing to the report. Merritt spent the night at her mother’s apart-ment.
Throughout the night, Watts 
sent Merritt what she believed 
were threatening text mes-
sages, so she called the police the next morning, Valuri said.
Watts declined to comment, and Merritt did 
not return a call for one.  
Police arrested Watts at 10:45 a.m. He told the 
officer she had every right to arrest him.
Watts received a certificate of completion from 
the Santa Fe College Institute of Public Safety Law Enforcement Degree program in December 2011, according to SFC General Counsel Patti Locascio.
Upon reading Watts his Miranda Rights, the 
arresting officer said Watts recited the elements of domestic battery, which he learned while in school, according to the arrest report. Watts then told the officer, “You have probable cause to ar -
rest me.”

A homeless man known to friends as 
“Wine” died Saturday after he inadver -
tently steered his bicycle into traffic.
Henry Ray, 73, was pedaling south 
on Main Street at about 9 a.m. when he 
veered left, according to Gainesville Po-
lice. Gail L. Kelly, 42, was driving behind Ray when he cut her off. Unable to stop the car in time, Kelly hit him.
Ray suffered severe head trauma, and 
paramedics drove him to Shands at UF. About six hours later, he died. The crash was still under investigation Monday af-ternoon, though Kelly probably won’t be charged, GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Ange-lina Valuri said.
Winston Gibson, 65, used to live with 
Ray at The 400, a high-rise for the elderly 
on Northwest First Avenue that is owned 
by the Gainesville Housing Authority.
Most didn’t know him as Henry Ray , 
though. Those at The 400 called him Wine. He loved to drink and smoke cigars, Gib-son said.
Wine would talk to almost anybody about almost anything. He loved to lounge in The 400’s lobby or hold court at the nearby bus stop, telling anyone who 
would listen about the women he had 
been with, Gibson said.
“He would hang out, get a little bit 
tipsy and start talkin’ to everybody,” Gib-son said. 
Esaw Durant, 82, said he would worry 
when he watched Wine ride his bike.
“When you’re drinkin,’ now, don’t 
ride that bicycle,” Durant remembers 
telling his friend. “He was a grown man. 
He do what he wants, I guess. You’ll find people like that. He wasn’t no drunk, though.”

Residents recently resurrected a debate 
about whether Mayor Craig Lowe’s aide was 
hired under proper circumstances.
At a City Commission meeting March 1, 
Gainesville residents disagreed with the deci-
sion to hire Garrett Garner in 2010 and to give 
him a pay raise in 2011. They said the job was not advertised, and the position didn’t exist before Lowe took office.
Lowe countered, saying the temporary 
employee hiring process was fair and done ac-cording to policy.
“The mayor needs to hire someone he 
knows to be competent, trustworthy and dedi-
cated to the community,” Lowe said. “His po-
sition is rock-solid.”
Garner said the city’s human resources 
department contacted him shortly after Lowe was sworn in as mayor. Garner filled out an application about his qualifications, but there wasn’t an interview. He said he didn’t know if anyone else was competing for the job.He is paid $22.06 per hour.
Opponents say the job wasn’t advertised 
and that Garner was hand-picked after Lowe’s 
election.
Resident Juanita Miles Hamilton said this 
is an issue about breaking from policy , rather than an attack at Garner himself.
“All those policies are in place for a rea-
son, so all applicants have a chance,” she said. “And that’s just not what happened.”
Lowe said the criticism is simply post-elec-
tion flak since the criticizing residents were supporters of candidates he didn’t back in the recent city election.
“Their candidates lost. My candidates 
won,” he said. “And they are mad.”
Garner, 25, graduated from UF in 2009 with 
a degree in history , and he completed minors in environmental science and urban and re-
gional planning. He is engaged and owns a 
basset hound mix named Maya, after Maya Angelou.
Garner was Lowe’s campaign manager in 
2010 when Lowe ran for mayor.
Lowe said it’s a common practice to hire a mayor’s aide and that Garner has proven in-dispensable during his term.
Lowe said Tallahassee’s mayor has three 
aides, Miami Beach’s has two aides and the 
mayor of Chapel Hill, N.C., has one.
He said Garner has helped him deal with 
the Quran-burning controversy, sift through 
issues surrounding the Cabot-Koppers Su-
perfund site, boost South-west Second Avenue eco-nomically and double the amount of airlines flying out of the Gainesville Re-
gional Airport.
Garner started talks 
with different businesses to 
bring them to town, he said, including Totuit.
Lowe said Garner researches issues, goes 
to meetings on his behalf and helps to expand the city’s economy. Garner said he also helps the mayor by reviewing meeting agendas.
He said his background makes him a great 
fit with what Lowe wants to do.
Garner said his grandmother worked for the South Carolina Department of Social Ser -
vices and his grandfather was a police ser -
geant in Florence, S.C., setting an example of the importance of public service. 
Hearing about his mother’s job as a com-
puter software programmer around the din-ner table sparked his interest for technology , he said, which meshes well with Lowe’s vision of a high-tech economy in Gainesville.
Those who question the hiring process say 
they want the issue reassessed.
Miles Hamilton, along with three others, 
spoke at the March 1 meeting about how Gar -
ner was hired. 
“I am just concerned about the violation of 
city policy,” she said.
She said the worst part is that now that po-
sition can’t be taken by a Gainesville city em-ployee, and she said processes like this don’t 
promote upward mobility.
Garner said he deals with the criticism by 
putting his mind on his work.
“I have learned not to focus on the criti-
cism,” Garner said.

Ugandan jungle to infamy as arguably the most hated man on the face of the planet. And rightly so.
One 30-minute video produced by Invisible Children, 
the nonproﬁ  t organization spearheading the capture of Kony and his Lord’s Resistance Army, has launched a massively successful campaign to spread awareness about a man who kidnaps children and forces them to commit atrocities.
The infective clout of Facebook and Twitter has made 
the United Nations’ most wanted man an international su-perstar. Even the most apathetic are ready to update their personal info to “social activist.”
The natural ﬁ  rst impulse after watching the short but 
spectacularly moving ﬁ  lm is to donate to Invisible Chil-dren. But before you put your credit card number into cy-berspace, a little background check is necessary.
Speculation surrounds Invisible Children. Rumors 
have been swirling that the founders of Invisible Children have taken pictures with generals of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, a rival terrorist group that is working against the LRA but is still accused of raping and looting the people of Uganda. Just because they counteract the LRA doesn’t exactly qualify them as freedom ﬁ  ghters.
Invisible Children is also said to be a little shady with 
money. Since the organization is not-for-proﬁ  t, its ﬁ  -nances must be public. Last year, Invisible Children spent $8,676,614, yet only 32 percent went to direct services. The paperwork documents that the rest was spent on salaries, ﬁ  lm, travel and transport.I have no doubt that the orga-
nization has the best intentions of stopping Kony, but it seems as though Invisible Children has some ‘splanin’ to do. If it wants to turn the campaign from awareness to fundraising, the or-ganization needs to get it togeth-er and make itself crystal clear in order to gain and maintain trust.
Until the rumors and hearsay are squared away, the 
best weapon to use against Kony is what we’ve been us-ing all along: awareness.
We have recently witnessed the power of awareness 
and public frustration ﬁ  rsthand with the effective strike-out of SOPA and PIPA. Once again, we as constituents need to ﬂ  ood Congress with concern.
The letters campaign — as suggested by Invisible Chil-
dren — is the best bet. If Congress realizes how big of a deal this is, they’ll work America’s inﬂ  uence to put an end to Kony and his reign of terror. After all, the welfare of children should, in all cases, be second to none.
In the video, director Jason Russell said a phenomenon 
like the unrest in Uganda, would never happen here, in the land of the free.
He’s right. If a child were kidnapped and forced to 
kill his or her own parents here in the United States, we’d all hear, read and see it within a matter of a post, tweet or broadcast. Barbarity to that extent is a faraway tale to Americans, but it is a brutal reality to so many in Africa.
Watching a video, liking a status and changing a proﬁ  le 
picture to a Kony 2012 poster is the ﬁ  rst step to catching Kony, but it deﬁ  nitely isn’t enough. Contact your local politicians and let them know that as a human being, you won’t tolerate this dehumanization of children.

Gainesville Sun too 
sensitive about cartoon
On Monday , The Gainesville Sun chose not to run the 
day’s edition of Doonesbury , a popular comic strip by Garry Trudeau.
The biggest question we have is: What are you afraid of?The Sun published an editor’s note online with the headline 
“Why Doonesbury isn’t in The Sun this week.” The note ex-plained that the comic did not make it into its print edition “due to insensitive language.”
Did the comic strip include cuss words, dropping a few “s” 
and “f” bombs?
No, it didn’t.Did the comic strip use racial slurs or single out a particular 
group of people?
No, it didn’t do that, either.
So why did The Sun feel it was necessary to censor this 
strip?
The comic starts with a woman entering what looks like a 
hospital. She asks a medical assistant in a white lab coat if she is 
in the right place to get a sonogram.
The medical assistant asks the woman if this is her ﬁ  rst time 
terminating a pregnancy. The woman replies in the afﬁ  rmative and the medical assistant asks her to ﬁ  ll out a form and sit in “The Shaming Room.”
The woman asks what the medical assistant means by this 
remark, and the assistant responds, “A middle-aged, male state legislator will be with you in a moment.”
Recently , a few states have tried — and succeeded — to pass 
laws mandating that women seeking abortions must ﬁ  rst re-ceive an ultrasound. This week’s Doonesbury was clearly com-menting on this issue.
It plays off the argument that the government is getting be-
tween women and their health care decisions by literally putting 
a state legislator in the aforementioned situation.
But the Alligator is not concerned with the arguments made 
by the cartoon. Instead, we are concerned with why The Sun 
thought the cartoon was so offensive that it decided to remove it from its regular spot on the comics page.
The Sun, like the Alligator, is a private institution and has the 
ability to make editorial decisions about what does and does not run on its pages.
The First Amendment guarantees the freedom of publications 
to write and publish anything they want, as well as prohibit the publication of anything of which they do not approve.
But why censor this comic? What was so insensitive about 
it?
While newspapers have the editorial freedom to decide what 
goes on their pages, should it not strive to contribute to public discourse as much as possible by publishing competing argu-ments?
This Doonesbury cartoon made a very valid argument about 
this issue, and one that should be a part of the public discus-
sion.
Just because you have the right to self-censor does not mean 
you should.

Tiemeier’s apology does not inspire faith in Student 
Government
Former Senate President pro tempore Jason Tiemeier’s apol-
ogy, while well overdue, leaves much to be desired.
During the days leading up to the election, Tiemeier denied 
the accusation that he threw away newspapers containing a 
Students Party endorsement, claiming he was asleep at the 
time of the incident. Tiemeier mentioned Sen. Katie Waldman’s 
presence in his apology , identifying her to the Student Body as the previously “unidentified woman” accompanying him.
Waldman, ironically the vice chairman of the rules and 
ethics committee in the Senate, evidently did nothing to stop Tiemeier from disposing of the newspapers and neglected to mention her involvement in this scandal.
In his apology, Tiemeier calls for students to have faith in 
the integrity of UF Student Government, a call that we feel 
falls flat. He asks for the students to support the newly elected 
Senate president and president pro tempore, but after this inci-dent, how can anyone take him, or his party members, at their word?
How can any of them be trusted when we now know that 
high-ranking members of the Unite Party were there while he was throwing away newspapers and did nothing to expose the truth?
If Waldman knew the entire election cycle, did President-
elect Tj Villamil know the truth when he created a YouTube video saying the Alligator was falsifying stories?
Did Unite Campaign Manager Brock Hankins know the 
truth when he said that neither Tiemeier nor anyone in the Unite Party was involved in the newspaper disposal?It is impossible for students to tell where the lies stop and 
the truth begins. As long as these individuals continue to be in charge, students will need to keep a watchful eye on the Stu-dent Senate and the rest of Student Government.
The Students Party thanks Jason Tiemeier for apologizing, 
but we find it difficult to believe he acted independently.
We encourage all individuals involved to come clean. The 
Student Body deserves nothing less than an honest and trans-parent Student Government.

BURGERevolution next step in campaign for a humane 
and sustainable campus
Something silent happened before we left for Spring Break. 
You might even call it the most silent revolution this orange-
and-blue-bathed city has ever seen.
Before we left to part ways for a week, Gators transformed 
campus with a BURGERevolution.
And leading the upheaval wasn’t who you think it might 
be.
The BURGERevolution reinvented Gator Corner Dining 
Center for one Monday in late February with Gators waiting in line a dozen deep for veggie burgers served up four differ -
ent ways, including in a spicy mango stir fry and in green chili tacos — and it didn’t have a vegetarian at the helm, ready to charge.The BURGERevolution, a Gator Dining Services food ex-
travaganza planned as part of UF’s ongoing and evolving com-mitment to Meatless Mondays, didn’t have me as the Burger -
meister either. Instead, it was you. It was The Gator Nation. And it was Gator Dining Services that lead the way.
And in a way, this revolution of sorts went by almost unno-
ticed and silent because it wasn’t a revolution at all. This latest reinvention of how we as Gators think of food was merely the most recent tangible product of our remarkable work to make UF a more sustainable, healthier and more ethical university.
This revolution was led by more than 5,000 of you who 
carried your pens like swords to sign a petition demanding a Meatless Monday and a healthier array of vegetarian options at your university. It was led by People for the Ethical Treat-ment of Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, GatorWell, UF’s Office of Sustainability, Gators for a Sustain-able Campus and the EarthDay Network, which all publicly supported and endorsed our push for dining centers that are free of cruelty and easier on the environment. And it was led 
by the fine folks at Gator Dining Services who, believe me, are 
listening to all of your cries.
In one of the nation’s largest land-grant universities, we 
brought tofu to town.
If this latest triumph in our push for a humane and sustain-
able campus, this latest BURGERevolution, has taught us all one thing, it should be this, which Maya Angelo said best.
You think you may not be heard. Speak anyway.

Last week in the White House, President 
Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu reaffirmed 
their mutual commitment to preventing Iran 
from acquiring nuclear weapons. For the first 
time, President Obama stated that American 
policy toward Iran is not “containment” but 
aims instead to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran 
altogether.
The leaders disagreed, however, on what 
line Iran would have to cross before the al-
lies would resort to military force. As long as 
this gap in America and Israel’s mobilization schedules exists, Israel should feel reassured 
of America’s support for its right to defend 
itself.
America reserves the right to indepen-
dently determine the terms of its military en-gagements. We should respect Israel’s right 
to the same.
To be certain, the Iranian regime is hurting 
from international sanctions. Iran’s economy is collapsing. Since last year, Iran’s currency, 
the rial, has lost 71 percent of its value against the American dollar.By midsummer, the European Union will 
no longer import Iranian oil as China, Japan 
and South Korea have also taken steps to 
reduce Iranian oil imports. America has im-posed serious sanctions on Iran’s financial 
institutions and central bank.
President Obama and Prime Minister Ne-
tanyahu are wise in giving sanctions more 
time to work. Iran’s reaction thus far, how-ever, raises reasonable doubts about whether its leaders can be trusted to negotiate as “ra-
tional actors.”
In recent months, Iran has continued to 
mislead the world in the following ways: It has denied International Atomic Energy 
Agency inspectors access to its nuclear facili-ties, lied about its enrichment of uranium for 
“medical research,” plotted to assassinate 
Saudi ambassador to the United States Adel 
Al-Jubeir in a cafe in Washington D.C., and 
threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz, choking off 20 percent of the world’s oil sup-
ply.
This behavior follows a history of Iranian 
actions that cannot be explained by reason-able policy objec-
tives. In the 1980s, 
for example, Iran 
escalated a border skirmish with Iraq 
into one of the most brutal wars since World War II.
The regime sponsors terrorist organiza-
tions through its proxies like Hamas and Hez-bollah and was notably involved in the 1992 terrorist attack on Israel’s embassy in Buenos 
Aires, the 1983 terrorist attack on 241 Ameri-
can servicemen in Lebanon and the 1996 kill-ing of 19 servicemen in the Khobar Towers in 
Saudi Arabia, among many others.
The brutal crackdown on its own citizens 
during the 2009 presidential elections, its shutting down of oppositional newspapers 
and access to social media, as well as vehe-
ment unapologetic denial of the Holocaust 
and statements that Israel should be “wiped off the map,” show Iran’s irrationality is real.
The amount of time Iran needs to ac-
quire a nuclear weapon is a question of fact over which allies can reasonably differ. The threat posed to the international commu-nity is grave as a nuclear-armed Iran would 
embolden Iran’s terrorist agents, instigate a 
regional nuclear arms race and shift the bal-ance of power in Iran’s direction and allow 
the country to blackmail the world.
The threat posed to Israel is real as Israel 
would be condemned to a permanent state of 
emergency and subject to annihilation by an Iranian strike. 
Though Israel cannot bind America to 
military engagement, America should honor Israel’s right to unilaterally defend itself in multiple concrete ways.
This recognition entails rigorous Ameri-
can support at the U.N. Security Council and logistical support for the Israel Defense 
Force. It means America will not condition 
aid to Israel on Israeli adherence to the U.S. 
mobilization schedule.
American and Israeli policy are one and 
the same. The U.S.-Israeli alliance should not come apart over a question of timing.

Dr. Pedro Jose Greer will 
speak about the plight of 
the underprivileged as seen 
through the eyes of a medi-
cal doctor at 6 p.m. in Pugh Hall.
The presentation, titled 
“Rx for Hope: Medical Care for the Homeless,” is free and open to the public.
Greer, a UF alumnus, 
has worked for two White 
House administrations, 
and earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
He is now the assistant 
dean of academic affairs at the Florida Interna-tional University’s Herbert Wertheim College of Medi-cine.
Greer has made it a focus 
in his career to be socially responsible, especially to 
those who are poor or home-
less.
“I believe professionals 
need to take on more re-
sponsibil-
ity,” Greer 
said. “As a doctor, 
I see how 
poverty re-ally affects 
people.”
After graduating from 
medical school, Greer said he originally wanted to travel to places such as South Asia and Africa to help the im-
poverished. However, after an encounter with a home-
less man here in the United States, he realized the prob-lem was closer to home.
His hope, he said, is 
that one day the rich and the poor will be treated the same when it comes to med-ical care.
Shelby Taylor, the digital 
and communications direc-tor at the Bob Graham Cen-ter for Public Service, said 
the center is hosting Greer 
because he is an example of an alumnus who has used his talents to improve lives in his community.
“I hope I get people to 
think and challenge their assumptions,” Greer said. “I also hope to get a few 
laughs.”
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — Oh, you pretty things. 
Just look at the mama giraffe nuzzling a baby 
giraffe, that lovely idea for an indoor plant-er made of mason jars and those perfectly cooked bacon strips cooling on a plate. This 
is what people are circulating on Pinterest, 
the latest website-of-the-moment for sharing things you love.
Clean and simple to use, Pinterest attracts 
people who need to organize the chaos of In-ternet-age information overload. It serves as an online scrapbook of images they find on the Web, a place to post fashion inspirations, decorating aspirations and more. It’s a digital dream collage, a recipe box and a corkboard full of magazine clippings all at once.
The site’s popularity has exploded in 
recent months, making it one of the fastest-growing websites in history. Its ascent to 10 million monthly visitors happened faster than Facebook, Twitter or any other site tracked by comScore.
What makes Pinterest’s surge unusual is 
that it’s driven not by the usual geek crowd of young men from New York and San Fran-
cisco, but by women, many of whom live in 
the Midwest and the central U.S.
Pinterest’s co-founder Ben Silbermann 
will speak this week at the South by South-west Interactive festival in Austin, Texas. As part of a Q&A session Tuesday, he’ll explain Pinterest’s rapid growth outside of Silicon 
Valley and discuss the company’s long-term 
goals. The cascade of images shared on any given 
day ranges from quirky nail art to a shirtless Ryan Gosling to ephemeral nature scenes. Clicking on an image can take you to a recipe or a blog post, or at times, an empty page.
Unlike other startups, whose early users 
tend to be men under 35, Internet tracking firm comScore estimates that 68 percent of Pinterest users are women, and these women drive 85 percent of the traffic on the site. In other words, not only are there more women on Pinterest but they are much more active than men.
Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altim-
eter Group, believes part of the reason that Pinterest’s early adopters are less geeky than usual is that there is, literally, “nothing to adopt.” There’s nothing to download and no complex controls to master. You simply log in and pin.
Pinterest’s creators registered Pinterest.
com in 2009, but it didn’t take off until last summer. ComScore says the site had 17.8 million U.S. visitors last month, up about 50 percent from 11.7 million in January. 
In another sign it’s made a mark, Pinterest 
has already spawned parody. The gender dis-crepancy is probably why someone thought to create Manteresting.com, a site that looks just like Pinterest — but for dudes.
Instead of pinning images, you nail them. 
Instead of puppy photos and cupcakes, there 
are Star Wars references, beer and sneakers. 
Instead of willowy dresses and floppy hats, the women of Manteresting wear as little as possible.8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 2012

Lions, tigers and elephants are coming to town this week-
end.
The Gainesville Community Fest, a new community festi-
val, will be open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday at the Alachua 
County Fairgrounds.
Advance tickets, available at gainesvillecommunityfest.
com, are $5 for students and those ages 13 and older. The cost is $3 for children 5 to 12. Tickets at the gate will be $6 for stu-dents, $7.50 for ages 13 and older and $5.50 for children 5 to 12. Children under 5 years old get in for free, and students should 
bring a student ID.
The fair will have elephant rides from All About Elephants 
and lions and tigers from Single Vision, a Melrose endangered 
species educational company.
“It’s a way to celebrate the community and the people that 
are a part of it,” said Richard Dreher, president of Gainesville Activities, the organization hosting the fair.
There will also be a rock-climbing wall, an archery range, 
laser tag and an inflatable jousting arena.
A portion of Gainesville Community Fest proceeds will be 
donated to Kids Kicking Cancer.
The event showcases about 100 of Gainesville’s businesses, 
clubs and nonprofit organizations in order to encourage resi-dents to spend their money at locally owned stores, said Jordyn Reese, the festival director.
“Gainesville is such a thriving bubble, and we ourselves 
could easily self-sustain our city ,” Reese said. “Having an event that really shows the different aspects of our city will re-ally inspire people to buy local and play local.”Community festival to encourage attendees to spend locally

A Gainesville couple lost almost 
$12,000 worth of jewelry Sunday 
morning when they were robbed at 
gunpoint.
Kemar Johnson, 29, and Hanna 
Davis, 26, were standing in front of 
the Palms Condominiums at 230 SW 
Second Ave. at about 1:30 a.m. when 
a pair of strangers approached them, according to a Gainesville Police re-port. 
The suspects remained at large as 
of Monday afternoon, police said.
One of the suspects, wearing a red 
T-shirt, cocked his pistol sideways and pointed it at Johnson. The other suspect yanked John-
son’s $1,200 white gold and diamond necklace off. 
Johnson then gave up his $3,000 
diamond watch, according to GPD.
The suspects also demanded Da-
vis’ $7,500 engagement ring. 
When Davis refused, the suspect 
in the red T-shirt slapped her in the face and forced the ring off her fin-
ger, according to the report.
Both suspects then ran north.
The suspect in the red T-shirt is 
about 5 feet 6 inches with gold teeth and dreadlocks, according to police.
Anyone with information is urged to 
call GPD at 352-393-7500.

Coach Amanda Butler’s women’s basketball team received Monday its second bid to the NCAA Tourna -
ment in her five years as coach. Florida is a No. 9 seed and plays No. 8 seed Ohio State on Sunday.
� UF PLAYS SUNDAY 
AGAINST OHIO STATE AT 12:15 P.M. ON ESPN2. 
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Earning a berth in the NCAA 
Tournament played out like much 
of the Gators’ season — it was 
close.
Florida (19-12), a No. 9 seed, 
was one of the last four teams 
added into The Big Dance along 
with Texas, Michigan and Kan-
sas State, according to NCAA women’s committee chairman Greg Christopher. They will play in the Des Moines region against 
eighth-seeded Ohio State (25-6) in 
Bowling Green, Ohio, on Sunday at 12:15 p.m. on ESPN2.
The bid is the Gators’ first since 
2009 and the second in five years under coach Amanda Butler.
“I don’t care — last four in, first 
four in,” redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones said. “We’re in and 
that’s all that matters.”
Eight Southeastern Conference  
teams made the NCAA Tourna-
ment for just the  third time ever, and this year marks the first time it’s happened since 2002. 
As one of the final teams to 
make the cut, UF clinching a bid to the NCAA Tournament was not as assured as the Gators believed 
down the stretch. 
Following a 79-45 win against 
Mississippi State on Feb. 23, But-
ler said that there was “no ques-tion” that UF deserved an at-large bid.
After a road loss to Tennessee 
and a quarterfinal exit from the 
SEC Tournament against Ken-
tucky on March 2, assistant coach Brenda Mock Kirkpatrick said she would be “shocked” if Florida did 
not receive an at-large bid. 
Butler said much of the same 
Sunday.
“I think we’re in; I just can’t 
imagine that we’re not,” Butler said. “The total body of work, in 
particular what we did in confer -
ence play, I think is significant.”
The Gators are the lowest-
seeded SEC team in the NCAA 
Tournament thanks to an eighth-
place finish in league play, but the closeness of their games worked in their favor.
In nine losses to conference foes 
this season, UF lost by an average of just 5.6 points per game.
Also helping matters was Flor -
ida’s two-game sweep of fifth-
seeded LSU and a late-season up-
set of No. 4 seed Georgia.
“If you’re a casual basketball 
fan and you see 19-12, you might not think, ‘Oh, they deserve to be 
in,’” Jones said Sunday. “But if 
you look at what we’ve done and how we’ve played, then I feel like Gators sneak into NCAA Tournament for first time since 2009

Daniel Gibson knew he would have a big-
ger role this year. It wouldn’t be a hard feat to 
accomplish. 
As a freshman, Gibson took the mound just 
14 times for a total of 10.1 innings. He tried to alter his throwing motion, and the result 
was an ERA of 13.06 and the helplessness that 
comes with watching opposing hitters bat .442. 
Looking for an answer, Gibson swapped 
back to his high school delivery for his sopho-
more season and altered how he pitches from 
the stretch after learning in the Cape Cod 
League that he was tipping off his pitches. 
“I feel a lot better, a lot more comfortable,” 
the left-hander said. “I get more tempo and can stay back a lot better.” 
As No. 1 Florida (15-1) enters what is ex-
pected to be a bullpen duel with No. 7 Florida 
State (14-1) tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium, Gibson is no longer a weakness. He is now one 
of the numerous strengths 
in a bullpen that is putting up big-time numbers. 
Gibson has already got-
ten the ball seven times, tied with junior Austin Maddox and senior Greg Larson for the most appearances on the staff. In eight innings of work, he holds a perfect 
0.00 ERA and has given up just one hit. On Sunday, he picked up his first win since Gibson, bullpen key against ‘Noles

Like most other NCAA Tournament 
teams at the moment, the Gators are go-
ing into their preparation for this week’s 
opening-round game largely blind.
Less than a day after discovering the 
identity of their first opponent, Florida’s 
players were only able to repeat vague 
details they have heard throughout the season concerning Virginia’s stingy de-
fense and plodding offense. 
Senior guard Erving Walker said he caught a couple UVA games on TV ear -
lier this year, though he “never watched 
closely.”
Before venturing into his first taste 
of March Madness, Brad Beal said he 
“knows nothing” about the Cavaliers, 
a team the Gators have 
only played once in 
school history — a six-point loss in 1992.
Both might want to start by learning 
one name: Mike Scott.Stopping Scott first hurdle

UF Bask etball“We’re in  and that’s all 
that matters.”
Jordan Jones
UF senior guard
Quotable
“I personally never, since I’ve been in college, sat there and filled 
out a bracket. Maybe when we went to the NIT I did.” 
Erving Walker, UF point guard   
(on participating in NCAA Tournament bracket challenges)He’s the only Virginia player UF 
coach Billy Donovan mentioned in 
his Monday morning press confer -
ence and for good reason. 
In his fifth season with the Cav-
aliers, Scott — the Atlantic Coast Conference’s runner-up for Player 
of the Year — has grown into one 
of the nation’s most versatile scorers 
down low.
“He clearly would be one of 
the better players in the SEC and 
clearly is one of the best players in 
the ACC,” Donovan said. “He is a 
consummate scorer, because he can do it on the offensive glass, he can 
do it from the post, he can do it from 
stepping away from the basket and 
shooting it and also he can do it off 
the dribble. So, he is really a hand-
ful.”
Scott, a 6-foot-8, 237-pound for -
ward, scores 18.1 points per game 
and has led Virginia in points or rebounds in 29 of the team’s 31 games.  
In conference play alone, he 
accounted for 32.7 percent of the 
Cavaliers’ total points and was the 
only UVA player to average double-
figures.
Donovan compared Scott to Mis-
sissippi State freshman Arnett Moul-trie, who notched a double-double 
against Florida in late January.
“He’s a different kind of player 
but kind of a similar impact as 
Moultrie,” Donovan said. “He’s all over the place. And I think that can 
be very similar to Scott because he’s kind of all over the place. They can 
move him around because he can 
create his own shot for himself in a 
lot of ways.”
As a team, the Cavaliers aver -
age just 63.1 points per game — the third-lowest in the ACC this season 
— making Scott’s ability to score 
even more critical for Virginia.
While the Gators have a clear-cut offensive threat to focus on going 
forward, the same cannot be said for 
the Cavaliers. UF has had five differ -
ent leading scorers in its last seven games and, aside from Beal, has 
struggled to get consistent scoring 
from its guards down the stretch.
Kenny Boynton, the Gators’ lead-
ing scorer at 16.3 points per game, has been held to single-digits in two 
of his last three games, including a 
season-low two points Saturday in 
New Orleans against Kentucky . 
Walker’s offensive numbers 
have also slipped with three straight games under his average of 12.1 points, though the point guard has 
kept a positive assist-to-turnover ra-
tio in each outing. 
“We definitely want to play bet-
ter, but I don’t think it is all on us,” Walker said. “We’re a team, and no 
one or two players can just change 
everything.”

THE RALLY
GREG: Despite what the recent win-loss 
record suggests, Florida is entering the NCAA Tournament on a high note. 
To simply say that the Gators have lost six 
of their last 10 games vastly understates all 
that’s happened during the past five weeks. 
UF suffered its worst loss of the season Feb. 
7 at Kentucky, played its best game of the year 
Feb. 18 against Arkansas, lost Will Yeguete for 
the season Feb. 21 and has been working to es-
tablish continuity since. 
Those efforts culminated in Saturday’s 74-
71 loss to Kentucky , a game in which UF scored 
1.169 points per possession. It was the best of-
fensive performance anyone has had against 
UK this year, according to KenPom.com, and helped UF stand toe-to-toe with No. 1. 
Billy Donovan said his team has been play-
ing well and that the Gators have gotten com-fortable working without Yeguete, so why shouldn’t expectations follow suit? 
This was a top-10 group in the preseason 
and is playing perhaps its best basketball of 
the year. Anything short of the Final Four 
should be a disappointment.
MATT: Sure, Florida is riding high after 
nearly dethroning college basketball royalty, 
but that doesn’t mean that people should ex-
pect these Gators to reach just the program’s fifth Final Four in its history . 
The injury to Florida’s first and best re-
serve was big, but not as much as some have made it out to be. When Yeguete went down, the team most definitely lost a key piece, but it also gained a crutch — and that’s not a pun on the French-man’s foot injury . Most are actually using the injury 
to downplay the 
downward spiral 
of the season. 
The truth is 
this team was 
never as good on 
the court as it was on paper back in November, 
and that’s not going to change before Friday. 
Patric Young isn’t going to start magically 
coming up with rebounds he has been missing 
all season. Erving Walker isn’t going to stop 
making silly decisions in crucial moments. Erik Murphy isn’t putting on 20 pounds of muscle and a lion’s share of courage.
This team is what it is — a free-wheeling, 
deep-shooting, no-defense-playing enigma that is fun to watch but doesn’t have the back-bone to go all the way.
GREG: Listen, I’m as pessimistic about 
Florida’s Final Four chances as anybody . 
Teams that shoot as many threes as UF 
does haven’t usually made deep runs, and I 
don’t think this year will be any different. But 
the rest of the college basketball world — fans 
and analysts alike — seem to be willing to look past that, and those people should at the very least expect the Elite Eight.
Brad Beal, Kenny Boynton and Murphy 
have all exceeded preseason expectations, with Young and Walker taking a step up from 2010-11 as well. And they have a coach who knows what it takes to win it all.
With that talent 
playing near its best 
at the perfect time, 
why would you ex-
pect less than you did before the year?
MATT: To ex-
pect that level of success from this team is foolhardy . 
This year’s Gators are a reincarnation of 
sorts of the 2007-08 team, which started 18-3 
before losing seven of its last 10 games and 
ending up getting stood up for The Big Dance, and the only real difference is that this year’s team actually made the tournament. 
Both teams had unquestionable talent — 
Marreese Speights and Chandler Parsons are both playing in the NBA, like Young and Beal will, and Nick Calathes and Kenny Boynton 
are very similar players. But both teams had 
severe questions about maturity , questions 
about toughness and questions about whether they were capable of beating quality oppo-nents. 
Donovan even made this comparison a 
couple of weeks ago, saying this team needed to make a turnaround to have a chance at ful-filling the expectations we’re dedicating this edition of The Rally to discussing. Instead, in-
side the locker room after a game at the SEC 
Tournament last week, Young was still talking about the team trying to grow up. GREG: If Saturday’s performance in front 
of 20,000 Kentucky fans didn’t show you toughness and maturity, I don’t know what will. 
Despite having to shuffle roles and line-
ups to compensate for Yeguete’s absence, the Gators have figured it out and are back in top form. That’s the type of resiliency the 2007-08 team was missing.
The only time a loss should be expected 
now is when the opponent is legitimately more talented than Florida. For a team with two first-round draft picks and an experienced backcourt, that shouldn’t be any time soon.
MATT: I see what you did there, but again, 
you’re just wrong. 
Like one astute Kentucky writer point-
ed out to Young following Saturday’s loss, Florida didn’t actually win the game. Why should I be excited about a loss? Why should the fans believe the Gators will finally win a 
game against a good team in the tournament 
when they haven’t proven capable of that all 
season?
Just like the 2007-08 team, which lost at the 
end of the regular season to that year’s SEC 
powerhouse and No. 2 seed Tennessee (31-5, 
No. 5 final ranking) by the same three-point 
margin, this year’s team will be remembered more for what could have been than what it accomplished when it mattered most.

Stewart: This year’s 
team better than ‘09
we should be in there.” 
Going into this weekend, only senior center Azania 
Stewart and redshirt senior forward Ndidi Madu have 
NCAA Tournament experience. Stewart and Madu played 
for Florida when it lost to No. 1 seed and eventual national champion Connecticut in the second round in 2009.
While the 2008-09 team stands as the 
best of Butler’s tenure based on results, Stewart believes that this year’s squad is better.
“We actually have a chance to go 
deeper than we did my freshman year,” 
Stewart said. “We had a great team my 
freshman year, but I don’t think our chemistry, our fight and our overall per -
formance [was] as good.”
With five seniors on the roster, Jones likes the Gators’ 
chances of making a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
“That’s the biggest stage in basketball,” Jones said. “Ev-
eryone’s going to be watching it and you have a chance to show how hard you’ve worked all season and how you 
want go out and make a name for yourself.”

February of last year when he 
worked 2.1 hitless innings with four strikeouts in a 3-2 victory against Florida Gulf Coast. 
“That’s probably the best he’s 
thrown since he’s been a Gator,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said after the game. “Awfully proud of him.”
Gibson and the rest of the bull-
pen have given O’Sullivan plenty of reasons to be happy as of late. During the Gators’ current 13-game winning streak, relief pitch-ers have combined to throw 52.1 innings with just six earned runs, a 1.03 ERA and 63 strikeouts com-pared to 11 walks. They have al-lowed just five extra-base hits dur -
ing that span and have not given up a run in the eighth or ninth in-ning all season. 
The strength in the pen will al-
most certainly come in handy dur -
ing tonight’s rivalry showdown. 
In the four meetings between 
Florida and Florida State last sea-
son, each team used a total of 22 
pitchers. The Gators only had a 
pitcher last longer than 3.2 in-
nings once, and only two Seminole pitchers passed that mark. In UF’s 
only win in the 2011 series — a 
10-inning affair on March 15 — the 
teams combined to use 15 pitchers, 
six of which failed to register a full inning of work. 
With freshman Bobby Poyner 
getting only his second career start 
against a team that is averaging 
eight runs per game, Gibson and 
friends will be on call. 
“We have a lot of strong guys 
up front,” Gibson said. “Sully said 
from the beginning that I’m going 
to have a big role this year for us to be successful. I like it. I’m ready 
for it.”
As usual, the Seminoles will 
have answers of their own. Dur -
ing the same 13-game span, FSU’s bullpen has allowed just 15 earned runs and struck out 51. 
Whether or not that is enough to match a line of pitchers that also happens to include Maddox’s 14.1 scoreless innings, 21 strikeouts and five saves (already the same total as last year’s team high) will be de-cided tonight. Neither bullpen has given up a lead all season. 
Let the pitching changes begin.16, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, MARCH 13, 2012

Undefeated in four matches 
of Southeastern Conference 
play, UF’s second-ranked women’s tennis team could say that its hot start is due to a 
team-wide effort.  
To find out the real key, 
however, look no further than 
the top two singles spots.
Allie Will and Lauren Em-
bree have been Florida’s best players this season. The ju-niors are ranked No. 1 and No. 23 in the country, respectively. 
What adds another dimension 
to the team, though, is the abil-ity of these two players to be interchangeable at the top two spots in the lineup. 
“They’re just invaluable for 
us, and the fact that they buy into it and support each other and the team is all you need to 
know about their character,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
In Monday’s 7-0 win over 
Kentucky (8-7, 0-4 SEC), Em-bree played at the top singles spot, beating UK’s Jackie Stiles 6-2, 6-0. Will played on court two, dispatching Khristina Bla-jevitch 6-0, 6-1. It was the fifth 
time this season Embree has 
taken the top spot and Will’s sixth time playing the two.
For Embree and Will, their 
spot on the court has had no bearing on their quality of play. Will is 5-1 at the top spot and 5-0 at two, while Embree is 5-0 and 4-2 at those respec-
tive spots. While each player’s style differs, Thornqvist said 
that much of the reason they are interchangeable is because they are intrinsically alike.
“They have a different style, 
but both are fundamentally 
very similar in that they’re 
very athletic, tough and play 
big points really well,” he said. 
“The rest of the team, even though we don’t say it, feeds off those two.”
Embree and Will each said 
switching their spot works well for the team. The Gators (10-1, 4-0 SEC) essentially have two top players who can be shuffled around depending on matchups, something few other teams possess.
“It’s really nice for both of 
us because we’re both playing really 
well, and it’s nice to have that balance,” Embree said. 
Will said 
that the s w i t c h i n g 
doesn’t affect their play at all. Because of the nature of the 
Gators’ schedule, the two will 
be facing challenging oppo-
nents regardless of their place-
ment on the court.
“We’re both playing really 
well, and we can just switch 
up and down,” Will said. “Ev-ery team we play is very good at one and two, so it doesn’t make a big difference. We’re both just happy to be play-ing.”Embree, Will lead at
