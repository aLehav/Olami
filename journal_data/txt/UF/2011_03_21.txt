TAMPA — Wearing a sign around his 
neck that read, “Honk if I need an educa-
tion,” 15-year-old James Mond III stood for nearly four hours on a Tampa street corner.
Fed up with his bad grades, his mother 
sent him there hoping to teach him a lesson about the importance of an education.
Ronda Holder never finished high 
school and doesn’t want the same for her son.
So she sent him out Wednesday with a sign telling the world about his 1.22 GPA.
His middle school has since enrolled 
him in after-school tutoring.
The Department of Children and Fami-
lies is investigating whether the incident might be a form of maltreatment.
Holder says she doesn’t care about the 
critics. She wants her son to have an educa-tion.
Plenty of people honked.

The scene at Kanapaha Park 
had all the symptoms of a typical 
Sunday afternoon. 
Children played in the fields 
as families munched on their pic-
nic lunches and flew kites, taking in the warm, breezy day. 
But on one large field, there 
was something different. 
A crowd of people swarmed 
around a group of college stu-
dents who ran around with pre-
tend broomsticks between their legs, trying to throw a volley-ball through a trio of makeshift hoops.
The first Quidditch Swamp 
Cup was held this weekend, fea-turing six Quidditch teams from the around the state. 
Hosted by the UF Quidditch team, the event was the first re-
gional cup in the history of the 
International Quidditch Asso-ciation, which was based on the sport made famous by J.K Rowl-ing’s Harry Potter novels.Nick Murado, the president of 
the UF Quidditch club, said the team played very well over the weekend but was plagued by a couple unfortunate events that prevented it from advancing to the finals.
“Despite the fact that we 
didn’t make it to the finals,” Mu-rado said, “I still think we’re the best team out here.”
UF won most of its prelimi-nary round games, advancing to the playoffs to compete with teams from Ringling College of Art and Design, the University of Miami and the University of 
South Florida.
The Gators team went 1-2 in 
the first round of the playoffs, 
failing advance to the final series, which saw Miami beat Ringling 
for the Swamp Cup title.
Murado said the tournament 
was run very efficiently, espe-
cially considering it was its first 
year. 
About 50 people watched the 
best-of-three final series on Sun-
day.
“There were quite a few snags, 
but we managed to recover very 
quickly,” Murado said. “On the 
whole, everyone seems to be pretty happy with how things turned out.”
Despite the UF team’s disap-
pointing showing, Hannah Pohl-mann, a co-director of the Swamp Cup and a Beater for the UF team, said the group was looking for -
ward to the future.
“I’m happy with where we’re 
at, and we had a wonderful tour -
nament,” Pohlmann said. “For the first regional cup ever, it all went really well. Next year we 
want to make things way bigger 
for the Swamp Cup.”

UF QUIDDITCHUF can’t catch snitch, loses Swamp Cup
By MORGAN WATKINS

As the sun set over the Plaza of the 
Americas on Saturday night, three wom-
en with dirt-smudged faces, torn clothes and leaves in their tangled hair gathered around a tire.  
“Double, double toil and trouble; fire 
burn, and cauldron bubble,” they said as smoke bubbled over the black rubber.
A few minutes later, the three women backed away from the cauldron to make room for Macbeth. 
Bright white lights flashed behind Mac-
beth as a man crept forward like a zombie. It was Banquo, the man whose death Mac-beth himself had ordered. His shirt and neck were stained with his own blood. 
This was one of the darkest scenes in 
Shakespeare’s play “Macbeth,” which UF students performed for audiences seated on blankets and foldout chairs on the Pla-
za of the Americas over the weekend.The students were members of Shake-
speare in the Park, a UF club that reenacts the noted playwright’s work with a per -
sonal twist. Their performance of “Mac-
beth” called for the use of 
leather jackets, hubcaps, ham-mers, baseball bats and a fake 
severed head.
The club, which includes students from 
a variety of majors, performs one Shake-
spearean play each year. While in the past 
they have done comedies, such as “Much Ado About Nothing,” the students chose 
the darker “Macbeth” to challenge them-selves, said Noah Camenker, the club’s 
secretary. 
“We want to be a complete Shakespeare 
organization,” said Camenker, who acts 
as one of Macbeth’s handpicked hit men in the performance. “We want to branch 
out.”
The play revolves around a Scottish 
general, Macbeth, who claws his way to 
the throne through murder and deceit 
with the help of his wife. After killing the 
King of Scotland, Duncan, Macbeth goes Shakespeare troupe puts on spring performance

A pinecone-finding contest pulled Loy-
al Frisbie-Knudsen back to Gainesville.
He said the contest, run by Satchel’s 
Pizza, illustrates the relaxed atmosphere 
that makes Gainesville an enjoyable 
place to live. He said residents don’t rush 
through life; they take time to enjoy it.
“It was UF that brought me here and 
Gainesville that persuaded me to stay,” Frisbie-Knudsen, 34, said.
He is one of tens of thousands of resi-
dents who settled in Alachua County in the past 10 years.
The 2010 census results show that the county grew by 29,381 people since 2000, 
putting the latest population count at 
247,336.
“There’s advantages to having growth,” 
county manager Ran-dall Reid said. “We’re known as a community 
of a very high quality of life.”
While that growth 
is good, Reid said, it comes at a cost. More people means more services to provide. He 
said the county government will take the population increase into consideration when planning next year’s budget.Reid said that UF’s growth has added 
to the county’s quality of life.
“Part of the reason people enjoy the 
university community , even for the retired community, is they provide the hope and 
the security that life goes on,” he said.
UF grew by 4,009 students from 2000 
to 2010, putting last year’s enrollment at 
50,116 students, according to the Office of the University Registrar.
Several minority populations in the 
county, including Asian, Hispanic and Pacific Islander, more than doubled in the last decade, and the rest grew more than 
10 percent.
“We are culturally more diverse, not 
only racially but culturally,” Reid said.Census results show county’s growthn UF PRESIDENT BERNIE MACHEN WAS ON HAND.

After 10 years and tons of free midnight breakfasts, Gator -
Nights is still going strong. 
Florida’s weekly late-night program celebrated its 10-year an-
niversary Friday in the Reitz Union with many of its usual festivi-
ties, plus a little added flair. 
This week’s installment featured funnel cakes, candy apples 
and four birthday cakes. There were also carnival games, balloon animals, a screening of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” and guest appearances from Albert, Alberta and UF President Bernie Machen. 
“This program is one of the really positive things that’s been 
done and shows what the university is and what it can be all about,” Machen said. He emphasized the program’s ability to provide students a 
fun, unifying experience without the use of alcohol. 
In the wake of recent tragedies and with the majority of UF 
students being under 21, Machen suggests GatorNights to them. 
“To them I offer GatorNights as a wonderful example of how 
you can have a wonderful time with your peers and friends with-out an alcohol component to that experience,” Machen said. 
A pair of GatorNights alums, Jamal Sowell and Britney Swink, 
followed Machen at the podium and echoed his sentiments. 
Swink said her time working with the program 
helped her develop relationships with hundreds of “regulars,” people she became close with despite seeing them only on a weekly basis. 
Sowell said he never missed a Friday at GatorNights in his 
four years at UF, saying he wasn’t a big fan of clubs, drinking and the whole downtown scene. 
“I’ve seen the world, but, regardless of what I did, I always 
remembered GatorNights,” Sowell said. “GatorNights does have a place in my heart.”GatorNights celebrates 10 years

Three witches cower in front of the character Hecate during Shakespeare in the Park’s production of “Mac-
beth” on the Plaza of the Americas on Saturday. From left to right: senior JamieLynn Bucci, sophomore Alex Gonzalez, freshman Ashlyn Rothenberg and sophomore Alex Tammaro. 
The group performed on 
the Plaza of the Americas
on a warpath, eliminating all who get in his way until he himself 
is beheaded.
About 100 people attended Saturday night’s performance, 
which Bethany Koch, the club’s president, described as its best  yet. 
Casting for “Macbeth” took place  in the middle of the fall se-
mester, she said. The students practiced twice a week for the re-
mainder of the term. In the spring, they practiced three times a 
week to prepare. 
Since its formation in 2006, Shakespeare in the Park has grown 
every year, Camenker said.
“Every year we get a little bigger, a little better organized,” he 
said. “I want to come back in 10 years and see a Shakespeare in the Park show.”
Pamela Cayemitte, a UF senior who attended the play, said it 
picked up the pace in the second half. She was impressed with the 
students’ commitment to the play despite other responsibilities 
they had. 
After killing the men at his wife’s insistence, Macbeth, played 
by UF sophomore Andrew Habibzadegan, stood before the crowd holding a handful of  “bloody” butter knives.
Turning to the audience, he raised his hands toward the sky. 
“But wherefore could I not pronounce ‘Amen’?” he yelled. “I had most need of blessing, and ‘Amen’ stuck in my throat!”SHAKESPEARE , from page 1n 200 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE ACT

UF junior Courtney Read said almost all 
she can recall from her hypnosis was riding a 
motorcycle in a sandy, cactus-filled desert in Arizona.
Hypnotist Rich Alexander put Read into a 
deep sleep on stage in front of about 200 stu-dents Saturday . Read said she couldn’t believe how up close and personal she became with the other participants, falling asleep on their laps and collapsing onto the floor. Ten students were hypnotized during the 
Inter-Residence Hall Association’s “Magical Mystery Tour” in Jennings Hall Saturday eve-ning.  They spoke imitation foreign languages, belly-danced, surfed and became Lady Gaga, when, in reality, their actions were merely fig-ments of their imagination.
When the hypnotist put the volunteers into 
a deep sleep, spectators moved to the edge of 
their seats, some flooding the front of the stage 
to get a better view. 
At one point, Alexander told the partici-
pants that the shoulder of the person next to them would have a heavenly scent. UF junior Lee Penn couldn’t believe he allowed himself to get so physically close to others. 
“I don’t normally touch other people, yet I was getting all over some girl’s shoulder,” Penn said.
To be hypnotized, Penn said he had to put 
himself in a state of mind where he truly be-lieved what Alexander was telling him. 
“It’s like when you watch a movie and you 
have to suspend your disbelief to get into it,” Penn said. “I had to think that it was real.”
Although the students did 
things they usually wouldn’t do, Alexander said hypnosis can occur only by one’s own will. 
“It’s a mental tool that we all have and most 
people don’t understand,” Alexander said. “If you have the attitude that you can’t be hypno-tized, it’ll never happen.”Having hypnotized about 20,000 people 
throughout his career, Alexander said he uses hypnotism not only to entertain but also to teach people how they can improve their lives. 
Alexander has used clinical hypnosis to 
help people quit smoking, lose weight and re-lieve stress and anxiety.
At the end of his act, Alexander told partic-
ipants they would have the ability to set goals for themselves from that day forward. 
Since the hypnotism, Read said she feels 
more driven to set and achieve goals.
“I don’t know if it’s me psyching myself 
out because I followed what he said to do while I was hypnotized,” Read said, “but I do believe it.”

A section of the Harn Museum of Art is under construction as a 26,000-square-foot Asian 
art wing is built for release to the public in spring 2012. The additions to the Asian art wing will make it the leading center for the study and preservation of Asian art in the southeast.

Alligator Contributing Writer
The Harn Museum of Art will open an ex-
panded 26,000-square-foot Asian art wing to 
the public in spring 2012. 
The new wing will hold 2,000 Asian art 
works from the permanent collection on ro-
tating view.
David A. Cofrin and his wife, Mary Ann,  
gave the museum a $10 million gift in sup-port of the museum’s new oriental expan-sion.
Cofrin entrusted a $1 million endowment 
for the acquisition of Asian art and 312 art pieces valued at $4.1 million. 
The wing will feature two Asian-inspired gardens, which will be named after Cofrin.
The galleries will be dedicated to art 
pieces from China, India, Japan, Korea, and 
South and Southeast Asia. 
This will make the museum the leading 
southeastern U.S. center for the study and 
preservation of Asian art influence.
“The new wing will create immense op-
portunities for engagement and collabora-tion with students and professors across academic departments at the University of Florida,” said Jason Steuber, the Cofrin cu-
rator of Asian art. “The Harn Museum will expand its leader -
ship role as a noted center for Asian art exhibitions, symposia, 
research and scholarly publications.”
Tami Wroath, director of marketing and 
public relations at the museum, said the Harn Museum will host a special “Museum Nights” event to celebrate the opening of the 
art wing.
Wroath said that over the next four to six 
months the team will announce the official

U.S. actions in Libya 
cue Iraq comparisons
The president must understand our fears about the 
situation in Libya. Why else would he stress his un-derstanding of the risks of any military action? Why 
would he emphasize and repeat his intentions of keeping U.S. troops off Libyan soil? Obama is seeing what we’re seeing — a frighteningly familiar scenario of international forces intervening in a country on the brink, complete with 
the undertones of terrorism and the memorable words of a 
crazy dictator. We’ve seen this movie before, and we know how it goes. Or do we?
We’ll be quick to point out that, according to our lead-
ers, this military action isn’t being led by the United States. 
Instead, it seems that the French, of all people, have taken 
charge. Also, there is more of a focus on the international outcry in the face of Gaddafi’s treatment of his own people. After all, the steps everyone is taking are in response to 
the UN’s imposition of a no-fly zone, which was requested 
by Libya’s own neighbors in the Arab League. Mere hours after the beginning of the military action, however, these neighbors began objecting to the use of force in the coun-try. Bombings that kill civilians, they say, shouldn’t be part 
of an operation meant to protect people from their own 
government.
Indeed, the international community may be shooting 
itself in the foot. We obviously are at odds with Gaddafi  
and his ilk, alarmed by the idea that someone would at-
tack his fellow countrymen from the air. He has a reputa-tion for sponsoring terrorist attacks, as John O. Brennan, Obama’s senior adviser on counterterrorism, has remind-ed us. Although we’re too young to remember it, our par -
ents have told us about the fate of Pan Am Flight 103. The threat is real.
There is another problem in who will replace Gaddafi. 
In the best-case scenario, a democracy will take root where 
politicians listen to the people, stay free of corruption and 
are friendly to the U.S. and our allies. Our own govern-ment doesn’t even accomplish two of those three on a regular basis. 
And the worst case? We’ll get someone who has the 
mental stability of the old leader, a background in terror -
ism and the evidence to turn his people off to the U.S. and the UN if we continue to count civilians among the casual-ties of the military action. This assumes we are success-
ful in ousting Gaddafi, the same man who swore to kill 
every last man, woman and child in Libya before he gave up power. The idea of pacifying the leader without finish-ing the job sounds entirely too much like Iraq. It makes us worry. It also harkens back to the questions we asked 
years ago: Should we get involved in another country’s 
internal problems — and when are we harming more than we are helping? In addition, we’re now left to ask whether an international coalition worth its salt can be successful 
without the U.S. at its helm.
We’re waiting to see the outcome, hoping that the peo-
ple of Libya can be free and thrive without the threat of an 
insane dictator’s ire looming over them. However, should a U.S. soldier’s boot touch Libyan soil, our president will have not only his own country but also the world to an-
swer to. He’s drawn a line in the sand, and he needs to 
stick to it.Critical analysis of evolution needed
Nearly everyone agrees that critical thinking is a skill essential for children to develop as early as possible. 
Throughout life, whether they are reading about his-
torical events, watching the news, talking with friends or solving complex homework problems, they will be forced to think critically about issues that confront them. Thus, it 
makes sense, and is good public policy, for public schools 
to expose children to a variety of appropriate issues and allow them to critically examine these issues. 
This is exactly what the Florida Senate has proposed to 
ensure in a recent bill, which would require critical analy-
sis of Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution 
content, as well as of the corrupt ideologies that led to the Holocaust; the contributions of women, African Ameri-cans, and Hispanic Americans to our history and culture; 
and other important concepts and ideas.
No one takes issue with these provisions of the 
bill, and most generally agree that critical analysis 
of these subjects is a laudable educational objective. Yet, Democratic legislators, the American Civil Liber -
ties Union and others still seek to sink the bill. Why? It is because SB 1854, as the legislation is known, also seeks to ensure a “thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution.” This sounds like a good 
idea, right? Apparently not. 
Evidently, it is not OK to critically examine evolution.
The ACLU has charged that this bill is a thinly veiled 
attempt by Sen. Stephen Wise, sponsor of the legislation, to introduce religion into science classrooms. OK. Even if 
it is, how does this change anything? Even if the sponsor 
of the bill does have ulterior motives in introducing it, the legislation’s language does not substitute Bible class for biology; it simply encourages criti-cal thinking by students. 
Do opponents of the bill want 
children to check their critical think-ing caps at the classroom door, or do they really want children to favor the ideas and ideologies that these 
opponents favor?
Taking arguments advanced by 
opponents such as Howard Simon, executive director of 
the Florida ACLU, to their logical extremes, discoveries by great scientists — Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, Michael 
Faraday, Lord Kelvin and Gregor Mendel, just to name a 
few — all would be suspect because they, in some way, co-mingled their scientific and religious beliefs. Even Albert Einstein, who disavowed belief in a personal god, could 
have his work called into question because he acknowl-
edged a belief that his god created the “immutable laws of nature.” Surely, opponents of the bill would not seek to stifle the critical thinking of Einstein, yet this is exactly what they seek to do to Florida’s school children.
The U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged that “teach-
ing a variety of scientific theories about the origins of hu-mankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of 
science instruction.”
Although the sponsor of this bill probably favors cre-
ationism over evolution, it seems clear he is aware of Su-
preme Court precedent in this area and crafted the bill to pass Constitutional muster and encourage students to 
think critically in a wide array of areas.

letters@alligator.orgMONDAY, MARCH 21, 2011 n  ALLIGATOR, 7
There are moments in time when I am immensely proud to be 
a Florida Gator. Thursday was one of them. No, it wasn’t due to many students’ impressive performances on St. Patty’s Day . 
It wasn’t even due to our dominance in basketball. It was due to the sight I witnessed at the candlelight vigil in commemoration of 
the disaster in Japan. Hundreds of students sat huddled in the Re-
itz Union Amphitheatre. There were students from all communities 
and cliques. Unity prevailed as all the stu-dents joined in praying for those affected by the tragedy and committing to doing all they can to help. We heard emotional tales of those 
here who know individuals who lost their homes and even their lives. Though the words were in Japanese, the emotion transcended language and generated compassion from all in attendance.
I am writing today not only to report on an event that made me 
indescribably proud of The Gator Nation but also to urge all reading to do what they can to aid the victims of the disaster. I understand times are tough, but please consider donating any spare change you may have. And please consider donating any of your spare time to-ward helping Hope for Japan as they organize our UF community in 
response to the disaster.
Those of us who were here when disaster struck Haiti know what 
we as a university community are capable of. 
Tragedy , despite the horror and sadness it brings, truly brings out 
the best in many people. Let’s do it again, Gators.

Speaking OutRowdy Reptile questions ticket pricing
While the Florida ticketing office may find it 
surprising that their 75 student tickets allotted for 
the UCSB and UCLA games didn’t sell out, I’m cer -
tainly not. Expecting students to pay $154 up front 
to watch the Gauchos and Bruins is asinine. 
With tuition hikes and scholarship cuts every 
year, finding 75 students willing to shell out that 
much money is going to be harder to do than find-ing a 2011 FSU graduate a job. Watching this bas-
ketball team “rise up” over the past four years, I’m 
really appalled by the ticketing office’s discourage-
ment of having that “sixth man” on the court via 
students in attendance. 
I’m not saying that boosters and alumni don’t 
cheer, but no one can argue that students don’t do it better. Whether it takes adding $5 to booster ticket 
prices to subsidize student tickets or just making 
the University Athletic Association take a hit, the responsibility for any lack of Gator spirit in later 
rounds of the NCAA tournament is going to rest 
solely on the UAA’s shoulders. 
Go Gators.
Jordan Ball
UF studentMardi Gras letter dull, condescending
First off, I must say I generally don’t read Tiffany 
Miles’ letters because, overall, I find their content to be dull and presented in a condescending manner.
My real complaint is with the letter in Wednes-
day’s edition entitled “Mardi Gras article embar -
rassing, trashy.”
I was embarrassed to even have a letter like this 
in my school newspaper. 
It only glorifies prudence and virtue (probably 
of a good nature as well), bookwormism and other -
wise total dullness. 
By focusing on nothing but the negative aspects 
of partying — not saying there are any negative ones —  the letter was the epitome of the smart-ass 
college kid who might have passed some tests but 
is not aware enough of her surroundings to know 
that nobody plays “wine-pong.”
Seriously.
The letter was trash, and it only made the al-
ready crappy editorial section even trashier. I will spread only negative things about Tiffany Miles un-
til she becomes fun.

Florida junior guard Erving Walker sinks a three during the last two minutes of UF’s 73-65 third-round victory over 
UCLA in the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa on Saturday. Walker led the Gators with 21 points.
UF MEN’S BASKETBALL
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer

TAMPA — After a year filled with clutch shots in big mo-
ments, there was little surprise when the Gators turned to Erv-
ing Walker with their season on the line.
Behind the junior guard’s game-high 21 points, including 10 
over the final four minutes, No. 2-seed Florida advanced to the Sweet 16 with a 73-65 win over seventh-seeded UCLA (23-11) on Saturday in the St. Pete Times Forum. The Gators (28-7) will face third-seeded BYU on Thursday in New Orleans after the Cougars scored an 89-67 win over Gonzaga on Saturday .  
“Erv is fearless,” senior forward Chandler Parsons said. 
“Any time the guy shoots the ball, I think it’s going in. He’s got a knack for hitting big shots.”
With 3:58 remaining and the Gators up by three, the 5-foot-8 
Walker drove the lane and hit an acrobatic jumper over 6-foot-10 UCLA center Joshua Smith. 
Two minutes later, Walker corralled an inbounds pass near 
midcourt, gathered himself and drilled a three, stretching UF’s lead to four.
“He lives for moments when the games are tight,” sopho-
more guard Kenny Boynton said. “He has a big heart and he’s not scared to take the big shot.”
Walker’s work wasn’t done there. With Florida ahead by four and less than 40 seconds to play, 
he twice beat the press, drew a foul and hit both free throws.
“He’s not afraid to fail,” senior center V ernon Macklin said. 
“He wants the ball in his hands at the end of the clock.”
Walker’s performance proved to be especially clutch fol-
lowing an injury to Boynton, who landed on Smith’s foot and twisted his left ankle after a jump shot.
Boynton checked out with about 4:30 left in the game, just 
before Walker’s run began.
Boynton wasn’t the only Gator trapped on the bench, as Ver -Walker leads Florida past UCLA, into Sweet 16
n THE EAGLES LEAD THE NCAA 
WITH 10.9 THREES PER GAME.

Instead of cats and dogs or stacks of mon-
ey , it will be raining three-pointers tonight in 
Fort Myers. 
After putting up 18 shots from the beyond 
the arc against UMBC on Friday, the Florida 
women’s basketball team (19-14) will test its 
shooting prowess against the NCAA’s top-
ranked team from long distance when it plays Florida Gulf Coast (28-3) tonight at 7 p.m. in Alico Arena.
“We have a tremendous challenge on 
(Monday) with Florida Gulf Coast,” coach Amanda Butler said Friday after defeating UMBC 59-47 in the first round of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament. “We know there are some things we have to do better.”
UMBC made 6 of 20 three-point attempts 
in Friday’s matchup. Guard Erin Brown ac-counted for five of those makes, but the Re-trievers had just one player (Brown) with 
more than 60 treys on the year. 
FGCU, meanwhile, has 
three. And the combo of 
Kelsey Jacobson, Shannon 
Murphy and Eglah Griffin has more three-pointers than the entire Gators ros-ter combined. 
FGCU leads the nation 
with an average of 10.9 three-pointers per game and has made a staggering 339 of 913 shots from downtown, good for 37.1 percent.
But the Gators rank second in the South-
eastern Conference with 184 threes, and guard UF looking to stop FGCU’s

After two consecutive dramatic 
comebacks and a gem featuring few 
offensive highlights, the top-ranked Gators won their eighth straight game Sunday, capping off a stellar week 
with a 7-3 drubbing of No. 5 LSU in 
Alex Box Stadium in Baton Rouge, La. 
Thanks in part to two unlikely stars, 
No. 1 Florida (18-2, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) pulled off their first-ever sweep at LSU, quieting a hostile crowd behind Austin Maddox’s arm and Jeff Moyer’s bat.
Maddox, primarily UF’s start-
ing first baseman, relieved freshman Karsten Whitson in the fifth inning af-
ter the phenom strug-gled with his com-mand in his first road start. 
Maddox was sur -
prisingly called upon in relief, but the bur -
ly right-hander promptly threw 4.1 scoreless innings, shutting down LSU Gators sweep Tigers 
behind Maddox, Moyer

n UF SCORED 226 POINTS, 198 
BEHIND FIRST-PLACE CALIFORNIA.
By MELISSA PENDER 
Alligator Writer
 
Despite their best efforts, the Gators 
were unable to recapture last year’s glory. 
The No. 7 Florida women’s team took 
seventh in this year’s NCAA swimming and diving championships with 226 points, falling six points behind sixth-place Texas. No. 2 California took home the title, rack-ing up 424 points.
Freshman Elizabeth Beisel led UF, final-
ing in three events over the three-day com-petition. She took second in the 400-yard individual medley, third in the 200 back-stroke and eighth in the 500 freestyle, earn-
ing five All-America accolades. 
Juniors Sarah Bateman, Teresa Crippen 
and Shara Stafford made the “A” finals in 
individual events as well, and senior diver Monica Dodson placed fifth in the 3-meter 
springboard competition.
“I’m so excited for Monica,” diving 
coach Donnie Craine said. “She’s never 
made the finals on any of the springboard events. She came in after winning the SEC 
Championships in the 3-meter and made 
[finaling] her goal.”
The Gators swam in the finals of two 
relay events, which they have struggled in all year due to health issues and lineup 
changes.
Bateman, Beisel, Stafford and fresh-
man Hilda Luthersdottir, who set a school record in the 100 breaststroke, took sixth place in the 400 medley relay. A fifth-place 
finish in the 800 free relay by the team of 
Beisel, Crippen, Stafford and sophomore 
Jamie Bohunicky propelling the Gators to seventh place at the end of the second day.
Bohunicky said she hopes this week-
end’s disappointment 
will help the team con-
tinue to improve and eventually retake the title 
next season.
“Obviously this isn’t 
where we wanted to finish, but I’m still 
proud of the Gator spirit we showed in con-tinuing to fight and persevere,” she said. “I 
couldn’t be more proud of this team, and I 
know that this experience will help us next 
year.”The swimmers’ performances earned 38 
All-America honors overall. Florida head coach Gregg Troy said he blames the coach-
es, not the swimmers, for UF falling short.
“I’m extremely proud of how the team 
competed,” Troy said. “We fought hard 
all weekend long. As a staff, we probably 
didn’t do as good of a job as getting them 
prepared as we would have liked, but it 
was tremendous effort on their part.” 
He said the health issues the team has 
faced this year, including Stafford’s ab-sence during the end of the season, held 
them back, but the team kept a positive at-
titude during the championships.
“They showed a lot of character and 
mental toughness in the adversity they 
overcame not only this week, but the entire 
season,” he said.Florida women finish disappointing seventh at NCAA meetUF GYMNASTICS

The Gators rolled up to the Bir -
mingham Jefferson Civic Center 
prepared to defend their confer -
ence title, but after small mistakes, 
mild sicknesses and pestering in-juries, they fell short.
No. 1 Florida (17-2, 5-1 South-
eastern Conference) was edged out of the SEC Championship by Alabama (17-1, 5-1) on Saturday, as the Crimson Tide scored a 
197.225 to UF’s 196.975.
The Gators kicked off the meet 
with a phenomenal warm-up and aggressive performances on bars, but the competition went south 
when the team entered its beam and floor routines.
“It just seemed like the athletes 
got really tight and had some un-characteristic wobbles that we normally don’t have,” said coach Rhonda Faehn, who was named SEC Coach of the Year in a post-
meet ceremony.
Freshman Mackenzie Caquatto, 
a usual beam star, had to sit out af-
ter rolling an ankle in practice last 
week. Sophomore Ashanée Dick-
erson, who felt under the weather throughout the competition, post-ed a 9.625.
“Poor Nay,” Faehn said. “Com-
ing off the bus, she had flu-like symptoms. She felt like she was go-ing to throw up pretty much most 
of the night.”
D i c k e r s o n 
stuck it out and competed in all four events, join-
ing freshman 
Alaina John-son in the all-around.
Although the beam lineup was 
missing Caquatto, whom Faehn said is the team’s top performer in the event, senior Alicia Goodwin stepped up to round out the squad and scored a 9.9 — the best of her 
college career.
However, the Gators failed 
to maintain their momentum on 
floor exercise, mainly due to land-
ing mistakes on tumbling passes.
Johnson and senior Maranda 
Smith came through for the Gators 
with their performances, each earning a 9.9. 
Johnson’s combined scores 
earned her the second place in the all-around, and she earned SEC Freshman of the Year honors fol-
lowing the competition.The freshman said she loved 
every minute of the meet, but in 
the end, the little flaws were too much for the Gators to overcome.
“Everything counts,” she said. 
“We just weren’t quite as aggres-sive as we should’ve been. Even though we got second, that just makes us want to work harder in the gym and focus on every detail 
and every thing up for nationals.”
With a week off before the 
NCAA Regional Championships, 
Faehn said she is focused on get-
ting her athletes back in the gym 
and getting their bodies healthy again.

SwimmingJordan Jones has 69 makes while 
shooting better than 38 percent. 
She made three of four against 
UMBC while leading all scorers with 18 points and said afterward she thrives in the tournament set-ting.
“This time of the year, it’s win or 
go home,” Jones said. “There’s defi-
nitely a different mindset. I enjoy 
this. I enjoy the pressure of just com-ing out here and knowing we have to win to advance.”
Jones has made a habit of step-
ping up late in the year, as she holds the Postseason WNIT record for 
three-pointers made in a game with 
nine against North Carolina A&T on March 21, 2008. 
But that was a home game as a 
member of South Carolina, a much 
different atmosphere than Jones and 
Florida will face when they enter Alico Arena.
On the strength of their outside 
shooting, the Eagles have won 42 
straight at home and boast a better 
home winning percentage than Ten-nessee since moving to Division I four years ago. 
“Nationally , their record speaks 
for itself,” Butler said. “They are a tough matchup for us, but we’re ex-
cited to still be playing.”
She said the Gators didn’t com-
municate well in Friday’s win over 
UMBC, something that will be criti-cal in limiting long-distance oppor -
tunities against FGCU. 
Butler also added that the usual 
strategies for stopping three-point sharp-shooters might not apply against the Eagles.  
“The easy answer about how to 
defend the three is play tough man 
defense and really pressure the ball, 
but they are too good to do just that,” Butler said. “There’s not just one answer about how to stop their 
three-point success.”
FGCU’s only victory over UF 
came at home to open the 2008-09 
season. 
The Gators ended the Eagles’ 
season the year before with a sec-ond-round WNIT victory in the O’Connell Center, something Jones thinks will happen again tonight.
“They hate the Gators,” Jones 
said. “I’m excited for the challenge and ready to get down there and ad-vance in this tournament.”MONDAY, MARCH 21, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Guard Jordan Jones has made 55.2 percent of her threes the last five 
games, and UF will need that to continue to match FGCU tonight.
Boynton leaves game with ankle sprain, hopes to be ready for BYU
non Macklin, Patric Young and Erik Murphy 
were all limited by foul trouble following in-tense, physical battles with Smith. 
“Everybody is ready to come and step up,” 
Young said. “On any given night, somebody could have a great game.”
Seven different Gators scored at least sev-
en points, with a total of 15 coming from UF’s 
bench.With his frontcourt teammates in foul trou-
ble, senior Alex Tyus stepped up and notched 
eight points and a game-high 13 rebounds in a season-high 33 minutes, providing the  prow-ess on the glass he predicted UF would need.
“I’ve never met a guy who watches bas-
ketball and knows basketball like Alex Tyus,” Macklin said. “He actually said before the game, ‘This is one of those games I have to re-bound. I have to rebound and go to the glass relentlessly.’ And that’s what he did.”
Saturday’s game, which featured 11 ties and 10 lead changes, was hotly contested from start to finish, as neither team led by 
more than five for the first 34 minutes, something the Gators have grown accus-tomed to in a season full of 
close calls.
“I’m kind of used to 
that feeling with, ‘Oh no, 
we might lose,’” Young 
said. “I’m getting used to that feeling because I know we’re going to come through in the end.”
INJURY UPDATE: Boynton’s injury has been di-
agnosed as a mild left ankle sprain, the sopho-
more guard said.
He briefly returned to action, but the pain 
severely limited him and coach Billy Donovan 
decided to keep him on the bench. 
“I’m going to try to do therapy all day this 
week and be back by Thursday,” Boynton said.

(16-4, 0-3 SEC) and earning his first collegiate victory.  
Entering Sunday, the sophomore fireballer had tossed 
just 3.2 innings all season, but he said afterward his arm felt 
great despite throwing more pitches than he had since high school.
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan has preached all year about his 
confidence in Maddox as a valuable bullpen arm and said, “I know he hasn’t thrown a whole lot, but we weren’t going to 
bring him out of the game unless we got into trouble.”
Florida displayed its deep bullpen all series against LSU, 
as five pitchers combined for 10.1 innings, 11 strikeouts, one 
walk and just one earned run. 
In Friday’s 5-4 win, Anthony DeSclafani escaped a jam in 
the bottom of the ninth and earned his third save of the sea-
son. After Hudson Randall pitched 6.2 shutout innings on 
Saturday, lefty Nick Maronde closed the game, striking out 
the final four hitters in UF’s 1-0 win. 
“Our bullpen was outstanding,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It’s a team sport. You never 
know who is going to be the hero, and today was Jeff Moyer coming off the bench, and Maddox coming out of the bullpen. You just never know, but it was a great team effort.”
Down 3-0 in the fourth, the Gators rallied for five runs, 
including three with two outs. The inning was highlighted by Moyer’s two-out pinch-hit single up the middle, plating 
two and giving Florida the lead. 
“That was a clutch at-bat there,” O’Sullivan said. “Those 
two out hits win ball games.”
Moyer, who was 3 for 3 with three RBIs, added an insur -
ance run in the ninth with a towering shot into the right-field 
bleachers. 
“Sully called my number,” Moyer said. “It’s great that he 
has trust in me.
“I haven’t seen a team like this before,” the junior transfer 
added. “It could be anyone on any given night. Sully and [assistant coach] Brad [Weitzel] do a great job plugging guys in where they can thrive and help the team.” Bullpen strikes out

Florida continued its conference domi-
nance this weekend.
For the third time this month, the No. 2 
Gators (30-1, 7-0 Southeastern Conference) 
swept an SEC opponent, and for the fifth consecutive game, freshman Hannah Rogers started and shut down a team from Missis-sippi. 
After earning two wins against Missis-
sippi State on Wednesday and two more against Ole Miss Friday and Saturday, the young righty picked up her 16th victory as the Gators took advantage of the Rebels’ se-vere control issues to win 11-3.
Rogers allowed three unearned runs on 
two hits in five innings, struck out four bat-ters and lowered her ERA to a team-leading 0.43. 
Rogers has had to shoulder the load re-
cently with Stephanie Brombacher sidelined with arm pain. 
Although there is no timetable for Brom-
bacher’s return, Rogers has proven more than capable of being the team’s top pitcher. 
“We haven’t had just one kid get the ball in 
five straight games in a long time,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “Her strength and depend-
ability warranted her going out there.” 
While some would think the high num-ber of starts could result in fatigue, the actual 
workload was manageable. 
Over the past five days, Rogers threw 220 
pitches over 23 innings. By comparison, three 
Rebels pitchers combined 
for 177 pitches Sunday.  
Although the Gators 
didn’t put Sunday’s game 
out of reach until the final inning, they drew 15 walks, had 10 hits and outscored 
the Rebels 37-6 this week-end. 
Down 3-2 after four in-
nings, UF scored nine runs during the final three to seal the victory.“A lot of times people think drawing a lot 
of walks makes it easier to hit,” Walton said. “But sometimes it’s the opposite. We strug-gled the first three innings, but then we got some big hits in key situations.” 
The Gators’ patience resulted in two bas-
es-loaded walks in the fifth to give them the lead. 
Right fielder Kelsey Horton, who had 
three RBIs, added another run with her sixth-inning single before UF exploded for six more in the final frame.  
The scoring was led by two of the Gators’ 
most consistent hitters, seniors Kelsey 
Bruder and Megan Bush, who each drove 
in two runs on the day.Rogers dominates Rebels as Gators earn series sweep

n THE WIN WAS UF’S SEC-
OND OVER A TOP-15 TEAM.

Syracuse constantly shadowed 
Florida’s top scoring threat, chasing 
Kitty Cullen all over the field Satur -
day.
But as the No. 11 Orange (2-4) 
soon found out, there’s more than one piece to No. 10 UF’s offense.
Behind a career-high-tying six 
goals from sophomore Ashley Bruns, the Gators (8-1) scored their second win of the season over a top-15 opponent, beating Syracuse 16-11 at Dizney Stadium.
“You can’t ask for anything more 
from Ashley ,” UF coach Amanda 
O’Leary said. “She was dominant 
on the offensive and also on the ride as well. Not really much more to say than she was the driving force today.”
In the first half, Cullen was re-
peatedly face-guarded by Orange defenders, effectively taking her out of the game. No. 9 Georgetown tried 
a similar tactic on March 9, but Cul-
len was still able to net four goals.
Syracuse’s defense found suc-
cess with the strategy, as Orange de-fender Becca Block held Cullen, the nation’s leading scorer, without a shot attempt in the first 30 minutes.“It wasn’t a surprise. Kitty’s 
been playing very well this season, so I think we knew it was going to 
come,” Bruns said. “We’ve been 
working on ways to get her open, setting picks and screens, and it ended up working really well to-day.”
With one option out of the 
Gators’ arsenal, the offense cen-tered around 
Bruns, who tied a 
school record with her six goals, and 
fellow midfielder Brittany Dashiell. The pair combined for five first-half goals to give their team a 6-5 lead at the break.Dashiell was coming off a five-
goal game against Colgate and continued her hot streak with three 
more. The sophomore was also criti-
cal in helping Florida win the pos-session battle, taking all the team’s faceoffs and finishing tied with a game-high four draw controls.
“If you possess the ball, the other 
team can’t score,” O’Leary said. “For us to get those 18 draws was critical, because we needed posses-
sion of the ball. ... If you give them 
an inch, the ball’s going in the back of the net unfortunately.”
The Gators owned four of the 
first five possessions in the second half due to Dashiell’s work on fa-ceoffs, allowing the offense to score three goals in two minutes.
As the Orange’s defense scram-
bled to get set after Florida won 
control, the Gators finally worked 
the ball into Cullen, who notched three second-half goals.
“All seven of our attackers can 
come in and score,” Dashiell said. “Taking out one player isn’t going to make that big of a difference, so we just used her and used that face-guard to our advantage.”
With Cullen just starting to get 
involved, Bruns continued her strong play well into the second half. The midfielder had a hand in three straight goals for the Gators, scoring two and dishing out an as-sist on another.
