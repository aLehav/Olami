Alligator Staff Report
Alachua County residents had 
their say in Tuesday’s primary elec-
tion, with 41,357 people — about 
a 25-percent turnout — voting for candidates in local elections and general primaries.
The general election is now just 
under three months away, on Nov. 8.
In arguably the biggest race of 
the night across the state, former 
U.S. presidential candidate Sen. 
Marco Rubio won the Republican nomination for Senate candidacy, walking away with 80.78 percent of 
the vote. Rep. Patrick Murphy won 
the Democratic nomination for Sen-
ate, winning with 45.17 percent of the vote. The two will face off on Election Day in November. 
Locally, current Alachua County 
Sheriff Sadie Darnell defeated Zac Zedalis, a former UF football player and ACSO deputy in the Democratic primary, sweeping in 71.85 percent of the vote. She will now face Jack Jacobs in the general election. 
Supervisor of Elections Pam Car-
penter said voter turnout was up from the usual 20 percent. 
“I think there’s an increased in-
terest in this election,” she said. “I think you’ll also see that in Novem-ber.”
Five precincts had issues sending votes via modem and telephone line to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce, despite checking to make sure the telephone lines at polling precincts worked earlier in the day. 
One precinct in High Springs and 
one in Alachua had to bring ballots into the Supervisor of Elections of-ﬁ  ce to be directly fed into the sys-tem, Carpenter said. Another pre-cinct had to have its telephone line repaired after a hedgecutter mowed over it.
Despite the wait for results, more 
than 100 supporters gathered at First Magnitude Brewing Company. Cheers of victory rang out for two county commissioners.
Mike Byerly and Robert “Hutch” 
Hutchinson won re-election for Dis-tricts 1 and 3, respectively.
The Democratic commissioners, 
who both share a progressive con-stituency, held a joint watch party at the brewery.
Byerly, who will now begin his 
ﬁ  fth term as commissioner for Dis-trict 1, looked concerned all eve-ning, eventually winning over Kev-in Thorpe.
Byerly prepared two speeches 
just in case, he said.
Both he and Hutchinson thanked 
their families, staff members and supporters.
Hutchinson said he wasn’t 
surprised by the outpour of support. He said although national politics seem to take priority over local issues, it is the local elections that affect the day-to-day lives of voters.Gainesville resident Ewen Thom-
son joined Byerly and Hutchinson at the watch party at the brewery. 
The 66-year-old emigrated from New Zealand and became a U.S. citizen three weeks ago. He cast his ﬁ  rst vote in a U.S. election Tuesday

Starting today, Alachua Coun-
ty residents can pick up sandbags 
to prepare for a tropical depres-sion.
As Tropical Depression Nine 
follows its projected path toward Florida, Gainesville and UF of-
ﬁ  cials have set up an area for 
residents to pick up sandbags at 11855 NW U.S. Highway 441 from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Members of the emergency 
operation center met Tuesday morning to discuss and prepare for the tropical depression that may hit Gainesville, Alachua 
County spokesman Mark Sexton 
said. Sandbags are used to pre-vent ﬂ  ooding in buildings.
“It’s always a good idea to 
hope for the best and prepare for 
the worst,” Sexton said. 
He added the depression may 
become a tropical storm named 
Hermine.
Sexton said citizens should 
stock up on food and water and stay updated on the tropical de-pression’s path via social media or radio.

Access Party will not be running 
for Fall Student Government elec-
tions. 
The party, which registered 
Thursday with the UF Supervisor of Elections, won’t be nominating candidates for Fall elections, said 
Access President Michael Russel. 
“While we will not be slating 
candidates this season, we will not 
be silent,” Russel said. “This elec-tion, students will ﬁ  nd out what 
it truly means to move all Gators 
forward.”UF Supervisor of Elections Eric 
Hobbs conﬁ  rmed Access will not be interviewing candidates. He wrote in an email that Deez Nuts, Pants 
Party, Squirrel Party, Taco Libre 
and Frat Party have registered and are eligible, but only Impact Party will interview students for Senate.
Through Senate legislation, Ac-
cess plans to address remote online voting, campaign ﬁ  nance spending and regulations on when and how parties operate, Russel said. 
Access senators will remain af-
ﬁ  liated with the party, but it’s unclear whether Access will have candidates for the Spring election, 
he said. Students who want to get 
involved with SG should run as in-dependents or with other parties. 
“As long as there is a systematic 
effort to disenfranchise 80 percent of students from Student Govern-
ment, there will always be an inde-
pendent movement,” Russel said. 
Access ﬁ  rst registered in the 
Spring 2015 elections; the party 
won the executive ticket and 27 
Senate seats, according to Alliga-tor archives. In the Spring 2016 election, Access lost the executive ticket to Impact Party and won 11 
Senate seats.

University Police is hiring a third victim 
advocate this Fall.
The department’s Victim Services Pro-
gram has had two advocates since its 
founding in 1993, said Annie Carper, a UPD victim advocate. But over the last ﬁ  ve years, the number of people asking for vic-
tim advocates has risen.“It’s been a steady climb,” she said.
Victim advocates help those who have 
experienced domestic violence, dating vio-lence, sexual assault, identity theft or are experiencing grief, Carper said.
In the past year, the two advocates have 
helped more than 260 people, she said. 
UPD’s Ofﬁ  ce of Victim Services serves all 
UF students and faculty, UF Health Shands Hospital patients and non-students who are victimized on campus.By having a third advocate, Carper said 
she hopes UPD will be able to expand edu-
cation efforts to tell students about the re-
sources available to them if they have been victimized.  
“Our campus as a whole has worked 
incredibly diligently to create a culture of 
support,” Carper said. “We’ve been oper-
ating as two, so the third person will be incredibly helpful.”
Nicole Bowen, a UF ﬁ  nance freshman, said she’s glad UF is getting another ad-
vocate.
“I think it’s cool that the school is kind 
of engaged with the national conversa-
tion,” the 17-year-old said. 
Those who are interested in  the posi-
tion can apply at explore.jobs.uﬂ  .edu/cw/

One water lily pad at Kanapaha Botani-
cal Gardens is making a splash in the record 
books. 
The Gainesville botanical garden, located at 
4700 SW 58th Drive, now holds the world re-cord for the largest Victoria cruziana lily pad.  It has an 85-inch diameter. 
This is the second lily-pad record for the 
garden in eight years — a Victoria ‘Longwood Hybrid’ broke records with a diameter just shy of 8 feet in 2007. But the lily pad, planted this past June, will only be around until October, 
said Kanapaha Botanical Gardens director 
Alexis Caffrey.
Because the cruziana lily pad thrives in 
tropical climates and is sensitive to tempera-
ture changes, the record-breaking pad will 
eventually wither away in cold weather. 
“They’ve been growing from a pea-sized 
seed every year,” Caffrey said, “and this is (visitors’) one chance to see them.” 
The cruziana lily pad was planted after 
seeds were cultivated in a greenhouse aquarium during the winter, and the lily broke the record in late August. Caffrey attributes 
the pad’s large size to the murky, organic 
soil it was planted in and a heavy amount of fertilizer. “I would suspect it could hold a small 
child,” said Michael Kane, a professor in the 
UF Environmental Horticulture Department. 
“They’re pretty resilient.”
Caffrey said she hopes a lot of people come 
to see the lily pad before winter comes. As of press time, a Facebook post about the record has received about 1,200 likes.
“We’ve gotten a lot of publicity,” she said. 
“I tell everyone that comes in to go to the boardwalk (where the lily can be seen from).”

for the likelihood of a tropical storm 
through social media, said Kenneth 
Allen, the director of the department.
“Now is the time to take action,” 
Allen said. “What we don’t want is students going into a storm unpre-
pared.”
Allen said students should put 
together a hurricane kit, which can include a flashlight, first aid supplies 
and pet care items.
UF Housing and Residence Edu-
cation will also reach out to on-cam-
pus residents, Allen said.
Sharon C. Blansett, the assistant 
to the associate vice president for Student Affairs, wrote in an email  that housing staff and resident as-sistants are trained in crisis manage-
ment procedures, including weather-
related emergencies.
UF Housing began its emergency 
plan Friday in preparation for the 
depression, Blansett said. In case of 
flooding, housing staff has plans to 
mitigate excess rainwater on campus 
locations, she said. 
Blansett suggests everyone be 
self-sufficient by planning for three to seven days’ worth of water, food and medicine.
“That being said, UF has a part-
nership with Gator Dining Service 
to support the campus — staff and students — during weather emergen-cies,” Blansett said.
Benjamin Narzissenfeld, 20, said 
he is not prepared for the storm be-cause he was not aware one is head-ing toward Gainesville.
The history junior, said he thinks 
Floridians are reluctant to prepare for storms or hurricanes.
He said he will consider buying 
an umbrella and a raincoat for the upcoming storm. 
“If it becomes a hurricane, then 
I’ll be scared s---less,” he said.

The UF Supreme Court es-
tablished procedures for re-viewing Student Government petitions Tuesday night.
In the unanimous decision, 
the court decided to give 20 minutes for both the petitioner and the respondent when a pe-tition is submitted. During this time, one person will be able to state the petition, answer questions from the court and set aside five of the 20 min-utes for rebuttal if he or she chooses.
Only one person will be al-
lowed to speak on behalf of the petition, said Chief Justice Christopher Tribbey. The first person who signs the petition will email the chief justice to say who the consul will be.
The court will only consider 
arguments concerning the pe-tition, he said.
Currently, Global Vote has submitted two petitions re-garding a Supreme Court de-
cision from the summer to 
overturn four amendments 
that date back to 2008. When the petitions are reviewed next week, a representative from 
Global Vote will argue against 
UF SG Solicitor General Nick 
Smith. 
Tribbey said he hasn’t 
heard whether Smith will be at the meeting.
Tyler Richards, a co-found-
er of Global Vote, said he was happy with the ruling.
“We came in wanting to ar-
gue on behalf of the thousands of students,” the 20-year-old UF industrial and systems en-gineering junior said. “Today, we did that.”
The Supreme Court will 
meet Sept. 6 at 5 p.m. in UF’s Levin College of Law, Room 285C.

Students will get the chance to vote on an amend-
ment to the UF Constitution during Spring elections. 
During Tuesday night’s Student Senate meeting, 
senators approved a bill that places an amendment on 
the ballot that will allow students to decide how many 
signatures are needed for student petitions. The amend-ment, if passed, will lower the percentage from 10 per-cent to 5 percent of the Student Body.
The amendment was previously in the UF Constitu-
tion and was voted on in Spring 2010, according to the bill authored by Senate President Jenny Clements. The UF Supreme Court released an opinion over summer overturning the original amendment. 
Senate also approved four students for the Local Fee 
Committee. All but one of the students were nominated by UF Student Body President Susan Webster. Gabriella Larios is a returning member of the committee.
Larios, Ty Robare, Haley Smith and Ian Green will 
meet in October to set the limit for the activity and ser-
vice fee, the athletic fee and the health fee, Webster said.  
Webster said her three nominees served on the Bud-
get and Appropriations Committee, and she said she felt 
that made them qualified.  
“I think they would be good students to represent 
student interests,” Webster said. “They’re very well versed on how service fees work.” 
Senate also approved funding for the Nepalese Stu-
dent Association, which received $532. Senate approved $1,153.35 in funding for the Gator Guard Drill Team.

A week after being charged with 
attempted sexual battery, an Alachua 
County assistant attorney has commit-ted suicide, Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies said Tuesday.
On Aug. 24, Gainesville Police arrest-
ed 54-year-old Robert Livingston IV and charged him with attempting to sexually assault two minors.
On Tuesday, deputies found the 
54-year-old dead in a canoe on Newn-ans Lake, said spokesman Art Forgey. 
Livingston had shot himself, Forgey 
said.
The sheriff’s office received a call 
at about 10 a.m. that a man who rent-ed a canoe from Kate’s Fish Camp in Gainesville on Monday night had not returned it, Forgey said. About an hour later, deputies spotted Livingston’s body via helicopter after searching the 
5,800-acre lake by boat and air.
The District Eight Medical Examin-
er’s Office will now conduct an autopsy 
to determine the exact cause of death.
“We’ll go ahead and work the case 
and finish the case and close it,” Forgey said.
As of press time, Livingston is still 
listed as one of three assistant attorneys 
employed by the county, according to 
the county’s website. He was listed as the president of Gainesville Area Row-ing, according to a page on its website that has since been removed.
Following his arrest, he was placed 
on administrative leave with pay, said Mark Sexton, a county spokesman, in a statement issued Aug. 25.“Mr. Livingston is at the beginning 
of a legal process,” the statement read. “The County has taken the appropriate 
step based on the information we have 
available to us at this time.”
The charges stemmed from incidents 
that occurred in 2012 and then 2016, when Livingston would molest two un-derage girls as they slept, according to a police report. 
When one of the girls, now 17, tried 
to flee, Livingston and his wife Melissa 
Latham Livingston, 63, used force in an 
attempt to stop her, according to the re-port.
During the escape, Melissa grabbed 
the girl around the neck and pushed her against a washing machine, according to the report. After the girl broke away, Livingston pinned her to the ground, but the girl’s younger sister distracted him, giving the girl time to run to a neighbor’s house and call police.
The altercation left the girl with 
bruises, rug burns and scratches, ac-cording to the report.
Police arrested Robert Livingston 
and charged him with two counts of at-tempted sexual battery on a victim 12 years old or greater and child abuse without great bodily harm. Melissa was arrested and charged with one count of child abuse without great bodily harm.
Both were taken to the Alachua 
County Jail, where Robert was released 
Thursday on a $50,000 bond and Melis-
sa was released Thursday on a $10,000 bond.

ing on fentanyl during a Narcotics Anonymous meeting.
The teen was found uncon-
scious and barely breathing as he lay on the bathroom ﬂ  oor of First Presbyterian Church, according to an incident report. He survived after ﬁ  rst responders administered Naloxone, an anti-overdose medi-cation, but others like him have not been as fortunate.
In Florida over the past ﬁ  ve 
years, deaths caused by fentanyl — a powerful opioid — have nearly doubled, according to a report pub-lished Thursday by UF Health. It was co-authored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“Fentanyl is a powerful pain 
medication often used in cancer patients, for example,” said Chris Delcher, a UF assistant professor in the Department of Health Out-comes and Policy in the College of Medicine. “And it’s about 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.”
Deaths from fentanyl overdose 
increased by more than 53 percent between 2010 and 2014, according to the report. During this period, however, the prescription rate for the drug remained relatively un-changed, meaning users obtained fentanyl illegally.
Ernest Bordini, a Gainesville-based addiction counselor at Clini-cal Psychology Associates of North Central Florida, conﬁ  rmed the 
study’s ﬁ  ndings.
A decade ago, Bordini said, 
cases of narcotics addiction were 
uncommon in his ofﬁ  ce.
“Most of them were alcohol, pot 
and cocaine,” he said. “But certain-ly in the last ﬁ  ve years narcotic ad-diction referrals have become very common.”
Lt. Brett Rowlands, who works 
on the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-ﬁ  ce Drug Task Force, said the rise in fentanyl deaths stems from the once-rampant sale of prescription pain pills across the state.
About ﬁ  ve years ago, when lo-
cal and federal law enforcement agencies began to more effectively crack down on pill sales in South Florida, many addicts in the state 
turned to heroin.
“The problem is that we have 
tens of thousands of opiate-depen-
dent people now running around that became addicts,” Rowlands said.
To take advantage of the new 
market, Mexican drug cartels started exporting heroin that was 
laced with fentanyl because it was 
cheaper than selling pure heroin, Rowlands said.
“(Most people who overdose on 
the drug) are not actively seeking fentanyl,” Rowlands said. “What they’re doing is that they’re com-ing across heroin that is laced with fentanyl.”
At UF Health Shands Hospital 
following Friday’s overdose, the teenager told police he smokes fen-tanyl to battle his depression and he buys it online.
Rowlands said police can’t do 
much to prevent overdoses, but if the task force learns of a case, the group thoroughly investigates it 
and try to ﬁ  nd its origin.
Delcher said researching the 
tendencies and demographics of 
average heroin users could help curb these kinds of overdoses.
“If we do want to jump on these 
kinds of problems faster,” he said, “we deﬁ  nitely need to improve our ability to collect this kind of data 
faster.”

STUDENTS CAN CALL
911 THROUGH 
THE APP .
By Justin T ompkins
Alligator Contributing Writer
Throughout the week, Santa 
Fe College students will be able 
to learn more about a free new 
campus app during the college’s 
Safe Santa Fe Days.
This is the ﬁ  rst Fall semes-
ter  during which students will 
be able to use Safe Santa Fe, an 
app that allows students to sig-nal emergency, contact 911 and get information about buses, weather and emergencies. The 
app is modeled after UF’s Ga-
torSafe app. 
“We’ve been looking at it for 
two or three years, but within 
the last year we knew that UF 
was also moving towards a mo-bile campus safety app,” said Ed Book, the Santa Fe Santa Fe Col-lege Police Department’s chief 
of police. “We’re good partners 
with them, so (we) were look-ing at exactly the same thing.”
The features of the app were 
decided by  Santa Fe Police, 
Santa Fe’s Student Government 
and other faculty and staff. App developer AppArmor Mobile provided a template for the app. 
“Our students, staff and fac-
ulty who are familiar with San-ta Fe’s (app) would be just as comfortable with UF’s and vice versa,” Book said. 
While the app, released July 5, is a highlight of the Safe San-
ta Fe Days, 90-minute sessions 
are also being held to discuss resources offered by Santa Fe Police. 
Sean Ahmadzadeh, a Santa 
Fe business sophomore, said he started using the app after he attended one of the educational sessions. 
“The app is a good way to in-
form students on campus and to be aware,” the 19-year-old said.  Santa Fe releases

After ﬁ  ve months of expansion, the High Springs 
branch of the Alachua County Library announced 
plans for a grand re-opening in late September. 
The grand opening will take place at the branch’s 
building, located at 23779 U.S. Highway 27,  across from the High Springs Fire Department, at 10 a.m. on Sept. 24. The expansion, which has added about 3,000 square feet to the current building, cost $548,000, said Renee Patterson, a technical services administrator for the library. 
“Expansion and renovations are part of our 20-year 
plan to meet the needs of our growing communities,” Patterson said. “The High Springs community has been a big supporter of the library from the beginning.”
The expansion at the library began March 14, 
according to the Alachua County Library District website. The additional space will include a larger meeting room, a quiet reading room, new restrooms and two study rooms. The existing library space has also been renovated to include a teen room and a children’s room, said Alyce Brown, a librarian at the High Springs library.
“We are the heartbeat of High Springs,” said Brown. 
“The expansion was designed to meet the needs of our High Springs community.” 
The new study rooms offer space to provide 
additional basic literacy and English for Speakers of Other Languages services to adults who struggle with reading or want to learn English. The larger meeting room will accommodate groups for programs and community meetings, Patterson said.
Along with the building, the library will also be 
expanding the parking lot and its DVD collection, which makes up one-third of the library’s checkouts, said Margaret Schmelz, a library page at the High Springs library.
“The expansion is very modern and patron-
friendly, and a lot of thought has been put into it,” Schmelz said. 
Judith Futch, a library patron who has been visiting 
the library for 30 years, said she was looking forward to the new expansion. 
“I think it’s wonderful,” she said. “I think it’s great 
because the space was very limited, and now they’ll be able to have more programs.” High Springs library to open expansion

ColumnOh, say can you
 see the nonsense
It’s time we have the talk: not the momma-bird, poppa-bird 
talk you were warned about in elementary school (hope-fully), but rather, the Colin Kaepernick talk. For those of you who don’t know, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback sparked some serious outrage when he unapologetically re-
fused to stand up during the playing of the national anthem during Friday’s game between the 49ers and the Green Bay Packers.
“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a ﬂ  ag for a 
country that oppresses black people and people of color,” he told NFL Media after the game. On Sunday, he defended his decision to the San Jose Mercury Times, stating, “There are a lot of things that are going on that are unjust, people aren’t being held accountable for, that’s something that needs to change… 
this country stands for liberty, freedom, justice for all. And it’s 
not happening for all right now.”
So, the million-dollar question: Is Kaepernick wrong for not 
honoring the national anthem? Well, for what’s probably the ﬁ  rst time in the history of the human race, you can actually ﬁ  nd a decent answer to this question on Twitter: “It’s his right to sit. And it’s my right to say he’s an a--hole.” In other words, it doesn’t really matter.
With any sort of nonviolent form of protest like Kaeper-
nick’s, we should all ﬁ  rst address the intended message of the protest — the conversation the protester wants us all to have.
There are many great things to love about our country, truly. 
But there is also no denying that our country has a record of unnecessary violence, immense corruption and tragedy that continues to this day, despite our claims of exceptional liberty, equality and greatness. How do we live with that? And, as Kae-pernick was speciﬁ  cally concerned with, how do we praise our national anthem with all of this in mind?
It’s a pretty clear message, and no matter how you feel about 
Kaepernick’s actions, the conversation he — along with many, many others — wants to have is a necessary one. It’s the kind of conversation that will make us better countrymen: to be able to love your country enough to criticize it in the hopes of making it better for everyone.
Unfortunately, there is this thing called social media and 
these people called trolls.
So, instead of having the conversations we should be having, 
we’re talking about whether Kaepernick, half-white and half-black, can really talk about the issues facing Black America. Instead, we’re talking about whether Kaepernick hates America, hates veterans or is simply unpatriotic. Some have even gone as far as to say Kaepernick and those who would defend him should leave the country.
Let’s be real, here: Nobody owns patriotism. Jon Stewart 
reminded us of this when he brieﬂ  y hosted “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” on July 21 to put Fox News in its place 
for its stomach-twisting favoritism toward You-Know-Who. Re-
publicans don’t own patriotism. Democrats don’t own it. And obnoxious football fans on social media deﬁ  nitely do not own it (God help us all if they did). 
You can agree with Kaepernick’s decision to protest the na-
tional anthem. You can disagree with it. You can be indifferent. We won’t tell you what position to take. What we will encour-age you to do is shut out all the sensationalism and senseless bickering going on. Focus on the real message behind Kaeper-
nick’s action.
The longer we delay a conversation about our country’s 
serious issues, the more pain and unrest we will have to live 
through.
 Your brain. Your ideas. Your emotions.
We spend most of the time in our 
lives trying to build a good routine 
and find stability, but eventualities 
find the cracks in our structure, and 
it seems like we have to start all over again.
We are human, and developing a pattern 
gives us a sense of comfort. We think like this because when we are able to recognize something, we assume we are able to predict the outcome of it. Since ancient times, our ancestors began studying the movement of the stars to 
be able to forecast the best time to plan activities, like 
planting seeds or collecting food for when winter came. 
Now we live in an era in which technology advances 
exponentially, and we can study our environment with 
much greater precision. All this technology, though, 
hasn’t necessarily helped us deal with some of the mis-fortunate events in life, such as getting your heart bro-ken, losing your favorite thing, the death of a pet or procrastination.  
The human brain is a spectacular and precise ma-
chine — a computer of sorts. It is able to process chem-ical stimuli, learn, decode and retain information. It also runs a code to make us who we are. The code is 
encrypted in a language complicated enough to evade 
logic when necessary; the language is also meaningful enough to give us a sense of purpose.
This is also known as emotion. We see a level of 
emotionality throughout the animal kingdom, but ours seems to be the most complex. Is it because we have our internal logic constantly work-ing around, and sometimes at odds with, our 
emotions?
In our lives, we are going to encounter 
problems and situations that will interfere 
with our logic and reasoning. Some of us will 
try to control them or fight them, and some 
of us will try to embrace the situations only with our emotions. Is there any healthy bal-ance?
In chemistry, the golden rule will always be equiva-
lent exchange. You will receive the same output you put into the system. This law can be applied in many ways to our lives. For example, the way you treat your friends is likely the way you will be treated back. We 
could also use this law to our advantage in dealing with 
out-of-the-ordinary situations.
By understanding this rule, you can learn how to 
control your brain and your anxiety.
If you set a small goal you are able to achieve every 
day and then slowly increase the amount of input re-quired, you will find yourself gaining more self-confi-dence, bigger rewards, a sense of balance and comfort. For example, if you have problems staying interested 
in a class, try to pay full attention during 50 minutes 
and then reward yourself by doing something you re-ally enjoy afterward. If you are dealing with an emo-tional situation, set daily goals to take you out of that mental state.
Your brain is yours. Get yourself to progress by fill-
ing your brain with new ideas. Learn to master your emotionality by slowly challenging and rewarding yourself. Learn to dissociate from the outside and re-
side on the inside.

“Get yourself to progress by 
illing your brain with 
new ideas.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2016   ALLIGATOR   7 
As a college student, I have to say, 
one of the most intriguing behaviors I have noticed among my comrades is their rather libertarian philoso-phy. By libertarian, I mean specifi-
cally the social ethos that preaches, “If it feels good, do it.” I am curious: Where did this philosophy come from? I think past genera-tions bullied people who lived by the creed we hold dear; in fact, they created a name for them: hippies. And what were the hippies but a group of cultural rebels, openly revolting against the conservative Christian traditions and norms of their parents with a jovial he-donism? It seems, then, our most cherished philosophy blossomed from the seeds of re-bellion. What can account for this pattern?
Martin Luther once equated human na-
ture to being like a drunken peasant trying to sit straight on a horse. The peasant slumps over from side to side, unable to keep a fixed position; as soon as he falls on one side of the horse, someone sets him upright only to see him fall on the other side. In the illustration, we are the drunken peasant, eas-
ily slipping from one extreme be-
havior to the other, one extreme philosophy to the other, never 
able to maintain a steady course 
between the two. Once we slip 
into a harmful behavior or habit, 
we overcompensate in our correc-tion and fall into another harmful 
pattern of behavior, just as the 
peasant seesaws from one side of the horse 
to the other.
I find this insight to be truly illuminating 
in trying to understand how our laissez-faire 
social ethics originated. If all of human his-tory is like a Newton’s cradle, then it makes 
sense to think this current libertarianism is 
a reaction to the previous fascism. I do not 
mean political fascism, but social and sexual 
fascism: the kind that forbids more forms of entertainment and leisure than it accepts. I 
use the term “fascism” loosely. It makes 
sense to think a child who was scolded and 
punished for immorality would, in turn, be a much more affirming and accepting 
parent, if only to spare his or her 
own child from the trauma he or she once endured.
It certainly is the case that cur-
rent behavioral and ethical norms 
are radically different from less 
than a hundred years ago. For mil-lennials today, the Protestant ethic 
has become just that: an ethic 
for Protestants. Today we say, “Do as you 
please,” whereas yesterday we said, “Don’t 
as you please.” A good deal of baby boom-
ers loathed the paralyzing restrictions of their 
parents, and so they removed all restrictions for their children. And as Luther said, the 
peasant flops from one side of his horse to 
another.
Is this pattern beneficial, harmful, good or 
bad? Let’s just say I have my reservations. As a Christian, I am skeptical of the present 
mood. By affirming what our parents and 
grandparents would have condemned, we 
are — by definition — deconstructing what they built. Whether we are right in disman-
tling what they championed is another dis-
cussion, but this process will certainly pro-duce serious consequences.
Never before has a culture focused so 
intensely on the rights of individuals to es-
sentially do whatever they please with 
whomever they please at whatever age or with whatever consequence. We go to great 
lengths to point out our parents’ and grand-
parents’ flaws. They had many, as we all do, 
but at least they had more to live for than 
simply one’s own pleasure. They believed in 
God, the sacredness of a marriage and the 
primacy of the nation.
We might scoff at the faults of our ances-
tors, but what do we have to offer? “If it feels good, do it?” What type of deep, meaningful 
and satisfying cultural creed is that? Maybe 
we’ve taken Luther’s illustration a little too seriously — the drunken part, that is.

Last Spring, I was crushing on a be-
spectacled girl with green hair in my European literature class. I asked her 
out on a Wednesday, and she told me 
she had a boyfriend. I felt terribly sor-
ry for myself the rest of the day. I got home and furiously moped to The Smiths in my 
bedroom for several hours. Then I moved 
to scribbling short stanzas of melodramatic verse, like: “Your hair is greener than the grass I want to lie in with you while we f---.”
Soon I found myself on the living-room 
couch, nursing a bottle of cheap red wine like some sort of consolation prize. It was midnight, and I had drank two-thirds of the 
sickly-sweet pinot noir when I decided to 
text my ex-girlfriend. She and I broke up in October. Or rather, I ghosted her. I’m not proud of this, but it’s what happened. We had been having unprotected sex and 
sleepovers consistently for a month when 
I stopped answering her texts. I left what we had for some reason I can’t quite place; maybe it was be-cause her veganism made going 
out for food difficult, or maybe 
I was intimidated by her occa-sional use of hard drugs. Maybe I wasn’t ready to commit, or may-
be I just wasn’t ready to commit 
to her. But there I was, months later, feeling lonely and nostalgic for the times we spent together. I pulled out my phone and started typing.
Many of us have been here, drunk on a 
weekday night, writing and rewriting some convoluted message to an ex-lover. Mine went something like this, though with many 
more spelling and grammatical errors: “So 
I know you probably hate my guts, and I don’t expect you to respond, but I wanted to tell you how sorry I am for the way I ended things. You didn’t deserve that. And 
to be honest, I miss you.”
She responded an hour later, after I fin-ished the bottle of wine. “Do you 
want to come over?”
I rode my bike to her place, 
and we drank black coffee and smoked cigarettes on her couch. Her place was furnished with mismatched floral-print couches 
spotted with gray lint and burn 
marks. There was a small black milk crate between the couches in 
place of a coffee table. We talked for hours, and I stumbled through a long-winded apol-
ogy. She called me an a--hole but forgave 
me. Eventually, I asked to see her room, and as we sat side by side on her twin-sized futon, I leaned in to kiss her. Making out, I 
ran my fingers through her short, soft hair.
Then we had sex. Without going into too 
much detail, I will say it was really enjoy-
able. It felt familiar and comfortable, yet somehow fresh, like sleeping in your bed for 
the first time after a long trip. And though 
this bed was an unreasonably firm couch-mattress, I still felt good, honest, pure.
And I think that’s the thing about hav-
ing sex with an ex. You know what they 
like, and they know what you like. Plus, 
there’s no awkward tension of a first-time sexual encounter. It’s falling back into an easy routine, even if was only a one-time 
thing. You see, I tried to contact her about a 
week later, to see her again, but she didn’t respond.
Still, I feel like maybe that’s the point 
of hooking up with an ex. It’s a quick way 
to lift one’s spirits: It’s a good, passion-
ate, friendly and romantic sex session with someone you know well. Then, you can go right back to being broken up. After all, you 
probably broke up for some good reason in 
the first place.  
And maybe it was fitting she ignored me 
the same way I ignored her months before. I’m not bitter, just thinking.

He said being able to participate 
was a milestone for him. 
“I’ve been an active member of

now,” he said. “It’s good to be able 
to vote for the ﬁ  rst time.”
Dillon Boatner, a poll worker at 
the Reitz Union, said while the turn-
out was lower than in the March 
primary, more people came than in 
the previous two fall primary elec-tions. Almost an hour before polls closed, about 70 people had voted, 
compared to 32 people in 2012 and 34 people in 2008, he said.  
“Somehow they doubled,” the 
19-year-old political science sopho-
more said. “I’m not sure what in-clined more people to come out.”
Boatner said the biggest issues 
with turnout at the on-campus loca-tion came down to people forgetting to update their registrations after moving from their hometowns or moving off campus. 
He said the university could push 
for a higher turnout from students. 
“A lot more can be done to pro-
mote elections and promote voter registration, especially from the uni-versity’s end,” Boatner said.ELECTION,  from pg. 1About 41,360 people voted

"Honestly, it's like the president walking in. Everyone shuts up."
— Florida receiver Ahmad Fulwood on quarterback 
Luke Del Rio walking into the huddleCoach Paul Spangler and the Florida cross country team are excited by the amount of young talent on the roster.Read the story on pg.14.Let me start by saying Tim Tebow was one hell of an athlete. 
One of the greatest 
to ever step foot on 
Florida’s campus and play 
college football. 
But no, Tim, you cannot 
play professional baseball. 
For those scratching 
their heads after reading 
that last sentence, Tebow showcased his baseball abilities in front of scouts from more than 20 Major League organizations 
Tuesday in a workout at the 
University of Southern California.He put on a 
show, too. 
Tebow  
blasted balls over 400 feet in 
batting practice 
and ran a better-than-average 6.65 60-yard dash, as reported by 
MLB.com’s Jon Morosi. 
All while ﬂ  ashing off a hulk-
like physique he’s somehow 
maintained. 
But think about how ludicrous 
it sounds: A 29-year-old washed-up football player who hasn’t 
played baseball since his junior year of high school is attempting to play professional baseball.
I’m not buying it. 
Sure, Tebow might’ve been 
considered a great baseball 
player at Nease High School in Ponte Vedra, where he hit .494 with four home runs his junior year before enrolling at UF early.
But so were thousands of 
other players that never panned out.

a few homers my junior year of By Jordan McPherson

UF defensive back Duke 
Dawson takes pride in his 
versatility.Line him up as an outside 
corner, and he said he’ll keep up with the receiver.
Put him in as the nickel corner, 
and he’ll jam the slot receiver at the line.Send him deep as a safety, and 
he’ll be a ballhawk and cover ground.
“I can play it all,” said Dawson, 
a junior. “It’s no big deal to me. It’s just all preparation.”The Gators plan to primarily 
use Dawson at nickel, hoping he’ll fill the void left by the NFL-bound Brian Poole.
But with All-Southeastern 
Conference corner Jalen Tabor suspended for Saturday’s season opener against UMass, Dawson will have a chance to showcase 
his versatility right away. The 
5-foot-10, 208-pound defender is listed on the Gators’ depth chart as the first-team starter for both outside corner and nickel this 
week.
“Duke really has upped a lot 
of the things,” UF coach Jim 
McElwain said last week. “His 
ability obviously, the flexibility to 
play some nickel, but more than that be effective at the corner is something he’s shown.”
But over his first two years, 
Dawson has not had a bevy of opportunities to make plays on the field.
A four-star recruit out of 
Cross City’s Dixie County High, Dawson spent most of his first two years as a backup, rolling in on certain packages or coming in for the occasional play whenever 
starters needed a breather. He 
took a back seat to the likes of Vernon Hargreaves, Keanu Neal and Poole — all in the NFL now 
— as well as classmates Tabor 
and Quincy Wilson.
In 25 games (just one start at 
safety) over his first two seasons, Dawson recorded 24 career 
tackles, two defended passes and 
a forced fumble. 
His lone interception came 
in his collegiate debut against 
Eastern Michigan in 2014. He 
returned the pick 36 yards for a WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2016

GATORS IN THE NFL

Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to 
stand during the anthem overshad-owed an even more surprising narra-tive on the 49ers’ sideline this week: The re-emergence of Jeff Driskel. In addition, former Florida receivers, defensive rookies and veterans came through for their teams in Week 3 of the NFL preseason. 
Driskel — a former Florida quarterback who 
transferred to Louisiana Tech — captured sig-niﬁ  cant playing time in Friday’s loss to the Green Bay Packers. Driskel came in 
to start the second half and threw for 43 yards on 4 of 8 attempts for San Francisco. He also rushed for 17 yards on two attempts and was Former UF receivers score

Last year, the Florida women’s 
and men’s cross country teams 
dominated the competition to 
open the season at the Covered 
Bridge Open, ﬁ  nishing ﬁ  rst and second, respectively.
This year, the Gators will look 
for a repeat performance when they compete at the Covered Bridge in Boone, North Carolina, again on Sept. 2.
However, many of the runners 
who saw success at last year’s meet — such as Maria Larsen (who ﬁ  nished second), Eddie Garcia (fourth) and Jimmy Clark 
(ﬁ  fth) — aren’t returning, either 
graduating or leaving for other circumstances.While that may be concerning 
for other teams, coach Paul Span-
gler is conﬁ  dent that Florida will 
continue its success.
Spangler’s excitement comes 
partially from UF’s 12 new run-
ners, who all bring new elements 
to the team. 
On Monday, UF’s coach spoke 
highly of many Florida freshmen, including Hannah Brookover, 
who was the ﬁ  rst cross coun-
try state champion from Pinellas County since 2000.
“She’s looked really good in 
practice. I’m very happy where she’s at right now, certainly be-ing a talented athlete out of high school with multiple state cham-pionships out of Florida,” Span-
gler said. 
“She’s an extremely hard worker, and I’m very impressed 
with what I’ve seen from her 
these past few weeks.”
And that’s just one of the re-
cruits.
Jessica Pascoe, who won the 
2016 Australian Jr. Champion-
ship, and Marshall Dillon, who has high school regional and district championships under his belt, are also highly coveted ﬁ  rst-
year athletes.
Part of their development 
will come from the competition 
and experience they will gain 
throughout the season, but other 
forms of improvement will come from watching and learning from UF’s established veterans.
“We got guys who can step 
into that leadership role,” Span-gler said. “Like Carlos Miranda, Mac 
Reynolds, also being a senior, 
they have a chance stepping into 
that role.”
On the women’s team, the 
Gators have an experienced run-
ner in Taylor Tubbs, who ﬁ  nished 
ﬁ  fth at the Covered Bridge and 26th in the NCAA South Regional Championships last season.
“With a large and very talent-
ed freshman class, she is gonna be called upon to step up,” Span-gler said of the senior. 
“Not only out on the course in 
terms of performance, but also in the locker room and helping lead these freshmen.”
And while Miranda, Reynolds 
and Tubbs all had top-15 ﬁ  nishes 
at the Covered Bridge Open in 
2015, UF’s coach said he’s not solely going to rely on the seniors to provide leadership.
“Some of our guys that were 
freshmen last year, that are up-perclassmen, like Seamus Love 
and Jack Guyton,” Spangler said.
“Those are two guys that have 
shown leadership qualities in the 
past.”
The same can be said for soph-
omore Elisabeth Bergh, who ﬁ  n-ished ninth last year at the Cov-ered Bridge and competed in six races for the Gators.
“The core of the group is back, 
and we added an excellent re-cruiting class,” Spangler said. “I’m excited from what I’ve seen 
in practice so far.”

high school. Stats don’t mean 
squat a decade later.
Tebow’s disciples will say he’s 
a gifted athlete and he just needs time.
“But look how far he can hit 
a baseball! Look how strong and fast he is!” they might say. 
Baseball is a sport that requires 
years and years of dedication. 
Pitchers don’t simply pick up a baseball for the first time and throw 95 mph. 
They can’t locate an arsenal of 
pitches without the hundreds of bullpens spent beforehand. 
Ask Greg Maddux.In the same way, you can’t 
expect a hitter who hasn’t seen consistent live pitching in 10 years to step into the box against a pro and adjust to a slider or a changeup or any other offspeed pitch. 
And I’m not expecting Tebow to either. 
But let’s set his skills on the 
diamond aside for a minute. 
From an economic standpoint, 
signing Tebow would likely be the 
perfect way to fill the near-empty 
stands in some podunk town’s minor league stadium. 
Fans would undoubtedly 
flock to see Tebow hit below the Mendoza line. 
The club makes money. Tebow gets his shot. Everybody wins, right?Wrong. Signing someone as raw as 
Tebow at this point of his life is essentially a slap in the face to the thousands of other players 
— out of college, high school or 
anywhere else — who deserve a chance in the minors. 
Even established MLB players 
feel that way. 
Baltimore Orioles’ All-Star 
outfielder Adam Jones mocked Tebow in a Tweet earlier this month: “After this MLB season I’m going try out for the NFL this offseason. I haven’t played since HS but I’ve played in a few TurkeyBowls since!!”
For the sake of everyone, 
hang up the cleats and stick to analyzing football games. 
Stop trying to stay relevant. And most of all, don’t quit 
your day job, Tim.

touchdown.
“I’m gonna take that game by game, day by day, 
practice by practice,” Dawson said. “You’ve got to 
come out every day and work.”
And according to his teammates, he’s put in the 
work.
Redshirt senior Marcus Maye, who has worked 
with Dawson over the last two years, said Dawson’s 
versatility is only a benefit for the Gators’ defense, a group that finished 13th in the country last year in passing defense by surrendering an average of just 182.1 yards through the air over 14 games.
“He can run. He can cover. He can tackle. You can 
put him in the slot. You can put him out wide at corner. He can do a lot of different things,” Maye said. “So just knowing that he’s out there on the field, we’re all 
excited to see him play.”
Come Saturday, Dawson will have his chance to 
play.
And to Dawson, where he’s lined up won’t matter. 
“It’s just playing ball,” he said.

Philadelphia Eagles kicker Caleb Sturgis (6) boots a field goal off the hold of punter Donnie Jones (8) during the first half of an NFL preseason football game against the Indianapolis Colts in Indianapolis on Aug. 27, 2016.
sacked once for an eight-yard loss. 
Driskel probably wished he had his old 
teammate Trey Burton running routes for him on Friday. In a matchup against the Colts over the weekend, Philadelphia’s Burton caught a team-high five passes for 35 yards and a touchdown. Eagles QB Sam Bradford found Burton on a third-and-goal play that left the tight end open on the left flat for an easy 3-yard touchdown reception. 
Burton wasn’t the only Gator tight end 
to find the endzone in preseason Week 3. Redskins star Jordan Reed hooked up with Washington QB Kirk Cousins for a 20-yard touchdown pass Friday night. Reed finished with two catches for 28 total yards. 
In the same game, former Gator Quinton 
Dunbar recovered a fumble for Washington from his cornerback position. 
Chiefs receiver Frankie Hammond also 
caught attention over the weekend. The un-drafted veteran caught three passes on three targets for 50 yards in a Saturday win over the Bears. 
Despite the Bears’ loss, Chicago’s Jona-
than Bullard had a big day. The rookie totaled three solo tackles with two tackles for a loss and a sack on Chiefs’ backup Aaron Murray. 
Bullard was one of three Florida rookies to 
have an impact in Week 3. Former secondary tandem Vernon Harg-
reaves and Keanu Neal both showed up for their new NFC South employers. 
Hargreaves had two solo tackles in the 
Bucs’ rout of the Browns, and Neal racked up five solo tackles with one being a tackle for a loss. Unfortunately for the Falcons’ new safety, Neal injured his knee after missing a tackle on Miami’s Arian Foster and is expect-ed to sit out three to four weeks. 
While Florida’s defensive rookies played 
well over the weekend, Florida’s defensive veterans on the Vikings put on a show. In a 23-10 win over the Chargers, defensive end Justin Trattou made five solo tackles, in-cluding a tackle for loss and two sacks. Fel-low defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd tacked on another two tackles during the Sunday matchup. 
In special teams news, Florida fans in 
Philadelphia were reminded of what it’s like to have a reliable kicker. Caleb Sturgis went two for two in a win over the Colts Saturday, knocking home field goals from 32 and 47 yards out. 
Florida fans will be able to watch Harg-
reaves and the Bucs try to cover Reed and his Redskins in a rescheduled Week 4 game tonight at 8 p.m.

HERE COMES THE BOONE
The NFL regular season is almost here.
And with it comes yet another 
fresh set of controversies. 
In my opinion, however, none 
sticks out more than San Francisco 
49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s deci-
sion to sit during the national anthem.
By now, everyone’s heard the news.Before the start of Week 3’s preseason 
game between San Francisco and Green Bay, the 49ers’ 28-year-old signal caller re-fused to stand during the national anthem, 
igniting a ﬁ  re across social media and the 
public alike.
“I’m not going to stand up to show pride in a ﬂ  ag for a country that op-presses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL.
com.
Kaepernick, who was born 
in Milwaukee but grew up in 
Turlock, California, has always 
been a staunch supporter of civ-
il rights and equality, using his celebrity status as a football star to shed light on important social issues that cloud this country. 
“To me, this is bigger than football,” 
Kaepernick said of his decision, according to ESPN.com.To a certain extent, he is 
right.
The issues that we as a coun-
try have to deal with are much bigger than a game — a game that Kaepernick makes millions of dollars a year off of, I might 
add.   
But this was never about 
football to begin with. 
The national anthem and the 
ﬂ  ag of the United States of America have nothing to do with football.
And although the system is ﬂ  awed, the 
ﬂ  ag, in my opinion, is not.It doesn’t represent racism, it doesn’t 
represent oppression and it doesn’t repre-sent inequality.
Rather, it represents every ideal that this 
country is supposed to embody: freedom, 
equality and opportunity — everything that 
Kaepernick says he stands for.
Don’t get me wrong, Kaepernick has ev-
ery right not to stand for the national an-
them. There is no law-of-the-land or NFL requirement that says otherwise.
It’s a personal choice.But you should choose to show respect.Take Usain Bolt, for example.During the 2012 London Olympics, the 
Jamaican runner cut an interview short in order to pay respects to the U.S. national anthem that was being played before an-other event. 
If someone who is not even from this 
country can show respect to its ﬂ  ag, why can’t Kaepernick?
Countless men and women have shed 
their blood for the ideals this country is 
supposed to be founded on. Ideals that Old 
Glory still represents.
Yes, this country is on a wayward path 
and doesn’t always represent the ideals that it’s supposed to.
And yes, this country needs change.But for that change to happen, it needs 
individuals who are willing to take a stand — not a seat.
I don’t necessarily doubt your intentions, 
Kap.
It’s the method.Show some respect. Take a stand now, because there’s a 
good chance you’re going to be sitting a lot this season.
On the bench.
