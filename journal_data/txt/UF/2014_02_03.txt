PEDRO BRAVO CASE

Pedro Bravo’s trial, which has 
been delayed multiple times, has 
ﬁ  nally gained some certainty.
The trial of the 20-year-old for-
mer Santa Fe College student will begin Aug. 4, said State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Darry Lloyd. 
Bravo is accused of murdering 
UF freshman Christian Aguilar in 2012.
Lloyd said he expects it could 
last about two weeks. Pretrial hearings will be held July 16.
He said the judge set the Au-
gust date to make sure all parties will be prepared.
At the most 
recent case man-agement hear-ing on Jan. 14, 
Bravo’s defense 
attorney, Mi-chael Ruppert, said the legal team was still collecting deposi-
tions and wasn’t ready to present 
in court. 
More than 100 witnesses have 
been interviewed for the case, ac-
cording to Alligator archives.
Bravo’s charges include homi-
cide, kidnapping, lying to police, 
mishandling human remains, pro-viding false reports, tampering 
with physical evidence and poi-
soning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person, according to court records.
He was arrested in September 
2012, four days after Aguilar was reported missing, and he remains at the Alachua County Jail. Following delays, murder trial set for August

Pre-medical students now have access to 
later MCAT testing dates, but UF students 
are still advised to take the test as soon as possible.
The Association of American Medical 
Colleges, which creates the exam, added testing dates in October and November  2014 and in January 2015. Previously, test-ing dates only extended into September.
Owen Farcy, director of MCAT 2015 
programs for Kaplan Test Prep, said the AAMC added extra testing dates in antici-pation of a large inﬂ  ux of students rushing to take the test before the new MCAT rolls 
out in Spring 2015.
However, Leila Amiri, the director of ad-
missions for UF’s College of Medicine, said 
students should remember taking the test at a later date could mean a lower chance of being accepted.
“I think it’s always great to have op-
tions,” she said. “But taking the test at a later date isn’t necessarily a good thing.”
Amiri said the November test results 
will reach UF by December, which is too More MCAT 
dates open

Justin Timberlake could be bringing his 
suit and tie all the way to UF next month 
— if  the Men’s Basketball Rowdies have its way.
The group announced plans Friday to 
invite Timberlake to come to UF to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the basket-ball game against the Kentucky Wildcats on March 8.The Rowdies have chosen to use the col-
lective power of UF students’ social media to entice the singer to the Swamp.
They are asking students to use Face-
book, Instagram, Twitter and other social media sites to spread the word about the 
campaign.
Some prominent social media pages, in-
cluding ofﬁ  cial UF accounts, have expressed 
their support of the movement.  
Lucas Dolengowski, president of the 
Rowdies and a 21-year-old UF telecommu-nication junior, said he wants this event to be as much fun as possible. 
Some of the ideas he 
suggested were student-submitted pictures and 
videos at memorable cam-pus locations with reasons why students love Tim-
berlake. 
The idea originally came from the Uni-
versity Athletic Association, Dolengowski said. But the UAA wanted the campaign to be run by students.
“We really want to increase the Florida 
brand, really get our name out there more than it already is,” he said. “You can never have too much of a presence.”
The nationally televised game against 
Kentucky also falls on Senior Day, when UF will be honoring the four seniors on the bas-ketball team. Dolengowski said that’s what

Krishna Lunch has launched a feature on 
its Facebook page called Humans of Krishna 
Lunch as a part of its campaign to fund the Plaza of the Americas renovations.
The posts include pictures of people eating 
with quotes about their experience. Photogra-pher and Krishna Lunch employee Amy Hol-lis said the project aims to connect members.
“We wanted to collect stories not just for the fundraising campaign but to help the Krishna Lunch community grow,” she said.  “These Krishna Lunchers are all individuals 
all doing the same thing every day but don’t 
really know each other.”
The Krishna Lunch Forever campaign is 
collaborating with the UF Foundation to help raise money for the renovations on the Plaza of the Americas, which will include new seat-ing areas and tables. The Krishna campaign has already raised about $45,000, said Bob Co-hen, the campaign’s director.“Most of the money will be spent on in-
frastructure underneath, so groundwater will drain and grass and trees will grow to be 
greener,” Cohen said.
UF senior philanthropic adviser Carter 
Boydstun estimates plaza renovations to cost 
about $1.6 million. The UF Foundation has $300,000 in commitments from alumni toward funding the upgrades.
“The sooner we have the revitalization 
completed, the faster students will be able to 
benefit from it,” he said.Boydstun said because of UF’s longstand-
ing affiliation with Krishna Lunch, working 
with them was an easy choice.
Along with raising money, part of the cam-
paign and project is to get more students to come out to Krishna Lunch. 
Worker Hladini Lorence, 18, said Humans 
of Krishna Lunch will make the event more personable.
“Usually the pictures get around 10 to 20 
likes,” she said. “It gives everyone a chance to get to know Krishna Lunchers.”Humans of Krishna Lunch project funds renovations, unites eatersBrittany Willis / Alligator

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — Philip Sey-
mour Hoffman, who won the 
Oscar for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote and created a gallery of slackers, charlatans 
and other characters so vivid that 
he was regarded as one of the world’s finest actors, was found dead in his apartment Sunday with what officials said was a needle in his arm. He was 46.
The actor apparently died of 
a drug overdose, said two law enforcement officials, who spoke 
to the Associated Press on condi-
tion of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case. Envelopes containing what was believed to be heroin were found with him, they said.
The stage-trained actor’s rum-
pled naturalism brought him four Academy Award nominations 
— for “Capote,” ‘’The Master,” 
‘’Doubt” and “Charlie Wilson’s War” — and three Tony nomina-tions for his work on Broadway, including his portrayal of the beaten and weary Willy Loman in “Death of a Salesman.”
Hoffman spoke candidly over the years about his struggles with drug addiction. After 23 years sober, he admitted in interviews last year to falling off the wagon and developing a heroin problem 
that led to a stint in rehab.
“No words for this. He was 
too great, and we’re too shat-
tered,” said Mike Nichols, who directed Hoffman in “Charlie Wilson’s War” and “Death of a Salesman.”
The law enforcement officials 
said Hoffman’s body was discov-
ered in a bathroom in his Green-
wich Village apartment by his assistant and a friend who made the 911 call.
For much of the day, a police 
crime-scene van was parked out front, and technicians carrying brown paper bags went in and out. Police kept a growing crowd 
of onlookers back. A single red 
daisy had been placed in front of the lobby door.
On Sunday night, a black 
body bag was carried out on a stretcher, loaded into the back of a medical examiner’s van and driven away.
Hoffman’s family called the 
news “tragic and sudden.” Hoff-man is survived by his partner of 15 years, Mimi O’Donnell, and their three children.
“We are devastated by the 
loss of our beloved Phil and ap-preciate the outpouring of love and support we have received from everyone,” the family said in a statement.
Tributes poured in from Hol-
lywood figures.
“Damn, We Lost Another 
Great Artist,” Spike Lee, who di-rected him in “25th Hour,” said on Twitter.
Kevin Costner said in an AP 
interview: “Philip was a very im-portant actor and really takes his place among the real great actors. It’s a shame. Who knows what he 
would have been able to do? But 
we’re left with the legacy of the work he’s done, and it all speaks for itself.”
Hoffman was as productive 
as he was acclaimed, often ap-pearing in at least two or three films a year while managing a busy life in the theater.
He played comic, slightly 
off-kilter characters in movies like “Along Came Polly,” ‘’The Big Lebowski” and “Almost Fa-mous.” And in “Moneyball,” he was Art Howe, the grumpy man-ager of the Oakland A’s who re-sisted new thinking about base-ball talent.
Many younger moviegoers 
know him as Plutarch Heavens-bee. He was reprising that role in the two-part sequel, “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay,” for which his work was mostly completed.

Local business owners are upset after 
hearing rumors that Starbucks may go in-side the Union Street Station building in downtown Gainesville. The major coffee company was to establish four locations in Gainesville by 2000, which had local coffee shop owners questioning if they could compete. “I’m hoping, obviously, that (Starbucks) is not going to affect us badly, but if it does, it does,” said Linda Wrighton, owner of Maude’s Classic Cafe. However, some UF students were excited about the rumors. History major Peter Focks said if one were to be built on UF’s campus he would frequently visit it.
Feb. 3, 2009The Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority house 
saw more than $11,000 worth of dam-age after a window air conditioner unit caught fire in a second-floor bedroom. However, only $1,500 worth of damage was a result of the fire, according to Al-ligator archives. The remaining dam-age was caused by the sprinkler system, which drenched the inside of the house. Sorority sisters were able to go back in the house and gather their belongings after Gainesville Fire Rescue made sure the fire was extinguished. Sisters spent the next couple nights in the Reitz Union, neighboring sorority houses and friends’ houses.
Feb. 3, 2000UF officials met with a University of 
California, Berkeley, administrator to talk about admission essays on applica-tions for the university. A presentation from Bob Laird, the former director of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, outlined California’s experiences with the essays. Laird said California’s uni-versity system put the measure in place to prevent the discrimination on the basis on race, sex and color. However, Berkeley saw admission rates for minorities drop 9 percentage points. According to Alligator archives, UF and FSU would require es-says for prospective students by Summer of 2001. Then-UF financial aid director Karen Fooks said she was impressed with the results she had seen with the essays. “I do think they give a more holistic pic-ture of the student, certainly more than just a quantitative analysis of GPA and test score,” she wrote in an email.

A masked man burst through the 
door, shielding himself from gunfire 
as he snatched the girl closest to him 
and made his escape. The FBI Art 
Crime Unit now had to deal with not only five missing paintings but also a missing director.
This diplomatic crisis was part of 
the 11th annual Gator Model U.N. 
conference this weekend. UF’s cam-
pus was filled with young aspiring diplomats from Mississippi, Georgia and Florida for the largest student-
run high school conference in the 
Southeastern United States.
About 450 high school students 
came to the three-day conference hosted by the UF Model U.N. club 
and were tasked with solving dip-
lomatic issues in either assembly or crisis committees.
“Assembly committees run ex-
actly the way the real United Na-tions works. There’s a set topic; they debate resolutions,” said Aaron Kalafarski, a 21-year-old UF politi-cal science junior who directed the conference as Secretariat-General. 
“Crisis committee is more like a 
story. They are main characters, and they play a huge part in creating the story.”

Chiles High School, donned a long black beard and brown robe to play Rasputin in the League of Extraordi-nary Gentlemen, a crisis committee

“I chose Rasputin because being 
a psychopath is so much fun to play. He has the most fiction and the few-
est facts so you can bend the rules,” 
said Koberda, 16, who used his pow-ers to create a storm that wiped out fleets trying to invade Russia. 
In addition to the 21 committees, 
the conference hosted one of the Lost Boys of Sudan, Jacob Atem, and raised money for his charity.
“Gator MUN is one of the most 
professional conferences, it’s the best thought-out and one of the most cre-ative,” Koberda said. “They’re not afraid to push the rules.”UF hosts high school students for Gator Model UN conferenceLOCAL

Westside Samaritans Clinic has 
expanded its services and opened 
a new location in Gainesville.
The expansion, dubbed Sa-
maritans Healthcare, is the result of a partnership with Gainesville OBGYN in an effort to bring ob-
stetric services for Medicaid and 
uninsured expectant mothers, said physician and clinic director Dr. Roy Klossner.
The long-term objective is to 
move general services over to the new building, located at 1201 SW 164th Terrace, behind North Flor-ida Regional Medical Center.  
“The goal ultimately is to 
… offer full-spectrum primary care,” Klossner said. “They call it ‘from womb to tomb.’”
The original clinic, based out 
of Westside Baptist Church, of-fers primary, dental and behav-
ioral health care as well as eye 
exams and free glasses, Klossner said. 
The services are open to pa-
tients who don’t have insurance, 
have incomes at a certain federal 
poverty level or qualify under state guidelines.
“For now we want to keep 
both locations open because we see a different kind of clientele,” Klossner said.
Director of operations Brenda 
Belote said the clinic sees patients Thursdays from 5 to 8 p.m., but space is limited.
“You may have a Bible study class in here on Sunday morn-
ing,” she said. “Then on Thurs-
day night, you have an exam room.”
Before the new health care 
center can expand its services, 
Belote said the clinic needs to 
write grants. It also needs to find a full-time family practice doctor and support staff, which could 
take a couple years.
“Right now we’re just taking 
baby steps toward expanding 
this,” she said, “but we will still be here on Thursday evening.”
Kelley Rojas, a 20-year-old UF 
biology graduate and volunteer coordinator at the clinic, said she doesn’t believe the expansion will 
hinder service at the clinic.
“There’s actually people em-
ployed, and there’s a staff, so I 
don’t think it will really affect us,” said Rojas. “Plus, we have a 
lot of volunteers that come.”Women’s clinic opening new location

Waldo Police arrested a 
Gainesville woman Saturday 
after police said she hid crack cocaine in her panties at a traf-fic stop.
Officers arrested 27-year-old 
Tracy Lynn Irvin on charges of possession and intent to deliver a controlled substance, accord-ing to the report.
At about 4:45 p.m., an offi-
cer saw a car run a stop signal then speed four miles over the speed limit on Northeast U.S. 
Highway 301, according to the 
report.
The officer pulled over the 
car, driven by Irvin. He saw what he i d e n t i f i e d as crack co-
caine on the driver’s seat and some sticking to 
the front of 
Irvin’s jeans. During ques-
tioning, Irvin told the officer she hid the drug in her underwear when she realized she was be-ing pulled over.
Irvin told officers she was 
doing someone a favor by deliv-
ering it, according to the report.
Officers booked Irvin into the Alachua County Jail at about 6 p.m., where she remained as of press time.Police: Woman hid

TIMBERLAKE , from page 1Some students are hopefulThe new test will be twice as long
late for applicants to schedule a Fall interview.
She said the college holds interviews 
throughout Fall and Spring, but it begins se-
lecting students by mid-October. By the time students get their results in for a Spring inter-view, there will be fewer available spots, and 
the applicant pool will be much larger and 
more selective.
Farcy said the AAMC announced in 2011 it 
would be changing the test. The last time the test had a major content overhaul was in 1991, with a minor change in 2007.
“The way we practice medicine in the U.S. 
has drastically changed since the 1990s,” he said. “So the exam was due for a change.”He said the new MCAT will have an addi-
tional three semesters of extra content in bio-chemistry, sociology and psychology. The new test will also be roughly twice as long, running at six hours and 15 minutes.
The AAMC will release one practice exam 
before the test’s release, he said. Kaplan will also have practice materials available to stu-dents on its website.
Atilio Atencio, a 19-year-old UF biochemis-
try sophomore, said because he needs to take physics in the Fall, the later testing dates will allow him to get through most of the course’s content before he takes the MCAT.
Atencio said he also wants to take the test 
before the additional three hours of testing time go into affect. MCAT , from page 1“For now we want to

TALLAHASSEE — The Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement 
announced Saturday it is inves-
tigating 2,600 cases handled by a Pensacola-based agency chemist after discovering dozens of in-
stances where prescription pain 
pills that were seized by police and 
tested as evidence were swapped with over-the-counter pills. 
FDLE Commissioner Gerald 
Bailey said the chemist handled cases involving 80 law enforcement 
agencies from 35 counties since he 
was hired in 2006. Most, but not 
all, of the cases involved testing 
drug evidence, though it was not immediately clear how many cases

Down a luminary-lit path 
in Paynes Prairie Satur-
day night, the Alachua As-
tronomy Club set up high-
powered telescopes to show guests whichever constella-tion, nebula or planet they 
wanted to see.
More than 200 Gainesville 
residents gathered at the 
ninth annual stargazing event organized by the Friends of 
Paynes Prairie, a public char-
ity group that raises money for the park.
Perran Ross, the group’s 
president, said the proﬁ  ts from the $5 entry fee directly beneﬁ  t the park.
“We raise funds through 
events like this one and nu-
merous other activities,” he 
said, “and we disburse those funds back to the prairie to help them with things like 
resource management facili-
ties.”
Despite cloudy weather, 
participants found ways to enjoy the evening, which in-
cluded live music, a bonﬁ  re 
and a hayride through the park.  
Gainesville resident Justin Telle, 10, listed all the things he liked about the event.
“It was really cool. I liked 
the hayride and the camp with the horses,” he said. “I liked the music and the tele-scopes where you get to see 
Jupiter and the four moons. 
The hot chocolate and s’mores were really good.”
Matt Bledsoe, a Paynes 
Prairie assistant park man-ager, said the event beneﬁ  ts not only beneﬁ  ts the park 
but also the community. It 
provides an avenue to fund-raise for the park and edu-cate those who attend. 
Whether participants 
learned from the astronomy 
club or took a hayride to 
learn about park history, “it’s a good partnership (among) the astronomy club, 
the Friends of Paynes Prairie 
and the park,” Bledsoe said.      Astronomers unite:

Pia Leinonen and Joni Tiala are making 
their way from New York City south to the 
Florida Keys and east to California, driving about 10,000 miles in a rental van. Their dress-ing rooms are frequently campsites.
Leinonen and Tiala make up the Finnish 
folk duo Vellamo, which performed Sunday afternoon at the High Springs Branch Library. An audience of about 50 people sang to the traditional Finnish songs and “It Ain’t Me Babe” by Bob Dylan.
Leinonen, 33, and Tiala, 35, stay for free in 
state parks across the country and trade con-certs for accommodations. They said they are enjoying the beauty of Florida parks and the small, historic towns. 
The songs they performed told of friend-
ship, love troubles and even moonshine.
Vellamo produced two albums of tradition-
al Finnish folk music. Its most recent album, a collection of traditional songs, hasn’t been released in Finland yet, but the High Springs Branch Library has one copy in circulation.
Alicia and Carl Myers, of Trenton, both at-tended the library-sponsored concert. Alicia Myers said they regularly attend library-spon-sored concerts, and Carl Myers said they en-joyed the afternoon because of the folk music inﬂ  uences.
Alicia Myers raised her hand and asked for 
an encore. In response, the band played a loud, bouncy Swedish song followed by applause. 
“This was one of the best concerts,” Leino-
nen said.

of silence punishes 
victims of abuse
When Woody Allen won the Golden Globe lifetime 
achievement award a few weeks ago, an old debate reignited: Is it right to celebrate artists who have com-
mitted — or been accused of committing — heinous crimes?
In the early 1990s, actress Mia Farrow went public with sto-
ries of abuse that he inﬂ  icted on her and his then-children. The most striking were Farrow’s accounts of Allen’s sexual abuse of her then-daughter, Dylan Farrow, who was 7 at the time. Ac-cording to the Washington Post, Allen was never convicted, and his 1992 child molestation charges were ultimately dropped.  
After the media back-and-forth died down following Allen’s 
Golden Globes recognition, Dylan Farrow came forward for the ﬁ  rst time and published an open letter in The New York Times detailing the abuse she suffered. In the letter, she criticized the 
message Hollywood sends victims of abuse at the hands of a 
powerful individual: that powerful abusers are accepted back into the industry while the victims are ignored.  
Allen and Sony Pictures have since denied any wrongdoing 
on the writer and director’s part, according to the Washington Post. Because the statute of limitations on Dylan Farrow’s case ran out at least 15 years ago, as Litchﬁ  eld County state attorney Frank S. Maco told the Post, it’s likely Farrow’s public condem-nation of Allen will eventually fade away. 
It’s an all-too-familiar case in the entertainment — and sport 
and political — arena. While it’s impossible to mention Amanda Bynes, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan or Demi Lovato without someone bringing up their DUIs and mental breakdowns, prom-inent male celebrities often escape the intense scrutiny that’s af-forded to young starlets. Furthermore, the debate about whether art produced by criminals has value is pointless. It’s clear, given our history of convenient forgetfulness, that famous men will continue to be celebrated despite their past transgressions. 
The obvious anomaly is Chris Brown, whose very name 
seems to be synonymous with physical abuse. In fact, Rihanna’s abuse at the hands of Brown continues to be the punchline to a joke about men who beat their girlfriends.
However, many other men continue to work and win awards 
despite horriﬁ  c criminal records. Google Sean Penn, and you’d be hard-pressed to see any mention of his felony domestic as-sault charge from when he beat his then-wife, Madonna, with a baseball bat. Ditto Roman Polanski and his arrest for raping a 13-
year-old girl; ditto Sean Connery and his alleged abuses against 
his former wife; ditto Charlie Sheen, who shot his former ﬁ  ancee Kelly Preston in the arm in 1990 and his 2009 charges of assault-ing and threatening his wife Brooke Mueller; ditto Mike Tyson and his prison sentence after he was convicted of rape in 1992. 
Because movie, TV and recording executives and these crimi-
nals’ peers refuse to hold abusers accountable, it’s up to you, the consumers, to send a message to the entertainment industry. Don’t go to movies starring and directed by artists with histories 
of violence, don’t buy their CDs, don’t purchase their merchan-
dise — and always, always research the backgrounds of your idols.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Will the Second 
Avenue construction mess you up?Today’s question: Do you like Justin Timberlake?Task force not the solution to rape issue
President Barack Obama recently announced that a 
task force was formed to address sexual assault on college campuses.
I think the task force is a load of bull. Don’t get me wrong; I think it’s important that some-
thing be done about sexual assault. It’s great that the president has made it a priority to reduce assault on campus.
But creating a task force is not the way to go about it.Rape is just like any other crime in that it’s unreason-
able to expect change overnight. A task force can’t just decide to stop sexual assault and magically do so.
This task force seems to serve mostly as a Band-Aid. 
You fell and got a cut, so you patch it up with a bandage to forget about it and let it heal.
The cut is still there, though. Wouldn’t the most ef-
ﬁ  cient way to heal the wound be to avoid falling in the ﬁ  rst place? 
It would be more productive to prevent rape rather 
than to teach schools to handle assaults that have al-ready happened. 
Band-Aids are important, though. So is this task force. 
I’m not saying nothing good will come from it. 
The task force just seems to be ﬁ  xing the effects of 
rape rather than actually stopping assault before it oc-curs.
Rape is a societal problem. It’s not something that can 
be ﬁ  xed by just a few government workers.
It will take the help of everybody because it’s a prob-
lem for everybody. So what can you do?
For starters, don’t rape. That’s an obvious ﬁ  x, but 
hear me out. 
Make sure your partner always says “yes,” and look 
for nonverbal cues of consent. These cues can be things such as laughing and smiling, touching you back and “open” body language, according to Scarleteen.
Don’t take advantage of someone who has been drink-ing too much. Legally, he or she cannot give consent.
Basically, respect other peo-
ple, and don’t be a d**k. Follow the golden rule you learned in elementary school: Treat others how you want to be treated.
If you know someone who 
is a rape victim, support him or her. Victims should be tested for 
sexually transmitted diseases after assault, even if they do not want to go to a hospital to complete a rape kit. 
It might also be a good choice for females to take emer-
gency contraception, like Plan B, after sexual assault.
In addition, it’s important to help your friend emo-
tionally. The emotional damage from assault is often worse than the physical.
UF offers free counseling at the Counseling & Well-
ness Center, so if you or someone you know has been assaulted, I recommend talking to someone about it.  
In the meantime, I support the president, the task 
force and universities around the world in their effort to stop rape — or to at least raise awareness of the prob-lem.
It’s a huge step toward eliminating assault. I am just 
not holding my breath for the results.
Last week, the Alligator wrote an article on the an-
nouncement of the task force. In it, a source said she wasn’t sure if the task force could do anything other than create awareness.
I think she’s right. I think the task force can help uni-
versities be more aware of assault and can teach them how to help victims after the fact, but this task force can-not stop rape itself.
Only we, as a society, can do that.Robyn Smith is a UF journalism sophomore. Her columns

Murphs for Mike 
There’s been a lot of talk about 
Senate minority leader Michael 
Christ’s comments concerning 
the new Taco Libre Party. Some have said he’s angry, whiny and unprofessional. Others have a 
few more choice words for him. 
As the people who elected him 
to represent us in the Senate, we couldn’t be more proud. He’s tell-ing it like it is. 
And that’s what he prom-
ised to do when he ran to repre-sent Murphree in the Senate. He promised to be an independent voice in the Senate, and he has 
delivered. He’s willing to work 
against, and more importantly, 
work with both parties to get things done. We couldn’t be hap-pier with what he’s done so far. 
He’s cut waste from requests 
on the allocations committee, he’s expanded paper recycling in our area, he’s initiated bipartisan co-operation in the senate, and he’s made Murphree residents feel in-cluded in the process. 
SG could use some more 
straight talkers. Christ is willing to call out anyone, regardless of political afﬁ  liation, who he feels isn’t ﬁ  ghting in the best interests of students.
Students pay the fees that fund 
SG. Political parties, regardless of their perspective on SG corrup-tion, should come to the voters with solid plans on how they’d spend that money. 
Some people may want to 
have fun with the millions of dol-lars our student fees make up by offering up just a single, mocking platform point. 
We’re just happy to have a 
senator who will continue to 
ﬁ  ght to make sure every dollar is 
used effectively — even if it takes rufﬂ  ing a few feathers to get it done.

Murphree Area residents UF needs to hold Duke Energy accountable
I would like to shed some 
light on a local issue that hasn’t 
received enough attention. 
Over the next year, the 
University of Florida has the 
ability to take a large step toward 
reaching its goal of carbon 
neutrality by the year 2025.  
Currently, all the university’s 
electrical needs are met by a 
company named Duke Energy.  
Based out of North Carolina, 
Duke Energy boasts that it’s the 
largest electric power holding company. 
Like most large corporations, 
Duke Energy likes to make 
large proﬁ  ts, which explains its 
connection with the American Legislative Exchange Council. 
In the past, ALEC has helped 
prohibit the EPA from establishing carbon-emission regulations and providing legal protection for corporate polluters. 
However, UF’s contract with 
Duke ends at the end of the year. 
This opens up much 
opportunity for UF to invest more in renewable and sustainable energy.   
As a student majoring in 
natural-resource conservation and paying my own tuition, I am ashamed that the money spent for credit hours is helping to fund this company. 
The University of North 
Carolina in Chapel Hill recently fought the same battle and successfully negotiated a contract with Duke to develop wind turbines on campus.  
Student and community 
groups in Gainesville are asking for open inclusion about the 
decision to resign with Duke 
Energy. 
As Duke’s largest customer, 
the University of Florida has the 
ability to make some signiﬁ  cant 
changes to the way it currently 
uses energy and take steps in the 
right direction.

The recent cold snap that froze much of 
North Florida and paralyzed our neigh-bors in Georgia and Alabama doesn’t 
disprove climate change. Period. 
It’s beyond aggravating to read endless 
tweets and Facebook updates claiming that because the thermometer dipped to less-than-average temperatures or due to isolated win-ter weather, climate change is somehow over — or isn’t happening at all. 
Newsﬂ  ash: The weather you’re experienc-
ing in one tiny portion of the world does not mean climate change isn’t happening. 
Look at some developments in the U.S. Cal-
ifornia is experiencing historic drought, and ofﬁ  cials are concerned they could be heading into a multiyear catastrophic drought. When you see long-term changes to your weather, that’s climate — not the short cold spell that required you to wear actual shoes last week. 
We can deny our planet is changing, but 
what happens if we ignore possible devastat-ing changes and it’s too late? What happens if the polar ice caps melt or if places like Australia and Cal-ifornia become inhospitable due to exceptional drought, wildﬁ  res 
and skyrocketing temperatures?
We could ﬁ  nd Earth a far more 
challenging place to live with less 
access to clean drinking water, less land to farm and ultimately a more dangerous place for life.
Sure, it all seems a bit irrational and hyper-
bolic, but blips in the weather for Floridians doesn’t mean we should write off changes that 
nearly all scientists agree are happening. 
What’s even more frightening is that while 
scientists and most rational people agree on 
climate change, the number of people who don’t believe in it is rising.
If we had an alternative to Earth, we could 
ignore it and jet off into space to ﬁ  nd a new home, much like the humans in the ﬁ  lm “WALL-E,” but this isn’t a mov-ie, and NASA doesn’t yet have a program that sends untrained humans into space. Like it or not, we’re stuck here, and it’s about 
time we start paying attention to 
the changes happening. 
Climate change is not some-
thing one individual can tackle, but if we all do our part, we can 
make a difference. Turning off lights when you’re not in a room, riding a bike instead of driving a car, using reusable bags at the gro-cery store or cutting down on meat consump-
tion are all relatively easy ways to cut down on 
your carbon footprint — and they don’t cost much, either. 
Even UF is committed to going green 
through the work of the organization Sustain-able UF. The university wants students, faculty and staff to understand the impact we have on our ecosystem and what we can do to improve that relationship. Ultimately, through educa-tion and technology, Sustainable UF wants the university to be a zero-waste campus. 
It’s an incredible goal, and if UF succeeds, it 
proves individual actions working collectively 
lead to real change for our community.   
The actions of one won’t necessarily make 
a dent in the impact of climate change, but 
when organizations can rally entire college campuses, we can, in fact, make a difference. 
If we consider UF a microcosm of our world 
as a whole, what’s stopping individuals from taking action that leads to widespread positive change for our planet? 
Climate change is perhaps the greatest 
challenge our generation will face, but it’s not too late to make a difference. 
After you ﬁ  nish reading this, don’t forget 
to shut off the light when you leave the room.

Customers wait for their orders in front of the Pelican Brothers food truck at the Original Gainesville Food 
Truck Rally on Saturday, hosted near High Dive. The rally drew 11 food trucks from across the state.  
� THERE WERE 11 TRUCKS. 
KRISTIA WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville residents and stu-
dents came together Saturday 
night to celebrate the ﬁ  rst anni-versary of the Original Gainesville Food Truck Rally.
The event, which took place 
in the High Dive parking lot, in-cluded food from local and trav-eling food trucks from around the state.
The event was inspired by Peli-
can Brothers, a food truck that’s been parked outside High Dive since 2010, said Pat Lavery, a UF 
alumnus and owner of the concert 
and event production company Glory Day Presents. 
Lavery’s company teamed up 
with High Dive to put on the ﬁ  rst food truck rally in January 2013. Since then, the rally has expand-ed to 11 trucks and has grown in popularity.
“We just came up with the idea 
a year ago, and it’s been really, re-ally popular,” he said.
The event catered to all food 
preferences, from the Filipino cuisine of Baboyz Truck to North-eastern food from Monsta Lobsta. The Earth Pets Treat Truck also offered food for dogs. 
Nigel Hamm, owner of Go 
Go Stuff Yourself, said his truck served a lot of customers during the rally. 
The most popular dishes of the 
night were the barbecue quesadil-las, ﬁ  sh tacos and banh meatball sandwich, he said. 
“It’s a more diverse crowd than 
downtown usually gets,” he said. “There are families, UF students, people from all over the place.”

planned for March 15.Food trucks celebrate

A UF study abroad workshop series 
focused on helping students re-enter the 
country has expanded from ﬁ  ve sessions to six. 
Tessly Dieguez, a senior study abroad 
adviser at the UF International Center, said the addition of a sixth session allows 
for more time to emphasize community in-
volvement and academic reintegration. 
Dieguez started the program, called 
“Transitions,” last semester because she felt 
the UFIC’s single re-entry meeting wasn’t enough.
“I wanted to delve deeper into the stu-
dents’ problems,” Dieguez said.Ruben Jean, a 21-year-old UF civil engi-
neering senior who studied abroad in Hong 
Kong last semester, said the extra session 
could ﬁ  ll the gap for UF students who 
didn’t travel with many other Gators.
“You could get a community of people 
who are going through the same thing,” Jean said.
Current study abroad student Sydney Goldstein, a 19-year-old UF business ad-ministration and French studies sopho-
more, said she would consider signing up 
when she returns to ease the readjustment 
process.
“Reverse culture shock is underestimat-
ed and often outright forgotten,” Goldstein said. “My biggest concern is that I will lose momentum and get stuck in a rut.”UF study abroad readjustment program gets broadenedBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Gator named to watch list
UF lacrosse midfielder Shannon Gilroy was named 
to Inside Lacrosse’s Face-Off Preseason Player of the Year watch list on Thursday.The Florida men’s tennis team competed against USC on Sunday. Read the story online at alligatorSports.org.ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
Lightning usually does not strike the same place twice, but for 
Kytra Hunter, perfection did.
For the second week in a row, Hunter scored a perfect 10 on 
floor.
Hunter’s 10 helped the No. 2 Gators (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) hand the No. 1 Sooners (3-1, 1-0 Big 12), last year’s NCAA 
runner-up, their first loss of the season, 197.875-197.225, in the O’Connell Center on Friday night.
Hunter and sophomore Bridget Sloan scored back-to-back 10s 
on floor during UF’s last meet against Georgia on Jan. 24.
“I definitely know there’s still more 10s that I can get,” Hunter said. “Getting a 10 doesn’t mean that I can slack off.”
The last time a Gator scored a 10 in two consecutive meets was 
in 1998 when Susan Hines scored two 10s on vault. Coach Rhonda Faehn said she was unsure if this means Hunter now will get two pictures of herself on Florida’s “Perfect 10” wall in the gymnastics practice facility.
“I felt for quite some time for a few years that she’s been deserv-
ing of a 10 whether it be on vault and or floor at any of the competi-tions,” Faehn said. “I think this is the best floor routine she’s ever had.
“She’s really connecting with the audience and the judges and 
they are connecting with her as well. I think that is the difference LANDON WATNICK

On the afternoon of his 22nd birthday 
Saturday, Patric Young blew out Texas 
A&M’s candles.
The senior center manned the paint dur-
ing the No. 3 Gators’ 69-36 win against the 
Aggies in the O’Connell Center, scoring 
nine points and grabbing a career-best 14 
rebounds. 
Young was only one point shy of his first double-double of the 2013-14 season.
“We just really chased balls as a team,” 
Young said. 
“We were just focused on limiting them 
to one possession on offense, and we did 
that.
“If coach (Billy Donovan) would have 
kept me in, which I wanted, I would have 
had 17, at least. But it is what it is.”
Young’s effort on the glass helped Flor-
ida outrebound Texas A&M 57-27. Sopho-more guard Michael Frazier II tied a career 
high with 21 points but added eight boards. Forwards Will Yeguete and Dorian Finney-
Smith combined for 19 rebounds.
But Donovan said Florida’s gaudy re-
bounding margin had more to do with TA-
MU’s poor shooting. 
The Aggies shot 14 of 54 (25.9 percent) 
for the game and only 4 of 20 from behind the arc.Young leads UF to blowout win against TAMU

Patric Young drives into the paint against Texas A&M on Saturday. Young’s career-high 14 rebounds helped Florida win its 13th straight Southeastern Conference home game. Young fell short of a double-double, notching nine points against the Aggies.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
During the Gators’ record 27-game 
winning streak in the O’Connell Cen-
ter, Florida has hosted and defeated non-conference opponents such as Kansas, Florida State and Wiscon-sin.
However, coach Billy Donovan 
and company tied another equally as impressive record Saturday after-noon against Texas A&M. 
With the Gators’ 69-36 rout over 
the Aggies, they extended their Southeastern Conference home winning streak to 13, which ties the school record set in 1967-69 and 2006-08.
Senior Patric Young, who record-
ed a career-high 14 rebounds Sat-urday, said the team’s selflessness and cohesiveness are the keys to its endurance during the record-tying stretch.
“We just feel no one can beat us 
here,” Young said about playing in the O’Dome. 
“When we come and put these 
white jerseys on, coach prepares us the right way, we come with a great attitude, great chemistry and no one is selfish on this team. We just all want to get it done together and ac-complish a team goal.”
During Florida’s streak from 2006-
08, the offense carried the Gators throughout the home SEC matchups and into the NCAA Tournament, which they won two straight years during the streak. 
The 2006-2008 squad averaged 
77 points per game throughout its stretch of SEC home wins while shooting about 50 percent from the field, 37 percent from behind the arc and 69.1 percent from the free throw line.
Throughout UF’s current streak, 
the Gators managed to maintain the efficiency of the previous record-holding team by sacrificing more than four points per game.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Defense 
wins championships, and the NFL has not 
seen a defense like Seattle’s in a long time.
The Seahawks won their first Super Bowl 
title Sunday night in overpowering fashion, punishing Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos 43-8. 
Seattle (16-3) was too quick, too physical 
and just too good for Denver, and that was true in all areas. What was hyped as a classic matchup between an unstoppable offense and a miserly defense turned into a rout.
Punctuating Seattle’s dominance were a 
69-yard interception return touchdown by linebacker Malcolm Smith to make it 22-0 and Percy Harvin’s sensational 87-yard kickoff runback to open the second half.
“Took us four years to get to this point but 
they never have taken a step sideways,” coach Pete Carroll said. “These guys would not take anything but winning this ballgame.”
The loss by the Broncos again raised ques-
tions about Manning’s ability to win the big-gest games. He is 11-12 in the postseason, 1-2 in Super Bowls. He never looked comfortable against a defense some will begin comparing to the 1985 Bears and 2000 Ravens — other NFL champions who had runaway Super Bowl victories.
Seattle forced four turnovers; Denver had 
26 all season.
The Seahawks looked comfortable and 
at ease, and not just their defense, which lost All-Pro cornerback Richard Sherman to a high ankle sprain in the fourth quarter.
Russell Wilson, who has an NFL-record 
28 wins in his first two pro seasons, including playoffs, had a 23-yard TD pass to Jermaine Kearse in the third quarter to make it 36-0.
Wilson also hit Doug Baldwin for a 10-yard 
score in the final period in what had become one of the most lopsided Super Bowls. For the 
fifth time in six meetings between the NFL’s 
No. 1 offense and defense, the D dominated.
“We been relentless all season,” Wilson 
said. “Having that mentality of having a cham-pionship day every day. At the end of the day, 
you want to play your best football and that is 
what we did today.”
No Super Bowl had been played outdoors 
in a cold-weather city before — not that the Big Apple was anything close to frozen Sunday, 
with a 49-degree temperature at kickoff. And 
no Super Bowl has started more bizarrely.
Things went sour for Manning and the 
Broncos from the very first scrimmage play, and by halftime they were down 22-0 — their 
biggest deficit of the season and the only time 
they didn’t score in a half.
On that first play, Manning stepped up 
toward the line just as center Manny Ramirez snapped the ball. It flew past his incredulous 
quarterback into the end zone, where Know-
shon Moreno dived on it for a safety. A mere 12 seconds in, Seattle led 2-0 with the quickest 
score in Super Bowl history, beating Chicago’s 
Devin Hester’s kickoff return to open the 2007 
game — against Manning’s Colts. 
That one ended much better for Manning 
as Indianapolis won the championship. This 
one was a fiasco throughout.
Steven Hauschka, who missed only 2 of 40 
field goals entering the game, made a 31-yard-
er for 5-0 and a 33-yarder for 8-0 after Doug Baldwin toasted 15-year veteran cornerback 
Champ Bailey, in his first Super Bowl, for 37 
yards on third down.
Then the Seahawks began scoring touch-
downs.
Manning’s third-down pass to Julius 
Thomas sailed way too high and directly to 
safety Kam Chancellor, giving the Seahawks 
the ball at Denver’s 37. Harvin, finally healthy 
after a virtually wasted first season in Seattle, sparked the short drive with a 15-yard burst, and a third-down pass interference call on Tony Carter gave Seattle the ball at the 1.
Marshawn Lynch scored to make it 15-0.Then Smith, with a play emblematic of the 
best defense the NFL has seen in years, made his second huge play in two weeks. Cliff Avril got to Manning’s arm as he was throwing, and the ball fluttered directly to Smith, who took off down the left sideline for a 69-yard inter-ception TD.
Manning trudged to the sideline, a look of 
disgust on his face. That look didn’t improve when, after a drive to the Seattle 19, his fourth-down pass was tipped by Chris Clemons and fell harmlessly to the Meadowlands turf.
So did Denver’s reputation as an unstop-
pable force.

A change in venue could not disrupt 
the Gators’ hot streak.
For the fourth time in as many games, 
No. 2 Florida (4-0) held its opponent 
scoreless in a 7-0 win over Baylor (6-1). 
The first road game of the season 
proved to be no issue for the Gators.
“I thought we played really well to-
day,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
“It was a true test for our three fresh-
men to play on the road, and for the most part, we answered the bell really, really well.”
Baylor’s crowd noise did not rattle 
Florida’s freshmen, who played in their first collegiate road game. 
Freshman Kourtney Keegan and se-
nior Olivia Janowicz won the first dou-bles match in a 6-0 sweep. Soon after, the No. 32 duo of freshman Belinda Wool-cock and senior Sofie Oyen won 6-3 to secure the doubles point.
“[Baylor] had a big crowd and it was 
indoors,” Thornqvist said. “I thought we handled ourselves with 
great poise and competed really well.” 
The Gators quickly went ahead 6-0, as 
five of the six players needed only two sets to win their match. Woolcock won the first singles match 6-0, 6-2, followed by wins from Oyen, Alexandra Cercone, Brianna Morgan and Keegan. 
Janowicz continued to gain experi-
ence in her third match playing at the No. 1 position. The senior lost her first set 2-6, but she then rallied 7-6, 10-3 to take 
the match point.
“It came down to a tiebreaker in the 
third on Olivia’s court,” Thornqvist said. 
“I was really proud to see that when she wasn’t winning that she fought with ev-erything she had to claw her way back into the second set. She fought through that and forced a tiebreaker third set and won that.”

With National Signing Day now just two 
days away, this weekend was a busy one 
for UF’s 2014 and 2015 recruiting classes.
Damian Prince, the No. 2 offensive tack-
le in the 2014 class, took his official visit to UF over the weekend. Prince is picking be-
tween Florida, Maryland and South Caro-
lina.
His hometown of Forestville, Md., is 
just 20 minutes outside of College Park, but 
Florida could get the benefit of getting the 
last impression on Prince. 
He will sign his letter of intent on 
Wednesday.
Five-star athlete Adoree’ Jackson, who 
took an official visit to USC this weekend, 
is still deciding between Florida, USC, LSU 
and UCLA.
Jackson, a Gardena, Calif., native, is in-
terested in pursuing a track career while 
at college. UF’s prestigious track and field 
program could swing him to Gainesville.
Jackson can play both cornerback and 
wide receiver. UF has good depth at cor-
ner, with sophomore Vernon Hargreaves 
III and early enrollee Jalen Tabor, which 
means he could get more reps on offense. 
Jackson is expected to make a decision on National Signing Day.J.C. Jackson, a Florida commit who is 
suspected as wavering on his commitment, 
made a surprise visit to the UF campus Sat-
urday afternoon. He took his official visit to Gainesville on Jan. 17.

It is rare to find a pitcher who can hit the 
ball out of the park when she steps up to the 
plate.
But Florida junior right-handed pitcher and first baseman Lauren Haeger does just that. 
Since she joined the Gators in 2012, the Peo-
ria, Ariz., native leads the team with 32 home runs while also maintaining a career ERA of 2.10 in 253 innings pitched.
“It’s good because I get the pitcher mental-
ity of it, and I get the hitter mentality of it,” Haeger said.
 “It works to my advantage most of the 
time. I think it’s good because I can read pitch-ers’ spins well and I can see movement be-cause I do the same thing. I think it’s good for me; it’s just how I’ve been playing my game my whole life. I think it can only help.”
Haeger’s dual-threat ability was one of the 
reasons Florida had an unexpected successful season in 2013.
Before last season started, the Gators were expected to finish fourth in the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division and seventh in the conference as a whole.
“When I first saw at the beginning of the 
season what people thought about us, I was like, ‘Well, there are still people here. Things happened, but there are still people here who really care,’” Haeger said.
But thanks in part to Haeger’s team-leading 
.676 slugging percentage, 23 RBIs and eight home runs in conference play, which helped spark the Gators offense, UF finished 18-6 in SEC regular-season play.
Florida followed that performance by go-
ing 3-0 in the SEC Tournament, defeating Ala-bama, Georgia and Missouri by a combined score of 27-13 to win the conference title.
“We all came together at the right time 
last year,” Haeger said. “We’re all really close; there’s no drama. Everyone is fun to be around. I love being around these girls, and you have to, especially with all of the hours you put in with each other. I think with our chemistry and everything has been carrying over to this year as well.”
Haeger finished 2013 with a .319 batting 
average and a team-leading 70 RBIs and 18 home runs — the third- and sixth-highest UF single season totals, respectively. In the pitch-ing circle, Haeger went 16-2 with a 2.6 strike-out-to-walk ratio. Six of her wins came against top-25 opponents.
For her career, Haeger holds Florida’s 
fourth-highest slugging (.652) and on-base (.451) percentages while also ranking eighth in 
batting average (.320) and ninth in home runs 
(32).
In the circle, Haeger’s 6.86 strikeouts per 
game is the third-best UF mark, and her 248 strikeouts, 31 wins, 20 complete games and eight shutouts all crack Florida’s top 10. 
With the start of the No. 4 Gators’ 2014 sea-
son only three days away, Haeger, a member of the USA Softball Collegiate Player of the Year Top 50 watch list, hopes for the team to build on their unexpected triumphs from last season. 
“It’s more motivating and exciting than it is 
feeling pressure,” Haeger said. 
“I like pressure. That’s how I like to play 
and that’s how I like to perform.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2014

After Saturday’s 179-121 win on the 
road over No. 18 Tennessee, the No. 2 
Florida’s men’s swimming and diving team (8-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) extended its dual meet win streak to 
23 — a stretch that spans the past three 
regular seasons.
Florida’s 
flight to Ten-nessee on Fri-day morning 
was canceled, and the team hopped on a bus for the 10-hour trek to Knoxville, Tenn. But the weekend’s real drama 
came during the eighth-ranked Florida 
women’s team’s (5-3, 3-2 SEC) confer-ence matchup that was decided by the narrowest of margins.
Down the stretch, the Gators rallied.Three events remained as sophomore 
Delaney Dye helped bridge the 17-point gap with a win on the one-meter spring-board. Fellow sophomore Lindsey McK-
night was at the forefront of the 1-2-3-4 
finish for Florida that ensued in the 200-yard individual medley, which put her team ahead late.
With the Gator women holding a 
five-point lead entering the final event, the No. 12 Lady Vols (8-1, 4-1 SEC) showed they still had the makeup of the third-place finisher at NCAA Champi-
onships they were a year ago. 
Tennessee out-touched Florida by 
more than a second to win the 400-yard 
freestyle relay, and junior Molly Du-brasky was called for a false start on UF’s “B” relay, ending Florida’s hopes of saving a tie in Knoxville in the 152-148 loss.
It was only the second time Florida 
has fallen to Tennessee in the schools’ 28 matchups.
But for the Florida men, it was busi-
ness as usual.
Senior Marcin Cieslak, redshirt senior 
Sebastien Rousseau and juniors Dan Wallace and Eduardo Solaeche-Gomez – solid scorers for Florida all season – didn’t even swim the max number of 
events against Tennessee (5-4, 3-2 SEC).

Records are meant to be broken. And that 
is what Ciarra Brewer did on the final day 
of the Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, 
Ark., on Saturday.
The junior jumper 
claimed the nation’s top 
triple-jump mark, notch-
ing a 13.55-meter jump.
With the final day of 
the meet set in the record books, the Gators finished 
behind No. 1 Arkansas (first place) and No. 5 men’s Texas A&M (sec-
ond place) as the No. 2 men’s team scored 90 points and the No. 4 women recorded 84 points.
“I am extremely pleased with the week-
end overall at a great meet with great teams 
competing,” coach Mike Holloway said. “I 
thought it was important for our team to come into this meet with the right mind-set.”
The Gators entered both days of compe-
tition with experienced athletes leading the 
way.
Marquis Dendy (jumps) and Arman Hall 
(sprints) took care of business on Day 1 as they both earned first-place finishes in their respective events. 
In opening-day action, Brittany Harrell 
also highlighted the women’s team with a 
third-place finish in the pentathlon. 
On the final day of competition, middle-
distance runner Ryan Schnulle clocked the 
second-fastest 800-meter run in the country, 
directing himself to a first-place finish of 1:48.05.
Senior Eddie Lovett finished in first place 
in the men’s 60-meter hurdles for a third consecutive victory in the event this season. 
Mark Parrish clocked his personal best in 
the men’s 3,000-meter with a time of 7:59.72, crashing into UF all-time’s record books 
with the second fastest mark. 
“I’m also very proud of Mark Parrish 
in the 3,000 meter,” Holloway said. “He doesn’t especially love indoors, and for him 
to come out here and have the performance he did was really great.”
UF will return home for a week of prac-
tice and get back to competing on Friday and Saturday when it splits for the Armory 
Invitational in New York and the Virginia 
Tech Elite Meet in Blacksburg, Va.
“I’m very proud of our team, but it’s over 
now,” Holloway said. 
“We’ll get back to Gainesville, get rested 
and get back to work.”Brewer sets top triple-jump markHaeger led 2013 team in RBIs

Sloan wins three events against Sooners
maker this year.”
Sloan won the all-around title 
and posted the best score in three 
of the meet’s four events. She 
scored a 9.950 on vault, beam and 
floor, while she notched a 9.90 on 
uneven bars. Sloan said she knew her side aerial on beam was the de-ciding point.
“It just makes me want it even 
more,” Sloan said. “With that 9.95, I could easily get a 9.975 or 10.”
Last weekend, Sloan scored a 10 
on floor. But on Friday, she could not repeat that level of success on the event.
“Man, I think it was my leaps,” 
Sloan said. “My leaps or my dou-
ble pike was a little low.
“It’s crazy, those little things. In 
elite, the little things they make a 
difference but not that much. But here it’s like, man, if I would have 
pointed my big toe I could have 
had a 10.”
Friday, Florida scored its high-
est vault score of the season with a 
49.475 against Oklahoma.
Florida’s uneven bars perfor-
mance was not quite as improved. Senior Mackenzie Caquatto, the second-to-last Gator on the bars lineup, had a misstep to the right in her landing. She earned the low-est score of Florida’s bars total of 
49.400 with a 9.850.
Freshman Claire Boyce gave 
her best beam performance yet 
with 9.90. Sloan was the only Gator to outperform Boyce with a 9.95 on 
beam. 
On floor, Boyce scored a 9.825, 
slightly lower than her floor score 
of 9.875 against Georgia.
“She’s just getting better every 
meet,” Faehn said. “I told her all 
fall that she’s capable of being a 
9.90 to a 10 on balance beam every time she gets up there.”GYM , from page 12
Florida believes defense can improve after 33-point victory
Georgia, the team has averaged 72.92 
points per victory while also shooting about 50 percent from the field, 37.4 percent from behind the arc and 68.4 percent from the free-throw line.
Despite the slight dropoff in point 
production from the previous streak, the Gators have made up for it with a stingy defense.
During the 13-game streak, Florida 
has held its opponents to about 49 points a contest. The 2006-2008 squads gave up more than 65 points per game.
Michael Frazier II said the most en-
couraging part of the Gators’ defense is its ability to adapt and improve by learning from dominant performances like Saturday’s against Texas A&M.
“It’s scary because I think we can get 
a lot better defensively,” Frazier said. 
“Not a lot of teams have the oppor-
tunity to be great, but we feel like in-side our team we have enough pieces to be great. Whenever we don’t chase greatness, whenever we get outside the process, we are doing ourselves a dis-service.”
Donovan, who earned his 200th ca-
reer conference win and 182nd with the Gators on Saturday, agreed with Fra-zier that his team can keep improving its historic defensive effort by focusing 
on chemistry among the players and 
selflessness on the court.
“I think we’ve got a group of guys 
in there that care,” Donovan said. 
“I think they understand there’s 
good chemistry there, there’s good connectivity. I don’t think they’re the kind of guys that want to let each other down.”
The team’s continuity changes in a 
positive way when Florida attempts to break the school’s SEC home winning streak record Tuesday night against Missouri. 
Freshman Chris Walker, who was 
approved to play by the NCAA on Wednesday, will join the Gators’ front-court and make his collegiate debut. Donovan said he will play Walker, but the freshman phenom will appear as more of a role player Tuesday.STREAk , from page 12TAMU’s 36 points tied the 
fewest UF has ever allowed in 
an SEC contest.
Young helped UF enter 
halftime with a comfy 34-17 advantage, powering the Gators to a 20-5 run during the final nine minutes of the first half. 
After the contest’s first 20 
minutes, the senior had team highs with eight points and seven rebounds. 
The highlight of Young’s 
game was a two-handed putback slam that gave the Gators an 18-12 lead with 8:11 remaining in the first half. Af-ter Kasey Hill missed a layup, Young charged down the lane and caught the ball in mid-air for the dunk. 
“I really thought his energy 
was very, very good,” Dono-van said of Young. 
“I told him I’m going to 
start telling him every game is his birthday.”
In the second half, Frazier 
carried the team offensively. 
Following a slow start to 
the game from behind the arc — Frazier and Florida began with a 1-of-12 clip from three-point range — the sopho-more sharpshooter found his groove during the latter end of the game. 
After going 0 of 3 from 
three-point range in the first half, Frazier made 3 of his 8 attempts from downtown. 
“Just not rushing my shot,” 
Frazier said. 
“They just told me to keep 
shooting, and I found a rhythm there. You have games like that, but you’ve got to stay confident.”
Casey Prather, who did not 
start but came off the bench at the 18:08 mark in the first half because of ankle soreness, scored only seven points on 3-of-5 shooting in 21 minutes. The senior forward’s perfor-mance breaks a double-figure scoring streak of 18 games.
Florida has now won 13 
straight games and 27 consec-utive games at home. Satur-day’s win also helped Florida tie its record of 13 straight SEC home wins. 
“We’re chasing greatness,” 
Frazier said.
Florida’s next game — the 
much-awaited debut of fresh-
man forward Chris Walker 
— will be against Missouri on Tuesday night at 9 in the O’Connell Center.
With a fatigued roster — 
DeVon Walker (hip pointer), Prather (ankle) and others are dealing with minor inju-ries — Donovan thinks hav-ing another body will help the Gators’ cause.
“We’ll see what he can give 
us,” Donovan said.

Successful rebounding was ubiquitous 
in Florida’s 81-60 win at Ole Miss on Sun-
day. 
The Gators cruised to their third con-
secutive Southeastern Conference victory while splitting the rebounding battle with 
the Rebels, 42-42. 
However, the biggest rebound comes 
on a broader scale. After dropping three 
consecutive conference contests, Florida has bounced back with a purpose, winning its next three games.
“We take great pride in making ‘small-
er’ better than ‘bigger,’” coach Amanda Butler said. 
“We want to win the rebounds, win the 
battle in the paint. We feel like size can be a factor if we let it, but we can’t let it. We’ve got to make us being smaller be the more important thing.”
The Gators found themselves in an 
early 7-0 hole fewer than two minutes in. But the Rebels’ run was quickly thwarted thanks to freshman Ronni Williams’ ensu-ing three-point play. 
Williams was very active in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve 
minutes of the contest, tallying ﬁ  ve points, two boards and two personal fouls in that span. For the game, she scored 11 points on 5-of-7 shooting and notched seven re-
bounds. 
With 13:16 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half, 
the Gators took a 15-14 lead and did not 
look back. Florida was leading by as much as nine points in the ﬁ  rst half thanks to a career game from Antoinette Bannister.
The sophomore guard had the hot hand in the ﬁ  rst half, going 3 of 4 from three-
point range with 12 points. Bannister 
scored a career-high 18 points on the after-noon, shooting better than 50 percent from the ﬁ  eld. 
“Bree’s a shooter at heart,” Butler said. 
“She’s a ball player. She can pass the ball and make plays, but when the ball felt good off of her hands behind the three-point line, I think that just fueled the whole 
rest of her ball game. 
“She deﬁ  nitely gave us a great shot in 
the arm.”
Ole Miss stormed back at the end of the 
ﬁ  rst half, but Florida managed to hang on, 
taking a 33-31 lead into halftime. 
“I thought the whole ﬁ  rst 20 minutes 
of basketball was below where we needed to be playing intensity-wise, energy-wise, 
our level of awareness,” Butler said. 
“We weren’t playing poorly, but we 
weren’t playing as well as we needed to 
be play.”
The Gators’ counter to the Rebels’ rush 
at the end of the ﬁ  rst half ended up being too much for Ole Miss to handle.  
Florida exploded into the second half 
with a 27-7 run spearheaded by Williams 
and redshirt junior Kayla Lewis.
Lewis had one of her best games as a 
Gator on Sunday, scoring a team-high 19 
points on 9-of-12 shooting as well as notch-
ing a team-high 12 rebounds. 
“We’re not necessarily out to win the 
rebounding battle, but we have to neutral-
ize it,” Butler said. 
“We felt like the rebounding battle in 
the ﬁ  rst half was not just being won by them, but it was the biggest impact they were making in the game.”
With rebounds neutralized, it was Flor-
ida’s shooting that again propelled it to victory. 
In the second half, the Gators shot 18-
of-31 from the ﬁ  eld. For the game, they shot 8-of-25 from beyond the arc, thanks to 
Bannister and senior Lily Svete shooting a 
combined 7-of-14 from three-point range. 
Florida is currently in good standing 
to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament, 
but a tough road lies ahead. Ranked foes 
Kentucky, South Carolina, Vanderbilt and Texas A&M are all waiting for the Gators down the stretch. 
“Even though we were able to pull 
away there at the end,” Butler said, “I think there’s going to be a lot of things that we can watch and learn from this ballgame.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2014
