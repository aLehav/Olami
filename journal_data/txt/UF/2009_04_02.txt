The Gainesville Police 
Department will look for 
drunken drivers at a DUI 
checkpoint tonight at 4000 
S.W. 23rd Terrace.
The Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Office and the University 
of Florida Police Department 
will assist in the checkpoint, which will take place from 7 p.m. until 2 a.m.
The last GPD DUI check-
point in March, which was held at 3300 W. University Ave., yielded 11 arrests, six of them DUIs, GPD Sgt. Joe 
Raulerson said.
Raulerson said GPD 
would like to stop every car that goes through the check-
point, but if there is heavy 
traffic the officers might only 
pull over every fifth car.
Some of the possible con-
sequences of a DUI are fines 
up to $500, mandatory DUI 
school, jail, community ser-vice, vehicle impoundment and a driver’s license sus-pension, he said.
Raulerson said officers 
understand that people want to go out and have a good time, but he wants them to stay sober if driving.

use RTS buses, Later Gator or taxis,” he said. GPD to target

With fall registration in full swing this 
week, some students in the UF Department 
of Electrical and Computer Engineering are 
upset by the resignation of their only adviser 
following an investigation into two student 
privacy violations. 
On March 13, Steve Permann, the depart-ment’s only undergraduate adviser, submitted a letter of resignation. Though the resignation 
is not effective until May 15, Permann’s last day was March 6, which has left the depart-ment without an official adviser. 
Mark Law, the department chair, said in 
a forum held to address the concerns of stu-dents in the program on March 17 that the de-partment probably would not hire a new ad-viser until fall. The responsibility of advising students before they can register—a require-
ment in the department—has fallen on Marcy 
Lee, a program assistant who has worked with 
Permann for the past year. Lee has di-rected students with questions she can’t 
answer to professors.  But many students just want the guidance of Permann, who advised in the department for 12 years and was famil-iar with faculty and courses. 
“I am worried about registration. I feel lost. 
I’m not going to go to my professors because I feel like they only know about that class,” said Suzanne Delica, an electrical engineering ju-nior and president of Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Some people around the coun-
try might be up in arms over the 
latest salmonella scare, but it turns out some Gainesville resi-dents aren’t nuts about pistachios anyway.
The Food and Drug Adminis-
tration announced Monday that a California-based food-processing plant will recall up to 1 million pounds of roasted pistachios that may be contaminated by salmo-nella.
Local grocery stores are deal-
ing with the potential problem by removing pistachio products from the shelves.Ward’s Supermarket natural 
foods manager Russ Welker said Ward’s pulled all pistachio prod-ucts, packaged or fresh, Tues-
day.
“We went through and pulled 
everything we could find,” he said.
Welker said he doesn’t expect 
Ward’s’ business to drop as a re-
sult of the crisis.

Man arrested after beer stolen early Wed.
A man was arrested early Wednesday morn-
ing after he was accused of stealing beer from a 
Kangaroo and carrying brass knuckles.
While inside the Kangaroo on Southwest 34th 
Street, Garrett Kautz, 19, asked the store clerk if he would call the police if Kautz stole a beer from the beer case he was standing in front of, the Gainesville Police Department arrest report stated.
According to the report, after the clerk walked 
away to call law enforcement, he saw Kautz leave the store with a large bulge in his front pocket.
When a GPD officer found him, Kautz was 
walking away from the store and carrying a can of Steel Reserve. According to the report, the of-ficer found two pocket knives and brass knuckles in his pockets.
The store clerk told the officer that Kautz was 
trying to sell a pocketknife and the brass knuck-les. Kautz was charged with an open container violation, petit theft and carrying a concealed weapon.

Like the Y2K bug, the projected havoc 
the Conflicker computer worm threatened to 
wreak  on April 1 seems to have been bloated, but the threat remains.
Conflicker infects computers and creates 
its own network, which could allow cyber-criminals to take control of users’ computers to send spam or attack particular Web sites. Estimates put the number of infected comput-ers at several million.
Experts had feared that a reference to April 
1 in the worm’s code indicated that it would go live worldwide on that date, causing un-known damage. As for now, the worm chang-
es security settings on infected computers and 
blocks access to anti-virus Web sites.
Kathy Bergsma, UF’s information technol-
ogy security manager, believes that the threat to UF is minimal.
“We’ve had way less than 50 infected ma-chines on campus,” she said, indicating the number could be as low as 20.
UF has monitored the worm since it ap-
peared in October 2008 and has been in con-tact with other universities on how to cope 
with developments, such as new strains of the worm.
Although the ports, or entry points, that the 
worm would use to enter UF’s network have 
been blocked, it could still spread into the net-work through an infected laptop or USB de-vice, Bergsma said.                    
Ed Wedge, manager of the computer repair 
company Gatorland Computers, said that he had extra staff on hand Wednesday in case the worm turned violent. “We’re gearing up for whatever comes down the road,” he said Wednesday afternoon.LOCALFew computers affected by Conflicker worm threat
An Ocala man was issued a notice 
to appear before a judge for a misde-meanor possession of marijuana after reportedly trying get a 19-year-old UF student to engage in oral sex.
Joseph J. Wilkins, 40, pulled his car 
onto Union Road, next to Tigert Hall, from Northwest 13th Street and began following the student, who was walk-ing, Saturday around 5 a.m., according to a University Police Department re-port.
A UPD officer parked in the Tigert 
Hall parking lot and approached the 
student, who appeared upset, and 
asked if everything was OK. The stu-dent told the officer that the man in the car kept asking if he could “suck his dick,” the report stated.
The officer then pulled Wilkins’ 
car over and asked him what was go-ing on. Wilkins said he stopped to ask the student for directions, then, when pressed, admitted he asked the student for oral sex.
The student did not file charges.During a search of Wilkins’ car, an 
open Marlboro Lights pack with five 
marijuana roaches was found, accord-
ing to the report. Wilkins told police he thought the roaches were left in the car 
by the previous owner.
He said a man outside 
the Kangaroo gas station on the corner of North-
west 13th Street and University Ave-nue offered him oral sex for $50 earlier 
in the night. Wilkins said he thought 
the student was hanging out with the man, so he followed him to see what was going on, the report stated.
Wilkins was also ticketed for no 
proof of insurance, driving without a license and driving an unregistered ve-hicle, the report stated.

� HE FACES UP TO A YEAR IN PRISON 
AND A $1,000 FINE.
The University Police Department is filing 
a sworn complaint against Gainesville resident 
Richard White, 41, for reportedly exposing his genitals to at least one woman outside the McKnight Brain Institute on Monday night.
White has been suspended from his job as 
a supply technician at Shands at UF pending the results of the investigation, said Shands HealthCare spokesman Jeff Kelly. White  is be-ing charged with exposure of sexual organs, a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Though he was reportedly wearing light 
green scrubs with an ID badge during the in-
cident, Kelly said White was not on duty at the time, adding that White’s job involves no direct 
contact with patients. He approached a female Shands at UF employee outside the institute at about 10 p.m. and asked her for money. When 
she said she didn’t have any, he pulled his 
pants down, according to UPD.
White allegedly approached another wom-
an as well before leaving in a small purple car with a spoiler. He was found about an hour and a half later by a GPD officer who stopped a vehicle on Archer Road matching the descrip-tion. White was picked out of a photo lineup by both women, according to UPD.
He has been interviewed by UPD and noti-
fied of the complaint. Spencer Mann, spokes-man for the State Attorney’s office, said the office hadn’t received it as of Wednesday after-noon.

 Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact, and UF spokesman Steve Orlando look 
on as Al Eisele, editor of The Hill, answers questions about President Obama and the media in Pugh Hall on Wednesday. Adair and Eisele were part of a lecture titled The Administration & The Media. 
 By CAROLYN TILLO  
 Alligator Contributing Writer 
  
 Two editors with about 65 
years of combined journalism ex-
perience took the stage at Pugh Hall Wednesday night to de-scribe the media’s inﬂ  uence on 
President Barack Obama’s cam-
paign and the Internet’s impact on print journalism. 
Bill Adair, Washington Bureau 
Chief of the St. Petersburg Times, 
and Al Eisele, editor at large of 
Washington D.C. congressional newspaper, The Hill, spoke to a crowd of about 100 people and 
answered questions from audi-
ence members and UF spokes-man Steve Orlando.
Adair said covering Obama’s 
campaign was not different from 
covering any other election.
The campaign was unusual be-
cause press operations included 
new techniques, such as Obama’s 
use of Facebook to rally support, 
Adair said. 
Eisele compared Obama’s 
use of YouTube to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ﬁ  reside chats.
“Obama is the ﬁ  rst Internet 
president,” he said.
Eisele said the media’s cover-
age of the campaign was mostly 
objective considering the unique 
nature of Obama’s candidacy. 
He said people underestimate 
what an incredible thing it was to have a black president elected, and said Obama’s election al-
lowed the world to see the U.S. 
in a new light. Talk of new be-ginnings transitioned into a dis-cussion of the end of newspaper journalism. Adair said journal-
ists need to take advantage of the 
Web and use it as a research and presentation tool.
“And, it is time for news or-
ganizations to reinvent them-selves,” Adair said.
Adair, who also founded Poli-
tiFact.com, a Web site that rates the truthfulness of political of-
ﬁ  cials’ claims on a scale ranging 
from “true” to “pants on ﬁ  re.”
News organizations need to 
help people ﬁ  gure out what in-
formation outlets they can trust, 
he said. Eisele said as newspa-pers move to the Web, the media loses its watchdog function.
The problem with the Web is 
that there is no gatekeeper, Eisele said. Both editors also defended the media’s role in the ﬁ  nancial crisis.
“If you’re looking for a scape-goat, you better look somewhere else than the media,” Eisele said. 
Adair said the ﬁ  nancial crisis 
was an example of the govern-ment’s role as a watchdog.
UF sophomore Zach Mayo 
said he was not impressed by the 
speakers’ mentality  that nothing 
was the press’ fault.
But he said he liked how the 
speakers said the newspaper in-
dustry needed to move forward 
in its use of the Internet.
The two speakers also dis-
cussed the creation of citizen-journalists, who use the Internet 
to blog about newsy happenings. 
Adair said the media needs to 
trust users to help create its prod-
uct. But this is hard for journal-
ists who fear losing their jobs to 
citizens, he said. Adair also ques-tioned the deﬁ  nition of blogger.
“It’s a meaningless word,” he 
said.
Although he does not discount 
the importance of bloggers, he said a new term should be creat-ed to separate journalist-bloggers 
from citizen-bloggers. 
Eisele said “blogger” was not 
the only word in need of revamp-
ing, and he considered the new meaning journalism will take 
on because of the impact of new 
technology.
“To take that a little further, I 
think maybe we need a new word 
for journalism,” Eisele said. ON CAMPUSCenter holds Q-and-A session on media, presidency
“If you’re looking for a 
scapegoat, you better look

Costs of drug testing 
outweigh benefits
SNAPs for BarryDeclaring America’s current economic woe a time for 
“tough love,” one West Virginia legislator wants to mandate drug testing for individuals receiving govern-
ment assistance. 
State Rep. Craig Blair, shockingly a Republican, sponsored 
a bill that would require passing a drug test before a person could receive benefits such as welfare, unemployment and food stamps. Under his proposed guidelines, Blair offers first-time offenders 60 days to sober up but strips repeat transgressors of their government aid for two years.
Has America suddenly channeled its inner Wal-Mart right 
before our very eyes?
The Editorial Board can’t help but think Blair is off his rocker 
when suggesting drug testing is a surefire way to get millions 
of Americans off of federal assistance. What makes Blair’s argu-
ment completely useless is the fact that he fails to account for the outlandish costs involved with forcing countless individuals to piss in a cup. We can only imagine how much red tape would accrue if Blair’s bill somehow managed to pass — leaving peo-ple who’ve never touched an illegal drug in their lives to wait even longer before receiving help.
How about some compassion for the innumerable Ameri-
cans left jobless for no other reason than their companies can’t 
afford to pay them?
Blair’s ludicrous attempt to save the economy while ridding 
America of its drug problem seemingly serves to spread a right-
wing agenda and oppress those hit hardest by the financial downturn.
What more would you expect from an attention-starved 
state representative from West Virgina lacking any semblance of a college education?
Thanks to a swift stroke of President Barack Obama’s pen, Florida 
residents will see increased financial assistance in their 
monthly food stamp allot-
ment starting this month.
 On Feb. 14, Obama signed 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 — legislation that boosts the amount of economic relief families receive by at least $20 per person. Under the 
program, the more than 1.8 
million Floridians currently enrolled to receive aid will see their EBT card’s balance surge by as much as $24.
Additionally, the Food 
Stamp Program has been re-branded as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP) to highlight the nutri-
tion information available for families to learn more about how to shop for healthy food while on a budget.
In the state of Florida, the 
portion of the population receiving government assis-tance for groceries jumped 31 percent from one year ago. The $34 million upgrade com-ing to SNAP is expected to 
generate $63 million in eco-
nomic activity in Florida.
The Editorial Board is 
pleased to see components of Obama’s economic recov-ery plan coming to fruition so close to home. As prices for staples such as milk and bread continue to put a dent 
in Floridians’ wallets, the in-
crease in financial assistance under SNAP will certainly help many families make ends meet. What makes the program a resounding success is the fact the state will see a significant economic gain — welcome news to countless 
struggling businesses. 
While SNAP should not 
be deemed a cure-all for the 
many Americans going to bed hungry at night, the program is certainly a step in the right direction for the country.
While I am happy to see that our country is mov-
ing in a more progressive direction, I am sad that I cannot say the same about the Universi-
ty of Florida. Our good president Barack “The Messiah” Obama is steering the nation toward a much fairer, re-distributive taxation and social program system which will take from the greedy rich bastards to provide for those who have fallen on harder times. Every single rich person in America, after all, “earned” his or her fortune by denying opportunities to the poor.
Unfortunately, UF still clings to an archaic grading 
system which gives preference to those who were born 
as intelligent and hard-working students at the expense 
of those who, by no fault of their own, were not born in such a privileged state. 
These students get locked into a “grade poverty trap” 
that destroys their motivation and self-esteem. They 
cannot hope to compete with the greedy A-students 
who hoard all the good grades among themselves. 
Accordingly, I propose that UF adopt a system of 
“grade redistribution” to make grades more equal across the board and give failing students a better op-portunity to succeed. This will put the school more in line with the progressive politics of our generation.
The system would be a simple. Every high-earning 
student would be given a progressive, bracket-based grade tax. For instance, all grades from a 2.0 to a 3.0 might be tax-exempt, grades from 3.0 to 3.5 might be taxed at a 50 percent rate, and grades from 3.5 to 4.0 might be taxed at a 90 percent rate, like the AIG bo-nuses. 
This means that the bright, diligent grade-grubbers 
who extort their way to a 4.0 would end up with only a much more reasonable 3.3, only a hair higher than the equally qualified students who manage a 3.5.
Meanwhile, the grade rev-
enues collected from these stu-dents could be used to fund grade welfare programs for the failing students. All students would be guaranteed a minimum grade income of at least a 2.0. Any ad-ditional revenues could be given 
back in the form of grade-tax credits to the lowest-earn-
ing students.
This would provide a much more equal system of 
grading that doesn’t give substantial preference to those 
more capable of earning grades. Those who don’t do well in school and don’t work hard, study or compre-
hend the material don’t fail through any fault of their 
own. They were born at a significant disadvantage from 
those who work and study hard, and they need to have the same opportunities to succeed in life as talented stu-dents.
It is socially unjust for an elite few students to be 
earning a 4.0 when there are students struggling just to pass their classes.
The school has an obligation to its grade-poorest stu-
dents to provide for them in their times of need. The government does this for the impoverished, and it does it by taking from the rich. It is only right and just that UF should do the same thing.
We can only hope that UF will end its evil, capitalist, 
“free-market” approach to grades and embrace the pro-gressive, redistributive mindset of our new generation.

Marijuana users aren’t addicts 
Legalizing marijuana is the equal 
of allowing a nation whose leader 
openly called for the destruction of an entire nation to have nuclear weapons? 
A bit of a stretch, but that is the 
claim of Gary Colon in Wednesday’s Alligator. While it is terrible that Co-lon’s father was forced to spend nine years incarcerated and unfortunate that his father began using other un-specified drugs, this is not the case for average users. Addiction is a problem for some, but why is it that Colon is not advocating for prohibi-tions on alcohol and tobacco sales? 
Each is heavily addictive and 
hazardous to one’s health. Driving under the influence and second-
hand smoke pose a risk to others as 
well. Not all marijuana users claim it is a panacea, simply that there is a huge disparity in how they are treated compared to users of other, legal, substances. 
Will legalizing it fix the economy, 
end the Mexican cartels’ violence and stop the pain of cancer patients everywhere? No. But if marijuana is 
kept as a Schedule I substance, alco-
hol should be, as well. 
Unfair treatment and stigmatiza-
tion of a class of people by poorly 
thought-out laws should not be al-
lowed. The inflammatory nature of 
Colon’s letter, while based on diffi-
cult personal experiences, is far from a rational argument. Marijuana, just as it is not a wonder drug, is neither 
necessarily a gateway drug. 
Not everyone starts shooting her-
oin after that first puff; most reach 
for the Doritos and the Wiimote, not the needle.

Marijuana should be legalized
Gary Colon’s article is so fal-
lacious I’m almost positive it’s an April Fools’ Day joke. You claim that marijuana is still bad even though “it 
doesn’t cause as many deaths as oth-er drugs”. The truth is nobody has 
died from smoking pot, ever. If you don’t believe me then please supply me with the name of a person who has died solely from cannabis use.
It is too bad that your father 
didn’t have enough self-control and ended up in prison because of his drug abuse, but should we believe that just because some people are al-coholics, alcohol should be banned? Drugs are to be used responsibly and by adults only.  
The reason your father eventu-
ally fell into other drugs is prob-ably just because of the illegality of marijuana. When somebody wants to buy weed they have to resort to “criminals” who are many times of-fering them other illegal and very 
dangerous substances. 
Also, it looks like you didn’t read 
the recent article about the arrest in 
Eastside High School where officials found 2.5 pounds of grass in three students’ backpacks. Right now, it is much easier for kids to buy marijua-na than to purchase alcohol because drug dealers don’t ask for identifica-tion.       
In times of economic crisis, we 
should stop wasting money incar-cerating harmless potheads and start creating an industry that would make our economy grow and flour-ish.

Obama deserves a fair shake
Here we are in the first three 
months of having Barack Obama as 
president, and what respect has he 
been given? 
None. The same country that voted him 
in is now criticizing his every move. I, for one, am sick of it. When I turn on the TV, I don’t care about some 
comment Obama made regarding 
the Special Olympics, and I know Tim Shriver doesn’t, so why do we? It is our place to get upset for Tim Shriver? No. Then the next item of discussion 
is the “glare seen around the world” probably literally because since he 
made it we never heard the end. 
And for what? So maybe we have a president who thinks before he 
speaks. I mean we are becoming a 
society of people who don’t allow 
chances. Do we expect to come out 
of a recession like nothing?
Sacrifices must be made and it 
will take time. All I’m saying is that we are doing what we do best, which 
is set the people we once praised up 
for failure. 
Can we give Obama a chance to 
survive in our world? We think we can judge someone by his actions and our opinions on them, and its not possible. Obama’s actions are justified and supported by experts. 
My rant is a reaction to reading 
“Palin 2012!” because I feel bad that there are people out there with actu-
al Palin 2012 bumper stickers. Sore 
losers if you ask me.
Chris Moody
Almost everyone recognizes the im-
portance of sustainability. Ameri-cans are beginning to prioritize en-
vironmental protection, create a renewable 
power economy and conserve energy. Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s stimulus package, bills 
in the state legislature, and UF’s sustainabil-
ity programs have all made sustainability a 
priority to prevent energy waste and avert 
climate change. 
So why is Student Government under-
mining the green push by attempting to de-
fund a key sustainability group?
The many members of Gators for a Sus-
tainable Campus have successfully pushed for a renewable energy fee, sponsored the re-
cycling Green Team at home games, helped implement recycling programs at bars and 
apartment complexes and worked in the Gainesville community on local agriculture and in public schools. GSC has partnered 
with UF’s Office of Sustainability for Earth 
Month in April and efforts to green transpor-
tation in Gainesville. 
For its efforts, it has earned grant money 
and last year’s campus Outstanding New 
Organization award. 
Like hundreds of other student groups, 
GSC receives money from Student Govern-
ment to carry out its work. This year, GSC re-quested about $6,000 — the same amount the 
group received last year and just a fraction of 
SG’s $13.6 million budget. But in GSC’s most 
recent hearing before the Student Senate Budget Committee, the 
committee made a pre-liminary vote to com-pletely defund GSC.
The reason? Student Government created its own sus-
tainability agency, Gators Going Green, as 
an SG bureau. The agency’s leaders would 
be appointed by SG officials instead of be-
ing chosen by grassroots advocates. Budget 
Committee members said that SG would not 
“double-fund” sustainability groups. 
But Gators Going Green is an agency that, 
so far, exists only on paper  — and GSC is 
an established grassroots student group. It 
makes no sense to defund students already 
doing the work. Some day, Gators Going Green might be a valuable partner, but it 
should not replace GSC. 
Gators for a Sustainable Campus mem-
bers — including outgoing and incoming 
executive boards — oppose the move to de-
fund GSC, as does UF’s Office of Sustainabil-
ity. Even the director of SG’s environmental 
affairs cabinet — the predecessor to Gators 
Going Green — thinks defunding GSC is a 
bad idea. 
The Budget Committee should reconsider 
its position, and the Student Senate should 
vote to fully fund GSC. The sustainability of our campus depends on it.

senting Hume Hall and is the Orange & Blue

� BOTH STOLEN CARS WERE 
RECOVERED LATER THAT DAY. 
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
Two cars were stolen and at least two 
others were damaged on campus Thursday, 
according to University Police Department 
reports.
Both of the stolen cars were recovered.
The first car reported stolen was a 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass owned by Roy Wilds, 
60. 
Wilds told UPD he left the car in the 
Physical Plant Division parking lot off Ra-dio Road when he went to work at 5:45 a.m. 
When he returned at 3:30 p.m., he said the 
car was gone.
At about 10:20 that night, a Gainesville 
Police Department officer saw the car driv-ing erratically on Northeast Waldo Road.
The officer followed the car, which made 
a sharp left turn and eventually made its way through a grassy field before crashing into a ditch, damaging the front of the car, according to a UPD report.
The suspect, who fled on foot, is described 
as a black man with dreadlocks in his 20s. He wore dark pants and a black T-shirt at the time of the incident.
The second car was reported stolen by 
William Adams, 18. Adams told police he left his 1985 Chevrolet Caprice Classic at 
Parking Garage 5, behind Hume Hall, on 
March 22. 
He said when he returned on Thursday 
the car was gone, according to a UPD report. There was broken glass where the car had been.On Friday at about 11 a.m., a UPD officer 
noticed the car at the PPD parking lot.
There was damage to the passenger-side 
rear vent window, the report stated.
An Olde English 800 beer can, a plastic 
cigar tip,  a bag of Wonder Bread and a Mc-Donald’s cup, all of which did not belong to Adams, were found in the car.
Also on Thursday, two Cadillac DeVilles, 
one a 1998 model and one a 1999 model, re-portedly had windows broken. 
The incidents occurred at Parking Garage 
5 and in the Elmore Hall parking lot off Ra-dio Road, according to UPD reports.On c AMpuSCars stolen, damaged in campus garages Thursday
THE ASSOcIATED pRESS
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — 
Gov. Charlie Crist’s celebrated $1.34 
billion deal to buy 180,000 acres of U.S. Sugar Corp. land to help restore the Everglades is being scaled back 
by more than half because the state 
can’t afford the original deal, the governor announced Wednesday.
The reduction means the state 
will now buy 72,500 acres of land for $533 million, and hold a 10-year op-tion to buy the remaining land. The decision means the original deal — hailed by environmentalists — will 
be far less ambitious than planned.
“The economy has been what it 
has been and we have to deal with 
the parameters that we are given,” Crist said. U.S. Sugar, the nation’s largest cane sugar producer, owns a vast amount of land between Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades. En-vironmentalists have long criticized the sugar industry for cutting off the natural flow to the River of Grass and contaminating it with fertilizer.
The goal of the land purchase is 
to convert farm land into conserva-tion land, allowing water managers to create a system to clean and store water before sending it south into 
the Everglades.
In June, Crist an-
nounced a $1.75 bil-lion deal which in-cluded U.S. Sugar’s 
assets, such as its mill, railroad and citrus processing plant. In Novem-ber, the revised $1.34 billion deal was announced that didn’t include 
those assets. The South Florida Wa-
ter Management District plans to borrow money through bonds for the deal and pay off the debt with property taxes from its 16-county region.Land deal scaled back

Despite rainy weather and change of plans, 
the ninth annual Pride Awareness Month began with laughter on Wednesday night. 
The month-long series of events is put on by 
UF’s Pride Student Union, an organization that hopes to educate UF about issues concerning the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. The organization hopes to create awareness and celebrate the lives of the LGBT community, ac-cording to UF sociology senior Davier Rodriguez, director of Pride Awareness Month. 
A Wednesday morning kick-off carnival was 
canceled due to rain, but there are plans to re-schedule it later on this month. 
But Marga Gomez, a lesbian comedian, still 
performed to about 75 people later on in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom, entertaining the crowd with stories about her life.  The Tranny Road Show, a transgender troupe that features break-dancing, rap, poetry and folk singers, will per-
form in Gainesville on April 10., according to the 
event’s Web site at www.ufpam.org. 
Steve Hildebrand, Barack Obama’s campaign 
director, will also be visiting campus to speak about LGBT leadership within politics.
This year’s theme, “Dare to,” challenges stu-
dents to go outside their comfort zones, Rodriguez said. The Pride Student Union will be offering events such as a poetry night and “Paint-Your-
Orgasm.” They will also show films and hosting 
forums for students to learn more about the LGBT community. 
Rodriguez said this year’s goal was to cater to  
UF students by co-sponsoring events with groups like cultural clubs, fraternities and sororities.  
Rodriguez said he is excited for what the 
month will bring and encouraged students to come out to this month’s events. 
“Our community is one that is misunderstood 
and not accepted,” he said. “Through direct ex-posure and active collaboration we can start to understand each other.”Comedy kicks off Pride Month

ing in response to help undergraduates pick their summer and fall classes. 
Brian Sapp, an electrical engineer-
ing graduate student who has served as 
president of both organizations in the 
past, said peer advising is important be-cause students need a resource to help choose “manageable schedules.” 
Delica said that is what Permann 
was good at. 
“Steve kept it real. He told you who 
to take. Not to say he swayed my de-cision, but he gave me the foresight to 
make my decisions,” she said. 
Students are especially frustrated 
because top-level administrators have 
remained tight-lipped on the circum-stances surrounding Permann’s sudden resignation.  
At the advising forum, Law repeat-
edly avoided questions about Permann. 
“I’m not allowed to discuss the de-
tails of Steve’s situation, and that’s re-ally all I can say about it,” Law said. 
However, the privacy report con-
cerning the situation surrounding Per-mann’s resignation was available under the Freedom of Information Act. 
On Aug. 21 and Sept. 3, Permann 
accessed student record information without authorization, according to the report. An investigation by the UF Pri-vacy Office recommended the dismissal of Permann, according to the report. 
Permann did not return repeated e-
mails from the Alligator and a working phone number could not be obtained. 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando would 
not comment on the situation, but said although advisers are able to access any student’s records, they are only au-thorized to access records of students whom they are advising. 
Support for Permann from students 
has been strong. An online petition titled “Stop the forced resignation of Steve Perman” had 326 signatures as of Wednesday night, including some from UF alumni.  Clinton Rodgers, an electri-cal engineering senior, is organizing a good-bye party for Permann tonight to 
give student closure on the situation.

like, ‘Man I wish I could just hug him,’” 
Rodgers said. “He was a great guy. He was responsible for 1,000 kids and he knew us.”Students threw good-bye party

 There’s more to cyberspace than Facebook, which means there are far 
less creepy ways to connect to millions of users around the globe. So 
go ahead — step outside of your virtual comfort zone. Human-to-human 
contact is so overrated. 
 1)Twitter: It’s a stalker’s best friend. Twitter allows you to update your 
friends on your current whereabouts, as often and mundane as you please. Narcissistic? Maybe, but it’s the one place on the Internet you 
can actually give a play-by-play of your daily activities free from interrup-

coming up Grab your tie-dye, your peace signs and your anti-war slo-
gans — it’s time to let your hair down and let the sun shine. 
Florida Players, UF’s student-run theater company, is put-
ting on the epic American tribal love-rock musical, “Hair,” 
this weekend at the Nadine McGuire Black Box Theatre. 
The show — a story about a tribe of young hippies living 
in Central Park in the late 1960s — originally debuted in 1967 during the Vietnam War sending bold messages of peace, love, sexuality and racism across the country. 
Director Jennifer Shorstein, a senior history major, said 
“Hair” is more relevant than ever today. 
“There’s so much going on now that is too similar to the 
scent that was in the air politically and socially back then,” she said. 
The show’s relevance hasn’t solely been noticed by UF, ei-
ther, as the Florida Players’ production is just one of the few that have popped up around the country. 
Aside from currently playing on Broadway as a revival, 
Florida State University and theater companies in Jacksonville and Milwaukee have recently refreshed the moving piece. 
Doug Sharf, a junior theater performance major, plays 
George Berger, the quintessential leader of the hippie tribe who drops out of high school and refuses to go to war. 
Sharf said the show’s relevance proves that “you can al-
ways stand up to what’s going on,” but more importantly, it instills love and hope that the world can change tomorrow, which is something America must have at a time of war. 
“Everyone needs a little more love in their life, and love is 
the underlying reason to do everything,” he said. 
And with the recent 50th anniversary of the peace sign, 
hippie culture is more of a trend now than ever. 
So, with the combination of lively rock music and bohe-
mian-chic costumes, it’s extremely relatable for today’s pop culture offering a fresh piece to the standard happy-go-lucky world of Broadway shows. 
“It’s more than a fluffy musical,” said Kaitlin Lawrence, a 
sophomore who plays Sheila, an NYU student who protests Vietnam. “It’s not as sparkly as other shows because you see the scariness of war.” 
And in true hippie culture, the show has no rules. There’s 
interaction with the audience, many drug references, people jumping around everywhere and even full nudity. 
Show times are Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 
p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. The performances are free and open to the public. Tickets can be reserved through the Florida Players’ Web site at www.floridaplayers.org.THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11
Hippie revival 
more than just a 
musical
Right now, high school seniors all over the country are hear-
ing back from colleges and preparing to take that next big step 
into college. For nostalgia’s sake, let’s recall what was running through our minds as we read our own college acceptance let-ters:
Well, this is it. College. The real deal. Everything will be so 
different.
In college, I’ll really have to work hard if I want to make the 
grades. No more skipping class or waiting until the last minute to study. 
I mean, I’ll have to get serious if I want to go to medical 
school — a dream I’ve had since I was five and will probably never change my mind about. Forget that C-plus in honors chemistry. Maybe I’ll sign up for one of those fun, multiracial study groups studying under a tree like I saw in the brochure. 
And to think how my social life will change. I won’t have 
to worry about my wardrobe so much, that’s for sure. In col-lege, no one cares how you look, which is why everyone wears pajamas all the time. 
College students are mature; they don’t waste time with 
gossip, drama or Facebook.
I’m going to have so much sex! And it’s going to be with a 
bunch of attractive, sophisticated people who won’t judge me 
afterward. I’m going to impress them with how much I can 
drink and how, unlike most freshmen, I don’t get really annoy-ing when I’m drunk. And that “freshman 15” myth won’t apply to me. I guess I have to be realistic too. My sweetheart and I can’t 
stay together forever. It seems like just yesterday we held hands at church camp the summer after ninth grade. Now, we’re go-
ing to different schools. We’ll probably make it work for the 
first two years by calling every night and hanging out on the weekends, but eventually I’ll have to move on. 
After all, my beautiful, baggage-free soul mate is waiting for 
me in one of those wild keg parties they have on every street corner. 
Really, I just can’t wait to be on my own. In college, no one 
holds your hand — not my teachers, my friends or my par-ents.
Ugh, my parents. Thank God I’ll never have to talk to them 
again.College acceptance letters bring back memories

“ASHLEY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITERTexas band takes on Gainesville
“Who’s Tebow?” asked Michael 
Murray, lead guitarist of the band 
The Banner Year.  
When he found out it was a UF 
quarterback, he jokingly replied, “I 
don’t listen to football.”
Although the band mem-
bers may not be the big-gest football aficionados, one  
thing for sure is that they master the art of rock music.
The five guys from Austin, Texas 
are amicable as they speak proudly of their five-year devotion to the band. The Banner Year, who got the idea for their name by having “a re-
ally bad year,” is excited to come to 
Gainesville. 
Lead singer of the band, Jason 
Small, claimed that he always want-ed to conquer this city. 
“Bands like Against Me! are from 
this part of the country. All their songs are about loving it there or wanting to leave. I’m definitely ex-
cited to see it.”
According to Small, their music is “punk enough to rock out, pop 
enough to sing along and main-
stream enough for all the hardcore 
kids to hate us.” 
The band has played with bands 
from all different genres, including 
punk, metal and pop. They are big 
fans of the Foo Fighters and The 
Offspring—who they aspire to be 
one day. 
The Banner Year has a strong fan 
base back in Texas and are always excited to see familiar faces when 
touring the rest of the country. 
“We have a lot of the same peo-
ple come to our shows. Fans are our 
friends,” Small said. 
They hope to reach anybody 
with their music because their songs are about universal messages. 
“We’re not looking for a specific crowd,” he said. “If people can relate to our songs, we relate to them.”
If they had it their way, the band 
would constantly be touring. 
“It’s all about the attitude,” Small 
said. “We show up on time, try to treat everyone with respect, take responsibility. We take things seri-
ously. We don’t make promises we 
can’t keep. This is our job. We play to five like playing to 500.”
Every song is “performed.” The 
band aims to put on a show, not merely sing to the audience. 
“If you want to hear the music, 
then you can just listen to the CD,” bassist Josh Smith said. 
As long as the audience is having 
a good time, the band members said that they have a good time too.
“You can’t take yourself seri-
ously, life is too short to be serious,” Small said. 
They often insult each other, but 
only to get the crowd laughing. The only surprise is that fans wonder 
why they don’t have such thick Tex-
as accents.Photo courtesy of The Banner Year

There are plenty of salads and you can build your own or enjoy locally produced tempeh, avocado, and teriyaki on the one hand, or a loaded pie like the mighty meaty or the 10-ingredient house special.

VietnameseDining Out“Dalai Lama Renaissance,” the new movie from documentary ﬁ  lmmaker Khashyar Darvich, fol-
lows the journey of 40 of the world’s top minds as they meet with the Dalai Lama to discuss prob-
lems facing the world. The project, known as the Synthesis Conference, was meant to group some of the most progressive thinkers in one location to brainstorm a way to change the world, with the Dalai Lama acting  as spiritual adviser. But 40 top minds also means 40 large egos, creating contro-versies over face time with His Holiness and disagreements about conferences parameters. Though the conference seems doomed from the start, the wisdom of the Dalai Lama shines through the arguments and the bickering, providing a revelation that proves more personal than worldly. 
Director Khashyar Darvich discusses his experiences with the Dalai Lama and the Synthesis 
Conference and its impact on him and the other participants.14, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2009
 What drew you to this project?
I have always had respect for the Dalai 
Lama because he is one of the top advocates for peace in the world. I was actually asked to produce this ﬁ  lm by the organizers of the meeting with the Dalai Lama because I had interviewed and ﬁ  lmed the Dalai Lama for 
two previous projects.  I accepted the offer to 
make this ﬁ  lm because it was an opportunity 
to spend several days with the Dalai Lama and be a part of an event that had the goal of impacting the world in a positive way.
What proved to be the most difﬁ  cult challenge for you while making this ﬁ  lm?
I think that the greatest challenge in mak-
ing the ﬁ  lm took place after I returned from India to the United States with 140 hours of footage that we had ﬁ  lmed. Because there is usually no script for most documentary ﬁ  lms, the story has to arise during the editing pro-cess from the footage that was ﬁ  lmed. So, it took some time to ﬁ  nd the story that we felt would most powerfully impact the audience.
What was accomplished by the confer-ence?
Many of the people who were at the event 
went on to become very prominent and in-ﬂ  uential in the world. And nearly everyone credits the experience with the Dalai Lama 
that is captured in the ﬁ  lm as a transforma-
tive event that impacted their life and their 
work from that time onwards.
What was the impact on the individual participants?
Most of the people there came away with 
the clear idea that the most effective way to create positive change in the world was to ﬁ  rst change themselves. As we change our-selves, becoming happier, clear and com-passionate, we impact those around us and that emanates outward.
What made you choose documentary ﬁ  lmmaking?
I ﬁ  rst began as a writer writing poetry. 
And although poetry does reach and impact people, I wanted my time and effort to have a positive impact on as many people as pos-sible. The medium of the documentary seems to suit me because the stories are honest and real, and I have a lot of freedom to craft a story that is authentic and one that inspires me. 
“Dalai Lama Renaissance” is playing at the 
Hippodrome through today. The movie will be coming out on DVD at the end of April.sex on the avenueBromance makes sense
JACK BENGE � AVENUE CONTRIBUTING WRITERSTEPHANIE DUNN � AVENUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER
with KHASHYAR DARVICH
documentary ﬁ  lmmaker
 Brody Jenner stared at me from 
the other side of my TV, spray-
tanned and wide-eyed. “What’s 
a bromance?” he asked incredulously. 
As if I should innately grasp the ho-mosocial premise for his new series. 
Uh, you tell me — dude.
Because for months, I haven’t been 
able go to a movie without feeling the 
man-love. The social phenomenon of bromances goes beyond the carefree but charmingly homophobic friend-ships of a simpler time; it embod-ies the type of drama and unbridled admiration that borders on “Broke-back.” Where did this come from, and, more importantly, why are rela-tionships now deﬁ  ned through port-manteaus?
George and Jerry foreshadowed 
the “man-crush” back in the early ‘90s. Then came Wayne and Garth. Beavis and Butt-head. Joey and Chan-dler. J.D. and Turk. By 2000, the allure of bromances expanded beyond TV and into reality. We watched the love 
between Damon and Afﬂ  eck ﬂ  ourish, 
the playful pranks of Pitt and Cloo-
ney and the shirtless escapades of Armstrong and McConaughey.
Even sports were given some soap-
opera-style drama with the advent 
of the bromance. Would Shaq and 
Kobe ever get along? Does D-Wade seriously spend the night at LeBron’s house when their teams play one an-other? Were Romo and Witten really slipping each other secret plays, as Terrell Owens accused, or was T.O. just jealous of their tightness? 
Movies now glorify the somewhat 
sweet, somewhat creepy trend. This weekend, when I saw the John Ham-burg-directed “I Love You, Man,” I couldn’t help but feel like I’d already heard the man-crush jokes in every other comedy of the past few years, beginning with “Wedding Crashers.” 
But of the current crop of direc-
tors, Judd Apatow is the most bro-liﬁ  c of all, pairing Michael Cera and Jonah Hill in “Superbad,” Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen in “Knocked Up” and Seth Rogen (again) and James Franco in “Pineapple Express.” 
To be fair, the ladies celebrated 
their Traveling Pants and Ya-Ya Sis-terhoods. They shared cosmos and sexcapade stories on TV. Chick-ﬂ  icks abounded, and chick-lit poisoned bookstores nationwide. Yet no one knocked the female bond or accused the women of being lesbians. 
A bromance sounds ridiculous, 
but offers pragmatic solutions to our quarter-life crises. We’re graduating, but most of us sure as hell aren’t get-ting married, and a lot of us aren’t even getting jobs. Bromances are the perfect codependency tool, ﬁ  lling the emotional void a serious girlfriend otherwise would have. 
Shacking up with your special 
man-friend during the post-college, pre-marriage drifting period makes sense ﬁ  nancially and saves guys from quick-to-commit girlfriends.
So here’s to making nonsensical 
nicknames for one another. Here’s to caring more about how you look in front of your special man-friend than you do in front of your girlfriend. 
Here’s to sleepovers, giggly gam-
ing marathons and matching…well, anything. 
Here’s to you, bromosexuals.

POLL QUESTION UF BASEBALL I DID NOT KNOW THATHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF outfielder Michelle Moultrie waits in the outfield during the Gators’ 9-1 win against Alabama 
on Saturday. Moultrie hit her first out-of-the-park home run against Auburn on Wednesday.
� THE FRESHMAN’S HOME RUN 
CAME IN A PINCH-HIT AT-BAT.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
After Michelle Moultrie’s flyout 
ended UF’s chances of a seventh-inning 
come-from-behind win against Alabama 
on Sunday, Francesca Enea said the freshman would be cranking home runs like Enea in a few years.
As it turns out, it only took a few 
days.
Pinch hitting for right fielder Alicia 
Sisco in the top of the seventh in the first game against Auburn on Wednesday 
with the Gators up 2-0, Moultrie nailed 
a solo shot out of right-center field for 
her first out-of-the-park longball at UF. 
Moultrie’s first career hit was an inside-
the-park home run against UNLV on 
Feb. 21.
“It was great. Pinch-hit home runs, 
they just don’t happen very often in soft-ball,” UF coach Tim Walton said. 
Moultrie did not start either game of Wednesday’s doubleheader, but her 
home run helped the No. 1 Gators (36-3, 15-1 Southeastern Conference) secure a 3-0 win in Game 1 against Auburn (25-
12, 5-6 SEC). 
The freshman also knocked a pinch-
hit double to left field in UF’s 7-1 win in 
Game 2 in Auburn, Ala.
Pitcher Stacey Nelson (20-3, 0.43 ERA) 
held the Tigers to only two hits, walked 
no batters and struck out nine in Game 1.
UF secured its 2-0 lead 
well before Moultrie’s 
home run, thanks to a two-
RBI bomb to left field by 
first baseman Ali Gardiner in the third 
inning.
Other than Moultrie, only the top 
three hitters in the Gators’ order — Aja Paculba,  Kelsey Bruder and Gardiner — recorded hits in Game 1. The bottom of the lineup came up empty, as the four through nine batters in UF’s starting line-up had no hits. 
In Game 2, though, those batters 
sparked the Gators’ offense. Moultrie homers in 
doubleheader sweep
Softball
If men’s basketball coach Billy 
Donovan had left the program for Kentucky over the weekend, it 
would have been a devastating blow 
to UF basketball.
The team would have been with-
out the identity that Donovan gives 
to the Gators. UF commit Kenny Boynton told the Alligator on Tues-day that he probably would have de-committed from UF without Dono-van here. And the players left on the roster would be playing for someone who didn’t recruit them.
Yes, that would have been terrible 
for a program in the middle of some serious rebuilding.
But something else happened over 
the weekend and into the first half of this week that drastically damaged the Gators’ chances of winning in the next few years. Two huge coach-ing moves in the Southeastern Con-ference have brought stiff competition for years to come.
The first 
big announce-ment — one that came on Friday — was that former UF 
assistant coach Anthony Grant, who took Virginia Commonwealth to the NCAA Tournament the last two years, accepted the head job at Ala-bama.
Grant is now the only SEC coach 
other than Donovan to have won a national title, and that came while he was an assistant under Donovan.
Grant’s hire by the Crimson Tide 
hurts the Gators because he knows all about recruiting in the state of New coaches should scare UF

CORAL GABLES — In a game filled with 
the nation’s best, Kenny Boynton proved he 
belonged.
Boynton, a UF commit from American Heri-
tage Plantation High, scored 10 points and had 
three assists, helping the East beat the West 
113-110 in the 32nd McDonald’s All-American Game.
The game was played in Florida for the first 
time, taking place at the Bank United Center on the University of Miami campus.
Boynton, the only in-state participant, re-
ceived a standing ovation from the 5,981 fans in attendance during the lineup introductions.
“It’s good to know that you have your com-
munity behind you,” Boynton said.
Both coaches rotated their lineups during 
every TV timeout, and Boynton entered the game for the first time at the 15:28 mark.
His first appearance was uneventful, as he 
missed his only shot attempt and split point guard duties with Peyton Siva.
Each team played man-to-man defense, and 
Boynton matched up with FSU commit Mi-chael Snaer.The West team screened Boynton on al-
most every possession, helping Snaer score 13 points.
“They kept running off screens on me,” 
Boynton said. “It made me more tired for of-fense.”
Offensively, Boynton created his own shots, 
displaying ball-handling skills and a quick crossover. He looked rusty early in the game, 
turning the ball over on a 
first-half fast break, but he calmed down as the game progressed.
His best play occurred 
early in the second half. Snaer guarded him tightly while Boynton strung to-gether a series of crossovers before pulling up and swish-
ing the ball from 15 feet out.
“Snaer was guarding me and he was bump-
ing me, (but) I just said in my mind I was going 
to get to the basket regardless,” Boynton said.
The future Gator displayed good court vi-
sion in the second half, getting assists on back-
to-back fast breaks including an alley-oop to Dante Taylor.UF MEN’S BASKETBALLBoynton shines in Miami

SEE BOYNTON, PAGE 23SEE EVAN, PAGE 23the sleepless night trying to dis-
guise her nerves with support for Smith.
It was the last night Smith 
would be flesh and bones before 
becoming flesh, bones and metal.
“I didn’t have any apprehen-
sion about it, nervousness of 
course,” said Smith’s father, War-ren. 
Warren said he even wanted 
to watch the surgery but wasn’t allowed. 
“One of her trainers down 
at UCLA went in and watched (and) said she was not prepared for what she saw,” Warren said.
Warren recalls being in the recovery room after her surgery, when his daughter woke up screaming in that moment of ex-cruciating pain.
“I was kind of shocked be-
ing in the recovery room with 
all these other patients that were 
recovering from different surger-ies. I didn’t know how to react,” Warren said.
Smith’s response to the sur-
gery was surprising even to the doctors. She ended up having to stay three days in the hospital.
“I couldn’t move my leg,” 
Smith said. “I couldn’t really wiggle my toes. It was awful. The first three days to two weeks, I was like, ‘What did I do? Why did I do this?’”
Smith was confined to her bed those first three days. With her leg harnessed and in a full-leg cast, even sleeping was a chal-lenge.
“When I’d be asleep, I’d 
twitch and end up straightening 
my knee and I would just lose it 
again because I was straightening something they drilled a hole in,” Smith said. “Sleeping was awful, during the day was awful. Every-thing was just bad.”
She remembers switching off 
crying with her roommate at the hospital. When her roommate 
was crying, Smith would call 
the nurse, and when Smith was bawling, her roommate fulfilled the nurse-calling duty.
Finally, Smith was discharged, 
but that just meant dealing with pain in a new setting.
When she finally could crutch 
around, she still couldn’t shower properly. With her thigh-high cast, Smith would lift her entire leg over the bathtub ledge, tape trash bags all the way up to her hip and stand on her good leg with her trash-bag-clad leg out of the shower because she couldn’t get the cast wet. 
Crutches and all, Smith only 
let the injury impair her to a point. 
Two years before her surgery, 
she and two high school friends had planned a Hawaii vacation as their senior trip. With her cast taken off, Smith crutched the beaches of Hawaii.
“Sand and crutching, I never 
would recommend it,” she said.
Box-Jumping Rock Bottom
For a gymnast, wiggling toes 
would hardly seem to take a con-scious effort, but that’s exactly 
what Smith faced when starting 
rehab.
After wiggling her toes, 
she graduated to bending and straightening her knee, which took her two weeks. She then re-learned how to walk. And finally, she started jumping on a box an inch off the ground.
It took more than a year before 
she could run and jump normal-ly, and it’s still a challenge for her to jump off her right leg by itself.
With the titanium rod func-
tional, life back at UCLA wasn’t what Smith had enrolled early for.
“My injury took away why 
I wanted to be there,” she said. “I wanted to go to UCLA to do gymnastics, and I wasn’t able to do it. In the end, it was not a fun time doing gym.”
Masking it well, Smith shocked 
her teammates when she sudden-ly left UCLA. It was three days — the same amount of time she’d been hospitalized — between her announcing it to her coaches and her leaving for Sierra (Calif.) Community College.
“It wasn’t just, ‘Oh, I’m hurt, 
I’m going to quit.’ I had tried so long to come back and it just was not working, so the passion and drive just left me,” Smith said.
So she thought.Back in Sacramento, Smith 
started coaching at her club gym, Byers Gymnastic Center, where she coached the level-7 (out of 10) 
group. There she saw how much 
fun the girls were having, how easy it was for them to do skills that months before had come ef-fortlessly to Smith.
Curiosity gave way to experi-
mentation, and little by little, Smith’s passion flooded back.
“I started mentioning to Carl 
(Moore, my boyfriend) and my parents, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if I could start doing gym again?’” 
But before she could even set 
foot on a mat, Smith had to get back in gymnastics shape. 
So she and Moore, a current 
UF wide receiver, trained in the gym, doing box jumps.
“I didn’t even act like her boy-
friend when we were training,” Moore said. “I used to get mad 
at her, and she’d get mad at me, 
but at the end of the day, she did everything she had to do to get it done.”
Some parts of her training 
sessions with Moore, like bench-pressing and doing pull-ups, Smith didn’t mind. It wasn’t until she worked out her leg that her dread kicked in.“I’d be jump-roping or box-
jumping, and I’d have tears com-ing down my cheeks,” Smith said. “There was no boyfriend-girlfriend relationship whatsoev-er (in the gym). We’d be scream-ing at each other.”
Box by box, Smith jumped 
higher and higher up to a rib-high 
box. She never missed a box. 
She credited Moore as the one 
who got her ready to compete 
at the college level again — this time as a Gator.
Smith 2.0
She remembers the butterflies 
when she had to do that first tumbling pass on floor exercise in practice after two years — now as a member of the UF gymnastics 
team. 
“What if my leg just dies?” 
She stuck that first pass and 
has stuck countless ones since. Balance beam, which she never thought she would compete on again, is now part of her reper-toire.
Though her scores are better 
than those two meets at UCLA, Smith will tell you she’s not a better gymnast because of the in-jury.
She wonders sometimes if 
she’d taken two more months off, if maybe there would have been some change. 
What she does know is that 
her surgery was life-changing. It has given her perspective.
“I’ve been through injuries, 
I’ve been through times where gymnastics is not easy,” Smith said. 
Because of her injury, she tries 
to console teammates, letting them know they aren’t the only 
ones to sustain injuries.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn be-
lieves the injury has made her a 
stronger-willed person.
“She could have easily said, 
‘Oh, woe is me, I have a rod in my leg, I shouldn’t be doing gymnas-tics anymore. I’m going to slink off to the side over here,’” Faehn 
said. 
“And instead, she’s done the 
exact opposite.”
In June, it will be three years 
since Smith’s operation.
“It doesn’t seem like it has 
been three years,” Patty said. 
“But looking at what she’s ac-complished, it’s just awesome.”22, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2009

Florida. His presence just eight hours away will hurt 
UF’s recruiting in the future.
“I explained to (my son, Anthony Jr.) the oppor-
tunity that Alabama presented, the opportunity to be 
significant, to accomplish some things that had not 
been accomplished, to blaze your own trail,” Grant said in his press conference earlier in the week.
He’ll get his chance to blaze a trail with the Tide, 
but it will take a few years for him to get a program 
built.
The more immediate problem for Donovan and 
the Gators is the man who did accept the head coach-
ing job in Lexington — former Memphis coach John Calipari.
Calipari has never won a national champion-
ship, but he’s come close recently. The coach won the Conference USA regular-season and tournament titles the last four years (against admittedly weaker competition than in the SEC) and did the same with Massachusetts in the Atlantic 10 Conference for five straight years.
Sure, Kentucky is a program on the downturn 
right now. But Billy Gillispie, whom the Wildcats 
fired on Friday, was not the right fit.
He was an up-and-coming coach from Texas 
A&M who had never advanced past the Sweet 16 as 
a head coach. He rose to a major job way too fast, and he burned out under the harsh scrutiny of the 
Wildcats faithful.
Calipari has been there before, however, and his 
aura in the Bluegrass State spells more immediate 
problems for UF.
Calipari was modest at his press conference in 
Lexington on Wednesday.
“I do not walk on water,” Calipari said. “I do not 
have a magic wand.”
But he might as well have one. He had the No. 1-rated recruiting class this sea-
son at Memphis, but now that he’s leaving, several of those players might come with him to Kentucky.
And with Jodie Meeks and Patrick Patterson re-
turning next year, the Wildcats should be a lock for the Sweet 16.
The SEC was a laughingstock among college bas-
ketball fans last season. It was a disgrace of a ma-jor conference that had just two teams in the NCAA Tournament.
But all that has changed in one weekend. Ala-
bama and Kentucky have made their moves to com-pete once again in the SEC and on a national scale.
Now it’s UF’s turn to stay relevant.EVAN , from page 21
� THE RB WAS PART OF A 
SIMILIAR OFFENSE AT USC.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
Maybe UF coach Urban Meyer isn’t 
excited about the prospects of the I-
formation in Gainesville, but one of his running backs is.
Meyer said earlier this week that the 
I-form may not last long for the Gators due to a lack of depth at tight end and fullback, but running back Emmanuel Moody is enjoying the new package.
“It definitely excites me, because it’s just another way to get the ball to the running back,” Moody said. “I feel like one of the reasons they did it was to give the running backs a head of steam so we can use our vision more.”
Moody excelled in a pro-style of-
fense as a freshman at Southern Cal and earned Pacific-10 Con-ference Offensive Fresh-man of the Year honors, but adapting to the spread wasn’t an easy 
task in his first year at UF.
Moody tallied 417 yards and one 
touchdown on 58 carries last season — still a better yards-per-carry average than he notched at USC — but he was never a primary option in the rushing game.
He said he’s comfortable in the 
spread now and looking forward to playing more freely, without having to think as much as he did in 2008.
But a go-to running back has yet to 
emerge. Jeff Demps is splitting time between football and track, leaving Moody and Chris Rainey as the main ball-carriers in spring practice.
“We’re still looking for an every-
day back, and we don’t have one right now,” Meyer said. “Everyday means pass protection, not grabbing his foot 
every time he gets tackled, and we’re 
not there yet. They’re good, we just need an everyday guy.”
Moody excited about I-formation
Football
With the score tied at 1 in the fifth inning, Enea showed 
off the power she said Moultrie would develop, blasting her 
third grand slam of the season to left field and turning a tie game into a rout.
“Both Tiffany and Ali had great at-bats before her, and 
then Francesca saw a good pitch and just hit it really well,” Walton said. 
After back-to-back doubles put the Gators up 1 heading 
into the bottom of the fourth, Auburn center fielder Lindsey Harrelson tied it up with a leadoff home run off Stephanie Brombacher. 
Brombacher then gave up a hit and a walk, leading Wal-
ton to replace her with Nelson. The senior ace gave up only one hit and struck out three batters in her four innings of relief. Walton mixed up his lineup Wednesday as well. In 
Game 1, he moved Bruder from right to center and put Sisco in right field. 
DeFelice started the game as the designated hitter, which 
Sisco had played in the Gators’ last six games. Because of off-season wrist surgery, DeFelice has been in and out of the lineup this year.
Walton continued his lineup changes in Game 2. He 
moved Bruder from the second spot in the order — where she had been hitting since Kim Waleszonia was injured on Feb. 28 — to the fifth spot, putting DeFelice in the two hole.
“(DeFelice’s) on-base percentage is really high, and I 
didn’t want to give up on an opportunity to drive in more runs,” Walton said. 
“She’s a matchup problem because she can do so many 
things — she can hit and run, she can bunt, she’s so good at a lot of different things.”Enea breaks tie with third grand slam of season
SOFT , from page 21
The game was expected to feature 
many highlights, and the players did 
not wait to get started. An impromptu dunk contest began as the pregame layup line gave way to an assortment 
of reverse jams and windmills.
It didn’t take long for an in-game 
dunk to materialize either, as Avery 
Bradley Jr., Monday’s Powerade Jam Fest winner, electrified the crowd with a two-handed tip-slam 30 seconds into the game.
Boynton tried to dunk but failed as 
the ball slipped through his hands and 
softly bounced into the hoop.
“On that play, I was undecided. 
(The West’s) John Henson jumped 
and he messed my mind up,” Boynton said.
The game was sloppy early, with 
many players turning the ball over and slipping on the sponsor logos.
With less than 10 seconds left, the 
East padded its lead to 113-110 when Derrick Favors slammed an alley-oop from Lance Stephenson. Mason Plum-lee missed a 3-pointer for the West as 
time expired to give the East the win.
Favors was named the game’s 
MVP, scoring 19 points and grabbing 
eight rebounds in 18 minutes.
Favors, an imposing, 6-foot-9, 
220-pound forward, abused the rim on four dunks.
“Favors had a lot of crazy dunks,” 
Boynton said. “He had a great game. I 
enjoyed watching him tonight.”Georgia Tech commit drops 19 points, wins MVP

Maranda Smith opened her eyes and 
screamed.
Bloody murder.
She awoke to find herself in the recovery 
room at the UCLA Medical Center following a 
surgery where she had a 20-inch titanium rod 
inserted into her right shin.
“I can’t even explain the amount of pain I 
was in, instantly,” Smith said. “Like the second I opened my eyes, I was in tears screaming.”
The rod, which goes from just below her knee 
to the top of her ankle along the shin bone, was the result of a shin that’s given Smith trouble since she was 13.
The UF junior gymnast had suffered stress 
fractures before, and the remedy was six weeks off, like clockwork, and then a return to gym-nastics.
There were those stress fractures, with suck-
it-up pain, and then there was the rod, a new beast that took months to get over.
“I had been hurt before, but still nothing like 
this,” Smith said.
Burning to be a Bruin
Smith graduated high school early to be a 
Bruins gymnast. The Placerville, Calif., native started at UCLA the first week of January 2006.
Everything seemed to be fine until the tum-
bling pass that fractured her shin.
“I felt, like, a really hot, fiery pain in my leg,” 
Smith said. “I didn’t think anything of it, just, ‘Aw, my shin hurts,’ as it normally does.”
It may have hurt, but she toughed it out. She 
competed in UCLA’s first two meets of the sea-son before the pain became unbearable. 
“But after the second meet I was like, ‘Oh 
man, something is definitely wrong,’” Smith said. “You could see it on the X-ray, just a big 
slash in my leg. … (The doctors) were like, ‘If 
you take one wrong landing, your leg can break in half,’ so that’s why I was just done.”
She had the dreaded black line on her X-ray, 
indicating a larger-than-normal stress fracture.Suddenly the biggest question on Smith’s 
mind wasn’t where in the lineup she’d compete, it was whether she would ever compete again.
“I basically tried talking her into retiring 
then,” said Smith’s mother, Patty. “Or even just 
maybe considering being (an uneven) bar spe-
cialist and not going on with the surgery.”
Even Smith was surprised at the severity 
of the injury. She figured it was another stress fracture that would heal after a couple of weeks off.
So she sat out for a month and had an X-ray. 
No change.
Another month, another X-ray. No change.
Another month still, another X-ray. Still no 
change.
Every month from January to June, Smith 
had an X-ray to see if anything had healed only 
to find no change whatsoever.
She was then presented with three choices: 
take more time off and hope her shin healed naturally, get the rod put in or quit the sport altogether. 
So in June, after six months of no healing, 
she decided to have the surgery.
“I hadn’t given up on the sport yet,” Smith 
said. “I still really wanted to do it. I’ll do any-thing to compete again, so I chose the surgery route.”
A Month of Hell
“I remember my mom, the day of the sur-
gery, she was like, ‘You don’t have to get it. Do you realize it’s not going to be easy?’” Smith said. “And I was like, ‘No, I want to get it, be-cause I want to do gym again. I’m tired of just waiting.’”
Smith thought it would be a quick fix.She couldn’t have been more wrong.
“When they talked about putting a titanium 
rod down her shin, I was speculating it was go-
ing to be pretty bad,” Patty said. “I don’t think she realized how intensive of a surgery it was going to be.”
Patty remembers the night before the sur-
gery. Staying in a Los Angeles hotel, she spent 24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 2, 2009
