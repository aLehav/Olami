By only 127 votes, Helen Warren 
beat Annie Orlando for a spot on the City Commission in Tuesday night’s runoff election.  
Warren and supporters took 
the celebration to Tall Paul’s Brew House after results rolled in. She thanked those involved in the cam-
paign, then took a moment to praise 
the voters.
“All I need are the good and 
the smart voters,” Warren told the 
crowd. “So we had 127 more of them 
on our side.”
As results came in at the Supervi-
sor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce, Orlando was 
initially leading with 56.2 percent. When early and absentee votes came in, the tide shifted, and Warren held on to a small lead. The ﬁ  nal returns showed Warren received 50.59 percent of the votes, and Orlando earned 49.41 percent.
In the city’s runoff election held 
last year, Ed Braddy defeated Craig Lowe for mayor by 1,251 votes. 
Once in ofﬁ  ce, Warren said her 
ﬁ  rst order of business will be tack-ling the city budget.

From frosted tips to a zebra suit or a new tattoo, des-
perate Dance Marathon participants will do just about 
anything to earn money for a good cause.
Students involved in Dance Marathon at UF have 
promised to do wacky things for donations from friends, family or anyone willing to support them. 
Participants have been busy employing these new 
fundraising tactics in anticipation of the event’s 20th an-niversary this weekend, when more than 800 students will stay awake and on their feet for 26.2 hours to sym-bolically raise awareness of children who live with seri-ous illnesses 24/7. One of the ways dancers raise money 
is by getting pledges before the event.
Maria Mandese, a morale captain for Dance Mara-
thon, said fundraising isn’t always easy.
“It can be scary asking your friends and family for 
money, especially when they know nothing about Dance 
Marathon,” said the 20-year-old UF health science sopho-more.
Volunteers created a Facebook page to give the stu-
dents involved ideas on raising money. Examples include 
hosting a bowling night, a ﬂ  ash mob on Turlington Plaza  
and a family-oriented carnival. 
However, these mainstream methods weren’t enough 
for some participants.
Mandese used a tactic she called the incentive meth-
od. She cleaned a friend’s room as an incentive for her to give a donation. Then she took the idea further.
“I said if I could reach $1,000 in a certain time period, 
then I would wear a zebra costume around campus,” she Dancers get

Gainesville Police is looking for a man suspected of steal-
ing another man’s iPad on West University Avenue on Tues-
day afternoon.
A UF Alert sent out to students, staff and faculty at about 
4 p.m. reported the following incident:At about 3:15 p.m., the victim met a man at 1423 W. Uni-
versity Ave. to buy the victim’s iPad. It is not conﬁ  rmed if the victim is a UF student, GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said. 
During the exchange, the man said he didn’t have his wal-
let and ﬂ  ed with the victim’s iPad.
The suspect is described as a tall, black male in his 20s with 
a medium build. He was wearing a black shirt, red pants and athletic shoes.
The victim did not say in which direction the man ran. He-licopters on daily patrols at the time assisted in the search.

tect their possessions. Students can register their bikes and other valuables through the department. For computer safety, students can install Front Door Software, which allows users to remotely lock their laptops.

More than 600 colleges across 
the U.S. are participating in Na-
tional Alcohol Screening Day this Thursday as part of National Al-cohol Awareness Month, but UF 
is not among them.
The 17th annual screening 
day is promoted by Screening for 
Mental Health, a nonprofit orga-nization that aims to provide men-tal health and substance abuse resources to those who need it. Although UF isn’t participating this year, colleges that take part 
in the screening day offer free 
anonymous in-person and online assessments for students to help indicate alcohol problems, said Sue Thorn, Screening for Mental Health representative.  
UF doesn’t have plans to par-
ticipate in the screening day this year, but it is a possibility for the 
future, said Julia Varnes, a health 
promotion specialist at Gator-Well. 
“We are constantly re-evaluat-
ing our efforts and making revi-sions to programming to ensure that we are meeting UF student needs,” she said.
Thorn said it is important to 
get colleges involved with the screening day because there are skewed perceptions among stu-dents about how much and how often their peers consume alco-hol.
“Our goal … is to link those 
in need with quality treatment 
resources on or off campus,” she said.
Samantha Rowland, a 21-
year-old UF Chinese junior, said 
she thinks offering free alco-hol screenings on UF’s campus would be beneficial to the Stu-dent Body.           
“It would help some people 
realize that they have a problem, and once they realize that, they can take steps to fix it,” Rowland said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2014

The new Austin Cary Learning Center, 
dedicated Saturday, will provide space for 
weddings, club meetings and nature-relat-
ed activities. 
The center replaced the original, which 
was destroyed in a fire three years ago. 
The 7,800-square-foot building is located 
6 miles northeast of Gainesville on Waldo Road, overlooking Lake Mize and in the 
Austin Cary Forest.
Tim White, director of the School of For-
est Resources and Conservation, said the facility is used for everything from club meetings to weddings. He said UF’s forest-ry students go to the center to experience nature.
“There are forested areas with great trails 
as well as Lake Mize, which is one of the deepest lakes in Florida,” he said. “While here, they can also learn about the impor-tant role that forests play in our lives.”
He said the new center is twice the size and has more functionality than the old one. The center now has access to the Inter-net, breakout rooms and a kitchen.
The center’s floor plan was based on sur-
veys from people around the community, White said.
The $2 million center was funded entire-
ly by donations. White said donations came from alumni, private companies and other sources. People gave anywhere from $50 to $150,000.
Michelle Franklin, a 26-year-old UF for-
est resources and conservation senior, has been working at the Austin Cary Forest for a year and watched the construction of the new facility. She wrote in an email that she and the other seniors are jealous of the stu-dents who get to use the new facility.
“It doesn’t feel like a building when you 
step inside,” Franklin said. “It feels like a home, and I am excited to share it with oth-ers.”New nature learning center opens in Austin Cary Forest

Liesel Appel’s birth was 
dedicated to Adolf Hitler, but 
her life was not.
Appel was born in 1941 
in Klingenberg, Germany, 
to Nazi criminals who made 
their dedication to the German leader official at a ceremony when she was 2 weeks old. At the age of 9, she decided she could not be one of them.
“I was taught such a dead-
ly culture that it still blows my mind,” she told a crowd of 
about 40 gathered at UF Hillel 
on Tuesday night.
“Everything about me 
must be offensive,” the blue-eyed blonde said. “My accent … the tone of my voice, the way I look.” 
A converted Jew, the 73-
year-old has spent her lifetime 
searching for forgiveness — especially from Jewish neigh-
bors whose businesses were ransacked during the Holo-caust as her parents watched in support.
Appel has told her story on 
radio and television, at educa-tional seminars and countless Holocaust Memorial services across the world.
Hillel, located at 2020 W. 
University Ave., paid her $200 for the speech as part of its genocide awareness week. 
Campaign chairwoman 
Rachael Cain, a 20-year-old UF music junior, said Appel’s story provides an alternative view to the traditional survi-vor’s saga.
“In any given situation, a 
bigger problem is the popula-tion that stands by and watch-
es it happen,” she said.
Appel said the time to 
stand up for those in need is 
now.
“Courage does not have to 
be loud,” she said. “It often is the quiet voice of reason.”Daughter of Nazis

One leader said he’d get an ‘FTK’ tattoo if he reached his goal
said. “I guess a lot of people want to see me walk around as 
a zebra because I got quite a few donations (after that) and reached the goal.”
DM morale overall director Joelle Waksman said she has 
heard of even more drastic incentives.
“A community events captain pledged to tattoo ‘FTK’ once 
he hit his fundraising goal,” she said.But Waksman said despite their oddities, these tactics have 
proven to be extremely successful. She recalled a student who posted a picture of himself with a “frosted tips” hairstyle.
“He promised to dye the tips of his hair blonde if he could 
reach his goal in a certain amount of time,” she said.  “Within a few hours, he hit his goal.”
In 2013, DM at UF raised a record $1.1 million. This year’s 
fundraising total will be revealed at the event’s closing cer-emonies, and students are hoping to break the record once more.
But for passionate participants like Mandese, this year’s 
Dance Marathon will be memorable either way.
“Look out for the zebra at the end of this week,” she said.dAnce , from page 1
Orlando criticized Warren’s campaign for name-calling tactics
of political affiliation,” she said. 
Warren received advice and support on 
her campaign from outgoing City Com-
missioner Susan Bottcher. 
Bottcher, who will step down from her 
seat in May after losing this year’s election to Craig Carter, came Tuesday to support Warren on her win. Bottcher said she is looking forward to 
sharing her experiences and insight with Warren.
“This is probably one of the best things 
to happen in a city election in a very long time,” she said. 
Orlando and her supporters gathered at 
The Warehouse Restaurant & Lounge after the release of the results, which they called an unexpected loss.“I thought we had the momentum,” Or-
lando said. 
Despite the results, Orlando said she is 
proud of her campaign. 
She criticized Warren and her support-
ers for name-calling.
“They went to the dirty tricks and the 
nasty campaigning to smear my reputa-tion,” Orlando said. “They were saying I was the Tea Party candidate, and I’m still a Democrat whether they like it or not.” 
As for the Commission’s future, Orlan-
do said it’s up in the air.
“I have very grave concerns with what’s 
going to happen with GRU,” she said. 
Warren, who will take office in May, 
said she hopes to unify the city. 
“We won. I’m saying we won,” she told 
her supporters. “And I hope Gainesville will see what they won.”elections , from page 1“It feels like a home, and I am

Tuesday night’s Senate meeting 
was all about the money.
Senators voted to pass two bills 
with proposed budgets for second 
readings. The ﬁ  rst bill allocated 
money for the Student Government-
funded organizational budget, and the second allocated money for the SG-funded academic budget.  
Sen. Davis Bean, chairman of the 
budget and appropriations com-mittee, said a new element of the organizational budget could award additional funding to organizations 
that spent 90 percent of their previ-
ous budgets. Senators will push the measure to a vote next meeting. 
Bean said 13 organizations will 
receive an additional $500 while two others will receive $250.
“With the money that was left 
over … we took that money and de-cided to allocate it equally to these 
organizations that were ﬁ  scally re-
sponsible,” Bean said.
Certain aspects of the budget sparked controversy.    
In pro-con debate, Sen. Michael 
Christ said he disagreed with both 
of the budget bills.  
Christ said his main issues with 
the organizational budget bill were 
increased funding allocated for food and the monetary rewards for ﬁ  s-cally responsible groups.
“I don’t think having a really 
good expenditure rate … justiﬁ  es giving more money,” Christ said. 
As for food, Christ said he doesn’t 
want SG to “turn into a food-subsi-dization group.”
Five senators spoke during the 
pro portion of the debate, and each put their support behind the budget as proposed. 
Sen. Susan Webster said the re-
sponsible organizations deserve ex-
tra money.
“By giving these organizations 
who have great expenditure rates 
extra money, we are able to help those organizations put on more and better events,” she said.
Sen. Austin Sherman said he 
supported the line items providing organizations with money for food.
“I think food is vital to student 
orgs ... to outreach,” Sherman said. WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

With a $75 million endowment and a new 
teaching hall, UF’s Warrington College of 
Business Administration is making positive changes — but a new Bloomberg Business-week ranking says otherwise. 
The ranking, which came out Friday, slated 
Warrington at 44 out of 132 undergraduate business colleges in the nation. The college dropped seven spots from its 2013 rank of 37. Bloomberg also graded the college’s teaching at a C and its facilities at a B. Horace Tucker, the associate director of 
the Heavener School of Business, wrote in an email that, because of the ranking’s methodol-ogy, it’s difﬁ  cult to determine why the college dropped.
Bloomberg surveys students and employ-
ers, which count for 50 percent of the metrics used. That’s information that the college is not aware of until it’s published with the rankings. 
Also taken into consideration is academic 
quality, median salary and how many under-graduate students advance to top-graduate programs. 
“This ebb and ﬂ  ow in the rankings hap-pens,” Tucker said. “We are conﬁ  dent that we are moving in the right direction.” 
This is the second time the college dropped 
seven spots. The ﬁ  rst occurred in 2009, when it moved from 46 to 53. The college bottomed out at 55 in 2010 and began climbing the ranks to 37 in 2013. 
Although the college’s upward trend has 
been interrupted, students like 20-year-old UF economics junior Alex Mazur aren’t worried.  
Mazur said colleges are becoming more 
competitive with ranking systems, and War-rington is going through a transitional period. 
Regardless of ranking, Mazur said the col-
lege has given her tools to create a career. 
“Warrington has deﬁ  nitely set me up for 
success in terms of entering the real world,” she said.Business college falls in Bloomberg ranking despite investments
“This ebb and ﬂ  ow in the

Florida e-cig bill 
sparks debate
The debate about whether e-cigarettes should be sold to mi-
nors in Florida is, as one might guess, a love story between Big Tobacco and a lucrative market: teens with money to 
burn.  
Pushing the obvious aside — that minors shouldn’t have ac-
cess to tobacco — fresh conﬂ  ict arose this week when the Ameri-can Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association opposed a bill that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to Floridians younger than 18. 
The Tampa Bay Times reported that the anti-smoking orga-
nizations originally weren’t against the proposal but “became outraged when state lawmakers added language that would go farther, stripping local governments’ ability to regulate the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products.”
The chief operating ofﬁ  cer of the American Lung Associa-
tion of Florida blamed Big Tobacco for attempting to sneak its inﬂ  uence in the sale of e-cigarettes by pressuring lawmakers to change the proposed bill’s language. 
And it’s not surprising: According to the Times, the National 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that between 2011 and 2012, the number of middle and high schoolers using e-cigarettes doubled. The use of e-cigarettes among kids today isn’t some esoteric, made-up-by-TV-news trend like vodka eye-
balling or drinking hand sanitizer. The reality is, more and more 
underage boys and girls are getting their hands on tobacco.
The language problem in the bill boils down to power. The 
original bill prohibiting the sale of e-cigs to kids younger than 18 didn’t restrict the power of local governments to regulate sales.  Last month, a provision was added to the House version origi-nally proposed in October to strip governments’ power when it came to regulating e-cigarette-related commerce. 
Lawmakers who support the bill say it’s part of an effort to 
standardize tobacco-regulation practices in Florida, but no one anticipated the blowback from health organizations. 
The speciﬁ  c part of the updated language that worries anti-
smoking organizations the most is its potential to “override ex-isting municipal ordinances,” the Times reported.
“Compounding their concern: the language applies to the sale 
of all tobacco products, not just electronic cigarettes,” the Times reported. “While only a handful of local governments have ordi-nances restricting the sales or use of electronic cigarettes, dozens 
have ordinances regarding the sale of tobacco products.”
The bottom line in this back-and-forth is less about concern 
over teens accessing tobacco and more about preserving the 
power of local governments in Florida. It’s reasonable that the cancer, heart and lung associations would be concerned over the shift in authority from municipalities to the state when it comes to e-cigarette sale: The tobacco industry has “long had a power-ful presence in Tallahassee,” the Times reported. 
Though lawmakers deny the tobacco industry’s involvement 
with the language change, we’re with the American cancer, 
heart and lung associations on this one. 
Florida, keep e-cigs out of the hands of fedora-wearing, Kurt-
Vonnegut-reading youths.McCutcheon ruling hurts US democracy
On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court hammered a 
new nail into the cofﬁ  n of American democracy with its ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Com-
mission. In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court eliminated restrictions on the total amount of money individual donors 
can give to political parties and candidates in a given elec-
tion cycle.
Before the ruling in McCutcheon, wealthy donors such 
as the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson had to conduct most of their political activity through super PACs. These organizations could spend unlimited amounts on political advertising, as long as they did not coordinate directly with any political candidate.
Now, as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision, “elect-
ed politicians are able to request the contributions directly from the high-net-worth donor,” according to a memo by corporate lobbying ﬁ  rm Covington & Burling quoted in The New York Times. 
The Supreme Court ruled that these massive campaign 
contributions do not have the potential to facilitate political corruption or even the “appearance of corruption.” 
This opinion is further evidence that the conservative ma-
jority of the Supreme Court is completely out of touch with 
the interests and values of the American people.
A 2013 Gallup poll showed 79 percent of Americans in its 
sample supported restrictions on campaign contributions to 
House and Senate candidates. The same poll showed that 50 percent would support a publicly funded campaign ﬁ  nance system with private contributions completely eliminated.
These polls clearly indicate that the majority of the Amer-
ican people understand that unlimited campaign contribu-tions by wealthy donors have a severe and corrosive effect 
on our political institutions and our democracy.
The McCutcheon ruling expands and institutionalizes 
the American campaign ﬁ  nance system of legalized bribery. 
Our elected ofﬁ  cials and political parties are now for sale to the highest bidder. 
The end result of the unraveling of these campaign ﬁ  nance 
restrictions is obvious: Elected ofﬁ  cials and political candi-dates will direct their efforts toward serving their wealthy donors who will ultimately deter-mine which candidates succeed and which fail. Although it is true that both Democrats and Repub-licans depend on wealthy donors 
to ensure their political survival, 
the GOP has expressed far greater enthusiasm for the opportunity to be bribed by these moneyed inter-ests.
The Republican National Committee was listed as a 
plaintiff in the McCutcheon case, and Senate Minority Lead-er Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., ﬁ  led an amicus brief in the case encouraging the Supreme Court to eliminate the campaign 
ﬁ  nance restrictions.
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, one of the four lib-
eral justices who dissented from the Supreme Court’s ruling, 
explained the effect of money on politics in a clear and suc-cinct way: “Where enough money calls the tune, the general public will not be heard.”
Although the Supreme Court upheld the $2,600 limit for 
a donation to an individual candidate and has yet to address the ban on direct contributions by corporations and unions, 
future cases could result in these restrictions being struck 
down as well. 
Campaign ﬁ  nance should not be a liberal or a conserva-
tive issue. All Americans who care about having their voices heard should be outraged at the purchasing of our democ-racy by wealthy interests.
The policies enacted by the federal government should 
not be determined by the whims of billionaires or by multi-national corporations. Laws should be passed based on their 
levels of public support and their beneﬁ  ts to the American 
people, not on massive amounts of campaign donations.  
Until a constitutional amendment is passed to institute 
public ﬁ  nancing of elections, our politicians will continue to ignore the needs and desires of the American people in favor of the interest of their wealthy donors.

The recent, tragic de-
velopments in the Israel-Palestine con-
ﬂ  ict are always front-page news. The struggles of the European Union offer promising articles. And 
for some reason, the me-
dia seems to be getting a kick out of the fact that all undergraduates in North Korea must cut their hair like that of their supreme 
leader, Kim Jong Un. I guess that’s what 
it takes to sell papers these days.  
But when reading about interna-
tional affairs, it is unbelievable to think 
about the present state of the human 
condition around the world. It is mind-numbing to realize how much war, unrest and poverty there is in our tech-nologically advanced modern world. It 
pains me to ponder what the life a stu-
dent my age in a war-torn part of the world — say, Syria, Somalia or Sudan — must be like. 
The New York Times covered elec-
tions in Afghanistan thoroughly, and to no surprise, the country is still rocked with religious oppression and gen-eral strife. In an article, a quote from a 
young woman discussing the condition 
of women in her home country made an impression on me. 
She said that in the recent past, “A 
woman wouldn’t even show her face to her brother-in-law living in the same house for 25 years. … People would joke that if someone kidnapped our la-dies, we would have to ﬁ  nd them from 
their voices.”
Americans — myself included 
— take our country for granted. Our 
daily worries and gripes abjectly pale 
in comparison to what our fellow men 
and women in other countries have to endure every day. It is a humbling feel-ing to contemplate this, and it begs the question: Am I truly trying to make a 
difference in this world? 
To be a bit cynical, we have a lot to work with.  
Think about this for a 
moment: Most of us at UF reading this newspaper 
were probably fortunate enough to win the birth lottery. We were born to 
the right parents in the 
right country. The lottery is something none of us 
can control. Its results are completely arbitrary. A reader of this article could 
have been born to parents in Mozam-
bique instead of in Miami. If we were born of different circumstances, as this hypothetical suggests, how would we 
react to a world completely ignorant of 
our present situation? How would we handle living in the poorest of poor and most illiterate of places on Earth? 
When you think about this, the 
world does not seem as big as it once did. Every person on this planet shares a common human experience though our human condition may be complete-
ly different.     
As reasonable and compassionate 
human beings, we are supposed to be 
our brothers’ keepers. I am not saying it is the responsibility of our country 
or government to intervene on other 
people’s behalf or send scores of money in foreign aid to each distraught coun-try. Instead, I am imploring us, as the 
future of the country and the world, to 
care about the condition of everyone on this planet. 
We may be miles apart, but in this 
modern era, everyone is interwoven. 
One person’s actions hundreds of miles 
away from our shores might have a lasting impact on us. As young people, we have the unique ability to change 
the world as we see ﬁ  t. The question is 
whether we will actually do that. 
And only we can make that deci-
sion.

Valens Nteziyaremye can’t go 
home to the family awaiting his re-
turn. 
In the two years he has spent 
apart from them, he has missed 
birthdays and weddings. He has 
created a life they may never see.
The soft-spoken 26-year-old 
can’t afford to visit his family in Rwanda, so he’s saving up.
Before arriving at UF, Valens 
was one of more than a thousand students who traveled to the U.S. as part of the Rwanda Presidential 
Scholars Program. In collaboration 
with the Rwandan government and U.S. universities, the program pro-vides undergraduate scholarships to Rwanda’s brightest students.  
Through the program, Valens 
completed his undergraduate de-gree in mechanical engineering at the University of Arkansas at Little 
Rock in 2012.
Before making the more than 16-
hour trek to Arkansas with 25 other 
students, Valens underwent a rigor-ous selection process. Even with his 
high national examination scores, 
he still had to pass a round of inter-
views and prove his English skills.
His mother’s belief in him led 
Valens to become one of the top students in Rwanda, he said.  
“She told me, ‘School will be 
your future,’” he said. “My par-ents didn’t even have a high school degree. I said ‘I’m going to get the education my parents didn’t have the chance to get.’”
Valens lost his mother at age 12, 
after a time when war and genocide had changed Rwanda.
This month marks the 20th anni-
versary of the killing spree Valens and his siblings lived through.
During the chaos in 1994, Va-
lens and his family ﬂ  ed to a refugee camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
During his four years in the 
camp, Valens attended a makeshift school. Sitting atop rocks, he fol-lowed along as the teacher used charcoal and cardboard for daily lessons.
Valens entered the camp at age 
7 and left four years later to return to Rwanda, where 800,000 people died. With the help of his older brother, Valens watched over his four siblings, the youngest of whom had just turned 1.
At UF, Valens, a mechanical and 
aerospace engineering Ph.D. candi-
date, has not stopped supporting 
his siblings.
He uses any extra money to pay 
for his siblings’ schooling in Rwan-da.
“If I don’t do it, I don’t think 
anyone else will do it,” he said.
The UF fellowship student is 
working on a National Science 
Foundation-funded project on 
breast cancer biopsy needles, mak-ing them more efﬁ  cient and reduc-ing the pain to the patient.
Caring for others comes natural-
ly to Valens, said Hitomi Yamagu-chi Greenslet, UF associate profes-sor in the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering.
Greenslet oversees Valens’ work 
on the needle project and assigned him as a mentor for high school stu-dents.
“He has a lot of difﬁ  culties back 
home,” she said. “He knows how to deal with his personal and profes-sional life.”
Valens’ start at UF came with a 
loneliness he did not have in Arkan-sas. When he arrived in Gainesville, he no longer had a group of Rwan-dan friends he could relate to.
David Worthington Hahn, pro-
fessor and chairman in the depart-
ment of mechanical and aerospace 
engineering, said Valens’ transition to UF was a bit difﬁ  cult.
“He came here, and he was on 
his own,” Hahn said. “He always impressed me with his smile and his outlook. Anyone who spends time with him can’t help but like him.”
It was during the ﬁ  rst year that 
Valens experienced a night that challenged his positive outlook on life.
Valens was driving back home 
after meeting with his academic adviser when he was pulled over. He said the ofﬁ  cers could not un-derstand him, and an argument ensued. Valens was then arrested but released shortly after with no charges.
“The guy — he chose to stop me 
because he thought I looked sus-
picious,” he said. “It’s not the ﬁ  rst 
time it’s happened, though.”
When most UF students went 
home for Christmas break to spend time with their families, Valens spent his time working in the re-search lab. One night, as he was rid-ing on his bike from work, Valens was stopped by a cop. He said the 
ofﬁ  cer told him that he looked like a 
black man they were searching for. “That’s how it is,” Valens said.
But Valens is too busy to worry 
about his past troubles. He often 
tries not to stray too far from his re-search lab.  Valens said he believes he can overcome anything  with hard work and prayer.
“There was time I thought about 
giving up everything I was doing,” he said. “But I said, ‘What am I go-
ing to do after I give up?’ That’s 
what keeps me going.”
When he needs to talk, Valens’ 
roommate is there to listen  — ex-cept  English is often not a part of their conversation. They speak their native language of Kinyarwanda instead.
Valens’ roommate, Olivier Nsen-
giyumva, a 24-year-old UF Ph.D. candidate, arrived in Gainesville from Oklahoma Christian Univer-sity in August. In Oklahoma, Ol-ivier, like Valens, participated in the Rwanda Presidential Scholars Pro-gram. Before becoming roommates, Olivier and Valens attended the same high school and were only ac-
quaintances. It took travelling more 
than 7,500 miles from Rwanda to make them close friends. 
Olivier said he can’t believe how 
far the two of them have come.
“It’s like a dream come true,” he 
said.
Valens has two more years at UF 
before graduating with his Ph.D.
He said his dad doesn’t under-
stand what a Ph.D. is. He just wants his son to come home soon.
“My dad is always saying, 
‘When you are going to graduate?’” he said.
For now, Valens wants to start 
helping his home country. 
He’s launching an organization, 
called Nature of Life, with a friend back in Rwanda to reduce poverty one donation at a time. 
“I’ve been given the chance to do 
what I’m doing, so I need to help,” he said.  “You have to go through some difﬁ  cult times before you achieve something.”

STATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Some Florida legisla-
tors are making a push again this year to end 
a requirement that greyhound dog tracks have on-site races if they want to keep card games and other betting options.
Florida has 12 tracks that currently fea-
ture greyhound racing, but legislators and some animal activists contend that racing is harmful to the dogs.
“We need to free the greyhounds from this senseless activity of racing,” said Sen. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood.
But despite the support 
of some top lawmakers, 
the proposal stalled in a 
Senate committee on Tues-day. Instead, the panel 
passed a stripped-down bill sponsored by Sobel 
that requires dog tracks around the state to report all injuries of racing greyhounds.Most of Florida’s current dog tracks 
make money off other types of gambling, in-cluding off-track betting, poker rooms and slot machines in South Florida. But state law requires the tracks to have a full schedule of 
races each year in order to keep their gam-
bling permits.
Sen. Maria Sachs, D-Boca Raton, tried to 
get the Senate Gaming Committee to pass a provision that would end the racing re-quirement and allow tracks to decide if they wanted to keep scheduling races.She said she dropped the effort after 
questions arose over whether the wording would allow currently shuttered tracks to reopen.
Other senators on the panel, however, 
said it was clear there weren’t enough votes to pass the proposal in its current form.
The greyhound bill is the only major 
gambling measure that remains alive after lawmakers pulled the plug on a comprehen-sive bill that would have allowed resort ca-sinos in South Florida.

On Tuesday night, teams of 
super heroes, police ofﬁ  cers and 
football players gobbled as many wings as their stomachs could han-dle in fewer than ﬁ  ve minutes.
Six teams of two took down buckets of wings, leaving the table-tops and chairs in Splitz Bowling Center a sticky, orange mess.
The winning team ate 74 wings 
between members Kyle Myers and Scott Arvin in 10 minutes. Each 
team member had ﬁ  ve minutes to 
stuff his face.
An eating team comprised of 
football players ate a total of 69 wings, coming in second place.
 “My method is to grab as many 
ﬂ  ats as I can,” said David Young, previous UF offensive lineman. Flats are wings with two bones in them, he said.
Tuesday night’s eating was for a 
good cause. It was the third annual Wing Bowl eating competition to 
raise funds for the Child Advocacy 
Group.
All proceeds will go toward the 
nonproﬁ  t’s support and therapy services for abused children, said Sherry Kitchens, the group’s CEO and founder.The competition was an inter-
esting way to get the community involved, Kitchens said. 
“Folks get super excited,” she 
said.
Craig Wilburn, the creator of 
the Wing Bowl and broker for Bosshardt Realty, came up with the event to raise awareness of the Child Advocacy Group. He said touring the group’s center had an emotional impact on him.
“I went to visit the center, and I 
couldn’t even ﬁ  nish the tour, “ Wil-burn said. “I didn’t even know this was going on in Gainesville.”
He said he wants to get the word 
out for next year’s event to raise even more money for the cause.

TALLAHASSEE — Florida 
State students arrived two hours 
before the game to get a ticket. 
They sat throughout Dick Howser 
Stadium and filled the right-field bleachers to capacity. 
By the eighth inning, the 
bleachers were deserted. No. 15 Florida (21-12, 7-5 Southeastern Conference) swept its season se-ries against No. 1 Florida State (26-6, 12-2 Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence) in an emphatic 8-0 shutout 
that sent the majority of a sold-out crowd of 6,514 heading to the exits early.
Florida defeated Florida State 
in all three games this season for the second time in coach Kevin O’Sullivan’s seven-year tenure at UF. The first time was in 2012. 
Left-hander Danny Young, who 
earned the win with five innings of work, pushed his scoreless-in-nings streak to 15. 
Freshman John Sternagel sin-
gled home Peter Alonso in the fifth inning for Florida’s first run that ended the night for FSU start-er Billy Strode. Casey Turgeon fol-
lowed with a three-run home run 
off sidearm reliever Gage Smith that almost reached the circus tent beyond right field. The Gators 
got on the Seminoles early and 
wouldn’t let up.
“It was unbelievable. I know 
Gage Smith has got some really good numbers. He just dropped 
the head on it and we went up four to zero,” catcher Taylor Gushue 
said. “That was the end of the sto-ry I feel like. That was definitely the turning point of the game.”
Gushue had it partially right. 
Turgeon’s home run was one of the key moments from Tuesday night. 
There was Casey Smit leading 
off the game for FSU with a single past a diving Zack Powers at first base and advancing to second base on a pitch in the dirt by Young, 
setting up a sacrifice bunt. Smit 
froze on Justin Gonzalez’s attempt and never reached third base. He didn’t try scoring from third on a 
wild pitch from Young two at-bats 
later — he would’ve been safe. 
“I was pretty relieved when 
I picked up the ball and saw he was still at second,” Young said. 
“I’ll be honest. I saw it and I was 
like, ‘Alright I got away with one there.’”
Young pitched his 10th-straight 
appearance without surrendering a run and has tossed 11.2 shutout innings against Florida State this year.
Florida would have ran out of 
its four-run rally in the fifth had freshman Ryan Larson not bailed out Zack Powers, who was picked off at second by Florida State 
catcher Danny De La Calle. Pow-
ers pumped his fists in disgust as third-base coach Craig Bell low-ered his head. 
Larson, who was sacrifice bun-
ting, ended up singling into right field, advancing Peter Alonso to second base.After De La Calle picked Mar-
tin off at first base with one out two batters later, the UF coaches pulled the team together and 
asked them to stop playing so 
tight. 
They listened, adding one run 
in the sixth on a wild pitch and 
three runs in the eighth on three hits and two FSU errors. 
Florida silenced the 12th-larg-
est crowd in Florida State history. With continued success versus top-
10 teams, it will be making more noise in the national spotlight. But it doesn’t get any easier — Florida 
starts a road series against No. 2 
South Carolina on Friday before finishing its eight-game road trip on Tuesday against Florida Gulf Coast. “We knew this would be a 
tough part of the schedule,” O’Sullivan said. 
“To come up here and get the 
third win against Florida State, who has obviously got a great pro-gram, it’s a great accomplishment 
for our team. This weekend will 
be another new challenge for us. Obviously, they’re excited right now, but we’ve got another chal-lenge ahead of us this weekend.”

Kathlyn Medina wasn’t in the starting 
lineup when UF dropped its first contest to 
FSU on April 2.
In fact, prior to Florida’s series against 
Auburn, the junior shortstop had not started 
since UF’s second game against Ole Miss on 
March 8 — a span of 15 games.
“One of the main reasons I took Katie out 
for a bit was just because I didn’t feel like we were getting the shortstop leadership that she’s capable of,” coach Tim Walton said.
Kelsey Stewart replaced Medina at short-
stop for those games, and freshman Chelsea Herndon took Stewart’s spot at second base.
But after being given 
the opportunity to start in the Gators’ series against the Tigers, Medina did not 
disappoint.
“Seeing my name up 
there, I was more than ex-cited to do what I can for 
the team,” Medina said. “I’m just trying to do what I can to get the outs.”
Medina hopes to keep her performance 
up when No. 6 Florida (34-8, 8-7 Southeast-ern Conference) plays No. 8 Florida State (38-4, 15-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) to-night at 6 in Tallahassee.
With the Gators riding a three-game win-
ning streak heading into its rematch with the 
Seminoles, Medina said the team is prepared 
for the game.
“I definitely think the momentum will 
help us out,” Medina said. “I mean, we’re not overlooking FSU. We definitely need to go out there and perform. They’re a great team, so it’s going to be a great game. We’re just going in there with a good mentality and trying to get that win.” 
The Downey, Calif., native made key plays 
on defense throughout the series against Au-burn this past weekend. She helped Florida sweep its first SEC series since it won three straight against Ole Miss in March 2013 and showed Walton that she is capable of hold-ing down the defense.
“This weekend was probably the best our 
infield’s played all season long,” Walton said. “Taking Katie out of the lineup [earlier in the season] wasn’t necessarily what I wanted to do, but it had to be done at the time and the way she’s responded and coming back, she’s basically playing like her pants are on fire.”
Medina made the play of the game dur-
ing Florida’s 1-0 extra inning win to cap off 
the series against Auburn on Sunday.

After a 13th-place finish at 
the Chris Schenkel Invitational 
on March 14-16, coach Buddy Alexander expressed his disap-pointment in Florida’s lack of 
improvement.
The Gators responded to their 
coach by finishing in fourth place, 
scoring 866 (+2) at the two-day Old Waverly Collegiate Champi-onship in West Point, Miss. Their finish in their regular-season finale marked their best of the spring season and second best of 
the year.
Tournament host Mississippi 
State won the first-place trophy 
with a total score of 859 (-5). Bar-rett Edens of Mississippi State and Marco Iten of Austin Peay shared the individual honor, each shooting 207 (-9).
“Probably our best tourna-
ment of the year in terms of con-sistency,” Alexander said in a release. 
“All five guys were kind of in 
every round at least to a certain extent. I thought that was a posi-tive. We actually were in the golf tournament to a certain degree as well, just could never get any real momentum going to make a move up the leaderboard, but we hung in there pretty well.”
There was no doubt that J.D. 
Tomlinson was in every round. The junior shot even par in 
the first round and two-under in both Rounds 2 and 3, ending the tournament with a 212 (-4) and a tie for fifth place. Tomlinson’s under-par score was his second 
straight, and it was his third top-
five finish of the season.
“J.D. is having a solid year, 
and he’s a solid player,” Alex-ander said. “It doesn’t appear to me as though there’s a lot in his game that should ever go bad.”
Fellow junior Eric Banks fin-
ished just outside the top 10 in 
a tie for 13th place. He shot even 
par overall, totaling 216 strokes with rounds of 69, 73 and 74.
Ryan Orr’s best round was 
his last, when he shot 70 (-2) after first and second rounds of 76 and 74. He finished four over par at 220 and in a tie for 28th place.
Richard Donegan and Victor 
Tarnstrom tied one another for 41st place, sharing a score of 222 (+6). 
Donegan shot rounds of 73, 76 
and 73, while Tarnstrom gradu-ally improved with rounds of 75, 74 and 73.
This showing marks a huge 
positive for the Gators heading 
into the Southeastern Conference 
Championship at the end of the month and a sign of improve-ment in Alexander’s eyes.
“Again, I see this team im-
proving, and unfortunately, we just ran out of time,” he said.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2014

Coach Will Muschamp preaches 
strength to all of his linemen, but 
with less than a week left in spring practice, there are weaknesses on both sides of the line of scrimmage. 
Muschamp had remainders from 
former coach Urban Meyer’s recruit-ing classes — Dominique Easley and Sharrif Floyd — anchor the line for a part of his first three seasons, but going into season No. 4, many of the positions of his defensive line are currently undetermined.
“Too much separation right now 
still on both lines of scrimmage when you talk in terms of when that first group comes out,” Muschamp said at a Tuesday press conference. “We have too much of a separation between the first and second group. I think the talent is there. I think the quality of player is there. It’s just consistency in the performance has 
got to pick up.”
Muschamp said he would feel 
comfortable with between eight 
and 10 players in a defensive-line rotation, but he doesn’t think some of his players have reached the level they are capable of yet.
“Caleb (Brantley) shows flashes, 
but he’s got to do it all the time,” 
Muschamp said. “The effort’s not 
always what it needs to be, quite frankly.”
However, he did praise other 
young linemen, including Taven Bryan and Joey Ivie.
“[Bryan is] a guy that’s really 
coming on,” Muschamp said. “He’s only going to continue to get bet-
ter. He runs extremely well. He’s a 
good athlete. He’s got really good strength. He’s one of the stronger defensive linemen as far of just hand, hand strength … A tough guy to deal with as far as that’s con-cerned.”
On the other side of the line, the 
Gators’ centers are having trouble 
getting the ball in the hands of their 
quarterbacks. So far, Florida has been repping Max Garcia, Cameron Dillard and Trip Thurman at the po-sition.
Under new offensive coordina-
tor Kurt Roper, UF is moving to a shotgun-based offense, so the cen-ters’ struggles don’t bode well for 
the installation of the new game 
plan.
“If we continue to have those, 
we need to look in a different direc-tion,” Muschamp said. “We can’t afford to have that anymore.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 9, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The year was 2009. Coach Mike 
Holloway and his current assistant 
Erin Tucker were scouting four sprinters who would make Florida a threat for years to come. 
With three of the four sprinters 
living in Florida — the other from New Jersey — Holloway and his 
program had a great opportunity 
at snagging them all to compete for the Gators for their collegiate careers.  
Now recognized as one of the 
best 4x400-meter relays squads in the country, Hugh Graham Jr., Dedric Dukes, Najee Glass and Ar-
man Hall have seen their share of 
success while donning the Gator uniform.  
“I remember when Hugh and 
Dedric were seniors and Gino and Najee were juniors (in high school),” Holloway said. “Coach Tucker and I sat down and talked and looked at the list, and our goal 
was to get four of the top five guys 
in the country.
“Our goal was to get four of 
those five guys here, and we did. We knew we’d have something special with those guys.”
The quartet of sprinters have 
accumulated personal records on several UF top-10 lists, are the de-
fending national outdoor champi-
ons and recently set the second-fastest collegiate time in the 4x4. But the core group has also ac-
complished noteworthy feats indi-vidually.
Hall is the 200-meter dash 
Southeastern Conference indoor champion. Dukes was named UST-
FCCCA’s Division I National Ath-
lete of the Week. 
Graham was one of four athletes 
in 2013 to receive three USTFC-CCA D1 First Team All-America accolades outdoors, and Glass is an All-American who just set his per-sonal record (21.05) in the 200m at Florida Relays.
Furthermore, Hall, Dukes, Gra-
ham and Glass hold the Florida record in the 4x4 with a time of 2:59.73, which was also the world-leading time this season edging out Gainesville Elite.
“You have to give credit to all 
four guys,” Holloway said. “You also have to thank the elite group 
that ran with us pulling us to 
that.”
What’s even more special about 
this group of athletes is that they didn’t realize they would clock a sub-three minute time this early in the season and still have a chance of breaking that record come out-door nationals. 
“We knew we would have some-
thing special with those guys,” Holloway said. “That’s what you saw, four very talented athletes, four very strong competitors and they just go out there and get after it. I’m very proud of them.”Sprinter corps anchors
Gators’ deep rosterMedina went 2 for 5 in series
hit a ground ball up the mid-
dle. Medina grabbed the ball behind second base, made a quick turnaround and threw the ball to catcher Aubree Mu-
nro at home to tag out Tiffany 
Howard.
“That’s a tough play to 
make, especially with her mo-mentum going the opposite way,” Munro said. 
“For her to throw the ball 
the opposite way, that’s an in-credible play. It’s just heads up. 
That’s the way Katie plays.”In the series against the Ti-
gers, Medina found success at 
the plate. The junior went 2 for 5 at the plate against Auburn after posting a .237 batting av-erage on the season before the 
series began.
“I went up there with a dif-
ferent mentality than I have,” 
Medina said. 
“I went up there looking for 
a pitch. Not do too much, but get on base so that my team-mates can drive me in. It felt great to just be up there.”
But while her success at the 
plate was a factor that Wal-ton commended, it was her rebounding as a leader on de-fense that Walton was the most proud of.
“The way she played this 
weekend, she didn’t play that way against Ole Miss. She 
didn’t play that way in several 
games before that,” Walton said. “So, to me, if she plays like that, I don’t care if she ever gets a hit. That’s what a short-stop is supposed to play like at this level. 
“She can bunt and do her 
things, but that’s exactly what 
it’s supposed to look like the 
way she played this week-end.”
