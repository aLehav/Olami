Six UF students will have the opportuni-
ty to attend media day at Super Bowl XLVII 
in New Orleans today.
Jason Cole, an adjunct UF journalism 
professor, invited his sports reporting class to observe the media day with about 2,000 reporters from news outlets like ESPN, NFL.com and CBS.“It’s probably the biggest setting of me-
dia at one place at one time,” he said.
Cole, who is also a reporter for Yahoo  
News, was able to get press passes for his students. He said students will get a tour of the media center, Radio Row — a gathering space for all attending radio stations — and have guest lecturers from radio, TV and on-line news outlets.
“They would be seen but not heard,” he 
said.Media day starts at about 9 a.m. today. 
Cole, who is not attending the event, said he would have class in the afternoon.
This is the second time Cole has offered 
to take his class to media day. In 2010, he in-vited his students to the Super Bowl when it was hosted in Miami. Cole said he invites his students when Super Bowls are hosted near Gainesville.He said each student must make his or 
her own transportation plans but that he would cover the cost for a hotel with Mar-riott reward points.
“I’m pretty parental when it comes to 
that,” he said.
UF journalism junior Caitlin Hartley, 20, 
said she carpooled with other students Mon-day.
“Not a lot of students would get this be-
cause we’re lucky to have a teacher like Ja-son who covers the NFL,” Hartley said.

It was in the early hours 
of Jan. 29, 2012 when Ala-
chua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce Lt. Todd Kelly received a call about an accident on Interstate 75 in Paynes Prairie State Park.
Even a year later, he re-
members the scene vividly . The emergency lights ﬂ  ashing through the thick fog. The smell of deployed airbags, gasoline and smoke hanging in the air. The lines of wrecked vehicles stretching from one side of the prairie to the other.
“It seemed to never end,” 
Kelly said. “The farther I went in, the worse it got.”
   
On the afternoon of Jan. 
28, 2012, smoke from a Paynes Prairie brush ﬁ  re blanketed U.S. 441 and I-75.
Overnight, the smoke 
swirled with the early morning fog, causing the Florida High-way Patrol to close the roads after responding to several ac-cidents due to drivers’ limited visibility.
The FHP reopened the roads a few hours later. But the crashes continued.
Shortly after 4 a.m., 911 calls 
started to pour into FHP from I-75, according to Alligator ar-chives.
Soon, ofﬁ  cials were dealing 
with a multi-car accident that eventually left 11 people dead and more than a dozen in the hospital, according to archives.
   
Today marks the one-year 
anniversary of the I-75 crash, an event that is considered to be one of the deadliest car ac-cidents in the history of North Central Florida.
In the year following the 
crash, the Florida Department of Transportation, Florida For-est Services and the FHP col-laborated to make driving safer in the event that dense fog or smoke envelops the roads along Paynes Prairie.
The city installed cameras 
along I-75 to monitor the traf-ﬁ  c and to send live images of the road to the Gainesville City Trafﬁ  c Management System, said FDOT spokeswoman Gina Busscher.

The Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce arrested two Gainesville men 
and a UF student over the weekend as part of an Internet sex sting op-eration.
Deputies arrested Benjamin 
Wade Parker, Lance Thomas Kriete and Richard Lee Ashcraft III on felo-ny charges, according to ASO arrest reports.
The sting was part of Operation 
Nightlight, an undercover online sex sting opera-
tion that started  Thursday and ended Sunday morning, said ASO spokesman Lt. Todd Kelly.
Kriete, 20, 
of 13 Fraternity Row, responded 
Friday night to an online ad, where he started talking to who he thought was the father of a 14-year-old girl.
During the conversation, Kriete 
allegedly wrote, “id love to help her explore her body and what to do with older guys.” 
He later said to the father, “what 
if I told you id love to f--- the s--- out of her?” according to the report.
The next night, Kriete drove to 
meet the girl and was arrested by deputies.
Deputies booked Kriete into the 
Alachua County Jail at 3:19 a.m. Sunday on a $75,000 bond. He was later released just after midnight

The Swamp Party announced 
its candidates for Student Body 
vice president and treasurer on Turlington Plaza on Monday af-ternoon.
The party’s presidential candi-
date, Christina Bonarrigo, present-ed Joselyn Rivas and Jayce Victor as the vice president and treasurer candidates, respectively.
Rivas, 20, UF finance and psy-
chology junior, has served as trea-surer for Hispanic Heritage Month and the diversity division chair of Student Government Cabinet in the 2012-2013 school year. If elect-ed, Rivas said she would focus on community and diversity in the Student Body.
Victor, 22, UF philosophy se-nior, served as a District D sena-tor, a member-at-large of the Col-lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences Student Council and president of the Black Law Student Associa-tion (Pre-Law).
“I will use everything I have 
learned to make a change on this campus,” Victor said.
The Students Party announced

UF environmental science ju-
nior Billy Farrell, 21, is running for treasurer. He is the president of UF’s College Democrats.

◗ ILLNESSES ARE PLAYED 
UP IN FILMS, EXPERT SAID.
ALEXA VOLLAND
Alligator Writer
The Academy-Award-nomi-
nated film “Silver Linings Play-
book” is a contender for the best movie of the year. But some critics wonder how accurately it portrays mental illness.
Alvin Lawrence, licensed psy-
chologist at the Counseling and Wellness Center, said movies need entertainment value so experiences become more dramatic and symp-toms become more amplified.
The movie, which was released  
in December, focuses on Brad-ley Cooper’s character, Pat, who was recently discharged from a mental hospital. His love interest, Tiffany, played by Jennifer Law-rence, is battling her own demons. Although their portrayals have earned best actor nominations and praise for being realistic, the feel-good romantic ending left audi-
ences chuckling at the drama.For the director to condense 
someone’s everyday life into an 
hour and a half, audiences can misunderstand that day-to-day life doesn’t happen that quickly , Lawrence said.
“Art sometimes reflects life,” he 
said. “But depending on the way it is presented, movies have as much potential to help as to harm.”
He has not seen “Silver Linings 
Playbook” but said in any Holly-wood portrayal of mental illness audiences have to be mindful that someone may do something that is funny , but there is something that runs deeper underneath.
“We laugh when we are un-
comfortable,” he said.
Lawrence said challenges that 
characters face in movies can be found funny when they are taken out of context.
“But put in context, that is 
someone’s life,” he said. “They aren’t deciding to be manic in the middle of the night.”
Some critics felt like the roman-
tic big finish suggests that love can heal mental illness.
“It’s possible, but that’s not 
what we see,” Lawrence said. “It’s not to say that someone can’t manage their symptoms without medication or intensive treatment. There are people who do that. But that may not be the norm.”
Taylor Scott, a 19-year-old UF 
nursing freshman, said her friend told her it was a comedy, but she was surprised with how serious some parts of the movie were.
Although “Silver Linings Play-
book” was met with cinematic success, Lawrence said movies that portray mental illness could make people feel oversimplified or insulted.
But in the end, “you have to rec-
ognize it’s entertainment and take it with a grain of salt,” he said.

Vehicle detectors and TV cameras monitor the highway now
said, will happen early next year 
when the FDOT begins a $3 million project that will help keep motorists safe while driving with low visibil-ity.
The project consists of the in-
stallation of three changeable mes-sage signs along the Micanopy and Gainesville corridor of I-75, Busscher said. V ehicle detectors that measure speeds to see if there’s a problem will be installed on the same poles as the current TV cameras. Sensors will also measure visibility on the road.
By the time the project is com-pleted, she said, the detectors and sensors will be integrated into the 511 system, which drivers can call to find out road conditions. Busscher said additional cameras will be in-stalled along U.S. 441.
FHP spokeswoman Capt. Nancy 
Rasmussen said her department went through internal training for handling crashes caused by smoke and fog. 
  
At the scene last year, Kelly re-
called ASO deputies walking into the fog, calling out to people who needed help. Other deputies walked in front of ambulances, helping them navigate through the fog and wreckage.
One deputy told Kelly “it was 
like walking into a ‘white cloud.’”
“While they’re doing this, they 
could hear crashes actually occur -
ring,” Kelly said. “All this happen-ing around them, almost like being in a warzone.”
In his 15 years as a law enforce-
ment officer, Kelly said the Jan. 29 crash was like nothing he’d ever seen before.
“There’s no textbook for dealing 
with that,” he said. “Nothing you train for prepares you for a thing like that.”
Chief Larry Stewart of Alachua 
County Fire Rescue felt the same.
“The unique part about this was 
the visibility,” he said.
The biggest issue was commu-
nication between fire rescue and law enforcement, he said. Tech-nology that can patch radio chan-nels together exists, which Stewart said they will use in the future to strengthen communication.
He said he feels the department 
is better prepared if a similar crash were to happen because it now has personnel with more experience.
“Now we can make better deci-
sions on something that we have never really trained on or practiced or even thought of in previous inci-dents,” he said.
  
The fog that covered the roads 
that January morning could happen again, said UF meteorologist Jeff Huffman.
Inter-agency communication be-
tween the forest service, FHP and FDOT has improved as well through an agreement signed Jan. 15, said Ludie Bond, wildlife mitigation specialist. In a wildfire or prescribed fire situation, the forestry service or land management agency would alert FHP , who would determine what action to take and request help from the FDOT if necessary.
“We’ve been coordinating our 
message points and making sure the general public is getting the most up-to-date and accurate info,” Bond said. “And that can’t help but improve safety on the highways.”
  
Since the crash, the pavement on 
I-75 has been repaired.
But old wounds leave scars, and 
for Kelly , each bump and patch on the road as he drives on I-75 through Paynes Prairie is a reminder — a snapshot of the fiery crash and the emergency officials who stared danger in the face to save the lives of others.
“It’s imprinted in you,” he said. 
“You don’t wash it off. It’s some-thing you live with forever.”crash , from page 1

Beta Theta Pi asks for privacy as it works with authorities
Kriete is a UF junior and currently a mem-
ber of the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.
Trent Talbot, president of Beta Theta Pi, is-
sued a statement about Kriete’s arrest.
“We were shocked, disappointed and sad-
dened to learn yesterday of the alleged person-
al conduct of Lance Kriete, a member of our Fraternity ,” he wrote in an email. “As a result, we have been working closely with the local authorities, the University of Florida admin-istration and our General Fraternity to ensure that Beta Theta Pi contributes in every manner possible to the timely legal investigation. Out of concern and respect for Lance’s friends and fraternity brothers that have been affected so significantly upon learning of the allegations, we ask for considerate privacy in the coming days as the investigatory process continues.”
Parker, 24, of 4117 SW 20th Ave., allegedly 
spoke to who he thought was a 13-year-old girl, saying that he was 17 years old, according to the report. He sent a picture of a penis to the girl and asked her to send him a picture, according to the report. He also said that he wanted to have oral sex with the girl.
Deputies arrested Parker and later booked 
him into Alachua County Jail at about 4 a.m. Friday , where he remained Monday night with a $250,000 bond.
Ashcraft, 40, of 1021 NW 23rd Ave., re-
sponded to an online ad Saturday, according to the report. He thought he was emailing a 13-year-old girl and asked if she wanted to have sex.
During questioning, Ashcraft told police 
he thought he was talking with an 18-year-old girl but later said he knew the girl was 13 years old.
Deputies later booked Ashcraft into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 3 a.m. Sunday, where he remained Monday night with a $75,000 bond.

Qualifying for the 2013 
Gainesville mayoral and Dis-trict 4 City Commission races began Monday at noon and will last until noon Friday.
As of Monday , seven people 
had expressed their intent to run in the mayoral election: for-mer Commissioner Ed Braddy , former Commissioner Scher-win Henry, former Gainesville-Alachua County Regional Air-port Authority board member Pete Johnson, Donald Shepherd Sr., Mark V enzke, barbershop owner Edward Earl Young and incumbent Mayor Craig Lowe.
So far, Braddy , Johnson and 
Lowe have qualiﬁ  ed, according to the Alachua County Supervi-sor of Elections website.
City Commission candi-
dates are UF student Alfredo Espinosa, incumbent Randy Wells and former Commis-sioner W.E. “Mac” McEachern, who might not meet residency requirements.
McEachern’s address fell 
within the former District 4 boundaries but falls outside the redrawn district lines commis-sioners unanimously approved in December.
However, McEachern said 
via email he submitted the nec-essary paperwork and paid the 
q u a l i f y i n g fee Monday.
As of 
Monday  night, only Espinosa had qualiﬁ  ed for 
the District 4 race.
To qual-
ify , a District 4 candidate must be a resident of that district for at least six months prior to qual-ifying. The same length of time is required for mayoral candi-dates in regard to Gainesville residency.
The last dates to have moved into the city or District 4 are be-tween July 30 and Aug. 3, de-pending on which day in 2013 the candidate qualiﬁ  es, accord-ing to the Supervisor of Elec-tions.
Candidates must also ap-
point campaign treasurers and designate campaign deposito-ries by ﬁ  ling a form with the Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce before they can collect or spend money on campaigns. Within 10 days of ﬁ  ling that form, can-didates must ﬁ  le forms stating they have read and understood campaign ﬁ  nance laws under Chapter 106 of the Florida Stat-utes.
When qualifying, candidates  
ﬁ  le a statement of ﬁ  nancial in-terests form, a loyalty oath, a residency afﬁ  davit and pay a qualifying fee or ﬁ  le a waiver.
The fee is 1 percent of the 
salary of the ofﬁ  ce — $404.36 for mayoral candidates and $317.71 for City Commission candidates, according to the Su-pervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce.
The election is March 19.

Students gathered in the atrium 
of UF’s Ustler Hall on Monday at 8 
p.m. for a presentation on LGBT inti-mate partner violence.
Intimate partner violence in-
volves one partner who is exerting power and control over another.
The event was coordinated by 
Pride Student Union and a UF LGBT Affairs ambassador, Mirella Flores, a 20-year-old UF psychology senior.
While the LGBT community was 
acknowledged during the presen-tation, this form of violence occurs with the same frequency as in het-erosexual relationships. 
Intimate partner violence occurs 
in about 33 percent of all intimate relationships, according to the Na-tional Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs. 
The audience was asked to ﬁ  ll out 
surveys concerning its exposure to violence and abuse. Two-thirds of the audience answered “yes” to: Do you know someone who has been physically, emotionally or sexually harmed by his or her partner?
Flores invited representatives 
from Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network Inc., and Alachua County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Cen-ter to inform students about the dan-gers of intimate partner violence.
Juan Camargo said he hadn’t 
known the extent of help available  to victims.
“I feel more equipped to help any 
friends who might be suffering with partner violence,” said the 21-year-old UF civil engineering junior.Students talk LGBT

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Did you change your driving habits 
after last year’s I-75 crash?
Monday’s question: Do you Google your 
symptoms when you’re sick?
84 TOTAL VOTES79% YES
21% NOChicken Sh*t: 
Maybe Chick-ﬁ  l-A 
turned the other cheek
Put down your tar and feathers, folks. Chick-ﬁ  l-A may be 
changing its hateful priorities.
According to an article from CNN, Campus Pride, a 
leading national LGBT campus organization, said Chick-ﬁ  l-A “no longer funds the most controversial and politically charged anti-same-sex-marriage groups and has not since 2011.”
The article also said the lump of donations focus on “‘youth, 
education, marriage enrichment and local communities’ and that in the list of the foundation’s beneﬁ  ciaries, ‘the most divi-sive, anti-LGBT groups are no longer listed.’”
OK! It seems like we’re ﬁ  nally moving in the right direction.Yes, there is always more than one side to an argument. This 
past summer, when the world half-boycotted, half-supported-the-crap-out-of those greasy chicken sandwiches, lovers of the company couldn’t understand why it couldn’t make whatever donations it wanted.
The point, however, is a company and its executive board can 
believe in whatever they so choose, but everyone else is allowed to as well.
Where does the boundary of your rights or privileges end? 
At spouse selection. Maybe Chick-ﬁ  l-A ﬁ  nally saw that.
The company released a statement this week, according to 
the Los Angeles Times, that tried to explain, again, what it actu-ally intends to put its donations toward.
“Over the past three years alone, Chick-ﬁ  l-A has given more 
than $68 million in contributions to over 700 different educa-tional and charitable organizations around the country, in addi-tion to providing millions of dollars in food donations,” it stated. “Our intent is to not support political or social agendas.”
We still have our suspicions.Conservative values are ﬁ  ne. We don’t want to make it seem 
like being charitable to the types of organizations Chick-ﬁ  l-A listed is a horrible thing. We just think and hope that, as a coun-try , we can continue to grow toward a level of peace with one another. There’s no reason to throw millions of dollars to groups whose main goals are to hurt people.
“It is about opposing viewpoints, not opposing people,” said 
Shane Windmeyer, the executive director of Campus Pride, regarding Dan Cathy, the president of Chick-ﬁ  l-A. “Dan cares about young people and was upset to hear how his company was being used to hurt LGBT students.”
Maybe the bigger picture here is that we all need to look way, 
way past what companies do. It shouldn’t matter how a compa-ny spends its billions of dollars because we’re a consumer-based society. However, it totally does matter.
If only we didn’t have to rely on donations from huge com-
panies in order to get stuff done. If only Americans didn’t spend so much money on everything, all the time, forever.
But we do. So we have to be concerned where our money 
ends up. Because if we don’t pay attention to it now, then this will happen again and more often until we limit where large companies can donate.
No need to fund hate with millions of dollars. We should 
support organizations that do good things.
 Unemployment is still high.
Median household income is down.
The number of Americans on food stamps and 
receiving entitlements is soaring.
The national debt is $16.4 trillion.The president wants to spend, spend, spend. But hey , it’s all Bush’s fault.       America has changed. The Reagan-era of small govern-
ment is over. And to borrow a reference from the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, we are witnessing a rise of “New America,” an Amer-ica where big government is not over; an America where open-mindedness is saluted; an America where morality is subjective, relative and differs according to each individual; an America where the media slobbers over one party , one administration; an America where success is penalized; an America where fairness is more noble than prosperity; an America where guns are evil, not people; an America where 55 million potential human lives have been aborted for the sake of convenience; an America where “coolness” is more virtuous than leadership; an America where men serve on the front lines so women don’t have to. 
Wait, I take that last one back. Two weeks ago, I wrote an article discussing the extinc-
tion of objective truth in America. I talked about the left’s tolerance — a repressive tolerance that masquerades un-der the guise of open-mindedness. Well, a few weeks ago, Christian pastor Louie Giglio withdrew from delivering the benediction and inaugural prayer because of the outrage that emerged after a liberal watchdog group exposed his stance on homosexuality . 
During a sermon 20 years ago, Giglio stated that homo-
sexuality is a sin, and that the “only way out of a homosexual lifestyle … is through the healing power of Jesus.” He went on to discuss his stance on homosexuality, and pointed out that everyone, gay or not, is in need of a savior. According to an article written by Albert Mohler, Giglio spoke endlessly about God’s grace and called his entire congregation to re-pent and to come to Christ.
Days after Giglio withdrew, Addie Whisenant of the Pres-
idential Inaugural Committee issued this statement: “We were not aware of Pastor Giglio’s past comments at the time of his selection, and they don’t reﬂ  ect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural … As we now work to select someone to deliver the bene-diction, we will ensure their beliefs reﬂ  ect this administration’s vision of inclusion and acceptance for all 
Americans.”
In other words, the administration’s “vision of inclusion 
and acceptance” includes all Americans, except for those Americans that believed, at any time, the homosexual lifestyle was sinful. Obama? He gets the pass. His stance evolved.
Is anyone surprised, though? The left becomes more ex-
plosive over Christians who believe in Christianity than me after I eat Mexican. I mean, every time a Christian recon-ﬁ  rms his or her belief in anything Biblical, those supporting the left pretends as if they’re surprised. They’re in favor of free speech, until something that’s said doesn’t reﬂ  ect their speech (See: Chick-ﬁ  l-A). PSY can call for the slow and pain-ful death of our “daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers,” but as long as his stance on homosexuality doesn’t dissent from the White House, he can sing to the president all he wants.    
The irony here is that modern Liberalism is a lot like 
Christianity . Government is their church, and the taxpayers are their congregation. The bureaucrats are their deacons, and the president is their priest. They worship at the alter of tolerance and open-mindedness, but they practice the exact opposite of what they preach. 
Conservatives and Republicans are the lost, the pagans 
and the heathens. They’re not in the mainstream, for they walk on the path that is narrow and out-of-touch. 
All that is good is liberal, and all who advance what is 
liberal are good.

Presidents breathe rare air, and re-
elected presidents, rarer air still. Only 44 people in American his-
tory have held the office of president. Barack Obama is just the 17th to have been elected twice. 
Rare air sometimes invigorates. 
More often, it makes people dizzy. 
An oddity of American politics is that nearly every president wants a second term, but second terms almost never turn out well. 
The re-elected Thomas Jefferson co-
erced Congress into declaring a ruin-ous embargo. Andrew Jackson sent the country into a financial tailspin. Abra-ham Lincoln and William McKinley were assassinated. Woodrow Wilson broke his health in a vain attempt to per-suade Americans to join the League of Nations. 
The unlucky list goes on.
The second-term curse can be as-
cribed to an evil alignment of influ-ences. Second-termers enjoy no hon-eymoon. Their opponents attack them and their policies from the moment they retake their oath of office. 
Second-termers typically operate 
with a second-string team. On first election, they get their top choices for Cabinet and White House positions, but those first picks generally resign from the most crucial — and stressful — offices by the end of the first term. Their successors are usually less tal-ented, less energetic, less credible or less reliable.
Second-term presidencies are prone 
to scandal. Some of this tendency is a statistical artifact because presiden-cies, in general, are prone to scandal. 
If a scandal occurs during a first 
term, that president doesn’t get a sec-ond term. 
If the first term is scandal-free, the 
odds are likelier to catch up with the president in the second term.
But scandals also reflect a relaxation 
of standards, a loss of vigilance. 
First-term presidents who attempt election to a second term — a group that includes every president since Rutherford Hayes — mind their man-ners and those of their administrations with great care. 
Once freed of the burden of run-
ning again, however, they often let their guard down.
Yet hope springs eternal for sec-
ond terms, not least among those who achieve them. 
Second-term presidents can focus 
on the long run — on issues too large or with payoffs too distant to survive the short-run tyranny that has con-strained them heretofore. 
A first-term president asks how a 
decision will read in the next day’s pa-pers. 
A second-term president asks how 
it will read in the history books. Sec-ond-term presidents can ascend the moral high ground of the national in-terest, as opposed to the party interest, and not be charged with hypocrisy as easily as first-termers.
What does all this mean for Barack 
Obama? 
First, he must be extremely careful 
to avoid scandals. Nothing stays secret for long these days. 
The slightest slip by him or a sub-
ordinate can ruin what remains of his presidency. 
The four most recent two-term 
presidencies ended in ignominy or se-vere embarrassment: Nixon in Water -
gate, Reagan in Iran-Contra, Clinton in impeachment, Bush in the Katrina bungle. 
Obama must be very watchful — 
and perhaps lucky — to avoid a simi-lar fate.
Second, he should concentrate on 
a few carefully chosen issues. With these, he might have a chance at suc-cess. 
In his second inaugural address, he 
staked a position on immigration re-form that would have been bold before the election, but that parallels what many Repub-licans have been thinking after the elec-
tion results revealed how thoroughly they have alienated Latinos. 
Expect a bipartisan law before the 
end of the current Congress. More dif-ficult, yet more pressing, is a grand bargain on taxes and spending. 
The Republicans have already re-
treated from the federal debt limit. If Obama doesn’t push too hard, he might win the moderate Republican votes he needs to put fiscal policy on a sustainable path.
Third, he almost certainly will de-
vote more of his time to foreign policy, especially in his seventh and eighth years. 
Presidents are merely coequals 
with Congress in domestic affairs, but in matters of war and peace and much of what lies between, they enjoy great autonomy. 
They can embark on wars, negoti-
ate treaties and do all the other things that lie within the purview of the com-mander in chief and chief diplomat. 
Obama might attempt a transat-
lantic trade pact with the European Union, issue executive orders on cli-mate change or jump-start the peace process between Israel and the Pales-tinians. 
There is no guarantee of success — 
foreign policy is hard. 
But when the approach of 2016 
tempts the Republicans to run out the clock on Obama, as it assuredly will, foreign policy will seem like a vaca-tion.
In fact, foreign policy is often a va-
cation for presidents, which is another reason it beckons second-termers. There’s no ride like Air Force One.

Barack Obama and the second-term curseUWire

The American people have just finally ex-
haled after enduring a long and tiring pres-idential campaign, and already the talk has 
turned to 2016.
In my first PR presidency class, we addressed 
this talk with a discussion of our own. First, we talked about the many names rumored to be 2016 contenders, and then about just one of those names: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
My professor gingerly brought up the subject 
of Christie’s girth and then, as politely as pos-sible, asked us, “Is Chris Christie too fat to be president?”
The problem with the “Christie is too fat” ar -
gument is it is are all preconceived. He and his team of savvy politicos can anticipate any claim and prepare for it. “Heart disease” is countered with “no history in the family .” “High blood pressure” is refuted with “What presidential can-didate doesn’t have high blood pressure in such a fast-paced campaign?” And the surest answer to any query is a clean bill of health from his doc-tor, which is entirely possible. (Granted, that bill of health would include a scribbled note from the doctor saying, “Lose weight,” but let’s ignore that for a moment.)
The kicker, of course, would be an exercise 
regimen. Many argue that if Christie starts to lose weight, he is definitely running in 2016.
But I argue Christie can be a contender — and 
quite possibly win — without ever dropping a pound from now until Election Day 2016. His 
weight will be an issue, but only a subconscious one. His opponents won’t bring it up out of courte-sy , and only reporters and 
town hall-goers will dare to broach the subject.
To be sure, Christie will be asked about his 
weight. But if he has a ready-made answer that displays enough humor (without getting angry at the premise of the question or the questioner’s right to ask it), he can effectively turn his weight into a non-issue.
Remember Ronald Reagan’s famous 1984 one-
liner? When asked a question about his age — he would become the oldest president elected — Reagan coolly responded, “I am not going to ex-ploit, for political purposes, my opponent’s youth and inexperience.” If Christie can have a similar “Reagan moment” (and he can), he will beat the “Christie is too fat” argument.
Not to mention, Christie’s weight simply plays 
into his devil-may-care attitude. It’s as much a part of his character as his aggressive press con-ferences. And characters do well on television.
What is most interesting about this whole “Is 
Christie too large?” debate is that it seems to be divided on generational lines. In my class many , if not most, students dismissed Christie’s weight as an unimportant factor. Meanwhile, our professor (who is about our parents’ age) could not accept the idea that the American people would ignore such an obvious trait.
Perhaps the youngest voting generation is 
more willing to overlook physical differences in light of policy differences. After all, we were the ones who helped propel the first African-Ameri-can into the presidency . Perhaps we’ll do it again with the first modern president who happens to be big-boned.

Despite receiving thou-
sands of dollars from the 
Florida Department of State, the Hippodrome State The-atre is still struggling to break even on international films being aired through its Cinema program.
For 31 years, the theater, 
located at 25 SE Second Place, has shown a variety of inter -
national and domestic films.
Cinema director Shir -
ley Lasseter said the theater needs about 20 attendees per show to break even.
“For us to stay strong fi-nancially, we need more like 30 to 40 people to show up per show,” she said.
At capacity, the Hippo-
drome Cinema can seat 95 people, Lasseter said. In re-cent screenings of the “The Loneliest Planet” and “The Other Son,” it averaged be-tween 17 and 20 people per showing.
“It’s getting harder and 
harder to actually get our au-dience to leave their homes and come downtown,” she said.
Lasseter attributes the rise 
of high-definition television, online streaming websites like Netflix and movie rental kiosks like Redbox to the de-clining number of attendees at the theater’s international film screenings.
This year, the theater re-
quested about $250,000 from the Florida Department of State, according to state fi-nancial records online. The state gave the theater more than half of what it requested — about $141,000.
Rocky Draud, manag-
ing director for the Hippo-drome, said the grant money is used for all of the theater’s programs, which includes a hearing assistance system in the Mainstage and the Cine-ma, as well as upgrading the building’s alarm system.
Nicole Daenzer, director 
of finance, said funds are distributed depending on fi-nancial need of theater’s pro-grams.
Daenzer said the low at-
tendee numbers at the Cin-ema were a “marketing is-sue.” She said the theater is now turning to social media to promote its screenings.
Meanwhile, Lasseter 
said the theater is working to promote more commu-nity engagement during the movie screenings. One way is through post-show discus-sions among moviegoers.
“What we’re trying to do 
is engage people more on that aspect and underscore the importance of sharing the experience and hearing people laugh or gasp or cry when you’re watching a film together,” she said.
For now, Daenzer said she 
doesn’t think the theater in-tends to close the Cinema.
Scott Nygren, professor 
with the Film and Media Studies Program at UF, said he believes most Americans are unaware of international films.
Films produced outside 
the United States often have stories that people would benefit from knowing, he said. For this reason, Nygren encourages people to watch more foreign movies.
“If you are aware of in-
ternational films, encourage people to look for the unusu-al films,” he said.  “It’s a big, wonderful world out there.” 8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2013

A UF engineering instructor has received 
funding to study a compound that could po-
tentially make solar energy more affordable.
Materials science and engineering associate 
professor Jiangeng Xue will work on the light powered technology project with researchers from two other universities. Their research aims to test barium silicide, a compound of barium and silicon found in Earth’s crust.Little is known about the barium silicide 
compound, and its application for solar power has not really been studied. The abundance of both barium and silicon could make solar cells cost-effective.
The compound also could be promising 
in terms of harvesting sunlight, being a semi-conductor and transporting the electric charge carriers.
Xue stressed the necessity for cheap, clean 
energy to compete with fossil fuels.
“Overall, it is really important to find a low cost resource,” Xue said. “The question is further lowering the cost and driv-ing the efficiency up.”
The Scialog Collabora-
tive Innovation Award from 
the Research Corporation for Science Advancement is funding the project. The 
corporation funds high-risk and potentially high-reward research.
“When [the research] does succeed, the re-sults can trigger major changes in technology and, occasionally , even in our fundamental understanding of nature,” said James M. Gen-tile, president and CEO of the corporation.
Xue and his UF students will be working 
on the solar cells themselves. Meanwhile, a team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will focus on the computer calcu-lation of the compound’s properties. A team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison will research the chemical synthesis of the ma-terials.

◗ THE ELECTRONIC FORMS COME 
MORE QUICKLY THAN PAPER ONES.

UF is extending its green efforts to the Uni-
versity Bursar’s office by transitioning a tax 
form from paper to paperless.
The Bursar’s Finance and Accounting Divi-
sion allows students to get the Internal Rev-enue Service tax Form 1098-T online instead of via mail. The form helps students claim educa-tional tax credit on federal income tax returns.
The campaign began because forms were 
being mailed and sent back, said Annie Bret-nall, administrative services coordinator for the Bursar’s office.
“Sometimes they get lost or students don’t 
update their mailing address,” she said.
The electronic method permits students 
to access the form about a month earlier than those who have to wait for it in the mail, said Ruth Harris, associate controller for the office.
The office will start signing and delivering 
the forms Thursday. Students should start re-ceiving them two weeks later. Those with  the electronic service should receive them instant-ly . However, students must give permission before signing up for the paperless method.
“I have heard about it, but I haven’t taken 
the time to actually sit down and give my permission,” said Sean Stewart-Muniz, an 18-year-old UF journalism freshman.
Students can submit their consent online at 
my.ufl.edu under 1098-T consent form.UF student

Kailyn Allen spent more than a year 
campaigning against President Barack 
Obama as chairwoman of the Florida Federation of Teenage Republicans. Now, she has until March to think of one ques-tion to ask him when she meets him in person.
Allen, an 18-year-old senior at P .K. 
Yonge Developmental Research School, was one of two students chosen in Florida to attend the 51st annual United States Senate Youth Program from March 9 to March 16 in Washington, D.C.
“It’s an incredible opportunity to be 
able to talk to the leader of the free world,” she said.
The merit-based program, sponsored 
by the Senate and funded by the Hearst Foundations, gives students an in-depth look at the American government and the history and rules of the Senate, program director Rayne Guilford said.
Guilford said students were chosen 
based on their academic excellence, lead-ership qualities and experience serving a constituency in an elected office position.
Allen, who is a dual-enrolled student 
at UF, is president of her senior class and president of the school’s Speech and Debate Club. She founded the Alachua County Teen Republicans last year and received the National Teenage Republi-can Rising Star Award in July.
Guilford said the program aims to 
promote leadership in students through discussions with elected officials.
She added that Obama attended the 
program every year during his first term.“We pretty much rearrange everything 
to fit the president in,” she said.
Delegates will also meet with a Su-
preme Court associate justice, a United States ambassador, Cabinet members and senators.
“Hearing the advice, and hearing first-
hand from the people who are such in-credible leaders, that’s something that I’m going to carry with me for the rest of my life,” Allen said.
Along with an all-expenses-paid trip 
to tour monuments and museums, Allen and the other delegates will receive $5,000 undergraduate college scholarships.
Allen hopes to attend law school and 
later run for a public office position.
“Hopefully she can live and learn from 
other people’s perspectives,” her father, Kevin Allen, 55, said.
Gary Boulware, advanced placement 
government and economics teacher at P .K. Yonge, said he saw Allen’s interest in politics when she ran for class president.
“It was pretty interesting for me to 
watch a young lady navigate sometimes treacherous political waters, and do so rather effectively,” he said.
Catherine Atria, principal at P .K. 
Yonge, said she was excited that Allen was chosen as a delegate.
“It’s certainly quite an honor to have 
her as our student and be recognized in this fashion,” she said.TUESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� THE PROJECT INDUCES HEARING LOSS.
KATIE BURNS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Researchers at UF have developed a way to 
safely create temporary, reversible hearing loss 
in order to observe possible prevention drugs.
The project induces temporary hearing loss 
in order to measure the effects of the drugs used for noise-induced hearing loss, said lead investi-gator and associate professor Colleen Le Prell.
The destruction of hearing-related hair cells 
in the inner ear by loud noise is irreversible.
Le Prell said noise-induced hearing loss is the 
second most common occupational disease.
“It is costing the [Veterans Affairs Hospital] 
more than $1 billion a year, so it’s a huge finan-cial problem,” she said.
Jillian Roberts, advocacy chair for the UF 
chapter of the National Student Speech Lan-guage and Hearing Association, said she thinks noise-induced hearing loss affects college stu-dents.
Le Prell’s model is the first to use controlled 
music levels to cause temporary hearing loss in human participants.UF working on

preseason deBeer Media Poll. The Gators return all but one starter from the 2012 roster.     KATIE AGOSTIN

 Even as the Gators led the 
Bulldogs by 21 points early in 
Saturday’s game, they weren’t letting up on defense. 
  Midway through the ﬁ  rst 
half, Mississippi State’s Craig Sword inbounded the ball to Trivante Bloodman.
  Junior Scottie Wilbekin 
kept Bloodman contained out-side the arc, and redshirt se-nior Mike Rosario came over to add extra pressure. 
In a panic, Bloodman 
jumped up and attempted a long pass to Tyson Cunning-ham. 
  Unfortunately for the Bull-
dogs, forward Will Yeguete was waiting nearby. 
  Yeguete grabbed the pass, 
took it back across the court and fed it to Wilbekin, who made a layup to put Florida up 31-8 with 8:31 left in the ﬁ  rst half.
  While the Gators rank ﬁ  fth 
in the Southeastern Confer-ence with 73.7 points per game, their defense is their identity. 
  “At the end of last year, 
trying to go into this season and looking at the areas where we needed to improve and get better at and show them visu-ally, statistically, individually and collectively as a group where they needed to get better,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
“What has happened is, 
because we have improved defensively, because we have gotten better from a year ago defensively, they are more ea-ger to do it. They are person-ally taking pride in it.”
  The No. 4 Gators’ 82-47 
win against the Bulldogs in Starkville, Miss., was the 10th time this season that Florida has held an opponent to less than 50 points. 
  Saturday’s win also moved 
Florida to 6-0 in SEC play. Since starting conference play on Jan. 9, the Gators have won by a margin of 27 points per contest.
  “There are things we’re do-
ing defensively that I’m giv-ing those guys an enormous responsibility to call out cov-erages on the defensive end of the ﬂ  oor,” Donovan said. “When you allow a team to do that, the coverages are go-ing to be mixed, which is a positive thing … I’ve tried to give them the responsibility to put the onus on them to be accountable for them com-municating, talking and doing those things.”
  Currently, Florida is ﬁ  rst 
in the nation with an adjusted defense efﬁ  ciency of 81, ac-cording to KenPom.com. 
  Helping the Gators lead 
the nation defensively is Wil-bekin, who was named SEC Player of the Week on Mon-day. Wilbekin is averaging 1.8 steals per game this season, which ranks 10th in the SEC.
  Collectively, Florida is 
averaging 8.8 steals and 3.2 blocks per game in conference play. The Gators also have a 55.7 rebounding percentage, which ranks ﬁ  rst in the SEC and seventh in the nation.
  Wilbekin is leading the 
Gators on defense, and center Patric Young said the junior’s defensive intensity translates to his teammates’ performanc-es.
  “Every position is really 
important because you can’t leave a guy out there on an is-land,” Young said. 
“Everyone needs to know 
how important help defense is, and us being able to play really good help defense helps everyone else out.”
Senior Kenny Boynton 
added: “We know the signiﬁ  -cance of what it can do for the team if we don’t play defense one possession. It can change the game.”

  Ta y l o r 
Gushue a l m o s t 
hit the lights at Mark Light Field in Coral Gables last season in just his ninth col-legiate game. Instead, the freshman settled for an awe-inspiring solo homer.
  He also homered on the ﬁ  rst pitch 
he saw in the season opener against then-No. 16 Cal State Fullerton. In all, Gushue started 28 games at ﬁ  rst base, six at designated hitter and ﬁ  ve at catcher in 2012.
  He may be young, but that hasn’t 
stopped Gushue.
  “The few times I was able to inter-
view him after games, the guy didn’t act like he was a 17 or 18-year-old,” Perfect Game Managing Editor Kend-all Rogers said. “That is a kind of a con-sistent trait they look for in catchers.”
  Now with Mr. Consistency in Mike 
Zunino gone, Gushue takes over for the Seattle Mariners catching prospect, who won nearly every national award in 2012.
  If Florida aims to earn its fourth-
straight Omaha appearance, Gushue needs to ﬁ  ll Big Z’s shoes  — at and behind the plate.
  Zunino led Florida in home runs 
and OPS last season. He controlled a pitching staff for three years that fea-tured 12 future MLB draft picks.
  Florida has two proven starting 
pitchers leading an otherwise young staff that Gushue will manage. 
   He succeeded at the plate when he 
ﬁ  rst came to Florida. 
Gushue, who skipped his senior 
high school season at Boca Raton Cal-vary Christian High, earned South-eastern Conference Freshman of the Week honors twice in his ﬁ  rst month of college baseball.
  Then a .143 batting average in 
SEC play saw him lose his everyday         starting spot. Sophomore

After winning back-to-back na-
tional titles, the Gators are thinking 
dynasty.
Senior Lauren Embree and ju-
nior Sofie Oyen hope to lead the No. 1 Florida women’s tennis team to a third consecutive national champi-onship this season. 
UF’s quest begins against USF 
today at 3 p.m. in Linder Stadium.
“I couldn’t even imagine win-
ning another national champion-ship,” Embree said. “Winning two was amazing and special, but win-ning a third would be unbelievable.
Oyen added: “Every year, we 
are tougher and stronger, so we’ll see how it plays out.”
UF has three players in the top 
25 with No. 1 Oyen, No. 5 Embree and No. 22 Danielle Collins.
No. 66 Brianna Morgan, No. 82 
Caroline Hitimana and No. 114 Ol-ivia Janowicz will also be key con-tributors. 
Freshmen Collins and Morgan 
will be competing in their first dual matches as Gators, and Oyen will be paired with Morgan in doubles. Last season, Oyen paired with 
Allie Will, who turned professional in July. Oyen said playing with a freshman in doubles will be chal-lenging due to the experience gap. But Oyen said the pair should be good enough to get the job done.  
The team returned every player 
in 2012, and the pressure to repeat was burdensome for coach Roland Thornqvist. But he feels better this 
time around. 
“This year has 
got a little differ -
ent feel to it,” he 
said. “We feel lighter with no pressure on us, and it’s kind of nice.”
Follow-
ing today’s opener, Florida plays Wednesday against UCF before a challenging February stretch. UF takes on No. 15 Baylor, No. 3 Duke, No. 8 North Carolina, No. 20 Clem-son and No. 5 Stanford. 
“It helps playing all of these 
great teams early in the season,” Embree said. “When you get to the [NCAA Tournament], you kind of know what to expect, so it should help us in our favor.”Florida begins season 
eying third-straight title“I don’t think there was any-
thing wrong with his swing,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He’s a high school senior fac-ing the best amateur talent in the country on a very talented team. He’s certainly, I’m sure, learned a few things. It’s a learning curve. You can’t get to the top of the mountain with-out having some struggles.”
Gushue had a murderer’s 
row of hitters to learn from his freshman year. 
Last year’s lineup was 
downright scary. This year, well, it’s a little 
early to tell.
Let’s hope Gushue took 
some notes, because he needs to be a major run producer this season. 
Florida loses 68.6 percent 
of its RBIs and its top-four on-base-percentage players from a year ago.
Senior Vickash Ramjit, 
sophomore Casey Turgeon and Gushue return as the only hit-ters with a slugging percentage more than .350. 
The Gators will depend on 
Gushue that much more.
 “I’m really pleased where he’s at,” O’Sullivan said. “De-fensively, he’s come light years. He’s going to have to hit in the middle of our order. He’s cer -
tainly capable. We recruited him for a reason. He came here early. He made a huge com-mitment to us, our school and our program. It’s his time to go, and we’re certainly comfort-able with him.”
How Gushue progresses at 
and behind the plate may de-termine how far the Gators go in 2013.

Redshirt freshman Carlie Nee-
dles was lights out against North 
Florida on Nov. 19, breaking Flor -
ida’s program record with nine three-pointers in a 74-44 victory.
But in Southeastern Confer -
ence play, Needles and the Gators have fallen on dark times shoot-ing the ball. 
During UF’s current four-
game losing streak — a slide that has dropped Florida into a tie for 11th in the SEC — Needles has shot just 25 percent from the floor, while making only 6 of 25 attempts from behind the arc. 
“Sometimes you just have 
those games,” Needles said. “You have those games where stuff isn’t falling.”
The Gators’ shortcomings from 
behind the arc have been an issue throughout conference play. Only South Carolina shoots at a lower percentage on three-pointers than Florida. 
UF has made just 22 of 87 at-
tempts or 25.3 percent of its tries, a number emblematic of its offen-sive struggles as a whole.
Though the Gators are a re-spectable seventh in the confer -
ence in scoring — averaging 65.6 points per game — coach Amanda Butler has recently grown frus-trated with her team’s offensive struggles.
Florida’s offensive woes wors-
ened during Sunday’s 69-52 loss to Georgia in Athens, Ga.
For the first time in more than 
two years, no Gator scored in double figures. The last such oc-currence came in an 83-40 loss to Tennessee on Jan. 13, 2011. 
“We’re a little out of sync right 
now,” Butler said. “It’s a combi-nation of things.” 
Butler was correct in choosing 
to not solely focus on one area of offensive struggles. Against the Bulldogs, the Gators were defi-cient in nearly every aspect. 
Florida shot just 5 of 14 from 
the free-throw line and 3 of 16 from behind the arc. 
Butler described the failures 
from the foul line as ridiculous. Concerning three-point shooting, she explained her team must use better discernment moving for -
ward. 
“We’re shooting the ball pretty 
pathetically from the three, so we need to take less threes,” Butler said. “It’s pretty simple. We’ve got to be disciplined enough to turn down some of those open looks.”

Known for its fast greens, 
the Black Diamond Ranch in 
Lecanto provided a challeng-ing test for Florida in its first tournament of 2013. But the Florida Challenge gave the Gators their third team title in the 2012-13 season.
The Gators finished with 
four players in the top 10 to win the one-day 36-hole tour -
nament with a score of 586. Ca-milla Hedberg continued her successful season by carding a two-round total of 143 to tie for first with UCF’s Monifa Sealy.
“This is a great way to start 
the spring season,” coach Em-ily Bastel said in a release. “We can take a lot of positives away from [Monday].”
A new face helped the 
Gators win the Florida Chal-lenge title.  
Elcin Ulu, a transfer student 
from Redlands Community College in Oklahoma, shot a 69 and 77.  Ulu led after the first round, but she finished tied for third with Florida State’s Alex Milan.
“We had some highlights 
individually,” Bastel said in a release. 
“Elcin had a career-low 
69 in the first round, which should be a tremendous confi-dence booster for her.”
Seniors Mia Piccio and Isabelle Lendl also turned in strong rounds to finish tied for eight and 10th, respectively. 
Piccio shot rounds of 75 and 
73, while Lendl continued the most dominant season of her career. 
Lendl finished in the top 10 
for the fifth straight time with rounds of 76 and 73.  
Other Gators making ap-
pearances at the Florida Chal-lenge were senior Megan Pak, sophomore Anna Young, and freshmen Emma Smyser and 
Ursa Ore-hek.
Y o u n g 
had the sec-ond-highest finish of her career after rounds of 74 and 81. She tied for 18th 
with teammate Orehek who shot a 78 and 77. 
 Pak and Smyser both com-
peted as individuals and fin-ished with a 162 and 157, re-spectively. 
“Black Diamond is an awe-
some venue and it was great to compete on such a great golf course,” Bastel said in a release. 
“We will use what we did 
today to work on some more specific things before we head to California (to play in the Northrup Grumman Regional Championship).”Gators win first
