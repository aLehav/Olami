RTS bus,
car collide
* GPD: THE CAR'S DRIVER SUFFERED
'SERIOUS INJURIES.'
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
kbein@alligato r org
An 82-year-old woman was taken to Shands at
UF after a crash involving an RTS bus Monday.
Ann Ruffin was the only person injured in
the crash, according to Gainesville Police Sgt. Joe
Raulerson.
Raulerson said the bus driver and the few pas-
sengers were not hurt in the crash, which hap-
pened at Northwest 23rd Street and West Uni-
versity Avenue at about 2 p.m.
He said Ruffin was driving her 2008 Cadil-
lac eastbound on University Avenue and tried
to turn left onto Northwest 23rd Street when the
RTS bus crashed into her passenger side.
The impact caused major damage to the front
and side of Ruffin's car, shattered the windows
and set off the air bags, Raulerson said.
Ruffin's injuries were serious but not life-
threatening, said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg.
Investigators are trying to determine who was
at fault, he added.

UF announced Monday that a privacy
breach released 25 Social Security numbers.
The numbers are believed to belong to
trainers who worked with the Florida Traf-
fic and Bicycle Safety Education program in
2006.
Officials aren't sure if anyone accessed
the information, but it was found in an un-
protected file last month during a routine
security check, said UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes.
"We are not aware of anyone who has
used it for fraudulent purposes," she said.
The file also contained the names of 34
people, but the names didn't match up with
the Social Security numbers, she said.

Man takes tape, not nap
By PATRICK ANNESTY

Richard D. Humphrey went to jail over
a roll of electrical tape and a bottle of hot
sauce that police say he took from a house-
boat.
At about 4:30 a.m. Monday, a witness
reported seeing Humphrey enter a house-
boat at 3020 N Main St., where it was
parked at Jim Walker Auto Sales, accord-
ing to a police report.
The witness said Humphrey hid inside
the houseboat when he noticed he was be-
ing watched.
Gainesville Police Department officer
Edward Ratliff found Humphrey on the
3900 block of North Main Street.
When confronted, Humphrey said he
entered the houseboat "to take a nap."In Humphrey's front right pocket Rat-
liff found a bottle of hot sauce worth $1,
and in his back left pocket a roll of electri-
cal tape worth $3.
Humphrey admitted to stealing both
items, police said.
Humphrey, 47, of
542 NE Seventh Ave.,
was charged with un-
armed burglary, a fel-
ony, and petit theft, a
misdemeanor.
He was booked at
the Alachua County Jail
at 6:03 a.m. Monday.
GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg said
there was no indication why Humphrey
took the hot sauce and tape.
"Sometimes, intelligence and reason do
not play into [these situations]," Kameg
said.

immerse them-

of the people

finding ways to
make life better
for everyone. They Cammy Abernathy
spend their careers in the service of
others, solving practical problems and
meeting tangible needs. Their passion
for people motivates them to do the
unexpected, attempt the risky and at-
tain the impossible.
The best engineers -the ones truly
destined to make a difference -reflex-
ively reach beyond cultural, temporal
and disciplinary boundaries. They
understand that isolationism is a death
sentence to creativity, but embracing
differences cultivates innovation.
At the University of Florida Col-

culture we encourage, and our students
are heavily recruited as a result. It also
allows us to create new interdisciplin-
ary programs attacking problems from
a variety of perspectives. Because of our
people and our broad array of research
initiatives, our college has the opportu-
nity to be a leader in this new approach
to addressing issues in energy, health
care, sustainable infrastructure and the
environment, information technology,
nanotechnology, and a myriad of other
questions facing society.

has been held as farSomething's fishy about away as Nicaragua
and Ecuador.
this international class
With 90 percent of shrimp being imported to the U.S., American consumers can thank the
University of Florida for keeping their favorite seafood safe, fresh and tasty.
UF's Shrimp School is an annual training program to educate shrimp processors and regula-
tors from all over the world. The three-day training program, organized by Steven Orwell of the
Aquatic Foods Products Lab at UF, has been held each summer since 1995.
"The class is already full for next year," said Laura Garrido, Shrimp School coordinator. "I don't
have to advertise anymore."
The popularity of Shrimp School has spread mostly by word-of-mouth, and students are en-
rolled on a first-come basis. While the ideal class size is 25 students, recent years' classes have been
capped at 50 students.
Attendees often include shrimp suppliers and buyers, plant managers, representatives from
private food labs, vice presidents of quality control and assurance, and chefs. Some of this year's
attendees included representatives from supermarkets, research labs and seafood processors and
distributors. Attendees receive a certificate for completing the course.
"I found Shrimp School to be a very educational experience in many aspects," said Casey
Marion, a seafood specialist at the Jacksonville-based Beaver Street Fisheries, which imports frozen
seafood from more than 50 countries.
The course is taught by UF faculty and U.S. Food and Drug Administration representatives.
"We bring the world experts (to teach the class)," Garrido said.
Shrimp School is taught in a classroom, as well as a lab, to give the students hands-on experi-
ence. In the lab, students perform a sensory evaluation to determine how shrimp should look, feel,
taste and smell.
"Each day we had the opportunity to work with FDA sensory experts who took us on a cali-
bration process of smelling different odor standards that represent the freshest of quality to the
absolute worst smelling odors you can think of," Marion said.

Student's site sells overstock books at 'bailout' prices
* THE SITE OFFERS MORE
THAN 21,000 TITLES.
By ANNIE BOGGS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andrew Koumi took his business
skills from the classroom to the real
world with the launch of recession-
based Web site Bookbama.com.In order to help students strug-
gling with their finances, the site
promises to sell students "bargain
books at bailout brices."
Koumi, a UF senior, purchases
books from publishers who print
too many copies and sells them for
less than half of the original cost.
He said a $15 book can sell for as
little as $2 on his Web site, adding
he offers a variety of books groupedinto categories ranging from "Body,
Mind & Spirit" to "Literary Criti-
cism."
Koumi came up with the idea
for his business after
Local researching the cost
News of opening a textbook
store.
Although he originally operated
his business out of his apartment
closet, he had to relocate his inven-tory to two warehouses in St. Peters-
burg, Fla., and New Jersey.
"(It) kept getting bigger and big-
ger," he said.
Updated each day, the inventory
is now at more than 21,000 books.
Koumi said students looking for
even cheaper books should check
out bargain book bailouts, a weekly
promotion in which he makes 25
random book titles free.Customers must pay shipping
and handling and can order up to
100 free books. Koumi said the pro-
motion has worked because most
customers order regularly priced
books along with their free ones.
Customers are not simply pur-
chasing one or two books as they do
from major bookstores either.
"Most of my customers order
around 15 titles," Koumi said.
GAINESVILLE CITY COMMISSION
Commissioners discuss improvements for transportation
By DALIA SABBAGH
Alligator Writer
The Gainesville City Commission has a
desire named streetcar.
City commissioners voiced ideas like
making the area more pedestrian- and bicy-
cle-friendly, encouraging more bus use and
an creating an electric streetcar system at
their Monday workshop.
Regional Transit System has jumped
from about 1 million passengers in 2000 to
about 9 million this year, said Commission-er Jack Donovan.
"We want to provide the best transpor-
tation we can, meaning clean and reliable,"
Donovan said, adding that he believes it's
possible to restructure University Avenue
without affecting traffic.
Other ideas included a Bus Rapid Tran-
sit, which would operate like a train system
with a prepaid fare, and strengthening the
connection between UF and downtown.
One goal of the workshop was to figure
out whether the project would qualify for
federal funding, Donovan said.
According to the city planning staff, theplan would not cost more than $20 million,
would not have a regional impact and would
Donovannot be completed within
three years of receiving
the grant -all of which
are necessary to qualify
for stimulus funds.
While the broader
plan, including the BRT
and electric streetcar sys-
tems, would far exceed
$20 million, the more im-
mediate goal of landscaping and widening
sidewalks and bicycle lanes would not meetthe $20-million minimum.
Donovan said the project may not be
possible for at least five years.
But he said smaller steps may still be an
option. The development of a lane dedi-
cated to public transportation would ignite
development downtown and help develop-
ers feel safer investing in downtown com-
munities.
"When you have increased population
downtown, businesses find it a good place
to locate," he said. "It really depends on
federal funding, but we'll be paying close
attention to this in the next few years."

Police follow through with seat belt enforcement
By DEREK GILLIAM
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local enforcement of Florida's June seat
belt law is no joke.
During the first month of enforcement,
the Gainesville Police Department issued
24.5 percent more tickets than it did in July
2008, and 32.5 percent more tickets were
given this August than in August 2008.
Before the law went into effect, people
could only be cited for not wearing seat
belts if they were pulled over for another
offense.
Now, it's a primary offense -officers
can pull over a car if the driver or passen-
ger is not wearing a seat belt.
In Alachua County, the fine for notwearing a seat belt is $104.
Thomas Baker, an aerospace engineer-
ing senior, said he thinks the law is an at-
tempt to raise revenue in a bad economy.
"The police department is more like a
bill collector than a law enforcer," Baker
said.
Lauren Profis, a UF freshman, said she
could see why it would be difficult for law
enforcement to effectively enforce seat belt
violations and has some concerns about
abuse.
"I don't know how a police officer could
identify a violation while the car is mov-
ing," Profis said.
But GPD Cpl. Michael West said that at
the speeds cars travel around Gainesville,
it is not difficult to detect a violation.He added that officers must be certain
before they pull someone over for a seat
belt violation.
Failure to wear a seat belt contrib-
utes to more fatalities than any other
single traffic safety-related behavior.
About 63 percent of people killed in au-
tomobile accidents were not wearing seat
belts at the time of their accidents, accord-
ing to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
Amy Meyer, a UF sophomore, said the
increased enforcement is a good sign and
could end up saving lives.
"I have personally known two friends
who died in car crashes," Meyer said.
"They probably would have survived if
they had been wearing their seat belts."Seat Belt

Battle continues over campus radio station content
* THE NEW FORMAT COULD
PRODUCE MORE JOBS.
BY CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Demonstrators held signs and
played cellos last week to show
their opposition to WUFT-FM'schange from classical music to
news and public affairs.
The change, which occurred in
August, has also received posi-
tive feedback from people who
enjoy the news programs, said
Paul Gordon, interim executive
director of UF's Division of Mul-
timedia Properties.
Gordon said the station plansto add more local news cover-
age.
The increase in local coverage
could lead to more
On volunteer and paid
Campus positions at the sta-
tion for students, he
said.
But Sue Yelton, who organized
the protest group, said she missesthe classical, folk, jazz and blues
music the WUFT-FM's old format
offered. The classical music now
offered by the station's HD2 ra-
dio channel does not replace the
old mix, she said.
"I'm not going to tear out my
sound stereo system in my car to
put in an HD radio that I don't
know will work," she said. "Wewant back what we had or some-
thing very similar."
However, Gordon said it is
difficult to get people to agree
with the format change when it is
still so new, and the transition is
going to take time.
"It's a matter of really trying
to expand, but it's a crawl, walk,
run process," he said.

Jail Break
Program gives inmates
opportunity to grow
hen we think of jailhouses, we are more inclined to
think of "The Shawshank Redemption" than "Julie
and Julia."
However, one Florida minimum-security prison is allow-
ing inmates to put their culinary and horticultural skills to
the test.
The Hillsborough County Jail, located in Tampa, allows
inmates to use peppers grown in its horticulture program to
produce hot sauces -with names like "Original," "No Es-
cape," "Smoke" and the yet-to-be-released "Misdemeanor."
The sauces are sold at the jail and online, and all proceeds go
to maintain the program.
We think this is an effective program because it uses no
taxpayer money, allows inmates a bit of self-expression and
leaves them with a certificate in vocational horticulture once
they're out of the slammer.
Plus, the TV spots for the sauces are smokin'.
Because Florida is full of landscaping companies, this pro-
gram presents an employment opportunity for inmates upon
release. And because the certificate doesn't mention that it
was earned inside of a prison, it gives them a leg up in be-
coming productive, working members of society.
For combining the redemptive qualities of cooking, grow-
ing produce and creating a product with the concept that
Andy Dufresne clung to in "Shawshank" -hope -we
would like to commend Hillsborough County Jail for its in-
novative program.
If only the Gainesville man arrested for stealing barbeque
sauce Monday morning was arrested for stealing Jailhouse
hot sauce, we could understand.
Heck, we'd commit a felony to know what "Misdemean-
or" tastes like, too.
Burger King
68-year-old man washonored for 50 years
of service at the
same Missouri McDonald's
last week.
For spending a lifetime
under the golden arches,
Leonard Rhomberg re-
ceived a McFlurry of praise
from his co-workers, who
gave him a cake, gift cards
(to McDonald's) and a St.
Louis Cardinals jersey with
his name across the back.
Things like this keep us
awake at night. Deciding
our futures is tough. Pictur-
ing ourselves as fry-guys
(or girls) for 50 years is Mc-
Frightening.
However, it seems like
Rhomberg might have fig-
ured out a way to avoid any
sort of self-doubt by McLo-
vin' it.
What kind of person does
it take to work at the same
job, without upward mobil-
ity, for 50 years?Is his tenure a tribute to
his dedication and loyalty,
or is it something that im-
plies a serious lack of ambi-
tion?
Being in or around a Mc-
Donald's a few times a year
is almost too much for us,
but that's not the point.
The point is that
Rhomberg proves it is pos-
sible to be content by know-
ing where you belong. The
Rhomberg's photo shows a
smiling man.
We would like to take his
story as an example of the
fact that happiness doesn't
necessarily come from con-
stantly searching for valida-
tion. Sometimes it comes in
the form of a Happy Meal.
Next time you're stressed
about your future, remind
yourself that happiness can
come from dedication and
sticking to what you know,
even if it is flipping burgers
five days a week.

Golden rule a pplies to relationships
had a friend who was really into returning lost things totheir owners. One of my more resonant memories of this
is when she found a teddy bear on the sidewalk.
The bear was in pretty decent condition, albeit a little
dirty, and it had a small, custom-made, inscribed locket
around its neck.
So my friend picked up the teddy bear and took it home.
She did some meticulous do-it-yourself dry cleaning on
the bear, shined up the locket, and hung up some "Found:
One Teddy Bear" fliers near where she found it. She always
handled the teddy bear carefully, washing her hands before
touching it and placing it in a large Ziploc bag to keep it
from getting dirty.
At one point, her mom asked her why she was going
through all this trouble for a stranger's lost stuffed animal.
My friend shrugged and said, "It may not be mine, but I
bet whomever it does belong to would probably like it if it
weren't all fucked up and shit. So I'll take care of it while
I've got it."
And I've always thought that's some of the best 21st-
century relationship advice I've ever heard.
I'll explain.
Our generation seems to get a lot of flak for the tran-
sience of our relationships, as if we consider commitment
obsolete. I guess it's not an entirely indefensible argument.
The ease, for instance, with which we change our Facebook
relationship statuses should give us pause. In fact, there's a
relationship status that codifies non-commitment commit-
ment -the strangely equivocal "It's Complicated."
And if nothing else, think of the phrase "hook up" -an
intentionally cryptic verb that could mean anything from
coffee-having to laid-getting with an ambiguity that serves
the purpose of not committing to much of anything.
But even if our relationship churn rate is higher thanprevious generations, I'm not con-
vinced that this is necessarily a bad
thing. What could be read as non-
commitment could just as easily be
interpreted as an unwillingness to
waste each other's time.
Joe Dellosa This higher churn rate indicates
letters@alligator org that we're meeting, dating and hook-
ing up -whatever that means -
with more people, and that indicates we have more oppor-
tunities to hurt each other.
A cold truth of modern-day relationships is that we're
all probably a little bit damaged. Most everyone has dealt
with significant others, awful breakups and a night of self-
medicating with buffalo wings and Chunky Monkey while
mournfully watching "Garden State." (It's a better idea in
theory than in practice.)
And I'm fully cognizant of the fact that the girl with
whom I'll wind up will probably have had her heart broken
several times before she meets me. But I also know that I'd
really appreciate it if the folks she runs into before me treat
her heart with a little gentleness and a little courtesy so that
she's not too jaded or closed to the idea of love when I meet
her. Knowing that is more than enough reason for me to try
to return the favor when I can. That's the responsibility that
comes with our high relationship churn rate, and it's one to
which I think we're all beholden.
Or, to put it another way: For any person with whom
we're in a relationship, their heart might not ultimately be
ours, but it's a safe bet that whomever it does belong to
would probably like it if it weren't all fucked up and shit.
So let's take care of it while we've got it.

Tuesday.

Kanye's comments break record of idiocy
I have to admit, I usually hate everything
on MTV and refuse to watch it, but when I got
on Facebook and saw no less than 700 statuses
along the lines of "Kanye West at the VMAs
-what a terrible person!" it was of the utmost
importance that I find the video online.
In my opinion, it wasn't Kanye's comments
(which set the bar for idiocy in the way Mi-
chael Phelps breaks his own records at swim
competitions) that were surprising, it was the
fact that Taylor Swift didn't take the chance to
ask him whether or not he liked fish sticks.

Elite Republicans don't make headlines
All right, Mr. Matthew Christ, you have
my attention. In your article, "Republicans
lack intellectual figures," you gave me an op-
portunity to voice my opinion.
In your column, you quoted Winston
Churchill, referring to the knowledge of the
average voter. Not a bad point. Allow me to
further this point by mentioning the past two
presidents America elected, George W. Bush
and Barack Obama. The former was elected
based on moral governing (a very bad idea).
The latter was elected based on "change" from
mostly perceived -and propagated by the
slanted media -incompetence and injustice
perpetrated by the former. Obama won the
election despite clearly lacking a viable plan to
accomplish this "change."
That point being made, let me state that 53
percent of American voters voted for Obama.
Moving on -where are the intellectualRepublicans? We are here; we just don't get
attention. We use logic and reason to form
our opinions and arguments instead of emo-
tions. The left should try this sometime. In ad-
dition, we get shouted down often by those
who claim they are proponents of free speech.
As you know, this doesn't make headlines like
saying,"police acted stupidly." Ever heard
of the saying, "the squeaky wheel gets the
grease"? We don't have time to be squeaky
because we're too busy working hard and em-
bracing individual responsibility.
We are the productive members of society
who so often get overlooked because we're not
protesting on the corner and we
for handouts.

Most scholarships already need-based
I know the Florida Bright Futures Scholar-
ship Program is flawed, but under no circum-
stances should it become an entirely need-
based program. What Kyle Robisch fails to
realize is that basically all of the scholarships
available for Florida students are need-based.
I worked extremely hard in high school, and it
paid off in the form of an extremely high SAT
score, a 4.3 GPA, passing five out of six AP ex-
ams and becoming a sports captain. However,
when it came to scholarships, I received a mea-
sly $500 after applying for about 20. The vast
majority of scholarships have a need-based
component. I don't see how my parent's salary
has anything to do with how much I achieved
in high school. If we make everything need-
based, it will discourage students from doing
well in school and push them to attend schools
that are less scholastically renowned.
Had I not gotten 100 percent Florida
Brights, I probably would have ended up at
Florida State University or the University of
Central Florida, because they offer thousands
of dollars to well qualified students. The state
should make it more difficult for students
to receive 75 percent, not punish those who
worked hard and deserve to be rewarded.

Gators use Joker package to maximize team speed
Matt Tripp / Alligator Staf
Junior Justin Trattou (94) lined up at nose tackle in UF's 3-3-5 Joker formation during Florida's 56-6 win over Troy or
Saturday. The "Joker" package puts a trio of defensive ends and safeties on the field.

Moody not out of picture
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
A year ago, Emmanuel Moody's career
at Florida was headed in the right direc-
tion.
Moody was named the Gators' start-
ing running back against Tennessee last
season, and he finished with a game-high
55 yards on nine carries. But an ankle in-
jury soon after caused him to miss three
games, and Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps
combined for 487 yards and four touch-
downs in his absence.
Moody has never regained the starting
role, and he tallied just one carry -a fum-
ble -last week against Troy. Despite ap-
parently benching Moody for the fumble,
UF coach Urban Meyer says he still plans
to play the redshirt junior as the season
goes on.
"When you put your mind into some-
one whose whole world is carrying the
football and playing at Florida, then it
goes: injury, fumble, this and this," Meyersaid. "I certainly have not lost confidence
inhim, we just have to get him right."
INJURY UPDATE: Meyer said defensive
tackle Lawrence Marsh (ankle) is prob-
able for this weekend's game against
Tennessee and he also expects receiver
Deonte Thompson
(hamstring) to play,
though he may miss a
few days of practice.
TEBOW TAKES HONOR:
Quarterback Tim
Tebow was named
Moody Southeastern Con-
ference Offensive Player of the Week
on Monday. The senior completed 15
of 24 passes for 237 yards and four
touchdowns and added 71 yards and
a touchdown running. He is second in
the nation in passing efficiency (197.95)
behind Arkansas' Ryan Mallett (210.25).

Florida's 3-3-5 defense couldn't be more aptly named.
Like the playing card it derives its name from, the Joker
package isn't one of the most common defensive forma-
tions, but it can wreak havoc on opposing offenses and al-
ways has the potential to create a big play.
The biggest difference is the Gators are always holding
the wild card, and their speed and versatility allow them to
play it at any time.
"It's more fun because you can make more plays, espe-
ciallywhenyou're rushing them," linebacker Ryan Stamper
said. "We cover really well, and when they
throw the ball, it gives us a better chance to
make interceptions. It seems like we make
more plays when we're in that package,
and that's why I love it so much."Football That held true in Saturday's 56-6 win
against Troy, when Florida's defense
mostly operated from the Joker package. The results were
promising: three turnovers, three sacks and just 71 yards
allowed in the first half.
The 3-3-5 plays perfectly to the Gators' strengths. It
keeps all three talented safeties -Ahmad Black, Major
Wright and Will Hill -on the field, increases the depth
of the defensive line and showcases the athletic ability of
the defensive backs and linebackers, as they can blitz the
quarterback or drop into coverage.
Defensive end Carlos Dunlap is used for his pass-
rushing skills and his wingspan, as his 6-foot-6, 290-pound
frame is helpful in pass coverage as well.
There's a lot of movement before the snap, which makes
it tough to tell where the pressure will come from.

PHIL, from page 14
of 2008's Big 12 rushing leader, Kendall
Hunter, due to a right leg injury. Anoth-
er set of fans sent into despair.
One fan base's hopelessness, how-
ever, is another team's opportunity.
Could BYU, currently ranked No. 9
in the coaches' poll, be the first school
from outside an automatic-qualifier
conference to finish in the Top 5 of the
BCS Standings?
With home games still to play
against Florida State, TCU and Utah, I
say absolutely. But there's still no way
an undefeated BYU makes it into the
BCS National Championship Game in
Pasadena unless Florida or Texas drop
a game.
The No. 1 Gators and No. 2 Long-
horns aren't impenetrable to injury.
Any given play could cause Florida
or Texas fans to gasp and question the
heavens. After all, Oklahoma's darling
quarterback probably didn't return to
Norman to have his national title hopes
dashed on a single hit, and Tim Tebow
and Colt McCoy don't exactly shy away
from contact when they roll out of the
pocket.
Here in Gainesville, fans should wor-
ry about others in addition to Tebow. At
least No. 15 has a backup -the Gatorsdon't even bother listing a reserve tight
end on their depth chart, making Aaron
Hernandez one of the most irreplace-
able members of the team.
There isn't exactly the usual stable
of wide receivers, either. Only Riley
Cooper (10 catches for 187 yards in two
games) and Deonte Thompson (2 TDs
against Troy) have proven themselves
so far, with Hernandez second on the
team in receptions.
Redshirt senior David Nelson has
only three catches for 13 yards, and I
can't see Brandon James being more
than an occasional option, despite his
over-the-shoulder TD catch Saturday.
Injury isn't the only thing that can
derail games or change a season's path.
How about the weather?
It seems like a silly thought, until
you remember that the Gators' offense
had six fumbles Saturday and looked
completely pathetic in the rain during
the first quarter against Troy.
You just never know.
So I look forward to watching BYU
put its national title game hopes on the
line each week, starting with Saturday's
home contest against Florida State.
Keep winning, and a fan base from
Provo, Utah, can keep dreaming one
week at a time. It might never happen,
but college football continues to show
nothing is certain.
3-3-5 formation wreaks havoc on opponents passing games but vulnerable to run
JOKER, from page 14
"We really disguise a lot," de_
fensive line coach Dan McCarney
said. "Sometimes you'll see two
guys with their hands on the line of
scrimmage with nine guys stand-
ing, and they're moving around. We
talk about being moving targets and
bringing them from all areas and dif-
ferent places. There's a rhyme and a
reason for everything we do."
The Joker package causes chaos,
the perfect environment for the
Gators' opportunistic defense. The
unit was third in the nation in take-
aways last season, and its streak of
14-straight games with an intercep-
tion leads the nation (the next closest
teams are tied at nine).
Turnovers were a huge benefit
for UF last year, and the Joker pack-
age will help ensure that trend con-
tinues. But it does have its faults.Florida's Joker Package

vulnerable against a good rushing in the BCS Championship Game,
game. The Gators used it heavily but when Tennessee rolls into town
against Oklahoma's passing attack Saturday, it'll likely be used only inpassing situations.
"It's no secret what [the Volun-
teers] are going to do," UF coach Ur-
ban Meyer said. "They're going to
come in with two really good backs
and try to pound us and come after
us running the ball.
"I don't believe they're going to
come in and try to wing it all over
the place to try and win the game.
We have good cover guys, but we
have to stop the run. If it starts to be
a downhill game, we have a prob-
lem."
But if the Gators can stop the
Volunteers' ground game, the Joker
package will be especially useful
on third downs. UT has an inexpe-
rienced receiving corps and a quar-
terback, Jonathan Crompton, who
managed more touchdowns than in-
terceptions just twice last season and
threw three picks last week against
UCLA.
