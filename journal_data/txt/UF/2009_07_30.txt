Beginning Monday, airtime on WUFT-FM, 
the UF-owned radio station that plays mainly 
classical music, will consist almost entirely of National Public Radio programming. The changes, which could result in layoffs 
next month, are part of an effort to offer stu-dents more experience in broadcasting news and to bring in more money and listeners for the station, said John Wright, dean of UF’s College of Journalism and Communications, which runs the station.
Formerly Classic 89, the station will go by only its official name, WUFT-FM. By mid-Sep-tember, Dean Wright said students should be 
broadcasting during two hour-long news blocks every day.
“The idea is for students to 
leave this college and be ahead 
of the curve,” he said.
Dean Wright said even though he foresees a decrease in audience at first, he expects it to eventually rebound and expand.
“It’s happened at every single station that’s 
made this transformation across the country,” he said.
In the first year, operational costs could in-
crease by about $5,000, even though NPR will

There won’t be a full moon Saturday, but guests can cel-
ebrate the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission and 
the first walk on the moon with marshmallow MoonPies.
The Kika Silva Pla Planetarium and the Alachua Astron-
omy Club Inc. will host a Lunar Festival from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. at Santa Fe College campus.
Although the anniversary falls on July 20, planetarium 
specialist Kristin Fiaccato said the festival was postponed until the moon was fuller 
and could be viewed better. 
The moon will be in the waxing gib-
bous stage, one stage away from being a full moon, Fiaccato said. 
From 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. telescopes will 
be available to view the moon, Saturn and Jupiter.
Lead NASA system engineer for the 
Apollo 11 mission, Bill Helms, who is also president of the astronomy club, will speak about the history and signifi-
cance of the Apollo Lunar Landing Program. 
There will be arts and crafts, a bounce house and a free 
planetarium show for children. 
The festival will be free to the public, with the excep-
tion of a light show, which costs $4 for adults and $3 for 
children and seniors.

Competitors will whip up sweet 
potato pies, throw down with step 
dance, get in the groove to African 
drumming and toss out poetic vers-es Saturday at the Homowo African 
Festival in Gainesville.
The Homowo is a traditional 
festival of Ghana, a West African nation, which honors the past year of the moon, sun and life-sustaining food.
“This is the time when you come together and forgive indi-
viduals with a handshake and 
a hug,” said Ay-
oka Jasey, the 
event coordinator.
Vendors will sell African prod-
ucts including shea butter, drums, masks and food from the Caribbe-an, Nigeria and Ghana, she said. 
Boluwatife Akinyemi, president 
of the African Student Union at UF, said her organization will attend and her mother will serve tradition-al Nigerian food.
“I think it’s a great opportunity to really showcase different sides of African culture,” Akinyemi said.
The festival will be held by the 
African community of Gainesville from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Garden of Beginning, 19024 NE 21st St. Competitions will begin at 2 p.m.SANTA FE COLLEGE

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate 
debate over Supreme Court nominee So-
nia Sotomayor turned bitter Wednesday, after Democrats warned the GOP it would pay a steep price for opposing the judge who would be the first Hispanic justice, and a top Republican charged they were playing destructive racial politics.
Majority Leader Harry Reid implored 
Republicans Wednesday to join Demo-crats in voting to confirm Sotomayor next week, warning that GOP opposition would bring the same sort of public back-lash that followed the party’s spirited op-position to measures that would have given some illegal immigrants a chance to gain legal status.
“I just think that their voting against 
this good woman is going to treat them about the same way that they got treated as a result of their votes on immigration,” said Reid, D-Nev.

Rape reported Thursday 
after two years
An on-campus rape that was 
reported Thursday apparently oc-
curred about two years ago.
The woman, who is no longer 
a student, was a senior at the time of the alleged rape,  University Po-
lice Department Lt. Darren Baxley 
said.
She was 22 years old when it 
happened, he said.
She told police that an acquain-
tance raped her in a dark, wooded 
area of campus, though she is not 
sure exactly where on campus it 
was.
“We’re working with her to fig-
ure out where it happened,” Bax-
ley said.
He said it wasn’t clear why 
she’s not sure of the location or 
why she waited so long to report the alleged rape.
“It’s hard to say,” Baxley said. 
“I think maybe she’s just finally 
worked up the courage and wants 
somebody to know about it.”

James Chamberlain decided 
to protest the 130-meal limit at 
the St. Francis House when he 
heard the story of a pregnant 
woman who was turned away 
from a meal. She was the 131st 
person of the day, he said.
“Based on moral, ethical stan-
dards alone, if she’s pregnant 
and hungry, let her eat,” said Chamberlain, from Catholic Ac-tion Resource Exchange, the or-ganization that put the protest 
together.
About 30 to 50 people 
marched from the St. Francis 
House and ended at the steps of 
City Hall, where protesters spoke 
out against the limits Tuesday.
The 130-meal limit is enforced 
by the city because St. Francis House set a 130 limit when they initially applied to obtain a spe-
cial-use permit allowing them to 
serve more than 20 meals a day, 
said Bob Woods, Gainesville 
spokesman. 
Religious organizations such 
as St. Francis House can serve no more than 20 meals without a special-use permit.County Commissioner Rod-
ney Long has spoken against the restriction, and Mayor Pe-
geen Hanrahan has advocated 
a temporary lifting of the limits, 
Chamberlain said.
Long and Hanrahan did not 
return phone calls.
Kent Vant, executive director 
of the St. Francis House, said the 
special-use per-
mit is renewed every five 
years by the city planning board.
When re-
newing the permit earlier 
this year, Vant asked about re-
moving or increasing the limit.
The planning board told him 
that only the City Commission 
has the authority to change the permit’s limit, he said. The city planning board can only renew it. 
Chamberlain is confident that 
his cause will succeed.
“It’s not a matter of if it’s 
lifted,” he said. “It’s a matter of 
when, and we believe that with 
our collective voice it will be 
sooner rather than later.”AROUND GAINESVILLELocals protest St. Francis House’s 130-meal limitTHURSDAY, JULY 30, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Former Gainesville Police Department Of-
ficer William Billings, who embezzled from 
GPD and solicited prostitutes on the job, has received his sentence. 
After a judge found him guilty of scheming 
to defraud and official misconduct, Billings 
received 24 months probation and will not 
be allowed to enter Gainesville and Alachua County’s mapped prostitution areas, said State 
Attorney’s Office spokesman Spencer Mann. Billings will also need to take an HIV test 
and provide a DNA sample to 
the court.
Mann said Billings will have 
to pay restitution to the state by 
giving back the amount of money that he stole through falsifying pay role and for the cost of the investigation.
 Capt. Lynne Benck, who led the investiga-
tion, said Billings stole over $6,000.
In total, he will pay more than $14,500.A GPD internal affairs report stated that 
14 women said they had sex with Billings for money while he was on duty.Former GPD officer receives 24-month probation

� PARKING TICKETS WILL NOW COST $20.
By PATRICK ANNESTY
Alligator Writer
The city has avoided raising property taxes in fa-
vor of adjustments such as higher fines for parking 
tickets and false burglary alarms.
A parking ticket will cost $20 instead of $15, and 
the second false burglary alarm will now cost $60, up 
from $26.25, said Bob Woods, spokesman for the City of Gainesville.
In addition to the increased fines, the city resolved 
a $7.1 million deficit with budget cuts to city depart-ments. The budget year begins Oct. 1.
A proposed cut to reduce the budget for cultural 
activities by 10 percent was voted down by the City Commission. Funding for the Hippodrome State The-atre will remain at its current level.
City Commissioner Jack Donovan said one of the 
largest cuts reduced the annual pay raise of city em-
ployees.
City employees typically re-
ceive an annual raise of 3 per-cent, he said. For next year, that 
number has been reduced to 1 percent, saving the city $900,000.
The city saved an additional $900,000 by delaying 
the construction of a new fire station.  
The opening of the station was pushed back to the 
end of 2010, after the next fiscal year, he said.
One city employee will be laid off due to budget 
changes, but a number of vacant positions will re-main available, Donovan said.
In addition, the city will offer early retirement to 
employees with more than 17 years of service. Nor-mally, city retirement benefits are awarded after 20 years.
If any employees choose to retire early, the city 
would not immediately seek to fill their vacancies, a process that could save $340,000, Donovan said.
Rather than close the city-owned Ironwood golf 
course, which Donovan said will incur $750,000 in 
losses next year, the commission voted to increase 
the green fees by $5 per round.
The city now has a balanced budget. The proposed 
millage rate, which determines how much landown-ers pay in property tax, will not increase, Donovan 
said.City increases

A UF professor arrested in January 
while trying to trade cocaine for sexual 
favors pleaded not guilty to the charges earlier this month.
Michael Heckenberger, 47, an associ-
ate professor in UF’s Department of An-thropology, was charged with sale of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a church, a felony, on Jan. 17 after an of-ficer in his patrol car watched him throw a bag on the street, according to a police report.
The substance in the bag field-tested 
positive for cocaine, the report stated.Heckenberger said the cocaine wasn’t 
his. He told police he was “curious” and wanted to trade it for sexual favors from 
a man he had been standing with.
The arrest hap-
pened about 450 feet away from the Pro-gressive Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ in northwest Gainesville.
A UF employee 
since 1999, Hecken-
berger was placed on paid administra-
tive leave in February, according to UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando. Heckenberger draws a salary of almost $72,000, accord-ing to UF records.His arrest happened four days after 
his probation for a possible drunk driv-ing incident was cut short by the court.
In January of 2008, he was pulled over 
at 2 a.m., and the arresting officer noted 
in the police report that he “showed signs 
of impairment and admitted to drinking a few beers.” Heckenberger refused to perform field sobriety tests and did not consent to a breathalyzer test.
Last July, after pleading no contest to 
reckless driving, his license was revoked for six months. Heckenberger also agreed to one year supervised probation, almost 
$600 in fines and court costs, 50 hours of 
community service, alcohol safety classes and random drug and alcohol screen-ings.Professor pleads not guilty to felonyGainesville Cit yGovernment

The days of Santa Fe College renting UF 
facilities to accommodate its performing 
arts will soon be over.
This August, SFC will begin construc-
tion on a $17 million fine arts hall at its 
northwest campus. 
“We can hardly wait to open the doors to this facility,” said Alora Haynes, chair-woman of the Santa Fe College Fine Arts program. “My faculty and students on 
campus have deserved this facility for a 
long time.”
Projected to open in January 2011, the 
new facility has been under development 
for three years and will be 39,599 square 
feet, said Rebecca Rogers, director of fa-cilities planning at SFC.
Students can watch the building’s con-
struction through a webcam provided by SFC.
Currently, the 10 groups that perform on SFC campus are confined to an audito-rium with less than 300 seats for its audi-ence members.
“Many high school auditoriums are 
better than our current facili-
ties,” Haynes said. 
The new performing arts 
center will have 600 seats 
across the floor and balcony, along with 
some of the best acoustics in Gainesville, she said.
The new facility will be funded by pri-
vate donations and money the college bor-
rowed through bonds. SFC also plans to raise money by selling seats that people 
can  have their names engraved on.
Haynes said the new fine arts hall will 
not be in competition with other venues in 
the area.
“We exist for the purpose of the aca-
demic programs,” she said.
As for the first show in January of 2011, 
Haynes would not comment on any specif-
ics.
“We have a production already in 
mind,” she said. “It will be very interna-tional and represent music, theater, dance 
and art.”

After heated debate, a bill 
granting online access to resumes 
and records of potential ap-
pointees was passed at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. 
The bill was initially designed 
to allow any student to view the 
information online, but authors 
changed the bill so that only stu-dent senators can view it. 
“The intent behind the bill is 
good, but if we can have senators access it, why not anyone else?” asked Sen. Ben Cavataro. “It ac-tually makes it harder to place restrictions than it does to make 
it available to everyone.”
Nick Mildebrath, co-author of the bill, said the changes were 
made in an effort to comply with 
the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act. 
“FERPA dictates that in order 
to release records, a person has 
to designate a small, specifically defined group,” Mildebrath said. “The entire UF student body isn’t one.”
Limiting online access to Sen-
ate officials follows FERPA more closely, Mildebrath said, but he would have liked to see access for 
all UF students. 
Students are still able to ac-
cess documents by visiting the 
Student Government office in the Reitz Union. 
“Besides, I don’t think stu-
dents really care that much about the information,” Sen. Josh Rob-erts said. “Call me skeptical.” 
Senate also rejected an Orange 
and Blue bill titled “Student Gov-ernment Ethics and Accountabil-
ity Act.”
Sen. Ashton Charles, echoing 
the sentiments of 
several senators, 
said the bill was 
unnecessary be-
cause much of it was covered in the 300 existing 
codes that gov-
ern senators’ 
behavior.
The bill aimed at applying eth-
ical standards to all branches of SG, not just the legislative branch, Sen. Alden Gillespy said. The bill also included stronger 
anti-discrimination rules to help 
protect students applying for SG 
positions.
“Over the past year, SG offi-
cials have filmed campaign vid-
eos in their offices and traded e-mails about how they can divvy up positions based on affiliation, not merit,” Cavataro said in a 
press release.
University Police Department 
Capt. Jeff Holcomb attended the 
meeting to inform senators that 
Student Nighttime Auxilliary 
Patrol will run until 3 a.m. begin-
ning in the fall, extending its ser-
vice by an hour.
“I’d like to give a lot of credit 
to Jordan Johnson for that,” Hol-comb said. “When I say credit, I’d like to say blame because to be honest, I was trying to avoid 
this, but it has been passed, and 
we’re going full force in the fall.”
Holcomb said his hesitation 
stemmed from the added stress 
an extra hour will cause for SNAP staff. 
“It’s a pretty good stretch on 
our staff to work from 6 p.m. to 3 
or 3:30 a.m.,” he said. 
Press Secretary Eric Conrad 
said SG administration is in the 
beginning phases of its DUI pre-
vention program. 
A kickoff this fall will include 
promotions with the Regional 
Transit System Later Gator, SNAP, local taxi companies and the new scooter pick-up service, he said. Santa Fe College to construct $17M fine arts hall

GPD sentencing doesn’t 
fit the crime
Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgToday’s question: Did former GPD Lt. Bill 
Billings receive a puny sentence?The results of Tuesday’s question are unavailable due to technical error.Guest column
Better to tax services than the richFormer Gainesville Police Department Lt. Bill Billings 
has finally faced the music.
Well, at least partially.
If he was facing “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club 
Band,” he would have to own up to Mr. Kite before the needle of judgment was removed from atop his head.
For those who don’t remember, Billings was the subject 
of an internal investigation in February when his fellow officers reported that he was soliciting prostitutes while on the job.
The investigation revealed, however, that he also com-
mitted payroll fraud that amounted to just more than 
$5,000. Billings was supposedly “recruiting” officers in 
other cities and was getting paid overtime to do so. It turns out that what he was doing on the city’s dime was closer to giving local prostitutes a shot of his love.
After seven months of investigations (oh, bureaucrats), 
Lt. Billings has finally been sentenced. According to Al-ligator archives, State Attorney Bill Cervone said Billings would face up to five years in prison for felony theft charg-es and up to a year for prostitution charges. So what did he 
get? The full six years? A three-year compromise?
Nope. Billings faces 24 months of probation. Hardly 
hard time if you ask us. Billings does, however, have to 
pay a restitution charge of almost $15,000.
Additionally, he loses certain rights due to his con-
victed felon status. However, nowhere in the sentencing does it address the fact that Billings solicited prostitutes. They got one thing right with making him pay the restitu-tion but also something very wrong by not addressing the 
prostitution.
Not to mention that two of the women who testified 
against Billings were 13 and 14 when they were solicited. 
No commentary is really needed there, but it does hammer 
home the point that Billings needs to face a punishment 
more serious than probation. Sleeping with a 13-year-old is heinous. Doing it with money stolen from the city of Gainesville is ridiculous. But, what’s even more henious and ridiculous is when it’s utterly ignored. 
Billings’ former cohort, Dave Reveille, faces hard pris-
on time. Reveille was the officer who not only had sex with prostitutes while on the job, but did so forcibly. Obvious-ly, rape is much more serious than “merely” soliciting, so 
the guy definitely deserves it.
However, Reveille only got in trouble for it at the same 
time Billings’ investigation started. A previous investiga-
tion occurred in 2005 but was apparently dropped and forgotten.
This story hasn’t stolen our innocence (you know, like 
how Billings stole the innocence of a 13-year-old girl). We know that just because someone has a badge doesn’t mean that they are morally sound. In fact, a lot of times it works 
the other way.
However, it does sadden us that when GPD investi-
gates an internal crime this serious, they could allow it to 
slip between the cracks. And, when they do catch some-one, the consequences are nil. 
But whatever, the record will play on. (And instead of 
Mr. Kite topping the bill, the people of Gainesville will be paying it.)Brian Miller’s column in Thursday’s Alligator showed 
his complete ignorance of basic economics and fed-eral revenue code.
Miller would have it that we tax only the rich — at ab-
surdly high levels — and have them carry the entire bur-den of taxation while the poor ride free. While this sce-nario works wonders in magical, happy Progressiveland, where gumdrop rivers flow to hospitals that provide free health care, this is a terrible idea in the real world.
The fact is that the rich already pay huge shares of the 
taxes. The wealthiest Americans — the top 1 percent — 
pay 35 percent of all taxes in America.
The not rich — half of all Americans — pay only 4 per-
cent of the taxes. By some estimates, a full 43 percent of all 
Americans pay no federal taxes at all. The revenue code is wrought with so many exemptions, deductions and re-
fundable credits (read: free money) that only the wealthy 
pay federal tax as it is.
Yet Miller would have us further shift this burden by 
removing the sales tax and only taxing the rich.
The super wealthy currently pay a marginal rate of 46 
percent in some states. With coming Obama tax increases, 
that will jump another 10 points.
If the government took 56 percent of every dollar you 
earned, what would you do?
Easy! You wouldn’t earn it!Money at that rate is often not worth earning. People 
instead don’t do the extra work, send the money to off-shore accounts or funnel the money into stock options and benefits.
The rich are worse off, and the government has less 
money. Everyone loses.
You can’t tax the rich forever, Brian Miller. Everybody 
should pay his or her fair share in taxes instead of punish-ing the successful.
The sales tax, however, is 
a much fairer tax. It taxes con-sumption — something every-
one does — at an equal rate across the board. The poor actually spend less of their consumption in sales tax be-cause more income goes to necessities, which are usually exempt.
So when the rich buy a yacht or eat a steak for dinner, 
they pay tax on it like everyone else.
And when they take the money and invest it into com-
panies that create jobs or drive technological growth, they 
pay even a bigger tax on it — 25 percent. They are hardly 
“tax free” as Miller’s lies would have you believe.
A sales tax falls on everyone: locals, tourists, rich, poor, 
businessmen and drug dealers. No one can avoid it be-
cause everyone consumes. It ensures everyone pays a fair 
share of tax on everything they consume. Only dollars that 
are not spent on consumption and are directed toward in-vestment are exempt, as they should be.
Miller does raise one valid point — services are exempt 
from sales tax. But instead of raising taxes on the rich to make up for this, we should expand the sales tax to in-clude services, so that special interests don’t receive pref-erential treatment. This extra revenue would allow us to lower the tax rate across the board.
Miller cannot comprehend that taxing the rich hurts 
the economy holistically. A sales tax taxes everyone at an equal level based on what they choose to consume. If peo-ple choose not to consume and instead invest their money, everybody wins.
No, it’s not very progressive. But like most things not 
progressive, it works.

Guest column
Plan will diminish health care
Universal health care.
The mere mention of it sends its 
advocates scurrying to change the 
subject or hide behind sound bites. There 
are so many lies circulating with regard to 
health care that only a trusted and credible 
institution can dispel them. Unfortunately, we must make due with CNN.
When CNNMoney.com took a close 
reading of the more than 2,000 pages in the House and Health Committee bills, it found five important factors that “con-tradict the president’s assurances.” These contradictions, of course, are different 
from the president having lied (repeat-
edly) to the American people about the bill because lying would have required that he had known what was in it to begin with.
Under these bills, CNN states that you 
lose the ability to customize your health plan, choosing from a pre-approved (and noncompetitive) group of plans stuffed full of useless fees for lobbied provisions. 
Best part? You won’t even know what your 
state requires until this bill becomes law.
Under the promise of no longer charg-
ing more for those with chronic health con-ditions, those who live healthy lifestyles would see drastic increases in their fees. As CNN put it, “It’s as if car insurers had to charge the same rates to safe drivers as to chronic speeders with a history of acci-
dents.”
The government would virtually elimi-
nate health spending accounts by requiring 
low-deductible plans. Because HSA users represent the only modicum of efficiency in health care, we’d be destroying any sort of incentive to not casually consume health care resources. 
President Obama stated on July 16 (and numerous times be-fore and since) that “… you can keep your doctor, you can 
keep your plan. Nobody is talking about 
taking that away from you.”
Well, that’s true, but only for five years 
and only if you’re covered by the Employ-
ee Retirement Income Security Act. After this “grace period,” the government forces you into a “qualified plan.” If you have the bad luck to not work for a Fortune 500-sized megacompany, you lose your health care even sooner. The second your 
plan changes in any way — we’re talking 
co-pays, premiums, coverage range, ad-justed rates, deductibles… anything at all — you go onto a “qualified plan.” 
You can’t keep your doctor, either. Under the Senate version, they de-
vised “medical homes” where your new assigned doctor controls all access to spe-cialists and testing. They decide when you 
“really” need a CT scan or an operation. 
Their job is to promote cost-efficiency. 
During his health care broadcast, 
Obama accused doctors of backing ex-pensive treatment to make money. Now, we’ll have government denying expensive treatment to save money! “Why use an ex-pensive test for cancer when there’s a 60 percent chance the patient doesn’t have it? 
…Best to just wait and see!” 
Many people support this bill. They 
wave their little signs, shouting “health care 
is a right!” But they are confused. A “right” is different from an entitlement. Rights are what even the government cannot take from you… and if this bill passes, the gov-ernment can and will take your health.

Speaking OutSG should not determine content
During last Tuesday’s Student Gov-
ernment Senate meeting, I was rather 
disturbed by certain comments that were made asking the Alligator to not report the events that transpired. Indeed, the 
reporter was specifically singled out and 
told to withhold publishing that the ma-jority party voted down a string of pro-posed ethics legislation when they had done just that.
Although I am just a replacement 
senator serving the honorable constitu-ents of District D, I feel I must continually demur these alarming statements. Senate 
is not an opaque body of government, al-
beit there are many who attempt to push it in that direction, and the Alligator not only has the right but the responsibility to publish what was discussed, deliber-ated and determined at the meeting. Complaints against this paper seem to be frequently resonating during Senate meetings and have become more and 
more appalling. The Alligator should not 
have to put up with those attempting to bash the paper’s journalistic integrity. The Alligator should continue to report the facts, no matter what.
Grievances against the paper then are 
grievances against fact. Obviously the majority party has some soul-searching to do if they are not complacent about 
facts discussed during Senate meetings.

3LSColumn allows Obama crush to                        
overshadow common sense
Matthew Christ’s column Tuesday 
was tired and a failed attempt at enter-
taining readers.
I understand if Mr. Christ wants to 
diverge from serious subjects, but surely there is more than a few comedic ele-
ments happening these days.
President Obama is laughably trying 
to convince the masses that his support of “health care reform” is predicated to lower costs and provide more coverage 
while costing you nothing. Guffaw! Of 
course a public option plan that doesn’t have to turn a profit will compete with 
private plans that do! That’s called free 
markets in action! ROFL!
Remember that zinger he kept repeat-
ing like a broken parrot during the cam-paign that “95 percent of Americans will see a tax cut”? Under his administration? 
HAHAHA! Suckers! Taxing businesses 
(you know,where people work) isn’t the same as taxing, uh, individuals!
I’m certain Mr. Christ has those giant 
cartoon hearts in his eyes for this admin-istration and therefore can’t see anything 
they’re doing as even remotely con-
tradictory. He’s boring, and I’m bored reading him.
I’m taking a nap until his crush is 
over and he can find something current to find funny.

Gainesville residentLetters to the Editornot charge UF for the programming. 
In the second year, when UF will start paying for the new content, he said costs to purchase programming could increase by about $28,000, he said.
If listenership increases enough, 
programming costs could escalate by about 15 percent a year, he said, but the subsequent increase in donations would offset the cost. 
He said current data shows that 
the number of people listening to the station drops by up to 70 percent at 9 a.m. on weekdays, which is when the 
station switches from NPR’s Morning 
Edition to music.
Although some have argued the 
drop occurs because most people start work at 9 a.m., Dean Wright said the data shows that other stations in Gainesville don’t see a similar dip.
He said the station’s new pro-
gramming will help fill a niche that’s 
lacking in the community.
“Some stations do a little bit of 
news, and they do a lot of talk ra-
dio,” he said. “There’s really not an-other viable radio news operation in Gainesville.”
And he said listeners who prefer 
classical music over news can still get their fix on HD-2, one of the station’s 
three high definition channels, which 
requires an HD radio receiver.
The coverage area of the HD chan-
nel is large, he said, but it doesn’t match the main station’s reach. Though he couldn’t make an exact comparison, he said the HD-2 chan-
nel’s range was more than half of the 
main station’s.
He said listeners who want to buy 
an HD receiver can get one for about $50 and that the college is negotiating for better deals with NPR and retail store Best Buy.
In some cases, the station might 
be able to offer the receivers for about $25, he said, though he admitted the situation wasn’t ideal for some.
“[Though] it’s a pretty reasonable cost, even that for people on fixed in-comes can be very problematic,” he said.
The changes have prompted push-
back from devoted classical music fans, and Dean Wright admits he’s received more negative than positive 
feedback regarding the changes.
Alice Wright, program assistant at 
UF’s registrar’s office, said news can 
be repetitive because it’s accessible in ways other than the radio.
“People need more music,” she 
said. “It’s soothing and relaxing.”
Wright also said constant news can be overwhelming after tragedy occurs.
“[News] is all doom and gloom,” 
she said. “That’s what I call it.”
Paul Richards, an associate profes-
sor in UF’s College of Fine Arts, called the change a tragedy.
The switch goes against UF’s mis-
sion, he said, which should be the preservation of culture.
“Lack of access to art in any form 
in a society is not healthy for that so-ciety,” he said.

� THE USDA AWARDED 
SEVEN GRANTS IN ALL.
By ABBIE PARKER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two UF professors received 
more than half a million dollars 
for research, and they’re leav-
ing it up to the students to do the legwork. 
The $643,000 grant, one of 
seven of its kind given by the 
U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture, will fund research on wood that can be used to make 
biofuel like ethanol and may 
result in developing crops to be 
used for creating energy.
College of Forest Resources 
and Conservation assistant pro-
fessor Matias Kirst and associ-
ate professor Gary Peter have 
worked on the project since 
2002. The grant will allow them to bring more focus to their re-
search, Kirst said.
“It’s a pretty difficult pro-
gram to get money from; its 
nature is competitive because 
everyone is researching plants 
right now,” he said. 
The professors will analyze 
and organize data and advise 
the student researchers, he said, 
because their full-time teach-
ing positions also do not allow 
them to research full time.
A team of two graduate stu-
dents and two to four under-graduate students will conduct the research and experiments and meet with Kirst and Peter 
daily for advising.
“We’ll coach the students 
through the experiments,” Pe-
ter said, “but they’ll be doing all the work.”
Kirst said the grant will al-
low students to get involved, which will hopefully foster an interest in science.
“We have [students from] 
engineers who are great with computers to biological ma-
jors and even unrelated majors like journalism students who just want to see what science is all about,” he said.
Evandro Novaes, a Ph.D. 
candidate in the School of Forest Resources and Conservation, began working on the project in 2006 and plans to continue 
for the 2009-2010 year. 
“It’s important to keep mon-
ey in the program,” he said. 
Mark McLellan, dean of 
research for UF’s Institute of 
Food and Agricultural Scienc-es, said he likes the idea that students are getting involved in the research and said Peter and Kirst are among UF’s brightest researchers. 
“It’s up to the faculty to get 
students excited about science, and Kirst and Peter know how to do it,” he said.Students search

 Charlaine Harris, author of the 
“Southern Vampire Mysteries” 
book series is the keynote speaker of Gainesville Anhinga Writers’ Studio 2009 Summer Studio held 
this week at the Hilton Conference 
Center on 34th Street. 
Tonight, she will share tricks of 
her craft with aspiring novelists in 
Gainesville. 
Harris’ succesful book series 
centers on the trials of Sookie 
Stackhouse, a mind-reading wait-ress living in BonTemps, La., who has fallen in love with the local vampire. 
Harris’ novels craftily weave 
the real and the surreal and won her the Anthony Award for best paperback mystery in 2001.  The “Southern Vampire Mysteries” series is also the basis for HBO’s weekly drama, “True Blood,” star-ring Academy Award-winning ac-tress Anna Paquin. The show is in 
its second season. 
Harris, a New York Times best-
selling author, is currently work-
ing on the 10th book to the Sookie Stackhouse series — anticipated in 2010.
How do you relate to Sookie?Well, everyone I write about 
is a part of me, which in itself is a 
little scary.
Would you say you started the 
current vampire literary trend?
No, Laurell K. Hamilton was 
the start of the current wave of 
the vampire craze, and then I came right after her. It’s certainly a newly popular ﬁ  eld in writing. I feel ﬁ  ne to be a part of it, but I hope that when people move along to something else, that I’m still left standing.
How do you feel about HBO 
signing the ‘Southern Mysteries into the True Blood series? 
I knew when I signed the con-
tract with Alan that he would have to change the story somewhat be-cause it’s told from ﬁ  rst person point of view. And you can’t ﬁ  lm a television show like that, but 
he stays true to the spirit of the 
books.
Do you believe in vampires? I know there are people that 
think that they’re vampires, but I’ve never met a true vampire my-self.
Would you call the “Southern 
Vampire Mysteries” frightening? 
I certainly don’t see my books as 
frightening. Life is scary enough.
Where do you ﬁ  nd inspiration 
for your writing?
Inspiration isn’t a word that 
describes the writing process. If you’re a writer, that’s what you do — you think about things to write. If you wait for inspiration, you’re 
going to be sitting there and your 
contracts going to be gone and your editor will ﬁ  re you. 
What was the one point that 
you knew you were successful?
After the ﬁ  rst book, “Dead 
Until Dark,” had been out maybe three or four months, I had already signed a contract for two books. 
And they wanted to sign another contract for three more books be-
fore the second one had even been written.
How does your family react to 
you being a writer?
They’re used to it. They’re used 
to their mom not being like other moms. Now that I’m very success-ful, they ﬁ  nally think I’m cool.
What do you do in your free 
time?
I read. I read and I write. Writ-
ing books is a very solitary pro-cess, and the only way you can 
get it done is motivate yourself to 
do it. You have to be able to start yourself and keep on going with-out anybody standing over you. 
What do you plan to do in 
Gainesville?
I look forward to talking to 
people in a little more depth than I usually do. Talking about my 
longevity in the publishing indus-
try will help people when they’re faced with their own choices.
Do you have any advice for 
upcoming writers?
Every writer needs to read as 
much as they possibly can. You 
need to learn to separate the 
good writing from the bad, and 
you need to know why. It’s also important to always have some-
thing waiting in the wings that 
you want to do. Never just have 
just one project, because that just 
doesn’t work now. The event is 
open to the public, and tickets are 
available at the door for $25 literature

Farm to Family Full Moon Fes-
tival, a three-day outdoor music 
festival is being relocated. 
Don Appelbaum’s property, 
which previously hosted the event every full moon, can no longer sustain the event’s capac-
ity. 
Appelbaum, 62, had to call it 
quits this summer when he re-
ceived a formal request from his neighbors to discontinue the fes-
tival.
The noise brought on by hun-
dreds of partygoers and musi-
cians had become too much for 
his neighbors.  
He is opting to not fight the 
request, and he said it’s because 
this that he gets to keep his party going.
Alachua County officials also 
found Appelbaum lacks proper event permits to host live shows on his 40-acre property. By code, 
large gatherings must be sched-uled at least 60 days apart. The 
full moon, however, comes every 28 days.  But he said he is willing 
to comply with their demands.
“I just want to be a good 
neighbor,” Appelbaum said. 
“They moved out to the country 
for quiet.”
Appelbaum started the festi-
val in 2005, after his organic farm 
business begun to suffer. 
Although he still works in the 
farming industry, the music fes-tival also helps pay his mortage now. Tickets to the event run $15 to $20 per day or $40 for a week-
end pass. 
“Everybody likes to dance, but 
that requires louder music,” Ap-
pelbaum said.
He began by catering to mid-
dle-age bluegrass lovers like him-self, but in recent years, Appel-baum started bringing out newer, more popular Afro-rock, ska and 
jazz bands — The Duppies, Umo-ja Orchestra, De Lions of Jah.
Fans followed in huge masses, 
as the event has hosted up to 600 
people at some shows. He real-ized then the event was getting 
out of hand.
“It’s like a baby in the womb. 
At some point it has to come out,” 
Appelbaum said. “We either ex-pand or go away.”
Appelbaum is forced to search 
for larger, more welcoming ven-ues to host the growing festival each new moon.
He does not bemoan the fact 
that his festival will never be on his property again, and he doesn’t expect those who come to 
the shows to do so either.
“It was such a magical thing, 
but that magic isn’t confined to 
just one place. When the people 
come, the magic starts,” Appel-
baum said.
The stage for the bands to per-
form on is conveniently made from a converted produce trailer 
and pieces of an old greenhouse 
for the covering, so mobility is not an issue.
 In April, Appelbaum found 
a farm just a few miles up the road from his farm in Alachua in which to host the May event. 
Brian McElroy, owner of the 
210-acre McElroy farm expressed 
interest in hosting the event after 
the pair met at the April festival.
McElroy plans to host another 
Farm to Family Full Moon event 
on Oct. 3.
“On my end it was very stress 
free and a lot of fun,” McElroy 
said. “They’re real good people.”
Appelbaum has also located another venue in which to host 
the September festival, which 
will be held to kick off the Gator football season.
  On Sept. 4, 5 and 6, the Farm 
to Family Full Moon Gator Party will be at the Lions Club Music Park in High Springs. 
Appelbaum plans to televise 
the UF — Charleston Southern 
game on flat screens and have the 
biggest Gator Party anywhere.  
Fifteen bands will hit the stage 
on Saturday and Sunday, with a 
pre-party and drum clinic being 
held on Friday.
There is a tentative schedule of 
Full Moon Festivals to come after the Sept. 5 and Oct. 3 events, but 
he will have to keep scouting the 
location for subsequent festivals, he wants to host in late October, 
November and January. 
Appelbaum will keep Farm to 
Family goers posted as to the lo-
cation at www.farmtofamilymu-sic.com.Farm to Family Full Moon Festival booted off property

DON APPELBAUM
event coordinatorALEX ORLANDO  � AVENUE WRITERShe sits in the dressing room on 
her pink and brown striped bed. Her 
matching dish has the word “Diva” 
printed on it.
There is no sign of anxiety on her 
face. She has done this before.
Chula, the 7-pound, 8-inch-tall, tri-
colored Chihuahua, goes out on stage 
to perform her number. She is the reincarnation of Norma Desmond. Tilting her head back with the poise and pomp of the iconic 1950s fictional movie star, she appears in the arms of Kim Mead, her owner and an ac-tress performing in the Hippodrome State Theatre’s “The Great American Trailer Park Musical.”
There is a rule in theater: Don’t act 
with children or animals. They will upstage your performance. 
But Chula’s act alongside the sev-
en other talented human castmates creates a more hysterical and realistic aspect to the musical set in a modern-day trailer park, Armadillo Acres, in 
Starke.
The play, which is the Hippo-
drome’s most successful Mainstage 
performance in 36 years, has caused a 
commotion since opening day.
The first time the show ran in 2006, 
it sold nearly 22,000 tickets.
“The show is the best ever,” said 
Rocky Draud, general manager at the 
Hippodrome Theatre. “We are hop-ing it beats its own record. We want to sell 25,000 tickets or even 26,000.”
The box office has sold about 
13,500 tickets since the show opened in June. 
“I love it when something in town 
brings us all together to share a com-mon bond,” said the Hippodrome’s Artistic Director, Lauren Caldwell.Although the script does not in-
clude a dog, Caldwell told Mead that she could include Chula where she thought it could work.
Chula won over the crowd with 
her beady black eyes, but the glam-orous puppy starlet was not always 
destined for the mainstage.
Mead adopted Chula, who was 
badly abused at a puppy mill, three 
years ago after finding her on www.petfinder.org. 
 “When I first met her she was 
afraid of everything,” Mead said. 
“She hid from me under the chair. 
She didn’t want anything to do with me, but something was telling me to take her home.” 
It took several months before Chu-
la would become comfortable with her new lifestyle. While Mead helped 
rehabilitate her then 5.5-pound dog, 
she landed the role of Charlotta in the UF-produced “The Cherry Orchard.”
In the script, Charlotta had a dog, 
so she thought it would be funny to include Chula.
After her successful debut, Chula 
reappeared on stage in the Hippo-drome’s “College: The Musical,” directed by Caldwell, where by the end of the show’s run she would bark along to the song in her scene.
“She just seemed to fit in,” 
Caldwell said. 
Chula, meaning “cute” in Spanish, 
does not come short of her name.
“We’ve had oohs and aahs when 
that dog comes in with its Harley Da-vidson outfit,” Caldwell said. “People are dog lovers. Those that do come to the show always comment on the dog.”
As she charms her way to the au-
dience’s hearts, it is clear that Chula is in a happier place.
“She’s a one-woman dog,” 
Caldwell said of Mead and Chula’s bond. “They have a very interesting relationship.”
Despite her rough past, Chula has 
learned to come out of her shell and to love again.
“Rescue dogs are very special,” 
Mead said. “I had to be patient for her to love me, and that makes her more special.”
The show has been extended to

With the deaths of icons Michael Jackson, Farah Fawc-
ett, Ed McMahon and Billy Mays earlier this summer, it’s 
a wonder the baby boomer generation has anything to re-
late to anymore.
I’m sure everyone is tired of turning on the television to 
see Michael Jackson. Were there track marks on his arms? 
Was the body really buried with the casket? Was his nose 
really still attached to his body? Does anyone really care? Just listen to the hundreds of soon-to-come unreleased songs, dance in front of your mirror and cry about it.
Speaking of celebrity-related heartbreak, notice the 
sobbing of millions of tweens that rang out across subur-
ban America after Kevin Jonas announced his engage-
ment to Danielle Deleasia? And guess how his bandmate 
bros congratulated him: Twitter. Real sentimental, guys. Maybe Jonas and Deleasia will tweet out their wedding invitations in a few months.

Rupert Grint hinted at his undying love for Emma Wat-
son in an interview this month. After sucking face with her in the filming of their next movie, “Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hollows,” they both said, rather unconvincingly, that they have no attraction for each other and the kiss was awkward. Watson reportedly has a boyfriend, but he should be no match for the love potion Grint’s brewing. 
We’re all pulling for you, Rupert. You’ve got this.

Millions of nerds, dorks and geeks put on their finest 
spandex superhero outfits, hopped in mom’s minivan and 
headed to San Diego last week for Comic-Con 2009. There 
they got to check out action figures, learn to draw their favorite comics, read up on the latest manga and watch 
sneak previews for movies such as “Avatar” and “Jonah 
Hex,” which stars Megan Fox. 
Gaming nerds should also beware a potential addic-
tion to World of Warcraft. This online multiplayer role- 
playing game is more addicting than crack. Just ask the kid who has more than 6 million views on YouTube and was featured on Fox News for a video of his meltdown after his mom canceled his online account. His tantrum included, but was not limited to, screaming, kicking, re-
moval of clothing  and attempted sodomy with a televi-
sion remote.

POLL QUESTION FOOTBALL AWARDS SWIMMING NEWSBy ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
While the Northeastern US is home to 
the most avid lacrosse following, UF is 
hoping it can bring some of that passion down south as Gainesville will soon be home to one of the sport’s finest facilities. 
The new home of the UF women’s la-
crosse team, scheduled to be completed Saturday, is shaping up to be one of the best college lacrosse stadiums in the coun-try.
Some of the aspects that help set this 
stadium apart include the fact that it will be used only for the lacrosse team, and the team will have its own locker room, train-
ing room and equipment room.
“It’s the No. 1 lacrosse facility in the 
country,” UF women’s lacrosse coach 
Amanda O’Leary said. “We have the abil-ity to bring in recruits and wow them. The 
facility is just completely self-sufficient.”
It will be located directly across from 
the Southwest Recreation Center and will 
feature three fields. One will be used for 
lacrosse games, and the second is a prac-
tice field for the team. The final field will be used as a practice field for the UF soccer team.
When it came down to picking a loca-
tion for the facility, there weren’t many choices.
“It was the only land on campus that 
was planned long-term for recreational sports or athletics,” said University Ath-letic Association Associate Director of Op-
erations Bryan Flood.
About 155 parking spaces have been 
added on the north end of the site to allevi-
ate some of the parking trouble caused by the softball stadium and Southwest Rec.
According to the UAA, the entire proj-
ect is costing about $15 million, and it is being financed solely by private funds raised by the UAA and Gators boosters.
O’Leary, who came to UF after 14 sea-
sons at Yale, had to share the women’s lacrosse stadium with the men’s lacrosse and soccer teams at her former job. But in Gainesville, she is getting the op-
portunity to begin the program’s inaugu-ral season in her own facility.
“They have exceeded all of my expecta-
tions,” she said. “They give you everything you need to be successful here, where at 
other schools you are sort of scratching for 
funds.”
The first game is set for Feb. 20, 2010, 
as the Gators will send out 24 freshmen to 
face Jacksonville. But O’Leary will not let 
the young roster be an excuse for a subpar season.
“The precedent has been set within the sports. It’s just high-quality athletics 
here,” she said. “We are just going to go 
out and do our best to represent and keep that bar rising.”
After being hired on June 22, 2007, it 
has been a long process for O’Leary to get 
to this point. But now that the first game is 
rapidly approaching, she looks back fond-ly on  the development of the program.
“You can’t even put into words every-
thing that has gone into the process that has led to this point,” she said. “I don’t have a word to describe it. I’m just sort of at a loss for words.”

UF’s new lacrosse complex, located across from the Southwest Recreation Center, will feature three fields: one for lacrosse games, 
one for lacrosse practices and another the UF soccer team will use for practice. Lacrosse’s season opener will be Feb. 20, 2010.
$15 million lacrosse facility nears completion
The men’s basketball team’s season is already off to a 
better start than last year.
The Gators don’t open their season until a Nov. 2 
exhibition game against Saint Leo, but the non-conference schedule released earlier this week is an encouraging sign of coach Billy Donovan’s commitment to turning the program around.
UF will play national runner-up Michigan State at the 
end of November in Atlantic City, N.J., where it will also face either Rutgers or UMass in the conclusion of the Leg-end’s Classic. 
Last year, the Gators played in an early season tourna-
ment against Washington and Syracuse, beating the former and losing to the latter. Had UF not collapsed down the stretch, the victory against Washing-ton would have been one of the team’s 
strongest justifications for making the 
NCAA Tournament.
Playing quality out-of-conference 
opponents in the fall has no downside for the Gators. 
Win, and they have a respectable 
line on their NCAA Tournament re-sumé. 
Lose, and they strengthen their 
team with a defeat that won’t hurt them as bad as a poor strength of schedule would. 
If I were Donovan, I’d rather see my team lose to UMass than watch it trample Florida Gulf Coast. 
And if the schedule is any indication, Donovan and I 
view this subject the same way.
“This is as challenging a non-conference schedule as I can 
remember us having,” Donovan said in a statement. “This schedule will definitely challenge us and prepare us for our conference season.”
And the Gators’ schedule will only get more challenging 
when they take on Syracuse in the SEC/Big East Challenge in Tampa on Dec. 10. 
UF will also host FSU, which has won the matchup the 
last three years, and face another ACC opponent on the road Tougher non-conference schedule first step in the right direction

 Last year at this time, all the talk around 
the UF football program was about the de-
fense.
It wasn’t good.
It was along the lines of whether or not 
the Gators could stop opponents enough 
to allow their high-octane offense to win 
games.  
Much has changed in a year’s time.
UF’s defense, aided by a 
surprisingly good second-
ary, was just as spectacular 
as its offense in 2008. The Gators allowed only 12.9 points per game, fourth in 
the nation.
UF had 26 interceptions in 2008, put-
ting it in a tie among the nation’s best. This 
included 14 interceptions in six games against top-25 teams.
And the Gators return their entire two-
deep on defense for the 2009 season.
So now the question becomes: Will UF’s 
defense this season rank among the best 
ever?
It sounds absurd until you remember 
2009 is shaping up to be like 2008 with ev-
eryone a year older.
The Gators allowed only 58 ﬁ  rst-half points in 14 games against a schedule that ranked second-toughest in the country, ac-cording to the NCAA.
The unit helped contribute to a school-
record plus-22 turnover margin, second in 
the country.
And the defense saved its best for last in the BCS National Championship Game 
against Oklahoma.
The Sooners entered the Jan. 8 show-
down with an offense many called the best of all time. They had scored a ridiculous 
702 points in their ﬁ  rst 13 game (which 
breaks down to an incredible 54 per game) and had averaged 562 yards of total of-fense.
UF’s defense allowed 14 points and 363 
yards in Dolphin Stadium.
That’s not to say the Gators don’t have 
areas where they can improve. There were still stretches last season where UF would fall back into its bend-but-don’t-break mold, allowing teams to work their 
way down the ﬁ  eld before cracking down 
inside the red zone to get a key stop or momentum-changing interception. The unit ﬁ  nished third nationally in red zone defense.
The Gators also ranked only 15th in 
rushing defense (105.4 yards/game) and 20th in passing defense (179.86 yards/game), although it should be noted that 
in total defense (285.3 yards/game), they 
were No. 9 in the nation, a testament to how difﬁ  cult it can be to successfully de-fend through the air and on the ground.
But there’s a reason former UF beat 
reporter and current SI.com writer Andy Staples wrote in April that UF’s backups could likely form their own team and be in the top 25.
Looking at the reserves on this Gators 
defense, he was probably only half joking.
And that’s why all signs point to the fact 
that the question will likely be how, not if, the 2009 UF defense stacks up against the 
best ever. 
(North Carolina State).
Possibly the most interesting bit 
of scheduling is the Feb. 13 game 
against Xavier. It will mark the Gators’ ﬁ  rst non-conference game during league play since 2003, and it will come against a team that 
went 27-8 last season.After missing the NCAA Tour-
nament for the second straight 
year, the out-of-conference slate 
is a step in the right direction for 
Donovan and his team. It’s not a sign that the program is back to its glory days by any means, but it displays a new way of thinking UF 
has needed in the post-’04s era.
With an inexperienced team 
and an unknown level of talent the last two years, Donovan was likely 
afraid to throw his team into the ﬁ  re before the conference season 
began. 
But why shy away from real 
competition to keep his players’ 
conﬁ  dence high early in the sea-son if it didn’t pay off when it 
mattered? Isn’t it better for them 
to learn their mistakes and know their weaknesses before SEC play kicks off?
Of course it is. The Gators were 
13-2 with one meaningful victory 
(Washington) before conference 
season last year and ﬁ  nished 9-7 against a mediocre-at-best SEC. 
Even if the Gators lose every sin-
gle one of their matchups against 
competitive teams, they will be 
better prepared to work their way through the SEC. Not to say they’ll waltz on by Kentucky or anything, but at least the Wildcats won’t be the ﬁ  rst top-25 team UF sees.
The Gators may not make it 
back to the NCAA Tournament with this schedule, but who’s to say they would do so by playing easy in-state games? Even if Dono-
van’s team loses the tough games, 
his team will be better off for hav-ing played them.

How will UF compensate for the loss of Harvin’s playmaking ability?Top 10 Burning Questions for 2009-10
 By ADAM BERRY 
 Alligator Staff Writer 
 sports@alligator.org 
  
 Percy Harvin was a one-of-a-kind 
player during his college career.
Whether coming out of the backﬁ  eld 
or stretching the ﬁ  eld as a receiver, Har-
vin was an electrifying playmaker and good for a touchdown per game. 
With Harvin sporting the Minnesota 
Vikings’ purple and white instead of or-ange and blue this fall, UF must answer one of the only questions facing the of-fense this year: How will the Gators re-
place Harvin?
While no single player 
has shown the skill set Harvin possessed, UF 
has plenty of options to 
attempt to ﬁ  ll his produc-
tion by committee. At running back, Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey will likely see expanded roles after last year, and fresh-
man wideout Andre Debose will join 
returning receivers Deonte Thompson, David Nelson and Carl Moore.
Demps and Rainey averaged an iden-
tical 7.8 yards per carry in 2008 while rushing for more than 600 yards each. Much like Harvin, the two running backs share a quick running style and the ability to break open a play.
Despite playing in only 12 of 14 games 
in 2008 and getting fewer carries than ei-ther Demps or Rainey, Harvin ﬁ  nished the year ﬁ  rst on the team in yards per carry (9.4) and second in rushing yards 
(660) and touchdowns (10) — Tim Tebow 
ﬁ  nished on top in both.
Harvin’s numbers were outstanding, 
but his greatest strength was how difﬁ  cult he made defensive coordinators’ prepara-
tions each week. As dangerous as he was 
out of the backﬁ  eld, he was just as much of a threat lined up as a receiver.
Unless Demps or Rainey develops that 
sort of versatility, the largely unproven group of receivers will be charged with compensating for the loss of Harvin and the graduated Louis Murphy. 
Debose has been hyped as having the 
requisite skills to replace Harvin, but as a freshman those expectations may be un-fairly high. In addition, he and the receiv-ing corps will ﬁ  rst have to prove them-
selves before even being considered as 
Harvin’s heir apparents.
The Gators have the talent at both posi-
tions to at least replace Harvin’s numbers, but the real issue will be replacing Har-
vin’s versatility and playmaking ability.

 UF running back Jeff Demps will play a big role in attempting to replace Percy Harvin’s 
production out of the backﬁ  eld. Chris Rainey and the receiving corps will also be key.
