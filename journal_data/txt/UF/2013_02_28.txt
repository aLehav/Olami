Karla Flagg grinned as she stepped 
into the Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts on Wednesday night, admiring the ticket she clutched in her hands.
Flagg, a 21-year-old Palatka resident, 
came to listen to someone she admires.
“I’m excited to be here seeing Maya 
Angelou,” she said.
The acclaimed poet and author vis-
ited UF and spoke to about 1,600 peo-ple inside the auditorium at the Accent Speakers’ Bureau-sponsored event.
About 650 more people gathered 
around a large screen that broadcasted the speech outside.
Angelou talked for an hour, telling 
stories about her life. Sometimes she broke into song or into different ac-cents.
She quoted her own poems and the 
works of others such as William Shake-speare and Edgar Allen Poe. Angelou said she experienced the strengthening inﬂ  uence of poetry as a child. After she was raped at age 7 by her mother’s boy-friend, she said, she told adults what had happened. Soon after, she heard a mob had kicked him to death. She didn’t speak for six years because she thought her words could kill people. Reading po-etry during that time helped her expe-rience the healing power of words, she said.
Angelou urged the audience to mem-
orize poetry for a strong foundation.
“When you ﬁ  nd the grades are not 
what you hoped they’d be — when your beloved has found another beloved — you need something to call upon,” she said.
Paris Wheeler, a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology and criminology junior, said Angelou’s presentation conveyed emo-tion that made the words she read come alive.
“I used to love poetry,” she said. 
“And she really reinstated that for me tonight.”

Research paid for by taxpayers will 
soon be open to the public, according to 
a memorandum released by the White House Friday.
The memo told federal agencies that 
give more than $100 million in research funds a year to submit plans to openly release the research within a year of its peer-reviewed journal release.
The government already requires re-
search funded by the National Institutes of Health to be published on PubMed.gov, said David Norton, UF’s vice presi-dent for research. The new directive mir-rors this process for all taxpayer-funded research.
Norton said the initiative will affect 
UF research, which received $423 million in government funds in 2012, but nobody knows what the new plans will require.
UF Scholarly Communications Librar-
ian Christine Fruin said open access leg-islation has been an issue for years, but bills usually don’t get far. Fruin said the fear now is that unless such a bill passes, the next administration could reverse the president’s directive.
Traditionally, papers are submitted 
to journals for peer review and then re-leased to the public for a subscription fee 
or on open access sites.
“It’s just counter-
intuitive to lock up re-
search paid for by tax-payers behind journal paywalls,” she said.
UF pays for access 
to multiple journals a year, Fruin said. Once students are unafﬁ  li-
ated with the university, their free access is cut off.
Director of the Florida Program for 
Shark Research George Burgess said he has no problem opening research to the public and other scientists after it’s been through the traditional peer-review pub-lication process. However, he fears open research could be misinterpreted or used for data theft, or it could cause issues with medical conﬁ  dentiality . All research to be publishedRyan Jones / Alligator Staff

File sharers beware: A new program 
launched Monday is set to offer some visible 
consequences for illegally downloading mu-sic, ﬁ  lms and TV shows online.
Five Internet service provider titans, Ve-
rizon, AT&T, Comcast, Cablevision and Time Warner have collaborated with the Center for Copyright Information to create the Copyright Alert System.
UF’s wireless Internet doesn’t come from 
these providers, so the new alert system won’t apply to students using Internet on campus.
However, students living off-campus 
whose Internet is provided by Comcast can be directly affected.
Christine Fruin, an attorney who leads 
copyright workshops for graduate students in Library West, said the system was devised in response to the recent failure of government legislation to reduce online piracy.
“Because it didn’t look like any kind of gov-ernmental control was going to be a reality,” Fruin said, “some copyright holders basically entered into negotiations with several internet service providers to create this program.” 
A CCI spokeswoman said the system was 
originally scheduled to debut in late Novem-ber but had to be pushed back because of tech-nological difﬁ  culties.
Here’s how the program works: CCI con-
tracted Markmonitor, an anti-piracy compa-ny, to search through torrenting websites for movies, TV shows and albums being shared. When the program ﬁ  nds the ﬁ  les, it sends the information to ISPs, which then identiﬁ  es the customers suspected in sharing the ﬁ  les.
As of Wednesday evening, no ISP had re-
leased an individual plan for how they will deal with copyright infringers.
However, the CCI has released a basic over-
view of the alert system.Popular Internet providers use

For the first couple of offenses, emails are 
sent to users about their alleged pirating, Fruin 
said. If pirating continues, users will then be redirected to a website where they must read a document or watch a video about copyright infringement. 
In the final phase, ISPs may slow down 
customers’ downloading speeds for a specific period of time, Fruin said.
“They’re basically progressively more an-
noying ways of trying to educate you or put you on notice that ‘hey , you’re involved in this copyright infringement,’” she said.
Customers can challenge alerts through the American Arbitration Association for $35, which is refunded if warnings are overturned, according to the CCI website.
Fruin said as part of the program, ISPs can’t 
share their customer’s personal information unless required by law.
“Men in black suits aren’t going to show up 
to your door to arrest you,” she said. “It’s re-ally more framed as an educational program.”
For students like Kelsea Lebeau, a 20-year-
old UF health science sophomore, the idea of the program is enough to get her to start pay-ing for music.
“I might not necessarily like it, but it’s 
smart,” she said. “I would rather have Internet than illegally downloaded music.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2013

The U.S. Department of Edu-
cation’s College Affordability 
and Transparency Center has created College Scorecard, rec-ognizing UF with top marks.
Promoting students to pur -
sue higher education, College Scorecard was created to make it easier for students to find a college that fits their needs. It allows future students to search by factors like region, major and environment.
The scorecard lets students 
see how expensive the school is, how many students pay off their loans and what kind of jobs stu-dents land after graduation.
UF was recognized by the 
White House with having com-paratively low costs at $11,579 a year, a high, 83.7 percent grada-tion rate and a low median bor -
rowing of $161.11 per month. UF was also recognized as having a low, 3 percent student loan de-fault rate.
UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the scorecard verifies what the university has said for years.
“The University of Florida 
is of incredible value,” she said. “We have very bright students, 90 percent of whom receive some sort of Bright Futures or other scholarships. They get a fabulous education, and they leave for great careers with far less debt than their student peers in other states.”
V eronica Mingrone, an 
18-year-old UF public relations freshman, said she was happy to hear about UF’s high standing.
“It makes me feel like I made 
the right choice in coming here,” she said. ”I think it’s pretty great to go to a university acknowl-edged for its excellence.”

Recipes can change with additional ingredients 
or improvised measurements.
But for Luke Kemper, owner and brewer at 
Swamp Head Brewery, making beer is a delicate 
process with little room for errors.
Kemper’s work as a local brewer, however, has 
landed him a spot in the March 2013 issue of All About Beer Magazine, a national beer publica-tion.
The magazine featured about 30 brewers young-
er than 30 years old from around the country.
Kemper, 30, bought his first brewing equipment 
in 2008. After about two years experimenting with converting home-brewed recipes, he sold his first batch of beer.
Since the issue hit stands earlier this month, 
Kemper said he has received a lot of feedback from friends, co-workers and family.
“The craft community, it’s growing,” he said, 
“and it’s a very supportive community.”
Brandon Nappy, marketing manager at Swamp 
Head, said he was excited to see Kemper and his work featured in the magazine.
“You don’t see a lot of younger people, espe-
cially under the age of 30, jumping into a business of this caliber and doing well at it,” Nappy said.
Of the 30 people featured, Kemper was the only 
brewer who was also an owner, Nappy said.
“The industry is taking off,” Kemper said. 
“People are excited about it. I was just excited to be a part of it.”THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A New Jersey woman, who 
traveled about 1,000 miles sev-
eral times to have sex with a 16-year-old boy in Gainesville, was arrested last week in her hometown.
Officers from the Carteret 
Police Department arrested Lisa Silva, 33, on unlawful sexual activity with a minor and traveling to meet a minor for unlawful sexual conduct charges, said GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
The relationship started in 
July 2011 when Silva and the boy met on a Facebook game called YoVille, Tobias said.
Silva and the boy continued 
to talk to each other via phone calls, text messages, emails, let-ters and three in-person meet-ings.
Silva traveled to Gainesville 
twice to have sex with the boy, once in December 2011 and again in February 2012, Tobias said.
Gainesville Police started 
its investigation along with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice and the FBI after one of the boy’s family members tipped off the department about the relationship, Tobias said.
Investigators issued a sworn 
complaint affidavit to the State Attorney’s Office against Silva Dec. 12, Tobias said. On Feb. 7, the SAO issued a capias war -
rant for Silva’s arrest.
At about 11 p.m. Feb. 18, 
Carteret Police arrested Silva during a traffic stop and booked her into the Middlesex County Adult Corrections facility Feb. 19 on a $100,000 bond.
Silva was released Monday 
after she met bail.

Children and parents in rural areas have 
the opportunity to take part in a new program 
called Healthy Kids.
Healthy Kids, which educates and exam-
ines healthy lifestyle changes, is run by UF, Shands at UF, UF’s Institute of Food and Ag-ricultural Science and local UF/IFAS county extension offices.The free four-month program is supported 
by a grant from the National Institute of Dia-betes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The 12-session program consists of a team of doc-tors and psychologists who will meet with families, said Crystal S. Lim, a co-director of Healthy Kids.
Starting in May , the program will be offered 
in Flagler, Putnam and Suwannee counties.
Lim said one problem rural areas face is a 
lack of access to medical care, including pre-ventative care. Healthy Kids is the first pro-gram of its kind providing specific aid to chil-dren ages 3 to 7 in these areas.
“Recent research has come out that shows 
adults and children from rural areas are at an increased risk of being overweight and obese as well as having negative health conditions,” Lim said.The goal of Healthy Kids is to take informa-
tion learned through UF research and provide it to rural communities through the UF/IFAS extension offices, Lim said.
She also said parents are the primary tar -
gets of change.
“Parents have more control of the environ-
ment that kids are exposed to,” Lim said.
Virginia Horan, a 19-year-old UF biol-
ogy sophomore and a Shands volunteer, said she would love to work with a program like Healthy Kids.
“Helping kids when they’re younger to try 
and help fight obesity is the best way to help them try and do it in the future,” she said. UF programs collaborate to keep rural children healthy

70 TOTAL VOTESMorrissey defends vegetarian stereotype
On Tuesday night, the bearded, bandana-wearing, ca-
mo-clad cast of A&E’s runaway hit show “Duck Dy-nasty” walked onto the set of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 
and sat across from the host. After some calculated back-and-forth about the Robertson family’s newfound fame, Kimmel asked the question audiences were waiting to hear.
Days earlier, Morrissey, who was slated to appear on 
Tuesday night’s show, threatened to cancel unless the “Duck Dynasty” cast’s interview was changed to another night. Kimmel producers refused, and a different band replaced Morrissey.
“As far as my reputation is concerned,” Morrissey said in 
a statement, “I can’t take the risk of being on a show along-side people who, in effect, amount to animal serial killers.”
Kimmel asked the Robertson family patriarchs what they 
thought of the sudden public cancellation.
“When somebody told me about this,” said the famously 
loopy Uncle Si, “I was like, ‘Oh, you mean the lead singer of The Doors?’ They said, ‘No, you idiot!’”
“We don’t hold it against him at all,” Phil said. The other men agreed and, in so many words, said they 
don’t give a ﬂ  ip about food politics.
The Robertson men, whose cartoonish and backwoods 
lifestyle is A&E’s bread and butter, were perfectly gracious about Morrissey’s diva antics. Morrissey’s behavior isn’t sur-prising — his back-and-forth with the Staples Center regard-ing his request for the venue to be meat-free has served as a free publicity platform for his 2013 tour.
I hate to speak on behalf of vegetarians, but does anyone 
actually consider Morrissey an animal rights icon?
Does anyone ﬁ  nd this behavior noble or reactionary?No? Me neither.Although Morrissey’s attitude was one of a child throw-
ing a tantrum, the Robertsons’ reaction was surprisingly poised.
Furthermore, Morrissey’s holier-than-thou response 
seems to be less of an animal-rights battle and more of an attention-seeking low blow.
To call Morrissey’s “statement” animal rights activism would be grossly exaggerating what it actually was: a press move and a petty pride issue.
“Duck Dynasty,” while admit-
tedly hilarious and honest, is also hokey in a “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” way . Although “Duck Dynasty” may not be quite as po-larizing as “Honey Boo Boo,” its image is one of self-professed “red-
necks” living off the land in backwoods Louisiana.
The patriarch of the group and founder of the duck-call-
making company, Phil, makes fun of his sons for converting to “yuppism.” Although the family is quite wealthy — Willie Robertson’s net worth is upward of $10 million, according to www.therichest.org — it maintains an unwashed, uncouth, uncultured look for the sake of entertainment.
Is Morrissey really losing sleep at night because one fam-
ily in Louisiana produces duck calls and hunts wild turkey?
Is he really eager to provide his concertgoers with a meat-
free venue? Probably not. After all, the intentions of anyone with such an active involvement with PETA, a total farce of an organization, are questionable.
In 2012, PETA euthanized about 94 percent of cats and 
about 82 percent of dogs taken into its headquarters in Vir-ginia, according to a Hufﬁ  ngton Post article.
They run ad campaigns with similar sexual objectiﬁ  cation 
strategies as www.GoDaddy.com and Carl’s Jr., placing fe-male celebrities in submissive positions, like the controver-sial photo of Pamela Anderson posing in a bikini with parts of her body labeled “breasts,” “rump” and “round.”
Morrissey is not taking a stand against animal abuse.He’s not doing anything to prevent hunting or meat con-
sumption. Rather, he handed publicity to the Robertsons and is only causing the Staples Center to be meat-free for one night. He is nothing but a PETA pawn.

A great joke for a 
terrible partnership
The only time we feel jealous is when someone comes up 
with a hilarious pun before we get the chance to. It hap-pened to us this week, though, at Florida Atlantic Univer-
sity.
“The public university announced last week that it had struck 
a deal to name its football stadium after GEO Group Inc., one of the largest operators of for-proﬁ  t prisons in the U.S. and a major donor to the Florida Republican Party,” according to the Huff-ington Post. “In exchange, FAU will receive $6 million from the company over 12 years.”
“The $6 million donation over 12 years would grant naming 
rights of the stadium to the GEO Group, who have had charges ﬁ  led against them for several human rights violations, including sexual misconduct in their youth detention facilities and illegal drug smuggling,” according to University Press, FAU’s campus newspaper.
At the Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility, a GEO 
Group property in Mississippi, a report issued by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice found that the institu-tion was “deliberately indifferent to staff sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior with youth. The sexual misconduct we found was among the worst that we have seen in any facility anywhere in the nation,” according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post.
“I don’t know all the answers, I don’t know everything about 
this company. I do know that there are some things that have been discussed that may not be true,” President Mary Jane Saun-ders said in a statement that prompted one student to ask if she was being serious, according to SB Nation.
About 50 students staged a sit-in by the president’s ofﬁ  ce this 
week to protest the school’s decision.
“Saunders ultimately granted the protesters’ demand for a 
town-hall-style discussion of the ﬁ  asco, to be held Friday — at high noon — in the football stadium’s recruiting room, ironical-ly,” according to a Broward Palm Beach New Times blog post.
Look at them, getting things done the democratic way. Is 
there any way a group of students can go against such a large price tag during “tough economic times”?
“The board of trustees should have done due diligence on 
GEO before they signed that agreement,” Gonzalo Vizcardo, the leader of the student protest group called Stop Owlcatraz, told The Palm Beach Post.
That’s right. The Stop Owlcatraz Coalition. How perfect is 
that pun? We’re jealous. 
We’re not jealous of the fact that a for-proﬁ  t prison compa-
ny is about to own major property on another college campus. We’re not jealous that a company that has tolerated, to any de-gree, the mistreatment of youth within some of their detention centers has such a high amount of expendable cash to throw $6 million at a public university.
We don’t care what charities the GEO Group donates to. We 
don’t want them to come anywhere near our deﬁ  nitely presti-gious institution. 
Do you think FAU will just give back the $6 million grant? 
Probably not. What a great pun.

Spring Break is here, which means beach, booze and babes. You’re probably ready 
to live it up and forget the troubles of the semester. But do you have anywhere to go?
It’s hard to come up with great getaway ideas at the last minute, especially when 
most places in the region feature similar activities. Instead of looking for new things to 
do, look for new places to see. Amazing memories can come from spontaneous trips to the unknown.
1. Road tripGather a group of friends who live along the same route, and take a road trip stop-
ping at each of their hometowns. It’s a fun way to see how crazy friends alter their behaviors under parental supervision. Also, you get free housing and food for a couple of days and pay each other back as you go along. The only expense is gas. (A well-mannered guest also leaves a little something for hosts.)
2. Day trip to the BahamasA 24-hour excursion can be simpler and more economically sensi-
ble than a week’s vacation. Balearia Bahamas Express takes its guests 
round-trip from South Florida to Grand Bahama Island for $145. The travel time is 2 1/2 hours, but once you arrive, you can go horseback riding on the beach, shop, try lo-cal foods and drinks, and soak up the Caribbean sun.
3. Rent a house in Seaside, Fla.This town is full of unique Hampton’s-style rental homes starting at $150 a night. It’s 
perfect for the chic, laid-back types. Take some yoga and fitness classes at The Studio, and chow down on some cuisine in one of the many beachside restaurants during the day . At night, sip some wine, light a bonfire and relax by the beach with a group of close friends.
4. Blow some money in MiamiHit the beach, lounge poolside and socialize with drinks as the sun sets. Catch a 
performance by Travie McCoy March 1 and Naughty by Nature March 6 at LIV . Erick Morillo will be at Story March 8, and Sidney Samson will be at Mansion March 9th. All clubs charge between $30 and $60 for cover.
5. Stay close in St. AugustineGet a sense of history by visiting antique sites like the oldest school, the oldest house, 
America’s first church, the Castillo de San Marco, and the Fountain of Youth. All of this can be done on foot, and most landmarks charge less than $10 admission. If history isn’t your thing, lie out by the residential beach, where it’s almost always deserted.Spring Break trips on the flyALYSSA HOLCOMB

The Academy Awards. The 
Oscars. The biggest, longest, most 
glamorous night in motion pictures. This was a varied year in cinema, and the industry’s most celebrated evening had no shortage of stars and surprises.
Host Seth MacFarlane was not as 
raunchy as many predicted, instead opting for American history jokes (On Lincoln’s death: “It’s been 150 years, and it’s still too soon?”) and honing in on his musical ability.
His show-stopping opening number channeled previous host and 2013 nominee Hugh Jackman’s 2009 introduction but did not reach the same epic level.
There were some great cameos, 
from a dancing duet of Channing Tatum and Charlize Theron to a tap-dancing number with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Daniel Radc-liffe. The performance was good, but not Hugh Jackman good. Then again, there’s not much that can be Hugh Jackman good.
Continuing with the show’s per -
formance-heavy focus, the night also included a special movie musi-cal tribute with performances from “Chicago,” “Dreamgirls” and “Les Miserables.” In tweets and Tumblr posts, many wrote the Oscars were 
turning into the Tony Awards 
— but no com-plaints here.
Beloved di-
vas Adele and Barbra Streisand performing “Sky-fall” and “The Way We Were,” 
respectively, added to the night’s theme of music in film.
The night was orchestrated by 
classic movie themes, from Harry Potter’s “Hedwig’s Theme” to transition to and from commer -
cial breaks, to the title track from “Jaws” used as a hilarious cut-off for long acceptance speeches.
Golden statues for Best Support-
ing Actress and Actor went to Anne Hathaway for “Les Miserables” and Christoph Waltz in “Django Unchained,” respectively. In light of Ben Affleck’s “Argo” snub, Ang Lee took the Best Director trophy for “Life Of Pi.”
Best Actress and Best Actor 
went to Jennifer Lawrence for “Sil-ver Linings Playbook” and Daniel Day-Lewis for “Lincoln,” respec-tively.
“Argo” took home the night’s 
top honor of Best Picture, courtesy of a satellite telecast from first lady Michelle Obama and in-person Jack Nicholson.
Endless jokes about the show’s 
nearly four-hour time slot aside, this year’s ceremony was just what the Oscars should be: a combina-tion of artistic (sometimes over -
hyped) cinematic excellence, the stars who made them shine both on and off the screen, and the oc-casional slip up the stairs. (It’s OK, Jennifer Lawrence. You’re an Oscar winner now.)
Trophy Hunting: The Oscars wrap up awards season for film

Christopher Gonzalez has seen people 
get thrown to the ground, slammed into and 
punched in the face.
“It’s somewhere between a fight, a riot 
and a party,” Gonzalez, a 19-year-old UF English sophomore, said. “A frantic, chaotic mess of insane smiles, whirling fists and feet, and a few good open-handed shoves.”
He’s not describing a riot. He’s describ-
ing a mosh pit, and some have it down to a science. Jesse Silverberg, a doctoral student at Cornell University, conducted a study on the topic.
Silverberg’s findings suggest moshing 
isn’t random acts of violence but, instead, a universal pattern. Participants in mosh pits behave like gas particles bouncing around in the air in unpredictable ways.
Jason Cain, a lecturer for UF’s Rock ‘n’ 
Roll and American Society class, said the study is believable. 
“There is a precedent for things that we 
think are chaotic to sometimes have a pattern that we see over and over again,” he said.
Cain described moshing as controlled 
violence and a feeling of being out of control without actually being out of control.
Rob Paradise, a 23-year-old guitarist for 
the Gainesville punk band Heart Prevails, said it has a lot to do with escapism.
“Going to shows is a way for people to 
break up their daily routines and forget about their problems for awhile,” he said. “Moshing really helps immerse you in the experience.”
Moshing is about connecting with people, 
Paradise said, and not just pushing them around.
“While there is certainly an aggressive ele-
ment to moshing, it isn’t supposed to be just unrestrained violence,” he said.
Imani Harris, a 21-year-old UF family, 
youth and community sciences junior, said she has suffered from a concussion and a bloody nose from being knocked and kicked around inside a pit.
And yet, a pit etiquette does exist.Paradise, Gonzalez and Cain agree mosh 
pits usually have some order to help up the fallen and keep the “rules” of the pit.
In the study, Silverberg said, mosh pits 
could help professionals research what emer -
gency situations are like by studying the ac-tions inside of the pits themselves.
Cain said that during the massive pit at 
Rage Against the Machine at Lollapalooza in 1996, there were two people who helped  keep the pit in order, similar to an emergency situation.
Whether mosh pits are scientific in nature, 
or are a glimpse into emergency situations remains uncertain. It is certain, however, that they allow people to escape.
“When people are in the pit, they’re just 
in a different world where nothing else mat-ters,” Harris said. “They can just let loose and really connect with the music.”Open this pit up: mosh science
“When people are in the pit, 
they’re just in a different world 
where nothing else matters. They 
can just let loose and really connect 
with the music.”

Dear Friend,

nudie-pic senders. The end.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What’s the deal with Snapchat? I 
just don’t get it.
Dear Friend,
I believe you are talking about scooping because none of that 
sounds remotely satisfying. Scooping is when you randomly scoop someone’s boob while saying “scoop.” This is only OK for girls to do to each other, unless there is a guy out there who desperately wants to get kicked in the nuts. When dealing with a woman’s breasts, try to be sensual, passionate and pleasurable. Although I’m pretty sure you were raised  in a cave, please avoid anything 
you might deem “terrifyingly spontaneous.”Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been described as being “too ferocious” when I 
grab my partner’s breasts. How can I make sure my grabbing is satisfying for my partner but remains ter-
rifyingly spontaneous?
Dear Friend,

What should I do?Dear Mediocre Advice,
My friends think I’m boring be-cause I’d rather sit in my apart-ment than be miserable in public at a bar. How do you avoid having a

Dear Friend,
Lower your expectations, plan in ad-
vance and have a back-up plan. If all of that fails, look on the bright side: You can go home and do what you really wanted to do — catch up on the Netflix 
show “House of Cards” and drink beer.This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international studies. Would

When Tennessee guard 
Trae Golden dished the ball to 
Jarnell Stokes on the low block with 8:16 left in the first half, forwards Erik Murphy and DeVon Walker double-teamed the 6-foot-8, 270-pound center. 
Stokes missed his first 
layup but pulled down the re-bound after Walker mistimed his jump.
The Volunteers forward’s 
second field goal attempt — a left-handed hook shot — was short, but he snatched the ball out of the 6-foot-6, 191-pound Walker’s hands for another of-fensive rebound. 
As Walker backed off and 
Murphy watched, Stokes made the bucket on his third try. 
The play was indicative of 
how dominant UT was on the glass Tuesday night. 
Tennessee outrebounded 
No. 8 Florida 41-31 and tal-lied 13 offensive boards, hand-ing the Gators a 64-58 loss in Knoxville, Tenn.  
Stokes led the Volunteers 
with 14 rebounds, including six offensive boards.
The sophomore big man 
also chipped in eight points in 24 minutes.
“We had a couple times 
where we had guys around him, but obviously, he’s a big, strong guy,” Florida coach Bil-ly Donovan said. “When you have that kind of body, when the ball gets in his hands, he grabs it. That’s his greatest strength.”
Tennessee coach Cuonzo 
Martin added: “[Stokes has] made that commitment to get big rebounds. … He takes pride 
in rebounding, and that’s why 
you see the results.” 
Florida’s frontcourt strug-
gled to rebound without two of its most efficient players.  
Forward Will Yeguete 
missed his sixth game since undergoing arthroscopic sur -
gery on Feb. 8 to remove bone chips in his right knee. Mi-chael Frazier II, the Gators’ best rebounding guard, sat out Tuesday night’s contest with a concussion. 
Murphy grabbed six re-
bounds, center Patric Young recorded five and forward Casey Prather notched only two.  
Point guard Scottie Wil-
bekin led UF with eight re-bounds. 
UT guard Jordan McRae, 
who scored a game-high 27 points, pulled down seven boards.
The Volunteers out-
rebounded the Gators 24-14 in the second half.
Stokes’ most important 
offensive board came in the game’s final minute. 
With Tennessee (17-10, 9-6 
SEC) ahead by four points, Stokes snatched the ball af-ter McRae missed a runner. Stokes made a layup, drew a foul on Murphy, and made his free throw to complete the three-point play and increase the Volunteers’ lead to 61-54 with 54.5 seconds left. 
“I feel like that pretty much 
sealed the deal,” Stokes said.
Injury update: Yeguete (right 
knee), Frazier (concussion) and Prather (facial laceration) have all been cleared by UF’s medi-cal staff to practice today, UF announced on Wednesday. 
Yeguete and Frazier could 
return for Florida’s home matchup against Alabama on Saturday. 
Florida previously thought 
Prather might have suffered his third concussion of the season during Tuesday night’s game. He exited the contest with 2:48 remaining. Prather started bleeding after taking a blow to the face from guard Mike Rosario on a rebound at-tempt.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Alligator Staff Writer
Jaterra Bonds remembers the sequence like it was yes-
terday. 
With 5 seconds remaining in Florida’s game at Ar -
kansas on Jan. 29, 2012, she had the opportunity to make 
amends for the Gators’ terrible second half. 
Florida took a 60-49 lead with 4:25 remaining on a 
layup by Jennifer George. But the Gators squandered the 11-point advantage and trailed 62-61 when Bonds was fouled by Razorbacks forward Ashley Daniels.
“I pump faked on the sideline thinking it was their cen-
ter, I shot the ball, and she fouled me,” Bonds said. “There was 5 seconds left, and I missed the first free throw. They called timeout to try and freeze me, and I made the sec-ond one.” 
Bonds forced overtime by making the second free 
throw, but the Gators eventually lost 73-72 in double over -time. 
Close losses have haunted Florida this season. The 
junior guard continues to be haunted by the missed free throw that could have potentially won the game. 
“I could have ended the game right there with 5 seconds 
left, but they came up, and they beat us in overtime,” Bonds said. “I think about that all the time. In my mind, when I shoot free throws, I think about that ex-act situation: 5 seconds left, and I have two free throws to win the game, and I miss one of them.” 
Bonds will have her first opportunity 
to earn revenge when the Gators face 
the Razorbacks tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
With only two games remaining in the regular season 
and the two teams tied for eighth in the Southeastern Con-ference, the matchup is also an opportunity for Florida to boost its seeding in the SEC Tournament, which begins on Wednesday.
“Arkansas and us are right there together,” coach 
Amanda Butler said.
“When you’re bunched up with someone, and there is 
still a pretty good clump of us, you’ve got to have those wins and put those teams behind you. At the same time, it is about generating momentum.” 
Momentum has been hard to come by for the Gators, 
who have won just three of their past 11 games. 
Butler hopes last year’s heartbreak will fuel Bonds and 
her teammates.
“She seemed to be recalling [last year’s game] in great 
detail, so that gives you a really good indication of how hard it is to get over,” Butler said. 
“I’m not surprised at all that Jaterra hasn’t forgotten 
how she felt, and I know she will be prepared, and her teammates and coaches will have complete confidence in her if she has that opportunity again.”

THE ADAM BOMB
  Florida’s dugout erupted when 
Taylor Gushue executed a sac-riﬁ  ce ﬂ  y to tie the game during 
the ninth inning of Tuesday night’s 7-6 loss to North Florida. 
  A play so routine has been any-
thing but for the Gators.
  There hasn’t been much good 
through nine games. Situational hitting has been atrocious. Balls are going under gloves. Pitchers can’t throw strikes. Runners are getting picked off. Florida baseball has been ugly and frustrating. 
  At 3-6, this isn’t time to panic. 
This young team just has to have fun. Forget the base-running blun-ders and ﬁ  elding miscues. Forget the strikeouts at the plate with run-ners on base. Forget the tight play the Gators have shown. 
  Florida looks like a team afraid 
of making mistakes. They look like a team playing on its heels. Every so often, there’s a sudden jolt of en-ergy. See Justin Shafer pumping his ﬁ  st after hitting a double in the ninth inning against UNF or Johnny Ma-gliozzi running off the mound after getting a strikeout to end an inning against UCF.
  It’s a 56-game regular season. All 
Florida has proved through nine games is that it isn’t winning 51.
  Effort has been there. This team 
isn’t lollygagging its way to a dismal start. Freshman Brady Roberson cited a lack of passion when asked what’s going on. Another freshman, Christian Dicks, didn’t have an an-swer. 
  The numbers tell the real story .   When faced with situational hit-
ting or pitching, the Gators haven’t come through. Florida is batting .253 this season with runners in scor-ing position, including a .172 mark during last weekend’s sweep at the hands of Florida Gulf Coast. Take away a 16-run outburst in a win against Duke on Feb. 17, and that number drops 77 points.
  Opposing left-handed batters are 
batting .310 against Florida’s left-handed relievers. The Eagles went 7 for 10 against the combination of Parker Danciu and Daniel Gibson.Having just one starting pitcher reach the sixth inning doesn’t do the bullpen any favors, either.
  After allowing three earned runs 
in 16.2 innings against Duke, Florida relievers gave up 17 earned runs in 16 innings against Florida Gulf Coast. 
  Inconsistency created even more 
questions for a team trying to replace nine players from last season. 
  A left-hander like a Steven Ro-
driguez, who got righties and left-ies out, hasn’t emerged. A starting pitcher like a Hudson Randall, who rarely gave up two-strike hits, hasn’t stepped up. A hitter like Mike Zuni-no, who always seemed to drive in a run is nowhere to be found.
  Florida lost special players af-
ter its three-year run to the College World Series. That’s becoming more evident with each rally killed at the plate and every leadoff walk surren-dered by a Florida pitcher.
  Losing 
redshirt se-nior center ﬁ  elder Ty-ler Thomp-son and 
No. 2 starter Karsten Whitson be-fore the season didn’t help, either. Thompson left the team for personal reasons. Whitson, the second half of what was supposed to be a powerful 1-2 punch with Jonathon Crawford at the front of the Gators’ rotation, underwent a season-ending shoul-der procedure on Feb. 14.
  What’s left is a talented team yet 
to ﬁ  nd the answers. 
  But UF can take solace in the fact 
that every team hits a rough patch at some point in a season. 
  Arizona, last year’s College 
World Series champion, dropped ﬁ  ve of nine games in Paciﬁ  c-12 Con-ference play.  South Carolina, repeat national 
champions in 2010 and 2011, lost four of nine games twice in 2011 and began 2010 a disappointing 6-4.
  LSU lost four of eight to close out 
the regular season before winning it all in 2009.
  Florida will ﬁ  gure it out. A staff 
with 65 combined years of college coaching experience will get this go-ing again.
  A day after their ﬁ  fth straight 
loss, the cracking sound of hard work could be heard from the bat-ting cages on Wednesday afternoon. Whistles and foghorns blasted from the football practice ﬁ  elds. Ground-skeepers patched up a wet spot be-hind the mound. The sun started to break through the clouds behind home plate. As gloomy as the season has been, one thing became clear. The Gators get to play baseball for another day .
