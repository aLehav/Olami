  Coach Will Muschamp celebrates after the Gators’ 37-20 come-from-behind victory against 
the Volunteers on Saturday at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tenn.

 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Will Mus-
champ called his team “soft” last No-
vember. Throughout the 2011 season, the Gators repeatedly struggled to ﬁ  nish close games.
  “We weren’t tough enough,” Mus-
champ said.
  In 2012, consecutive second-half ral-
lies on the road against Texas A&M and Tennessee have proven one thing — Florida is a changed team.
  “Nobody in that locker room thought 
for a second that we were out of that game,” Jeff Driskel said. “We know that 
we’re going to make big halftime adjust-
ments and win the game in the second half.”
  UF has outscored opponents 50-13 in 
the second half this season. In the fourth quarter, Florida holds a 27-0 advantage.
  “That’s something our kids have 
bought into,” Muschamp said. “We’re going to win the fourth quarter. They 
believe that. They have a strong belief. 
We grew up a lot last year.”
  The Gators won the fourth quarter 
against the Volunteers, but they got started on their comeback before the third quarter expired.
  During Saturday’s 37-20 victory 
against No. 23 Tennessee (2-1, 0-1 South-eastern Conference) at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tenn., No. 18 Florida (3-0, 2-0 SEC) scored 24 unanswered points in the ﬁ  nal 19 minutes.
  Trey Burton got the ball rolling by 
ﬁ  nding a hole and running 80 yards up 
the right sideline to score the game-tying 
touchdown with 3:15 to play in the third quarter. Earlier, Burton scored on a 14-yard rush up the left sideline. Both plays came in the wildcat formation, with An-dre Debose running away from Burton’s intended path on misdirection shifts.
  “Same play as the ﬁ  rst touchdown, 
just the opposite side,” Burton said of his game-tying touchdown run. “They have to respect Debose’s hand sweep. They overplayed it again for the sec-ond time. And Hunter (Joyer) came and pinned the linebacker, and I saw a hole and I ran.”
  The Venice native’s career-long 
touchdown run spurred 302 yards of 
total offense for Florida in the ﬁ  nal 18 
minutes and 27 seconds. In all, UF tal-lied 555 yards against UT.

It may be 2012, but Sunday marked 
the start of 5773 as well.
About 150 Jewish students donning 
orange and blue yarmulke gathered for a candle lighting ceremony to start 
off Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New 
Year, at UF Hillel.
This year’s Rosh Hashana marks 
the 5773rd year in the Jewish calendar. Rosh Hashana began Sunday night and ends Tuesday evening.“It’s a time to reﬂ  ect on the past 
year,” said Melissa Stern, engagement associate at UF Hillel, “and to think of the good and the not so good.”
Stern said there are about 8,500 
Jewish students at UF.
The candle lighting ceremony Sun-
day night at the Norman H. Lipoff Hall lobby was led by campus Rabbi Gail Swedroe. Before she began the blessing of the candles, Swedroe asked students to think about what light they wanted to bring into the new year.Students gather at UF

The UF Supreme Court met Friday and 
ruled that two referendums passed the neces-
sary technical procedures to be placed on the October elections ballot.
However, only one of them was approved 
to be on the ballot.
Earlier this semester, the court had approved 
both referendums — one regarding newspa-per racks and the other about a name change for the Reitz Union. At that point, the authors needed to gather 500 signatures and re-submit to the court again for ﬁ  nal approval.
On Friday, the court approved the referen-
dum asking students whether or not they think UF should move forward with forcing publica-tions to be distributed out of university-owned racks. The decision on the referendum asking students if they would want to rename the Re-itz Union was postponed.
A former Supervisor of Elections and cur-
rent law student, Ariana Alfonso, addressed 
the court about the Reitz Union referendum. 
She took issue with the way the referendum’s  author, Sen. Ford Dwyer, went about passing it. He chose to get 500 signatures instead of passing a resolution on the Senate ﬂ  oor.
“It could potentially be a loophole if the 
court does not uphold its inherent power of re-view,” Alfonso said after the hearing.
Although the court wasn’t aware of her con-
cerns before, it allowed her to discuss them.UF Supreme Court approves one

McDonald’s announced Wednesday it will start to include calorie information on its menus. A Big Mac is 
550 calories, and a 10-piece McNuggets is 470 calories, according to the McDonald’s website.
Sept. 18, 1962: UF Fall registration hits an all-time 
high of 13,783 students, an increase of 149 students 
from the year before. Only 4,084 women are regis-tered, compared to 9,699 men. The greatest percent-age of men are in the College of Engineering, in which 
there are 1,190 men and nine women.
Sept. 19, 1985:  Only 31 students can access UF 
computer systems directly from their residence hall 
rooms. Rooms on the second and third floors on Fletcher’s Island and Fletcher library have the wiring for access. UF Housing director James Grimm said students had been complaining about long lines at computer centers, like the one in Weil Hall. “It is pos-
sible that within five years we will have a computer 
network in most — if not all — of the dorms,” said Mark Hale, director of the Center for Instructions and Research Computing Activities. 
Sept. 17, 1993:  UF coach Steve Spurrier hints 
that redshirt freshman quarterback Danny Wuerffel will start Saturday’s Southeastern Conference game against Tennessee at Florida Field instead of junior 
Terry Dean. Some suggest the annual game between 
Florida and Tennessee ranks among the more tradi-tional SEC rivalries. “Hopefully , it’s kind of our turn this year, but I don’t think it’s going to be a blowout,” said UF senior guard Jim Watson.
Sept. 20, 2002: The search continues for the winner 
of a $10 million jackpot lottery ticket that was sold at a Gainesville food store. Sprint Food Store, at 9303 
NW 39th Ave., sold the only winning ticket. Sam Oli-
ver, lottery director of communications, said the odds of winning this jackpot were about one in 23,000,000.

Jessica Nascimento went to McDon-
ald’s for her favorite frappe, but she 
soon realized it would cost her more than she expected.
McDonald’s Corp. announced 
Wednesday it will begin to include calorie information on restaurant and drive-thru menus nationwide.
Though Nascimento still got the 
frappe, she said she was surprised by the numbers on other menu items.“People could see 1,000 calories and 
get turned off,” the 19-year-old tele-communication junior said.
The calorie information is part of a 
larger nutrition-geared initiative an-nounced by McDonald’s in July 2011. McDonald’s also published a nutrition 
progress report and added changes to 
the 2013 menu that will include food groups recommended by the Depart-ment of Agriculture.
“I think McDonald’s is doing it, be-
cause they have really committed them-selves to nutrition,” said Gainesville McDonald’s spokeswoman Katelea Burkhart. “We changed the Happy 
Meal to include apple slices, and this is 
just another step in educating the cus-tomers.”
Bobbi Langkamp-Henken, a UF 
food science and human nutrition pro-fessor, said it can be daunting to edu-cate the public about nutrition.
“Everyone underestimates how 
many calories you require each day ,” 
she said. “If you don’t know how many 
calories you need, how do you interpret the calorie board?”
However, Langkamp-Henken said 
she is glad that the fast-food chain is taking steps to be health conscious.
“I’m interested in how many calo-
ries are in each thing so I can make an informed decision,” she said.

Dr. Terri Bunch turned in her bed to face 
her visitor.
“You know I’m very comfortable with 
you,” she said, “but if you start to blubber, 
you’re out the door.”
And then she lifted her finger and point-
ed at the door, causing her friend and co-worker to laugh. Bunch smiled, satisfied.
“She just had a sense of humor that 
never ended,” recalled Debbie Ringdahl, nurse practitioner in pediatric neurology at Shands at UF.
A few days later, on Sept. 7, Bunch, a UF 
pediatric neurologist, died after a three-year 
battle with breast cancer. She was 65.
Bunch was born in Knoxville, Tenn., but 
left her humble beginnings to attend the 
University of California, Berkeley. She later moved to the United Kingdom, where she studied medicine at the University of Cam-bridge and met her husband, Guy Carter. She lived there for 20 years.
Colleagues and co-workers can’t talk 
about Bunch without smiling. They remem-ber her as an intelligent, humorous adven-turer who would do anything to make her patients feel at ease, even when introducing herself.
“Dr. Bunch,” she would say , “as in a 
bunch of bananas.”
After returning from England, Bunch 
began her residency in adult neurology at 
UF, but it was during a three-month rota-
tion in the pediatric division that she found her passion.
So Bunch, undeterred by the fact that 
she was now in her mid 40s, finished her residency and began a new residency with the pediatric division.
“She was not ever going to quit,” Ring-dahl said. “She saw something ahead of her that she wanted to do, and she did it. Noth-ing ever got in her way.”
Bunch then practiced in Savannah, 
Ga., and St. Petersburg before returning to Gainesville in 2010. She brought along toys, chairs and stickers from her private prac-
tice in Savannah and shared them with the 
pediatric neurology division at Shands at UF, hoping to create a more child-friendly atmosphere.
But Dr. Paul Carney, chief of the divi-sion, said she brought more than material possessions.
“If I ever needed words of wisdom, if I 
ever needed help, I would turn to her,” he said. “She was not only intelligent, she was wise.”
While numerous chemotherapy treat-
ments changed Bunch’s physical appear -
ance throughout her short three years in the pediatric neurology division, her outlook on life that never changed.
Ringdahl said Bunch kept her patients 
and staff laughing.
“She’d take her wig off in the office and 
scratch her head, then put her wig back on backward or sideways,” she said, laughing 
along with her co-workers.
Carter said her enthusiasm for life 
brought her through the daily nausea and 
pain that her treatments caused.  
There were high points, he said. In 
April, doctors told Bunch that her PET scan showed her last chemotherapy treatment had stopped the cancer from spreading.
“She came home, and we danced around 
the car,” Carter said.
But Bunch’s health began to deteriorate 
over the summer, and she stopped going to work near the end of July . 
She spent her last few days with fam-
ily , reading notes that her colleagues wrote for her and snuggling with her Chihuahua, Miss Kitty.
Bunch is survived by her husband, Guy 
Carter; one son, Chris (Louise) Wells; one grandson, Arthur Wells; and two sisters, Fran Henriques and Teresa Leveque.
Carter said there will be a void now that 
she is gone.
“She was the most intelligent person 
I’ve ever met,” he said. “That, coupled with her love of life, just made her extremely special.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2012

The atmosphere on the Plaza of the 
Americas on Saturday morning was 
tense  with anticipation.
Nathalia Leal, a 21-year-old psychol-
ogy and criminology senior, paced ex-citedly as she prepared herself to take a plunge.
She and more than 300 other UF stu-
dents registered to volunteer around Gainesville as part of the the Center for Leadership and Service’s 13th annual Gator Plunge. Participants didn’t know 
until they arrived where they’d end up — 
Alachua Conservation Trust, Kids Count in Alachua County Inc. and Wilmot Gar -
dens were just three of the organizations 
benefiting from the day’s events.
Gator Plunge allows UF students to 
get involved in their adopted communi-
ty, event coordinator Maria Muñoz said.
“Your four years here don’t have to be 
spent just in books,” she said. “You can definitely give back to the community you live in.”
For Leal, that meant joining 14 other 
students in helping residents of Ta-
cachale, a developmental disability cen-
ter, play putt-putt golf, serving ice cream and giving out cotton candy.
“I had never worked with or met 
adults with developmental disabilities,” Leal said. “I wasn’t sure what to even ex-pect.”
As soon as the first resident, Wayne, 
came up to her station, she knew it was 
going to be a good day. 
Wayne, one of Tacachale’s biggest 
jokesters, started laughing, jumping 
around and teasing staff members.
Tacachale volunteer coordinator Rosa 
B. Williams said residents always enjoy groups coming to visit. 
She said it’s an educational experience 
for both the volunteers and residents.
“They see new people, and all the at-
tention is on them,” said Center Admin-istrator Michael S. Mayfield. “They really enjoy that interaction.”
Mayfield said help from UF students 
is great because they can help future gen-erations understand there is a place for the developmentally disabled popula-tion in society.
The overall experience was reward-
ing, Leal said. 
She said it only took a few hours, 
and she learned a lot about locals she 
wouldn’t normally have met.
“Not only do you impact your com-
munity, but your community impacts 
you,” Leal said.Gators plunge

Davis McGlathery set up an easel 
near a large flower garden and got to 
work.
She blended brown and green 
acrylic paint and started to paint the 
vibrant scene of trees and bushes be-
fore her.
McGlathery joined 15 other paint-
ers at the 62-acre Kanapaha Botani-cal Gardens throughout the week-end for the Worldwide Artist Paint Out. The event will raise money for the gardens through art sales.
Artists spread in the gardens 
to paint scenes of butterflies, trails lined with springy plants and trees that towered above the canvases.
Residents meandered in and out,  
watching the artists work. 
“It’s a good excuse to be outdoors 
and have fun with other painters and the public,” McGlathery said.
International Plein Air Paint-
ers sponsored the Worldwide Art-
ist Paint Out. Members were en-
couraged to paint outdoors Friday through Sunday.
Event coordinator Tim Malles 
said each artist produced about three pieces of art throughout the weekend.
Forty percent of the proceeds 
from the sale of the art will go to Ka-
napaha Botanical Gardens.
Malles said the event was hosted 
at the gardens to bring attention to 
nature sites within the city.

Hundreds of children swam, 
biked and ran for a cause on 
Saturday.
Kids4Kids Florida Charities 
Inc. hosted the Fifth Annual 
Triathlon and Fun Run, which 
benefitted Shands Children’s Hospital, Child Advocacy Center and One Room School 
House. Children ages 4 to 18 
could participate in the events, 
which were held at Haile Plan-
tation Golf and Country Club.
Joli Day, one of the event 
organizers and the O2B Kids representative, said this was the biggest year yet in terms of turnout and money raised. The annual events raised about $26,000 total in the last few 
years, Day said.
“We were doing triathlons and doing different things and 
thought it would be so much fun to have the kids do one but make it where the kids are rais-ing money for other, less-fortu-nate children,” Day said. “And it just took off.”
Michael Keller, a 24-year-old 
sports management junior and volunteer from UF’s TriGators triathlon team, said he likes having the opportunity to give back to the community. 
“It’s good to expose chil-
dren to healthier options and get them thinking a little differ -
ently and paying a little more 
attention to their body, because 
it relates to the mind,” Keller said.
Jhett Hill, 9, ran the triathlon, 
which consisted of a 50-yard swim, 1-mile bike and half-mile run, in the 7- to 9-year-old divi-sion. 
“We love them being active,” 
said Jerry Hill, Jhett’s dad. “It’s worth the time and effort to get up early on a Saturday morn-ing to do it. We support them all the way.”
Ava Joy, 12, competed in the 
10- to 12-year-old division, par -
ticipating in a 100-yard swim, 2-mile bike and 1-mile run. She 
first attended the event last year 
to help support a friend’s little brother, she said, and decided to return this year.
She finished second in her 
age division
“It was really fun and good, 
and I think I did really well,” Ava said. Kids push their limits to help 
people in need during triathlon

for your turn?
Seriously, what a doo-doo head.
This kid knew the rules and wanted to make sure 
everybody followed them, a believer in a school-sanc-tioned system of justice.
Everybody hated that kid, and it was only a matter 
of time before he pissed off the oversized giant in your class and subsequently got taught the lesson, “Snitches get stitches.”
Turns out he was only following the wrong set of 
rules.
I was reminded of this for two reasons:First, the tattletale of my kindergarten class added 
me on Facebook recently. I was the weird kid in my class who kept to myself — and thankfully never really got picked on for it, probably because I was really weird — but I still knew enough to ostracize the tattletale. That friend request is still sitting in my notifications, and I’m 
probably not going to approve it.
Second, I’ve either been in or observed a lot of situ-
ations as of late that have tested someone’s loyalty, and 
it’s been making me stress eat like a motherlover.
It’s become such a problem that a co-worker of mine 
saw me guzzling down a box of Krispy Kreme dough-nuts alone in my car with “Bad Romance” blasting in the background and felt prompted to ask if I was OK.
I was dressed in my typical paint-stained shirt and 
pajama bottoms and I-don’t-need-no-man slippers. There was no sugarcoating the situation.
Sadly, that is not the first time something like that 
has happened to me. 
I started to ponder the sorts of situations that got me 
to this point in the first place. I thought back to my les-sons on Derrida and deconstructing the binomial oppo-sitions inherent to Western thought.An example of this concept is 
Goldilocks and the Three Bears; Western thought presents the porridge as too hot or too cold, and deconstruction tries to elu-
cidate the many shades of just 
right.
The concept I constantly 
grappled with was loyalty.
But the opposition to be 
faced here wasn’t disloyalty — it was honesty.
I have a tendency to remain loyal to organizations 
and people who, at one point or another, require me to be dishonest with myself. And I externalize the result-
ing conflict with food.
It’s like trying to drive a car that won’t start.
The key is in the ignition, and the air conditioning 
and stereo work just fine, but when you try to start up the car, you’re not able to go where you need to go. I make this analogy because this was the situation I found myself in at the Krispy Kreme parking lot that fateful evening.
Take Watergate, for example.
Quite a few members of the Committee for the Re-
Election of the President loved Nixon and supported his 
ideals, but they knew that quite a few committee activi-ties were wrong. Their loyalty to Nixon became pitted against their desire to be forthcoming about CREEP’s ethics, and quite a few of them chose to remain silent on the issue.
This problem isn’t one that gets easier to handle with 
age.
Right now, a lot of students are starting to feel loy-
al to their courses of study, their professors who like them, their extracurriculars, their employers and, soon enough, their spouses.
Figuring out how to balance your loyalties with hon-
esty will only become more of a challenge.
Chip Skambis is a telecommunication senior at UF. His 
column appears on Mondays.Rick Santorum doesn’t want us on his side — neither as journalists nor as college students.
We’re too smart for him.
“We will never have the media on our side, ever, in this coun-
try,” Santorum said during his speech at the Values Voter Sum-
mit this weekend. “We will never have the elite smart people on 
our side, because they believe they should have the power to tell you what to do.  So our colleges and universities, they’re not going to be on our side.”
Would he prefer a media unit that was too dumb to report the 
truth? Because, believe us, it’s a lot harder to be truthful than it is to just make stuff up. Reporters and journalists try their damnd-est to be fair, to report honest facts and to present all sides of a story — not just “both” sides.
We don’t believe that we have the power to tell you, the read-
er, what to do. It’s our job to give you the facts and then let you come up with your own opinions and thoughts. 
That’s how it works. Sorry, Santorum, if the truth sometimes 
sucks from your point of view.
That also goes for Michele Bachmann, another speaker at Val-
ues Voter Summit 2012.
“Before I start, I just want to say a word about this concept 
that you’ve heard about called the war on women, the so-called 
war on women,” Bachmann said on Friday. 
“And I just want to say I think it has about as much reliability 
and truthfulness as Bill Clinton’s arithmetic,“ she said, referring 
to Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Convention.
Secondly, the “war on women” is a whole other issue. She 
wants to dismiss it as if it’s something that’s not happening, that women should feel silly for feeling slighted in any sense by members of, mostly, the Republican Party.
She went on to talk about the current violent riots and pro-
tests across the world.
“There is a very real war that is going on across the world, 
and that’s what I want to take my few moments together that we have this morning,” Bachmann said. “I sit on the Intelligence Committee. We deal with the nation’s classified secrets. And this is a very real issue.”
Do you know what else is a very real issue?The fact that it’s the same woman who said things like this: 
“The Muslim Brotherhood has been found to be an unindicted 
co-conspirator on terrorism cases and yet it appears that there 
are individuals who are associated with the Muslim Brother -
hood who have positions, very sensitive positions, in our De-partment of Justice, our Department of Homeland Security, po-tentially even in the National Intelligence Agency.”
She led what some have called an “Islamophobic witch-
hunt,” so we think it’s safe to say that we don’t want her in charge of anything, let alone in charge of intelligence.
Maybe you disagree with journalists and what they have to 
say . And that’s fine. Feel free to disagree with what anyone has 
to say.
Just realize that we report the facts, whether you like what 
those facts are or not.Sorry, not sorry

I was pleased to see your coverage 
of the Florida Modern Slavery Museum 
(“Traveling slavery museum shows abuse of farmworkers”). The shock expressed by visitors about the existence of slavery is far from uncommon. While most of us 
are taught about past slavery and the Civil 
War in our high school history classes, we are not told it exists as an illegal market today. Kevin Bales, professor of contem-porary slavery at the University of Hull, estimates there are 27 million people in slavery today, more than ever before in history. This phenomenon is not confined to poorer nations; human rights groups es-timate 14,500 slaves are illegally trafficked into the United States annually and forced to work in labor or prostitution. I strongly encourage UF students to donate to chari-
ties and spread the word so that together, 
we can end this evil institution in our life-times.

I am an immigrant from a country that doesn’t always 
protect the rights of individuals. One of the many things that I have come to appreciate over the years is 
freedom of speech and press. It is such a fundamental part of our culture and society that many of us don’t appreci-
ate it — we tend to take it for granted.
If you want to see how integral free speech is here at 
UF, just walk around Turlington Plaza. People from all 
walks of life advertise there for their events, causes and is-sues. Publications like The Fine Print, the Odyssey and the Alligator are distributed there freely, providing entertain-ment and important information to the Student Body.
What if all of that was taken away? What if your elect-
ed representatives thought otherwise and did nothing to 
protect those rights? Take a moment to think about it.
This past Summer Semester, the Student Senate failed 
to protect your right to information and press.
Students Party senators tried their best to keep the ma-
jority from the Unite Party (most of whom are now mem-
bers of the “new” Swamp Party) from passing an election code revision that limits election campaigning to a week.
The campaign revisions, championed by Christina 
Bonarrigo and other leaders of the Swamp Party, were 
so far-reaching that any post on Facebook in support of a 
party or candidate for office could get them into trouble.
If I were to tell you to vote for my party, I would risk 
having our entire ticket disqualified, handing the election 
to the people who made this new rule.
To make things even 
worse, the same Swamp Party senators also voted against a 
resolution that asked the UF administration to halt their efforts at removing independently owned newspaper racks from campus — most are owned by The Indepen-dent Florida Alligator and have been around for more than three decades.
To add insult to injury , the administration is making 
all publications sign a licensing agreement that effectively leaves their continued presence on campus at the mercy of the university. To say this threatens editorial indepen-
dence would be a major understatement.
All of this is a reaction to last Spring’s historic election.
In February , we saw the highest voter turnout ever in a 
UF election of this kind, and the Alligator rightly reported on an effort involving a current Swamp Party senator to dispose of copies of the newspaper on the day it reported Coach Muschamp’s endorsement of the Students Party.
Having nearly lost power, Bonarrigo and friends are 
desperate to crush all opposition and suppress any dis-
senting voices. The fact that the Unite Party has been mys-
teriously replaced by the Swamp Party says all you need to know about the state of its reputation.
Because of the new campaign laws, I’m not even sure if 
I’m allowed to tell you about a referendum question relat-ing to the Alligator racks or even when you can vote on the matter. That’s how oppressive these new rules are.
But if, hypothetically, you happen to hear of an up-
coming Student Government election where you have a 
chance to stand up for freedom of expression, I certainly 
hope you’ll take the chance to do so.

could be hindered by political actionsGuest column
On Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu publicly denounced President Barack Obama for failing to draw clear “red lines” around Iran’s nu-
clear program and rebuked the United States’ “moral right” to hold Israel back from independent military action.
This statement blatantly ignores the strategic implications 
of creating such thresholds and appears timed to back the president into a foreign policy corner leading up to Election Day. Netanyahu’s searing criticism of Obama is unreason-able at best and shameless politicking at worst.
From a strategic standpoint, it makes very little sense for 
the U.S. to bind itself to military action based on the levels of uranium enrichment achieved by Iran’s nuclear endeav-ors. Quite simply , creating an enrichment boundary beyond 
which a military strike is guaranteed would commit Ameri-
can forces to an assault whose probability of long-term ef-fectiveness is dubious at best.
Though a report last month from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency concluded that Iran has enough partially en-riched fuel to make five or six bombs, nuclear experts like Is-raeli physical chemistry professor Uzi Even suspect that Iran has succeeded in covertly producing enough bomb-quality fuel to perform a test explosion in secret.
If Iran is already nuclear, which Tehran has predictably 
denied, then the designation of an unacceptable level of ura-nium enrichment is essentially irrelevant.
At the same time, the risks of allowing Iran to obtain a 
weapon should not be discounted. Such a development would almost certainly embolden Iran in its support of Syria, Hezbollah and other undesirables in the Middle East while dramatically increasing the chances for war — either con-ventional or nuclear — in the region and perhaps enabling 
greater nuclear proliferation, which would all be spectacular 
foreign policy failures for the United States.
However, there lies a silver lining in the distinct unlikeli-
hood of an Iranian nuclear strike.
From both practical and logistical perspectives, Iran has little reason and almost certainly lacks the technical skill to launch an effective warhead.
Tehran realizes that American 
and Israel second-strike capabilities, 
particularly when combined, could wipe Iran off the map within minutes of an initial Iranian attack.
Iran’s decision to pursue uranium rather than plutonium-
based enrichment ensures that any bomb it could produce in the near future would be far too heavy to be borne any ap-preciable distance by its existing ballistic missiles.
All told, Obama has been correct in remarking that the 
United States and Israel have “time and space” to reach a negotiated solution with Iran on its nuclear aspirations — the 
Iranians are still months and years away from being a cred-
ible nuclear threat.
Cold War-style containment may become a necessary op-
tion down the road, but today, continued sanctions and pres-sure represent the most sustainable and least confrontational plan. Then why the pointed indictment of Obama’s policies from Netanyahu?
There are evident political motivations in his attempt to 
elicit concessions from an American leader up for reelection 
in less than two months who cannot afford to be called soft 
on Iran or unsupportive of Israel. Brinkmanship on Iran may have worked when the president’s campaign was struggling and both Netanyahu and Republicans could take Obama to task for failing to lead on this issue.
But this sort of hardball is no longer effective — Obama 
has opened up a six-point lead on opponent Mitt Romney and is now the American people’s preferred handler of for -
eign policy, according to two ABC News polls.
Netanyahu would do well to tread more carefully around 
his country’s most important security ally rather than treat-ing the United States as a political tool.

A step show by six members 
of the National Pan-Hellenic 
Council on Friday kicked off the Black Student Union’s Uni-ty Fridays, a recurring event to 
showcase minority organiza-
tions working together.
The goal is to feature presen-
tations such as music, dance, food and community service from diverse groups at UF, 21-year-old food and resource economics senior Justin George said.The ﬁ  rst Unity Friday also 
included tabling by various so-cial and cultural organizations.
Chantelle Lewis, president 
of the Jamaican-American Stu-dent Association and 21-year-old sociology senior, said she tabled to promote her organiza-
tion. Being at busy Turlington 
helped with networking.
BSU president and 21-year-
old family youth and com-munity sciences senior Bryant Rora has been in contact with 30 different minority organiza-tions for Unity Fridays. They will be held the second Friday 
of every month and promote

As Latin music blared, people shook and 
dipped their hips with the beat.
People danced, savored dishes such as em-
panadas and celebrated the spirit of the Hispan-
ic culture at the 11th annual Downtown Latino 
Festival on Saturday at Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza. About 2,000 people attended the festival, according to David Ruiz, director of the festival.
The event highlights Hispanic Heritage 
Month, which began Saturday and ends Oct. 15.
“The event’s important, because there is not a 
lot of Latino events at this magnitude,” he said.
Instructors did Zumba routines, encourag-
ing children and young adults to follow along. A conga line of about 30 people broke out as the 
night went on.
Ruiz, who has been the event director for 
the past four years, said he wants the festival to 
show diversity in the community.
“It’s great to see the community supportive of 
the event,” he said.
David Armas, a 21-year-old UF advertising 
senior and member of the Hispanic Student As-sociation, said the event was not quite as busy 
as other years, but he was excited to grab tradi-
tional Hispanic food.
UF telecommunication senior Alex de Armas, 
21,  said she came to the festival with her friend to enjoy the friendly atmosphere.
“Anywhere we can get together with other 
Hispanics is great,” de Armas said.Downtown festival celebrates

UF students might sound like 
Founding Fathers to people passing 
Library West today.
V olunteers will read sections of the 
U.S. Constitution at noon for the 225th 
anniversary of its signing. The event, 
UF Reads the Constitution, is spon-sored by the Smathers Libraries.
About 500 free Constitution hand-
outs will be available, said Interna-tional Documents librarian Chelsea Dinsmore.“We would like to read through the 
Constitution, but if a discussion starts, we are not going to stop it — as long as it remains civil,” she said.
It’s important that political candi-
dates’ platforms are coherent with the general interpretation of the Constitu-
tion, said Prashant Kansakar, a 26-year-
old industrial and systems engineering graduate student.
“Our president’s job is to defend the 
Constitution,” he said. “The majority of voters don’t vote on that basis, but I think theoretically, in the ideal world, it should be that way.”Students read Constitution

Supreme Court disagreed on ability to rule on constitutionality
On Sunday, Dwyer said some people be-
lieve he used “backdoor avenues” to get his 
referendum passed. But other senators have used the same method of getting a referendum on the ballot, including Sen. Dave Bradshaw, 
the author of the racks referendum.
“It’s not about procedure, it’s about the 
Hawkins issue,” Dwyer said.
Dwyer proposed changing the name of the union to the Virgil Hawkins Student Union af-
ter an African-American man who was denied entrance to UF in 1949 due to his race.
After the hearing, Chief Justice Matt Michel 
said the court has not yet formed an opinion on whether or not it is appropriate for a sena-tor to gather signatures instead of passing a resolution on the Senate ﬂ  oor.
The court also ruled it didn’t have the abil-
ity to interpret state and federal constitutions.
Bradshaw petitioned the court on whether it had the ability to rule on constitutionality, referenc-ing the possible restriction of free speech as it applies to the code stating that “cam-paign activities begin on the 
ﬁ  rst day of the election cycle and ends immediately after 
the close of polls on the ﬁ  nal 
day of elections.”
Associate Justice Tim Mason was the sole dissenting voice on the constitutionality rul-
ing. He said the court’s jurisdiction was lim-ited to the statutes of UF, but in ruling so, the court cannot disregard broader rules.
However, the court stated that the code 
that Bradshaw petitioned was not vague.
“I’m disappointed in particular in regard 
to its inability to rule on constitutional issues,” 
Bradshaw said.

SC , from page 1Students gathered for lighting ceremony, meal and services
“Rosh Hashana always coincides with the beginning of 
the school year,” Swedroe said. “It’s a great opportunity to 
make new resolutions to make things better.”
A few students held tealight candles while two larger 
candles were lit with a small Albert ﬁ  gurine.
Swedroe, a conservative rabbi, and Hillel’s ﬁ  rst female 
rabbi, joined Hillel in July.
“It’s always exciting being in a new community for the ﬁ  rst time,” Swedroe said.
After the ceremony, students separated into three ser-
vices. Hillel held Reform, Conservative and traditional ser-vices to cater to every denomination. A meal followed the service at 9 p.m.
The Reform Jewish service was the largest of the three 
services. Rabbi Melissa Zalkin Stollman, a UF graduate, traveled from New York to Gainesville to help with the 
service. The service, with a congregation of about 100, was 
held in the dining hall decorated with white lights strung across the ceiling.
Keith Dvorchik, CEO and executive director of Hillel, 
said he was happy to see students excited about the holi-day.
“It’s one of those times when students connect, even if 
they’re busy,” Dvorchik said.
Health science freshman Serena Martin, 18, attended the 
candle lighting ceremony with her roommate and said she 
enjoyed participating in the tradition.

Bells attached to dancers’ ankles 
jingled quietly as the lights dimmed 
in the Reitz Union Ballroom on Sat-urday night.
Roughly 850 people hushed 
in excitement as Praharsha 2012 kicked off its seventh year.
The annual cultural fest is meant 
to showcase the best of Indian cul-ture: its dancing, music and food. In Sanskrit, “praharsha” means ex-treme happiness.
Nalini Kumar, a 24-year-old 
electrical engineering Ph.D. stu-
dent, has organized Praharsha for 
the last two years.
“It’s more about getting every-
one together,” she said. “It’s the beginning of Fall, so new students come in, and we want to get them together and let them enjoy some Bollywood music.”
Praharsha is put on by Gators 
for Asha and UF Student Govern-ment.
Gators for Asha is UF’s chapter 
of Asha for Education, a nonprofit organization with programs in var -
ious parts of India.
The main goal of Asha for Edu-
cation is to provide education to underprivileged and oppressed 
children in India.
Preparations for the event start 
at least five months in advance ev-
ery year, said 26-year-old chemi-cal engineering graduate student Lokendra Bengani, co-president of Gators for Asha.
After a few moments of silent 
darkness in the Grand Ballroom, enthusiastic emcees entered and, il-luminated by a spotlight, hyped up the crowd.
The performances included tra-
ditional Indian music and rendi-tions of contemporary Indian pop songs.
In a performance of classical northern Indian music, members of a five-person band sat on the floor to perform their 10-minute routine.
“It is traditional to sit on the 
floor,” singer Mihika Kulkarni, a 22-year-old mechanical and aero-space engineering graduate stu-dent, said. “In all Indian classical music, northern and southern, no-body stands.”
At the end of the show, the Desi 
Gators dance group lined up on the edge of the stage as a popular In-
dian song started to play. The stu-
dent-heavy crowd screamed and clapped its hands.
When the final song of the night 
played, the dance group jumped from the stage and ran into the cheering crowd.
After the performances, the 
second floor of the Reitz Union 
was filled with trays of traditional 
Indian dishes including vegetable curry, raita and pulao.
Event organizers said all of the 
food was vegetarian.
The smells of cinnamon, nut-
meg and coriander wafted together as people walked around trying 
dishes.
The walls were decorated with 
traditional Indian garb: colorful 
ghagra cholis, saris and lehengas.
Event organizers chose the name 
“praharsha” because they wanted 
to exemplify the joy that goes into 
all aspects of the yearly event.
Shweta Bhagat, a 23-year-old 
UF graduate student studying in-formation systems and operations management, and one of the em-cees, said all of the volunteers are essential to Asha’s events.
“It’s fun to be around lively and 
fresh people,” she said. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Trey Burton sprints 80 yards to the end zone for UF’s second touchdown in its 37-20 victory against Tennessee on Saturday at Neyland Stadium.
  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Staff Writer
  KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — With 
the Gators down a touchdown 
and looking for a spark, coach 
Will Muschamp outsmarted 
himself and put his team in a bind.
  Then Trey Burton came to the 
rescue.
  After the defense forced a 
three-and-out following a failed 
fake punt at its own 
45, Florida 
started the 
next drive with Trey Burton un-der center and quarterback Jeff 
Driskel lined up at wide receiv-
er. 
Speed took over the game for 
Florida.
  “Very resilient for our kids,” 
Muschamp said. “They over-come our coaching a lot and I think in that situation they cer-tainly did. That was a huge turn-
ing point.”
  Burton took the direct snap 
and beat the Volunteers defense 
to the outside. A stiff-arm down the ﬁ  eld freed the junior for a career-long 80-yard touchdown run.
  “I knew he was fast. I didn’t 
know he had that kind of speed,” Driskel said. 
“I tried to catch him, just in 
case. I was running from the oth-er sideline, but I couldn’t quite 
get there. That was awesome. 
That was a huge play for us.”
  Until that point, Florida had 
allowed 319 yards of offense, in-
cluding a 12 play, 81-yard touch-
down drive that put Tennessee ahead 20-13. 
On the next UT possession 
following Burton’s touchdown, 
Buck linebacker Lerentee Mc-
Cray pressured quarterback Ty-ler Bray into an interception to safety Matt Elam.
  Florida responded with 17 
unanswered points.
  The Volunteers had not 
learned from the ﬁ  rst time Bur-ton ran the read-option. 
Burton went untouched for a 
14-yard touchdown in the ﬁ  rst quarter for Florida’s ﬁ  rst touch-down.
  “It was a shock,” Volunteers 
coach Derek Dooley said. “No-body recognized it. We weren’t able to route. It was just a bad play. I don’t know what else to say.”
  Tennessee linebacker Herman 
Lathers added: “It’s more of the outside guys and the safeties. It just didn’t ﬁ  t right. We didn’t get to all of the checks that we 
needed to go to. It was just mis-
takes.”
  Whatever the problem, Ten-
nessee didn’t have an answer 
for Burton, who ﬁ  nished with 
three carries for 91 yards and two touchdowns. He added 38 receiving yards.
  “We felt like we had the 
counter on the backside and it was blocked beautifully,” Mus-champ said. 
“They overpursued the speed 
sweep. Trey cut it back outside and outran them.”
Team effort with rushing at-
tack: In front of 102,455 fans and 
a Volunteers defense expecting 
the run, the Gators were without their top offensive weapon.

 While Kentucky had a week to pre-
pare for Florida, the Gators only had one day to prepare for the Wildcats. 
UF’s freshmen had to learn a new 
game plan while trying to adjust to playing on the road for only the sec-ond time.
  But outside hitters Ziva Recek and 
Gabby Mallette rose to the occasion.
  “These players matured in front of 
our eyes,” coach Mary Wise said. “To come in to Memorial Coliseum with 
as talented a team as Kentucky is, 
knowing that they had a week to pre-pare for us, I really wondered, ‘Could we do it in a day?’ The game plan that 
Dave (Boos) had, I knew it was awe-
some. The issue was we had to put so much time in the Arkansas prepara-tion, could we do it with a lot more video than time on the court?” 
  Offensively, Recek and Mallette combined for only 10 kills, but de-fensively the two tallied 7 digs and 4 blocks as they helped No. 13 Florida 
(8-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) 
sweep No. 24 Kentucky (6-5, 0-1 SEC) in a 3-0 (25-21, 25-14, 25-18) victory for the ﬁ  rst time at Lexington, Ky., since Nov. 11, 2007.
  “They’re not even a month into 
their career, and we’re just talking 
them through it and walking 
them through 
every scenario 
because we couldn’t practice it,” Wise said. “We’ve had some freshman that you could talk for days, and they 
wouldn’t be able to catch on mentally. 
Dave’s worked with Ziva and Gabby, and those two did not look like fresh-man defensively at all.”
  The growth of the freshmen wasn’t 
the only factor that helped the Gators grab their second straight win of their Mature freshmen spark win JURNY DUTY

  When Will Muschamp named Jeff 
Driskel his starting quarterback the Monday after Florida’s season-
opening 27-14 win over Bowling Green, his reasoning for doing so seemed obvious.
  The Gators’ offense was going to be predi-
cated on running the football. Running back 
Mike Gillislee had a career-best performance against the Falcons, running for 148 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries.
  With Gillislee blossoming into a workhorse 
back Florida could lean on, the Gators just needed a quarterback to manage the game. Driskel had shown a tendency to do just that, avoiding risks whenever possible. Conversely, 
Jacoby Brissett had proven to be more of a gun-
slinger who would take shots down the ﬁ  eld. Thus, it made sense that Muschamp would se-lect Driskel to be his game manager.
  On Saturday , Driskel proved he is much 
more than that.
  In a 37-20 win against Tennessee, the soph-
omore completed 14 of his 20 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran the 
ball eight times for 81 yards.
  What was more impressive than his raw numbers was the 
way he accumulated them in a ﬁ  lled-to-capacity Neyland Stadium. His 23-yard 
touchdown pass to 
Jordan Reed in the third quarter that gave the Gators a 27-
20 lead was one of multiple instances in which Driskel stood strong in the pocket, stepped up, completed a pass and took a hit.
  When the pocket wasn’t there, he used his 
legs to turn nothing into something, rather 
than running out of bounds for a loss, as he did 
against Texas A&M on multiple occasions.
  A perfect example of Driskel’s progress in 
those scrambling situations came late in the 
second quarter with the Gators trailing, 14-7. 
On a ﬁ  rst-and-15 play from the Volunteers’ 26-yard line, Driskel was immediately pressured up the middle but avoided a sack by scram-bling to his right. As he neared the sideline, he 
threw a perfectly placed ball to wide receiver 
Solomon Patton 17 yards downﬁ  eld for a ﬁ  rst down. Driskel ready to carry Gators

After Florida’s failed fake punt gave 
Tennessee’s offense the ball near midfield, Matt Elam blitzed on first down and forced an intentional grounding, putting UT in an early 
hole. The Vols punted three plays later, setting up the Gators’ game-tying score. The Volunteers were still within strik -
ing distance until Jeff Driskel found Frankie Hammond Jr. on a curl route, and Hammond did the rest for a 75-yard touchdown that gave the 
Gators a two-score lead.On Tennessee’s first drive after Burton scored to tie the game at 20, Matt Elam intercepted a pass with help from Lerentee McCray’s pass rush, keeping momentum on UF’s 
side. Three plays later, the Gators scored to take a lead they would never relinquish.Florida scored 24 unanswered points during second half
“We have athletes all over the field and 
we know if we keep giving them the ball and 
giving them touches that eventually they’re going to break,” Driskel said. “Fortunately for us, we hit a couple of big plays when we 
needed them and that really changed the 
momentum.”
Burton’s touchdown followed the Gators 
defense’s emphatic response to a failed fake punt. Safety Matt Elam carried the ball 5 yards on fourth and 9, and the Volunteers gained possession 47 yards away from in-creasing their 20-13 lead.
On Tennessee’s next play, Elam wrapped 
up quarterback Tyler Bray and forced an in-tentional grounding penalty. Two straight completions from Bray on second and third down could not make up for the 10 yards lost on the sack.
“We were right there,” UT coach Derek 
Dooley said. “We don’t get the protection, Tyler grounds it.”
When asked if the defensive stop was a 
testament to the Gators’ mental toughness, Jon Bostic said, “You can definitely say that, but we’ve still got a long way to go.”
Once Burton knotted the score at 20-20, 
Driskel took control of the Gators’ offense  in their season-best performance. He threw for 219 yards and two touchdowns while also picking up 81 yards on the ground, but his best effort came after halftime.
The sophomore signal-caller completed 
6 of 8 throws for 129 yards while engineer -
ing five scoring drives in the second half to spearhead Florida’s season-best 37-point ef-fort.The last time UF scored more than 30 
points on the road against a ranked oppo-nent was a 51-31 win against South Carolina in 2007.
“I still have a long way 
to go,” Driskel said. “I hit 
some big plays, and defi-
nitely got better from Game 1 to Game 2 and now Game 3. But I still have a long way to go.”
Muschamp added: “He 
made some gutsy plays and runs. He’s a tough kid, 
and he was very accurate with the football.”
Last season, Florida improved to 3-0 by 
defeating Tennessee but failed to capitalize on the undefeated start. 
Lopsided losses against BCS Champion-
ship Game participants Alabama and LSU crippled UF. Missed opportunities in close contests against Auburn, Georgia, South Carolina and Florida State sunk Florida.
“When I walk into the locker room at half-
time, there’s not anyone pointing fingers and there’s not anybody complaining or asking 
what’s going on out there,” Muschamp said. 
“Last year, to be quite honest, we had some of that.”
The Gators acknowledge their improve-
ments from last season, but they maintain a cautious optimism. Muschamp said UF is “not ready to wave the flags yet.”
But the second-year coach is more en-
couraged by this season’s fast start than he 
was by the 4-0 beginning to 2011. It’s early, 
but Florida has shown a knack for finishing strong.
“This is a different 3-0,” Muschamp said.Contact Joe Morgan at joemorgan@alligator.org.

Adriana Leon’s first goal in or -
ange and blue was golden.  
In the 100th minute, the junior 
striker booted a shot from 18 yards 
out to give No. 22 Florida (4-3-1, 
1-1 Southeastern Conference) a 
come-from-behind 2-1 win against Auburn (4-5, 0-2 SEC) in extra time on Sunday afternoon at the AU Soccer Complex. 
“It was really exciting,” Leon 
said. “It was great to finally put one in the back of the net.”
The  play began when senior 
Erika Tymrak was awarded a free kick after a foul. Choosing to re-start quickly, she sent a pass to Leon above the arc for the dagger. 
“We made eye contact,” Leon 
said, “and we just knew it was the right play.”
Senior Holly King added: “It 
was funny. After she scored, she said, ‘That wasn’t even a good shot.’ She wasn’t even celebrating. She was judging her own goal, but I’m sure it gave her confidence.”
Leon’s overtime game-winner 
is UF’s second this season and the first for the junior transfer from Notre Dame. On Aug. 26, Tymrak scored the golden goal in an upset of then-No. 2 Duke.
The rebound win for UF comes 
after a 2-1 loss to Kentucky on Friday night in Lexington, Ky. In that game, Florida relinquished an early lead. 
But Sunday’s match started dif-
ferently for the Gators. Auburn struck first in the fifth minute when Mary Coffed scored off a 
cross from Tati-
ana Coleman. 
“The differ -
ence between this game and 
last game is that 
we were way more patient, even though [Auburn] went 
up,” King said. “We just made sure to not panic, because they sat in the box. We just passed it around and tried to switch it as much as pos-sible.”
Down 1-0 at the half, coach 
Becky Burleigh expected her team to win. 
“I told the bench right after the 
starting team went out at halftime,” she said. “I said, ‘Get ready to run out on the field for the golden-goal celebration, because we’re going to win this.’”
The Gators equalized the score 
in the 73rd minute when King scored inside a crowded box. The pass came from senior Jo Dragotta on a set piece. 
After King’s goal, the Gators 
dominated the Tigers on both sides of the ball until the match ended.
“Auburn was a little tired, so 
we had them on their toes right where we wanted them,” King said. “Going into overtime, we 
were extremely confident, and we 
were able to put it away.”
Sunday added a significant 
chapter to the recent rivalry be-tween both teams. Last season, the Gators knocked off the Tigers 3-2 in overtime but fell to them in the SEC Tournament final. 
UF is now 3-2 in matches in 
which its opponent scores first.
The Gators held an 11-3 advan-
tage on corner kicks against the Ti-gers and outshot them 22-9. 
“It’s big, because it’s very, very 
difficult to play against a set de-fense,” Burleigh said. “To win against a team who did that speaks for us.”

Running back Mike Gillislee runs past defenders during UF’s 37-
20 victory against Tennessee on Saturday at Neyland Stadium.
Gillislee struggles early, shines lateSEC opening weekend. 
Veterans Betsy Smith, Tan-
gerine Wiggs and Chloe Mann 
held the Wildcats, who lead the 
SEC with 2.89 blocks per set, to just 2 blocks the entire match. 
The trio accumulated 32 
kills, hit .526 and accounted for half of the Gators’ eight blocks.
Florida also held Kentucky 
to a .150 hitting percentage, 
UK’s lowest against UF since 
Sept. 17, 2010.
The Wildcats’ 40-point total 
was the lowest they’ve scored 
in a match against the Gators 
since Nov. 16, 2003, when they managed only 39.
“When we look at this first road weekend, opening SEC weekend at Arkansas with all their returning talent coming 
back, at Kentucky; if you told 
me this would be a 2-0 sweep I’m not sure we would’ve be-lieved you,” Wise said. “We’ll compete and play hard, be-
cause that’s who the Gators 
are, but this win, this win was a month in the making, and I couldn’t be prouder of the 
players.”

kagostin@alligator.org.
Florida lost 3 yards on its first 
drive on a busted end-around by Andre Debose and runs by fresh-
man Matt Jones and quarterback Jeff Driskel.
After sitting out the first drive 
for undisclosed reasons, Gillislee struggled throughout the first half, gaining 14 yards on eight carries.
He sustained a groin injury in 
the fourth quarter last week against 
Texas A&M but grew stronger as 
the game progressed in Neyland Stadium.
The senior and top rusher in the 
Southeastern Conference piled up 115 yards on 18 attempts.
Florida averaged 9.7 yards per 
rush in the second half and fin-
ished with 336 rushing yards — 
its highest tally against Tennessee since 1977. The zone rushing attack caused 
Tennessee problems in the second half.
Six Florida rush attempts in 
the second half went 10 yards or more.
“I’m not surprised,” Lathers 
said. “Florida is a good football team. They work on it at practice. 
We just didn’t hit the right spots 
at the right time and they gashed us.”
Gators without Green: Florida set 
season highs for passing and rush-ing while missing its starting right tackle. 
The coaching staff ruled sopho-
more Chaz Green out with an ankle injury.
“Chaz Green had a bad ankle,” 
Muschamp said. “Not really sure 
what he’d be able to do.”
Green dealt with cramps last 
week in College Station, Texas.Junior guard Kyle Koehne start-
ed for Green at right tackle. 
Florida’s offensive line didn’t 
allow a sack to the Volunteers after giving up eight against the Aggies.
“Hats off to Kyle Koehne,” Mus-
champ said. 
“Stepped up and played right 
tackle. He’d been an inside player his entire career at Florida. Went 
up there and played right tackle. He did a heck of a job against guys like (Jacques) Smith and (Curt) 
Maggitt who can really rush the 
edge.”
Florida moving on up: Following 
their win in Knoxville against Ten-
nessee, the Gators moved up four 
spots to No. 14 in the latest AP poll. Four remaining opponents, LSU, FSU, Georgia and South Carolina, 
are in the top 10.

NOTES , from page 13Gillislee was effective again, rush-
ing for 115 yards on just 18 carries de-
spite battling a groin strain he suffered 
against Texas A&M last week. While 
the injury didn’t seem to affect him against Tennessee, the fact that it oc-curred in the first place shows that he 
is unlikely to stay healthy if the team 
leans on him as heavily as they did in the first two weeks.
Backups Mack Brown and Matt 
Jones haven’t proven they can compli-
ment Gillislee on the ground, so the 
passing game will have to take the bur -
den off of Gillislee from time to time. Driskel proved against the Volunteers he was capable of doing that.
“There’s nothing he does that makes 
me wonder, ‘I didn’t realize he could do that,’” Muschamp said of Driskel after the game. 
If Muschamp has so much confi-
dence in Driskel that the performance against Tennessee wasn’t surpris-ing, then he shouldn’t hesitate to ask 
Driskel to put the team on his back at 
any point the rest of the season.

 KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Tyler Bray’s 
throw might have been intended for Zach 
Rogers, but Lerentee McCray caught the 
pass.
  The redshirt seniors’s ﬁ  rst career in-
terception helped No. 14 Florida (3-0, 2-0 
Southeastern Conference) to a 37-20 victory 
against Tennessee (2-1, 0-1 SEC).
  “We deﬁ  nitely knew coming in that Ty-
ler Bray was an accurate quarterback that 
can ﬁ  t the ball into tight places,” McCray said. “We just had to frustrate him a little 
bit and make him hurry up more than he 
wanted to.”
  After intercepting Bray’s pass, McCray 
returned it for 25 yards to set Florida up on 
Tennessee’s 35-yard line. From there, Flor-
ida needed only three plays to ﬁ  nd the end zone and put the ﬁ  rst points of the game on the board.
  McCray’s interception wasn’t the only 
one of the night. 
Late in the third quarter with the score 
tied at 20, junior Matt Elam came up with Florida’s second interception on a pass in-
tended for Justin Hunter.
“When the ball ﬂ  oats up there and Matt 
is playing good center ﬁ  eld, he goes up and 
gets the football,” coach Will Muschamp said. “That’s huge points for us.”
Forcing turnovers was a major point of 
emphasis during the offseason for Mus-champ and defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn. Florida ﬁ  nished 2011 with a minus-12 
turnover margin and ranked No. 113 na-tionally with only 14 takeaways. 
The Gators have forced four turnovers in 
three games in 2012, good for a plus-three margin. 
  “Turnovers are always very important 
to give the offense another chance to put 
points on the board,” Elam said. “On de-fense, that’s our job and our objective, to put the ball back in the offense’s hands.”
      Elam’s pick added to the Gators’ mo-
mentum as they tacked on 10 more unan-
swered points in the fourth quarter.
  Prior to Elam’s interception, he notched 
the lone sack of the game for 10 yards in the 
middle of the second half. 
Elam wrapped up Bray, who committed 
an intentional grounding penalty trying to avoid a sack.
  While Elam’s pick was Bray’s last, the 
6-foot-6 signal caller never recovered. 
In the fourth quarter, Bray completed 
only 1 of 10 passing attempts, including seven straight incompletions to end the game.
  Florida’s defense held Bray to a 50 per-
cent completion rate after the junior made 74 percent of his passes without a single interception during Tennessee’s ﬁ  rst two games of the season.
  The pressure Florida put on Bray was 
too much for him to handle.  After record-ing only four quarterback hurries in their ﬁ  rst two games, the Gators notched seven against the Volunteers. 
McCray and Dominique Easley led UF 
with two hurries each. 
The seven hurries were the most the 
Gators have totaled in a single game since 
recording nine against Auburn on Oct. 15, 
2011.
  “They put a couple of new things to-
gether, it was almost too much to block,” Tennessee tailback Rajion Neal said. “It 
was almost like Tyler Bray had his own set 
blitz. They brought a lot and more than we could block at a time.”
