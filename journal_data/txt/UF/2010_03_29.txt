UPD cuts Slightly Stoopid concert short
0 ABOUT 12,000 PEOPLE
ATTENDEND.
By CRISTINA RABAZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Slightly Stoopid and G.
Love & Special Sauce concert was
cut short Saturday night at about 9
p.m., as the audience grew overly
aggressive and several people
were injured.
According to Aaron Crespin,
Student Government Production's
chairman, about 12,000 people at-
tended the concert at Flavet Field.
At one point during the show,
Slightly Stoopid's lead singer Miles
Doughty asked the crowd to calm
down in order to let EMTs carry an
injured man, who appeared to be
unconscious, out of the audience.
Crespin said about 11 people
were taken away in ambulances.
Another individual left the con-
cert after being punched in the face
and bleeding from his eye.
Several more students, either
injured, crowd surfing, or in pos-
session of or under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, were pulled
from the front of the crowd and es-corted out of the concert, as well.
"At first the crowd was calm,"
UF freshman Jessica Pariente said.
"But as the concert continued, the
crowd started to get really rough
and people just began pushing
each other around. That's when
people started getting hurt."
"At first the crowd was
calm, but as the concert
continued, the crowd start-
ed to get really rough."

EMTs and police officers con-
tinued to move into and out of
the audience to control the crowd
throughout the night. Authori-
ties warned the audience to settle
down.
Crespin said the University Po-
lice Department ended the show
early to prevent further injuries.
UPD would not comment on
the situation on Sunday.
"I don't think it could've been
prevented, but maybe if there were
more police present, it could have
helped the situation," Pariente
said.
Relay raises $114K

Andrew Ruiz remembers his moth-
er's battle with cancer.
Alongside 1,500 people who have
somehow been touched by cancer, Ruiz
helped raise $114,000 to donate to the
American Cancer Society during Relay
for Life at the O'Connell Center on Fri-
day and Saturday.
The money was raised from dona-
tions leading up to the event and dona-
tions made during it, Ruiz said.

More than 200 people
attend dog show
Every dog has its day, and
on Saturday, Taz pawed herway to the top for best in show
at the Fourth Annual Mutts and
Pups Dog Show.
More than 200 people and
about 100 dogs attended the all-
day event at James Paul Park in
High Springs, including Ellen
Powers and her Jack Russell ter-
rier, Taz.
The pair has been competing
and racking up the first place
finishes for about six years.
"We're a team and always
have been," said Powers, who
is from High Springs.
Taz completed a routine
filled with leaping, flipping and
dancing that also landed her in
first place for the best trick cat-
egory.
"The main focus is Taz,"
Powers said. "I just act like a
prop, and she knows what to
do."
Tina Prizament, event di-
rector, said this year's turnout
was better than ever, with more
than 50 dogs competing in 12
categories.
The Alachua County Hu-
mane Society was one of the
main sponsors for the event,
bringing six dogs to show for
adoption.
Three of the six dogs brought
by the the Humane Society were
adopted.
"Any time I can go back to
the shelter with less animals
than I brought out to an event
is a very good day," said Kirk
Eppenstein, director of the Hu-
mane Society.

Students adjust after shooting
Victim taught 177 students
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
When the students of GEA 1000,
Section 2238 returned from spring
break, they were supposed to learn
about climate change.
Instead, many of them learned
their teacher had been shot.
Nearly one month after 35-year-
old graduate student and teacher
Kofi Adu-Brempong was shot
and arrested, his former students
in GEA 1000, Geography for a
Changing World, are still adjust-
ing to the news.
"It was kind of a hard transition
after he left," said UF freshman
Jennifer Torres.
Torres did not know what had
happened to her teacher until UF
President Bernie Machen sent a
mass e-mail to all UF students ten
days later on March 12 explaining
the incident.
"I didn't believe it," Torres said
of the e-mail. "I was shocked."
Even though Adu-Brempong is
no longer teaching GEA 1000, the
class of 177 students has contin-
ued working through the syllabus
without him.
Graduate student Keith Year-
wood, who has replaced Adu-
Brempong, has taught the classbefore.
To make the transition as
smooth as possible, the original
syllabus, grading policies, class
material and office hours have
remained unchanged, Yearwood
said.
The two teachers have similar
teaching styles, Torres said. Both
have a humorous, eclectic quality,
she said.
Adu-Brempong and Yearwood
are good friends, Yearwood said,
as the two used to share a small of-
fice in the geography department.
"I didn't believe it. I was
shocked."
Jennifer Torres
UF freshman
"I used to kid him all the time,"
Yearwood said.
Yearwood has not been able to
visit his friend at Shands at UF, as
Adu-Brempong remains under the
custody of the Alachua County's
Department of the Jail.
About 10 students have written
get well cards to their bed-ridden
teacher, he said.
"The students are concerned
about their grades, but they're
also concerned about [Adu-Brem-pong,]" he said. "The Monday af-
ter spring break, there was stand-
ing-room only in here."
Nearly all 177 students crowd-
ed into Room 100 of Williamson
Hall that day to hear geography
department head Peter Waylen ex-
plain what had happened.
Many of the students expressed
anger that it took 10 days for UF
administration to explain what
was going on.
Even though he received an ex-
planatory e-mail from the depart-
ment of geography the morning
after the shooting, Yearwood was
also upset that UF took so long to
respond.
If former UF quarterback Tim
Tebow had been shot, Machen
would have released a statement
in less than 24 hours, he said.
The delay occurred because
investigators needed time to get a
feel for what happened before an
official statement was released,
Machen said in a phone interview.
An in-depth investigation is be-
ing conducted by the Florida De-
partment of Law Enforcement and
is not likely to finish before the end
of the semester.
Between now and the end of the
semester, Yearwood is scheduled
to talk about deserts, dams and
acts of God.
Whatever he teaches, Yearwood
tries to keep it light.

About 6,000 people 'march' 8.5 miles for babies
0 ORGANIZERS ESTIMATE THE
EVENT RAISED ABOUT $815,000.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
James Boudreau is alive.
The Buchholz High School senior was
born about a month early and escaped
with only allergies and asthma.
He was not one of the nearly 1.2 million
babies who die each year from being born
prematurely.
Boudreau was, however, one of nearly
6,000 participants in Saturday's March for
Babies, a fundraiser dedicated to giving
aid to the families of premature infants
and funding neonatal research.
"It was an outstanding showing of
people all throughout the commu-
nity."
Betsy Trent
executive director of the March of Dimes
North Central Florida division
Event organizers estimated that the
event raised about $815,000, although ex-
act figures will not be known for several
months, said Betsy Trent, the executive
director of the March of Dimes North Cen-
tral Florida division.
Participants in the 8.5-mile march,
which started and finished at Westwood
Middle School in northwest Gainesville,
were greeted by a throng of cheering vol-unteers who handed them stickers and of-
fered high fives.
While some participants finished in
less than an hour, some marchers took
more than four hours to walk all the way
around.
Upon finishing, some marchers iced
and rubbed down their legs, while otherscollapsed and took naps in the school yard
grass.
Although rain was expected for part of
the day, Trent said the marchers experi-
enced sunny skies throughout the morn-
ing, ideal weather for a high turnout.
"It was an outstanding showing of peo-
ple all throughout the community," she

Gainesville.said.
And it was this commitment throughout
the community that energized the march.
Joel Herron, who works for the Alachua
County Sheriff's Office, raised money by
purchasing $40 worth of sodas and selling
them at his office.
After two weeks of buying and selling
beverages and pizza, he had turned the
$40 into more than $400, all of which he
gave to the March of Dimes.
Overall, the Alachua County Sheriff's
Office raised about $3,000.
The top three fundraisers were Publix,
Walmart and Shands hospitals, respec-
tively.
The 12 Publix supermarkets in
Gainesville are projected to have raised
about $80,000 collectively, according to
Rob Chapman, the local Publix district
manager.
In the past six months, several
Gainesville high schools pooled their re-
sources together to raise about $61,000 for
the March of Dimes, Boudreau said.
The schools, collectively known as
Chain Reaction, were the fourth-highest
fundraisers.
"I'm walking for myself and all pre-
mature babies," said Boudreau, who has
worked for Chain Reaction for the past
two years.
"I don't want any parents to go through
what my parents went through."
The next local March for Babies will
take place on Nov. 14. It will be five miles
long and will begin at Turlington Hall.

Students showcase art
By VICTORIA ISRAELS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students from diverse backgrounds
showcased their artwork at the first Col-
ors of Hope: Art Exhibition on Friday.
About 70 guests visited the Institute
of Hispanic Latino Cultures building
from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. to view 19
pieces of art from 10 UF student artists
and to show support for diversity and
multiculturalism.
The displays featured oils, acrylics,
clay ceramics, chalk and colored pen-
cil drawings. Artists hailed from Cuba,
Venezuela, Colombia and the U.S.
Corey Brown, an anthropology se-
nior, focused his artwork on the lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender and queer
community. According to the event's
program, his artwork reflected his iden-
tity, his views on queer culture, and so-
ciety's views of the LBGTQ community.
Martha Calderon's three pieces were
inspired by negative stereotypes she ex-
perienced.
When Calderon moved from Colom-
bia to the U.S., she said people discrimi-
nated against her because of her Latinobackground.
"My artwork was inspired by the dis-
crimination I felt," Calderon said. "But
now with my future artwork, my inspi-
ration is the desire to share the richness
of my country and everything it has to
offer."
Melany Valderrama's pieces were
entitled "Oil and Water," "Calor del
Baile," and "and life goes on."
Valderrama's "and
life goes on" was a
person standing face
forward with a gray
umbrella while sever-
Br'ow"al other figures faced
backwards with differ-
ent colored umbrellas.
The figures were set in
a dark, rainy cit.
She said this piece symbolized her
transition to the more fast-paced Ameri-
can way of life.
The event was free and open the pub-
lic. It partnered with the Gainesville Art
Walk, which occurs on the last Friday
of every month and gives local artists
a chance to display and advertise their
work.Exhibit turns blind eye
to artistic conventions

Students didn't need their eyes to appre-
ciate the art at the 13th annual MindSight ex-
hibit Saturday.
For the 60-plus visitors at the Ham Mu-
seum of Art, the exhibit was a sensory expe-
rience, and guests had the option of navigat-
ing the museum blindfolded to "see" the art
through their other senses.
"It's called MindSight because it's a mind
game for people with sight," said Linda Di-
Franco, a featured artist who was the director
of MindSight before it was turned over to the
Gator Lions Club, an organization dedicated
to helping the blind community.
The exhibit featured about 30 pieces of art
and 13 plants.
Participants were able to listen to music,
touch and smell plants, and feel the pieces of
art.Both the blind and blindfolded were led
by student guides who described the plants
and art.
"It was an out-of-body experience be-
cause it's one of those experiences where
you're not relying on your usual senses,"
said Mary Velasco, a UF nursing freshman.
"What you would normally feel is height-
ened, and everything is more
On sensitive."Campus Joel Weiss, a physics junior
and president of the Gator Li-
ons Club, said that about 15 percent of the
participants were visually impaired.
For these guests, appreciating art with
senses beyond vision is an everyday reality.
"People who are blind pick up what's in
the picture much faster than the non-blind,"
said Elizabeth Hemandez, a student guide at
the exhibit. "I even had one lady earlier who
was blind say to me, 'I see what you mean,

Shame on Them
Church's smear tactics
cruel, indecentFirst, it was the disturbingly homophobic fliers accus-
ing Gainesville mayoral candidate Craig Lowe of being
"responsible for legally allowing men in women's rest-
rooms."
Then it was the shockingly hateful rant video from local fun-
damentalist fear-mongers, the Dove World Outreach Center, in
which the church's second-in-command delivered verbal blows
like "homo" and "fag."
We're wondering what's next in the line of attacks against
someone who could be our city's new mayor, and we're sick
of it.
Gainesville has a reputation not only for being LGBT friend-
ly, but as a generally welcoming place -where else could you
get away with jorts around educated people? But these attacks
are making us sick to our stomachs and ashamed to live in
Gainesville.
As you know from our endorsement, we support Lowe.
We respect what he's done for the city during his time as a
Gainesville commissioner, and we appreciate his work with the
equal opportunity council. But this isn't about politics, and it's
not about Lowe as a candidate.
It's about decency, something this election season's attack-
ers would do well to learn something about. Their statements
surpass ignorance and venture into idiocy.
Their word choices surpass insensitive and fly into cruelty.
It tarnishes Gainesville's reputation as a welcoming place and
makes us all look like bigots. The hate campaign has to stop,
and those who perpetuate it should be deeply ashamed.
IdolHands
I n the old days, grab- bing a fistful of altar boy
would get you a cop car
ride, a trial and a new girl-
friend named LaDarius.
Now, it gets you a job
transfer and closer to can-
onization.
With the sexual mindset
of NAMBLA, a public rela-
tions team more fitting for
O.J. Simpson and a knack for
cover-ups that would make
Jimmy Hoffa blush (a true
"holy trinity"), the Catholic
Church has ou done itself
with Touchy-Gate 2.0.
We could understand
your need to build your
lavish palace in Italy with
funds raised from guilt-
tripping illiterate towns-
folk. ("Give us thirty pieces
of silver and grandma gets
to leave purgatory and go
play shuffleboard with Je-
sus!")
We can momentarily
overlook your "expert"
medical opinion that AIDS-ridden Africa needs absti-
nence programs and a few
rosary beads instead of
more practical things such
as a protection and sexual
education regimen that isn't
routed in the Dark Ages.
But when your over-em-
bellished, over-publicized
king in Rome tells a country
with one of the richest Cath-
olic traditions in the world
"Cops, we did it again,"
something's not right.
Instead of giving boat-
loads of cash to the people
you used to give lollipops
and back rubs to, take some
steps that -you know -
aren't grounded in the dol-
drums of depressing Grego-
rian chants and antiquated
traditions. If it takes allow-
ing clergy to marry or cruci-
fying these criminals in St.
Peter's Square, do it.
But heaven help us if all
Father Happy Hands gets
is only a slap on the wrist
from the hand of God.

Current events bri
R arely is this question posed: Have I unknowingly
been in the hot tub time machine or has the past
week or so been a really wicked case of d6jA vu? I
have recently been asking myself this as a series of seem-
ingly long-exhausted events came to an incredibly startling
-OK, slightly entertaining -temporal intersection.
Most prominent in both the current public eye and the
foundation of my possible time warp conundrum, the Ro-
man Catholic Church has entered round two of its sex-abuse
scandal chronicles, the first instance of which rose to a na-
tional fervor here in the U.S. during the early part of the last
decade. Now the allegations have emerged in Europe, where
Pope Benedict XVI, the cardinal formerly known as J.Ratz,
has been implicated in a case in Germany, as well as in the
halting of the prosecution of a case from Milwaukee.
Demands of an apology and acknowledgement of respon-
sibility have been raised, along with a few assertions of resig-
nation, amid much speculation concerning the tarnishing of
his legacy. I suppose this means his options include his origi-
nal, colloquial reputation as "that nearly Nazi pope," his es-
tablished standing as "that whip-cracking pope," and newly-
revealed role as "that fondle-friendly pope." (Bonus points if
he goes for all three; I hear that's quite the often-strived-for,
seldom-achieved combo-fetish in his native Deutschland.)
Perhaps he should just pray for a swift onset of Parkinson's
disease so the church can allow his responsibility in the mat-
ter to be conveniently sidestepped and diminished, as was
done with his predecessor Pope JP II.
Another blast from the past reared its head last week in
Arizona. That's right, McPalin is back together. I was begin-
ning to long for the dumb-yet-spunky/ancient-thus-crotch-
ety dynamic that rocketed them all the way to an impressive
second place finish in the '08 election. At a rally for McCain's
re-election to the Senate, Palin pleaded with crowd, "for the
sake of our country," to support the elder senator. Of course,
her appeal would have been more effective had, say, a groupig sense of deja vu
of Palinites not shown up with T-
shirts, signs and, naturally, palms
#: branded with "Palin 2012." As if that
wasn'tattention-diverting enough, the
consensus quoted among her folksy-
focused supporters was approxi-

letters@alligatororglately, "I could care less about this
'John' character, I'm here for Sarah 
-
wooo!" Perhaps they were confused
about the nature of the event. Perhaps
she was confused about the nature of the event. Maybe they
all just went rogue (independently, of course).
Keeping this flashback train rolling, reminiscence of
Kanye West and Hurricane Katrina danced through my head
after seeing a video of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton visit-
ing Haiti. The clip shows the two former presidents shaking
hands with residents and survivors of the recent earthquake,
when a seemingly panic-stricken Bush suddenly and bla-
tantly wipes his hands all over Clinton's shirt sleeve after
finishing his greeting rounds. Bill gives his best WTF face as
the clip cuts away. Hilarity ensues, followed by a sobering
feeling that Kanye West was in fact on to something when he
stated, in a post-Katrina moment of agitation, "George Bush
doesn't care about black people."
Not only did this wipe channel Bush's alleged distaster-
triggered racial indifference, it also prompted memories of
the famed eyeglass wiping incident and, of course, his post-
Obama-shake hand-sani-spritz, all combining to form one
mind-bending cluster-nugget of coincidence I've come to ex-
pect only from "Lost." I'm just glad to see G-Dubs still stick-
ing to his guns. His unapologetic, PC-slaying guns. Way to
keep it classy.
All in all, I think it's appropriate to give a shoutout this
week to random resurfacing, fecund fortuitousness, histori-
cal happenstance -oh, and nicknames.

people the tools to reach those expectations.
If you may be speculating, I did receive the
full amount of Bright Futures with meeting

the program, but the people who make it into
an idealized even playground.
But if you truly feel that Bright Futures is
going to people who don't work hard enough
for it, or just don't deserve to compete with
you on that level because they are lazy, then
get rid of it and give the money to people that
could use it and need it.
Make it a need-based scholarship, then it
won't be an entitlement program for the mid-
dle class and beyond. It will give opportunity
to a wider range of people to go to college.
People who are amazingly intelligent and re-
sourceful, but perhaps didn't get that arbitrary
1290 but still deserve the opportunity.

Reform is constitutional
This letter is in response to Chelsea Fleck'sletter in Friday's Alligator. First, it's necessary
to correct her statement that the 10th Amend-
ment to the Constitution is the Commerce
Clause. While the 10th Amendment does re-
serve rights not specified in the Constitution
to the states, it is not the Commerce Clause.
The actual Commerce Clause is in Article
1 of the Constitution and gives Congress the
power to regulate commerce between multi-
ple states. However, Article 1 also gives Con-
gress the power to tax, which is what makes
her assertion that the law is unconstitutional
invalid. She argues that it's unconstitutional
for the federal government to require us to
purchase something, but that's not what's
happening.
No one is required to purchase health in-
surance. The law raises taxes slightly to help
fund reform. If someone purchases insurance,
he or she receives an exemption from that tax.
This is no different than when President Cart-
er gave tax credits to people who purchased
solar panels in the '70s, and the government's
right to grant tax exemptions has been upheld
by the Supreme Court. In the end, if someone
chooses not to purchase insurance and gets
sick or hurt, we already pay their bills through
rate hikes while the sick person pays nothing.
This law assures that those people will at
least pay something, which is why conserva-
tives introduced it in the '90s as an answer to
Clinton's proposal. I guess it's not conserva-
tive enough anymore.

Student Government president blows golden political moment
In the game of politics, Double J just rolled a double
zero.
Our esteemed commander in chief, who oversees the
disease-infested herd of Napoleonic complexes and pseudo-
politicians that is UF Student Government, received a politi-
cal present over a week ago in the form of an old-fashioned
police confrontation.
Instead of taking advantage of this gift from the govern-
ment gods, he pulled an R. Kelly and pissed all over it.
True politicians don't become great by passing stacks of
mind-numbing legislation or twisting syllables in stump
speeches. Instead, they write their legacies on the parcel of
Ponzi schemes and prostitution stings.
A disorderly conduct charge?
I would expect that out of a girl scout Canadian coun-
cilman, not an all-American politician with a million-dollar
face and a 20-cent soul.
All it takes to get a disorderly conduct charge is a bottle
of Jack Daniels, a creative imagination and an intense hatred

Program helps cancer patients look good, feel better
* IT PROVIDES WOMEN WITH A
FREE MAKEUP KIT.
By MEGAN MERRILL
Alligator Contributing Writer
Judy Kenne has been teaching women how
to put makeup on and face the day for the past
five years.
As a cosmetologist, Kenne volunteers with
Look Good, Feel Better, an American Cancer
Society program addressing appearance-
related side effects of radiation and chemo-therapy.
"I teach the class simply because of the
fact that I know what these ladies are going
through," Keene said. "They develop attitude
because they know they have to get up each
morning no matter how sick they feel. They
know their skin and everything about them is
going to change."
Kenne, 67, became licensed for the pro-
gram in 1997 when a friend was diagnosed
with bone cancer. She was diagnosed with
cervical cancer in 2000, underwent treatments
and began teaching in 2006.
The program provides the women with a"Many women care a lot about

free makeup kit, which contains disposable
tools for the women to use when applying
makeup, and shows the women how to main-
tain wigs and tie scarves and turbans if they
have experienced hair loss.
"Many women care a lot about their hair,
and when it falls out they become vulnerable,"Kenne said.
Margaret Shaw, the society's patient servic-
es representative for the area, said the women
need to use disposable tools to prevent skin
infection associated with cancer treatments.
The Look Good, Feel Better program
meets once a month at three different sites
in Gainesville: the Davis Cancer Center at
Shands Medical Plaza, the North Florida Re-
gional Medical Center and the American Can-
cer Society Winn-Dixie Hope Lodge.
The next session will be at the Davis Cancer

will offer loans directly
GRANTS, from page 1
crats president, said under
the current system, the gov-
ernment carried all the risk,
while all the profits went to
the banks.
Under the new legislation,
the government will no longer
act as a middleman. Instead,
the Department of Education
will offer loans directly to stu-
dents.
Cavataro said the new leg-
islation will ensure student
loans work for students and
not for banks.
UF College Republicans
Chairman Johnathan Lott said
he supports ending subsidies,
but is worried the federal gov-
ernment can't operate as well
as private banks.
No Republicans voted for
the legislation, and Sen. Lamar
Alexander, R-Tenn., a staunch
defender of the old govern-ment-subsidized loans, wrote
in a Washington Post op-ed,
"The Obama administration is
pushing for another Washing-
ton takeover -this time of the
student loan system."
But Democrats have said
the new reforms will save the
government money.
"This reform of the federal
student loan programs will
save taxpay-
National ers $68 billion
News over the next
decade," Presi-
dent Obama said. "And with
this legislation, we're putting
that money to use achieving a
goal I set for America. By the
end of this decade, we will
once again have the highest
proportion of college gradu-
ates in the world."
The new legislation also
caps annual student loan re-
payments at 10 percent of a
borrower's income.

Florida avoids sweeo with 13-1 rout of Ole Miss
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF third baseman Austin Maddox went 6 for 14 at the plate with six RBIs in the Gators' weekend series
against Ole Miss. The freshman hit a home run in UF's 13-1 win over the Rebels on Sunday.0 AUSTIN MADDOX HAD
THREE RBIs IN UF'S WIN.
ByANTHONYCHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achia ng@a IIigator org
The Gators enjoyed a little bit of a
role reversal on Sunday.
After being crushed by 12 runs
on Saturday, No. 2 Florida (18-5, 4-2
Southeastern Conference) bounced
back just one day later, routing No.
17 Ole Miss 13-1 and avoiding a se-
ries sweep.
"I know everybody was disap-
pointed about the game we had on
Saturday, but we had to put it be-
hind us," UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan
said. "You don't play well on a cer-
tain day, but the good thing about a
good team is that they put it behind
them, and that's what we did."
The Gators stranded 22 runners
on base in the first two games of
the series against the Rebels (19-6,
4-2 SEC), but that wasn't a problem
Sunday. UF only left five on the
basepaths in the final game of the
series and exploded for 15 hits after
only managing a combined 14 in the
two contests before that.
The one constant for Florida
throughout the weekend was third
baseman Austin Maddox, who went
6 for 14 in the series and knocked in
six runs.
He continued his success Sun-
day with a solo homer in the second
inning to give the Gators an earlylead and drove in another two with
a single in a three-run third inning
to bump it up to a 4-0 advantage for
UF.
That was all Florida pitcher Brian
Johnson would need. The freshman
gave up just one run in 5.1 innings of
work and only allowed one hit after
the second inning. He has limited
opponents to one earned run in his
last 11.2 innings pitched.
"I know everybody was
disappointed about the
game we had on Saturday,
but we had to put it behind,,us.
Kevin O'Sullivan
UF baseball coach
"We just got to control the
count, and if you control the count,
you generally control the inning,"
O'Sullivan said. "He (Johnson) gave
us a really good start and gave us a
chance to get the bats going."
UF continued the onslaught due
to some unlikely sources.
Left fielder DanielPigottsmashed
a two-run single to left field in the
fifth to finish with three RBIs on
the day, while right fielder Kamm
Washington drove in a run in the
seventh inning.
It didn't stop there.
With the game already out of
hand in the ninth, sophomore Jerico

UF GYMNASTICS
Gators claim seventh SEC title
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
JACKSONVILLE -The Southeastern
Conference Championships didn't start out
exactly how the Gators had hoped, but the
meet certainly ended the way they wanted it
to.
No. 4 Florida took home its seventh SEC
title in school history with a team total of
197.05, edging out defending conference
champion No. 1 Alabama (196.875) in Veter-
ans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville.
After receiving a bye in the first rotation,
Florida got off to a rough start on the vault,
registering a 49.125, the team's second-lowest
score of the season on the event.
But coach Rhonda Faehn said the Gators
didn't let the vault performance affect them.
After another bye and performing on theuneven bars, the Gators put together their
second-best beam total of the year to rally in
the second half of Saturday's meet.
But it wasn't without drama.
On beam, senior Courtney Gladys led off
for UF with a 9.9 to set the
tone.
After solid routines by
Amy Ferguson, Randy
Stageberg and Rebekah
Zaiser, freshman Liz Green,
who won four beam titles
this season, fell twice during
Gladys her routine.
Florida needed SEC Freshman of the Year
Ashan6e Dickerson to come through big like
she has all season. And that's just what she
did.
"I looked into her eyes, and I could see she

pring practice is a minefieldof useless information.
Maybe you like it; I usually
don't. No matter your preference,
history shows there are a lot of things
you think you "learn" in spring that
prove to be completely false come
two-a-days in the fall.
Notice I didn't say spring practice
is completely useless. For Florida
fans, spring practice is a chance to
get a look behind the curtain. The
Gators typically only have a handful
of open practices in the fall, but you
can see every spring practice.
For coaches and players, spring-
time is key for player development.
Spring is most important for depth
purposes -guys are fighting forsecond- and

The rea-
sons for this
are many; injuries and the absence of
some freshmen are just a few. So far
this spring, senior Duke Lemmens
has gotten a lot of first-team reps at

Performing in her hometown,
Dickerson scored a 9.925 on the

Following the beam, Florida

while Alabama closed out its
meet on the floor.
The Crimson Tide finished

the scoreboard.

But Alabama had to play the
waiting game while Florida fin-

Green led off for UF on floor
exercise and rebounded after her
falls on the beam with a 9.875.
The Gators carried that mo-
mentum to their first SEC title
since 2007, as the team counted
four 9.875s on floor and a 9.9
from senior Maranda Smith.
Faehn called the team's floor
performance one of its best all
season.
"It's going to give our athletes

Faehn said of the team's rally.
"Under the heavy-pressure situ-

UF freshman Ashan6e Dickerson continued her dominant first sea-
son at the SEC Championships on Saturday in Jacksonville. Her
9.925 score on the balance beam put the Gators in the lead for
good, as they won the meet with a total score of 197.05.

-perhaps as tall as 6-foot-4 Ronald
Powell, Rivals.com's top recruit who
will arrive in Gainesville in August.
There is no guarantee Powell or
fellow end recruit Lynden Trail will
win the starting gig, but because
many called this year's defensive re-
cruiting class one of the best ever, I
give them a fighting chance.
The bottom line is we just don't
know. Spring football cannot settle
these issues.
I'll tell you one thing spring foot-
ball has cemented in my brain.
John Brantley is 100 times more
valuable to the 2010 team than Tim
Tebow was to the 2009 Gators.
This statement is no slight of
Tebow, nor is it a crowning of Brant-
ley as the best player in college foot-
ball.
I make that evaluation because of
the disparity between Brantley and
his current backup, Trey Burton.
I've got nothing against Burton, but
the Rivals.com three-star recruit has
looked bad in spring practice so far.

Deadlines vary
GODuring the Tebow years, the
joke was always that Brantley, UF's
backup, could start for many other
top-25 or Southeastern Conference
teams. I doubt that kind of rhetoric
will be used for Burton.
I think his future has been laid
out by a four-star quarterback re-
cruit from the 2009 class: Jordan
Reed. It became apparent even last
fall that Reed was destined to switch
to tight end or receiver. Voila, now
he's at tight end and is probably one
of the two best on the Gators' roster.
And while Tyler Murphy won't
arrive until fall, everything I heard is
the Rivals.com two-star recruit will
probably have a similar shift to tight
end or receiver in his future.
I'm telling you, Gators fans, if
you were worried about Tebow
going down, you should be much
more worried about Brantley getting
hurt. (Remember: for all the running
Tebow did, the biggest hit he took
came in the pocket.)
Burton or Murphy taking mean-
ingful snaps this fall is a recipe for
disaster, just like believing every-
thing you see or hear this spring.

UF MEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Gators fifth at NCAAs
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
For the second-straight year, the
Florida men's swimming and diving
team placed fifth in the nation. But one
Gator left on top.
The Gators finished the NCAA
Swimming and Diving Championships
in Columbus, Ohio, with 364 points,
UF's most ever in a national champion-
ship meet, and junior Conor Dwyer was
crowned Division I National Swimmer
of the Year.
Texas won the team championship
with 500 points, followed by Califor-
nia (469.5), Arizona (387) and Stanford
(369).
"We're really proud of the way the
guys finished the meet this weekend,"
coach Gregg Troy said. "We raced
tough the whole way through to the
very last relay.
"We didn't have as many bodies this
year, but to come out and accumulate
the most points ever for a Florida team
in an NCAA meet is really an accom-
plishment."
Dwyer picked up national honors af-
ter becoming the first men's swimmer
since 2001 to win both the 200- and 500-
yard freestyle races in the same meet.
"Conor was very deserving of Na-
tional Men's Swimmer of the Year, but
[Shaune Fraser] also had a fantastic
meet, finishing second in two races and
first in the other, while all were ma-jor contributors in each of our relays,"
Troy said.
"Our seniors have contributed four
great years here at Florida, and even
though we were a little short tonight,
our entire coaching staff is very happy
with the way they performed the whole
way through."
Swimming for the last time as a
Gator, Fraser ended his collegiate ca-
reer as a 27-time All-American, passing
Carlos Jayme (26) and Ryan Lochte (24)
for most in school history.
Fraser's attempt to defend his title in
the 200-yard butterfly
seemed to fall short, as
Georgia's Mark Dylla
edged Fraser's time of
1:41.45.
But a two-handed
touch disqualified
Dylla and resulted in
Fraser reclaiming the
title.
"You have to feel bad for Dylla,"
Fraser said. "He won the race and he's
a great competitor, we swim (against)
each other in the SEC each season. On
the other hand, with the disqualifica-
tion situation, the points went towards
Florida and that boosted us."
Eleven Gators swam a total of 38 All-
America performances, breaking two
Florida records in the process.
Dwyer, Shaune Fraser and junior
Brett Fraser each had seven All-Amer-
ica honors.Brooks breaks out of

0 THE GATORS TOOK TWO OF
THREE FROM NO. 5 ALABAMA.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
For Florida and Alabama, March Mad-
ness applies to more than just basketball.
"This is how every one of our games
has gone with them," UF coach Tim Wal-
ton said. "We've never once had a com-
fortable lead in three years of playing
these guys."
After a pair of wild, come-from-be-
hind wins led to a doubleheader split
Saturday, it should come as no surprise
that Sunday's finale was a back-and-
forth affair.
When all was said and done, senior
Corrie Brooks played the role of unlikely
hero as the No. 6 Gators (23-4, 6-2 South-
eastern Conference) earned an 11-9 vic-
tory to take series with the No. 5 Crimson
Tide (24-9, 7-4 SEC) in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Despite entering Sunday's game 0 for
her last 19 at-bats and with only one home
run and seven RBIs this year, Brooks car-
ried the load offensively for UF.
She got the Gators their first lead of
the game with a third-inning grand slam,then hit a solo shot to lead off the seventh
that broke a 9-9 tie and scored the even-
tual game-winning run.
"It's something I really needed since I
pretty much had zero confidence in my-
self," Brooks said. "I tried to do the best
that I could and got that confidence back
with two big hits."
With the Gators leading 9-5 in the
bottom of the sixth, UF
ace Stephanie Brombach-
er gave up back-to-back
doubles that cut the leadSoftball to 9-6.
One out and a walk lat-
er, Brombacher was pulled
in favor of freshman Ensley Gammel,
who gave up a home run to the first bat-
ter she faced, tying the game at nine.
"I was a little mad at myself but [fresh-
man catcher Brittany Schuttel came out
there and told me not to worry about it,"
Gammel said. "I just thought that if I got
these next two outs I'd be good to go."
Sure enough, Gammel got the next
two outs in order, and after Brooks and
freshman Samantha Holle earned UF
the lead with back-to-back home runs to
start the seventh, Gammel returned to
the circle and closed out the game.
