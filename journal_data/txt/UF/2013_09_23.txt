Jeff Driskel’s disappointing Sep-

for the No. 19 Gators on Saturday.After muddling through a three-
turnover performance in a loss to Miami on Sept. 7, Driskel suffered a season-ending fractured right ﬁ  bula during the ﬁ  rst quarter of Florida’s (2-1) 31-17 victory against Tennessee (2-2) in front of a crowd of 90,074 in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.

University Police arrested a UF College of Vet-
erinary Medicine professor Friday afternoon after 
he reportedly used a video camera disguised as a pen to view and record students’ bodies.
Don A. Samuelson, 65, was arrested on charg-
es of video voyeurism, according to a University Police report.  
Samuelson has been on administrative leave 
since a Sept. 6 search of his ofﬁ  ce, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes. 
Because the investigation is still ongoing, she 
could not speak about further consequences for Samuelson. However, she said “in a case with these kinds of serious allegations, we would pur-sue termination.”
The arrest report described four incidences in 
which Samuelson used the video pen. In the ﬁ  rst two — which happened in mid-April — he used it to ﬁ  lm the area between a student’s chest and his or her V-neck shirt.
During the third incident 
in early June, Samuelson used the device to ﬁ  lm a part of a student’s chest normally cov-ered by a shirt. In late August, Samuelson used the pen to ﬁ  lm in between a student’s thighs, according to the report.
The camera pen, as well as a 
USB drive with several videos 
from the pen, were recovered during a search of Samuelson’s ofﬁ  ce on Sept. 6, according to the re-port. 
During questioning after the search, Samuel-
son told police the pen belonged to him. He also admitted to ﬁ  lming one of the students and said UF prof arrested for ﬁ  lming studentsFLORIDA 31 TENNESSEE 17

After a summer of construction, Tutoring Zone has unveiled 
a new website and a new location.
The local tutoring company has moved to 1117 W. Univer-
sity Ave., about a six-minute walk from campus. The new loca-
tion is much smaller than the original, said Matthew Hintze, Tutoring Zone founder. 
“Back in the days when all of our reviews were live we 
needed a big, big place with lots of parking,” he said, “Because everybody had to actually physically attend the review.”
But now, with about 90 percent of students choosing to 
view the reviews online, Hintze said the huge building isn’t necessary. The new location allowed the tutoring company to rethink how it does business.
Hintze said the new location has led to higher attendance 
for live lectures, namely among the classes most frequently taken by younger students. He said older students mostly tend to watch the lectures online. 
Dylan Attal, a 21-year-old Spanish and linguistics junior, 
said the new location and website makes studying easier.
“That sounds like a good plan,” he said. “If they make it 
more convenient for students, it’s more likely that students will use their service.”Tutoring Zone moves closer to campus in a smaller space 
The renovated, expanded Reitz Union should debut in Fall 2015
that will provide space for student services and organizations. 
“It is truly the students who spearheaded 
this renewal and recreation,” Machen said.
The renovation will involve beautifying the 
union, adding new windows and increasing the energy efficiency of the building.
The renovated union will also have new of-
fices for Student Government, student organi-zations and clubs.
Student Body President Bonarrigo spoke 
about the need for an expanded union to keep pace with student population growth.
UF had about 19,000 students when the 
Reitz Union opened in 1967. It currently has about 50,000, she said.
“Today’s groundbreaking ceremony is the 
culmination of nearly a decade of work and ef-fort,” she said.
The renovated union will become a central 
hub for students, Bonarrigo said. 
It will include several student services, in-
cluding the Center for Leadership and Service, the Office of Multicultural & Diversity Affairs and GatorWell Health Promotion Services. 
Rep. McKeel also spoke at the groundbreak-
ing about his work with UF to make it a top university in the nation.
“I couldn’t be more excited, if you can’t tell, 
to be a Florida Gator,” McKeel said, “but I also couldn’t be more excited to be a member of a legislature who understands the importance of higher education.”
Machen awarded McKeel with the Presi-
dent’s Medallion for his service to the univer-sity.
About 200 people attended the event. Guests included state representatives, 12 
former student body presidents and members from the UF Board of Trustees.
Machen said expanding the Reitz Union is 
essential for UF to continue to provide a unique educational experience to students.
“We may only have some shovels and some 
sand here today to work with,” he said, “but today we’re going to begin again a renewal and a recreation of the University of Florida’s cathedral for our students.”

Gainesville Regional Airport re-
cently received a series of U.S. De-
partment of Transportation grants totaling more than $4 million. 
The grants are intended to fund upgrades to the airport taxiway and a new connector lane for planes.
Once completed, the additions 
will contribute to the overall security of the airport while also enhancing the airport’s aesthetics, said Laura Aguiar, an airport spokeswoman. 
The proposed connector lane will eliminate the pos-
sibility of a plane accidentally en-tering a runway in use, Aguiar said.
The duration 
of the project has not yet been determined, but 
construction could begin as early as November. Administration will en-sure all heavy construction is com-pleted overnight so that flights will not be interrupted during the pro-cess, Aguiar said.
In addition to the developments, 
lighting and signage around the air-port will be replaced alongside im-provements to the parking lot and the general aviation terminal.
Erin Schoch, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore who routinely flies out of the airport, said she thinks the funds for renovations will be well spent.
“It’s definitely a good use of pub-
lic money,” she said. 
Most recently, the airport up-
graded a service road and the main entrance road. 
The airport offers both national 
and international flights from vari-ous airline carriers to destinations ranging from Miami and New York to Paris.

Chompmenus.com released an 
app for iPhone and Android users last 
week that allows Gainesville residents to order from their phone. 
“Over the past two years there’s 
been an increasing trend through mo-bile devices,” said Andrea Garcia, the regional marketing director for www.Chompmenus.com. “We wanted to spend time developing an application that would benefit those users.”
Alicia Newton, a 24-year-old Santa 
Fe political science sophomore, said the app makes ordering more conve-nient.“I think it’s going to create a lot more 
business if people have that resource at their fingertips,” Newton said.
Michael Garcia, a 22-year-old UF 
architecture graduate student, said it could create competition with other food delivery services like Gainesvil-le2Go.
But Jackson Bodiford disagrees.Bodiford, a manager at Gainesvil-
le2Go, said it’s more efficient than its  competition. 
“We do all the steps other than 
cooking the food,” Bodiford said.
Bodiford said that www.Chomp-
menus.com is not always up to date.
“We tried their service once,” said 
Bodiford. “We ordered from a restau-rant that was still on their website but that closed down a while ago. An hour later we got a call saying there was no response from the restaurant.”Chomp Menus releases appSamuelson’s classes will be covered
he was doing so to prove that he or she wasn’t wearing undergarments. He admitted his ac-tions were “inappropriate,” according to the report.
Second-year veterinary student Casey Silje-
strom said she was shocked by the allegations. She took histology — a class required of all first-year vet students — with Samuelson last year.
“We always just thought he was a really nice 
guy, a little bit boring but never threatening in any way,” the 23-year-old said. “I never felt un-
comfortable around him.”
College of Veterinary Medicine Dean James 
Lloyd sent out an email reassuring students, 
faculty and staff that Samuelson’s classes will be covered temporarily and the college is work-ing to transition any student projects previously under Samuelson’s supervision. The email also said the college is offering counseling and aca-demic advising to students in need.
“We are working to support anyone in our 
community affected by this situation, and in the coming days we will reach out to many of you to try to answer your questions and offer coun-seling and other resources,” the email read.
After about two weeks of sifting through 
evidence and conducting interviews, officers ar-rested Samuelson at his home Friday, said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
Barber said one student came forward with 
the allegations, but detectives are still investi-gating to determine how many victims were involved.  
Officers booked Samuelson into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 4:30 p.m. Friday. He was released later that evening after meeting bond.
UF professors arrested in the past include an 
anthropology professor who was jailed in 2009 after he admitted to trying to trade cocaine for sexual favors from another man, according to Alligator archives. Later that year, a department of pathology professor was arrested on charges of sexual assault, stalking, unarmed burglary and burglary with assault or battery. 
In the case of Samuelson, first-year veteri-
nary student Rebecca Seiden, 22, said the inci-dent was unfortunate. 
“However, it doesn’t reflect on the school as 
a whole whatsoever,” she said.prOfeSSOr , from page 1“If they make it more convenient for students,

In a response to Scott’s punishment, Sigma Nu said that the dean was leading a fraternity “witch hunt” and called for due process.  
Sept. 26 1994UF students were tired

Lake Wauburg saw a step-down 
and a breakdown at the UF Board of 
Trustees retreat Thursday and Fri-day.
The step-down came when Pres-
ident Bernie Machen announced Win Phillips, UF’s vice president of research and chief operating officer, will leave his position in December.
Phillips has spent more than 20 
years at UF, serving in roles like Col-lege of Engineering dean and vice president for research. His wife, Bet-ty, is due to start work as the execu-tive director of UF Online (formerly known as eCampus) on Jan. 1.
Phillips said a university is made 
up of its students, and it is the fac-ulty’s job to enrich their education. He will stay at UF as a professor of mechanical and biomedical engi-neering. 
“I started out of as a professor, 
I’m going to end as a professor,” Phillips said.
Trustees also saw a numerical 
breakdown of the expected results from UF Online. 
UF Provost Joe Glover said in 10 
years, the program hopes to have about 24,100 students. By Fall 2018, UF Online wants to offer 30 fully online degree programs. Five new degrees will be added each year, Glover said. 
“This is aspirational, but it’s goal-
setting, also,” said Associate Provost for Teaching and Technology Andy McCollough.
UF Online will start with busi-
ness administration, sports manage-ment, criminology and law, health education and environmental man-agement.
The next year, it will add biology, 
mechanical engineering, psychol-ogy, telecommunications and nurs-ing, according to a draft of the com-prehensive business plan presented to the legislative task force Aug. 30. Other degrees to be added include chemistry, economics and political science.
UF Online applicants, Glover re-
minded the board, will be subjected to the same admissions standards as regular students.
Still, Glover made it clear the 
purpose of the program is not for UF Online students to transition to campus.
“When you reach the 24,000 stu-
dents, you do not want them all de -
scending on Gainesville,” he said.

Gainesville Police arrested a former U.S. Marine 
Corps captain after they say he fired a shotgun and 
was found with an arsenal of other guns at a South-west Gainesville apartment complex.
Police arrested Robert Anthony Brooks II, 31, on 
charges of aggravated assault, improper exhibit of a firearm and breach of the peace, according to a GPD arrest report.
Officers responded to Brooks’ apartment com-
plex, Ridgemar Commons — located at 3611 SW 34th St. — after reports that a shot was fired and that a man was sitting on top of a truck in a park-ing lot with an assault weapon, according to the report.
When officers arrived, they saw Brooks sitting 
on top of a white pickup truck arguing with a wom-an. He then jumped off the top of the truck onto the ground, wrote GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email. Before Brooks could take cover under his car, officers intervened and arrested him.
At that time, Brooks had two .45-caliber hand-
guns in his waistband as well as a shoulder holster with extra magazines, Tobias wrote. Officers also found a .12-gauge shotgun and an AR-15 on top of the truck.
After talking to witnesses, 
officers gathered that Brooks had a past relationship with the woman he was originally seen arguing with, Tobias said. Wit-nesses said that earlier in the day, Brooks saw the woman and her daughter in a car with two other men from the neighborhood.
The carload left the complex 
to get yogurt, during which Brooks went into his apartment to gather his guns, Tobias said. When they came back, Brooks walked toward the car pointing the shotgun, which Brooks told police ac-cidentally discharged.
Brooks also told police that his emotional issues 
stem from an “other-than-honorable” discharge from the U.S. Marine Corp — the result of a Decem-ber aggravated assault arrest, Tobias said.
Officers booked Brooks into the Alachua County 
Jail at about 1 a.m. Saturday, where he remained Sunday night with a $150,000 bond.Man shoots out of pickup truck,

The U.S. is on track for docu-
menting the highest number of 
measles cases in two decades, and vaccinations for the virus are down locally. 
According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, 159 cases have been recorded across the country so far.
Alachua County has a lower 
rate of vaccinations for the virus compared to the rest of the state, said Vini Vijayan, assistant pro-fessor at UF in the division of pe-diatric infectious diseases. 
“The rates of vaccination are 
declining, and more and more people are traveling abroad,” Vi-jayan said. “They’re bringing the disease back to the U.S. and are infecting people that aren’t vac-cinated.”
An average of 60 measles cases 
were reported in the U.S. annu-ally since 2000. 
An estimated 20 million cases 
of measles appear worldwide each year. 
Of all the infectious diseases, 
measles is most easily spread, Vi-jayan said. It spreads through the air by 
breathing, coughing, sneezing and direct contact with the infec-tious particles.
“Even in children that are 
healthy, you can get sick enough to require hospitalization,” Vi-jayan said. “It can lead to ear infections, seizures, pneumonia and death.”
To combat the infection, she 
said, college students need an MMR vaccine, which vaccinates against measles, mumps and ru-bella. 
If students were already vac-
cinated with MMR as children, they can choose to get a titer shot, which boosts the immune system back up to fight the measles in-fection.
Meriam Holder, an Alachua 
County resident who works as a nurse in Williston public schools, said this season may have seen an increase in measles because more parents are choosing not to vac-cinate their children.
Cecily Sandlin, a 21-year-old 
Santa Fe College nursing fresh-man, said she thinks the reason parents still choose not to vacci-nate their children is due to fear of exposing them to other disor-ders.
Measles nears record high for 2013, vaccine rates are downBrooks
In the virus form of measles, 
symptoms include:
• fever
• cough• runny nose• red eyes• red rashThe virus can turn into the 
disease form of measles, which 
can include:
• pneumonia• seizures• diarrhea • possible death“I started out of as a

Union Colonnade demolished?Photojournalists preserve dignity of death 
A journalist’s job is to seek truth. Sometimes, that 
truth can be uncomfortable or shocking. In trag-ic events like Saturday’s shooting in Nairobi, 
Kenya, reality is simply horrifying. 
Somali terrorist group al Shabaab stormed an up-
scale shopping mall and shot at civilians ranging from ages 2 to 78. 
The New York Times staff photographer Tyler Hicks 
was nearby when the terrorists attacked. He was able to enter the mall with police forces and photograph the chaos. Kenyan security forces evacuated more than a thousand people, but on Sunday, the gunmen held dozens hostage. The death toll by Sunday night after a military siege was 68, though many more were injured in the attack. 
Hick’s photographs were published Saturday on the 
New York Times website and printed in Sunday’s pa-per. The Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer has cap-tured moments of violence around the world — from the war in Afghanistan to volatile areas of Pakistan. 
On Saturday, he and his wife were off duty. But 
when hell broke loose, he was right in the middle, be-cause that’s the way of the trade. 
The pictures he shot are a testament to his talent and 
sensitivity as a photojournalist. Documenting poignant moments in the worst scenarios is what he does best, and he shouldn’t be criticized for it — he should be lauded. 
However, the images that were published by The 
New York Times have spurred outrage among readers, fellow journalists and academics. Some say Hicks ex-celled as a journalist when he embedded himself with police and exposed himself to danger on Saturday. 
However, they frown at the decisions made back at 
the desk. Should the editors of The New York Times, a beacon of American journalism, have picked out these photos more carefully? On Saturday, the families 
and friends of people who died at Westgate Mall would have been able to see their loved ones, fully recognizable, on the homepage of the Times. 
Michael Deibert, a journalist 
who has covered conﬂ  ict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
Haiti and Mexico, is no stranger to death or violence. He was disturbed by the Times’ editorial decision and hint-ed that American journalism has adopted a double stan-dard for when we do or don’t show graphic images. 
An excerpt from his letter to the public editor of the 
New York Times, published on his blog:
“Quite honestly, as a journalist who has reported on 
conﬂ  ict for going on 14 years, I was shocked and dis-mayed by this. Would The New York Times run photos of blood-soaked dead white Americans after one of the many mass shootings that occur in the United States? I doubt it.”
American media publishes and circulates graphic 
images, but does our sensitivity change according to the proximity of horror? 
Journalists learn that respect for the deceased and 
their families is paramount when telling a story. But in light of the editorial decisions of The New York Times, I can’t help but feel that dignity has been overlooked.
I can’t say that The New York Times was wrong to 
publish the pictures, but as a reader, I struggle to come to terms with the emotional factor of this choice. 
Bad things shouldn’t be sanitized, but there is a line 
that when crossed is simply bad taste. As an aspiring journalist, I see this decision as a portrait of the industry today — and what’s to come in the future.

porno mag: 
Publisher bankrupt
These days, dirty magazines — like VHS and cassette tapes, 
ﬂ  ip phones and the Walkman — have become relics of yore. The Internet, for better or for worse, quickly phased 
out the need for clunky adult DVDs and magazines.
Unlike vinyl LPs, for instance, pornographic magazines 
like Penthouse and Playboy don’t have a cool, vintage appeal. Anyone with Wi-Fi access can view millions of images of mil-lions of different nude bodies in an instant, reducing the need for an old-fashioned physical magazine. Owning nudie maga-zines presents its own set of logistical difﬁ  culties, anyway: They only support one-time use, and it’s near impossible to hide them from nosy roommates or signiﬁ  cant others. We watched MTV’s “Room Raiders” every day after school just like you did, and we know that all the good stuff is hidden under the mattress.
Smartphones have made it easy to satisfy our taboo fascina-
tions. With a few swipes of an index ﬁ  nger, anyone can — for the most part — wipe away his or her digital footprints from sketchy websites. So why bother with magazines at all?
This declining demand for physical porn manifested itself 
last week when FriendFinder Networks, the publisher of Pent-house magazine and owner of various adult entertainment web-sites, ﬁ  led for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The magazine has been suffering from ﬁ  nancial difﬁ  culties since 2003, so ﬁ  ling for bankruptcy protection seems like a stupidly optimistic move on CEO Anthony Previte’s part.
According to www.philly.com, Previte said bankruptcy will 
allow the company to reduce interest expenses, eliminate debt and strengthen its ﬂ  agship brands. 
The United States bankruptcy code stipulates that individu-
als or businesses that apply for Chapter 11 bankruptcy must prove that, with proper restructuring of assets, the individual or business can stabilize and become proﬁ  table again.
According to Reuters, the company’s social-networking sites 
have taken the hardest hit. FriendFinder, in addition to publish-ing “Penthouse,” hosts www.adultfriendﬁ  nder.com, which pro-motes casual hook-ups, and www.bigchurch.com, which adver-tises spiritual connections. Hopping on the social-networking train a la Facebook and LinkedIn has proven to be unsuccessful for company, and it’s not difﬁ  cult to see why.
After all, who constitutes FriendFinder’s market? Younger 
people — college students, young professionals and anyone who falls under the dubious “millennials” umbrella — rely on newer, less skeezy free dating websites such as OkCupid that make use of matrices to match users based on personality traits. On the other end of the scale, older online daters who are in-terested in a deeper connection typically use more credible, fee-charging dating sites like Match.com and eHarmony. 
Besides, who meets anyone on chat rooms anymore? Chat 
rooms, as Dateline’s “To Catch a Predator” has proven, are full of weirdos, creeps and police decoys posing as 12-year-old girls.
So are we surprised that FriendFinder has tanked? Not really. If anything, we’re just surprised they lasted this long.

Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote an open 
letter to customers earlier this week requesting gun owners not bring their ﬁ  rearms when they 
pick up their morning latte. 
This does not affect our campus Starbucks, as 
Florida statutes explicitly prohibit concealed weapon permit holders from carrying their gun on campus in addition to a short list of other locations, such as courthouses and grade schools. 
However, many college students enjoy practicing 
their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms off-campus, and many have taken the extra steps to become licensed to carry a concealed weapon. 
These individuals undergo ﬁ  rearms training, a 
marksmanship evaluation, ﬁ  ngerprinting and a na-tional background check. 
There are even groups for gun-toting students, 
such as Students for Concealed Carry, which cur-rently has more than 29,000 likes on Facebook. 
The numbers of concealed-carry permit holders 
in Florida are even more impressive — according to an August 2013 report by the Florida Department of Agriculture, there are nearly 1,340,000 active permits in the state. 
Many of those permit holders enjoy chugging their 
daily cup of joe, and odds are that you’ve probably been next to them in line at some point. 
In the past, Starbucks held a neutral position on 
ﬁ  rearms by stating that all customers were welcome as long as the applicable law was observed. 
A few “Starbucks Appreciation Day” events were 
organized with groups of ﬁ  rearm enthusiasts buying coffee to show their support of the company’s policies — policies that merely reﬂ  ect the law, as expected. 
Recently, however, Starbucks decided these ap-
preciation events had gone too far by making some customers feel uncomfortable. 
Schultz stated, “Today we are respectfully re-
questing that customers no longer bring ﬁ  rearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas — even in states where ‘open carry’ is permitted — unless they are au-thorized law enforcement personnel.” 
Schultz is asking law-abiding, licensed concealed 
carry permit holders to leave their rights at the door.   
To establish a bit of perspective on his request, 
imagine you walk into your local grocery store wear-ing a symbol that reﬂ  ects one of your basic rights as provid-ed in the Constitution.  
Perhaps you wear a burka, 
a cross or a rainbow-colored shirt. 
These symbols are outward reﬂ  ections of our basic 
rights of freedom to practice a religion, equality and free speech to display our opinions for others to see and discuss. 
Then imagine the store manager asks you to leave 
the item that so beautifully expresses your deep ap-preciation of your right simply because it might of-fend another customer. 
It might make someone who is unfamiliar with 
that right feel uncomfortable. 
The idea seems ridiculous, and rightfully so, be-
cause those rights are expressly given to all Ameri-cans by the Constitution, and no one should ask us to abandon them. 
Included among those basic rights is the right to 
keep and bear arms, and Starbucks has made it clear it would prefer you abandon that right when you en-ter its stores. 
However, anyone can bring a ﬁ  rearm into a public 
place without others being aware, and only conscien-tious ﬁ  rearm owners will stop to ponder Starbucks’ request. 
Would you rather be standing in line next to some-
one who has lawfully been registered with the state — or some off-the-street thug who doesn’t care about obeying the law? 
No matter their position on ﬁ  rearm control, stu-
dents should be cognizant that complacency with Starbucks’ new policy will set a dangerous precedent for individual liberties. 
While gun owners’ rights are being trampled to-
day, another group may be asked to refrain from its rights tomorrow. 
I ﬁ  rmly believe no one should be asked to leave his 
or her rights at the door, no matter how deliciously caffeinated the coffee may be. 
As for me, I am quite conﬁ  dent in my decision to 
take my business elsewhere and can not continue to support a company that has put discriminatory poli-tics above my freedom and liberty.

Speaking OutLast week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives voted to cut nearly $40 billion from the country’s food stamps programs. It was a huge slap in the face to 
millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet and put food on the table. Fortunately, the bill will die a quick death in the Democrat-controlled Senate. 
Yet again, the GOP is proving 
especially inept at solving our na-tion’s problems and instead places the blame on the nation’s most vul-nerable citizens. It’s an unfortunate situation where many Republicans fully believe that we can simply cut our way out of the country’s ﬁ  scal mess and be done with it. 
Sadly they’re wrong, and the 
recommendations they make could be downright dangerous. In the right circumstances, danger can be a lot of fun, so today, we’re going to play a little game called “Let the GOP Do It!”
The basic premise of this game is that, despite having a 
Democratic majority in the Senate and a Democrat in the White House, the two sides should agree to let all the crazy coming out of the House pass both factions and ultimately be signed into law by President Barack Obama. 
It might sound insane, but it’s truly the only way to prove 
just how bad much of the GOP-led legislation is for the coun-try and our citizens.
Because the Republicans voted more than 40 times to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act — or Obamacare — let’s go ahead and get rid of that and go back to letting insurance companies drop people’s coverage for preexisting condi-tions, placing lifetime caps on premiums and provide no affordable insurance to those not receiving employer-based coverage.
Oh, and if we can’t repeal Obamacare, we should deﬁ  -
nitely tie its repeal to the debt ceiling and funding of the gov-ernment. Who cares if the U.S. defaults on its debt or that the entire federal government could simply shut down? We’re doing this in the name of freedom!
Let’s not stop there. What else should we cut?We should pass bills that roll back the Dodd-Frank ﬁ  nan-
cial reforms and all other forms of Wall Street regulations Re-publicans deem harmful to the pure form of capitalism they want for the country. Also, all environmental regulations the GOP wants repealed should happen as well. 
Honestly, who actually wants bankers to play fair or have 
clean water to drink?
Not this guy!We also need to ensure that draconian cuts be made to 
almost every federal agency and public school. Your child’s education is not my problem, so why should I pay for it? 
Let’s make sure we obliterate social programs like Social 
Security and any type of welfare. Folks living off their So-cial Security or welfare checks are nothing more than fat cats sucking at the teat of the federal government.
Oh, but we can’t make any cuts to our military. Like, at 
all.
The reason I want this to happen isn’t because I’m a sadist 
who gets pleasure from seeing our great nation decline in the hands of radical conservatives in the U.S. House. It’s because we need to see that the path they want to take isn’t going to lead the country anywhere but down the drain. 
Deep cuts to our social programs will neither lift millions 
out of poverty nor lead to a libertarian revolution in which Ayn Rand’s greatest dreams come true. In fact, it’s putting these frightening policies into practice that might actually convince Americans a large swath of our elected ofﬁ  cials don’t actually have their best interest at heart. 
It may seem like sound policy to cut food stamps for near-
ly four million people, health insurance coverage to millions more or even let the federal government shut down all in the name of politics — but it’s asinine, shocking and downright scary to think what the House Republicans actually want to do to our great country. 
We have the power to end this madness and come elec-
tion time next year, I implore you ﬁ  re these bozos to save our country and ourselves.

Although the price of attending college may be rising na-
tionally, it will now be about $4,000 cheaper to get a bachelor’s 
degree in Gainesville.
Santa Fe College announced that starting in the Fall 2014 
semester, students will be able to obtain a bachelor’s degree for $10,000 or less.
The change is part of a challenge from Gov. Rick Scott, who 
announced the plan in November 2012. The cost of a bachelor’s degree from Santa Fe is currently $14,455 for in-state students, according to sfcollege.edu.  
“We think (the challenge is) the right thing to do,” said Da-
vid Houder, director of communications at Santa Fe College. “We’re all about making education affordable and we’re trying to address this and help people advance in their careers.”
Santa Fe is one of 23 colleges in the Florida College System that have all accepted the challenge. The Florida College Sys-tem includes all state and community colleges in Florida.
The first degree that will be offered in the program will be 
a degree in organizational management with other degrees ex-pected to be added in the future, Houder said. 
Not only will the program allow for more Santa Fe students 
to be able to afford degrees, it may help to increase the number of students who attend Santa Fe.
“My original plan was to transfer to UF after two years,” 
said 19-year-old Santa Fe health science second-year Brian Sheehan. “Now that Santa Fe is a lot cheaper, it makes more sense for me to just stay here.”Students won’t be able to simply just sign up for the pro-
gram, though. A student must have a grade point average of 2.5, be in-state and have a good academic standing, according to Houder.
The challenge will only reduce the cost of tuition. The plan 
will not lower the costs of textbooks, living and other expens-es.
“Any amount of money that I can save will help,” said 
19-year-old Santa Fe exercise and sports science first-year Tif-fany Pagliazzo.  “Knowing that I can invest that money in other areas will allow me to focus more on school and less on the expenses.”
Although the plan won’t go into effect for another year, 
Houder said Santa Fe feels that the program is something that is necessary for education to move forward.  
“Everyone has an eye on making education affordable and 
getting an affordable degree and advancing,” Houder said. Santa Fe to meet Gov. Scott’s $10,000 bachelor degree challenge

UF was recently ranked the No. 1 na-
tional university with the “Best Bang for 
the Buck,” according to the Washington Monthly.
The University of Georgia and the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill followed in second and third place, according to a press release from The Washington Monthly.
UF’s tuition is $6,270 a year for in-
state students compared to the national average of $8,655, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
“We’re really proud of being recog-
nized for the great value that we give our students,” Orlando said.  “When we rank so highly in some of these publica-tions, I think it’s nice for our students to know that they’re getting a great return on their investment.”
To receive a Washington Monthly 
ranking,  a college needs at least 20 per-cent of students who receive Pell Grants, a graduation rate of 50 percent and a graduation rate that exceeds the pre-dicted rate based on the number of low-income students, according to a news re-lease. Colleges must also have a student loan default rate of 10 percent or less.

I’m paying for because I’m in-state and I have Bright Futures,” said Carrie No-land, a 19-year-old UF advertising soph-omore.UF rated best bang for buck

People gathered outside the 
worn brick building at 429 NW 
4th St. on Sunday to celebrate the recognition of a historical landmark.
There were raised umbrellas, 
puddle-soaked dress pants and open doors but no unveiling.
“I put it up already,” said 
Gerard Duncan, who decided to display the Florida Heritage Site plaque on Friday. “I didn’t want this ceremony to be something that we were looking forward to as much as something that we were already doing.”
Duncan, the pastor of Prayers 
by Faith Ministries, which now occupies the building, said he fought to have the building rec-ognized as a historical landmark for its role in the civil rights movement.
The Rev. Thomas A. Wright, 
who pastored the congregation from 1962 to 2006 when it was called Mount Carmel Baptist Church, collected an offering to pay for the plaque, which cost $2,000. 
Duncan said Wright helped 
him with research during the state application process for his-torical recognition. 
“He was the forerunner for 
equality for African Americans in Gainesville,” he said.
Duncan said he applied for 
the historical recognition out of nothing but a need to better the community.
“History is everything,” he 
said “We need some history.”
The building, constructed in 
1946, was previously the local meeting place for the NAACP when organizers lobbied to de-segregate Gainesville schools and implement a biracial city commission, Duncan said. 
Bessie Collins, 22, sat with her 
2-year-old daughter Dayla Jones

Residents can expect to see a shopping cen-
ter take shape on the former site of the 13th 
Street Brasington Cadillac-Oldsmobile dealer-ship, now demolished.
The sale of the property, which is located at 
2001 NW 13th St., was finalized in late July, said Beau Beery of Coldwell Banker Commercial M.M. Parrish Realtors.
Beery, who represented the seller, Bluestone 
Lands of Houston, said the land was divided into three parcels — north, middle and south sections — and each was sold to a separate buyer.
The three separate buyers each have differ-
ent plans for their portion of the land, Beery said.
“A Dollar General is going into the middle 
parcel, while the northern part has been bought by Nathan Collier to create a better entrance to his apartment complex in back,” he said. “The southern piece was sold to a woman develop-ing a retail center — there’s been talks of it hav-ing salons and maybe a grocery store.”
Located across the street from Gainesville 
High School, the property was used as a tem-porary car sales lot after the dealership closed.
“It’s a pretty iconic place,” Beery said. “It’s 
changing hands — as it should — and everyone seems to be pretty excited about it.” 
Realtor Dan Drotos said plans for the shop-
ping strip on the southern parcel of the lot are still not finalized.  
“Nothing’s for sure for that corner of land,” 
he said. “But there’s been talks of a multitenant retail building.”
Drotos also confirmed a Dollar General will 
be built in the middle parcel, arriving as the third Dollar General in a 2-mile radius of the property.

company developing the Dollar General, could not be reached for a comment. Former Cadillac dealership

Poll Question
Is No. 20 Florida better off without Jeff Driskel as its starting 
quarterback? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.Liz Slattery is the newest freshman to make an impact for the Florida soccer team.  Read the 
story on page 13.Gators in AP Poll
Florida fell one spot to No. 20 in the Associated Press Poll released Sunday. It is the third consecutive week the Gators have dropped in the AP Poll.FIRE JOE MORGAN
Everyone is making a big deal about Florida’s quar-terback situation and de-
servedly so.
Losing your starting quarter-
back is a big deal, especially when 
your backup signal-caller throws his ﬁ  rst career pass when ﬁ  lling in for the injured starter.
But once everybody has talked them-
selves to death about how much UF will miss Jeff Driskel or value Tyler Murphy, it’s all sort of moot.
If the Gators go anywhere in 2013, their 
defense will take them there.
When asked last week if the defense 
should be held to a higher standard than the offense, linebacker Neiron Ball uttered the cliche that is so true to this Florida team.
“Defense wins championships,” Ball 
said.
No matter who lines up under center for 
UF, the offense doesn’t change much.
Both guys are mobile. Neither is going to 
throw for 300 yards consistently, but Florida certainly doesn’t need that. The Gators will just pound the ball in the ground game.
Driskel managed games well in 2012. I ex-
pect Murphy can do the same in 2013. 
Driskel wasn’t going to put the team on 
his back and win games for the Gators. Nei-ther will Murphy. 
Much like last season, this unit just needs 
to score occasionally and, most importantly, take care of the football. Once Kyle Christy snaps out of his current funk, Florida can score a few points, win the battle of ﬁ  eld po-sition and leave the game up to its defense. 
This elite group hasn’t skipped a beat 
even after losing seven starters from 2012.
Through three games, the UF defense ranks second nationally with only 212.3 yards allowed per game. Given the unit’s youth, experience will only make them better.
You see a playmaker like 
sophomore Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr., who showed off 
his game-changing ability with two forced fumbles in Saturday’s victory.
Meanwhile, freshman cornerback Vernon 
Hargreaves III is setting the world on ﬁ  re in his ﬁ  rst season of college football. He’s one of the best players in an already extremely deep secondary.
Once Loucheiz Purifoy (right thigh con-
tusion) and Marcus Roberson (sprained left knee) return to health, UF might as well pass out free blankets to opposing wide receiv-ers.
And then there is the unit’s leader, Do-
minique Easley. The upbeat, Chuckie doll-wielding, I-don’t-watch-football-I-just-like-to-hit-people defensive tackle is the engine that makes the unit go. And he only has one goal in mind.
When asked if ﬁ  nishing his college career 
with a 4-0 record against Tennessee was a point of pride for him, Easley quickly made known his desire for the crystal football.
“I want to win the national champion-
ship,” he said. “That’s my point of pride.”
Toledo, Miami and Tennessee are no-
where near the best offenses Florida will face this year, but the Gators looked dominant in signiﬁ  cant stretches against each team. That alone is promising, especially as the unit continues to jell.
Also, the turnovers are coming. After 
Hargreaves’ two interceptions were Florida’s only takeaways during the ﬁ  rst two weeks, UF was just picking on UT’s offense. Upcom-ing games against Kentucky and Arkansas provide even more opportunities for Florida to build conﬁ  dence in its ball-hawking iden-tity before facing LSU, Georgia, et al.
After the Gators gave up two quick touch-
downs in their loss to the Hurricanes on Sept. 7, coach Will Muschamp placed the blame on Florida’s defense. Fair or not, that’s the way it is in Gainesville. Whoever plays quarter-back isn’t going to change that dynamic.
Murphy’s job is no different than Driskel’s 
— take care of the ball and let the defense do the rest.
Defense will determine UF’s success regardless of quarterback

Two trainers attend to quarterback Jeff Driskel after he suffered a fractured right ﬁ  bula 
during Florida’s 31-17 victory against Tennessee on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
The Gators saw ﬁ  rsthand the 
consequences of the NCAA’s new 
targeting rule on Saturday.
In the fourth quarter of then-
No. 19 Florida’s (2-1) 31-17 win against Tennessee (2-2) in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, defensive back Brian Poole was ejected after vio-lating the new targeting rule de-signed to prevent head injuries. 
Referees disqualiﬁ  ed Poole af-
ter he made a high hit on Tennes-see tight end Brendan Downs. Fol-lowing the penalty call, ofﬁ  cials reviewed the ejection, which is required by the rule change. After a review, the call was conﬁ  rmed. 
“It was the right call,” coach 
Will Muschamp said. “I don’t have any problem with the call. I got a problem with the rule.
“Brian Poole was not trying 
to ﬂ  agrantly hurt anyone. It’s a bang-bang play.”
By the NCAA’s standards, 
“targeting” refers to above-the-shoulder hits on players who are deemed to be defenseless. Pre-viously, targeting  was only a 15-yard penalty on the targeting player. The rule was changed be-fore the season began. 
Because Poole was ejected in the second half of Saturday’s game, he will also be ineligible for the ﬁ  rst half of Florida’s game against Kentucky on Sept. 28.
Poole was the 
ﬁ  rst Florida play-
er to be ejected due to the new rule.
“I didn’t like 
it,” defensive tackle Domin-ique Easley said. “You know, it’s 
football. Let him play.”
Injured Gators: Aside from 
quarterback Jeff Driskel, who suf-fered a season-ending leg injury in the ﬁ  rst quarter against Tennes-see, several other Florida players were injured before and during Saturday’s game.
The Gators announced prior to 
the game that right tackle Tyler Moore (ankle), cornerback Marcus Roberson (knee) and running back Valdez Showers (ankle) would miss the game due to injury.
Moore and Roberson both suf-
fered their injuries against Miami on Sept. 7, while Showers’ injury came during practice on Wednes-day.
Muschamp said he expects 
Moore and Roberson to return against Kentucky but said Show-ers’ injury may keep the sopho-more out longer.
Cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy had to leave the game on Satur-day due to a right thigh contusion. Muschamp said the injury was not serious, and he expects Purifoy to return for Kentucky.
Wideouts suspended: Gators 
wide receivers Latroy Pittman and Demarcus Robinson both missed Saturday’s game due to violations of team rules.
Pittman was suspended before 
Florida’s season opener against Toledo on Aug. 31. 
The team announced Rob-
inson’s suspension before the Gators took the ﬁ  eld against the Volunteers on Saturday.
Muschamp said after the game 
that both Pittman and Robinson will be eligible for next week’s game on Sept. 28.

Volunteers coach Butch Jones put it 
lightly when he said after the game that 
his team played the worst half of football it could play offensively.
Tennessee generated 31 yards on 25 
plays of offense in the first half. For the game, the Volunteers averaged 3.9 yards a play and committed six turnovers.
Florida feasted on redshirt freshman 
Nathan Peterman, who completed 4-of-11 passes for five yards and two intercep-tions in his first career start. The defense responded to coach Will Muschamp’s chal-lenge during the bye week for perfection af-ter giving up two early touchdowns against Miami on Sept. 7.
“That was the whole focus to be more 
sound on defense, and to make sure every-thing we did on defense was perfect,” de-fensive tackle Darious “Bear” Cummings said. “Everybody came and told us how good of a defense we were, and we felt insulted because that wasn’t the best we could’ve played against Miami. We came out and I feel like we made a statement to-day against Tennessee.”Cummings provided a moment of lev-
ity for No. 19 Florida (2-1, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) during a 31-17 win on Satur-day. On third and 9 at the UF 27, Peterman lost his grip while throwing the football. Cummings snagged the wobbly pass and looked to score a 70-yard interception re-turn.Then, Dominique Easley ran into Cum-
mings around the UT 40.
“I told them in the locker room after the 
game, ‘I don’t know who looks worse — me jogging on campus or Darious returning that interception,’” Muschamp said.
The interception marked Tennessee’s 
fourth turnover in less than a half of foot-ball. Florida did not fare much better, com-mitting three turnovers itself, but Tennes-see could never generate any consistent offense.
Dante Fowler Jr. and Michael Taylor 
recovered fumbles while Jabari Gorman, Brian Poole and Marcus Maye snagged in-terceptions in addition to Cummings. After the first 30 minutes, Tennessee had more interception yards (62) than passing yards (5).
Muschamp wasn’t happy with the 149 
passing yards from Peterman’s replace-ment, Justin Worley. Tennessee beat Florida on wheel routes up the sideline, including safety Cody Riggs on an 18-yard touch-down pass to Pig Howard.
Yet despite the late snafu, Florida came 
much closer to the “perfect” defense that its coach expects. Against Miami, the defense surrendered two first-half touchdowns to quarterback Stephen Morris.
The defense to its coach on Saturday: 
Challenge accepted.
“With that whole bye week, he basically 
put us through camp again,” Easley said. “He expects perfection, so we can’t get mad at him for that.”
Added Fowler: “He challenged us a lot. 
Our defense, we take pride in it and take it very seriously. We came out with a very big chip on our shoulders and we wanted to play hard. We want to perfect it and do what we’re supposed to do — play fast and physical.”

Liz Slattery is the latest fresh-
man to make an impact for the 
Gators.
The freshman midfielder 
scored her first collegiate goal to help Florida (7-1-1) earn a 3-0 shutout against Alabama (2-6) at James G. Pressly Stadium on Fri-day night.
Slattery is the fifth freshman to 
score for UF this season.
“I saw an opening,” Slattery 
said. “I just went for it.” 
After being substituted in with 
fewer than 20 minutes remaining in the match, Slattery found the back of the net despite not usu-ally serving as an offensive threat for the Gators.
Defender Tessa Andujar, who 
was on the far flank, sent a ser-vice to the box that put Slattery in the perfect position to quickly make something happen. 
The freshman took a precise 
shot from five yards to the left of the box and sent the ball di-agonally past Crimson Tide goal-keeper Emily Rusk and into the right corner of the net.
Andujar collected the assist on 
the play.
“[Andujar] served the most 
beautiful ball, dropped it right at the penalty spot,” Slattery said. 
“I just went up for it and 
served it back to the post it came from.”
Coach Becky Burleigh added: 
“Liz’s goal was a great goal. She put it across the keeper. Textbook — it was perfect.”
Slattery, a native of Cincin-nati, came to Florida as an expe-rienced scorer.
She led the Cincinnati United 
Premier Crew Jr. Gold 94/95 club team with 13 goals and eight as-sists in 2011-2012. 
She finished her high school 
career for Indian Hill with 66 goals and 36 assists, with 17 of those goals coming during her senior year.
Prior to the season, Burleigh 
said this crop of freshmen was an underrated group. So far, she is correct. 
Freshman Savannah Jordan 
leads the way, having scored 10 goals to pace UF. But Jordan is just one of eight true fresh-men who have produced for the Gators.
Katie Richmond and Kristen 
Cardano are the only non-goal-keeper freshmen who have not scored for Florida in 2013. 
Florida’s first-year players do 
not just score goals, though. One stops them from happening.
Twenty-one-year-old fresh-
man Nora Neset Gjoen began the season in an open competi-tion with incumbent goalkeeper Taylor Burke. Gjoen allowed four goals in three games before suf-fering a concussion against Flor-ida State on Aug. 30.
The production of UF’s fresh-
man class — which has scored 15 of Florida’s 21 goals this sea-son and appears to be one of the most talented classes the Gators have had in recent memory — has helped offset the loss of Erika Tymrak, Kat Williamson and Jo Dragotta from last season. It also offers optimism as the 
group continues to improve.
“It’s so exciting because you 
think about the next four years, and I just cannot wait,” Slattery said. 
“Everyone in our class has 
so many different talents and so many of us have yet to even re-veal those. I can’t wait for the next four years. It’s going to be awesome.”

Murphy ﬁ  nished with 218 all-purpose yards and two touchdowns
here, and it’s disappointing for him 
right now.”
Muschamp said after the game 
that Driskel would have surgery Sunday.
The injury to UF’s junior signal-
caller forced Tyler Murphy, a junior who had not thrown an ofﬁ  cial pass for the Gators, into the starting role.
Murphy responded better than 
Florida could have envisioned, com-pleting 8 of 14 passing attempts for 134 yards and a touchdown. He added 84 rushing yards and a sec-ond touchdown on 10 carries to help the Gators beat the Volunteers for the ninth straight time dating back to 2004 — the series’ longest stretch of dominance since Tennessee won 10 consecutive matchups from 1916-1953.
“It was always in the back of my 
mind that I might never play,” said Murphy, who has been surpassed on the depth chart by Driskel, Jacoby Brissett, John Brantley, Jordan Reed and Trey Burton during his career at Florida.
“I just kept working hard and 
kept ﬁ  ghting and kept faith in my-self and kept praying for an oppor-tunity. It wasn’t the way I wanted, but an opportunity is an opportu-nity.”
Murphy was given a chance af-
ter Driskel was knocked out of the game with 9:23 remaining in the ﬁ  rst quarter.
Playing with a brace on his left 
leg after spraining his knee during a 21-16 loss to Miami, Driskel forced a pass into coverage on third and 3 during UF’s second possession that was intercepted by Tennessee’s Devaun Swafford and returned 62 yards for a touchdown.
After releasing the pass, Driskel 
was pulled awkwardly to the turf by Tennessee’s Marlon Walls, who rolled over the quarterback’s right foot. Driskel immediately signaled to Florida’s training staff for help and spent time being looked at on the sideline before using a pair of crutches to get to the locker room.Muschamp did not learn the ex-
tent of Driskel’s injury until halftime but knew upon watching him ask for assistance that the Gators could be without their starter for an ex-tended period of time.
“When he looked at the sideline 
and waved, I knew it was not good,” Muschamp said. “I’m disappointed for Jeff because he’s worked ex-tremely hard for this season.
“One man’s misfortunes are an-
other man’s opportunity, and Tyler Murphy certainly took advantage of his opportunity.”
Trailing 7-0, Murphy orchestrat-
ed a scoring drive on his second pos-session, which ended with a 23-yard ﬁ  eld goal by Austin Hardin to cut the Gators’ deﬁ  cit to 7-3. On Florida’s next drive, Murphy connected with Solomon Patton on a swing pass that turned into a 52-yard catch-and-run touchdown to give UF its ﬁ  rst lead of the game.
“It’s tough for any team to lose 
your starting quarterback,” Patton said. “Jeff was doing a great job until he got hurt, and Murphy stepped up big time.”
The touchdown reception was 
Patton’s second of the season. The senior has spearheaded a produc-tive Florida receiving corps that lost three of its top four pass-catchers from 2012.
“I’m pretty sure we were ranked 
the 10th wide receiver core in the Southeastern Conference,” Burton said. “We took that to heart. We didn’t believe that. We thought we were a lot better than that, and we are trying to prove that.”
Touchdown runs by Mack Brown and Matt Jones sandwiched a made ﬁ  eld goal by Tennessee to give Flori-da a 24-10 lead midway through the third quarter.
The Volunteers never got closer 
than two scores the rest of the way, losing to the Gators by double-digits for the seventh consecutive season.
“Losing is never accepted at Ten-
nessee and never tolerated,” UT coach Butch Jones said. “But I’m proud of our football team. I thought they showed resiliency. They didn’t quit. They gave us an opportunity to be in the game at the end of the game, and we have to keep getting better.”
UF would have been in deeper 
trouble early in the game if not for the play of its defense, one of the na-tion’s elite units.
Punter Kyle Christy mishandled a snap on Florida’s opening posses-sion, giving Tennessee the ball on the UF 15-yard line. But instead of UT grabbing early momentum, the Gators defense punched the Volun-teers in the mouth.
On the second play of UT’s drive, 
Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. burst through the offensive line and hammered Volunteers running back Rajion Neal. The hit dislodged the ball, and Fowler had the presence of mind to recover it.
Fowler later added a second 
forced fumble. Florida’s defense forced six turnovers in the game.
“That was our whole game plan 
coming in,” defensive tackle Domi-nique Easley said. “Just to get turn-overs.”
Easley was involved in a humor-
ous encounter late in the second quarter. Tennessee quarterback Na-than Peterman — who completed 4 of 11 passes for 5 yards before being pulled in favor of Justin Worley — threw the second of his two inter-ceptions into the arms of defensive lineman Darious “Bear” Cummings at UF’s 30-yard line.
Cummings appeared to be in po-
sition to return the interception for a touchdown until Easley inadver-tently tripped him from behind.
“He’s too slow; you just gotta 
keep running,” Easley said. “I tried to get behind and help him out, but he started slowing down and then just started blowing.
“I seen him going down, so I 
didn’t want him to lose the ball, so as he was falling down, I just pushed him right when he got to the ground.”
The amusing play was temporal 
for the Gators, who must now adjust to life without Driskel. Florida plays at Kentucky at 7 p.m. on Saturday and need a sharp defense as Mur-phy works his way into the full-time starting role.
“Man down, man up, that was 
our complete reaction,” center Jon Harrison said. “Nobody is freaked out. It’s just our mentality. You have to be ready, and that’s what coach Muschamp prepares us for.”

The stat line reads the same for 
almost every game — Taylor Brau-
neis leads Florida in assists while Chloe Mann and Ziva Recek take turns leading in kills. 
Another constant for the No. 4 
Gators (11–1) has been strong play from their bench. 
“It’s not easy to come in off the 
bench and all the expectations that come with it,” coach Mary Wise said after Saturday’s sweep of Mar-quette.  
“[The bench players] feel very 
confident.” 
A deep bench — helped by the 
additions of freshman Alex Holston and sophomore transfer Mackenzie Dagostino — has allowed Wise to relieve her starters.
All but four players on the roster 
have played 21 or more sets. One of those four, Noami Santos-Lamb, is still recovering from an ACL injury that forced her to miss all of last sea-son. 
Dagostino often gives way to 
Brauneis during critical points, but opponents feel her presence when she is on the court. 
Dagostino is second on UF with 
2.75 assists per set and leads the team with a serving percentage of .984. 
In Florida’s win over Iona on 
Sept. 14, Dagostino had a team-high 40 assists. 
Mann and Recek are two of the 
best hitters in the country, but Hol-ston boasts a hitting percentage of .410 — the third best clip among Gators who have at least 40 attempts and percentage that is in the top 40 in the nation.
Holston is not the only role 
player having an unheralded year. Sophomore middle blocker Simone Antwi leads UF with 38 blocks and is third on the team with 2.9 points per set. 
Antwi is also second on the team 
with a serving percentage of .930, showing the versatility that the 6-foot-2 hitter has with her move from blocking to serving.   
During her freshman season, 
Antwi played sparingly.
Former Gator Tangerine Wiggs 
saw most of the time on the court at middle blocker. With Wiggs’ de-parture, the Gators have relied on Antwi to be a fundamental contrib-utor in all areas. 
Having Antwi perform on kills, 
blocks and serving is one of the main reasons Florida has only one loss this season, which came to No. 1 Penn State in the sixth game of the year. 
Not only have the Gators 
dropped only one match, but out-side of their matchup with the Nit-tany Lions, they have lost only three sets, which includes games against No. 8 Stanford, LIU-Brooklyn and Western Michigan.
Last season, the Gators had al-
ready been swept and lost six sets through their fifth match.
