Fatal Scooter Crash
A 40-year-old woman died riding a scooter northbound on Southwest 34th Street near Radio Road after a car rear-ended her into the back of a pickup truck Wednesday night, according to Gainesville Police.
STAFF REPORT
Three days after true freshman 
quarterback Treon Harris was ac-
cused of sexually assaulting a 
student at a UF residence hall, 
an incident report was released. 
However, with the majority of the report withheld by state law, most 
questions are left unanswered as the investigation into the alleged 
assault continues.
The 18-page report conﬁ  rms the 
time and location of the incident: 
between 2:30 and 3:25 a.m. Sunday 
at the Springs Residential Com-
plex. It also conﬁ  rmed the offense 
was sexual battery. The rest of the 
narrative was redacted.
Florida law requires all active criminal intel-
ligence informa-tion and active 
criminal investi-
gative informa-
tion to be with-
held from the 
public.
“We cannot 
discuss what is happening at all because it is protected by student privacy laws,” UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes wrote in an email.
Sikes said the UF Student Con-
duct process “seeks to provide a 
fair, compassionate, safe and equi-
table place for students to tell their 
perceptions of what happened and 
for decision makers to determine, 
using a more likely than not stan-dard, whether the Conduct Code was violated.”
Attempts to speak with UF law 
professors were made but none were available for comment.
“Most people just aren’t go-
ing to want to comment on the subject,” Sikes said. “But our pro-
fessors have academic freedom 
and can speak on whatever topic they’d like.”

As the Ebola epidemic 
continues to cause con-
cern, UF scholars gathered Wednesday to discuss the issue.  
About 200 students, fac-
ulty and community mem-bers ﬁ  lled the Ocora in Pugh Hall to listen to the evening panel.  
The UF panelists included 
Dr. Paul Psychas, assistant professor of community health and family medicine; Sharon Abramowitz, assis-tant professor of anthropol-
ogy; Timothy Nevin, visiting 
professor in the Department 
of History; and Jill Sonke, di-rector of the Center for Arts in Medicine.
UF’s dean of international 
studies, Leonardo Villalon, moderated the discussion.
The U.S. medical system 
has the capacity to handle 
the disease, he said at the 
event.
“These kind of things test 
our system,” Villalon said. 
“There have already been 
critiques of the situation in 
Dallas.”

A UF student in the journalism col-
lege was arrested Wednesday morning 
after police said he sold multiple copies 
of counterfeit tickets for Saturday’s UF vs. 
Louisiana State University football game. 
Jordan Joseph Peters, 24, was reported 
to Gainesville Police by a person who pur-chased tickets from him Tuesday on Craig-slist.
The advertisement Peters posted fea-
tured a photo of the tickets, and the two met in person for the transaction.
Following the exchange, the buyer be-
came suspicious of the tickets’ validity 
and contacted the University Athletic As-
sociation ticket ofﬁ  ce. Covert GPD ofﬁ  cers 
contacted Peters early Wednesday to buy tickets 
from him. Upon meeting 
with investigators at a set location, Peters gave them 
the same counterfeit tick-
ets he had given the vic-
tim the day before.
Police found an additional 26 copies of 
the same tickets in his backpack.
Peters said he completed three or four 
transactions. All copies were under the name Richard Ronson and listed the seats as Section 19, Row 51, Seats 2 through 6.
Peters was arrested on charges of grand 
theft, scheme to defraud and fraudulent creation and possession of admission tick-ets.
All the victims of the scheme were con-
tacted. GPD urges anyone else who pur-chased tickets from Peters or has tickets for the listed seats to contact police.
Peters was booked into Alachua County 
Jail around noon, where he remained with 
no bond set as of press time.UF student arrested for counterfeiting tickets for LSU gameSEE PANEL, PAGE 4The 18-page incident report was mostly redacted

CRIME
MELISSA MIHM
Alligator Staff Writer mmihm@alligator.org
Gainesville Police and the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce are asking locals to 
keep an eye out for a recent door-to-door scammer.
According to police, Carisa Dineen-Lew-
is has been asking Alachua County residents for gas money, claiming it is so she can visit her terminally ill mother in Georgia. How-ever, police said Dineen-Lewis’ mother is not terminally ill and this is a scam.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said 
Dineen-Lewis has been seen in the area of 4400 SW 34th St., 700 SW 16th Ave. and 1600 NW 35th Place. 
“Basically all over,” he wrote in an 
email.
Tobias said there are three documented 
victims of Dineen-Lewis’ scam with a total loss of $80: $30 from one victim and $50 from another.
“Our recommendation is to not answer 
the door for anyone you’re not expecting,” Tobias said. 
“Unfortunately it’s not ‘like it used to be’ 
and folks are not always honest.”
Dineen-Lewis was arrested twice in 2008 
on criminal trafﬁ  c charges. In July, she was arrested on charges of false imprisonment and battery on a person 65 years of age or older. 
Police ﬁ  led charges with the State At-
torney’s Ofﬁ  ce and are urging people not to give money to Dineen-Lewis and contact the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce if they are targeted.Police warn of gas money scam
� $50 IN CREDIT FOR SERVICE.

A local nonproﬁ  t’s new program will al-
low volunteers to turn service credit into a 
car.
Pledge 5 Foundation’s Community 
Overdrive program will reward volunteers 
$50 in credit for each service event they at-
tend. The credits accumulated will give consistently involved volunteers the chance to buy a car for a reduced price.
“We’re always looking for ways to en-
tice people to do volunteer work,” said Ja-son Bowman, CEO of Pledge 5 Foundation. “So we look for rewards that are central to living.” The organization also offers the Rent 5 
program to receive discounted rent.
Service socials are hosted every week-
end, and typical shifts last about ﬁ  ve hours, Bowman said. Events include working with other nonproﬁ  ts such as the Ronald McDonald House Charities of North Cen-tral Florida and the Kanapaha Botanical 
Gardens.
All socials are free, and a list can be 
found on Pledge 5 Foundation’s website 
and Facebook page.
Lindsey Peterson, a 19-year-old UF 
health science sophomore, has volunteered at every service event since August.
“Volunteering at a variety of places with 
Pledge 5 has made me learn about parts of 
Gainesville that I didn’t prior,” she said, 
“and to be able to help out those different organizations is an awesome feeling.”Pledge 5 rewards volunteers

issues ranging from Ebola’s impact on 
West Africa to how the countries medical 
systems are ill-equipped to handle the out-
break.
Villalon also stressed the importance 
of awareness and education about the dis-
ease.
“I think it’s the most important thing we 
can do,” he said. “No one in Gainesville is 
likely to get it.”
Alysha Cooper, a 19-year-old UF biol-
ogy junior, attended the event as a part of 
UF’s Ebola research group.
“It’s important to have information on 
the CDC, Atlanta and Texas, but it’s easy 
for us to see Africa as a blob far from us,” she said. “Education is key.”
Abramowitz, who organized the event, 
is leading the Ebola research group at UF.  Abramowitz said students should take ac-tion and help Ebola affected countries.
“I would encourage people and student 
organizations to start doing more fund-raising,” she said.
Paul Psychas was the ﬁ  rst presenter of 
the evening.
He said he worked on the Ebola out-
break in Central Africa in 2002.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention predicts that there will be between 1.2 and 1.4 million cases of Ebola in West Africa by January 2015, Psychas said in his presentation.
“You can watch a whole string of head-
lines and never get the bigger picture,” Psychas said.
UF stakeholders met to discuss strat-
egies for handling the virus on campus Tuesday, Psychas said.
Medical staff are running drills at the 
UF Health Shands Hospital to practice iso-lating and treating an Ebola patient.
Joscelyn Essegbey, a Gainesville resi-
dent, attended the discussion to hear about the differences in treatment for the disease.
“The disease has no borders,” Essegbey 
said. “We become aware of what we can bring in and take out.”

A week after UF sent out a mass 
email to the Student Body, no new 
information is available on the stu-
dent hospitalized with meningo-
coccal disease.
Nadia Kovacevich, an epidemi-
ologist at the Florida Department 
of Health in Alachua County, said 
the department has located every-one who was in contact with the student.“Everyone that was considered 
high risk was located and informed of the disease,” she said. “The uni-versity was given the information to make sure that we didn’t need to contact any other high risk indi-
viduals.”
Jamie Kerzner, a 19-year-old 
UF biology sophomore, attended 
Coral Gables Senior High School 
in Miami with the Georgetown 
University student who died in September from meningitis.
“From what I’ve heard from other friends, when she got to the 
hospital it was too late,” she said. 
“I’m not sure if she thought she 
just had a cold, but it’s very unfor-
tunate and very sad.”
Kerzner said the idea of getting 
the disease is worrisome.“I just need to be aware of my 
health,” she said. “That goes for everyone. I think everyone has a complex where they think they can tough it out.”
Meningococcal disease, a type 
of meningitis caused by a bacte-ria carried by people in their nasal passages or throat, can spread from person to person until the germ is 
no longer present, according to the 
Florida Department of Health.
Prevention for contracting the 
disease includes vaccinations, avoidance of sharing eating uten-sils and covering the nose and 
mouth when coughing or sneez-
ing.
Talking to a health care provid-
er and making sure the appropri-ate testing is done is another way 
to prevent the disease, Kovacevich 
said.
No other cases of the disease 
have been reported.
Symptoms include fever, head-
ache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity to light and altered mental status, according to the U.S. Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention.No new meningitis cases after UF student hospitalization

UF campus research centers have banded to -
gether to form a diabetes institute.
Five grants, totaling $13.6 million, helped 
fund the program. The grants were from the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 
and Kidney Diseases, which is part of the Na -
tional Institutes of Health.
“We were very excited about these awards 
because UF may be the most represented in an 
effort to understand the role of insulin produc -
ing cells in Type 1 diabetes,” institute director 
Mark Atkinson said.
The institute will be staffed with about 100 
faculty members from the colleges of medicine, 
engineering, public health and health profes -
sions, nursing and the Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences (IFAS).
The institute will focus on advancing treat -
ment for patients with both Type 1 or Type 2 
diabetes.
Atkinson said UF diabetes research is one of 
the top in the country in terms of Type 1 dia -
betes. 
According to Atkinson, the institute has a 
threefold mission that will dedicate diabetes 
research to improving clinical care and advanc -ing the teaching and training of the next gen -
eration of researchers and caregivers.
“We cannot afford to let the diabetes epi -
demic continue,” Atkinson said.  “We need to 
do a better job of educating people what diabe -
tes is and how to avoid it.”
One in every 10 Floridians has diabetes, said 
Dr. Kenneth Cusi, the institute’s adult medical 
director.
IFAS will be involved in outreach programs 
to educate the community about ways to pre -
vent Type 2 diabetes.
“We hope that we will have an impact in in -
spiring the new generations to join this crusade 
in curing diabetes,” Cusi said. “I’m very excit -
ed. This is probably the most important initia -
tive for patients because Florida has one of the 
highest rates in diabetes.”
David S. Guzick, senior vice president for 
health affairs at UF and president of UF Health, 
said he hopes to work with IFAS to prevent pa -
tients from developing Type 2 diabetes. 
“We have to realize that diabetes is a sig -
nificant health problem,” he said. “We have a 
commitment to improving health throughout 
the state.” 
Leeana Peters, 19, conducts research on Type 
1 diabetes in the Todd M. Brusko Laboratory 
and has seen diabetes in her family. Her 6-year-
old sister was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes 
at the age of 3. 
“I am absolutely ecstatic that UF is establish -
ing an institute to conduct more research on 
diabetes,” the UF biology sophomore said.UF uses grants to start diabetes

The viral respiratory infection 
that shocked the Midwest in August 
made its way to Florida this week.
The Florida Department of 
Health confirmed Tuesday the 
state’s first case of Enterovirus D68 was detected in a 10-year-old girl in 
Polk County. 
According to a press release, the 
girl is recovering. No other informa -
tion was revealed on her condition.
The virus is highly contagious 
and spread through droplets in 
coughs or sneezes, or through con -
tact with contaminated surfaces, 
such as countertops or doorknobs. It 
has proven especially dangerous for infants and young children.
Florida joins 43 states and Wash -
ington, D.C. that have reported more 
than 500 total cases of Enterovirus 
D68 nationwide. A 4-year-old boy 
in New Jersey died of the infection 
on Sept. 25 and an additional four 
people infected with the virus have 
died, but it’s unclear if the deaths 
were caused by the virus. 
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
almost all the cases have involved 
children. 
The Florida Department of Health 
said the virus is often mistaken for 
the common cold or flu, and those 
with asthma are at a higher risk of 
infection. Symptoms may include 
wheezing, trouble breathing, high 
fever with ill appearance, thick nasal 
discharge and signs of dehydration. The department recommends 
washing hands frequently and dis -
infecting surfaces with nonalcoholic 
products. Alcohol-based products, 
such as hand sanitizers, are not ef -
fective in combating the disease. 
Nadia Kovacevich, an epidemiol -
ogist with the Florida Department of 
Health in Alachua County, said the 
agency is urging residents to remain 
at home if they are not feeling well. Polk County 10-year-old girl diagnosed with Enterovirus

Last Friday, director David Lynch sent out a rather 
interesting tweet: “Dear Twitter Friends: That gum you like is going to come back in style!”
Fans of Lynch and his cult-hit TV series “Twin Peaks” 
knew this had to be an important message, hinting at the 
possibility of the series’ return.
On Monday, the theories were conﬁ  rmed when Show-
time announced it is picking up nine episodes of “Twin 
Peaks,” which will air sometime in 2016.
If you haven’t watched “Twin Peaks” yet, I strongly 
encourage you to do so. Television as we know it today simply wouldn’t exist without this show.
“Twin Peaks” premiered in 1990 and was canceled af-
ter two seasons due to low ratings, but it forever changed 
the way stories are told on TV. It received tons of critical 
acclaim and instant status as a cult icon, and its fanbase has only grown over the years.
What is “Twin Peaks?” There’s no way I could do it 
justice in a single paragraph, but I’ll try anyway. It’s the story of what happens after the most popular girl in a small town in the state of Washington is murdered. It tells the stories of the FBI agent who comes to investigate, the townspeople’s not-so-quaint secrets and the dark, super-
natural forces in the woods. The show is about the violent 
struggle between good and evil, love and damn ﬁ  ne cups of coffee. “Twin Peaks” is, at times, quirky and hilarious, and at other times horriﬁ  cally cold, hard and brilliant.
Now that I’ve ﬁ  nished gushing, I need to confess: I’m 
not actually that excited about “Twin Peaks” coming back.
I’m sorry, but I’m not buying it — literally.Something tells me some Showtime executive saw an 
opportunity to backstroke through a pool of money so big it would make Scrooge McDuck feel modest. Or, at the very least, Showtime realized it’s going to have to step up its game if they’re going to compete with HBO’s program-ming in the long run.  
Signing “Twin Peaks” is a godsend for Showtime. The 
network can expect thousands of diehard fans to hop on for the new season, as well as legions of insecure, over-ea-ger twenty-somethings desper-ate to seem like they know what they’re talking about at parties.
I have enormous respect for 
Lynch, and I’m not calling into 
question his integrity as an art-
ist. However, a powerful lust for organic coffee and cigarettes doesn’t pay for itself, and surely no one can blame an artist for 
agreeing to get paid obscene amounts of money to pro-duce more of his work.
I’m simply skeptical. I have sincere doubts these next 
nine episodes will be as good as the originals. I point to 
the prequel/sequel ﬁ  lm “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me” 
— which some consider both an artistic and a ﬁ  nancial disaster — as well as the fact that every member of the original cast is now either signiﬁ  cantly older or has kicked the bucket.
Yesterday, I watched the “Psych” tribute to “Twin 
Peaks” — you know, for research purposes — which used many actors from the original series. Twenty-ﬁ  ve years ago, they convincingly played hot high school students. 
In the tribute, they convincingly played wrinkly, gray-
haired, middle-aged people. It was profoundly upsetting.
Retroactive ﬁ  nal seasons hardly work out well at all 
— I’m looking at you, season four of “Arrested Develop-ment” — even if they’re objectively OK. Even if these new episodes are of passable quality, they’re inherently unnec-essary. Part of what makes cult TV shows so sacred in our society is that they died before they had a chance to be terrible. We get to remember the greatness of the shows 
without coping with a disappointing ﬁ  nish.
Obviously, I’ll be watching these new episodes of 
“Twin Peaks” along with all the other diehard fans. 
However, I still believe there’s no need to resurrect the 
mythology. 
The show really should be left in peace.

investigation?New ‘positive’ Scott 
ad hypocritical and 
misleading
The Florida governor’s race has seen some strange ads 
this election season. In particular, the recent ad from the College Republican National Committee that compared 
incumbent Gov. Rick Scott and challenger Charlie Crist to wed-ding dresses set a new standard for bizarre political advertising. 
Scott’s “Flippin’ Amazing!” attack ad against Crist also made 
waves for its strange — albeit amusing — brand of humor.
Now another ad from Scott’s campaign has many Floridians 
scratching their heads. The ad doesn’t contain any ostentatious formalwear or clever catchphrases. Instead, the TV spot contains a strangely hypocritical argument coming directly from the gov-ernor himself.
The ad, which Scott’s campaign is trying to brand as a new, 
positive message, begins with the governor looking into the 
camera and saying:
“After all these attack ads, Charlie Crist wants you to hate 
me. I guess that’s all he’s got.”
Leaving aside the fact that this supposedly “positive” ad is 
really just an attack against Crist for running a negative cam-
paign, Scott’s entire message is incredibly hypocritical.
According to Marc Caputo of the Miami Herald, in the last 
nine weeks, “likely voters in Florida have at least glimpsed 2.1 million ads bashing Crist and 1.7 million ads bashing Scott.”
This means Scott’s campaign has run more than 26 percent 
more negative ads than Crist’s.
Scott’s ads have not only been overwhelmingly negative but 
also factually misleading or simply false.
Earlier this year, Scott’s campaign ran an ad featuring a Fort 
Lauderdale investor named Dean Kretschmar who claimed to have been “swindled” and “bankrupted” by Ponzi-schemer and former Crist donor Scott Rothstein.
Media investigations revealed that Kretschmar’s lawyer, 
William R. Scherer, is a donor to Scott’s campaign. Not only that, Kretschmar wasn’t even actually bankrupted; he recouped the majority of the $8 million he invested in Rothstein’s scheme.
The implication of the ad, that Crist was somehow involved 
in Rothstein’s illegal ﬁ  nancial maneuvering, is completely bo-gus, as Scott himself later acknowledged.
The proliferation of negative advertising is one of the biggest 
problems with the modern American political system. Rather than engaging in honest debate about public policy issues and 
proposing solutions, politicians seek to drag each other into the 
mud with petty, often false, personal attacks. And rather than selecting a candidate who best represents their interests and val-ues, voters end up choosing between the lesser of two evils.
Scott’s half-hearted attempt to turn the governor’s race in a 
positive direction would be mildly praiseworthy if he were not so hypocritical.
If Scott wants to attack Crist for running negative ads, he 
should take his own advice and stop the negativity coming from his campaign. Right now, he’s throwing some very hefty stones from a very ﬂ  imsy glass house.

The turnout for Luke Bryan’s 
Farm Tour 2014 stop in Gainesville  
Saturday night was like something, 
well, straight from a Luke Bryan song.
Mud-splattered trucks by the 
hundreds crowded the giant field 
on Whitehurst Cattle Company in 
Archer. Boys in camo and overalls, minus shirts, and girls in all manner of sundresses, cowboy boots and body glitter drank from Miller Lite 
tallboys. In the center of the field, a 
giant stage stood flanked by semi-trucks bearing Bryan’s face and Cabela’s slogan, #ItsInMyNature. Red-topped Smirnoff tents stood 
next to stands selling leather belts 
and cowboy boots.
With a No.1 single and multi-
million-dollar national tour, Bryan is a veritable country cash cow. 
Sponsored by 5-hour Energy, Ca-
bela’s and Miller Lite, his sixth an-
nual Farm Tour, with special guest 
up-and-comer country artist Cole Swindell, comes off the tails of his That’s My Kind of Night Tour, which has thus far grossed more 
than $55.5 million. A portion of the 
concert proceeds will go toward the Luke Bryan Farm Tour Scholarship, which awards scholarship money 
to college students from farming 
families around the communities 
on the tour’s stops.
Bryan’s goofy charm and soror-ity girl sex appeal are enough to 
allow him to skate by on tired, re-
petitive lyrics about country babes, 
drinking and trucks laid over sim-plistic, three-chord rock progres-sions. There’s a reason why critics, including Tom Petty, have pointed 
out that today’s bestselling country 
music is more Bon Jovi than Hank Williams.
After Swindell’s raucous open-
ing set, the lights dimmed and a 
clip of Bryan shooting a flaming 
crossbow played over the monitors on stage — a familiar scene from 
one of his Cabela’s ads. Then began 
his act with plenty of hip gyrating, contrived shout-outs to the Gators win and live performances of the hits that have propelled him for-ward as today’s top-earning male country artist. 
And though Bryan’s success is 
purely commercial — Rolling Stone gave his 2013 album “Crash My Party” just two and a half stars — the Farm Tour illustrates the crux 
of his appeal. Whether it’s one 
three-minute, three-chord song or one night spent on a farm 30 min-utes away from campus, the Bryan listener can escape into a rural fan-
tasy of whiskey, catfish dinners and 
country girls shaking it on the hood of daddy’s tractor.
I would venture to guess it’s a 
fantasy that doesn’t exist for the average Bryan fan. On Saturday, as he launched into “Rain Is a Good Thing” — prompting the girl be-hind me to upend her Miller Lite on 
the back of my legs in excitement — 
and images of corn fields and trac-tors played on the screens behind him, a girl next to me cracked open a canned Smirnoff screwdriver. In 
front of me, people held their smart 
phones high above their heads to capture video of Bryan bounding across the stage. The next day the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of UF students who’d taken a break to get muddy on a farm returned to 
their apartments, fraternity houses 
and the Starbucks in their libraries.
Sure, Bryan has tapped into a lu-
crative brand of rural escapism, and sure, maybe some of it rings a bit 
phony — Bryan has, at this point, 
pushed the limit on the amount of times one artist can mention catfish in his songs. But as the sun sank over Whitehurst Cattle Company, the temperature dropped and feel-good country song after feel-good 
country song played. Bryan’s pop-
country crossover appeal became clear. He’s a cute, affable guy with a guitar and just the right amount of songwriting chops — besides genre 
and time, what separates Bryan 
from Frankie Valli, Elvis Presley or John Mayer? 
It’s a familiar formula, and it’s 
one that works.

Wizard-themed drinks are whizzing 
into UF’s Starbucks this month.
The Wizard’s Quest is a monthlong 
promotion featuring concoctions inspired 
by the mixology of imaginative wizarding 
worlds.
Chelsea Rivera, Starbucks supervisor 
at Library West, said she is looking for-
ward to the new promotions.
“We’re getting close to Halloween, so 
this is a fun little promotion geared to-wards fall and the start of the new school year,” Rivera said.
Fear no more of just the basic pumpkin 
spice. These new drinks cater to anyone who enjoys hints of caramel, irish cream, butterscotch and more.
Golden Snitch, Exploding Lemonade, 
Polyjuice Potion and pumpkin juice are just a few of the seasonal drinks offered.
Prices range from $3 to $5 for all spe-
cialty iced drinks, hot drinks, frappuc-cinos and teas. The promotion will run through Oct. 31.
Some students waiting in line at Star-
bucks were creating hypothetical drinks with the new flavors.
“I would make a sorcerer’s stone po-
tion and bring Harry (Potter)’s parents back to life,” said 20-year-old UF psychol-ogy junior Taylor Schlussel.
Gator Dining Services and Starbucks 
are hosting a contest to encourage stu-
dents to try the new drinks. Students can 
get a punch card at any of the on-campus Starbucks locations when they buy a spe-cialty drink. Once the card is full, they can turn it in by Oct. 30 at 4:30 p.m. to any on-campus Starbucks. The winner of the drawing will receive $25 in dining declin-ing balance.Wizardly drinks this month

Tonight, the UF Symphony Orchestra will 
bring “The Story of Cinderella” to life with 
narration from Amy Redford, the daughter of Academy Award-winning film director and actor Robert Redford.
The orchestra will perform at 7:30 p.m. to-
night at the Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts and will feature pianist Andreas Klein in 
the first half of the performance.
Brenda Rieger, an orchestra manager, is 
grateful these artists from the music and en-tertainment industry chose to work with a university-level orchestra.
“It helps me personally realize the caliber 
and intricacy of our repertoire for this con-cert,” Rieger, a 21-year-old UF biology and psychology senior who plays the violin, wrote in an email.
For this concert, the 104-student orches-
tra includes more than just music majors. Students majoring in disciplines from archi-tecture to zoology are performing, said Ray-mond Chobaz, music director and conductor of the symphony orchestra.
Redford is in town to promote “The Gui-
tar,” a film that she directed about a cancer patient.
The Russian-themed concert will open 
with pieces featuring Klein, and “The Story of Cinderella” will follow, which features eight pieces from the ballet “Cinderella” by Sergei Prokofiev and guest artists from Dance Alive National Ballet.
Michael Blachly, director of the UFPA, said 
he wanted to give the orchestra “a higher pro-file to the student, faculty and surrounding 
community members” during National Arts 
and Humanities month, he wrote in an email.
“Every piece of music we play touches 
different chords in different people,” Chobaz said.  “Come and see if not a string in you gets touched.”Symphony presents Cinderella THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 9 8, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2014

A typical London street bustles with Muggles with 
their heads buried in their cellphones and newspapers. 
A purple double-decker is parked next to a glinting foun-tain and a cheery Jamaican voice chuckles from some-where inside. Most people miss the sign that marks the 
Leaky Cauldron. And most Muggles miss the entrance to 
Diagon Alley at Universal Studios.
Diagon Alley, which opened this summer, is the new-
est addition to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, connected from Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure by the Hogwarts Express. For those of you who are into the wizardry and witchiness of Halloween but not the terror and scares of Halloween Horror Nights, Diagon Alley is a perfect alternative.
The two stand-outs of the newest area of the wizard-
ing world are undoubtedly the ride Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts and the Hogwarts Express.
Under the 60-foot, ﬁ  re-breathing Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon, Gringotts stands in its blinding white marble, sturdy and encapsulating dragons, trolls and, in this ride, Lord Voldemort himself.
To get to the ride, you weave through hard-working 
goblins who ignore your very presence in the gold-ﬂ  aked, high-ceilinged queue area. On the ride itself, you go to set up a Gringotts account and meet Bill Weasley on the way. He takes you down 9 miles to the vaults, and you plunge down into the bowels of the earth, speeding past stalactites (or is it stalagmites?), dragons and waterfalls (don’t worry, he stops you from getting soaked) to follow Harry, Ron and Hermione (played by Daniel Radcliffe, 
Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) through their journey 
of breaking into the Lestrange’s vault. The 3D thrill ride has been the most popular ride in the park since Diagon Alley opened, but the wait is honestly worth it.
After all the excitement of almost being burned by that 
dragon, you’ll need a calm meander through the shops in Diagon Alley. There’s the staple Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands, where if you’re lucky, the shop owner will pick you for the wand-picking experience. There’s Wea-sley’s Wizard Wheezes and the Magical Menagerie, and you can creep through the dark Knockturn Alley (don’t forget to stop in Borgin and Burkes — and, are those 
shrunken heads singing?). Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream 
Parlour can treat you to some happiness in a bowl with Butterbeer ice cream, along with other ﬂ  avors specially made for the park.
Head back out to King’s Cross to catch the Hogwarts 
Express from Platform 9¾. You’ll need a two-park pass to get on the train, but you can upgrade in the station. After running through the column between platforms 9 and 10 (don’t worry, only the people behind you will see 
it), the wisened red Hogwarts Express emerges from bil-
lows of steam and your attendant leads you to your car. Don’t get caught up in your Muggle newspaper (the Al-ligator), though, because the rolling hills of England hold surprises as you travel to Hogsmeade.
You’ll run into beloved characters and see familliar 
scenes from the movies,. The Trolley Lady walks by, asking “Anything from the trolley, dears?” and just like Harry, you won’t want to return to the muggle world.

October in Florida is practically synonymous with 
Halloween Horror Nights season. For horror ﬁ  ends and 
fraidy cats alike, this year’s HHN is sure to inspire stress-induced sweating, a few chuckles and plenty of ear-pierc-ing screams.
You have no chance once you enter the park to pre-
pare yourself before you ﬁ  nd your way in the middle of the ﬁ  rst scare area: Bayou of Blood. You’ll be stalked by voodoo practitioners wearing bloodstained masks, just like you’re in the middle of the horror version of “Prin-cess and the Frog.” Nurses sell baggies full of blood along the paths as you cowardly make your way to and from the house. You’ll also encounter The Purge, with murder-ous, mask-wearing people who blend into the crowd way 
too well; Face-Off based on the creatures from the Sci-ﬁ   
show; and MASKerade Unstitched for the glamorous outﬁ  ts that are hiding gruesome secrets.
The biggest house this year is based off “The Walking Dead” — and by big, I don’t just mean the most popular (though it easily is the fan favorite). Horror Nights veter-ans will remember last year overpopulated with walkers, but they tweaked it around this time. The Walking Dead: End of the Line house is the largest Halloween Horror Night’s has ever had, double the size with three times as many scareactors. Minor spoiler alert ahead if you’re be-hind a season. The house is set up to walk you through the latest “Walking Dead” season, starting when Rick 
and the gang are splitting up following the Governor’s 
attack. Notice the walkers look a little different, with the eye-bleeds evidence of the deadly sickness plaguing sur-vivors. Keep your arms and legs close: There’s a horde coming your way with about 15 walkers confronting you. Don’t worry though, you’ll make it to Terminus soon enough.. or maybe worry about that.
Take a breather after that rotting-ﬂ  esh-ﬁ  lled night-
mare. Most of the rides in Universal Studios are still 
running at night. Or catch one of the shows: Bill & Ted’s 
Excellent Halloween Adventure, where you’ll laugh at pop culture events like #bendgate, and “The Rocky Hor-ror Picture Show,” with performers singing along to clips from the cult classic.
After that, jump back into the fray with a personal 
childhood fear of most 20-somethings that is brought to life in the Halloween house. Michael Myers lurks around every corner of the iconic house with his emotionless mask, ready to attack any and everyone with his butcher knife (or strangle you with a phone cable). Be warned, one room is ﬁ  lled with Michael’s... and not all of them are 
dummies.
There are houses for most types of fear: AVP for alien-
phobes; Dollhouse for the Damned for those who know 
dolls are the scariest childhood toy; Giggles and Gore Inc. for those who want to know where evil clowns come from (they’re made, not born); Roanoke - Cannibal Colony for the history buffs; and Dracula Untold and From Dusk till Dawn for fangbangers.
So, there’s that. Be prepared to scream (or laugh at the 
wimps) your way through the night.

A horse with six legs and a col-
laboration between downtown 
neighbors: The Hippodrome State Theatre is changing pace.  
“Getting rid of the old H, and 
trashing the tradition,” said Mark Sexton, the former general man-ager of the Hippodrome. “This is insane. This is the best thing ever!”
On Tuesday night, the 41-year-
old Hippodrome and local mar-keting team 160over90 revealed their strategy for a complete re-
branding of the historic theater, 
the ﬁ  rst one in about 20 years.
Before the reveal, Jessica Hu-
rov, managing director, said the Hippodrome was excited and extremely grateful for the chance to work with its neighbors. 160over90 collaborated and de-signed the rebranding completely free of charge.
The old design was drawn on 
a napkin by an old set designer.
“The swoopy H didn’t say 
anything about us. It was just a fancy H,” she said. “160over90 aims to use our marketing to tell a story.”
At the reveal, Greg Ash, the 
creative director at the ﬁ  rm that is also handling UF’s rebrand-ing, presented a minimalist logo: “Hippodrome” in a rectangular  box with the six-legged silhouette of a horse behind it.
The horse contains symbolic 
references to the theater’s past, 
present and future, Ash said. The 
horse is there because the original meaning of the word hippodrome involves horse racing, and the six legs represent the six founders, the six columns on the building and the six goals of the theater.
He said the point of the logo is 
to get people to ask questions. If 
the Hippodrome can use this logo to start a discussion in the com-
munity, then 160over90 has done its job.
“I can see this logo on a poster 
that says threesome on it,” Ash said in relation to a sample pro-duction poster for the play “Two Musketeers.”
Before the reveal, Ash said the 
idea for the rebranding came from conversations between himself, Hurov and other Hippodrome employees last October.
He said he believes the Hip-
podrome is the face of culture in Gainesville. The old building at the end of the street can be intimi-
dating and isn’t always appreci-
ated as it should be.
He said he wanted the rebrand 
to display a shift in perspective, make the community look inward, keep the dialogue going and help people be a little less afraid of the old building down the street.

Merengue musician Toño Rosario 
will be “kulikitakaing” his way to UF 
for Hispanic Heritage Month.
Máximo Antonio del Rosario, com-
monly known as Toño Rosario, will be 
performing at the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts at 7 p.m. Friday for UF’s Hispanic Heritage Month’s annual concert. Co-sponsored by Stu-dent Government Productions, the month long celebration hopes to get all 
UF students dancing out of their seats.
“We wanted to bring someone that 
made the Latino students feel nostal-gic and happy,” said Giselle Bermu-
dez, the executive director of Hispanic Heritage Month. “His music was very present in our childhood, and when I think of him, I think of the amazing house parties my family used to throw back in the day.”The 58-year-old Grammy-award 
nominee is known for his fast-paced, feel-good dance music popular in the Hispanic community but is most fa-mously known for his No. 1 hit single “Kulikitaka.”
“I keep telling all my Latino friends, 
‘if you weren’t raised on this song, 
your family didn’t do it right,’” Ber-
mudez, the 21-year-old UF sociology senior, said.
The popular Dominican artist 
blends both the old and the new wave of merengue, creating a genre for lis-teners of all generations to enjoy.
Now his performance is free at UF.“He’s a great choice, and I grew up 
around music like his,” said Yudelkis Fuste, a 20-year-old UF psychology ju-nior. “I’m excited to go Friday so I can not only support my friends, but the Hispanic community.”

After 14 years apart, Mineral has reunited. 
I was able to talk to Chris Simpson, the lead 
singer of the indie rock outﬁ  t, about how it felt to be playing again, what inﬂ  uenced the band and the future. Mineral will be playing 
at FEST on Nov. 2 at :08. Its set is at 10:30 
p.m., and it’ll be the ﬁ  rst show together in Florida in 16 years. 
What inspired you guys to get back to-
gether? What events took place to get a tour going?
I think, in general sense, I started thinking 
about it — just the fact that it was 20 years since 
we started the band, so that number sort of fac-
tored into that. I was thinking that if there was a time do something, now would be a good one, you know? And then Jim Adkins from Jimmy Eat World — I was hanging out with him last fall, and we were sort of both talking about how it’s been 20 years since we started our bands. He ended up asking if we might consider doing a show with them and some other bands, a sort of 20th anniversary show, 
and I hadn’t talked to the other guys about it. 
So I talked to everyone else and see if they’d at least be interested in getting together in the rehearsal room and seeing what happens, you know? So it’s really like we just kind of agreed to get together and see how it felt — or see if we could feel it out and see if it was something we’d be interested in doing. But at the time we were thinking about doing one show, then it 
just kinda grew from there. We ate breakfast 
and started getting back into the material and started getting reconnected with one another again. It was kind of time in all of our lives where a lot of us were in transitional phases between different things we were doing work-wise and schoolwise and familywise and what not, so it just sort of worked out — like all sys-tems go. So we have a good friend who’s been hassling us for a while about doing something with Mineral. They’re sort of involved in the 
music world, and they offered to manage the 
affair and put things together for us. So we green lighted it, and it kinda blew up.
Twenty years ago is this something you 
ever thought your band would do?
Deﬁ  nitely not — although 20 years ago, I 
probably thought we’d still be around. Which I guess we are, but in a different way than I would’ve imagined at that time. I was very 
much career minded at the time. I didn’t re-
ally see any reason why Mineral wouldn’t be around now.
Do you think this reunion will inspire 
new music from Mineral?
That’s been a popular question for sure. I think our take on it has been that we’re cer-tainly open to it, but there’s no speciﬁ  c plans in the work. I think that’s something that would take a little more time to develop. As of right now, we kind of we have our hands full just 
getting ready for the tour, preparing and re-
learning the material and all learning the gear, the technical aspect together. I think we have the next leg of the tour to be addressed, and then we have quite a while off before we got off to Europe and Japan in January. So I guess we’ll see what happens. We’re deﬁ  nitely not closed minded to the idea. Nobody is think-ing that we should deﬁ  nitely not do that. Like 
I said, there’s just no plan other than the tour 
dates we have planned right now.

website.

Thousands of pink ribbons 
hanging in store windows, 
pinned onto pedestrians’ 
chest pockets and printed 
on campus ﬂ  iers mean only 
one thing: Pinktober is in full swing.
October, or Pinktober, is 
Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which is an annual campaign to increase aware-ness of the disease and lives affected.
“I think it’s important for 
all young people, men and women, to be aware of breast cancer, the warning signs and what to look out for,” said 
Yenisse Soto, missions and 
marketing manager of the Su-san G. Komen Miami/Ft. Lau-
derdale Afﬁ  liate.
Soto said it’s important 
students ﬁ  nd ways to get 
involved, whether through small donations or actively participating in an event.
Some UF organizations 
and Gainesville businesses are also hosting events to raise awareness within the commu-
nity. There are several ways 
students can get involved di-rectly and indirectly with the 
campaign this year.  
Students can indi-
rectly participate in 
breast cancer aware-ness at any Tijuana 
Flats restaurant. The 
company, known for its fresh ingredients and crazy taco deals, allows 
customers to order pink tacos 
for an additional $1 to support the cause. 
Customers can also pur-
chase a $5 bottle of “The Sauce That Saves,” and the money will be donated to breast can-cer research.
“This is the second year 
we’ve been doing the pink ta-cos, (and) I believe this is the 10th year we’ve been doing fundraising for breast cancer,” said Juan Segura, manager of the Tijuana Flats on Univer-sity Avenue. 
“Last year it was a pretty 
big success. We donated over $250,000 as a company in one month,” he said. “This year 
we’re looking to in-crease that number.”
Besides the vivid 
pink tacos and spicy hot sauce, customers 
can come in and sign 
the survivor wall, which is dedicated 
to individuals who have sur-
vived any form of cancer over 
the years.
“All the stores are doing it 
— it’s pretty cool. It’s liberat-
ing putting someone’s name 
up there,” Segura said.  
Segura said customers who 
do not donate can still put a name on the wall. 
All Tijuana Flats locations 
will have this promotion go-ing until Oct. 26.  Pinktober awareness takes overcultureBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

With quarterback Treon Har-
ris indefinitely suspended from 
team activities while he is investi-gated for alleged sexual battery, Jeff Driskel will be Florida’s starter on 
Saturday when UF (3-1, 2-1 South-
eastern Conference) plays host to LSU (4-2, 0-2 SEC) at 7:30 p.m.While coach Will Muschamp 
knew Driskel was going to have time on the field against the Tigers, he did not have a starter selected between Driskel and Harris head-ing into the week.
“Jeff was going to play in the 
game,” Muschamp said. “I do 
know that.”
Driskel was benched in favor of 
Harris with eight seconds remain-ing in the third quarter of Florida’s 
10-9 win against Tennessee. 
Harris led UF’s offense on both 
of its scoring drives, and Driskel finished the day against the Volun-teers completing 11 of his 23 passes for 59 yards while throwing three interceptions.
“Jeff’s a tough young man. 
He’s resilient,” Muschamp said. “I met with him Sunday and I talked to him after the game and talked to him Monday. He understands there’s some situation. He needs to play better. He takes full responsi-bility to be the quarterback at the University of Florida.”
But now the focus has shifted 
from who will start against LSU to 
who will be Driskel’s backup.
Muschamp said Wednesday 
that redshirt sophomore Skyler 
Mornhinweg and true freshman Will Grier are splitting the second-team reps in practice this week.
Grier is a four-star recruit out of 
Davidson Day (N.C.) High and the 
second-ranked dual-threat quar-
terback in the 2014 recruiting class, according to Rivals.com. He tallied 90 total touchdowns and more than 6,000 total yards in his senior year of high school alone.
Grier missed three weeks of 
practice with back spasms but was cleared to practice again on Sun-
day.
“I didn’t see a lot of rust from 
him as far as those things,” Mus-
champ said of Grier. “He’s been in-volved in all the meetings.”
Muschamp admitted Wednes-
day that he had thoughts about red-shirting Grier but the discussions did not go too far.
“We hadn’t really made a de-
cision considering the length we still had to go in the season,” Mus-champ said. “So, you know, we had not had that discussion as far as redshirt at that time. Given the situation of having two guys that had played to that point in the sea-son, that’s probably where we were headed. Certainly given the situa-tion right now, obviously not.”
Mornhinweg started Florida’s 
final three games of the 2013 season following season-ending injuries 
to Driskel and then-backup Tyler 
Murphy.
In those three games, the Phila-
delphia native recorded 344 yards, three touchdowns and an intercep-tion while completing 69.8 percent of his passes.
Mornhinweg and freshman de-
fensive lineman Gerald Willis were 
in an altercation involving a pair 
of cleats Monday evening that re-sulted in University Police being dispatched.
Neither player pressed charges, 
and Muschamp clarified the inci-dent on Wednesday and said that the two are not receiving disciplin-ary action.
“It was a tremendous misunder-
standing,” Muschamp said. “I tell you what, we’ve made a big one out of this. We’ve got an air thing that takes the wetness out of the cleats. Skyler last year was No. 17 and Jor-dan Sherit’s No. 17 this year. Gerald was coming from class and trying to get ready for practice. Couldn’t 
find his cleats on the air thing, and 
he grabbed No. 17 because he’s buddies with Jordan Sherit and he thought that’d be OK. Went out to practice, and there was a disagree-ment on the cleats and whose cleats they were.
“Nobody stole anything. If any-
body stole anything, they wouldn’t 
be on this football team anymore. I 
can assure you of that.”

Coming off of an embarrassing perfor-
mance at the hands of the Crimson Tide the 
Gators needed an outstanding defensive per-formance, and they got one all around.
From the defensive side of the ball, Florida 
produced six sacks and allowed the Volun-teers only 233 yards. 
They were so good no individual on the 
unit was even given the game ball, instead the whole unit got the honor, an honor bestowed on an all-around good effort.
“We felt like from a front standpoint we 
had some guys who could rush and get pres-sure with four,” Muschamp said. “We were 
able to do so. We covered well on the back 
end. There were so many positives. Within each group we had some guys that had pro-ductive days. Bryan Cox had a great day, Jalen Tabor for a freshman — for any player — had an outstanding game.”
Muschamp highlighted 
Marcus Maye, singling 
him out as playing the best 
game he’s had all year, then applauded both Maye and Jabari Gorman for their play on special teams, giv-
ing them special teams player of the game as well as kicker Austin Hardin.
Muschamp said they communicated well 
— a struggle during the Alabama game — and executed their assignments much better. This could be from having with extra time during the bye week to prepare for Tennessee and to go back to basics. 
The Gators also stripped away some of the checks that are usually made at the line of scrimmage by the secondary to reduce confu-sion and allow players to play fast without thinking, only reacting.
Injury update: Receiver Valdez Showers is 
the only player confirmed that is out for the LSU game. 
Defensive lineman Leon Orr is questionable 
for Saturday’s game against LSU with a knee injury, with Muschamp saying he’s worked out, and continues to progress. Linebacker Mike Taylor has resolved his knee injury but contracted the flu, but is still expected to play. 
Receiver CJ Worton has recovered from 
sustaining a broken hand and will play Sat-urday. Quarterback Will Grier is good to go after being cleared by trainers for having back spasm, as are running backs Brandon Powell and Matt Jones.
Muschamp assesses offensive line: After any absence rust becomes a factor for players, and it can take different amounts of time to return to game speed. This is the case for left tackle D.J. Humphries.
“He and I talked after the game,” Mus-
champ said. “That’s one thing about D.J., he’s a hard self-evaluator and came to me and said, ‘boy, we need to tighten some things up.’ He’ll get back into the swing. I’ve been pleased with his practice so far this week.”
Besides Humphries, Muschamp said fresh-
man Roderick Johnson continues to get better although he did get beat on a stunt in a critical situation. 
Fellow-freshman lineman David Sharpe 
was also mentioned as someone the coach-ing staff is comfortable with moving forward. Center Max Garcia was the offensive lineman of the game and continues to have “an amaz-ing year” according to Muschamp.

By now, Florida’s volleyball team is 
tired of hearing about Chloe Mann.
Or rather, about her absence.
Mann was a two-time All-American 
and led UF in hitting percentage for three 
straight years, beginning in her sopho-more season.
She was No. 1 on the team in both kills 
and points as a senior, and was a large part of Florida’s 28-4 record last season and second place ﬁ  nish in the Southeast-ern Conference.
She was Florida’s unquestioned leader 
at the net.
And now she’s gone, but she left some-
thing behind.
“Towards the end, (Chloe) kind of 
knew it was gonna be me (replacing her),” junior Simone Antwi said. “So it wasn’t that drastic of a transition because Chloe kind of eased me into it towards the end 
of the season.”
Antwi has inherited Mann’s role as the 
team’s oldest blocker.
And just as Mann helped her, Antwi is 
now facilitating freshman blocker Rhamat 
Alhassan’s transition into Florida’s sys-tem.
So far, the junior has set a good exam-
ple.Antwi is fourth in the SEC in hitting 
percentage (.398), and of the conference’s top 20 hitters, she has the fourth fewest er-
rors (26).
The 6-foot-2 blocker not only takes 
pride in her own ability, but also in the 
help she is able to provide Alhassan.“It’s weird now because I’m the oldest 
middle, so I have to kind of be the mama bear,” Antwi said. “When Rhamat’s in (the 
game) and she does something, it’s not like 
I can go out of the game and just check out. I have to pay attention and see what she’s doing. ... I’ve kind of embraced the role of helping her.”
Antwi’s mentorship has allowed Alhas-
san to ﬂ  ourish beyond expectations during 
her ﬁ  rst season. 
The freshman has surpassed Antwi in 
hitting percentage (.476) while collecting 
just one more error (27).
For Antwi and Alhassan, the distinc-
tion between junior and freshman is clear. The line between student and teacher is less so.
“She’s helped me more than she knows, 
to be honest,” Antwi said.
After not starting to begin the year, Al-
hassan has now secured a permanent spot in the opening lineup.
“Who would of thought that a player 
who didn’t start the ﬁ  rst set of her ﬁ  rst match of her freshmen year can produce the kind of numbers that Rhamat is pro-ducing right now?” coach Mary Wise 
said.
Some of Alhassan’s success is a direct 
result of Antwi’s assistance, but even more 
of it is due to the precedent that Mann set during her Florida tenure.
Mann’s gone now, but she left some-
thing behind.
“Chloe, having her around was a really 
big thing, but she also kind of helped us 
along the way,” Antwi said. “While she 
was here … (I) learned so much from her. Now we’re kind of carrying it on for her.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 9, 2014

Muschamp met with media Wednesday for ﬁ  rst time this week
handled the sexual assault accusa-
tions vary.
“I’m proud of the way Florida 
handled it,” said 20-year-old Con-
nor Ingalls. “I think it was good for 
them to take care of it before it got out of control or overshadowed the team.”
The telecommunication junior 
said he thinks the university’s de-
cision to suspend Harris is strong-
ly inﬂ  uenced by the recent assaults on and around UF campus.
“It all created the perfect storm 
really for Treon Harris to just have to be suspended immediately,” he said.
However, 23-year-old recent 
Florida State University graduate 
David Arbogast said he doesn’t 
agree with Harris’ suspension.
“I don’t think we should pun-
ish someone until they’re proven guilty, but I understand why UF did it,” he said.Coach Will Muschamp met 
with media on Wednesday for the ﬁ  rst time since news about Harris’ 
situation broke on Monday.
The Florida head coach did not 
add any further comment on the situation.
“The statement that the uni-
versity released Monday, I think, was pretty self-explanatory,” Mus-
champ said. 
“It’s a very serious charge, and 
there’s been no change in his sta-tus. So that’s kind of where we are.”
