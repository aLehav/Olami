Adam Samei’s eyes darted 
across a ﬂ  ood of unfamiliar 
faces. He walked along the sidewalk near the University Auditorium, searching the buildings to ﬁ  nd a landmark he recognized.
He stopped.“Where am I?” the 18-year-
old asked under his breath, twisting his neck around.
Samei walked another 
block and stopped again.
“This is the wrong way,” he 
said, sounding unsure.
Samei decided to follow a 
group of people walking to-ward Turlington Plaza and found himself at the Hub, his intended destination.
More than 6,000 freshmen 
began their ﬁ  rst Fall semes-ter at the university Wednes-day. They joined the masses

Samei, who plans to dou-

On the ﬁ  rst day of school, 
Samei gave himself plenty of time before class, in case he got lost — which he did.
He accidentally walked 
into an Italian class in Mather-ly Hall instead of his sched-uled First Year Florida course. Samei asked the professor to let him sign onto ISIS on the university-owned computer to ﬁ  nd the right room.
“It was a computer error,”

UF students and Gainesville community 
members can learn about and discuss the 
university’s presidential search at several public meetings Friday.
The university will host an open forum from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the Presidents Room of Emerson Alumni Hall to discuss what type of qualities the next UF president should have. Attendees can give their input regarding UF’s character and accomplish-ments and its future president.
Also that day, two focus groups composed 
of previously selected faculty members and students will meet at 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. re-
spectively in the Presidents Room. Anyone 
interested may sit in on the sessions to listen, according to a university press release.
For those who can’t attend, the confer-
ences will be live-streamed online, which can be accessed via www.presidentialsearch.uﬂ  .edu. Earlier this month, the search com-mittee accepted comments regarding the 
questions via email.
An administrative subcommittee will 
meet Monday to consider reports from Fri-

UF was repeatedly recognized in 
this year’s Princeton Review rank-ings. The university placed in nine of the 62 categories featured in the book “The Best 377 Colleges, 2013 
Edition.”
The Princeton Review also 
ranked UF as No. 8 in “Best College 
Newspaper” and No. 19 for “Stu-dents Study the Least.”
The rankings derive from 122,000 
student surveys, which averages to about 324 students per campus. 
But UF takes its rankings with a 
grain of salt.
“We tend to focus on more ob-
jective measures,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando said, adding that the rankings do not represent the university’s hardworking and well-prepared students. 
However, UF has a reputation, as 
evidenced by its No. 1 party school

O’Mara said the Facebook

it also allowed for discussions

When it comes to books, everyone 
is looking for a bargain.
Students in line wound through 
the aisles of the UF Bookstore on 
Wednesday, their arms heavy with textbooks as they took advantage of discounted prices. 
For some, the reward was worth 
the wait — all new and used text-books were discounted by 7 percent.
This beginning-of-semester scene 
is not uncommon. 
Book prices can differ among 
stores, which means many students shop around, hunting for deals and visiting several places before mak-
ing a purchase.
On Wednesday, 29-year-old busi-
ness management junior Djino Ag-
enor was one of them.
“I’m seeing which ones are 
cheaper, better,” Agenor said while browsing for marketing books.Psychology sophomore Stacy 
Robinson, 20, checked the UF Book-
store first for used copies of the biol-
ogy textbook she needed. When she found none in stock, she headed to the Florida Bookstore.
But microbiology junior Jon Fos-
ter said he didn’t even try the UF Bookstore for his organic chemistry lab book. The 20-year-old thought prices would be higher there.
Still, others opted for conve-
nience.
Applied physiology and kinesiol-
ogy junior Barnes Lerebours, 20, said 
he hadn’t heard about the sale. He 
was already on campus and figured he should start buying books.
“My teachers were on me,” Lere-
bours said.

� HE ALLEGEDLY THREATENED 
HIS GIRLFRIEND WITH A KNIFE.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
Gainesville Police arrested a man ear -
ly Wednesday morning after he chased 
his girlfriend out of her second-story window and held onto her car roof as she drove away.
At about 1:30 a.m., Towshanda Hill’s 
boyfriend, Allen Lenard Nelson, arrived at her house, 2542 SW 31st Place, want-ing to borrow her car.
According to a GPD arrest report, 
Hill, 28, and Nelson, 32, started arguing about their relationship. 
The couple fought for about an hour, 
mainly about “ignorant” stuff, Hill said 
Wednesday afternoon. 
Hill went to the bathroom upstairs. 
When she came out, she said, she saw 
Nelson holding a knife behind his back at the bottom of the stairs.
According to the report, Nelson pre-
tended he was going to throw the knife, and Hill fled to her room. As Nelson kicked down the door, she jumped from 
her window and ran to her car.
She locked her car doors as Nelson 
followed her outside. He climbed onto 
the car roof and started yelling at her.Hill said she backed out of the park-
ing lot and drove east on Southwest 31st Place as Nelson clung to the roof, scream-ing for help.
As she turned onto Southwest 23rd 
Terrace, Nelson fell off the car roof. Hill called police from a friend’s house.
A witness said she and her husband 
heard screaming and called police after seeing a man, presumably Nelson, hang-ing onto a car roof as it sped down the road.
The woman, who did not want her 
name published, said she and her hus-band saw the man again as he ran down the street across from their house.
Police later arrived at Hill’s house 
and thought Nelson barricaded himself inside, said GPD spokeswoman Cpl. An-gelina Valuri.
Officers from the GPD Criminal In-
vestigation Division, SWAT team and Negotiation Response Team responded to the call.
Police questioned Hill to find Nelson, 
who lives at 803 SE 12th Ave., where he was later arrested.
Nelson was charged with aggravated 
assault with a weapon and booked into Alachua County Jail at 10:01 a.m.
As of Wednesday night, Nelson re-
mained in jail. A bond had not been set.

“Ultimately, they’re just trying to make sure 
they’ve addressed the desired qualifications in everybody’s issues,” Sikes said. “All the con-
stituents.”
The Qualifications and Criteria Subcommit-
tee met Wednesday to talk about the language 
in the document. The subcommittee discussed including, as desired traits in an applicant, ex-perience in an administrative leadership posi-tion at a major university and fluency in a sec-ond language. 
Members of the subcommittee did not want 
the criteria to dissuade qualified applicants from pursuing the job. The subcommittee changed the introduction to the criteria to include that “the university will consider candidates both within and outside academia.”
After the subcommittee finalizes its criteria 
Monday, the document will be submitted to the 
overall search committee and UF Board of Trustees Commit-tee on Governance for approv-al at a joint Tuesday meeting.
As for Friday, the three 
main topics will be:
•What are the unique qual-
ities and notable strengths of UF?
• What are UF’s opportu-
nities and impacts in academics, research and service for the future?
• Based on these inquiries, what qualities and 
experience are needed for UF’s next leader?

He takes academics seriously. Samei graduated 
from high school with a 4.5 GPA and said he for -
bids himself from letting his UF GPA slip below 
a 3.8.
Throughout the next four years, Samei hopes to 
join a fraternity and get more involved with Stu-dent Government. After that, he plans to pursue a master’s degree and attend law school.
But for now, he would be happy just to find his 
Statistics class.

At 2 p.m. Wednesday, Alex Solomon welcomed 
the first day of class with beer and barbecue.
The 22-year-old aerospace engineering senior 
placed his tray of leftover Sonny’s and an un-opened 24-pack of eight-ounce Coors Light on his coffee table. He was wearing the same tank top he slept in. His 11:45 a.m. class hadn’t seemed worth walking to when it looked like it might rain.
“I actually did the math,” Solomon said while 
cracking open a drink. “This is more alcohol per dollar than an 18-pack of regular cans.”
He paused the explanation to chase his morn-
ing vitamin regimen with more beer, which he calls “the fuel that gets me running at maximum effi-ciency.”
“Also,” he added, “it’s easier to chug.”Solomon’s roommate appeared not long after 
he finished his first beer. The pair decided to go to Salty Dog Saloon before Solomon’s 4 p.m. class.
The day continued, and Solomon mused about 
starting his final year of college as he walked to Midtown.
“I’m looking forward to football season,” he 
said. “But I couldn’t get tickets because I’m only taking seven credits.”
When it was time for class, Solomon found a 
seat in the back of his lecture in the Florida Gym. There, he used the distance from the professor to his advantage.
Solomon played Bubble Shooter on his iPhone, 
checked his Facebook page and looked up periodi-cally to watch the video the professor was show-ing.
It wasn’t a bad first day for a man with only 
three days of class a week.
“Four years ago, you couldn’t have told me I’d 
be in Salty Dog at 3 p.m. drinking a pitcher,” he said. “It’s ideal that the bars are closer to my house than classes are.”

“We’re aware there are issues that

UF came in with several sports-
related rankings, including No. 2 in “Jock Schools,” No. 3 in “Students Pack the Stadiums” and No. 16 in “Everyone Plays Intramural Sports.”
Marty Dempsey , a coordinator for 
competitive sports at RecSports, said the organization takes pride in its ranking. 
However, Dempsey said the rank-
ing isn’t necessarily a good represen-tation of UF’s intramural numbers. Be-tween 12,000 and 15,000 students play intramural sports at UF each school year, a small sample size, he said.Robert Franek, author of the book, 
said it is not uncommon for larger campuses like UF to generate thou-sands of survey responses. 
The book and rankings reflect data 
collected throughout the past three years. Generally , the survey results remain consistent, Franek said. But there are fluctuations on the list.
For example, UF’s career resource 
services were ranked No. 6 this year. Last year, they pulled in the top spot, and in 2011 they were ranked No. 4, according to Alligator archives.
Although the university may not 
agree with these rankings, Franek maintained they are accurate.
“They are based on that expert 
opinion,” he said. “And that expert opinion being current college stu-dents.”

OPINIONS EDITORLegitimate Rape?
Todd Akin fails at 
science
Can you remember the last time you heard about Mis-
souri? It’s just one of those lonely, forgotten fly-over states — until last week.
Rep. Todd Akin stuck his Midwestern foot in his Midwest-
ern mouth when he tried to express his opinion about a St. 
Louis television station.
He seemed to think that women rarely get pregnant via 
rape.
“If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try 
to shut that whole thing down,” Akin said.
Oh!
Phew, what a relief.Y’know, maybe that’s why most conservatives are against 
birth control and contraception: They must think that it’s al-
most unnecessary. We women are apparently in much more 
control of our bodies than science originally taught us.
We can just wish ourselves sterile at will, right?Wrong.Akin’s comments on women’s health issues are troubling.Other anti-abortion enthusiasts maintain that women 
“secrete” something during the act of rape to prevent preg-nancy.
These are our elected officials? Men who believe there is 
mythical magic inside wombs?
Akin has since apologized for his controversial comments 
and was probably also taught a quick biology lesson before appearing on popular conservative radio and TV shows.
While Sean Hannity called for Akin to drop out of his Sen-
ate race on TV, Mike Huckabee provided some sort of sanctu-ary on his radio show.
Somehow, through all of this, Huckabee became a beacon 
of journalism and the go-to place for interviews with the “no-
dude-left-behind/two-wrongs-don’t-make-a-right” repre-
sentative.
“Rape is never legitimate,” Akin said to Huckabee. “I used 
the wrong words in the wrong way.”
He also said he would win this race “by the grace of 
God.”
Listen, pal. Let’s not bring God into this, because one of us 
won’t be happy with what God has to say on the matter.
Akin might still stand a chance in his Senate race despite 
his gaffe-a-thon on Sunday, and that should be alarming.
Are Missouri voters OK with his stance on anti-abortion 
versus pro-abortion rights issues? It’s possible. Missouri is a notorious swing state.
But we’d hope voters would find a problem with voting to 
elect someone who is so tragically misinformed about basic biology. The things he said were reprehensible and insulting to the American public and to all women.
Our congressional representatives should have a grasp on 
reality, not on a science that is loosely based on nothing.
Kudos to Huckabee for snagging the scoop on this brush-
fire of a political gaffe. All that Chick-fil-A must be brain food.IBC director’s negative review shows carelessness
For many students, the Institute of Black Culture 
was just a landmark on the UF map. 
However, after John Johnson was hired as the 
IBC director, things changed dramatically for black stu-
dents. IBC became appreciated for its historical value and relevance as a home for the black community.
Under Johnson’s directorship, the IBC coordinated 
a number of exceptional and engaging programs. He 
organized meetings and retreats for student leaders on 
campus to help them better serve their unique audi-ences. 
He spent many hours in the office planning events 
like the Black Student Leadership Conference, which did a phenomenal job of promoting professionalism, etiquette and networking skills. His commitment to IBC promoted much more traffic and opportunity to uplift in the community.
Johnson did not just do his job — he made himself 
physically, mentally and emotionally available to stu-dents. Conversations with him inspired in students new perspectives, love for their identities and histories, and pride in being a scholar. Under his leadership, the IBC 
became a sanctuary for intellectual growth and minor-
ity unification.
Despite his many triumphs and recommendation 
letters lauding his wonderful performance sent to his 
superiors, Johnson received a negative performance 
evaluation after his first six months on the job. Feeling underappreciated, Johnson sought employment else-where and resigned from his position as IBC director. 
No effort was made by the UF administration to sup-
port Johnson while he was here or when he made him-self available for negotiation after receiving a job offer from another institution.
News of his leaving caused much frustration and an-
ger in the hearts of many students, but it also raised some questions: What is the process for evaluating staff and faculty at UF? Did the administration consult students — those affected 
most by Johnson’s leader-
ship? Does the administra-
tion understand the influence his position had on the community?
It seems that his evaluation and subsequent depar-
ture were treated like business as usual, and student voices were ignored. But under no circumstances will this be swept under the rug.
To avoid any confusion, Johnson explained that he 
was leaving UF after 11 months of work “because his work conditions were not affirming.” 
He loved his job and the people he served enough 
to occasionally clock 50 or even 60 hours in a week to 
make a difference.
I cannot understand why this talented professional 
was negatively assessed or why nobody made an effort 
to keep such a valued community resource.
This happened because UF’s Division of Student Af-
fairs, and Multicultural and Diversity Affairs in particu-lar, operate with impunity and have no one to answer to when making decisions about how best to support underserved communities.
So starting today, I think we must hold Multicultural 
and Diversity Affairs and the Division of Student Af-fairs accountable.
We must demand that these questions be answered 
and changes be made to prevent a similar loss from hap-
pening again.
We will not acquiesce.
We will be loud about our position on the matter un-
til there is change.

On a sweltering summer day 
in Gainesville, a tall glass of this 
blueberry-lavender lemonade is 
simultaneously tart, sweet and 
instantly refreshing.
Normally, lemonade is made 
with only three humble ingre-
dients: sugar, water and freshly 
squeezed lemon juice (don’t even think about using Country Time). In this version, the water is in-fused with fresh lavender sprigs, 
and blueberry puree is added for 
a fruity kick.
Although it’s the end of Au-
gust, there’s still time to enjoy a 
summer cocktail. So try adding a 
shot of gin or vodka to your glass. There’s nothing like an ice-cold glass of lemonade on a hot day!

 7 ½ cups water, divided
 1 cup lemon juice, freshly 
squeezed (about 5 to 6 lem-ons) 1 pint blueberries
 15 sprigs fresh lavender (1 
small plant) and a few extra for garnishDirections:
1. In a saucepan, boil 2 cups 
of sugar and 2 cups of water. Stir until the sugar dissolves.
2. Remove the mixture from 
the heat, add fresh lavender sprigs, and cover it. Let it seep for 30 minutes, then remove the sprigs from the saucepan and 
discard them.
3. In a bowl, crush the 
blueberries until they become a 
puree. You can also puree them 
in a blender or a food processor.
4. You can do this next step 
two ways: (1) Place the blueberry 
puree in a fine-mesh sieve positioned over a pitcher. Pour 
lavender-infused water through 
the sieve on top of the blueberry puree and into the pitcher. (2) Place the lavender-infused water 
and blueberry puree in a French 
press. Press down to create a very clear blueberry-lavender mixture.
5. Pour the lemon juice into a 
pitcher, followed by 5 1/2 cups of water. Tip: taste the lemonade between adding cups of water — some like it tart! You can also 
add more sugar or lemon juice at 
this step.
6. Stir well, and garnish with 
a sprig of lavender, floating blueberries, or a lemon slice on the edge of the glass. Enjoy!

Now that the Merriam-Webster’s Colle-
giate Dictionary has been updated, words like 
brain cramp, man cave and sexting are fair game for academic papers.
Here are some highlights from the list, 
punctuated by two students using the words in a hypothetical conversation:
Aha moment n (1939): a moment of sudden 
realization, inspiration, insight, recognition, or comprehension
“I had this aha moment in class today . The 
girl who sits next to me took off her glasses and she was like, hot.” 
“Sexy librarian?”“Aw yeah. I’m going to ask her out.”
Brain cramp n (1982): an instance of tempo-
rary mental confusion resulting in an error or 
lapse of judgment“Meet me at the French Fries at one?” “No one says that.”“Oh, sorry. Total brain cramp.”
Craft beer n (1986): a specialty beer pro-
duced in limited quantities: microbrew
“So is she in your next class?” 
“Yeah, but I drank a lot of craft beer last 
night, so I'm too hung over to talk to her.”
Energy drink n (1904): a usually carbon-
ated beverage that typically contains caffeine intended to increase the drinker’s energy
“Maybe this energy drink will help.”
F-bomb n (1988): the word f--k — used 
metaphorically as a euphemism
“How’d it go?” 
“I started to ask for her name, but the en-
ergy drink and hangover combo turned on 
me. I dropped an f-bomb and ran to the bath-
room.”
"Ouch." Flexitarian n (1998): one whose normally 
meatless diet occasionally includes meat or fish
“So I finally asked her out. She said she’s a 
flexitarian, so I’ve got to take her somewhere versatile.”
Game changer n  (1993): a newly intro-
duced element or factor that changes an existing situa-tion or activity in a signifi-
cant way
“I’ve got a total game 
changer: CiCi’s. It has some-
thing for everyone.”
Man Cave n (1992): a 
room or space designed according to the taste of the man of the house to be used as his per -
sonal area for hobbies and leisure activities
“So I took that girl out. I brought her to 
CiCi’s then took her back to my man cave to chill, but she hasn’t talked to me since.”
“I don’t know where you went wrong.”Obesogenic adj (1986):  promoting exces-
sive weight gain:  producing obesity
“Oh, she just texted me. She called me obe-
sogenic for taking her to CiCi’s.” 
“Come on! It has salad.”
Sexting n (2007): the sending of sexually 
explicit messages or images by cellphone
“Bro, what happened last night?"
“You started sexting sexy librarian girl.”“For real? Sweet.”
Tipping point n (1959): the critical point in 
a situation, process, or system beyond which 
a significant and often unstoppable effect or change takes place
“So I saw her by the French Fries.”“Stop trying to make French Fries hap-
pen.” 
“Whatever man. Anyway, it must have 
been the tipping point because she slapped me and made me drop my Chick-fil-A.” 
“I guess she wasn’t feeling meat today .” “Typical flexitarian.”Merriam-Webster includes 'sexting,' 'f-bomb' in dictionaryMICHELLE PROVENZANO

The sight of bearded men, 
indie-clad in all their glory, can 
only mean one thing: a staple ap-
pearance by Manchester Orchestra 
right here in Gainesville.
Manchester Orchestra is 
set to perform its first show in Gainesville at High Dive (formerly 
Double Down Live) tonight at 8 
p.m. Tickets are $19 with an addi-
tional $2 charge at the door for fans 
younger than 21 years old.
With three albums under its 
belt, Manchester Orchestra has 
gone through many changes throughout the years, from work-ing on solo projects to getting new 
members.
“We added a new drummer 
after ‘Mean Everything to Noth-
ing,’” said Chris Freeman, key-board and percussion enthusiast 
of Manchester Orchestra. “That 
changed our dynamic a little bit, 
because he’s a hard-hitting, very 
large, bearded man who is kind of 
scary behind the drum set. So he 
sort of revitalizes us and makes us 
more energetic.”
 Freeman said he and the band 
have tried to balance out the set list 
as much as they can to cover a va-
riety of songs on their three-album 
discography, but usually stick to 
the songs that they can remember playing and ones that are typically 
crowd pleasers.
 “‘Pensacola’ is a favorite, be-
cause it’s a good song for the crowd to be able to sing along with. So it’s always fun just to scream that one out,” Freeman said.
 What Gainesville fans can ex-pect from tonight’s show are loud 
performances and possibly a few 
solo songs by the band’s lead sing-
er, Andy Hull. As for new material since last year’s “Simple Math,” it’s looking to be an unlikely sight.
 “We have been working on 
new material for the past couple 
months, and we built a studio in 
Atlanta where we’ve been work-
ing and hashing some songs out,” Freeman said. “But I’m not quite sure they’re ready to be played 
live yet.”
 Gainesville fans have noth-
ing to worry about regardless of 
whether the band performs new material, because the band’s man-
tra is to be as loud as possible and 
play the best show they can have, 
Freeman said.
  Attendees can expect a lot of 
loud guitars and copious amounts 
of energy, stemming from the 
band’s hiatus from the tour world.
In addition to the front-running 
band, the show will feature two 
opening acts: River City Extension 
and Chris Staples.
  Excitement streaming from 
both ends of the spectrum — the fans and the band — there is seem-
ingly nothing that can bring this 
show down.
 “I think people are really appre-
ciative because not a lot of bands go to play colleges,” Freeman said. 
“It’s fun to be in the college town atmosphere because none of us 
ever went to college. So we get to 
play around, go a little wild and have fun with the locals.”THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� A NEW SYSTEM FOR DROP/ADD 
COULD DECREASE ISIS FUSTRATION. 
IAN ROWE
Avenue Writer
For the past several hours, I’ve been star -
ing at the drop/add page on my computer 
screen the way a drunk person watches the 
rotation of a gas station hot dog: with a mix-
ture of hunger and disgust. Not five minutes goes by before I reclick the page’s refresh button, only to find myself seconds later 
cursing the heavens and shouting, “Buddha, 
Jesus, Athena! WHY!?,”  knowing full well that somewhere in Gainesville, at that exact moment, some jerk is laughing because he has the class I want, and he knows it.
There are a number of reasons why I’m 
in this quandary. The first: The organiza-tion of the registration dates is unfair to all students. The second: There’s too many 
students and not enough classes. The third: 
I “forgot” when my registration date was, went “backpacking” across the United States and didn’t “register” until I got back to Gainesville “last week.” And while there’s a higher likelihood it’s the third reason, let’s 
not forget that this is an election year, and 
so I elect to forgo any responsibility for my actions. Instead, I opt to propose ideas be-yond any logical person’s comprehension. Like this one:
We should retract the drop/add scav-
enger hunt approach, and instead institute drop/add elimination. To keep up with the media’s dystopic trends (with films like 
“The Hunger Games” and NBC’s new show 
“Revolution”), instead of students sitting in chairs waiting for their classes to appear, we should assemble the students who have signed up for said classes and set them loose 
against each other in a gladiator-style death 
match.
With such a spectacle unfolding on cam-
pus, I propose we charge admission to the 
coliseum — i.e. Ben Hill Griffin Stadium — 
at the same price as a football game. With increased revenue thanks to our new regis-tration system and smaller class sizes thanks 
to the students unskilled in the art of war, 
what we’re left with is a win-win situation, which has a more appropriate economics term that I don’t know, because I’m an Eng-lish major, not a business major.
Should the idea of blood sport prove too 
much for the university, still in the spirit 
of quenching public thirst for elimination, I propose 
a series of dance-offs. (See 
FOX’s “So You Think You Can Dance,” or the ironi-cally titled “America’s Got Talent.”) What we have is 
the opportunity to impart a 
democratic forum — one in which the stu-
dents vote for who they feel earned his or her seat in a given class, not just the person 
who “registered first” for it.
But who will judge such a fierce competi-
tion? Why, a panel of experts, of course. To 
which you’re thinking, “Obviously, UF’s dance department!” To which I say, “Don’t be so silly.” When I say experts, I mean irrel-evant celebrities. Nick Canon is doing Tar -
get commercials. Nick Lachey is doing real-
ity television.  We all know Nick Jonas and 
Nicolas Cage aren’t doing anything, as well as that one Nick from the Backstreet Boys and that other Nick from that other thing. With this many talentless, able bodies, we 
have an ocean of disposable Nicks to choose 
from. And if UF is still hesitant about having its students fight to their grisly end, perhaps after the initial judging, we can have our 
panel of Nicks fight to the death. After all, 
it’s not like we would ever run out of them!
Which then brings me to my final plea: 
Do not do as I did and wait until the last minute to register for classes — at least to 
the extent that you’re driven mad by the 
perpetual refreshing of a page so you can take that one class you should have taken when you were a freshman. Don’t believe 
me? Please refer to the previous paragraphs 
and learn from my mistakes.

� NEW SINGLE, “WE ARE NEVER 
EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER,” IS NO. 1 ON BILLBOARD’S HOT 100.
ALYSSA HOLCOMB
Avenue Writer
It’s no secret that pop-country superstar 
Taylor Swift is famous for her themed song 
writing concerning breakups and general love-sickness. For her, it’s as if the theme is super-sized and mega-adaptable, fitting seamlessly 
into all types of beats and styles alongside the 
standard painful lyrical prose.
With the release of her latest single, the 
moody yet wordy “We Are Never Ever Get-ting Back Together,” which knocked Lady Ga-ga’s “Born This Way” out of the spot for larg-est digital song debut by a female artist with 623,000 downloads, Swift is again asserting her position as this decade’s resident heart-
ache heroine. Even though her fourth studio 
album “Red” won’t be released until Oct. 22, here’s a list of five of her most angry yet sad, happy yet regretful, ultimately girl-powered breakup anthems:
1. “Back To December” (from 2010’s “Speak Now”)
Who it’s about: Hunky “Twilight” were-
wolf Taylor Lautner is (well, reportedly) the inspiration for Swift’s “apology.”
What’s the style: A slow, twangy ballad 
with mournful vocal style, Swift laments her relationship woes in slow, pained lines.
How it’s visualized: Full of cold weather 
and snow-crunching metaphors of the heart, the music video features Swift wandering broodily throughout her darkened abode.
2. “Picture To Burn” (from 2008’s “Taylor 
Swift”)
Who it’s about: Lashing out at a sleazy ex-
boyfriend and all of his less-than-desirable traits, T. Swizzle sings the ultimate send-off.
What’s the style: This rollicking track fea-
tures Swift’s earlier, more country-twanged chops.
How it’s visualized: Complete with black 
leather and pyrotechnics, this breaking-and-entering how-to is straight out of the bitter ex-girlfriend’s guide to dream revenge tactics.
3. “White Horse” (from 2009’s “Fearless”)Who it’s about: With the picturesque 
“Prince Charming” character as her girlhood fantasy, Swift laments her loss of what she thought was her very own version.
What’s the style: Slow and drawling with 
simple guitar picks fit the sad yet relaxed mood of this single.
How it’s visualized: Rainy windowpanes 
and periodic flashbacks of cuteness (alongside MTV reality show “Laguna Beach” resident heartbreaker Stephen Colletti) invade Swift’s mind as she sits and reflects on what could have been.
4. “The Story of Us” (from 2010’s “Speak 
Now”)
Who it’s about: Singer/
songwriter (and well-pub-licized womanizer) John Mayer serves as the muse for both this track and the aptly titled “Dear John”.
What’s the style: Upbeat 
and peppy, the pessimistic theme is easily dis-guised as the ultimate girly-girl car jam.
How it’s visualized: Set in a library , Swift 
and her hipster glasses regale a past boyfriend with more charisma and zeal than many of her other videos.
5. “Should’ve Said No” (from 2008’s “Tay-
lor Swift”)Who it’s about: A cheating boyfriend is 
blasted in this adolescent ode to teenage ani-
mosity.
What’s the style: Similar to “Picture To 
Burn,” the heavier guitars and fiddle make 
for a more country-fied breakup anthem, with Swift’s lyrics more angry and vengeful than the rest.
How it’s visualized: In a live performance 
from the 2008 Academy of Country Music Awards, Swift powers through the song, at 
one point stamping out the lyrics under a wa-
terfall.
Even though many music listeners get an-
noyed with the consistent theme of Swift’s songs, it’s undeniable that girlfriend knows her stuff. Sure, she may repeatedly get her -
self into situations that call for heartbreak, but who are we to judge? She’s a successful sing-
er/songwriter with legions of fans all over the 
world who absolutely idolize her for becom-ing a voice to guide them through their own adolescent years of tear-filled romances. So if Swift wants to continue writing the same old no. 1 on the Billboard charts break-up anthem, then let her! Because we are never, ever, ever going to be able to stop listening anyway — like, ever.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
My mom keeps hounding me to go to the 
vagina doctor. I think my vagina is none of her business, and I will go if I feel like 
it. How do I get her off my back?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I have this guy “friend,” and we lie together and touch each other some -
times, but never have sex. I want to sleep with him, though. I’m afraid he just wants to be friends, and he is only following my lead regarding the tan -
talizing touch sessions. What do you 
think?Dear Friend,
What?! Go to the vagina doctor! Yea, OK, “wah wah wah, my mom cares about my health and the most awesome part of my body.” She probably thinks you’re boning and wants to get you on birth control (if you’re not already on it) or, ya know, legiti-mately cares about your body. Also, the lack of details in this question leads me to believe you still live under her roof, so you should 
really go.Dear Friend,
Even if this baby looks like it suffered from severe burns, you can’t tell her. If you can’t get yourself to lie, avoid the question. Ask your sister how happy she is with the new baby and how she is going to dress the baby for Halloween. Don’t ruin this for her, even if it looks like a fetus version of Voldemort. Maybe in a decade or two, when the baby grows out of his or her ugly-duckling stage, 
you can tell her the truth and joke about it.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My sister had a baby and, to be honest, it’s not that cute. Everyone else is telling her how cute her baby is, and I don’t 
know what to say. What do I do?
Dear Friend,
If you guys “touch” each other and he hasn’t brought up having sex yet, he’s probably a virgin or doesn’t have a penis. I don’t think a guy would go this far to follow your lead and secretly think “yea she’s gross and I’m getting no pleasure out of touching her.” He wants to bone. If you feel comfortable enough to take those vague “touches” to the next naked level, make a move. I am 99.99 
percent sure he won’t swat away your hand.THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 2012

Demps Hits Major Pay Day
According to NFL.com, Jeff Demps’ contract with the 
New England Patriots guarantees him $211,000, the second most of all undrafted free agents in 2012. Tight end Jordan Reed is back in practice after suffering an MCL sprain in the Gators’ ﬁ  rst scrimmage on Aug. 11. See story, page 19. 
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 When Brent Pease kicks his of-
fense into high gear, confusing op-
posing defenses with various for-mations, motions and shifts, Trey 
Burton and Omarius Hines are ex-pected to present some of the big-
gest problems. 
  The question defenses will have 
to answer isn’t simply, “Where will 
they line up?” It’s, “What are they?”
  “That’s where you have some 
issues from a defensive standpoint: 
How do you count this guy?” coach 
Will Muschamp said of Burton and Hines. “Is he a back? Is he a receiver? 
Is he a fullback? Is he a tight end? 
He’s going to line up in all the plac-
es, so it’s very difﬁ  cult for a defense 
to look at.” 
  The possibilities are exciting for 
Pease, who admits that in six years at Boise State, “we didn’t have play-
ers like that.” 
  Deciphering Pease’s offense was 
always going to be a chore for de-
fenses because of how difﬁ  cult it 
can be to identify how various shifts 
change the formation. 
  Knowing that the Gators have 
players in Burton and Hines who 
can be effective at multiple spots 
only adds to the challenge. 
  “They do create mismatches,” 
Pease said. “We will get them the ball, now they have to make plays.”
  That was much easier said than 
done last season. Burton caught 19 
passes for 149 yards and a touch-
down and carried the ball 37 times for 155 yards and three scores. Hines 
notched seven catches for 106 yards 
and had one carry for 12 yards, fail-
ing to ﬁ  nd the end zone all year. 
  Still, the optimism surrounding 
the 6-foot-3, 228-pound Burton and 
6-foot-2, 217-pound Hines is under-
standable.
  Along with 6-foot-3, 243-pound 
tight end Jordan Reed, Burton and Hines ﬁ  t into the category of players 
who are simultaneously too quick 
for linebackers to contain and too 
big for corners and safeties to cover. 
  “You’ve got a guy whose got 
speed and ability to run vertical and snap routes, you’re matched up on 
linebackers,” Pease said. “Some-body like Jordan, who’s got really 
wide receiver ability but in a body 
like his, he’s a nightmare for defen-
sive coordinators.” 
  The Gators are hoping Hines can 
join that cast of nightmares not just because of his versatility, but be-
cause of his big-play ability. 
  Hines averaged 14.8 yards per 
touch in his limited action last year, including a long of 39, and ripped off a 61-yard touchdown run in Fri-
day’s scrimmage. 
  “When the ball is in his hands, he 
can go the distance,” Pease said. “He 
can create the huge, explosive plays. 
He can go 75-80 yards, because he’s got the other gear. He’s got the abil-
ity to catch. He’s got the ability to 
run. He’s got strength.
  “He’s an incredible talent, so you 
just have to use him the right way.” 
  So far, it appears the Gators think 
every way is the right way to use Hines. 
  While his 61-yard touchdown 
came as a running back, Hines said he’s also lined up at wide receiver, 
tight end and fullback. 
  Although learning to play every 
position is a difﬁ  cult adjustment, 
Hines has been putting in extra time with coaches to make sure he’s up to 
speed at every position. 
  “At ﬁ  rst, it was a little over-
whelming,” Hines said. “It’s been 
a long journey, man. From playing

Pease excited by options
  The Gators have Georgia on their mind.
  After an offseason in which the players worked in 
the trenches of practice without making headlines off 
the ﬁ  eld, Florida has truly begun the Will Muschamp era.
  And now the Southeastern Conference Championship 
game in Atlanta supposedly awaits.
  “Guys have bought into what we are trying to do,” Mus-
champ said. “Obviously, their way didn’t work. They under-
stand where we are heading with this program.”
  The message this training camp has been SEC title game or 
bust, but reaching the Georgia Dome will be tough. 
  No. 23 Florida plays four teams ranked in the top 10 in the 
preseason poll.
  Of the last seven SEC title games, only one ﬁ  nalist has had 
fewer than 10 victories. Florida doesn’t have to be great. Try 
being good ﬁ  rst.
  Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst year didn’t go as 
planned.
He arrived at Florida with a de-
pleted roster and the sour stench left behind by Urban Meyer.
  Muschamp kicked Janoris Jenkins, 
his best cornerback, off the team in April due to a second marijuana-relat-ed arrest in the span of three months.
  Four other Gators were arrested during the 2011 offsea-
son.
  On the ﬁ  eld, players had to adjust to new coaches and new 
schemes. Those Gators were doomed from the start.
  UF couldn’t catch a break once football started. John Brant-
ley, the senior quarterback, and backups Jeff Driskel and Ja-coby Brissett were sacked nearly twice as often as they threw touchdowns, and the defense couldn’t stay off the ﬁ  eld.
  It took until the bowl game against Ohio State before the 
players bought into the new coaching staff.
  “I’m not surprised,” defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd said. 
“I’m not saying I expected it this way. Some people learn in 
different ways and some people group together in different 
ways, and it took us a year.”
  So let’s give these Gators a blank slate. The words from 
players and coaches during the preseason suggest these Gators have changed.
  UF is 15-11 the past two seasons, which ranked eighth in 
the SEC. They’re tired of mediocrity.
  Florida took the right steps this offseason.Muschamp had only two arrests and players ran their own 
practices. 
  Strength coach Jeff Dillman instituted a new training pro-
gram, which players and coaches have raved about.
  The mindset of this team has improved.  “Football means a lot more to some of the guys,” redshirt 
senior Sam Robey said. “A lot of entitlements are gone now.  Forget Atlanta: UF 
must move on from

  Hines agreed with a reporter’s assertion that he 
could be “Trey Burton 2.0,” saying he was “stronger and faster” than his versatile counterpart. 
  Pease has been careful not to overload Hines men-tally, and if UF’s jack of all trades can pick up the of-
fense as well as Pease says he has, it could be a long 
year for opposing defenses. 
  “He’s done a good job,” Pease said. “He is a very 
smart kid on the ﬁ  eld. He’s good. He understands things, and he wants more. He’s always, ‘Hey, can I 
do this play? Can I do that play?’ He’s a threat. He’s a weapon.”

That was one of our big prob-
lems last year.”
  Last season was not what 
this Muschamp-led program is about.
  “You get to the point where 
he’s put his stamp on the pro-
gram,” offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease said. “You’ve got a feel of the kids and you’ve built up your standards and how to interact. They know what’s right. They know what’s wrong. 
They know what is going to 
ﬂ  y in the system and what’s not going to ﬂ  y in the system. At times, you ﬁ  x things (that) 
aren’t working.”
  These Gators are on the mend 
and will show a better product 
on the ﬁ  eld.
  While reaching Atlanta may 
be the “goal,” just getting rid of 2011 would be an accomplish-ment by itself.

KNEE INJURY ON AUG. 11. 
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Two days after coach Will Mus-
champ announced Colin Thomp-
son would miss about eight weeks due to surgery on his right foot, the Gators have good news at 
tight end: Jordan Reed is healthy.
“He’s fine,” offensive coor-
dinator Brent Pease said. “He’s 
practicing.”
Reed sprained his MCL dur-
ing Florida’s scrimmage on Aug. 11. Muschamp initially predicted Reed would miss three to four days, but the junior ended up 
missing more than a week.
“Jordan Reed went through 
the walk-through this morning 
and looked good,” Muschamp said Monday. “Hopefully, (we will) get him back maybe in non-contact today.”
Despite missing two games 
last season, Reed was the Gators’ 
second-leading receiver with 28 
catches for 307 yards and two touchdowns. He is expected to be active for Florida’s opener against Bowling Green on Sept. 1.
Based on Pease’s confusion 
when asked how Reed’s health had progressed Wednesday, the New London, Conn., native’s 
well-being shouldn’t have even 
been in question.“You guys might be telling me 
something I don’t know,” Pease said. “Who? Who’s that? MCL? Who’s that?”
Trouble’s A-Foot: When Mus-
champ addressed the media on Aug. 15 regarding Jeff Driskel’s 
scapula contusion, there was a mi-
nor footnote. At the time, it went unnoticed.
“Mike McNeely, a walk-on 
who’s going to be a big part of our special teams, fractured his foot 
and he’ll be out six weeks,” Mus-
champ said last 
week.
McNeely, a 
5-foot-8 walk-on, 
had surgery on his foot on Mon-day. However, the sophomore 
wide receiver’s name popped up again on Wednesday when offen-
sive coordinator Brent Pease was 
assessing Florida’s wide receiv-ers.
“It really hurt when Mike Mc-
Neely (was injured) because he was having a good camp,” Pease said. “That kid was going to help us.”
McNeely dressed for every 
game last season except for Flori-da’s loss to Alabama on Oct. 1. He appeared in seven contests during the 2011 campaign, including the final five.
While McNeely’s performance 
in fall camp remains a mystery to those outside the team, Pease’s disappointment in losing a walk-
on to injury does not bode well for 
the Gators wide receivers group. Andre Debose led returning wide-outs with 16 catches last season.
As the season opener nears, 
Pease is confident the receivers will be ready to take a step for-ward in 2012.
“I think the guys are under-
standing their role,” Pease said. 
“Like I’ve told them, ‘If you 
want more, you better show con-sistency and create it.’ I think guys are kind of grasping onto that. I’m going to tell you this: We’re not just sticking anybody out there that looks pretty and can run. They better go out there and 
perform.”
No Scrimmage: Florida canceled 
its Tuesday scrimmage due to 
rain. With preparation for Bowl-ing Green set to begin this week-end, it will not be rescheduled.
“It gets too close to the game 
time and you risk injuries and 
stuff like that,” Pease said.
With the scrimmage out of the 
picture, Pease stressed the need 
for additional practice time.
“We’ve still got to get more 
reps,” he said. “Especially the reps that we lost out on [Tuesday] that we’ll probably get on practice situations here on Thursday and 
Friday before we really start put-
ting the game plan in.”
