Their fear has caged them 
into silence. They have done 
what they can to hide their identities. But oftentimes, it’s not enough to escape the threats and harassment. 
Animal researchers from 
public universities around Flor-ida are now ﬁ  ghting to keep their personal information out of the hands of animal rights activists.  
A bill moving through 
the House of Representatives would exempt the personal identiﬁ  cation information of animal researchers at public research facilities from being public record. 
UF, along with several state 
universities, is lobbying for the bill to protect researchers from potential danger and harass-ment. 
In Gainesville, an animal 
rights group has made UF’s in-volvement personal. 
The Eleventh Hour for Ani-
mals, which works to expose “the taxpayer-funded animal torture industry inside the Uni-versity of Florida,” has pub-lished personal identiﬁ  cation information on UF animal re-searchers on their website.  The group, known primarily for targeting UF primate research-ers, has publicized personal phone numbers, addresses and pictures of animal researchers at UF.
Disturbing pictures of pri-
mates being examined by re-searchers are featured on the organization’s website along with posters with quotes like “stop the holocaust inside UF, free the monkeys.” 
After a three year lawsuit, 
the organization, formerly named Negotiation is Over, obtained UF’s public veterinary records last April.
The researchers named in 
public records were the ﬁ  rst ones to be targeted by animal rights activists, said Janine Sikes, a UF spokeswoman.
“The university wants to be 
very open and honest about its research,” she said. “It wants to stop these personal attacks against our researchers.”
Sikes said the animal rights 
activists have made harass-ing phone calls, targeted fam-ily members and made death threats to UF animal research-ers. Due to this, the Eleventh Hour for Animals is under surveillance from the police de-partment and the FBI.
UF provided much of the 
language in the bill, which could take effect as soon as July.Universities seek to

Pink roseate spoonbills on the In-
dian River Lagoon capture a perfect 
Floridian scene on the 45th annual Spring Arts Festival’s poster.
“We all know the oak trees and 
the rolling hills, but let’s expose peo-ple to what else they can ﬁ  nd in Flor-ida,” said the Ocala artist Jacquelyn Schindehette.
Schindehette is among the many 
artists from across the country who showcase different mediums of art at the Santa Fe Arts Festival this weekend found in the blocks from Northeast Eighth Avenue to North-east Second Avenue.
Kathryn Lehman, coordinator of 
culture programs at Sante Fe Col-lege, said Schindehette’s painting captures the essence of the festival because it documents the beauty of Florida.
“The Santa Fe Springs Arts Festi-
val really represents the spirit of our community,” Lehman said, add-ing that she expects to match, if not surpass, the 100,000 visitors who at-tended the festival last year.
The free festival will consist of a 
range of activities ﬁ  t for all ages in-cluding crafts for children, live per-formances, music and food. Cami Cupples, a 19-year-old UF 
architecture sophomore, said she has never attended the festival but wants to go this year to see the art and speak with the people who cre-ated it.
“I have my perception of some-
thing, but when I talk to an artist, I get to see what’s going on in their brains,” Cupples said. “Art to me is the materialization of someone’s thoughts.”

Despite news reports about his  
attempts to scrub his online record, 
Jake Rush’s campaign maintains he did nothing wrong.
The local attorney and congres-
sional hopeful caught the spotlight this week after online comments insinuating sexual assault and drug use were traced back to a gaming account connected with Rush’s name.“Jake has never lied about these 
activities,” said Alex Patton, Rush’s campaign spokesman. “He didn’t make those comments.”
Gamer Lee Snyder took re-
sponsibility for the comments in a release from Rush’s campaign Wednesday.
Rush will face local Congress-
man Ted Yoho in the August Re-publican primary. Yoho campaign spokeswoman Kat Cammack told the Alligator Thursday that Yoho doesn’t engage in “any of this side-show distraction.”
In a statement released by Yoho’s 
campaign, the congressman dis-tanced himself from the situation. He called the rumors about the sex-ual and drug references “extremely disturbing,” and he said the content does not reﬂ  ect his values.
“This is an unfortunate dis-
traction, and I remain focused on reducing our $17.6 trillion dollar debt, creating jobs, and support for our veterans,” he said in the state-ment.
Rush denies wrongdoing, Yoho respondsNews Today

Gov. Rick Scott granted in-state tuition 
to veterans Monday in hopes of making 
Florida the most military-friendly state, and UF military members are saluting the efforts. 
The bill creates the Congressman C.W. 
Bill Young Veteran Tuition Waiver Pro-gram, named in memory of the military advocate. It aims to expand education and employment opportunities for veterans in Florida by waiving out-of-state tuition fees at state colleges and universities.
Honorably discharged veterans, Na-
tional Guard members and reserve compo-nents will reap the beneﬁ  ts of the slashed tuition rate, as well as job assistance pro-grams and funds for military and guard base improvements.
Previously, non-Florida resident veter-
ans were required to pay out-of-state tu-ition fees.
At UF, the in-state tuition rate for 2013-
2014 is $208.77 per credit hour. Out-of-state students pay $951.34 per credit hour.
Marcus Tucker, a 29-year-old former 
Marine Corps corporal and UF marketing senior, said he believes that it is unjust to charge veterans out-of-state tuition at pub-lic institutions.
“They don’t serve one state or anoth-
er state,” he said. “They serve the entire country.”
Tucker, who is the president of the UF 
Collegiate Veterans Society, said he com-mends the state of Florida for inviting vet-erans to come to Florida when they leave the military.
He said he believes that veterans are 
driven, focused on their training and rich with life experiences. By educating them at Florida universities, the state’s job mar-ket will gain a better workforce and a more productive economy.UF is home to about 680 student veter-
ans, Tucker said. He knows a handful of student veterans who pay out-of-state tu-ition, and the bill will help them.
The federal Post-9/11 GI Bill that many 
veterans use covers 100 percent of in-state tuition and fees. Waiving out-of-state fees allows veterans who qualify for both bene-ﬁ  ts to get an education essentially for free, Tucker said. 
It is common for UF Army ROTC cadets 
to serve as National Guard members while they’re in the ROTC program, said Kyle Everage, the UF Army ROTC recruiting operations ofﬁ  cer.  
 Students who participate in this Simul-
taneous Membership Program will be eli-gible for many of the beneﬁ  ts of the new bill.
“It deﬁ  nitely shows that their efforts 
are appreciated,” he said. “The ﬁ  nancial piece being taken care of it compensates them a little bit for all the time and effort they have to put in.” FRIDAY, APRIL 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

North Florida’s ﬁ  rst-ever En-
ergyWhiz Expo on Saturday will 
feature competitions to build the best miniature solar car and solar cooker.
County Commissioner Robert 
Hutchinson will attend the event: a forum for elementary, middle and high school students to dem-onstrate their science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills in hands-on, energy-focused com-petitions. 
Hutchinson will ofﬁ  cially declare 
April 5 as Solar Energy Education Day at the event, which will take place at Sante Fe College’s track.
The UF Solar Gators, a student 
club founded in Fall 2011 to build a solar-powered car, will host the event and have the frame of their own solar car on display.
“The purpose of the event is to 
basically get alternative energy ideas out there and support sus-tainable energy,” said Aja Garri-son, 20-year-old UF public relations senior and UF Solar Gators’ public relations chair.
During the regional Junior Solar Sprint competition, teams of upper elementary and middle school stu-dents will race to build the best min-iature solar car, powered entirely by solar energy and steered by wires.
In the Solar Energy Cook Off, 
students in fourth through 12th grade will work in teams to design and build solar cookers and demon-strate their efﬁ  ciency by creating an original dish of food for the compe-tition, she said. 
The competitions foster educa-
tion about sustainability among youth, said Jason Rosen, 21-year-old UF material science and engi-neering senior and UF Solar Gators president.  
“We are excited to be involved 
with the educational aspect of the event and get the community in-volved,” Rosen said.
Grade-school students compete in solar engineering competition“They don’t serve one state or 
another state. They serve the entire 
country.”

corporal and UF marketing seniorIf approved, the bill would 
exempt the personal identiﬁ  -
cation of researchers in animal records on treatment and care, research protocols and approv-als, purchase or billing records, animal care and use committee records, and facility and lab re-cords.  
In 2011, a member of Elev-
enth Hour for Animals posted ﬂ  iers offering money for infor-mation on researchers experi-menting with animals. Howev-er, Camille A. Marino, Eleventh Hour for Animals founder and executive director, said that the group has never threatened or committed violent acts against the researchers at UF.
“The only violence that is 
happening is the violence they commit against animals for money,” she said. “My intent is never to threaten anyone, only to provide information that the community has a right to know.”
On behalf of the Eleventh 
Hour for Animals, Marino has ﬁ  led a federal complaint with the U.S. Department of Agricul-ture requesting an investigation into “apparent egregious and repeated violations of the Ani-mal Welfare Act related to non-human primates being ware-housed inside the University of Florida.” The letter details the organization’s concern for UF’s treatment of Booger, a macaque monkey.Marino said the monkey is 
showing signs of mental dete-rioration because of his conﬁ  ne-ment.
“I want him out of there,” 
Marino said. “I want all of the monkeys out of there. I fully in-tend to do whatever it takes to have that program shut down and disbanded.”
UF is not alone in its ﬁ  ght for 
privacy. Universities lobbying for the bill include the Univer-sity of Central Florida, Florida International University and the University of South Florida.
Grant Heston, associate vice 
president for communications and public affairs at UCF, said animal researchers are being targeted at universities across the U.S.
“We feel it’s a responsible 
measure to help protect those individuals,” Heston said.
Due to colleagues receiving 
threats, a UF researcher has chosen to remain anonymous to discuss possible future pri-mate research.
“I’m extremely concerned 
about being able to do pri-mate research on this campus,” the researcher said. “I don’t want my name and my house bombed. I don’t want them to stand in front of my house.”  
The researcher’s fear is con-
cern enough to consider not performing research on the pri-mates. The researcher wants to give back to humans with their research but may reconsider for fear of harassment, adding, “I will face a horriﬁ  c time if my name is not covered.”

WASHINGTON — The White 
House says a “Cuban Twitter” 
communications network created by the U.S. government was a “development” program and not a covert operation.
Spokesman Jay Carney says he 
is not aware of individuals in the White House who were aware of the program, but he also says President Barack Obama does support efforts to expand com-munications in Cuba.
The Associated Press has 
learned that the communications network was built with secret shell companies and ﬁ  nanced through foreign banks.
Carney says the government 
does take steps to be discreet when working in “non-permis-sive environments” including Cuba. He says those steps are taken to protect “practitioners and the public.”
Some view the project as a welcome alternative to the de-cades-old Cold War between the United States and Cuba that has involved more violent efforts to overthrow the Castro govern-ment, including a failed plot to give then-President Fidel Castro an exploding cigar. For others, the news sparked fear that the program would only help the Cuban government’s efforts to discredit the island’s small move-ment of independent journalists and bloggers.

The success of the Gators men’s 
basketball team may also lead to 
increased success for local busi-nesses. 
Jeff Hickey, managing partner 
of Tall Paul’s, said the Gators’ March Madness bid has enthused downtown and boosted overall dynamics.
“Anytime the Gators are do-
ing well, it brings an energy to the town and people go out more,” Hickey said. “They get more ex-cited to go out, stay out and spend some money.”
Nicholas Smith, general man-
ager of The Swamp Restaurant, said he has noticed a similar influx of business at the sports bar as the Gators advanced through the sea-son.
“Especially when games are far 
away ... people have to go watch it,” he said. “People want to enjoy sports with their friends.”
Smith said since the basket-
ball season started, he has seen a transformation in the restaurant’s dynamics.
“It’s just a change in atmo-sphere,” he said. “It gets them ex-cited, gets them coming out. It gets them to us.” 
Retail stores are benefiting, too.Christina Rodenwoldt, manag-
er at Gator Plus, 1620 W. Univer-sity Ave., said March brought an increase in sales of Gators-themed gear.
“We are seeing a lot of inter-
est,” Rodenwoldt said. “Especially if there is a home game or right after we have won. The fact that we got into the Final Four, there is definitely an upswing of people calling Internet orders, coming into the store.”
Andrew Poe, general manager 
of Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar, said although the venue is not a sports bar, it always does well in spring because of fans who want to enjoy downtown Gainesville. 
“As far as Gator basketball, 
we are peaking right now as far as NCAA Tournament and SEC Tournament, and it is spring,” Poe said. “Downtown Gainesville is peaking at the exactly the same time. So, it’s like with Gator athlet-ics doing so well and this naturally being a good time for businesses in downtown Gainesville. It’s a good formula.”
The Gators’ win against Dayton 
last Saturday unleashed crowds of people wanting to celebrate down-town afterward, Poe said.
“It was such a big deal — we 
were going to the Final Four,” Poe said. “Everyone got into their cars and headed from wherever they were watching the game to down-town to celebrate it, and we saw a tremendous positive effect from that.”

A report published on AlterNet this week found that NFL 
cheerleaders have fewer labor rights than exotic dancers. The depressing article makes us wonder why anyone would choose a career in professional cheerleading: Their handbooks are borderline draconian, all their rehearsal hours are unpaid, and their total seasonal revenue amounts to less than $5 per hour — in fact, the NFL mascots have higher salaries than NFL cheerleaders. The U.S. Labor Department labels cheerleaders “seasonal amusement.” 
Um, what the actual f**k? By that logic, aren’t all athletes 
“seasonal amusement”? Most NFL cheerleaders, AlterNet stated, are trained dancers holding down college degrees and second jobs in order to be cheerleaders. A we-call-bulls**t-on-the-”cheerleading-isn’t-a-sport”-argument DART to the NFL 
for exploiting one of its biggest revenue drivers — women who kick ass and look great in thigh-high boots while doing so.

The leaked logo has inspired vitriol among FSU stu-dents and alumni, who went so far as to start online petitions to keep the old logo. Why all the hate? We think the logo per-fectly encapsulates the one university in the country where a student can get college credit for being a clown.

In Gainesville, we love our craft beer. In fact, craft breweries 
are having a moment right now — so much so that larger beer distributors are taking notice, and they’re not happy about it.
Craft brewers in Florida are currently facing a battle in 
the legislature, as a bill pending in the Florida Senate would stipulate that craft brewers sell their bottles and canned beer directly to a distributor, according to Reuters. 
While other states nurture craft breweries, brewers in 
Florida say the environment for independent beer operations is hostile and dominated by politically inﬂ  uential national distributors seeking to suppress small breweries. This week, we’re tossing a Big-Nose-IPA-before-Natty-Light DART to 
champions of the anti-craft-brew bill. 
The biggest pat on the back of the year goes to our men’s 
basketball team and Billy Donovan. Seriously, we’re beyond excited for Saturday. Enjoy your time in the limelight, boys, and keep doing us proud. 
For all their hard work, we’re giving a dem-muscles-doe

Go Gators!Embrace the dad jeans: Normcore is in
Spring is abloom, but ignore the ﬂ  ower prints and 
bright colors: What you should really be digging out of your closet is the pair of dad jeans you bought 
months ago at the thrift with the intention of turning into distressed cutoffs. 
So what if you never got around to doing the dirty 
work? By now you’ve missed the peak of the underbutt trend. 
The good news is those dad jeans have normcore writ-
ten all over them. 
Normcore is the trendy new way to state you don’t 
care about fashion by wearing things “normal” people would wear. Because just when you thought the word trendy couldn’t be any more cringe worthy, it became trendy to be anti-trend. 
For those of you who still don’t follow, picture a style 
in which homeless-biker meets off-duty-model, a la bag-gy white crew-neck T-shirt, your favorite Gators wind-breaker and Jerry-Seinfeld dad jeans paired with boxy running shoes.
Does this sound like your go-to outﬁ  t for the past six 
years? Congratulations on being normcore before norm-core was a thing.  
It’s hard to say when the anti-fashion fashion state-
ment became a trend, but I ﬁ  rst read about normcore in a New York Magazine article in February that explored the term not only as a way of dress but as a theory that people were moving away from fashion as a statement and viewing way of dress as a form of interconnectivity. 
Since then, it seems “stylized blandness,” as New York 
Magazine writer Fiona Duncan put it, has been creeping up all over the place. Vanity Fair, GQ, Reﬁ  nery29, Jezebel and even The New York Times have written about the trend. And hashtag-ability aside, I’m convinced it’s only a thing because people keep talking about it.
The idea behind normcore is that you wouldn’t be able 
to differentiate a person who actually cares about fashion from a person who wears New Balance sneakers and dad jeans because he’s from a time-warped suburban town in Idaho where dressing styl-ishly is much less of a desired skill than say, drawing magical beasts or hacking computers.
And I get that. No one said 
dressing well had to be at the top of everyone’s to-do list, but when did everyone get so caught up in being indistinguishable?
As far as 2014 goes, everyone 
is interested in self-branding. 
Even normcore icons like Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes and comedian Jerry Seinfeld have clearly distinguishable images on social media, and it seems they wouldn’t be much different in person.
Some fashion writers have said normcore’s purpose 
is to blend the wearer into the general public so that the wearer can be an Everyman, connecting with the popula-tion and eschewing popular fashion. 
And that’s cool. I can see how wanting to connect with 
others is an incentive to dress differently. 
But the idea of dressing a certain way to cultivate a 
certain feeling is something that’s done regularly. It’s why places have dress codes and period pieces have time-sensitive costumes.
If you’re having a hard time wrapping your head 
around this whole normcore thing, don’t worry — I am, too. 
Where I’m most lost is in the idea of the terminology.Who chose normcore, and why did they choose it?Dressing like you’re stuck in the ‘90s doesn’t make you 
more normal than someone who’s embracing trends that have been inspired by various decades or vice versa.
The whole idea of normcore as a trend is just silly. Normcore — the anti-fashion fashion statement — be-
cause nothing screams normal like, “Hey, I’m dressing this way to be normal.”

Sitting behind his anchor 
desk on Monday night,  Stephen Colbert offered 
the nation a ﬁ  rm and righ-teous apology. 
He was diffusing a situa-
tion that began last week with a tweet. In case you haven’t heard or read the news for the past six months, there have been repeated and increasing-ly vehement calls for Wash-ington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change his team’s name to something that isn’t a word that would be tossed around on the Trail of Tears. 
In what was either an in-
credibly clumsy or totally un-self-aware move, Dan Sny-der started the Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation. Colbert, while in character as the clueless pun-dit, satirized the foundation with his own Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.  
What was clearly a mock-
ery of Snyder’s publicity stunt was taken to Twitter. Some-one from the Twitter account run by Comedy Central, not Colbert himself, tweeted “I am willing to show #Asian com-munity I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.” But 140 characters doesn’t leave much room for context, and soon Twitter’s outrage ma-chine was hungry for Colbert blood. 
The tweet was seen by 
prominent Asian-American hashtag activist Suey Park, who has started hashtags be-fore to cultivate discussion on the social network such as #NotYourAsianSidekick. This time, though, the hashtag campaign was aimed squarely at cancelling the Colbert Re-port, presumed because the hashtag was #CancelColbert. 
#CancelColbert gained 
a lot of publicity, but it also generated a lot of outrage in the opposite direction, with many fans of the show up in arms over the threat to their beloved Report. 
The ensuing outrage 
ﬁ  restorm caught the attention of the broader news media, generating scores of articles debating things like white privilege and the nature of satire. Two Korean-American writers from Deadspin wrote the eloquently titled “Gooks Don’t Get Redskins Joke.” The issue was, to say the least, very hairy.
The problem with this 
whole ﬁ  asco is that it was the answer to Snyder’s prayers. Any discussion of his team and his foundation, the origi-nal inspiration for the offend-ing tweet, was left out of the conversation. 
During the height of the 
madness, a New Yorker piece gave #CancelColbert’s master-mind an opportunity to elabo-rate on it beyond the conﬁ  nes of Twitter. Park explained that she was ﬁ  ghting satire with satire, saying her ultimate goal was to point out the hy-pocrisy of white liberals who accept more nuanced forms of racism from people they share some political beliefs with. 
Maybe she’s sincere, or 
maybe she’s retroactively changing the conversation. In the wake of Colbert’s apology, the whole thing has lost its volatility. The problem with Snyder and his Redskins isn’t going anywhere, but neither is the movement to change the name.  
The whole deal can serve 
as a kind of teaching moment. 
Assuming racial humor 
is acceptable because worse forms of racism exist is a mis-conception, something that gets overlooked by people all too often. Look no further than the “Happy Fortune Buf-fet” ﬂ  iers that were posted around campus just before Spring Break. Well-meaning satire, which can be used to ﬁ  ght against injustice and hy-pocrisy, can backﬁ  re horribly. Even people who write and present jokes for a living can make mistakes, so aspiring and amateur jokesters should keep in mind the unintended effects of what they might say.

opinions@alligator.orgThe rapid growth of technology’s ca-
pabilities is cause to reﬂ  ect on what privacy means in the 21st century. But 
the U.S. government is not concerned with such reﬂ  ection. In the post-9/11 world, the government has made it a top priority not  to redeﬁ  ne but destroy the idea of privacy.
By June 7, it was clear that idea of privacy had been 
under attack for years. A day earlier, former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald published internal NSA documents leaked to him by whistleblower Edward Snowden, revealing the U.S. government has had direct access to the data of major American companies. Within 24 hours, President Barack Obama assured the public that the covert programs used to spy on American citi-zens and peoples abroad were both legal and necessary. By December, a federal judge in California had ruled the NSA spying unconstitutional.
To be clear, the kind of NSA spying differs from the 
typical Cold War-era espionage that comes to mind. Rather than identifying targets, tapping their phones and intercepting their mail upon suspicion of crimes, the NSA collects all of the electronic communications of every individual communicating within, from and to the U.S. Such actions actively negate laws dating back to 1215 with the signing of the Magna Carta — the presumption of inno-cence. In the eyes of the U.S. government, everyone is born guilty. 
We must assume that everything we do 
on a cell phone or computer will always exist on an NSA server and can be used against us.
Given the nature of the evidence supplied by 
Snowden, it’s easy to persuade a reasonable person that the government is invading his or her privacy. How-ever, a much more difﬁ  cult task is convincing people to care or ﬁ  ght to stop such injustices from occurring.  How does one overcome the oppression of the most powerful force in human history, namely, the United States?
There is no magic formula. Sadly, far too many peo-
ple are unaware of the government’s efforts to destroy the private sphere. We must talk about these issues.
Don’t let friends and family tell you that your boring 
political rants are bumming them out or that they would like to talk about it if only they more informed. Inform them! Bum them out! The time for comfort and apathy is over.

Government seeks to destroy privacyGuest column
On Monday I was surprised to learn that Accent Speak-er’s Bureau had to cancel 
its event featuring former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after he backed out of the interview. I as-sumed it was an early April Fools’ Day joke. The news of the cancella-tion came the same day that Olmert was convicted of bribery in a Tel Aviv court for taking $160,000 in bribes to speed along government permits to build the Holyland hous-ing estate while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.
But that isn’t the only reason why 
students should be wary of hosting Olmert on campus. Olmert was the prime minister of Israel during Op-eration Cast lead, which left more than 1,400 Palestinians dead in Gaza and, according to the Goldstone Re-port, is responsible for potential war crimes. 
Some Olmert supporters might note his realignment plan that calls for Israeli settlements in 90 percent of the West Bank to be dismantled and evacuated as reason for his being a champion of peace. However, Olmert’s plan won’t meet the minimal requirements of inter-national law or UN resolutions de-manding Israel withdraw to its pre-1967 border, the Green Line.
Instead, under his plan the bulk 
of Israel’s settlements will be con-solidated: The Palestinians will not be offered a viable state, and their lives will continue to be dependent on the Israeli army’s goodwill. In other words, the occupation will metamorphose but it will still be an occupation.
It is not appropriate for Accent to 
bring such an individual and justify it by having Rula Jebreal, a Pales-tinian correspondent for MSNBC, interview the former prime minis-ter. This practice by Accent is very tokenizing. One Palestinian doesn’t speak for all Palestinians. 
It is not only offensive to Pales-
tinians to bring such a speaker but also to those who stand against war criminals and believe in the integrity of international law.
If Accent wants to bring speakers 
concerning this topic, I would sug-gest they look into names such as Ali Abunimah, Miko Peled, Ilan Pappe or Noam Chomsky. 
In the future, we would hope that 
Accent and others recognize this less as a conﬂ  ict and more as a struggle of an oppressed, occupied people against settler colonialism, segrega-tion and a state that wants to erase its history and narrative.

A Georgia man is looking to sell a 13-
foot mounted bull alligator that’s been 
living under a blanket in his garage.
Don Perkins, 65, of Darien, Ga., got 
the American alligator after Florida wildlife ofﬁ  cials ordered Perkins’ cous-in — a licensed alligator trapper — to kill the animal in Palmdale, Fla. He had the alligator mounted about three years ago and is now hoping he can earn back the money that he invested in the proj-ect, which adds up to about $7,000.
Perkins said the alligator was laid 
out in the back of his cousin’s Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck when he ﬁ  rst saw it. Its head was hanging out of the back of the truck with its snout kissing the pavement.
“I knew there was something I could 
do with it other than have him turned into purses and pocketbooks,” Perkins said.
So he took the animal home and 
made it his project. He called taxider-mist after taxidermist. Most laughed at the request to mount such a large animal in a standing position. He then found Johnny Walker in Deland who turned his vision into a reality for about $4,500.
Michael Moulton, a professor of 
wildlife ecology and conservation at UF, said that although opinions may differ on the subject, the animal’s death was legal because he was considered a nui-sance and killed by a licensed trapper. 
Perkins named the animal George af-
ter a gator that almost killed him when he was a child. There was nothing more than 3 feet and a ﬁ  shing pole between 11-year-old Perkins and the gator when the animal opened its jaw and smacked its tail on the water.
The new George now stands 7 feet 
tall on a green carpeted stand wearing a XXXL Tim Tebow jersey and holding a football signed by UF’s three Heisman winners — Tebow, Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel. There are wheels on the bottom.
“You can push him like a shopping 
cart in a grocery store,” he said.
Lately, George hasn’t been in the 
spotlight. He calls Perkins’ garage home. His only company is two motor-cycles and a lawn mower. Still, Perkins keeps a blanket over him, keeping dust from building up in the cracks between his scales.
Perkins is hoping he can sell George 
and is asking for $6,500. He said he would like someone to buy George, auction him off and give the proceeds to charity.
“I’m not trying to make a single dime 
off of George,” he said.

�E-CIGS COULD BE BANNED ON CAMPUS.
BROOKE AUSTILL

Gainesville city commissioners unanimously 
voted in favor of regulating the use of e-cigarettes 
in a commission meeting Thursday.
The proposed ordinance would prohibit the 
sale of e-cigarettes to minors. It would ban selling them through vending machines, and it would ban their use in tobacco-free areas like UF’s campus.
Kathy Nichols, assistant director for UF Area 
Health Education Centers Program, spoke  during the meeting about the use and preliminary dan-gers of e-cigarettes.
Nichols said e-cigarettes contain nicotine, poly-
ethylene glycol — which creates the smoke effect — and other questionable ﬂ  avored chemicals.
She said although some dangers have been 
found involving e-cigarette use, more information is still needed to determine long-term effects of the product. 
She said some research shows the product is 
popular among teens.
“There are youth who are starting to use the 
product who have never used traditional ciga-rettes,” Nichols said.
Mayor Ed Braddy said during the meeting that 
the e-cigarette could be a starting point for chil-dren to use traditional tobacco.
“I would think just intuitively, especially for 
kids, that it’s probably more like a gateway to ciga-rettes,” he said.
Allison Justice, a UF mass communications 
graduate student, participated in preliminary re-search that suggests e-cigarette advertising mes-sages target adolescents. Justice, 24, said that while some of the messages could persuade cigarette smokers to transition to the e-cigarette, the ads could also spike a curiosity in children.
“Our youth generation is the e-generation,” 
Justice said. “Anything electronic, they want their hands on.”
Although all commissioners were in favor of 
the motion, the ordinance must go to a second hearing until it can be adopted ofﬁ  cially.   Commission

Gainesville Police arrested a vol-
unteer at a local church Wednesday 
on accusations of sexually assaulting a 2-year-old girl on the playground. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 64-year-old Floyd 
Delmer Wilson on charges of sexual battery, according to an arrest report.
Between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. Mon-
day, staff members babysat the toddler at Parkview Baptist Church, located at 3403 NW 13th St. 
While bathing her daughter that 
evening, the mother noticed she was hurt. The girl said someone touched her genitals and reenacted the touch-ing on a doll, according to the report. 
During questioning, Wilson even-
tually admitted to penetrating her with two ﬁ  ngers but said it was by accident when he tried to pick her up. While of-ﬁ  cers questioned him, he often smiled and also reenacted the hand motions, according to the report.  
Wilson did not give a deﬁ  nitive 
yes or no answer about whether he touched other children at the church. He said phrases like “not to my knowl-edge,” “I do not believe so,” and “I can’t remember.”
A witness told ofﬁ  cers on the day 
of the incident he did not see any in-appropriate touching, but when he walked out to the playground where Wilson was with the toddler, she was “hysterically crying.”
Parkview Baptist Church released 
a statement saying it “will have no further comment until we learn more from the criminal investigation.”

At the Thursday night City Commission 
runoff candidate forum, a debate about city is-
sues was partially clouded by sharp comments from each candidate about her opponent.
Helen Warren and Annie Orlando, the 
commission candidates, will compete for the at-large seat in the election Tuesday. The top-ics included urban development, transporta-tion and Gainesville Regional Utilities issues.  
When discussing the city’s budget, Warren 
said Gainesville is facing challenges the city has never dealt with before.  
“We do have a crisis,” she said. “There’s 
not a single department out there that can say, ‘We haven’t already been facing budget cuts.’” Referencing Warren’s comment about the 
budget, Orlando said she was “glad that Hel-en ﬁ  nally wants to have a conversation (on budget issues).”
Orlando cited reﬁ  nancing debt as a way for 
the city to control the budget and focused her attention on the appointment of a new GRU general manager.
“GRU is going to need to have someone 
who is forward-thinking so we can evolve and be a viable company,” she said.
In the closing remarks, Warren focused 
on why Orlando should have run for County Commission instead of City Commission.
“(Orlando) shows that if things don’t go 
her way, she sues the city,” Warren said. “So Annie, I think you would have been a great candidate to have gone for county.”
Orlando quickly questioned how many 
city committees Warren had served on. She closed by citing her involvement and reﬂ  ect-ing on her support.
“We need not just the nicest person but the 
one who is the most prepared and most quali-ﬁ  ed for the job,” she said.Runoff candidates criticize

Shane McCann is so hot right now.
He’s leading Wing Zone’s Flavor 
Face-Off competition, in which peo-
ple from across the country go head-to-head to ﬁ  nd the next sauce ﬂ  avor in a Sweet Sixteen-style bracket.
McCann, a 23-year-old UF an-
thropology senior, has more than 1,000 votes for his jalapeno cheddar ﬂ  avor. 
His opponent’s Baked-Potato 
Blast ﬂ  avor has about 450 votes.The winner, who will be an-
nounced Monday, will receive a 46-inch ﬂ  at-screen TV, a tailgating party for 20 friends and a $100 Fa-natics.com gift card, among other rewards. 
McCann said he found out about 
the contest through a ﬂ  ier he re-ceived with his Wing Zone delivery. He joined it to get the 10 free wings that were awarded to each contes-tant for entering.
The ﬂ  avor idea was inspired by 
a pepper- and cheese-loaded burger he ate the night before.
“I thought it would taste deli-
cious on a wing,” he said.
Dan Corrigan, Wing Zone’s mar-
keting manager, said this is the sec-ond time Wing Zone has held the contest. Participation has increased by about 500 submissions and a couple thousand votes so far.

The seconds ticked by for 
contestants striving to cram 
their massive amounts of re-search, sometimes amounting to 80,000 words, into three minutes.
UF doctoral students of all 
disciplines competed Thurs-day in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom to win $500 and the chance to continue to the re-gional competition. This was the ﬁ  rst Three Minute Thesis competition at UF, where 11 contestants compressed their graduate theses into three-minute presentations without outside props except for one PowerPoint slide.
The winner, Michael Shultz, 
is a UF graduate student doing research on pediatric osteosar-coma, bone cancer in children.
Nina Zagvazdina, a third-
year UF entomology graduate student, went to the event to ﬁ  nd out a presentation style she could use for her research.
“It was a great low-com-
mitment way to ﬁ  nd out what people are doing,” she said. “I wanted to get an exposure to different speech style.”
Ruth Perez, a clerk in the UF 
graduate school who helped organize the competition, said the goal was to expose the au-dience to a higher level of re-search.
“Our goal is to demystify 
what our graduate students are doing,” she said. “Some-times what they are doing can be very complicated  — and most of us are not going to get a Ph.D. ourselves  — so we can’t speak to them at that same level.”Graduate students

UF track team to compete at home
The UF track and field team begins competition today at the annual Florida 
Relays, which began yesterday with the high school portion of competition. Events begin at 10 a.m. at the Percy Beard Track.Murphy waived from Bulls
The Chicago Bulls waived former UF forward Erik Murphy on Thursday. In 24 appearances this season, Murphy averaged just 0.3 points per game.The UF men’s tennis team plays Mississippi State this weekend. Read the story online at alligatorSports.orgERICA A. HERNANDEZ

The Gators will be more rested 
than usual when they compete at 
the 2014 NCAA University Park Regional on Saturday. 
Besides competing against four 
teams that No. 1 Florida (15-2, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) did not face in the regular season, timing will also be different. 
“The regional champ is really 
kind of a different feeling,” coach Rhonda Faehn said.  “Because there’s a greater variety of schools that we haven’t seen all year long.” 
With six teams in the field and 
only four events occurring at any given time, two teams will be sit-ting out on a bye in the rotation. In-stead of competing all four events back to back, the Gators will begin on vault and then take their first bye for the second rotation. 
They will then come back to 
compete on uneven bars and bal-ance beam in the third and fourth rotations, take a final bye in the fifth rotation and then come back to end on floor in the sixth.
The order of the events will be 
no different than a regular home meet. The only difference will be the approximately 20 minutes in

Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week on Wednesday after helping No. 7 Florida sweep  Arkan-sas and LSU last weekend at home. 
The rookie is having an re-
velatory first year as a Gator, tallying 29 doubles victories to lead the team.
Florida (15-4, 7-2 SEC) 
expects Keegan’s consistent play to continue when it trav-els to face Mississippi State (9-10, 1-8 SEC) at 6 p.m.
The freshman’s elevated 
play has allowed Coach Ro-land Thornqvist to start her and senior Olivia Janowicz on Court 1 in doubles. The move has been very success-ful — the duo is 10-2 as a team this season.
“They have a tremen-
dous amount of confidence,” Thornqvist said of the tan-dem. 
“At [Court] 1, against the 
really good teams, you can’t hit and look. You got to be able to hit and go. And I think they are [there] now.”
On a team where the 
lineup rotates from week-to-week, Keegan has held down the lower courts for the bulk of the season.  
The freshman is usually 
the first Gator to earn a point and has won four of her last five singles matches. Against the Razorbacks on Friday, it took Keegan just 49 minutes to win her singles match.
“She’s an incredible tal-
ent, and she’s just got all the tools,” Thornqvist said. Keegan leading

Buddy Reed stepped to the plate with run-
ners on first and second in the ninth inning 
against Florida Atlantic. Florida needed one run for the walk-off win. It never came. The Gators’ leadoff batter reached base in the ninth and 10th frames only to leave the go-ahead run on the bases. 
Reed bunted too hard and too close to FAU 
pitcher Kevin Alexander, who easily threw out John Sternagel on the force out to third base. Two straight fielder’s choices by Casey Turgeon and Richie Martin ended the rally. Harrison Bader singled to start the 10th inning before getting picked off at first base.
Tuesday night marked the first loss for UF 
in five games. It was also the first time since its run of 13 wins in 16 games that execution wasn’t there, as Coach Kevin O’Sullivan said the Gators weren’t ready to play. After three first-inning runs, the midweek matchup dragged on and on.
Facing ranked squads like Florida State 
and LSU has forced Florida to play perfectly on the mound and at the plate. The same level of perfection wasn’t there 
when UF played FAU. 
“It was up and down. 
The hits weren’t falling for us. I’m not sure,” freshman left-hander A.J. Puk said. “It did seem kind of low.”
That’ll need to change 
today when No. 13 Florida 
(19-10, 6-3 Southeastern Conference) visits No. 22 Kentucky (20-9, 4-5 SEC) for a critical SEC series. Florida is tied for first with No. 2 South Carolina in the Eastern Division and will be-gin an eight game road trip at UK, USC, FSU and FGCU.
Against the Owls on Tuesday, O’Sullivan 
brought the team together in the third in-ning for a meeting. After scoring three quick first-inning runs, the Gators’ bats went silent. Florida finished 2 for 9 with runners in scoring position and left eight runners on base.
“The bottom line is we score three in the 
first. We score one run over the next 10,” O’Sullivan said. “We threw away a lot of at-bats.”

really kind of a different

Sternagel provides consisten-
cy: Third base always seems to be 
a never-ending game of musical 
chairs for the Gators, but it hasn’t always been a detriment to the team.
From 2010-2012, a UF fresh-
man third baseman—Austin Maddox, Zack Powers and Josh Tobias—made the SEC’s All-Freshman team.
But neither Powers nor Tobias 
won the job last season, as they platooned and combined to start 29 and 30 games, respectively.
But now, the Gators look well 
on their way to adding a fourth player in five years to that list with John Sternagel. He arrived at UF after a standout career at Rockledge High School where he earned Perfect Game All-Amer-ican honors with future team-mates Brett Morales and Puk.
Sternagel has hit .313 with six 
RBIs in five-straight starts at third and has split time with Tobias and fellow freshman Pete Alonso at the position. O’Sullivan said on Tuesday night that Sternagel gives the Gators a run producer in the latter part of the lineup. He’s batted seventh or eighth in each of his nine starts.
“He’s stepping up right now. 
He’s definitely coming through when we need him,” second baseman Casey Turgeon said. “It’s good to see a young player doing that.”
Puk continues pitching prow-
ess: Puk had one pitch Tuesday night he’d like to forget. In the fifth inning, he tossed an 0-2 fast-ball to C.J. Chatham, who some-how got around on the high offer-ing at his chin for a leadoff home run out of McKethan Stadium.
The left-hander finished with 
six strikeouts in three-innings that summed up his first season on the mound. He’s been a domi-nant power pitcher at times and a talented left-hander with com-mand issues during others.
“This year obviously I’ve been 
better coming out of the pen and I’ve struggled in my starts,” he said. “I’d like to become a starter sometime next year just to get the opportunity, but I just need to work on getting better command and throwing all my pitches for strikes.”
“She’s got a great serve, she’s 
got presence, she’s willing to move and poach, and she’s got great power from the ground. 
“She has all the little things 
that it takes.”
Keegan is diligently working 
to improve each aspect of her game as the post-season draws closer.
“My serve, I’ve been working 
on it for the past couple weeks and it showed,” she said. “I was working on patterns, with my forehand going across court and opening the court and going down the line. So that’s helped me a lot.”
Florida hopes Keegan and its 
other freshmen will continue to help propel it to the top of the SEC standings.
 The Gators currently sit in 
fourth place, only two matches behind first place No. 8 Vander-bilt. 
If Florida wins today and 
against Ole Miss on Sunday, a home victory over the Commo-dores next week could decide the SEC race, and the Gators are 190-1 against SEC opponents at home.
“Playing on the road obvi-
ously is the trickier part. Look at what we’ve been able to do [at home],” Thornqvist said. 
“It’s tough to win on the road 
in the SEC in any sport.”FRIDAY, APRIL 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

the second and fifth rotations when the Gators will 
be waiting in their locker room to get back on the floor for the next event. 
“Personally, I think byes are great,” Bridget 
Sloan said. “It’s a time to kind of relax because…your adrenaline cannot be at a high for that long.” 
Sloan experienced byes with the 2013 team at 
the last NCAA Regionals and in the 2013 Super Six meet. Florida claimed a No. 1 finish in both events. 
“It was definitely different but it was awesome 
because everyone came together as a team for once and we all helped each other kind of calm down a little bit in the locker room,” Sloan said. “It was honestly like we had five minutes of chill time, and then we had about 10 minutes to get pumped again. You were able to come down but then get right back up.” 
The top-two finishers from each of the six re-
gional sites will move on to the NCAA Champi-onships, which take place April 18-20 in Birming-ham, Ala. 
Florida will compete against No. 12 Oregon State, No. 15 Penn State, No. 23 New Hampshire, No. 29 Kentucky and No. 36 Maryland in Univer-sity Park, Penn., on Saturday at 4 p.m. for one of the top two spots. 
The 12 teams at the NCAA Championship will 
compete in two semifinal sessions of six teams each. 
The top three teams from each session compete 
in the 2014 Super Six field on April 19.
But the Gators are trying not to look that far 
ahead. 
“Of course we bring it up once in a while but 
Rhonda always tells us that we need to stay in the moment and so that’s what we’re doing although we want to look ahead,” junior Kytra Hunter said. “We really want to go back to Birmingham and get that national title especially after coming in second for SECs.”GyM , from page 14“My serve, I’ve been

� FITZGERALD GUARDING 
TOP OPPOSITION.
EDEN OTERO
Alligator Writer @edenotero_l
From 2010 until 2013, No. 4 
Florida faced the challenge of 
defending against midﬁ  elder Erin Fitzgerald when it played Northwestern.
But UF has its own Fitzger-
ald now.
Freshman Caroline Fitzger-
ald is the little sister to Erin Fitzgerald and has proven to be the defensive weapon that the Gators (12-2, 3-0 American Lacrosse Conference) needed to help ﬁ  ll the space that de-fensive players like Emily Do-hony, Sam Farrell, Jamie Reeg and Kayla Stolins left after graduating in 2013.
As a freshman, Fitzgerald 
has guarded the toughest of-fensive players in every game.
Against Syracuse, she 
played man-to-man coverage against Alyssa Murray — one of the top offensive players in college lacrosse — and held her to only two goals and one as-sist.
In UF’s season opener at 
No. 1 UNC, Fitzgerald had two ground balls and two draw controls. In a game where the Tar Heels beat the Gators 20-8, she was one of ﬁ  ve Florida players to win a draw control.
Since that game, Fitzgerald 
has continued to grow.
The Mount Sinai, N.Y., na-
tive has focused heavily on de-fending as a unit with the entire team for its game against No. 9 Johns Hopkins (10-1, 1-1 ALC) on Saturday at noon.
“We are game planning, 
watching ﬁ  lm,” Fitzgerald said. “We go out on the ﬁ  eld and practice against our offense.”
Like the rest of the team, 
Fitzgerald is looking for a win against the Blue Jays so the Gators will remain undefeated in the ALC. 
However, Hopkins won’t 
go down without a ﬁ  ght.The No. 9-ranked team has 
only lost one game in its 2014 season, and it was to a tough Vanderbilt team on Saturday.
Fitzgerald and the rest of 
the defense will have their hands full with Hopkins se-nior attacker Taylor D’Amore and senior midﬁ  elder Sammy Cermack. D’Amore is the Blue Jays’ leading player in goals (32) and draw controls (36), while Cermack leads the of-fense in ground balls (33) and caused turnovers (12).
If Florida can win its next 
three games, it would end with a perfect record in the ALC and become the No. 1 seed for the ALC conference tournament in May.
Fitzgerald said Florida is 
ready for the pressure that comes with being undefeated in conference play this late in the season.
“We’re looking to keep that 
alive, and that is going to be a struggle,” she said, “but it’s go-ing to be a good one.”
Freshman stout on defense
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ 
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa
Florida is arguably more eager for 
a win now than it has been all season. 
The Gators started the season on a 
22-game winning streak that included 
a ﬁ  ve-week stretch ranked No. 1.  
Since then, No. 6 Florida (31-8, 5-7 
Southeastern Conference) has gone 9-8 and has dropped four straight contests for the ﬁ  rst time since 2011 as it opens its three-game series against No. 19 Auburn (31-6-1, 6-3 SEC) to-night at 6.
“I think there’s a lot of change that 
can be made in every aspect,” fresh-man Delanie Gourley said. “You know pitching, hitting, ﬁ  elding, defense and we’ll be ready. We’re going to prepare and it’ll be a good weekend.” 
Despite the losing streak, coach 
Tim Walton said he’s not worried.
“There’s no panic in the coaching 
staff, there’s no panic in the players,” Walton said after Wednesday’s extra inning loss to FSU. “We did normal routine work.”Auburn most recently defeated 
then-No. 10 Kentucky at home in two of three games.
The Gators’ 
record lacks that positive mo-mentum the Ti-
gers will be riding into town. Prior to the start of its losing streak on March 28, Florida had not dropped back-to-back games all season.
“I think it has more to do with the 
opponents that we’ve played more than it has to do with us,” Walton said. “Are we where we want to be? No, but the season’s not over yet and I think our kids have a lot of athleticism and a lot of ﬁ  ght in them.” 
Despite the mid-season struggles, 
the team has made a conscious effort to not let its perseverance waver.
“We just have to clear it,” junior 
pitcher Lauren Haeger said. “I mean we practice hard, we go hard all the time so we just have to keep doing what we’re doing and not let it bother us.”UF looks to snap losing skid

UConn point guard Shabazz Napier was 
on a mission.
With 17.7 seconds left on the clock and 
Connecticut trailing Florida by only one 
point, the Huskies needed their senior leader and top scorer to pull one more miracle out of his pocket. 
On the previous offensive possession, 
Napier notched a four-point play to put his team back into contention.
While the Gampel Pavilion crowd stood in 
suspense and bit its nails, he dribbled down the court and studied his options.
About 10 seconds dwindled. Then, what 
Florida coach Billy Donovan calls to this day a “freak play” ensued.
Huskies forward DeAndre Daniels ran up 
to the elbow to set a pick on forward Casey Prather as Napier dribbled to his right, but center Patric Young helped on the pick-and-roll. The two Gators soon trapped Napier and caught the point guard in a bind.
But Napier, aware and agile, successfully 
split the double team, losing his handle but quickly regaining it. Pressed for time, he then forced an off-balance jumper at the elbow with about three seconds remaining.
Way off.Before Napier’s field-goal attempt clanked 
off the bottom-left region of the glass, all five Florida defenders rushed to the rim for the board.
“When a shot goes up, the tendency is to 
want to go in there and want to go rebound,” Donovan said. “We obviously ran in way too deep.”
It proved to be a fatal mistake.Before any Gator could jump, Daniels 
back-tapped the ball to an open Napier at the foul line.
“You’ve got to give him credit that he had 
the wherewithal just to keep the ball alive,” Donovan said. “I don’t know if he knew where he was tipping it to.”
As a late Prather frantically rushed to stick 
a hand in Napier’s face, the UConn guard was gifted one more opportunity. With victory on his mind and 0.4 seconds left on the clock, Napier pulled the trigger from about 15 feet out.
Bang.
■     ■     ■
For Florida, Dec. 2 seems like years ago.Since falling 65-64 to Napier’s buzzer-
beater on that chaotic night in Storrs, Conn., the Gators have won 30 consecutive games — good for a program record and the lon-gest streak in the nation. During that span, Florida achieved a perfect 18-0 Southeastern Conference regular-season record, won its conference tournament and reached its first Final Four since 2007. Aside from a sluggish start against Albany, UF has been a force to be reckoned with in the Big Dance, winning all of its tournament games by double-digit margins.
In the grand scheme of things, the UConn 
loss seemed like an afterthought — until Sun-day.
When Connecticut knocked off Michigan 
State 60-54 in the Elite Eight, it all came full circle. Saturday at 6:09 p.m. in AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, No. 1 overall seed Florida (36-2) will square off against seventh-seeded UConn (30-8) in the Final Four for a spot in Monday night’s national title game.
Following its buzzer-beating win against 
UF, UConn had its rough patches. Second-year Huskies coach Kevin Ollie saw his group lose eight games — six by 10 points or fewer — and fall outside of the AP poll by week 11 of the season.
But after an embarrassing 81-48 loss at 
Louisville on March 8, Connecticut turned the ship around and has won six of its past seven games.
Behind Napier’s leadership, the Huskies 
cruised through a difficult bracket in the East Regional, defeating 10-seed Saint Joseph’s in overtime 89-81, 2-seed Villanova 77-65, 3-seed Iowa State 81-76 and then the Spartans for perhaps their most impressive postseason victory. 
“I would probably say like ourselves, play-
ing them back in December, they’re a much, much better team today than when we played them,” Donovan said.
As different as both squads’ journeys to 
the Final Four have been, both are still tied to that fateful buzzer-beater on Dec. 2 and think back to it often.
“We took a lot from that game,” Ollie said. 
“The resiliency that we had, we got down in that game and came back. We played hard. We played scrappy.”
Added Donovan: “It was a game that re-
ally helped our team going forward.”
■     ■     ■
It’s the SEC Tournament title game. Ken-
tucky coach John Calipari calls a timeout as his team has the ball and trails Florida 61-60 with 14 seconds remaining. The Wildcats have one more chance to draw up a play and make something happen.
But the Gators knew they had to remain 
disciplined and stay with their man on de-fense instead of all going for the rebound like they did in the first UConn matchup which resulted in Napier’s game-winner.
“We just said, ‘Everybody box your man 
out, so they don’t hurt us on the second shot,’” senior point guard Scottie Wilbekin said.
On March 16, the Gators did not let his-
tory repeat itself. They have learned that it’s the second shot that often beats you — not the first one — in late-clock situations.
But in that contest, UF did not allow UK to 
get off even one shot on the final possession. After Wildcats guard Andrew Harrison wast-ed about 10 seconds of clock and then dished the ball to James Young, Wilbekin and sopho-more guard Michael Frazier II double-teamed the Kentucky wing. Young tripped and lost possession of the ball as time expired.
Florida made a good defensive read and 
Kentucky goofed, but it’s that ruthless men-tality to not allow second-chance points that has benefitted the Gators so much this year. Florida’s 61-60 victory in the SEC Tourna-ment title game was the perfect example of how much UF has tightened up its act defen-sively at the end of games.
Since falling to the Huskies, the Gators are 
3-0 in games decided by three points or fewer and on a final play in which their opponent has the last possession.
“Any time we’re in a situation like that, 
even if it’s a shot-clock situation,” Wilbekin said, “we say, ‘Box out. Don’t run to the rim.’”
■     ■     ■
 Wilbekin, perhaps Florida’s best on-ball 
defender, was not on the floor when Napier sealed UConn’s win on Dec. 2.
In fact, he did not even see the buzzer-
beater live.
During the final minutes of the contest, 
Wilbekin was in the visitor’s locker room get-ting treatment for his right ankle — an injury he suffered at the 3:01 mark when he went up for an offensive rebound on his missed jump-er and planted awkwardly on Connecticut guard Ryan Boatright’s foot. 
Because there was no television in the lock-
er room, Wilbekin learned the game’s result from Jack Pfaff, a UF assistant athletic direc-tor. 
Florida’s floor general did not watch Napi-
er’s victory jog to the locker room — or the UConn guard’s fist-pumping celebration as he returned to the floor. He did not watch his shell-shocked teammates walk off the court in disgust, knowing they let a quality win slip out of their hands.
“I just knew what the score was,” Wilbekin 
said. “It was definitely a disappointing loss.”
It was obviously a painful day for Wil-
bekin, but it’s one he could now leave in the past. 
After a four-month wait, he and fresh-
man point guard Kasey Hill, who missed the UConn game due to a high ankle sprain, will finally get their shot at revenge against Napi-er and the Huskies.
The “freak play” will forever live on, but 
Saturday night is a new chapter for both teams.
“The game was such a long time ago,” Wil-
bekin said. “They’re playing their best basket-ball right now, and I think we are doing the same. That’s what you have to do to be in this position at the Final Four. I don’t expect any-thing less than them to play their best game.”AP Photo

Scottie Wilbekin calls out a play during Florida’s 62-52 win against Dayton on Saturday in FedExForum in Memphis, Tenn. Wilbekin was in the 
locker room with a high ankle sprain when Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier hit his buzzer-beater shot to top Florida 65-64 on Dec. 2.
UConn remembers UF well.
The last time the two teams 
faced off, the Huskies won on a sec-
ond-chance buzzer-beater jump shot by senior point guard Shabazz Napier, handing the Gators their second loss of the season.
“We took a lot from that game,” 
Huskies coach Kevin Ollie said dur -
ing a teleconference Monday. “The resiliency that we had, we got down in that game and came back.  We played 
hard.  We played scrappy.”
UConn finished the regular sea-
son 24-7, but it went just 5-4 against teams who made it to the Big Dance, including two losses to eventual No. 4 seed Louisville.
Despite its lackluster record against 
top opponents in the regular season, East Region champion UConn has played better than its No. 7 seed rank-ing throughout the tournament. The Huskies head to Arlington, Texas, after topping No. 3 seed Iowa State 81-76 in the Sweet 16 and defeating No. 4 seed Michigan State 60-54 in the Elite Eight in Madison Square Garden.
While Napier, the most outstanding 
player of the East Regional, leads the Huskies with 18.1 points, 4.9 assists and 1.7 steals per game this season, DeAndre Daniels has had a breakout postseason. 
The junior forward is averaging 17 
points per contest since the NCAA tournament began. Against Iowa State in the East Regional semifinals, Dan-iels recorded his fourth double-double of the season by logging 27 points on 10-of-15 shooting and grabbing 10 re-bounds.
As coach John Calipari would say, Kentucky has seen a tweak in its 
performance heading into the post-season.
After dropping three of its final four 
regular season contests and becom-ing the first team in 34 years to drop out of the AP poll after being ranked No. 1 in the preseason, the Wildcats have been on fire as of late.
Kentucky cruised through its first 
two games of the SEC Tournament, beating LSU 85-67 in the quarterfinals and Georgia 70-58 in the semifinals, and was one play away from winning the SEC title over Florida.
Through the NCAA Tournament, No. 
8 seed Kentucky has had wins against No. 9 seed Kansas State (56-49), No. 1 seed Wichita State (78-76), No. 4 seed Louisville (74-69) and No. 2 seed Michigan (75-72). 
Freshman forward Julius Randle 
has posted a double-double in all four of Kentucky’s tournament games, av -
eraging 15.8 points and 12 boards per contest. Fellow freshmen Aaron Harri-son (16 ppg), Andrew Harrison (12.3 ppg) and James Young (10.5 ppg) are also averaging double-digit point totals throughout the NCAA tournament.
But while the Wildcats offense is 
flourishing down the stretch, they will be without a large cog of their defense with Willie Cauley-Stein doubtful to play against the Badgers on Saturday at 8:49 p.m. because of an ankle in-jury. 
The 7-foot sophomore leads Ken-
tucky with 106 blocks and 44 steals this season and averages 6.1 of UK’s 40.6 rebounds per game.
Wisconsin’s road to the Final Four 
has not been an easy one. 
The Badgers had the second-tough-
est strength of schedule this season, trailing only Kansas in the category. Despite the rigor, Wisconsin managed to post its first 30-win season since the 2007-2008 season.
The Badgers have kept their mo -
mentum going heading into the NCAA Tournament, outscoring their oppo -
nents by a combined score of 293-227.
Wisconsin has utilized the same 
starting lineup all season, and those five players account for 80 percent of UW’s points. In the NCAA Tournament, four of the Badgers’ starting five have posted at least two double-digit scor -
ing efforts.
Frank Kaminsky paces the Badgers 
on offense, scoring 14.1 points per game on 52.7 percent shooting.“He’s just a tough young man who 
really wants to be a player, who has physically and mentally matured into what he feels he’s comfortable with as far as his body and mind are con-cerned,” Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan said during a teleconference Monday. “He’s learned how to be stronger.   He’s 
learned some nuances defensively of positioning and balance.”
The 7-foot forward has enhanced 
his game down the stretch. Heading into No. 2 seed Wisconsin’s Final Four matchup against No. 8 seed Kentucky on Saturday at 8:49 p.m., Kaminsky has scored 18.5 points per contest and averaged six boards per game in the tournament.
In Wisconsin’s 64-63 overtime win 
against top-seeded Arizona, the junior posted his second double-double of the season by logging 28 points on 11-of-20 shooting and 11 rebounds.They MeetAgain� HE LEADS UF TO ITS FIRST

Billy Donovan was not sent from 
heaven to coach Florida’s basketball 
team. He is no miracle worker, mag-ic healer or instant ﬁ  x. On Saturday, he and the No. 1 seeded Gators will appear in their fourth Final Four in 14 seasons, but it took years for Don-ovan to turn water into wine.
Before reaching the Sweet 16 
in the 1998-1999 season, Dono-van limped his way to a 27-32 re-cord during his ﬁ  rst two years in Gainesville. Four years after Lon Kruger coached Florida into its ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference Champi-onship and its ﬁ  rst Final Four, ath-letic director Jeremy Foley was stuck with a 33-year-old coach whose only prior head coaching experience was with Marshall for two seasons.
But if there’s any word that best 
encapsulates Donovan’s coaching method, it’s “process.”
Back in his playing days at Provi-
dence, “Billy the Kid” managed to average only two points per game during his freshman campaign and just three per game the following year. When his mentor and now friend Rick Pitino took over the head coaching job for the Friars in 1985, Donovan ﬁ  nally came into his own — averaging 15.1 points per game as a junior and then 20.6 as a senior.
Providence’s 1987 squad, led by 
Donovan at the point guard posi-tion, climbed its way to the Final Four. Although the Friars fell to Jim Boeheim’s Syracuse squad in the national semiﬁ  nal matchup, Dono-van — a scrawny, 5-foot-11 kid from Long Island — ﬁ  nished his collegiate career with All-Big East ﬁ  rst team honors as well as an All-American honorable mention.
“I’ve never had in my life anyone work as hard to improve as him, in 35 years,” Pitino would later say of his pupil.
After a one-season NBA career 
with the New York Knicks, Dono-van began to use his knowledge from his playing career to transition into the coaching realm. And just like his Providence career, Dono-van’s career as Florida’s coach took a couple of years to get off the ground and ﬂ  ourish.
He brought in future-NBA talent 
in Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem to transform Florida from a pro-gram that averaged 11.5 wins per season before 1996 to a 22-win sea-son in 1998-1999. The very next year, Donovan brought back all but one starter to help his team make its ﬁ  rst national championship appearance in school history. 
Although Steve Spurrier had 
brought Florida football back onto the national scene with a national ti-tle of his own, Donovan was not far behind in his process of transforming the Gators’ basketball program into a winning one. Still, even with the unprecedented success on the court, Foley had a difﬁ  cult time drawing fans into the stands. So Donovan took a crack at that as well.
As soon as he arrived on campus 
in 1996, Donovan instituted the “Bil-ly D 3-on-3 Challenge,” which pitted him and two of his assistant coaches against three UF students. If the stu-dents could take down Donovan, Anthony Grant and John Pelphrey in two of three contests, they would each earn a free road trip with the Gators during the regular season.
For eight years, Donovan suited 
back up and took to the court as part of the annual challenge. Even as his assistants came and went, he was always out there for the students. After winning the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve, he and his coaches lost the next three. Either way, Donovan was winning over the hearts of the Rowdy Reptiles.
He showed he could get NBA-
level talent like Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer to stay and ﬁ  ght for a second-straight title in 2007. He showed he could with-stand the bad days as well as the good after settling for two straight NIT appearances immediately fol-lowing the championship years.
And then he showed he had the patience to build up another cham-pionship-caliber team while Ken-tucky coach John Calipari snagged nearly every top recruit en route to a 2012 national championship. Al-though Donovan wasn’t pulling in the players like Anthony Davis and Julius Randle, he was slowly assem-bling the right guys for his team.
Calipari has seven McDonald’s 
All-Americans on this year’s roster. Donovan has three — two of whom come off the bench if they see the court at all. But unlike Calipari, Don-ovan has groomed a team strong in every link of the chain. 
He took a potential one-and-
done center in Patric Young and transformed him into the face of the program. He took a troubled Scottie Wilbekin and molded him into what he called a role model for the com-munity as well as the SEC Player of the Year.
He took a beaten and battered 
Will Yeguete and gave him one ﬁ  -nal year to overcome the pain and achieve greatness. And he took a lost Casey Prather and helped him ﬁ  nd an identity and become one of the Gators’ most dangerous scoring threats.
Because to Donovan, success is 
not one-and-done. It’s a develop-ment. It’s a journey. It’s taking some-thing good and making it great.
For three years, Donovan has put 
together good teams that always found their way into the Elite Eight. But it took until this year to make this squad a championship one.
“When things don’t go your way, 
it causes you to pause and reﬂ  ect and to try to ﬁ  nd out a solution,” Donovan said. “I think one of the greatest things and one of the most difﬁ  cult things in life is when some-thing doesn’t go the way you want it to go [you must] legitimately ﬁ  nd the answer and the reason of why it didn’t go and make the correction.”
Well Billy, problem solved.
Donovan’s patience pays dividends throughout career
