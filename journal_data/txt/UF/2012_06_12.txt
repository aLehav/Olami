After a year of campaigning to raise UF 
tuition to the market rate, President Bernie 
Machen decided to lower the tuition in-crease request for the upcoming year from 15 percent to 9 percent.
The state set a 15 percent increase cap, 
which UF has requested and received for the past several years.
During this year’s legislative session, 
Machen and FSU President Eric Barron lobbied Gov. Rick Scott to approve a bill that would have allowed both universities to raise tuition to the market rate. 
Scott vetoed the bill in April.Machen said in his address to UF’s 
Board of Trustees on Friday that he under-stands these are difﬁ  cult times.
He said he is ready to pause on the no-
tion of using tuition increases to help bal-ance the $38.2 million in budget cuts dealt UF trustees pass budget 
with lower tuition hike

Diane McFarlin spent most of her adult life 
on the road between Sarasota and Gainesville, 
but for now she’s here to stay.
McFarlin, publisher of the Sarasota Herald-
Tribune and a 1976 alumna of UF’s College of 
Journalism and Communications, was selected 
as the new dean of the college.
“I just could not be prouder to be named 
dean of a school that is already so distin-guished,” she said.
As of Jan. 1, McFarlin will succeed John 
Wright, who served as interim dean since July 2006 and was named permanent dean in De-cember 2007.  As dean, McFarlin said she hopes to help 
manage partnerships with stakeholders in the college and explore multimedia opportunities, 
including the 21st Century Newsroom in Weimer Hall.
“We extend a hearty wel-
come to Diane,” advertising 
chairman John Sutherland 
wrote in an email. “She has the experience, expertise and leadership ability to help us continue our pursuit of excellence.”
Unlike other candidates for the dean’s posi-
tion, McFarlin doesn’t hold a master’s degree or a Ph.D.UF selects new journalism

With a little help, UF will light 
up Gainesville’s skies once again 
this Independence Day.
Fanfares and Fireworks, a 
community-oriented event cel-ebrating the Fourth of July, will return to UF after a year-long hia-tus due to lack of funding.
The College of Journalism and 
Communications and its division of multimedia properties are pre-
senting the July 3 event at UF’s 
Flavet Field.
“We very much wanted to 
bring it back,” said Randy Wright, 
the division’s executive director. 
“We didn’t want to cancel it last year, but we couldn’t afford it.”
The ﬁ  reworks display costs 
about $30,000, he said. 
The college paid for much of 
the event prior to budget cuts.
This year, the City of 
Gainesville, Gainesville Regional Utilities, Florida Credit Union 
and Plum Creek are sponsoring 
the event. Local bands will play live mu-
sic. 
Jan Rockey, 54, a program 
assistant at the department of mechanical and aerospace engi-neering, said she’s been going to Fanfares and Fireworks for years.
She said it’s always crowded, 
with lots of kids running around. 
She packs dinner and picnics in 
the grass with her daughter and grandchildren. 
Last time, they bought funnel 
cake from a vendor.  
“We love the ﬁ  reworks,” she 
said. “The ﬁ  reworks are the best part, and it’s the only [display] Gainesville has.”Fireworks will return to Flavet Field for July Fourth celebration

Leonard was charged in 2009 
with assault after allegedly shoot-
ing a man in the groin, but pros-ecutors dropped the case after the 
victim told authorities Leonard 
wasn’t the shooter.
A Montgomery woman filed a 
paternity suit against Leonard on Friday that identified him as the 
father of a girl who turned 1 last 
month.
Another woman sued him in 
2009 seeking unpaid child support 
for a girl who is now 4. A court or -
dered monthly payments of $305 by Leonard, who records show 
was working at a Walmart store at the time.
Auburn police said the week-
end shootings didn’t appear to have anything to do with some of 
the victims being former or current 
players on the football team, which won the national championship in 
2010.
Of the three wounded victims, 
John Robertson remained in criti-
cal condition after being shot in the head. Xavier Moss was re-
leased from the hospital. The third 
wounded victim was Eric Mack, a 
current football player who is ex-
pected to recover.
Slain were Edward Christian, 
who had to quit the team because 
of a lingering back injury, and La-
darious Phillips, who had previ-ously quit playing football. The other person killed was 20-year-
old Demario Pitts.

previously arrested on charges

Jon Silman failed the first assign-
ment he turned in to his future mentor.
Kelley Benham thought the Fall 
2010 magazine and feature writing 
article was “A” material, but then she 
found a misspelled name.
One fact error means an “F” for UF 
journalism students.
Silman, a Santa Fe College transfer 
who previously battled addiction, re-
did the article and won Benham over.
Almost two years later, the Tampa 
Bay Times enterprise editor found her -
self awake at 2 a.m. Friday to hear that Silman, 29, won the National Writing 
Championship of the Hearst Journal-
ism Awards Program in San Francisco.
He wasn’t the only Gator who did. 
Telecommunication senior Steven Gal-lo, 20, placed first in radio broadcast news. Eight students in each of the five categories competed for the college Pu-litzers and the $5,000 prizes.
Silman said his reward is getting to 
report as his job. He interned for a year and worked at the Alligator. Now he is a cops reporter at the Gainesville Sun.
“I love it so much, I don’t mind wak-
ing up at 7:30,” he said.
A profile about a widow who 
learned her late husband was gay land-ed him a finalist position in April.
Gallo got his spot with a feature 
about an opera-singing chef in Italy and a news story about the execution of convicted murderer Manuel Valle.
Gallo, who has worked with 
WUFT’s radio and television stations, was able to interview the son of the po-lice officer Valle was convicted of kill-ing. That story also won him national 
awards with the Society of Professional 
Journalists and the Radio Television Digital News Association.
Shortly before Gallo arrived in San 
Francisco Monday , he learned he’d be reporting on technology and privacy . He narrowed the topic to focus on how San Francisco police used cameras to scan nearby license plates.
He had less than two days to report 
and about one to compile and edit.
“It’s kind of like being pushed out of 
a plane with a parachute in a city — and for me an entire state and a coastline — that I’ve never been to before and being told to do a story in a day,” he said.
But knowing that he could do it was 
empowering, he said. It gives him hope 
for his internship with an NBC affiliate 
television station and his future career.
Donna Green-Townsend, features 
unit executive producer at WUFT-FM, said Gallo has the ability to get people to talk and a tireless work ethic.
She’s seen Gallo work in every 
WUFT position he could.
This experience is what Green-
Townsend thinks makes the difference for students.
“This is not just a little news lab,” 
she said. “This is the real deal.”Contact Clare Lennon at clennon@alliga-tor.org. Gators take first place in Hearst Awards

June 11, 1997 — After reviewing state 
law for two days, UF announces it is revok-
ing a student spouse ID card issued to a gay 
spouse. Christine Conover, the UF student 
who requested the card presented all the ma-terials required for a spouse card — a stu-dent ID, copies of their social security cards 
and a marriage certificate — and they were 
approved by the desk clerks. UF President John Lombardi said UF had no choice in the matter and cited state legislation.
June 10, 1982 — A high school senior at 
P .K. Yonge Laboratory School is challenging the ban on his underground student newspa-per as a violation of his constitutional rights. 
The student, Paul Donnelly, has been sus-
pended twice for distributing the paper, This School Is Ours, and missed the last two days of his senior year. Donnelly has contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the 
ban, and they are looking into the constitu-
tionality of the matter.
June 16, 1987 — University officials and 
student leaders announce the concealed weapons law they have been fighting will soon go into effect on the UF campus. The law allows licensed State University System students, faculty and staff to carry concealed 
stun guns on campus. Administrators have 
found there is nothing they can do to regu-late the electric guns, and they will have to change the university’s policy to comply 
with the new law.
June 12, 1984 — Attorneys for UF fraterni-
ty Pi Lambda Phi and UF reach an agreement 
in the alleged gang rape of a 17-year-old 
freshman by several Pi Lam members. The 
signed settlement imposes restrictions on the fraternity for two years, ends its little sister rush program and requires fraternity officials 
to hire a permanent live-in house parent.
June 13, 2002 — The UF Police Depart-
ment initiates the first K-9 unit in the Florida 
university system along with a high-tech 
Ford Expedition that will serve as a mobile 
command center. The new K-9 team consists of Officer Scott Summers and a 3-year-old German shepherd, Kim,  who is trained ex-
clusively for explosive device detection and

A new community class featuring the rapidly growing 
hobby of “adult treasure hunting” will begin this summer at 
Santa Fe College.
This outdoor treasure hunting game, known as geocach-
ing, has become a worldwide trend.
The hobby involves using a GPS device to find hidden 
containers called geocaches, which contain logbooks, at spe-cific locations.
Class instructor Chris Wagoner said there are millions of 
geocaches hidden throughout the world, including 1,500 in Gainesville, some of which are at UF and at SFC.
“I was astounded by the sheer number of them,” Wag-
oner said.
Wagoner, who has geocached all over the country and 
discovered more than 300 caches, said the containers range in hiding style and vary in their level of camouflage.
“They could be the size of a pill to a full-size ammo can,” 
he said.
Wagoner said geocaching is easy to do with a GPS, cell-
phone or Google Earth. People can register at geocaching.
com or opencaching.com.
The class at SFC, Geocaching for Fun and Fitness, will be-
gin July 14 and is open to people of all ages.
The class costs $24 per person and spots will be filled on a 
first-come, first-served basis.
University Police Department Capt. Jeff Holcomb began 
to geocache while camping with his family in 2009.
Holcomb said the more you geocache, the more aware 
you are to look for certain things.
Wagoner said some geocaches are even hidden in trees, 
disguised as bird nests.
“The secret is in camouflaging,” Wagoner said. “It’s fun 
trying to figure out where the hiding spot is.”SFC offering community geocache classWhen she was nominated, her first question was whether 
UF would consider someone without advanced degrees.
“My whole career has been in the profession,” she said.
However, she said, half of the top 10 journalism schools in 
the U.S. have deans whose backgrounds are in their profes-
sion, not academia.
She said this trend is indicative of current challenges in 
the field — the face of journalism is changing, and colleges 
want leaders who have experience dealing with those par -
ticular problems.
McFarlin also thinks UF was looking for a dean with lead-
ership experience.
As former executive editor of the Gainesville Sun, presi-
dent of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and 
managing editor and publisher of the Sarasota Herald-Tri-
bune, she said, “I know what comes with a position like that, both the respect and the great reward.”
Mike Foley , a professor in the journalism department, 
thinks it was a bold decision.
“She’s not your traditional academic,” he said. “She’s the 
consummate professional.”
After graduating from UF in 1976, McFarlin started her 
career as a reporter for the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, where 
she was named managing editor by the time she was 31.
She left to become executive editor of the Gainesville Sun 
in 1987 but returned to the Herald-Tribune three years later 
as executive editor. McFarlin has been the publisher of the Herald-Tribune since 1999.
Foley , who has known McFarlin for more than 25 years, 
said the selection comes at the right time for her and the col-lege, which is ready to help pass her experience to students.
“We continue to try to make sure that we are preparing 
students for the brave new world of journalism, and she’s on the front lines,” Foley said.
Under McFarlin’s direction, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune 
launched a 24-hour cable news channel in 1995, one of the first of its kind.
Although McFarlin’s primary background is in print me-
dia, telecommunications chairman David Ostroff said he’s glad she has some experience with television.
“It’s going to be a learning curve for all of us,” he said.Ostroff said all of the candidates were told the college is in 
dire need of more faculty. He’s looking forward to expanding in that respect, as well as working with the dean to enhance 
the graduate multimedia program and the TV production 
facilities.
“We’re delighted to have somebody that already has a great feeling for the college,” he said.  
McFarlin will stay with the Herald-Tribune for another 
three weeks. Then she  plans to travel, making visits to other journalism programs and attending conferences to prepare herself for her new job with the Gator Nation.
She’s looking forward to getting to know the faculty and 
students and welcomes the challenge of leading one of the top journalism schools in the country.
“I am happiest when I’m on the learning curve,” she 
said.

With the change, Machen said he will have to find an-
other $5 million from additional resources, which he did 
not name.
The trustees approved the university’s proposed bud-
get and tuition increase during their meeting.
Student Body President Tj Villamil said he was pleased 
that Machen listened to the student voice. At a meeting Thursday, he voted against a 15 percent increase, citing concerns for students who didn’t qualify for enough need-based financial aid and couldn’t afford a 15 percent tuition hike.
He said Friday that he thought the 9 percent increase 
was a perfect compromise.
“We have to meet in the middle,” 
Villamil said.
A student carrying 30 credit hours 
would have had to pay an additional $608.70 with the 15 percent increase. But at the meeting on Friday , Machen said the 9 percent increase would cost about $365.
He said UF can still be a leader in 
higher education and understand the 
tough times people are facing.
“I think it will be good for us to do this,” he said.Machen, who took office in 2004, also announced that 
he plans to step down and will help the board search for his replacement. His contract ends Dec. 31, 2013.
In December, the board extended his contract by one 
year without a salary raise.
A search committee, consisting of trustees, stakehold-
ers, students and alumni, will be formed around July to find the next president.

The UF Institute on Aging received 
a $5.2 million grant from the National 
Institutes of Health’s National Insti-
tute on Aging to continue research on 
physical disability in older adults.
Dr. Marco Pahor, director of the 
UF Institute on Aging, said UF is 
among 14 other U.S. institutions re-
ceiving the award.
The grant, which will be disbursed 
over five years, took effect April 1, Pahor said.
The money will be used for re-
search resources,  recruiting junior scholars and researchers and con-ducting studies on older adults, he 
said.
The grant is a renewal of another 
five-year award that established the 
UF Pepper Older Americans Inde-pendence Center in 2007.
Pahor said the grant’s renewal is a positive testament to the work the center has completed since then.
According to the center’s website, 
18.1 percent of Floridians are at least 
60 years old, which is the largest pro-
portion in any U.S. state.
UF’s Institute on Aging focuses on 
how to maintain these older adults’ 
independence and 
avoid disability, Pa-
hor said.
One of the cen-
ter’s current projects 
is researching the 
effects of physical activity on disabil-ity in older adults. 
He said 16,000 participants around 
the country were recently selected 
and he expects results to be released in 2013.
The center is also working on 
studies involving the effects of anti-oxidants in red wine on older adults and testosterone in older men.UF Institute on Aging  gets

Florida A&M University’s Board of 
Trustees members questioned the leader -
ship abilities of the university’s president 
Thursday.
Eight of the 12 trustees voted that they 
had no confidence in President James H. Ammons during a routine board meeting.
FAMU has been under scrutiny for haz-
ing following the death of drum major Robert Champion in November. 
Since then, 11 members of the band have 
been charged with felonies for allegedly 
beating Champion to death.
However, Ammons is determined to 
continue as president and repair the uni-
versity’s image.
“I hear the message that the board has 
sent to me through its vote and I take it 
very seriously,” he wrote in an emailed 
statement. 
“I pledge to the board, faculty, students, 
staff and alumni that I will fix the problems at FAMU.”Other problems facing the university 
have been an investigation of fraud in the band’s finances, issues with accreditation and graduation rates, and findings that 
showed more than 100 members of the band were not students enrolled in the uni-
versity, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Ammons is the tenth president of the 
university. 
When he was appointed in 2007, FAMU 
was facing fiscal problems and was on pro-bation by the Southern Association of Col-leges and Schools. 
During Ammon’s first year as president, 
the university had its first clean audit in three years and was removed from proba-
tion, according to the university’s website.

About 15 people enjoyed lo-
cal teachers’ art on display at the 
“Beyond the Classroom” exhibi-
tion that opened Thursday.
The pieces in the Mezzanine 
Gallery, all of which were made 
by local teachers, have created a 
good energy inside the Thomas 
Center at UF, said exhibition in-staller Jana Middleton.
“The exhibit shows what art 
teachers do outside of being an 
art teacher. It reflects the rest of their lives,” said Sherrie Petti-
grew, an artist and curator for the show.
She has known some teachers 
featured in the exhibit for more 
than 27 years.
“We are a tight group that has 
been through a lot together,” Pet-
tigrew said. “We are an endan-
gered species.”
The show featured multiple 
art media, from pencil drawings 
and photography to sculptings.

ca Coker, teachers at A. Quinn Jones Center and Sidney Lanier Elementary School hook rugs to-
gether.
“We drink some wine and do some hooking,” said Coker, who 
has been rug hooking since 2000.
In 2013, Alachua art teachers’ works will be exhibited again when the Thomas Center opens its galleries in the fall as part of 
its October show, said Debbie

Students looking to get 
their bicycles fixed will have 
to push them a little farther 
than the bushes outside of 
the Reitz Union Colonnade, but they might break less of a sweat.
UF’s Free Bike Repair 
opened in a new location Monday, moving into the Reitz Union and its air con-ditioning.
The new location is in the 
same room as the Outfitter, across the hall from Subway on the ground floor of the 
Reitz Union.
“No one wants to stand 
out in the sun,” said Jackie 
Matthews, Free Bike Repair coordinator.
Funding for the relocation 
came from Student Govern-ment. The new location has a new bike rack, a new air compressor and adapters at-
tached to the exterior of the 
building, Matthews said.
The adapters will allow 
students to fill up their tires 
any time — even when the 
bike repair is closed.
Daniel Harcha, a 22-year 
old mechanical engineering 
senior and manager of Free 
Bike Repair, said the staff 
found out about the move at the beginning of Spring se-mester.
He said bike repair hours 
will be shortened for the rest of summer to Monday, Thursday and Friday from 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. 
Free Bike Repair will be 
open five days a week this fall.

Students need to know 
details of budget
It would be an understatement to say that last week’s 
Board of Trustees meetings were eventful.
Of course, as many of you have heard by now, UF Pres-
ident Bernie Machen will retire at the end of 2013. While this 
may come as a surprise to some, his retirement from UF was expected due to the approaching expiration of his contract.
It was also decided that UF would no longer be participat-
ing in the National Merit Scholarship program due to the lack of control UF has over who qualiﬁ  es for the scholarship.
However, of greater controversy was Machen’s announce-
ment that the annual 15 percent tuition increase will be slashed to 9 percent this year.
Given Machen’s recent push to allow tuition increases 
greater than 15 percent at UF last semester, this sudden re-
versal was quite unexpected.
While this change might appease many student groups 
concerned about tuition hikes, it raises even more questions 
about the ﬁ  nancial future of UF.
A lowering of the expected tuition increase from 15 per-
cent to 9 percent creates a budget shortfall of about $5 mil-
lion.
UF administrators assured the trustees that these addi-
tional funds would come from “outside sources.”
However, what exactly are these “outside sources?”Do they plan to cut into the budget reserves? Do they plan 
to raise $5 million from private sources?
First, we believe it is important for the students to know 
why there was a sudden switch in policy goals in regards to 
tuition increases. While the change might be pleasing, it does 
not solve our budget woes.
Next, we want the administration to be clear about where 
they plan to make up the $5 million shortfall rather than us-ing vague terms like “outside sources.”
If tuition revenue does not meet the costs of the university, 
this leaves university services, faculty, staff and various other 
programs on the chopping block, especially if the $5 million 
cannot be found.
The Student Body does not need to be appeased by prom-
ises of lower tuition increases.
The Student Body deserves to know that its administra-
tion has a plan to not only keep the university going, but growing.
We have consistently argued over the past few months 
that when it comes to university funding and tuition increas-
es, the real ﬁ  ght is in Tallahassee.
At the same time, we should expect a transparent admin-
istration.
We understand that everyone is in a budget crunch right 
now, but we hope that UF doesn’t bite off more than it can chew with failed promises.Learn the truth beyond history textbooks
Like any modern society, we depend on schools to 
help us navigate through life. Our education is paramount to our ability to reason, and we apply 
our knowledge to help us solve problems. However, a couple of months ago a stark realization hit me — in every country, even in the U.S., a certain level of propa-ganda exists within our curriculum.
What we’re taught in school doesn’t follow the strict 
limitations of history. Important information can be omitted or completely dropped in the name of main-taining a particular ideology about U.S. history.
Recently, I read “Women, Race and Class,” by Angela 
Davis. In this work, Davis details the abolitionist move-ment and how it was entwined with the women’s rights movement.
The author discusses all of the well-known ﬁ  gures 
involved in the abolitionist movement, including Fred-erick Douglass, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott. What is often not mentioned is the divide between the abolitionist and women’s suffrage movements.
For instance, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was a 
former abolitionist, ended up not supporting the black man’s right to vote. In reference to extending the rights of African-Americans, Stanton stated, “I say no; I would not trust him with my rights; degraded, oppressed him-
self, he would be more despotic … than ever our Saxon 
rulers are.”
Unfortunately, that side of Stanton was never pre-
sented in our history books. Until I read several ques-tionable quotes from Stanton, I had always upheld her 
as a pure and faithful ﬁ  ghter for human equality. Now, 
I am questioning many of the ﬁ  gures I was taught to idolize in my youth.
In January, an article ran in the Hufﬁ  ngton Post about 
the Tennessee Tea Party and its campaign to “Show the Sunnier side of Slavery.” The main idea was to change history textbooks to describe the founding fathers as not inclined to slavery.
If you’ve read our Con-
stitution, you know that is 
far from true. 
The article also mentions 
how the Texas Board of 
Education has revised text-
books to teach the “positive 
side of slavery.” 
If that wording doesn’t scramble your brain, I don’t 
know what will.
The blatant racist revisionism that is occurring in our 
education system is troubling. Slavery was a dark time in our history, and it should be taught as such. 
We can’t live in a society that gloriﬁ  es the victory of 
throwing tea into the harbor while obscuring the cruel 
period of slavery.
It makes me wonder what else has been changed in 
our history books and what other historical lies have 
been written. 
The continual deceit of our students will lead to a 
dumber and more ignorant nation.
The promotion of false personas will only end in the 
deiﬁ  cation of all-too-human ﬁ  gures.
Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson 
and Ulysses S. Grant all owned slaves.
These men were far from perfect, and exalting them 
to false standards will minimize their true achievements and disrespect their memory.
Don’t let revisionism affect your knowledge of the 
world.
Read, learn and apply what you discover to your 
life.
In a time when our heads are obscured with falsities, 
it is your responsibility to learn the truth.

Like many of us, I thought I 
had heard every last word 
about the Trayvon Martin 
killing. The events that led to the 
shooting, the reaction of the com-munity and the personal lives 
of both Martin and his shooter, 
George Zimmerman, have been 
examined exhaustively by the na-tional and local media and subject-ed to the full spectrum of political 
and personal opinions.
I’m ready for a trial and, hope-
fully, some closure for the Martin 
family. For the most part, I’m done reading about the whole thing un-
til something new happens.
Or so I thought.
I was unprepared when I saw a 
photograph of the paper shooting target produced by the Hiller Ar-
mament Company of Virginia — 
so unprepared that I momentarily 
lost control of my “inside voice” and spoiled a perfectly cordial lunch with a string of outraged 
profanity.
The target is a black silhouette 
on a white background, depict-
ing a person wearing a hooded sweatshirt holding an iced tea with 
Skittles protruding from a front 
pocket. Obviously, this is meant to 
be Trayvon Martin on a shooting target meant for a gun range.
It would be an understatement 
to say that I ﬁ  nd this revolting. Even more revolting, as I show people the image of the target, I’m met with laughter as often as dis-gust. I try not to recoil too much when someone sees the picture and laughs. I just have to ask, “How is this funny?”
I come to the conclusion that 
the shrugging answer to the pre-
vious question is the result of de-
sensitization. Chefs don’t feel heat, 
smokers don’t smell each other and apparently constant bombard-ment by the national news media 
causes sociopathic behavior by 
making human beings into talking 
points. Martin stops being a dead teenager and becomes a symbol to both sides of the predictable parti-
san divide.
The media’s response to the 
police reaction of not arresting 
Zimmerman began a political back-and-forth that removed hu-
manity from the equation, and 
turned both the victim and the 
shooter into two-dimensional cari-catures. Martin was neither a thug nor an angel. Martin was 17 years 
old. Think back to when you were 
17 — it tends to be a rough year.
Zimmerman is neither a mur-
derer nor a victim. He’s a guy who 
instigated a ﬁ  ght, started losing 
and pulled a gun. There are many 
names for a person who does this, 
but not murderer, not victim. Martin is not a symbol, but a kid whose death reminds me not to be 
confrontational with strangers be-
cause I might get shot.
For another example, in Janu-ary 2011, 
Jared Lee 
Loughner 
shot 19 peo-
ple, wounding 13, including Ari-zona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and 
killed six using a “high-capacity 
magazine” in his 9mm pistol. He 
ﬁ  red 30 rounds before stopping to reload, when he was subdued and disarmed by members of the 
crowd at a public speaking event 
for Giffords. The event, an undeni-
able tragedy, inevitably became a debate about whether the Second Amendment included the right to 
bear arms that hold 33 bullets and 
ﬁ  t in your jacket pocket.
By May, I was reading a story 
about a gun enthusiast named 
Nick Leghorn, who was doing an 
experiment to try to determine 
what went wrong, not in terms of 
Loughner’s mental health but his inability to reload the 32-round magazine before someone stopped 
him. The implication is that Lough-
ner should have been able to shoot 
more people, and the purpose of Leghorn’s experiment is to prevent the next Loughner from having the 
same problem.
Six dead people, including a 
9-year-old girl and 13 wounded — 
including Giffords — and this is the reaction from some people? Why couldn’t he reload fast enough?
I don’t blame these people who 
make Martin targets and run reload experiments for being ideological-ly stunted. Most of them probably haven’t been exposed to much re-ality for the last decade or two, as most of them probably watch the same news channel every morning and night.
By dividing the media into 
rigid categories of “conservative” and “liberal,” we have changed the function and meaning of “the news” by forcing it to align with 
what is, in reality, strictly opinion. 
The closest thing now to tradi-
tional notions of the press are fact-checking websites like PolitiFact and rogue online publications like 
WikiLeaks, whose sole purpose is 
to provide actual truths.
Major news networks today 
have no interest whatsoever in re-
porting facts unless those facts ﬁ  t 
nicely with their chosen political 
narrative. I ﬁ  nd it outrageous that 
the 10 p.m. news has been replaced by Bill O’Reilly and Rachel Mad-dow.
While I’m more likely to agree 
with Maddow’s opinions based on my political positions, I don’t confuse them with facts. For facts, I have to go to PolitiFact after “The 
Daily Show” and see what actually 
happened.
When we substitute opinion for 
information, we lose the middle 
ground of informed opinion.

There’s a certain level of danger in men-
tioning anything on the Internet. One link falls into the hands of the wrong per-
son and before you know it, innocent pictures or comments get turned into giant jokes.
This time the giant jokes spawned their own 
problems.
Last week, Brian Presley, an actor, took a 
red-eye ﬂ  ight straight to Embarrassment City. According to a series of tweets from model Me-lissa Stetten, Presley drunkenly hit on her a few times during the ﬂ  ight.
Presley is married, has a 5-year-old son and 
is so devoutly Christian he even tweets the praises of Joel Osteen. He battled an addiction problem many years ago and is now complete-
ly sober.
Obviously, you can spot the differences be-
tween these two stories. Stetten live-tweeted 
the entire exchange, which included discover-ing that he was actually married — although 
she claimed Presley said he was “engaged to 
another actress, but it didn’t work out because they didn’t ‘mesh well’ together.”
She also said he consumed “three Heinekens 
and is wasted” in response to one of her Twitter followers pointing out the fact that he’s been in recovery for alcoholism for about a year and a half.
Was Presley just a scumbag who didn’t get 
away with adultery, or was he wrongly ac-cused?
Once this story broke, Presley ﬁ  red back in a 
post on his Facebook page:
“Sobriety, God, & My Family are the most 
important things in my life! My Wife Rocks, My Kids Rock, and Sobriety Rocks!!!”
I hate when arguments descend into “he 
said, she said” debates. Especially when they’re between celebrities. And it’s also especially bad 
when they’re solely online. 
There’s no way to tell who is telling the truth 
unless other witnesses chime in — and even 
then, no one knows if they’re just jumping on the bandwagon.
At the same time, do you remember all of 
those college sports scandals that claimed the young females in-
volved in the claims 
were lying about be-ing raped? Yeah. Not a bright time in our crim-inal justice system.
Caiden Cowger is 
a 14-year-old with a radio-style YouTube 
show. That’s pretty impressive, right? Down-
side is that it’s a conservative talk show broad-
cast from West Virginia.
He claims that becoming a homosexual is 
a conscious choice made by the individual. Cowger also berates the president for making 
kids gay and for encouraging that lifestyle by 
saying it’s OK.
Clearly Cowger must have some sort of 
understanding of the Internet if he can broad-
cast his own show to  hundreds of fans. So he 
should have understood the ramiﬁ  cations of his slightly archaic words.
Shortly after that particular video was up-
loaded, Cowger’s YouTube account was hacked 
and closed. Cowger’s website gives a snippet 
of an email from whoever did the deed:
“Just to let you know, I ripped a bunch of 
your videos from Youtube before you threw a 
s**t ﬁ  t and closed your account. I’m uploading 
them to my own personal webspace and will be tearing you apart in my article on (a web-site I do not want to give publicity to) and get paid for doing it and there’s f**k all you can do 
about it.”
This hacking is another instance of online 
vigilantes taking punishment into their own 
hands.
Should Stetten have put her phone away in-
stead of potentially damaging a man’s career 
and personal life?
Should Cowger’s unfortunate point of view 
be allowed to continue instead of being tempo-
rarily removed from his channel?
Just be careful with what you put online. At 
this point, who knows where it’ll end up.

UF has partnered with the Samuel P. Harn 
Museum of Art to introduce a new course that 
gives students the opportunity to create and dis-play their environmental artwork on campus.
The one-credit course, “DIY Campus Eco-
Art,” is open to students of all majors and will begin Summer B.
The course will teach students about Florida’s 
ecosystems and teach how to combine art and 
science.
Eric Segal, the education curator of academic 
programs at the museum and co-instructor of 
the course, said the projects will stay in the lab throughout the summer and into the fall.
“It is a chance to take your learning outdoors 
and to do something with real-world impact that is by learning about Florida’s natural environ-ment,” Segal said.
Students in the course will work on an art 
project that will enhance the natural environ-
ment around it.
Once the artwork is completed it will be in-
stalled in the Natural Area Teaching Laboratory, 
a 60-acre tract located near the entomology and nematology building.
The course is also a part of Creative B, a sum-
mer program that aims to raise cultural activity at UF, and will provide students with a small 
budget to purchase the materials needed to com-
plete their projects.
Assistant extension scientist and co-instruc-
tor of the course Jennifer Gillett-Kaufman said 
the class will meet at the 60-acre environmental 
teaching lab for most of the semester.
“What we’re really trying to do is get people 
to look at our ecosystems that we have here in 
Florida and find ways of putting sustainable art 
out,” Gillett-Kaufman said.
The course is divided into two sections and 
both will be team-taught by Segal and Gillett-
Kaufman. The two sections are ENY 4905 and 
HUM 2930.
Gillett-Kaufman said she wants every stu-
dent on campus to come out to the Natural Area Teaching Lab to use and enjoy.
“Come and take it because you never know 
when a course like this is going to be offered again,” she said.DIY art class offered Summer B

James Griffin was watching TV 
with his dog Lily early Monday 
afternoon when he heard what he 
thought was a tree branch fall on his apartment.
The 50-year-old walked out of 
his door at the Cottages on Market 
Street expecting to find roof dam-
age and a rogue oak branch. In-stead, he saw his neighbor’s kitch-en window engulfed in flames.
Emergency rescue workers re-
sponded to the fire at 725 SE Fifth Ave., unit No. 725, at 12:49 p.m.  Griffin shared the cottage with two other tenants.
Outside, the damaged apart-
ment’s resident, recent UF gradu-ate Mimi Seldner, and her boy-friend, Lee Johnson, embraced each other as they cried. Their dogs, Lola and Bratwurst, were trapped inside when the fire start-ed.
Gainesville Fire Rescue is in-
vestigating the cause of the fire, investigator Kelly DeRasmo said. 
The fire was contained to the 
kitchen of the apartment it started in.
Lieutenant paramedic Sean 
Campbell, one of the first on the scene, said the fire was extin-guished quickly enough to pre-vent it from ruining the cottage.
Joni McBride, Seldner’s 
67-year-old neighbor, rested near -
by in a lawn chair. Its plum-col-ored finish matched the cottage’s unblemished exterior.
“I thought the dogs weren’t 
inside,” she said. “Those poor ba-bies.”Apartment fire claims

Slow Internet could be a thing of the past for 
Gainesville residents living or working in the Inno-
vation District east of campus.
GRUCom, a Gainesville Regional Utilities tele-
communications division, and UF agreed Monday 
to bring gigabit broadband connections to the dis-
trict.
The new gigabit network will provide connection 
speeds of one gigabit per second, which is about 100 
times faster than standard DSL or cable services, ac-
cording to a press release.
The Internet option will be available at the end of 
June and will extend to other parts of the district as 
the area develops, according to the release.
GRU General Manager Bob Hunzinger said in 
a statement GRU will support entrepreneurial and technological developments in the district with the new broadband connections.
The Internet service will be available to residents 
for an introductory price of $99 per month, which includes 50 megabits per second of service. Rates 
are determined on an individual basis, according to 
GRUCom’s website.
UF students, faculty and staff in the district will 
have remote access to on-campus networks.
The initiative is part of the University Commu-
nity Next Generation Innovation Project, or Gig.U, which will bring high-speed networks to U.S. uni-versities.
“This is something that was involved in all the 
major leading research universities in the country,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. “We felt it was something we needed to be a part of as well.”

 Sprinter Jeff Demps has the fastest all-conditions 
time for the NCAA in the 100 meter, senior Gray 
Horn has won the decathlon title in every South-
eastern Conference Championship he’s competed in and Florida men’s 4x100 meter relay team set the sec-
ond-fastest collegiate time earlier in 
the season. However, none of them 
competed at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
  Despite missing out on three pos-
sible ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nishes, Florida still 
edged LSU by two team points to win its ﬁ  rst NCAA outdoor title.
  “I can’t tell you how proud I am of this group of  Florida wins ﬁ  rst 
NCAA Outdoor title  There was nothing junior about what the third-year 
Gators accomplished Sunday.
  With Florida’s Super Regional sweep of North Car-
olina State, the UF junior class will play in its third College World Series in three seasons. It’s a remarkable feat coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan tried to put into perspective.
  “Obviously , Omaha is a thing we talk about,” O’Sullivan 
said. “But I can’t say enough — it’s extremely difﬁ  cult to get 
to this point. It is extremely difﬁ  cult.”
  Reaching the College World Series has proven tough 
enough for the title-less Gators, and this season was no ex-ception. Perhaps the most challenging step for Florida was its 9-8 victory Sunday. In what was likely the last home ap-pearance for UF’s six drafted juniors, there were four lead 
changes, and N.C. State rallied to tie Florida three times.
  The Gators did not escape with a win until they plated 
two runs in the top of the 10th and only surrendered one to 
the Wolfpack in the bottom half of the inning.
  “That kind of game, and how it worked out, that’s what 
I came back for,” senior Preston Tucker said. “If I could pick a game I wanted to go out with here at home, I think that’s 
the one.”
  While Tucker and the seniors fell short of reaching the 
College World Series in 2009, all the juniors know is Omaha. 
However, Mike Zunino and his fellow juniors, like every other player that has donned a Florida baseball uniform, have never won a national title.
  Advancing to the pinnacle of col-
lege baseball three consecutive times is a monster feat. The Gators had only been to Omaha ﬁ  ve times in the  
50-year history of the College World 
Series before 2010.
  But if you end the season empty-
handed, it was all in vain — just ask 
the Buffalo Bills.
  Florida’s current squad is the best team in the 98-year his-
tory of the program. Their record may not reﬂ  ect that, but the Gators have nine MLB Draft picks on their roster. They have two years of College World Series experience — including 
the sting of last year’s loss to South Carolina — and they are 
the nation’s No. 1 team for a reason.
  UF has dealt with high expectations since January, and 
the glare has only intensiﬁ  ed in the heat of the June sun. The Gators’ championship window is closing, and this is their last chance to punctuate a historic run with a satisfying end.
  “For us to get back to this point,” O’Sullivan said, “it was 
something we set out to do, but it was not easy . Getting to the ﬁ  nal eight is never easy.”
  Florida has one ﬁ  nal crack at glory in Omaha, and the 
road is not getting any easier.

� FLORIDA SWEEPS N.C. STATE IN 
NCAA GAINESVILLE SUPER REGIONAL.

 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 The Gators’ roster boasts nine new MLB 
prospects, but Florida relied on more than its 
highly-regarded upperclassmen to advance to a third straight College World Series.
  “Our guys battled,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said. “Each guy did just enough. It was a great team effort.”
  Two Gators who have signiﬁ  cantly con-
tributed to the team effort this postseason are freshmen Josh Tobias and Casey Turgeon. To-
bias has mostly earned praise from O’Sullivan 
for his defense and deservedly so. He has played error-free baseball this postseason, including a run-saving effort in the fourth in-ning Sunday.
  With runners on ﬁ  rst and second, Wolfpack 
second baseman Matt Bergquist hit a sharp grounder down the third-base line. Tobias made a diving play to stop the ball and tagged the bag with his glove for the third out.
  Despite a noteworthy defensive effort, To-
bias overshadowed his glove work with his bat.  In the top of the ninth, Tobias led off the 
inning with a double to center ﬁ  eld. N.C. State center ﬁ  elder Jake Fincher caught the 
ball while diving, but could not complete the 
catch.
  “I thought Fincher had a really good beat 
on that ball in center,” O’Sullivan said. “The 
ﬁ  rst couple of steps, I thought he was going to 
catch it. We were just fortunate that when the glove hit the ground, the ball popped out.”
  Nolan Fontana bunted Tobias over to 
third, and after an intentional walk to Preston Tucker, Tobias scored the go-ahead run on a 
Mike Zunino sacriﬁ  ce ﬂ  y to center ﬁ  eld. The 
Wolfpack tied the score up 7-7 in the bottom of the ninth to send the game into extra innings.
  Daniel Pigott put the Gators up 8-7 with a 
lead-off solo homer to right ﬁ  eld in the 10th, but Florida’s freshmen tallied the eventual winning run.
  Casey Turgeon followed Pigott’s at-bat 
with a single — his third hit in a 3-for-5 day — and Justin Shafer, who ﬁ  nished the game 2 
for 3 with two RBI, bunted Turgeon into scor-
ing position. Junior Vickash Ramjit lined out to shortstop, bringing Tobias to the plate with two outs.
  Down in the count 0-2, Tobias hit a ball into 
the right-ﬁ  eld grass for a single. As Turgeon  Tobias, freshmen prove 
clutch in Gators' return to College World Series

With a potential third-straight Omaha ap-
pearance on the line, the top-ranked Gators 
received a bit of help from the dark clouds hovering above McKethan Stadium.
Florida, facing North Carolina State’s 
freshman southpaw in Carlos Rodon, need-ed a good offensive effort against the Golden Spikes Award finalist Sunday afternoon.
The rain ended Rodon’s day early in a 9-8 
Florida victory against the Wolfpack.
Rodon entered the game versus Florida’s 
Jonathon Crawford tied for third in the na-tion in strikeouts. Rodon and Crawford had not allowed any hits heading into the bottom 
of the third, but a two-hour, 23-minute rain 
delay put the game on hold for the second day in a row.
While Crawford tossed only 17 pitches 
before play stopped, Rodon had 40 and the delay prevented any chance for his return.
N.C. State coach Elliot Avent favored 
postponing the game until Monday to pre-vent a repeat of Saturday’s two rain delays 
that approached three hours.
 “I won’t speak for either club, but I will 
say that each manager, each coach, will prob-
ably have feelings based on what affects his team in his mind one way or another,” NCAA game representative Bob Warn said.
Avent pulled Rodon, but Gators coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan kept Crawford in the game due to his low pitch count. O’Sullivan, known for protecting his pitchers, had no qualms about giving Crawford the ball.
“I knew that question would come up 
and I knew there would be a lot of people 
questioning the move,” O’Sullivan said. “All 
I know is we’ve only had one pitcher throw over 100 pitches all year long and we take care of our arms. You get to this time of year and when you protect kids’ arms, you have the opportunity to do that.”
Although Crawford allowed three earned 
runs in 3.2 innings, he delayed Florida’s need to burn a reliever in a game that forced 
O’Sullivan to use seven pitchers. N.C. State 
used five pitchers in the high-scoring con-test.
Right-hander Anthony Tzamtzis re-
placed Rodon in the fourth and the Florida offense erupted for four runs including a Preston Tucker right-field homer, which tied the game at one. Tzamtzis survived five bat-ters and registered one out.
“We were definitely going to battle. 
We knew that we were going to get there best and that was the thing,” Tucker said. “Whether it was him or somebody else, we knew it was going to be tough.”
Once the starting pitchers exited the 
game, an offensive outburst ensued with four lead changes.
“I’m drained,” Tucker said. “Mentally 
and physically that was one of the most ex-hausting games I’ve played in.”14, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, JUNE 12, 2012

rounded third, Tobias rounded first. Tobias 
drew the attention of the N.C. State defense and got caught in a rundown to ensure Tur -
geon scored successfully.
“[Tobias’ postseason success] speaks vol-
umes to how far he’s come as a player this year,” O’Sullivan said.
“If he had not had that set back with his (broken) hamate bone, you probably would have seen this a little bit earlier than the latter 
part of the season.”
While Tobias proved clutch Sunday, Tur -
geon and Shafer have followed up their South-
eastern Conference All-Tournament Team se-lections with good postseason play.
Turgeon earned Most Outstanding Player 
honors in the NCAA Gainesville Regional and has hit .474 with six runs in five NCAA Tour -
nament games.Shafer is batting .313 with five RBI and a 
.421 on-base percentage during the postsea-
son.
“It’s unbelievable to come in here as a fresh-
man and play ,” Turgeon said. “I’ve learned 
a lot. I just want to thank the older guys for teaching me pretty much everything here.”
When No. 1 Florida kicks off the College 
World Series against No. 8 South Carolina on Saturday, the returning Gators will have revenge on their minds and a target on their backs.
O’Sullivan is confident the freshmen can 
keep up in an unfamiliar environment.
“It’s one thing to be the underdog and not 
have expectations, but it’s another thing when there are expectations,” O’Sullivan said. “The relief of just getting [the MLB Draft] over with and getting to Omaha, I’m looking forward to just watching this team play.”

 MIAMI — Several weeks before 
this season even started, LeBron 
James and Kevin Durant were com-peting against each other.
  Hell Week, they called it, a four-
day series of grueling workouts.
  Starting Tuesday , they’ll meet 
again. They’ll call that the NBA ﬁ  -
nals.
  Neither was playing at the level 
they are now when James invited 
Durant to work out with him during the NBA lockout in his hometown of Akron, Ohio.
Now as James tries to win his 
ﬁ  rst ring, ﬁ  ttingly, it’s Durant in his way.
  “It’s only right. It’s only right,” 
James said. “We look forward to the challenge. It’s going to be a big test for us.”
  James played at a rarely seen lev-
el in the Eastern Conference ﬁ  nals 
against the Boston Celtics.
According to STATS LLC, James 
became the ﬁ  rst player since Sha-
quille O’Neal in the 2000 ﬁ  nals to have six 30-point games in a play-off series. In the one contest where James didn’t score 30, he ﬁ  nished with 29 in Game 4, fouling out in overtime.
  His series averages against the 
Celtics: 33.6 points and 11 rebounds per game on 53 percent shooting. He had ﬁ  ve games with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds in the entire regular season — then did it ﬁ  ve times in the series against Boston alone.
  “He was absolutely brilliant this 
series, and we all know it,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.
“He’s playing at an historic level during the playoffs, driving us with his will. We do not take his talent or his will or his competitiveness for granted. And we need every single bit of it. He is pushing himself be-yond his limits, and he’s pushing the rest of the team as well.”
  Said Heat guard Dwyane Wade: 
“He’s amazing.”
  There were many moments for 
the Heat to celebrate on Saturday night, when they punched their tick-et back to the NBA ﬁ  nals by ousting Boston 101-88 in Game 7.
  Heat owner Micky Arison 
couldn’t have gotten his hands off the East trophy fast enough, since 
that isn’t the one he wants anyway. 
James felt the same way . The Heat star left the ﬂ  oor in a cap and T-shirt, one arm raised in joy.
  Behind him, the celebration 
continued. By then, he was already thinking about what’s next.
  “I really thought he in particu-
lar played a very smart, aggressive 
game,” Celtics coach Doc Rivers 
said.
“He kind of let the game come 
to him, and then down the stretch he took the game over. That’s what great players do.”
  They don’t do it alone, though.  Criticized last season for defer-
ring too often in crucial situations, 
James went into the offseason driv-
en by the pain of failing in the NBA ﬁ  nals. And even during the lockout, he did anything he could to improve — two-a-day workouts, studying with Hakeem Olajuwon, yoga, box-ing, beach sprints, even asking Du-rant to come to Akron for a few days for some training.
  In those sessions, they pushed 
each other to the limit.  “Me and KD, man, just tryin’ to 
get better,” James said in a video of one workout posted online.
  And look at them now, two su-
perstars set to ﬁ  ght for one ring.
  “I envisioned it every day we 
worked out,” James said. “I under-stood what his passion was. I under-stood what his drive was.”
  They both understood the other 
perfectly.
  James and the Heat lost to Dallas 
in last season’s ﬁ  nals. Durant and the Thunder lost to Dallas in last season’s Western Conference ﬁ  nals. This probably couldn’t have been scripted any better. Maybe the two best players in the world, scarred by similar disappointment, trying to make the other better.
  And when the ﬁ  nal series of 
the season begins Tuesday night in Oklahoma City , they’ll each have a close-up view of how far the other has come.
  “It’s going to be a battle,” Durant 
said.
  The Heat and Thunder split 
two games during the regular sea-son, both winning at home. Durant 
scored the most points in the NBA 
this season at 1,850, James was sec-ond with 1,683.
James won the MVP award, 
Durant ﬁ  nished second in that bal-loting. And in these ﬁ  nals, one will ﬁ  nish ﬁ  rst again, the other will ﬁ  nish second again.
  “It’s not about Kevin and LeB-
ron,” Thunder coach Scott Brooks said.
“It’s not about any other thing 
other than playing good basketball against a very good team. ... Indi-vidually, they’re the best players in the league.”   TUESDAY, JUNE 12, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

THE RALLY
 Corey: For those of you looking for a 
competitive NBA ﬁ  nals, don’t get your 
hopes up. The real ﬁ  nals ended when the 
Thunder took four straight games to upset the Spurs.  Now begins the encore: like when you sit through a Dexys Midnight Runners concert. 
When they hit the stage at the end to play one 
last song, there is only one possible outcome.
After witnessing Scotty Brooks out-coach 
the great Gregg Popovich, Erik Spoelstra might as well step down and escape with 
what little conﬁ  dence (and resume) he has 
left. Opening as a 4.5-point favorite, the 
Thunder will take Game 1 from a worn-
down Heat squad in the Sooner State.
Sure, the Heat might ﬁ  nd a way to ﬁ  ght back, 
maybe connect with a few slaps here and 
there. The Pacquiao-Bradley judges might 
even claim the Heat were the better team.  But 
with an 8-0 record at home this postseason, 
the Thunder will ultimately end this series in six games.
  Joe: Oh, Corey . Did you even watch the 
Eastern Conference Finals? It may have been 
a rough, ugly , seven-game crap fest, but it 
produced a real champion: the Heat. Grant-
ed, Miami looked far from great. They were 
inconsistent and, at times, overmatched by the Celtics. But then, much to the dismay of 
throngs of haters, the dominant version of the 
Heat made an unwelcome return to the spot-
light only rivaled by the release of the utterly 
useless third installment of the Men in Black 
franchise. Down 3-2 and sitting on the brink of elimination, LeBron James roared back to life and dominated. King 
James scored 76 
points and grabbed 
27 rebounds in the 
ﬁ  nal two games of the series to send 
Boston packing.  In 
the words of Dwight 
Schrute from NBC’s 
The Ofﬁ  ce, “The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand 
you want on the wheel.” With LeBron sitting 
pretty in the driver’s seat, Miami is cruising 
towards a championship.
  Corey: You could have Jimmie John-
son in the driver’s seat for all I care; in the 
end you still have a Pontiac Fiero.  Sure 
it looks ﬂ  ashy , but put it in a race and 
you’re no better than Danica Patrick.
Just look at the Thunder’s supporting cast: 
Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins and Thabo Sefolosha. With two proliﬁ  c shot block-
ers down low, and a defensive special-
ist roaming the perimeter, LeBron will 
have a better chance of getting in and out 
of Cleveland alive than attacking the rim.
Say what you will about the Thunder’s de-
fense, but what they did to the Spurs after Game 2 was nothing short of impressive.  And 
with an offense averaging 102.3 points per 
game with a 51.2 adjusted ﬁ  eld goal percent-
age, defense might as well be optional.
  Joe: Looks ﬂ  ashy? C’mon, Corey . LeBron 
James was named the NBA MVP this season. 
He’s the best automobile on the market. And as much as Chicky-
Chicky-Bron-Bron 
tried to prove he’s 
a one-man show in 
the last two games of the Eastern Confer-
ence Finals, he’s only 
one part of “The Big 
Three.” Even though 
he dresses like a Ken doll, Dwyane Wade is a 
top-ﬁ  ve player in the league, and Chris Bosh 
— the only known dinosaur still roaming the 
earth — is a perennial All Star. These three 
guys are not a joke. D-Wade is known for his 
ability to create — and convert — tough shots. 
The Thunder may boast a powerful paint trio, 
but it’s nothing Wade hasn’t seen before. In 
fact, Wade averaged 20.5 points per game 
against Oklahoma City in two meetings this 
season.  As far as Bosh is concerned, he can 
form an adequate duo with Udonis Haslem down low. The Heat may not overpower the 
Thunder in the post, but they’ll keep it close.
Corey: Udonis Haslem would make a bet-
ter duo with Art Garfunkel (sorry , Florida 
fans).  That 6-foot-8 liability will give either 
Perkins or Ibaka the chance to sit in the lane 
and cut off the Heat’s bread-and-butter: driv-ing the lane.  This season, the Thunder led the 
league with 8.17 blocks per game, almost two 
blocks more than the second-place Wizards.
And you’re forgetting that one dreaded quar-
ter — the one that comes after “The First 
Three.”  The Heat are notorious for struggling 
in the fourth, and the Thunder seem to have found their stroke this postseason, putting up 
29.3 points in their last four games with an 83.5 
free throw percentage. Meanwhile, Miami has 
not fared as well at the charity stripe this post-
season with a 72.3 percent clip. It goes with-out saying that adjusting to the trio of scoring 
champ Kevin Durant, sixth-man-of-the-year 
James Harden and All-Star Russell Westbrook 
is like predicting who will be gone from the 
Heat next year: Bosh or Spoelstra.
  Joe: Funny you should mention blocks 
considering the Heat lead the NBA with the fewest opponent blocks per game  in the 
playoffs (3.5).  If anything, Miami will drive 
the lane with fervor against Oklahoma City . 
When it comes down to it, LeBron is better 
man-to-man than anybody in the NBA. Also, 
as I mentioned before, that Wade guy is pret-
ty good at getting to the basket and making 
things happen. The Heat will get to the free-
throw line early and often against the Thun-der. Granted, Miami averaged roughly three 
fewer free-throw attempts against Oklahoma 
City than against other foes this season. How-
ever, the Heat’s 93 percent rate from the char-
ity stripe against the Thunder, which was 15.5 
percent higher than their regular season clip, 
should compensate for the slightly lower free throw count. In this high-powered battle be-
tween two abstract, natural elements, James 
and Wade will play like freaks of nature. The 
Thunder can’t take the Heat, so they better 
stay out of the kitchen.

twitter: @mccall_coreyyoung men,” coach Mike Hol-
loway said. “We had a lot of adversity, not just this week, 
but throughout the year. You 
think about things, the people that weren’t here, the people that didn’t want to give you 
a chance, but our guys never bought into it. I’m extremely 
proud of them.”
The adversity for Florida’s 
outdoor season started at the 
NCAA Indoor Championships. 
Horn entered the second day of heptathlon competition in first place and was two events 
away from securing a win, 
when the senior got injured during pole-vault warm ups. Horn sat out a majority of 
the outdoor season due to the injury. After he was suspend-ed for the SEC Outdoor Cham-
pionships, Horn did not have 
a decathlon score to qualify him for the NCAA East Pre-liminary Round and therefore 
wasn’t able to qualify for the 
championships.
Demps came next. After 
the five-time NCAA Cham-pion finished second in the 
first round at the NCAA East Preliminary Round, all he had 
to do was finish in the top 12 during the finals to advance to the championships. However, Demps was forced to pull out 
of the competition because of 
a tweaked hamstring.
After winning the title in 
the men’s 4x100 twice in the 
last three years, the hopes 
were high for the Gators to take home another one. Unfor -
tunately for Florida, the relay team dropped the baton dur -
ing a hand off at the NCAA East Preliminary Round, caus-ing them to miss out on quali-
fying for nationals.
“We lost our best sprinter, 
we lost our best decathlete and 
our 4x100 didn’t qualify,” Hol-
loway said. “A lot of people 
would have given up hope, but our group of guys didn’t. I sat them down after region-
als and I said, ‘We  are still the 
best team in the country, as long as you believe it,’ and our guys believed it.”
Despite losing out on 
those three events, the Gators still came out on top. Florida scored in seven events in com-parison to LSU scoring nine times. However, they still out-scored the runner-up Tigers to earn them their second NCAA 
title this year.
Out of those seven events, 
Florida took first place in three 
 — Tony McQuay (400 meters), 
Omar Craddock (triple jump) 
and Dedric Dukes, Hugh Gra-ham, Jr., Leonardo Seymore and McQuay (4x400 meter re-lay). 
McQuay’s performance 
in the 400 meters set a new personal record for him with a time of 44.58. His win also 
gave the Gators their first title 
in the event in school history. 
In addition to the 400 me-
ters title, Florida also won its first 4x400 meter relay title. 
The four now hold the world 
leading time with a mark of 3:00.02.
Craddock earned his win 
with an all-conditions best of 16.92 meters, giving the Gators its sixth straight NCAA title in the triple jump.
The Gators also had two 
top-three finishes. Junior Jer -
emy Postin was runner-up in the hammer throw, and junior Dwight Barbiasz finished third 
in the high jump. Combined, 
the two earned 14 points for Florida.
As the Gators look forward 
to earning their third straight 
NCAA title next year, the 
men’s team will lose Demps and Horn.
“I actually figured out on 
the plane that we had no se-niors (competing on the men’s side),” Holloway said. “Ob-viously, if we stay healthy, there is a bright future for the 
University of Florida, on both 
the men’s and the women’s sides.”
