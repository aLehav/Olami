For the ﬁ  rst time in UF Student 
Government history, all 50 Student 
Senate seats were awarded to one party. That party is Swamp. 
Swamp Party presidential candi-
date Cory Yeffet and vice-presiden-tial candidate Vivan Nguyen won the Spring 2014 election with about 93 percent of the vote.
Yeffet and Nguyen, the only 
presidential and vice-presidential candidates on the executive ticket, won with 7,012 votes.
Elliot Grasso, Swamp Party’s 
Student Body treasurer candidate, won his race with about 82 percent of the vote, beating Taco Libre Party candidate Micaela Montero Dokser by 5,074 votes.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, 
7,919 students cast their votes in the Student Government elections. Last Spring’s election had about 
10,048 votes, according to Alligator 
archives. 
Yeffet said that winning the elec-
tion was “incredible.” 
“The students spoke, and I’m 
glad that we’re going to be able to deliver what they want,” he said. 
Nguyen said she was in disbelief 
when she heard the results. “It hasn’t hit me yet,” she said. 
“This was one of the best tickets we 
ever put on.”
Grasso said he was “beyond ex-
cited” about the results. 
“I’m honored that the students 
would entrust me with this immense 
responsibility,” he said. 
Supervisor of Elections Justin 
Hoover announced the winners at 10:30 p.m. and said there were no 
technical difﬁ  culties during the vot-
ing process.
Despite having no executive 
candidates up for election, Students Party ofﬁ  cially boycotted attending the election results announcement Wednesday night.
Olga Rodriguez, Students Party 
president, said she hopes the boy-
cott will show students how corrupt 
SG is.
“We wanted the opportunity to 
get students a little more aware of the injustice that’s been going on in this election and in the Student Gov-ernment as a whole,” she said.
In addition to voting for the ex-
ecutive candidates, students also 
voted for Student Senate candidates. 
Each candidate represented either a college or a classiﬁ  cation.
Swamp Party won all 50 Sen-
ate seats. Kamal Bharti, a write-in Swamp candidate, won one of the 10 graduate Senate seats.
The Students Party and Taco 
Libre Party candidates did not win any Senate seats. 
In total, Swamp Party nominated  
49 candidates, Students Party nomi-nated 16 candidates, and Taco Li-bre Party nominated 33 candidates to appear on the ballot for Senate seats.
Additionally, two referendum 
questions and a constitutional amendment were listed on the bal-lot.
One referendum asked students 
if UF should implement an open-container policy on home football gamedays for those legally able to drink. The other question gauged student opinion on adding a 50-cent-per-credit-hour fee that would be used to fund energy efﬁ  ciency and 
renewable energy projects on cam-

Bambooville creator Jon Anderson 
met with representatives from UF’s 
physical plant Wednesday to discuss the future of the art installation, which is slated to be torn down.
Anderson and the representatives 
sat on green metal patio furniture in the remnants of Bambooville surrounded by the dozen students who came out to sup-port Anderson.
Jeff Chorlog, the assistant vice presi-
dent of the Physical Plant Division, said he was there to reiterate that Bamboov-ille must be removed from UF’s prop-erty by Monday.
Anderson and his student helper, 
23-year-old UF management graduate student Elliot Larkin, asked to extend 
the deadline to March 10, but Chorlog 
encouraged Anderson to create a pro-posal and submit it to UF ofﬁ  cials.
“You need to deconstruct it, store it 
and go through the proper channels,” Chorlog said.
Bambooville has been almost entirely 
dismantled, as per the university’s re-quest. 
In the days following the news, two 
petitions were created asking UF to con-sider keeping the art installation. As of press time, the petitions had about 1,500 signatures combined.Locals ﬁ  ght for Bambooville

University Police ﬁ  led a sworn complaint 
charging a student with disorderly conduct af-
ter he confronted a belligerent street preacher Wednesday afternoon on Turlington Plaza.
The student, 26-year-old Adam Isler, con-
fronted the preacher, 48-year-old John Kranert, at about 3:40 p.m., said UPD Lt. Kristy Sasser. During the ﬁ  ght, Isler tried to take a sign Kra-nert was holding, then fell to the ground. When he got back up, he slapped Kranert in the face.
Kranert declined to press charges, Sasser 
said. If he had, Isler would’ve been charged with battery as well. 
Earlier in the day, UPD received two noise complaints about Kranert from Isler and an-other student because Kranert was yelling into a megaphone, Sasser said.
Madison Cherry, a 19-year-old UF sociology 
and political science sophomore, was selling doughnuts on the plaza with student organiza-tion Nourish International at about the time the ﬁ  rst noise complaint came in. 
Cherry said Kranert was calling students 
names through the megaphone as they walked by, like “whore” and “pervert.” He also kept pointing at and giving a thumbs down to Cher-ry’s group, which was selling the doughnuts to 
raise money for orphans in Uganda. 
Eventually, a police ofﬁ  cer showed up and 
told him he couldn’t have his megaphone, 
which angered him, she said.
“He would get really upset that we were 
louder than him,” she said.Student reprimanded after

Next time you get arrested, don’t forget to 
pose and smile. Your mugshot could end up 
in a new kind of beauty pageant. 
The first-ever Miss Mugshot Pageant, pre-
sented by the Campus Mugshots website, is 
allowing the public to anonymously vote in a 
poll for the most attractive mugshots of wom-en arrested last month at UF, Florida State University and the University of Georgia.
Scott Lawrence, the Gainesville representa-
tive for Campus Mugshots, said the website decided to start this pageant because fans asked for it.
“People wanted it, so we put it out there,” 
Lawrence said.
The premise of Campus Mugshots is to al-
low the community to have a free and easier access to find criminal records of fellow class-mates or future roommates, he said. 
Lawrence said none of the women featured 
in the January pageant have contacted them asking to be removed.
“Most of these people are smiling (in their 
mug shots),” he said. “I don’t know if they’re 
worried about it, honestly.”
Lawrence said he had no comment or opin-ion as to how he would feel if he were some-
one featured in the poll.
According to the Campus Mugshots web-
site, January Miss Mugshot UF has received a total of about 660 votes. Among the three schools, more than 2,250 votes had been cast as of Tuesday night.
The site will continue the pageant on a 
monthly basis based on response from the public, Lawrence said. They may hold a male pageant at some point as well. 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokes-
man Art Forgey said although the sheriff’s of-fice does not agree with the idea, the mug shot pageant is legal.
“There is some work to be done on public 
records law that allows companies to get that information and repost it,” Forgey said. “Until that’s done, our hands are tied as to what we can do with it.”
Jessica Diepholz, a 20-year-old UF biology 
junior, said she doesn’t agree with the pageant and would be upset if she were one of the fea-tured girls.
“I feel like (Campus Mugshots) is not really 
realizing that a mugshot is probably (taken) at that person’s worst moment in their life,” Diepholz said. Campus Mugshots rolls out online ‘mugshot pageant’ poll

This weekend, more UF 
students will have the chance 
to say goodbye to their fears of heights and reach for the sky.
Lake Wauburg’s South Shore 
will host Gator Open Climb, a free opportunity to climb on the new High Ropes and Elements Challenge Course as well as the Alpine Tower, said Hayden Manuel, department of recre-ational sports assistant.
Saturday will be the open 
climb for the new challenge 
course, and  Sunday the Al-
pine Tower will be open climb. Both obstacles will be available between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. for UF students with a valid Gator 1 Card.
The events are normally 
only open to groups of 12 or 
more for team-building activi-
ties, but this weekend, students will have a chance to check it out without a group.
 “Once they go out on the 
course, they’re going to want to take their student organizations out,” Manuel said.
Alexsandra Bello, a 19-year-
old UF mathematics sopho-more, said she tries to go to the South Shore every month to rock climb. She said she thinks students should check out Wauburg’s high-adrenaline of-ferings.
“I definitely think it’s an 
advantage of UF,” she said.

Through the help of a grant, a national business career and 
leadership program is suiting up its UF team to empower 
women.
In November, UF Enactus won the Uncap Opportunities 
for Women Project Partnership, a $1,500 grant sponsored by 
the Coca-Cola Foundation. This semester, the group is using 
the funds to partner with the Displaced Homemaker Program, which is supported by Santa Fe College.
The program is a local branch of a nationwide organization 
that helps women develop business, financial and life-manage-ment skills.The program builds on women’s strengths to help them fine 
tune and promote skills they already have, said Karen Sheets, an instructor with the Displaced Homemaker Program.
“We don’t negate anything,” she said. “We recognize who 
they are and the abilities that these women have.”
So far, Enactus has used the grant to help eight women in 
need create business plans and develop computer literacy.
Program coordinator JoAnn Wilkes said the tools supplied by Enactus have helped increase awareness about the program.With a staff of only three women that heavily relies on com-munity volunteers, getting the word out about the program is tough, she said.
It has helped build confidence in women like Darla Perry 
who sought support after seeing an ad in the paper. 
Being able to share struggles with others served as a sup-
port system by encouraging group communication.  After Per-ry graduated from the program, Enactus stepped in to help cre-ate and market her business, Darla Michelle Specialty Cakes, possible, Perry said. 
“They’re helping me to continue my education to improve 
my skills,” she said. “They’ve just pointed me in the right direc-
tion.”UF Enactus uses grant to empower women in business roles

Most voters said ‘yes’ to open-container referendum question
pus.
About 90 percent of the people who vot-
ed on the open-container referendum voted 
“yes,” and about 65 percent of the people who voted on the green referendum question voted 
“yes.” About 720 people opposed the open-
container referendum, and about 2,180 people opposed the green referendum.
The constitutional amendment on the bal-
lot that posed the question of updating the SG anti-discrimination policy to include genetic 
information received 4,516 “yes” votes. About 
13 percent opposed it.
Micaela Montero Dokser, Taco Libre’s can-
didate for treasurer, said for having a single platform and no promotion besides social me-dia, landing 16 percent of the vote was pretty amazing.
“I think we ran a taco-tastic campaign,” 
Montero Dokser said. “There’s nothing I would’ve changed.”
She said Taco Libre Party’s future is unde-
termined, but the party’s mission will carry on. The group is still considering speaking 
to Aramark, the company that provides UF’s 
food services, or even proposing a Student Senate bill.
“Sure, campaigns are about who gets elect-
ed,” she said. “But at the end of the day, it’s all about the mission.” ElECtionS , from page 1Yolandy Michel / Alligator

A campus museum’s ﬁ  rst writ-
ing competition, “Words on Can-vas,” invites UF’s wordsmiths to 
show off their art-inﬂ  uenced prose and poetry.
Undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents are invited to submit creative writing or poems inspired by 10 
pieces of art currently in the Samuel 
P. Harn Museum of Art. The dead-line for submissions is March 15. “We’re just basically looking for 
creative writing inspired by the art ... sort of organic and enjoyable,” said Colin Williams, a UF creative writing graduate student and intern at the Harn.
A total of eight winners will 
be announced April 5 during the Harn’s “Written Inspiration” liter-ary event. Winners will be awarded about $30 worth of museum mer-chandise, which is subject to change.The winning written pieces will be published in a book in the museum and on its website to complement 
the art pieces the works were in-
spired by.
“What really matters is that the work clearly reﬂ  ects the art that it’s based on,” he said. 
Benson Joseph, a 22-year-old UF 
biology senior, said the competition could encourage poetry on campus again, following the closing of the 
Reitz Union’s Orange and Brew.
“It could deﬁ  nitely be a start for 
bringing things back,” he said.

place for free —not 
hate — speech
If you’re on Facebook, you probably saw bemused, frantic, 
outraged statuses about the Turlington preacher and a UF student getting into a tussle. 
The Turlington preacher — or any campus preacher — is an 
inevitable part of the college experience. In a perfect world, these 
preachers would be respectful, say their peace and be open to 
thoughtful discussion of religion and spirituality. 
Unfortunately, such is not always the case. Talk to anyone 
who has crossed the Turlington preacher’s path, and he or she will tell you about the name-calling and harassment on the basis of sexuality, religion or clothing choice. 
Aside from the obvious — that harassing students is hardly 
a Christlike tactic for getting people interested in Christianity — the Turlington preacher’s words undeniably fall under the 
category of hate speech. 
Hate speech presents a moral dilemma for champions of 
civil rights. According to the American Bar Association, “In 
this country there is no right to speak ﬁ  ghting words — those words without social value, directed to a speciﬁ  c individual, that would provoke a reasonable member of the group about whom the words are spoken. 
“For example, a person cannot utter a racial or ethnic epithet 
to another if those words are likely to cause the listener to react 
violently. However, under the First Amendment, individuals 
do have a right to speech that the listener disagrees with and to speech that is offensive and hateful.”
In regards to the great free-speech-during-hate-speech de-
bate, the American Bar Association suggests that policies should be created to deﬁ  ne hate speech as a hate crime, and therefore punishable. In doing so, laws and policies would discourage bad behavior — not bad beliefs. 
On our open campus, speakers shouldn’t be prohibited from 
publicly delivering a message. However, singling out students and harassing them should be deﬁ  ned as an act of hate and should have a consequence, whether it be a citation or an ejec-tion from campus. 
According to the UF Student Conduct Code, “As an educa-
tional institution, the University recognizes that the transmis-sion of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, and the development of individuals require the free exchange of ideas on any subject whether or not controversial, self-expression, and the challeng-
ing of beliefs and customs.
“This often (although not always) requires respectful speech 
and conduct ... the University requires civility, respect, and in-
tegrity in the curricular program and encourages these behav-iors in other activities among all members of the student com-munity.”
UF has the ability to discourage the Turlington preacher from 
singling out students and insulting them.
This incident should send a message to the university that 
action is required to make students of every religion, ethnicity, race, sexuality and gender feel safe.

Nine years ago, a 10-year plan to end homelessness began in Gainesville. It only takes a walk past Bo Diddley Community Plaza downtown to see how 
well that went.
To be fair, homelessness is not an easy issue to tackle. 
But Gainesville is a small town with a big problem. The city had the second largest growth in its homeless popula-tion among smaller cities, according to a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
After 10 years, there might be a solution — but don’t get 
your hopes up. 
Late last year, the city purchased the former Gainesville 
Correctional Facility to turn it into what they envision as a one-stop center for the homeless — a place for society’s most neglected to get food, shelter and access to other ser-vices that can help them empower themselves. It’s being run by the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry, a local nonproﬁ  t.
Homelessness is a multipronged issue. It can stem from 
anything from economic hardship to mental illness. This new center for the homeless — it has yet to be named — would address different aspects of the issue to help reduce it overall. 
In theory, this is a fantastic idea. It helps get at the root 
of homelessness by offering services beyond a bed to sleep in. Ideally, it is a temporary stop to help people get on their feet and off the street. 
Unfortunately, even this solution leaves a lot to be de-
sired. 
For one, the goal isn’t to end homelessness, despite that 
10-year plan. According to WUFT, the executive director of ACCHH said the ultimate goal is to relocate the homeless from their usual residence of Bo Diddley Plaza.
Hiding homelessness has become all the rage. Cities 
across the nation accomplish this by criminalizing the act of being homeless, throwing people in jail for being with-out a home. Other times, feeding the homeless is criminal-ized. Take the case of the Rev. Hugh Hollowell in Raleigh, N.C. He and a group of volunteers set up near a park with breakfast sandwiches and coffee only to be told by the police that if he served anyone, he would be arrested. Apparently a permit is required to serve food in the park, which 
costs $800 per day. 
Gainesville hasn’t gone that far. Instead, it will force the 
homeless almost four miles away from the town square, more than an hour-long walk. City ofﬁ  cials counter that there are two bus routes that go to the center, which is near Gainesville Regional Airport. They don’t answer how the homeless are expected to pay the fare, however. 
Even if ending homelessness was the plan, this new 
shelter doesn’t go far enough to accomplish it. Only four buildings will beneﬁ  t the homeless, despite having much more space on the property. Other buildings will house different programs that will be chosen by the community.
Another issue is that the center will only be able to 
house 100 people: 50 men and 50 women. That is far short of the 2,094 homeless people counted by the ACCHH in 2012 (acchh.org/infoabout.shtml), the latest count avail-able. A decade after a 10-year plan to end homelessness was implemented means it should be nearly gone. Instead, this multimillion-dollar project will reduce it by less than one-tenth of 1 percent. 
The City of Gainesville has done little to eliminate 
homelessness at the end of its 10-year plan. This new, one-stop center for the homeless is a start, but if it is going to make a difference, it must be made more accessible to more people. For now, the only hope is that this center will make a difference for the few who are able to utilize it.

Even though New York Fashion 
Week officially ended Feb. 13, the 
debut of the fall collections is only the very beginning of a new sea-son of popular colors, patterns and trends Gainesville can look forward to.
 This season’s NYFW that de-
buted designers’ fall/winter 2014 to 2015 collections was even more dra-matic than usual. Most shows were punctuated with a forecast of bitter cold or snow, leaving a citywide, 
stiletto-unfriendly trail of slush lead-
ing to most runway venues.
 Despite the inclement weath-
er, popular designers such as Zac Posen, Reem Acra and Marc Jacobs were able to deliver standout collec-tions that provided insight into the popular trends for the upcoming months, as well as a few speculative 
Oscar gowns.
 Fur was a major staple at New 
York Fashion Week and at the more 
recent London Fashion Week, which ended Tuesday.  With big names Jen-ny Packham and Topshop Unique showing over-the-top fur statement coats, and Vivienne Tam accent-ing many looks with luxurious fur 
scarves — all signs point to fur being 
a big part of most wardrobe trends for the colder months.
 Despite the muted palette of the 
season, both New York and London Fashion Week did not disappoint when it comes to color and pattern. Mara Hoffman, known primarily for her swimwear, showed a collec-
tion that made tribal patterns seem 
plausible for fall, with head-to-toe patterns making a statement on the runway.
 Across the pond, Peter Pilotto, a 
designer who recently collaborated with Target, debuted a highly antici-pated collection of bold silhouettes that were highlighted with vibrant, 
saturated colors and graphic pat-
terns.
 Balancing between bright colors 
and more neutral, season-appro-priate hues and fabrics, the palette for this season’s fashion weeks had something for everyone. With every-thing from fur to graphic patterns on the runways, it’s safe to say that the 
coming fall and winter trends will 
land just about everywhere on the fashion map.

In 1999, American audiences 
sat glued to their television screens 
to watch President Josiah Bartlet, played by Martin Sheen, and his presidential Democratic administra-
tion work its way through crisis and 
grapple with Congress.
Roughly seven years after the 
final “West Wing” episode aired, another Democrat has come into power.
But viewers are not given the 
ideal world of Bartlet and company, where decisions were made for the good of the American people.
Instead, the audience is treated 
to the vengeful world of Francis “Frank” Underwood on the Netflix original series “House of Cards,” where cameras follow a spurned congressman on his path to power.
“House of Cards,” which released 
its second season on Valentine’s Day, centers on Underwood, the House majority whip from South Carolina. Though the first episode of 
season one shows 
the congressman 
coldly suffocating an injured dog, it’s only after the president has de-cided to break a promise and give the position of secretary of state to a Colorado senator that the audience sees the full extent of Underwood’s political scheming.
Underwood, played by Oscar 
winner Kevin Spacey, spends the first season establishing Washing-ton, D.C., as his personal chess-
board. 
The show reveals the dark side 
of politics, the blackmailing and un-
derhanded conniving similar to that of the Grant presidency in ABC’s “Scandal.” However, it’s Under-wood’s breaking of the fourth wall, confiding his opinions of his col-leagues in the audience, that really makes the show one of the best po-litical dramas on “television.”
With the second season released, 
viewers can now binge-watch an-
other 13 episodes and see where Un-
derwood’s ambition takes him. 
Trailers hinted that Underwood’s 
underhanded dealings might be un-covered, but Frank Underwood is always two trademark knuckle taps ahead.

To bring the world’s 
youngest heavy metal band 
on stage as the headline act at some music festivals may seem strange, but not at Re-
store the Music Festival.
The event will be in down-
town Gainesville on Satur-
day from 1 p.m. to 1 a.m. to raise money for VH1’s Save the Music Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to keeping music education in public schools.
Tickets are $10 in advance 
and $15 the day of the event.
This event is for the chil-
dren, so having the heavy metal Heene Boyz headline is only fitting.
The Heene Boyz is made 
up of the three Heene broth-ers: 11-year-old Falcon, 
13-year-old Ryo and 14-year-
old Bradford.
Bradford Heene said the 
group started playing four years ago after being inspired by their mother’s guitar skills. Since then, they have performed at well-known events, including Daytona 
Bike Week and the Daytona 
500.
The Heene Boyz are pas-
sionate about keeping music in schools.
“We want to see other 
kids rocking out, too,” Brad-ford said.
The youngest brother, Fal-
con, said his ultimate goal for the band is to one day get to 
tour with Metallica.
Event manager Richard 
Heene, the boys’ father, said 
the event should inspire growth and changes within the Gainesville music scene.
Richard Heene said festi-
valgoers can look forward to seeing unsigned artists from 
all genres.
“People will get to experi-
ence music they never have 
before,” he said. “There needs to be a place for unsigned art-ists to get exposure.”
Sawyer Hudson, a 19-year-
old UF psychology sopho-more, said he hopes the festi-
val will do just that for him.
“It is a huge opportunity 
for me to get my music out 
to my fellow students at the University of Florida, as well as a fun chance to make many new friends in the unsigned music industry,” he wrote in an email.
He said Restore the Music 
Festival will be his biggest gig yet as a solo artist, as well as the debut performance of his band, Time of Calling.
He is also passionate 
about VH1’s Save the Music Foundation.
“I believe that every child 
has a right to have musical instruments available to him or her to be able to learn to play,” Hudson said. “Music is a wonderful, life-changing endeavor, and it’s meant to be shared.”Downtown music

“The Lego Movie” follows the story of Emmet, an 
average, rule-abiding Lego miniﬁ  gure mistaken as the key to saving the world.  Embarking on an epic quest to stop an evil tyrant, Emmet is, well, less than prepared. Sure, it might be a children’s movie or — let’s face it — an extended commercial, but “The Lego Movie” offers up adventure, romance and politics. See it:

BiancoDrawing on a smorgas-
bord of inspiration, Jon Ba-
tiste and Stay Human’s al-
bum “Social Music” is just 
that — social music.
Intended to be music 
people can connect to, “So-
cial Music” is a genre-bar 
hopping compilation of jazz, funk, classical and ragtime that is refreshing to listen to. 
Pianist Jonathan Batiste 
was raised in New Orleans, born into a long line of jazz musicians. 
He started playing music 
at a young age and eventu-ally went on to study at The Juilliard School, where he met the rest of Stay Human: Joe Saylor, Ibanda Ruhumbi-
ka and Eddie Barbash. 
The album feels very easy, 
like a 12-track improvised 
jam session. 
The effortless sound that 
Stay Human has created makes jazz extremely acces-sible, especially for an audi-ence not familiar with con-
temporary music.
Although the album is at 
its best when the focus is on the instrumentals rather than 
the vocals, “Let God Lead” blends the two, making it 
one of the best songs on the 
album.
Though “St. James Inﬁ  r-
mary” and “Star Spangled 
Banner” are arguably over-
done, Batiste manages to shell out a new take on the classics. 
“Social Music” goes be-
yond gloriﬁ  ed elevator mu-sic. It’s jazz that leaves a seri-ous impression.

man will be performing to-night at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at 7:30 p.m.Jon Batiste’s new album delivers

Broken Bells’ latest release “After the 
Disco” is, as the name implies, the perfect 
soundtrack to unwind from a late night of dancing. 
The opening song “Perfect World” paints 
the scenery of passing city lights on a high-way you have to take to get home when the party’s over. It ﬁ  ts right into the background of any driving-heavy video game.  
Although the atmospheric synthesizer 
sets a soothing tone, the repetitive beats, such as the ones in “Perfect World” and “After the Disco,” give listeners the option to keep the party going. 
The tone of the album is cohesive but 
misleading. The tracks that give you the in-centive to dance are accompanied by lyrics like “just another day into a useless night,” which explore complex themes like the sadness that comes with being let down by ideals of love. 
The songs on the album 
that move away from the ‘80s synth pop inﬂ  uences 
are reminiscent of the duo’s respective mu-sical backgrounds before Broken Bells. 
“Medicine,” one of the more acoustic-
based songs, could easily double as a hit on 
an album by The Shins.
In songs where the focus is on the melo-
dy, James Mercer pushes his vocal range to 
echo the high-pitched register, but not past the point where you’ll stop listening. 
Although the album has the means to 
inﬂ  uence a dance party — not quite reach-ing its full potential — it’s just as likely to be reduced to a dance party in your car.Broken Bells’ new album

Chuck Palahniuk said it best: “That’s the best revenge of all: happiness. Nothing drives 
people crazier than seeing someone having a good f***ing life.” Maybe you’re not 
happy without her at this specific moment, but you were happy before her, and you’ll be happy again. The old saying, “The best way to get over somebody is to get under another, ” doesn’t always work, other than the numbing effect, so maybe protect your 
little soldiers for a while and stay away from easy Midtown ass. You were in a committed 
relationship for a decent amount of time; now it’s time to focus on you. Be a man, bro. Rub some dirt on it. Chug some whiskey, and chase it with Natty Light. Make every day “max out day” and find that dusty Jenna Jameson movie your ex never knew you had. If you can’t love yourself, who the f*** will?Yesterday, a friend of mine said every strong relationship flourishes because both partners get at least one hall pass a year. I don’t know if I agree with 
this theory, though, because if you’re supposedly in love with your girlfriend, I doubt you’d even think about touching another girl. If you think you’d really be into a break, know that you’re not going to be the only one getting a hall 
pass, sweetie. If your relationship is dull enough for you to want to see other 
people, she’s probably wanted to hop on some other D that isn’t as boring as yours for months now. If you guys give each other a freebie, know that she has the potential to meet someone better than you. He, whoever “he” is, is going to be going to be tall, chiseled, charming and have a huge you-know-what. He won’t fart during her favorite television show. He won’t “accidentally forget” to go downtown on the one night a week he actually f**** her. He won’t drink milk straight from the carton. He’ll be everything she’s ever wanted, and he’ll be INSIDE OF HER. Think about it. Still sound appealing?BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

The clock read 9:13 p.m. when the second-ranked Gators  
basketball team finished off the Tigers on the hardwood. 
Cheers coming from Auburn’s implosion at the O’Connell Center drowned out the 2,740 fans that turned down the air 
conditioning for the brisk Gainesville night. 
Forty-seven minutes later, Casey Turgeon smacked a single 
up the middle to give Florida a one-run lead heading to the 
ninth inning. 
Richie Martin tied the game a pitch earlier, bringing in two 
runs after reaching on a misfielded ground ball by North Flori-da third baseman Trent Higginbothem. Freshman right-hander 
Shaun Anderson earned the save in his collegiate debut as No. 
23 Florida outlasted North Florida 8-7 on Tuesday at McKethan Stadium.
“It was awesome. I think that’s the difference with this year’s 
team and last year’s team,” Martin said. “We might’ve fell down and stayed down the whole game. This year’s team  — we fight back every time if we’re down four runs in the first or in the last inning. It doesn’t matter.”
Florida found itself in an early hole after freshman starter 
Dane Dunning didn’t last past the second after surrendering one run, a wild pitch and leaving with the bases loaded. North Florida cleared the bases on a double by Higginbothem off Aar-on Rhodes.
The Gators grabbed their first lead in the seventh while 
throngs of basketball fans walked along Stadium Road as Tay-lor Gushue, hitting right-handed, skied a sacrifice fly to deep left-center field to make the score 5-4.
It disappeared just as fast as it came. A wild pitch and a sin-
gle against closer Justin Shafer led to two North Florida runs in the eighth. An error by Martin on a potential inning-ending double play scored the final Ospreys’ run. 
Yet, the Gators withstood the onslaught as they had all game. 
Freshman left-hander Kirby Snead pitched a scoreless eighth inning with a strikeout of North Florida’s No. 3 hitter Donnie LANDON WATNICK

With 21 seconds remaining 
and the game tied at 66, Florida 
faced the possibility of seeing its 17-game winning streak snap and losing its first home contest in 
nearly two years. 
Not if Patric Young had any-
thing to say about it. 
The senior center almost did not 
play in Wednesday night’s contest 
due to ailments in his knees, but his play down the stretch powered the No. 2 Gators (24-2, 13-0 South-eastern Conference) to a 71-66 win 
against the Tigers in the O’Connell 
Center.
Young posted a team-high 17 
points — all coming in the second half — but none were more impor-tant than the two he scored at the foul line late in the contest. 
After Auburn guard Chris 
Denson was fouled by forward 
Will Yeguete on a double team 
and missed the back end of his two free-throw attempts, Young pulled down the board and drew a foul from Tigers center Asauhn Dixon-Tatum.
With the crowd roaring, Young 
focused squarely on “striving to be great.” 
The late-game situation was a 
scenario he often simulates when shooting at the free-throw line during practice.
“I just went up there and 
swished them like it was nothing,” Young said.
“Endorphins kicked in or what-
ever it might be. I was very over-
whelmed. I was on Cloud 9, they 
would say.”
Following the senior’s key 
free throws to put UF ahead 68-66, Florida utilized its full-court press and forced AU forward Al-len Payne to turn over the ball on an errant inbound pass that sailed out of bounds.
Then, the Tigers (12-12, 4-9 SEC) intentionally fouled Scot-tie Wilbekin, and the senior point guard sunk his two shots from the charity stripe to lift the Gators to a four-point advantage.After KT Harrell missed a 
three-point attempt from the left wing with six seconds left, Florida

When Taylore Fuller hits the ball, it leaves 
the park.
Through No. 1 Florida’s first 11 games of 
the season, the sophomore utility player had 
logged only two hits — but both were home runs. 
She continued that streak in Florida’s 
home opener against Jacksonville on Wednesday.
Leading off the bottom of the third in-
ning, Fuller hit a long ball over the center-field fence, opening up the scoring for No. 
1 Florida. After her home run, 
the Gators (12-0) never gave up their lead, 
winning 6-0 against 
the Dolphins (5-5) at Katie Seashole Pressly 
Stadium.
“I saw it was a line drive. I have trouble 
seeing at dark so I couldn’t really tell if it was 
over,” Fuller said. “But it felt good and I felt like I made good contact with the ball, so re-
gardless I was happy with how it resulted. Hitting for power was not characteristic 
of Fuller in her freshman campaign. In 2013, the Trenton native only hit four home runs 
in 113 at-bats.
Then, with one out in the sixth inning, 
Fuller came through again. 
With Kirsti Merrit on second and Aubree 
Munro on first, Fuller hit a single to right field in the sixth inning, bringing in her sec-ond RBI of the night and her seventh on the Ryan Jones / Alligator Staff

Dewees in a left-on-left matchup and 
a 4-6-3 double play.
Wednesday featured the typical 
Florida-North Florida midweek affair — filled with mound visits, prolonged 
innings and lead changes. The Gators 
now lead the all-time series 8-6, with eight of those matchups decided by two or fewer runs. Florida notched its third-straight victory heading into a weekend series at No. 16 Miami. 
“We’ve seen them for three years 
now. They’re really good,” Gators 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said of Mi-
ami’s starting pitching. “They’re arguably one of the better pitching staffs in the whole country, so we’ll have our hands full. I’m looking for-ward to it. From a coaching stand-point, you’re anxious to see how they’ll handle it.”Florida showed poise as it flirted 
with disaster all game with North Florida stranding 11 runners. The Gators bullpen, solid through four 
games, benefited from four double 
plays. Depth allowed O’Sullivan to trot out eight pitchers and 13 differ-ent position players. That he said is the biggest difference from a year ago.

Shamsid-Deen had a game-high 14 points at the break.
Conversely, UF shot only 34.5 percent in the game’s 
first 20 minutes.
“It boils down to they were playing harder than us in 
the first half,” Wilbekin said.
Out of the half, Florida responded with an 11-3 run to 
climb back into the game. With Young leading the way 
throughout the second half, the Gators kept it close and eventually pulled away to end the game on another 11-3 
run.  
Senior forward Casey Prather recorded 16 points and 
nine rebounds, while Wilbekin added 15 points. 
Despite receiving a scare after suffering a wrist injury 
early in the second half, sophomore guard Michael Frazier 
II returned to the game and finished with nine points on a 3-of-9 clip from behind the arc.
His biggest shot, a three from the right wing, put UF 
ahead 66-65 with 41 seconds left in regulation.
The Gators have now won a school-record 18 consec-
utive games, 30 straight home contests and six in a row 
against the Tigers. 
With No. 1 Syracuse falling to Boston College in over-
time 62-59 on Wednesday night, Florida could jump to No. 
1 if it earns a win at Ole Miss on Saturday and ‘Cuse falls to Duke on the road.
But despite the increased national attention his team 
has received during its gradual climb to the top of the col-lege basketball ranks, Donovan does not want UF to get complacent and buy into all the hoopla — especially after 
a win where he saw his team lack motivation and passion 
at times. 
“Being undefeated in the league, ranking, all that stuff, 
no question you’re going to get everybody’s best shot,” Donovan said. “But I like to look at it the other way. Are we going to give our best shot?
“And I don’t think today we did that.”season.
“I was telling myself I just needed to 
score the runner.” Fuller said. “Whether that 
was a deep pop fly or a little half-dinky hit 
to right field, whatever works. I just wanted 
to score that runner or at least move them over.”
UF saw maturity in its underclassmen 
at the plate, with six of the team’s eight hits 
coming from freshmen or sophomores.
“Some of our players have turned from 
freshman year to sophomore year and had 
some good offensive performances so far 
this year,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“Justine McLean as a freshman came in 
and really got some sparks going for us to-
day.” 
Walton was also pleased with his team’s 
defensive play. 
“To me the biggest play of the game is 
the being able to turn the double play,” the ninth-year coach said. 
“The two double plays when they’ve got runners in scoring position to end the threat and end the rally.” 
In the pitching circle, junior Lauren Hae-
ger earned her fourth win of the season. 
After allowing two first-inning hits, the 
Peoria, Ariz., native found her rhythm, giv-ing up only two additional hits while strik-ing out seven batters in her third complete game of the season.
Despite her performance, Haeger feels 
that she can improve.
“I don’t think it was my best,” she said. “I 
wasn’t hitting my spots well. I think I had a 
bit of luck on my side. I felt good but not the best that I could have been.”
But Haeger’s contributions came from 
more than just the mound. 
After McLean singled to shortstop and 
stole second base, Haeger hit a home run — 
her fifth of the season — to center field, ex-
tending the Gators’ lead to 4-0 in her second 
at-bat of the game.
“I worked a 3-2 count, so I knew they 
were either going to come at me or throw like way out,” Haeger said. “So I saw what I 
liked and swung hard.”THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida is out for redemption 
against Missouri. 
Last season, the Tigers eked out 
a 69-64 victory against the Gators in 
Columbia, Mo. 
At the time, Missouri was third in 
the nation in three-pointers made. 
Heading into the O’Connell Cen-
ter tonight, the Tigers are fourth in the NCAA, averaging 9.4 threes per contest — about 28 points per game. 
“Missouri’s played fantastic and 
beat a very talented Auburn team at Auburn,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. “They’re playing well; shooting 
the ball better than anybody in our league.”
Butler is wary that such a strong 
three-point effort could potentially throw a wrench into a game plan. 
“The thing that I’m concerned 
with is that it will put us in a mindset to shoot more threes,” she said. “That 
was what I felt like happened to Au-
burn in their last ballgame, in which (Missouri) was up 42-14. A team like Auburn doesn’t typically shoot a ton of threes. All of a sudden they got into that groove of shooting shots they don’t normally take.”
Auburn is 13th in the Southeast-
ern Conference in three-point shots made per game — averaging only 2.8 — and is dead last in the conference in three-point percentage, shooting 26 percent. 
Against Missouri, Florida went 3 
for 18 from beyond the arc. 
“I think it puts you in a mindset 
where you’ve got to be contesting, because they don’t just shoot a lot of them, they hit a lot of them,” Butler said of Missouri. “As a rebounding unit, it puts you in a different spot, too. You’re going to have a lot more longer rebounds.”
For sophomore January Miller, 
facing a team that gives up long re-
bounds is just what the doctor or-
dered. 
“That’s something I’ve been work-
ing on, just trying to read where the ball’s going,” Miller said. “More long rebounds makes it easier for you to get out in transition.”
“It gives more of a chance for our 
guards to go and rebound; puts less 
pressure on the post.”
Coming off a less than desirable performance against Georgia on 
Sunday, Miller is poised to redeem herself against Missouri. Against 
the Bulldogs, she scored ﬁ  ve points, 
turned the ball over three times and fouled out. 
A major aspect that Butler has 
preached since the recent losses to both Georgia and Arkansas has been better ball management.
“They imposed their defensive 
style on us in very different ways,” 
Butler said. “Arkansas pretty much 
sat in a zone and they had one player that really got out in the passing lanes and we never really adjusted to her. Georgia was a little more aggres-sive, a little bit more trying to make plays.” 
With tonight’s game being Flor-
ida’s penultimate home game this 
season, the Gators are still maintain-
ing a simple approach to the rest of their season. 
“Well, we’ve got to win,” Butler 
said. “You have to win each posses-sion; you’ve got to win each half. In our game, it’s kind of broken down into four-minute segments because of the media timeouts. So you’ve got to 
try to win each four-minute segment 
of every ballgame.” UF looks to avenge loss to Mizzou16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2014

The No. 1 Gators men’s swimming and diving team is sec-
ond on the leaderboard after picking up two gold medals, two 
school records and an SEC record performance for Florida’s relay squads on Day 1 of the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionships and three gold medals and another school record on 
Day 2.
The action started with a photo ﬁ  nish in the women’s 200-
yard medley relay that was decided by nearly one-third of a 
second between No. 1 Georgia and No. 8 Tennessee while No. 5 Florida was less than a second behind, earning the bronze.
In response, the men’s competition took to the theatrics 
also as the Gators out-touched No. 6 Georgia by 0.2 seconds due to a come-from-behind career perfor-
mance from senior Brad deBorde.
When the 14-time All-American 
sprinter and UF record holder in the 50-yard freestyle took off 
from the block, his team trailed by a third of a second and was in ﬁ  fth place.
DeBorde threw down a 18.52-second swim, half a second 
faster than the rest of the pool and 0.6 seconds faster than the school record he posted in last year’s 50-yard free at SECs. He earned Florida a gold in the ﬁ  rst swimming event of the cham-
pionships while registering an NCAA “A” cut and new school 
record, stopping the clock at 1:24.53. 
“I knew we were behind going into my leg, but I had faith in 
Marcin [Cieslak] to catch us up a little bit, and then I was going to give it my all,” deBorde said. “Thankfully, I made a really nice turn and had some really good breakouts, which I’ve been working on a lot. It worked out for us and I was happy for us to come out on top.”
Setting records is rare — unless you’re deBorde.
His success on Day 1 was just foreshadowing for what 
would ensue. DeBorde broke his 50-yard free record in prelims, 
swimming the race in 19.05 seconds. With the top seed in the ﬁ  nals, he delivered an 18.88-second, gold-medal performance that avenged the dual-meet loss he suffered to rival Auburn swimmer Marcelo Chierighini — the 2013 SEC Champion in the 50-yard free. 
The Gators’ reigning 2013 national champion 800-yard free-
relay team left the competitors eating their bubbles. 
Florida went 6:13.03, more than four seconds faster than 
second-place Auburn, setting a school record and SEC record en route to the second gold for the Gators on Day 1.
“We were defending our championship and it is a really big 
race for our program. We are focusing on one event at a time,” Cieslak said. “We’ll try and make as many ﬁ  nals as we can, and then try and win the ﬁ  nals at night.” 
It was a good outing for the Gators women’s team, picking 
up bronze medals in the ﬁ  rst two swimming events while the 
rival Bulldogs won both relays. It was a pair of season bests for 
Florida.
But it continued struggling to break though the tough surge 
that Georgia amassed on Day 2. The Bulldogs have won every event through two days of competition and sit in ﬁ  rst place. Florida trails by more than 150 points in second place.
Diving hasn’t been the Gators strength this season, but soph-
omore Kahlia Warner delivered a career-best performance on the three-meter springboard, scoring 293.25 points in the ﬁ  nals 
and earning her eighth place.
“Really good start to this evening’s meet,” Gators coach 
Gregg Troy said. “Marcin Cieslak and Brad deBorde kind of set 
the tone …They just refused to lose.”Gators in second at
