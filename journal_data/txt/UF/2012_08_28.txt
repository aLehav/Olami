TAMPA, Fla. — With the 
threat of Tropical Storm Isaac 
approaching Tampa, UF student 
activists shrugged and threw on 
some ponchos.
About 1,000 people attended a 
rally and march Monday hosted 
by the Coalition to March on the 
RNC. Although Isaac shrunk the crowd size from the expected 5,000 people, about 200 UF stu-dents and Gainesville residents 
made their way to Florida’s west 
coast for the protest.
There were some concerns that 
bad weather would delay or can-
cel the protest, but student orga-nizers said that wasn’t an option.The march had a one-day permit to operate, and organizers said the march would happen rain or shine.
“Failure was never an option 
for us,” said Fernando Figueroa, 
22-year-old UF alumnus and a march organizer.
UF students and alumni dotted 
Perry Harvey Sr. Park in the heart 
of downtown Tampa as drizzling rain peppered the crowd. 
People rushed from tent to 
tent, hammering out logistics, and others stood among the chanting protesters.
As the rain cleared, students 
stood arm-in-arm at the front of the march. A small gaggle of report-
ers and photographers weaved 
through the crowd, interview-
ing protesters and focusing in on those who came decked out in 
costumes ranging from a yellow submarine to vaginas.
Dozens of ofﬁ  cers on foot 
and bicycles lined the pathway, sectioning off wrong turns with bikes and metal barriers to keep 
marchers together.
The group marched from 
the park toward the Tampa Bay 
Times Forum, spreading across the four-lane street in a group 
just large enough to ﬁ  ll the space 
of a typical intersection.
Some were from UF’s Students 
for a Democratic Society, which 
held protests last school year 
about issues including tuition and Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s leg-islative decisions.
Others were part of The 
Gainesville Interfaith Alliance for Immigrant Justice, which of-ten protests companies that have

Following a shooting that left a Santa 
Fe College student dead, Gainesville Po-
lice arrested two men connected to the 
murder.
Police charged Adrick Montez Wil-
liams, 28, of 2019 NW Third Ave., Sun-
day afternoon with being an accessory 
to murder. A second suspect, Jonathan 
Rashad Peterson, 26, was charged with homicide and possession of a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon after he turned himself in to police Monday.
At about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, Eu-
gene Shelton, 26, was shot in the chest at Rocky Point Apartments, 3100 SW 35th Place, during what police believe was a 
drug deal.
A 19-year-old woman drove Shelton 
to Shands at UF, where he was taken into surgery. At 2:50 a.m. Friday, Shel-
ton died from the gunshot wound, ac-cording to a GPD press release.
The woman who drove Shelton to the 
hospital told police that Shelton called 
someone to arrange a meeting for a drug 
deal in the apartment 
complex, according to an arrest report.
Police searched 
through Shelton’s phone records and discovered the num-ber Shelton called 
before the shooting 
belonged to Williams.
According to the report, Williams 
was interviewed twice by police.
During the ﬁ  rst interview, Williams 
said he loaned his cellphone to Peterson

Josseline Paulino arrived at Preview this 
summer with a clear career path in mind.
Although she has wanted to become a 
doctor since about age 12, she never consid-
ered majoring in biomedical engineering to get there.
When the major was introduced at Pre-
view, Paulino’s interest piqued.
“I thought it was really cool, so I looked 
it up and fell in love with it,” the 18-year-old freshman said.
UF’s College of Engineering is offering a 
biomedical engineering major this Fall for the ﬁ  rst time. The inaugural class has 20 stu-dents, but the program will expand to accept 30 students in Fall 2013, said Hans van Oost-
rom, the undergraduate coordinator for the 
new bachelor’s program.About 70 freshmen have indicated inter-
est in the major, van Oostrom said. The gen-
der split is about 50-50.
The freshmen haven’t yet been accepted 
into the major, but many of them are taking 
critical tracking courses with plans to apply 
for the major later on. To be admitted into 
the limited-access program, applicants must complete four semesters of the prebiomedi-cal-engineering semester plan.
The major combines core engineering 
courses with biology courses, van Oostrom said. Each student in the program chooses a speciﬁ  c track within the major, such as neu-
ral engineering, medical physics or imaging, 
biomechanics or biomaterials.
“They come out with not just general Biomedical engineering now

Sixty percent of students in-
tended to work full- or part-time 
jobs after their spring graduation, according to survey data from the Career Resource Center, Office of 
Institutional Planning and Research and the registrar’s office. About 30 
percent aimed to pursue graduate 
school.
The spring survey had a 50 per -
cent response rate, said CRC Direc-
tor Heather White, but completing it became mandatory this summer.
The spring results showed the CRC was an integral part of stu-dents’ post-graduate employment, 
White said. It helped 28 percent of 
surveyed students find jobs.
Kellie Nelson, 22, was one of 
them. She graduated with a degree in English but works as an account director for an insurance firm.Her situation isn’t unusual — 
about 80 percent of students’ first 
jobs are not on their intended career 
path, according to a Rutgers Univer -
sity survey from May.
Even though Nelson’s work 
isn’t directly related to her degree, she was still intrigued when the job came up at a UF career fair.
“Once I heard about [the posi-
tion], it piqued my interest,” Nelson said, “and I decided to seek the op-portunity.”
UF’s survey does not ask students 
if the job they’ve secured is one they were seeking, White said. Career Resource Center survey finds UF graduates intend to workknowledge but also specialized 
knowledge in one area of biomedical engineering,” van Oostrom said.
Alex Koblick, 20, has already cho-
sen neural engineering, which in-volves studying the nervous system, as his specialty. The junior is one of 
the 20 students officially enrolled in 
this Fall’s program.
Koblick said he knew the college 
didn’t have an undergraduate bio-medical engineering major when he 
started at UF, but he hoped the pro-
gram would be added.
“I always kept my eye on it, and I kept it in the back of my mind,” Koblick said, adding that he shares many of his classes with graduate students.
UF has had a graduate biomedi-
cal engineering program since 2002, according to its website. About 140 graduate students are enrolled, van Oostrom said.
A combined degree program that 
would offer a bachelor’s and mas-ter’s in biomedical engineering may be available in 2013.
“It’s a great field to be in, and it’s 
growing very popular,” he said.
Students can look up the semester 
plan and learn more about the major at www.undergraduate.bme.ufl.edu.because he needed it to “make a play ,” or initiate a drug deal.
Williams said he only knew Peterson by his 
nicknames, “Head” or “Lucifer.” After the shoot-ing, Peterson gave the cellphone back to Williams and told him to erase all of his numbers.
Williams added he didn’t know Shelton was 
shot until he heard about it from a relative later, 
according to the report.
In the second interview with police, Williams 
changed his story, saying he knew Peterson’s 
identity and that Peterson told him he had shot 
Shelton.
Williams said he hid his cellphone and con-
tacted his phone carrier to change his number because he didn’t want to be connected to the 
murder.
During a six-person photographic lineup, Wil-
liams identified Peterson as the shooter.
Police booked Williams into jail at 5:07 p.m. 
Sunday.
At about 11:30 a.m. Monday , Peterson called 
GPD Detective Cpl. Benjamin Smith, and he later 
surrendered himself to police at the GPD Crimi-
nal Investigations Bureau, according to a press release.
Peterson was booked into jail at 12:49 p.m. 
Monday.
As of Monday night, Williams and Peterson re-
mained in jail. Williams’ bond was set at $50,000, while a bond for Peterson had not been set.

A Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office member carries a less-than-lethal weapon while watch-
ing protesters with a Broward County Sheriff’s officer in downtown Tampa, Fla., during the first day of the Republican National Convention on Monday.
Occupy Gainesville also attended
policies the organization believes are 
unfair to migrant workers.
Some were from Occupy Gainesville, 
which ran a continuous protest at Bo Diddley Community Plaza during the height of the Occupy Wall Street move-ment.
“It goes to show that your average 
Gator is more political than average,” Figueroa said.
“Gainesville has played a big role 
both in the organization and participa-tion of the march.”
Also at the rally were members of 
various Gainesville groups, including CodePink, the Civic Media Center and Gainesville Veterans for Peace.
Student activists said they braved 
the weather to oppose the Republican Party’s plans but that this doesn’t nec-essarily mean they support the Demo-cratic Party. 
Several UF activists plan to protest 
outside the Democratic National Con-vention as well.
“What we’re saying is we as people 
want affordable health care, we want 
jobs, we want peace, and we feel that 
neither party has been fulfilling that,” said Victor Yengle, a 23-year-old UF economics senior. 
“If we want to see that change, we 
have to be that change.”

Sara Hand never looked at 
her air-conditioned car with as 
much gratitude as she did upon returning from India.
The 21-year-old family , 
youth and community sciences senior was one of 15 UF stu-dents who studied abroad in India for five weeks this sum-mer.
The six-credit study-abroad 
program took students from Chennai to New Delhi, the cap-ital, to Jaipur. Students learned 
about various Indian nongov-
ernmental organizations and development, said Muthusami Kumaran, UF assistant profes-sor of nonprofit management and community organizations and the program’s director.
The group saw the orga-
nizations’ work, including an 
orphanage and results from mi-
croloans, and visited attractions like the Taj Mahal. Hand said seeing such contrasting scenes back to back was interesting.
“I wasn’t expecting to see 
these huge palaces, and then a little down the road, kids don’t even have any clothes,” she 
said.
Kumaran has taught lec-
ture courses on nonprofit 
management for the past three years but decided a firsthand experience would benefit stu-dents.
Kumaran said he chose In-
dia because it has the second-largest amount of nongovern-mental organizations in the world, at 1.3 million. The U.S. has the most, with about 1.5 million nongovernmental orga-nizations, he said.
Kumaran, who came to the 
U.S. from India in 1993, brought his wife, Leela, and 8-year-old daughter, Janani, on the trip. He and his wife acted as trans-lators between the students and non-English-speaking locals.
Harris Krause, a 19-year-old 
chemical engineering sopho-more, said he participated be-
cause he wanted to “get out 
of the engineering bubble.” Krause, who said India is as crowded as a packed Turling-ton Plaza, said the trip changed his perspective. Between using a bucket for cold-water showers and not having access to public drinking fountains, he was sur -
prised how simple many Indi-ans’ lives were.
“There were so many peo-
ple in India who didn’t have those amenities who were just as — if not more happy than — the average American family ,” Krause said.Students get hands-

Women should take 
care of themselves
There are so many threats against women in America to-
day.
Between trying to earn our reproductive freedom and 
explaining that we deserve equal pay, it can be difﬁ  cult to re-member that we’re not second-class citizens.
We have to take care of ourselves, because it seems like our 
government and our companies aren’t going to help.
Because there are so many things that can go wrong in our 
bodies, we need to monitor them and take the best care of our-selves possible.
About 42 million women are living with some kind of car-
diovascular disease. About 200,000 women die each year from heart attacks, which is ﬁ  ve times the number of women who die from breast cancer.
Two weeks ago, Rosie O’Donnell, one of TV’s favorite lesbi-
ans, suffered a heart attack.
She helped an “enormous” lady out of her car and later didn’t 
feel normal.
According to her blog, a few hours later, she experienced 
body aches, including chest pains, nausea and other symptoms of heart attack. 
She Googled womens heart attack symptoms but still wans’t 
sure. 
From her blog:“i took some bayer aspirin
thank god
saved by a tv commercialliterally”When it feels like the entire world is generally out to get us, 
women need to be prepared and ready.
Take control of your health, ladies.The risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, 
high blood cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, being overweight and being physically inactive. These can be changed for the better, 
but only if you’re aware of them.
According to the Mayo Clinic, there are seven major threats 
to women’s health: heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic lower 
respiratory disease, Alzheimer’s disease, accidents and type 2 diabetes.
Thankfully , freeing yourself from some of these threats is as 
easy as eating healthy and exercising. Include in your diet more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains; decrease your intake of saturated fat and sodium.
When there is legislation enacted in this country that limits 
women’s rights and freedoms, we should take that as a hint. Our government is giving us a gigantic clue, ladies.
It is up to us to take care of our bodies, because we may not 
always be able to ﬁ  nd help.
Now, not every politician is leading a witch hunt against 
women. But when even celebrities, like O’Donnell, are in denial of possible symptoms at the onset of a heart attack, then our edu-cation system has failed us.
Traditionally, heart disease is thought of as a man’s disease.Don’t make an assumption when it comes to your health.Emphasis should be on self-image, not appearance
Welcome back! In honor of the fresh and new theme of back-to-school season, I say we bury the idea of the acronym “YOLO” (you only live 
once), and choose to embody another expression by famed rapper Drake.
Lyrics in his song “The Real Her” mention being “proud 
of the fact that you’ve done it your way.” As young indi-viduals, we have an extraordinary opportunity to be what-ever we choose. As creative as our generation is, physical appearance has become a rather popular outlet of expres-sion. From what I’ve seen, young adulthood is the perfect time for people to experiment with their individual styles.
However, appearance has overshadowed a deeper im-
age of ourselves.
For ladies, something like a change in hair color or a 
drastic cut might be on the list of things to try. Dark to light, light to dark, chemically relaxed to natural; if you want to make a change, go for it. Just do yourself the favor of knowing it’s something you want to try for yourself and not someone else’s approval.
Always remember your individuality comes from with-
in.
Guys, if you want to grow out your hair, so be it. Walk-
ing through campus, I have seen afros, long and shaggy hair, ferocious beards and much more. However, I will tell you more young ladies than you think prefer a well-groomed look over anything too wild.
Take note that college is also a preprofessional environ-
ment and a number of inﬂ  uential people you will be in con-tact with feel the same way.
Multiple piercings all over the body are also popular 
these days. They are not too awe-inspiring, in my eyes. 
However, the world (including the traditional generation 
that came before us) is becoming somewhat accepting of these youthful trends.
Surprisingly, I’ve worked in a number of professional 
establishments at which nose rings and small tattoos were visible and seemingly not a problem. Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that in the real world many of our employers might not be as accepting.Speaking of, the most over-
whelming trend has to be the rise of the tattoo.
So many people have them. It 
feels like not having one is what 
actually makes a person unique. I 
walk around campus and notice people’s tattoos peeking out from under their clothes more so than I see their outﬁ  ts. The general idea 
tells us a tattoo can make even the prettiest or nerdiest guy seem just a little bit cooler or tougher. The nicest and most innocent girl becomes a little less prude. I have to disagree when the tattoos are essentially meaningless.
Be cautious. These engravings of the skin are perma-
nent and will more than likely alter in appearance as you and your body change and age. More than likely your feel-ings about them will do the same.
My advice to you? If you think about making one of 
these changes to yourself, use reason and, more impor-tant, have one. Now is the time to try things, but be safe, and make sure you stay in control. Your body is a temple. Many will choose to adorn it, but most vital is that people 
take measures to respect it.
When it’s all said and done, after changing ourselves, 
we are still the same people.
When everything comes off of your body, only you will 
be left standing there.
How fancy your clothes and hair look or how cool your 
tattoos and piercings make you seem are actually irrele-
vant. The thoughts in your brain, the personality you show and the soul inside your heart require a different kind of 
adornment.
Embrace whatever is inside yourself and know that it

A vaccine to the human immunodeficiency virus, 
stemming from the productivity of Thailand’s on-going trials, is close to acquiring a license in the 
U.S. After that, and years of trials in which it would be administered to every subject the distributor can get its 
hands on, the drug would then be inspected in line with 
its production notes, actual production and the inspection of its production facility.
Assuming that all of the guidelines are met, the vaccine 
would begin ascension into the market of commerce. The market is where the line is drawn, and the final product becomes candy for the eyes of affluent window shoppers — the key word being affluent.
Because despite the fact that HIV has been responsible 
for the decimation of several less prosperous Western civ-ilizations and the deaths of an unquantifiable number of remembered lives, the vaccine will remain inaccessible to most of the population — at least the working class.
The first step to scrapping an issue is acknowledging 
the problem itself. The notion looks enough like common sense to take for granted, but actually putting the method to practice proves otherwise. It’s inconvenient. More so than almost anything else, it’s this reluctance toward ac-
knowledgement that has made this month’s HIV develop-
ments near obsolete for the 
general public — namely , a public that refuses to beg the question.
The short answer is that 
they won’t be able to afford it.
Although the incentive for the vaccine may have been 
the preservation of human lives, maintaining an uninter -
rupted production will force exorbitant prices coming out  the gate: six figures at best, an entirely different tax bracket 
at worst. And it’s an ugly practice, because it has to be.
The cost to create the vaccine includes the costs associ-
ated with lab maintenance, worker pay, volunteer com-
pensation and, if necessary , debt control. Like student loans, each of these debts has to be paid, regardless of the consequences otherwise. The moral agenda is an im-portant one, but even more important for the individual 
scientists is their abilities to put dinner on the table. So 
they’ll split the difference the only way they know how: from the buyer.
The problem is, the groups that most need the drug 
won’t be able to afford it.
No matter how effective it proves, until the price point 
is addressed, the vaccine won’t really exist at all. And al-though the common-sense solution might be clear, the ac-knowledgement of this inconvenience could be a harder 
pill to swallow than the cure itself.

Speaking Out
A phobia is defined as an irrational fear. 
People develop phobias for almost anything: spiders, heights and even 
beautiful women (really — it’s called “venus-traphobia”). Though phobias are technically 
a psychological phenomenon, words with 
the suffix “-phobia” have entered common parlance to denote prejudice against certain people as well.
One such phobia, commonly spoken of in 
the west, is Islamophobia.
Since the Rushdie Affair in 1989, and even 
more so since 9/11, distrust toward Islam in the United States has been high.
Negative attitudes toward Islam and its 
adherents have, in recent times, shown their most vicious face. This August, there were eight attacks at houses of worship, seven of which targeted mosques. The remaining one was the racially motivated shooting spree and domestic terrorist attack at the Sikh Gurdwara in Wisconsin, which killed seven people, in-cluding the shooter, and injured four.These attacks included a rifle shot at a wall 
behind which 500 people were praying; a bottle-bomb, which fortunately did not break through the targeted window; property de-facement including eggs, oranges, BB gun pel-lets and, perhaps most spiteful of all, pig legs.
The aversion has extended beyond such 
individual exhibitions. This month, the 
American Freedom Defense Initiative, an anti-
Islamic organization, ran anti-Palestinian ad-vertisements on San Francisco buses that read: “In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Is-rael. Defeat Jihad.”
Apart from the ahistoricism — as a friend 
pointed out, “If this was the guiding principle, Jews and Christians would have been obliter -
ated by the Romans 2,000 years ago,” — the ad reflects a factually inaccurate outlook. Whether in Israel and Palestine or in the U.S., it is not the Muslims who take first place in “savagery.”
According to B’Tselem figures from June 2012, since the Sec-ond Intifada began in September 2000, 6,627 Palestinians, in-cluding civilians and 
militants, and foreign citizens have been killed by Israeli security forces and citizens. On the other hand, the Palestinians have killed 1,826 Israelis, alleged Palestinian informants for Is-rael and foreign citizens.
In the U.S., according to an Anti-Defama-
tion League report from August 2011, 10 times more deaths have resulted from right-wing terrorism since 9/11 than from Muslim ter -
rorism. According to the report, which was written before the Gurdwara shooting, only 7 percent of deaths due to domestic terrorism were due to Muslim terrorists, as compared to 85 percent because of white supremacists.
Yet, it’s brown-skinned people who have 
almost exclusively faced increased racial pro-filing at airports. It is Muslims who have com-prised the entirety of American citizens killed on presidential orders without due process. And it is regarding Islam that a “phobia” has lodged itself into our language and thoughts.
There may be a fear of Muslims, but there is 
much more than that. The word “Islamopho-
bia” does not capture the hostility that extends 
beyond the fear; instead, it intrinsically down-plays it.
The point we should focus on in the current 
state of affairs is not that Muslims are objects of fear in this country, it is that they are victims of hate. They are hated for not conforming to the most popular religion in this country . And, perhaps most important, they are hated 
because they have been scapegoated as the 
enemy figure of our times to breed national-istic and religious solidarity, and deceptively portrayed by institutions of power as the great evil we must unite against.
The fact still stands: Islam is hardly the big-
gest threat to the people of this country.

HIV vaccine 
plagued by priceUWire
There seems to be an age craze in American society . 
People regularly say , “I only date younger women,” “I only date older men,” or vice versa.
It’s completely understandable. Some people want an 
older person’s maturity in their lives. Some people want a 
youngster with a hot, rocking body. Everyone has prefer -
ences.
I’m generally attracted to older men. They have better sto-
ries to tell, simply because they’ve lived longer.
But, a recent exploit has caused me to realize there’s some-
thing to be said about dating a person one’s own age.
The person I’m referring to is only two years my senior.
The first time we went out, we split the bill at a restaurant. 
Being the cool, new-age guy he is, he accepted the cash with 
no problems. So, that’s a winning point for the person my 
age.
On our second date, we snuck bourbon into a movie the-
ater. I brought the bourbon. He paid for the tickets. Sounds fair to me.
Did I mention I brought the bourbon? That’s an essential 
point, because it’s the key reason we stumbled back to his place half-drunk after the movie. He also gets a winning point here: Older guys have little patience for keeping company with half-drunk girls. Younger guys would have been too hammered to drive home. Not the my-aged-man! He was a sober driver.
This is where things get sticky . 
The apex of the evening was whether or not we decide to have sex.
Granted, I was already leaning toward “yes,” because 
Southern Comfort does that to a girl. But, somewhere inside me was the notion to make him wait.
That is until he started playing all the R&B/pop songs of 
the early 2000s. “Soldier” by Destiny’s Child blasted through the speakers —  it was on.
Did I put out way too soon? Yes, absolutely. Do I have 
regrets? Are you kidding?
Not only did we use a condom (no glove, no love), but 
while wrapped in sheets later that night, we sang all the words to Usher’s “U Got It Bad.”
And, I think he really enjoyed being with a his-age girl, 
because we have plans to continue seeing each other.
Does it sound like I have regrets?J. Almendarez is a columnist for the Northern Light at the

Patriots Give Hernandez Contract Extension
Former Gators tight end Aaron Hernandez has reportedly signed a ﬁ  ve-
year contract extension with the Patriots with a $12.5 million signing bonus. The deal includes $16 million guaranteed and a maximum value of $40 million.  JOE MORGAN

 After months of competition, 
Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel 
will each have 15 minutes to earn the starting quarterback job. The sophomores remain in 
a dead heat.
  “[UF offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease] and I, right now, 
plan to play one in the ﬁ  rst quarter — we haven’t made that decision yet — and another in the second quarter,”  coach Will Muschamp said. “Then, at half-time, (we will) make a decision 
on how we move forward.”
  After suffering a left shoul-
der contusion during practice 
on Aug. 12, Driskel earned clearance for contact from team doctors  on Sunday. With both quarterbacks healthy, the com-petition will carry into the regu-lar season.
  Despite the uncertainty un-der center, Muschamp is com-fortable with Florida’s quarter-back situation.
  “Both guys are good play-
ers,” Muschamp said. “I have said it before, we’re not overly concerned with the quarterback 
p o s i t i o n and the t a l e n t we have there.”
  Depth Chart: Along with quar-terback, cornerback remains an undecided position battle.
  “Cornerback, again, those 
will all be gameday decisions,” Muschamp said Friday. “We’ve got some guys playing at a high level, but as much nickel and dime as we play, they’re all starters to me.”
  Mack Brown was named 
Mike Gillislee’s primary back-
up, but several players are ex-
pected to receive carries out of the backﬁ  eld against Bowling Green.
  “Mack’s a guy that I think 
has had a good camp,” Mus-champ said. “He’ll play deﬁ  -nitely Saturday. Matt Jones will also play in that role as well. 
Omarius Hines could see some 
opportunities. Chris Johnson, depending on how things are going.”
  Darrin Kitchens will start 
ahead of Neiron Ball at Sam linebacker on Saturday. Ball has been dealing with an unspeci-ﬁ  ed ankle injury recently, but he 
will play in the opener.
  Injuries: According to Mus-
champ, De’Ante Saunders will likely miss the Gators’ ﬁ  rst two games due to a hamstring in-jury.
  “He’ll sit the ﬁ  rst two games 
right now,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s got a hamstring, probably TUESDAY, AUGUST 28, 2012

 For as high as he jumped for UF track and 
ﬁ  eld as a former second-team All-American, 
Frankie Hammond Jr. fell ﬂ  at for the football team. 
  The redshirt senior arrived at Florida as the 
fourth-ranked receiver in the Gators’ 2008 re-cruiting class and backed up former stars Louis Murphy and Percy Harvin.
  Hammond, a Hollywood, Fla., native, red-
shirted his ﬁ  rst season.
  He ﬁ  nished 2009 with four catches for 57 
yards.   Over the next two years, he scored just two touchdowns and never eclipsed the 300-yard mark for a season.
  Hammond had his scholarship revoked due 
to a DUI arrest before his sophomore season, and he may not have had it returned were it not for the hiring of coach Will Muschamp.
 “It’s been different things why he hasn’t 
gotten the ball, but now you see it in practice,” senior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “He’s going out and making plays. He’s doing everything [the coaches] ask him.”
  And everything the coaches have left un-
said. Hammond helped bring along younger receivers in the offseason and built a rapport with sophomore quarterbacks Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett during player-run practices.
  “Throughout the summer both Jeff and 
Jacoby felt very comfortable with Frankie,” Muschamp said. “He’s a guy that is an expe-rienced player. He’s a guy that brings that to the table.”
  Hammond and sophomore Quinton Dun-
bar were listed as the two starting receivers on the depth chart UF released Monday. 
  Florida has just two other senior offensive 
skill players — Mike Gillislee and Omarius 
Hines. 
  Although Hammond has caught just 41 
passes in his career, that total is still only nine 
behind the combined count of the other 10 re-ceivers on the roster.
  When the wideouts 
went over the new play-book from offensive coor-dinator Brent Pease during 
the summer, they depend-
ed on Hammond for guid-ance, and he wasn’t afraid to chime in.
  “I can give them a lot of 
insight,” Hammond said. 
“They (may) have ran a route bad, and are like, ‘What can I do to get better?’ Well you can try this or you can try that. Sometimes they can 
run a bad route and I come back before they 
even say anything.”
  His knowledge came from working with 
four different offensive coordinators and four 
quarterbacks.
  “It comes from previous playbooks,” Ham-
mond said. “I try to learn every position, so that way if somebody goes down, I can just plug in anywhere and ﬁ  t in.”Hammond climbs depth chart 
  The Florida offense isn’t missing 
just one or two pieces: The entire unit is a mess beyond a single 
year’s worth of repair. 
  Last season’s attack ﬁ  nished No. 105 
in the NCAA, then lost its three lead-ers in total offense to graduation and saw one of the game’s greatest offensive minds leave to take the head coaching gig at Kansas. 
  But even without John Brantley , Jeff 
Demps, Chris Rainey and Charlie Weis, some are optimistic about the offense in 2012. 
  Color me confused.   Will Muschamp brought his jalopy 
to the shop, the mechanic gave it back to him missing three tires and a steering wheel, and he’s expecting it to run bet-ter. 
  With Brent Pease on board, the Gators 
plan to shift to a downhill, run-heavy of-fense. How exactly is that supposed to 
work?   Everything 
we’ve heard 
out of camp is that Mike Gil-lislee is far and 
away the No. 1 
back. It’s easy to look at his 5.9 yards per 
carry last season and think he could be in for a big year, but take a closer look. Of Gillislee’s 56 carries, only two came during second-half, one-score situations. Two! The vast majority of his work came 
against defenses that were worn down 
and demoralized, or against teams who were so far ahead that they didn’t re-ally mind if he ran for six yards on ﬁ  rst down. 
  Now he’ll ﬁ  nally get his shot, but 
maybe it’s worth wondering why he hasn’t already . Are his pass protection UF attack has gaping holes END OF GREGULATIION

Saunders started nine

skills that hopeless? Does he have 
nagging injury issues we haven’t been told about? Can he catch the ball? 
Any or all of those issues could be 
in play in 2012, and it’s hard to build an offense around a lead back who didn’t catch a pass in 2011. 
Even the running side of the equa-
tion seems shaky, given UF’s horren-dous struggles on the offensive line last season. I could see hope for the unit’s improvement if there were new players involved, but neither 
D.J. Humphries nor Jessamen Dunk-
er have cracked the starting five. 
The offensive linemen will tell 
you they can succeed because of chemistry and cohesion, then in the next breath say they don’t know who is starting where because reps are split so evenly . 
They’ll tell you things will be dif-
ferent because of a new strength pro-gram, even though a lack of agility and technical ability had much more to do with 2011 struggles. 
They’ll even tell you that another year of experience makes them bet-ter, but how much stock can really be put in that? With the exception of Chaz Green, who is entering his ju-nior season, all four projected start-ers are beginning at least their fourth year on campus. I can buy freshman to sophomore jumps, and I can buy 
jumps from Year 2 to Year 3. But if 
you want to tell me that a guy who has been here for three years will suddenly bust out in season four, I’ll believe it when I see it. 
Sure, the defense will be great. 
But how much better can it be than last year, when it finished No. 8 na-tionally and the team went 7-6?
On top of the issues at running 
back and offensive line, there’s the unproven quarterback situation and the invisible wideouts. 
So, unless the defense is going to 
shut out every team it plays, I have a hard time setting the over/under any higher than 6.5 wins. 
Too many pieces need improve-
ment, and there’s only so much a lackluster group of players can do in one offseason.

Wideout showing added maturity
Hammond has been the most 
consistent receiver on the roster 
with his blocking, hands and route running, Muschamp said. 
Each of those skills has been 
critical, as coaches have said there’s more to playing receiver than simply running fly routes.
“They better catch balls and block,” Pease said. “If you came here thinking, ‘I was labeled this, labeled that,’ you might not see some people. You go out there and you make plays. That’s the bottom line at that position. We don’t want any of these Terrell Owens guys.”
He may not be the flashy 
game-changing playmaker UF needs, but Hammond has ma-tured on and off the field.
Although he doesn’t have the speed of Andre Debose or the size of tight end Jordan Reed, Hammond has climbed to the top of the depth chart and helped some of his younger teammates along the way . 
“He’s been a really good 
friend,” Muschamp said. “He’s always been a pretty consistent guy . He’s tried to affect people in a positive way off the field.”

Florida coach Becky Burleigh said the Gators tightened up their defense following 
their loss to Miami. The result was improved play against North Carolina and Duke.
� UF LOST TO UNRANKED MIAMI, BUT 
REBOUNDED TO BEAT NO. 2 DUKE.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
 
During the span of just three games, the 
Gators women’s soccer team has looked like 
two wildly different units. 
The Gators began the season No. 21 before 
falling 4-1 to unranked Miami.
“When we went down against Miami, it 
took us by surprise,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “We were not ready to be in that posi-tion.”
After a week of practice, Florida traveled to 
Chapel Hill, N.C., to play No. 14 North Caro-lina and No. 2 Duke. The Gators appeared to be in danger of starting 0-3 for the first time in the program’s 18-year history.
But a different Florida team took the field 
against North Carolina.
The Gators came out much improved on 
defense and, despite a few close calls, held the Tar Heels scoreless for 110 minutes to secure a draw.
Florida quickly fell behind 2-0 against 
Duke on Sunday, but the Gators held their own with newfound confidence and scored 
before the half.
“I felt like during the Duke game we knew 
that we could play with them,” Burleigh said. “At halftime, I don’t think there was a single 
player in the locker room who didn’t think we were going to win that game.”
Florida made an improbable comeback and 
beat Duke 3-2 in overtime on a goal by senior forward Erika Tymrak.
“It was all a learning experience,” Tymrak 
said. “We took things from [the Miami game] and we had to work on them. Same for UNC, we talked about it after the game, what we had to work on.”
Tymrak played a key role in the Gators’ im-
proved offense last weekend. She scored the game-winning goal against Duke and created another when she directed a cross into the box that deflected off a defender and bounced into the net for an own goal. On Monday , Tymrak 
was named Southeastern Conference Offen-
sive Player of the Week.
Florida was more efficient on offense 
against Duke than it was against either Miami or North Carolina. Though the Gators had only four shots on goal, they converted two of them into scores.
 “Against Miami, we had no width in our 
attack,” Burleigh said. “We were trying to play 
four players where you could probably throw 
a blanket and cover all of them. Not good for offense; on offense you want to be spread out.
“Against UNC, we did a terrific job of get-
ting wide, but we didn’t do a very good job of finding those players wide. And finally against Duke, we sort of put it all together. We kept our width and actually used those play-ers out wide.”
After allowing three goals off of set pieces 
against Miami, UF’s defense improved dras-tically and prevented UNC and Duke from 
scoring on any set pieces. 
“It’s a tough thing to work on in practice 
because you’re just basically encouraging 
people to beat each other up,” Burleigh said. “The players embraced that challenge, and when we played against those two teams this weekend, it was a much, much more physical presence out there.”
Although Florida has played to both ex-
tremes in their first three games, Burleigh knows which team she expects to show up for the rest of the year.
“I knew which team was our team even 
before that Miami game and after that Miami game,” Burleigh said. “If we had to use that Miami game to progress to where we are now, then maybe it’s a blessing in disguise.”Florida rounding into form
