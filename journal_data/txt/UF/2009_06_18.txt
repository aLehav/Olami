Cell phones have been the tar-
get of a recent spate of thefts at 
the Southwest Recreation Center, according to reports filed with the University Police Department.
Four phones — three iPhones 
and one BlackBerry — were re-ported stolen from Sunday to Tuesday.In all of the cases, the alleged 
victims were playing basketball and left their phones somewhere nearby, only to find them missing when they returned.
While two phones were sim-
ply lying on the ground, one was tucked in a shoe and another was inside a backpack.The first incident occurred Sun-
day between 5 p.m. and 5:30 p.m, 
the second incident occurred Monday between 6 p.m. and 
8 p.m. and the last 
two happened just after midnight 
on Tuesday, according to the re-ports.One theft reportedly occurred 
inside the building. It wasn’t clear whether the other phones were stolen inside or outside.
“There are folks who hang out 
there that wait for people to put stuff down,” said UPD Lt. Robert Wagner.
He said the thieves — or thief — who stole the phones could be students dressed in gym clothes who don’t seem suspicious.
“We highly recommend that 
people do not leave their stuff un-
attended out there,” Wagner said. 
“There’s lockers to store stuff se-curely.”

� 44 UNITS WILL BE AUCTIONED.
BY SHELBY NEICHOY 
Alligator Contributing Writer 
With the housing market slump in full 
force, developers and real estate agents are looking for creative ways to sell properties.Developer Peter Wenzel is hoping buyers 
will be persuaded to open their wallets on June 27 when 44 of his condos at The Gables go up for auction.
“This is very exciting for Gainesville,” 
Wenzel said.  “It is the first real estate auction of this caliber.” 
Both two-bedroom, two-bath and three-
bedroom, three-bath condos are for sale. All units include a kitchen, washer and dryer and attached garages.
The National Auction Group 
will conduct the sale.  Company president William Bone said the location and speed of the sales 
will attract buyers. The first five condos will 
be sold regardless of the offer, he added.
“If you bid a dollar and no one bids two,” Bone said, “it’s yours.”
Matt Price, a realtor and condo specialist 
for Campus Realty, said that while auctions 
often pay off, a buyer should be prepared to make repairs to the property.
“Assuming a few more risks,” Price said, 
“you can get a better deal.”
The auction will take place June 27 at 11 
a.m. at The Gables.Thieves target cell phones at campus gym

More buses and a new 
route may make UF’s campus 
more accessible this fall, but 
the changes will come out of students’ pockets.
On Aug. 16, Route 22, from 
Forest Park to UF, will begin 
service and additional buses 
and runs will be added to sev-eral routes, according to The-resa Harrison, Regional Tran-
sit System spokeswoman.
“[This] will provide more seating and hopefully a bet-ter transit experience that will 
reinforce and encourage more people to ride the bus,” Har-rison said.
The changes will be funded 
by a 68-cent increase to the UF student transportation fee, which students pay in addi-tion to tuition.
The UF Transportation Fee 
Committee approved the in-crease from $6.11 per credit hour, to $6.79 per credit hour,

MIAMI — A federal judge in Miami has 
lifted an injunction that prevented the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers from building a one-mile bridge on a road through the Ev-erglades.
The Corps claims the bridge is needed to 
help restore natural water flow through the Everglades.
The work was challenged by the Micco-
sukee Indians, who consider the Everglades their ancestral home.U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro on 
Tuesday dismissed the case and lifted her previous injunction.
She cited the 2009 Omnibus Act, in which 
Congress funded and ordered construction of the bridge. The judge says she no longer has jurisdiction.
The project is part of a multibillion-dollar 
plan to restore the Everglades.
The Miccosukee tribe plans to appeal.

NY man charged with
impersonating dead mother 
NEW YORK — Irene Prusik 
has been dead for six years. But in 
April, someone showed up at the 
Department of Motor Vehicles in Brooklyn to renew her driver’s 
license. The explanation given by 
prosecutors rivals the Hitchcock classic “Psycho”: It was her son, in drag.
Thomas Parkin, 49, was 
charged Wednesday in the bi-zarre plot to impersonate his de-ceased mother so he could collect $117,000 in government benefits. 
He and the man accused of being 
his accomplice, Mhilton Rimolo, pleaded not guilty to grand lar-ceny, criminal impersonation and 
other charges.
Both men were ordered held 
on $1 million bail. Their lawyers 
did not immediately respond to phone messages left on Wednes-
day.
District Attorney Charles 
Hynes said the scam was “unpar-
alleled in its scope and brazen-ness.”
Authorities claim that follow-
ing his arrest, Parkin told them that because he held his mother when she breathed her last breath, 
“I am my mother.”
Parkin, who lived with his 
mother, was accused of hatching 
the scheme after she passed away in 2003 at age 73. He managed to 
conceal the death by falsifying her 
death certificate, then collected $52,000 from her $700-a-month 
Social Security checks over the 
next six years, prosecutors said.

“This decision may be one of 
Florida’s greatest conservation stories,” said Commissioner Brian Yablonski.
The new rule will allow a 
person to take one turtle a day from the wild for most species. 
Four species that are not of con-
cern to state scientists received a little less protection. Individuals can take two of those turtles a day.
The state’s roughly 28 li-
censed turtle farms will be al-lowed to continue collecting some wild species to keep their farms going under a “tightly controlled” permitting process.

Fla. man rents out homes, 
fakes foreclosures
WEST PALM BEACH — 
Authorities said a South Florida 
man and former police officer used bogus paperwork to il-legally evict people from fore-
closed homes and then rented 
out the homes, netting him as 
much as $6,000 a month in rent.
Carl Heflin is charged with 
organized scheme to defraud, 
committing a criminal process 
under color of law, burglary and 
grand theft.
Palm Beach County Sheriff’s 
Office said 51-year-old Heflin used bogus warrant deeds and a 
junk legal justification he called 
“adverse possession” to seize and plunder around 30 houses.
If the house was locked, 
authorities said Heflin would 
break the windows, change the 
locks and rent it out.
Kathryn Gadoury said she 
came home one day to find her 
front door off its hinges and 
Heflin bolting a new one in its place.

Obama: More benefits for 
gay workers only one step 
WASHINGTON — President 
Barack Obama signaled to gay-
rights activists Wednesday that 
he’s listening to their desire for 
greater equality in “a more per-fect union.” But he didn’t give them even close to everything they want, bringing to the sur-
face an anger that’s been grow-
ing against the president.
“We all have to acknowledge 
this is only one step,” Obama 
said in the Oval Office, where he 
signed a memorandum extend-
ing some benefits, such as visi-tation or dependent-care rights, 
to the same-sex partners of gay 
federal employees.
But the president’s critics — 
and there were many — saw the incremental move to expand ON CAMPUS
Student busted for stealing 
abandoned bicycle
If you’ve ever thought about 
nabbing an abandoned bicycle off 
a bike rack on campus, maybe you should think again.
A UF student biking to the gym 
last week saw a bicycle he figured 
was abandoned and decided to 
take it home. 
As a result, he was banned from 
that part of campus and is facing possible sanctions from UF.
The 23-year-old senior, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the bike was rusty, missing its front tire and looked like it hadn’t been ridden in a long time.
There wasn’t even a lock on it, 
he said. 
So, after deliberating, he de-
cided no one would care if he just took the bike home and gave it to 
his friend who needed a bike.
But as he was walking along 
Museum Road with the two bikes 
— the one he rode there and the newly acquired one — a Univer-sity Police Department officer spotted him and questioned him. 
The officer eventually banned 
him from the Lakeside Residen-tial Complex, where he found the bike, and referred him to UF’s Stu-dent Conduct and Conflict Reso-
lution.
The office heard his case on 
Monday and told him there was 
a good chance he won’t face any additional sanctions.
If that turns out to be the case, 
the student said he would also pe-tition UPD to lift its ban.
But if UF decides to punish 
him, he could face anything from 
conduct probation — meaning he 
couldn’t study abroad or be an of-ficer in a student organization — to suspension or expulsion.
The student said he wouldn’t 
have taken the bike if he knew someone still wanted it but real-ized what he did was wrong.
He said he shouldn’t have as-
sumed it didn’t belong to anyone.
“From now on I will make sure 
that I don’t make an assumption just based on convenience,” he 
said. “I was very glad I was cor-
rected.”
UPD Lt. Robert Wagner said, 
even though the bike was likely abandoned, it’s still a case of sto-
len property.
“He took something that wasn’t 
his, and he knew it wasn’t his,” 
Wagner said. “That’s wrong.”
The bike is now in UF’s posses-
sion, and UPD’s property manag-er will try to locate an owner. If no one claims the bike, it will be sold 
at auction like other abandoned 
bikes that UPD collects.

POLITICAL ACTIVISTS DETAINED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAIRO — International human rights orga-
nizations said Wednesday that many prominent 
activists and politicians have been arrested in re-
sponse to protests over Iran’s disputed election.
Hadi Ghaemi, director of the New York-based 
International Campaign for Human Rights, said he had spoken with family members and col-leagues of people who have been arrested or dis-appeared and was told that there were at least 200 across the country.
The Associated Press could not indepen-
dently confirm the rights groups’ reports due to government restrictions on reporting inside the country. The Iranian government has said that it has arrested a relatively small number of people responsible for violence and other crimes.
Ghaemi said one of the latest to be arrested 
was Ebrahim Yazdi, who was foreign minister after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini’s 1979 revo-lution and is now leader of the banned but tol-erated Freedom Movement of Iran. Ghaemi said Yazdi was arrested in the intensive care unit of Pars Hospital in Tehran.
Analyst Saeed Leilaz was arrested Wednes-
day by plainclothes security officers at his home, said his wife, Sepehrnaz Panahi. Ghaemi also said that Mohammad-Reza Jalaipour, another noted Iranian analyst, was detained.
The BBC’s Farsi-language news site said Jalai-pour is a student at Oxford and was arrested at 
the airport upon trying to leave Iran with his 
wife, Fatemeh Shams. A plainclothes officer did 
not give a reason for the arrest, Shams told the 
BBC.
Moussavi supporter Hamid-Reza Jalaipour is 
the detained man’s father and said he asked ev-eryone he could what had happened to his son, in an interview with BBC’s Farsi channel.
“Is it a crime to support Mousavi? That’s my 
only question now,” Jalaipour told BBC. “Man, they have fallen to attacking people’s wives and 
children.”
Amnesty International 
said that 17 political activists were detained and taken to 
“unspecified locations” Monday night after they staged a peaceful protest in a square in Tabriz, north-western Iran.
Amnesty said Ghaffari Farzadi, a leading 
member of the Iran Freedom Movement and a lecturer at Tabriz University, was also arrested, according to witnesses they spoke to at the uni-versity.
Amnesty said a crackdown on about 3,000 
protesters in the north-western city of Oroumiye led to the deaths of two people and the deten-tion of hundreds. In the southern city of Shiraz, tear gas was used in a university library where security forces beat students and detained about 100 people, the group said. And in the northern town of Babol, armed paramilitaries and plain-
clothed officials surrounded Babol University 
and targeted students in dormitories, witnesses 
told Amnesty.Rights groups: reformists

It took a while, but UF finally 
has an official Twitter account.
Steve Orlando, UF spokesman, 
said UF’s press office just couldn’t 
resist the Twitter hysteria any 
longer, so he finally registered an 
account — which can be found 
at twitter.com/UFNow — on 
Wednesday.
 “You can’t ignore it,” Orlando 
said of the popular messaging ser-vice, which allows users to post 
messages with a maximum of 140 
characters. “You do it at your own 
peril.”
He said UF decided to bite the 
bullet after a member of the press 
team attended a conference with 
other university press officers 
where they discussed the merits of 
Twitter.
So what has UF tweeted about?
The first two posts are about 
two books written by UF profes-sors that appear on Oprah’s sum-mer reading list.
As of Wednesday night, UF had 
seven followers and was following the tweets of Wyclef Jean, Nick Cannon and John Mayer, among others.
Orlando said those accounts 
were automatically added when he signed up and he would figure 
out how to remove them later.
Orlando said he doesn’t quite 
understand why other people 
Twitter about some of the things 
they do.
“It’s usually about, ‘Oh jeez, 
I just went to the bathroom,’” he 
said. “Who cares?”
He said UF’s tweets will usu-
ally be limited to about one per day and will likely be a summary of the most important news release 
of the day or other UF news that 
didn’t make it into a news release.
A few UF colleges, like the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the College of Journalism and Communications, already have 
Twitter accounts.UF signs up for

Hit and Run
A University Police Department officer walks a scooter that was involved in a traffic collision on the corner of 
Gale Lemerand Drive and Museum Road Wednesday morning. A woman riding the scooter was hit by a bur -

She walks her class route through the UF campus sev-
eral times before each semester starts. She goes to bed at 
10 every night, and she gets up at 8 every morning.  She writes exactly what she did that day in her journal and reviews it before she goes to bed. 
Abby Mize was in a car accident. On Nov. 12, 2005, a car crashed into Mize’s Toyota 
Echo as she left bowling practice at Palm Beach Central High School, where she was the captain for the varsity  bowling team. The accident was two days before the team went to a state competition.  
The car spun around three times and came to a stop in 
the middle lane. She was ejected from the back window halfway through the first spin.
The accident caused traumatic brain injury, damaging 
her frontal and temporal lobes and her optic nerve. As a result, she has no peripheral vision on her right side, has third-nerve palsy in her right eye, which prevents the eye from constricting and moving up, and some short-term and long-term memory loss. 
“I remember interacting was extremely difficult (im-
mediately after the accident), even now, but I think it bothers other people more than it bothers me,” she said. 
 Mize was in a coma for seven weeks out of the four 
she spent in the hospital following the accident. But Mize said the experience was fun. 
While she was in the coma, Mize dreamed she was in 
heaven with God, and he would tell her what was hap-pening around her.
The doctor thought she would die before Christmas, 
and Mize’s parents switched doctors soon after that.
Mize said she had to relearn even basic conversation 
skills after the coma. When she was going through physi-cal therapy, she and her mom would call a friend, put the phone on speaker and practice speaking with others.
 Learning to walk was the worst part of physical ther-
apy though, Mize said.

A student senate bill allocating 
$300,000 for improving the Student Gov-
ernment computer lab passed Tuesday night.
The proposed layout for the lab was 
approved by a fire marshal, Senate Trea-surer Maryam Laguna said.
“We’ll hopefully have it ready in fall 
when students get back to campus,” she said.
Laguna said she is also looking into 
improving the Reitz Union copy center and hopes to model it after a University of South Florida “one-stop print shop.” 
She plans to conduct a survey to see what 
students need and hopes to meet their re-quests with the new printing center.
Voting on funding for a proposed bug 
exhibit at the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History was postponed until the first meeting of Summer B to allow senators more time to research and decide. 
Sen. Neil Gun-
davda said he is more inclined to vote for the $60,000 allocation 
after speaking with a museum employee. 
“The fundamental point is that with-
out SG money, this exhibit wouldn’t hap-pen,” Gundavda said. “We can whine and complain about other budget cuts, but this one we can actually do something 
– we can provide funding.”
Maj. Brad Barber of the University Po-
lice Department attended the meeting to 
speak about public safety and the possi-bility of expanding SNAP to include off-campus locations.  
“SNAP is very dear to a lot of folks out 
there,” he said.
Barber said traveling in groups is the 
most important thing students can do to remain safe in the College Park area, which has seen muggings, robberies and other criminal activity over recent weeks. 
“It’s a common sense approach that 
you’ve heard for many, many years,” Barber said.
Senators also approved two bills to 
fund upcoming student projects, allocat-
ing $2,140 to the Mayor’s Council for an 
outdoor movie series called “Movies Un-der the Stars.” 
The event will feature four mov-
ies played at various outdoor locations around campus.
Though created last year for graduate 
families, the event is open to all students. The movies have not yet been chosen, 
but potential films include “Australia,” 
“X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” “Moulin Rouge!” and “Bride Wars.” 
Another $2,250 were allocated to help 
the UF branch of Camp Kesem, a national camp with student branches for children whose parents are or were victims of can-cer. The bill was passed in a roll call vote 64-4. 
At the end of the meeting, Sen. Josh 
Roberts requested that senators refrain from partisan attacks. Senators will have two weeks to ponder Roberts’ request, as senate is out of session until July 7. SG to pay 
$300K for lab upgrade

stem cells in an attempt to cure Lou Gehrig’s disease.
The schools will apply for an-
other five-year grant from the Na-tional Institute of Health, which has funded collaborative research on the disease between UF, UCLA and the University of Texas since 2005.
The current grant will expire in 
April.
According to UF neuroscience professor David Borchelt, if the 
grant is awarded, a team from UF 
and UCLA will try to find the cause of the disease, technically called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Its more informal name comes from former Yankees player Lou Gehrig, who retired in 1938 because of his illness. 
According to Borchelt, the team 
will request $5 million to be dis-bursed in $1 million increments over the next five years.
“We are asking for the most 
money possible for the project,” he said.According to Borchelt, most of 
the money will go to UCLA, which 
will have three labs working 
on the project, whereas UF will have one lab. 
While UF will 
continue to use cultured cells, 
UCLA biochem-
istry professor Ju-
lian Whitelegge, who has worked on the project since its advent in 2005, said the biggest change to the project will be adding an artificially made stem cell model.
Whitelegge said in the next five 
years he hopes to find a way to slow the progression of the disease and develop a drug that can stop it. 
There are about 5,000 new cases a 
year in North America and only 500 are the inherited version, which the project focuses on, Borchelt said.
There are more than 30 different 
types of inherited ALS, and each type gives a different life expec-tancy for the victim, said Mercedes Prudencio, a UF doctoral student on Borchelt’s team. 
In some cases, a person can have a year and a half before being put on 
a respirator, Prudencio said. But in 
other cases, a person won’t see seri-ous effects for 20 years or more. 
Stephen Hawking, a professor at 
Cambridge University known for his publications, has suffered from ALS most of his adult life. Diagnosed at the age of 21, Hawking, now 67, uses a machine to help him speak. 
According to his Web site, his 
condition has progressed more slowly than an average case of ALS.
“It is sad to see people paralyzed, 
conscious and [still understanding] everything,” he said.

� UF HAS RAISED $62M IN PRIVATE
DONATIONS SINCE JANUARY.
While UF is braced for $42.2 million in 
budget cuts, it’s also been raising money — 
about $62 million in private donations since the beginning of January. And to top it off, UF’s endowment has finally posted gains.
The endowment — a pool of private do-nations and state matching funds invested in stocks and fixed-income securities — is up just over 1 percent, totaling $1.01 billion.
That’s down from a peak of about $1.27 
billion in May 2005, according to numbers provided by Mike Smith, chief investment of-ficer of the group handling UF’s investments. For the fiscal year, which began in July, UF’s 
endowment is down about 18 percent.
The $62 million that UF raised so far this year follows record fundraising in Decem-
ber, when UF received $64.9 million.                                                                          
Since UF began its 
Florida Tomorrow capital campaign in July of 2005, it raised about $899 million. The goal is to hit $1.5 billion 
by September of 2012, which means UF is al-
most $80 million ahead of schedule.
Donations are down this fiscal year, with about 91,000 donations bringing in  about 
$127 million. Last year at this time, UF had received about 113,000 gifts for about $151 million.
Carter Boydstun, director of the cam-
paign, said he’s happy with the numbers.
“We’re pleased with where we are, espe-
cially given the economic conditions,” Boyd-
stun said.

Today’s question: I’m Ron Burgundy? 52% YES
48% NO
83 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Do you have trouble making decisions?Guest column
Government employees earn too much
Every summer we realize that another year has 
passed. We inch closer and closer to that terrible moment when we have to move beyond UF and 
figure out something to do with our lives.  
In the short run the answer is difficult. We’ve all 
played that game. In the long run the answer is easy. Work for the government. Why? Pensions, of course!  
The gap between pensions and benefits between 
the public and private sectors is jaw-dropping at best, criminal at worst. Private sector employees are over-whelmingly put on retirement plans called “Defined-Contribution” plans. Think 401(k). The employee puts 
in however much he or she chooses, invests it accord-
ingly and rides the waves of the market.  
Government employees, on the other hand, usually 
get “Defined-Benefit” plans. Think pensions. When they 
retire, they get a paycheck every month based on how 
much time they put in and their salary.  Defined-Benefit plans used to be the norm for everyone. Then the pri-vate sector learned that these were, in fact, too good to be true. Pension plans helped drive companies like GM 
(which spent $103 billion in pensions over the last 15 
years) into bankruptcy, and the government had to step in to save them. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corpo-ration, which assumes the pension plans of failed com-
panies, is now running a multi-billion dollar deficit and 
may face total liabilities of more than $100 billion.  
Does anyone else smell a bailout?  Sadly, government pension plans are in even worse 
shape. According to USA Today, government pension 
plans have about $4.7 trillion in unfunded liabilities 
— more than the entire US government (even under Obama) spends in a year.  But the great thing about the 
government plan is that it is backed by statute, unlike private plans, 
which are subject to market forces. 
When trust funds run out, taxpay-ers come in. The government has a grossly unfair, uncompetitive 
advantage over the private sector, 
and in recent years public employ-
ees have been making, on average, 42 percent more in compensation than private employees.  
Some public employees are even getting star-studded 
retirements. A 42-year-old police chief in Delray Beach, for instance, recently retired with a $65,000 per year sal-ary and full health care. He subsequently took a new job as a police chief and continued working.  
The system is wrong, granted. But under the Obamu-
nist regime government it is not getting any smaller. If the government grew under Reagan, we can only imag-ine where it will be in four years. Add that to the fact the unions have a stranglehold on almost every level of 
government, and you can be sure that dream of a cozy 
government retirement at age 50 isn’t going anywhere.  
You could do the right thing and fight the system 
and vote for people who will bring back fiscal respon-
sibility. But that takes so much effort. The much easier 
option would be to become a bureaucrat, sit behind a desk frustrating the hell out of people for 30 years and retire on the taxpayers’ dime in Guadalajara.
Don’t worry; there’s no shame in this. After all, 25 
million public employees can’t be wrong.

you to relax and crack open an ice-cold Zima.
Too bad we aren’t in Japan.
Hell, forget about mediocre “malternative” beverages for a

Before we celebrate at Ginnie Springs and watch our stom-

Darts & Laurels
In the world of sports, referee and umpires sometimes eject 
unruly players from the game. But an entire crowd getting the 
boot? There’s something you don’t see every day.
For completely overreacting by ejecting an entire crowd for 
heckling at a baseball game, the Department of Darts & Lau-rels tosses a hope-you-had-fun-because-that’s-the-last-game-of-
your-career DART at umpire Don Briggs. 
Was this a booze-fueled, expletive-laden, barn-burner 
between the Yankees and Red Sox? Try an Iowa high school game.
Call it an unspoken tradition passed on from generation to 
generation, the act of attempting to deface one’s high school 
yearbook is as American as prescription pill abuse. The Depart-
ment of Darts & Laurels awards a you-sir-are-a-man-amongst-
boys LAUREL to the Shaker Heights High School artist for 
drawing an F-bomb on the cover of the yearbook. Wasn’t that 
the name of some second-rate Shia “I used to watch my parents 
have sex” LaBeouf movie made back in the day?
When boredom ensues, the average person may turn to food 
or YouTube, but for a celebrity? Gratuitous nudity. For tweet-ing a link to a disturbingly gaunt topless photo of herself, the 
Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a you’re-no-longer-our-favorite-ginger-girl DART at Lindsay Lohan. There’s no deny-
ing the fact that Lohan, if given a burrito or 12, can turn heads 
with her looks, but hell, have you seen the photo?
Trust us, it isn’t quite “Mean Girls” Lindsay, if you know 
what we’re saying.
Beyond his physical prowess on the basketball court, Presi-
dent Barack Obama demonstrated yet another stunning skill on 
Tuesday. The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a maybe-Obama-missed-his-true-calling LAUREL to the commander-in-
chief for effortlessly killing a fly during an interview on CNBC. No word yet on whether insect-rights lobbyists are up in arms 
over the horrific incident.
If you’ve frequented a local watering hole or seven, getting 
up close and personal with the bar’s bathroom is nothing short 
of an alcoholic right of passage. For getting locked overnight in a drinking establishment’s restroom, the Department of Darts 
& Laurels launches a have-you-smelled-a-bar-bathroom-after-
a-long-night-of drinking? DART at the puke-scented mystery 
man. At least the bar didn’t charge him extra for not closing out his tab.
Let’s face it — not everyone is cut out to handle the rigor-
ous demands of a late-night talk show. No Conan, not you. The 
Department of Darts & Laurels extends a we-haven’t-laughed-
so-hard-since-we-first-watched-the-Slapchop-infomercial LAUREL to Artie Lange for tearing Joe Buck to pieces during 
the premiere of “Joe Buck Live.” Lange’s tour-de-force perfor-
mance showed viewers exactly why Joe Buck should rethink 
the no-tie, unbuttoned-collar look on HBO and keep his act in the FOX broadcast booth. 
One of the gems from the show wasn’t even from Lange, but 
rather former Dallas Cowboys Hall of Famer Michael Irvin who 
witnessed the verbal massacre from the audience. 
“It’s just refreshing to see white-on-white crime.”
That’s all for this week. Good luck on your final exams!Jonathan Lott

Letter to the Editor
Fans need to keep themselves in check
I went to the NBA Finals in Orlando this 
past weekend, and a fistfight almost erupt-
ed in my section after a group of rowdy, 
young Magic fans bombarded the Lakers 
fans in front of me with an endless chant of “LA sucks!” First of all, Orlando fans, people who live in prefab, cookie-cutter 
houses, should not throw stones. But more 
importantly, where on earth do you get the idea that your basketball team being up 10 points has anything to do with your city be-ing any better than anyone else’s? 
Now I realize that these guys were just 
having some fun at the expense of the visit-ing fans, but the attitude here points to a much bigger social deficiency that a lot of people have. And that is thinking that your 
sports team’s success has anything to do 
with you. That’s right, Gator Nation. When Tim Tebow and Urban Meyer raised that trophy back in January, it meant that they 
had accomplished a great feat. You, how-
ever, had accomplished absolutely noth-ing. “We” did not win anything. A bunch of extremely talented people who don’t know you from the homeless guy asking 
for change in front of the Kangaroo won. 
And don’t you forget it.
I’m not saying that one should not take 
some small amount of joy in his or her 
school or city’s team winning a game. Any 
time you can find happiness, take it. But don’t come after me if your school’s team beat my school’s team as if you are some-
how now better than me. Or, worse, your 
school is somehow better than my school. All you need to do is look north to Tallahas-see to see that athletic success has absolute-
ly nothing to do with scholastic quality.
Similarly, if you are the type of person 
who is depressed and refuses to go out af-
ter “your” team loses, you are just flat out pathetic. You still have a job, right? Your 
car didn’t get repossessed because Tim 
Tebow got stuffed on a 4th and 1 against Ole Miss. Your girlfriend didn’t dump you because the Dolphins blew a 14-point lead 
in the fourth quarter. But she probably will 
if you let your disappointment over their loss last any longer than it takes you to turn off the television.
If your life is so empty and meaningless 
that you need to live vicariously through a bunch of people you don’t know to feel good, then you need to do some serious 
self-examination. 
Treat sports as what they are: Reality 
TV with uglier people. The result of a game 
shouldn’t really affect your mood any more than the results of “Survivor.” You didn’t 
do anything, good or bad, so get over it and 
move on. 
Turn off the TV, go out and live your 
own life and leave the emotion of the games 
to those who actually played them.

One of the more ignored side 
effects of a recession is the toll it takes on friendships.
It seems kind of silly to worry 
about this when, in times of eco-
nomic hardship, physical worries 
dramatically outweigh emotional ones. After all, it’s easy and prob-ably not wrong to take an attitude of first figuring out if you can make rent this month, then speculating if your BFF charm bracelet is shiny enough.
But it’s worth noting, because, at 
least anecdotally, financial difficulty is one case where friendships can be more likely to accentuate how tough things really are than to provide an escape.
An underwhelming job market 
means people can’t be picky about where they get a job. “Proximity to loved ones,” once a reasonable crite-rion when deciding where to work, is now, at best, sentimentally naïve. At worst, it’s irresponsible.
And even if you’re willing to 
stand boldly and declare that being close to the ones you love is impor-tant enough to stake your career on it, it can be devastating when you realize your loved ones are simply unable to make the same gesture.
Geography is a bitch, and no mat-
ter how many promises are made to keep in touch with friends back 
home, there’s always an expectation 
to start living lives away from each other. It’s draining to be someone’s perpetual lifeline, and it’s unfair to place somebody in that position. The result is a game of emotional chicken that frequently boils down to, “I need you, but not so much that I freak you out.”
Intuitive -
ly, this should 
be a boon to new friendships, but 
that’s not always the case. People in 
the market for new friends are often people who just had to face the harsh realization that not all relationships are permanent and may decide that transient relationships are more trouble than they’re worth.
Really, that’s the most poisoning 
thing a recession can do to friend-
ships — the deprioritization of 
friends can all too easily lead to an attitude of indifference toward cur-rent relationships and an attitude of skepticism toward future ones. 
This is all a lot direr than it really 
is of course. Strong relationships can survive most anything, and even if they don’t, the ephemerality of a friendship shouldn’t diminish its meaning. But the recession acts as a stress test for relationships and as a stark reminder that the strength of a 
relationship isn’t measured by how 
well things go when times are good, but how strongly two people work to protect it when times are bad.
Last week, I visited a friend in 
Virginia whom I hadn’t seen in years. We kept in touch in the inter-im — phone calls, letters, Christmas gifts, Facebook — but it wasn’t until 
I saw her again did it fully sink in 
how different we had become.
She drove me back to the airport 
on my last day in Virginia. We did the goodbye stuff outside the termi-nal — hugs, I love you’s and a kiss — and I told her that it’s clear we’ve become different people, but if she’s in, I want to protect our friendship because she’s still important to me.
She grinned in a warm, you-
totally-rehearsed-that-in-your-head sort of way and said with a smile, 
“I’m in.”
With a major particularly sensi-
tive to economic downturns, I’m 
faced with a gloomy job outlook — an internship is no guarantee of a job, and a job is no guarantee of a career. Thus, any talk of wisdom gleaned from the recession is usu-ally met with cynicism from me.
I do feel, though, I’ve learned one 
thing from the recession: There are so many reasons why friendships fail, and it’s our responsibility not to let the stupid shit be among them.

Gainesville is known for its alliga-
tors, bats and, soon, butterflies.
The City of Gainesville will receive 
its Butterfly City Certification, the first 
being awarded in the nation, for its 
butterfly rain forest at the Florida Mu-
seum of Natural History. 
“It’s my favorite place on the 
globe,” said Gabriel Hillel, one of the founders of the Butterfly Education Project, the organization granting the certification.
Hillel and Peter Johnson, who owns 
his own small butterfly garden, started 
the quest to recognize Gainesville for 
its butterfly rain forest after students at the Caring and Sharing school for kindergarten to fifth grade enjoyed the time they spent learning about butter-
flies and making butterfly art.
“People get excited about going 
green, energy and light, but it is hard 
for children to grasp these concepts,” Hillel said.
According to Hillel, designating 
Gainesville as a “Butterfly City” will 
help continue to teach children how fragile 
the environment is 
while creating some 
excitement in eco-tourism. 
Gainesville has been designated as 
a “Tree City” for almost 25 years, and Hillel hopes this new “Butterfly City” designation will bring in more tour-ists. 
“What ‘Tree City’ did for 20th cen-
tury, ‘Butterfly City’ will do for the 21st century,” Hillel said. 8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009

A fight near 8 Seconds in downtown 
Gainesville early Tuesday led to three arrests 
and two Taserings and sent an officer to the hospital after he was hit with a concrete brick.
It’s not clear what triggered the incident, 
which happened around 1:40 a.m. Witnesses said two men were fighting before police ar-rived. After one of the men allegedly involved in the initial fight was Tasered and handcuffed, another man, surrounded by six officers, was brought to the ground after being Tasered. 
A woman, who declined to be identified, 
left and began crying, saying that she touched the man’s arm and was also shocked.
The already angry crowd of about 20 peo-
ple became even more agitated after this, with many of them yelling at the officers and accus-ing them of police brutality.
“They did not have to Taser him,” said Kyle 
Griffin, 22, a Santa Fe College student who watched the scene unfold. “They pointed the Taser at me too, and I wasn’t even part of this fight.”
One of the men arrested, Justin D. Chesser, 
22, was observed punching another man in the face and head multiple times, leaving a cut over the man’s left eye and bruises on the left side of his face, according to a police report. 
After being read his Miranda rights, Chess-
er told police the man “got near my girlfriend and was talking bad about my girlfriend so I whipped his ass,” according to the report.
“I have to get really mad to do something 
like that,” he told officers in the report.
Another man who was arrested, Cory A. 
Stephenson, 22, was Tasered after refusing to leave the scene, according to a police report.
Instead of leaving, the man turned to face of-
ficers and then pulled his arms away and struck an officer in the chest several times when police 
tried to handcuff him, according to the report. 
He also pushed the officer, the report states. 
He was Tasered for five seconds in response 
and then Tasered for another five seconds after he refused to remove his left arm from under his body, according to the report.
The third person arrested, Camalyne Rod-
gers, 19, was taken into custody after she sneaked past officers and kicked Chesser, who 
was on the ground, until officers restrained her, 
according to the report.
“They did not have to Taser him.”

Deliberations continue as Com-
missioner the Jack Donovan tries to 
persuade local government to add disadvantaged children as a pro-tected class under the city code of 
ordinances.
If passed, the city of Gainesville 
would be the first in the country to 
have disadvantaged children as a 
protected class. 
“We don’t have a bigger group 
that’s discriminated against than 
that group,” Donovan said in Wednesday’s Equal Opportunity Committee meeting.
Donovan gave examples of how 
socioeconomically disadvantaged children don’t get the proper start in life. 
“A disadvantaged child hears 
three negative words for every positive word,” Donovan said in the meeting, “and that is the opposite for middle-class children.”
Donovan suggested that adding 
disadvantaged children as a protect-ed class would promote more city in-
volvement and funding of programs 
and organizations geared toward 
at-risk children, such as early learn-
ing programs and Partnership for Strong Families, a local organization that offers child welfare services.
“Social change will only work if 
[efforts] are supported and backed by a government,” he said.
“We need to hold ourselves ac-
countable in a way we haven’t held ourselves accountable before,” he told the committee.
Jimmie Williams, Office of Equal 
Opportunity director, said he sup-
ported the idea absolutely, but that 
there would be some major road-blocks.One of the biggest roadblocks 
might be from a legal standpoint.  
Charlie Hauck, senior assistant 
city attorney, said that it would be hard to prove whether a potential ordinance violator knew of a per-son’s socioeconomic status.
“Say the criteria for discrimina-
tion is having a household income under $20,000,” Hauck said. “People don’t have signs on their chests that say ‘I have a household income of 20K.’”
“You can see if someone is Afri-
can-American or a woman, but [in-
come level] is not an obvious charac-
teristic,” Hauck said. 
Because of the unknown legal 
implications the change in the dis-
crimination section of city ordinanc-
es may possess, city legal staff will have to further research the issue before presenting it to the City Com-mission.
In the meantime, Commissioner 
Craig Lowe said the community needs to prioritize education to be “just as desirable as scoring a touch-
down on Friday nights.” CITY GOVERNMENTCommissioner fights for kids
said.
UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando said the changes di-
rectly benefit UF students.
 “I think it’s important to 
remember that those routes 
they are talking about are in 
areas where there is a large 
student population,” Or-lando said. “Other people might benefit from it, but the students are going to be the 
heaviest users.”
RTS worked with the UF 
Transportation Committee 
to redesign the routes with 
UF’s service goals in mind, 
Harrison said. 
Orlando said that the upcoming changes made through the partnership be-
tween UF and RTS will have 
far-reaching benefits. 
“I think it benefits the 
s t u d e n t s 
because it makes it 
easier for 
them to 
get to and from cam-
pus, but it 
also gets 
more cars off the road, so it benefits the environment as well,” said Orlando.
Schedule brochures will 
be updated with the new routes and will be available on bus stop kiosks and the 
RTS Web site.Transportation fee will 
increase by 68 cents

What happens on stage at a Get 
the Led Out concert is something 
unlike anything any Led Zeppelin fan has ever experienced. 
It is something probably not even 
“The Mighty Zep” themselves could have envisioned. 
But it must be made clear  that 
concert goers are not in for an im-
personation of original Led Zeppe-
lin shows, or even something like a studio session.
“It’s like it’s 1975 all over again,” 
said Paul Sinclair, lead singer and one of the three original band mem-bers of Get the Led Out, one of the country’s “premiere tribute bands.”
The band will make its Florida 
premiere Friday at 7:30 p.m., at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Per-forming Arts. 
Unlike the original format of 
Led Zeppelin, Get the Led Out consists of six members (instead of four), and a female vocalist, Diana Desantes, who comes on-stage for the song “The Battle of 
Evermore.”
The band, which is hailed as 
the “American Led Zeppelin,” 
started five years ago when bass player, Paul Piccari, called Sinclair. 
Piccari heard of Sinclair’s hard-
rock style and of guitar player Paul Hammond and wanted to put to-gether a Led Zeppelin show with 
them.
But the guys didn’t want to be 
like other tribute bands that dress 
up in costumes, learn, play and re-peat long improvisational jams.
 “I wanted to do something en-
tirely different,” Sinclair said. “We want to give [the fans] all the solos, the sounds, the guitar riffs — what 
they’re asking for.”
Sinclair said there is a whole 
subculture of tribute bands, and the 
competition is fierce.
But the tribute scene implies im-
personation, a term they don’t like.
Though the band members’ goal 
is to perfectly recreate the sounds and moods of Led Zeppelin, their 
performance and perspective to-
ward the music have changed throughout the years.
 “One thing I learned was that 
when Led Zeppelin recorded their songs, it was about capturing a mo-ment,” Sinclair said. “It wasn’t as thought-out as I thought it was.”
He said it is a real exercise in 
memory to learn someone’s improv from start to finish.
“They jammed around those mu-
sical ideas and created something unique,” Sinclair said. “Recreating that is something next to impos-sible.”
So long as everyone does their 
homework, it takes only a couple rehearsals to master some songs, as is the case with “Nobody’s Fault But 
Mine.” But of course, every song is 
different. 
The music gets smoother, better 
and closer to the record each time 
they play live, Sinclair said. 
To this day the band still revisits 
songs it learned five years ago. 
Recently, they learned how to 
play the main guitar riff in “Whole Lotta Love” even more like the orig-
inal. This was a particularly difficult 
song, and to them, one of the biggest rock songs of all times.
“With the pursuit of perfection 
and the enthusiasm of the audience it doesn’t feel like we’re playing the same songs over and over again,” Sinclair said. “Trying to make it that much closer for the fans makes it a 
challenge every single time”
Sinclair approaches the music as 
a fan. 
“The experience of a concert to 
me is pretty thrilling,” Sinclair says. 
“If I weren’t singing, I’d be watching in the audience ‘cause these guys are so awesome.”
Drummer Andrew Lipke, is well known in Philadelphia for his inter-nationally acclaimed ‘80s pop-rock band, Hit the Ground Running.
Lipke is considered by fellow 
band members to be a prodigy and a musical genius. He plays the harmonica, the banjo, electric and acoustic guitar and keyboards. He also does selected vocals and per-
cussion for the band. 
Sinclair himself also plays the 
harmonica for the band and on his 
own time plays drums, guitar and keyboards. But professionally, all his energy is focused on singing and managing his band. 
“It’s like having five girlfriends,” 
he said.
Managing a crew of 17, that is 
eternally on tour is taxing, he said. 
“Sometimes you wonder, ‘what 
did I do, I could’ve become a doc-tor, a lawyer,’ but when you’re on stage, and you’re looking out at 1,000 people who are huge Led Zeppelin fans, for those moments, it is total and utter bliss,” Sinclair 
said. 
When the band plays for more 
familiar crowds, they will some-
times introduce original songs.
“People are hungry for this kind 
of rock,” Sinclair said.
Their own music has a strong in-
Led Zeppelin influence. Singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin and 
Steven Tyler of Aerosmith are the 
reason, Sinclair said he made his life the mess it is.  
Sinclair and guitar player Paul 
Hammond have been playing to-gether since they were kids.
They are now traveling all over 
the country and have had offers to go abroad.
“Now, the sky’s the limit,” Sin-
clair said. 
The band members want to take 
the sound and fury of “The Zep” across the country and around the world to the big arenas where Me-tallica, Aerosmith and other greats have played.
 “Doing this is a freaking joy,” 
Sinclair said. “I plan on doing this until my last gaping breath.”music

sex on the avenueWitty, intelligent men set off ‘gaydar’ for some
Two months ago at a concert, a girl 
started grinding up against me. It’s not 
often a lady grinds on me first, especially with her boyfriend fuming nearby. So naturally I took great pride in the feat.
I later found out the girl thought I was 
a homosexual.
This is a terrifying blow to my repro-
ductive self-esteem. That girl didn’t think I was creepy, or ugly, or mentally re-tarded — she thought I was gay. At least creepy, ugly, mentally retarded guys can still have sex with women. Just ask Bret Michaels. 
But when women think you’re gay, game over. Sure, they’ll dance with you, touch you, ask your advice — but no sex. Their vaginas are as open as a Chik-Fil-A on a Sunday. 
Lately, my romantic life has been 
flashing before my eyes. I feel like I’m Bruce Willis at the end of “The Sixth Sense,” reevaluating all my previous flir-tations with the dread of uncovering the conspiracy that’s blinding me from my own homoerotic pheromones. 
When I sensed interest, was I merely a 
prospective shopping partner? Did they simply ignore all the passes I made?
“You got me! I wasn’t flirting. I’m just 
your friendly neighborhood homo, pre-paring girls for when actual straight guys hit on them. Now, where did you get that purse?” 
When it comes to my sexuality, the re-
cord sets itself “straight.” And by record, I mean the history tab on my Web brows-er. While a handful of those sites may have been hetero, I’m banking Freeones.com shall set me free. 
And if I survived four years of high 
school drama club wearing “Rent” T-shirts and still came out the other side with a fondness for vaginas, my face be-longs on a goddamn roll of paper tow-els.
I know I’m straight, so how come they don’t? My speech pathologist sister says the sibilant “s” is barely noticeable. I don’t use hair products. I generally abstain from making out with dudes in public. 
Maybe my wit is cock-blocking me. 
Girls don’t expect much cleverness from guys, so my approach might imply the wrong thing: “Who does he think he is, Oscar Wilde? Keep this one away from my little brother.” 
Still, I’m not dumbing myself down. 
You have to be true to yourself and tell the rest to take it or leave it.
I just hope “she” takes it and “he” 
leaves it. Two men discussed the dimensions in Esphyr Slobod-
kina’s paintings on Tuesday afternoon. I saw a jumping fox 
in one of them. 
The paintings in the “Rediscovering Slobodkina: A Pio-
neer of American Abstraction” exhibit, which opened at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art June 16, inspires imagina-tive thinking and interpretation — each piece is an invita-
tion to think outside the box to find its meaning. 
Slobodkina — a Siberian-born, American abstract painter 
started her career as a children’s book illustrator, making 
collage illustrations from colored paper. 
The imagination unleashed in these projects continued 
through her career, and her paintings and sculptures re-mained collage-like.
Slobodkina’s illustrative work, full of vivid color and 
whimsical patterns, lends itself perfectly to the creative fic-
tion of children’s books. Her continued use of color in later 
works is delightful as is her continued inspiration in collage-
like work. Several pieces in her collection are composed of an eclectic assortment of materials such as postage stamps, news-
paper sheets and fabric swatches, which 
layered onto a canvas, are in perfect agree-
ment with each other. 
There is a sort of cohesive theme in the exhibited works 
– something along the lines of future and travel. A part of the collection is arranged around the concept of a boat and its construction. 
The construction pieces are all focused on similar simple 
lines, showing the framework of a boat – their distinctive-
ness is in the artist’s capability of using unique brushstrokes 
and raw materials to create the feeling of differentiation. 
The futuristic aspect of her work is apparent in the “Jour-
ney into the Future” piece and the related studies, which are 
also on display. The piece, inspired by a photo of men in a 
telescope, can be interpreted as a colorful depiction of what one might see in the future world or, more simply, a bright outlook on things to come. 
The evolution of her sculpted works is also a sign of her 
innovative nature as they transition from wood and iron pieces in her early career to more complex metal pieces and the use of computer parts in her later career. 
Slobodkina lived to be 94 years old, and her creativity 
and imagination never slowed down. 
The pieces she created in the last years of her life, are just 
as vibrant and creative as those created in her illustrating 
days — revealing a woman who adapted well to the chang-
ing times and embraced the innovative spirit of the future.  Harn exhibit invites 
asbtract thinkingNestled on the corner of South-
west Depot Avenue and South 
Main Street lies an old red brick 
warehouse which, to the untrained 
observer, appears to be aban-
doned. 
Inside, The Kickstand bustles 
with activity. 
At 5 p.m. on Monday, in-house 
mechanic Andy Lievertz and his 
co-worker, a homeless man who 
calls himself Joe, scurry back and 
forth grabbing wrenches, checking 
tires and adjusting brake cable ten-sions. 
In the back area of the large 
room, which was converted into a fully functional bicycle repair facil-
ity in 2008, nine patrons repair flat 
tires and replace broken spokes. 
The seven other people in the 
shop peruse through The Grave-
yard, a messy corner, piled high 
with the frames of some 50 or more donated bicycles.  
The buzzing crowd is diverse, 
made up of UF students, lifelong 
Gainesville residents and a hand-
ful of homeless men and women with a common purpose: cycling. 
Unlike most bicycle shops, The 
Kickstand is a bicycle collective. Rather than pay a flat rate for bi-
cycle repair, cyclists can go to The 
Kickstand to fix a flat tire or even take advantage of the “Earn-A-
Bike” program, which teaches pa-
trons how to build an entire bike from the ground up in exchange 
for time or a spare parts donation.
The “Earn-A-Bike” program 
entails selecting a frame from The 
Graveyard and working with one 
of the mechanics to build a bike 
from scratch, Lievertz said. 
“We will assign a value to the 
bike, lets say $80. We will allow them to work for the bike at $10 an 
hour, so that $80 bike will be worth 
eight hours of work,” he said. 
Many of the people who benefit 
from the program cannot afford a bicycle. The Kickstand’s unique service offers them an opportunity to learn how to build and maintain 
a bicycle at no cost. 
“It’s for people who can’t af-
ford these sorts of things,” Joe said. 
“Just donate your time.” 
Joe knows what it is like to be 
deprived of something because 
of financial shortcomings — he is 
homeless. 
In the 17 months since open-
ing, The Kickstand’s cordial staff has built the shop a reputation as 
a friend of the homeless. 
A bulletin board displays a joint 
Certificate of Appreciation from The Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry and The City of Gainesville/Alachua 
County Office on Homelessness. 
But it’s not the recognition that 
keeps Lievertz coming in to volun-teer but rather the feeling of satis-faction he gets from helping out. 
“It’s a pretty regular thing that 
someone will come here. Maybe they don’t have a lot of money, or 
maybe they are homeless.” he said. 
“When I can get someone like that 
set up with the ‘Earn-A-Bike’ pro-
gram and put a bike into the hands of someone who really needs it, it’s 
a golden feeling.” around gainesville

AsianFrozen TreatsLittle Boots — Hands ���
Selected Tracks: “New In Town,” “Remedy,” “Symmetry”
   Little Boots brings warmth and talent to the often cold and repetitiveplaying field of Electropop (see Lady Gaga) with her debut “Hands”,
but she avoids the bubbly, sickly-sweet approach of late 90s techno,exemplified in DJ Sammy’s “Heaven.”
Add in that Little Boots has been making music since she was five, 
studied music at the University of Leeds and collaborated with mem-
bers of the chiptune outfit Hot Chip and synthpop heroes The Human 
League, and the pop craftsmanship in her music is obvious.The Hilltop Hoods — State of the Art 
����
Selected Tracks: “Chase That Feeling,” “Chris Farley,” “Last Confession”   Hailing from Down Under, the Aussie trio Hilltop Hoods has beenselling out shows throughout their kid-sized continent in support ofthe new album “State of the Art,” but despite the slight “G’day mate”accents, a kangaroo reference and a track built on Men At Work guitar
play, these hipsters sound like something out of Oakland, not The
Outback.
   It’d be easy to say they’re trying too hard, if it didn’t seem so damneffortless.Hank Jr. — 127 Rose Avenue 
��
Selected Tracks:  “Farm Song,” “Red, White & Pink-slip Blues”    He dropped “Williams” from his name and added a little Contemporary Country kick to his newest album “127 Rose Avenue,” but Hank Jr. is still the same old country boy.  
Armed with a sappy croon,Hank ackles the loss of old friends, veteran 
pride, an obligatory tribute to his father and a call out to his Blues 
roots in the title track, featuringa misplaced, Santana-esque lead 
guitar. The album suits a night of drunkenly mourning the world’s 
cruelties to simple folk, but is useful for little else.THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Street Sweeper Social Club — Street Sweeper Social Club 
����
Selected Tracks: “100 Little Curses,” “Clap for the Killers,” “Megablast”   Nearly a year later, former Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello, known for his unorthodox and unearthly shredding style, andBoots Riley of political hip-hop duo The Coup have made a scathing and
entertaining statement with “Street Sweeper Social Club” with lyrics 
like “May your champagne not bubble/ May your pinot be sour/ May that white stuff you snort be 96 percent flour.” Despite Morello’s unimaginative bass lines and Riley’s refusal to rap over complex guitar work, the 2000 breakup of Rage is looking more like an evolution than an ending.

UF junior Tyson Alexander will become his family’s third generation to tee off in the U.S. Open today at 
Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, N.Y. His father, Gators coach Buddy Alexander, will be in the crowd.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
For most, qualifying for the U.S. 
Open is a big deal. But for the Al-
exander family, it’s just another ac-complishment to add to an already impressive golf resume.
Today, UF men’s golfer Tyson 
Alexander will follow in the foot-steps of his father and grandfather as he tees off against the world’s best at the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black.
When the 20-year-old Tyson be-
gins the first hole today at 2:31 p.m., he will continue a streak started by his grandfather Skip Alexander and continued by UF men’s golf coach and Tyson’s father Buddy Alexan-der.
Tyson qualified to be part of the 
156-player field after finishing in sec-ond place at the Orlando qualifier.
“I guess it’s not very common 
for you to see three people follow-ing each other’s footsteps to play in 
three U.S. Opens,” Tyson said.
But it’s more than 
just uncommon: He is 
only the second third-generation golfer 
from the same family 
to play in America’s 
golf national championship.
Heading into the Unknown
Although playing in the U.S. 
Open is a common occurrence for 
the Alexander lineage, they will go into uncharted territory this year.
Neither Buddy nor Tyson has 
played the course at Bethpage Alexander continues 
U.S. Open tradition
One of the biggest factors in 
sports will never show up on a stat sheet.
It plays a role in every major 
sport.
Win without it, and earn praise 
as one of the biggest surprises in 
history.
Fail to win while it is in your fa-
vor, and the second-guessing will 
never cease.
Sometimes it is represented by a 
player. Other times fate plays a key role.
It is why Kobe and the Lakers 
had to win this year. Why Billy D 
had to win when Noah, Brewer, 
Green and Horford came back for another year in Gainesville.
It is often cruel.It is the Window Of Opportunity 
Factor (WOOF).
These opportunities are never 
easy and are often a no-win situa-tion.
The UF men’s basketball team simply lived up to expecta-tions in 2006-07 
when it won its 
second straight title. Failing to repeat would 
have made the 
season bitterly disappoint-
ing. Winning was the equivalent of showing up to work every day: It’s 
expected and you better have a very 
good reason if otherwise.
Imagine putting the WOOF into 
a numerical value. Teams could be 
ranked from 1 to 10.
One would be the equivalent of 
“If you don’t win this year, you’ll 
never win again.”
The best example would be Lar-
ry Bird and Indiana State men’s bas-
ketball program. In 1979, Bird led 
them to the championship game of the NCAA Tournament before fall-Window Of Opportunity Factor 
changes fans’ expectationsBy JESSICA ETTER  
Alligator Writer
Santa Fe College center fielder Keon 
Broxton is opting to take his chances with 
professional baseball and ditching his edu-cation for a shot at the big leagues.  
The freshman was selected in the third 
round of the 2009 MLB Draft on June 9 as the 
95th pick by the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Broxton, who helped propel the Saints 
into postseason play by hitting a three-run, 
walk-off home run in the first round of the 
state championship against St. Pete College 
in early May, was given a $400,000 signing bonus and is currently being represented by former Cincinnati Reds player Reggie Jeffer-son, according to Saints head coach Johnny 
Wiggs.
“It was a tough choice because Santa Fe 
was a great school for me,” Broxton said in 
a phone interview before boarding a plane to Phoenix. “It made it even harder that we 
had a great season this past year.”
Broxton said he hopes to be playing in 
the big leagues within three years but un-
derstands he will be playing in the minors for the near future.
The center fielder, who attended Lake-
land High  with UF athletes such as Chris Rainey and Maurkice and Mike Pouncey, was drafted last season during the 29th 
round but chose to attend college instead of 
heading straight into the major leagues from high school.
“Coming to SFC for a year was definitely 
a profitable decision on his part,” Wiggs 
said. “If he had gone to a four-year school, 
he couldn’t have been drafted (this year). By coming to Santa Fe, he was allowed to be 
drafted this season.”
Broxton, the third junior 
college player drafted this year, is now the highest draft pick in SFC history. 
Previously, the highest 
pick was Ben Kozlowski, who was selected in the 12th round in 1999 by the 
Atlanta Braves.
The other two junior college players 
drafted before Broxton hailed from Chipola 
College and Hillsborough Community Col-
lege. 
Pitcher Patrick Corbin of Chipola was the 
80th pick, and Hillsborough outfielder Evan 
Chambers, Broxton’s former high school 
teammate, was also selected in the third round. 
Broxton said he is heading to Arizona 
this weekend to go through a routine physi-SFC BASEBALLBroxton decides to go proGolf

The closest Tyson has gotten to 
the course is on television.
“I remember watching it in 2002 
when Tiger (Woods) won,” Tyson 
said. “But I don’t think I’ll really be prepared until I actually play some golf on the course.”
While Buddy has not played 
a hole at Bethpage Black, he has walked it, which will allow him to give Tyson some advice.
“I can assure him that the rough 
might be the longest that he’ll ever see and the greens will be the fastest he’s ever seen,” Buddy said.
One thing that is sure to get Ty-
son’s attention is the warning sign that is located just before the first hole. It reads: “The Black Course is an extremely difficult course which we recommend only for highly skilled golfers.”
Bethpage Black, which Golf-
Digest ranks as the sixth-toughest venue in America, is one of the only courses in the world which warns its golfers. 
But if Tyson wants his father’s 
help during his encounter with Bethpage Black, he will have to go into the crowd to do so.
While he has caddied for his son 
before, Buddy decided that this time it would be best if Tyson got a PGA Tour caddy to provide a different outlook on the game.
Tyson agreed with the decision 
and said that it would be good to get somebody who had a lot of experi-ence in the PGA Tour and caddied for a living.
“I’m always going to pick my 
dad’s brain about golf,” Tyson said. “But getting a new perspective on how tour players play will be a huge learning experience for me.”
Star Struck
There might be another learning 
experience in store for the young UF golfer as he plays in the U.S. Open.
While he is accustomed to facing 
opponents from Alabama, LSU and Georgia, in this event he will be rub-bing elbows with the best golfers in the world, including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson.
Tyson knows this tournament 
will be different from all the others.
“It’s definitely not the normal 
golf tournament,” he said. “I’m not warming up with just some normal 
college kids in this one.”
When asked about the chance 
to meet Tiger, Tyson sounded like 
a child who just saw his sports idol 
at the grocery store but was too em-
barrassed to bother him for an auto-
graph.
“I’m not going to go out of my way to meet him,” he said. “He’s on 
a whole other level, so I’m not going to mess with him. But if we do cross paths and we meet, that would be cool.”
Buddy believes that his son is 
mature enough to handle the excite-ment and still focus on the business at hand. 
However, he also wants Tyson to 
enjoy the moment.
“I hope that he is able to take in 
some of the theater and atmosphere that exists at the U.S. Open and en-joys it,” Buddy said.The Right Approach
A great performance would just 
be an added bonus to the many les-sons Tyson will learn over the next four days.
The experience he will gain from 
facing the world’s best in one of the world’s toughest golf courses will prove to be invaluable as he attempts to lead the UF men’s golf team next season as one of the its only seniors.
“The bottom line is that he’s go-
ing to be a better player at the end of the week just because of the expe-rience he is going to gain,” Buddy said.As the tournament nears, Tyson 
is taking the right approach.
“I’m just going in and I’m going 
to try to learn as much as possible,” Tyson said. “I’m going to soak it all in and see what it gives me.”
Tyson’s success in the U.S. Open 
will probably not be able to be mea-sured by a defining moment over the weekend. 
Instead, that moment will come 
in a pressure-packed situation at a future collegiate event. 
When that time comes, the U.S. 
Open will finally have fulfilled its purpose for Tyson.26, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009

The Sycamores have only made two 
more NCAA Tournament appearances since then and have never again made it to the Sweet 16.
Ten, the opposite end of the spec-
trum, would be the equivalent of “There is no possible way you could have won this year, so no one should be letdown more than zero percent.”
Exhibit A: the 2008 Detroit Lions.
Now consider applying the formula 
to some recent UF successes or fail-
ures. 
The 2007 UF volleyball team comes 
to mind with its core group of seniors — setter Angie McGinnis, middle blocker Kisya Killingsworth and hitters Marcie Hampton and Amber McCray — that won four SEC titles but never advanced to a Final Four as well as libe-
ro Elyse Cusack playing great even as a 
sophomore. 
With a national championship as the 
only hole on coach Mary Wise’s ster-
ling resume, the 2007 team didn’t hide 
its hopes of a NCAA title and had a WOOF around 2 or 3. 
But then, sadly, Hampton went 
down with a torn ACL near the end 
of the regular season and UF’s WOOF 
jumped to 6 without one of the coun-try’s best hitters. Sometimes, it’s just not your time.
The upcoming football season poses 
another interesting dilemma. 
While coach Urban Meyer continues 
to stockpile talent in Gainesville, the 
2009 season is shaping up to be an all-
or-nothing affair. 
I’d put the Gators’ WOOF at 3 or 4 
though because they will always have 
a decent grouping of great players, 
even if their names aren’t Tim Tebow or Brandon Spikes.
All I want is a way to measure a usu-
ally intangible feeling.
Fans deserve a way (however subjec-
tive it may be) for a stat sheet to show whether a team was a huge surprise or a terrible disappointment when their 
memory fails them. The 2008 Patriots 
won 11 games but did it without the services of Tom Brady, one of the best quarterbacks in the game. 
The injury changed the Pats’ WOOF 
for 2009 from like a 2 (you almost be-came the best team in NFL history the year before and then only win 11 games?!) to more like a 7 (Who knew 
Matt Cassel would be this good? What 
a pleasant surprise!).
When judging the great teams, how 
much fun would it be to have some sort of quotient on external factors? 
A team’s window of opportunity 
changes the lens through which the season is viewed.
Then again, I don’t wear any glass-

During the Saints’ run at the JUCO 
World Series in late May, Broxton had five doubles, five home runs, 12 RBIs and hit over .500 in the six games SFC played before finishing second in the na-
tion.
“Guys like Keon who are drafted 
high get a lot of opportunity,” Wiggs 
said. “He is a great athlete, and it would not surprise me at all if he is in the big 
leagues one day.”
Throughout his freshman season, 
the 6-foot-3, 19-year-old hit .340 with 
10 home runs, nine doubles, four triples 
and went 12 for 12 in stolen base at-
tempts.
“I think hitting five home runs in 
four days said something to the scouts and showed them my potential,” Brox-
ton said. “Before the postseason, I may 
have been drafted in the 10th or 11th round, but after the JUCO World Series, I’d say my stock bumped up a couple of rounds.”
Broxton is not the only player from the Gainesville area who was drafted.  
LeVon Washington, a 17-year-old 
senior from Gainesville Buchholz High, was picked in the first round by the Tampa Bay Rays.
Washington, also a center fielder, had 
committed to UF prior to the MLB Draft but has since changed his mind. The 6-foot, 170-pounder informed UF head coach Kevin O’Sullivan that he would 
not be attending the university in hopes 
of one day playing at Tropicana Field.
Santa Fe commit Jeffrey Glenn was 
also drafted.  Glenn, 
a senior from Win-
ter Haven High, was selected in the ninth 
round as the 284th pick by the New York Mets. The Saints athletic department did 
not say whether Glenn would opt out of 
attending Santa Fe in the fall.
 “I’m a pro-college kind of guy, but 
when you are drafted in the top three 
to five rounds it is very difficult to turn 
down life-changing money,” Wiggs said. “But when you get that life-changing money like Keon got, you can invest it.”
MLB teams have until Aug. 17 to sign 
picks. If the players do not sign, they are able to return to the draft next year.Buchholz grad picked by Rays

Former San Diego Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf, shown here in a game 
against the Denver Broncos on Nov. 19, 2000, turned himself in on Thursday.
■ THE FORMER NFL QB FACES 
DRUG AND BURGLARY CHARGES IN TEXAS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DALLAS  —  Former NFL quarter-
back Ryan Leaf was in custody Wednes-day in Washington on drug and burglary charges out of Texas after being arrested by customs agents as he returned to the United States from Canada.
James Farren, the district attorney 
in Randall County in West Texas, said Leaf was arrested Wednesday by fed-eral customs agents. Legal assistant Jennifer Bonstein said an extradition hearing was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in Bellingham, Wash., about 
90 miles north of Seattle.
By early Wednesday afternoon, Leaf 
had not been booked into the Whatcom 
County Jail.
Bill Kelly, Leaf’s attorney, said his 
client was returning to Texas to turn himself in by a Thursday deadline.
“I assume when he was crossing 
the border, they picked him up,” Kelly 
said.
The ex-Washington State University 
and San Diego Chargers quarterback is 
charged with burglary to a habitation, a second-degree felony. 
Leaf was also indicted on seven 
counts of obtaining a controlled sub-stance by fraud and one count of deliv-ery of a simulated controlled substance.Leaf taken into custody
The NBA Draft used to be like a holiday 
to me. 
Since I was 7 years old, I’d basi-
cally shut down my life once a year to sit in front of the TV, write down who each team 
picked and remain glued to the TV as the 
analysts either praised or tore into every pick. I’ll likely do the same on June 25, when the 2009 NBA Draft kicks off.
I remember when the Clippers took Dar-
ius Miles out of high school with the third pick and Charles Barkley went off, saying: “They’re a terrible organization. ... I hope he gets out of there. ... The Clippers are one of 
the problems in sports.” 
That was such a great moment of honest, 
unbridled criticism that only the NBA Draft 
could offer.
But as the years have gone by, the NBA 
and NFL drafts have lost their luster. The endless number of mock drafts has taken away the unpredictability of the actual se-lections — unless the Oakland Raiders are 
on the clock, of course.
The weeks — sometimes months — of 
buildup compounded with the insider re-
ports during the draft remove any element of surprise. Honestly, would it kill us if those extra 17 seconds went by without us knowing that the Knicks were going to take Danilo Gallinari? I keep a pretty close eye on breaking news most of the year, but I’d 
much prefer the off-the-cuff remarks and 
genuine reactions.
The element of unintentional comedy is 
still there, fortunately. I never get tired of watching 6-foot-9 athletes uncomfortably stride to the podium wearing their $3,000 suits and $19.99 team hats to shake hands with an old man and awkwardly pose for photos while making meaningless small 
talk with the commissioner.
However, that’s not enough to make up 
for how few surprises remain on draft day. 
As a reporter and follower of sports, I love having a wealth of information available so quickly, so I should love how every media outlet overwhelms its viewers with stats and forecasts about each player and team. We’ve reached the point where a team will 
make its selection, and you can hit “Refresh” 
and get a detailed breakdown of that player and how he will fit in with his new team.
But that’s not what I tune into the drafts 
for. I enjoyed the weeks of uncertainty as op-posed to the reports informing the viewers that players reached agreements with teams a week beforehand. I liked discussing with friends who should go where, not who will 
be going where. What’s wrong with waiting 
until a team actually signs a player to start discussing their eventual impact?Now, half of 
the draft-related conversations I have before the ac-tual event end with 
some variant of, 
“Yeah, but we al-ready know what they’re going to do, so it’s not like any of this matters.” 
In a weird way, 
I still agree with 
the latter half of that sentence. So much of 
a player’s success is dependent on where he 
goes, who his coach is and how well-suited he is for the system he’s put in. Skill and up-side can only take a player so far. 
With the NFL and NBA drafts generally 
no longer what they were, I was left with very few options to fill that hole in my life. The NHL Draft? Uh, sure. If you want un-intentional comedy, you’re all set there. Just 
re-read my description of the players’ walk 
to the podium, only imagine everything with very thick Canadian and Russian ac-cents and unkempt beards.
So that led me to the MLB Draft. In the 
past, I’d check the results a day or two after it was over, but this year, I decided to follow some of the draft on TV and online. 
However, it didn’t quite live up to my ex-
pectations.  The sense of immediacy and im-portance found in the NBA and NFL drafts — a first-round pick in either league comes in with huge expectations — is practically nonexistent in the MLB. 
For that reason alone, I was excited at 
the prospect of Stephen Strasburg, the first overall pick by the Washington Nationals, possibly making the jump straight to the big 
leagues. But Strasburg is a rare exception to 
the rule that draftees must work their way up through the minor leagues before finally finding a spot on an MLB team.
The draftees, including the 22 Gators and 
UF signees taken in the 50-round marathon, still have about two months to decide wheth-er or not they want to either return to school — or go to college at all, in many cases — or 
sign a professional contract.  That’s just not 
exciting to me. Imagine if Percy Harvin had put his name in the NFL Draft pool, been se-lected, then sat around for two months leav-ing everyone pondering his future. 
So I’m still left without a go-to draft. I 
could go the “It’s not you, it’s me” route and say I’ve become too cynical to enjoy them how I used to, or I could just accept the fact 
that they have changed. 
Don’t get me wrong: I’ll still obsessively 
watch all of them. It just won’t be the same.NBA Draft not what it used to be

FARMINGDALE, N.Y. — The U.S. 
Open might have one tough act to fol-
low.
Tiger Woods was pure theater at 
Torrey Pines last year, playing on a left 
leg so badly injured that the U.S. Open 
turned out to be his last event of the year. He made two eagles on the final six holes in primetime Saturday to take the lead, forced a playoff with a 12-foot 
birdie putt on the final hole Sunday, then 
battled Rocco Mediate over 19 holes to 
capture his 14th career major.
“I’m not sure we can duplicate that 
drama,” USGA president Jim Vernon said Wednesday.
Try telling that to thousands of fans 
who trudged through the soggy turf of Bethpage Black for five hours on the final day of practice, all because it was 
their first glimpse of Phil Mickelson.
The New York gallery has always 
loved Lefty, even as he broke their hearts 
with runner-up finishes in the U.S. Open at Bethpage in 2002, Shinnecock Hills in 
2004 and Winged Foot in 2006 with a 
double bogey on the final hole.
The support now is louder and more 
tangible than ever.
Mickelson wasn’t even sure he could 
return to Bethpage Black upon learning last month that his wife, Amy, had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Only after getting some optimistic news that the cancer might have been caught early did Mickelson feel comfortable leaving California in search of a major that has caused him so much grief.
How much he plays the rest of the 
year — Mickelson said the British Open was “unlikely” — depends on what doc-tors find when his wife has surgery two weeks after the U.S. Open.
“I’m putting everything I have into 
this week, because I don’t anticipate be-ing able to play for a little while,” Mick-elson said. “And the fact that my normal support system — Amy and the kids and 
so forth — aren’t going to make the trip 
this week, I’m kind of hoping to feel that support to help me through the week.”28, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009

TAMPA — After a futile attempt to acceler-
ate progress toward a contract extension with the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, linebacker Barrett Ruud is back on the practice field with his teammates.
The fifth-year pro skipped all 14 of the club’s 
voluntary off-season workouts, however he’s par-ticipating in this week’s mandatory minicamp that wraps up the squad’s preparation for the start of training camp on July 31.
“I was hoping to sort of speed things along a 
little bit,” Ruud said of his decision to work out on his own at the University of Nebraska instead of joining the Bucs for Organized Team Activities (OTAs) over the past month.
Ruud is scheduled to earn about $1.6 million in 
the last year of a contract he signed in 2005. He’s led the Bucs in tackles the past two years and is the club’s lone returning starter at linebacker.
“I’d like to be here for a long time. I’ve really 
enjoyed the organization. It’s a first-class organiza-tion and a great community, and I like my team-mates,” Ruud said. “In that respect, I am disap-pointed things haven’t progressed.”
Ruud was non-commital about whether he 
would return for the start of training camp.
“All I can control is what I do on the field right 
now. All I can do is worry about playing as good as I can. I’d like to think everything will take care of itself, but that’s to be seen, I guess,” he said, adding there have been no discussions on an extension.
Meanwhile, he’s catching up on the terminology 
of a new system being installed by defensive coor-
dinator Jim Bates, who has abandoned the Tampa 
Two scheme the Bucs played the past 13 seasons 
under Monte Kiffin.
“I kept in contact with the coaches. I still have 
a pretty good concept of the defense. I’m a little bit behind my teammates ... but I’m happy where I’m at physically. I feel great, I feel explosive, I feel ready,” Ruud said. “I have to kick the conditioning up for July, but I feel good about where I am going into training camp.”Ruud shows

MINNEAPOLIS — During 15 years in 
charge of the Minnesota Timberwolves, 
Kevin McHale forged two distinct reputa-tions.
There was McHale the gifted teacher, 
beloved by players and staff for his relent-lessly positive demeanor and an unending eagerness to share his wealth of basketball knowledge. Then there was McHale the mistake-prone executive, vilified by fans for a series of blunders and the failure to make his team into a consistent champion-ship contender.
New president of basketball operations 
David Kahn dumped McHale as coach on Wednesday, praising him as a “great man” who deserves respect but offered no spe-cific reasons during a press conference for his decision, saying instead that “this is going to be a transition period. And with the changes that have occurred, and with the changes that are still going to come, it would have been difficult to put him in the 
middle of that again.”
McHale, a northern Minnesota native 
and Hall of Fame player who won three 
NBA titles with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, met several times with Kahn before the decision was reached.
“I was willing to come back, but they 
never offered me a contract,” McHale told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. “They told me last night they were going in a different direction. I said, ‘I think you’re making a mistake, but that’s up to you guys.”’
Players lamented the loss of the teacher.“I was more shocked, disappointed, 
hurt,” said forward Al Jefferson, one of many players who urged Kahn to bring McHale back next season. “But at the same time I understand that this is a business.”
Timberwolves forward Mark Madsen 
said McHale will be sorely missed.
“Kevin McHale is a great coach,” Mads-
en said in a phone interview from Salt Lake City. “I’m a little bit surprised by this news and I was hoping to play for him next sea-son and I guess that’s not going to happen now.”
Though he helped turn one of the most 
hapless franchises in professional sports into a playoff team by boldly drafting Kevin Garnett out of high school with the 
fifth pick in 1995, McHale received massive 
criticism from fans the last few years for a series of draft-day failures and other roster moves that never worked out.
After a stirring run to the Western Con-
ference finals in 2004, the Wolves have not made the playoffs since.
McHale showed more proficiency as 
a coach and adored this young team that he helped assemble after trading Gar-nett to Boston in 2007. Timberwolves for-
ward Kevin Love actually leaked word of 
McHale’s departure early Wednesday with a Twitter post that read in part: “Today is a sad day.”
“I don’t want Kevin (Love) to feel badly 
about that,” said Kahn, who added that they won’t start the coaching search until after the June 25 draft. “We live in a very different world than all of us grew up in. I 
don’t think it’s a big deal.”
McHale had been the primary decision-
maker on personnel matters since he was 
named vice president of basketball op-erations in 1995, forging a tight bond with owner Glen Taylor in the process.
“I know that David made a careful 
analysis and this decision was made with the best interests of the Minnesota Timber-
wolves in mind,” Taylor said in a statement 
issued by the team. “I will be forever grate-ful for the work Kevin did in returning to his home state and assembling a team that made eight straight playoff appearances. Kevin brought an enormous amount of bas-ketball talent and passion to our organiza-tion and I wish him nothing but the best.”
Even while in the front office, McHale 
loved to work with players -- often stay-ing late after practice to help post players such as Garnett and Jefferson hone their in-side games. He still enjoyed that aspect last season, though losing wore on him and he wasn’t fond of the rigors of travel.
Though Jefferson lobbied heavily to 
keep McHale, he said he supported Kahn’s decision “100 percent.”
“We have to put Mac out of our heads 
right now,” Jefferson said. “I talked to some of the guys today. In a way, we’re glad it’s over with.”
In 2005, McHale took over as coach after 
firing his old friend Flip Saunders and went 
19-12 the rest of the season.
Taylor moved McHale down from the 
front office again in December to take over 
for fired coach Randy Wittman and hired Kahn last month to take McHale’s former position as president of basketball opera-tions.
Minnesota’s record under McHale after he replaced Wittman was 20-43, but for much of that stretch the Wolves were play-ing short-handed after Jefferson tore the ACL in his right knee. Defensive standout Corey Brewer also suffered a season-ending knee injury and guard Randy Foye missed 12 of the last 22 games due to ankle and hip problems.
Several players remarked about the positive vibe McHale brought to the bench and expressed appreciation of his simpler strategy.
“I believe to my core that Kevin McHale 
has some enormous gifts and is a good human being who cares deeply about his players,” Kahn said. “But I can also believe, at this present time, it was time to make a change.”THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 29

LOS ANGELES — Tens of 
thousands of jubilant Los Ange-
les Lakers fans flooded down-
town Wednesday, creating a tidal 
wave of purple and gold while celebrating the storied franchise’s 15th NBA title with a high-energy 
parade and rally.
People clad in the team col-
ors stood 20 or more deep along 
the 2½-mile parade route from the Staples Center to the packed 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
where players were greeted with a thunderous ovation and show-ered with purple and gold con-
fetti.
After the rally, fans briefly 
danced arm-in-arm as the Ran-
dy Newman song “I Love L.A.” blared over loudspeakers. Some 
had dyed their hair purple for the 
occasion.
“Thank you for all the sup-
port, baby. We love you. Let’s 
go, Lakers,” veteran guard Derek 
Fisher shouted to fans along the parade route.
Fisher all but ripped the heart 
out of the Orlando Magic with a 
pair of 3-point shots that sealed a 
Game 4 victory in the NBA Finals. The Lakers needed just one more game to clinch the championship 
in Orlando on Sunday.
At the Coliseum, which holds 
95,000 people, star Kobe Bryant 
said he was anxious to win even more titles.
“Now here we are, back on 
top, so it just feels unbelievable,” Bryant said, grinning broadly.Fisher and coach Phil Jackson 
also spoke after the Laker Girls 
danced and the players body-
bumped and high-fived on a hardwood floor brought from the  Staples Center, the team’s home 
court.
Bryant led the crowd in a 
championship chant that he said 
he and his teammates shouted before, during and after every 
game this season.
“I want everybody to say ‘ring’ 
on three: One, two, three ...“ he 
shouted.
Crowds at the stadium and along the parade route were ram-bunctious but mostly well-man-
nered, in contrast to the melee 
that broke out downtown after the Lakers clinched the cham-pionship in Florida. Eighteen 
people were arrested during the 
celebration.
Police said there were only 
five arrests on Wednesday. They had no immediate details, but one 
rowdy celebrant was seen being 
led out of the Coliseum in hand-cuffs before the team arrived.
Police Chief William J. Brat-
ton said at least 1,700 officers, some in riot gear and others in 
plainclothes, kept watch on the 
crowd.
The city held similar victory 
parades in 2000, 2001 and 2002 after the Lakers won champion-
ships, but the energy and size of 
the crowd didn’t compare to this year.
“This is more special because 
we went through so many dark years,” Bryant said as he pre-pared to board one of the parade buses. “You can just feel the en-ergy in the city.”
Letitcia Gutierrez watched 
the procession while she was squeezed against a chain-link fence separating fans from the 
double-decker buses carrying the 
players.
“It’s a great thing to be a part 
of,” she said. “We got passion and motivation. We’re rowdy.”
Bryant had teamed with cen-
ter Shaquille O’Neal to lead the Lakers to those three other cham-pionships before a dry spell set in 
after O’Neal was traded in 2004. 
It ended this year, with Bryant, now 30, clearly the leader of this team.
In the days before the event, 
much was made of its estimated $2 million cost, with critics com-plaining that a city a half-billion dollars in debt and facing layoffs 
could not afford the celebration.
But private donors joined the 
team and the owners of the Sta-
ples Center in an unusual move to underwrite most of the cost. 
It was the first of the four Lakers 
victory parades this decade to be privately funded.
People began waiting at the 
Coliseum and along the parade route on Tuesday night. The sta-dium was filled hours before the parade began.
Among those inside for the 
rally was USC football coach Pete Carroll, who has seen his own moments of glory on the Colise-
um’s football field.
“I’m having a blast,” he said.
Walter Contreras was one of 
the thousands of people who ar-rived too late to get into the Coli-seum. He decided to stand out-
side and see whatever he could.
“Come on, it’s the Lakers,” he 
said. “This is the heart of our city.

this?”Lakers parade through Los Angeles as champions30, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 2009

LAUSANNE, Switzerland — 
The four cities bidding for the 
2016 Olympics took their case di-
rectly to the voters on Wednes-
day, stressing the backing of 
their government leaders and 
promising financial security for their multi-billion-dollar proj-ects.
Chicago, Tokyo, Madrid and 
Rio de Janeiro made formal pre-
sentations to members of the In-
ternational Olympic Committee in a crucial meeting before the 
final vote in Copenhagen on Oct. 
2.
“I’m a lucky man not to be 
obliged to vote,” IOC president 
Jacques Rogge said after the pre-
sentations. “It’s going to be a 
very difficult choice for my col-
leagues. I can say very clearly 
the four bid cities are capable of 
hosting superb games.”
The closed-door sessions at 
the Olympic Museum were at-
tended by 93 of the IOC’s 107 members — a strong turnout showing intense interest in what 
shapes up as a tight race between 
candidates from four continents.
At a time of global recession, 
budget plans and financial guar-antees came under extra scrutiny 
in the 45-minute presentations 
and 45-minute question-and-an-swer sessions. Rio even brought 
the head of Brazil’s central bank 
to reinforce its economic mes-sage.
“There was definitely an 
emphasis on financial consider-ations,” Rogge said.
Chicago, seeking to take the 
Summer Games back to the Unit-ed States for the first time since the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, led 
off the proceedings with a six-
member delegation headed by 
bid leader Pat Ryan and Mayor 
Richard M. Daley.
Rogge said Daley confirmed 
he would sign the Olympic host city contract if Chicago gets the Olympics, requiring the city to take full financial responsibility for the games. Chicago had pre-viously raised concerns about 
some of the guarantees required 
in the standard contract.
“The mayor has clearly indi-
cated that he would sign the host 
city contract,” Rogge said. “We 
have only one host city contract. There is no amendment to the host city contract from the IOC.”
Chicago showed a video fea-
turing Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to President Barack 
Obama, in which she reiterated 
the chief executive’s support for the bid. She highlighted Tues-
day’s announcement that Obama 
is forming a White House Office of Olympic, Paralympic and 
Youth Sport.
Bid officials hope that Obama 
— a former Illinois senator from Chicago — will travel to Copen-
hagen for the IOC vote.
Jarrett’s appearance “is re-
flecting the president’s commit-ment,” Ryan said. “I thought she expressed the president’s thoughts extremely well.”
Asked why Obama himself 
did not appear in Wednesday’s 
video, Chicago venues and oper-
ations director Doug Arnot said 
the IOC had asked the cities not 
to use “celebrities and dignitar-ies” in the presentations.
“To be a good partner you 
have to follow instructions, so we did so,” he said.
That didn’t stop Tokyo and 
Madrid from showing videos of the Japanese and Spanish prime ministers and Rio from screen-
ing a message from the Brazilian 
president.
As with all U.S. bids, the 
Olympics in Chicago would not be underwritten by the federal government. Bid leaders told the 
IOC they have their own secure 
public-private guarantees.
“The city of Chicago has put 
up guarantees of $500 million and the state of Illinois has leg-islation for $250 million,” Ryan said. “We are very comfortable 
that we can bring from the pri-
vate sector additional resources 
that will take the guarantees up 
to the $2 billion range.”
Three members of the group 
“No Games Chicago,” which ar-gues the Games are bad for cit-ies financially and can displace 
thousands of people, set up a 
stand and distributed documents opposing the bid.
Mario Pescante, a senior Ital-
ian member on the IOC executive board, said the Chicago presen-
tation was a step above previous 
U.S. bids.
“I have seen lots of presenta-
tions by American cities over the years,” he said. “This time it was different. They were more ac-
cessible and low-profile. It was 
important to stress the sports issues. In the past, it was more 
Hollywood style.”OLYMPIC GAMESChicago makes push for 2016 bid

SANTO DOMINGO, Do-
minican Republic — Pedro 
Martinez could be back on a major-league mound soon.
The right-hander said on 
Wednesday that he has had talks with the Chicago Cubs and Tampa Bay Rays and hopes to sign a contract in the near future.
“There’s a good chance I’ll 
be signing soon, but there still isn’t anything firm,” Marti-
nez told The Associated Press.
Martinez, 
37, has been training in his native Dominican R e p u b l i c 
in hopes of 
returning to the majors. His four-year deal with the New 
York Mets ended after last 
season.
“Chicago and Tampa Bay 
are the two teams that have 
shown the most interest, and 
we are negotiating with them, 
although I’ve told my agent 
not to call me until it’s a done 
deal,” he said.
Martinez wants to sign 
with the team that has the best chance of winning a pennant.
“I need the emotion of 
competition,” he said.
Martinez has a 214-99 re-
cord with an ERA of 2.91 in 17 major-league seasons.Pedro
