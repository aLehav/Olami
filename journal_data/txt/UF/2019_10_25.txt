MORALLOWEENALLIGATOR INVESTIGATES
ANDREW LOTTO 
ALLOWED TO RESIGN, 
WAS NOT FIRED 
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
Editor’s Note: This investigation 
is part of a series of stories on 
sexual violence at UF. The following 
allegations are from a UF Title IX 
investigation. A second story on 
this investigation will be released 
soon.
A UF professor in the Department 
of Speech, Language and Hearing 
Sciences was allowed to resign in 
May instead of being ﬁ  red — but 
not before he allegedly assaulted or 
had inappropriate relationships with 
multiple women, some of whom 
were his students.
UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Title IX Compli-
ance conducted an investigation that 
found Andrew Lotto, 51, touched 
several women in ways that made 
them uncomfortable since he started 
teaching at UF in 2016. Students and 
faculty alleged in the investigation 
that Lotto was in a romantic rela-tionship with one 
of his students, 
was caught in the 
midst of a sexual 
act with a student 
in his ofﬁ  ce, and 
pushed an under-
graduate against 
the wall and 
stuck his ﬁ  nger in 
her ear, among other incidents.
Title IX is a federal civil rights 
law that bans discrimination based 
on gender or sex and manages cases 
of sexual harassment.
Lotto told The Alligator he didn’t 
ﬁ  ght the allegations because he 
was planning on retiring soon. He 
said his concern was primarily for 
his students who were pulled into 
the investigation and left without a 
mentor.
“I saw how much my students 
were suffering being brought back 
into this, being interviewed over and 
over,” he said. 
Conversations about sexual vio-
lence, misconduct and protective 
measures have come to light on 
campus this semester. Three days 
ago, the 2019 AAU Campus Climate 
Survey on Sexual Assault and Mis-conduct found that at UF, almost one 
in three undergraduate women and 
about 8 percent of men experienced 
nonconsensual sexual contact this 
year.
But not every case of sexual as-
sault or harassment is between stu-
dents. 
“Lotto’s relationships seem kind 
of cultish,” a student said in the 
Title IX investigation. “Minds have 
been manipulated and women have 
been cut off with no other systems 
of support — other than him. They 
are pitted against each other and in 
competition for Andrew’s attention.” 
Cheryl Betz, the author of the in-
vestigation, directed The Alligator to 
UF spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
“We take these matters very se-
riously and we strongly encourage 
anyone who has experienced sexual 
harassment to report it immediately 
so that the university can take ap-
propriate action,” Orlando wrote in 
a statement. 
Lotto was placed on paid admin-
istrative leave on March 11, 2019, 
due to the serious allegations and 
then resigned from his position on 
May 23, the investigation reports.
The 149-page investigation spanned from September 2018 to 
May 2019 and featured interviews 
with 20 witnesses of at least eight 
incidents of inappropriate behavior.
Almost every name is redacted 
from the report in accordance with 
a Florida statute that bans univer-
sities from releasing identifying in-
formation of a person who ﬁ  led a 
complaint or a witness in a sexual 
harassment investigation. 
‘DID I GO TOO FAR?’: A 
LOOK INTO SOME OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS
The earliest recorded incident 
happened on Dec. 9, 2016, at a 
house party hosted by a UF faculty 
member who would later become 
the ﬁ  rst person to report Lotto for 
inappropriate behavior, according 
to investigation records.
The host said Lotto entered her 
daughter’s room, lay on her bed 
and began to ask questions about 
the male friend she was speaking to 
online.
The daughter, whose age is not 
mentioned in the report, conﬁ  rmed 
the incident in an investigation in-
terview, saying he reeked of alcohol 
and asked, “Who’s more important for you to talk to — him or me?” 
and “What does he have that I don’t 
have?” 
He later asked her to change 
into a onesie and then picked her 
up, swung her from side to side 
and whispered, “I love it when you 
wear your ‘onesies’!” in her ear, the 
daughter told investigators.
The investigation included 43 
pages of text screenshots between 
Lotto and the daughter. Some of the 
texts discussed topics such as Na-
tional Chocolate Chip Cookie Day 
and pumpkin carving, but in others, 
Lotto asked to see a picture of her in 
a dress and said he was hanging out 
with 16-year-olds at Busch Gardens. 
“Did I go too far tonight?” he 
texted after the party. 
“I’ll let you decide that,” the 
daughter responded. 
Lotto told The Alligator he had 
known the daughter since she was 
ﬁ  ve. According to the investigation, 
he frequently celebrated holidays at 
the initial reporter’s house. He said 
he walked into the daughter’s room 
at the party after the mother told 
him to go get her.

ANNUAL FUNDRAISING 
PUSH-DAY RAISED 
$652,946 
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
Dance Marathon’s sixth an-
nual Transform Today beat its 
$650,000 goal by $2,946.26.
The total was revealed at 
Moralloween, Dance Mara-
thon’s Halloween-themed 
event where miracle families, 
families whose children have 
life-threatening diseases or ill-
nesses, participate in events 
like a fashion show, a haunted 
house and trick-or-treating 
Wednesday.
Moralloween is the largest 
event hosted by DM besides 
the actual marathon in March, 
when students dance for 26.2 
hours while fundraising, said 
Morgan Hill, UF DM market-
ing manager. About 50 mira-cle children and their families 
attended wearing superhero 
and princess costumes. 
“So blessed that our orga-
nization was able to raise this 
much and give it all to Shands 
right down the street,” said 
Hill, who has been involved 
with DM for six years. “For 
me, the smiles of the children 
is really what just keeps this 
organization going.”
DM’s morale team organiz-
es Moralloween each year on 
Flavet Field where organiza-
tions set up tables or a trick-or-
treat booth that are in theme 
with their miracle child’s in-
terests, said Anna Fitzpatrick, 
assistant director of fundrais-
ing for DM’s morale team. The 
team also creates themes and 
activities in March. 
“We’re really lucky this 
year that it fell right after 
Transform Today so we could Transform Today raises $600kSEE LOTTO,  PAGE 6

Students of all cultures are 
united by one thing: coffee. 
As Student Government’s mul-
ticultural affairs cabinet director, 
Robyn Louis said she wanted to 
hear from students about what 
UF and SG could do better. So 
she hosted a “culture and coffee” 
event. 
“We’re Top 7, and I want our 
students’ cultural experience to 
be top 7 as well,” Louis said. 
The multicultural cabinet held 
the event Thursday morning in 
the Reitz Union. Bagels, pastries 
and coffee were provided for about 20 people. Food and deco-
rations for the event cost about 
$150, Louis said. 
The event began with guest 
speaker PJ Jones, assistant direc-
tor of UF Multicultural & Diver-
sity Affairs, who said one of the 
main reasons the MCDA exists is 
because students across the coun-
try constantly experience acts of 
insensitivity, bias and hate on 
college campuses.
“We want to make sure that 
doesn’t happen here at the Uni-
versity of Florida,” Jones said.
Jones said it is important to 
discuss and celebrate cultures and 
identities to promote inclusion and diversity. She also encour-
aged engaging in conversations 
that may make people uncom-
fortable, like people wearing hi-
jabs, gender-neutral restrooms or 
people speaking in their native 
language.  
“It’s important for us to also 
note that there are so many things 
that students are literally just 
craving — craving connection, 
craving support,” Jones said. 
“What we’d truly like to do is 
make spaces where people truly 
feel like they belong.”
After Jones’ speech, Louis ini-
tiated discussion. She asked what 
students thought about the up-coming openings of the Institute 
of Black Culture and Institute of 
Hispanic-Latino Cultures, and 
how they felt about Asian Paciﬁ  c 
Islander American Affairs and the 
LGBTQ+ community not having 
houses. One student was sur-
prised APIA did not have a house, 
considering its student popula-
tion size.
Louis also asked students what 
UF could do to become more ra-
cially and culturally inclusive 
beyond the MCDA and having a 
multicultural cabinet. Students 
voiced concern about the amount 
of people who don’t know the 
MCDA exists because they feel like its presence isn’t known.
Yalanda Nicolas, a UF 18-year-
old architecture freshman, 
learned about the event through 
on-campus ﬂ  yers. As a Haitian 
student, she recognized a lot of 
time and effort is being put in to 
make sure UF’s diverse student 
population feels safe and con-
nected to their cultures. 
She said a key part in improv-
ing UF’s diverse population is 
hiring more diverse staff who stu-
dents can relate to.
“The people who are on this 
campus, I think they want to see 
change, so the diverse group we 
have are go-getter leaders,” Nico-
las said.

No work experience required!STUDENTS DISCUSS LGBTQ+ 
EDUCATION,  EVENT IDEA S
By Melissa Hernandez

Alligator Contributing Writer
Drag queens. Sex toys. LGBTQ+ 
representation. Sexual education. 
These are some ideas UF students 
suggested during Tuesday’s Pride 
Awareness Month town hall in the 
Reitz Union. The town hall, which 
was attended by about 40 students, 
was one of two the organization will host in advance of the celebra-
tion, which is mid-March to mid-
April, said Karla Gonzalez, UF Pride 
Awareness Month president.
New ideas for Pride Awareness 
Month include organizing a ball, as-
sembling goodie bags for homeless 
shelters and bringing transgender 
people of color to campus to share 
their experiences. 
“We want more community in-
volvement to have a stronger com-
munity base,” said Gonzalez, a 
21-year-old health education and 
behavior senior who identifies as bi-
sexual.Gonzalez said the organization’s 
crown jewel is their annual drag 
show, which typically features “Ru-
Paul’s Drag Race” contestants. Staff 
also discussed other events includ-
ing Paint Your Orgasm, Queer Prom, 
a gay blood drive and a kinky sex 
panel where there will be a sex toy 
giveaway.
Emmely Pavila, Pride Aware-
ness Month marketing director, said 
while drag shows are fun, educa-
tional panels are just as necessary. 
During the town hall, attendees 
said they wanted Pride Awareness 
Month to stand up for queer people, promote intersectionality and ensure 
that queer voices are being heard in 
the Gainesville and UF communities.
“We need safe spaces that cel-
ebrate and represent the commu-
nity,” said Pavila, a 22-year-old UF 
psychology and sociology senior. 
In the last year, Pavila said she 
has become more comfortable with 
identifying as gay, and she feels saf-
est at LGBTQ+ community-specific 
events like the town hall.
Veronica Sandoval, a 19-year-old 
computer science sophomore who 
is bisexual, is on Pride Awareness 
Month’s internal affairs and educa-tion board. She said she has been 
involved with activism in the LG-
BTQ+ community since joining an 
LGBTQ+ club in high school. 
She said events such as Pride 
Awareness Month are important 
because they can help LGBTQ+ 
members feel more comfortable and 
educate allies on how to support the 
community. 
“LGBTQ history is important,” 
Sandoval said. “Our country needs 
to focus on sexuality education more 
than sex ed.”
VENUE WOULD BE AT 
CELEBRATION POINTE  
By Lina Ruiz 
Alligator Staff Writer
A presentation to the county 
commission Oct. 15 about a pos-
sible Sports Events Center at Cel-
ebration Pointe has sparked more 
questions than answers between 
city and county officials.
The facility, which would host 
sporting events such as basketball 
and volleyball tournaments, would 
be paid for with bed tax dollars, 
which comes from tourist revenue, 
said county spokesperson Mark 
Sexton. 
Mayor Lauren Poe sent a letter 
Tuesday to County Chair Charles 
Chestnut IV voicing concern about 
the possible redevelopment project, 
asking the county to reconsider the 
proposal. Poe also wrote the City Commis-
sion thought the two parties agreed 
to focus on inequities between East 
and West Gainesville. 
“Diverting additional economic 
advantages to the West side will 
only add to the already burgeoning 
disparity, as well as urban sprawl,” 
Poe wrote in the letter. 
Chestnut replied the same day 
with a letter stating the possible 
benefits of the Sports Events Center 
such as “a 30-year impact of $1.2 
billion economic output” and more 
than 1,000 annual jobs. 
He also mentioned the county’s 
contribution to redevelopment in 
East Gainesville through the recent 
unification of Gainesville’s four 
Community Redevelopment Dis-
tricts into one.
“This consolidation will make 
$70 million in funding available 
for transformational projects such 
as the Eighth and Waldo project,” 
Chestnut wrote. Sexton said the county was con-
fused by the city’s reaction at the 
Oct. 17 joint meeting, as the facility 
would not be paid through CRA-
allocated funds. 
“I don’t know if it was a collec-
tive amnesia or what kind of re-
ports they were getting, but it’s as 
though those conversations [about 
funding] had never happened,” he 
told The Alligator
City Commissioner David Arreo-
la said the board agreed to send the 
letter because building the Sports 
Events Center would be “breaking 
a promise to East Gainesville.” 
“It’s not too late to turn back,” 
Arreola said. “It’s not too late for 
them to change their mind, come 
back to the table and work with 
what they originally promised.”

DeSantis gave the effort 
in Florida a political 
boost Thursday when 
he appeared with a bi-
partisan group of law-
makers and two former 
star football players 
from Florida State Uni-
versity.
“When I look for 
good policy ideas, Cali-
fornia is usually not the 
first place I look. But I 
think California is on 
the right track,” said 
DeSantis, a Republi-
can.
A proposal by state 
House Democratic 
Leader Kionne McGhee 
is modeled after one 
signed into law last 
month by California 
Gov. Gavin Newsom 
that allows college athletes in the Golden 
State to sign endorse-
ment deals and hire 
agents without endan-
gering scholarships 
and their eligibility to 
participate in NCAA-
sanctioned sports.
Florida has more 
than 11,000 student 
athletes, many who 
play sports that might 
not get the same lime-
light as football and 
basketball but never-
theless achieve acclaim 
in their own sport, ac-
cording to Rep. Chip 
LaMarca, a Republican 
who has introduced his 
own proposal. His leg-
islation, if approved, 
would go into effect as 
soon as next summer 
and may include finan-
cial literacy education.Pride Awareness Month hosts town hall to prepare for next year
Sports Events Center plan creates confusion Florida may pay college athletes between the two of us. There was 
nothing about it that seemed odd,” 
he said. “I’m very disappointed to 
hear that that was used against me.”
But not every incident happened 
at a party — one took place in Lot-
to’s ofﬁ  ce. 
In June 2018, the case’s initial 
reporter said she saw a student ly-
ing on the couch in his ofﬁ  ce. Lotto 
was leaning over her torso with the 
lights off, according to records. He 
stumbled and fell back when he saw 
her at the door and moved his hands 
toward his crotch like he was zip-
ping his pants or buckling his belt, 
the reporter told investigators. 
Lotto said the student just had a 
migraine and was resting in his of-
ﬁ  ce while he sat on the edge of the 
couch. 
Another incident took place at a 
February conference on Amelia Is-
land in Nassau County, Florida. 
A faculty member attended a so-
cial mixer on the ﬁ  rst night of the 
conference where Lotto approached 
her, took her hand and started sway-
ing before inviting her to come into 
the hot tub with him and several 
other women, she said in the inves-
tigation. 
The faculty member chuckled 
and said she hadn’t brought a bath-
ing suit, but Lotto allegedly sug-
gested she climb in naked because it 
was what he and other women were 
planning to do, according to investi-
gation records.
The faculty member said she 
started to walk away and Lotto called 
after her: “Don’t go! Don’t go!” 
She left anyway. 
Lotto didn’t deny every aspect of 
this interaction.
“She said, ‘I didn’t bring a swim-
ming suit,’ and I said, ‘Apparently,  
it might be optional at this point,’ be-
cause of stuff that was going on. I ac-
tually didn’t end up going in the hot 
tub. I wasn’t a part of any of these 
things,” he told The Alligator. 
But the faculty member was still 
surprised by his actions, she said in 
the investigation. 
“I was ﬂ  oored that he was al-
lowed to be around. I’ve heard ru-
mors that he has actually had sexual relationships with his grad students. 
I know it’s just rumors, but I just 
have to get it off my chest that I think 
it might be true,” she wrote in an 
email to David Fuller, a professor in 
the Department of Physical Therapy 
at UF. 
And according to the investiga-
tion records, she may be right. 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH 
STUDENTS AND FACULTY
UF conducted an IT forensics 
exam on Lotto’s computers and oth-
er devices in 2019 and found emails 
between him and a student that “evi-
denced a romantic/intimate relation-
ship between the two,” the investi-
gation said. 
The student wrote him poems 
over email. One had three parts 
with more than 30 stanzas about a 
beast-slaying prince and a princess 
locked in a dungeon. A second poem 
begged him to send her his photo 
and biography for a website. 
“You are a heavyweight of academic 
glory
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your instincts might say you 
should just ignore me
You’re the reason that I just can’t 
concentrate,” one stanza from the 
second poem reads.   
“LOVE this poem. Please ﬁ  nish it. 
I have read it over and over in the 
current darkness,” Lotto replied. 
Other messages detailed how 
much the two missed each other. 
The student said she felt like they 
were on separate continents and 
Lotto agreed, saying they needed 
to ﬁ  nd a more secure way to speak 
with each other. 
“I need more and better interac-
tion with you. I am hopeful. I miss 
it,” he wrote. 
“I am empty,” she responded. 
Other students seemed to be 
drawn to Lotto as well. Out of the 
20 comments on Lotto’s webpage 
for Rate My Professor, a site where 
students can leave comments about 
professors and rate their performanc-
es, seven mention his looks. 
Every commenter wrote about 
his classes at the University of Ari-
zona, where he taught before com-ing to UF. 
“I admit I took this close [class] 
solely based on the ‘hot professor’ 
comments here. And it is true. One 
girl in front of me even blogged a 
steamy note about him in the begin-
ning of class once,” one user wrote. 
“Nice guy, and VERY easy on the 
eyes,” another wrote. 
But some students and faculty 
supported Lotto in ways that weren’t 
sexual or romantic. 
Five people testiﬁ  ed in Lotto’s 
favor during the investigation. One 
student said Lotto was like her fam-
ily and that “when he comforts me, 
it’s with words, not touching — he 
is very professional.” Another stu-
dent said she considered him a great 
resource and support system in the 
department. 
However, the author of the in-
vestigation wrote she didn’t ﬁ  nd the 
witnesses credible given their close 
relationships with Lotto. 
Ianessa Humbert, former associ-
ate professor in the Department of 
Speech, Language and Hearing Sci-
ences, used to work with Lotto be-
fore she left to teach at the University 
of Iowa. 
She told The Alligator he was en-
ergetic, outgoing and always willing 
to support students and faculty. 
“The way things work at UF is 
if you are accused of something 
you might as well just be guilty,” 
she said. “I know that their [the re-
porters’] opinions are completely 
skewed.” 
Kathy Carbonell, a former UF as-
sistant research professor and Lot-
to’s ex-wife, said the allegations are 
“a gross mischaracterization of who 
he actually is.” 
Carbonell ﬁ  rst met Lotto at the 
University of Arizona in the early 
2000s when she was his student. 
They married in 2013 and decided to 
separate last month for reasons unre-
lated to the case, she said. 
“He treats his students more like 
family than he does employees,” she 
said. “He is not some kind of sexual 
predator.” 
THE ANONYMOUS 
LETTERS
There were no interviews be-
tween November 2018 and March 2019. The investigation report did 
not explain the gap, but a wave of 
anonymous letters from students 
and faculty about Lotto’s behavior 
kick-started the interviews again.  
Michael Perri, dean of the College 
of Public Health and Health Profes-
sions, was forwarded an email by an 
unknown person on Feb. 21, 2019. 
The letter claims one of Lotto’s stu-
dents “basically lived at his house 
over the last six months” and that 
the two were sleeping together. 
From March 6 through March 13, 
four additional anonymous letters 
were slipped under the ofﬁ  ce doors 
of Perri and Fuller. 
Fuller declined to comment and 
Perri directed The Alligator to the UF 
spokesperson. 
One author of an anonymous let-
ter said Lotto touched their backside, 
pulled them close and began to use 
sexually explicit language. Five days later, another anonymous letter de-
tailed how Lotto ground his pelvis 
against the writer’s backside during 
a party, even when she pulled away 
from him several times. 
“I don’t even like walking down 
the hall past his open ofﬁ  ce door,” 
she wrote. “I have seen this same 
type of inappropriate behavior with 
other students on other occasions 
and feel it will continue to happen.” 
According to investigation re-
cords, another person wrote Lotto 
had created an environment so hos-
tile that several students had mental 
breakdowns, and a woman who got 
very drunk at one of Lotto’s parties 
had started to take her clothes off.
“Dr. Lotto’s behaviors towards 
female students are fundamentally 
demeaning, disrespectful and at the 
core predatorial,” she wrote in the 
letter. “It appears that every new 
crop of students is a new fresh batch 
for him to conquer.” 
She added she felt the need to be 
anonymous because “like many oth-
ers, I am extremely fearful of retribu-
tion.” 
Lotto was told not to contact stu-
dents after being placed on adminis-
trative leave in March 2019 and told 
investigators he upheld this rule, but 
a surveillance investigation found 
a student visited his house at least 
twice during his leave.
He told The Alligator a visit oc-
curred because a doctoral student 
about to graduate asked to have a 
celebratory brunch at his house. 
However, surveillance found a stu-
dent’s car at his house at 8 p.m. and 
afterward on April 21 and April 24, 
according to the investigation. 
On May 24, Perri sent Lotto a let-
ter saying he had accepted his volun-
tary resignation in lieu of being ﬁ  red. 
“I’ve been an academic since I 
was young. I’ve never even taken a 
vacation. So I’m going to be a retired 
person for a while.” he told The Al-
ligator.

you can’t help but feel a bit uncom-
fortable. 
You see large spiderwebs overtak-
ing certain areas of the coffee shop, 
as if they’ve been there for a long time. Look-
ing closer, you can see a thick layer of dust 
collecting on the tables and chairs as well.
The shop’s cracked beams don’t ease your 
worries — the building looks like it could col-
lapse at any moment. 
The waitress ﬁ  nally comes back with a 
large tray of pastries and drinks. Her expres-
sion doesn’t reveal much, but she seems to 
focus her emerald eyes on you.
You quickly look down so you don’t have 
to keep making eye contact. As you look up 
to grab your drink, you see the waitress look 
back at you before disappearing behind the 
counter. 
This eye contact is occurring way too 
often, you decide. It’s time to drown your 
awkwardness in coffee. 
You take a big swig of your drink, and 
then immediately spit it out.
Your friends all look at you in complete 
disbelief, and you look down in shock as well. 
Splattered across the table you see...
Darts & Laurels
It’s nearly Halloween, and too many 
things are ruining this spooky season.
We’re supposed to be afraid of fic-
tional monsters, not real ones.
Warren Hurst, Sevier County Com-
missioner of Tennessee, is one of these monsters. He’s not a scary person by any 
means, but his views, on the other hand, 
are pretty horrifying. He recently made a 
homophobic statement against Pete Butti-
gieg, an openly gay Democratic candidate 
for the presidency, saying that having 
a “queer” running for President is ugly. 
He also decided to attack black people 
and individuals with low incomes, stat-
ing that more focus goes to these groups 
instead of the rights of white people.
Not only are we giving him a dart for 
being homophobic, but he also deserves 
one for basically saying white male privi-
lege doesn’t exist anymore. The fact that 
he can remain this ignorant clearly says 
otherwise.
It turns out you can also be horrible 
without saying anything, and the Brazil-
ian government is doing just that. 
Since September, the beaches of Brazil 
have been plagued with oil spills of 
unknown origins. Instead of properly ad-
dressing the issue, the Brazilian govern-
ment decided to do nothing  — except 
send 5,000 troops to stop people from 
protesting about it.
A laurel goes to the volunteers for 
their tireless work cleaning up the sludge 
that has been plaguing their beaches — 
preserving the habitats of the animals 
that depend on them. 
A dart goes to the Brazilian govern-
ment for ignoring this problem while also 
preventing people from doing more to fix 
it.
Lately, the protection of wildlife seems 
to be more of a priority, as it should be. The U.S. House has recently made animal 
cruelty a federal felony.
We have to give the House a laurel
for advancing animal rights. Now it just 
needs to control the animals breaking the 
law within it.
Other people are breaking the law as 
well but in a more positive way. Protes-
tors in Lebanon are 
dropping beats against 
the government, and 
they deserve the final 
laurel for enacting change in a creative way with their incor-
poration of the viral “Baby Shark” song 
into the protest.
The world needs more people like the 
ones in Lebanon and Brazil — or at least 
fewer people that make their actions 
necessary.

Florida’s soccer team has made a habit 
of coming from behind to win games.
It did just that on Oct. 13 against Ken-
tucky and last Friday against Auburn, eras-
ing one-goal deficits in both fixtures to earn 
crucial conference victories ahead of the 
upcoming SEC Tournament.
The No. 20 Gators tried to mount anoth-
er comeback on Thursday night, but Ten-
nessee held them scoreless in a 1-0 triumph 
at the Regal Soccer Stadium in Knoxville, 
Tennessee.
The Volunteers (9-5-2, 3-4-1 SEC) 
looked more like the 20th-ranked team in 
the nation than the Gators (10-6, 6-2 SEC) 
did in the early stages of the game. Tennes-
see kept a majority of the possession and 
created several scoring opportunities, but 
Florida goalkeeper Susi Espinoza was there 
to keep the hosts off the scoreboard.
Espinoza saved midfielder Sonia 
Ouchene Salón’s header that was destined 
for the back of the net in the sixth minute.
Florida had a difficult time breaking Staff Report  
The Gators must be feeling pretty 
“cocky” (I’m sorry) after their win 
over South Carolina. The team sur-
vived the wind and rain from Tropi-
cal Storm Nestor, and so did the al-
ligatorSports football writers.
After walking from the stadium 
to the car — a nearly quarter-mile 
journey — we were all thoroughly 
soaked for the five-hour car ride back 
to Gainesville.
Georgia is up next for UF, but both 
teams have a bye Saturday prior to 
that game.
We intend to use our weekend off 
from traveling to catch up on school-
work, hit the town and actually 
watch more than one college football 
game for once.
The Gators may not be playing, 
but there are still lots of games for 
our “experts” to weigh in on. Foot-
ball writers Sam Campisano and Kyle 
Wood debate the most intriguing 
matchup of the week: No. 9 Auburn 
at No. 2 LSU.
Auburn will win because…  
Auburn’s ineptitude in Baton 
Rouge is so famous that there’s even 
a curse for it. 
After upsetting LSU on the road in 
1999, Auburn coach Tommy Tuber-
ville handed out cigars to his players 
on the field. That was the last time 
AU won at LSU. The Cigar Curse was 
born.
What makes this year’s Tigers 
team different? 
Bo Nix.
(I’m talking about the War Eagle 
Tigers, by the way)
Auburn’s freshman quarterback 
is legit. The AU offense is legit, too, 
averaging the third-most points per 
game in the SEC. LSU’s defense, on 
the other hand? Not so legit. 
To be fair, No. 6 in the conference 
isn’t terrible, but it’s not exactly be-
fitting of the No. 2 team in the na-
tion. It’s something Nix will take ad-
vantage of, shocking the world in the 
process. Smoke on that, LSU. 
— Sam Campisano
LSU (-11.5) will win because…
I’ve been to Death Valley. It was 
very loud. I saw Auburn quarterback 
Bo Nix play in a hostile environment

ley was louder than The Swamp.

College basketball season 
is now just a couple weeks 
away, and many teams, in-
cluding the Gators, are pre-
paring for exhibition games. 
These contests help squads 
gauge where they’re at as a 
team and focus on areas that 
need to be improved before 
the regular season gets un-
derway.
Florida’s exhibition takes 
place Tuesday at 7 p.m. at 
the O’Connell Center, where 
the Gators will match up 
with the Lynn University 
Fighting Knights. Between 
now and then, UF coach 
Mike White is hoping to 
get healthier following a 
closed scrimmage over the 
weekend and show more 
consistency in practice after 
one on Tuesday that White 
dubbed “horrendous”.
 
Gators on target from 
three during scrimmage
 Florida ran with the Bulls on Saturday at the 
O’Connell Center, defeating 
USF in a closed preseason 
scrimmage, 76-58.
Kerry Blackshear Jr. had 
17 points, draining four 
from beyond the arc. The 
Gators, as a group, shot well 
from three, going 13 for 24 
as six different UF players 
made at least one trey.
“We really shot the ball 
well,” White said during 
Thursday’s media availabili-
ty. “That was pleasing. That 
was probably the biggest 
surprise out of the (scrim-
mage).”
Although White was 
happy with the shot percent-
age, he made it known that 
they aren’t going to neces-
sarily make shots at such 
a high clip like that every 
game.
“You’re hoping that your 
guys would understand that 
we can’t expect to shoot 
the ball that well…I like the 
way that we shared the ball, 
a lot of extra passes, but 
you can’t expect to shoot 50-something percent on the 
season.”
 
Florida battling injury as 
regular season approach-
es
 UF has a lot of talent but 
not as much depth, and a 
few injuries here and there 
can certainly make a huge 
impact on a team that has 
just 11 eligible scholarship 
players for the 2019-20 sea-
son.
The team was handed 
a massive blow a couple 
weeks ago with the an-
nouncement of Gorjok 
Gak’s shoulder injury that’ll 
keep him out indefinitely, 
and on Thursday, White 
shared some additional in-
jury news.
“Dontay (Bassett)’s been 
out,” White said. “We’re 
hoping it’s a minor knee, 
hoping it’s just a bruise…
Ques Glover is a little 
banged up with a finger is-
sue as well.”UF faces preseason injuries

MEN’S TENNISBy Brendan Farrell
Sports Writer 
The Gators volleyball team 
enters this weekend on a roll. 
Florida has won 13 of its last 14 
matches, with its only loss com-
ing to No. 16 Kentucky on the 
road. 
The Gators (15-3, 6-1 SEC) 
are in third place in the SEC and 
half a game behind Kentucky 
and Georgia, which are both 7-1. 
Florida has the opportunity to 
improve its SEC record with two 
matches this weekend against 
teams in the bottom half of the 
SEC standings.
“A win’s always great,” mid-
dle blocker Rachael Kramer said. 
“But to have your team trending 
in the right direction, that’s what 
we’re really more excited about.”
Coach Mary Wise’s squad 
will face eighth-place Alabama 
Friday night and 10th-place Ten-
nessee on Sunday. Here is what 
you need to know about them:Alabama
When: Friday at 7 p.m.
It’s been a tough start for 
Alabama in conference play. The 
Crimson Tide (11-7, 3-4 SEC) has 
lost three of its last four matches. 
Its only win during that stretch 
was Mississippi State, which still 
has yet to win an SEC match. 
That’s generally how the 
season has gone so far, as well. 
Alabama has dominated the bot-
tom of the conference with wins 
against the bottom-three teams 
in the SEC.
But Alabama has struggled 
mightily against the difﬁ  cult 
parts of its schedule. It has only 
played two other ranked teams 
and was swept by both. The 
Tide also played Georgia, which 
received 12 votes in this week’s 
rankings and was also swept. 
The Crimson Tide’s biggest 
issue is its offense. Alabama sits 
10th in the SEC in hitting per-
centage at .211. That is a major 
advantage for a Gators defense 
that’s ranked second in the SEC 
in opponent hitting percentage (.170). 
Alabama enjoys spreading 
the ball around; six players have 
at least 180 attacks this season. 
However, three of those six play-
ers are hitting below .200. 
That being said, freshman 
Alyiah Wells is a player to 
keep an eye on in this match. 
The middle blocker is fourth in 
blocks per set (1.08) and seventh 
in the conference in hitting per-
centage (.342).
The battle between Wells and 
Florida’s tandem of Kramer and 
sophomore Lauren Dooley will 
be an intriguing one to watch. 
Tennessee
When: Sunday at 1 p.m.
Football fans in Knoxville 
looking for an escape haven’t 
been successful with the volley-
ball team, considering that both 
are 10th in the SEC. 
The Volunteers (9-9, 3-5 SEC) 
have also lost three of their last 
four following consecutive losses 
to Kentucky at home and No. 25 
Missouri on the road. However, Tennessee has had 
a tough schedule so far in con-
ference play. The Vols will have 
already played the top six teams 
in the SEC after playing Florida 
on Sunday. 
They have also given the top 
teams in the SEC a ﬁ  ght in most 
of their matches. Tennessee was 
swept by Kentucky, but it had a 
couple of close calls against Ole 
Miss and Georgia. 
Tennessee has a decent of-
fense as well, ranking sixth 
in the SEC in hitting percent-
age (.243). Outside hitter Tessa 
Grubbs leads the team with 284 
kills, and her 4.06 kills per set is 
fourth in the SEC. 
Defensively, the Volunteers 
have some holes. Tennessee has 
the third-worst opponent hitting 
percentage in the conference 
and is ninth in blocks per set. 
However, right side hitter Alyssa 
Andreno is seventh in the SEC in 
blocks per set (1.04).

The Florida men’s tennis team 
will feature eight different Gators this 
weekend at the Ring Tennis Complex 
for the ITA Southeast Regional Cham-
pionships. 
Gainesville will host close to 100 ten-
nis players from 15 different schools, 
as spots to compete in the ITA National 
Fall Championships in Newport Beach, 
California, are on the line. The eight 
Gators competing this weekend are 
Johannes Ingildsen, Andy Andrade, 
Duarte Vale, Josh Goodger, Brian Ber-
dusco, Lukas Greif, Greysen Cacciatore 
and Blaise Bicknell. Among those who 
competed on Thursday was sophomore 
Cacciatore. The Gainesville-native en-
tered the tournament on a four-match 
win streak after claiming the Singles B 
title at the Bedford Cup.
Despite starting hot and extend-
ing his win streak to ﬁ  ve after defeat-ing Mercer’s Carver Arant, Cacciatore 
couldn’t outlast Florida Gulf Coast’s 
Feliksas Sakalauskas and failed to qual-
ify for the main draw. After receiving 
a ﬁ  rst-round bye, the sophomore had 
no trouble defeating Arant in straight 
sets to advance to the ﬁ  nal qualifying 
round. Cacciatore took the early advan-
tage against Sakalauskas, winning the 
ﬁ  rst set 6-4, but wouldn’t take another 
set for the rest of the match, losing his 
chances of competing with his fellow 
Gators in the main draw.
Cacciatore was eliminated from 
singles play, but he remains alive in 
doubles, playing in the main draw 
alongside freshman Bicknell. The other 
seven Gators will see their ﬁ  rst action 
on their home court starting Friday 
morning.

White also mentioned that guard Andrew 
Nembhard has missed some time battling 
tendinitis.
If some of these minor injuries linger for 
a longer period of time, UF’s freshmen, espe-
cially the ones down low in Omar Payne and 
Jason Jitoboh, will get some extended playing 
time.
“You’d like to see them play like sopho-
mores,” White said, referring to his freshmen 
low-post players with Gak and Bassett bat-
tling injury. “But unfortunately they have no 
idea what’s about to hit them.”
Florida’s team culture healthy earlyThe execution of a team’s performance on 
the court a lot of times relies on a team’s to-
getherness off of it, and this group of Florida 
players continues to impress White in that 
aspect.
With nine new faces on a 14-man roster, 
you’d assume there’d be some gaps in cama-
raderie, but so far that hasn’t been the case.
“We’ve got some strong personalities, 
and I think that’s a good thing,” White said. 
“These guys are really close, especially for 
this early on with this many new guys, it’s 
actually been pretty surprising.”
To be the Final Four-caliber team that 
many believe they are, the sixth-ranked 
Gators will need to continue to grow on and 
off the court heading into Tuesday and be-
yond.

pand upon my reasoning as 
to why the LSU Tigers will 
beat the Auburn Tigers in 
the most tiger-heavy con-
ference in football.
LSU quarterback Joe 
Burrow, the Heisman front-
runner, leads the second-
highest scoring offense in 
the FBS and the Tigers have 
an average victory margin 
of just over 30 points.
Both Tigers defenses 
are very similar, with both 
teams allowing almost 
the exact same number of 
yards per game, but LSU 
yields three more points 
per game. The difference is Auburn can’t score with 
LSU, and its defense isn’t 
quite good enough to lim-
it Burrow, receivers Jus-
tin Jefferson and Ja’Marr 
Chase and running back 
Clyde Edwards-Helaire.
Auburn hasn’t won in 
Baton Rouge since 1999. 
It’ll have to wait until at 
least 2021 to put an end to 
that streak.
LSU will score its third 
quality win of the season 
and head into its matchup 
against Alabama, which 
holds SEC title game im-
plications, fresh off a win 
over the Crimson Tide’s 
biggest rival.
— Kyle WoodNow onto the picks…
Tied for ﬁ  rst at 43-20 
is Kyle “Driver’s Ed Can 
Screw Off” Wood, who 
nearly missed his exit and 
decided to park it in the 
median and wait for trafﬁ  c 
to clear. We made it to Co-
lumbia in one piece, Kyle, 
but I’m pretty sure that 
type of driving behavior 
is frowned upon. I’m just 
glad Florida Highway Pa-
trol didn’t put a stop to our 
journey before it even had 
a chance to begin.
Read the rest online at 
www.alligator.org/sportsthrough the heart of Tennessee’s de-
fense, so it relied on forward Kit Loferski 
for a spark on offense.
Loferski has done most of her damage 
from the ﬂ  anks this season, which was 
evident in the 31st minute. The redshirt 
junior used her speed to get behind UT’s 
back line and whip in a cross to forward 
Kouri Peace, who was wide open in front 
of goal. Peace, however, shanked the 
kick, and both teams went into halftime 
tied 0-0.
The Volunteers started the second 
half in the same fashion as the ﬁ  rst, but 
this time they capitalized on their supe-
rior play.
Forward MA Vignola pounced on a 
loose ball at the top of the box and found 
midﬁ  elder Katie Cousins, who calmly 
placed her shot in the bottom-right cor-
ner to give Tennessee the 1-0 lead in the 
51st minute.UT was close to its second goal eight 
minutes later, as Vignola’s left-footed 
shot hit the post. The Gators spent the 
rest of the game looking for an equal-
izer, but Volunteers goalkeeper Lindsey 
Romig stood tall in net.
Romig ﬁ  nished the match with seven 
saves, her second-highest mark of the 
season.
Things went from bad to worse for 
UF in the 81st minute when Loferski was 
shown a straight red card for dissent.
Loferski stormed off the pitch and 
went straight to the locker room. She 
was joined by the rest of her team nine 
minutes later, as the Gators suffered 
their sixth loss of the season.
