Coast Guard got no SOS from 2 missing NFL players
TAMPA (AP) — The Coast Guard says it has narrowed the search area 
for two NFL players and another man whose overturned boat was found 
off the Florida Gulf Coast. Coast Guard Capt. Timothy Close says the search area is "substantially smaller," based on where they found the boat and a survivor. Searchers previously covered 16,000 square miles.
Nick Schuyler was clinging to the boat about 35 miles off Clearwater. 
The former USF player told rescuers that the boat was anchored when it flipped Saturday evening in rough seas. He says the others aboard got separated from the boat. The boat belongs to Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper. He, defensive lineman Corey Smith and former South Florida player William Bleakley remained missing.John Lockett / Alligator
Zach Braff, actor, writer and director, thanks the audience after be-
ing interviewed by UF Master Lecturer Mike Foley at the Phillips Cen-ter for the Performing Arts Monday night.

Actor and film director Zach Braff ran 
onto the stage with a Red Bull clutched 
in his left hand Monday night, greeting 
the crowd and pointing to his butt be-
fore planting it in a cushy armchair.
Braff, perhaps best known for his 
role on the long-running TV series 
“Scrubs,” entertained a crowd of about 
1,700 people in the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts.
Brought by Jewish Awareness 
Month and Accent, Student Govern-ment’s Speakers Bureau, Braff, was in-terviewed by journalism master lecturer Mike Foley about his career, childhood and recent adventure to Israel  about six 
months ago.
“I love Israel,” he said. “I don’t think 
it’s just a Jew thing. The truth is it’s an 
amazing place. All the major religions started there.”
Braff, 33, who is the youngest of four 
children, said he first discovered his love for acting from a constant child-hood desire to show off .
“I wanted to make my family laugh,” 
he said. “I was pretty much as gay as you can be without being attracted to men. I love the theater, and I love mu-
sic.”
In his first TV spot he starred in a 
CBS special called “My Summer as a 
Girl,” where he dressed in drag.
“I was a horrible looking woman,” 
he said.
It was still some time before he 
was able to land the role of Dr. John “J.D.” Dorian on what-was-then NBC’s 
“Scrubs.”‘Scrubs’ star speaks at UF

The fat will hit the fire today in Tallahassee as state 
lawmakers convene in the capitol for the start of the 
spring legislative session.
The impending budget cuts that have probably 
plagued the dreams of lawmakers and administrators alike will finally begin to take shape, but UF still won’t know the size of its cut until the end of the session.
The state is facing a budget deficit that could be as 
high as $5 billion, according to projec-tions.
On top of that, with cash so tight this 
year, UF was asked by the state and the Board of Governors, which oversees Flor-
ida’s 11 public universities, not to submit a state bud-get request seeking funding for specific projects and programs like it typically does, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Instead, UF has issued a list of six broad budget pri-
orities.
The priorities include passing the tuition bill that 
would allow universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent a year until they reach the national average, minimizing budget cuts, and securing more funding for the College of Medicine and for construction proj-ects around campus.
UF also launched its Gators for Higher Education 
Web site, gatorsforhighered.ufl.edu, on Wednesday that explains the legislative priorities and asks UF’s faculty, staff, students, alumni and supporters to lobby their legislators.Legislators to

Despite possible future dips in state fund-
ing, UF has received a $21 million donation 
from a Jacksonville couple for medical edu-cation purposes and facilities.  
Jerry and Judy Davis, both cancer survi-
vors, have given a record $20 million to UF’s College of Medicine to create the Jerry W. and Judith S. Davis Cancer Endowment.  
“We have excellent physicians at UF,” 
said Jerry Davis, who was a patient at the UF Shands Cancer Center. “We want to do all we can to support them.”
According to Dr. Joseph Simone, director 
of UF’s Shands Cancer Center, the endow-ment will be used to recruit top doctors and researchers to the university. It will also help in developing programs to learn more about specific cancers, such as lymphoma and breast cancer.
“They’re extremely generous people,” Si-
mone said of the Davises. “They have strong feelings about cancer and want to help elim-inate or control the disease.”  
The Davises gave an additional $1 mil-
lion to the construction of the  $388-million Shands at UF Cancer Hospital, according to Kim Rose, Shands  spokeswoman.                                         Rose said the project is on budget, and 
the hospital is still scheduled to open in No-vember 2009. 
According to the hospital’s Web site, the 
building will be 500,000 square feet with 192 private inpatient beds and a critical-care center for emergency and trauma services.

Two UF students robbed
In separate crimes, two UF 
students were pushed down 
and robbed late Friday night 
and early Saturday morning.
At 11 p.m., a female student 
was walking in the parking lot of Royal Village Apartments, 710 S.W. Depot Ave., when a 
black man pushed her to the 
ground and stole her purse, said Gainesville Police Department 
spokesman Mike Schibuola.
He said although the K-9 unit 
was not able to track the man down, they found the woman’s 
purse a few blocks away with all of its items missing.
There was a second mug-
ging at about 2 a.m. Sunday.
In the University Park Stu-
dios apartment complex, 1222 N.W. Eighth Ave., a white man pushed a female UF student 
onto the ground and stole her 
purse, Schibuola said.
The man then got into the 
passenger side of a light blue or teal vehicle that police think may be a Ford Ranger, he said.
“Right now, we don’t know 
if these crimes are related.” Schibuola said. “Although 
the suspect descriptions don’t 
match up, the patterns of the crimes are very similar.”

Obama releases secret 
Bush anti-terror memos
WASHINGTON (AP) — The 
Obama administration threw 
open the curtain on years of 
Bush-era secrets Monday, re-
vealing anti-terror memos that 
claimed exceptional search-and-seizure powers and di-
vulging that the CIA destroyed 
nearly 100 videotapes of inter-rogations and other treatment 
of terror suspects.
The Justice Department 
released nine legal opinions showing that, following the 
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Bush administration de-
termined that certain constitu-
tional rights would not apply during the coming fight. Within 
two weeks, government law-
yers were already discussing ways to wiretap U.S. conversa-tions without warrants.
The Bush administration 
eventually abandoned many of the legal conclusions, but the 
documents themselves had been 
closely held. By releasing them, President Barack Obama con-
tinued a house-cleaning of the 
previous administration’s most contentious policies.
“Too often over the past de-
cade, the fight against terrorism has been viewed as a zero-sum 
battle with our civil liberties,” 
Attorney General Eric Holder said in a speech a few hours 
before the documents were re-
leased. “Not only is that school of thought misguided, I fear that in 
actuality it does more harm than 
good.”
The Obama administration 
also acknowledged in court documents Monday that the CIA destroyed 92 videos involv-
ing terror suspects, including 
interrogations — far more than had been known. Congressional 
Democrats and other critics have 
charged that some of the harsh in-terrogation techniques amounted 
to torture, a contention President 
George W. Bush and other Bush officials rejected.
The new administration 
pledged on Monday to begin turning over documents related 
to the videos to a federal judge 
and to make as much informa-tion public as possible.
The legal memos written by 
the Bush administration’s Office of Legal Counsel show a gov-
ernment grappling with how to 
wage war on terrorism in a fast-changing world.
The conclusion, reiterated in 
page after page of documents, was that the president had broad 
authority to set aside constitu-
tional rights.
Fourth Amendment protec-
tions against unwarranted search and seizure, for instance, did not apply in the United States as long 
as the president was combatting 
terrorism, the Justice Department said in an Oct. 23, 2001, memo.
“First Amendment speech and 
press rights may also be subordi-nated to the overriding need to 
wage war successfully,” Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General John Yoo wrote, adding later: “The 
current campaign against terror-
ism may require even broader exercises of federal power do-
mestically.”

� FESTIVAL INCLUDES MORE THAN 
140 BANDS.

The Harsh Reality
Take a drive in any direction of Alachua 
County, and it may be a shock. 
Out in Alachua’s blueberry fields, Plant 
City’s strawberry patches or the Immokalee 
tomato fields, hundreds of migrant workers, 
men and women, struggle each day to pro-
vide food and a future for themselves and their children.
“It’s always a good time to see what’s be-
hind the curtain on how food gets to our ta-bles,” said Ryan Murphy, director of the Har-vest of Hope Fest.
The three-day festival is a fundraiser for the 
Harvest of Hope Foundation, a nonprofit or-
ganization in Gainesville that provides finan-
cial aid to migrant workers and their families throughout the country.
During his UF graduate program, Murphy 
spent two years with the foundation. Through a program called Libros de Familia, Murphy met with migrant workers and helped them with their English-speaking skills. The grassroots music festival will feature 
four stages, turning out local and national rock bands such as Against Me!, The National, Bad Brains and Girl Talk.
The St. Johns County Fairgrounds’ 38-acre 
grassy pasture will be flooded with local ven-dors, artisans and people who just want to contribute.
“People just started donating what they can 
to cut our costs,” Murphy said. “Local grow-ers are providing catering, some are donating amps for the stages and others are screening T-shirts for festival volunteers.”
And with a carbon-neutral program, so-
lar generators and reasonably priced tickets, Murphy said, the festival is as forward think-ing as they come.
Gouge-Free Zone
On one Saturday afternoon, Ed Kellerman, 
a UF lecturer and communications director of the foundation, strapped a candy-apple red motorcycle helmet to his head and sped over to United Church of Gainesville to meet his 
brother, Phil, at the Holistic Health Fair.
Under the front overhang, Phil sat by a 
pullout table stacked with shiny metallic one-
pound Sweetwater Coffee bags — a weekly sales endeavor to make a few extra dollars for the foundation with the help of the local Gainesville growers. The Kellermans emphasized the impor-
tance of buying local products for the festival 
and especially at home. 
“My wife goes to the farmers market each 
week,” said Phil, president of the foundation. 
“If you don’t care for your community, don’t blame me when it all dries up.” 
Ed said the festival, which boasts more 
than 140 bands, will allow musicians to get more exposure, publicity to get more business and prices to be reasonable for concert-goers.
At $19.50 for a single-day pass and $39.50 
for the three-day weekend, he said they’re not duping anyone. 
They call it the “gouge-free zone.” Primitive camping passes for three-day pa-
trons are only an extra $29.50 for four people. Ticket sales increase $10 on the weekend of the event.  
Prices are low because hundreds  volun-
teered to work at the festival, and dozens of local organic vendors will donate food for the bands. 
Many vendors don’t have big budgets for 
advertising or the ability to reach out beyond their stores. 
“Since we’re a grassroots organization, we 
can use help wherever we find it,” Ed said. “It’s a win-win for all of us.”
And through a UF course in nonprofit 
leadership and management, about 10 stu-dents will assist Ed at the festival to fulfill their 
public service requirements. 
Gainesville’s No Idea Records, the same 
people behind The Fest last fall, began gather-
ing bands in November and headed a massive promotional campaign for the benefit with Southern Lovin’ PR and Mutiny PR. 
After the foundation received a $50,000 
grant from the St. Johns Tourist Development Council to promote and market the festival,
Murphy signed a three-year contract with 
the fairgrounds. If all goes well, the organiza-tion  may see a few years of stable funds for migrant families.
“Migrant farmers work extremely hard for 
our well-being,” Murphy said. “It’s the least we can do.”

Ofelia Schutte’s uncle was on his death-
bed in Cuba in 2006, but a U.S. law prohib-
ited her from being there for him.
Cuban-Americans like Schutte may 
have more opportunities to visit family 
under a new U.S. House of Representa-tives bill that passed Wednesday. 
If the wide-range spending bill becomes 
a law, it will extend the list of family mem-bers who Cuban-Americans are allowed to visit in Cuba, and it will allow them to 
visit once a year for an unlimited period. It 
will also permit them to spend up to $170 per day on travel expenses.
Under the current policy put in place 
by former President George W. Bush in 
2004, Cuban-Americans can visit family 
every three years for up to 14 days per visit. They can spend up to $50 per day on travel expenses.
If the propopsed bill becomes makes it 
past the Senate, Cuban-Americans could visit aunts, uncles and first cousins in ad-dition to those they are currently allowed to visit — parents, grandparents, grand-
children, siblings, spouses and children. 
The House bill, H.R. 1105, passed with 
a vote of 245-178. 
 The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote 
on the bill today, and President Barack Obama, who has been a proponent of eas-
ing restrictions with Cuba, will make the final decision.
Carlos Frias, UF alumnus and author of the memoir about his visit to Cuba entitled 
“Take Me with You,” said the proposed 
bill would allow the Cuban-Americans of this generation to know their roots.
“For the people who want and need to 
see their close family, it really is a humani-tarian measure,” he said.
However, for Frias, visiting Cuba came 
with mixed emotions.
Frias was nervous to approach his fa-
ther about a work assignment he had just received in Cuba. This was because his father, who had been jailed by Fidel Cas-tro’s government for political activism, 
strongly opposed the idea of returning to 
the country. 
“For me and I think for many Cuban-
Americans of my generation, there’s still an ideological barrier,” Frias said.
“I carry the history of my parents who 
saw and endured terrible things. That may not be how Cuba treated me, but it’s how Cuba treated them,” he said.
Andrew Ruiz, president of the Cuban-
American Student Association at UF, said a lot of members have visited their fami-lies in Cuba. 
He has never been to the country, but 
he would like to see where his parents and grandparents grew up.
However, his family doesn’t want him 
to visit, he said. 
His grandfather told him it would be “a 
slap in the face to them” to return while the Castros are in power.  
Carmen Diana Deere, director of the 
Center for Latin American Studies at UF and an expert on Cuba, said travel restric-
tions were imposed when the trade em-
bargo was placed on Cuba’s government  under Fidel Castro in the 1960s. 
The American government didn’t want 
visitors from the U.S. helping the Cuban economy. 
“That’s the rationale, but it hasn’t 
worked,” she said.  
Instead, it slowed down the rate of eco-
nomic growth in the U.S. and made trade more difficult. 
“(The bill) is certainly positive because 
the previous regulations were so restric-tive that, in my opinion, it was ridiculous,” 
she said.
Ofelia Schutte, who was born in Cuba 
and has lived in the U.S. for almost 50 
years, said that when Bush passed restric-
tions, “(it) was a huge violation of human 
rights.”
Schutte has second cousins in Cuba. Her 
immediate family died or left the country over the years, she said. 
It’s important to her to see her family, 
not just communicate with them through e-mail, she said.
“It is often underrated how important 
it is to be able to hug a person or touch a person or be physically present with them when you care about them,” she said.
UF freshman Shirley Rodriguez and 
her mom, Maria Elena Crespo, agreed that there is a need to spend time with the about 120 family members they have in Cuba.
Rodriguez and Crespo were born in 
Cuba and have lived in the U.S. for about 13 years.
Crespo and Rodriguez have visited 
Cuba together three times since they left.
Rodriguez said they wanted to go more 
often, but they couldn’t under law.
They visited in 2006, so they couldn’t 
return for the next two years to visit Cre-spo’s mother, who has thyroid cancer.  
“Those three years felt like we were be-
ing punished for something that wasn’t even our fault, so it’s a relief to know that we are being released of a burden,” Rodri-
guez said.
Rodriguez would also make use of the 
unlimited trip time that is being proposed, 
she said.
If the legislation passes, she hopes to 
soon visit Cuba for about a month and spend time with her newborn cousin. 
“Honestly, there’s no point going for 14 
days because you’re spending $2,000 (on 
travel costs),” she said.  
Crespo said she plans to go twice a year 
if the proposed law passes.
“We cannot change anything political, 
but we have our family,” Crespo said.New House bill expands guidelines for visiting CubaSpeciAL RepORT

Bring It On
Members of the Kappa Delta Sorority cheerleading team practice 
their routine Monday afternoon for the Bring It On cheerleading competition.
At age 26, he auditioned for 
the show twice before receiv-
ing a call back, which brought 
on six more auditions in front 
of various NBC executives, a process which he compared 
to competing in an Olympic 
event.
“It doesn’t matter if you nail 
the part the third time, because 
if you bomb it the fourth time 
there is nothing you can do,” 
he said.
Braff admitted the long, 
stressful process eventually paid off. In becoming the star 
in a hit TV show, he also had 
“ultimate freedom,” a term he referred to when describing the cast’s input in the show.
“There are so many jobs 
where you’re not free to be cre-ative,” he said, adding he was also blessed to be cast in a com-patible group of a sane people.
Braff credited the show’s hi-
larity to creator Bill Lawrence’s love of improvisation.
“We’d do a scene as written 
and then just mess around,” he 
said.
During his interview, Braff 
took a special lik-ing to the man 
who was signing for the hearing 
impaired on stage. 
He would periodically 
ask him to sign inappropriate words like “shit,” “foreskin” and “titties.”
“It would be so much fun to 
hang out and in your daily life 
have someone sign everything 
you say,” he said.
Braff spoke on other in-
terests he’s pursued, outside of  acting, such as obtaining his pilot’s license and direct-ing. He won a Grammy for his compilation soundtrack in the film “Garden State.” 
“That poor Grammy has got-
ten more evil eyes from mu-sicians,” he said, and said he 
knows little about music be-
sides what he likes and doesn’t 
like.
During the audience ques-
tion-and-answer portion, the majority of women confessed 
their love for Braff, one even asked for a hug — in response, 
Braff left the stage to meet her 
in the aisle.
Most male audience mem-

Bill Edmonds, spokesman for the Board of 
Governors, said all 11 state universities were 
asked this year not to submit budget requests that included proposals for university-specific 
issues. 
This year is the first time since 2004, when 
the board was created and first implemented the current budget request policy, that they 
were asked not to do so, Edmonds said.
That doesn’t mean the board, which usually 
bundles the requests into one large request for the entire State University System, isn’t asking 
the state for money this year.
The board is seeking an op-
erating budget for 2009-2010 of almost $3.2 billion, accord-
ing to the board’s request. 
Last year’s operating budget was just over $3 billion. 
Sikes said UF understands 
that lawmakers have a tough task before them.
“We’re hoping for the best,” she said. “We 
are trying to mitigate budget cuts. That’s our number one priority.”Board of Gov. seeks $3.2B from state
ficials see the donation as a “trans-formational” gift that will help the university affirm its role in the world as a top clinical and research center for cancer.“Support from alumni and 
friends of UF is always important in terms of UF’s reputation, re-search abilities and ability to help society, but it is even more impor-tant in these tough economic times of declining state support,” Robell wrote in an e-mail. Jerry Davis, a UF alumnus, and 
his wife, Judy, are recurring do-nors.
They have given $3 million 
to the College of Journalism and Communications in the past, as well as  $5 million toward UF’s Shands Cancer Center in 1998. As survivors, Jerry said cancer 
research is very important to him and his wife and that giving to the Shands at UF Cancer Hospital is “a good investment for all cancer patients.”   
UF Foundation spokesman 
Chris Brazda said UF is doing well for the times in terms of dona-tions. 
Brazda said UF has met 57 per-
cent of its goal for  the university’s fundraising effort, the Florida Tomorrow capital campaign. UF hopes to collect $1.5 billion by the year 2012.
The donation will help fund the new 500,000-square-foot Shands Cancer HospitalbrAff , from page 1

CIA should be held          
accountable for cover-up
Street Smarts
In Philadelphia’s promi-
nent South Street corridor, the economic downturn 
has brought resurgence of one word rarely spoken these 
days — opportunity.
With countless empty 
storefronts lining one of the 
city’s major tourist destina-tions, a group of business owners have come together to offer heavily discounted work space to artists.
Called “Arts on South,” 
the initiative provides musi-cians, painters and others the chance to feature their work in a location they normally could not afford. Combining exposure for the artists with making the neighborhood more visually appealing, the project only requires that the 
new tenants cover the cost of 
utilities.
Nothing like Philly chan-
neling its inner Wal-Mart by rolling back rent prices to the days of yesteryear.
According to the Associat-
ed Press, leases will be signed for two months of free rent and can be renewed month-to-month until a paying rent-er can be found. If artists are forced to give up their space, 
they will be provided with a 
new one.
Facing both the economic 
crunch and a construction project that drove down pe-destrian traffic, the city has demonstrated a willingness to do whatever it takes to inspire a renaissance on South Street.
The Editorial Board is quite 
impressed with Philadelphia’s efforts to improve its city while also providing a huge break for budding artists. As abandoned buildings and storefronts currently create an eyesore around our town, we implore the city of Gainesville 
to take note of the progress 
being made up north.
With all of the talented mu-
sicians and painters that call Gainesville home, a chance for a resurgence in North Central Florida may be but a rent-free initiative away.The word out of Washington reveals new information surrounding the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes that feature two al-Qaida suspects.
While the length of the tapes had already been made known, 
federal prosecutors announced Monday that a total of 92 video 
tapes were destroyed in November 2005. What makes the situ-
ation raise eyebrows is the fact that the interrogations of Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashir, which were recorded on the destroyed tapes, were deemed harsh at a time when Congress questioned tactics used in the CIA’s interrogation and detention program.
Hmm, smells like a cover-up.According to an article in The New York Times, the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the agency for 
violation of the Freedom of Information Act. In submitting doc-
uments at a New York City court, the ACLU wants the judge in the case to hold the CIA in contempt for destroying the tapes.
Finally, the chance for a major federal agency to be held ac-
countable for its questionable actions.
The Editorial Board can’t help but wonder why Jose A. Ro-
driguez Jr., head of the agency’s clandestine service, authorized the destruction of the tapes in question. What was wrong with keeping the footage secure in a safe in Thailand until the U.S. 
government could properly declare that the CIA was not guilty 
of employing suspicious interrogation tactics? By destroying the tapes at such a seemingly opportune time to avoid potential backlash, the CIA has cast a cloud of suspicion over itself that cannot go away without further investigation.
Sure, the CIA is granted a bit of leeway when it comes to se-
crecy, but not at the expense of America conveying to the world an abiding acceptance of torture.
The sap is rising on campuses nationwide, as evi-
denced by “brahsome” plans of impending de-bauchery and the giggly expectation of blackouts 
yet to be wistfully forgotten. 
The month of March is upon us. As spring peeks out 
from the freezing blasts of an unusually cold winter, few signs point as clearly to the shifting seasons as the hallowed traditions of college spring break.  
The State Department, though, wants you to keep 
your sloppy seconds and unfair fights out of the Mexi-can resort towns that have perfected the art of shame-
lessly catering to college spring breakers. An alert sent 
out Feb. 20 by the U.S. government warns of a height-ened danger for revelers making the boozy trek to Mex-
ico this year.   
Our neighbors to the south have been experiencing 
a bit of an issue controlling violence among drug gangs 
recently, with over a thousand killings reported so far this year. The gangs are by far the most powerful entity 
in Mexican society now, especially along border towns 
vital to the smuggling trade.   
However, no college kids really party in Ciudad 
Juarez — if Señor Frog somehow wound up there, he wouldn’t last fifteen minutes before catching a bullet to 
the back of his amphibious head. The travel warning 
makes clear that the greatest danger is concentrated in 
these northern regions, but the timing of the govern-ment-issued notice speaks directly to college kids mak-ing final travel plans for coastal areas still considered 
much safer destinations.
College presidents are chiming in too, with the Uni-
versity of Arizona directly “urging” students to stay 
away from Mexico alongside less dire warnings from universities scattered from Colorado to Pennsylvania. The compound effect is a broad 
coalition of authority figures wag-ging a massive finger in the faces of scores of affluent would-be 
tourists.
Keeping spring breakers inside 
American borders keeps their 
money in our economy and out of the Mexican economy, a dou-
ble blow to our neighbor nation 
struggling mightily with funding the front lines of our 
drug wars.
The American government has not been on the best 
of terms with the Mexican political structure for quite 
a while now; this unease culminated in the murky saga 
of the two border patrol agents paroled by former Pres-
ident George W. Bush in the waning moments of his 
power.
A travel alert may be simply about the safety of 
American citizens, but it could also be a pointed attack on the one aspect of the Mexican economy that provid-
ed vital dollars to a nation on the verge of a massive 
civil war.
Equating the relative safety of resort areas protected 
by Mexican authorities directly to the urban epicenters 
of gang warfare is akin to comparing a trip to South 
Beach with an afternoon in Liberty City. Spring break-ers are not going to “exercise caution in unfamiliar ar-eas and be aware of their surroundings at all times,” 
whether in Cancun or Clearwater. 
So keep those plans to go to Cozumel — just pack a 
.44-caliber Magnum alongside that box of Magnums.

Letters to the Editor
Public education should be a priority
This weekend I went to a rally organized 
by the Florida Education Association, Flor-
ida’s largest educators’ union, in support of full and sustainable funded public education in our state. 
The thousands of teachers, parents, PTA 
members, education support personnel and students in attendance were united in their message: Together, we can stop education budget cuts. 
Yes, these are lean times we’re experienc-
ing, a fact Florida educators know better than most. 
That’s because Florida, already nearly 
last among the states in per-capita education spending, stands as one of only three states that have actually decreased education fund-ing the in last several years. Here at UF, we’ve felt the effects through across-the-board cuts, lost faculty, and now, targeted cuts directed at the Colleges of Education and Nursing.
It’s time for us to stand up and tell our leg-
islators to make public education a priority.
We’re kicking off our campaign on campus 
with a candlelight vigil mourning the loss of 
funding for public education this Wednesday 
at 7:30 p.m., outside of Norman Hall. 
From there, interested advocates and activ-
ists can tap into a campaign that will finally secure adequate funding for public education into the indefinite future.

4LSCollege should be an option for all
I want to commend the work the United 
We Dream at UF Campaign has done in the past week. I believe the Development, Re-lief and Education for Alien Minors Act (the DREAM Act) is of great importance because 
it will resolve the tragic irony that occurs in 
America.  
Many people are unaware that every year, 
at least 65,000 undocumented students are de-nied acceptance into colleges they would have otherwise been accepted into because of their immigration status.
It does not matter that they were taught 
the same American values and all about the 
American dream just like the rest of us. It 
doesn’t even matter that they call America home and have learned to speak English and excel in school.
It only matters that they were brought to 
America by their parents when they were minors and therefore lack the neccesary legal documents.
The irony is that these kids are taught to 
pursue their dreams, wishing to attain a pros-perous future. Then they get slapped in the 
face and are told that their years of hard work 
are not enough to get them into college, not even in America.
So let us all support the United We Dream 
at UF Campaign and help make the dreams of thousands come true.

My gym partner and I have 
been pretty consistent this semester, and as lift-
ing heavy weights is only a passing distraction for me, I take almost ev-
ery opportunity I can get to people 
watch. I’ve noticed a disturbing trend: A divide exists between male and female gym-goers. 
It’s an interesting little experi-
ment in social interaction — Jane Goodall can have her gorillas.
On the male side of the room, 
sometimes there’s not much differ-
ence anyway.  
There are two halves to the room: 
one female, and one good. There are 
few crossings between the two sides, except on limited occasions. Girls usually intermingle to work on their legs, which doesn’t usually anger the men, who are mostly working on upper body. A few daring spirits 
try dumbbells, usually ranging from 
2.5 pounds to 12, maybe. Under no circumstances is a woman to use the bench. This is unwritten law; it just looks silly. I once saw three girls pumping iron on one bench. Not only did the tomboy in question need two spotters, there couldn’t be more than 60 there to begin with 
and there was much simpering over 
breaking a nail.
Likewise, few men venture into 
the forest of treadmills, oscillation devices and Stairmasters that popu-late the female half of the room. The medicine balls are stacked near the yoga mats and exercise balls, where any female is free to demonstrate 
her flexibility.
They even have banks of tele-
visions provided for them, giving 
them something to watch and listen to, in order to drown out the drone of the machines. Any man caught on the oscillators is branded as effemi-nate for the rest of his days.
 In the middle of the opposing 
sides is the Rec Sports staff kiosk, just like in a Clint Eastwood west-ern. Sans tumbleweeds, but still just as dangerous as it’s the staff mem-bers who have 
control over the music, the most precious 
and valuable 
commodity 
to be had in the gym. Many of the 
students that are cast into this teem-ing whirlpool choose to tune out the sounds and emotions around them, focusing only on the mundane mu-sic they fill their cavernous craniums with via headphones. For the few who enjoy conversation, we risk the 
whims of XM radio.
At the beginning of every semes-
ter, the staff sets up a poll, which, 
out of the hundreds of XM stations, lists five options, three of them for recent music, one for the ‘90s and one classic rock station. Despite my best attempts to stuff the ballot box-es this year, I note that whenever a 
certain, dollish Rec Sports girl with 
platinum blonde highlights saun-ters in, the station gets flipped to the ‘90s. Next thing I know, I’m two inches away from death by bench press, and “Bye Bye Bye” blares out through the speakers. Way to throw off my groove.
Now, let it be said that I believe 
music has different moods, and for different moods there are differ-ent activities. I should not have to listen to Kelly Clarkson swear out violent revenge on the male race while gasping through the military press. Workout music should set the blood afire, put the adrenaline to flow, and angry girl music does not, 
and will not, accomplish this. Is life 
so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased by the chains of slavery? I know not what course others may take; but as for me, Give me AC/DC or give me death!
In order to speak out for the 
masses, I’ve begun an underground revolution, using the weapons of the 
system against them: the comment 
box. Styling myself as “The Official Chapter of the He-Man Woman Hater’s Club” or the “Anti-Hip/Hop Initiative,” I’ve been leaving messages like “The song ‘Disturbia’ not only disturbs me, it reminds me of what a terrible actor Shia LaBeouf is,” or “Hearing ‘I Wanna Make 
Love Right Na Na Na’ is not a senti-
ment I feel while working out, and I hope that you will be responsible and cease in your attempts to en-courage others to do so.” 
This is the right and privilege 
of every man that has had to suffer through this sickening abomination. Surely we find ourselves in the mid-
dle of a great and terrible crisis, and 
as Thomas Paine wrote, “These are the times that try men’s souls.” I find we are called to and must follow the example of our forefathers and abol-ish this tyranny. Tomorrow night, I’m going to grab my tomahawk, put on the war paint, and dump the XM radio in the Rec Center swim-
ming pool. Just like Paul Revere 
woulda done.

Guest column
On-campus gym fails to consider the basic needs of malesMy father once explained to me the importance of good timing in rela-
tionships. “Never talk to women when they’re angry,” he told me 
one night as he plopped on the 
couch with a blanket and pillow. 
Women have the luxury (or 
curse) of timing programmed into them. They’re on a monthly clock. That’s probably how they know when we’re off.
Men fall anywhere between 
Big Ben and the blinking “12:00” 
on a VCR. 
For me, timing a move on a 
girl is like trying to merge onto 
the highway during rush hour. In the beginning, I keep inching forward as if I’m going to do something. I don’t, of course.
Suddenly, an opening! My 
heart pounds and I grin stupidly. 
Here it comes …and there it goes. 
I’m a vegetable.
After the eighth window 
closes, the panic starts to set in. A guy behind me shouts, “Get a move on, you pussy!” I say a prayer, hold my breath and gun it. If I don’t crash completely, I still make an ass of myself. 
And it’s not only “when” but 
“how long.” They say you have three seconds after making eye contact with a girl to make a move. That’s not enough time for me to approach 
her, freak out half way and run 
to the bathroom, repeat “You’re 
so ugly!” into the mirror, dry the tears, sing “Seasons of Love,” apologize to the perplexed line on my way out, and find her again, just to go blank and blurt out, “You’re so ugly!”
Now, if I can only get all that 
down to three seconds... 
Time of year is also important. 
I’ve found the best time to start dating is post-Valentine’s Day.
The only problem is that it’s 
right before spring break. A guy is forced to spoon so much that a week later when she’s dancing on a beach in Cancun with some shirtless local named Raul, the 
guilt will keep her faithful. After 
all, spring fever leaves most col-lege students “bedridden.”
Ultimately, there is no right 
moment. Things usually happen at the worst possible timing (just ask your parents). Aim for per-fect timing and you’ll probably miss the mark completely. And 
then you’ll end up sleeping on 
the couch like my dad.

younger teammates to help 
them get past their dismal showing this weekend.
He expects his team to re-
alize that type of performance is not accepted at UF and re-spond because of it.
The team also won’t have 
to hear about its poor play this past weekend from O’Sullivan.
“There’s not much to tell them,” O’Sullivan said. “If 
they can’t figure it out after 
this weekend, I don’t know what will.”
While the 
Gators expect 
to mentally 
recover from this weekend quickly, some 
of their arms will not be able to get ready as fast.
The team will feel the im-
pact of using 10 different pitchers in a weekend — in-
cluding five on Sunday — for 
more than just two days.
One of the pitchers used 
in relief Sunday was Jus-tin Poovey, who started last 
Tuesday against Eastern 
Michigan.
His 1 1/3 innings of work 
Sunday were enough to rule 
him out as the starter for 
tonight. Instead, Lake City Community College transfer Jeff Barfield is expected to open the game on the mound 
for the Gators.
Barfield entered the sea-
son as one of the candidates 
to be UF’s closer. He threw on Sunday, too, but he only 
pitched one inning and faced 
just four batters. He was the only Gators pitcher on Sun-day to not give up a run. 
Although he didn’t throw 
many pitches, he will prob-ably not be counted on to go deep into the game, which will require further use of a 
bullpen that is being called 
upon more and more.
Not only will Barfield have 
to deal with the pressure of his first start, but this will be 
the first time the Gators go on 
the road for a game.
UF won’t have to face the 
same type of crowd in De-Land tonight that it will face 
when it travels to the fields 
of Southeastern Conference foes, but the team still isn’t going to be greeted with the 
support it is accustomed to in 
Gainesville.
“It’s the first time on the 
road, so we are going to have to band together,” O’Sullivan 
said.TUESDAY, MARCH 3, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15

� THE TEAM WILL TRAVEL TO THE 
CAPITAL AFTER BEATING MIAMI.
By JOSEPH R. HOLZER
Alligator Writer
The UF men’s tennis team will attempt to 
avenge two losses when it goes to the Scott 
Speicher courts against FSU today at 5 p.m.
The Gators women lost to the Seminoles 
5-2 on Saturday, and the men dropped their 
previous dual match in Tallahassee in 2007.
The No. 12 men (8-3) are coming off a win 
against Miami on Feb. 22, which gives them not only time to rest but also the confidence coach Andy Jackson wants instilled in his 
players.
They are going to need that swagger go-
ing into a hostile environment, especially on 
the heels of FSU’s win on Saturday — one 
that is sure to have an already amped-up 
crowd raising the volume to 11.
“You go on the road — in Florida-Florida 
State, obviously you have a demon there, so it gives them an edge — but in the end, 
it’s going to be decided on the tennis courts, 
and I think that we can compete with them,” Jackson said.
The Seminoles (10-4) aren’t just a long-time rival, making a grudge match a possi-bility every year. At No. 16, they’re a threat 
to any team they trade volleys with. Three of 
FSU’s four losses have come 
against current top-10 teams — defending champion No. 2 
Georgia, No. 6 Texas and No. 
9 Mississippi.
In doubles, Jean-Yves Au-
bone and Clint Bowles are 
ranked No. 34 for the Seminoles, and are 
Nos. 19 and 55 in singles, respectively.
The duo will likely face UF’s Antoine 
Benneteau and Joey Burkhardt on Court 1. 
The Gators’ tandem is No. 23.Benneteau said he is excited about play-
ing the role of villain. After beating South 
Florida and Miami, the junior is up to the 
challenge of helping his team be the elite squad in The Sunshine State.
“Florida State is another rivalry in the 
same state,” he said. “We just want to beat them, just go in as best we can. The best men are going to win, but we’re going to be ready to go over there.”
Beginning at 5 p.m. also favors the home 
team since more spectators are likely to show up to cheer on their players, Jackson said. But he believes FSU’s war cry won’t be the only one heard tonight.UF looks to avenge past losses against No. 16 FSU
ovan said. 
“There is a change and a shift for a 
guy who was a leading scorer to this 
kind of role.”
Shipman admits it can be frustrating 
at times but said he understands he can 
best help the team in other ways right 
now.
“I’m real impatient,” Shipman said. 
“Going from 25 points (a game) in high 
school to getting two shots a game, there’s been some sleepless nights.”Shipman has shown signs that he 
can be a solid scoring option in recent weeks. 
His ability to at-
tack the rim is a di-
mension that has been 
sorely missing from the 
Gators’ offense this sea-son.
Shipman followed 
up an athletic baseline drive and reverse layup 
late in the second half against Tennes-see with a deep three in front of the UF bench on the following possession.“My shots before haven’t been confi-
dent. That was confident,” Shipman said. “I felt like I was back in high school, like I was playing ball again.”
Coaches have pointed to former UF 
swingman Corey Brewer as the blue-
print for Shipman’s development.
Brewer, like Shipman, was used 
primarily as a defensive specialist as a 
freshman before going on to become a 
starter and one of the nation’s most dy-
namic players.
“They always use Corey as an exam-
ple,” Shipman said. 
“I’m tired of hearing Corey’s name.”Athletic forward tired of comparisons to Brewer
ference meet this weekend (no titles 
since 2004). That’s the standard here in Gainesville.
7. YOU HOPEFULLY WON’T GO MISS-
ING —  Ahem, Alex Tyus. You’ve had 
a heck of a breakout year, man, but you have only scored 13 points com-bined in two games against Tennes-see. Length is Tennessee’s forte, but 
the Gators need Tyus.6. YOU WON’T BE ON CRUTCHES  —  
You will be able to walk around nor-
mally, something softball senior Kim 
Waleszonia sadly will be unable to do. 
UF’s center fielder sustained an un-
known injury to her left leg Saturday, 
just one day after breaking the school 
career hits record. It will be key to see 
how much time she must miss.5. YOU WON’T BURN OUT — like the 
UF women’s basketball team seems to be doing. The Gators are now 1-4 
since topping Tennessee at home and 
seem as if they certainly peaked early. They will likely have a rematch with 
the Volunteers in Friday’s SEC Tour-nament Quarterfinals. I predict a Ten-
nessee win, but more on this later.4. YOU WON’T FEEL ExTREME PRES-
SURE — Certainly nothing like the UF 
men’s basketball team will feel during 
the next two weeks. This team doesn’t

3. YOU WON’T BE EMBARRASSE d — 
The UF baseball team built up every-one’s hopes with a season-opening 
sweep of Louisville and then got 
swept at home by Miami. Yes, Friday 
and Saturday’s games were close. But 
they were still losses, and home ones 
at that. But 16-2? That’s just ugly. 
2. YOU WON’T SIT AROUNd WAITING 
FOR BAd NEWS  — If the UF women’s 
basketball team loses in the SEC Tour-nament Quarterfinals as I predicted 
earlier, it will have to wait 10 days for 
Selection Monday on March 16. The 
Gators are a lock to make the Field of 
64, but ESPN.com’s current bracket 
projection has them going to Seattle 
for a first-round game. I’m smelling a 
one-and-done.1. Y OU WON’T MAKE HISTORY (IN A 
BAd WAY)  — While you’re stumbling 
back to Gainesville on March 15, the 
UF men’s basketball team will be 
gathering for Selection Sunday. After 
10 straight years in the Big Dance, the 
Gators will face a three-lettered fate

The transition from high 
school to college hasn’t been an 
easy one for Ray Shipman.
In just a few short months, the 
state of Florida’s reigning Mr. Basketball has gone from offen-sive superstar to defensive role 
player.
Shipman is probably the 
Gators’ best athlete, and on a 
team struggling to find a respect-able vertical leap, UF coach Billy 
Donovan has used the freshman 
as the one player who can help his team match up physically with the bigger, quicker bodies of 
the Southeastern Conference.
“For Ray, understanding the 
impact he could make defensive-
ly and then understanding that on the offensive end of the floor 
he may not be a priority or an 
option,” Donovan said. “That’s been the big learning curve.”
The adjustment to his new role 
didn’t come as fast as Shipman thought or hoped it would.
“I knew coming in, but I didn’t 
know it would be like this,” Ship-man said. “I thought I would be able to get a little more into the offensive system.”
The team has routinely relied 
on Shipman to slow down oppo-
nents’ best offensive players. It’s 
a role he has tried to use to his advantage.
“Do whatever you can do to 
get on the court,” Shipman said. “You can’t score on the bench. If you’re out there, things are going 
to happen.”
Though he 
has excelled as the team’s de-fensive stop-per, the 6-foot-5 
forward wants 
people to know 
there’s more to his game than steals and rebounds.
“I’m not just a defensive play-
er,” Shipman said. 
“It wasn’t like that in high 
school. My offense is just as good.”
Shipman is averaging 3.8 
points per game this season and is often all but overlooked on of-fense.
“It’s probably not totally fair 
for Ray in a lot of respects,” Don-

you’re out getting plastered, spring athletes 
will likely be stuck in Gainesville. No team needs to stay healthy more than the UF women’s tennis team, which is currently 
playing with only 
five scholarship play-

Ouch.

Some lessons don’t need to be 
stressed over and over again by a 
coach.
Getting over a weekend sweep — 
including a 16-2 loss Sunday — at the hands of Miami is one of those les-sons.
The Gators (5-3) will get their 
chance to do so on the field at Stetson (2-6) tonight at 6:30.
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan is glad 
his team does not have to wait long to 
get an opportunity to put last week-
end behind it.
“(Playing again so soon) is prob-
ably the best remedy,” O’Sullivan said. “It doesn’t give you a chance to think about it.”
Even though there is not much 
time to think about the sweep, a 16-2 loss isn’t something that is just for-gotten.
Senior first baseman Brandon 
McArthur expected Monday’s prac-tice to help the team deal with the sweep.
“You’ve got to find a way (to get 
over the losses),” he said Sunday. “We’ll wake up (Monday), and it’s a whole new day. We’ll come out for practice and get better.”
As a leader of the team, McArthur 
is looked to for advice, but he doesn’t feel the need to say anything to his UF BASEBALLGators try to look past
