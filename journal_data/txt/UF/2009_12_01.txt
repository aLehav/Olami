Teachers told to

'swine whiners'
* PROFESSORS CAN NOW
REQUIRE DOCTOR'S NOTES.

Students will no longer be able
to fake a case of swine flu to avoid
looming exams and research pa-
pers.
Associate Provost Bernard Mair
released a memo to university
deans, directors and department
chairs last week explaining pro-
fessors can now require students
to provide medical documentation
of illness if they miss exams or fail
to turn in assignments during fi-
nals week.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando
said documentation was not re-quired earlier in the semester be-
cause the university wanted to
make it as easy as possible for sick
students to stay home.
But Orlando said the number of
swine flu cases has lessened.
Orlando said he predicts some
faculty members will take ad-
vantage of the opportunity to re-
quire written proof

"For some students, the temp-

lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences,
said he does not think the policy

Condoms and candy canes were an
unlikely pair Monday night in the Reitz
Union Grand Ballroom as the beginning
of the holiday season fused with global
health concerns.
UF's recognition of World AIDS Day
began with about 200 people attending
the Be inspiRED event.
"We're such a large university, and we
have such a diverse student body. I-nv
doesn't affect one group of people. It af-
fects everyone," said Cody Talcott, UF's
LGBTQ Student Affairs director, who
donned a red necktie and red AIDS rib-
bon on his dress shirt.
Multicolored condoms dotted moref AIDS day
than 500 chairs at the event as organiza-
tions passed out red ribbons, candy canes
and more condoms.
The event, which featured dance per-
formances from Delta Sigma Theta Soror-
ity Inc. and Apocalypse Dance Troupe,
was designed to edu-
cate the audience about
the disease that killed
more than 2 million
children in 2008.
"When it comes to
HIV/AIDS, it does not
discriminate based on
Evans gender, race, sexual
orientation, creed, col-
or, nothing," said Samantha Evans, sexual

Cafe Gardens future shaky
By JULIE UNGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Cafe Gardens owner Steve McKinney
met with landlords Monday to discuss rent
negotiations that will determine the future
of 33-year-old restaurant.
"We had a good meeting," McKinney
said, adding that those involved did not
want the press to know details.
According to McKinney, Cafe Gardens
could see the cost of its rent jump by 472
percent, based on calculations in a letter he
received from the property's owner, Tn-
mark Properties.
While trying to dispel rumors about the
future, McKinney said he has been talking
openly with employees about the situation.
"The staff knows what's going on, and I
keep updating them and letting them know
how we progress. Hopefully this can all get
worked out and is just a bump in the road,"
he said.
After sending an e-mail to friends andfamily, his inbox has been flooded and his
cell phone battery drained from the barrage
of responses, he said.
"People are upset. I think the caf6 is the
oldest independent, unchanged restaurant
in west Gainesville," he said.

STUDENT LIFE
Students join forces to remember Mumbai attacks
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Bhavesh Lad remembers the
sinking feeling that pervaded as
the news came out from Mumbai,
India, just more than a year ago.
"It was fearful," the UF gradu-
ate student said. "Everyone was
very fearful."
His mother was working about
a mile from one of the bombing
sites during the terrorist attacks
that gripped the city on Nov. 26,
2008, and did not relent for four
days.Though Lad's mother was not
hurt, the attacks left more than 160
dead and more than 300 injured.
UF students honored these
victims Monday night at a can-
dlelight vigil in the Reitz Union
Amphitheatre to commemorate
the one-year anniversary of the
attacks.
About 50 people lit candles to
remember those affected by the
tragedy and to show solidarity in
the effort for peace in a vigil de-
void of any special agenda.
"This is not political or religious
at all," said Ellen Kruk, Gators for"You create living memori-
als through good acts and
good deeds."
Rabbi Berl Goldman,
co-director of the Lubavitch
Chabad Jewish Center
Israel vice president and one of
the organizers of the event.
"It's about peace and remem-
brance," she said.
In their first co-sponsored
event, the vigil was organized by
the Indian Student Association
and Gators for Israel, along withthe Jewish Student Union and the
Lubavitch Chabad Jewish Student
Center.
Distinguished Professor and
Department of Religion chair-
woman Vasudha Narayanan gave
a few words during the vigil on
the importance of recognizing hu-
man unity and stopping the cycle
of violence that leads to tragedies
like this.
"What we do have to remind
ourselves is that an eye for an eye
will eventually make the whole
world blind," she said.
Rabbi Berl Goldman, co-di-rector of the Lubavitch Chabad
Jewish Center, led a moment of si-
lence before charging attendees to
commemorate the dead through
example.
"You create living memori-
als through good acts and good
deeds," he said.
Lad later remembered his par-
ents telling him of the resolve of
Mumbai's citizens in the days af-
ter the attacks.
"Everyone went back to nor-
mal," he said. "I think that's a very
strong way of going about life, to
challenge the terrorists."

Game Day Gators haul around on four-seat bicycle
-u by. Lu umc -milg 
,
The "quadralator," a four-person, orange-and-blue bicycle, rides past cars before a home UF football
game earlier this year.0 THEY GOT THE IDEA FROM
THE MOVIE 'BEERFEST.'
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Some UF students took a bicycle
built for two to the next level.
Engineering seniors Thomas
Reed and Chad Hughes can be seen
riding the "quadralator," a four-
person, orange-and-blue bicycle
they built earlier this year, around
campus with two other friends on
game days.
Reed said the idea came about
when he was sitting in Marston
Library with Hughes one day, add-
ing that he originally got the idea
from a movie.
"I saw 'Beerfest,' actually, and
they made a five seater, so it was
definitely possible," he said.
Hughes had a bicycle he was
willing to donate to the endeavor,
and Reed along with two other
friends, Andrew Cain and Michael
Powers, all bought identical bicy-
cles to combine to the four seater.
Reed said it took him about three
days before the beginning of the fallsemester to build the superbicycle.
He then handed it off to Hughes to
add the finishing touches.
"I got it to work first and then
Chad took about two days just tak-
ing it apart and painting it," Reed
said.
The four friends ride their or-
ange and blue masterpiece up Gale
Lemerand Drive to the stadium,
dressed in wacky getups, for each
home game.
"We always try to look kind of
ridiculous," Reed said.
Reed said they dressed in Daisy
Dukes denim shorts for the UF-
Georgia game, just to go along with
the stereotype.
People laugh and cheer when
they ride by on their bicycle, he
said.
"They always are amazed at the
number of guys we can put on a bi-
cycle," Reed said.
But don't be fooled by their silly
appearances; Hughes said the bicy-
cle is difficult to ride because there's
more weight to pedal around.
"You'd think with four people
you'd have four times the speed,"
he said, "but in reality it's more
work."
LOCAL
South Gville to get makeover
By WILLIAM O'CONNOR
Alligator Contributing Writer
Renovations in south Gainesville are spur-
ring a downtown renaissance.
Lynch Park, formerly a space used largely
by the homeless, will get a name change and a
makeover, including turning much of the open
space into a dog park, according to Kelly Huard
Fisher, a spokeswoman for the Gainesville Com-
munity Redevelopment Agency.
Anticipating the park's new look and the
facelift the city is conducting on Main Street,
surrounding businesses are inspired to create a
miniature artistic haven.
Chris Fillie, the owner of two renovated
storefronts at Main Street and Fifth Avenue, ref-
erenced New York City's SoHo when describ-
ing the new mindset of downtown business
owners.
"When the owners of our businesses get to-
gether, we now refer to the area as SoDo, which
is short for South of Downtown."
Fillie owns George's Meet and Produce, a
gathering place at 435 S Main St. that holds per-
formances, classes, lectures and provides gen-
eral studio production space for artists.
Fillie said the only thing that has changed
about the store in 50 years is its spelling. The lo-
cation was a grocery store called George's Meat
and Produce, and the name seemed too fitting
to change.
He also owns Coming Soon, which will ex-
hibit and sell local handmade products at 437
S Main St.
Because of the stores' proximity to the area
undergoing to makeover, Fillie said he's excited
about the city's plans.
But not everyone agrees with the improve-
ment.
James Schmidt, manager of the Civic Media
Center, 433 S Main St., sees the changes as an
excuse to push the poor around.
"I don't like fences," Schmidt said. "This isjust a removal of public space in order to create
another control zone."
He expressed concern for the homeless, who
will be forced to abandon the park in favor of a
less public area.
The west side of Main Street's Fifth Avenue
separates the park from a new steak and sea-
food restaurant under construction.
The restaurant will be called Warehouse Din-
ing Restaurant and Lounge and is the dream of
Richard Yoh, who has owned the property for
30 years.
Previously, he rented the site to an imported
auto parts store and repair shop, but now the
neighborhood finally seems ready for an up-
scale eatery and nightclub, especially with the
dog park and street remake that's in the works,
he said.
"I don't like fences. This is just a
removal of public space in order to
create another control zone."
James Schmidt
manager of the Civic Media Center
Fisher said the new park's north side will
be reserved for dogs, while the south side will
have benches, lighting and plants indigenous to
the region.
The new park will be named Halsey Lynch
Park in honor of the woman who donated the
approximate 1 1/2-acre plot, and the project has
a budget of about $85,000, according to minutes
from 2008 city meetings.
According to Fisher, the downtown projects
will be financed by the city parks department
and subsidized with special district taxes. She
explained these taxes are provided by added
revenue from the increased property values of
projects the agency has already funded.
Fisher said the city is awaiting building per-
mits, but the park should be completed within
two to three months.Students 'organ'-ize
for semester recital
By MEAD BOWEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Eclipsing the back wall of the
stage, 5,356 brass and wooden
pipes dwarfed the keyboard
where a petite organist sat.
The room darkened, and
Melanie Yeager, one of six stu-
dents in UF's Organ Studio, a
pipe organ performance pro-
gram, set her fingers to the
keys.
The Andrew Anderson
Memorial Organ was played
publicly for the last time this
semester on Monday night,
showcasing the few UF mu-
sicians with the expertise to
touch the historic instrument.
More than 60 people attend-
ed the recital, an improvement
from the average attendance of
about 50.
Laura Ellis, associate pro-
fessor of music and director of
the Organ Studio, said she was
pleased with the turnout.
"Since we have such a won-
derful instrument, it is natural
for there to be an organ studio
at UF," she said.
According to Ellis, the An-
drew Anderson Memorial Or-
gan is one of the largest in the
southeastern U.S."It's quite a draw for poten-
tial students," she said.
The organ was certainly one
of the assets that attracted Erica
Wessling, a third-year German
major and pipe organ perfor-
mance minor.
"I like the versatility of the
instrument," said Wessling,
who played Johannes Brahms'
"Es ist ein ros' entsprungen"
and both "Prelude in G Major"
and "In dulci jubilo" by Johann
Sebastian Bach.
On "You can play
Campus pieces from differ-
ent time periods,
and it sounds authentic," she
said.
Students performed 10 com-
positions, ranging from ba-
roque and Renaissance pieces
to modern melodies.
Though the organ recital
was the 39th program in the
2009-2010 School of Music
Events Series, this particular
recital happens only once ev-
ery semester.
The next organ recital will
be held on Jan. 8 and will fea-
ture Ellis, who also plays the
harpsichord and the carillon,
the Century Tower bells heard
throughout the day on the UF
campus.

Group collects recyclables
0 UF GREEN TEAM COLLECTED 29,000
POUNDS OF RECYCLABLES LAST YEAR.
By KATHLEEN BIRKHIMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Among the orange, blue and occasional
rival colors decorating campus this football
season was a bit of green.
The UF Green Team completed its fourth
season at the UF-FSU game, and according to
volunteer and program assistant Stephanie
Sims, it is growing.
"[The Green Team] isn't going away; [it's]
getting bigger and stronger each year," she
said.
Volunteers for the Green Team are assigned
to zones to offer recycle bags to tailgaters.
Volunteers can sign up to work for an orga-
nization, and each hour of their time will earn
their club or team a share of money donated
by Pepsi each year. In addition to the funds,
volunteers said they received a warm wel-
come from tailgaters this year, who not only
recognize, but expect, the green T-shirts.
"People are used to seeing green shirts now.[They] are happy to do something good for
the Earth while having fun," Sims said.
The UF Green Team program collected
29,000 pounds of recyclables last season, said
Jordan Weinstein, an intern at UF's Office of
Sustainability, who was responsible for orga-
nizing the event this year.
That number came from the efforts of 250
volunteers, clocking 862 hours together. Each
hour earned $5.88 last year.
This year's results were un-
On available at press time.
CampUS The number of volunteers and
the amount of recyclables collect-
ed varied from game to game this year, Wein-
stein said. Factors like kickoff time and who
the Gators were playing contributed to how
many volunteers signed up. Saturday's game
saw an unusually low number of volunteers.
The program is a part of the Office of Sus-
tainability's goal to create a zero-waste cam-
pus by 2015.
Game Day waste is particularly important,
Sims said.
"You bring in so many people and waste
in one weekend," she said. "It catches atten-
tion."St orm ae son ends

Premium Price
Taxpayers shouldn't pay
for lawmakers' insuranceWhile Florida lawmakers and top state employees are
criticizing Congress' efforts to extend health care to
more poor people, they have fought to protect an en-
titlement of their own: free insurance premiums.
According to the Miami Herald, Florida taxpayers shell
out some $45 million per year to cover the premiums of 27,479
state employees.
But many of these employees are high-level bureaucrats
and political appointees, 2,431 of whose salaries are more than
$100,000.
Even the families of these top earners can cash in on the
plan. Charlie Cris t's new wife, a wealthy businesswoman and
philanthropist, will soon pay nothing for insurance premi-
ums.
And the gravy train does not stop at the Florida border.
Crist's wife has two children from a previous marriage who
live with their father -an even wealthier New York man who
owns a jet rental company. Yes, they will also enjoy free pre-
miums, paid for with taxpayer dollars.
As Florida has faced three straight years of budgets paint-
ed red, and as lawmakers have promised to cut unnecessary
spending, these over-generous benefits should be first on the
list.
Florida's Chief Financial Officer, Alex Sink, who earns
$129,000 plus subsidized insurance, said that the benefits are
merely part of a total compensation package. Others argue
that government employees get paid less than those in the pri-
vate sector -so the insurance serves to balance that out.
But any state employee earning more than $100,000 is not
in desperate need of subsidized health insurance. At least not
as bad as the poor Florida residents they are arguing to keep
it from.
Are they in desperate need of a pay cut and a reality check?
Maybe.
Fool's Flu
our mother's incessantnagging is no longer
the best reason to get
a flu vaccine. Now it's grade
concerns that will push stu-
dents into the vaccine lines.
(Let's face it -health wor-
ries are never on the top of
the list.)
A memo released last
week to university deans,

Mair, who sent the memo,
surely had swine-flu-fakers
in mind when formulating
the policy change, along
with the declining numbers
of new swine flu cases in
and around Gainesville.But a resurgent swine
flu, a spike in the regular
seasonal flu or even the cur-
rent swine flu (albeit at dis-
appointingly subpandemic
levels) could pose a threat to
students' health.
This is because the new
policy will compel students
to attend exams if they feel
ill but have not concretely
determined whether they
have the flu.
Putting potentially infec-
tious students in a room with
up to 400 others for hours
sounds like a nightmare sce-
nario. But it's bound to hap-
pen, regardless of the policy
changes.
UF's responsibility is
merely to limit the risk. If
this new policy does the
opposite, the administra-
tion should really consider
what's more of a threat: fak-
ers or infectious test-takers.

Say what you would regret leaving unsaid
like this question, even if it's a little morbid: If you knew
you were going to die this evening, and you couldn't
talk to anyone between now and then, what would you
most regret not telling someone?
I can't claim it as my own; I've heard several different
people, in several different situations, with several different
levels of sobriety pose some permutation of this question.
That particular phrasing, in fact, closely resembles the one
found in Gregory Stock's 1987 book "The Book of Ques-
tions."
I posed the question to 24 people on the Plaza of the
Americas a couple of weeks ago, and I got an array of
thoughtful, different answers.
Many of the answers involved family.
For instance, Anandini Maharaj, 21, said she would want
to tell her mother how much she respects her.
"She raised me and my two sisters on her own, and she
sacrificed a lot for us," Maharaj said. "And I don't think I
tell her how much I really respect her, how much she's in-
fluenced my life and how much she means to me."
"My brother is my favorite person, but also, he was an
asshole to me, and I want to tell him that," Marie Stewart,
21, said. "But I appreciate that. I think because we had so
much trouble before, that's why we're so close right now."
Erin Fasig, 19, said that she and her sister haven't had a
very good relationship lately, and that she'd want to say,
"Sorry for being an ass sometimes."
Many people said that they don't doubt that their friends
and family know they love them, but it's more understood
than explicitly stated.
"It's like getting a Hallmark card," said Chris Gonzales,
21. "You already know the feelings that are expressed, but
it's just nice to hear it."
And Noah Camenker, 20, mentioned his regret involves
a girl.
"We were talking about stuff, and then there was a long
pause," Camenker said. "If I could go back in time, I'd prob-Joe DellosaI n 11ably try to use that pause."
Whether we want to admit it, we
all live our lives with some mental es-
timation of when we're going to die
and act accordingly. Everything we
would regret not saying before we
died that we choose to continue not
to say is an indication of how far out
ers a ga-ror_ , we've pushed that estimation.
Ultimately, every "I love you"
you leave unspoken, every apology you don't make and
every feeling of appreciation and admiration you let go
unexpressed is a bet against death that you'll have another
opportunity to say these things tomorrow. It is, admittedly,
a bet that you'll almost always win -but really, it's the sort
of bet you only need to lose once.
And I'm as guilty of making that bet as anybody else.
When interviewees would shoot the question back at me,
I'd give some vague answer about regretting not telling one
of my best friends that I love her one last time. But that's
only partially true.
Here's a more complete, oversharing answer: I'd regret
not telling her that she's the first girl I've ever loved and
been in love with at the same time. I'd regret not telling her
that each time I'm able to be more empathetic and less of an
impatient jackass with people, I think of her and how she's
helped me be more understanding and compassionate.
And I'd regret not telling her that we really should've got-
ten that coffee, even if it would've been at a shitty Huddle
House at 3 a.m.
There is almost never a good reason not to say the things
you'd regret leaving unsaid. Not to be presumptuous, but
there's probably someone who sprang to mind when you
read the question, and there's almost certainly a cell phone
near you right now. I'm just saying .

Guest column
Republican Party needs to realize all politics are local
he Republican Party has recently drafted a Purity Reso-lution. If passed, any candidate seeking support from
the Republican National Committee would be required
to support at least eight of the 10 resolutions named by the
committee.
This is a bad idea no matter what is written. If this proposal
is accepted, it will be the culmination of the complete takeover
by Southern conservatives of the Republican Party.
Political parties exist to get elected. Once you get elected,
then you can worry about governing. To see the advantages of
a diverse assortment of candidates, look at the 2006 election.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee,
headed by Rahm Emanuel, recruited candidates that reflect
their district and, as a result, the Democrats took control of
Congress.
That obviously wasn't the only factor, but if you are a con-
servative independent, it is a lot easier to support a conserva-
tive Democrat than a liberal Democrat.
Looking at this resolution, the first thing that strikes me is
how vague the wording is. Point six is: "We support victory
in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military-recommend-
ed troop surges." This creates a classic strawman that holds
an unpopular position that the audience will automatically
oppose because no one supports defeat. Of course everyone
wants our military to be victorious.
But which military leader are we supposed to listen to? Gen.
Stanley McChrystal submitted an initial recommendation forNick Miner 40,000 additional troops. But there are
Speaking Out also recommendations for smaller surg-
es. Then there are some military person-
nel, specifically retired senior generals,
who are arguing we need to begin our withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. Which military do Republicans support?
There is a reason the founding fathers placed the military
under civilian control, and we should not be so ready to aban-
don this protection. If we hadn't overruled our military lead-
ers in Vietnam, we would still be there.
Then, there is the issue of what is victory in Afghanistan. Is
victory a strong central government or simply denying terror-
ists a safe haven? This point sounds great but says nothing.
Point eight says: "We support retention of the Defense of
Marriage Act." This point is not surprising, but again limits
their ability to recruit candidates in liberal districts. It is as if
the Republican Party doesn't want to compete in New Eng-
land.
Some of the other positions include: opposition to amnesty
for illegal immigrants, opposition to the Obama-style "stimu-
lus" bill, opposition to government-run health care, opposi-
tion to cap and trade, opposition to health care rationing and
government funding of abortion, and opposition to govern-
ment restrictions on gun ownership.
The word opposition, or some form of it, is found in seven
of the 10 points. The Republican Party is trying to define it-
self by what it opposes. This is not a strategy for good gover-nance.
Then there is the plethora of code words. Amnesty.
Obama's stimulus. Surges. Government-run health care. Card
Check. This is red meat to Republican supporters. Oh, and just
in case you didn't know, the health care plan for the Republi-
can Party covers elective abortions.
The nomination of John McCain may have seriously crip-
pled the Republican Party because his loss discredited moder-
ate conservatives. You cannot be a national party by demand-
ing uniformity. The United States is not uniform.
It is only logical that candidate positions should reflect
their constituents. Look at the NY-23 special election this year.
This was a moderate Republican seat that had not been held
by a Democrat in more than 100 years. Not during FDR. Not
after Watergate.
The local Republican Party nominated a moderate, Dierdre
Scozzafava, to run against the Democratic party's nomination,
Bill Owens. Scozzafava supported tax cuts and opposed gun
control, but her great crime was supporting gay rights and be-
ing pro-choice. "True" conservatives revolted and ran a third
candidate, Doug Hoffman, who did not reflect local constitu-
ents.
The end result is a Democrat now holds the seat for the
first time since the 1870s. All politics are local. The Democrats
know this, and it is no coincidence that they control the White
House and both chambers of Congress.

City covers art for AIDS
0 HIDDEN ART WILL
ACKNOWLEDGE AIDS DAY.
By KRISTEN BOWE
Alligator Contributing Writer
It may be a little dark on North-
west Eighth Avenue today.
In honor of Day With(out) Art/
World AIDS Day, city officials said
they will cover the solar walk sculp-
tures, concrete statues that represent
the solar system, in black from a.m.
to 5 p.m.
The black coverings symbolize a
world without art.
This will be the fourth time the
city has held the demonstration.
Erin Friedberg, visual arts coor-
dinator for the city's Art in Public
Places Trust, said the idea to cover
the solar walk started in 2005, but the
city only covered the sun in black to
represent a world without light.
In 2008, the city decided to cover
all of the sculptures to have a greaterimpact, Friedberg said.
This year, the city will expand the
black coverings to all of the walk's
benches and the recently added a
Halley's Comet sculpture using re-
cyclable plastic, Friedberg said.
The Day With(out) Art began on
Dec. 1, 1989, as a national day of ac-
tion and mourning in response to
the AIDS crisis. Eight hundred U.S.
art and AIDS groups
Local participated in the
New first Day With(out)Art by shutting down
museums, sending
staff to volunteer at AIDS services
and sponsoring special exhibitions
of work about AIDS.
Friedberg said the project has
grown to incorporate 8,000 muse-
ums, art centers, AIDS organiza-
tions, schools and other public insti-
tutions in the U.S.
She said it shows the impact
of AIDS on the art world and pro-
motes awareness and prevention of
the disease.Copyrighted Material ..

in their plans, taking him on as their
chief executive adviser. By April 1,
1976, their dream had become a re-
ality, and Cafe Gardens opened for
business.
By 1979, the business had traded
hands but found its way back to
McKinney.
"M often say Cafe Gardens wasn't
really planned, it just evolved. Inwhere it is and how it fits, and the
courtyard and everything -it's
very nice," he said.
"I've been working there for
three years, and people come in all
the time [who] were past employees
or used to go here when they were
in school," said Alex Gilwit, a wait-
ress at the restaurant. "It would be
really sad if Cafe Gardens closed."

est college.
He said the policy described in the memo rep-
resents a return to the attendance policy before
swine flu came along.
D'Anieri said discussions with CLAS faculty
and observations of his International Relations
class lead him to believe swine flu has not really
affected CLAS attendance.
But the new policy could affect students.
Leah Chapman, a UF religion and political sci-
ence junior, said getting a doctor's note could be
inconvenient for students who have swine flu.
Chapman said she lives off campus but doesn'tIf she contracted swine flu, she could risk
spreading the disease to the people riding her bus
or driving her to the doctor, she
said.
Despite the decline in cases,
she is still concerned about get-
ting swine flu as she prepares for
Winter Break.
"On my way home, I'm defi-
.Nnitely stopping to get a shot,"
Chapman said.
On Wednesday, the Student Health Care Cen-
ter will give out 50 vaccines every 30 minutes

AIDS, from page 1
Promotion Services. "Its main goal
is to infect and continue to infect."
And as UF and the rest of The
Gator Nation recognize the 21st
World AIDS Day today, Evans sug-
gested that UF students critically
examine their sexual health as theybegin studying for final exams.
"Students should think about
their health year-round," Evans
said, as she discussed the daylong
increased interest in HIV/AIDS
testing on World AIDS Day.
Jaymes Moore started planning
for today's global health observance
two years ago.
Moore, a UF graphic design se-nior, created a visual display that
will be showcased at the Student
Health Care Center today from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m.
On Moore described
CampUS his art as the anti-scare
method to AIDS pre-
vention.
"All the statistics and the num-
bers kind of numb people," he said.The 6-foot sculpture, "HI VIS,"
which stands for HIV Visual Impact
Sculpture, contains more than 200
red condoms and was designed to
encourage people to take the con-
doms to prevent the spread of sexu-
ally transmitted infections.
Although Evans stressed AIDS
is still a serious health concern, she
said medical advances are improv-ing the quality of life for those in-
fected.
"It has a one-track mind," Evans
said. "If it has a way to infect, it will
find it. It's not unstoppable, but it's
here. It's present."

It wasn't just the post players doing work.
Guards put an emphasis on assisting the in-
side game by grabbing rebounds.
Butler admitted one of the pleasant sur-
prises heading into today's game was how
good a defensive team her squad could be.
While defense was an
early concern for the coach-
ing staff, shooting the ball,
which was thought to be aWomen's more reliable commodity at
Basketball the beginning of the season,
has moved up the list of
coaching concerns.
With UF struggling to shoot the ball so far
this season, the defense will have to be tight
if the Gators are going to stay in ball games
when the shots aren't falling.
And if it's one of those days where the rim
seems to have a lid on it, the defense will be
relied upon to generate offense through fast-
break points coming on layups and scoring
off turnovers.
Butler isn't overlooking the Rattlers.
"It would absolutely make their season
to come to Florida and beat the Gators," she
said.

Welcome back Colt McCoy to the alligatorSports Heisman Watch. The
winningest quarterback in college football history logged his second
straight game with four touchdown passes. McCoy is coming on strong
down the stretch, and he had his best game this past weekend against
Texas A&M. He threw for304 yards and added another 175 on the ground,
including a 65-yard touchdown scamper. It he puts up big numbers
against Nebraska in the Big 12 Championship Game and Tim Tebow loses
to Alabama, he may not make it to the top of our list, but there's a good chance he'll be
toting the bronze statue in New York when all is said and done.HAdd Tate to the list of our candidates who had their
best games of the season this past Saturday. The junior
wide receiver caught 10 passes for 201 yards and three
touchdowns in a loss against Stanford, and there is little
question that he has been the most productive wide
receiver from a major program. Unfortunately for Tate,
Notre Dame is in the middle of a meltdown and a 6-6
record makes it nearly impossible to even be considered for a Heisman

UF climbs into top 25 rankings after big week
Florida will host Florida A&M tonight at 7
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Florida has been on a roller-
coaster ride through the rankings
the last two years.
The Gators leapt into the top 25
after winning three quality noncon-
ference games last week, coming
in at No. 13 in the Associated Press
poll and No. 17 in the ESPN/USA
Today Poll.
The last two seasons, UF has
been in the AP Top 25 seven times.
The Gators made two one-week ap-
pearances during the 2007-08 sea-
son and were ranked from No. 17
to No. 23 the first four weeks of the
2008-09 season before falling out
and making a brief return in Janu-
ary.
Fresh off his team's highest rank-
ing since winning back-to-back na-
tional championships, coach Billy
Donovan is looking to see how UF
(6-0) handles its recent success in its
game tonight at 7 in the O'Connell
Center against Florida A&M (0-7).
"The biggest thing is going to be
to have a level of humility," Dono-
van said. "Hopefully through their
past experiences, these guys can
deal with the fact that we had a
great week."
The last time Florida was in the
top 25 was Jan. 19, when it snuck
in at No. 24 before losing to South
Carolina and falling back out of the
rankings. That instance was largely
representative of UF's inability tostay ranked throughout the last two
seasons -something Donovan at-
tributed to his team's immaturity
during that span.
"Failures and disappointments
are always a lot easier to handle
than successes," Donovan said.
"Generally when you're going
through adversity, it's pretty clearyou have one thing to do. You've
got to fight, you've got to battle,
you've got to keep on working -
it's pretty clear-cut. But how do you
manage when you have a level of
success?"
Although UF won't be facing the
high-caliber teams it did last week,
the Gators are focused on not let-ting up despite the lower level of
competition.
"It's like I told these guys, 'Is
that all we're playing for? To have a
great week?' Donovan said. "The
goal is how do we improve and
how do we get better, because I
think we still have a lot of room for
improvement."
Despite the ranking, Donovan
pointed out that his team is still

not rebounding as well as it should
be and shooting poorly from 3-point
range (26 percent). But given the
way the Gators have grinded their
way to an undefeated start even
with those flaws, Donovan is en-
couraged by the potential his team
has shown.
"I would be concerned right
now as a coach if I said, 'Gosh,
we're clicking on all cylinders here
in November. I don't see any room
for improvement,"' Donovan said.
"I still think we can get a lot better
than we are right now."
WALKER WINS SEC PLAYER OF THE
WEEK: After being named MVP of
the Legends Classic this weekend,
Erving Walker earned another hon-
or Monday, winning Southeastern
Conference Player of the Week.
The sophomore point guard
averaged 12 points, five assists, 2.3
rebounds and 1.7 steals per game
last week in Florida's wins against
Florida State, Michigan State and
Rutgers. His clutch performance
down the stretch against the Spar-
tans, including a 3-pointer with 1:55
remaining, helped lead the Gators
to their biggest win in more than
two years.
Walker is the first Florida player
to earn the honor since Nick Cal-
athes did so on Jan. 12 and the sec-
ond since Corey Brewer won it on
Feb. 12, 2007.
"I'm happy with that," Walker
said. "But I'm much more happy
with our two wins down there in
New Jersey and our whole team's
improvement."
UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators seek consistency with Rattlers coming to town
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Splitting games over the Thanksgiving
break may not have been the ideal way to
ring in the holiday for Florida, but there's
little time to dwell on the past weekend
with Florida A&M (3-2) coming to town at
4:30 this afternoon.
Florida managed a 71-60 win over FIU
on Sunday to salvage its FIU Thanksgiv-
ing Classic experience after losing 61-47 to
St. John's on Friday , but UF (3-3) is look-
ing for some consistency in its play.The Gators, who won 15 in a
row last season, have not won
consecutive games this year.
"The consistency factor is obviously what
we're struggling with quite a bit," coach
Amanda Butler said. "This game, hope-
fully we'll see some more positive things
develop and then thankfully we'll have a
few days where we can actually practice
before we go into our next contest."
Today's game will mark the fourth
matchup in a week for UF, which means
the team hasn't had the luxury of consecu-
tive practices. After today's game, the teamwill be off until it plays Rutgers on Dec. 7.
"I think that's what we're really in need
of right now, is some practice time," Butler
said.
Players may be aching,
and physically and men-
tally exhausted, but they
know there's no rest for
the weary -especially if
the weary are to succeed.
"This is where the best
become the best, when
you're hurting and tired at practice," point
guard Lonnika Thompson said.In the small amount of practice time
the team had Saturday, the Gators em-
phasized beefing up the post game and
detracting from the notion that Florida's
only strength was outside shooting.
Senior Sharielle Smith said UF is ex-
ploring more options on offense, including
looking inside when coming off screens in-
stead of immediately scanning for shoot-
ers on the wing.
"Our practices are harder than a 40-min-
ute game," Smith said.
It worked against FIU when the team
