For the month of February, students have a 
new alternative to pay for Krishna Lunch. 
This year’s annual Bateman Case Study 
Competition, hosted by the Public Relations 
Students Society of America, has UF students 
rolling out a “What’s Your POPPING POINT” 
campaign. It is designed to increase the popu-larity of a new person-to-person payment ser-vice, Popmoney.
In an effort to integrate the new service into 
“the spirit of the university” as much as pos-sible, students in the campaign partnered with Krishna Lunch to test run Popmoney for the month, said Jessica Sheldon, a 21-year-old UF public relations senior.
“Krishna Lunch is a huge part of UF’s cul-
ture,” she said. “Part of the instructions in the competition brief was to incorporate the cul-ture of the university.”
The service works via the Popmoney web-
site or application on a smartphone or tablet and allows anyone with an Internet connection to pay for his or her lunch without needing to Students want UF popping dollars � A UF EXPERT SAID PEOPLE ARE

If cramming for midterms has you 
tearing your hair out, it might be time to 
call the stressed-out study buddy who’s suffering right there with you.
A new study published in Social Psy-
chological and Personality Science found that going through an anxiety-inducing situation with someone else who is just as worried about the situation can actu-ally reduce a person’s own stress level.
“I think often people feel like they’re 
the only one who feels something, feels a certain way,” said Linda Lewis, a men-tal health counselor at UF’s Counseling & Wellness Center. “It’s very comforting and helpful to know that you’re not the only one.”
To study this phenomenon, research-
ers from the University of Southern Cali-fornia, University of Leuven and Uni-
versity of California, Santa Barbara, told 
participants they were to give a speech, and then researchers partnered partici-pants based on how scared they were of public speaking. Misery loves company: People

The state’s denial of the City of 
Gainesville’s request to use the Reitz 
Union as an early voting center for next month’s municipal elections is drawing criticism locally.
The Reitz is a voting precinct for 
county, state and national elections. 
City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said the state legislature provided a very narrow range of places that are eligible.
“Although one of them sounds 
like the Reitz Union would ﬁ  t the deﬁ  nition, the state legislature said it did not,” he said. 
Hawkins said locations for early 
voting are the Millhopper Branch Li-brary and the supervisor of elections ofﬁ  ce downtown. 
“I don’t think that anyone is in-
tentionally trying to ostracize stu-dents,” he said, “but that’s the effect of it.”
On Nov. 6, 2012, the day of the 
national elections, 3,432 ballots were cast at the Reitz Union voting pre-cinct.
In a statement released Friday, 
Howard Simon, American Civil Liberties Union of Florida executive director, said the ACLU is “already looking into whether this attack on the voting rights of University of 
Florida students can also be chal-
lenged.”
UF Student Body President 
Christina Bonarrigo said Student Government supports early voting 
for students and having a location 
closer to campus.
“However, we understand there 
are state rules that govern elections, and we’re being cognizant of where 
(we can) and where we cannot have 
early voting locations,” she said. State rejects Reitz Union as an early voting center

Living Well ﬁ  tness center, where 
James Ogles has spent 12 years exer-
cising, will close its doors this June.
The database analyst in UF Col-
lege of Engineering, along with 
more than 200 Living Well faculty 
and staff members, will have to ﬁ  nd somewhere else to work out other than the Yon Hall center.
The close comes after budget 
woes and declining conditions of the gym equipment and facility. From 2012 to 2013, Living Well made $72,328 in total revenue and had 
$166,696 in total expenses, according 
to a Living Well ﬁ  nancial overview.
Michael B. Reid, College of Health and Human Performance dean, said the 30-year-old facility has run its course.
“It been a wonderful resource,” 
he said. “There hasn’t been enough money to repair it and keep it up to 
university standards.”  
To  accommodate faculty and 
staff, the College of Health and 
Human Performance and UF De-partment of Recreational Sports is making Living Well memberships transferable to a Rec Sports member-ship. Faculty and staff could work out at the Southwest Recreation 
Center and the Student Recreation 
and Fitness Center. Members who do not want to work out at the stu-dent gyms can be reimbursed for the unused share of their memberships. But Ogles, 56, said working out 
alongside students would not be the best option for him.
“As an older person, I would 
feel out of place going to a student center,” he said. “I’m a bit distressed 
about trying to ﬁ  gure out where I’m 
going to go. A lot of ﬁ  tness centers in town are not convenient for me, or else they are very expensive.”  
UF professor emeritus of archi-
tecture Ira Winarsky, 71, said Living Well has helped him and the faculty and staff at UF stay healthy.
“I’m concerned some of the fac-
ulty will just stop and won’t contin-ue to work out,” he said. “I’ve made friendships, and I don’t want to lose them. I’ve also become quite ﬁ  t and don’t want to lose that,  either.”UF faculty fitness center to close� A COMPANY HOPES 
TO DEVELOP A BLOOD TEST THAT CAN DETECT CONCUSSIONS.

A new award is helping 
fund research that could keep 
athletes out of the hospital and on the ﬁ  eld.
Alachua County-based 
company Banyan Biomark-ers announced it received a $300,000 award last month to continue research on a blood test that could detect a brain injury in 30 minutes.
The company is one of 
16 receiving an award from the General Electric-National Football League Head Health Challenge, according to a press release.
Banyan Biomarkers’ found-
er and president Ronald Hayes 
said the company, which is 
partially owned by UF, is working with the university’s 
football, women’s lacrosse and 
women’s soccer teams to see if a simple blood test can identify 
a brain injury and an athlete’s 
ability to return to the game.
“There are about 2 million 
brain injuries per year in the 
United States,” said Dr. Greg-
ory Murad, assistant professor 
in UF’s department of neuro-
surgery.
However, Hayes said the 
brain is the only organ that 
does not have a blood test to 
detect traumatic injury as of 
now. 
“If you had severe chest pain, you could go to the ER, 
and the ﬁ  rst thing they would do would be to take a blood 
test, which would show them 
if you were going to have a 
heart attack,” he said.
To perform the test, Hayes 
said researchers collect a blood 
sample from a brain injury vic-
tim. The sample then goes to a 
lab for processing to see if the blood has a protein level that could indicate a concussion.
Hayes said the company is 
working to create a test that could be completed on site instead of in a lab with the award, and the test will be 
used in emergency rooms after 
it’s fully developed.  
Murad, who is also an asso-
ciate residency program direc-
tor of neurosurgery, said he is 
excited about the impact this 
test could have on his depart-
ment.
“I take care of a lot of people 
with really bad brain injuries from things like car accidents,” 
he said. 
Bradley Fleming, a 22-year-
old Santa Fe College environ-
mental science junior, said the test could have been beneﬁ  cial after he suffered a concussion 
after hitting his head on a table 
when he was 10 years old.
A test like Banyan Biomark-
ers’ could possibly take the 
place of CAT or MRI scans and 
ultimately save hospitals time 
and money, Murad said.
“My hope is that it may 
have the ability to offer a prog-
nosis,” he said. “It would be 
great to tell how someone is 
going to do after a brain injury. 
It’s currently difﬁ  cult to tell.”County award to fund 
concussion researchcarry cash or a credit card.
By setting up a free person-to-person 
account, users can send and receive money 
without giving the other party their bank-
ing information. Sending money incurs a 95-cent fee, but receiving money is free.
Customers of certain banks, such as 
PNC and SunTrust, do not have to pay the fee, Sheldon said.
Krishna Lunch, which already accepts 
payments in the form of cash and credit cards, welcomed the new payment sys-
tem, said Caitanya Long, the vice presi-
dent of Krishna House and Krishna Lunch cashier. 
An added incentive to using Popmoney 
for Krishna Lunch is that it does not cost the organization anything, unlike Square, the current credit card reading service used by Krishna Lunch. Square keeps a percentage of each trans-
action, meaning that using a credit card to buy Krishna Lunch comes with a 14-cent upcharge for the customer.
A frequent customer of Krishna Lunch, 
Patrick Joseph, a 21-year-old UF family, youth and community sciences and crimi-nology senior, said he would use the new service.
“The line doesn’t get long enough usu-
ally where that would be completely nec-essary,” he said, “but that would be pretty cool.”
In addition to offering Popmoney at 
Krishna Lunch, students working on the campaign are hosting a Guinness World Record-breaking attempt on Feb. 25 in the Reitz ballroom, said Gillian Stoney, a 21-
year-old UF public relations senior. 
She said as a team, they hope to break 
the record for the most people popping

With one arm outstretched, 
he danced alone. His music was 
the clanging of blades, his chore-ography the steps and leaps of a fighter. His dance was the prepa-
ration for a duel.
The lone fencer was one of 250 
people preparing to fence in the 
48th annual Green Gator Fencing Tournament, the largest three-weapon tournament in Florida, which was held this weekend at Southwest Recreation Center.       
The UF fencing club, which 
hosted the event, set limits on 
the number of pre-registered par-
ticipants for the first time in the 
event’s history due to the build-
ing’s limited capacity.  
The tournament was open to 
all ages and allowed for competi-tion with three different types of weapons: the foil, épée and saber. 
“It was absolutely terrifying,” 
said Todd Kozlowski, a 21-year-old UF physics and astronomy ju-nior and the organizer of the tour-nament. “Only 86 showed up out of the 103 pre-registered (for the foil event), but it still far exceeded our expectations.”
Joseph Cohen, 68, from Phila-delphia, returned to fence in the 
tournament this year after win-
ning first place in the first Green Gator’s foil competition in 1966. He said he was impressed with the tournament’s growth.
“When I fenced in the first 
one, the highest competition was a C-ranked fencer, and there were maybe 20, 25 people in the com-petition,” said Cohen. “And now I come down here and see maybe 100 people in one event … there’s 
a fairly high caliber of fencing go-
ing on here.”
Madison-Lynn Haughie, who 
collected results and organized the direct elimination aspect of the tournament as head of Bout Committee, said she enjoyed the tournament despite working as administration.
“I get really excited seeing the 
bouts and the adrenaline,” said the 20-year-old UF national re-source conservation and telecom-munication junior. “It makes me wish I was fencing.”Hundreds fight for first in fencing tournament� LOCAL LEADERS

A UF alumnus’ company is taking the 
stress out of gift giving.
Founded in 2013, Blind Surprise allows us-
ers to treat themselves to a surprise gift every 
month or purchase a surprise gift for a friend.
Before purchasing a monthly subscription 
at blindsurprise.com, users are asked to fill 
out a questionnaire that details their interests or the interests of a friend. That questionnaire is then used to help select a custom gift box filled with one to three specialized gifts.
Josh Ludin, 24-year-old Blind Surprise co-
founder and UF graduate, said the gifts are made by artists and cannot be found at a local store.
“A lot of them are from Etsy or market-
places like that,” he said. “You can’t buy these 
gifts at like Target or Wal-Mart.”
Each month, Blind Surprise gift boxes fea-
ture about five new artists. Gift boxes can con-
tain up to three gifts worth about $30. Past gift boxes have included personalized wine tum-
blers and jewelry.
If a subscriber does not like a Blind Sur-
prise gift, they will be able to exchange it.
The company currently has about 230 sub-
scriptions a month.
Ali Kitenplon, Blind Surprise co-founder, said the company is also looking to cater to 
businesses in the future.
“Everyone loves gifts and surprises, but 
not everyone knows what to get for someone 
else,” she said.
Gift boxes are then wrapped and sent to 
the recipient along with a card and informa-
tion about the gift creators. Gifts are typically shipped out at the start of each month or on 
specific days if requested.
Katie Fry, a 20-year-old UF exploratory 
sophomore, said Blind Surprise is a very cre-
ative concept for gift giving.
“It’s definitely a cool gift idea for a friend,” 
she said.UF alum co-founds gift-giving subscription service

Participants were allowed to deliber-
ate with their partners before giving in-
dividual speeches. After the speeches, researchers found that participants who worked with a partner felt less anxious 
and experienced a significant reduction 
in a stress hormone called cortisol.
Lewis said grouping people who are 
undergoing similar experiences and stressors is the basis for many success-ful counseling programs. 
It is a common practice in mental 
health treatment, she said.
Stephanie Blitz, a 20-year-old UF 
criminology and psychology junior, said she prefers to take classes with friends because she finds it helpful to stress out together.
“It’s like the old German saying 
‘schadenfreude’ — you kind of get pleasure from seeing someone do worse than you,” she said. “Somebody gets your struggles.”However, while working with others 
might reduce stress for some individu-als, Lewis said coping mechanisms are different for everyone.
Amanda Novatnack, a 21-year-old 
UF psychology junior, said working in a group setting stresses her out even 
more.
“I actually hate studying with peo-
ple,” she said. “I get intimidated by 
people who grasp things faster than I do.”
Regardless of their preferred method 
of dealing with stress, students should be proactive about conquering anxiety, Lewis said. 
The Counseling & Wellness Center 
offers individual counseling, group therapy sessions and online therapy sessions via webcam.
“Don’t just wallow in your own 
stress and anxiety,” Lewis said. “There’s lots of ways to lower your stress, and there’s always a minute to figure out where you can go.”STRESS , from page 1“There’s a fairly high

about 600 people, 10 a.m. was not too early for a Mischievous Madams 
Burlesque Troupe performance.
The troupe opened for the fifth 
independently organized TED 
event at UF.
TEDxUF is based off the larger-
scale Technology Entertainment 
and Design conferences where 
speakers share their ideas and sto-
ries with mass audiences. The ta-
gline is “ideas worth spreading.”
Seven speakers took the stage 
Saturday to share their personal sto-
ries and discuss issues ranging from 3-D mapping to helping Haiti.
“I loved seeing how the talks 
connected together and how they each touched on the similar bigger theme of intersection,” said Jessica 
Watson, a 21-year-old UF public 
relations senior and TEDxUF public relations director.
The event, sponsored by UF Honors Program, UF Student Gov-ernment and the Center for Entre-preneurship and Innovation in the Warrington College of Business Administration, also featured a TEDxUF Lab full of booths display-ing various innovations.
UF Mad Scientists’ President 
Genevieve Comeau said the dis-
plays provided a way for people to 
share ideas with one another.
“We wanted to bring science to 
people who wouldn’t normally be exposed to it,” she said. “It’s impor-tant to showcase knowledge.”
The event also showed online 
videos of speakers from TED.com. Maria Carter’s conversation on 
embracing discomfort captured ev-
eryone’s attention, said Luca Bagli-oni, a 20-year-old UF management sophomore.
Carter spoke about how she has 
coped with a rare form of cancer for five years and said during the talk that she would rather die than have surgery.
“Her message was appealing to 
everybody,” Baglioni said. “You can really relate to her as a person. The whole event exceeded my ex-pectations.”TEDxUF brings talk of improv, inventions and inspirationSARA WILDER

Barefoot children, loud noises and bro-
ken boards would seem like a nightmare 
to most businesses, but that is exactly what Gainesville’s newest martial arts studio wanted.
PRO Martial Arts Gainesville held an 
open house for its grand opening Satur-day to give the community a taste of what classes and lessons are offered. The studio is part of a national program and is one of several martial arts studios in the city. The program’s grandmaster created a 
version of Korean martial arts formed by combining three types of karate: taekwon-do, tang soo do and hapkido, said PRO Martial Arts Gainesville owner Bill Wright. 
The instructors will also be teaching their 
students about moral lessons during their classes, which are available for all ages. 
“We are teaching life skills through the 
tagline of marital arts: building character 
for a lifetime,” Wright said. 
When looking for instructors, Wright 
said, he picked candidates who could 
would work well with kids. Parent Jackie Sarviwas said she thought 
he succeeded.
“They are very good with children,” 
Sarviwas said. “You can see they know how to bring them out of their shell.”
Sarviwas is the mother of 4-year-old 
Darwin, who is part of a long line of shy family members. He was shying away from the activities when the open house started but was soon jumping over a noodle then 
landing in a pose that made it seem like he already knew what he was doing: right fist 
on the mat, left arm straightened out to the side and body in a lunge to the right. 
Along with the physical aspect of mar-
tial arts, instructors will emphasize the importance of respect in their lessons, said chief instructor Corey Sparks.
The students are withheld from pro-
gressing if they don’t follow the respect and discipline rules, Sparks said. Students are not given their white belts until they have proven and demonstrated they are learning these skills.
“With respect we want to teach them 
how to respect and not necessarily that fighting is the cure to everything,” Sparks said. New martial arts studio combines three types of karate

UF students will soon have an un-
common opportunity.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau and Black 
History Month are bringing actor, singer 
and musician Common to the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts at 8 p.m. 
Thursday.
Accent chairman Daniel Landesberg 
said he thinks the show will appeal to everyone.
“Common is an actor, philanthropist, 
rapper,” the 21-year-old UF telecommu-nication senior said. “He’s a cool guy, in-teresting person and an entertainer.”
The artist will be speaking, perform-ing songs and holding a Q-and-A ses-sion. Common will be paid $38,000, which Landesberg said the artist might donate.
Landesberg said Common will be 
talking about his experiences as a black man, the causes he believes in and prob-
ably the entertainment industry.
Students can pick up two free tick-
ets per Gator 1 Card starting at noon 
Wednesday at the Phillips Center box office. 
The remaining tickets will be dis-
tributed to the general public at 5 p.m. Thursday. 
Marlene Azer, a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology sophomore, said she saw Com-mon perform on MTV for Black History Month.
“He’s a powerful person,” she said.

Gainesville Starbucks customers can 
drive through for their brew starting in a few 
months.
Butler Plaza announced in January the 
opening of a new Starbucks with a drive-thru, 
expected to open in late May next to Which 
Wich, Gigi’s Cupcakes and BurgerFi.
It will be the second Starbucks on Southwest 
Archer Road but the only one with a drive-thru. The current Starbucks location next to Panera Bread and Moe’s is listed for lease online.
Butler Enterprises spokeswoman Kristin 
Mamula wrote in an email that the plaza want-ed to give shoppers more than one choice to get 
their coffee.
“They can relax on the outside patio or nev-
er leave their car,” she said.
Just down the street from the site of the fu-
ture Starbucks is Bay Islands Coffee, a small 
drive-thru stand in the middle of a parking lot. It’s been open since 1997 and was the only drive-thru coffee shop in Butler Plaza, but gen-eral manager Jayme Brockman said the new store won’t affect his business. 
Brockman said that there is already a drive-
thru Dunkin’ Donuts across the street, so he doesn’t see the competition increasing at all. Brockman said his store has local appeal.
Tim Chong, a 22-year-old UF biochemistry 
senior, said the convenience is appealing, but he doesn’t see the need for two Starbucks loca-tions so close on Archer Road.
“My go-to place has been the drive-thru 
at Dunkin, but if I can skip the long lines at 
Starbucks, that’s definitely an option,” Chong 
said. “It’s odd to think there’s a Starbucks right across the street, though.”Drive-thru Starbucks brewing

“Our customers can have an 
option on how they would like to 
enjoy their Starbucks experience — 
they can relax on the outside patio 
or never leave their car.”

drive drunk
During the early hours of Sunday morning, a ﬁ  ery car 
crash on Interstate 275 in North Tampa resulted in the death of ﬁ  ve men — four of whom were University 
of South Florida students, according to NBC News. An un-identiﬁ  ed driver of a Ford Expedition was traveling south on 
the northbound side of the road and struck a Hyundai Sonata 
carrying the four USF students head-on. Authorities are inves-tigating whether the driver of the Expedition was under the inﬂ  uence of drugs or alcohol. Florida Highway Patrol said the driver of the SUV was a male in his early 20s, but they have so far been unable to identify the body due to severe burns.
Our hearts go out to the friends and families of the victims 
who, according to reports, did nothing wrong. The chilling message that arises from this crisis — and other drunken-
driving accidents across the country — is that you don’t have 
to be in the car with someone who’s drunk behind the wheel to be a victim.
This concept alone should force people to think twice be-
fore allowing a friend to drive home while intoxicated, but un-fortunately, it doesn’t. According to U.S. News, a University of Maryland School of Public Health survey found that one in ﬁ  ve college students admitted to having driven while drunk, and 43 percent of survey respondents said they’ve knowingly 
ridden with a drunken driver.
“Drinking and driving endangers the safety of not only the 
drinking driver and passengers but also other individuals on 
the road,” one co-author of the study said in a news release. “College students have limited driving experience, making drinking and driving possibly even more hazardous.”
Given the vast amount of resources available to prevent 
people from driving while drunk — in Gainesville alone we have SNAP for on-campus students and Later Gator buses 
for those who choose to imbibe in Midtown or downtown — 
it may be surprising that drunken driving continues to be a pervasive problem. Like shooting up heroin or having unpro-tected sex with a stranger, driving while intoxicated should be a no-brainer: Don’t do it.
But drunken driving is a cultural matter: How many times 
have you heard someone joke that they drive better while drunk or brag about how many times they’ve driven while drunk? Or, perhaps the most common, how often have you 
watched a friend stagger to his or her car after a long night 
while assuring his or her friends, “Nah guys, I’m good”?
Drunken driving, for whatever reason, is a point of pride, 
and unfortunately, no amount of tragic headlines, Mothers Against Drunk Driving campaigns or high-school driver’s ed courses will get through to the 18-to-24 demographic that’s so susceptible to drunken-driving accidents.
Drunken-driving prevention occurs on an individual level, 
like the drop-in-a-bucket theory. When you see a drunk friend, offer to drive him or her or offer to call a cab. If you are that friend, let yourself be helped by others. Your life — and the 
lives of other drivers on the road — are at stake.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Had you heard of 
Tiffany Sessions before this week?Today’s question: Should the Reitz Union be an early 
voting precinct?Real talk: Valentine’s Day sex isn’t special
If you Google “Valentine’s Day sex,” you’ll get about 
312 million results. That’s a lot of ideas.
And, to be honest, probably about 311.9 million of 
those ideas are really pointless. No offense to the Inter-net, but I can surprise my partner by wearing naughty lingerie any day of the year.
It seems like a lot of people have this idea that Valen-
tine’s Day sex is completely different from regular sex. 
But there is no law that says you can have really 
kinky, hot sex only on Valentine’s Day.
Unless you are, for some strange reason, using candy 
conversation hearts in your sexual encounter — and if 
you are, please let me know how and why — sex on Val-
entine’s Day is no different than sex on any other day.
I feel that couples often feel the need to make Valen-
tine’s Day special or more intimate. That’s a silly way of 
thinking. If you set your sights so high, you are bound 
to be disappointed.
Valentine’s Day is much like any other holiday in 
that the expectations are far greater than the reality. While New Year’s Eve never quite gives you the wild 
party you want, Valentine’s Day usually fails to deliver 
the simultaneous orgasm-and-cuddle combo that you are so desperately hoping for.
There is also no need to spice things up on Valen-
tine’s Day just because it’s a special day. 
The holiday doesn’t mean you have to break out the 
handcuffs or whips, unless that’s a kink you are actu-ally into.
If that’s the case, why wait until Friday to tell your 
partner you want to try something new? 
Good sex requires good communication all 365 days 
of the year.
But if you do want to try something new — great! 
The best thing about Valentine’s Day is that you can use it as the basis for starting a sexual discussion with your partner.I imagine it can be nerve-
wracking to tell your partner that you are really into BDSM 
or that you have a small-but-
totally-normal-please-don’t-think-I’m-weird foot fetish on a regular Tuesday. It might be 
easier to bring that up on a day 
that revolves around love and 
sex.
Just like with any sex act, make sure you and your 
partner discuss it ﬁ  rst. 
I don’t recommend springing anal sex or butt plugs, 
or any new thing for that matter, on him or her as a romantic surprise.
Get creative, though! Valentine’s Day is a fun holi-
day because instead of buying each other gifts, you can just exchange sexual favors. I’m a big fan of the cheesy coupons that you give for the other person to redeem.
Just make sure you are comfortable with the sex act 
you choose. For example, don’t choose to gift your part-
ner oral sex if, like Charlotte York, putting genitalia in 
your mouth tops the list of things you hate.
Your partner is going to enjoy the gift a lot more if he 
or she can tell you are also super into it.
I’m not saying your Valentine’s Day can’t be special 
— just remember that it doesn’t have to be. 
There are a lot of possibilities for spicing up your sex 
life on Valentine’s Day, but sometimes that also means a lot of pressure and stress.
It’s OK to just have plain, vanilla sex, just like it’s OK 
to have sex on a bed of roses or to celebrate by having a threesome.  
Just remember that there are 364 other days of the 
year to do those things, too.

Is Gov. Rick 
Scott so con-cerned about 
his chances at re-election that his appointees need to prevent early 
voting on UF’s 
campus? After the 
Florida’s Division of Elections announced last week that the Reitz couldn’t 
be an early voting location for 
Gainesville’s upcoming mu-
nicipal elections, it certainly appears that way. 
According to the Division 
of Elections, the Reitz doesn’t 
ﬁ  t into the proper deﬁ  nition 
of what qualiﬁ  es as an early voting location. Apparently, it needs to be either a “conven-
tion center” or a “government-
owned community center.” In 
the eyes of the state, the Reitz just doesn’t qualify. 
The last time I checked, UF 
is a public university, and Re-
itz holds conventions, so how 
exactly does the facility not meet the proper criteria? 
Let’s face it: This is all about 
politics and far more than the upcoming municipal elections. This is about Scott’s chances at winning re-election. While the decision affecting the Reitz only applies to the city elec-tions, one could presume that the Division of Elections will apply the same logic to the fall’s gubernatorial election. 
Regardless of its motiva-
tions, the early voting deci-sion is just one more attempt by the Scott administration to suppress voters, now and especially in November. Cre-ating roadblocks that block young people from voting in a Democratic-leaning city like Gainesville would certainly improve Scott’s tenuous path to re-election. 
Scott’s no fool. He’s seen 
his poll numbers, and as of today, they’re not particularly good. Last week, the Bob Gra-ham Center at UF released a poll that shows Scott trailing former Gov. Charlie Crist by seven points. The election is 
just fewer than nine months 
away, but those are lousy 
numbers for an incumbent governor.
If you’re struggling to tread 
water with the voters, what’s 
the best way to ensure victory 
on Election Day?
Keep people from voting.In 2012, Floridians spent 
hours upon hours waiting in 
line to vote, which was due 
in part to a law pushed by Re-publicans to tam-per Democratic turnout, especial-
ly during early 
voting periods. As a result, about 200,000 Florid-
ians decided not 
to vote. Jim Greer 
— the former 
Republican Party of Florida chairman — admitted to the 
Palm Beach Post that changes 
to early voting were necessary 
to help Republican candidates and prevent Democrats from casting ballots. 
So, let me get this straight:  
To keep Democrats from win-ning in 2012, Republicans pulled this trick in 2012 and still managed to lose the state 
to President Obama and now 
the Reitz decision?
It may have nothing to do 
with politics, and I could be a 
paranoid Democrat looking to 
accuse Republican boogeymen 
of voter suppression, but the 
evidence is fairly damning. 
The Division of Elections 
owes a real explanation to UF and residents of Gainesville regarding why the Reitz isn’t an acceptable early voting lo-cation because we all know its reasoning is garbage.
Sadly, that’s the trouble 
with far too many Republican candidates today. They lack appeal to young people, mi-norities, the LGBT community and numerous other groups, which is making it increas-ingly difﬁ  cult to win elections, especially in Florida. 
Given the changing de-
mographics, it’s making it increasingly hard for Repub-licans to compete in Florida and many other parts of the country. As a result, it appears some Republicans have given up broadening their messages and are choosing good old-fashioned voter suppression tactics instead. 
We saw it in 2011 when 
Republicans passed a massive law that was aimed at keeping thousands of Floridians from voting — and to keep Presi-
dent Obama from winning in 
2012 — and they’re at it again, 
this time focused squarely on UF and Gainesville. 
UF has a very strict policy 
on cheating. Perhaps it’s time 
we have a similar one for those 
who try to keep registered vot-ers from casting a ballot.

opinions@alligator.orgEver since the Internet came to be, 
we have been told not to be igno-rant of its dangers. While the most 
familiar warnings are about creepers and pedophiles prowling, most people are also warned about future employers.
However, I feel like some are ignoring the real 
horror of the Internet: excessive sharing. The reason for our fear should be that excessive sharing leads to loss of brain cells for the observing public.
Interestingly enough, after years of scrolling 
through social media, I have found these inappro-
priate posts typically fall into ﬁ  ve categories:
1. The Mama Drama
We all have dysfunctional families. To say that 
a normal family exists would be like saying uni-
corns are real — however much we would like these 
things to exist, they don’t. When someone goes on-line and rants about his or her mother’s brother’s second cousin twice removed who committed some heinous act to society, I want whack them over the 
head with an etiquette book — and maybe grab 
a bag of popcorn. Ultimately, these posts are like dirty laundry being left out. Putting your dirty laundry online is tacky, and it stinks up the Internet 
with the smell of mildew and desperation. Put your 
problems in the dryer like a normal person.
2. The DisneysWe cannot forget the would-be Disney princes 
and princesses of social media. These whippersnap-
pers have everything on their side: love, youth and, 
most importantly, each other. Now that the fairy tale is gone, the reality sets in. The Disneys will post their tumultuous love online for the world to see, 
thus taking away the validity of their relationship. 
Their relationship status will bounce from “Single” to “In a relationship” to “It’s complicated” to “Mar-ried” in the span of a single hour. The Disneys are a culture of teenyboppers who are more indecisive 
than Texas weather.
3. The Proud Parent
There are several ways in which mothers overly 
share information about their children. The main 
way is uploading so many pictures of their chil-
dren that they could create a stop-motion anima-tion from them. The child isn’t even doing anything interesting in these documented pictures — most of the time the baby is just lying there. Know the de-
mographic. In addition, I am so happy that you are 
so happy that your infant went No. 2, but I could not possibly care any less. If I cared any less, I would be a honey badger. Filter the excessive postings of the child, and I 
don’t mean ﬁ  lter with Instagram.
4. The Instigator
The Instigator is the equivalent of ﬁ  ghting with 
marshmallows for boxing gloves. This person seeks confrontation in the most passive way possible. It 
begins with a vague — yet obviously intended for one person — post where the person addresses the anger he or she feels for a particular person. After followers of the Instigator question “What hap-
pened?” or “Who did that?” this person will typi-
cally follow up with an excruciatingly long status in which they will explain this particular dramatic sit-uation with extensively tacky detail. This incident 
usually ends in one of two ways: either the Instiga-
tor completes the post by tagging this opponent so that they may see, or the unseen opponent emerges from the sidelines to defend himself or herself, aid-ing in making the situation even tackier.
5. The Spiritual OneSo before everyone begins grabbing their pitch-
forks and religious reference books of choice to hurl at my face — hear me out. I have absolutely 
no problem when someone expresses his or her re-
ligious beliefs. However, I do have an issue with individuals making a wish list online and ending it with “amen.”
“Dear God, this month has been really difﬁ  cult 
for me. (Insert extended list of problems.) I would really love it if you would grace me with your love… and $500 — I really need to make rent this month. Also, if you could send me a man to snuggle 
and play with, that would be great.”
Religious entities are not Santa Claus. This per-
son is not praying to God. They are searching for 
attention and for someone to comment and say, “I’m keeping you in my prayers.” The crazy thing is 
that the Spiritual One’s followers eat this up more 
quickly than festive cookies. God is not more likely to answer your prayers if you include an emoticon with two hands clasped together in a prayer follow-
ing the post. Please don’t throw holy water on me.
So the next time that you are thinking about post-
ing a tweet, Facebook status or Instagram photo, 
think of the people who have to see what you post. Have mercy on them.

UF students may have paid for credits they already 
earned in high school because the university said it didn’t know it was violating a statewide regulation. It fixed the error by accepting the 45-credit standard 
Florida put into effect three years beforehand, up 15 
from what believed was policy. About 3,200 students were notified, and the credits were adjusted for the then-freshman class. The university was not penal-ized for failing to implement the policy.

Four quarter-pound containers of TNT, a bag 
of smokeless powder and a container of peroxide 
smokeless powder — items used to craft explosive 
materials — were stolen from an off-duty Alachua County Sheriff officer’s vehicle. The materials them-selves couldn’t produce a bomb, said then-ASO spokesman Keith Faulk, but in expert hands could become dangerous. Other items taken include a 12-gauge shotgun and a bulletproof vest. “(The thief) has the explosive part but needs an igniter,” Faulk said. “He needs two other components that would be hard 
to get his hands on. He definitely wouldn’t be able to 
walk into a hardware store and find what he needs.”

In a region of churches and 
congregations, Florida has taken 
a step back from organized reli-
gion.
A recently released Gallup poll 
found that about 29 percent of 
Floridians identified themselves 
as non-religious and said they 
seldom or never attend religious services.
The number is a striking con-
trast with Florida’s geographic 
neighbors, as 10 out of the 11 most 
religious states are in the South, according to poll results.David Hackett, a UF associate 
professor of religion, said the con-
trast in the strength of religious 
identification between Floridians and other Southerners did not come as a surprise.
“Florida has never been a South-
ern state. Florida has always been an extension of the Northeast,” he said. “People come here from the Northeast or South America. It’s 
rare to find someone born here.”
Hackett said the mobility of 
Floridians is a primary cause for 
the lack of faith affiliation.
“With their willingness to move 
around from place to place comes a separation from the religions of their upbringing,” he said. “Flori-da’s just participating in the basic 
tradition — a movement away 
from organized religion and to-wards spirituality.”
Jenna Gallas, a 19-year-old UF 
health science freshman, said al-
though she doesn’t have an affilia-
tion with any religion, she doesn’t necessarily see herself as agnostic or atheist.
“I’d like there to be a god, but 
the science side just makes more sense to me,” she said. “I’m just confused.”
Despite the high percentage of 
Floridians who have turned away from organized religion, many still engage in traditional religious practices, said Kenneth Wald, a 
UF political science professor.
“A lot of people identify 
themselves by thinking that to 
be religious means to belong to a religious community,” he said.  
“When you actually discuss their 
religious behavior, they do things that are traditionally religious — they believe in God, they pray.”
Jacob Zieper, an 18-year-old 
UF Jewish studies freshman, said he finds it hard to imagine a life without his faith. 
He said as far as he can remem-
ber, no one in his family has left the Jewish faith. “I’ve never really had any 
doubts about it,” Zieper said. “I’m 
pretty good where I am.”
Poll shows about one-third of Floridians identify as non-religious
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ELLENTON, Fla. — The 
talents of a Florida figure skat-
ing coach and a seamstress are on display for the world at the Sochi Olympics.
Seamstress Dawn Impera-
tore and coach Jim Peterson designed and constructed 12 costumes to be worn by three skating pairs who train at the Ellenton Ice and Sports Com-plex in southwest Florida.
Peterson coaches U.S. skat-
ers Nathan Bartholomay and Felicia Zhang as well as Da-vid King and Stacey Kemp of Great Britain. Imperatore also created costumes for Canadi-ans Rudi Swiegers and Paige Lawrence.
The Sarasota Herald-Tri-bune reports Peterson selects the music, choreographs rou-tines and helps Imperatore with costume design. 
He recently sat in a small 
sewing room above the ice rink for hours, meticulously securing 1,440 crystals to the costume with a toothpick and glue.
“He’s very, very talent-
ed, and he leaves nothing to chance,” Imperatore says. “He eats, drinks and breathes fig-ure skating.”
Imperatore, who started 
sewing when she was 9 years old, has spent more than 200 hours on the 12 Olympic cos-tumes. 
She even takes them home 
and washes them because the 
solvent used at the dry clean-
ers will dissolve the glue used on the costumes.
She says it’s “really cool” to 
think the same costumes that were recently drying on her shower rod at home will be viewed by millions around the 
world.
The costumes not only 
need to match the music and 
the characters but be flexible enough to hold up to rigorous wear. Points are deducted if something falls off a costume.
“I’m not like these com-
mercial retailers,” Imperatore says. “I do it because I love 
these kids.”Florida seamstress, coach’s

Researchers from the Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences 
at UF have discovered the genetic cause of citrus canker, a contagious disease caused by bacteria that in-
fects citrus trees and makes them 
lose their fruit and leaves early, which may lead to a cure.
Jeff Jones, a UF professor in 
plant pathology, and his assistant Yang Hu were part of the team that discovered the gene that cit-rus canker bacteria, Xanthomonas citri, targets. 
“We have now found the sus-
ceptible gene, the major gene that can sense the bacteria pathogens,” Hu said. 
The goal is to discover if there 
are ways to modify the susceptible gene that will make more citrus resistant to Xanthomonas and re-
lated bacteria, he said.   
That’s good news for grow-
ers who want their crops to look 
presentable, said Matthew Salois, economic and market research di-rector for the Florida Department of Citrus.
Hu said canker, though highly 
contagious, is mostly controlled in Florida.UF researchers discover

Scottie Wilbekin drives the ball down the court during Florida’s 78-69 win against Alabama on Saturday in the 
O’Connell Center. Wilbekin and the Florida defense allowed Alabama to shoot 55 percent from the floor.
� GAME WAS TIED AT HALF -
TIME.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
By the end of No. 3 Florida’s 
78-69 win over Alabama on Sat-
urday coach Billy Donovan didn’t 
need many words to describe his 
team’s defense.
“I thought we were bad the 
whole game,” Donovan grum-
bled.
Despite the Gators’ (21-2, 10-0 
Southeastern Conference) nine-
point victory, they struggled to contain the Crimson Tide’s (9-14, 3-7 SEC) Trevor Releford, whose 25 points were the most 
against Florida since Kansas’ An-
drew Wiggins dropped 26 in the O’Connell Center on Dec. 10.
Releford’s 16 first-half points 
helped Bama lead by seven with 
5:49 left in the first half, which was the biggest lead by a visit-ing Florida opponent since Wig-
gins and his Jayhawks also led by seven in the first half against the Gators.
Coming into Saturday’s match-
up, Donovan said he wanted to focus on two things to prevent an upset loss at home, where Florida has now won 29 straight.
“The thing I was most con-
cerned about going into the game was two things: Releford, and obviously my concern didn’t do 
too much because the guy had 25, 
and the other concern I had was the three-point line,” Donovan said.
The Gators gave up five threes 
to the Crimson Tide in the first half, which was the most they have surrendered in the first 20 minutes since visiting Auburn on 
Jan. 18.
The only reason Florida 
walked off the court at the half 
tied with Alabama at 36 was be-cause senior Will Yeguete scored 
six points in just more than two 
minutes to close out the half.
Senior Scottie Wilbekin said 
the Gators struggled out of the 
gate because they let off the gas 
against the Crimson Tide, which Wilbekin said gave its best effort Defense struggles in

Lauren Haeger had a tough time 
against Wisconsin in the sixth inning on 
Sunday.
After striking out seven batters 
through the first five innings, the ju-nior right-handed pitcher walked three Wisconsin batters after Nyah Rodman 
reached first base on a fielding error, al-
lowing the Badgers to get their first run of the game.
But Haeger rebounded in the sev-
enth, striking out two of the final three batters en route to her first career solo no-hitter and a 5-1 victory for No. 4 
Florida to start its final day in Tampa. 
“She was throwing the ball hard, 
and I thought her location was good,” 
coach Tim Walton said in a release. “She 
looked like she was pitching; she didn’t look like she was throw-
ing. … I thought she was probably the 
better of the four pitchers.”

For the first time in nine years, the Gators 
swept the Wildcats.
On Sunday afternoon in the O’Connell Cen-
ter, Florida (17-7, 7-4 Southeastern Conference) 
defeated No. 15 Kentucky (17-6 5-5 SEC) for the 
second time in as many games this season, 86-
80. 
“Really proud of the way that we played,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. 
“The intangibles were things that separated 
us today. We maintained a steady level of con-fidence that the next thing that happened was going to be good and we were going to make our plays, whatever that meant for each indi-
vidual.”
Big second-half performances from Kayla 
Lewis, January Miller and Lily Svete were in-
tegral in the Gators’ victory, as they scored a combined 40 of Florida’s 46 second-half points. Miller led the team with 20 points. Her consecutive three-point plays early in 
the second half fueled Florida to a 14-point lead 
with 16:13 remaining in the game. 
“Jan had big, big min-
utes, hit big shots,” Butler 
said. “She was someone we could really rely on today of-fensively.”
Miller has a penchant 
for drawing fouls, thanks to her aggressive drives to the 
basket coupled with the oc-
casional shot from beyond 
the arc.
“Growing up, I was used to drawing a lot 
of fouls,” she said. “I’m used to finishing on the play. The three-pointers help to mix it up because they don’t know what you’re going to do.”

January Miller drives toward the net during Florida’s 87-69 win against Auburn on Jan. 26 in the O’Connell 
Center. Miller led Florida with 20 points against Kentucky in an 86-80 win on Sunday.
Gators off to perfect start to season
career, Haeger tied her career high 
by notching 11 strikeouts against Wisconsin (2-2). The Peoria, Ariz., 
native has 18 strikeouts and a 1.08 
ERA in 13 innings this season.
Florida followed its victory 
against Wisconsin by shutting out 
Bethune-Cookman 8-0 in five in-
nings to cap its sweep at the USF Wilson-DeMarini Tournament. 
“I thought that as a team, we 
played pretty well together,” Wal-
ton said. “You really can’t get too 
overly critical on the first weekend. Six wins was the goal and that’s what we were able to accomplish.”
Freshman Delanie Gourley, 
making her second career start, held the Wildcats (0-5) to one hit in four innings pitched while striking 
out five of the 15 batters she faced.
In the three games she played 
in during the tournament, includ-
ing Florida’s 9-4 win against No. 5 
Michigan in extra innings on Satur-day, the left-handed pitcher struck 
out 12 batters and only walked two on her way to starting her collegiate career with two wins and a save.
The Gators (6-0) scored all eight 
of their runs against the Wildcats during the second inning. Senior Stephanie Tofft, who was hitting just .083 before she stepped up to 
the plate against Bethune-Cook-
man, hit a home run to right field to start the Gators’ rally.
Sophomore Kelsey Stewart led 
the team with four RBIs on Sunday, hitting a two-run home run in the fourth inning against Wisconsin and a two-RBI single against Bet-hune-Cookman. 
The second baseman logged a 
hit in five of Florida’s games on the USF Softball Field.
The Gators leave Tampa after 
winning their games by a combined score of 40-13.
Sophomore Taylor Schwarz, 
who finished last season batting .266, leads Florida batters who have 
at least 10 at-bats with a .500 batting average, eight RBIs and two home 
runs.
Sophomore Aubree Munro also 
had a breakout weekend in Tampa. 
The Brea, Calif., native leads the 
team with three doubles while hit-ting .400 and seven RBIs.
After playing six straight games 
on the road, Florida will play its 
first home game on Wednesday, 
facing Jacksonville University at 6 p.m. 
Despite the team’s strong per-
formance, Walton believes the team has room for improvement as the season moves along.
 “The biggest question marks for 
me as a coach is what kind of of-
fense are we going to run and run 
consistently,” Walton said. 
“Even though we scored quite 
a few runs this weekend, my only 
frustration was the lack of consis-
tency offensively from our whole team. We had some really special individual efforts, but as a team, I thought that offensively we were 
just OK.”SoFt , from page 12Miller scored 20 points
do on Sunday was feed Svete three-
point shots. 
The Gators did that successfully 
— Svete scored a career-high 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting.
“You want to think that when 
you’re at home, you’re really going to light it up if you get good looks,” Butler said. “Lily took advantage of that.”
Svete tied a career-high with five 
three-pointers made. Her most cru-cial shot came with 3:34 left in the game when she drained her final 
three to put Florida ahead 76-72.
“My job on the team is to get my-
self open and get ready for shots,” 
Svete said. 
“When my team passes it to me, 
I’m expected to shoot it. I didn’t let my confidence get down when I missed my first couple.”
Added Butler: “Everybody wants 
Lily to shoot when she’s open. I loved the resilient attitude that she had.”
However, the biggest play of the 
game came when the Gators were on defense.
With 1:10 remaining in the game 
and Florida only up by three, senior Jaterra Bonds took a charge from Kentucky guard Bria Goss that gave the Gators the basketball. Lewis then made a layup with 46 seconds 
remaining to put Florida up by five.
“Huge,” Butler said of Bonds’ 
charge. “Without having a chance to 
look at the film yet, I would have to say it was the play of the game.” 
The Gators redeemed themselves 
on Sunday after a poor showing against Arkansas on Thursday. 
Compared to their 37.5 percent 
shooting effort against the Razor-backs, the Gators shot an impressive 48.4 percent from the field as well as going 9 for 20 from three-point range against the Wildcats. 
“Maybe we were impacted at Ar-
kansas by not hitting a few (shots) early,” Butler said. 
“Today, we came out of the gate 
and made a couple of offensive plays early that made us confident about the next thing.”
Florida enters a mid-week bye 
with a victory over a ranked oppo-nent in Kentucky. Now, it has ample time to prepare for Sunday’s match-up against Georgia, which beat UF 68-62 in the O’Connell Center three 
weeks ago.
“We definitely want to get Geor-
gia back,” Svete said. 
“They came in here and beat us 
at our place, so we want some re-
venge.”w-hooPS , from page 12
Releford hit 4 of 6 three pointers against laboring UF defense
because it was facing a top-five team.
Wilbekin added that Florida didn’t 
help its cause any by letting Releford con-
trol the floor by hitting 4 of 6 threes in the 
game.
“We let him get open,” the point guard 
said. “He made some tough ones, but for 
the threes we lost him and he capitalized. 
Teams have good nights and their record doesn’t always show how good they are. You can’t judge a team by its record all the time.”
Florida, which extended its winning 
streak to 15 games Saturday, made up for 
its poor defensive showing by stepping up 
on offense.
All five of the squad’s starters finished 
with double-digit points for the first time since defeating Middle Tennessee State 79-
59 on Nov. 21, 2013. 
Wilbekin led his team with 16, but fel-
low senior Casey Prather was not too far behind.
The 6-foot-6 forward, who hasn’t scored 
double digits since Jan. 30 against Missis-
sippi State, played like he did earlier in the 
season by hitting 7 of 11 shots to finish the 
game with 15 points.
Donovan said Prather’s left ankle injury 
almost took the senior out of the lineup. Prather has a difficult time mentally deal-
ing with injuries because anything that 
limits his full potential frustrates him, Donovan added.But the 18th-year coach left the decision 
up to Prather, and the senior said he could go.
“When he knows he can do things 
physically, it just adds to his confidence,” Donovan said. “It’s got nothing to do with him making shots. 
“It’s got to do with him moving. When 
he can’t move like he wants to move, I 
think he knows he’s putting our team in 
jeopardy. And I think that eats him alive and kills him.”hooPS , from page 12� FRESHMAN SCORED FOUR 
POINTS IN FOUR MINUTES.LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Coach Billy Donovan was unsure Satur-
day morning if Casey Prather (ankle) would 
play against Alabama and left the decision in the senior forward’s hands.
Prather wanted to give it a go. It turns out 
he was just fine. 
In 33 minutes on the floor during the No. 
3 Gators’ 78-69 win against the Crimson Tide on Saturday in the O’Connell Center, Prather recorded 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting, six re-bounds, three assists and no turnovers.
“It was not too bad,” Prather said of his 
minor ankle sprain. “For the most part, I didn’t really notice it.”
The 6-foot-6 senior had been dealing with 
the injury for more than a week and missed a few days of practice last week because of it.
After a five-point performance against 
Missouri on Tuesday, Prather saw his streak of 18 consecutive games of double-figure scoring snap. The injury clearly affected his mobility during the contest.
“When he knows he can do things physi-
cally, it just adds to his confidence,” Donovan said. 
“It has nothing to do with him making 
shots. It has to do with him moving. When he can’t move like he wants to move, I think he knows he’s putting our team in jeopardy. I think that eats him alive and kills him.”
But after Saturday, the Gators see Prather 
returning back to form. 
“His ankle … he’s still babying that a little 
bit,” senior center Patric Young said.
 “It’s not where he would like it to be, but 
he comes out here and he’s still going to play 
hard.
“It was good to see him dunk the ball and 
be explosive. We’re going to need that the 
whole season.”
Walker’s second game: For the second 
straight contest, Chris Walker did not see sig-nificant minutes on the floor. 
And once again, all of his points came 
close to the rim.During Florida’s victory against Alabama, 
Walker played only four minutes but scored four points on 2-of-3 shooting and grabbed two rebounds. 
The freshman forward did not check into 
the game until 9:19 in the first half — this time to much lighter cheers than during his first 
moments on the floor in his seven-minute 
Florida debut against Missouri last Tuesday.
On his first two defensive possessions, 
Walker struggled defending Alabama’s big men in the post as Jimmie Taylor and Levi Randolph scored layups off the glass over him during an 8-0 run by the Tide. The Boni-fay native was then subbed out at the 7:04 mark.
But Walker, who checked into the second 
half after sitting the first 7:40 of the period, made an impact for the Gators during their 17-3 run in the second half that helped them to a 56-44 lead with 10:33 remaining. 
During his first play of the half, Walker 
tipped in a Kasey Hill lob to help the Gators to an eight-point lead. 
The play was a familiar scene — in his UF 
debut against Missouri, Walker’s four points came on two alley-oop dunks from Hill pass-es.
Two plays later, Dorian Finney-Smith 
sent a bounce pass Walker’s way for a two-handed flush.
But at times during Saturday afternoon’s 
contest, Walker looked flustered in the post and confused during some of Florida’s offen-
sive sets. Donovan admitted after the game 
he should give Walker — along with Hill and DeVon Walker — more minutes in the future.
“This was a hard game for Chris because 
they’re playing zone, and there’s things you want to run against a zone,” Donovan said. 
“He’s not all caught up on our zone offense. 
You get pretty simplistic when he’s out there. When they switched and went man-to-man, we put him out there. Against man, he did a pretty good job. 
“But we need some of our younger guys 
to grow a little bit faster than they are right now. Maybe that’s a little bit unfair to them, 
but that would help our team.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2014

Florida got off to a shaky start dur-
ing the first round of its first three-day 
spring tournament.
The Gators shot 298 (+14) Sunday in 
the 2014 Northrop Grumman Regional 
in Palos Verdes, Calif. and are currently 
ninth out of 16 teams after Day 1 of the tournament. 
Unranked Baylor sits in first place 
with a score of 286 with No. 1 USC two strokes behind.
 “We got off to a slow start today and 
it was hard to recover,” coach Emily Glaser said in a release. “The front nine, 
our back nine, played more difficult, 
so we were not able to make up many shots after our start. “
Palos Verdes veteran Camilla Hed-
berg earned the same first round score she did in Round 1 of the 2013 Northrop Grumman Regional, where she finished in eighth place. She led her teammates on the first day of competition, ending 
even-par (71) after shooting five birdies. 
The junior is tied for sixth place with 
nine other players, including top-ranked 
UCLA golfer Alison Lee.
Junior Sarah Schober and freshman Maria Torres had moderately successful days on the course, shooting three bird-ies each to tie each other and six other players for 16th place at one-over (72). 
“Overall, we were not happy with 
the team score, but there were some 
positives” Glaser said. “Camilla, Maria 
and Sarah had nice rounds and had a bunch of good birdie looks.”
Redshirt sophomore 
Katie Mitchell ended the day with a score of 76 (+5), despite hitting a 
double bogey, while freshman Karolina Vlckova shot a round of 79 (+8) in her 
Palos Verdes debut.
Senior Elcin Ulu, who was first in the 
lineup after placing fourth in her senior-
season debut, sits sixth from the bottom of the leaderboard at the end of Day 1 with a score of 82 (+11).
Florida will have the chance to im-
prove its place in the standings with two more rounds of competition ahead of it. 
Despite the slow start, the Gators are 
confident in their ability to remain com-petitive and climb the leaderboard. 
“This team is very talented and I 
see them improving,” Glaser said. “We have two more days and we will fight hard.”UF struggling in CaliforniaLAcroSSE

There is only one player remaining from 
Florida’s inaugural 2010 class.
That final player is redshirt senior goal-
keeper Cara Canington, who is just one of 
two seniors that help lead the team of 11 freshman, 10 sophomores and four juniors.
Canington put her senior status to good 
use Saturday. The Bel Air, Md., native worked to keep No. 4 Florida in the game during its 20-8 loss to No. 1 North Carolina (1-0), by blocking 13 shots — her second-highest number of blocks in a game since 
2010 when she blocked 14 shots against 
Johns Hopkins. 
She allowed only 12 points before coach 
Amanda O’Leary subbed her out of the 
game with 13:24 remaining.
O’Leary said Canington’s performance 
allowed the Gators to stay in the game and 
kept them only four points away from tying it up at halftime.
Although Canington is the only player 
from the 2010 class still on the team, she is not the only goalkeeper. Sophomore goalkeeper Mary-Sean Wil-
cox is efficient on goal, but the experience 
that Canington brings to the cage will be 
helpful for the young Gators as the freshmen begin to find their identity on the field.
O’Leary noted the dif-
ference in experience be-
tween Wilcox and Can-
ington on Saturday after Florida’s loss to UNC, but she felt that the goalkeeper 
position was solid no mat-ter the player.
“Mary-Sean came in 
under a really tough situation,” O’Leary said. 
“I think we’re really solid there [in 
goal].
Wilcox made appearances in 11 games in 
2013 and totaled 21 saves against 16 goals 
during her freshman season. However, Wil-
cox’s career high for saves in a game is six —  fewer than half of Canington’s career high of 14.

season and redshirted.Senior goalkeeper provides

After ending one streak, the 
Gators refused to begin a new, less 
appealing one.
On Sunday, No. 2 Florida 
avoided losing two games in a row a day after its four-game winning streak came to a close..
The Gators beat No. 6 South-
ern California 4-1 on the third day of the National Team Indoors. The win came against the high-est ranked opponent Florida has played this season and increased UF’s record to 2-1 in the tourna-ment.
“I told [the team] that this was 
about as proud as I’ve been of any team,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“To be able to make this turn-
around, to take ownership of [Sat-urday] by responding to adversity today, it makes a coach really, re-ally proud.”
Florida began the match where 
it has many times this season: struggling slightly in doubles and then dominating singles play.
For the fourth time this season, 
each duo in Florida’s doubles pair-
ings consisted of a senior and a 
freshman. Alex Cercone and Ste-
fani Stojic began doubles play with a 6-2 loss, but Olivia Janowicz and Kourtney Keegan kept the Gators’ 
hopes alive with a 6-3 victory. Sofie 
Oyen and Belinda Woolcock were 
not able to pull through in the fi-nal set, losing 7-5 and yielding the doubles point to USC.
After losing the doubles point a day earlier against Northwestern, the Gators could not overcome the deficit and struggled the rest of the way. 
But Sunday was a different 
story. 
After losing the doubles point, 
Florida rattled off four straight wins in singles to take the match.
Keegan, Cercone, and Brianna 
Morgan won in straight sets and Janowicz won a close match at the one spot 2-6, 6-4, 10-6. Cercone was credited with the clincher, winning 7-5, 6-1 to capture Florida’s sixth win of the season.
“We talked last night and chal-
lenged our team to be more resil-ient and courageous in their play,” Thornqvist said. “[Today] was one of those moments where the team could have just folded up and given up, but I have to say this is a top-10 moment for this team to battle back and win four straight singles matches in the way we did against one of the best teams in the country.”
Entering the National Team In-
doors, the Gators knew they had to elevate their doubles play to com-pete with the talent-level at the 
competition. Florida won its first 
match of the tournament against 
host Virginia 4-2, but it would have lost the doubles point if not for Woolcock and Oyen’s late rally 
to win the decider.
After falling behind in doubles 
again against Northwestern on 
Saturday, Florida could not pull out another comeback and was swept in doubles play. UF went on to lose in a 4-2 quarterfinal upset. 
However, Sunday’s bounceback 
win was a huge milestone for the freshman-laden Gators, who have a week off before playing Florida State on Feb. 18.
“Winning this match in the way 
we did made coming to this tour-nament a huge success,” Thorn-qvist said. “It could have been a devastating event for us. This team managed to turn this trip into a huge success and I’m hoping it will pay huge dividends down the stretch.”

On the final day of the Doc Hale Virginia Tech 
Elite Meet in Blacksburg, Va., the field stole the 
show once again after taking the spotlight during 
Day 1.
Throwing his way into the UF track and field in-
door top-10 list, Stipe Zunic tossed for a career-best 
shot-put performance of 18.57 meters.
Zunic’s throw placed him seventh all-time in 
Gators history — behind John Turco (18.78m) — and he finished third overall at the VT Elite Meet. 
Alongside Zunic’s career day, junior jumper 
Marquis Dendy added to the Gators’ success with a season-best triple jump of 14.69 meters, which beat his mark of 14.46 at the Razorback Invitational on Feb. 1 .
“(I’m) pleased because Stipe and Marquis got 
better this weekend,” coach Mike Holloway said in a release. 
“I’m proud of coach (Steve) Lemke and coach 
(Nic) Petersen, who have done a really good job with them.”
Making his season debut, junior sprinter Dedric 
Dukes capped off his day with a first-place victory in the 200-meter dash, clocking a time of 20.93.
With his career-best performance in the 60-me-
ter dash (6.79) Friday, Dukes leaves the VT Elite Meet with two top performances.
Holloway said he was pleased with Dukes in his 
season opener last weekend and feels Dukes is in a good spot so far. 
The Gators will depart from the VT Elite Meet 
with five career-best performances from Jayla Bos-tic (weight throw), Jared Watkins (pole vault), Da-vid Levin (weight throw), Dukes (60m) and Zunic (shot put).
In addition, Dendy, Dukes and Ciarra Brewer 
all turned in season-best performances.
Upcoming on the agenda, the Gators will get 
their first glimpse of the Gilliam Indoor Track Sta-dium in College Station, Texas, at the Texas A&M 
Invitational, where the Aggies will host the 2014 
Southeastern Conference Indoor Championships.  
The men’s team finished second at the SEC meet 
last year in Fayetteville, Ark., while the women fin-ished fourth.
“We have some bigger competitions coming 
down the road,” Holloway said “We’re getting fo-cused on being our best when it counts at the end of the year.”Zunic notches career-best shot

When Bridget Sloan sets a goal for 
herself, she achieves it. 
During Florida’s meet against Ken-
tucky on Friday — the midway point of 
the regular season — Sloan achieved her 
goal of landing a perfect 10 on balance 
beam.
“She was very serious about getting a 
10 on beam,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “When she did the routine, we all knew that it was perfect. There was no error. It was such an amazing routine and so worthy of a 10.”
Sloan’s 10 on beam 
has been a long time 
coming. The sopho-more has consistently improved her beam scores since the start of the season with one goal in mind: getting a 10 on what she consid-ers her best event.
Sloan started the season with a 9.225 
on beam against UCLA, then it was a 9.925, 9.90 and ﬁ  nally against Oklahoma on Jan. 31, she got the closest she’s been this season to a perfect beam with a 9.95.
“Floor is a good event for me, but I’m 
really pushing for a 10 on beam,” Sloan said on Jan. 24, after she scored her ﬁ  rst 10 of the season on ﬂ  oor.
Sloan led Florida 197.175 to 195.450 
win against Kentucky. The 1.725 differ-ence is the largest margin Florida has won with so far this season.
“It was one of those nights,” Sloan 
said. “It was like a fairy tale.”
Sloan’s mother, father and three older 
siblings traveled from Indiana and were on hand to witness her historic perfor-
mance.“I was very relaxed,” Sloan said. 
“They were really just playing the music 
perfect. I felt like we were back at prac-tice.”
Now that Sloan has achieved a 10 on 
beam, she said her new, more immedi-
ate goals are to stay healthy, maintain the 
right state of mind for competition and get a 10 on bars.
“I’m deﬁ  nitely trying for a 10 on all 
four (events),” Sloan said. “You got to have goals.”
While Sloan found glory on the beam, 
her teammate and perfect-10-on-ﬂ  oor twin, Kytra Hunter, stumbled. The junior 
wobbled during her beam and scored a 
9.750 — the lowest beam performance of the night from the Florida lineup.
Though Sloan was ﬁ  fth and Hunter 
was fourth in the beam lineup, she said Hunter’s performance did not throw her off her game.
“When I get up on the event, it’s my 
event,” Sloan said. “I’m able to block out 
whatever happened.”
Besides the low note she hit on beam, 
Hunter had a successful meet against 
Kentucky. She placed second to Sloan (39.675) in all around with a 39.425. Hunter won the ﬂ  oor (9.925) and vault (9.925) events while Sloan’s 10 secured her a win on beam and her 9.90 on bars tied her with senior Mackenzie Caquatto 
for her second event win of the night.
The last time a Gator achieved a 10 
on beam was almost a decade ago. On Feb. 27, 2004, Kristen Stucky stuck a 10 
on beam against Kentucky in Lexington, Ky. Stucky’s 10 is the only other 10 on beam in the history of UF gymnastics.
“It’s so kind of awesomely eerie,” 
Faehn said.
