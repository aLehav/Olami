CRIME� 32 PERCENT GET DRUGS 
WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION.
STEPHANIE BAGUIDY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although roughly seven out of 
every 10 college students polled 
recently said sharing prescription drugs was common, a UF counsel-or said the amount of UF students doing so is low.
A poll by Zogby Analytics 
for the Digital Citizens Alliance showed 71 percent of 366 students said sharing of prescription drugs was slightly or very usual among their classmates. Roughly 30 per-cent said they or their friends had taken prescription medications to help them study for ﬁ  nals.
But GatorWell Director Mau-
reen Miller said that on the whole, the percentage and prevalence rates of students at UF abusing prescrip-tion drugs are low. “I heard of sharing prescription 
drugs, but I never thought of using them,” said 21-year-old UF pub-lic relations sophomore Andrea Cepeda. “I feel like if they’re not prescribed by a doctor for you, then you don’t really need them.”
Among polled students who 
have taken prescription drugs, 32 percent said they were accessed without a prescription, according to www.pharmacytimes.com.
Half of the students who shared 
or knew of shared prescriptions used pain medication. Nearly 40 percent shared amphetamines, and the same amount used muscle re-laxants.Prescription drug

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Wednesday after he drove about 30 mph 
over the speed limit and told ofﬁ  cers his behavior was inspired by watching “The Fast & the Furious.”
Jorge Alfredo Escarpita was driving 
south on SW 42nd Street in his Nissan 350Z at about 75 mph, according to the report. 
The speed limit for that area is 45 mph.Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Matthew Walters, who was driving a marked vehi-cle, blared his siren and ﬂ  ashed his lights at Escarpita and began chasing him.
Escarpita slowed to about 45 mph but 
continued driving through a four-way stop and another stop sign, according to the report.
He reached the Butler Plaza shopping 
center, according to the report, and he kept driving through the Target parking lot. 
He ﬁ  nally came to a stop nearby.Twenty-one-year-old Escarpita smelled 
strongly of alcohol, according to the re-port, and he propped himself against his car for balance. 
His eyes were red and 
watery, according to the report, and he mumbled 
when he spoke.
He told the ofﬁ  cer he’d 
had three beers and that 
he was driving recklessly because he’d watched “The Fast and the Furious.”
The ofﬁ  cer asked him when he watched 
the movie, and at ﬁ  rst, Escarpita said “To-morrow.” 
But he immediately changed his answer 
to “yesterday,” and then “last night.”
He refused to take both a ﬁ  eld sobriety 
test and a breath test.
Escarpita was arrested at about 3 a.m. 
on charges of driving under the inﬂ  uence and attempting to elude a police ofﬁ  cer. 
He was booked into the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail.
He was later released.Contact Kelcee Grifﬁ  s at kgrifﬁ  s@alligator.

Gainesville residents will 
be glazed with excitement Fri-
day as local shops join bakeries around the country in handing out doughnuts to celebrate the 75-year-old tradition of National Doughnut Day.
Residents can get a taste of 
the festivities at Krispy Kreme, Dunkin’ Donuts and Winn-Dixie. Locally owned Donut Connec-tion, 5205 NW 39 Ave., is also participating.
Donut Connection owner Paul 
Nerger said the shop will offer a free doughnut with every pur-chase, and the menu will include ﬂ  avors not typically found on the lineup, such as dulce de leche and peanut-butter-and-jelly. 
At Krispy Kreme, everyone 
who requests it will get a free doughnut, said Shirley Buchan-an, assistant manager at the 310 NW 13th St. location. 
At Dunkin’ Donuts, patrons 
will receive a free doughnut with the purchase of a drink until clos-ing, according to a news release.  
While at Dunkin’ Donuts, cus-
tomers may also want to try the glazed donut breakfast sandwich — bacon and eggs between a split glazed doughnut — which is join-ing the permanent menu in honor of the occasion, according to the store’s website.
Alexis Locay, a 20-year-old UF 
food science and human nutrition student, said National Doughnut Day is something she plans to participate in.
“It’s probably something me 
and my roommates will do late at night,” Locay said.

Runner’s pain is no pulled muscle; it’s a baby 
DULUTH, Minn. — An aspir-
ing half-marathon runner in Min-nesota attributed her unbearable back pain to a two-hour training session. A day later, she was cra-dling a newborn.
Trish Staine, 33, says she had 
no idea she was pregnant before Monday’s surprise birth. The Duluth mother of three said she hadn’t gained any weight or felt fetal movement in the months before. And besides, her husband had a vasectomy.
“I said ‘no, no, that’s impos-
sible,’” Staine said Wednesday from her Duluth hospital room.
“I definitely thought I was 
done having kids,” she joked. Staine and her husband, John, have a daughter, 7, and a son, 11. She’s also stepmother to John’s three boys, ages 17, 19 and 20.
Staine said she ran for about 
two hours Sunday in prepara-tion for the Garry Bjorklund half-marathon on June 22.
“I had a sore back Sunday eve-
ning. I had taken a hot shower and was dealing with it,” Staine said. “Monday morning, I woke up and had more back pain, and as the day went on it got worse. I been dogging mathematicians since the 1980s.
The Providence, R.I.-based 
American Mathematical Society on Tuesday said $1 million will be awarded for the publication of a solution to the Beal Conjec-ture number theory problem.
Dallas banker D. Andrew 
Beal first offered the Beal Prize in 1997 for $5,000. Over the years, the amount has grown.
American Mathematical So-
ciety spokesman Michael Breen says a solution is more difficult than the one for a related prob-lem, Fermat’s Last Theorem, which didn’t have a published solution for hundreds of years.
Beal is a self-taught math-
ematician and says he wants to inspire young people to pursue math and science.
Widow 84, claims $590M Powerball jackpot
TALLAHASSEE — An 
84-year-old Florida widow who bought her Powerball ticket after another customer let her get ahead in line came forward Wednesday to claim the biggest undivided lottery jackpot in his-tory: $590 million.
Gloria C. MacKenzie, a retiree 
from Maine and a mother of four who lives in a modest, tin-roof house in Zephyrhills, where the lone winning ticket in the May 18 drawing was sold, took her prize in a lump sum of just over $370 million. After federal taxes, she is getting about $278 million, lottery officials said.
She did not speak to a crowd 
of reporters outside lottery head-quarters, leaving quickly in a sil-ver Ford Focus with her son and family friends. She was accom-panied at the lottery offices by two unidentified attorneys.
MacKenzie bought the win-
ning ticket at a Publix supermar-ket in the town of about 13,300, which is 30 miles northeast of Tampa. It is best known for the bottled spring water that bears its name — and now, for one of the biggest lottery winners of all time.
The $590 million was the sec-
ond-largest lottery jackpot in his-tory, behind a $656 million Mega Millions prize in March 2012, but that sum was split, with three winning tickets.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSthought I should go to the ER. I thought I ruptured a disc or pulled a muscle.”
But she soldiered on, watch-
ing her husband play basket-ball at noon and going to her daughter’s short play. When Staine got home, she thought a bath might help her pain.
As she talked to her hus-
band on the phone, Staine said her pain was becoming unbear-able. Her husband called an ambulance.
“I felt like I was dying. I 
didn’t know what was going on,” she said.
During the emergency room 
examination, Staine and her husband were stunned to learn medical staff had detected a fe-tal heartbeat. She was whisked to the delivery room and in what she said seemed like 5 minutes later, her daughter was born at 3:25 p.m. Monday. She weighed 6 pounds, 6 ounc-es, and was 18.9 inches long.
Staine said her husband has 
a good sense of humor.
“He’s still in shock. Every-
body is teasing him,” she said.
Born about five weeks early, 
the Staines expect they will be able to take their baby home in about a week, a girl they have named Mira — short for Miracle.
DNA on beer cans leads to NY suspect’s arrest 
SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Au-
thorities say a burglar’s deci-sion to knock back a couple of beers during a break-in at an upstate New York home led to his arrest.
Onondaga County pros-
ecutors tell The Post-Standard of Syracuse that 29-year-old Moses Wilson was stealing copper piping from a vacant rental home in Syracuse in early February when he found an unopened case of beer in the basement.
Officials say he drank some 
of the beer during the burglary. Prosecutors say police were able to match Wilson’s DNA to DNA found on the cans.
Wilson was arraigned Tues-
day in Onondaga County Court on charges of burglary and pe-tit larceny. He is being held in jail on $10,000 bail. It couldn’t immediately be determined if he had a lawyer.

A UF public relations senior who 
prefers to remain anonymous said she 
has taken amphetamines as a study aid. 
“I’m not a big fan of it, because it 
doesn’t really do much for me,” said the 22-year-old. “It provides a little bit of focus, but not enough to be taking a drug.”
Miller said people — not only stu-
dents — do not realize that there can be negative consequences associated with sharing prescription drugs.
“If you’re taking any sort of medi-
cine that hasn’t been prescribed for you, then you don’t know how your body is going to interact with that,” she said. 
Miller said it is healthier to use time 
management skills, study strategies and campus resources to help with studying and work that need to be done — not drugs.
“You have to remind students 
that you might feel that it’s harmless and helps you get through a couple of things,” she said. “But you really haven’t learned how to deal with stres-sors in a positive and healthy way.”
According to the poll, 18 percent 
of students said their schools have programs dealing with students using drugs as study aids.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013

� AN ALL-VEGGIE DIET HAS A 
BETTER IMPACT ON MEN.
ALANNA MASSEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Everyone knows eating green 
can make you lean, but a study 
shows it lead to a longer life, too.
Researchers at Loma Linda 
University in California recently conducted a study with more than 73,000 participants and determined vegetarians had a 12 percent lower chance of early death than meat-eaters. 
“It’s not surprising to ﬁ  nd posi-
tive effects,” said Wendy Dahl, an assistant professor in UF’s food sci-ence and human nutrition depart-ment. “We know that with many chronic diseases, part of the cause is our eating habits.”
The study found a vegetarian 
diet has a more signiﬁ  cant impact on men than women.
“In general, all recommenda-
tions point to consuming more plant foods and less animal prod-ucts, particularly red meat,” Dahl said. “It’s partly about what the vegetarians aren’t eating, but it’s also about what they are eating.”
Vegetarian diets contain higher 
levels of antioxidants, ﬁ  ber and 
other nutrients, she said.
Michaela Bisienere, a 19-year-old 
UF journalism sophomore, said she hasn’t eaten meat for about three years due to health reasons. When she made the diet change, she no-ticed an increase in energy.
“It forces me to pay a lot of atten-
tion to things that I eat and plan out my meals better,” Bisienere said.
UF marketing junior Julia Wit-
ten, 20, has been a vegetarian since the beginning of the year. She said she eats black beans, spinach, tofu, cheese and eggs to get the nutrients she once got from meat.
Jeff Greenhouse, a 21-year-old 
UF environmental science senior, became a vegetarian at age 11. He was having stomach issues, and his doctor suggested that he stop eat-ing meat. 
“I have been considering trying 
to eat certain things without getting sick, but I haven’t done that yet,” Greenhouse said. “The study is giv-ing me a reason not to try eating meat again.”Vegetarians have lower chance of early death, study says

Tuesday’s Student Senate 
meeting got heated during 
a discussion of online vot-ing but ended smoothly with the ﬁ  rst presentation of the amended activity and service fee budget.
A committee on elec-
tion code reform discussed the proposal last week at its meeting and is due to vote on it today. 
Several people, including 
former Sen. Carly Wilson, spoke in favor of online vot-ing.
District D Sen. Helie Dha-
ria said it can be hard for off-campus residents to ﬁ  nd time and transportation to come to UF to vote. 
She added that the bill 
doesn’t guarantee implemen-tation or voting from phones — it only makes it theoreti-cally possible.
“There are absolutely is-
sues with the current voting system, but it’s our job as senators to work with the Su-pervisor of Elections and IT to ﬁ  x these issues,” she said during public debate. “De-nying the option of online voting means you don’t care what your constituents have to say,” she said. 
Later in the meeting, 
Budget and Appropriations Chairman Joseph Michaels brieﬂ  y presented amend-ments to the Fiscal Year 2013-2014 Activity and Service Fee budget, which pending the Senate’s approval, will take effect July 1.
The amended budget to-
tals $18,992,300. 
The changes include a 
high ropes course at Lake Wauburg and a 7.8 percent increase in the budgets for student organizations.
Michaels said the ﬁ  rst 
reading of the budget will come next week, at which time senators will likely have an in-depth discussion.

UF researchers have created tiny, unmanned 
airplanes and submarines that can travel inside 
hurricanes and collect data in real time. 
The miniature vehicles 
will gather information on storms’ strength and paths, said Kamran Mohseni, a UF professor who worked on the project. 
“The problem is getting 
the accuracy, intensity and trajectory of a hurricane pre-dicted well,” Mohseni said. 
“We noticed that the mentality of researchers is to fight the hurricane. We went in a different direction and thought we could use the hur-ricane.”
The 6-inch airplanes and submarines are 
equipped with several sensors, a radio trans-mitter, a GPS, a processor and a motor. Each airplane weighs about 80 grams, which is a little heavier than an egg. 
The vehicles, which are controlled by computers, are launched into the air or water and act as debris that the hurricane can toss around.
To develop the submarines, Mohseni and 
his team of 20 graduate students studied the movement of jellyfish and squid. 
The team has a squid care-and-testing facil-
ity to research movement patterns and sensory systems. 
The airplanes and submarines have not 
been tested in an actual hurricane yet. They have, however, gone through hurricane simu-lations using real data. 
Doug Lipinski, a postdoctoral researcher 
in UF’s Department of Mechanical and Aero-space Engineering, played a large role in the simulation part of the project. 
“We used data from Hurricane Rita, which 
hit in 2005,” Lipinski said. “That data was fair-ly incomplete, though, so we performed simu-lations to fill in what was missing. You end up with a high-resolution data set, and from there you can observe how the vehicles would work in a hurricane.”
Mohseni said the team hopes to continue 
testing the vehicles and eventually implement UF team creates tiny, storm-

A Floridian who worked to preserve 
the state’s natural resources — includ-
ing the Everglades — has been named the Bob Graham Center’s first Citizen of the Year. Nathaniel Reed won for his ef-forts as an environmental activist.
“We wanted to establish the Citizen 
of the Year award in order to recognize Floridian residents who have made a substantial contribution to the state,” said Shelby Taylor, the center’s digital communications director.
A committee of leading citizens 
drawn from various backgrounds in Florida chose the winner, along with two honorees — Martha Barnett and Ellen Friedin. The award ceremony will be Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at Shula’s Hotel and Golf Club in Miami Lakes.
Reed is vice chairman of both the 
Everglades Foundation and the Florida Conservation Coalition, according to a news release.
“Reed’s selfless service to our state 
was really impressive,” Taylor said. “He 
has made a huge difference in the health of the state that we all share and love.”
Reed was an important figure dur-
ing the signing of the Florida Jetport Pact, which stopped construction by the Everglades, and the abandonment of the Cross-Florida Barge Canal project. A few years later, he accepted the invita-tion of President Richard Nixon to be-come Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife and National Parks, according to the release.
Reed was sick and unavailable for 
comment.
“People are generally preoccupied 
with growth, regardless of space and resources,” said Nicholas Brown, a 23-year-old UF environmental engi-neering alumnus. “Mr. Reed has taken into account the environmental crisis, and that not only includes physical and biological factors, but the social conse-quences of the environmental segrega-tion.”Center to award activist

Every Wednesday at the Union Street Farmers Market 
in Gainesville you can ﬁ  nd a wide array of locally produced food including organic produce and vegan-
friendly food carts. The Union Street Farmers Market, as well as the countless other farmers markets held nationwide, are believed to produce healthier, better tasting food and pro-mote environmentally friendliness while bolstering local economies. Although these notions are commonly accepted as truth by the general public, these claims are gross over-statements of the menial impact of the local food movement.
The popularity of the local food movement and farmers 
markets has skyrocketed in recent years. According to the 
Consumer Reports health periodical about the beneﬁ  ts of eating locally, “The number of farmers markets in the U.S. in-creased 54 percent between 2008 and 2011.” Yet despite their popularity, their environmental impacts and health beneﬁ  ts are at best hype and at worst simply not true.
The claim that farmers markets are an environmentally 
friendly alternative to mass-produced, corporate farming is incredibly shortsighted. Local food enthusiasts, also known as “locavores,” claim that by reducing the amount of fuel used to transport their food, they have managed to curb the environmental impact of food production. As obvious and intuitive as this may sound, it is a very vague and unstable claim to make because there is no universal deﬁ  nition of local among locavores. Some locavores consider food produced up to 400 miles away local. 
The type of transportation used to deliver local foods to 
market is also a varying factoring in the eco-friendliness of eating locally. For example, freight trains are ten times more efﬁ  cient at moving freight than trucks. If you were to pur-chase potatoes grown 100 miles away that were shipped via truck, you’d be making the same environmental impact had you chosen potatoes shipped from 1,000 miles away via train. This is a huge variable that does not seem to be taken into account by many local-food enthusiasts.
Buying organic in conjunction with local seems to be the 
gold standard for most locavores, under the assumption that organic foods are healthier than their nonorganic counter-parts. But after conducting two intensive studies regarding the nutritional differences between these two food groups, the Indian Journal of Medical Research stated the following: “Despite an exten-sive search process which identi-ﬁ  ed more than 92,000 papers, we only found 11 relevant publica-
tions that were of extremely variable quality. Our conclusion from this second review is that there is currently no evidence of any nutrition-related health beneﬁ  ts from consuming or-ganic foods.” 
Not only have organic foods not been proven to be health-
ier than nonorganics, they are generally more expensive than nonorganics because they are more labor intensive to pro-duce and are produced at a smaller yield. Thus, increasing the cost of food is a negative effect on consumers and the local economy because the extra money now spent on food could have been saved or spent elsewhere.
The assumption that local farmers markets are saving jobs 
is yet another fallacy propagated by the local food move-ment. Asserting that ﬁ  nding more efﬁ  cient ways of produc-ing food will destroy local jobs is mere conjecture. According to Swedish author and historian Johan Norberg in his 2003 book “In Defense of Global Capitalism,” in pre-19th century Sweden, 80 percent of its population worked in agriculture, but today that ﬁ  gure is around 3 percent. That does not mean that the remaining 77 percent is now employed, but with time that manpower has found its way into other industries, providing us with better housing, clothing, medicines and entertainment.
I am in no way opposed to shopping at the Union Street 
Farmers Market, nor am I opposed to people freely choosing to purchase locally and organically, but the level of hype sur-rounding the locally grown food movement is just a passing phase.

Probably not, but does that justify the use of force? The puppy was also hurt. Mi-

The American Civil Liberties Union just released a report 
entitled “The War on Marijuana in Black and White.” The report found that in 2010, there was one marijuana arrest every 37 seconds. Altogether, the states spent more than $3.6 billion on enforcing marijuana possession laws the same year. The report, focusing on racial disparities, also found that on average a black person is “3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, even though Blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates.” For continuing to push against the madness that is the drug war, and speciﬁ  cally the war on marijuana, we give the ACLU a LAUREL in the shape of a liberty torch.
Unfortunately, not everyone holds the torch of liberty so 
high. When that happens, we have to make darts in the same shape. In this case, Judge Edith H. Jones of the Fifth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals has been accused of violating the code of conduct for judges. According to the formal com-plaint, Jones said “racial groups like African-Americans and Hispanics are predisposed to crime.” The comments are al-leged to have been made in a speech at the University of Pennsylvania Law School in February. She is also accused of saying “a killer is only likely to make peace with God and the victim’s family in that moment when the killer faces imminent execution, recognizing that he or she is about to face God’s judgment.” For saying all kinds of strange things, Justice Jones gets a not-in-my-America DART.
The up-and-coming asteroid mining company Planetary 
Resources launched a Kickstarter campaign called “ARKYD: A Space Telescope for Everyone.” The telescope is a symbol of the public’s interest in funding the exploration of outer space. In addition to the telescope, Planetary Resources will be creating a public interface as well as funding an educa-tional curriculum for students. The project is backed by Bill Nye the Science Guy, a couple of “Star Trek” actors and other big names. We give a our ﬁ  nal LAUREL of the week to 
Planetary Resources for answering the call of a public that is hungry to learn more about the cosmos.

When Becca Huy sat down with her sig-
nificant other to discuss their future, she made 
sure she mentioned that she expected to hear the pitter-patter of little feet.
Chicken feet, that is.Years later, the 28-year-old founder of the 
local group Gainesville Friends of Hens is still advocating for chickens.
In response to interest from residents like 
Huy, Gainesville Planning Manager Ralph Hilliard submitted a proposal to the City Plan-ning Committee that would up the current al-lowance of two chickens per household in the city limits to four or six. 
The petition will go to the city plan board 
on July 25, Hilliard wrote in an email. If the city plan board approves, the plan will go to the City Commission for vote August 15. 
Gainesville City Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins specified that single-family neigh-borhoods — where two chickens are currently allowed — are areas where only one hous-ing unit is allowed per lot. These areas do not include duplexes or apartment complexes, where chickens are banned. 
Although Huy said the proposal is moving 
in the right direction, she said putting a spe-cific number to the amount of chickens allowed may not be the answer.
“I think it would be 
great if we could have more chickens, but I don’t think 
the magic number is four to six,” she said. “If you’re first starting out, four is a good amount, but if you’re more 
experienced, you’re going to want more.”
At this time, the proposal does not permit 
roosters and specifies that chickens must be contained in a backyard setting. 
Hawkins said that while the main con-cern with increasing the number of chickens is noise, owning more chickens is likely to be less noisy than owning just two.
“Because of the way (chickens) interact, two 
are likely to be more noisy than six,” Hawkins said. “Once you get more, they all sort of hang out with each other and tend to be less noisy and cause less trouble.”
Tyler Black, an Alachua County chicken 
keeper who owns a flock of about 30, said chick-ens aren’t necessarily noisier than other pets.
“Hens don’t crow like roosters, but they do 
sing a song when they lay eggs,” said Black, 29. “But who is to say a pet chicken is less an-noying than a dog or a cat?”

Gainesville residents can 
look forward to a new place 
to chow down in Butler Pla-za.
BurgerFi, a restaurant 
franchise that first opened in 2011 in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla., is the first tenant to announce it will occupy part of a new five-suite building at 3518 SW Archer Road.
The restaurant has “an 
overall focus on a healthi-er menu selection,” owner Henry Talerico wrote in an email.  
The franchise will sell 
items including grass-fed beef hamburgers, Austra-lian Wagyu beef hot dogs, handcut french fries, and selections of craft beers and wines.
Kristin Mamula, a market-
ing associate for Butler En-terprises, said the company’s emphasis on healthier menu options makes it a good fit for Butler Plaza.
“We’ve noticed Gainesville 
becoming more health con-scious, especially with their food choices,” Mamula said.
The BurgerFi restaurant 
will be built over the summer and is expected to open in the fall, Mamula said. It will em-ploy about 50 people.
The building will take over 
a space formerly occupied by Florida Citizens Bank and a Checkers. Both buildings were recently demolished. Construction bids for the building will be announced in the next week. Afterward, construction will begin.
Talerico, a UF graduate, 
said BurgerFi’s construction will follow environmentally sustainable practices, includ-ing using recycled materials and decor made from Coca-Cola bottles.
He said BurgerFi chose 
to anchor a franchise in Gainesville because it is a “growing and dynamic com-munity” and would give them the ability to cross-mar-ket in Florida. Most BurgerFi locations in Florida are locat-ed in coastal communities. 
Dante Campanaro, a 
24-year-old Santa Fe College humanities sophomore, said the business may “be hit-or-miss” because it will have to compete with other restau-rants in Butler Plaza. He said healthier options may draw in students in ways tradition-al burger joints have not.
“There are lots of kids 
who are health conscious and trying to be hip,” said Cam-panaro.Coastal burger joint

Local conservative talk show WBXY 99.5 is now an 
electronic dance party.
President and CEO of JVC broadcasting company 
John Caracciolo said EDM — electronic dance music — 
is taking over the nation but has been underserved to the Gainesville market.
With EDM attracting young adults 18 to 26, Carac-
ciolo said the nearly 50,000 students at UF would make the switch a profitable one.
However, Caracciolo said not everyone is excited 
about the new music. Change can be hard to adjust to, he said, but the talk radio was underperforming and not generating enough income.“Talk radio is a great format, but 
it is not making money,” he said. “I have to put format and a program on that is exciting and endearing to the local community and makes money. There has got to be a balance.”
Because the company consists of 
five radio stations, Caracciolo said he still wanted to incorporate talk radio on other stations.
Casey Wooster, a 21-year-old creative photography 
and anthropology senior, said although she likes to lis-ten to talk radio she knows not everyone does.
“I think there is a need for diversity,” she said. “It re-
flects the demand in the area.”

One single distraction inside a car can be 
more hazardous to drivers than obstacles on 
the road: backseat drivers. 
A recent survey conducted by www.insur-
ance.com revealed one of the worst distrac-tions to drivers is their passengers.Of the 500 drivers polled, the largest num-
ber of backseat drivers were spouses, followed by mothers and friends. Teens were ranked the lowest.
According to the survey, the biggest annoy-
ances were comments on speed followed by giving directions, excessive talking and push-ing an imaginary brake on the floorboard.  
It also showed that, aside from offering 
commentary, passengers tend to distract driv-ers by fiddling with the radio, talking on the phone, texting, singing and even eating.
Danielle Hilton, a 19-year-old UF public re-
lations junior, said she expects backseat driv-ing on an upcoming family road trip — “espe-cially my dad telling my mom how to drive,” she said. At times, she said, she too takes on the role of backseat driver.
“I tell my boyfriend to slow down all the 
time because it scares me,” Hilton said. “But drivers need to be conscious of what’s going on.”
Brian Miller, who served as a Broward 
County deputy sheriff for seven years, sug-gested travelers manage backseat driving by talking about it before passengers get in. Distracting backseat drivers can be dangerous, survey says
“I tell my boyfriend to slow down 
all the time because it scares me,

what’s going on.”

Brace for impact. 
Tropical Storm Andrea became 
the first named storm of the 2013 hurricane season Wednesday after-noon after it strengthened off the coast of Mexico.
As of press time, a tropical storm 
warning reached from near Apala-chicola to near Port Charlotte. That area could experience winds of 39 to 73 miles per hour today, accord-ing to the National Hurricane Cen-ter.
The official forecast has the 
center of the storm passing near Gainesville by the end of the day today. UF has not officially an-nounced any change to classes.
“The emergency management 
team has been monitoring the storm all week, and at this time we’re not anticipating significant impact oth-er than rain,” UF spokeswoman Ja-nine Sikes said.
UF chemical engineering sopho-
more Katelyn Ezelle, 18, isn’t too worried about it, either. She said she moved to Pensacola less than two months before Hurricane Ivan hit Florida, a Category 3 at the time.
“When it hit, we lived pretty 
close to the water … we had about 4 feet of water damage,” she said. “So if [Andrea] comes, I’m sure I’ll get a call from my dad.”

Tropical Storm Andrea predicted to pass near Gainesville today
Equations that predict atmospheric be-
havior are plotted on this map and show the best guess for intensity and position of a tropical storm. These “spaghetti 
models” are calculated by several different agencies worldwide up to several times a day. The current NOAA prediction suggests Andrea’s center passing near Gainesville before the end of the day. We will be tweet-ing updates from @TheAlligator. This was the position of Tropical Storm 
Andrea on Wednesday morning. The storm was stronger and its structure better organized — rotating around a 
clearer center — by Wednesday afternoon to officially make it the first named storm of the 2013 hurricane season. Air Force reconnais-sance aircraft, or “Hurricane Hunters,” have 
been flying and plan to fly through it today.

It was a hot and humid sum-
mer night in Gainesville, but an ir-
regular breeze and large cumulus clouds offered those hitting the pavement an appreciated relief from the typical Florida muggi-ness we’ve grown accustomed to bearing.
Juxtaposed with the weather 
was the lively vibe adrift through-out downtown Gainesville last Friday night. The weekend buzz that usually encompasses the neighborhood was in effect but was further escalated by the pres-ence of Artwalk Gainesville. A free self-guided tour from 7 to 10 p.m. on the last Friday of every month, Artwalk Gainesville has become a local event that brings the public together in celebration of local visual art talent.
Various artists from Gainesville 
and outlying regional towns come together to share their work in downtown galleries, nightlife venues and booths set up on Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The result is an unexpected mix of tal-ent — a reminder of the truly in-finite avenues one can take when seeking outlets for artistic expres-sion. Attendees can pick up a free 
map that outlines the various festivities taking place through-out town — available both at the Artwalk booth and the event’s website: www.artwalkgainesville.com.
Morgan Motes, a 15-year-old 
sophomore from Palatka High School, exhibited his artwork for the first time at Artwalk on Fri-day. Although he is years young-er than many of the other artists at this event, Motes proved age does not matter in talent capability. His paintings demonstrate crossover influences of Surrealism and draft illustration and offer insight into the mind of a self-reflective teen.
“My art is all about high school 
angst,” Motes said as he stood be-side a table that exhibited a por-tion of his portfolio. “Each piece has its own story that has to do with whatever’s going on with my life. I do about a piece a week and try to incorporate my life in each work — just make it flow.”
Though Artwalk attracts art-
ists and supporters from all age groups -- proving that Gainesville social events extend beyond the traditional college town demo-graphic — there was a noticeably large number of adults in their early twenties present at the event. Lindsey Jones and Trisha Thomp-son have attended a number of Artwalks in the past and noticed a difference between the summer events and those that take place during UF’s academic year.
“The youngins are out and 
about, and the area is small enough where you’ll usually run into people you know. Galleries like the Doris, Display and places on Main Street are good places to go,” said Jones, a 21-year-old UF film studies major. She and Thompson looked at their maps  while on the corner of Main Street and First Avenue South, planning their route for the evening. 
“Summer artwalks create a 
different kind of vibe. It’s a little more quiet and sleepy but still re-ally nice to get out.”

Some people love them; some people hate 
them. And I’m talking about road trips. Per-
sonally, I’ve never really been a big fan. My motto has pretty much always been “why drive when you can fly?” But the more I thought about it, the more I realized there is a beauty to road trips that can’t be found when you fly. With a road trip, it’s more about the journey and less about the destination, and there’s something beautiful about that. I con-sider myself a road trip convert. So I’m go-ing to share five road trips I think everyone should take before turning 25. Hopefully, this will either fuel a desire you already have to take road trips or help you become a new fan of road trips.
1.     A road trip with your honey. Most people think of a romantic getaway as a nice cruise, or a stay on a tropical island or a Euro-pean adventure, but when you ask someone if a road trip is romantic, most say no. But they are so wrong.  A road trip gives you time to really talk, and a recent “Cosmopolitan” ar-ticle said couples tend to have their most inti-mate and serious conversations while driving together. And it totally makes sense. I mean pretty much all there is to do is talk. Plus, it gives you time to explore new things together in a way you probably don’t do very often.
2.     The classic bad food, drink-almost-
the-whole-time college road trip. I’m sure a lot of you have already taken this road trip, probably to an away football game, but if you haven’t yet, you need to. You’ll make deci-sions you’ll regret and feel absolutely terrible when you get home, but those drunk mo-ments will live on as glorious college memo-ries.3.     The girl’s/guy’s 
weekend getaway road trip. Friends of the opposite sex are great, but there’s something really nice about spending the whole week-end with your girls or guys. Maybe it’s the fact that you 
don’t have to worry about your appearance as much with your same sex friends, or may-be it’s that you can unapologetically bash the opposite sex with no shred of guilt. Well, it’s definitely the latter for me. Regardless, you’ll come home feeling so relaxed.
4.     Siblings road trip. Ahh, that brings 
back memories, doesn’t it? Just typing that made me think of all the stupid arguments my sister and I used to have while on road trips when we were children. And while we haven’t taken a road trip with just the two of us, I really think that it would strengthen our relationship now. No more bickering over what Disney music we’ll listen to. At least for me, so much of the time I spend with my sis-ter involves other family members, so I think just having a siblings trip allows you to really bond with your sibling(s).
5.     Road trip with no plans. OK, some 
of you may think I’m crazy. For some, the thought of not having a planned trip is enough to make them literally walk off a cliff before ever doing something like that. (Trust me; I know. Every single person in my family besides myself is like that.) But there are many great things about a trip like that if you look at it from the right perspective. For example, view having no plans as an opportunity to do things you would never be able to do when you have to adhere to your schedule. And living on the edge when you normally freak out being a minute late for class. It could do wonders for you.

Frame-ﬁ  lled white walls bring 
children still holding their mother’s 
hands, as well as university-age young adults. This is where the stares of hundreds of eyes are not daunting but welcomed. This room is where cultural appreciation meets storytelling. 
Even still, there is mystery be-
hind each face on the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art’s walls. The Much Ado About Portraits exhibi-tion — which is the ﬁ  rst Harn ex-hibit to use pieces from other Harn main collecting areas — examines the creation, meaning and impor-tance of portraits, according to a Harn Museum of Art news release.
“It will be fascinating for visi-
tors to explore those meanings and learn about the similarities and dif-ferences of portraits from different times and places,” said Jason Steu-ber, confrin curator of Asian art and lead curator of the exhibit, in the news release.
More than 100 portraits ex-
pressed through multiple mediums chronicle works from before the Common Era to the present day, according to the release.
On each wall, a face stares at the 
onlooker, telling a story of sorts.
One section of the exhibit holds photographs of Billie Holiday, Si-natra, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole singing jazz era tunes, frozen in time in black and white.
“The musician’s face is suffused 
with effort and emotion and beau-ty: the music is there,” William Got-tlieb, the photographer, wrote on a small white card that was placed next to the portraits.
Next to the majority of the por-
traits in the exhibit, cards told anec-dotes and facts about the pieces and their artists.
Looking closely, you can almost 
hear what he’s talking about in Fitzgerald’s closed eyes and Sina-tra’s sly smile.
“(The exhibit) illustrates the 
variety the portrait can take,” said Kelsey Velez, a Harn Museum in-tern and recent UF graduate. “It al-lows us to take a closer look at im-ages we take for granted.”
On an LCD television screen at 
the edge of the exhibit, the faces of high school students, who were encouraged by the Harn to send in their portraits, ﬂ  ashed on the screen to show the simple beauty of the face of a regular person.
For $3, any visitor can sit in the 
small photo booth adjacent to the TV and have their photos ﬂ  ash on screen as well.
“It’s fun for people to get their 
photo taken,” said Neila Darnby, who climbed out of the photo booth with her niece and nephew while their mother Jenn Garrett stood outside, smiling as her daughter’s face came on screen.
“I want the kids to feel comfort-
able around art,” Garrett said about bringing her two children to the exhibit.
Garrett is also an artist whose 
“Into the Smoke” sculpture can be found outside Fire Station 1 on South Main Street.
On Sept. 8, the faces, still and 
emotional, in the portraits at the exhibit will be sent back to their original spots in the museum or to the owner who loaned them to be looked upon at the exhibit.
In the meantime, however, hun-
dreds of faces are waiting for visi-tors to come and learn their stories.
“(Portraits) are the best way of 
understanding the human exis-tence,” Velez said.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
How many is considered too many 
when talking about the number of 
sexual partners for a female?
Dear Friend,
In the words of Cady from Mean Girls, 
“the limit does not exist!” As long as 
you aren’t harming yourself or others, do what you want with your body. Use protection and always have a couple of rubbers just in case the guy you’re with doesn’t. The amount of sexual partners you have does not define you — in fact, it does not matter. You should be looking for quality, not quantity. Feel comfortable and happy with your partners. Sure, we’ll make an exception for a few bozos here and there, but let’s just blame alcohol or poor judgment. Don’t restrict yourself from having a good time with someone you want to be with because of a silly number. That number is no one’s busi-
ness but your own.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What are your credentials 
for giving advice?
Dear Friend,
Freedom of speech and 
freedom of the press.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I like to think I’m the jokester in my fam -
ily, but I get a lot of awkward looks instead 
of laughs. I just think they have a bad sense of humor, but how am I supposed to know when I’ve crossed the line?Dear Mediocre Advice,
Last week I started talking to this guy on OkCupid.com. We 
really hit it off and have been constantly texting each other ever since. He’s made several mentions of taking me out on a date but has yet to actually ask me on one or attempt to make plans. Should I just bite the bullet and ask him out or should 
I just forget about him?
Dear Friend,
There is such a thing as The Realm of No. It’s a place that you enter once you have said some-
thing ridiculously inappropriate. Your family probably suffers from this daily. In The Realm of No, 
people cannot un-see or un-know the foul thing you just did or said. Amanda Bynes is the current queen of The Realm of No with her intellectual tweets and hip new look. Unfortunately, the only way to know when you’re in this realm is after you have said or done something obscene. To avoid this realm, just say and do very little. Do so little that people will think you have a mental illness. It would probably be better than the child pornography joke you think is appropriate to tell your mom.Dear Friend,
It looks like you’re going to have to take the reins and 
ask him out yourself. You felt a connection for a reason, and it would be a shame to let it go to waste just because you didn’t want to make the first move. When you meet this guy for first time I suggest you take these items with you for safety: a switchblade, pepper spray, a life alert necklace and a large over-protective dog. Avoid alleys, and empty places, and drink from a sippy cup in case he 
tries anything funny.

For the past several months 
now, my Facebook newsfeed has 
been clogged with the laments of “The Walking Dead” and “Game of Thrones” fans who complain mostly about the same thing: the injustice of the fact the season finales of their beloved shows end with cliff hang-ers. I could never understand why these viewers get so upset, as both of these series are based on comic books and novels, which means the conclusions to these shows were ac-tually released years ago. Besides, should they decide not to — God forbid — read anything, they only have to wait a few months for new episodes. This I don’t understand because as an “Arrested Devel-opment” fan, I had to wait seven years.
And such is the life of an “Ar-rested Development” fan — one ruled by bitter, jilted, television-hat-ing resentment. Resentment about the fact that what was arguably the most original writing on television was canceled while the mind-numb-ing tedium of shows like “Two and a Half Men” went right along their merry way — even after their main character “broke” character just long enough to show America the collection of hookers he kept read-ily available in the horror shop he called a mansion. Which brings us back to season four of “Arrested De-velopment.”
Season four was released just last 
week, and it is, for lack of a better word, different. Fans, if you haven’t seen it yet, you should. But let’s be honest, you’ve seen it, because if you’re an “Arrested Development” fan, you’ve likely spent the last seven years watching the previous three seasons over and over again to the extent you could recite the entire show linearly. The fan base of “Arrested Development” is not a fan base so much as it is a cult. And you’ve likely already formed an opinion about it and have likely al-ready tweeted or Facebooked about 
it, and you’re probably only reading this to see which refer-ence to the show I’ll decide to pay homage to. But then, I’m no more a writer than I am 
a gentleman beekeeper — you’re welcome, fans — and so I will direct this to any non-fan who has lived under a rock long enough not to have seen the latest episodes. And to that I will say this: Stop whatever it is that you are doing and go watch all four seasons of this show.
In short, it is time to start living.Dan Zak from the Washington 
Times put it best when he said the new season is “a chore to watch.” And he was right. Because once you start watching, it is all but impos-sible to stop. What makes season four so different from one through three is the breadth and scope of its interconnected plot. While the pre-vious show’s episodes were 22 min-utes long and neatly capped at the end with a culmination of the day’s comedic insanity, season four’s epi-sodes span years and tie together a multitude of events, jumping back and forth through time as it follows single characters to build comedy in a symphonic way. It’s one that ulti-mately brings the season to its satiri-cal, burlesque-induced crescendo. Picture Beethoven’s Fifth sympho-ny composed with laughter.
The end of season four is one of 
the most rewarding TV experiences I have ever had. There are no spoil-ers here, but I will say that I have already began to rewatch in an at-tempt to piece together the comedy crumbs sprinkled throughout by the show’s creator, Mitchell Hurwitz. 
You may hesitate to watch 
when you hear people complain that the show’s not the same — that they butchered the “Arrested Development”-ness right out of it. They are not completely  wrong: It is different — but for the better. What Hurwitz did was a nod to his fans, and he wanted to give them some-thing special, artful and twisted be-yond all reason. And that he did. 
He did not resuscitate “Arrested 
Development” — he created some-thing new, just for us. A friend of mine who watched the new season said, ever so eloquently, “Anyone who hates on this is an idiot. This is the most brilliant writing I’ve ever seen.” Granted, this is the same friend who texted me after watch-ing “Shame” and said he might be a sex addict. But there’s one thing I can’t disagree with: The show’s writing is brilliant — addictively, compulsively so. 
Happy watching.

hair pieces is picking out the colors and seeing the kids’ faces when they look in the mirror,” said Beverly Watson, 64, a retired elementary school music teacher. 
Along with her husband, Bill, a 65-
year-old retired construction worker, Beverly began making handmade crafts 24 years ago. Beverly started her busi-ness by making dolls during Christmas time, including Santas and snowmen. It was not until her granddaughter Lia Watson, 5, was born that she be-gan making hair accessories — the same ones she was selling this week-end. Watson’s hair accessories include a wide variety of different headbands and hair ties featuring bright colors and bows.
Not everything featured in the small 
weekend show is handmade, though. 
Linda Quinn, 65, owner of Silver 
Sun, began selling jewelry from the manufacturer Capri Williams starting 30 years ago. Linda stumbled upon The Oaks Mall last Christmas by accident. She was lost and ended up at the mall, where she rented a booth and sold her jewelry. All of Quinn’s jewelry is nick-el-free. We never sell at retail prices, only wholesale, Quinn said.
The Oaks Mall Art, Craft & Lifestyle 
Show had something for almost every-one. In addition to hair accessories and jewelry, Tupperware, jellyﬁ  sh lamps, paint-it-yourself pottery and scarves were available for purchase this week-end. 
Don’t miss out on the next one. THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Garrett Bunton, dressed in a dark robe only 
long enough to cover his green plaid boxers, 
held a long cane while stripping to the song “Magic Stick” by 50 Cent.
Bunton played Dumblewhore — a spinoff 
of the “Harry Potter” character Albus Dumb-ledore — in the Hurly Burly Male Burlesque show “Hairy Potter and the Sorcerer’s Bone.”
Hurly Burly performed Sunday at the High 
Dive downtown at 10 p.m. The show, which lasted about two hours, featured half-naked humping, thrusting and romp shaking.
As clothes hit the ﬂ  oor, 
squeals and dollar bills came from the crowd of women but also pockets of men.
Josh Rey, a 34-year-old 
Gainesville resident, called the performance “inventive, entertaining, captivating.”
Although some of the 
performers didn’t have “Magic Mike” abs, the show was one-of-a-kind and enjoyable because it told a story.
The storyline centered on “Harry Potter” 
— but with a twist. Hairy endured fraternity-style hazing, which involved stripping, to join Gryfﬁ  ndor House. Rod Weasley and other char-acters from the book also did strip teases. 
Many of the performers incorporated ﬁ  re 
or a large, fake penis to thrill the audience. The show also had an auction so the audience mem-bers could take photos and get up close and per-sonal with their favorite performers.
This group of tattooed and bearded men 
started performing together about a year ago.
Tim Fine, who played Lord Voldemort and 
Severus Snape, said the group of friends heard of female burlesque shows in their hometown of Lake Worth and thought they could do better. Fine said one night they threw together a show and performed in front of about 250 women.
“We all looked at each other after the show 
and were like ‘Maybe this is more than a one-trick pony,’” Fine said. “We’ve done it ever since.”
Bunton said he hopes performing can one 
day replace his day job.High Dive hosts

The Florida-favorite grocery 
store Publix has three locations 
within walking distance of each other on Archer Road. Trader Joe’s, also located in close proximity, opened this year with specialty and lesser-known products. There are, of course, other stores to get groceries and other necessities: Target, Wal-mart, Walgreens, if you wish. But buying local, which encompasses buying foods locally grown by pro-fessional or home-based growers on farms, is a completely new experi-ence. 
Ward’s Supermarket has been a 
buy-in-bulk, one-stop shop for a vast array of locally grown grocery shop-ping needs. But what about a new kind of local buying that doesn’t involve an actual grocery store or, better yet, doesn’t involve a store at all? Behold the green market, which seems to have made a trendy come-back in food shopping, especially as the summer months roll in and leave college students with more free time and Gainesville residents with a bevy of seasonal food options.
Some of the best green markets 
I’ve checked out to get your locally grown food shopping on are:
Monday: Tioga Monday Market 
at Tioga Town Center is a bit of a stretch, as its location in Jonesville makes it less appealing to Gainesville residents looking for convenience. And why would you want to go out of your way to grocery shop? Good question, but like I said before, green markets provide an alternative, even more personalized shopping experi-ence. Although a bit smaller, this open-air, fair-weather Monday mar-ket on West Newberry Road from 4 to 7 p.m. has those great local food vendors but also provides an exit route to one of the many shops in Tioga Town Center — including the new World of Beer.
Wednesday: Union Street Farm-
ers Market at Bo Diddley Plaza downtown is one of my favorites. Also from 4 to 7 p.m., the last of the cooler weather crops, such as lettuce and strawberries, were being sold for reasonable prices to make up for the $5 pint of blueberries each vendor was selling, I’m sure. But hey, that’s the price you pay to support your local community. I had a sample of tempeh that I thought was produced by magic hands. While attracting a seemingly younger crowd, the plaza allowed for a large number of the earthy-crunchy vendors to be closer together and sold a lot of produce as well as already-prepared foods such as quinoa salad. Kudos to them for landing a spot at the most visited green market I ventured to as well.
One in particular, Hoggtowne 
Lemonade Co. has been at the mar-ket since April of last year and is out every Wednesday as well as Satur-day at Haile Plantation. After selling me their raspberry hibiscus lemon-ade, which I am forever hooked on, co-owner Adam Streifel said he buys the fruit he started juicing at home every morning from Ward’s and lo-cal farms. It’s all “locally sourced,” he said, “especially the blueberries and strawberries right now from Williston.”
Saturday: The Haile Farmers 
Market at the Village Center from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Saturdays was nothing short of beautiful. May-be it had to do with the perfect sun-ny weather, but this green market’s location winding through a road nestled in between quaint shops and smaller restaurants was iconic. Vendors had huge smiles plastered on their faces as mostly families me-andered through the market. When compared to Union Street Market, Haile had fewer vendors and sam-pling opportunities. However, Haile provided a proportional amount of produce vendors to cheese and pas-try vendors and even specialty ven-dors, such as ﬂ  owers.
Amanda Bowers’ baked goods 
stand BakerBaker caught my atten-tion with its delicately wrapped pas-tries such as the pecan bars. Bowers had a stand since June 2012 at the market, and it is the only location she sells from outside of her home, which she rents out of and does “small catering things.” She said it was popular to become a “cottage food baker, which was a law passed in November that allowed people to bake out of their homes without a certiﬁ  ed kitchen.” 
Bowers sells out of everything by 
about 10 a.m. each Saturday morn-ing and also buys her ingredients from markets, especially the sea-sonal zucchinis and blueberries cur-rently.
Saturday: The Alachua County 
Farmers Market at the corner of U.S. Highway 441 and County Road 121 is an outdoors green market for your produce ﬁ  x. A smaller market covered by a single large tent, the greens and local veggie produce is in abundance. Small tables with a handful of browsing buyers suggest this is a lesser-known market. I al-most passed it on the road, honestly. But it continues to be a friendly at-mosphere, and like the Union Street Market, it offers the option of using a credit card to purchase special coins to use at the market when you forget to bring cash.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013

Summer has always been a popular season 
for the deliverance of fresh songs and albums, 
but one band’s new release is standing out in the rock genre.
With more than two decades of musical expe-
rience under its members’ belts, Alice in Chains, the rock band known for its unique harmonies and emergence into the grunge scene in the ‘90s, recently put out its 5th studio album. “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here” was released on iTunes on May 28. It features 12 songs and has been in the works since late 2011.
Overall, the album has ﬁ  delity to the band’s 
roots. The songs are still akin to the lengths of those on previous albums and deﬁ  nitely link to the band, but they feature some new elements. All of the songs were written by band members.
As lead singer Jerry Cantrell said in an inter-
view with Rolling Stone, “We made a unique record that’s completely different from anything we ever did. It encapsulates a period of time, like all records do. You see growth and that the band is moving ahead in new territory that we haven’t been to before, but we haven’t lost our identity.”
The quartet’s collection of new music features 
the single “Hollow,” which was premiered via YouTube in December, showing a slide-show of pictures that fans sent in on Instagram. The song has “Man in the Box” potential, as do some of the others on the album. I would deﬁ  nitely rec-
ommend “Lab Monkey” despite the fact that it’s a less popular song, as it really delivers. “Stone,” the second single from the album, has also be-come a favorite of mine.
Alice in Chains will begin the U.S. leg of its 
tour in August. See the band’s website for dates and more album details. www.AliceinChains.com.Alice In Chains enters new turf

Whales, Jon Foreman
FACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/theoldcountryfl?fref=ts
It started when Richard Butcher, who used to be in a band called Ti -
ger Weather, met Eliel Cotz and they discovered their shared interests in 
music. They befriended Justin and Cristian Molina and Jared Oberg and started jamming out with their eclectic array of instruments. They formed the band in January and started playing shows at Pascal’s Coffee House and Baptist Collegiate Ministries. They released their song “Geese” on iTunes at the end of March.
Members of The Old Country practice wherever they can, said Cotz, 
lead singer and guitarist. They like to rehearse on Turlington Plaza when it hollows out. Cotz creates the skeletons of the songs, and the other mem -
bers help flesh them out. They’re working on a new song called “The Eve -
ning Lights” for their next show in West Palm Beach. Cotz said he gathered inspiration for the song’s tune from a hymn.
The songs are part of an effort to create an EP. With lilting melodies, a 
twinkling glockenspiel and Cotz’s voice — akin to Adam Young’s of Owl City — the tunes would be a perfect soundtrack for a road trip or a semi-serious study session. The music is full of bells and whistles but also contains lyrical depth. The members are united under one purpose: “As Christians, we want to be able to relate to people and let them feel loved, just as we’ve been loved,” Cotz said.THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013

Gators in the MLB Draft
Major League Baseball’s First-Year Player Draft begins tonight at 7 p.m. 
Eligible Gators include starting pitcher Jonathon Crawford, inﬁ  elder Cody Dent, relief pitcher Daniel Gibson and ﬁ  rst baseman Vickash Ramjit. Eddie Lovett dealt with tragedy as he became one of UF’s top athletes. Read the story 
on page 24.Ryan Jones / Alligator Staff
Jay Carmichael pitches against Florida Gulf Coast on Feb. 24. Carmichael ﬁ  nished the season with the Gators’ third best ERA.
  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  The season started well.
  Florida won three of its ﬁ  rst four 
games, including a 16-5 blowout of Duke to clinch the ﬁ  rst series of the season in front of 3,581 fans at McK-ethan Stadium.
  Then, the ﬁ  rst losing streak hit. 
Florida lost a midweek game to Geor-gia Southern in extra innings before being swept by Florida Gulf Coast – a team Florida had beaten in six of their seven prior meetings.
  “It’s a long season,” senior Cody 
Dent said after the sweep. 
  It only got longer.  The Gators fell to 3-7 to start the 
season after losing three games to the Eagles, a midweek game to the North Florida Ospreys and the series opener to the Hurricanes. Florida wouldn’t crawl back over .500 until April 12.
  Nothing went well for the Gators in the ﬁ  rst months of the season. Pitching was hard to ﬁ  nd. Junior Jonathon Crawford struggled to ﬁ  nd consistency. In his ﬁ  rst six starts of the season, he gave up three, zero, eight, nine, three and 12 hits. He didn’t notch his ﬁ  rst win of the season until he blanked Ole Miss in a complete-game shutout on March 30.
  Despite being the only upperclass-
man starter on the team, he was de-moted to the No. 2 spot in the rotation in March.
  The the other starters struggled as 
well.
  Freshman Jay Carmichael moved 
from the bullpen to the rotation to the Friday slot after a string of solid out-ings, but he battled through arm inju-ries for the next month.
  Eric Hanhold, Bobby Poyner, 
Tucker Simpson and Danny Young all made seven or more starts and had ﬂ  ashes of brilliance, but none could make a lasting impact as start-ers. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan shuttled them back and forth between the rota-tion and the bullpen.
  “The thing that’s most disappoint-
ing up to this point is I don’t think we’ve seen the improvement with some players we thought we would,” O’Sullivan said.
  The situation was just as dire in the 
starting lineup. 
  With the exodus of most of the 
2012 team to professional baseball, the Gators had many holes to ﬁ  ll. Some underclassmen ﬁ  lled their roles well.
  Freshman Richie Martin came in 
to replace Nolan Fontana at shortstop. He started the season well before suf-fering a ﬁ  nger injury. When he came back, he moved to the outﬁ  eld, leav-ing Dent and his sub-.200 average in the starting lineup at shortstop.
  Fellow ﬁ  rst-year Harrison Bader 
hit above .300 and provided speed on the base paths, leading the team with 15 steals.
  But the power was never there.   Sophomore Taylor Gushue 
needed to ﬁ  ll the exceptionally large cleats of Mike Zunino, and he didn’t. He ﬁ  nished the year with ﬁ  ve home

LANDON PUNCHES
 Tim Walton is a man of the present, not the future.
  After Florida’s 3-0 loss to Texas eliminated it 
from the Women’s College World Series, the UF 
coach praised his team’s successful 2013 season and un-
derplayed the potential of next year’s squad.
    Walton wanting to relish in the moment is under-
standable, but how could he not be excited about next year’s team?
  Florida loses only two seniors – outﬁ  elder Kelsey 
Horton and pinch runner Ensley Gammel – and returns eight of its nine starters from a 2013 team that won 58 games, cruised to the Southeastern Conference title and earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 
  For a talented Gators squad with such a high ceiling, 
next year’s expectations will be national championship or bust.  
  Florida brings back a solid rotation of right-handers, 
which features National Fastpitch Coaches Associa-tion’s All-American First Team selections Hannah Rog-ers and Lauren Haeger, and Alyssa Bache at No. 3. 
  Despite a rocky outing at the WCWS, Rogers ﬁ  n-
ished the year with a 1.71 ERA – 35th in the nation. Haeger ﬁ  nished the year with an ERA of 2.35. As Flori-da’s cleanup hitter, the sophomore led the Gators with 18 homers. 
  Florida’s young inﬁ  eld had a year to mesh and 
should be even more in tune next season. The Gators return Taylor Schwarz at ﬁ  rst, Kelsey Stewart at second, Stephanie Tofft at third and Katie Medina at shortstop. 
  The three basemen, Haeger and freshman center 
ﬁ  elder Kirsti Merritt combined to hit ..322 in 2013. 
  Medina struggled at the plate in her ﬁ  rst year as a 
starter, but the sophomore thrived on defense in the NCAA Tournament and proved her worth at the po-sition. If Medina fails to im-prove offensively in 2014, UF can still use Bailey Castro as a pinch hitter. 
  Collectively, Florida ﬁ  n-
ished the season ranked 112th in the country in batting aver-age (.278). That number should only improve next season. 
  Florida’s two catchers should split innings next year. 
Freshman Taylore Fuller saw her hitting improve as the 
year progressed, batting .364 and tallying two of UF’s ﬁ  ve home runs in the NCAAs.
  Aubree Munro carved a niche as a defensive special-
ist in her ﬁ  rst year as a Gator. 
  Sophomores Briana Little and Jessica Damico, who 
both came up big in extras during Florida’s 15-inning thriller against Nebraska on Saturday, should also share playing time in 2014. 
   UF will add four newcomers in 2014 – freshmen 
Delanie Gourley, Justine McLean and Chelsea Hern-don, and Daytona Junior College transfer Francesca Martinez.
  Gourley, a left-handed pitcher, will provide a new 
dimension to Florida’s pitching group. 
  It’s likely that at least one of the four additions will 
break out and contribute immediately in 2014. Three Gators freshmen started at least 57 contests in 2013. Plus, Walton never guarantees anything – he loves to leave competition open at each position. 
    The future looks bright for the Gators – even if Wal-
ton doesn’t want to take his shades off just yet.

  The ﬁ  rst day of the 2013 
NCAA Outdoor Champion-
ships in Eugene, Ore., had some ups and downs for the Gators.
  Florida’s women have 
eight points after Wednes-day and are tied for seventh in the standings. The men have not had any events scored yet.
  “Overall, we had a solid 
day, but we did have some things that could have gone much better,” coach Mike Holloway said. ’”
  Freshman Marija Vucen-
ovic earned eight points, ﬁ  n-ishing second in the women’s javelin throw with a distance of 54.76 meters. 
  Senior Ugonna Ndu won 
her heat in the 400m hurdles. With a time of 57.05 seconds, Ndu automatically advances to Friday’s ﬁ  nals. Ndu is also competing in the women’s 100m hurdles tomorrow. 
  Half of the men’s 4x400m relay squad advanced in their individual events. Ar-man Hall and Hugh Graham, Jr. advanced in the men’s 400 meters. Hall’s time of 45.50 seconds is a personal colle-giate best.
  Florida’s only relay squad 
– the men’s 4x100 meters – also came through for Flor-ida, winning its heat with a time of 38.77 seconds.
  Of the 13 athletes compet-
ing in individual events, only four advanced. 
  Florida will not have any 
competitors in the men’s 800m, 3,000m steeplechase, women’s long jump, 400m, 100m, and 10,000m. 
  Of those who did not 
qualify, the most surprising were the competitors in the women’s 400m: Lanie Whit-taker and Ebony Eutsey. 
  Eutsey had the 18th-fast-
est time in the country. Three of the eight qualiﬁ  ers in the event were ranked lower than Eutsey.

Florida to play in Madison Square Garden
The UF men’s basketball team will play Memphis in the 
Jimmy V Men’s Basketball Classic in New York on Dec. 17 as part of the seventh annual Jimmy V Week.runs – four fewer than Zunino hit in any season at 
Florida.
  “We got to get better offensively,” O’Sullivan 
said. “We have not put good swings in offensive counts and did enough damage there.”
  For a stretch in April, it looked like Florida had 
ﬁ  nally put it together. The Gators beat the Semi-noles on the road and swept the Gamecocks at home. They won 11 out of 12 games to jump out to a 25-19 record by April 27. 
  But it was not meant to be.   LSU swept Florida in Baton Rouge, and UF 
limped its way into the Southeastern Conference  Tournament after losing four of its last six. The team did not win a game in the postseason, los-ing the opener of the SEC Tournament and going home after two games in the NCAA Bloomington Regional – the earliest exit for Florida since 2008. O’Sullivan was not satisﬁ  ed.
  “This season is not the standard we want at 
Florida,” O’Sullivan said. “There’s no rebuilding at Florida … We’ve got young players, but it’s time to grow up.”

  The 2012-13 campaign yielded 
positive results for Florida, but it end-
ed with a disappointing ﬁ  nal act on May 30. The Gators placed 25th at the NCAA championships in Woodstock, Ga. 
  UF started its fall season on a posi-
tive note, looking dominant with a win in its ﬁ  rst tournament and ﬁ  nishing second in the next two tournaments. 
  “It was a great way to start the 
year,” coach Buddy Alexander said in a release following the season-open-ing victory at The Invitational at The Ocean Course in Kiawah Island, S.C. 
At that tournament, the Gators 
dominated the ﬁ  eld and won by a 24-stroke margin, scoring 882 (+18).
  After back-to-back second-place 
ﬁ  nishes, Florida ﬁ  nished its fall sea-son with a sixth-place effort at the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational in Windermere. While the ﬁ  nish looked bad on the leaderboard, UF’s play in the tournament was consistent with its early play, scoring 886 (+18), 12 strokes off its fall average of 874. 
  But Florida could not to play to 
the level of a more competitive ﬁ  eld, which featured powers such as Cali-fornia, 2012 national champion Tex-as, 2013 national ﬁ  nalist Illinois and eventual 2013 national champion, Alabama.
  In the spring, the Gators made a 
habit of ﬁ  nishing fourth, doing so in four out of ﬁ  ve tournaments, includ-ing the SunTrust Gator Invitational, a tournament Florida hosted at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. The Gators’ worst effort of the spring season came in the Southern Highlands Collegiate Masters in Las Vegas, where they ﬁ  n-ished eighth. 
  Florida’s postseason began on a 
disastrous note with a 10th-place ﬁ  n-ish in the Southeastern Conference Championships.
  “Other than Tyler [McCumber], 
there were not many positives,” Al-exander said. “We need to take a look in the mirror. Right now, we have to restore some conﬁ  dence and get back on right the path.” 
Florida shot 40 strokes over par as a team, and the Gators could not build any momentum toward the NCAA Regionals a month later. 
  Florida also failed to claim a sec-
ond conference championship in three years. Instead, the team found itself last on the leaderboard after the ﬁ  rst day of competition, and the results didn’t get much better in the subse-quent round. UF ﬁ  nished the third round with a score of 290, tied for the best score of the round.
  With a month to stew on the dis-
appointment of the SECs, Florida performed well at the NCAA South Regional in Baton Rouge and ﬁ  nished second behind only Alabama. By ﬁ  n-ishing in the top 5, Florida secured a spot in the NCAA Championships.
  “What happened at the SEC’s was 
a ﬂ  uke, we’ve never played that bad and it’s not going to happen again,” senior T.J. Vogel said. 
But   Florida’s performance in Baton 
Rouge did not translate to the NCAA Championships. UF fell short of the eighth-place cutoff for the match-play portion of the tournament, ending the season with little fanfare. 
 Florida ends season empty-handedTHURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 23
THE RALLY
 The NBA is nearing the end of its two-
month haul through the postseason, and 
Miami Heat forward LeBron James has 
continued his dominance through the Eastern Conference Finals. As James leads his team into the Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, alligatorSports editors Adam Lichtenstein and Landon Watnick will decide which Florida player dominates or dominated his or her game in a LeBron-esque fashion.
    Adam: Choosing a player who can turn 
their game on like LeBron is tough. James is arguably the most dominant athlete in any sport in the world, except for maybe Lionel Messi. 
  But speaking of Messi, Florida’s most 
dominant athlete shares a sport with him. That player is none other than former Gators forward Erika Tymrak. 
  Tymrak, a two-time All-American, led 
Florida to its most successful season in years, notching a Southeastern Conference regular season title and the SEC tourna-ment title on her way out.
  Like LeBron, she led her team in pretty 
much every relevant category – goals, as-sists and shots on goal to name a few.
  The Gators are going to miss her when 
they try to start offensive attacks next sea-son. Havana Solaun and Annie Speese are good, but they don’t have the dynamism and pure skill Tymrak brought to the pitch.
    Landon: LeBron is one of the most ef-
ﬁ  cient shooters in the league and leads his team in nearly every statistical category. He ﬁ  nished the regular season second on Miami with a 56.5 percent shooting, which is absolutely insane for a highly utilized forward like him.
  On the other 
hand, Tymrak ﬁ  n-ished 2012 with a 13.2 shooting per-centage – second worst of Gators who took at least 20 shots. 
  But there is a basketball player on this 
campus as valuable to her team as LeBron is to the Heat. 
  Her name is Sydney Moss. You prob-
ably know her father, Randy.
  Moss plays both shooting guard and 
small forward – LeBron’s natural posi-tion. 
The 5-foot-11 rising sophomore bullies 
her defenders with physicality and quick-ness – just like how her dad did back in the early 2000s and how LeBron will against Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard these next two weeks. 
  Our women’s basketball writer, Phil 
Heilman, would deﬁ  nitely agree with me on this. He even wrote an article back in March comparing Moss’ skillset to LeB-ron’s. 
    Adam: While Moss may share some 
traits with LeBron, where was the success? The Gators went to the WNIT – LeBron’s teams compete for championships.
  Tymrak’s team dominated the competi-
tion in the SEC Tournament like the Heat dominated the Bucks and Bulls in the ﬁ  rst two rounds of the playoffs – if you can re-member that far back.
  Florida outscored opponents 8-1 in the 
tourney, and Tymrak led the way. 
She scored in each game as the Gators stormed into the NCAA Tournament. It was clear Tymrak was the best player on the pitch in those games. 
  However, Moss 
wasn’t even Flor-ida’s top scoring 
threat – that would be Jaterra Bonds. 
She wasn’t the Gators’ best rebounder, 
either. That honor goes to the Indiana Fe-ver’s new forward, Jennifer George.
  Moss was a solid all-around player on a 
mediocre team. Tymrak was the top player on a very good team. 
  Landon: Moss is still young and has 
loads of potential. She’s basically LeBron back in the good ol’ Cleveland days. Right now, she has no help. 
  With a crop of highly touted recruits 
and transfers joining coach Amanda But-ler’s squad in 2013-14, Moss should get plenty of assistance. 
  Moss rounded into form at the end of 
the season and proved why she’s Florida’s best player. She started the last 16 games of her freshman season, leading the Gators in points (16.7), rebounds (8.1) and assists (4.7) per game in UF’s ﬁ  nal 10 contests. She shot 48.3 percent from the ﬁ  eld during that stretch. 
  Her dominance in every statistical cate-
gory during the latter half of the year rings one name: LeBron. 
  Moss was also the only Gator to exceed 
the 25-point threshold twice this year.
  I know I’m focusing primarily on the 
end of 2012-13, but I’m looking to the fu-ture.  Tymrak may have led her team in 2012 
with nine goals and 12 assists, but she took a team-high 68 shots. This was Tymrak at the peak of her college career.
  Moss didn’t dominate during the be-
ginning of her freshman season, but she improved exponentially and will only get better over the next three seasons. 
You’ll soon witness that.    Adam: LeBron was far and away the 
best player with Cleveland. Moss was not the best player on her team last year, and all the incoming talent you mentioned will make sure she won’t be the best player on the team for the next three years.
  Tymrak’s stats weren’t awe-inspiring, 
but the talent she showed on the ﬁ  eld set her apart from the rest of the team.
  Like LeBron’s dunk on Jason Terry ear-
lier in the year, Tymrak dominated her op-ponents.
  Whether she was feeding passes to 
McKenzie Barney or dribbling around opponents, Tymrak made her minutes count.
  Not only was she a dangerous scorer, 
she was a dangerous passer. She had a knack for delivering inside passes to for-wards and putting them in position to score. She led the Gators in assists in three of her four seasons.
  LeBron leads the Heat in assists, as well 
as points and rebounds. Tymrak led the Gators in goals, assists and game-winning goals.
  Moss led the team in assists – barely.  Which one sounds more like LeBron?  Contact Adam Lichtenstein at alichten-
stein@alligator.org. Contact Landon Watnick at lwatnick@alligator.org.

From baseball in Miami to football in West 
Palm Beach and track in Gainesville, junior 
Eddie Lovett has stayed busy his entire life. 
Lovett is the three-time reigning Southeast-
ern Conference and NCAA champion in the men’s 60m hurdles. Lovett set the fourth fast-est time in collegiate history when he clocked a time of 7.50 seconds at the NCAA Indoor Champioships this year, but he had never planned to step foot on a track.
Born in Miami to a mother who played high 
school basketball and a father who played mi-nor league baseball, Lovett was destined to become an athlete.
Lovett’s father, Eddie Williams, was a 
second-round draft selection for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1991. Williams showed consider-able promise as a prospect, being named to USA Today’s 1991 Super 25 along with future MLB stars Manny Ramirez, Shawn Green, Cliff Floyd and Dmitri Young. Had it not been for a car accident in 1993, Williams might have reached his full potential. 
Lovett’s first athletic venture was baseball, 
but his foray into the sport was short-lived. His first real passion was football. Track wasn’t even on his radar.  
“I played football my whole life,” he said. 
“I never thought about running track. When I was in the sixth grade, I went out on the track one day. Back then, I was super skinny, and they thought I was a distance runner. I was doing like four, five, six laps, and I was like, ‘No, this is not what I want,’ so I quit.”
After living in Miami for much of his child-
hood, Lovett and his family moved to West Palm Beach.  
“My mom just wanted to get out of [Mi-
ami]. There was a lot of stuff dealing with my family, so she just wanted to relocate,” Lovett said. 
Lovett said the move was ultimately good 
for him, but he struggled with the transition.
“It was different at first. I didn’t have the 
family that I had (in Miami),” he said. “I had to learn to adjust to the people, especially the girls. ”
The move to West Palm Beach catalyzed 
Lovett’s athletic career. Football was still at the forefront for Lovett, who thrived on the fresh-man and then the varsity team.. 
 Football was his top priority. He did not 
start running track until he was a sophomore at Palm Beach Lakes High.  
“My first time winning the state title (as a 
junior), I was thinking about transferring to Dwyer just to play football,” he said. “I talked to my family, and at the last second, I decided to stay. That summer, I went in really focused on football.” 
But Lovett’s focus on football was for 
naught. He suffered a broken arm three games into his senior season.
“I didn’t know what to do,” Lovett said. “I 
didn’t know how I was going to play football. What if broke my arm again? What if it was going to affect me in track?”
With football out of the picture, Lovett switched his focus to track and dominated.
As a senior, he broke a 20-year-old FHSAA 
record in the boys’ 110m hurdles, winning the 
Class 3A championship in a time of 13.46 sec-onds, which led the nation. 
Florida coach Mike Holloway took notice. “I actually got a call from one of the alum-
ni’s father,” Holloway said. “Then, I got a call from (Olympian and former Gator) Tony Mc-Quay’s high school coach (Carnell Coleman). He told me, ‘There’s a guy down here that you need to take a look at.’”
Holloway’s network of trusted colleagues 
raved about Lovett’s talent. Lovett’s coach at Palm Beach Lakes, Jerome Groover, had the highest praise for the senior hurdler.
“I’ve known Eddie’s high school coach 
since I was a high school coach,” Holloway said. “Jerome told me, ‘Look, I think this might be the best guy I’ve ever had,’ which is saying a lot, because he’s had some good ones.”
Lovett’s talent and Groover’s confidence 
resulted in a scholarship offer.
After arriving at Florida, Lovett lived up to the lofty expectations set by those around him. His freshman year, he became an SEC champion and Men’s Indoor Freshman Track & Field Runner of the Year. He was the SEC champion again his sophomore year, and he was the youngest competitor in the men’s 110m hurdles at the U.S. Olympic Trials, mak-ing it all the way to the semifinals. Lovett’s PR of 13.49 at the trials moved him into second all-time in Florida school history. 
Lovett’s trajectory was skyrocketing at UF. 
It was a comeback story for an athlete who had broken his arm and almost lost all hope for a future in sports. 
But all the success and accolades Lovett 
had merited were suddenly put on hold last summer.
On July 18, 2012, a little over a week after 
posting a top-five finish at nationals, Lovett’s father was shot and killed in his native Virgin Islands. Williams was found unresponsive in the drivers’ seat of his car that morning. 
Perhaps the most heartbreaking detail was 
that Lovett was rekindling what was once a tumultuous relationship with his father. With a heavy heart, Lovett has continued to perform this season. He set a meet record at the Indoor Championships in March.       “The minute you get complacent is the minute you make a mistake and look like a fool,” he said. “I’m never satisfied. Even when I have good practices, I feel like I could’ve done better. I’m really competitive. I’m cool and laid back, but if you give me a challenge I’ll probably show you out.”       Added  Holloway: “Eddie is the kind of guy where he could have a perfect start and still say it wasn’t.”
Lovett’s success has not surprised Hollo-
way. The Gators coach knew he could trust Groover’s advice.
“A hurdler is a sprinter with an attitude, 
and that describes Eddie Lovett to a T,” Hol-loway said. “He’s a sprinter with an attitude when it comes to the sticks. He’s fast. He’s ag-gressive. You can’t be fearful and be a great hurdler. You can’t be afraid of the sticks.”
Since his football career ended premature-
ly, Lovett shifted his focus to track and earned results. Although he has already won big at Florida, he has set his sights even higher. 
Lovett will compete in his third NCAA 
Outdoor Championship in as many years to-night at 8:20; he will run in the prelims in the 110m hurdles – his only event.
“I know what it feels like to hunt,” Lovett 
said. “My mentality is: ‘I’m No. 1 in the NCAA, but I’m not No. 1 in the U.S. I’m not No. 1 in the world.’”24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 6, 2013
