  The stroll through the Plaza of 
the Americas today will be much 
cooler thanks to UF and the Flor-ida Lottery.
  From 11 a.m. to noon, the two 
groups will host a free ice cream social for new and returning Bright Futures recipients.
  This is the ﬁ  rst time the 
Florida Lottery has held an ice cream social at UF, said Cyn-thia O’Connell, secretary of the Florida Lottery and former UF Trustee.
  O’Connell said she originally contacted the Ofﬁ  ce of Student Affairs with the idea, and she hopes students know how much the Florida Lottery is proud of 
the work they are doing at UF.
  Students who attend can 
learn more about the connection 
between Bright Futures and the Florida Lottery, she said.
  The Florida Lottery funds 90 
percent of Bright Futures schol-
arships, and that donation aids 
about 500,000 students through-out Florida, O’Connell said.
  Winn-Dixie will donate about 
600 servings of ice cream.
  In addition to receiving free 
ice cream, students  can enter to win prizes such as T-shirts and movie passes.

  Gerald Kish was a movie 
buff, a sci-ﬁ   enthusiast and the 
guy picked ﬁ  rst for trivia teams. 
  He had a crazy tie collection, 
an almost unnavigable ofﬁ  ce and the perfect story for every occasion.
  He touched the lives of 
friends, coworkers, students and community members alike during his life. 
  Last Friday, while scuba div-
ing in Cozumel, Mexico, Kish suffered a heart attack underwa-ter and drowned, according to 
a Mexican medical examiner’s 
report. 
He was 54.   In Gainesville, Kish worked 
as an adjunct professor for UF, 
teaching courses in public speak-
ing, argumentation, comedy and pop culture. 
  “He was one of the few teach-
ers I’ve had in college who actu-ally cared about each individual student,” said Greg Taylor, a 
public relations junior who took 
a business communications 
course with 
Kish. “He was a great guy.”
  Kish also 
worked at the North Florida E v a l u a t i o n and Treatment 
Center — a fa-
cility for people who are judged 
incompetent to proceed to trial or who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity.
  Here, he was the director of 
continuity of care, orchestrating patients’ admissions and dis-charges from the center. 
He made living and care ar-rangements for the patients who were released back into the com-
munity. 
  Kish had phenomenal speak-
ing and people skills, making 
him very good at dealing with patients, said Bill Baxter, the 
center’s administrator.
  “He had a terriﬁ  c sense of hu-
mor — he could tell a joke better 
than anyone else,” Baxter said. 
“He could speak on any subject 
at the drop of a hat. Even if he made it all up, it would still be convincing.”
  Kish worked hard to better 
the lives of mentally ill people 
involved in the criminal justice 
system by teaching attorneys, judges, mental health provid-ers and law enforcement ofﬁ  cers 
around the state about the foren-
sic mental health system.
  In Alachua County, he helped 
establish the Crisis Intervention Team training that hundreds of 
police ofﬁ  cers have since gone Professor dies while scuba diving

  Beat FSU! is the idea behind Operation Cover-Up 
Gainesville, a new UF Student Alumni Association com-
munity-service project. 
  A different kind of match-up, the clothing drive was 
launched Sept. 1 as a competition between UF and Florida 
State University to see which university could collect the 
most donations before the UF-FSU football game.
  “We thought that competing against FSU would bring 
a friendly competitive spirit while providing valuable beneﬁ  ts to both our communities,” said Rachel Johnson, the Alumni Association’s director of membership and marketing. 
  Bragging rights are also involved, she said.  The winning university will be recognized Nov. 26 
during the UF-FSU football game.
  Clothes can be dropped off until Nov . 22 at Emerson 
Hall, 1938 W. University Ave., Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Donations also are accepted during any SAA BEAT T-shirt giveaway or at any Gainesville Domino’s Pizza location.
  The clothes will be donated to local charities, includ-
ing the Salvation Army and St. Francis House. Children’s clothes will be sent to students at underprivileged elemen-
tary schools in Gainesville, according to Johnson. UF, FSU race to

Gerald Kish, an adjunct professor at UF, died last Friday while scuba diving in Mexico. This photo was taken at a 
public-speaking forum on March 26, 2009.through to be better pre-
pared to handle a situation involving adults or children 
with mental illnesses.
Baxter said Alachua 
County Sheriff Sadie Dar -
nell called him Tuesday to let him know how important 
Kish’s work was to the com-munity and how much he will be missed.
“He was so doggone 
cool,” said Kellie Roberts, the interim director for UF’s Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication and 
Kish’s longtime friend. “He 
was one of the smartest guys I’ve ever known.” 
She described him as one 
of those people who could 
relate to anybody.
“If you met him on a bus, 
before you got off you’d be 
his buddy,” she said. “He 
had so many friends.” 
She wasn’t exaggerating.
Earlier this week, a man 
emailed Roberts to express his shock and condolences — he had eaten dinner with 
Kish only one time.
“He was an absolutely 
marvelous human being in 
every sense of the word,” said the woman who answered 
the phone at the North Flori-
da Evaluation and Treatment Center. “He was my walking Google.” 
Everyone has a short list 
of people they know they can count on no matter what, 
Roberts said.
And with the passing of 
her friend of 30 years — “I 
have one less person on that 
list.”
Kish is survived by his 
mother and his two sisters.
Roberts said she expects 
the memorial service to take place sometime in October.Professor remembered

Waves of sweet basil, the feel-
ing of grains beneath one’s feet 
and soil buried deep into the cracks and crevices of the skin are all forms of art, according to two 
UF fine arts students. 
With their art installation, “Op-
posing Growth,” Rachael Kerley, 
29, a student in the department of art and technology, and Giang Lien Pham, 25, a sculpture stu-dent, hope to change the average  perception of art.
The exhibit, which is held in 
the art gallery on the second floor of the Reitz Union, begins at 7 p.m. today.
Guests are welcome to smell 
and taste herbs, walk barefoot across exhibits and take home 
sprouts growing hydroponically 
in recovered water bottles.
“You’re not a detached viewer anymore,” Kerley said. “We’re inviting action, and in that we are highlighting that action as art.”
The exhibit comprises five 
pieces all intertwined by themes of life, nature and society. One of the pieces, an herb garden, repre-sents the trend of urban garden-ing and a return to knowing food and where it is coming from.
One of the main inspirations 
behind the exhibit was the lack of 
human interaction with the envi-
ronment.
“It’s alive, and our connection 
to it is dwindling,” Kerley said. “That is a big part of the thread that runs through each piece: try-ing to connect to this living entity all around us.”After collaborating on previ-
ous projects, Kerley and Pham re-alized they had similar goals and views regarding contemporary 
and instillation art and wanted 
to showcase this viewpoint to the Gainesville community.
The artists feel so strongly 
about the human interaction in-volved with their work that they were happy to find someone had walked across one of the exhibits, leaving footprints in the soil.
“I really like works that are 
interactive and works that the au-dience can touch and feel,” Pham said. “We always have this idea that art should be portioned off, or roped off and viewed from a distance, but I like the intimate experience.”
The exhibit will remain open 
to the public, free of charge, until Sept. 13.
“I want to make this exhibition 
opening an event,” Pham said. “It’s not just another opening where you go and view it, and the art is just passive. This is an event, and there is something happen-ing.”

Ford Motor Co. and Zipcar  
have reached an agreement to 
bring Ford-model Zipcars to 
campus.
This alliance between Zipcar 
and Ford will  introduce college 
students to the new Ford Focus 
and Ford Escape models and al-
low students to witness firsthand their high-fuel efficiency.
The Ford-model cars are not 
only fuel efficient but high-tech 
as well, which is another factor 
believed to draw college students to the new models.
According to a press release 
sent Wednesday by Matt Camer -
on, member services associate for universities at Zipcar, the com-pany will feature Ford models on more than 250 college campuses.
Zipcar members will be able 
to rent the new Ford-model cars on an hourly or daily basis with-out the added cost of gas and car insurance because these features 
will be included in the rental 
cost.
Students, faculty and staff can 
buy a Zipcar membership for $25 
and receive $35 worth of driving 
time. 
Gainesville residents not af-
filiated with UF may also register with Zipcar and have access to 
the new Ford models.

Mariel Manuel, a freshman biology major 
and a Bright Futures recipient, can’t attend 
but said she’s never been to an event that has celebrated Bright Future students. 
“I think it’s a good idea because students 
worked hard to get Bright Futures, and it’s getting harder each year, so it’s good the lot-tery is supporting them,” Manuel said.
Myra Morgan, the director of external re-
lations for the UF Division of Student Affairs, said she encourages all students in the area to stop by . 
“It’s a way for students to understand how 
the Bright Futures is funded, meet Secretary O’Connell and get free ice cream,” she said. THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

In previous years, the Student Alumni 
Association has done a food drive during 
the fall semester. This will be Operation 
Cover-Up’s first year. 
“We brought back a variety of commu-nity-service project ideas from a recent conference for student alumni asso-ciations, and the concept of Operation Cover-Up 
Gainesville came from that,” Johnson said. 
One student is al-
ready getting excited about the prospect of beating FSU. 
Telecommunications sophomore Kelsey 
Branz said she has a lot of clothes she will be donating to the drive. 
“I went through my old clothes this sum-
mer and was going to donate them to Good-will, but this is a cause of equal stature,” she said.  “Besides, we’re obviously going to 
beat FSU in football, so we might as well 
beat them in the clothing drive, too.”cOver-up , from page 1� THE COURSE HAS NOT

The Openwater Scuba Div-
ing class at UF has resurfaced 
this fall. 
The class was canceled in 
May 2009 because it no longer 
fit the direction of the College 
of Heath and Human Perfor -mance, said Cheryl Thacker, the course’s former director.
“The program itself was 
well-attended and highly de-sired,” Thacker said. “It has been restored in a new light 
and new direction.”
The class was reopened as 
part of the School of Forest Re-
sources and Conservation by professor Douglas Marcinek, who said he saw the oppor -
tunity to propose a new series of courses that focused on the development of scientific re-search divers. 
The diving class works 
in collaboration with the UF Gator Scuba Club, which edu-cates students on diver safety.
UF also offers Advanced 
Scuba Diving, Scuba Diving Leadership 1 and Scuba Div-ing Leadership 2. Each course introduces divers to new methods and dive locations and prepares students for Di-vemaster Certification tests. 
“Our focus is on offering 
our students the highest level of training available any-where,” Marcinek said, “and, 
in turn, demanding from them 
the effort required so that we are producing the safest and most competent divers of any program on the planet.”UF scuba diving class returns this fall

Today’s question: Are you going to the ice cream social 
for Bright Futures recipients?
Wednesday’s question: Have you ever 
plagiarized or cheated on an assignment?
69 TOTAL VOTES48% YES
52% NOLawfully ludicrous
Florida should get 
rid of silly laws
If you live with your significant other and don’t happen to be 
married, you could be committing a crime in Florida.
In the last year, 104 people have been charged with a mis-
demeanor for violating this vital law. 
In the last five years, approximately 700 people have been 
charged. 
What possible harm could result from people of the opposite 
sex living together? Usually couples who decide to live together out of wedlock are doing so out of a sense of love, comfort and commitment to one another. 
What problems does the state have with two people engag-
ing in such a commitment? 
Surely we have not allowed these moral dictators to use re-
ligion to argue for the continuation of this archaic statute, have 
we? 
Section 3 of Florida’s Declaration of Rights states, “There shall 
be no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting 
or penalizing the free exercise thereof.”
Even if one were to try to defend this law as promoting pub-
lic health and safety , there could be no possible public concern in not letting two people of the opposite sex live together. 
There are a lot of laws on the books in Florida that have noth-
ing to do with safety or some religious doctrine. 
For instance, on Thursdays, it is illegal to fart in a public place 
after 6 p.m. So if you and your significant other have just left your apartment for a night on the town (he or she just came to pick you up because you don’t live together or anything), you better take some anti-gas medication. 
It is also illegal in Florida to leave your elephant tied to a 
parking meter without paying, have sex with a porcupine, mo-lest a trash can in Daytona Beach, set off torpedoes in Destin and have sex in other positions besides missionary.
Gainesville is probably full of people who have violated at 
least three of these absurd laws above. We’ll let you figure out which three.  
What do lawmakers hope to accomplish by passing such ab-
surd and invasive laws? Most of these are unenforceable or so strange that they would never have to be enforced. 
The state, like everywhere else in the country, is in a budget 
bind. One has to wonder whether the state is dusting off some of these old, asinine laws to raise revenue. 
Imagine how much money the state could raise if it started 
fining people for farting in public. The state could raise hun-dreds of thousands of dollars just by knocking on every door in Gainesville to catch those immoral cohabitants. 
All of these mundane laws need to be taken off of the books 
immediately . 
State Rep. Ritch Workman tried to pass a bill to get the co-
habitation law off of the books last year but was shot down be-cause others in Tallahassee thought the issue was too politically 
sensitive to touch. 
Politically sensitive to whom? Grandma may not like you living with your boyfriend, but 
it’s certainly no business of the state.Steve Jobs is done.
The CEO of one of the world’s top corporations 
resigned. Following his departure, Apple Inc. stocks 
plummeted. Faith in the technology giant fell. And even 
though any business major here at UF will tell you that Ap-
ple will quickly recover and remain as strong as ever, you can’t quite shake the feeling that maybe this is the beginning of the end.
And if Apple falls, who might be next? Microsoft Corp.? 
Google? Facebook?
Ah, Facebook. Like Apple, it’s not going away any time 
soon. But unlike Apple, we all like to talk about how much 
we wish it would. 
Sure, we use it every single day (usually multiple times a 
day). You’ve probably already checked it at least once since 
opening this paper. It’s as critical to our daily lives as email, texting or phone calls. Yet one of our favorite pastimes is bashing Facebook like it’s that drunk uncle who ruins family reunions.
But why? What claim do we have? Its glitches are the 
result of it being immensely popular. It’s the same reason YouTube will screw up every now and then. Every time it changes, we run around like the sky is falling, but then we realize the change is probably for the better. We come to em-brace it like it was part of the program all along. 
And as much as we may try to resent Mark Zuckerberg, 
we’ve seen “The Social Network,” and we can’t help but like the guy.
No, the complaint we always come back to hinges on pri-
vacy concerns. Because of the advent of social networking like Facebook, privacy has become an almost archaic term. 
Our words are plastered all over the Internet (along with 
our contact information, date of birth, family tree and, worst of all, our secret hobbies). 
Photos of us are posted every hour. If we’re particularly 
unfortunate, that video that got recorded last night that we really hoped would never see the light of day will be upload-
ed the next morning. Our lives are no longer private. And we assume that it’s an aw-
ful, terrible thing. But if you stop 
to think about it, you might realize it’s really not so bad. 
We do like our privacy . We 
want to know that we can do things without anyone being aware we’ve done them. It’s a val-ue that’s been socially ingrained in us since childhood. But it’s also 
the very thing that allows for dishonesty , for deception, for bold-faced lies. Without privacy , we’re forced to be ourselves. 
We can no longer put up the facade of being something we’re 
not.
The fact is, we spend so much of our time hiding our dif-
ferences and shying away from admitting who we really are. We pretend. We’re fake. Privacy enables that; it empowers our fraud.
When privacy deteriorates, so too does our ability to lie 
to each other. We start to embrace each other’s differences. We’re forced to accept others despite their quirks because ev-eryone has them, and nobody will be able to hide them. 
Crimes become nearly impossible to perpetrate, and the 
crime we commit every day — the crime of lying about our true selves — becomes an artifact of a dark past.
And sure, the pretty girl in your organic chemistry class 
will easily be able to find out that you like Halo a bit too much. But that just means when you get the nerve to talk to her and she accepts your offer for coffee, it’s because she 
genuinely likes you and appreciates your honesty. You get to 
build a relationship on sincerity.
So maybe Facebook and everything it represents isn’t the 
devil. Because it’s when we’re finally forced to be honest with each other that we can finally start being honest with ourselves.

The world watched as The Gator Nation 
got a firsthand lesson in fist pumping and 
“twinning” when the UF College of Journal-
ism and Communications sponsored a study 
abroad trip in Florence during the summer semester. 
Twins Brittany and Erica Taltos, 22, 
are advertising seniors and most recently known for their stint on season four of “Jer -sey Shore.” 
Members of the Ad Society, former Di-
vision I Cross Country and Track and Field participants and employees at Red Mango, these girls stress the fact that they are just 
like any other UF student.
“The thing is, we have an above 3.5 GPA, 
and we went on study abroad to have fun 
and put it on our resume,” Brittany Taltos 
said. “Partying was just an aside. It’s what 
everyone did; we just happened to get on television for it.” 
Despite never watching the show, when 
Brittany realized “Jersey Shore” was in Flor -
ence, she was determined to meet the cast.
“I walked into a bar with a friend, and there they were,” she said. “I thought, ‘How cool would it be to talk to them?’ And I just walked up and introduced myself.” 
With MTV now selling “twinning” T-
shirts and Pauly D’s con-
clusion that “twinning is 
winning,” there’s buzz surrounding this new con-cept.
“No, twinning is not 
what the ‘Jersey Shore’ de-picted it as,” Brittany said. “Twinning is dressing the 
same, being on the same page, doing the 
same things together — nothing perverted. 
It’s just being.” Before they made their debut on na-
tional television, Brittany was studying in Gainesville while Erica was in Oliver-Pyatt Centers residential treatment center in Mi-ami juggling eating disorder recovery with 
UF Distance Learning. 
“Before Italy, I was unhappy with my-
self,” Erica said. “I was unsure and uncon-
fident.” 
Being able to travel, spend time with her 
sister and be on television proved to be a booster for Erica, who realizes she has poten-tial in life for more than an eating disorder. 
Followers of the show are buzzing over 
her declaration of virginity, but Erica doesn’t ALYSSA HOLCOMB

Rock the Universe, one of Florida’s most popular music 
festivals, is mixing elements both new and old to provide 
fans with another fun, spiritual experience.
By combining mainstream headliners, including Switch-
foot and Anberlin, with a new “fan zone” where concertgo-ers can actually meet some of the featured performers, the event at Universal Orlando Resort is expected to continue 
the tradition of good music and message. 
Matt Thiessen, lead singer of alternative band Relient K, 
is excited to be headlining 10 years after the band’s premiere 
appearance in the popular festival.
“I remember being really nervous the first time we played 
Rock the Universe,” Thiessen said. “They kept asking us back over the years, and that just kind of made it way more relaxing, just to kind of be able to come back and be a part of it and have more songs. We were getting better as a band. 
I guess the beauty of it is now that we still get asked back 
10 years later, and we’re going in it just really stoked to be a part of it, and I think that translates.”
The two-day event, taking place Sept. 9 and 10, has be-
come a meeting point of both popular artists and those on the rise who share a common interest.
“We work with a lot of the record labels. We try to moni-
tor who the next up-and-coming acts are gonna be,” said Jim 
Stout, director of talent booking and casting at Universal Or -
lando Resort. “We look at the billboard charts. We monitor 
the Christian charts. We see who the next cutting edge acts are. And based on that, we make our decisions on who we want to headline the events and who we want to showcase 
as the next big thing.”
The mainstream appeal mixed with the Christian music 
genre is a one-of-a-kind combination that attracts audiences 
of all backgrounds and tastes.
“We are very fortunate with Switchfoot, Anberlin and 
Relient K that they are Christian bands that [are] also main-stream genre, so there’s a huge crossover appeal. So our event is not just limited to Christian as a genre; it’s open to 
everyone,” Stout said. 
The event has a reputation of drawing crowds far and 
wide, and Gainesville’s audience is no exception.
No matter preference or perception, the goal of the con-
cert is to thrive both socially and spiritually.
“There’s an inspiration of some sort that comes through your soul,” Stout said. “It doesn’t matter whether you are 
religious or not, or what your beliefs are. There’s a sort of positive energy. I think that makes it different from a typical rock concert.” 
Individual, one-night passes start at $59.99 if bought the 
day of, but prices vary based on group rates and special va-cation packages available. Tickets can be purchased through Universal Orlando Resort’s website, universalorlando.com.

‘Twinning’ UF seniors Erica Taltos, left, and Brittany Taltos pose for a pic -
ture donning matching outfits before heading to midtown to celebrate 
Saturday night’s football victory against FAU.
The Taltos twins talk “haters,” 
have a reality show in the works
apologize for it.
 “I own it,” she said. “I’m waiting for the person 
I love.” 
As far as Brittany’s sexual escapades go, she de-
nied having sex with Mike “The Situation” Sorren-
tino. Brittany also confidently declared she is fine with being his second choice.
“If you tell me I’m the whole package, I’d be 
offended,” she said. “Who wants to be The Situa-tion’s whole package? Not me.” 
Brittany confirmed receiving a letter from her 
professor telling her to revoke her contract with 
MTV .
“I called my lawyer,” she said.
Professor Norman Lewis, who accompanied the 
90 students in Florence, refused to comment on the 
situation at hand.
“The bigger picture here is that the month-long 
study abroad trip that Dr. Mike Weigold designed 
and led was one of the most amazing educational experiences I’ve ever had and an academic high-
light for dozens of students,” he said. 
Lawyer-ing up proved a point for Brittany, as 
UF revoked its decision to punish anyone who de-
cided to participate in the MTV show. Following 
her sister’s lead, Erica signed the contract the next 
day.
“It was the best time of my entire life; I don’t 
regret it one bit,” Brittany said. 
Besides having a reality show in the works, 
“Twins B&E,” as their Facebook fan page is called, 
the two put school on the back burner for a few 
days as they flew out to New York City last week to 
film an episode of “The Bill Cunningham Show.”
“Now we’re making something of it,” Erica 
said. “We’re not going to end as the ‘whores’ who starred on ‘Jersey Shore.’”
And in response to the “haters”?  “They’re too worried about what other people 
are doing,” Erica said. “It was our Spring Break in Italy. We made it to class every day. We made A’s in our classes. We didn’t do anything illegal, and we 
shouldn’t be chastised for it.”  
“Your comments go over my head,” Brittany 
said. “You clearly have a bad mindset, and you’re 
never going to get through life.”jERSEY SHORE , from page 7

“Young, Broke and Beautiful: Broke-Ass Stuart’s Guide to Liv -
ing Cheaply” is a gold mine for money-saving tips.
AMY STUART 
Avenue Writer
“Broke-Ass” Stuart Schuffman 
is not afraid to call you out. He uses 
every curse word in the book. He of-
fends you for your bad spending hab-
its and bluntly calls you a dumbass for your idiotic purchases. But, while 
you might feel insecure about your 
latest buy or offended by his ridicule, his book, “Young, Broke and Beauti-
ful: Broke-Ass Stuart’s Guide to Living 
Cheaply,” is the Holy Grail for college students. 
Targeting all the ways people 
spend money, Schuffman unravels his knowledge from years of travel and 
experience in a neatly organized, 222-
page guidebook. From drinking and eating to dating and traveling, Schuff-
man posts all his secrets on how to save 
every goddamn dime you’re worth. 
You might know Schuffman from 
his earlier guidebooks based on saving 
money in New York and San Francis-co, or you may have seen him on the 
Independent Film Channel this sum-
mer in his new critically acclaimed TV 
show, “Young, Broke and Beautiful.” 
With aspirations to be a travel 
writer, Schuffman started out in San 
Francisco carrying around a backpack 
full of zines and a small do-it-yourself 
magazine and hit the streets to spread 
his knowledge. This was his first draft of frugal living on the streets of Cali-
fornia. “Getting out on the streets was my 
first step to getting known,” Schuff-
man said,“just me running around with my backpack full of zines.”
Traveling for 10 years, Schuffman 
has compiled hundreds of tips on how to save money in almost every situa-
tion. For Gainesville students, some of 
the top tips may be on drinking, eating and dating. 
After 20 hours of work and 15 
hours of class, it makes sense that you want to go out on the weekend to do 
some stupid, re-
gretful things. But 
your soon-to-be-paid rent is on your 
desk, and you’re 
living in 85-degree heat just to keep 
your electricity bill 
down, so fun opportunities seem to pass. Schuffman disagrees and tells you exactly how to get around paying 
more than you should for a few beers and a burrito. 
Tips include saving money on 
drinks at the bar, finding the right places to eat around your town, saving 
on entertainment and even ways to 
host a cheap date. There are health and 
beauty tips, advice on where to shop, 
websites for cheap textbooks and even 
dozens of suggestions if you’re search-
ing for a job.
The conclusion of the book includes 
a section written by professional finan-
cial coach Betsy Crouch on how to handle your finances, see if any former employers owe you money , learn how 
to spend on a budget and determine your financial priorities in life. 
“Betsy is great when it comes to 
managing your money,” Schuffman said. “I’m no good with money or in-
vesting. She really sums up the impor -
tant financial information that no one 
ever wants to confront.”
Along with tips for saving cash, this 
hysterical and truthful guide shows you how to live an A+ lifestyle. 
While the world seems to revolve 
around money , Schuffman proves there are ways to have an awesome time even if you are a “broke-ass” stu-
dent. 
“No matter what you do,” Schuff-
man said, “work your ass off and be nice to everybody because that stuff 
comes back around to you in the 
end.”
Schuffman is hoping to continue his 
TV show on IFC and has future plans 
to write short stories. He will be host-
ing an East Coast tour — sadly , not in 
Florida — where half the session will be Q-and-A and the other half a dance 
party. You can check out his website at 
brokeassstuart.com to see upcoming 
events, read money-saving columns or 
watch videos from his TV show. 
“Come out and see me! Follow me 
on Twitter and Facebook. Tell your 
friends about me,” Schuffman said. “I 
don’t care if it’s good or bad.” Book is Holy Grail to living cheaply
the sound of the Krayt Dragon cry 
that Obi-Wan Kenobi uses to scare away some Tusken Raiders from Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader now shouts the same infamous “Nooooo” from 
“Revenge of the Sith” as he tosses the 
Emperor down the shaft. Ewoks now have digital blinking eyes, puppet Yoda from “The Phantom Menace” has been replaced with a CGI one and Greedo, clear as day , shoots first. This may not mean much for the average 
Star Wars fan, but for the die-hards, it’s something to get riled up about.
Cheyne Delaney , a senior marketing student and Star Wars 
enthusiast, isn’t fond of the changes Lucas is making. 
“I just don’t see the reasoning behind it,” Delaney said. “I 
loved the films as a kid, as did a million others. I don’t think he should be changing things we already love.”
I can understand some of the changes. Adding the blinking 
eyes to the Ewoks will make them more believable and less like walking teddy bears. Replacing the puppet Yoda with a CGI one in “The Phantom Menace” will irk some purists, but pup-
pet Yoda was a bit out of place to begin with. Why the rest?
In an open letter to Lucas, International Business Times 
copy chief Shawn Moynihan wrote, “These aren’t effects shots 
that were added to help expand the films’ visual scope or help tell the story. They’re just tweaks, done for the sake of tweak-ing.”
Moynihan hit the nail on the head. Lucas isn’t changing his 
films because he thinks they’ll be better from it. He is doing so because he can and because he knows Star Wars fans will still 
line up to buy them.
If you’re upset with the changes, vote with your wallet. 
Don’t buy the Blu-ray release (available Sept. 16). Don’t give 
Lucas a reason to continue to “update” his movies. 10, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2011
 He Says…  She Says… Remember when you 
were kid and playing with 
toys was pretty much the best thing ever?  
Action figures, Barbies, 
Legos, whatever — toys 
were the jam, the catalysts 
that temporarily blew your mind as they transported you into another fantasy world a million times bet-ter than reality.  
Then you grew up. Luckily, we’ve now 
reached an age where the realm of pleasurably naugh-ty playthings enters our 
lives.  Sex toys are convivial 
indulgences that encourage us to reach our erotic sal-vations. My friends, there’s no need to be embarrassed. Let’s discuss.Honestly, I’ve never 
used any toys while 
messing around 
and have never felt the 
need to. But for some, the 
addition of playful para-
phernalia into the bedroom 
may spark some needed 
excitement into an other -
wise dull sex life.
My advice would be to 
consult your partner be-fore you even begin to get 
frisky. The last thing you 
want to do is surprise him or her with an unexpected visitor once the clothes start 
flying. Doing so may run 
the risk of being an instant mood-killer.
For couples, it is im-
portant to make sure your 
sweetheart is comfortable 
with adding toys to the mix. Make sure they don’t say yes just to make you 
happy. Any uncomfort-able feelings will definitely 
show come game time. Re-
member that introducing 
toys might make them feel inadequate, as if the toy 
was there to make up for 
their poor performance. So 
be patient, and respect any 
qualms they may have.
After asking around, 
a common concern 
among students 
was that a toy might 
turn into another 
entity during sex, almost like a third person. As silly as 
this sounds, partners 
have to realize that a sex toy is a helper, not a substitute. 
Pleasure should come from 
your significant other, not 
the toy. So before you try to 
spice things up, remember that toys should be used rarely and with limits. 
— JACOB ROMOSERHe Said, She Said: Toying around in the bedroom  
How would you feel if someone re-painted the “Mona 
Lisa” to have a big smile? Or added pants to Michel-angelo’s “David”? You’d be pissed because, hey , those 
are works of art and should be left alone.
Shouldn’t we have the same impulsive desire to preserve 
films as they were originally created? In 1988, there was a movement through Congress asserting the need to federally protect films from being altered.  George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars series, spoke directly to Congress saying, “People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians.” 
It’s funny how things work. Fans are up in arms against Lucas for doing exactly what he 
was fighting against. Lucas has taken a paintbrush to his mas-
terpiece with a slew of  “improvements” to the series. 
For the second time since its theatrical release, he’s changed Changes in Star Wars Blu-ray upsetting to fans

Columnistn the Reeln the Reel
While many of you were filling 
your gullets at the tailgates this weekend, my boyfriend and I 
decided to take a field trip south on 13th Street to X-Mart, Gainesville’s finest 24/7 
adult supercenter. The mission? To figure 
out what kinds of sex toys are readily avail-able in Gator City .  
Now, I freely admit that I am probably 
older than most of you readers — 28 — and 
will also come forward to say that I have visited a fair share of sex shops across the globe. That being said, even I get flustered when I’m in a 
dominion of smut. Perhaps the im-
mediate confrontation with taboo, exaggerated artificial anatomy and observations of other couples (oh, 
THAT’S what you two are into, eh?) elicit coyness. Basically , the last thing I want to do when I’m in a sex shop is have sex.
Sensing my bashfulness, my boyfriend 
modestly began to make light of the atmo-
sphere as we walked the store’s perimeter. 
We contrasted the pros and cons of various dildos, questioned the inclinations shop-pers may have toward one butt plug ver -
sus another and applauded the cleverness of some toy designs (The Fleshlight for men is pretty remarkable). But feeling like middle-schoolers who finally found their 
parents’ porn stash, he and I left the store 
amused yet empty-handed.
I mention this story because it is im-
portant to realize that shopping for sex toys isn’t easy; however, I do believe ev-eryone can find something that captures their sexual attention if the timing is right. Determined to overcome my reluctance, I returned to the store the next day alone. It 
was then that I spoke to Chrisy , the assured 
sales associate who filled me in on some best-sellers. Here are three of her recom-mendations, appropriate for people of any sexual orientation.
Neon Bullet, $15-$25:  Small, multi-
speed vibrator with remote control. When it comes to this discreet toy, size doesn’t matter.  
Rabbit, $30-$120: “Sex and the City” 
made the Rabbit famous for a reason. Ana-tomically correct vibrators coated in a pli-able material and equipped with “ears” for extra stimulation.
Lelo, $75-$200: The Porsche of sex toys. 
Seamless design. A motor that practically purrs. Sleek, tasteful construction.

Single-game tickets for the UAB game this 
Saturday remain on sale. Tickets will be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis at multiple locations. Hall of Fame
The university announced Wednesday that eight former Gators will be inducted into the UF Athletic Hall of Fame. This year’s inductees are highlighted by Udonis Haslem, Abby Wambach and Alex Brown.

Gators defensive coordina-
tor Dan Quinn was pleased with  
his unit’s overall performance in 
the season opener last weekend, 
when Florida held FAU to 137 to-tal yards. 
But Quinn added that the de-
fensive line needs to create more havoc on pass plays. He doesn’t measure the team’s pass rush ex-clusively on sacks (Florida had two Saturday); instead he looks 
at pressures, hits on the quar -
terback and passes tipped at the 
line.
“We had a couple of missed 
opportunities for some big plays on the QB,” Quinn said.
He also pointed out that the 
Gators allowed the opposing quarterback to escape the pocket 
and scramble a couple of times 
last Saturday, implying the pass rush was uneven. 
“That’s part of pass rush, too,” 
he said. 
“One rusher got too high and 
another one was too low and it created an escape lane.”
Affecting the quarterback will 
be more important this week 
than it was in the season opener, 
as UAB’s Bryan Ellis threw for 2,940 yards in nine starts last sea-son. FAU signal caller Graham Wilbert had thrown five career 
passes prior to Saturday’s loss.Expansion talk: With the 
Southeastern Conference presi-
dents voting unanimously to ac-cept Texas A&M as a new mem-
ber of the SEC on Tuesday night, 
plenty of coaches were asked their opinions on the potential move during the football tele-
conference Wednesday morning.
“Whatever (UF President Ber -
nie) Machen and our administra-
tion decide, I’ll support,” coach Will Muschamp said. “A&M’s 
got a great tradition and it’s an 
outstanding program. I really think we’re headed to the 16-team leagues eventually. I think 
there will be four of them at some 
point.”
Big 12 commissioner Dan Bee-
be sent a letter to SEC commis-sioner Mike Slive on Friday stat-ing the Big 12’s board of directors would not pursue litigation if the 
SEC accepted Texas A&M. 
After voting to accept A&M, 
the SEC presidents were in-
formed that one university (pre-
sumably Baylor) was protesting 
the move, Machen said in a state-ment.
Late Wednesday, ESPN.com 
reported that in fact presidents 
from every Big 12 school except for Oklahoma would refuse to 
waive their rights to litigation, meaning Texas A&M’s path to 
the SEC could be less smooth 
than originally anticipated.
Taylor impressing: While he 
didn’t make an impact until the second half Saturday, middle 
linebacker Michael Taylor drew 
rave reviews from starter Jon Bostic. Taylor contributed one as-sist and two solo tackles against 
the Owls, including one of the 
hardest hits of the evening.On a 1st-and-10 in the fourth 
quarter, Taylor exploded past the line and brought down run-
ning back Damian Fortner two 
yards deep in the backfield.
“He attacks real well,” Bostic 
said. “When he sees it, he’s just going to go; he’s going to pull the 
trigger.”
Injuries: Tight end A.C. Leon-
ard (rehabbing from torn menis-
cus in knee) is the only Gator out 
for Saturday’s game, Muschamp 
said Wednesday.  The coach said earlier in the 
week that wide receiver Omarius Hines (hamstring) is probable 
while cornerback Jeremy Brown 
(knee) and receiver Robert Clark (hamstring) are questionable.  
Receiver Deonte Thompson, 
who exited Saturday’s game af-
ter taking a hit to the back of the 
head, has practiced this week, receiver Frankie Hammond said Wednesday.

Gators defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said the defensive line missed some opportunites for sacks 
against FAU. Quinn highlighted the pass rush as an area that needs to improve this Saturday. 
END OF GREGULATION
Am I crazy to think UAB might actu-
ally have a shot Saturday?
Even when Florida opened last 
season with a historically anemic perfor -
mance against a patsy from the Mid-Amer -
ican Conference, it still beat Miami (Ohio) by 22. Coincidentally, that’s the margin by which Florida is favored against UAB, a Conference USA team that went 4-8 last 
year. 
But here are the 10 biggest reasons I 
think Florida should be on upset alert:
1. UAB is a lot better than it seems.  
This team lost four games by one score or less in 2010 and is returning 16 starters. 
2. Blazers head coach Neil Callaway.  
He’s in his fifth year on the job, and he needs to win now, or he’s likely gone. 3. UAB is unveiling a new defen-
sive scheme with Tommy West calling the shots. Since Saturday marks UAB’s 
opener, a lot of what he’s going to do is a mystery. Charlie Weis said he’s using both 
2010 UAB film and 2009 Memphis film — 
West’s last job — to prepare. That’s a lot for UF to digest. 
4. UAB will test Florida’s weakness. 
The Blazers will air it out in a pass-happy spread offense, one that figures to be ef-
fective with returning starter Bryan Ellis at 
quarterback. Without question, Florida’s most shaky, or at least most unproven, po-
sition group is the secondary. With Jeremy 
Brown still “probable-to-questionable,” the Gators could be forced to lean heavily 
on four players who never started before this season and one 
Moses Jenkins. Not 
a great scenario. 
5. No heat off 
the edge. One area 
Muschamp tagged 
as a weakness from Saturday was the outside pass rush. 
UF can expect UAB’s offensive line to set up with wide splits, making that task even 
more difficult. 
6. Florida could suffer a letdown. The 
Gators have been running the two-scrubs-then-Tennessee open to the season for a 
while now, and history shows they’ve been equally dominant against both softies. But 
this is a new, young group that was under enormous pressure to look good in Week 
1 following last year’s struggles. Now that 
this hurdle has been cleared, it wouldn’t 
be a stretch if they had their sights set on Tennessee rather than UAB. 
7. UF’s defensive tackles could never 
match Saturday’s effort. Florida’s big men in the middle looked like world-beaters last weekend. Dominique Easley, Jaye Howard 
and the rest of the gang lived in the back-
field, and there was nothing FAU could do 
about it. UAB isn’t that bad. The Blazers 
return four of five offensive line starters and a Rimington Trophy watch list center 
in Darion Smith. If they can convert just 
one or two first downs — something FAU Ten reasons why UAB can pull off the upset in The SwampFlorida seeking better 
pass rush on Saturday

With five seniors and three ju-
niors on the roster, the natural as-
sumption would be that the No. 7 Gators are a top-heavy , veteran squad.
While Florida’s experienced 
players certainly do their part, the underclassmen have been just as im-portant to UF’s 6-1 start.
Less-experienced Gators like 
redshirt freshman Taylor Unroe and sophomores Chloe Mann and Chanel Brown have all started matches this season.
Mann has been playing excep-
tionally well of late, racking up 15 of her 19 kills during last weekend’s Campus USA Credit Union Invite.
“It’s really exciting (to get more 
playing time),” Mann said. 
“We all work hard and for it 
come through in matches is really nice to see.”
Her best performance came in 
her first career start, a 3-0 sweep of Clemson on Saturday, when she re-corded nine kills and an .818 hitting percentage.
“She is the best jumper on the 
team,” Florida coach Mary Wise said Saturday . “She looked like an experienced player out there and 
she never looked lost.”
Mann’s efforts earned her a start-
ing slot in Monday’s 3-2 loss to No. 
17 Iowa State, a match that saw five underclassmen log significant play-ing time.
One player in particular who 
underwent a baptism by fire was freshman defensive specialist Madi-son Monserez, who appeared in the second, fourth and fifth sets against the Cyclones.
“It’s so hard to go in a situation 
like that, and I think [the underclass-men] did such an awesome job of being composed,” junior Tangerine Wiggs said. “They never made us nervous and we were confident in them.”
Unroe receives honor:  Unroe, 
the Gators’ redshirt freshman libero, 
was named 
the South-
e a s t e r n Conference 
Freshman of the Week on Tuesday for her play against No. 24 Florida State, as well as her efforts against Florida Atlantic, Jacksonville, and Clemson in last weekend’s tourna-ment.
In those four matches Unroe 
totaled nine assists and 44 digs en route to four consecutive three-set victories.
Overall, Unroe leads Florida 
with 80 digs, averaging 3.48 per set, and ranks third on the team with 17 assists.
After redshirting last season be-
cause of a broken bone in her ankle, Unroe is making up for lost time, as she is one of only four Gators to play in all 23 sets this season.
UF to play in California: The 
Gators will play their third and fourth ranked opponents of the sea-
son in this weekend’s NIKE Big Four 
Classic in Palo Alto, Calif.“It won’t get any easier now go-
ing on the road,” Wise said. “It will feel very different in terms of that road mentality . … We could have used a little road mentality (Mon-day). Iowa State came in with it.”
Florida will play No. 10 Texas Friday and then face off on Saturday against either No. 2 Penn State or the tournament host, No. 3 Stanford.
“Games like this are what make 
us better — games where we’re test-ed and we see where we need to get better as a team,” Wiggs said.16, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2011
Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
Florida defensive specialist Taylor Unroe (55) was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of the 
Week on Tuesday after recording nine assists in 44 digs in four Gators wins last week. 
couldn’t do until almost halftime — UF’s 
defensive tackles might start to breathe a 
bit heavier, and Dominique Easley’s leg-
endary get-off might not be so legendary. 
8. No Floyd, big problem. With Sharrif 
Floyd still ineligible for the time being, the Gators might lack the depth necessary to 
keep their big guys fresh, especially if both 
teams stick with the hurry-up. 
9. The Swamp won’t have its familiar 
sting. Florida drew only 88,708 fans for its season opener, breaking a streak of 137 consecutive sellouts dating to 1989. Con-
sidering that was opening day, the crowd for UAB should be significantly smaller. 
And even if it isn’t, the Blazers won’t 
care. In front of 95,183 fans at Tennes-
see last season, UAB was any one of five 
missed field goals in regulation away from 
a win, instead falling 32-29 in double over -
time.
10. UAB has a new kicker. There’s an extremely high likelihood 
I’m way off base on this. If Florida rolls by 30, I won’t be shocked in the least, and I’ll gladly eat a large helping of crow. But, if 
it works out that way, it’ll be because UF 
proved something, not because UAB is just another pushover.
