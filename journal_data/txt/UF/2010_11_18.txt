A fire at the Sigma Chi fraternity 
house, 8 Fraternity Row, on Wednes-
day morning will lead to the eviction of one house resident and a mandatory fire safety educational session from the Gainesville Police Department. 
 A fraternity member had fallen asleep 
with the coal in his hookah still burning. The hookah had tipped over, lighting the mattress on fire.  Hookahs are not al-lowed inside the house. 
The Gainesville Fire Rescue Depart-
ment arrived minutes later and venti-lated the room, said JoAnne Rice, district chief of the department.
No one will be living in that room 
anymore, and the membership status of the brother will be determined next week at an internal hearing.

She’s the girl you see on 
the bus every morning, hunched over a book, 
scribbling answers to math prob-lems, listening to music with big 
headphones. 
As the music plays, she stays 
still, always looking down. 
She’s the one sitting next to 
you in class, or the one across the 
table at lunch. At night, she’s one of many girls dancing away to the rhythm of Spanish music at the cramped dance clubs.
The girl, a 19-year-old college 
student whose identity is being withheld to protect her legally, has spent more than half of her life living in this country undoc-umented, moving through life carefully and quietly. In the eyes of the United States government, she doesn’t even exist.
Now, she seeks a few pieces 
of paper that will legitimize her being here. When she fills out a job application, she doesn’t want to stop at the box labeled Social Security. Above all, she wants a chance.
Her story is one of about 65,000 
that arise each year. According to 
the National Immigration Law 
Center, this many undocumented youths — students who came to the country before their 16th birthdays — graduate from high school each year in the U.S.
They are the children of illegal 
immigrants. 
They are kids who can’t get 
loans to go to college and can’t get legal jobs to support them-selves once they leave home.
And they don’t have a legal 
way to earn citizenship.
�  �  �
The Development, Relief and 
Education for Alien Minors Act, or DREAM Act, could become law before the end of the year, as Congress convenes for the post-election session this week.
Or, it could die. The act provides a path for children of illegal immigrants to earn citizenship if they go to col-lege or serve in the military.
Local DREAM Act supporter 
Victoria Mena led a candlelight 
vigil Sunday night on the Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza, where about 30 supporters pledged their support on the eve of Congress’ reconvening.
Standing in a circle, candles 
lit, they used their cell phones to call the office of Sen. George Le-Mieux, the Republican senator 
from Florida.
“I’ve been waiting all my life 
to make this call,” one supporter 
said.
“Please, sir, support the 
DREAM Act,” another supporter said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry 
Reid won his re-election with the 
strong backing of Hispanic vot-ers in Nevada two weeks ago. Before the shift of power comes, 
he promised to introduce the bill during his final session as major -
ity leader. The act had been at-tached to a military spending bill earlier in the year when it stalled after it met a Republican-led fili-buster in September.
Mena said she knows this is 
the last opportunity for the Dem-ocratic majority to give the bill life, and that after this, it could be a long time before another real chance comes again.
“There’s a sense of urgency,” 
she said.
�  �  �
More than anything, the girl 
had been excited to fly. 
“I was fascinated with planes,” 
she said, thinking back to the 2000 trip that brought her to this country.
She knew her family had come 
to make a new home. Her friends in Argentina had thrown her three 
surprise going-away parties. 
They had made her a scrapbook packed with as many memories as 8-year-olds can have.
Her father, Mariano, her 
younger brother, Gian, and her mother, Veronica, had packed what they could of their lives and brought it to America.
Veronica kept telling her son 
and daughter to tell anyone who asked that they were coming for vacation.
“Just tell them that you’re 
coming here for Disney World,” she told them.
Standing in front of the immi-
gration officer, Veronica spoke in 
quivering English.
“Disney. Disney. Disney,” she 
said, smiling and nodding.
The girl remembers hearing fear in her mother’s voice. She 
wouldn’t completely understand this until later.
“I had no idea, but I thought 
something was odd,” she said. 
“I was young and naive, but I 
wasn’t stupid.”
They passed through the gate 
as tourists with visas that were to expire in a few months.
Their vacation would last 10 
years.
�  �  �
In 2005, in preparation to ap-
ply for citizenship and get papers for his children, Mariano mar -
ried another woman. There was a wedding cake, a party and a cer -
tificate. 
He had hired her, a natural-
ized Cuban woman and U.S. citi-
zen, to be his wife only on credit 
card statements, on an apartment lease agreement and in family photo albums.
For the wedding, Veronica 
served as the photographer. 
She would often photograph 
the “family” during weekend out-ings — trips to the Dolphin Mall, 
the park or the beach. The beach 
trips, though, always seemed to fall on the grayest days.
The relics of precious memo-
ries were nothing more than evi-dence to convince immigration officials the marriage was legiti-mate.
The girl remembers the days 
of fake parties to decorate Christ-mas trees, insincere smiles and forced hugs, laughing now at the acting job.
“The pictures were so bad,” 
she says. “You could see it.”
She looks down, smile fading.“It was all so illegitimate, but it 
was all for me and my brother.”
When Mariano and the wom-
an married, they had notified the government to begin the process of getting papers. 
They needed to forge a docu-
mented life together, and they needed their day at the immigra-tion office to prove it was real.
Their day came three years 
later in 2008.
The girl was 17.

Students march in protest against block tuition by marching from Turlington Plaza to the 
front steps of Tigert Hall on Wednesday afternoon. 
ON CAMPUS
� THEY GAVE A PETITION TO A UF 
OFFICIAL FOR BERNIE MACHEN.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
About 70 students chanted and marched 
with signs from Turlington Plaza to Tigert 
Hall on Wednesday to protest the adminis-
tration’s block tuition proposals. 
Block tuition, which would charge stu-
dents a flat fee equivalent to the cost of 15 credit hours, is currently being discussed to 
be implemented as early as fall 2011, said 
UF Provost Joe Glover. 
The students stood in front of Tigert 
Hall while members of Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society addressed the crowd. 
“They’ve got us by our wallets, and they 
know they can do these kinds of things to 
us,” said Jose Soto, a member of the group.
The protesters handed a petition 
with 750 signatures to Mary Carodine, assistant vice president of student af-fairs, who promised to deliver the peti-tions to UF President Bernie Machen.  Following the rally, three of the protesters, Dave Schneider, Jose Soto and Diana More-
no, were able to meet with Glover. 
Schneider said the meeting went well 
and the protesters achieved their aim of 
opening a dialogue between the students 
and administration on the issue.
However, Schneider was disappointed 
with the administration’s stance.
 “It really became clear throughout the 
entire meeting with him how different the administration’s interests and the students’ 
interests are on the issue of block tuition,” he said.
The Board of Trustees will vote on block 
tuition Dec. 9. Schneider, who organized Wednesday’s protest, plans to organize an-other rally that day.Students march with tuition petition for Machen

After spending 16 years in a re-
search facility, a descendant of Tri-
ple Crown winner Secretariat was 
rescued by an Alachua couple and now resides on a farm for retired horses. 
Our Lady Slew, a 19-year-old 
thoroughbred mare, is the grand-daughter of the famous horse who was portrayed in a recent  movie. Secretariat won the Triple Crown in 
1973, taking first place in the Ken-
tucky Derby, the Belmont Stakes and the Preakness Stakes. 
Peter and Mary Gregory run the 
Retirement Home for Horses Inc. at Mill Creek Farm in Alachua. They got Our Lady Slew and two other mares in May after a research facil-ity had to get rid of 30 horses due to 
financial problems. 
Prior to being rescued, she spent 
16 years at the research facility un-dergoing experimentation and be-ing run on a treadmill, sometimes 
up to 50 miles per day. She was also bred to pay the costs for her experi-mentation.
The Gregory cou-
ple said they agreed not to name the facil-ity.  
Our Lady Slew also suffered 
health problems in October. 
“Our vet felt it was neurologi-
cal,” Peter Gregory said. “She has recovered, but no doubt it will lin-
ger in the background before resur -
facing. That’s my opinion.”
Our Lady Slew now shares a 10-
acre pasture with Our Lady Soul 
and Rose, the other two mares that 
came with her, and Felix, a retired 
mounted police duty horse from 
the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s 
Office. 
Other horses rescued are retired 
from circuses, police units, mili-tary units and equine education 
programs. Some are rescued from 
being abused or neglected. They 
normally only accept horses over the age of 20. Gregory estimates 
that each horse costs about $2,000 a year including food, cover and vet-erinarian costs.
The Gregorys believe that older 
horses deserve a home, proper care 
and an honorable death. While 
younger horses are more likely to 
be adopted, senior horses are some-times abandoned after they are thought to be useless. 
“We have two rules here,” Pe-
ter Gregory said. “The first rule is the horses will never be ridden or worked again. And the second is they stay forever.”

If you’ve ever used a GPS, 
you’ve used GIS.
Geographic Information Sys-
tems, or GIS — tools used to create 
maps like the ones in GPS units 
—  stole the spotlight Wednesday 
for National GIS Day. 
To celebrate the day, George A. 
Smathers  Library hosted a group 
of speakers to educate students 
about the technology.The event attracted about 150 
people.
According to Carol McAuliffe, 
UF’s map librarian, GIS is a way of mapping areas based on lay-
ers. 
A geographer starts with a flat 
plane and then adds different 
“levels” for different features on top of it. 
For example, a map may have 
one layer indicating major roads and another featuring coordi-nates for buildings, according to McAuliffe.
“It really functions behind the 
scenes,” she said. “It’s something a lot of people use every day, but very few really know about it.”
GIS powers many technolo-
gies students use on a daily basis, McAuliffe said. 
Gainesville’s 
Regional Transit System uses the system to plan its local bus routes. 
Maps shown 
on Google maps and other map-
ping websites are determined 
and drawn using GIS. 
The technology is even used in GPS units to point drivers toward 
the nearest rest stop or fast food drive-through.
A part of Geography Aware-
ness Week featured speakers who 
use GIS in their professions as a 
way of showing how versatile the 
technology is. 
For example, the system has 
been used to study childhood obesity to determine where the 
disease is most prevalent.
“I don’t think it gets the ac-
colades it deserves,” McAuliffe 
said.
 “I hope people walk away 
from today understanding just how important this technology is.”
“GIS is used extensively in 
every industry,” said Curt David-son, a geography junior. “Some-one like Pizza Hut can use it to 
map out the most ideal places to 
open up a new store.”
As a geography student, Da-
vidson, 27, had worked with GIS previously, but he said he hopes 
GIS Day helps other students un-
derstand the technology.
“At first glance it can be pretty 
intimidating,” he said of the ad-
vanced technology. “But it helps 
people in so many ways.”

The wait is over. Accio your 
popcorn and tickets; “Harry Potter 
and the Deathly Hollows: Part 1” is 
here. 
Students have been waiting for 
the Friday release and have pre-
pared for opening day by buying 
their tickets in advance.
Harry Potter fans will invade 
Regal Gainesville Cinema 14, 3101 SW 35th Blvd., for the first showing 
at 12:01 a.m.  
Debbie Lee, a 19-year-old UF 
marketing sophomore, said she 
bought her tickets about a month ago. She said she is beyond excited to see the movie. 
Audra Lewis, a 21-year-old UF 
agricultural communication and leadership development senior, said she plans to arrive at the the-
ater at about 11 p.m. to make sure 
she has the best seats possible.  
Lee plans to arrive an hour and 
a half early. 
The corporate office of Regal 
Cinema was unable to provide specific local information about in-creased staff and preparation.
According to fandango.com, all 
14 of the midnight showings have been sold out. Tickets for the show-ing at 3:15 a.m. are still being sold.
Harry Potter fanatics will dress 
in themed attire from the movie to 
show their excitement for the new 
installment.
“I’ve always wanted to dress 
up,” Lewis said. “Since this is the 
last book, it may 
be the perfect oc-
casion.”
She plans to dress up as Ginny 
Weasley, sister of Ron Weasley from the series.
Students have been looking for -
ward to the movie since July 17, 2009, when “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,” the previous installment in the film series, was released.
Sarah Faulkner, a 20-year-old UF 
advertising junior, said she is so ex-
cited for the movie and that she no 
longer has to have a countdown.
“I love the books and movies 
and would drop anything to watch them,” Faulkner said. “If I could 
live at Hogwarts, I would.”
“I’m pretty excited,” Lewis said. 
“I’ve read every book and seen ev-
ery single movie on the midnight 
they have been released.”
Sara Kaner, a 19-year-old UF 
public relations and psychology 
junior, said she and her roommates 
have been getting into the Harry Potter mood by watching all of the 
movies before the premiere.
Lewis said she expects the mov-
ie to be entertaining as usual, but 
she knows the movie will leave out 
some details from the book. 
“The movies have gotten better 
and better with each new release, so 
I’m hoping that this is no different,” 
Kaner said.
She said she wishes she could 
be seeing both parts to the last in-stallment, but she’s glad that she’ll 
finally be seeing the first part of the 
last movie.
As of now, “Harry Potter and 
the Deathly Hollows: Part 2,” the fi-
nal movie in the series, has a release 
date of July 15, 2011.4, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2010

So far, 14 of the midnight showings have sold outBy MIGUEL A. CHATELOIN

Ricky Klopfenstein was frantic when 
he didn’t see Molly’s patchy-haired “rat 
tail” wagging under the crawl space of his 
house.
It was the last possible place his dog 
could be.
In minutes, six cars filled with friends 
were searching his neighborhood for the black cocker spaniel.
That was on Friday —  almost a week 
later, Molly is still missing. 
As long as people have owned pets, 
they’ve had to search for their best friends 
when they were lost.
Klopfenstein hung 40 fliers in hopes of 
capturing the attention of the fans who would be going to the South Carolina 
game the next day.
But he also took his search for Molly 
into the 21st century.
Klopfenstein made a Web page, www.
richardklopfenstein.com/lostblackdog, dedicated to finding her, and he has been 
encouraging his friends to share the link on their Facebook news feeds.
“There’s a much faster way to reach 
people than just a sign on the side of the road,” Klopfenstein said.
Being a design-savvy journalism gradu-
ate and known by his friends as a “multi-
media wiz,” Klopfenstein sais he has used 
every trick in the book to get his message out.
In large font, “LOST BLACK DOG” is 
displayed at the top of the page, followed by photos of Molly, a video of her playing 
at the Reitz Union  Amphitheater and a Google map image with a marker indicat-
ing the last place she was seen —  the cor -
ner of University Avenue and 25th Street.
He pleads on the page for the commu-
nity to help “a fellow Gator.” 
“It’s the most devastating thing that can 
happen to him,” said his roommate, Katie LeBlanc. “Molly is like a family member to 
Ricky. She meant the world to him.”
So far, 152 people shared Klopfenstein’s 
page on Facebook, and he’s hoping it be-comes viral.
Klopfenstein, who turned 24 on 
Wednesday, would normally be annoyed 
by the scratching sound Molly makes from 
outside his back door at 2 a.m., but now he 
says it would be the best birthday present 
he could ever get.
“We’re getting to a week where she 
hasn’t had a dedicated source of food or water, and she’s a scrapper —  she eats 
garbage, but I don’t know how [she] fares 
in the wild,” he said. “It’s going to be dif-
ficult when it comes time to go home for 
Thanksgiving. There goes another six 
days.”
He asks anyone who sees Molly to hold 
onto her and call him at 407-765-8891 or 
send him an e-mail at yogo54@gmail.com.

She remembers it clearly: It 
was mid-November, sunny and 
“warm as hell — like always.” 
She had convinced herself she 
didn’t feel well, and her mother let her stay home from school.
Sitting in the living room, fin-
ishing her homework, she heard voices outside the front door.“Que se le va ser?” she heard 
her father tell his sister, who had driven him to his meeting with immigration officials.
It was a comment the girl knew 
he made when things didn’t go as planned: “What can you do?”
As she got up to walk to the 
door, her father came inside, wearing a button-down shirt, 
light-blue slacks and his ever-
present cell phone holster.
They stared at each other for 
only seconds before it was clear what had happened. They sat down together, and 
he could no longer hold it in.
“What else does this f---ing 
country want me do to? I tried everything. I tried so hard.”
His head sunk into his daugh-
ter’s shoulder. Both of them wept. Her shirt was drenched in his tears. It was the first time she had ever seen him cry.
“Why am I so useless?” he 
cried out. 
“No,” she told him. “You’re 
not useless. You are the strongest man in the world.”    
Weeks after Mariano and his 
family lost their chance at citizen-ship, they received a letter telling them they had 30 days to get out.
Keeping a low profile, the fam-
ily moved into a new house and stayed for another two years.
It was enough time for his 
daughter to finish growing up where she had come of age, grad-uate high school and make her decision.
She could either stay and go 
to school or go back to Argentina with her family.
Her family was leaving for 
good, and she had a choice. 
“If you stay,” Mariano told her, 
”let it be for a reason.”
Three months ago, they said 
their goodbyes, just days before her first day of classes.
She had chosen to stay, go to 
school, get an education and hope the government would give her the opportunity to work herself toward becoming an American.

“I want to work,” she says. “I 
want to pay taxes. Please, let me pay taxes.”
Opponents of the DREAM 
Act call it an exercise in amnesty, a free pass for people who have violated the law.
Supporters find it hard to be-
lieve many members of Congress are willing to reject a measure that would increase tax revenue and military recruitment.
She says she understands both 
sides, and she thinks it should take work to become a citizen —  learning English, getting an edu-cation and even assimilating the culture.
After finding out about the 
DREAM Act, she became in-volved with the movement in support of the bill. Like many of those like her, she calls herself a DREAMer. 
She is still nervous and unsure 
of the chances the bill has of pass-ing.
“I don’t know,” she says. “I 
just don’t know.”
She insists that she is lucky 
and that her story is not as bad as others.
“I know people think this is a 
pity story,” she said. “I don’t want people to feel sorry for me.”
Her wish is to not have to live 
with fear and uncertainty. 
More than anything, she wants 
to just be that girl on the bus.
She spends almost 90 minutes 
every day busing to and from school, time she spends reading and doing math homework.
An aspiring writer, she some-
times scribbles in the most recent of her 18 journals. 
Sometimes she’ll crack open a 
book from her shelf, like works by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isa-bel Allende and H.G. Wells.
A lot of the time, she’ll listen 
to some of her favorite music — everything from Argentine singer Gustavo Cerati to The Rolling 
Stones to Iggy Pop and the Stoog-
es.
When she wants to hear the 
music, she pulls out her iPod and slips her big headphones over her ears.
Then is when she fades into 
the crowds of busy students who bustle through the doors, each 
with their own headphones play-
ing a different tune.
Her next stop, she hopes, is a 
sense of normal.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 5

Today, students will arrive at the UF Hillel 
for dinner. But if all goes according to plan, 
most will leave with nearly empty stomachs.
One year after its first Hunger Banquet, 
the UF chapter of the international nonprofit 
group One will host A Taste of Poverty to 
recreate the global issue on a smaller scale at 6 p.m. today.
When students arrive, they will receive 
cards with the name of the country they rep-
resent. Members of the low-income countries 
will sit on the floor while everyone else will eat at tables. 
Students who represent high-income 
countries will have food served to them,  but others who represent less-wealthy countries will have to  serve themselves the food. 
About 15 percent of those who attend will 
receive a meal of pasta, salad and a bread-
stick; 35 percent will receive a middle-class 
meal of juice, rice and beans; and 50 percent will receive a low-class meal of a cup of rice only. 
“A lot of people are going to come away 
hungry, but that’s the point,” said Erica Ngoenha, UF chapter treasurer. “You can go back to your dorm or drive to McDonald’s and eat. But for a lot of people, that would be it for them.”
Domonique Worship, UF chapter presi-
dent, said while most students will return home in a week to a great Thanksgiving din-
ner, that’s not possible for everyone.
“This is a rare opportunity to get a first-
hand look at what it’s like to live with limited 
resources,” Worship said.
“I hope students can empathize a little 
more and be excited to help with extreme global poverty.”
Ngoenha said she believes that if students 
can feel what it’s like to be poor for just a short amount of time, they might be more inclined to help members of the developing 
world.
“We want to drive home the fact that 
we’re not only concerned about global pov-
erty, but poverty in our own community, too,” she said.Event to showcase hunger

Mochi Frozen Yogurt is offering a 
promotion to satisfy your taste buds 
and your conscience. 
If customers bring in a can of food 
to the frozen yogurt store, they will re-ceive a dollar off their purchase. 
The food drive started Nov. 1 and 
runs until Wednesday — just in time 
for Thanksgiving.
All cans collected in the food drive 
will be donated to Gainesville’s St. 
Francis House, a homeless shelter and soup kitchen, said Mochi employee 
Julie Fisher, 19.
“It’s a real win-win situation,” she 
said. “You’re donating to a great cause, 
and you get a deal on your fro-yo.”
Paul Cheng, Mochi district man-
ager, said the food drive is one of several community service events the store supports. Last month, it col-lected donations to fund breast cancer research.
“We try to give back to the com-
munity as much as we can,” he said. “Mochi was founded right here in 
Gainesville, so we do whatever we 
can to help the community that sup-ported us.”
This is the second year the store is 
hosting the food drive, he said. 
Last Thanksgiving, Mochi only had 
one Gainesville location, on Archer Road. Since then, it has opened two new stores, one on University Avenue 
and another downtown. 
“We think we’ll have more peo-
ple donate this year,” 
Cheng said. “With more locations, we should get more cans.”
Last year, the store collected about 
40 cans. He was unsure how many do-nations the chain has collected so far 
this year.
Jackie Keung, a sociology senior, 
said the incentive of frozen yogurt 
would particularly encourage stu-dents to participate in a food drive.
“Honestly, most college kids 
wouldn’t donate to a typical canned food drive,” Keung, 21, said. “But we love free food, so discounted Mochi 
should make us a little more gener -
ous.”Mochi holds food drive

Today’s question: Do you support 
the DREAM act?Wednesday’s question: Do you care if your friends think the per -
son you’re dating is attractive?
113 TOTAL VOTES46% YES54% NOUF’s meatless Mondays are ridiculous
“Mmm, tofu.” 
That will soon be a more common 
phrase thanks to Meatless Monday and 
several other well-intentioned organizations. From now 
on there will be more vegan options in UF’s feeding troughs. 
Of course, we can only hope that soon UF will cease to 
see any point in keeping meat on the menu on Mondays.
I mean, sure, vegan food sucks, but there’s countless 
benefits to counterbalance this fact, right? 
First, meat is unhealthy. It’s full of fat and other ani-
mal byproducts and bacteria. No chance of mad cow 
without the cow, right? Sure, salmonella can be spread 
through peanut butter, but it’s meat that is the real prob-lem, right? And, sure, you can easily purchase super-lean cuts of both pork and beef, but that would require per -
sonal responsibility and discernment. And sure, we get vitamin B-12 almost exclusively through meat, and, more specifically, the bacteria in meat, but let’s cling to that easy view of all bacteria being harmful. 
Second, meat is unnecessary. What do we need meat 
for, anyway? Yes, it contains B-12, which, unless we take multivitamins or eat feces, we won’t get without meat, but what’s one essential vitamin? And yes, meat has com-plete proteins that contain all the essential amino acids 
all in one place, but hey, it’s probably more efficient to 
spend time, money and effort getting together all the es-sential amino acids piecemeal. Yeah, I’m almost positive it makes sense to figure out exactly what plants contain — which of the twenty essential amino acids — and make 
sure that you eat enough of them on a regular enough 
basis to ensure you won’t be malnourished. 
Third, meat is inefficient. Surely the huge carbon meatprint I hear about is avoidable. It makes sense that, if cows eat corn to produce the meat we take from 
them, we can just cut the middle-
man and eat the corn ourselves. Never mind the fact that 
a huge portion of their diet is grass. Maybe grass is the next cilantro. Or we could just take the farmland that’s 
currently being used for livestock and grow corn on it, 
right? This is a perfect solution, disregarding the im-mense amount of development and unnatural measures it would take to convert current livestock land to crop land, rendering the trade-off basically pointless. 
For all these reasons and others, it’s more than appar -
ent that Meatless Monday has the right idea. My ques-tion is, why aren’t we going to fully meatless Monday? Or meatless UF, for that matter. If meat really is this bad 
and pointless, why are we allowing this scourge on our 
campus at all? 
Shouldn’t we be looking out for our students, protect-
ing them from the bad choices they may make?
Sure, we want college students to feel like they’re 
adults, but we can’t really trust them to make the right decisions — even the most basic ones like what to eat. 
So, to the Meatless Monday folks, I say: Press on, 
fight the good fight for making other people’s decisions 
for them under the assumption that the average lay-
man doesn’t have the time or wherewithal to truly know what’s best for himself or herself. 
I mean, really, where would we be if we let people 
truly exercise personal freedom? Nowhere good, that’s 
for sure.

Obama right to include 
Native American in book 
Not even behind the protective veil of a children’s book 
can President Barack Obama avoid falling through the thin ice of political controversy.
As his first children’s book, “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter To 
My Daughters,” was released Wednesday, media outlets 
criticized Obama for certain aspects of the book. Obama ac-
knowledges 13 historical figures in “Of Thee I Sing,” all of whom he says possessed traits he now sees in his daughters, Sasha and Malia. 
And Fox News just couldn’t take it anymore when Obama 
listed the Lakota medicine man   Sitting Bull, who defeat-ed Gen. George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn, for his leadership qualities. 
Now, Obama’s innocently designed book that begins with 
the line “Have I told you lately how wonderful you are?” is being labeled as the president’s latest anti-American move. 
And we’re ashamed major media outlets and fellow citi-
zens are attacking a children’s book simply for its inclusion of one of the most important historical demographics of this country —  Native Americans.
To call the children’s book “anti-American” because it 
includes Sitting Bull rather than Gen. Custer is to deny the rights and history of the people who Americans ruthlessly 
slaughtered and forced onto reservations, and, furthermore, 
it suggests America should take no blame for the atrocities committed unto these people. 
Sitting Bull embodies the very essence of dissidence on 
which this country was founded.
The only thing that’s anti-American is not including a 
footnote to explain how America is the country it is today because of our ability to massacre technologically inferior na-tive people.
La Vida Loko
It’s become the fastest 
way to a morning full of regrets. And New York 
no longer wants any part of it.
Distributors will stop all 
shipments of the popular-culture blackout sensation Four Loko in the state of New York beginning Friday. 
Four Loko, the mon-
strous-sized malt liquor bev-erage, typically has an alco-hol content between 6 and 12 
percent and a caffeine con-
tent greater than an 8-ounce cup of coffee. This, research-ers and health officials say, is where things get “Loko.”
With the added caffeine, 
poor college students and others who drink the “black-out in a can” don’t feel the 
depressant effects of alco-
hol and, additionally, stay awake longer to drink a greater amount of alcohol. 
With its order set to be-
gin Friday, New York joins the list of growing states and universities that have banned the sale of the con-troversial drink, includ-ing Michigan, Washington, 
Temple University and the 
University of Rhode Island. 
And while we don’t 
support an outright, Pro-hibition-style ban on the beverage, we acknowledge something needs to be done about the dangerous effects of these caffeine-laced alco-
holic drinks. 
The list of universities 
that heavily recommend 
students avoid the drink is growing rapidly, and educa-tion plus moderation is the key to stopping Four Loko from becoming, well, Loko. 
Reverting to Prohibition-
style models will only birth the possibility for govern-mental resentment and inter -
state smuggling of the drink that has already secured its place in the palates of many. Nate Rushing

Letters to the Editor
Even though it’s still a week and a half 
away , Thanksgiving is a holiday of great importance to this nation and has a lot 
more history to it than people think. The day when Americans stuff their faces and get fat, 
at least more than they do on most days, is not 
just a holiday for eating. And it is not just a holiday for the pilgrims and Indians of Plym-outh Rock. Both historically and traditionally, this holiday is one of the most meaningful.
Most people associate Turkey Day with the 
landing of the Puritan Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock in 1620. It is a great image to see Europe-ans and Indians working together and coming 
together over a large feast. It is a great image 
for the early history of what would eventually become the United States. Though it helps to forget that within a hundred years, most of the Indian peoples in the area had been de-stroyed.
But Hallmark images and Indian Wars 
aside, the actual history of the holiday is even more interesting and much more modern than people think.
The tradition started, not in 1620, but in 
1863 right in the middle of the American Civil War. And it had nothing to do with Pilgrims or Indians. Instead, it was a holiday proposed by President Abe Lincoln to encourage the American people to give thanks and increase national morale. It was also in part to help the Americans celebrate the victories the Union Army had won that year, especially the bat-tles fought at Gettys-burg and Vicksburg.
The holiday for giving thanks continued 
throughout the war and beyond, as people celebrated the return of the soldiers and the victory of the Union. As the years and decades went by, the holiday became more popular, especially when advertisements started to link Turkey Day to the pilgrims and the earlier days of the nation, something that the holiday originally had nothing to do with.
The holiday changed very little after that, 
with the exception of a date change imple-mented by President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930’s to try and stimulate the economy , but besides that Thanksgiving remained much the same.
Now a days, Thanksgiving seems to be be-
coming the forgotten holiday, with stores and malls, and even radio stations, skipping it en-tirely , going from celebrating Halloween and straight through to Christmas.
Some say it’s because the holiday is not 
politically correct. There are even protests against it by Indian Rights groups who feel that Thanksgiving, along with holidays like Columbus Day, mark the beginning of the end of Indian culture and way of life.

State University. Read the rest at UWire.comLacrosse player speaks out about fans
Since the beginning of this year, I’ve watched certain UF 
fans express more negativity toward UF athletes and coaches than I ever thought possible. 
By the time we’re done with our 5 a.m. practices, class-
es, afternoon lifts, evening practices and studying, we rare-
ly have the time or the energy to keep our eyes open long 
enough to read letters to the editor like Alexander Soucek’s on Wednesday. However, after having recently just torn my ACL, I seem to have just enough extra time to finally stand up for my fellow athletes and say comments like Soucek’s are getting old.  
How many fair-weather fans have ever run sprints for an 
hour straight, puked from exhaustion and then been expected to not only get through a three-hour practice but to improve? 
We have. How many of you have ever been sacked by a 300-
pound linebacker, gotten back up for the next play and still had the poise to complete a beautiful pass? John Brantley has.  How many of you have ever put up seven points and gotten nine rebounds in 15 minutes playing against the best college prospects? Patric Young has. 
Now, if any of you answered “yes” to these questions, 
which I doubt happened because the number of Division-1 athletes at this school is proportionately low, ask yourself 
this: Do you think you could still find the will to do it after 
reading what some of your supposed fans write about you in the Alligator?  
We somehow manage to drown out the uninformed and 
hurtful opinions and give our best effort during and after competition.
Lately a majority of fans make it pretty hard to do so, but 
we’re still hanging on. And yes, you might argue we signed up for public scrutiny when we decided to play college sports. And you’re right, we did. 
But I could just as easily argue you chose to be a Florida 
Gator, and in doing so you accepted the responsibility of sup-
porting your fellow students through good and bad.  
Do us a favor and back off. If you have something uncon-
structive and negative to say, go for it in private.
Soucek, next time you witness one of us put on a less-than-
desirable or uninspired performance, it might just be our way 
of saying we are unsatisfied with you as a fan and your in-ability to inspire us to play well. 
So, to Soucek and any other Florida fan, I think it’s about 
time you take one giant step out of your flip-flops and try and 
take a walk in our cleats.

Block tuition saves students money
Perhaps Alden Gillespy should have looked up the defi-
nition of discrimination before writing his Wednesday guest 
column.
Or maybe he just wanted to grab peoples’ attention by us-
ing inflammatory words.
Either way, the UF Board of Trustees isn’t considering 
block tuition because it doesn’t care about financially disad-vantaged students. In fact, one can argue encouraging stu-dents to graduate on time is actually beneficial to those who have to work in order to attend college.
This is clear when you see the opportunity cost of attend-
ing school for an extra year means forgoing a job in which you could be making more than $40,000 that same year. When you look at the big picture, graduating on time is actu-ally significantly cheaper. Also, I think the key phrase here is: on time. It’s called a four-year degree for a reason, so I don’t 
see how wanting students to graduate within four years is 
unreasonable.
The main argument against block tuition seems to be stu-
dents will have to pay for credits they are not taking. How-ever, when you stop to consider nearly 80 percent of all un-dergraduates at UF have Bright Futures scholarships, that argument seems to hold much less weight. And even though Bright Futures has capped its contribution to $125 per credit hour, the fact I’m taking 17 credits this semester and only had 
to pay $700 in tuition to attend the top public school in Flori-
da doesn’t really bother me. 
For the average student who will be going from 12 to 15 
credit hours, it will cost them an extra $129 per semester, which you can probably equate to one week’s paycheck. Even for students who only have the $94 per credit hour Medallion scholarship, the difference in tuition that will be paid out of pocket is $222. Plus, taking an extra class or two in the fall or spring is better than taking classes during the summer, which 
aren’t covered by Bright Futures at all. 
Most degree programs at UF have a minimum require-
ment of 120 credits to graduate, and if you’re only taking 12 
credits each semester, you’ll have to either pay for summer classes completely out of pocket or increase your overall cost of education by staying an extra year.
The Princeton Review consistently ranks UF as one of the 
nation’s top party schools as well as one of the schools where students study the least.

The products sold at Gainesville 
farmers markets may not all come 
from local family-owned farms. They could be shipped from hun-dreds of miles away or even from other countries. 
Gainesville is surrounded by a 
plethora of family-owned farms. But even with these options, wholesale and retail produce is sneaking its way into area farm-ers markets. 
“They’re called peddlers,” said 
Sandy Rodgers, owner of Piney Woods Farm, which grows pro-duce and flowers.
Peddlers, a common term 
among farmers, are people who buy produce from wholesale markets or retail grocers and re-sell them as fresh-picked goods at local farmers markets. 
They may sell the retail pro-
duce exclusively or along with food they’ve grown.
Alexis Riffel, a fourth-year 
business major with a focus in sustainability, has shopped at farmers markets since her fresh-man year. But she just learned that not all of the vendors grow their produce. 
Riffel buys her produce from 
The Family Garden, a family-owned farm in Gilchrist Coun-ty that sells its products in Gainesville. She said they told her about the peddlers.
“They didn’t tell us who it 
was,” Riffel said. “They just told us to be wary if we go down-town.”
When asked about peddlers, 
most growers at Gainesville’s markets seemed immediately uncomfortable and refused to give any specific names or opin-ions. But Rodgers willingly spoke about the topic.
“There’s a pretty strong feeling 
among farmers about peddlers,” she said.
She knows people who sell 
wholesale goods at local mar -
kets, and she even used to do it at a small market in Keystone Heights.
Some customers walked away 
after learning they were retail goods, she said. Others didn’t care. 
“They just want that pretty red tomato,” she said. “They don’t care where it comes from.”
She explained that in some 
cities, reselling can be profitable enough to live on. 
Some peddlers resell from 
small family-owned farms, but others are selling food that comes from hundreds of miles away or even other countries.
Rodgers said she knew a resell-
er who buys food from Rainbow Produce, 2420 NE 19th Drive, and sells it at smaller markets outside of Gainesville. 
Jack Maas, the owner of Rain-
bow Produce, said that up to 20 percent of what his store sells during harvest season, from about October until about June, is purchased from local farms. 
“If it’s in season and it’s around, 
we’ll jump on it,” he said. 
The rest mostly comes from 
California.
Gainesville has about 10 major 
farmers markets, each with about 20 to 40 vendors. Most vendors are growers, but peddlers are there, too. 
Charlie Lybrand, founder and 
market manager of the Union Street Farmers Market downtown, said he has asked vendors to stop selling at his market because they weren’t growers. 
“We’ve had issues and we’ve 
had to get rid of those people,” Lybrand said.
Vendors at the Union Street 
market monitor each other, he said. They usually alert him to any problems. 
If consumers want to avoid 
buying from resellers, the best thing to do, according to Rodgers, is to ask questions. 
Ask where the food was grown, 
where the farm is and who owns it. Some farms, like Kumarie’s Or -
ganic Garden located in Alachua, even allow customers to volun-teer at the farm — helping grow the food they will eventually eat. 
According to Riffel, it’s best 
to establish a relationship with a farmer and shop mostly from them. Since choosing to shop al-most exclusively with The Family Garden, she said she couldn’t be happier.
The Alachua County Farm-
ers Market is a county-enforced, growers-only market. 
Consumers who shop there 
will buy their produce, dairy or meats from the farmers who pro-duced it. It started in 1989 and is held every Saturday from 8:30 a.m. until noon. 
Market manager Jared Sweat 
said because it’s a growers-only market, it’s different from other markets in the area. According to him, people who vend there are more personally involved in the product, which attracts consum-ers. 
“Peddlers have a mentality 
that they just want to get rid of the produce,” he said. “Here, people actually care.”8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2010

SMILING FACES TO SOLDIERS.

When Marielle Ness’s father, Lt. Col. 
James Ness, told her about the local 
kids who give him and other soldiers the thumbs up as they drive the streets of the green zone in Kabul, Afghani-
stan, it ignited an idea for a project. 
She wanted to take pictures of 
Americans and people from around 
the world giving a thumbs up and send them back to Afghanistan to be given out to the kids in the streets of Kabul. But because the thumbs up can have a negative meaning in Middle Eastern cultures, she decided to just take pic-
tures of people smiling. She named her 
project Operation Civilian Outreach.
“It is putting a face to the enemy; 
not all of us carry machine guns,” she said.
So far the political science junior has 
received 50 pictures of smiling faces from the United States, Germany, Hol-land, Great Britain, Kenya and Austra-
lia. 
On Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., she will have a booth for Operation 
Civilian Outreach at the Culture Clash event at Lakeside Complex where she will be taking pictures of smiling faces. Ness said she hopes this will launch the project on the UF campus. 
“It is really for the kids,” she said. 
“It shows someone that we are human, and we are a big international commu-
nity.”
At the booth, people will also be 
able to write notes to soldiers in Af-
ghanistan. Ness will send these to her friend Kyle Anderson, who is serving in northern Afghanistan, to hand out to soldiers.
Ness hopes to get at least 200 photos 
at Sunday’s event. People can join the 
Facebook group or send in their own 
photos to operationcivilianoutreach@gmail.com.
“It is easy, simple and it is doing 
something,” she said.Student sends smiles

‘Produce Peddlers’ bring retail goods to farmers marketsBy LIDIA DINKOVA

Bands rocked for charity to help students 
increase their FCAT scores and decrease 
their chances of suffering from obesity. 
Wednesday night’s Veggie-palooza! 
event at Lillian’s Music Store, 112 SE First 
St., was held by the School Health Interdis-
ciplinary Program to raise money for stu-
dents at local elementary schools.
The bands that performed at the event 
included Krazee, Janna Pelle and the Half-
Steps and singers Anna Marie and Jessica 
Jones. 
Rawlings, Myra Terwilliger, Lake Forest 
and Idylwild elementary schools are con-
sidered to be located in high-crime areas.
About five students from the group’s 
25 volunteers go to each of these schools 
once a week to reinforce concepts students 
learned in class through fun and engaging, hands-on experiments.  
They hoped to raise $500 and expected 
about 70 people to attend, according to 
Lyndsey van der Laan, student coordinator 
for the group.
“Our motivation is to further their edu-
cation into college because most of these 
kids don’t come from a background where 
their parents went to college,” 
van der Laan said. “It’s to in-
still hope in these children for 
their future.” 
Money raised from Veggie-palooza! will 
be used to buy more supplies for experi-
ments the volunteers plan for the students. 
Lessons have ranged from a variety of 
topics, including anatomy, statistics, differ -
ent types of energy and chemical reactions. 
“It’s just a way for them to understand 
and remember the concepts when the FCAT comes because they did something with it 
that was fun,” van der Laan said.Veggie-palooza promotes

Dude, where’s my wand? How to honor Harry Potter 
  By JON SILMAN
 avenue writer
 It’s bittersweet. Your heart swells, 
but it aches, too. There are only two 
“Harry Potter” movies left. The saga that deﬁ  ned your youth is parachuting to its ﬁ  nal destination into collective 
pop culture memory. So you need to 
celebrate this momentous occasion. But how? Faster than you can say (in-sert spell name here), the Avenue has you covered. 1. Go to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando
 In this place, the magic is in the 
details. The snow-topped Hogsmeade Village, Hogwarts and the Hogwarts 
Express are all here in painstakingly 
intricate detail. Things to look out for: an animated Marauder’s Map, the ac-tual Time-Turner Hermione used in the movie and J.K. Rowling-sanctioned But-terbeer (try it frozen). There is no better way to get into the spirit of Pottermania than to visit the quintessential manifes-
tation of the franchise, which just hap-
pens to be a road trip away.
 2. Throw a party 
 Who doesn’t love a theme party? 
Poorly recreate Harry Potter dishes from 
Internet recipes concocted by people with way too much time on their hands. Have all the movies playing on a loop in 
every room of your house and try your 
hand at the ultimate Potter drinking game, “The Wisest Wizard.” You stack empty beer cans on top of each other 
after you drink them, and whoever has 
the tallest staff wins the award of wisest (drunkest) wizard.
 3. Get book smart 
 Believe it or not, some people don’t 
know the pure, unadulterated glory that 
is sinking into a “Harry Potter” novel and losing two weeks of your life. Seriously, 
the movies are good, but they pale in 
comparison to the original material. In fact, have a Potter book-reading mara-thon that lasts from now until the movie 
comes out.
 4. Dress up like the characters 
 Sure, you’re probably not going to 
live it down. Yes, it is super nerdy. But 
you only live once, one day at a time. Why not do some real living and dress up like Hagrid for the premiere? You can get your girlfriend to dress up like Snape 
and really get the party started by fero-
ciously making out in front of your fellow Pottermaniacs.
 The gift that keeps on giving
   Dear Jared,
  
  My girlfriend’s birthday is coming up, 
and I want to do something special and sexy. I feel like women definitely have it easy when it comes to these kind of gifts (us gentlemen just can’t pull off a strip-tease or lingerie as easily). 
  I was thinking about a back rub, but 
I really want it to be memorable. What other things can I do for her big day? How do I let her know it’s not a gift to myself?    Thanks,  Birthday Sex
    Ladies in the audience, how many of 
you wouldn’t want to see your boy-friend bust out the bow tie and pull off 
his buttoned pants Chippendale-style just for you?
  Anybody have their hand up?   Ladies, can I get a we-love-our-naked-
boyfriends whoop-whoop in the house? 
  So, Birthday, to assume your girlfriend 
wouldn’t want a teensy striptease is to as-sume that action is reserved for the ladies. And we all know it’s not.
  Although I wouldn’t recommend introduc-ing scarves or color guard-sized ﬂ  ags into your demo just yet, a 
little teasing action is 
rarely rejected. 
  But then again, 
making your girl-
friend feel special on 
her birthday is rarely about how naked you 
can get. 
  Making your girlfriend feel special often 
means surprising her at work, sending her ﬂ  owers without her asking, making dinner even when you’re a horrible cook. Making this day memorable will mean making her 
feel beautiful.
  Rose petals and hand-written notes left 
across the house are some of the sexiest 
gifts a boy can give. Of course, crotchless panties come in at a close second. 
  Show her how much you care for her by 
doing ordinary-to-you but extraordinary-to-her things, and you might get a gift for your-self on her special day.
 Have a question for our resident sex-
pert? Send Jared an e-mail at Jmisner@
alligator.org. Your name will not appear in print or online.

Harry Potter and the 
Deathly Hallows: Part 1
Grab your wands and robes because this’ll be one of 
the last times you’ll get to see Harry & Co. battle the Dark Lord on the big screen. In round one of the ﬁ  nal installment of the hit phenomenon, which is based on J.K. Rowling’s book series, things just keep getting worse 
for Harry, Ron and Hermione. Will the three amigos 
persevere and live to see the day of Voldemort’s defeat? Let’s also not forget that there’s one more movie after this, so no need to mourn the demise of your childhood just yet. ALISTEach Thursday, the Avenue is serving up the best in entertainment, pop culture and everything in between. 
From the big screen to the radio waves, check out this week’s picks. THEsee What’s My 
Name?
We know the answer to this ques-
tion: Rihanna! The Barbadian songstress 
continues her radio domination with this sway-worthy tune for which she’s gotten some help from rumored ﬂ  ame Drake. 
The chemistry between Weezy’s protege 
and Chris Brown’s ex is undeniable, but seriously, Riri, we all know your name.listen Decoded
 Jay-Z’s already made it big in the 
music scene and has embarked on 
numerous entrepreneurial ventures, including 
opening his own restaurant, owning part of the New Jersey Nets and starting his own clothing 
line. It seems natural that the next step would be 
to write about it — oh wait, that’s just what he did. The rapper just released a new semi-tell-all book on how he feels about the music industry today, what his songs are about and how he hit hip-hop jackpot. readBy MELINDA CARSTENSEN

Getting over the semester slump with 13 days to go
By KAT BEIN
avenue writer
It’s perhaps the most hellish of 
semester circumstances for stu -
dents: We’re finished with midterms 
but still have weeks to go before we can say so long to fall semester and 
hello to winter break.
Welcome to the semester 
slump.
It can be tough getting through 
this academic limbo. Half of your 
mind is set on finishing up that two million — OK, fine, it’s only eight — page paper about the evolution of igloos in 17th century Europe. The 
other half? All that turkey you’re 
about to consume next week. And then, to think that about two weeks after that, you’ll be rockin’ around the Christmas tree (hopefully after you’ve rocked all your exams). And it’s going to be glorious.
And now we’re just rambling.The Avenue knows you need a 
little inspiration right about now, and to help you out, we asked pro -
fessors and TAs across campus to think back to a time when they were in your shoes. 
They let us know where they 
made their mistakes and what they wish they’d done differently, what surprised them after graduating 
and anything (and everything) they 
wished they would have known back in their dorm days. 
Here are our 13 favorite bits of 
wisdom — one for each school day of the semester left, including to -
day.
Take their word for it, students — 
after all, they’re grading your finals.“I wish I would have 
gotten to know my profes-
sors a little bit better.”
- Brandon Roberts, applied 
physiology and kinesiology“I think it would have 
been good to take advantage of [Career Resource Center] ser-vices … and I wish I would have understood better that you don’t 
have to go to class with a cough 
because it’s more annoying for the professor, and you get better faster if you just stay home.”- Joann Mossa, geography“I was in Berkeley in the 
‘60s when things were very ac-
tive … I thought when I was a professor it would be normal for students to stand up and protest … there’s always something you can do.”
- Scott Nygren, English (film and 
media studies)
“I would 
have gone to 
the gym more. Take advantage of everything 
that’s available on 
campus. It’s all in one place.”- Amanda Vincent,         
  French

“Grades are less important than I thought.”- Zack Gilmore, anthropology
“More involvement in extracurricular activities, like Student Government — things like that. The networks you make and community with other peo-ple I found in life are more valuable 
than sitting in your dorm room doing 
nothing.”- Paul Borsa, applied physiology and kinesiology
“I wish I would have known 
more about what opportunities 
were available after graduating. I was a bit narrow with my choices I was involved with.”
-Ben Dunn, biochemistry and 
molecular biology“I wish I could have been more 
conscientious in general, as far as being on time and things like that.”- James Dominguez, applied physi-
ology and kinesiologyWords of Wisdom from the people who grade your finals...
 “I wish I’d figured out earlier that I shouldn’t take classes that I didn’t like. No matter how 
good the descrip-
tion of a class seems or how important it seems for your course of study, it’s really important to love the classes you take, and I wish I would’ve done a 
little more shopping 
for courses a little earlier in my college career.”- Roger Beebe, English“I would have 
expended less effort 
on my personal life, i.e. girls. If I compare the effort I put into that to 
the effort I put into class 
work, I think I would have done better.”- Charlie Mitchell, theatre  
   and dance“It took years for me to understand that the real rea-
son I was in college was not to select a major. The 
real reason was to develop critical thinking and social skills that would serve me for a lifetime. I see today’s students at UF making exactly the same mistake. The major, the murky view of a particular career when one is 18 to 20, are far, far less important than developing skills of social responsibility, inclusivity and calm dis-course. Wish I had known that then.”- Carl Barfield, entomology and nematology
Rosa Taveras / Alligator Staff
Week by week, one by one, Hollywood regu -
lars like Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino, Audrina 
Patridge and Michael Bolton faced a tough real-ity: Not everyone makes it on the “Dancing with the Stars” parquet.
And now that the competition is down to the 
final three —  Jennifer Grey, Kyle Massey and Bris-tol Palin — the mirror-ball trophy is looking shinier than ever.
But on the other side of the TV screen, another 
competition is just heating up. Basketball season just kicked off, and if you’ve clamored courtside at a Gators game, you know it’s not easy keeping your eyes on the ball at all times. That’s because 
the basketball team has some serious compe -
tition — and we’re not just talking about their 
gameday opponents. Cue the Dazzlers: the 20-girl squad that one-ups the guys they’re cheering on with their every shake, shimmy and shout.
The Dazzlers show off their routines and 
amaze crowds at the men’s and women’s basket-ball games every season. When they aren’t at the basketball games, they're attending community 
service events, bringing extra spirit to gymnastics 
meets, performing at the Homecoming game each year and, well, being college students.
Want to know what it’s like to dance with 
the Dazzlers? The Avenue caught up with three members of the squad to learn more about what it takes to dazzle — on and off the court.
Christie Garcia, 20
 Do you watch the show “Dancing with the 
Stars” for inspiration?
I actually canceled my cable this year, but 
I had watched it before. I’m more of a “So You Think You Can Dance” fan. 
I enjoy watching it because we do a very spe-
cific style of dance and that show is a whole other world and a whole other performance aspect. A 
lot of the dances aren’t even that intricate, but I 
like watching them because they are performers and make the dances with their personalities. Who would be your dream dance partner? 
Justin Timberlake, for sure, because I’ve 
watched him since *NSYNC. What is your favorite part of being a Dazzler? My favorite part is the fact that I’ve just made 
so many great friends and [enjoy] performing at the games with them.
Courtney Kennedy, 21
 Do you watch the show “Dancing with the 
Stars” for inspiration?
I used to. I watched a few seasons at the very beginning. I think that it opens a lot of people’s 
lives to the dancing world. I definitely relate to 
it — it shows the hard work we put in. Ballroom dancing and dancing in general doesn’t get the attention that football and basketball do, so it puts media spotlight on dancing, and that’s one of the main things that I love about it. What is your favorite part of being a Dazzler?  
I think it’s definitely going out into the public 
and meeting people.We do a lot of pep rallies and 
charity events and get to meet a lot of fans. I’ve 
been on the team for four years, and it’s definitely touching every time you meet a fan and they say, “That was awesome,” or, “Thank you for what you do.”  
Lauren Klein, 22
 Do you watch the show “Dancing with the 
Stars” for inspiration?
I like Julianne Hough, the girl that was on it 
a while ago, and now she’s in Proactiv commer -
cials. I liked her, but that was a while ago.
 Who would be your dream dance partner?  
Usher. He can dance really well. 
 What is your favorite part of being a Daz-
zler?  
Getting to do the community appear -
ances and seeing the difference we make in 
a child’s face or someone that looks up to 
us and just realizing the opportunity we’ve 
been given by being a Dazzler.
 Do you do anything to pump up for 
events?  
It’s usually something involving an en-
ergy drink and a lot of hairspray and makeup in the dressing room. We all have really funny sto -
ries throughout the day, and we spend so much 
time in the dressing room of the O’Connell Cen-
ter, so that’s a bonding time for us.

Building a Beast in the Blue
   By Allison Banko 
 Alligator Writer
    Beads of sweat trickle down their faces as their 
pummeling ﬁ  sts crash against each other’s stiff palms. Jump ropes graze the ground — a clack-
ing that permeates the O’Connell Center — forming a beat that could be counted with a metronome. 
  It’s boxing conditioning day for the Gators’ swim-
ming and diving squad, a team-favorite workout that skims the surface of its nine weekly practices.
  “I like boxing,” senior swimmer Conor Dwyer said. 
“If your core is in shape, it beneﬁ  ts you to be an all-around athlete.”
  The team doesn’t dabble in the pool for a cluster of 
laps to become elite athletes — that’s kids’ play. The men’s and women’s squads clock in 13 hours of train-
ing during a typical week, Monday through Saturday, 
including weight training, dry-land workouts and time spent in the pool.
  “We do what it takes to compete really well,” coach 
Gregg Troy said. “We do challenging stuff, but it’s race-relative.”
  Forming record-breakers and U.S. National Team 
swimmers extends far beyond the expected scribbled ex-ercises on a loose-leaf piece of paper — it takes a village. 
  
  Heavy Metal 
  Navigate over to justbig’s YouTube channel. It’s 
drenched with conditioning videos. One clip shows just-big ﬂ  ipping a 1500-pound tire down the road — that’s Matt DeLancey. 
  DeLancey is the assistant director of strength and 
conditioning for the Gators — the man behind the train-ing for UF’s volleyball, swimming and diving, and ﬁ  eld athletes.
  During a typical week, DeLancey meets with the 
swimmers at least three times to punch-in pump time in the Grifﬁ  n-Oakley Strength and Conditioning Complex that looms beneath The Swamp.
  “The atmosphere is intense, there’s no messing 
around,” junior Shara Stafford said. “Everyone becomes so focused and determined. It is one of my favorite plac-es to be.”
  No messing around, indeed. It isn’t a typical gym 
environment of towel-whipping and teasing alongside rusted dumbbells. This weight room features 25,000 square feet of workout space including weight and car-dio machines, wood platforms and a 50-yard long turf space lined with medicine balls — all tools that aid in the metamorphosis of an athlete to a champion. 
  And the discipline it takes to get there?  That lies in 
the rules established to ensure the athletes are always on point.  
  Upon their entry, they don’t dare disrespect UF by 
stepping on the giant, roped-off Gator head that’s print-ed on the ﬂ  oor.
  No wearing clothes that aren’t Gators-issued. No 
cell phones. No chit-chat. Be on time. And please, wipe down the pads.
  “Mom and Dad don’t work here,” DeLancey said.   It’s serious business that the Gators’ swimming and 
diving team squeezes every last drop out of. The team’s training program requires top-notch effort all fall to pre-pare for the Southeastern Conference and NCAA meets in the spring.
  “It makes for a very rigorous and intense training 
schedule that wears you down so much,” Stafford said. “But when we rest in the spring, we know we are going 
to be good because of all the work we put in throughout 
the fall.” 
  Since the team goes all-out in fall training, its dead 
tired for regular-season meets. But, a few weeks before SEC and NCAA time, they rest up to mark their qualify-ing times. 
  The strength workouts from DeLancey vary for each 
swimmer depending on the events that they compete in. The sprint swimmers meet more often than the oth-ers, and the whole squad is divided into four weight groups. 
  “Everyone’s got weaknesses that differ from the next 
one,” DeLancey said. 
  Ranging from medicine ball exercises to lifting to ply-
ometrics on the stadium steps, the team’s conditioning all translates to balling out in the water. 
  According to DeLancey, vertical jumping directly 
relates to starts and turns in swimming. Among other exercises, the swimmers also focus on arm stamina and endurance, key traits in the lanes. 
  DeLancey’s seven-year client, former Gators swim-
ming great Ryan Lochte, can be seen on the justbig chan-nel swinging and twirling 60-pound boat ropes to work 
out his guns. 
  Though Lochte graduated from UF’s swimming pro-
gram in 2006, the Olympic gold medalist still utilizes the 
O’Connell Center’s swimming facilities, practices with the team and trains with DeLancey. 
  However, Lochte trains with DeLancey strongman 
style, honing in on exercises such as heavy tire ﬂ  ipping and keg-throwing. 
  “It’s hard to be out of shape as a swimmer,” DeLancey 
said. “Swimming a mile is like running four miles. Our swimmers are deﬁ  nitely the most ﬁ  t group on campus.”
  
  Fueling Up
  The Gators get going before the sun has even brimmed 
across the horizon. At 6 a.m., the team kicks off its ﬁ  rst practice of the day, lasting until 8 a.m. Then comes the day of classes. The team returns at around 2 p.m. for the day’s second practice. At 5 p.m., they round out their ath-
letic day and transition to tutoring sessions and study-
ing. With jam-packed weekdays and competition-ﬁ  lled weekends, the fuel the Gators down isn’t taken lightly.
  The Gators’ director of sports nutrition, Cheryl 
Zonkowski, explained that the athletes’ nutrition is ad-dressed almost immediately in their initial freshman physical, covering all bases ranging from eating habits to weight and medical history to blood sugar sensitivities.  
  “We go over what their eating history was like in 
high school and at home and ﬁ  gure out what we can do so they can eat similarly so that they can perform well here,” she said.  
  This includes their introduction to the Gator Training 
Table, an area designated for student-athletes in Gator Corner Dining Center that contains a special menu de-signed by nutritionists.
  Most of the swim team comes in to eat at the table 
after practice. 
  Staff members are available at meal times to answer 
nutrition-related questions, and Zonkowski said the swimmers are most unique in their nutritional inquiries.
  “Swimmers are very, very detail-orientated,” she said. 
“They want to do all of the little things right.”
  For athletes who compete in an event where one one-
hundredth of a second matters, they thrive on detail. 
  But maintaining nutritional structure is challenging 
with more than half of the season’s meets on the road. The Gators’ nutrition squad has it covered, though.
  The team has food — tailored to each swimmer’s 
dietary needs — delivered to the pool deck or hotel for away meets, ensuring that the athletes are fueled prop-erly and efﬁ  ciently.
  “Their time on the road is very valuable,” Zonkowski 
said. “We want to make sure that they have the time they need to take online quizzes, study and stretch so they aren’t wasting time at restaurants.”
  This weekend, the Gators travel to Atlanta for the 
three-day Georgia Tech Invitational. Both the men and women are ranked No. 4 in the College Swimming Coaches’ Association of America national poll. 
  The Gators are returning to competition for the ﬁ  rst 
time in two weeks — meaning they got to attend the 
football game against South Carolina after practice ﬁ  n-
ished up at around 11 a.m. on Saturday, following a quick nap.  
  “If you have any spare time during the day, we usu-
ally try to ﬁ  t a nap in,” Stafford said.  
  After all, beast mode needs recharging. UF swim team 
trains beyond water

UF Football
by KYlE MaIS tRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
 
Brandon Hicks has one regret 
from his senior season. 
And it has nothing to do with 
wins or losses. 
Hicks will play his last game in 
The Swamp on Saturday against 
Appalachian State, playing for 
pride on a 6-4 team that has al-ready missed out on its oppor -
tunity to play for a Southeastern Conference Championship. 
Hicks said this year’s Florida 
team wasn’t lacking the potential to be great. Instead, it took them too long for veterans like Hicks and 
the freshmen to become a team.
“We’re a very talented team on both sides of the ball,” Hicks said. 
“I wish camaraderie would’ve came a whole lot sooner.”
UF brought in 27 players and 
the No. 2 recruiting class, accord-
ing to Rivals.com, including four 
five-star and 17 four-star athletes.
Right from the beginning, the 
integration process to the team 
was rough, making headlines 
when senior and team leader Mike Pouncey delivered a strong mes-sage to the first-year players dur -
ing preseason camp. 
“At the end of the day, the 
freshmen need to just shut their mouths and come play,” Pouncey said. “They haven’t done anything 
on Saturday, and most of the fans 
don’t even know who they are. So, until they prove themselves, they just need to sit back and let the older guys play.”
When Pouncey and Hicks ad-
dressed the media this week, 
both said they wish they could’ve 
bonded with the 
freshmen earlier 
in the season.
Hicks said 
the team needed the freshmen to come along fast-er and contrib-
ute right away, 
something that didn’t happen. 
Freshman defensive tackle 
Sharrif Floyd, a five-star recruit who has made a big impact as of 
late and was named defensive player of the week by coach Urban Meyer after the Vanderbilt game, confirmed what Pouncey and Hicks said. 
“It started off a little shaky, then 
we started bringing it together, started being a team instead of seg-regated,” Floyd said. 
Not all of the freshmen felt that 
way, though. 
Cornerback Cody Riggs, who 
has seen a lot of playing time this season and replaced starter Jeremy Brown midway through the Geor -
gia game, said his relationship with the veterans in his position group — Janoris Jenkins, Moses Jenkins and Brown — has always 
been a positive one. 
Riggs came into offseason camp as the last cornerback and formed 
a strong relationship with Brown, who he is now competing with for playing time.
“I’m with Jeremy more than 
anybody on the team,” Riggs said. “I look up to him. He helps me even when I was playing, he would talk to me on the sideline and tell me 
what I’m doing wrong.”
The seniors say their relation-
ships with the young players are 
much better now with three games left in their careers.
But who knows what could 
have been if they had come togeth-er sooner? 
“That’s one of the things I wish 
we could’ve done better,” Hicks said.
Seniors lament early season issues with freshmen
� WILLIAMS IS THE NO. 7 CENTER IN THE NATION.
by toM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
 
Less than 24 hours after Ohio State blew out Florida 93-
75 in the O’Connell Center, the Gators lost another battle 
with the Buckeyes.
This time it was off the court, though.
Amir Williams, the No. 7 center in the nation (accord-
ing to Rivals.com), signed his national letter of intent with 
Ohio State on Wednesday, the final day of the fall signing 
period.The Beverly Hills (Mich.) Country Day four-star big 
man had narrowed his choices down to the two schools 
before ultimately inking with coach Thad Matta’s team.
“I’m feeling pretty good right now,” Williams told The Detroit News. 
“I just felt comfortable with everything they were tell-
ing me at Ohio State. I felt comfortable with the players and the coaching staff. They’ve been successful in sending 
a lot of good players to the pros, and I hope to get to the NBA one day.” 
At 6 feet 9 inches and 220 pounds, Williams would 
have been a huge signing for the Gators, as the team’s 
starting frontcourt — Chandler Parsons, Alex Tyus and 
Vernon Macklin — consists of seniors, and depth in the middle could be a concern next season.
With Williams spurning the Gators, the team’s 2011 
recruiting class still only has one signee — five-star shoot-ing guard Brad Beal.Four-star center chooses Buckeyes over GatorsHicks

Beverly Hills (Mich.) Country Day four-star recruittransition while also being a key distributor in half-court sets. 
The freshman guard led the Gators in scoring against UCF and led the team in assists both games.Through two contests, Bonds is averaging 9.5 points, 4.5 assists and 2.5 rebounds. 
The two share minutes at the point, part of a rotation But-
ler has employed at each position thus far. Only one player has played more than 30 minutes for the Gators (Jordan Jones against Charlotte). 
“You can look at the stats. First five doesn’t mean that these 
are our best five players,” Butler said of the starters. “It just means, here’s who we think is going to do the best job of setting the tone.”
The starting lineup remained the same against Charlotte and 
included Bartley and freshman Kayla Lewis, another of the new-
comers making an early difference.
The 5-foot-11 guard presents matchup problems due to her 
size and quickness. Her versatility has shown itself in 14 points, 
11 rebounds and three key blocks so far. Lewis’ 56 minutes are the most of any newcomer and are second on the team. But the Gators have been at their best when freshmen Brittany Shine and Deaundra Young join Lewis and Bartley or Bonds in the lineup. 
Shine, a self-described “sparkplug,” allows UF to keep its en-
ergy when a starter needs a breather. The freshman came off the 
bench to score 11 points against Charlotte, including nine in a 
two-minute span, and sparked UF to a 14-point lead. 
Young’s 14 rebounds in 34 minutes this season brings an 
added dimension to UF’s inside game that will be desperately needed against DePaul in the semifinals.
The Blue Demons, led by the dominant forward duo of 
Keisha Hampton (18.5 ppg) and Felicia Chester (16.5 ppg) will test Young and the interior of the Gators’ defense.
“This is a road game and a whole new experience for our 
young team,” Butler said. 
“It’s going to be a huge challenge to keep them from doing 
what they want to do. We’re going to have to step up and make plays.”THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Appalachian State quarterback DeAndre Presley leads the team 
in rushing with 727 yards and 11 touchdowns.
Demps expected to miss practice for rest of year
touchdowns.
Presley has also passed for 2,066 yards and 17 touchdowns 
against four interceptions. 
“He’s a challenge as a quarterback because he can do 
things on his own,” defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. 
“He can make a play out of nothing. Our challenge is to get the ball out of his hands as much as possible.” 
Florida has struggled at times against dual-threat quarter -
backs this season, most notably against South Florida’s B.J. Daniels, who gained 107 yards against the Gators on Sept. 11.
“I feel like if we prepare the right way, then we have noth-
ing to worry about,” linebacker Lorenzo Edwards said. “As long as we come out and do our job in practice and study our plays on film, then we’ll do just fine.”
Bostic’s role shrinking: Linebacker Jon Bostic has been 
limited in practice this week with a bruised sternum, an in-jury he suffered Nov. 6 against Vanderbilt. 
But Bostic was struggling to get on the field even before 
the injury. After starting Florida’s first five games, Bostic has not started since Oct. 2 against Alabama. 
“He’s really inconsistent right now as a player,” Austin 
said. “And you get that as you go through the grind, learning how to each week do the same things over and over, develop-ing a routine.”
Demps missing practice: Meyer expects running back Jeff 
Demps to miss practices for the rest of the season. Demps suf-fered a stress fracture in his left foot Sept. 18 against Tennes-see and has been unable to play at full speed since then.
After rushing for 237 yards in Florida’s first two games, 
Demps has gained just 250 more yards in six games while sit-
ting out two other contests.
“It’s real frustrating,” Meyer said. “That was our No. 1 
playmaker going into the season. It’s been devastating on all fronts.”
Other injuries: Defensive tackle Jaye Howard (ankle) has 
practiced at full speed this week while linebacker A.J. Jones 
(hamstring) has sat out, Austin said.FOOTBALL , from page 20the first half.”
Seven of the team’s 18 turnovers 
came from junior point guard Erv-
ing Walker. 
Although Ohio State was content 
to sit back in its half-court defense, 
Walker frequently made wild drives 
to the hoop that usually ended with 
a turnover or errant pass.  
Donovan said Walker was guilty 
of trying to do too much down the stretch, when a better course of ac-
tion might have been to find an open 
teammate in the post. 
Florida’s guards frequently fed 
their interior players over the first 
20 minutes, resulting in 20 field 
goal attempts from the paint. In the second half, however, that number dropped to eight. 
“I applaud his competitiveness 
and wanting to win and his fire, but he’s not going to be able to do it all by himself,” Donovan said. 
Walker, who is beginning his sec-
ond year at the point guard position after playing off the ball as a fresh-man, is still learning the nuances of running the team on both ends of the floor. 
The Gators frequently allowed 
the Buckeyes to get uncontested looks off inbound plays, 
something Dono-
van wants Walker to identify, control and prevent. 
“As a point guard, you’ve got to 
get our team matched up,” Donovan said. 
Donovan also expects Walker 
to control the tempo of the game 
on the offensive end, something he 
struggled to do in the team’s opener against UNC-Wilmington. 
In an attempt to establish UF’s 
frenetic pace, Walker sometimes 
rushed the Gators into situations 
where it might have been better to slow down, rest and focus on get-ting a basket. 
“There’s times when we get out 
on the break and the ball is not in his hands and he needs to take more command of going and getting the ball and settling us down,” Donovan 
said after UF’s opener. “There’s got 
to be a better awareness of Erving to sit there, put the ball under his arm-pit and say, ‘Whoa, let’s slow down 
and get what we need.’”
Injuries: The Gators will enter 
tonight’s game without senior for -
ward Alex Tyus, who suffered a 
mild concussion against OSU. 
Senior center Vernon Macklin, on 
the other hand, will play despite a knee injury that has limited him in practice the last few days.Donovan wants

Billy Donovan attributed Tuesday’s 
93-75 loss against Ohio State primarily to 
what he called the double-D: decisions 
and discipline. 
No. 9 Florida’s defeat was due to turn-
overs and a lack of intensity down the 
stretch, areas it will have a chance to im-
prove upon tonight when it squares off against North Carolina A&T (1-2) at 7 in the O’Connell Center.  
“The biggest key for our team is, can 
we become more disciplined and can we 
make good decisions in what we’re do-
ing?” Donovan said. “I thought for about 30 minutes we were pretty good and did a good job, and then I thought we really broke down in those areas.”
With 12:29 left in the game, the Gators 
held a 57-56 lead on the No. 4 Buckeyes. But from there, UF (1-1) committed 11 
turnovers and allowed Ohio State to shoot 74 percent from the field.  “Beating them in the first half is ir -
relevant,” senior Chandler Parsons said. “We’ve got to continue to get better, con-tinue to execute and continue to play de-fense throughout the whole game, not just

Florida’s success depends on the 
greenhorns this season.
Coach Amanda Butler knows if the 
Gators are to avenge last year’s poor 
showing, the fresh faces have to step in 
and make a difference.
Well, so far, so good.
Two games into the season, the Gators 
(2-0) are riding high off consecutive last-minute wins and will travel to Chicago to take on DePaul University in the semifi-nals of the Preseason Women’s NIT to-night at 8.
Nearly in position for a tournament 
title, it’s the performance of those new additions, especially point guards Jaterra Bonds and Lanita Bartley , that UF has to thank for guiding it.
Bartley , starting both games at the 
point, is averaging nine points, 2.5 assists and 3.5 rebounds in only 21.5 minutes.
But it’s been her 
play without the ball in her hands that is gar -
nering attention.
Bartley has accumu-
lated seven steals due to frequently disrupt-ing inbounds plays and jumping passes on 
defense. The junior transfer has been a constant catalyst of Butler’s fast-break of-fense and is a   dynamic playmaker who can shred defenses with her penetration.

Members of Florida’s defense will feel 
like they’re in practice when they line up 
against Appalachian State on Saturday, 
but not because of the typical mismatch found between FBS and FCS teams.
Coaches Urban Meyer and Jerry Moore 
spent a lot of time together in 2008 at the ESPY Awards, where Appalachian State was nominated for Best Upset after beat-ing Michigan 34-32 the season prior.
Since then, Moore has visited Gainesville 
three or four times, and the two coaches have exchanged ideas and formed similar offenses. But this year the Mountaineers 
seem to be more successful running the 
spread option than the Gators.Averaging 37 points, Appalachian 
State’s offense ranks fourth in the FCS. Florida, meanwhile, ranks 50th in the FBS 
with 29.6 points per game.
Free safety Will Hill feels confident in 
the defense’s ability to contain the Moun-
taineers, especially because he has prac-
ticed against a similar of-fense since August.
“It helps us out,” he 
said. “We just know 
that we’ve got to be dis-
ciplined on some of our schemes.”
The Gators will need 
to be especially disci -
plined as they tries to contain quarterback DeAndre Presley, who leads the Moun-taineers with 727 rushing yards and 11 Appalachian State to bring 
familiar scheme SaturdaySEE HOOPS, PAGE 19
