BATON ROUGE, La. — 
Florida fell back to earth on 
Saturday. Fortunately for the Gators, Atlanta is of this world.
No. 10 LSU ended the Tyler 
Murphy honeymoon with a 17-6 victory against No. 17 UF on Saturday in Tiger Stadium.
Despite another loss during 
which the offense did too little and the defense was asked to do too much, the Gators’ season is far from over. In fact, it begins next Saturday.
The road to the Southeast-
ern Conference Championship Game now goes through Fau-rot Field, home of undefeated SEC East leader Missouri.
“We still have everything on 
the table as far as Atlanta is con-cerned,” coach Will Muschamp said. “We need to take care of the SEC East. It is wide open, and it is all in our hands.”
Florida’s season may hinge 
on a tangle with another group of Tigers, but Saturday hurt.
In a statement game at the 
season’s midway point, the Gators crumbled in the same kind of three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust contest that was its bread and butter in 2012. The style brought UF within one game of Atlanta last season.
But the Gators (4-2, 3-1 SEC) 
failed to impose their will on Saturday, and it proved costly.
LSU (6-1, 3-1 SEC) out-
manned, outgunned and out-muscled Florida in the trenches. In a battle of stingy defensive units, the Tigers held stronger. In short, LSU stole Florida’s identity.
Les Miles won “The Mus-
champ Way.”
“We didn’t win enough on 
the line of scrimmage,” Mus-champ said.
Senior defensive tackle 
Damien Jacobs added: “They kind of beat us at our own game.”STILL IN THE HUNT

Chomsky is coming.
After much debate, Noam Chom-
sky, a prominent professor and polit-ical activist, will speak at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Tues-day at 8 p.m. at an event hosted by the Civic Media Center.
Tickets will be available at the 
Phillips Center today from noon to 6 p.m. 
The event is free and open to the 
public, but advance tickets are re-quired. 
An outdoor screen with seating 
will be available, as well as live-streaming of the speech from the CMC website. 
Robbie Czopek, coordinator for 
the Civic Media Center, said Chom-sky holds a special 
meaning to the cen-ter.
“He came and 
dedicated our ﬁ  rst location,” he said. “We approached him 10 years ago and brought him in for our 10th anni-
versary, and now we’re bringing him back a couple days before our 20th anniversary.” 
On his last visit, more than 6,000 
people crammed into the Stephen C. O’Connell Center to hear the re-nowned MIT professor speak about language and politics, he said. This year, Czopek expects the 1,700-seat Phillips Center to be full, even though Noam Chomsky to talk at UFCAMPUS

UF and Santa Fe College students can now 
ﬁ  nd out if a registered sex offender or predator 
is at their school with the release of a new online database on Florida’s Sex Offender Registry. 
The registry’s University Search database, 
which launched last week, collects informa-tion on more than 60,000 registered offenders statewide and lists those who attend or work at private or public colleges and universities.
UF doesn’t have any offenders enrolled or 
working at any of its three campuses listed in the database. At SFC, one offender is listed as enrolled at the college’s Northwest Campus off Northwest 83rd Street. 
“It’s important that each of us remains 
aware of our surroundings,” said Gerald Bai-ley, commissioner of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, in a statement. “With that in mind, the sex predator/offender campus-search function is a valuable source of public safety information.”
Ofﬁ  cials have always collected information 
on registered sex offenders at colleges state-wide, said FDLE spokeswoman Samantha Andrews. However, the information hasn’t al-ways been made public, she said, adding that the information on the registry is updated on a “real-time, continuous basis.”
In the spring, the Florida Legislature decid-
ed to allocate funds to the FDLE to create the Sex offender database now 
includes university search

Monkeys caused all kinds of 
chaos — and not for throwing fe-ces. Jean, Kim, Dorothy and Bar-bara, were four of 26 baboons being used at UF’s Animal Research Farm. While taking part in dental research, the monkeys were confined in spe-cially designed chairs that prevented motion for three months. Research-ers said they were vital in the experi-mentation process, and community members wanted to limit the use of animals in experiments.Oct. 13, 1981A couple filed suit against the UF 
Health Shands Hospital when they had a child they weren’t expecting. More than a simple “mistake,” the woman had had her tubes tied, a.k.a. bilateral laparoscopic tubal litiga-tion, two years earlier. The couple wanted the hospital to pay for not only raising their son until he’s 18, but also for physical and mental an-guish.

About 80 people gathered Satur-
day at the University Auditorium 
for a memorial service for Christian Aguilar, where UF representatives awarded him a posthumous degree and his family announced the release of a new search-and-rescue app. 
The service marked a year since 
the 18-year-old UF biomedical engi-neering freshman from Miami was found dead in Levy County after he had been missing for almost a month. Carlos and Claudia Aguilar, 
Christian’s parents, thanked the UF, Gainesville and Miami communities for their help during the search.
“It was a miracle we found him,” 
Carlos Aguilar, 45, said.
The family also praised local 
police officers for their help in the search and Pedro Bravo investiga-tion. Bravo, a 19-year-old former Santa Fe College student, is accused of killing Christian and faces mul-tiple felony charges. 
Dave Kratzer, vice president for 
student affairs, addressed the audi-ence and Aguilar family members on behalf of UF President Bernie Machen.
“Although Christian was a stu-
dent at UF here for a very short time,” he said, “we know Christian’s love of life extended to all of his pas-sions.”
Student Body 
Vice President Joselyn Rivas praised UF vol-unteers for their involvement in the search. 
Angela Lind-
ner, associate dean of the Col-
lege of Engineering, said Christian’s life and death created a bond in the community. 
“Christian still matters here,” 
she said, “as a tangible symbol of the permanent bond we have with Christian and his family.”Representatives from the engi-
neering college and UF’s Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers presented the Aguilar family with an In Memoriam biomedical engi-neering degree, which Lindner said was the first of its kind awarded to a deceased UF student. 
Gainesville Police Chief Tony 
Jones, speaking for the two dozen law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, said he and the officers would give the Aguilar fam-ily guidance as Bravo’s case moves to trial.
“We’ll give you some confidence 
as you maneuver through the next phase,” he said. 
The Aguilar family also an-
nounced the release of the Christian Aguilar Child Alert application.  The app, developed by the Missing Children Global Network, allows users to receive alerts about missing people and submit anonymous tips to police. 
“The whole idea is to help law 
enforcement (and) try to be their eyes in our communities,” said Ri-cardo Barredo, a representative of the MCGN Advisory Board.
Jonathan Moriarty, a 20-year-old 
UF electrical engineering sopho-more, met Christian when they at-tended Preview last summer. He said going to Saturday’s service was difficult.
“I don’t want to face that reality 
that I’m not going to bump into him on the sidewalk anymore,” he said.

Sixteen proposals have been chosen for the 
first $15 million round of UF’s preeminence 
funding after a month-long selection process.
Research into “big data” takes the lion’s 
share of $3.8 million, followed by neuroscience at $2.2 million and food security, safety and distribution systems at $1.45 million.
UF Provost Joe Glover said more than 40 
proposals were gathered from deans around campus. A committee of distinguished profes-sors reviewed the proposals with UF President Bernie Machen, who eventually decided on the 16 that would receive funds from preemi-nence.
“We wanted to invest in fields that will be 
important in the next 10 to 20 years,” Glover said.
At the moment, only $13.325 million of the 
money has a planned use for the first wave of proposals, he said. The committee hasn’t reached a conclusion on how to allocate the re-mainder.
He said the funds will be released to UF this 
Fall after he and president Machen present their plans to the Board of Governors in November, but the deans of UF’s colleges have already put their plans for the funds in motion.
Glover said he expects 75 to 100 new faculty 
members from preeminence funding, with the bulk of them on the tenure track. No professors have been chosen yet, but the search for new hires has already begun.
He said although the funds are going into 
research, the faculty brought on from new hires will bolster UF’s academics.
“We expect all the faculty we hire to be 
engaged in teaching as well,” he said. “We’re bringing very good researchers who will bring their expertise into the classroom.”
He said “big data” describes the massive 
amounts of information created with all human endeavors, ranging from scientific research into the Higgs-Boson particle to large databases such as Amazon.com.
“The storage, retrieval and analysis of all 
these data really require new techniques,” he said.
Charlotte Jung, a 19-year-old pre-pharmacy 
sophomore, said she wishes a portion of the money would go to improving meal plans on campus.
“I personally didn’t buy a meal plan last 
year or this year because the food was below standards of what a human should be putting in their body,” Jung said.
She said the liberal arts colleges should also 
receive more funding, as their programs aren’t paid as much attention as majors such as engi-neering.
Nathan Miles, a 21-year-old physics, math 
and astronomy senior, said he likes that the majority of the money is going into research because if it gives back new technologies, the university could easily make back its money.Proposals chosen for first

� ATTACKS WERE HUNG 
UNDER A TENT ON THE PLAZA OF THE AMERICAS.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writer

“The worst thing a Latino 
parent can have is a gay child.”
Those words still keep Gaby 
Larios from revealing her sexu-
ality to her family.
Pictures of expressionless  
faces holding dry-erase boards with LGBTQ attacks were on display at “The Weight of Your Words,” a celebration of Na-tional Coming Out Day pre-sented by LGBT Affairs and Pride Student Union.
“Gays will ruin this coun-
try,” “You will go to hell,” “I can’t love an abomination” and 40 other attacks were hung un-der a large tent on the Plaza of the Americas on Friday.
Students spanning the LG-
BTQ spectrum and transcend-ing race and socioeconomic sta-tus were at the gallery Friday. 
Pictures were taken after 
Pride meetings and in the Rain-bow Room of Peabody Hall. Students could also take their own pictures at the event. 
Larios, an 18-year-old 
women’s studies and sociol-ogy freshman who identifies as lesbian, noticed a trend in the exhibit: like in her own experi-ence, many of the comments in the pictures were said by a fam-ily member.
“Family stops a lot of people 
from coming out,” she said, “because I guess they feel like they did a bad job raising us.”
Faculty and students of all 
backgrounds stopped by to snap pictures. Others struck a discussion about struggles in the LGBTQ community.
Pride’s Internal Vice Presi-
dent Hiram Martinez-Cabrera said the event was modeled after “Project Unbreakable,” a project raising awareness of sexual abuse by victims display-ing the quotes of their attackers. “Weight of Your Words” was the finale to events celebrating Pride History Week.
“It’s important to remember 
where we came from and the pressure we faced being raised,” the 19-year-old UF public rela-tions sophomore said.
Although she identifies as a 
straight female, political science freshman Wendy Serra, 18, sup-ported the event because the students in the pictures caught her attention.
“Being from the Hispanic 
community and hearing these things, it brings what they say to light,” she said. “It doesn’t affect me, but it affects other people.”Coming Out Day 
gallery caps off Pride History Week
About 400 sex offenders are registered in Alachua County
database on the registry’s website. State Sen. Eleanor Sobel (D-
Hollywood) sponsored the bill.
“Sex offenders in our system of higher education are a harsh 
reality,” Sobel said in a statement. “Helping to provide Flor-ida’s students the most efficient tools to identify and inform themselves about potential threats in their lives was a logical next step for me.”
Under the Florida Sexual Predators Act, anyone convicted 
of a sex crime must register with the state. He or she can be classified as either a predator — if convicted on a capital, life or first-degree felony sex offense — or an offender — if convicted on lesser charges. An offender’s name, picture, current address and charges are then made public through the registry’s web-site. Offenders must notify a local sheriff’s office when they move and if they decide to enroll, work or volunteer at a col-lege. The information is passed along to the state and school.
In Alachua County, there are 409 registered sex offenders, 
according to FDLE data. Eleven are between the ages of 18 and 24.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email the univer-
sity supports the database because of its transparency. “This tool provides students, faculty and staff with informa-
tion to help make them more aware of their surroundings,” she said. 
Jennifer Klein, a UF instructor for the “Sex Offenders” class 
in the Department of Sociology and Criminology & Law, said she supports the database but doesn’t think the information will stop parents from sending their children off to college. 
“We’ve been sending kids to schools for years, and sex of-
fenders have been on campus,” she said. “It’s just now you know they are there.”
Jamie Foote, a 22-year-old UF communication sciences and 
disorders junior, said the new database will help keep campus safety a priority. 
“It’s worth it if it means safety for students on campus,” she 
said. RegistR y, from page 1
UF’s ACCENT Speaker’s Bureau declined to host the event
the event was finalized last week.
There had been some confusion over 
who would host the event, but ACCENT  
Speaker’s Bureau chairman Daniel Landes-berg, a 21-year-old UF telecommunication senior, said it would not be hosted by his organization. 
“We get so many great options every year; unfortunately, we can’t bring every single option that is presented to us,” he said. “With Mr. Chomsky, the dates, times and locations just didn’t work well for us.”
Instead, the fees for the event will be 
shouldered by the CMC, Czopek said.
“It’s not so much even the lecture fee,” 
he said. “The main cost for us is the $6,000 we’re paying to rent the Phillips Center.”
The rental fee was paid for by one of the CMC’s supporters and will be repaid through donations from other supporters and community groups, Czopek said.But students said they’re excited about 
the event, regardless of who hosts it. 
Natalie Amgot, a 22-year-old UF French 
and Chinese senior, said her interest in Chomsky began when she read a book about him her freshman year.
“I really like languages, and Noam 
Chomsky is a really big linguist,” she said. “I would really like to be a French linguist and a professor, so he’s been a really great inspiration for me.”

On Tuesday, Turlington Plaza 
will once again become a center for 
controversy. 
Created Equal, a group dedicated 
to starting conversations about abor-tion through the use of graphic pic-tures, will be displaying its exhibit from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The organization has brought the 
exhibit to campus in previous years. For some students, it is notorious for inducing tears or vomit.
The collection includes pictures 
of dismembered fetuses. Madison Bellaire, a 19-year-old 
UF physics and mathematics sopho-more, said she will avoid the area. 
“I have issues with anti-abortion 
campaigns where the main goal is to cause disgust and guilt in others,” she said. “They make it harder on women who are trying to make an important, difficult decision.”
However, Mark Harrington, the 
executive director of Created Equal, said he believes in the medium for making a point. 
He called abortion a contempo-
rary form of ageism, discrimination based on age.
“The biggest arguments will be 
that the preborn aren’t ... self-aware, therefore they’re not persons. That’s simply because they’re younger,” he said. “We’re a country that values equality between race, religion, eth-nicity, sexual orientation, but we’re discriminating against a group of people based on age.”Turlington to host abortion exhibit

In perfect unison with those 
around her, Lauren Eisenschenk 
marched onto the field under the cloudless blue sky. Small puffs of dust rose from the ground with each step. She lifted her mellophone to her lips, and she was ready.
“As soon as you play the first 
notes, all the stress is gone and you know what to do,” the 15-year-old high school freshman said.
Eisenschenk is a member of the 
Gainesville High School Hurricane Marching Band and Guard, which competed Saturday against 16 other high schools from across the state. 
The 18th Annual Southern 
Showcase of Champions March-ing Band Invitational was hosted by the Santa Fe High School Raider Regiment and totaled 5,000 in atten-dance, according to spokeswoman Laurie Brown.
Band selection is based on a first-
come, first-served basis to those qualified by the Florida Bandmas-ters Association, she said.
Every parent and band student 
at Santa Fe has a role in the event, whether it is directing traffic, driv-ing trucks of equipment or handing out water to those who have just performed.
Tracey Ousley and her hus-
band continue to volunteer even after their son graduated two years ago. She said it is some of the most rewarding work they have ever done.
“It’s very much a sense of pride 
for us that these little communities could put on such a nice event that would make people come back,” she said. 
Keith Davidson, an 18-year-old senior at Fernandina Beach High School, said this was his fourth time at the showcase.
“I really like performing in front 
of people and competing is the best part,” he said
Davidson, with his face covered 
in gray and red makeup and latex, said his band director chose a zom-bie apocalypse theme for the band’s performance to keep up with the theatrical style of the competition.
Scoring is based on a numerical 
system. 
Performances are judged in both 
musical and visual categories for placement in the state semifinals. A.D. Nease finished in first place, F.W.

Due to the government 
shutdown, UF has about two 
months until it must begin making tough choices about how to fund federally sup-ported research. 
UF Vice President for Re-
search David Norton sent out a memo to faculty saying that grant and contract work au-thorized by federal sponsors should continue, but the uni-versity will take over funding the work for a period of at least two months.
For those working via fed-
eral grants, the university is equipped and prepared to continue funding its own re-search, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
Last year, the university 
received $640 million in re-search funding, more than half of which was from the federal government. Much of that money, along with mon-ey from previous years, is be-ing spent now, said Joe Kays, director of research commu-nications at UF.
“We have enough money 
in reserve to fund things mov-ing forward for two months,” Kays said.
However, some new re-
search proposals are being put on hold until the federal workers in charge of review-ing the proposals return to work, Kays said.
Most federal employees 
responsible for grant and contract administration will not be working because of the shutdown. Thus, application systems like grants.gov will only accept and store applica-tions, according to the memo. Using the money from recent-ly granted awards is being considered with caution.
“We’re trying not to spend 
money that has not been allo-cated yet,” Kays said.
Another potential impact 
of the shutdown is to slow the process of sending clinical tri-al proposals for consideration by the institutional review board, Kays said.
“From basic science to very 
applied science, everyone is being affected,” Kays said.
There is an extra inconve-
nience for workers employed at closed federal buildings. Such is the case for Christo-pher McCarty, associate pro-fessor in anthropology at UF and a program officer with the National Science Founda-tion.
“Because the NSF is shut 
down, I could go to D.C., but I would have nowhere to go,” McCarty said.
The average student 
shouldn’t see too much of an effect of the shutdown on his or her research because of the plans in place to keep the university moving forward, Orlando said.
“We’re hopeful that things 
will get worked out in Wash-ington so that we can get back to the business of pursuing science,” Kays said. UF to use reserves to 
continue research
“From basic science 
to very applied science, 
everyone is being 
affected.”

He’s reached worldwide fame while preserving 
his anonymity, putting the spotlight on the un-derground street-art scene. 
Banksy is a British grafﬁ  ti artist known for his po-
litically charged, satirical work — which he does incog-nito. 
Silhouette stencils accompanied by witty, but scath-
ing, slogans critical of government and capitalism have shown up in cities all over the world for more than a decade. 
Some of his work has appeared in deliberately con-
troversial spots — from the Berlin Wall to Wall Street to the Israeli-Palestinian border wall. 
Sometimes, however, the grafﬁ  ti shows up in non-
descript places such as a wall of a health clinic or the side of a convenience store. 
It’s like the Mona Lisa being put on display in an 
empty parking lot — fans come ﬂ  ocking to see a “real” Banksy piece.
This month, New Yorkers have been on the lookout 
for the masked muralist and his city-wide project called “Better Out Than In.”
In a hilarious and appropriately anti-establishment 
turn of events, a couple of New Yorkers are turning a buck by charging people for a glimpse of his latest work. 
They covered the illustration — a beaver chewing on 
a broken parking sign — with a cardboard box, alleg-edly charging $20 or the same value in pizza from fans.
Despite not selling his work personally or having 
conventional museum exhibitions, the artist has gained a large following, propelled by his Oscar-nominated documentary “Exit Through the Gift Shop.” 
One of his works, “Bird with a Grenade” was sold 
by a high-end international auctioneer for over $200,000 in 2011. 
So, is $20 a pop really too much to ask? Social media alerts a-la 
“OMG-a-real-Banksy” brought a mob of camera-happy tourists to a tough Brooklyn neighbor-hood it would otherwise never venture into. 
The corner of Bradford and 
Pitkin became an attraction in-stantly, but what do the people 
who live in the neighborhood get out of it? 
Besides media coverage and numerous selﬁ  es on In-
stagram, not much. 
It’s easy to call these guys bamboozling opportunis-
tic nuisances. 
I empathize with you, New York City art lovers. The struggle is real. But the truth is, these guys are business-savvy entre-
preneurs. 
In fact, New York City was built on go-getters who 
made capitalism work to their advantage. 
Banksy would be proud.I would argue they’re not the only ones exploiting 
the opportunity. 
The gentriﬁ  cation of neighborhoods, or the hipsterﬁ  -
cation in this case, can be an exploitation of the people who live there if it has no intention of lifting up the original residents. 
Making a poor neighborhood a center of art and cul-
ture for a new socioeconomic class is an eviction in its own right. 
Obviously, the corner of Bradford and Pitkin isn’t 
going to become the next Greenwich Village overnight.
But it’s important to consider why these hustlers are 
indeed hustling every day.

60% NOMe(rlot) Generation:
Millenials’ extreme 
wine consumption
In May, TIME magazine published a trend piece about mil-
lennials titled “The Me Me Me Generation,” but it failed to mention one interesting characteristic of our often-scold-
ed generation: We’re turning the wine industry over on its head.
According to Fox Business, millenials drink more wine 
than previous generations when they turn 21. Wine distribu-tors and advertisers are noticing, too.
According to a Fox Business article, “’Historically, wine 
has been marketed to older generations and came with a huge pretense,’ said Melissa Saunders, owner of wine importer Communal Brands. ‘But this generation is blowing all of that out of the water. They don’t care about the pretentiousness of a wine, they want something that is authentic and speaks to them. This is a huge marketing opportunity.’”
Millennials, according to Ronan Stafford, a Canadian Wine 
Report analyst, drank 25.7 percent of wine by the volume in 2012 — higher than the global average of 20.6 percent. Con-sumers of wine, however, are still overwhelmingly middle-aged and elderly: 44.1 percent of 2012 wine consumption in the U.S. was by men and women aged 55 and older. 
However, as the article noted, let’s face it: Baby boomers 
are getting old, and they’re not going to live forever. Now that wine producers are noticing the growing popularity of vino among the young folks, market research has been con-ducted to determine buyer trends and ﬁ  gure out how wine suppliers can cater to the changing needs of consumers.
Millennials don’t care about showing off expensive, rare 
vintages to their friends as older people do, Rowan Gorm-ley said, CEO of Naked Wines. Younger wine drinkers place value on the story behind the wine, how it’s packaged, where they found it and the unique blend it’s comprised of or region it’s from. 
“This generation wants to know the story of a wine,” Me-
lissa Saunders, owner of wine importer Communal Brands, told Fox. “You are going to see bottles with generous amounts of information that have a cool design that is authentic and appeals to people so they don’t look like everything else on the shelf.”
Given the proliferation of the extensive and cheap wine 
options available at Trader Joe’s, it doesn’t seem like ground-breaking news: Young people want a bottle of wine that’s low-priced but not cheap-tasting, packaged with a cool label and eco-friendly bottle and has a rich history.
We no longer think of wine as a status symbol. It’s much 
more acceptable to roll up at a BYOB party with a bottle of Two-Buck Chuck than a $100 bottle of Château Montrose cab-ernet sauvignon. And now, more than ever, we have a middle ground: Trader Joe’s wine is neither low-quality boxed drug-store wine nor is it extravagant and overpriced.
For all the knocking that millennials get for being lazy, en-
titled and narcissistic, the spike in wine consumption and the collective desires of younger wine buyers says a lot about the evolution of food culture.

What I am about to say 
might not win me any friends at the  
Alligator, but I must be frank: The current state of American journalism is doing its part to destroy American democracy. 
It sounds like the ranting of 
a raving lunatic, but bear with me. My diatribe might con-vince you. 
The proliferation of web-
based journalism coupled with the desperate need for cable news to instantly report everything — typically with terrible results — to the dy-ing newspaper industry, all are doing their part to spark a ﬂ  ame and watch our beloved experiment in democracy burn to the ground. 
With regards to web-based 
media, almost anyone now has the potential to be a citizen “journalist.” I put journalist in quotes, because let’s be hon-est, how many are reporting news or are simply pushing a half-baked commentary and trying to pass it off as serious journalism?
On the one hand, web-based 
reporting is a great develop-ment, and the almost endless number of blogs do help un-cover stories that conventional journalists don’t have time or the means to cover. 
However, there’s a dark, 
seedy and sinister side to on-line journalism that should shake you to your core. 
Conspiracy theorists like 
Glenn Beck and Alex Jones use the web as a means to distribute their deranged be-liefs to the hardcore believers. Both Beck and Jones use their websites to bloviate endlessly on an array of ridiculous con-spiracy theories masquerading as “news.” 
I’d consider their inane be-
liefs hilarious if no one took them seriously. Sadly, far too many do. 
If the conspiracy theorists 
don’t concern you, then the lack of hard news websites should. 
Scourers of web-based 
news are dealt with an endless stream of ideological websites masquerading as news, but those sites spend most of their time bashing those they don’t like. From Drudge Report and FOX Nation on the right, to the Daily Kos and Talking Points Memo on the left, it’s far too easy to plug your ears, put the blinders on and only receive “news” from one angle. 
Who needs fact-based jour-
nalism when opinion is far more fun?
Rather than hard reporting, CNN, Fox and MSNBC push an array of talking heads yell-ing at viewers, demanding ac-ceptance of their point of view. When they’re too tired to talk, they bring in pundits to push an ideology for them. 
Also — in the midst of a 
breaking news story such as the recent shootings at the Navy Yard or the Boston Bombing — news networks regularly get their facts wrong in a rush to be the ﬁ  rst ones reporting. This happened to NBC and CNN in the immediate after-math of the Navy Yard shoot-ing last month. Both networks incorrectly reported the name of the shooter and quickly had to issue retractions. 
Similar events occurred in 
the aftermath of the Boston Bombing. After the bombs went off and confusion and chaos gripped the streets of the city, networks quickly jumped on a story that a ﬁ  re in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Li-brary and Museum at Harvard University was somehow con-nected to the attacks. 
Newsﬂ  ash! It wasn’t.In a race to be ﬁ  rst, televi-
sion-news networks regularly look like the losers as they trade facts for speed. We all want to receive news as it breaks, but getting the facts wrong does more to hurt the story and our society than it helps. The talk-ing heads look foolish, and we grow dumber and a bit more impatient as a result.  
For the sake of our democ-
racy and our nation’s future, it’s imperative we seek out the truth, not some distorted mon-strosity created to sell ads, pro-mote an ideology or push par-tisan viewpoints to the edge. 
Plenty of great journalists 
are working today and doing their part to tell the truth. Their numbers aren’t dwindling; rather, people aren’t yearning for facts the way they used to. 
It’s time for journalists 
across the country to once again remind the American people why it’s so important not only to have a free press but one that prides itself in tell-ing the unmitigated truth.

How the Internet 
and television news undermine journalismColumn
Joel Mendelson
opinions@alligator.orgThis past Thursday, I attended 
an event hosted by CAMERA and UF Hillel titled “Less 
Hamas, More Hummus.” 
As if the title alone wasn’t ri-
diculous and incredibly offensive to Palestinians, I think the statements by speaker Dr. Anat Berko also bor-dered on insanity. At surface level, her talk appeared to be about the plight of suffering Palestinian wom-en; however, it wasn’t hard for me to see the thinly masked racist Orien-talism hidden behind faux-feminist remarks.
It seems to me that Berko, de-
spite her guise as a “progressive” or even possibly a “feminist,” actually uses the very personal anecdotes of women to justify the massively oppressive actions of Israel. In my opinion, there is nothing progressive about using the struggles of women to promote a disgusting, repressive occupation. I think she undermines their plight and also conveniently leaves out the systematic human rights violations the Israeli Defense Forces carries out against Palestin-ian women every single day.
In protest of her speech, Students 
for Justice in Palestine held a walkout to make it clear our campus doesn’t feel comfortable with what we see as hate speech. Four members of SJP stood up during her talk wear-ing signs that read “Hamas isn’t the problem, Israeli occupation is,” “The IDF kills women and children,” and “Gaza is under siege and blockade.” 
One female member read a short 
statement denouncing the event, and furthermore the overall de-monization of Palestinian culture. In response, Berko completely lost her composure, screaming at the mem-bers and responding with threats. Sadly, this behavior wasn’t surpris-ing to me, as I think  it’s typical of Israeli apologists to respond to any sort of resistance with hysteria and a zero-tolerance policy for any sort of dissent.
As a representative of the Israeli 
occupation, Berko herself helped hammer home the point SJP wanted to bring to light: Israel and its apolo-gists have no room for free thought, resistance or any sort of Palestinian voice. It is not Hamas that occupies the West Bank and Gaza, denies women basic health care or access to hospitals where they can safely give birth to their children, kidnaps Pal-estinian children, divides families, bulldozes homes and shoots teenag-ers in the back for throwing stones at tanks rolling through their neigh-borhoods. 
Ask a Palestinian woman about 
her struggles and she will surely tell you about checkpoints, sons mur-dered by IDF soldiers, the need for electricity and the fact that she has no clean water to survive on. The IDF arrests 500 to 700 Palestinian children per year. Berko’s attempts to place the blame for oppression in Palestine on Palestinians themselves is nothing other than a racist means to solidify Israel’s systemically op-pressive tactics.
There is no excuse for holding 
events like this one, which com-pletely marginalize Palestinian voices and forget that Palestinians are actual human beings. Come on, Bob Graham Center for Public Service: I know you can do better than this. I’ve attended genuinely inspirational and progressive events here. Please, live up to that name, and stop giving a voice to individu-als whose only goal is to ignore the worth of an entire group of people and maintain the status quo.
If you would like to hear voices 
from Palestinians themselves, join Students for Justice in Palestine, and be on the lookout for Palestin-ian People’s Week in the last week of October.

A UF graduate student 
conducted a study for smell 
sensitivity that led to con-firming a diagnosis of early stage Alzheimer’s disease.
Using a teaspoon of pea-
nut butter and a ruler on test subjects, Jennifer Stamps, who studies biomedical sci-ences with a concentration in neuroscience, found that a person’s sense of smell — or lack thereof — can detect Alzheimer’s disease.
Stamps conducted the 
experiment on 24 subjects and found that 10 had an ex-tremely low sense of smell in their left nostril as com-pared to their right.
“There was a difference 
of 12 centimeters between the left and the right nos-tril,” she said. “We realized we had a remarkable find-ing.”
The impairment in the 
left nostril always led to a positive Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. On average, there was a 5 centimeter smell-ing range for the left nostril, which is part of the olfactory nerve. The nerve is stimu-lated by the smell of a pure odorant, like peanut butter.
Stamps’ mentor, Dr. Ken-
neth Heilman, told her if she could come up with some-thing quick and inexpen-sive she could conduct the study.
Other neurological exams 
fail to test sense of smell be-cause it’s time consuming, Stamps said.
“Right now, the peanut 
butter test is good for early diagnostics,” she said. “We still want to research what the impairments mean.”
Reynaldo Calzadilla, a 
20-year-old computer engi-neering sophomore, whose grandfather had Alzheim-er’s disease, said he would opt out of the diagnostic test.
“I just feel like I would 
change my life in a negative way,” Calzadilla said. “It’s good to know that science is advancing and helping peo-ple, but I still wouldn’t want to know.”
Anyone who does the test 
at home should be cautious. 
Stamps said it will only 
work for people who are in the age range of being diag-nosed with Alzheimer’s. 
“If you’re doing this at 
home, please make sure you want to know,” Stamps said. “Don’t freak out if your sense of smell is significant-ly different in both nostrils. Get checked by your doc-tor.” LAWRENCE CHAN

The city of Gainesville has be-
come animated with the opening of 
the Anime Art Museum.
The museum, located at 1155 NW 
13th St., calls itself the first anime-style art museum to open in the U.S. and showcases 17 pieces of art. 
Carmen “CJ” Marrero-Akin, ex-
ecutive director and co-founder of the museum, opened it to the public on Tuesday. 
Along with a permanent art col-
lection on exhibit, the museum will eventually feature art from visiting artists, themed exhibits on the his-tory of anime and a cafe.
“We want to show that anime art 
pieces can be unique and creative in its own right,” Marrero-Akin said.
Marrero-Akin, a UF alumna who 
has been drawing since she was 7, said the goal of the museum is to fos-ter the skills and confidence of aspir-ing anime artists and to celebrate the artistic expressions behind popular franchises.
All but one of the art displays are 
Marrero-Akin’s own work, but the museum is accepting art donations from local and international artists.
Marrero-Akin said she hopes to open the museum to the broader community and eventually spotlight the works from young anime artists.
Robert Witt, the 20-year-old presi-
dent of the Gator Anime Club and an electrical engineering junior, said he hopes to visit the museum and bring the club with him.
“Anime may not be as popular in 
America as modern art,” said Witt. “But it definitely has its fans.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2013

Alachua County Animal Services an-
nounced free cat adoption last week due to a 
surplus of cats and kittens in the shelter. The free adoption period will run until Oct. 31.
The cats come with rabies shots, micro-
chips and are spayed or neutered, said Ver-non Sawyer, Alachua County Animal Services Director. The Animal Services Headquarters, located at 3400 NE 53rd Ave., is open Tuesday through Saturday, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
“The reason for the surplus is not specified, 
but every fall, we do see a pattern for an influx of cats,” said Jessica Lauginiger, interim shel-ter supervisor for the county.
Lauginiger said the shelter has about 70 
healthy cats ready for adoption.
“We usually have one area in our lobby for 
adoptable cats, but right now we have three rooms full of adoptable cats,” she said.  Most of the cats are around 4 months to 6 
months old, she said. There aren’t many new-born kittens because the prime breeding sea-son runs between June and August.“We have a real simple adoption applica-
tion,” Sawyer said. “It takes five to 10 minutes, tops.”
Animal Services has worked with the 
County Commission to allow for free adop-tion under a surplus schedule, Sawyer said. Its goal is to be a no-kill organization by 2015.
Within the past five months, Animal Ser-
vices has allowed for other free adoption op-portunities, Sawyer said, and adoption rates have increased as a result. Alachua County Animal Services offers free felines through Oct. 31

Gainesville Police arrested a man early Sunday after he 
threatened two teenagers for walking on a cow pasture. 
Officers arrested Scott Parker, 32, on charges of aggravated 
assault, child cruelty, false imprisonment and impersonating a 
police officer, according to an arrest report.At about 1 a.m. Sunday, a 15-year-old 
girl and a 17-year-old boy pulled over in the 5500 block of Northwest 34th Street to walk through a cow pasture, GPD spokesman Of-ficer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Parker, who lives across the street, 
walked up to them with a loaded handgun, told them he was a deputy and ordered them to get on the ground. He took their car 
keys while pointing the gun at the boy, Tobias said. 
While the teeenagers were on the ground, Parker walked to a nearby house and told a neighbor he had two people in cus-tody. The neighbor called police, who then arrested Parker.
During questioning, Parker denied owning the handgun. 
However, officers found the handgun under a seat of Parker’s truck. Inside they also discovered a hose connected to the ex-haust pipe, which could imply he had been attempting suicide before the confrontation with the teenagers, Tobias said.
Parker’s children, ages 2, 9 and 22, were home during the 
incident. They told police they heard their father yelling at the teenagers, Tobias said. Officers booked Parker into jail, where he remained Sunday with a $4.5 million bond.Gainesville man arrested after incident in cow pasture“We have a real simple adoption

BATON ROUGE, La. — Kelvin 
Taylor made Florida’s offense look 
alive in Death Valley.
Coming in at the start of the 
second quarter, Taylor made ex-plosive plays other running backs could not.
Taylor was one of the few 
bright spots on offense in No. 17 Florida’s 17-6 loss to No. 10 LSU in Tiger Stadium on Saturday.
“He had a great game,” tail-back Mack Brown said. “He had a great week of practice, so [he got] his opportunity and did the best job he can do.”
Taylor rushed for 52 yards on 
10 carries Saturday and ﬁ  nished 4 net yards behind Brown, who had ﬁ  ve more rushes.
Florida (4-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) needed Taylor and Brown to step up. 
Starting running back Matt 
Jones left the game in the ﬁ  rst quarter with an apparent left knee injury. Before leaving, he ran for 17 yards on four carries.
Muschamp said he did not 
think Jones’ injury was serious, but it kept the sophomore halfback out for the rest of the game. Jones appeared on the sideline later in street clothes.

ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
BATON ROUGE, La. – Francisco Velez previously spent 
Saturdays watching football. 
Not on the sidelines with the rest of the Gators, but at 
home with his family and girlfriend.
The walk-on kicker had not traveled with Florida during 
his three seasons with the team, a span of 44 games and a lot 
more practices.
Velez found out his Saturday plans 
would be changing  Thursday when spe-cial teams coordinator Jeff Choate told him he would make the trip with the team to 
LSU. 
Velez made the most of his college de-
but, booting two ﬁ  eld goals — a 44-yarder in the ﬁ  rst quarter and a 27-yard attempt in the fourth — during No. 17 Florida’s 17-6 loss to No. 10 LSU in front of 92,980 fans at 
Tiger Stadium.
“The ﬁ  rst one, I wasn’t that nervous,” Velez said. “The 
second one, the stadium got a lot louder.”
Velez made the trip instead of senior walk-on kicker Brad 
Phillips. Phillips and redshirt freshman Austin Hardin have each struggled this season, prompting coach Will Muschamp to give Velez an opportunity.
For the Ocala native, the chance of a lifetime was one he 
had almost given up on.
“I was starting to doubt myself, since this is coming to an 
end next year,” Velez said of being given an opportunity. “I just kept thinking positive that I would, and I ﬁ  nally got it.”
It remains unclear how the breakdown of ﬁ  eld-goal at-
tempts will be decided. 
Prior to Saturday’s game, Muschamp indicated Hardin, 
who possesses the strongest leg, would handle kicks from Redshirt junior 
kicker perfect in Florida debutTaylor breaks free against Tigers
PHILIBUSTER
BATON ROUGE, La. — Florida should leave its 17-6 
loss to LSU feeling good about Tyler Murphy and awful about its offense.
Although it seems contradictory, the play of a quar-
terback and the performance of an offense can be mutu-ally exclusive. That was the case Saturday night in Tiger Stadium.
Making just his third start in his fourth career game 
— his ﬁ  rst true test after treating matchups with Tennes-see, Kentucky and Arkansas as nothing more than mere speed bumps — Murphy regressed against LSU in Death Valley.
But that isn’t why Florida lost.Murphy ﬁ  nished the game 15-of-27 passing for 115 
yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. Unlike in previous games, he did not do much damage with his legs either.
In a vacuum, that would sug-
gest a pretty hideous performance. In reality, it was more than Florida could have asked given what Mur-phy endured — three hours and seven minutes of hell.
For as much as the Gators sup-
posedly improved along the offen-
sive line — the additions of Tyler Moore and Max Garcia were expected to help shore up a unit that returned Jon Harrison, Jon Halapio and D.J. Humphries — it looks like they may have gotten worse. The group was putrid against an LSU defense that entered Saturday ninth in the Southeastern Conference with 10 sacks on the season.
Murphy was sacked four times, but that number could have easily been closer to 10 if not for some heady plays and incredible movement in the pocket by the redshirt ju-nior signal-caller.
Facing a second and 2 from the LSU 39-yard line during 
Florida’s opening possession, Murphy was in the clutches of a Tigers defender until he miraculously shoveled a pass to Mack Brown for a gain of a yard.
You can call it luck or poise. I call it Murphy’s Magic. 
And it’s something he did several other times during the game while running for his life.
Since taking over for Jeff Driskel, who suffered a frac-
tured right ﬁ  bula during the ﬁ  rst quarter against Tennes-see, Murphy has been unﬂ  appable. He is completing 66.7 percent of his passes and has thrown ﬁ  ve touchdowns to 
Murphy should be lauded despite offensive meltdown

Following Florida’s 17-6 loss to LSU, where do you think the Gators 
will ﬁ  nish the season in the polls? Vote online at alligatorSports.
org.The Gators burst onto the national scene 
with their run-and-stun philosophy in a 14-6 
win against LSU last season in Ben Hill Grif-ﬁ  n Stadium. Florida ran the ball on 58 of 70 offensive snaps, burning the clock and mov-ing the chains three yards at a time.
Meanwhile, the Tigers managed only 42 
rushing yards on 25 carries against a stout Gators defense that surrendered more than 11 yards during only four of LSU’s 12 drives.With that victory, UF grounded and 
pounded its way into national title conten-tion.
“We’re not soft. No one can call us soft 
now,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said follow-ing that win. 
“If we didn’t have people’s respect, we 
gained it today. We’re a physical team.”
But the Tigers turned the tables on Sat-
urday, racking up 175 yards on 39 carries against a Gators defense that entered the game ranked second nationally in rushing defense.
LSU running back Jeremy Hill spearhead-
ed the outburst by gouging the UF defense for 121 yards on 19 carries, including 64 yards on seven carries in the fourth quarter alone.
Hill became the ﬁ  rst opposing player to 
rush for more than 100 yards against Florida since Georgia running back Todd Gurley tal-lied 118 yards on 27 carries last October.
Backed by Gurley, the Bulldogs ended the 
Gators’ hopes of reaching Atlanta.
“We got beat in the front seven,” junior 
linebacker Michael Taylor said. “They beat us at the line of scrimmage, at the point of at-tack, and that’s how you run the ball. Getting leverage on the other team, beating them at the point of attack, that’s what they did on a lot of plays.”
On the other side of the ball, the Gators 
could not muster enough production in the ground game needed for a balanced attack. Losing sophomore running back Matt Jones to a left knee injury during the ﬁ  rst quarter did not help.
A career day from freshman Kelvin Tay-
lor was a breath of fresh air, but Florida’s season-worst average of 2.8 yards per carry on 40 attempts could not get the job done.
“It was a line-of-scrimmage game,” red-
shirt senior offensive guard Jon Halapio said. “We knew that coming into the game. It re-ally — it was all on the offensive line and the defensive line. We just got outworked, out-played.”
Inconsistency in the running game forced 
the responsibility of production into Mur-phy’s hands, but the struggles on the line of scrimmage bled into the passing game. Deal-ing with constant pressure, Murphy strug-gled in his third career start.
LSU sacked Murphy four times, hurried 
him four times and batted down three passes at the line of scrimmage. Murphy, who was sacked only three times in his ﬁ  rst two starts, was sacked on back-to-back plays to end Florida’s ﬁ  nal drive.
“We’ve got to protect better,” Muschamp 
said. “We had too many free runners at the quarterback. They did a nice job of pressur-ing us. We had too many times that [Mur-phy] had too many guys in his face.”
Halapio blamed poor protection of Mur-
phy on bad communication, poor technique and a failure to pick up blitzes. Crowd noise, he said, was not a factor.
“It was all on us,” Halapio said. “I’m not 
going to sit here and make an excuse. We’ve played in loud stadiums before, and we’ve never folded like that. It’s all on us. We’ve just got to do a better job.”
When he was not taken down in the back-
ﬁ  eld, Murphy threw — a lot.
He attempted a career-high 27 passes, but 
his 115 yards through the air marked his low-est output in four games. Junior punter Kyle Christy, who completed a 14-yard pass on a fake punt play in the fourth quarter, dwarfed Murphy’s 4.3 yards per attempt.
Two of Murphy’s passes were dropped 
interceptions.
“It’s my fault,” Murphy said of struggles 
in the passing game. “I really have to work on getting rid of the ball.”
The Gators just cannot drop the ball. Their 
struggles burned brightest in key moments.
UF lost a yard on eight red-zone snaps, 
none of which came before the fourth quarter. Florida converted only 6 of 17 third downs, including a 2-of-9 clip in the second half.
An overthrown pass to an open Quinton 
Dunbar in the end zone here, two false starts by D.J. Humphries on the Gators’ ﬁ  nal drive there. Each one a roadblock to Atlanta.
“We just got to learn from our mistakes,” 
Halapio said. “Just embrace coaching this week. Get better.”
Next Saturday provides Florida another 
opportunity. The Gators have a chance to not only move on but also keep their Atlanta dream alive. Missouri, which upset Georgia 41-26 on Saturday, gives UF a chance to earn the statement win it failed to make at LSU.
But the margin for error is gone. Each mis-
take is more costly than the last. The season is on the line, and upcoming games against the Tigers and the Bulldogs are critical.
But even though the Gators are backed 
up against the wall, they are not deterred. The road gets bumpier now, but for Florida, it beats making a U-turn and heading back home.
“This is an SEC team, a rivalry team, a 
team that we damn sure wanted to beat,” Taylro said. 
“But they’re not in the East, luckily. We’ve 
got all our East opponents ahead of us. I know we’re capable to beat all of them, so that’s what we’ll have to do.”

Taylor carried Florida to its second scoring drive of the 
day in the fourth quarter.
Tasked with getting the Gators back into the game, 
Taylor rushed for 36 yards on six carries on a drive that ended in a 27-yard Francisco Velez field goal.
“We wanted to get Kelvin some opportunities,” coach 
Will Muschamp said. “He did a nice job.”
But for much of the game, Florida had trouble running 
the ball. The offensive line struggled to open up holes in the LSU (6-1, 3-1 SEC) defensive line. Of the Gators’ 40 runs, 28 went for 5 yards or fewer. UF lost 48 yards on the ground, including 40 yards on sacks. 
“You’ve got to whip blocks and make tackles,” Mus-
champ said. “We didn’t have enough of that happening.”
Right guard Jon Halapio said the offensive line had 
communication issues, which led to LSU defenders get-ting penetration into Florida’s backfield.
Although the running backs’ primary job is to move 
the football, they also had problems setting blocks on pass plays.
“I mean, pass protection (is) hard for everybody,” 
Brown said. 
“It’s kind of hard to pick up. It takes a little bit of 
time.”
Brown was Florida’s leading rusher with 56 yards, but 
he could not break off explosive plays. His longest run was 9 yards. LSU stopped the brunt of Florida’s ground attack within feet of the line of scrimmage, erasing any chance the Gators had at pulling out a victory at Tiger Stadium. 
“We moved the ball,” Muschamp said. “But we gave up 
too many negative plays.”
Added Halapio: “It was a line-of-scrimmage game.”“We knew that coming into the game … We just got 
outworked, outplayed.”just one interception.
For a guy who spent his first 
three years of Gainesville getting as 
much playing time as I did, that’s impressive. It becomes even more remarkable when you look at the help, or lack thereof, that Murphy has received.
For as bad as Florida’s offensive 
line has been, its running game has been equally non-existent for large stretches of time. It is likely there is a correlation between the two.
Matt Jones left during the first 
half against LSU with a knee injury and never returned. Mack Brown again averaged fewer than 4 yards per carry. Only Kelvin Taylor — receiving his first real game snaps of the season — could do any dam-age, and even that was on a limited basis.
With no real running threat and an offensive line that could not hold up long enough for deep routes to develop, Murphy never had a chance Saturday.
Fans will complain about him 
because he is the quarterback, a position that gets too much credit when things are going well and too much blame when they aren’t.
But it’s because of Murphy that 
the Gators still have a chance to win the SEC Eastern Division this season. He just needs some help.the 30-yard line and farther while 
Velez would attempt the rest. 
Afterward, Muschamp tabbed 
Velez, who had not attempted a live field goal since high school, as Florida’s kicker for the time being. 
“He did a fantastic job,” Mus-
champ said. “Frankie Velez will be our kicker right now.”
Punting situation still shaky: 
Junior Kyle Christy had the game of his life last year against LSU. A year later, Florida’s quarterback out-punted him.
Tyler Murphy booted a 36-
yard punt that Florida downed at the LSU 1-yard line in the second quarter. The end-over-end kick looked reminiscent of the three kicks Christy dropped within the 20 against the Tigers last season during the Gators’ 14-6 victory in Gainesville.
Christy, a Ray Guy Award fi-
nalist last season, had two touch-backs and zero punts inside the 20 on Saturday, which was especially displeasing for the UF coaching staff during a game when field po-sition was critical. 
Backup punter Johnny 
Townsend was expected to red-shirt this season but has been men-tioned several times as a replace-ment for the struggling Christy.
“We had opportunities to pin 
them in field position, and we didn’t,” Muschamp said. “Kyle had two opportunities, and he didn’t do it. I’ll open it up. We seri-ously considered during the game taking the redshirt off Townsend.”
Roberson returns at nickel: Ju-
nior cornerback Marcus Roberson saw his first game action since suf-fering a sprained PCL against Mi-ami on Sept. 7. Roberson played exclusively at the nickel position while returning one punt for nega-tive-1 yard. He had one pass break-up and committed a pass interfer-ence penalty in the second quarter that gave LSU a first down.

Although forward DeVon Walker 
has impressed Billy Donovan in prac-
tice, the Florida coach has not ruled out redshirting Walker this season be-cause of UF’s frontcourt depth.
Donovan said he would monitor 
the sophomore’s progress during the next three weeks before deciding if he will have a role in the rotation for the Gators, who could be short-handed at the start of 2013-14 due to the poten-tial absences of Will Yeguete (knee), Eli Carter (leg) and Scottie Wilbekin (suspension). 
The forward would have input on 
the decision, Donovan said. 
But if Walker were to not redshirt, 
Donovan does not want the 6-foot-6 Winter Haven native to assume a lim-ited role like he did during his fresh-man season.
Walker totaled 20 points, 17 re-
bounds and four blocks in 25 contests last year.
“I want to feel comfortable as a 
coach that he’s a legitimate rotational guy,” Donovan said.
“What I don’t want to do is put him in a situation where maybe he plays because of some injuries and things like that earlier on, and when those other guys come back we don’t see him playing a lot. 
“I could see him playing a lot of 
minutes. But I want it to be something that I see that happening throughout the course of the year and not just a stretch.”
Walker was close to leaving UF 
during the offseason. On May 6, Walker announced his intent to trans-fer from Florida. 
But a week later, Walker retracted 
his decision and chose to remain with the Gators. He said his initial desire to transfer was “not primarily” about playing time.
“There were just some misunder-
standings,” Walker said. “Just basi-cally miscommunications. Just small stuff.”
During the offseason, Walker has 
worked on improving his shooting and adding more muscle to his upper body. 
When the lanky Walker did see 
meaningful minutes for the injury-rid-den Gators last season during South-eastern Conference play, he struggled guarding and rebounding against bulkier, more physical forwards. “He’s put in a lot of work,” soph-
omore guard Dillon Graham said. “He’s gotten a lot stronger (and) a lot bigger.”
Although his standing in the rota-
tion remains unknown, Walker is ex-cited to begin his sophomore season. 
 “As far as my role, I’ll just be 
whatever they need me to be,” Walker said. “If I get called on, I’ll just have to make sure that I’m ready to step in to play.” 
Hill getting accustomed: The 
Gators have wrapped up their first weekend of practice, and Donovan is already impressed with the play of freshman Kasey Hill. 
A McDonald’s All-American, Hill 
will begin the season as Florida’s starting point guard while Wilbekin sits out due to an indefinite suspen-sion. 
“It’s really hard because when [a 
freshman is] with a group of veterans, 
those veterans are so much further along in terms of understanding the system,” Donovan said. “But I have not been in a situation where I’ve had to hold back, go a little bit slower. He’s kind of absorbing and picking up ev-erything that we’re putting in so far.”

Katie Mitchell had the best day of her 
career for the No. 21 Florida women’s golf 
team in the final round of the Tar Heel In-vitational in Chapel Hill, N.C., on Sunday.  
Although the Gators dropped one spot 
from the second round and finished eighth in the tournament for the weekend, Mitch-ell (E) turned around an eight-stroke dif-ference from Round 1 to Round 3 as she took the top spot for Florida. “Katie had a great 
tournament and re-bounded well after the first day,”  coach Emily Glaser said. “Today was her first round in the 60s as a Gator, and I am sure there will be many more to come.”
Mitchell, a redshirt sophomore who sat 
out last season after transferring from UCF, shot a 77 and 70, respectively, during the first two rounds before putting together her best performance of the weekend Sun-day. 
Florida finished one spot ahead of its 
ninth-place finish last year at the Tar Heel Invitational but finished 24 strokes behind tournament champion Duke (857, -7). 
Karolina Vlckova (+5) and Maria Tor-
res (+5) dropped five and three strokes, re-spectively, on their scores from the second round and finished tied for 32nd. 
Juniors Sarah Schober and Camilla Hed-berg ended the final round at 7-over and 17-over, respectively.
Florida finished better than four top-25 
teams at the Invitational. 
Glaser believes the team is capable of a 
lot more and wants her team to take this as a learning experience.
“Our finish in this tournament wasn’t 
what we wanted,” Glaser said. “The girls are learning a lot, and assistant coach Jan-ice Olivencia and I are learning a lot about their games.”
