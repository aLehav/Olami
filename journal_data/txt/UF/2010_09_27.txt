Levin College of Law has best bar-exam passage rate in state
When it comes to passing the bar exam, 
UF law graduates were the best in the state 
this summer. 
According to figures released this week 
by the Florida Board of Bar Examiners, 86.8 percent of UF Levin School of Law graduates passed the July bar exam, making UF the best in the state.
Dean Robert H. Jerry said the school’s 
curriculum prepares students to practice throughout the nation and offers students Florida-law-specific classes. About 75 percent of graduates take the bar exam in Florida.
The new rate is an increase from the 81.1 
percent of students who passed February’s exam and a jump from the 64.9 percent pass rate in February 2009, which ranked UF eighth in the state.
 At Florida State University, 86.2 percent 
passed, and 86 percent of University of Mi-ami graduates passed.

A Wildcat ran all over Florida 
Field on Saturday night. 
Fortunately for UF, he was 
wearing orange and blue. 
Florida freshman Trey Burton 
replaced quarterback John Brant-
ley to run on five direct snaps 
against Kentucky and found the end zone all five times. 
The Wildcats had no answer 
for the wildcat quarterback. 
Burton ran for touchdowns 
of 11, 10, nine, three and seven yards, respectively. 
He also completed one pass for 
42 yards and caught an 11-yard 
touchdown pass from Brantley 
— the first receiving touchdown of his career — as No. 7 UF (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) 
beat Kentucky 48-14, giving the 
Gators 24 consecutive victories against the Wildcats and coach Urban Meyer his 100th career win in 118 tries.
Burton’s six-touchdown per -
formance broke Tim Tebow’s record for the most scores in one game by a UF player. Tebow found the end zone five 
times against South Carolina in 2007, the year he won his Heis-man Trophy. 
“It felt like a dream the whole 
night,” Burton said. 
Burton’s effort helped get the 
Gators off to a fast start for the first time this season. 
His first two touchdowns of the game are the only ones UF has scored in the first quarter this season.
Brantley threw for 101 yards 
in the first quarter and finished 
with a career-high 248 passing 
yards. His previous high was 172 against USF. 
The offensive outburst was 
something the team was looking for heading into a matchup with No. 1 Alabama. 
“We got tired of hearing all the 
junk, man,” center Mike Pouncey 
said. “We just wanted to come 
out and prove everybody wrong. [ESPN] had us on upset alert. We wanted to just keep everybody from all the negative stuff, talk about all the positives we got in our program.”
At least for a week, fans will 
do exactly that. 
Wide receiver Andre Debose, 
who failed to record a catch in 
the first three games, hauled in 
four passes for 36 yards in the first quarter.

UF freshman Trey Burton lit up the scoreboard in front of 90,547 in The Swamp on Saturday against Kentucky, scoring six touchdowns (five rushing, one receiving) to break Tim 
Tebow’s school record and help propel the Gators to their best offensive performance of the season.

Journalism students of all breeds — print, radio, tele-
vision and online — have a new playground in Weimer 
Hall.
About 100 faculty, students and guests attended the 
grand opening of the College of Journalism and Commu-
nications’ new 21st Century News Laboratory on Friday afternoon.
John Wright, the dean of the college, said the creation of 
the lab is a response to a changing industry with evolving needs.
It’s important to train people to tell a story in new and 
different ways across multiple, emerging platforms, he said.
UF President Bernie Machen echoed Wright’s senti-
ments, saying the lab will give students a chance to rede-fine the news in an age where the Internet allows for infor -
mation overload.
“From my perspective, it’s really quite a mess,” he said.
Special guests included former dean of the 
college Ralph Lowenstein and CBS News cor -
respondent Sharyl Attkisson.
Attkisson said the lab will be a factor in in-
creasing the college’s profile and a valuable resource for students to emerge from their education prepared for the workforce.
“This will keep them on the cutting edge,” she said.A monument in Lowenstein’s honor was unveiled at the 
ceremony, inscribed with a statement he made in 1976, upon taking the position as dean: “Print on paper is dead.”
Lowenstein spoke briefly, noting how pleased he was 
with the lab and the recognition.
“I am overwhelmed with this honor,” he said.The ceremony concluded with a student-produced pre-
sentation about the Gulf oil spill that demonstrated the 
collaboration students can undertake with shared audio, video and text.
“It was really nerve-wracking to present in front of all 
of these important people,” said Alli Langley, a journalism 
sophomore who participated in the presentation, which took a month to create.
Wright said the lab cost $750,000 to build, most of which 
were federal stimulus dollars.

STUDENT LIFE
By SHANEECE DIXON
Alligator Contributing Writer
There’s another reason to be nervous 
about random roommates.
A recent study by the University of 
Michigan indicates that the freshman 15 
may have more to do with roommate as-signments than with the newfound free-dom of college life. 
Based on the study, freshmen women 
who live with heavier roommates will gain less weight than those who live with roommates of an average weight. Students with heavier roommates 
gained an average of half a pound com-pared to students with slimmer roommates 
who gained an average 2.5 pounds. 
Heavier women are more likely to diet, 
exercise and use dietary supplements 
than average-weight women according 
to Kandice Kapinos, assistant research 
scientist at the UM Institute for Social Re-search. 
“It’s not really the weight of your room-
mate that’s important, but the behaviors 
your roommate engages in,” Kapinos said 
in a press release. “These behaviors are what may really 
be contagious,” she said.
The UM study was the first of its kind 
to assess weight gain us-ing randomized assign-
ments for roommates. 
Students are less en-
couraged to practice 
healthy eating and exer -
cise habits if they have 
roommates who “order 
pizza all the time and 
watch movies all day,” said Kathryn Ross, a UF Public Health and Health Professions graduate student.
“People usually have trips in their be-
havior that add up over time,” Ross said. 
“If you go from eating dessert with one 
meal to eating dessert for three meals, the pounds will add up.”
Ross is currently working on a study 
that examines weight-gain prevention.  The Success through Healthy Eating and Exercise project, or Project SEE, focuses on helping students with maintaining healthy habits in their lifestyles. 
“It’s about self-moderating and keep-
ing an eye on your weight,” Ross said.Freshman weight gain tied to roommates’ eating

After a controversial decision, The Continuum, a grad-
uate student housing development under construction on 
West University Avenue, won’t be built with city bonds. 
The $68 million project will be built on the former site 
of First Baptist Church, at 425 W. University Ave., and will 
contain 400 apartment units for UF graduate students. 
“[Graduate and professional] students really want to 
live and work together. This will provide them with a community that has all the amenities for graduate living,” 
UF Director of Housing Norbert Dunkel said.
UF currently has five apartment complexes exclusively 
for its 15,000 graduate and professional students.

� THE EMPLOYEE, WHO OVERSEES 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE CLASSES, CAME TO WORK IMPAIRED.
By ERIN RAUCH

An Alachua County Jail employee who 
oversees substance abuse classes and Alco-
holics Anonymous meeting was superseded for entering the jail impaired. 
Art Forgey , Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office spokesman, confirmed that Eugene Morris, bureau chief for Inmate Programs, was given two days suspension without pay but declined to comment on the incident.
Morris, who has worked for ASO for 
two-and-a-half years, appeared impaired when he entered the jail on June 13 — a day he had off, according to an administrative 
investigation report.
Sgt. Kimberly Calvin,  the shift com-
mander on June 13, said Morris was slurring 
his speech and staggering as he walked.
Calvin said she noticed the smell of alco-
hol coming from Morris as she stood about five to six feet from him, according to the report.
Calvin drove Morris home in his car 
and instructed him not to drive anymore that day . Although she confirmed his home was just a  “little distance” from the jail, she said his decision showed poor judgment because he could have harmed himself or 
taken someone else’s life by driving under 
the influence.
Officer James Lemmon was on lobby 
duty on June 13 and saw Morris exit his car and walk to the building.
“He was swaying from 
side to side, staggering with a heavy appearance of intoxi-cation,” Lemmon said in the 
report. “I can’t prove it because I never did any kind of test or anything like that.”
Morris said he had two drinks while at 
home, two hours before he arrived at the jail, in an interview with inspectors Karen Love and Ray Swallows on Aug. 4. He could not recall what he had been drinking.
“I think it’s safe to say that I may have 
been impaired,” he said. “I don’t believe 
I was inebriated, but I may have been im-
paired.”Jail employee suspended 
for ironic transgression   Kapinos

NewsLocalFor the sixth time in five years, UF 
President Bernie Machen met with a 
group of city, university and law enforce-ment officials to discuss alcohol policies in Gainesville. 
The group discussed various ways to 
achieve goals of reducing alcohol abuse, underage drinking and their ultimate goal to reduce alcohol-related student deaths on Friday. Ultimately, the group decided it will not introduce any new measures but will continue its efforts to 
crack down on alcohol abuse.
The group has had some tangible 
success so far.  There have been no alco-
hol-related student deaths in more than two years, and the number of underage drinking arrests is down 66 percent since the institution of an ordinance which forced The Swamp and 101 Cantina to temporarily increase their age of admis-sion to 21. 
The campaign to reduce alcohol abuse has not been popular with students, lead-ing to a misconception that the UF presi-dent is anti-alcohol.
“We’re not anti-alcohol,” Machen said. 
“That was one of the misconceptions 
when we started this campaign. The idea 
is to be responsible. Don’t hurt yourself, 
and don’t hurt your fellow man.”
The underage 
drinking ordinance has been perhaps the 
most unpopular part 
of the campaign.  The 
city will be discussing changes in October. 
Machen said he is 
satisfied with the progress made against underage drinking and would oppose any changes. The alcohol discussions were first held in 2005 as a response to alcohol-related student deaths.

Army Lt. Gen. P .K. Keen traveled to 
Haiti for a planned two-day visit in Janu-
ary to meet with officials to prepare for the 
hurricane season, but his trip was inter -
rupted by the earthquake that rocked the country. 
Keen, a three-star general, spoke Friday 
morning at Criser Hall about the U.S. mili-tary joining with the international com-munity in response to the disaster and the chaos that made the crisis response so dif-
ficult.
Keen is second-in-command of the U.S. 
Southern Command in Miami, Fla., and was the commander of the U.S. military 
disaster relief forces in Haiti, called Joint Task Force Haiti. 
He was at the residence of the U.S. am-
bassador to Haiti when the earthquake struck on Jan. 12.
Keen, who received a Master of Arts in 
Latin American Studies from UF in 1986, said the role of the U.S. military was to support and work together with the inter -
national community and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is 
the agency that headed up the U.S. relief 
effort.
“The unity of effort is what we tried to 
achieve from the very beginning,” Keen 
said in his presentation. Keen said the mission of the U.S. mili-
tary in Haiti was to save lives, reduce hu-
man suffering and quicken the relief ef-forts in Haiti.
President Barack Obama’s decision 
to give Haiti the full support of the U.S. 
government and the decision to declassify the whole military operation made it easier for the military to collaborate and 
communicate with the international com-munity, Keen said. 
Before the earthquake, Haiti’s only in-
ternational airport in Port-au-Prince could 
handle about 15 aircraft per day. 
After the U.S. Air Force took control of 
the airport, which was done at the request of the Haitian government, the airport was 
landing about 150 aircraft every day. 
“That wasn’t enough,” Keen said. “We 
probably could’ve landed 500 a day and still not had enough, but that was the most that we could physically put on the ground 
and manage.”
While the majority of U.S. soldiers in 
the relief effort have left Haiti, Keen said 
there are still some there who are continu-ing to assist the international community 
in rebuilding and other humanitarian as-
sistance roles.
“I find there is still great frustration in 
Haiti in various sectors,” Keen said of his 
experience. When he goes back to Haiti, 
though, he does see progress in spite of the immense challenge the country faces in rebuilding. Army general discusses military response in Haiti

Students and alumni gathered 
on the Murphree Area courtyards 
Sunday to enjoy cotton candy, 
sausages, hot dogs, pies, a giant water slide and live performanc-es.
The Murphree Area Council 
held its seventh annual SausageF-est: The Cookout! to raise money for the Boys & Girls Club of Ala-chua County. 
“It’s our biggest program of 
the year, and the reason we’re do-ing it is to carry on the tradition, to help build a community and to unite the past with the pres-
ent,” said Gabriela Redondo, the 
president of the Murphree Area Council.
The event was free and open 
to the public. 
Activity cards purchased by 
Murphree residents covered the cost of the event, and the slide, the “Blue Monster,” was paid for by Student Government. 
Theatre Strike Force, UF’s  im-
provisational comedy group, and the local band Munchees per -
formed.
Dane Gullakson, a senior and 
residential assistant for Sledd Hall, volunteered to barbecue for the event and said he cooked about 300 sausages.
After taking five pies to the 
face, Luis Eduardo Bonilla Riv-eria, a residential assistant, was still enjoying the event.

Alanis Morissette is 
smiling somewhere.
In a clear effort to 
make the next remix of Mor -
issette’s “Irony,” an Alach-ua County Jail employee is making us shake our heads along the way. 
Eugene Morris, a jail 
employee responsible for watching over the substance abuse program and Alcohol-ics Anonymous meetings, spent his day off from jail musing on booze and beer — well, drinking.
And then, for some rea-
son, coming to his place of employment: the jail.
We’re not one to pass 
judgments (we’ll leave that up to you), but we do enjoy a good, solid case of irony. 
A substance abuse coun-
selor and an Alcoholics Anonymous group leader coming to work on his day off drunk and staggering 
with beer-battered breath is 
like a vegetarian being spot-
ted at Sonny’s All-You-Can-
Eat-Pulled-Pork night with 
barbecue sauce dripping 
from his or her lips. 
It’s like seeing Terry 
Jones in Mecca. 
And, luckily, we are one 
to scold. We don’t have a problem with controlled 
enjoyment of alcohol, but 
we do have an issue with a 
man in a position of setting 
an example to current and recovering alcoholics not exactly practicing what he preaches. 
And we do have a few 
questions for Morris, pri-marily why he would come to work on his day off after kicking back a few. 
We just hope, for Morris’ 
sake, he had no black fly in his Chardonnay.Crist isn’t the answer for any voter
For those of you who might have forgotten lately, 
Charlie Crist is, in fact, still the governor of Flor -
ida. 
I can’t really blame you if you did. I mean, he hasn’t done a lot in that position lately 
while he’s been spending most of his time campaigning for senator. 
But hey, the man has got to get a job, right? After all, 
we know he needs the expense account to take his fam-ily to Disney.
It seems Crist wants the Senate job so badly he’s will-
ing to change his opinion hourly to get it. 
If you read my column last week, you know I’m one 
of many who are tired of the pointless fighting between the political parties. 
It is a similar sentiment that is fueling Crist’s Senate 
run.
However, a problem with independents can arise 
when on-the-fence voters don’t know for whom or what they’re voting.
You would think this problem would be easy to over -
come with TV commercials and a website, and in most cases you would be right. 
Unfortunately, it often seems that Crist doesn’t even 
know how he would vote. 
Worse yet, it seems his viewpoints change so regu-
larly that “flip-flopper” doesn’t even describe him any-more.
And we aren’t talking about a politician who has 
held office for  years just changing his mind on a spe-
cific issue. 
On at least three issues, Crist has routinely and pub-
licly flip-flopped with, at most, just months between the statements, and on one occasion, 
the flip happened within hours. 
It has been on Crist’s website 
for months that he is opposed to the health care reform.
However, in an interview on 
Aug. 27, Crist said he would have 
voted for the health care bill if he 
was in the Senate. 
Funny enough, on that same day, his website still 
said he was opposed to it. Talk about sending mixed signals. 
But it got even more twisted when hours later, Crist’s 
camp sent out an official statement saying he would not have voted for the health care bill had he been in Senate at the time. 
Confused yet?He has also flipped his position on the stimulus pack-
age, originally coming out in support and then saying he never thought it was a good idea. 
Crist is trying to make himself seem liberal enough 
to get some Democrat votes while not going too far so he can still get the moderate Republican votes. 
But that’s just it: it is all an act, saying whatever he 
needs to say to get elected and changing his opinion to 
coincide with whatever is popular at the time. 
In a time when we might look to independents or 
moderates who are willing to cross party lines to get 
things done, Crist is still not the answer. 
Sorry, Charlie, looks like you’re just going to have to 
pay your own way to Disney.

Holy Sacrament 
Church sex scandals 
continue to mar religion
As Catholics across the globe hold hands and sigh in 
relief that the latest male-molesting mishap wasn’t one  of their own, Christians are again left with an 
unfortunately misrepresented image of their religious lead-
ers and their questionable habits.  
After four men filed lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct 
last week, the leader of a Georgia megachurch said Sunday 
that he’ll fight the charges and be back in the pulpit soon. 
Maybe Bishop Eddie Long should rejoin the church, which 
held Coretta Scott King’s 2006 funeral, in the pews. 
Maybe a little preaching is just what Long needs. 
We didn’t go through seminary or even take many theol-
ogy classes, but we’re fairly certain seducing teenage men is at least frowned upon in that Jesus guy’s teachings. 
And while preaching in a church where one of Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s daughters also serves as a reverend, we’re ashamed Long used the metaphor of David fighting Goliath 
in which Long compared himself to the former King of the 
Jews.  
Like we said, we’re not religious experts. We don’t fre-
quent the confessional. 
And we  don’t often have cravings for a Eucharist with 
our coffee and crumpets.   
But at least we know the difference between right and 
wrong. 
And we’re ashamed a religion — any religion — that 
preaches love and kindness will again be dragged through 
the mud at the hands of a misguided religious leader.   
We guess it’s too late to ask,“What would Jesus do?”

Letters to the Editor
Senator urges students to end 
corruption
As a student senator, I feel an obligation 
to set the record straight. 
Debate was cut off on two bills by the 
Unite Party last week not because it had become “demeaning,” as was claimed, but rather because some Unite Party senators 
didn’t want to hear about the corruption in 
their own party. They didn’t want to discuss 
why eight different members of the execu-tive branch receive decals paid for by the students that allows them to park wherever 
they want on campus. 
They didn’t want to acknowledge the fact 
that “I Voted” stickers are only a means of 
voter coercion that costs students thousands of dollars a year.  
What Unite senators wanted to do was 
circumvent conversation about why a mem-ber of the Hispanic Student Association blogged his organization’s funding was di-rectly tied to his ability to collect these stick-ers from its members.
They wanted to gloss over the fact that 
last semester an audio recording of a Unite Party meeting confirmed what everyone has known for years — the only purpose of these stickers is to track who has voted in each of the organizations that support the Unite Party.
Tuesday night, Unite senators used the 
immense weight of its supermajority to suf-focate the voices speaking out against a bro-ken system full of corruption and nepotism.
It’s up to every single student of the uni-
versity to make sure this doesn’t happen again.
This week, when you vote in Student 
Government elections, vote to end corrup-tion.

Columnist has misguided views
I can’t believe Bryan Griffin actually 
compared Sharron Angle and Christine O’Donnell to Elizabeth I. 
Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina I get — after all, their net worth is probably close to that of Elizabeth’s.
But it’s quite a leap for the others. Drama and exploration flourished under 
Elizabeth I.
Sarah Palin, Angle, Whitman and 
O’Donnell want to cut or defund the Na-tional Education Association, and the only exploration likely to occur if they are elected will happen off the east coast and at the Arc-tic National Wildlife Refuge.
If these are the women leading the Re-
publican Party — billionaires and beauty queens — I fear for the party’s future and for that of women.
Clay Hughes
UF student
Look out Democrats, it’s time to party like it’s 1994! 
Well, kind of.
Thursday, Republican leadership fronted by 
House Minority Leader John “I-Spray-Tan-Too-Much” Boehner proudly showed off its new shiny toy: “Pledge 
to America.”
Sound familiar? That’s because it is. 
Sixteen years ago before the 1994 midterm elections, 
then Minority Whip Newt Gringrich unveiled the GOP’s “Contract for America,” a plan that is often credited for the Republicans’ bump in the midterms, enabling them to take control of the House.
It’s no surprise the Republicans want to go back to 
the good old days of being the majority party, and this 
“pledge” (though seemingly less binding than a “con-
tract”) is their ticket in.
So what’s in this pledge exactly? It might be easier to 
tell you what’s not.
Though filled with countless talking points about end-
ing government spending, holding on to the Bush tax cuts, boosting national border security, fixing the economy and restoring Americans’ trust in Congress, the pledge has a few gaping holes in comparison to Gingrich’s contract. 
For starters, there is no pledge for a balanced budget amendment. There is no pledge to 
end congressional earmarks.
There is nothing about privatizing 
Social Security, and there is no men-
tion about the two wars we are fighting overseas.
You know, all things the Republicans have talked about 
repeatedly, yet they avoided in their one pledge to show voters what they are all about. 
Honestly, it seems to be a 21-page talking point memo 
with no real teeth. Just a few thoughts about our current system of politics: 
“In a self-governing society, the only bulwark against 
the power of the state is the consent of the governed, and regarding the policies of the current government, the gov-
erned do not consent.”
“An unchecked executive, a compliant legislature, 
and an overreaching judiciary have combined to thwart 
the will of the people and overturn their votes and their values, striking down long-standing laws and institu-tions and scorning the deepest beliefs of the American people.”
“An arrogant and out-of-touch government of self-
appointed elites makes decisions, issues mandates, and 
enacts laws without accepting or requesting the input of the many.”
Where did these quotes come from, you might ask? 
“Pledge to America.” That’s right. The congressional self-
appointed elites making decisions without the input of many called themselves arrogant, self-appointed elites. 
They might have a pledge for us, but here’s a note for 
them: When calling out members of the legislature, it’s better not to be a member of the legislature. You can’t just call the legislature “compliant” and “out-of-touch” like you have nothing to do with the system; you’re in the sys-tem.
Just because you vote “no” on every bill that comes 
through the House does not exclude you from Congress as a whole.
Full disclosure: I am a Republican. I’m willing to give 
John Boehner and his elitist friends the benefit of the doubt until I see if their empty promises turn into concrete votes. But some friendly advice: Don’t underestimate the intelligence of the American voter. 
Just because you pledge to do something does not 
guarantee votes. Try actually proving to people you can do something other than say “no.”
Talk is cheap.

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 2010
Florida eager for 
’Bama rematch
teers, intercepted UK quarterback Mike Hartline 
and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown.
On the Wildcats’ previous drive, linebacker 
Jon Bostic’s interception marked the first turn-over this season by Kentucky.
And the Gators’ defense held the SEC’s sec-
ond-highest scoring offense and second-best 
third-down conversion offense to 14 points and 
5-for-14 on third downs. 
“It gives us a lot of confidence, definitely a 
momentum booster,” Brantley said. “We’re just going to build 
off that. We have to prepare re-
ally hard this week and just build off that.”
Pouncey said the Gators’ 
poor preparation for the Crim-
son Tide before the 2009 SEC Championship Game was the 
main reason they lost to Heisman winner Mark Ingram and Co. 
But this time around, Florida has spent 
months preparing for Alabama. 
“It was a nasty taste last year with the loss, 
and this offseason was dedicated to beating Ala-
bama,” defensive tackle Jaye Howard said. “To 
me, it’s like the biggest game of the year. Who-ever wins this game is set on a smooth-sailing path.”FOOTBALL , from page 1
� THE GATORS PUT JUST 15 OF THEIR 34 SHOTS 
ON GOAL, SCORING FOUR TIMES.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Becky Burleigh envisioned her team starting con-
ference play strong, she just didn’t expect Florida to be 
plagued by the same problems it has had since the begin-
ning of the season. 
Burleigh’s No. 7 Gators (8-1-1, 2-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) opened SEC competition this weekend with two 
decisive road wins, including a 2-0 bullying of Vander -
bilt (4-5-1, 0-1-1 SEC) Sunday afternoon. But much of the postgame talk wasn’t about the win. Rather, the Gators discussed chances squandered.  
“We are doing everything but finishing,” Burleigh 
said. “We held the ball well, looked sharp — everything 
but finishing. At the end of the day, we are 2-0 on the road 
with two shutouts, so it’s hard to really complain about that. But we’re just really pushing this team to be better and better.”
Florida dominated possession this weekend but strug-
gled to make the final touch or finishing pass. On a soggy field in Lexington, Ky., on Friday night, UF beat Kentucky 2-0 but only put seven of 16 shots on goal. 
Sunday afternoon in Nashville, Tenn., the Gators did a 
little better but still put only eight of 18 on frame. “We sound like a broken record talking about it,” cap-
tain McKenzie Barney said. “But we’ve had a lot of op-portunities, we just need to finish our chances. Once we 
get that under our belts, we’re going to be a great and 
unstoppable team.”
Barney, who failed to convert several solid opportu-
nities earlier in the game, scored the goal that broke the Commodores’ back after Vandy surged late. 
In the 79th minute, on a play that Barney said she and 
defender Ashlee Elliott discussed at halftime, Barney 
received a great far-post cross from Elliott and found herself wide open 20 yards from 
goal with Vanderbilt goalie Rachel Bach-
tel charging. Barney took one touch and chipped the ball over the keeper’s head, se-curing a UF victory.
Freshman Taylor Travis gave the Gators 
the lead in the 14th minute by out-hustling Bachtel and cleaning up a loose ball in the box. 
Travis challenged the goalie on a ricochet and drilled 
the deflection into the upper 90 of the right post. 
“The ball bounced down in front of the keeper,” Travis 
said. “We both hit it at the same time and I just popped up a little bit faster than her.” 
Back home this week, Burleigh said her team’s No. 1 
priority is to work on scoring. 
“We really are dominating in every facet of the game 
aside from finishing,” she said. “We have high standards and that’s the one thing that’s missing right now.”UF opens conference play with two 
wins despite finishing troubles

Jeremy 
BrownQB/WR/FB Trey Burton: 5 rushes, 40 yards, 5 TDs; 5 catches, 
37 yards, 1 TD; 1-1, 42 yards passingWith the offense searching for a spark, Burton provided it. The freshman scored all six of UF’s offensive touchdowns to set a new school record, surpassing Tim Tebow’s five-touchdown effort against South Carolina during his 2007 Heisman campaign. Burton
scored five touchdowns at quarterback on read-option plays and another one at fullback, catching a first-quarter pass out of the backfield. His versatility allowed the Gators to plug in a mobile quarterback to run the option, a dynamic the team lacked in their first three wins.
QB John Brantley: 24-35; 248 yards passing, 1 TD, 1 interceptionIt’s weird that two quarterbacks are featured in this week’s version of Swamp Studs, but Brantley earned it. The Ocala native started hot and ended the game with a career-high248 yards. A week after only throwing 23 times, Brantley completed 9 of 12 passes for 101 yards and a touchdown in the first quarter. Before this game, Brantley struggled tostretch the field with his arm. However, he completed six passes that resulted in at least a 15-yard gain against Kentucky.SWAMP STUDS

With him struggling to pick up the offense, 
Meyer moved Debose to outside receiver to 
give him the role of a more traditional pass-catcher. However, Debose was lined up in 
the inside slot on a trips package for each of 
his four catches against Kentucky.
Debose’s first reception came on Florida’s 
opening play, a three-yard out route.
He hauled in his third catch when the 
Gators ran the exact same play to open their second drive. Debose’s second reception came on a screen pass, and his last catch was on an inside drag route.
But Debose disappeared after the open-
ing quarter, never even having another ball thrown his way . 
None of his catches were difficult, but 
they showed Debose can, in fact, be a part of the offense, giving Alabama another player to prepare for this week. 
“It helps my confidence out a lot — know-
ing that I can actually compete and I’m not 
here just to sit on the bench,” Debose said. 
“I’ll build on this and hopefully I’ll get more catches next week.”DEBOSE , from page 15Sports

GATORS IN THE NFL alligatorSports.org TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTMatt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Andre Debose entered Saturday’s game against Kentucky with zero career catches, but 
he caught four passes in the Gators’ first three drives Saturday.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Gators fans entered this season 
expecting Andre Debose to emerge 
as a big-play threat capable of stretching defenses.
In 15 quarters, the redshirt fresh-
man receiver has not flashed much of the promise accompanying his high school hype. But in one quarter, the first quarter against Kentucky ,  Debose became quarterback John Brantley’s most consistent option.
After the first 15 minutes, Debose 
led the Gators with four catches for 
36 yards. Coach Urban Meyer said 
he was impressed with how well the receiver performed in practice last week, and he wanted to reward him by scripting plays for him.
“All you have to do is practice 
well, and Debose will be nonexis-tent next week if he doesn’t practice well,” Meyer said. “You earn your right to get on that field, and he ac-tually earned that right this week in practice doing a great job.”
Meyer said Debose had not been 
involved in previous weeks because 
he struggled to grasp the offense 
during practice.
“It was not be-
cause he wasn’t trying,” he said. “It’s that deer-in-the-headlights look as a fresh-man. You ask him 
to do this, and he makes a mistake. 
‘Do this,’ and he makes a mistake.”

with a hamstring injury, was ex-

Four days after winning their 
19th match in a row against the 
Seminoles, the Gators extended an even longer streak of dominance on Sunday.
This time, conference foe Ole 
Miss was the victim.
No. 3 Florida (10-1, 3-0 South-
eastern Conference) easily took care of Ole Miss (9-4, 3-1) in straight 
sets (25-18, 25-19, 25-19) inside the 
O’Connell Center. 
The Gators have now beaten the 
Rebels 32 times in a row. Out of the 
37 all-time wins Florida has against 
Ole Miss, 32 have been in straight sets.
Despite the lopsided streak, UF 
coach Mary Wise stressed that it was no sure thing her squad would 
come out on top. 
“To beat a team 3-0 that had won 
seven straight (and was) undefeated in the SEC, I think that speaks really well for our production,” Wise said. 
“Probably the best side of the ball was the offense.”
The Gators had only seven at-
tack errors on 85 total attacks, lead-ing to a .388 team hitting average. Ole Miss, on the other hand, had 19 errors on 100 total attacks and hit just .140.
“That’s pretty stellar offense,” 
Wise said. “The numbers were ter -
rific.”
Middle blocker 
Cassandra Ander -
son had her third 
straight match without an attack error, recording seven kills to go 
along with three blocks. 
After hitting .700 on Sunday, 
Anderson is hitting .641 during her 
errorless streak.
Setter Kelly Murphy had six 
kills, 18 assists and 5 digs, ending UF wins 32nd straight 
against Mississippi
SEE VOLLEY, p AGE 16SEE DEBOSE, p AGE 14
It probably struck in the middle of the 
night, some divine inspiration accom-panied by angels and trumpets and a 
voice from on high.
“Your offense doesn’t have to be boring 
and ineffective,” that voice must have said. “It can be diverse. It can score points. It can 
even be fun to watch.”
How else to explain the sudden shift 
in play-calling during Florida’s 48-14 win 
against Kentucky?
Maybe Urban Meyer popped NCAA 
Football 11 into his PlayStation3 and saw all those cool formations his team was sup-posed to be running, or maybe he finally introduced offensive coordinator Steve 
Addazio to some skill players not named 
Jeff Demps and Addazio decided to put his new acquaintances to work.
Whatever it was, it happened just in 
time.
With No. 1 Alabama looming, No. 7 UF 
needed to go from bland to bold in a hurry, and that’s just what it did. After posting season highs in points, yards (466) and en-
tertainment against Kentucky, the Gators 
have finally given the Crimson Tide some-thing to worry about.
It was clear right away that something 
was different about the offense. The first 
play went to redshirt freshman Andre De-
bose, the highly touted receiver who served as little more than a sideline ornament in the first three games.That 14-yard gain 
was followed by a deep incompletion, then a screen to De-bose for seven yards, an option pitch to 
Demps for 17, a deep 
out-route to Deonte Thompson for 20 and an 11-yard touchdown 
run by Trey Burton 
from the wildcat for -
mation.
Six plays and 64 yards in less than two-
and-a-half minutes, and Debose was the 
only player to touch the ball twice.
The show continued on the next drive, 
which again started with a pass to Debose. 
This time, six players carried or caught the 
ball on a 12-play, 85-yard romp.
Not counting running backs lining up 
outside, eight receivers saw the field in 
those two drives, and it looked like the scheme coaches and players hyped up this 
offseason: replacing quality playmakers 
with a large quantity of capable guys.
Saturday wasn’t perfect, as Florida 
rounded out the first half with three punts 
and an interception, but the Gators reached 
the end zone on all four second-half posses-sions and totaled three drives of 80 yards or longer after posting just one in three games.Offense breaks out just in timeDebose

UF’s Cassandra Anderson posted seven kills and three 
blocks in the Gators’ win against Ole Miss.
The biggest question is wheth-
er they’ll keep that look against 
the Crimson Tide or revert to the 
Demps-or-die formula that had 
them ranked No. 11 in the South-eastern Conference for total of-fense through three games.
True, Demps needs the ball. But 
26 carries against Tennessee were too many, and he left this game with a third-quarter foot injury af-ter touching the ball six times in an 
eight-play span.
Why not divert some of that load 
to Debose, third-down-beast-mode 
receiver Carl Moore or the handful 
of other players who looked per -
fectly capable against UK?
Saturday night in The Swamp 
was a sight for sore eyes, but a 
return to the “We just take what 
the defense gives us” attitude — 
a phrase uttered often so far this season — would spell disaster in Tuscaloosa.
The Crimson Tide won’t give 
the Gators anything; they have to take it.
It’s no sure thing that they can, 
but at least they showed they have 
a pulse.MIKE , from page 15Wiggs leads UF’s diverse 
offense with nine kills
her triple-double streak at two 
games. 
However, the Gators did not 
need to rely on Murphy as they were able to spread the offen-sive production around, having five players finish in double-
digits for total attacks.
Opposite hitter Tangerine 
Wiggs had another big game 
for UF, hitting .562 with nine kills. 
She also recorded two digs 
and two blocks, and she was quick to deflect praise to her teammates.
“It’s a lot of the work from 
the people you don’t see, like [Erin Fleming] getting great digs to us, [Kristy Jaeckel] and [Callie Rivers] really work-
ing hard to play defense and 
Murph putting up hittable balls for me,” Wiggs said. “It looks good on paper, but I know that 
it’s definitely a lot of the work 
of other people on our team.” 
On the defensive side of the 
ball, the Gators had a season-low seven total blocks. Rivers led the team with 10 
digs, and Lauren Bledsoe led with four blocks, two areas where Wise felt Florida was lacking.
“Ole Miss is very good 
about using all parts of the court,” Wise said. “The num-bers weren’t as good as we’d like them to be — we left a lot 
of digs out there and maybe 
some blocks.”VOLLEY , from page 15 “It’s a lot of the work from 
the people you don’t see, 
like [Erin Fleming] getting 
great digs to us, [Kristy 
Jaeckel] and [Callie Riv -
ers] really working hard 
to play defense and [Kelly 
Murphy] putting up hit-
table balls for me. It looks 
good on paper, but I know 
that it’s definitely a lot of 
the work of other people 
on our team.”
