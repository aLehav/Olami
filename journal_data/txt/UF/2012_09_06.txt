STUDENT GOVERNMENT
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
Although national parties are 
knee-deep in campaigning, UF’s 
Student Government election 
season is just getting started.
Today is the deadline to regis-
ter a political party for the Oct. 2 
and Oct. 3 elections. The Students 
Party and new Swamp Party have 
already registered.Swamp Party spokesman Sen. 
Daniel Landesberg was elected as a Unite Party senator in the Fall 2011 elections, but he said he felt 
the needs of the Student Body 
were not being addressed.
This is not a name change for 
the Unite Party, he said, but a new party that stands for “fair 
and proper representation of 
constituents and commitment for straightforward, no-nonsense government.”
Students Party President and 
Sen. Ford Dwyer said although 
the new elec-tions codes re-strict campaign-
ing, the process 
of selecting 
qualiﬁ  ed candi-dates is still the same.
“We welcome the best students on campus,” he said.
Fifty new senators will be cho-
sen to represent their constitu-
ents. However, before anyone 
can cast a ballot, prospective can-didates need to qualify for their positions.
Students must meet certain 
qualiﬁ  cations before they can run for Student Senate, and provide documentation of residency for the district they seek to repre-
sent.
During Fall elections, senators 
are elected to represent all of the 
residence halls on campus and 
ﬁ  ve off-campus districts. Proof 
of residency can be in the form of an original copy of a utility bill or Senate candidates to begin process of qualifying for election

Grooveshark launched a mobile-
streaming website Wednesday to bypass 
the Google and Apple app stores after a series of disagreements with media com-panies.
Music-streaming business Groove-
shark, based in Gainesville and founded 
by two former UF students, has had its 
share of roadblocks in the past few years, from pending lawsuits to being booted out of Apple’s app store.
The company lost its Google app 
last week with little public explanation. Android users can download the app through Grooveshark’s website.
Grooveshark announced its new mo-
bile option, html5.grooveshark.com, Wednesday afternoon with little mention of the controversy.
“For the ﬁ  rst time ever, Grooveshark’s 
full feature set is available on any de-vice with a Web browser without being bounded by the limitations of Adobe Flash,” co-founder Sam Tarantino said in a news release.
The company is facing multiple law-
suits from big names in the music indus-try. Universal Music Group sued Groove-shark’s parent company, Escape Media Group, in 2010 for illegally reproducing and distributing songs from Universal’s pre-1972 catalog, according to Alligator 
archives.
It was sued again by Universal Music 
Group in 2011 for copyright infringe-ment.
The Grooveshark app was taken out 
of both the Apple and Google app stores 
last year. The company’s Apple app has yet to reappear, although Grooveshark’s website gives instructions how to down-load the iPhone app if the phone is jail-broken.
Grooveshark spokeswoman Danika 
Azzarelli said the company is working with Google to get its app back on the Android market.
“Grooveshark as an app is not a copy-
right infringement, and Google should 
recognize through their experience with

While many students are 
celebrating the long-awaited 
disbursement of ﬁ  nancial aid, others are just excited they can start paying less for tuition.
A federal judge ruled 
Friday that Florida’s public universities can no longer charge out-of-state tuition to children of undocumented 
workers living in Florida. 
Although decided in Miami, this move excited civil rights advocates and immigration activists all across the state.
UF economics senior Vic-
tor Yengle said he’s ecstatic. 
The 23-year-old moved from 
Peru to the U.S. at about age 
12 and has been following the case. He said he wasn’t 
surprised by the ruling.
“We knew that it was 
unconstitutional because it 
was discriminating against American citizens whose parents happen to be undoc-umented workers,” Yengle 
said. “It was quite appalling 
that this was the case and that ofﬁ  cials were siding with that.”
U.S. District Judge K. 
Michael Moore cited in his 
opinion for the case the 14th 
Amendment, which guar-
antees U.S. citizens equal 
protection under the law. 
Denying in-state tuition to 
U.S.-born children of illegal 
immigrants would violate 
that, he wrote.Judge rules on tuition

He wrote students who have 
lived in Florida as citizens for a 
year or more should be treated as 
such  — regardless of their parents’ 
actions.
When students apply to UF, 
they’re not directly asked if their 
parents are U.S. citizens, said 
spokesman Steve Orlando.
“We would have no way of 
knowing if these students have 
parents who are in the country ille-
gally,” he said.
Orlando said he didn’t know 
how many UF students the ruling will impact or how much the tuition 
changes could cost the university.
UF students who live in-state 
pay about $205 per credit hour, but for non-residents, the rate is about 
$947, according to the State Univer -
sity System of Florida’s website.
Yengle, who is also president 
CHISPAS, said the next step is offer -
ing in-state rates to those who were 
brought to the U.S. as children.
“This is only the first step in the 
right direction,” he said.
Joan Flocks, director of the Levin 
College of Law Center for Govern-
mental Responsibility’s Social Pol-icy Division, said making college education more financially acces-sible to these students was the right 
decision.
“I’m not sure why the state 
would try to pass a policy like this because it would punish the state 
more than the individual,” Flocks 
said.

visor of Elections Stephen Davis informed everyone of election 
codes, including the proper way 
to register a political advertise-ment and where and when cam-paigning can take place.
Campaigning, which is the intentional action of supporting or opposing a candidate or party, starts Sept. 27.
Davis reminded everyone at 
the meeting to campaign fairly and ethically.

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Tuesday morning after he tried to hit 
a woman with his car.
Gainesville Police arrested David 
Leonard Williams, 40, and charged him with aggravated and simple as-sault, according to a GPD arrest re-port.
At about 10 a.m. Tuesday, Wil-
liams and Jennifer Byrd stood argu-ing on the road at Paradise Trailer 
Court, at 4546 NW 13th St.
After the dispute, Williams got into 
his car and drove off. A few moments 
later, he turned around, pointed his car at Byrd, 33, and slammed on the accelerator, but he did not hit her.
Williams got out of his car and 
started arguing with Byrd again. This time, he tried to punch her in the 
face.
Byrd was not injured during ei-ther argument.
Williams left the property before 
an officer arrived at the scene, but po-
lice found him at Oak Ridge Apart-ments, 1120 NW 45th Ave., and ar -
rested him at 11:22 a.m.
“I didn’t try to hit nobody with 
my vehicle,” Williams said to police 
before they ques-tioned him, accord-ing to the report.
Williams also 
said he had mental health problems and that Byrd and another man 
egged him on.
“I just got 
frustrated,” he said. “I was driving 
through the crazy.”
Police booked Williams into Ala-
chua County Jail at 11:41 a.m. Tues-day with a bond set at $12,000.

Community college students 
in Miami have a chance to earn 
microbiology degrees from UF without the six-hour drive.
The National Science Foun-
dation’s undergraduate educa-tion division awarded to UF and Miami Dade College last month a $1.7 million grant to increase the number of students graduat-ing with degrees in science, tech-nology, engineering and math.
The foundation is looking for 
innovative ways to bring com-
munity college students, partic-
ularly minorities, to bigger uni-versities for life science degrees, said grant writer Eric Triplett, chairman of the UF College of Agricultural and Life Sciences’ microbiology and cell science department.“[The foundation is] will-
ing for people to take risks,” he said.
The grant will expand the 
distance-learning program UF and Miami Dade faculty launched last Fall. Miami Dade 
is a full partner in the program, 
Triplett said.
Miami Dade students who 
earn an associate of arts degree there and get minimum grades in certain prerequisite courses are eligible for the program.
Almost all the microbiol-
ogy courses are available online, 
Triplett said. Miami Dade stu-
dents can also attend shortened lab sessions on UF’s campus.
The five-year grant will fund 
20 $1,250 scholarships each se-mester for students at Miami Dade, Triplett said. About 10 research stipends at UF labs throughout South Florida will also be available.
The grant will also provide 
career workshops to educate students about job options after graduating with a microbiology degree.
“There’s more to life than 
medical school,” Triplett said.
The program is based at Mi-
ami Dade’s north campus, where the Student Body is largely His-panic or African-American.
The students often have fi-
nancial concerns and families they can’t leave behind, said grant co-writer Jennifer Drew, 
an instructor in UF’s microbiol-
ogy and cell department. This program gives them the chance to earn degrees from UF without having to physically relocate.
“Community college stu-
dents are diverse to begin with, so they’re not necessarily 18- to 22-year-olds,” Drew said.

� FLACO’S NEW CATERING SERVICE 
HAS ADDED TO ITS SUCCESS. 
ALEX CATALANO
Alligator Staff Writer
When Flaco’s Cuban Bakery opened its sec-
ond location in busy Midtown, staff expected 
business to continue booming.
But quiet summer months hurt both Flaco’s 
Midtown location and its original downtown location. Owner Sara Puyana said business 
has recently returned to normal.
The new branch was supposed to boost 
Flaco’s proﬁ  ts, but Puyana said the downtown location had to support the Midtown location ﬁ  nancially during the sleepy summer.
“We deﬁ  nitely feel the difference,” she said 
of the Fall semester. “Our weekends are get-ting back to normal, and lunch rush is getting 
a lot better.”
The new branch survived with help from 
the original downtown location’s community base — returning customers like homeowners 
from the Duckpond Neighborhood area, city business owners and downtown workers.Toward the end of the summer, Gaines-
ville’s nightlife brought weekend business to the new location. Patronage picked up even 
more when Flaco’s newly created catering ser-
vice started serving student organizations’ on-campus meetings.
But she said there’s still a lot of work to do.Setbacks like broken air conditioners in 
both locations make operating a customer-
service-based business tough.
But as the Fall semester picks up, more 
funds are becoming available to make ﬁ  xes and improvements.
Heather Rivers, a 22-year-old environmen-
tal engineering senior, said the Midtown loca-tion is a convenient place to hang out.
“There’s always people here, especially late 
at night,” she said. “It’s a good place to soak up all the alcohol.”
New features to Flaco’s will include a walk-
up service window with an awning to shield from rain or especially sunny skies.
Jonathan Hamilton, a UF economics profes-
sor, described a similar struggle with the Bur-rito Bros. Taco Co. when it opened an unsuc-
cessful branch in Tampa. He said a branch’s success relies on the staff’s ability to keep the quality of the second location as good as the 
original.
“It can be tough to reproduce the same product with the same quality,” he said.

After a shooting Tuesday night, Gainesville 
Police are looking for the gunman who shot a 
man in the face during an apparent drug deal in northeast Gainesville.
A GPD news release gave the following ac-
count:
At about 9:40 p.m., John M. Stewart and a 
female friend drove to Fair View Apartments, 1615 NE 16th Ave., to meet a drug dealer.
Stewart, 45, had $2,000 in cash and planned 
to buy Roxicodones to sell.
Stewart and the woman met Clyde Byrd III 
at the entrance of the complex.
Byrd, 23, got into the car, told them to park 
behind Apartment No. 17 and made a call from his cellphone, saying, “We’re here.” He then got out of the car and left to an unknown location.
When Stewart got out of the car, a second 
man, wearing dark clothes and a bandana, came out from the woods and tried to rob Stew-art at gunpoint. 
The men struggled, and the masked assail-
ant shot Stewart in the face. The bullet entered 
his cheek, broke some of his teeth and exited his 
open mouth.
The shooter grabbed Stewart’s wallet, which 
had a small amount of money , and ran back into the woods. The $2,000 was in the car.
Stewart’s female friend called 911 and drove 
Stewart to Shands at UF. The two were uncoop-erative to medical staff and ofﬁ  cers.
An hour and half after the incident, the 
woman told police her version of what hap-pened.
Police investigated the crime scene and 
found blood, keys, change and a .22-caliber shell casing. Residents told ofﬁ  cers they didn’t 
hear or see anything during the time of the incident.
The shooter remained 
at large, but police arrested Byrd on Wednesday after-noon. He is accused of a con-nection to the shooting and 
was charged with armed 
robbery , GPD spokeswoman Cpl. Angelina Valuri said.
Although Byrd was not the shooter, police 
are looking for the gunman, who is “wanted for armed robbery and attempted murder, and is considered to be armed and dangerous,” she said.
Police booked Byrd into Alachua County 
Jail at 6:41 p.m. Wednesday. His bond has not been set.

al community college competition Wednesday morning.
The Aspen Prize for Community 
Excellence is awarded to one college from a pool of about 1,000 community colleges nationwide. The colleges are assessed based on learning outcome, degree completion, labor market suc-cess and minority student success, said Rachel Roth, program manager of the Aspen College Excellence Program.
The program will announce the  No. 
1 community college in March. The $1 million prize is split between the win-ner and four additional ﬁ  nalists, Roth said.
The news, along with the fact the 
school was even in the running, was kept a secret from many Santa Fe stu-dents until the ofﬁ  cial announcement. 
“Although there were hints being 
dropped, I was not expecting to hear that announcement this morning,” said SFC Student Body Vice President Amin Ahmadzadeh, 19.
He said he is not surprised that Santa 
Fe College made the list. He attributes the college’s success to the faculty and administration, who he says put amaz-ing effort into their work every day.
Roth said 120 schools were invited 
to apply. The 96 schools that submitted applications were assessed by a selec-tion committee, which chose the top 10 ﬁ  nalists based on performance, im-
provement and equity, she said.
SFC sophomore Lisa Walker, 19, said 
the announcement made her proud to 
be part of the Santa Fe community.
“It gave me more motivation to im-
prove the school even more than what it has already,” said Walker, who is also SFC student government director of community events.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely a good day to be part 
of Santa Fe College,” Ahmadzadeh 
said.Santa Fe College in the

Food stamp recipients 
at an all-time high
More and more people are on food stamps, whether or 
not it’s by choice.
Are we in danger of becoming complacent with 
this? That probably depends on if you view the program as a problem.
About 15 percent of all Americans are on food stamps; that’s 
about 46 million people.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps about 
22.4 million households, which is an all-time high, at a monthly budget of about $132.96 per person.
The program expanded in 2002 under President George W. 
Bush, in 2008 under the newly elected President Barack Obama and in 2009 as a part of Obama’s stimulus package. If you ask the conservatives, the statistics only prove a failed presidency.
News of how many people are on food stamps comes with 
the highest national debt ever recorded: $16 trillion.
“That these two frightening records should be set at the same 
time under Barack Obama should come as no surprise – it is what he wants,” according to the website “ConservativeHQ.”
To be fair, the ConservativeHQ website also stated that “the 
Obama Kool-Aid drinkers at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called (Newt Gingrich’s) state-ments ‘inaccurate’ and ‘divisive,’” so take its opinion with a 
grain of racist salt.
Vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has proposed cutting 
the food stamp budget by $134 billion over 10 years.
“We don’t want to turn the safety net into a hammock that 
lulls able-bodied people into lives of dependency and compla-
cency , that drains them of their will and their incentive to make the most of their lives,” Ryan said, according to CNNMoney.
He would cut funding of a program that helps people get a 
basic necessity, helps the 8 percent of recipients who are elderly 
and helps its 47 percent of child participants.
Has government spending coincided with the national debt 
to force hardworking Americans to go on food stamps?
According to NBC News, liberal commentator Alan Colmes 
said in a piece in the Wall Street Journal, that people “‘only stay 
on it an average of nine months and circulate $1.73 back into the economy for each food stamp dollar spent.”
Colmes’ point of view makes SNAP seem like a positive ex-
perience, like it’s helping our country get back on its feet with a 
quick turnaround of participants.
So, which is it? A government handout that lets people feel 
too comfortable in their “welfare” status or a helpful form of as-
sistance to those who need it?
It’s hard enough to buy healthy food these days.Organic food costs about 800 percent more than it did in 
1997; not saying that organic food is the best food out there, but it’s a good measuring stick to see how much your money, or food stamps, will get you.
So maybe the biggest difference in the food stamp debate 
comes down to who uses them. If people in SNAP tend to cycle 
back out of it after less than a year, that doesn’t seem like much 
of a hammock to us.Gift of a smile more important than style
As a young lady, I would hate to add up all of the 
hours I spend on my hair. Washing, condition-ing, blow-drying, straightening and styling con-
sumes a large amount of time, day in and day out.  
Yet women and men alike take great strides to en-
sure their hair is perfect. 
A bad hair day is a terrible nightmare, but a great 
hair day instills conﬁ  dence.
Styles change with the seasons. If only the fashion 
world would glorify straight and curly hair at the same time, then we all might be at ease.
Women spend hundreds of dollars every year to 
change hair color, texture and length. I go through countless bottles of products and will throw my money at anything that promises a sleeker look.
Hair is a prized possession.
But what would it take for women to give up all of 
their hair?
What if it made a critically ill child happy?
Several organizations accept natural human hair do-
nations and use them to make wigs for children who 
undergo chemotherapy. 
Children receive the wigs for a small fee or for free, 
depending on their ﬁ  nancial needs. The recipients gain 
the conﬁ  dence of a good hair day and, in a way, have 
their childhood given back to them.
The charities Locks of Love, Wigs for Kids, Pantene 
Beautiful Lengths and Angel Hair Foundation all pro-
vide wigs for children battling cancer and other diseas-es that often result in hair loss.
Many hair salons will help with hair donation. At the 
donation site, hair must be clean, dry and kept off the ﬂ  oor.
Colored and permed hair are accepted by some of 
the charities. 
At half an inch a month, it takes about a year and 
eight months to grow the minimum 10 inches of hair required  to donate to most of the charities.
I shook off my nerves, and 
made an appointment to cut off 
10 inches of my hair. 
Never having had hair 
shorter than shoulder-length, I 
underwent this drastic change knowing that my hair meant 
nothing compared to a child’s 
smile.
I took a deep breath when I sat down in the cushy 
salon chair and watched as the stylist undid the bun on top of my head. 
I knew it would be months before I could wear it like 
that again. Then, she separated and secured my hair 
into pigtails.
While still occupied with small talk, the stylist took 
her sharp shears and began to cut away the hair just under my ear. 
I felt the weight of my hair vanish and could hardly 
bring myself to look in the mirror.
She made her way to the other pigtail. I closed my 
eyes and tried to imagine what I looked like. 
Moments earlier, I could have run my ﬁ  ngers through 
my hair down to my waist. 
Now, it ended halfway down the nape of my neck.
In the moments after the ﬁ  nal snip, I was in shock.
Then, I felt purely excited.I was able to make a difference in a courageous 
child’s life using something I already had.
It doesn’t take a big commitment to be a hero.People often think only the biggest contributions are 
meaningful, but it’s the small offerings that add up to the greatest impacts.

The latest model of the iPhone comes out Sept. 
12, and as consumers upgrade their phones, they will downgrade their values in American 
capitalism.
As if anticipating its new toy on the market, Apple 
Inc. successfully sued Samsung Electronics in late August for rights on intellectual property. The case 
ended with a verdict awarding more than $1 billion 
to Apple from Samsung.
While some of the patents could arguably belong 
to Apple, such as mechanics that operate a slide lock for the screen, Apple really just wanted a monopoly 
on smartphones.  
By getting that monopoly, Apple took away the 
option of an alternate smartphone, and with it, 
American capitalism.
The bogus claims of “theft” included accusations 
that Samsung stole the basic shape of a smartphone. It seems like Apple owns the rectangle with rounded edges — while it is at it, Apple should also sue the makers of credit cards, playing cards and driver’s 
licenses.
Normally, a corporation stealing proﬁ  ts via com-
plicated legal strategy is no big deal, but now it di-
rectly affects almost every consumer in America.
In an increasingly digital 
age, normal cellphones no 
longer cut it.
For many consumers, a 
cellphone must be have email and Internet capabili-ties in addition to texting and calls. 
A smartphone must help you manage your life.With the latest verdict in technology, Apple will 
now manage your life with its new monopoly.
Maybe it is technological karma biting those of us 
who prefer PCs to Macs, Android to Apple and ge-neric MP3 players to iPods, but now every consumer is at risk.
With Samsung — Apple’s only real competitor in 
the slim market of smartphones and tablets — out of the picture, Apple could be free to do, or charge, whatever it wants for the only comparable smart-
phone in stores.
Capitalism has always been a champion in Amer-
ica, encouraging competition that can produce suc-
cessful companies like Samsung and even Apple.
A key factor for capitalism to work properly, how-
ever, is that consumers have the option of what to buy.
The verdict of the courts has now taken that op-
tion away from consumers.
Perhaps Apple can claim justice in the legal sys-
tem, but the implications of the ruling will deeply hurt American consumerism.
This victory for Apple will set a precedent, allow-
ing companies to sue about any basic advances in 
technology just to get the upper hand in that mar-
ket.
By taking out its biggest, and only, competitor, 
Apple can charge exorbitant rates for the only smart-
phone that now holds an iron grip on its buyers.

Speaking OutMany Democrats looked forward to ﬁ  rst lady 
Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday. Her perfor-
mance was a genuine yet expected testament to her hus-band’s character.
For me, the most touching moment was a video 
tribute to Sen. Ted Kennedy, who had taken part in the 
Democratic National Convention since 1960, and who is 
still regarded as a revered icon in the party.  
The seven-minute video highlights Kennedy’s major 
legislative achievements, his championship of universal health care and his mentorship/endorsement of then-
presidential candidate Barack Obama.
But the former “Lion of the Senate” had one last 
roar.
The video included clips of Kennedy debating, and 
ﬁ  guratively wiping the ﬂ  oor, with Mitt Romney when 
the latter challenged the incumbent Massachusetts sen-ator in 1994.
The clips start with Romney, who stated that day 
what he then thought about the abortion issue: “I be-
lieve that abortion should be safe and legal in this coun-
try ... ”
Kennedy jabbed back with artful ruthlessness, “I am 
pro-choice. My opponent is multiple-choice.”
The former senator continued to assault Romney’s po-
litical convictions in another clip, saying of the wealthy businessman, “Now he’s for family leave. Now he looks like he’s for minimum wage. Now he’s for education reform.  If we give him two more weeks, he might even 
vote for me, because those are the things I am for.” 
There are two things that we can be absolutely cer-
tain of:
First, the Republican or conservative talking heads 
and political commentators will be enraged about the 
use of a dead senator to bluntly call out Romney.  
Second, this is exactly what Kennedy would have 
wanted; he would have loved every minute of it.
Conservatives’ real objections to revisiting that 
campaign are not due to the ghosts of Kennedy’s past. Rather, such trips invoke the apparitions of the many different Mitt Romneys who have come and gone over the years.
What keeps them up late at night are the ghosts of 
every diverse position Romney has taken on many of the major issues of the day.
Pro-abortion rights Romney, pro-gun-control Rom-
ney, pro-gay-rights Romney, pro-individually-mandat-ed-health-care Romney, pro-letting-the-auto-industry-fail Romney, anti-Reagan/Bush 
Romney and pro-stimulus-and-
bailout Romney are some of the classics.
Although viewing all of 
Romney’s faces leads to specu-lation about his core beliefs and 
motivations for seeking ofﬁ  ce, it reveals something more important.
Republican leaders’ urgency to embrace a man who 
has shown poor commitment to their most deﬁ  ning val-ues is in line with the spirit of their own rightward shift since the president took ofﬁ  ce.  
They are too willing to adopt any ideology that in-
creases their contrast with Obama. Policy positions that the Republican Party endorsed in the not-too-recent his-tory are labeled Marxist when Obama touts them.  
Today’s Republicans have been working diligently to 
rewrite history throughout this administration, from the 
role their prized unregulated markets played in crash-
ing the economy, to a total amnesia concerning the eight years of the Bush administration.
The GOP has put forward a lot of talk about how 
Obama has not done enough to prevent an increasingly stagnant recovery, while simultaneously blocking his jobs legislation during the last two years.
They say the president is too ideological and unwill-
ing to work with them as they take pledges to never 
raise taxes.
The GOP claims the deﬁ  cit should be our top concern 
when its safety-net-slashing budget funds additional 
tax breaks for the rich.
Our country entered into the worst economic slump 
since the Great Depression, and countless people lost their quality of life through no fault of their own.  
Many Americans are still deciding whom to trust to 
lead this nation with conviction. The themes struck at 
the party conventions may play a role in framing that 
decision.  
Perhaps the Kennedy tribute’s most valuable impact 
will prove to be that it reminded us what Mitt Romney, 
today’s GOP and ghosts have in common:
They all exist only in fantasy.

Years ago, when I was a tone-
deaf musician, what I hated more 
than anything was the question: 
Who do you sound like? Pan-
icked, I would flip back and forth between bands in my head, and list who I borrowed from: guitars 
this, lyrics that, keyboards this. 
When people expressed further confusion, I said defensive and overblown things like, “Sound is a concept, man.”     
When I asked this question to 
local troupe Chick-fil-atio, bass-ist Bryan McCauley only laughed and said, “The B-52s beating up a 
clown on cocaine on a surfboard 
— with female vocals.”
For those of you who missed 
it, Chick-fil-atio performed this past weekend as the fourth act of 
Boca Fiesta’s Frankenstein-esque 
sound experiment, Band Rou-lette. The concept differs from its Russian counterpart in that no guns are involved, and no one is harmed physically — only men-
tally and emotionally via demo-
cratic elimination.
The idea: Local musicians 
drop their names and phone 
numbers into instrument-specific 
hats — guitars, drums, bass and vocals — after which they wait for a phone call to learn who they will be in a band with. They have 
three weeks to write three songs 
with three strangers, including at least one cover and one original, to compete against eight other 
bands for the grand prize: a free 
bottle of liquor for each (of-age) musician.
Before the show, I was put in 
touch with Rick McCauley, the 
drummer of Chick-fil-atio, who 
was kind enough to invite me to a practice. This afforded me the op-portunity to ask what Band Rou-
lette meant for local musicians 
and Gainesville’s music scene. The mishmash included Amanda Gonzales on vocals (picture Betty Page with glasses and a ponytail), 
Jacob Adams on guitar, who, with 
his giant frame, made his Fender look almost miniature, and Bryan and Rick McCauley, who are iden-
tical twins save for their haircuts. 
After asking how the brothers were drawn together, Gonzales explained, “Originally the person 
we got picked with in the draw 
dropped out. And Bryan plays bass, and he was around, so ....”
“He was just sitting there 
drinking,” Rick McCauley inter -
jected, laughing. “And he’d al-ready run through practice, so he just played with us.”
The band said it decided to 
participate in Band Roulette not only because the event promoted a good time, but because of the sense of community local music 
provides.
“I think it’s a positive, unify-
ing thing for Gainesville,” Gon-
zales said, “because if it was any-body’s first time being in a band, 
like, this is their opportunity to 
try this. And they don’t have to go out of their way to find all these people.”
“I’ve been in Gainesville for 
over ten years,” Adams said. “So I’ve seen these guys around. I knew a lot of people they knew, and when [Rick and I] met up 
at Boca Fiesta the day after the 
drawing to get acquainted over beers, we both recognized each other and were like ....”
“Oh yeah,” Rick McCauley 
jumped in. “I’ve seen you around before.”
 “I’m just glad it’s changing 
the sound of music. It’s such a positive thing for this town,” he said. “The sound has become all 
the same. And the Gainesville 
sound is amazing — it’s a great, recognizable sound — but this could open doors for a whole 
new kind of music.”
On Saturday, the night of the 
show, I found the band scattered 
around Boca, anxiously waiting its turn to perform. “I’m excited 
and nervous,” Adams said, tight-
ly gripping his beer. “We put in a two-hour practice today.”
Rick McCauley, who works at 
a T-shirt company, printed doz-ens of shirts with the familiar Chick-fil-A logo on them, altered to say Chick-fil-atio. 
“We’re going to throw the 
shirts out during the middle of our set,” Bryan McCauley said. “We’ve got a whole gimmick planned.”
The band’s performance in-
cited righteous cheers, accompa-nied by Adams’ sing-a-long lyr -
ics squealed by Gonzales, “Drink, smoke, fight, curse, slap an a** 
and yell out f**k!” 
However, despite the band’s 
energy and chemistry, first place, 
and the liquor, went to the band 
Uncles. When asked how he felt 
about it, Rick McCauley had this to say: “It was still a blast.”

The most important meal of the day just 
became essential because September is Na-
tional Breakfast Month. In Gainesville, we 
have a wide variety of breakfast joints to 
take advantage of. To celebrate this won-derful month, here’s our list of the top five restaurants that are bacon up the most 
egg-cellent morning meals:
Peach Valley Café [3275 SW 34th 
St.] – With a wholesome environment that 
translates directly to the food, this is the 
perfect place to take visiting parents. Start 
with an order of Apple Fritters ($4), which 
are served with a yogurt dipping sauce and shaken up in a brown paper bag full of sugar and cinnamon before you devour 
them.  After, go for an order of Buttermilk 
Drop Biscuits in Sausage Gravy ($4.90) or a Philly Steak and Egg Croissant Benedict ($9.25). If you still have room, try a Peach-es and Cream Muffin, which comes split, 
warm and grilled ($2.45).
The Jones Eastside [401 NE 23rd Ave.] –  
Getting to the Jones is a bit of a trek but al-
ways worth it (and luckily there is a second 
downtown location opening soon). Try the 
Jones Cakes ($6.50) made in either clas-sic buttermilk-style or the flaxseed-vegan version. Another great choice are the Jones Rancheros ($8.57) served on a toasted corn tortilla with organic black beans, salsa fr -esca, cheddar and pepper jack cheeses, av-ocado and sour cream. Don’t forget to grab a side of Eastside Potatoes ($5.50)!The Flying Biscuit Café [4150 NW 
16th Blvd.] – The menu here can be over -
whelming, but in the best way, because ev-erything looks (and is) delicious. If you’re 
craving carbs, go for the Orange-Scented 
French Toast ($7.50), which is topped with raspberry sauce and honey crème anglaise. The Creamy Dreamy Southern-Style grits ($2) are not to be missed (they come with 
most entrees) and neither is the Turkey 
Hash ($9.25) with two over-medium eggs, topped with cheese and served atop slow-roasted turkey pot roast. Get there early or 
eat at the bar, because the lines are always 
long.
Bagels and Noodles [1222 W. Univer -
sity Ave.] – This laid-back restaurant is 
everything you want when you might 
have — ahem — gone out for beverages 
the previous night. Everything from the kitschy décor to the friendly staff makes you want to stay for hours chowing down 
on an Eggel bagel sandwich ($3.76) or one 
of the massive omelettes ($8 to $9). Why the “noodles” you ask? Well, the original owner teamed up with a Vietnamese co-owner to incorporate Pho and other Asian 
dishes in the menu. Try ordering a Viet-
namese coffee ($2.99) with breakfast — it comes in a French press! THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

LOCATED AT 305 SE SECOND AVE.

The Academy for Five Ele-
ment Acupuncture offers a dif-
ferent take on the traditional 
Chinese medicine.
Unlike the more commonly 
known form of Chinese acu-
puncture, the acupuncturists at 
the clinic locate the Qi, which 
is the energy element in your body, through pulse tests and access it by pushing needles in and out of the body. 
The academy, at 305 SE 
Second Ave., has been cur -
ing anxiety, stress and aching muscles in Florida since 1988, 
and about 350 students have 
graduated from the school.
Clinical intern and third-
year student Saundra Ben-nett, 48, will graduate with a master’s degree in acupunc-
ture. She said the treatments 
give patients an overall sense of well-being and establishes harmony in the body that pro-
motes health, no matter the 
reason for the visit.
“This medicine has been 
alive for over 5,000 years,” Bennett said. “It wouldn’t have lasted so long if it didn’t 
work.” 
She said the clinic “manipu-
lates the energy in your body.” 
If there is a block in the energy 
flow, the needles remove the 
block and promote circulation so the flow can become bal-anced and maintain a better physical state.
“As a patient, you’ll feel it,” 
Bennett said. “It’s a different sensation for everyone, but you definitely know it’s there.”
Licensed acupuncturists, 
who have been in practice for at least 20 years, oversee all treatments, and there are 25 interns. 
The clinic encourages stu-
dents and local residents to tour the facility and receive a free 30-minute consultation.  The initial fee is $45, and ad-
ditional appointments are $35 
each or three for $100. For more information, visit www.acupuncturist.edu.Acupuncture school

There is so much tuneage and 
so little time to consume it all.  
You barely know the major 
news headlines in your city, let 
alone what music news you can look forward to enjoying. 
Not to fear, music lovers.
Lucky for us all, I overload my brain with music news 25/8, so I’m here to condense it into a pretty package for you. 
Come to me every month for 
the top news tips, perfectly tai-
lored for audiophiles: the albums 
to buy, the concerts to attend and, every so often, the music gossip you just can’t believe. 
Here’s what’s happening this 
month:
Bob DylanThe artist who almost needs 
no introduction, Bob Dylan, is bringing us his 35th studio album 
this month. 
On Sept. 11, Dylan will release 
“Tempest,” and the first single 
from the highly anticipated re-lease, “Duquesne Whistle,” is out 
now. 
Let us not forget a huge high-
light in American music and 
culture either: Earlier this year, 
Dylan received a Presidential 
Medal of Freedom honoring his profound impact as an artist and his extensive body of work as a singer-songwriter. Bow down to 
the Dylan.Alanis Morissette You Oughtta Know about a 
new Alanis Morissette album. 
(Jeez, that was awful. I’m sorry, but I had to.) 
“Havoc and Bright Lights” 
dropped Aug. 28 and reflects a different side of Morissette. While her past efforts were inflammato-ry, albeit still perfect responses, 
to tumultuous relationships and 
pent-up confrontations, her latest release showcases her new roles 
as a wife and mother and, in 
my opinion, a 
veteran musi-cian who’s paid her dues. The 
new approach 
is refreshing. 
In a recent interview with 
The Associated Press, Morissette comments about how the `90s 
grunge-pop queen is now just an-
other version of herself.  
DeLuna Fest
Florida got itself a (real) mu-
sic festival! Now in its third year, DeLuna Fest brings Pensacola 
Beach, Fla. a jam-packed, well-
rounded lineup of artists, includ-ing Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters and Zac Brown Band headlining a list 
of more than 60 genre-spanning 
bands that are booked to rock.  
Single-day and full-weekend 
passes are still available for three days of sun and sweet tunes 
from Sept. 21 to 23. I mean, who 
wouldn’t want to go to a festival that’s dubbing itself “America’s 
Original Beach Party”?

Ben Folds Five
Ben Folds Five is back, y’all! 
The trio comprised of Ben Folds, 
Robert Sledge and Darren Jessee, 
will release Sept. 18 its first album in 13 years titled “The Sound Of The Life Of The Mind.” 
“Do It Anyway” is the first sin-
gle and is characteristically BFF, proving the group has picked up exactly where it left off since “The Unauthorized Biography Of 
Reinhold Messner.” 
According to the band’s offi-
cial website, the trio has teamed 
up with PledgeMusic, which co-ordinates artists and fan collabo-
rations for charities and other 
projects. This means a portion of album and merchandise sales purchased through PledgeMusic 
will be donated to music educa-
tion and music therapy. Listen-ing to Ben Folds Five does us all a lot of good.In the mix: music news for Septembermusic

Maegan Dennis / Alligator StaffDear Mediocre Advice,
I woke up with the worst hangover due to 
my 21st birthday. What do I do? How do I get rid of this agony?
Dear Friend,
Everyone has their own gross routine to get over the hell that is a deserved hangover. My routine? One whole pizza, one or two barf sessions and a long nap. Next time, prevent the whole episode. Before you sleep, chug water and eat drunk food (food so greasy and lacking in quality that you would never eat it while sober). Unfortunately, by the time this 
prints you will either be better or dead.Dear Mediocre Advice,
So, I think I may still have feelings for my ex. We are on good terms, and I have been dating a few people in the mean-time, but every time I see him I still get anxious. I want to be good friends, but I’m finding out that it’s easier said than done. I just want to know if it’s truly pos-sible to be good friends with someone 
who you used to bone and not eventu-
ally want something more. What do you 
suggest I do?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been hooking up on and off with this dude for about a year. We bone, and when er are together he acts like he really cares. When I bring up dating, he gets weird and 
distant. How can I lock him down?
Dear Friend,
You can’t lock down someone who doesn’t want to be with you. He probably thinks you two are just friends with benefits, and he may even be seeing other people.  Guys can still care, even if they don’t want to date. He’s been ramming you for almost a year so you should find out what he wants. If it doesn’t work out, just remember it’s no fun to be with 
someone that doesn’t want to be with you.
Dear Brother,
We must go out and celebrate. Let’s drink 
at Friday’s until we need Taco Bell to soak up the sinful amount of alcohol in our 
stomachs. Remember that time you got a 
major case of diarrhea from eating nachos at Denny’s? Me too. That’s what your beer sh*ts are going to feel like the next day. See you on Thanksgiving. Get home safe
.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m coming home from Afghanistan for Thanksgiving, and I want to take as many of my siblings out who will come and get absolutely hammered. (No cousins though — this is a sibling-and 
significant-other-only event.) Spending 
a year in Afghanistan has left me com-pletely out of touch with what is what. I could always just make a lot of food and buy a lot of alcohol and just have a stay-at-home party, but I don’t know. Friday’s maybe? What do you think?
Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
It is possible to be friends with someone you 
used to bump uglies with, but not until you both have mutual platonic feelings. The best thing to do is point out all of his flaws and the reasons why it would not have worked. For example, he is one of those annoying people who don’t watch the news to “protect” them-
selves or he uncontrollably farts in his sleep. 
Little things like these will make you grateful you two are done and you don’t have to deal with it. This is only one step in getting over him. Until you do, it doesn’t get easier to be his friend. Still, feelings may linger and screw up future relationships. He didn’t think you were good enough for him, so why is he good 
enough for you?KARILLA DYER

After the critical and fi-
nancial success of “Brides-maids,” women have finally been recognized as contend-
ers for lead comedic roles. 
Audiences have expected that more female-dominated comedy films would follow, and one is on it’s way this weekend.
“Bachelorette,” premieres 
Sept. 7, starring “Brides-maids” cast member Rebel 
Wilson alongside Kirsten 
Dunst, Isla Fischer and Lizzy Caplan.
Wilson had only a small 
role in “Bridesmaids” as Brynn, the oddball British sister with the infected tat-too and talent for insults. Al-though Wilson was only in 
a few scenes, she stole each 
one and served as one of the best parts of the film. She is sure to shine through in her leading role in “Bachelorette” as a recently engaged wom-an named Becky who calls on three of her high school “friends” to join her wedding 
party.
Dunst, Fischer and Caplan 
play the three best friends 
who agree to throw Becky a wild bachelorette party as a way to put the past behind them, despite secretly having ridiculed her in high school.
After their debauchery 
leads to an unfortunate acci-dent with the wedding dress, 
the girls embark on an adven-
ture to make things right be-fore the wedding day.
“Bachelorette” has all the 
elements of a successful com-edy. With a solid cast of funny women wreaking havoc and leaving disaster in their wake, audience members will be 
captivated by the humorous 
sequence of events. The suc-cess of this film will further prove that women should be considered leaders in comedy and held in high esteem next to male comedians.
Female comedies are not 
only geared toward women. 
They appeal to male au-diences be-cause they are down-right funny. It is unex-pected for men to say 
he is seeing 
a film entitled “Bridesmaids” or “Bachelorette,” but they will because women can be hilarious in the exact same way that men can be. The premise might be feminine, but the comedy is gender-neutral.
When deciding what to 
see at the movies Friday night, “Bachelorette” should be at the top of the list. It is without a doubt another out-rageous comedy with an out-standing female cast.

It’s September, which means the iconic 
Moonman is back on television for one 
night of risqué sketches, likely lip-synced 
performances and musical debauchery.
MTV’s Video Music Awards will be 
broadcast live from the STAPLES Center 
in Los Angeles tonight at 8 p.m.
Kevin Hart, who is already receiving 
heat for two racial remarks in two separate promos, will host the show.
In one, Hart plots to form a threesome 
with “it couple” Kanye West and Kim Kar -
dashian by wearing white hoodies and referring to themselves as the KKK. In an-other, Hart shows up at a Green Day re-hearsal and demands the band be renamed 
Black Day. 
While some say those skits were in bad 
taste, others laughed when a third com-
mercial was revealed in which a doctor diagnosed the funny man with Bieber Fe-
ver.
Green Day will perform at the show 
for the fifth time, alongside returning per -
formers Pink, Alicia Keys and Rihanna. 
Taylor Swift will debut her new hit 
single “We Are Never Ever Getting Back 
Together” live for the first time, while Best New Artist nominees Frank Ocean and 
One Direction make their premiere VMA 
performances.
The Wanted, another Best New Art-
ist nominee, will give out one of the cov-eted Moonman statues. Other announcers 
include Miley Cyrus (with her despised 
new hairdo), Mac Miller, Andy Samberg, Rashida Jones, Ke$ha, Wiz Khalifa, 2 Chainz and the gold medal-winning U.S. 
women’s Olympic gymnastics team.
Calvin Harris, a VMA 
newcomer with four 
nominations, will pump up the party an hour 
before the show during 
the Red Carpet Report, hosted by Teen Wolf’s Holland Roden at 7 p.m. 
New X Factor judge Demi Lovato is also 
set to perform at the preshow.
Of course, this is MTV , so even the pre-
show has a preshow. 
At 6 p.m,. Snooki and friends will host 
an hour-long “Jersey Shore” look-back 
special as we head into the final season of the beloved show full of spray tans and fist 
pumping. The real question: Will Snooki’s 
newborn baby, Lorenzo, show up? And more important, what is his “Jersey Shore” nickname? Tune in to find out.12, ALLIGATOR §  THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2012

Among the chatter of those 
waiting in line at Simons Night-
club on its opening night, most 
seemed excited to see a new club 
in Gainesville. 
Unfortunately for some, the 
6,500-square-foot venue reached 
its maximum capacity by mid-
night Aug. 25 at the grand open-ing, which meant that the star-struck girls waiting impatiently in line couldn’t meet their favor -
ite Olympian.
“We couldn’t get in, because 
it was so packed,” said 19-year-old UF mathematics major Krista 
Petkov. “I wanted to meet Ryan 
Lochte so badly.” 
But before Simons Nightclub, 
8 S. Main St., hosted Olympic swimmers swimming in alcohol, it existed in Gainesville in the 
mid-1990s under a different rep-
utation.
The grand opening drew the 
attention of club-goers from ages 
18 to 40, with the higher end of 
the bell curve knowing and re-membering what the club used to stand for — the music. 
Simons had “great vibes 
and great music,” according to 26-year-old Gainesville resident Michael McNally. “It makes me feel great to know my hometown had such a hand in the history of 
the electronic music scene.”
Despite its music scene, the 
club shut down in 1999 before re-
opening last month.According to Simons’ web-
site, the club originally opened 
its doors to the public in October 
1990 by its former owner, Naji “Simon” Semrani. At first, the club did not sell liquor and was 
meant as a “members-only” club, 
but expanded due to its growing popularity in the area. 
It became most noted as the 
local spot where world-renown 
disc jockeys would perform. 
To some, the legendary club 
has lost the feeling that made it 
what it was. That’s how long-time resident and old Simons’ regular 
Antonio Mercado feels. Mercado, 
31, is a partner of the Dynasty Group, a promotion company that has brought modern elec-
tronic music acts like Laidback 
Luke and Madeon to Gainesville in recent years. 
“When I was here, it was late 
1999, John Digweed played a 
six-hour set if I’m not mistaken,” 
Mercado said. “The new Simons’ is a bottle club — nice finishes, but no heart.”
But when considering 101 
Management’s new alterations, the atmosphere is not compara-ble, Mercado said.
“I love the old Simons but 
would not go back to the old one only because the technology has passed it by,” Mercado said. “It would need a major face-lift to keep up with the current technol-ogy.”
In addition to the changes in 
aesthetics, the feeling of having your old friend “Simon” has left the building. 
The nightclub run by 101 
Management Group, which also owns other popular Gainesville hotspots such as 101 Cantina and 
101 Downtown.
According to Mercado, the 
new owners are using the his-
tory of the club to market it as the 
legendary electronic dance music oasis that it once was. But in re-ality, it is a place that focuses on 
selling bottles of alcohol to VIP 
tables.
“It is not the Simons of old 
with a face-lift,” Mercado said. “It’s a VIP club that is using the 
name to sell itself to people as a 
place where dance music is im-portant, since that’s what sells nowadays.”
When Semrani first opened 
the doors to the original Simons, it was supposed to be a haven for the genre he felt so passionate for. But now with electronic dance 
music finding its way into top 
40 billboard charts, it is another way to make money, according to Mercado. 
“It is not the return of a dance 
music Mecca. It’s the opposite,” he said. “If Simon were dead — which he isn’t — he would be rolling over in his grave.”Simons Nightclub resurrected, updatednightlife
“The new Simons’ is a 
bottle club — nice finishes, 
but no heart.”

The Los Angeles Dodgers have promoted former UF reliever Steven Rodriguez to 
the MLB club as part of the league-wide September roster expansions. Rodriguez is the second Gator who played for Kevin O’Sullivan to reach the big leagues.� CORNERBACK MISSED 2011 WITH A KNEE INJURY.
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 After missing all of last season 
with a lingering knee injury, Jer-
emy Brown is expected to return on Saturday and provide another 
piece to what coaches feel is al-ready a strong cornerback rota-
tion. 
  With Texas A&M likely to 
spread the ﬁ  eld in Kevin Sum-
lin’s air raid offense, UF coach Will Muschamp expects an add-
ed burden to be placed on the cornerback position. 
  “We’re going to be in some 
situations where we’ll have six [defensive backs] on the ﬁ  eld, 
and especially with that high-
tempo offense,” Muschamp said. 
“We’re going to have to roll and 
play a bunch of guys, and obvi-
ously Jeremy Brown coming back is going to be a beneﬁ  t for us.”
  Brown was regarded as a po-
tential starter in last year’s sec-
ondary before suffering a knee 
injury during fall practice that 
was originally expected to keep 
him out for about three weeks. Muschamp said multiple times 
during the 2012 season that 
Brown was close to a return, but 
that return never came. 
  Missing time due to injury 
was nothing new for Brown, who 
sat out all of 2008 and 2009 with 
back problems. 
  “(It) is a great story of hang-
ing in there and keep persever-
ing,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “I was really excited 
to see him come back.”
  Brown underwent wrist sur-
gery and missed all of 2012 train-
ing camp, but Muschamp and 
Quinn both spoke highly of his 
performance in recent practices. 
  “He is ready to go,” Muschamp 
said. “[He] actually looked really good [on Tuesday].”
  Quinn recalled the speed 
Brown showed on a pass break-
up in Tuesday’s practice, adding 
that the junior will be a valuable 
piece against the Aggies. 
  “For us to have another [de-
fensive back] with experience of his caliber is good,” Quinn said. 
“Physically, he’s feeling pretty 
good. Now it’s more of just get-
ting back into the football tech-
nique, football shape, more just 
the vision.”
  Quinn doesn’t know when 
Brown will return to the form he showed in 2010, when he started 
10 games, made three intercep-
tions and broke up ﬁ  ve passes. 
Brown may need some time be-fore he is ready to play at his highest level, but improvement 
is expected from week to week.

 Florida offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease wants Jordan 
Reed to get more touches.
  “He could have had a few 
more,” Pease said. “There 
were a couple of other throws 
we tried to get to him. Some things happened on one. We had some breakdowns in pro-tection here or there and a mis-read. He’s got to get more.”
  Reed proved a popular 
target for Jeff Driskel during the Gators’ season opener on 
Saturday. The quarterback-
turned-tight end tied Frankie Hammond Jr. and Quinton Dunbar with a team-high three catches in Florida’s 27-14 win against Bowling Green. Reed’s 33 receiving yards placed sec-ond among Gators pass-catch-ers. Two of Reed’s three catch-
es resulted in ﬁ  rst downs.
  Even without the ball in his hands, Reed proved his worth. 
On Mike Gillislee’s 38-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, Reed made the block that allowed Gillislee to take the ball up the right sideline on the way to the end zone.
  Reed, who has been work-
ing on his blocking with tight 
ends coach Derek Lewis, said 
that aspect of his game is the most improved since last sea-son.
  “Just footwork and hand 
placement, hat placement,” Reed said when summarizing his work on blocking. “Just being more physical and tena-
cious and things like that.UF wants Reed more

JURNY DUTY
Jeff Driskel needs to be un-
leashed.
  When the leash is unhooked, it is 
uncertain whether he will be a pow-
erful Great Dane or a miniature Chi-huahua, but the Gators need to ﬁ  nd out this Saturday.
  Will Muschamp said following 
Saturday’s win against Bowling Green that he did not give offensive coordinator Brent Pease enough lati-tude to throw the ball in the numer-ous third-and-short situations that Florida failed in.
  The emphasis on the run wasn’t 
limited to short-yardage plays, as the 
Gators ran the ball twice as much as 
they threw it against the Falcons.
  That will work against Bowling 
Green, but not against most defenses in the Southeastern Conference.
  Part of the onus falls on Driskel, 
who has repeatedly shown a ten-dency to go for the short, safe pass rather than the big play . The rest 
of the responsibility falls to the de-
cision-making team of Pease and Muschamp, who need to use more of the playbook, as they’ve indicated they will.
  Pease said 
D r i s k e l ’ s d o w n f i e l d pass attempts should in-crease as he 
gets better 
at seeing his 
options.
  “The receivers did do a good job 
of beating the coverage, and I think how I can help him is just maybe, one, you’ve got to show it and go back and go over and simulate it again,” Pease said. “(We’re) trying 
to use the same kind of progres-
sion. Sometimes I can change where their progression is at to get him to his open guys quicker and help him from the box, or change their read this week to make it a little bit easier for him.” 
  Driskel’s backup, Jacoby Brissett, 
took the only downﬁ  eld shot on Sat-urday , an incomplete pass to Andre Debose. The fact that he was even allowed to make that throw shows that the coaches do not have a total Gators must pass to win

(on Sharrif Floyd’s move from end to tackle)
“It’s getting better. I used to just 
throw my head in there, so now I use 
my hands more, so I guess it takes some pain off my neck.”
Defense misses opportunities: Flor -
ida forced two turnovers in its 27-14 
victory against Bowling Green on Saturday, but that’s not enough for defensive coordinator Dan Quinn. Marcus Roberson intercepted a pass from Falcons quarterback Matt Schilz on the first play of the fourth quarter, and Cody Riggs forced a fumble on a 
punt return recovered by Drew Ferris 
near the end of the game. Still, Florida fell short of Quinn’s goal of three take-aways per game. 
Both Riggs and Jaylen Watkins 
dropped potential picks in the second quarter.
“We had some missed opportuni-
ties for interceptions,” Quinn said. 
“We had two of those in the second-
ary that we thought we could get our hands on those balls and give the of-fense a chance to go back the other way with it. … Once you get your chance at them, you’ve got to convert on them.”Despite the low takeaway count, 
Quinn was happier with the Gators’ 
pass rush. Florida had one sack and 
three quarterback hurries.
“We did pressure the quarterback 
some,” Quinn said. “We didn’t get the same number that you’d like in a ball game, but I do think we affected the quarterback in that way.”
The Gators pass rush will earn a 
boost should Ronald Powell complete 
his rehab from a torn left ACL before 
year’s end. Florida coach Will Mus-champ has not given an update on Powell since he set Oct. 1 as a loose target date for the Buck linebacker’s re-turn on  Aug. 20. As part of his rehab, Powell is working with Quinn after practice.
“What we do, generally, is he does 
rehab and then we do some exercises and things post practice where we’re starting to get ready, whether it’s hands or rush and that kind of thing,” Quinn said.
Fowler earning significant reps: Fresh-
man Dante Fowler Jr. received more 
playing time than the majority of Flor -
ida’s first-year players in Saturday’s season opener. That trend will likely continue against Texas A&M.
“He had a good training camp,” 
Quinn said. “I wasn’t surprised that he played a lot of turns and that kind of stuff because I really felt like he was ready to do that.”
Fowler made three tackles, assist-
ed on a tackle for loss and notched a quarterback hurry against Bowling Green. Perhaps his biggest play came on a fourth-and-3 play on Florida’s 24-
yard line during the fourth quarter. In 
a two-score game, Fowler stopped Fal-cons running back John Pettigrew for no gain.
“He played a lot on third down for 
us and I think he’s really improving as a rusher,” Quinn said. “I’m kind of ex-cited to see where he can go to.”
Fowler has adjusted to the college 
game quicker than his fellow incom-ing defensive linemen. His ability to crack the lineup early is a testament to Fowler’s skill set.
“That’s the balance with the new 
players,” Quinn said. “Who’s able to handle it physically and how fast can you get acclimated from a terminology standpoint.”

Regardless of how quickly Brown gets 
back into football shape, Quinn thinks his 
presence will be a boost. 
“It’s good knowing that you have some 
corners who’ve had some experience,” 
Quinn said. 
Marcus Roberson claimed a prominent 
role in Brown’s absence and started the team’s first 10 games last year before fractur -
ing a bone in his neck — an injury that ended his season three games early. 
Roberson was a limited participant in 
spring practice but has come on strong in the 
fall. He started in UF’s opener against Bowl-
ing Green on Saturday, breaking up three 
passes and making the team’s only intercep-
tion. 
Roberson had an interception and only 
two pass break-ups in 2011. 
“I thought he had a couple of good plays 
down the field, whether it was cutting off a receiver on a deep ball or things like that,” 
Quinn said. “I was pleased with Marcus in 
the first time out, and for him to come back 
… from an injury last year and didn’t miss a 
beat in that way, it was good for him.”
Loucheiz Purifoy started opposite 
Roberson on Saturday but quickly gave way to Jaylen Watkins after missing a pair of tack-
les in the first quarter. 
Watkins said he expects to start against 
Texas A&M, but the coaches seem commit-
ted to rotating Roberson, Watkins, Purifoy, 
Brown and Cody Riggs. 
“They’re going to go with the guys who’s 
doing pretty good in that game,” Watkins said.

210 yards and both Michigan State touchdowns in a 17-13 win against Boise State. The favorite to be the 
No. 1 pick in next year’s NFL Draft, Matt Barkley has all of the tools to be the best player in college foot-ball. After a season that put him on the fringe of Heisman 
consideration, Barkley opened 2012 by going 23 of 38 for 372 yards and four touchdowns against Hawaii.

aversion to downfield passes. They just need to call more of those 
plays and encourage Driskel to not hold anything back.
As good as Mike Gillislee was against Bowling Green, the 
yards will not come that easy every week. SEC teams will load the box, forcing Driskel to try to beat them.
In 2011, Texas A&M had the country’s 109th-ranked pass de-
fense, allowing 276.3 yards per game. They are also replacing both starting cornerbacks and a safety. Saturday is the perfect opportu-nity for Florida to see if its newly named starter has what it takes to lead the team to a respectable SEC record. 
Barring an unexpected improvement in the Aggies secondary, 
Driskel will have opportunities to make big throws on Saturday . The coaches have to give him those chances by calling enough passing plays, and Driskel can’t hesitate to use his natural gifts.
If the coaches fail to hold up their end of that equation, then 
there is no reason to believe things will change against better defenses. If Driskel refuses to take chances, then he needs to be 
benched in favor of Brissett. The key to what little success the of-
fense had against Bowling Green was Gillislee, but he will be nul-lified if Florida can’t develop a semblance of a passing attack. 
Both right guard Jon Halapio and tight end Jordan Reed said 
Driskel has become more confident, and he has learned from ex-perience since being thrown into the fray last year against Ala-bama. Last season, Driskel averaged just 4.35 yards per attempt. 
If his teammates are correct about his improvements and the 
coaches take the leash off, then that number should increase dras-
tically against SEC teams. If it doesn’t, 2012 will be another dismal 
season for the Florida offense.

Gusts from Hurricane Isaac brought a whirlwind 
of emotions for Texas A&M.
On Aug. 28, just two days before the Aggies were 
scheduled to open their season, they found out their 
game against Louisiana Tech would be postponed.  
After the announcement, first-year Texas A&M 
coach Kevin Sumlin noticed a change of attitude in 
his players.
“I don’t think we can be any lower than we were 
without playing a game,” Sumlin said. “When you go 
through a situation where you are in camp and you have 26-27 practices, you are looking forward to play-
ing somebody else.”
Texas A&M will do that Saturday, hosting No. 24 
Florida in its first game as a member of the Southeast-
ern Conference.
Florida arrives at College Station off a sloppy 
home victory against Bowling Green in which it com-mitted 14 penalties and converted only 31 percent of third downs.
“I think it is good that we played our game; that 
we made mistakes and that we can’t make the same mistakes in Texas, obviously,” right guard Jon Halap-io said. “We won’t win if we make the same mistakes that we did against Bowling Green.”
The Aggies don’t have the luxury of fixing prob-
lems from the previous week’s game. 
Sumlin, the coach at Houston for the last four sea-
sons, brought in nine new assistant coaches in his first year at Texas A&M and would have appreciated the opportunity to have a dress rehearsal before the SEC 
opener.
“It’s an advantage for Florida to be able to play,” 
Sumlin said. “You make your most improvement between the first and second game. Obviously, that comes from experience. It’s an advantage to play and 
get to know your team.”
Not playing in Week 1 could work as both a posi-
tive and a negative for Texas A&M. 
With the Aggies’ new coaching staff and a lack of 
game film, Florida has no idea what to expect from its opponent.
Defensive players watched Houston tape for clues 
about the Aggies offense. 
Halapio said the offense looked at South Florida 
video, as Texas A&M defensive coordinator Mark Snyder coached there from 2010-2011.
“That can only go so far,” Florida 
defensive coordinator Dan Quinn 
said. “If I was a nickel or safety, I’ve 
got to cover this guy. I’d like to look to see what his speed is like and that kind of thing. 
“You have this balance of, ‘OK, 
I’d like to know who the opponent is, but at the same time know what the scheme is.’ That’s the challenge 
for the players this week.”
For the Aggies, the waiting game has ended and 
the mood has changed. They began studying Florida game tape earlier this week, and College Station has come alive.
College Gameday will film on campus for the first 
time since 2006. Sumlin said season tickets sold out faster than in any other season in school history.
“There’s a real buzz around here. It’s pretty easy 
when you’re on a campus with 50,000 students,” 
Sumlin said. “The people (are) letting them know 
that they’re excited with seeing [them] play this Sat-urday.”

Erika Tymrak entered Florida’s Sunday 
match against Florida International as the 
team’s top scorer, but she squandered multiple 
chances to extend her lead. 
The senior, who had totaled three points 
through the season’s first four matches, fired six shots against FIU but did not net a single one.
“I need to, obviously, put those shots away,” 
Tymrak said. “I was kind of lacking in having shots, period, in my previous games, so I think that the fact that I got some shots on is good, but obviously it’s not good enough. I need to 
put those away.”
Tymrak’s problem converting scoring op-
portunities was representative of the Gators’ 
only flaw against the Golden Panthers: the in-ability to convert on scoring chances.
“Our execution in terms of every facet of the 
game, except for finishing, was really good,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
Since upsetting then-No. 2 Duke on Aug. 26, 
Florida has taken 36 shots and scored only three goals, all of which came against unranked FIU.
Against No. 1 Florida State on Friday, UF 
had several opportunities broken up before it could create shots. The Gators’ defense kept 
them in the game and prevented the Seminoles 
from scoring a second time, but the offense failed to convert any of its numerous chances 
into goals.
“We certainly created some awesome chanc-
es,” Burleigh said after the loss to FSU. “Ulti-mately, that final execution was the difference 
in the game.”
The same lack of execution proved to be an issue against the Golden Panthers. However, 
Florida registered more shots against a weaker 
FIU defense, which allowed the Gators to score 
three goals.
“They were playing three in the back, which 
I think really favors us,” Burleigh said.
Florida matched its three-goal total from the 
Duke game, but was much less efficient.
Against the Blue Devils, the Gators scored 
three goals on only 10 shots. In the FIU game, 
Florida needed 24 shots to score three times.
“We just didn’t capitalize on all the chances 
that we had,” sophomore Tessa Andujar said. “We’ll definitely work on crossing and finish-
ing this week.”
Tymrak said she need-
ed to work on her decision making, including wheth-
er to pass to a teammate or take a shot when the 
opportunity presents itself.
Burleigh held an optional team practice on 
Tuesday to brush up on technique and try to 
help the team improve on finishing their scor -
ing opportunities.
“You don’t go out to attempt to work on 
finishing because that’s an outcome,” Burleigh 
said. “Is our plant foot in the right place, are we striking with the right surface of our foot? 
Those kind of things, that’s something we can 
do.”
No. 24 Florida (2-2-1) will face an unranked 
New Mexico team on Sunday at 1 p.m. in Gainesville. New Mexico (2-3-1) will play Geor -
gia on Friday.
“We have a lot to work on as a team,” Bur -
leigh said. “We’ve still got to get better in terms of when teams take away some of our weapons, 
like how do we adjust to that.”Tymrak, UF failing to capitalize on numerous scoring chancesSumlin

THE RALLY
  Greg: Florida’s problems with penalties 
should fall squarely on the shoulders of one man — coach Will Muschamp.
  The Gators were among the 10 most penal-
ized teams in the nation last year, drawing 7.7 
ﬂ  ags per game. They picked up right where 
they left off in 2012, committing 14 penalties for 106 yards in Saturday’s win.
  Muschamp says he’s exhausted every mea-
sure he knows, but he still deserves the blame for an effort that ﬂ  at out isn’t good enough. Especially when, as he admits, UF’s penalty problems stem from issues of discipline. 
  Plain and simple, Muschamp needs to do a 
better job of regulating his players.
  Joe: Pinning the problems of several on 
one person is a bit extreme.   It’s up to the play-ers — the people actually committing the pen-alties — to ﬁ  x the problem.
  Muschamp cannot hold Jordan Reed’s 
hand so he does not jump offsides, and he cer-tainly is not responsible for Andre Debose go-ing all Kimbo Slice on punter Brian Schmiedebusch  after he ran out of bounds.
  When Mus-
champ says he has exhausted every measure he knows,  I believe him. 
Besides, UF has a history of penalty prob-
lems. From 2007-2010, the Gators tallied 7.5 per contest.
    G r e g :  The players know they shouldn’t 
commit penalties. That’s Football 101. 
  But until a coach drills it into their heads 
that penalties are unacceptable, the same mis-takes will keep occuring. 
  Reed was called for two false starts on Sat-
urday, and on Wednesday he said his punish-ment was 11 pushups. Eleven! 
  Reed also said the coaches have a new policy of stopping practice to make all 11 players do up-downs if someone jumps early , which 
is certainly a step in 
the right direction.  
  But until Mus-
champ starts actu-ally pulling guys 
out of games as a result of the penalties, the message isn’t being sent strongly enough. 
  Last season, Muschamp said he couldn’t 
pull penalty-prone players because the team 
didn’t have the depth. But with Damien Ja-
cobs, Dante Fowler Jr. and Jonathan Bullard new to the rotation, Muschamp has no ex-cuses. 
  Until he starts punishing his players on 
gameday, he deserves the brunt of the blame. 
  Joe: Jaylen Watkins knows what’s up. On 
Tuesday , he described the Gators’ penalties problem as “errors on players, something they’ve got to control within themselves.”
James Wilson knows what’s up, too.  “We’ve got to be smarter about what we 
do,” he said.
  Pulling players from games may prove ef-
fective, but what happens if Jeff Driskel causes a delay of game? Bring on Jacoby Brissett and a reborn quarterback controversy.
  Besides, you’ve seen Muschamp on the 
sidelines. He’s not exactly a rational guy.
  You’re right, Greg. The up-downs are a ter-
riﬁ  c step. 
  Eleven push-ups are 11 push-ups. It’s 11 
more than Reed would have usually done. It’s 11 more than you and I have done combined in the last seven days.
  The penalties problem boils down to ma-
turity on the players’ part. Learn the game or get off the ﬁ  eld.
