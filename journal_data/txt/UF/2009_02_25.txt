Gainesville voters will soon decide whether 
to amend the city’s discrimination policy amid 
controversy.
The city election will be held on March 24, and the ballot will include a proposal, Amend-ment 1, to remove local anti-discrimination protections. Instead state-level protections would apply.
Amendment 1 supporters claim the vote 
will decide if male sexual predators will con-tinue to have access to public areas designated as women-only, like bathrooms.For those who oppose the amendment, the 
future of civil rights in Gainesville is at stake, in particular the rights of transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual people.
The amendment would nul-
lify Chapter 8 of the Gainesville 
Code of Ordinances, titled “Dis-
crimination.”
Instead, protections would be provided by 
the Florida Civil Rights Act at the state level, which outlaws discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, gender, national origin, age, handicap, marital or family status.
In effect, this would remove protected sta-
tus for transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual Gainesville residents and loosen protections for other classes.
The amendment would also prevent the 
city from creating any new protected statuses.
The objective and impact of this amend-
ment is heavily contested in Gainesville.Amendment would legalize discrimination

Political party supporters 
were out in full force on Tues-
day to pull students to the polls on the first day of Student Gov-ernment elections. However, the 
day was not without conflict. 
Although votes were not 
counted at the day’s end, SG Su-
pervisor of Elections Dan Siegel said he expected voter turnout was comparable to fall elections, 
which racked up about 5,000 
votes on the first day.
Voting continues today from 
8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
While candidates in compet-
ing parties were pleased with student turnout, partisan bick-ering reached new heights after the Orange and Blue Party aired 
commercials Monday and Tues-
day night through Cox Commu-nications’ cable services.
The commercials, which can be viewed on YouTube, criticize 
the Unite Party and its executive 
candidates. The three commer-cials, which cost $702, appeared on Cartoon Network, MTV and Comedy Central between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight.
In one commercial, Jordan 
Johnson, presidential candidate of the Unite Party, appears, say-
ing he does not “have to follow 
state laws.”
The video was recorded 
during an Elections Comission meeting earlier this semester.
But Johnson said he was mis-
represented in the ad.
“I promised a clean cam-
paign to talk about the issues 
and qualifications of the candi-
dates,” Johnson said. “In return, I am seeing professionally made attack ads against me for state-ments taken out of context.”

n BOTH PARTIES AGREED TO 
DISMISS THE COMPLAINT.

A sworn complaint against 
UF associate professor Anthony Falsetti for simple battery and the restraining order sought against him by UF assistant pro-fessor Martha Burt have been dis-missed.
Burt’s attorney filed paper-
work on Tuesday to dismiss his client’s petition for a restraining order.
Judge Robert P. Cates granted 
the motion in a hearing Tuesday morning.Burt also filed a sworn com-
plaint against 
Falsetti with the Gainesville Po-lice Department in January.
Both parties 
agreed to dis-miss the com-plaint earlier 
this month, said Spencer Mann, spokesman for the State Attor-ney’s Office.
In the complaint, Burt alleged 
that Falsetti became violent with her when she found him in bed with another woman, a lecturer at UF.
Burt and Falsetti had been in 
a romantic relationship for about two years, according to the com-plaint.The incident occurred in De-
cember, according to the com-plaint.
“The matter has been re-
solved,” said Nick Zissimopulos, Falsetti’s attorney, adding that it was a collaborative effort be-tween both parties.
Burt’s attorney, Brian S. Kram-
er, could not be reached for com-ment.

Obama: U.S. troops in Iraq to be removed by August 2010
WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama plans to remove 
all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by August of next year, administration 
officials said Tuesday, ending the war that helped define his upstart presidential campaign.
The withdrawal plan could help Obama turn his attention to an-
other campaign pledge: Deploying more troops to Afghanistan, a re-gion he calls the central front in the war on terrorism. The timetable is a compromise. Removing people equipment presents logistical difficul-ties. Some commanders and advisers worry that security gains could backslide in Iraq if troops are brought out too soon, while others think the bulk of U.S. combat work is long since done.SEE AMENDMENT , pAGE 5

“I was in great fear of my life as 
I dove out of the vehicle’s path,” Rochelle said. “If I would have not 
jumped out of the way I would 
have been killed.”
Lee drove away, and Rochelle 
chased him in his patrol car.
The chase continued across East 
University Avenue, up Northeast Waldo Road and north on North-east 11th Street where Lee crashed his Mercury into the fence at 1102 
NE Fifth Place.
Lee then got out of the car and 
ran into a nearby wooded area 
where he was caught by an Ala-chua County Sheriff’s office dog.
During a search of Lee’s car, of-
ficers found 0.5 grams of crack co-caine that was packaged for street sale.
Lee was charged with four 
felonies and two misdemeanors including attempted murder, pos-session of a controlled substance with intent to sell and flee or at-tempt to elude a police officer.
“This man attempted to drive 
over a police officer to avoid getting caught for such a small amount of 
narcotics,” Kameg said.

More than 1,400 people flocked 
to IHOP Tuesday to get their three 
free buttermilk pancakes in cel-
ebration of National Pancake Day. 
The restaurant chain held the 
event for the fourth year in a row, encouraging customers to make a donation to the Children’s Miracle Network at Shands Children’s Hospital. 
The waiting time reached a 
height of 20 minutes, with 15 to 20 parties listed at a time. Even dur-ing a midday slowdown, servers brought waters in Styrofoam to-go cups because clean glasses were unavailable.
Tony Pignone, one of two assis-tant managers on duty since 4 a.m., said he thought he saw lots of bills going into the giant, cardboard collection box by the entrance.
“We’re trying to way outdo last 
year,” he said. “I think we’re going to well outdo $800.” 
Last year, the IHOP on South-
west 13th Street served more than 1,000 visitors and raised $781. 
Scott Amerman and Troy 
Wolfer, both junior-level students at UF, said they came primarily to 
enjoy the giveaways.
“We heard about free pan-
cakes.” said Wolfer. “It’s all about 
free pancakes.”
Still, the two didn’t hesitate to 
order more food.
“It’s kind of cheap to go and 
just get nothing,” Amerman said.Over 1,400 flood

For students who wanted to know what’s up 
with the economy’s effect on UF, the Weaver Hall 
basement was the place to be Tuesday evening.
UF President Bernie Machen spoke to about 
50 students at the third installment of a meet-and-greet trek across the UF campus.
In an interview before the question-and-answer 
session, Machen said his collaboration with the 
Inter-Residence Hall Association was formed dur-
ing summer when both sides realized he wasn’t in touch with students.
The meet-and-greets were created with the in-
tent of reaching out to on-campus residents, though off-campus students are also encouraged to attend.
“On-campus students are special,” Machen said. 
“They provide a unique part of campus life.”
IRHA President Jonathan Sheffield said the fo-
rum was designed to be friendly and low-key.
“It really depends on both parties wanting to 
talk to each other,” he said.
The forum lasted about 45 minutes, sandwiched 
between one-on-one time with Machen and stu-dents who wished to shake his hand, introduce themselves or pose for photos.
Machen suggested the forum’s focus be on the economy, though he called the event “just a conver-sation about what’s on students’ minds.”
Most of the questions were about how budget 
cuts would affect departments and programs.
While Machen referred students to the deans of 
their colleges for more specific information, he said the university would do everything in its power 
to keep scholarship money and individual college 
funding.
Josh Perry, a UF junior  ma-
joring in Chinese and English, 
said Tuesday was his second time attending a Machen forum, which was essentially more of 
the same.
 Perry said while Machen did 
a good job of being interested in student concerns, many of his 
answers were vague and unhelpful.
“Am I satisfied? No,” he said. “I’d still like to 
know what’s going on next year.”
Machen said UF will publish a report mid-April 
on the changes each college would make if its bud-get is slashed by 10 percent.  
“At that point everyone is gonna weigh in, and 
that’s what we want to happen,” he said. 
In May, UF will find out how much state fund-
ing the university will receive.Students meet with Machen
Optimistic Obama calls on nation to shoulder responsibility
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — President 
Barack Obama promised a na-tion shuddering in economic crisis Tuesday night that he would lead it from a dire “day of reckoning” to a 
brighter future, summoning politi-
cians and public alike to shoulder responsibility for hard choices and shared sacrifice.“The time to take charge of our 
future is here,” Obama declared, 
delivering his first address to a joint 
session of Congress.
Offering words of reassurance to 
an anxious nation, he said, “Tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.”
“We are a nation that has seen promise and peril,” he said. “Now we must be that nation again.”
To deal with the current crisis, 
deepening each day, the president said more money will be needed to 
rescue troubled banks beyond the $700 billion already committed last year. He said he knows that bailout billions for banks are unpopular — “I promise you, I get it,” he said — but he also insisted that was the 
only way to get credit moving again 
to households and businesses, the lifeblood of the American economy. Along with aid for banks, he also called on Congress to move quickly to overhaul the nation’s outdated fi-nancial market regulations.
“I ask this Congress to join me in 
doing whatever proves necessary,” Obama said. “Because we cannot consign our nation to an open-end-
ed recession.”
Thinking longer-term, Obama 
said in a speech lacking many spe-
cifics and devoid of initiatives that both parties must give up favored programs while uniting behind his promises to build better schools, ex-pand health care coverage and move the nation to “greener” fuel use.Machen

A resolution was passed unanimously by  
Student Senate on Tuesday night urging UF’s 
administration to save the Korean and Vietnam-ese programs in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The programs will be eliminated in 
May. 
Seven students who will be personally af-
fected by the program cuts stopped by to ask 
senators for their support.
Gator Party Sen. Megan Vu, the author of the 
resolution, said UF is currently the only univer-sity in Florida that offers these programs. She said the diversity of UF’s Student Body and fac-ulty will decrease once these classes are cut. 
Two professors will lose their jobs as a result, 
she said.  
Vu said UF first decided to cut the programs 
in June after a $47 million budget cut was made across Florida’s state universities, adding that students and teachers protested in response to the programs’ eliminations.
She said Joe Glover, then-interim dean of 
CLAS, was unresponsive to their complaints.  
Vu said she met with current CLAS Dean 
Paul D’Anieri during fall to discuss other op-
tions that could be taken and to ask why the 
programs were cut.
“The answer he gave me was vague and un-
clear,” she said.
Vu said she does 
not expect the reso-lution to produce magic results. 
“It’s highly un-
likely they’ll overturn their decision and there 
will suddenly be money,” she said. “I just hope 
there will be open discussion and they will take students seriously.” 
Still, Vu said she was encouraged by  sena-
tors’ enthusiastic support of the resolution. 
“It’s been a long day of campaigning, but we 
still have the heart to come and work toward important issues,” she said.SG fights for cut programs
Cancer, alcohol use linked
THE ASSoCi ATED PRESS
 
WASHINGTON  — A 
study of nearly 1.3 million Brit-
ish women offers yet more evi-dence that moderate alcohol 
consumption increases the risk 
of a handful of cancers.
British researchers sur-
veyed middle-aged women at breast cancer screening clin-ics about their drinking habits and tracked their health for seven years.
A quarter of the women re-
ported no alcohol use. Nearly all the rest reported fewer than three drinks a day; the aver-age was one drink a day. Re-searchers compared the light-est drinkers — two or fewer drinks a week — with people who drank more.
Each extra drink per day in-
creased the risk of breast, rectal and liver cancer, University of Oxford researchers reported Tuesday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The type of alcohol — wine, beer or liquor — didn’t matter.
That supports earlier re-
search, but the new wrinkle: Alcohol consumption was linked to esophageal and oral cancers only when smokers drank.
Also, moderate drinkers 
actually had a lower risk of thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and renal cell can-
cer.
For an individual woman, 
the overall alcohol risk is small. In developed countries, about 118 of every 1,000 women de-
velop any of these cancers, and each extra daily drink added 11 breast cancers and four of the other types to that rate, the study found.
But population-wide, 13 
percent of those cancers in Brit-ain may be attributable to alco-
hol, the researchers concluded.
Moderate alcohol use has 
long been thought to be heart-
healthy, something the new research doesn’t address but that prompts repeated debate about safe levels. U.S. health guidelines already recommend that women consume no more 
than one drink a day; two a 
day for men, who metabolize alcohol differently

Citizens for Good Public Policy, the group 
that proposed the amendment, seeks to re-
move the Equal Access to Places of Public Ac-commodations article under Chapter 8.
The article gives transgender people the 
right to use whichever restroom fits their gen-der identity, among other provisions.
Transgendered people feel that their gen-
der, man or woman, is at odds with their bio-logical sex and express this through dress, be-havior and, sometimes, by undergoing sexual reassignment surgery.
Sexual predators, claiming to be transgen-
dered, could abuse the article and use it to 
scope out public restrooms for victims, said 
Jim Gilbert, a spokesman for Citizens for Good Public Policy.
“This is about the safety of Gainesville citi-
zens, of my wife and child,” he said.
However, once a group receives protected 
status it is unconstitutional to remove specific protections, which are considered discrimina-tion as decided by the Supreme Court case 
Romer v. Evans.
Therefore, the amendment was written to 
remove the whole discrimination chapter, not 
just the equal access article.
The rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual peo-
ple, enacted a decade ago, are not a target of the amendment, he said.
“I would consider that collateral damage,” he said.
Gilbert believes that the Gainesville City 
Commission is not trying to prevent discrimi-nation as much as is trying to look like a lead-ing progressive city in America, which is why the amendment prohibits additional provi-sions from being made, he said.
“Amendment 1 will prevent such social ex-
perimentation in the future,” he said.
But Equality is Gainesville’s Business, an 
anti-amendment group, has a different take.
To them, the issue is about civil rights, not 
sexual predators, said Shelbi Day, spokes-woman for Equality is Gainesville’s Business.
The amendment will take away rights from 
citizens while doing nothing to protect them from sexual predators, according to Day.
Judy Best, a volunteer for Equality is 
Gainesville’s Business, feels the ordinance couldn’t be abused by sexual predators.
“That’s a legal matter, but this is all about 
discrimination,” she said. “It’s always been.”
For Zoe Falcone, a Gainesville male-to-fe-
male transgendered person, the amendment could affect important life decisions.
Falcone is a UF botany major and is consid-
ering graduate school in Gainesville.
But the charter amendment, along with 
state Amendment 2, which banned civil unions in Florida last year, makes Falcone feel that transgenders are unwanted in Florida.
“If this amendment passes, I’ll be on the 
first plane out of here once I graduate,” she said.The proposed amendment is a result of the 
transgender community being widely misun-derstood, she said.
“The Gainesville transgender community 
is really just a bunch of normal people with a special issue,” she said.
The amendment would stop the commis-
sion from pursuing its plans to add protec-
tions for veterans, pregnant woman and the overweight, said Jeanna Mastrodicasa, a city 
commissioner who opposes the amendment.
“Our local economy is based so much on 
tolerance,” she said.
Gainesville’s economy relies on creative 
people, and tolerance encourages those people to move here, she said.
“We’re talking about discrimination against 
people as collateral damage,” she said.
Voters will decide fate of controversial discrimination amendment
feel the commercials were personal attacks, just appropriate campaign tactics.
“Look, we are who we’ve always 
been,” he said. “We’re standing 
up against these people no matter 
what.”
Meanwhile, Sen. Ben Dictor, the 
Student Body presidential candidate of the Progress Party, said it was un-fortunate the Orange and Blue Party had resorted to personal attacks.“It’s sad to see Orange and Blue 
stoop to this level,” said Dictor, who left the party earlier this semester. “They have become everything they have tried to fight against.”
Miorelli said he didn’t think the 
commercials were reminiscent of mudslinging tactics taken by the 
Gator Party last semester, when 
members  handed out  “LIES” fli-ers attacking the Orange and Blue Party’s platform.
“Those were poorly executed,” 
Miorelli said. “They were not accu-rate, and the grammar was incor-rect. I was more upset about their poor quality than anything else.” 
Aside from campaigning, Tues-day presented two other sticky situ-ations.
A roll of 1,000 “I Voted” stickers 
went missing from the Southwest Recreation Center’s polling location, according to Siegel, who said he was frustrated by the act.
“Whoever did it is trying to sup-
press voting turnout,” he said, add-ing about $2,000 was spent on the stickers. 
Another issue involving “I Vot-
ed” stickers arose after Matt Martz, an independent Senate candidate, made a public records request for the designs of the stickers.
While multiple designs were con-
sidered, Martz said he only received two, neither of which was chosen. As a result, he said he has filed law-suits against Siegel and UF with the Circuit Court. 
Martz said he requested the 
sticker designs because he believes certain student organizations use the stickers as means of document-ing which of their members vote.
Siegel said three designs were or-
dered and had no other comments about the pending lawsuit.

Obama’s speech calls 
on Americans for change
Conan’s move will shake up late-nightColumn
While the path will not be easy, President Barack Obama 
outlined a clear-cut plan seeking to remedy the current ills af-
fecting America.
In his powerful State of the Nation speech to Congress, 
Obama stated early on that his policies will mark a clear sepa-
ration from the past, as both the government and the citizens 
of the United States must be more responsible as they move forward. 
In outlining his recovery plan, Obama remarked that he 
does not believe in bigger government, but rather in acting boldly and wisely to ensure the long-term success of the coun-try. He stood firmly behind his first major course of action in the passage of the stimulus package, adding that the failure to act would have cost countless citizens jobs and prohibited 
95 percent of Americans from receiving a tax cut. Addition-
ally, he spoke of a tax credit for college students — enabling millions to pay for four years of higher education without ac-cumulating endless debt.
The key focus under Obama’s direction to right the econ-
omy was directed to the everyday hardworking Americans. Stating, “Slowly but surely, confidence will return and our economy will recover,” Obama offered the nation a look at the harsh uphill battle that America will face, but with hope of a 
chance to once again thrive. Simply put, there is no overnight 
quick fix but rather a series of long-term investments that will lead to new jobs and increased competition on the global mar-ket.
Obama went on to tout the importance of Recovery.gov — 
a Web site that shows Americans where stimulus money is be-ing spent, allowing for a sense of transparency that rarely ex-ists in the federal government. Making sure to hit on the credit crisis, Obama stated that it affects everyone, but that Ameri-
cans can rest assured that their money and insurance are safe. 
In his mind, credit acts as the lifeblood of the economy — en-abling citizens to purchase vehicles and homes and start busi-nesses with the loans. While Obama admitted that the stimu-lus package is just the first step in correcting the economy, he was more than prepared to provide Congress with a laundry list calling attention the need to focus on energy, health care and education.
With energy, he emphasized a dedication to finding a fuel 
source that is not only clean and renewable but also profitable. Calling for legislation to focus attention on increased research in the field, Obama announced a commitment of $15 billion to double renewable energy sources.
Obama addressed the importance of health care by talking 
about how many small businesses were forced to close and big corporations left no choice but to lay off workers due to rising costs of insurance. Speaking with conviction, Obama proud-ly proclaimed that more had been accomplished in the past 
30 days than the past decade to create important changes to 
health care. Much to the enthusiasm of the audience, Obama concluded his discussion on the subject by demanding a cure for cancer as well as ensuring health care for all.
The final major focus area of his speech dealt with educa-
tion — stating that a lack of knowledge is a prescription for economic decline. Under his direction, Obama wants to en-sure that every child in America has access to the best edu-cation possible. In perhaps his most poignant remark of the evening, Obama spoke candidly to the many students across the country who dropped out of school.
“It’s not just quitting on yourself; you’re quitting on your 
country.”
A stoic, if not sobering, account of the realities of the state 
of America, Obama’s speech provided a semblance of hope for the masses desperately seeking any hint at economic upturn.
Conan O’Brien hung up his invisible strings Friday 
after a 16-year-long run of “Late Night with Conan O’Brien.” This is a part of NBC’s move to shake up 
its late-night lineup to save some dough.
The game of television show host musical chairs will 
involve O’Brien taking over “The Tonight Show,” Jimmy Fallon hosting “Late Night,” and Jay Leno moving to his 
own 10 p.m. talk show. In pushing late night talk shows 
into the territory of prime-time programming, NBC can cut back on its dramas, which cost the network millions more to make per episode.
Even if it is to decrease the bottom line, this shuffle of 
hosts is a clear sign that the era of late-night television isn’t ending any time soon. People need comedians will-ing to be humorous for the simple sake of humor more than ever, but what does this mean for America’s favorite 
swoop-haired Tarja Halonen lookalike?
O’Brien has amassed his very own cult following. 
He’s just such an awkward buffoon that some can’t help 
but adore his absurdist humor. He has come full circle: O’Brien is so untcool that he has redefined the meaning 
of the word “cool.” Honestly, how many people can pull 
on a lever and have clips from “Walker, Texas Ranger” magically appear?
With his endearing self-deprecation, O’Brien constant-
ly announced to his audience that “Late Night” just wasn’t that good. They obviously begged to differ, some of them waiting hours just to get standby tickets to the final taping of his show. That shows true commitment to the “humor-tastical wonderment” of the Cone Bone.
Does this mean that with a new time slot, Conan O’Brien 
will be forced to mature? The world caught a glimpse of a more humbled, thankful, almost — dare I say it — grown-up Consie at the end of his last show. Could this indicate a shift in his television personality as 
he makes the move to “The To-
night Show?”
Say it ain’t so, Conando!O’Brien’s shift to a more 
mainstream time slot is leading some to speculate that he will have to give up certain charac-ters that made “Late Night” un-
mistakably his.
“Late Night” was groundbreaking in that over the 
course of 2,725 episodes, it featured a crying Nazi in the audience, O’Brien zip lining across the studio while don-ning a steam-spouting helmet to save our sixteenth presi-
dent from being assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, and a 
bear that… well, you know.
While O’Brien takes his house band, the Max Weinberg 
7, along to its new home in Burbank, it may just be that the only change in the show’s dynamic will be that the censors 
will not take as kindly to a crotch-fondling bear or the rac-
ist, misogynist ghost from the heyday of radio who was murdered by the League of Women Voters.
In that case, let us welcome a new era of ridiculous 
characters that make up O’Brien’s entourage. Whether O’Brien changes or not, he will indeed be judged for it, and the judgment will come swiftly.
Good luck, you long-limbed, Irish wag. And stay true 
to the slightly creepy, beady-eyed fool you are. We’ll see 
you in June.

This past Friday, President 
Bernie Machen declared 
that UF needs to transform 
itself in order to become one of the nation’s top public universi-
ties. Machen said that the plan is to “focus more on graduate 
education and research.” As co-
president of Graduate Assistants 
United (GAU), our graduate em-
ployee labor union, I welcome the president’s new vision if — and 
only if — his focus on graduate 
education includes support for all departments, students and gradu-
ate assistants. Indeed, graduate 
assistants need additional help and focus these days, especially in this difﬁ  cult economic climate. 
 As workers for the university, 
graduate assistants do the bulk of the teaching and research labor. 
Studies have shown that across the board, graduate instructors at 
UF score even higher on annual 
undergraduate student evalua-
tions than tenure and term fac-
ulty when it comes to availability, 
respect, stimulation and overall performance. Graduate students 
work hard for UF; they believe in 
quality education and share in the 
president’s desire to create a bet-
ter university.  
If Machen is serious about 
turning some of the university’s focus on graduate students, we also expect him to respect the val-
ue we provide for the university. 
This means helping graduate as-sistants during these tough times. GAU has been bargaining with 
the administration since last May. 
While we were able to negotiate some important new additions to 
the contract for grads, the admin-i s t r a t i o n 
has been 
intractable 
when it 
comes to 
providing 
additional economic assistance to 
us when we need it the most.  
Most graduate assistants have 
not received a stipend increase 
since 2006. As we are all aware, the cost of living has increased 
fairly dramatically since then. In 
addition to the increased cost of food, utilities and rent, employ-
ment fees, which graduate as-
sistants must pay every semester in order to work, have also risen. Over the past 10 months, we have 
compromised again and again 
with administration regarding our stipends and have offered, as 
our ﬁ  nal proposal, a modest one-time $400 bonus for this semester 
and an additional $400 bonus in 
the fall. This offer would cost the 
university less than 1 percent of 
the money it has on hand.  
As a non-recurring expense 
to the university, our proposal is more than an appropriate request. 
While we understand that the na-
tional economic situation is trou-
bling, we also know UF has the money to help graduate students. 
Last year, a report from Florida’s 
Auditor General revealed that the university has hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in unrestricted 
funds, which continue to grow each year. Additionally, Machen recently received a $275,000 bo-
nus, and hiring continues in many 
areas of the university. Finally, the passage of the recent federal 
stimulus package, along with the approved tuition increases, will 
bring even more funds to the 
university. Clearly, the money is 
available to help us out.  
In the face of 100 frustrated 
graduate students who showed up to our last bargaining session, 
the administration made it clear 
that, despite Machen’s recent 
rhetoric, UF does not prioritize 
graduate student labor. I want to offer President Machen the oppor-
tunity to make good on his word. 
Please, Mr. President, help us out. We are not asking for much. Over 
the years, we have helped pave 
the way for UF’s future success. By helping us out now when we need it the most, we will help you 
build UF into a sterling school for 
decades to come.   
 Aaron Cerny is the co-president of 
Graduate Assistants United. Graduate students should be rewarded for dedication to UFIt took me one 5-mile walk in 20-degree 
weather in the pitch black through the Oc-ala National Forest for me to kill my idols, 
or for them to nearly kill me.
 My newspaper adviser in high school 
would often regale me with stories of tran-scendentalists and “The Rainbow People,” as they’re called, who would retreat into nation-al parks for national and regional gatherings for periods of peace, reﬂ  ection and an escape from consumerism and corporatism. When I heard they were doing a long stint only an hour or so away, I decided, after much delib-eration, to experience it ﬁ  rst hand.
With thoughts of “On the Road” in mind, I 
expected to see people truly living outside of the status quo. Intellectuals who thought the “real world” was not for them and made a conscious effort to live outside or above it.
What I found was both disillusioning and 
frightening. 
Hippies do not exist anymore. In their 
stead, I found an array of felons in hiding, 
psychologically disturbed youth, feral chil-
dren and homeless teenagers with nowhere else to be but in the forest.
I had experiences with some of them 
previously. I had met a band of train hop-pers about a month before who had told me more about Rainbow gatherings. When I met them, I was ﬁ  lled with the romantic notion of responsibility-free traveling. I thought that I was talking to people like Kerouac, who had 
the gumption to set foot across the country 
and discover the spoils of America for them-selves. 
As that night progressed, my illusions 
about who I was talking to disappeared. I was not talking to a bunch of kids from square-shaped states who decided that suburban life was fraught with disappointment. I was talking to misﬁ  ts who, even if they tried their 
very best to stick out a normal life, would 
never meet the cut. They were compulsive liars, thieves, vagabonds and winos. 
Wasn’t the point of hippies supposed to 
be of merit? Weren’t they striving for some-thing, whether it be the end to Vietnam, a re-volt against the conﬁ  nement of the 1950s or god, anything else? 
There were some upsides of the excursion 
(I was able to trade “shiny rocks” for drugs, there were free pancakes and I got some ex-ercise) but there were mostly downsides (I got called a yuppie upward of 20 times for “having parents,” I almost got hypothermia and heat stroke in the same 12-hour span, and I was almost raped and dismembered by 
a boy who insist-
ed that I go out to his “ninja camp” with him deep into the prairie). But the biggest downside of all 
was that I realized that hippies, or beats, or whatever, no longer exist. 
No one once tried to talk to me about 
world issues. No one considered what they were doing revolutionary. No one wrote or made art (I did not meet a single person who had heard of “journalism.”). They were there out of necessity. I could leave at any time, and I did the next afternoon.
Maybe I am a yuppie (as soon as I came 
home I took a long shower, took an extreme 
amount of Flintstones vitamins, and gorged 
myself on sushi), but at least I have a sense of who I am and where I belong. That one night destroyed my qualms with living inside of a system. What is the alternative? In today’s world there is none. The best we can do is to try to change the system from inside. There is no hope in overturning anything if we just ignore it by living deep inside the woods. 
I will always wonder what became of the 
train-hopper kids I spent a long night with and about the kids I met at the Rainbow gath-ering. I hope they get out of that system be-cause it is far worse than the one of which I am a part. But I know they won’t. Living in that system is a drain. Once you’re in it for more than a month, you can never assimilate yourself in what is called “the real world.” Once you have nothing but shiny rocks and 
nothing more than an elementary school edu-
cation, you’re pretty much fucked.
But then again, what do they know of the 
world they abandoned? The world that they perceived as unbendingly cruel? Nothing. And for the most part, I wish to know nothing more of the world they call their own. And that’s where I’ll leave it, until I meet another group of kids who can temporarily make me 
abandon my own set of values and make me 
question my own self worth.

Skin Health
1.Why should I be concerned about skin can-
cer? 
Skin cancer is the most common type of 
cancer in the United State, which can affect anyone regardless of skin color. About one mil-
lion Americans get it each year. Considering 
that we live in Florida, always remember to use sunscreen so that you are protected. The Stu-
dent Health Care Center also has regular mole 
screenings. To learn more or to sign up for the next mole screening, call GatorWell Health Pro-motion Services at 392-1161 ext 4281.
Nutrition 
2. Why is breakfast so important? 
A healthy breakfast is extremely important. 
It refuels your body and gives you the neces-sary energy in order to start the day, which will ultimately allow you to perform better at school 
or work. Your breakfast should typically consist 
of a variety of foods including fruits and veg-etables, grains, dairy, and protein. Try grabbing a cup of yogurt and some fruit as you head out 
the door. 
3. Are dietary supplements better than food? 
All the necessary vitamins and minerals you 
need are found in the foods you eat, if you ob-tain a balanced diet.  If you are concerned that you aren’t getting all the nutrients you need, a 
nutritionist at GatorWell would be a great re-
source for you.4.What are some healthy snacks to eat “on 
the go?” As a student, it is hard to always ﬁ  nd time 
to cook or even eat a decent meal. Here are 
some healthy snacks you can eat when you are in a rush, whether it is for breakfast or a snack. 
Remember that snacks high in ﬁ  ber and pro-
tein will keep you feeling full for a longer period of time.  Trail mix, yogurt, chopped fruit, string 
cheese, granola bars, peanut butter sandwich-
es, nuts, whole grain cereals, carrots, bananas and apples. Get informed about your health-related issuesHEALTH QUESTIONS:

FAQ: health and fitness for the college lifestyle
Exercise
5. Do you have any tips on how to make exer-
cise more fun? 
There are various ways that you can have 
more fun while exercising. Dancing is one way to spice up your mundane exercise routine. You 
can also try bicycling, basketball, and swimming. 
The best part is you will be burning plenty of cal-ories without actually noticing it. You also have 
the option of attending group fitness classes at 
either the Student Recreation Center or South-west Recreation Center. 
6.Is it better to eat before or after exercise? 
Eating before or after exercising are both 
great strategies for performance, fitness, and health, but the decision lies in how you eat since 
it depends on your duration and rigor of exer-cise. Remember that eating is very important be-
cause it fuels your muscles before you exercise 
or refuels them after you exercise. 
Sexual Health
7. Can I get tested for HIV without health in-surance? 
The Alachua County Health Department 
(334-7960, ext. 79621) and the Student Health Care Center (392-1161) are great resources to 
get tested. At the health department, there is a 
sliding scale fee system, and there is an option-al $20 fee for anonymous testing. The Student 
Health Care Center has a $30 fee. A rapid test is 
available with results in 30 minutes, but may re-quire confirmatory testing. Planned Parenthood 
(377-0881) also administrates free, confidential 
HIV testing on Wednesdays 9am-12pm.  8. What are some benefits of Gardasil, the 
HPV vaccine? 
Gardasil is a vaccine that prevents women 
from getting cervical cancer and the four most common HPV types; two cause genital warts 
and two are the precursors to cervical cancer. The shot is taken in three increments and is 
considered ideal if taken before engaging in any 
type of sexual activity, but you can still take it afterwards. However, the vaccine will not cure 
an existing infection.  
Mental Health 
9. How many hours of sleep are enough?
For most adults, seven to eight hours of 
sleep is sufficient for academic productivity. Re-
member, that it is important to get enough sleep because it helps you perform better the follow-
ing day, reduce stress, and boost your immune 
system. For more information, visit the sleep podcast at HealthyGators.hhp.ufl.edu. 
10. I’ve been feeling really depressed lately. 
Where can I go to talk to someone? 
The Mental Health Services Department 
at the Student Health Care Center and the UF Counseling Center at Peabody Hall are great re-sources. Some of the services include individual 
and group counseling as well as biofeedback. 
These services can help you address personal problems in addition to school related issues. 
ATOD
11. Is it safer to smoke hookah than ciga-rettes? 
It is a myth that smoking hookah or a water 
pipe is safer than cigarettes. It is just as danger-ous. Actually, hookah smokers may inhale more 
tobacco than cigarette smokers in one sitting due to the massive volumes of smoke they in-
hale.  A typical hookah session lasts about 45 minutes, which is much longer than a cigarette 
break. You also get more nicotine from hookah, 
which leads to increased risk of addiction. Re-member that hookah still has numerous toxins 
within it that can lead to health complications 
such as lung cancer, heart disease, and other health complications. 
12. What do I do if I think my friend has alco-
hol poisoning? 
Alcohol poisoning is a serious consequence 
of consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. It is extremely important to know the signs and symptoms since it can happen to 
anyone. A person’s blood alcohol concentration 
(BAC) can continue to rise even after passing out or sleeping. It is important not to assume that 
the person will be fine by going to sleep. Some 
of the signs and symptoms of alcohol poison-ing include: Mental confusion, stupor, or coma, 
vomiting, seizures, slow breathing (fewer than 
eight breaths per minute), irregular breathing (10 seconds or more between breaths), hypo-
thermia (low body temperature), bluish skin 
color, and paleness.
Call 911 if someone is showing these signs 
and don’t leave the person alone!
Safety 
13. I get out of class late at night. What are some tips to stay safe? 
You should always try to be aware of your 
surroundings. For example, you should avoid the use of earphones. Walk briskly but confidently, 
and always keep your car keys ready to avoid 
digging through your bag to find them. Another alternative to walking is calling 392-SNAP for a ride anywhere on campus. Always remember to stay safe by wearing something reflective so you 
are readily seen by others. For more information 
on how to stay safe on campus go to the Healthy Gators 2010 website.
Cold and Flu Prevention
14. I got the flu shot. Can I still catch the flu? 
The flu shot cannot give you the flu. Instead, 
it reduces your chances of getting the illness. Other ways to reduce your chances are to wash your hands regularly, cover your cough, and if 
possible, avoid close contact with other individu-
als who may be sick. Remember that it is impor-tant to get vaccinated every year. 
15. How do I know the difference between a 
cold and the flu? 
It can be hard to tell the difference between 
a cold and the flu since both have similar symp-toms, but flu symptoms are worse than a cold. You usually have higher fevers with flu that can 
last 3-4 days, and the flu affects your whole body. 
You may feel extreme fatigue, achy muscles, dry cough and sore throat. 
16 .I seem to get sick often. Is there some-
thing wrong with my immune system? 
There are various ways to boost your im-
mune system. Believe it or not, getting a full night’s sleep can increase your immunity since it is connected to the balance of hormone levels. 
In addition, you can drink more water, eat a vari-
ety of nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables, and exercise more. Taking a basic daily multivita-
min/mineral supplement, avoiding excess sugar, 
alcohol, and cigarettes are also ways to give your immune system a boost. HEALTH , from page 10

Whether it was Thornton, 
Temple or Tasmin Mitchell (12 
points), UF didn’t have the am-
munition to keep up. 
“We didn’t execute our offense 
well toward the end,” freshman  
guard Erving Walker said. “I 
don’t think we were tired. They just outplayed us toward the 
end.”
At the half, the Tigers knew 
they were in for a ballgame with 
the unranked Gators.  
The teams went back and forth 
for the first 10 minutes of the sec-
ond half.
Walker hit a three only to have 
Temple follow it up with a mid-range jump shot. 
But then LSU took over in the 
final 10 minutes, and those are 
10 minutes the 
Gators would rather forget.
“In the sec-
ond half, they 
came with more energy,” Hodge said. 
“We just have to execute at the 
end and play hard.”
With the win, LSU clinched at 
least a share of the SEC regular-season title. 
As for the Gators, this loss 
makes Selection Sunday a whole 
lot more interesting than they 
would like, as they are not a lock for the NCAA Tournament just yet. 
It’s not going to get any easier 
either, as two of UF’s final three 
regular-season games are against 
SEC East contenders Tennessee and Kentucky. 
The third is a trip to Missis-
sippi State, the second place team in the West.Final three games of season pose test for team without secure Tourney spot
Walsh, after claiming three Super Bowls in eight years with the San Francisco 49ers, retired from the NFL after the third. 
But Pittsburgh Steelers great Chuck 
Knoll coached his team to four Super Bowl victories from 1974-79 and then stayed on to coach the team until 1991.
Maybe Meyer is more in Knoll’s breed 
than Walsh’s, but we won’t know for years.
There’s a great video on The Onion called “Tom Coughlin Retires From Fam-ily To Spend More Time With Team” that really highlights the ludicrous amount of time coaches spend with their teams. As the title implies, the video jokes about 
New York Giants coach Tom Coughlin 
“retiring” from home to spend even more time on the football field. 
The video includes this gem from a fic-
tional press release written by Coughlin: “The time constraints imposed by his fam-ily were distracting from his responsibili-ties as a football coach.”And that’s really how it is in some plac-
es — coaches are expected to go team first, family second, sleep if they can squeeze it in.
Meyer strikes me as the kind of man 
who loves his family too much to keep this up for 20 years, or even 10 more, as Ma-chen thinks. 
After every game, he’s on the field with 
his wife, Shelley, his arm around her as they sing the UF fight song.
His son, Nate, sat on his lap during the 
press conference after the Southeastern Conference Championship Game win in December.
And during a press conference in Mi-
ami before the national title game this year, Meyer had something to say about 
coaches who are in this business forever 
like Penn State’s Joe Paterno.
“There will be no chance I’ll be do-
ing this into my 70s or 80s,” Meyer said. 
“Zero. None.”
Don’t be shocked if, six years from now, 
Meyer decides he won’t even be doing this 
into his 50s.
ence for as many people as possible in his bullpen so they will be ready when needed in more pressure-filled situa-tions.
“There is nothing a coach can do for a player that ex-
perience will give them,” O’Sullivan said. “Until they get out here when it means something, there really is no way a coach can teach that.”
While the pitchers needed only 1 run of support, the 
batters did not want to be shown up. Five Gators came 
through with at least two hits each, and another five had two RBIs each. Senior left fielder Avery Barnes led the 
way with three hits and two RBIs in just five innings.
UF has now totaled 31 runs in its first four games, but 
the Gators have yet to record a home run this season.
Just like the pitching staff, young hitters got a chance 
to see the field for an extended period of time. Freshmen Tyler Thompson, Jerico Weitzel, Daniel Pigott and Ben McMahan took the field for the Gators late in the game.
Pigott and Weitzel both notched their first hits, and 
Pigott finished with two RBIs to add to his two hits.
UF will finish its two-game series against Eastern 
Michigan tonight at 6:30. Freshman Anthony DeSclafani will get the nod on the mound, and he will also be limited to 50-60 pitches in his first start.
KEATING BRINGS HOME HONOR: UF senior pitcher Patrick 
Keating was named the Southeastern Conference Pitcher of the Week by the league office Tuesday.
Keating took home the award after pitching seven in-
nings against then-No. 23 Louisville on Friday night in the team’s season-opening 6-3 win.

I DID NOT KNOW THAT POLL QUESTION ONLINEBy BRIAN STEELE
Alligator Staff Writer

BATON ROUGE, La. — Maybe Mar-
cus Thornton had an extra helping of 
Wheaties on Tuesday morning. 
Whether it was Wheaties, an extra nap 
or maybe just a feeling that he had to step up against a conference rival, it wasn’t helpful for the Gators. 
While Nick Calathes was good, scor-
ing 12 points and dishing out six assists, Thornton was better, as he scored 32 points while sinking six 3-pointers. The senior guard led the No. 18 Tigers (24-
4, 12-1 Southeastern Conference) to an 
81-75 win against the Gators at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center on Tuesday night.
The Gators (21-7, 8-5 SEC) had four 
players score in double figures (Calathes, Chandler Parsons, Walter Hodge and Alex Tyus), but it was the big shots and consistent scoring of Thornton and Gar-
rett Temple (21 points) that made the dif-
ference.
“We just played the best team in the 
league — on the road,” UF coach Billy 
Donovan said. “LSU tonight was better 
than us.”
While UF kept it close for the vast ma-
jority of the game — and even had a 41-37 halftime lead — LSU decided it had 
enough with 9:07 left in the game.
That’s when the Tigers went up by 7, 
and they never looked back. 
The closest the Gators would get was within 3 points, but the game was never in doubt as Thornton then came back 
with two free throws to make it 69-64.
“We could never really get over the 
hump,” Donovan said.UF played one of its more complete 
games of the year, but LSU simply had too many guns for the Gators to handle.

Thornton’s 32 lead Tigers over Gators

For someone who had not pitched in a 
game in close to two years, Justin Poovey 
showed very little rust.
The redshirt freshman threw four 
shutout innings and allowed only two hits in No. 24 UF’s 12-0 win at home against Eastern Michigan on Tuesday, 
and he only left the game early due to the 
pitch limit UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan set before the game — Poovey tossed 57 pitches.
Poovey’s success came from relying 
more on his defense to get the outs rather than on overpowering hitters.
“I pitch to contact, and our defense played great,” Poovey said. “We’ve had good defense all year, so I just kept pour-ing in strikes and let our defense work 
behind me.”
Although he had 
reached his limit, Poovey felt he still had at least another inning 
of work in him.
O’Sullivan expects 
Poovey’s pitch count to go up for his next out-
ing and is willing to use him this week-
end, but O’Sullivan was pleased with 
Poovey’s short debut.
“They all want to go one more, but 
that is a good sign of a competitor,” 
O’Sullivan said. “As a coach, you want 
someone who wants to go one more.” Poovey exited the game with a 9-run 
advantage, and O’Sullivan used the large lead to get other young arms experience.
Freshman Will Jolin got two innings 
of work in his second appearance of the season, and fellow freshman Greg Larson made his season debut in the ninth.
Junior lefty Tony Davis, who 
O’Sullivan expects to be a go-to guy in his bullpen, pitched the seventh inning, and junior Chas Spottswood threw in a game for the first time in his UF career.
The UF (4-0) bullpen combined for no 
runs over five innings and allowed just two hits. Only one hit all game for the Eagles made it to the outfield.
O’Sullivan wants to get game experi-Poovey makes impression in UF winIn an interview with The Orlan-
do Sentinel earlier this week, UF president Bernie Machen 
said he fears football coach Urban Meyer will burn out eventually.
“I think what will happen to Ur-
ban is he won’t go somewhere else, 
he’ll just burn out and quit,” Ma-
chen told 
the Senti-nel. “He’ll reach the 
point he 
can’t do it any lon-ger at the 
level he 
demands  of himself. Hopefully 
it’s not for 10 years.”
After thinking about it for a few 
days, it seems incredibly plausible that Meyer could burn out trying to sustain the high level of perfor-mance he expects from himself and his players every day.
Spending an entire season 
merely interviewing and writing about Meyer and the players each day was time consuming enough. 
But to be in the locker room, on the 
practice field, staying up late every night watching film? 
There has to be a breaking 
point.
There are horror stories from 
around the NCAA and the NFL of coaches sleeping in their offices, 
working 100-plus-hour weeks and 
seeing their families one day out of seven. 
The recruiting trail is as intense 
as it has ever been, and Meyer and his staff rarely get time off.
Sure, the thrill of victory and 
the feeling of winning a national championship have to be exhilarat-ing, but after so many years, Meyer 
could question if it’s all worth it.
There are examples of coach-
es quitting on top, for sure. Bill Burnout from 
Meyer would not surprise
