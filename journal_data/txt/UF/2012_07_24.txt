More than seven hours after 
starting an all-day rehearsal, the UF 
Fightin’ Gator Marching Band brass section was still picking up speed.
A graduate student stomped, 
clapped and beatboxed on a pedes-tal facing a group of band members. After only a few run-throughs, their tubas and trombones had turned the noise into the fat and mellow jazz of “Swing Swing Swing.”
The band departed Monday for 
London, where they will perform Friday before the opening ceremony 
of the 2012 Summer Olympics and 
other venues this week. But ﬁ  rst, they had to face 14 hours of continu-al rehearsing Sunday.
“It can be really overwhelming 
and draining,” said Rene Mark, 23, former tuba section leader and re-cent UF graduate.  “But marching season is so far away that we really 
do need the time to put on the music 
… it’s a lot to take in.”
It was the ﬁ  rst time all 216 mem-
bers of the marching band making the trip had met to rehearse together since receiving their sheet music in April.
One of the challenges the band 
faces performing abroad will be 
memorizing a set list almost 50 
songs long. Classic rock from The Who mixed with Adele ﬁ  lled the halls of Steinbrenner Band Building during Sunday’s ﬁ  nal rehearsal.
The set list contains almost a foot-
ball season’s worth of music, said Gator band director Jay Watkins.
“The drum majors or the direc-tors can call up anything at anytime during the show,” Mark said. “You 
just have to know it and be ready to 
play it.”
Watkins remained conﬁ  dent in 
the students’ preparedness. Dur-ing football season, marching band members learn a new halftime show 
for each home game.
“They’re used to playing in front 
of 90,000 people up close and per-
sonal,” Watkins said.  “I think we’re just moving to a different stage.”
The marching band’s journey 
to London began about a year and a half ago, according to Watkins. Olympic organizers asked for mate-

Browsing through the personals and 
casual encounters section on Gaines-
ville’s Craigslist page Thursday morn-ing, Demarquarius D. Truitt clicked on a post titled “yung 1 all by herself.”
At 1:22 a.m., Truitt, 23, sent an email 
to the original poster, who was looking for a man.
“What’s up, let’s have some fun,” he 
wrote.
He then asked for the woman’s age.“Im 14 is that 2 yung 4 u?” the girl 
wrote back.
Truitt then asked for the girl’s num-
ber and began texting her about plans to get together.
“We just gonna have good sex den I’ll 
bring you back,” he wrote.
Around 4:20 a.m., Truitt drove to meet 
the girl but was greeted by Gainesville Police, who arrested him.

Aira Karina Curad Mallari was in a rush to 
get home on Friday.
It was the weekend before her 18th birth-
day , and the ﬁ  rst time she was going home to 
see her family in Pinellas Park since starting 
Summer B at UF.
Mallari’s older brother called her four times 
while she was trying to leave her Beaty Tow-
ers dorm room, her suitemate Shakayla Taylor said.
Mallari and her brother, John, 23, were as 
thick as thieves. They were excited for the re-union. She told him she was on her way.
But the 17-year-old biochemistry freshman 
never made it home.
Mallari died Friday evening after crashing 
her car on Interstate 75 in Pasco County.She was traveling south at about 5:40 p.m. 
when she somehow lost control of her 2008 Honda Civic, according to published reports. The car crossed a grass median into the north-
bound lanes and hit two oth-er cars before splitting in half 
and catching ﬁ  re.
Kyle Mansﬁ  eld, 25, of 
Hernando, was hospitalized for his injuries after Mallari’s car collided with his Chevy pickup. Christine Penner, 46, of Largo, was treated for 
minor injuries at the scene.
Mallari was ﬂ  own to St. Joseph’s Hospital in 
Tampa, where she was later pronounced dead.
Back at Beaty , Mallari’s roommate, Destiny 
Weeks, knew something was wrong.

Douglass said 60 permits will 
be issued for goat hunting sea-

“They may get agitated. 
They’re territorial. They are, after all, wild animals,” he said. “This person puts on a goat suit, he changes the game. But as long as he accepts responsibility, it’s not illegal.”

Santas shake it up at annual

COPENHAGEN, Denmark 
— If Santa looks thinner than

A Zumba exercise class with 
hula hoops was a novelty at this year’s World Santa Congress, which brings St. Nicks from

week.
“It was a sweaty experience,

now I’m hooked. I think I will 
be doing some more Zumba 
in my spare-time,” chuckled 
Douglas Gowin, a 57-year-old 
Santa from Washington, D.C.
Now in its 55th consecutive 
year, the four-day World Santa Congress has more workouts 
on the schedule, including an 
obstacle course in which Santas 
must go down a chimney and climb an ice mountain.

‘Goat man’ spotted in moun-
tains of northern Utah
SALT LAKE CITY — A man 
spotted dressed in a goat suit 
among a herd of wild goats in the mountains of northern Utah has wildlife officials worried he 
could be in danger as hunting 
season approaches.
Phil Douglass of the Utah 
Division of Wildlife Resources said Friday the person is doing nothing illegal, but he worries the so-called “goat man” is un-aware of the dangers.
“My very first concern is the 
person doesn’t understand the risks,” Douglass said. “Who’s to say what could happen.”
Douglass said a man hik-
ing Sunday along Ben Lomond peak in the mountains above Ogden, about 40 miles north of Salt Lake City, spotted the per -
son dressed like a goat among 
a herd of real goats. The person 
provided some blurry photo-graphs to Douglass, who said they did not appear to have been altered.
Wildlife officials now just 
want to talk to the man so that he is aware of the dangers. There’s no telling what his in-
tentions are, Douglass said, but 
it is believed he could just be an extreme wildlife enthusiast.
“People do some pretty out 
there things in the name of en-joying wildlife. But I’ve never had a report like this,” Douglass said. “There’s a saying we have among biologists — You don’t 
go far enough, you don’t get the 
data. You go too far, you don’t go home. The same is true with

AURORA, Colo. — University 
of Colorado officials refused to re-
lease any significant details Mon-day on their yearlong association with James Holmes, the former 
neuroscience graduate student ac-
cused of killing 12 people at a mid-night movie in Aurora.
Law enforcement authorities 
have said Holmes was stockpiling weapons even as he was enrolled in a prestigious neuroscience grad-uate program at the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medi-
cal Campus.
University officials called a 
news conference Monday at which 
they said law enforcement officials had asked them to refrain from talking about the case. University officials also have cited privacy laws in not releasing details of Holmes’ academic record.
“We are not trying to be evasive. 
We’re trying to be as transparent as we can,” said Lilly Marks, vice president for health affairs.
Yet question after question 
went unanswered. Little bits of in-formation trickled past the refusals to answer, but for the most part, the news conference was marked by a lack of news.
The school’s silence has height-
ened the mystery surrounding Holmes, whom friends and ac-quaintances in his native Cali-
fornia described as smart and re-
served. After graduating from the University of California-Riverside, Holmes enrolled in the competitive graduate neuroscience program in June 2011. He won a prestigious National Institutes of Health grant that paid a $26,000 stipend in addi-tion to tuition.
Holmes, 24, resigned without 
explanation from the program June 10, the university said on Sunday.
On Monday, Barry Shur, dean 
of the university’s graduate school, described the doctoral program as a close-knit group in which profes-sors keep close tabs on their stu-dents.
“This is a family. It’s a team-
building, family environment,” Shur said. “(Professors) are very much in contact with the students in the program ... especially any student who might have academic or other difficulties,” he said.
If professors have concerns 
about a student’s well-being, Shur said, “we would expect faculty to 
reach out to support services.”
That only raised further ques-
tions about Holmes’ association 
with students and faculty at the sprawling campus in Aurora — and why several faculty members contacted by The Associated Press said the university had told them not to comment.
Shur denied that. He said the 
school had told students and fac-ulty they could refer reporters to the university’s public relations office.
“We told them that they have 
every right to interact with the me-dia if they choose,” Shur said.

In this June 1983 photo released by NASA, astronaut Sally Ride, a

July 29, 1966: Assistant Dean of Men (yes, really) L. Ver -
non V oyles says Florida freshmen have “a new look,” and the 
“look is good.” The former director of records and registration said the 1965 freshman class “is the best academically pre-pared and most able the UF has ever had.” Data collected in 
1965 indicates that more students are coming to the university 
from urban areas with 100,000 people or more, which, V oyles said, contributes to the students’ “better” look.
July 23, 1974: Members of the press are barred from attend-
ing meetings of the Affirmative Action Search Committee at UF. Committee Chairwoman Betty Siegel, UF associate dean of academic affairs, said the meetings must be secret to “‘pro-tect’ applicants whose current job status might be jeopardized 
if it became known they were job-hunting.”

Seven members of the Gator Robotics team won 
second place in the 15th International RoboSub 
Competition in San Diego with an autonomous ro-botic submarine.
The competition included 31 competition teams 
from 10 different countries, said Eric Schwartz, head coach of the SubjuGator submarine team and director of the project.
Cornell University won the competition and 
École de Technologie Supérieure (ETS) from Que-bec  placed third. Last year, ETS placed first, Cornell came in second and UF was third.
Computer engineering senior and former Gator 
Robotics president Camilo Buscaron, 23, said the competition involves complex work.
“Only a small set of people in the world can 
work on these problems,” he said.
The robot had to complete obstacle courses that 
included differentiating between colors and sounds and detecting movements.
The UF team won the competition from 2005 to 
2007, Schwartz said.
He said this submarine, though, is the team’s 
best.
Gator Robotics won a $4,000 prize Sunday but 
spent $3,800 shipping the submarine and equip-ment.
Schwartz said the team doesn’t compete for the 
money, but he still wants to win.
“We’ve gotta get first next year,” he said.Robotics team places second in competition

Gainesville Police are investi-
gating a shooting that occurred 
Monday afternoon at an apart-ment complex near Archer Road.
According to police, two men, 
whom police did not identify, were reported firing shots around 1 p.m. Monday from their car at University Commons on South-west Archer Road.
A witness gave police the ve-
hicle’s license plate number.
The tag led officers to an apart-ment at Regency Oaks near the intersection of Archer Road and Southwest 34th Street, said GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Tobias said police found 
the vehicle, and when they ap-proached the apartment, a wom-
an answered the door.
She told police two men fled 
from the apartment through the 
back.
Police caught one of the sus-
pects but were not able to find the other.
Officers found 9 mm shell cas-
ings at both University Commons and Regency Oaks.
At 1:43 p.m., UF sent out an 
alert about the incident, telling students a black male with dread-locks and tan shorts was armed and heading east.
At 2:52 p.m., UF sent out a sec-
ond alert reporting GPD did not 
find the suspect. A witness told 
police the suspect may have fled 
in an unknown vehicle.
If you have any information 
please call GPD at 352-955-1818.

The band’s official invitation to play the 
London Live pre-show to the 2012 Summer 
Olympics opening ceremonies came at the end 
of last September. The band will perform at Vic-toria Park at 8 p.m. Friday.
“For a majority of the world this is going 
to be the first time they see the University of Florida,” Watkins said. “We’re the true ambas-sadors.”
For Mark, it will be the first time she’s per -
formed out of the country since her parents 
bought her first music lessons in elementary 
school. Five instruments and nearly 20 years later, an opportunity presented itself.
But the expenses of the trip cost about 
$4,000 per student, totaling almost $1 million to send the 216 members and band staff. Many students’ finances were tight. Watkins said the initial count dropped by about 10 percent be-cause of the trip’s cost.
”I wasn’t sure if it was going to happen,” 
Mark said. “But I was going keep trying to 
make the payments until I couldn’t make them 
anymore.”
Mark sent emails to Gator clubs and orga-
nizations, asked other Gators for donations us-ing social networking and started a fundraising website to meet her goal.
“Eventually the donations started coming 
in,” she said. “I fundraised over $3,000.”
She plans on visiting family and sightsee-
ing. Still, she remains most excited to perform for an international audience.
“To be able to take the band abroad and 
share it with people who probably haven’t had a typical marching band experience is exhila-rating,” she said. “It’s something very unique to the SEC and America in general.”noticed Mallari’s Facebook wall filling up with posts saying “Rest In Peace.” She called Taylor, who had also gone home for the weekend.
“It’s crazy,” Weeks said. “It just seems like she’s go-
ing to come back.”
Mallari’s 18th birthday would have been Wednes-
day . Taylor, Weeks and a third roommate had already bought her a cake adorned with her favorite character, Hello Kitty.
That was the first thing Weeks noticed about Mallari: 
She had a Hello Kitty comforter on her bed, Hello Kitty cellphone cases, Hello Kitty clothing — even a Hello Kitty-themed Honda at home.
They were fast friends. They took turns cooking in 
the dorm kitchen, and Mallari impressed her roommates 
by cooking burgers with cheese inside the patties.
She had a plan to cover the shared refrigerator with 
pictures of all the boys the roommates liked.
“She was the mastermind of all of our boy schemes,” 
Taylor, an 18-year-old food science and human nutrition 
freshman, said.
But if she loved boys and cooking, she loved her fam-
ily much more.
Taylor said Mallari counted down the days until she 
could go home.
“Why are you so excited to leave us, Aira?” Taylor 
would ask her. “Don’t you love us?”
“I do,” Mallari would reply , “but I’m so excited to see 
my family.”
Taylor thinks that excitement might have been what 
caused Mallari to crash her car.
The two walked out to their cars together Friday af-
ternoon. Taylor was chilled on Monday remembering 
their conversation.
Taylor said Mallari asked her what the speed limit 
is on I-75.
She had never driven on the interstate alone.
Taylor told her. She knew Mallari and her brother 
were auto enthusiasts and that her brother had driven in excess of 100 miles per hour on the way up to Gainesville for residence hall move-in day.

Students will soon have to pay for ADHD testing at UF.
Starting in the Fall semester, the Counseling and Wellness 
Center will charge students to diagnose attention deficit hy-peractivity disorder, which used to be a  free service.
The new four-step process will take seven hours and will 
cost $175 per student.
“The testing process takes a long time, and it’s a lot of work,” said Dr. Lori Schwanhausser, a postdoctoral associate at the center. “We don’t want to use your time unless there’s a high likelihood ADHD is really what’s going on.”
The tests will be more comprehensive and accurate. More 
time and resources will be spent on each student to properly diagnose the condition.
Students will go through two 90-minute screening ses-
sions, one of which costs $25.
The third step is a three-hour, $150 evaluation including 
an IQ test, a personality test, an achievement test and a spe-cific test for ADHD.
Students will then receive feedback from counselors and 
learn about their options and available services.
Private practices charge up to $2,000 for similar tests, 
Schwanhausser said.
The center will set aside one-fourth of available testing 
slots for students who can’t afford the tests, said Dr. Clark Slagle, a clinical assistant professor at the center. Students must provide documentation of financial difficulties for aid.UF will charge students in Fall for currently free ADHD testing

Police exchanged messages with suspects and initiated meetings
eration Tailspin,” began on Wednesday after -
noon with about nine officers posing as 12- to 
14-year-old children online.
For the next few days, detectives exchanged 
emails and text messages with the male sus-pects.
During the conversations, the suspects 
talked about having sex with the girls.
Police lured the suspects to designated 
meeting spots and arrested them during the five-day operation.
The suspects are currently facing felony 
charges, which include using a two-way com-munication device to facilitate a felony, using a computer to solicit a child and a parent, and traveling to meet after using a computer to so-licit a child and guardian.
“This is something that we take very se-
riously here in Alachua County ,” Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell said at the press conference.
The sting used a grant worth about $400,000 
to lure the online sexual predators and arrest them, she said.
ASO reports gave these accounts of police 
arresting the suspects:
Harrell, a 19-year-old UF student from Plant 
City , believed he was talking to a 13-year-old 
girl about meeting to have sex. He later admit-
ted to police he traveled to have sex with the girl but did not have plans to go through with it. He was in Alachua County Jail and met a $3,000 bond.
Hurtt, 20, drove from Jacksonville thinking 
he was going to have sex with a 14-year-old girl.
During a text message conversation Thurs-
day, Hurtt asked the girl if she had condoms, writing he had one and “will probably need at least two or three,” according to the report.
Hurtt is in jail with a bond set at $750,000 as 
of Monday night.
Smith, 24, drove from Chiefland to 
Gainesville thinking he was going to have sex 
with a 14-year-old.
Smith later admitted he drove to Gainesville to have sex with the girl but suspected the ex-
change was a joke by his friends.
As of Monday night, Smith is in jail with a 
bond set at $500,000.
Kestel, 20, believed he was talking to a 12-
year-old girl and her guardian.
He drove from Lady Lake to meet and have 
sex with the girl.
Kestel later told police he denied having 
any intentions of having sex with the girl, ac-cording to the report.
Kestel is in jail with $500,000 bond as of 
Monday night.

John J. Ross made his way into the 
UF College of Medicine when J. Wayne 
Reitz referred to a man, not the student union.
He became a cherished ﬁ  gure in 
UF’s departments of pediatrics and neurology, where he was for 47 years.
Ross died July 17 at North Florida 
Regional Medical Center after he had a massive heart attack while playing 
tennis July 14. He was 83.
Ross, who grew up in Jacksonville, 
claimed state titles in a low hurdles 
track event and tennis at Robert E. Lee High School. He went to Duke Univer-sity as an undergraduate and was cap-tain of the tennis team there. Ross once played tennis with Arthur Ashe, who won three Grand Slam titles.
He continued on to Harvard Medi-
cal School for his M.D. He met his wife of 52 years, Nancy Hays Ross, while completing residency at Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital.
Ross could spend hours with pa-
tients, said Paul Carney , a colleague in the UF department of pediatrics.
“They don’t make ‘em like him 
anymore,” he said.
Ross was director and co-founder 
of the Multidisciplinary Diagnostic and Training Program at UF, which is part of a statewide diagnostic and in-structional program for children with disabilities.
Ross’ son, John Ross II, and Carney 
said the program would be the accom-
plishment Ross is most proud of, be-
sides his children.
John Ross II, 43, remembers his fa-
ther teaching him to play tennis and later leaving work to stand on the side-lines after practices and matches.
“In everything he did, my father al-
ways wanted to make a difference,” he said. “And that’s what he did.”
Ross was active until he died with 
the Holy Faith Catholic Church, Ala-chua County Medical Society , Gator Tennis Boosters, DB Racquet Club and Founders Society of the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History.
He had 31 appointments at teaching 
centers including UF, Harvard and the Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Boston. He also ran for the Florida House of Representatives in 2002.
He is survived by his wife, Nancy; 
three children; a brother, a sister and  nine grandchildren.TUESDAY, JULY 24, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� THE RESOLUTION WOULD ASK UF TO 
POSTPONE REMOVING NEWS RACKS UNTIL A STUDY OF THE EFFECTS IS COMPLETED.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
The Student Senate will hear a resolution today 
that asks UF administration to halt the removal of in-
dependently owned newspaper racks.
UF wants to replace independently owned racks 
with black modular racks owned by the university.
The Alligator started to collect data during Fall 
2011 and replaced ﬁ  ve of its own racks with the uni-
versity’s in Spring 2012. The Alligator then presented 
the data to retired professor David Denslow to com-plete an impact study.
The resolution asks the administration to not re-
place the racks until after Denslow completes the 
study.
Before the resolution could go to the Senate ﬂ  oor, it 
had to be passed by the Judiciary Committee on Sun-
day.
It was passed unfavorably.Sen. Justin Shifrin said if the Alligator is a business, 
it shouldn’t concern itself with Student Government.
Sen. Truman Williams said the modular units could 
increase free speech by juxtaposing different publica-
tions next to each other.
Bill author and committee member Sen. Umair 
Asghar said the removal of the racks could have dire 
consequences. 
He said the issues other members raised should be 
brought up in the Senate ﬂ  oor.
“If you feel uncomfortable telling administration to 
halt efforts, bring it up in Senate,” Asghar said.

Today’s question: Did you go see “The Dark Knight 
Rises”?
72 TOTAL VOTES50% YES
50% NOFriday’s question: Would you try the virtual Tour de Shands bicycle event?Let’s Be Honest:
It’s not about 
hurricanes
Last Thursday, the Alligator started its Save The Racks 
campaign in an effort to stop the UF administration 
from removing 19 of our orange racks from campus and 
replacing them with black university-owned modular racks similar to those on Turlington Plaza. To use these racks, the Alligator would have to sign a licensing agreement and pay a 
fee to the university.
In our editorial last week, we argued that this change could 
hurt the ability of the Alligator to serve the students of UF.
Since then, our efforts have been covered by various news 
outlets and student press organizations such as The Miami Herald and the Student Press Law Center.
This coverage has revealed a few reasons provided by the 
university about why they feel it is necessary to make this change.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando told the Student Press Law 
Center that administrators’ primary concerns were safety and aesthetics. “Every time we have a tropical storm or hurricane, 
we have to get the racks off campus,” he told the SPLC. The 
university worries that the “racks could become dangerous 
projectiles in a storm.”
The Alligator has offered to comply with whatever safety 
standards are necessary to secure our racks, including weigh-ing them down. However, we have not been told what these 
“standards” are. The Alligator has also previously offered 
to remove the racks in the event of a hurricane or tropical 
storm.
This “storm” argument is also absurd given that hurri-
canes rarely pop up overnight. We are usually given ample 
warning, during which we can remove the racks. 
Clearly, these safety concerns are just attempts to get 
around the main reason for the move: aesthetics and control. 
Orlando told the SPLC the administration thinks our current 
racks “didn’t blend in with the historic look of the campus.”
But does this concern for aesthetics really constitute 
enough of a compelling interest for a public institution like 
UF to not only control the distribution of a student paper on 
campus, but also charge us to $100 per unit each year to dis-tribute it? Considering that we provide a free and vital service 
to the university community, we cannot see any valid interest 
in the administration’s pursuits.
Again, this change could create a loss of visibility on cam-
pus for the Alligator, hurting our readership and reducing 
our advertising revenue. A loss of revenue will lead to fewer 
papers and fewer pages. 
As a result, the UF community will receive less informa-
tion focused on it.
The administration has tried to appease our concerns, tell-
ing us we can put a measly orange 2-by-11-inch sign in each 
of our modular units with our brand on it.
Well, at least people with good vision will still be able to 
locate us on campus.Romney could learn a lesson from sitcoms
“Mom, why doesn’t anybody like me?” asks a 
teenage daughter on any sitcom ever.
“Well, sweetie,” says the mother as she 
sits them both on the probably beige couch, “maybe be-cause you’ve been trying so hard lately. You don’t normally wear these clothes or such heavy makeup, do you?”
“No, I guess not,” says the daughter. “I just wanted to 
be like the popular girls in school. They always get all the attention!”
“Now, you listen to me. All those other kids? They don’t 
know what they’re missing out on,” says the mother. “Think about all your friends who like you just the way you are.”
__Tune into a family sitcom, and I guarantee you will catch 
that scene at some point. It’s the job of sitcoms to portray everyday struggles and to teach us how to deal with them.
Mitt Romney is the daughter in this scene when it comes 
to popularity on social networks.
His Facebook account has almost 24 million fewer fans 
than President Obama’s account.
His Tumblr noticeably and continually receives a paltry 
number of notes compared to Obama’s. For example, the most notes an original post has on the first page of Rom-ney’s Tumblr is 51.
That means 51 Tumblr accounts either liked or “re-
blogged” that post.
Obama’s first page has an original post with almost 
2,000 notes at the time of writing. The least popular posts on the first page still have more than 100 notes, something Romney’s account can’t claim.
But it’s Romney’s Twitter account that has recently been 
under scrutiny.
Less than a million users follow @MittRomney, while 
more than 17 million follow @BarackObama.
When Saturday evening rolled around, multiple web-
sites began to notice an extreme increase in Twitter follow-ers.In the past month, Romney 
gained about 3,000 to 4,000 fol-lowers each day. This Friday, 23,000 more accounts started fol-
lowing him, and 75,000 more fol-
lowed him on Saturday.
No matter who you are, or 
where you fall on the political spectrum, that’s a bizarrely high 
amount of new followers. But, so what? What’s the prob-lem?
A lot of those followers do not appear to be real people. 
That makes a lot of people think that he purchased these so-
called spam accounts in order to boost his numbers.
A few of the accounts have gobbledygook tweets, if they 
have any tweets at all. They also follow the same small 
number of other users.
Romney’s team has come forward to deny the purchase 
of Twitter followers.
I might come across as insensitive or disingenuous for a 
minute: In addition to accusing Romney of buying Twitter followers, people have also speculated that he did it this 
weekend on purpose. Perhaps he wanted it to be swept un-
der the news rug of Aurora, Colo.
Maybe Romney needs to spend some time in front of 
Netflix, maybe throw on some good ol’ “Family Ties.” Sit-coms show us time and time again that we don’t have to 
be something we’re not in order to succeed. You shouldn’t 
change yourself in order to become, or appear, more popu-lar.
Romney’s main demographic is not the typical social 
media user. They’re out there, but they’re not coming out of the woodwork when compared with Obama’s supporters.
Maybe Romney’s robot friends thought he was feeling 
lonely.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, JULY 24, 2012  ALLIGATOR, 7
This past weekend, crowds excitedly ﬁ  led into 
movie theaters ﬁ  lled with anticipation for the premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises.” 
Several minutes after midnight on July 20, the pre-
miere of the ﬁ  lm began. In Aurora, Colo., moviegoers’ 
viewing was cut short when James Holmes, dressed in 
what looked like SWAT team armor, allegedly burst 
into a theater and let loose rounds of ammunition into 
the crowd.
Every newspaper and media outlet had head-
lines about the costumed gunman and the violent 
plan he had just executed.
However, an interesting trend occurred as I read 
each article about the tragedy. 
Holmes wasn’t described as a murderer or cold-
blooded killer. 
Many articles described him as a shy and hard-
working student. 
They elaborated on the Ph.D. research project 
he was involved in and had quotes from peers who were shocked by his behavior.
The LA Times had a tagline that read, “Was James 
E. Holmes a brilliant loner? A nice guy with circles 
of friends? A stubborn near-dropout? ...”
What the media is doing is humanizing the mur-
derer that is James Holmes. 
By simply saying he was unstable and going 
through a rough time, the media is softening the 
impact of his actions.
They are hoping that we’ll reach the conclusion 
that James Holmes is just a guy who was pursuing his Ph.D, kept to himself and just cracked under the 
pressure.
It’s correct to say that Holmes was not in his 
right mind when he set out toward the theater that 
night. 
Yet why is Holmes being humanized and labeled 
as “mentally unstable” while others are branded with much harsher names and in turn end up bear-ing full responsibility for their actions?
Imagine if he had been a black man. What would 
the narrative have been? 
Would they have described him as shy? More 
than likely the news media would have used an ug-lier word.
Imagine if the shooter had been a Latino. What 
would they have speculated upon? The question of his immigration sta-tus would have likely slipped into the narra-
tive.
Imagine if the man 
had been from the Mid-
dle East. 
We all know what 
label would be written 
right under the mug shot.
As an example of this different treatment, one 
can look at the recent Miami “cannibal” incident. 
In a recent article, it was reported that Rudy Eu-
gene was not high on bath salts, and the only drug found in his system was marijuana. 
However, that hasn’t stopped the media from 
calling him the Highway Cannibal, despite only having chewed off a man’s face and not having in-gested it.
Even after the new evidence in the case, Eugene 
has not had the privilege of being called “mentally 
unstable.”
What’s the main difference between Holmes and 
Eugene? 
Bluntly put, Holmes is a white man while Eu-
gene is a black man.
One can ﬁ  nd countless other examples. Trayvon 
Martin was murdered, and yet the media was glee-
ful when trace amounts of marijuana were found in his system. 
It’s shameful how the mainstream media will 
use rhetoric to manipulate tragedies that take place in our nation.
I want to give my deepest condolences to the in-
jured, their families and the mourners. 
The shooting reminded us of the fragility of life 
and how even when we think we’re safe, danger could be hiding in the shadows.
Don’t let the softened rhetoric of the mainstream 
media diverge attention from the man who is James Holmes. 
That night he murdered innocent people and 
changed countless lives. Sugarcoating words won’t 
change the damage done.

shooting suspect because he is whiteColumn
Taxes have never quite sat right with the American people.
Since the very inception of our nation, taxes have been 
the bane of the average American’s existence and the No. 
1 cause for antagonism with our government.
We almost reﬂ  exively turn away in disgust at the mere men-
tion of a possible tax increase, and the promise of a tax cut is 
often the go-to strategy for campaigning politicians.
Yet, are all tax cuts necessarily good policy?The Bush tax cuts were a series of tax reforms passed in 2001 
and 2003 that greatly lowered taxes for the majority of Ameri-cans. The marginal tax rates for all income brackets were low-ered, as well as the capital gains tax and the tax on dividends.
These cuts were supposed to expire in 2010, but Congress 
renewed them for another year.
However, Obama announced earlier this month that he 
would push to allow the Bush tax cuts for households earning $250,000 or more a year to expire. His plan would extend the tax breaks for middle- and low-income families, who make up 98 percent of the population.
The announcement was met with disdain by Republicans 
who believe a tax increase in these harsh economic times would cripple the recovery.
Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney called 
Obama’s plan a “kick in the gut” to the economy.
Now, it is true that tax cuts have the potential to spur eco-
nomic progress, but this is largely dependent on the circum-stances of their passing.
The Bush tax cuts were passed during an administration that 
rapidly increased spending, be it on overseas wars or expensive domestic programs.
The Congressional Budget Ofﬁ  ce (CBO) estimated last month 
that, from 2002 to 2011, the Bush tax cuts in total have added 
nearly $1.6 trillion to the deﬁ  cit alone — and that’s not includ-
ing interest. Extending the cuts for everyone is projected to cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years.
Furthermore, the claim that lowering taxes, especially for the 
wealthy, increases prosperity for all does not have much cor-
relative data to back it up.
Federal tax rates have been 
falling almost consistently for the last 30 years. Yet, in the same time 
span, the top 1 percent of house-
holds have seen income grow by 
275 percent, while the middle 60 percent’s income only grew 40 percent, and the bottom 20 percent’s grew by merely 18 percent, according to the CBO.
Obviously the wealth has not been trickling down but has 
instead been concentrated into the hands of a few.
Yet opponents to Obama’s plan still maintain that a tax in-
crease on the top bracket would harm small businesses and the 
“job creators.”
Only about 2 to 3 percent of small businesses would qualify 
for a tax increase, according to the U.S. Treasury Department 
and the Joint Committee on Taxation, respectively.
As for the term “job creators,” it really needs to go. It’s a 
public relations phrase coined by Frank Luntz for the sole pur-pose of appealing to people’s emotions. It implies that an empty farmland would not be tilled or an empty mine mined without the interference of one of our beloved elite.
It is a necessity that creates jobs and the rampant inequality 
in this country that keeps many Americans from attaining the necessary capital to act on that necessity.
The CBO even found in 2010 that “increasing the after-tax 
income of businesses typically does not create much incentive for them to hire more workers.”
Yet, just as in 2010, Republicans are holding the tax cuts for 
the average American hostage in order to keep taxes lowered for the wealthy.
Obama’s plan isn’t even anything that one could consider 
radical. It merely would allow the tax rate for the top 2 percent of income earners to rise to 39.6 percent, the tax rate under the Clinton administration.
I do not deny that spending should also be cut in our federal 
government, but a strategy revolving solely around spending cuts is as harmful as one that revolves solely around tax hikes.
In these times of economic turmoil, I don’t understand why 
a family making $250,000 cannot contribute to helping its coun-
try pay a deﬁ  cit, while those making less than half that are just 
squeezing by.

  The Alligator Awards: Best Comeback — Volleyball
The Alligator Award for “Best Comeback” goes to Florida’s 3-2 road win 
against Arkansas on Nov. 13. UF won after dropping the ﬁ  rst two sets. 
THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
   As part of The Alligator Awards recog-
nizing the best in UF athletics during the 2011-12 season, columnists Joe 
Morgan and Corey McCall will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees in each week’s category. Vote for the winner at alligatorSports.org.
  Joe: After three years of using only their 
inside voices, the Gators could scream. 
The Florida men’s track and ﬁ  eld squad 
clinched its ﬁ  rst-ever outdoor national championship last month on the heels of earning a third consecutive NCAA indoor 
title in March.
The Gators brought home three na-
tional championships during the 2011-12 
athletic season, and two of them belong to coach Mike Holloway and his elite squad. 
Granted, Florida had a phenomenal athlet-ic run spanning 
the last year in sports. How-
ever, only one 
team won two national titles in 91 days. No oth-
er Gators team 
can keep — uh, track.
  Corey: You have just earned yourself 
a ban on puns, sir. What kind of Mickey 
Mouse operation are you running, oh, 
sorry — “John Carter” operation. With that said, now I can get on serve with my choice: women’s tennis. Honestly, you 
can’t go wrong with either of these teams, but for the sake 
of argument, let’s rally.
Roland Thorn-
qvist’s squad re-cently won its second straight 
national title in 
dominating fash-ion, a 4-0 victory 
against top-seeded UCLA. In fact, the Gators didn’t allow a team point in 20 of 
their 28 matches. How can you say no to 
that much love?
Joe: I cannot deny the greatness of 
coach Thornqvist’s tennis squad. The 
Gators were dominant this season in their run to the a second consecutive national 
title. But did they win two championships in 91 days? In the words of @NotGreg-
Luca, what the UF men’s track and ﬁ  eld 
team accomplished this season is “out of its gourd.”
The last team to win both the indoor 
and outdoor national championships in a single season was Arkansas in 2003. Flor-ida is one of just six programs to ever ac-complish this feat. What this group of guys managed to achieve in 2012 is beyond or-
dinary. To quote @NotGregLuca again, it 
was “bonkers.”
  Corey: I don’t believe its possible to 
win two championships in one year in any 
sport other than track. Either way you look 
Which Gators team was the absolute, uncontested best in 2011-12?

 HOOVER, Ala. — The second year has been 
a signiﬁ  cant one for past Gators coaches.
  Steve Spurrier won Florida’s ﬁ  rst Southeast-
ern Conference title. Charley Pell oversaw an 
eight-win improvement in 1980 after the worst season in UF history. Urban Meyer hoisted the crystal football above his head at the conclu-
sion of the 2006 campaign.
  Despite expectations from history, Will Mus-
champ says he feels the same as he did when he 
ﬁ  rst took the job in 2011.
  “Well, no more pressure at all,” Muschamp 
said last Wednesday.
“The pressure is what you put on yourself, 
and I put an awful lot on myself whether it’s year one or year 10.”
  When Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley 
hired Muschamp, the former defensive coordi-nator was already a household name in college football. Named the head-coach-in-waiting at Texas in 2008, Muschamp was known for his 
rambunctious sideline demeanor and his na-
tionally ranked defenses.
  In eight years as a Division-I defensive co-
ordinator, Muschamp-led units surrendered 
285.18 yards per game and have ranked in the 
Top 10 in total defense six times.
However, his behavior during games be-
came his trademark.
  Muschamp would head butt his players, 
jump into their arms and yell continuously during football games.
He even began bleeding from his ear during 
a 52-10 Texas win against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 30, 2008.
  When he accepted the UF job, Muschamp 
said he had no plans to change his coaching style.
  “I’m going to be me, I’m going to be Will 
Muschamp,” he said at his introductory press conference last December.
“The players are a reﬂ  ection of their coach 
and I hope they feed off the intensity that we try to bring to the game.”
  Muschamp’s animated side shined through 
multiple times during his inaugural campaign with the Gators.
  Perhaps his most memorable display came 
in a 17-6 loss at Auburn on Oct. 15. Punt return-er Chris Rainey signaled for a fair catch right 
before a Tigers defender made contact, which 
resulted in a muff and an Auburn ﬁ  rst down on the UF 32-yard line.
  After the play, ESPN cameras and micro-
phones caught footage of Muschamp’s expletive-ﬁ  lled rant directed at the back judge. Muschamp 
apologized three days later.
  While Muschamp cleaned up his language, 
he maintained his intensity and even referred to his team as “soft” after a 21-7 loss to Florida State on Nov. 26, 2011.
  Redshirt senior linebacker/defensive end 
Lerentee McCray believes that Muschamp may tone down his act, but that the ﬁ  ery coach would not change too much.
  “He is going to bring a lot of ‘Rah, rah!’ A lot 
of energy and a lot of passion to the game,” Mc-Cray said. “You can see it from the sidelines. I think he does a better job of controlling it now, so this year you won’t see as much of that. But 
that’s him. That’s his energy so it’s going to 
happen.”
  Muschamp’s players believe he has the pas-
sion to succeed. The goal for the second-year Muschamp preparing for second year

Ryan Lochte has been building toward the 
London Games since he walked away from Bei-
jing dissatisfied four years ago.
His results — two gold medals, two bronze, 
a couple of world records and the first indi-vidual title of his Olympic career — would be 
more than enough for most swimmers.
Not for the surfer dude from Daytona Beach, 
Fla.
Lochte believed he was capable of so much 
more, saying, “I wanted to get faster.” So he 
changed his diet — out with his favorite candy 
and sugary sodas — and intensified his training in and out of the water. Inspired by watching 
Strongman competitions on television, he in-
corporated throwing tires and dragging heavy chains into his routine. The results started com-
ing.
Last summer, Lochte won five golds, one 
bronze and set the first world record since high-tech body suits were banned over eight days at 
the world championships. Most notably, he beat Michael Phelps in both their matchups.
But Lochte didn’t see himself as the top dog. 
Mentally, he cast himself as the underdog, a role he’s known well while swimming in the 
Phelps era.
“I knock myself down to the bottom of the 
totem pole,” Lochte said at the time.
He spent the past year building himself back up to the top.
Phelps was already there, having rededi-
cated himself since last summer.
“He will always be there no matter what,’” 
Lochte said.
The swimmer with 14 Olympic gold med-
als — including eight from his historic perfor -
mance in Beijing — beat Lochte in three of four 
events at the U.S. trials last month.
Lochte readily acknowledges Phelps as “the 
world’s best swimmer ever.” Yet he’s not intim-
idated by the man he once lost 17 straight races 
against in the 200-meter individual medley.
“I always feel like I can win everything. It’s 
just how my mind works,” said Lochte, com-peting in his third Olympics. “I know I can win and I know I can swim multiple events back-to-
back and I think that’s what keeps me going.”
The Lochte-Phelps rivalry, so compelling at 
the U.S. trials when they were separated by a few ticks of the clock, will surely be one of the 
highlights of the London Games.
“Because of what they have accomplished 
there has never been this much exposure for swimming,” said U.S. Olympian Tyler Clary, who often competes against the two stars. 
“They push the best out of each other every 
time they get in the pool.”
They’ll swim against each other twice: in the 
200 and 400 individual medleys. The 400 IM comes up on the first day of competition next Saturday.
“I don’t want him to win. He doesn’t want me to win,” Phelps said. “It’s kind of like when 
we step on the pool deck, that’s our field, our 
battlefield, and we do everything we can to try to get our hands on the wall first.”
Phelps’ coach, Bob Bowman, questions how 
much the rivalry fuels Phelps.
“The main competition is himself. I think 
he’s spurred on by having people to race, I think he likes that,” Bowman said. “But I think the primary measure of success is did he hit the time he wanted to hit.”
Lochte isn’t caught up in what Phelps is do-
ing in or out of the pool.
“I’m lost in my own 
world and I just stay there,” he said.
Lochte’s world is as col-
orful as Phelps’ is strictly regimented. Lochte’s idea 
of fun away from the pool 
involves skateboarding off 
ramps, surfing and riding 
scooters. In his only nod to a more sedate life, 
he draws.
Typically, Lochte arrives at major meets 
with tales of a recent injury from his adven-tures on wheels. Phelps’ favorite pursuits are 
golf and poker.
Lochte is outgoing and actively engages his 
fans on Twitter. His tanned, chiseled body and formerly floppy hair draw lusty comments from women young and old. He hates disappointing 
anyone seeking an autograph or photo. Even if his generous instincts irk coach Gregg Troy.
At the U.S. trials, Lochte stopped early in the 
meet to chat with reporters instead of moving 
quickly to the warmdown pool. Troy appeared 
and hissed at his star before yanking him away 
by the arm.
“It’s a little bit of a weakness,” Troy said. 
“He has to learn to say no once in a while.”
Phelps is the guarded, gawked-at superstar 
who never moves about alone. He’s in his own world in the pre-race ready room, ear buds 
pumping music and his eyes in a steely gaze. 
Lochte saves his favorite rap music for later and often walks out smiling.
“If I win, I win,” he said. “If I don’t, I don’t. 
It’s not the end of the world.”
During downtime at the Olympic village, 
Phelps and Lochte partner for ultra-competitive games of spades, where their shared penchant for high risk means they win big or lose badly.
“We still take it to Ricky Berens and Cullen 
Jones all the time and we have to keep that tra-dition,” Lochte said.
Phelps insists London is his farewell meet, 
having long ago vowed he would not swim past 30. He’s 27 and Lochte turns 28 on Aug. 3 
— the next-to-last day of swimming. Lochte has 
already said he will keep going to 2016.
“I told myself I’ll quit swimming once I stop 
having fun and right now I’m having a blast,” he said. “I’m not thinking about the money or medals or anything else, I’m just having fun 
racing.”�PLAYERS CAN TRANSFER 
WITHOUT PENALTY, WINS 
VACATED FROM 1998-2011
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
STATE COLLEGE, Pa.  — The 
NCAA crippled Penn State football 
for years to come and practically tore Joe Paterno’s name out of the record 
books Monday, erasing 14 years of 
victories and imposing an unprec-edented $60 million fine and other 
punishment over the child sexual 
abuse scandal.
“Football will never again be 
placed ahead of educating, nurtur -
ing and protecting young people,” NCAA President Mark Emmert de-
clared in announcing the penalties.
The governing body of college 
sports shredded what was left of the Hall of Fame coach’s legacy — the 
sanctions cost Paterno 111 wins and his standing as the most success-ful coach in the history of big-time 
college football — while dealing a 
severe blow to the university’s gold-plated gridiron program.
The NCAA ordered Penn State to 
sit out the postseason for four years, slashed the number of scholarships 
it can award and placed football on 
probation, all of which will make it difficult for the Nittany Lions to com-
pete at the sport’s highest level.
Raising the specter of an exodus 
of athletes, the NCAA said current or incoming football players at Penn 
State are free to immediately transfer and compete at another school.
Penn State meekly accepted its 
punishment, pledging to hold itself to high standards of honesty and in-tegrity.
Emmert said the penalties reflect 
“the magnitude of these terrible acts” and also “ensure that Penn State will 
rebuild an athletic culture that went horribly awry.”
He said the NCAA considered 
imposing the “death penalty,” or a 
complete shutdown of the football 
program for a season or more, but 
decided to keep Penn State in the fold so that it could begin transform-
ing a culture in which football played 
an outsized role. The NCAA also worried about the unintended conse-
quences of a complete ban, he said.
First-year coach Bill O’Brien, who 
was hired to replace Paterno, will 
have the daunting task of luring new 
recruits while trying to keep current 
players from fleeing the program. Star players such as tailback Silas 
Redd and linebacker Gerald Hodges 
are now essentially free agents.
“I knew when I accepted the posi-
tion that there would be tough times ahead,” O’Brien said. “But I am com-mitted for the long term to Penn State 
and our student athletes.”
Separately, the Big Ten an-
nounced that Penn State will not be allowed to share in the conference’s 
bowl revenue during the NCAA’s postseason ban, an estimated loss of about $13 million.
Emmert fast-tracked the penalties 
rather than go through the usual cir -cuitous series of investigations and 
hearings. The NCAA said the $60 mil-
lion is equivalent to the annual gross revenue of the football program. The 
money will go toward outside pro-
grams devoted to preventing child sexual abuse or assisting victims.
Penn State said it will pay the fine 
in five annual installments of $12 mil-lion but did not disclose where it will 
get the cash. The governor demand-
ed assurances from Penn State that taxpayer money will not be used to pay the fine, while the NCAA insist-
ed the university maintain spending 
on other sports and scholarships.By throwing out all Penn State vic-
tories from 1998 to 2011, the NCAA stripped Paterno of the top spot in the record book. The governing body 
went all the way back to 1998 be-
cause, according to the investigative report, that is the year Paterno and 
other Penn State officials first learned 
of an allegation against Sandusky.
Former Florida State coach Bobby 
Bowden will replace Paterno with 377 major-college victories, while Pa-terno will be credited with 298.
“I didn’t want it to happen like 
this,” Bowden said. “Wish I could have earned it.”
Penn State will also lose 20 schol-
arships a year for four years. Major college football programs are nor -
mally allowed 85 scholarship players 
per year.
The postseason ban is the lon-
gest handed out by the NCAA since it gave a four-year punishment to 
Indiana football in 1960. Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany said that 
Penn State players will probably be 
allowed to transfer within the con-ference, something that is usually 
restricted.
The news devastated senior Ni-
cole Lord, who questioned why Penn State’s student body, and especially 
its student athletes, should be pun-ished “for the wrongs of three men 
and a monster.”
“They keep breaking our hearts 
and breaking our hearts and break-ing our hearts,” she said.
“Our heritage, our legacy has 
been tainted and damaged,” said Troy Cromwell, a wide receiver on 
the 1986 team that won the second of Paterno’s two national champion-
ships. Cromwell said he felt bad for 
current and incoming players, “but at the end of the day, there were still 
those kids, those poor kids, and those 
victims, and we have to think about them first in everything that we do.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 24, 2012

THE OLYMPICS
Former Gator Lochte engaged in friendly rivalry with Phelpscoach is — as he said when ﬁ  rst hired — to have his 
players feed off the energy.
  In order to reach that goal, senior linebacker Jon 
Bostic says it will require a change on the players’ part more than Muschamp.
  “He has stressed the same type of things,” Bostic 
said. “We see it on ﬁ  lm and it is exactly what he 
stressed. It’s making the right block and everybody 
knowing their assignment.”
  With a year of experience under his belt, Mus-
champ is better prepared to compete in the SEC. Losses from last season’s team may make life difﬁ  -cult for Muschamp in 2012, but senior running back 
Mike Gillislee sees a more conﬁ  dent man wearing 
the headset.
  “I feel like he is in the mindset of what he has 
to do and what we have to accomplish now to win football games,” Gillislee said. “That is being physi-cally and mentally tough.”

 Top-10 forward Chris Walker 
(Bonifay, Fla.) announced Sun-
day morning his commitment to 
coach Billy Donovan and Flori-
da.
  Walker joins AAU teammate 
and point guard Kasey Hill as the 
lone UF 2013 commitments.
With Walker in the fold, the 
Gators now boast the top 2013 re-
cruiting class according to ESPN.com.
  The 6-foot-9 forward revealed 
his future destination via a Home Team Hoops mixtape video on-line, which featured his dunk-heavy highlight reel and a bold prediction.
   “I will be teaming up with 
my teammate off the AAU squad Kasey Hill and together we will be the best duo in college, and we will win a national champion-
ship. You heard it here ﬁ  rst,” he 
said.
  Walker and Hill, the No. 6 and 
No. 7 overall prospects on Rivals.
com, respectively, are the high-
est-ranked Florida commitments for Donovan since Brad Beal at No. 4 in 2011.
  When the duo arrives in 2013, the Gators roster will be with-out All-Southeastern Conference shooting guard Kenny Boynton 
and  forward Erik Murphy due to 
graduation.
  That will leave forwards Cody 
Larson, Will Yeguete and Patric 
Y o u n g 
as the 
only big men on 
the roster with any minutes at 
Florida barring transfers or early 
departures.
Young, a projected NBA ﬁ  rst-
round pick, could leave after his junior season.  Center Damontre Harris, from 
South Carolina, and forward Dorian Finney-Smith, from Vir-
ginia Tech, transferred to Florida 
earlier this summer and become eligible in 2013.
  Harris, an All-SEC defensive 
team member, tied for second in 
the SEC with 2.3 blocks per game 
in 2011-12.
  The 6-foot-10, 228-pound cen-
ter averaged 10.5 points, 7.5 re-
bounds and three blocks in two 
games vs. Florida last season.
  Finney-Smith left Virginia 
Tech after the school ﬁ  red coach Seth Greenberg. He started 30 of 33 games and earned a spot on the Atlantic Coast Conference All-Freshmen team. The honored 
squad included NBA ﬁ  rst-round 
selection Austin Rivers, Duke’s point guard last season.
  The potential pairing of Har-
ris, Finney-Smith and Walker 
gives the Gators a lengthy front-
court, which Florida could use after missing out on several for-wards in 2012.
  Donovan and his staff court-
ed prospects Anthony Bennett, Mitch McGary, Nerlens Noel and Alex Poythress, but all chose dif-ferent schools.

7-6: Will Muschamp’s record in his ﬁ  rst season at Florida.  This 
is the worst record for a ﬁ  rst-year coach at Florida since Charley Pell took over the Gators in 1979 and went 0-10-1. In their ﬁ  rst seasons at UF, Steve Spurrier went 9-2, Ron Zook went 8-5 and Urban Meyer went 9-3.
3-5: Muschamp’s record against SEC teams. In Southeastern 
Conference play, Muschamp only beat Tennessee, Kentucky and Vanderbilt, while dropping games to Alabama, LSU, Auburn, Georgia and South Carolina.
0: Number of wins Muschamp had against Top 25 teams 
in 2011. The Gators peaked in the rankings at No. 12 after defeating Kentucky to start the season 4-0, but fell out of the rankings for good after blowout losses to Alabama and LSU in 
consecutive weeks.
3: Florida ﬁ  nished third in the SEC East in 2011 behind Georgia 
and South Carolina. A 3-5 record would have put the Gators in ﬁ  fth place if they played in the SEC West.
9: UF ranked ninth nationally in total defense last season with 
299.58 yards per game. Fellow SEC members Alabama, LSU, Georgia and South Carolina were the top four nationally.
113: Florida’s national ranking in turnovers. The Gators only 
managed 14 takeaways while losing 26. UF recovered six fumbles and intercepted eight passes, while losing 13 fumbles 
and throwing 13 interceptions.

ing the 2010 Florida Relays held on April 3, 2010.
at it, both teams proved they were 
the best week in week out. The only difference — besides track having 
the extra championship — is the ten-
nis squad had fewer faults on their record.
They won the Southeastern Con-
ference regular-season title with a perfect 11-0 conference record, fol-lowed by taking the SEC Tourna-ment by force, dropping only one team point in three matches. By the 
time they were hoisting the hard-
ware, their record stood at 27-1.
As I recall, the men’s track squad 
failed to win the SEC Championship 
in both Indoor and Outdoor. They 
may have proved they were the best in the nation when it mattered, but we are talking about best team of the year. That includes everything 
before the championship, even prac-
tice (ahem, Allen Iverson).
Joe: Oh, you were finished? Well, 
allow me to retort. What does Mar -
cellus Wallace look like? — Okay, sorry. I just watched “Pulp Fiction” for the 100th time the other day. Here is what we are looking at right now. The men’s track and field team won its third consecutive indoor na-tional title in March. Then, against 
seemingly insurmountable odds, the 
Gators clinched the NCAA outdoor crown. Why was this feat so incred-ible?
First, I will mention the mental 
obstacle. During the three previous seasons, Florida had fallen a com-bined five points short of first place. Needing a victory in the men’s 
4x400 relay to clinch the national 
championship, the Tony McQuay-led Gators won the event in 3:00.02 to edge LSU by two points in the fi-nal standings.
Even more impressive than de-
livering in a must-win scenario was how a shorthanded UF won in Des Moines, Iowa. Florida competed 
without All-Americans decathlete 
Gray Horn (suspension) and sprint-er Jeff Demps (hamstring). With the pressure of past failures and the ab-sence of two key team members, the 
Gators delivered. #FedEx
Corey: Well, damn. You had me 
leaning on your side for a moment 
there, but then I remembered the topic we are discussing: best team of 2011-2012. What you so eloquently described takes the cake when it comes to best single performance 
— it certainly doesn’t hurt your ar -
gument, but it isn’t the breaking 
point either. Besides, I can’t help remembering those failures in the SEC Championships  — not once, 
but twice.
On the other hand, the ten-
nis squad had only one error — a 
third-week loss to second-ranked 
Stanford. From that point on, they 
played 100 days of unbeaten tennis against 22 teams, 14 of which were ranked in the top 30.
No, they didn’t have that inspir -
ing performance, winning against all odds, overcoming mental hur -
tles. Instead, the national champi-ons dominated from day one, never 
looking back. I believe that is what 
made the “Dream Team,” the “John Carter” of basketball. 
Joe: Now, now. Everybody knows 
the true “Dream Team” is this year’s 
squad. Just ask Kobe.
