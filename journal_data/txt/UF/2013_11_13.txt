UF professor Mike Foley interviews Vince Gilligan, the creator of AMC’s hit series “Breaking Bad,” at an event hosted 
by Accent Speaker’s Bureau at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday evening.

Vince Gilligan, creator of the hit tele-
vision series “Breaking Bad,” said he 
never took chemistry in high school — but that didn’t stop him from creating meth-dealing chemistry teacher Walter White.
Gilligan, who was interviewed by 
UF journalism college master lecturer Mike Foley, spoke to a packed Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Tues-day night. 
Accent Speaker’s Bureau paid Gilli-
gan $60,000 to talk about his own back-ground as an aspiring moviemaker in his younger years to the creative pro-cesses behind the curtains of “Breaking Bad.”
Foley began the discussion with a 
spoiler alert, warning the crowd that anything in the show was fair game for discussion, and if anyone hadn’t ﬁ  n-ished the show, it was his or her fault.
“To me, ‘Breaking Bad’ feels like 
catching lightning in a bottle,” Gilligan told the crowd. “I don’t know how I’d do it again.”
He said his fascination with the 
“Breaking Bad” story came from the protagonist Walter White’s transforma-tion from a plain, boring “Mr. Chips” type of character to a more eccentric “Scarface.”
“I think all of us have a good side 
and a dark side,” he said.
Gilligan said he drew inspiration 
from television shows like “The Wire,” “The Shield” and “The Sopranos,” even drawing a comparison between his Wal-ter White and Barney Fife of “The Andy Grifﬁ  th Show.” Both harbor an amaz-ingly detailed inner life, but they also carry with them damaged self-esteem and psyches.
He said he ﬁ  rst worked with Bry-
an Cranston, the actor behind Walter White, for a few days on the set of “The X-Files.”

With almost two months left until Pedro 
Bravo’s defense team is supposed to ﬁ  nish 
collecting depositions, the lead attorney told an Alachua County judge on Tuesday afternoon that he needed more time.
Michael Ruppert, who represents Bravo 
in his ongoing murder case, said during a case management hearing at the Alachua County Courthouse that he planned to ﬁ  le a written motion to extend the Jan. 14 dead-line so he and his team could interview ad-ditional witnesses scheduled for later that month.
“We have a slew of depositions in Janu-
ary,” he said.
State prosecutors objected the motion. 
Judge Robert K. Groeb, who will replace Judge Denise Ferrero in overseeing the case in 2014, will review it and make a decision, said State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Darry Lloyd.
Bravo, the 20-year-old former Santa Fe 
College student accused of kidnapping and murdering UF student Christian Aguilar, has already appeared in court a half-dozen times since 2012.
On Tuesday, he emerged from a side 
door in the courtroom, handcuffed and wearing a red jumpsuit. He glanced at a group of people, including his parents, sit-ting behind him.
Aguilar’s family and several support-
ers, who drove more than four hours from Miami, wore white “Justice for Christian” T-shirts and sat quietly on the opposite side Pedro Bravo’s 
lawyer to request later deadline

As the Student Senate moved forward sup-
porting a resolution granting in-state tuition to undocumented students, Student Govern-
ment, External Affairs and the Collegiate Vet-erans Society pushed for a similar cause.
UF administrators and student veterans 
from UF and Santa Fe College attended an event supporting in-state tuition for nonresi-dent veterans held at Pugh Hall on Tuesday night.
So far, 20 states have laws granting veter-
ans in-state tuition, according to Student Vet-erans of America’s website. Eight states have a university system for in-state residency for veterans, and 10 states have pending legisla-tion, including Florida.
Two bills were introduced into the Florida 
Senate and Florida House of Representatives in September in favor of a one-year residency waiver to veterans only.

Santa Fe College’s Visual Arts 
Faculty Gallery will open once again 
Friday night, aimed at giving students insight into the artistic process.
The 22nd annual gallery opening, which will last from 7 to 9 p.m., will be held at the Santa Fe Gallery on the SFC campus.  
It will showcase a variety of art 
displays created by SFC faculty, many of whom are practicing artists in Gainesville.
The event will include catered food and live music. 
Admission is free and open to the 
public. People can visit through Jan. 16, according to a news release.
The exhibition will focus on 
teaching students about the process of how the art was created, said Kyle Novak, gallery manager. 
It will also show students the 
inspiration behind the designs, he said.
“For students, it’s important to 
see work in all different stages of development,” Novak said. “We view ourselves quite literally as an extension of the classroom, which is what makes us different.”
Some students from both UF 
and SFC are eager to learn from the experiences of the artists.
Sara Moseley, a 21-year-old SFC 
graduate, said interactions with the artists, who will be at the gallery to explain their pieces, can be valuable.
“They’re teaching you how to hone 
your talents, and you’re learning from these people all semester,” Moseley said.  “It’s a good way to nonverbally absorb their teachings through their work.”WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

� MARSHALL CRISER WON’T FAVOR UF.
JULIA GLUM

A Gator will likely soon help lead the State 
University System.
Marshall Criser III, the son of the former 
UF president Criser Hall is named after, was 
chosen Tuesday as a Board of Governors search committee’s finalist for chancellor. Cri-ser, president of AT&T Florida, has served on UF’s Board of Trustees since 2010.
The chancellor is the chief executive and 
administrative officer of the Board of Gover-nors, according to its website.
Criser’s experience and ideas make him 
“the perfect fit to be our chancellor,” com-mittee vice chair Tom Kuntz said in a news release.
In his interview, Criser mentioned increas-
ing communication between the board and university trustees. 
Criser stressed he’d make decisions by 
looking at what’s best for Florida — not favor UF, despite his history with the university.
“The types of things that I wake up in 
the morning and go to bed at night thinking through — I shouldn’t say this in a public meeting — but a lot of times, they’re focused on where the opportunity is in higher educa-tion in the state,” he said.
The board will consider Criser’s appoint-
ment at its meeting next week.University 
system may get Gator chancellor
“For students, it’s important 
to see work in all different

view ourselves quite literally as 
an extension of the classroom, 
which is what makes us 
different.”
Kyle Novak
gallery managerOut of all the talented ac-
tors he met during the show’s 
nine years on air, he said Cr-anston stood out the most.
“He’s the greatest guy 
ever,” he said. “He’s such a chameleon.”
Foley asked Gilligan if he 
had ever tried methamphet-amines, to which Gilligan re-plied no — “I think I’d be a heroin guy, myself,” he said.
Before beginning the Q-
and-A session, Foley gave a cautionary statement so the crowd would remain calm.“We will tase you,” he 
said.
Chris Kirschner, a 21-year-
old UF journalism senior, said it was great that Gilli-gan appeared to talk about the creative mindset behind “Breaking Bad.”
Kirschner said learning 
how Gilligan went about making such a successful show was a great experi-ence.
“I don’t think any show 
can be fairly compared to ‘Breaking Bad’,” Kirschner said. “It’s the perfect show.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2013

Gainesville’s 10-year plan to end 
homelessness is entering the home 
stretch.
On Tuesday, the city will acquire 
the former Gainesville Correctional Institution to convert it into a center for the disadvantaged.  
“This site is really the capstone of 
that plan,” said city spokesman Bob Woods.
Gainesville paid $1.3 million for the 30.85-acre property, 2845 NE 39th Ave., according to a city news release.
The center, which doesn’t have 
an opening date set yet, will start with at least four buildings in use. One will be a kitchen and dining room, one will be a dormitory, one will house administrative offices, and the fourth will be a laundry facility, Woods said. The property includes access roads, a parking lot and other buildings that may be converted after a more concrete plan is established.
The plan was launched eight 
years ago, Woods said. Much of the work completed since 2005 involved research and coordinating city and county efforts.
“Our biggest issue, frankly, has 
been finding a site to provide a full range of services,” Woods said.
On Oct. 31, the city issued a re-
quest for proposal for potential ven-dors to outline how they plan to use the center.  
Ideas range from community gar-
dens to job training to mental health services and even storage facilities. The center will serve not only those who are homeless, but also those who are hungry.
Woods said volunteers have 
done some work on the site such as repairing cracks and stabilizing buildings. Further renovations will depend on the requirements of the winning proposal.
Critics of the site believe it is too far away from city life to be practical. Critic Annette Gilley is a member of Occupy Gainesville, which focuses on homelessness.
“We don’t have a homeless prob-
lem so much as we have a homeless visibility problem,” she said in an interview last month.
Although the center is a former 
correctional facility, Woods said it will be an open campus. He said the center doesn’t have a name yet, but the working title is the Empower-ment Center.
“That word, ‘empowerment,’ 
says it all. That’s really the goal for this center,” he said.

UF is No. 1 in the nation for bone marrow donor reg-
istration.
The top-ranking drive was the result of a partnership 
between the Gift of Life Bone Marrow Foundation and 
Footprints, a pediatric oncology volunteer group.
Rachel Werk, 20-year-old UF behavior and cognitive 
neuroscience junior and co-director of the drive, said her organization registered 1,338 donors, breaking the re-cord of 1,118 donors set by Syracuse University in 2007.
“The ability to go above and beyond that is really 
great,” she said.
Werk attributes the higher number to better organi-
zation and the huge turnout of volunteers. More than 200 students helped register and swab potential donors during the two-day drive.
“We had so many volunteers that we had to open up 
two more locations at the last minute,” she said.
Shayne Pilpel, 43, the recruitment coordinator for the 
foundation, said UF has run 18 drives since 2010 for a grand total of 4,480 individual donors.
This is incredible, he said, in comparison to the clos-
est competitor. Ohio University has run 105 drives since 2007, but their donor total is only 5,344.
UF has registered the most individual donors at a 
single drive, but Pilpel said UF has also registered the most donors so far this year.
“When you have a group of students like Footprints 
who are working in association with Shands, you have a group of people who truly understand the importance of what we’re doing,” he said. “It’s amazing what they do.”Bone marrow drive grows stronger

A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 14 
of the room during the brief 
hearing.
More than a year after Bra-
vo’s arrest, a trial date has yet to be set.
Although Tuesday’s hear-
ing resulted in another delay, Carlos Aguilar, Christian Agu-ilar’s father, said he and his family is frustrated with the case’s slow pace as it moves into 2014.
“I understand this is part 
of the system. We don’t want appeal after appeal,” he said. “Nothing is going to bring Christian back, but I’ll still be looking for justice.”
David Kiliszek, Carlos Agu-ilar’s 31-year-old cousin from Broward County, agreed.
“It’s overwhelming … when 
all the defense is telling you is that they need more time,” he said.
Bravo’s next case manage-
ment hearing is scheduled for Jan. 14.
Aguilar, an 18-year-old UF biomedical engineering freshman, was reported miss-ing Sept. 20, 2012. A month later, two hunters found his half-buried body in a wooded area 40 miles southwest of Gainesville.
Gainesville Police arrested 
Bravo four days after Aguilar’s disappearance. Bravo has since been charged with kidnap-ping, homicide, lying to police, providing false reports, mis-handling human remains, tam-pering with physical evidence, and poisoning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person, according to court records.
He remains in custody at 
the Alachua County Jail.

UF did not make it onto Best Colleges for Veterans rankings 
event.
“Their dedication to ensuring all 50 states are kept safe is 
reason enough to allow our vets to be eligible for in-state tu-
ition,” she said.
Vice President for Student Affairs Dave Kratzer, who served 
as a general in the military, expressed his support for the bill.Close to 500 UF student veterans are currently on the GI Bill and another 180 are dependents who receive benefits from the GI Bill, he said.“We need to make sure this gets done for Florida this year,” 
Kratzer said. “It’s simply the right thing to do.”
The event follows the release of U.S. News and World Re-
port’s inaugural Best Colleges for Veterans rankings.
Analysts matched top-ranked schools in the Best Colleges 
ranking with those colleges that are members of the Service-members Opportunity Colleges Consortium, certified for the GI Bill and participants in the Yellow Ribbon Program. The list was broken down into national universities, liberal arts col-leges, regional universities and regional colleges. UF made no appearance in any of the categories, neither the national level nor the regional level.John Gebhardt, veterans advocate at SFC and UF, would 
not comment on UF not making it into the rankings.
“It’s not because we don’t do the job, that’s for sure,” he 
said. “In fact, we have the Veterans Success Center now, one of the premiere centers in the state. We have all the elements to be in the top ranking.”
Along with Gebhardt, former president of Collegiate Veter-
ans Society Michael Filipelli heralded the Collegiate Veterans Success Center, located in Yon Hall.
“That’s where you find your true bonding with the other 
vets,” he said. “It brought together a centralized location for people.”VEtErAN , from page 1“I understand this is

A stacked agenda complete with a hot-button issue 
complemented a full house in the Student Senate cham-
bers Tuesday night.
The Senate’s ﬁ  rst Bring a Constituent to Senate Day left many without a seat at the meeting. 
But the constituent overﬂ  ow included those who 
were advocating for a resolution in support of tuition equity for undocumented students, up for its ﬁ  rst read-ing.
In Florida, undocumented students pay out-of-state 
tuition, which costs about four times as much as in-state tuition. 
Although resolutions do not change legislation, if 
this one passes, it would be sent to state leaders, ex-pressing the Senate’s support of a law granting undocu-mented students the right to in-state tuition.
The resolution, authored by Students for a Demo-
cratic Society lead organizer Conor Munro, Gators for Tuition Equity founder Liana Guerra and Sen. Joselin Padron-Rasines, was sponsored by Senate President Cory Yeffet.
“We think students who worked hard in high school 
and earned their spot in The Gator Nation shouldn’t be kept from doing this,” Munro said.
Representatives from Hispanic Students Associa-
tion, Black Student Union and Asian American Student Union among 15 other organizations also spoke at the podium in support of the resolution.
Some senators believed the chambers were not an 
appropriate venue for the bill.
“We cannot speak for every student at the univer-
sity,” said Sen. Michael Christ. “This is an issue with a diversity of opinion.”
After a majority vote, the resolution sailed onto 
its second reading to be debated next week. Padron-Rasines and Liana Guerra hugged in triumph.
Padron-Rasines thanked those who supported the 
resolution.
“We are going to rally this in Tallahassee in the 
Spring,” she said. “And I know that students will be appreciative of your support with this.”Student Senate supports tuition equity

Just in time for the holidays, Amazon and the U.S. 
Postal Service are partnering to offer Sunday pack-
age delivery to customers in two cities beginning this week.
The deal will ﬁ  rst begin in Los Angeles and New 
York. The two companies will decide where to ex-pand in upcoming years, said Stephen Seewoester, spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service.
“It’s great because a lot of times people might not 
order something on a Friday because they won’t get it until the upcoming week,” he said.
The new Sunday delivery option will not cost extra  
to customers, he said.
Jay Pierre, a 19-year-old UF political science soph-
omore, said he thinks the idea is a good business move.
“The post ofﬁ  ces were just about to stop delivering 
mail on Saturdays, and now they’re starting up busi-ness on Sundays?” he said. “The U.S. Postal Service is really winning with Amazon right now.”
Shanice Kate, an 18-year-old UF recreation, parks 
and tourism sophomore, said she thinks Sunday de-livery would be too much.
“They should take advice from Chick-ﬁ  l-A,” she 
said. “Sundays need to be left alone. The weekend is called weekend for a reason.”Sunday Amazon

for drop in sexual 
health rankings
Yesterday, the Alligator reported that UF dropped three 
slots in the 2013 Trojan Sexual Health Report Card from No. 12 in 2012 to No. 15 this year.
In the article, the president of UF’s branch of Vox: Voices for 
Planned Parenthood, mentioned sex-ed policies in schools.
“There’s a lot of ignorance in our age group about sexual 
health, but it isn’t really our fault,” she said. “Florida teenagers are entering adulthood without any practical knowledge of their own anatomy or bodily functions.”
Although UF offers a number of sexual-health resources, the 
crux of the problem lies in Florida schools’ faulty, disjointed sex-ed programs.
According to ABC Action News, “In 2012, the CDC released 
startling statistics about Florida teens. There were 682 reported cases of HIV, more than 27,000 STD cases in general, and almost 16,000 babies born to teenagers.”

that’s currently available in 32 school districts in Florida, and if it receives grant funds, county ofﬁ  cials are looking to improve their sex-ed structure. The grant would provide teachers “ex-tensive training in comprehensive sexuality and explain how to implement it in school.”
Although this may seem like a step forward, the grant would 
still promote abstinence education, which has been proven inef-fective.
PolicyMic.com reported, “Studies show that conservative 
states, due to other factors such as religious and moral beliefs, are most likely to implement abstinence-only sex education in schools. Ironically, it is these states that suffer the highest rate of teen pregnancies and STD infection.”
“Stanger-Hall and Hall discovered that the states with the 
lowest teen pregnancy rates institute ‘abstinence-plus’ sex edu-cation, ensuring that abstinence and information about sexual health and contraceptives are both covered,” PolicyMic stated.
Young adults need comprehensive sex education — not the 
“Mean Girls” don’t-have-sex-because-you-WILL-get-pregnant-and-die abstinence-only drivel. It doesn’t work, and it doesn’t prepare high school kids for college, where morals are a little looser and casual sex is commonplace.
To be sure, abstinence education isn’t a bad thing — after all, 
abstinence is the only birth-control method with a 100-percent-guaranteed success rate. Abstinence is a personal choice many people choose to make, and that’s perfectly ﬁ  ne.
But not everyone wants to abstain, and those young adults 
who want to become sexually active should have access to edu-cational resources. According to Planned Parenthood, Florida doesn’t have any statewide standards for sex education, while 78 percent of Floridians support comprehensive sex education.
Sex education shouldn’t be driven by a political agenda, and 
it should be accessible to high school kids across the state. If Florida doesn’t implement a standardized sex-ed program, rates of teen pregnancies and STDs will remain stalemate at best or continue to climb at worst.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Do you pay 
attention to what times you drink coffee? Today’s question: Do you think undocumented 
students should pay in-state tuition rates?Instead of death, fear the unlived life
As I age into my early 20s, I realize now that over-
used cliches are not as useless as their unorigi-nality might suggest. Take this one: “All that is 
necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.”
To elaborate, let us consider a chilling incident that 
occurred in New York City in 2010. One night in April, an assailant stalked and attacked an innocent woman. Luckily for her, someone was there to help.
A homeless man jumped to the aid of the woman. The 
hero himself was then stabbed by the assailant and fell to the sidewalk. Nearly 25 people indifferently walked past the injured man in the next hour. One bystander even pulled out his phone to take a picture of the face-down body before leaving. No one seemed to care about the growing pool of blood.
By the time ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters arrived on scene an hour and 
20 minutes later, the homeless man had died.  
Such cruel apathy is well-documented. The most fa-
mous example of the “bystander effect” is that of Kitty Genovese, who was attacked near her New York apart-ment by a serial murderer. Her screams and calls for help were heard by neighbors, but no one intervened. The Genovese murder took place nearly 50 years ago.
You can partly blame the “diffusion of responsibil-
ity” that we delude ourselves into thinking, the notion that since there are so many people out there, someone else will take action. But that’s not the full story.
Today, the default state of mind is indifference. Sure, 
the apathy we identify ourselves with doesn’t translate to ignoring bleeding victims on sidewalks, but it is still dangerous.
Each of us has selﬁ  sh instincts. Naturally, the urge 
to pay attention to the individual self is the top priority for everyone. The problem begins when the top priority becomes the only priority.
The amount of peace and justice is inversely pro-portional to the level of apathy people have. The luxuries of freedom and law in the United States we enjoy today are pre-cisely because of the relentless struggle of people whose names history books never mention.  
Spending a few semesters 
ﬁ  ghting Student Government 
corruption won’t beef up your resume. Protesting the poverty endured by those working for minimum wage won’t win you any awards. Devoting your life to the eradication of nuclear weapons can seem like a grand waste of time.
But, ultimately, is that not life? After the booze runs dry and we look back at our col-
lege years, little contentment will come from remember-ing the epic Midtown parties. 
As corny as this sounds, our years will be deﬁ  ned by 
how much our humanity blossomed — to what extent did we, as individuals, care for others.
Recently, another dumb cliche started making sense 
to me. In the book “Tuck Everlasting,” Natalie Babbitt says, “Do not fear death, but rather the unlived life. You don’t have to live forever. You just have to live.”
What did she mean by the unlived life?“Apathy” is derived from the Greek term for “with-
out feeling.” In our lack of concern for the suffering of others, we become zombies. 
The world is becoming a colder place, and I’m not 
referring to global warming.
When “good people” like ourselves stay silent, evil 
triumphs. 
The victims of our apathy patiently wait for us. The 
question remains: How long do we keep them waiting?

Former Rep. Jim Wright (D-
Tex.) once held one of the most prominent political positions 
in the United States. From 1987 to 1989, Wright served as speaker of the House of Representatives. However, last Nov. 2, Wright found he might not even be able to cast a ballot in his state’s elections.
The 90-year-old Wright was de-
nied a voter ID card by the Texas Department of Public Safety because his driver’s license had expired in 2010. Wright needed a valid form of identiﬁ  cation to obtain a voter ID card because of a new law enacted by the Texas Legislature.
Similar measures have been enacted in nu-
merous states in the last several years, including North Carolina and Alabama.
Former Rep. Wright is not the only one who 
has been affected by these harsh new voter ID laws. Although Wright encountered difﬁ  culties with the Texas voter registration system because of his age, the groups most likely to be affected by these laws are women and minority groups, particularly African-Americans and Hispanics.
According to Ari Berman of The Nation, His-
panic voters in Texas are 46 to 120 percent more likely than white voters to lack the forms of ID needed to cast a ballot in the state.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has argued that 
“common sense measures such as voter identiﬁ  -cation laws” are needed to combat the threat of voter fraud.
Contrary to the claims of these proponents of 
voter ID laws and similar measures, there is ab-solutely no evidence to suggest voter fraud exists in the United States to any signiﬁ  cant degree.
There are currently more than 11 million reg-
istered voters in Florida. Igor Volsky of Think Progress found that according to the Florida De-partment of Law Enforcement, just “178 cases of alleged voter fraud have been referred to the de-partment since 2000.”
It is clear the voter ID legislation proposed by 
Republicans around the country is a solution in search of a problem. What, then, is the true mo-tivation for enacting such harsh and restrictive legislation?
In the 2008 and 2012 elections, members of 
ethnic and racial minorities voted overwhelm-ingly for President Barack Obama and other Democratic candidates. African-Americans supported Obama over Mitt Romney by a margin of 93 percent to 6 percent. Hispanics also voted for Obama by a wide margin, 71 percent to 27 percent.
The overwhelming support for 
the Democratic Party among these demographic groups, combined with the rapid population growth 
of those groups relative to whites, poses an exis-tential threat to the Republican Party.
Rather than reaching out to members of these 
demographic groups and trying to gain their political support, Republicans have instead cho-sen to make it as difﬁ  cult as possible for them to vote.
The political beneﬁ  t of voter ID laws to the 
GOP has been acknowledged by numerous Re-publican politicians. In 2012, Pennsylvania House leader Mike Turzai said the voter ID law enacted in his state would “allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.”
Some supporters of the voter ID laws and 
similarly restrictive voting measures have been even more blunt about the true purpose of the legislation.
According to Think Progress, Don Yelton, a 
former precinct chair of the Buncombe County, North Carolina Republican Party, said if restric-tive voting measures hurt “a bunch of lazy blacks that wants the government to give them every-thing, so be it.”
Although Yelton resigned after making his 
blatantly racist remarks, he was only saying out loud what Republicans around the country know: If African-Americans, Hispanics and oth-er minorities vote in large numbers, Republicans will lose election after election.
If the Republican Party wants to remain rel-
evant in American politics, it should focus on adapting its policies to suit the interests and be-liefs of a larger number of voters, particularly fast-growing demographics like Hispanics and African-Americans.
Attempting to rig the electoral system by 
making voting more difﬁ  cult for millions of Americans is an attack on democracy itself and should not be tolerated.

opinions@alligator.orgMonday marked Vet-
erans Day, a holiday many Americans 
easily forgot. No grand ﬁ  re-works shows or barbecues happen, and most Americans don’t get the day off from work. The only thing you might notice about Veterans Day is the absence of mail.
Who can blame us?It’s likely at some point in our lives 
we’ve known someone — typically a friend or family member — who served in the Armed Forces, but for a large swath of the American population, Veterans Day is simply just another day.
Caring and respecting our veterans 
should be a top priority, regardless of whether a friend or relative served our country. As thousands of men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan come home, we are letting them down.
Following the Vietnam War, the Amer-
ican public treated veterans poorly as they returned home. Many Vietnam veterans became homeless, cast out by the citizens of the country they served.
More than 62,500 veterans are home-
less on any given night, and it’s about time we stand up and do something for them.
Whether you agree with the reasoning 
for invading Iraq and Afghanistan, no one deserves our respect more than the people who served, fought, died or were serious-ly wounded as a result of the wars.
Many Americans — including some 
great charities — are doing their best to acclimate veterans back to civilian life, including assistance with education, job training and other basic needs. However, far too many of us remain silent on the is-sue and, even worse, others make a mock-ery of the brave men and women of the Armed Forces.
In a “tribute” to the troops, the North-
western University football team wore special jerseys last weekend as part of the Wounded Warrior Project. Although there is nothing inherently wrong with Wound-ed Warrior and the great work they do, there was something very wrong with Northwestern’s uniforms: They were more or less American ﬂ  ags covered in fake blood.
You read that correctly. In 
a tribute to the wounded vet-erans, a football team wore uniforms that looked like an American ﬂ  ag covered in the 
blood of a soldier.
Northwestern might be the most egre-
gious offender, but they are certainly not alone. Since 2008, Major League Baseball has adorned its players in caps featur-ing camouﬂ  age or the American ﬂ  ag  to support the troops. Some NFL teams also joined the fun, with players wearing cam-ouﬂ  age uniforms.
Wearing camouﬂ  age or spraying fake 
blood on your uniform doesn’t mean you support the troops and might be the most superﬁ  cial way to “support the troops,” even if some proceeds of merchandise sales beneﬁ  t organizations like Wounded Warriors.
We must do more than buy hats or 
watch our favorite team wear camo cos-tumes to honor our veterans and the fall-en. I know it’s easy to say and harder to do, but if we’re all ﬂ  ag-loving Americans, it’s due time to stand up and do some-thing more than beat our chests with pa-triotic pride.
Donate a few bucks directly toward a 
group like Wounded Warriors, Welcome Back Veterans or even your local home-less shelter. Take a day off from work or school and volunteer at a shelter or help one of the country’s true heroes with the day-to-day struggles of returning to nor-mal life.
There is so much we can do as a nation 
to help those who serve, and it’s the right thing to do — always. 
These are men and women who sacri-
ﬁ  ced everything for us. Shouldn’t we do the same for them?

UF was ranked No. 15 for send-
ing students abroad, but staff says 
there is still room for improvement.
The 2013 Open Doors Report on 
International Educational Exchange, released Monday, ranked New York University No. 1, with 4,378 stu-dents who studied abroad during the 2011-12 academic year.
UF sent 1,991 students.Dena Roberts, UF Study Abroad 
Services assistant director, said a national ranking is exciting, but the percentage of students studying abroad is still low.
According to the report, only 10 
percent of American undergradu-ates study abroad.
Roberts said about 2 percent of 
UF students study abroad, but she hopes this number will continue to grow.
“It’s the next step to figuring out 
who you are,” she said. “It’s also stepping out of your comfort zone.”
Maxine Dubois, a 22-year-old UF 
criminology and law senior, is one of thousands of UF students who has studied abroad.
Studying in Beijing last summer, 
she didn’t let a little culture shock or a foreign lifestyle-induced up-set stomach stop her from having a good time.
Before leaving, she said she re-
searched Chinese culture, so she wasn’t surprised when strangers snapped photos of her on their phones or touched her dirty blond hair.
The amount of students from 
other countries coming to study in the U.S also increased by 7 percent, according to Open Doors. In the 2012-13 leading institutions for host-ing international students top 25 ranking, UF was No. 17.
Lyn Straka, director of UF ex-change visitor services, said past international students have said they liked the openness of the UF community, especially the open re-lationships between students and professors.
Exchange students’ experiences 
are not limited to just coursework at UF, she said. Their home universi-ties might not have the dormitories or on-campus activities UF students take for granted.
“They don’t just get a new aca-
demic experience,” she said, “but a new cultural one as well.”

Just before the 10th annual Gators March for Babies 
5K fundraiser, Florida received a D grade on the 2013 
March of Dimes Premature Birth Report Card released this month.
Kyle Croft, March of Dimes community director 
for Alachua County, said although the grade was not a change from last year, the preterm birth rate in Florida has increased from 13 percent in 2011 to 13.7 percent in 2012. Croft said this increase is a temporary setback in efforts to reach a 9.6 percent preterm birth rate by 2020.
“I think there’s a misconception that babies are born 
prematurely and all that means is they spend a couple of extra days in the hospital, run a few tests and go home,” Croft said. “This report card really shows that premature birth truly is still a problem.”
Claudia Weeks, director of staff for Gators March for 
Babies, said the low report grade indicates the impor-tance of this year’s walk, which will take place Nov. 24.
“The fact that we are still at a D rating shows that 
there’s so much work that we can do, so much research that needs to be done and so much money that needs to be raised for that,” said Weeks, a 19-year-old UF sus-tainability studies sophomore.
Croft said Gators March for Babies, the UF organiza-
tion for March of Dimes, has set a record-high fundrais-ing goal of $100,000 for this year’s walk in honor of its 10-year anniversary.
Students, faculty and staff can register to participate 
or make a donation anytime before or on the day of the walk. The walk will be on UF’s campus, starting on Tur-lington Plaza at 2 p.m.
About $70,000 has been raised for this year’s walk so 
far, Croft said. Last year, Gators March for Babies raised $62,000. The record for fundraising during the past 10 years is about $80,000 in 2011.
“The goal is in sight,” Croft said. “We could realisti-
cally reach that goal, but we definitely need all the help we can get.”Gators March for

The Institute of Black Culture direc-
tor plans to bring a little charm to UF’s 
campus through her $10,000 program, Project Creating Leaders and Shaping Sisters (CLASS).
Veleashia Smith, the IBC director 
and founder of Project CLASS, said the  12-week enhancement program begins in Spring and is designed to help col-lege women enhance their professional and personal lives. Through various activities, it will focus on academics, etiquette, effective communication, budgeting and relationships.
The participant who shows the most 
improvement will be awarded a $1,000 scholarship.
“I’m not looking at someone at the 
bottom of the barrel to make some drastic change,” she said. “The change starts happening from wherever you are.”
Ashley Jolicoeur, a 19-year-old UF 
nursing sophomore, said she looks for-ward to applying because there’s no course that teaches students how to be classy.
The program will meet every Mon-
day from 5 to 7 p.m. Interviews for Proj-ect CLASS will begin before Thanks-giving Break and applications for the project will be distributed through the Institute of Black Culture.

The judge accepted the accountant as a 
hostile witness. The prosecutors huddled at 
their table, whispering curses, and the 21-year-old UF student knew it was over. Team Targaryen had won.
Charlene Ochogo, a UF telecommunica-tion senior, and her team were one of four Liti-Gators teams that competed in the Mid-dle Tennessee State University’s annual Mid-South Invitational Mock Trial Tournament — one of the country’s largest undergraduate mock trial competitions.
While facing Wheaton College, Ochogo’s 
team decided to go with a risky move and create a “hostile witness” — someone who is used as a scapegoat for the defendant to es-tablish reasonable doubt among the jurors.  
“It’s pretty much the most exciting thing 
you can do in a mock trial,” she said.Team Targaryen took home first place, 
and Team Lannister was fifth in its division. Gators won other awards as well.
To prepare for competitions, Laura 
Sjoberg, a UF associate professor of political science, coaches the mock trial competitive teams two evenings per week. Practices are evenly divided up among constructing cases, cross examination and closing arguments. Then, they do scrimmages with different skill drills, Sjoberg said.
“[Students] really gain analytical skills 
and confidence,” Sjoberg said. “And those things are not only applicable to the major-ity of them who want to go to law school but also to those who want to be actors and sci-entists.”
Two of the four UF trial teams will travel 
to North Carolina for the next competition at Duke University, which begins Saturday.

A grant may soon make setting 
up solar panels for residents and 
small businesses easier and more af-fordable.
The grant from the U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy provides $1.6 mil-lion to help improve the permitting process, promote ﬁ  nancing options, generate publicity for clean energy and jobs, and create a standard for connecting solar systems to the power grid, according to a news re-lease.
Alachua County was included as 
a recipient as part of the six-county Go SOLAR Florida team. The team also includes Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Orange and St. Lucie counties.
Holly Banner, a planner for the 
Alachua County Growth Manage-ment Department, will oversee the county’s participation in the initia-tive. She said it will mostly simplify the permitting and installation pro-cess locally.
“Data shows that 64 percent of the cost of solar installations is re-lated to the soft costs, not related to the cost of the panels themselves,” she said.
Banner said reducing these soft 
costs will make the total ownership and installation price tag of solar panels more predictable.
She said working with other 
counties that have already devel-oped online permitting systems and marketing plans, like Broward County, will beneﬁ  t Alachua Coun-ty. Banner also said developing a guide to ﬁ  nancing options would be part of the county’s participation.
Barry Jacobson, president of 
Gainesville-based Solar Impact Inc., said he thinks these improvements will be helpful, but the solar business is already doing well on its own.
“I don’t see it being a huge game changer,” he said, “because current-ly the ﬁ  nancials for solar make a lot of sense as it is.”
Antony Cato, a 19-year-old Santa 
Fe College political science sopho-more, said programs like this that move the county forward in creat-ing renewable sources of energy are a great use of taxpayer dollars.
“So often we see wasteful spend-
ing or spending that is very con-troversial,” he said. “In this case, whether you’re an environmental-ist or a ﬁ  scally-conservative person, there is a beneﬁ  t.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
STARKE — A man con-
victed in the 1991 sexual assault 
and murder of an aspiring artist in Orlando was executed Tues-day by injection.
Darius Kimbrough was 
pronounced dead at 6:18 p.m. at the Florida State Prison in Starke, ofﬁ  cials said. He did not make any statement, telling of-ﬁ  cials, “No, sir,” when asked if he had any last words.
Kimbrough was condemned 
to die for the October 1991 kill-ing of 28-year-old Denise Col-lins, who was attacked in her apartment as she slept.
Collins’ mother and sis-
ter were among 24 witnesses, including news media, who attended the execution. Her mother, Diane Stewart, said the last 22 years have been “horren-dous” while the family waited for appeals to play out.
“This is well deserved,” 
Stewart told reporters. “Let’s see if we can pick ourselves up a little more and get on with our life.”
The sister, Annette Collins, 
said the execution was a numb-ing experience but also a relief.
“I’m just happy that Denise 
received justice. Wherever she is, I hope she is smiling down,” she said.
It was the second time a new 
mix of drugs was used in Flori-da since a previous execution in October. Earlier Tuesday, Kim-brough ate his last meal, includ-ing pizza, fried chicken, fried green tomatoes and chocolate chip ice cream.Inmate executed for

Florida made it a close 
game against Wisconsin, but 
one shot late in the contest ended the Gators’ hopes Tues-day night. 
Badgers guard Traevon 
Jackson made a jumper from the right elbow to put his team ahead by five points with eight seconds remaining in the game as No. 11 Florida fell to No. 20 Wisconsin 59-53 in the Kohl Center in Madison, Wis.
“We gave ourselves a 
chance,” Florida coach Billy Donovan said. “[Jackson] made a tough shot.”
With Florida (1-1) down 
56-53 with 41.8 seconds left, UW guard Ben Brust missed a three-pointer. Center Patric Young battled for the rebound with Badgers guard Josh Gas-ser, came down with the ball and drew a foul.
Young went 1 of 2 from the 
line. 
But during the next posses-
sion, Florida chose to not foul and allowed Wisconsin (2-0) to run down the clock. 
After Jackson’s shot, guard 
Michael Frazier II raced down the other end to find Jacob Kurtz on the wing. Kurtz drove down the lane past two defend-ers but saw his shot blocked by Frank Kaminsky, and the Bad-gers got the rebound.
Brust made his first free 
throw with 2.4 seconds left to effectively end the game. 
“We have too many break-
downs in crucial situations,” 
Erika Tymrak scored her 
first goal for the U.S. Women’s National Team last weekend. Read the 
story on page 14. Swimmers honored
Sebastien Rousseau, Kahlia Warner and Danielle Valley were honored by the Southeastern Conference in its weekly awards, the league announced Tuesday.AP Photo

Wisconsin hands Florida first loss 
� JUNIOR HAS RECORDED 23 CAREER SACKS.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Florida’s offensive line will face arguably its toughest chal-
lenge on Saturday in Columbia, S.C. 
Lining up on the opposing defensive line will be All-American 
defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, a projected top-three pick in 
May’s NFL Draft.
“I don’t know if you stop Clowney,” offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease said. 
Instead, Pease and the offensive line will do their best to slow 
him down — a tough task, as evidenced by the junior’s 23 career sacks and 42 career tackles for a loss.
“He’s a great player, not just good,” fullback Hunter Joyer said. “He’s quick, has counter moves. He has 
everything a defensive end needs: strength, size. He’s a complete player and that’s why he’s projected to go so high in the draft and ev-erything.”
Clowney has had success against Florida in 
the past. 
As a freshman in 2011, he had only one tack-
le — which resulted in a 1-yard loss — while also forcing a fumble in South Carolina’s 17-12 
victory in Columbia.
Last season, the tables were turned, as the Gators dominated 
the Gamecocks in a 44-11 win. 
However, Clowney had a more productive game, notching 
five tackles — including two for a loss — and an 8-yard sack.Clowney presents steep challenge for GatorsBrent Pease expected his second season 
as Florida’s offensive coordinator to be 
smoother than his first. 
He had another year to implement his 
system, a confident starting quarterback and several new toys in his arsenal that 
were expected to help the 
Gators develop a more dynamic offense. 
But those thoughts 
have since been replaced by concerns regarding his job security amid contin-ued struggles from Flori-da’s offense and growing bitterness from fans. 
“It’s human nature to probably think 
about that,” Pease said. “But I still got an obligation to this team, and the head coach, and the players I coach and the ad-ministration that I work for.”
A year after enjoying an 11-2 season 
and a trip to the Sugar Bowl, the Gators (4-5, 3-4 Southeastern Conference) have lost four straight games and have fallen out of contention in the SEC Eastern Division. 
Florida has not had a losing record this 
late in a season since going 0-10-1 in 1979, which is the last time the Gators finished with a losing record. That mark could fall this season, as UF will be a heavy under-dog in two of its three remaining games and is at risk of missing a bowl game for the first time since 1990. 
“You never want to have a losing record 
or not be able to make it to a bowl game, so we’re just trying to win for our pride and for ourselves,” Hunter Joyer said.
A lack of production from a stagnant 
offense has been a key contributor to Flor-ida’s decline. 
The Gators are tied for 106th nationally 
in scoring offense and rank even lower in total offense. 
After scoring just one total offensive 
touchdown during losses to LSU and Mis-souri, Florida was held without a touch-down in the first half of its 23-20 loss to Georgia. A week later, Vanderbilt clob-bered Florida at home to earn its first win in Gainesville since 1945. 
Each loss — and every poor offensive 
showing — increases the pressure on Pease, who is under contract through the 2015 season. Pease accepts 
criticism of struggling UF offensive unit

ORLANDO — Erika Tymrak 
put her hands on her head and 
smiled in disbelief.
In her second appearance with 
the U.S. Women’s National Team, the former Gators midfielder scored her first goal in a 4-1 victory against Brazil in an international friendly match at the Citrus Bowl in Orlan-do on Sunday night.
USWNT rookie Lindsey Horan 
fed the ball through to Tymrak at the left corner of the penalty arc.
Tymrak nudged it to the right 
and rifled a low, right-footed shot between two Brazil defenders clos-ing in on her. The ball sank into the left corner, just out of Brazil goal-keeper Thais’ reach.
“I’m so overwhelmed, but in a 
good way," Tymrak said. "It was an incredible feeling that I could get my first goal in my home state.”
USWNT forward and former 
Florida soccer great Abby Wam-bach shared in the excitement.
“I was jumping up on the side-lines like a little kid,” Wambach said. “Obviously, she’s a former Gator, and I’m really proud of her for getting her first goal.”
USWNT coach Tom Sermanni 
was proud to see Tymrak notch her first career goal.
“It’s a dream come true,” Ser-
manni said. “Scoring the goal, I don’t think she knew quite what to do at first ... I’ll take the credit for the substitution. 
“Those are the kinds of things 
players dream about doing, and to come in the game for just two min-utes and score, is just fantastic."
Getting the national team call up 
was something Tymrak worked to-ward for more than a year.
She ended her collegiate career 
as the 2012 Southeastern Confer-ence Offensive Player of the Year, scoring nine goals and tallying 12 assists.
She is tied for third in program 
history, notching 40 assists in four years. She finished her career eighth in Florida history in goals with 32.
After college, Tymrak had no 
trouble adjusting to professional soccer. FC Kansas City drafted her in the second round of the National Women’s Soccer League draft, and she got off to a quick start.
Tymrak started in 16 matches, 
scored six goals and notched four assists in just two months of play to earn the NWSL Rookie of the Year honor.
Less than a month later, the 
22-year-old received her first cap on the U.S. senior team in an interna-tional friendly match against Mexi-co in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 3.
Sermanni started Tymrak in the 
midfield for that match, but she ended the game without an offen-sive statistic.
To further prove herself ready 
for the international team, Tymrak trained in Germany with the FC Bayern Munich Women club team and scored twice in a German Cup match against TSV Crailsheim on Sept. 30.
“I think for a player like Erika, 
going and getting the experience of playing a different environment, a different style of soccer and a different culture, it’s a balance,” Sermanni said. “Being away from home, out of your comfort zone, all those things, I think, are good for players.” 
It paid off.Tymrak's play abroad caught 
the attention of Sermanni again, and he added her to the U.S. roster against Brazil.
Tymrak said she appreciated 
the support Wambach gave her through training.
“[Wambach] helps me on and 
off the field,” Tymrak said. “I feel really thankful and blessed to have a former Gator on the team looking out for me. I’m really lucky.”
Tymrak will return to FC Bay-
ern Munich to finish out training through Dec. 31.
With her professional soccer 
career taking off, the 22-year-old midfielder remains humble and re-members her beginning at UF.
“Florida taught me a lot,” Tym-
rak said. “I owe a lot of it to my coaches over there and their sup-port. 
“It’s just amazing that I could 
transition the way I have and play in front of everyone in my home state.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 2013

After a late-season bye week, the No. 5 
Gators will try to shake off any rust and 
bring home a Southeastern Conference title. 
“It feels good to be back because we 
haven’t played anyone but ourselves in a while,” junior libero Taylor Unroe said.  “So, it’s always good to see some fresh faces on the other side of the net.”During the bye 
week, UF worked on weaknesses that the coaching staff 
noticed in a five-set win against Texas A&M on Nov. 3.  
Florida (22-2, 11-1 SEC) will play four 
of its last six games at home to finish the season, starting with a struggling South Carolina squad tonight at 6 p.m.  
The Gamecocks opened the season with 
three straight sweeps but have won just three of their last 10 matches. Each loss came in three sets.  
The danger for Florida will be not over-looking a team that could ruin its shot at the SEC title before No. 7 Missouri comes to Gainesville on Friday.  
Florida has a chance to avenge its four-
set loss at Missouri on Oct. 20 and reclaim the top spot in the conference. 
“Any team in the SEC on any given 
day can win, especially against us because they’re going to play their best,” Unroe said.  
“It’s pretty easy not to overlook them 
because we know we’re going to get their best shot, and something crazy could hap-pen.”
Senior middle blocker Chloe Mann will likely give the Gamecocks’ inexperienced defense fits. 
Mann has added to her impressive ca-
reer with a senior season for the record books.  
She currently leads the NCAA in hit-
ting percentage at .514. The next highest is Missouri’s Whitney Little, who is hitting .493.   
“Chloe’s a freak,” Unroe said.  “It’s al-
ways good to have her on our side of the net.  I would never want to play against her.  
"It’s awesome playing with her every 
day.  She’s a crazy person.”

With Week 10 of the NFL season in the books, here are a few 
former Gators who made the most tangible impact for their respec-
tive teams.
Riley Cooper, wide receiver: Riley Cooper keeps mak-
ing big plays for the Philadelphia Eagles.
During his team’s 27-13 road win against the Green Bay 
Packers on Sunday, Cooper caught three passes for a team-high 102 yards and two touchdowns.
His second catch, a 45-yard touchdown reception from 
quarterback Nick Foles, put the Eagles ahead 17-3 with 11:21 remaining in the third. Foles faked a handoff to Bryce Brown, dropped back and then found Cooper. The fourth-year receiver beat two defensive backs to roll into the end zone. Later in the quarter, Cooper caught a 32-yard touchdown 
pass to increase Philadelphia's lead to 27-10. On the play, Foles dropped back and found a wide-open Cooper, who ran down the left sideline untouched into the end zone. 
Cooper has totaled at least 88 receiving 
yards in four of his past fives games and has seven receptions of at least 25 yards. Through 10 games, he is 31st in the league in receiving yards with 555 on 28 catches and has seven touchdowns.
Carlos Dunlap, defensive end: During 
the Cincinnati Bengals' 20-17 overtime loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Carlos Dun-lap filled up the box score.
The starting left defensive end forced a fumble for his 
second straight game and recorded two of his team’s five sacks on Ravens signal-caller Joe Flacco for a loss of 17 yards. Dunlap also had five tackles. He has six sacks this season, tied for 19th in the NFL. 
Jordan Reed, tight end: Although the Washington Red-
skins fell to the Minnesota Vikings 34-27 on Thursday night, rookie Jordan Reed had another large impact.  
Reed caught six balls for 62 yards and a touchdown in 
the loss. His 11-yard touchdown reception put the Redskins ahead of the Vikings 17-14 with 5:02 remaining in the sec-ond quarter. 
Notes: Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin 
(hip) did not play Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons but was activated Monday. He could play against his former team, the Vikings, this Sunday.

Donovan said. “We don’t get the rebound after a missed shot. We 
fall asleep on a three-point shooter. We have a careless turnover. We fall asleep on a back cut. We foul with two seconds to go on the shot clock. 
“Just little things like that that’s got nothing to do with tal-
ent. It’s got much, much more to do with experience and being in those situations a little bit more.”
Florida struggled to defend the three-point line Tuesday. Af-
ter starting 0 of 4 from behind the arc, Wisconsin hit 9 of its final 16 three-point attempts. 
Frazier led the way for the Gators with 20 points on 7-of-11 
shooting, including a 5-of-7 clip from behind the arc. Excluding Frazier, Florida was 0 of 7 from three-point range.
After a 28-point showing Friday against North Florida, for-
ward Casey Prather added 12 points. Freshman point guard Kasey Hill, who fouled out with 3:25 remaining, went 2-of-11 shooting for four points, recorded four assists and grabbed three rebounds. 
Donovan stressed after Florida’s 77-69 win against UNF that 
his team needed to improve defensively and change its overall attitude. Those adjustments were present early. 
Behind a trio of three-pointers on consecutive possessions by 
Frazier, Florida jumped out to a 16-4 lead about seven minutes into the game. 
But the Badgers responded with a 13-0 run during a span of 
7:15 late in the first half to enter halftime with a 29-26 lead.
The Gators trailed by as many as 11 points in the second half 
after a 14-4 Badgers run, but they used a 15-9 run during a span of 10 minutes to cut the deficit to three.
Florida shot 40.4 percent from the field, but missed 7 of its 17 
free throws. Wisconsin shot 43.8 percent and outrebounded UF 31-28. 
Despite the loss, Donovan saw his group — which was with-
out Scottie Wilbekin, Dorian Finney-Smith and Damontre Harris due to suspension — make progress Tuesday night. 
“This is really, really good for our team,” Donovan said. “Just 
to see what we’ve got to do, where we need to continue to get better.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.Florida’s second-year of-
fensive coordinator agrees 
the offense has underper-formed this season and said he understands the anger many fans feel toward him. 
“It’s the same thing we 
tell the kids, you’ve got to be mentally tough,” Pease said. “You’ve got to shut it out sometimes. And I under-stand what people are saying and frustrated with. 
“I mean, do they under-
stand all of the circumstanc-es? Not all of the time. But you’ve got to work through it. In my situation, I don’t think you can lose confidence in who you are and what you believe in and how you got to doing your job.”
Pease and the Gators have 
had to deal with more than the usual number of distrac-tions this season. 
Florida’s offense has lost 
its starting quarterback, run-ning back, two offensive line-men and a wide receiver for the season due to injury. Sev-eral other players have also missed extended periods of time because of injury or sus-pension. 
Tyler Murphy, who re-
placed Jeff Driskel earlier this season, is currently dealing with a sprained shoulder that has kept him out of practice this week and is questionable to play Saturday against No. 10 South Carolina.  
“It’s tough, and I mean 
what are you going to do?” Pease said of the injuries to offensive players. 
“You got to play the cards 
you’re dealt.”

Tyler Murphy (3) drops back during the Gators’ 34-17 loss to the Commodores.
Racial slurs upset Harrison
“We’re going to have to do a lot of things 
with him in the pass [protection] game, 
whether it’s double teaming him or stuff like that,” guard Jon Halapio said.
Clowney has not lived up to the Heis-
man Trophy hype that surrounded him before the season began — the junior has not recorded a sack since Sept. 14 — but he could look to get on track against a banged-up Gators offensive line.
Florida has had trouble protecting its 
quarterback in recent weeks. Defenses have sacked redshirt junior quarterback Tyler Murphy 19 times in UF’s last four games.
The Gators are missing three start-
ers from their offensive line. Tackle Chaz Green (labrum) has missed the whole sea-son, tackle Tyler Moore (elbow) is out for the rest of the year after a scooter accident and tackle D.J. Humphries (knee) is doubt-ful for Saturday’s game.
“We’re just going to have to make do 
with what we have,” Halapio said. “I think we’ve got seven left. We’re really going to have to grind it out this week and just go from there.”
Center explains ejection: During the 
third quarter of Florida’s game against Ar-kansas on Oct. 5, center Jon Harrison was ejected after apparently making contact with a referee. 
After the game, coach Will Muschamp 
did not comment on whether Harrison touched the official, saying Harrison “lost his temper and did something he shouldn’t have done.”
Harrison had a chance to tell his side of 
the story on Tuesday.
The redshirt senior said he was trying to 
explain that an Arkansas player was direct-ing racial slurs at him, and Harrison wanted the referee to control the situation. 
“I got called every version of the ‘n-
word’ known to man,” Harrison said. “And I went up to the ref and I’m like, ‘Ref, please, you have to control this player. He’s been calling me every racial slur.’”
Harrison said while gesturing, he acci-
dentally touched the referee. He said he did not know he was penalized until he saw the flag, heard his number called and was es-corted off the field.
“There was no malicious intent. I wasn’t 
trying to be an a-hole or anything,” Harri-son said. 
“I was honestly was just trying to tell the 
ref to get this player because I was getting attacked, I felt like I was getting harassed, and it was beyond football. 
“Calling me the n-word and everything 
is not football anymore. It is just going out of your way.”noteS , from page 13hoopS , from page 13Sophomore guard led 
Gators with 20 pointsEvery now and then, Grantland.com attempts to write the 
worst sports column on Earth. Today, Joe will try, too.
With the 4-5 Gators fading fast, most folks reckon 
Florida should just reach for the sky.
But I’m not most folks.With bowl eligibility and good, old-fashioned pride on 
the line, I suggest that UF should instead reach for the Sky-ler.
That’s right. I’m talking about Skyler Mornhinweg.Put him in, coach. He’s ready to play. Today.“But, Joe,” the masses cry. “He’s just a redshirt fresh-
man.”
Oh, yeah? Somebody tell Jameis Winston he’s a redshirt 
freshman.
He can’t hear the haters. He can’t even see the haters.Now you know why he’s squinting all the time.I bet Skyler’s a squinter. He also wears headphones on 
the sideline every Saturday.
“Troll, troll, troll,” the haters say. “Blah, blah, blah.”They try their best, but they can’t get to Skyler.“What are the haters saying?” I’d ask Skyler.He’d reply, “Beats (by Dre) me.”But I’m through with the puns and games. Hear is my 
point. Just listen.
UF should start Mornhinweg on Saturday.Tyler Murphy is not the savior Gators fans hoped he’d 
be, and he’s dealing with an injured throwing shoulder. I don’t see Jeff Driskel walking through that door either.
Driskel doesn’t even know my home address. Even if he 
did, he’d have to knock ﬁ  rst.
Skyler’s been knocking for weeks, but Muschamp hasn’t 
heard him. Now he’s ringing the doorbell. Ding. Dong.
Muschamp and Brent Pease need answers, so they need 
to answer. I, too, searched for answers following Florida’s historic loss to Vanderbilt on Saturday.
With a furrowed brow, I sat at the kitchen table the next 
morning, ﬁ  lling out the Sunday Crossword Puzzle.
“Ten-letter word for ‘Winner,’” the puzzle read.At ﬁ  rst glance, the answer seemed simple: T-I-M-M-Y T-E-B-O-W
Unfortunately, life is not that 
simple. Legends are for all time, not every time.
Then, it clicked. M-O-R-N-H-I-N-W-E-G.For the Gator Nation’s sake, 
let’s hope Muschamp does the Sunday Crossword Puzzle.
Let’s hope he’s good at it. Most 
of all, let’s hope he can spell.
Muschamp’s ability to spell could save Florida from its 
offensive dry spell.
Just ﬁ  ll in the blank, and next week’s 10-letter word for 
winner will be: B-R-E-N-T P-E-A-S-E or M-R M-U-S-C-H-A-M-P!
If you don’t, next week’s 13-letter word for “Loser” will 
read: N-O-T M-O-R-N-H-I-N-W-E-G instead of S-T-E-V-E S-P-U-R-R-I-E-R or S-O-U-T-H C-A-R-O-L-I-N-A.
Puzzles are difﬁ  cult, Will. Don’t be too hard on yourself. 
It takes time. Same goes for the fans.
M-O-R-N-H-I-N-W-E-G.Get used to writing it. Get used to tweeting it. Add it to 
your Spell Check dictionary.
He’s a redshirt freshman. Not a red-squiggly-line-under-
his-last-name freshman.
Get used to saying it, too. When talking about the next 
great UF quarterback, pronounce his name correctly: morn-HEN-wig.
There’s only room for one Verne Lundquist in the South-
eastern Conference. Don’t you dare steal Uncle Verne’s carefully crafted shtick of botching every player’s name.
Verne will always have the last chortle, but I digress.If the Gators go with Mornhinweg in Columbia, S.C., 
they’ll be the ones chortling on Saturday night.
And when Muschamp ﬁ  lls out the Sunday Cross-
word Puzzle this weekend fresh off a second straight vic-tory against Spurrier, another 10-letter word will be on his mind.
