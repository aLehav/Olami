� THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN 
WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville gay rights supporters are 
excited that a California same-sex mar -
riage ban was deemed unconstitutional 
Tuesday by a San Francisco federal ap-peals panel.
The ban, called Proposition 8, was ap-
proved by 52 percent of California voters in 2008. Supporters expect the issue to go to the Supreme Court, although the appeal had not been sent as of Tuesday night. Until then, Gainesville groups will wait and celebrate.
Terry Fleming, co-president of the 
Pride Community Center of North Cen-tral Florida, said members of the center are thrilled with the decision and will watch to see what happens next.
“This is a historic decision that will 
have an impact across the nation,” he said. “If it violates it in California, it vio-lates it across the nation.”
Bridget Siegel, external vice president 
for the Pride Student Union at UF, said the announcement was a big victory for gay rights supporters. The group has not planned activist activities in reaction to the announcement, but she said she ex-pects the group to arrange events within the next week.
“Finally for it to be deemed complete-
ly unconstitutional is an amazing oppor -
tunity ,” said Siegel, a 20-year-old religion studies sophomore.
Mayor Craig Lowe, who is the city’s 
first openly gay mayor, said the measure was a step forward for the nation.
If the Supreme Court decides to look at 
the issue, Lowe said he will consider ask-ing the City Commission to pass a reso-lution supporting the push for same-sex marriage.
“Ultimately, what will be required is 
the realization that all families have value and deserve to be respected under the law,” Lowe said.Gay rights

A UF fraternity is under investigation for 
a reported hazing incident.  
Alpha Phi Alpha, a National Pan-Hellen-
ic Council fraternity, has been implicated in a 
hazing incident that occurred over the week-end, said interim vice president for Student Affairs Dave Kratzer.
The incident was reported on Saturday , according to the University Police Department’s Crime Log. However, the hazing began Jan. 9, the first day of the spring semester.
UF President Bernie 
Machen emailed a state-
ment to students Tuesday afternoon to announce that UPD is investigating 
the incident. The Division of Student Affairs is assisting in the investigation, he said.
Machen did not name the fraternity, but 
Kratzer confirmed it was Alpha Phi Alpha.
“With the nature of this investigation, 
there is simply not a lot that we can discuss at this time,” said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
Kratzer said no one was hospitalized as 
a result of the hazing, which occurred off UF fraternity under investigation for hazing

Standing at the front door of 
an unknown house in northern 
Gainesville on Feb. 1, Lenard Norman was already anxious about the police.
About four hours earlier, 
around 7 p.m., Norman re-sponded to a Craigslist ad in the personal/casual encounters sec-tion. After exchanging emails, Norman learned he was chatting with a 14-year-old boy, accord-ing to the arrest report.
The boy said his parents were 
out of town. Norman, 24, said he would swing by the house.  
“Still i m a little worried about 
u being underage,” he wrote. “Not looking to go to jail.”When he arrived at the house, 
Norman rang the doorbell. Four officers came outside, grabbed his hands, covered his mouth and pulled him to the ground. The “14-year-old boy” was re-ally Gainesville Police Detective Scott Meffen Jr.
Norman, charged with three 
counts of obscene communica-tion, was one of 21 men arrested as part of Operation Tailfeather, a joint investigation by GPD and the Alachua Country Sherrif’s Office that began Jan. 30 and ended Monday morning.
Norman is a UF alumnus. 
He graduated last year from the College of Education, and was fired Monday from his job teach-ing second graders at Metcalfe

During Tuesday night’s Student Senate 
meeting, UF’s Supervisor of Elections pre-
sented her backup plan for the spring elec-tions but did not bring a list of secondary polling locations.
Toni Megna did not accept questions. She divided her plan for the Feb. 21 and 
Feb. 22 elections into several sections.
If less than half of the 11 polling loca-
tions are down, poll workers will direct students to other locations.
If more than half are down for less than 
an hour, the time will not be made up. 
If that many are down between one and 
six hours, polls will stay open three hours later. 
But if this occurs on the last voting day, 
the time will not be made up.
If more than half are down for more 
than six hours on any day, voting will re-sume on the run-off days, Feb. 28 and Feb. 29.
Megna also said the Election Commis-
sion will approve the list of polling loca-tions on Friday at 5:30 p.m.
According to election codes, Megna was 
also supposed to present a list of backup polling locations. 
But at Tuesday’s meeting, she said that 
would be impossible.
“Only possible way to have [polling lo-
cations] in a moment’s notice or a couple hours are to have unsecured location vot-ing,” she said.
This violates the election codes, she 
said.
After the meeting, Megna said she talk-
ed to the voting program facilitator, Steven Bourdon, on Monday about the locations. 
She said she learned that having sec-
ondary locations would be impossible.
After the meeting, Election Code Revi-
sion Committee co-chair Katie Waldman said she was not aware backup polling lo-cations would be impossible.
“I would like to look [the plan] over and 
see if it follows the revisions,” she said.
Students Party Sen. Gillian Leytham 
said after the meeting that Megna’s plans seemed incoherent.
“Her job is to provide detailed proce-
dures if something were to go wrong,” she said. “And she provided us with non-sense.”

Seven people went to Sen. Steve Oelrich’s 
office on Tuesday to thank him for opposing 
a state bill that would privatize jails across the state.
Oelrich announced his opposition Feb. 
1 for a bill that would privatize prisons in Florida, which supporters said would take jobs out of town and give local jobs to cor -
porations.
The supporters, which included four ac-
tivists and three police union members, said Oelrich’s support showed them that unions have a voice in Florida legislation.
Oelrich is in Tallahassee for the legisla-
tive session. The supporters thanked his staff with a bouquet of orange roses and white and purple flowers wrapped in purple ribbon.
The Corrections Corporation of America 
would manage Florida’s jails if the bill is ap-proved. State Bill 2038, the piece of legisla-tion, was introduced to the Senate on Jan. 20.The company says it can save taxpayers 
between $16 million and $45 million, said Jeff McAdams, president of the Alachua County Fraternal Order of Police lodge, Gator Lodge No. 67.
“I have never heard of something so frightening and absurd,” McAdams said. He has been with the Gainesville Police Depart-ment for 19 years. “There are more efficient ways to use taxpayer money.”
Activist Dave Schneider said unions keep 
jobs in town, and the current governor doesn’t understand that, 
“Prison privatization puts any community 
at risk,” he said. “Once they privatize prison, schools are next.”
Others are more concerned about public 
safety.
“This bill does nothing to protect our citi-
zens,” McAdams said.
Under the bill, if there was ever a pris-
oner breakout, the Corrections Corporation of America would be responsible to pay for the first 48 hours of apprehension. But after that, it would be the taxpayer’s responsibil-ity, he said.
The senator received 2,000 emails in the 
past week supporting his fight against the privatization of jails in Florida, said Tonya Shays, a legislative assistant in Oelrich’s of-fice.
“The elected officials need to remember 
who elects and un-elects them,” McAdams said.4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2012

UF students can find fitness 
classes, track instructors and share 
their opinions through a new fitness website and application.
The web-based service, peerFit, 
aims to increase access to group fitness information. UF graduate students Ed Buckley, Scott Peeples, Matt Redinger and Rex Tullius make up the team behind the free service.
It features campus facilities such 
as Living Well, Southwest Recre-ation Center and Student Recreation and Fitness Center.
Although peerFit has been avail-
able as a prototype since the sum-mer, this week marks its debut at UF. The team will host a launch par -
ty at 101 Cantina Sunday at 6 p.m.
“We tried to build a system that 
made exercising fun and personal-ized,” said Buckley, 24, who found-ed peerFit and is working toward a doctoral degree in health education and behavior.
The service allows users to search 
nearby facilities, learn about group fitness classes, follow instructors and share feedback. It is also avail-able as an iPhone or Android app 
and links to Facebook and Twitter.
Sarah Taj, a 19-year-old criminol-
ogy junior, said she would use peer -
Fit to track her favorite instructors.
“I know some instructors use 
different techniques, and you nev-
er know which other classes they teach, so that could be helpful,” said Taj, who takes group classes at Southwest Recreation Center.
Users can register with the ser -
vice, but registration is not required to search the site. Registered users can receive reminders to sign up for certain classes.
Mike Avery, the program assis-
tant in fitness at Living Well in Yon Hall, said peerFit is a great way to share group fitness information with students.
“Non-members can see what we 
offer,” he said. “It’s a good way for members to see what they are get-ting into.”
The peerFit team tested a proto-
type formed in March 2011 created by a programming team. By the summer, 44 universities had tested it, and 15 of them used the live test version in the fall.
During the first eight months, 
the team paid for the research and design themselves. Since then, they have raised $150,000, Buckley said.
“Our goal is to get people into 
the right group fitness class for them, and that’s what our system does,” he said. “It’s to help find a class that’s right for you.”

A 19-year-old woman 
was killed in a single-car ac-
cident on Interstate 75 Tues-day morning.
Devin Arielle Turnquist, 
whose hometown was Clear -
water, Fla., was driving south on I-75 in a Ford Explorer pickup when she drove off the interstate and into a tree, according to a Florida High-way Patrol report.
After hitting the tree, her 
pickup flipped over and slid down a ditch on the west side of the interstate.
FHP responded to a call 
around 8 a.m., reporting a damaged fence near mile marker 379 in the south-bound lane of I-75.
When troopers arrived 
to the scene, they found the pickup in some brush in the ditch.
Turnquist was pro-
nounced dead on the scene, the report said.
Julie Garrett, a spokes-
woman for Santa Fe College, said Turnquist was listed in the Santa Fe directory but was not currently taking classes.

UF has set a goal of zero waste on campus by 2015, and 
a soft drink company wants to help make that happen.
This year’s Pepsi Refresh Project will sponsor one 
$10,000 grant and one $5,000 grant for student organiza-
tions that develop campaigns to help reach the zero-waste goal.
There are seven finalists in the two categories.Students can vote for the idea they would like to see 
happen at gator1.ufl.edu/zerowaste. V oting closes at noon on Feb. 29.
In 2010, Pepsi Refresh awarded Dance Marathon at UF 
a $15,000 grant and Gators Do It With Helmets On with a $5,000 grant, both for improving the community . The competition did not include a zero-waste stipulation.
This time, UF Business Services, Pepsi representatives 
and the Office of Sustainability decided to link the zero-waste goal with the grant contest.
Last month, a panel of judges from Pepsi, UF Business 
Services and the Office of Sustainability reviewed project submissions for content and feasibility.
The projects must have expected completion dates 
within a year of the date the grants are awarded, accord-ing to the official rules.
The three $10,000 finalists are Gators Going Green, 
Florida Alternative Breaks and Gators for a Sustainable Campus.
Gators Going Green has been using Twitter and Face-book to encourage students to vote, said the organization’s executive director, Brittnie Baker.
“Going zero-waste is one way we can move in a posi-
tive direction for the health of our environment,” she said.
Baker said the grant money could make an impact be-
yond UF’s campus.
Pennington said all the ideas are creative and exciting.“We’d honestly be happy to see any of them win,” she 
said. “Hopefully they get out, rally votes for their ideas and we see some fun stuff come to shape on campus.” Pepsi Refresh Project to sponsor grants

school-supply vending machine, located on the second floor of Library West on Tuesday after -

� THE MACHINE ACCEPTS GATOR 
1 CARDS OR CREDIT CARDS AND WILL BE WORKING BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL

Frantic study sessions in Library 
West might be less stressful with the 
addition of a school-supply vending machine.
The machine, which sells pens, pa-
per, notecards and blue books, was put on the second floor near a copy ma-chine last week.
As of Tuesday, the supplies machine 
was not functional. The credit card reader had not been put in yet, said Mike Chambers, a programming as-sistant for Business Services. He said it will be working by the end of the week.
The machine, funded by the book-
store, takes Gator 1 Cards or credit cards, but not cash, said UF Bookstores director Lynne Vaughan. She said it will be easier to maintain without cash.
Vaughan said Student Government 
asked for supplies to put a machine near the library about a year ago.
“I’m anxious to see how well it 
does,” Vaughan said.
The vending machine is convenient, 
said 19-year-old health science fresh-man Ashley Goez. She said she would use it if she had to go to class and needed a folder, but she wouldn’t use it regularly.
“Here, it’s a little more expensive 
than other places, like Walmart,” she said.
The prices are higher than at the 
bookstore to account for taxes, Vaughan said.
She declined to comment on the cost 
but said the machines are “very expen-sive.” Before the university looks at installing more, she said, the UF Book-store will determine if it’s economically feasible.Library West vending machine offers school supplies

A commercial tire fire started Tuesday afternoon in south-
east Gainesville will burn for the next few days.
According to Alachua County Fire Rescue Lt. James Clif-ford, a group of workers used a rotary saw to cut down a met-
al building in the back of Jolo Enterprises Inc., a scrapyard, at 3530 SE Hawthorne Road at about 2:30 p.m.
Sparks from the saw and large piles of tires caught fire, 
and the building went up in flames.
Clifford said nine fire trucks answered the initial call.The Division of Forestry bulldozed a dirt perimeter around 
the fire, and hours later, it burned and smoldered while Clif-ford and crew, the only fire truck left on scene at 6 p.m., rolled up the last hose. A large pillar of black smoke crept skyward.
“The fire is 100 percent contained,” Clifford said, “but it’s 
going to burn for days.”
He said considering the amount of tire and debris in the 
contained area, letting it burn out on its own was the best op-tion.Commercial fire started in scrapyard to burn out by itself

Proposition 8?
70 TOTAL VOTES43% YES
57% NOTuesday’s question: Are you planning on suggesting platform ideas to Student Government parties? Social media useful in moderation
As college students, we are the members of what 
many call the “Internet generation.” We are the constant inhabitants of the Internet — rarely does 
a trinket of pop-culture knowledge pass by unseen. We spend our days glued to our devices, checking what our friends are doing, celebrities are saying and politicians are regretting. 
Scientists and prognosticators often speak of a time 
in the distant future when the human race will attain “singularity” — that is, an era when technology is so ad-vanced that machines will constantly interface with hu-mans  without interruption. While we do not yet have blood-cell sized repair bots running through our veins and intelligence modifiers in our brains, the first stage of this metamorphosis is already upon us. 
Facebook is the crowning jewel of this age of presin-
gularity. Social-media addiction is a well-documented blight upon the younger generation. Indeed, the little red notification indicator has become akin to a drag on a ciga-rette. We crave responses on our statuses and pictures be-cause we are addicted to gratification. We want to know that in a country of hundreds of millions of people, some are paying attention to us. 
Even the very format of a Facebook page is emblemat-
ic of our generation’s narcissism. Many of our pages are filled with hundreds of photos of ourselves, all waiting to be “liked” by others. When we peer at our own Facebook pages, we are not unlike Narcissus staring at his own re-flection, so entranced by ourselves that we cannot look away.  
As Americans, our primary media consists of either 
corporations trying to sell us products or politicians try-ing to win our votes. Both parties rely on flattery in order to convince us, and thus we are used to being flattered. We are a society built around the cult of the individual, therefore we bear no apprehensions over owning a Face-book page that exists in order to advertise ourselves.What does it say about our 
generation that we are willing to prostitute ourselves in such a manner? What sort of system re-quires friends to visit individual shrines in order to interact with them? Such a paradigm does not compose a healthy pursuit of genuine human interaction. 
How often do we sit at a bus stop or our desks in class and, instead of speaking with the people around us, check our notifications and post new statuses? This sort of behavior is proof that Facebook inherently encourages the limitation of social interaction, not the expansion of it. 
“Social” media is thus a paradoxical term. Media itself 
has become a personal pursuit, not a social one. In the early days of radio and television, families and friends would huddle around such devices, and they would pro-vide a catalyst for conversation. Now we sit peering into a small screen with headphones in our ears, ignoring those around us. Is to be permanently in isolation a healthy sta-tus quo? Furthermore, is it even a human one?
Tools such as Facebook can be put to noble ends if 
used in moderation. However, the website’s addictive qualities are undeniable, and as Internet users, we should never confuse our tools for ends in and of themselves. 
While Facebook can be used to invite people to events 
and connect with lost friends, its uses should stop there. When pursuing true human interaction, the healthy ap-proach exists in the physical realm. 
When the real world becomes a sacrificial lamb at the 
foot of our personal shrines, we flirt with ghosts and for -
get those around us.

Fines, arrests over 
tardiness ludicrous
The likelihood of seeing a solar eclipse or Halley’s Comet 
is greater than the chances of seeing politicians of op-posite political parties agree on something — in public, 
at least. 
However, politicians of all political stripes tend to agree 
on one fundamental principle: We must do everything we can to protect the children. The phrase “for the children” has been a part of every politician’s stump speech at least once, if not more.
Liberals want to make sure all children have access to 
health care, and conservatives want to make sure all children have one mommy and one daddy, but the overall concern is the same. 
But when does the concern for the welfare of children go 
too far? 
In Virginia, Loudoun County Public School officials might 
have gone beyond the level of sanity trying to protect kids. 
For officials in Loudoun County, child tardiness is a se-
rious problem. So much so that the district has begun issu-ing misdemeanors and even arresting parents for not getting their kids to school on time. 
In one of the more serious cases, a Loudoun mother named 
Maureen Blake was “arrested and charged with ‘contribut-ing to the delinquency of her minor children by causing them to be habitually late to school,’” according to the Washington Post. 
Tardiness is now considered delinquency? It might be a 
minor inconvenience, but arresting a mother for not getting her child to school on time is a little extreme. 
Blake is not the only one facing charges.Amy and Mark Denicore were each charged with Class 3 
misdemeanors, which could lead to a maximum fine of $500 per parent. Their crime: the family has “been late almost 30 times since September” and, according to the Post, most “of those tardies were for three minutes or less, according to school records.”
Oh, the humanity! The actions of this school district are nanny statism run 
amok, and they could have more serious consequences for children than these rules attempt to solve. 
According to Judith Browne Dianis, the co-director of the 
Advancement Project, an organization advocating against harsh school punishments, “[p]unitive discipline leads to a higher dropout rate, more hostility in schools, it leads to kids disengaging from learning and it alienates parents.” 
Studies have consistently shown that having parents ac-
tively engaged in their child’s education improves student performance and academic achievement. 
Alienating parents by fining them, or even arresting them 
for a few cases of victimless tardiness, will do a lot more harm than good for the children’s enrichment. 
In this economy, when some parents have multiple jobs 
and countless other responsibilities, perhaps school districts around the country could lighten up a bit.

Do well in high school to attend college. 
Pass your courses in college. 
Get a good job. 
Contribute to America’s economy. 
This is the story of the successful American life.But that road to the top is no longer a road only 
for Americans. 
Asian and European workers have proven to be 
serious competition for Americans in recent years. Recent studies show that American students are performing worse than their Asian and European counterparts, which makes a future overtake of the American economy a threatening possibility.
Seeing that something is wrong with education, 
President Barack Obama, in his State of the Union address, proposed policies to enhance American public education and bring the U.S. back to the top. 
His proposals included requiring students to 
stay in school until they graduate or turn 18, in-creasing funding and replacing teachers “who just aren’t helping kids learn.” 
Like all of the recent endeavors to strengthen 
American education, these policies are only slight touch-ups to a damaged infrastructure. 
More money is not the answer. The website MAT@USC reported that the U.S., 
compared to 10 rival countries including Japan and South Korea, ranked seventh and eighth in science and math testing, respectively.
This is despite the U.S. spending the most money 
per student.  
Clearly there is not a problem with the amount of 
money we are shoveling into education.
No, the poor performance of American students 
does not stem from poor funding or teachers. 
While these things are important, there are two 
factors that are much more significant in a student’s academic performance.
One is the attitude of th student, and the other is 
the philosophy of the student. 
Human behavior is malleable and tends to be a 
reflection of one’s culture and society. 
A society valuing personal work ethic, education 
and perseverance will produce successful students. Such a society has no need for scrutinizing teachers or dropout laws.But much of the U.S. 
does not value the perse-verance and work ethic that is critical to a success-ful education. 
Much of the U.S. lacks 
this hardworking spirit and instead favors grade entitlement and inflation. 
The result is  masses of under-performing students being barely strung along through a system of test-based evaluations. 
The influence of society and culture on student 
performance is evident in comparisons of race. Even within the U.S., there are vast racial differences in student performance. 
A study from the Center on Education Policy in 
2008 found that, when looking at all grades, Asian-Americans outperformed white students in 51 per -
cent and 80 percent of instances in reading and math, respectively. 
Asian students are not inherently smarter than 
white students. 
At least, you won’t find any peer-reviewed, sci-
entific evidence proving they are. 
But Asian students tend to come from cultures 
that value perseverance, respect for authority and a strong work ethic.  
These are the qualities of a Confucian mindset, a 
mindset that engenders a respect for education, and leads to successful students.
Instead of reforming education, we should re-
form the society that produces poor students. 
If society as a whole does not value perseverance 
or respect teachers, then no amount of funding will fix education issues. 
Instead, if we refocus our efforts on reforming 
our society’s values themselves, students will learn not arithmetic or science but an earnest value of hard work, education and perseverance. 
These values will resolve issues with teacher 
quality and student performance. 
They’ll do better at arithmetic and science as a 
result, too.

Whether you dated 
him or her or it was just a fling, you 
broke up, whether you liked it or not.
It seems like most breakups 
go the same way: You swear you’ll be friends and that not even your split or all the hard feelings associated with it will get in the way.
Often, these “friendships” 
dissolve or fail to launch al-together because they aren’t friendships we want to main-tain, and we don’t seem to mind.
It’s important to not feel 
obligated to make a friendship out of a broken relationship. 
If you don’t want to be 
friends with your ex, don’t suggest it. Friendship post-breakup is never a require-ment.
However, some people are 
actually worth having around, our exes included.
When a guy I was dating 
broke off our relationship unexpectedly in June 2010, he asked if we would still be friends. I nodded, but I  doubt-ed the chances of that actually happening. 
We weren’t friends before 
we dated, and we probably wouldn’t be afterward.
As it turned out, we wound 
up being more than friends again only six weeks later. That is, until our relationship fell apart once more a month later.
That time, our split was 
amicable. We again agreed to be “friends,” but after two months of me suggesting plans and him blowing them off, I finally cut the thread that our so-called friendship hung by.
Just like after our first 
breakup, I figured I’d never see him again. 
I classified him as just a 
bygone. He was an ex who merely existed somewhere else and was reduced to only a few memories.
Despite all that, nine 
months later we were sip-ping cocktails downtown to-gether and reminiscing about the previous summer. It was a good time, so we hung out again.
Even though we shared the 
most dramatic relationship I’ve ever been in, I love spend-ing time with him now because I’ve stopped stressing about the barri-ers that existed in our 
relationships. I can finally en-joy an uncomplicated bond with him.
Our friendship still has 
certain boundaries that make it unique from my other ones. When it comes to being “just friends” with our exes, we must follow the cardinal rules of platonic friendship with exes.
CNN Living blogger Ami 
Angelowicz offers some rules about being friends after a breakup.
Her first rule is crucial to 
maintaining a solid friend-ship: Allow a mourning pe-riod, and let both hearts heal. 
This way, sexual tension or 
resentment is less of a threat. When these tensions burn out, a healthy friendship is pos-sible and may even be better than the relationship.
Above all, we must under-
stand our emotional boundar-ies. I love hanging out with my ex, but I make a point of keeping emotional distance, and I don’t mean that to insult or criticize him. I don’t rely on him when I’m upset, which Angelowicz also suggests. Keep the new friendship free of emotional entanglement that could make it compli-cated.
Finally, absolutely no 
hookups under any circum-stances, ever.
Slipping up once can make 
it harder to resist later, and it forces the former couple to re-assess the relationship. Hook-ing up post-breakup could cause both partners’ emotion-al progress to relapse, which complicates what is supposed to be a simple friendship. Friends with benefits are not actually friends. You’re either dating, or you’re a booty call.
Breakups don’t have to 
be the end-all be-all. There is nothing wrong with a healthy friendship after the fact. 
However, they are never 
obligatory.
With that said, we 
shouldn’t knock being friends post-breakup before we try it.
It could wind up being bet-
ter than the actual relation-ship.

University regulations specifically 
prohibit hazing, Machen said in his 
statement. Hazing is also illegal in the state of Florida.
At Florida Agricultural and Me-
chanical University , marching band drum major Robert Champion was beaten to death in November in what was deemed a hazing incident.  
The hazing at FAMU has drawn at-
tention to the issue, said Alpha Kappa Alpha parliamentarian and Student Government Division Chair for Cam-pus Life Sabine Justilien. Alpha Kappa Alpha is an unofficial sister sorority of Alpha Phi Alpha, she said.
Justilien said it’s hard to combat 
hazing when people aren’t as upfront about the issue as they should be.
She declined to comment on the 
specifics of the UF Alpha Phi Alpha hazing incident.
Students proved guilty of hazing 
could face expulsion and criminal charges, Machen said in his statement.
Derrious Robinson, president of 
UF’s Theta Sigma chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, could not be reached for comment.  8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2012

The Alachua County Commis-
sion decided Tuesday to consider 
changing part of the funding process for county nonprofit organizations.
The funding program, called the 
Community Agency Partnership Program, helps fund nonprofit or -
ganizations like the Early Learning Coalition, Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network and Catholic Chari-ties.
The process for funding begins 
when an organization fills out an application. On the application, the organization must specify what type of issues it provides services for.
Organizations currently file un-
der four categories: food, health care, housing/utilities and chil-dren’s programs. The commission decided to look into reducing the number of categories from four to two: those that provide food servic-es and those that provide child and family services.
The commission voted unani-
mously to pass the issue along to county staff. Commissioner Mike Byerly was absent.There was some disagreement 
about whether the reduction would 
over-complicate the application 
process.
“The applica-
tion process went beautifully last year,” said Lee Roberts, the direc-tor of the funding program. “There 
was no confusion. Each agency knew exactly what it fell under.” 
Roberts said having two catego-
ries may confuse organizations that want to apply. Because of the word-ing of the category names, Roberts worried people may think only pro-grams that provide child services will be awarded money under the second category.
Commissioner Lee Pinkoson, 
who came up with the two catego-ries, said there was no need for four categories.
“We cannot solve all of the coun-
ty’s problems,” Pinkoson said. “We should focus as much as possible on children and families because that is the root of the poverty issue.”
Anthony Clarizio, director of El-
derCare of Alachua County, said the commission should create a defini-tion for a “family .” Clarizio said the elderly should not be forgotten dur -ing that process.
“If everyone funds children and 
families, then there won’t be very many organizations left to fund se-niors,” Clarizio said.
Last year, the program awarded 
about $1 million to 27 county non-profit organizations. 
Commissioner Paula DeLaney 
said the amount of money given to the program will probably stay at about $1 million. However, because of upcoming cuts to the county’s budget, she said county money al-lotted to the funding program will not increase.
The commission is expected to 
discuss the funding program more at future commission meetings.

When 22 people were rushed to Shands 
at UF after a horrific series of car crashes 
on Interstate 75 on Jan. 29, the hospital was in desperate need of blood.
Thanks to the UF students who donat-
ed blood on campus during the previous week, LifeSouth Community Blood Center was able to fill that need.
“It’s a prime example of University of 
Florida students stepping up to the plate,” said Clay Gibbons, LifeSouth community development coordinator. “The recent do-nations were one of the only reasons we were able to fill such a massive order in such short time.”
LifeSouth, Gators Bleed Orange and 
Blue and the national organ and tissue donation initiative Get Carded will take their life-saving efforts to the next level at GatorSavers, a one-day event that teaches basic lifesaving techniques.
From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Feb. 11 in the 
Reitz Union Rion Ballroom, anyone can take CPR certification classes, give blood and sign up with bone marrow, organ and tissue registries.
Three two-hour CPR certification ses-sions, including instruction for using an automated external defibrillator, will be-gin at 9:30 a.m., noon and 2:30 p.m.
The certification course costs $5. Each 
session has a maximum enrollment of 150 people.
“It’s always good to be prepared in case 
of an emergency,” said Gators Bleed Or -ange and Blue President Jessie Cohen, 20. “It’s important for people to realize how necessary these skills are in order to allevi-ate a potentially dangerous situation.”
Cohen said GBOAB’s goals for the 
event are to certify 450 people in CPR with AED, collect 150 units of blood and have 150 people join lifesaving registries.
LifeSouth will register people with the 
National Bone Marrow Registry, while Get Carded will recruit people to join the Na-tional Organ and Tissue Registry.

HaZInG , from page 1Hazing not 
legal in state of FloridaInvestigators from seven counties collaborated
Elementary School.
Norman is one of two de-
fendants with known ties to the 
university . Matthew Gendron, 44, was arrested after telling a decoy that her 14-year-old sister could watch them have sex.
Gendron has worked for 
UF since 2001.  He was a physi-cian’s assistant with the univer -
sity’s college of critical care in the anesthesiology department.
He was placed on admin-
istrative leave with pay when the university found out about his arrest Saturday, UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes said.
“(Predators are) all walks 
of life,” said Sgt. Todd Kelly , spokesman for the Sheriff’s Of-fice at a press conference about the arrests. “What does a sexual predator look like? It looks like everyone in this room. It can be anybody.”
The investigation required 
two months of planning, about 40 investigators from through-out the state and an investment of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Officer Art Forgey of the Sheriff’s Office said the ex-act cost won’t be known for a couple months because the in-vestigation was complicated. Some of the money came from grants.
It was an opportune time 
to coordinate the operation, Assistant U.S. Attorney Frank Williams said at the press con-ference. In addition to GPD and the Sheriff’s Office, investiga-tors were brought in from seven other law enforcement agencies within the state.
Last week, investigators 
spent hours texting, exchanging emails and chatting on instant messenger services. 
Williams, who has worked 
on child predator cases for 22 years, hopes he can turn the in-vestigation into a federal case. Officers are still talking to the 21 men who were arrested, hoping 
the defen-
dants will tell them if they molest-ed children in the past.
Williams 
thanked the investiga-tors, who 
spent hours each day during the sting discussing “despicable acts.”
Suspects offered to teach 
teenagers how to have sex. Some demanded nude photos.
One suspect, Jermaine Da-
vis, 25, of Gainesville, brought a bottle of baby oil. When officers opened the door, he ran away.
He was caught soon after, 
and he had one desperate re-quest.
“Can y’all just shoot me?” he 
asked. “My life is over.”

Will Holland is a biology major, 
itching to explore other options.
Declaring his major at Preview was 
hectic, said the first-semester 18-year-
old. He was rushed, and because the health field interests him, he chose bi-ology.
He already wants to change it.The College of Liberal Arts and Sci-
ences’ “Explore our Majors” website aims to help students like Holland. The site, www.clas.ufl.edu/majors, presents 35 of the CLAS majors.
Since its launch last March, the 
page has 101,300 total views, accord-ing to data compiled by adviser Liz Kazungu.
Each page displays information 
about the major, including potential careers, course topics and opportuni-ties like research positions.
“It’s an opportunity for students to 
learn about majors that they might not know a lot about,” said college Dean Paul D’Anieri.
According to the Academic Advis-
ing Center website, 38 percent of UF students change majors by the end of their first year, and 61 percent switch by the end of their second year.
Students often stumble upon their 
interests in general education classes, D’Anieri said. Now, they can access the website for more information.
“Ultimately, the goal is that stu-
dents pick the major that inspires the most passion in them,” he said.KELLY PRICE

Starbucks Coffee Company stirred up 
more than frappuccinos this past week.
The Seattle-based coffee giant — along 
with other northwestern companies such as 
Amazon, Nike and Microsoft — backed a Washington state bill aimed at legalizing gay marriage and has received boycott threats for doing so.
Some UF students who frequent Starbucks 
said they support the company’s endorse-ment. They called it a bold, respectable move.
“I think that’s really exciting, actually ,” 
said Lauren Tripp, a 32-year-old doctoral can-didate in the College of Education. “I think a lot of companies are reluctant to do anything that would upset their shareholders. It’s cool that they take a stand for their morals over losing money.”
Animal biology freshman Alissa Valdes, 
18, agreed. She said she believes Starbucks could influence customers through its public support for gay rights.
“If Starbucks loves gay marriage, maybe 
then everybody else will, too,” she said.
The bill was passed by the Washington 
State Senate Feb. 1 and will be up for a vote in the state’s House as early as today. Both cham-bers have a Democratic majority, and Demo-cratic Gov. Christine Gregoire expressed her support. Passage is expected sometime next week.
Starbucks notified its employees of the en-dorsement in a message on Jan. 24.
“Starbucks strives to create a company 
culture that puts our partners first, and our company has a lengthy history of leading and supporting policies that promote equality and inclusion,” Executive Vice President Kalen Holmes wrote in the message. “This important legislation is aligned with Starbucks business practices and upholds our belief in the equal treatment of partners … We look forward to seeing this legislation enacted into law.”Robert Thomas, chair of the Warrington 
College of Business Administration’s De-partment of Management, said the decision shouldn’t negatively impact the coffee com-pany.
“I think it’s risky , especially if it doesn’t 
directly impact their core business,” he said. “Given that they are joining Microsoft and Nike, they probably have some cover and may have even had some pressure. I think it could actually help Starbucks business, [which] probably leans left of center in the crowd they attract.”
Some opposition toward the company 
arose when USA Christian Ministries Pastor Steven Andrew called for a national boycott of the company in a post on the ministry’s website. WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

Florida freshman Brad Beal (left) credited Kentucky for shutting down the Gators’ strength on offense — 3-point shooting. UF made just 6 of 27 attempts from three in the 78-58 loss. 
� GATORS SHOT 22 PERCENT 
FROM BEYOND THE ARC TUESDAY.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
LEXINGTON, Ky. — In the Gators’ 
two previous losses against top-three 
teams, outside shooting was their saving grace from an embarrassing final mar -
gin.
The 11 threes Florida made at No. 3 
Ohio State back in mid-November ta-pered a 16-point deficit to seven. Less than a month later, in a four-point loss to No. 2 Syracuse, nine UF 3-pointers helped the Gators keep within striking distance. 
But Tuesday night at Rupp Arena, 
the catalyst for transforming a seem-ingly insurmountable lead into a tight game never came as No. 8 Florida (19-5, 7-2 Southeastern Conference) fell to top-ranked Kentucky (24-1, 10-0 SEC) by 20 points. 
The Gators shot a season-low 22.2 
percent from three in the 78-58 loss and followed a 2-of-9 performance in the opening half with a 4-for-18 dry spell in the second, allowing the crowd of 24,389 to begin its march toward the exits with more than four minutes left.
“That’s just part of their coaching; that 
was great coaching and great scouting,” guard Brad Beal said. 
“They know that we’re a 3-point 
shooting team and they took our best strength away from us.”
Beal, a freshman, scored 14 points for 
Florida on 1-of-7 shooting from 3-point range.  Only two other Gators — Erik Murphy and Kenny Boynton, who led UF with 18 points — made a shot from behind the arc.
Kentucky, meanwhile, had three play-
ers nail more than two threes. 
Along with the bottomless supply of 
lob dunks from 16-point scorer Anthony Davis and transition points courtesy of fellow freshman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who chipped in 13, the talented Wildcats stretched the Gators’ defense even fur-ther with nine 3-pointers on 15 attempts.
“Our defense was terrible, so really 
it was an overall, all-around, totally bad game,” Beal said. “All credit goes out to them, so we just have to come out next game and be ready and prepare.” 
The 60-percent shooting performance 
was a season-high for Kentucky — 10 percent higher than its previous best. The last time the Wildcats made 50 percent of their shots from deep was in late Decem-ber against Lamar.
A pair of 3-pointers late in the first 
half by Doron Lamb, who led UK with 18 points, typified Florida’s lax defense, according to UF coach Billy Donovan.
“The two threes at the end were prob-
ably ones that we could have done a little Florida cold from three in 
20-point loss at Kentucky

LEXINGTON, Ky. — For 5-foot-8-inch 
Erving Walker, Kentucky was too tall of a 
test.
Against one of the nation’s longest and 
most athletic teams, Florida’s starting point guard was shut out for the first time since Dec. 30, 2008. 
“It just wasn’t his night,” Kenny Boyn-
ton said. 
Walker’s scoreless showing snapped a streak of 117 straight games with a point, a stretch that dates back to midway through his freshman season. 
He missed all seven of his shot attempts, 
including four from beyond the arc, and tallied just one assist compared to two turnovers. 
His primary matchup, Kentucky fresh-
man Marquis Teague, scored 12 points on 4-of-6 shooting with 10 assists and five turnovers.
“That was a matchup [Tuesday] that 
probably really hurt us,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “That was something that was a big difference in the game.”
Often drawing the 
6-foot-2 Teague or 6-foot-4 Doron Lamb, Walker struggled to get around his defenders and com-plete passes over their 
long, athletic frames. 
When Kentucky 
brought full-court pres-
sure, Walker sometimes faced 6-foot-7 Michael Kidd-Gilchrist or 6-foot-8 Darius Miller, which only made matters worse. 
“That’s one of the things that makes 
them very, very good is they have great length,” Donovan said. “Teague has got good speed and quickness and can pres-sure.”
Kentucky consistently recruits players 
with that skill set, and it has consistent-ly given Walker fits during the last two years. 
In Tuesday’s game and three matchups 
with Kentucky last season, Walker aver -
aged 6.8 points per game on just 16.2 per -
cent shooting with a combined 10 assists and eight turnovers.

night?74%   NO

118 total votessecond-lowest offensive output of the season. The Gators’ 
only worse performance was a 56-point showing on the road against Tennessee on Jan. 7. 
This mirrors the effect Walker’s struggles against the Wild-
cats had last year. In three games against Kentucky, Florida averaged eight points below its season average.  
“It makes it tougher for all the other players to score be-
cause (opponents) start keying on other players,” Boynton said of Walker’s off nights. “We need everyone out there, all five guys, to score.”
History shows Florida is at its best when it has balanced 
scoring. The teams that won national championships in 2006 and 2007 had five players average double figures, and last year’s Elite Eight squad had five players average at least nine points per game. 
Only three players scored more than seven points for UF on 
Tuesday, and those struggles took the offense out of rhythm. 
“We were coming down, one pass, shot,” Boynton said, 
“instead of running our plays like we should have.”
Despite Tuesday’s performance, freshman Brad Beal said 
he has no concerns about Walker’s ability to bounce back. 
With 131 career games under his belt, Florida’s lone senior 
has learned how to handle the ups and downs of good and bad nights. 
Walker responded to his previous season low — a three-
point showing in a Dec. 31 win against Yale — by exploding for a season-high 23 in Florida’s next game. 
“Erv just has to keep playing,” Beal said. “He’s been in the 
battles before, he knows what to do. So he just has to stay confident and keep playing basketball. I’m really not worried about him.”

WALKER , from page 13Walker’s struggles put 
Gators out of rhythmTop-ranked Wildcats led by 12 at half
bit better job,” Donovan said. 
“One was in transition and 
(Will) Yeguete got caught on 
Lamb … and then again, I thought he got a little bit too far on the wing and they kicked it to him and he knocked down the second one.”
The six points by Lamb 
pushed the Wildcats’ halftime lead to 12. Florida opened the second half with a 4-0 run, but Kentucky answered with an 11-0 run of its own fueled by 3-point-ers from point guard Marquis Teague and Darius Miller.
Despite 13 second-half points 
by Boynton on three 3-pointers, a layup and two free throws, the Gators never again closed the gap to less than 16. 
“We’ve been in positions a 
lot this year where we’ve lost,” Boynton said. “We responded well previously. You’ve got to come out and be excited. We’ve got Tennessee next, and we’ve got to come out and practice hard.”

It took Joanna Mather just less than an 
hour to defeat her opponent on Tuesday, 
but it was an extra 15 minutes on Monday that really made the difference.
The Florida senior played by far her best 
match of this young season, defeating South Florida’s Danielle Mills 6-1, 6-0 and lead-ing the Gators to a 7-0 sweep of the Bulls. Mather, currently ranked fourth in the na-tion in singles play, started the season rela-tively slow. Tuesday, it all came together.
“I feel like I was playing really well 
[Tuesday],” she said. “I didn’t make as many mistakes as I made in the past few matches.”
After losing in three sets to Baylor’s Sona Novakova on Saturday, Mather came back with a vengeance on Tuesday, asserting herself as one of the country’s best players. It all started with extra work on Monday. Her forehand came up short in previous matches, so at Monday’s practice, Mather worked on that shot for an extended time. 
“She played OK at Baylor,” Florida 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “Her fore-hand maybe wasn’t as sharp, but she spent maybe 15 or 20 minutes extra on it [Mon-day], and it looked like it really helped.”
Mather noticed the difference on Tues-
day. She looked dominant against her op-ponent from USF, dropping only one game the entire match and looking in control the entire time.
“My forehand felt very good,” Mather 
said. “I was having trouble getting it deep in the Baylor match, and [Tuesday] it felt great.”
Thornqvist, too, saw the improvement. 
Getting one of his best singles players back in top form will go a long way in the com-ing weekend, when the Gators will travel to face No. 26 Pepperdine and No. 2 Stan-ford.
“She was hitting the ball fantastically,” 
Thornqvist said. “Losing one game is pret-ty impressive.”
Mather also played exceptionally well 
in doubles, as she and teammate Lauren Embree won their match 8-0 in just 28 min-utes. The pair continued their strong play against South Florida on Tuesday. They were switching well, making great contact and making almost no unforced errors in their very impressive win.
This weekend, Mather will look to con-tinue her upswing. She will need to be playing her best tennis in order to defeat the elite competition, especially second-ranked Stanford.
“A lot of things were working for me to-
day,” Mather said. “I feel like each match I’ve played I’ve gotten better and better, so hopefully I can stay up there.”

Florida started off its spring schedule on the right foot 
with a team win and an individual win for junior T.J. Vo-
gel at the Sea Best Invitational last week. But the Gators are working on consistency before hosting the SunTrust Gator Invitational on Saturday. 
So far this season the Gators have two wins, two sev-
enth-place finishes and a 10th-place finish, much more er -
ratic than last season, when they had two wins, a second-place finish and a third-place finish at this point in the year.
One of the team’s top players, junior Tyler McCumber, 
had a poor first round (83) at the tournament last week before finishing with two under-par rounds (69, 71).
“What I’ve seen from my team, including the fall, is 
some very typical inconsistent play from a young team that is rebuilding,” coach Buddy Alexander said.The need for rebuilding the team comes from losing 
two All-America seniors (Bank Vongvanij and Andres Echavarria) and an All-America sophomore (Phillip Choi) who left Florida to go play professionally. This left the 
team with one senior, three juniors and six freshmen.
Last week in Ponte Vedra, the Gators’ 
lineup was made up of one senior, three juniors and a freshman. But that could change, as upperclassmen Tommy Mou and Michael Furci both had the highest scores of the team for the tournament, 
finishing tied for 43rd and 20th, respec-
tively.
“(Mou and Furci) are working hard because they got 
people breathing down their necks to get in that lineup,” Alexander said.
Two of the freshmen who are threats to Mou and Furci 
are Eric Banks, who played last week, and J.D. Tomlinson, who did not. Banks shot a 223 (+7) total, leading him to tie for 11th along with McCumber.
Alexander also went on to say there’s no questioning 
that Tomlinson will be part of his top five by the end of the year. 
“One thing that’s happening on this team is the gap be-
tween those five guys and the other guys that weren’t in that tournament is closing very quickly,” Alexander said.
Mou has been working a lot on his swing since com-
ing back from the tournament and played well in practice Monday. Meanwhile, Furci has been working on his put-ting, which he struggled with the most in Ponte Vedra, according to Alexander.
At the SunTrust Gator Invitational this weekend, Alex-
ander plans to play a couple of individuals so some of the younger players can gain experience. 
“It’s possible that we might go to the NCAA (Champi-
onship) this year with two juniors and three freshmen,” Alexander said. Gators may look to underclassmen as season progresses

� THE FRESHMAN RANKS NEAR THE 
TOP IN THE COUNTRY IN ALL-AROUND AVERAGE THIS SEASON.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
 
When Kytra Hunter first set foot on the 
mat in her collegiate debut, success soon fol-
lowed.
After five meets, Hunter has become a 
major contributor for the Gators, compet-ing in every match and winning all-around titles in her first three competitions. 
Hunter averages 39.23 as an all-around 
competitor, which is good for 19th nation-ally. She also has the sixth-highest floor ex-ercise average in the country (9.89). 
In addition, Hunter has earned two 
Southeastern Conference Freshman Gym-nast of the Week honors.
“Kytra is just all business,” coach Rhonda 
Faehn said. “She gets her job done, gets her work done … and will continue to push her -
self to the limit.”
But Hunter’s stellar freshman campaign, 
which so far is reminiscent of Alaina John-son’s in 2011 and Ashanée Dickerson’s in 2010, hasn’t been without its flaws. 
In two home meets against Illinois-Chi-
cago and top-ranked Arkansas, Hunter re-corded a 9.275 on beam and a 9.35 on un-even bars, respectively.
“I did fall on beam and I knew that I can-
not let my team down,” Hunter said after UF’s home opener against UIC. “I just had to get myself refocused.”
Most newcomers would let freshman 
mistakes damage their confidence or linger. Not only has Hunter brushed them off, but she has also learned from her past errors. 
Against then-No. 6 Alabama in a 197.725-
196.900 loss last Friday, Hunter tied for second as an all-around competitor with a 39.45. 
In a relatively clean performance that 
featured no major falls or miscues, Hunter didn’t score less than a 9.85 in any event.
“It was her first opportunity in an en-
vironment like that as a freshman and she wasn’t rattled at all,” Faehn said. “She wasn’t bothered by almost 13,000 fans. That was great to see her response and the way she competed with maturity.”
Hunter’s composure seems innate, but 
her discipline is something she acquired during her time in the elite-level squad at Hill’s Gymnastics in Maryland. 
Hunter said following in the footsteps 
of U.S. Olympians Dominique Dawes, Elise Ray and Courtney Kupets, who also compet-ed for Hill’s Gymnastics, helped her learn a lot about self control.  
Her club coach, Kelli Hill, also taught her 
how to be disciplined in the gym at a young age. 
“I just carry [my discipline] in the gym 
and off of it,” Hunter said. “It’s just made me a stronger person.” 
When No. 4 Florida hosts No. 14 LSU 
in its annual Link to Pink meet, Hunter will compete against freshmen of a similar breed. 
The Tigers’ Rheagan Courville, Jes-
sie Jordan and Lloimincia Hall, who make up LSU’s young core, have all earned SEC Freshman of the Week honors this year. Courville edged out Hunter this week to win the accolade after winning four of five individual titles and scoring a 39.45 as an all-arounder against Kentucky. 
While Hunter has been on a hot streak 
lately, Faehn said that she might rest Hunter from floor Friday night for the first time this season.
“She has just really been an unbeliev-
able freshman up to this point,” Faehn said. “I have no doubt that she’ll continue to be amazing out there.”Hunter excelling as all-around competitor in first year at UF
