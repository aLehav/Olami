CLINCHED THE SEC EAST WITH THE WIN.

The Gators threw a blue-out, 
and the Gamecocks blew out their title hopes.
Florida entered The Swamp 
with a revived offense and fan base Saturday night, but by the fourth quarter, UF had flat-lined and thousands of blue-clad supporters 
were on their way home.
No. 22 South Carolina dealt No. 
24 UF a crushing 36-14 defeat in 
front of 90,855, ending the Gators’ hopes of a season-salvaging trip to the Southeastern Conference Championship. 
Now, the only way Florida is 
going to Atlanta is if it’s offered a bid to the Chick-fil-A Bowl.
With their goal of an SEC title 
gone, the Gators will have to find other motivation for their last two games, such as sending the senior class out with wins against Appa-lachian State and Florida State.
“I’m not a quitter,” safety Ah-mad Black said. “I don’t think any-body on our team is a quitter. We’ll stick together and fight through it.”
Saturday’s game had all the 
hype of a title bout, with UF coach Urban Meyer saying he wanted it “to go down in the books.”
It did, but in the wrong book.The Gamecocks locked down 
the SEC East for the first time in school history and got their first-
ever win in Gainesville. South Car -
olina coach Steve Spurrier notched 
his first victory at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium from the visiting sideline, snapping Florida’s streak of 16 
straight wins against division foes.
It was the Gators’ worst home 
defeat since LSU beat them 36-7 
in 2002, and it handed them three straight losses in The Swamp for 
the first time since 1986.
“Our guys were ready for this 
week. They gave us everything 
they had in practice, and obviously, it’s a severe letdown,” Meyer said.
Florida came into the game 
with a revamped strategy: a three-quarterback system that was sup-posed to give the Gators plenty of options to fix a struggling offense.
But nothing worked.Not John Brantley’s arm against 
the SEC’s worst pass defense. He totaled 46 yards and an intercep-tion through three quarters, rarely taking a shot downfield.
Not the three-man weave at 
quarterback, which wasn’t used often or effectively.
Gainesville Police arrest man accused in November 5 robbery
A Gainesville man was arrested last 
Wednesday in connection with a robbery Nov . 5 during which police say he struck the victim several times on the face. 
According to a police report, Michael Wims 
Jr. was charged with unarmed robbery , felony battery and possession of marijuana. He stole about $95 and a diamond earring worth $1,200 from Michael Rennold Madrazo. 
He had arranged to meet Madrazo, and 
when he did he struck him on the face with a hard object, knocking him to the ground. Wims then continued to hit the victim on the face. 
A witness told him to stop and stayed with 
the victim until an ambulance arrived. 
Officers found 3.4 grams of marijuana in 
his pocket.  
Wims said he hit the victim because he was 
concerned the victim was going to hit him first. He denied taking the money or the earring.

UF Police Department officials are con-
cerned about students’ ignorance of bike safety laws in a county that ranks as the  sec-ond most dangerous in Florida. 
These rankings, which appeared in an 
article from the Bradenton Herald, may be a result of the fact that Florida is such a bike-friendly state, said UPD Lt. Robert Wagner.
“More people on bikes statistically means 
more accidents,” he said.
Most bicycle accidents that UPD encoun-ters involve a car, but these are just reported incidents. Wagner said that many minor in-cidents go unreported on campus.
The main cause for such a high number of 
accidents on UF’s campus is students’ lack of concern for safety laws, Wagner said. 
By law, cyclists are considered vehicles 
while on the road and therefore must follow 
all car laws.
Dan Harcha, a junior me-
chanical engineering major at UF, works at the Student Gov-
ernment Free Bike Repair and said that some circumstances require bikers to consider themselves as cars more than others.

For Master Sgt. Jim Yakubsin, 
coming home from the Vietnam War 
wasn’t easy . 
“Vietnam was televised, and 
many people looked at us weird 
when we got back because of the im-
ages they saw on TV ,” he said.
But on Sunday at the first-annual 
All American Liberty Fest, Yakubsin felt like his service was appreciated. 
“The Vietnam guys made me feel 
what I did was right,” he said.
About 1,000 people came togeth-
er at Santa Fe College to honor vet-
erans, ranging from WWII to Iraq, at 
the festival.
The event was sponsored by San-
ta Fe’s Collegiate V eterans Society and replaced the Bikers on Parade event that had been held for the past nine years.
All of the proceeds raised would 
benefit the Gainesville Fisher House 
Foundation, according to Patti Fabi-
ani, executive director of the founda-tion. 
The foundation is raising money 
to build a  house on the grounds of the veterans hospital to serve veter -
ans and their families while they are 
being treated for surgery and serious 
illness, Fabiani said. Construction is expected to begin in the fall of 2011.
“Being that it’s our first year, I’m 
not sure how much we will raise, but 
having young kids learning more about what our veterans do for our 
country is really important,” Sandra Torres-Pintos, an event coordinator, said.
There were 18 veteran organiza-
tions, ranging from the Iwo Trio to the Korean War Veteran Association. Each of these organizations had rep-resentatives that spoke about their experiences in combat or how they support the veteran community in Alachua County. 
Warrant Officer Clif J. Cormier 
served in the 3rd marine division in the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. Cormier, who is 90 years old, said the event was special to him because it helps keep the memories alive. 
“I get to share my experience of 
65 years ago to anyone that asks,” he said.
Cormier, along with his two 
friends who served in the 4th and 5th marine divisions, founded Iwo Trio so people can learn and discuss the Battle of Iwo Jima and other ma-jor battles of WWII. 
Jackson Sasser, president of SFC,  
said that the liberty festival was one of the most important events the col-lege has ever been involved with.
“It’s events like these that are the 
real treasures of our community ,” he said. 
Joe Galloway , co-author of “We 
Were Soldiers Once…And Young,” which was made into a film star -
ring Mel Gibson in 2002, was a guest speaker.  
During his speech, he expressed 
his gratitude toward veterans and 
spoke about his experience as a re-
porter in the Vietnam War.
“I’m here to say thank you, a sim-
ple thank you to the men and wom-en who let nightmares erupt their sleep,” Galloway said.  “I owe you my life, some of you literally .  I can never pay for that, but I can try.”
After Galloway’s speech, Sasser 
dedicated The Liberty Oak, a memo-rial on SFC’s campus, to all the vet-erans in attendance at the festival. He also recognized several veterans, including some who earned the Pur -
ple Heart for their acts of service.
Sasser said the festival will be an 
annual event and that the outcome for its first year was inspiring.
“I don’t want to know anyone 
who doesn’t respect the warrior,” Sasser said.  “These are the people I respect — those who fight and sacri-fice their lives for our country.”

Since the Shands Arts in 
Medicine program started 
Art in Motion, a program for Parkinson’s disease patients, Kathy Castle has been par -
ticipating in the classes every week making mosaics, collag-es and other crafts.
Castle was just one of the 
artists who proudly displayed 
their work Sunday at the first 
Shands Arts and Health Festi-val.
About 75 Shands patients 
and festival-goers  participat-
ed in activities such as T-shirt painting, Zumba and yoga 
classes. 
Events like this, Castle said, 
are good ways for Parkinson’s disease patients and other pa-tients to get out of the house or hospital room and do some-
thing fun that allows them to 
mingle with others. 
“Art can make a huge dif-
ference in the healing envi-ronment and the hospital ex-
perience,” said Alie Wickham, 
program assistant for Shands Arts in Medicine. 
“We need people to be in-
volved to help this field grow and develop,” she said.
Shands Arts in Medicine 
was started in 1990 and cur -
rently works with Shands at 
UF, the Shands Cancer Hospi-
tal and surrounding clinics.
The program helps to fa-
cilitate creative art activities 
and bring the arts to patients 
in local  hospitals, according 
to Wickham.
The program 
has various classes 
available for pa-
tients in areas such as dance, 
music, literary arts and visual arts.
Chip Colley, 54, was diag-
nosed with Parkinson’s dis-ease nearly two years ago.
Now, he’s an artist within 
Shands Arts in Medicine pro-
gram. 
“I couldn’t draw until I got 
Parkinson’s,” Colley said. “I 
really started enjoying art.”
The festival was held pri-
marily to raise awareness about arts and health and to support the community, Wick-ham said.
“Art is not an alternative 
to the health care that Shands provides,” Wickham said. “It is a complement. Patients 
need to heal spiritually along 
with physically, and art can play a key role in that.”Shands patients get artsy4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2010

GATOR NATION

At Florida State University’s 
law school, deep within the en-
emy’s camp, there occasionally hangs a sign that says, “Work ‘Em Silly, Gators.”
This icon of The Swamp, 
painted on a pillowcase, is hung by the Litigators, a student-run organization within FSU’s law school that provides a home away 
from home for the numerous UF 
graduate students that attend the college. 
Sometimes, it serves as a re-
cruitment tool during times when 
prospective students come and 
visit the school, said president Kim Siomkos, who, like most Liti-gators, is a UF graduate. 
The group wants Gainesville 
students to know that despite going to a rival school, there is a group of people who share a com-mon bond — being a Gator.
“Gainesville will always be my 
home,” Siomkos said. “So any-thing I can do to remind me of be-ing there is something that I want 
to get involved in.”
The group primarily func-
tions as a social group and a way 
for students from Gainesville to network with other law students 
with UF undergraduate degrees 
who found their way up north to Tallahassee. 
They host game-day tailgates 
and game-watching parties, hold monthly meetings, go to Gator baseball games when they play FSU and also host various events like beer tastings with the Capital 
Area Gator Club. 
One of the group’s biggest 
events is their UF-FSU rivalry 
week, which was hosted last week  
so as not to coincide with exams. 
“We try to have it in early No-
vember before the studying for 
exams gets too overwhelming or too hectic so people can still par -
ticipate and have a good time,” said treasurer Brett Miller.
During the week, the stairwell 
of the school is decorated on one side with orange and blue and the other side in garnet and gold, 
complete with the slogans, “If 
you’re not a Gator, then you’re Gator bait,” and “Gator haters.” 
The week also includes a pow-
derpuff game, a canned food drive 
and a Mr. FSU pageant.
The school’s administration 
seems pleased with the group, 
even though it is dedicated to 
proving its loyalty to a rival 
school.
“They’re very, very helpful to 
our school,” said Don Weidner, the dean of FSU College of Law.  
“UF is a terrific undergraduate 
Student Body, and to be sure, we very actively recruit undergradu-ate UF students, and they’re very 
active in that effort.”
One of the reasons Weidner 
said a organization like Litigators is helpful is because of the sheer 
volume of UF graduates that the college receives.  In two out of the last three incoming classes of 
law students, UF graduates have 
outnumbered the graduates from every other university, including FSU. 
Siomkos said she enjoys hav-
ing the backing of the administra-tion. 
“This is one of the selling 
points for me for FSU Law,” she 
said, “the fact that an entire facul-
ty and administration can get be-hind us and realize we’re not here to be an annoyance, we’re here to be an asset.”Alumni take Gator

UF graduate and litigator� TRENDS SHOW FERTILITY IS DROPPING IN 
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
By ERIC HENELY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A study released last week shows that high heat from 
laptops could lead to a shortage of power below the belt 
for men. 
The study, which was published online in the journal 
Fertility and Sterility, shows there might be a potential 
link between decreased fertility for men and heat from 
laptops.
Leg position is a primary factor, said Dr. Denis Healey, 
a urologist at Bay Medical Center in Panama City who completed his residency at UF. 
He believes that laptop trays, which are designed to cool the bottom of a laptop, are not as effective as simply keeping an open-leg position.
It’s one of the most heat-sensitive areas of the body, 
and just a few degrees of temperature change can pro-
foundly affect performance, he said.
“I believe that there is going to be a lot 
more fertility problems in the future as a result of laptop usage,” Healey said.
After avoiding heat for six months to 
a year, sperm counts can increase back to normal.
However, Healey warned that the 
longer the period of heat exposure, the 
more permanent the damage becomes.
Under a microscope, he said that he can easily tell 
which sperm have been damaged by heat.
“The sperm have blown-up heads. A lot of them will either have no tails or very short tails. It’s very notice-able,” he said.
Dr. Johannes Vieweg, chairman of the Department of 
Urology at UF, said the study is part of a larger effort to determine why fertility rates are dropping in developed countries.
There are alarming trends, particularly in Europe, that 
suggest that infertility is becoming more pronounced, he said.
Both doctors agree on the importance of prevention 
and a simple self-examination that can detect many tes-
ticular and fertility problems. 
If men do notice changes, Vieweg recommends that 
they go to the doctor without being ashamed.
“Urology isn’t something that naturally calls to you,” 
Healey said. “If we can prevent this from becoming a 
problem, everyone benefits.”Laptop heat may cause reversible male infertility

� THE GOAL IS TO MAKE STUDENTS 
AWARE OF GLOBAL ISSUES.
By GRETCHEN GORDIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students and faculty will have the 
opportunity to celebrate the benefits of 
international education and exchange this 
week.
Mabel Cardec, outreach coordinator for 
the UF International Center, said the events 
during International Education Week are offered at UF to make people aware of the importance of global issues.
“The Gator Nation is everywhere 
around the world — not just on campus or in Gainesville,” Cardec said. “We need stu-dents in higher education to realize this to prepare for their future careers.”
This year’s theme, “Making Global Con-
nections,” will highlight opportunities available for international engagement on 
campus and around the world.
The kick-off event is today at 10:15 a.m. 
with a brief opening ceremony in the Hub 
highlighting the week’s activities with a mini-concert featuring UF’s African choir. 
The UF College of Education is also host-ing an event today at 12:30 p.m. in Norman Hall with international food and panels of students and faculty about how their in-ternational experiences have affected their work.  
Dean Rockwell, a UFIC study abroad 
adviser, said students who study abroad 
can discover so much by learning in a dif-ferent environment. 
“Your ability to learn is amazing when 
you’re abroad,” Rockwell said. “Learning 
customs from new people that speak a dif-ferent language presents a good opportu-nity to grow as a person.”
On Friday, UFIC will host “NGO/PVO 
Day: Extending International Collabora-tion and Networking” from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
in the Reitz Union Auditorium and Grand 
Ballroom Salon A and E.
“We have so many international stu-
dents here so it’s nice to have events that will interest those students and show how internationally diverse UF is,” he said.International week to showcase opportunities abroad

On a cloudless night, Earthlings gathered to get a closer 
look at the universe.
More than 900 people attended Starry Night, an annual 
public stargazing event, on Friday to  peer through tele-scopes and peruse astronomy  exhibits at the Florida Mu-
seum of Natural History.
“There’s something about the grandeur of the sky that gets people excited,” said Vicki Sarajedini, an associate pro-
fessor of astronomy and one of the event planners.
There were telescopes that could focus on Jupiter so well 
that viewers could see the four Galilean moons next to the 
planet.
A meteorite, owned by Santa Fe College, 
which weighs more than 70 pounds, sat in a bed of sand inside the museum on display for 
visitors.
A portable planetarium was inflated for a show about constellations. 
Children used black plastic cups, CDs, pipe cleaners and 
glitter glue to build their own model black holes.
Alison Klesman, an astronomy Ph.D. student, said as-
tronomy is a field that a lot of people like because it’s so 
visual, and they can relate to that.
Also, she said the public doesn’t always get a chance to 
see space through high-powered telescopes.
“People don’t get a lot of access to do things like this,” 
she said.Museum hosts night of stargazing, black-hole building“The Gator Nation is everywhere

Rep. Shuler segmenting 
Democrats
Just when everyone thought things couldn’t get any worse for the Democrats in Congress with the wreckage still be-ing cleaned from precincts across the country and the 
Capitol nearly oozing blue blood down its steps, in walks 
little-known Rep. Heath Shuler to shake things up. 
Shuler, a North Carolina Democrat, announced Sunday he 
would challenge current Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi 
in her run for leader of the now-minority party in the House 
of Representatives. 
Saying that allowing Pelosi to continue to lead the Demo-
crats in the House is “unacceptable,” Shuler said he’s going to “press forward” in forcing Pelosi to fight for the leader -
ship.

well, too liberal, Shuler also said he’s the better moderate choice to Pelosi’s tree-hugging, health-care-lauding West Coast style for the Democrats.
And Shuler knows he can’t win. Adding he doesn’t have the votes to beat the powerhouse 
that is Pelosi, Shuler’s challenge acts more as a warning to 
Democrats in Congress fighting for “liberal” things like so-
cial welfare and health care. 
And after a “shellacking” in the midterm elections, Demo-
crats don’t need in-party quarreling. Although Shuler might have good intentions to bring his party a little to the right to 
appease more voters come 2012, Shuler is only further seg-
menting his already-injured party. 
We’re just looking forward to Pelosi hopefully singing her 
own rendition of Beyonce’s “To the left, to the left.”
Graphic design
Cigarettes are getting 
graphic.
After an announce-
ment Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration 
said it would make the first 
major change to cigarette packaging in more than 25 years by requiring ciga-rette companies to include graphic warnings above the brand name of each box of cigarettes.
A mere warning from the 
Surgeon General admonish-ing smokers not to light up while pregnant or a, “Hey, you might get cancer,” warning isn’t cutting it any-more for the FDA. 
The definitely-not-
suitable-for-picture-books graphics will display images 
ranging from decaying teeth 
to a corpse in an attempt to persuade smokers to put down the pack for good. 
And when the Centers 
for Disease Control and Pre-vention estimates smokers cost America $193 billion annually in lost productiv-ity and health care costs, we couldn’t be happier with 
the extra efforts the FDA is 
making to put an end to this deadly habit that holds the dubious title as the No. 1 cause of preventable death in America. 
But, at the same time, we 
realize smokers are more than aware of the dangers 
associated with lighting up. 
Smokers know each time they choose to smoke they cut minute after minute off their lives. Smokers have seen the images of tar-black, tobacco-tainted lungs. 
So, although we fully 
support the graphic warn-
ing labels or any other sen-
sible measure to prevent deaths from tobacco abuse, we realize smokers are still going to smoke. 
And that’s a shame.Olbermann should look to Fox for example
So apparently Keith Olbermann supports Democrats. 
Fancy that. 
A little more than a week ago, the MSNBC talk-
show host was suspended because he violated NBC guide-lines about giving campaign donations. The punishment for this was an “indefinite suspension,” a phrase we know all too well in Gainesville. Right, Chris Rainey?
Fortunately for Olbermann, the reaction of bleeding 
blue hearts across the country, plus the horrific thought of what would happen to MSNBC ratings without him, re-sulted in his suspension lasting for a horrifyingly anxiety-
invoking two business days. 
You can’t really blame Olbermann’s bosses, though. 
Technically, he did break the rule by donating the maxi-
mum legal amount to three Democrat candidates. 
But did he really break the spirit of the rule? The rule 
was designed to protect the journalistic integrity of those 
working for NBC’s non-biased hard-news shows. That 
makes sense, and it’s actually a pretty good rule that ex-ists for all The New York Times and The Washington Post journalists. 
But is anyone not dying from a bleeding heart really 
going to sit there and tell me “Countdown with Keith Ol-bermann” is a non-biased, hard-news show? That same person would also probably be quick to tell me Glenn Beck hands out hugs to Democrats walking down the street. Truth is we all know where Olbermann’s loyalties lie, and there’s nothing wrong with that. If you don’t like his opinions, change the channel to Fox News. But as the face of an opinionated show, should he really be held ac-countable to the same rules as the journalists who work for the hard-news shows of NBC?
There is precedent for news companies allowing its 
hosts to donate money. In fact, all we have to do is look to Olbermann’s favorite conversa-tion piece to find an example of this. Fox News does, in fact, allow its employees to donate to campaign funds, a rule its hosts take advantage of quite often. This past campaign cycle Fox’s parent company, News Corp., dished out $1.25 million in campaign donations. Of course, Ol-
bermann did publicly make fun of Fox for that, which is all-too-ironic now. 
There is another way of looking at this, though. The 
amount of face time opinionated shows give candidates running for office is worth a lot more to them than the $2,400 Olbermann was legally allowed to donate. On shows like “Countdown,” you don’t see many non-liberal 
faces very often, if ever. Meaning, all of the time they al-
locate on their shows to doing interviews is basically one 
long, free advertisement for the candidates. So, in that case, everyone hosting an opinionated show is donating to a campaign by means of saving them money. If MSN-BC took that route, it’d be running a lot of reruns during prime time. 
The real question here is why doesn’t MSNBC just re-
move the rule and take the Fox approach? For once, sur -
prisingly, I think Fox got something right. How does it make any sense to punish a TV broadcast journalist for giving contributions when, in reality, he or she is doing the same thing every time he or she has a guest on his or her show? 
Somehow, though, I don’t think Olbermann will admit 
Fox got this one right — at least not in as many words.

Letters to the Editor
Israel’s relationship with U.S. vital 
Some political commentators argue Is-
rael is a strategic liability to the foreign 
policy interests of the United States and 
that America would benefit from lessening 
or cutting ties with Israel.  Although the U.S.-Israel alliance, just like any alliance, isn’t perfect, the commonalities and inten-
sive cooperation between Israel and the 
U.S. make Israel an indispensable Ameri-can ally.
Common values ensure the foundation 
for the unbreakable bond between Israel 
and the U.S.; Israel is the only functioning 
democracy in a part of the world that con-tains mostly autocratic regimes susceptible to radical coups at any time. 
Israel is the only country in the Middle 
East that grants full rights to women, re-ligious minorities and gay people and protects free speech and freedom of the press.
As a beacon for democracy and human 
rights in the Middle East, Israel is the only nation in the region with which support for the U.S. is guaranteed. This guaranteed support remains critical as Israel and the U.S. confront common enemies. 
The U.S. receives a substantial bargain 
annually by supplying Israel with secu-rity assistance that enables Israel to fight terrorism and America’s enemies without 
forcing the U.S. to commit troops on the 
ground.
Israel’s location allows it to serve as a 
strategic American outpost in a region vi-tal to America’s energy considerations and 
foreign policy interests. In addition to pro-
viding bases for the U.S. military to refuel planes and restock ships, Israel has shared vital intelligence with the U.S. Israel is the U.S.’ strongest ally in addressing the threat of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons 
capability. 
Israel frequently contributes its inno-
vative prowess and cutting-edge tech-
nologies to the U.S. military in the form of life-saving equipment, including the emer -
gency bandage and armor-plated tanks. 
Israel ultimately provides an irreplace-
able wealth of resources and knowledge for America’s strategic interests in the Middle East.
While detractors argue Israel negative-
ly affects America’s relationship with the Arab world, America’s historically strong relations with several key Arab govern-ments render that argument somewhat 
inaccurate. 
Additionally, many of those in the 
Middle East who despise Israel do so be-
cause they perceive Israel as an extension of America. This is clearly evident at anti-
Israel demonstrations, where American 
and Israeli flags are burned beside each other and demonstrators refer to America as the “Big Satan” and Israel as the “Little 
Satan.”
I encourage every student at UF to at-
tend the Israel Week events sponsored by 
the Jewish Student Union because Israel is beyond a Jewish cause; supporting Israel 
is American.  For more information on Is-
rael Week, visit the Jewish Student Union’s Facebook group.

We all have an important part to play in 
sustainability
I’d like to thank Chris Marth for the Fri-
day letter highlighting a topic important 
to campus sustainability that both staff 
and students play a part in improving.
Almost 100 percent of UF’s irrigation 
water is reclaimed from our on-campus 
wastewater treatment facility. The re-
quirement to water landscapes before 10 
a.m. and after 4 p.m.and only twice a week applies to potable water resources.
Our storage capacity for treated wa-
ter at UF is surpassed by our generation 
of water that needs to be treated. It’s an 
unfortunate reality that we can and some-times need to irrigate at all times of the 
day and night to distribute the reclaimed 
water.
Much of the sustainability concern is on 
the front end of this equation. Our labo-ratories and building users do not always treat water as a precious commodity.
The Office of Sustainability, Physical 
Plant Division and Environmental Health and Safety staff are trying to work with laboratory users and building managers 
on campus to install water-saving devices 
and implement behaviors that save wa-ter, but there isn’t a financial incentive to spend funds on water conservation mea-sures that can make things difficult.One example of an effort being made 
for water conservation at UF is the pro-
gram designed by the department of hous-
ing. The water conservation campaign helps students understand the importance of conserving water, while providing them unique tools and resources like shower 
timers to help make it an engaging learn-
ing process.
Concerning Marth’s specific comments 
about sprinklers spraying sidewalks rather 
than grass, the best way to resolve this or 
any problem with campus infrastructure is to call the Physical Plant Division to report the problem. If you spot an irrigation-re-lated problem or notice sprinkler systems 
running for an excessive amount of time, 
please contact it at 352-392-1121.
We all have an important part to play 
in helping our university and campus be-
come more sustainable.

Gator Nation glory days long gone
As if three losses and a baffling offen-
sive scheme weren’t enough, the Gators 
football team managed to bump itself off 
the road to the Southeastern Conference 
championship Saturday, losing against the South Carolina Gamecocks 36 to 14.
The Gamecocks, for the first time in his-
tory, defeated the Gators in The Swamp and crushed any hopes of a Gator SEC championship title.
A failure to plan is a plan to fail but ap-
parently, Steve Addazio, UF offensive co-
ordinator, didn’t get the memo.
The new offensive scheme, led with 
a quarterback and two pseudo-quarter -
backs, proved to be a massive failure and 
left Gator fans wondering, “Who is our quarterback, and what are they doing?”
Apparently, variety is not a big enough 
factor to win football games. Neither is a fiery start. Andre Debose, a redshirt fresh-
man wide receiver, returned the opening 
kickoff for a touchdown, but what hap-pened next surprised everyone.
Ahmad Black and cornerback Janoris 
Jenkins picked up most of the slack for the defense in the second half of the game, but they alone were not enough to make a game-changing impact for the already struggling Gators on their way to failure.
What is obvious is that something needs 
to change.
The Gators need to use our offensive 
weapons more effectively and stop relying on a quarterback-running back scheme be-cause we clearly don’t have it down.
The days of the Tebow-Harvin power -
house are long gone, and the earlier the 
coaches and coordinators accept it, the 
better. 
Use the advantages of the wide receiv-
ers’ and running backs’ speed and pair it 
with the versatility and size of the tight 
ends and we could be unstoppable. 
Gators, we have to do better.Embracing the new shape of the Gator 
offense and finding a way to use the re-
cruiting class effectively are the next chal-
lenges for the team to overcome.
Of course, SEC title hopes are a thing 
of the past, but we can improve from here 
and regain some of that lost dignity, pride 
and respect for Gator Nation football.

Gator Nation has fickle fans
Dear Gator Nation,You are some of the worst fans on the 
planet. Whenever your team is winning 
you cheer your hearts out, but when we’re 
not doing so well you don’t cheer. When the team makes plays you don’t agree with you actually start to jeer the team. 
Do you seriously think that’s going to 
make them play better? A good number of people also left before the end of the third quarter. 
We still could have caught up at that 
time. Some of you don’t live up to the 
words, “In all kinds of weather we all stick 
together for F-L-O-R-I-D-A.” You should be ashamed you only support your team when we’re winning and not at all times. The Gators are not invincible, like every other team. 
We had bad times in the past and will 
have bad times again. I know I will still cheer no matter how our team is doing. And to everyone who stayed the whole game and cheered no matter how down 
we were, I thank you whole-heartedly. Go 
Gators!

Participants in this year’s event brought in about $65,000
“You never think this is going to 
happen to you,” she said. “I did ev-erything by the book and still ended up with a premature baby.”
According to March of Dimes 
statistics, one out of eight babies is 
born preterm. Gators March for Ba-bies was created so college students, teachers and alumni could get in-volved with a growing epidemic.
The event was a 5k walk/run 
through the UF campus with “spirit 
stations” along the way with give-
aways and free cupcakes, popcorn and brownies. Participants who made it to the end walked under an arch of purple and white balloons, greeted by the UF band, Dazzlers and the UF gymnastics team.
Betsy Trent, executive director 
of March of Dimes in North Central 
Florida, said this year brought in 
about $65,000 to fund various pro-grams and grants, like smoking ces-sation for mothers and support for families with prematurity issues.
She said brain development 
is crucial in the last few weeks of pregnancy , and mothers should try to go full term if possible. A re-
cent study funded by the March of 
Dimes found that some mothers and doctors choose to induce labor and have Caesarean sections out of con-venience and not of necessity.
Cecelia Ribuffo knows love and 
loss all too well. She always wanted a baby girl. When she was little, she would cradle her favorite doll and imagine what it would be like to 
hold her own child in her arms.
In college, she got pregnant and 
thought she finally had everything 
she wanted. It wasn’t so. Early pregnancy was marred by constant 
cramping. And she wasn’t gain-
ing weight. She knew something 
was wrong. At 
first, the doc-tors said she was “anxious.”
Ribuffo, in 
constant pain, felt 
like her baby was having seizures in-side of her. When they cut Annabelle out she weighed only 2 pounds.
“I felt so sorry for her. You ex-
pect your little Gerber baby ,” she said. “Instead you have a child that’s holding on for dear life.”
The situation wasn’t ideal, but 
the Ribuffos were a family. How-ever, before the shutter clicked for a family photo by the incubator, the doctor walked in with bad news. 
Annabelle’s brain was bleeding. Doctors tried an experimental procedure that involved burning a hole into her brain. It didn’t work. They tried a brain shunt to de-
crease swelling. Through the ordeal, 
Ribuffo tried toput on a brave face, but she was tortured.
Finally , Annabelle stabilized and 
the Ribuffos could breathe. They registered at Babies”R”Us and took a trip to Walt Disney World. When they got back, they were on a high, only to be greeted by bad news.  An-
nabelle was fussy and didn’t want 
to be held. Her head started grow-ing again. She had hydrocephalus, a buildup of spinal fluid in the brain. It can be deadly, moreso for infants. 
An MRI of Annabelle’s brain 
showed that there was barely any fluid left. It was all black with a thin layer of red. She was brain dead.  
Annabelle would never know who she was, she’d never know her parents, she’d never know Santa Claus. After all the fighting and fear, all the surgeries and pain, all the hope you could squeeze out of a human being, it was over.  
Even though she suffered an un-speakable loss, Ribuffo wants others 
to know this could happen to them. 
And even though she probably can’t carry another baby, her sister-in-law offered to be a surrogate mother. 
They started the process last 
week.

Wagner: UPD is focusing less on ticketing, more on preventing rule-breaking
have to make yourself big, basically make 
yourself a car,” he said.
An example of such a situation would be 
when a biker intends to make a left turn. In those instances, a cyclist should enter into the left vehicle lane and use the appropriate hand signals.
Wagner said that in addition to forgetting 
to use these signals, many cyclists fail to stop at red lights.
Another concern that has raised safety 
issues involves headsets. Florida law says people can’t operate a vehicle — including a bicycle — while wearing a headset, head-phone or any other listening device besides a hearing aid, according to Florida Bicycle Laws.
Bike riders also commonly disregard the 
ordinance that requires them to ride with lights at night. Wagner said this requirement 
is not only to help riders see while riding, but 
also to make cyclists more visible to other ve-
hicles.
Harcha understands how important it 
is for bikers to practice “defensive riding.” 
Crowded bike lanes raise a need for bikers to be aware of other riders.
Harcha said bikers also have to be aware 
of cars. 
“You gotta watch out for cars because cars 
won’t watch out for you,” he said.
Harcha experienced this firsthand when 
he was in a bike accident during the 2009 spring semester. A driver didn’t see him as 
he was crossing Gale Lemerand Drive and 
hit his front tire, sending him flying through 
the air.
Harcha, who woke up in the hospital with 
a  fractured left temporal bone and wrist, said he was not wearing a helmet. After the acci-dent, he said he became much more serious 
about bicycle safety, specifically helmet use. 
He now considers wearing a helmet “the 
most important thing you can do” while rid-
ing a bike.
Wagner said a high percentage of bike ac-
cident injuries are head injuries. 
Harcha learned this the hard way.
“If you fall over, your head 
is the farthest thing from the 
ground,” he said.
Sara Drumm, a sophomore 
journalism major at UF, said she sees bicycle 
accidents on campus all the time. After de-
ciding she didn’t feel safe riding on campus 
last year, she left her bike on campus hoping 
that it would be picked up by UPD at the end 
of the year.
“Watching the bikers on campus makes 
me feel like I would probably crash into someone and die,” she said.Wagner said UPD is focusing less on tick-
eting students who are breaking rules and more on preventing the rules from being 
broken in the first place.
UPD gives presentations at Freshman 
Preview Orientation weekends as well as at 
the meetings of different campus organiza-tions. These presentations highlight the im-
portance of bicycle safety to student cyclists 
and remind them of the laws.
The presentations are also meant to in-
form students of the potential dangers in-volved with riding bicycles. 
There’s a gray area, however. Bikers are 
allowed in some areas that cars are not, and 
many of these areas are on campus.
Adam Butler, a junior at UF, said that a 
lot of bike safety should be second nature for 
riders.
“You need to use common sense and not 
run over people,” he said.BIKE , from page 1AROUND GAINESVILLE

Gainesville middle school students, some 
of whom have never been outside of central 
Florida, are making connections across the 
world. 
Three middle schools in Gainesville are 
part of a pen pal program, allowing stu-dents to communicate with other students their own age in South Africa. 
It started with Science Partners in Inqui-
ry-based Collaborative Education, a project funded by the National Science Foundation for UF graduate students of various studies. 
SPICE, which pairs a graduate student with a participating teacher at one of six Alachua 
County schools, aims to create hands-on, 
inquiry-based lessons or activities for stu-dents to teach ecosystem health. 
The NSF awarded SPICE with a one-
time grant to travel to South Africa for re-search purposes and to visit South African 
schools. 
But a three-week trip in the summer of 
2009 was not enough for Darina Palacio.
“We wanted to give back and continue 
the relationship,” said Palacio, a second-year environmental engineering graduate 
student.
Palacio, who does her SPICE activities at 
Howard W. Bishop Middle School, spear -
headed the pen pal project. 
About 100 students there, along with 
about 100 at Lincoln Middle School and 100 at A.L. Mebane Middle School, wrote letters to 130 students in South Africa at Mandeni 
Primary School in February, Palacio said.South African students responded to the 
letters in June, according to May Steward, 
a seventh-grade teacher at Lincoln Middle 
School. The last scheduled delivery of the 
international letters was Friday to Stew-
ard’s students. 
 Steward, who has been working with 
UF’s SPICE for six years, said the pen pal 
project has changed her students’ perspec-tives of the world. 
“They see that the kids aren’t that differ -ent from them,” Steward said.
The letters, delivered in giant pink and 
orange envelopes, were decorated with col-orful notes, pictures, drawings and maga-
zine cutouts. Messages read, “I love you,” 
“friends forever” and “God may bless you,” 
along with facts about each student’s life.
Palacio said SPICE also held a school 
supplies drive from January to February and sent two large suitcases full of supplies 
to Mandeni. 
Mandeni was able to start new art class-
es because of the supply delivery. 
SPICE will not continue to coordinate 
letter deliveries, but students are highly en-
couraged to keep contact. 
“They’re learning things they never 
thought they would,” Steward said of her students. “They are ecstatic.”Middle schoolers write to South African pen pals

alligatorSports.org GATORS IN THE NFL TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT DUKE BEAT UF 4-2.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
It was a game of déjà vu. For the 
second time this season, Florida 
and Duke played for 120 minutes. 
And both times the two teams left everything out on the field.
But Sunday afternoon, Becky 
Burleigh’s Gators ran out of gas 
when the clock wasn’t even tick-
ing. 
No. 5 Florida, a No. 2 seed in 
the NCAA Tournament, lost to the 
Blue Devils in a penalty shootout, 
leaving a sad taste in many Gators’ mouths. 
“Obviously that was a disap-
pointing finish to a great season,” 
Burleigh said. “I hand it to Duke. 
They defended hard. I thought that they played really hard.”
In a physical battle that pitted 
the two familiar opponents, Duke was able to outlast Florida by scor -
ing all four of its penalty kick op-portunities. After a scoreless two 
halves and two overtimes, a terrific 
season that included sweeping the Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships was down to who could 
kick the ball the best from 12 yards away. 
“We had to be at the top of our 
game,” Duke coach Robbie Church said. “We got by by the slimmest of margins. It’s a tough way to win and a tough way to lose.”
The game was controlled by a 
constant ebb and flow. Both teams defended relentlessly, and at times the referee seemed to lose control. 
There were a combined 27 fouls 
in the game, but one that wasn’t called was perhaps the play of the game. 
With less than a minute to go 
in the second overtime, SEC Tour -
nament MVP Erika Tymrak pos-sessed the ball at the top of Duke’s box. Quickly changing direction to 
get the ball back on her right foot, 
Tymrak was body-checked by a Blue Devils defender. But there was no call. 
In a game in which the referee 
kept the whistle close, a packed James G. Pressly Stadium went nuts when he decided not to make 
the call. 
However, the officials did not 
decide the game, as Florida failed 
to mount constant pressure on the 
Duke defense. 
“We were not able to break 
them down enough to get good op-
portunities,” Burleigh said. “It just seemed like we were just a little bit out of sync in terms of our passing 
and connecting with each other.”

urged fans to come out in full force 
and dress like smurfs on Saturday, 
now it’s time that you demand something from them: some good football.
But that request could go unful-

Marcus Lattimore was stood up, forward 
progress halted, on the Florida 5-yard line. 
Then, his linemen ran up behind him 
and pushed him into the end zone for his 
third score of the game — the cherry on top of South Carolina’s 36-14 victory. 
It was the perfect end to the night — even 
when UF stopped Lattimore, it couldn’t re-ally stop Lattimore. 
South Carolina’s freshman workhorse 
rushed 40 times for 212 yards and three 
scores, all career highs. 
It was the third time this season Lat-
timore went over 180 yards (Georgia and 
Tennessee) and the second time he went 
over 35 carries (Georgia).
“We needed to have great run defense, and we didn’t,” defensive coordinator Ter -
yl Austin said.
UF’s front seven couldn’t contain USC’s 
powerful ground game from start to finish, 
as Lattimore ran to build a lead and then 
maintain it. 
Kentucky’s Derrick Locke held the pre-
vious high rushing total 
against UF’s defense this 
season, going for 103 on the ground in a 48-14 blowout loss. 
The 6-foot, 218-pound 
back ran for 83 yards in the 
first half Saturday, break-
ing tackles and dragging defenders for extra yards. 
Lattimore’s physical running style was too 
much for the Gators’ defense.

Becky Burleigh
UF soccer coach Not the early game plan of giving Chris 
Rainey the ball. Seven of the ﬁ  rst 10 plays 
went to Rainey, and he ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst 
half with 13 yards.
  Florida was outgained 347 yards to 67 
through three quarters and allowed South 
Carolina to hold possession for a whop-ping 40 minutes out of 60.
  Afterward, Meyer was lost for words to 
point out the problems.
  “If I had an answer for that, we wouldn’t 
have struggled,” he said.
  The lone bright spot was Andre De-
bose’s 99-yard touchdown return on the opening kickoff, but that wound up as more karma than a game-changer.   Debose sent the stadium into a frenzy, 
but the Gamecocks rattled off 29 unan-swered points to suck the drama out of the game — a scene reminiscent of Florida’s 2006 BCS Championship win, when Ohio State lost 41-14 after returning the open-
ing kick for a score.
  South Carolina leaned hard on fresh-
man running back Marcus Lattimore, who 
turned 40 carries into 212 yards and three 
touchdowns. His last score twisted the 
knife in the Gators’ back, when he was stood up at the 5-yard line and pounded his way into the end zone with the help of his teammates to set the ﬁ  nal margin.
  “Basically, they did whatever they 
wanted whenever they wanted,” Black said.
  Gamecocks quarterback Stephen Garcia 
was an efﬁ  cient 15 of 22 for 156 yards and added a rushing touchdown. It wasn’t a star performance, but he outplayed Brant-ley by far.
  Brantley entered the fourth quarter 8 of 
16 with 46 yards and an interception, and the low point came in the third, when his pass was batted into the air and he caught it from his back for a loss of 10 yards.
  Fans booed both the play-calling and 
Brantley’s performance, and cheers rained down when Jordan Reed was subbed in for a few plays.
  Reed wasn’t ﬂ  ashy either, with 12 yards 
rushing and 46 passing, but he did throw a touchdown to Rainey, who took a pass in the ﬂ  at and dashed down the sideline for a score.
  The loss highlighted a lot of problem 
areas for the Gators to address, but Meyer said benching Brantley isn’t an option.
  “Jordan’s not functional at everything 
yet as a quarterback,” Meyer said. “We 
were going to be in the throwing game 
trying to come back, and we were going to try and win that game.” MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 15

Black Urban Meyer said he wanted 
the atmosphere on Saturday 
to be insane. And, 14 seconds 
into the game, Debose sparked the crowd with a 99-yard kickoff return, making him the ﬁ  rst player 
in school history to house two 
kicks in one season. His score also marked the ﬁ  rst time since 
1997 that a UF player brought an 
opening kickoff to the end zone. But, unfortunately for UF, it was one of the only bright moments. South Carolina’s lack of a passing attack was more a result of Steve Spurrier 
not trusting his quarterback 
than UF’s coverage. Still, the 5-foot-11 Jenkins made some 
good plays to limit Gamecocks 
receiver Alshon Jeffery, who stands ﬁ  ve inches taller. Jeffery averaged about 115 yards per 
game before Saturday but was 
limited to 53 against Jenkins and Co. SWAMP STUDS

Florida’s second-leading tackler,

the NFL after this season. 
That team had Percy Harvin. 
This one has … Deonte Thomp-son?
  The future of Florida football 
is not as bright as it is made out 
to be. 
Unless the Gators manage 
a miracle-like breakthrough in the last three games of the year, 
they will enter next season with more question marks than an-
swers.
  The quarterback position 
that has accumulated 10 touch-
downs and nine interceptions this season looks to have no so-
lution in sight.
  Brantley will likely be the 
team’s quarterback next season 
only because of a lack of depth at the position. 
He has yet to prove anything 
in his ﬁ  rst season at the helm. 
Although, that was a hell of a 
one-handed catch he made on his back against South Caro-lina. 
  And who will ﬁ  ll in for a de-
pleted Gators defense? 
  UF will lose senior defensive 
tackles Lawrence Marsh, Bran-don Antwine and Terron Sand-
ers, and this season’s starting 
defensive ends, Justin Trattou and Duke Lemmens.
  Safety Ahmad Black, the best 
player on the team, in my opin-ion, is the only member of Flor-ida’s secondary who is guar-anteed to be gone. But Jenkins 
could leave early for the NFL.
  Starting outside linebackers 
A.J. Jones and Brandon Hicks 
are also playing in their last sea-
son as Gators.
  Those are eight contributors 
on the UF defense deﬁ  nitely 
leaving, maybe nine if Jenkins decides to forgo his senior sea-
son.
  And on offense, the Gators 
will lose four of their starting 
offensive linemen. 
But the real problem is that 
all of the “skill players” are re-turning except for running back Emmanuel Moody. 
The unit will feature most of 
the same receivers and backs who have contributed to this season’s stagnant offense.
It doesn’t help that next 
year’s schedule features SEC West matchups against Ala-bama and Auburn, and road 
games against LSU and South 
Carolina.
  So blame the coaches, play-
ers, refs, or whoever else you can ﬁ  nd to use as a scapegoat.
  But the truth is that the 
Gators have begun a new chap-ter of football called the rebuild-ing era. ANTHONY , from page 14
tackles and a good job getting north and 
south,” Austin said. “We didn’t do a good job tackling.”
  Austin said his team did a great job 
getting off the ﬁ  eld last week against Vanderbilt, when the Gators allowed the Commodores to convert only twice in 16 
opportunities on third down.
  Behind Lattimore, the Gamecocks con-
verted eight of 16 attempts on third down 
and dominated time of possession 40:46 to 19:14. 
  UF coach Urban Meyer didn’t put all 
of Lattimore’s success on his defense, say-ing the time of possession was too much to overcome. 
  “We have to help those guys out,” Mey-
er said of his offense. 
  In addition to South Carolina control-
ling the clock with its run game, Florida’s  offense couldn’t stay on the ﬁ  eld and sus-tain a drive to give the defense a much-needed break. 
  The Gators went three-and-out on four 
of their ﬁ  rst six drives and didn’t have a drive of more than ﬁ  ve plays until the fourth quarter. UF entered the third quarter with 67 to-
tal yards and three ﬁ  rst downs. 
Those offensive statistics, paired with 
Florida’s up-tempo offense, allowed South Carolina to control the ball for most of the game.

UF BASKETBALL

The Gators may not have opened the 
game the way they wanted to, but it’s hard 
to argue with the end result.
No. 9 Florida overcame a slow start to 
win its 20th consecutive season opener as it defeated UNC-Wilmington 77-60 on Friday in the O’Connell Center.
The Gators trailed 11-6 after 4:55 but used 
balanced scoring, strong rebounding and a powerful press to make a 15-4 run en route 
to the victory.
Each of the five starters scored at least 
nine points, while sophomore Erik Murphy 
chipped in 10 of his own off the bench.
“We had really good balance,” said senior 
Chandler Parsons, who led the way with 16 
points. “That’s going to be our whole thing 
this year. We play unselfish and make the extra pass.”
The Gators had plenty of chances to score, 
as they cashed in on 52 percent of their of-fensive rebounding opportunities.
Senior Alex Tyus led the way on the 
glass, grabbing four of the team’s 17 offen-sive boards and finishing with a team-high seven rebounds.
“That was one of our tone points last 
year, and we wanted to start it off strong this year,” Tyus said. “That’s something that we can control, just trying to kill the other team on the offensive glass.”
A third point that helped Florida to vic-
tory was a potent press defense led by fresh-man Scottie Wilbekin, who recorded four steals in 17 minutes.
Wilbekin rotated with Parsons, sopho-
more Kenny Boynton and junior Erving Walker at the guard spots, allowing the Gators to wear down a shallow Seahawks backcourt.UF’s 12 steals were a refreshing change 
from the second half of the team’s final ex-hibition game, when coach Billy Donovan noticed a lack of intensity.
“Coach got onto us this week in practice 
about the press,” Wilbekin said. “We were all trying to get out there and work hard 
in the press and frustrate them.”
While the Gators suc-
cessfully forced 20 turn-overs, they also recorded 15 of their own.
Florida was often guilty 
of attempting ill-advised home-run passes, and its guards occasionally tried 
to push the ball up the floor too quickly.
“I think we rushed a little bit offensively 
in the first half, certainly the first 10 min-utes,” Donovan said.
Another area in which the Gators contin-ued to struggle was 3-point shooting, as the team shot just 6 of 19 in the game.
Boynton cooled down significantly after 
shooting 8 of 15 from beyond the arc in the exhibition season, going 0 for 6 from down-town against UNCW.
Walker, on the other hand, rebounded 
from a preseason in which he shot just 1 of 10 from distance by opening the year with a 3-for-5 performance.
Despite his players’ streaky shooting, 
Donovan hasn’t asked them to limit their at-tempts. 
“We haven’t been a prolific scoring team 
and a knock-down jump-shooting team, but I try to give them freedom because I do think when you do that they can have a game where they make 12, 13, 14 threes,” Donovan said. “We can’t let a lack of knocking down 3-point shots discourage us as a team.”
The Gators will host No. 4 Ohio State on 
Tuesday.
Gators open season with win against UNC-Wilmington
By MATT WATTS

All offseason, the coaches and 
players have talked about bring-
ing a new brand of Gators basket-ball to Gainesville.
That new look was visible at 
times in Saturday’s 77-67 vic-tory over visiting UCF in the first 
round of the Preseason Women’s 
NIT.
After falling behind 9-1 to start 
the game, the Gators used an at-tacking defense to take control. On a night when the team tied the school record for blocks with 14, it was the defense that set the tone and helped the Gators recover from 16 first-half turnovers.
“The good thing about having a 
lot of turnovers and still being able 
to have a win is that they’re cor -
rectable, they’re in your control,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “A lot 
of our turnovers were things we did to ourselves. When you’re in charge of your own mistakes, you have a better chance at correcting them.”
The Gators did just that. Fans 
began to see the up-tempo style Butler wants to use during a 16-3 run in the final 5:14 of the first half, helping Florida build a 10-point lead.
UF came out of halftime much 
the same, extending its lead to 22 points.
“When we ran away from them 
… that was the tempo we needed, defensively and offensively,” But-ler said. 
Much of the spark came from 
the guard duo of Jaterra Bonds 
and Lanita Bar -
tley. 
Bonds came 
off the bench to lead the Gators 
with 15 points 
on 4-of-7 shoot-ing in a team-
high 29 minutes of action. Bartley used her aggressive play to grab four steals and lead the Gators on multiple fast-break scoring oppor -
tunities. 
The two brought the same in-tensity to the offensive end, driv-
ing to the basket and forcing UCF 
to defend in the paint as well as outside. 
“I just use my quickness and do 
what I do,” Bartley said of her four steals. “I wanted to set the tempo and get my team involved and just run. That’s what we do best.” 
She finished with 12 points and 
four rebounds in a nearly mistake-free 18 minutes. 
Guard Kayla Lewis became 
the first true freshman to start a home opener since 2002, and she didn’t disappoint. Lewis stuffed the stat sheet with nine points, six rebounds, three blocks, two assists and a steal. 
Despite going up by 22, the 
Gators’ lead shriveled to just five with 2:25 left in the game, but the 
players said they weren’t wor -
ried.
“We needed to step our tempo 
up,” Bonds said. “There was no 
way that lead should have got cut down to five points.”
Two clutch free throws and one 
of a team-high four blocks from center Azania Stewart sparked the Gators and extended the lead back to nine points with more than a 
minute to play. 
“With all the hard work we 
have put in since June, it was time 
to go out there and have some fun,” Lewis said.
With the win, UF advances to 
the second round of the NIT and will take on Charlotte tonight at 7 
in the O’Connell Center.
