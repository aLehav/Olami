IT IS “BE THE TRADITION. ”
By Jordan McPherson
Alligator Staff Writer
jmcpherson@alligator.org
 Each generation of UF students sets 
its own traditions, and they will all come 
together during the 2015 homecoming celebration. 
This year’s theme is “Be The Tradi-
tion,” the UF Homecoming and Gator Growl organization announced Monday.
Maddie Daugherty, a Gator Growl producer, said there were about 100 submissions in its “You Choose” con-test, which allowed students to suggest this year’s theme, adding that a lot of the submissions played off the word “tradi-tion.”
“Once we kind of looked at them 
collectively, it was just something that came together based on all of the ideas,” 
the 21-year old said.
Santiago Ramirez, the associate pro-
ducer of communications for Homecom-
ing and Gator Growl, said the theme is one that both UF students and alumni can relate to.
“It’s not just one tradition,” Ramirez 
said, “but it’s what the students do dur-ing that time, and what they leave be-hind and how they leave their mark at the university.”
Following last year’s Gator Growl, 
which was held on UF’s Flavet Field in-
stead of the football stadium for the ﬁ  rst 
time in 82 years, Ramirez said the com-mittee put out a student survey and re-Gator Growl theme announced

The chant “Black lives matter, Black lives matter” 
ﬁ  lled the air in the Civic Media Center on Monday. 
The power of the chant silenced the room.The center presented “Riot or Uprising?” a presen-
tation which looked at the biased reporting of racial 
riots throughout history.
The evening provided the audience with informa-
tion about the long history of biased media coverage 
on riots.
“Media has characterized protesters as thugs,” 
said Kenzie Cooke, one of the organizers of the event. “The protesters are criminalized while the me-dia fails to focus on racist police forces.”
The audience was shown race riots that happened 
throughout history. 
The riots were viewed as the spark to riots that 
are occurring today, such as the riots currently going 
on in Baltimore.
Nailah Summers, the other organizer of the event, 
argued that nobody talks about the violence imposed on the protesters by police forces.
With events such as the Trayvon Martin case in 
Central Florida case and the Freddie Gray case in 
Baltimore, the event magniﬁ  ed the harshness of the American media and its portrayal of black protesters. 
A news reporter was shown in a video calling the 
protesters in Baltimore “thugs and looters” and said that it was appropriate for her to refer to them as that because President Barack Obama did. The audience 
was asked to dig deeper into the riots of the past to 
realize that these protests did not come out of the blue. 
“I’m glad that there’s a vested interest of the black 
community,” Summers said at the end of the night. “We had a full house. It’s encouraging and hearten-ing.”    Talk sheds light 
on riot coverage in media

Teresa Turner said she remembers 
watching the donations arrive faster than 
she could count them.
Turner, the director of student affairs 
at the Southern Scholarship Foundation in Gainesville, has worked for the scholarship fund for 19 years. 
She’s seen underprivileged kids from 
across Florida go to college because of the foundation’s scholarship funds.
This year, they added 20 scholarships, 
Turner said. 
In order to continue growing, Turner said the foundation started asking for do-
nations in January. The initial goal was to 
raise $60,000 this year.When the Southern Scholarship Foun-
dation’s 60th anniversary passed April 13, foundation President Mickey S. Moore in-creased the fundraising goal to $150,000.
The foundation doesn’t want to just stay 
aﬂ  oat, Turner said. It wants to improve on what it built.
Moore said the additional $90,000 would 
help renovate the 27 scholarship houses

Two found dead at New College 
over weekend
SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) — Authorities are investigating pos-sible drug involvement in two weekend deaths at New College, Florida’s elite public liberal arts school. Sarasota police report that officers found 21-year-old Dylan Besser, a University of Central Florida student from Boca Raton, 
unresponsive in a residence hall 
early Friday morning after a stu-dent called the police. On Sunday afternoon, authorities found 18-year-old Julian Toomsen-Hall, a New College freshman from Georgia, unresponsive in a differ-ent residence hall.Investigators say the deaths could be drug-related, but they’ll have to wait for toxicology tests to con-firm it, which could take months.
Lawsuit filed in Florida police 
killing of man with air gunFORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A federal lawsuit has been filed over the 2013 fatal shoot-ing by a Broward County sheriff’s deputy of a man carrying what turned out to be an air rifle.The lawsuit seeking unspecified damages was filed Monday on behalf of the estate of Jermaine McBean against the county, Sheriff Scott Israel and Deputy Peter Peraza. McBean was shot 
July 31, 2013, by Peraza outside 
his apartment complex while car-
rying the unloaded Winchester air rifle. The lawsuit says the 33-year-old McBean threatened 
no one and could not hear depu-
ties’ commands to drop the gun 
because he was listening to music with earbuds.No charges have been brought 
against Peraza, a 12-year veteran 
at the time of the shooting. The 
sheriff’s office declined comment Monday on the lawsuit.
Olive Garden’s latest plan: 
Breadstick sandwiches
NEW YORK (AP) — Olive 
Garden’s plan to win back cus-tomers? Take the breadsticks it’s known for and make sandwiches 
out of them.
The restaurant chain owned by 
Darden Restaurants Inc. said it plans to use its breadsticks for chicken parmigiana and meatball sandwiches starting June 1.The addition of the breadstick sandwiches is the latest attempt to revamp Olive Garden’s menu and marketing after sales at estab-lished locations have declined for the past three of its fiscal years. Justin Sikora, a Darden represen-tative, said the breadsticks used for the sandwiches will be a bit shorter and wider than the regu-
lar breadsticks.
As with all other dishes, the com-
pany says the sandwiches come with unlimited breadsticks.The sandwiches will be available 
only on the chain’s lunch menu. 
The meatball sandwich will cost 
$6.99 and the chicken parmigiana will cost $7.99, Sikora said.

Florida State Rep. Keith Perry gives the commencement speech in front of about 120 graduates at the 
commencement ceremony for Saint Leo University’s Gainesville Education Center on Saturday at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. In his speech, Perry told students to strive to be the best at what-ever they do. “Excellence is not an act, ” Perry said, “but a habit. ”
It is still going to be 
held at Flavet Field
ida lived in during the 2014-2015 
academic year. 
An increasing amount of the 
foundation’s houses have been deteriorating in recent years, Turner said. 
“The balance will be to repair 
much-needed housing,” Turner said. “A lot of our houses, espe-cially in Tallahassee, are pretty old.”
Turner said when the homes 
were first built, they didn’t come with a maintenance clause. 
That oversight to not add 
a maintenance clause into the 
housing contract has cost the 
foundation thousands of dollars in repairs, she said.
Turner grew up in Gainesville, 
and she was eager to move back to her hometown with her hus-band and daughter.
“When they first called me 
and asked me if I wanted to go, I was jumping for any excuse al-ready,” Turner said. “We love it here.”
The foundation currently 
helps a number of students in Gainesville pay for college. 
One of those students is Joey 
Briggs, a junior studying at UF. 
Briggs receives funds from the 
foundation and he lives in one of its nine houses in Gainesville.
“I wouldn’t have been able to 
go to college probably, at least not UF,” Briggs said. Briggs has kept up with all of 
the Southern Scholarship Foun-dation’s requirements, which re-quires students to maintain a 3.0 GPA and participate in extracur-ricular activities.
“We have plenty of students 
from all over that need our help, especially at UF, and unfortu-nately the houses aren’t the best 
right now,” Turner said.
Turner said the foundation 
is planning fundraising events 
in May and June. She said she hopes one of them is an online 
auction.
“We haven’t finalized any-
thing,” Turner said, “but right 
now we are just planning what to do next.”
SCHOLARSHIP,  from pg 1It had 458 recipients in 2014-2015
ceived generally positive feedback.
Evan Morris, a junior at UF, has 
gone to Gator Growl for the past 
three years and said last year’s Gator Growl on Flavet Field was 
the most enjoyable of the three. 
The 21-year-old marketing ma-
jor said while he understands some 
students did not like the change of venue because of the long-standing tradition of holding Gator Growl in the football stadium, he liked the atmosphere at Flavet Field.
“It gave it that kind of music-
festival feel,” Morris said. 
To Morris, the theme “Be the 
Tradition” gives current students an opportunity to show that they are making an imprint on UF.
“It’s kind of taking the great his-
tory of being a Gator and going to UF and all the rituals behind that and making it our own,” he said.
Now that the committee has 
agreed on a theme, which Ramirez said gives the committee guide-lines to follow, it can start figuring out who will be performing at the event.
Ramirez said talent will be se-
lected by the end of Summer B, but the 21-year-old political science and public relations junior said there is still going to be student input.
“It’s not just a decision that the 
producer or myself or anyone on Gator Growl staff makes just on their own,” he said.GROWL,  from pg 1RTS summer 2015 scheduleTUESDAY, MAY 12, 2015   ALLIGATOR   5

Nice to see you again.
Welcome back to Gainesville, everybody. Wasn’t 
that a nice little break we had? We hope you spent 
it doing the nicest things imaginable. Whether it 
was visiting family, reuniting with friends, floating 
down a river with a cool drink in your hand or getting eight hours of sleep for once, we hope it was every bit of the 
relaxation-fun-fulfillment you deserve.  
But now that we’re back in Gainesville and at UF, life is 
about to get ... different. Because this is a “welcome back” 
editorial, we’ll do our best to focus on the sunnier side of Summer sessions: not classes, papers, the fact that it rains 
nearly every afternoon and the sweat. Oh, mercy, the sweat.
We’d rather pay attention to what makes summertime 
Gainesville a great place to be and leave out the obvious 
detractions. It’s actually something to get excited for. In its 
own way, summer is a magical time. It means leaving be-
hind what for most of us is a dreary heat-soaked hometown for this weird little bubble of culture, intellect and youthful hedonism we’ve all come to love so much.
That’s another nice part: It’s not like you’re alone here. 
UF’s usual population dwindles in the Summer semesters, 
but there remains a ton of people to meet and have fun with. 
The city isn’t so swelled up with people, so it’s a bit more relaxed and you won’t have to wait in line anywhere. Fresh-men, this means you’ll be able to find your way around and 
know what’s what before things get truly hectic.
As for school being something to dread and groan at: 
Yeah, working sucks. Obviously, we’d all rather just watch 
shows and live in bed. But that doesn’t line up with reality, y’all. Life isn’t a float down on Ginnie Springs (side note: 
anyone who knows how to make life that easy is requested 
to contact the Alligator editorial staff immediately). We are students, after all, so whether you genuinely like learning or if you just want to get ahead and graduate a little earlier, 
being in school is the best thing you could be doing for 
yourself at the moment. You can complain, but that won’t fool anyone.
So that’s how it is. It may suck a bit to give up some 
of those glorious days off, but in the long run, we’ll all be 
better for it. Yes, this is the semester when UF’s decision to 
exist on top of a literal swamp seems the most outrageous. And yeah, we could easily choose to view Summer sessions as one long, sweaty trudge through Turlington, where the 
rain itself is somehow also hot.
But who would want to do that?Welcome home, 
Gators. Summer is 
upon us
While competition benefits democracy, GOP’s 
endless number of candidates creates problems
November 2016 is more than a year 
away, but the Republican Party is al-ready making the same fatal mistake 
it did in 2012. 
The Grand Old Party’s search for its 
presidential candidate is like a clown car. Just when you think all the candidates have an-
nounced they are running, more candidates 
come bumbling out. We are in the double dig-its of people who have officially announced their candidacy. Last week saw the entrance of three more hopefuls: Dr. Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and 
Carly Fiorina.
Sure, competition is healthy for our democracy. 
Hillary Clinton could use more, but the GOP definitely 
needs less. I say this because one can simply look at the 
weekly polls and see the weakness of the GOP. Polling 
this week may show Ted Cruz is in the lead, but last week it was Sen. Rand Paul or Marco Rubio. The party is heavily divided on which candidate should represent it.
This rise and fall of popularity in the polls is not only 
because of new candidates announcing their bids, but also because of the factions within the GOP. For the past eight years, the main goal of the Republicans was 
to be against whatever Barack Obama advocated. This 
united the party under one clear banner: defeat Obama. 
But while this united the party almost four years ago, 
there is a little problem with the logic today: Obama cannot serve a third term or even run for one.
Clinton could be the next monolithic Democrat the 
GOP could rally the constituency against, but there is not much on her record to criticize other than multiple minor scandals. 
As a result, it is clear there are different 
kinds of Republican candidates in this race. There are evangelical candidates, such as Mike Huckabee. There are also those that come from the more business- and job-orient-
ed side of the party, like Fiorina. Then there is 
the more libertarian element, with Sen. Rand Paul as the main example. The final catego-
ry would be the candidates who appeal to the other groups in the party but who take a less conservative 
stance once the general-election campaigning begins. 
These would be the Jeb Bushes and Marco Rubios of the world. All of these candidates must pander to the conservative constituency in the primary season while 
trying to become a centrist during the general election.
With all of these interests at play this primary cycle, 
the GOP is essentially trying to determine which portion 
of the party will represent it. This identity crisis will most likely continue long after the election cycle. 
Although numerous choices for the political party’s 
candidate are beneficial — like I said, Clinton could use more competition — the Republicans are experiencing too much of a good thing.
The mass number of candidates will not only make 
these primary debates difficult, but they will also force Republicans to take even longer to determine their can-didate. 
Meanwhile, Clinton is already searching for her vice 
presidential candidate.

Jordan McPher-
son is a 20-year-old 
journalism junior 
and the editor-in-chief at the Alliga-

else. He’s original-
ly from West Palm Beach, Florida, but 
has lived in the met-
ro-Atlanta area for the last four years. 
Jordan has been working at the Alligator since Fall 2013 when he ﬁ  rst arrived at UF as a wide-eyed freshman. He worked in the sports section (referred to as “sprots” from there on) over the last two years, working his way to 
sports editor last year. In the little time he isn’t working 
on a story or making sure headlines ﬁ  t into ridiculously small spaces, Jordan devotes the majority of his time to 
ESPN and Netﬂ  ix. If you have any story ideas/complaints/

managing print editor and a 24-year-old journalism 
student from Miami. One time, she ate nothing but 
bananas for two days. She 
hopes to get a job that will give her ample banana money when she graduates 
in August. She loves all 
kinds of animals, plants, ﬁ  lm photography, road trips, 
coffee, forests, traveling, 
cooking, stormy weather and naps. This past summer she 
went to South Korea, Japan, 
the Philippines and Thailand on her own for almost two 
months. When she graduates she plans on driving across 
the U.S. by herself and taking a short trip to Costa Rica before trying to get a job that she loves. If she can't ﬁ  nd a job or internship after her travels, she will be begging to 
be a UF college student again come 2016. Or maybe she'll

position. Perhaps his 
greatest involvement with the newsroom 
was his stint as blog 
editor, where he could be found part-timing 
as a newsroom hobo 
constantly trying to ﬁ  nd an empty desk to 
edit blog posts. Looking to enter employment in magazine and online media features, he’s somewhat confused as to how he stumbled onto employment at a newspaper. Still, his purpose is to try to drag the website kicking and screaming into the digital 
millennium. Time will tell how successful he is, but summer 
lethargy and the latest offerings from Nintendo may stymie his efforts. You can usually ﬁ  nd him tapping away at his laptop as 
a full-time geek, binge playing video games or getting irritated 
at old software. If you want to chat or shoot angry messages at him, email him at lchan@alligator.org or tweet @chan_lars. Alec Carver is a

Early on, Alec de-
veloped an appre-ciation for reading 
things in earnest. Not coincidentally, 
he found a niche 
somewhere be-tween class clown 
and massive dork. Alec occupied this position until his 
senior year of high school, when knowing stuff became somewhat acceptable. This was the year he blossomed, culminating in an internship at the Tampa Bay Times. 
He wonders how in the world he got that position to this 
day. He came to UF in the Summer of 2013 and started writing for the Alligator opinions section early that Fall, 
and he has been writing there ever since. He remains too 
much of a dork to not study history. He enjoys television, waterskiing, burritos and drinking unsafe amounts of cof-

LAKE MARY, Fla. — George Zim-
merman, the neighborhood watch 
volunteer who has had a series of run-ins with girlfriends, his ex-wife and random strangers since killing an unarmed black teenager, narrowly missed getting shot Monday after a mysterious dispute.
The dispute this time was with the 
same man that authorities said was involved in a road-rage incident with Zimmerman last year. A bullet missed 
his head, spraying glass from the ve-
hicle’s windshield, said his attorney, Don West. He said the bullet lodged 
somewhere in the vehicle.
No charges were immediately ﬁ  led 
against either man.
Lake Mary Police Ofﬁ  cer Bianca 
Gillett said during a news confer-ence Monday that Matthew Apper-son called 911 to report the shoot-ing shortly after Zimmerman ﬂ  agged down an ofﬁ  cer to say someone had shot at him. Both Zimmerman and Apperson have yet to be interviewed formally by investigators, she said. 
   Last September, Apperson said Zim-
merman threatened to kill him, asking “Do you know who I am?” during a confrontation in their vehicles. Ap-person decided not to pursue charges, and police ofﬁ  cers were unable to move forward without a car tag iden-tiﬁ  ed or witnesses.
West said before the news con-
ference that Zimmerman thought he knew who was responsible for the shooting and is cooperating with au-thorities.
Zimmerman was acquitted in the 
2013 killing of Trayvon Martin, in a 
case that sparked protests and nation-
al debate about race relations. The Justice Department later announced it was not bringing a civil rights case against Zimmerman.
Since then, Zimmerman was 
charged with aggravated assault af-ter being accused of throwing a wine bottle at an ex-girlfriend, Brittany Brunelle. The case was dropped in January after she recanted her story and refused to cooperate.
Following another domestic 
confrontation, he was arrested on charges of aggravated assault, battery 
and criminal mischief after his then-
girlfriend said he pointed a gun at her face during an argument, smashed her coffee table and pushed her out of the house they shared. Samantha Scheibe decided not to cooperate with detec-tives, and prosecutors didn’t pursue the case. Zimmerman was accused by his estranged wife of smashing an iPad during an argument at the home they had shared. Shellie Zimmerman initially told a dispatcher her husband had a gun, though she later said he was unarmed. No charges were ﬁ  led because of a lack of evidence. The dis-
pute occurred days after Shellie Zim-
merman ﬁ  led divorce papers.

Mike White walked into the Gator 
Room at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on 
Monday morning wearing an orange and blue tie that was similar yet dif-ferent from the multitude of ties that 
former Florida coach Billy Donovan 
was typically clad in throughout his 19 seasons in Gainesville. 
That’s what UF athletics direc-
tor Jeremy Foley hopes he’s getting from White, Florida’s new head coach of the men’s basketball team – similar to Donovan, yet different.
White, 38, was introduced Mon-
day for the first time as head coach of the Gators, and aside from the given wardrobe similarities, White will attempt to carve his own path rather than follow in Donovan’s footsteps.
“It’s an absolute honor of mine 
to replace Billy Donovan, one of the best coaches in the history of this 
game,” said White, his slight south-
ern accent a far cry from Donovan’s New York drawl.  “I have tremen-dous respect and admiration for the legacy that he leaves, and it’s my charge to continue the momentum 
that he’s maintained for an amazing 
19 years.”
White, who previously coached 
at Louisiana Tech until Thursday, was born in Dunedin, a small Flor-ida town of around 35,000 people, but he said he lived there for only two weeks as an infant.
His father, Kevin White, the di-
rector of athletics at Duke University since 2008, moved the family across the country frequently as he pursued a career in coaching. 
“Two weeks old we move, and 
as I’m growing up as sort of an Army brat is the best way to describe it,” Mike said, “Hey, my dad’s an athlet-ic director.  What’s an athletic direc-tor? I finally just started telling my classmates my dad’s military.”
When Mike was 4, the family 
moved to Missouri where his father would serve as the head track and field coach at Southeast Missouri 
State University in 1981-82.
But White wanted to play bas-
ketball rather than run track, and 
he focused his talents on playing for Jesuit High School in New Orleans. 
When Ole Miss came calling 
with an athletic scholarship, White jumped at the chance to play South-eastern Conference basketball for coach Rob Evans.
White would become a part of 
multiple monumental moments as a Rebel — the team’s first NCAA tour-nament victory, a defeat of reigning 
national champion Kentucky and 
back-to-back SEC West titles — and would later become a graduate as-sistant at the university under cur-rent head coach Andy Kennedy. 
He even met his wife, Kira, an 
All-SEC volleyball player at Ole Miss, and the couple found out they had more in common than their pas-sion for SEC athletics.
“I would ask mom, where was 
I born again?  Dunedin, Florida?  Where’s Dunedin?,” White said. “I met my wife at University of Mis-sissippi, and we met there, and she was from Dunedin, Florida.  And incredible how it all works out, and she grew up here, of course.  She’s just as excited, if not more excited to 
come back home.”
It took some convincing of the 
couple’s’ five children, but the White 
family is back in Florida where they feel they belong. The hardest part, 
White said, was coaxing the little 
ones to cheer for the Gators.
“My twin boys who are 5 years 
old were sick when I told them that 
we were moving. We weren’t any longer going to be Bulldogs,” White said. “Jeremy (Foley) had left some Gator hats, and they loved the Gator hats.  They were sporting them around the house, but they didn’t like that we weren’t going to be Bulldogs.
“But when I said we were mov-
ing to Florida, they turned quickly.  
Especially when we talked about the 
beach, and we talked about grand-parents, and we talked about Mick-ey (Mouse), and they were sold. We still have to convert them, but ev-eryone in the family is excited about living in Florida without question.”
If anyone is more excited than 
the  White family about the hiring, 
it’s Foley.
Foley said that White’s name 
kept coming up in the coaching 
search, and it soon became appar-ent there was only one choice for the job. 
“We love the fact that he coached 
in this league, played in this league, love the fact that he recruited the 
state of Florida,” Foley said. “He’s 
done an unbelievable job (at) Loui-siana Tech. He’s a winner. That ex-cited us.”
After signing a six-year, $12-mil-
lion contract almost immediately af-ter Foley presented a copy to Mike and Kira, White said he in return handed Foley a packet describing his 
goals to accomplish during his first 
100 days as Florida’s head coach.
In White’s eyes, the job started 
the second he touched pen to pa-per in his Ruston, Louisiana, living room. 
“Obviously, we want to hit the 
ground running with recruiting,” White said. “I think at the University 
of Florida we can recruit nationally. 
But I also understand how important it is to recruit our state, especially a state that’s as fertile as it is.
“I’ve always enjoyed recruiting 
this state. Not only because I liked traveling to Florida, but because there are really good players here.  And we’re not going to get them all, 
but we’re going to recruit them all.”

J.C. Jackson will not be returning to the 
Florida football team.
According to a report by Scout.com’s 
Florida Gators site, "Fightin’ Gators", Jack-
son will not be permitted back onto the team because of a decision made by the University 
Athletic Association.Jackson was arrested on April 18 in 
connection with an armed robbery at a 
Gainesville apartment complex.Jackson was held in Alachua County jail 
on a $150,000 bond that was later posted.
“We are aware of the news involving J.C. 
Jackson and he is currently dealing with a serious issue,” McElwain said in a statement following Jackson's arrest. “We don’t con-done any of his actions and it is not some-
thing that reflects on the expectations we 
have in the program. It is being handled ac-cordingly due to the severity of his actions.” 
According to "Fightin’ Gators", Jackson’s 
armed robbery charge is expected to be dropped.
Jackson was expected to be a part of the 
rotation in the defensive backfield in the up-coming football season. McElwain and co-defensive coordinator Geoff Collins praised Jackson’s athletic ability during Spring prac-tice.
Jackson received a medical redshirt last 
season after suffering a season-ending shoul-der injury.
He finished his career at Florida after ap-
pearing in one game.J.C. Jackson reportedly dismissed from UF football teamDonovan heads to NBA
“W e don’t condone any of his actions 
and it is not something that reflects 
on the expectations we have in 
the program. It is being handled 
accordingly due to the severity of his 
actions.”

Gymnastics
Less than a week removed from 
a third-consecutive national cham-
pionship, Rhonda Faehn shocked 
the UF gymnastics program. 
The Florida head coach of 13 
years informed the school on April 
23 that she would be leaving to 
become the senior vice president 
of USA Gymnastics, an opportu-nity that will allow her to impact the sport on a much broader scale. 
Faehn said the decision was hard to 
make given the relationship she has with the school and her gymnasts, but her passion for Elite gymnas-
tics made the offer something she 
couldn’t turn down.
On May 9, Florida named Au-
burn associate head coach Jenny Rowland as Faehn’s replacement.
Rowland was named the Co-
Associate Head Coach of the Year in 2015, helping lead the Tigers to their ﬁ  rst Super Six in 22 years and 
playing a large role in Auburn’s re-
cruiting and in-gym coaching. 
Before joining Auburn’s staff in 
2010, Rowland served as a national 
and international judge for four 
years and was part of Oklahoma’s coaching staff from 2001-06.
She inherits a team with nine re-
turning gymnasts, including Olym-
pian Bridget Sloan and freshmen 
stars Alex McMurtry and Kennedy Baker.

Dante Fowler
Dante Fowler Jr. may have been 
selected near the top of the NFL Draft, but it’s unlikely he will see 
the ﬁ  eld again soon. 
During the Jaguars’ ﬁ  rst rookie 
minicamp on Friday, Fowler tore 
the ACL in his left knee. He is ex-
pected to miss the rest of the season, and as 
of now, there is no timetable 
for when he will 
have surgery to repair his knee.  
Fowler was 
the No. 3 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jag-uars on April 30. He ﬁ  nished his UF career with 140 tackles, 34 of them for loss and 14.5 sacks. He didn’t 
miss a game during his three-year 
career at Florida, appearing in all 37 games. 
Fowler was expected to ﬁ  t into 
Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley’s defensive scheme at the Leo posi-tion. The Leo position is the weak-
side edge rusher along the defensive 
line, much like the BUCK position Fowler played in at Florida.Fowler, however, is remaining 
optimistic about the injury and that 
he’ll return in better shape after re-
habbing his knee. 
“This gives me time to get my 
body bigger and stronger and I’ll be back better than ever,” Fowler said 
on his Twitter account (@dante-
fowler).

Tennis  
The No. 5-ranked Florida wom-
en’s tennis team advanced to the NCAA Tournament Round of 16 on Saturday after ﬁ  rst and second round victories over Bethune-Cook-
man and Georgia Tech, respective-
ly.
Freshman Josie Kuhlman se-
cured her second-straight NCAA 
singles victory with a 6-3, 6-2 defeat 
of Georgia Tech’s Rasheeda McA-doo. The Ponte Vedra native helped Florida sweep the Yellow Jackets in doubles play, winning 8-2 on the 
No. 2 court with sophomore partner 
Belinda Woolcock.
Next, the Gators (23-3) travel to 
Waco, Texas, to take on the winner 
of a second round match between 
No. 27 Arizona State and the victor of the ﬁ  rst round match between No. 12 Oklahoma State and Boston University on Friday at 5 p.m. at 
Baylor’s Hurd Tennis Center.
The Gators men’s tennis team 
saw its season end at the racquets of Pepperdine on Friday in a 4-3 de-
feat in the ﬁ  rst round of the NCAA tournament.
Despite clinching the early dou-
bles point, the Gators (14-9) would lose on the No. 1, 3, 4 and 6 singles spots, ultimately sealing the defeat.
“We have to be physically and 
mentally tougher,” UF men’s tennis 
head coach Bryan Shelton said in a release. “I think our real weakness 
this year is that we weren’t men-tally tough enough. We just didn’t play with enough conviction and 
conﬁ  dence in the key moments of 
matches.”

Women’s Golf  
UF ﬁ  nished its NCAA Regional 
tournament in Raleigh, North Caro-
lina, on Sunday at 38-over-par to 
ﬁ  nish eighth in an 18-team ﬁ  eld. 
All ﬁ  ve Gators ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  nal 
team tournament of the season with 
over-par scorecards. The team’s eighth-place ﬁ  nish wasn’t enough to qualify the Gators for the NCAA 
Championship.
Sophomore Karolina Vlckova 
shot 1-over-par for the tournament 
and qualiﬁ  ed as an individual for the NCAA Championship in Braden-
ton, Florida, beginning on May 22. 
The Czech Republic native’s eighth-place ﬁ  nish was the ﬁ  fth top-10 ﬁ  n-ish of her second season. Vlckova 
played in the NCAA Championships 
last season for the Gators and ﬁ  n-ished the four-round tournament at 22-over-par and tied for 98th. This will be the ﬁ  rst time Vlckova will 
compete for an individual NCAA 
title.
The Gators will return ﬁ  ve of 
seven golfers next season and lose 
seniors Camilla Hedberg and Anna 
Young to graduation. Hedberg played in nine of the Gators 11 
tournaments this season and tallied 
two top-10 ﬁ  nishes with a stroke average of 76.3 per round. Young amassed four top-25 ﬁ  nishes in ﬁ  ve tournaments this season for the 
Gators. Vlckova, sophomore Maria 
Torres and freshman Taylor Tom-linson will return next season.

The Florida lacrosse team’s sea-
son came to a close on Sunday in the 
Sweet 16 round of the NCAA Tour-nament.
The No. 11 Gators (15-6) fell to 
No. 2 North Carolina (16-3) 11-6 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to close Florida’s 2015 campaign. The Gators were held to a season-low-tying six goals with just four players register-ing in the scoring column.
Florida’s season began on Feb. 7 
in Gainesville with a highly antici-pated matchup against the Tar Heels. 
The Gators lost that game 17-11. 
Despite a strong year the rest of 
the way, Florida was ultimately un-
able to return the favor to UNC by winning on their opponents’ home field.
The Gators kept Sunday’s game 
competitive early, but were unable to keep up with the offense of the 
Tar Heels. UNC’s defense was stingy 
and didn’t allow Florida to get a lot of opportunities on goal. 
Senior Shannon Gilroy scored 
two goals and had three draw con-trols in her final game as a Gator. Sophomore Mollie Stevens added another goal, bringing her consecu-tive goal-scoring streak to 25 games 
— a program record that Stevens will 
look to improve upon next season. 
This was the fifth consecutive 
season that Florida had made it to the second round of the NCAA Tour-nament. The Gators end the season as the 11th ranked team in the coun-try, scoring 326 goals this season — currently the most in the nation.TUESDAY, MAY 12, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15

Florida loses in NCAA Tournament
FLORIDA PLAYS ITS 
FINAL SEC SERIES THIS 
WEEKEND.
By Ian Cohen
Alligator Staff Writer
@icohenb
 
Entering last weekend, Flori-
da needed to address two glaring 
issues before returning home for the season’s final three games: 
inconsistencies among its pitch-
ing staff and struggles on the road. 
After facing 
Vanderbilt in Nashville, Ten-nessee, Florida 
appeared to solve them. 
The Gators 
won two out of three games against the 
defending NCAA champions in their most impressive road per-formance of the season.
Most importantly, UF’s Nos. 
1 and 2 pitchers played well — 
Logan Shore allowed one run 
in seven innings and A.J. Puk struck out a career-high 12 bat-ters in his best start of the sea-son.
The week before, Puk struck 
out 11 batters in a 3-2 win over Georgia. Prior to that, the sopho-more had pitched only sparingly in the last month — the result of an arrest for trespassing in April combined with poor per-
formances in his last several ap-
pearances.Against South Carolina on 
April 11, he allowed two runs in three innings in relief of Dane Dunning, and in an April 21 mid-week against Bethune-Cookman, Puk was pulled in a relief role af-
ter failing to record an out.
However, if Puk continues 
to play the way he has the last 
two weekends, and Shore and the rest of UF’s relievers con-tinue their string of success, the No. 6-ranked Gators will have a pitching staff that can arguably match up with any team in the 
country.
Road woes fixed
Florida began the season with 
problems on the road, and un-
derstandably so — UF usually plays anywhere from three to five freshmen, and its inexperi-
ence was apparent early on.
But as the season progressed, 
so did the Gators.
Florida earned its first series 
sweep on the road in an April 
matchup with Mississippi State. The following two weeks, UF took two out of three games against Georgia and Vanderbilt, 
and will end the season with a 
12-9 road record.
But while Florida’s regular 
season road results don’t nec-essarily predict postseason out-comes — UF went 14-8 on the road in both 2012 and 2014, but made it to the College World Se-ries in 2012 and lost in Regionals 
in 2014 — UF will still be look-
ing at this year’s road matches as a barometer of how they can expect to play come tournament time.UF seeing progression

For the third time in school histo-
ry, the Florida softball team has been 
named the No. 1 overall seed in the 2015 NCAA Softball Tournament.
With an overall record of a 50-6, the 
Gators were seeded atop the 64-team tournament during Sunday night’s se-lection show. 
UF will round out a top four that 
features Oregon, Michigan and Auburn. 
“I saw the word ‘expectations’ next 
to being the No. 1 seed, but I think our team’s really handled the challenge 
of embracing just what this season’s 
meant after winning the national cham-pionship last season,” Walton said 
on the SEC Network. “When you’re a 
Gator you always get everybody’s best 
shot.”
Florida earned the top spot, guaran-
teeing the Gators home-field advantage 
throughout the tournament, despite 
getting knocked out of last weekend’s Southeastern Conference Tournament 
Championship in a 2-1 loss to Tennes-
see in the semifinals. 
But the Gators did win the SEC regu-
lar season championship with an 18-5 
record in arguably the toughest confer-ence in softball. 
The No. 1 seed is the first for the 
Gators since 2009, in which Florida finished in second place in the NCAA Women’s College World Series.
 The 2008 squad also earned the 
No. 1 seed, but finished tied for third in the WCWS despite winning an NCAA-record 70 games that season.
Last year’s national championship 
team was seeded fifth overall.
The Gators will host one of the tour-
nament’s 16 regional sites in Gainesville at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium from 
May 15-17.
This marks the 13th straight season 
Florida will host a regional in Gainesville 
and the 16th time in the team’s 19-year history that they will host a regional.
The four teams in this year’s 
Gainesville Regional include Florida, Florida A&M (18-37), Florida Atlantic (37-17-1) and Hofstra (37-12-1).
 The Gators haven’t played any of 
the three teams this season. 
FAU and Hofstra will open play Fri-
day at 3:30 p.m., while UF follows with its first game versus FAMU at 6 p.m.
This weekend’s play is set up in 
double-elimination format. 
The winner of the Gainesville Re-
gional will advance to a Super Regional 
against the winner of the South Bend 
Regional, which includes Kentucky, Ball State, Northwestern and No. 16 seed Notre Dame.
Whichever of the two regional win-
ners has the higher seed will host the Super Regional.
Last year, UF won the Gainesville 
Regional that included FAMU, Stetson 
and UCF before defeating Washington 
in the Super Regional round to advance to the WCWS.
Just like the 2014 regional round, 
the Gators will play FAMU in their first 
game this year.

ley threw the first no-hitter in Florida

WASHINGTON — The Atlanta 
Hawks beat the Washington Wiz-
ards 106-101 on Monday night 
behind Jeff Teague’s 26 points, 
including a key 3, to even their second-round series at two games apiece.
Two days after hitting a buzzer-
beater to win Game 3, Washing-ton’s Paul Pierce missed a 3-point attempt that would have tied the score with less than 10 seconds 
left.
Al Horford had 18 points and 10 
rebounds and Paul Millsap added 
19 points, six assists and five re-
bounds, as three of Atlanta’s four 
All-Stars played significant roles.
Washington’s lone All-Star, 
point guard John Wall, missed a third consecutive game with a bro-
ken left hand.
Game 5 is Wednesday night at 
Atlanta.
The Hawks led most of the 
game, but Washington cut the defi-
cit to 101-97 with under 2 minutes remaining. Teague’s 3-pointer with 72 seconds left got the margin back to seven.Still, after Washington’s Bradley 
Beal blocked a shot by Dennis Sch-roder in the lane to keep Atlanta’s lead at 104-101, the Wizards had 
the ball and called a timeout with 
9.5 seconds remaining. They got Pierce an open look at a 3, but it 
went off the rim.
The Wizards, seeded fifth in the Eastern Conference, entered Mon-day with the best record in these 
playoffs at 6-1, including 3-0 at home. And they got terrific perfor-mances from Beal, with a career playoff-high 34 points, seven as-
sists and six rebounds, and Pierce, 
with 22 points, including five of Washington’s 12 makes from be-yond the arc.
It was Pierce who banked in a 
21-foot fadeaway jumper for the winner on Saturday. 
Washington had blown all of a 
21-point, fourth-quarter lead as the 
Hawks used a small-ball lineup of 
reserves to pull even with less than 15 seconds left.
When Pierce’s inside basket a 
little under 3 minutes into the sec-ond half got Washington within 65-64, Atlanta responded with a 9-2 run, with all the points coming from Teague and Pero Antic, push-
ing its lead back to 10 going into 
the fourth quarter.
The Hawks’ All-Star quartet — 
Teague, Millsap, Horford and Kyle 
Korver — combined for 43 points in 
the first half, only one fewer point than they totaled in all of Game 3.
Wall, meanwhile, again was 
limited to cheerleading. 16   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, MAY 12, 2015
