Starting May 31, Gainesville will 
see nine days of no sales tax intend-
ed to help residents stock up on sup-plies for the hurricane season. 
Approved by Gov. Rick Scott on 
May 12, Florida House Bill 5601 was signed to start the tax holiday a day before the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season that begins on June 1 and ends on Nov. 30. 
By signing the packet, Scott de-
clared that sales tax cannot be collect-ed from May 31 to June 8 in Florida 
on certain items to aid in hurricane 
emergencies. The bill speciﬁ  es ﬂ  ash-lights that sell for $20 or less, tarps for $50 or less, ﬁ  rst-aid kits for $30 or less, fuel containers for $25 or less, small household batteries for $30 or less and a portable generator for $750 or less. The bill excludes auto-motive and boat batteries. 
The list of tax-exempt items does 
not include some items referenced by the National Weather Service on the government’s readiness website: Suggested supplies such as toilet pa-per, garbage bags, water, manually powered tools and local maps are missing from the list of objects. 
Additional items like plasticware 
and feminine supplies are not cov-ered by the new bill. 
Even though portable fuel-pow-
ered generators will see a sales tax exemption, fuel will not. Historical-ly, fuel prices rise during large natu-ral occurrences, such as tornadoes or hurricanes.  
Hurricane-preparedness tax re-
lief is one part of a three-part series of sales tax holidays established by Scott. As a part of the “It’s Your 
Money Tax Cut Budget,” more than 
$121 million in taxes from the $500-million planned tax and fee cuts are

Riders who usually pay the $3 fee for an 
All Day bus pass will receive one for no cost 
on Wednesday.
Gainesville’s Amalgamated Transit 
Union and Regional Transit System are 
pairing up to provide this Fare Free Day 
to bring attention to a transportation bill, the MAP-21 Reauthorization Act, going through Congress. Riders can get a pass at the Rosa Parks RTS Downton Station or on the bus.
Among other things, MAP-21 provides funding for facilities, new program starts and buses, wrote Chip Skinner, RTS mar-keting and communications supervisor, in an email interview. 
The bill will provide long-term funding 
that will give state and local governments the opportunity to improve and expand the nation’s transportation infrastructure, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works’ website
Cassandra Roldan, a 23-year-old 
Gainesville resident, said she regularly buys an All Day pass.
Roldan said she appreciates the bus sys-
tem providing this service, but thinks there should be more done to market the event. 
“They should advertise it on the bus,” 
she said. Free RTS on Wednesday to

A Gainesville-based animal research group 
working in Papua New Guinea recently en-
countered something no one had seen in years — the New Gregorian Monkey-Faced Fruit Bat.
The Lubee Bat Conservancy discovered one 
of the most endangered bat species on the Solo-mon Islands after no sightings in ﬁ  ve years.
Brian Pope, Lubee Bat Conservancy direc-
tor, said the research team got together with a local group of Australian researchers to study and capture the bats.
“These type of bats are so rare that any type 
of research would be beneﬁ  cial to the species,” 
Pope said.
This bat hasn’t been researched for 20 years.These elusive mammals are hard to spot 
because their habitat is disappearing at a rapid 
rate. The rainforest these bats call home is not protected, Pope said.
 Gabby Milanes, a 20-year-old UF entomol-
ogy and nematology senior, said it’s important to educate people about the impact  humans have on their own environment.
“A lot of animals have become extinct be-
cause people don’t realize that their actions affects the animals that live around them,” she said.Local conservancy helps

In two years, Depot Av-
enue will have roundabouts, 
landscaping and decorative 
lighting. But for now, it’s 
closed to trafﬁ  c for construc-tion. 
Work began Monday on 
the section between South Main and Southwest 11th Street, near Sorority Row and Royal Village apartments.
Trafﬁ  c on Main Street will 
be unaffected, but Depot Avenue will be closed west 
of Main Street, said proj-
ect manager John Veilleux. Drivers can detour through Southwest Fourth, South-west Fifth or Southwest 16th avenues to get to Southwest 
Sixth Street.
The reconstruction is pro-
jected to be ﬁ  nished by sum-
mer 2016, Veilleux said.
“We think two years is a good duration to make it so 
the contractor will be busy, 
but he should have time to accommodate for weather and such,” he said. “We’ve 
got enough time in there to 
account for delays.”
The $6.5-million project 
is funded mostly through a county incentive grant, 
but also with money from 
Gainesville Regional Utilities for the utility and wastewater work, Veilleux said. The rest 
is from local funds, which are 
bonds owned by the city.
The largest part of the proj-
ect will be the three round-
abouts located at Southwest 
11th Street, Southwest Sixth Street and South Main Street, which were chosen to better match the ﬂ  ow of trafﬁ  c.
“It allows us to keep traf-
ﬁ  c moving, predominantly,” Veilleux said. “People won’t just be waiting at a light and not able to go anywhere.”
But the roundabouts 
aren’t a positive addition for 
everyone.
Avid biker Nathaly Ruiz, 
a 21-year-old UF English se-
nior, said bikers ﬁ  nd round-
abouts confusing and scary.
“It’s more dangerous be-
cause you just have to go 
when you think its safe. There are no lights or signals,” she 
said. “It kind of seems like at 
any point, something could come around and hit you.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 20, 2014

The tax break covers ﬂ  ashlights, batteries, tarps and generators
going back to Florida taxpayers, according to 
the Florida government’s website. 
Tax breaks on school supplies and energy-
efﬁ  cient appliances are included in the bill as well. 
John Fleming, the communications director 
for the Florida Retail Federation, said he is ex-cited about the new sales tax holiday.
“Florida has done this before,” Fleming 
said. “It is a good way to allow people to stock up.”
The bill helps people become aware of 
what they need, he said. And retailers beneﬁ  t from these tax holidays, too. 
“The state had a lot more tax revenue com-
ing in,” Fleming said. “It’s a great thing for consumers in Florida.”
HB 5601 creates sales tax exemptions on 
child car seats, bicycle helmets, college meal plans, therapeutic pet foods and cement mix-
ers. It also reduces the tax on electricity. 
This is the largest broad-based tax cut that has been implemented in a decade, according 
to the website.
Steven Milian, an assistant supervisor at 
Zell’s Hardware, located on 3727 W. Univer-sity Ave., was unaware of the new bill’s pass-
ing, but knows customers will take advantage 
of it. 
“I can only see an advantage to get the sup-
plies that they need,” he said. 
Milian said he knows that items listed on 
the bill will go up in sales at Zell’s, and he ex-pects more customers to take advantage of the tax holiday at the store.
“We don’t have any plans for advertise-
ment,” Milian said. “However, we will be mentioning it to customers.”HURRICANE , from page 1Depot Avenue construction closes roads

In several states, texting 911 for help is the 
newest way to summon police, but Florida is 
not among them.
Starting last Thursday, select locations in 
the U.S. can text 911 in an emergency situa-
tion, provided their cellphone carrier sup-
ports the service, according to the Federal Communications Commission.
The FCC proposed a rule that would re-
quire all cellphone providers to support this texting feature by Dec. 31.
Maj. Brad Barber, spokesman for Uni-
versity Police, said UF already has similar resources.
Blue light emergency phone systems are 
installed around the UF campus, and UPD monitors these phone systems constantly.
“Any method that helps expedite getting 
law enforcement ofﬁ  cers to an incident loca-tion would be beneﬁ  cial,” Barber said.
Ivette De Santiago, a 20-year-old UF art 
and technology junior, said when calling for help, authorities can hear the tone of your 
voice and sense immediacy. But in some situ-
ations, calling might not be an option. 
“If you are being abused, you won’t want 
to pick up the phone and call,” De Santiago said. “You can be more inconspicuous with texting.”States start

UF’s presidential search 
committee unanimously con-
firmed changes to the presiden-tial search criteria at a meeting Monday, mostly strengthening 
the focus on UF’s preeminence 
campaign.
Fluency in a second language 
was swapped for “meaningful international or multicultural experience,” and a new criteria calling attention to UF’s diver-sity, particularly in liberal arts and technology, was added. 
Steven Scott, chair of the search committee, said his per-sonal research into presidential 
criteria showed that the com-
mon denominator was aca-demic achievement. 
“This is a person who should 
easily be recognized by faculty at our university and around the nation and world, who has done something extraordinary with his or her career,” he said.
Susan Cameron, a presiden-
tial search committee member, said that the chosen candidate 
is not expected to meet all of the 
suggested criteria.

sessed under the totality of the 
qualifications,” she said.

Gainesville Police arrested two men and a 
woman for having .4 grams of cocaine, a crack 
pipe, weed and giving a false ID after a traffic stop on Sunday, officials said.   
Officers arrested 44-year-old Michael Pip-
penger on drug possession, driving with a suspended license and giving a false ID. Of-ficers also arrested 33-year-old Jared Fearing on drug possession and 39-year-old Nikki Knudsvig on violation of probation, according to an arrest report. 
The officer pulled Pippenger over at about 
5:30 p.m. for illegal tint near the 1000 block of Northwest Sixth Street.
While walking up, the officer smelled mari-juana coming from the car. 
Pippenger told the officer that he did not 
have his driver’s license on him, according to the report. He said he owned the car and pro-vided Jonathan Branchik, 61, as his identity.
Pippenger did not appear to be 61, the of-
ficer said, and the photo on the actual license did not look like Pippenger. He said that he was in a car accident two years ago and lost weight, according to the report.
When Pippenger was detained, officers 
found out his real identity. He spontaneously admitted to lying because his license was sus-pended, according to the report. 
Officers booked Pippenger, Fearing and 
Knudsvig in the Alachua County Jail at about 6:30 p.m. As of press time, their bonds are set at $7,000, $7,000 and $6,000, respectively. 
�GM RECALLED 2.7 MILLION 
CARS.
GRAHAM HACK
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Despite consumer concerns 
about General Motors Co., 
Gainesville dealerships have felt lit-tle to no impact after recent recalls. 
GM recalled a total of about 2.7 
million vehicles Thursday, the larg-est recalls being Chevy Malibus with numerous issues spanning over models from 2004 to 2012 and 
2014, according to its website. 
Don Close, owner of Don Close 
Auto Direct located at 2629 N. Main 
St. next to Northside Shopping Cen-ter, said he has not seen any change in sales of GM vehicles caused by the the recalls. 
“I’ve been to auctions all around 
the area and people still buy GM just as much,” Close said. “I think 
today’s generation of drivers is 
more willing to forget the past and look forward.”
Mike Brewster, sales manager at Tomlinson Motor Company, said he, too, has not seen any decline in GM sales.
“It has not affected the (used) 
market whatsoever,” Brewster said. 
“The American public has a very 
short memory.”
While there has been little im-
mediate effect on GM sales around Gainesville, consumers have ex-pressed concerns.
As a 2008 Chevy Malibu owner, 
Brennan Mace said he has reserva-tions about buying from GM again.
“It’s extremely worrying,” Mace 
said, a 16-year-old high school stu-dent at Cornerstone Academy. “If I had to choose right now, I’d buy Ford.”GPD arrests 3 for drug possession and probation violation

Common Core part 
of the gay agenda?
Yesterday, the Chicago Tribune published a compelling 
editorial defending Common Core, a set of proposed educational standards for U.S. students that was met 
ﬁ  rst with overwhelming support and then with vitriol.
The Common Core debate is pretty messy and, as you may 
have guessed, mired by political interest. Common Core was 
embraced by the Obama administration in 2009 and thus de-fected by the GOP — who, according to the Tribune, said that though the program wasn’t a government production, still car-ried “a strong whiff of federal intrusion into local schooling.”
Objectively, Republicans have a good point. Where does the 
line between help and intrusion lie? 
Rather than adding to an intelligent debate on improving 
education, Florida Rep. Charles Van Zant, R-Keystone Heights, is making headlines for claiming that Common Core will make Florida youth turn gay. 
During a speech in an Orlando “Operation Education Con-
ference,” Zant said that those implementing Common Core are “promoting as hard as they can any youth that is interested in the LGBT agenda,” and that they want to “attract every one of your children to become as homosexual as they possibly can.”
Ah, the old “gay agenda” argument. Not to speak on behalf 
of all LGBT people, but isn’t the only thing on the “gay agenda,” like, equal rights? And an end to discrimination and homopho-bic/transphobic bullying and assault? And a second season of “Looking”? 
Zant, unsurprisingly, has been caught in preposterous lies 
before. According to PolitiFact Florida, in 2013, while advocat-ing for the criminalization of abortion based on the race or sex of the fetus, Zant claimed, “Abortionists have reduced our black 
population by more than 25 percent since 1973.”
PolitiFact deemed that “wildly incorrect.” 
Zant’s statements about Common Core are, additionally, 
wildly incorrect. 
In order to understand the reasoning behind Common Core, 
one must be aware of the context. No other nation in the world, Diane Ravitch told the  Washington Post, has “inﬂ  icted so many changes or imposed so many mandates on its teachers and pub-lic schools as we have in the past dozen years.” 
Ravitch, an education historian who has become the leader 
of the movement against corporate-inﬂ  uenced school reform, went on to point out that both Republican and Democratic agen-das surrounding education reform have nothing to do with im-proving education or creating equal opportunity for students. Instead, she argues, both parties want to cut costs, standardize education and shift delivery of education from high-cost teach-ers to low-cost technology. Common Core was caught in the center of the desire to standardize and gut American education. 
Rather than ﬁ  xing the public education problem, it only added 
to the sense that American education is just a standardized test-based meritocracy. 
Common Core has its problems, yes. But Florida needs more 
than a hate-speech-spewing bigot when it comes to repairing public education and ﬁ  nding a solution. 
And please: Enough with “the gay agenda.”

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Have you bought your 
textbooks yet? Today’s question: Are you prepared for hurricane 
season?College introduced me to some great things: keg 
parties, Midnight Cookies and a lack of dress code I had previously never enjoyed. 
When I lived at home, my mom refused to let me out of 
the house wearing shorts that had holes or frayed hems. 
And my high school required my shorts to hit mid-thigh 
and my shirts to fully cover my shoulders.
So imagine my delight when I found out that I could 
wear anything, from pajamas to dresses so skimpy, they 
could count as lingerie, to class. 
But some people are still struggling with dress codes 
and rules regarding what to put on their own bodies. 
Enter Clare, a home-schooled student from Richmond, 
Virginia, who was kicked out of her prom for wearing a dress that might cause “impure thoughts” from males, according to some of the male chaperones. 
The dress was silver and ﬁ  ngertip-length, which met 
the one rule stipulated by the prom coordinators, accord-ing to a blog post Clare wrote last week. This, of course, is complete bull in how gendered it is. 
It makes sense, though. Most dress codes are gen-
dered, just as this one, which highlights the double stan-
dards against women in terms of clothes and body ex-
posure.
Many dress codes or standards of dress are stricter to-
ward women because women’s bodies are seen as public 
property. It’s more acceptable for men to dictate what is 
appropriate for women to wear and do, as the male chap-erones did to Clare, than for a female to do the reverse. 
This is apparent in many everyday, offhand comments. 
It’s a normal occurrence for men to judge women’s cloth-ing — pause for a montage of men saying high-waisted shorts are unattractive — but I’ve never actually heard a girl say that cargo shorts are unappealing on men. 
This issue also stems from the fact that female bod-
ies are more sexualized than male bodies. If you don’t think that’s true, think of it this way — if a girl posted a picture on Facebook with a very low-cut top, you would probably sooner 
call her a slut than you would a 
boy who posted a shirtless pho-to, even if he was showing more skin. 
Not to mention that the body 
part in question here, Clare’s legs, are not even a typically sexual body part. It’s ridiculous that we’re regulating the exposure of thighs or shoulders — if you are so turned on by my mid-thigh that you cannot focus on your school-
work, or that you start thinking “impure thoughts,” then 
we have a bigger issue here. 
And that’s what this all really comes to. Women are 
being forced to take responsibility for how other people 
view them. Clare said it well when she stated that this 
ordeal “(implied) that it is my responsibility to control other people’s thoughts and drives.” 
If an individual wears a short dress or a low-cut top, 
sure, someone might ﬁ  nd that attractive. But how that 
person reacts to that attraction is an issue for that person 
to handle.
It’s not our responsibility as individuals, or as wom-
en, to dress so that men do not constantly have erections 
based on what we wear.
Clare said it best when she ended her article by say-
ing, “And if you think I am, then maybe you’re part of 
the problem.”
We need to stop judging the sexuality of others — 
whore, slut, prude — based on what they wear. We might not still have a dress code, but the repercussions of past dress codes still exist. Don’t let them make you part of the problem Clare warned against.

Gone are the days of NBC’s hit political 
drama “The West Wing,” and President Josiah Bartlet’s ﬁ  ctional administration 
is but a distant memory. Although Bartlet was a democratic commander in chief, viewers of 
all political persuasions gravitated toward the 
fair-minded and principled president. Ameri-ca ﬁ  nally had its utopian chief executive, albeit one from a scripted primetime drama.
Contemporary political television shows, 
it’s safe to say, are not as inspirational and uplifting. ABC’s “Scandal,” Netﬂ  ix’s “House of Cards” and HBO’s “Veep” attract the most attention and critical acclaim. Their stories 
revolve around a presidential affair, a Ma-
chiavellian politico who rose from the House of Representatives to the White House and a gaffe-prone vice president, respectively. Thank goodness they are all ﬁ  ctitious! 
Each of these representations of Washing-
ton, D.C., and the political processes reﬂ  ect the sentiments of the population. “The West Wing” — which spanned the Clinton and sec-
ond Bush presidencies — viewers were hope-
ful of the promise of the new millennium. 
Fast forward to today, and the nation has 
become disillusioned with that promise of hopeful politics. While Americans are fed up with the political status quo, these shows indulge the population’s jaded yearnings. 
Real-life politicians are seen as 
either worthy of parody on late-night television shows or too out 
of touch with the common man. 
Gridlock is commonplace in the capital. But rest assured, citizens, Hollywood is happy to oblige.  
But oddly enough, Holly-
wood’s take on Washington persuades view-ers to entertain a conservative view of the gov-ernment. 
Take “House of Cards”: Frank Underwood, 
the brooding politician whose obsession with power is that of legends, enters into the politi-cal arena for all of the wrong reasons. Instead of representing the needs and concerns of his district, he manipulates other politicians, the media and even his constituents for his own gain. Underwood eventually becomes the most powerful man in Washington. As Un-derwood conﬁ  des to the audience, his co-con-
spirators, “Democracy is so overrated.” 
The conservative critique of this show is 
fairly obvious: With an adherence to the Con-
stitution, keeping politicians accountable for their actions, limiting the scope of government and enacting term limits, Underwood’s rise to power would not take place. One man should have all of that power. Should citizens be a little suspicious of those in power? Probably.      
Now consider the comedy 
“Veep.” Like “House of Cards” and our actual government, poli-ticians and their staff on the show act in their own self-interest. And 
like our actual government, comedic situa-tions are always around the corner. Botched press releases and poorly planned book tours fuel humorous workplace tensions. On the 
show, Vice President Selina Meyer and her 
staff often ridicule and reprimand each other because of the constant frustration of running the country, partly caused by their own gross ineptness. Despite her future political aspira-tions, Meyer is unable to control her staff, let alone the No. 2 spot in government. 
One would assume conservatives would 
be quick to point out that such characters hold 
power and operate in the government. That 
should not surprise anyone. What should surprise many is the fact that Washington in-siders are quick to tell the actors and produc-tion team on “Veep” how true to life the show actually is. The insiders confess that each staff has its  own Amy, Gary, Ben and — gasp — Jonah. To any fan of the show or any fan of our government, that statement should be cause for concern. Then again, if the situations on “Veep” are as true to life as they appear to be, 
the causes of the shortcomings in Washington 
should not be that much of a surprise. 
Churchill famously said that “the best ar-
gument against democracy is a ﬁ  ve-minute conversation with the average voter.” The conversation can now be extended to those in the government, provided they do not mess it up.  
The conservative arguments for these 
shows are quite clear: When the government grows too big, when politicians enter into the arena for the wrong reasons, when the media is in cahoots with elected ofﬁ  cials and when citizenship becomes a spectator sport, these shows become more of a reality. It’s easy to laugh at government ineptness or cringe when a congressman reveals his interior motives (or extramarital affairs). But when these happen 
outside of scripted entertainment, the country 
should become concerned. 
Perhaps even more concerning: Conserva-
tives can thank Hollywood for the assistance.

ISLAND GROVE, Fla. — Sliding a 
birdshot round into his Remington 1100 
shotgun, Kinnis Thomas takes aim at one 
of several small, paper targets about 30 
yards into a wooded clearing.
The 69-year-old pauses for a moment 
and then peppers the target in one loud 
bang, hoping to be closer to the bull’s-eye 
than a handful of other contenders and win a delicious prize—a rack of ribs.
At the Island Grove Blueberry Festival, 
which took place Saturday in southeast 
Alachua County, the turkey shoot has 
been around for many years. 
Although it’s certainly one of the high-
lights of the event, attendees also enjoyed 
picking blueberries and shopping for 
mom-and-pop knickknacks throughout the venue. About $10,000 of the event’s proceeds went to support the Cross Creek Volunteer Fire Department.
With smoke blowing from his shotgun 
barrel, Thomas places his gun on a table and grabs a Diet Pepsi and a chair to eye his competition. 
“I could hear ‘em gobble that time,” he 
said, hoping for a strike. 
His first name is John, but people call 
him by his middle name, Kinnis.
Living near Island Grove since he was 
born, Thomas said over the years he has seen the already small town get smaller as farmers moved out of the area. 
But one of the things that hasn’t 
changed is the turkey shoot, which al-ready won him a rack of ribs. He keeps his winning target folded inside his shirt pocket for safekeeping. Traditionally, 
winners received vouchers for a free tur-
key at the local grocery store, but since the holidays aren’t upcoming, the prize is the slab of pork. 
“They call it a blueberry festival for 
the lack of calling it something better,” he said, laughing.
Some women temporarily left their 
husbands to go shopping through the flea-market cluster while the men made their way to the gunfire in the distance. 
One man in particular, 83-year-old 
Donald Faircloth, said he doesn’t remem-ber how many times he’s been to the blue-berry festival but hints that it’s a lot. He’s been in the Gainesville area since before 
43rd Street and 34th Street were even 
built, a project he had a hand in.
“We  built the first stretch of 34th Street 
from Archer Road to Northwest 16th Av-
enue,” said Faircloth, who worked for a 
construction company in 1958. “That’s as far as it went.”
Some years earlier, he was a prospec-
tive UF student, but before he could start 
class, he was swept into service by the U.S. 
government to fight in the Korean War.
“Uncle Sam needed my services before 
I even got started,” he said. 
He served for 10 months before return-
ing home. 
“They shot real bullets at you there,” 
he said.
Although some festival-goers like 
Faircloth have been coming to the Island Grove Blueberry Festival for many years, several first-timers came for a taste of Florida’s blueberry heritage. 
Self-proclaimed Wizard of Odd, Joe 
DiVito, brought homemade hot sauces that go from “mild to wild.” He gave out free samples of his sauces to spread the word about his LaCrosse-based business.
“So far today we’ve only killed seven 
people,” DiVito said, joking. “I use lucid dreaming to come up with my recipes.”
Alachua County’s Aunt Zelma’s Blue-
berries and 301 Blueberries both provid-ed more than 150 cases of berries for the event at discounted prices. 
Everything from fresh blueberry ice 
cream to blueberry goat cheese candy 
was served to children and families at the 
festival. 
And for those who aren’t tired of the 
violet-hued berries, “U-Pick” blueberry 
picking will take place for another two 
weeks at both farms.  TUESDAY, MAY 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Locals expressed their support 
for a bill Gov. Jeb Bush signed into 
law to regulate body piercing. Pro-
fessional body piercers thought it would keep unprofessional, un-qualified piercers out of their busi-
ness. UF student Brooke Curtiss 
said she thought the rules might not work. “Kids are going to do it anyway. They’ll just have their friends. I think they are just using 
sanitation as an excuse to enforce 
conservative values on kids.”

Thanks to a donation to the St. 
Francis House, the homeless peo-
ple of Gainesville had something other than water to enjoy with their lunch from the soup kitchen. 
Nutri-Products donated more than 
2,000 servings of their high-protein drink Go!, which was designed to help athletes recover from training. 
Normally the about 80 homeless 
people who ate the lunch only got a liquid through vegetable soup.

The Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History said goodbye to a T.rex 
named Sue. The four-month-long exhibit brought the museum na-tionwide attention. “The Sue ex-hibit let the community know that 
the museum is playing in the big 
leagues,” museum associate direc-tor Graig Shaak said. He said he estimated attendance to the exhibit 
of the 42-foot skeleton was nearly 
100,000 people. As a follow-up to the popular exhibit, the museum was going to open “Tusks!” that would show the history of Flori-
da’s prehistoric elephants.

Amanda O’Leary and 
the UF lacrosse team fell to Northwestern in the quarterfinals. Read the story on page 16.SEC announces UF’s rotating cross-division opponents in football� GATORS OUTSCORED RE -
GIONAL OPPONENTS 29-0.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
After UF defeated UCF 7-0 in the 
final game of the Gainesville Re-
gional on Sunday to advance to its seventh NCAA Super Regional in program history, coach Tim Walton 
took a moment to remember former 
Gators pitcher Stacey Nelson.
“Every time we go to Super Re-
gionals, I think of her just because she did it first,” Walton said.
When the Gators reached the 
Super Regionals for the first time in 2007, they rode three shutout performances and two complete 
games by the three-time All-Amer-
ican pitcher in the regional rounds as they defeated Stetson, Georgia Tech and Texas by a combined 18-0 score.
Seven years later, No. 5-seed 
Florida accomplished that feat again — shutting out Florida A&M, Stetson and UCF with an aggregate 
29-0 score to clinch a Super Region-
al berth against No. 12-seed Wash-ington that begins Saturday at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
But unlike that 2007 campaign 
when the Gators had Nelson start all three games and pitch 18.1 of 21 innings, the 2014 Florida team used a different pitcher in each regional 
contest.
“At the beginning of the year, I 
thought having three pitchers was 
going to be a huge advantage for us in a situation like this,” Walton said.
“In this kind of setting, in this 
kind of situation playing head-to-head with three different opponents, I think it’s a huge, huge advantage to have not just three pitchers, but three quality pitchers.”
Walton gave freshman Delanie Gourley the nod to start against FAMU on Friday, and she respond-ed by pitching UF’s first postseason 
no-hitter as the Gators cruised to a five-inning, 8-0 victory.
Gourley showed much more 
command in the circle compared to her last start on April 26 against Missouri — a game where she gave 
up four runs and was pulled from the circle in favor of Lauren Haeger 
Alligator File Photo
Delanie Gourley pitches from the circle in Florida’s 2-0 victory against Ole Miss on March 9 at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium. The fresh-
man pitcher tossed the program’s first postseason no-hitter Friday in UF’s 8-0 win against Florida A&M during the NCAA Tournament.

After defeating No. 1-seed Georgia 
in the NCAA quarterfinals on Saturday, 
the Gators couldn’t pull off another up-set in the semifinals.
No. 8-seed Florida (23-6) was swept 
by fifth-seeded UCLA (25-2) 4-0 on Mon-day afternoon.
“I thought we played great, I really 
did,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “But credit (UCLA). They made the shots at the end. I thought we did what we could and I really thought we had chances to win four singles spots going into the match to begin with.”
Before singles play, Florida dropped 
the doubles point for the second time in this year’s NCAA Tournament.
Both doubles matches on Courts 1 
and 2 entered tiebreaks, but the Gators were unable to capitalize in both. Sofie Oyen and Belinda Woolcock fell 8-7 (5), followed by an 8-7 (5) loss from Kourt-ney Keegan and Alexandra Cercone to Bruins halt Gators’ post-
season run with a sweepbAsebAll

Florida’s quest for a seventh Southeast-
ern Conference tournament championship 
begins this week as the top-seeded Gators 
descend upon Hoover Metropolitan Sta-dium.
The Gators’ first pitch of this year’s tour-
nament is Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., and UF 
will face the winner of Tuesday’s eight-nine 
matchup featuring Alabama and Kentucky — the Gators’ seed affords them a first round 
bye. The first four rounds are double elimi-nation to get the field down to four teams 
before the final three games of the tourna-
ment are played in a standard single elimi-nation win-or-go-home format.
With the 13th SEC regular season cham-pionship in school history already clinched, Florida (37-19, 21-9 SEC) failed to sweep eastern division foe Tennessee (31-22, 12-18 
SEC) losing 7-5 to close out the 2014 regular 
season over the weekend.
With nothing to play for, Florida trotted 
out irregular players in its starting lineup 
like catcher Mike Fahrman, left fielder Ryan 
Larson, second baseman Jason Lombardozzi and third baseman Josh Tobias. Regular sec-ond baseman Casey Turgeon got the day off for the first time all season.
Tobias — who had started only one game 
since March 23 — made his presence felt in a big way with a tremendous home run to lead off the third inning that soared over the left-field fence. It was his second home run 
this season and the fifth of his UF career.Florida earns first-round byesee soFt, PA ge 15

Poll Question
Which UF spring sport has been the most impressive 
to you this past semester?2014  at Alabama 
2015  vs. Ole Miss 
2016 at Arkansas 
2017  vs. Texas A&M 2018  at MSU
2019 vs. Auburn 2020 at Ole Miss 2021 vs. Alabama 2022 at TAMU2023 vs. Arkansas 2024 at Auburn 2025 vs. MSU Tobias’ homer was the second 
of two solo shots in consecutive 
innings for Florida — the ﬁ  rst 
was from Gushue playing from the DH spot in the lineup for the ninth time this season. Despite the 
two runs, the Gators still found 
themselves behind 4-2 after three innings.
UF could have added another run in the third after a Harrison Bader ﬂ  yout to left ﬁ  eld. Larson 
attempted to score from third 
base, but instead of sliding into home he attempted to step on the plate that was blocked by the left foot of Tennessee catcher Taylor 
Schultz and Larson became the 
last out of the inning.
Two innings later in the top 
of the ﬁ  fth, the Gators would 
add three runs to their total, and 
take a 5-4 lead thanks to two RBI 
doubles. The ﬁ  rst was laced into 
center ﬁ  eld by shortstop Richie 
Martin and scored Tobias. The second was a Gushue shot down the left-ﬁ  eld line two batters later that scored Bader as well as Mar-
tin. It was Gushue’s second and 
third RBIs of the game.
Tennessee would answer back 
with offensive ﬁ  repower of its own in its half of the ﬁ  fth on two 
RBI singles and a sacriﬁ  ce ﬂ  y.
From then on, Florida ad-
vanced two baserunners all the 
way to third base but was unable to bring them home.
With the victory, the Volun-
teers clinched a berth in the SEC tournament for the ﬁ  rst time in 
seven years. In that 2007 tourna-
ment, Tennessee was an eight seed that upset the top-ranked in-state rival Vanderbilt in the ﬁ  rst round before being knocked out of the 
double elimination tournament. 
The ﬁ  rst loss was to Ole Miss by the score of 6-3, the second was in the rematch with Vanderbilt, a 15-2 shellacking.before the ﬁ  rst out of the game 
was recorded.
In ﬁ  ve innings on Friday, 
the freshman lefty fanned seven of FAMU’s 17 batters to 
bring her strikeout total to 125 
on the season. Gourley’s 1.18 strikeout-per-inning mark is third among all freshmen and 31st in the country.
“Delanie really set the tone 
for us with that (two strike-out) ﬁ  rst inning,” Walton said on Friday. “She really pitched 
well and I’m proud of her in 
her ﬁ  rst postseason start.”
Senior ace Hannah Rogers 
followed Gourley’s perfor-mance with a six-inning, four-hit shutout Saturday as Florida rolled over Stetson 14-0.
Rogers struck out four bat-
ters en route to her 24th win of the season and her 12th career postseason victory.
“I always go out there with 
a lot of energy,” Rogers said on Saturday. “I’m not trying to change anything. I just want to keep doing what I do out there.”
In her career, the Lake 
Wales, Fla., native holds the second-highest marks in UF history in wins (121), complete games (102), innings pitched (950) and strikeouts (809).
Junior Lauren Haeger then 
capped things off for Florida on Sunday by pitching a com-
plete-game shutout of her own 
in UF’s 7-0 win over UCF.
“Hannah’s lights out. Dela-
nie’s lights out,” Haeger said. “I told myself ‘They did it, so you can, too.’”
The Peoria, Ariz., native 
struck out ﬁ  ve batters in the win and dropped her ERA to 
a career-best and team-lead-
ing 1.57. Haeger also holds the Gators’ best marks in op-ponent batting average (.178) (UF’s career mark is .174, Hae-ger is second best all-time) and strikeout-per-walk ratio (3.05:1).
Center ﬁ  elder Kirsti Merritt 
feels it’s a beneﬁ  t that Florida has three different pitchers that can produce in the circle in any given game.
“It’s amazing,” the sopho-
more said. “I love it whenever we get all three pitchers in there. I like having the differ-ent pitches: Delanie’s change-
up, Hannah’s drop ball and 
then Lauren coming out with the hard screwballs.”TUESDAY, MAY 20, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

“Our Court 2, for the ﬁ  rst twenty minutes, I

“I mean we were coughing up balls left and right.”
No. 14 Olivia Janowicz lost to No. 8 Jenni-
fer Brady 6-1, 6-1 to begin singles action. Next, UCLA’s No. 2 Robin Anderson defeated No. 16 Brianna Morgan 6-1, 6-3 to take a 3-0 lead over Florida.
“Once it got into the third hour you could 
feel the match turning a little bit and some of the UCLA players were getting a little more nervous,” Janowicz said. “I feel like if we were out there just a little bit longer the (momen-tum) could’ve shifted. And we almost made it there, but just not today.”
UCLA’s Kaitlin Ray dropped freshman 
Keegan 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 to complete the sweep and eliminate UF from the tournament.“It was clearly a learning 
thing for them,” Thornqvist 
said of Florida’s freshmen. 
“If you look at the UCLA team we played two years ago in the ﬁ  nals, we are very 
similar. And look at where they are now.”
The NCAA singles 
championship will begin on Wednesday, where Cercone, Morgan and Janowicz are all slated to compete.
The doubles championships will begin on 
Thursday, with Janowicz, Keegan, Oyen and Woolcock all earning spots.
“(This season) has meant everything,” 
Janowicz said. “Playing for yourself is totally different and I’m deﬁ  nitely excited, but more than anything I’m more disappointed and sad that I can’t come back and get another cham-pionship with my team. That means so much more to me.”

It was a season of breaking re-
cords and defying expectations.
Despite Florida’s No. 5 rank in 
the national preseason polls, UF 
fans were still concerned with the 
team losing 13 players to graduation 
in 2013 and replacing them with 11 freshmen.
When Florida defeated Ohio 
State 10-9 on March 22 to improve to 10-2 to start the year, fans began to see the impact of the 11 new ad-ditions.
So when Florida lost in the 12-
11 double-overtime game against Northwestern on Saturday, it was a hard pill to swallow for coach Amanda O’Leary.
“I’m just really proud of our 
seniors, what they brought to the table, their leadership, their love, they’re caring and I’m sad for them,” O’Leary said. “They gave so much to 
this program over the course of this 
four years for Krista (Grabher) and ﬁ  ve years for Cara (Canington).”
Attacker Sammi Burgess, mid-
ﬁ  elder Mollie Stevens and defender Caroline Fitzgerald — a trio of fresh-men — became vital players for O’Leary alongside juniors Shannon Gilroy and Nora Barry.
Burgess was one of Florida’s big-
gest recruits before the start of the season. The 5-foot-3 attacker never lost a game during her four years at the McDonogh School in Mary-land and became known at Florida for being a vital scorer when Gilroy failed. 
Stevens also came in as a top re-
cruit but she spent her time in high school as an attacker. When Stevens arrived at Florida, O’Leary immedi-ately moved her to midﬁ  eld in an at-tempt to give other midﬁ  elders, like Sam Darcangelo and Nora Barry, a chance to rest. Stevens completed the season with 38 points and a rep-utation for her ability to score on the fast break.
Fitzgerald became Florida’s go-
to player when it needed someone to guard the opponent’s best scorer. Fitzgerald covered star-offensive players like Syracuse’s Kayla Tre-anor and Northwestern’s Alyssa Leonard. The Mount Sinai, N.Y., native ﬁ  nished the season with the most caused turnovers on defense (22) and 30 ground balls.
Although the freshmen were 
the Gators’ biggest and most unex-pected story of the year, Gilroy also made a splash in the lacrosse com-munity.
The Northport, N.Y., native 
broke the single-season record for most points (106), goals (86) and goals per game (4.15). Gilroy is the 
second-best offensive player in the 
country behind Syracuse’s Treanor.
Even with Gilroy putting points 
on the board, it wasn’t just goals that she brought to the team. In situations like Saturday when Northwestern’s defense controlled Florida’s scoring opportunities and stopped many of their offensive possessions, Gilroy 
used her notoriety as an offensive 
threat to get teammates like Burgess and Barry open for easy goals.
“I need to worry more about my 
teammates more than what I need to do to get open because it’s always really difﬁ  cult for me to get off the ball and get open,” Gilroy said. “So I needed to be really prepared to 
help them and do the best I can for 
them.”
With the disappointment of not 
making it past the quarterﬁ  nals of the NCAA Tournament, Florida will come back in 2015 with one goal in mind: Win a national title.
Senior goalkeeper Cara Can-
ington gave her ﬁ  nal thoughts on 
where the Gators would be in the 
2015 season and it matched that of Florida fans sentiments.
“I think the sky’s the limit for 
this team,” Canington said. “I think there is nothing but great things to 
come.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 20, 2014

Florida is returning to the Sooner State 
for the second time in two weeks. But on this 
trip, the Gators have a chance to win it all.
UF earned a spot in its 24th-overall, and 
fourth-straight NCAA Women’s Golf Cham-
pionship, which begins today and lasts 
through Friday at the par-70 Tulsa Country Club in Tulsa, Okla. 
Florida’s last national championship 
came  nearly 30 years ago in 1986
“We got our ﬁ  rst look at the course yes-
terday, and it is a great venue for this week’s championship,” coach Emily Glaser said in a release. “As you might expect in Oklahoma in the spring, the winds are forecasted to be strong early in the week.”
Glaser will send out Maria Torres, Sarah Schober, Karolina Vlckova, Camilla Hed-berg and Elcin Ulu for the ﬁ  ve-person line-up. The Gators are the eighth-ranked team in the Central Region, which contains nine of the 25 teams in the ﬁ  eld.
UF will tee off in the ﬁ  rst round at 8:30 
a.m. The ﬁ  eld will play 18 holes on each of 
the four days of competition.
“Patience will be a big key to our suc-
cess,” Glaser said. “If we can do this and 
limit our mistakes, we will have a good tournament.”Gators aim to capture ﬁ  rst national title in nearly 30 yearsFlorida loses nail-biter to conference rival in quarterﬁ  nals
