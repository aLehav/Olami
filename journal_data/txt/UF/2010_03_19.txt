Officials obtain shooting-related video
A neighbor filmed the events
By JOEY FLECHAS and ANA GONI-
LESSAN
Alligator Writers
The Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment has a copy of a video showing the
moments leading to the March 2 University
Police Department shooting of UF graduate
student Kofi Adu-Brempong and is exam-
ining the video as part of its investigation.
One of Adu-Brempong's neighbors, who
wishes to be anonymous, said she began
filming when she heard police talking to
the student. The video is about 10 minutes
long.
Spencer Mann, spokesman for the StateAttorney's Office, said the video would
only be made available to the public if the
State Attorney's Office pressed charges and
held an arraignment against any of the of-
ficers involved in the shooting.
Mann said it's too early to say what, if
any, charges will be made.
"We're going to let the facts, the evi-
dence and the state law speak for itself,"
Mann said.
The Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment is investigating the case now. It will
report its findings to the State Attorney's
Office.
The office will assign a prosecutor to re-
view the case before any charges are made.Two of Adu-Brempong's neighbors and
the witness who took the video said they
heard five shots fired.
The neighbors said they heard three
shots, a brief pause and then two more
shots that sounded different than the first
three.
The witness who took the video stopped
filming after hearing the shots.
The witness added that one of the of-
ficers came out of Adu-Breaking Brempong's apartment afterNews the shots were heard, sat
down and put his head in
his hands. Another officer put a hand on
his shoulder.
Sheryl Quail, a graduate student in the
school of forest resources and conservation,
also lives at Corry Village and attended the
UF Board of Trustees meeting at EmersonHall Tuesday to try to present the video.
Quail said she waited until the end of
the meeting to attempt to present it using
her laptop.
But Student Body President Jordan John-
son, who was at the meeting, said Quail
was unable to present the video because the
meeting was adjourned.
Johnson said she interrupted a board
member's speech, and members were sur-
prised by Quail's attempt to present.
"But, you know, we encourage free
speech," Johnson said. "We understand
this is America, and it's important to, you
know, have a good pulse of the feelings of
students on this campus."
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Quail
brought a list of demands to the meeting,
and they were distributed to each member
of the Board of Trustees.
UF MEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators exit tourney
after first-round loss
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
OKLAHOMA CITY -Before
tipping off the first round of the
NCAA Tournament, BYU point
guard Jimmer Fredette asked Chan-
dler Parsons for a small favor.
"No game-winning shots to-
night," Fredette said. "It was kind
of just a little joke, just friendly
competition."
Parsons, whose two game-win-
ners in January were among the
highlights of Florida's season, had
a chance to do exactly what Fre-
dette feared at the end of regulation
Thursday afternoon in the Ford
Center.
The junior forward missed a last-
second turnaround jumper over
Michael Loyd Jr. with the game
tied at 75 to end regulation. Fresh-
man guard Kenny Boynton missed
on the final possession in overtime,
and the Gators (21-13) ended their
season with a 99-92 double-over-
time loss to the Cougars (30-5).
"I felt like I had a good look and
shot it," said Parsons, who finishedwith 20 points, 10 rebounds and six
assists. "I thought it was going to
go down. It rode out. It happens. I'd
like to have the shot again."
Boynton, who finished with 27
points on 8-of-16 shooting, was
forced into a long, contested three-
pointer that fell far short, and senior
forward Dan Werner's attempted
tip-in was off.
"I wasn't really sure how much
time was left so
I just tried to tip
it in," Werner
said after his fi-
nal game at UF.
"Looking back, I
probably should
Parso ns have tried to grab
it, but I didn't
think I could catch it, so I just tried
to get a fingertip on it and get it up
to the rim."
In the second overtime, the
Gators lost their most effective
scorer -Boynton fouled out -
and were clearly too worn down to
keep up with the Cougars.
"We had a hard time scoring
because of fatigue," UF coach Billy

Reitz's summer job fair
draws about 200
Spring hasn't even arrived,
but students were already
thinking about summer plans
at the Summer Job Fair Thurs-
day on the Reitz Union Colon-
nade.
The fair, which was spon-
sored by the Career Resource
Center, featured 27 companies
including Buckle, Gainesville
Health & Fitness Center and
various summer camps. It at-
tracted more than 200 students.
Ja'Net Glover, the CRC assis-
tant director for career events,
said this year's fair featured
a wider variety of employers
than previous years.
"We wanted to diversify
the fair so that students would
have an interest in at least one
of the companies," Glover said.
"There are local companies as
well as companies from across
the country who offered jobs."
Tanya Bansal, a UF comput-
er engineering graduate stu-
dent, said she's having a diffi-
cult time finding a summer job.
"I'm hoping to stay in
Gainesville and work," Bansal
said. "I wanted to try my luck at
the job fair and hand out my re-
sume to different companies."
Dane Henricksen, Buckle
store manager in Gainesville,
said summer is the best time
to apply for a job or internship
with his company.
"We do most of our hiring
during the summer," Henrick-
sen said. "This fair came at the
right time for job opportunities
with us."
-PAIGE LACYCountywide scavenger hunt
to start Saturday
Michael Lee, a UF mechanical
engineering freshman, and three
of his friends have spent almost
every Friday night this semester
driving around Alachua County
trying to plan clues for a scaven-
ger hunt.
"It's basically been taking
over our lives," Lee said.
Soon after he started at UF,
Lee began planning for Midnight
Madness Alachua, a countywide
scavenger hunt, which will take
place Saturday from 7 p.m. to
about 3 a.m. The game is target-
ed toward college students, but
anyone can participate.
Coed teams of four to six peo-
ple will compete for a first-place
prize of about $300. Second place
will also win a cash prize.
The cash prizes will get larger
with an increasing amount of
teams, Lee said. He is hoping for
about 15 teams.
Teams must register and pay
a $35 fee by tonight at 11:59 p.m.
Lee said challenges could be
anything from having to con-
struct something as a team to a
physical activity. There are 10
clues and three to four challeng-
es.
"I don't want to give it away,"
Lee said.

Cars drive 'green' talk
By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
As six environmentally friendly cars rest-
ed on the Reitz Union North Lawn, students
and environmental agencies talked about
the possibility of more energy-efficient cam-
pus transportation options.
Progress Energy, the Eco-Trans Alliance,
Wise Gas Inc. and UF had cars on display
with presentations explaining the alternative
sources of energy, such as ethanol, biodiesel
and electric batteries that the cars use.
Most of UF's transportation runs on gaso-
line, but the Department of Transportation is
planning on expanding the use of alternative
fuels such as ethanol and electricity, said
Jonathan Priest, UF's fleet superintendent.
UF is working specifically on expanding
its use of biodiesel, Priest said.
Biodiesel, which is typically made from
soy beans and animal fat, makes up about
20 percent of energy for a vehicle. The rest
of the energy comes from diesel. Biodiesel
costs $2.65 per gallon, Priest said.
According to the American Automobile
Association, diesel fuel costs $2.928 per gal-Ion.
For fleets, the extra cents add up, Priest
said.
"It's transportation without pollu-
tion and no heavy expenses."
Gregory Hyde
special projects manager of the Eco-Trans
Alliance
Gregory Hyde, the special projects man-
ager of the Eco-Trans Alliance, a company
that uses renewable energy sources for
transportation, said alternative transporta-
tion is the most effective.
"It's transportation without pollution and
no heavy expenses," Hyde said. "People are
intrigued."
During the event, Hyde showed the
cruise car, which looks like a golf cart with
large solar panels placed on its roof.
Cruise cars can run on various sources of
energy, but most run on a combination of so-
lar energy and electric batteries.
Hyde said the cruise car is ideal for a uni-
versity setting because some cars can hold as
many as 14 passengers.Museum to host 'dig'

UF'S GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT.
By LEANDRA VALENTINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tales about snakes more than 40 feet
long will be told, plate tectonics will be
explained with Oreos, and stones will
become jewelry Saturday at the Florida
Museum of Natural History.
The museum, the Gainesville Gem
and Mineral Society and the UF De-
partment of Geological Sciences will
host the fourth annual event, "Can
You Dig It?" from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Between 1,500 and 2,000 people are
expected to attend, and about 30 to 50
UF graduate and undergraduate stu-
dents will volunteer.
"Our students really love what
they do. Geology is a calling," said
Matthew Smith, a UF professor of geo-
logical sciences and the coordinator forthis event.
The museum will have different
stations with educational and inter-
active activities geared for many age
groups. One activity calls for people to
create earthquakes by measuring their
jumping intensities on seismometers,
Smith said.
Because the event is no longer on
a school night, the timing for outside
activities won't be constrained, Smith
said.
On In addition to the in-
CampuS door and outdoor sta-
tions, visitors can view
existing museum exhibits and listen to
geology experts.
Ellen Martin, professor of geologi-
cal sciences at UF, will speak about
global warming.
In the event's past years, Martin
has debated with 10-year-olds about
whether global warming is happen-
sg.

Residents encouraged to
create fake $100 bills
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Usually the creation of counterfeit bills is
discouraged.
But today, those in Gainesville can design
fake $100 bills for a good cause.
Artists and environmentalists alike can
stop by the Dwight H. Hunter Northeast
Pool, 1100 NE 14th St., at 6 p.m. in support
of the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, an effort
to raise awareness about the effects of lead-
poisoned soil.
Participants will create mock $100 bills to
be picked up by the Fundred truck, which will
then transport them to Washington, D.C.
The goal is to collect 3 million mock $100
bills from 125 nationwide collection sites.
The conceptual sum of those bills -$300
million -is the cost to improve soil condi-
tions in New Orleans, said Mary Rubin, the
project's director of national affairs.
Rubin estimated volunteers with the proj-
ect have collected about 400,000 bills so far."It's really important that every-
where, everybody and anybody
makes their Fundred."
Mary Rubin
Fundred Dollar Bill Project director
"It's really important that everywhere, ev-
erybody and anybody makes their Fundred,"
she said.
Rubin said organizers hope the symbolic
bills will encourage the cleanup of lead-con-
taminated soil in New Orleans.
Although lead-poisoned soil is common,
it can result in negative health effects when
absorbed by the skin.
About 30 percent of inner-city children in
New Orleans are affected by the lead-con-
taminated soil, according to the project.
"By creating a Fundred dollar bill, you're
supporting the generational solution to the
health of our communities," Rubin said.

Dentist helps fund revamp
0 THE PEDIATRIC DENTISTRY
FACILITY WILL BE RENOVATED.
By RODD TAVAKOLI
Alligator Contributing Writer
It wasn't in his job description to fund-
raise, but he made a huge impact at the UF
College of Dentistry anyway.
Dr. Robert E. Primosch, a pediatric den-
tist, led the fundraising initiatives for the
renovation of the pediatric dentistry facility
at Shands at UF.
He will be recognized today in a ceremo-
ny at the UF College of Dentistry at 11:45 a.m.
UF President Bernie Machen will speak alongwith other dentists from the facility.
About $750,000 from private donations
raised over the past seven years paid for the
renovations. About 85 percent of the dona-
tions came from alumni.
In 1995, Primosch and Dr. Marcio Guel-
mann, a pediatric den-
Spotlight on the tist at UF's College ofSwamp Dentistry, formed an
alumni group to raise
state money to build a new clinic. However,
the state reneged on their promise to match
dollars, Primosch said.
He said the makeover was much needed.
"The facility was really worn down," Pri-
mosch said. "I wouldn't want my children to
be seen there."

Picnic promotes LGBT pride
More than 150 were served
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Balloons in all colors of the
rainbow floated above the Plaza
of the Americas Thursday after-
noon during the Pride Picnic, a
food giveaway organized by the
LGBT Student Affairs Cabinet.
The picnic served between 150
and 200 students in an hour and
a half.
"We wanted to have a day
where students could come out
and learn about the resources we
have on campus," LGBT Student"Personally, I've had a
good experience being part
of the community here, but
it's not so easy for every-
one."
Cody Talcott
LGBT Student Affairs Cabinet
Director
Affairs Cabinet Director Cody Tal-
cott said. "And what better way
to do it than with free food?"
The Gelato Company donatedgelato, and the organizations pur-
chased picnic foods such as sand-
wiches, wraps and potato salad.
Talcott said the cabinet of-
fers support to students who feel
alienated, discriminated or un-
welcome in social situations due
to their sexuality.
"Personally, I've had a good
experience being part of the com-
munity here, but it's not so easy
for everyone," he said.
Talcott said the cabinet strives
to make UF a friendly and safe
environment for all students, re-
gardless of their sexual orienta-
tion.
"We want every student to feel
comfortable at UF," he said.Council demands
grand jury probe
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Graduate students stood up for one of their own Thursday.
The Graduate Student Council unanimously passed a reso-
lution calling for a grand jury investigation of the shooting of
graduate student Kofi Adu-Brempong by University Police
Department officer Keith Smith on March 2. The resolution will
be sent to the State Attorney's Office and the clerk of the Eighth
Circuit Court.
On Mait Vernon, vice president of the Graduate
Campus Student Council, said a grand jury investigation
will ensure thoroughness and impartiality.
Vernon said UPD is doing an internal investigation of the
shooting, and the university has hired outside investigators.
"Myself and quite a few others feel that this is not the way to
go about this, considering the circumstances," Vernon said.
Members of UPD and colleagues of Adu-Brempong have
been ordered not to speak about the incident until the investi-
gations are complete, Vernon said.
"[The grand jury] will be able to subpoena all the people
who have been muted and have not been able to speak," Ver-
non said.

12 scarf 'nuclear' wings

Alligator Contributing Writer
Sweat, tears and hot wings made
for a fiery smackdown Thursday
night at the Beef 'O' Brady's on West
University Avenue.
About 200 people lined up in
the parking lot of the restaurant
and watched as 12 scarfed wings
during the Nuclear Chicken Wing
Eating Contest, sponsored by the
Student Finance Group and Beef '0'
Brady's.
Beef '0' Brady's manager Mike
Rosas said the restaurant made
about 300 to 400 wings.
Rosas said Beef '0' Brady's also
made a special, extremely spicy
sauce called "the Ghost Habanero
Nuclear Sauce" for the event.
Beef '0' Brady's employees hadto run and grab more wings because
some contestants ate more than 20
wings during the 10-minute time
limit.
"I tried not to think of the
pain when I was eating the
wings."
James DaFonte
contest winner
Phi Gamma Delta's James Da-
Fonte wore a viking costume and
won the contest by eating 29 wings.
DaFonte won $250 for the Red
Cross and a $50 Beef 'O' Brady's gift
certificate for himself.
"I tried not to think of the pain
when I was eating .but it feels great
to win because the money is going
to our philanthropy," he said.

6, ALLIGATOR U FRIDAY, MARCH 19, 2010
Hang in there, Gators, the weekend is almost here. And af-
ter hearing several of you vomiting in our parking lot after a
"successful" St. Patrick's Day, we're sure you're ready for it.
But pull yourselves together long enough for us to present
you with the we're-guessing-a-lot-of-you-never-want-to-see-
green-beer-ever-again edition of.
Darts & Laurels
In other, less disgusting news, Students for a Democratic
Society organized a pretty successful, peaceful protest against
the University Police Department Tuesday.
About 300 people marched to Emerson Alumni Hall to
hand UF's Board of Trustees members a list of demands. Then
about 100 people staged a two-hour sit-in before marching to
Tigert Hall.
So we're going to throw a we-know-you're-angry-but-
thanks-for-keeping-it-peaceful LAUREL to SDS.
You all assembled a lot of angry people but managed to
conduct a peaceful protest.
Now for a group of people not deserving of any praise.
Those pesky Catholic priests are at it again. On Thursday,
CNN reported that a tape surfaced of an 82-year-old priest
from Brazil having sex with a 19-year-old altar boy.
According to the article, there are child abuse allegations
against priests in Ireland, Germany, Austria and the Nether-
lands.
That's why we're going to throw a why-don't-you-try-
giving-up-sex-scandals-for-Lent? DART to dirty Catholic
priests.
On a more positive note, we're glad to see Dennis Kucinich
has come to his senses and decided to support health reform.
We were getting ready to launch a we-hope-you-realize-
that-if-you-vote-no-this-thing-may-never-pass DART, but
in light of his flip-flop, we filed the pointed edges off several
darts and fashioned them into a we're-glad-you-finally-came-
to-your-senses-and-realized-that-something-is-better-than-
nothing LAUREL for Kucinich for stepping down off his
handmade pedestal and supporting health care reform. It's
not perfect, but it's the only option.
And we're hoping the flip-flopping is contagious. Hank
Skinner, a Texas man accused of killing his wife and her sons,
has been begging for years for the courts to test his DNA
against evidence found at the scene.
But for reasons unfathomable to us, they con-
tinue to refuse. He's set to die next week, and we
hope the courts come to their senses and let the DNA
be tested before his death sentence is carried out.
But for now, we're climbing over the barbed-wire fences and
throwing a how-can-you-pretend-what-you're-doing-isn't-
wrong DART at the Texas legal system for not giving a po-
tentially innocent man the chance to live.
And we have another bone to pick with Texas.
We're wondering what exactly makes it think it has license
to change U.S. history. Earlier this week, the Texas State Board
of Education endorsed teaching history and social studies
with a conservative spin. "Capitalism" would become "free
market," "democratic" would become "constitutional repub-
lic," and they'd make it seem as though the World War II in-
temment of Japanese-Americans wasn't racially motivated.
So we're tearing a page out of one of their proposed bogus
textbooks, folding it into a paper plane and flying a while-
you're-at-it-why-don't-you-add-in-some-unicorns DART at
the Texas education system for trying to make history fit its
agenda. Sure, it's convenient. But how about writing a novel
instead?
That's all for now. Go finish sleeping off your hangovers,
drink lots of fluids, and we'll see you next week.

God given too much credit in sports
e's all-knowing. He's all-loving, and He's all pow-
He's also undefeated.
This weekend, as millions of Americans subject them-
selves to the never-ending Greg Gumbel rumble that is
March Madness, there will be miracles (Dan Werner's UF
career is mercifully over), heartbreaks (getting beaten on
a last-second shot by a 13-seeded team named the Racers)
and circus-like shots that make Chinese gymnasts look like
sorority girls stumbling over their heels and birthday signs
in a drunken midtown excursion.
But the credit for the victories? Leave that to the the Al-
mighty.
What else would you expect from the Divine Hand that
has caught every Super Bowl-winning touchdown, used
His all-seeing eye to pick up that 2-2 slider in the dirt and
put it in the seats or "inspired" TapouT-wearing, testoster-
one-fueled champions to pound their opponent's face into
chuck roast? Heaven help the Vegas bookie who gives God
3-1 odds.
Could you imagine if He got credited for some of sports'
less-than holy moments?
Jim Nantz: "Hey Tiger, how did you end up buried un-
derneath a pile of teenage girls?"
Manwhore -I mean Tiger: "You know Jim, that's the
place God put me."
John Madden: "Coach Mora, what about the playoffs?"
Jim Mora: "Plaayoffs?! Thoust don't talk about the play-
offs in the presence of the Lord. Playoffs?! Thoust kidding
me?! Playoffs?!"
Bob Costas: "Mr. Tyson, how have you managed to
squander all your earnings on half a face tattoo?"
Iron Mike: "The Lawd wurks in mysteewious ways,
Bob."OK, so that last one doesn't sound
that unfathomable.
On top of that, there's a whole ros-
ter full of supreme beings waiting to
get off the bench. Why not put them
in, coach? Buddha hasn't won a slam-
CJ Pruner dunk contest since the Coolidge ad-
letters@alligator org ministration. Lord Xenu is still wait-
ing to take the ball in the ninth inning
at Yankee Stadium. Heck, even Joseph Smith is just hoping
to work a housewives bingo tournament.
On second thought, scratch that -nobody wins in that
scenario.
Furthermore, since when does God get cut so much
slack? Middle-aged husbands get an estrogen beatdown
from their wives for trying to check score updates on their
phones for the Browns-Raiders game (still nothing!) while
shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond. Meanwhile, The Big Guy
gets to watch every game from the 50-yard line while coun-
tries get torn apart by earthquakes, diseases, ravaging in-
nocent people. And Nicolas Cage is still allowed to be in
movies. That's not playing to win the game.
Before a mob carrying torches and pitchforks comes
knocking on my door offering salvation and a slew of
slaughter, understand that I'm not calling anyone's reli-
gious convictions into question. I have not come to spread
pinko commie atheistic drivel. Rather, by sending God to
the showers, we are doing millions of believers a favor by
not cheapening His name. He should be someone a person
looks toward to get through the rough patches, should he
or she choose, not to serve as an ESPN ticker update.
But He's still allowed to hate NASCAR.

No one is qualified to judge
shooting incident except for
investigators
The line from Wednesday's edi-
torial on the Kofi Adu-Brempong
shooting that reads, "We also
question why he was shot in the
jaw rather than a safer location," is
beyond ignorant.
The notion that there is a safe
place to shoot somebody is patent-
ly absurd.
When a weapon is drawn and
fired by police officers, the intent
is not to subdue an individual; it
is to kill.There are more ideal places in
which to target an individual, but
the dynamics of a situation like
that are beyond our comprehen-
sion and therefore beyond com-
ment.
I will not debate whether or not
the use of deadly force is justifiable
in the instance of Adu-Brempong's
shooting.
Neither you nor I am qualified
to make that determination.
Hence, there is a need for fur-
ther investigation from a qualified,
unbiased, independent organiza-
tion.

Guest column
People's voice must be heard on immigration crisis
My parents are Americans. Theyare citizens of this great country,
which they are proud to call home.
They are also immigrants.
My father immigrated to this country from
Mexico in 1972 when he was 18 years old. At
the time, he wanted little more than to provide
for his growing family. My mother, then preg-
nant with my oldest brother, had come over a
few months earlier. Before crossing the border,
my dad was told to squeeze into the spare tire
compartment of a station wagon as they drove
through customs in Tijuana. For more than
an hour, he prayed and thought of his young
wife while he tried not to inhale too much of
the exhaust that was seeping in from the tail
pipe.That night he slept in a country where
dreams come true, in which people from all
over the world are risking death just to live.
The next day, my father went to work at
a plant nursery earning $1.35 an hour. He
worked there for five years. In 1977 he started
working for General Motors where he drove
cars off the assembly line. It was a turning
point in his life: My dad didn't have to hide in
the spare tire compartment anymore.
As a first-generation American born to
Mexican immigrants, I remember reciting the
Pledge of Allegiance every day before class.
It gave me the clarity of something I could
depend on. The words came out of me like a
song, and the rhythm seemed to synchronize
itself with my heartbeat. I was taught to baseJamie Gonzalez the rest of the day on
Speaking Out the simplicity of the
Pledge. I would focus
on the passage, "liber-
ty and justice for all." At the time, it just did not
occur to me that even though anyone could cry
out his or her allegiance to this country some
people would simply never be heard.
Countless communities across the U.S.
are filled with people who have no say. In
Shelbyville, where I live, we are repeatedly
reminded of the plight of immigrant families
who have no confidence in a system they feel
has little use for them.
Weare constantlyreceivingreports of honor
students being told they cannot continue their
higher education because they do not have aSocial Security number. Victims of crime have
come to me and said they are afraid to file a
report after they have been robbed simply be-
cause they fear legal-status scrutiny by police.
We have spoken to children who say they be-
come worried when their parents are coming
home late because they believe their mothers
or fathers have been detained by immigration
authorities.
In order to bring a logical and rational solu-
tion to our immigration crisis, the people must
first be heard. We are students; we are teach-
ers; we are engineers; we are builders; we are
civilians; we are soldiers; we are dreamers;
we are human; and we are here. And we are
marching for America.
Jaime Gonzalez is a community leader.

Chapman's breakout
year solidifies bullpen
* UF TAKES ON MISSISSIPPI
STATE TONIGHT.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
The purple scar slithers from the
inside of Kevin Chapman's elbow to
the top of his forearm.
It is the only proof of the Tommy
John surgery Chapman underwent
in 2008 after tearing a ligament in
his left elbow.
In his return this season, the
southpaw has become No. 6 UF's
best reliever, and he will try to con-
tinue his scoreless streak tonight
when Florida hosts Mississippi State
at 7. The junior has yet to allow a run
in 11 2/3 innings this year.
"He was always a guy that
scouts have coveted," coach Kevin
O'Sullivan said. "It's not like he's
come out of nowhere. I think it was
just a matter of time of 'when is he
going to start reaching his poten-
tial?.'"Chapman has overpowered hit-
ters so far this year, and he estimates
about 90 percent of his pitches have
been fastballs. He can also throw
breaking balls and changeups,
but opponents are hitting just .128
against his mostly one-dimensional
style.
Chapman's heater reached a per-
sonal-best 95 mph Tuesday against
FSU.
"Until they start hitting my fast-
ball, I don't think there's any point
in throwing a different pitch," Chap-
man said.
Chapman likes O'Sullivan's
pitching philosophy more than that
of Pat McMahon, UF's previous
coach. When Chapman was a fresh-
man, McMahon told him to make
batters chase bad pitches with two
strikes.
O'Sullivan, on the other hand,
wants Chapman to challenge hitters,
which means more fastballs.
Chapman's favorite pitch isn't
just overpowering; it also moves
SEE BASE, PAGE 15Harrison uiamona / Aingator s5arT
UF pitcher Kevin Chapman has not allowed a run this season in 11 2/3 innings of work. The Gators will
count on him out of the bullpen in their weekend series against Mississippi State.
Boynton deserves praise for effort
Florida was one of the last teamsin the NCAA Tournament, and
one of the first teams out of it
Thursday.
The stay was short, but after a gut-
wrenching 99-92 loss to BYU in double
overtime, give the Gators this: They
left everything on the court in Oklaho-
ma City in their first tournament ap-
pearance since winning back-to-back
titles in 2006 and 2007.
Chandler Parsons went for 20
points, 10 rebounds and six assists,
Vernon Macklin scored 16 and grabbed
seven boards, and freshman guard
Kenny Boynton turned in one of the
gutsiest performances I have ever seen
by a Florida basketball player.
Boynton dumped in 27 on 5-of-
10 three-point shooting and led the
Gators back from a 13-point deficit
with 9:16 remaining in the game.
The streaky shooter scored 14 pointsH
Kyle Maistri
Kyle Points
kmaistri@alligator orgin a row for UF,
including three
three-pointers in
a row, to cut the
lead to 66-63 with
just less than five
minutes left.
Toward the
end of his incred-
ible run, Boyn-
ton could be seen on the right wing,
hunched over and grabbing his shorts
while the ball was in play.
Scoring 14 points in a row is tiring.
Scoring 14 points in a row while
guarding BYU leading scorer Jimmer
Fredette, who carried the Cougars

Gators in fourth at NCAAs

At the Women's NCAA Swimming and
Diving Championships, the UF women's
swimming and diving team did not waste
any time before taking home gold.
After a strong Thursday morning per-
formance in the preliminary rounds, the
Gators' 200-yard freestyle relay squad of
Shara Stafford, Gemma Spofforth, Stepha-
nie Napier and Sarah Bateman won the first
event of the finals session and gave UF its
first ever national title in the 200-yard free-
style relay. The winning relay time of 1:27.79
set a school record.
UF is in fourth place with 107 points.
They trail California, Georgia and leader
Stanford who is at 142.5 points.
"We had an absolutely great night,"
coach Gregg Troy said. "We put ourselves
in a great position today. This morning, we
came out and swam so good in the first re-
lay, and I think it put a little bit of pressure
on us to perform well, which may have af-
fected Gemma's 200 [individual medley]."
After Spofforth failed to make the A fi-
nal for the 200-yard individual medley, sheswam 1:55.61 in the B final. Although she
finished ninth in the event, she swam the
fourth-best time out of all the swimmers.
"This is exactly what we wanted to do to-
night," Spofforth said. "We wanted to come
in and set the tone this morning. We knew
we needed to be good in the relays and we
started the meet off great. This morning, I
didn't have as great a turn on the final free-
style wall as I wanted to,
but tonight I came out
and had a much better
freestyle leg in the IM
race."
In the final event
Thursday night, the
Gators' 400-yard medley
Try r relay team of Spofforth,
Lindsay Rogers, Jemma
Lowe and Stafford placed third with a time
of 3:31.69, second-fastest in school history.
"Tonight, we returned and swam so well.
Obviously the 200 free relay was a great
way to start the night. Gemma responded
and swam outstanding in the IM. Shara was
also consistent for us all day," Troy said.
"We had great relays and look forward to
racing the rest of the weekend."

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators advance in WNIT with 61-54 win over USF
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a IIigato r org
Faced with a win-or-go-home game in the
Women's National Invitation Tournament,
Florida unleashed a barrage of three-pointers
while barely containing USF's Jessica Lawson
in a 61-54 win.
"It wasn't pretty, but I don't think we ex-
pected it to be pretty. We just expected to pull
it out," UF coach Amanda Butler said.
The Gators opened the game with a 20-6
lead off six three-pointers between Jordan
Jones, Steffi Sorensen and Sharielle Smith.
"Shooting is contagious on our team," So-
rensen said. "[Jones] came out hot and all of
us kind of followed behind her. It just got usoff to a good start. It was a good feeling just
to really dominate those first few minutes so
that you know you're in control."
Center Azania Stewart, who missed five
games at the end of the regular season with a
stress fracture in her left foot, had 15 points in
18 minutes. The sophomore returned to game
after leaving following a scary fall where she
seemingly reaggravated the injury.
"I feel pretty good," she said. "Like coach
says, just rub some dirt on it."
It wasn't the easiest return for Stewart,
who had her hands full -as did the whole
team -with Lawson.
USF's double-double threat scored 26
points and collected 12 rebounds. She made
as many shots, 10, as the rest of her team com-
bined."She's an SEC [-type] post player," Butler
said. "She wasn't ready for her career to end,
and it showed in the way that she played."
She single-handedly brought her team out
of a first-half rut, scoring 11
points in the opening peri-
od. Not even her big num-
bers and the Bulls' 58-37 re-
bounding advantage could
make up for the team's 26.7
shooting percentage.
Leading by eight at the
Sorenson break, UF's shots started
to miss in the second half,
as the Gators made just 3 of 13 from three-
point range. But whenever the team needed
a basket, someone delivered, whether it was
Smith with a three-pointer or Stewart in thepost. Sorensen led the team with 16 points,
Stewart had 15 and Jones added 10. Smith
and Lonnika Thompson chipped in eight and
nine apiece.
After surviving the first-round game, the
Gators will head south to Miami to play their
second straight intrastate rival on Sunday at
2 pm. The Hurricanes defeated Florida Gulf
Coast 70-57 on Thursday night.
THREE TRANSFERRING: A trio of usual
faces was missing from the Gators' bench.
Sophomore Trumae Lucas and freshmen
Christal Caldwell and Tessah Holt were sit-
ting in the stands after decisions to transfer
from Florida.
Lucas saw the most time this season out of
the three, averaging 16.4 minutes per game.

SHIRE ON SATURDAY AT 1
P.M. IN GAINESVILLE.

Since coming to Florida, Ra-
chael Zimmerman has under-
gone enough changes to make
the sophomore's head spin.
Zimmerman arrived in
Gainesville a midfielder, but in
December, UF coach Amanda
O'Leary asked her to switch to
defense, which she graciously
did.
Zimmerman had to work hard
because her weak footwork and
over-aggressiveness had prevent-
ed her from being a defender be-
fore, but after about two months
of adjusting, the next change
happened.
This time her coach asked her
to move to attacker, where she
will be playing most of the game
when Florida hosts New Hamp-
shire on Saturday at 1 p.m in
Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
"Instead of running the whole
midfield, right now I'm going to
focus solely on attack, and learn
the plays, and just try to keepthe game going," Zimmerman
said. "It's been kind of up and
down, trying to keep my head on
straight."After the 22-3 win over Marist
on Wednesday, O'Leary told Zim-
merman she was glad the sopho-
more stayed positive throughoutthe difficult transition, even when
she was making mistakes.
"It means a lot that Mandee
(O'Leary) does have faith in me
, -. .,,PP / ..g tf alRachael Zimmerman will be an attacker when UF plays New Hampshire on Saturday in Gainesville. In
December, she switched from midfield to defense before making the new move to offense.to move me around, but it's also a
little stressful," Zimmerman said.
"Because I was struggling with
confidence, (wondering) why am
I moving all over the place?"
O'Leary said Zimmerman is
dynamic, and she understands
what the team is trying to accom-
plish offensively.
However, Zimmerman saw
her role adjusted once more in
the Gators' 22-3 win over the Red
Foxes because O'Leary added a
new dimension -a series of of-
fensive, defensive and midfield
substitutions.
Before the first face-off of the
match, Zimmerman and fresh-
man attacker Janine Hillier wait-
ed by the substitution box.
Zimmerman entered the game
when UF took control of the
draw, replacing starting defender
Kayla Stolins. For the rest of the
game, the two would alternate
for offense and defense.
Hillier was paired with mid-
fielder Kitty Cullen in the new
system, and the two traded off
after three sets of playing both
ends of the field.
"It's a lot of running," Zim-
merman said. "You have to really
hustle off the field."
Reliever relies mostly on fastball
BASE, from page 14
left-to-right about eight inches. Batters
who catch up to the fastball have trouble
making solid contact because they mis-
judge where the ball will be.
"It's almost like he's got two pitches
in one," O'Sullivan said. "It's not only a
92-to-95-mph fastball, but it moves half
the distance of the plate."
Neither O'Sullivan nor Chapman
blamed the left-hander's injury on bad
form, but he still re-worked his delivery
while rehabbing.
Chapman used to slightly swing his
arm behind his back before his follow-through, and now his motion is more
direct.
"Sometimes an injury like that be-
comes a positive for you because you
have eight, 10 months just to work
on your mechanics,"
O'Sullivan said.
Chapman also said
time away from base-Baseball ball made him more
excited to play.
"They always say you never really
know what you have until you lose it,"
Chapman said. "I lost it for a little bit, so
it really helped me realize how fun this
game is and how much I'm blessed."KYLE, from page 14
ting the ball through the net.
Up until Boynton fouled out with four
minutes remaining in double overtime, he
could only muster four more points after
his 14-point run.
He was spent.
The whole time he was lighting up the
Ford Center over that five minute stretch,
all I could think was, "Take him off of Fre-
dette! He's killing himself out there!"
As admirable of a job as he did guard-
ing BYU's primary ball handler, he didn't
exactly shut him down. No one is capable
of that.
The way Boynton was stroking the
ball, it would have been wise to save his
energy and fouls for the offensive end of
the court, where he may have carried UF
for as long as necessary.
Billy Donovan will take some heat for
failing to draw up a functional last-shotplay at the end of regulation and the first
overtime -and rightfully so -but I
think his biggest mistake was not putting
Ray Shipman, one of their best on-the-ball
defenders, on Fredette, who wore Boyn-
ton out by always keeping his dribble and
eventually drew the call that fouled the
freshman out of the game.
Donovan even had to sit Boynton down
for a few seconds to catch his breath im-
mediately following his last three-pointer
in that incredible run. There's no way he
was best served on the bench in that situa-
tion; he could've been resting on defense.
With the possessed look Boynton had
in his eye the whole game, I'm sure he
would've rather guarded two people than
be taken off Fredette, but it clearly took a
toll on him.
The players tried everything they could
to get a win. I'm just not totally sold that
Donovan did.

Well-rested Florida to host Utah to end regular season
The Gators are coming off their only bye week of the year
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
An extra week off from competition
could be just what No. 5 Florida needed
before preparing to make a run at postsea-
son titles during the Southeastern Confer-
ence and NCAA championships.
When Florida (8-2, 5-1 SEC) plays host
to No. 9 Utah (10-2) tonight on Senior Night
in the O'Connell Center, it will have been
two weeks since the Gators' last competi-
tion, a season-best performance against
North Carolina and Ball State, and the ex-tended rest has made the team hungry to
compete again.
"We're excited to get back out there,
and we obviously have a lot of goals and
we're ready to accomplish them," senior
Rebekah Zaiser said. "It was a good men-
tal break."
While the team had a week off from ac-
tual competition before tonight's regular-
season finale, the gymnasts still practiced
over the break and participated in an in-
trasquad competition last week like they
usually do on Thursdays.
"It kept them in the same mindset ofhaving to perform pressure sets and to
not relax and take that time off gymnas-
tically," UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. "It
was important for them
to have that pressure on
them without actually
Gymnastics having a competition
that week and it allows
their bodies to rest just
enough."
Last year, the team didn't have a bye
week in its schedule. This season the rest
will help the team, with some key contrib-
utors coming back from injuries before theseason started. The break will also help the
freshmen on the squad, who perform more
than half of the team's routines.
"Physically, we're all feeling pretty
good this last week," said Zaiser, who re-
turned this season after breaking her foot
last year. "But I think that mentally it did
us good to have a break, just from pushing
through all of these competitions."
Freshman Marissa King said she thinks
the time off will put the Gators in a stron-
ger frame of mind against Utah, and that
they will be able to come out strong to help
boost their regional qualifying score and
catapult themselves into postseason com-
petition.

Players on the Florida bench look on during the closing seconds of the second overtime in the Gators'
99-92 loss to BYU in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.Donovan said. "I didn't think their
depth was a factor in the first 40
minutes, but as we got to the last 10
minutes and Boynton fouled out,
we were trying to hang on physi-
cally."
Boynton was given the tall order
of guarding Fredette, and chasing
around BYU's top scorer tired out
Boynton, who still had one of his
best offensive games of the season.
Although Boynton kept up
with Fredette fairly well, the junior
guard was as good as advertised
and finished with 37 points on 13-
of-26 shooting.
The unexpected star of the day
was Loyd, who was averaging 4.6
points per game before going off
for 26 points on 7-of-10 shooting
Thursday. He helped BYU take the
lead at the end of the first half by
coming off the bench and scoring
10 straight points.
The Cougars extended their leadid overtime
to as many as 13 points in the sec-
ond half, but the Gators were able
to overcome that deficit before run-
ning out of gas in the second over-
time.
"We had a hard time scor-
ing because of fatigue (in
overtime)."
Billy Donovan
UF men's basketball coach
The loss ends UF's season earli-
er than the team would have liked,
but Donovan said he was pleased
with the way his team competed,
as his players showed no signs of
complacency after getting back to
the NCAA Tournament for the first
time in three years.
"One of the most disappoint-
ing things is your players to walk
off the court feeling like they could
have given more," Donovan said.
"And these guys, I don't think,
could have given any more than
they had physically."
