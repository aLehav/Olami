MARIETTA, Ohio — Voters in one 
Ohio county who show their school pride 
at the polls next month will be asked to cover up with a poncho.
Elections officials in southeast Ohio’s 
Washington County don’t want people coming to polling places wearing shirts or other attire promoting local schools that have hotly contested tax measures on the ballot.
Those who do show up to vote on May 3 in a shirt, hat or other article of clothing with the name or mascot of one of the local schools will be handed a poncho by a poll worker, county elections board director Peggy Byers said. 
School Board President Debbie West 
said she thought the elections board policy “may be going a little too far.”
Campaigning close to polling places is 
prohibited.

n ARTISTS COMPETED FOR 
MORE THAN $20,000 IN PRIZE MONEY.

When he signed the back of 
one of his two-dollar nature pho-
tographs, Gabe Thompson had 
to pause for a second. His hand hovered over the green matting as he thought. 
He was writing the date nu-
merically, so he had to check with his stepfather that April is the fourth month. 
Thompson, 10, was one of the 
artists who sold work at the 42nd annual Santa Fe College Spring Arts Festival, held downtown this past weekend.
The event offered an oppor -
tunity for residents to appreci-ate local art while interacting with friends and neighbors. With more than 120,000 visitors, the event drew more people than a UF football game.
UF music senior Christine 
Shen, who has been going to the festival off and on since child-hood, continued her tradition of 
buying a piece of art from the fes-
tival. 
This year, she found a copper 
stingray.
Shen said she especially en-
joys how the festival brings the community together. She ran into friends, acquaintances and old classmates during the festival. 
Photographer and Gainesville 
resident John Moran said he wants his work to remind people why they love Florida. 
He has been participating in 
art shows since 1998 and is work-ing on a book he described as a SFC art festival

UF won another national cham-
pionship Saturday, taking home 
first place and $100,000 in cash and 
prizes from the National Guard FLW College Fishing National Champion-ship.
Jake Gipson and Matthew Wercin-
ski, who made up one of the two UF teams competing in the tournament, caught 15 fish weighing a total of 41 pounds and 8 ounces. Their catch 
outweighed the second-place team, 
Louisiana State University at Shreve-port, by nearly 5 pounds. 
Dennis Croyle and Travis Gates, 
the other UF team, placed ninth in the championship. For the first two days of the three-
day tournament,  Gipson said they were able to get most of the fish they needed before 9 a.m.
“We were really fortunate to get 
the fish early,” he said.
But before 1 p.m. on the final day, 
Gipson said he and Wercinski were a 
bit worried because they hadn’t had 
any bites. Then Gipson 
caught a fish close to four pounds ,and they were 
back on track to claim 
the title of National Champions. 
Of the $100,000 in prizes, $25,000 
will go to the university, and $50,000 
will go to UF’s bass-fishing club. 
“It’s awesome to go out on top and 
that it was our last college event,” Gipson said.UF reels in fishing winACTIVISM

Bonnie Bernau kept it a secret most of her 
life. Only three friends knew the details. 
This weekend, she let 25 strangers in on 
her secret.
Bernau, 60, was one of eight women who 
shared their experiences with abortion Sat-
urday at the Civic Media Center.
The speakers spoke against the ideology 
that has recently driven state legislatures to consider 18 bills that would limit abortion rights. 
They reasoned that cuts to education and 
a lack of jobs  make it more difficult to raise children, so they should be able to choose when they have children.
They also said they don’t need a reason; 
it’s their bodies.
They told their stories as if they were 
having a conversation with the audience of men, mothers and feminists. The women stood in front of a few lines of chairs. Some used a microphone, but many did not need to.
Bernau, who is a UF employee, told of 
how she filed for divorce after her husband impregnated another woman, only to find out she was pregnant, too. 
“I was shaking, just like I am now,” she 
said.
Whitney Mutch, 31, told her story while 
she held her 7-week-old son, Elliott.
When she got pregnant, she was a 
23-year-old graduate student. She said she Women share experiences 
in support of abortion rights

Deer, goose make unlikely 
pair in Buffalo cemetery
BUFFALO, N.Y . — An unusual 
springtime friendship between 
a deer and a nesting goose ap-pears to have blossomed inside a cemetery in Buffalo, N.Y . For 
the past week or so, the deer has 
been standing near an urn where the goose has taken up residence, positioning itself between the urn and any passing car or foot traffic.
Craig Cygan noticed the un-
likely pair during his regular pa-trols with his goose-chasing border collies. He says there is no mate 
around the goose, and he believes 
the deer has taken over the job of protecting the nest.
Cornell University wildlife 
expert Paul Curtis says deer and geese usually don’t pay any atten-tion to each other.
Forest Lawn Cemetery officials 
are trying to arrange for a webcam 
so the curious can check in on the 
nest.

Grooveshark, the local startup 
music website that became one of 
Time Magazine’s top 50 sites of 2010, went back to its roots Sat-urday when it hosted its first of-
ficial Battle of the Bands at the Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza.
About 150 people came out to 
the free event, which was spon-sored by UF Student Government, 
Florida Blue Key and the City of 
Gainesville, to drink, dance and discover new music. 
The event raised more than 
$1,000 in donations for the Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County.
“It’s cool to see the Boys & 
Girls Club getting involved with a 
company like Grooveshark,” said 
Keith Blanchard, CEO of the coun-ty branch. “All the money is going to a great cause.”
Before any bands took the stage, 
City Commissioner Jeanna Mas-trodicasa read aloud a proclama-tion written by Mayor Craig Lowe  naming Saturday a citywide Boys & Girls Club Day.
Levek, the first band to per -
form, used a 
wide variety of instruments, in-cluding ukeleles, pan flutes, key-
boards, guitars 
and lots of per -
cussion, while Waylon Thorn-
ton and the Heavy Hands got peo-
ple dancing to their stripped-down 
brand of southern blues rock.As twilight fell, Plastic Plastic 
entertained the audience with their experimental brand of sound.
Kadets, a pop-punk group, 
switched things up with their em-phasis on uptempo rhythms and 
catchy choruses.  
J2K topped off the night with 
their funky and atmospheric jam-
ming.
Bailey Williams, 25, said her 
favorite performance of the night was from Levek because of the sheer variety of talent among the seven members.
“I feel like that’s a different lev-
el of music,” she said.
In the end, Plastic Plastic won 
over the judges. 
Their first-place finish came 
with a free promotional deal from Grooveshark and bragging rights 
as the first champions.
“It feels good,” said Andrew 
Simler, a guitarist for the group. 
“But, more importantly, I’m happy we got to play at an amazing com -
munity event, for a great cause.”Battle of the Bands raises more than $1,000 for charity
was on birth control at the time, but 
two pink lines appeared on her preg-nancy test.
She said she and her fiance weren’t 
ready to be parents.
“I had the support of my partner, 
but it was still the most terrifying, lonely experience,” said Mutch, a UF alumna.
After three days of waiting for an 
appointment, she walked past pro-life protesters into an abortion clinic. She got the abortion pills and went home.
Now, she’s the mother of two chil-
dren, and she said her decision to have an abortion was the right choice because she was not able to support a 
child at that time. 
She said if she’d been forced to 
have a child when she was 23, she 
probably wouldn’t have had any more children.
“I wouldn’t have my two kids,” 
she said in an interview. “I don’t know what my life would’ve been like because it would’ve completely 
changed the trajectory of my life.”Eight women spoke at the rally
ABORTION , from page 1There were 200 artists in the show
“400-page love letter to Florida.”
“My job is to be amazed,” he said.
The artists competed not only for sales 
but also for more than $20,000 in prize 
money and a spot for one piece to be dis-
played at Santa Fe College. 
Two jurors, one for 2-D art and one for 
3-D art, chose a “Best of Show” winner for each category. 
Painter Susan Dauphinee and ceramic 
artist Tim Ludwig won the top awards this year. They received $3,000 in cash, 
and each will have one of their works put 
on display.
Coordinator Kathryn Lehman said 
more than 700 artists applied for 200 spots to be in this year’s festival. The college is not planning to expand the show. 
Santa Fe College President Jackson 
Sasser said the quality of the art is more 
important than the size of the festival. 
He also said he wants it to accommo-
date visitors from a wide range of finan-
cial backgrounds with a wide variety of 
tastes.
He said it’s uncommon 
for someone to be able to go to a football game and then 
walk to an arts festival where they run 
into friends doing the same thing. Sass-
er said this fact highlights the festival’s prominence in the community and the uniqueness of the community itself.
“That’s Gainesville,” he said.SANTA FE , from page 1

—  KAT BEINn KRISHNA LUNCH IS LOCALLY 
GROWN AND “KARMA-FREE.”
  By RACHEL STEPHENS
 Alligator Contributing Writer
   The chiming of tiny hand cymbals 
and chanting of the Hare Krishnas ﬁ  ll the Plaza of the Americas at lunchtime during the week.
  The Hare Krishnas serve 700 to 1,000 
plates of vegetarian food each day at $4 a plate, according to A. Ashkuff, senior ambassador for the UF Multicultural and Diversity Affairs Religious Diver-sity Committee.
  In order to explain the spiritual im-
plications and history behind this plaza lunch, Krishna Demonstration was put on by the UF Multicultural and Diver-sity Affairs at the Reitz Union on Fri-day night.
  In the ﬁ  rst event of its kind on cam-
pus, about 20 people participated in a guided discussion with the Hare Krish-nas and sampled free food.
  Former UF student Charles Morris,  
23, who attended the demonstration, said he used to eat Krishna Lunch be-
cause it was a cheap and delicious.
  “I think it’s really cool because it ex-
poses you to another culture on a daily 
basis in a very mundane way,” he said. 
  But Morris said he knew little about 
the background of the more than 30-year-old Krishna Lunch tradition 
until he came to the demonstration.
  He and the other participants ﬁ  rst 
watched a short documentary ﬁ  lmed 
by Ashkuff. 
  The ﬁ  lm explained that Krishna 
Lunch is served to Lord Krishna before 
it is served in front of Li-
brary West. After Krishna 
eats his share, the food 
becomes “karma-free” 
and is given to people. 
  Andres Salim, a 23-year-old UF stu-
dent and resident at the Krishna house, 
explained to the group what it means 
to be “karma-free.” When someone 
does something bad, he or she should 
expect a bad reaction, Salim said. When something good is done, a good reac-
tion should be expected.
  But Hare Krishnas serve food as an 
act of worship for Lord Krishna, which eliminates karma from this action.
  “When you do things for God, 
it transcends the idea of right and 
wrong,” Salim said. 
  Then Salim clariﬁ  ed the meaning 
behind the chants that are sung during Krishna Lunch. 
  The song has only three words, 
“Hare,” “Krishna” and “Rama,” he said. These are all different names for their god, and chanting the names is an act of worship.
  The audience was able to join the 
chant along with the Hare Krishnas as they played the traditional Indian cymbals called kartals, a drum called a Balarama and an accordion keyboard instrument called a harmonium. 
  Salim also said that the food used in 
Krishna Lunch is locally grown. Some is grown at the Krishna House, locat-ed just behind Krispy Kreme on 13th Street.
  The food is always vegetarian be-
cause the Hare Krishnas don’t believe in hurting other animals. There is also never garlic, onions or mushrooms in the food because these ingredients have bad karma, Salim said.  Krishnas share lunchtime traditions

He could have been an indus-
trial engineer. Like his father, he 
could have worked for NASA.
Instead, Marlow Gates sits in 
the shade of his tent at the Santa Fe College Spring Arts Festival, wrapping twine around the end of a broom handle with a grin on 
his face.
Like his father, he’d rather be 
doing this.
At the head, most of his brooms 
look like any other. They’re dry, straw-looking strands that bunch 
together at the base. 
Those handles earn him labels 
at festivals such as “That guy 
with the crazy brooms” or  “the 
broom man.”
The thing he’s now got his 
hands on is a length of poplar branch with honeysuckle vine 
spiraled around it, shining with 
lacquer. 
It’s beginning to look like 
something  found in the corner of 
a wizard’s living room.
This, he says, is one of his more 
normal prototypes. Among the 
menagerie of broom handles lin-ing the walls of his tent are some 
made with deer antlers. Others 
are fitted with a knot of roots for the handle. 
His family’s best-known cre-
ation, the double- and triple-headed broom, earned his father a picture in National Geograph-
ic.
“Wood is like people,” Gates 
said. “The more it goes through 
in life, the more interesting it is. It just cannot be plain.”The same could be said of 
Gates’ family.
In 1974, with a job at NASA  
and four children at home, Gates’ father, Ralph, decided to quit his job to take an apprenticeship with an Appalachian broommaker.
He packed up his family and 
struck out for Gatlinburg, Tenn. There, he would undergo a year of unpaid learning.
Gates, who was a few months 
old at the time of the move, grew up weaving brooms. Now 38, he’s a font of information for all things relating to the broom.
Ask him about his technique, 
and he issues an oral dissertation about the Shaker method, which dates back to the 1790s, of using a grain called broomcorn for the 
heads. 
After his father’s death in 
2004, he said he noticed a change 
in the brooms he made.
Gates said his father was prone 
to making brooms with all black handles and white bristles or with cow jawbones for handles.
Unlike his father’s brooms, his 
were less wild.
Gates said he still keeps his 
brooms interesting. One of his double brooms, the wedding 
broom, has two sections of bris-
tles that appear to be holding hands. He got the idea after he — he couldn’t resist it — “jumped the broomstick.”
A standard broom of his takes 
about six hours to make. The more complex double or triple brooms can take up to 35 hours 
to make.
Those long hours, he said, are 
why he can sell his brooms for more than the ones you might find in Walmart. 
They usually go from any-
where between $28 for a smaller 
one to $1,200 for his more intri-
cate models.
He makes them for three uses. 
The knee-high brooms are for 
sweeping and adorning hearths. The thicker, midsized brooms are 
for floors. 
For getting cobwebs, he makes 
long, skinny brooms, sometimes 
out of cane pole fishing rods.
Most of his ideas, he says, are 
inspired by the wood he finds around his house in the Appala-chians in Leicester, N.C.
Around December, when the 
sap is low in the trees and the leaves are gone, he and his wife head into the mountain woods to collect handles. 
He usually finds his future 
creations under power lines or driftwood at the beach.
The rest of the year, he hauls 
those broom handles around the 
Southeast in his Dodge Ram van 
to different festivals. The inside of the packed vehicle smells like hay and lacquer.
Friday afternoon, he could 
be found unloading his van and piecing together his tent behind SunTrust bank on Northeast First Avenue. 
By Saturday morning, he’s at 
work in his collapsible lawn chair under the shade of the tent, tug-ging at the twine that holds his 
brooms together. 
The twine runs between his 
legs down to a spool he turns 
with his tattered white tennis shoes.He gazes down at the broom 
through his half-inch-thick glass-es as he knots the twine with 
same sailor’s knot his dad taught 
him.
A little girl runs under the tent 
out of the heat of the day for a 
closer look at his brooms. Her eyes widen as she looks 
the handles up and down.
“These brooms are cool!” she 
shouts, then dashes out of the 
tent.
Gates grins down at the knot 
he’s working on.
He’d rather be doing this.MONDAY, APRIL 11, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Today’s question: Have you ever 
gone fishing?
83 TOTAL VOTES39% YES61% NOFriday’s question: Are you going to the Orange and Blue Debut?Government crisis averted for now
It was 11:59 p.m., and only one minute remained until the U.S. federal government was set to shut down.
This was the situation that confronted our nation on 
Friday.
Fortunately for those depending on governmental 
resources, especially for our military, a shutdown was avoided for at least another week.
More importantly, for the nation as a whole, many 
of the larger substantive issues that prompted our current fiscal crises have been brought to light dur -
ing the current debate over governmental funding. 
While many Americans seem to be getting the message 
that our government cannot continue to borrow and 
spend money at will, many of these same people do not seem willing to bear the hardships these cuts inevitably engender.
Our own state provides a telling example of this. Rick 
Scott ran for governor on a platform of cutting excess waste from the state’s budget, lowering the state deficit and keeping taxes low for all Floridians. Setting aside the governor’s past business indiscretions and personal prob-lems, one fact is certain. Now that he is in office, Gov. Scott is fulfilling many of the promises he made on the cam-paign trail. This seems to surprise and upset many, which in itself is revealing about our current political culture. However, this is a new reality we all must face. Budget cuts must be made. Any rational person can look at the current spending habits of our federal government and many of our state governments and know they cannot continue.
However, politicians, afraid of the backlash that in-
evitably will arise from making these cuts, are hesitant to make the changes. This is why we, as citizens, must show our support for deep budget cuts that will place us on a path to a more stable financial future. Right now, much of our federal 
discretionary spending goes toward funding social entitlement pro-grams. It certainly is not popular to rework funding for these programs, but it must be done. No college-aged individual would see social security if the program continues in its pres-ent form. Every generation of Amer -
icans has been called upon to sacrifice for the greater good of its country, and this  crisis is no different. It will require 
all Americans to sacrifice. While this is not a politically 
popular position, it is a realistic one. 
In the upcoming months and years, it also would be 
beneficial to engage in a discussion of how to distribute 
the tax burden among our citizens more fairly and equally. 
Would it be fair to redistribute wealth from the rich to the 
poor simply because the former have been more success -
ful? No. Would it be fair to adopt a flat tax where every-
one pays a fixed percentage of their income? No. Would it be fair to require everyone to pay taxes in proportion to the services provided to them and the goods they re-ceive? Yes. Not only would this system further more ef-fective and efficient market allocation of resources, but it also would comport with modern notions of fundamen-tal fairness. A person would be taxed on how much he or she spends rather than on how much he or she earns. All Americans must take these considerations seriously. As a nation, we are facing a financial crisis unseen in mod -
ern times. Unless we begin to reform now, there will be a time when it is 11:59 p.m., and a permanent crisis cannot be averted. 
Zack Smith is a first-year law student. His columns appear 
on Mondays.Students who have a few years until graduation may 
want to get used to the idea of hot Gainesville sum-mers. 
In a climate that favors streamlining a UF student’s ed-
ucation and cutting university costs, mandatory summer classes may become the standard. 
Most of us are exempt from taking the required classes 
now because of credits we earned in high school, but a change to legislation may keep us hanging around town or tethered to our computers during summer.
It sounds off-putting at first, we admit. However, stu-
dents should keep in mind that the changes would require 
some students — most likely those with core classes avail-
able during summer — to take spring and summer classes, leaving fall open for internships, research, vacations and other typical summer activities. 
Would it be a big shift for some of us? Yes, but only because we’ve been engrained with ideas 
about summer since we first set foot in our kindergarten classroom. 
From day one, we learned it was a time for dodging 
schoolwork unless you were catching up or getting ahead of the game. 
We simply don’t see a problem with shifting that break 
to the fall.
The new requirement would help increase enrollment 
at the university, which currently admits only 22 percent of students who apply for the fall. 
It also would help cut summer costs by ensuring more 
income flows into the university from May through Au-
gust while keeping costs relatively level.
For the financially minded students, there’s also  legis-
lation seeking to amend Bright Futures to allow it to pay 
for the spring-summer plan. The plan would remove a fi-
nancial burden from students switching to the new sched-
ule. 
Even with this effort to make the transition as painless 
as possible, we’re sure UF would be awash with com-plaints for the first year of the proposed change. 
In fact, we’re expecting some complaints about this edi-
torial alone. 
We understand that, at first, students would be con-
fused about when to take internships or how to approach 
leases with their apartment complexes, given such a 
strange schedule. 
But, as with nearly any change, they would adapt. For those of you who still are cynical about the possibil-
ity, we’ll give you a nod. 
Yes, we understand our university operates as a busi-
ness. 
It needs to be as efficient as possible, and that goal often 
conflicts with the wishes of the faculty, staff and students. 
Sometimes, efficiency even takes priority over our edu-
cational needs, making us question the machinations of our university administration and state legislature. 
In this case, however, we don’t see many downsides to 
summer courses. 
You know, except for living in the middle of a swamp in 
the midst of a Florida summer or zoning out during online lectures.Summer School

Grads who don’t have a job 
lined up shouldn’t be discour-
aged.
More jobs are becoming 
available; you just have to be creative about finding them. 
Adrienne Wells, assistant di-
rector for experiential education at the Career Resource Center, said “A lot of people are hiring, but not the places where you think to look.”
Wells encourages students to 
look across the board at compa-nies and industries they hadn’t considered. 
Major doesn’t equal career, 
she said. Students should focus more on what they want to do and what skills they acquired from experience, and decide what careers open up based on these factors. 
According to a recent ar-
ticle by the National Associa-tion of Colleges and Employers (NACE), the graduating class of 2011 can expect to see a 13.5% increase in hiring. 
The Job Outlook 2011 Fall 
Preview survey was conducted among NACE members and predicted this increase based on employers’ answers.
This expected increase is a 
positive forecast for those stu-
dents graduating in the spring. 
 “Be open. Be flexible. Think 
outside the box,” said Adrienne Wells, assistant director for ex-
periential education at the Ca-
reer Resource Center.

So, you were offered the position you 
wanted, but not the salary you were look-
ing for. Where do you go from here? 
Unfortunately, salary negotiation is 
an often overlooked matter and gets lost in the excitement of the job search. You should be prepared to enter into salary negotiations should you need to. 
Plan ahead and do research. The Career Resource Center makes 
this process easier by offering you free tools such as the NACE Salary Calcula-tor. 
With this tool you are able to fill out 
information about your experience, ed-ucation and the area you want to work in. The calculator is then able to come up with figures of average salaries paid to individuals holding those positions in the area you requested. To find the calculator visit www.crc.
ufl.edu, click on “Students” and click on “Salary Negotiation” under “Search for a Position.”
This is a good starting place for re-
searching what you’re worth as a can-didate. 
Other tools available online. Research 
what individuals in similar positions are making in the area you want to work.
Also, create a budget that details your 
expected costs of living. You should be sure you can live off of the salary being offered to you.
Research will allow you to present 
your employer with a reasonable, well-prepared counter-offer.

So you’re searching for a job? 
Fantastic. Do you have practi-
cal expectations for your work hours?
Students in several fields at the 
University of Florida have an un-realistic expectation of work-life balance, according to employers who attended the Career Resource Center’s Career Showcase.
Recruiters from industries like 
engineering, sales and retail, management and accounting said students did not have realis-tic work schedule expectations. 
These industries typically work 
beyond a usual 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. workday.Melissa Ortiz, a recent UF grad 
and Geico SLP Management In-tern said her transition to full-time work was significant.
“The nature of my job includes 
rotations through departments that don’t guarantee my usual [8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.] schedule,” Or-tiz said. 
Ortiz said that flexibility and 
learning to adapt to alternative work schedules helped her suc-ceed. In addition, time manage-ment, utilizing proper resources to help complete tasks and del-egating tasks to others when nec-essary aided in her success.
“The more I get done during 
the day, the less I have to worry about in the evenings and on the weekends,” she said.
WebMD recommends that stu-
dents begin by determining what matters most to them. Students should next drop unnecessary ac-tivities, allocate time to their pri-vate accomplishments and rela-tionships, and develop a healthy balance between work and per-sonal life, according to the Web-site.
“It’s about working smarter, 
not harder,” Ortiz said.
Students may schedule a one-
on-one appointment at the Ca-reer Resource Center for addi-tional aid with career planning.

sistance finding a job or intern-ships, we are here to help. Call us at 352-392-1601, visit us on the first floor of the Reitz Union or online at www.crc.ufl.edu.

help you after graduation?
Once you are an ofﬁ  cial 
alumnus of UF, you’re still able to utilize our services. 
Maybe you don’t yet have 
a job lined up after gradua-tion or perhaps you’ll be look-ing for a new position in a few years, don’t forget the CRC is still a great resource for all job searching and advising.
One-on-one-services, e.g. 
advising, counseling and re-sume critiques, are available for the ﬁ  rst year after gradua-tion.
Our other services, Gator 
CareerLink, e-career planning and career fairs, like Career Showcase are available to all alumni. 
“Employers are open to all 
forms of candidates,” said An-gel Iverson, assistant director for career events, “they perk up when they realize alumni are able to attend career fairs.”
According to Iverson, alumni 
also value career fairs, during Spring 2011 Career Showcase, alumni drove to Gainesville from as far as Kentucky.

  UF journalism major Bridget Higginbotham will 
join her peers on April 30 as she marches on stage, 
receives her diploma and ends her career as a college student.
  As of now she does not have a lead on any jobs or 
internships and may have to return to her home in Or-lando before moving on to her future career. But that could be changing within the next few months.
  According to a survey from the National Associa-
tion of Colleges and Employers, there is a projection of a 13.5 percent increase in the amount of job and internship hiring by employers for this coming fall. Last year 197 employer members of the National As-sociation of Colleges and Employers participated in the Job Outlook 2011 Fall Preview Survey between July 26, 2010 and August 27, 2010. 
  The increase will affect all majors throughout the 
country. In a list of the top degrees in demand, ac-counting tops it with a 61.6 percent of total respon-dents who will hire this year. The degrees on the list include majors in engineering, science, ﬁ  nance, math, business, economics and logistics. 
  Just a couple of years ago in 2009, the same sur-
vey came out with results of negative 21.6 percent hiring projections. The job market is improving mainly because the economy is improving and employers are able to hire more college graduates. 
  The average salary is also predicted to see an in-
crease of ﬁ  ve percent this year, according to the Na-tional Association of Colleges and Employers Salary Survey.   Hiring Increase Beneﬁ  ts UF Grads12, ALLIGATOR, SPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION  n MONDAY, APRIL 11, 2011

aberry@alligator.org
After a spring full of closed prac-
tices, Saturday’s Orange and Blue 
Debut was slated to be the Gators’ 
first chance to show how far they 
progressed under coach Will Mus-
champ.
While Muschamp and his play-
ers emphasized that they viewed the spring game as simply another 
practice, an announced crowd of 
53,000 filed into Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium hoping to watch John Brant-
ley’s emergence as a prototypical pocket passer, to see what a pro-
style Gators offense looked like and to witness the dawn of a new era of 
Florida football.
But, due largely to injuries, fans 
observed a game that did little to 
showcase what the 2011 Gators will 
eventually resemble. 
Both defenses had their way 
against decimated offensive lines 
and backfields in an intrasquad scrimmage that featured only two touchdowns, as the Blue team beat the Orange team 13-10.
“We’ve had a lot of moving parts up front, which is good for our foot-ball team in that we’re building depth and we’ve had to cross-train guys at different positions, and I think that will help us in the long run,” Muschamp said. “But in the short run, it’s been a little frustrat-ing.”
The offensive line was so banged 
up coming into the game that last 
week Muschamp joked he would have to play left tackle, and the lack 
of depth was apparent under the Saturday afternoon sun, as both de-
fensive lines had little trouble get-ting to the quarterback.
Brantley stated earlier this spring 
that he feels comfortable in offensive coordinator Charlie Weis’ system, but the defense’s pressure was too 
much for him to overcome Satur -
day. The senior played one half and 
threw for 45 yards and no touch-
downs on 4-of-14 passing.
“He’s got to have better people 
around him, and that starts with our offensive line,” Muschamp said. 
“There’s been some spotty work 
with that up front because of inju-
ries, because we were thin to begin 
with.”
The starting defensive line — 
particularly the sophomore trio of Sharrif Floyd, Dominique Easley 
and Ronald Powell — made life es-
pecially difficult for Brantley .

line of scrimmage, forcing Brantley

Florida senior quarterback John Brantley throws a pass during the Orange and Blue Debut at the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Brantley finished 4 of 14 for 45 yards and no touchdowns.
Injuries create stagnant offense in spring scrimmage
Will Muschamp said on the first 
day of spring practice that Flor -
ida’s preliminary depth chart 
was worth as much as the sheet of paper it was printed on. Three weeks later, the value has not gone up — at least not for the quarterbacks. 
“If we started the season today, John 
Brantley would be our starter,” Muschamp said after Saturday’s spring game.
Based on the tiny sliver the team 
showed, you should be happy the season 
isn’t starting today. Despite the hype about 
a new offense being a natural fit for Brant-ley, the end result looked eerily similar to the team’s 2010 performance. 
Muschamp said Brantley completed 
almost 70 percent of his passes during practices this spring, but in the first half Saturday, the only time we could see him, Brantley completed just 4 of 14 passes for 
45 yards. 
Several players said after the game the 
passing attack did not look much different 
than it had during closed practices, and not everyone is sold on Brantley starting next year.
“Tyler Murphy, I 
like him the best,” re-ceiver Robert Clark said. “He came a 
long way. Last year, 
he was pretty good, but I guess he wasn’t as comfortable. This 
year, he stepped up a lot.”
Murphy was barely better than Brantley 
on Saturday, finishing 7 of 11 for 68 yards, a touchdown and an interception. 
But he was better, making the quar -
terback competition more muddled than Muschamp indicated.
Granted, this was not an actual game; it 
was simply a scrimmage with fans watch-ing. Perhaps we just caught Brantley on a 
bad day, but based on everything we have 
seen in the past year, there is no reason for Brantley still listed as starter, 
but no QBs standing out for UF

Florida sophomore Erik Murphy and 
freshman Cody Larson were arrested 
early Sunday morning on third-degree felony burglary charges, according to the St. John’s County Sheriff’s Office.  
The two were taken into custody in St. 
Augustine at approximately 4 a.m. and were later released on $5,000 bond. 
According to News4Jax.com, Murphy , 
20, and Larson, 19, broke into a car out-side Scarlett O’Hara’s Bar and Restaurant after claiming to have lost a wallet. 
Larson and Murphy were reportedly 
trying to get close to a worker counting 
money before a bouncer asked them to 
leave. The victim, an employee of the bar, did not notice any missing items, accord-ing to St. Augustine Police. 
Joshua Adel, a team manager, is also 
charged with principal to burglary, ac-
cording to News4Jax.com.
Larson is amid a two-year probation 
period following a misdemeanor drug 
charge in his home-
town of Sioux Falls, S.D. He was sentenced in May for sharing Hy-drocodone pills with a Roosevelt High team-
mate and inhabiting 
a room where drugs 
were stored and used. 
Larson redshirted this season, while 
Murphy averaged 4.3 points and 2.3 re-bounds in 10.8 minutes per game as a sophomore.

UF SOFTBALL

With an assist from teammate 
Aja Paculba, Megan Bush didn’t 
need long to rewrite the record books. 
After tying former Gator Fran-
cesca Enea’s Southeastern Confer -
ence career home run record in Saturday’s 8-1 win against Arkan-sas, Bush cemented her place in league history with her 62nd long-ball as No. 10 Florida (33-7, 10-6 SEC) completed the sweep with an 8-0 shutout against Arkansas (10-32, 1-18 SEC). Without any bats to her liking 
Sunday, Bush borrowed Paculba’s. And the shared bat worked equal-ly well for both. 
Paculba homered to left in the 
first inning before Bush crushed her record-breaking shot to lead off the third. 
“It feels good now that it’s com-
pletely lifted off my shoulders,” 
Bush said. “It’s fun to leave here 
knowing I did something and that I can step up and play with some of the great players that have been 
in our program.” 
Bush’s fellow seniors, who saw 
Enea break the record last year, couldn’t have been any happier 
to see a clubhouse favorite set the new mark. 
“Megan’s one of my best friends 
and a hard worker,” left fielder 
Kelsey Bruder 
said. “I’m so ex-cited for the re-cord to be hers 
now.”
Along with 
Bush and Pac-
ulba, the Gators’ lineup flexed its 
muscle with a three-run homer by 
shortstop Cheyenne Coyle and a 
game-ending shot by Bruder.With catcher Tiffany DeFelice 
turning over the lineup and UF’s Nos. 1-5 hitters providing the punch, the offense scored 20 runs in the three-game sweep after scoring only 23 during its six-game losing streak coming into the weekend. 
They stranded six runners the 
first two innings, but the Gators improved and capitalized on run-scoring opportunities the rest of the way. 
“It’s really important to not 
get caught up in, ‘What I’ve done wrong,’” UF coach Tim Walton said. “They give you three outs for a reason. It’s important to use them all.” 
Lost amid Bush’s historic day 
was a bounce-back performance by Hannah Rogers. 
After dropping four straight 
starts, the freshman picked up three wins this weekend, highlighted by Sunday’s two-hit shutout. 
The freshman righty pitched six 
innings and stuck out seven bat-ters en route to her 19th win. 
“She got better as the game 
went along,” Walton said. “She did a good job hammering her pitches that were working, whether they were their weaknesses or their strengths.”

n THE RIGHT-HANDER CLOSED THE 
GATORS’ 3-1 WIN ON SUNDAY.

Last Tuesday , Florida coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan expressed his overriding confi-
dence in pseudo-closer Anthony DeSclafani.
But when the junior struggled in the ninth 
inning again Sunday , O’Sullivan turned to another hard-throwing righty he has also ex-
pressed faith in all year. 
Despite entering the most precarious situ-
ation of his young career, Austin Maddox es-caped a bases-loaded jam behind two defen-sive gems, securing No. 4 UF a 3-1 win over 
Mississippi State in Starkville. In the ninth, the Bulldogs (21-11, 5-7 South-
eastern Conference) were down by two runs 
but loaded the bases on a pair of singles and a 
pivotal error by DeSclafani. 
With one out, the junior had a chance to 
end the game on a weak comebacker, but DeS-clafani turned to start a double play and threw 
the ball into center field. 
Maddox, who wasn’t even warming up, 
was summoned from the dugout and charged with closing the game for the Gators in front of a raucous crowd of 6,453. 
 “When we handed the ball to Maddox, he 
said, ‘I got this thing, coach,’” O’Sullivan said.
Making just the eighth appearance of his 
career, the sophomore pitched the Gators (26-7, 9-3 SEC) to a series victory thanks to two outstanding defensive plays. 
With one out, Kamm Washington, inserted 
as a defensive replacement in right field when the inning started, made a diving catch and hustled the ball back into the infield. 
The very next batter, C.T. Bradford, popped 
a pitch a mile high into foul territory , but UF third baseman Zack Powers sprinted toward the screen and made a running catch near the 
dugout to end the game. 
“Unbelievable play by 
Powers there at the end to 
seal the win,” O’Sullivan 
said. 
Freshman Karsten Whit-
son made his eighth start of 
the year for Florida, tossing 5.1 innings with three strikeouts. The right-hander mixed his 
pitches well and located his sliders and chan-
geups better than he has all season. 
“That might have been his best outing of 
the year,” O’Sullivan said.
With the game tied in the fifth, Whitson showed his developing maturity as he es-caped a first-and-third, one-out situation by inducing a double-play groundout to end the 
frame. 
UF broke the 1-1 tie in the seventh on a 
single by Preston Tucker. The two-out rally started with a base hit from Powers. 
After Nolan Fontana walked and Josh Ad-
ams hit a dribbler to load the bases, Tucker bounced a single up the middle, plating two 
runs.
The Gators mustered nine hits on the after -
noon after smashing the Bulldogs for 18 hits and runs in Saturday’s blowout victory.
“To come back after losing Friday night and 
then to win yesterday and not get complacent and try to get the series win was awfully im-portant,” O’Sullivan said. “If you want to win championships in this league, you have to go 
on the road and take care of business.”Maddox, defense help UF take series against MSU

After not seeing as much playing time as they would 
have liked in their freshman seasons, Dominique Easley, 
Ronald Powell and Sharrif Floyd were humbled.
“When you come from being leaders on your team and 
being the stars from where you’re from and stuff like that, and you get sat down, it’s kind of frustrating,” Powell said. 
The highly touted 2010 recruits combined for just 52 
tackles and one sack last season. But they made the most 
of their time on the field Saturday in the Orange and Blue 
Debut.
Despite not racking up gaudy statistics, the trio forced 
their way into the face of Florida’s quarterbacks through-
out the scrimmage. They limited John Brantley to just four 
completions and 45 passing yards.
“We can be one hell of a force if we really, really come 
together,” Floyd said before clarifying himself. “We will 
be.”
The defense didn’t reveal much of its playbook in the 
scrimmage. Powell noted that he didn’t even get to play 
in his new spot, the “Buck” position, because the unit pre-
sented such a vanilla look.
Floyd led both teams with four tackles, while Powell 
finished the day with one pass breakup. Easley did not re-cord any stats Saturday, but he was in the backfield most 
of the day. 
“It’s fun, man,” Powell said of playing with Floyd and 
Easley. “You got a lot of competition. If you don’t get to the 
ball before they do, it’s a wrap.”
INJURY REPORT: Freshman wide receiver Javares McRoy 
missed the scrimmage because of a medical procedure on his 
lung, according to coach Will Muschamp. 
McRoy has been out a week and a half, but Muschamp 
made it clear McRoy’s health problem will not be a long-term issue.
“He’s fine,” Muschamp said. “There’s no serious situa-
tion right here.”
Versatile sophomore Trey Burton and wide receiver An-
dre Debose were also kept on the sideline Saturday. Both 
missed the scrimmage because of ankle injuries they suf-
fered during spring practice.Muschamp said Burton could have played if it was the 
regular season, but he decided to sit him out for precau-
tionary reasons. 
Florida’s new coach didn’t sound so encouraged by De-
bose’s injury, though. Debose admitted to having trouble picking up last season’s offense, so it was critical for him to 
spend as much time on the field as possible to understand 
offensive coordinator Charlie Weis’ system.
“I’m disappointed that Andre Debose hurt his ankle,” 
Muschamp said. “I wish we could have gotten some more reps with him. … He’s a guy that really had a good offsea-
son and was having a good spring up to that point.”20, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, APRIL 11, 2011

Redshirt freshman quarterback Tyler Murphy throws a pass during the Orange and Blue Debut at Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday. Murphy threw for 68 yards and a touchdown on 7-of-11 passing.
Conservative playcalling adds to struggles in passing, running game
to rush throws. The trio easily batted 
down several passes.
While Saturday’s performance 
will cause many to question Brant-
ley’s role as the front-runner for the 
starting job in the fall, Floyd was 
quick to come to a different conclu-
sion.
“I wouldn’t call John Brantley’s 
play today a struggle. I would call it, ‘Not enough room,’” Floyd said. 
“Me and Dominique Easley col-
lapsed the pocket, and that’s one of 
our main goals. We forced offensive 
linemen into his face. … That’s just 
how our D-line plays.”
The ground game was equally 
stagnant, as Chris Rainey was the 
only scholarship running back avail-able, resulting in 5-foot-9, 172-pound 
Malcolm Jones, a walk-on listed as a 
defensive back, to carry the ball 15 
times on the day.
After both offenses sputtered 
through a scoreless first quarter, 
kicker Caleb Sturgis hit three field 
goals of 21, 43 and 33 yards to put 
the Blue team ahead 6-3.
The game’s only touchdowns 
came in the fourth quarter — one a 10-yard connection between back-
up quarterback Tyler Murphy and 
walk-on running back Ben Sams for 
the Orange team, the other a 39-yard pass from walk-on Christian Pro-
vancha to receiver Robert Clark for the Blue team.
While injuries certainly limited 
the Gators offensively , Clark said 
the coaches were also responsible 
for UF’s lack of offensive panache, using what he estimated to be 30 
percent of their new playbook — 
“basic stuff,” he said.
Even with all the injuries and dis-
appointing performances Saturday, 
there were a few bright spots in a 
mostly grim offensive showing. 
Murphy threw for 68 yards and a 
touchdown on 7-of-11 passing, and 
freshman Jeff Driskel picked up 29 
yards through the air and 23 more on the ground.
Rainey ran for 26 yards on five 
carries and made strong safety Matt 
Elam miss badly on an open-field 
tackle, and a few receiving options 
emerged as Quinton Dunbar, Ste-
phen Alli and tight end A.C. Leon-ard showed promise.
“We’re not as old as we’d like 
to be, but that’s what we’ve got. 
We’re not as deep at some positions 
as we’d like to be, but that’s what 
we’ve got,” Muschamp said. “We’re 
not going to make excuses for any-
thing, whether it’s injuries or youth. 
It’s our job to perform at a cham-pionship level, and that’s what we 
plan to do.”FOOTBALL , from page 19Max Reed / Alligator Staff

Hammond Jr. in the Orange and Blue Debut on Saturday.
him to have the starting job locked down.
Muschamp and others on the team blamed 
the struggles on a lack of protection. UF only 
used seven offensive linemen Saturday be-
cause of injuries, throwing the whole offense out of sync. Two of Brantley’s first four passes were batted down by defensive linemen.
But Murphy was working with the same 
patchwork line, and the passing game looked slightly better with him under center. Receiv-er Stephen Alli said Murphy has been more accurate this spring than he was last semester 
— his first on campus. He is also more confi-
dent and now takes command in the huddle.
For his part, Murphy talked about the 
mental errors he needs to clean up. On fourth-
and-goal from the 4-yard line, he dumped the 
ball into the flats. During a two-minute drill, he took a sack. Two plays later, he was inter -
cepted after underthrowing Malcolm Jones on a crossing route.
Murphy did not play well enough to leap 
to No. 1 on the depth chart, but at the same time, Brantley did nothing to separate him-self. And this might not even be a two-horse 
race.
Jeff Driskel or Jacoby Brissett could step 
up. Heck, the biggest pass of the day came 
from the arm of Christian Provancha.  
But for now, with everything else seem-
ingly equal, Brantley’s experience has served as the trump card.
“John is the leader of the team,” Murphy 
said. “He’s been here, and he has experience. 
We go as he goes, and he has been working 
really hard this offseason. He’s the guy.”
But if playing time is accompanied with 
nothing but disappointment, how valuable is that experience?
About as valuable as that depth chart.TYLER , from page 19Sophomore D-line trio shows growth
