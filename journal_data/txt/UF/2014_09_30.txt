A combined drug task force investiga-
tion led to the arrest and prosecution of a 
Gainesville cocaine trafﬁ  cker. 
Reginald White, 31, was sentenced to 12 
years in prison Friday after he pled guilty to charges including the sale and trafﬁ  ck-ing of cocaine. His Jan. 31 arrest came af-
ter a three-month investigation involving 
Gainesville Police and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
The task force and GPD’s SWAT team 
seized 17.1 ounces of cocaine, three pounds 
of marijuana and $30,000 in cash from 
White’s residence at 4215 SW 22nd Lane, apartment 131. Between controlled narcot-ics purchases from White and the products 
obtained through the search warrant, ofﬁ  -
cers seized a half kilogram of cocaine dur-ing the entire investigation. 
White has been in prison twice before 
for drug charges — once for marijuana charges and once for cocaine and pos-session of a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon charges. 
“I’m proud that our Drug Task Force 
has delivered another blow to the drug dealers of Alachua County,” GPD spokes-man Ben Tobias said in a press release. “Our citizens may not hear about the work 
of the Task Force each day, but can trust 
that they are working extremely hard to keep dangerous drugs off our streets.”VOLUME 109 ISSUE 26 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014

Additionally, no campaigning 
complaints have been ﬁ  led, accord-ing to UF elections commission chairman Harold Holder.
As elections take place, Swamp 
party candidates and the two inde-pendent candidates grow anxious.
“It’s been really great to see 
the turnout and support of people from Hume,” said 18-year-old UF civil engineering freshman Preston Jones, who is running for Senate in the Hume area. 
Swamp spokeswoman Katie 
Backstrand said she hopes there will be a high voter turnout.
“Our candidates have been work-
ing hard to raise awareness about elections, and we are hoping stu-dents will go to the polls and show their support,” Backstrand said in an email.

As UF students sat down for 
their Monday afternoon lecture 
classes, about 120 engineering students raced scooters in the ﬁ  rst “Electric Scooter Olym-pics.”
Peter Ifju’s capstone me-
chanical senior design class participated in the competition during ninth period behind the New Engineering Building on Circle Drive.
The event was a part of 
Ifju’s class assignment. This as-signment requires students, in teams of about six, to take apart and reassemble an Electric Ra-zor Scooter, Model E300.
Twenty student teams and 
one team of teaching assistants competed in the games. The teaching assistants decorated their scooter with pom-poms, 
foam horns and a green gator-
shaped mat for the body of the scooter.
The placing teams would get 
to choose a box of candy. The ultimate prize was a trophy of tire-pressure gauges made by Ifju.
Robert Orth, a 23-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering se-nior, spent his weekend practic-ing ﬁ  gure-eights for the event.

tions,” Robert Orth said of his Student Electric Scooter Olympics

Just Keep Scooting
UF ﬁ  fth-year mechanical engineering student Diana Nelson, 23, competes in the Electric Scooter Olympics 
ﬁ  gure-eight event for her senior design class Monday afternoon outside the chemical engineering building.
Scooting rain or shine
team, “But I’m still shooting for 
No. 1.”
Despite the daylong rain, stu-
dents showed up to class with hel-
mets in hand and scooters at the 
ready.
The rain stopped just as the fes-
tivities began around 4:10 p.m.
The events consisted of an up-
hill race, a downhill race and a ﬁ  g-ure-eight event. Teams used their 
knowledge of physics and scoot-
ers to help them compete for their 
times.
Competitors were allowed to 
push off the ground to start but were given a two-second penalty 
for every misstep after.
Teams chose their lightest 
members for the uphill race and 
their largest members for the 
downhill race, hoping to use size 
to their advantage. By the ﬁ  gure-
eight competition, batteries were dying and scooters were skidding, 
but every team managed to ﬁ  nish the events.
Ifju said the Olympics get stu-
dents to understand the mechanics of the scooter, and to evaluate the 
performance of each scooter before 
the project begins.
“We’re actually applying what 
we learn in school,” said Daniela 
Soyos, a 22-year-old UF mechani-
cal engineering senior and student 
in Ifju’s class. “This is breaking down something that’s actually seen in real-life applications.”
The competition lasted an hour. 
Team 20, consisting of six seniors, won the overall competition after winning the uphill race and plac-ing second in the ﬁ  gure-eight com-
petition.
“The team comprised of the 
graduate teaching assistants, rid-
ing their tricked-out scooter, were utterly humiliated by the young-er, more hungry undergraduate teams,” Ifju said.
No students or scooters were 
injured during the games.SCOOTER , from page 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014

The 352 is now represented on prime-
time television.
ABC’s new drama, “How to Get Away 
with Murder,” premiered Thursday and 
has Gator alumnus Lenny Platt on its cast 
list playing quarterback Griffin O’Reilly.
The 2006 criminology graduate said he 
still has the Gainesville phone number that 
came with a new phone he bought as a stu-dent.
“I kept the number proudly,” the 30-year-
old said. “I have no plans to change it.”
Before settling in Gainesville, Platt was 
born in Philadelphia, where he lived until 
moving to Orlando at 11 years old. With 
Universal Studios and Disney World prac-tically in his backyard, he was exposed to film and TV, he said.
“I was immersed in it,” he said. “It fu-
eled my appetite for cinematic and dramat-ic arts.”
At UF, he took classes in criminology for 
his major, mass communication for his mi-
nor and theater — just for fun, he said. A lover of crime shows like “Dexter,” 
he said his most memorable UF class was 
forensics. But then he would write, direct 
and act in a former student film club. He 
melded his studies and passions, becoming a law student at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan and an actor, where he typically played alleged criminals in shows like “Law and Order: SVU.”
“It was all helpful background,” Platt 
said. “I’m glad I went to a school as rich and vibrant as UF.”
Outside the classroom, he met lifelong 
friends in the Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity and his now-fiancee, a graduate of the School of Journalism and Communica-tions.
Platt’s brother Chris, a 20-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore, said some of his brother’s experiences influenced his decision to attend UF.
“Lenny always said his college years 
were some of the best of his life and that this school gave him some lifetime friends,” Chris said. “I feel some solidarity with him now that I’m a Gator. I can relate to him more, and I try to catch him up about what’s changing here.”
Platt said while he knew he wanted to 
pursue acting, he strived to become a well-
rounded person, adding entertainment 
lawyer and BBQ Film event production company partner to his resume.
Being a Gator also had a hand in his 
character building. The UF community may notice some similarities between Tim Tebow and Platt’s character O’Reilly — in-cluding their haircuts.
“I modeled Griffin, a star athlete, after 
Tebow,” Platt said. “Tebow is Christian, a 
quarterback and a rock star on the field. But 
of course Tebow would never be embroiled in a murder mystery.”  
Fourteen million people tuned into the 
“How to Get Away with Murder” pilot fea-turing names like Academy Award nomi-nee Viola Davis.“I watched the show last week and 
giggled to myself when my brother briefly popped up,” Chris said. “I’m rooting for 
him even though he’s likely a murderer.”
Journalism interim chair and associ-
ate professor Ted Spiker also watched the 
show. He met Platt and his fiancee when they were at UF, and they keep in touch.
“I was thrilled to see Lenny on the show 
Thursday,” Spiker wrote in an email. “Len-ny is so humble and passionate about what he does, and I’ve always loved that he em-
braces all kinds of new adventures. This is 
a great new one for him.”
Platt said while working on the show is 
daunting, he is excited to see his character grow in substance. Seeing the show’s ads on subways and taxis is humbling and sur-real, he said.
“A couple of nights after we saw ‘How 
to Get Away With Murder,’ my wife and I 
were flipping through the channels,” Spik-
er said. “When we hit a rerun of ‘Law & Order,’ she said, ‘Wait, that’s Lenny.’ And there he was on that show, too. And I think that’s the way it’s going to be — we are all going to see a whole lot of him.”

From nearly 200 nominees, 
two UF Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences faculty members were nationally se-lected and recognized for their 
contributions to the agriculture 
industry.
Alexa Lamm and Samuel F. 
Hutton, both 36 years old, were awarded Vance Publishing Corporation’s second annual 40 Under 40 Award, which rec-ognizes people under the age of 40 who have contributed to 
America’s food system.
Lamm and Hutton, along 
with two other UF graduates, 
were honored. 
Founded more than 75 years 
ago, Vance Publishing is a pri-vately held media enterprise that serves the agricultural business through various mar-
keting products and services 
such as magazines, newspapers and newsletters.
The company asked for 
nominations of the most inno-vative leaders in agriculture, and a six-judge panel with dis-tinguished agricultural career backgrounds chose the win-
ners, said Vance Publishing.
Lamm, a UF IFAS assistant 
professor of agricultural educa-
tion and communication, was recently named associate direc-tor of the UF IFAS Center for Public Issues Education.  
She said one of her primary 
research interest areas is public opinions of water quality and quantity and how they have impacted the agriculture and natural resource industry.
“I think one of the reasons I 
was most surprised and pleased with this award was it’s largely 
an industry award, not a fac-
ulty award,” Lamm said. “So it’s a little different from other awards and special in that way because it’s being recognized for my work actually impacting the industry itself.”
Since 2010, Hutton has 
worked as an assistant profes-
sor of horticultural sciences at 
UF’s Gulf Coast Research and Education Center. 
Hutton earned his doctorate 
from UF in horticulture sciences in 2008. His research focuses on advanced tomato resistance to bacterial spots and developing machine-harvestable tomatoes.
Hutton hopes the award will 
shed more light on the tomato-
breeding industry in Florida, 
which is valued at close to $500 million each year.
“We’re the only public 
breeding program in the state and one of the few public to-mato breeding programs in the nation,” he said.
The honorees will be fea-
tured in nine November and December print publications, and their profiles will be posted on 40Under40ag.com.
“With the awards granted, it 
will only give UF’s IFAS more credibility,” said UF agricul-
tural education and commu-
nication senior Mary Hannah Miller, 21.UF faculty recognized 
for ‘40 Under 40’ top agriculture award

William S. Reeser will now man-
age UF’s $2.7 billion investment 
portfolio as the new chief invest-ment officer of UF’s investment cor-poration.
Reeser, who previously managed 
investments for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, will begin as the chief officer on Nov. 10.
The corporation may face chang-
es, said Janine Sikes, speaking on be-half of UF Investment Corporation.
“From my understanding and 
talking to Andrew Banks, the board 
chairman, the corporation is con-
stantly re-evaluating their invest-ments,” she said.
Reeser will be managing UF’s 
money management group, which includes the University of Florida Foundation, the University of Flor-
ida Research Foundation and the 
University Athletic Association to name a few.
Reeser was the 
senior vice presi-
dent and chief in-vestment officer for the American Lebanese Syrian 
Associated Chari-
ties (ALSAC) which is the ex-clusive fundrais-
ing organization of St. Jude’s Chil-dren’s Research Hospital.
“Bill Reeser is a highly seasoned 
CIO who brings a wealth of experi-ence and a keen eye for successful investments to UFICO,” said Banks, 
UFICO chair, in a UF press release. 
“We are fortunate to have him lead UFICO’s talented and dedicated team of investment professionals.”
Reeser has 35 years of financial 
management experience, according to the press release. He began his own firm, Reeser Advisory Services, before joining ALSAC/St. Jude’s.
“Bill’s exceptional background 
and his more than three decades of experience in the investment world give me tremendous confidence that 
he’s the exactly right person for that 
job,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a press release. 
Reeser, who received his bach-
elor’s degree from the University of Tennessee and his master’s from the University of Memphis, will take over for Edward Kelly, who was named interim CIO in 2013.
Sikes said she cannot disclose 
Reeser’s salary because of the UF Investment Corporation’s privacy policy.UF gets new chief investment officer

Berkeley Hoflund stood behind 
her bar’s counter for the last time 
Monday afternoon, ringing up the remainder of Stubbies & Steins’ merchandise.
The German-themed bar closed 
Saturday, parting ways with ban-ners, T-shirts, glassware, beer, cuckoo clocks and bar stools at the sale this week.
About 200 people packed into 
the bar to buy the memorabilia and bet on auctioned items until about 9 p.m. Monday, including 
the outdoor Stubbies & Steins 
sign. Hoflund said it was harder to take down some of the pieces than it was to sell them.
“I sent a lot of great vibes to a 
lot of great people,” she said.
Hoflund opened the bar with 
her father in 2003 and said the sale’s turnout was a testament to 
how loyal her customers were.
“I’m willing to let things go 
and move on to a new chapter in 
my life,” she said.  
Elena Mendenhall, 25, bought 
beer signs, T-shirts and beer trays at the sale, which her father col-lects. She’s been coming to Stub-bies & Steins for about four years.
“I’ve had a lot of cool memo-ries,” Mendenhall said. “It’s an awesome place for beer drinkers like me.”
Mendenhall, who graduated 
from UF in 2012, said she didn’t drink beer often until she started 
coming to Stubbies. She and her 
friends would gather around the long table in the middle of the bar each Wednesday to play cards over drinks.
“When I turned 21 and started 
going out, I went to this place and fell in love,” said Menden-hall, who received an “offender 
plaque” inscribed with the nick-
name “Princess.”
The personalized “offender 
plaques” were offered to custom-ers who drank at least 100 dif-ferent beers within one year and were placed on a map. The map is one of the pieces Hoflund said she didn’t want to part with.
Anne Morello, 24, purchased 
a liter beer glass, T-shirt and shot glasses. She bought the items for her boyfriend, whom she took to Stubbies after his trip to Germa-ny’s Oktoberfest last year.
Morello, a UF construction 
graduate student, said Stubbies & Steins was the only bar she went 
to in Gainesville.
“I was sad when I heard they 
were closing because I just moved down the road and was looking 
forward to coming here,” she said.Morello’s favorite item was the 
curry ketchup.
“The atmosphere was cool and unique,” Morello said. “Not a lot of bars in Gainesville have themes like this.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Smartphones and wallets are be-
coming one and the same. 
Only 10 percent of money in 
American circulation is cash, and 
as consumers increasingly rely on 
electronic services like Apple Pay 
and debit and credit cards, econo-mists are asking if the days of cash are over.
Gator Growl executive producer 
Devin McDaniel said the show’s team took the trend into account.
“We noticed that a lot of students 
don’t carry cash ever,” McDaniel 
said.
The 21-year-old UF marketing 
senior said students can now pay with cards, using a Square Credit 
Card Reader on campus for ticket and T-shirt transactions. 
“We have a lot more card sales 
than cash, for sure,” McDaniel said.
Camila Portillo, a 19-year-old 
UF advertising sophomore, said she 
carries cash for emergencies but uses 
cards about 75 percent of the time.
“I was always raised being told 
that at least carry $20 with you for the sake of emergencies,” she said. “Otherwise, cash is just like for pen-ny-worth things.” Wells Fargo is one of six banks 
that has already partnered with Apple Pay, and Reitz Union branch manager Scott Weaber said electron-ic payment has its benefits.
“Not only are electronic pay-
ments more convenient, they can 
also allow for increased security,” he 
said. “It creates a paper trail, where-as cash and coin do not.”  
But people assume that new in-
ventions will replace the old, said 29-year-old UF economics doctoral candidate Adam Narkiewicz.
“(Bills and coins) are going to be 
replaced, and they are already re-
placed in some places and for some 
uses,” Narkiewicz said, “but for some uses they are not going to be replaced.”Fewer Americans paying with cash

grabbed the right side of the victim’s buttock and walked away smiling. After Levy, who lives at 3440 SE 28th Place, was read his rights, he told officers he flicked the victim on the buttocks as part of a game. 
Levy was arrested on charges of lewd or lascivious 
molestation of a person under 16 years old. His bond is 
currently set at $50,000.

A Gainesville man was arrested Monday morning af-ter police said he took prescription pills from a paraple-
gic man and threatened him with a knife. 
Donald J. Sherlock, 37, stood by the victim’s bedside 
shortly after midnight and pulled out the victim’s oxy-
codone pill bottle. He then pulled out a 4.5-inch blade and told the victim, “If you tell anyone you know what’s going to happen,” according to a re-port. 
The defendant helped the victim’s 
mother with caretaking necessities for 
about three months prior to the inci-dent. The victim — who is confined 
to a bed — said he was in fear for his 
life and safety during the incident. 
Officers said the victim was very nervous when they 
arrived. While on the scene, officers said the victim kept 
telling his mother he was scared Sherlock would come back and hurt him. 
Sherlock was arrested on charges of aggravated as-
sault and the exploitation of the disabled. He was re-leased Monday on a bond of $10,000.Police roundup: child assault; theft“Otherwise, cash is just

Fall 2014 Elections: 
A stand against 
one-party rule
In the Spring of 2014, The Independent Florida Alligator en-
dorsed the Swamp Party for the Student Government ex-ecutive elections. We expressed reservations about the po-
tential for one-party rule in SG but determined that Swamp’s 
qualiﬁ  ed slate of candidates and effective campaigning made 
them worthy of a formal endorsement.
During the Fall 2014 SG Senate campaign, the steady march 
toward one-party rule has continued, now that Swamp is the 
only party ﬁ  elding candidates for the elections.
Ordinarily, we would encourage all UF students to exercise 
their right to vote for and elect senators to represent them in SG. But with the exception of the independent candidates running in the Hume and District B races, such votes would be rendered meaningless by the Swamp Party’s dominance of the ballot.
The Swamp Party has produced a number of platform points 
that are worthy of support. The party’s plans to improve safety 
by expanding nighttime transportation options and widening 
the off-campus reach of UF Alerts are encouraging.
Swamp also plans to increase the transparency of course costs 
by listing textbook and access code fees during course registra-tion. UF students have a right to know the full ﬁ  nancial cost of their education, so this is a step in the right direction.
Despite the strength of its platform, the Swamp Party’s 
sketchy past and shady campaign tactics cannot be ignored. Swamp may very well have the best interests of UF students at 
heart, but the party’s laudable ends do not justify the question-
able means it has used to gain and consolidate its power.
SG’s inexorable decline into one-party dominance is not 
solely the fault of the Swamp Party. Leaders of opposing groups — in particular the Students Party — failed to capitalize on stu-dents’ discontent with SG representation and the UF popula-tion’s desire for substantive change.
Through the highs and lows of the various opposition par-
ties, Swamp’s relentless, well-oiled campaign machine has con-
tinued to operate at its usual high level.
Swamp leaders have pledged to consider alternative points 
of view even after they take full control of the Senate. However, 
the groupthink and solidarity that has characterized the Swamp Party in previous years make such statements dubious at best.
We encourage UF students to support the independent can-
didates running to represent them. We believe that they will bring important, diverse viewpoints and priorities to SG.
For the rest of UF, an endorsement of the Swamp Party 
would be wholly irrelevant. Regardless of how many students vote in this week’s elections, Swamp will claim dominance over the Senate once the results have been tallied.
We encourage all UF students to consider the threat that one-
party rule poses to responsive and democratic representation at our school. Despite the fact that Swamp is running mostly unop-posed, the right to vote is powerful, and all students should ex-ercise that right at the polls today and Wednesday. UF deserves a diverse and vibrant SG, but only if its constituents make it so.

coffee today? Today’s question: Are you going to vote in the Student 
Government elections? Censorship, despite intent, is unpatriotic
Last week in Jefferson County, Colorado, nearly 
a thousand high school students walked out of their classrooms in protest of proposed curriculum 
changes to their history classes.
The walkouts were staged in response to a proposal 
submitted by the new conservative school board, which suggested setting up a review committee to make sure Advanced Placement U.S. history classes promote patrio-tism, free enterprise and respect for authority. According to a draft of the proposal, AP U.S. history teachers would have to “present positive aspects of the United States and its heritage,” while being prohibited from encouraging or condoning “civil disorder, social strife or disregard of the law.”
Teachers and students in several schools across the 
district have understandably expressed concern that this review committee will lead to censorship of educational materials.
School board member Julie Williams, a supporter of 
the review committee, criticized the current AP U.S. his-tory curriculum for focusing too much on gender, class, race, ethnicity and grievance. In her eyes, emphasizing the historical struggles of different groups is “American-
bashing.”
I understand the desire to encourage students to be 
proud of their country, but that patriotism must not come 
at the cost of distorting or censoring history. This proposal would essentially strip educators of their ability to offer students a comprehensive course on U.S. history. Instead of encouraging students to think critically and examine how the past shapes the present, teachers would be re-stricted to only presenting materials that portray America 
in a wholly favorable light.
These changes would essentially transform a college-
level history class into a political platform with the goal of 
endorsing American pride while simultaneously discour-aging civil disobedience. In addition to being a shameful attempt to propagandize education for ideological pur-poses, the proposal is also inherently un-American.
One of the most cherished rights of an American citi-zen is the ability to protest unjust laws. Such protests contributed to the abolition of slavery, the approval of women’s suffrage and the social progress achieved 
during the civil rights move-
ment of the 1950s and ‘60s. If people weren’t willing to stand up against the government and make their voices heard, these monumental steps in our history might never have occurred. Civil 
disobedience has been essential for driving positive social change since the founding of our country.
The students who are rightfully protesting against the 
school board’s proposal have been backed by the College Board, which issued this statement of support: “These students recognize that the social disorder can — and sometimes must — be disrupted in the pursuit of liberty and justice.” The board emphasized these ideas are “es-sential within the study of a college-level, AP U.S. History course.”
The Jefferson County School Board majority may be-
lieve its actions will promote patriotism, but censorship in the history classroom will only promote ignorance and indifference to the social struggles that have made our na-tion what it is today. Students don’t deserve to be robbed of the challenging and rewarding experience of a college-level history class, and they most certainly don’t deserve to be treated as children who need to be told what to think.
Being patriotic isn’t about blindly loving your country 
and ignoring its ﬂ  aws. Real patriotism is about embracing 
your country’s strengths, acknowledging its weaknesses 
and ﬁ  ghting every day to make it an even better place in which to live.
As students in Jefferson County ﬁ  ght passionately for 
their education, maybe the school board will learn what true patriotism is.

Once again, the Swamp Party wal-
loped the competition in the stu-dent Senate elections this week.
What’s ironic about that statement 
is that as I’m writing this article, not a 
single ballot has been cast. The certainty 
that Swamp will once again walk away with Student Government elections can in no way be called into question for two 
simple reasons: minority parties and can-
didates mounted no effective opposition to Swamp 
this year, and the Swamp Party has a complete lock on the constituency groups — namely fraternities and sororities — they need to win.
Despite Swamp’s overwhelming dominance, 
Swamp representatives still campaign throughout campus, handing out stickers and occasionally look-ing desperate enough to strike up a conversation with fellow students. The image of Swamp campaigning 
is almost as hilarious as someone campaigning for 
Vladimir Putin in Russia. Let’s face it: like Putin, it’s 
an absolute truth that Swamp will win, regardless of if any candidate or party representative campaigns on Swamp’s behalf.
Here’s a question for Swamp: if you have no com-
petition and have near totalitarian control over SG, why bother to campaign? Is it to give off the appear-ance of a functioning democracy on UF’s campus, or do you think it makes the party look good?
Now, Swamp is not entirely to blame for its over-
whelming majority. The Students Party — the minor-ity party in the Senate — has ceased to exist, and since no other party appears ready to challenge the major-ity, Swamp rules supreme.
Generally, the issues surrounding a one-party rule 
of SG would not be a big deal. After all, we’re not talk-ing about legislative and governing bodies that rule your life with an iron ﬁ  st like Putin, but SG does wield signiﬁ  cant power on UF’s campus and controls a siz-able multi-million-dollar annual budget.
Although the minority was close to taking control 
of SG following the Spring 2012 elections, the domi-nance of the Swamp Party — or the Unite Party, as it was previously known — has never truly been threat-ened. 
To win, a new party would have to ﬁ  nd a way to 
break the Greek voting bloc, devise a strategy to win almost every other vote or drastically increase turn-out.
If this seems damn near impossible, 
that’s because it probably is. Any minor-ity party seeking to challenge Swamp’s 
dominance has a tremendous uphill 
climb.
Maybe comparing the Swamp Party 
to the Russian autocracy is a bit unfair. 
After all, nothing in Swamp’s policy plat-
form is particularly nefarious. Swamp 
wants more solar power on campus and hand sani-
tizer dispensers in dining halls and dorms, both of which seem like noble endeavors. 
Although Swamp has engaged in questionable 
campaign tactics in previous elections, none of those 
were anywhere near as heinous as the persecution 
and torture faced by Russian dissidents.
Swamp may offer a slew of positive-sounding pro-
posals. However, what drives the majority to work 
and ﬁ  ght harder for all Gators is a functioning minor-
ity that can actually challenge Swamp’s rule. It’s likely 
that our student fees — also known as university tax-es — would be better spent if a functioning minority could challenge Swamp’s spending proposals.
UF students deserve additional checks and balanc-
es within the Senate to ensure that our fees are spent wisely and aren’t wasted by Swamp.
As a grad student, I often feel far removed from 
UF’s complicated and arcane political process. How-
ever, from an outsider’s perspective, it certainly seems 
that we can and should do better to provide a truly 
democratic — or representative — system.
SG’s $20 million budget, largely comprised of stu-
dent fees, is nothing to scoff at or ignore. Turnout is likely to be excruciatingly low for the elections this week and, unless major reforms happen, little will break Swamp’s control over SG, nor will a serious mi-nority party challenge Swamp’s authority.
If that ever happens, most of us will be long gone, 
complaining about how our state or federal govern-ments spend our tax dollars and completely forget-ting that we conveniently ignored how our peers spent our funds while we were students at UF.
For the time being, we might as well enjoy Swamp’s 
rule because it’s not going anywhere.

opinions@alligator.org In January, Ohio 
inmate Dennis McGuire suf-
fered a 25-minute suffocation. In 
April, Oklahoma inmate Clay-
ton Lockett died after 43 min-utes due to a heart attack from an untested drug mixture. And just last month in Ari-zona, Joseph Rudolph Wood gasped and snorted for almost 2 hours before ﬁ  nally taking his last breath.
These events, coupled with 
Judge Cormac Carney’s rul-ing that the death penalty is unconstitutional in California, have rightfully put the penalty by lethal injection under glar-ing scrutiny. Lawmakers must listen to voters and take the California ruling of the death 
penalty seriously in order to 
mend the system.
As with advancements in 
every ﬁ  eld, practices that have been in existence for a long time should be checked. At ﬁ  rst glance, the California rul-ing is astonishing considering that the U.S. Supreme Court 
has, in the past, upheld death 
by ﬁ  ring squad, hanging, le-thal gas, electrocution and lethal injection. None of these methods of inﬂ  icting death vi-olate the Eighth Amendment’s 
prohibition against cruel and 
unusual punishment, accord-ing to the high court. Howev-er, we can’t redeﬁ  ne ourselves without redeﬁ  ning the laws that govern us. Justice must certainly be served on behalf of every victim, but the means of justice shouldn’t mean more 
inhumane bloodshed, as in the 
case of Wood and others.
Not only is capital punish-
ment unconstitutional in that it is cruel and unusual, but there are also multiple areas that need work.
The price tag of these ex-
ecutions is one such area. 
According to assessments by 
Judge Arthur Alarcon and Paula Mitchell in 2011, the cost of the death penalty in California comes up to more than $4 billion since 1978. If the governor commuted the sentences of those remaining on death row to life without parole, it would help save $170 million per year. Over the next 20 years, those sav-
ings accumulate to $5 billion.
The effectiveness of not 
only the execution method it-
self but also the entire system is another area that needs re-pair. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, compared to states that do administer the death penalty, 
states that do not follow it have consistently 
lower rates of ho-micide. The gap has grown since 1990. According 
to these statistics, though the ultimate aim of condemning prisoners to death is to de-crease the rate of murder in the society, something seems to be amiss.
As stated in The Econo-
mist, the average prisoner who is executed in California 
has spent 25 years on death 
row — much longer than the national average of nearly 16 years. 
The root of the efﬁ  cacy is-
sue seems to be that the long delays in executions fail to deter potential murderers out there. If the death penalty is 
playing no role in inﬂ  uencing 
the minds of the criminals be-fore they commit the crimes, it doesn’t serve a point.
The victims’ families and 
friends should not be left out either. Most certainly, they de-serve peace of mind. But peo-ple must understand that an 
eye for an eye only makes the 
world blind. The death penal-ty, in a sense, is simply based on revenge, a get-even mea-sure that destroys people that have destroyed others. In the 
process, nothing is gained.
Rather than maximizing 
the punishment, lawmakers 
need to focus all efforts on minimizing the crime rate, the root of the issue. Educa-tion might be one key factor in tackling homicide. According to The Mercury, 70 percent of 
this nation’s prison popula-
tion has failed to receive high school diplomas. Long-term research has shown that if more is invested into pre-K education, graduation rates can be boosted by as much as 44 percent and keep young adults on the right side of 
the law. According to a 2013 
Research and Development (RAND) report, correctional education programs for in-mates are also effective — those who participated were 43 percent less likely to be-come repeat offenders.
Instead of investing so 
much into a penalty that is unconstitutional, inhumane, costly and ineffective all in one, 
preventive measures rather 
than consequential measures should pull more weight. The death penalty is a moral and ﬁ  nancial disaster that needs to meet its own end.

UF pharmacy students are pro-
moting health care during American 
Pharmacist Month this October.
The UF College of Pharmacy’s 
American Pharmacists Association Academy of Student Pharmacists wants students to understand the extensive role pharmacists play in 
health care besides filling prescrip-
tions.
“Pharmacists are one of the most 
accessible but under-utilized health care providers,” said American Pharmacist Month co-chair Laura 
Robayo. As part of American Pharmacist 
Month, the organization is advertis-
ing on UF marquees to motivate stu-
dents to get to know their pharma-
cists. The group will also volunteer at Walgreens’ senior day, where it will communicate the many ways in which pharmacists can have a posi-tive impact on elderly health.
Pharmacists are advocates 
for their patients, said Robayo, a 23-year-old UF second-year phar-
macy student. They provide infor-
mation so that patients can make informed medical decisions.
“Their breadth of knowledge en-
ables them to assist patients in the management of various health con-ditions,” she said.
Pharmacists are taught to look at 
more than just the disease and the 
medication to treat it.
“Sometimes the best medication 
to treat a disease may not be the best 
medication option for the patient,” said Carrie Hoffman, a 21-year-old 
UF second-year pharmacy student. “A pharmacist’s role is to treat the 
patient not the disease.”
The role of a pharmacist is much 
more than medications. It is pro-viding personalized attention and explanations to patients on an indi-vidualized basis.
“They are detail-orientated indi-
viduals who know a lot about drug therapy and health care,” said Nata-lie Brumwell, a 20-year-old UF nu-trition junior.
The accessibility of a pharmacist 
at drugstores makes them excellent resources as well, Brumwell said. 
“Some people are surprised to 
hear about all the career opportu-nities a pharmacist has,” Brumwell said. “There are also careers work-ing in a clinical setting such as a hospital. I really liked the idea that 
pharmacists can be a go-to source 
within a community for health care advice.”
Outside of October, the organiza-
tion hosts health screenings to edu-cate the community about health care issues. The students also pro-vide blood glucose control, prescrip-tion drug abuse and immunization 
information to the community. 
“It may seem intimidating to a 
patient when asked, ‘Do you have 
any questions for the pharmacist?’” Hoffman said. “But, that is what the pharmacist is there for.”

GatorWell and the UF Coun-
seling and Wellness Center are at-
tempting to erase stigmas surround-ing mental health issues at UF. 
The UF student health organiza-
tions released the Fall 2014 designs for UFlourish, a social marketing campaign collaboration, and this se-mester they’re targeting the LGBTQ and black student communities.
This is the first time the campaign 
is targeting specific student popula-tions after launching in Spring 2013.
The campaign’s main goals are 
to remove stigmas surrounding mental health issues and encourage students to use strategies to prevent mental illnesses, said Dr. Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell.
“With the first campaign, 
it was very broad, appeal-
ing to all students,” Miller said.  
“Now we’re looking at specific stu-dent populations that may be more 
at risk for stress issues.”
The marketing campaign, which 
encourages students to “Keep it Real” with friends and “Just Ask” for 
help, is being funded by a $296,000 
federal grant from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
The grant also supports the 
CWC’s online programs designed to address suicide prevention on cam-pus, Miller said.
The campaign designs focus on 
LGBTQ and black student commu-nities to promote using inclusive language when speaking about 
mental health issues.
“It’s probably more effective than a broader scope,” said Marcy 
Maycock, an 18-year-old UF health science freshman. 
Maycock has never been to the 
Counseling and Wellness Center but said she has considered it and recommended it to friends before.
UFlourish aims to remind stu-
dents that many resources are avail-able to them through GatorWell and the CWC, Miller said.
“I don’t have any needs for coun-
seling, but if I did I’d look into it,” 
said Rachel Kraskow, an 18-year-old 
exploratory freshman at UF.
According to the 2013 Association 
for University and College Counsel-ing Center Directors’ annual survey, 46.2 percent of students experience anxiety, and 39.3 percent of students struggle with depression.
Miller said the next phase of the 
UFlourish campaign is to expand 
and include even more specific stu-
dent populations.
“We’re trying to reach as many 
different students through as many different channels as we can,” she said.UFlourish: preventative mental health� HE RAN PAST GUARDS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — The 
intruder who climbed a fence 
made it farther inside the White House than the Secret Service has publicly acknowledged, 
the Washington Post and New 
York Times newspapers report-ed Monday. The disclosures came on the eve of a congres-sional oversight hearing with the director of the embattled agency assigned to protect the president’s life.
Citing unnamed sources — 
three people familiar with the incident and a congressional aide — the newspapers said Omar J. Gonzalez ran past the guard at the front door and into the East Room, which is about halfway across the first floor of the building. Gonzalez was eventually “tackled” by a 
counter-assault agent, accord-
ing to the Post, which was first to report the news.
In the hours after the fence-
jumper incident, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told The Associated Press that the suspect had been apprehended just inside the North Portico 
doors of the White House.
The Secret Service also said 
that night that the suspect had 
been unarmed — an assertion that was revealed to be false the next day when officials ac-knowledged that Gonzalez had a knife with him when he was apprehended.
Getting so far would have 
required Gonzalez to dash through the main entrance hall, turn a corner, then run through the center hallway halfway across the first floor of the building, which spans 168 feet total, according to the White House Historical Association.Secret Service director Julia 
Pierson was scheduled to tes-tify before a House committee Tuesday for the first time since the Sept. 19 incident. The new details about a far more signifi-cant breach were expected to dominate the lawmakers’ in-
quiries.
A Secret Service spokesman 
declined to comment on the lat-
est details because of the ongo-ing investigation.
It was a security lapse that 
could have had serious conse-quences if the intruder had been heavily armed and if the presi-
dent and his family had been 
home. No one was hurt, but it’s not the first incident involving the White House itself, raising the question of whether the lat-est breach is part of a pattern of delayed reactions to threats to the executive mansion. The Secret Service says that is not 
the case. And President Barack 
Obama has confidence in the Secret Service to do its job.
The Post reported over the 
weekend that the Secret Service did not immediately respond to shots fired at the White House in 2011, amid what the agency describes as uncertainty about where the shots originated. Four days later, it was discov-
ered that at least one of the shots 
broke the glass of a window on the third level of the mansion, the Secret Service said.
The Secret Service has been 
trying to rehabilitate its image since a 2012 prostitution scan-
dal erupted during a presiden-
tial visit to Colombia.
Earlier this year, Pierson met 
privately with senators after an agent was found drunk in a ho-tel during a presidential trip to the Netherlands. 
There were no charges filed 
against the agents, and Pierson 
said neither incident was repre-
sentative of the entire agency.Officials say intruder

� THE DISEASE IS SIMI-
LAR TO MAD COW.
JULIA LOPEZ

As a neurological disease 
spreads in deer throughout the 
country, Florida hunters are 
reminded of importation laws 
prohibiting out-of-state deer, moose or elk carcasses from crossing state borders.
The law even includes deer 
semen, said Tony Young, Flori-da Fish and Wildlife Conserva-tion Commission spokesman. If the sperm is infected and 
used for breeding purposes, it 
has the potential to spread the Chronic Waste Disease, which is comparable to mad cow dis-
ease.
“Once a deer is infected with 
the disease, it is fatal,” Young 
said. “That deer will eventually die.”
The disease destroys the ani-
mal’s brain and causes the body to deteriorate from the inside, said Samantha Wisely, a UF 
wildlife ecology and conserva-
tion professor. It is referred to as the “Nose to Nose” disease because it can only be passed from deer to deer through nose 
exposure, Wisely said.
It most likely cannot be 
passed to humans, and no cases 
have been reported in Florida.
Still, Young urged precaution 
when handling animals.
“I wouldn’t kiss them on the 
nose anytime soon,” he said.Out-of-state deer meat can 
be transported to Florida, but it must ﬁ  rst be deboned in the state the deer was shot, Young 
said. If hunters want to keep 
deer heads, it still has to be tak-en to a taxidermist in the state it was shot.
The infective agent is more 
likely to be concentrated within the brain, eyes, spinal cord, lymph nodes, tonsils and spleen of the animal, Wisely said. The 
disease cannot be killed, and 
this infective agent — called a prion — can be accidentally deposited into the environment where it can remain for years 
and infect other deer.
The disease causes plaque 
buildup in the deer’s brain 
which causes neurological dam-
age. There are several neurolog-
ical diseases that run in Florida deer. Not much is understood about why the deer have these diseases, Wisely said.
“Sometimes we see big 
jumps,” Wisely said of the disease’s spread, speciﬁ  cally throughout the East Coast.
She said the disease is 
spreading because infected deer are being imported into uninfected states so people can hunt them. When deer farmers 
sell and shift animals from state 
to state, they can spread the dis-ease as well.
Physical features that indi-
cate a deer is infected include malnutrition, saliva pouring out of the deer’s mouth and a confused look on its face, she said.Hunters urged not to 
bring infected deer from other states
RESEARCH
CHLOE STRADINGER

Dr. David Freeman still remem-
bers putting Black Bart to sleep.
The black stallion suffered from 
major complications after surgery 
to manage the colic that strangled 
parts of his small intestine. 
Black Bart’s death inspired Free-
man, a professor of large animal 
surgery at the UF College of Veteri-nary Medicine, to create a grading system to determine if horses with colic caused by small intestinal strangulation actually need parts of their intestines removed.
“To this day, I strongly believe if 
I had not resected it he would have done ﬁ  ne,” Freeman said. “I know he would have done ﬁ  ne now.”
Freeman and a team of research-ers collected data at UF and the 
University of Illinois on 35 cases 
from 1996 to 2011.
They came up 
with a subjective 
grading system that involves sur-geons evaluat-ing the color and movement of a 
piece of intestine 
after it’s released from strangula-
tion.
Sparing horses from removal 
saves owners money and horses from complications, he said.
Ali Unger-Fink, a 20-year-old UF 
elementary education junior and 
equestrian team member, has had 
several horses get various types of colic. Her family owns a ranch with 30 horses in Southwest Ranches.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely something that’s 
deﬁ  nitely a worry among all own-ers,” Unger-Fink said.
The research was published in

Will Muschamp looks down the ﬁ  eld during Florida’s 42-21 loss to Alabama on Sept. 20 at Bryant-Denny Stadium.
MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Following a bye week for 
Florida, coach Will Muschamp 
and company turn their attention 
to their next test: a matchup in 
Neyland Stadium facing longtime Southeastern Conference Eastern Division rival Tennessee. 
The Gators’ last outing was a 
42-21 beat down, suffered at the hands of the No. 3 Alabama Crim-son Tide, in which the 645 yards given up on defense was the most 
of any team in Florida football his-
tory.
The biggest criticism following 
the loss was the play of quarter-
back Jeff Driskel, who went 9 of 25 
for 93 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. 
Despite their poor perfor-
mance, Muschamp said his conﬁ  -
dence levels remains high, and he 
takes the heat from the Florida fan base with stride. 
“That’s part of it. He under-
stands that,” the fourth-year 
head coach said. “I don’t know if 
physically or mentally there’s any 
tougher kid that I’ve been around. He takes the heat and understands that comes with the territory.”
Driskel said the bye week came 
at an opportune time, and in the extra week he got to work with his 
receivers to develop more chemis-
try within the group.
“I think we got a lot of good on 
good action and I think that helps 
out a lot when you see a higher 
level of competition,” Driskel said. “We really didn’t do too much differently, trying to hone in on some route concepts, make 
sure we know what we’re doing, 
make sure we are getting our eyes to the right spots and we’re look-ing at signals.”
Despite Driskel’s struggles 
against the Crimson Tide’s front seven and secondary, Muschamp made it clear that there will not be a change in play-calling in terms 
of executing less passing plays for 
Driskel on Saturday. 
He also said that there is no 
plan for a two-quarterback system 
with true freshman Treon Harris 
at this point in the season, as some speculated following the loss in Tuscaloosa. Muchamp said Mon-day that Driskel took the majority 
of the ﬁ  rst-team snaps at practice 
last week.Perhaps the most impressive 
statistical category for the Vol de-fense is on third down.
Tennessee leads the confer-
ence and the nation in third-down 
conversion defense, holding op-
ponents to get the ﬁ  rst down just 20.8 percent of the time on third down.
As for Tennesse’s offense, it 
all starts with senior quarterback Justin Worley, who has drastically improved this season as opposed to year’s past. 
Worley ranks sixth in the SEC 
in passing average per game, ac-counting for 246 yards in the air per contest through four games. 
The Gators secondary, which 
has looked underwhelming against both Kentucky and Ala-bama, will be rotating different personnel this week as they pre-
pare for Worley and the Vol of-
fense.
“Brian (Poole’s) repping some 
in the nickel. Duke Dawson’s rep-
ping some at the safety position,” 
Muschamp said. 
“You know, between Jalen and 
Quincy at corner, trying to ﬁ  nd the right combination there and 
continuing to rep Marcus in the 
nickel and at safety as well,”

UF comes off bye week

Alligator Writer @icohenb 
In 2012, Maddy Monserez did not 
start a single match.
Nonetheless, the then-sophomore 
prepared, worked hard and stayed 
ready. Eventually, it paid off.
Monserez — originally a walk-on 
for UF  — led Florida past Tulsa in the 
ﬁ  rst round of the 2012 NCAA Tourna-
ment that year, ﬁ  nishing with a match-high 16 digs.
So far this season, Monserez has 
started just six of UF’s 11 matches.
But that has not stopped her from 
making an impact for the Gators in one way or another.
No. 9 Florida has an abundance of 
physical talent, like freshman Rhamat Alhassan’s 37-inch vertical, sopho-more Alex Holston’s strong arm and 
junior Mackenzie Dagostino’s effec-Monserez, Pole leading 
Florida volleyball defenseZOOP’S SCOOP
The guy who follows the guy that suc-
ceeds “the guy” is always the best guy to be.
Let me explain.
In just 12 seasons, Steve Spurrier ce-
mented himself into college football’s his-
tory books after leading Florida to 122 wins, six Southeastern Conference championships and one national title.
Now imagine having to follow that per-
formance.
Poor Ron Zook never stood a chance.In retrospect, Zook really wasn’t that ter-
rible despite his reputation in Gainesville. 
He garnered a .622 winning percentage 
in three years as Florida’s head coach and recruited notable Gator talents such as Chris Leak and Dallas Baker.
In fact, much of Urban Meyer’s 2006 na-
tional championship squad was comprised of Zook’s recruits. So what’s with 
all the hate for “the Zooker?”
Well, he was the 
guy that succeeded “the guy,” also known as Steve 
Spurrier in this 
case.
Barring a couple 
immediate SEC crowns and at least a bid for the national title, Zook stood little to no 
chance surviving at Florida. 
When the bar is set too high, even moder-
ate success is considered failure.
Actually, in some cases, if you have a 
different name from “the guy” then you al-
ready have failed. 
Remember the banners hanging around 
Gainesville calling for Zook’s job the day he Standards high following success

“What (Monserez) expressed 
was, ‘I may not be playing now, 
but I’m gonna keep working 
hard because at some point, 
when this team needs me, I’m 
gonna be ready.’”
Mary Wise
UF coachtive jump serve.
But UF’s other strengths lay not in its 
physical gifts but in the contributions from 
its players found slightly further down on 
the depth chart.
“Maddy came to us as a walk on with 
limited playing time given to her her first 
year,” Wise said. “What she expressed was, 
‘I may not be playing now, but I’m gonna keep working hard because at some point when this team needs me, I’m gonna be ready.’
“And in the (2012) NCAA tournament, 
she had the best match of any of us.”
While Florida attracts some of the top-
rated volleyball recruits around the nation, 
perhaps where it excels most is with its 
player development and walk-ons.
Despite limited playing time this season, 
Monserez has a team-best .985 reception percentage to go along with her 67 digs, 15 
assists and two service aces.
When comparing her current stats to the 
the previous season, the Orlando native has 
almost surpassed her 113 digs in 74 sets 
from 2013.
“It isn’t just the DNA. It isn’t, you know, 
just some luck there in how tall you are,” 
coach Mary Wise said of Monserez. “You can’t control her height… and the prototype 
things you look for in volleyball. But you 
can’t find a greater heart. And thus, she’s our senior captain. She is the heartbeat of our team.”
When Florida scouted Monserez in high 
school, it saw a selfless player who dived for every ball and sacrificed herself to keep a play alive. 
That mindset stood out to Wise.
“Before she had the volleyball IQ that 
she has now… she was the player who just 
threw her body in front of the ball to keep it from landing,” Wise said. 
“What she showed just with pure guts 
got her on the floor early. Now it’s trans-ferred into her skill set and the plays she makes.”
From walk-on to defensive captain  Mon-
serez has taken on a much larger role than when she first joined the team.
Senior starter Holly Pole was also a walk-
on when she joined the Gators in Spring 
2011. 
Now she’s considered one of the South-
eastern Conference’s top liberos and leads 
Florida with 137 digs.
Monserez and Pole are listed at 5-foot-6 
and 5-foot-7, respectively, with no outstand-ing physical attributes to boast. But the two seniors are two of the most respected lead-ers on the team, with Wise often dubbing Pole the team’s on court coach.
“We’re at the point now where if Holly 
misses a dig in practice or in a game, you see it on her face. She’s mad. She expects (to dig) every ball,” Wise said. “The confidence that she’s playing with and the acceptance 
of the roles by Maddy and Taylor (Unroe), 
we are so lucky to have what we have.“
While Florida often relies on its taller 
players, leaping ability and strong offen-sive performances to dominate some of its 
opponents, Wise calls on other players for 
reasons that’s aren’t always visible on the court.
“It’s the senior leadership and the teach-
ing skills those seniors have taken (on),” Wise said. “We went through the growing pains when they were young, but now we’re reaping the benefits of this senior class.”ida’s struggling secondary 
and the Tennessee’s wide re-ceiving corps will be one to 
watch Saturday. The leader of 
the Volunteers’ group is Mar-quez North, who is averaging 47 receiving yards per game 
and has three touchdowns on 
the year. 
Redshirt sophomore Jason 
Croom leads the team in aver-age yards per reception with 
16.  
“They’ve really improved 
themselves at the receiver 
position,” Muschamp said. “Marquez North and Jason Croom are both 6-4 plus guys that are very difficult match ups in coverage down the 
field they take probably 8 to 
10 shots in the game.”
Despite losing to Alabama 
two weeks ago, Florida still has a chance to win the SEC 
East and represent the divi-
sion in Atlanta. 
The next step in doing that 
comes this week as they take 
on the Vols.
“All the goals are still there, 
got a lot of football to play ev-
erything’s out in front of us, let’s go get it,” Muschamp 
said. “They’re all must wins. 
When has it ever changed?”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014

volley , from page 13MuSchAMP , 
from page 13Tennessee improved 
at wide receiver position this seasonZook, Muschamp followed ‘the guy’
took over?
It’s not like he even had a shab-
by coaching resume heading into 
the position. 
Zook had stints with three NFL 
teams and six Power Five college 
programs — including a four-year 
gig with the Gators under Spur-
rier.
Still, he wasn’t good enough. 
How could he be? 
He wasn’t Spurrier.
So when Urban Meyer strolled 
into town, all he had to do was not 
be Zook. 
Step one: accomplished.
Step two for Meyer was to at 
least show the illusion of progress 
by accomplishing what Zook had trouble doing. 
By defeating Tennessee, Geor-
gia and Florida State all in the same season, Meyer gained more of a fanbase than Zook ever did in his tenure at UF.
Gone was the pressure of fol-
lowing up a legend. All Gator fans wanted at that 
point was someone who wasn’t 
going to pick fights with fraterni-
ty brothers and maybe could beat the important rivals every once in a while.
What they got was more than 
they could possibly imagine.
In just six seasons — half the 
time Spurrier spent in Gainesville — Meyer cranked out 65 wins, 
two SEC championship squads 
and two national titles. 
More importantly, he had se-
cured his place next to Spurrier as 
“the (new) guy.”
So once again Jeremy Foley had 
the task of picking “the guy’s” 
successor and once again he went with a defensive minded coach 
that played defense back in col-
lege but had no prior head coach-ing experience.
Sorry Will Muschamp, but just 
ask Zook how much being the guy after “the guy” sucks.
Or ask Bill O’Brien. Do you 
think he had planned on leaving Penn State after just two seasons? Or do you think the Joe Pater-
no obsessed fanbase up in Happy 
Valley drove O’Brien to ditch col-
lege for the NFL?
You can ask Frank Solich as 
well. He took over the for great 
Tom Osborne at Nebraska in 
1998.
In six seasons, Solich made six 
straight bowl games, including the national title game in 2001. 
However, a Big 12 Championship 
and 58 wins still weren’t enough to last in Lincoln.
Seriously? The guy was hand 
picked by Osborne and still run out of town?
It’s foolish to think Muschamp 
had any real chance at sticking around here at Florida, but maybe 
his successor can without any of 
the absurd pressure and backlash both Muschamp and Zook re-ceived.
So if you’re interested in be-
coming “the (next) guy” for Flor-ida, apply now! After this season, the bar will undoubtedly be low-ered quite a few notches.coluMn , from page 13

UF coach� DEFENSIVE LINEMAN LEON ORR IS OUT, 
LINEBACKER MIKE TAYLOR IS QUESTIONABLE.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Florida offensive line is beginning to shape up again.
Junior left tackle D.J. Humphries — who has not played 
since the first quarter of Florida’s 65-0 win against Eastern 
Michigan due to a bone chip in his ankle — is expected to be 
back for UF’s Saturday matchup against Tennessee, coach Will Muschamp said Monday.
While Humphries was out, redshirt senior Chaz Green 
shifted from right tackle to left tackle, and true freshman Rod Johnson started at right tackle.
“Rod has played well. Chaz has played well. They all will 
play,” Muschamp said. “But if D.J. is ready to go, we’ll put him at the left and then we’ll figure out between Chaz and 
Rod. Obviously, Chaz will be a guy that would probably start 
if we had the game today, but we want to see how the week goes.”
Senior guard Trenton Brown, who left Florida’s game against Alabama with a high ankle sprain, will also be ready to go when the Gators travel to Knoxville, Tenn., this weekend.
“He’s really coming along and playing well for us,” Mus-
champ said of the 6-foot-8 Brown. “Certainly losing him the other day hurt a little bit as far as some of the movement we got in the run game. He’s done a nice job with protection. He kicked out and played right tackle against Kentucky a little 
bit. But really, again, his biggest issue’s been consistency in his 
performance, down in, down out, position in, possession out, and that’s where I really think he’s made some strides.”
Defense banged up: Defensive lineman Leon Orr — who 
had his knee scoped last week after having a small tear in his meniscus — will not play against Tennessee on Saturday, Muschamp said.
Through three games this season, the redshirt senior has 
recorded 14 total tackles, including two for a loss and a forced 
fumble.
With Orr out against the Volunteers, Jon Bullard will shift 
from the defensive end position to defensive tackle and Joey 
Ivie will see more snaps at defensive end.
Muschamp also said true freshmen Gerald Willis and Tav-
en Bryan would receive more playing time on Saturday.
Linebacker Mike Taylor (knee) is listed as “questionable to 
doubtful” for the Tennessee game, Muschamp said. Taylor, a redshirt senior, is tied for the team lead with 21 total tackles.
Punter back in form: After a subpar 2013 season, punter 
Kyle Christy is making the most of his opportunities this year.
Through three contests, the senior is averaging a nation-
best 50.4 yards per punt — 2.5 yards longer than Idaho’s Aus-tin Rehkow, who is second in the country with a 47.8-yard-per-punt average.
Christy struggled to punt effectively in 2013, averaging just 
39.6 yards each time he kicked the ball away. Only two of his 
21 punts last season went at least 50 yards, while 10 of his 16 
punts this year have reached that distance.
“When he’s able to flip the field the way he can, he certainly 
is a huge weapon for us,” Muschamp said. “I think more than 
anything [it’s] confidence. I think the issue is his confidence 
got shook a little bit last year. I think  (special teams coordina-tor) Coleman Hutzler has done a really good job fundamen-tally with him as far as getting back to the basics as opposed to trying to tweak and change his swing every time something 
didn’t go right.”ERICA A. HERNANDEZ

This edition of Gators in the 
NFL is coming to you live from 
Chicago, so it’s only fitting that Jon Bostic leads the pack — even though he and his Bears teammates 
failed to win against the Packers 
on Sunday. Chicago lost to Green Bay 38-17, and the city wept.
The former Gators linebacker 
was caught holding at the start of the fourth quarter but he didn’t contribute much beyond that inci-dent in Chicago on Sunday. 
Murphy catches on: Former 
Florida and current Tampa Bay wide receiver Louis Murphy to-taled 99 yards, with a team-high six receptions as the Buccaneers defeated the Steelers 27-24. 
Sunday was Murphy’s first 
game since being resigned by the Buccaneers after initially being released in the final round of pre-
season cuts.
“It’s just kind of fitting for a lo-
cal guy who loves the Buccaneers,” 
coach Lovie Smith said of Murphy. “While he was out, he stayed in contact with us. He was one of our guys. It says an awful lot about him to come in and be able to con-tribute like that.”  
Safety Major Wright totaled 
nine tackles. Wide receiver Solo-mon Patton rushed once for 19 yards. He returned two punts for 29 yards and two kicks for 45. 
Sturgis, Jenkins excel in Lon-
don: The Dolphins managed a clutch win against the Raiders on Sunday. Miami defeated Oakland 38-14 at Wembley Stadium in London, England. The transatlan-tic flight pushed the entire team, including four former Gators, to perform better. The fresh British 
air led the two most recent Florida 
grads to success. Kicker Caleb St-urgis completed all five extra point attempts. He solidified his quality performance by making a 41-yard field goal. Linebacker Jelani Jen-kins totaled three tackles.
Reed getting healthy: At the 
start of Week 4, the Washington 
Redskins fell to the New York 
Giants 45-14 in Maryland. Jor-dan Reed, who has not competed since suffering a hamstring injury against Houston, sat out again. Coaches are optimistic that the former Gator will be recovered 
and ready to compete next week 
against the Seattle Seahawks. 
On Friday, Redskins coach Jay Gruden told Comcast Sportsnet the former Gators tight end will return to play when the Redskins 
take on the defending NFL cham-
pions on Sunday. 
“He’s still got the hamstring and he’s rehabbing as hard as he can go right now,” Gruden said. “We’re very hopeful that he can 
get back sooner than later. But like 
I said before, those hamstrings are all different.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After a weekend in which 
Florida played in Gainesville 
for the first time since Aug. 24 
and defeated two Southeast-
ern Conference opponents in Georgia and Missouri, the Gators are now more than 
halfway through their regu-
lar-season schedule.
No. 7 Florida sits at 8-2 
thus far this season with a 3-0 SEC record. 
It has eight more games 
to play on its regular season schedule before the SEC tour-nament begins on Nov. 3.
Five of those eight will be 
on the road.
Coach Becky Burleigh 
likes what she has seen out of her team up to this point 
in the year. 
Burleigh said she’s ex-
cited to see how much stron-
ger the Gators can play and 
how much they can still im-
prove as they head down the stretch.
“I think for us, what’s 
pretty exciting about it is that 
we still have a lot of areas to 
grow and we’re still forming chemistry among different pairs of players and positions 
on our team,” Burleigh said. 
“We have a big ceiling 
and I think that the games 
that are coming up are going help push us there.”
Another factor that will 
continue to help Florida down the road is the consis-tently strong play of sopho-
more Savannah Jordan.Jordan was named the 
SEC Offensive Soccer Player 
of the Week on Monday. 
She is the third Gator to 
receive the honor this year, 
along with senior Jillian 
Graff and sophomore Pamela Begic.
Last weekend, Jordan had two goals and one assist as 
Florida defeated Georgia and 
Missouri. 
She has a team-high sev-
en goals this season, which 
is also the third most in the 
SEC. Her 45 shots and 25 shots on goal are both team highs.Last season, as a fresh-
man, Jordan was named an All-American, National Rookie of the Year and SEC Offensive Player of the Year 
and was named to both the 
All-SEC First Team and the SEC All-Freshman Team.
Her resume speaks for it-
self.
Burleigh knows how 
much trouble Jordan causes for opposing teams with her talents and her skillset.
“She’s tough to contain,” 
Burleigh said of Jordan. 
“In a 90-minute game, 
she’s going to get her chanc-es. I think teams know that and the fact that she’s still being able to do that as a marked player is even more 
impressive.”
Jordan will look to contin-
ue to cause havoc among her 
opposing defenses for the re-mainder of this season. 
She and her teammates 
will need to be on the top of their game if the Gators want to have a strong second half of the year.
Florida has quality teams 
that they will face in the com-ing weeks and the majority of them will be on the road. 
But for the Gators, they 
are excited to embrace the 
challenge.
“We are really looking for-
ward to playing great com-
petition because that great competition is what usually 
elevates us,” Burleigh said. 
“For us there’s a long way to go.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2014

Only one Gator is still in the running to 
win the singles bracket in the 2014 Saint 
Francis Health System ITA Men’s All-American Championship. 
Junior Gordon Watson defeated North-
western’s Strong Kirchheimer in straight sets (7-6 (4), 6-3). Sophomore Elliott Orkin 
lost to Felipe Rios from Baylor University 
(7-6 (4), 6-3).
Orkin was the No. 16 seed after winning 
the recent Southeastern Conference Fall Classic title. 
Watson will play the 
second qualifying round Tuesday morning. 
If he wins, Watson will advance to the 
third and last qualifying round, before en-tering the main draw. 
The main draw will be held at the Uni-
versity of Tulsa from Thursday through Monday. 
Each of the singles semifinalists, doubles 
finalists and consolation champions will 
win a seat in the USTA/ITA National In-
door Intercollegiate Championships Nov. 6-9 in Flushing, N.Y.
Sophomore Maxx Lipman lost in the first 
round of the qualifying matches to Ole Miss’ Stefan Lindmark (2-6, 7-6(5), 6-4). Captains Lipman, Watson and Orkin will participate in the qualifying doubles rounds starting today. 
Redshirt freshmen Oliver Landert and 
Josh Wardell ended the ITA tournament with consolation wins, after losing round
