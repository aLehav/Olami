LAKEVILLE, Minn. (AP) — Rescue crews were using fire 
hoses to douse an angry swarm of bees after a fatal crash that 
involved a semitrailer carrying about 17 million of the insects.
Authorities say a truck hauling 7,000 bee hives was involved 
in the four-vehicle crash Monday on Interstate 35 near Lakev-ille, about 35 miles south of Minneapolis.
Minnesota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske says one 
person died and another person was airlifted to a hospital.
The hives housed roughly 17 million bees and were bound 
for Bauer Honey in northwestern Minnesota. It's unclear how many bees got loose, but many emergency workers were stung.

� LOWE SAID HE VIEWS HIS JOB AS A CHALLENGE 
AND OPPORTUNITY.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Less than a week into his term, Mayor Craig Lowe said he 
is expecting some of the toughest budget decisions in decades. 
Nevertheless, he still has high hopes for Gainesville by plan-
ning to improve the economic, environmental and neighbor-hood development. 
Lowe’s first goal is to prepare for the upcoming budget dis-
cussions, which he is doing by evaluating programs’ costs and 
benefits, he said.
He also wants to partner with the Alachua County School 
Board to “see if we can work to improve student achievement 
in the school system.”
While Lowe said he can’t please everybody, especially with 
tough problems, there are benefits to being mayor, too.
“You do get to make a difference in the community that 
you love,” he said. 
Lowe said he views his job as “a challenge and an opportu-
nity to serve the community,” and as a way to practice what he learned from being a city commissioner.
“I can’t imagine what it would be like assuming the office 
of mayor without serving as commissioner,” he said.Craig Lowe sworn in as Gainesville mayor

Enforcement internal investigation of 
the incident.The judgment gives UF the ability to 
complete its own internal affairs inves-

Lamar Abel, a former walk-on defensive 
lineman for the Gators, died Saturday after 
an apparent seizure.
After participating in a roadside cleanup 
with his fraternity brothers at Southwest 62nd Boulevard on Saturday afternoon, the 21-year-old reported feeling chest pains around 7 p.m. 
He suffered a seizure at his home in 
Campus Lodge Apartments, according to Michael Bowie, an adviser to Abel’s frater-nity, Omega Psi Phi.
Bowie said one of Abel’s fraternity 
brothers called the paramedics and tried to resuscitate him before help arrived. He was taken to Shands Hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after midnight. Bowie remembered Abel as a funny per-
son who truly cared about people.  
“He was more than just a student to 
me,” Bowie said. “He was a friend.”
When friends learned of Abel’s death, 
they arrived at Campus Lodge Apartments to hold a prayer vigil in the parking lot, according to 
Kimone Codner, a close friend to Abel through the National Panhellenic Council.
“He touched a lot of 
people while here,” Codner said.

pha, named him Mr. Congeniality during a men’s appreciation event. Abel’s sense of Former Gator dies at 21

� THE MUSICAL CHAIRS PROJECT RAISED ABOUT 
$2,500 FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS.
By NICOLE SALZMAN 
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
About 200 people bought hand-painted chairs and donated 
money to hear live music in support of local arts programs Sat-
urday night in downtown Gainesville. 
The Musical Chairs Project raised about $2,500 for the 
Friends of Alachua County Public Schools Elementary Arts 
Programs Fund, which is coordinated by two retired Alachua 
County teachers. The event consisted of an auction followed by a concert. 
Fourteen revamped chairs were sold during the auction, 
which drew a crowd of about 100.
UF’s College of Fine Arts was about to discard the old chairs, 
but Katie Levy, UF graphic design alumna and co-organizer of the event, asked local artists to paint them for the auction in-stead. Levy used Facebook to contact bands and arranged for 
the venue space.
“It was a lot of work but very rewarding,” said Levy, adding 
that she’s been involved in the Alachua County public school 
arts programs since she started school.
About 100 more people came out to hear bands Levek and 
Umoja Orchestra and singer Ricky Kendall, band member of Paxico Via Mexico.
Anna Walters, a UF sophomore, said she came 
to see Levek after enjoying the band’s music earli-
er in the week at Flaco’s Cuban Bakery. She didn’t 
know it was a benefit concert but said that supporting the fund 
was an added bonus.  
Sue Johnson, a retired art teacher who co-formed the fund, 
said she was glad to see different generations come to the con-cert and donate.
“With all that goes on in the world, it’s pretty cool to be con-
nected through the arts,” Johnson said. 
Gail and Jim Moss, who purchased a mosaic-decorated chair 
for $300, attended the concert after to continue to show their support of the arts.
“These young people are doing amazing things,” Gail Moss 
said. “I have to support that.”
The remaining 13 chairs sold for between $50 and $300 each.
Johnson started the fund after the school board was forced to cut the music and arts curriculum in half in 2008 because of budget cuts. The fund, which is also coordinated by retired mu-sic teacher Cheryl Poe, has contributed $1,000 to each art and 
music program in 25 elementary schools in Alachua County, 
totaling $50,000.
Johnson said their goal is to start a $100,000 endowment to 
secure the future of the elementary arts and music programs.
“We want to see the program grow and keep a high level of 
awareness in the community,” she said. “The arts open you up to so many different things, and it’s connecting all of us.” 4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 25, 2010

a press release. 
After a nine-month planning process by a 25-member cabinet 
of university and hospital leaders, 
the plan, known as “Forward Togeth-er,” was formed to increase research 
potential for the 
university.
“[W]e want to 
become a national model for edu-cation in the health science profes-sion,” David S. Guzick, head of UF 
& Shands health system, wrote in 
the release. 
Future plans include the creation 
of an electronic medical record sys-
tem, the building of a Shands Hospi-tal for Children and Women and the 
construction of primary care offices 
throughout the area.

TALLAHASSEE — A financial watchdog 
group Monday said Florida’s new budget con-
tains nearly $61 million in “turkeys” that Gov. Charlie Crist should veto.
Florida TaxWatch issued its annual list of 
spending projects either not requested by Crist or state agencies or which had bypassed usual selection processes. Most, but not all, of the 41 turkeys are local projects.
About half appeared in neither the House 
nor Senate versions of the budget. They were added later by conference committees or budget chairmen for the two chambers, Rep. 
David Rivera, R-Miami, and Sen. JD Alexan-
der, R-Lake Wales, including several for their hometowns.
A variety of local transportation projects 
account for most of the turkeys. There’s also $8.5 million for a Florida A & M University pharmacy and rural health care facility in Crestview and $1.7 million for a senior center, complete with domino room, in Miami’s Little 
Havana.
Other examples are $150,000 for emergen-cy generators in the Miami suburb of Golden 
Beach, nearly $500,000 for a canal rowing facility in 
Brevard and Indian River counties and a series of mu-seum and historic projects including $250,000 for the Holocaust Documentation 
and Education Center’s rail car renovation in Broward County.
Crist has through Friday to sign or veto 
the $70.4 budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1. He also has the power to veto line items such as the turkeys.
This year’s list is longer than the $15 million 
worth of turkeys that TaxWatch, which draws much of its backing from business interests, identified a year ago. It’s still much shorter, though, than lists of between $200 million and $300 million for seven of the past 10 years.
One reason is the bad economy that has de-
pleted state coffers in the past three years and another is a new emphasis within the Legis-
lature on making the budgeting process more 
transparent.
� THE GAME LASTED TWO-
AND-A-HALF HOURS.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
The zombie epidemic has in-
fected a Gainesville apartment 
complex.
The District apartments on 
Southwest 62nd Boulevard was home to a Humans vs. Zombies game Saturday night. About 30 people participated in the game that resembled an elaborate version 
of tag.
Mario Bartee, a fourth-year 
nursing student and community 
ambassador for The District, said he organized the Humans vs. Zom-bies game to keep residents active and social.
“I don’t have enough time to re-ally interact with it at school,” Bar-tee said. “I figured a lot of students don’t have time to do it at school, so they can come out here and experi-
ence it.”
Fans of “Resident 
Evil” or “Land of the 
Dead,”  enjoy experi-encing a zombie inva-
sion, Bartee said.
“It’s more of a thrill,” he said. 
“Creating it as a game, you can cre-ate your own rules and have fun with it.”
At the midway point of the 
game, according to Nathalie May-
orga, an English senior, humans 
were winning. But by the end of the two-and-a-half-hour game, zombies outnumbered humans, and only a few human survivors remained.
Erik Cundiff, a human who sur-
vived through the game, hid, ran and stayed alone to evade the zom-bies. Cundiff, a Santa Fe College sophomore, wanted to play UF’s zombie game during the spring se-mester but couldn’t. 
Although not a resident at The 
District, he said he came because the game sounded like fun.
“I think everyone wonders 
what happens when you die,” said Cundiff. “I think this is something where people say, ‘I can come back as a zombie and eat brains.’”STATETax group identifies wasteful spending in budget

83 TOTAL VOTES43% YES57% NOThursday’s question: Have you paid your tuition yet?Today’s question: Do you think the UPD officers should face criminal charges for shooting?Imagine a world where all you had to do to get away with 
shooting a disabled man in the face was say you felt en-
dangered and the law would be on your side.
State Attorney Bill Cervone announced Friday that the 
University Police Department officers involved in the March 2 shooting of Kofi Adu-Brempong will not face criminal charges for their actions.
We cannot say that we find this shocking because the 
only people who witnessed the events at Adu-Brempong’s apartment were the officers and Adu-Brempong himself, but we would be lying if we said we are not disappointed in the state’s decision.
When police showed up to the apartment in Corry Village, 
they were responding to reports of screaming coming from inside. Adu-Brempong was alone and in a state of mental distress. Cervone said police decided to force entry into the apartment because they were concerned about the doctoral candidate’s safety.
This would have been all right if police were working to 
protect the Ghanaian student and diffuse the problem, but somehow their initial concern for his safety ended in the man being shot in the face by an assault rifle. He is still recover-ing from his injuries and being fed through a tube. It is hard to imagine that doing this to a man who walks with a cane could ever be legally justified.
When violence is committed against a police officer, the 
perpetrator is dead to rights. Protecting the safety of our police officers is a righteous cause, but turn the tables and somehow we are expected to accept a police officer’s word on whether a shooting is warranted.
When it comes to the law, police officers are given a blank 
check, but that does not mean there is nothing we can do to keep this from happening again. 
UF President Bernie Machen still has to decide how the 
university is going to respond to the shooting, possibly changing university policy on how the University Police De-partment responds to calls like the one to Adu-Brempong’s apartment.
We think there needs to be more oversight and control 
governing when police officers are justified in shooting someone and a way to accurately review incidents like this without having to take an officer’s word at face value. There is a forward-facing camera in most squad cars that records officers whenever they pull someone over. Measures like that protect  officers and citizens and make sure everything is done by the book.
Cameras do not lie; we would feel better about the UPD 
officers getting off the hook if there was a way for us to see an unbiased account of what led up to their decision to shoot Adu-Brempong.
University police departments may have a good deal in 
common with other law enforcement agencies, but they are 
also unique because they make sure we can get our educa-
tion in a safe environment. 
UF is not just another piece of land. People send their chil-
dren here, people grow up here, and maybe once in a while 
people go through something where they just want to scream in their apartment.
We just want to be assured that the UPD knows that, and 
until it proves that to us we will not be satisfied with how 
this situation is being handled.Disappointing 
Decision
UPD officers not charged
A couple of weeks ago, at the tender age of 19, I fi-
nally got my Florida driver’s license. After a three-year saga of excuses and missed opportunities, I 
finally sucked it up and studied hard enough to pass  — 
despite running over a cone and failing my first attempt. While pretty much all college students and young drivers can relate to the experience, I feel like I have a unique view of the whole process.
I did not grow up in America, and the idea that it was 
imperative I get my driver’s license was a foreign one. I had always used public transportation or asked my par-
ents for a ride while never giving much thought to how 
important it was for me to drive on my own. 
After I got tired of the stares when I lugged my bags of 
Publix groceries onto the bus and of my friends and my 
parents making fun me, I was finally goaded into getting 
one. 
Yet as I was sitting in the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
which is perhaps the least accommodating place on Earth, 
I began to realize two greater truths behind this event. The first was that I am becoming an adult. In our culture, at-taining a driver’s license has been inexorably tied to adult-hood and becoming a full-fledged member of society. I remember when people would ask for my driver’s license as a form of identification, and I would be forced to hand over my scratched and ratty Gator 1 Card. 
Often, the look on their faces seemed to question my 
own maturity and abilities as a person. I feel that, with-out a driver’s license, people are without power and seen by society as immature and unable to make decisions for themselves.
As I sat longer in the DMV, I began to realize an even 
bigger truth about driver’s licenses and their purpose in our culture, beyond simply making the roads safe for all drivers. In essence, they tie us even closer to the automobile and per-petuate the American car culture, a culture that has contributed to the United States being the largest con-sumer of oil worldwide and is seen by some as adding to global climate change. 
By getting my license, I would 
be recognized by society as achieving a milestone and as an adult. Without it, I feel like I would have 
been marginalized and not fully accepted by a soci-
ety that places specific emphasis on the ability to drive. 
American consumer culture is closely tied to the automo-bile and people give their tacit consent to such a culture by getting their driver’s licenses. While the push for cleaner 
automobiles and an all-around “green” lifestyle is gaining 
steam, it will take a lot more effort to wean ourselves off 
the gas pump and bring change to the status quo. 
Regardless of your views on climate change, it is unde-
niable that the cars on America’s roads affect the environ-ment and us. Beyond the wide-ranging effects created by the cars themselves, it is not a far jump to view the ongo-ing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as the dirty by-product of America’s car culture. 
By making a driver’s license a requisite part of adult-
hood and life advancement, American society is placing heavy emphasis on automobiles and keeps them on our roads. While everything must be done to find a cleaner, more sustainable future, we must realize that severing ties to our gas-burning automobiles will be a monumental task.

Letter to the Editor
Adult entertainment industry veteran 
explains .xxx domain 
As a 20-year veteran of the adult enter-
tainment industry, I can tell you this isn’t 
about controlling access to adult material. 
This is about money, plain and simple.
The company asking for the top-level 
domain is ICM Registry, which has no 
background and no affiliation with the 
very industry that this TLD would affect.
The industry does not want the .xxx 
TLD. We have made this very clear to the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN. It may be the 
only thing that the adult industry, the 
Christian right and the Bush administra-tion will ever agree on.
The .xxx TLD would do nothing to con-
trol porn on the Internet.Children could be protected in a much 
simpler way, namely by using a .kids do-
main with a strict oversight committee 
and browsers that parents can set to access only that domain. But let’s face it, there isn’t nearly as much money in that.
ICM Registry has gone so far as to try 
to bribe key adult-industry members and organizations for support. 
The company offered our trade asso-
ciation $8 per domain sold in exchange 
for our support. When it was clear that we 
were going to turn them down, ICM Regis-try had enough people join the trade asso-ciation to sway the vote in ICM Registry’s 
favor. 
The trade association changed the vot-
ing rules, giving a vote only to members 
who had been members for three months or more.
When you consider that ICM Registry 
would go to that length to get our approv-al, you have to ask yourself why. 
It’s because the main criteria for en-
acting a domain of this sort, according to 
ICANN rules, is the support of the indus-
try it affects. 
So far, ICM Registry has been unable 
to show evidence for that support, and ICANN has voted it down three times. But 
ICM Registry has a lot of money invested 
in this, so they keep suing and keep com-ing back.
Hopefully we can shut this bad idea 
down once and for all.
Finally, as a pornographer I assure you 
we don’t want your kids getting our prod-uct. We are fighting tooth and nail to stop 
most of the free, adult material on the 
Internet because it is in violation of our 
copyrights. 
We do this to make money, and we 
don’t make money when people steal our 
content and “share” it.
Nor do we target your children. We 
target people with credit cards, and your 
children don’t have credit cards. There is no return on investment if I target my con-
tent to your children. 
Please help me keep my product out of 
the hands of children by supporting the 
enforcement of copyright laws and target-
ing sites that make stolen, adult content 
available to anyone for free.

created a brand-new party that represents all students, not just the lucky few.  This new party, the Student Alliance party, immediately got to work by opposing the new Reitz Union student fee. We felt that in times of great economic 
hardship, the Unite Party was wrong to pass the buck on to 
the Student Body. 
The overwhelming rejection of the Reitz Union Fee on 
Election Day and the election of 20 members of the Student Alliance party to the Student Senate sent a clear message 
that the students supported our vision for an open and fair 
Student Government. While the election proved that it was the average student voter, not the ubiquitous SG official, who had the final say in things, the spring campaign also 
brought out the very worst of SG. Our party was equated 
to the Nazi party in anonymous fliers that were distributed around bus stops. All the while we were being accused of being Zion-ists and having the blood of Pales-
tinians on our hands. 
The cowardly perpetrators of these mendacious rumors 
failed to mention that one of our senators is the president 
of Justice for Palestine, and many of our members are of 
the Jewish faith and have lost relatives in the Holocaust.  
Undeterred by these attacks, we redoubled our efforts at cleaning up SG and made sure that the budget for the up-coming fiscal year was transparent.
It is against the backdrop of such significant progress 
that three Student Alliance party senators and three non-students decided, without any forewarning, to reconstitute the “Progress Party” last Tuesday in Senate. They said we were being dilatory for questioning cabinet appointees for 
an average of three minutes to ensure qualified individu-
als received the positions and that the appointments of the Student Body president weren’t being simply rubber-stamped. 
They dragged out of the gutter all those nasty episodes 
from the previous campaign cycle, and most disturbingly, they claimed we had abandoned the values of the origi-nal Progress Party. The vision of “progress through par-ticipation,” for example changing Student Government by 
making every student a stakeholder has been at the core 
of our new party. Our graphics and media, organizational outreach and grassroots campaigning all drew from the Progress Party and had members of the original Progress Party at the helm.
This past semester has witnessed the emergence of a 
credible new movement in Student Government that seeks to end decades of corruption and student indifference. Let’s not piss that away.

ALUMNUS.

A 21-year-old Gainesville man 
drowned in a pool at the Bellamy 
Forge condominium complex shortly 
before noon Saturday. 
The victim, Wayne Lawrence II, 
who was visiting a friend, swam into the deep end of the complex’s pool 
and sunk beneath the surface, ac-
cording to Tscharna Senn, spokes-woman for the Gainesville Police Department. 
“Everyone was in the pool having 
fun,” she said. “They didn’t actually realize he was underwater.” 
Once those at the scene realized 
Lawrence was underwater, they 
pulled him out and tried to  resusci-tate using him CPR, Senn said. 
Responding to a call made by 
someone on the scene, EMS took over 
upon arrival and transported Law-rence to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
Although the investigation is on-
going and no autopsy has been sub-mitted, Senn said the investigating officers do not believe the incident is 
drug- or alcohol-related. 
Senn also said the po-
lice have no indication that any suspicious ac-
tivity or foul play was involved. 
Investigators are not currently 
considering suicide as a possibility, she said. 
According to Lawrence’s Face-
book page, he was an alumnus of 
Santa Fe College and Buchholz High 
School.

The day after the fire, the air still smelled 
of charred wood. Neighbors gathered around 
the fenced-off building and stared quietly.
The roof of the two-story building was 
gone, fallen walls and debris lie all over the 
ground. Looking at the surrounding trees, 
observers could discern where the flames had licked the leaves and left them brown.
The 16-apartment building at Paddock 
Club Apartments on Fort Clarke Boulevard was severely burned late Wednesday. It was determined to be a “total loss” by Alachua County Fire Rescue officials.
“It’s pretty scary. We saw the smoke across 
town on 34th [Avenue],” said Luis Vargas, a resident of Paddock Club Apartments. “[My neighbor] said she didn’t even open her win-dows and the whole room was glowing or-ange.”
Each of the building’s residents, 28 adults 
and seven children in all, were displaced from their homes. Members of both the Ala-chua County Fire Rescue and Gainesville Fire 
Rescue arrived on the scene to fight the blaze. 
But their efforts were not sufficient to quickly quench the fire, as virtually all possessions in-side the building were destroyed. No one was 
hurt, however, and all residents have been ac-
counted for, said ACFR spokeswoman Carol Davis.
The State Fire Marshal’s office sent officials 
down to aid in the investigation process, she 
said. The marshals have estimated the dam-
age  to be around  $1.5 to $2 million. Although 
investigators continue to look into the cause of the fire, they know it began on the second floor, Davis said.
Many apartment complexes in town have 
joined to help the Salvation Army and Red Cross in their relief efforts, alerting their resi-dents to the displaced families’ needs.
E-mails are circulating that call for linens, 
bedding and pillows, food, clothing of all sizes, furniture and monetary donations to be brought to Paddock Club Apartments main office. To help, contact the complex manager, 
Becky Sands, at 352-333-9922.LOCAL

Caleb Burton was looking for plants 
for his landscaping project. Every year 
for his wife’s birthday, he does garden-ing work. This year, he went to the Ala-chua County Master Gardener Plant 
Sale.
The program, a volunteer-based or-
ganization that helps the public with 
plant care, uses the plant sale to fund its 
projects, according to Howard Leinart, a 
master gardener.
About 4,500 of the 4,700 plants at the 
Alachua County Master Gardener Plant Sale were sold Saturday. The plants were grown by about 95 master garden-ers, and about 80 master gardeners vol-unteered at the plant sale, according to 
Wendy Wilber, a horticulture extension 
agent with the Alachua County Agricul-tural Extension Office.
The plants were sold cheaper than 
at local plant stores, said Burton, a Gainesville carpenter.
“We’re definitely getting a lot more 
for our buck than other places,” he said.
The Master Gardener program is part 
of UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultur-al Sciences Extension Service.
Volunteering as a master gardener is 
free, outside of the $160 in materials and 75 hours of volunteer time, Leinart said.
Leinart, who became a master gar-
dener in 2007, enjoys serving the public.
“I retired and my 
wife said that I need to get the hell out of the house,” he said. 
“It’s good. I like giving to the public, sharing my knowledge.”
Leinart said one of the primary costs 
covered by the plant sale is the Master 
Gardener’s school program.
The school program, according to 
Bob Fennell, a master gardener involved 
with the program, teaches about 50 kids each from about half of Alachua Coun-ty’s elementary schools how to garden.Master gardeners sell

humor, motivation and good nature 
earned him the title, she said.
An official candlelight vigil was 
organized on Turlington Plaza on Sunday at 8 p.m. in memory of the athlete.
“It was helpful for people to get 
out their emotion,” Codner said.
The former athlete, who also 
played for football for Blanche Ely High School in his hometown of Sun-rise, was known as quite the cook to those close to him, often offering to prepare meals on Sundays for his fra-
ternity brothers and neighbors.
The 6-2, 263-pound Abel wore the 
No. 62 jersey, dressed for 10 games and saw playing time when the 
Gators played the Citadel in 2008. He 
was named  Scout Team Player of the 
Week prior to the game against South 
Carolina in 2008. Abel also made the 
SEC Fall Academic Honor Roll in 
2008-2009, according to UF archives.He had a seizure at home

charges of one count of second-degree aggra-
vated assault and one count of third-degree resisting arrest with violence.
In his statement, Cervone acknowledged 
UPD’s right to enter the residence, as the of-ficers had a legitimate reason to believe Adu-Brempong might have hurt himself inside.
“Had that action not been taken and had 
he or others come to harm because of inac-tion,” he said, “. . . an equal or stronger issue as to the propriety of police inaction would doubtless have been raised.”
Cervone added that it is not his place to 
review crisis procedure, just the legality of the action. He said questions of policy were 
best left to community discussion.He also found no reason to charge the of-
ficers for their use of force, citing that “No 
one else, civilian or otherwise, was in a po-
sition to hear anything directly relevant to 
those events other than 
Adu-Brempong,” adding 
that the student’s cred-ibility was tarnished by his apparent unstable mental health.
Under Florida law, 
anyone has the right to use deadly force against 
someone who appears threatening. Cervone reasoned the police reports were concurrent with that law.
Cervone ended his statement with a call 
to put the issue to rest.UPD , from page 1AroundGainesville

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BEIJING — For Jordan Romero, 
the 13-year-old American who be-
came the youngest climber to sum-mit Mount Everest, it all began with the desire to dream big.
The eighth grader from Califor-
nia said that he first came up with the idea to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents four years ago. On Saturday, he reached the top of the world’s highest mountain — and nearly completed his quest.
“The record is one thing, but 
standing on top of the world is 
just the best feeling you could ever 
imagine,” he said in an interview Monday by satellite phone from the 21,320-foot Advanced Base Camp.
Two days earlier, Jordan had 
succeeded in scaling the 29,035-foot peak, accompanied by a team that included his father, his father’s girlfriend and three Sherpa guides. 
Before him, the youngest climber 
to scale Everest had been Temba Tsheri of Nepal, who reached the peak at age 16.Jordan said he hoped his achieve-
ment would encourage young peo-
ple worldwide to set their own big 
dreams and pursue them.
“I’m doing this to inspire other 
kids, hopefully across the world, to get outdoors and to set goals in life. I’m doing this to set an example for them,” he said.
His success means he remains 
just a climb away from his overall 
goal of reaching the highest peaks 
on all seven continents. The final peak is the 16,076-foot Vinson Mas-sif in Antarctica, which he hopes to tackle at the end of the year.
The group, dubbed “Team Jor-
dan,” had chosen to climb the tech-nically more difficult northern side of Everest because the Chinese side 
has no age limits for climbers. The 
southern approach from Nepal re-quires climbers to be at least 16. 
The climb had many tough mo-
ments, the teen said. At one point, the water bottles froze, and the team went without liquids for 10 hours. The most difficult point came when he developed stomach cramps on the final ascent.
“It was the toughest part of the 
climb because I was thinking, ‘Man, I don’t know if I’ll make it ‘cause this is the worst pain I had ever felt in my stomach.’ But when we approached the summit, it all just faded away. I just felt happiness,” he said.
When the group finally reached 
the top, Jordan recalled touching the colorful prayer flags draped at the peak before standing with his arms 
outstretched, yelling in exultation.
“I was so happy that all of us as 
a team, both my parents and all our Sherpas, had made it to the summit,” 
he said. “I was happy about that ... 
that I had accomplished something 
so unbelievable. It was a feeling that will definitely be with me for the rest of my life.”
His next step was to call his 
mother, Leigh Anne Drake, who lives in California, with the news.
“The first thing I said was, ‘Mom, 
it’s your son calling from the top of 
the world.’ Right away, I heard on 
the other line just craziness going on,” he said.
Jordan credits a few good luck 
charms that he carried with him, including a rabbit’s foot, a Tibetan prayer necklace, a cross from his grandfather, and a pair of kangaroo testicles given by a good friend.
The curly-haired teenager, from 
Big Bear in California’s San Bernar-dino Mountains, said his parents have been supportive of his dream ever since he was inspired at age 9 by a mural at school that showed the highest mountains on the seven continents.
His father, Paul Romero, a heli-copter paramedic who is trained in high-altitude rescue, and his father’s 
girlfriend, Karen Lundgren, have 
trained him for top-level mountain-eering. They reached the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa, the first of the seven peaks, when Jordan was 10 years old.
Romero and Lundgren are both 
adventure racers who compete in week-long endurance races that 
combine biking, climbing, moun-
taineering and paddling through wilderness areas.
“They are the most supportive 
parents ever. I do feel lucky for that. I don’t know if other parents would encourage their kids to go big. But that’s what I’m doing this for — to encourage kids who don’t have that, 
to go big and set goals in life,” Jor-
dan said.
Jordan said he hopes to tackle the 
final peak in Antarctica by Decem-ber or January. 
With this quest nearly finished, 
the teen already has his eyes on the next goal: He plans to climb the highest peaks in all 50 U.S. states.
INTERNATIONALYoungest Everest climber wants others to ‘go big’ 
“I was happy about that ... 
that I had accomplished 
something so unbeliev -
able. It was a feeling that 
will definitely be with me 
for the rest of my life.”

SEC BASEBALL STANDINGS POLL QUESTION TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANGHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF pitcher Stephanie Brombacher picked up three wins while allowing three runs in 
19 innings during the Gators’ Regional performance.
� UF BEAT FIU 13-3 TO CLINCH A 
SUPER REGIONAL BERTH. 
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
 
Although it was coming off its worst 
loss of the season, the Florida softball 
team proved last weekend it can play its 
best when it matters most. 
The No. 4 Gators (47-8) successfully 
rebounded from last week’s 9-1 South-eastern Conference Tournament semi-
final loss to then-No. 17 LSU by rolling 
through Gainesville’s NCAA Tournament Regional, which ended with UF’s five-in-ning 13-3 run-rule beatdown of FIU (38-
21) on Sunday. 
All weekend, Florida’s brightest star 
was junior ace Stephanie Brombacher, 
who gave up only three runs and 11 base runners while pitching every one of the 
team’s 19 innings. 
“The way she’s been pitching the last 
two games, I gotta give her the ball,” 
coach Tim Walton said of his decision to start Brombacher in her third game in as many days. “She had to have the ball to-
day and she really pitched well.”
Brombacher was aided by Florida’s po-
tent offense, which averaged more than 
eight runs per game on the weekend and 
twice gave Brombacher a lead before she 
ever took the field. 
The Gators’ quick-strike ability was 
never more apparent than on Sunday, when the team scored five runs on one hit in the top of the first thanks to a grand slam by freshman Brittany Schutte. 
“(The run support) just lets me go out 
there and make my pitches and lets my Gators sweep Regional
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Josh Adams began the regular 
season with a bang and ended it with 
one, too.
But he has not enjoyed that same 
success in between.
The junior second baseman hit 
two home runs in the season opener, and tallied four RBIs in the last two 
games of the Gators’ schedule Friday and Saturday. Adams hit 9 for 12 in 
those three contests.
However, he still came into 
last weekend’s monumental series 
against South Carolina hitting just 
.221.
“(Slumps are) not easy. You just 
go out there and keep playing be-cause you know everybody goes through it,” Adams said.
But by the time that series came to 
an end, his average had shot up 16 points as Adams helped the Gators 
take two of three from the Gamecocks to clinch the No. 1 seed in the South-
eastern Conference Tournament. No.

round of the tourney Wednesday at 
5:30 p.m. in Hoover, Ala.
His numbers from the weekend 
could have been even better if South Carolina right fielder Whit Merrifield 
hadn’t stuck his 
glove over the fence and stolen an op-posite-field homer 
away from Adams Sunday.
But the fact he 
has been staying 
back and taking the 
ball the other way is 
a good sign for the Gators.
“(Hitting the ball to opposite field 
has) been my approach ever since I got here. I kind of strayed away from 
that in the beginning of the season,” 
he said. “It has just taken me a while Adams ends long slumpUF BASEBALL
Kevin O’Sullivan is the R. Kelly of 
college baseball coaches.
Like the freakin’-weekend-lov-
ing R&B sensation, Florida’s coach does not worry about age when choosing among his stable of talent. 
Look at UF’s catcher, shortstop and third 
baseman. Look at two-thirds of the starting rotation. Look at the DH. 
All freshmen. Playing for a top-5 program, these first-
year players have faced essentially the same 
questions over and over. 
Is it possible to have an immediate im-
pact in the Southeastern Conference? What 
do you think it will be like to play in your 
first SEC series? How big of a help has (in-
sert upperclassman’s name here) been?
The answers, like the questions, are con-
sistent. “I’m just here to work hard.” “Play-ing in the SEC is going to be tough.” “The 
older guys have been incredibly helpful.”
Bull.
Freshmen don’t need that much help. 
The No. 4 Gators did not have to overcome 
their youth to win the conference champi-
onship this season; they had to embrace it. 
Nolan Fontana anchored the team’s de-fense at shortstop, committing just two errors in 200-plus 
chances. Hudson 
Randall led the start-ers with a 2.99 ERA. And pitcher/des-
ignated hitter Brian 
Johnson did it all, throwing in 13 games 
and slugging .571.
The concept of a small-town legend ad-
justing to the big time is dead. Players who come to Florida, a haven for top-10 recruit-ing classes in every sport, have already competed at the highest levels for their age 
groups.
Gators home-run leader Austin Maddox 
played on the USA National Team in high 
school, traveling to Alberta and Venezuela. Do you think he was intimidated by that 
trip to Lexington, Ky., in April?

MIAMI — In his NBA job, Miami Heat 
star Dwyane Wade follows a rulebook. The 
people suing him for $25 million want the same concept applied to his business deal-ings.
With opposing attorney Richard Bales 
often referring to the contract related to a failed restaurant venture as “the rulebook” and grilling Wade for hours, the Miami Heat star spent a full day on the witness stand Monday in a breach-of-contract suit brought against him by two scorned ex-business partners who say he walked away from the 
deal and cost them millions.
In short, plaintiffs Lauren Hollander and 
Mark Rodberg say Wade didn’t follow the 
rulebook — the contract — and, because of his estimated $30 million salary through 
basketball and endorsements, could simply 
walk away from the deal. Wade says Hol-
lander and Rodberg side is guilty of the foul, and he was committed to having the restau-rant plans work.
“I didn’t want to end it,” Wade said Mon-
day on the witness stand. “This is something I was excited about, outside of basketball, something that thrilled me to think about the possibility.”
Wade also testified for about an hour on 
Friday. He will be back on the stand again today.
One of the central issues in the case deals 
with why Wade and longtime associate Marcus Andrews originally accepted a deal for a 12 percent stake in the planned chain of D. Wade’s Place sports-themed restaurants, then increased their request to 30 percent shortly after the paperwork was signed.
Only two of the restaurants opened, both 
closing relatively quickly. Rodberg and Hol-lander filed suit in December 2008. Wade is also seeking damages, contending that his likeness and name were used in ways he did not approve.
Wade seemed relaxed much of the day, 
smiling often and chatting with court per-sonnel during breaks while sipping water. He and Bales were even downright conver-sational at times, confiding in each other that neither views math as a personal strength.
When asked by Bales about certain per-
centage increases in the contract, Wade re-plied, “Mr. Bales, I left school early and this would be a reason why. I’m lost with the percentages. I don’t think I’ll get the per-centages analogy.”
Bales wanted to know why Wade and 
Andrews asked for a substantially higher in-terest in the venture, something Wade said happened only after Richard von Houtman, another former partner in the failed deal,  al-
legedly did not “do what he said he would do as a partner.”
Wade originally was 
to be paid $1 million as well as receive 10 percent 
ownership in the venture, with Andrews getting a 2 percent stake. The rest 
would go to von Houtman and Rodberg.
On the stand, Wade testified that he and 
Andrews eventually proposed that Rodberg receive a 70 percent interest, with them split-ting the remaining 30. The business relation-ship broke down quickly from there.
“The conversations with Mark, it was just 
mutually agreed upon that Richard wasn’t doing his job,” Wade said. “So we came back and asked for an increase in our percentag-es because as we knew and as Mark knew, we were doing our fair share — if not even more — to make sure of making sure that these restaurants were being successful and we had a partner that wasn’t.”
The original plan to market a line of T-
shirts, according to von Houtman and court documents, quickly turned to talk of upscale, sports-themed restaurants that would sell all sorts of Wade memorabilia. Von Houtman brought in Rodberg, who had experience in developing restaurants, and the two of them inked the D. Wade’s Place deal with Wade and Andrews on Aug. 6, 2007.
“I didn’t want to terminate the joint ven-
ture agreement,” Wade testified. “As I stat-ed, getting involved in these restaurants was something that I always wanted to do, so I just trying to find a way to make it work, Mr. Bales, not terminate it.”
The trial will continue Tuesday and 
Thursday this week, with Wednesday off for a juror to attend a family funeral and Friday off so Wade can appear at a hearing related to his ongoing divorce and custody fight in Chicago.

IRVING, Texas — Ready for an outdoor 
Super Bowl in cold, possibly snowy weather? 
Thinking that new overtime rule adopted for playoff games should be used in the regular 
season, too?
NFL owners will discuss those things and 
more Tuesday.
The 2014 Super Bowl site definitely will 
be picked. It’s widely expected to go to the new $1.6 billion Meadowlands stadium that 
will become home to the Jets and Giants this season, although Miami and Tampa also are 
bidding.
The new stadium for the New York City 
area would seem like a natural site for the 
NFL’s marquee event, especially with league 
headquarters in Manhattan. Plus, the league has a history of rewarding cities for building 
expensive new stadiums by giving them a Super Bowl.But there’s a fundamental problem: the 
Meadowlands doesn’t have a roof and tem-peratures are usually in the 20s during early February in East Rutherford, N.J. There’s 
even a league rule aimed at ensuring good weather, either by playing in a warm climate or by having a roof; the fact it was waived for 
this bid shows that this might be a shoo-in.
Yet there will still be a vote and teams in 
other cold-climate cities could support it in 
hopes of permanently scrapping the weath-
er rule so they, too, can host the lucrative event.
“I don’t see how it’s not played here,” Jets 
coach Rex Ryan said. “We’ve got the best 
city in the world. I think that’s indisputable. 
We’ve got arguably one of the top stadiums in the league, a brand-new stadium and it 
helps two teams.”
As for overtime, when owners last met, 
in March, they voted to change the sudden-
death rule so that if a team losing the coin toss immediately gives up a field goal, they 
still get a chance to score and either tie it or 
win — but only in the playoffs.
There’s a sentiment that if the rule is good 
enough for the postseason, it should be done 
in the regular season.
“It is on the agenda for a ‘possible vote’ 
after consultation with the 
clubs,” said Atlanta Falcons 
president Rich McKay, co-chairman of the competi-
tion committee. “In March, there were a number of clubs who wanted to dis-
cuss it at the May meeting, 
and we will see if this leads 
to a vote on the issue.”
Owners also will talk about the proposed 
sale of the St. Louis Rams.
Illinois businessman Shahid Khan reached 
agreement with owners Chip Rosenbloom and his sister, Lucia Rodriguez on Feb. 11 to buy the team for an estimated $750 million. 
Last month, Missouri billionaire Stan Kroen-
ke — who already owned 40 percent of the team — exercised his right to match the offer 
and purchase the remaining 60 percent of the club.
Beyond the financial issues, there’s also a 
problem because Kroenke owns the NBA’s 
Denver Nuggets and the NHL’s Colorado 
Avalanche, and NFL rules prohibit owners from also owning clubs in the NBA, NHL or 
Major League Baseball.
Commissioner Roger Goodell also is like-
ly to address a Supreme Court ruling against 
the league Monday in its quest for antitrust protection. Justices said the league must be 
considered 32 separate teams — not one big business — when selling branded items like 
jerseys and caps.
Smith and the NFLPA lauded the court 
for a move it says keeps the league from act-
ing like a monopoly.
the top-10 in singles competition.
Midfielder Erika Tymrak played in the 
U-17 Women’s World Cup in New Zealand. 
She adjusted to the SEC easily, finishing 
her freshman campaign third on the team in points scored while displaying the best touch.
And yet, people are still surprised each time this happens. How are you doing this? 
This is the SEC!
A paradox exists in college sports. We – 
fans, coaches, the media – anoint every blue-
chip prospect as the team’s savior, until he 
or she arrives on campus. 
Just ask Bob Knight, who compared ev-
ery newcomer to a young Isiah Thomas, 
then convinced himself those same recruits couldn’t even dribble a basketball once they became Hoosiers.
But if a player like Maddox is considered 
the gem of the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation, we should be ready for him to lead the team in slugging.
A freshman’s success can also be sur-
prising because the newcomer himself low-ers expectations. Players like Maddox are trained by the UF media relations team to feign open-eyed wonder, for good reason.The truth – that freshmen are recruited to 
put points on the board immediately – cur-rently comes across as brash.
But if people realized how experienced 
first-year players really are, the truth would not lead to unfairly negative comparisons to 
R. Kelly, who in 2007 said:
 “I’m the Ali of today. I’m the Marvin 
Gaye of today. I’m the Bob Marley of today. 
I’m the Martin Luther King.” NFL owners to discuss and vote on proposed changes   
defense work,” Brombacher said of her team jump-ing out to the early lead. “It kinda takes a little bit of weight off of my shoulders.” 
The Golden Panthers scored two in the bottom of 
the first to cut the Gators’ lead to three, but that was as close as they would get as senior Corrie Brooks pushed the lead back to five in the third with a two-
run home run to left. 
The round-tripper was Brooks’ ninth of the season 
and the team’s record-high 100th on the year. 
“It’s just about the way we practice and the way 
we mentally approach hitting one through nine,” 
Walton said. “When your eight-hole 
hitter hits a 270-foot home run and does it regularly, it’s like Brittany Schutte said, you just feed off of each other and 
keep on building momentum and that’s 
how we’re able to hit so many.”
Two of the weekend’s long balls came from junior 
Kelsey Bruder, who was without question Florida’s top offensive performer. 
The right fielder, who moved up three spots to 
third in the lineup due to some favorable pitching matchups, went 6 for 10 with two home runs and 4 RBIs in the Regional. 
“I don’t feel any different I’m just going out there 
with the same approach of just get on base,” Bruder said after Saturday’s 6-0 victory over UCF. “Every time you try to hit a home run it doesn’t work out so I’m just thinking single up the middle.” 
Following Sunday’s win, Florida will host No. 14 
Arizona State for a three-game series in the NCAA Super Regional round of 16, which begins Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and concludes on Sunday. Gators hit record

other way.”
Hitting two home runs in the season opener turned 
out to be a negative. Adams said the early power surge made him go away from his original approach at the 
plate. 
However, he is starting to show flashes from his 
days as a two-time member of the All-SEC team.
The right-handed batter sprayed four of his six hits 
to right field against South Carolina.His recent success has not come without a price, 
though.
“He’s been working awfully hard. He came down 
for early batting practice (Friday) and (Saturday),” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He left the hotel at 
lunch time with a couple other guys and he’s been putting in the work.”
But with the postseason looming, he is reaping the 
benefits at the right time.
“It feels good,” Adams said. “Confidence comes in 
many ways and I definitely needed it .It’s definitely a 
good time for me to start swinging.”BASEBALL , from page 17

UF freshman Lauren Embree clinched the semifinal victory over North Carolina to 
send the Gators to the NCAA Championship against Stanford.
� THE GATORS WILL PLAY FOR THE 
NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY AT 2 P.M.
STAFF REPORT
 
When the season began, UF women’s ten-
nis coach Roland Thornqvist said he felt like 
it had been a long time since 2003, the year Florida won its last national title.
He might not be referencing 2003 much 
longer.  The No. 3 Gators (29-2) have the op-portunity to bring a fifth NCAA Team Cham-pionship back to Gainesville when they face No. 8 Stanford (25-1) today at 2 p.m. on ES-PNU.
The 2003 championship was won in a 4-3 
upset against the Cardinal in Gainesville, where the home crowd was a factor.  This 
time, the Gators will not be on their home 
court when they face Stanford, but the Dan Magill Tennis Complex is hardly foreign to this team.
Monday’s 4-0 win against No. 2 North 
Carolina marked UF’s seventh win this sea-son in Athens, Ga.
Florida’s top three singles players all en-
ter the match on a high note.
Southeastern Conference Tournament 
Most Valuable Player Marrit Boonstra con-tinued her strong showing in Athens with a 6-2, 6-2 win over North Carolina’s Sophie Grabinski that extended her singles win streak to 17 matches.
Her doubles partner, No. 8 Allie Will, put 
UF in position to clinch with a 6-3, 6-3 win over No. 54 Katrina Tsang at the No. 2 spot.
Will enters today’s match undefeated in 
dual-match singles this season with 26 wins.
Fellow freshman sensation No. 9 Lauren Embree sent the Gators to the championship match with a 6-2, 1-6, 7-5 defeat of Sanaz Ma-rand.
Since a tough three-match losing stretch at 
the ITA Team Indoor Tournament in Febru-ary, Embree has strung together a 16-match winning streak heading into the champion-ship match. Embree’s strong showing at the No. 1 position this year for Florida helped make her the first freshman to be named the SEC Player of the Year.  She was also named the ITA Southeast Region Rookie of the Year.
Saturday against Miami, Embree achieved 
her most impressive win of the season when she upset No. 7 Laura Vallverdu.
However, she may face her toughest chal-
lenge today when she takes on No. 4 Hillary Barte.
In Stanford, the Gators face a traditional 
power (15 national titles), but a relative un-known in regards to this year.
Many fans and experts consider this to be 
a down year for the Pacific-10 Conference in women’s tennis and Stanford did not take part in the ITA Team Indoor Tournament in Madison, Wis.
UF faced one Pac-10 opponent at the in-
door tournament in February, UCLA, and lost 4-1.  More recently, the Gators defeated Washington 4-0 on May 14 in the second 
round of the NCAA Tournament.
The No. 6 Gators men’s tennis team (21-5) 
will not be taking part in the men’s portion of 
today’s championships. No. 12 Georgia,  the tournament host, upset UF 4-2 in the round of 16 Friday.  Senior Antoine Benneteau and junior Alexandre Lacroix will take part in the NCAA Individual Championships beginning Wednesday in Athens.

The Gators enjoyed the luck of 
the Irish in South Bend, Ind., at the Central Regional this past weekend, and finished high enough to earn a bid for the NCAA Championships.
Florida joins first-place Stanford, 
runner-up FSU, and Duke and LSU who finished in the fourth and fifth spots.“To finish in third wasn’t exactly 
what we wanted, but we live to see another day,” UF coach Buddy Al-exander said. “It was an interesting 
week of ebbs and flows, but I think 
we played solid for the most part. We are happy to be advancing to the next round.”
This is Alexander’s 22nd appear-
ance in the NCAA Championships in his 23 years as UF’s coach.
Florida finished the first day of 
the Central Regional in second place at 279, -1. Freshman Phillip Choi 
(69,-1) and junior Bank Vongvanij 
(68, -2) were the 
standouts for 
UF on day one. Vongvanij hit 16 straight pars be-fore sinking back to back birdies to finish the round.
“Bank was terrific, and it was a 
great round for him,” Alexander said. “We played solid in spite of a shaky start; the team really turned things around on four and five.”
The second day of the tourna-
ment was suspended due to inclem-ent weather with all five UF golfers scattered between holes 13 to 16. UF finished the day in fourth place with a score of 506, +5.
The Gators were a couple shots 
off the bubble, and were encouraged by Alexander to ‘step up and get a good round in’. After strong finishes earlier that 
day including the holes from the suspended second day, the Gators played well as they posted a one-
under, 279 in the final round and 
carded a final tournament score of 838, -2. 
“By far the biggest and best thing 
was that we were able to finish off the second round as we did. It gave us cushion going into the final round that we didn’t have,” Alexan-der said. UF vies for national title
