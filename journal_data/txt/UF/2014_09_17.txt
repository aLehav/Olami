Accent Speaker’s Bureau brought former Israeli 
Ambassador Michael Oren and Italian-Palestinian 
journalist Rula Jebreal together for a discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂ  ict Tuesday, where they agreed to disagree on the roots of the issue. 
Students felt the heat of the topic. Before the 
event began, Students for Justice in Palestine 
stood in the rain outside the University Auditori-
um, holding signs that read “Oren’s speech is hate speech,” “No war crimes on our campus,” and “Gainesville stands with Gaza.”  
“It is appalling to have a war criminal on cam-
pus,” Tesneem Shraiteh, a 20-year-old UF linguis-tics junior said about Oren. “We want to voice our opinions that this is not okay with us.” 
Moderator Matthew Jacobs, UF associate pro-
fessor of U.S. foreign relations, sat in between the two guests on the University Auditorium stage. He said the discussion was valuable and invited Jebreal to start off the conversation on the conﬂ  ict.
“I felt the urgency to come here to talk to you,” 
Jebreal said to the audience. “I want you to look at the other side. Not of Hamas, but of the Palestin-ians.” 
She said the Palestinians should be treated as 
equal citizens of Israel, entitled to have their voices heard and a sense of belonging to a homeland.  
Oren agreed the narrative is important and said 
we must recognize each other’s. He then switched gears, identifying how the media is biased to high-light the best news. 
Jebreal rolled her eyes, and their own conﬂ  ict 
began. Accent hosts discussion on Israel-Palestine conﬂ  ict
� ROUTE 126 GETS 3 BUSES.

Three UF East/West campus circula-
tor buses will now run from 5:40 p.m. un-
til 12:05 a.m. starting tonight, in an effort to increase campus safety precautions and minimize bus wait times, according 
to UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
The 126 route originally ran two bus-
es throughout the day and one after 5:40 
p.m., but Sikes said UF Business Affairs and Regional Transit System worked to-gether to extend the routes’ original bus-es and add another bus in the afternoon.
Keeping three 126 buses in service af-
ter 5:40 p.m. will cost UF Business Affairs about $25,000, Sikes said. The investment follows a string of three separate assaults 
plaguing campus since Aug. 30.
“We hope these new hours will help 
our students, faculty, staff and our UF 
Health employee partners with getting to and from their classes and jobs safely at night,” she said.
The 126 wait time will now be about 
12 minutes, Sikes said. The wait time with one bus was about 45 minutes.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner said 
federal regulations require RTS to keep an extra 10 percent of buses on its ﬂ  eet as backup, which is where the new 126 bus will come from.
“It’s a great partnership between the 
two of us to improve transportation ser-vices to students, faculty, staff and retir-ees,” Skinner said.Buses added to night route � IT WON’T LAST MORE THAN A 
WEEK.

Ultimate Towing of Gainesville Inc. vol-
untarily suspended all roam trespass towing 
operations Monday as the company conducts an internal review and reorganization. 
Ultimate is one of the city’s biggest towing 
companies and is currently inspecting each of its more than 2,000 tow-away signs citywide. 
The company’s owner, Stephen O’Grady, 
said in a press release that the internal review was more of an inventory than anything. The suspension will not last more than a week, and the company will review each of its con-tracts before resuming operations.
O’Grady was unavailable for comment 
Tuesday. Ultimate Towing is working closely with 
Gainesville Police as they internally review and evaluate state statutes and city ordinance 
compliances, according to the press release. 
The company’s trespass-towing permit was previously revoked in 2011 because they il-
legally removed vehicles from the Canopy 
Apartments complex. 
The company’s previous owner, Stan For-
ron, was arrested in April when he and Bon-Ultimate suspends roam towingSEE ACCENT, PAGE 4

� CHAMP WILL HAND 
OUT FOOD TODAY.
TAYLOR RUSSELL
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Students no longer have to 
choose between paying for tu-
ition or food with the help of the Christian Home Area Min-
istry Partners’ food giveaway 
today. 
The need for food among 
universities has escalated with the 27 percent increase in 
tuition, Betty Jones, director of 
Christian Home Area Ministry 
Partners (CHAMP), said. 
CHAMP will pass out free 
food at the Baptist Student 
Union at 1604 W. University 
Ave. at 4 p.m. This is the first 
time the mobile food pantry organization will hand out food in close proximity to 
campus. 
CHAMP will provide about 
2,000 pounds of food to stu-
dents, including breads, pas-tries, fresh fruits, vegetables, 
cereal, rice and frozen meats.
“We think there are stu-
dents on campus who defi-
nitely need some help,” Jones said. 
Jones said they are hoping 
to host the mobile pantries at least once a month. If sorori-ties, fraternities or other stu-dent organizations help spon-sor CHAMP, then even more mobile pantries will become available.
The charity, which has 
been operating for a year, partners with local food pan-try Bread of the Mighty Food Bank to provide food for its giveaways.  
“Over the summer, we got 
many calls from college stu-dents just looking for food,” Jones said.
Jones said when students’ 
financial aid runs out, they often don’t have the money to pay for food. 
Students like Devon Lea-
sure, an 18-year-old UF politi-cal science freshman, believe that the food pantry will help out a lot of students. 
“Students need to spend 
their money on education and tuition, and many might not have the luxury to buy things as necessary as food,” Devon said.
Although Kaley Pinner, a 
19-year-old UF applied physi-ology and kinesiology sopho-more, supports CHAMP and the assistance it brings to stu-dents, she said students could abuse the pantries by taking food when they are not truly in need.
“There is definitely a need 
out there,” Pinner said. “I just hope the organization is used in the right way.”
Organizations looking to 
help out with the mobile food bank can donate $200 to put on their own food drive.  
Jones said the mobile pan-
try is first come, first served, but if the pantry has food left over, students may walk through the line again for a second time.
“The goal is to leave with 
nothing but the shirts on our backs and empty boxes,” Jones said. Food giveaway for 
low-income students

UF’s Sid Martin Biotechnology 
Incubator was recognized as a na-
tional leader in technology-based economic development in the eyes of the State Science and Technology 
Institute.
The incubator accepted the 2014 
Excellence in Technology-Based 
Economic Development award Monday at the SSTI’s Annual Con-ference in Chicago 
SSTI is an organization that had 
policy makers and people from 42 states placing its five awards.
The incubator program won the 
award for its ability to commercial-ize technologies, said Patti Breed-love, UF Sid Martin Biotechnology director.
“That means that we are one of the players here locally that helps research, from the university and other places, turn into relevant prod-ucts and services to make the world a better place,” she said. 
The incubator is a 40,000-square-
foot bioscience complex located in Alachua, which houses scientific equipment and greenhouses. 
Mentors, investors and other 
experienced professionals come together at the facility to grow and shape their ideas into game-chang-ing products, from gene therapy to green energy to safer agricultural products. It has already created 2,000 local jobs.
“We’re able to help these re-
searchers go from two, three guys in a lab to a company that eventually goes on and grows on its own into a huge company,” said Nathalie Mc-Crate, marketing coordinator for the incubator. 
Breedlove said the program has 
blossomed recently, with its compa-nies attracting more than $1.2 billion in funding. This is the incubator’s fourth notable award in two years. 
“The wonderful thing about it is 
that every time this happens to one of our organizations in the county, it 
just helps put the whole Gainesville 
area on the map,” Breedlove said. “For people to know that this is a great town to do bio-tech and tech. That’s one of the benefits of an award like this.”
Breedlove said the award reflects 
well on the university. 
“It draws attention to the enor-
mous amount of high-quality re-search going on at UF,” she said, “and UF’s sophistication and being able to create start-up companies based on that technology.”
UF Sid Martin incubator gets awardnalyn Beth Lachut, a previous Canopy Apartments 
property manager, allegedly stole two scooters, staged them as if they were parked illegally and towed them, calling them in as abandoned. 
Ultimate will still provide call-in towing ser-
vices and respond to both roadside assistance cus-tomers and accident emergencies. Roam towing is expected to resume again sometime next week.
Wade Swikle, who graduated from UF in 2012 
with a telecommunication degree, said he could see this roam towing suspension becoming a problem for businesses. 
“If students are parking in Midtown to go to 
class, that’s obviously going to cause problems for businesses that are there,” Swikle said. 
Swikle, 24, had his car towed by Ultimate Tow-
ing in July 2013 while at a friend’s house. 
Swikle said he asked the tow-truck driver to un-
hook his car but was told he’d have to pay $76 to retrieve it from the company’s impound lot. Swikle said he’s been towed five or six times in his life. 
“They kind of go a little bit overboard, and 
sometimes, it doesn’t always make sense,” Swikle said. 
Alyssa Magill, a 19-year-old UF animal sciences 
sophomore, said her friend received a $150 ticket last week and now worries about getting towed and ticketed. She lives in Broward Hall and said she parks across from Hume Hall before walking home.
Still, Magill said the suspension might cause 
problems.
“I think it’ll be a bigger inconvenience for some 
students,” she said, “because if a lot of students just parked wherever, then people who actually need the spots or are registered for the spots can’t park there.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2014

MICHAEL RANKIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The City of Gainesville is de-
veloping new bright green bike 
boulevards this semester, aiming 
to reroute bicyclists to lower traffic areas, enhance their mobility and 
ensure their safety. 
The city’s sole bike boulevard 
currently runs down West 12th Street, stretching from the inter-
section of Northwest 13th Street 
and Northwest 19th Lane near Gainesville High School, down to the intersection of Southwest 11th 
Street and Depot Avenue.
The new boulevards will in-
clude a connection between the 
Waldo Road trail and routes along Northwest Third Avenue, from 
Northwest 21st Street to Northeast Seventh Street.
Regional Transit System spokes-
man Chip Skinner said the initiative 
advances the goals and objectives outlined in the City of Gainesville’s comprehensive plan by adding infrastructure that supports a bal-
anced transportation system for 
both bicyclists and motorists.
“The system adds alternative 
routes to busy corridors around the 
city, such as University Avenue, 
where it is not feasible to add bike lanes,” he said.
The City Commission allocated 
$200,000 to the bike boulevard sys-
tem, which covers the cost of install-
ing bike boxes and a bike-detection mechanism, which will notify traf-fic lights when a bicyclist is present 
and allow them to pass through an 
intersection more quickly.“The bike detection works the 
same way as a vehicle detection,” 
Skinner said.
John Clifford, a 21-year-old UF 
wildlife ecology and conservation 
junior and Jimmy John’s bike deliv-erer, said the bike boxes are a good 
idea because they give cyclists the 
right of way when approaching an intersection.
“When I use the 12th Street cor-
ridor, I usually will show other cy-clists how to use the bike box,” Clif-ford said. “Definitely not enough people know how to use them.”
Clifford said he was hit by a car 
in July, landing him in the hospital.
“Drivers don’t pay the best at-
tention,” he said.
Cycling advocate Joseph Floyd 
founded the group Get Active GNV to raise awareness about local bike safety.
“Gainesville is far more biker-
friendly than many other cities in 
Florida, mostly due to there being 
a high volume of cyclists,” said Floyd, who also serves as the zero waste coordinator for UF’s Office of Sustainability.
He said the usefulness of the 
boulevard system is best deter-mined by measuring how well the bike boulevards work together rather than as different individual routes.
“It’s not about one lane here or 
one lane there; it’s about how the system works as a grid,” Floyd said. “If the initiative decreases ac-cidents and increases convenience 
for cyclists using the system, it’s a 
good use of money.”

Guests took questions from students after
While she said Hamas was a bi-
product of occupation and the worst 
thing to happen, the Palestinians have been detained since before Hamas came into power. 
“There’s not an occupation,” Oren 
said. “Hamas chose not to be peace-ful.” 
Jebreal interrupted Oren, explaining 
her views on Palestinians’ lack of hu-man rights in the so-called democratic Jewish state. Speaking passionately with anecdotes and historical facts, she said they should have full rights.
“They’re blocked in because other-
wise, they’ll kill us,” Oren said. “I dis-agree with everything you said.” 
Oren, a self-proclaimed Zionist, list-
ed the issues on the Israeli side, and he also gave facts proving Israel is demo-cratic and has been coexisting with Pal-estinians. 
After an hour and a half, Jacobs 
asked two of his questions and two out of the 16 submitted by students. 
Naor Amir, a  UF mechanical engi-
neering senior, said he thought Jebreal had emotional appeal, and Oren had good counter arguments. “I think the moderator could have 
done a better job of dividing the time between them,” Amir, 21, said. 
Students left the auditorium to find 
the Students for Justice in Palestine still holding up their posters. 
“This topic is dubbed controver-
sial and not talked about on campus,” Shraiteh said. “There is a skewed ver-sion of this so-called conflict. Palestin-ian voices are not really heard.” 
Other students walked away from 
the event with more positive feelings. 
“I thought it was a good event,” 
Amir said. “I would love to see similar events in the future.”
Accent , from page 1Bike boxes:
• Cars should not enter the 
green bike box while waiting for a 
traffic signal to turn green, whether a bicyclist is present or not.
• Bicyclists should move from 
the bike lane and into the bike box in front of cars, so the bike-detec-tion mechanism can activate the intersection’s green light.

After the new Activity and Ser-
vice Fee budget received its final 
nod of approval Tuesday night, 
UF’s Student Senate opened up the 
floor to a few guest speakers.
Hiram Martinez-Cabrera, a 
UF public relations junior and the 
executive director of UF’s Pride 
Awareness Month, criticized Stu-dent Government’s handling of the recent assaults on campus during public debate. 
He said the hashtags #NoGator-
WalksAlone and #BeAwareBeA-Gator blame the victims instead of preventing rape.
“Sexual assault is not only a 
women’s issue,” Martinez-Cabrera said. “The community of sexual as-sault survivors is as diverse as our students.”
After, Dean of University Li-
braries Judy Russell presented the redesign of Library West’s Colon-nade to get ideas from senators.
The colonnade will be renovated 
into an outside study area for stu-dents, adding 290 seats. The area will use solar panels to power fans, 
lighting and charging stations.
The $1.4 million project will be 
funded by private donors, Russell 
said. Depending on if they get the 
money, it would take only 77 days 
to finish the outdoor study area.  
“Access to the library will not 
be affected during construction,” Russell said.  
Her presentation was followed 
by a homemade SG video to edu-cate students about how to avoid towing after the City Commission 
raised towing fines from $75 to 
$100.

but did not give his consent to being searched when asked, ac-cording to a report. 
White said McKnight then 
appeared nervous as backup arrived and started to fight.
While resisting officers, 
McKnight pulled a vial with 
pieces of crack cocaine from his 
pocket and threw it. Officers said he also tried swallowing a bag of Xanax but was unsuc-cessful. 
According to the report, 
McKnight purposely elbowed Officer Daniel Abbott in the head during the fight as well 
as tossed White’s police radio 
from his belt, temporarily pre-venting him from calling in ad-ditional backup.
Even when White used a 
Taser on him, McKnight con-tinued to fight, grabbing at the officers’ gun belts. 
He was arrested on charges 
of the possession of crack co-caine with intent to sell, pos-session of Xanax, tampering with evidence, battery on a law 
enforcement officer, depriving 
a law enforcement officer of communication and resisting arrest.

re-evaluate testing
standardization
The state of Florida has an addiction to testing.
An August report by The Washington Post took an in-
depth look at the system of standardized testing in Flor-
ida’s public schools. The ﬁ  ndings were astounding. According 
to a schedule released by Miami-Dade County Public Schools, 
the district will be conducting more than three dozen separate 
standardized tests for students in third through 12th grade dur-ing the 2014-2015 school year. 
That number doesn’t even include the Advanced Placement 
and International Baccalaureate exams taken by thousands of Florida high school students every year. 
The abundance of standardized tests in Florida schools is 
largely due to the efforts of former Gov. Jeb Bush. Bush was a proponent of comprehensive testing, and his “A+ Plan” helped 
tie school funding to student performance on a variety of tests. 
Since leaving the governor’s mansion, Bush has continued 
his advocacy for standardized testing. His foundation has found 
itself in ethical and legal trouble for using money donated by private education companies, such as Pearson and Amplify, to fund expensive conference trips for state education ofﬁ  cials.
Although former Gov. Charlie Crist and Gov. Rick Scott 
have not been as forceful in promoting standardized testing, the tests continue to play a central role in how Florida’s children are 
taught and schools are funded.
In theory, such tests can be a good measure of whether stu-
dents are learning and applying the material they are taught. 
Unfortunately, placing these tests at the center of Florida’s 
education system has had a negative effect on the state’s schools. 
Rather than learning the basic knowledge and skills needed to excel later in life, Florida students are being taught that test-tak-ing skills are the primary determinant of educational success. 
Anti-testing advocates scored a major win this week when 
state education ofﬁ  cials announced the cancellation of the Flori-da Assessments for Instruction in Reading (FAIR), administered to students in kindergarten through second grade.
The crusade against FAIR was led by Susan Bowles, an Ala-
chua County kindergarten teacher. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Bowles’ refusal to administer the test helped put pressure on the state to end it entirely. 
Although FAIR did not have implications for school funding, 
the fact that a standardized test for elementary school children 
ever existed to begin with is proof of how out of control Florida’s 
testing regime has become. 
Scott has ordered a full review of testing practices in Florida 
schools. Ultimately, such a review will be meaningful only if it leads to moving away from standardized testing and toward a focus on actual, substantive education.
The education with which we provide Florida’s elementary, 
middle and high school students will be a major factor in shap-ing the future of our state. To give these students the best educa-tion possible, the standardized testing craze must be brought to a swift and permanent end.
‘For the Gator Good’ lives up to its name
“Hey, Gators. Seven billion people call this planet 
home.”
Recently, an advertisement beginning with these 
thought-provoking words jumped out at me. After listing some of the major health, social and environmental issues of 
our day, it ended with, “Together we could make an impact, 
a very big impact. You in?”
The advertisement featured UF’s new campaign, “For the 
Gator Good,” which launched the ﬁ  rst Fall weekend. 
The campaign is well-crafted, if a bit lofty and idealistic, 
and may very will achieve its purpose in inspiring people to support the innovations taking place on this campus and in helping launch UF into a top-10 public university ranking.
UF is rebranding itself for the ﬁ  rst time in about a decade, 
moving away from its former campaign “The Foundation for the Gator Nation.” The former campaign strived to foster UF’s global community by highlighting the prominence of Gators around the world. 
In contrast, the new campaign turns away from the singu-
lar focus on Gators. Its website, with softer tones of navy and faded orange instead of the usually ﬂ  ashy, bright orange and blue, imparts a serious and thoughtful tone.  
The site is reminiscent of the popular Facebook page, 
“Humans of New York,” which captures emotionally stimu-lating photographs and quotes from ordinary New Yorkers. The campaign’s website tells the stories of 12 individuals who have been impacted  by UF. In an unusual twist, none of these individuals are UF students. 
The campaign shines a spotlight on issues like childhood 
obesity, medical research and immigration, and it points out the impact that Gators — and research conducted at UF — have had in combating many of the serious issues challeng-
ing our world today. 
The story of Ed Bonﬁ  glio, a soldier who was able to avoid 
amputation and keep his leg due to a procedure developed 
at UF, exempliﬁ  es the stories this campaign is trying to tell. 
Although the campaign’s focus on research may seem ex-
clusionary toward many undergraduate students, the over-all campaign captures the culture of the entire university.
The campaign launched on television Aug. 30 with a 30-second commercial slot during the UF vs. Idaho game on ESPNU. Shots included agricultural work-ers, doctors and children. 
In the coming weeks, these 
commercials —  the next one to air is on Oct. 11 during the UF vs. Louisiana State University game — will show us what we can all do to improve our world. 
Due to its heavy focus on the al-
truism of UF students and alumni, 
and its ﬁ  nal battle cry of “You in?,” the campaign can appear a bit idealistic. However, its message is still strong.
Furthermore, any accusations stating the campaign is 
simply a big public relations stunt should be given no atten-tion. Yes, the campaign is designed to bring funds to UF. UF needs money to invest in hiring new professors, funding re-search initiatives and much more.
However, the campaign doesn’t request money out of 
greed; the campaign focuses on how UF betters society.
Finally, it’s no coincidence that UF is in the process of try-
ing to reach a top 10 slot for national public universities. UF 
currently stands as the 14th best public university in the na-
tion, according to the U.S. News and World Report.
“For the Gator Good” also focuses on funding research 
in multiple departments. This common ground between the campaigns will have a positive effect on UF’s future rankings. “For the Gator Good” and “UF Rising” will work together to improve the quality of education at UF and the university’s standing relative to other schools.
UF offers some of the ﬁ  nest educational and research op-
portunities in the country. A UF education creates a founda-tion for students to participate in life-changing actions like the ones chronicled in the “For the Gator Good” campaign.
“For the Gator Good” really is for the greater good of this 
university. Its effects are going to improve this campus and will ultimately help UF ascend to a top-10 ranking.

Urban Outﬁ  tters — an overpriced 
retailer that appeals only to the thickheaded hipsters of America — 
made an awful blunder earlier this week. The store advertised a Kent State Univer-
sity sweatshirt covered in what appeared 
to be bloodstains. The sweatshirt would be bizarre unto itself, if it didn’t recall the hor-riﬁ  c events that took place on Kent State’s campus in 1970.
For those unaware of this infamous moment in 20th 
century American history, the National Guard opened ﬁ  re on Kent State’s campus during a protest against the Vietnam War, killing four students. The tragedy sent 
shockwaves across the nation and even inspired the 
haunting song “Ohio” by the band Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
Urban Outﬁ  tters was either oblivious to the obvious 
reference or, in great hipster fashion, was trying to be ironic when it produced the heinous shirt. Realizing its mistake — or attempting to avoid an even larger public relations disaster — Urban Outﬁ  tters apologized for the sweatshirt, making a dubious claim about why the shirt 
was stained red.
The company might claim it was part of a collection 
of shirts that were intentionally stained and then sun-
faded, but if that’s the case, why choose red, and why — out of all the colleges and universities in the U.S. — did they choose a school that dealt with such a violent tragedy?
Frankly, Kent State, the victims’ families and Amer-
icans of all stripes deserve more than a short apology 
from Urban Outﬁ  tters. What we deserve is common de-
cency.
Unfortunately, the atmosphere of learning, culture 
and growth on college campuses is occasionally disrupt-ed by violence, death and destruction that devastate us all. From Kent State to Virginia Tech to the recent shoot-ings at University of California, Santa Barbara, to UF’s own bout of horror in 1990, we don’t need some despi-cable reminder of tragedy all in the name of a retailer’s thickheaded attempt at irony.
No apology or public relations spin can 
change the fact that someone at Urban Out-ﬁ  tters thought it was a good idea to stain a 
sweatshirt red and slap the logo of a uni-
versity touched by violence. In fact, even if Urban Outﬁ  tters put the name of a fake university on the front of the shirt, what were they trying to prove? Furthermore, 
who in their right mind would buy a shirt covered in what appears to be blood?
If you ﬁ  nd nothing wrong with Urban Outﬁ  tters’ ac-
tion — and there will be some of you who feel this is 
blown out of proportion — is this any different than pro-
ducing a Columbine High School sweatshirt stained red? Even though the Kent State shootings occurred nearly 45 years ago, the amount of time should not diminish the horror experienced on that campus and just how heated the debate was over the Vietnam War.
Trivializing the events of May 4, 1970, trivializes ev-
ery school shooting since that day and every tragedy that shook our great nation to the bone. Kent State invited the 
leaders of Urban Outﬁ  tters to visit the campus visitor 
center to learn more about the shootings, and hopefully, the company graciously accepts that invitation.
Rather than ignore or trivialize history, we need to 
learn, understand and respect the events that shaped our country — for good or bad. 
If Urban Outﬁ  tters cannot learn from their mistake, 
what’s stopping them — or another company — from producing equally crass merchandise about another 
school shooting — or even 9/11 — in the years to 
come?
Let’s stop pretending that the sweatshirt was a dis-
turbing coincidence, and instead, realize that this was a company with no scruples and little to no respect for the tragedy it so pathetically trivialized.

cal campaigning. His columns appear on Wednesdays.Urban Outﬁ  tters’ Kent State sweat-

I’m about to do something 
very vulnerable.  Between my research and reﬂ  ections, 
I’m sure there is something 
here someone will take offense 
to. But, before you read on, there are two things you should 
know about me that may shape 
the way you interpret this ar-
ticle: First, I’m 5 feet 4 inches 
tall and weigh approximately 115 pounds.
Second, I’d like to share that 
I love my body.
For years, I struggled to ap-
preciate what I saw in the mir-ror. I felt guilty that others were 
put off by my frame, as well as 
confused when people told me 
I didn’t need to watch what I 
ate — so long as I was eating.
But you know what? Skinny 
doesn’t equal healthy.
In our culture, it has be-
come commonplace to make judgmental comments about 
someone’s body in the guise of 
concern: 
“Do you even eat?” 
“You have no real reason to 
have body image issues,” and 
“Do you have an eating dis-
order?” are some statements I related to from Lara Parker 
and Javier Moreno’s BuzzFeed 
article, “19 Things Every Natu-
rally Skinny Person Is Tired Of 
Hearing.”
Over time, these comments 
— directed at anyone of any 
size — can cause a person to 
feel alienated and shameful 
about who they are. However, 
there was one phrase from the 
list that struck me harder than 
the others.
There, at No. 15, I read: “It’ll 
catch up with you one day.”
When I hear or see this, my 
response usually consists of a shrug and a conceding “prob-
ably.”
What will catch up with me 
won’t be my weight, though. 
No, it’ll probably be diabe-
tes, heart disease, or a slew of 
other health issues associated 
with being thin — several of 
which run parallel to the prob-
lems connected to being over-
weight.
Being thin, yet unhealthy, is 
not uncommon. Naturally thin people might indulge in fast 
food and skip the gym, think-
ing they can get away with it because they’ve been misin-
formed from a young age that 
they can.
But no matter the number 
on the scale, blood sugar lev-els and bad cholesterol counts 
could be rising.
Thinner people might also 
skip out on check-ups that could detect serious medical 
problems because they believe 
they’re in good shape.
There is a growingly popu-
lar term for the people one doc-tor has described as “skinny fat.” They are the individuals who never eat vegetables, love red meat and can’t remember the last time they exercised —  and yet, they’re still thin.
But don’t be envious of 
those who don’t count calories or think twice about having a doughnut for breakfast. Skinny fat is a real and remarkably common issue that can have life-changing consequences.
This laissez-faire mental-
ity naturally thinner people have is a fault of our weight-obsessed culture. It is also one I’ve shared. For a long time, I allowed myself to think that so long as what I ate didn’t show up on the scale, I could do and consume whatever I wanted.
Then I started to realize that, 
compared to my friends, I was incredibly unhealthy. When they wanted to run a mile, I begged for them to power walk so I could keep up and breathe. While they made themselves dinners that included every food group, I was eating Chipo-tle and drinking my fourth Diet Coke of the day.
It wasn’t until a friend 
pointed out how terribly I was treating myself that I realized I needed to make a change, and fast. 
Nowadays, I walk to school 
rather than drive ﬁ  ve blocks and ﬁ  t in a workout whenever I can. I eat meals that include protein and vitamins I would have normally taken supple-ments for. I drink a bottle of water in between each caffein-ated beverage and try to stick to just one Diet Coke a day.
Like I said before, I love my 
body. I love it, not for its size, but for the fact that it’s a work in progress toward a healthier me. 
With every workout and 
balanced meal, I see a stronger woman in the mirror instead of a feeble girl.
So whether you think you’re 
too heavy or too lean, focus on being healthy instead. Let your lifestyle choices, not the num-ber on the scale, deﬁ  ne you.

Ray Rice, former running back 
for the Baltimore Ravens, is not the only professional 
sportsman or NFL darling to be charged with domestic abuse. 
Infamously dropped from the 
Ravens on Sept. 8, along with an indeﬁ  nite suspension from the NFL for assaulting his then-ﬁ  ancee Janay Palmer in an elevator last February, Ray Rice is one among a long list of domestic violence offenders that in-cludes professional sportsmen from the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL. 
However, Rice’s recent punishment 
has set a precedent for the NFL that others will hopefully follow.
Severely criticized for his leni-
ency — the NFL has shown more inclination to punish marijuana violations in the past — NFL com-
missioner Roger Goodell “took 
responsibility” for his mistake in a letter to fans and sponsors for what was initially a two-game suspension for Rice. He announced a new NFL policy against domestic violence that includes a six-game suspension without pay for ﬁ  rst offenders and a lifetime ban for second offenses. 
NFL punishment became more 
severe for Rice when a second video 
— in addition to the one showing 
him dragging Palmer’s unconscious body from the elevator — surfaced, showing Rice striking Palmer inside the elevator.
This video, which was made 
public, was undoubtedly instru-mental in determining the NFL pun-ishment for Rice and for the new NFL policy, but many such cases of domestic abuse in other institutions have received little to no punish-ment at all. 
Take Brett Myers, previous pitch-
er for the Philadelphia Phillies, who was charged in 2006 for striking his wife in the face and pulling her by the hair in public;  Semyon Varla-mov, goalie for the NHL’s Colorado 
Avalanche, who was arrested for 
kicking his girlfriend to the ﬂ  oor and stomping on her chest; or Ray Mc-Donald of the San Francisco 49ers, who was arrested after police con-ﬁ  rmed visible injuries on his preg-nant wife. 
All of these athletes were back 
the next game. Brett Myers’ gen-eral manager speciﬁ  cally defended his choice by saying, “He’s our best pitcher.”
These players’ actions, as well as 
the non-action of their organizations, show a blatant disregard for human 
rights. While some may argue that 
these organizations do not have a re-sponsibility for the morality of their players outside of the game, most of these athletes sign contracts that state otherwise.
 It is stated in the NFL’s code of 
conduct, for example, that “it is not enough to simply avoid being found guilty of a crime. Instead, as an em-ployee of the NFL or a member club, you are held to a higher standard and expected to conduct yourself 
in a way that is responsible [and] 
promotes the values upon which the league is based.” 
These athletes are not only rep-
resentatives of their teams and pro-fessional sports organizations, they are public ﬁ  gures and role models whether they choose to act like it.
This means that while coaches, 
managers and commissioners hide behind due process and wait for the victim to drop charges — an extremely common phenomenon with domestic violence victims — insufﬁ  cient evidence or some other circumstance to fail the conviction, 
people across the country watch 
their inaction and interpret their si-lence for apathy, or worse, support.
Who knows if the NFL is actually 
going to walk its talk, but for institu-tions such as these that are so visible and inﬂ  uential in our society, writ-ing a mission statement or artfully crafted public relations tweet is not enough; it has to take a serious stand against issues like domestic violence, 
and show us that the abuse will not 
be tolerated, even if that means tak-ing a stand against its players.

The local National Veterans Af-
fairs Brain Rehabilitation Research 
Center of Excellence hosted an open house Tuesday in celebration of a $4.5 million award. 
The event featured research 
projects on brain rehabilitation by 28 VA-funded investigators and 16 affiliate investigators at the Com-munity Living Center building on the campus of the Veteran Affairs medical center. 
The award will be dispersed over 
five years among the brain rehabili-
tation research consortium, which 
includes the Malcom Randall Veter-ans Affairs Medical Center, UF, UF Health Shands, UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital and the Brooks Re-habilitation Hospital in Jacksonville.
Thomas Wisnieski, the director 
of the North Florida/South Georgia Veterans Health System, congratu-
lated researchers at the event for 
their dedication to enhancing the lives of veterans and all those affect-ed by traumatic brain injuries. 
More than 150 people attended 
the event, including health science specialist Susan Leon, said Janis 
Daly, director of the Brain Rehabili-
tation Center. Leon researches treat-ment options for patients who have lost the ability to express their emo-tions due to brain injury. 
“I wouldn’t be able to do what I 
do if I didn’t have the center,” Leon said.  
At the event, Daly explained how 
out of the 15 centers of excellence around the country, the Gainesville center is the only one focused on brain rehabilitation. 
Before research was completed 
on brain rehabilitation, Dr. Carolyn Hanson, the clinical research coor-dinator for the center, said many believed that when the brain was in a traumatizing event, it would never recover to its original capacity. 
“We’ve debunked that pretty 
thoroughly,” Hanson said.
These research findings could be 
crucial for such conditions as post-traumatic stress disorder and trau-matic brain injury that many veter-ans are experiencing. 
“It’s often your parents or your 
uncles or your aunts that are possi-bly receiving this treatment,” Leon said. 
UF students are also contributing 
to the brain rehabilitation center’s research. 
Five or six students from UF 
work with the brain rehabilitation center every year, Hanson said.Dulce Castro, a 27-year-old UF 
electrical and computer engineering graduate student will be working at 
the center this year. Castro said she hopes her work, like the work of the 
researchers at the event, will some-day make a difference in people’s 
lives.  “It’s nice to see all the research 
work come together and have re-
searchers collaborate,” Castro said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PITTSBURGH — The final report from a 
landmark federal study on hydraulic frac-
turing, or fracking, found no evidence that chemicals or brine water from the gas drill-ing process moved upward to contaminate 
drinking water at a site in western Pennsyl-
vania.
The Department of Energy report, re-
leased Monday, was the first time an energy company allowed independent monitoring of a drilling site during the fracking process and for 18 months afterward. After those months of monitoring, researchers found that the chemical-laced fluids used to free gas 
stayed about 5,000 feet below drinking water 
supplies.
Scientists used tracer fluids, seismic moni-
toring and other tests to look for problems, and they created the most detailed public re-port to date about how fracking affects adja-cent rock structures.
The fracking process uses millions of gal-lons of high-pressure water mixed with sand and chemicals to break apart rocks rich in oil and gas. That has led to a national boom in production, but also to concerns about pos-
sible groundwater contamination.
Maya K. van Rossum, of the Delaware 
Riverkeeper group, mentioned harms related 
to shale gas development, including methane gas leaks, wasteful use of fresh water and air pollution. She also said the Energy Depart-ment study confirms a point that the River-keeper has been making: Faulty well con-struction is the root cause of most problems, not chemicals migrating up to rocks.
But the Energy Department report is far 
from the last word on the subject. The depart-
ment monitored six wells at one site, but oil 
or gas drilling at other locations around the nation could show different results because of variations in geology or drilling practices. Environmentalists and regulators have also documented cases in which surface spills of chemicals or wastewater damaged drinking water supplies.

A 24-year-old UF student drowned at the 
Stoneridge Apartments complex pool early 
Saturday morning, according to Gainesville 
Police. 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando confirmed 
the student’s identity Tuesday, but officers 
are still trying to contact his family over-
seas in India. 
Krishnendu Saha was an electrical and 
computer engineering graduate student, 
Orlando said. Saha started at UF this se-mester, only a few weeks before drowning 
in the pool at about 5 a.m. Saturday.
At about 4:30 a.m., GPD officers re-
sponded to a noise complaint at the Ston-
eridge pool at 3800 SW 34th St., where a 
group of students were hosting a gathering 
and asked them to leave.
But half an hour later, two students re-
turned to the area to pick up items they forgot and saw Saha at the bottom of the 
8-foot-deep pool. They immediately called 
911. 
Saha’s body was pulled out of the pool 
by GPD Officer Ahipo Doualehi. Gainesville Fire Rescue administered CPR, but Saha 
was pronounced dead at UF Health Shands 
Hospital’s emergency room.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said 
although alcohol was likely a factor, offi-
cers did not suspect foul play.
Susan Huang, a 20-year-old UF journal-
ism junior who lives at Stoneridge, said she 
found out about the drowning after it oc-
curred when a friend texted her.
“It’s definitely eerie thinking about 
swimming in a pool that someone died in,” Huang said.
Stoneridge management said they could 
not comment on the situation. 
Saha’s last Facebook profile picture fea-
tured a quote from the Pink Floyd song 
“Comfortably Numb.”
“There is no pain, you are receding,” the 
quote reads. “A distant ship’s smoke on the

The George A. Smathers Library 
and the Levin College of Law will host 
events to celebrate Constitution Day to-day. Both events are open and free to the public.
UF’s Levin College of Law will have 
a panel discussion at the Martin H. Levin Advocacy Center starting at noon,  with prominent speakers talking about “National Security and Privacy After Snowden.”
Smathers Library will have tables set 
up on the Library West Colonnade from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Attendees can write 
on a board what they think should be 
changed or added to the U.S. Constitu-tion.  
“It’s a simple exercise to bring aware-
ness to the constitution,” said Barbara Hood, director of communications at Smathers Library. “A lot of people don’t know what’s in the constitution.”
Constitution Day is a way to com-
memorate the signing of the constitu-tion, Hood said.  Pocket constitutions and cake will also be given out at the 
Smathers event.
UF’s Levin College of Law will have 
speakers such as Senior District Judge 
Roger Vinson of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida and Sandra Chance, a UF journalism profes-sor and executive director of the Brech-ner Center for Freedom of Information. 
Jon Mills, director for UF Law’s Cen-
ter for Governmental Responsibility, said the panel discussion will allow the audience to ask the speakers questions. Mills will also take part in the conversa-tion. 
The law panel will explore issues such 
as wiretapping citizens and the NSA col-lecting data on phone calls, Mills said.
“The constitution protects every 
citizen from search and seizure, and the government can’t wiretap without a warrant,” he said. “We hope interested grad students and undergraduate stu-dents come to see it.” UF hosts Constitution Day

Edmund Kellerman’s ﬁ  rst semester teach-
ing at UF in 1993 got off to a rocky start.  He 
had to fail one of his students who drank so much that he couldn’t keep up with his class-es.  
“It broke my heart,” said Kellerman, a se-
nior lecturer in the Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication.
Since then, he has spoken to all his classes 
about the consequences of excessive drinking for the past 21 years.
This year his warnings went digital, when 
his Introduction to Communications course transferred into an online class.
Generally before the ﬁ  rst football game, 
Kellerman makes a statement on his e-Learn-ing course page for his students to “have a good time but remember, we will always mea-sure you by your restraint, not by how much 
liquor you can consume.” 
Due to the recent assaults on campus, 
Kellerman wants his students to be safe. In his 
most recent post, he mentioned drinking and sexual assaults.
“If you are involved with 
alcohol, you are four times more likely to be sexually assaulted or physically as-saulted,” he said.
Maureen Miller, the di-
rector of GatorWell, said heavy drinking during 
football games can be dan-
gerous.
“Drinking in general has a variety of con-
sequences such as vomiting, passing out and getting into ﬁ  ghts,” she said.
If students are going to drink at games, 
they should pace themselves, she said.
Kimberly Miller, a 19-year-old UF public 
relations sophomore, said she has seen less 
drinking on campus.
“If I’m intoxicated all the time, how am I 
going to remember college?” she said. 
For Kellerman, drinking at social events 
should be done in moderation. Kellerman said he will be sending out another announcement before the homecoming game. 
“I’m doing this because I care,” he said. UF professor warns students about excessive drinking in email
� ASTRONAUTS HAVE BEEN GOING 
THROUGH RUSSIA IN RECENT YEARS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — NASA is a giant step 
closer to launching Americans again from U.S. soil.
On Tuesday, the space agency picked Boeing and 
SpaceX to transport astronauts to the International 
Space Station in the next few years.
NASA Administrator Charles Bolden named the 
winners of the competition at Kennedy Space Cen-ter, next door to where the launches should occur in a few years. The wall behind him was emblazoned with the words “Launch America” and “Commercial crew transportation/The mission is in sight.”
“I want you to look behind me,” Bolden said, point-
ing both thumbs to the big, bright logos. “I’m giddy today, I will admit.”
The deal will end NASA’s expensive reliance on 
Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space sta-tion. NASA has set a goal of 2017 for the ﬁ  rst launch from Cape Canaveral, but stressed it will not sacriﬁ  ce safety to meet that date.
NASA will pay Boeing $4.2 billion and SpaceX $2.6 
billion to certify, test and ﬂ  y their crew capsules. The two contracts call for two to six missions for a crew of four, as well as supplies and scientiﬁ  c experiments, said NASA’s Kathy Lueders, commercial crew pro-gram manager. The spacecrafts will double as emer-gency lifeboats at the orbiting outpost.
SpaceX billionaire founder and chief executive, 
Elon Musk, was elated by Tuesday’s news, as were Boeing’s top managers.
“Deeply honored and appreciative of the trust that 
NASA has placed in SpaceX for the future of human spaceﬂ  ight,” Musk said in a tweet.
Noted Boeing’s John Elbon, vice president and 
general manager of space exploration: “Boeing has been part of every American human spaceﬂ  ight pro-
gram, and we’re honored that NASA has chosen us to 
continue that legacy.”
The third major contender, Sierra Nevada Corp., 
had the most novel entry: a mini-shuttle named Dream Chaser that it was developing in Colorado.
U.S. astronauts have been riding Russian rockets 
ever since NASA’s space shuttles retired in 2011. The latest price tag is $71 million per seat. 
NASA puts at least four of its astronauts on a Rus-
sian Soyuz every year. SpaceX has indicated its seats will cost $20 million apiece.
“From day one, the Obama administration has 
made it very clear that the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on any other nation to get into space,” Bolden told reporters.
The commercial crew program follows the success-
ful cargo delivery effort underway for the past two years, also under NASA contract. NASA is prepping 
its ﬁ  rst-ever Orion deep-space exploration capsule for 
an unmanned test ﬂ  ight in December.
Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said Boeing alone will 
add 550 jobs to Cape Canaveral, welcome news for a region still struggling economically from the shuttle shutdown.
NASA astronaut Mike Fincke noted that while the 
capsules may be small, they’re carrying “big expecta-tions.”NASA picks Boeing and SpaceX to 
ferry astronauts to space from USKellerman

UF football players celebrate following Florida’s 36-30 triple-overtime win against Kentucky on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Florida is a two-touchdown underdog for its game against Alabama on Saturday.
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
If you listen to Las Vegas, the Gators have little shot 
against the Crimson Tide Saturday. 
The fine folks at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas had 
Florida as a 19-point underdog on Sunday when it 
first posted a number — most other sportsbooks had 
UF as a 17-point dog. 
That number has since been knocked down to be-
tween 14 and 15 depending on where you look.
If the sharks and casual fans with disposable in-
come or a bit of an addiction don’t think UF is that 
bad, the mood in the locker room is even more opti-mistic.
“Like we said from the beginning, we’re all we got 
and we’re all we need,” offensive lineman Max Gar-
cia said. “We don’t need anyone else’s opinion or ap-
proval. We don’t need anyone else’s confidence in us. We have our confidence in ourselves and this team and this program. That’s just the way it’s going to be. People are writing us off, but that’s just how we want it. We’re going to go in there and compete.”
Garcia shuns the notion that any victory over Ala-
bama will be dumb luck for the Gators but more ac-curately a byproduct of realizing their potential and 
executing what they need to do to produce the desired 
result.
On Monday, coach Will Muschamp said the Gators Florida not fazed by underdog label as ‘Bama game nears
“We don’t need anyone else’s confidence 
in us. We have our confidence in ourselves 
and this team and this program.”

UF offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper remembers the last time a team 
he coached played against Alabama.
In 2010, Roper — then Duke’s 
offensive coordinator — faced the Crimson Tide when they came to Durham, N.C., to take on the Blue 
Devils at home in 2010.
“That was a long day,” Roper said. 
“13 (points), I think we had.”
Thirteen was in fact all the Blue 
Devils’ offense could manage to get on the board. Alabama rolled to a 62-13 victory. 
On top of that, the Duke defense was 
graced with stopping Mark Ingram — the reigning Heisman Trophy winner 
from 2009 — in his first game back 
following his Heisman win. 
On top of that, the secondary had 
to deal with lethal wideout Julio Jones. Roper had to relive the blow-
out loss this week.
“That was an interesting ball-
game,” Roper said.
“If I’m remembering 100 percent 
correctly, Mark Ingram, it was his 
first game back from a knee (injury) or something like that. So he had ac-tually sat out a couple of games. And Notebook: Roper reminisces

Florida baseball had a sour end to its 
2014 campaign.
After winning the Southeastern Con-
ference regular-season title for the 13th 
time in program history and earning the 
No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the 
Gators’ season came to a skidding halt in the Gainesville Regional after going two-and-out in the tournament for the second straight year.
But even after losing 3-2 to College of 
Charleston and then 5-2 to North Carolina to cap off the season, Florida coach Kevin O’Sullivan did not dwell on the negatives of how the season ended.
“I don’t want these last two games to 
be a reflection of what this team is about,” O’Sullivan said after the loss to UNC on May 31. “We accomplished a lot, and I know in this day and age you’re always judged on how you do in the postseason — I understand that. But as far as the people in that locker room, and our coaches and our staff, and the people that are involved with our program, we’re gonna be awful proud about what we accomplished this year.”
UF released its 2015 
schedule on Tuesday, and its road to the NCAA 
Tournament will be any-
thing but easy.
Florida faces five teams 
that finished the season ranked in the top 25 of the 
Baseball America poll — No. 1 Vanderbilt, No. 3 
Ole Miss, No. 19 Florida State, No. 23 Miami and No. 25 South Carolina.
The Gators also face the task of replac-
ing two key starters in Taylor Gushue and Casey Turgeon, who opted to forgo their senior seasons and sign with the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals, respective-ly.
During his three-year tenure at Florida, 
Gushue started 162 games and posted a ca-
reer .274 batting average with 16 home runs Florida releases 2015 schedule,

UF punter on if having confidence helps improve his punting
it was Marcell Dareus’ first game back. ... So early 
in that game they give it to Mark Ingram and he scores. Next thing Julio Jones scores. You’re talking 
about first-rounders here.”
While some coaches may put game tape of a 
dominating loss on the shelf, Roper said he watched 
the game again to make adjustments and gather 
intel on teams similar to Alabama — as the Saban 
coaching tree can be found across college football.
“I’ve watched it since then to try to learn any-
thing from it, but we felt like, for that season, that really hurt us for a couple of weeks, that was tough 
to get over,” Roper said. “But you’re talking about a 
bunch of first-rounders running around out there.”
Driskel’s Time to Use His Feet: Florida quar-
terback Jeff Driskel, identified as a true dual threat 
quarterback, has done little with his run game in 
the Gators’ first two games of 2014.
The redshirt junior has just seven carries for 24 
yards.
Offensively, the formula to beat a Saban-led 
Alabama team in recent years has consisted of two 
things — an up-tempo offensive scheme and a quar-
terback that can kill you with his ability to run. 
The last two SEC teams to beat the Tide in recent 
years exemplified these traits: 2012’s Texas A&M, 
and last year’s Auburn team. 
The quarterbacks in those Tide losses — Johnny 
Manziel and Nick Marshall — rushed for a com-
bined 191 yards in their wins.
“I think it all depends on the structure of the 
defense. It’s something that obviously he’s got the ability to do. The more you see him run, the better he gets.” Roper said. “I think he’s a guy that ob-
viously possesses that ability to use him. We still 
want to be smart.”Roper also added that the offense didn’t call it 
much during the offseason and spring football dur-ing the installation of the new system, because those weren’t specifically live snaps.
Christy has renewed confidence: Kyle Christy 
made a name for himself in 2012.
The then-sophomore punter was a finalist for the 
Ray Guy Award, which is given annually to the best punter in college football.
One year later, he struggled and was eventually 
benched for freshman Johnny Townsend.
“We don’t hold it against each other if one of us 
is punting good or one of us is punting bad,” Chris-ty said. “So I’d say we have a good relationship.”
But against Kentucky on Saturday, Christy re-
turned to his 2012 form, being named the SEC Spe-cial Teams Player of the Week on monday after av-eraging 48.7 yards per punt on six attempts against the Wildcats. 
“Kyle Christy punted the ball extremely well,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “...Really flipped the field and early in the game.
Four of Christy’s punts landed inside the UK 20-
yard line.
His final punt went for 61 yards, his longest since 
hitting a 62-yarder against South Carolina on Oct. 20, 2012. 
On the season, Christy is averaging 48.6 yards 
per punt, good for first in the SEC and fifth in the 
country.
After going through an up-and-down 2013 cam-
paign, Christy said he reached out to Philadelphia Eagles’ punter Donnie Jones during his slump.
“He said he struggled a lot his junior year and 
lost his starting spot, too, and then came back strong 
his senior year,” Christy said. 
“Now, obviously, he is doing good in the NFL. 
So it was good to know I wasn’t the only one it’s ever happened to.”and 103 RBIs.
The catcher paced UF with 71 hits, 16 doubles, six 
home runs, 49 RBIs and a .467 slugging percentage 
in 2014. Gushue led the SEC in league play with a .389 clip at the plate and was en route to first-team All-SEC and second-team All-America honors.
Turgeon started 185 games — including 177 at 
second base — during his three-year career at Flor-ida, finishing with a .269 batting average with 112 runs, 95 RBIs and 13 home runs. In his junior cam-paign, the Palm Harbor, Fla., native had a team-high 
35 walks last season while also being second with 36 
runs, 33 RBIs, 11 doubles and four home runs.
had a decided advantage 
because of quarterback Jeff Driskel’s comfort with pres-sure situations and experience at quarterback.
It’s something that helps 
to neutralize the detriment caused by wide-eyed fresh-men awed by the mystique surrounding the house the Bear built.
“Yeah, I think Jeff is going 
to be pretty solid in the pock-et if we protect for him early 
on,” Garcia said. “He’ll build 
that confidence and take those shots down the field that we didn’t capitalize on last week. It’ll make some big plays and really excited to use him to his fullest capability.”
Garcia’s fellow offensive 
lineman Chaz Green was on 
the field against Alabama the 
last time it faced off against Florida in Gainesville. 
He started the game, and 
was on the field for the open-ing play of the game when quarterback John Brantley connected with wide receiver Andre Debose for the game’s 
opening score. Green was also on the field the last time Flori-
da traveled to Alabama. 
Although he did not play in 
that 2011 matchup, when they returned home they were a beaten bunch only mustering six points in a 25-point loss. 
Green was a wide-eyed 
freshman then just like many 
of his teammates are now.
“It’s going to be a crazy 
environment,” Green said. 
“Last time I went there I was a freshman. I was a redshirt. I didn’t play. It was a crazy en-vironment, real hectic. Very, very loud. They have good fan support. It’s just some-
thing that we have to prepare 
for. Make sure that everyone knows what they’re doing. Again, communication is go-ing to be an issue with the noise.”
Green’s right. It will be 
loud when 101,000 fans pack Bryant Denney on Satur-
day afternoon to watch the 
Tide play the role of favorite against a Gators team hoping to be a spoiler. But the Gators aren’t angling to play the role of spoiler if the definition has anything to do with the vic-tory being some sort of a sur-prise.Experienced QB gives

Florida’s offensive line was in-
consistent in its 36-30 triple-over-
time win against Kentucky on Sat-urday.
After losing starting left tackle 
D.J. Humphries (ankle) one week earlier, UF’s front five struggled early against the Wildcats and al-lowed seven quarterback hurries, five tackles behind the line of scrim-mage and two sacks.
Miscommunications forced 
quarterback Jeff Driskel to be quick on his reads at times, forcing the 
redshirt junior to get rid of the ball 
earlier than he anticipated.
But despite the rough start and 
the issues that ensued, offensive 
coordinator Kurt Roper was im-pressed with how the offensive 
line regained its form as UF’s first 
Southeastern Conference contest progressed.
“With what Kentucky was doing 
to us and for us to go in and rush for 230 yards was really a credit to them,” Roper said. “I mean, they were a physical group the other 
night and they’ve been sore the last 
couple days because it was one of those games, but they did a really good job.”
And with the Gators (2-0, 1-0 
SEC) traveling to Tuscaloosa, Ala., to face the No. 3 Crimson Tide this weekend, Florida will face its sec-ond tough test in the trenches in as 
many weeks.
Alabama (3-0) boasts a deep de-
fensive front, rotating players often 
to keep them fresh.
Sophomore defensive lineman 
Jonathan Allen leads the Crimson Tide with four tackles for loss, and Alabama has 10 other players who are credited with at least sharing a tackle behind the line of scrim-mage. Linebackers Xzavier Dickson and Ryan Anderson each have two sacks this season. 
“They’re deep across the board,” 
offensive lineman Chaz Green said. 
“They have good talent and they’re 
also coached well, they bring a lot of different fronts. It’s something we definitely have to pay attention to this week with film and at prac-tice.”
Green, who shifted from right 
tackle to left tackle on Saturday due to Humphries’ injury, admitted to having struggled with his technique early against the Wildcats, but felt better as the game proceeded.
“The first half I had some issues 
cutting off the back side,” Green said. “We knew that was going to be an issue last week with the 
scheme that they ran with those 
ends.”
Center Max Garcia, the unspo-
ken leader of the offensive line, respected how the linemen played against Kentucky, especially Flori-da’s guards.
“They did a good job, just listen-
ing to my call,” the redshirt senior said. “They were on the same page with me. They pulled like every other play, they were doing a lot of running that people don’t really realize you know the type of effect that has on conditioning and them 
running sideline to sideline it takes 
a toll on your body.”

One year after repeating 
as champions of the Cougar 
Classic in Charleston, S.C., the Florida women’s golf team finished in 12th place 
after the final round with a 
team score of 294.
The No. 17 Gators complet-
ed the final day at 6-over-par and ended the tournament at 25-over-par, which was 43 shots behind the winner of the event, Southeastern Con-ference foe, No. 7 Arkansas. 
Arkansas shot 18-under-par 
as a team, and won by seven strokes over No. 2 UCLA. 
Sophomore Kelly Grassel 
was the most consistent play-er for UF over the three days, as she finished at 5-over-par and shot a 75 (+3) on the final day. Grassel ended her first 
tournament as a Gator in a 
tie for 38th place.
Junior Ursa Orehek had 
her best round of the week as she completed the third round at even-par. Orehek moved up 25 spots on the leaderboard to finish in a tie for 59th place. She ended the 
three-day event at 10-over-
par.
Freshman Taylor Tomlin-
son fired her best round of her collegiate career on the third day. She completed her round at even-par as well. The Gainesville native shot a 77 and a 78 in the first two 
days before her even-par 72 
on the last day of the event.
Even though the Gators 
struggled as a team overall in the three day tournament, coach Emily Glaser said the performances of Orehek and Tomlinson on the final day will help the team as they 
move forward.
“Overall, it wasn’t a great event for us, 
but despite that, we will take a lot of 
positives from our experi-ence,” Glaser said in a re-
lease. “I’m happy that Tay-
lor and Ursa finished strong today. Everyone contributed this week and everyone had their own individual suc-cesses even though the scores weren’t great.” 
A day after shooting a 
1-under 71, sophomore Karo-
lina Vlckova struggled on the 
final day, as she ended up shooting 8-over-par. Vlckova dropped 34 spots on the lea-derboard from a tie in 19th place to a tie for 53rd.
Senior Camilla Hedberg, 
who won the tournament as an individual two years 
ago as a sophomore, com-
pleted the three day event at 10-over-par and in a tie for 59th place with Orehek after shooting a 3-over, 75 on the final day. When Hedberg won the tournament, she shot 13-under-par and won by four strokes. It was also 
Hedberg’s first individual 
win as a member of the UF golf team.
As a team, Florida shot 
889, which is 30 strokes worse than the team number of 859 the Gators shot one year ago in Charleston. 
Glaser said she expects 
the team to learn from the first tournament and move forward as the team heads into their second tournament of the fall season in October at Chapel Hill, N.C.
“We have a lot to work 
on over the next few weeks before the Tar Heel Invita-
tional,” Glaser said, “and I 
feel confident that we can improve.”Florida Golf team

After having a week off to improve after a 
disappointing 13th place finish in its first tour-
nament, the Florida men’s golf team is coming off its qualifying rounds for the Wolf Run In-tercollegiate in Zionsville, Ind. 
And an unheralded freshman, Ryan Cel-
ano, won the qualifying after three days of play. 
“We really needed someone to step up and 
grab a spot and (Celano) did that, shot 65 in the first round which was awesome to see,” Deacon said. “I’m really looking forward to see how he performs on the road and see how he can help us this weekend in Indiana.”
Celano won the qualifying after building 
up a big lead after the first round. He led by seven shots after the first day and 
increased it to an eight-shot advantage after the second round of play. 
In the final round, Celano shot a 76 but hung 
on and won the qualifying by four strokes. 
Celano went up against an older team, but 
as a freshman was able to come out on top and will contribute for UF in the second tourna-ment.
“I can’t wait to see him on the road this week, it’s a long hard golf course we’re go-ing to play. … he has that fire and he wants to compete and we really needed him to step up 
and he did do that,” Deacon said.
Having success is nothing new to Celano. 
In his prep career, he placed second as an in-
dividual at the 2011 FHSAA 1A State Cham-pionship. 
The Naples, Fla., native was also named 
the Naples Daily News Area Player of the Year four times. 
Celano followed up his successful prep ca-
reer with an amateur career that included win-ning the individual title at the Lemon Bay Golf Club on the 2013 Florida Junior Golf Tour. 
Celano earned a berth in the 2013 U.S. Am-
ateur, winning the qualifier after shooting a 67 in the first round and 71 on the final day of play.
After struggling in the first tournament of 
the fall, Deacon kept reminding the players 
throughout the week off that finishing at the 
bottom of the leaderboard was unacceptable and they have to improve. 
Having a player like Celano will only help 
their play heading into Zionsville.
“I think it’s going to really help having 
Ryan Celano, he went out and earned a spot, we have everyone qualifying on the team and the top two players in the qualifying get a 
spot, and Ryan went out and earned it,” Dea-
con said. 
“I didn’t have to pick him and give him a 
spot, so that was huge. I think he’s going to add a lot of energy, he’s got a ton of power and he’s really going to help us.” Freshman solid in qualifying rounds prior to Indiana tourneyUF Golf
