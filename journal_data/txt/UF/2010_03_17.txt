Mayoral candidate Craig Lowe awaits election results at the Supervisor of Elections Office on Tuesday
night.By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
After Tuesday's city election,
Gainesville voters were hoping
to get a new mayor and city com-
missioner.
Instead, they're getting anoth-
er election.
In the race for Gainesville
mayor and a District 4 City
Commission seat, no candidate
received the 50-percent plus one
vote necessary to avoid a runoff.
The top two candidates in each
race will have to make their case
to the voters one last time.
In the mayoral race, City Com-
missioner Craig Lowe secured 40
percent of votes cast while local
business owner Don Marsh re-
ceived 29 percent.
"I'm very gratified by the re-
sults," Lowe said. "I'm very en-
ergized to continue a very posi-
tive, progressive, future-oriented
campaign.
In the District 4 City Com-
mission race, Randy Wells got
47 percent of the vote, topping
Penny Wheat's 37 percent.
With his wife by his side and
his daughter in his arms, Wells
expressed gratitude for his sup-porters and vowed to continue
his outreach to voters.
"It's going to take more knock-
ing on doors," Wells said. "(Peo-
ple) won't be surprised to see
my face for the second or third
time."
The other candidates for city
commission were Mason Alley,
Pat Fitzpatrick and Nathaniel
Sperling, who collectively re-
ceived 15 percent of the vote.
"I'm very gratified by the
results. I'm very energized
to continue a very positive,
progressive, future-orient-
ed campaign."
Craig Lowe
mayoral candidate
Of the 72,623 registered voters
in Alachua County, 10,167, or 14
percent, cast their ballots.
Although the turnout was less
than the 25 percent that Alachua
County Supervisor of Elections
Pam Carpenter hoped for, it was
an increase from the 10.7 percent
of eligible voters who turned out
for the 2007 mayoral election.

Alligator Contributing Writer

sic and Entertainment.This is the singer's first appearance at
UF, Crespin said.
A native of Winston-Salem, N.C., Folds
has been part of the music scene for 15 years.

Students, faculty talk buses
By GLENN COINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students are sick of waiting, and they're
tired of walking.
Students and UF faculty and staff ex-
pressed their transporation concerns at the
first of two forums Tuesday with UF and the
Gainesville Regional Transit System. The fo-
rum was held so residents to offer input for
consideration in the transportation compo-
nent of the 2010-2020 Campus Master Plan.
About 18 people attended the first fo-
rum.
Florida legislature requires state univer-
sities to submit a Campus Master Plan up-
date every five years, outlining project and
budget proposals. The transportation com-
ponent is funded separately but is being run
in coordination with the federally required
five-year update for the Gainesville Urban-
ized Area 2035 Long Range Transportation
Plan.
The Renaissance Planning Group, an in-
dependent consulting firm, has been con-
tracted by the university and by RTS to
manage these projects.
Whit Blanton, vice president of Renais-
sance and project manager for the transpor-
tation element of UF's plan, said the coor-dination of the metropolitan and university
planning holds great advantages, particu-
larly cost efficiency.
According to Blanton, the university is
paying Renaissance a little over $100,000.
During the forum, Doug Robinson, chief
transit planner for Gainesville RTS, ad-
dressed areas for improvement within the
campus and metro bus systems like comfort,
convenience, reliability and sustainability.
He then discussed several proposed so-
lutions including bus rapid transit. This
would essentially be an express bus that
would run faster using dedi-
On cated lanes and/or the abilityCampus to change red lights or delay
green ones.
The possibility of a streetcar running
from campus to downtown was also men-
tioned, but as a long-term goal.
Audience members were asked to draw
in and make note of additions and revisions
they would like to see.
Blanton said students could expect to see
some changes as soon as the end of the year.
The bigger the change, he said, the longer it
will take.
Robinson said RTS is working on con-
verting the entire fleet of city buses to run
on biodiesel like the campus ones. He said
this should be completed by 2011.Earth Day events kick off

Earth Day is celebrating its 40th
birthday, and Gainesville residents are
invited to a 40-day party.
The UF Office of Sustainability is
sponsoring 40 Days of Change, which
includes sustainability-focused ac-
tivities on campus and throughout the
Gainesville area.
Although Earth Day falls on April

The campaign kicked off Tuesday
at the Reitz Union Colonnade and
North Lawn, where students partici-
pated in recycling-themed crafts and
learned about upcoming events.
Campaign activities include the 10-
day Gainesville Environmental Film
and Arts Festival at the Hippodrome
and walking tours of Paynes Prairieevery Thursday, said Stephanie Sims,
program assistant for the Office of Sus-
tainability.
"It's important to know
where food comes from,
where it goes and how it's
recycled."
Jordan Weinstein

Jordan Weinstein, an intern at the

Gators for a Sustainable Campus.
Weinstein said students should
pay attention to the sources of their
food and how it's made.
"It's important to know where food
comes from, where it goes and how it's
recycled," she said.
The Earth Day Celebration is April
21 on the Plaza of the Americas, where
President Bernie Machen will give the

Study suggests soda, pizza tax

Although the tax is unlikely to Leonardo's Pizza out of business.
Some researchers want to fatten
pizza and soda costs in hopes that
it will slim America's waistline.
A study published Monday in
the Archives of Internal Medicine
argues for an 18 percent tax on
pizza and soda.
The study estimated the tax
would decrease calorie intake, on
average, by 56 calories daily.
"At the population level, de-
clines of 56 [calories] per day
would be associated with a reduc-
tion of roughly 5 [pounds] per
adult per year and significant re-
ductions in the risks of most obe-
sity-related chronic diseases," the
report wrote.
Maurice Marshall, a UF food
science professor, said while he
agrees America is facing health
issues, he doesn't believe pizza is
the biggest problem food.
"A pizza here and there has its
place, obviously in moderation,"
said Marshall. "I would pick on
savory snacks, chips and snacks
like that. At least a pizza has nutri-
tional value. You can buy a whole-
wheat crust, and it offers some
cheeses and some meats. Pizza has
a couple of things on the food pyr-
amid. I'm not sure what [potato
chips] offer in terms of nutritional
benefit."
David Denslow, a UF econom-
ics professor, compared the tax on
soda to a tax passed on beer in the
early 1990s.
As for pizza, Denslow thinks
if a tax passed, pizza restaurants
would find ways to make "pizza-
like food" that is not called "piz-a
za" to avoid the taxes.

* ABOUT 63 PERCENT OF GAINESVILLE
RESIDENTS COMPLETED THE CENSUS IN 2000.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Census forms started arriving in mailboxes this week,
and Alachua County officials are encouraging everyone,
including students, to participate by filling out and mail-
ing in the form that is required by law.
The Census, which is conducted every 10 years, deter-
mines how legislative districts will be drawn, how U.S.
House of Representatives seats will be apportioned and
how federal funds will be distributed.
Norman Sassner, local Census office manager, said it
is important that UF students participate because they at-
tend a state-run school.
"The more students participate, the more
[the] funds are going to increase by that
News number," Sassner said.
He added it's necessary students fill out
the form in Gainesville if that's where they are living,
even if it is not their permanent residence.
The 23rd census form, the shortest ever, contains 10
questions.
All information collected, including names, addresses
and phone numbers, is confidential, according to Sass-
ner.
About 63 percent of Gainesville residents participated
in the 2000 Census, which ties Florida's average participa-
tion rate but falls below the national average of 67 per-
cent, according statistics on the Web site for the Census'
Bureau.
Census workers make up to three trips to each home
that has not submitted a Census form between April and
July.
According to the Census Bureau Web site, regional
Census bureaus will deliever the Census information to
the president for apportionment in December.

Bad Barbie
New toy sends wrong
message to childrenShe's at it again. Our favorite anatomically incorrect ca-
reer hopper is adding another hobby to her already
formidable list -promoting the purchase of animals.
Last week, Mattel announced a new Plush Pals line, fea-
turing Blissa the kitten, Lacey the Chihuahua puppy and
Sequin the poodle.
Well, in case you haven't noticed, shelters aren't exactly
overflowing with Chihuahua puppies and poodles.
The toys, 10-inch plushes with cramped, matching car-
riers, condition little girls to want designer dogs and treat
pets like accessories (and for Barbie, that's exactly what
they are).
Mattel could have easily presented the pets as rescued
animals. They could have invented past abuse or neglect
and allowed children to "save" them.
Instead, as usual, they took the cute, easy route and con-
tributed to the nationwide epidemic of animal overpopula-
tion. That's not even the only problem -studies show that
purebred animals are less healthy than "mutts" or mixed
breeds. But we get it -only the best for Barbie.
Until Americans acknowledge that it's a problem for ani-
mals to die in shelters while people (and dolls) buy pets, the
problem is not going to get better.
If Barbie had forgone the puppy mills and adopted a pit
bull, a mutt, or even an adult Chihuahua, we might feel dif-
ferently.
But once again, like when she got knocked up (we don't
see a commitment ring on those webbed fingers) or decided
to become a unicorn, Barbie made a dumb choice.

10, not for lack of funding or
space, but because Constance
McMillen, a lesbian student,
wanted to wear a tuxedo and
bring her girlfriend.
Although the school board
was probably just trying to
skirt the issue of denying the
two students' entry, its mem-
bers have unfairly punished
McMillen and the other stu-
dents. Halting the tradition
less than a month before the
scheduled date offers McMil-
len up to the actions of her
angered classmates, many of
whom already bought their
clothes for the event.
If the school board's ac-
tions don't count as intention-al retaliation, they remain sad
reminders that people often
scratch their heads over how
to mesh tradition and mo-
dernity. And they sometimes
make the wrong decision.
In this case, officials
learned that when the rights
of a group of people are con-
cerned, there's no half-hearted
compromise to satisfy every-
one. The choices remain either
to grant equality or to keep
stoking the country's embers
of discrimination. There is a
ray of hope, though.
The American Civil Liber-
ties Union of Mississippi has
stepped in to fix the situation
by suing for reinstatement.
Americans can only hope
the court's decision will
acknowledge all our First
Amendment rights. Whether
a Mississippi school board re-
alizes it, we don't have to stop
saying, doing or being what
we wish to make others com-
fortable or happy.

Alligator weighs gi
ollowing the controversial shooting of Ghanian
graduate assistant Kofi Adu-Brempong by Univer-
sity Police, Students for a Democratic Society pre-
sented a list of demands to Vice President of Student Af-
fairs Patricia Telles-Irvin. Listed below are these demands
followed by the Editorial Board's recommendations.
1. Drop all charges against Adu-Brempong and pay for
his medical bills. 2. Oversight of the investigation by a neu-
tral party. 3. Termination of UPD officer Keith Smith. 4. A
review board, consisting of students, faculty and police, to
analyze UPD's use-of-force policy. 5. Improvement of UF's
mental health and crisis services.
While we fully agree with Alachua County Judge Denise
Ferrero's order to have the original charges, including one
count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without
intent to kill, refiled due to a lack of probable cause, we can-
not support or reject any recommendations with Adu-Brem-
pong's current charges of aggravated assault on an officer
and resisting an officer with violence until after the investiga-
tion into the incident is complete and we have more informa-
tion. Adu-Brempong's medical costs will continue to be paid
for by the Department of Jail while he is under its control.
President Machen was right in appointing Margolis,
Healy & Associates, the same public safety organization that
investigated Virginia Tech's massacre, to review the shoot-
ing. This is too complex an incident to rely on an internal in-
vestigation, and we have faith this organization will shed un-
biased light on an event that has cloaked UF's campus with
protests, outrage and disdain for public officials.
We at the Editorial Board don't feel we have the authority
to recommend firing a public official, but we do question why
the officer who shot Adu-Brempong, Keith Smith, who was
involved in a 2009 incident in which police officers harassed
and threw eggs at residents, was even in this position.
According to UF spokesman Steve Orlando, Smith was
put on paid leave following the shooting and is now on paid
administrative duty. We feel he should be suspended with-

letters@alligator orgout pay.
We support the fourth and fifth
demands. UPD's use-of-force policy
has been questioned since the Taser-
ing of Andrew Meyer in 2007 sparked
national outrage.
An internal analysis of UPD's 2009 use-of-force policy
shows UPD reviewed 18 incidents. Eleven of those involved
a police officer drawing a firearm.
According to UPD, only four of those 11 incidents in-
volved situations where police thought the suspect had ei-
ther a gun or knife. However, UPD used a Taser only one
time in 2009, which is a decrease from eight times in 2007.
UPD attributes the decrease to its current Taser policy,
which states "suspects must be transferring from active
physical resistance to aggressive physical resistance."
While we advocate for the safety of our police officers and
for their ability to protect themselves and the citizens they
serve, we do question the use of force needed against a single
man stricken with polio as a child, causing him to walk with
a cane. According to police, Adu-Brempong swung a metal
rod and threatened them with a knife, causing police to stun
Adu-Brempong with a beanbag gun and a faulty Taser de-
ployment. If Adu-Brempong did swing a metal rod at police,
this would warrant UPD to deploy Tasers, according to poli-
cy. But some suggest the rod was his cane. We also question
why he was shot in the jaw rather than a safer location.
Lastly, we feel an improvement in the understanding and
knowledge of mental health and crisis services on campus
is a welcome addition to our inclusive campus. We believe
UPD and GPD should make crisis intervention training man-
datory and place heavier emphasis on its importance.
Above all, the Editorial Board looks forward to the results
of the independent review so we can understand what hap-
pened and who was at fault for the circumstances that have
engulfed UF's campus and drawn national scrutiny.

Letter to the Editor
Audio tapes should inspire students to vote
On March 4, the Alligator Editorial Board commented
on what they called the Unite Party's "naughty audio."
However, the editorial and the administration's silence on
this issue reveal the true problem in Student Government:
apathy.
The Alligator couldn't have said it better: "The vast re-
mainder of the Student Body is always going to not care
and not vote."
If that is how the Alligator addresses systemic coercion
and corruption within SG, it's no wonder students don't
head out to the polls. SG can be changed if students take
the initiative and cast their ballots. With less than 20 per-
cent of students voting, the Alligator should be encourag-
ing people to vote. Taking the defeatist stance that nothing
will change is just plain wrong.
These tapes deserve action. They show collusion be-
tween the Unite Party and the supposedly "non-partisan"
supervisor of elections, who is (no surprise) appointed by
Unite Party members. On top of that, they show an elabo-
rate system of coercion that goes as far as bribing voters
and denying food to pledges -what has come to be called
"hazing for votes."
The story has been covered by the Gainesville Sun and
the Alligator, whose story was featured on the Huffington
Post, but UF officials have still refused to act.
Administration: It's time to take a stand. You've always
asked for evidence of voter coercion, and now you have
it. UF students deserve a government that works in their
best interests, not one that only clings to power through
corruption.
Students: The only way to truly change this is through
the power of the pen. Write to university administrators
and tell them that enough is enough. But most important-
ly, you need to prove the administration, the Alligator and
SG wrong. This fall, take five minutes, head to the polls
and vote.

be smart about itGuest column
Jaywalkers should
wish we were all really good jaywalkers. There
may be some hardasses who think jaywalking is
wrong because it's against the law.
I sympathize with you; I used to think the same
way. After I got my license, I didn't speed for six
months because I was convinced it was disrespect-
ful to the governing authorities.
Then I realized that cars passing me on a two-lane
road late at night because I was driving the posted 25
mph was probably more unsafe than me going a little
faster. Similarly, I used to think jaywalking was bad.
Then I came to college and realized that at UF it's a
way of life.
Jaywalking can be pretty efficient if you're smart
about it. I live down an alley behind The Courtyards,
so I cross 13th Street at Second Avenue every day on
my way to class. Once the traffic stops along 13th,
the people turning left from Second Avenue get the
green light. That means that I can do the half-jaywalk
-come to almost the middle of the road so when all
the left-turning cars are past, I can finish crossing.
Worst case scenario, I'm halfway across the street
when the Ampelmann turns white. I don't even see
the blinky red hand. And if the left-turning cars fin-
ish before their turn light does, I can make it onto
campus before pedestrians are even cleared to walk.
So that's smart jaywalking. My operating princi-
ple: Don't make cars have to think about you. If you
jaywalk across University Avenue, don't chill out in
the median for minutes.
It makes drivers nervous you're going to jump
the border like a desperate Mexican (not to say that
they're bad jaywalkers at all). I meet a friend at Jim-
my John's every week, and that takes some skill. I'm
rarely actually at the crosswalk when the light turns
green, but I don't want to wait a whole cycle and
slow the traffic down University Avenue by pressing
the "I want to cross" button.
It's in everyone's best interest that I get across
now. So I find a gap and get halfway, and thenweave through the stopped cars.
They're not going anywhere.
It's all a matter of efficiency.
A lot of people who jaywalk
also drive, and vice versa,
which means in the long run,
screwing people over by being
inconsiderate will come back to
bite you.
It's the bad jaywalkers who give everyone a bum
rap. There are the obvious cases: people who com-
pletely disregard oncoming traffic with the expec-
tation that cars will stop, people who start crossing
the street right when the red hand gets serious about
you needing to stop, etc.
Then there are more complicated jaywalking
blunders. For instance, some people don't under-
stand that the half-jaywalk trick only works for one
side of the street.
If you try to walk halfway with the left-turning
cars coming toward you, you're getting in their way,
not avoiding it. But with a little practice, jaywalking
becomes a more natural skill.
I've jaywalked with a professor before and not
even stopped our conversation about The Grapes
of Wrath. We're not dumb, just a little selfish some-
times.
So form a club, make some posters, get the word
out. We can be the best jaywalkers in the country.
There's a sign along 13th Street right before campus
that advertises how many pedestrians cars yielded
to in the last week.
Whether the numbers are made up, I don't know.
And I think it's a stupid idea, but the return ques-
tion does inspire reflection: How many cars should
pedestrians have yielded to in the last week? Hope-
fully one day we'll have harmony between drivers
and walkers and will be able to jaywalk in peace.

March Madness
CLOCKWISE FROM TOP:
Cynthia Agyemang, the sister-in-law of UF graduate student Kofi Adu-
Brempong who was shot by University Police in the jaw March 2, speaks
to protesters at Emerson Hall about Adu-Brempong's condition. Adu-
Brempong's niece and nephew also spoke at the protest.
Noan Carvalho, 9, walks with protesters from Turlington Plaza to Emer-
son Alumni Hall in a rally supporting Adu-Brempong. About 300 people
marched through campus holding signs and reciting chants like "No jus-
tice, no peace, no racist police."
Dave Schneider, one of the protest's organizers, leads the group of stu-
dents as they march down Union Road to Tigert Hall from Emerson Alum-
ni Hall. They marched to Tigert Hall to hand President Bernie Machen
and other administrators a list of demands regarding Adu-Brempong and
the University Police Department.
Protesters walk down University Avenue to Emerson Alumni Hall to speak

for about two hours before marching to Tigert Hall to protest UPD's ac-
tions against Adu-Brempong.

ity.
"We will not be silent about
this," said Kwame Glover, Adu-
Brempong's nephew, who said he
believes university police are in-
volved in a cover-up. " We're grate-
ful and we're hopeful that justice
will prevail."
When trustee Danny Ponce
emerged to address the crowd, he
said he could not promise to meet
the demands today and was met
with angry chants of "drop the
charges" and "fire Keith Smith."
"You have the university's at-
tention," Ponce said. "I can assure
that."
Organizer Dave Schneider told
the crowd to join him in a sit-in at
Emerson Hall. About 100 people
stayed behind, many missing class
to show their support.
Elikem Nyamuame, also an in-
ternational graduate student from
Ghana, said he thinks there's too
much abuse in the current system
against people of color, but feels
the real tragedy is the loss of a good
educator.The sit-in lasted for about two
and a half hours before organizers
decided to head to Tigert Hall to
read their demands.
"We're grateful and we're
hopeful that justice will
prevail."

The chants gained the attention
of Patricia Telles-Irvin, UF's vice
president for student affairs, who
emerged to accept the demands and
promised to take them to President
Machen.
UT spokesman Steve Orlando
said it would be hard to meet the
protesters' demands.
For one, UF does not have the au-
thority to drop any charges against
Adu-Brempong, as that power now
lies with the State Attorney's office.
However, Orlando said
the university applauded the
peaceful nature of the rally.
"We are an academic institution,
and we are 100 percent supportive
of freedom of expression and free-
dom of speech," Orlando said.

Student Senate calls for further shooting investigation
0 THE RESOLUTION PASSED
UNANIMOUSLY.
By ELIZABETH BEHIRMAN
Alligator Writer
Although the student protest
ended Tuesday afternoon, debate
about the University Police shooting
of UF graduate student Kofi Adu-
Brempong continued at Tuesday
night's Senate meeting.
A group of about 30 students and
concerned members of the commu-
nity attended to support a resolution
calling for an Alachua County grand
jury investigation of the shooting.
After about two and a half hours
of debate over the wording of the
legislation and whether or not it
unfairly attacked the intentions of
the entire University Police Depart-
ment, senators voted unanimously
to pass the resolution.
The original wording of the reso-
lution called for a grand jury inves-ligation of the incident. Members of
the Unite Party proposed changes to
the wording of original resolution.
They called for an investigation, but
not necessarily by a grand jury, that
could imply criminal acts by UPD.
The new resolution does call
for an investigation by an Alachua
County grand jury, but includes a
dause defending the honorable in-
tentions of UPD.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers said
the resolution should defend Adu-
Brempong and UPD.
"It denies any notion that UPD in
any way intended to cause a tragedy
or sought to inflict harm on any hu-
man being and had no other inten-
tion than to protect the University of
Florida Student Body," he said.
Dave Schneider, one of the orga-
nizers of Tuesday's protest, said a
grand jury investigation simply al-
lows the public to know the details
of what happened at the shooting.
"I'm urging [senators] to say this
is unacceptable," Schneider said.Thomas Plevik/ Alligator

385 plants found at pot activist's burgled home
SEATTLE -Sheriff's deputies said they
found 385 marijuana plants at the home of an
outspoken medical marijuana activist who
nearly killed a robber in a shootout this week.
It's not clear whether the man will face charg-
es, even though he far exceeded the state's
presumptive 15-plant limit.
Sgt. John Urquhart, a King County sheriff's
office spokesman, said Tuesday that investi-
gators also found marijuana products such as
butter, baked goods and paraphernalia at the
home of Steve Sarich, who uses pot for back
pain and runs CannaCare.
Sarich, 59, awoke early Monday to find
intruders in his home. He shot one, sending
him to the hospital in critical condition, and
suffered shotgun pellet wounds to his faceand arm when another intruder returned fire.
Four young men and a teenage boy are in cus-
tody.
Deputies left Sarich 48 ounces of dried bud
and 30 plants for him and his girlfriend but
seized everything else, Urquhart said. They
had no plans to arrest him but said they would
forward their findings to prosecutors.
Nevertheless, Sarich said he was steamed
about having the plants, computers and other
items seized, and his home trashed by inves-
tigators who dumped dirt from pots onto the
floors. He insisted CannaCare's operation is
legal and many of the plants would be pro-
vided to other marijuana patients.
Sarich vowed to sue the sheriff's office.
"If I'm not safe, no patient is safe. It's not
like nobody knows what I do," he said.
The case highlights the confusion of Wash-THE ASSOCIATED PRESS only provide marijuana to one other patient at
any time -a provision that could get Sarich
in trouble. But the law doesn't specifically
prohibit patients from growing their marijua-
na together in one location to save money on
lights or other expensive equipment.
CannaCare has 7,000 members in the state,
Sarich said. It helps patients with legal advice,
runs clinics where patients can meet with
doctors who authorize marijuana use, pro-
vides patients with marijuana clones or starter
plants and delivers about 50 patients a week
with usable marijuana, he said.
King CountyProsecutorDanSatterberghas
repeatedly said he's not interested in bringing
sick people to court on marijuana charges if
they're trying to comply with the law.
Aaron Pelley, Sarich's attorney, did not im-
mediately return a call seeking comment.

ELECTION, from Page 1
Marsh, Monica Leadon Cooper
grabbed 25 percent of the vote
while Richard Selwach and Ozzy
Angulo picked up 4.3 and 1.5
percent respectively.
Selwach, the owner of Best
Jewelry & Loan Pawnbrokers, in-
sisted that although he was dis-
appointed with the loss, it would
not be his last attempt at public
office.
"I'm too young and good-
looking (to stop now)," he said
while sitting at the bar at Mark's
Prime Steakhouse. "You haven't
seen the last of Selwach."
The winner of the April 13th
run-off for mayor will replace
current mayor Pegeen Hanrahan,
who will fulfill her two-term lim-
it in May.
Lowe, who would be Gaines-
ville's first openly gay mayor,
said he has no intention of grow-
ing complacent despite his 11
percent lead.
"We'll hit the ground run-
ning again tomorrow," he said.
"There's no time to turn backto failed policies rooted in the
past."
After the results were an-
nounced, Angulo said he would
endorse Lowe in the run-off,
while Selwach pledged his sup-
port for Marsh. Cooper did not
endorse either candidate.
Although Marsh hoped to
avoid a run-off, he said he was
encouraged by the results.
"I'm an optimist," he said. "I
had the crazy idea
Local that lightning would
News strike, and it'd be
over tonight."
After the results were an-
nounced, Marsh and his support-
ers, including Alley, held a party
at the Fraternal Order of Police
Gator Lodge.
Marsh said his two biggest
concerns are raising finances and
reaching out to those who voted
for Cooper and Selwach.
"We know what we need," he
said. "And we will leave no stone
unturned in getting there."

No. 6 Gators even season series with No. 5 Seminoles
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF first baseman Preston Tucker watches his home run during the third inning of the Gators' 8-5 win
against FSU in McKethan Stadium on Tuesday. Tucker scored one run and had four RBIs.By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
FSU lived dangerously, and
Preston Tucker made the Semi-
noles regret it.
They dared Tucker to swing
Tuesday, and his four RBIs
helped No. 6 UF (13-3) beat No. 5
FSU 8-5 in front of a season-high
4,773 fans in McKethan Stadium.
Tucker pulled a fastball in
the third inning over the right-
center field fence for a solo home
run, his second-round tripper in
as many days. The sophomore
led the Gators in all three Triple
Crown categories in 2009, but
opponents have pitched around
him this season.
"He's a bit frustrated," coach
Kevin O'Sullivan said about
Tucker's lack of hittable pitches.
"The first 10, 12 games, he wasn't
getting pitched to a lot. But we
kept telling him, 'At some point,
they're going to have to pitch to
you.
The slugger followed his home
run with a shot that brought the
crowd out of its seats in the fourth
inning. With the bases loaded,Tucker missed a grand slam by
inches when he pulled a pitch to
the fence for a sacrifice fly.
The sophomore again came to
the plate with the bases loaded
in the next frame, but FSU coach
Mike Martin decided not to test
Tucker a second time. Reliever
Tyler Everett didn't throw a pitch
near the strike zone and walked
the first baseman on four pitch-
es, gift-wrapping a run to the
Gators.
The scoreboard was active
early in the game,
as the two teams
combined for 11
runs in the firstBaseball four innings.
UF second
baseman Josh Adams broke out
of a slump when he hit a two-run
homer just inside the right-field
foul pole in the first.
The home run pulled UF
within one after FSU put three on
the scoreboard in the top of the
frame.
"Those two runs gave the team
a little boost," Adams said. "Hit-
ting's contagious, so everybody

UF SOFTBALL
Florida hosts SEC foe Auburn
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
While the Southeastern Conference has been
a dominant force in football and basketball for
years, its softball teams have only started to earn
national recognition recently.
An overlooked conference has turned into one
of the sport's cornerstones, and No. 6 Florida will
continue its SEC schedule today against Auburn.
Between the Gators' inaugural season in 1997
and the 2004 campaign, the SEC had only three
seasons with more than three top-25-finishing
teams and never landed more than two teams in
the top-10.
In the five seasons since, it has notched at
least five top-25 teams or three top-10 teams four
times.
Last season might have been the conference's
strongest yet, as three of the final four teams
standing in the Women's College World Series
came from the SEC, including then-No. 1 Florida,
which fell to Washington in the finals.
Now the Gators (18-3, 2-1 SEC) are faced with
the challenge of trying to win their third-consec-utive championship in a conference stacked with
powerhouses like No. 8 Alabama, No. 9 Georgia,
No. 14 LSU and No. 17 Tennessee.
The next step in this quest will begin at 4 p.m.,
when they host the Tigers (15-7, 2-1 SEC) in a
doubleheader at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
Even though Auburn is one of the few SEC
teams not making an appearance in the top 25,
the Gators know they can't take them lightly.
"We just have to fight pitch-
by-pitch the whole game be-
cause every SEC team out there
is tough, and it's going to be
a battle," freshman Brittany
Schutte said.
As UF's opening SEC series
Schutte against Ole Miss last weekend
showed, nothing will come
easy against any conference opponent.
Despite earning a run-rule victory in the first
game, the Gators got all they could handle from
the Rebels in Game 2, falling 6-4 in extra innings.
"Just because you beat a team by 10 runs
SEE SOFTBALL, PAGE 19Tucker immune to pressure
verybody wants to be TheMan. But not everybody can
handle being The Man.
With two outs and the bases
loaded against FSU in the fifth in-
ning, UT sophomore Preston Tucker
walked to the plate, took four pitch-
es and trotted down to first base, ex-
tending Florida's lead to 7-5.
Tucker is writing the book on
how to handle being The Man.
After a stellar freshman cam-
paign in which Tucker hit .364 with
15 home runs and a school-record 85
RBIs, the first baseman is no longer
the nation's best kept hitting secret.
Teams don't want to let the pow-
er-hitting lefty beat them, which
means Tucker gets little more than
table scraps at the plate every game.
The Seminoles knew Tucker was
hungry and not to be messed with,
so they made the diplomatic deci-sion to pay
the bully half
of their lunch
money to just
go away and
leave them
Kyle Maistri alone, rather
than chal-Kyle Points lenging himkma istri@all1igator org t ih nto a fight and
risk losing
their entire meal.
The impressive part of the whole
thing is with all the pressure on
Tucker to live up to expectations
and devour everything in sight, he's
more than happy to go hungry if his
teammates benefit as a result.
Instead of hacking at pitches out
of the zone in an effort to boost his
power numbers, the sophomore is
showing immense maturity by be-

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 17, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 19
Gators face unexpected test from rival Seminoles
Match was originally set for Feb. 24
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
It's not the way UF coach Andy
Jackson wanted it to play out, but
today is a big match for the men's
tennis team.
The No. 7 Gators (12-2,4-0 South-
eastern Conference) are off to their
best start since 2005 in SEC play, but
that won't be a factor against out-of-
conference and in-state rival No. 20
FSU (10-3,3-0 Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence).
Jackson's approach is to schedule
non-conference opponents in Janu-
ary and February to have the team
focused on SEC play during March
and April. Originally, the match was
set for Feb. 24 but was rained out
and rescheduled for today at 4 p.m.The FSU match will be Jackson's
first opportunity to win his 100th
contest at home during his tenure at
UF. Florida is undefeated at home
this season, including wins over
No. 11 Illinois and No. 28 Georgia
Tech, and the Gators are 9-1 against
the Seminoles under Jackson, with a
current three-game winning streak
in the series.
The players are still excited to
face their in-state rival.
"I was debating the other day,
'Who would I rather beat: an SEC
team or Florida State?' freshman
Bob Van Overbeek said. "I couldn't
come up with an answer. SEC wins
are special, but this is Florida State."
Van Overbeek's impressive play
at the No. 4 position has been valu-
able in Florida's recent victories.At that spot, the Boca Raton native
will likely match up against another
freshman, Connor Smith.
Smith and the rest of the Semi-
noles are coming off a heartbreak-
ing 4-3 loss to No. 38
Notre Dame on Sun-
day, and they'll face a
Florida team that hasMen's changed its look and
Tennis gained confidence
since Feb. 24.
One change has been made in
doubles, where senior Daniel Cash
has become Van Overbeek's part-
ner.
"I have a lot of confidence in
Daniel because he's a senior and a
high-level doubles player," Jackson
said.
Cash and Van Overbeek are 3-3this spring after two close losses last
weekend.
Van Overbeek's other doubles
partner, freshman Billy Federhofer,
will likely return to the court soon.
"Billy is a special returner, and
he's a young player who needs to get
experience, so I need to get him in
matches," Jackson said. "It's a very
good situation for us. You could say
that it's a rotation between them that
we have going."
There does not appear to be any
rotation in the singles lineup coming
any time soon.
No. 6 junior Alexandre Lacroix
has won six-consecutive matches
at the No. 1 spot since the team re-
turned home from the ITA Team In-
door Tournament in Charlottesville,
Va. Five of those six wins have come
since the match against FSU was
postponed.Lacroix will likely face No. 22
Jean-Yves Aubone. Aubone is com-
ing off an upset victory over No. 19
Casey Watt of Notre Dame.
Sophomore Nassim Slilam will
also have a streak on the line, as he
enters today's matchwith 12-straight
wins, mostly at the No. 6 spot.
When combined with the No.
5 court, lately played by freshman
Sekou Bangoura Jr., Florida is 26-2
at the bottom two spots.
Bangoura, a native Floridian,
said before the originally scheduled
match that while the team tries to
maintain the same focus for every
opponent, it's hard not to get more
"pumped" for FSU.
After Sunday's victory over Ala-
bama, he confirmed not much has
changed.
"We're still excited," Bangoura
said.

Adams drove in another run when he
roped a single with the bases loaded in the
fourth inning. Since going 3 for 3 on open-
ing day, Feb. 19, the junior has hit just .263.
He said he has been impatient in the bat-
ter's box.
"It's baseball," he said. "You get anxious
at times."
The Seminoles entered Tuesday averag-
ing 10 runs per game and appeared to be on
track for another offensive outburst when
cleanup hitter Mike McGee belted a three-
run homer off freshman Hudson Randall in
the first.
Randall allowed two more runs in the
next frame.
But unlike the last meeting between the
two teams, when FSU chased starter An-thony DeSclafani before he could even get
one out, the Gators' pitching staff settled
down.
The Seminoles were held scoreless and
managed only one hit in the last seven in-
nings against Randall and relievers Nick
Maronde and Kevin Chapman.
Maronde, who has been inconsistent this
season, allowed no hits in
three innings while strik-
ing out three.
The performance was
much better than his
outing Sunday against- Charleston Southern,
when he gave up two runs
Chapman in 1 1/3 innings.
"When a guy doesn't do as well as you'd
hoped, I truly want to get him out there as
quickly as I possibly can to get their feet wet
again," O'Sullivan said. "If they're good,
they're good."SOFTBALL, from page 17

SEC that that's gonna happen,"
catcher Tiffany DeFelice said. "Ev-

fight."
Despite the strength of the con-
ference, UF has faired incredibly
well over the past two seasons, go-
ing a combined 53-2 en route to a
pair of SEC titles.
This, along with the fact that
Florida was the preseason pick to
win the SEC East and is now the
highest-ranked team in the confer-
ence, means every opponent will be
gunning for the Gators.
"People always come after us
hard just cause we're Florida and
we beat a lot of teams up in the
past," senior Francesca Enea said.
"They're going to come with every-
thing and you never know what's
going to happen so we have to be
our best every day.
"We can't just show up and win

Tucker's on-base percentage is a ro-
bust .493 after Tuesday's game against
FSU, up from .419 a year ago.
His slugging percentage is a "pal-
try" .550 compared to last year's .628,
but saving outs is more important
than hitting for an extra base or two,
not that I expect Tucker to be kept un-
der .600 for much longer.
The arrival of freshman Austin
Maddox has given the Gators another
run-producing slugger in the middle
of the lineup, which allows Tucker to
take what opponents give him.
Maddox leads the team in homers
and RBIs, thanks in part to Tucker.

However, the SEC is quickly
gaining ground, and UF has shown
its mettle by going 3-2 against the
Pac-10 in games played on the West
Coast over the last three years.
"It definitely motivates us and
gives us credibility because the SEC
hasn't been known like the Pac-10
has been known in softball," junior
Kelsey Bruder said.
"But we're coming up with
teams like Georgia and Alabama
and when they come out and do
things against the West Coast, it re-
ally gives us a great name. "

The only time he left the plate with-
out an RBI in his 2-for-3 performance
was a blistering line drive to center

inning was a foot away from being a

James Ramsey caught it at the wall.
The inning prior, Tucker showed
the packed crowd that he can still
do more than trot down to first base
when he blasted a solo home run over
the right-center field wall. He can trot
around all four bases if necessary.
On pg. 21 of Tucker's book on how

Gators seek friendly confines to quell losing streak
0 SLOPPY PLAY COST UF ITS
LAST TWO CONTESTS.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
There is no place like being home
on familiar territory after a disap-
pointing loss on the road for ath-
letes, and the Florida lacrosse team
will benefit from that Wednesday.
UF (3-3, 0-1 American Lacrosse
Conference) will host the Marist
Red Foxes (2-2) in the first match of
its three-game homestand and will
look to rebound from a two-game
losing streak.
However, playing in Gainesville
won't guarantee a turnaround for
the Gators, as their recent troubles
run deeper than location.
The team's poor defense and in-
consistent offense worry head coach
Amanda O'Leary heading into the
matchup against the Red Foxes.
In its last two games, a 13-11
loss at home to Georgetown and a
16-8 defeat at Johns Hopkins, UF
has been plagued by its inability to
maintain a high level of play, espe-
cially in the second half.
Florida allowed 29 goals and had
43 turnovers in those two games.
"Our team defense is still weak,"
O'Leary said. "I don't think we've
jelled as a team, defensively. We
have, right now, seven individu-
als that are playing defense versus
seven players that are playing as a
team."O'Leary is concerned by the
team's poor help defense when a de-
fender is beaten by an opponent.And she said UF will need to "fin- -and more immediately -Marist.

UF midfielder Caroline Chesterman is the Gators' third-leading goal-scorer with 11. She has been one of
the consistent performers in an ever-changing lineup as Florida searches for the best combination.ue to plateau versus getting better,"
O'Leary said.
To improve, O'Leary and her
coaching staff have changed the
starting lineup each game to find the
best on-field pairings for UF.
Freshman midfielder Caroline
Chesterman hasn't had to worry
about the shuffling, as she has been a
staple in the lineup since the second
game of the season. She has scored
11 of the team's 77 goals so far.
She said the team knows it can
compete against talented teams, as it
did against Georgetown, but the key
is to maintain that confidence when
it takes on Marist.
"We do have the skill and the
athleticism to win," Chesterman
said. "We just have to play to our
abilities."
Fellow freshman midfielder Brit-
tany Dashiell has started every game
this season, and she has 12 of UF's
scores. Freshman attacker Ashley
Bruns leads the team with 14 goals
and 14 assists on the season, and she
too has started every game.
So when the Gators play at 6:30
p.m. against the Red Foxes, some of
the usual starters will be on the field,
but O'Leary will have to pick the
best 12-player group for the defen-
sive and offensive cohesiveness that
has eluded the Gators so far.
"Hopefully, we'll be able to find
people that click on the attack and
dick in the midfield and click on the
defensive end, and then we'll be in
good shape," O'Leary said. "We're
working to get to that right now."
