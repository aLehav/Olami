Tuesday’s mid-year elections saw a modest turn-
out in Alachua County, said supervisor of elections 
Pam Carpenter.
More than 30,000 primary votes were cast, put-
ting county voter turnout at about 19.5 percent.
Carpenter said the average turnout for midterm 
elections can range anywhere from 20 to 35 percent. 
She was hoping turnout would be higher because 
Alachua County saw record-breaking turnout dur-ing early voting, but numbers seemed standard Tuesday evening.
“It’s pretty much in line with what we’ve seen be-
fore in past mid-year primaries,” Carpenter said. 
Ted Yoho won the Republican primary for Flor-
ida’s 3rd Congressional District, beating out candi-date Jake Rush. Yoho received 80 percent of about 
9,800 votes cast in Alachua County. 
In comparison, Glo Smith received 63 percent 
of about 640 votes cast in the county. About 10,800 
votes were cast for Smith within her district, win-ning the Republican primary for Florida’s 5th Con-
gressional District.
Other primary winners included Republican in-
cumbent Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie 
Crist, who won the Democratic primary.
At about 6:40 a.m., Lavon Bracy of Gainesville ar-
rived at her polling station.

The UF Computing Help Desk will 
now listen to your late night technologi-
cal woes when Murphy’s Law strikes. 
After providing 24-hour, 7-day-a-
week technological support for UF On-
line students since May, the UF Comput-
ing Help Desk has extended its service hours to all students, faculty and staff.
Tracy Gale, UF Information Tech-
nology communications manager, said there are now staff members in Hub 132 answering the phone and responding to emails after the building closes. 
“This is a great resource when you are 
working late and ﬁ  nishing assignments,” Gale wrote in an email. “We hope these extra service hours will be helpful for our students, knowing that if an IT issue happens at night you have someplace to call or email for assistance.”
Some students see the beneﬁ  ts when 
it comes to working at late hours. 
“That’s a beneﬁ  cial resource,” Mat-
thew Hayes, a UF mechanical engineer-ing senior, said. “But it won’t change how often I use it. I don’t often run into those issues at night.” 
Even during the day, issues with e-
Learning, GatorLink and VPN and Wi-Fi connectivity can now be solved by calling or emailing the Help Desk.
UF linguistics exchange student Gera 
Kruithof trekked from her off-campus apartment to the Help Desk to look for help with her UF email address. 
“It’s quite far here,” she said. “It’s 
great if (students) know about (the new hours).”Hub help desk open 24/7

A repeat UF trespasser and thief was ar-
rested Tuesday morning at Marston Science 
Library following an undercover operation, according to the University Police.
At about 10:30 a.m., UPD found and iden-
tiﬁ  ed James McCray, 34, of Gainesville, in Marston.
UPD spokesman Brad Barber said McCray 
has a long history of theft and was on an ac-tive trespass list compiled by UPD at the time of his arrest.
After Detective Jeff Moran approached 
McCray, he said McCray ran and hid in the library. 
A UPD press release stated that while Mo-
ran and other uniformed ofﬁ  cers searched for McCray, they received a phone call from a student who said his backpack was stolen in the building.
A thorough search of the library was con-
ducted, resulting in the discovery of McCray in a bathroom stall on a lower ﬂ  oor by Inves-
tigator Ernest Hale, accord-
ing to the release. 
Hale ordered McCray 
out of the stall, who was still in possession of the stolen backpack.
McCray was arrested 
and charged with trespass-ing after warning and felo-
ny theft. 
Barber encouraged students to report 
crime or suspicious behavior as soon as pos-
sible.
“Students need to come to us when this 
stuff happens,” he said. “That’s how we were 
able to ﬁ  nd McCray.”UF trespasser with theft history

After the fatal shooting of Michael Brown 
this month, campus and community leaders 
are shedding light on and raising awareness 
about the events that followed in Ferguson, 
Missouri.  
Journa Cobite, president of the NAACP’s 
UF chapter, said she hopes campus minority 
groups will continue to collaborate.
“I want us to join together to make a broad-
er impact on the community,” said Cobite, a 
21-year-old sociology senior. 
Cobite said the campus’ NAACP chapter 
hosted a forum last week where locals were invited to voice their opinions and speak out on how they would address similar situations in the community. 
The group later posed for a “hands up, 
don’t shoot” photo to honor Brown, the 18-year-old who was killed after being shot at least six times by 28-year-old Ferguson police Ofﬁ  cer Darren Wilson. 
Following his death, Brown’s body re-
mained on the street for four hours. Two days later, the FBI opened a civil rights investiga-tion regarding the fatal shooting.
Ferguson Police did not identify Wilson as Brown’s shooter for nearly a week, fueling ral-lies and riots in the St. Louis suburb.
Supporters of the campus NAACP event in-
cluded UF’s Black Student Union and the cam-pus chapter of Dream Defenders, a national human rights organization. 
Shrisa Reid-Renaud, BSU president and 
21-year-old telecommunication senior, said the organization will continue to inform stu-dents and the public about their rights.
“As a black leader on this campus, my ap-
proach is to be proactive,” she said, noting 
the organization will continue working with 
NAACP and other campus minority groups. 
As of now, a series of meetings are being 
held between NAACP and minority organi-
zations to ﬁ  gure out their next move. Reid-
Renaud said they wish to avoid unorganized rallies and want to move forward together. 
“We want to remain uniﬁ  ed at this time, not 
separated,” Cobite said.
Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben 
Tobias said the department cannot comment on the events in Ferguson but said GPD regu-larly patrols protests and understands every-
one has the right to speak their minds. He said 
there was a rally outside of the GPD building last week concerning Brown. 
“We are here to ensure the safety of any-
one who chooses to speak their mind,” he said. 
“We also have a deep-rooted relationship with 
our community, and we are not going to break that trust because we worked very hard for it, and it is difﬁ  cult to get back.” Campus organizations react to Ferguson police shootings

Student senators were quick to kick 
off the new school year with resolutions 
geared toward Fall elections at the ﬁ  rst 
UF Student Senate meeting of the semes-
ter on Tuesday night.
Without any naysayers, two reap-
portionment bills for the Fall and Spring elections were approved. Changes in 
student population in on-campus and 
off-campus housing, as well as college enrollment, dictate the number of stu-dent senators allotted to a district, col-
lege or classiﬁ  cation. 
Judiciary Chairman Bronco Vuskovich 
and Sen. Jason Richards introduced the 
bills along with Senate President Pro-
Tempore Joseph Michaels.
“I think both bills are the most accu-
rate description of where the seats should 
be,” Michaels said after the meeting.
This Fall, District A, which includes 
ZIP codes 32601, 32609 and 32614, gained one more senate seat for a total of 10 seats. District C, which only serves ZIP code 32607, lost one seat, dropping 
to six seats.
District B’s seven senate seats in ZIP 
codes 32603, 32605, 32606 and 32653 
were unaffected, as well as District D’s 13 senators in ZIP code 32608. District 
E, which represents areas outside of the 
listed ZIP codes surrounding campus, retained its sole senate seat.
For Spring elections, Warrington Col-
lege of Business Administration gained one seat, for a total of three senators. The sophomore class lost one seat, with six 
remaining seats left.
Supervisor of Elections Hans Rojas also presented a contingency plan for the upcoming elections. He said he worked 
to avoid any technical glitches that might affect voting.
The campaign season begins Tues-
day. Elections will be held on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 2014

� 1,500 PANTHER AND 2,200 
BLACK BEAR SIGHTINGS HAVE BEEN REPORTED
PATRICK PINAK
Alligator Contributing Writer
As cities continue to expand, Florida 
panther and bear sighting photos are help-
ing state biologists better understand these predators’ changing habitats, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commis-
sion reported this week. 
Two years ago, the agency started ask-
ing the public to submit panther sighting 
locations and photos, said Darrell Land, FWC panther team leader.  And as of last year, it began asking for bear sighting in-formation, too.
“With the explosion of cameras and trail 
cameras, there are a lot of opportunities for 
the public to help panther work simply by 
sharing their pictures,” Land said.
For instance, Land said ﬁ  nding a female 
panther north of the Caloosahatchee River would be signiﬁ  cant because it could mean the endangered population is increasing.
There are only 100 to 180 panthers in 
Florida with most sightings in the south.
About 1,500 panther sightings were re-
ported as of June, and 275 of those sight-ings included photos. Land said some people have mistaken house cats for pan-thers, so photos make the sightings more credible. 
There have also been about 2,200 Black 
bear sightings and almost a quarter of those reports contained photos. 
These predators are harder to track in 
rural areas, said Brian Scheick, FWC bear research biologist, which is why the agen-cy reaches out to outdoor enthusiasts. 
“It will be useful to know if bears are 
becoming more common in rural areas,” Scheick said. “We might have to do things like put in bear-proof garbage cans.”Sighted:

19.5 percent turnout with 30,000 ballots cast
made the trip to the polls.  
Bracy said she even sat 
outside through lunch, en-
couraging others to exercise 
their civic duty. 
“I haven’t missed voting 
since I was 21 years old and 
now I’m 65,” she said, add-
ing that she raised her two children to be active voters as well. 
Bracy said turnout seemed 
mild at her Precinct 27 sta-
tion, slowing down through-
out the day. 
Karen Fisher, a teacher for 
the Alachua County School District, pulled up to the same 
polling station at about 6 p.m. 
to vote.
By then, the center was 
nearly empty, but Fisher cast 
a ballot anyway.
“Using your right to vote is vitally important,” she said. 
Carpenter said Tuesday’s 
election went smoothly.
Though a few machines 
were not operating correctly 
early in the day, she said the machines were replaced.“All of the votes have been 
tabulated,” she said.
Precinct 6 caused a short 
delay in reporting ﬁ  nal num-bers because of a phone line error.
Poll workers were not able 
to send the votes in remotely 
and instead had to physically 
drive the ballot results back.
Final numbers came in a 
little after 9 p.m.ELECTIONS ,

A UF biotechnology startup 
has launched a $1 million cam-
paign to create a painless solu-tion for insulin injections. 
Prometheon Pharma has 
launched an Indiegogo cam-paign to begin the research and development of a biodegrad-able, needle-free insulin patch to improve the lives of millions living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.
The biotech startup was 
formed in 2011 by former UF 
faculty member Stephen Hsu. 
The patches will be almost 
transparent and vary in size 
depending on the insulin dose, said Hsu, the chief executive of-ﬁ  cer and founder of Promethe-on.
“Depending on how much 
a patient needs, the patch can 
be as big as 5 centimeters or as 
small as a 1-centimeter dot,”  Hsu said. 
The majority of insulin from 
injections doesn’t get absorbed, Hsu said.  With the patch, the insulin can dissolve through a very thin layer of the skin, mak-ing it painless and safer for pa-
tients, he said.
“I think that ultimately, 
everything that we produced 
is aimed at advancing health care,” Hsu said. 
Abigail Devonmille, a 
19-year-old UF advertising sophomore, has been living with Type 1 diabetes for more 
than 10 years.“I have scarring on my skin 
from injecting myself,” Devon-
mille said. 
She said she currently uses 
an insulin pump, but she has 
had problems in the past with 
injections as she would some-times hit an artery. 
“This pump is always at-
tached to me, and if I can have something like a patch, that would be so convenient,” De-vonmille said.
The patches will also cost 
about 25 percent less than nee-dles, Hsu said. 
“We want to make it equal 
access to everyone,” he said.  
Hsu doesn’t plan on stop-
ping with insulin patches. He wants to work on developing other drugs with the patch plat-form technology.
“It’s not just a patch for in-
sulin, but we’re going to test for vaccines, antidepressants, antibiotics and all other kinds of things,” he said.
Prometheon hopes the Indi-
egogo campaign will support its patch research and move it one step closer to being ap-
proved by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The Indiegogo campaign runs until Sept. 8. So far, the campaign has raised more than $10,000.  
Devon Grimmé, the director 
of business development at Pro-metheon, said, “Since insulin is already approved by the FDA, 
it won’t take as long to get ap-
proved and that $1 million will get us one step toward human trials and on the market.”
“If all goes well, and we get 
that money, we should be on the market by 2018,” he said.UF biotech startup

A student organization is re-
minding students to look after more 
than just their physical health.
Awareness Wellness Ambassa-
dors Reaching Everyone (AWARE), 
a peer-to-peer ambassador program 
for UF’s Counseling and Wellness Center, seeks to promote mental health and reduce the stigma of seeking help, said Collin Vernay, AWARE coordinator and involve-ment undergraduate intern. 
The program continually strives 
to reach more students and target 
populations, especially groups that 
are at risk for mental health issues, he said. 
This year, AWARE will imple-
ment more original events aimed at empowering people to live healthier mental lifestyles. 
“One of the problems we face is 
there is a high demand for the Well-ness Center, but there are only so many resources,” Vernay, a 21-year-old UF psychology and sociology se-
nior, said. “We want to lead people 
in living mindfully and building up the protective factors that reduce the likelihood of mental health issues developing in the ﬁ  rst place.” 
The lack of understanding about 
mental health creates a bad name around it, said Madeline Bieda, a 20-year-old UF psychology junior.
“If people viewed mental disor-
ders for what they really are, which are diseases as real as anything from cancer to the common cold, they wouldn’t stigmatize people who have them so much,” she said. 
Co-founder of AWARE and 
UF alumna Shari Godwin, 22, said bringing the conversation about mental health issues to a relatable 
level is key to reducing the stigma.
The center provides services and 
hotlines for students with personal 
mental health concerns, as well as those with concerns for their friends, she said.
AWARE is recruiting members 
through Sept. 9, and applications are live on its web page at counsel-
ing.uﬂ  .edu/cwc/aware.aspx.  “If we can put a face and 
shed some light on it, we 
can show it happens and 
that it’s not unusual.”

I have been in the Florida school system all my life. 
Although my public education worked to my ad-
vantage, that is not always the case for minority stu-
dents like myself. A major problem in the American edu-
cation system today is the school-to-prison pipeline.  
The school-to-prison pipeline involves deep, integrated 
cooperation between state government agencies, law en-forcement and the private prison industry. 
The state helps funnel many children into the path 
of the prison system by adopting harsh zero tolerance 
policies.
That allows police to arrest students on school cam-
puses for minor infractions such as fist fights and dress code violations. 
To make a profit, private prison companies set quotas 
on the amount of prisoners needed to fill prison cells.
That creates an incentive to incarcerate as many of-
fenders as possible. 
As a result, law enforcement target poorer minority 
communities at a higher rate than usual. 
This practice is irresponsible and morally wrong. 
To put the school-to-prison pipeline into perspective, 
about 12,000 Florida students were arrested a nearly 
14,000 times in 2013. Arresting young people of color at this rate has potentially irreversible effects and is a display of blatant discrimination. 
Being arrested at a young age can shatter a child’s 
trust of authority. 
And he or she may come to see school as a hostile, 
unwelcoming place. 
Repeated infractions can lead to serious felony of-
fenses, which set these children up for failure. 
Our country’s current method of correcting behavior 
prefers trimming weeds, rather than pulling them out by the roots. 
A more productive method would be to shift away 
from the punitive approach by mentoring students, maximizing the use of guid-ance counselors and including parents in the correction pro-
cess. This tactic actually worked 
in Miami-Dade and Broward 
Counties. 
In 2013, school districts and the NAACP partnered 
together and succeeded in cutting in-school arrests in 
half. 
Despite these improvements, the state of Florida still 
leads the country in school-based arrests. 
Although new methods have been more effective in 
reducing the number of student arrests and incarcera-
tions, they still do not address the true root of the issue: 
poverty. 
Poor communities need the resources that affluent 
communities take for granted, such as full funding for public schools. 
Millions of dollars of desperately needed education 
funding have been gutted by the Florida Legislature un-der Gov. Rick Scott’s authority. Creating and enabling the privatization of prisons is not a viable solution. 
It will not curb the spread of poverty or the expan-
sion of the school-to-prison pipeline.
Every American child, regardless of race or socio-
economic status, deserves access to a quality public education. 
The prison-industrial complex emphasizes profits 
more than empowering our underprivileged youth. 
Making money off of the imprisonment of black and 
brown boys is disgraceful and irresponsible. Dealing 
with mass incarcerations remain unfinished business in 
our state and our country. Divest from private prisons. Invest in our future.

primaries?Today’s question: Have you ever used the UF IT Help 
Desk in the Hub?Koch influence 
on FSU sets risky 
precedent
Despite never having held any elected office, Charles and 
David Koch are two of the best-known, most influential political figures in the U.S. The brothers, who own and 
operate the megacorporation Koch Industries, have spent vast amounts of money on political advertising and campaign dona-
tions in recent years. 
The Koch brothers promote a deeply conservative, anti-
government approach to public policy — one that aligns closely 
with their business interests. 
The political activities of the Koch brothers have been well 
documented by the media. However, one of their endeavors, which could have a significant impact on a major Florida uni-versity, has been largely ignored.
Over the past several years, the Koch brothers and their af-
filiated groups have donated millions of dollars to a number of American colleges and universities.
Among these donations was a $1.5 million contribution to 
the Florida State University Department of Economics given by Charles Koch in 2008. The donation included a stipulation that allowed Koch to select members of an advisory committee with veto power over new faculty hires.
News of this arrangement between Koch and the university 
first surfaced in 2011. However, the Kochs’ relationship with 
FSU has come under scrutiny during the university’s search for 
a new president.
Many members of FSU’s presidential search committee have 
ties to the Koch brothers and to the American Legislative Ex-change Council (ALEC), a conservative policy organization heavily supported by the Kochs. 
The leading candidate for the FSU presidency, Sen. John 
Thrasher, R-Fla., is currently the chairman of Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign. Scott has received immense support from 
the Koch brothers for his hard-line conservative and pro-corpo-
rate stances. Like the Kochs, Thrasher is known as a strong op-ponent of unions, particularly in the public sector. 
FSU students, alumni and faculty have protested Thrasher’s 
front-runner status as part of a broader complaint about the lack of student representation in academic decisions. 
These attempts by the Koch brothers and their allies to con-
trol the academic environment at FSU should be troubling to all college students in Florida and around the country.
The purpose of the university system is to enable students to 
receive the best possible education to prepare them for their ca-reers. Academic freedom in America’s colleges and universities should not be sold to the highest bidder. 
If the Koch brothers are able to run roughshod over the inter-
ests and values of the FSU student community, it seems likely that they and other wealthy, politically inclined Americans will replicate this strategy at other universities.
University administrators and faculty members should be 
evaluated based on their qualifications and not on whether their political beliefs align with those of wealthy donors. WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 27, 2014

Starting college can be an excit-
ing yet daunting experience. It’s not surprising that with all the 
stress that comes with it, some new students gain the dreaded Freshman 
15. A study published in Nutrition 
Journal found that nearly a quarter of freshmen gain at least 5 percent of their body weight during their ﬁ  rst semester, an average of about 10 pounds in just a few months.   
In an effort to help students 
look and feel great, the movement toward of-fering more plant-based meals is taking root 
on college campuses nationwide. In fact, there are about 200 universities leading the change with Meatless Mondays in their dining halls. 
Why take a weekly holiday from 
meat? In recent decades, our meat consumption has increased dramat-ically — along with our waistlines, blood pressure and cholesterol. 
Eating healthier plant-based 
meals not only helps our physical health, but it also lightens our car-bon footprint.
According to the Food and Agri-
culture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture is “one of the top two or three most signiﬁ  -cant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.” 
Factory farms — where nearly all of our meat comes from  —  are major culprits in climate change. These animal factories create huge amounts of manure that pollute the soil, water and air. 
Thankfully, it’s never been eas-
ier to take a positive step toward safeguarding our health while also protecting the planet and helping animals. Choosing simple, delicious options once a week can make a big difference. How about swapping those chicken nuggets with meat-free nuggets, or choosing veggie and bean burritos instead of carni-tas burritos? Eating out is easy, too. With options like Chipotle Mexican Grill and Denny’s serving up hearty 
meat-free fare and with Indian, Thai 
and Mexican restaurants that regu-larly offer delicious, plant-based dishes, the options are endless.
Bon appétit! Eddie Garza is a food policy coor-
dinator for The Humane Society of the United States.

Being a transfer student can be hard — but it will be OK
On my ﬁ  rst day of classes as a UF 
transfer student, I wasn’t lost. I knew exactly where I was.
When I attended the transfer Preview in 
April 2013, I anxiously waited for it to end so that I could pick my classes.
I thought because I had moved from Mi-
ami to attend Santa Fe College, and I already knew the UF campus like the back of my hand, I had nothing to worry about. In some ways, this was true. But I wasn’t as ready as I thought.
I was a little ﬁ  sh 
(or Gator) in a sea of people who had already been here for a while, and it was going to be lonely at times.After a year here, I can say: It gets better.This school can be intimidating at ﬁ  rst, 
but remember you’re a Gator too.
Whether it’s Greek life, the Gator March-
ing Band or even a publication, there’s some-thing waiting to make you feel at home.
The only way you won’t transition into 
your new home is if you don’t try. 
Most importantly, just because you made it to UF doesn’t mean it’s time for school-work to take a back seat. Put as much effort as you did trying to get into UF into your classes.
Make the most of your time in the Gator 
Nation. It’s your home for the next two (or more) years.

Alligator Staff Writer aharris@alligator.org
Pedro Bravo is a murderer.
So said the jury, who found him guilty of the 
murder of his friend, Christian Aguilar.
“That is not a label I gave him,” Christian’s fa-
ther, Carlos Aguilar, told the media after the ver-dict. “It is a label he gave himself.”
But Bravo gave himself other labels, as re-
vealed in a series of letters and drawings he sent to the Alligator.
Alligator Staff Writer Chris Alcantara, who 
has since graduated, began corresponding with 
Bravo while he was in the Alachua County Jail.
The letters are written in the same style seen in 
Bravo’s journal, which was ﬁ  lled with song lyrics, 
moody quotes and brooding about his girlfriend, 
Erika Friman, and his future.
His favorite sad song, he said, is “Sparks” by 
Coldplay.
The writing is small, neat and precise. In care-
ful, delicate lines, Bravo revealed that he grew up 
in Hialeah before moving to Sweetwater to attend 
Doral Academy, where he 
ﬁ  rst met Erika and Chris-
tian.
“I remember growing 
up as a child we never had much of anything, but my parents did everything they could to make it 
a happy childhood,” he wrote.
Bravo had a group of friends he was close with, 
including Erika, Christian and several friends he 
hung out with often in Gainesville.
“I am different with a strange but pleasing 
sense of humor, friendly though rather shy, but 
once I am out of my shell since I think I have got-
ten to know you better I 
can be a real good friend,” 
he wrote.
Bravo liked to volun-
teer, especially at animal shelters. He told the jury 
the Alachua shelter was 
one of the ﬁ  rst places he 
visited in Gainesville.
He was an honors 
student. While attending 
Doral, he’d worked on 
his dual degree at Miami Dade College. He had 
a scholarship to Florida 
International University 
to study biomedical engi-
neering.
But he wasn’t happy there.
In his turn on the 
stand, Bravo told the jury he and his friends 
would dismiss FIU. As 
honors students, they 
joked that if they failed 
in college, “at least I can 
get into FIU.”
Bravo applied to no 
other college, but as-
sured the jury that he had the grades and extra-
curriculars to get into UF.
Right around high school graduation, the ten-
sions between Bravo and Erika, who had been 
dating more than two years, became unbearable.
She was unhappy, he said. She’d tried to end 
the relationship in December, but Bravo begged her to give it another shot. In June, however, she 
put her foot down. 
“Things had escalated in our relationship. I 
didn’t feel the same as when we began dating. It was complicated,” she told the jury.
Bravo was deeply upset by the breakup. 
Erika was moving on, moving up to Gainesville 
to attend Santa Fe, while he was still in Miami, at 
FIU. She didn’t want to do long distance.
At FIU orientation, he said the feeling of being 
someplace he shouldn’t was overwhelming, so he 
decided to move to Gainesville in hopes of a fresh 
start and rekindling things with Erika.
“I moved up to Gainesville for college (sic) but 
one of the reasons was also to ease or speed up the change from being dependent to independent,” he wrote.
He arrived in late August, 
moving into Spyglass Apartment 
Y177 with random roommates.
He began to ﬁ  nd his footing 
in Gainesville.  He signed up for 
classes: art and chemistry. He 
caught up with old friends and 
began running every other day 
“to blow off steam.”
He liked playing video 
games, describing himself as a “PC gamer at heart.” He was ac-
tive on his Steam account, a mas-
sive online video game store, 
particularly the game “Atom 
Zombie Smasher.”
But the two hobbies he held 
most dear were the two most dissected on the stand.
“He did do grafﬁ  ti. He was 
very artistic — is very artistic,” 
Erika told the jury.
Bravo told the jury he was 
interested in everything from 
painting on the 34th Street Wall to notebook sketches for friends. His journal is ﬁ  lled with 
doodles, both elaborate and casual.
“Art is like oxygen for me, (sic) what else can 
cool the mind and tame the heart than the cun-
ning mastery of a brush or pencil,” he wrote.
In jail, his artistic options were more limited. 
He drew with a black safety pen and watercol-
ored with the dye on peanut M&Ms.
“Ever held a pack of M&M’s and have the col-
or transfer to your palms. Eureka,” he wrote.
Bravo told the jury the shovel he bought, which 
the state proved was used to bury Christian, was for his new hobby of moss grafﬁ  ti.
He collected soil and lichen samples, blended 
them with buttermilk and thickeners, and then 
sprayed them onto walls. With regular misting, 
the shapes would grow into natural art.
When he was younger, Bravo dabbled in play-
ing violin. He’s also a self-proclaimed history 
nerd. He told the jury his Internet searches for “types of unsolved murders” were prompted by 
a particularly scintillating History channel show.
Musically, he likes sounds from the 1950s, in-
die rock, classical and hip-hop.
He especially likes listening to music while he 
goes on “aimless drives” in an effort to lose him-
self on the road. All friends who testiﬁ  ed agreed 
that Bravo loved to drive.
Much of his testimony about the night of 
Christian’s murder centered on Bravo’s afﬁ  nity 
to drive without a destination in mind.
The driving calmed him, Bravo said. Especial-
ly during the ﬁ  rst few weeks in Gainesville, when the suicidal thoughts he’d been battling for the 
past four years became stronger.
This was compounded by Bravo’s relationship with his parents. They weren’t happy with him 
leaving FIU, or with how he spent money, or with how he wrecked his car a few weeks prior.
His father said their relationship had gone 
“from bad to worse.”
Bravo tried to tell other friends about it, but 
he said they didn’t understand. His close friend 
Rosa Felibert “looked at me like she wanted to rip 
my head off.”
He had his friends take all the knives from his 
house, just in case. On the stand, other friends said Bravo “played the suicide card” often. 
Bravo wanted to speak with a friend who 
could relate, he told the jury. So he arranged to 
meet Christian at the UF Hub and discuss his sui-cidal thoughts.
In his journal, he wrote at length about those 
feelings.
“I got my heart broken, I went through a per-
sonal hell only the conﬁ  nes of this book knows,” 
he wrote.
These feelings came to a head on Sept. 20, 2012 
— the night of Christian’s murder.
Bravo denies murdering his friend. He said he 
left Christian beaten but alive, and he said was off attempting suicide after.
His last entry in his journal, from that night, 
was a suicide note:
 “Im sorry. There is no right way to explain 
why Im doing this;
Im selﬁ  sh, inconsiderate, and hopeless.I dont want to be forgiven; I dont deserve it.
I just want to stop hurting and I want to be 
happy.Maybe I was wrong, maybe this was the big-
gest mistake ever
But for far too long I have felt this way. Now 
it ends
This would be easier with you who miss me to 
be mad at me
To remember all my faults, to be angry at me
So your anger may take hold over your sad-
ness
I am ﬂ  awed but now those ﬂ  aws come to an 
end
Hopefully I will be happy.- Pedro A. Bravo”

UF Soccer moves up in poll
The UF soccer team moved up two spots to No. 6 in 
the NSCAA poll, released on Tuesday. The Gators shut out their ﬁ  rst two opponents of the 2014 season. Mr. Two Bits Reveal
Former UF defensive back Lito Sheppard will be the ﬁ  rst honorary Mr. Two Bits for the 2014 football season against Idaho on Saturday. Sheppard was a ﬁ  rst-team All-America selection in the 2000 season. Mike Taylor will be one of Florida’s leaders on defense this season. Read the story on Page 16.JORDAN MCPHERSON

Treon Harris won the ﬁ  rst bat-
tle.
Coach Will Muschamp an-
nounced on Tuesday that the true 
freshman edged out fellow fresh-
man Will Grier and redshirt soph-
omore Skyler Mornhinweg for the backup quarterback position be-hind starter Jeff Driskel.
But his spot as the No. 2 quar-
terback is not set in stone.
“Treon has some things he can 
provide for us offensively, but that’s nothing that’s made for the 
long term,” Muschamp said. “No 
one’s been redshirted. No deci-sions have been made with Will Grier, Skyler Mornhinweg or anyone else. All of those guys did some good things and we’re gonna move forward from week-to-week on that situation there.”
Added Driskel: “I think there is 
a lot of talent behind me at quar-terback. I think Treon gives us a little bit more as far as short yard-age packages or coming in wildcat kind of deals. They’re going to keep competing, they’re going to keep battling. I told all of the guys this isn’t a permanent thing.”
If the situation presents itself, 
Muschamp still plans on insert-ing Harris into Saturday’s season opener against Idaho.
“I think a lot of that will be de-
termined game day and the situ-ation of the game and those sort of things,” Muschamp said, “but we’d like to.” Back in 2011, Driskel, then the 
backup to starting quarterback John Brantley, played two drives in Florida’s season opener against Florida Atlantic. 
His ﬁ  rst pass attempt was an 
interception.
Heading into Saturday’s match-
up against the Vandals, the Ovie-do, Fla., native and now-starter hopes the same doesn’t happen for Harris.
“You’re not always going to 
make the right read or make the 
perfect throw, but it’s a long season 
and a long game,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to put that in the past and move on. Coach’s mindset this year is play to the next play and that’s what you’re going to have to do. But I hope the younger quar-terbacks don’t throw picks on their ﬁ  rst play.”
Secondary starters announced: 
Muschamp announced that junior Brian Poole will start at the cor-nerback position opposite Vernon Hargreaves III, and senior Jabari Gorman received the nod to start at safety along with Keanu Neal.
With the exception of Neal, who 
Muschamp said is the team’s top 
safety, each member of the start-
ing secondary started at least ﬁ  ve games in 2013.
Hargreaves, a member of the 
preseason All-Southeastern Con-ference ﬁ  rst team, led Florida with 11 pass breakups and three inter-ceptions in 2013.
Gorman led the group with 
48 tackles last season — good for sixth on the team and fourth among players still on UF’s roster — while also recording an inter-ception, a forced fumble and seven pass breakups.
Poole, who started six games at 
the nickel cornerback position, tal-
lied 32 tackles, two interceptions 
and three pass breakups in his sophomore year after recording just three tackles in 2012.
And even though true fresh-
men Jalen Tabor, J.C. Jackson and Quincy Williams are not starting, Muschamp said all three will re-ceive playing time on Saturday.
“Those guys will play on spe-
cial teams during the game,” Mus-champ said, “and depending on how they progress in practice dur-ing the week will determine how 
much corner they play.”
True freshman Duke Dawson 
and redshirt freshmen Nick Wash-
ington and Marcell Harris will also have the opportunity to play at safety.
Other position battles: The 
starter at running back is still up for grabs between sophomore Kelvin Taylor, junior Matt Jones and redshirt senior Mack Brown. Freshman Brandon Powell also has the chance to see the ﬁ  eld because of his ability to catch the ball out of 
the backﬁ  eld, Muschamp said.
Clay Burton holds the starting 
tight end position over redshirt se-
nior transfer Jake McGee, but Mus-champ has praised both on their progression throughout camp.
Junior Latroy Pittman is pro-
jected as the starting slot receiver.

We all know Will Muschamp hasn’t yet attained the suc-
cess that Urban Meyer did in his tenure at the University of 
Florida.
But there is one thing Muschamp has done better than his 
coaching predecessor: instill discipline in his players.
I’m not saying each and every player under Meyer failed 
to follow the straight and narrow, but it doesn’t take that 
much digging to ﬁ  nd the dirt the former UF coach had to 
continually sweep under the rug.
During Urban Meyer’s six seasons at the helm, 31 players 
were arrested. Now for those of you who have been keep-ing count of Gators arrested under Muschamp like I have, 
you might be saying, ‘But isn’t Muschamp on the same pace 
as Meyer since he has had 15 players arrested/cited in just three seasons?’That’s a fair observation. But let 
me counter.
Janoris Jenkins, Chris Martin 
and Kedric Johnson were all ar-rested during Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst month as head coach. Meyer — not Muschamp — recruited all three players.
Leon Orr, A.C. Leonard and 
Trip Thurman were also arrested 
while Muschamp has held the head coach position, but all three also committed to UF when Meyer was still recruiting 
for the Gators.
After Muschamp cut Jenkins and urged others like 
De’Ante Saunders and Dee Finley to transfer, it not only 
became clear to me that Muschamp valued discipline more than Meyer, but it also became clear to the players.
After Jenkins was dismissed, the cornerback said, “If (Meyer) was still the coach at Florida, I’d still be there.”
Former UF safety Bryan Thomas said Meyer’s team was 
“out of control.”
Fast forward to 2014.Freshman Jalen Tabor became the ﬁ  rst UF player in nearly 
a year to run into legal trouble after being cited for marijuana possession of less than 20 grams. And this came back in May when Tabor wasn’t even attending classes at Florida.
During the Gators’ media day on Aug. 3, Muschamp ad-

stay within the lines of what we 
need to do and how they’re going to act and represent the University 
of Florida.”
I know Muschamp hasn’t pro-
duced the same type of winning 
culture that Meyer did in his ﬁ  ve 
years in Gainesville, but you have 
to respect how Muschamp is put-
ting the standards and values of 
the university in front of winning 
games.
Could you say the same about 
Meyer?
No.
The discussion always returns 
to the old cliché, “Winning isn’t 
everything.” Of course fans want to see more wins, more champion-
ship trophies and more First-Team 
All-Americans.
But at what cost? These ath-
letes aren’t just athletes. They’re students. They’re members of our 
community. They’re people that 
should be held to the same stan-dards that you and I are held to.
I know football is king — es-
pecially in the south — but it’s ri-diculous to stick up for a man like Meyer who places a sport above basic human values. Now listen to Muschamp’s ﬁ  nal comment about 
the discipline issue and tell me if 
you still want to run him out of Gainesville.
“I always tell players they’re go-
ing to make mistakes,” Muschamp said. “They’re going to make some 
poor choices and decisions, but 
help me help you. If you are will-ing to work with me, I’m willing to work with anybody. I’ll give 
you the shirt off my back to help 
you. And it’s through a growing process as a college student. So our guys, in my opinion, have bought into that. 
“They understand that we’re here to help them. They don’t buck at that very much and I think they have done a nice job for the most part.”

Jeff Driskel won’t just be 
responsible for taking care of 
the ball when the Gators are on offense.
According to UF’s depth 
chart for Saturday’s season opener against Idaho, which was released Tuesday, the redshirt junior quarterback is also the team’s starting holder on special teams.“I’d like to classify myself as a versatile player,” Driskel said. 
“I think it’s an opportunity 
to give the ﬁ  eld goal block team some issues. You have to give them more things to think about during the week.”
But there is uncertainty 
throughout the rest of Flori-da’s special teams unit.
The placekicker battle be-
tween Austin Hardin and 
Frankie Velez, which has been 
ongoing since spring camp, 
has yet to be decided.
Velez had the better year as 
a ﬁ  eld-goal kicker in 2013, go-
ing 6 of 8 on the season com-pared to Hardin’s 4-of-12 clip. 
Hardin improved through-
out the spring, connecting on all four of his ﬁ  eld goal tries during the Orange & Blue De-but game.
“Both guys had really 
strong camps,” coach Will Muschamp said, “but we can win with both guys, I do know that.”
The punter battle between 
Kyle Christy and Johnny Townsend has not been deter-mined either.
Following a sophomore 
season where he was named a ﬁ  nalist for the 2012 Ray Guy Award — which goes to the best punter in college football 
— Christy had a subpar 2013 
season, averaging just 39.6 yards per punt.
Muschamp replaced 
Christy with then-freshman Townsend for the ﬁ  nal six games of the season. 
Townsend had slightly 
higher numbers than Christy, 
averaging 42 yards per punt 
on 29 attempts.
“We’ll punt through the 
week and see where we go there,” Muschamp said.
Andre Debose will likely 
assume both kickoff and punt return duties as he returns for his sixth season at Florida.
The redshirt senior has four 
career kickoff return touch-downs, which is tied for the Southeastern Conference re-cord with Tennessee’s Willie Gault (1979-1982), Arkansas’ Felix Jones (2005-2007) and Georgia’s Brandon Boykin (2008-2011).Driskel to

Come Saturday, Florida will 
get the chance to ﬁ  nally bury the 
disaster that was the 4-8 season of 2013. It seemed the day would never come, but a clean slate for 
the program starts with its season 
opener against Idaho.
The Gators have not won a 
game in nearly 10 months — their last taste of winning came in a 30-10 victory over Arkansas on Oct. 5. For redshirt senior linebacker Mike Taylor, the opportunity to get a win can not come soon 
enough.
“Getting a win will deﬁ  nitely 
help, deﬁ  nitely help the whole 
feeling around the stadium,” Tay-lor said. “Because of the season we had last year and just to know that all the hard work we’ve been put-ting in all offseason and how we came together in camp. Knowing 
that that will have paid off and 
contribute to some wins, which I feel it will, that will just be the big-gest thing.”
Taylor returns to the defense 
as the leading tackler from 2013, racking up 62 total tackles, includ-ing 3.5 for loss. The defense as a whole returns seven starters from 
a unit that ﬁ  nished among the top 
two conference teams for all but one defensive category including rushing, passing and total de-fense.
Despite being part of consis-
tently dominant defenses through-out his time in Gainesville, Taylor believes this year’s unit has the potential to be one of the most suc-cessful ones that he has been a part of. A lot of that potential is due to its cohesiveness.  
“We’re playing together as a de-fense more than I’ve ever probably witnessed since I’ve been here,” Taylor said. “We’ve been playing together, there’s no pointing ﬁ  n-gers, there’s no ‘you should’ve did this, you should’ve did that.’ We all came together for a common goal to be the best defense, now it’s time for us to display it and ac-tually do that.”
While Taylor is one of the vet-
eran leaders on defense, returning quarterback Jeff Driskel is a lead-er both on offense and defense. Driskel, who will see the ﬁ  eld for the ﬁ  rst time since a season-ending injury suffered against Tennes-see last September, has earned the respect of his teammates coming back from the injury so positively.
“A lot of us weren’t able to ﬁ  n-
ish the season last year, so just that fact and knowing that we’re com-ing back and he’s coming back to lead the team, lead the offense. 
We’ve got a lot of respect for him 
because we know a lot of our suc-cess will be in his hands.”
The backup quarterback spot 
for the Idaho game was ﬁ  nally settled, as Muschamp announced Tuesday that true freshman Treon 
Harris will be quarterback num-
ber two against the Vandals. Har-ris won the job for Saturday over early enrollee Will Grier. 
“He just showed those leader-
ship signs which is probably why Muschamp gave him the backup job,” Taylor said. “He has great elusive ability and can throw in the 
pocket and on the run, like I said 
he makes quick decisions which is very effective in this offense.”
