n THE WOMAN USES A CANE AND 
WAS REFUSED A RIDE TO HER CAR.
By HUNTER SIZEMORE
Alligator Writer
A physically disabled woman was told 
“too bad, so sad” by a driver from Ultimate Towing after she asked for a ride to the lot where the company had towed her car, she said.
But walking to the lot was not an option 
for Ashley Gregg, 24. She uses with a cane due to degenerative disk disease, which af-fects the spine. She can travel no more than 
50 or 60 feet without resting.
“You get the ticket, you pay the fine,” 
Gregg said. “It’s more that I was left strand-
ed as a handicapped person that worries me.”When she walked to the parking lot after 
eating at Flaco’s Cuban Bakery, a tow truck driver, identified only as Driver No. 426, was towing another car, she said.
She asked the driver to take her to the lot, 
and he laughed at her and refused, she said.
The incident happened after she parked in 
what she said was an ambiguously marked 
lot behind Flaco’s and Durty Nelly’s Irish 
Pub, which turned out to be the property of 
the law agency next door.

When Mecha Franklin woke 
up Thursday morning, she found that no water was coming from her bathroom faucet and her toilet would not flush.
“I went to turn on the sink and 
it was like drip, drip, drip,” said Franklin, a UF psychology senior.
Many Gainesville residents like 
Franklin experienced cracked wa-ter pipelines due to the sub-freez-ing temperatures.
By 9 a.m., Gainesville Regional 
Utilities had re-ceived several calls regarding frozen and cracked pipe-
lines, said GRU employee Crystal Monroe. 
Monroe said usually the prob-
lem occurs when the backflow preventer, which connects pipes to prevent contamination, breaks or cracks. If this happens, it is the responsibility of the resident to fix it. 
Robin Schenk, a dispatcher for 
Mark Hurm and Co., a plumbing company in Gainesville, said peo-ple can prevent cracks by leaving water dripping or waiting until 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. to turn on a faucet.

Come fall, Santa Fe College will 
begin offering four-year degrees for 
the first time, which will put it in competition with UF for even more 
of the state’s already-scarce funds.
After getting approval from 
Florida’s Board of Education on 
Wednesday and the Southern 
Association of Colleges and Schools 
in December, Santa Fe has been cleared to offer bachelor’s degrees in clinical laboratory science and health services administration.
All of Florida’s 28 community 
colleges were given the option of of-fering four-year degrees after July 1, when a state law went into effect.
Santa Fe President Jackson Sasser 
said in order to get the degrees ap-proved, the college had to prove they were in demand. Sasser said not only is the demand for gradu-ates from these programs “off the 
charts,” the degrees aren’t offered 
at UF.
“Our best partner is the University of Florida, and we wouldn’t com-pete,” he said. “If this is something that they offered, we would not.”
But not everyone is sold on four-
year degrees from community col-leges.
UF President Bernie Machen 
questioned their worth in a July 
Gainesville Sun article.
UF spokes-
woman Janine 
Sikes said Machen was concerned 
about the lack of 
resources.
“His concern 
is that the legisla-
ture is not going to allocate addi-
tional dollars,” she said, adding that 
new four-year programs such as Santa Fe’s will only stretch the lim-ited funding currently available. 
Machen did not respond to an e-
mail sent Wednesday afternoon.
Sasser said Santa Fe hadn’t deter -
mined how much money it would 
request from the state to help fund 
the new degrees and declined to give an estimate.SFC adds four-

TALLAHASSEE (AP) — A majority of Floridians believe it is OK 
for gays and lesbians to adopt children.
A Quinnipiac University poll of 1,370 Floridians showed 55 
percent favor doing away with a state law that prohibits gays 
from adopting compared to 39 percent who want to keep the ban. Democrats and independent voters were in the majority favoring of eliminating the ban while Republicans and white evangelical Christians supported the law.
But only 27 percent said gays should be allowed to marry while 
35 percent favored civil unions and 31 percent said there should be no legal recognition of gay unions.n A local

She may not have worn Michelle 
Obama’s flowing Jason Wu gown, 
but Cynthia Russell celebrated President Barack Obama’s inaugu-
ration in style.
Russell was one of 10 people 
who won tickets to the inaugura-
tion through an essay contest spon-
sored by the Presidential Inaugural 
Committee.“It was all so exciting,” Russell 
said.
On Saturday, she walked from 
her plane to a waiting car that drove 
her and her boyfriend to check into the Capitol Hill Suites Hotel.
They took in the sights and 
sounds of the “We Are One” concert at the Lincoln Memorial Sunday.
Dressed in a deep purple, velvet 
dress and a well-used pair of silver 
Manolo Blahniks, Russell mingled 
with her fellow contest-winners at 
Union Station Monday night for a bipartisan dinner in honor of then Vice President-elect Joe Biden.
The highlight of the night for 
her was a musical performance by Carole King. King’s album “Tapestry” was the first album Russell ever bought.
Tuesday morning, Russell 
trekked to Capitol Hill for Obama’s swearing-in. She maneuvered through long lines, security check-points and police barricades before 
settling in a spot northwest of the 
Capitol.
Temperatures were low, but 
spirits were high.
“There was energy in the air,” 
Russell said. “It was just incredible. Everyone got bit by the Obama bug.”
At the Neighborhood Inaugural 
Ball that evening, Russell donned a simple black dress and watched the first couple slow dance to Beyonce’s soulful rendition of Etta James’ “At Last.” 
Although the night showcased 
Obama dipping to the ground to do 
“the bump,” it could not trump the 
day’s proceedings.
“It’s one of those things that you 
just have to be there to experience it,” Russell said.Newberry woman experiences inauguration in style

Coward ran.
Van Michael Coward, 22, was arrested 
and charged with burglary of a business, larceny and resisting arrest without vio-lence. 
At 5:02 a.m. Thursday, two Gainesville 
Police Department officers were sent to White Apron Catering, 2201 N.E. 2nd St., where a store alarm was triggered. When they arrived they heard noises coming from inside the building, the GPD arrest report 
stated.When the officers tried to approach 
Coward, he ran across Northeast Second 
Street.
He did not obey when the 
officers told him to stop, so K-9 officer Charles Owens sent his police dog to catch 
him, said GPD spokesman Keith Kameg.
According to the report, after he was caught by the dog, Coward was taken to North Florida Regional Hospital for  minor injuries due to dog bites.
Coward took about $550 worth of  
food and table linens from White Apron Catering, the report stated. He told police he was sleeping in a shed on the business’ property for the past two nights and went 
inside because he was cold. Man fleeing police charged with larceny, resisting arrest

 THERE WERE THREE HOMICIDES 
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY IN 2008.
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Writer
Kemmets@alligator.org
Three homicides occurred in Alachua 
County in 2008, and police predict that the 
ailing economy will cause the number to 
rise.
The projected crime increase combined 
with budget cuts might force the sheriff’s of-
fice to do more with  less, according to the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman 
Steve Maynard.
He added that most of the Alachua 
County homicides last year were drug re-
lated.
“When income goes down and jobs are 
lost, people start to get desperate,” Maynard said. “We expect to see an increase of theft, burglary, robbery and homicides.”
With everyone trying to do as much 
as they can to pinch pennies, the Alachua 
County Commission might cut law enforce-
ment’s budget this year, Maynard said.
“There is going to be a breaking point and 
we don’t want it to be the service provided to Alachua County residents,” he said.
Maynard said if he were a civilian, he 
would want there to be less funding for county projects and more funding for safety 
and law enforcement. 
“My personal protection is up there with 
food and sleep,” he said. “I do not want to 
be burglarized, raped or murdered.”
Lonn Lanza-Kaduce, academic chair of 
the UF criminology department, said that age may have a direct relationship to violent trends.For example, a community with high 
numbers of retirees is unlikely to have much crime, but  a community with many young adults is likely to have more crime.
In Gainesville, many people are young 
but educated, so homicide rates tend to be low. 
Although the amount of crime is pro-
jected to rise, Lanza-Kaduce said that an improvement in Gainesville’s Emergency Medical Service might keep down the num-ber of homicides.
“Alachua County may have higher vio-
lence than others, but that violence might not translate to homicides,” he said in re-gards to the increase of technology and the 
availability of medicine.
But Lanza-Kaduce added 
that the economic downturn might have an effect on a 
county even as insulated as Alachua. 
He added that a lot of homicides grow 
out of domestic violence. Job loss constraints 
and consumption of drugs and alcohol are 
also contributing factors.
According to the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement Web site, there were 581 homicides in Florida in 2008. 
In Alachua County, there were 6,200 
crimes reported for 2008. Of those, 66 were forcible rape, 151 were robbery, 750 were ag-gravated assault and 1,278 were burglary. 
Alachua county homicide rates have 
been consistently low since 2000, the first 
year listed on the Web site. 
There were six Alachua County homi-
cides in 2004, the year in which the number 
was highest.  Miami-Dade county led the state in homicides for 2008 with 122. Orange County followed it with 64, according to the Web site.Homicides low in Alachua

Beekeeper Nancy Gentry has 
never worn a full bee suit, and 
sometimes she omits the veil too.  
“I’ve grown accustomed to the 
bees and the stings,” said Gentry, former president of the Northeast Florida Honey Bee Association.  “I don’t get stung very often. I moved eight hives one time and never got stung.” 
Gentry is hosting a meeting 
this Saturday in east Palatka to help beekeepers network and en-courage them to start their own clubs. Gentry said there are many registered beekeepers in Alachua County who are interested in form-
ing a local club.
The Honey Bee Association’s 
meetings are held in Green Cove 
Springs, about 50 miles Northeast 
of Gainesville. Beekeepers from 
Alachua, St. Johns, Putnam and 
Volusia often cannot make the trip.  
Gentry owes a lot of her skill 
to her 90-year-old mentor, George 
Waldoch, who has been beekeep-
ing for 75 years.
Gentry started beekeeping five 
years ago and had only two hives. 
She hopes to have as many as 40 to 
60 hives this spring. 
“It’s important to have an older 
beekeeper to mentor you,” Gentry 
said. “This is why the beekeeping clubs and associations are so im-
portant.”
Gentry said Floridians have a 
growing interest in local products, 
including honey, causing more and 
more beekeepers to emerge.  
The Northeast Florida Honey 
Bee Association started with only 
12 people, and when Gentry left 
the presidency in December, there were 120 members.  
“Beekeepers are just wonderful 
people; it’s a strange fellowship 
that we have,” she said. “It’s very rewarding and incredibly exciting 
when you produce your first jar of 
honey.”  
Jerry Hayes, chief of the apiary 
inspection section for the Florida 
Department of Agriculture, also 
agrees beekeepers will benefit from 
networking.
“I think (the benefit) is aware-
ness; it’s education,” Hayes said.  
Hayes leads a team of 14 full-
time apiary inspectors, who work with the 1,200 registered beekeep-
ers in Florida, altogether boasting more than 200,000 hives. Hayes said bees provide pollination for 
fruits, nuts and berries.
“And then there’s the subset of 
people that really embrace insects,” 
Hayes said. “They want to raise 
awareness to people that these in-
sects are beneficial to the environ-
ment.”  
Hayes said beekeepers are 
reaching out and helping the com-
munity and environment because 
their bees stray up to 2.5 miles from 
their hives. 
“You’ve got people who are 
stamp collectors, you’ve got people 
who collect model airplanes — ev-
eryone has their hobbies,” Hayes 
said. “But this is one hobby that benefits the whole community.”
n ELECTRONIC RESOURCES MAKE UP ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF BUDGET.
By MICHAEL DeVOOGD 
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students spending hours at Library 
West may have to start staring at their com-
puters instead of flipping through books.
To cope with Gainesville’s budget defi-
cit, UF libraries have reallocated funds from 
printed materials to online resources.
According to the 2009 budget for library 
materials, UF libraries have moved money from monographs and print subscriptions to electronic journals, databases and books — a move some students and faculty may prefer. 
UF libraries have a flat budget of about 
$7.9 million, which is the same as last year, according to the budget. But inflation has caused a $700,000 increase in library mate-rial costs.
Collection managers in UF departments 
have been tasked with deciding what mate-rials to cut this fiscal year, while still ensur -
ing essential books remain untouched.
“Everything is of value to somebody, or 
we wouldn’t be buying it to begin with,” said Judy Russell, dean of university librar -
ies. “But they do try to look at what are the least used databases.”Russell said monographs, books about 
one specific topic, are most often cut because 
they can be obtained through inter-library 
loans, which reached 50,000 last year.
According to Russell, the habits of UF stu-
dents and faculty have changed, and now, electronic resources 
make up about 60 percent of the 
total budget. 
“I think a lot of our students and faculty 
prefer the online resources,” Russell said. 
“They like being able to get at them 24/7. 
They like the searchability and the cut and paste.”
Some UF professors have become 
alarmed by the unavailability of important monographs in the libraries.
R. Allen Shoaf, a UF English professor, 
said he sees a steady reduction in the money allotted for books in his department.
Shoaf said he believes the unavailability 
of certain books can have a big impact on his  
students’ abilities to learn the material he 
teaches.
“Critical monographs are expressions of 
informed, scholarly opinion,” Shoaf said.
He added that the monographs train stu-
dents to critically compare competing opin-
ions. 
“It hurts us when we have to cut some-
thing,” Russell said. “It’s a matter of choos-ing as carefully as we can.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 23, 2009 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Alligator staffers sacrifice social lives
Today’s question: Is society too 
dependent on technology?
217 TOTAL VOTES25% YES75% NO Monday’s question: Is Michelle Obama the new “Jackie O”?Column
My day starts at 11 a.m. when I roll out of bed. Some 
days I’ll head to the gym, others I won’t. I occasion-ally go to class. But the one constant in my life — 
aside from Leo’s rolls — is the Alligator.
My iPhone is constantly blowing up with work-related 
e-mails. I spend a lot of time forwarding them along to edi-tors. 
When I do sleep, I dream of missing deadlines.Of computer failures like the one I experienced on my 
first night of work.
Of the surely faulty electrical system starting a fire that de-
stroys the building and arriving to a pile of scorched rubble.
The newsroom has become my home, and my co-workers 
have become my family. My mom knows not to call me dur -
ing the week unless it’s an emergency because I’m probably at work or doing something work-related.
And the same applies for the other people who work 
alongside me in the 5:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. grind of putting out a daily newspaper.
This doesn’t leave a lot of time for normal college student 
pursuits I used to engage in like homework, class, Thursday night dancing at the Atlantic or any semblance of a romantic life.
And these troubles come with the territory when you 
dedicate yourself to the paper, which is necessary of anyone serious enough to work here.
I’m lucky to have an understanding significant other who 
is OK with speaking to me in short bursts throughout the day and in between stories as I edit each night.
It also helps that she lives a few hours south in Orlando. 
Distance can be a good thing sometimes, especially when hanging out during the week would be impossible. I’ve learned to appreciate the time we  get to spend together that much more.
But for those staffers who are trying to kindle new flames 
in Gainesville during their tenure at the newspaper, dating gets pretty complicated.After all, assuming you make it 
out of the newsroom for long enough 
to meet someone you’d be interested 
in dating, it’s kind of hard to ask someone out on a date that begins at 1:30 in the morning. 
And it’s not exactly sexy to be an-
swering work-related calls constant-ly while trying to remember what 
the heck your date was talking about 
over a dinner you probably can’t af-
ford on your three-dollar-an-hour salary.
But this doesn’t seem to dissuade us from trying. And 
again, when we are able to get out of work, that time off is 
so much sweeter. 
We live for Saturday , when we can decompress and have 
a few beers.
After this four-day week, which has felt like an eight-day 
week with inauguration coverage and larger papers than 
usual, I find myself especially craving a day out of my office. Being so dedicated to what we do here shows in our finished 
product. When we put the paper to bed every night, we get 
a sense of satisfaction that can be best described as similar to putting a child to bed after a straight-A report card and ice 
cream sundaes for all.
Seeing the paper through the window in the orange boxes 
in the morning validates us. The older man on the exercise bike next to me who read the Alligator as he worked out this 
morning brought a smile to my face. Heck, even if you just 
pick up the paper for the crossword and the comic, we still 
appreciate you. Maybe one day you’ll read a story or two.
We’re here because we love being here and our No. 1 pri-
ority is serving you, our audience. Let us know how we’re doing. Send us a letter to the editor at letters@alligator.org.

Monday’s holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. couldn’t have come at a better time. 
As tests and term papers creep closer into view, we wel-
comed the extended weekend to mentally prepare ourselves 
for a semester free of football games and an NCAA tourney 
appearance. 
Just think — spring break is less than two months away!Until then we offer you the consolation prize of this week’s 
history-making editon of...
Darts & Laurels
For the typical UF student, the time-tested act of tossing 
back a Natural Light or two has nothing to do with prefer -
ence. 
Heck, the Editorial Board dreams about the days in which 
we are gainfully employed — equipped with bank accounts 
able to withstand the purchase of brews like Anchor Steam 
or Newcastle. To the woman who left her purse behind af-
ter robbing the local Sweetbay, we pour her a why-couldn’t-she-have-sprung-for-the-good-stuff DART for stealing a few 
cases of Natty Light. 
We can only shake our heads and wonder what she drinks 
when she actually pays for her booze.
The Editorial Board would like to take the opportunity to 
LAUREL the Academy for heeding the outcry of the general 
public in giving the Joker his due. For his efforts in “The Dark Knight,” Heath Ledger stands to compete for Oscar glory with a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nomination. 
We hope the recognition for his performance will bring a 
semblance of solace to Ledger’s family as Tuesday marked the anniversary of his death.
With all the positive attention UF receives from its athletic 
conquests on the basketball court and football field, you have to admit we were bound for a misstep. For his arrest Saturday 
evening with a bag of coke, we toss a say-it-ain’t-so DART at 
UF professor Michael Heckenberger — an otherwise talent-ed researcher who garnered the respect of his peers. 
We can’t help but frown whenever anyone from The Gator 
Nation ends up in jail, but it’s especially disheartening when the individual has made an otherwise positive impact in the community. 
The image of two 8-year-old boys with baseball bats con-
jures imagery of Little League Baseball and overzealous par -
ents — not saving the life of a woman in distress.
Responding to the screams of his mother, a local child 
along with his pal grabbed their baseball bats and started hitting the woman’s armed ex-boyfriend. The Editorial Board presents the two young heroes an always-swing-for-the-fences LAUREL for their courageous actions in deterring 
a would-be killer.
Somewhere the Tampa Bay Rays are mulling a contract 
offer.
Anytime our cell phones notify us of a new text message, 
the Editorial Board tends to light up with excitement. Maybe it’s the news of a raging keg party down the block or a po-tential booty call; regardless, we welcome the distraction. But when you misuse technology intended to warn us of threats on campus we don’t exactly crack a smile. 
For his oh-so-funny joke Tuesday evening, we send a we-
forgot-to-laugh DART the way of the mystery mass-texter. 
Couldn’t he have just spent his night watching inauguration 
coverage like the rest of us?
The streets of Washington overflowed with glowing faces 
as the masses gathered to share in the joy of Tuesday’s inau-
guration of President Barack Obama. For coming together in celebration of an historic moment, the Editorial Board awards a we-can-all-just-get-along LAUREL to America. 
If but for one day, people from all walks of life put aside 
their differences to recognize the strides made by our great country.
That’s all for this week. You stay classy, UF.

Letters to the Editor
Mobile Campus needs revision
In a letter to the editor last 
January , I expressed concern 
over UF’s decision to use Mobile 
Campus to provide emergency text 
messages. 
These concerns returned 
Tuesday night when many students 
received a message that read, “The 
monkey got out of the cage,” from a Mobile Campus number. During a real emergency, the system could be flooded with messages such as this 
one to prevent or delay the sending 
of emergency messages. 
This is a clear threat to our safety, 
and these security issues must be 
addressed.

  Senate debate should be civil
The spring election is almost 
upon us, and with it comes the usual 
flurry of campaigning and advertis-
ing for all political parties involved. 
In the coming weeks the edito-
rial pages will be full of opinion 
pieces supporting or accusing vari-
ous candidates. Turlington and the 
Union will be encircled by eager campaigners handing out fliers and touting party slogans. Finally, Freshman Leadership Council will 
host the presidential debates where 
all students have an opportunity to meet the executive candidates and ask hard questions about their posi-
tions. 
This yearly process serves to in-
form students about the candidates 
for election and encourage them to make their voices count by voting. One place these activities should not be taking place is on the floor of the Student Senate. It is entirely inap-propriate for senators of any party to make overt campaign statements 
during the time allotted for student 
business. 
We are elected to represent our 
constituents and serve their inter -
ests, not promote or disparage a particular legislative slate or execu-tive ticket. I appeal to senators of both parties to keep debate civil, thoughtful and focused on the gen-
uine needs of the students.

Column manipulates message
I have no idea what dictionary Johnathan Lott is using to look up  
words, but his attempts to read “so-cialist” policies into Obama’s inau-guration speech were comical.
For one thing, my dictionary 
defines “socialism” as a theory that calls for “the ownership and opera-tion of the means of production and distribution by society of the com-
munity rather than by private indi-
viduals.” 
Absolutely nothing Obama said 
could reasonably be construed as advocating such a system. 
Furthermore, all of Lott’s inter -
pretations of Obama’s claims were incredible distortions of the content of Obama’s statements.
For instance, Lott quotes Obama 
as saying “the market can spin out of control — and that a nation can-not prosper long when it favors only the prosperous.” Lott then says this “basically” implies that “the free market failed some people, so we need to more equitably redistribute its spoils.” 
How Obama’s practically plati-
tudinous claim “implies” (or “ba-sically implies,” whatever that means) Lott’s reading is, to put it 
very gently , unclear.  
We cannot make words mean 
anything we like — a point that 
needs to be taken very seriously when it comes to matters of national 
importance.
My advice to Johnathan Lott 
would be to invest in a new diction-
ary before his next column is due 
next week. The one he has now is 
clearly no good.

Column
I first realized I was a technology-lover 
when I witnessed the power of Google. No more encyclopedias, books or effort for 
me, I thought. This six-letter word is going to make the rest of high school a piece of cake.
I discovered I was actually a technology-
hater the first day I caught a glimpse of a guy shouting into a hands-free cell phone headset. In the words of Dee of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” I wondered if the guy rocking the Bluetooth was part robot and part jack-ass.
Since that unfortunate first sighting, I’ve 
continued to witness the technological shack-
les relentlessly grind American carpals into 
chalk.
The most horrifying aspect of this electron-
ic reign of terror is that we are at the mercy of lithium-ion batteries, and there is no escape.
If you own a laptop, you better pray to 
the recently mechanized gods your battery lasts more than a year — or at least putters out before the end of the extended warranty 
you purchased. Otherwise, your inconsistent “Twittering” will leave your friends fright-
ened and befuddled because they couldn’t figure out what you did from 2:15 to 2:45 last Wednesday afternoon.
Friends don’t leave friends hanging on 
Twitter.
There is no way to circumvent this prob-
lem. Society cannot function on desktops alone — the thought is laughable. What if you need a vanilla latte and YouTube at the same time? You can’t have one without the other; they go together like lamb and tuna fish.
Obviously , you aren’t going to tote your 
70-pound HP behemoth to the corner to 
set up shop at your friendly neighborhood 
Starbucks. Committing such a crime against the technological dictatorship would result in scoffs, eye-rolling and maybe even a good, old-fashioned stoning.
Using newer technology like Google 
phones and iPhones may seem like a solu-tion to the cumbersome burden of desktops, but these so-called breakthroughs only bring 
you back to the lithium-ion palace to grovel at the feet of the almighty 
battery.
Don’t get me started 
on the evils of the iPod. The click-wheel plague 
has laid waste to nearly 
every drop of congenial human interaction left flowing through the blood of our species. 
Once they went Nano, our white blood cells didn’t stand a chance.
The most identifiable player in the techno-
logical regime is also the combatant that de-
serves the majority of the blame for America’s 
gadget dependence: the cell phone.
The foot soldiers of this war, cell phones 
toil in the trenches (rather, human ear canals) for thousands of minutes per month. For their troubles, they are broken on a daily basis. Countless cell phones are left for dead in hot tubs, Solo cups and toilets nationwide.
The success of the information infantry is 
ensured by Americans’ need to talk, text or at least clutch a cell phone at all times for no apparent reason. Thus, despite the ever-in-creasing number of casualties, the cell phone assault never wavers.
Millions of Americans are foolish enough 
to buy into the notion that these technological “advances” make life easier for all of us. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
These gadgets and gizmos are incessantly nib-bling away at the corners of humanity.
We don’t need to halt technological ad-
vances; President Harry Truman learned the horrors of the no-holds-barred approach. Instead, we need to reassess ourselves as so-
cial beings.
If we continue our current pace, one day 
we’ll all wake up in vats of translucent, pink 
goo with USB ports implanted all over our bodies.
In the event of this worst-case scenario 
only one thing is certain: You will not want to disconnect without properly ejecting first.

TODAY IN SPORTS HISTORY ON TELEVISIONBy MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
It was a finish more suited for 
March than January, but when 
South Carolina’s Zam Fredrick handed UF a buzzer-beating 
defeat Wednesday night, it felt 
like déjà vu.
No. 24 UF (16-3, 3-1 
Southeastern Conference) 
hoped to follow up its re-entry 
into the national ranks with a 
win, but in what seemed like 
the blink of an eye, a missed Chandler Parsons free throw 
and a blown de-
fensive assign-
ment left the 
Gators shaking their heads once again. 
Three seconds of shock were 
followed by pandemonium in Columbia, S.C.
As fans attempted to storm 
the court, the distraught Gators 
were left in their white cinder 
block locker room, alone with 
their thoughts.
While dejected teammates 
sat behind a closed door, Nick 
Calathes composed himself and 
faced the media.
“They played better than 
us,” Calathes said. “But we’ll be 
ready (next time). We’re going to work hard and keep getting better.”
Calathes may have lost the 
game, but perhaps he won something even more impor -tant.
He’s long been the Gators’ 
general on the court, but stand-ing outside that locker room in a dimly lit hallway of the Colonial Life Arena, Calathes protected his men in a way he never had before.
“You come across certain 
guys who really, really love the game, and he loves the game,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “You know how important the game is to him. That’s some-
thing I respect. 
“He’s meant a lot to our 
team.”

It’s a slow time of year for the 
major UF sports.
Football is relatively silent 
until spring practice starts up in 
three months. 
Softball and baseball are still 
weeks away from beginning. 
I’d be lying if I said I knew 
much about the women’s basket-ball team besides its record and roster. 
And there’s no point writing 
a column about how devastating the men’s basketball team’s loss was Wednesday night against South Carolina. I don’t want to rub that in. (But seriously, what a phenomenal pass that was for the Gamecocks’ layup as the clock ex-pired.)
I n s t e a d 
of all that, I want to settle a little debate. 
In the 
A l l i g a t o r office, we love arguing about stu-pid things. 
We spent two hours Wednesday night debating the top 10 bands of all time, for example. One dispute we’ve been unable to settle in the last two years is this one: What is the greatest sports video game of all time?
Alligator readers, I’m relying 
on you to help us out. 
Send me an e-mail with your 
choices or add them as comments to the online version of this col-umn, and after one week of receiv-ing responses, we’ll post an online vote with the top five responses.
Here are some suggestions to 
get you started. This obviously is not a comprehensive list, and it neglects newer games.

Call them the Twin Towers, or name 
them what you will.
Just know one thing: When 6-foot-4 
Azania Stewart and 6-foot-3 Aneika Henry enter the game, it’s time for the other team to make some adjustments.
But there is one fact that might surprise 
you: The two interior forces have never played in a game together at the same time.
That all could change very soon, may-be even in the No. 15 Gators’ (17-2, 3-1 
Southeastern Conference) game against 
Mississippi (13-6, 2-2 SEC) on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
The duo has seen increased time on the 
court lately and has brought a spark to the team when starting post players Marshae Dotson and Sharielle Smith have a seat on the bench.
There has not been much of a drop-off, if 
any at all, in the level of play when the two enter the game, and Henry has only one ex-planation for why that may be so.
“I guess it’s because we’re internation-
al,” she said with a laugh.Henry, a senior from Jamaica, and 
Stewart, a freshman from England, have built a relationship on and off the court be-cause of their similar positions and foreign backgrounds.
Stewart’s father is Jamaican as well, 
and it’s something the two have fun with around the rest of the team.
“I’m the only one who understands 
her sometimes when she goes off on her Jamaican rant,” Stewart said.
The centers give each other advice 
during practice and games, and it always International duo brings size, laughs

Alligator Writer 
Road meets may not be nearly 
as fun, but for the UF gymnas-
tics team, Fayetteville, Ark., isn’t too shabby as a home away from home.
The UF gymnastics team trav-
els there for its first road meet this season and second Southeastern 
Conference meet. The No. 1 
Gators (2-0, 1-0 SEC) will look to improve a perfect 18-0 lifetime re-cord against the No. 8 Razorbacks (2-1, 0-0 SEC) tonight at 8. 
“(We) always hit (our routines) 
closer on the road,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “This team has always done very well in 
Arkansas.” 
If the Gators are to repeat 
their historic success against the 
Razorbacks, they will have to do so by improving on a balance beam performance that could have cost them a win last Friday.
Faehn said in practice that All-
American Melanie Sinclair would 
lead off on beam to begin the 
match with a more mature and ag-gressive competitor.
“We want to be able to see her 
go out there and get the team off to a good start,” Faehn said.
Faehn added that the lineup 
on uneven bars and floor exercise will remain the same. The team 
is ranked first nationally in both 
events, and they were integral in 
the win against Auburn.
If the team can muster the per -
formances on bars and floor they did early this year, UF can notch 19 in a row against Arkansas.
The only thing possibly stand-
ing in the way of win No. 19 may be a beat-up Gators team. Injuries to Rebekah Zaiser, who is out for the year with a broken foot, and Amanda Castillo, who is nursing bursitis in her ankle and is being used sparingly, have depleted a bit of the team’s depth.
“Now that we don’t have that 
much depth, we need to fight for every single handstand, pointed toe, straight knees, stuck landing,” 
Castillo said. 
Less depth means more of the 
brunt is placed on freshmen.
“You kind of just have to step 
up to the plate and do it for your 
team,” said Elizabeth Mahlich.
The freshman competed in 
three of the four events against Auburn, including anchoring the 
floor lineup with a 9.875.
Freshmen aren’t the only ones 
contributing more.
Junior Courtney Gladys, whose 
task was taking over Zaiser’s 
spot leading off on beam, said, “Rhonda always prepares us to be able to step in at any moment.”
And Castillo, who has been 
relegated to more of a leader-off-the-mat role, said she’s aching to be out on the floor but realizes she needs to be rested for the end of the season.
“It’s killing me not to be out 
there right now,” Castillo said. “This is something that has never happened to me before. I’ve had 
injuries but I’ve gotten over them 
by the time competition season comes around.”
Castillo still planned to com-
pete on bars and beam Friday, but will likely sit out floor and vault.
Faehn said the team shouldn’t 
be flustered by the fact that this is the first road meet of the year.
“It’s really not tremendously 
different on the road, other than just the crowd factor for us,” she said. “It shouldn’t matter if there’s 10,000 people cheering against us.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 23, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 15

game systems laid the ground-work for future games like Top 
Spin and Virtua Tennis. 
NBA Jam Tournament 
Edition: A personal favorite, 
NBA Jam may have cemented flashy dunking in the minds 
of a generation. Where else 
can you go back in time and 
play as the Seattle Supersonics 
with Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton? Where else do the 
Mailman and John Stockton 
hook up with ease? And the 
turbo system built into Jam became a staple for plenty of sports games in the future. 
Midway’s NFL Blitz series 
was a direct descendant of 
NBA Jam.
NHL ’94: This masterpiece brought the one-timer to hock-
ey video games. It also fea-
tured smooth gameplay, shoo-
tout mode and player profiles. 
This game is the reason I love hockey, and it gets my vote, 
hands down. But don’t let me 
persuade you — I’m prob-
ably one of 100 people on this 
campus who is passionate 
about hockey to the point of 
screaming at the television. I 
hate to think of this game be-
ing left out of the top five, but 
I wouldn’t be surprised if it 
were absent from the final poll 
considering my audience.
Tecmo Super Bowl: You didn’t 
think I’d forget about this one, 
did you? Not much needs 
to be said about this classic 
Nintendo football game. Two 
words really do justice to 
this game’s awesomeness: Bo 
Jackson. Tecmo Super Bowl 
also included the ability to 
play an entire NFL season.
Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!: 
The name on the box might 
not have the same impact it 
did in 1987, but Punch-Out 
still hits hard. You guide Little 
Mac through progressively 
tougher boxing matches until 
the final duel with Tyson.
Ken Griffey, Jr. Presents 
Major League Baseball: 
Assistant Sports Editor Adam 
Berry simply says he would 
describe this game as “the 
truth.” Who cares if you didn’t 
get to control real players 
when you can take the field 
with as “D. Crime”  and  “A. 
Hamilton”?
That’s all for this list. Send 
in your votes, and I’ll start 
counting.The sickest man in South Carolina 
Wednesday was Dan Werner.
Werner, who Donovan often refers to as 
his best defensive player, took a false step in 
the game’s final minutes that landed much of the blame squarely on his shoulders.
“(Fredrick) got behind Dan on the play. I 
thought Dan ... just put Alex (Tyus near the basket) and (himself) back, and (Fredrick) just got behind Dan. That’s what it boiled down to,” Donovan said. 
Neither Parsons nor Werner addressed 
the media following the game.
The Gators left 4 points on the court in the 
game’s final 13 seconds because of missed free throws.
“I’ve never been a big believer in moral 
victories,” Donovan said. “Do guys like Chandler and Nick stay late in the gym and take extra free throws? Does Dan Werner provide the kind of leadership we need on the floor late in the game? That’s what I’m anxious to see.”Now, UF will try to make sure one heart-
break doesn’t lead to a second when they make the trip to Nashville, Tenn., to take on Vanderbilt (12-6, 1-3 SEC) Sunday on nation-al television. 
The Gators lost a gut-wrenching 61-58 
game at Memorial Gym last season when Calathes committed a backcourt violation with 24 seconds to play.
“Had we won (Wednesday) night, it 
would have only gone down as one ‘W.’ We lost, and it’s one game,” Donovan said. “We have to rebound here.” UF seeks revenge against Vanderbilt on Sunday
seems like they’re laughing 
about something.
Whether it’s in pregame 
meals, in the locker room or during a game, their likable per -
sonalities draw their teammates to them and create a fun envi-
ronment for a squad that’s in 
the heart of conference play.
“If somebody fouls us be-
cause we’re big, they never real-ly give us the benefit,” Stewart said. “If we’ve got girls hanging off our arms and they won’t call anything, we laugh about that, but that’s the game.”
Assistant coach Susie 
Gardner, who works with the post players, said she has imag-ined what it would be like with 
Stewart and Henry side-by-
side.
“As soon as SEC play started, 
we started thinking that would be a great tandem because the height disadvantage that we have every single game,” Gardner said. “We have toyed 
with it a little bit in prac-
tice. On paper 
and looking at them standing on the baseline 
and walking 
through the airport, you think, 
‘Man, what a great tandem that would be.’”
Stewart is optimistic about the possibility of soon playing alongside her fellow height-advantaged, foreign-born team-mate.
“They’re planning to,” 
Stewart said. “We’ve been prac-ticing together. When a big game comes up when we need a height advantage, the Twin 
Towers will be there.
“I can’t wait until they actu-
ally do put us in.”
The rest of the SEC might not 
feel the same way.
