UF Chief of Police Linda Stump and 
Gainesville Police Chief Tony Jones host-
ed a press conference Monday afternoon at the UF Police Department regarding the recent string of assault cases both on 
or near UF’s campus in the last 10 days.
“Safety on our campus is a shared re-
sponsibility,” Stump said as the confer-
ence began. 
Stump said UPD, Gainesville Police, 
the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and Santa Fe College are joining forces to catch the man who police believe as-saulted a fourth woman Sunday night.
All four victims put up a ﬁ  ght, Stump 
said, which attracted attention and even-tually stopped each assault. 
“They fought, they yelled, they de-
fended themselves, and they did it very well,” Stump said.
In each case, the man ﬂ  ed the scene 
on foot.
All departments are urging the com-
munity to join in the effort to ﬁ  nd the in-
dividual responsible for these crimes. VOLUME 109 ISSUE 11 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2014

CAMPUS ASSAULTS
ASHLEIGH HICKS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Television camera crews and concerned 
students swarmed the Plaza of the Ameri-
cas on Monday in support of heightened 
campus safety.
The event, titled “No Gator Walks 
Alone,” was organized in light of four 
incidents of assault and battery reported 
within nine days, the ﬁ  rst on Sept. 30 after 
the canceled Gators season opener.
Trees were draped with colorful ban-
ners decorated with names of supporters, the hashtag #sticktogether and phrases 
like “No Gator Walks Alone.”
One of the event coordinators, Nikki 
Steinberger, a UF student personnel in 
higher education graduate student, or-
ganized the rally to include speakers and 
tips about how to stay safe on campus.
“One of my friends mentioned, ‘I can’t 
believe this happened in our community,’ and it really is a community,” said Stein-
berger, 24. 
“That’s kind of sparked the idea of ‘we 
need to come together,’” she said.
Speakers at the event included Stein-
berger, UF Police Chief Linda Stump and 
Student Body President Cory Yeffet. 
Stump praised the efforts of the four 
victims in her address to the crowd. 
“These four individuals were very 
brave,” Stump said. “They fought. They made noise, and in certain instances, peo-ple were around to come to their aid.”UF students come together in assault aftermath

about campus assaults� 72 STUDENTS HAVE QUALIFIED.

After a record low turnout Sunday for stu-
dents interested in running for a UF Student 
Senate seat, Monday drew enough applicants to ﬁ  ll the Fall 2014 Student Government elec-tions ballot.
The second day of qualifying in the Reitz 
Union Ballroom drew 61 students, a result consistent with past qualifying rounds, said UF Supervisor of Elections Hans Rojas.
A total of 72 students have qualiﬁ  ed since 
Sunday.
“Historically, day three has the highest 
turnout of candidates,” Rojas said.
In previous election cycles, qualifying 
and slating began Monday and ran through Wednesday. UF election codes now specify that qualifying must be completed by Tues-day at 5 p.m.
Because of GatorNights on Friday and the 
football game on Saturday, Rojas said the Re-
itz Union Grand Ballroom was only available 
on Sunday.
All but one of Monday’s 61 students slat-
ed — or chose to run with a registered po-litical party — with Swamp Party. Students who have not slated have until the end of a mandatory meeting at the Reitz Union Au-ditorium at 9 p.m. Wednesday to slate with a party or ﬁ  le a form to run as an independent 
candidate.
“I think we weren’t extremely surprised 
about there being a low turnout,” Swamp 
Party spokeswoman Katie Backstrand said about Sunday’s qualifying round. “So today was deﬁ  nitely more of what we were expect-ing with how many people showed up.”
Qualifying ends at 5 p.m. today.Election slating continues

Linda Stump sipped her Coke through a 
thin straw as she drove her red Ford Explor-
er through UF’s campus Monday night. 
“I’m not a coffee drinker,” said UF’s 
Chief of Police, tapping the silver thermos 
the soda splashed around in. 
She needed the carbonated caffeine. She’s 
not used to working nights.
And neither are the 26 ofﬁ  cers UPD 
switched to night shifts following Sunday’s 
assault on campus, the fourth since Aug. 30.
All four victims of the attacks gave simi-
lar descriptions of the perpetrator, a white male at least 6 feet tall with a large build. He 
remains at large.
 Where 12 ofﬁ  cers once patrolled campus 
alone, ofﬁ  cers from UPD and Gainesville Po-
lice now monitored the streets. A K-9 unit stationed itself near the Reitz Union. Ofﬁ  cers on bikes whizzed up and around Newell Drive. And about 20 volunteers from cam-pus organizations wore reﬂ  ective ﬂ  uorescent vests and walked in pairs, escorting students 
safely through campus. 
At each glance, a cop car, ofﬁ  cer or vol-
unteer was visible. Yet as Stump pulled 
her SUV up onto a curb near McCarty Hall, pockets of darkness seeped into view. 
Fronds glowed green under the bright 
beam of her headlights. As she stepped out of the car and slammed the door behind her, the lights snapped off. Despite a single light 
post, the small path between McCarty build-
ings B and C was black again.
“This is where it happened,” she said, re-
ferring to Sunday’s assault. She walked for-ward, passing a bright blue emergency light and the hum of a few vending machines as she disappeared into the darkness. “Now imagine it’s pouring rain.”
She ran through the incident: A man 
grabbed a woman from behind, hitting her and pulling her down. They wrestled around for a bit before he ran off. 
Trees that shade students in the day shel-
tered the predator that night.
The woman called the cops. But he was 
gone. And suddenly, the ofﬁ  cers on the streets 
didn’t seem like enough.
“This isn’t an impossible feat,” Stump 
said, “but we need some luck.”
■   ■   ■
Just before 9 p.m. Monday, about 25 
women spilled out of UPD headquarters and onto the sidewalk. There they waited, paired off, before loading into Student Nighttime 
Auxiliary Patrol vans and police cars and 
heading out.
The women had just ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst of 
four Rape Aggression Defense classes they will take this week. Where this installment was mostly verbal, the next three will involve physical activity. No weapons are used — just hands and legs; strikes and kicks.
Samantha Rios, an 18-year-old UF fresh-
man from Rogersville, Tennessee, said she signed up for the self-defense class Friday after hearing about the third assault, which occurred that morning near Library West.
“I come from a small town,” Rios said. 
“I’m not used to this kind of thing.”
But Rios wasn’t alone. Tina Lamb, RAD 
coordinator, said she received hundreds of emails last weekend asking to register. 
Has her inbox ever been that full? “No,” Lamb said. “Absolutely not.”Lamb said UPD offers two courses each 
week, and as of Monday night, courses were booked until Oct. 27. 
“Since I’ve been coordinator, the pro-
gram has not ﬁ  lled up this far in advance,” Lamb said. “Although it’s a very negative situation, it’s good whatever happened on 
campus gave them that drive to come.”
■   ■   ■
At UPD dispatch, UF advertising junior 
Amanda Fernandez tracked SNAP requests 
and relayed pick-up locations to drivers.  
Radios beeped and went static as pick-
ups were conﬁ  rmed and requests came in. 
In front of her, two iPad screens moni-
tored the requests, prioritizing and pinpoint-ing them over a campus map. At about 9:30 p.m. Monday, the maps were full of blink-ing icons — each one representing a student who needed a safe ride. 
At that time, the wait was 10 minutes.“We’re very busy,” Fernandez said. “Probably equivalent to Friday nights, but worse. And on Friday night we only run four vans.”
On Monday, there were nine vans in ser-
vice, three of which Stump said the depart-ment rented from Enterprise. 
The rides are available from 6:30 p.m. to 
3 a.m. Stump said UPD ofﬁ  cers will provide police escorts to students during and after 
that time. She said the school’s medical am-
nesty still applies, so students who are in-toxicated and under the legal drinking age will not get in trouble if they request a ride from a UPD ofﬁ  cer. 
“We’re trying to be proactive,” said Of-
ﬁ  cer Darren Baxley. “We’re snagging peo-ple walking alone, asking ‘Do you have a ride?’“
Still, as he made his way through campus 
around dusk at the start of his night shift, he counted 83 people walking alone.■   ■   ■
As the night went on, rumors came and 
went through UPD and GPD dispatch. Men who matched the description of the suspect were stopped on the streets, questioned, and subsequently released with alibi.
Stump rode through campus with her air 
conditioning on and her windows down, listening. Fear and humidity sat stagnant in 
the air.
“If somebody’s attacking one student, it’s 
personal,” Stump said. “The bottom line is 
they should be able to walk wherever they want.”
For the next three weeks, all UPD vaca-
tion requests have been canceled. The mea-sures in place Monday are expected to ex-tend for weeks to come.
“This is our top priority,” Stump said. 
“It’s a hard turnaround, but I haven’t heard one complaint from these guys.”

THE FEST 13 will expand onto Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza this year.
The ever-growing alternative music fes-
tival that will host 365 bands over Hallow-
een weekend plans to fence off the plaza to 
be the main stage, hosting big-name bands 
like Descendents, the Menzingers and Less Than Jake.
“Bo Diddley gives us the opportunity to 
have the biggest shows,” said the founder of FEST Tony Weinbender.
Weinbender had been working for three years with the City of Gainesville to make the growth happen, with one obstacle be-ing selling alcohol on city property.
“People are traveling from so far away 
to see these shows,” he said, “we want to make them as comfortable as possible.”
On Saturday and Sunday, the fenced-
off area will include the section of South-east First Avenue across the plaza in front of the Hampton Inn and Suites and the Su-pervisor of Elections buildings.
In addition to fencing that section off, 
organizers of FEST hired additional offi-cers from Gainesville Police and emergen-cy medical technicians.“Our biggest thing is that there is a mu-
tual respect among everyone,” said GPD Lt. Brian Helmerson. “We’ve been work-ing with FEST for four to five years very loosely, and we’re focused on coordinat-ing personnel so we can communicate ap-propriately.”
Maximum capacity for the plaza is still 
not known.
Stump said UPD is expand-
ing its Student Nighttime Aux-
iliary Patrol services in an ef-fort to shorten the amount of time someone has to wait for 
a ride on campus. If rides are 
not available, Stump said her department pledged to offer students police escorts so they do not walk alone.
Several campus organiza-
tions are joining to walk stu-dents to and from their resi-dences on campus, Stump said.
Police patrols will be ex-
panded throughout campus, Stump said. Officers that typi-cally work traffic or other daily responsibilities are being shift-ed to nights. GPD officers will be on campus as well.
Vice President of Student 
Affairs Dave Kratzer said stu-dents should download the TapShield mobile application, which can update friends and roommates with the user’s lo-
cation and call police with the 
click of a button. 
Kratzer strongly recom-
mended students walk in pairs and always remain alert and aware of their surroundings.
“If you see something sus-
picious, please give us a call,” Jones said.
None of the blue light emer-
gency phones were utilized during the on-campus attacks, but students are urged to use them if needed. Even if stu-dents don’t have time to pick up the phone and call UPD, just knocking the phone off the hook will send an alert to UPD. 
UF Student Government de-
clared it Sexual Assault Aware-ness Week on Monday, and a rally was held on the Plaza of the Americas that afternoon.
“We’re coming after you,” 
Stump said of the suspect.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2014

The Florida Prepaid program has reduced the cost of its 
rates after a new state law lowered future costs of attendance at 
state universities in Florida.
For Megan Diaz, a 20-year-old UF education sophomore, 
the program was never an option her family looked into.
“My parents never got Florida Prepaid because it just didn’t 
fit into my parents’ budget,” she said. “But I think now, since they’re dropping the prices, my parents might start it for my little brother.”
The prices of certain Florida Prepaid programs will drop, 
according to a Florida Prepaid College Board press release. 
These changes went into effect after a Florida law passed lowering the future cost of annual attendance. 
Florida Prepaid director of marketing and public relations 
Kristin Lock said the change in prepaid prices took place im-mediately after the legislation passed in late spring.
“This has happened quicker than some of the other changes, 
I would think,” she said. “Eleven state universities accept our plans, and all students, in attending those universities, will benefit from our lowered prices.”
About 600 families in Gainesville have Florida Prepaid plans, Lock said, creating a combined savings of $12 million. 
Cassandra Bees benefits from the Florida Prepaid program 
her grandmother got for her.
“It helps pay for my books,” she said. “So the only thing I 
have to worry about paying is my tuition and housing.”
Among the changes, the prepaid board is also offering a 
new 1-Year Florida University Plan that would allow Florida families to buy one to four years at a university they can afford, according to the Florida Prepaid College Board press release. The minimum price of the new plan starts at $43 a month.
Open enrollment for Florida Prepaid begins Oct. 15 and will 
close on Feb. 28, 2015.
With Florida Prepaid becoming more affordable, students 
like Diaz say the program will help future generations of col-lege students. Students reminded Florida Prepaid reduced cost of program
The event corresponds with Sexual Assault Awareness Week
Stump urged students to walk in groups 
at night and download the university’s 
TapShield app, which contacts UPD at the 
click of a button. 
UPD has also established a rumor con-
trol line, 352-294-2289.
During his message, Yeffet spoke about 
Sexual Assault Awareness Week, which 
started Monday and runs until Friday.“We want to make them (students) 
aware of those resources and that they can utilize them should the issue arise or 
should they need to learn more about the 
issue,” Yeffet said. 
Students in attendance expressed their 
concerns on the repeated assaults. 
“I wanted to come out here to support 
this cause because I feel like we should all come together in solidarity to combat people who are out to victimize innocent students,” said Dashari Kearse, a 20-year-old UF linguistics sophomore. 
On the “No Gator Walks Alone” Face-
book page, students offered to accompany anyone walking home alone at night. 
At the event, Maya Iyyani, a 21-year-
old UF psychology senior, signed a banner 
with her friends in support of the cause.
“I think a short-term goal is being aware 
of your surroundings, using the buddy 
system, telling your friends where you are at all times, using SNAP (Student Night-time Auxiliary Patrol), using the blue light system,” Iyyani said.
Stump and Steinberger both empha-
sized the influence the campus community can have. 
“It’s not one person, one office, one de-
partment’s responsibility when something goes wrong,” Steinberger said. “It’s all of our responsibility.” Alone , from page 1PReSS , from page 1Officers step up shiftsFEST to make its way to Bo Diddley Community Plaza this year“My parents never got Florida Prepaid

Neil Lawrence White had a love 
of cracking logic games, complet-
ing puzzles and caring for his stu-dents.
The retired UF mathematics 
professor died Aug. 11 at North Florida Regional Medical Center from an ongoing illness. He was 69.
A celebration of life event was 
held Sunday at the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History, where White spent his time volunteering during retirement.White’s interest in math and all 
things logical were inspired by a 
high school math teacher. He re-
cieved his bachelor’s degree from Michigan State University and 
Ph.D. from Harvard University. He 
came to UF in 1973 and eventually retired in 2008.  During that time, White served as the math depart-
ment associate chair and taught for 
35 years.
His wife of 47 years, Mary, said 
her husband, who joked that he 
looked like Jeopardy! host, Alex 
Trebek, tried to make math as en-
tertaining as possible for his stu-
dents.“He would of-
ten ask Jeopardy! 
questions to the 
students to make it fun,” she said. 
“He enjoyed 
teaching and he always enjoyed going to work.” 
Krishnaswami Alladi, a UF 
mathematics professor, said White shared his love of math in each of his lectures.
“He was a first-rate mathemati-
cian and someone very dedicated 
to the math department,” Alladi 
said. He also said White consistently 
received rave reviews from his stu-
dents. 
One memory left a lasting im-
pression on Alladi, who said White came into his office to request that 
his raise be given to a younger fac-ulty member.
“He went out of his way to 
help,”  he said.
White lent a helping hand not 
only to faculty, but also to his stu-dents. Alladi said White applied for a grant for minority students in 
the math department.
“He single-handedly applied 
for that grant, and we got it,” Al-ladi said.
Another colleague recalled 
White’s dedication.
“He was a very caring person, 
and he especially cared about his 
students,” said Louis Block, a UF 
mathematics professor.
In his memory, UF’s Depart-

Alachua County residents wishing  to 
oversee improvements to county roads 
should apply to be a part of the Moving 
Alachua County Forward Citizen Over-sight Committee  by Wednesday.
The 11-member committee, consisting 
of seven voting and four alternate mem-
bers, will oversee the Moving Alachua County Forward referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot, which calls for a 1-percent trans-portation sales surtax that will span over eight years.
It aims to improve the quality of the 
transportation system in Alachua County. 
Applications for the City of Gainesville 
Commission appointees are due Tuesday and applications for the County Commis-sion appointees are due Wednesday. 
The tax would fund projects such as 
resurfacing roads, adding new turning lanes and paving new roads in order to al-leviate traffic congestion, according to the Moving Forward website. 
Some of the suggested road improve-
ments include Tower Road, Northwest 43rd Street and Southwest 62nd Boule-vard. 
County residents making the median 
household income can expect a tax in-crease of about $109 annually to account for the 1-percent surtax, according to the 
project website.
“I would pay a 2-percent sales tax in 
order to have Southwest 62nd Boulevard 
expanded and resurfaced,” said PJ Russell, a 23-year-old UF alumnus. “The amount of traffic on that road is always ridicu-lous because it leads to the only mall in Gainesville.” 
After being appointed by the County 
Commission, Alachua County League of Cities and the Board of Directors of the Gainesville Chamber of Commerce,  com-mittee members will be responsible for overseeing the sales tax revenue and en-suring it is spent appropriately.
A committee member just has to be an 
Alachua County resident, said advisory board coordinator Jeremy Clements. 
Applications are on the Board of 
County Commissioners’ website.Applications for road im-

BAGHDAD — Iraq’s parliament 
officially named Haider al-Abadi the 
country’s new prime minister late Mon-day and approved most of his proposed Cabinet amid calls by the Arab League 
for its members to combat the Sunni 
militant group advancing across Iraq.
Lawmakers approved all the can-
didates proposed for the new govern-ment, except for a few posts, namely the defense and interior ministers. Outgoing Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki, former Prime Minister Ayad Al-lawi and former Speaker of Parliament 
Osama al-Nujeifi were given the posts 
of co-vice presidents. 
The U.S. and other countries have 
been pushing for a more representative government that will ease anger among Sunnis, who felt marginalized by al-Maliki’s administration, helping fuel the dramatic sweep by the Islamic State extremist group over much of northern 
and western Iraq since June.Iraqi parliament approvediNterNA tiONAl

ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — Gambia’s Nation-
al Assembly has passed a bill imposing life im-
prisonment for some homosexual acts, officials said Monday, potentially worsening the climate for sexual minorities in a country with one of 
Africa’s most vocal anti-gay leaders.
The bill amending the criminal code was 
passed last month and brings life sentences for 
“aggravated homosexuality,” minority leader Samba Jallow told The Associated Press. That is a charge leveled at repeat offenders and people living with HIV/AIDS.
Jallow said while his National Reconciliation 
Party did not condone homosexuality, he voted against the bill along with one other lawmaker. Homosexual acts were already punishable 
by up to 14 years in prison under a Gambian 
law that was amended in 2005 to apply to wom-
en in addition to men.
A draft seen by The Associated Press con-
tains language identical to a controversial anti-gay bill signed into law in Uganda earlier this year.
In addition to “serial offenders” and people 
living with HIV/AIDS, both pieces of legisla-tion say examples of “aggravated homosexual-
ity” include when the suspect engages in ho-
mosexual acts with someone who is under 18, disabled or has been drugged. The term also ap-plies when the suspect is the parent or guardian of the other person or is “in authority over” him or her.Gambia lawmakers pass bill to

medical marijuana legalization?Today’s question: Have you considered taking extra 
safety precautions, like taking self-defense classes or buying pepper spray?Open the Internet: Support net neutrality
The Internet is a powerful tool of democracy that pro-
vides diverse groups of people with an open and equal platform to communicate, share information and ex-
press their views. Net neutrality, a concept that has come under ﬁ  re in recent years, is the principle protecting these 
essential aspects of the Internet.
Net neutrality is the simple idea that all data on the In-
ternet should be treated equally. In practice, this means ev-
eryone on the Internet should be able to easily communicate with one another and access content without discrimination or interference from a third party. All websites should run at the same speed regardless of whether they are owned by individuals, small startups or powerful corporations. This is what is commonly referred to as an “open Internet.”
The concept of an open Internet has come under attack 
due to the Federal Communications Commission’s new pro-posals. Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, has expressed support for Internet service providers (ISPs) offering “paid prioritization” services.
Under this rule, companies like Comcast and Verizon 
would be able to charge extra fees for preferential treatment. The sites that can afford the cost will receive high-speed, pri-ority Internet bandwidth. Those who can’t will essentially 
be relegated to a separate, slower Internet, placing them at a 
severe competitive disadvantage.
Wheeler has promised that the proposal will not threaten 
the openness of the Internet because the FCC will ensure pri-oritization practices are “commercially reasonable.”
Unfortunately, it is difﬁ  cult to believe that Wheeler, a 
former lobbyist for the telecommunication companies that stand to reap immense proﬁ  ts from his proposal, has Ameri-can consumers’ best interests at heart.
It is also difﬁ  cult to believe that the FCC has the ability or 
desire to ensure “commercially reasonable” practices. If it did choose to exercise this power, American consumers would likely have a much faster and more affordable Internet. Even though American consumers pay among the highest rates in the developed world for the Internet, the U.S. ranks only 31st globally in download speeds and 42nd in upload speeds.
The reason for these exorbitant Internet rates is simple. ISPs generally hold a monopoly or duopoly in most regions in the U.S. In fact, 67 percent of Ameri-cans have two or fewer providers from which to choose. Knowing 
that consumers have nowhere else 
to turn, these companies can con-tinue to increase their prices. It’s difﬁ  cult to argue that the current practices of Internet companies are “commercially reasonable.”
Critics of the paid prioritiza-
tion proposal, including prominent ﬁ  rms like Google, Netf-lix and Amazon, rightfully argue that the changes will grant 
ISPs even more control over the Internet.
This is why preserving net neutrality is so important.  Un-
der the FCC’s proposal, instead of acting as an equal platform 
for all sites, the Internet will be split into ﬁ  rst- and second-class speeds for the beneﬁ  t of proﬁ  t-hungry ISPs. Without net neutrality, the free ﬂ  ow of information will be crippled; the very nature of the Internet will be undermined.
On Wednesday, several major companies will be partici-
pating in a symbolic protest to show their support for net 
neutrality. Reddit, Vimeo, WordPress, Foursquare and Kick-
starter are just some of the sites that will display perpetual loading icons. The purpose of this protest is to demonstrate what will happen to the web under proposals currently be-ing considered by the FCC.
Though Internet Slowdown Day, as the involved par-
ties have titled it, will not actually result in slower Internet service, it is an important symbolic act. Americans who care about the free and open exchange of ideas must stand up 
against threats to net neutrality.
The FCC is accepting public comments about the issue on 
its website until Monday. If you believe an open Internet is 
critical to modern America, I encourage you to express your support for net neutrality. Our ability to connect, communi-cate and innovate depends on it.

shape the future 
— if they vote
Low voter turnout has been a prominent feature of Ameri-can elections for the last several decades. In the 2012 elec-tion, only about two-thirds of all voters cast ballots.
This ﬁ  gure signiﬁ  cantly trails other developed countries such 
as South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey, each of which had a turnout 
rate of at least 74 percent in their most recent national elections.
One of the demographic groups most responsible for the low 
voter-turnout rate in the U.S. is the youth population, particu-
larly college-age students. Only 41.2 percent of Americans age 18 to 24 voted in the 2012 presidential election.
A new online service, TurboVote, could be an excellent step 
toward establishing greater political relevance for Florida col-lege students. The service, which the Sun Sentinel described as “a ‘one-stop shop’ for registration and information on how and 
where to cast ballots,” is partnering with 39 Florida colleges and 
universities to increase voter registration among their students.
Registering to vote is about more than just fulﬁ  lling a civic 
duty or being a responsible member of society. If politicians know the youth vote will have a major impact on the outcome of elections, they will likely be more attentive and responsive to the issues that affect college-age Americans.
Many political analysts argue that strong support from 
younger generations of Americans played a key role in Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s victories in the 2008 and 2012 elections. 
The more young Americans who register to vote, the more likely that they will play an even greater role in determining the out-comes of future elections.
Voter registration initiatives like TurboVote are even more 
important given the unpredictable, often misguided election policies of the Gov. Rick Scott administration and the Florida Legislature. Scott deserves credit for signing a 2013 law to re-store early voting and expand polling places, even if he was 
simply reversing policies that his fellow Republicans had previ-
ously enacted and that Scott also supported in the past.
However, some of Scott’s election policies have seemingly 
been designed to prevent as many people as possible from voting. His support for repressive voter ID laws, unnecessary attempts at regulating registration groups like the League of Women Voters and illegal attempts to purge thousands of Flor-ida voters from the polls have all made voting in the Sunshine State a more complicated and unpleasant process.
Regardless of mostly baseless concerns about voter fraud, 
voter registration should not be a partisan issue.
Florida’s college students contribute strongly to the state’s 
economy and culture. Most importantly, the youth of Florida deserve the opportunity to inﬂ  uence the decisions and policies that will shape the future of our state and nation for decades to come.
College students deserve a voice in America’s halls of politi-
cal power, but that can only happen if we vote in large enough 
numbers to make it a reality.
If you’re not already registered to vote, visit TurboVote.org,

Removal of University of Illinois pro-
fessor should cause concern
The removal of Steven Salaita, a tenured 
professor at the University of Illinois, for 
his tweets in support of Palestine should 
be of great concern to those who value ac-
ademic freedom at American universities. Salaita had been offered a job as a tenured professor of American Indian studies, and 
his appointment was contingent on ap-
proval by the University of Illinois’s Board of Trustees. The university chancellor, Phyllis Wise, refused to forward Salaita’s appointment to the board.
Chancellor Wise justified her decision 
in a statement, saying, “What we cannot and will not tolerate at the University of Illinois are personal and disrespectful 
words or actions that demean and abuse either viewpoints themselves or those who 
express them.”
Clearly it is a significant threat to aca-
demic freedom if an individual cannot ex-press an opinion that includes criticism of the state of Israel.
This is a dangerous and blatant attempt 
to silence yet another person who stands 
against the state of Israel. The decision sets 
a dangerous precedent where even those in academia are not safe from corporate and political interests.
Professors shouldn’t have to fear los-
ing their jobs or their tenure for simply criticizing the state of Israel or for taking a position on any social justice issue. Steven Salaita deserves our support.

UF political science seniorUF must do more to make campus safe
I remember touring UF my senior year 
of high school and hearing my mom ask the most important question of all: “How 
safe is campus?” We got the speech about 
the three-lock dorm system, the blue lights, Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol and all of the resources that make UF one of the saf-
est places to call home. Now I, along with 
every other student, can only think about taking a self-defense class and buying pep-per spray.
In the past week and a half, UF has let 
the Gator Nation down.  We have allowed four of our sisters, daughters, friends, girl-friends, roommates and classmates to be assaulted. Worst of all, we have failed to 
bring the perpetrator to justice.
Women are told to walk in groups for safety, but two of the victims were not 
alone when they were attacked. We are told 
to utilize SNAP, but the system is time-con-
suming and inefficient. We’re told to down-load the TapShield app and use the blue light system, but what victim will have the mental clarity to unlock her phone, open 
the app and hit the button? I agree with and 
support taking these safety precautions on a daily basis, but UPD and the entire cam-pus administration must immediately do 
more to prevent future attacks.
UF must make the safety of its students 
its highest priority. That means finding the 
criminal who committed these brutal acts and working to end the disturbing trend of 
assault on campus.

As August came to a close, 
so did Coca-Cola’s inef-fectual Share a Coke cam-
paign — the memory of which is sure to fade faster than many sum-
mer tans.
Back in June, Coke began replacing its logo 
with a smattering of popular names, written 
in its iconic text, in an effort to get its product in your hands and, presumably, the hands of your friends as well. The basic assumption be-ing that if one’s name graces the side of the can then he or she is likely to buy it.
While few can deny the beverage’s deli-
cious flavor, there was a hint of desperation to this campaign that left a sour taste. When a company has to resort to gimmicks in or-der for a product to sell, it’s an indication that something has gone very wrong.
Although the Coca-Cola brand remains 
profitable, the company has been dealing with the disappointing sales of its namesake bever-age for some time now.
The Wall Street Journal suggests American 
consumption of Coke has been on the decline for the better part of 15 years, spelling trouble for a company that “derives almost 75 percent of its global sales volume from carbonated soft drinks.”
Additionally, the Huffington Post reported 
that on average, each American drank about 54 gallons of soda per year in 1998. By 2013, 
that number dropped to 39 gallons, a decline 
analysts project to continue.
It seems that sugary, carbonated beverages 
are simply not as commonplace as they once were — tastes and opinions are changing.
A 30-percent decrease in consumption in-
dicates a systemic change in the way people perceive soda. It appears the philanthropic ef-forts, like those of First Lady Michelle Obama, 
to increase public awareness of obesity are be-
ginning to pay dividends.
Americans are becoming more conscious 
of their weight and, more importantly, their overall health and are less willing to drink their calories. Caloric intake aside, consumers are also choosing to limit their intake of diet sodas, which contain synthetic sugar substi-tutes.
Whether speaking of calories or chemicals, 
health is the overarching theme, and soda is perceived as being unhealthy. In other words, Coke has a serious image problem.
Given the fact that soda sales continue to 
drop, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola’s nemesis, has been proactively focusing on its snack food division. It may come as a surprise that Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, each offering an im-pressive number of products, are both holdings of PepsiCo.
According to the Washington 
Post, “Carbonated soft drinks 
make up only about a quarter of Pepsi’s U.S. sales, compared to 60 percent at Coke.”
Pepsi is outpacing its competitor in terms 
of adapting to changing demands in the mar-ketplace. Rather than trying to convince con-sumers to purchase products that aren’t sell-ing, Pepsi centers its attention on what is.
Meanwhile at Coca-Cola, in spite of the 
increased sales of the company’s offerings of 
juices, water and sports drinks, it continues 
to pump money into its poorest performer: Coke.
Over the next three years, Coca-Cola will 
spend $3 billion stepping up its advertising, which is pretty unnecessary. If there’s one thing it’s mastered, it’s brand recognition.
Everyone knows that Coke is out there; 
people just don’t want it. Coca-Cola, however, 
is sure the customer can be convinced other-
wise.
The Share a Coke campaign has been re-
introduced to persuade consumers to buy its product. Despite noble efforts, the company reported a 3-percent decline in revenue for the first half of 2014.
Share a Coke? Not so much, and this isn’t 
the first time Coke has had issues. Art senior 
Andy Kirkendall said he remembers the addi-
tion of New Coke being quite a blunder.
For those unfamiliar with this huge flop, 
Kirkendall is referring to the formula change of the classic Coke recipe in the mid-1980s. Consumers were outraged, and the company quickly returned to the original and increased sales.
Some believe the reformulation was just 
a marketing ploy orchestrated by Coca-Cola. Whether New Coke was one big scheme may never be known, but Share a Coke certainly has gimmick written all over it.
Personalized cans shouldn’t be necessary 
for the product to sell. In fact, it should serve as a giant red flag. Rather than attempting to force the customer’s hand, Coca-Cola would be better off letting consumer trends speak for 
themselves and responding accordingly as 
Pepsi has done.
Take a lesson, Coke — your competition 
understands your consumers better than you do.

Shortly after 8:30 Sun-
day night, the entire UF Student Body re-
ceived a series of alerts from University Police, warning them of a battery that had just occurred 
on campus near McCarty Hall.
I remember getting UF Alerts dur-
ing my freshman year and being mildly 
worried by them. 
An armed robbery sounded scary, of 
course, but these incidents usually hap-pened far from campus. I felt safe while on campus, tucked away in my dorm room.
Now, getting a UF Alert sends a jolt 
of fear down my spine — sharp and 
sickening. 
Where on campus did the assault oc-
cur? How many lucky buildings away 
from me is an unlucky girl talking to the 
police? Am I safe where I am now? Am 
I secure?
In the past two weeks, four separate 
battery and attempted sexual assaults of 
female UF students were reported. Each 
time, the incidents have occurred on or extremely close to campus. And each time, I feel a renewed mixture of anxiety 
and anger.
The question “I’m scared to walk 
alone now; will you walk home with 
me?” no longer seems like a paranoid precaution. 
Some assaults have occurred fright-
eningly early in the evening, and I feel suddenly limited and at risk even dur-ing the daylight hours.
Females at UF are scared, and with 
good reason. We run to buy convenient travel-size tubes of mace and pepper spray. We walk from class to class with our keys clutched like knives between 
our fingers.
When I mentioned my fears to a male 
acquaintance, I was met with polite con-
fusion. He hadn’t paid attention to the alerts. He didn’t understand my outrage 
and horror. 
I realized that as a privileged, white 
male, the issues of rape and sexual as-sault are hardly concerns for him.
In contrast, the fear of being a victim 
of one of these horrific acts is something 
I have been afraid of for my entire life.By now, we’ve all heard 
the laundry list of precau-tions women must take be-
fore they leave their homes. 
Don’t walk alone at night. 
Don’t provoke men into attacking you. 
Don’t wear too short a skirt. Don’t re-
spond negatively to street harassment. 
Don’t endanger yourself. Every girl has 
heard it before.
From drug-detecting nail polish to the 
email sent out with cheerfully suggested campus safety tips, I’ve been carefully informed of the “don’ts” of avoiding as-sault since I turned 12 years old.
My question is, what is being done 
to stop these horrible attacks from hap-
pening in the future? What is being done 
to catch the man (or men) who attacked these women? How serious is the inves-tigation taking place? Finally, why is 
there more social pressure on a woman 
to protect herself than there is on a man to not attack in the first place?
The UF community — and Ameri-
can society in general —- needs to real-ize that it is far more important to stop someone from becoming a victim than to instruct women on avoiding assault 
after it has occurred. More needs to be 
done to stop these attacks of battery.
Women, especially college-age wom-
en, live in a culture of fear that I find de-spicable. 
Considering that statistically, 1 in 4 of 
us will be sexually violated during our time at college, it is clear that this prob-lem is getting out of control.
All people are supposed to have the 
right to be secure. We have the right to demand respect toward our bodies and our minds. We have the right to walk alone on campus at night and not live in 
constant fear of assault.
The most saddening thing about the 
UF Alerts popping up on my phone is 
that I know for every assault and bat-tery reported, there are so many more 
that will never come to light. It’s time to 
bring an end to this dangerous pattern of sexual assault on college campuses. 
It’s time for a change.

CORAL GABLES, Fla. — University of 
Miami President Donna Shalala plans to step 
down in 2015, ending a tenure in which she raised the school’s profile while guiding the athletic department through a controversial 
move to the Atlantic Coast Conference and a 
scandal involving a rogue former booster.
Shalala, 73, told the school’s board of trust-
ees of her decision Monday. She took over at Miami in 2001 after serving eight years as Health and Human Services Secretary under President Bill Clinton, with whom she remains close.
“A long time ago a friend advised me to al-
ways leave a job when you still love it,” Shalala wrote in a letter to the university community. 
“That is certainly the case here,” she con-
tinued.
Shalala’s wanted to make Miami “the next 
great American university” and succeeded in raising the school’s profile. 
Miami is now consistently ranked among the nation’s top 50 colleges and universities. The school’s first “Momentum” fundraising campaign under her watch raised $1.4 billion, and the second such drive is on the way to its 
goal of another $1.6 billion.
The school’s next fiscal year begins June 1. 
A new president could be in place by then.
“The trustees have my deepest gratitude for their courage in letting me take the univer-
sity on a journey of excellence that was prom-ising, but risky,” Shalala wrote. “It is so easy to stand still.”
Miami will now recruit her replacement.Shalala was wildly popular among stu-
dents, hosted freshmen for a picnic at her home each year and was routinely accessible.
“She had a big impact,” Miami running 
back Duke Johnson said. “She stayed with us. She’s seen us through the things we went through the last couple of years.”University of Miami President Shalala to retire next yearHANNAH HELMS

UF students are cashing in with a Twitter- 
based scavenger hunt. 
A Twitter account, @CampusCashUF, 
is sending students on a wild goose chase 
around campus to find hidden money. 
For Michael Le, an 18-year-old UF electrical 
engineering freshman, it all started on Aug. 27 when he saw a post on Reddit by an account of the same name.He followed the account and got his first 
clue later that day. Le’s hint was a picture of benches in a building on campus. After search-ing, he ended up at Smathers Library.
That’s where he found a clear tube contain-
ing a $10 bill. 
“I had an adrenaline rush when I found 
it,” Le said. “It wasn’t about the money, it was about just finding it.”
Le said he was the first to make a find. Since 
then, three other students have stumbled upon the hidden treasure.
Jovahn Huertas, a 21-year-old UF journal-
ism senior, and his girlfriend Nicole Price, a 21-year-old UF anthropology senior, found their cash on Sept. 2. Their hint from Twitter was a picture of a white sticker that said “101-3.”
“It was rather vague,” Huertas said. The clues led him and Price to a lamppost 
behind Norman Hall, where they found $10. Huertas and Price then used the money on Taco Bell and Zaxby’s.
Adam Jordan, assistant director of student 
success in the Dean of Students Office, said the account is not affiliated with the university.
When contacted, @CampusCashUF de-
clined to comment. The Twitter handle said 
it plans on “going a little bigger” with the 
amounts of hidden cash. 
The user behind the accounts on Twitter 
and Reddit continues to remain anonymous. 
“So in the interest of making someone’s 
day and everyone’s love of treasure hunts, I am hiding cash on campus,” the Reddit post said. “Find it, and it’s yours.”Mystery Twitter user hides cash around campus, tweets clues

StAte� EU SANCTIONS ARE MORE 
EFFECTIVE THAN COUNTRY’S.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BRUSSELS — On Monday, the 
European Union shied away from 
slapping new economic sanctions on Russia over its actions in east-ern Ukraine. Instead, the 28-nation 
bloc said the punitive measures will 
come into force “in the next few days,” depending on how well the cease-fire agreement is upheld.European Council President Her-
man Van Rompuy said in a state-ment delaying the sanctions would leave time for “an assessment of the implementation of the cease-fire agreement and the peace plan.”
Ukraine, Russia and the Kremlin-
backed separatists agreed Friday to a cease-fire and exchange of prison-
ers. While the truce appeared to hold 
Monday, the agreement seemed fragile over the weekend when oc-casional fighting occurred.
The EU sanctions are expected 
to be coordinated with a new round of U.S. sanctions, 
a Western diplo-mat said.
President Ba-
rack Obama and European leaders have said, due to skepticism about the cease-fire, it 
is imperative to 
move forward with sanctions.

During a UF police man-
hunt Sunday, campus was il-
luminated not in orange and blue, but red and blue. 
More than 60 UF and 
Gainesville police officers pa-trolled campus trying to find the battery suspect, but after setting up a security perimeter that surrounded campus, they were unable to locate the man, 
according to UPD Chief of 
Police Linda Stump in a press conference Monday afternoon.
As tensions run high on 
campus, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sur-vey released Friday showed about 19.3 percent of women in America — or 1 in 5 — have been raped. The survey was conducted in 2011.
About 79 percent of rapes 
were committed before the victim was 25 years old.
GatorWell, an organization 
on campus, aims to prevent sexual violence by offering resources  and risk reduction techniques to students, said 
Rita Lawrence, an interperson-
al violence prevention coordi-nator with the organization.
Women who take these measures can still become vic-tims, Lawrence said.
“In 80 to 90 percent of rapes, 
the attacker is known by the victim,” she said. “That makes this perpetrator unusual.”
She said GatorWell is focus-
ing on bystander intervention and training individuals to recognize what could become a dangerous situation.
The Sexual Trauma/Inter-
personal Violence Education (STRIVE) program on campus is a resource the Counseling and Wellness Center is pro-moting to educate students on sexual violence. 
“We have to change the 
culture from one where people unthinkingly accept inequality 
and hurtful behaviors directed 
towards people seen as less powerful to one where more people value respect, equality and power-sharing,” Lawrence wrote in an email. 
The CWC offers walk-in 
consultations and after-hours phone counseling, said Jenni-fer Stuart, a UF psychologist. Support groups are available Thursday afternoons. 
Steven Huston, an account-
ing senior, said he is concerned for his female friends on cam-pus at night. The 21-year-old plans to walk his friends any-where they need to go.

A Gainesville couple’s donation could 
help UF reach top tier status 
Stephen and Carol Shey, founders of 
Shey Associates, a property management 
and development company, are donating 
their home and 657 acres of conservation 
land to the university.
The 12,000-square-foot home and prop-
erty located near the intersection of Mill-hopper Road and County Road 241, will be used as a UF retreat center for visiting academics.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the 
Sheys’ contribution will help UF reach the 
level of preeminence that the university is working toward.
“What’s important about this is that it 
gives UF something that many, if not most, 
highly ranked universities already have,” he said. “That’s a world class conference center like this one.”
Michael Laing, a 19-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology junior, said the center is a generous contribution 
to UF. 
“That definitely offers a great opportu-
nity for people to bring in new speakers, 
and I hope they do utilize that,” he said.The Sheys will continue to live at the 
property and take care of it while it is used as a conference center for an undetermined period of time. 
The couple plans to donate artwork to 
the university’s Harn Museum of Art. 
“We and our family look forward to 
taking this next journey in assisting the University of Florida and Alachua Coun-
ty in creating a home away from campus 
for the eventual pleasure and educational benefit of others,” the Sheys said in a UF press release.Gainesville couple donates home, conservation land to UF

� POLICE SAY HE STOLE 
FROM BOCA FIESTA.

An alcohol inventory at 
Boca Fiesta led to the arrest of a 
Gainesville man who police said stole 10 bottles of liquor from the restaurant and bar Sunday.
Boca Fiesta, located at 232 
SE First St., realized it was miss-ing $390 worth of tequila and Grand Marnier. The restau-rant reviewed its video footage Sunday, which revealed that Carl Rasson 
Harrison, 44, 
jumped the 
back fence and broke into the busi-ness through a poorly se-cured back door, accord-
ing to Gainesville Police officer 
Ben Tobias. 
The video surveillance was 
then turned over to GPD. 
At about 8 p.m. Sunday, GPD 
received video footage and im-
ages of the suspect. Around 2:30 
a.m. Monday, Officers Travis 
Williams and Jeff Bailey locat-ed the suspect on North Main Street, but lost sight of him.  
Shortly after, the officers 
notified Officer Hardman, who found Harrison behind the nightclub University Club. Harrison was wearing the same clothing that was seen in the video. 
At the time of the burglary, 
Harrison was the only one in 
the building. 
After being read his Miranda 
rights, Harrison said he did not 
want to speak about the inci-
dent and wanted to be taken to 
the jail. 
Harrison was charged with 
grand theft.Man charged with tequila theft

COJIMAR, Cuba — Ernest Heming-
way’s love of the sea and eye for detail 
have scientists hoping that a visit to Cuba 
by the author’s grandsons will open access 
to his fishing logs, which may be a trea-sure trove of information about the state of deep-water species before they were di-
minished by overfishing.
Patrick and John Hemingway launched 
a five-day mission to the island Monday 
intent on helping to improve U.S.-Cuba ties and gaining permission for research-
ers to study the aging documents.
Traveling with a team of U.S. marine scientists, the two men sailed a massive 
white sport-fishing yacht to the seaside village that inspired their grandfather’s 
Pulitzer-winning “The Old Man and the 
Sea.”
Scientists are optimistic the trip could 
allow them to review Hemingway’s fish-ing logs, which could help them piece 
together details about the Florida Straits’ 
deep-sea fish populations over the last 75 years. Such information could improve the protect the species that sustain Cojimar.
Researchers gathered little data in the 
years before industrial fishing devastated populations of tuna and other highly de-sired species in the second half of the last century. That leaves sport fishermen’s records—typically containing details of the number of fish caught, the location of 
the catch and weight of the fish—as some 
of the only resources for marine scientists seeking a benchmark to measure popula-tion declines.
One of the earliest and most prolific 
sport fishermen in the Florida Straits, Hemingway lived in Cuba from 1939 to 1960 in a villa on lush, orchard-filled grounds in San Francisco de Paula on the southeast edge of Havana. From Cojimar, he often launched his boat, the Pilar, with 
first mate Gregorio Fuentes, who inspired 
the aging fisherman who battles a giant marlin in “The Old Man and the Sea.”
Scientists hope Hemingway may inad-
vertently have created an unparalleled sci-
entific resource with the logs he kept as he 
prowled some of the world’s richest fish-ing grounds for marlin, sharks and tuna.
“Hemingway was there in Cuba for 20 
years. If he did keep log books for that long, having 20 years—even if it is only for a single vessel—would be very valu-able,” said David Die, a U.S.-based fishery scientist. “It’s exactly the type of informa-
tion that we use nowadays when we assess 
populations of fish in the ocean.” Scientists hope Hemingway journals will provide info on fish

ATLANTA — Chick-fil-A founder and billion-
aire S. Truett Cathy rose from poverty, building a 
restaurant chain that famously closes every Sun-day and drew unwanted attention for the Cathy family’s opposition to gay marriage.
Cathy died early Monday at 93.He opened his first postwar diner in an Atlan-
ta suburb in 1946, and by 1967, he had founded and opened his first Chick-fil-A, Inc. in Atlanta. Over ensuing decades, the chain’s boneless chick-en sandwich he is credited with inventing would propel Chick-fil-A expansion to more than 1,800 outlets in 39 states and the nation’s capital. Ac-cording to the company’s website, by early 2013, 
annual sales topped $5 billion as the chain offered 
up a taste of the South that went beyond chicken to such offerings as sweet tea, biscuits and gravy.
Under the religiously conservative founder, the chain gained prominence for its Bible Belt ob-servance of the Sabbath. None of its hundreds of restaurants are open on Sunday to allow employ-ees a day of rest. Its executives often said the chain 
made as much money in six days as its competi-
tors do in seven.
Those religious views helped win Cathy and 
his family a loyal following from conservative customers, but also invited protests when Cathy’s son defended the company’s donations to groups campaigning against gay marriage.
Cathy’s son, Dan, president of the chain, told 
the Baptist Press in 2012 that the company was 
“guilty as charged” for backing “the biblical defi-
nition of a family.” Gay rights groups and others called for boycotts and kiss-ins at Cathy’s restau-rants. The controversy later subsided.
Cathy is survived by his wife, two sons, a 
daughter, 19 grandchildren and 18 great-grand-children, according to a company statement.Chick-fil-A founder dies at 93Harrison

It did not take Jeff Driskel too long to get into a rhythm 
during Florida’s 65-0 rout against Eastern Michigan on Sat-
urday.
In his ﬁ  rst game under new offensive coordinator Kurt Roper, the redshirt junior quarterback tied his career high for pass completions (22) and attempts (33) after just the ﬁ  rst half.
Driskel ﬁ  nished the game going 31 for 45 with 248 yards 
and a touchdown.
“I think I was very comfortable out there and knew what I was doing,” Driskel said. “We didn’t overcomplicate the game plan, but we executed really well. I think that’s the key to it. When you’re able to reﬁ  ne what you’re doing and do it over and over again, you can be more comfortable with 
what you’re doing.”
The Gators managed to run 86 plays against the Eagles 
on Saturday, which was about 20 more than Florida aver-
aged in 2013 (66.1).
Despite UF’s increased pace in its season opener, coach 
Will Muschamp said Florida can move even faster.
“I think we can change tempo based on the game situa-
tion and how we want to go about things,” Muschamp said. “That’s never really presented itself. We felt pretty comfort-able in the rhythm we were in. There was a little uncertainty 
of what they were going to be in defensively on what we do, 
so that’s why (offensive coordinator) Kurt (Roper) wanted to take a little slower approach, be on the line and see what they do, identify that.”
Offensive line shifting: With starting left tackle D.J. 
Humphries out for at least two weeks, Chaz Green will start at left tackle while Rod Johnson will start in Green’s place at right tackle.
“(Johnson) played extremely well early on in the game,” 
Muschamp said. “Obviously, there was some anxiety in your ﬁ  rst time playing in those situations. But as the game wore on, we thought he played very well. Climbed on the second level and the run game. Did a nice job of doing some of those things, really settled down as far as protection was concerned.”
Muschamp also said that true freshman David Sharpe 
— who replaced Humphries during the Eastern Michigan game — will also receive playing time at both tackle posi-tions during Florida’s game against Kentucky on Saturday.

� THE CORNERBACK IS IN THE NFL SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM.
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer@RajUF
Former Gators cornerback Loucheiz 
Purifoy pleaded no contest to a ﬁ  rst de-
gree misdemeanor marijuana posses-sion of no more than 20 grams — a ﬁ  rst degree misdemeanor — on Thursday after initially being arrested for a felony for marijuana possession earlier this year. Purifoy accepts punishment that includes no jail time and no trial. 
He will need to pay $1,000 in ﬁ  nes 
and $291 to the Alachua County Clerk of Court by Dec. 1. 
Purifoy will not serve probation, and 
under judge Walter Green’s decision to withhold adjudication, he will not be formally convicted of any criminal of-fenses as long as he pays what he owes.
With the legal fallout behind him, 
Purifoy now faces a different form of punishment from the NFL.
“He is in the NFL substance abuse 
program, which is much more exacting and much more comprehensive than Purifoy pleads no contest 
to marijuana possessionCOLUMN
When I woke up on Monday morning, 
I watched new elevator footage of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray 
Rice striking and knocking out his then ﬁ  ancé Janay Palmer with his left hand, released by TMZ Sports.
This video of Rice and Palmer was recorded 
in February, following which both were arrest-
ed, charged and dismissed from jail for assault. Palmer’s charges were later dropped.
Outrage on social media and multiple na-
tional television outlets from the video of Rice hitting Palmer ensued Monday — when TMZ released an almost four-minute long video of the altercation. 
The Ravens terminated Rice’s contract that 
afternoon and the NFL suspended him indeﬁ  -nitely.
February. 
The ﬁ  rst video of the result of this punch 
was released in February — seven months 
ago.
Let’s map out this case’s timeline and iden-tify exactly where  the failures took place. 
There are failures 
to found on a variety 
of different levels 
within the different players that had a role in this case. 
On May 1, Rice 
pleaded not guilty to 
aggravated assault and applied for a program for ﬁ  rst-time offenders that could clear him of charges in as little as one year. 
Rice was accepted into the program and 
avoided trial.
Failure No. 1 is found here. ESPN’s Jane 
McManus reported Monday morning that law enforcement had access to any and all video evidence — including the one released on Monday of Rice striking Palmer — and pro-ceeded to allow Rice to avoid trial since he was Ray Rice case handled wrongly

a ﬁ  rst-time offender.
Failure No. 2 occurred on May 
23, when the Ravens held a press 
conference with Rice and Palmer — who at this point were married — in 
which Rice apologized for “the situ-
ation my wife and I were in”.
The presser got even more repul-
sive as a shaking Palmer spoke into the microphone and apologized for “her role” in the incident.
I don’t care how hard a woman 
slaps you — it did appear Palmer slapped Rice in the video before his 
strike — you cannot, under any cir-
cumstances, hit back as a man.
The Ravens thought it would 
be a bright idea to live tweet this presser. 
This tweet was posted from its 
ofﬁ  cial twitter account: “Janay Rice says she deeply regrets the role that she played in the night of the inci-
dent.”
What message is Baltimore try-
ing to send to women — women like 
myself — that if a man strikes me, I am partially to blame? That Palmer had to take some responsibility for getting knocked unconscious by her then-ﬁ  ance?
Failure No. 3 came on July 24, 
as NFL commissioner Roger Good-ell announced that Rice would be suspended for — wait for it — two regular season games. 
Two games. Rice would be allowed to partici-
pate in Baltimore’s training camp and preseason entirely.
Even through preseason, there 
was a story that ran on the Ravens’ ofﬁ  cial website that contained the lede: “If you had asked me on Feb. 1 
to name ﬁ  ve Ravens players I would 
never expect to receive a call at 3:00 in the morning about doing some-thing illegal, Ray Rice would be on the list – EASILY.” Disgusting. That story’s page has been deleted from the Ravens’ website, but it remained up before Rice’s contract was termi-nated.
The next failure came when the 
NFL, after public outrage over the measly two-game punishment, an-nounced a new domestic violence policy, including harsher punish-ments.
Again: after the fact. And if you thought that was bad, 
consider the fact that the NFL didn’t even have a domestic abuse policy in place beforehand. 
So domestic violence up to this 
point has been basically swept un-der the rug by the league until now.
Finally, the last failure came 
when the Ravens waited again — seven whole months to terminate Rice’s contract.
To the investigators of Rice’s case, and to the Baltimore Ravens: You saw the video of him dragging 
an unresponsive Palmer by her 
arms out of the elevator. 
What else were you expecting it 
to look like when she was knocked out? A softer, less violent action of some kind?
Rice receiving no jail time for 
these actions is sickening. 
The fact that the Ravens failed to 
take matters into their own hands after no jail time was handed down is even worse.
Sunday evening, I received a UF 
Alert of a battery that occurred on campus, the fourth attack targeting women in just nine days.  
The events have even made na-
tional news.
According to the Partnership 
Against Domestic Violence, a wom-an is battered every nine seconds. 
How many national headlining 
stories directly dealing with this degrading, horriﬁ  c and repulsive issue, like the one we’ve seen with Rice, is it going to take for that num-ber to be drastically lowered? To 
become zero?
As a society, we have to do bet-
ter. 
It starts with giving no exception 
to violence against women, or vio-
lence of any kind for that matter. 
In order for us to even begin do-
ing that, we can’t wait until after the fact to get it right. 
We must hold ourselves to a 
higher moral standard, and give punishment when it’s due. 
This won’t eradicate the problem 
immediately, but perhaps it’ll spare a few women from violence in the process.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2014

Football finally returned for cur-
rent and former Gators this past 
weekend. With Week 1 of the 2014 
NFL season along with the first of-
ficial and complete University of Florida football game of 2014 in the books, it’s time to review how UF 
football grads are doing in the pros.
Power of three: A different 
set of three Gators made power-
ful contributions in Sunday af-ternoon’s Cincinnati Bengals vs 
Baltimore Ravens game.
As for the Bengals, UF alum 
Carlos Dunlap had three tackles 
and one sack, while fellow Gator 
Reggie Nelson’s 10 tackles—sev-
en of which were solo—contribut-ed to a strong Cincinnati defense that held the Ravens to only 16 points. The Bengals’ offense put 
up 23 points for the win.
Matt Elam three tackles and 
one defended pass was not 
enough to secure the Ravens a 
win, in what would turn out to 
be a not-so-great start to the sea-son on and off the field for Bal-timore. 
Fellow Florida grad and team-
mate Will Hill remains on the reserve-suspended list, where he will remain for the next five weeks as punishment for repeat-
edly violating the NFL’s sub-
stance abuse policy. Former Gator wide receiver Deonte Thompson did not record any statistics for the Ravens.
Sturgis, Jenkins make impact 
for ‘Fins: Many former Gators had a hand in the most surpris-ing game of the week. The Miami Dolphins defeated the New Eng-land Patriots 33-20 at Sun Life 
Stadium on Sunday afternoon. 
Five former Gators took to the 
field in Miami Gardens, Fla.—four for the Dolphins and one for 
the Patriots.
Jelani Jenkins had six tack-
les for the Dolphins in Sunday’s game—five of which were solo tackles. Caleb Sturgis went 4-for-4 on field goals with a long of 38 
yards. The second year NFL vet-
eran made all three extra points for the Dolphins. Among the former Gators and 
current Dolphins who did not 
compete Sunday were Mike Gil-
lislee (injured reserve, hamstring) and Mike Pouncey (offseason hip surgery). Pouncey is expected to miss eight weeks while Gillislee’s 
season is over before it could be-
gin. 
On the other side of the field, former Gator Dominique Easley made one tackle for the Patriots 
in his regular season debut. 
The first round draft pick also 
committed a neutral-zone infrac-
tion, which put New England back five yards to the 26-yard 
line with seven minutes left in 
the second quarter. 
Success in Seattle: Percy Har-
vin was arguably the most suc-
cessful Gator in the NFL this past 
week. 
In the first NFL regular season 
game, Harvin totaled 160 all-pur-pose yards for the reigning cham-
pion Seattle Seahawks, whom 
defeated the Green Bay Packers 36-16 Thursday night. 
Harvin started off his second 
year with the Seahawks strong, 
catching seven balls for 59 yards, 
returning three kicks for 60 yards and rushing four times for 41 yards.
“We had a ton of different 
ways to show how we’re fitting him into our offense,” said Pete Carroll, Seahawks coach after Thursday’s game. “It’s what 
we’ve been hoping for. There’s a 
bunch of other stuff that we’ll do. We’re just getting started.”
Closer to home: Former 
Gator Jeff Demps remains on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ practice squad. UF alum Solomon Patton returned two kicks for 52 yards 
and four punts for 56 yards in his 
NFL debut. EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
For coach Mary Wise, it all comes down 
to the grit and the grind.
In a weekend filled with difficult match-
ups, the Gators faced their toughest chal-
lenge yet — squaring off with two top-10 ranked teams within two days of each match.
In the grand scheme of the schedule, 
Wise wasn’t focused on the outcome, but the resilience her team showed.
“When we sched-
uled last week’s 
matches on the 
Thursday-Saturday 
note, we knew it was going to be quite the challenge for our team playing at Florida 
State on Thursday night and Texas on Satur-
day,” Wise said. 
“If we just look at the outcome, then I 
think we’re missing the point as a team. ... To go five with Florida State at Florida State, it 
says a whole lot about the grit of the team.”
And senior defensive specialist Holly 
Pole has shown the grit Wise is looking for 
in her team. Pole relieved senior Taylor Un-
roe from the libero position against Okla-
homa in Florida’s season-opening weekend — a sign of the depth that Wise continues to talk about.
After putting on the libero jersey for her 
second game of the season, Pole finished the night against Florida State with eight digs in five sets, just one dig behind junior setter 
Mackenzie Dagostino.
A little more than two days after Florida’s 
loss at Florida State, Pole improved from her 
five-set showdown with the Seminoles and 
led Florida with 11 digs in four sets against 
third-ranked Texas.
“She is our best defender, both in terms of 
her volleyball IQ and the plays she makes,” Wise said. 
“Our faith is that if you’re going to take 
your big time swing and we could choose one player in the back row to dig that, it would be Holly. ...She provides a stability 
for us that the team really recognizes and 
benefits from.”
Playing in the libero position isn’t new to 
Pole. 
The Ocala native, as well as senior Mad-
die Monserez, have been practicing in the position alongside Unroe so the Florida team could add depth to its defensive spe-cialists. 
Wise said having the versatility to rotate 
among Monserez, Pole and Unroe is benefi-cial when players are struggling to connect with their teammates.
“When Mary made that change against 
Oklahoma -- I mean there were nerves defi-nitely coming out in the libero jersey, but it’s the same thing,” Pole said. 
“I’m still digging, passing and serving — 
those are my three main responsibilities and that doesn’t change, it’s just being out there for an extra two and a half rotations.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

With the defense already establish-
ing an identity this season, Florida’s 
offense is now balancing the team.
The offense has registered at least 
two goals in each of the Gators’ four 
wins this season.
A total of eight different play-
ers have contributed a goal thus far, 
making Florida a multi-dimensional threat to opponents.
“I think for us it’s mostly about 
how we combine well as a team,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “When you look at the goals we scored 
against FSU, we showed some pa-
tience, we showed some concentra-tion in terms of the balls we were playing to each other and the ability to play to execute that. For us it’s just continuing to develop relationships between players.”
Pamela Begic has been a part of 
that offensive scheme.
The sophomore midfielder was 
named the Southeastern Conference Offensive Soccer Player of the Week on Monday after she had a goal and an assist over the weekend.
Begic is the second Gator to receive 
an honor this season, joining forward Jillian Graff who received the first award on Aug. 25.
The Slovenian native’s goal from 
eight yards out snapped a 226-min-ute scoreless drought versus Florida State that Florida was held to since 
the 2012 matchup.
She also distributed the ball to 
teammate Betsy Middleton for a goal 
to secure the victory over FSU. Begic has now totaled one goal and two as-sists on the season.
But what’s more impressive of the 
offense is the ability to both establish the tempo early in games by taking 
leads and close the game out in the 
second half.
“In our training we do a lot of 
what we call situational plays,” Bur-leigh said. “Playing, leading 1-0 late in the game, trailing 1-0, things like that so our players get some reps in what that feels like, but it’s never the same as replicating what happens in 
a real game.”
Burleigh added that when Florida 
is not chasing a game, she believes the 
team has more patience. When they are down a goal, the Gators become impatient and rush passes.
Florida has only been in that situ-
ation once this season when they trailed Oklahoma 2-0, which dis-played why the team became impa-tient and resulted in a loss.
Besides that mishap, Florida has 
recorded 12 goals in five games played and has averaged 2.4 goals 
per game. That is just 0.2 less than last 
season through five matches.
What can be more impressive is if 
they can tally multiple goals against another ranked opponent in Stan-ford.
The next match will mark the sev-
enth time in the program’s 20-year history that the Gators will face a top-
10 team in consecutive matches.
Fourth-ranked Stanford hasn’t al-
lowed a goal this season, which cre-
ates a bigger challenge for Florida’s offense this week.
“This Stanford trip kind of came up 
late in the scheduling process. It was a late addition, and we just couldn’t pass it by because the opportunity to 
play them, they’re consistently good 
every year,” Burleigh said. “To be in this environment, to play Stanford on the road, is great for us for the future of this season. In the big picture for us, the more exposure we can have with different types of styles and dif-ferent types of teams the better.”Sophomore midfielder earns SEC honor

Pamela Begic dribbles the ball downfield during UF’s 2-0 
win against USF on Aug. 24 at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
Purifoy was not selected during 2014 NFL Draft in May
anything he would ever be required to com-
plete here in Florida,” Purifoy’s defense at-torney Stephen Stanfield told alligatorSports Monday. “Frankly, I would love if indigent defendants had the opportunity to participate in such a program. It’s so comprehensive, it’s 
what we would want as a society.”
Stanfield highlighted Purifoy’s draft day 
slide from third-round projection to undraft-
ed free agent status — and the forfeiture of “hundreds of thousands of dollars” that came with it. Stanfield said Purifoy was 
flown to a different city “ev-
ery weekend” leading up the 
NFL season when he would 
rather be enjoying himself in 
a new city.
Stanfield declined to discuss any further 
specifics about what Purifoy went through 
with the NFL, citing attorney-client privi-
