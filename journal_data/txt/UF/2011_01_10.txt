Flames danced in the hands 
of mourners who filled the Reitz 
Union Amphitheater on Saturday 
night for a candlelight vigil in honor of 21-year-old Saleha Huu-da, a UF student who was found dead Dec. 30. 
The event was coordinated by 
the UF Center for Student Activi-ties and Involvement and a num-ber of groups Huuda participated 
in, including the UF Competitive 
Cheerleading squad and the Afri-can Student Union. 
“It was an amazing expe-
rience,” said Simona Days, a 
21-year-old Santa Fe College 
student who knew Huuda for 11 years and was one of at least 200 people in attendance. “It just re-
minded me of what a good friend 
she was, and it’s amazing to know she touched so many lives.”
Huuda’s friends and family 
stood behind a lectern at the front 
of the amphitheater, recounting their memories and sometimes tearfully sharing stories about 
Huuda. 
“She was loved and she was 
most definitely cared for,” said 
Danielle Agyemang, one of Huu-
da’s cousins who spoke at the event. “Our memories will most definitely live on in our hearts.” 
Huuda’s immediate family 
was represented at the event by 
Dr. James Es-
segbey, a UF lin-guistics profes-
sor who said the 
family was very 
a p p r e c i a t i v e 
of the support 
it has received from the com-
munity. 
Katilia Hall, who worked 
closely with Huuda during their time at Fort Clarke Middle School’s Teen Zone after-school program from 2008 through 2009, recounted the day when Huuda found out Hall had no daugh-
ters. Huuda offered to be a daugh-
ter to her that day, and from 
then on would refer to Hall as “mama.” 
“I thought of her as my beau-tiful butterfly,” Hall said. “And now she’s flying away beauti-fully.” 
As a counter to the event’s 
somber tone, an African drum circle formed following its com-pletion, and those who attended 
were asked to partake in one of 
Huuda’s favorite activities — 
Judge strikes down state ban on public profanity in North Carolina
RALEIGH, N.C. — A North Carolina 
judge has struck down a 98-year-old state 
ban on public profanity.
Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour 
dismissed a misdemeanor charge against Chapel Hill resident Samantha Elabanjo on Wednesday. She had been convicted in July of using the word “damn” during a confrontation with police officers.
Baddour ruled the law against indecent 
or profane language within earshot of two or more people on any public road in North Carolina was unconstitutionally vague.
The case started Feb. 15 when Elabanjo 
stepped into the road as a police cruiser drove by. The two officers asked her to get back on the sidewalk. She did, but said: “You need to clean up your damn, dirty car” while still in the road. She then called the officers a vulgar name and she was ar -
rested.

For a team of filmmakers, Jon 
Bougher and Roman Safiullin have 
taken on a number of roles in the past year. 
They have gone from being two 
Americans trapped in a foreign coun-try during a monstrous earthquake to the hot-ticket item on all the news net-works to two graduate students who were thrust into an academic limbo laden with thorny technicalities.
But on Tuesday, they hope to as-
sume the role of message-bearers as they present their documentary film, 
“Bound by Haiti” in the Reitz Union 
Auditorium at 7 p.m.The film, which focuses on two 
activists working in Haiti to establish orphanages and schools, features foot-age taken during and after the Jan. 12 
earthquake that ripped through the 
Caribbean nation last year.   
For Bougher, the screening carries a 
great significance given his ties to the 
university and the timing of the event—a day be-fore the anniver -
sary of the earth-
quake. 
“This whole year,” Bougher said, 
“has been a wild ride.”

If you’re reading this in your dorm, you 
may want to pack up and head outside.
All dorms are scheduled for mandatory 
fire drills and fire safety checks this week, re-
quiring students to evacuate their dorms for 
up to two hours. During that time, resident 
assistants will be searching rooms to make sure students are out.
Students found in their dorms during the 
drill will be required to attend a two-day fire 
safety course, said Alberto Rapaport, an RA 
for Keys Complex, building 3.
Fire drills — and the separate safety 
checks — will be at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. starting today and ending Jan. 19.  Rapaport said students were notified 
of the drills via e-mail, floor meetings and 
signs in dorm hallways.He specified that RAs will not be search-
ing through students’ desks, dressers or book bags.
“We can not legally search through your 
stuff,” he said.
Steven Sengberg, a 21-year-old senior at 
UF living in Keys, said he is “pretty sure” he knows the fire safety regulations. He said he 
usually goes to his friend’s building to wait 
for the fire drills to finish in his room.
Elissa Hausmann, a 20-year-old junior 
also living in Keys, said she didn’t know the drills were scheduled to start on Monday but 
figured they would be this week since this is her second year in the dorms.Fire drills on tap this week

  Twenty-eight years after his 
ﬁ  rst ﬁ  re, Gene Prince will be trad-
ing ﬂ  ame-resistant jackets and ﬁ  re 
alarms for suits and meetings as Gainesville’s ﬁ  re chief.
  “In whatever I’ve done, I’ve al-
ways wanted to be effective,” he 
said.
  For Prince, a day on the job 
meant extinguishing a ﬂ  aming 
two-story house or treating the 
injured after a 27-vehicle pileup. 
Now, his job will include meeting with City Commissioners to dis-cuss the annual budget.
  “The administrative side of 
things, it can also be physically challenging,” he said. “It’s a differ-ent type of stress.”
  City Hall isn’t foreign to him. 
He worked to pass a ﬁ  re assess-ment fee this summer that charges homeowners a few hundred dol-
lars a year to fund about half of the 
Gainesvill Fire Rescue Department and to cover some of the city gov-ernment’s budget shortfall.
  Jeff Lane, Gainesville Fire Res-
cue district chief, said he expects Prince to do well in his new role because he’s highly respected.
  “If you’re always fair and hon-
est, it really doesn’t matter what side of the table you sit on,” said Lane, who was trained by Prince about 20 years ago. 
  “To sum him up, he’s very fair,” 
he said.
  He said Prince expects a lot out 
of his ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters, but he still has a 
good sense of humor.
  “He doesn’t take himself too seriously,” Lane said. “That’s go-
ing to be very useful during tough budget times.”
  When Prince started, he wasn’t 
passing policy.
  He’s worked his way up 
through the ranks since he was a 
24-year-old in Ocala.
  Almost three decades later, 
Prince said the goal hasn’t changed. 
He’s still there to serve.
  “I can’t say I set out to be ﬁ  re 
chief,” he said. “I love what I do. From the ﬁ  rst time you feel that you helped someone in need, you get that and you’re hooked.”

While no new money is rolling into 
the environmentally focused Wild Spaces 
& Public Places program since its sales surtax ended in December, the remaining funds will still support various projects 
this year. 
The Wild Spaces & Public Places pro-
gram, approved by voters in 2008, was 
funded by a half-cent sales surtax that ended its two-year run on Dec. 31, drop-
ping the county sales tax rate from 6.75 
percent to 6.25 percent. 
It was created to complete several city 
and county projects, including park im-
provements and land conservation efforts 
in the Gainesville area. 
“I think most of us really didn’t miss 
that half-penny.  I would love to see citi-zens say, ‘Yes, I think we should continue 
something like that.’ But I don’t think 
that’ll happen probably until 2012,” said Jack Hughes, executive director of the lo-cal nonprofit Gainesville Sports Commis-
sion.  Alachua County received about 51.75 
percent of the surtax revenue, while the 
City of Gainesville received about 40.39 percent. 
The remaining funds were split among 
the county’s eight other cities, according to a June 2010 WSPP progress report.
During the planning stages of the pro-
gram, the city created a prioritized list of 23 projects it wanted to fund through the sales tax. 
When revenues fell below their original 
estimates, city officials decided to com-plete the top priorities for each project rather than attempt to finish one full proj-ect at a time.
The city government has already start-
ed to build a senior recreation center at Northside Park in cooperation with Ala-chua County. 
It should be completed by the fall, said 
Steven Phillips, director of the City of Gainesville Department of Parks, Recre-ation and Cultural Affairs. 
The city also built a skate park at Pos-
sum Creek Park, in addition to other proj-ects.
“We [had] the seniors, who wouldn’t 
probably be using a skate park, and gave 
them a recreation center,” Phillips said. “I 
think the city was very wise to make sure that everyone who put a vote in there had something to show for it.”4, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2011

Opponents of the U.S. health 
care law scored a victory for their 
cause in mid-December when a Virginia-based federal judge be-came the first to invalidate a sec-tion of the legislation.
Judge Henry E. Hudson ruled 
the condition in the law that re-quires most Americans to acquire their own health insurance was unconstitutional, stating  that the bill oversteps the bounds of the Commerce Clause, which allows Congress limited regulatory au-thority.Mayor Craig Lowe said he was 
not surprised that the ruling posed concerns about the law. 
With any groundbreaking piece 
of legislation, changes, Lowe said, are to be expected.
“As you enter new ground, 
you’re going to find ways that a particular program can be im-proved for the benefit of the coun-try, and I think this is certainly an example of that,” Lowe said.
Fletcher Baldwin Jr., director of 
the Center for International Finan-cial Crimes Studies and professor of law emeritus at UF’s Levin Col-lege of Law, said the law’s fate will ultimately be a matter for the Su-preme Court to decide. 
Baldwin said he expects a 5-4 
Supreme Court decision that will declare the insurance mandate 
unconstitution-
al. He said he doubts the court will declare the entire health care law unconsti-tutional, as that would throw out many previous 
cases decided based on the Com-merce Clause.
Even if the insurance mandate 
is stricken, Baldwin believes much of the law should still be consid -ered constitutional and therefore 
will remain intact.
Ryan Garcia, second vice chair -
man of UF College Republicans, 
hopes the Supreme Court will rule the entire law unconstitutional, although he doesn’t expect a deci-sion anytime soon.
For now, Garcia said he expects 
both sides in the health care battle to “dig in their heels” until the Su-preme Court reviews the law.
“It’s going to be a hard-line bat-
tle until the Supreme Court makes a decision,” he said. 
Derek Reiners, a visiting assis -
tant professor of political science at UF, doesn’t expect a repeal to work because Republicans lack the needed number of representatives in the Senate, but he views it as a 
beginning to the negotiation pro-
cess over the law. 
“I think the future of health 
care in the country isn’t something that’s resolved in a single vote or a single ruling,” he said. 
While the City of Gainesville 
won’t be affected by the health care law’s enactment in terms of the services it provides to citizens, Lowe said the law could help al-leviate financial strains on taxpay-ers as a result of health insurance issues.
“We’re already paying for 
health care for others now — it’s just more expensive to do it [than it might be with health care re-form],” he said.

The makers of Power Balance wrist-
bands, a silicone bracelet that claims to 
improve strength, balance and flexibility, have come out with a statement claiming the product does not support its advertis-
ing claims. 
It was claimed that the wristband works 
with the body’s energy system to result 
in increased mental and physical perfor -
mance. 
Celebrities and athletes including David 
Beckham, Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bry-ant are known wearers of the product and have spread popularity of the product since 
its market debut in 2007.
Around campus, students like Kane 
Smith, a food science sophomore, can be 
spotted wearing the wristband.
“I never had much faith in them to be-gin with anyway,” he said. “One of my close friends wears one and swears by it. I think they make themselves believe the 
bands work — a very good example of the 
placebo effect in my opinion.”
Industrial and systems engineering ju-
nior Kelly Repplier wears her wristband for the look rather than the implied effects.
“I’ve never noticed any difference in 
my abilities while wearing it, and the guy in the mall trying to explain the science behind 
it was a complete joke,” she 
said.
However, some, such as Zachary Field, 
a biology freshman, has noticed differences in his endurance during his runs around 
campus as well as in his balance. 
“Even if it doesn’t do anything physi-
cally, I think it still helps me mentally as a 
constant reminder to push myself harder,” 
he said.  Maker of popular wristbands 
admits claims may be false

Dance Marathon at UF is taking a 
new approach to raising money for the 
Children’s Miracle Network this year.
In previous years, 725 students in-
volved with a campus organization danced 26.2 hours at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. This year, Dance Marathon will open 75 more spots for individual dancers to participate without being affiliated with a campus group. 
“This new approach will ultimately 
raise an extra $15,000,” said Cait Fero-leto, the Dance Marathon public rela-tions chairwoman.“Dance Marathon’s main concern 
for now is to make students aware that they can participate in such an out-
standing event, even if they are not a 
part of an organization,” Feroleto said. 
To participate, individuals must 
sign up and raise $200.

Marion Brechner, a long-time friend and do-
nor to the College of Journalism and Communi-
cations at UF, died Thursday afternoon.
Brechner, 98, and her late husband, Joseph 
Brechner, a pioneer broadcaster, were known 
for advocating freedom of the press.  
John Wright, dean of the College of Journal-
ism and Communications, said Brechner had a major impact on how the college came to be what it is today.
“She meant everything to the college,” 
Wright said.
He said the college’s doctoral program is 
where it is because of her and her husband’s work and beliefs in freedom and democracy. 
“She advanced the cause of open govern-
ment and freedom of information through her generosity,” Wright said.
Brechner and her husband gave more than 
$1 million to fund The Brechner Center for 
Freedom of Information in 1986, renaming the 
previous organization, Florida Freedom of In-formation Clearinghouse.
According to its website, The Brechner Cen-ter “answers queries about media law from journalists, attorneys, and other members of the public.”
She donated $600,000 in 1999 to establish 
what is now known as the Marion B. Brech-ner First Amendment Project. The Project is a nonprofit organization that focuses on current 
and contemporary issues regarding the First 
Amendment.
Brechner continued to give donations to the 
college up until her death to further her belief in freedom 
of information.
Wright described her as a 
wonderful, caring, highly in-
telligent, dynamic, charming 
and insightful woman.
“She’s the kind of person 
you savor every moment with 
her,” he said.

Today’s question:  Are you 
participating in Dance Marathon?
74 TOTAL VOTES76% YES24% NOFriday’s question: Are you ready for Spring Break yet?As a rule of thumb, people don’t have their politi-
cal affiliations carved on their tombstones. Parties don’t matter in the face of tragedy and grief, but 
the memories of the deceased and the pain of the survivors do.
Word that U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords had been shot 
Saturday morning was followed shortly by reports that 
many others were wounded outside the grocery store 
where she was holding an event. Before news outlets could confirm the numbers of dead and wounded, and before they even knew whether Giffords was still alive, a spark ignited in the minds of conspirators and those who 
wanted to turn a crime against democracy into ammuni-
tion in a partisan battle.
“It must have been a right-wing, Tea Party nutjob be-
cause he killed a Democrat,” they began musing.
Then the spark caught and burned its way back to half-
remembered campaign phrases and motifs. 
“Didn’t Sarah Palin use crosshairs and other gun imag-
ery while campaigning? Wasn’t Giffords’ district in one of those crosshairs?”
Yes, she did and it was, but when were metaphors out-
lawed? Palin was building on the image America has of her. She’s known to most as the woman shooting a moose while sitting in a helicopter. Her selection of campaign 
materials doesn’t mean she is responsible for the tragedy 
on Saturday, nor does it mean someone with her views was behind it. 
But political sharks smelled blood in the water, and it 
has sent them into a tizzy of what-ifs and maybes.
However, try as they might to pin this shooting on a 
fanatical conservative, “The Communist Manifesto” sits nestled among the suspect’s favorite books on his MyS-pace page. 
As humans, everyone from police to reporters to every-
day people want a reason for senseless murder. They want someone to blame. They want closure.
As of yet, they don’t have that.Instead of jumping to conclusions or making the deaths 
of six people and injuries of others into a political topic, the country needs to come together and mourn.
This wasn’t a matter of mere partisanship. The gunman 
didn’t stop to ask the party affiliation of the 9-year-old girl 
he killed. Such a terrible action offends nearly everyone on 
the grounds of human decency, regardless of their views on health care or the economy. 
In the coming days, Americans will question the  rea-
soning of the gunman, his motivation and his morals. As 
long as the suspect stays tight-lipped, however, questions 
will remain unanswered. Until he tells the FBI about his thought process, no one can be sure what he was think-ing.
So let’s stop assuming we know. We don’t. All we have are casualties and memories of shots ring-
ing out. We have candlelight vigils outside a Tucson hos-pital. We have a palpable fear that may further disconnect us from our political representatives.
But more than anything else, we have hope that our 
country can overlook all our differences and that the vic-tims and their families can find peace. No blame game
Shooting shouldn’t be 
made political
Now boarding: spring semester classes
Pilot: “Please make sure that your valuables are secured and your seat and dinner tray are in the upright, locked position as we prepare for takeoff.”
I’ve heard that smell is the sense most associated 
with memory. 
It’s something about the way the olfactory and mem-
ory centers of the brain work together to make a strong connection between stored experience and what we 
smelled at the time.
I now believe that.
On Wednesday, the first day of classes, I was quite 
puzzled in class due to a latent smell I couldn’t quite 
identify. 
It was strange, not only because I couldn’t place it, 
but also because it was somehow sublevel to the obvi-
ous array of smells. 
There was something hidden under the usual smells 
of new notebooks, rain and soon-to-be-crushed hopes and dreams that freshmen give off. 
To the possible detriment of my first psychology 
class, I shut my eyes and tried to identify the smell.
I finally realized with some perplexity what the odor 
was and murmured out loud: “Airplane?”
Thinking about it since then, it’s made more and 
more sense to me.
Pilot: “Please make sure that your valuables are secured 
and your seat and dinner tray are in the upright, locked posi-tion as we prepare for takeoff.” 
Prof: “I expect all students to be in their seats when 
it’s time for class. I have no tolerance for tardiness.”Pilot: “Please turn off all cell 
phones and other electronic devices.”
Prof: “If you bring a cell phone 
to an exam and it goes off, you will be ejected from the exam and given a zero.”
Pilot: “Please take note of the emergency exits, and feel free 
to address any of the in-flight crew with safety concerns.”
Prof: “My office hours are Monday and Thursday, 2 
p.m. to 4 p.m.”
So I guess that’s it. I strongly associate the first week of classes with the 
mundane experiences I’ve had waiting for airplanes to take off. 
Waiting for classes to get into real material; waiting 
for a plane to taxi down the runway. 
Maybe the underlying smell of recycled air and mild 
disinfectant is a bad sign. 
Maybe I should take the first week of classes more 
seriously. 
After all, the first week of classes can be a strong sign 
of what a semester will hold. 
Perhaps I can rise above my cynical, slacker nature 
and draw a lot of hopeful prospects about my next four 
months at UF.
Then again, listening to a teaching assistant read the 
syllabus inspires the same behavior that the flight at-
tendants’ flight safety song and dance does: reading the 
paper.

 A letter of modest proposal
  The pro-choice/pro-life di-
chotomy is truly silly. I have grad-
uated from this school of thought into a much more sensible camp: 
pro-abortion. Abortion as birth 
control is a practice of the past; 
abortion as population control 
is what is needed for our society to function in the coming years.
Overpopulation is a problem that 
continues to grow exponentially 
worse. 
  Soon we will not have 
enough land for food growth to 
feed everyone in the world, a
problem which pro-abortion pol-
icies could deter. Forced abor-
tions would of course have to be decided judiciously, the ﬁ  rst tar-
gets obviously being those who 
oppose the policy. 
  From there, targets could be 
chosen based on genetic predis-position. 
  Some call this eugenics; I call 
this effective action for the fu-
ture. 
  A modest proposal, I think, is 
to target those with a low IQ or 
possibly those who have more re-
ligious afﬁ  nity than sensibility. 
  Maybe then, there will be 
fewer people rehashing their de-cades-old pro-life or pro-choice 
arguments to anything with an 
ear.

 5EGLetter to the Editor
  I  have a lot of favorite quotations I’ve read through the years. 
Some are great for inspiration, others provide a laugh and 
others just make me think. But there’s one in particular that 
always, for me at least, seems to rise above the rest in the abun-
dance of potential Facebook-favorite quotations. Margaret Mead, famed anthropologist and author, once said, “Never doubt that 
a small group of thoughtful, concerned citizens can change the 
world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” Well, Gators, the 
late Ms. Mead would be proud of all of us. For we have, indeed, changed civilization. 
  And then there’s poet Maya Angelou. This walking, breathing, 
quoting machine once said, “You may not think you’ll be heard. 
Speak anyway.” Well, Gators, we spoke. And we’ve been heard. 
  During the past six months, we’ve amassed a successful cam-
paign for Meat-Free Mondays in UF’s two dining halls, which was 
no small feat. UF is the largest land-grant college in the southeast-
ern United States, and no one thought we’d be heard. When I ﬁ  rst 
brought this campaign to the forefront early in the fall semester, 
I was told we’d be laughed at. And perhaps we were. Perhaps we’re still being laughed at by a few. But we’ve made change, Gators. We’ve made a change that will positively impact our bod-
ies, our planet, our fellow starving men and women across the 
globe and the 27 billion animals who are unnecessarily slaugh-
tered every year to be put on our plates. And that’s what I call a legacy. 
  We collected a sizable army along the way to work with Gator 
Dining Services in helping our food provider at the nation’s sixth-
largest university become more ethical, sustainable and nutri-
tious. We collected the public support of UF’s very own Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability, GatorWell, Gators for a Sustainable Campus and Animal Activists of Alachua to help Gator Dining Services along 
the way in making this positive change in having a vegetarian 
menu just one day a week in only two dining halls on campus. 
  And we gathered support from the big guns, too. People for 
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Humane Society of the 
United States and the Earth Day Network also sent support to 
Gainesville and offered to help Gator Dining Services make this 
long-lasting positive change for a Meat-Free Monday. But most 
importantly, we collected the support from all of you. 
  Over the course of four days at the end of the fall semester, 
we gathered more than 2,000 petition signatures spanning more than 150 pages from concerned UF students 
and faculty who realize the importance of 
leaving meat off their plates just one day a 
week. And when the United Nations recent-ly identiﬁ  ed factory farming as one of the leading contributors to global warming, it’s 
no surprise so many of you gladly added 
your name to the list of supporters. 
  With Gator Dining Services successfully 
encouraging and advertising for a Meat-Free Monday at Fresh 
Food Company and Gator Corner Dining Center, UF joins the 
list of more than 30 universities across the nation that are choos-
ing to leave ﬂ  esh off the menu on Mondays, including Harvard 
University, Yale University, Columbia University, the University of North Florida, the University of Central Florida and even the University of Mississippi. 
  But we still have a lot of work to do in helping Gator Dining 
Services continue to improve its work in becoming the premier dining facilitator in the state. We have a lot of work to be done in helping our dining halls become more ethical, more sustainable and more nutritious. 
  Both dining halls on campus still serve meat on Monday; many 
could even say they serve more meat on Mondays than any other day upon looking at the online menu. It’s up to all of us to help Gator Dining Services realize we care about the 27 billion animals who are slaughtered every year in America. It’s up to every single 
one of us to help Gator Dining Services realize we care about the 
60 million starving people who could be saved if every American 
left meat off his or her plate just 10 percent of the time. 
  Send our dining ofﬁ  cials a friendly e-mail to let them know 
you support their efforts to become better. Your suggestions on 
how we can constantly improve mean just as much as anyone 
else’s. Join our Meat-Free Monday at the University of Florida 
Facebook group to stay updated on our work. 
  It only seems right to pick one last quotation to close. And 
it only seems right to pick one from one of our world’s greatest 
leaders of change because that’s what we’re doing here, Gators, 
and as Gandhi once said, “Be the change you wish to see in the 
world.”

Meat-Free Monday at UF.  Work pays off for Meat-Free Monday supporters   Column

A Santa Fe College student was 
arrested after getting into a fight at 
a Gainesville apartment complex 
early Saturday morning.
Nicolas Fasanella, 19, was vis-
iting The Estates apartments on Southwest 20th Avenue, when he 
got into an argument with UF stu-dent Leland Jones, according to the 
Gainesville Police 
report.
As the fight es-
calated, Fasanella 
got physical and punched Jones straight in the jaw, 
the report stated.
According to 
police, Jones’ face was swollen when they arrived on the scene at 
about 1:50 a.m.
Fasanella admitted to his role in 
the fight.
Fasanella is charged with a first-
degree misdemeanor of simple bat-tery. 
He was released 3:45 p.m. Satur -
day on his own recognizance.
Jones was not charged in the in-
cident. Man arrested for fight at The Estates
dancing. 
Uchenna Echeazu, who worked with Huuda as  
a choreographer for the African Student Union, 
said that she was an energetic, upbeat woman, 
the type of person who would have preferred the dancing to the mourning. 
“She reminded us that regardless of where we 
go in life, we can always be a kid again,” Echeazu said.
Huuda’s body was found after firefighters ex-
tinguished a brush fire off of county Road 225, 
a half-mile north of the Gainesville Raceway. 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office 
spokesman Art Forgey said the medi-
cal examiner is still working to determine a cause 
of death, but the expectation is that the examiner 
will find she was murdered. 
There are no suspects in the case, though inves-
tigators have been actively interviewing people in hopes to make a breakthrough in the case.
Those with information relating to Huuda are 
urged to call the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office at 352-955-1818 or Crime Stoppers at 352-372-
STOP .Student’s death is still 
under investigation
VIGIL , from page 1
UF banned trips to Haiti after the earthquake
as an ironic triumph of sorts. 
Last February, UF instituted a policy that it wouldn’t 
sponsor student trips to Haiti, which meant that Bougher 
and Safiullin couldn’t go back to Haiti to collect more footage for their film with the backing of the Documentary Institute, a campus film program that is now based out of Wake Forest University . 
Then came what appeared to be the deal breaker when 
the two students were told by the College of Journalism and Communications that footage they shot in a trip to Haiti last March could not be used in their film, which was to be used in their master’s thesis. After a brief standoff shrouded in un-certainty, the two students were eventually allowed to use the footage and submit their documentary.
Although he described the episode as “unfortunate,” 
Bougher said he harbors no ill will toward any administra-tion officials and expressed much appreciation for the UF community . “It’s great to show the film anywhere, but it’s especially 
great to know that we’re appreciated at UF,” he said. “It’s a good feeling.” 
Sky Georges, president of Gators United for Haiti, one of 
the groups helping to organize the event, said a film such as “Bound by Haiti” helps in his group’s effort to raise aware-ness from students about the issues affecting Haiti.
“I’m very excited to see their work,” Georges said. “I’m 
hopeful that people can see the needs of the people before the earthquake and wonder, ‘Hey , what are the needs for these people?’”HAITI , from page 1Fasanella
“It’s great to show the film anywhere but 
it’s especially great to know that we’re             
appreciated at UF.”

The Gators’ celebration over 
their dual-meet victory at home 
against Georgia Tech was cut short by an injury scare from a UF swimmer who had to be pulled from the water during a race and 
checked on by paramedics.
Shara Stafford, a junior All-
American, was in the lead during 
the butterfly leg of the women’s 400-meter individual medley when she suddenly stopped at the pool’s edge, ripped off her cap and goggles, appeared distressed and tried to leave the water. 
She couldn’t get out of the pool 
under her own strength, so a UF assistant coach helped lift her out of the water and laid her on her back  while a University Athletic Association employee called 911.
About 15 minutes after Alach-
ua County Fire and Rescue para-medics began to attend to Stafford she was able to sit up and, soon 
after, walk on her own.
Following the meet, there was 
no word on what could have 
caused her condition in the pool. Both of the Gators’ swimming and diving teams were made un-available for comment, though UF coach Gregg Troy released a statement saying Stafford would 
be fine.“We’re just happy she’s going 
to be OK,” Troy said.
Before the 400 IM, Stafford, who 
is known for her sprinting prow-ess, contributed to the Gators’ vic-
tory in the 200-yard medley relay and also won the 50-yard freestyle in 23.18 seconds. Her performance helped the women grab first in all 14 swimming events and was one of six races in which the No. 6 Gators (3-3, 0-1 SEC) swept all 
three podium spots.
Florida also received a signifi-
cant contribution from freshman 
Elizabeth Beisel, who slapped the pool’s edge first in both of her in-dividual races: the 1,000-yard free-style (9:56.04) and the 200-yard breaststroke (2:17.03). Both were 
collegiate-best times for Beisel.
Despite not having been in 
the pool competitively in over 
a month, Florida racked up 169 points off its swimming and lone diving victory in the 3 meter. The Yellow Jackets finished with 106 points and a diving win in the 1 
meter. 
“We had a great swim meet 
against Georgia Tech tonight com-
ing off of the holiday break,” Troy said. “It was nice to see us swim so fast despite the long layoff.” 
The No. 5 men’s swimmers 
were equally dominant early on in the meet after splitting the first two dives with Georgia Tech. When they had their chance in the 
water, the Gators (3-2, 2-0 SEC) 
started the meet with six straight wins, losing only the 50-meter freestyle. 
Overall, Florida won 13 of 14 
swimming events and finished with 164.5 points and a 36-point win over the Yellow Jackets.
The men’s side was led by 
strong performances from seniors 
Conor Dwyer and Brett Fraser, 
who each won an individual event and contributed to the Gators’ sweep of both relay events. Their winning swim of 1:29.86 in the 200-yard medley relay was good for an NCAA “B” qualifying time.
“As we head into the meet 
against FAU on Saturday, this is 
exactly where I thought we would 
be at this point in the season,” Troy said.MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 13

 FLORIDA HAS ONE OPEN 
ASSISTANT COACHING POSITION REMAINING.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Will Muschamp has been 
Florida’s head coach for less than 
a month, but he has already ac-
complished a lot. 
Since being hired on Dec. 11,  
he has named eight coaches to his 
staff, including offensive coordi-nator and three-time Super Bowl 
winner Charlie Weis. And he has 
been busy on the recruiting trail as well, picking up a commit-ment from four-star safety Jabari 
Gorman last week.
However, Muschamp still has 
one spot left for another assistant 
coach.
The last hire UF announced 
was on Jan. 3, when Muschamp named Dan Quinn as his defen-sive coordinator.
That didn’t stop him from tak-
ing some time to address Gators fans at Saturday’s UF basketball 
game against Ole Miss, though. 
He was greeted by a standing ovation.
“I was on the road recruiting, and I didn’t feel like it would be fair during that time, because I need to spend my time recruit-ing right now,” Muschamp said to reporters of the lull in between hires. “We are trying to catch up.”
But Urban Meyer’s successor 
said he expects to talk to candi-dates for the last assistant coach-ing vacancy this week during a recruiting dead period. 
FUTURE COORDINATORS IN NFL:  
Both of Florida’s newly named 
coordinators took part in this 
weekend’s round of NFL playoff games.
Weis will be able to join the 
Gators’ recruiting team soon after 
a loss to the Ravens on Sunday. 
UF will have to wait on Quinn, 
however, after the Seahawks up-set the Saints.
“If I’m a high school football 
player and I want to have aspira-
tions of playing on the next level, 
which most kids do,” Muschamp said, “they are going to come to a great institution like the Univer -
sity of Florida. 
“They are going to get a great 
education and they are watching their future coaches coach and coordinate in the NFL Playoffs.”
MUSCHAMP NOT APPROACHED 
ABOUT TRANSFERS: The current 
transition period has not led play-
ers to transfer yet.
Muschamp said no current 
players have approached him 
about transferring away from Florida since he took over for 
Meyer.

In just more than two weeks, the Gators 
appear to have undergone a complete trans-
formation.
While the Florida of 2010 was consis-
tently undone by struggles with three-point shooting and ball movement, the 2011 squad has turned those tenets into its biggest strengths.
Thanks largely to 22 assists, 50 percent 
three-point shooting and a season-low seven turnovers, Florida (12-3, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) got the conference portion of its schedule off to a strong start with a 77-71 win 
over Ole Miss (12-4, 0-1 SEC) on Saturday 
night in the O’Connell Center.“Offensively we’re getting better and 
we’re starting to utilize each other,” coach Billy Donovan said. “We’re taking higher-percentage shots. … That’s how I’d like our team to play.”
The Gators were able to make the most 
out of their possessions 
against the Rebels’ tall, physical, high-pressure defense through stellar ball-handling and preci-sion passing.
Florida consistently 
worked the ball inside 
over the first 20 minutes, 
scoring 18 points in the 
paint in the first half.

The bejeweled blue leotards that 
hugged the Gators gymnastics squad 
weren’t the only things that shined 
on the O’Connell Center mats Friday night. No. 3 Florida squashed No. 10 Nebraska with a final score of 196.925 
to 194.950.
Senior Maranda Smith, granted a 
sixth year of eligibility this summer, 
returned as the first competitor in the opening event of the evening.
“Monday, Adrian (Burde, Gators 
assistant coach) came up to me dur -
ing practice and was like ‘You’re go-ing to go first this weekend on vault just to kind of be a face that the judges 
are used to seeing,’” Smith said. “It felt pretty good that my coaches had 
that confidence in me and that I could go out there — first up, first meet, first time in 2011 — and be the one to hit 
a vault.”
Smith got the job done, earning Florida beats Nebraska

nected on 9 of 18 attempts in the game.
“Our guys are doing a better job, and our 
shot distribution is better balanced,” Donovan said. “Our guys are being a little more patient and we’ve got a better balance of inside-out than we’ve had the last month or so.”
Starters Kenny Boynton, Vernon Macklin, 
Chandler Parsons and Erving Walker com-bined for 70 of the team’s 77 points.
Parsons played another strong all-around 
game with 17 points, seven rebounds and five assists, while also connecting on all three attempts from beyond the arc.
“I really thought Chandler Parsons had a 
totally complete game,” Donovan said. “He’s really, the last couple of games, played excep-tionally well.”
Walker scored a team-high 20 points, 
which put him over 1,000 for his career.
He and Boynton combined to record the 
team’s final 16 as the Gators held off the Reb-els’ furious charge late in the contest.
Boynton scored nine points, including his 
third four-point play in as many games, on 3-of-4 shooting over the game’s final 3:04.“Those guys are stepping into the shot 
knowing they’re going to make the shot,” Parsons said. “We need that from them; they’re scorers. They hit some big shots right 
when Ole Miss started go-ing on some runs.”
The Rebels’ rally was 
fueled by senior Chris War -
ren, who scored all 20 of his 
points in the second half.
After feeling out Flori-
da’s defense with an 0-for-
4 first-half shooting performance, Warren 
turned it on and connected on four of his five three-point attempts over the final 20 min-utes.
“We were aware that he was going to try 
to take over the game, and he did,” Donovan said. “He singlehandedly almost won the game for them.”
But in the end, Warren’s efforts were not 
enough, and the Gators walked away with their third consecutive win over a quality op-
ponent.
“We’re playing really well right now,” 
Parsons said. “We still have a lot of room to 
get better, but it definitely feels pretty good to get a win like this.”MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15
 UF ENDED ITS FOUR-
GAME ROAD LOSING STREAK.
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
In a game dominated by Flori-
da’s post presence, it was a guard 
who stole the show.
Ndidi Madu scored a career-
high 17 points and Jennifer George 
added 10 rebounds, but Lanita 
Bartley’s steal and layup with just 16 seconds remaining sealed a 65-63 victory for UF (12-5, 2-1 South-eastern Conference) over host South Carolina (9-7, 1-2 SEC).Trailing by one with only 32 
seconds remaining, the Gators 
found themselves in control for 
the final possession with a chance to win. But Deana Allen’s jumper in the lane missed everything and went out of bounds, giving South Carolina possession. 
However, Bartley grabbed a 
steal on the ensuing inbounds play, hit the go-ahead layup in 
traffic and drew a foul to clinch 
the Florida victory.
“Every time she came to the 
bench, I kept telling her, ‘You’re going to make the play. We just need you to stay intense and ready,’” coach Amanda Butler said. “It just so happens that she gets the huge and-one at the end that puts us ahead.
“We practice late-game situa-
tions every day, and I’m sure the team gets tired of it, but this is why you do it.”
Sunday’s win 
snaps a streak of  four consecutive losses away from Gainesville.
After besting 
the Gamecocks in nearly every facet, it appeared the Gators’ 19 
turnovers would bear the blame for yet another close loss. Instead, it was an uncharacteristic miscue, and only the 10th South Carolina turnover, that set up the final pos-session and victory for Florida. 
The Gators, who did most of 
their damage inside, were 26 of 46 from the floor for a season-high 56.5 shooting percentage.
Florida captain and leading 
scorer Jordan Jones, a former Gamecock, struggled to get open looks but made the most of them when she did. Jones (six points) fought her way open and drained 
a three with 1:31 remaining, giv-
ing the Gators a 62-61 lead.
It was a back-and-forth battle 
for much of the final 20 minutes, and a Gators team not known for finishing in crunch time finally got it done. 
Freshman guard Jaterra Bonds 
finished with 11 points and Bartley added nine points, four rebounds and two steals as Florida finished 
its two-game road swing at 1-1.  
Madu’s 17 points came on 7-of-
9 shooting in only 22 minutes of 
action. Butler praised Madu for taking comfortable looks and her team as a whole for winning the edge in rebounding. 
“To win the rebounding battle 
is the story of the game because 
we had to get stops and we had to 
get rebounds,” Butler said. “This was a great win and a big momen-tum builder, as we have the op-portunity to return and play back on our home court on Thursday.” 
A radio broadcast contributed to 
this report.

a 9.825. She also recorded a 9.900 perfor -
mance on floor exercise, a routine that she 
learned less than a week ago.
“I had a different routine earlier in the 
preseason, but it just wasn’t really fitting my personality very much,” she said. “It 
was great music but I just felt that I couldn’t 
put myself out there and really shine. So I was just excited that I had a floor routine that I loved and performed great and hit all my passes.”
Joining Smith in the second place spot in 
floor was all-around competitor and fresh-man Alaina Johnson, just one of the new faces for the Gators this season. 
Johnson had an impressive start for the 
Gators, scoring first in uneven parallel bars 
(9.925) and second in vault (9.850).
Fellow freshmen Mackenzie Caquatto 
and Brittney Noble also got their first taste 
of college competition. Noble three-way tied for third in bars, while Caquatto tied

all around every single competition. We’re 
definitely going to be juggling the lineups a bit this year.”
Returning sophomore Ashanée Dick-
erson snagged her eighth all-around title, winning the vault, balance beam and floor exercise.
“She just is so solid and I knew it was go-
ing to be amazing when she went out and stuck that vault,” Faehn said. “She works so hard and has the best attitude and work out, so it’s nice to see her be able to be re-warded for that.”
On the balance beam, neighboring soph-
omore Marissa King had a shaky perfor -
mance, falling to a 9.450.
“It wasn’t the back series, it was actually 
in the air where something slightly twisted 
which made me come down and have that 
slight wobble — that big wobble,” King said. “It’s beam, you know. Beam is always 
50/50.”
King rose up when it came time to floor, 
earning a 9.875 on a routine she learned a 
week ago. 
“It was new, it was very fresh,” she said. 
“That’s what I like though because I’ve had my old floor routine for a while and it’s nice to get a new routine, new choreography, a 
new buzz to the feeling of performing.”
Faehn said that this year’s approach will 
be to take the season in steps.
“We just want to take it one day at a time 
and improve every single weekend and do 
some unbelievable gymnastics,” she said. “And I think that we’re going to have a real positive outcome.”GYM , from page 1416, ALLIGATOR n MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 2011
