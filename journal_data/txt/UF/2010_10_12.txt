Goodbye Nickelback, hello Ras-
cal Flatts.
Sometime in the next week, UF’s 
radio frequency , 103.7, will move to 
a country music format, replacing 
the mainstream-rock format it has 
aired since the 1980s.
“From an industry standpoint, 
country is a very successful mass-appeal format in the Gainesville/Ocala area,” said Randy Wright, ex-ecutive director of media properties at UF. 
The new station will be called 
Country 103.7 — The Gator, and while it will still be broadcasting all Gator athletics, it will not feature the syndicated show Lex and Terry , which has been a Rock 104 staple for years.
The change was made for several 
reasons, Wright said, but monetary issues were at the forefront. 
In an e-mail to faculty and staff at 
the College of Journalism and Com-munications, Wright said that coun-try music is the most popular music format in the U.S., while “Active Rock“ holds the No. 15 spot. The e-mail also said the biggest growth in the country music audience is among 18-24 year olds.
However, Rock 104 isn’t being 
replaced. Instead, the station will move to a new home online and will be known as Rock104.com.
Wright said he was excited about 
the change because Rock104.com 
will not only give the university an 
avenue to allow its students to dab-ble in new media, but it also frees the station from financial pressures.
Among changes he said may 
be coming are the incorporation of more independent and local music, as well as live disc jockeys.
“You’re taking financial pres-
sure off the product, and the focus becomes the product itself,” he said.
Wright said he is open to input 
from students about what kind of content they would like to hear as the station undergoes its transfor -
mation. Later this week, he will be 
creating an e-mail address where 
students can send suggestions.
“There’s nothing negative about 
this at all,” Wright said. “We’re ac-tually investing in Rock 104. We’re investing in that format. We’re mov-ing it onto a platform young adults are embracing and using every sin-gle day.”Rock 104 makes

Gainesville Police are investi-
gating the recent kidnapping and 
rape of a local woman after she re-
ported the incident herself Sunday night.
The victim told police she was 
grabbed and forced into a car on 
the 500 block of Southwest Sev-
enth Terrace at about 10:30 p.m., according to GPD spokeswoman Tscharna Senn.
During the next hour, the victim 
was driven somewhere unknown, raped and then dropped back off where she’d been picked up.
The victim reported the inci-
dent to police shortly after being 
dropped off, said Lt. Rob Koehler.
The status of the victim was un-
known at press time.

the incident is asked to call 352-

While budget reform, im-
migration and health care have 
dominated this election season, Democratic gubernatorial candi-date Alex Sink brought attention 
to education issues Monday. 
Speaking in a conference call 
with student reporters, Sink, 
Florida’s chief financial officer, vowed to improve the state’s ed-ucation system, which has been plagued by budget cuts.   
Sink said the key to improv-
ing education would be to rede-sign our economy. She wants to 
transform the state from depend-
ing on tourism to fostering health care and high-tech industries. 
Sink also briefly discussed 
the process of selecting future appointments to the Florida Board of Gover -
nors, the body that oversees the state’s sys-tem of public universities. If 
elected, she said she would ap-point members who she felt were not only qualified but also com-mitted to doing the job.
“We’re not looking for po-
litical hacks or people designed to be on the board for political 
gain,” she said. 
Throughout her conference 
call, Sink made no specific refer -
ence to her opponent, Republi-
can nominee and former health care CEO Rick Scott, choosing only to focus on her individual positions.
“I know that I have the char -
acter, honesty and integrity that people are looking for in their next governor,” she said.Sink pledges to help schools

Turnout for the show was higher than expected, 
Cheng said. The budget for the event was about $2,000.
Jen Kwok, known for her work on Comedy Central

TAMPA — A Florida couple thought they were buying 
a Halloween decoration at a yard sale, but it turns out they 
bought a real human skeleton. Judith and Mitchell Fletcher 
paid $8 for what they thought were a box of scary holiday 
decorations at a yard sale in Brandon. When they got the box home, they realized they had bought real bones.
They called the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. 
Detectives took the bones to the medical examiner, who de-termined they came from a professionally prepared human anatomical skeleton, normally used in medical courses.
Sheriff’s spokesperson Cristal Bermudez Nunez said de-
tectives are contacting colleges and universities who may be 
missing a skeleton.
State law prohibits individuals from owning human skel-
etons, so the Fletchers won’t get the bones back.Couple buy real

A university official defended a 
professor today who was accused by 
an animal-activist blogger of “animal murder.”
Camille Marino, a Wildwood-based 
activist who runs the “Negotiation is Over!” website, cited a study in which researchers placed electrodes on the brains of Macaque monkeys. Ming-zhou Ding, who teaches biomedical engineering at UF, authored a paper on the subject. A post on Marino’s blog called Ding a “Torture-Murderer” and described his tactics as “sociopathic sadism.”
But according to UF 
Public Affairs director Jan-ine Sikes, the experiments were not done at UF and the data were public do-
main.
“Organizations such as this use 
mischaracterizations and inaccuracies to make an argument, and they falsely alleged things about this individual who just analyzed the data,” Sikes said.
Marino admitted she thought Ding 
did the experiments himself and that 
she’s now “willing to defer on this 
single issue.”
“I’ll take it as a given that he didn’t 
do the mutilation,” she said. “But that doesn’t mitigate culpability.”

ment. UF defends accused ‘animal murderer’ACADEMIC PROFILEBy ESTEE BECK

When his parents asked about 
what they found on the family com-puter’s research history , Anthony Dretzka denied everything.
When he was 14, Dretzka, now 
20, was researching information about what it means to be gay to make sense of the feelings he was having; they were feelings nobody had ever taught him. 
His parents saw the search his-
tory and confronted him and his brother. His mom cried. His dad yelled. And it was clear to Dretzka 
that he would never be able to tell 
his parents who he really was. 
Dretzka, a family , youth and 
community science junior, was on the Plaza of the Americas Monday afternoon celebrating National Com-ing Out Day, hosted by the UF’s Les-bian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Affairs. 
National Coming Out Day was 
founded in 1988, according to A.C. Stokes, director of LGBT Affairs. 
It’s a celebration of the 
LGBTQ community 
and the importance of having a positive com-ing out experience, 
Stokes said.
The highlight of the day’s fes-
tivities was the debut of the Out Project, a display of 80 anonymous postcards collected between January 
and October. They’re decorated with 
messages and illustrations about the fears and joys related to the coming out experience. 
“Coming out is not something to 
be taken lightly,” said Steven Sweat, a second-year graduate student and director of the Out Project. 
The postcards are meant to start 
discussions about coming out and to let the LGBTQ community members of Gainesville know they are sup-ported, Sweat said.
Dretzka, who came out to his best friend in October last year, says 
he still lives a double life. When he 
goes home, he has to pretend he’s somebody he’s not. In Gainesville, though, he can be himself. 
He’s training to be part of an out-
reach group that shares its personal experiences, including coming out stories, in an effort to make new or uncertain members of the LGBTQ 
community more comfortable with 
the process.
“An event like this really helps,” 
said Dretzka. “It lets you know you’re not alone.”

Alex Green takes his name literally.
Green, a retired UF physics professor and founder 
of Green Liquid and Gas Technologies, showcased 
his new environmentally conscious invention on Sunday afternoon at the Open House and Biochar 
Event. 
The Green Pyrolyzer Gasifier, or GPG,  processes 
more than 20 different types of organic waste and 
heats it indirectly. The process doesn’t expose the waste to oxygen. 
By not burning the biomass completely, the pro-
cess yields a byproduct called biochar, which can be used both as an additive to improve soil fertility. 
The created energy can also be used to heat green-
houses or small-scale steam turbines, said Andrew Zimmerman, a UF assistant professor of geological sciences.
The idea for the GPG began in 1996 when Green 
realized that he could power a small-scale turbine generator without oil or natural gas.
He said he had trouble convincing Gainesville 
Regional Utilities and city residents of the benefits 
of using biomass, and it wasn’t considered a serious 
option.
“Everybody has long been talking about alter -
native fuels, but people don’t realize how serious a 
problem it is,” he said. 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 
which pioneered GPS technology, supported Green 
to develop a prototype of the GPG, although work on it took longer than the standard two-year inter -
val. 
The first prototype has been ready since May and 
will be sold to a research and development agency in Quincy, Fla. in November. However, the company 
is still struggling to expand commercial use of the 
machine. 
A veteran of World War II, Green saw firsthand 
the negative effects of being dependent on nonre-newable energy sources. He said there is a direct link 
between his work computing airplane fuel consump-
tion during the war and his current efforts toward finding alternative energy.Former professor

It was fate.
It had to be, right?She missed him by five days on Match.
com, and they were 100 percent compat-ible. He sounded intelligent, educated like her.
“He was so cute,” she said, “and seemed 
like a really good person.”
Emily Harwood, 25, is a University of 
North Florida grad with a degree in psy-chology. She lives in Jacksonville and works as a stock broker. Her eyes are sharp hazel. She plays paintball. She’s changed her hair from red to black to blond. One day she wants to marry an extraordinary man and have cute, educated, compassion-ate children.
She’s not the type you’d expect to leave 
a Craigslist ad. Those are for the lonely. The desperate. Sad people with missing teeth who live in trailers and eat Spaghet-tiOs out of the can.
He stayed in the back of her mind, and 
three months later, totally unprepared, she 
saw him.
Craigslist missed connections ads are 
second chances in the digital age. You see 
someone attractive, your heart flutters, but you don’t have the gall. Later, when you’re 
alone, you use the same site some use to 
give away sofas. You take comfort in the 
sweet anonymity of the computer screen.
The real, longing messages follow a pat-
tern. First, there’s the acknowledgment that 
this might not work, that it’s a shot in the 
dark. Next, how the person was noticed, 
and you felt something immediately. And then the actual moment, the connection, be it casual conversation or eye contact, held 
just a little too long. The ads end by asking 
for some detail about the encounter, just to 
be sure.
Emily’s was simple:“At the Gas Station before the USF/
Gator game Saturday - w4m - 28 (gas sta-
tion in Clearwater area)
“I know this is a long shot, I’ve never 
tried this, but I saw you at the gas station 
on Saturday afternoon, you were wearing a Gator jersey and talking to the store clerk, and you have a blue car — I think. You are tall, probably 6’0-6’2? and very attractive ... I was the blonde with my pregnant friend. I can’t stop thinking about it.”
The ads were created in 2000. Craigslist 
employees noticed “I saw you” messages popping up in the personals section and chose the name of the category as a trans-portation metaphor.
The idea is not new, but it can be pro-
hibitively difficult to leave these messages for the intended recipient in a large city without technological help.
Missed connections are a natural pro-
gression of social networking, said David Carlson, a professor of new media journal-ism at UF.
“It’s just another arrow in Cupid’s 
quiver,” he said.
According to the Chicago Tribune, so 
many people in Chicago post about en-counters at train stops that Craigslist did 
a study on which was the most used. (It 
was Belmont.) New York City actress Me-
lissa Center was inspired by the ads and started acting them out on YouTube in a series called Missed Connections Live. 
Children’s book artist Sophie Blackall cre-
ates images of the ads on her blog.
According to Gambit, the most popu-
lar place to have a missed connection in 
New Orleans is the Whole Foods produce 
aisle. The New York Times has 
published verbatim romantic 
poems found on the site in an article appropriately titled “Po-
etic Connections.”
This is good for a site that just last 
month shut down another popular cor -
ner of its business: “Adult Services.” The company was pressured by state attorneys general and other groups, who accused the 
site of displaying ads that were fronts for 
prostitution.
All kinds of yearnings still find their 
way onto the site, and yes, into the missed 
connections. Lonely housewives search for lusty liaisons, a man gets midget porn left in his mailbox, another waits in a bathroom stall for a “great time,” but his intended never shows up.
Emily’s ad, like most, stems from a cri-
sis of confidence.
That particular Saturday morning, Em-
ily was dragging. She was in Tampa for the weekend with her pregnant friend, Stephanie, who could go into labor “at a minute’s notice.”
They napped, watched TV, hit Babies 
“R” Us.
Stephanie, not being familiar with the 
area, pulled into a random gas station. Em-ily, in a strapless blue shirt with a heart on the front, needed coffee.
She walked into the store, and her jaw 
dropped. It was him. The one from from Match.com. Mr. 100 Percent Compat-ible. He was just a few feet in front of her wearing basketball shorts and a sleeveless Gators shirt. He looked fit in person. At-
tractive. 
They made eye contact and held it 
through a blink. She thought he recog-
nized her. She felt it, whatever it was. Her heart hopped, and with her jaw still open, 
she ran to the coffee counter and hid. She 
called Stephanie over with her hands and 
vigorously started pointing and mouthing the words, “I know him!”
He was at the register laughing with the 
clerk. She waited. He went and sat in his 
car. One hundred thoughts for every step. 
Should she talk to him? Could she? Would she sound like a fool? Would he laugh? While the clerk talked to Stephanie about 
her pregnancy, Emily was a civil war.
She decided, in her panic, that talking 
to him would be a clear signal to him that 
she was insane.
She looked at him when she walked by. 
He looked back. She and Stephanie got in 
the car and drove by him, another look. He 
followed them out, but they turned left, and he was gone.  
All weekend she wrestled with it. What 
are the chances? There’s only one sure way to test fate in the Internet age —  missed connections.
She had a friend who tried it and it 
worked; they had gone out twice, only twice, but still.
Emily’s ad was up by Monday night. “A 
final resort,” she told herself.
She’s still waiting.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A schleppy superhero for our time
Our society has been picking straws for years in the 
superhero department, forced to borrow champi-ons of yore and update them to the modern era. 
This was fooling nobody. Emo Batman and a metro-
sexual Superman show these protagonist paradigms are empty vessels unable to function as cultural ideals in the modern era.
Enter Tim Wentworth.Tubby and bespectacled, this middle-aged Midwest-
ern avenger swooped down in his van and quickly scooped up about $3 million of loose cash that had fallen out of the back of an armored truck in downtown India-
napolis.
With $20 bills floating through the air like confetti and 
a mad dash for cash all around him, Wentworth stepped 
into the fray and began to fend off the evil opportunists 
who felt the series of fortunate events that resulted in 
random money falling from the sky was somehow justifi-cation to abandon the values that made America great.
Tim Wentworth knows banks need money far more 
than the average American does, and  even though this 
seems like a case of fate smiling upon the downtrodden 
residents of a besieged American city, it’s actually an op-portunity to explore the collective hopes and ideals of our culture through the actions of a modern-day super -
hero.
Schlepping around in an ill-fitting polo and proudly 
sporting a pair of prodigious man boobs, this brave de-fender of the banking sector knows American greatness stems from our ability to nurture and feed houses of 
wealth.
Far from a divine and direct stimulus, the actions that 
led to millions of dollars falling into the middle of the street were certainly the work of 
a being unfamiliar with the way America works.
Wentworth was quoted as stat-
ing he saw “people grabbing 20s left and right and having a good time,” and this was clearly not part 
of the grand plan. He knew, deep 
in his tiny heart, the cash was in-
tended to be paid to some millionaire in the form of a dividend and not merely grabbed up by some grubby layperson late on his or her mortgage.
“I figure somebody needs that money somewhere” 
was the exact quotation he used, applying personhood exclusively to the financial institution that served as the intended recipient of the bundled cash. 
The unbelievably lucky people running away covered 
in Jacksons must have been something closer to ghouls in Wentworth’s telling of the story.
This story, though, is our story — the story of a brave 
new world where the Supreme Court rules businesses 
and bundled money in the form of interest groups have 
a more pressing need to free and unfettered speech than an individual citizen.
Everything about what the cash grabbers did was il-
legal, and Wentworth is being hailed as an exemplary citizen and Good Samaritan for his actions. But it can’t be surprising in a place where banks got bailed out and neighborhoods continue to empty out in a perverse fire drill, a man fighting to keep found money in the safety of 
a bank is a true hero indeed.

als to get riled up about with megaphones and hand-
made signs, chanting phrases we’re all tired of hearing.
These attacks are becoming personal and irrefutably 
more degrading as society supposedly becomes more pro-
gressive. 
The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. once said, “Injustice 
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
And if the great crusader for equality of the ‘60s was 
right, all of us should fear for our lives, for we find our -
selves now facing overt and subliminal homophobia the 
majority of society does little to stop. 
UF and the rest of the world celebrated National Com-
ing Out Day Monday, encouraging oppressed LGBTQ 
youth to admit to their peers and everyone else who will 
listen that they are, in fact, neighbors in this acronymic 
community. While we support the event and are thrilled to see our peers professing pride, we are left with a bitter taste at the necessity of such an event. 
First, we wonder why participants in UF’s Coming Out 
Day feel forced to admit their differences to a larger com-munity that has long thrived on taking their rights away or watched silently as it happened — as if the right to mar -
ry, adopt children, serve in the military, inherit benefits or 
walk in the street openly were inherently reserved for the 
heterosexual population.
And secondly, we are forced with the realization that 
such an event really is necessary. As society is forced to react to and face the truth Tyler Clementi revealed to an 
indifferent and uninformed country, the grim realities gay 
youth face every day are becoming increasingly palpable.
But the greatest injustice we face as UF celebrated its 
own Coming Out Day in the days following Clementi’s 
horrifically disconsolate act is the truth that suicides 
among gay teens happen at an increasingly alarming rate. 
The greatest injustice we face is not watching eight New 
York City adults repeatedly dehumanize another human being by shoving miniature baseball bats and the ends of 
plungers into his rectum for being gay last week. It’s the 
fact that the majority of us remain silent in the face of more psychologically painful prejudices such as a New York gu-bernatorial hopeful blatantly and unabashedly saying it’s 
wrong to have children “brainwashed” into thinking ho-
mosexuality is an acceptable option.
The greatest injustice we face is remaining silent in the 
face of such blatant and unwarranted hatred. The great-est injustice we face is continuing to label the persecuted 
the problem and the plague while the persecutor retains 
power. 
We have reached a point where each and every one of 
us should ask what right we have to take the opportunity 
to love, marry and pursue happiness from others. 
These rights to love openly and legally, the right  het-
erosexuals have claimed as their own in the vast majority 
of states, are inherently not and have never been reserved for those so divinely privileged to be heterosexual. 
It’s time for the rest of us to come out. It’s time for us 
to realize injustice anywhere is a threat to justice every-where.

Letters to the Editor
Former columnist offers explanation
I want to thank The Alligator for the ex-
traordinary opportunity given to me. It is a 
great privilege to be allowed to write a col-umn. 
I tried to bring a different point of view to 
the paper, and to some extent, I believe I suc-ceeded. I want to state this up front. I made a serious mistake. I was wrong not to give proper attribution to some material I reformu-lated for use in my column. I was unaware of the necessity of such a citation in this case and never had any intention of wrongdoing. I am not trying to offer any excuses, but I do believe an explanation is in order.
I was trying to write a lighthearted and 
casual column with the theme of taking our minds off the midterm boredom. I was trying to make the point our immediate preoccupa-tions are small in the larger scheme of things. I selected a few comments from a large pool of reader-submitted facts in a thread at Reddit.com and reworded them to fit my column.
The title of the thread was “What’s the most 
mind-blowing fact you heard/read in your life?” From the title of the thread, I took it to be a sort of reference work, something like an 
encyclopedia of unusual facts. The title of the 
thread implied these facts were sourced from elsewhere. I did not view them as original ma-terial but rather as items of generally available knowledge. In several cases I had to correct the “facts” as they appeared on Reddit. The Reddit post was wrong about the length of the Wright Brothers first flight and another post misstated the location of the Voyager 1 spacecraft. I re-
searched this material and corrected the facts 
before putting them in my column. 
However, that did not go far enough. I wish 
to state again I made a serious mistake. It was carelessness on my part not to consider the necessity of a direct citation from which the facts were culled. I never had any intention of using pre-authored material as my own; I just thought I would present interesting facts to the reader. At the very least I should have given an attribution naming Reddit.com as the source of these facts.
I wish to apologize to The Alligator and its 
readers for this error.

Columnist’s behavior disappointing
When I first read Bryan Griffin’s Thursday 
column, I found it encouraging he would at-tempt to broaden his horizons and break from his normal pattern of beating Republican talk-ing points. However, when it came to my atten-tion  Griffin had plagiarized, I could only feel 
disappointed. Griffin and I rarely agreed on 
political issues during our four years together as undergraduates, but I always thought he took his paeans to justice and American values seriously . Sadly , I was mistaken. 
His actions also demonstrate he could not 
possibly perform honest service for the citi-zens of Alachua County as their representa-tive on the Soil and Water Conservation Board 
from District 4. Griffin should do the honor -
able thing and resign and immediately sus-
pend his campaign. Knowing Griffin’s outsize ego, I view this as unlikely .

Campus should enforce smoking policy
What good is a rule if there are no mecha-
nisms in place to enforce it? I’m talking about UF’s no-smoking policy . I see people every day , all day , smoking on campus, and they’re not even having to hide because they know 
there’s nothing anybody can do to them. I 
think on-campus smokers should be ticketed for the offense. If you were to add $5 to that $4 pack of cigarettes, I bet people would think twice about lighting up on campus.

It’s still great to be a Florida Gator
Why does our football team only sing with 
the band and the fans after a win? I wasn’t as disappointed by the loss on Saturday as I was by how we trudged off the field with our tails between our legs. I hate losing as much 
as the next orange-and-blue-blooded fan, but 
it’s still great to be a Florida Gator, and an-other team can’t take that away . We let them have the game, but we didn’t have to let them have our pride. Our team should sing with the band even after a loss, because “in all kinds of 
weather we’ll all  stick together.”

Griffin unoriginal, unethical
I wrote last week that Bryan Griffin’s col-
umns were unoriginal. In addition to his radi-
cally conservative views, the fact The Alligator fired him for his plagiarism shows he is unfit for any public office. When you go to the polls 
this November, be sure to vote against him for Alachua County Soil and Water Seat 4.

UF still Florida’s top public institution
I am a faithful Alligator reader, and I must 
say sometimes I both agree and respectfully 
disagree with opinions from the Editorial Board.  However, to say UF has lost its luster as the top school in the state reflects short-
sighted thinking and a lack of understanding 
U.S. News and World Report rankings. To tie this change in rankings to a few football game losses is an extremely immature conclusion. 
In the past three years, UF has gone in 
rankings from a high of 47th to a low of 53rd, while in this same time span the University of Miami has gone from 54th to 47th. To some it would seem as though UM has become a bet-
ter school while UF has lost its academic supe-
riority . This is not the case. 
UF is still the best public school in the state 
and is the best value by far. Florida State Uni-versity is the next-closest public school, and it is 51 spots away . Additionally , the changes in how U.S. News weighs specific metrics in its ranking formula also changes the rankings. Fluctuations in rank could be due to a host of 
factors, the least likely of which, in my opin-
ion, is loss of academic superiority. 
UF is one of the premier schools in the 
country, which is why it is a member of the Association of American Universities. One of 63 schools, membership is by invitation only, and the member institutions include the likes of Harvard University; Princeton University; University of California, Berkeley; Univer -
sity of Michigan and a host of other premier public and private institutions. We are the only school in the state to be a member of the AAU and have been so for 25 years. While I do not dismiss the academic reputation of other schools in the state, UF is still, by and large, 
the best school in Florida. More and more stu-
dents want to come here because we are the best Florida has to offer.
While it is true some students tie academic 
excellence to athletic prowess, I’m shocked The Alligator would make such a claim. I am a Gators fan, and I have been at UF during the majority of its athletic dominance. Experi-ences in The Swamp and the O’Connell Cen-ter enhance my academic experience, but they do not define it. Saturdays in The Swamp are fun, but Monday through Friday is why stu-
dents attend UF. I have faith Urban Meyer will 
get things corrected and will be playing for a Southeastern Conference championship.
Florida is a great school both academi-cally and athletically . I know for a fact many students want to come to UF because of all it has to offer. The next time we wish to ring 
the alarm because of a few athletic letdowns, 
I suggest we make sure there’s an actual crisis instead of inventing one.

UF great before Tebow, will be great after
I have to disagree with Monday’s editorial. 
First of all, UF was never invincible, even with Tim Tebow. He was a significant contribution to our football success, but Tebow didn’t make or break the team. Chris Leak was the one who 
led the 2006 Gators to a national title. 
UF’s decline in academics is likely due to 
budget cuts. If you don’t have the funds to 
properly teach, your academics will suffer.
Sadly , I’m pretty sure even teenagers in 
Gainesville don’t know about the newly built 
College of Pharmacy campus in Orlando. And 
even though Tebow left, our pharmacy school is still ninth in the nation. But sports are more exciting to follow than academics.
UF is not synonymous with Tebow; it was 
a great university before he came and still is 
now that he’s done. Even if we have a little 
“slump,” it’s always great to be a Florida Gator. Just ask the alumni who attended our university when we weren’t winning titles.

Gator glory alive and well
I was shocked by the assertion UF is “no 
longer an academic [and] athletic force” and it has returned to “mediocrity” after falling behind the University of Miami as the top-ranked college in Florida. 
I am proud to attend the best public uni-
versity in the state, and I would encourage any incoming freshman to consider UM if 
they want to pay $37,000 in yearly tuition. 
Furthermore, I find it ridiculous after our 
football team has suffered two losses, one at 
the hands of the formerly best-ranked team 
in the nation, the assumption could be made our athletic program is subpar.  Our No. 2 volleyball and No. 6 soccer teams continue to play very well. I cannot think of another uni-versity that consistently produces such high-caliber teams in practically every sport. 
Gator glory is dead? I think not.

CAPE CANAVERAL — There’s 
still the matter of money. But it looks 
increasingly likely that NASA will get an extra space shuttle flight.President Barack Obama signed a 
NASA spending bill into law Mon-day, following last week’s approval by Congress. The measure directs NASA to move forward with an additional shuttle flight to the International Space Station, before retiring the fleet.
Sally Ride, the first American wom-
an in space who took part in a White-House ordered review of human space-flight, said the extra flight represents “an important extension” for support-ing the space station.
The orbiting lab is meant to operate 
until at least 2020, with U.S. astronauts 
hitching rides on Russian Soyuz cap-
sules until private companies in Amer -
ica can pick up the slack.
During a telephone press conference 
Monday, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said the funding issue should be resolved once Congress returns next month to Washington in a lame duck session. The space agency expects a final deci-
sion no later than December.
Only two shuttle launches officially 
remain, with the next one coming up 
Nov. 1. The third, yet-to-be-formalized mission would take place next June. At-lantis already is being prepped in case it needs to rescue the crew of Endeav-our, set to fly in February.
Only four astronauts — instead of 
the usual six or seven — are assigned to that rescue mission. The crew size will remain the same if NASA gets the third shuttle flight. NASA wants to limit the number of crew members who would need to take refuge at the space station in case Atlantis is damaged at liftoff and couldn’t be flown back to Earth.
Those four shuttle astronauts would 
need to return on Soyuz spacecraft over the course of a year.
The NASA Engineering and Safety 
Center reported last month that the risks associated with an additional shuttle flight — with no shuttle backup — were in line with others accepted by the shuttle and station programs in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster.
Nelson said an additional flight will 
ease the impact of shuttle job cuts.
“Instead of the shuttle work force 
dropping precipitously off of a cliff, it smooths that transition” as work be-gins on a new heavy-lift rocket and commercial spacecraft pick up steam, the senator said. He described the post-shuttle period as “the new NASA.”
Obama’s plan for NASA calls for 
eventual missions by astronauts to asteroids and Mars, and shelves his predecessor’s goal of returning to the moon.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2010

� THE CASE WAS COLD 
UNTIL 2009.
By GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Prosecutors say the murder of 
Wayne “Frog” Hutchinson went 
down in an overcrowded house in Hawthorne — an eruption of vio-lence and the bloody work of two screwdriver-wielding criminals.
But the defense asks, where’s the 
blood? Where’s the Phillips head 
screwdriver? Where’s the proof?
Hutchinson was killed seven 
years ago Monday at the age of 45. 
On Friday , after five days of trial 
and more than six hours of delib-
eration, jurors emerged deadlocked, and a mistrial was declared by pre-siding Circuit Judge Mark W. Mose-ley  Friday night.
A new trial was scheduled for the week of Nov . 1, when prosecutors will again try to prove that Eddie Gillins, Jr., 55, and William Leander 
Bascomb, 41, planned Hutchinson’s 
death. 
Witnesses said a screwdriver was 
used to stab Hutchinson repeatedly in the chest and stomach, but the medical examiner said Hutchin-son was never stabbed in the chest or stomach, but rather in the neck, by what would have been a knife 
blade.
The 2003 murder investigation 
ran cold until Terrence Gillins asked 
to be interviewed from a Florida state prison.
He accused his uncle, Eddie Gil-
lins, and Bascomb of the murder. The men were arrested in 2009, six years after the event, and have been 
in prison for more than a year await-
ing trial.
Terrence Gillins said he was there 
when Eddie Gillins choked Hutchin-son from behind while stabbing him repeatedly in the chest and stomach with a Phillips head screwdriver.
Bascomb helped drag his body 
behind a newspaper container in the 
dirt lot of 6419 SE 215th St. in Haw-
thorne, where it was later found, Terrence Gillins said.
But Gillins said 
a lot of things. 
His story has 
changed six times 
since the start of the investigation, and the other three witnesses for the prosecution have changed theirs multiple times as well.
One witness also admitted to 
being on the far end of a three-day 
crack cocaine binge when she saw 
the suspects near the murder scene.
Each were also being rewarded 
by the state for their cooperation in the trial, according to the defense.
In closing remarks, the defense 
said the questionable testimony 
from unreliable witnesses contra-
dicts what little evidence there is.
The investigation of the murder 
scene returned almost nothing. No murder weapon. No DNA. No fin-gerprints. No blood trails. 
The medical examiner, however, 
did find a bag of crack cocaine, a bag of marijuana and $48 in the vic-
tim’s pockets. The defense said that 
if Gillins and Bascomb had robbed Hutchinson, they didn’t do a very good job.
The autopsy also found that the 
strangulation would have been caused by rope or a cord, not possi-bly by someone’s arm from behind. 
Both defendants have criminal 
records: Gillins has 11 past felony charges as well as 26 aliases. But, the defense reminded the jury not to let that sway their decision.  Under federal law, the prosecu-
tion must prove the guilt of the de-fendants beyond a reasonable doubt 
in the jury’s mind. 
Gillins’ defense attorney , Michael 
Finesilver, said that should be diffi-
cult for the prosecution, as their ar -
gument is flimsy at best. 
Though, as in all murder trials, 
the prosecution said the same about the defense.
The families of both the defen-
dants and the victim sat through the weeklong trial. 
“It’s a small town, and we all 
know each other in a way ,” said Babette Wood, Bascomb’s younger sister. 
She said the families still greet 
each other around town and offer their prayers to one another for a 
speedy resolution of the case. 
“I wish my brother would’ve 
come home today,” Wood said. “But 
we all wish for closure.”

NASA closer to getting extra space flight
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Carl Paladino said in separate appear -
ances Monday that he stands up for the rights 
of everyone, including gays, but thinks young children shouldn’t be exposed to homosexuality, especially at gay pride parades.
“They wear these little Speedos and they grind 
against each other and it’s just a terrible thing,” Paladino said Monday on NBC’s “Today” show. “Why would you bring your children to that?”
The candidate said he opposes same-sex mar -
riage but would actively recruit gays to his ad-ministration. Mentioning his gay nephew, Pala-dino said the discrimination he and others face is a “very ugly experience.”
The comments by Paladino, who has received 
tea party support, came a day after he told Or -
thodox Jewish leaders he doesn’t want children “brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality” is acceptable.
At Monday’s Columbus Day Parade in Man-
hattan, his Democratic oppo-nent, Attorney General Andrew 
Cuomo, said the comments were 
“reckless and divisive” in light of recent violence. Police say two 
teenage boys and a man were tortured recently in the Bronx because of suspicions they were gay.
Just before the parade began, City Council 
Speaker Christine Quinn said Paladino should 
apologize. Paladino said at the parade that he 
stands up for gays’ rights and abhors anti-gay violence.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, asked to com-
ment on Paladino’s earlier remarks, replied, “It’s not what America stands for, and it’s not what New York stands for, and I won’t dignify it with anything else.”
Paladino’s remarks Sunday came at a syna-
gogue in Brooklyn’s Williamsburg section as he tried to strike a contrast between himself and Cuomo. Paladino said that he chose not to march in this summer’s gay pride parade but that his opponent did.
“That’s not how God created us,” Paladino 
said Sunday of being gay.NY candidate 
Paladino says 
he’d hire gays

UF quarterback John Brantley played with sore ribs and an injured thumb Satur -
day, impressing coach Urban Meyer with his toughness.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
 
John Brantley says his ribs aren’t cracked 
and his thumb isn’t broken, but that doesn’t 
mean Florida’s quarterback — not to mention 
the rest of the team — isn’t battling injury. 
Brantley said his ribs are doing better but 
are still sore, and he experienced some sore-
ness in his throwing arm after altering his 
motion due to the pain in his ribs. 
Still, he felt some of the reports leading up 
to the game with LSU were overblown. 
“I wasn’t limited too much,” Brantley said. 
“I took the reps I needed to take. I wouldn’t really call it limited. Maybe one or two less throws, but I wouldn’t call it limited.”
UF coach Urban Meyer said his quarterback 
proved his toughness when he led the offense down the field on its last drive of the game, connecting with Carl Moore for 51 yards on a third-down play and finding Frankie Ham-mond Jr. for the two-point conversion. 
“That really showed us a lot about who 
Johnny is,” Meyer said. 
Meyer also said guard Jon Halapio (middle 
finger on right hand), who started against the 
Tigers but left the game early, had surgery on 
a finger, and safety Matt Elam and wide re-ceiver Deonte Thompson have concussions. Elam and Thompson did not practice Sun-
day and are considered day-to-day. 
Running back Jeff Demps (foot) is expected 
to return this week after missing Saturday’s contest. 
Meyer, Brantley support Addazio: Gators 
fans showed their disapproval of the play call-
ing at the end of Saturday’s game by booing 
runs up the middle and swing passes on the final offensive drive of the fourth quarter. 
Monday, Meyer was asked if offensive co-
ordinator Steve Addazio, who also coaches the offensive line, is spread too thin consider -
ing the boos and the inconsistent play of the line. 
“I think he’s got a tough job, I think he 
can handle it,” Meyer said. “Obviously, he showed it a year ago and he’s shown it at times this year.”
Meyer said he is also “very involved in the 
offense,” and cited a lack of production in the red zone and lack of big plays as the offense’s biggest problems. 
Brantley also supported Addazio when 
asked if he would prefer to throw the ball Banged-up Gators recovering 
Should Florida’s struggles be a sur -
prise?
Left guard Carl Johnson mulled that 
question over Monday. Finally, he said yes. 
UF’s recent losses should raise eyebrows. He’s heard how this years team is young, but these are still the Gators. And the Gators don’t lose, at least not often.
Inexperience should not be an excuse at 
Florida, Johnson said. And he’s right, but not for the correct reason.
Youth does in fact hinder a football team 
because, unlike in most sports, football play-
ers are not accustomed to performing against 
elite competition before college.
While some high schools become de facto basketball acad-emies with national tournaments, the best football pro-grams are limited to, at most, one out-of-state game. Case in point, last season’s state-champion Palm Beach Gardens Dw-yer High (featuring 
now-UF freshmen Matt Elam, Gerald Chris-tian and Robert Clark) only played in-state 
competition and won by an average of 43 
points.Struggles don’t fall on inexperience

By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer

The Gators’ offensive struggles have 
cost them two consecutive games against 
Southeastern Conference foes this sea-son.
But those woes may soon extend be-
yond the box score.
“If they don’t get things together, it 
could start to have an effect [on recruit-ing],” 2012 wide receiver recruit Latroy Pittman said.
A 6-foot-1 prospect from Citra North 
Marion High, Pittman orally committed to UF on Aug. 18, making him the first member of UF’s 2012 recruiting class. 
The wide receiver was in attendance for the LSU game and said the Gators’ of-fense , which is in its second season under offensive coordinator Steve Addazio, was a hot topic of discussion among many of the recruits in the south end zone Satur -
day.
Pittman said he dis-
cussed the offense with a handful of UF com-mits, including Oviedo 
Hagerty High quar -
terback Jeff Driskel, Groveland South Lake High defensive back 
Nick Waisome, Brooksville Nature Coast High wide receiver Ja’Juan Story and Kirtland (Ohio) Lake Catholic High line-man Chase Hounshell.Play-calling irks recruitsSEE FOOTBALL, p AGE 14

Comparisons: Some have 
started to notice similarities be-
tween this year’s 
UF team and the 
2007 squad that lost four games.
L i n e b a c k e r 
Brandon Hicks be-
lieves that the comparisons are accurate.
“When I came in [2007], every-
thing was passing us by like real 
fast,” he said. “But then again af-
ter a while we started to adjust to it and the game slowed down.”
The 2007 team responded the 
following season with a national championship.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2010
Pryor is the third-
dual threat quar -
terback on the 
list. He sports the 
sixth-best passer 
rating while also managing to run 
for over 300 yards this season. The Ohio State quarterback threw for three touchdowns and 334 yards against Indiana last week to help maintain his strong junior season. If Ohio State can keep winning, Pryor will stay in the running for the trophy.
Despite missing the first game 
of the season, James is second 
in the nation in rushing, first 
among running backs. He leads 
an Oregon offense that is first in the country in scoring with 
7.4 yards a carry. It will be hard to keep him 
off the list if he keeps this pace up.Much like Boise State, some don’t give 
Moore the respect he deserves. But we 
do. Moore has the best passer rating in 
the nation, throwing 14 touchdowns and 
just one interception. The Broncos finally have a shot at making the title game this 
year and Moore has a realistic chance at earning an 
invitation to the Heisman ceremony.Auburn is high up in the rank -
ings and so is Newton. The 
former Gators quarterback has lit up opposing defenses this season. He is second in the nation in passer rating and has thrown and rushed for a 
combined 21 touchdowns. And the fact that he plays SEC defenses week in and week out only helps his cause.Robinson is No. 1 on the list with video 
game-like numbers. He leads the nation in rushing with second place a distant 143 yards behind him. The Michigan quarter -
back is also doing damage with his arm as he owns the 12th-best passer rating. 
Despite throwing three picks against Michigan State last week, we still cannot ignore his stellar statistics. It will take a couple of those games for us to drop him from the list.

Alexander Silva / Alligator Staff
Prep receiver: Brantley needs to ‘let loose’
Pittman didn’t know where to 
begin when describing the Gators’ 
offensive issues but said the play-calling is part of the problem. That isn’t the only cause for the 
Gators’ offense ranking 96th nation-ally, though. According to Pittman, the struggles are a personnel issue as well, citing breakdowns in the of-
fensive line’s blocking and receivers not getting open down the field. He 
added that quarterback John Brant-ley needs to, “let loose” and live up to expectations. 
Despite the offense’s struggles, 
Pittman insists he is 100 percent committed to Florida, though.
“I’m still all Gator, but it leaves 
me with some concerns,” Pittman said. “I understand they lost a great senior class and it’s hard to replace great talent and leadership in one year.”
Other recruits, however, might 
not be so understanding of UF’s of-fensive ineptitude.
According to multiple reports, 
four-star running back Mike Bel-lamy , a Clemson commit, left The Swamp at halftime because the game, and the Gators’ offense was “boring.”
Despite Bellamy’s commit-
ment to Clemson, Florida has had its sights on him. But the offensive woes could take UF out of play for the Punta Gorda Charlotte High star altogether.
And Bellamy wasn’t the only one 
unimpressed with the offense.
According to 247Sports.com, 
four-star tight end A.C. Leonard left UF’s 33-29 loss to LSU disappointed, saying that the game was tough to watch.
The Jacksonville University 
Christian star, who Rivals.com ranks as the No. 4 tight end in the nation, reaffirmed his commitment to UF after the team’s annual Friday Night Lights camp this summer, but  he has since seemingly soured on his commitment.
“Yeah, I guess,” Leonard told 
247Sports.com when asked if he was still orally committed to UF.
Oral commitments are non-binding 
until a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 2RECRUIT , from page 13
But Johnson is right. Youth is not an excuse, because the 
Gators aren’t a young team. 
Against LSU on Saturday, Florida played 28 underclass-
men, good for 46 percent of the Gators who saw the field. By 
comparison, the Tigers played 32 underclassmen, or 53 percent who saw action.
And Saturday was not an outlier. Actually, those percent-
ages (46 and 53) perfectly reflect Florida’s average SEC game 
this season. In all four conference matchups, UF has played 
fewer underclassmen than its opponents.
But UF is perceived as a young team this season because 
it lost so much star power. The Gators lost 11 starters, includ-ing their quarterback (who?), three linebackers, both defensive ends and two best pass catchers. The University of Florida does not have an uncommonly young football team. It just has what we call a “college football team,” which often features a heavy turnover of starters from year to year.
Blaming losses on youth is inaccurate, and it’s not just Mey-
er’s fault. When I sat down to write this story, I actually did so with the intent of proving just how inexperienced Florida was.
But look at the boxscores. Florida was the veteran team 
in every game. Some might argue that age doesn’t matter as much as experience, that Florida losing so many starters from last year has held the team back.
Looking at the number of starters throughout the confer -
ence, though, Florida’s losses are common. The median num-
ber of lost starters in the SEC is 10, just one shy of Florida’s 
damages. Alabama lost 9 starters from its 2009 squad. LSU lost 12.
No matter how you look at it, the Gators aren’t particularly 
young. Productivity, specifically from Florida’s veterans, is a bigger issue. 
The starting quarterback is a fourth-year junior, and he is 
averaging 6.2 yards per attempt. The offensive line features four seniors, and Florida is rushing for 81 fewer yards per game 
than it did last season. Nine of 11 defensive starters are upper -
classmen, yet the unit is surrendering about 8 more points per 
game.
And the Gators have lost one more game than they did all 
of last season. 
Blame whoever you want. Blame the players for not living 
up to their predecessor’s legacies. Blame the coaches for not preparing them to do so. And for those who blame play calling, there’s a Facebook group attacking a certain offensive coordi-
nator just waiting for you. 
But don’t blame the team’s youth.TYLER , from page 13

� McCUMBER SHOT A CAREER LOW 
IN THE SECOND ROUND.

Florida showed why it entered play this 
week ranked No. 1 in the country. 
The Gators are in first place with a 6-under 
total of 554 after 36 holes of play in the Jerry Pate Invitational in Birmingham, Ala. 
Coming off his best performance as a Gator, 
sophomore Tyler McCumber leads the way with a 36-hole total of 135 (-5). McCumber shot 
a then-career-best 68 in the first round at Olym-
pia Fields on Sunday . 
He bettered that number by three strokes 
Monday, carding a bogey-free 65 in his second round to set a new career low. 
“It is great to see Tyler play as well as he is,” 
coach Buddy Alexander said. “He has become 
a really good player for us.”
The Gators had three golfers in the individ-
ual top 10 after the first round but trailed Au-
burn University by three strokes. Following the 
second round, UF golfers accounted for three 
of the top five, putting the UF team in the lead 
and in position for its second consecutive title to start the season.
Continuing his impressive play, senior Bank 
V ongvanij fired a 4-under 66 in the opening round with five birdies to just one bogey. But his consistent play disappeared during the sec-ond 18. 
Vongvanij birdied his first two holes before 
carding an eagle on the par-4 sixth hole. But the 514-yard par-4 tenth hole put a damper on an otherwise excellent day as Vongvanij recorded a quadruple-bogey eight. He went on to make another eagle at 16 but finished with a score of 
71 for a total of 137 (-3), good for fourth indi-
vidually.  
“Bank had kind of an unusual day,” Alexan-
der said. “Usually he is one of our more consis-tent guys, but he still played well.”
In fifth place after Monday’s play with a to-
tal of 138 (-2) is Phillip Choi, who shot a career-
low-tying 68 in round two. Choi dominated 
the front nine carding five birdies and zero bogeys.
Sophomore Tommy Mou shot back-to-back 
rounds of 72 for a 36-hole total of 144 (+4). Mou had seven birdies in his two rounds but also made nine bogeys and a double bogey in his first action this season. 
Andres Echavarria added rounds of 72 and 
73 for the Gators. At one point in his second round Echavarria was 2 under par. But he pro-ceeded to bogey four straight holes and could 
not recover. 
No. 22 Auburn and No. 5 Alabama are 
just two and five shots back, respectively , and 
coach Alexander was pleased with his team’s performance.
“It was a long day, but a good day,” Alexan-
der said. “It was great to see everyone contrib-ute. Everyone did their part.”No. 1 Gators in first

While the UF women’s swim-
ming team emerged victorious 
against Virginia, the men’s squad 
sank, staining the Gators with their first blemish of the season. 
Monday was the Gators’ first 
dual meet of the season as well as 
their first taste of intense compe-
tition, differing from the team’s victory at the All Florida Invita-tional earlier this month. 
The women’s team barely 
squeezed by 2010 Atlantic Coast Conference Champion Virginia with a 150-148 win. The final score was the squad’s tightest fin-
ish in the women’s history since 
their 150-149 win over UCLA in the 1997-98 season. 
“Virginia is a much better team 
than the teams we swam against in the All Florida Invitational,” coach Gregg Troy said.
The women’s squad hasn’t lost 
a season-opening dual meet since 
UF sanctioned women’s swim-
ming in 1972. 
Contributing to Florida’s tight 
victory was junior Teresa Crip-
pen, who nabbed second place 
in the 200-yard butterfly, edging sister and Virginia team captain Claire Crippen, who finished fourth. 
Crippen also secured second 
place in the 200 individual med-ley and 1,000 freestyle. Fellow junior Shara Stafford also had 
a successful meet, earning first 
place in the 100 backstroke, sec-ond in the 100 fly and third in the 
50 free. Freshman Elizabeth Bei-
sel was the points leader for the women, grabbing victories in the 200 backstroke and 200 individu-
al medley. 
Beisel explained that this meet was more difficult than the last as the team is in the midst of one of 
their intense training cycles. Sat-urday, the team worked out for four hours while it also trained 
Monday morning before the 
meet.“We’re pretty tired right now,” 
Beisel said. “But now we can be confident that, even if we’re tired, we can perform well.” 
The men’s squad had a more 
difficult meet, falling in a 153-145 loss to the Cavaliers. Though, the Gators were short four All-Americans due to international competition.
Senior Conor Dwyer led the 
men in points, placing first in the 100 and 200 free, and 200 indi-vidual medley. Senior Logan Sto-
rie collaborated with sophomore 
Scott Sommer, junior Jeffrey Ray-mond and senior Balazs Gercsak to snag the top finish in the final event of the meet, the 400 free-
style relay. 
With more than two weeks 
until their next competition, Dw-
yer, the reigning 2010 NCAA 
Male Swimmer of the Year, said 
the team would be concentrating on pushing through its rigorous training cycle. 
“It’s starting to get intense,” 
Dwyer said. “We’ve been train-ing hard in the pool and in the weight room.”
The Gators’ next matchup will 
be the team’s Southeastern Con-ference opener and first away meet against rival Georgia on Oct. 29.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2010
