shop, sponsored by the student group H.O.T. Clay, was open to the public. Hill is an assistant professor of 
ceramics at the University of Montana and, according to his website, uses anatomical fragments in his work to seduce the senses while exploring what makes us human.
� HE RECEIVED 63 PERCENT OF THE VOTE.

It’s not often that a 22-year-old law student decides to 
run for public office and actually wins. But Bryan Griffin 
defied the odds Tuesday night. 
Griffin was elected to the Alachua County Soil and Wa-
ter Conservation District, which is responsible for imple-
menting strategies to preserving resources in the county. 
Griffin received 32,166 votes, or 63 percent while his 
opponent, Santa Fe College student Brian Bunch, received 18,484 votes, 36 percent.
He said he raised $1,300 through the support of people 
who believed in his abilities and vision. 
Griffin said his goals are to keep regulations minimal 
while using local innovation to provide comprehensive so-lutions to encourage best-use soil and water practices. 
Griffin, former chairman of UF College Republicans, 
said he has always had a desire to positively affect his com-munity and improve the lives of his fellow citizens. 
“The fact that I won shows that people want to use cit-
izen-based bottom-up innovation to tackle local conserva-tion issues,” Griffin said. “It’s a local cooperative solution 
as opposed to a large government solution.” 
Griffin’s long-term goal is to be a responsible member 
of the board and serve the community to the best of his 
ability.  
“This victory has humbled me, and it’s an honor to be 
elected by the citizens to serve in this capacity,” Griffin said.  
When asked about future plans in politics, Griffin said 
in 10 years he would like to run for state legislature.
“The legislature can have the largest impact on the qual-
ity of a citizen’s life because it deals with enacting or some-times simplifying laws and regulations,” he said. Student wins

STATE POLITICS
By MINA RADMAN
Alligator Writer
Republican Rick Scott declared vic-
tory shortly after Democrat Alex Sink conceded the governor’s race Wednes-day morning, and the UF community has differing opinions on the tight win.
“Scott’s victory is going to usher in a 
very conservative administration and is 
going to be tied to a very conservative 
House and Senate leadership,” said po-litical science professor Daniel Smith. 
Scott, a 57-year-old former health 
care executive, will become the state’s first self-financed governor. He poured over $73 million of his own money into his candidacy, which sprang out of no-where in April. He also spent $53.3 mil-
lion to win the primary against state at-torney general Bill McCollum.
“The race was close enough that it 
almost had to be recounted,” said UF 
College Democrats President Kristin Klein. “It shows that money is a really important part of elections.”
Sink, the state’s 
chief financial offi-cer, entered the 75-day general-election 
campaign with a 
seven point lead in 
the polls. However, 
her initial popularity was not enough to counteract growing 
Republican support.
“Rick Scott tapped into the anti-
Obama sentiment,” Smith said. “Even 
though Alex Sink polled much better than fellow Democrats in statewide 
races, she wasn’t able to overcome the enthusiasm gap the Republicans have.”
Sink won Alachua County with 59 
percent to Scott’s 37 percent. 
Both the UF College Democrats 
and Republicans organizations were proud of Tuesday’s turnout. Klein said more than 700 people voted in the Reitz Union Ballroom on Tuesday . 
UF College Republicans President 
Carly Wilson attributed the high turn-out partly to the Republicans’ various efforts, which included signs, phone banks and dropping literature door to 
door. She sees a bright future ahead. 
“We will show what we can do for 
the state and country , which will be 
reflected in the 2012 elections,” Wilson said.UF reacts to Scott victory

UF will be teaching more teachers, thanks to a new pro-
gram. 
UF joined the Science and Mathematics Teacher Imperative, 
a national initiative committed to preparing a higher number 
of quality high school math and science teachers. 
The Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the 
nation’s oldest higher education association, began SMTI in late 2008. SMTI currently includes 125 institutions and 12 uni-versities; UF joined in early October.  
Tom Dana, associate dean for academic affairs at the Col-lege of Education and UF’s liaison to SMTI, said a good teacher would push students to pursue research and innovation. Stu-dents, in turn, will produce inventions such as “the new Google or Facebook” that ultimately drive the U.S. economy.  
“[SMTI] is a great way to bring the resources of a great re-
search university to solving problems in our society by having better math and science teachers,” Dana said. 
UF Teach program allows students to major in math and 
science while pursuing an education minor.  
Currently about 160 students are enrolled in math and sci-
ence education classes since the program started a year ago.   UF to train teachers as part of national program

The Gators are trying for an-
other national championship.
Members of the Gator Cricket Club will take the pitch this weekend in the American Col-
lege Cricket’s Southeast Cham-
pionship. 
The club will compete against 
six schools — University of Cen-tral Florida, University of Miami, Florida International University , University of South Florida, Uni-versity of Tampa and Auburn University — at Central Bro-
ward Regional Park,    3700 NW 
11th Place in Lauderhill, in three or four matches from Friday to Sunday. The top four teams will advance to the national champi-onship in March.
Cricket, known as “the 
gentleman’s sport,” is usually played as a one-day , five-day 
or Twenty20 match. Pillarisetty 
said this tournament will feature Twenty20 games, each lasting about three to four hours, half the length of a one-day game.
“It used be a gentleman’s 
sport when it was played over five days with tea breaks,” he said. “But with Twenty20, it’s war.”
The team is using money 
from RecSports and money it raised in a co-ed cricket tourna-ment Oct. 8 and 17. American College Cricket helped pay for the team’s equipment and uni-forms.
The club is 
composed of un-dergraduate, grad-
uate and doctoral 
students from India, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, England and the Caribbean. There are no Ameri-cans on the club.
Lloyd Jodah, president of  
American College Cricket, be-lieves the team will do well in the tournament. 
“I know how important 
sport is to the Gators,” he said. “I could see the school putting a lot of support behind the cricket team in years to come.”Cricket club hopes

The Inter-Residence Hall Association 
will be hosting its first Tunnel of Oppres-
sion at Broward Hall on Thursday from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
The event, which starts in Broward’s 
lobby, will address topics such as immi-gration, religion, slavery , genocide, sexual orientation and self-image.
These themes will be presented in vi-
sual and sensory detail as guides lead groups of about eight students through the rooms. 
At the end of the tour, there is a room 
where a counselor will be available to talk 
to students about what they have seen.
“It is a diversity event to break down 
barriers between people who experience 
oppression every day and 
those who never experience it,” said Jimmy McClellan, the project’s director. 
The tunnel will be in Broward’s base-
ment, featuring seven rooms, each with a different theme illustrated by graphic im-ages and actors. 
Actors will interact with each other 
and with group members in an attempt to evoke a  mindset that shows how it’d be if they were a different person. 
Altogether, the tunnel should take 
about 45 minutes to complete. 
Sakina Sackaloo, the IRHA vice presi-
dent, learned of the program at a confer -
ence and believes it could be a real eye-opener. 
“Instead of just reading about it, it puts 
you in the place of the oppressor or the op-pressed,” she said.

Just in time for No-Shave November, 
a new study shows that UF is one of the 
hairiest universities in the nation. 
The study was performed by Schick in 
partnership with the research company Sperling’s BestPlaces at 60 universities na-
tionwide.
 The more clean-shaven men on cam-
pus, the higher a school ranks.
The study, the Schick Hydro Hairi-
est Colleges Study, shows UF is among the lowest-ranked schools in the country, ranking 55th. 
“Gainesville is beard rock city,” said 
Will Dueease, 23, who sports a brown beard and plays in the local band Green-land Is Melting. “This is where Against 
Me! and all those folk-punk bands got 
started.” 
The only campuses with more facial 
hair were, in order, American University, Georgetown University, University of 
South Florida, Harvard University and Rutgers. 
UF engineering student Mike Mazer 
said he was surprised Harvard was the second-hairiest school in the nation.
“They must have a ‘I’ve-been-studying-
law-for-five-days-and-didn’t-have-time-
to-shave’ kind of beard,” he said. “I’m sure 
their beard is more of an academic conse-
quence and less of something stylistic. At least I hope so.” 
Mazer is another one of those who 
contributes to Florida’s low clean-shaven 
score. 
“I think I carry a beard well,” he said. 
“I’d say it makes me look rugged and 
manly.”
Researchers gathered the data by stand-
ing at a street corner at the 60 universities and observed 200 men walking past.
 If any of the men they saw had a beard 
or mustache, or both, they would be count-
ed against the university’s ranking. 
The researchers also asked 50 men at 
each school how often they shaved. 
According to the study, southern school 
students tended to be more clean-shaven, and northeast city school students tended to 
have more facial hair. 
The five most clean-shaven were Texas 
Tech, James Madison, the University of 
Virginia, Yale and Penn State.
The study also showed that clean-shav-
en men are more likely to have higher sala-ries and more attractive significant others.
While the benefits of being clean-shav-
en for job interviews aren’t particularly up 
for debate by those with beards, the bene-
fits in the ladies department are less clear. 
Dueease said that one of the reasons he 
has maintained a beard is because his girl-
friend likes it.
“Why does any guy do anything?” he asked. “It’s cause girls like it. I found that I 
looked good with a beard, according to the girls I was going after, so it stuck.”
Anthropology major Sarah Hinkes, 20, 
said she was more likely to be attracted to men with beards than clean-shaven men. 
“Beards are the stuff of men,” she said. 
“Only real men can grow beards. The ones who don’t are just little girls. No-shave November is my favorite month.” 
Kristen Troxler, a 19-year-old nursing 
student, disagreed. 
“I feel like [the beardless] tend to look 
like a more put-together person in gen-eral,” she said. “Someone who’s more in control, on top of things.” 
The rankings are part of a promotion 
for the Schick Hydro razor, and the com-pany plans to stage “Hydroventions” for particularly hairy students.
Students can nominate their friends 
with beards on the Schick Hydro Experi-ence Facebook page. Four winners will be selected to receive a visit from a team of nurses who will give them a shave, which 
will be videotaped for Schick Hydro’s Fa-
cebook website and YouTube page. They will also win a free, two-person Spring Break vacation.Razor company ranks UF as one of nation’s hairiest

Students went shopping for de-
grees  Wednesday. 
Students spoke to representa-
tives from the different UF colleg-
es at the Reitz Union Colonnade 
at the third annual Majors Fair, 
which was hosted by Student Gov-ernment.
The fair provided students with 
the opportunity to explore a vari-
ety of majors and visit more than 
40 tables that were set up, repre-senting 37 different academic de-partments. 
“A lot of freshmen, sophomores 
and even juniors have yet to actu-ally pick a major, and it’s really tough to find out firsthand infor -
mation about the various majors,” 
said Rajiv Asnani, SG director of 
Academic Affairs. 
Students were able to speak to 
faculty, professors and students in 
the different majors to help them 
make informed decisions about the options available for them. 
The Career Resource Center was 
on hand for students concerned 
with the post-college opportunities 
of certain degrees.
Asnani said he estimated at least 
300 to 400 students came through 
the fair throughout the day. 
“It’s beneficial for students to 
attend,” said Angel Iverson, as-
sistant director for Career Events at CRC. “Even if they think they 
already know what their major 
might be, there are still always oth-er options out there that suit them better. They get to have all these 
majors at their fingertips.”Students explore UF majors at ReitzIRHA tunnel

Members of the Superfund 
Art Project team will address the 
Cabot Carbon/Koppers Super -
fund Site issue Saturday and Sun-
day during the Downtown Festi-val and Art Show in Gainesville.
The project, which is part of 
the Protect Gainesville’s Citizens nonprofit corporation, grew out of the “Picturing Ecology” ex-hibit. The exhibit addressed the 
issues at the site through art such 
as drawing, painting, photogra-phy and video. Anthony Castron-ovo, the SAP co-chair, directed the exhibit last spring.
Castronovo, who also works 
as a part-time professor at Santa Fe College and UF, taught the course “Art and Ecology” last 
spring at UF. 
He said the class had dis-
cussed several different options 
for a project, but everyone chose the topic on the Cabot Carbon/
Koppers Superfund Site.
“Part of my push for the class 
was to look at the local ecology, 
and immediately Koppers came 
up as something of an interest,” 
Castronovo said.
He said the biggest challenge 
of the project was to interpret the numerous statistics and data that are offered about the site and cre-ate art out of it that could actu-ally transmit a comprehensible 
message.
“It’s overwhelming how much 
information there is. It’s hard to 
make sense of it all,” Castronovo 
said.According to the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s Pro-
posed Cleanup Plan, released in 
July, the site originally existed as 
two separate regions: the Cabot Carbon, which is located in the southeast region of the site, and 
Koppers, which is located in the 
west region of the site. 
The roots of the water and 
soil contamination problems for the city started in 1911 in the 
Cabot Carbon portion, when it 
began operating as a pine tar and charcoal generation facility. The problems in the Koppers portion 
began in 1916 when its wood-op-
erating facilities began creosote impregnation processes, accord-ing to the cleanup plan.
However, it wasn’t until the 
1980s that the site was put on the National Priorities List, accord-ing to the document.
Since then, cleanup processes 
have been underway in order to try and stop the soil and water contamination that is directly linked to the facilities’ operations, according to the cleanup plan.
In 1990, the identified con-
taminants of concern, which in-clude such hazardous waste as arsenic, phenols and creosote, 
were reported to be only in the 
Hawthorn Group and the surfi-cial aquifer. Creosote consists of 
compounds that are both carcino-
genic and non-carcinogenic.
However, according to the 
USEPA plan, more recent inves-tigations have indicated that the 
COCs were also present in the 
Upper Floridan Aquifer.
The Murphree Wellfield, which is operated by Gainesville Regional Utilities, provides the public water supply for 
Gainesville by withdrawing wa-
ter from the aquifer.
James Jawitz, an associate pro-
fessor of environmental hydrol-
ogy at UF, said he remembers his 
visit to the site in 1995 and the circumstances that existed then.
“The ditch in the side of the 
road [on Main Street] had an oily 
sheen from the site,” Jawitz said. 
“You would walk around and smell the contaminants in the water.”
He said that an important part 
of examining and solving the is-sue is looking at who is driving the process.“Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties has rattled the cage, and they 
even got U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson in-
volved,” Jawitz said.
He said that both the residents’ 
and the operating facilities’ argu-ments are plausible but added 
that they will have to meet some-
where in the middle. He said the main question isn’t whether everyone wants zero contamina-
tion but rather what the costs and 
benefits would be of a plan that asks for an even higher degree of safety.
“What no one has agreement 
on is how much above the zero contamination is acceptable,” Jawitz said.
He added that there is no cur -
rent risk from drinking the water since GRU has to treat the wa-ter and make sure it’s safe be-fore distributing it to the public. Jawitz also said the residents of 
Gainesville have already paid a 
lot of money to manage a prob-lem they haven’t caused.
Even though the issue has been 
a cause for concern in Gainesville 
for years, many UF students who 
are transient to the community aren’t aware of the issue. 
Mina Quraishy, a first-year 
health science major at UF, said she has never heard about the problem. She said she would probably read about the site if a shorter, less tedious version of 
the cleanup plan existed.
“UF students make up a large 
population of Gainesville so, to 
some extent, UF is responsible to, 
if not act on it, at least advocate 
the issue and make us aware of it,” Quraishy said.

Today’s question: If block tuition is implemented, will you take more credits?
169 TOTAL VOTES43% YES57% NOWednesday’s question: Are you happy with the election results?Block the block
Proposed tuition change 
is unfair for students
Imagine going to a coffee shop, ordering your typical 12-ounce latte and being charged for a 20-ounce drink. The shop doesn’t have room to hold any more wasteful small  
cups, and the large, which costs a good deal more, will lead to higher profits for the premier coffee institution. 
Complaints from parched Gators in need of just a small 
12-ounce shot of caffeine, who really just don’t have time to drink an entire 20-ounce latte with all their extracurricular ac-tivities and trying to juggle work, will just have to wastfully throw the extra 8 ounces out. 
The coffee company has received many complaints and 
pleas to let its customers buy the Tall mochas, but the com-plaints have fallen on deaf ears. The coffee giant just doesn’t care what any of its customers say.
But don’t expect these new rules to be seen anywhere else 
in the state. Nope, you can buy a regular, Tall 12-ounce mac-chiato anywhere else in the country without the pressure of buying the 20-ounce coffee. But here in Gainesville, 12 ounces just isn’t an option. 
The coffee company is at the top of its game in Gainesville, 
and many other grateful Floridians would be happy to drink its coffee if current Gators don’t want to purchase the Venti drink. 
Any ungrateful Gator can go somewhere else. This is just 
the way it is now. 
There are thousands of other people who will gladly take 
your place in line to pay $7.64 for an oversized coffee that even they probably don’t have time to drink or want to drink. 
We’re totally kidding about this whole Starbucks scenario, 
by the way. You can still wait in a line 30 people deep and fork over an unnecessary amount of money for any sized coffee-ish drink you want. But this scenario is very real for UF students who might face a similar situation come next year. 
The Florida Board of Governors, the Florida bigwigs 
who oversee the state university system, have convened in Gainesville to vote today on whether or not universities can charge students block tuition. Block tuition would charge a flat-rate fee analogous to 15 credits for full-time students re-gardless if they take 12, 15 or 18 credits.
And while the plan sounds marvelous for those over -
achievers who take 16 to 18 credits, we know of maybe seven people who actually do that to themselves. 
The rest of us, if the Board of Governors votes to approve 
block tuition, which it’s looking like they will, will be forced 
to pay for classes we aren’t taking. That is unless you take 
the university’s not-so-subtle hint that it wants you to get the 
heck out of here and take the 15 credits you probably don’t have time for. 
We might be biased as members of the Editorial Board, 
who somehow manage a full-time student schedule with es-
sentially full-time jobs providing all your smiling faces with 
news every day to read on the bus, but implementing a sys-tem that would pressure students to take on a bigger course load than they can handle just won’t bode well for our jobs 
and resume-building activities. 
The Board of Governors should listen to the students this 
policy will affect, the students who have resoundingly united 
in opposition against such a grossly misguided plan and the students who don’t want to be charged for a Venti when all we want is a tall. 
The Board of Governors should vote against block tuition.
Entertainers just aren’t entertaining
A friend of mine was required to watch “Singing 
in the Rain” for a class last week. She, like all blue-blooded Americans who have anything re-
motely close to a heart, loved the movie that tells the whimsical, fictitious story of the first talking movies. This prompted me to look up some of the singing and dancing numbers from the film. As I browsed through 
“Make ‘em Laugh,” “Singing in the Rain,” etc., I real-
ized something: We settle for some sorry excuses for pop stars these days. 
One viewing of the “Make ‘em Laugh” routine could 
probably convince the most staunch GaGa-ite that Don-
ald O’Connor has more talent in his big toe than an 
army of Justin Biebers. In just one scene O’Connor plays piano, dances, sings and performs a grueling physical routine all while being hysterically funny. What’s even 
more impressive is that O’Connor was so committed to 
his act that after shooting this scene, he was prescribed three days bed rest by the hospital he was admitted to for extreme exhaustion. I’d like to see the Jonas Brothers perform such a feat.
What I’m getting at is this: When did we stop expect-
ing our entertainers to be entertaining? 
Today we settle for pop stars who sport the kind of 
manufactured talent that somehow allows girls who 
can’t sing a note to be played on the radio 24/7 (Ke$ha, 
I’m looking at you). 
I like the quality of studio sound, and I appreciate 
the catchiness of some of the songs that are on a five-song loop on 105.3 FM every minute of every day, 
but didn’t there used to be something more to being 
an entertainer? Through the advancement of media, artists have more exposure than ever before or previ-ously imagined, yet no one is quite the sensation The Beatles were in the ‘60s. With autotune and other 
countless audio effects, an off note 
is all but never heard, yet no one has the same engaging 
quality of voice that holds you spellbound through Etta James’ “At Last.” 
Maybe I’m just a snob, but I think watching guys like 
Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire perform marvelously in-tricate tap-dancing routines while singing is far more impressive than seeing Drake wander around a stage while just kind of saying lyrics and shaking his hand at 
the crowd.
“But Nate,” you might say, “what about things like 
High School Musical, where people sing and dance re-
ally well?” Well, that’s totally different. Movies and 
shows like HSM star Disney drones who, while having 
no real personality, are made to appear talented through heavily choreographed dance routines that appear more difficult than they are.
Yes, I hate to break it to you, but Demi Lovato, Sele-
na Gomez and the like probably don’t possess the vocal talents they appear to.
Am I saying talent is dead? No, there are plenty of 
talented artists on the scene today. Is there any way we 
can somehow go back to the way things were? Probably 
not. 
What I want is not for all the pop stars to disappear. 
I just want to see them rise to the occasion and attain the same level of entertainment we had 20, 30 and 50 
years ago.

Columnist presents a flawed view of 
WikiLeaks
Wednesday’s guest column by Stephen 
Bartholomew from the University of Toledo 
on the justification of WikiLeaks’ releases is 
ridiculous. 
I  realize these leaks are seen as valuable 
for keeping our government responsible for 
war crimes, but the harm these leaks cause  
is far more damaging than its benefits are 
helpful. 
Frankly, no one is holding anyone ac-
countable for these war crimes, and that’s unfortunate. 
However, it’s pretty hard to affect change 
when only 41 percent of eligible voters actu-ally vote in the U.S.
Beyond that fact, war isn’t pretty.
I don’t want anyone being taken advan-
tage of, but at the end of the day it’s not a 
perfect world.
Pardon my cynicism, but anyone who 
can applaud Julian Assange as a “champion 
of truth and democracy” has clearly been 
munching on rainbows and butterflies for the past several months. 
Reality check behind the leaks: Our for -
eign informants are being murdered over them, and your safety is at risk because of your beloved “champion.” 
Enjoy that truth and democracy when 
that threat finally finds your hometown one 
of these days.

It’s a sad day for music lovers. A huge force in the indus-
try has fallen.
Like so many more before it, and after years of inves-
tigation, file sharing and peer-to-peer network LimeWire has 
been ordered to be shut down after a ruling Tuesday by a federal judge.
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood of New York issued the 
permanent injunction, stating LimeWire must disable the “searching, downloading, uploading, file trading, and/or file distribution functionality” of its website.
The site must also inform its workers, investors and cus-
tomers of the injunction — as well as file a progress report to 
Wood within 14 days to make sure all conditions are being 
met. 
When visiting LimeWire’s homepage, I was met with the 
following: “This is an official notice that LimeWire is under 
a court-ordered injunction to stop distributing and support-
ing its file-sharing software. Downloading or sharing copy-
righted content without authorization is illegal.”
The Recording Industry Association of America said in a 
statement the injunction “will start to unwind the massive 
piracy machine that LimeWire and [founder and Chairman 
Mark] Gorton used to enrich themselves immensely,” ac-
cording to The New York Times.
This move follows the pattern of other popular peer-to-
peer sites such as Napster, Grokster and Kazaa being sued 
and eventually shut down because of file sharing.
The RIAA can make statements all it wants about how it 
will start to end piracy with this new injunction, but its state-
ment is about as similar as people claiming they are going to end world hunger by sending one french fry to each starving 
person in the world.
Sure it helps for now, but soon everyone will be starv-
ing again. LimeWire formed in 2000, one year before Napster 
— easily the most recognized file sharing site — received its injunction to shut down in 2001.
When one falls, another will rise.
Even though LimeWire received its injunction Tuesday, that doesn’t mean the case is necessar -
ily over.
LimeWire chief executive George 
Searle said the injunction only applied 
to LimeWire’s file-sharing product. “Our company remains 
open for business,” Searle explains.
He also says the company is deeply committed to work-
ing with the music industry.
LimeWire and the RIAA will appear before Judge Wood 
in January to begin arguments on damages LimeWire will pay.
When Kazaa was shut down, a settlement was reached at 
$100 million.
That would buy a lot of CDs.While it’s obvious to understand why the RIAA is coming 
down so hard on these sites — users are effectively stealing 
music — it seems as if their struggle is futile.
Similarly, back in the early to mid 2000s, when teenagers 
and housewives were being sued for ludicrous amounts of 
money for the handful of songs they downloaded illegally to help prove some point, it quickly ended because it became 
too expensive and time-consuming to handle all of those 
lawsuits.
If the RIAA plans to bring down every single file-sharing 
website, it has a lot of work to do. Knowing how expensive 
lawsuits are, I’d be surprised if the RIAA didn’t start losing 
more money than it made on its quest to bring down online 
piracy.
I personally quit using LimeWire about a year ago and 
moved onto BitTorrent and Pirate Bay (another site deal-
ing with legal issues). No matter how many of these sites 
are shut down, others will form to take their place. It’s just a 
never-ending cycle the music industry will have to learn to 
understand.
Besides, what was it we learned in elementary school 
growing up?
Sharing is caring — it can be fun!

Challenge:  Could you bear your hair for No-Shave November?
  By MARISSA PRIETO
 avenue contributing writer
 
  No-Shave November. Novembeard. Call 
it what you want, but the time is upon us. 
For one month, men and women across the nation will ditch their Gillette and Venus ra-zors to let the natural beauty ﬂ  ow from their 
faces, legs and any other optional body part. 
Some do it for the cause. Some do it for the challenge. The rules are simple: Go natural for November.
  This year, the Avenue wanted an inside 
look into the hairy ambitions of No-Shave November partakers, so we’re following two UF students who are kissing their shav-ing cream goodbye for the entire month. By 
Nov. 30th, their faces will look like Robin Wil-liams’ knuckles — and they’re OK with that.The two No-Shave November insiders will blog 
about their monthlong journey. Read on to learn about these brave souls, who have de-cided to grow out a food trap and potentially 
risk their sex lives in the spirit of the challenge. 
Then follow-up on their mustached missions throughout the month at www.avenuechal-
lenge.wordpress.com.
THE PARTAKERS
  Danny Ramos, 20
Ramos, a 20-year-old 
political science major, is 
no newbie when it comes 
to No-Shave November. This year will be his 
second time going sans razor. Last year, he 
participated just for fun and ended up grow-ing a beard from December to May.
  He said that so many people approached 
him about his beard, he decided to grow it out for Invisible Children, a movement dedicated to helping children in Uganda, this year. He 
said this will give him an opportunity to raise 
awareness about an issue that’s important to him. 
Ramos said he thinks beards are tough 
and that all the great, rugged men in history, 
including all of the greatest presidents, have 
had beards (think Rutherford B. Hayes). His deﬁ  nition of a manly man is someone with a big, strong jaw line, a ﬂ  annel jacket, a beard 
and probably some sort of ax.
  Ramos has one word for ﬁ  rst-timers: “Per-
severe.” au naturale

listenclickhearBy Melinda Carstensen Let’s joke about sex
      Dear Jared,
  My boyfriend is a typical jokester, and 
most of the time, it’s my favorite qual-ity about him. He always knows exactly what to say to make me laugh, and it’s 
not something I want to call a problem 
— except I think it’s getting a little out of hand. It kind of puts a buzzkill on the romance when all he does is joke, but you can’t exactly ask your boyfriend to stop being funny. How can I nicely let him know I want him to be a little more seri-ous (sometimes) without him feeling like I’m asking him to change his entire per-
sonality for me?
  Sincerely,
  LOL STFU
Being so partial to OMGROFL com-
edy myself, this is a tough ques-
tion. But it’s also a question in 
which you’re not alone. There’s a ﬁ  ne 
line between making dead-grandma jokes at your nana’s funeral and making 
you cough up Diet Sprite at Applebee’s 
with dead-grandma jokes a few months 
down the road. 
  And it’s a difﬁ  cult conversation to have 
with someone who makes you laugh even 
while slapping your ass and jokingly mak-
ing you call him “Sally.” 
  Or is that one of those times when it’s 
a buzzkill?   This looks 
like a situation where we’ll have to weigh the pros and cons of the relationship to-gether. Does his 
inability to ever 
be serious affect your relationship so greatly that you 
just can’t deal with it anymore? Is that the only bad quality about him? Who’s getting the last laugh?
  We all have our bad qualities. Some 
of us curse like a felon. Some of us listen 
to Ke$ha. And some of us drink directly 
from the OJ carton while scratching our asses with the fridge wide open.
  Laughter, as they say, honey, is the 
best medicine, and I can see his afﬁ  nity for laughter all around is one of the things that attracted you to him from the start. 
  If making you laugh is his worst qual-
ity, consider yourself lucky. And if it’s be-
come too much for you, mention it to him. 
Make the hard-to-have conversation into a quasi-serious pun. Speak his language, and maybe both of you will LMAO all the way home.
Have a question for our resident sex-
pert? Send Jared an e-mail at Jmisner@alligator.org. Your name will not appear in print or online.      sex and the swamp 
 Megamind
 Like history, Hollywood likes to repeat 
itself — which means a lot of movies 
are produced about superheroes and blue 
aliens. Yet despite the redundancy (“Avatar” and “The 
Incredibles,” for starters), audiences seem to eat it up 
— especially when megastar voiceovers are involved. 
With all of the above, including said megastars Brad Pitt (who mans the voice of a Mr. Incredible look-alike), Will Ferrell (a villain-gone-good with a bulging forehead — a “mega”-mind, get it?), Tina Fey and Jonah Hill, “Megamind” should prove to be no different. Throw in some 3-D action, “Toy Story”-like humor and DreamWorks’ style, and you’ve got a ﬁ  lm that’ll appeal as much to your little brother as to your 
grandmother.
Runaway
 After just one week of being online, 
Kanye West’s nearly 35-minute, epic 
short ﬁ  lm has more than 3 million views 
on YouTube. Following in the footsteps of the late Mi-
chael Jackson, whose “Thriller” video is said to have 
inﬂ  uenced “Runaway,” West shows off his artistic side 
with this elaborate depiction of a phoenix fallen from earth (an environmentalist promo?), a gargantuan ﬂ  aming ball that crashes into earth (the apocalypse?) and other miscellaneous, WTF moments. Regardless of the cryptic metaphors, West is at the top of his game lyrically and musically, trying his hand at singing and getting some help along the way from Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Pusha T and Bon Iver. We R Who We R
 Some may hate on Ke$ha for 
her sloppy party-girl lyrics and her — ahem — excessive use of 
glitter, but let’s give the girl who wakes up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy some credit. Even 
those who don’t care for the messy-haired song-
stress can’t deny she knows how to belt out silly, catchy pop tunes. In “We R Who We R,” the ﬁ  rst single off her upcoming EP “Cannibal,” the dirty-blonde rebel growls out her usual brand of lyrical gems —  “And no you don’t wanna mess with us, got Jesus on my necklace” —  creating a club jam you can’t help but dance to (or at least laugh at).  
 Downtown Festival 
and Art Show
This weekend, head downtown 
to the Bo Diddley Community Plaza to see work created by more than 250 different artists, hear music from local bands and solo artists, watch performances by different dance groups and chow 
down on food from more than 20 vendors. The 
29th annual festival, which is hosted by the City of Gainesville Department of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs, will be held Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days.

 Feeling fruity? Course is a sweet pick for spring schedules
  By ALLISON BANKO
 avenue writer
 
  It’s breathing in your ear, ﬂ  ashing in the 
back of your mind and cowering over your 
shoulder. Spring registration kicked off this week, and ISIS has become the new Facebook in your hunt for a ﬂ  awless batch of courses. 
Among the massive mess of course listings 
nuzzles a one-credit course that’s extra sweet: Growing Fruit for Fun and Proﬁ  t (FRC1010).
  This lecture-based course is offered by UF’s 
Horticultural Sciences Department, but it’s de-
signed for non-horticulture majors looking to 
sink their teeth into the world of fruit produc-tion. Rooted with no exams, no homework and fruit sampling, the course provides a light twist 
on spring schedules.
  Alyssa Cho, a current UF Ph.D. student in 
agronomy, holds a master’s degree from the 
Horticultural Sciences Department and taught 
the course last spring. 
  “It’s a pretty fun, laid-back class,” she said. 
“Students should take it if they have any inter-
est about where their food comes from.”
  The course is only offered during the spring 
semester and features lectures from experts, including UF faculty, on the fruit chosen for the day’s focus. The spotlighted fruit is partnered with tasty samples for the students. Lectures 
include strawberries, oranges, apples, blue-
berries and peaches.   “We have focused on what you can grow in 
Florida,” Cho said.
  While students learn the properties of 
fruits, the semester’s schedule also includes informative lectures centered on organic farm-
ing and tips students can implement into their daily lives. 
  Caitlyn Oser, a communi-
cative disorders senior who 
took the course in 2009, 
said she still appreciates 
the relevancy of the course — especially when she’s digging through the produce section at 
the supermarket. 
  “They taught us about the ripeness of fruits,” she said. “Now I’m able to look closer at that when I’m shopping for them at the gro-
cery store.”
  While the students enjoy their juicy snacks, 
they also must take notes during lectures, as 
grades are based 50 percent on a notebook 
that is collected at the end of the semester.
  Academics support coordinator for the Hor-
ticultural Sciences Department, Curtis Smyder, said he has never heard any negative feedback 
from students who have taken the class.
  “A lot of folks take it just to have something 
different,” he said.
“Everyone seems to enjoy it, even folks that 
have no intention of going into the agriculture 
ﬁ  eld. It’s a really fun class.” By KAT BEIN

This Friday, Gainesville is getting a dose of 
one of Asheville, N.C.’s most up-and-coming 
rock forces, Papadosio, who have dedicated 
themselves to reinventing the jam band.
The five-member group has been touring 
the country for the past four years, rocking festivals with their unique blend of tradition-
al guitar-based rock ’n’ roll and synth-laden 
electronica.
Their mission: “To combine eclectic musi-
cal traditions with modern Electronica to stir 
the heart and fuel the mind,” according to a 
statement from the band.
“They are a jam band, but they’re a new 
style of jam,” said Charlie Bilsker, a coordi-nator for the event, who first saw Papadosio 
play at the Aura Music Festival in January. 
“They’re the type of band in which every per -
son can find something they like.”
Papadosio comes with everything you’d 
expect in a jam band: guitar, bass, drums and vocals.
But they add to it lines of synths, se -
quencers and samples to give it a danceable rhythm. The result? A more club-ready feel 
than the usual meandering Deadhead type 
of set.
And their influences are numerous, in-cluding everything from rock to house to jazz. 
The band also sites influences from hip-hop 
to dub, a reggae-flavored electronica. 
“Every song has a unique approach to at-
taining originality,” the statement says.
Bilsker adds: “They’re extremely captivat-
ing and versatile in their live sets. They have a great blend.”
Opening for Papadosio are a variety of 
Gainesville talents to match the influences of the headliner. DJ Ruby and JeRK will open, spinning everything from hip-hop to electro 
to dubstep, followed by a performance by lo-
cal jam-rockers J2K.
The show kicks off at 9 p.m. Friday at 
The Venue nightclub, 233 W. University Ave. Tickets are $10 at the door or $8 on presale 
through the event’s Facebook page.
“This is a do-not-miss opportunity,” Bil-
sker said. “This is Papadosio’s first show in 
Florida since January, and they’re coming to 
blow minds.”thursday, november 4, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11 10, ALLIGATOR � thursday, november 4, 2010
The art of shopping: New store features fashion, gallery 
By KATHLEEN BOYLE
avenue contributing writer
Tucked in a darling two-story corner building at 
101 N. Main St., an area known for nightlife and lo-
cal dives, the marriage of art and fashion is alive 
and thriving.
It’s Gifthorse, the latest creation of Roberto 
Evans. The 27-year-old entrepreneur and artist has been carving a niche for artistic force in the 
Gainesville community since 2008.
This downtown addition, which officially opens 
Saturday, captures the mantra of Evans. Both a 
clothing store and an art gallery, Gifthorse provides 
a contemporary retreat from corporate homogene -
ity, reflecting the momentum of Gainesville’s young, 
inspired downtown scene.
His business model for Gifthorse is simple: The 
street-level shop is dedicated to a cozy apparel store 
featuring    up-and-coming, affordable fashion, while the 
second floor is an intimate contemporary art gallery.  
“I want to provide people the opportunity to find clothes that aren’t readily available at the mall,” he said, 
“and also encourage them to check out some amaz-
ing artwork that they may not have seen otherwise.”  
Evans’ entrepreneurial career began with a gift store, Berto’s, which explicitly sold his visual art and silk-screened T-shirts. As Berto’s evolved, 
Evans began to include the work of other self-starting artists and designers. The collaborations proved to be a success, leading to the formation 
of The Exchange, located at 815 W. University Ave.  
Since its opening, Evans said The Exchange has challenged the traditional structure typically associ-
ated with retail businesses. Providing exhibition and 
performance space as well as studio art classes for the Gainesville public, The Exchange fuses creativity and commerce.
With the opening of Gifthorse, The Exchange now 
stands solely as an art school and exhibition space, while also providing hip-hop and yoga classes – af-ter all, that’s why Evans created Gifthorse.
“I definitely had enough clothing lines and 
merchandise available to open a strictly ap-parel store,” he said. “But I also wanted to make sure I was providing a space for art in Gifthorse.”  
The clothing lines he selects are “sweatshop-free,” “design-progressive” and gentle on the bank ac-
count, he said.
Prices range from $20 to $65, and Gifthorse 
sells fashions for both women and men, who mostly 
fall within the ages of 20 to 45. Labels sold include 
Toms, Rosa Loves, Lifetime Collective and Good So-
ciety.
The grand opening will feature 
an exhibition of artist Victor Perez.

Hull from Manchester Orchestra and Rick Ross — being from South Florida and liking hip-hop. My beard actually grows in like Emile Hirsch from “Into the Wild” and then kind of gets a Geico-caveman look.”
What is your favorite beard-friendly food?
“There isn’t any really. Everything gets caught 
into it. I’d have to say raw meat. Or actually to fol-
low the manly trend, I’d have to say steak … with a side of steak. That’s just what I feel like people with beards should eat.”
Do you feel more or less attractive with a 
beard?
 “Realistically, I know I’m really shooting myself 
in the foot looking homeless, but I’ve been given a 
gift, and I’m going to use it. If whomever I’m dat-
ing doesn’t appreciate the fact that I have a sweet beard, I don’t want to be with them anyway.” 
Ian Seabrook O’Connor, 20
It’s time for a change: O’Connor, a mechanical 
engineering student, is a first-timer to No-Shave November.
He’d heard about it in the past and decided 
that this year he wanted to try new things and ex-periment with his looks. He says he is anxious to see what his beard will look like because he has never grown one out for more than a week. Dedi-cation is important to him, and he wants to stay committed — he’s not about to break down and break out the razor. 
When he thinks of beards, age and wisdom 
come to mind. However, it’s not a look he plans 
on rocking year-round, and he said he will lose the 
facial hair at the end of the month.
“Not shaving will be a dangerous precedent to 
set,” he said.
What are your expectations?“I expect to really want to shave my face Nov. 
30. I haven’t told my family. I’ve only told my roommates and a few other people, so we’ll see
Who is your celebrity inspiration?
“Zach Galifianakis ... from ‘The Hangover.’”
What is your favorite beard-friendly food? “The best thing to eat would be through a 
straw, like a milkshake or something. I’d never eat a frosted doughnut.”
Do you feel more or less attractive with a 
beard?
“Girls I know will be shocked, and the ones I 
don’t know will just recognize it as a part of me. I 
think it definitely depends on the girl. Maybe this 
way I can attract older women.”12, ALLIGATOR � thursday, november 4, 2010

in blocks with 2.65 per set. The team is 
second in opponent hitting percentage (.164), just behind LSU (.162).
“A team may not be able to side out 
on a first swing attempt — meaning 
pass, set, kill a ball — but if you can block in transition it covers for mis-
takes,” Wise said. “We talk about block-ing sometimes isn’t just a one-point block but it creates another point. If you block a player and then she tries to hit a different shot the next time, that can go to a hitting error.”
Last week the Gators dominated blocking in their matches, out-blocking opponents 18 to three.
Against South Carolina on Oct. 27, 
Florida had nine total blocks while the Gamecocks had only two. Against Ole Miss, the Gators had nine while the Rebels recorded just one.
“Blocking’s really important because 
the defense behind us plays behind the block,” junior middle blocker Cassandra Anderson said. “So if we don’t put up a good block it’s harder for our defense to play. Even if as a middle blocker we don’t go for a block, it’s good for us to jump in the air so they can have a path to read off of.”
Anderson had a match-high six 
blocks against South Carolina and add-ed three more against Ole Miss. She an-chored a defense that limited the confer -
ence foes to hitting percentages of .057 and .067, respectively.
Anderson’s play earned her SEC De-
fensive Player of the Week honors. This is the second time she has been given 
the accolade, as she picked it up in 2008 
as a freshman.
“I think that it’s pretty cool,” Ander -
son said. “I thought we played really well last week and it’s really nice to just be playing well and to be named that.”
Anderson is third in the SEC with 
1.15 blocks per set. However, her 1.21 blocks per set in SEC matches ranks 
first.
Anderson says first-year assistant 
coach Dave Boos has helped the team’s 
defense greatly.
“He has a new scheme that we’ve 
learned since last spring,” Anderson said. “We’ve learned new techniques that I’ve never even learned before.”
Anderson isn’t alone on the block-
ing front. Senior middle blocker Lauren Bledsoe is ninth in the SEC with 1.04 blocks per set.
“We take a lot of pride in our de-
fense because without defense there’s no offense,” Anderson said. “Without defense our whole game will just fall apart.”Black corralled quarterback Aar -
on Murray, who fumbled, and 
Jenkins scooped up the ball at the Georgia 39-yard line.
But bringing so much heat 
left the Gators’ defensive backs vulnerable, Austin said, which is why Murray passed for a career-
high 313 yards. 
Still, Austin said Murray’s 
success against the Florida blitz 
will not affect his play calls for 
the rest of the season. He said 
his pass rushers’ inability to shed blocks on those blitzes is a great-

“You’re not always going to 
get guys (rushing) completely 
clean,” Austin said. “When guys 
do get one-on-ones, they have to win. As far as blitzing, we’re still 
going to bring it. Our guys oper -
ate better when we’re bringing some pressure and making some [tackles for loss].”
Injuries: Guard Carl Johnson 
(calf) is probable for Saturday’s game against Vanderbilt.Running backs Emmanuel 
Moody (thigh) and Mike Gillislee (hamstring) have practiced at full 
speed this week. 
“They are both 100 percent for 
the first time in quite a while,” Meyer said. 
Last Thursday, two days be-
fore the Georgia game, Meyer 
said Gillislee was 100 percent and that Moody was “good.” 
Neither back played against the Bulldogs.
Cornerback Moses Jenkins (el-
bow) will play against Vander -
bilt, Austin said. Wide receiver 
Andre Debose (ankle) has been 
limited in practice, defensive 
tackle Jaye Howard (ankle) has 
not practiced, and kicker Caleb 
Sturgis will not play this week.
Brown still starting: Jeremy 
Brown will start at cornerback this week, Austin said. Brown has 
started seven games this season, 
but he was pulled for freshman Cody Riggs in the second quar -
ter Saturday after surrendering 
a 63-yard touchdown to Tavarres 
King and missing two tackles.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 17

UF defensive tackle Terron Sanders said the Gators’ pass rush is just as good this season as it was last 
year. Florida led the SEC with 40 sacks in 2009 but only ranks eighth with 15 through eight games.

and we didn’t do that.”
One bright spot for the Gators was the 
play of Chandler Parsons, who worked dili-
gently over the offseason to become a more 
complete player. 
The senior showed off the fruits of his 
efforts Wednesday night, recording nine 
points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. 
Parsons also added three steals and a 
block in 27 minutes of action. 
“I’m gonna definitely try to do a little bit 
of everything,” Parsons said. “I’m going to 
try to do whatever I can 
to get my teammates in-volved. I’m going to make them keep me off the of-
fensive glass every night 
out and I’m gonna score the ball.”
For the second game in 
a row, sophomore Kenny Boynton was Flori-
da’s leading scorer, as he netted 22 points on 
9-for-15 shooting. 
Boynton once again hit four three-point-
ers, this time doing so in nine attempts. 
The rest of the team shot a combined 
3-for-13 from distance Wednesday after a 1-for-16 performance in UF’s exhibition opener against Florida Tech.
Junior guard Erving Walker has been the 
poster boy for those struggles, as he has hit just one of his 10 attempts from behind the arc.
“Shots are going to come and go,” Walker 
said. “I just gotta stay confident and take good ones. Whether they go in or not we just gotta live with it, but as long as I’m taking good ones coach is comfortable with that.”Boynton leads

TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL SCOREBOARD UF SOCCERBy GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer

Despite winning by 26 points, the Gators left 
Wednesday’s contest with a decidedly negative 
feeling. 
Although No. 9 Florida took a 25-point lead 
into halftime, it outscored Georgetown (Ky.) 
College just 44-43 in the second half of a 88-62 
victory in the O’Connell Center. 
“There was a huge difference in intensity 
with the way we came out to start the second 
half,” Donovan said. “I really felt like that’s something we are going to have to deal with 
[concerning] our team.”
During the break, Donovan stressed to his 
players that the Tigers would come out hungry 
in the second half and that the Gators would 
need to do the same. 
Evidently the message did not take hold, as 
Georgetown opened the half on a 7-2 run in the 
first 1:02, prompting Donovan to bench all five starters. 
“When we’re up like that we cant take our 
foot off the gas, we gotta keep applying pres-sure, keep getting after it in the press, and we can’t have let-ups like that,” Chandler Parsons 
said. “I think he wanted to send a message that 
if we’re not ready to play, we’re a deep team and we have other guys that can step in and play.”
Florida’s defense took a severe dip across the 
board in the second period. 
After forcing 18 turnovers and holding 
Georgetown to 32 percent shooting in the first 20 minutes, the Gators notched just eight turn-
overs and allowed the Tigers to shoot 53 percent 
in half No. 2. 
“To give up 53 percent shooting in the sec-
ond half from the field and 50 percent from the three-point line is, to me, the reason why I 
don’t think we’re a top-10 team,” Donovan said. 
“Top-10 teams don’t do those things. Great teams and really good teams play 40 minutes, 
Gators win, falter in second half
 UF RANKS EIGHTH AMONG SEC 
SACK LEADERS.

The Florida defense has been much 
more welcoming this year than in the 
past.
Through eight games, the Gators rank 
eighth in the SEC with 15 sacks. Florida led the conference in that category last season, bringing the quarterback down behind the 
line 40 times in 14 games.
“We can do a better job,” defensive co-
ordinator Teryl Austin said. “We’re get-
ting decent pressure, but we’ve got to win 
some one-on-ones. We got to disrupt some 
passes.”
While he doesn’t think the drop off in 
sacks is significant, defensive tackle Ter -
ron Sanders said his group needs to get in 
the backfield more.
“We’re not getting there,” he said. “They’re getting rid of the ball a lot, like 
real quick. There’s a couple things that 
factor into it. I feel like, as an interior de-
fensive linemen, we got to get to the quar -
terback a little bit more. But I feel like, all in all, our pass-
rushing is pretty good.”
To create that pressure, 
Austin was forced to call more blitzes than he wanted 
last week against Georgia. 
Linebacker Jon Bostic and strong safety Ahmad Black recorded both of Florida’s sacks Saturday.
“We ramped (the blitzes) up a little 
bit, and it was kind of feast or famine for us,” Austin said. “Luckily, we had enough 
feast to win.”
One of the most notable “feasts” for 
the Gators was on Black’s sack. The senior 
stunted with freshman linebacker Jelani Jenkins, and no Georgia player picked up 
Black.

The Florida volleyball team 
is trying to prove that state-

The No. 1 Gators (20-1, 
13-0 Southeastern Conference) have won 15 straight matches. Playing arguably the nation’s 
t o u g h e s t s c h e d u l e , they’ve been relying on their defense 
— specifi-cally block-ing.
“Block-
ing at any 
level is huge,” coach Mary Wise said. “If you look at sta-tistics — whether that’s in-ternational volleyball or col-
legiate women’s volleyball 
— and look at the top teams in the nation in blocking, they of-ten have winning records and really good records because blocking can make up for mis-
takes.”

� FLORIDA BEAT STANFORD 
BY 2.5 POINTS LAST YEAR.
By ALLISON BANKO
Alligator Writer
 
If history is any indication, the 
Florida women’s swimming and 
diving team’s matchup with Stan-
ford will be a tight one.
Last year, two meetings with the 
Cardinal produced a pair of nail-biters and one decided the national 
title. The two squads will square 
off again Friday night for a tri-meet with Michigan in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Florida’s regular-season meet 
against Stanford last year boiled down to half a second, with the fi-nal leg of the 200-yard freestyle re-lay serving as the deciding factor.
UF’s quartet of Shara Stafford, 
Gemma Spofforth, Sarah Bateman and Stephanie Napier fell short, 
coming in at 1:33:82, just a hair 
behind Stanford’s time of 1:33:28. However, when the teams next faced each other at the 2010 NCAA 
Championships, the Gators had the 
last laugh, beating out Stanford for the title. 
“The meet ended up being so 
close between so many teams by 
that point, it was anyone’s champi-
onship,” Stafford said. “One person placing one spot lower could have cost any of us that meet.”
The Gators won with a point to-
tal of 382, a mere 2.5 ahead of Stan-ford. They expect another stiff test this weekend.
“It’s a good Stanford team,” 
coach Gregg Troy said. “They grad-uated a few people but had the best 
recruiting class in the country prob-
ably coming in. It’s also a very good Big 10 team in Michigan.”
Last year, the 
Gators beat the Wolverines 292-137.
While the 
women’s team is 
swimming on the other side of the country, the men’s squad will be in the southern comfort of the South-eastern Conference in their meet at 
LSU today. 
One male swimmer is fresh off of twin honors. Senior Conor Dw-
yer won three events in the Georgia 
meet last week, and his times in the 
500- and 1,000-yard freestyles were the fastest in the NCAA this year.
That performance earned him 
Counsilman-Hunsaker National Collegiate Male Swimmer of the Week, and he also snagged the SEC Male Swimmer of the Week hon-ors for the second time this season, 
being the first Gator to do so since 
Ryan Lochte in 2004-05. 
“He’s a class act,” Troy said. 
“The thing that it’s doing is bring-
ing some of the men’s team along 
with it. I feel pretty confident with where the men’s team is, and he is certainly a leader in that aspect.”
In last week’s meet against Georgia, younger swimmers start-ed to step up alongside Dwyer. 
Sophomore Jason Taylor notched a 
second-place finish in the 500 free-style, and sophomore Scott Som-mer contributed to the Gators’ win 
in the 400 freestyle. 
“I think guys like Jason Taylor 
and Scott Sommer can be a huge 
impact for us in the spring,” Dwyer said. “If younger guys can step up 
for us later in the year, we will have 
an excellent team.”
In today’s meet, Dwyer said it 
would be important for younger 
swimmers to step up because some 
won’t be competing due to academ-ic obligations. 
Today’s meet is set for 2 p.m. in 
Baton Rouge, La.
Gators prepare for national championship rematch By ANTHONY CHIANG

The last time Chas Henry attempted a 
field goal to decide the outcome of a game, 
he failed.
The senior missed a game-tying try 
from 42 yards against Mississippi State in 
place of injured kicker Caleb Sturgis to en-
sure a loss for Florida on Oct. 16.
“My confidence was really low,” Henry 
said.
But during Florida’s bye week, he used the extra time off to regain the confidence 
he lost. Even former UF kicker Judd Davis gave Henry a call to make sure he was in the right state of mind.
“Ninety percent of it’s mental and 10 
percent is physical,” Henry said. “It’s kind of like the same thing in golf. It comes down to the person doing their job right. It’s the same thing for holding and the 
same thing for snapping.”
So, when he stepped onto the field 
in overtime with a chance to knock in a 
game-winning 37-yard field goal Saturday, Henry made sure not to flinch. But it wasn’t out of a lack of effort from 
Georgia. The Bulldogs called a timeout in 
an attempt to ice him, and UGA defensive 
coordinator Todd Grantham grabbed his throat and screamed that Henry was going 
to choke.
“I started laughing, 
like, ‘You’re going to ice me? I’m not even the kicker,’” Henry said. “So I start looking and I see 
the guy doing the choke. I look at him again and he does like, ‘You’re gon-
na choke.’ So I take my helmet off and I gave him a little smooch. I blew him a little 
kiss.“That might be why he got a little upset 
about that. Then he did it again.”
None of that bothered Henry, who also 
leads the nation with a 48.8 yards per punt 
average. Not the choke signal or the cru-
cial field goal. 
“I think it’s ridiculous that people are 
trying to say, ‘Oh, he should have to apolo-
gize for (the choke sign) and everything,’” he said. “It’s just an intense game.”
Henry went about his business and 
kicked the ball straight through the up-rights like he knew he would.
“Going into this one there was no doubt 
in my mind that we were making this kick and we were going to win,” Henry said. “This was game over.”Henry regained confidence before Georgia game

UF senior Alexandre Lacroix is one of four Gators who will compete at the 
ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Championships today.  
� FIVE GATORS WILL COMPETE.
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
 
Florida will be well represented in the college 
tennis scene today, as members of both the men’s 
and women’s teams will compete in the USTA/
ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Champion-ships in Flushing, N.Y. 
Hosted by Columbia University, the tour -
nament features some of the best players in the 
country from NCAA Divisions I, II and III as well 
as junior colleges.
Senior Alexandre Lacroix, UF’s lone men’s 
representative in the tournament, has put in an 
intense seven days of preparation for the high-
profile event and has a good chance of winning, coach Andy Jackson said.
“He’s one of those 10 guys who could win it,” 
Jackson said. “But of those 10, any could lose in 
the first round.” 
Lacroix will take on Columbia’s Haig Schnei-
derman, the 2009 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, 
in the first round.
The women’s team will be represented by 
sophomore Allie Will and three freshmen — Alex Cercone, Olivia Janowicz and Sofie Oyen. 
While No. 5 Will continues to show she is one 
of the top players in the country, coach Roland 
Thornqvist is most excited about the develop-
ment of the freshmen. 
“In my 10 years here, this is probably the best 
fall performance and improvement I’ve seen,” he 
said. “We have three freshmen who have done 
very, very well, perhaps outperformed my expec-tations this early.” The tournament will be a good test of how 
good UF really is, Thornqvist said. 
“That’s generally perhaps the toughest event 
that we play all year,” he said. “Every player in that event has qualified by either winning their 
respective regional or by virtue of doing well at 
the All-American or being top 10 in the country.” 
Men travel west: Michael Alford, Andrew 
Butz, Billy Federhofer, Bob van Overbeek and Nassim Slilam will travel to Austin, Texas, to play in the Texas Invitational this weekend. 
Jackson said the tournament will allow players 
to get more match experience against some top-10 competition in Texas, Baylor and Texas A&M. 
Women hosting Fall Classic: Four Gators will 
stay home this weekend as UF hosts the Gator 
Fall Classic. 
Joanna Mather, Claire Bartlett, Brittany Bor -
sanyi and Caroline Hitimana will compete against 
players from Florida State, Florida International and South Florida. 
Although the team has no seniors, Thornqvist 
is pleased with its performance this fall.
“We lost a lot of leadership from last year’s 
team,” he said. “But so far, from a performance 
standpoint, we haven’t really lost anything, per -
haps gotten even better.”UF set for indoor nationals
