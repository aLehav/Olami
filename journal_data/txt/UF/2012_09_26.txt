UF students and volunteers search a creek under the bridge off of Southwest 20th Avenue on Tuesday 
afternoon. The group was looking for Christian Aguilar, 18, who has been missing since Thursday.

It’s been six days since Chris-
tian Aguilar disappeared Thurs-
day night, and the search for the 
missing UF student continued 
Tuesday.
Aguilar, an 18-year-old bio-
medical engineering freshman 
from Miami, was reported miss-
ing Thursday night. 
An arrest was made Monday, 
and a shoe, which did not match the shoes Aguilar wore Thursday, 
was found Tuesday night and col-
lected as evidence, according to a GPD news release. 
Volunteers found the shoe in 
the 1000 block of Northwest 53rd 
Avenue.
Gainesville Police searched 
the Interstate 75 corridor between Newberry Road and Southwest Williston Road on Tuesday, as well as the Southwest 34th Street and Southwest Hull Road areas.
Investigators also checked the 
woods around Southwest 62nd Boulevard, Windmeadows Trailer Park and Alley Katz bowling cen-ter, according to the release.
Out-of-county police agencies donated resources to the search, which included bloodhounds from the Sweetwater Police Department 
and cadaver dogs from the Palm 
Beach County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Police will establish a new com-
mand post by 9 a.m. today at the Alachua County Fairgrounds, 3220 NE 39th Ave., to continue the search.
Police arrested a person of in-
terest, Pedro A. Bravo, 18, and 
charged him Monday with de-priving a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony. 
On Tuesday 
morning, GPD 
released a surveillance photo 
from Thursday afternoon, which 
showed Bravo and Aguilar walk-
ing into the Best Buy on Archer Road. 
Bravo had his ﬁ  rst appearance 
in court Tuesday morning.
As of Tuesday night, he re-
mained in Alachua County Jail 
with $100,000 bond.

As some UF students prepared their 
bodies to go hungry, they also prepared 
their minds for a day of reﬂ  ection.
Yom Kippur is a day of atonement and 
reﬂ  ection during which Jewish people ask 
for forgiveness for any wrongdoings, ac-
cording to Rabbi Gail Swedroe, the new-est campus rabbi at UF Hillel. 
There is also a 25-hour period of fast-
ing.
Hillel hosted a dinner Tuesday night 
as a prelude to fasting. It was followed by Kol Nidre, a prayer service that negates any mistakes made in the past year.
Swedroe said Yom Kippur is the most 
signiﬁ  cant and holiest holiday on the Jew-ish calendar.
She expected about 600 students to 
come to Wednesday services throughout the day. There will be Reform and Con-servative services, she said.
Swedroe said her main focus for this year’s Day of Atonement will be reﬂ  ecting on how to get your priorities in order.
“I think in today’s world it’s very easy 
to go, go, go,” she said. “It can be a day of solidifying what your commitments are.”
Kimmie Kleinman, 20-year-old eco-
nomics junior and an Israel intern at Hil-
lel, wishes more students got involved 
with the High Holidays and with the re-ligion in general.
“I think it is important to celebrate as a 
community,” said Kleinman.
Joshua Kahn, the Jewish Agency Israel 
Fellow to Hillel, said he looks forward to the day of reﬂ  ection as an opportunity to encourage students to reﬂ  ect on their lives 
and futures.
“It’s more than long services and being 
hungry,” he said.Students fast for Yom Kippur� THE GROUP BELIEVES TEBOW 
WOULD MAKE THE PERFECT REPRESENTATION.

Screamin’ Eagle just wanted to get Tim 
Tebow on the phone when he broke into a 
church.
In 2010, Alan Nanney was arrested for 
breaking into the First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, where, according to the Jack-sonville Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, he was found bare-
foot and shirtless.
He was wearing a piece of purple cloth 
as a cape and had hymnals stuffed into his 
pants.
He spent three months in the Duval 
County Jail and six months at the North Florida Evaluation and Treatment Center for the criminally insane in Gainesville.
He started to spread his message only 
eight days after he moved to Gainesville.
On Sept. 13, he distributed 1,000 copies of a booklet titled, “What the Universe Told Me,” on UF students’ doorsteps.
Screamin’ Eagle, 25, born Christopher 
Nanney, distributed the booklet “What the Universe Told Me,” to gain the students’ attentions. He belongs to an organization 
called Children of Light, who wants to re-
cruit UF alumnus Tim Tebow for its cause.
According to its website, Children of 
Light is an institute that 
promotes and educates in-
dividuals about self-mas-
tery and the personal and planetary ascension they believe the world is now 
experiencing.
Nanney said he be-
lieves Tim Tebow would 
be the perfect man to represent Children of 
Light’s cause.
When asked about his interest in Tebow, 
Nanney responded, “I truly believe he pos-sesses the heart and social status to help speak for the Children of Light and to defend 
them against any force — both foreign and Religious group wants Tebow

The National Geographic Society awarded a Flor -
ida Museum of Natural History butterfly and moth 
specialist a $24,000 research grant earlier this month.
Akito Kawahara, an assistant curator at the 
McGuire Center of Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at 
the Florida Museum of Natural History , received the 
one-year grant to do field research in Central America to investigate the tobacco hornworm and relatives.
The tobacco hornworm, or the hummingbird 
moth, is one of about 200,000 moth species, but it may contain more “hidden” species, Kawahara said.
This brown moth grows about as large as a finger 
and gets its unusual name from the prominent horn it has on its backside as a larva, said Kawahara, 34.“It’s a moth you can typically find in your back-
yard,” he said.
The moth is common in Gainesville, but Kawaha-
ra wants to examine different populations. This field research will take Kawahara to Central America.
“I know they’re harmless, but they kinda are scary , 
especially when it’s a big one,” said 21-year-old East Asian languages and literatures junior Mia Jakubi-sin.
Kawahara said his use of the moth in a laboratory 
setting led to his theory of “cryptic” species within 
the tobacco hornworm. As he was studying the DNA 
and behavior of the species, he said, he began to no-tice differences that pointed to possible new subspe-cies of the tobacco hornworm. If he were to find these new subspecies, it could affect how the moth is used in laboratory studies. Scientist gets grant to study wormsSHELBY WEBB

It looked more like a cardboard convention 
than a political forum. Cars were lined with 
posters supporting their candidate of choice, and more signs lined the church lobby.
Candidates for county and state elections 
held an open forum at Westside Baptist Church on Tuesday evening.
Those participating in discussions were 
running for the Alachua County School Board, Sheriff, County Commission, the State House of Representatives and Congress.
The County Commission segment featured 
John Martin from District 1, Robert Hutchinson and Jean Calderwood from District 3, and Dean 
Cheshire, Chuck Chestnut and K. Siva Prasad 
from District 5. Mike Byerly , who is running against Martin in District 1, missed the forum.
Calderwood and Cheshire spent some of 
their time criticizing actions taken by their op-ponents for previous government work.
“His record is not one of making difficult de-
cisions,” Cheshire said of Chestnut. “He’s never voted on a budget during his time in Tallahas-see.”
Andrew Morey and Keith Perry said they 
hope to represent District 21 in the State Legis-lature. While Perry said his main priority was to stimulate the state’s economy and to create jobs, Morey argued that job creation would happen organically if the state strategically invested in 
public education.
“We’ve seen that the legislature has voted to 
cut UF’s budget the past two years,” Morey said. 
“But they opened Florida Polytechnic Universi-ty in Lakeland, which we don’t really need.”
Democrat J.R. Gaillot and Republican Ted 
Yoho, who are both running for U.S. Congress in the third district, have different views on al-most all facets of government.
The two discussed the debt ceiling, tax code 
reforms, stimulating job growth and the Afford-able Healthcare Act, also known as Obamacare.
On almost every issue, the candidates com-
pletely disagreed, especially on Obamacare.
“We need to defund and bury it,” Yoho said 
about the law.
“I fully support it,” Gaillot replied.Contact Shelby Webb at swebb@alligator.org.Church holds political forum

If Jordyn Christian is watching 
TV and sees a negative political 
commercial, she either walks away or mutes it.
The 21-year-old linguistics senior 
is a registered independent and pays attention to both sides during the presidential elections. But the nega-tive ads for the elections are starting to annoy her.
“I’m really sick of mudslinging,” 
she said.
A study done by a UF political 
science professor determined that 
negative ads don’t always work, 
but when they do, it’s on people who trust the government — which Christian said she only does some-times.
A negative ad is one about the 
opponent rather than the candidate who sponsored the ad. Contrast ads, which are considered negative, stress the opponent’s failures and the sponsoring candidate’s success.
The study showed that negative 
ads impact people with high trust and political sophistication.
UF political science professor 
Stephen Craig, who wrote the study, said people with a positive outlook were affected the most.
However, he said the amount of 
people who trust the government is shrinking and has been since the mid-1960s.
Craig said people who are low 
on knowledge and sophistication 
will not be able to process the infor -mation in a negative ad.
He started his research to see 
how candidates respond to negative 
attacks. But first, he needed an effec-tive negative ad.  
Through a controlled experi-
ment with about 
200 political sci-ence students, students looked at two negative ads that attack fictional political incumbents and four responses to each attack.
The negative ads were about tak-
ing advantage, such as inappropri-ately using constituents’ money and being out-of-touch with constitu-ents. Some candidates’ responses to attacks impacted people more than others. 
For example, denial as a response 
worked best. Denial increased an in-cumbent’s vote share by 32.8 percent in taking advantage and 21 percent in out-of-touch. But when denial is 
not available because the evidence 
in the attack is true, counterattack was the next best. After counterat-tack were counterimage and justifi-cation, according to the results.
Craig said people aren’t against 
negative ads, but become weary when candidates go over-the-top.
“It works except when it doesn’t,” 
Craig said.
He said candidates don’t win by 
negative ads. “They need to have a message that resonates with voters,” he said.The results showed some back-
lash against negative ads. During the 
experiment, participants were asked 
to rate the candidates. Ratings for both the candidate who produced the ad and the candidate who was targeted in the ad went down after the attack ad, but the target went down more, Craig said.
Craig also conducted an online 
survey , which is using measures of 
trust and knowledge, to have a larg-
er sample size. The data has not yet been analyzed.
Sean Williams, a 22-year-old 
linguistics senior, said negative ads don’t sway votes — at least not his.
“But regardless, it plants a doubt 
in their mind,” he said.

Study finds students become skeptical of negative political ads
Baker channels an archangel
domestic — that is not in line with 
the measures that must be taken for the human race to survive.”
The group hopes to reveal a path 
of personal healing to awaken the consciousness of souls.
Students, however, are a bit skep-
tical of the matter.
Paul Cirino, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication junior, said the group wants Tebow as its spokes-man only because of his status.
“The other possibility is they 
actually believe that Tim Tebow is called to their group like they are,” he said.Children of Light began in 1990, 
when founder Ron Baker met Robert 
Baker.
Robert Baker is trance channel for 
the Archangel Gabriel, according the to group’s website.
The site states Gabriel commu-
nicates through Robert Baker on 
a weekly basis, through whom he gives informative lectures and does 
a Q&A segment.
“When my message gets to him, 
he will find himself at a crossroads 
that will test his faith in an Earth-shaking way. He may find every 
belief he’s ever held and everyone 
he’s ever loved standing on one side of the road and just me on the other. But I speak for the Father. My 
word is the eternal flame. It shall be 
on Earth as it is in Heaven,” Nanney later said about Tebow.
Tebow and his management 
agency, William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, could not be reached for comment.tEbo W, from page 1� STUDENTS REGISTERED AND

Fifty-nine people showed up to 
register to vote and update their voter 
information Tuesday at Pugh Hall Oc-
ora.
The event was in honor of National 
Voter Registration Day and was spon-
sored by the Bob Graham Center for 
Public Service.
Journalism senior Kelly MacLellan, 
who is the internal vice president for 
Gator Coalition for Civic Engagement, said she was pleased with the turnout 
at the event.
“In and out and passer-bys is kind of 
what I expected,” she said. 
“I don’t necessarily expect everyone 
to be coming out, because an advantage 
of our system is that they can do it any-where.”
Students registered and updated 
their voter information with an iPad and Samsung Galaxy Tab.
After registering, they could enjoy 
drinks and snacks.
MacLellan, 21, said TurboVote saves 
time when people register online.
“It’s like Netflix for voting,” she 
said. 
“I think voting is important, because 
government is important and has a huge role in our lives between schools to roads to taxes. 
It is very important for students to 
be aware of who’s in office and who’s making those decisions.”
Annastasia Mula, an agricultural 
education and communications junior, 
changed her address using the new 
TurboVote system.
“I don’t like stupid tablets, but other 
than that it was very easy,” the 21-year-
old said.

About 10 people sat in the back of Reitz 
Union Room 282 Tuesday night holding 
signs with messages like “Reitz wouldn’t 
want me here” and “Reitz was a bigot. 
Stop defending him.”
They attended the Student Senate meet-
ing in support of a referendum that asks 
students if they want to rename the Reitz 
Union after Virgil Hawkins, an African-American man who was denied entrance to UF in 1949. Last week, the UF Supreme Court passed an amended version of the referendum, which will appear on the Oc-
tober Student Government ballot.
Dave Schneider, a former UF student, 
visited from Tallahassee to support the 
referendum. He came with the Dream De-
fenders, an organization inspired by the 
values of Martin Luther King Jr.
Schneider said the referendum ques-
tion means more than a new student union 
name. He said the issue is about students 
living in post-racial America.
“This country is only great because 
we have people constantly challenging to make it better,” Schneider said.
Ford Dwyer, the author of the referen-
dum, told the Senate about Dan Harmel-
ing, a 70-year-old man who attended UF 
during J. Wayne Reitz’ presidency. 
Ford said Harmeling and his twin 
brother Jim Harmeling were both targeted 
by Reitz for their civil rights activism in 
the 60s, leading to Jim Harmeling’s even-
tual suicide.
Student Body President Tj Villamil also 
discussed the Reitz Union expansion at 
the meeting. He said students can give in-put regarding the new design from noon to 1:30 p.m. Monday and Tuesday on the 
first floor of the Reitz Union.
“I’m really excited to know we are 
going to be at the forefront of student 
unions,” Villamil said.

A business can be born within 
54 hours.
Startup Weekend, a three-day 
entrepreneurial conference, is 
coming to Gainesville Friday to 
bring professionals together to de-
velop startup businesses.
The event starts at 6 p.m. down-
town at the Gainesville Hacker -
space, 101 SE Second Place, where management consultant John Spence will speak, said JR Miller, an event volunteer.
Participants will pitch ideas in 60 seconds, and voters will choose the top 10 ideas. Those ideas will then grow over the course of the weekend.
Participants will break into 
teams and dedicate Saturday and most of Sunday to conducting market research and developing the ideas.
On Sunday night, the teams will 
present their product to a panel of judges made up of founders and CEOs from across the country, in-
cluding former UF student Sam 
Tarantino, co-founder and CEO of Grooveshark, Miller said.
The top three teams will win up to $10,000 in consulting resources, gift cards, giveaways from spon-sors and tablets to help their busi-nesses, said co-director Anjali 
Kundra.
Kundra, 26, graduated from 
UF’s Masters of Entrepreneurship 
program and is vice president of client services at RoomSync, a Gainesville-based startup com-pany. She said she encourages stu-dents, residents and entrepreneurs alike to attend the event.
“It’s not just meant for people 
that are in startups already,” she said. “Anyone with drive can do it.”Student registration is $20, and 
general registration is $50, Kundra said. Participants who register as developers or designers can get a 
25 percent discount using the code 
HACKERS. Those who don’t want to participate can observe the event on the non-attendee track.
“Our whole goal with this is to 
highlight the best and brightest of Gainesville,” she said.
The bulk of the event will be in 
Hackerspace downtown, where 
the owners will provide resources 
and space to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, she said.
Kundra’s brother, Nikhil Kun-dra, 22, will participate in the 
event. The siblings graduated 
from the same program.
Nikhil Kundra is a veteran 
of weekend startup events. He founded Partender, an app that speeds up the bar inventory re-cording process, at 3 Day Startup Gainesville, which is an event sim-ilar to Startup Weekend.
He hopes other participants

With Internet cafes causing 
controversy across the state, a 
Gainesville resident has voiced her concern about the stores to the city commission.
Kathryn Hillgardner, 43, said 
she considers Internet cafes a growing problem. Hillgardner, a self-professed former gam-bling addict, said she lost more than $100,000 at Internet cafes throughout the years and hopes to make other people aware of the potential issues that come 
with the cafes. She said she hopes 
to let the community know there is help available if they struggle with the same problems.
“Money does not mean what 
it did to me,” she said. “If I can reach people and help them over -
come what I did, it would be great.”
Internet cafes are locally 
owned computer hubs where pa-trons pay for Internet time and are given free “sweepstakes” games that some equate to gambling.
Hillgardner met with Com-
missioner Randy Wells earlier this week to talk about her con-cerns. Wells said he admired her for her determination.
However, he said he didn’t 
know if there was much the city could do legally.
“I appreciate the fact that she 
has opened up about herself and 
her experiences,” he said.
Hillgardner said she questions 
whether the businesses should be 
considered legitimate businesses.
“They’re really offering the 
opportunity to gamble,” she said.

in Gainesville and Ocala declined to comment.Internet cafes cause stir � EIGHT PEOPLE ARE

The Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History received a three-year 
$339,000 grant from the National Science Foundation for research-ers to expand their digitized col-
lection of invertebrate specimens.
Digitizing a collection involves 
capturing data associated with the 
specimens on an electronic plat-form to make it available on the Internet, said Gustav Paulay, the museum’s malacology curator. 
The digitization aligns with 
the National Science Foundation’s push to digitize all U.S. biological collections, according to a news release.
“The data includes the iden-
tification of the specimens, loca-tion and habitat of the collection, the collector, notes about biology, symbiosis, et cetera,” Paulay said. “They may also include DNA se-quences and photos.”
He said the collection already 
contains 500,000 lots, or species from one specific location. With the money from the grant, 100,000 more lots will be digitized. On average, each lot has seven speci-mens.
Ninety percent of the grant will 
go toward the salary of student OPS, or Other Personnel Services, 
performing the work, and 10 per -
cent will go toward supplies for 
housing specimens, Paulay said.
Students, staff and researchers 
can benefit from the availability and access of the digitized collec-tion’s summarized information, said Ashley Berkow, collections assistant at the museum and geol-ogy junior.
The collection allows research-
ers the ability to look up any spec-imen without having to travel to the museum or request it be shipped.
“If everyone’s collection could 
be more accessible for everyone else to reach, I think it’d make everything much easier,” said Berkow, 20.
She said there are eight people 
working on the digitization proj-ect, and most of them are stu-dents.
The workers clean specimens, 
catalog their information and photograph them, Berkow said.
The Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History trails in second behind 
the Smithsonian Institution for 
having the largest digitized col-lection of invertebrates.
Paulay, 55, said the museum 
has been a leader with this collec-tion, because other institutions are slow to digitize their holdings.
He said his love of nature and 
his interest in diversity led him to finding his passion in the field 
and in expanding the digitized 
collection.
“Think of it as a library of 
life,” Paulay said. “It makes the enormous amount of information encompassed in our collection broadly available to anyone.”
UF Florida Museum goes digital“This country is only great be-
cause we have people constantly 
challenging to make it better.”

Why cars and com-
puters shouldn’t mix
We’ve heard about a few problems with the new iOS6 
from Apple after it was released last week.
One of the biggest complaints was that the new 
Apple Maps program looked like it was “imagined by Dali,” ac-cording to a BuzzFeed article.
Yeah, don’t follow those maps exactly , because they will fool 
you into thinking roads travel upward. The app mislabels loca-tions quite frequently.
The point is, don’t use the app until Apple ﬁ  xes it. They might 
ﬁ  x it soon, as TechCrunch reports that Apple is in talks with the engineers of Google Maps.
The geniuses at Google recently turned into mad scientists; 
they invented a car that can drive itself.
What’s worse is that California Gov. Jerry Brown  signed a 
bill this week that would allow self-driving cars on California roads.
According to a Forbes article, California is most likely the 
state with the worst drivers. The article analyzed a report from Allstate, the “America’s Best Drivers Report,” which took data from the country’s 200 biggest cities.
Technically, Washington, D.C. has the worst drivers, averag-
ing a collision once every 4.7 years, but ﬁ  ve cities in California were in the worst 25. Watch out in Glendale, San Francisco, Los 
Angeles, Fullerton and Torrence. New Jersey had four cities in 
the worst 25, and Florida and Virginia each had three cities, ac-cording to the Forbes article.
So why would Brown allow less physical control over cars 
in his state?
“These vehicles have the potential to avoid accidents … We 
can save lives, create jobs and reduce congestion,” said Google co-founder Sergey Brin, according to the Los Angeles Times. “I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than human-driven 
cars.”
Do these dudes want to make these cars legal so that they can 
have fun not-driving, or do they only want to make semi-witty 
puns about it?
“We are stepping on the accelerator when it comes to the 
Google car,” said Sen. Alex Padilla; he sponsors the bill. 
Not only would each autonomous car need to be approved 
for the road, but drivers would need a separate permit to sit be-hind the wheel of a driverless car — and in case the computer 
crashes, be ready to take control.
But drivers in that state can barely control cars without com-
puters. We understand technology is allowed to make progress 
and, in theory , this idea is cool and très “The Jetsons,” but doesn’t this seem like a crazy idea that can only go horribly wrong? 
Are robot cars the latest harbingers of destruction?“Last year, similar legislation was signed into law in Ne-
vada,” wrote the Los Angeles Times. “In addition, Arizona, Hawaii, Florida and Oklahoma are considering autonomous-
vehicle legislation.”
Buckle up, folks, because it’s going to be a bumpy ride. Into 
an ocean, probably. Or, like, the car next to you.
Let’s just hope these cars use Google Maps.There is a war going on inside me, and I’m not talk-
ing about that fourth meal stuff that Taco Bell is ped-dling these days.
I’m referencing an ideological battle that I was hesi-
tantly drafted into when I learned to think. On one hand, my life has been transformed by passionately pursuing the God of the Bible.  On the other, I have always been capti-vated by the sciences.
You could say I’m something like an ideological mutt.As a child, I was often heralded as the avatar of Steve 
Urkel. I asked for microscopes and telescopes for birth-days, and my friends called me “Microbe Man.” 
I was a consummate science nerd, which led me to 
study engineering at UF for years before the daring shift to religion.
As an empirically-minded thinker, religion has been a 
difﬁ  cult sell for me. I empathize with a friend who con-ﬁ  ded he felt wholly dissatisﬁ  ed with the pervasiveness of the “don’t think, just believe” nature of modern religious 
institutions — especially Christianity.
It’s true that the Bible afﬁ  rms the impossibility of pleas-
ing God without faith, but many Christians, unfortunately, 
resign themselves to a frustrating brand of belief that would rather argue about the deﬁ  nition of the word “theory” than seek to understand a prevalent concept in academia.  
Faith, by nature, doesn’t require evidence, but it also 
doesn’t stick its head in the sand.
Still, as my scientiﬁ  c knowledge increased through the 
years, I hit a crossroad. How could faith stand unshaken 
in the face of an evolutionary theory that asserts that the 
biodiversity we see is the result of an innumerable quantity of unguided successive changes?
What do all of these facts, charts and fossils mean for a 
guy like me?
Not much, I’ll admit with hesitancy.  I recognize that I’m biased (like every human), but look-
ing at the facts was not the deﬁ  nitive story I’d been told my 
entire life.  As well conceptualized as evolution is, science depends on evidence.  Clearly, 
adaptation (or microevolution) happens in the world around us.  
People adapt. Species adapt.
I’m not insane enough to deny 
that. 
But saying that beak length 
will vary throughout 100 years in 
an isolated bird population and 
assuming that those changes will add up to an entirely dif-ferent species given time (macroevolution) are two differ-ent things.  
I might be committing some serious shenanigans here, 
but where are the fossils of all the successive changes?  No, really.  Where are they?
I’m not talking about a cute horse diagram that was 
drawn up from someone’s imagination, or a museum Ne-anderthal that was “scaled up” from a solitary jawbone.  I want to see the proof of evolution, the in-betweens.  
Darwin said that the most formidable opposition to his 
theory would come in the form of a fossil record that didn’t back up the successive change model. It was taken in good faith that the fossil record was not complete then. After a century and a half of fossil excavations, are we still evoking the same reasoning?
Go ahead and Google the Cambrian Explosion.  How does an evolutionary process that necessitates eons 
suddenly develop the ability to take quantum leaps in the form of punctuated equilibrium?  If that doesn’t qualify as 
the most ironic deus ex machina, I don’t know what does.
It’s intriguing to hear people assert that science is about 
proof, and that faith is for the weak-minded. Perhaps they 
missed the memo.
I might be a man of faith, but I surmise that many more 
unwittingly belong in that category.

We are one week away 
from seeing a  side-
by-side contrast of 
both major presidential candi-
dates.  The ﬁ  rst of a series of de-
bates between President Barack 
Obama and Gov . Mitt Romney is rapidly approaching.
On Oct. 3, both candidates 
will square off at the University of Denver to discuss domestic issues with emphasis on 
the economy, unemployment and the federal deﬁ  cit.
Televised debates have been an essential focus in the 
modern political campaign since 1960, when President Kennedy outshined and overwhelmed Richard Nixon in 
front of a national audience. At that time, with a growing national media, the American public had limited access to 
presidential candidates. The emergence of TV during that 
era allowed ordinary Americans to better identify and become acquainted with the candidates. It appears likely 
that in 1960, with a nervous Nixon in view to the public, 
he lost ground to the future victor.
Both candidates demonstrated an initial impression to 
many voters, and national exposure gave a way to see the contrast between them. The debates seemed to be the pri-mary way to consider both candidates side by side.
After the ﬁ  rst 1960 debate, Gallup polls show that Ken-
nedy moved from one point behind Nixon to three points ahead. In that era, with a lack of side-by-side contrast, de-
bates were key in shifting public opinion.  
However, as the American people may have been 
largely unfamiliar with the candidates then, they may be too familiar with the candidates now. The emergence of 
multiple news networks on TV , the Internet and Facebook and Twitter have developed an overexposure of Obama 
and Romney.
Neither candidate can say one word or make a single 
appearance without being criticized, overevaluated and picked apart. With every event available on video to a 
national audience for nearly two years prior to Election Day, the majority of voters have inevitably decided on a 
candidate weeks, and even months, prior to the series of 
debates.  
Gaffes are magniﬁ  ed.  Every word and every sentence 
uttered is examined from multiple perspectives in mul-tiple mediums.  
As such, the positive, and especially the negative, as-
pects of our political leaders are condemned on a wide array of settings.
This level of overexposure to our political leaders 
seems to bring an unprecedented degree of criticism that divides the American public and widens our polarization on the issues. It appears to have reached the point that, 
regardless of the victor of an election, the majority of the 
voting public would remain unhappy.
Now during the 2012 election cycle, we already have 
that side-by-side comparison of the candidates. We have had this information for months.  
Candidates are essentially going through the process 
and attempting to appeal to the few undecided voters. As a result, the debates — as important as they once were in deﬁ  ning a candidate’s vision and in creating contrast 
— are now effectively telling us what we already know. 
Now, their overall impact should be minimal, since the media has essentially deﬁ  ned the candidates for us.
Instead, the debates should be a way to differentiate 
candidates and their respective visions and leadership styles as they were in the days of Kennedy and Nixon. 
It appears that, like all other campaign events, this year’s 
debates will primarily serve as material for the opposition to use as ammunition.
The debates will serve to widen candidates’ view-
points on the issues. Unfortunately, I expect they will have little impact in deﬁ  ning the remainder of the presidential 
campaign.

opinions@alligator.orgI agree with David Bradshaw that the recently enact-
ed Student Government campaign rules needlessly obstruct free speech. I write to encourage fellow 
students and the administration to oppose these unrea-sonable time constraints on a candidate’s ability to cam-paign for SG elections. The troubling restriction prohib-its “any intentional action in support of … a candidate or 
party for an elective student body ofﬁ  ce and posting of 
election speciﬁ  c materials…” more than one week before the election.
Election-speciﬁ  c materials include speeches or web-
sites soliciting support (“vote for me”) for a candidate or 
political party. The restrictions on website material are 
especially troubling given that the Internet has the char-acteristics of a traditional public forum where debate is accepted and expected.
Such a severe restriction limits the ability of students 
to introduce  themselves as candidates in the election cycle to a very large and diverse Student Body — almost 50,000 students this fall. Although this restriction ap-pears to be viewpoint-neutral, the actual effect may be 
to make it especially difﬁ  cult for members of opposing 
parties to successfully elect their candidates.
Why have any restrictions on SG election campaigns? 
One author of the bill made the questionable claim that 
restricting campaigning to less than one week before 
elections will promote bipartisanship, because they will spend more time on their Senate duties.
Given the educational mission of UF as a whole, rea-
sonable restrictions, such as a minimum GPA require-
ment, serve to protect the educational experience of SG 
and will be supported by law. Courts rightly grant great deference to university judgment on academic matters, but this does not mean universities always practice cor-
rect or consistent judgment.
Unfortunately for the defenders of restricting student 
speech, the new time restrictions on campaigning do 
not advance the educational interests of students at UF. These restrictions detract from the educational purpose 
of SG participation and are glaringly inconsistent with 
UF’s policies and practices regarding other activities.
UF recognizes the ability and educational value of 
letting students learn to manage time and distractions 
in other settings. We expect our student athletes to al-
most continually train and compete at the national level. Coach Will Muschamp would blanch at the idea that players could only begin condi-tioning and practicing for a spe-ciﬁ  c position one week before the ﬁ  rst game.
We also have a healthy Greek 
system, and the university maintains a website that lists the beneﬁ  ts to joining sororities and fraternities while acknowledging that the ﬁ  rst semester “is the most time intensive because the new member goes through the 
chapter’s new member education/membership intake 
program.” The pleasant process, otherwise known as pledging, most assuredly lasts longer than one week and is time-consuming.
Those who defend student speech restrictions may 
also argue that allowing students to give speeches and distribute literature in support of particular candidates sooner than one week before elections will generate an excessive amount of electioneering communications.
This argument fails to acknowledge that UF students 
have always been expected to remain committed to their coursework amid a litany of campus speakers (including one very distracting Ron Jeremy), itinerant preachers, athletic events and conferences. Indeed, learning to man-
age schedules and the distractions of life are important 
aspects of higher education and becoming an adult.  
It’s hard to imagine how allowing students to cam-
paign for ofﬁ  ce more than seven days prior to an elec-
tion will unduly disrupt the educational mission of UF.  
Restricting election-speciﬁ  c campaign activities to less than one week before elections may actually make mat-ters worse — candidates and parties feverishly accost Turlington travelers and pass out election-speciﬁ  c ma-
terials during their allotted free speech time, knowing 
they only have one week to do so.
The UF Interfraternity Council writes on its website 
that “the more energy and time a member dedicates to 
his fraternity, the more that member gains from the ex-
perience.” 
I agree.The university administration and student govern-
ment should extend this logic to the educational experi-
ences of a candidate who wishes to campaign more than 
seven days before the election.
Excessive campaign restrictions diminish the number 
and quality of ideas generated by the Student Body — 
the most important educational mission of our univer-
sity.

UF’s voice will soon resound in Colombia as the first North 
American choir to be invited to an international choral festi-
val.
Chamber singers in the Concert Choir will headline the 
17th annual Encuentro Coral de Musica Colombiana in Buga, 
Colombia, from Oct. 16 to Oct. 21. The noncompetitive inter -
national choral festival will feature about 25 choirs from six 
countries — and UF’s is the first North American choir to be invited.
It’s considered the most important choral event in the coun-
try, according to an email from Carlos Armando Perez, presi-dent of Corporación Para el Desarrollo Coral de Buga (or Cor -
pacoros), the Colombian nonprofit sponsoring the event.
In 2011, Perez asked Will Kesling, the UF School of Music’s 
director of choral activity and conductor of UF’s Concert Choir, to bring a chamber of up to 25 students from the choir to the festival.
“For the man to come from Buga, Colombia, to meet with 
me and invite us,” Kesling said, “he must think our choir is good.”
Students from UF’s concert choir, a group of about 75 rang-
ing from freshmen to doctoral students, auditioned in Spring 2012 to go to Colombia, Kesling said.
The selected students, about eight of whom are not music 
majors, will be accompanied by four staff and faculty members on the trip.
The chamber singers will perform at a concert almost every 
night in Buga and surrounding cities during the six-day trip, he said. The singers will also serve as the demonstration choir in master classes that Kesling will teach to all of the choirs, teach-ers and conductors attending the festival.
Attendees will unite for the final concert Oct. 20 to perform 
these spirituals together.
“I love making music with people all over the world,” Kes-
ling said. “I love the fact that I can speak with them even if I don’t speak their language, because we’re speaking music, 
which is the world’s common language.”
To prepare for the event, the singers are attending regular 
rehearsals during classes Tuesdays and Thursdays with the 
Concert Choir, he said. They also attended a weekend-long re-treat Sept. 14 through Sept. 16 to learn and practice the spiritu-als they will perform at the festival.
The Sunday before leaving for the trip, the singers will have 
a “pull-in rehearsal” to get the sound together as a smaller group on songs they rehearsed with the Concert Choir.
This will be the first international choir trip for Joyner Atiles-
Lopez, a 20-year-old recreation, parks and tourism junior spe-cializing in event management and a bass II singer.
“At first, my mom thought I was lying,” Atiles-Lopez said. 
“But now she’s fully behind me.”
Camille Lively, a 33-year-old first-year master of music in 
choral conducting student and one of Kesling’s graduate as-sistants, said international events are like doing a musicology research project.
“You can’t open yourself up to an experience like this with-
out growing in some way or learning something in some way ,” she said.UF choir first North American group to attend  international festival

Stacy Tasman sat in her 
UF public relations class and 
pitched idea after idea about fake companies. Little did she know, she’d be doing the same 
thing years later when the mon-
ey was real.
Despite the daunting nature 
of starting a business, two UF alumnae have taken the plunge to create their own startups. One launched her business this month, and another is celebrat-ing one year running a success-
ful website.
Joana Florez, a UF alumna, 
left her contract attorney job 
to start ShopRagHouse.com, a fashion platform that allows de-signers to submit fashion ideas for review and sale.
Since Florez’s site launched 
two weeks ago, it has drawn in 
100 members, including several 
fashion lovers, friends and fam-ily.
Tasman, who graduated 
with a degree in public rela-tions, started HowHeAsked.com, a website that posts en-gagement stories and photos. Since the site’s launch last year, Tasman has received hundreds of proposal stories from couples 
nationwide, she said. 
Despite the economy , online 
businesses have a big advantage 
over storefront small businesses, said Mark Rush, UF economics professor.
“When an online company 
hits it big, it can hit it huge,” he said. “Local businesses aren’t 
the ones to make millions of 
dollars in three or four years. Online businesses experience that.”
Although the two women 
are far from drawing in mil-lions, they said their online plat-form has put them on the road to success.
Florez said she attributes 
much of her success to the en-thusiasm of The Gator Nation.
“A lot of my friends at UF 
had a very entrepreneurial spir -
it,” said Florez, 27, who gradu-ated with a criminology degree before heading to law school at Harvard.
Some of her friends helped 
inspire the business’ launch and gave advice on networking.
Tasman said she felt inspired 
by her public relations classes that helped her develop, pitch and promote ideas.
“Creating storylines off of 
fake and real businesses in my classes inspired me,” said Tas-
man, 24. “Those skills gave me the backbone to pitch my blog 
idea.”
Florez’s website has had two 
designs submitted so far, but Florez and her business partner are looking for 10 more design 
pitches before they open voting 
for members to pick a winner.
While building her website, 
Tasman kept in touch her for -
mer UF instructor Adam Born-stein to ask for advice about promoting and networking.
Bornstein, 30, now the edito-
rial director of Livestrong.com, 
said networking and social en-
gine optimization are key to on-line startups.
“Stacy took a smart idea that 
appeals to everyone and carved out a special niche, where there wasn’t much competition,” Bornstein said. “She wasn’t afraid to ask for help, and she 
combined her feel-good story-
telling elements with other busi-ness connections, aside from my advice.”
Tasman said starting her 
website has promoted her pas-sion for storytelling and given her a meaningful career path.
“Many people go the route 
of having the typical 9-to-5 job, which can get mundane,” Tas-man said. “Start finding what it is that will get you up in the morning, and run with it. You never know — that very idea could turn into the next great career.”

A UF research team will work with about 
200 parents and children during a childhood 
obesity awareness and intervention workshop Thursday.
Sponsored by UF’s Health Disparities Re-search and Intervention Program, the work-
shop is intended for families in the Head Start/
Volunteer Pre-Kindergarten program within Alachua County Public Schools, said Tya M. Arthur, a postdoctoral research associate.
The workshop is a shortened version of 
the Health-Smart Behavior Program created by Carolyn M. Tucker, director of UF’s Health Disparities Research and Intervention Pro-gram.
Because September is National Childhood 
Obesity Month, the program hopes to raise awareness for the severity of the problem and to decrease the “obesity disparity” among communities, including the ethnic-minority, socio-economically disadvantaged and medi-cally underserved, Arthur said.
Thursday’s event will include physical ac-
tivities for the kids and joint goal-setting be-tween the parent and child. Facilitators will 
show part of the Family Health Self-Empow-erment DVD. During that time, parents can 
explain barriers and offer real-life solutions.
“People are the experts,” Arthur said.About 50 undergraduate and six graduate 
students are a part of the research team facili-tating the discussions and activities.
Tasia Smith, a graduate student in counsel-
ing psychology and a graduate director for the 
program, will be one of the individuals assist-
ing with the workshop.
“Children can’t do it alone,” Smith said.

Another drinking and dining option has 
arrived in Downtown Gainesville.
The Jones B-side, a restaurant with a fo-
cus on locally grown and vegan fare, ofﬁ  -
cially opened Tuesday afternoon at 203 SW Second Ave.
The restaurant is an expansion of The 
Jones Eastside, at 401 NE 23rd Ave. The new eatery has inside and patio seating 
and a full bar. 
While The Jones Eastside focuses on 
breakfast and lunch, The Jones B-side in-
cludes dinner and drink options.
The Jones B-side is open from 11 a.m to 
2 a.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. Saturday and Sunday. The restau-
rant also has its own parking lot.
The Jones Eastside has 30 seats, so the 
restaurant opened a new location to sat-
isfy customer demand, said Stefani Weed, front-of-house manager for The Jones B-
side.
Weed said she hopes the new location 
will draw in students since the restaurant 
is close to college apartments.
“We wanted to expand because the cus-
tomers wanted it,” Weed said. “It needed to happen because [of] the want and need of local food and supporting the commu-nity.”
The menu includes vegan, vegetarian 
and gluten-free options. The new restau-
rant kept a few of the most popular items for brunch, lunch and dinner. 
A new item on the menu is the poutine, 
which is a dish of fries, chicken or vegetar-ian gravy and cheese curds.The prices for lunch range from about 
$7 to $12, and dinner prices are roughly $8 
to $22, not including specials.
Offerings at Jones B-side include Jones 
Rancheros for $8.95, which are eggs served on toasted corn tortillas with organic black beans and salsa fresca, and Mojo Pork Chi-
michanga for $10.25, which is shredded 
pork in a ﬂ  our tortilla and served with beans and rice.
Prices for beer range from $3 to $6.Weed said the restaurant emphasizes lo-
cal ingredients on its menu, including on its drink menu. 
Liquors are from family-owned distill-
eries, and most of the vodka and beer is 
from Florida.
Weed said the main goal of The Jones B-
side is to serve healthy, local and sustain-
able food, and it plans to eventually plant its own garden on the property.
Kelsie Stewart, a 25-year-old religion 
graduate student, attended the opening. She eats at The Jones Eastside a few times a month and said she enjoyed the new res-
taurant.
She said the fresh food, local ingredients 
and variety of options is what keeps her 
coming back to both restaurants.
“I go out of my way to go to the other 
Jones,” she said. “It’s a little bit different from what I’ve been eating for a long time.WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park wants 
volunteers to become “Ardisia assassins” 
Saturday.
The park is gathering volunteers to re-
move Ardisia, an invasive plant, from 9 a.m. to noon as part of National Public Lands Day.
Park Service Specialist Amber Roux said 
the event is free and open to the public. She said volunteers will remove the invasive and exotic Coral Ardisia, which is common in shady areas of the park.
“It needs to be removed by hand, so it 
takes a lot of people,” Roux said. “It will help restore natural ecosystems to the nor-mal balance.”
There are about 25 volunteers registered 
to participate, but the sign-up is still open, she said.Ken Langeland, a UF professor who spe-
cializes in the management of upland inva-sive vegetation, said the Coral Ardisia has a negative impact on native plants.
“It is reproducing on its own where it is 
replacing natural vegetation,” Langeland said. “It displaces native plant communities and disrupts native habitats.”
He said aside from the work volunteers 
will do, he hopes people will learn about the harm invasive plants cause to the natu-ral environment.
“I really applaud people who are put-
ting their efforts and energy into organiz-
ing these events and the volunteers who 
participate in them,” he said.Paynes Prairie to remove plants � THE EVENT WILL SUPPORT 
MARCH OF DIMES.

Gators March for Babies will host its 
ﬁ  rst charity golf tournament Saturday at 
the Meadowbrook Golf Club.
The fundraiser supports March of 
Dimes, an effort to help all babies have a 
healthy and full-term birth, according to 
a news release. Saturday’s four-person scramble will take place from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the golf course, at 3200 NW 98th St.
“We’re targeting it not necessarily to-
ward college students, but the UF com-munity,” said special events director and 21-year-old English senior Brittany 
Fining.
Registration is $60 for college stu-
dents and $90 for UF staff and faculty 
members and includes green fees, a golf cart and lunch from Chef Brothers Cus-tom Catering, according to the release.
If golfers sign up with a four-person 
team, registration is $80 per golfer. Golf-ers’ money will be refunded if the tour-nament is canceled because of rain.
Up to 80 people may register for the 
event, but Gators March for Babies ex-pects about 50 people to register, Fining said.
She said she expects Saturday’s event 
to raise about $4,000.
In the past nine years, Gators March 
for Babies has raised more than $350,000 for the March of Dimes. This year’s walk is scheduled for Nov. 4, according to the release.
Prizes from Gator Skeet and Trap 
Club, McAlister’s Deli and Chili’s will be rafﬂ  ed and awarded for the closest to the pin and the longest drive.
Registration for the event closes 
today. People interested in participat-ing can sign up at www.golfforbabies.eventbrite.com.Charity hosts golf fundraiser

Poll Question
Is Florida’s bye week coming at a good time? Vote online at 
alligatorSports.org. Senior midﬁ  elder Jo Dragotta 
has brought a steady and composed presence to the Florida soccer team this season. See story, page 15. 
  GREG LUCA

  Will Muschamp believes the Gators 
are a better team than they were a 
year ago because of improvements on 
the line of scrimmage, but he still sees 
plenty of room for progress on the pe-rimeter. 
  While a strong run game has been 
a major factor in UF’s 4-0 start, Mus-champ is looking for better blocking on the outside. On defense, Muschamp 
wants players to develop a better grasp 
of their responsibilities.
  “A little bit of our issues came as far 
as the perimeter run for us, something we’re going to really work on here 
in the open date,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ve got to do a better job of block-ing on the perimeter. That’s where you get big runs.”
  Although Florida has averaged 
224.5 yards per game on the ground, many of those have come on runs be-tween the tackles by Mike Gillislee. 
  Muschamp wanted to develop more 
of a downhill running game this sea-son after Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps led a perimeter-based rushing attack last year before moving on to the NFL. Although Muschamp said he appreci-ates Gillislee’s one-cut approach, the 
Gators have used speedster Solomon 
Patton to establish a perimeter rush-
ing attack with jet sweeps. Pat-ton has carried 
seven times for 
71 yards this season. 
  “You’ve got to be multiple in 
what you’re doing,” Muschamp said. “Against some of the defenses we’re 
going to face, starting with LSU, you’re not going to be able to line up in stag-nant positions and consistently run the 
ball. Their fronts are too good.”
  Muschamp expressed concern 
about defending runs on the perim-
eter. Florida’s rush defense ranks sixth in the Southeastern Conference with 
119.3 yards allowed per game.
  Muschamp said the primary issue 
has been a misunderstanding regard-
ing who is responsible for setting the 
edge. On every play, Florida has both a Florida looking to shore up 
perimeter during off week    JOSH JURNOVOY

 The season is young, but the Gators 
could already use a break.
  Luckily for them, they have an unusu-
ally early bye week.
  “It’s a good thing for us,” linebacker 
Mike Taylor said. “Perfect timing.”
  The last time Florida had an open week 
this early in the season was 2009. That sea-
son’s bye followed a 41-7 win against Ken-tucky in which quarterback Tim Tebow suf-fered a concussion.
  Tebow used the bye to recover and re-
turned to action the following week, help-ing top-ranked Florida defeat LSU 13-3 and 
remain unbeaten. 
  Several players with minor injuries 
stand to beneﬁ  t in the same way this sea-
son. Coach Will Muschamp indicated that some players who would be questionable for a game on Saturday are likely to play against LSU on Oct. 6.
  Defensive end Dominique Easley missed 
Saturday’s win against Kentucky with 
swelling in his surgically repaired left knee. 
The time off should reduce the swelling. 
  Trey Burton also sat out against the Wildcats with back spasms and Chaz Green missed the game with an ankle injury. 
  Jordan Reed had to leave UF’s game 
against Kentucky with what Muschamp described as a “head injury,” and Sharrif 
Floyd left with a shoulder injury.
  “How much they will do this week, 
we’ll determine that as the week goes,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “But I think all of those guys should be ﬁ  ne.”
  The healthy Gators plan to use the extra 
time to try to improve their performance. Muschamp said Florida would use Tues-day and Wednesday to simply focus on self-improvement — not looking at the Ti-
gers. Florida begins preparing for LSU on 
Thursday.  
  Two speciﬁ  c areas Muschamp said 
the team plans to work on offensively are Gators using bye to heal injuries, work on self-improvement 
UF Fo otballTHE ADAM BOMB
  Florida hasn’t done anything this sea-
son.
  Well, to be fair, the Gators did what 
they were supposed to do.
  During the ﬁ  rst four weeks, Florida de-
feated a Mid-Atlantic Conference team, a squad in its season opener and ﬁ  rst-ever Southeastern Conference game, and two SEC teams against which the Gators hold extended winning streaks.
Florida may have been the underdog 
against Texas A&M and Tennessee, but Ve-gas misjudged UF’s talent advantage.
  No. 11 Florida’s next game is against a 
top-ﬁ  ve conference opponent at home dur-ing the ﬁ  rst week of October.
  Sound familiar?  Florida faced the same situation in 2011, 
playing No. 3 Alabama at home on Oct. 1. But this team is different than last year’s squad, which dropped four straight in Octo-ber. Players and coaches have said it them-selves, and I am a Will Muschamp believer.
  Here’s the catch.  The Gators play a murderers’ row of op-
ponents in October with No. 3 LSU, No. 6 South Carolina and No. 5 Georgia. No, I’m not counting the game against Vanderbilt. 
  Only UF’s matchup against Georgia is 
away from Gainesville, but Florida easily could lose all three.
  In the span of a month, the Gators moved 
from a fringe top-25 team without any play-makers to a legitimate top-15 team. Florida has scored three touchdowns of 50 yards or more in the past four weeks.
  Florida’s defense, 
which ranked No. 8 nationally in total defense last season, has started slow ev-
ery week.
  UF managed to come back in the second 
half against two conference opponents on the road. No other team in the SEC has done that this season, but this isn’t necessarily a distinction to boast about.
  Do the Gators sound too good to be true? 
They may be, but LSU represents the ﬁ  rst chance for Florida to back up the hype. 
Win or lose,   the Gators have to show 
they can contend with the SEC elite. Up to this point, Florida hasn’t done that.
  Muschamp and UF went 0-3 against LSU, 
South Carolina and Georgia last season.
  The 2009 recruiting class, headlined by 
seniors Josh Evans, Jon Bostic and Mike Gillislee, has gone 4-5 against those three teams, including a 1-2 mark in 2010.
  If this group was ever going to bring the 
Gators back, this would be the year.
  With the added experience in the start-
ing lineup — 18 starters are either juniors or seniors — Florida is better prepared to deal with the adversity that comes with playing LSU game to prove UF’s worth

The Gators are tired of hearing 
about getting outscored 72-22 in the 
fourth quarter of SEC games last season.
“It stuck in our heads,” wide re-
ceiver Frankie Hammond Jr. said last week. 
“We don’t want to have that 
score. It needs to be flipped around at the end of this season. That’s what we’re trying to do.”
Florida players and coaches are 
saying the right things. The message surrounding the football program has been one of added maturity.
There isn’t any more bickering 
in the locker room. Players actu-ally have to practice now. They’ve shown an ability to not let sluggish starts affect them.
“You’re able to rationalize a lot 
better with guys that are a little bit more mature,” Muschamp said. “You’re able to sit down, talk, un-derstand why we’ve improved, why we are where we are and what we need to do to get better.”
Where Florida is will be deter -
mined in the next month. The Gators are better than a 6-6 regular season, but a four-loss campaign isn’t out of the question for 2012.
Granted, Florida’s first four wins 
were a step in the right direction, but they’re by no means an indica-
tion this team has fixed what was 
broken. Let’s talk again on Nov. 1.

force the running back towards the middle of the defense. 
 “We’ve had the primary run-force player lose contain 
at times,” Muschamp said. “We haven’t done a good job 
replacing the primary run-force player. … A little of that is 
understanding. That all goes back on me.”
Muschamp also traced the defense’s perimeter run 
problems to the play of his cornerbacks. 
“We’ve got one that’s real excited to go tackle — 
Loucheiz Purifoy,” Muschamp said. “The rest of them have to get more excited about tackling. … A lot of times, it’s want-to.”
Purifoy leads UF’s cornerbacks with 14 tackles, but no 
other player at the position has more than eight. 
While shortcomings in the perimeter run game were 
not detrimental against Florida’s first four opponents — none of which ranked in the top 30 in rushing offense or 
top 15 in rushing defense — they could prove costly in a 
matchup against LSU on Oct. 6. 
The Tigers have the NCAA’s No. 15 rushing offense 
and No. 3 rushing defense.

As the Division I Men’s and Women’s Tennis Commit-
tee deliberated on changes to speed up the college game, 
Florida senior Bob van Overbeek reacted with three simple words: 
“This is ridiculous.”
After his initial response, van Overbeek knew some-
thing had to be done promptly, so he and Michigan’s Evan 
King took the first step and created a Facebook group to spread awareness. 
“Him and I were like, ‘We have to start the group to let 
people know, spread the word, and hopefully we can get this reversed,’” van Overbeek said.
The two decided on a group name that was simple 
and straightforward: “*OFFICIAL* Against the changes to 
NCAA tennis.”  
Within a month, the group exploded, with nearly 8,800 
people joining.
Van Overbeek realized a Facebook group was not go-
ing to stop an NCAA ruling, so he created a petition on 
Change.org to rally against the proposed 
rules changes. 
Similar to his Facebook group, van 
Overbeek wanted to be straightforward 
in describing what he was petitioning against. The first sentence of the petition made his intentions clear:
“First and foremost, the NCAA rec-
ommendations will damage the integ-rity of the sport.”
The committee wanted to change the way singles 
and doubles matches are decided in the NCAA Division I Championships. For doubles, the committee decided 
to change the match from an 8-game pro set to a 6-game 
set. For singles, the committee decided to do away with the third set and play a 10-point tiebreaker to decide the match. 
“A lot of people know that big matches are always won 
in a full third set,” van Overbeek said. 
According to the NCAA report, the changes were de-
signed to make the game more marketable and “viewer-friendly.” Some matches have lasted upwards of four-and-
a-half hours, longer than almost any other sport. 
The committee wanted to make the change to promote 
the growth of college tennis and the athletes’ health but for -
got one important aspect in its deliberation — the athletes’ 
voices.
“That’s really significant, because [the student-athletes] 
are the ones out there on the court,” UF coach Bryan Shel-ton said. “They are the ones having the real experience.”
Van Overbeek knew he had to raise his voice.
He had no idea how many people would sign his peti-
tion, but he figured it would enhance the credibility of his 
argument.
Within three weeks, the petition had 4,200 signatures.“Bob is a leader,” Shelton said. “It’s good to see him step 
up in that leadership role for something that’s really sig-nificant.”
The committee proposed these changes on Aug. 19. The 
NCAA panel rejected the tiebreaker procedures on Sept. 
13, but has elected to proceed with the plans to remove the 
warm-ups with the opponent, reduce the time between doubles play and singles play from 10 minutes to five and shorten each changeover from 90 seconds to 60.
Even though there was a strong following, van Over -
beek showed skepticism that the Facebook group and peti-tion would fuel the reversal of the tiebreaker changes. 
“I don’t know if it helped,” van Overbeek said. “The pe-
tition, maybe, just to show the NCAA that we are serious 
about it.”
Shelton, though, believes van Overbeek’s and other 
players’ opinions helped fuel the rejection. 
“When players are able to get together and do things, 
they got a strong platform,” Shelton said. 
“The person who has played the game, who follows the 
game and who understands the game is in a better position 
to make proposals on how the game is going and where we want it to go.”Senior leads fight

Gators want to improve special teams
short-yardage situations and timing on certain passing 
routes. He also added that the team would “spend a good portion” of Tuesday and Wednesday’s practices on kick-off returns and blocking punts. The Gators are 86th in the country with an average of 19.5 yards per kick return and 
have yet to block a punt this season.
“It’s always good to focus on what you can do as a 
team and play to get better, especially before a big game,” Taylor said. “The game is so far away that coach Mus-
champ said we’re going to focus on us, and get ourselves better.”
Wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr., who leads UF in 
receiving yards and touchdowns, agreed that the team still has plenty of areas to address.
“We haven’t played our best game,” Hammond said. 
“We haven’t put together our best game, so we’ve got a bye week, and we’re going to take advantage of it. We’re 
going to clean up things, penalties, whatever it may be. Pass protec-tion, just making reads, anything. We’re going to go back and look at 
the film [Sunday] and just make improvements.”
Muschamp also mentioned the downside of an early 
bye week. Florida has built significant momentum with a 4-0 start and now has to wait a week to build on it.
When asked if he preferred the bye earlier or later, 
Muschamp said he’d have to wait and see.
“I’ll tell you after LSU,” he said.Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurnovoy@alligator.org.byE , from page 13

Jo Dragotta was doing her best to keep 
her mind clear.
Florida was already up 2-0 Georgia and 
had allowed only three shots through the first 69 minutes, but Dragotta had her own pressure to deal with.
Georgia had just been called for a hand-
ball inside the penalty box, and Dragotta was lining up to take the penalty kick.
Although penalty kicks are always 
pressure-packed situations, Dragotta had 
extra weight on her shoulders. 
In her four years at Florida, she had 
never scored a goal.
“I was like, ‘Oh, this is my one shot to 
score a goal here at UF,’” she said.
With no hesitation, she took her shot, 
aimed it low at the far side of the net and 
let it rip. 
Georgia goalkeeper Ashley Baker dove 
in the opposite direction, and Dragotta jumped into the arms of teammate Havana Solaun.
“We kind of planned that,” Dragotta 
said after Sunday’s game. “I was like, ‘Ha-vana, if you score, I’m going to jump into your arms,’ and she was like, ‘OK, if you score, you can jump into my arms, too.’ Then I scored, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, 
we get to do it!’”
As a defensive midfielder, Dragotta’s 
primary job is to move the ball between 
the defenders and the attacking midfield-
ers. 
On defense, her job is to try to slow 
down opposing attacks.
“Scoring, OK, it’s exciting and stuff, but at the same time, I’d rather our team win,” 
Dragotta said.
“I admire her so much,” sophomore de-
fender Annie Bobbitt said. “How she tack-les, how she distributes the ball.”
Dragotta did not always have the role 
she has now. 
When she was in high school, she 
played midfield and forward, taking on a more active role in the offense.
While at Gaither High School in Tampa, 
she scored 24 goals in her final two sea-
sons. 
In her four years on the school’s soccer 
team, she was a three-time All-Sunshine 
Conference and All-Hillsborough County selection. 
Despite Dragotta’s lack of scoring dur -
ing her time at Florida, senior midfielder Erika Tymrak said Dragotta shows off one of the Gators’ best penalty kicks during practice.
“Jo always hits her spot,” Tymrak said. 
“She’s probably one of the most composed players on the team.”
Dragotta’s composure is something the 
rest of the team finds useful.
After defeating Tennessee on Friday, 
coach Becky Burleigh said she was disap-pointed that the team didn’t keep its com-
posure. The Gators took a 2-0 lead before fall-
ing into the Volunteers’ style of play and 
letting them pull within a goal.
Halfway through her final season at 
Florida, Dragotta said it wasn’t the big wins or accomplishments on the field that she would take with her.
“Honestly, it doesn’t even come down 
to soccer,” she said. 
“Obviously, soccer is a big part of our 
lives, but you’re with these people all the time and … it’s definitely a special bond.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

◗ WIGGS LEADS THE SEC WITH A 
.465 HITTING PERCENTAGE. 
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
Three years after taking a leap of 
faith, Tangerine Wiggs is still trying to 
stick the landing.
After playing in only 10 sets at Wash-
ington State in 2009, she transferred to 
play under coach Mary Wise and a pe-
rennial national title contender at Flor -
ida. Now, as a redshirt senior, Wiggs wants more desperately than ever to grab glory before she graduates.
“The hardest decision I ever made 
was transferring,” she said. “I’ll forever be indebted to Mary. She took a chance on me – she never saw me play. It really 
took a huge leap of faith going into the 
unknown.”
The 6-foot-4 right-side hitter has 
done everything she can this season to help her squad succeed. She leads the Southeastern Conference with a .465 hitting clip while also racking up 19 blocks.
Wise said Wiggs is playing the best 
volleyball of her career, which has helped UF climb to a No. 12 national ranking.
“She’s at the strongest point in her 
career,” Wise said. “She’s, health-wise, in good position. And she’s playing like a senior, where everything she’s doing is dedicated to our team performance and winning now. You see that sense of 
urgency in her.”
The Gators last captured an SEC title in 2010, which was Wiggs’ first year 
at Florida. After losing All-Americans Kristy Jaeckel and Kelly Murphy as well as three other seniors in the offsea-son, Wiggs said she believes this young team has a chance get back on top and end her career on a high note.
“We’re taking the steps, we’re doing 
things we need to do to be playing our best volleyball in December,” she said.
At this point last year, the Seattle na-
tive was hitting nearly 100 points lower than she  is  now. She has cut down from 20 attack errors to 14. Wise said Wiggs’ transformation has taken a few years of hard work but is paying off in her third 
and final year as a Gator.
“I think the biggest difference is that 
Tang could kill balls, but all the stars 
had to line up for that to happen,” Wise said. “Now her jump reach is higher, her strength base is better (and) her vol-leyball IQ has improved. She’s playing like a fifth-year senior.”
Wiggs’ has never finished a season 
with a hitting clip higher than .319 or as one of the Gators’ top-three attack-ers. So far this season, she’s doing both while also maintaining her role as one of the squad’s premier blockers.
Rather than focusing on the num-
bers, Wiggs said the team is determined to send the seniors out with an SEC Championship and a trip to Louisville, 
Ky., for one last shot at a national title.
“It’s bizarre thinking that every 
game I play it’s going to be the last time 
I’m going to play this team,” she said. “It’s sad, but at the same time it’s really exciting. So I just want to do the best I can to go out with a bang.”Redshirt senior thriving, trying to finish career on high note  Joe: When the sun rises in Gainesville

The Gators are 4-0 again this season, and there is plenty of room for optimism in 2012. Why?
  Two words: quality and quantity . Through 
four games, Florida has defeated three South-
eastern Conference opponents. While one win 
was a meaningless romp against Kentucky , the other two were road victories against qual-ity opponents in hostile environments. As far as the quantity argument is concerned, look at this team’s depth.
  Multiple injuries have failed to derail The 
Coach Boom Express, and with a bye week to heal, the Gators will be healthy and deep 
heading into October.
  Greg: Take a second to pump the brakes. 
  Florida’s ﬁ  rst four performances were far 
from ﬂ  awless. The win against Bowling Green was an obvious abomination, regardless of coach Will Muschamp’s plan to run the ball in suboptimal situations just because he could. Texas A&M was making its debut with a red-shirt freshman quarterback, and UF’s three-
point margin of victory says the game obvi-
ously could have gone either way. 
  Even against Tennessee, Florida relied on 
an 80-yard touchdown run by Trey Burton and a 75-yard score from Frankie Hammond Jr. It’s wrong to assume big plays will repeat themselves going forward. Plus, maybe the V olunteers aren’t as good as we all thought. They’ve played N.C. State close and were tied 
at halftime against Akron. 
  Morgan Newton’s terribleness kept Ken-
tucky from mounting any type of threat.
  Joe: But you need to consider the process, Greg. Achieving success is not an overnight venture. The game against Bowling Green  was is an anomaly . Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett were not asked to do much — aside from pooching punts and playing wide receiv-
er — for obvious reasons. Shaking offseason 
rust with a new scheme in the ground game is not a blueprint for scoring 50 points in the sea-son opener. The victories at Texas A&M and Tennessee proved that Florida, which ﬁ  nished last season 1-4 away from home in SEC play, can win on the road. The Gators rallied back from halftime deﬁ  cits against the V olunteers and the 
Aggies, both quality 
opponents. That’s a big deal, especially after last season. Florida is building and maturing, and that’s all Muschamp can really ask for just one month into the season.  Greg: Sure, UF has shown a lot of resiliency with second half comebacks, but only because slow starts have been such a consistent problem. The Gators have been outgained in the ﬁ  rst quarter of every game 
this season, as oppo-
nents have a  454-261 
edge in net yards. UF has been outrushed 164-123 and outpassed  257-130  in opening quarters, totaling a 27-14 disadvantage in ﬁ  rst downs. Early deﬁ  cits can be overcome against lesser teams, but the chore will be more difﬁ  -cult against LSU. UF also suffered from slow starts last season, so it’s hard to believe this is a totally different team. Florida also ranks No. 100 nationally with eight penalties per game after ﬁ  nishing No. 112 with 7.7 ﬂ  ags per game last season. Until those fundamental issues are 
straightened out, this team will still remind me 
of last year’s squad.   Joe: The Gators’ start slow and penalties have been problematic, but the team has made such signiﬁ  cant progress from last season that I’m inclined to believe that they can keep growing. Just look at Driskel. He went from a wild card to the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. 
Take Mike Gillislee. The guy could barely 
crack the lineup last season. Now he is argu-ably the best running back in the SEC. I’m not saying Florida is going to beat the hell out of everybody, but I do not foresee another 3-6 ﬁ  nish in 2012. The Gators have grown, they are deep and they are motivated by last sea-son’s failures. “We handle things better,” Muschamp said. Florida is far from ﬂ  awless, but for the most part, I believe him.
  Greg: Despite hot starts, Driskel and Gillislee 
have a lot left to prove before I peg them as catalysts of a turnaround. 
  Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey combined for 
182.8 yards per game on the ground in Flori-da’s 4-0 start last season before averaging only 87.4 the rest of the way . Just because Gillislee is averaging 100.5 yards per game right now doesn’t mean he’s the savior on offense and 
will enjoy the same success the rest of the year. 
As for Driskel, his hot start doesn’t look so spectacular if you take away about 100 yards after the catch and two touchdowns from Hammond. Like the team as a whole, Driskel has been better than I expected, but there’s no guarantee he keeps it up. Especially not if he makes the same types of overthrows and misreads he sprinkled into an otherwise solid 
performance against UK. 
  If Driskel, Gillislee and Florida get it done 
against LSU, then they’ll have my attention. 
But right now, it’s too early to deﬁ  nitively say this year won’t be another 2011.
