For Caitlyn Lower, cruising in 
her silver Corolla will become a little 
more complicated near her Second 
Avenue Centre apartment.
The 21-year-old UF public rela-
tions junior is one of many drivers, bikers and walkers who will be af-
fected by the closure of a Southwest 
Second Avenue block stretching 
from Southwest Seventh Terrace to Southwest 10th Street. Travelers will be redirected to Southwest Fourth 
Avenue during the project.
“I was kind of upset about it be-
cause I feel it’s going to cause a lot 
of trafﬁ  c at Fourth Avenue,” said Lower, a community assistant at the 
apartment complex. 
Workers will install a 6-foot 
storm pipe underneath Second Av-enue, along with sewers, electrical 
lines and other utilities during the 
construction, which will last from 
Monday through March 16, said project manager Diane Gilreath. 
The city hopes to upgrade infra-
structure in the area and stimulate economic development in Innova-tion Square, she said. 
“It’s part of a bigger initiative to upgrade the infrastructure in that area to serve future pending devel-
opment that’s on its way,” she said. 
“It’s really to help economic devel-opment of that section of the city.”
Youseuf Kashem, owner of Cor-
ner Store, located at 425 SW Second Ave., said the road closure will have a negative affect on business. 
“It’s going to hurt us,” he said.Construction on Second Avenue redirects trafﬁ  c

For the ﬁ  rst time in recent years, 
not all UF Student Government po-
litical parties are running an execu-tive ticket. 
The Students Party announced 
Wednesday it will not have candi-dates for Student Body President, vice president and treasurer on the ballot Feb. 18 and 19. 
But Swamp Party nominees Cory 
Yeffet, Vivan Nguyen and Elliot Gras-so won’t be running unopposed.
The newly formed Taco Libre Par-
ty, whose goal is to bring Taco Bell 
back to campus, is contending for 
executive ofﬁ  ces with Stephanie Kre-itzer for president, Juan Zapata for vice president and Micaela Montero for treasurer.
In every Spring election since 
2000, all parties have run executive candidates. In 2005, the Voice Party ran only a treasurer, according to SG voting records.
Having more than two parties, 
though, isn’t unusual. Votes have been divided among as many as ﬁ  ve parties in Spring elections in the past 14 years. For example, in 2009, there 
were four: The Unite; Orange and 
Blue; Keg; and Progress parties all participated. 
Alex Klayman, the Students Party 
spokesman, said the party decided to forgo running an executive ticket this term because it seemed to be a better use of resources.
“By focusing on the seats we 
know are winnable for the minority party, we can begin building a larger voice in the Senate,” he wrote in an email.
He said the party is focusing on 
regaining momentum after last elec-tion, in which Students Party won two Senate seats out of 50. Swamp claimed the other 48.Students Party not

UF students and faculty are reacting to the deaths of 
three people in Kiev, Ukraine, following protests around 
the capital last week. 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych’s refusal to 
join the European Union has prompted protests and riots around the country after the denial of the deal to join the 28-nation bloc, BBC reported. 
“President Yanukovych’s rejection of a deal on closer 
ties with the European Union dashed the hopes of many Ukrainians who see the best prospects for Ukraine’s future residing in stronger ties with the West,” Bryon Moraski, a 
UF political science associate professor doing research in 
Kiev, wrote in an email.
The government’s subsequent turn to Russia in December 
for an economic bailout also added fuel to the ﬁ  re. “The protests became larger and more intense when 
the government used riot police to ﬁ  ercely disperse these peaceful demonstrators, injuring some in the process,” Moraski said.
If Ukraine joined the EU, the accompanying rules and 
regulations would impede the ability of Russian businesses to maintain their existing ties and proﬁ  ts in these countries, he said.
“More recently, Lenin is known to have said that for 
Russia to lose Ukraine is comparable to a person losing his 
(or her) head,” Moraski said.UF students, faculty react to protests, violence in UkraineSEE ELECTIONS, PAGE 4

Forensics may be traditionally 
seen as a strictly human-related 
science, but a new master’s degree program at UF is extending it to four-legged companions and more.
UF’s Maples Center for Forensic 
Medicine now offers a new online master’s degree and graduate cer-
tiﬁ  cate program where students can 
take classes in veterinary forensics.
This program is the ﬁ  rst in the 
country and is provided by the UF College of Veterinary Medicine in partnership with the American So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals.
The idea was developed after 
Jason Byrd, director of education for the ASPCA Veterinary Forensic Sciences Program, helped the orga-nization with animal cruelty cases.
They started in-person work-
shops and training, which led to 
the idea that they could do it via 
distance education, Byrd said.
“There are a lot of veterinarians out there who need to know a good bit about forensic science because they’re essentially the medical ex-
aminer of the animal world,” Byrd 
said.
Through the program, students 
can receive a graduate certiﬁ  cate and a thesis or non-thesis master’s degree in veterinary forensic sci-ences.
The ASPCA helps fund the pro-
gram. In exchange, the veterinary 
forensic science team helps with its 
animal cruelty cases.
“It’s more than just the educa-
tional program,” Byrd said. “It’s ac-tually casework, which makes the educational program better.”
Will Smith, a 21-year-old UF 
biology junior, said he has wanted to be a veterinarian ever since he helped his dad perform surgery on a cat when he was ﬁ  ve years old.
In addition, Smith has taken a 
forensic science class at UF.
“I took one and it was really in-
teresting, so I think that would be really cool if they would have one for vets,” Smith said.
These programs are not just for 
veterinarians, Byrd said. Anyone can take the class as long as they have a four-year degree.
Katherine Rivera, a 20-year-
old UF animal science junior who works with animal rescues, said she would love to take a class in the program.
“I think that it’s something new 
and another direction you can go with the animal sciences,” Rivera said.
The ﬁ  rst online classes for the 
graduate certiﬁ  cate opened in Fall 2010, but January marked the start of the program’s ﬁ  rst classes in the master’s degree program.
Summer 2014 will be the ﬁ  rst 
full semester in the program, Byrd said.New vet program helps prevent cruelty

Former members of Team 
Florida Cycling will join forces 
on Saturday to honor a friend and fund a cause.
Last year the UF club lost 
Paul Corey, one of its original sponsors, who passed away June 24. Corey was heavily involved in the Gainesville cy-cling community. He owned a bike shop called the Bike Route and sponsored the cycling club through it.
In his memory, former 
members Ravi Rajcoomar, Jus-tin Gottlieb and Mike Gann or-ganized a silent-auction fund-raiser that will take place at Bike Works, 2300 SW 34th St., from 6 to 7:30 p.m.
The trio worked at the Bike 
Route under Corey while they were UF students in the 90s.  
“Paul was a mentor for all 
of us,” Rajcoomar said. “He taught us a lot of things and al-ways supported the team.”
Half of the proceeds will go 
to the Gainesville Fisher House Foundation and Team Florida Cycling, said Christian Trucco, a 34-year-old UF sustainable building construction graduate 
student and president of Team 
Florida Cycling. 
“This is a tremendous help, 
since the club is growing,” Trucco said. “The number of racers are much more than years past.”Silent auction to

 UF alumnus and codeveloper of 
Proactiv Dr. Kathy Fields will speak 
to UF students at the 17th annual Medical College Forum.
The Medical College Forum on 
Feb. 8 will allow people interested in the medical field to be one step clos-er to their career by offering the op-portunity for students to meet with medical school admissions directors and a medical student panel.
The MCF is sponsored by UF’s 
chapter of the American Medical 
Student Association and will be held 
at the University of Florida College of Medicine.
Zachary Field, 22-year-old UF 
biology senior and a Medical Col-lege Forum director, said the direc-tors decided to chose Fields as the keynote speaker because she was once in the shoes 
of many of the 
aspiring medical 
students. 
Fields was an 
undergrad at UF and was told by many pre-med advisers that she 
couldn’t get into medical school and to switch her major. But Fields went on to create one of the most success-ful skincare brands in the world, Field said.
“It’d be great for her to talk about 
the persistence and the drive,” Field 
said. “If you want to go into medi-
cine, do it wholeheartedly and don’t let anybody stop you.”
Other speakers include AMSA 
national president Nida Degesys, a panel of students in medical schools around the nation and presentations by admissions directors.Students will get a chance to hear 
directly from the people who deter-
mine whether they get accepted into 
medical school, Field said.
Zara Zaidi, 20-year-old applied 
physiology and kinesiology junior, said she hopes to learn about the school she’ll be applying to.
“It gives you a realistic feel of 
what the application process in-volves and what each individual school requires,” Zaidi said.

Gainesville Police arrested a home-
less man Wednesday after police said he 
locked himself in a Wal-Mart bathroom and huffed aerosol cans.
Officers arrested 27-year-old Joshua 
Robert Padgett on charges of petit theft and trespassing, according to an arrest report.
At about 11 a.m., an employee of the 
Butler Plaza Wal-Mart found Padgett passed out on the floor of the men’s rest-room, said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias. He had an empty can of com-pressed air with him.  Officers found empty cans in the 
bathroom stall and a full can in his jacket. The cans were worth about $25 total.
Padgett admitted to 
stealing the cans and 
inhaling them until he 
was unconscious, ac-
cording to the report.
In November, 
Wal-Mart employees trespassed Padgett. Padgett told officers he knew he wasn’t 
supposed to be on the property. 
Officers booked Padgett into the jail, 
where he remained in lieu of a $22,000 bond.Man huffs air in Wal-Mart � IT’S FROM 10 P.M. TO MIDNIGHT.

More than a dozen of Gainesville’s hottest 
hunks will be auctioned off tonight to raise 
money for one local gym’s charitable mission.
The Ark School of Fitness in East Gainesville 
will be hosting its first Ark’s Angels Man Pag-
eant from 10 p.m. to midnight at the gym locat-
ed at 22 NE 11th St. The pageant aims to raise money for the gym’s mission of constructing strength and flexibility fitness parks in town.
The audience can get acquainted with each 
contestant before bidding, said pageant coordi-nator Jen Ambrose. Winners will then go out on a date with their man. 
Michael Espinosa, a head coach and owner 
of The Ark, said the audience should expect to have an entertaining night and also learn about key points revolving around the gym commu-nity through skits in-between contestants.
Espinosa said he’s also participating.“I think I’m going to be slightly humili-
ated,” he said. “I know I’m going to have a lot of fun.”
Caleb Whitfield, a head coach at CrossFit 
Gainesville and pageant contestant, said he volunteered for the entertainment and educa-tional value.
“Being able to tap into the large network of 
people I have at my own gym to come over and support me is only going to help raise more money,” Whitfield said.
Whitfield said he believes the money being 
raised is going toward a good cause.
“We’re going to entertain with some skits 
that are going to deliver a heart-warming mes-sage,” he said. “Then we’re going to show off our manly goods in skimpy swimwear.”Fitness hunks to be auctioned off
Some think police force brutality distracts from actions of protestors
Fred Kolb, a UF Model 
United Nations team member, 
said he agrees with most of the 
international community in 
condemning the violent responses of the Ukrainian government. 
“It’s shameful that the country 
seems to be returning to its ways from the Cold War that has been over for over two decades,” Kolb, a 20-year-old UF economics and 
political science junior, wrote 
in an email. “The majority of the protests have been peaceful, and the brutal methods of the Ukrainian police forces are now 
in the spotlight rather than the 
actions of the protestors.” 
Bardia Khajenoori, a 20-year-
old UF international studies 
and political science junior, 
said he believes the Ukrainian government has lost legitimacy through its recent actions.
“The people have spoken in 
favor of a pro-western direction and to ignore their will is simply undemocratic,” Khajenoori wrote in an email. 
Moving away from Russia 
and into the western sphere of influence could have very real 
consequences for Ukraine, he 
said.
“Yanukovych was clearly 
extending his powers beyond 
what the public was willing to 
allow,” Khajenoori said, “and he responded with violence and repression when they 
demonstrated against it.”UkRAine , from page 1The Taco Libre executive candidates will run against Swamp
“There’s no denying our party took a large hit last semes-
ter,” he said. ”The way to rebuild, we believe, is not to over-
extend ourselves ... but to pinpoint the (races) we know can provide fruitful outcomes for us.”
Klayman said this strategy will promote awareness of po-litical agendas on campus.
“Doing so will hopefully not only allow us to run a more ef-
ficient campaign, but also open students’ eyes to the incredibly one-party dominated system that governs the Student Body,” he said.
Susan Webster, the Swamp Party spokeswoman, said the 
absence of a Students Party executive ticket will not change Swamp’s campaign strategy. 
“The Swamp Party will continue to reach out to all students 
throughout campus to ensure that all students’ voices are heard,” she wrote in an email. 
Kreitzer said Taco Libre’s approach to elections stands out 
because it is operating on a $0 campaign budget. The party will mostly be using social media to spread the word.eleCTiOnS , from page 1Padgett

Gainesville Fashion Week is look-
ing for models who can strut, but or-
ganizers think local talent might be shivering instead.
Chin Chin Hao, event director and 
a UF telecommunication senior, said the recent cold front has posed an obstacle for promoting Gainesville Fashion Week’s seventh season.
Promotion largely involves ap-
proaching potential models, design-ers and attendees when they go out in Midtown or downtown, but or-ganizers believe the cold weather is 
keeping students from venturing out 
to bars and clubs.  “A bunch of us went out (on 
Wednesday), and Wednesday is typically a big night in Midtown, but there was no one out,” said Rachel Godfrey, a GFW social media intern and 21-year-old UF journalism se-
nior. “It makes it difﬁ  cult for us.” 
This prompted GFW to alter its 
promotional techniques. 
For the ﬁ  rst time, organizers are 
incorporating a designer casting call 
into its model casting call on Satur-day.
Scouts from Premiere Model 
Management, a professional model-ing agency, will also attend the call to provide additional incentive for models, Hao said.
To spread the word to those un-
willing to brave the cold, the team handed out ﬂ  iers at the gym and is 
sending them to UF resisdence hall 
mailboxes.
GFW has also been increasing its 
social media presence to get the mes-sage out.
“We’re constantly producing con-
tent, so even if we can’t reach people in person, we can do it through so-cial media,” Godfrey said.
Despite the cold, GFW is aggres-
sively promoting the events, said Alyssa Fisher, director of marketing and promotions.  
“The new producers this year are 
very organized,” Fisher said. “They want to make sure that everyone is on top of everything.” Fashion week hotties staying in due to cold
“Because we face these 
obstacles, we’ve developed 
new methods of marketing 
and promoting.”

of art will be put up for auction at its seventh annual Moonlight and Martinis gala Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Mercedes Benz of Gainesville, located at 4000 N. Main St. 
“We run at a deﬁ  cit every year,” said Robin Katz, 
program director at Al’z Place. “The goal of this event is to raise as much money as we can to continue to provide services to the seniors of Alachua County.” 
The gala will have about 500 guests in attendance 
and is expected to raise about $60,000, Katz said. The paintings will be among several prizes available for auction, some of which include jewelry, a trip to St. Augustine and a guitar signed by members of the 
band Sister Hazel. 
Although the paintings through Art Without 
Boundaries raise signiﬁ  cant funds, Katz said that’s 
not the main reason Al’z Place continues with the 
program every year.  It’s about the therapeutic value 
it has to its clients. 
“They get that great feeling about the work that 
they’ve done,” she said. “Through music and move-ment and directed painting, our (seniors) each create 
these wonderful works of art.”
Mary Ellen Futch, a caregiver and certiﬁ  ed nurs-
ing assistant who works at Al’z Place, said she no-
tices a great change in the seniors after they complete 
their paintings.
“They don’t think they’re artists until they get 
through, and then they’re amazed at what they can 
do,” said Futch, an employee of 20 years. “They seem to be more verbal because they’ve done something 
they’re very proud of.”Art auction to

Despite it being cold enough to see our breath in our bed-
rooms, no snow fell in Gainesville — just tons of annoying, literally freezing rain. To make matters worse, while we were 
trudging to class with our hoods up, our friends at FSU en-
joyed a snow day. Plus, Facebook is still sluggish from iPhone 
screenshot overload.
We guess the rest of the week was all right, but we’ve never 
been more ready for the weekend. 
So here it is: your we’re-Beliebers-in-second-chances edi-
tion of...

Tap, tap, tap... death. Start over. 
Are you guys playing Flappy Bird as obsessively as we are? 
The free app is the worst (best?) thing to ever happen to the 
Alligator staff. The game is super simple, super addicting and 
super infuriating. We swear we didn’t hit that pipe, and for 
that, we throw a our-score-is-lower-than-our-GPA DART to 
Flappy Bird. Ugh. We just can’t quit you.
In other serious news, a new political party has emerged 
on campus. UF Student Government’s upcoming elections will now feature three groups: Swamp, Students and Taco Libre, 
the last of which has one platform point: Get Taco Bell back at UF. 
Although cheap Tex-Mex is delicious, we’re more intrigued 
to see how elections play out with three parties. After all, 
George Washington once warned about bipartisanship, saying, 
“The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharp-ened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissention . . . is 
itself a frightful despotism.” We recognize that creating more 
parties isn’t necessarily a solution to that, but we digress — a 
this-should-make-for-a-strange-debate LAUREL to the Taco 
Libre Party for keeping things interesting.
Next, let’s talk about UF Online. The concept is great — ev-
eryone likes expanding the Gator Nation — but as we reported 
earlier this week, it’s negatively impacting some on-campus, 
traditional students. Almost every staffer at the Alligator has 
taken an online course, so we feel for them: Online classes just aren’t as good as in-person ones. They’re easier to blow off, 
you don’t get to know your professors, and it’s difﬁ  cult to stay 
interested. Add in the weird test-taking methods like having to show a virtual proctor your room via webcam, and it’s ce-
mented: We’re tossing an if-you-got-in-to-traditional-UF-you-
shouldn’t-have-to-take-classes-designed-for-UF-Online DART  
to the university.
Moving on, we throw a quick you-are-such-a-bro LAUREL  
to Vice President Joe Biden for being an awesome addition to 
our State of the Union drinking games. Also a the-real-world-makes-us-want-to-puke DART to today’s graduation applica-
tion deadline. Blech.
Finally, we hand a thank-you-thank-you-thank-you LAU-
REL to all of our readers who downloaded the Alligator app 
this week. Whether you’re student, alumnus or just a nice per-son, we appreciate your support. We worked crazy hard to get 
it off the ground — looking at you, Matt Riva — and sincerely 
think it’ll change the way you get news. If you don’t have it yet, visit bit.ly/1gh6vtc or search “the Alligator” on the App Store 
or Google Play.
That’s enough shameless self-promotion for this week. 
Have a fantastic weekend, and go Gators!

Flappy Bird?Today’s question: Will the Second Avenue 
construction mess you up?Netﬂ  ix: Why net neutrality matters
They say that when we landed on the moon, the scien-
tists who got us there used computers with less pro-cessing power than what’s in an iPhone. This implies 
that everyone who has a computer today has an opportunity to do something awesome. It also implies they’re probably wasting that opportunity, consuming massive quantities of porn or binge watching series on Netﬂ  ix — or a weird com-bination of the two. 
I barely know how to use a computer. I’ve heard that ev-
erything is free now if you know how to torrent, but I’m too lazy to ﬁ  gure out how to do that. And I’m on my parents’ Netﬂ  ix account, so I can afford to be lazy. And like many stu-dents, I spend an alarming amount of time watching shows and movies there. 
Netﬂ  ix is powerful, and it’s gaining inﬂ  uence as the most 
successful Internet streaming and rental service. It’s gotten so huge that now it’s competing directly with traditional TV channels. Its original content is getting accolades and awards; “House of Cards” won three Emmys and a Golden Globe last year. The company already decimated one indus-try — have you been inside a Blockbuster lately? — and it looks like they’re on their way to dominating another. 
At least, that’s what they thought.Netﬂ  ix’s advance is deﬁ  nitely going to be slowed down 
because Verizon just won a pretty big court case. Basically, this case was a ﬁ  ght over “net neutrality.” Net neutrality is the concept that Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, shouldn’t charge more money for certain kinds of internet use. Verizon called out the Federal Communications Commission, saying they didn’t have the right to regulate net neutrality, and the judges agreed with them.
This is bad for Netﬂ  ix, and it’s bad for people who use 
Netﬂ  ix. It’s bad for everyone, actually. Verizon had Netﬂ  ix in mind when they sued the FCC, because streaming video over the Internet uses a lot of data — data Verizon could be making oodles of money from, if the FCC would allow them. Now, ISPs are free to charge ad-
ditional rates for streaming, or to charge Netﬂ  ix a bunch of money for the data that its customers use. Either way, Netﬂ  ix users are going to get stuck with higher bills, be-cause both situations require Netf-lix to tweak its business model. 
In fact, they’ve already begun 
a process of raising prices without 
making everyone’s heads explode with rage. It’s inﬂ  uenced by Goldilocks and psychological manipulation. They’re go-ing to offer three levels of service: below average, regular and premium. As long as they set the prices for the premium and below average cleverly, they’ll be able to charge whatever they want for the regular service, and people will still buy it. Which is convenient, because that’s what most customers will be getting anyway. 
But this shouldn’t make Netﬂ  ix the bad guy. If Netﬂ  ix 
does increase its prices, that’s the ISPs’ fault, not theirs. Win-ning the lawsuit was a strategic victory and a power grab for Verizon and ISPs everywhere, allowing them to put some pressure on the elusive web company that threatens the fu-ture of cable television. 
Luckily, it seems there’s hope for the restoration of order. 
The three justices that handed down the decision stated that they believe in net neutrality. The issue was that the FCC was enforcing it in the wrong way. And popular opinion is in fa-vor net neutrality, too. A recent survey showed that people hate ISPs more than the oil, banking and health industries. 
Not having net neutrality places an enormous amount 
of power in the hands of ISPs over Internet businesses and Internet users. Allowing them to have so much sway over the industry stiﬂ  es competition and innovation, and it has consequences for everyone with a computer.

Qualified full slate
My name is Susan Webster, and I current-
ly serve as the Swamp Party spokeswoman. I 
am very excited to announce that our party’s slate has been released. After three days of qualifying, slating and interviews, Swamp 
Party is conﬁ  dent that we have selected the 
50 most qualiﬁ  ed and capable candidates to serve the student body in the Student Sen-ate.
This year, 644 students participated in 
the slating process in hopes of getting slated, and 539 of those students slated with Swamp Party. We appreciate and thank all of the students who came to slate with us over the 
three-day period. We heard many excellent 
ideas from all of those who came to slating.  After a rigorous decision-making process, we decided on the 50 candidates that we felt were best suited for each position. It is not easy to make such decisions, 
especially here at the University of Florida where we have so many accomplished and 
qualiﬁ  ed people applying to slate. 
The entire Swamp Party Executive Board 
is excited for the slate we are presenting and 
believe that these candidates compliment what is an already a powerful executive ticket for the upcoming election. As always, we held to our tradition of selecting experi-enced and determined leaders to represent the students. Student Government is a very 
important part of the UF community and 
plays a vital role in the continued advance-ment of student life. We are proud to an-nounce our full, qualiﬁ  ed senate slate for the Spring 2014 elections.
Thank you, and vote Swamp.
Susan Webster
Swamp Party spokeswoman Women underrepresented in UF School 
of Architecture 
I am in my last semester of the graduate 
program here at the UF School of Architec-
ture. 
Looking back, I have had a great education 
in how to design a building, but with regard 
to where architecture ﬁ  ts into the context of 
our country and culture, it is striking how under represented women are in the curricu-lum, guest speakers and faculty.
In four years at the SoA, I have had three 
female professors. When assigned precedent studies to research, less than 3 percent were buildings designed by women. 
In classes where current practicing archi-
tects were called in to speak, in some cases weekly, less than 2 percent have been wom-en. 
Also, in the UF SoA lecture series there is again an imbalance. 
I believe this experience to be dispropor-
tionate to the contribution that women have been making to the profession for close to 500 
years. 
In 2011, the National Architectural Ac-
crediting Board reported that 41 percent of 
architecture degrees were earned by women, and 20 percent of licensed architects in the US were women. 
We have a dedicated and talented faculty 
in the SoA, and my intention is not to impugn the efforts already being made by them and 
the university to address this issue.
Instead I want to share my personal ex-
perience and express my concern for the cul-
tural messages and externalities which are intrinsically associated with this imbalance.

The weekend is ﬁ  nally here, and I’m more excited about it than usual because this Sunday is Super Bowl Sunday! Who cares if the half-time performer is Bruno Mars? Who cares if it’s going to 
be freezing at the MetLife Stadium? Who actually cares if the Seahawks or the Broncos win? Not me, because I don’t even like football. But I love 
Super Bowl Sunday, because I love food — namely, pizza.
Pizza hits one of its highest sale days on 
Super Bowl Sunday, according to pizza.com. 
Last year Dominos delivered enough pizzas to stretch across more than 5,000 football ﬁ  elds. This year alone the company is expecting to deliver more than 11 million pizzas Sunday. 
Pizza has been around since about 600 B.C. 
— a long time. There’s some debate about its 
exact place of origin, but Lombardi’s, the ﬁ  rst 
documented pizzeria in the United States, opened in New York City in 1905, and it’s still open. Because people love pizza.
“But what’s so great about pizza?” you may ask. And if that’s the 
case, I don’t think we can be friends. But I’ll tell you what’s great about pizza: It’s versatile, it’s practical and it’s delicious.
Considering the number of people at any given Super Bowl party, 
and the different preferences each person has, it must be hard for any host to accommodate so many pallets. I have a theory that there’s a kind pizza out there for even the pickiest of eaters.
Think about the number of Super Bowl parties you’ve been to, the 
number of people who have been there with you and the different pref-erences each person has. Now think about hard it must be for any host to accommodate so many palates. 
With pizza, the possibilities are endless. There’s deep dish, thin crust, 
stuffed crust, hand tossed, brick oven, coal ﬁ  red — you get the picture. And those are just styles. Toppings offer an entirely different realm of possibilities. From meat lover to vegetarian, I bet you can think of at least ten different topping combinations. Even if you stick to plain ol’ cheese, Papa John alone offers about ﬁ  ve different kinds to choose from.
I can’t think of any other foods that have as many customization op-
tions as pizza, and that’s just one perk.
With get-togethers as big as the ones happening on Superbowl Sun-
day, there’s one thing that’s always on everyone’s mind — pizza. Just kidding. I’m talking about money, which brings me to pizza. It’s so af-fordable. One large pizza can feed at least eight people if everyone eats just one slice.
Who am I kidding? It’s kind of unrealistic to assume rowdy football 
viewers will satisfy their hunger with just a slice each, think about stress 
eating, but that’s no reason to assume getting pizza for the game will 
break the bank. There’s always a pizza sale somewhere. From pizza chains to frozen pizzas, sales are big for Super Bowl Sunday.
DiGiorno is already offering buy-two-get-one-free coupons online 
for the big day. Even if you’re not planning on watching the game, what college student won’t beneﬁ  t from stocking up on frozen pizzas?
Let’s say you are watching the Super Bowl, though, because that’s 
the basis of my entire column this week. Let’s say you’re really invested in the game, one of your roommates is from Seattle and the other one is from Denver. You’re scared of what would happen if you left the room, so you can’t be bothered to get yourself anything to eat while it’s on, not even during commercials. Good thing Bruno Mars is performing, because none of you like that guy or his music, which means half time is the perfect time to get pizza, something you all agree on.
In the words of a wise tweet by @DiGiornoPizza “<3 -- is this symbol 
a sideways heart or a sideways piece of pizza? same thing.”

opinions@alligator.orgDuring Tuesday’s State of the 
Union address, I was proud to hear our president talk about the 
issues that matter to Americans, especial-ly those that impact us as students. From 
the skyrocketing cost of college to the im-
portance of raising the minimum wage, the vision the president laid out last night is distinctly American: infused with the optimism and pragmatism that has always kept our nation moving forward.  
By making the issues so important to our genera-
tion a priority, president Barack Obama has commit-ted to leading our nation to a bright future. We know that the cost of college is unacceptably high, and it 
isn’t going to go down overnight. But this president 
has put college affordability front and center, from creating a College Scorecard to helping inform stu-dents about ﬁ  nancial aid opportunities, to keeping student loan rates low. When Republicans in Con-gress were ready to abandon us by doubling interest rates, Obama stood up for us and saved money for students across the country.
As a student with federal loans out to ﬁ  nance my 
education, I am proud to have a president who stands up for me. More than 40 million Americans have stu-dent loan debt. Obama understands the importance of making college affordable for everyone.  
Notably, the president also discussed that Con-gress needs to step up to boost our econ-omy and help the American people. By heeding the president’s call and raising the minimum wage, Congress would af-ﬁ  rm that it is unacceptable for a person to 
work full time and live below the poverty 
line. Raising the minimum wage is especially impor-
tant to young people, because many rely on hourly jobs to help pay for their educations.
Along these same lines, Congress should immedi-
ately renew emergency unemployment insurance. In Florida, people have lost these vital beneﬁ  ts. Without unemployment insurance, these people may struggle to put food on the table for their families and lack re-
sources like gas money to effectively search for jobs. 
Obstructionist Republicans are blocking these bills in Congress, and we should stand up to them — now is not the time to play political games while hurting our economy.
Throughout his presidency, Obama has fought to 
expand opportunity for all Americans — especially young people. As a College Democrat, I’m ﬁ  red-up to continue to stand with Obama in this ﬁ  ght. It’s our 
responsibility to hold Congress and Washington ac-
countable to ensure that our futures are as bright as they can be.

With the Chinese New Year starting to-
day, UF students and local businesses are cel-
ebrating around town.  
Although some organizations have al-
ready recognized the holiday, which marks  the start of the year of the horse, others are gearing up for the new year — one of the more traditional Chinese holidays.
Yima Guo, a manager at Small House Chi-
nese Restaurant, said he’s seen an increase in reservations.
The restaurant, located at 1120 W. Univer-
sity Ave., will serve its usual menu items, but 
Guo said dumplings and ﬁ  sh are a favorite 
around this time because they are symbolic of a united family and prosperity for the com-ing year.
Guo said he will not be observing the holi-
day with his friends like most will this new year. Instead, he’ll be working at the restau-rant.
“We have to take care of the people who 
come to celebrate,” he said.The holiday came early to the Reitz Union 
on Saturday, when the Chinese American 
Student Association held a celebration.
This year, the annual celebration featured 
a show called “The Scarlet Tale” that includ-
ed storytelling through skit, song and dance. The Meihua Student Association of Mar-
tial Arts followed with a mixed-martial arts 
demonstration, and the celebration ended 
with various music and dance performances, wrote Melody Hung, a 20-year-old UF mar-keting sophomore and multimedia coordina-
tor for CASA, in an email.  
Later that weekend, the Chinese Student 
Association, a group of Chinese students 
studying abroad at UF, recognized the holi-day with singing, Chinese foods and tradi-
tional dances. One such dance was the lion 
dance, where performers dressed up and 
mimicked the motions of a lion.
“Because of the new year’s show, I feel the 
atmosphere as in China,” said member Yuan Linfang, a 24-year-old UF education gradu-
ate student. “I think that it’s a very good way 
to get Chinese students together.”Culinary Arts Student Union held a new 
year’s celebration Wednesday evening, giv-ing participants the opportunity to prepare a 
variety of Asian dishes. 
Club president Steven Che said he showed 
attendees how to make meals like Vietnam-
ese chicken salad and Cantonese fried milk 
before they were invited to prepare the dish-
es themselves.
“Everyone enjoyed the food,” the 21-year-
old UF food science and human nutrition 
sophomore said. “Nothing was bad-tasting.”
China’s state-run television station will 
show a four-hour New Year’s broadcast from China today, and students can watch online. 
Even with the local festivities, Qi Pengxu, 
a 24-year-old UF chemistry graduate student, 
said the New Year’s celebration in Gainesville 
doesn’t compare to home. 
Qi said he talks more often to his family in 
China around the holiday to feel more con-
nected.
“I am Skyping every day to see how my 
family is preparing at home,” he said. “It 
gives me relief from being homesick.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 31, 2014

Children aged 5 to 7 from the Hua-Gen Chinese School perform during the Spring Fes-
tival Gala at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom on Sunday night. The event is hosted by the Chinese Student Association in celebration of the Chinese New Year.
LOCALUF students celebrate Chinese New Year with food, dances
Traditions of Chinese New Year
• The public holiday lasts three days in China, but the celebrations continue over a 
15-day period.• Family meals are traditional, especially the New Year’s Eve feast.• The 15-day celebration is made up of multiple traditions, ranging from visiting in-laws to staying home to welcome good fortune.• An ancient custom of lighting bamboo stalks on ﬁ  re to ward off evil spirits has trans-formed into more modern ﬁ  reworks displays, particularly on Chinese New Year.• The new year concludes with a lantern festival, which features displays and night 
parades of painted lanterns. The highlight is the Dragon Dance, where dragons 
made of paper, bamboo and silk and hoisted overhead as they “dance” along the parade routes.

WITH FREE THROWS.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN

The Gators were battered 
and bloodied Thursday night in 
Starkville, Miss., but coach Billy Donovan and company escaped with their 12th straight win despite an ugly first half, defeating Missis-sippi State 62-51.
No. 3 Florida (18-2, 7-0 South-
eastern Conference) came out of the gates sluggish against Mississippi State (13-7, 3-4 SEC) by starting the game shooting 10 of 27 from the field, including just 3 of 12 from be-hind the three-point arc.
At the end of 20 minutes, the 
Gators, who crushed the Bulldogs in the Humphrey Coliseum by 35 points last year, only held a slim 27-
26 lead after allowing MSU to end 
the half on an 8-0 run.
“I thought offensively we just 
struggled moving the ball, catch-
ing the ball (and) passing the ball,” 
Donovan said. “We bobbled a lot of 
plays, we didn’t finish plays around the basket. There was no flow for us offensively.”
To add to Florida’s offensive 
woes, when the Gators penetrated and forced the Bulldogs to foul, they struggled to earn free points at the charity stripe. Florida sunk 8 of its 19 attempts from the line, which was the lowest percentage from the team all season.
Fortunately for Florida, Missis-
sippi State also had its worst night of the season from the free throw line by shooting just 1 of 6.
“For tonight, the big key, I 
thought, was the free throw battle,” Donovan said. “We definitely took more free throws. The problem was we shot 42 percent from the free-throw line.”
However, the second half brought 
a second chance for the Gators to re-deem themselves on offense.Michael Frazier II started the 
contest by missing his first six three-point attempts, including three wide-

The sun stayed home on 
Thursday. A brisk sub-40 
temperature combined with 
the occasional raindrop made 
for a dreary day of baseball at McKethan Stadium. 
Despite the weather and a 
sub-.500 record from last sea-son, the No. 23 Gators had rea-son for optimism.
Injuries healed, and the 
underclassmen that went 
through growing pains in 
2013 were another year older. Besides redshirt junior right-hander Karsten Whitson being 
back from a shoulder surgery 
that sidelined him all of 2013, 
the biggest storyline 15 days 
away from the opener is the health of Florida’s infield.
“We’re really confident. We 
came in second in [conference play] in fielding percentage,” third baseman Josh Tobias 
said. 
“We literally have the same 
infield back, and we don’t 
make a lot of errors, which is what you focus on in prac-
tice.”
Casey Turgeon, who 
notched a .268 average in 2013, 
mans his usual second base 
while shortstop Richie Mar-
tin, first baseman Zack Pow-ers and Tobias round out the infield.
Martin, who hit .300 in his 
freshman season, suffered a 
fractured right index finger on 
March 3, taking away Florida’s most consistent hitter for 20 games while Turgeon shifted 
over to shortstop. The lineup 
shuffling made it difficult for an undermanned Gators team to get in sync.
“We’re going to lean on 
them. They’re our veterans,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Obviously Richie is only a sophomore, but he played in 
just about every game he was 
able to last year other than the games he was injured. Josh and Casey are now juniors, and we’re going to lean on 
them. Defensively, we should 
be really solid in the infield.”
New faces, same place: 
Watching the Gators practice 
just two weeks before the Val-
entine’s Day opener involved layering up to combat the cold and checking a numbered ros-ter to figure out new players. 
Of the 35 Gators listed, 17 
are either freshmen or trans-fers. Florida, at least until the season opener, is a living Ab-
bott & Costello sketch for any-
one willing to brave the cold. Who is on first?Health playing major

The Gators stopped the Crimson Tide from extending 
its winning streak to three while making threes of their 
own.
For the second consecutive game, Florida had a strong 
showing from the field, shooting 46.3 percent on field goals and 45 percent from three-point range to defeat Alabama 75-67 win on Thursday night in the O’Connell Center. “This is who we are,” coach Amanda Butler said. “This 
is why we continue to shoot the way that we have and 
encouraged the shots that we have from our players that 
need to be taking those.” 
Redshirt senior Lily Svete had a whale of a game, scor-
ing 14 points — one point shy of tying her career high — and notching a career-high seven rebounds. 
Her numbers have improved dramatically since being 
removed from a starting role.“I think Lily’s been shooting the ball better since she’s 
been coming off the bench and having a chance to catch her breath, watch the flow of the game and insert herself 
in a very impactful way,” Butler said. 
Added Svete: “To start conference play, I went through Strong shooting gives Gators edge over Crimson Tide

With the longest season of her 
career behind her, Hannah Rogers 
is ready to return to the pitching circle.
After sweeping Southeastern 
Conference play last season and reaching the Women’s College World Series despite being pro-jected to ﬁ  nish fourth in the SEC before the season began, the se-nior right-handed pitcher is look-ing ahead to her next endeavor.
“You don’t really have any-
thing on your shoulders, so you 
can just go out there and prove 
people wrong and just do your thing and go about your business instead of worrying about what people are saying about you,” Rogers said about last season. 
“I guess that’s just like our mo-
tive this year too — not worry too much about what people are say-
ing and just kind of do our busi-
ness and let our work show what we can do.”
In 2013, Rogers paced Florida 
with 33 wins and 243 strikeouts, both of which led the SEC and ranked fourth and 35th in the na-tion, respectively.
Rogers’ play last year earned 
her a spot on the Top 50 Watch List for the 2014 USA Softball Col-legiate Player of the Year award, the Amateur Softball Association of America announced Wednes-day.
D e s p i t e 
the accolade, the thought 
of possibly 
being the top player in the nation 
does not cross her mind.
“It’s a good feeling, but I’m 
not really worrying about it too much,” Rogers said. “I try not to think about those kind of things.”
Rogers’ ﬁ  rst three years with 
UF have already placed her into 
Florida’s record books. 
The Lake Wales native is tied 
with Stephanie Brombacher with 
97 career wins, second only to Stephanie Nelson’s 133 victories from 2006-2009. Rogers also has 
Florida’s sixth-lowest career ERA 
(1.64) and the seventh-most strike-
outs per seven-inning game (6.10) 
through the 764.2 innings she has 
pitched as a Gator. 
Junior right-handed pitcher 
and ﬁ  rst baseman Lauren Haeger, who also made the watch list, has enjoyed sharing the mound with Rogers for the past two years.
“We just feed off each other 
really well and it is cool that this 
will be our third season together, 
so we know each other,” Haeger said.
 “It can only get better from 
here.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 31, 2014

The last time Florida (3-0, 2-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) competed against Oklahoma 
(3-0, 1-0 Big 12), UF won its ﬁ  rst NCAA title at 197.575, and OU was a close runner-up at 197.375.
In tonight’s home meet, the tables have 
turned. As of Monday, Oklahoma holds the No. 1 ranking in the nation with a team aver-age of 197.317. Florida is ranked second with an average of 197.258. 
At 7 p.m., the top two teams in the nation 
will face off in the O’Connell Center for Flor-ida’s second home meet of the season. 
But Bridget Sloan, the 
SEC Co-Gymnast of the Week (along with Kytra Hunter), is not worried about the rankings. 
“Yes they’re ranked No. 
1 right now, and we’re No. 
2,” Sloan said. “But it really 
comes down to who can hold that for the end 
of the season.” 
Coach Rhonda Faehn noted that UF’s Big 
12 rival will bring its A-game to the O’Dome.
“Oklahoma is a tremendously talented team,” Faehn said. “They are, of course, go-ing to come in and try and do their best as we are.” 
Both teams have three wins under their 
belts, but one will leave the O’Connell Center with a less than perfect record. 
“We’re just going to focus on loving being 
at home,” Faehn said. “We need to get that O’Dome packed just like it was last Friday 
because that gave so much energy to our ath-
letes; they really just fed off of it.”
The crowd of more than 10,000 fans pro-
duced enough energy for Florida to break records left and right, including notching two back-to-back perfect 10s on the ﬂ  oor from Sloan and Hunter. That is not to say Florida’s overall performance against Georgia was ﬂ  awless. 
“Our athletes are just going to focus on 
cleaning up landings and hitting,” Faehn said. “If we’re able to do that we should be able to come away with the win.” 
Hosting the team that once stood between 
them and the national championship has 
brought back memories of that fateful day in 
April for some Gators.
“Nationals is in the back of our minds,” 
Hunter said. “I mean we’re not getting ahead of ourselves, but you know we also want to be back-to-back natty champs.”

Svete’s seven boards on Thursday tied a 
team high. Although Svete had an unchar-acteristic night on the boards, Florida still 
lost the rebounding battle 40-34.
“I take a lot of pride in boxing out, and 
I’m happy that I got seven rebounds, but 
I probably gave up more rebounds than I 
ever have in a game,” Svete said. “It’s kind of bittersweet.”
Nine of Svete’s 14 points came from be-
yond the arc, but the most impressive stat 
of the night for the senior was that she con-
verted her first three-point foul play of her career after draining the free throw after a layup with 9:20 remaining. 
“Lily regularly practices that move,” Butler joked. 
“The part that she practices in practice 
is yelling, ‘And one!’”Carlie Needles also had a hot hand 
against Alabama. The redshirt sophomore scored a team-high 16 points, sinking five threes in the process. 
“I got to give the credit to my team-
mates,” Needles said. “I can’t shoot those without getting the ball. I felt like we did 
really well at extra passes. Skip passes 
were really there for us. We worked on corner threes a lot, and that’s where a lot of the shots came from.”
There were similarities both Auburn 
and Alabama shared that were conducive to Florida’s strong offensive performances in both games. 
“Both teams play a lot of zone,” But-
ler said. “Their zones are very different, 
though. Auburn mixes up their zones a lot, 
and Alabama was pretty much more of a 
straightforward, 2-3 team. It has allowed 
us to get in a little bit of a groove in our preparation of doing a lot of zone looks, getting up a lot of zone shots. It kind of generates expectations of where we think 
we’re going to be open.”
With the Crimson Tide now receding 
back to Tuscaloosa, Ala., Butler and her 
Gators hope to see more zone defense and 
keep the wave rolling into Oxford, Miss. 
“We knew we were going to have to play 
with no gaps in our toughness to do what 
we needed to do tonight,” Butler said. 
“It’s going to be a very similar battle, I 
believe, at Ole Miss.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Left-hander A.J. Puk, one of those freshmen, will play first 
and pitch. Puk, who wears No. 10, lifted a fastball off left-
hander Danny Young for a solo home run into the bullpen 
during Thursday’s scrimmage.
“I don’t think there is a true senior on our roster. [Leader-
ship is] going to be from us juniors and redshirt juniors. I’m 
looking forward to it,” catcher Taylor Gushue said. “It’s go-ing to be exciting. We don’t have all the answers to the test, 
but we sure got a lot of them.”
Tobias hits the weights: A rash 
of injuries, from a broken hand at the 
end of his freshman year to a broken toe last season, hindered the switch-
hitting Tobias from contributing on a consistent basis. Tobias increased his power at the plate by revamping his swing and adding muscle to his frame.
He was bench-pressing 140-pound dumbbells during a 
team workout on Wednesday. The grind hasn’t gone unno-ticed. 
“He’s always been really strong,” Gushue said, chuck-
ling. “I don’t know. When we get in the weight room he just becomes a different animal. He just gets after it. He’s really 
strong. I know over break he put in a lot of good work. It has 
really shown now.”bASe , from page 13Frazier struggles early in game, finishes 3 of 9 for nine points
open shots to end the first half. 
But with just more than 10 min-
utes remaining in the second half, 
the sophomore guard connected from three to put Florida ahead 47-34, which was its biggest lead of the night.
Frazier hit his next two to finish 
the game 3 of 9 for nine points.In a defen-
sive struggle on Thursday, the Gators only had two players, Casey Prather and Patric Young, score more than Frazier and have 
double-digit scoring performances. For the first time since defeating Fresno State 66-49 on Dec. 21, Flor-ida had only two players score 10 or more points in a game.
Prather and Young each were 
held to two field goals and nine combined points in the first half, but the seniors broke loose after the break to give the Gators their first back-to-back victories in Starkville in more than 10 years.
Prather shot 5 of 6 to end the 
game and finished with a game-high 16 points along with seven re-bounds.
“You’ve got to be strong with 
the basketball,” Prather said. “We’re on the road so we might not get as many shots as we want to. So we had to be strong with the basketball going to the rim.”
Young, who was 2-of-4 shoot-
ing for four points and had two re-bounds in the first half, also found his rhythm after the break. The se-nior center finished the night second on the squad with 12 points and eight boards.
“We had no post presence to 
close out the half,” Donovan said. “We didn’t handle the end of the half very well. And then (Young) made a couple plays and he really got into the flow of the game when we found him. He did some good things.”

The last time Florida visited 
the Randal Tyson Track Center in 
Fayetteville, Ark., was during the 
2013 Southeastern Conference In-
door Championships. 
The men’s team fell runner-up 
to the defending champions Ar-
kansas.
No. 2 Florida will look to 
avenge that defeat against top-
ranked Arkansas today.
Multiple athletes will make 
their debut for the spring season in the tightly contested meet, in-cluding UF long jump record-holder Marquis Dendy. 
Coach Mike Holloway said he 
is looking forward to his defend-ing national champion opening up this weekend. 
Dendy took the crown in last 
spring’s Southeastern Conference Championships in the long jump with a mark of 8.25 meters, and he also ﬁ  nished third in the triple 
jump at 16.25 meters. 
Dendy believes most athletes 
lack the ability to perform well in 
both the long and triple jump. 
Dendy said the main chal-
lenge is changing from long to triple jump. He said most people are only really good at one, but not both. 
But he believes he is well-bal-
anced. 
The junior jumper is also 
aware of how to adapt his mental approach to both events.
“Long jump I’m thinking ag-
gressive, ﬁ  erce you know I got to come down there running angry, 
wild, barracuda-style,” Dendy 
said. 
“Triple jump, I’ve got to think more like elegant. 
I’ve got to come down there 
swiftly, smooth, slower so it’s hard when I have violence on the other side, and being kind on the 
other.”

No. 2 Florida and No. 19 
Baylor will meet on Saturday 
in similar situations. 
Both teams are ranked, 
both are ﬁ  rst in their confer-ence standings and both are coming off a streak of three 
consecutive shutout wins.
The Gators (3-0) will try to 
keep their streak alive when 
they travel to Waco, Texas, to play the Bears (6-0) on Satur-
day. 
The Gators will face a long 
stretch of challenging oppo-
nents in the upcoming weeks, including a series of matches 
against ranked teams at the 
National Team Indoors on 
Feb. 7-10. 
Baylor marks the be-
ginning of Florida’s tough 
stretch and will present the 
stiffest competition UF has 
encountered all season. 
“Baylor is very tough,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist 
said. “They’re a scrappy 
team. They’re going to give 
us problems; [they] play long games, get a lot of balls back, and … it’s going to be a big crowd.”
Crowd noise is expected 
to play a large part in the out-come of the Gators’ ﬁ  rst road game of the season.
“Last time we played there — about two years ago — they had about [600] or 700 people outdoors, so if they’re bringing 500 indoors its going to be really loud,” 
Thornqvist said.
The Gators will play in-
doors for their second consec-
utive game after frigid tem-peratures forced the match 
against UCF to be moved in-
side the Perry Indoor Tennis 
Facility. Florida hopes that 
playing its last match indoors will help them adjust quickly 
against Baylor.
“It’s a little faster [in-
doors],” senior Olivia Janow-
icz said. 
“The ball’s not moving as 
much. We’ve been practic-
ing here quite a bit lately … 
We’re comfortable with it.” 
Florida’s seniors are accus-
tomed to playing in hostile 
road environments, but UF’s 
three freshmen will experi-
ence their ﬁ  rst away game in a loud environment. 
“There are some things 
we have to handle other than 
forehands and backhands 
this weekend,” Thornqvist said. “For [the freshmen], it’s going to be their ﬁ  rst [road 
game].
“I’m hoping if we can 
handle that, [then] I feel very 
conﬁ  dent about our tennis 
right now.” 16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 31, 2014
