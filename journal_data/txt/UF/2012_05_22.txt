UF’s Board of Trustees has approved a $2 per credit hour in-
crease to the Capital Improvement Trust Fund fee that will help 
fund renovations to the Reitz Union.
In March, the board approved the $50 million expansion 
of the student union, to be ﬁ  nanced through bonds, and a $25 million renovation, $20 mil-
lion of which would be funded by the Capital Improvement Trust Fund.
Although the fund was initially expected 
to yield $20 million, the Board of Governors recently let UF know the available amount in the fund was only $4.9 million.
To make up the difference, trustees voted 
Monday to adjust the CITF fee by $2, increas-
ing the fee from $4.76 to $6.76 per credit hour. This is the ﬁ  rst time the fee has been adjusted in 30 years.
Student Body President Tj Villamil said the 5,000 signatures 
of support for the proposed expansion from students, as well as the support of about 60 student organizations that use the Reitz Union, show the project is a high priority.
“This is something that students really did want, and it’s got Trustees approve  
increasing fee for Reitz Union renovations

A UF student died Monday morning of unknown causes.
Stephen C. Speck’s roommate tried to wake him in their 
dorm room at Rawlings Hall and performed CPR when he saw Speck, 19, in distress.
University Police and emergency medical services were no-tiﬁ  ed at 8:46 a.m. They arrived three minutes later.
EMS also performed CPR on Speck before they took him to 
Shands at UF. He died at 9:26 a.m.
“We are treating this incident, as any unattended death, as a 
death investigation,” UPD spokesman Brad Barber said. “But at this point we do not have any indication that this was any-thing other than a medical-related incident.”
His friends view his death as a tragedy. They showed their love on his Facebook wall Monday.
An Oviedo resident, Speck was chosen to play clarinet in 
the 2006-2007 Seminole All-County Band.
He continued to play in high school.Speck became an Eagle Scout on June 14, 2009 with Troop 
No. 613, according to a newsletter from the Central Florida 
Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

Mafia-style end for Australia’s 
flawed Obama mugs
CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — 
Australian officials wanted to get 
rid of some commemorative mugs that misspelled President Barack Obama’s name. And boy, did they 
ever.
A Parliament House official told 
senators on Monday that 198 mugs 
were smashed and buried under wet concrete at a loading dock behind the building. Sen. John Faulkner called it a “mafia-style ex-ecution” for the mugs, which had an extra “r’’ printed in Obama’s 
first name.
The government made 200 of 
the mugs to commemorate the 
president’s planned visit to Aus-tralia in 2010, which was later can-celed. No mugs were created when the American president finally made it to Australia last year.
Only two of the mugs were ever 
sold from the Parliament House gift shop, including one to the jour -
nalist who reported that Obama’s name had been misspelled.
“Due to the sensitivity associat-
ed with the mistake that was made with the president’s name, the last thing we wanted was for the frag-ments to be found on a garbage 
tip somewhere,” said Bronwyn 
Graham, the Parliament House of-ficial.
“I am not saying it was a bad 
idea. It is creative; I will give you that,” Faulkner told Graham and her superior, David Kenny, who had authorized the disposal.
“You have not buried any other 
mistakes in concrete, have you Mr. Kenny , per chance?” Faulkner asked. Kenny said he had not.

Tons of pot found floating off 
Southern Calif.
DANA POINT, Calif. (AP) — 
Authorities say three and a half 
tons of marijuana have been found floating in the ocean off Southern California.
A boater spotted 160 bales of 
pot around noon Sunday about 15 miles off the coast of Dana Point. Orange County authorities and the Coast Guard sent boats to gather up the pot and turn it over to the U.S. Border Patrol.
They say it’s unclear who 
dumped the pot, which together have just moved Gonzalez to the back of the room. Bonner encour -

Coffee shop owner Jason Wil-

Ouch! Dog bites politician, but

FRANKENMUTH TOWN-

Ann Doyle can put a campaign sign on his property.
Doyle says she didn’t see the

says the owner heard the com-
motion and called off the ani-mal.
Doyle says she was bleed-

to be done right,” Villamil said.
He noted that raising the CITF fee is 
in keeping with the board’s promise to 
not create new fees to fund renovations to the Reitz Union.
Graduate assistants and graduate 
students with associate appointments will not have to pay the fee.  
Money from the CITF fee is collect-
ed from state universities and released by the Board of Governors every three to five years, depending on the needs of the universities.
Kratzer said he was surprised the trust fund fell so short this cycle.
“All along when I proposed this, I 
didn’t think we’d have to do this,” he said.
UF needs the full $20 million to be 
able to complete the renovations all at once. Although projects on campus are usually completed in multiple phases, he said, it would be more efficient to finish the project in one phase because the building is used year-round for a variety of purposes, unlike most class-room buildings.
Otherwise, he said, “You’re actually 
paying for that twice.”

“The cool thing about his show 
in Gainesville is that the audience 
will get a sneak peek of the tap-
ing of his new Comedy Central special,” said Debbie Keller, Dun-ham’s publicist.
He also recently appeared on 
the Forbes 100 Most Powerful Ce-lebrities list.
Dunham is renting out the fa-
cilities, said Matt Cox, operations director of UF Performing Arts. The performance is not affiliated with any UF group.
Puppets appearing with Dun-
ham will include Walter the grumpy retiree; Achmed the dead terrorist; Achmed Junior; the beer-fueled Bubba J; the manic purple Peanut and Peanut’s own ventriloquist dummy, according to the press release.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 22, 2012

Jeff Dunham performing at Phillips Center � THE PROPOSED CUTS TO-
TAL $13.4 MILLION. 
CLARE LENNON
Alligator Staff Writer
UF administrators say budget 
cuts are inevitable, including the 
$13.4 million that might come 
from their own budget.
The budget cuts proposed for 
the administration would reduce 
state funding put toward areas 
such as Student Health Care Cen-ter services, the UF International 
Center, research and university li-braries. Some of these cuts would result in reduced positions and 
services.
The cuts, which were pro-
posed Friday, came after the 
Florida Legislature required UF to  reduce its budget for the up-
coming fiscal year by about $38 
million.
The fiscal year begins July 1, 
and UF President Bernie Machen 
will present a final budget pro-
posal to members of UF’s Board of Trustees during its meeting scheduled for June 7 and June 8.
Members of Faculty Senate 
will discuss the overall budget Tuesday.
Scott Nygren, chairman of 
Faculty Senate, encourages any-one with suggestions or ques-tions about the proposed budgets 
to bring them forward in time for 
the meeting next week. 
The Faculty Senate’s discus-
sion website allows users to com-ment on issues such as the bud-
get.
Nygren said the administra-
tive budget seemed appropriate, 
and it lined up with other cuts UF 
will have to make. 
Current proposals protect 
tenure-track and tenured faculty 
from layoffs, but other faculty and staff positions might be elim-inated.
“That’s not a good idea, but 
it’s still something that may be necessary,” Nygren said.
Provost Joe Glover said meet-
ing the legislature’s requirement 
is not an option, and all the pro-
posed budgets are acceptable.
“People may come up with 
even better ideas,” he said, “but 
the ones that have been proposed 
are reasonable.”

A nationwide search for the new vice presi-
dent of student affairs ended where it began.
Dave Kratzer, who has served as the interim 
vice president for student affairs since April 1, 
2011, was officially named to the position Fri-
day.
“I am deeply honored to be given this op-
portunity,” Kratzer said. “I think it’s important 
— and our staff will remember every day — that student affairs begins with students.”
Kratzer took over the interim position after 
Patricia Telles-Irvin left UF last year to become the vice president for student affairs at North-western University.
In 1986, Kratzer joined UF as the director of 
the Reitz Union, according to his website. He served as the associate vice president for stu-dent affairs from 2005 to 2011.
Kratzer has advocated for campus projects 
that improve student welfare, including the ex-pansion and renovation of the Reitz Union and 
the implementation of the “U Matter, We Care” campaign, which seeks to help students and faculty members in dis-tress.
Student Body President 
Tj Villamil said Student 
Government is extremely pleased with the selection and believes Kratzer will 
continue to work well with the Student Body.
“It’s a great success for the students,” Vil-
lamil said.

CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
The Student Senate will vote 
on a bill today that could limit 
when students can campaign for Student Government.
Proposed revisions would 
add “campaign activity” as in-tentional action supporting or opposing a candidate or party.
Campaign activity would be 
allowed to start four weeks be-
fore the election and end when 
the polls close. However, the 
activity could not refer to a spe-
cific election.
This would be a change from 
the UF Supreme Court’s spring 
ruling that campaign-like activ-
ity could occur any time.
The revisions would also 
redefine “campaigning” to en-compass election-specific ma-
terials such as encouraging stu-
dents to vote on a certain issue.Campaigning would begin 
one week before the first day of elections and end when the polls close.
But the revisions say a 
website with general informa-tion about the party and party 
members would not be cam-
paigning. The revisions also 
propose adding Internet posts 
as campaign material.
The Judiciary Committee 
approved the proposal to go before the Senate.
Committee member Sen. 
Cory Yeffet was in favor of the 
revisions.
“What I see from this piece 
of code revision is pretty much 
fair on all grounds,” he said.
However, another member 
of the committee, Sen. Umair Asghar, said limiting campaign 
activity to a few weeks out of 
the year violates state law.
“I think there should be a lot 
more time put into this other 
than the one week,“ he said.

Nearly 40 percent of col-
lege students at four-year 
U.S. institutions could be 
deemed alcoholics next year, 
according to the label in the newest edition of the Diag-nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
The current edition of the 
manual labels alcohol issues as either alcohol abuse, clas-sified as a short-term prob-
lem, or alcohol dependence, 
a chronic problem popularly recognized as alcoholism. 
But the proposed changes 
in the newest edition of the manual, which will be pub-lished in May 2013 following final revisions, would only include one diagnosis: sub-
stance use disorder. Patients 
would be measured as mild, moderate or severe cases, depending on the number of harmful criteria they meet based on their history of ac-tions involving alcohol, not the quantity or frequency of their drinking.
Assistant professor Dan-
iel Logan of the UF Depart-ment of Psychiatry said di-agnosing college students under the new system would be difficult because of the short amount of time most students have been drink-ing. The lack of opportuni-ties students have to evalu-ate the consequences of their drinking makes it harder to 
justify diagnosing them as 
being alcohol-dependent.
“Once you’re an alcohol-
ic, you don’t go to not being an alcoholic anymore,” he said. “We don’t want to give people labels or stigmatize them with something that’s transient.”
Kevin Dotson, a 23-year-
old Santa Fe College student 
who says his father is a func-
tioning alcoholic, agreed.
For as long as Dotson can 
remember, his father drinks every night after work. Sometimes he only drinks one cocktail, Dotson said, but sometimes he mixes al-cohol with sleeping pills.
“I wouldn’t want any col-
lege kid to relate to what my dad does,” he said. “They’re just doing it for fun and be-ing social.”
Logan said the classifica-
tions could encourage denial 
and functional alcoholism.
“People think,‘I’m not 
that bad, I’m not as bad as 
they are. I can’t have a prob-lem’,” he said. “It will have a bad outcome for our pa-tients.”
May 21, 1969: A man was severely gored by a 
1,000-pound Brahma bull at the Gainesville Live-
stock Market after smashing down the wooden par -
tition of a cattle truck. The victim, 46-year-old Mat-thew B. Sanchez, was rushed to Alachua General 
Hospital where he underwent surgery for wounds 
to his stomach and hip. “It was a wild bull,” said L.H. Thompson of the Gainesville Livestock Market. “This was probably the first time he had ever been penned up - and he didn’t like it one bit.”
May 24, 1983: Henry Badcock, owner of Bad-
cock’s Furniture in downtown Gainesville, falsely reported a robbery and hostage situation at his store. After police cleared the store and found no one in-
side, Badcock was taken in for questioning and ad-
mitted to Alachua General Hospital for psychiatric evaluation.
May 20, 1988: The inventor of the Nautilus exer -
cise system, Arthur A. Jones, announced a donation of $8.47 million to UF, the largest donation ever made to a Florida public university. Jones said the money would go to UF’s Center for Exercise Science and the Health Science Center over a 10-year period. 
May 25, 1989: Florida Blue Key, a prestigious stu-
dent honor society at UF, was placed on six months of probation for misconduct at a party held the previous month at the Florida Museum of Natural History. Student Services Dean Jim Scott gave the punishment after an investigation by the conduct committee found the group guilty of damaging cam-pus property and sponsoring an event involving al-
cohol.
May 22, 1990: The NCAA sendt an inquiry letter 
asking UF to defend itself against 10 alleged viola-
tions, ranging from accusations of sports agents pay-
ing players to coaches acting unethically . UF officials expected the letter, according to UF President John Lombardi. Lombardi said the letter focuses on sev-eral perceived problems that UF has already been trying to resolve.

SG election codes 
limit free speech
At the end of the spring semester, we wrote a series of 
editorials addressing UF Student Government election 
codes and their negative implications for student free 
speech.
First, we discussed the issue with code 762.0, which requires 
that candidates and parties attach “Registered Political Adver -
tisement” to all campaign materials. Due to a vague definition of campaign material, this code could be enforced against almost 
anything someone says in favor of or against a particular candi-
date or party.
Next, we questioned code 761.1, which appeared to constrain 
“any intentional action in support of, or in opposition to, a can-
didate or political party for an elective student body office” to a 
four-week period.
Both of these codes provide ample opportunity for the party 
in power to limit student free speech, especially for those stu-dents who have aspirations to run for office.
At the end of last semester, the UF Supreme Court recom-
mended that SG amend the rules to clarify the meaning of “cam-
paigning” and determine when these activities could occur.
We were hopeful that the Student Senate would revise the 
rules to remove these vague and draconian limitations on free 
speech. Instead, this evening the Student Senate will be voting 
on whether to add even stricter rules to candidates, political par -
ties and, perhaps, even the general student body.
First, the proposed code revisions now clearly stipulate that 
campaign activities can only occur on the first day of the active 
election cycle, or four weeks before election day. Election-specif-
ic material, such as things that say “vote for,” cannot occur until 
one week prior to the first day of elections.
They also added “Internet posts” to its definition of cam-
paign material, which now extends the ability of the Elections Commission to give violations to online communications that 
do not have “Reg. Pol. Ad.”
Because the codes surrounding this requirement are so vague, 
an election-related post by a student who is not running for of-fice that does not bear “Reg. Pol. Ad.” could potentially lead to 
an election code violation for the candidate or party that was 
mentioned by the student.
These code revisions clearly violate student free speech and 
deserve serious scrutiny from the entire student body.
While this might not seem like a big deal to some, if you do 
support someone running for office in SG in the future, simply saying something in support of him or her at the wrong time or without adding “Reg. Pol. Ad.” could cost the election.
The Senate should, without question, vote against these elec-
tion code revisions. We strongly encourage you to contact your 
senator to tell him or her to vote against these revisions.
We also encourage you to attend this meeting. It will be held 
at 7 p.m. tonight in Reitz Union 282.Welcome to the Web, a voyeur’s paradise
I’m not really liking the turn technology has taken 
lately.
It has become creepy and invasive, but somehow 
society is OK with that.
Some of the newer features of Facebook are social 
readers that show up on our news feeds. They inform us of what news article our friends are reading on particu-
lar websites. I’d be embarrassed if my friends had to see 
how many articles I read about the Kardashian sisters — unlike some of my friends, apparently — so I don’t use social readers very much.
Neither does anyone else these days. At its peak, the 
Washington Post Social Reader reached about 18 million monthly active users. As of the first week of May, the tool had about 9 million monthly active users. Oops?

aren’t doing so well, either; the Guardian had about 600,000 daily active users in the beginning of April and fewer than 100,000 daily active users in the beginning of May.
People aren’t so excited about having every detail of 
their Internet lives broadcasted to all of their friends. But the point of social networking sites is to connect, or re-connect, via common interests, right? There just has to be a limit to what we share with certain people.
Which brings me to Google’s latest ad campaign.Google has released some pretty powerful commer -
cials in recent years; its “It Gets Better” ad for Google Chrome is more than a year old and was created with the Google Creative Lab’s newest theme, “The web is what 
you make of it.”
Like any campaign, the creative videos were designed 
to sell us something — or to sell us on the idea of some-
thing.
Eventually those videos turned into the “Search Sto-
ries” series. One of these, titled “Parisian Love,” pre-miered during the 2010 Super Bowl. It follows a fictional love story between some face-less dude and his French girl-friend; the story evolves and 
ends with the guy searching for 
directions on how to assemble a crib.
First of all, cribs come with 
assembly directions. Second, the ad was made without any clear 
definition of how time was passing, so I have no idea how soon into this relationship he was thinking about having kids. Whatever, I can put my jaded soul aside for 
a bit and appreciate this guy’s journey to find love.
Fine.
But now Google has released something even worse.Let me introduce you to Mark Potter.
Potter is certainly trying to make the most out of 
his web experience by attempting to win over his ex-
girlfriend with a Da Vinci Code-esque Google doc of shame.
The ad seems to be a wild plea to fix a relationship 
gone awry; it’s not exactly clear if the couple split or if they’ve just had a fight. Either way, as the “Jen” in this video, are we supposed to feel flattered that he went to so much work to win us over or do we need to reiterate 
the “no means no” lesson?
Because so much of our lives is kept on the web 
“cloud,” Potter is able to pull up an awful lot of old 
memories of their relationship and put them on display. It’s some sort of weird grand gesture; are shame docs the 
new mixtapes?
Good luck, Mark Potter.
Your crazed mission to win Jen back is only fueled by 
how much of our lives is already virtually scrapbooked, 
which does a lot of the work for you.

New York City used to be the city of hopes and dreams. 
Today, we see a different narrative emerging.
Last week, New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg showed his true colors as being part of the 1 per-cent. Bloomberg, the 20th richest man in the world, is loudly 
denouncing the so-called living wage bill that has just passed 
New York Council.
The bill would require publicly subsidized companies to 
raise the minimum wage for workers to $10 with beneﬁ  ts or $11.50 without them. While many employees would gladly welcome this bill, the New York mayor seems to see his be-loved town turning a bright shade of Communist red.
Bloomberg elaborated his “let them eat cake” stance on the 
living wage bill on a local radio show when he said, “The last 
time we really had a big managed economy was the USSR, and 
that didn’t work out so well.”
 This hyperbolic quote is an example of how conservatives 
react when faced with most social services — they automati-cally see “red” and cry Stalin.
Fortunately, he’s alone in his modern anti-communism cru-
sade (unless you count the “brave” ﬁ  ve out of 44 council mem-bers who voted against the bill). Bloomberg’s stance shows how disconnected he is from the people of New York. He would rather favor businesses than reg-ular working-class people.
For instance, the company 
FreshDirect (a grocery delivery service based out of New York) 
has reported receiving $129 mil-
lion directly from taxpayers’ pockets, yet the company is cur-rently paying its workers less than $9 an hour.
Bloomberg willingly hands out taxpayer money to this 
company, which offers a service only the wealthy can afford, while refusing to support a bill that would improve the lives of many New York workers.
In a city like New York, a $10 per hour wage is coveted by 
the working class. If you were to drive past Yankee Stadium on game days, you would see a line of cashiers forming outside the perimeter. 
Yankee Stadium hires more cashiers than necessary and has 
them wait for hours on a ﬁ  rst come, ﬁ  rst served system to get to work that day. The unlucky ones have just wasted unpaid time standing in the heat. The hope of receiving a higher wage in a city with such a high cost of living was reason enough to wait.However, Bloomberg’s reaction to this bill is symptomatic 
of larger societal issues. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg, worth $19 billion, has been reportedly trying to avoid his taxes while the rest of us work hours upon hours just to make ends meet. While we crawl through this fun game called life, these billion-
aires play hide-and-seek with their money.
Bloomberg’s attitude toward the living wage bill is a re-
minder that the ones who toil every day don’t matter to the 
wealthy. Government policy, as seen with FreshDirect, concen-trates on afﬂ  uent corporations and ensures its prosperity. Yet the citizens who pay the taxes to subsidize these companies are relinquished to the shadows.
If the citizens raise their voices and state that these policies 
are unfair, billionaires like Bloomberg call them communists.
I ask you to not take the title seriously.Fighting for one’s rights and striving for a fair society is the 
honorable path to take. As Bloomberg brushes up on his Mc-Carthyism, citizens and workers need to realize that it’s not wrong to strive for equality.
Remember that people were born with a heartbeat, not the 
corporations.

On May 20, 1865, U.S. General Edward 
M. McCook gave the ﬁ  rst reading of the Emancipation Proclamation 
in the state of Florida. During the Civil War, more than 1,000 African-American 
Floridians joined nearly a quarter of a mil-
lion African-Americans across the nation to serve in the Union Army and Navy. Many more worked as scouts, spies and laborers in a struggle to end the long nightmare of slavery. Henceforth, African-American Flo-ridians observed May 20 as a sacred day of remembrance of the Peculiar Institution’s many victims, and in hope that the nation 
would nevermore place property rights 
above human rights.
African-Americans understood that slav-
ery continued to exist in our hemisphere. In the decades after May 20, African-American churches and conventions organized to pro-test slavery in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Cuba. One mass meeting, chaired by the great abolitionist  the Rev. Henry 
Highland Garnet at Mother Bethel A.M.E. 
Church in Philadelphia, led to the formation of the American Foreign Anti-Slavery Soci-ety in 1840.
Garnet pledged his organization’s sup-
port to the anti-colonial struggle being waged in Cuba and stated, “If the veteran abolition-ists of the United States had not mustered themselves out of service, I believe that there would not now have been a single slave in the island of Cuba. We sympathize with the 
patriots of Cuba, not simply because they are 
republicans, but because their triumph will be the destruction of slavery in that land. All of Europe now frowns upon Spain because of her attitude toward human bondage. We must take our place on the broad platform of human rights, and plead for the brother-hood of the entire human race.”
Tragically, the Rev. Garnet’s call for the 
recognition of universal human rights fell upon deaf ears in his own country. As one-party rule swept the South, forced labor re-emerged. Convicts, primarily African-American men, were traded as commodities to farmers and corporations to work in the coal mines of Birmingham, Ala., the cotton ﬁ  elds of Georgia and the turpentine camps of Florida. Municipalities viewed the con-
viction of African-Americans as a source 
of revenue. J.C. Powell, a white prison cap-tain, dubbed Florida “The American gulag” and PBS’s recent documentary “Slavery by Another Name” reveals that millions of African-American men were held in chattel bondage long after the end of the Civil War.
C o u r a g e o u s 
voices spoke against 
the insidious new slavery. Foremost among these was Florida’s Stetson Kennedy. In 1952, Kennedy risked life and limb to gather testi-mony about slavery in the South, present-ing this evidence before the United Nations Commission on Forced Labor in Geneva.
Modern-day slavery continues to exist in 
Florida. Barry Estabrook notes in his recently published book “Tomatoland” that, “In the 
last ﬁ  fteen years, Florida law enforcement 
ofﬁ  cials have freed more than one thousand men and women who have been held and forced to work against their will in the ﬁ  elds of Florida, and that represents only the tip of the iceberg. Most instances of slavery go unreported.”
There is a solution to these egregious 
violations of human rights in our state. A 
Florida-based organization, the Coalition 
of Immokalee Workers, recently earned the Anti-Slavery Award from Anti-Slavery In-ternational in London for its efforts to expose and to end slavery in Florida agriculture. Major corporations, including Taco Bell, Mc-Donald’s and Trader Joe’s, have joined the CIW’s Campaign for Fair Food, which has led to the ﬁ  rst enforceable code of conduct joining consumers, growers and purchasers of Florida produce together to ensure that 
agricultural workers are treated fairly and 
paid regularly for their labor.
Unfortunately, a major purchaser of Flor-
ida tomatoes, Publix Super Markets, contin-ues to ignore the pleas of religious leaders and Florida consumers to join the growing list of ﬁ  rms that have pledged to abolish exploitation and slavery in our ﬁ  elds. By claiming that it bears no responsibility for 
the conditions of the men and women who 
pick the crops that help generate enormous proﬁ  ts, Publix ignores the wishes of its cus-tomers who have been petitioning the com-pany for more than two years.
On this newest Emancipation Day, we 
should pledge to take up Garnet’s call to ﬁ  ght for universal human rights and for the brotherhood of the entire human race re-
gardless of occupation, racial background or 
nationality. It is up to us to honor the spirit of May 20 in Florida.

A Gainesville man is accused of beating, 
strangling and kidnapping his girlfriend before 
stealing her car Wednesday.
Samuel Tobias Jemel Anderson, 22, is 
charged with grand theft, false imprisonment, prevention of communication with police and two counts of domestic battery.
Police gave the following report:About 6 p.m. Tuesday, Anderson got angry 
with his girlfriend, Tiffany Jackson, because she talked with friends outside. He started to punch her in the head.
The fight moved from the living room to the 
kitchen.
In the kitchen, Anderson told Jackson he 
would kill her if she told anyone about the 
beating.
Then he grabbed her throat and began to 
squeeze.
She fell down, unconscious.
When she woke up, she said she wanted to 
leave, according to the report.
Anderson forced her into a room and stood 
by the door to make sure she didn’t.
Jackson woke up Wednesday morning and 
used Anderson’s cellphone to call her mother for help.When Anderson woke up and heard her on 
his phone saying she was calling the police, he took the phone.
Jackson ran into the bathroom and locked 
the door because she was afraid of another beating, according to the report.
Anderson split the door frame as he kicked 
the door in.
He grabbed her hair and started punching 
her right eye.
After beating her until her 
eye swelled, Anderson put her in another room and guarded 
the door.
When Anderson went to 
the bathroom, Jackson made her escape to neighbor Artina Williams’ apartment.
Anderson banged on Wil-
liams’ door and demanded that she unlock it and that Jackson come outside.
When Jackson didn’t come out, Anderson 
went back to their apartment, took her car keys and drove away with her car.
Anderson was arrested at 2:30 p.m. on 
Wednesday.
He is currently in jail and his bond is set at 
$85,000.

Courtney Tomlinson said she 
thought she’d live forever as she 
sat outside a downtown Gainesville Starbucks sipping on her venti Caffè Mocha.
Earlier that day, she’d seen an ar -ticle about a study that linked drink-ing coffee to living longer.
“I’ve been drinking coffee since 
high school, which is probably like 
10 years,” said Tomlinson, a 30-year-
old elementary education junior at Santa Fe College. “I guess I’m going to live forever.”
The study , published online last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, examined about 400,000 people 50 to 71 years old.
Its head researcher, Neal Freed-man, said it is the largest study of coffee on long-term health.
Due to the many components 
in coffee, Freedman said, the study shouldn’t be taken at face value.
Tina Adkins is the general man-
ager at Sweetwater Organic Coffee 
Roasters, which provides organic 
coffee roasted locally to places like Pascal’s Coffee, Satchel’s Pizza and UF’s Gator Dining Services.
She said she sees the benefits of 
coffee herself.
“Do I drink coffee? Yes,” she said. 
“Probably from the time I get up un-til the time I actually leave work. I 
mean, we drink a lot of coffee — a 
lot of coffee.” Study finds frequent coffee drinking linked to living longer

Gainesville residents might soon be able to 
buy food from their favorite mobile vendors by the light of day.
The Gainesville City Commission prelimi-
narily voted 5-0 last week to change a city law 
that would extend operating hours for vend-ing and mobile food vendors in downtown Gainesville from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Food ven-dors in the Midtown area of Gainesville would also have their hours extended.
According to the ordinancew, food ven-
dors would be able to serve customers from  7 a.m. to 3 a.m. seven days a week. Additional approval would finalize the new hours.
Jeff Babik, who worked with the Public 
Safety Committee on the issue, wrote a pro-posal last fall that promoted extending hours as a way for the vendors to generate revenue.
“It is often easy for us to see food vendors 
at face value and not realize that a lot of the vendors are out there to make a living and 
bring in some much-needed income for their 
family and to support themselves,” he wrote.City Commission initially approves extended food vendor hoursAnderson

The Gators only needed three goals 
to reach the Final Four. They scored 
15.
No. 1 seed Florida (19-2) made his-
tory by coming out of the NCAA wom-en’s quarterfinals with a 15-2 blowout win against Penn State (12-7) to earn 
their first-ever Final Four appearance.
In just a matter of three seasons, the 
Gators have accomplished a lot by tak-
ing past mistakes and learning from them.
“This was a monumental win for 
us,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “We have been preparing for this since we lost to Duke in the same round last 
year. These young ladies have put in so 
much hard work. They have the heart, they have the passion and I thought it really showed today.”
In addition to earning its first Final 
Four appearance in the NCAA Tourna-ment, the Gators became the youngest team to earn two tournament wins and advance to the national semifinals as 
well as becoming the second program 
in the 30-year history of women’s la-crosse to advance to the Final Four in only its third season.
“I think the little things are the most 
important things in the game,” junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell said. “Like ground balls, draw controls, I think those are key in every game be-
cause whoever has possession is the 
team that’s going to score the goals.”
These key factors certainly gave the 
Gators the advantage Saturday. 
Dashiell led the team with three 
goals and two assists. Freshman Nora Barry also contributed with three goals of her own, while freshman Shannon 
Gilroy and juniors Ashley Bruns and 
Kitty Cullen each put up two goals and an assist. 
Freshman attacker Taylor McCord 
made her mark as well by scoring the final goal of the game in her first career postseason appearance.

For the third straight year, the Gators 
are one win away from a national title.
No. 2 Florida (26-1) advanced to 
the NCAA Tournament final after de-
feating No. 3 Duke (29-3) in the closest match the Gators have played this post-season. 
The match remained close to the fi-
nal point, with Alexandra Cercone put-ting UF on top with a 4-3 victory.
“I don’t know how we won that 
match,” said coach Roland Thornqvist.
The match began with a close con-
test for the doubles point. The Gators and the Blue Devils split the first two matches, but Florida’s No. 1 duo of Lauren Embree and Joanna Mather won the point with a 9-8 victory.
The match moved to singles, and 
Duke quickly regained momentum, 
despite losing the doubles point.
The Blue Dev-
ils won the first set 
on five of the six 
courts, with Em-
bree providing the only first-set victory 
for the Gators.
“The first hour in singles, they were 
beating us to death,” Thornqvist said.

trailing in their matches, Embree de-feated Ester Goldfeld in straight sets Gators to play in third

Although softball should have been the 
only thing on the Gators’ minds this past 
weekend, it wasn’t.
Instead, Florida also dealt with the dis-
missal of three student-athletes, which was announced just before the start of Friday’s matchup with Florida Gulf Coast.
Sami Fagan, Kasey Fagan and Cheyenne 
Coyle did not suit up to face the Eagles in the Gators’ first NCAA Regional game of the weekend, and FGCU took advantage of UF’s shorthanded roster for its first ever NCAA Tournament victory. 
Although coach Tim Walton said there 
was no doubt the decision to move on with-out the players was a distraction to the squad, he said the team’s struggles were not caused by the dismissals. 
“I don’t think it’s about three people,” he 
said. “I think it’s about where we were at as a team and how we did offensively and what we can do to get that clutch hit. That’s been the M.O. of our team all year long, finding 
a way to get the clutch hit. To be honest with you, that 
stuff right there was hap-pening all season.”
FGCU’s David Deiros 
believed otherwise.
“I think they missed 
having Sami Fagan in the lineup to disrupt some 
things,” Deiros said. “I think offensively it may have made a difference.”
Sami Fagan, the team’s only slap hitter, 
led the team in batting average (.378) and Player dismissals prove costly

“(Friday) was a hard day 
for all of us,” Lauren Hae-ger said after Saturday’s two victories.
Florida’s challenges 
would only get more diffi-cult against South Florida in Sunday’s NCAA Regional Championship game.
The Gators were shut out 
for just the fifth time all year and desperately could have used a deeper bench in the drawn-out pitching duel with the Bulls.
With the game ending in 
a 1-0 loss, Florida needed some kind of offensive out-put, which it could have gotten from the team’s third leading home run hitter (10) and RBI provider (34) in Coyle.
But even with the Gators’ 
earliest exit since 2006, Wal-ton stuck by his decision and even had support from USF’s Ken Erikson who en-dured a similar situation in 2008 when he had to sus-pend 13 players for break-ing curfew right before the start of the regular season.
“It’s very tough. People 
are involved,” Eriksen said. “We try to do the right thing. We’re teachers at heart, coaches secondarily. You have to make the deci-sions long term that are go-ing to benefit your team and also your university. You do what’s right.”
And although doing what was right in Walton’s eyes may have cost him a shot at a fifth straight Wom-en’s College World Series berth and second consecu -
tive championship series appearance, Walton said at least the hardship served as a learning experience for his players and coaches.
“I think it’s a lesson for 
everybody,” Walton said. “It’s a lesson for me as a par -
ent. It’s a lesson for me as a coach. It’s a lesson for the players and the staff.“I just try to do the best 
job I can possibly do and gather everything I can do as a leader. The game — what you do and how you compete — is a life’s lesson 
for everybody.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MAY 22, 2012

For the second consecutive 
year, the women’s golf team will 
make an appearance at the NCAA 
Championships today. For Evan 
Jensen, this will also be her last. 
The senior, who has shot an 
average of 74.43 for the 2011-12 
season, will lead the team as they 
search for their third NCAA title in program history.
Their first two wins came in 
back-to-back years in 1985 and 
1986. 
“It’s definitely something I’ve 
thought about being my last col-
lege tournament,” Jensen said. 
“It’s difficult to leave here, I don’t really want to. I’ve loved every 
moment here, so going into this last tournament is going to be great.” 
Despite the bittersweet atmo-
sphere, Jensen is coming off one of her best performances this year, which led the Gators to place tied for fourth at the NCAA 
East Regional. Jensen shot a three 
day total of 217 (+1) carding nine birdies against eight bogeys to secure a tie for seventh. 
“I played really well, and I 
did leave a few shots out there, but that’s always a good feeling knowing that I was so close to winning a tournament in a really 
good field,” Jensen said.
“It’s a good feeling knowing that I have the ability (to win), 
and I’ve already competed with these players.”
The field for the NCAA Cham-
pionships will consist of 18 teams 
ranked in the top 25, including 
Florida at No. 
12. But coach 
Jan Dowling still believes her team will come 
out on top.
“Our  ulti-
mate goal would 
be to win, we would love to do 
that and I think we’re capable of 
it,” Dowling said. “I know the 
team is hungry to get back in the mix. That’s all you can ask for when you’re playing in a college golf tournament or any golf tour -
nament is to get yourself into the 
mix and get yourself in conten-
tion.”
The Gators have stayed in the 
mix for a majority of the season with six top-five finishes, includ-
ing the last four tournaments. 
Dowling credits Florida’s depth as its key to having a solid per -
formance, saying that the No. 
5 player could shoot low just as 
easily as its No. 1. 
Proof of that came in the final 
round of the NCAA Regional when freshman Camilla Hed-
berg’s score was not counted to-
wards the team total. Hedberg leads the Gators in average with a 73.46 and is on pace to set the school record for lowest average 
among freshmen.
Jensen has proven to be a 
valuable player for the Gators 
throughout her time at Florida. In addition to possibly finishing 
in the top 15 for lowest scoring 
average, she has placed in the top 10 in two of the last three tourna-ments, and hopes to do the same 
one final time at her last colle-
giate meet in Franklin, Tenn.
“Evan is just our solid rock,” 
Dowling said. “She’s face a lot of adversity throughout her four 
years here at Florida.
“What she’s done at Florida 
just proves what a competitor is 
and how reliable she is as a per -
son and a teammate.”

self to consistently dominate.
She led the team with six draw controls and propelled 
Florida to a 15-4 team advantage on draws.
“When the ball is up in the air, we’re pretty confident 
(Shannon)’s going to come up with it,” O’Leary said.
“When it’s on the wings we have Kayla (Stolins) and 
Brittany (Dashiell).
“We have a solid group of attackers on the back line 
and a solid group of defenders who can also compete for 
those ground balls. Again, draw con-
trols are just so critical because whoever 
possesses the ball has the opportunity to 
score.”
Florida will now face No. 4 seed Syr -
acuse (18-3) on Friday in Stony Brook, 
N.Y., in the Final Four.
The Gators played the Orange at 
home earlier this season and lost 12-11 
in double overtime. UF scored three goals in the final 
three minutes of regulation to tie the contest 10-10 and 
send the game into overtime.
After exchanging goals in the first overtime, Florida 
could not bounce back from a Syracuse score at the 5:05 
mark in the second overtime.
“I think we’re going to have a lot of fans come out 
there and support us, which is going to help us a lot,” Cullen said.
“But I mean, no matter what field we’re on I think 
we’re just going to play great … I think we have a lot 
more potential and a lot more to come and hopefully 
we’ll be able to bring that out this weekend.” 6-4, 6-1, giving Florida a 2-0 lead.
Mather scored the next point for 
the Gators, coming back from a first-set loss to win the next two sets 6-2, 
6-0. 
Though Florida held a 3-0 lead, 
the match was far from decided, as 
Duke led on the other courts, and the Gators still needed to win one of 
them to clinch the match.
Both Sofie Oyen and Cercone 
each forced a third set after drop-
ping the first, but their third sets 
would play out quite differently.
Oyen won the first game of her 
third set, but quickly fell behind and 
would not be able to recover, losing 2-6. Cercone came back from a 2-0 
deficit in her match, and would not 
relinquish her lead, winning 6-3 and clinching a championship berth for UF.
“Today [Cercone] got outplayed 
and found a way to win the sec-ond,” Thornqvist said.  “She was just a surgeon at the end. She put the ball where she wanted it to be at 
the end.”
Florida will put its 21-match win-
ning streak on the line against UCLA 
with the national championship at 
stake today at 1 against UCLA.
The Bruins come into the cham-
pionship match ranked No. 1 in the 
country, and they lived up to their billing.
They racked up decisive victories 
throughout the early rounds of the tournament, only surrendering one point before their semifinal match.  In the Final Four, UCLA defeated USC 4-3.
“We know they’re a really tough 
team and they’ll give everything they have,” Embree said.
“I’m just really excited for tomor -
row.”TENNIS , from page 13TUESDAY, MAY 22, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — For months 
the Orlando Magic have been trudging 
through the aftermath of a preseason trade request by Dwight Howard that sapped the life out of the franchise as 
internal team issues quickly affected 
the product on the floor.
Now after easily one of the most tu-
multuous seasons in their history, they made the first in what promises to be a huge offseason shake-up
The Magic fired coach Stan Van 
Gundy on Monday and agreed to part 
ways with general manager Otis Smith, 
severing ties with two of the architects 
of one of the most successful runs in franchise history.
Smith and Van Gundy’s relation-
ship with Howard was the centerpiece of drama the team faced all season and following their second straight first-
round playoff exit, CEO Alex Martins 
said the shift was warranted.
“It’s time for a new leadership and 
a new approach,” Martins said at a news conference to discuss the moves. “We simply came to the decision that we were not on the right track,”
Martins wouldn’t go into many 
specifics about what he is looking for 
in replacements, saying only that he 
and ownership want to fill the general manager post by June’s NBA draft.
He said he would sit down with ownership on Tuesday to begin iron-ing out the details of both searches.
Phone and text messages left with 
Van Gundy and Smith by The Associ-ated Press were not immediately re-turned.
Orlando went 37-29 in the regu-
lar season but was eliminated in five games by Indiana after a rash of late-season injuries that included back sur -
gery for Howard. Orlando went 5-12 without him.
Martins said those consecutive first-
round playoff exits were “simply not good enough.”
In early April, Van Gundy claimed 
t o p - r a n k i n g team officials had told him that Howard had asked man-agement to fire Van Gundy as a condition of the 
center signing a long-term contract be-yond 2013. 
Howard denied it.Martins addressed that dispute di-
rectly , saying “At no time during that time did Dwight ask me to have Stan fired.”
With a relationship with Smith dat-
ing back to the Magic’s inaugural sea-
son when Smith was a player and a 
five-year relationship with Van Gundy, Martins also called Monday “the most difficult day of my career.”Both Smith and Van Gundy are un-
der contract through next season and both of their contracts will be honored. The current assistant coaching staff has also been offered the opportunity to stay on for now.
Van Gundy coached the Magic for 
five seasons. He finished with a 259-135 record, going 31-28 in the playoffs.
Smith departs after six years. He 
was the architect of Magic teams that made it to the playoffs in each of those seasons, winning the Eastern Confer -
ence championship in 2009.
But he also made several question-
able moves, including trades for Vince Carter and Gilbert Arenas that failed to work out long-term.
The day after the Magic’s season 
ended with the loss to the Pacers, Smith said that he would need a few days to even decide whether he want-ed to return to that position following the tough year, setting it as a “50-50” 
chance.
Van Gundy said at the time he 
wanted to return and was hoping that 
the ultimate decision would be about performance solely.
“When you’re talking a professional 
relationship, what matters — at least to me — is the results,” Van Gundy said.
“I don’t care if it’s a business rela-
tionship where two people at work are driving a business to make money , or if it’s a sports relationship, where the object is to win games.”

  Steven “Paco” Rodriguez and 
Austin Maddox have been nearly 
unhittable out of the Gators’ bullpen this season. The duo has combined for a 1.82 ERA, a .193 batting aver-
age against and 15 saves in 103.1 in-
nings pitched.
  However, with a share of the 
Southeastern Conference regular season title on the line, Rodriguez and Maddox did not get the job done. The junior relievers surren-dered a two-run lead in the seventh inning of Auburn’s 5-4 win against 
Florida on Saturday.
  “The guys who’ve done it all 
year long, it was just one of those 
days where they didn’t have their best day ,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We were in a position to win a championship because of those guys.”
  Rodriguez bookended his outing 
with two strikeouts, but what hap-pened in between proved costly .   Tigers third baseman Zach Alvord led off the seventh with a single on a full count. Shortstop Mitchell Self followed with a base hit and second baseman Tanner Cimo knocked an 0-2 pitch to left to load the bases.
  Then right ﬁ  elder Creede Simp-
son hit into a ﬁ  elder’s choice, allow-ing Alvord to score and cutting the Florida lead to one.
  Rodriguez fanned the next bat-
ter, center ﬁ  elder Ryan Tella, before O’Sullivan pulled him for Maddox. Designated hitter Justin Bryant worked the count full against Mad-dox before punching out a two-run 
single to give the Tigers a 5-4 lead.
  “We had our best guys on the 
mound in our latter half of the game 
and it worked out the way we want-ed it to,” O’Sullivan said. “Obvious-ly , it’s disappointing, but the game’s over and there’s not much we can do about it now except learn from it and hopefully make some better 
two-strike pitches down the road.”
  Despite the loss Saturday, Flori-
da still won the series due to its im-
proved hitting. The Gators scored 20 runs on 34 hits against the Tigers.   Preston Tucker led the offensive re-surgence, ﬁ  nishing the weekend 8 for 14 with two home runs and ﬁ  ve RBI. Tucker made the ﬁ  nal out Sat-urday when he was thrown out at home.
  “We swung the bat really good 
… that was probably the most im-portant thing coming into the week-end,” O’Sullivan said.
  The defeat dropped Florida to a 
No. 3 seed in the SEC Tournament, which begins today with a match-up against Auburn at 5:30 p.m. in Hoover, Ala. Under new rules set to accommodate Texas A&M and Mis-
souri next season, UF missed out on 
a ﬁ  rst-round bye for the SEC’s top two squads.
  With Jonathon Crawford on the 
mound, the Gators’ bats will look to stay hot against the Tigers’ pitching.
  “In the big picture, our bats are 
going now,” O’Sullivan said. “We’re seeing the ball a lot better, so hope-
fully, moving forward, this will cat-
apult us into being a really good of-fensive team come the postseason.”
