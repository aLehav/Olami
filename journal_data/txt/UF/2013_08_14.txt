getting ready for school
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer sshavell@alligator.org
The first day of Fall classes is quickly 
approaching — are you prepared?
Note-taking and textbook-reading 
aside, here’s what you need to do before 
the semester starts:
1. Locate your classesOn Wednesday, campus will be crazy. 
Add the fact you haven’t been to UF since Preview, and chances are you’ll wind up outside the Reitz Union five minutes be-fore your class starts in the Carleton Au-ditorium. 
So grab a map and locate your class-
rooms. Do an actual run through. Practic-ing your walk to class will help you learn how long it takes to get to various build-ings. That way you won’t be super early the first day, but also, you won’t be late.
2. Map out your bus scheduleYou may think you’ll walk every day or 
ride your bike, but this is Florida — it rains a lot. So map out all routes, just in case, because you’ll likely be taking a bus to get to your classes. 
Find out what time the bus arrives at 
your stop, how long it stays there and what your route will be. Mapping out off-campus bus routes to get to Publix and Target is a good idea, too, if you don’t have a car.
3. Look up your professors onlineDo some research on your teachers. 
Find out what other students have said about them. Will the class be easy or hard? Does the professor read from a Power-Point or interact with students? Is it worth buying the textbook? 
Previous students can usually answer 
these questions. If you don’t know anyone who has taken the course, check out your professors’ evaluations at www.evalu-ations.ufl.edu. This data can be difficult to wade through, so if you’re looking for written comments, try www.ratemypro-fessors.com. Just keep in mind that not ev-eryone has the same opinion as you do.
4. Buy school suppliesIn general, bring a pencil, pen, notebook 
and highlighter to the first day of class. If your professor has emailed you a syllabus, other required supplies are often listed. Also, take a look at ISIS to make sure you know what books you’ll need. 
No matter what you decide to purchase, 
make sure you know the return policy for the store. Some businesses allow returned items until the end of drop/add week, but others don’t give refunds.
5. Find your study spotAmong the most popular study spaces 
are Library West, Marston Library, the Hub, Pugh Hall and the Reitz Union. Find out which atmosphere you like the best. 
Club West might be where all the 
“cool” kids hang out and drink Starbucks during finals, but it can get kind of loud. Marston, on the other hand, can be scar-ily silent if you prefer studying with back-ground noise. 
Take the few days you have before 
classes begin to plan out where you’ll study when exams roll around.Your pre-first day to-do list

Most students probably got a tra-
ditional tour of UF explaining the 
school’s history, important places and resources. But there’s a lot of weird — and awesome — stuff that happens on campus they don’t tell you about.
Turlington Plaza, the North Lawn 
and Plaza of the Americas are all free-
speech zones. Students welcome this show of First Amendment support by passing out fliers and holding rallies. 
But off-campus groups also show 
their support. Almost every day, there’s a guy preaching in Turlington who, by the end of the day, ends up in an argu-ment with a bold student. And usually once a semester, an anti-abortion group brings extremely graphic posters to Pla-za of the Americas.
Also, once a semester, the Humans 
vs. Zombies crew makes an appearance on campus, skulking around with Nerf guns and bright orange bandanas deco-rated with blue “Human” or “Zombie” lettering. It’s a manhunt for college stu-dents on Florida’s biggest playground, and they’re always looking for players. Sign up at www.hvzsource.com/gator-shvz.
In addition, there are all kinds of 
flash mobs. UF’s singing groups make appearances on Turlington Plaza, the Reitz Union and other high-traffic plac-es on campus frequently. Last Spring, a large portion of the student body band-ed together and made a huge, awesome Harlem Shake video.
UF has a club Quidditch team as 
well. Obviously, team members don’t fly around on broomsticks because — sorry, guys — magic isn’t real. But they have the next best thing: PVC pipes in between their legs. 
Everything else is the same, though, 
right down to the golden snitch, which is actually a person dressed in yellow who sprints around the field for the length of the game. And the team is no joke. It won second place at the World 
Cup two years ago. The team hosts open practices on Flavet 
Field. Give it a try.
A little bit off cam-
pus, you can find Dennis Kane busting moves in short-shorts. He was banned from 
campus last year after a student over-heard him making threatening com-ments, but he still makes appearances on West University Avenue near Mid-town and on the corner of Archer Road and 34th Street. He’s an advocate for peace and love, so don’t be afraid to wave as you walk or drive by.
Expect the unexpected at UF

Where you buy textbooks could end up saving you 
hundreds of dollars.
Locally, students have the option of buying from 
the UF Bookstore and Florida Bookstore, among others. 
Online, there’s the obvious Amazon, Chegg, Barnes & Noble and Campus Book Rentals.
Maria Llorens, 22, said she usually ﬁ  nds the best 
prices for used books and e-books on Amazon. 
“I almost never shop at the campus bookstore or buy 
new books since it’s too expensive,” she said.
Freshmen tend to spend more on books by buying 
them new.
“I thought I always needed the edition the professor 
required,” Llorens said. “Now I know you can save $50 to $100 or more by buying an older edition and still do well in the course, even though you’re missing a few pages.”
Monica Uy, a recreation, parks and tourism senior, 
rents textbooks through College Book Rentals.
Purchasing books from UF’s bookstore “was a joke,” 
she said.
Another way to save money is to sell books back at 
the end of the semester. Uy, 21, sells some of her books on Amazon.
“I don’t sell all of them back,” she said. “I feel like 
some of them will eventually become useful to me in life.”Bookstores local and online provide options for students

The Reitz Union has been a staple for stu-
dents since it was built in 1967. It has seen 
many additions and renovations through its time, but now the old Reitz Union will be completely redone.
The $75 million project is being funded 
partially by you, the students. The rest of the money is coming from bonds, loans and investments. It took months to secure the funds. In fact, UF needed approval from the state government to use some of the money.
Since getting approval, proponents for the 
Make it Reitz campaign hit the ground run-ning, and construction began this summer.
The latest project updates have been clos-
ing the colonnade and the south terrace. People who want to enter the union must go through the UF Bookstore, Subway on the north side or at the circle drive, according to the Make it Reitz Twitter account. 
The leaders of the campaign believe the 
renovation and expansion will add more space for student needs. The expansion will add 100,000 square feet for offices and rooms to accommodate the 980 student organiza-tions that use the student union as a port. It will have a new Center for Leadership and Service, in addition to adding a multilevel structure for Student Government and mul-ticultural facilities.
The expansion will also include adding a 
GatorWell Health Promotion Services in the union and more space for the Department of Student Activities and Involvement, accord-ing to the website.
The Orange & Brew, which is located out-
side the Reitz Union near the amphitheater, will also be redesigned.
The project isn’t expected to be finished 
until Fall 2015. Therefore, construction will be going on for a while. However, throughout the process the Reitz Union will stay open.
“Renovation and expansion projects are 
inherently disruptive, but the design team will strive to minimize the impact on daily activities. Sections of the Reitz Union will re-main open and programs, services and facili-ties will continue to be available,” Vice Presi-dent for Student Affairs Dave Kratzer wrote on the Make it Reitz website. “Reitz Union and Student Activities and Involvement staff members are dedicated to making every ef-fort to continue service at the highest levels throughout the project.”
The head designer of the project had pre-
viously said that the contractor plans to work during the weekends and late afternoons to try to minimize distraction for students.

BAM, I’m in the air. Establish a base, head butt, el-
bow to the face, elbow to the groin, shin scrape, foot stomp — I’m free. 
SMACK, I’m pinned to the floor. Ten elbows to the 
face, groin and stomach later, I roll my body out from underneath my assailant. I’m on my feet. 
I’m halfway to the door, and BAM, there’s another 
one. Two front kicks to the groin, three knees to the groin, straight punch to the face, again — I’m running.
This was the final phase of my RAD class. RAD — rape 
aggression defense — is a free self-defense class offered at UF for women, and you should take it.
In Florida, rape occurs every hour and 38 minutes. And 
there’s a 72 percent chance that it occurred at the hands of someone that woman knew — someone she trusted. 
Everything is OK until it isn’t. My own story goes like this: I was sitting off to the 
side, watching my friends recover from the various shots of alcohol they’d previously downed during our bout of Ring of Fire. I had kept it fairly light. I paced myself. Some of my friends, on the other hand, hadn’t. 
When I started toward the bathroom door, I felt a tug. 
It was one of my guy friends, and he had grabbed ahold of me. 
I chuckled nervously and attempted to break his grip, 
but he held tighter, pulling me toward him. He had con-sumed quite a few drinks, much more than I. His eyes were cloudy, far away. He didn’t seem to notice my dis-comfort. 
This friend, whom I had known since ninth grade and 
now weighed well over 200 pounds at six feet, five inch-es, wasn’t my friend all of a sudden.
Everything else is blurry. I remember yanking myself 
forward, hard, out of his grip. I remember him curling his hand around his drink again, putting his back to me. I remember everyone in the room had noticed nothing as I sprinted to sit beside my best friend, shocked and thank-ful all at once for the crowd of people in the room.I was lucky I was with a group 
that night. I had thought that guy was a friend, someone I could trust. I don’t think he knew what he was doing, nor do I think he 
has any recollection of the incident. All I know is people can change in an instant, and you have to be ready for it. 
As women, we are taught we are not as strong as most 
men — as tough as most men — and that we don’t have a fighting chance against a 200-pound, six-foot-five-inch guy. I disagree.
If RAD has taught me one thing, it’s that I have a hell 
of a fighting chance. I now know I can hold my own in any situation. I know how to deliver a devastating punch. I know how to render a man unconscious. I know how to break free from a chokehold. I know how to stay alive. 
I no longer have to rely on third parties to protect me. 
I am my own source of protection. 
RAD teaches you practical defense moves from mild 
to extreme situations so you can tackle everything, from a creep who won’t take his hand off of you at a bar to a man who has you pinned to the ground.
I don’t care how busy you are. If you are a woman, you 
need to take this course. I found the time, so can you.
There are four classes in the course spread out over 
two weeks. Each class is three hours long.
Make the time. You will feel so much better when you 
leave your late-night study session at the library or when you slide into that hot black dress or even when you’re just home alone watching The Daily Show.
Do yourself a favor, and take this class. Safety isn’t 
relative — it’s something you create. 
To sign up for a course, email Tina Lamb at cjlamb@
ufl.edu. The schedule of courses can be found at: www.police.ufl.edu/community-services/rape-aggression-defense-class-schedule-rad/.

How to Navigate 
the In-Between
For most of us, college is a special time. Perhaps for the first 
time ever, we get to experience the unbridled freedom of adulthood while still being afforded the tether of financial 
support. Without parental supervision, a new student might feel inclined to do anything and everything, if only as an experi-ment. Other students might feel frightened and lonely without the support and comfort of their loved ones.
In either case, I hope to convince you that college is, indeed, 
a time that can be very exciting and adventuresome. But as with anything, there are many more wrong ways of doing it than right ways. 
I’ll first address those who are worried about whether they’ll 
make it.
The first thing to keep in mind is you’ll make it. Just take a 
deep breath and trust me on this one. Things will fall into place a lot more easily than you think. If you’re lonely, get to know your neighbors and roommates. Visit various club meetings and get to know people with similar interests. Talk to strangers in class. Most people aren’t so bad once you get to talking with them.
If you want to go the student organization route and you’re 
not sure where to start, the Involvement Team on the third floor of the Reitz Union can help you. Interested in sports or yoga? There’s plenty of that through RecSports.
There’s so much to do, so many open paths for you to wan-
der through and explore. And if it ends up being a problem, maybe take a boyfriend/girlfriend sabbatical for a little while.
Next I’ll address those who are already raring for adventure 
and want to experiment and experience paths, guns blazing. A word of caution: Research everything. Really delve in, and research the physical effects and dangers of whatever it is that you’re wanting to do, be it sex, alcohol or otherwise. Careless-ness has been the root of too many of my own failures here in college.
Like I said before, be elegant about it. There’s a way to have 
fun without ruining everyone else’s fun. In fact, if they find you fun, they’ll probably treat you well and with more respect for it. 
Now I’ll offer some general advice for any new student. I 
mentioned something earlier about autonomy and personhood. Indeed, when you leave this place you should be a much differ-ent person than you were when you came in. You should not only have a title, but you should be a person worthy of the title. By the time this in-between stage is over, you should be ready to take on the mantle of adulthood.
What separates a child from an adult? Financial obligations 
aside, an adult is responsible over his or her obligations. Adults don’t wait around to be told what to do by an authoritative fig-ure. An adult is proactive.
An adult also advocates for his or her own self. If you’re not 
willing to advocate for yourself, who will be?
As you impress yourself with what you’re capable of, you’re 
sure to grow into a more confident being. Become the greatest version of yourself possible. You can do it. Just start down the path, and you’ll be there before you know it.

Welcome, Class 
of 2017, to the University of 
Florida, to Gainesville and to the start of your college experience.
The beginning of the 
school year is always a time of optimism and promise for the future. But that is especially true this year — and with your entering class.
As always, our campus is replete 
with possibilities for different class-es and majors. We have students and faculty from all over the world, qual-ity teaching, exciting research and a huge choice of extracurricular activi-ties.
But this year, for the ﬁ  rst time in 
our 160-year history, Florida’s politi-cal leaders have ﬁ  nancially support-ed our ambitions of becoming one of the top-10 public universities in the country.
Coming after several years of 
state budget cuts, this support – $15 million annually for ﬁ  ve years – has brought a new sense of optimism and energy to campus — one that I feel will enhance your experience as students.
Although rising to the top ten 
will take many years (we are cur-rently ranked at 17th among public universities by U.S. News and World Report), I believe you’ll begin to see progress before you graduate, as we hire prominent new faculty and make other key improvements.
Some of you may wonder why UF needs to make this climb now. The truth is, it’s because of you and the students who will fol-low in your footsteps.
With a population of 
19.3 million and count-ing, Florida will soon displace New York as the third-largest state in 
the country. You and the state’s other best and brightest students deserve a university that is also ranked among the very best in the country. This is true not only when considering the quality of your educational experi-ence while you are here on campus, but also the value of your degrees to employers down the road.
What’s more, if you decide to pur-
sue graduate studies at UF, you de-serve to work closely with scientists and scholars who are recognized as at the top of their ﬁ  elds. We have many of these scientists and scholars now, and adding to their ranks is the main goal of our ﬁ  ve-year initiative.
As you begin your freshman year, 
you also begin a transformation from high school graduate to educated professional.
This year, the University of Flor-
ida is setting out on its own trans-formation, and I couldn’t be more pleased to be joined in that effort by you, the members of the Class of 2017.
Again, welcome to the University 
of Florida, and Go Gators!
Bernie Machen is the president of 
UF.

There are a few basics 
to successful dorm living. Follow this ad-
vice, and you’ll survive with some money to spare. Don’t, and you’ll be broke. Simple, right?
Rule No. 1 is to keep your 
key on you at all times. Keep your key on a lanyard around your neck and fall asleep wearing it if you have to! (Actually, that might be danger-ous, so don’t.)
If you get locked out, you’ll be issued 
a temporary replacement key. You’re al-lowed a number of free lockouts for the whole year, and they run out quickly! Af-ter that, they’ll start charging a bunch of money for each successive lock out.
Rule No. 2 is to familiarize yourself 
with your area. Learn the lay of the land and ﬁ  nd out what services your dorm area can offer you. Every dorm area comes equipped with washing machines and dryers, but did you know that the dorms also have a maintenance service called iService?The next thing that you 
have to realize is your RA is both an employee and a nor-mal person. So, Rule No. 3 is don’t make his or her life a living hell by doing dumb things. Plastic plates will melt and start a ﬁ  re if you put them on the stove or in the oven. This should be obvious. The 
corollary to this is to learn the rules and abide by them. Remember, the RA is also an excellent resource for all of your ques-tions. Don’t be afraid to talk to him or her.
Rule No. 4 is to have fun with it. Dorm 
life is a novel experience. It’s something that can only happen while you’re in col-lege. 
But this leads to our Rule No. 5: Make 
sure you leave after one year. After the novelty has worn off, and after you’ve grown more accustomed to standing on your own two feet, there’s not much use for it. You’ll deﬁ  nitely get your money’s worth if you move off campus.

Hungry? You’re in the right place.
On campus, students have multiple eating 
options.
Cafeterias: To start with, there are two din-
ing halls: Gator Corner Dining Center, located at the intersection of Gale Lemerand Drive and Stadium Road, and Broward Dining Center, which is by its eponymous dorm.
Pick-me-ups: No time to sit and eat? UF of-
fers a number of grab-and-go stations. For the essentials like chips, pre-made sandwiches, fruit and yogurt visit a P.O.D. Market, located on the ground ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union, in the Hub and at the Rawlings bus stop. You can also grab a coffee or pastry from one of the Starbucks found at Library West, the Reitz, the Hub. If your dorm room needs some restock-ing, other convenience stores on campus in-clude Beaty market, Graham Oasis, Little Hall Express, Chomp & Go at Pugh and Hough Halls.
Fast food: There are plenty of fast-food res-
taurants around campus to choose from. The Reitz Union food court offers up Burger King, Papa John’s, Pollo Tropical, Panda Express, Home Zone and Starbucks. For healthier al-ternatives, Turlington Plaza has a Jamba Juice and a Subway. The Hub offers Chick-ﬁ  l-A, Starbucks, a P.O.D. Market and an Einstein Bros. Bagels.
Vegan friendly: For the veggie-lovers, there 
is a Croutons Hand-Crafted Salads in the Reitz Union ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor. Pre-made snacks and pastries can be picked up at convenience stores on cam-pus. With a menu full of soups and salads, the Camellia Court Café in the Harn Museum of Art is also a good option for vegan and veg-etarian students.
But let’s be real. At some point, you’re go-
ing to get sick of on-campus food. Luckily, when this time comes, Gainesville has a spread of delicious restaurants. Here are a few all-time favorites:
The Top. Try the corn nuggets or black bean 
cakes as a starter. For the main course, the res-taurant has a huge collection of burgers with patty options for meat and non-meat eaters, as well as sandwiches and pasta. The restaurant also has a full bar and photo booth, making it a great night-spot. Located at 30 N. Main Street.
The Gelato Co. You would think this res-
taurant would only have gelato (15-20 ﬂ  avors made daily). But their sandwiches are deli-cious. If you order a drink with your meal, you get a free small gelato. Another plus? The restaurant is open until 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Located at 11 SE First Ave. 
Satchel’s Pizza. This is the place you take 
pretty much anyone who’s visiting you from out of town. The pizza alone is impressive enough (get the deep dish!), but the restaurant itself has character that’s just so Gainesville: There’s a table inside of an old-school van, and in the back of the restaurant, you’ll ﬁ  nd the Lightnin’ Salvage junk museum and an ATM, which you’ll almost certainly end up using because the restaurant is cash only. Located at 1800 NE 23rd Ave.
La Tienda. Three words: Authentic Mexi-
can food. The menu includes enchiladas, chi-michangas and other Mexican dishes, most in-cluding ﬂ  avorful green or red mole sauce. Plus, the restaurant has ethnic sodas to accompany your authentic meal. Located at 2204 SW 13th Street.
Dragonﬂ  y. This menu is full of fusion sushi. 
It offers standard options, and then it also has sushi like the surf ‘n turf roll: grilled shrimp, bacon, cucumber, krab delight, asparagus, cream cheese, scallions, beef tataki and teriyaki apple cream sauce. Fun fact: it’s Ryan Lochte’s choice eating establishment for dates. Located at 201 SE 2nd Ave. Suite 104.

After more than a decade of 
working with students at UF, Rabbi 
Berl Goldman said he’s seen stu-dents who were reluctant about religion in high school taking new initiative in college and growing to new depths.
“It’s an interesting phenom-
enon,” said Goldman, the executive director of the Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student and Community Center. “When they come to col-lege, they want to connect on their own terms with their faith. They’re actually choosing to on their own terms with their peers, their friends. It’s encouraging to see those choices being made.”
Paul Gulig, the faculty advisor 
for UF student organization Catho-lic Gators, suggested students who come to college with a strong afﬁ  li-ation look for the campus organiza-tion that coordinates with their de-nomination.
“I think one of the ﬁ  rst things 
[students] should do is ﬁ  nd and get connected with the appropriate congregation, parish... mosque,” he said.
For students who are exploring 
or seeking out stronger belief, he suggested remaining open-minded and positive.
“It’s very common for a lot of stu-
dents when they go away to college to exercise their independence,” he said.  “Do some soul searching. Get connected on the positive side, and see if there’s something there and if it’s something you want to continue working on.”
Katie Doran, a 22-year-old UF 
alumna who recently graduated with degrees in journalism and mar-keting, said ﬁ  nding the balance be-tween involvement in campus min-istries and church was key for her.
“I would... recommend not let-ting campus ministries be your only outlet for your faith,” she said.
She said getting plugged into 
a local church helped her connect with a variety of people from differ-ent backgrounds and with different levels of life experience. Campus provided a forum for connecting with peers.
“Church was a being-built-and-
growing experience,” she said. “Campus is more of a community thing.”
Keeping the faith in college can be tough, but possible at UF

In the Swamp, only Gators get out alive. 
That is, of course, after following a few rules 
to make everyone’s lives a little more enjoy-able on gamedays.
So you won the lottery — congratula-
tions. Now you get to wait in line every Tues-
day through Thursday (the week before each game) at Gate 13 while it’s sweltering hot outside. Whomever you pick up tickets with is whom you’ll be sitting next to. But your friends don’t have to be physically present to claim their tickets. If you get a group of friends together, you can send some ambas-sadors from the group with everyone’s IDs.
But if you didn’t win 
the lottery, you’re not out of luck. The university-ap-proved way to get tickets is to try and buy unclaimed ones Thursday night on www.gatorzone.com. But if you don’t want to wait, you can buy tickets off oth-er students. The best places 
to look are Craigslist and Facebook — try one of the ticket exchange groups. Remember the face value of each ticket is $15, and the closer to the game it is, the cheaper the tickets will likely get. Now for getting into the game. Have your student ID and ticket with you. Don’t try smuggling in alcohol, drinks or snacks while getting into the stadium, because your bags will be checked. Bring cash if you’re hungry for stadium food, or just stuff yourself before you enter. A good idea is to swing by the sta-dium and check out the rules before your first game so you don’t get turned away. 
Stadium etiquette can be a little difficult, 
but a general rule of thumb is to not be a jerk. This includes not standing on the bleach-ers, not being a sloppy mess and not sneak-ing in friends — you’d be surprised how claustrophobic the place can get. Booing the other team is optional, and you’ll hear other students do it, but it’s usually better to take the high road and stay classy — which means yelling “orange” or “blue” at the top of your lungs.Don’t forget UF traditions. Any Gator 
worth his salt will do his best to tailgate before the game, or at least spend the day outside, especially come October. Get some friends to-gether and try a picnic if you can’t get a full-on tailgate going, and enjoy the atmosphere. For home games, come a little early so you can get the whole experience, including the “Two Bits” chant and AC/DC’s “Thunder-struck.” And don’t dare leaving until the third quarter, where the whole stadium links arms and sings “We are The Boys.”

Gamedays are the best days, but the heat can be brutal if you’re not prepared. Make sure you hydrate — with water — before en -
tering Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, because you’ll be yelling, cheering and sweating with thousands of other Gators fans for hours.

Looking past the frat tanks 
and game day dresses, much of UF’s Greek life is rooted in schol-
arship, community service and leadership.
UF has four Greek councils: 
the Interfraternity Council, the Panhellenic Council, the Multi-cultural Greek Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council.
Of the 25 chapters in the In-
terfraternity Council, 24 have houses that can mostly be found on Fraternity Row. The rush pro-cess for the IFC begins Sept. 8 and ends Sept. 12.
The female version of the IFC 
is the Panhellenic Council, which has 16 chapters. All women who decide to rush will be brought to each house, and then they will narrow down their preferences. Rush starts Friday and ends Aug. 25.
The cost for joining can vary 
depending on the chapter. The average cost for the IFC is about $2,800, and for the Panhellenic Council it’s about $3,200.
The Multicultural Greek 
Council is made up of 13 fraterni-ties and sororities rooted in His-panic and Asian cultures. None have houses.
The process for joining dif-
fers based on the group, but you could be asked to do an interview or attend group activities. Dues average around $270.
The National Pan-Hellenic 
Council is comprised of nine his-torically black fraternities and sororities, seven of which have chapters at UF.

� ALWAYS BRING YOUR GATOR 1 CARD.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org 
Maybe you have 10 minutes to get clear across 
campus for your next class. Maybe you and some 
friends want to explore downtown without the hassle of finding parking. Maybe you don’t have a car and need a quick lift to the grocery store.
In many of these cases, walking won’t cut it. 
So how about taking the bus?
But before you hop onto one of Gainesville’s 
Regional Transit System’s many buses, you might want to learn these do’s and don’ts for bus travel. 
First tip: Always bring your Gator 1 Card. That’s your free pass that will take you wher-
ever you need to be. UF and RTS have a deal that includes bus fare in your tuition, so utilize it or be ready to shell out six quarters per ride. 
You can check the bus schedules by using the 
RTS website or the TransLoc App. 
Not only can you see exactly where your bus 
is on a map, but you can also see where each route takes you. 
A second tip: Shower. The bus is great, the bus is convenient, but the 
bus is a packed can of sardines. Sometimes you’ll be so jammed together that you’ll able to smell what your buddy had for breakfast yesterday. Make sure when people wrinkle up their noses, it’s not because you skipped out on body wash.
On that note, be courteous to you bus driver 
and fellow passengers. Don’t be the girl or guy taking up four seats for their backpack, cell phone and ego.
Also, avoid talking on the phone loudly for 
long periods of time. Your constant jabbering is annoying enough to make other people wish they had decided to be Seminoles.
Make sure you offer up your seat to those 
who need it more than you do. If someone else clearly could benefit from a seat and they’re all occupied, take a stand by standing the rest of your ride. 
Lastly, know that using the Later Gator bus at 
night to gallivant around Midtown and Down-town is incredibly convenient. 
The last Later Gator runs until 3:05 a.m., and 
most of the time the bus drivers are ready and willing to deal with drunken college student shenanigans like the infamous Later Gator back-flip.Take advantage of the busesLIFESTYLE

Looking for ways to ward off the 
freshman 15? Campus has you cov-
ered.
The newly remodeled Student Rec 
Center is the perfect place to catch a Zumba, Total Body or Cycle class. The weight room is typically more laid back and less crowded than the Southwest Recreation Center. 
It also offers a pool with lane 
lines. Because of Student Rec Cen-ter’s location near the Hub, it’s easy to throw gym shoes in your back-pack and pop in for a speedy work-out or swim between classes.
Southwest Rec boasts a one-
eighth-mile indoor track and a two-story large weight room with a vari-ety of machines.
It even has treadmills that play 
videos simulating running routes in other countries while you jog. Before you start, grab a locker to stash your keys and wallet in.
You can always try stopping by 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium for the clas-sic weekday on-campus workout. Zig-zag up and down the steps in the bleachers and job through the spiraling ramps.
When you’re finished, take a seat 
overlooking Florida Field and cool off while admiring the empty field and enjoying the breeze. Spending time in the Swamp when the thou-sands of gameday fans are absent is just one of the things that makes you want to say, “It’s great to be a Florida Gator.” (The newly painted wall even shows that slogan).
The Percy M. Beard Track is 
closed right now for resurfacing, but when it reopens in September with updated public hours, grab your running shoes and go check it out. 
Need inspiration for running? 
This is where UF hosts track and field meets. Welcome to the big leagues.
And finally, don’t underestimate 
the sidewalks and bike lanes: Your tuition money pays for them. You should use them.

all of UF’s exercise facilities at www.recsports.ufl.edu/facilities/facility-hours/week/2013/08/26.Exercise is easy on campus

� KNOW WHERE YOU CAN 
AND CAN’T PARK.
MATT RIVA
Alligator Staff Writer mriva@alligator.org
Parking on campus is a game 
of numbers. Is it cheaper to buy 
a pass or just park at the Reitz? How long will it be before I can park somewhere without getting a ticket? How long will it take me to find a space on game days?
(Alright, that last one was a 
trick question. The answer is how-ever long it takes to make your own spot in a tow-away zone like everyone else.)
All decals can be bought for the 
entire school year for $154, or per semester at $77. Any decal not for a scooter can also be purchased monthly ($35) and weekly ($15).
But if you’re an undergrad 
planning on living off-campus and are not in a fraternity or sorority, your spot will likely be pretty far from where you’re headed.
You get a Park & Ride decal, 
which doesn’t really allow for any parking north of Lake Alice or — roughly — east of Fraternity Row. This probably means taking one of several buses to and from your car.
Graduate students in the same 
situation can get a Green de-cal, which is a little better, offer-ing spots near the O’Dome and Hume.
Living on campus is another matter. There are basically two decals for undergrads: Red 1 and Red 3. Red 3 is for those who have less than 50 credit hours, and gets you as far as Fraternity Row, Fla-vet Field and Hume. Red 1 is for those with 50 credit hours or more, and is a little more expansive, giv-ing you access to Keys, Murphree, Beaty Towers and Sorority Row.
If you have an evening class or 
meeting, your best best is to take note of hour restrictions at areas in which you can’t normally park during the day. Orange lots will get you closest to the Reitz and stadium, and anyone is free to park there after 4:30 p.m. Small areas near Turlington are Gated (Purple) during the day, but open to all at 5:30 p.m. Service drives, however, are always grounds for a ticket or a tow.
What else? Brown 2 is for stu-
dents in Corry and Maguire Fam-ily Housing Villages (near Lake Alice and Southwest Recreation Center, respectively), and Brown 3 is for students in Diamond Fam-ily Housing Village (near Beaty Towers).
Motorcycle/scooter is fairly 
self-explanatory, and disabled students have access to Disabled, Orange, Blue, Green, Red, Brown, and “Any Decal” parking areas.
Got all that? Well, fear not, be-
cause if it seems like too much, you could just pony up the $1 for 45 minutes at the Reitz garage.
Or, you know, take the bus.
The rules of parking at UF

It’s important to know who’s who in 
Gainesville’s government and how to 
get involved.
At the top of the political food chain 
is Mayor Ed Braddy. Though he is a new mayor just elected in April, Braddy served as District 2 city commissioner from 2002-2008.
Braddy is no stranger to the city 
of Gainesville or its government. He has lived in Gainesville since 1991 and earned a degree in history from UF.
Aiding the mayor in his duties are 
the city commissioners. They pass the city’s budget, decide on ordinances and resolutions, and host City Commission meetings that are open to the public.
The current city commissioners are 
Thomas Hawkins (at-large), Lauren Poe (at-large), Yvonne Hinson-Rawls (Dis-trict 1), Todd Chase (District 2), Susan Bottcher (District 3) and Randy Wells (District 4).Regular city commission meetings 
are scheduled for the first and third Thursday of each month.
Alachua County has a separate set of 
commissioners as well, including Mike Byerly (District 1), Lee Pinkoson (District 2), Robert Hutchinson (District 3), Susan Baird (District 4) and Charles Chestnut IV (District 5).
County commis-
sion meetings are held the second and fourth Tuesday each month in the County Admin-istration Building.
Contact informa-
tion for the city and county commissioners 
can be found at www.cityofgainesville.org and www.alachuacounty.us. 
Stay in the know and attend pub-
lic meetings. If you have something to bring to the city or county’s attention, there are allotted times for citizen com-ment where you can speak your mind.WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 14, 2013 � NEW STUDENT EDITION,  ALLIGATOR, 17

Being accepted into The Gator Nation left 
me with a bittersweet feeling. I was excited 
to pack up and head to the Swamp, but I worried if I had made the right decision. 
How could I commit to bleeding orange 
and blue when my closet was full of green and gold? As a transfer student from the University of South Florida, coming to a new school in the middle of my college career seemed daunting.
How do you feel like a Gator when you’re 
used to rooting for the opposing team?
Get into gamedayEven if you never went to a sporting 
event at your old school, being in a college stadium can make you feel a part of some-thing. You don’t need to paint your entire body, but going to at least one game will get you one step closer to being a Gator. Plus, you’ll be amazed at what adding a little or-ange and blue to your wardrobe can do to your spirit.
Take a tourYou probably knew where every build-
ing on campus was at your old school. But even if all your classes are in the same room at UF it doesn’t hurt knowing where things are. Get acquainted with the campus — You don’t want to have to ask someone where a building is, and not even have the excuse of being a freshman.
Buddy up a professorProfessors in your college have had the 
opportunity to take note of your peers for the past two years. Being the new guy in town, it’s important to set up a time to meet with your professors and introduce your-self. Feeling like a Gator can be as simple as building a friendly relationship with a fac-ulty member. You can’t feel a part of UF if not one professor knows your name. Plus, when the time comes to ask for reference let-ters you’ll be glad you made the effort.
Join a clubMeeting new people can be hard as a 
transfer student — by junior year many students have established their core group of friends on campus. Maybe it’s one of the most obvious suggestions, but joining a club or an intramural sport can be a great way to feel like you’re a part of university life and make friends. There is practically a club for every interest; it doesn’t hurt to try one or two out.
If all else fails, at least learn the words to 
“We Are the Boys.”
Transfers can feel like Gators, too

Staying healthy
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Staff Writer jwerley@alligator.org
An inevitable fact of college is 
eventually, you will feel bad. 
You may get mono, you may ex-
perience panic attacks or you might 
twist your ankle (or you might have all three happen the same semes-ter). 
For what is possibly the first time 
in your life, your parents won’t be there to care for you.
Luckily, there are many resourc-
es on campus to utilize, and a lot of them are included in your student fees, which means (almost) free healthcare!
Student Health Care Center:Also known as the infirmary, this 
conveniently located building (280 Fletcher Drive, next to the Racquet Club) is your one stop shop for most health needs. Go if you think you’re getting ill, sprained something, need or flu shot or even need to do blood work. Ladies, you can even go for all of your gynecological needs. Most general care appointments are cov-ered with your health fee and insur-ance. The infirmary is appointment only, so call first (352-392-116) or use their online scheduler before you go. You can also visit the health care centers at Shands or Corry Village. Bring your insurance card with you, if you have health insurance.
Counseling and Wellness Cen-
ter: 
Soon, dear freshman, you will 
realize just how stressful college is. Many a first year student before you has suffered anxiety, depression or panic from being away from home. It happens to more people than you would think. Luckily, UF has an excellent wellness center, located on Radio Road, that is there for just about any mental or emotional need you could think of. Schedule a consultation (call 352-392-1575) and the health professionals there can help refer you to services like indi-vidual counseling, group therapy, workshops, couples therapy, etc. If you think you need help, make an appointment early, the wait can get long for the free services. And if you have an emergency, don’t hesitate to call.
Disability Resource Center:This office, which is a little hid-
den on the ground floor of Reid Hall, is where you can go if you think you qualify for disability help. Accom-modations they offer may include note taker services, extended test time or priority registration. But the service isn’t for just anyone, docu-mentation (usually from your doc-tor) and an intake appointment is required before they can determine what you qualify for. If you think this may be the center for you, give them a call at 352-392-8565, exten-sion 200.
Shands isn’t the only place to go when you’re feeling sickADAM LICHTENSTEIN

College is less like the movies and a lot closer to 
real life, and most of those myths you’ve probably 
heard have been passed down from older students just trying to scare or fool freshmen.
Like, here’s one: Sororities are strictly regulated 
due to brothel laws.
As the legend goes, sorority houses at some 
campuses are limited because outdated laws against prostitution houses prohibit five unrelated women from living together. But the area around the campus is littered with sorority houses. And a quick search of the City of Gainesville Code of Or-dinances shows no law prohibiting any gathering of women.
Another: A psychic predicted murders on a col-
lege campus on national TV, and it came true.
Nope. First off, who believes in psychics any-
way? But on a serious note, in 1990, Danny Rolling murdered five college students, four from UF and one from Santa Fe. The murders became known as the “Gainesville Ripper” killings and served as the inspiration for the movie “Scream.”
And lastly, there’s: If a virgin graduates from 
UF, a brick falls out of Century Tower.
I’m not saying this one is true, but it looks like all 
the bricks are still in place. Draw your own conclu-sions.Don’t believe everything you hearKATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
Here at UF, police are not the en-
emy.
In fact, University Police offers 
a host of resources for students to 
have a safe college experience.
To prevent bike theft — the most 
common type of theft on campus — students can register their bikes with the department, said UPD Of-ficer Jason Vinson.
Students are advised to bring 
in their bikes into the department, located on Museum Road near Jen-nings Hall, so officers can take the serial number from the items and add them to a database complete with the student’s name, address and contact information, Vinson said.
In return, students will get a 
sticker decal to put on their bikes. Vinson said the decal could deter thieves and would help police locate the bike in case it did get stolen.
“Sometimes police find the bike 
before the victim even realizes it’s stolen,” Vinson said.Technology can be registered, 
too. Students can download Front Door Software, which allows users to lock their computers from a re-mote location to prevent criminals from accessing them.
UPD also offers the Student 
Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol (SNAP), a free taxi service that shuttles stu-dents around campus between 6:30 p.m. and 3 a.m. Students can book a trip over the phone, online or on its app.
“We’re there for the students,” 
Vinson said.

Let’s face it. You want to date 
around and play the ﬁ  eld because 
you’re a college student. But, on the other hand, you’re desperate for date ideas and ﬂ  at broke — be-cause you’re a college student. 
College is the perfect time to 
ﬂ  ex your frugal muscles, and luck-ily, Gainesville is a great location to help you get your creative juices ﬂ  owing. 
Movies at the local theatre are a dating go-to, but they’re boring and can get expensive. Instead, drop a few dimes and take your date to the Hippodrome, a down-town venue that features plays, musicals and sometimes movies.   
Interested in dinner with a 
beautiful backdrop, but don’t want to pay the ﬁ  ve-star restaurant price? Pack up a picnic basket and take your date to dinner under the stars. 
Still wanting to plan the best 
date this side of the moon?  Use the telescopes at the UF observatory to gaze upon the galaxy together. The observatory is free and open to the public Fri-
day nights from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m.
For the adventure-seeking cou-
ples who want an outdoors-y date, Gainesville offers endless miles of hiking, walking and biking trails.  Check out the La Chua Trail and Bolen Bluff trail at Payne’s Prairie to see alligators, bison and wild horses. Or sink into adventure at Devil’s Millhopper and walk the sinkhole trails. 
If you and your date are look-
ing for a musically infused night on the town, check out what local bands are playing at The Jam. Of-ten, there is no cover, and some-times there are open mic nights, so you and your date can get up on stage and let loose.  
The Santa Fe Zoo charges only $4 for UF students, and they fea-ture an abundance of mammals, reptiles and birds. This darling day date will leave your signiﬁ  cant other swooning over your sensitiv-ity for cute animals. 
Lastly, if you’re searching for 
a relaxing date, a sun tan and are willing to shell out a few dollars to drive, pack up the car and head to-ward Ginnie Springs to ﬂ  oat down the river. It’s a win-win: You get the chance to connect with your date while you bask in the sunshine.

Eating on campus doesn’t have to be expen-
sive. 
Many of UF’s 45 dining options offer deals 
for students to get the best bang out of their 
buck.
Hanna Hein, a 17-year-old UF animal sci-
ence freshman, said Flex Bucks and declining balance are both great options that give stu-dents the freedom to eat at different places.
“In the Fall I plan on doubling up on both 
declining balance and cooking for myself,” Hein said. “With the declining balance, it will help me to manage my money and plan how I want to allocate them.”
You can link your bank account to your 
Gator 1 Card and use it to buy items at the UF Bookstore, pick up a snack at a vending ma-chine or gain access to dining halls on cam-pus.
The cost of a seven-day, open-access meal 
plan for Fall costs $1,896 with tax. This plan includes $100 of Flex Bucks and the ability to visit Gator Corner Dining Center and Fresh Food Company as many times as your stom-ach can handle.
If you’re going to want three meals a day, 
the unlimited meal plan is your best option, said 18-year-old UF journalism student Chris-tine Thomas.
“It’s really convenient to have the ability 
to set up your Wells Fargo account with your Gator 1 Card,” Thomas said. “It’s your every-thing when you’re a student. You need to have it on you at all times because it is your meal card and the way you identify yourself after taking a test.”
Although the bank options are convenient, some students are concerned there aren’t enough affordable deals on campus.
Giselle Ponce, a 19-year-old telecommuni-
cation sophomore, said she doesn’t think the food places on campus want to help students out on saving money.
“Subway is the only place I can go to and 
get a full meal under $5,” Ponce said.
She said that some factors that inﬂ  uence stu-
dents to eat out instead of cooking include the convenience of grabbing something on the go and the time you save eating out. The Reitz is a great central place on campus to do just that.
The lowest priced items at Subway include 
a yogurt for $1.50, cheese pizza for $3.47 and ﬁ  ve options for a $5 foot long. Students looking to stretch their dollar can visit the Burger King located in the Reitz Union, which has $6 menu items and is one of few places that serves low-priced items for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Burger King offers its Whopper Jr. for $1.59 and its apple pie for $1. Not to mention that Panda Express, Croutons for you salad lovers and Pollo Tropical are among many Reitz alter-natives to mix up your daily food choices.
While the Hub is one of the busiest loca-
tions on campus, it provides quiet study areas as well as low priced meal options. Students studying for exams can enjoy a Starbucks 12-ounce brewed coffee for $1.75 or a cookie for $2.25. The cheapest deals at the P.O.D. Market include 10-cent Pixy Stix and a 99-cent table of goodies stocked with Oreos, Stride gum and Hershey’s chocolate bars. If you’re eating on a budget, you can stop by the Chick-ﬁ  l-A located in the Hub and purchase a medium wafﬂ  e fry or medium drink for $1.79.
David Looney, the associate director for 
Business Services, said the 45 points of service on campus have special offers from time to time.
“I think we do a great job of meeting the 
needs of the majority of students,” Looney said. “We continuously evaluate students’ needs and look for ways to bring great food options to campus.”Finding food deals on campus

In 2008, Gainesville was named the “Best 
Place to Start a Band in the United States” by 
Blender magazine. Since then, the music scene has grown and changed with the addition of new music bars and clubs, festivals and con-certs. Gainesville is enriched with musical tal-ent and entertainment venues.
The JAM, located at 817 W. University 
Ave., is a hip music bar where students can go to hear live music of all genres. According to its website, every night of the week has a different theme. There’s Live Jazz Monday, Reggae Tuesday, World Wednesday and Live Bands Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The in-struments resting onstage and hanging from the walls are just waiting to be played by the bar’s customers. The JAM encourages anyone to jump on stage and entertain the crowd.
High Dive, located downtown at 210 
SW 2nd Ave., is another live music bar in Gainesville. According to its website, in the past the High Dive has hosted “American Idol” season 8 winner Kris Allen, the Cana-dian indie-rock group Japandriods, as well as other local and well-known bands from all over. What makes High Dive special is its out-side bar that’s decorated with white Christmas lights. But the High Dive doesn’t just host mu-sical events. This summer, the venue hosted the Hurly Burly Male Burlesque show as well as food truck rallies.
The City of Gainesville hosts Free Fridays 
at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, located downtown at 111 E. University Ave., every Friday from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. until November. “Little Jake Mitchell and The Soul Searcher” played during African-American Music Ap-preciation Month in June, among others. Ac-cording to the website, the concerts feature local talent and bands in surrounding regions with a wide musical selection, including blues, reggae and Latin fusion. All you need is a blanket and a lawn chair to enjoy the outdoor concert.
Fest, a multi-day, multi-venue music fes-
tival, is held annually in Gainesville. This year, it’s from Oct. 31 to Nov. 3. According to its website, Fest features underground punk, hardcore, indie and alternative-country bands from all over. Last year, the festival hosted more than 307 bands. This year’s festival will begin with a Pre-Fest in Tampa on Oct. 29 and Oct. 30.

Looking for a place to pop 
some tags? Only got $20 in your 
pocket?
Don’t worry. Gainesville has 
some great treasure troves sure to satisfy your thrift shop addic-tion.
Goodwill: There’s two of the 
franchise secondhand stores in Gainesville, and they both have their pros and cons. 
The store located at 3520 SW 
34th St. is in the hub of Gaines-ville’s college apartment complex and retail district. The store is huge, spacious and conveniently located. 
At the store 
at 2624 NW 13th St., don’t let size or location fool you. Nestled next to a party supplies store in 
an out-of-the-way strip mall, you can find an ever-changing variety of clothes, jewelry and house-hold items. Because the location is harder to spot from the road, the selection seems less “picked over.”
Flashbacks Recycled Fash-
ions, 509 NW 10th Ave. The store’s Facebook page the se-lection as “name brands, mall brands, punk, goth, urban, prep, hippie, retro, vintage.” Be sure to check out the selection of inter-esting, affordable jewelry.
Sandy’s Savvy Chic Resale 
Boutique, 4148 NW 13th St. OK, so maybe you can’t find your granddad’s clothes in this posh place, but you’re sure to find trendy items for cheap (check out the jewelry — most items are about $3). You can also sell your fashionable items to the store if you’re looking to make some quick cash. Like them on Face-book to keep up with their latest deals and steals.
Plato’s Closet, 3441 W. Uni-
versity Ave. This is another resale boutique that offers cutting-edge fashions for minimal moohla, and it’s also a good place to resell your clothes. 
Cecile’s Clothing Resale and 
Consignment, 2131 NW 6th St. If you’re looking for vintage pieces, this little store is legit. Come here to dig up clothes, knick-nacks, jewelry and accessories with oth-er-era flair. Check out the baskets of LP vinyls for sale, too.‘But it was

BROOKE PERRY
Avenue Writer
Being a new student on a campus of nearly 
50,000, chances are you want to do so many 
new things you get overwhelmed just thinking about them all. But slow down there, newbies. There are also several things you will want to avoid at all costs.
1. Looking like a freshmanThis bullet can be dodged in just a few easy 
steps. First, take off that lanyard. We have all made the mistake of wearing our new Pre-view handout proudly around our necks. When you remove the jingling dorm key, fob and whatever else is hanging on that clunky thing, you also lower your chances of stand-ing out like the freshman you are. Secondly, try to avoid wearing too much orange and blue. School spirit is great, but if you’re blend-ing into the walls in The Swamp, it might be overkill. Limit two Gator items per outfit. And lastly, avoid getting lost. Never be afraid to ask for directions, but check out where your classes are located the day before school starts, and practice getting to them from the place you will be right before then.
2. Lines and most Turlington handoutsIf there is ever a line for an elevator or it 
seems to be taking a while and the floor you need to get to is a single digit number, take the stairs. You will probably end up getting there faster and burning calories at the same time. It’s a win-win. If you are not aware of this yet, Turlington Plaza is a common place for people to hand you fliers you most likely won’t care about and will end up throwing away. Some of these people are very persistent and will not let you just walk away. You can try to divert the situation by walking around it, avoiding eye contact by noticing you just happened to get a new text (wink, wink) or by making your hands full. Double-fist some notebooks, carry your backpack like a baby — be creative. But also know that sometimes you can get some pretty cool handouts in this area as well as at the Reitz, from T-shirt giveaways to free piz-za.
3. Sleep deprivationAlthough the college lifestyle is rumored 
to be a sleep-free zone full of all-nighters, it is important to get rest. Sleeping well helps your memory and keeps your immune sys-tem healthy. A Healthy Gators student survey completed in Spring 2013 showed that 43 per-cent of students woke up for the four to seven days before the survey was taken feeling rest-ed. This advice is not for everyone, but moving into a new environment can alter many habits. Don’t let this be one of them.
“Research shows that teens and young 
adults need nine to 10 hours of sleep,” said GatorWell Health Promotion Specialist Jane Emmeree.
Emmeree explained that people should be 
able to tell how they’re sleeping by how they wake up. If having trouble sleeping, evaluate the environment you are in by temperature, noise and light. Choices you’ve made through-out the day can also affect you here, like drink-ing too much caffeine. But live and learn.
“Protect your sleep,” Emmeree said, “It 
influences every area of your life: academics, relationships, emotional health, and physical well-being.”
4. RainUnfortunately, this one is unavoidable. Al-
ways carry an umbrella, even if it looks like it will be a perfect day. Gainesville has a way of pouring down rain without warning, and it can either be a short shower or a few hours of Hurricane Albert. Rain boots and rain jackets are wise purchases, too.
5. FailingIf you are struggling in classes, always go 
to your professor for help. Sometimes you might be in a class with 300 other people, so knowing your teacher is important.
“On the first day, introduce yourself to the 
teacher and turn yourself from a number to a face,” First Year Florida instructor Matt Pend-leton said. “If you ever need help in a class, it’s a lot easier when you have that personal con-nection.”
Attendance is also important, even if your 
class is online. If there is an option to attend an online class in person, do it. It is also a good idea to completely read your syllabus, and during the first week of classes, write all due dates in a planner.
“Clear your mind about what high school 
was,” he said. “College is your full-time job. You are employed by the university, and your job is to pass these classes.”

a new environment, and you’re feeling the birth pangs of your newfound adulthood. Nostalgic for your family and the nutrition they gave you, you must now cut the umbilical cord and find your own source of nutrition. How can you do this without starving or go-ing broke?
Follow these simple rules.Rule number one: Don’t, don’t, 
don’t buy a meal plan. The meal plan is an absolute scam. The food looks great during Preview, but it’s not that great once you’ve got a meal plan, especially not at such a steep price. The portions are small, badly cooked and don’t taste very good.
I’m not blaming the staff of the 
Gator Dining locations. They do the best they can with the resources they’re given. They work really hard, but until there are some ma-jor changes with the dining pro-gram, it’s not worth the money.Besides, why would you de-
prive yourself of the experience of learning how to stand on your own two feet by cooking your own meals? It’s better to learn to cook for yourself now as a freshman, while you have time, rather than finally conceding as a junior, when you’ll have significantly less time.
Rule number two is to develop 
a plan. This rule requires a couple of steps. The first step is to deter-mine what your body requires in order to thrive. Harvard’s Nutri-tion Source website is an excellent resource. The major parts of any meal should be vegetables and protein. Grains aren’t seen as the “staff of life” anymore. A diet of ra-men noodles might keep you alive for now, but you might be making plenty of hospital visits later in life. It’s much cheaper to just eat right now, and it doesn’t have to cost too much. 
The second step of this rule is 
to come up with a list of potential meals for yourself for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Maybe breakfast is eggs, spinach and some orange juice. Maybe one night’s meal con-sists of chicken, mixed vegetables and rice. You don’t have to come up with a ton of different, com-plex meals. Keep it simple, silly. One night’s chicken might be in a spicy stir fry, while the next night’s chicken could have a more Latin flavor. 
If you need ideas for meals, just 
look them up on the Internet. There are plenty of sites dedicated to col-lege students specifically.
The third step of this rule is to 
figure out the hardware you need and get it. If you’re reading this while your parents are still in town, recruit their help. You might need a fridge, a pan, a pot and a spatula. That’s all I needed for a while.
Rule number 
three is to buy in bulk. This step, 
the actual buying, is the trickiest be-
cause you prob-ably don’t have a car. Fortunately, 
Gainesville’s bus service is superb. Familiarize yourself with where the stores are and which routes travel there. Be aware that routes are dif-ferent on weekends. Download the TransLoc Transit Visualization app to track the buses in real time. 
I highly recommend a Sam’s 
Club card. It’s a little bit of a walk from the bus stop to the store, but if you go frequently enough the membership will more than pay itself off. 
If you think that you don’t have 
time to make one trip a week to the grocery store, then make time. I promise you that you can make time for this trip. Make sure you bring a big backpack with you and maybe even a couple of totes.
The fourth rule is to buy frozen 
goods. I can’t emphasize enough how awesome buying frozen is. There has been some debate as to whether certain foods are more nu-tritious when purchased frozen or less nutritious. In either case, I’m not sure you can go too wrong buy-ing frozen. It’s way cheaper than buying fresh, and canned is prob-ably poisonous thanks to Bisphenol A (BPA). 
The fifth rule is to have fun 
with it. At first, you won’t know what you’re doing. Start out by fol-lowing some recipes as closely as you can, or ask a friend about their techniques. Just keep at it, and be-fore you know it you’re going to want to start experimenting. As al-ways, exercise safety. Never leave the stove unattended!
The last rule is on spoilage. 
There are three ways of knowing if a food is not safe for eating, and they’re all free, provided by evolu-tion by natural selection. The first is to use the nose, because the nose knows. That fantastic device can detect if the chemicals in a food have become infested with organ-isms or compounds that are bad for you. If it smells bad, don’t second-guess your nose — It knows!
The second way of knowing if 
your food is spoiled is to use your eyes. Sometimes your seasoning will keep the food smelling nice, but if you just look at it, then you’ll know that there’s something grow-ing on it.
If your vision is impaired, re-
member what seasonings you used and the smell of the food before it was stored. Any amount of spoil-age will yield a different smell, but sometimes it’s too subtle for most to detect.
The last method to use is the 
taste test. If it tastes bad, spit it out and throw it away. It won’t nourish you. It will poison you. 
A good diet coupled with exer-
cise and enough sleep should make for a healthier body and mind. It’s an investment. Not only will you feel better, look better, and do bet-ter in class, but you’ll save on those hospital visits I mentioned earlier. 
It might seem like a lot now, but 
you’ll have it all down in no time, champ.

Don’t be afraid of the people at 
the beginning of the year shoving 
those thick coupon booklets in your face. These people are some of your ﬁ  rst friends you will make in col-lege, so to speak. These are the peo-ple offering you discounts on daily needs. Why so important, you ask?
1. Don’t ﬁ  ght the lovin’. These 
people, whether they are students or just volunteers, have taken their time and undoubtedly some sweat from the August heat to bring over boxes of coupon books to Turling-ton Plaza on campus just to help make your life easier. The least you can do is give these men and wom-en the time of day. People will come at you with ﬂ  iers and handouts all the time on campus throughout the year, but this is the one guaranteed to beneﬁ  t you.
2. You will actually use them (if 
you don’t lose them). If you don’t 
toss the books upon gathering or place them into some deep, dark corner of the room to never be seen again, you will have use for coupon books. You will totally forget about them until you actually see one lay-ing there like a forgotten childhood 
stuffed animal. Not to mention they last all se-mester, so there isn’t a one-week expiration that most too-good-to-be-true cou-
pon books have. And you can get one each semester. You’ll pick it up, browse through the pages and behold:3. You will, without a doubt, go 
to one of the places offering dis-counts in the books. After looking 
through the thick coupon book, it is a certainty you have gone or will go to one of the restaurants/shops in the booklet anyway. Just take ﬁ  ve minutes to remove the ones you would use, stick them in your wallet and next time you look in there — thinking of the money you don’t have and the hunger in your belly — you will see the coupon and go to that location to save some money. And, they are actually great deals. From discounts on oil chang-es to BOGO smoothies at Tropical Smoothie Café and a discounts on game day dresses at Allure Bou-tique, you would have gone to one of these places anyway. Now you’ll just be getting a discount.
4. You’re broke. Face it: You are 
a broke college student. And if you aren’t now, you will be after a few years of insane student costs. Your car may break down, you will want some new clothes, and you have to eat. Every dollar counts. 
Repeat after me: Coupon books 
are amazing. Coupon books are useful. I love you, coupon books.
Take them, use them, love them: An ode to coupon books

Having a UF student ID — regardless of 
how hideous the picture on it from Preview 
is — comes with a few perks. The benefits are money-saving, time-saving and all around your ticket to making life in Gainesville just a tad easier.
1. Drink specialsYou will undoubtedly rack up a huge tab 
over the span of your time at UF — let alone in one night at a relatively decent bar, club or restaurant. There are certain magical days that boast discounts for drinks to college stu-dents. This will probably be advertised in the form of “Student Night,” “College Night” or “Young People Rock Night.” OK, that last one was a stretch, but the first two will let you know that you can finally get your drinks at a discount — whether it’s BOGO or half off — just for being a student.
2. Free Regional Transit System bus 
rides.
Gainesville can easily seem like it is to-
tally dominated by the university, but even-tually, you will want to venture outside the brick walls. Those big blue RTS buses are free when you show your Gator 1 Card. And parking around Gainesville and on campus, in general, is so limited that it is infuriating.
3. Free Lake Wauburg accessAmong the parks, bike trails and swim-
ming pools near UF, there’s the UF-owned gem that is Lake Wauburg. Present your Gator 1 Card, and you and your car of peo-ple — assuming you didn’t clown-car-pack everyone in — can use the facilities. You can lay out on one of the chairs, dip your toes in the slightly murky waters, swan dive off the dock, rent a kayak, explore every inch of the lake, paddleboard and so much more. 
4. Discounted movie ticketsOK, this is a general student thing, but the 
discounted student tickets at the local movie theaters are actually pretty decent. Take your Gator 1 Card to get on the RTS bus — don’t forget the free part — and a discounted stu-dent ticket will provide you with not a bad way to spend an evening away from cam-pus.
5. Cheap game day 
tickets
If you didn’t know al-
ready, gamedays at UF are no joke. Football is an obvi-ous first thought when the term “gameday” arises, but having a Gator 1 Card 
will also give you access to basketball games, gymnastics meets and other sports events at UF. Not only does being a student at UF al-low you to enter the football ticket lottery — if you didn’t do it this year, it is well worth it next year — but if you win, it guarantees a seat at every home game, provided you pick up the tickets. Even if you didn’t enter or win the lottery, unclaimed tickets are $15 a pop and are only for UF students. Those other sports? Free for UF students. The Gators are good at sports. Seats will fill quickly. 
6. Gator NightsGator Nights may not seem like the most 
happening way to spend a Friday night, but when you don’t know where to go and are confined to campus, then free movies, pop-corn and game booths at the Reitz Union aren’t so bad. This especially holds true on those nights with free improv from Theatre Strike Force, pancakes and crafts. It’s a great way to meet new people and have some free fun. Just don’t forget that Gator 1 Card.

international studies. Would you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m a girl and I like to go out a 
lot. I just want to hang out with my 
girls and sometimes a few guys will try to talk to us. I’m okay with that, but how do I get the creepy 
annoying ones off of my back?
Dear Friend,
Tell them you used to be a man. If they believe you, there is an enormous chance 
they will just walk away. If they don’t believe you, they will be really impressed at 
how far you would go to make a guy leave you alone and understand they are not 
welcome. Not everyone has the balls to say they used to have a dick.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been flirting with this guy for 
a while and sometimes he flirts back. 
I feel like I’m really putting myself out there. I want to hook-up, but he doesn’t seem to get the message. 
Why are some guys such pussies?
A guy is not a pussy if he does 
not flirt back or want to have sex with 
you. He’s not interested or just not in -
terested as much as you are. Maybe he’s into one of your friends. You may want to hook-up, but do not assume that he knows that. Don’t encourage guys to make a move on anyone that smiles back at them. It’s confusing to guys and pisses off the girls that were never flirting in the first place. If you want to make a move, do it, but don’t go running around saying some guy is a wimp because he doesn’t want to 
f--- you back.Dear Mediocre Advice,
How do I get into UF?
Dear Friend,
Study your a-- off and quit 
dicking around. If you have 
not chosen a major yet, pick something non-competitive. It is completely true that you can do anything you set your mind to. You can become an orca whale trainer at Sea World, an Arnold Schwarzenegger im -
personator or the guy on the corner of University and 13th who flips that sign and drops it half of the time. Reach for the 
stars.

Night life in Gainesville is certainly not 
for the faint of liver. 
This large college town with an active 
Greek community and a multitude of 
eclectic clubs comes with its own set of night life procedures, from which place has what special/event/rager to the people you show up with. 
Here’s our advice for doing Gainesvegas 
the right way:
1. Pregame like no otherWhether you’re underage or a seasoned 
veteran of the night life, it never hurts to pregame. 
Think of how much money you’ll be 
saving by buying a handle of vodka than buying overpriced diluted-cranberry-and-vodka drinks at the club. 
2. Get yourself an established D.D.Gainesville cops are no joke. Don’t think 
you won’t get caught drunk driving. 
Crying won’t save you here.3. Know where to go and whenVarious nights at various places boast a 
wide array of specials, themed nights and certain crowds.
In Midtown, Balls and Salty Dog are 
tiny, cramped and all around pretty gross bars, but they are great for a cheap drink and some fratty sing-alongs. 
Gator City, which is attached to Envy, 
has 10-cent wells on Friday nights, along with other deals throughout the week, such as Karaoke night on Thursday night and ladies night Wednesday night. 
Ladies night will be your best 
friend, no matter if you are a guy or girl. 
101 Cantina has Margarita 
Mondays — enough said — and other specials each night, but don’t even try to get in with a fake I.D. — they require two forms half of the time for baby-faced freshmen. 
This new wave of students just missed 
out on late night gorge spot Munchies 420, which was right above Fat Daddy’s — known for its frozen alcoholic drinks and athlete-spotting. 
Speaking of which, Grog is a whole 
other story. I’d put money down that it is the stickiest-floored, grossest Midtown spot, but Ryan Lochte loves it. 
(Note: He is known as more of an 
eyesore to the Gainesville community now than anything. Thanks, “WWRLD?”)
And of course, visit The Swamp for 
great outdoor seating/drinking space, but that’s the extent.
The Midnight, The Bull, Tall 
Paul’s and most smaller bars and restaurants downtown are more on the hipster side and will be sure to provide an interesting drink experience.
But the clubs downtown are the total 
opposite, as 101 Downtown, famous for Techno Tuesdays, Sharab, Simon’s Nightclub, known for techno Simon’s Saturdays, and the rest of the dimly lit, sticky-floored clubs are anything but mellow. 
Spannk is best known for Neon Liger, 
the EDM-playing, eclectic Le Neon Liger dance parties usually on Saturday nights. 
Like country music? :08 has the whole 
nine yards on Thursday nights: line dancing, cowboy boots and free drinks for ladies before midnight. 
Where you go depends on the vibe you 
want, but the right place with the right music is crucial. A little online research never hurt to see what’s happening which night.
4. Follow Facebook event pages and 
promoters
There are quite a few nightlife 
promoters, including Uber Promotions and The Dynasty Group, and Facebook pages that let you know if any major events are happening and what “night” each club has each day, such as a ladies night. 
You can often times get on a “list” which 
will allow you to get into a club earlier, at a cheaper price and through a special line with fewer people. 
Better yet, make personal friends with 
a promoter. 
They see you, they get you in, problem 
solved.

THE ADAM BOMB
Although the Emmy-nominated 
“Scandal” doesn’t return to ABC un-til Oct. 3, college football can ﬁ  ll the 
void of twists and turns. 
In the summer of Manziel, controversy 
reached all the way to Archer and Uni-
versity with an alleged murder and dog barker.
College is a safe haven, but now with 
constant media attention, campuses more closely resemble a pool of piranhas. Yet, one sanctuary still exists — the football ﬁ  eld. 
With each turnstile turn, each ticket 
scan, each touchdown catch, arrest reports become passé. 
When the whistle blows on Aug. 31, it 
will be more about the orange and blue in-stead of the green and white. 
Florida faces Toledo in 17 days without 
its middle linebacker Antonio Morrison. What it will have is 15 starters returning from an 11-win season. 
More importantly, it boasts an experi-
enced quarterback, an athletic defensive line and the deepest secondary in the country.Morrison’s arrest on July 21 shows he 
should’ve been more careful (what college student would ever stay around Williston Road at 3 a.m.?). I found out about the dog-barking incident late that next day in New York City. By the time I woke up Tuesday morning, Morrison became a punch line — ironic for a linebacker who packs a serious punch.
National and local media irresponsibly 
billed him as a problem child:
A player Will Muschamp should kick 
to the curb. A player the third-year coach should send on a one-way ticket to Boling-brook, Ill. A player wasting away the gold-en ticket. Damage done. 
It’s clear for now that Morrison will be 
known more for his barking off the ﬁ  eld than for playing on it. It will be at least three weeks before he plays.
Snap judgments are a part of college 
football (hence this prediction column). 
Take Johnny Manziel. A dark cloud seems to follow the Heis-
man Trophy winner like black smoke suf-focating smokers in PSAs or “The Mon-ster” that tortured characters in “Lost.” The media and 
school are gigging Manziel to death. College, a time of development, has become a job for him (allegedly).
Every step, ev-
ery decision is scru-
tinized. It’s miserable. 
His own school newspaper, The Battal-
ion, ran a column that told him to leave in response to an angry late-night tweet from Manziel ripping College Station. Where can college football’s Justin Bieber ﬁ  nd a safe place if he can’t feel safe in his own backyard?
These players are developing on and off 
the ﬁ  eld. 
What were you doing at 20? Football players make mistakes. Some 
change programs, while all of them change lives. One bad tweet here and a miscon-ceived idea there turn into a viral feeding frenzy at the click of a button. Maybe this is all naïve, but it’s time we concentrate on the football. While Charlie Strong’s yellow Gatorade 
bath stings and stains an otherwise histor-ic season, I remember Matt Elam punching Florida into the top-ﬁ  ve with a game-sav-ing forced fumble. I remember Jeff Driskel making the Commodores defense sing the blues in Nashville and Morrison knocking out EJ Manuel as a stunned Doak Camp-bell crowd fell silent.
Expect more of the same from a Gators 
team dependent on controlling the football and the line of scrimmage. Florida should contend with Georgia and South Carolina for a spot to Atlanta.
Yet it’s too early too tell. Players like Manziel could come out of 
nowhere (Matt Jones, anybody?). If this confusing offseason has taught us any-thing, it’s that I’m not judging yet and nei-ther should you.
It’ll be a different kind of noise echoing 
in The Swamp in 17 days. 
As August turns to September, it’ll be 
time to turn the page on a summer we would all like to forget.

PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Danny Wuerffel popular-
ized it. 
Rex Grossman accom-
plished it most often in pro-
gram history. 
Tim Tebow put a stamp on 
his historic career by doing it. 
Since then, a Florida quar-
terback passing for 300 yards in a single game has occurred stunningly few times. 
Since the beginning of the 
2010 — John Brantley’s ﬁ  rst year as starting quarterback — the Gators have thrown for 300 yards in a game just once: Brantley’s 16-for-28 perfor-mance for 329 yards in a 54-32 victory against Furman on Nov. 19, 2011.
To put that in perspective, 
Grossman threw for 300 yards or more 17 times during his ca-reer. Tebow, also no stranger to eclipsing the benchmark, threw for a program-record 482 yards in his ﬁ  nal collegiate game.
Junior quarterback Jeff 
Driskel has never thrown for 300 yards in a game. His career-best came last season against Tennessee when he completed 14 of 20 passes for 219 yards. 
Second-year offensive co-
ordinator Brent Pease still be-lieves Driskel could become a consistent 300-yard passer while at UF.“He has the ability to do it,” 
Pease said. “He has the abil-ity to do it in this system. He has the ability to do it off his skills.”
If Driskel is to develop into 
the type of proliﬁ  c pass Florida became best known for during the Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer eras, a signiﬁ  cant im-provement will be required. 
Including his performance 
against Tennessee, Driskel passed for more than 200 yards just twice last season — the lone other occurrence coming a week later against Kentucky. 
In fact, 
D r i s k e l failed to pass for 
100 yards four times last sea-son — UF won each game — en route to Florida ﬁ  nishing last in the Southeastern Conference and 118th out of 124 teams nationally by averaging 146.3 passing yards per game. 
“It’s more throwing the ball 
over the top, just stretching the ﬁ  eld vertically, which we need to do,” Pease said of what must improve. “That’s route run-ning, accuracy with the ball, protection at times, and there’s a lot that becomes involved in it.”
Florida returning to its hey-
day of spreading the ﬁ  eld and taking deep shots is unlikely to return. As Pease said, “Our game is going to be wear them down up front.” 
But for the Gators to de-
velop a more balanced offense than the one that often lagged last season, creating an aerial attack will be critical. 
“We’re gonna have to hit 
more big plays,” Driskel said at UF’s media day. “We can’t run the ball 50 times a game like we did last year at points. We’re still gonna run the ball effectively … but we do have to make more plays throwing the ball.” 
The biggest key to an im-
proved passing game will be Florida’s ability to create ex-plosive plays through the air. The Gators had only 28 pass plays of 20 yards or longer last season. Twelve went 30 yards or more. 
Without Jordan Reed, whose 
athleticism made him Driskel’s favorite target, the Gators will rely on a committee of tight ends and receivers to replace his production. 
Tight end Clay Burton said 
he is conﬁ  dent with what he has seen at this point in camp.
“Watching the ﬁ  lm, the 
quarterbacks have more reads and the guys are more open be-cause of the spacing, concepts of the routes and things like that,” Burton said.

PHILIBUSTER
For anyone who is a ravenous consumer 
of sports and entertainment, the sum-mer months can be trying times. 
Baseball is in full swing, but that’s about 
it. The NBA and NHL playoffs end sometime in June, and minus a couple of mini camps that don’t really matter, the NFL is on a full hiatus. 
Television can be much the same. I’ve 
been so starved for something interesting that I have spent hours watching Big Brother 15. 
The summer is pop culture purgatory un-
til August comes and awakens the soul.
For me, I am now most interested in two 
things: How the Gators perform — because it is my job — and the ﬁ  nal half-season of “Breaking Bad,” what I believe to be the best show on television.
So as each gets going, I’ll take a look at 
three storylines entering UF’s season told through quotes from characters in “Breaking Bad.” 
“You clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think of me? No! I am the one who knocks!” — Walter White
Florida’s passing game was 
atrocious in 2012, ﬁ  nishing 114th out of 120 teams nationally. That must improve this season. 
Jeff Driskel and his receiving corps must 
be able to stretch the ﬁ  eld vertically and pose some threat to opposing defenses that will look to crowd the box and slow Matt Jones.
If Demarcus Robinson, Quinton Dunbar or 
some of Florida’s other explosive skill players can answer the call, the Gators’ offense could go from being the ones who open the door to being the ones that knocked — just as Walter did when he became the kingpin of his em-pire.
“This kicks like a mule with its balls wrapped in duct tape!” — Tuco Salamanca
After losing Matt Elam and 
Sharrif Floyd to the NFL draft, the Gators need guys to ﬁ  ll in to maintain the identity they had on defense. 
In 2012, Florida’s secondary 
was full of ball-hawking play-
makers. The defensive line had the depth to continually make life hell for opposing quar-terbacks. 
Entering this season, the depth and talent 
remain, but guys like Cody Riggs, Antonio Morrison and Leon Orr need to unleash the beasts within themselves for the UF defense to be dominant once again. 
“You are a wealthy man now. One must 
learn to be rich. To be poor, anyone can manage.” — Gus Fring
The way Walter transformed from a broke high school chemistry teacher to a conglomer-ate is the situation the Gators currently face.  
After two subpar seasons, Florida did not 
carry the target it did during the heyday of Ur-ban Meyer and Steve Spurrier. That worked well last season as the Gators ﬂ  ew under the radar for much of the season — they opened the year No. 23 in the polls — and eventu-ally won 11 games to earn a trip to the Sugar Bowl. 
The stakes are raised this year. Fans were 
offered a taste of the success they so desper-ately crave last season, and opponents were put on high alert that Florida is back. 
For as much progress as was made in Year 
Two under Will Muschamp, coming up short of Atlanta for a third consecutive year would leave a sour taste in the mouths of everyone. 
Expectations are high. How will the Gators 
respond? I believe well enough to make their ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference Championship Game since 2009.

Three factors to decide whether UF ‘breaks’ good or bad in 2013

AS STEIN ON TV
This was the summer of discontent for 
Gators fans.
Between Aaron Hernandez being 
arrested for an alleged murder, Riley Cooper saying pretty terrible things and Antonio Mor-rison getting arrested twice, Florida has been in the news for all the wrong reasons.
And things didn’t improve once camp 
started. At Southeastern Conference Media Days in July, coach Will Muschamp said the team was almost entirely healthy going into camp.
But by UF media day Aug. 1, quarterback 
Jeff Driskel had his appendix removed, run-ning back Matt Jones contracted a “serious viral infection,” starting offensive guard Jon Halapio suffered a partially torn pectoral mus-cle and lineman Max Garcia injured his back.
The injury bug didn’t stop there. Within a 
week of camp starting, redshirt senior Andre Debose and freshman Matt Rolin suffered torn ACLs.
So let the season begin. We can sit and discuss injuries, depth 
charts and projections all we want, but all the preseason hype in the world doesn’t compare to one Saturday of football.
Get out your calendars and circle some 
dates.
Thursday, Aug. 29 — the ﬁ  rst day of the 
season. Not quite the full slate of games fea-tured on Saturdays, but it will be a good night. North Carolina vs. South Carolina kicks off at 6 p.m. All it will take is one Jadeveon Clowney hit to get your juices ﬂ  owing.
Ole Miss at Vanderbilt starts right after, 
which will be a good match up of two poten-tial up-and-coming SEC teams.
And here’s the big one for most of you 
reading this column — Saturday, Aug. 31. To-ledo at Florida, the ﬁ  rst game at The Swamp in more than nine months.
The Gators’ ﬁ  rst 
game isn’t exactly a marquee matchup. Toledo ﬁ  nished third in its division in the Mid-Ameri-
can Conference last season.
But even if the opening game isn’t against 
a top out-of-conference opponent like Oklaho-ma or Notre Dame, it is still plenty exciting.
It’s the start of a new season — something 
to make everyone excited. The streets will be packed. Bars will be crowded. Trafﬁ  c will be terrible. The buzz that makes Gainesville a great place to spend a weekend will be back.
This season starts with as much optimism as any since I’ve been in Gainesville. 
I arrived in Year One A.T. — that’s After 
Tebow. The hype surrounding John Brantley revolutionizing Florida’s passing attack died quickly, as did any hopes for a national cham-pionsip.
Year Two A.T. wasn’t much better, so the 
fan base was pretty pessimistic going into 2012. 
But an 11-2 season and a Sugar Bowl ap-
pearance has people talking about Florida, and the Gators come into the season ranked No. 10 in the Coaches Poll (although that does not matter if you ask Muschamp).
But like Flavor Flav once said, don’t believe 
the hype. 
The summer is nearly over. It’s time to play 
ball.

� SLATTERY WAS A TWO-TIME 
ALL-AMERICA SELECTION.
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer
Freshman midﬁ  elder Liz Slattery 
never wanted to leave the comforts 
of Ohio.
“I was the type that didn’t want 
to go too far from home,” Slaterry said. “I was a homebody.”
The Cincinnati native said she 
planned on committing to the Uni-versity of Dayton. Then Gators as-sistant Alan Kirkup noticed her.
Slattery, 18, played in a tourna-
ment at Walt Disney World in Or-lando before the end of her senior year of high school. Kirkup attended to watch an opposing player, Slat-tery said.
“He saw me get hit or knocked 
down, and I lost the ball, and I guess I just started smiling and laughing,” she said. 
“He remembered seeing me do 
that and loved that I smiled after I got hit. I think he saw my potential, and l think that is what he loved most about me.”  When the time came to meet 
coach Becky Burleigh and visit the UF campus, Slattery said the choice was obvious.
“I knew right when I came and 
talked to Becky, saw the school and saw [the team] play on top of every-thing, I was like, ‘This is where I’ve got to be. I can’t pass this opportu-nity up,’” she said.Slattery made a smooth transi-
tion to Gainesville despite having to leave her family behind.
“The girls here are so awesome, 
and they make you feel so at home that it helps keep my mind off things,” she said.
Slattery joins a roster of 27 play-
ers, coming in with numerous ac-colades from high school and club soccer. 
She was a back-to-back NSCAA 
High School All-America selection at midﬁ  eld for 2011 and 2012, ﬁ  nished her high school career with 66 goals and 36 assists and led the Cincinnati United Premier Crew Jr. Gold 94/95 club team in the 2011-2012 season with 13 goals.
Even with her offensive experi-
ence, Slattery said she sees her role on the team as a defensive center-mid.
“You have to have a lot of com-
posure and you have to stay strong to your role,” Slattery said. 
“You’re going to get the ball to 
people who will make something happen in the attacking third on the ﬁ  eld. That is one of the biggest things, not losing your role and try-ing to do everything.”

FIRE JOE MORGAN
Wide receivers coach Joker Phillips 
is a Photoshop wizard, and of-fensive coordinator Brent Pease 
proved quick-witted when it came to Jeff Driskel’s boredom.
Even coach Will Muschamp became 
involved, jokingly bemoaning our genera-tion’s beloved hashtag and insisting we call it “a number sign.”
So why wouldn’t Twitter maintain its 
stronghold on Florida football during the season?
As Muschamp’s 105 characters aim 
to build on a stellar 11-2 record in 2012, here’s what I see trending for UF this year. Naturally, each is preceded by a hash - uh, number sign.
#Violators — Perhaps the opposition 
should get a better grip on the football this year. Turnover margin was a key compo-nent in Florida’s resurgence last season. I expect plenty of ball hawking by the Gators in 2013.
#OOMF — The sound football players 
make when they hit each other. Wait, that means something else? What did one of my followers do?
#Driskel&Ebert — Unless 
he kept his football talent in his appendix, I believe Driskel will earn #twothumbsup in 2013. Added experience, increased familiarity with Pease’s offensive scheme and the lack of a quarterback competition will help him step into the leadership role the Gators need him to ﬁ  ll.
#MurphysLaw — Florida should assign 
a Secret Service detail to protect Driskel. Like his rogue ex-appendix, danger pops up when you least expect it. With all due respect to Tyler Murphy, Driskel is the Gators’ lone viable starting quarterback. If Driskel gets hurt, Muschamp can’t simply shut off his Xbox like the rest of us.
#BieberFever — When is Justin Bieber 
not trending on Twitter? It’s inevitable.
#NeedForReed — Who can replace the departed Jordan Reed? The blocking will be OK, but if none emerge as half the pass-catcher Reed was last year, that would spell trouble even for Peyton Manning because…
#PleaseCatchSomething 
— Returning wide receivers 
not named Quinton Dunbar combined for eight catches and 44 yards last season. One of those guys, Andre Debose, is done for the season with a torn ACL. Talented freshman Demarcus Robinson is the wild card. Can he step in and produce from Day 1? I think so.
#NoFlyZone — Florida’s secondary 
is one of the best in the country even af-ter losing Matt Elam and Josh Evans. I can merely say names to prove my point. Loucheiz Purifoy. Marcus Roberson. Jay-len Watkins. Vernon Hargreaves III.
#1000K — Matt Jones will become the 
ninth Gator to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Recovering from his recent illness may take some time, but I expect Jones to hit the ground running. Once he settles back in, he will be a game-changer.
#ItsAlmostAsGreatUF — The Gators 
will win fewer games this season than last, but they will be a better team. Excluding the loss to Georgia, seemingly every break went Florida’s way in 2012. The Gators will make it through the nation’s toughest schedule with eight or nine wins and a Jan. 1 bowl berth.
#HotAsHell — Two noon kickoffs in 
the Florida heat to begin the season? Must be nice for those insane ESPN executives to make decisions like that from the com-fort of air-conditioned conference rooms. 
#CoachBoom — Should we expect any-
thing different than Muschamp’s trade-mark passion on the sidelines? Look for-ward to another season of Muschamp emotions ripe for GIFs and memes. Never change, Your Boomness, never change.

Florida had several established 
upperclassmen to lead the defense 
in 2012. 
Matt Elam was already one of the 
top safeties in the nation, and Josh Evans had cemented himself at the free safety position.
But this season, Florida is look-
ing to another defender to step up to fill that role — cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy.
 “Leadership wise, I’ve devel-
oped a lot,” Purifoy said. “I’m talk-ing more from last year.”
Florida remains deep at the cor-
nerback position. Besides Purifoy, the Gators return junior Marcus Roberson and senior Jaylen Watkins. Roberson and Watkins combined for five interceptions in 2012.
Purifoy has seen his stock rise be-
fore this season, and he thinks he’s going to be better than he was last year.
“Keeping my hands up,” Purifoy 
said when asked about how he’s im-proved. “Finishing tackles … Other than that I’m good.”
But the Gators’ weak spot in the 
secondary is at safety, where they need to replace Elam and Evans. 
Muschamp moved junior corner-
back Cody Riggs to safety to help fill the hole. Riggs played in only two games in 2012 before sitting out the rest of the season with a fractured foot.
“It was very frustrating because 
I didn’t even know how I fractured my foot,” Riggs said. “It was just in the middle of the game, I told them something was wrong and then come to find out my foot was bro-ken.
“It was kind of heartbreaking, 
because we were having such a good season and I had to sit back and watch.”
Muschamp thinks Riggs will be 
able to improve pass coverage while playing at safety. 
Riggs has big shoes to fill — Elam 
and Evans combined for seven inter-ceptions last season.
“You need to be able to have a guy that can cover in the slot and cover and play man-to-man,” Mus-champ said. “And he does that well.”
Said Riggs: “I’ve worked on cov-
ering in the slot better, I’ve worked on just playing safety, watching Matt and Josh on film. I think I’ve stepped my game up a lot.”
Purifoy thinks Florida will have 
no problem finding players to step up to replace Elam and Evans. The Gators brought in several highly touted recruits to add to the second-ary, including Vernon Hargreaves III, the top cornerback in the coun-try, according to Rivals.com.
“[Vernon] came in smart,” Puri-
foy said. “He knows a lot. He’s got a good technique … You can tell he put the work in when he wasn’t here.
“He can get his hands on the ball, 
he got a knack for it.”
And at safety, Florida brought 
in four-star recruits Marcell Harris, Keanu Neal and Nick Washington.

WHAT TO EXPECT
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer
It may be August — and football is the 
dominant sport here in Gainesville — but 
college basketball season is approaching sooner than you think.
Thanks to new NCAA legislation, teams 
can now hold 30 practices during a 42-day span before the start of the regular season in mid-November. 
With the Gators’ training camp set to be-
gin about two weeks earlier than it would in the past, expect practices to possibly start in late September. 
Since Florida’s Elite Eight exit on March 
31, the Gators’ offseason has been clouded with uncertainty. 
Here are six questions about UF yet to be 
answered as it approaches the regular season in about two and a half months:
1. Will Chris Walker and Eli Carter be 
cleared to play? 
The Gators are still awaiting the NCAA 
Clearinghouse’s ruling on Walker, who is dealing with academic eligibility issues. 
Walker, the No. 6 recruit in Rivals.com’s 
rankings for the Class of 2013, would put the Gators over the top. His pe-rimeter skills and ball handling still need work, but the Bonifay native would add plenty of ath-leticism and shot-blocking to the Gators’ frontcourt if he is ruled eligible. 
Donovan is also awaiting 
word on Carter’s eligibility for the 2013-14 season, but the Rut-gers transfer guard’s chances to play this sea-son looks brighter than Walker’s hopes.  
Following the mess Mike Rice left at Rut-
gers after allegedly verbally and physically abusing his players, Carter is hoping to re-ceive clearance from Rutgers and a waiver from the NCAA that would allow him to play for the Gators next year. 
Two weeks ago, Rutgers transfer guard 
Mike Poole was granted immediate NCAA eligibility to play at Iona, so Carter’s situa-tion looks promising. 
Carter, who played two seasons at Rut-
gers and averaged 14.3 points in 56 games, would solidify the Gators’ young backcourt — especially with starting point guard Scot-tie Wilbekin’s status in limbo. 
2. Will Wilbekin rejoin the team?  Donovan suspended Wil-
bekin indeﬁ  nitely on June 10 for violating team rules. At the be-ginning of the 2012-13 season, Wilbekin was also suspended for breaking a team rule.
Donovan said last month 
that he would meet with Wil-bekin once the fall semester starts and “go from there.” The 
Florida coach could eventually reinstate Wil-bekin like he did with Erik Murphy back in 2011 ﬁ  ve months after the forward’s alleged car break-in. 
Not having Wilbekin would be a blow to 
UF’s defense, which was ranked third in the country in adjusted efﬁ  ciency, according to KenPom.com. 
3. Will Kasey Hill emerge as a ﬂ  oor lead-
er for the Gators?  
A 6-foot-1, ﬁ  ve-star recruit, Hill has the 
potential to be a lottery pick if he lives up to his billing. Donovan should love Hill’s style of play this year as he thrives as a distributor in the open court. 
Senior center Patric Young (and maybe 
Walker) could see plenty of lob passes down their way from Hill.4. Will Young step up to the plate?  
In an up-and-down junior season, Young 
averaged 10.1 points but only 6.3 rebounds per contest. The 6-foot-9, 240-pound Young has recorded consecutive games with dou-ble-digit rebounds only twice in his college career – both times during his sophomore season. 
With Kenny Boynton, Mike Rosario and 
Murphy — 50.5 percent of last year’s offense — gone, Young might need to be Florida’s offensive anchor. 
An injured right ankle could have fac-
tored into Young’s inconsistent production last season, but he needs to prove more reli-able on both ends of the ﬂ  oor in 2013-14 if he wants to be a ﬁ  rst-round pick in next year’s NBA Draft. 
5. Will the Gators win a close game this 
year?  
Florida was 0-6 in games decided by 
single digits last season. The most notable of those closes losses was a 66-63 defeat to Ole Miss in the SEC Tournament ﬁ  nal.

Coming off a successful 2012-13 season, 
the Florida swim team is built for a repeat 
performance this year.
After winning the men’s Southeast-
ern Conference title for the ﬁ  rst time in 20 years and placing sixth at the NCAA Championships in March, Florida lost three swimmers to graduation. Although one is a former Olympian and two were 2013 All-Americans, some of the most dominant swimmers will still compete this season.
The other 26 athletes totaled one na-
tional championship, 34 All-American selections and ﬁ  ve conference champion-ships while setting four school records last season.
Two-time South African Olympian 
Sebastien Rousseau, who is coming off four U.S. Open Championships titles this summer; Brad deBorde, the UF record holder in the 50 Free (19.12); and 2012 Pol-ish Olympian Marcin Cieslak, who placed second in three events at the 2013 NCAA Championships while setting two UF re-cords, all return to the Gators.
The women’s team ﬁ  nished third in 
the SEC Championships and matched the men’s sixth-place ﬁ  nish at the NCAA Championships. They graduate four se-niors, but two missed the majority of the 2012-13 season. 
Three years removed from winning the 
women’s NCAA championships in 2010, Florida looks to make a title run with two-time U.S. Olympian Elizabeth Beisel enter-ing her senior year. 
She notched two NCAA champion-
ships, set a new school record in the 200-yard individual medley (1:54.39) and won ﬁ  ve All-America honors last season.
She isn’t the 
only threat in the water.
Two Olym-
pians, as well as nine 2013 All-Americans who earned 29 All-American selections, will join the Gators.
Florida will have to go through four-
time defending conference champion and 2013 national champion Georgia to claim a championship.
Florida has competed against them in 
each of the past 10 seasons and only won once.
“The SEC is the best conference,” coach 
Gregg Troy said in a release. “You know you are going to a get a great shot in every chance that you swim them.”UF swimming adds pair of Olympians in pursuit of championship
