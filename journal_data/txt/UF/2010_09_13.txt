Winona Public Library were thrilled this 
week when someone returned a book that had been checked out some 35 years ago. 
The book is called “Small Voices: A 
Grownup’s Treasury of Selections from the Diaries, Journals and Notebooks of Young Children.” 
It’s a collection of journal entries that 
prominent public figures had written as children. Someone left it in the library’s drop-box as part of the its Amnesty Week for overdue books.
Reference librarian Robin DeVries said 
she’s thrilled to get it back.
Records suggest it was checked out in 
the early 1970s. But because the circulation system has since changed, it’s not clear who last checked it out.

For about two-and-a-half quarters 
against USF, Florida looked every bit as 
vulnerable as it did in its season opener.
Then, Jeff Demps popped the pressure 
bubble.
With the game tied midway through the 
third quarter, the junior running back took 
a handoff around the left side, leapt over a fallen defender at the line of scrimmage and dashed down the sideline, breaking a tackle before following two blockers into 
the end zone.
On a tense, sweltering afternoon inside 
The Swamp, Demps’ 62-yard run provided 
the next-best relief to a cold towel and tall 
glass of sweet tea. 
It was the big blow in his career-high 
139-yard performance, kicking off a 
31-point second half that turned a nail-biter into the No. 10 Gators’ 38-14 win in 
front of 90,612.
“I think everyone knows how I feel 
about Demps,” UF coach Urban Meyer 
said. “I know how the offensive line feels 
about Demps. You give him a crack and 
that guy’s gone.”
The Gators (2-0) racked up 251 rushing 
yards to go along with quarterback John 
Brantley’s 172 yards and two touchdowns on 18-of-31 passing, with the bulk of the 
production coming in the second half.
Before the half, Florida managed just 42 rushing yards on 11 carries, losing the total yardage battle 162-157 and failing to score 
until Carl Moore’s 11-yard touchdown grab with 0:44 left.
The offense opened the contest in a 
groan-inducing fashion reminiscent of last 
week’s error-filled victory against Miami (Ohio).
Demps brought the opening kickoff out 
to the 43-yard line, but the Gators couldn’t capitalize on the field position.
Brantley was hit as he threw on the first 
play, and on 3rd-and-6, he dropped the shotgun snap before hitting umpire John-
ny Hibbett with his pass.
The first three drives ended in punts, 
then kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a 39-
yard field goal. Meanwhile, the Bulls (1-
1) pieced together a 96-yard touchdown 
drive to take a 7-0 lead on their first pos-session.
The deficit marked the second straight 
game in which UF has trailed after the first 
quarter, a feat not seen in back-to-back 
home games in more than a dozen years.
In need of a momentum change, the 
Gators turned to their most reliable play-
makers — the secondary.
With a little more than a minute left, 
safety Ahmad Black picked off USF quar -
terback B.J. Daniels to set up a short touch-
down drive, the first of four interceptions 
that led to 21 points. 
Black added another pick on the Bulls’ 
next drive, defensive end Justin Trattou re-Gators head into conference play on right foot

� THE INTERFAITH FORUM 
SOUGHT TO UNIFY CITY.

The Dove World Outreach Cen-
ter’s threat to burn the Quran gained 
worldwide attention, but amid the 
threats of violence and media chaos in Gainesville, one organization held tightly to its founding principles of peace, understanding and hope — the Gainesville Interfaith Forum. 
The organization hosted the Gath-
ering for Peace, Understanding & Hope this Friday at the Trinity United 
Methodist Church and greeted more 
than one thousand visitors with speakers, art galleries, music and food representing the traditions of 
various faiths.
The event was held to encourag-
ing tolerance and love in both the reli-
gious and international communities.

Eight-year-old Rebecca carried a white 
cutout of the word peace while marching 
to protest the Dove World Outreach Center on Saturday.
Nine years earlier, her father, Albert 
Meyer, was in the World Trade Center’s Sbarro’s pizza restaurant when he heard what he thought was a gunshot.
Meyer walked outside to see what 
caused the noise and looked up to find a jet sticking out of the first tower.
About four years ago, Meyer and his 
wife, Marivic, decided they wanted to move out of New Jersey to raise their chil-dren somewhere else.Protestors demonstrate,

UF professor Julie Johnson received about $10 million to find a way 
to customize a patient’s blood pressure medicine based genes.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF researcher received 
about a $10 million grant to study 
the relationship between a per -
son’s genetic code and the effec-
tiveness of high blood pressure medications.
Julie Johnson, chair of phar -
macotherapy and translational research in the College of Phar -
macy, is the leader of one of 14 re-search groups that received fund-
ing from The National Institutes 
of Health as part of the National 
Pharmacogenomics Research 
Network.Rochelle Long, director of the 
Pharmacogenomics Research Network, said  Johnson received 
the funding because of the signif-
icance of high blood pressure and the drugs she is testing.
Long said that the selection 
process is competitive, but John-son had the most meritorious ap-
plication.
The funding will be used to 
pay for five years of research, in-
cluding a clinical trial, lab work 
and statistical work, Johnson 
said. 
“It’s thought that in the next 
decade more people will have their genetic code in their medi-
cal record,” she said.
She said treating a patient’s 
high blood pressure quickly is 
important in preventing heart at-
tacks and strokes.
“Even getting blood pressure 
controlled one or two months 
quicker leads to better outcomes two, three years down the road,” 
Johnson said.Professor receives $10M grant

In the culmination of a week-long, na-
tional commemoration of Sept. 11, the 9/11: 
Never Forget Project hosted a candlelight vigil to mark the ninth anniversary of the 
tragedy.
The memorial was sponsored by the UF 
College Republicans, Americans for Pros-perity and the Network of Enlightened Women.
About 50 people gathered next to the 
cluster of more than 2,977 American flags on the grass of the Plaza of the Americas, holding white candles and listening to commemorative songs and prayers.
Carly Wilson, chairwoman for the UF 
College Republicans, said this was the first time the Sept. 11 
anniversary has fallen on a 
game day.
“People were saying that the memorial 
was infringing on their ability to tailgate,” she said. “I am so grateful that we still have people here to remember.”
Sophomore Stacey LaSala read a prayer 
she wrote, recognizing the victims of Sept. 11.
“The thoughts that inspired me were

Members of Students for a Democratic Society protest across the street from Dove World Out -
reach Center on Friday. They chanted, “Two, Four, Six, Eight, we don’t want your racist hate.”
More than 300 protestors marched from park to church carrying signs
“We picked Gainesville specifically because of its reli-
gious and ethnic tolerance,” he said, adding he is an athe-
ist who was raised Jewish and that his wife is from the 
Philippines.
 “What’s happening now is not Gainesville.”
More than 300 protesters agreed with Meyer when 
they marched half a mile from Possum Creek State Park 
to the church.
They wanted to protest what they called Dove’s pro-
motion of bigotry, hate and Islamophobia.
The protesters carried signs promoting peace and love 
and chanted, “No burning, no hate. Not our city, not our state.”
Joe Richard, an organizer for the International Social-
ist Organization, said they started planning the protest 
shortly after Pastor Terry Jones announced “International Burn a Koran Day” in mid-July.Jones canceled the burning to fly to New York in an ef-
fort to negotiate the moving of Park 51, an Islamic cultural 
center in downtown Manhattan. 
Had the church followed through on its plan to burn 
copies of the Quran on Saturday night, Richard said there 
would have been more than 1,000 protesters, including 
people from New York and Chicago who would have 
come on buses.
While marching, Meyer was thinking about the posi-
tive effects of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
“After 9/11, people of all religions banded together. 
People who didn’t talk for 25 years hugged. Everyone helped each other. It was solidarity. That is the spirit of 9/11,”  he said.  “What Mr. Jones is doing is just the op-posite.”PROTEST , from page 1LOCAL

Although the Dove World Ourtreach 
Center Quran burning was canceled, mem-
bers of the Gainesville community still came 
together to stand against intolerance Satur -
day.
Four hundred people gathered at the 
Bo Diddley Community Plaza for a Day of 
Peace and Unity, hosted by the Gainesville 
Muslim Initiative.“We want to continue doing positive 
things for the community,” said Karim Khan, Project Downtown Gainesville out-reach coordinator. 
“Even though [Terry Jones is] not burn-
ing books, we’re still out here.”
The activities continued through sunset, 
including a call to prayer and a rendition of 
“The Star Spangled Banner” played on the 
oud, a Middle Eastern instrument.
“My message is to congratulate the city 
for coming together around things we all have in common,” said Russell Meyer, ex-ecutive director of the Florida Council of 
Churches said. “The future lies along the way of peace 
and respect. I’m very 
proud of what Gainesville has done to express their common love and hope for 
humanity.” 
After the speeches, the 
crowd held a moment of 
silence for the victims of Sept. 11. At a press conference Friday, Ismail ibn 
Ali, president of Islam on Campus at UF, announced that even though Jones had canceled the Quran burning, the group still 
intended to go ahead with all events it had 
planned in response, including Quran 101, a public discussion of the Islamic holy book. 
“We have the same hopes and dreams as 
everyone else, and we want to establish re-lationships and connections with our neigh-bors who enjoy good and repel evil,” said Ali.Community gathers downtown to fight intolerance

side High School in Gainesville, explained why she was moved to participate in the Gainesville Inter -
faith Forum.
“I feel with the increasing Is-
lamophobia, we need to get out there,” she said. “We need to show 
each other what our religions are 
about.”
Dan Johnson, senior pastor of 
Trinity United Methodist Church and fellow member of the Inter -
faith Forum, started the initiative for the event. The event has expanded beyond 
the Gainesville community, elicit-
ing donations from all over the 
country and support from around the world. 
“I received e-mail affirmation 
from all over the world,” Johnson explained, noting an e-mail from a woman in Pakistan who “thanked God” for his church. “People are so bombarded by this Dove stuff, 
they are eager to find anything else 
[positive].”
Amanda Monaco, UF junior and 
president of Humanitarian Interac-
tion on Campus, agreed with the positive response of the Gainesville 
Interfaith Forum to the Dove World 
Outreach Center. 
“[The Gathering for Peace, Un-
derstanding & Hope] is a perfect 
response to the hateful thing Dove 
was doing,” she said. “Instead of respond-ing in an antagonistic way, we made it into 
a positive experience.”
At the event, a wide arrange of 
cultures were represented. From saris to yarmulkes, from naan to challah bread, no ethnic stone was 
left unturned.  Josh Pusey, the youth director at 
Trinity United Methodist Church, said, “It is a testament to our com-
munity. We are a people committed to the idea of living in harmony.”
Asad and Humeraa Qamar, 
husband and wife and founders of both the Ocala and Gainesville interfaith forums, created the orga-nizations in response to the wear -
ing of the “Islam Is of The Devil” 
T-shirts by members of the Dove 
World Outreach Center about a year ago. 
The forum is composed of mem-
bers from the Hindu, Muslim, Jew-ish and Christian faiths.
“The group meets together, 
holds hands and prays together,” Humeraa Qamar said. “[They are] outstanding individuals who make the effort to promote love and 
peace.”
The group meets every three 
months and discusses topics of 
mutual interest, seeking to find similarities and common ground.
She said the mission of the 
group is “to foster love, peace and understanding between different faiths, recognizing faiths are differ -
ent yet alike.”

MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5
� ALEX SINK HAD TO CANCEL.
By HANNAH WINSTON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF College Democrats and College 
Republicans both held tailgates with a pur -
pose before Saturday’s football game.
The Democrats tailgated under a blue 
tent near Library East to help campaign for 
candidates. 
Originally, Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Alex Sink was scheduled to make 
an appearance and join in the pre-game 
festivities, but she had to cancel at the last 
minute. 
Erin Murphy, vice president of the Col-
lege Democrats, said she is sure Sink’s cam-
paign will stop at UF before the Nov. 2 elec-
tion. 
Voters met two other candidates at the tailgate instead. 
Jon Paugh, a candidate for Florida House 
of Representatives District 22 is only 27 
years old but said he wants to make a differ -
ence in the state.
“I have three boys, and what I witnessed 
as a teacher teaching economics, and see-
ing how Florida operates made me decide 
I wanted to bring the right policies to Flor -
ida.”
Perry McGriff Jr.,  73, who is running 
against Sen. Steven Oelrich for State Senate 
District 14, which encompass 8 counties and 
includes all of Alachua County, also went to the tailgate. 
After graduating from UF and playing 
football and baseball for the Gators in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s, he stayed close 
to Gainesville. McGriff served as mayor, Chairman of the Alachua County Commis-
sion and remains a season ticket holder for 
Gator football. Scott Maddox, the Democratic candidate 
for commissioner of agriculture and con-
sumer services, was also supposed to be at the tailgate but got stuck in traffic. 
However, he did make it to the game but 
left immediately after to start a 12-day bus tour of South Florida. 
In a phone interview, he said the best 
thing he can do for college students is make sure there are jobs for them when they grad-uate, which he hopes to accomplish by cre-ating green jobs in Florida.
Not far away from the 
Democrats, the UF College Re-publicans competed for party exposure at their own tailgate. 
Keith Perry, Jon Paugh’s opponent in 
District 22, was there, and signs for other republican candidates created a border around the tailgate tent.
But in addition to campaigning, the Re-
publicans were also there to guard the 2,977 flags of the 9/11: Never Forget Project on the south side of the Plaza of the Americas. 
Carly Wilson, chairwoman of the Col-
lege Republicans, said one tailgater tried to put a satellite in the center of the memorial, between the nine and the eleven, which are spelled out in flags. She said he complained when the College Republicans asked him to move the satellite. 
She said many fans were frustrated that 
they couldn’t use the space to tailgate, but hundreds of UF and USF fans passed by the Sept. 11  memorial, stopped in reflection and asked for 9/11: Never Forget pins. 
“It’s a reflection of what we do here,” 
Wilson said. 
Wilson said the USF College Republicans 
were supposed to join the UF Republicans. None of them were able to buy tickets, so they didn’t make it to Gainesville. Plus, she added, “they didn’t want to see their team be slaughtered up here.”Political candidates tailgate with student groups

media look absolutely foolish. 
I want to address all the misconceptions about this cen-
ter. There are so many wrong generalizations and criticisms of Park 51 that I don’t even know where to begin, but why don’t we start with its name. 
So many critics and members of the media continue 
to incorrectly refer to this building as the “Ground Zero Mosque.” 
Is it at ground zero? No. In fact, you can’t even see it 
from ground zero. 
Is it a mosque? No. It has been made very clear that 
while the building will have a prayer space, it will not be a mosque. There is a difference. The Park 51 leaders have 
noted if it is a mosque, any member of the faith must be 
allowed in, regardless of ideology. However, if it is con-
sidered a prayer space, leaders can control who is let in. Essentially, because it is not a mosque, leaders can stop terrorists from coming in and using the center. Let’s stop referring to it as the “Ground Zero Mosque” and recognize its official name as Park 51.
So many of the critics have an us-versus- them mental-
ity and claim that building this center is a triumph for the terrorists who attacked the United States nine years ago. Those people would also be wrong. This is an Islamic cen-ter for Islamic Americans. Connecting an entire religion with one international terrorist organization is nothing short of nonsense. 
While it has a small area for prayer, the majority of the 
building will be home to community-involvement areas, including an auditorium, performing arts center, fitness center, swimming pool, child care area, bookstore, culinary school and an art studio.
The center would be a place for 
people of a particular faith to come together, similar to the YMCA and Jewish Community Centers. 
Critics also have said building 
this center is insensitive to families of those lost on Sept. 11. But again, the center is not being built for terrorists 
but for American citizens. In fact, many family members of Sept. 11 victims have come out in support of Park 51 for 
that very reason. To really hammer home the point, this 
center will actually have a Sept. 11 memorial inside. 
The brain behind the center, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, is 
an activist who has worked to improve the relationship be-
tween the Muslim world and the United States for years. 
Rauf condemned the actions of the terrorists and said 
terrorism has no place in Islam. 
This is exactly the type of person who could help im-
prove relations between Americans of all religions and re-mind us that at the end of the day, regardless of religion, we are all Americans. 
Even if you don’t support the location of the center, you 
have to respect the decision and recognize that the group has a right to build it. 
The First Amendment gives everyone the right to free-
dom of religion and, as such,  there is no basis at all to stop the building of this center. 
This is an opportunity to come out in support of coop-
eration and civility between people of all faiths.
Instead, some people are choosing to turn it into one 
more example of American ignorance.

Locals showed sense 
of community
The circus came to town this week. 
And the circus performed of its own accord with 
its own rules in its three frenzied rings. 
As Gainesville took the international spotlight for one 
of its churches’ planned-then-suspended-then-canceled 
Quran burning, the media swarmed to our tiny town in north-central Florida like moths to flame. 
And as front-page sightings of the pastor began to 
dwindle as the story-to-beat-all-stories fizzled, the circus just wouldn’t let go. 
This story was too good to die. On Saturday morning, Gainesville returned to normal-
cy with the announcement that the Quran burning was canceled and that Pastor Terry Jones had flown to New York City. 
The Swamp’s orange-and-blue-bathed crowd was re-
born, and the Dove World Outreach Center was surpris-ingly quiet.
But the media waited for something — for anything. The sound of news vans idling, carrying satellites larg-
er than the Dove Center’s entrance marquee, filled the air 
as the front yard of the church started to look like an RV 
campground.
And that’s because this was the story that became the 
story, and the storytellers became the characters. We’re 
sorry it came to that, Gators. 
As the publication that not-so-officially represents 
the university that lies within the same city limits as the 
church that has caught the international spotlight for its hateful messages, we’ve been overwhelmed by the media 
knocking on our doors and camping in our town. 
But Saturday afternoon, as news began to fizzle and 
stories began to die, the people became the story.
And we’re glad because that’s the real Gainesville. This 
was the Gainesville the world needed to know. 
Students for a Democratic Society marched in droves to 
the center to send a message of peace. 
Floridians and citizens from across the country joined 
to see church on a narrow two-lane road and tell the world what they wanted most: peace. 
Heck, even People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
was there, talking about veganism’s correlations with a 
peaceful world.
We’ve come a long way during these past weeks, 
Gators. 
Members of our community have received death 
threats, and our police were forced to set up a rumor-con-trol hotline to dispel lies and enforce the truth. 
UF had to ensure the safety of its students, as parents 
and students alike shared concerns about potential vio-lence at Saturday’s football game. 
Religions were tainted, and there’s no repairing that. 
Ultimately, the damage has already been done. 
As Gators and Gainesville residents took time out of 
their Saturday to stand outside the church with an ironic peace-invoking name to promote their own messages of 
acceptance and welcoming with handmade signs, we were 
finally able to see what Gainesville wants the world to know.
Gainesville deserves its time in the sun, not in the shad-
ows.

Inter-Residence Hall Association 
misusing students’ funds
I am sad to report that on-campus 
residents have been dealt a great injus-
tice by their voice within the residence 
halls, the Inter-Residence Hall Associa-
tion. 
The IRHA was created with the in-
tention of providing service for the on-
campus community.
But it has started a precedent of self-
ish and unethical spending that will ul-
timately hurt your on-campus college experience. 
It is only fair that the approximate 
7,000 on-campus residents understand what their leaders are doing with the funds that were appropriated for the 
residents’ entertainment and personal 
development.
This trail of selfishness and poor eth-
ics began last year with the purchase of a $2,000 conference table for the IRHA 
workshop/office. 
This table, I can assure you, was never and, never will be, intended for 
the residents — a  notion that is in clear violation of the organization’s founding documents. 
This theme continued at the Sept. 7 
IRHA general body meeting.
Many of the representatives at the 
meeting reached a new low when they  
allocated hundreds of residents’ dol-
lars in order to fund “IRHA’s Camping Trip,” the housing equivalent of a Greek woodser.
Take note that this trip was not de-
signed to be an IRHA business retreat or an event dedicated to the residents. 
No, this vacation was designed for 
50 privileged friends many of whom 
openly take pleasure in robbing you of 
the money necessary to fund your pro-grams.
As disgusted as I am to be writing 
this about my own organization, you 
should feel even sicker. Point blank,you 
are being robbed.

Ahmad Black11 caries, 139 yards, 1 TD; 1 catch, 21 yards; 2 kick returns, 95 yards
Urban Meyer said after Saturday’s game the Gators are starting to ﬁ  nd their offensive identity. And if that’s the case, expect the coaches to build game plans around Demps for the rest of the season. If he gets a glimpse of open ﬁ  eld, all bets are off, as evidenced by his game-changing 62-yard touchdown in the third quarter. South Florida showed it was poised to stay in the game with a 69-yard drive later in the quarter, but Demps killed any thought of a comeback with a 54-yard kickoff return to set up a ﬁ  eld goal.
1 tackle for loss; 1 interception; 1 punt return, 30 yardsJenkins’ numbers don’t suggest he had too busy a game Saturday, but for defensive backs that can be a good thing. Of Bulls quarterback B.J. Daniels’ ﬁ  ve completions, only one went to a receiver defended by Jenkins. And of the two times Jenkins did make notable plays, both gave the Gators’ offense a short ﬁ  eld to work with and led to touchdowns. His dynamic 30-yard punt return could also earn him the full-time job after running back Chris Rainey struggled on special teams in the ﬁ  rst half.SWAMP STUDS

8 tackles; 2 interceptions.
With a defense featuring two second-year linebackers, Black has served as the unit’s lifesaver, leading the team in tackles for the second straight week. Some of those tackles came as a result of poor pass defense, as three of Daniels’ ﬁ  ve completions were directed at receivers guarded by Black. And his misjudgment of a deep post pass led to a 51-yard gain, by far the most productive play for the Bulls. But he compensated for those lapses with a pair of interceptions, although we still aren’t too impressed with that diving catch at the end of the half on a throw to no one in particular. Way to pad those stats, Ahmad.
With Florida down 7-0 late in the second quarter, safety Ahmad Black intercepted a pass that USF quarterback B.J. 
Daniels threw on the run. The interception was Black’s ﬁ  rst of two in the game. The pick helped set UF up for a touchdown to tie the game just seconds before halftime.TURNING POINT1234Final

turned one 35 yards for a score in the third 
quarter, and Janoris Jenkins notched his sec-ond of the year in the ﬁ  nal frame.
  “The thing we went into this game with 
was to let [Daniels] try to beat us running the ball,” Black said. “We knew for a fact he wasn’t going to beat us throwing the ball. If 
he put the ball in the air, it was ours.”
  And just as importantly, the Gators didn’t 
give it back. 
A week after fumbling three times, they 
kept a clean sheet in the turnover depart-ment.
  And after Demps’ big run, the offense’s 
wheels found some traction.
  Florida leaned on its offen-
sive line and stable of running 
backs to surge ahead and burn the clock. Meyer called it “blue collar,” and the result was 209 second-half rushing yards.
  That made life easier on Brantley when 
his number was called. He threw the ball just nine times after the half, completing six and connecting on a play-action pass to tight end 
Jordan Reed for a two-yard touchdown, the 
game’s ﬁ  nal score.
  It wasn’t as clean a performance as Brant-
ley or Meyer would have liked to see head-ing into Southeastern Conference play next 
weekend at Tennessee, but Meyer said the of-
fense’s identity is starting to take shape.
  “That’s kind of what we want to be: a very 
physical offense that has backs who run real 
hard and a quarterback that can throw it in 
there with receivers making plays,” Meyer said. “You started to see that in the second half. It’s a little more traditional than we’re used to.” UF did not com-
mit a turnover

 Less than 24 hours after 15 service errors cost Florida 
a chance to beat No. 1 Penn State, a pair of service aces 
brought them a measure of redemption.
  With No. 4 Florida’s (6-1) match against No. 5 Texas 
(5-3) tied 14-14 in the ﬁ  fth set, Gators freshman Chanel Brown stepped up and delivered back-to-back aces, lifting her team to a 3-2 (25-11, 27-25, 16-25, 20-25, 16-14) victory 
in its ﬁ  nal match of the Nike Volleyball Big Four Classic 
on Saturday in the O’Connell Center.
  “I just came out like it was any other serve,” Brown 
said. “I came out calm and relaxed because we’re so team-oriented, and I knew we had each other’s backs the whole 
way through.” 
  Brown led the way with four aces as the team recorded 
a season-high nine, providing the offense with a vital lift in a match where it hit just .159. 
  Florida’s attack seemed lifeless and uncoordinated for 
large portions of the contest, but it was saved by strong serving and blocking, as the Gators recorded double-digit 
blocks (11) for the ﬁ  fth time this season.
  “Our communication was deﬁ  nitely down and I think 
our energy was down,” said junior Kelly Murphy, who recorded her 17th career triple-double Friday against the 
Nittany Lions. “Texas deﬁ  nitely got in a rhythm and set 
us back on our heels a little bit.”
  The match didn’t start out that way, however, as the 
Gators stormed to a 25-11 ﬁ  rst-set win. 
  The Longhorns hit negative-.125 in the opening game, 
recording just six kills compared to nine errors thanks partly to Florida’s two blocks and three aces. 
  But Texas would steadily improve its attack from there, 
increasing its hitting percentage by at least .100 in each of the next three sets. 
  “In sets three and four, (Texas) got into a very good 
rhythm and were getting ﬁ  rst swing kills at a high per-centage,” UF coach Mary Wise said. 
  In those two sets, the Longhorns hit a combined .391 
and outscored the Gators 50-36. 
  Texas’ offensive emergence corresponded with Flori-
da’s offensive decline, as the Gators hit a combined .119 in the third and fourth sets after hitting a combined .241 in the ﬁ  rst two. 
  Neither team was strong offensively in the ﬁ  fth, but the 
Gators were able to pull out the win thanks to three aces, three blocks and an abundance of desire.
  “When a team comes at you like that, it all comes down 
to how hard you’re going to ﬁ  ght and how much you want to win,” Murphy said. 
  In other action from the tourney, No. 2 Stanford (7-0) 
ended Penn State’s (7-1) NCAA-record 109-match win streak with a sweep (28-26, 25-12, 25-18) in the tourna-
ment’s ﬁ  nal match. 
  Senior Alix Klineman led the Cardinal with 16 kills en 
route to being named the tournament’s MVP.

alligatorSports.org TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL GATORS IN THE PROS ERIKA TYMRAK SCORED 
THE FIRST GATORS GOAL.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
From heartbreak to euphoria 
in a matter of seconds. 
Stunned by a goal in the fi-
nal minute of regulation, No. 6 
Florida instantly regrouped and shocked No. 10 FSU in the open-ing seconds of overtime, scoring a 
golden goal to claim a 2-1 victory 
Friday in Tallahassee. 
It took McKenzie Barney just 
15 seconds to silence the FSU 
faithful in front of a raucous, ca-
pacity crowd of more than 2,000 at the Seminole Soccer Complex.  
“It was another Florida-Florida 
State thriller, just as we expected,” 
UF coach Becky Burleigh said. “It 
just showed great focus to come back after giving up a late goal.”
The Gators (6-0-0) overcame 
the demoralizing late goal by set-tling down before overtime and making sure they finished strong.
Barney, the team’s captain and 
eventual hero, said Burleigh told 
the team to take a deep breath 
and get the job done. Barney also spoke to the players, saying they had to believe in each other and 
know they would win the game. 
On the opening kickoff in over -
time, the Gators used a designed 
play that rarely works so perfect. The well-executed sequence took 
just four touches, including a re-
markable cross by fullback Nicky Kit. She whipped the ball into the box, where Barney finished with a well-hit strike to the near post. 
“It was a terrific finish in terms 
of the goal,” Burleigh said. “It 
was literally just like we drew up. 
Kickoff is a set piece for us. It was a beautiful serve, beautiful fin-ish.”
The game lived up to expecta-
tions, as it was a barn-burner for all 91 minutes. FSU (4-2-0) wore 
black jerseys and its fans followed 
suit, creating a loud, intimidat-ing environment for the visiting Gators. 
Burleigh chose to start a more 
experienced group Friday night, inserting Sarah Chapman and 
Lindsay Thompson into the start-
ing lineup. Burleigh said she de-cided to bring usual freshman starters Taylor Travis and Caro-line Triglia off the bench after they were able to soak up the at-mosphere and see the game prog-
ress. 
After a scoreless first half, the 
Gators finally got on the board 
in the 62nd minute off a rebound 
goal by Erika Tymrak. It was her 
first goal of the season and was set up by a strong shot and build-up from Tahnai Annis. 
The Gators continued to push 
forward following the goal, but the final 10 minutes were ago-nizing as they were forced to sit back and hold off the Seminoles’ 
relentless attack. 
UF’s offside trap wasn’t work-
ing and forced it into several late, 
unnecessary fouls. FSU was solid in its set pieces and eventually 
put one into the back of the net 
(89th minute) off an easy header from Janice Cayman. 
“It wasn’t our strategy to sit 
back and try and hold on,” Bur -
leigh said. “It’s never a good strategy and wasn’t something we were intentionally doing.”

Overtime goal sends No. 6 UF past No. 10 FSU
Through the first 97 minutes of Flori-
da’s football season, Gators fans had little reason to be optimistic. 
Florida was locked in a 7-7 battle with 
South Florida, a team that started playing college football 14 years ago, in the second game of the season after defeating Mi-
ami (Ohio), a team coming off a one-win 
year, by the embarrassing score of 34-12 at home.
The offensive line looked suspect at 
best — comically dreadful at worst. De-
onte Thompson already dropped two 
balls, John Brantley showed little of his promised passing prowess and the kicking game made more than 90,000 people hold their collective breath. 
In a sport where opinions are formed, 
cemented, changed and re-cemented with every snap, it was entirely possible that anyone tuned into Saturday’s game at 2 p.m. would’ve thought the Gators were 
the worst BCS team in the state of Florida.
Then Jeff Demps broke a 62-yard run to 
put UF ahead 14-7. The floodgates opened 
shortly thereafter and the Gators cruised to a 38-14 victory. 
And if the best half of football Florida 
has played all season wasn’t enough to make fans feel better heading into South-eastern Conference play, intra-state rivals Miami and Florida 
State crapped the bed 
in road games against Ohio State and Okla-homa late in the af-
ternoon. (To say the 
Seminoles crapped the bed is like saying John Mayer does OK 
with women, but I can’t think of the next 
level up.)
In a few short hours, the Gators were 
once again the undisputed kings of Florida — even if that only lasts until they take on 
Alabama in three weeks.
Saturday was a great example of how 
fast a knee-jerk reaction can be proven wrong, especially with UF still forming an identity after replacing so many players from a year ago. 
Last season, the Gators were supposed 
to win the national championship. They had won the year before, returned every meaningful contributor from that team ex-cept for Percy Harvin, and were led by a 
former Heisman Trophy winner and one 
of the best players in college football his-

Florida fans knew entering this sea-
son that the fastest man in college football 
wasn’t going to be caught from behind. 
But running back Jeff Demps hasn’t just 
outrun opposing defenses in the Gators’ first two games, he’s eluded upset bids.
Before Demps’ 62-yard touchdown run 
midway through the third quarter Saturday , No. 10 Florida found itself in an unexpected dogfight against an overmatched team for the second straight week. And, once again, a Demps carry swung the momentum.
Following the junior’s touchdown, Flor -
ida outscored South Florida 31-7 and out-gained the Bulls by 114 yards. 
Last week against Miami (Ohio), Florida 
gained 102 yards in two drives after a 72-yard Demps touchdown. In their previous 10 drives combined, the Gators had man-aged only 26 yards.
“You’ve got to create your own momen-tum,” offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said. “All of a sudden, you feel that energy. You feel that surge. You can see the eyes pop back open and it’s like, ‘Bam!’ Some-times that’s what you need.”
Five minutes after Demps’ touchdown 
Saturday, the Gators held a 28-7 lead.
At halftime, the speedster had only 
touched the ball five times. But he became the focal point of the Florida offense follow-
ing his long run, ending the game with 255 total 
yards on 14 touches, in-
cluding a career-high 139 yards rushing.
“Jeff Demps is a guy 
who you want to have the ball,” coach Ur -
ban Meyer said. “We were very conscious of that in the second half. Demps really had a hell of a day.”
The running back’s day also included 
a 21-yard catch negated by a holding pen-alty and a 54-yard kick return that set up a Gators field goal. When Demps touched the ball, Florida’s offense gained an average of 13.3 yards. On the 56 plays when he didn’t, the Gators averaged about 4.7 yards. 
“Those are big hits,” Addazio said. “You 
need those. It’s hard to go 99 yards. You need some hits.”
Demps’ third-quarter touchdown also 
seemed to energize the Florida defense. The Gators forced a three-and-out on the next drive, and cornerback Janoris Jenkins returned a punt 30 yards to set up Florida’s third touchdown. 
On the following drive, linebackers 
Brandon Hicks and Jon Bostic pressured USF quarterback B.J. Daniels, forcing him to throw a pass directly toward defensive end Justin Trattou, who returned the intercep-tion 35 yards for an easy touchdown.
Florida limited USF to just five first 
downs after Demps’ score.
“We were down a little bit in the first 
half,” Bostic said. “But his run, getting the 
offense going, actually helped pick us up, 
too.”
Demps proves to be game-changer
tory. 
If the 2009 Gators had a bad half 
— or beat Arkansas and Mississippi 
State by a combined 13 points in 
back-to-back weeks — the media and fans were quick to panic and demand more. 
It didn’t matter if the end result 
was a win because winning wasn’t good enough. 
The team needed to look like fu-
ture champions or the season simply 
wasn’t heading down the expected 
path.
But this year’s team isn’t last year’s 
team, and the 2010 version shouldn’t 
be held to the same standard. 
These Gators needed time to jell 
before the conference season started. 
Thanks to the way Florida stomped Charleston Southern 62-3 and Ha-
waii 56-10 in the last two season 
openers, lost in those first 97 minutes of sloppy football was the fact that UF hands these overmatched teams a 
fat check to play in The Swamp for a 
reason: If the Gators were forced to work the kinks out against respect-able foes, they just might lose.  
From here on out, winning is 
enough for this team. 
No matter how unsatisfied Gators 
fans might feel with the first two results, it could be worse — a lot 
worse. 
Just ask Miami and Florida State 
fans.KYLE , from page 14

UF sophomore Mia Piccio shot four birdies Sunday to finish with the 
second-lowest individual score in the event for the first round.

High expectations are common for the UF wom-
en’s golf team. Heading into the first round of its 
tournament Sunday, sophomore Mia Piccio was one of the latest to be in that spotlight. 
She shined. 
Piccio had four birdies Sunday — three on the 
back nine — en route to a team-leading 70 (-2) at 
the Cougar Classic at Yeamans Hall Golf Club in Hanahan, S.C. 
Coach Jan Dowling said Piccio played consis-
tently throughout the round, keeping the ball in the fairway and finding the green frequently on the back side. 
“She hit a ton of fairways, obviously made some 
putts,” Dowling said. “It was fun to watch.”
Piccio is tied for second in individual scoring 
with Katie Detlefsen of Central Florida and one back of North Carolina’s Courtney Gunter at 69 (-3). 
The No. 19 Gators sit in fourth place, but only 
seven shots back, after the first round of play with a team score of 292 (+4). North Carolina leads the 21-team field at 285 (-3). 
“We’re in the ballpark, which is great and all we 
can ask for,” Dowling said. “There’s lots of golf left to be played.”After an up-and-down outing in its first tour -
nament at the TPC at Sawgrass, Dowling said her team remained composed Sunday and she is ex-cited for what’s to come.
“That’s going to allow us to shoot those low 
numbers,” she said. “Emotionally, there’s no roller coasters going on. It’s going to allow us to go low 
when everyone gets hot.”
Junior Evan Jensen played steady on the 6,210-
yard layout shooting a +1 round of 73. Jensen 
parred 15 of 18 holes Sunday.
Dowling said the course is “a lot of fun” to play, 
with generous fairways and scoring opportunities abound. 
That proved true Sunday, as the Gators com-
bined for 14 birdies. 
Junior Andrea Watts, playing No. 1 after her 
strong finish at TPC, had four of those birdies to help balance out a +2 round of 74. 
Playing second this week, Jessica Yadloczky 
started fast. She shot a one-under on the front nine, but the senior fizzled slightly on the back to finish with a 75 (+3).
“I’m looking forward to the next two days,” 
Dowling said. “Depending on where they put the pins, I’m expecting to see some lower scores still.”UF in fourth after first round
