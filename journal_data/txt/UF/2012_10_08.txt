Coach Will Muschamp celebrates with a Gator Chomp after Florida’s 14-6 upset victory against LSU on Saturday in The Swamp. Unlike the team Muschamp called “soft” in 2011, UF won with physicality.

  With every hole Mike Gillislee 
plowed through and every would-
be tackler he dodged, the Gators moved closer to re-establishing themselves as one of the best teams 
in college football. 
  In what was billed as a statement 
game, No. 10 Florida made its point 
loudly and clearly in Saturday’s 14-6 upset of No. 4 LSU. 
  UF isn’t the same team that ﬁ  z-
zled after a 4-0 start and was called “soft” by coach Will Muschamp in 2011. These Gators have a legitimate 
shot to play for the Southeastern 
Conference title in Atlanta.
  “We’re not soft. No one can 
call us soft now,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “If we didn’t have people’s respect, we gained it today. We’re a physical team.”
  The Gators proved that on the 
ground, rushing for 176 yards and 
controlling the line of scrimmage. 
  UF ran the ball on 25 consecutive 
plays to ﬁ  nish the game, a streak that 
began when Gillislee scored from 12 yards out to put Florida ahead for good with 5:15 remaining in the third quarter.   Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst win against 
a top-ﬁ  ve opponent clearly bore his signature. A year after being ridiculed, the Gators prevailed with physicality . On Sunday , UF vaulted 
up to No. 4 in the newest AP Poll.  
  “It’s a big statement,” safety Josh 
Evans said of the win. “This is a 
good spot and a good position we’re in to open up a lot of eyes to show that we’re on the rise.”
  During the offseason, Muschamp 
preached toughness to a team that consistently struggled to close out 
games on the ground in 2011. 
  Saturday’s win validated that 
emphasis. 
  “That was fun,” Muschamp 
said with a sly smile. “It’s gratify-
ing to me because of the way we lost games last year, quite frankly . I know we’ve made improvements in the organization.”
  Florida’s line wore down LSU’s 
vaunted defense, showing the re-sults of offseason work with strength coach Jeff Dillman. 
  Gillislee did the rest, rushing 
for 146 yards and two scores on 34 carries — the most by a Gator since Fred Taylor toted the ball 34 times against Auburn in 1997. BACK ON TOP FLORIDA 14 LSU 6

� THE AGREEMENT WILL IMPROVE 
FLORIDA FARMWORKERS’ WAGES.

Chipotle agreed to pay a penny more per 
pound of tomatoes as part of an initiative led 
by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.
The restaurant became the 11th company to 
sign on to the Coalition of Immokalee Workers’ Fair Food Program on Thursday.
The program, which requires all participat-
ing businesses to pay a premium to Florida farmworkers, aims to improve workers’ wages, working conditions and educational opportu-nities.
Victor Yengle, president of Chispas at UF and farmworkers’ rights activist, said he’s thrilled with Chipotle’s decision.
“If you talk to a farmworker, you can tell 
by their voice how much this program has changed their lives,” the 23-year-old UF eco-nomics senior said.
In addition to ﬁ  nancial assistance, the Fair 
Food Program binds growers to a code of con-
duct that includes a voice for workers in health 
and safety issues, worker-to-worker education on the new protections under the code and a complaint resolution procedure.  
“Chipotle has an unmatched track record 
driving positive change in the nation’s food supply and is continuously working to ﬁ  nd better, more sustainable sources for all of the ingredients we use,” said Chipotle spokesman 
Chris Arnold in a statement.

A day of celebrations in honor of 
an achievement seven years in the 
making concluded Friday night in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
The ﬁ  nale event of the Florida To-
morrow campaign recognized the re-cord 865,000 gifts that contributed to raising more than $1.7 billion — $201 million more than the goal that was set at the 2005 launch of the campaign, according to a UF press release.
Of the 4,000 donors who were in-
vited to Friday’s event, about 700 
attended the festivities, themed “Be-
cause of you.” Attendees were served drinks from an open bar and thanked in a 50-minute ceremony that con-cluded with a UF marching band per-formance and confetti.
“The event was terriﬁ  c. Much more 
than expected,” said Al Warrington, campaign donor and UF trustee. “We almost stayed home because of the rain, but this was well worth it.”
UF President Bernie Machen ad-
dressed the crowd throughout the event. He welcomed a family whose Florida Tomorrow exceeds goal

A girl is never too old to be a prin-
cess, but maybe she’d rather be a pi-
rate.
At a tea party Saturday at Haile 
Village Bistro, children and adults alike were able to play dress up at a princess- and pirate-themed event.
The tea was part of a themed event 
series hosted by the bistro. The restau-rant hosts a formal English tea party on the first Saturday of each month.
About a dozen children sipped 
tea and munched on sandwiches — crusts cut off — at the bistro, while a performer sang Disney songs.
“We thought it would be fun to do 
something with the children,” said Jayne Yazdi, 52, co-owner of the res-
taurant.
She said the restaurant held a prin-
cess-themed tea over the summer, 
and the pirate theme was added so 
the boys would want to participate.
Angela MacKenzie, a 10-year-old 
Newberry resident, came to the tea in a long, white button-down shirt and a black, gold-brimmed pirate hat. Her 
sister, 4-year-old Marybeth, wore a floor-length white ball gown.
“I like the chocolate sandwiches,” 
Angela said, smiling.
Joe MacKenzie, Angela and Ma-
rybeth’s dad, said the tea was a nice 
event to attend with his daughters.
Families gathered around tables, some covered with blue and white 
teapots. When the event wrapped up, the little ones were carried out in their 
parents’ arms and bistro staff handed 
out small white gift boxes.
“This is exactly what I wanted,” 
Yazdi said. “To see all the people 
dressed up and the families come out 
together — that’s what it’s all about.”
Oct. 11, 1965: Graham Area hosted its annual 
Playboy party. The tradition started during Fall 1962. 
August Schildbach, president of the Graham Area Council at the time, expected 2,000 students to attend. The party costs, which were covered by admission receipts, totaled about $500 and included Playboy souvenirs such as cigars, transistor radios, beer mugs and sweatshirts.
Oct. 9, 1979: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
Amtrak shut down three train routes passing through Florida because of their failure to meet federal regu-lations. After more than a week of court arguments, President Jimmy Carter signed a law that required at least 150 passengers on each train run. The Court’s decision eliminated routes that — because of such low ridership — were “money-losers.”
Oct. 10, 1979: Gainesville city commissioners 
agreed to eliminate a city ordinance that made it a rule for businesses downtown to provide parking spots for customers. However, the ordinance also forced businesses to add parking when a business opened or expanded. It was revoked in an effort to boost downtown development.
Oct. 8, 1990: Students unknowingly bought sto-
len football tickets for the UF vs. LSU game on Oct. 6. About 50 fans showed up to the game to find their seats were taken. Angie Tipton, UPD spokeswoman at the time, said about 370 tickets were stolen from the stadium ticket office a week prior to the game.

For Lochlin Cravey, showing school spirit 
meant camping out next to Emerson Alumni 
Hall with pillows and blankets, lining up for a pancake breakfast and scoring a coveted “BEAT LSU” T-shirt Friday morning.
The wait, the 18-year-old exploratory fresh-
man said, was well worth it.
Cravey was also front-and-center for an 
event celebrating the $46 million raised for UF President Bernie Machen’s Florida Opportunity Scholars program.
Lines of students wound around the build-
ing and down University Avenue as students waited for the 9:30 a.m. breakfast of pancakes, 
bacon, eggs and orange juice.
Although they arrived an hour before break-
fast, biology freshman Yash Desai and journal-
ism and psychology freshman Jeremy Minaya were stuck at the back of the line.
Still, the 17-year-olds said they were confi-
dent about getting shirts.
Emily Astrom, an 18-year-old mathematics 
freshman, said she waited for about 30 minutes, 
but said she didn’t mind it — the T-shirt and 
breakfast were worth it.
“It’s insane, but it’s awesome,” she said.Tables with orange-and-blue tablecloths 
were set up throughout the alumni hall court-yard.
Albert the Alligator danced with students as 
“Gangnam Style” blared, hyping them up for Saturday’s match against Louisiana State Uni-
versity.
During breakfast, Machen spoke with stu-
dents and donors, thanking them for raising money for the scholarship program. He said the 
money is used to pay tuition and living expens-es for students whose families earn less than $40,000 a year and are the first in their families to go to college.
Machen’s wife, Chris, said the state’s best 
public university should have the best students, 
regardless of their ability to pay.After the event, some students — still in pa-
jamas — left carrying sleeping bags with BEAT 
T-shirts slung over their shoulders.
Morgan Cardon, an 18-year-old applied 
physiology and kinesiology freshman, said she didn’t expect so many people to show up to the event.
“I’m glad I stayed over,” Cardon said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2012

Gainesville Police arrest-
ed a political candidate’s son 
on Saturday afternoon for al-legedly resisting arrest.
Police arrested Tyler Mar -
lin Yoho, 22, of 8209 SW 95th Lane, after he got into a fight with his friend and resisted arrest from officers Saturday, according to a GPD arrest re-port.
Tyler Yoho is the son of 
Ted Yoho, a Republican can-didate from Gainesville who 
is running for Florida’s Dis-
trict 3 seat in the upcoming Nov. 6 general election.
Police gave the following 
account:
At about 3:30 p.m. Satur -
day, GPD officers responded to a call about Tyler Yoho 
f i g h t i n g 
with his friend in the 1900 block of North-west First Avenue.
W h e n 
officers ar -
rived at the 
scene, a crowd formed, and Yoho tried to incite the audi-ence by yelling and cursing about the fight.
Officers tried to calm 
Yoho, who kept going after his friend.
Police issued Yoho a no-
tice to appear for disorderly 
conduct and ordered him to 
leave.
Yoho refused and tried to 
pump up the crowd again. He also “bowed up” — clenching his fists, flexing his chest and acting like he was going to punch the officers.
An officer grabbed Yo-
ho’s wrist and told him he was under arrest, but Yoho pulled away and curled his arms close to his chest.
When police tried to sub-
due Yoho, they fell onto the side of a police car, break-ing the outside mirror and denting the car’s front right 
panel.
Yoho was arrested and 
booked into Alachua County 
Jail at about 4:30 p.m. He was released later that night, at 10:28 p.m.

� PANERA’S GOAL THIS 
YEAR IS TO RAISE $5,000 FOR THE CAUSE.

Gator fans were decked out in 
orange and blue this weekend, but 
some Panera Bread customers were thinking pink.
In honor of National Breast 
Cancer Awareness Month, pink balloons and streamers and em-ployees wearing pink hats set the scene as the bakery-cafe sold rib-bon-shaped bagels for the Panera Goes Pink benefit on Archer Road Friday.
One hundred percent of the 
proceeds from every Pink Ribbon 
Bagel sold at Panera Bread loca-
tions in Gainesville and Ocala that day will be donated to Shands at UF for women’s cancer research.
By Friday morning, 900 custom-ers pre-ordered bagels from the Panera Bread on Archer Road, said 
Megan Sones, a Panera Bread mar -
keting coordinator.
Lindy Brounley, communica-
tions director of UF Shands Cancer 
Center, said she bought two dozen bagels for her office on Friday . When she walked into the Archer Road location that morning, she said many of the orders were lined 
up on the counter.
“The place was packed,” Broun-
ley said. “We had a line of people 
going from the front counter and curling all the way back to where the eating area was.”
The raisin-and-cinnamon-fla-
vored bagel was designed espe-cially for the cause, Sones said, and 
the ribbon-shaped dough included 
dried cherries, dried cranberries, vanilla chips and honey.
“It’s making my mouth water 
just thinking about it,” Brounley said. “It is so delicious.”
Sones said Panera Goes Pink is a national campaign. Each franchise has a different local partner in or -
der to directly see the results of the fundraising.
“That’s why we partnered with 
Shands,” Sones said. “We want to directly impact the areas we are lo-cated in.”
Jillian Connolly , an 18-year-old 
mechanical engineering freshman, 
said the fact that Panera Bread do-
nates 100 percent of the proceeds makes the campaign unique.
“It really makes a statement 
that they really want to help the situation,” Connolly said. “You might be able to see the results right where we are, right here in 
Gainesville. That might encourage 
people to help out more.”“What I’m hoping is that the 
bulk of the bagel sales will actually 
be from our own people,” Broun-
ley said.
This is the third year Panera 
Bread has partnered with Shands. Last year, they raised about $4,500, and their goal for this year is $5,000, Sones said. Friday’s total was not available at press time.
Donation boxes will be on the 
counters of Panera Bread bakery-cafes in Gainesville and Ocala throughout October. At the end of the month, Panera Bread will match the total amount of donations.
Brounley said the benefit spe-
cifically supports women’s cancer research including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer.
“I think it’s been a wonderful 
success,” Brounley said. “We at UF and Shands really appreciate the fact that a big company like Panera Bread would make a special effort to raise money on behalf of our re-search.”

son and daughter both suffer from multiple sclerosis but were able to walk again after re-ceiving treatment at Shands at UF. 
Soon after, it was announced that an 
anonymous $10 million donation had been 
made and that the donors requested the 
scholarship program be renamed the Ber -
nie and Chris Machen Opportunity Scholars Program.
“I knew this was coming,” Machen said.The donation will fund 250 new Florida 
Opportunity Scholarships.
Machen said that the campaign also 
helped fund the construction of a new medi-cal education building.
“We are so proud because of what this 
means we can do,” Machen said.The campaign has increased UF’s endow-
ment from $836 million to $1.3 billion, which has allowed for the creation of 100 new en-dowed faculty positions, according to a press release from UF.
This is the third fundraising campaign UF 
has completed. Warrington said he believes it’s UF’s most successful yet.
After the confetti had settled and the 
pom-poms hit the floor, Machen raised his glass to the crowd.
“I toast to all of you because of you,” he 
said.money , from page 1“It’s making my mouth

Pam Maneeratana uses fruits and vegeta-
bles as her canvases.
Kae-Sa-Luk, the Thai art of carving fruits 
and vegetables, was the only way she knew to 
make money when she moved to the United 
States 33 years ago.
“I learned cooking, cleaning and sewing. I 
don’t think they ever taught me math,” said 
Pam Maneeratana, a Kae-Sa-Luk master.
Maneeratana taught a workshop to about 
eight people at the Alachua County Head-quarters Library on Saturday.
Travis Fristoe, the Alachua County Library 
District programming liaison, said Maneera-
tana was unique, her resume was stellar and 
there were no questions about her abilities.
“She’s an ideal guest, and we are lucky to 
have her here,” Fristoe said.
Maneeratana teaches a variety of people 
how to find inspiration in fruits and vegeta-bles by picturing an image and working with a knife.
“You will never look at a produce stand the 
same again,” she said.
Maneeratana said she never makes any-
thing traditional. She began learning to carve 
in middle school, where women were forced 
to learn it, she said.“I was a very bad student,” she said. “Af-
ter I passed the class, I never touched a knife again until I moved to the United States when 
I was 28. Carving was a start in this country , 
but it was different. This time, carving gave me peace.”
Maneeratana said she likes to find pump-
kins with different shapes or that look un-usual.
She said carving is like meditation.“You focus and concentrate really hard 
on one thing — or one fruit or vegetable — 
at a time. It’s relaxing,” she said. “You want 
to concentrate with your knife and feel every time it goes through.”
Maneeratana said beginners should use a 
variety of fruits and vegetables and keep their natural colors and textures.
“Nothing is perfect on the first time. When-
ever you force yourself to make it perfect, you ruin it. Do things by nature — have a free spir -
it,” she said.
Maneeratana said confidence is a must 
when creating carved art.
“Be confident in your carving,” she said. 
“If something goes wrong, remember it’s just a vegetable. But if you are reluctant, you will ruin it.”
Maneeratana said she began carving the 
cheapest fruits and vegetables and after some 
time just became interested in what each one 
had inside.
“You have to know your fruits and veg-
etables,” she said.
Maneeratana’s book, “Messages Found with the Carving Knife,” is available for check-out at the Alachua County Library. The book shows a variety of fruit and vegetable designs 
paired with philosophical quotes that corre-
late to how Maneeratana feels while she cre-ates her art.
Amelia Lugones, 9, said Maneeratana 
made her feel inspired to try the art.
“I don’t know what design I’ll do, but I will 
check out her book,” Lugones said.MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Sasha Gonzalez ran down 
University Avenue across from 
Midtown wearing nothing but 
her underwear twice before, but she said the third time was 
still “weird.”
Guys in button downs and 
girls in heels gawked from out-side the strip’s clubs and bars 
as Gonzalez and a few hun-dred other runners sprinted 
across UF’s campus and down 
University Avenue wearing garments like bras, boy shorts 
and boxers Friday night as part 
of the 15th Great Underwear Dash.
Gonzalez, a 20-year-old 
political science junior who wore a cheetah-patterned bra, 
said the experience is always 
unique.
“You get to run around in your underwear  — you don’t 
get to do this any other day ,” 
she said.
Gonzalez said this year’s 
run looked “a little emptier” than previous runs, though. More than 950 people re-
sponded on Facebook that 
they would attend the event, but the turnout looked to be 
less than half that number.
Runners wearing Mardi 
Gras beads, cardboard boxes, 
Superman ensembles, bedaz-zled bras, camouflage pants 
and military boots arrived on 
Turlington Plaza and stripped down to their underwear, tossing clothing in a pile on 
the middle of the plaza. The 
clothes, gathered in 24 trash bags, were donated to St. Fran-
cis House, a Gainesville home-
less shelter and soup kitchen.
Runners’ cheeks bounced 
as they tore down University Avenue across from Midtown. Cars honked and students 
came out of Buckman Hall to 
watch the procession.
Zak Bedell, a 20-year-old 
civil engineering junior, ran in pink-and-white-striped boxer shorts while juggling. He said 
he’s been participating in the 
event every Fall and Spring since a friend invited him 
freshman year.
“It’s a good cause,” he said. 
“Plus it’s really fun to say you’ve ran around campus 
juggling glowing balls in your underwear.”Students undress for charity

High school students are drinking 
and driving less because of education-
al programs.
From 1991 to 2011, the number of 
high school teenagers aged 16 and older who drink and drive decreased by 54 percent, according to a study re-leased recently by the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention.
The CDC analyzed data from the 
national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which asked high school students if they drove a vehicle after drinking al-cohol one or more times during the 30 days before the survey.   
Jill Leslie, affiliate executive direc-
tor for Mothers Against Drunk Driv-ing Northeast Florida, said the num-bers are declining because of media 
campaigns and educational programs 
such as Power of Parents and Power 
of You(th). 
Danielle Branciforte, state coor -
dinator for Florida Students Against 
Destructive Decisions, said parents 
are still the No. 1 influence on deci-
sions teens make.
Parents should set an example for 
their children and help them under -
stand why it’s illegal for them to drink 
under 21, she said.
Although there has been a signifi-
cant decrease, the study shows there 
are about one million teens who con-
tinue to drink and drive.
“The power resides in the hands of 
each teen,” she said, “and I have faith in them that they’ll make the right de-
cisions.”Students drink and drive less
“You get to run 
around in your under -
wear – you don’t get to 
do this any other day.”

What last week’s 
debate really meant
The ﬁ  rst presidential debate was last week, and boy, was it 
a doozy.
Or that’s what the media will have you think.
Most news sources have declared Mitt Romney the clear win-
ner of the debate, but really, it’s more complicated than that.
(When are politics simple, anyway?)
President Obama didn’t lose the debate by any means; he just 
didn’t walk all over Romney like we thought he would. By let-ting Romney spit his practiced “zingers,” Obama let him look like a very conﬁ  dent liar.
Now Romney can either continue his “Etch-A-Sketched” 
campaign or return to what he’s been saying forever. Stephen 
Colbert demonstrated in an episode of “The Colbert Report” last 
week just how Romney made the change: He turned an Etch A Sketch into an adorable baby rabbit.
They weren’t the only two to debate in the past week: Jon 
Stewart met with Bill O’Reilly in “The Rumble in the Air-Condi-tioned Auditorium.” They certainly brought their A-game.
We imagine preparing for a pundit battle is similar to how 
Romney studied for the debate: lots of rehearsed zingers.
“The Rumble” was “moderated by journalist E.D. Hill, who 
kicked off the night’s comic side by introducing O’Reilly as ‘the gargantuan 6-foot-4’ and Stewart as a ‘hobbit-like 5-foot-7-inch-es tall,’” according to USA Today.
The two debates were similar in tone, as they were composed 
of two men who have come to agree that they fundamentally disagree with each other for money.
That’s not to say that “The Rumble” was solely to earn mon-
ey; all proceeds will be donated to charity . O’Reilly and Stewart are just able to keep their respective jobs because they are paid to 
have an opinion. We would argue that Stewart is slightly more 
fair and balanced than his counterpart O’Reilly, but that may be because the “liberal media” is more truthful and honest than those on Fox News’ payroll.
Maybe Stewart and O’Reilly did what Obama and Romney 
couldn’t achieve. Maybe they stood by their convictions more than what we saw in Colorado. But that was only one debate.
What if Obama let Romney set himself up for a future failure 
by lulling him into a false sense of security?
It kinda puts the whole thing into perspective.Besides, it might be unfair of us to compare “The Rumble” 
to the presidential debate. One was for entertainment purposes, and one was to inform voters on the issues.
“The Rumble” might have just done a better job of capturing 
the attention of viewers because it was ﬂ  ashier; Romney did his best to connect with his audience, and Obama let him think he did.
Many people claimed that Romney won because he ended 
up not totally falling on his face and because Obama didn’t call him out on any lies.
Fear not the uncertainty that debate caused you, eligible vot-
ers. Keep your faith, for there is a light in the distance and his name is Joe Biden. He has heard your prayers, and he will an-swer them.Apple continues to control consumers
Last weekend before the game, I ran into a group of 
boys who couldn’t have been older than 12. They kindly asked me to take a photo of them. All three 
of them whipped out their shiny iPhones and handed them to me.
As a 19-year-old who doesn’t even have an Android, 
I smiled and thought about how the brains over at Apple 
have the public under mind control.
I’ve seen people use their iPads while dining at restau-
rants and even use them to take pictures and record videos at concerts. My pastor of almost 20 years now refers to his 
iPad for notes during sermons.
There are rumors now that Apple will release a smaller 
version of the already popular iPad within the next few 
weeks.
IPad Mini? IPad Air? Nobody cares what the new ver-
sion is called. People will buy it.
The update is not at all surprising because this is sim-
ply how Apple’s people work. They make a product. They create buzz about a product. They release it. Apple lovers 
spend the money to own it.
Apple then releases an upgraded or slightly different 
version of the product, and consumers pull out more mon-
ey and buy it again. Repeat, repeat, repeat.
I remember my ﬁ  rst experiences with the Apple brand. I 
was a kid who hated the occasional trip with my mother to her ofﬁ  ce on Saturday mornings. When I wasn’t forced into ﬁ  ling documents, I played on the computers with bright candy-colored exteriors. They seemed a lot cooler than the 
plain one we had at home.
It was the iMac, which debuted in 1998. The computer 
was distinct in appearance compared to other brands’ mod-
els and would serve as the basis for Apple computers for years to come.
Apple dominates our culture in a way that seems effort-
less. The brand became the standard for today’s personal and professional technology and doesn’t plan on deviating from that position. It has truly become a symbol of this gen-
eration.
Even after the passing of leader Steve Jobs, the company continues to make great advanc-
es. Apple manages to surprise consumers and bring something new when the public least expects it or feels like nothing can surpass 
the previous product.
Apple made six versions of 
the iPhone since 2007. The recent 
release of the iPhone 5 and iOS 6 software update created a frenzy 
of chaos among media and consumers.
Apple caters to the needs of its devoted followers to 
have the newest and the best technology. Releasing updates and new products frequently keeps the dollars rolling into 
the Apple corporation and ensures that brand perception 
stays high.
I personally know quite a few people who feel deprived 
if they don’t own the latest version of an Apple product.
I also know people who own iPhones, MacBooks and 
iPads all at once. It’s a little confusing to me seeing that, for the most part, the products have many of the same func-tions – especially the last two. Form seems to be the only notable difference.
A standard complaint from those whose money is a lit-
tle more scarce is that even after choosing to buy a certain product, a new version of it will debut only a short time after.
My advice is to go into a purchase knowing that anyone 
can only have Apple’s best for a short amount of time.
Somehow, dysfunctional relationships such as these are 
the ones with the strong ability to keep a hold on someone for a signiﬁ  cant amount of time.
I applaud Apple for its strategy and know it’ll continue 
to be held in the highest regard concerning technology and innovation. Apple keeps owners coming back for more and keeps prospective buyers absolutely intrigued.
Maybe I can live up to the standard of this decade and 
upgrade to an iPhone soon.

Letter to the Editor
Editor’s Note: This letter is in reference to a story that ran 
in the Sept. 25 edition of the Alligator titled “Gainesville Youth 
Baseball’s parent-run board faces setbacks.” Dave Mitchell, a 
main source in the story, gave a false name to the reporter and 
misrepresented the nature of the baseball league’s conflicts. When the reporter contacted one of the league’s board members, she refused to further explain the situation and didn’t deny the 
notes the reporter read to her over the phone. Once the facts 
of Mitchell’s identity and criminal background came to light, the Alligator removed the story from its website and printed a retraction. The Alligator deeply regrets the inaccuracies in the original story.
Dear Editor,
It is a shame that I have write to you in regards to an 
article which ran in the Alligator on Sept. 25, both in the 
print and the online versions. I have been an avid reader of the Alligator for a number of years, and I have to hon-estly say that I am very disappointed on many levels with that article. There are obvious indications of lack of fact-
checking and research. The writing style is just “all over 
the place” with no real theme to the article. I am apprecia-tive that the article was removed, and a correction ran the next day, after fact-checking too little, too late.  
The first two paragraphs of the article, describing a 
young baseball player at bat, was very descriptive and was indeed well-written. That, unfortunately, is where the accuracy of what was reported ends. I can say that the author of the article did not bother to contact me in order 
to research her article. I am not only a founding board 
member of the league, but I am also the acting president. I believe that my input would not only have proved in-sightful but was also mandatory in your staff’s protocol in 
preparing an informative and accurate article.
The article is based on representations — or misrepre-
sentations — of a gentleman by the name of Dave Mitchell 
“who has two children in the youth baseball league.” I assure you 100 percent that there is no such person asso-
ciated with the league by the name of Dave Mitchell.  Af-
ter the article was published, I contacted the staff writer and editor as to the contents of the story. The staff writer 
assured me that the person she interviewed insisted he 
was Dave Mitchell, and she stated that he even spelled his name twice for her. The person that she was refer -
ring to was a gentleman by the name of Dave Mitchum who was involved in the league as a parent of players who played for an independent organization know as the Gainesville Cobras. Had the staff writer had the real name of her source she could have Googled him as part of her research. The Gainesville Cobras is Mr. Mitchum’s orga-
nization, which is incorporated as a for-profit group. The 
Gainesville Cobras registered for the Spring 2012 season with Gainesville Youth Baseball at a reduced fee, due to the fact that they were already organized and had uni-
forms. One of the benefits of registering with Gainesville 
Youth Baseball is that the registration fee covers a full uniform for the children. However, Mr. Mitchum charged each individual parent a rate higher than what the league charged.  Yes, he profited from the registrations.
The article stated “some parents and coaches have 
complained of mismanagement.” I have not received any complaints of mismanagement. There was a direct quote from Mr. Mitchell (sic) in regards to “... games canceled 
the day of with no prior warning. They’ve changed our 
game times. We’ll show up and the other team tells us we forfeited.” If you have the opportunity to speak with any other league in our district of the Babe Ruth League or any other league in the United States, you will find 
out that game time changes and rescheduling happen 
regularly. There may be field issues, umpire issues and teams may not be able to fully participate due to school function scheduling that occurs well into the season, af-
ter the game schedule is created. This is not unusual. Mr. 
Mitchum should be well aware of this, as parents have complained that his travel teams have had tournaments canceled at the last moment. These parents are more upset because they have had a financial investment in the form 
of a prepaid tournament fee. As to being told that they 
forfeited, I am not quite sure to what that refers. Is that the mismanagement spoken about? Was it mismanage-ment when the parents of that Cobras team were asked 
to volunteer operating the league’s concession stand, and 
they would not?  
Jason Upshaw, a coach of the Cobras, was quoted say-
ing that “[p]arents are taking their kids and money and going other places.” Where? To the Cobras to pay high 
“dues” and rarely play games? The league is pleased to 
say that there are seven teams this fall. In light of competi-tion with the start of new school ventures and other sport-
ing seasons such as football, basketball and cheerleading, 
we are very pleased with that number.
I cannot speak as to the quotes from Michelle Park, 
assistant director of the city’s Park and Recreation De-partment. I can tell you that when the funding for youth athletics was reduced in the summer of 2010, a group of parents was approached to run the league under the city’s sponsorship. This sponsorship included a facilities agree-ment as to use of the fields at Westside and Greentree parks.
As for the Gainesville Cobras being in the league for 
the past few years and leaving because of trouble in the league, they weren’t. Dave Mitchum formed the team without any motivation whatsoever except how he can profit from it. There is only one issue about which the 
Gainesville Cobras, i.e., Dave Mitchum, is concerned. He 
needs a place to practice for no cost. Fine, practice to your heart’s content on any available field in the city’s parks system. There are plenty of alternatives available to his 
group.  
Oh, I get it. The mismanagement is the fact that Mr. 
Mitchum cannot use the city’s fields at his disposal and 
gratis for the operation of his business, since our season has commenced. Maybe that is why he got so upset at 
Victoria Clark’s request not to be on the field during a 
league team’s practice.  As for the alleged text, did the staff writer actually see this text? I doubt it. I have seen it, and there was no threat to contact the police. Honest-
ly, I am not surprised the police weren’t called after Mr. 
Mitchum caused a scene in front of parents and especially 
the children, being extremely aggressive in confronting 
Clark. She said nothing during this tirade.
There was no reason this article could not have been 
thoroughly researched and fact-checked. Was there re-
ally such a pressing deadline?  What really was the 
newsworthiness of this article? You are so concerned with facing “setbacks.” What about the strides that were made in this young, parent-run league? What about the care for the community in providing a safe environment 
for children to participate in organized sports? Did you 
know Gainesville Youth Baseball extends full and partial scholarship for those members of the community who are less-fortunate? Probably not. I did not realize that the Al-
ligator strove to be in the ranks of The National Enquirer. 
Certainly, with pieces written like this, that is where it is headed.

If Moisés Reyes really believes that America’s oil and 
natural gas companies are evil, there are some concrete 
steps he could take — and encourage his readers to take — to reduce the amount of money these “greedy-driv-en” corporations earn. He could start off by selling his 
vehicle and walking or biking everywhere, so he won’t 
have to use any of the fuel these companies produce. He could say no to long-distance travel on airplanes, buses or trains. He could turn off his air conditioner in his home, so he won’t use any of the natural-gas generated electricity these companies provide him. He could give up consuming cooked food, and refrigera-tion, for that matter, and cease wearing clothes and he could turn all electronic equipment made from materi-als derived from oil or natural gas. He could suggest to the millions of American retirees with 401Ks, IRAs 
and other retirement plans to tighten their belts, rather 
than bank on those investment returns. He could tell the federal government it should make do without the more than $86 million a day it collects from oil and natural gas companies. And finally, he could tell the 9.2 million Americans whose jobs are supported by the oil and natural gas industry to join the already-too-long line of unemployed Americans.
All these suggestions may sound facetious, but each 
one points to the fact that America’s oil and natural gas industry is providing Americans the energy they need to live the lives they want to live. It’s providing much-needed revenue to governments and valuable jobs to millions of Americans, and it is helping make our na-tion more energy-secure with each passing day .

Researchers at UF and at a British univer-
sity are trying to create a way to use blood 
tests to screen for breast cancer rather than using traditional mammograms.
While the researchers are working inde-
pendently, their goals are similar. The studies focus on comparing DNA markers in blood samples to detect early signs of breast cancer.
Dr. Coy Heldermon, a UF medical oncolo-
gist, said a blood test could be a much better option than the current screening methods because it would give a clearer, less invasive reading.
“I think that mammography is the best 
we’ve got, but it’s not good enough,” Helder-mon said. “If a blood test could be developed that is both sensitive and speciﬁ  c, it could 
greatly improve our ability to screen.”
The study will be done by comparing pro-
teins in blood samples from people who have 
cancer and people who do not.
“This is a method that is being pursued in 
a number of cancers,” he said.Researchers at the University of Leicester 
are also working on creating a blood test to screen for breast cancer and are about to start clinical trials, Dr. Jacqui Shaw, study princi-pal investigator at the University of Leicester, wrote in an email. 
The Cancer Research UK charity is fund-
ing the ﬁ  ve-year study in England.
She said she has received several com-
ments from women who were excited about the possible option and said they’d prefer the blood test to a mammogram.
She said the study will be done by using blood samples from 500 women to compare DNA markers.
UF ﬁ  nance sophomore Amanda Ladner 
said she wishes this type of screening method had existed when her grandmother was diag-nosed with breast cancer. Her grandmother recovered but the process was rough, she 
said.
“My grandma was 45 when she found out, 
but if she would have known sooner, maybe 
the result didn’t have to be so drastic,” the 19-year-old said.
Ladner said she hopes researchers can tar-
get the disease at any earlier stage.
“I think it would be amazing and so help-
ful for a lot of women,” she said. UF, British researchers working on blood test to screen for cancer

With one of the biggest SEC 
matchups thus far, police man-
aged thousands of Tigers and Gators fans as they packed Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on Satur-
day for the UF-Louisiana State 
University football game.
This week’s game saw a 
spike in ejection and arrest numbers compared to the pre-vious two home games this season.
On Saturday , police ejected 
108 people from the game, 38 
of whom were UF students, ac-
cording to a UPD news release.Police kicked out 27 people 
for alcohol possession and 21 others for public intoxication. Of the 27 people ejected for al-cohol possession, 25 received civil citations.
Ofﬁ  cers also ejected two peo-
ple from the stadium for pos-session of marijuana and issued a sworn complaint for someone who brought a concealed ﬁ  re-arm into the stadium.
Police arrested six people 
during the game, one of them a UF student. Out of the six ar-
rests, four were for trespassing, 
one for domestic battery and  another for resisting arrest, ac-cording to the release.
The next home game will be 
on Oct. 20.

The Election Commis-
sion ruled Sunday that both 
the Students Party and the 
Swamp Party did not commit 
any campaign violations.
The commission heard one 
complaint submitted by the 
Swamp Party and three by the 
Students Party, which were heard together.
The Swamp Party ﬁ  led a 
complaint against the Stu-
dents Party president, Sen. 
Ford Dwyer, for campaigning during three Student Senate meetings, which violates elec-
tion codes.
Sen. Truman Williams, who 
represented the Swamp Party, 
said Dwyer was campaigning 
when he discussed his ref-
erendum asking students to change the name of the Reitz Union.
Although Dwyer spoke 
during a public session, Wil-liams argued that Dwyer was acting as a senator on behalf of his party, not as an indi-vidual.
“I think his intent [was] 
very clear, and I think his party [was] supporting his in-
tent,” Williams said.
However, Christian Chess-
man, who represented the 
Students Party, said neither party had the referendum on 
its platform.
The court 
unanimously ruled that Dwyer was 
acting as an 
individual.
“I’m not 
going to 
agree we can tell a senator — or anybody from either party — they’re restricted from talk-ing about a referendum they are doing on their own,” said 
Election Commission chair-
man Wes Stephens.
The commission also 
unanimously agreed that no violation occurred regarding 
the Students Party complaint 
about Swamp Party signs.
On the ﬁ  rst day of elections, 
the commission had ordered a cease and desist, which Chess-man said the Swamp Party violated because the signs were still around Wednesday 
evening. However, there was 
no deadline on when the signs had to be removed.
The Students Party was 
concerned about the signs be-
ing left unattended.
“These kinds of signs at 
high trafﬁ  c places, on and off 
campus, constitute irreparable harm,” Chessman said.
The commission decided 
that the signs were more like banners, which can be left un-attended but need approval 
from the university and the 
supervisor of elections.
Williams said once the par-
ty was aware of the cease and desist, it made an effort to re-
move the signs.
Chessman said he plans to 
appeal the decision to the UF 
Supreme Court.
Williams did not comment 
on the rulings after the hear-ing.

Innovation Square is still being 
built, but it already secured two state 
awards for cutting-edge thinking.
The Florida Redevelopment As-
sociation awarded the Gainesville 
Community Redevelopment Agen-
cy two awards for its work on Inno-vation Square: one for best innova-tive concept and one for one of the best urban redevelopment projects in the state, according to a press re-lease.
Innovation Square, located about 
two blocks from UF, is a 40-acre area 
dedicated to developing research 
and high-tech businesses. The ﬁ  rst building in Innovation Square, Flor-ida Innovation Hub at UF, is as an incubator for startup companies.
“We’re going to support entre-
preneurship and creativity in our community,” said Ed Poppell, direc-tor of economic development at In-
novation Square.
The Square could eventually 
have 5.5 million square feet of busi-nesses, academic environments and 
apartments.
Carol Westmoreland, executive 
director of the Florida Redevelop-ment Association, said a lot of peo-ple aren’t aware of how much work the city put into developing Innova-
tion Square. The award committee 
selected the agency out of about 60 other entries.
Kelly Huard Fisher, interim di-
rector for the Community Redevel-opment Agency, said it began lay-ing the groundwork for Innovation Square about two years ago. 
Gainesville Regional Utilities, 
Shands at UF and private compa-nies are working with the agency on the plan. 
“What sets the whole initiative 
apart is the level of collaboration and planning,” Fisher said. “You re-ally don’t see all these kinds of enti-ties get together.”
Westmoreland agreed, saying the 
partnerships have made the project possible.
“It’s really a beautiful thing in 
my book,” she said.Unﬁ  nished Innovation

� FLORIDA HELD LSU TO 42 YARDS 
RUSHING IN SATURDAY’S WIN.
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
  The Florida defense believed its 2011 
performance at LSU was an aberration.
  On Saturday, they ﬁ  nally proved it.
  A year after allowing LSU to run for 
238 yards on 49 carries in a 41-11 loss, the 
Gators held the Tigers to just 42 yards on 25 rushes in Saturday’s 14-6 win in The 
Swamp. 
  “We had a chip on our shoulder from 
last year,” safety Josh Evans said. “We 
knew that wasn’t our ball last year. We’re a better team this year.”
  Saturday’s game marked the third time 
in coach Will Muschamp’s tenure that the Gators forced three or more turnovers. 
  The most important takeaway came 
in the third quarter after UF had built a 7-6 lead. LSU quarterback Zach Metten-berger connected with receiver Odell Beckham Jr. on a deep ball down the right sideline for 56 yards to Florida’s 23-yard 
line. Gators safety Matt Elam ripped the 
ball from Beckham as the two fell to the ground, but ofﬁ  cials initially ruled that Beckham was down.    Muschamp challenged the call, and it 
was overturned and ruled a fumble with possession going to the Gators. The en-
suing drive ended with a 12-yard touch-
down run from Mike Gillislee that put Florida ahead 14-6. 
  “It was all instincts,” Elam said of the 
forced fumble. “It was all playmaking. It was just great effort. That’s all it was. That’s all I could call it.”
  The Tigers’ most successful drive was 
their opening possession. They went 64 yards on 10 plays, leading to a ﬁ  eld goal 
from Drew Alleman. Jon Bostic’s personal 
foul after a 1-yard run from Spencer Ware helped the Tigers out of a second-and-17 bind.
  The Gators’ defense clamped down 
following the ﬁ  rst drive and forced ﬁ  ve consecutive three-and-outs. The Tigers only accumulated 9 yards during that span.
  “Dan Quinn and the defensive staff 
did a fabulous job,” Muschamp said. “We played well at the point of attack up front. UF defense dominates, bounces back from 2011 loss to LSU

  Jelani Jenkins ﬁ  nally got back on the 
football ﬁ  eld during Florida’s 14-6 win against LSU on Saturday. However, he 
quickly returned to the sidelines.
  The junior weakside linebacker, who 
was playing with a cast on his fractured 
right thumb, suffered a left hamstring in-
jury against the Tigers and exited the game 
during the second quarter. He did not re-turn.
  “He was running out there on that 
perimeter run on [LSU’s] sideline and 
tweaked it a little bit,” Gators coach Will 
Muschamp said. “We expect him possibly back within two to three days. I’ll know more Monday.”
  Jenkins, who injured his right thumb 
during Florida’s 20-17 win against Texas A&M on Sept. 8, underwent surgery on Sept. 10. He missed UF’s wins against Ten-nessee and Kentucky.
  Gators safety De’Ante Saunders left the 
game due to dehydration during the ﬁ  rst half, but he returned and made an impact against the Tigers. Saunders recorded two tackles and a fumble recovery on Satur-day.
  UF released an update on the condition 
of Ronald Powell’s rehabilitation from an ACL tear in his left knee. Powell had “a 
revision on his previously reconstructed ACL.”
  Muschamp said Pow-
ell’s second surgery served mainly to clean up the junior’s knee and will not force Powell to restart 
rehab. Muschamp is ex-
pected to release another 
update on Monday.
  Driskel has quiet day: Florida gained 237 
yards of total offense against LSU. Only 61 yards came courtesy of Jeff Driskel’s arm. It was lowest total by a UF quarterback in a single game since at least 1996.
  On Saturday, the sophomore signal call-
er completed 8 of 12 attempts, which were After return, junior injured again  THE ADAM BOMB
  As Will Muschamp jogged off the ﬁ  eld, the ﬁ  ery coach known for his piercing stares 
let out a smile.
  His team did it. The team he called 
“soft” 11 months ago made a top-ﬁ  ve defense look ordinary. 
  At least for a half.  After both defenses held the of-
fenses to a combined 128 yards in the ﬁ  rst 30 minutes, Florida dominated LSU offensively and defensively on 
the line of scrimmage during the last 
two quarters.
  When it was over, there wasn’t any 
doubt the Gators were the stronger 
team on Saturday in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium.
  After getting blown out by the Ti-
gers in 2011, UF outgained LSU on the ground 176 yards to 42 and ran the 
football 58 times. LSU had 50 total of-
fensive snaps.
  Florida, now ranked No. 4, belongs 
among the Southeastern Conference 
heavyweights. The noise the Gators 
are making on the ﬁ  eld is due in large part to a loud assistant coach who looks as if he should be the one making 
the tackles.
  S t r e n g t h 
coach Jeff Dill-
man, who ar-
rived in Janu-
ary from the 
IMG Performance Institute in Braden-ton, has brought more toughness to UF.
  Alabama, South Carolina and Geor-
gia: It’s time to take notice. 
  Dillman instituted an Olympic-
style lifting program, turning UF into 
the physical team Muschamp envi-
sioned when he came to Florida in De-cember of 2010. 
  “He’s crazy,” redshirt senior left 
guard James Wilson said about Dill-
man’s attitude during halftime on Sat-
urday. “He said, ‘That’s why we play four, gentlemen. That’s why we play four.’ That’s what our whole motto 
is.”

twitter: @pincus_adamDriskel has quiet day, throws for only 61 yards in Gators win
both season lows.
“Obviously, [my] stats, they’re not the 
best stats,” Driskel said. “But the only stat 
that matters is the win.”
During the second half, Driskel threw 
only four passes. 
The Gators ran the ball on their final 25 
offensive snaps, including every play in 
the fourth quarter.
“If you’re running the ball like that, 
why do anything else?” Driskel said.
While the Oviedo native did not do 
much on Saturday, he made several mis-takes. 
Driskel held onto the football too long 
on certain occasions, including a crucial 
second-quarter fumble that gave LSU pos-
session on UF’s 7-yard line.
Fortunately for Driskel, the Gators de-
fense held, and the Tigers only managed a field goal. The score put LSU ahead 6-0 
near the end of the first half.
“A good defense and a good run game 
[are] a quarterback’s best friend,” Driskel 
said. “Luckily for me, we have both.”
Clutch Christy: Kyle Christy was the 
Gators’ offense during the first half on Saturday.While Florida tallied just 47 yards on 32 
offensive plays during the first 30 minutes, Christy had three of his four punts spotted inside LSU’s 10-yard line. On those three drives, the Tigers went three and out, 
racking up just 14 yards on nine plays.
For the game, Christy had seven punts 
for 344 yards and a touchback. His long 
was 61 yards. 
The Swamp: Muschamp said the sixth-
largest crowd in school history played a significant role in No. 10 Florida’s 14-6 up-set win against fourth-ranked LSU.
For the first time since 2008, Florida 
defeated a top-10 team at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
The last instance was a 51-21 win 
against then-No. 3 LSU.
“It was alive in there tonight,” Mus-
champ said. “There’s no question our fans made a difference in that football game. They energized our football team.”
Said safety Josh Evans: “It’s probably 
the loudest I’ve ever heard [the UF crowd] since I’ve been here. They definitely helped us out there. The more juice they 
had, energy they had, motivated us even 
more to go out there and play my hardest for them.”

on the Gators. UF has erased three 
second-half deficits this season.
Florida’s defense got stronger as 
the game wore on. After LSU scored a field goal on its opening drive, UF did not allow another first down before halftime. The Tigers had five 
possessions in the second half, and 
each ended in a punt or a fumble.
The last defense to control the 
trenches against LSU was Alabama, the team that has won two of the last 
three national titles. LSU mustered 
just 92 total yards against the Crim-son Tide in the 2012 BCS Champion-ship Game.
Senior running back Mike Gillislee 
carried the football a career-high 34 times for 146 yards — 112 of which came in the second half. He scored his two touchdowns virtually un-
touched. 
“I felt like I was getting stronger,” 
Gillislee said. “It comes a lot from 
coach Dillman and the strength and 
conditioning and the training. Keep 
on fighting and never giving up.”
This isn’t the same UF team that 
was decimated by injuries last sea-son. Nor is it the same team who was 
outscored 72-22 in the fourth quarter during SEC games. 
UF is the only FBS team this sea-
son that has held its opponents score-
less in the fourth quarter. 
Florida hasn’t been this dominant 
along the line of scrimmage since 2009. UF won two national championships in 2006 and 2008 with Mickey Marotti as strength coach. He left after last 
season to work with Urban Meyer at 
Ohio State. With Muschamp’s insis-tence on running the ball from under center, the Gators needed to increase their physicality, regardless of who 
the strength coach was.
So far, so good.
“It was very evident on the foot-
ball field that we had a very strong, 
physical football team that had good 
endurance against an outstanding, athletic bunch, especially on the de-fensive side of the ball,” Muschamp said. “Credit [Dillman] and his staff. 
Those guys do an outstanding job.”
Strength coaches don’t normally 
figure in the postgame conversation. 
For the Gators, the change from 2011 
to 2012 is night and day. UF’s victory 
against LSU was won in the offsea-son.
For Dillman, the results speak for 
themselves.

We’re able to play more guys because we 
have more trust in some guys.”
The Gators followed the string of three-
and-outs with an equally impressive goal-line stand. After a Jeff Driskel fumble gave the Tigers the ball on the Gators’ 7-yard line, Florida held LSU to a field goal fol-
lowing a 3-yard rush, an incomplete pass and a run for no gain.
“Huge,” Muschamp said of the stop. 
“A lot of that goes to confidence and 
knowing you’re going to go on the field and make some stops. … They ended up trying to attempt two passes down there, (which) said a lot about how we were play-ing up front. That’s a great compliment to 
our kids.”
For the game, eight of LSU’s 12 drives were four plays or fewer. That resulted in 
a third-down conversion rate of just 7.7 percent. 
Prior to Saturday, 
Florida was allowing 
opponents to convert 
on 29 percent of third 
downs.
Thoroughly dominating the Tigers in 
the second half provided defensive end Dominique Easley with a cathartic experi-ence.
“Honestly, we wanted to come in this 
game and win,” Easley said. 
“But more, we wanted to come and hurt 
them. We wanted them to feel the pain that we felt last year, because we had hurt in our heart.”

In a hostile environment at Col-
lege Station, Texas, the underdog 
Gators tuned out the noise. 
No. 18 Florida bounced back 
from an early deficit and held No. 5 Texas A&M scoreless in the second half en route to a 2-1 upset win on Sunday afternoon in front of 2,096 fans at Aggie Soccer Stadium.  
“It’s hard to totally rattle us,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “Our maturity came through.”
The win is the seventh straight 
for the Gators (10-3-1, 7-1 South-eastern Conference) and their sec-ond this season against a top-five opponent. On Aug. 26, Florida knocked off then-No. 2 Duke 3-2 in overtime. 
The victory also snaps a 12-
game unbeaten streak for the Ag-gies (12-2-1, 6-1-1 SEC).
Throughout the match, both at-
tacks were aggressive. Each squad racked up 19 shots.
Texas A&M found the net first, 
when Shea Groom headed a corner kick from Beth West in the 22nd minute. 
“They scored, and we kind of 
looked around,” senior Erika Tym-rak said. “We knew that wasn’t go-ing to really affect us. … As soon as we started connecting more passes, it got our confidence up.”
Eight minutes later, Florida 
responded with a score from Jo Dragotta on a set piece. The se-nior’s free kick from the left side of the box sailed toward the far post. 
The ball traveled through red-
shirt senior McKenzie Barney’s legs as she tussled with Aggie goalkeeper Jordan Day. “The credit completely goes 
to [Barney], because it wouldn’t have gone in if she didn’t do a little tricky play and let it go in between her legs,” Dragotta said. “The goal-keeper wasn’t expecting that.” 
The Gators took the lead in the 
39th minute when junior Adriana Leon booted a goal from 7 yards out. Tymrak and sophomore Ha-
vana Solaun earned the assist on 
Leon’s game-winning score.  
“I heard [Leon] calling for it, 
so I played a little through ball,” 
Tymrak said. “She just nailed it. 
Incredible shot and finish.”
Despite ending the half up by a goal, Burleigh said she wasn’t 
happy with her team’s composure 
in the first 45 minutes. 
The Gators came out of the 
locker room with a methodical ap-proach on defense and clamped down on the Aggies’ attack.
Texas A&M failed to convert on 
nine shots in the second half. Soph-omore goalkeeper Taylor Burke finished the match with a season-best eight saves. 
“We did a great job of keeping 
our focus and keeping our compo -
sure,” junior defender Taylor Tra-vis said. 
“The coaches talked to us about 
some different changes and move-ments and tactics at halftime, and we adjusted to that.”
Said Dragotta: “We just stuck to 
our game plan. We know how to defend, and we took it upon our -
selves to defend for each other.”JONATHAN CZUPRYN

As Ziva Recek goes, so do the Gators — for 
better or for worse.
Going into the third set of No. 11 Florida’s 
(13-2, 7-0 Southeastern Conference) match 
against Kentucky (10-7, 4-3 SEC) on Sunday , 
the Slovenian freshman had a hitting clip be-
low zero, and her team had dropped the first two sets. But Recek forced her squad into a rhythm with each swing she took, and the Gators crawled back from a 2-0 deficit for their second five-set victory of the year (22-25, 20-25, 25-22, 25-22, 15-8).
Coach Mary Wise said the brains and the 
work ethic of her 6-foot outside hitter separate 
her from the typical freshman. Those assets 
helped Florida win despite falling behind 2-0 for the first time since Nov. 13, 2011, when UF fought back to win a five-set match against Arkansas.
“Ziva obviously carried us through some 
pretty dark moments in that match,” Wise said. “The thing we’ve been so impressed about Ziva from the get-go: one is obviously 
her volleyball IQ, but two is how hard she 
competes. It’s a pretty good combination (for) an 18-year-old.”
Recek’s 54 attacks on Sunday are the most 
by a Gator in a single match this season. And despite landing only 19 kills while racking up 9 errors for a .185 clip, she gave her team confidence as she kept swinging away, Wise said.
Senior Tangerine Wiggs said Recek never seemed down during the match, even when Florida was in danger of losing its first confer -
ence game since Oct. 30, 2011, when UF lost against Kentucky . She added that Recek’s special skills at the outside hitter position make her a key component of a young Gators squad.
“She plays so relaxed,” Wiggs said. “She’s 
not playing like a freshman at all. She’s a huge part of our team. There are balls that Ziva can get over and go for kills that I don’t know how 
she does it. I give all the credit to her.”
One of the main reasons Wise said the team 
leaned so heavily on Recek was because the 
Gators’ normally efficient passing game was non-existent early on against the Wildcats. The more Florida struggled to get the ball to its setter, Taylor Brauneis, the more it had to rely on Recek to dig the team out of a hole.
“When your team doesn’t pass well, you’re 
going to rely a whole lot on your outside hit-ter,” Wise said. “She took more swings than we would have liked, but there were times when Taylor didn’t have many options.”
Brauneis said the team was more confident 
in its passing after the second set, and because of the improved passing she could deliver more quality balls to Recek, who had a -.053 hitting percentage until the third set. Brau-
neis said it was the team’s determination to 
improve, even when down, that brought the Gators back.
“We want to stay focused throughout the 
whole entire match, whether we were down or up,” she said. “Stay focused, celebrate at the end.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida senior Lauren Em-
bree was the No. 1 recruit 
coming out of high school, won two Southeastern Con-ference Player of the Year awards and secured the Gators’ national champion-ship with a comeback victory in 2011. 
After Sunday, she can add 
a Grand Slam tournament win to her resume.
The No. 3-seeded Em-
bree defeated Virginia’s Julia Elbaba (2-6, 6-3, 6-4) in the singles championship of the Riviera/ITA All American Tournament.
Elbaba, the fourth-ranked 
freshman in the nation, had been on a tear in the Riviera, winning 10 straight matches to get to the championship. Her hot start carried over to the first set against Embree. 
But Embree showed why 
she was the sixth-ranked player in the nation, display-ing poise and skill while win-ning the second set.
“I think I played a little 
nervous in the first set and [Elbaba] was just teeing off on my shots,” Embree said. “Then I started being more aggressive and just kept fighting and hanging in there. She’s a great player and a tough competitor.”
Elbaba was serving with a 
4-2 lead in the third set, but Embree won four consecutive games to secure the match.
“Today was vintage Lau-
ren Embree — again,” as-sociate head coach  Dave 
Balogh  said. “Julia came out 
hitting the ball as hard as she could and everything was go-ing in. But once again, Lauren refused to go away. 
“She just hung in there, 
competed, fought and scraped. 
G r e a t p l a y e r s come up big in the 
clutch moments, and Lauren did that this afternoon.”
Embree is the fourth Gator 
to win the Riviera/ITA All-American Singles Champi-onship. Previous winners Jill Craybas (1995), Jessica Leh-nhoff (2001) and Allie Will (2011) all went on to play professionally after their col-legiate careers at Florida.
Embree will look to pol-
ish her resume and lead the Gators to another national championship this season. For now, Embree will live in the moment.

to win this my senior year,” Embree said. Senior wins grand

The senior running back 
inserted himself into the Heisman Trophy race, putting Florida’s offense 
on his back in Saturday’s win against LSU. Gillislee carried the ball 34 times for 146 yards, including 112 yards in the second half. He scored both UF touchdowns.
What looked like a game-changing, 56-yard completion from Zach Mettenberger to Odell Beck-
ham Jr. turned into arguably Florida’s biggest defensive play of the season. Matt Elam stripped the ball from Beckham, negating the Tigers’ longest play from scrimmage.25
Florida ran the ball on its final 25 offensive 
plays, breaking LSU’s will and sealing the 
victory. The Gators ran the ball 58 times 
overall, including 34 for Mike Gillislee — the

Christy kept LSU from 
capitalizing on Florida’s offensive futility during the first half. Christy punted seven times for 
344 yards and pinned the Tigers inside their own 10-yard line three times.Kyle

Elam had arguably 
his best game as a Gator on Saturday, recording a team-best 
seven tackles, including one for a loss.  He also forced a fumble by Tigers wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., negating a 56-yard completion.Matt

LSU was facing third and goal at 
Florida’s 4-yard line up 3-0 near the end of the first half when Tigers run-ning back Terrence Magee received a handoff. For a second, it looked like he might pass, but the Gators’ coverage 
was sound. Magee tried to run but was stuffed at the line for no gain. LSU settled for a field goal.
Trailing by eight early in the fourth 
quarter, LSU had moved to its own 45. Facing a third and 2, the Gators defensive line stuffed the Tigers’ leading rusher, Kenny Hilliard, for a 
2-yard loss. That ended LSU’s last, best chance to tie the game. Running back Mike Gillislee scam-
pered 12 yards into the end zone dur-ing the third quarter for Florida’s first score, putting the Gators up 7-6. The touchdown run capped an eight-play, 85-yard drive, which dwarfed the 47 
yards UF amassed during the first half.Stronger Gators linemen wore Tigers out on line of scrimmage
“I’m never tired,” Gillislee said. “I felt like I was getting 
stronger. I kept on fighting.”
Florida used extra blockers in jumbo sets like “chief” and 
“sumo,” pulling offensive linemen from one side of the line to 
the other to blast open holes. 
Gillislee consistently found the gaps and burst through 
them, often making a defender or two miss at the second level. 
“I’ll take ‘Gilly’ over anybody,” Muschamp said. “I mean 
that. … He’s a Will Muschamp guy.”
As Gillislee continued to roll, the Tigers wilted. Guard Jon 
Halapio said he could see the fatigue in defensive tackle Josh Downs’ eyes. Defensive end Dominique Easley saw the same.
“I was looking at people’s eyes, and they were scared,” Eas-
ley said. “The whole game of football, to me, is about breaking 
a man’s will.”
Florida has become very proficient at that this season. After 
being outscored by an embarrassing 72-22 margin in the fourth 
quarter of SEC games in 2011, the Gators are the only team in the nation to not allow a fourth-quarter point in 2012. They’ve 
outscored the opposition 41-0. 
Gillislee said UF’s conditioning is 10 times better. Guard 
James Wilson said Florida is “miles ahead of where we were.”
“We’ve beat it in their heads in the offseason,” Muschamp 
said. “We are a stronger team.”
The shift in results against LSU from 2011 to 2012 proves 
that. In last season’s 41-11 win in Baton Rouge, La., the Tigers 
outrushed the Gators by 125 yards and held an 18-minute, two-second advantage in second-half time of possession. 
This year, the Gators outrushed the Tigers by 134 yards and 
held the ball 10 minutes and 38 seconds longer than LSU did in the second half. Evans called it a “complete 180.”
“We wanted them to feel the pain that we felt last year,” Ea-
sley said. The Tigers did, and now the Gators are one step closer to 
their goal. 
“Nobody thought we were going to win, and to be the un-
derdog and get a win is a great feeling,” safety Matt Elam said. “It’s another step to Atlanta, and that’s our goal. The sky is the limit.”
But there’s still a long climb to get there. Matchups with 
SEC powerhouses No. 14 Georgia and No. 3 South Carolina loom later in October — a reminder that Florida has a long way to go to reach the summit.  
“We need to understand that as you continue to climb a 
mountain, it gets a little more dangerous,” Muschamp said. 
Those are problems for next week. Even with an eye toward 
the future, now is a time for celebration. The Gators are back to being tough, back to being a powerhouse and back in the championship chase. 
“This is a dream come true,” Gillislee said. “I’ll never forget 
this moment, the feeling, the win. It’s my opportunity , and I’m going to do the best I can to keep this opportunity going.”
