When Raymond Chobaz waved his baton 
in the air, the symphony followed suit.
His experienced right hand never faltered.
Chobaz was standing in front of 80 or so 
students during a Wednesday evening re-
hearsal. It’s where he’s stood for 33 years. The 
sound of violins and cellos rose dramatically as his arm movements became more erratic. The room was alive.
Without his direction, music notes would 
clash. Instruments would scream. The stu-dents would play too fast, and the ballet danc-ers would trip.
“It’s chaos,” Chobaz said. “And then it falls 
together on performance night. It’s magic.”
Chobaz, 68, reigns as music director and 
conductor of the UF Symphony Orchestra.
But at the end of this semester, Chobaz, 
who also has a physics and math background, is taking a research leave to work with Nobel Prize-winning Swiss chemist, Richard Ernst.
His absence will be noted by those he’s en-
countered over the last three decades.
Loved by students and highly regarded by 
faculty, Chobaz has become a known ﬁ  xture in the music school. When he accepted the offer, he knew running an orchestra within an aca-demic institution wouldn’t be easy.
But with conﬁ  dence, Chobaz took on the 
UF orchestra before grandiose ballet and opera productions were in his job description.
“Now, we do the whole gamut,” he said.
Al Zhang, a 20-year-old engineering junior, 
described Chobaz as a kid in a candy store 
when it comes to music.
The son of a ballerina and an actor, Chobaz 
always knew what he wanted to do.
“I feel like a ﬁ  sh in water,” Chobaz said 
about conducting. “I’m in my element.”
At 24, he left his birthplace of Switzerland 
to pursue music education in the U.S., trav-eling with nothing more than a tiny suitcase packed with pairs of pajamas and some socks.
His resume now displays four degrees rang-
ing from a bachelor’s degree in physics and math to a doctorate in music composition from the University of Utah.
A nationally and internationally recognized 
musician, Chobaz hopes to inspire his students as his professors once inspired him.
“To see that these kids grow from the ﬁ  rst 
rehearsal to the last — it’s such a difference — that process makes you happy,” he said.The orchestra’s primary job is to put on 
symphony concerts. It puts on between four 
and six a year. Each concert involves 80 to 100 
orchestra students and can also include up to 200 choir singers or 50 ballet dancers.
“I can give you my job description, but it’s 
about two pages,” Chobaz said, laughing.
Rehearsals are held twice a week, and it 
takes eight to 12 rehearsals to prepare for a show. Some productions, like the world pre-miere of a new opera in April last year, require 16- to 18-hour days, seven days a week.
But it’s not the long hours that keep Chobaz 
up at night. Budget cuts have caused the art programs to collapse since Gov. Rick Scott took ofﬁ  ce, Chobaz said.
“They expect champagne from us,” he said, 
“and we don’t have the ingredients for the

Bernard Mair, associate provost 
for undergraduate affairs, said the university had to get approval 
from the Florida Legislature to de-
sign a Spring-to-Summer concept and allow IA students to use their Bright Futures scholarship during 
Summer semesters.
The scholarship doesn’t cover 
the Summer terms for traditional students or the Fall for IA stu-
dents.  
The Florida Legislature can 
vote to change that for the Sum-mer semester for traditional stu-dents with the $23.5 million pro-posal in Gov. Rick Scott’s Keep 
Florida Working budget. However, 
Mair said he does not know of any plans to cover the Fall semester for IA students. 
“We would like for Bright Fu-tures to cover students for any se-mester,” Mair said.

THERE WILL BE EVENTS 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TO 
END THE WEEK.
By Lilianne Busto
Alligator Contributing Writer
To prepare for a more peaceful future, 
we must remember the past. 
That’s the goal of Genocide Awareness 
Week, which will include a series of events to honor the lives lost in tragic events 
throughout history, including today’s Ho-locaust Remembrance Day. 
“It’s coming together as a 
university to remember this event in the hopes of it never happening again,” said Ra-
chel Sharpe, 20, the Genocide 
Awareness Week marketing director and a UF public relations sophomore.
From 4:30 to 5:30 p.m. Friday, a testi-
monial from a Holocaust survivor will be held at UF Hillel. UF’s Holocaust Remem-brance Walk will begin at 5:30 p.m., and 
the walk will go from Hillel to 
the Plaza of the Americas.  
“My favorite is probably 
the walk because it is mak-
ing a statement on campus,” 
said 20-year-old Tyler Ellman, 
Genocide Awareness Week co-director and 
a UF general theatre and telecommunica-tion sophomore. 
Last year 50 people participated in the walk, and this year Ellman said they hope to double that. 
Liesel Appel, a daughter of a Former 
Nazi who converted to Judaism, spoke at UF Hillel on Tuesday night, and there was a showing of the movie “Hotel Rwanda” on Wednesday night.
The week of remembrance will end at 
7:30 p.m. Saturday with the UF Choral Union’s concert, Protest Requiem, at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.  UF hosts Genocide Awareness Week to honor survivors
al expenses are projected to cost $18,260 for in-state IA undergrad-uates as opposed to $20,590 for 
traditional students for the 2015-
16 school year, according to the Student Financial Affairs ofﬁ  ce. 
There is a reduction in hous-
ing and food costs because of the shorter Summer semester, Orlan-do said.
IA’s total operational budget is 
$94,000, which is largely for stu-
dent programs, such as “Launch 
into IA,” “Catalyst” and “Discover IA,” as well as employing students and ofﬁ  ce expenditures. The Pro-
vosts’ ofﬁ  ce provides $76,000 for 
IA advisers. 
NEW HOUSING: INFINITY HALL
Inﬁ  nity Hall, an off-campus 
ﬁ  ve-story residence hall, is set to be ﬁ  nished in July. Located at 
978 SW Second Ave. across from 
Innovation Square, it is geared to-ward IA students and will be the country’s ﬁ  rst entrepreneurial aca-
demic residential community, ac-cording to Alligator archives. 
The $24 million building will 
feature residential living space, 
team meeting rooms, space for the university’s entrepreneurship pro-grams and a resident maintenance shop. The building will also house 
“makerspaces,” which include a 
classroom, 3-D printing lab and workspace for students to develop products. 
Rental rates are still to be de-
termined but should be similar to those of Hume Hall, which cur-rently costs $3,574 to $3,783 per 
person per semester, according to 
Alligator archives.

The UF Symphony Orchestra is 
given $18,000 to $20,000 per year 
to be used for hall rental, music pur-chase and rental, personnel hires 
and student scholarships, John Duff, 
UF School of Music director, said.
If Chobaz were to set a budget, he 
said he would ask for $30,000. But even that wouldn’t be enough.
Chobaz’s home has a museum 
feel to it, with ancient Navajo Indian artifacts adorning the walls. His of-fice walls are covered from floor to ceiling with abstract music posters.
He grimaces when politics are 
mentioned, and his eyes light up when asked about his students. When conducting, he thrashes his 
body forward and shakes his shoul-
der-length wispy grey hair from side to side. He’s theatrical.
Chobaz sat in his dimly lit living 
room on a rainy Monday evening, lost in his own train of thought. His voice isn’t what one would expect from a man who stands just below 6 feet tall with a large build; it’s soft and almost childlike.
In a distinct Swiss accent, he 
spoke of spirituality, of finding one’s calling and of how art is an activity of the soul. He was reminiscent of a modern-day Beethoven.
But in his office in the Music 
Building, Chobaz showed his hu-morous side. He joked. He smiled often. Students reciprocated, poking fun at his accent. 
A single father of three, he’s the 
kind of professor students want to eat their lunch with.
“He’s really warm and inviting,” 
said Hannah Feldman, a 19-year-old 
music and finance freshman. “We 
hug here.”
But until he returns in August 
2016, the hugs will be scarce and the orchestra will be a little less in sync. 
Because without his direction, 
music notes would clash, instru-ments would scream, the students would play too fast and the ballet dancers would trip.
“I’m with them on that stage,” he 
said. “We fall or win together.”ORCHESTRA,  from pg 1He will return Fall 2016

Campaign tactics won’t help Hillary’s track record
Hillary Clinton decided to shake things up 
when she announced her presidential campaign Sunday. Instead of launching her candidacy with a forced, painfully rehearsed, one-on-one conversation with 
a camera like she did in 2007, Clinton released a well-executed video with a diverse cast of char-acters.
John Dickerson of Slate noted the video fea-
tured “expectant parents, job seekers, a same-sex couple on the verge of marriage and women of all ages and ethnicities.” These people were the reason Obama won in 2008 and Clinton lost.
Only after 90 seconds of the two-minute video do we see 
the Democratic candidate.
For the most part, the campaign video did a great job of 
hiding the weakest aspect of Hillary’s 2008 campaign and potentially the weakest aspect of her 2016 campaign: Hillary Clinton.
Many people forget that in 2008, she was the favorite to 
win the Democratic and general elections. She was so certain to win the only person that could thwart her trip to the Oval Ofﬁ  ce was Clinton. In the end, that’s exactly what happened.
Clinton is a lot of things, but a campaign virtuoso is not 
one of them. She lacks the political instincts and extrover-sion of her husband, as well as the hope that surrounded Obama’s campaign. On the campaign trail, she’s wooden and cold. All of her stump speeches feel like they’ve been rehearsed a hundred times in front of her staff. The words in her speeches have been precisely picked and employed for maximum effect, only after focus groups and polling data have greenlighted them. Even Clinton’s full-belly cackle 
seems poll-tested.
And let’s not forget about her Mitt Romney-like unrelat-
ablilty. Hillary has been in a bubble since her time as the ﬁ  rst 
lady of Arkansas. She lives in a mansion in New York. She gets paid megabucks for her speaking engagements. I doubt many Iowans can relate to this. Though, Republican opera-tives quipped that she relates to those Americans that live a chauffeured life.   All of these are characteristics of a bad cam-
paigner.
While Clinton does not pride herself on her 
campaign skills — for good reason — she is per-ceived to be a much better manager. But even this 
leads her into trouble. Despite the fact that she 
has been in more political ofﬁ  ces than practically any other career politician, her tenure in the State Department, Senate and White House have been ﬁ  lled with folly.
All of her accomplishments at the State Depart-
ment are now crumbling before our eyes. Her “reset” with Russia has plunged us almost into a new Cold War. The Lib-yan Intervention she promoted contributed to the attack on 
our consulate in Benghazi. Terrorism is spreading across the 
world. She tripped over herself when she attempted to “pivot to Asia.” Pundits often say that no Republican can match her tenure and foreign policy credentials. For the GOP, this is a great thing. Nobody wants to defend her abysmal record as secretary of state.
As a senator from New York, Clinton voted for the Iraq 
War and cozied up to Wall Street fat cats. This is as far away as you can go from the Elizabeth Warren-oriented Demo-
cratic party of today. While she was ﬁ  rst lady, she rolled out 
the disastrous health care policy Hillarycare. 
A ﬂ  awed campaigner and ﬂ  awed politician do not bode 
well for presidential politics. In spite of this, Hillary is ready to be crowned U.S. president in 2016, just like she was ready to be crowned in 2008.        
But this election is different in a few ways: The voting 
base has become more cynical and is not prone to lofty rhetoric, the incumbent has been a divisive Democrat with 
a mixed record and foreign policy is likely to be front and 
center in the race. None of these things are likely to favor Hillary Clinton. But again, the 2016 election is her election to lose. The only person stopping her from sitting down and cackling in the Oval Ofﬁ  ce is herself. I would say that’s not very reassuring for Team Hillary.
Michael Beato is a UF economics junior. His column ap-
pears on Thursdays.A tree is nice, but 
Mickle deserves a 
building
At 4 p.m. today, a tree dedication ceremony will be held on the UF Law West Courtyard. The ceremony will be held in honor of Judge Stephan P. Mickle, the ﬁ  rst African-American to graduate from UF and the second to graduate from UF’s Levin College of 
Law.
After graduation, Mickle went on to have an impressive 
career. He’s served as a judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, as the judge for Alachua County, as a circuit court judge of the Eighth Judicial Circuit and in Florida’s First District Court of Appeal — in addition to his private practice here in Gainesville.
Anyone who graduated from UF and went on to a ca-
reer like that deserves to be recognized. The tree dedica-
tion ceremony is well-deserved, and we thank Mickle for 
his service.
But something’s missing here. You see, Stephan Mickle 
didn’t just hold these positions of honor; he was the ﬁ  rst black man ever to serve in any of those positions. He per-sonally broke seven barriers erected by Jim Crow segrega-tion by the count of his achievements above. This man isn’t just a good judge. He’s a hero.
Yet, we express our gratitude by giving him ... a tree.
We’re not out to rain on anyone’s tree dedication cer-
emony. We simply believe Mickle deserves more recogni-
tion than he’s getting. And when we consider the buildings on this campus whose facades sport the names of vicious segregationists and other objectionable people, the situation goes from imbalanced to absurd pretty quickly.
The most egregious example is George Smathers, name-
sake of the ﬂ  agship library here on campus. He was one of Florida’s U.S. senators from 1950 until the late ‘60s. He was 
also a committed segregationist. According to his biogra-
phy on the Smathers library website, he “voted consistently against meaningful civil rights legislation, and spoke in fa-vor of segregation and states rights,” supporting segrega-tion, in his words, “now and forever.” As you read this, there are students working in a library whose namesake fought to deny them access to UF. It’d be safe to assume he would not have wanted Mickle here.
Then, we have the Reitz Union, named after former UF 
President J. Wayne Reitz. He was president during the same period. During that time, Reitz cooperated with a group of Florida legislators later known as the Johns Committee. The committee was originally formed by a group of segregation-ist legislators to investigate civil rights activists; it became an organization dedicated to purging gay and lesbian stu-dents and professors from UF and other Florida schools. He also ﬁ  red professors who were active in the civil rights movement. Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n, Jr., — after whom the Swamp 
is named — served on this committee.
These people had buildings named after them because 
they were distinguished alumni, powerful UF administrators 
and major donors to the school. Today, though, their con-tributions feel like more of a blight than a blessing. While these buildings stand named the way they are, now they mock the accomplishments of men and women like Mickle. 
Mickle is a dedicated public servant and outstanding hu-
man being — he should be honored accordingly. His name 
should be on a building.THURSDAY, APRIL 16, 2015

After years of selling out shows 
all over Gainesville, The Shitty 
Beatles will take the stage for its 
ﬁ  nal shows this weekend.
The band will perform six differ-
ent sets during the two-night event 
opening Friday and closing Satur-
day at High Dive, 210 SW Second 
Ave. Doors open at 8 p.m. and the show begins at 10. 
Advance single-night passes can 
be purchased for $10 and two-night 
passes are $15 on ticketweb.com.
What happens when it’s sum-
mer 2005 and there’s nothing go-
ing on in Gainesville? For a group of talented musicians, the result is a decade-long project that has en-ergized local crowds during every 
performance.
“We just kind of had to ﬁ  nd 
something to do, so we said, ‘Why 
don’t we start playing Beatles 
songs?’” vocalist and guitarist Tra-
vis Atria said.
The band met after Travis and 
his brother, Eric Atria, moved to Gainesville from Hollywood, Flor-ida, in 2003. At the time, bassist Eric and guitarist Travis were in a band called Morningbell. For-
mer drummer Jake McMullen and 
keyboardist Collin Whitlock were in another band, Maxwell Edison — a reference to the Beatles song, 
“Maxwell’s Silver Hammer.”
“We used to see ﬂ  iers for them 
around town, and we always kind 
of wondered, ‘Who are these guys?’ because we love the Beatles, and we liked the fact that they had named themselves after a Beatles song,” Travis Atria said.
The bands met in 2004 after 
playing a show together. With half of their band members out of town the summer of 2005, the musicians decided to take on a side project that would turn into a decade-long 
venture.
“I think the thing that made 
it last this long is the fact that so many people liked it, and so many 
people have come see us,” Travis Atria said. “I mean, it’s hard to stop doing it at that point.”
The band’s lineup now includes 
drummer Chris Hillman, who joined the band after McMullen moved to Finland. Hillman had originally joined Morningbell as its 
drummer before playing with The 
Shitty Beatles.
The band had stopped playing for about a year and thought they weren’t going to play anymore un-til they were asked to do a John Lennon tribute show.
“So we did that. We only played 
John Lennon songs with Chris, who became the new drummer,” Travis Atria said. “We got such a good response, we decided to start 
doing it again.”
Travis Atria said the band’s 
popularity rose after its return from a yearlong break.
Since then, The Shitty Beatles 
continued to delight crowds of 
about 400 people with fan favorites 
such as “Hey Jude,” “Helter Skel-
ter” and “Something.”
“Something’ is probably one of 
my favorites because that’s my fa-
vorite guitar solo in the history of 
guitar solos,” Travis Atria said.
But now, with families and ca-
reers, the band is stopping for good 
this time. 
“You know, I think it’s just a 
more natural time to stop,” Travis 
Atria said.
For the opening night of its ﬁ  nal 
shows, the band is putting together 
a special all-acoustic set. Fans can 
expect some of the softer songs 
that the band usually doesn’t get to play, such as “Yesterday,” “Black-bird” and “Across The Universe.”
Travis Atria said a lot of the 
band’s crowd consists of the younger generation.
“It’s kind of cool to see how 
the same obsession we have with the Beatles, they’ve got it, too,” he said. “The next generation is pick-ing up on it as well.”
Among them is 20-year-old 
Travis Andrews, who has been to three of the band’s shows and will be attending the last one.
Andrews said he’s glad to have 
grown up on his parent’s music and added how impressed he was by the band’s similarity to The Beatles.
“It’s cool going to these shows 
because everyone can unite in en-joying the same thing,” he said.The Shitty Beatles to ‘come together’ for ﬁ  nal performances

The Mischievous Madams Troupe is celebrating its two-
year anniversary with some naughty burlesque Saturday 
night. 
The troupe’s showcase will be held at the Market Street 
Pub and Cabaret, 112 SW First Ave. Doors open at 9 p.m., and the show starts at 10 p.m. for those who are 18 and over. There will be an $8 cover at the door. 
A member of the troupe who goes by her stage name, Sally B. Dash, said because it is an anniversary showcase, various special acts will be done. 
One of the members who goes by Sally Sucre will be 
performing a burlesque roulette act based on the song the audience picks.“If you want to vote for a song, come to the show,” 
Dash said. 
It is adult entertainment, but Dash said the comedic 
strip tease is innocent.
“We have pasties and panties,” she said. “That is the 
highest level of nudity we allow in the show. We have to cover our nits and little lady bits.”
The anniversary showcase will allow the members to 
perform their favorite act for the audience, said a troupe member who goes by Stella O’Hare onstage.
“I am excited to see what the other performers have 
put together, since no one really knows what we are all doing,” she said. “It’s a surprise.”The Mischievous Madams Troupe to celebrate two years

Aer is returning to Gainesville tonight.
The hip-hop and reggae duo comprised of vocalists Da-
vid von Mering and Carter Schultz from Wayland, Massa-chusetts, will be performing at the High Dive, located at 210 SW Second Ave., along with performances from Jez Dior and 
Packy. Doors open at 8 p.m. and the show starts at 9 p.m. 
Tickets can be purchased at the door for $18 or in advance for $15 at ticketweb.com, Hear Again Music and Movies or at the High Dive.
“It’s just going to be a beautiful scenery of music. You’re 
just going to see, feel and touch the music,” Mering said. “It’s going to bring everybody down to earth, as well as make them feel like they’re already in heaven.”
After the release of their ﬁ  rst full-length album, “The 
Bright Side,” in July 2012, Aer has performed around North America and Europe with Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Dirty Heads and Hoodie Allen. Their self-titled album, released in January 2014, landed the duo a No. 26 spot on the Billboard Top 200 Chart and resulted in a sold-out nationwide tour.
Even with the spotlight, Schultz said that the duo never 
tries to mask their feelings or hide who they really are in the music they make.
“The thing is, we’re still human, and we’re still going through the same problems that so many people do,” Schultz said.
Schultz said he wants to keep the vibe fun so that people 
can see themselves within the band.
“Realistically, our main focus is on having fans who want 
to have fun and who want to party with us,” Schultz said.
Pat Lavery, the owner of music promotional company 
Glory Day Presents, wrote in an email he believes this could very well be a sold-out show.
“Gainesville loves its hip-hop and reggae rock, and Aer is 
a high energy blend of the 2 genres,” Lavery said.
The audience at tonight’s show can expect to hear a mix 
of old and new music, along with the band’s ﬁ  rst single, “I Can’t Help It,” featured on their new album.
After all the tours, endless mobs of crowds, sold-out 
shows and billboard hits, Mering said that if he could go back in time and sit down with his 16-year-old self, he wouldn’t 
change anything that has happened to him; everything hap-
pens for a reason.
“I would tell myself to go as hard as you can,” Mering 
said, “I don’t regret a thing.”Hip-hop, reggae duo Aer to return

Students can wrap up their 
Spring semester by watching the 
Dirty Heads perform Wednesday 
night.
Student Government Produc-
tions is presenting the reggae band 
as part of its second free show of 
the semester, along with Mayday 
as the opening act. 
The show will be held at the 
Phillips Center for the Performing Arts at 8 p.m. Doors open at 7.
Seating for the show is ﬁ  rst 
come, ﬁ  rst served. Students with a Gator 1 Card can claim two tick-ets at the Phillips Center Box Of-
ﬁ  ce starting Tuesday at noon, said 
Whitney Congress, the vice chair of public relations of SGP and a 21-year-old public relations senior.
SGP bought out the tickets for 
$35,000 from Anschutz Entertain-ment Group Live, an entertainment company that originally booked the band, Brad Wheeler, chairman of SGP, wrote in an email.
“We are doing ticket subsidy for 
the Dirty Heads,” he said. “We are not bringing them ourselves.”
The Dirty Heads are from Hun-
tington Beach, California. The group is committed to telling their 
story through their feel-good reg-
gae music, Congress said. 
The opening act for the show, 
Mayday, is a hip-hop style group 
from Miami.
The Dirty Heads were chosen to 
perform after SGP received feed-
back from a survey sent out to UF students. The results suggested students 
wanted to see a different genre of music than what SGP has recently offered.
“We haven’t had a reggae or 
rock band in a while,” Congress 
said.
This prompted the ﬁ  rst free 
show, Edward Sharpe and the 
Magnetic Zeros, as well as the up-
coming show.
“(The Dirty Heads) wanted to 
come to the University of Florida. 
They thought it would be a good venue for them,” Congress said. 
“It’s right before ﬁ  nals begin, so 
it’s a great time to come out and relax.”
Jenel Schwind, a 19-year-old UF 
ﬁ  nance sophomore, said she plans to attend the concert.
“It gives people the chance to 
take a quick break right before they have to take their ﬁ  nals,” she 
said.Dirty Heads to perform Wednesday

The semester coming to an end can only mean that two 
things: more time to dedicate to drinking and binge watching 
shows on your borrowed Netﬂ  ix account. If you loved “30 Rock” 
and haven’t found the time to watch Netﬂ  ix’s breakout show, 
“Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” do yourself a favor and catch up on Tina Fey’s latest creation (don’t worry, she makes a special appearance, too). Aside from laughs, you’ll get a strong sense of 
female empowerment, as its catchy theme suggests. UNBREAK ABLE

With a pressure-inducing 
work period of only eight weeks, 
Raf Simons, creative director for 
the French fashion house Dior, 
must create his ﬁ  rst collection amid various constraints in Fred-eric Tcheng’s new documentary, 
“Dior and I.” 
The ﬁ  lm, set to be released in 
Gainesville on May 8, taps into a 
more human side of the fashion industry that can be appreciated 
by even those who believe “haute 
couture” is just the sound of someone sneezing.
“Dior and I” follows Simons 
and his skilled team of seam-stresses and employees as they attempt to live up to the long-last-ing legacy of Christian Dior, the founder of the company whose 
enigmatic voice is presented 
through artful sequences with voice-over passages from past journal entries. 
In trying to positively repre-
sent the Dior name, the team has to balance efﬁ  ciency with limi-tations, and the tiniest mishaps can derail any progress — even an elevator getting stuck and an 
employee leaving the ofﬁ  ce to 
assist a client prevent numerous dresses from being shown and ﬁ  t on a certain day.
The budget, time and design 
complications take an emotional toll on the team, adding to the tense tone of the documentary. Simons becomes stressed and angry in many scenes, as he is 
worried certain designs will not 
be produced in time, if at all. One anxiety-ridden seamstress often has to step away, struggling to re-main calm. 
Yet the emotions add a rare 
human element to the ﬁ  lm. From the negative turmoil stems en-dearing relationships and bonds between the employees, whether 
they worked at the company for 
only a few weeks or for more than 30 years. 
They develop a determination 
to persist through the difﬁ  culties, and their individual quirks make for a refreshing take on the peo-ple working behind the scenes in the industry.
Getting a peek into the elusive 
luxury company is a rare privi-lege, but Tcheng manages to pres-ent Dior as an inviting company 
rather than one that has a stereo-
typically harsh atmosphere like in mainstream fashion ﬁ  lms. His directorial choices create a well-timed and visually pleasing ﬁ  lm 
about the nuances in the inner 
workings of the business. 
Even the least fashionably in-
clined will be touched by its hu-
manity and ﬁ  nd themselves root-
ing for Simons and his crew.

Saturday marks the eighth annual Record Store Day, and 
local record stores are preparing for an inﬂ  ux of shipments 
and a swarm of awaiting customers.
Hear Again Music and Movies will open its doors at 9 a.m. 
and close at 11 p.m. Arrow’s Aim Records will open at noon and close at 8 p.m. Customers are encouraged to arrive early to reserve a spot in line.
“Last year, we had a line wrapped around the building for 
ﬁ  ve hours,” said Andrew Schaer, owner of Hear Again.Record Store Day has grown every year since its start in 
2008. The idea was established in 2007 as a way to celebrate 
the unique culture of independently owned record stores.
Schaer said he believes the vinyl resurgence has a lot to 
do with its increasing popularity.
“There’s a very large social dynamic to records that other 
formats don’t have,” Schaer said. “People get together and spend hours listening to records at night. People don’t do 
that with hard drives.”
Alexander Tongue is a record store regular who owns 
a 700-piece record collection, with his favorite being Billie 
Holiday’s “Lady in Satin,” the ﬁ  rst record he purchased at Hear Again.
Tongue, who’s been to record stores all along the East 
Coast, has taken part in Record Store Day in Gainesville for 
the last three years.
“I don’t think people in Gainesville are very aware of the 
fact that we have two of the best record stores in the South-east in our town,” Tongue said.Local shops prepare for 8th annual Record Store Day

FALL RIVER, Mass. — Former 
New England Patriots star Aaron 
Hernandez was convicted of first-
degree murder and sentenced to life in prison Wednesday for a 
deadly late-night shooting, seal-ing the downfall of an athlete who once had a $40 million con-
tract and a standout career ahead 
of him.Hernandez, 25, who had been 
considered one of the top tight ends in professional football, pursed his lips and sat down after 
the jury forewoman pronounced 
him guilty in the slaying of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper and amateur weekend football player who was dating the sister 
of Hernandez’s fiancee. The con-
viction carries a mandatory sen-tence of life without parole and automatically triggers an appeal to Massachusetts’ highest court.
Hernandez’s mother, Terri, 
and his fiancee, Shayanna Jen-kins, cried and gasped when they heard the verdict. Jenkins wept 
loudly on his mother’s shoulder. 
Hernandez, his eyes red, mouthed to them: “Be strong. Be strong.” Lloyd’s mother also cried.
Jurors deliberated for 36 hours 
over seven days before render-ing their decision, which also in-cluded convictions on weapons charges.
“The jury found that he was 
just a man who committed a bru-tal murder,” District Attorney Thomas Quinn said after the ver-dict. “The fact that he was a pro-
fessional athlete meant nothing in 
the end.”
Lloyd was shot six times early 
on June 17, 2013, in a deserted 
industrial park near Hernandez’s 
home in North Attleborough. The motive has never been explained.
Police almost immediately ze-
roed in on the former Pro Bowl 
athlete because they found in 
Lloyd’s pocket the key to a car the NFL player had rented. Within hours of Hernandez’s arrest, the 
Patriots cut him from the team. 
The team declined to comment on the verdict.Prosecutors presented a wealth 
of evidence that Hernandez was with Lloyd at the time he was 
killed, including home security 
video from Hernandez’s mansion, witness testimony and cellphone records that tracked Lloyd’s movements.
Hernandez’s lawyer, James 
Sultan, acknowledged for the first time during closing arguments that Hernandez was there when 
Lloyd was killed.
But the attorney pinned the 
shooting on two of Hernandez’s 
friends, Ernest Wallace and Car-los Ortiz, saying his client was a 
“23-year-old kid” who witnessed 
a shocking crime and did not know what to do. Wallace and Ortiz will stand trial later.
Prosecutors have suggested 
Lloyd may have been killed be-cause he knew too much about Hernandez’s alleged involvement in a 2012 drive-by shooting in 
Boston that killed two. But they 
were not allowed to tell the jury that because the judge said it was speculation.
As a result, they never offered 
jurors a motive beyond saying Hernandez appeared angry with Lloyd at a nightclub two nights before the killing.
In the 2012 case, Hernandez is 
accused of gunning down a pair of men over a spilled drink at a nightclub.

nates spoke to reporters Wednes-Former UF football player Aaron Hernandez convicted of murder

Florida is the regular season Big East 
champion. 
Following its rout of Cincinnati on 
Wednesday and UConn’s loss to Georgetown 
later in the day, the UF lacrosse team claimed the title in its first year as a member of the conference. 
No. 8 Florida (12-4, 6-0 Big East) closed 
out its regular season home schedule on Wednesday afternoon with a 20-1 defeat of Cincinnati (2-13, 0-5 Big East). 
It was the Gators’ sixth straight win and 
the Bearcats’ eighth straight loss. Florida out-shot Cincinnati 28-2 in the first half alone and 38-6 for the game.Sophomore Mollie Stevens got the scor-
ing barrage started just 1:01 into the match. 
With that score, Stevens tied the program re-
cord for consecutive games with a goal – 20.
“Yeah, and she’s only a sophomore. I 
mean, goodness gracious,” coach Amanda 
O’Leary said of Stevens. “She comes out ev-
ery day, works extremely hard, and I think all that hard work certainly pays off when you see streaks of goals scored. It makes sense.”
After junior Darcy Messina made it 10-0 
Florida with 16:22 left in the first half, O’Leary emptied her bench and replaced all of her starting players except goalkeeper 
Mary-Sean Wilcox.
Only six of the Gators’ 20 goals ended up 
being scored by starters.
Given the opportunity, Florida’s second unit stepped up and verified the depth that 
the Gators possess. A program record 16 
players scored a goal for Florida, and four 
of them had their first goal 
of the season: senior Mikki Offit, junior Angela Flister, 
sophomore Alex Puller and 
freshman Katharine Ham-er.
“It’s nice to be able to 
show our depth and get 
everybody a shot on the 
field,” sophomore Sammi Burgess said, “be-
cause there are a lot of games that certain people don’t get in, and it stinks because 
they’re working just as hard and they’re put-
ting in the work every single day at practice. 
“So for them to be able to get in there 
and get a couple goals, and really show what they have also is really important.”
Burgess was one of four players to score 
two goals on Wednesday — both before be-ing pulled after the Gators had built a com-fortable lead. 
Despite the dominant win, there was a 
downside to Florida's victory. 
Redshirt junior Nicole Graziano and fresh-
man Allie Pavinelli were both taken out of the game after each appeared to suffer hard shots to the head. Graziano’s injury occurred 
in the first half and she never returned from 
the locker room after halftime. Pavinelli was injured late in the game and was given a large bag of ice on the sidelines.
There was no update on the exact injury 
or condition of either player after the game.

LACROSSETHURSDAY, APRIL 16, 2015   ALLIGATOR   15  JUNIOR TA YLORE FULLER 
RECORDED TWO HITS 
AND FOUR RBIs.
By Patrick Pinak
Alligator Writer
@Pinakk12
It was only a matter of time 
before Taylore Fuller broke out of 
her slump.
Fuller, who had been 1-for-10 
in her last 10 at-bats, busted out of her skid and ripped a two-run double down the left-field line 
in the first inning against South 
Florida.
The junior led the way with 
two hits and four RBIs as No. 2 Florida (41-4) took down USF (32-
13) 7-0 Wednesday night at Katie 
Seashole Pressly Stadium.
“I’ve felt good. It just hasn’t 
happened for me,” Fuller said. “I 
feel like I’ve been hitting the ball 
solid. It just hasn’t fallen in, and finally I got a little luck on my side today.”
The Gators wasted little time 
getting on the scoreboard, putting up three runs in the bottom of the first.
Kelsey Stewart led off with a 
single to left field, which was fol-lowed by two strikeouts and two walks to Lauren Haeger and Kayli Kvistad to load the bases.
Then Fuller hit the two-run 
double before Justine McLean chopped an infield single to third base to score the third run.McLean went 3-for-3 with one 
RBI. The sophomore’s average now sits at .388.
USF’s defense looked sloppy 
in the third inning, allowing two runs to score on two errors to give Florida a 5-0 lead.
Pinch running for Haeger, 
Aleshia Ocasio scored from third on a throw from the Bulls’ catcher that sailed over the third baseman.
McLean followed with a single, 
and Fuller scored Florida’s fifth run after USF’s shortstop over-threw the first baseman. The Bulls committed four total 
errors throughout the game. 
“A couple of them were us forc-
ing the issue a little bit,” coach Tim Walton said. “They had to 
speed up what they wanted to do, 
and I think that kind of led to the mistakes.”
The Gators tacked on two more 
runs in the fourth inning on a bases-loaded single to left from Fuller.
Stewart extended her hitting 
streak to 12 games with her lead-
off single in the first. The Wichita, 
Kansas, native finished 2-for-4 and is hitting .533 during her hit streak.
“She’s been really good of late, 
and when she gets on base we score,” Walton said. 
Ocasio earned her 14th win in 
the circle, tossing four shutout in-
nings while striking out five.
Delanie Gourley earned her 
second save of the season, allow-
ing no runs in the last three in-
nings of the game. The sophomore 
struck out six and didn’t surrender a hit in her relief appearance. 
“Even if it was just a few in-
nings, it was good just to go out 
there and just be myself again,” 
Gourley said. 
The Gators will hit the road 
and travel to Athens, Georgia, to 
take on the Bulldogs Friday at 6 
p.m. to begin a three-game series. 
Georgia is 35-11 this season and 
11-7 in Southeastern Conference play.

day, saying they were shocked 
by the defense admission that Hernandez was at the scene of 
the killing — an acknowledge-
ment that they said helped con-ﬁ  rm that he was guilty.
They also described how the 
judge talked to them privately after they reached their decision and told them about other allega-tions and evidence not presented in the case, including the 2012 
slayings and the last texts Lloyd 
sent minutes before he died say-ing that said he was with “NFL.”
The jurors said that informa-
tion reafﬁ  rmed their feeling that they had made the right deci-sion.
In the Lloyd killing, the de-
fense argued that investigators 
ﬁ  xated on Hernandez because 
of his celebrity and conducted a shoddy investigation in their zeal to conﬁ  rm their suspicions.
Prosecutors said Hernandez 
organized the killing, summoned his two friends to help carry it out and drove Lloyd and the oth-ers to the secluded spot in the industrial park. During closing arguments, prosecutors also ac-cused Hernandez of pulling the 
trigger, though under the law it 
was not necessary to prove who ﬁ  red the shots to convict him.
Security video from inside 
Hernandez’s home showed him 
holding what appeared to be a 
gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd was killed. 
The surveillance system also 
captured Hernandez, Wallace and Ortiz relaxing at his home hours after Lloyd was shot, hanging out in the basement “man cave,” lounging by the 
pool and cuddling Hernandez’s 
baby daughter.
Lloyd’s sister, Olivia Thibou, 
said Wednesday that prosecu-
tors in the trial were her “dream 
team.”
Defense lawyers left the 
courthouse without comment-ing.
Hernandez, a native of Bris-
tol, Connecticut, was an All-American out of the University of Florida who was drafted by 
the Patriots in the fourth round
