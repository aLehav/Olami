AT UF’S TANGLEWOOD VILLAGE APARTMENTS.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Writer
A student was held at gunpoint 
at the east side of Tanglewood Vil-
lage Apartments, located on the 
southeast corner of UF campus, Sunday night.
At about 9:30 p.m., the male 
student was in the parking lot 
getting groceries out of his car 
when he was approached by a man armed with a small semi-automatic handgun, according to 
a press release from the UF police 
department.
The man demanded cash and 
all of the student’s belongings, the release stated. The student turned 
to face the man and offered him 
his car keys, but the man refused saying he didn’t want the car and 
again demanded cash, the release 
stated.
The student dropped his keys 
on the floor and ran away on foot, the release stated.
UPD, along with officers and 
police dogs from the Gainesville Police Department, searched the area but found no one. For now, 
UPD and GPD have assigned 
increased patrol 
units to the area, the release stated.
The robber is de-
scribed as a black man in his mid to late 20s, between 5’9” and 5’10” and around 210 to 215 pounds. He has a heavy build and short, 
close-cropped hair. He was wear-
ing long, dark colored pants and a dark shirt, the release stated. 
Anyone who thinks they might 
have seen the suspect or has been 
approached by someone similar is 
urged to call UPD.

back on duty after serving a “suspension” for an unprovoked at-
tack on a small schnauzer.
Sun Valley Police Chief Cameron Daggett says the 5-year-old 
German shepherd named Dax took a few weeks off the job after the incident. The dog will receive more training to prevent a reoc-currence of what Daggett says was an unfortunate situation.
Dax is a four-year veteran of the force. He is trained to find il-
legal drugs, missing people and evidence at crime scenes. 
On June 26, authorities say Dax attacked Max, a schnauzer. 
Max’s owner says the city is paying the $600 veterinarian bill.Idaho police dog back to work after suspension

LOCAL CRIME

Another pair of gas stations has 
fallen victim to the same credit card-
skimming scam that stole credit card 
information from customers of two Newberry Road gas stations earlier this month.
This time, two Kangaroo stations 
were hit. 
According to a Gainesville Police 
Department press release, the stations were located at 3424 SW Williston Road 
and 1255 W University Ave.
Two skimmers were found at each 
station.
“If you’ve used a gas pump any-
where in Alachua County and you’ve used your credit card, you’re at risk,” 
said Lt. Stephen Maynard, public infor-mation officer for the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. Credit card skimmers are hard drives 
that steal and store credit card informa-tion. Recently, three of these devices were found at the Shell and Sunoco sta-tions on Newberry Road, near the In-
terstate 75 exit. 
Maynard reiterated that the skim-
mer installations are the work of a na-
tional or even an international criminal organization. 
“It’s occurred all over the nation in 
almost every state,” he said.
A group that ran an operation simi-lar to the one that is terrorizing gas sta-
tions in Alachua County was recently 
busted in California, Maynard said. The identity thieves are suspected of buying up to $48 million worth of merchandise 
with the stolen credit card numbers.
Sheriff’s officers have no plans to 
guard the stations because they do not 
have the personnel to do so, he said. 
People who have been victimized by 
the skimmers should immediately no-tify law enforcement officials and their banks. 
“We’re obviously frustrated,” May-
nard said. “But we also recognize how difficult it is to catch this group of in-dividuals. We’re talking about an inter-national crime organization.”
Cpl. Tscharna Senn, public informa-
tion officer for the Gainesville Police Department, said they are currently investigating 20 to 25 cases related to credit card skimming.Skimmers found at 2 more gas stations

Colo. bear toots horn, takes 
car on short joyride 
DENVER — A bear got into an 
empty car, honked the horn and 
then sent it rolling 125 feet into a thicket, with the bear still inside, a Colorado family said.
Seventeen-year-old Ben Story 
said he and his family were asleep in their Larkspur home, 30 miles south of Denver, when the bear managed to open the unlocked door of his 2008 Toyota Corolla early Friday and climbed inside.
A peanut butter sandwich left 
on the back seat is probably what 
attracted the bear, Story said.
It’s not unusual for bears to 
open unlocked doors to cars and 
houses in search of food, said Ty-ler Baskfield, a spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
“It happens all the time,” he 
said. “They’re very smart.”
Once inside, the bear must 
have knocked the shifter on the au-tomatic transmission into neutral, sending the car rolling backward down the inclined driveway and into the thicket, Story said.
The door probably slammed 
shut when the car jolted to a stop, he said, trapping the bear inside.
Neighbors had called 911, and 
deputies freed the bear by opening the door with a rope from a dis-tance. It then ran into the woods.
Story said he’ll need a new car 
because the bear trashed the interi-or while apparently trying to find a way out.
The bear also left what Story 
called “a present” on the driver’s 
seat.
“A nice pile, actually,” added 
his dad, Ralph. “Something to re-
member.”

2 bodies found floating in 
central Fla. lake 
TAVARES — Two bodies 
have been found floating in a 
central Florida lake after an all-
day search for the missing swim-mers.
Authorities identified the vic-
tims as 56-year-old Jerry Reyes of Colorado Springs, Colo., and 60-year-old Richard Cronister of Leesburg, Fla.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission says the bodies were found Sunday in Lake Harris, which is about 30 miles north of Orlando. Two dozen rescuers covered nearly 35 square miles of the lake in search for the men.
Authorities say Reyes jumped 
off a boat and went for a swim 
Saturday afternoon but strug-
gled in the water. Cronister and Reyes’ brother jumped in to help save him. When Reyes’ brother could not find the two other men, he swam to shore for help.

Four UF faculty members studied 
the Gulf oil spill from four angles: tour-
ism, ocean flow, marine ecosystems and 
the legal aspects of the oil spill cleanup.
The UF Alumni Association is host-
ing a panel of these four researchers to-
day to discuss what UF is doing about the April 20 Deepwater Horizon explo-sion.
The event, titled “An academic per-
spective on the Oil in the Gulf,” will be held today at the Emerson Alumni Hall 
in Room 215 and is expected to last from 
noon until 1:30 p.m. It is open to the public. Each speaker will have 20 min-utes to speak followed by a 15-minute Q-and-A session.
“The first goal was to make sure the 
speakers had very diverse backgrounds on the spill,” said R.J. Stamper, an event spokesman. “The main purpose of the 
event is to show UF alumni and friends 
what the university is doing about the oil spill,” he said. 
Tourism professor Stephen Holland 
has done research on other disasters. He points out that while tourism decreases in some ways after disasters, it can also increase from people interested in see-ing the disaster firsthand.
For example, surfers rush to the coast 
when a hurricane  approaches, he said.
The other speakers are Tom Frazer, 
a marine ecology pro-fessor; Peter Sheng, a coastal engineering professor; and Thomas Ruppert, an environ-
mental law assistant.
Frazer studies how the oil affects ma-
rine ecology. Sheng is researching how currents and climates affect the oil’s 
movement. Ruppert works with Florida 
Sea Grant’s post-disaster recovery plan-ning.
“The important things to remember 
is that the effects of the oil spill are go-ing to be potentially very long lasting,” Frazer said.

It’s been about a month since UF’s 
campus-wide tobacco ban went into effect, 
and so far it doesn’t seem like much has 
changed.
The ban, effective since July 1, is in-
tended to promote healthy lifestyles on 
campus and discourage the use of any to-bacco products, even smokeless tobacco like snuff or electronic cigarettes. 
All students, faculty, visitors and con-
struction workers are within the ban’s breadth.
However, while that seems all encom-
passing, the ban has one major flaw — it’s difficult to enforce.
Capt. Jeff Holcomb, public information 
officer for the UF police department, said it’s hard to gauge the ban’s effectiveness because it’s not punishable like a law, but remains just a policy.
“I haven’t heard any uproar about it 
from either side, either negative or posi-tive,” Holcomb said. “So, hopefully that means people are complying.”
Frankie Tai, a secretary at the UF Stu-
dent Health Care Center, said there was an influx of people signing up for smoking 
cessation courses in the weeks leading up 
to July 1, but said it didn’t last.
“I think it was the big scare that it was 
going into effect, but things have leveled out now,” Tai said.
While some students and employees 
cross University Avenue for their smoke breaks, others, without fear of reprimand, just stay where they are.
“I just don’t see the real validity to the 
whole ban. There’s nothing they can do,” said Matt Watts, a junior journalism stu-dent who sat smoking in front of Weimer Hall.
“Who’s really gonna say something to 
you, as long as you’re respectable,” he said. “I’ll continue to smoke on campus until Bernie Machen himself says don’t do it.”Smokers still smokingExperts to discuss oil spill

Gainesville residential parking decals and permits 
will be available for purchase online beginning Mon-
day. 
Decals and permits purchased online will be mailed 
to the property owner or property manager for the resi-
dents to pick up, according to a city press release. 
Bob Woods, spokesman for the City of Gainesville, 
said there is a grace period of six weeks for residents to 
get the $18.50 decal, ending on Sept. 11. 
Applicants must prove residency within one of the 
eight controlled parking zones. 
Woods said one reason the parking decal and permit 
program was implemented is to provide better parking for residents surrounding the campus area. 
“This system was put in place to begin to address is-
sues regarding a lack of apartment parking availability, particularly with a large influx of people coming in for various activities on the UF campus, like football games and graduation,” Woods said. 
Students living in UF sorority and fraternity houses 
may also purchase residential decals online, provided UF submits the official member lists to the city. Decals 
purchased online will be mailed to the house director of 
each chapter house.
Jack Causseaux, associate director for the Office of 
Sorority & Fraternity Affairs, said that all chapter presi-dents had to update their rosters of current members on Friday. 
“We send over a list of who lives in each house, and 
from there they are able to purchase the decals,” Caus-seaux said.  
Causseaux sent the updated list to the City of 
Gainesville on Monday. Sorority and fraternity members who do not live in-
house are also able to purchase a lunch decal, allowing them to park in the city for lunchtime hours. 
Residents in the Controlled Vehicular Parking Zones 
will be able to purchase decals online at cityofgainesville.org.
If residents have any questions, they can call the park-
ing decal office at 352-334-5024, Monday through Thurs-day from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 27, 2010

MIAMI — Democratic Senate candidate Kendrick Meek 
is running his first television ad, attacking billionaire Jeff 
Greene, as a Florida newcomer and former Republican who profited when the housing market collapsed.
The Miami congressman’s ad comes after Greene has 
spent two months running ads, allowing him to move from an unknown to even with Meek in the polls leading up to the Aug. 24 primary. Meek’s 30-second ad is entitled “Meet the Real Jeff Greene” and is a takeoff on one of Greene’s first ads, “Meet Jeff Greene,” that portrayed him as a political outsider who would fight career politicians like Meek.
Meek’s ad attacks Greene for running for Congress in 
California as a Republican, moving to Florida only two years ago and for investing in credit default swaps that made him 
hundreds of millions of dollars when the mortgage market 
collapsed starting a few years ago.
In the ad, Greene “became a billionaire 
on Wall Street betting middle-class families 
would lose their homes,” the narrator says. 
“Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffett called Greene’s scheme ‘financial weapons of mass destruction.’”
Greene ran as a Republican in a 1982 California congres-
sional race, losing in the primaries, and made Florida his 
official residence in 2008. But Buffett, the legendary investor 
who is the country’s second-richest person, was referring to credit default swaps generally and not Greene’s specific investment in that quote, made originally in 2003.
The ad ends with a video clip of Greene, referring to his 
friendships with troubled celebrities like boxer Mike Tyson and Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, saying, “They’ll attack me for my friends and past when I was single. Some of it is true but none of that matters.”
The Meek-Greene winner will face Republican Marco 
Rubio and Gov. Charlie Cristin the November general elec-tion.Meek launches

SENT THE COMMON EXPERIENCE 
THE 6,400-MEMBER CLASS SHARES WHILE AT UF.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
They are white, black, Asian and His-
panic. They are rich, and they are poor. 
They come from all over the United 
States. 
They are the UF class of 2014. Forty of them will represent the 
6,400-member class in the “Dawoud Bey: First-Year Florida Project” photography exhibition at the Harn Museum of Art, located at Southwest 34th Street and Hull 
Road. 
Photographer Dawoud Bey is taking 
posed portraits of incoming UF freshmen 
in an attempt to show that a largely diverse 
group of young adults is united by their 
common experience of starting at UF. 
Pairs of students are photographed at 
different locations throughout campus, in-cluding dorms, libraries and classrooms. 
“On one hand, this is a very small sam-
ple of the class of 2014,” said Tom South-all, curator of photography at the Harn 
Museum. “Ideally, it will also 
represent the diversity of the 
class and suggest something about the experience of a 
freshman — their hopes and fears.” 
During his two-week stay in Gainesville 
Bey will photograph up to 100 students. 
The  20 best photographs will be exhib-
ited at the museum from Oct. 5 through Jan. 2. Ten of them will remain in the mu-seum’s permanent collection. 
“This will be something very special to 
the class of 2014, but also people who have graduated 50 years ago will be interested 
in this slice of life of the 2014 class,” South-
all said. 
UF freshmen who are interested in hav-
ing their portrait taken can e-mail photo@
harn.ufl.edu. Males are encouraged to par-
ticipate in order to diversify Bey’s photo subjects, since mainly females have volun-teered so far.Photographer to capture freshman class’s diversity

The Studio Percussion’s music 
room is a noisy place.
Drum sets, bongos and hand 
drums clutter the space at the non-
profit music school on the corner of Northwest Sixth Street and 10th Avenue. But amid Friday night’s usual cacophony of grunts, bangs and crashes, none of the instru-ments made so much as a mumble.
Instead, the noise came from 
five UF architecture seniors, who were pushing, kicking and pound-ing together a minivan-sized jig-saw puzzle. The five students, who called themselves “Recreate 121,” designed, built and donated a near-ly 8-foot-tall kiosk to the Studio Percussion music school. The kiosk will serve as a business counter and storage place for the studio.
Before it went to the music room, 
however, the Recreate 121 team as-sembled the kiosk on the Plaza of the Americas on Friday, where it stayed from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The kiosk was constructed out of 
recycled and reclaimed materials. A large portion came from old UF studio desks destined for disposal. 
Only $60 worth of non-recycled 
desk materials were used to build seven surfboard-sized pieces that were assembled into the kiosk.
“There were 12-hour days work-
ing on the project,” said Breanna Rossman, one of the builders. “We came up with the idea near the end of April and have been working to-ward finishing since then.”
After spending two months 
gathering materials and construct-ing the kiosk, Rossman, along with fellow students Dylan Rinda, Kyle Altman, Jeff Glad and Nicole Paul, finally finished and installed their summer project at its new home at the music school.
Studio Percussion was founded eight years ago by Tobin and Jill Wagstaff, who were  members of the featured family on the “Ex-treme Makeover: Home Edition” TV show in February.
Although their house got a 
makeover, the studio where they give free drum lessons six days a week did not, Tobin said.
“I kind of felt like I did when the 
Extreme Makeover people came to our house,” he said. “It’s wonderful to see someone take the time and effort to help us. It’s been amazing to see them design and build some-thing and then just give it away.”

Thursday’s question: Do you think college athletes should be paid? 25% YES75% NO
183TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Will you study at the Reitz Union?Study Session 
Starting in the fall, the 
Hub will no longer be the official on-campus 
late-night study center, with those duties being taken over 
by the Reitz Union, which 
will remain open until 3 a.m. — along with Taco Bell, Star-bucks and possibly Subway.
We think it makes a lot 
of sense to shift the late-night hours away from the Hub, but instead of the Reitz Union, how about extend-
ing hours for, say, a library? 
Even one of the smaller ones would work fine.
As it stands, this is a use-
less transition. SG voted to take away one late-night “study center” without any kind of study materials on site and replace it with anoth-
er equally under-equipped 
venue to host a cram session.
Rather than providing 
a venue for actual study-ing, this just reeks of an SG-backed way for people liv-ing or parking on campus to get drunk food during their march home from Midtown at 2 a.m.
We enjoy getting our 
fourth meal on as much as anyone, but we’d be hard pressed to say the ability to 
buy a Baja Blast at 2 a.m. is 
as important as being able to check out a book we never bought right before a test.
According to SG, the 
move is supposed to pro-vide safer parking and save the university $35,000 in the midst of a budget crunchg, 
which is commendable, but 
we already have a use for some of that money that would allow us to have our burrito and eat it too: take half of it and pay a couple student employees to keep one of the smaller libraries, equipped with computers 
and – dare we say it, books 
– open into the wee hours of the morning.
It’s a radical idea, and ap-
parently a novel concept to the SG crowd, but at least there would be a viable op-tion for people who actually want to study at 2 a.m.War Torn
Leaked reports killed 
America’s trust
The Department of Defense would have us think that na-tional security is no joke, but a quick look at the more than 90,000 leaked reports from the war in Afghanistan 
showed us that honesty and integrity is somewhat of a laugh-ing matter.
The reports didn’t contain anything all too shocking. We’ve 
been primed to suspect Iran and Pakistan of colluding with the Taliban against U.S. forces, and we’ve heard more than a few tales of wrongful killings of civilians during the war. What stings is how cavalier our government has been in lying to us for the past several years under a thin guise of protecting us and the war effort.
We would love for a representative of the coalition forces 
to look us in the eyes and tell us why gunning down 15 un-
armed civilians in a bus had to be kept secret. It certainly isn’t 
an effective way to make amends with the families of the de-ceased.
Maybe they could also explain the kill- or capture -without- 
trial policy they have over there. Last time we checked we had fought hard to get every last person – scumbag or not – the right to a fair trial. Apparently that was all one big PR stunt.
No matter who was president back in 2001, there is no ques-
tion that we would have ended up fighting a war in Afghani-
stan. It was justified and easy to get public backing for it.
Flashfoward to 2010, and all of our worst suspicions about 
the war are coming true. Maybe we are being naive and should 
have seen this coming all along, but the truth is out. And it has more than a few bad things to say about how the war is being handled over there.
Guest column
Add cursing to list of bad habits to quit
I was passing through Midtown last Tuesday evening, 
and I stopped to watch the live music at The Swamp for a song or two. “Cause it’s the first of May, first of 
May,” he sang, and I was thinking what a nice voice he had when suddenly – “Outdoor f--king starts today. Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called f--king outside” – my heart started pounding as nervous anger flooded my 
insides. He dropped the  F-bomb in his beautiful melody. 
As he scanned the audience, his eyes met mine. I felt un-comfortable just witnessing this performance. Maybe I was overreacting, I thought. I decided I’d try to wait it out, hoping the next song would be swear-free and worth stay-
ing for. He had a good voice. “I’m going to make this part 
as vulgar as possible,” he said, and I cringed. I instantly began to change my mind about staying. He said some-thing about “f--king everybody,” and I couldn’t stand lis-
tening anymore. I left — no applause from me tonight. 
I walked away embarrassed and upset by what I had 
heard. I realized that I am not desensitized to profanity. 
At 21 years old, the words still sting my ears. Yes, I went to public middle and high schools and rode the bus and 
heard my share of foul language from a young age. Yes, 
I’ve watched R-rated movies. And yes, I have friends who curse. But it still bothers me. Beyond not liking it, I am of-fended by it. I suppose there is a reason Merriam-Webster 
describes cursing as obscene language – that which is ta-
boo, impolite, disgusting to the senses, repulsive and ab-horrent to morality or virtue.
As you could probably guess, I don’t curse. To me, 
curse words are dirty, cruel, harsh and unnecessary. As a 
journalist, I believe words are very powerful and should 
be used wisely and well. Some may say that cursing is the only effective way to make a point, but I disagree. I think non-expletives can be just as pow-erful, if not more specific. 
To me, hearing a curse word is 
like catching a glimpse of roadkill 
as I’m driving – it’s over quickly, but it leaves a bad feel-ing in my stomach and a sour taste in my mouth. I prefer to avoid it.
You can imagine how tortured I felt when I attended 
my first Tutoring Zone session last semester, and Matt littered the hours-long business finance review sessions with F-words. It distracted me from the lesson. It angered me. And several of my friends agreed that the cursing at 
Tutoring Zone was over-the-top and upsetting.
If someone drops a hammer on their toe and they mut-
ter “s--t,” I’m a bit more understanding. Sometimes it’s au-
tomatic, unintentional or uncontrollable. That’s fine. But 
when people consciously make it a point to insert swear 
words into their conversations, presentations or music, I don’t think there is a justified excuse for it. I know some people are going for the shock factor, desperately trying get an audience’s attention or think it makes them sound 
“cool,” but those excuses are pretty lousy. They just don’t 
cut it for me.
Although some people may snicker at my sensitivity 
and my refusal to curse, I hope someone out there respects 
it. I’ve heard plenty of people say they want to give up 
cursing. Slipping expletives into your daily conversations might have become your bad habit long ago, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be broken. At the very least, I wish men would hold their tongues around women. I think it’s 
an all-too-rare gesture of respect to mind your tongue for 
the sake of others.

Speaking OutTUESDAY, JULY 27, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Last Thursday’s column 
“Make up your own mind about politics” inspired 
me.
Up until now, talk radio, Faux 
News and Dove World Outreach Center have been controlling 
my ideals because I’ve been too 
afraid to speak out.
Bryan Griffin changed all 
that.
I will no longer accept uber-
conservative, we-hate-everyone-so-it’s-not-discrimination beliefs any longer. 
I will finally speak my mind 
and not let my fear of war-mon-gering talk show hosts stop me.
I will stand up for my com-
mie-pinko friends out there (if you exist).
It’s tough to be a Stalin-loving 
commie when all your history professors insist on pushing their capitalistic bias on you by only 
teaching the bad side of the So-
viet Union. (Forget Russian lit-erature, why don’t we have a class dedicated to 1970s Russian hockey?) 
And it’s not like I, as a self-
professed pinko lover, would want to open my mind to an op-posing viewpoint in the class-
room. Heavens no. 
That would be the equivalent 
of making an American watch 
the USA vs. Algeria match, only to find that soccer may not be the world’s  dullest  sport (con-
gratula-
tions curl-ing, that title now 
belongs to 
you).
This is why I want to urge my 
fellow UF students to speak my mind. 
Don’t be afraid to let me brain-
wash you into only agreeing with what I say and then calling it free speech.
As Griffin says, professors 
only live in a world of learning and an “ideological world of pa-per-applicable theory.” 
Don’t let their book learnin’ 
influence you. Instead, let your 18 to 22 years of experience liv-ing at home and maybe having a minimum wage job be the sole 
source of your political beliefs. 
Or, if you really want to be a 
good communist like me, join a 
Russian factory for a few five-year plans that will put you on 
the fast track to success. You can 
only learn by rejecting academia’s blatant anti-communist bias.
Thank you, Bryan Griffin. If it 
weren’t for you, I never would’ve had the courage to write that load of Bolshevik. 
Andrew Pantazi is a journalism 
senior.
Last Thursday’s top story, “Faculty 
search raises questions” concerned the inability of the College of Journalism 
and Communications to even interview a pro-fessional journalist with 25 years of experience at The New York Times for a very hands-on and professional opening within the college 
for next year. 
The reason: He does not have an advanced 
degree.
This position is not a regular tenure-track 
professorship where the expectations are for 
a Ph.D and the ability to conduct “scholarly research.” The job title is Executive Produc-er/Managing Editor 21st Century News Lab. 
How many executive producers in television 
news or managing editors of newspapers have advanced degrees?
The reason why the college cannot even 
interview this person is because Provost Joe Glover would not waive the requirement that faculty must have advanced degrees. Yet later he says, “in some fields, professional experi-ence is equally important.” If there ever was 
a position where professional experience is 
more than equally important, this is it.
The great irony in this story is that the “fa-
ther” of this college did not have an advanced 
degree; in fact, he had no college degree. But 
he came from New York with a huge amount of professional experience.
When the decision was made in the late 
1940s to consulate journalism education in Florida at UF, the newspaper editors in the 
state pressed for a person with hands-on expe-
rience to build a top professional program to train journalists. 
Rae O. Weimer became the director of the 
new School of Journalism in 1949. A top profes-
sional program resulted in the college’s WRUF 
being the radio news leader in Gainesville, WUFT producing the area’s first local televi-
sion news program, the old Florida Alligator being staffed entirely by 
journalism majors and even The Gainesville 
Sun being produced by 
print majors two days a week. Every person Rae Weimer hired had 
professional experience, 
or they were not even 
interviewed.
Because of that standard, the College of 
Journalism and Communications became the 
highest nationally ranked college within its 
field of any UF college. And it still is.
Critics may argue that 1949 was a long time 
ago, and UF’s national reputation has gone 
from a sleepy Southern state school to a highly 
regarded major university.
I was hired as an “interim instructor” by 
Weimer in the spring of 1968. As far as I can tell, I am the only person left teaching in the 
college who was hired by him. It is now 2010, 
and 42 years later I am still teaching basic re-porting the way Rae Weimer wanted it taught. Maybe 1949 isn’t that far back.
The need for professionally trained journal-
ists is the same now. Journalism is not a pro-fession, but it certainly is not a “trade” as one ill-informed journalism major said. Journalism schools stopped being trade schools sometime 
in the 1960s. 
Students in this college need courses taught 
by people with strong experience in the field. Having an advanced degree in, say, English or 
sociology does nothing to improve the learn-ing experience UF can provide.
It is wonderful that the leaders of UF today 
push to make this great university a true na-tional leader. But doing so by a set formula in-stead of using common sense makes no sense.

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG alligatorSports.org UF VOLLEYBALLRecruits shine at 
Friday Night Lights

Under a clear summer night 
sky in front of UF coaches and 
with several current Florida players watching on from the 
stands, some of the state’s top 
recruits took the field for Friday Night Lights in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Friday.
Before the camp even got 
started, though, Friday was already a big day for Florida’s football team. Four-star Dover, Del., offensive lineman Trip 
Thurman committed to the 
Gators early Friday followed by a commitment from Pensa-cola Pine Forest defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy, who ran a 4.38 40-yard dash at a camp at UAB.
The two recruits upped 
Florida’s total to 12 for the 2011 
class.
But that was just the begin-
ning of a busy Friday for the 
Gators.
At the sixth annual Friday 
Night Lights camp, some of the state’s top recruits – including a handful of UF commits such as four-star athlete De’Ante “Pop” Saunders, fullback Hunter Joyer, tight end A.C. Leonard and defensive lineman Jeoffrey Pagan – and other recruits from around the nation took part in 
position drills, one-on-one drills 
and spent time getting coached up by Florida coaches and for-mer players.
Although many big names 
were in attendance, one was noticeably absent: five-star ath-lete James Wilder Jr. of Tampa’s Plant High.
Wilder, who has UF among 
his top choices, was visiting FSU on Friday and was still expected to make it to 
Friday Night Lights, but never 
showed.
Of the recruits who were 
there, many impressed, includ-
ing four-star running backs Mike Blakely (Manatee) and Mike Bellamy (Charlotte).
While Bellamy, a Clemson 
commit, said he is “100 percent Clemson,” Blakely put Florida 
at the top of his list of schools.

The NCAA looks powerless.
It could only do so much in attempting 
to solve the problems agents are causing, which have recently caused a whirlwind 
around Florida’s football program.
This is where the NFL and the NFL Play-
ers Association (NFLPA) step in. 
Alabama coach Nick Saban made a threat 
to the NFL only after saying he believes that 
agents should have their license revoked for a year if they are found to affect the eligibil-ity of a student-athlete. 
“If something doesn’t go on from their 
end of it to control what they’re doing to af-fect our players, then I’m not sure that the same hospitality will be welcomed in the fu-ture,” Saban said.The NFL is quickly being dragged into the 
problem and it will soon have to respond.
Some punishments the league and the 
players association could implement are to revoke or suspend an agent’s license or even 
to punish the guilty play-ers.
At this time, players 
can get away unscathed if they make a jump to the NFL. But not if the  league held them out of games on their professional team.
Others are calling for 
the government to get in-
volved.
“What we have to remember is that the 
NFLPA and the NCAA, they lack the same kind of penalties that the state and federal Coaches calling upon NFLSEE RECRUIT , pAGE 16
UF BASKETBALL

On Friday, coach Billy Donovan an-
nounced that center Kenny Kadji has 
decided to transfer from Florida.
Kadji received a medical redshirt 
last season because of a back injury. He is the 14th basketball player to transfer from UF since 2003.
“While I’m sad that my time here 
at Florida is ending, UF will always be special to me,” Kadji said. “I have goals that I hope to reach and only a 
short window of my life to make those 
things happen.”
The 6-foot-10-inch center averaged 
just 3.7 points and 2.3 rebounds per 
contest in 42 games at UF.
Freshman Patric Young, a five-star 
recruit, was expected to take some playing time away from Kadji this season. Young and sophomore Erik 
Murphy will be even more vital to the team, as they will be the lone front-
court reserve options on the Gators next season.
Kadji would have entered the 2010-
11 campaign as a redshirt sophomore. He only appeared in eight games last season because of the injury.
“Kenny has made a decision that 
it’s in his best interest to start new somewhere else,” Donovan said. “He’s still recovering from back surgery and working hard to get himself healthy. I wish him the best in his future.”
The transfer leaves Erving Walker 
as the only remaining player from UF’s five-man 2008 recruiting class, which Rivals.com ranked 10th in the nation.
Kadji’s new school is unknown.Kadji transfers from UFRecruiting

UF four-star verbal commit A.C. Leonard, left, was one of three tight ends that used UF’s 
sixth annual Friday Night Lights camp to impress coaches. 
UF near top for Waisome, Johnson
“If they run the ball and win games … I’m 
here,” Blakely said. “As long as the running 
back gets the ball, (the offense) doesn’t mat-ter.”
On the defensive side of the ball, Deland’s 
Saunders, who worked as a defensive back, and Groveland’s South Lake four-star corner-back Nick Waisome stood out, showing good speed and form in drills.
Waisome said he built good relationships 
with Florida’s coaches during his visit, but will wait until sometime in August to make his decision.
“I know where I’m leaning, but I’m prob-
ably going to sit down with my parents and talk things over,” Waisome said.
He added that his top-five schools are UF, 
FSU, South Carolina, Georgia and LSU – in no particular order.Linebacker A.J. Johnson, of Gainesville, 
Ga., also impressed those in attendance dur-ing one-on-one drills showing good speed while covering the running backs. Afterward, he said UF was in his top three, along with Tennessee and Clemson, but that UF was his leading choice.
PAGAN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT
Although it seemed four-star defensive 
lineman Jeoffrey Pagan was wavering on his commitment to Florida last month when he told the Asheville Citizen-Times he was close to 50 percent committed to the Gators, he so-
lidified his verbal to UF after Friday Night 
Lights.
Pagan said he spoke to Meyer during his 
visit and ultimately decided that he would not be taking any official visits once the sea-son starts because of the respect he and Meyer have for each other.RECRUIT , from page 15
government could put forth,”sports 
agent and CEO of Dynasty Athlete Rep-resentation Darren Heitner said. 
“The NFLPA can revoke a license, 
but as an agent what are you more 
afraid of – the players association re-
voking your license or going to jail for 15 years?”
The NFLPA already forces agents to 
undergo the strictest process out of any sport to become certified to represent one of its athletes. 
It is the only league that requires 
applicants to possess a post-graduate degree. Furthermore, the players asso-ciation forces agents to pay an annual 
fee of  $1,200 and pass an exam on the 
league’s collective bargaining agree-ment.
In the MLB an agent just has to have 
clean background while representing a player on a 40-man roster to become certified.
Still, Heitner believes the NFL can 
do more.
“They have stricter criteria for en-
trance,” he said. “Once you become a part of the NFLPA as a registered agent, that’s when it really matters what they are doing.”NFL most strict on new agents

But when it came time to show off for 
Florida’s coaches and their fellow campers,  
it was the tight ends that stole the spotlight in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
There was no doubt heading into the 
camp that the tight ends would impress, with both the No. 2 (Nick O’Leary) and No. 6 overall (A.C. Leonard) tight ends in the 
nation, according to Rivals.com, on hand.
Leonard, who already committed to the 
Gators, looked good during the camp and 
impressed those watching on.
“He’s phenomenal, he’s going to be 
great. I think he’s definitely going to make it to the next level,” said Nick Waisome, a four-star cornerback prospect from Grove-land’s South Lake, who covered Leonard 
during drills.
Leonard reiterated his oral commitment 
to UF but also said he spent some of the 
camp trying to recruit other players to com-mit, though he didn’t give specific names.
O’Leary, from Palm Beach Gardens’ 
Dwyer, garnered much attention from Flor-ida’s coaches Friday. He has yet to commit to a school, though UF remains in the hunt.
Coach Urban Meyer spent a lot of time 
talking to, and recruiting, O’Leary early in the night while the players were doing position drills, and then Meyer looked on 
from the endzone while O’Leary and Leon-
ard competed in one-on-one drills later in the evening.
O’Leary ran crisp routes, showed good 
speed and had some nice catches, including one over his left shoulder for a touchdown during one-on-ones, however, he did drop a few balls late. 
The surprise standout among the group 
was Junior Pome’e, a three-star hybrid 
wide receiver and tight end from Moreno Valley’s Ran-cho Verde High (Calif.) who is committed to UCLA.
Pome’e was all over the 
field, doing work with run-ning backs during position 
drills, and  with wide receivers and tight 
ends later in the night. 
His performance earned the attention 
of Meyer, who spoke to him at the end of 
camp.
“I just balled out and had fun, that’s all I 
wanted to do,” Pome’e said.
Even though he is committed to the 
Bruins, he spoke highly of Florida and his relationship with current Gators defensive 
lineman Ronald Powell. However, UF has 
yet to offer him a scholarship.TEs steal show at camp; Leonard solid on Gators
