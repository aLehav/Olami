“This is your day of reckoning.”
Those were the words Judge James Colaw said as he sen-
tenced Pedro Bravo to life in prison — with no chance of pa-
role — for murdering UF student Christian Aguilar.
“While Christian Aguilar may have been beyond the pro-
tection of the law on Sept. 20, 2012, you are not beyond its 
justice,” Colaw said.
After almost four hours of deliberation, 
the jury found Bravo, a former Santa Fe College student, guilty of the ﬁ  rst-degree 
murder of his friend. The state suggested 
the murder was driven by Bravo’s jealousy. Shortly after a turbulent breakup with his high school love, Erika Friman, she and 
Aguilar had begun dating.
Throughout the two-week trial, the state 
presented 26 witnesses and a total of 1,010 pieces of evidence. The defense had one witness — Bravo.
Bravo may not contact Friman or any member of the Agui-
lar family ever again.
Colaw gave Bravo an additional 46 years for the other 
charges, which included false imprisonment, poisoning, two counts of lying to police and the improper transportation of human remains.
Bravo took the stand to declare his innocence.“It doesn’t matter what anyone says. I know in my heart 
what I did. I did not kill my friend,” he told the court.
The closing remarks of the defense relied heavily on blam-
ing police for an inept investigation, especially concerning searching the parking lot of Streit’s Motorsports, 4820 NW 13th St., where Bravo said he fought Aguilar and left him for dead.
“There was zero effort looking for a sign of a struggle, 
absolutely zero,” said Michael Ruppert, of the defense. “For these ofﬁ  cers to get up here and say they made a genuine ef-fort is wrong.”
The state had evidence showing Bravo’s exact purchases, 
Internet searches and locations from the weeks around the murder.
The defense agreed with every point except the ﬁ  nal cell-
phone location data, which the state said showed Bravo head-ing west on Archer Road, toward Levy County.BEATRICE DUPUY

With football student lottery sea-
son ticket sales at an all-time low, UF 
students gathered Sunday for the ﬁ  rst “Rally in the Swamp” event at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
The UF Alumni Association and 
the University Athletic Association teamed up to host the pep rally, which brought together about 6,500 students to the stadium the night before Fall classes kicked off. They hoped students would buy up to 1,500 unsold lottery season tickets, the most left over in decades.
“It’s the ﬁ  rst time we haven’t sold 
out since 1979,” said Travis Leyn-dyke, director of ticket operations at UF Athletic Association. He said the event was an attempt to connect students with UF athletes and boost student ticket sales.
The event featured UF football 
head coach Will Muschamp, UF Dazzlers and mascots Albert and

When the basement of Marston Science Library 
reopens to students Wednesday, few — if any — 
will recognize the space.
Since the basement was blocked off in May, 
about $5.7 million worth of renovations have turned the room from dimly lit storage for crusty old doc-uments to a high-tech study space ﬁ  t for 701 stu-
dents.
“Hopefully, some students can now abandon the 
ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union where they were studying 
and move in here,” UF Provost Joe Glover said.
The 20,000-square-foot basement features color-
coded zones, denoting places designed for group study, computer stations and individuals. Study and conference rooms are named after scientists, 
including UF’s own Robert Cade, who developed 
Gatorade. 
There are two special features: the Made@UF 
room, which will be used to teach people how to develop apps, and a conference room featuring a gi-
ant, 5-foot-by-10-foot touch screen monitor. 
Adam Brown, the operations manager for the 
Ofﬁ  ce of Academic Technology, said the scheduled 
timing to open for Fall 2014 semester was just right. 
Glover agreed, adding that it was done on bud-
get.
A ceremony celebrating the basement’s renova-
tions will be held Wednesday at 10 a.m.Marston basement to reopen Wed.Bravo

Bishop: Slain US journalist Foley 
opened our eyes 
ROCHESTER, N.H. — Slain U.S. journalist James Foley was living his faith by bringing im-
ages to people suffering from 
war and oppressive regimes, a Roman Catholic bishop said Sunday at a Mass in Foley’s honor.Bishop Peter Libasci said even after Foley was captured for the first time in Libya in 2011, he “went back again that we might 
open our eyes.”
Foley’s parents and hundreds of others attended the Mass in his hometown of Rochester, New Hampshire. Afterward, Libasci read aloud a letter from 
the Vatican extending the con-
dolences of Pope Francis.The crowd filled every pew, and people stood three deep at the back of the church and along both sides of it. Gov. Maggie Hassan, along with U.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, attended the Mass.
Foley was kidnapped on 
Thanksgiving Day 2012 while covering the Syrian uprising. The Islamic State group posted a web video Tuesday showing his killing and said it was in retaliation for U.S. air strikes in northern Iraq.In a packed Our Lady of the 
Holy Rosary church, the bishop 
frequently addressed Foley’s parents and stressed their son’s connection to their family. He also prayed for another captive journalist, Steven Sotloff, and all captives.“Jim went back again that we might open our eyes,” Libasci 
said. “That we might indeed know how precious is this 
gift. May almighty God grant 
peace to James and to all our 
fragile world.”A funeral for Foley will be held Oct. 18, what would have been his 41st birthday.The U.S. government said Sunday that Peter Theo Curtis of Massachusetts, a journal-ist who was held hostage 
for about two years by an al-
Qaida-linked group in Syria, was released. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis, who wrote under the byline Theo Padnos, is now safe outside of Syria.At a vigil Saturday night in 
Rochester, about 200 people 
gathered to show support for the Foley family.“We are honored that you care and love Jim. We are honored that you recognized the sacrifices he made,” John Foley said. “He loved the Syrian people. He was devot-
ed to telling their story and 
doing whatever he could to help their fight.”The world’s largest bloc of Islamic nations denounced Foley’s “heinous” killing and reiterated its support for in-ternational efforts to confront the Islamic State fighters.
Iyad Madani, chief of the 
Organization of Islamic Cooperation, said in a state-ment Saturday that the ac-tions of the Islamic State group have nothing to do with the values of Islam or his organization’s founding principles of tolerance and co-
existence.

Michael Brown called ‘little kid 
in big body’ 
FERGUSON, Mo. — Michael Brown Jr. was on the verge of starting college, eager to launch himself into the adult world. Instead, he’ll be mourned at his funeral 
Monday, more than two 
weeks after his fatal shooting by a white police officer — an act that ignited days of vio-lent protests and reawakened racial tensions that still linger in the nation.Brown, who was unarmed when he was killed, became 
an instant symbol of racial 
injustice as protesters flooded into the streets after his death. Civil rights leaders said the shooting in this predomi-nantly black St. Louis sub-urb revived long simmering questions about police treat-ment of minorities across the 
country.
Even as the details of what happened during the Aug. 9 confrontation remain unclear, a portrait has emerged of the 18-year-old Brown.

Leyndyke said he would 
like to see the rally become a 
UF tradition.
The Gator Ticket Ofﬁ  ce 
opened up for student ticket 
distribution at the rally, where students could also pick up their 2014 Pepsi Student Section T-shirt. The ﬁ  rst 3,000 attendees received free pizza.
In a recent email to students, 
UF athletics director Jeremy Fo-ley encouraged students to en-
ter in the football lottery.
Some students, like 21-year-
old Matt Duggar, who attended 
the rally, said he thought the decline in sales was because of UF’s last football season. But that didn’t stop him from enter-ing in the lottery this year.
Duggar, a UF industrial sys-
tems engineering junior, said he picked up his block seating tickets at the rally.
Megan Giese, a 19-year-old 
UF applied physiology and ki-nesiology sophomore, said she almost did not participate in the student lottery this season.
“I’m happy I got them,” she 
said. “Being a Gator means you have to go to the games.”Lowest ticket sales

The defense said Bravo was actually 
heading northeast to attempt to commit 
suicide.In a press conference after the sentenc-
ing, the Aguilar family spoke brieﬂ  y.
“Today is when we start healing,” said 
Christian’s brother, Alexander Aguilar.
Carlos Aguilar said although he had 
been willing to forgive Bravo, he cannot do so until Bravo admits his guilt. 
The Aguilars’ statements to the press 
echoed the words of Judge Colaw during 
Bravo’s sentencing:
“You took everything from Christian 
Aguilar,” Colaw said. “You took his past, who he had been. You took his future, 
what he would have been. You took it all from him when you took his life.”

If you’re wondering what the going rate for 
a man-sized chilli pepper is, Daniel Helfrich 
will tell you it costs four Powerade bottles and a smile. 
But his joy of owning such a massive fake 
fruit burned in the end because it took perpe-trators two days to steal his prized pepper. 
On July 16, Helfrich and his girlfriend, El-
len Toneff, were out for lunch at the Chili’s on Archer Road when they saw the plump pep-per perched on the parking lot. 
“Chili’s was doing some renovations and 
the giant chili was sitting outside,” Helfrich said, a 19-year-old UF classics junior. 
They joked about the idea of taking it home 
— but talking about it just wasn’t enough. 
The manager told them to speak with the 
renovation crew, so they started bartering. 
Helfrich offered some ice cream, but in-
stead, the parched workers wanted something to drink.  So Helfrich brought them two blue and two yellow bottles of Powerade. 
He then called his friend “Cool Kyle” to 
help hoist the 200-pound pepper into the back of his pickup truck. 
“We hauled it off in the rain,” Toneff said, a 
21-year-old UF biology senior. 
A chili of such size couldn’t possibly fit 
through the front door of his Pavilion on 62nd apartment, so Helfrich and his crew decided to hoist it to his balcony with ropes. 
Unable to get it to his balcony, Helfrich left 
the pepper on his neighbor’s first-floor balcony tied up to discourage anyone from taking it. 
That night, the culprits struck. The ropes holding it were cut, and the chili 
was gone before Helfrich even woke up. 
He went to work and never noticed that 
the chili was even missing. A friend told him later that the balcony where they placed it was empty. 
He filed a police report to find his priceless 
pepper on Tuesday. 
The apartment complex has a gated en-
trance where a guard takes information from new visitors.  
“Someone snuck it past the security guard,” 
Toneff said. She doesn’t know how a giant chili could slip by the guarded gate. Helfrich took to Facebook’s “UF Class of 
2016” thread to post that he was missing the chili and that a reward was in store for a suc-cessful return — fittingly with a Chili’s gift card valued at $20. 
“I had the chili for two days,” Helfrich said. 
“But that is the most likes on Facebook I’ve ever had.” 
Helfrich had big plans for the chili, like 
spicing it up with Christmas lights to have as decoration on his balcony. Helfrich and his friends usually “do it big” for the holidays, so having the pepper would have meant a lot to them.  MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Florida Prepaid tuition plan 
prices are expected to drop nearly 
$20,000 by next year, according to the Florida Prepaid College Board.
The lowered rate is mandated 
by House Bill 851, which Gov. Rick Scott signed into law last week and will go into effect July 1. It is the same bill that legalized in-state tu-ition for undocumented immigrants in Florida. 
The Stanley G. Tate Florida Pre-paid College Program payment plan allows parents or guardians to finance a child’s college tuition early 
by paying monthly installments as 
the child grows up. 
More than 11,600 UF students re-
ceived awards from the program in the 2012-2013 year, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes. 
Cindy Lorenzo, a 21-year-old UF 
biology senior, said she’s thankful her parents started investing early.
“I’ve been paying it for so long 
that the weight of college tuition isn’t so heavy on me,” she said. 
Students currently receiving aid 
will be reimbursed or credited the difference in aid, while future stu-dents enrolled in Florida Prepaid will simply pay a lower ticket price from the start. 
Lorenzo said if she receives the 
money in the form of a refund, she 
will still use it for its intended pur-
pose, but for graduate school in-stead.
The fee reductions are an attempt 
to combat the trend of tuition hikes that have been growing since 2008, when the state enacted a law allow-
ing universities to raise tuition up to 
15 percent above the state-mandated rate. 
“We are the largest and longest 
running prepaid program in the na-tion,” Florida Prepaid College Board executive director Kevin Thompson said in a press release. 
He said this will make sure the 
program continues to keep that title.Specifically, HB851 eliminates 
any increase in fees charged above the state-mandated rate for state 
universities excluding UF and Flor-
ida State University, whose fee in-creases are now limited to 6 percent above the state standard. 
According to the Florida Prepaid 
College Board, 4-Year Florida Uni-versity Plans and 2+2 Florida Plans 
purchased from the contract year 
2011 to 2014, as well as Tuition Dif-ferential Fee Plans purchased from the contract year 2008 to 2014, will now cost lower than they have in five years. 
Payments for new contracts are 
estimated at $250, down from $350. 
Those estimates will become con-
crete Oct. 15, when open enrollment officially begins. 
This is good news, said 22-year-
old UF advertising senior Maria 
Eisenhart. 
She said the decision of whether 
to sign up for Florida Prepaid has 
been hard for some of her friends. 
“My best friend got it for her 
niece,” she said.
But she said her friend has two 
nieces and had to choose between the two.  Now she will likely be able to afford to pay for both, she said.
Eisenhart said she plans to do the 
same for her future children. 
“You don’t know what situation 
you’ll be in financially as a parent, or what the child will be in.” With Pre-paid, she said, “at least they have, like, one step in the door.”

All eyes have been on Ferguson, Missouri, since 
earlier this month, when unarmed black teen-ager Michael Brown was shot dead by Darren 
Wilson, a white police officer. 
But even if everyone in the country is privy to this 
event and the continued police brutality directed toward 
American people of color, not everyone chooses to speak 
out against it. 
Many celebrities and public figures, specifically those 
who seem to most often dabble in hip-hop culture in an 
attempt to appeal to or appropriate from the black com-munity, have failed to use their status to speak up about 
the incident. In describing this phenomenon, Twitter 
user @locoernesto tweeted, “I have yet to hear anything about #Ferguson from Miley or Bieber. Katy? Iggy? Ev-eryone wants to be black until it’s time to be black.”
Ernesto’s tweet justifiably criticizes these celebrities 
for doing little to nothing in their power to fight against the systematic racism present in our society. The silence of these celebrities is particularly troubling because they love to implement the behaviors and mannerisms of black culture in order to sell their products.
Iggy adopts a “blaccent” when she raps, but black 
people who speak the same way in their everyday lives are perceived as uneducated. Katy Perry sports corn-rows and gelled-down baby hair in her “This Is How 
We Do” music video, but black and Latina women who 
style their hair the same way are often told their look is unprofessional in workplace settings. Justin wears his pants down below his waist, but this fashion may be 
one of the reasons why Darren Wilson decided Michael 
Brown was threatening enough to deserve an extrajudi-cial execution. 
When white celebrities engage in these behaviors, 
they’re seen as trendy. When black people engage in the 
same behaviors, they are almost always cast in a nega-
tive light.When the pot begins to boil, 
and the time is right for soci-ety to engage in a dialogue on 
matters of privilege, equality 
and social justice, some of the 
loudest voices choose to remain silent. They retreat into their whiteness and fail to engage with the monsters of 
racism and police brutality, monsters that are attacking 
our entire nation.
I imagine that these celebrities remain silent for 
many reasons. Perhaps they see profit in black people remaining targets while they imitate blacks in their acts 
and performances. They need black actions to continue 
to be seen as dangerous so when they do it, they can be perceived as edgy. 
Perhaps their intentions are nobler; maybe they 
don’t feel it’s their place to say anything in the matter, or they’re afraid their voices will drown out those of ac-tual black people. These are very real concerns for any prominent white supporter of equal rights for people of color.
But when social inequality is the issue at hand, tak-
ing a neutral stance is always the wrong decision.
Through their silence, these celebrities are maintain-
ing and strengthening the status quo — a status quo 
that allows the police forces across this country to ra-
cially profile and kill unarmed citizens.
Miley, Iggy and other stars who seem “to be black 
until it’s time to be black” need to know this: If you want to prove that the black community isn’t just a cash cow 
in your eyes, that you don’t twerk just because black 
people do it, but because you actually admire us and value our lives, then now is the time to end your silence and say something.

Fall semester is getting underway, and so is the Alligator’s 
search for new opinion columnists. The role of the colum-nist is one of the most important and rewarding positions 
that the Alligator has to offer.
You don’t have to be a journalism student to apply; we’re 
seeking a variety of perspectives and opinions that represent the many voices of the UF and Gainesville communities. As for column topics, anything goes: domestic politics, international affairs, the environment, pop culture, sex and relationships. Nothing is off-limits. 
No matter your areas of interest or expertise, strong writing 
skills, a passion for expressing opinions and an ability to meet deadlines are essential. Basic knowledge of AP Style is also pre-ferred but is not required.
Applications for columnist positions at the Alligator are due 
this Wednesday by 5 p.m.  and should be emailed to opinions@alligator.org. Your application should include a resume, a brief cover letter explaining your qualifications for the position and a short explanation of your political persuasion — liberal, conser-vative, libertarian, socialist, etc.
Our goal is to make the Opinions staff as diverse and as rep-
resentative of Gainesville’s student population as possible.
Applicants who have previously been published or who 
maintain a blog should submit two or three examples of your work. If you have not been published before, you can send in two 500- to 600-word writing samples demonstrating the work you would produce as a columnist for the Alligator. 
Columnist positions are unpaid and only open to UF and

Where Tent City once was now lie messily 
raked piles of debris. 
A worn path leads to the empty camping 
area, and bare patches of sand mark where 
many people called home.
July 8 was when bright orange “No Tres-
passing” signs took effect. July 8 was when people on the land were trespassing. 
However, most of the campers had already 
moved out of Tent City.
Gainesville Police visited Tent City, told 
campers of the eviction date and handed out fliers with information about relocation op-portunities, said GPD Lt. Brian Helmerson.
Some have relocated to other campsites, 
and some have moved to the woods around GRACE Marketplace, about 5 miles north.
To help with the move, the city approved 
2,000 one-year bus passes for the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hun-gry to give to those who need it. “Free bus passes have made it easier for 
people to get out to us,” she said. “And once they started moving out here, they found out that we are OK.”
Arupa Freeman, the founder of Homeless 
Outreach Mobile Effort (Home) Van, a service that brings necessities to the homeless, has focused her attention on fundraising for new 
tents to give to campers.
“Unless they are military-grade tents, tents 
aren’t meant to be full-time residences,” she 
said. “We are trying to get people a fresh start at their new locations.”
Tent City’s property owners allowed the 
campsite.
“We started off with one homeless man, 
Old Robert,” said Larry Calton, owner of part 
of the land and the Calton Dental Office near-
by. “Two or three years later, we had about 150 people living out there with no restroom facilities, all living on five acres of land.”
New residents kept moving in and calling 
Tent City home, including a large influx from the property where the new Regional Transit System facility is being built.
“In the group, there were quite a few nice 
people who were just down on their luck,” he said. However, other residents created an un-safe environment on the property, so they had to go. 
In the meantime, the homeless settle into 
their new camps. Trash is no longer scattered on the ground, but collected in big, black Hefty bags. Food roasts on open fires. People rebuild their homes.

A bad batch of Spice is believed 
to be the reason 28 people were hos-
pitalized for seizures at the end of May, leading to the raid of a local smoke shop and sending Gainesville 
residents reeling.
Spice is an illegal and highly 
toxic synthetic marijuana that can 
be bought at convenience stores and smoke shops. 
The rapidly accumulating num-
ber of seizure patients caused the Alachua County Health Depart-ment to post on Facebook on May 
30, warning of the toxic drug. Since then, the health department has be-
gun an investigation on the chemical components in the batch to see what might have caused the reaction.
“I don’t recall having this num-
ber of cases in such a short amount of time, and that is why the Alachua County Health Department is get-ting involved,” said Paul Myers, Alachua County Health Department director.
Patients admitted to local hospi-
tals had experienced seizures and 
were in altered mental states. But 
not all patients seized. One case that didn’t result in hospitalization in-volved vomiting and diarrhea.
Between May 30 and May 31, the 
number of cases had jumped from 11 to more than two dozen, and by June 2, the number reached 28.
Gainesville-Alachua County 
Drug Task Force raided Land B4 Time, 604 N. Main Street, on May 31, in conjunction with the seizures. As of press time, the store has remained closed, and the phone number for the store is disconnected.
The drug task force seized sev-
eral pounds of Spice, $2,000 in cash, pipes and a shotgun during the raid, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
Spice has been illegal in Florida 
since March 2012, but distributors skirt the legal issue by changing the chemical composition of the drug and marking it “not for consump-
tion.”
“To the outsider, we should just 
be able to look on the package and 
see that it’s “Spice,” but it unfortu-nately is not that easy,” Tobias said.
While the active ingredient in 
weed, Tetrahydrocannabinol, oc-curs naturally, Spice is typically a collection of herbs sprayed with lab-
created cannabinoids.  
“The seizure is more likely caused by synthetic cannabinoid, which is 
not like THC, which is what you get from the cannabis plant,” said Jamie Solen, associate professor in the de-
partment of psychiatry. 
“The THC you smoke and in-
hale has its own ability to prevent 
seizures and its own innate ability to prevent the psychosis and delu-sional state” that has been seen in the Spice patients, he said. 
The synthetic cannabinoid has a 
stronger effect than THC.
Two cannabinoid receptors in 
the brain absorb the active ingredi-ent in marijuana or Spice. THC only partially stimulates the brain once absorbed, but the synthetic cannabi-noids found in Spice turn the recep-tor on full blast, Solen said.
This causes the neurons to over-
charge with electricity, and the elec-
trical explosion in the brain causes 
muscles to seize up, Solen said.The synthetic cannabinoid can 
also cause an increase in blood pres-sure to a hypertensive rate, rapid heart beat almost to the state of a 
heart attack, hallucinations and 
vomiting. 
“It really impairs you if you 
smoke too much,” said a UF sopho-more who asked not be named. “Per-sonally, it got me really head high to the point where if I tried to move, at times I would get a migraine.”
Users are drawn to the synthetic 
drug by low prices and the promise of a better high, he said. 
“I heard that it got you ‘higher’ 
than regular weed, and it ended up being much cheaper too, so I figured I’d try it. I only stopped after one of my friends had a terrible trip, and I saw what it could do to him,” the 19 year old said. “I haven’t smoked it 
since. I don’t ever plan on smoking 
it again.”

Keith Stegath is fed up with poli-
ticians and lawyers making deci-
sions they are not qualiﬁ  ed for.
That’s why the 57-year-old UF 
alumnus decided he isn’t going to sit around any longer. He’s now tak-ing action by running in the Florida 2014 gubernatorial elections in No-vember as a write-in candidate.
Stegath, who has a bachelor’s 
degree in electrical engineering and a master’s in mechanical engineer-
ing, said one of his biggest issues is 
that the state — and nation — needs more engineers in public ofﬁ  ce.
“We’re in the 21st century, but 
the country is in the 20th century be-cause of politicians today,” Stegath said. “The people we’re electing do not understand the decisions they have to make on the technologies 
they don’t understand.”
Stegath, running as an indepen-dent, said another thing he would 
like to accomplish as governor is to decriminalize marijuana in the state. He’s opposed to fully legaliz-
ing it and insists a ﬁ  ne for public use 
would beneﬁ  t everyone.
Because Stegath is running as a 
write-in candidate, voters are going to have to do exactly that: write a name on their ballot, wrote UF pro-fessor Stephen Craig in an email.
“Basically, write-in candidates 
are protest (or vanity) candidates,” 
Craig said. “They almost never have 
much money, voters don’t know who they are, and their prospects of winning are negligible.”
But that isn’t stopping Stegath, 
who is self-ﬁ  nancing and solely run-
ning his campaign. 
He’s going to spend the next few 
months campaigning while running 
his Gainesville-based business, Ad-vanced Electric Vehicles, that builds zero-emission automobiles.
Stegath said one of his biggest 
concerns with Gov. Rick Scott and other politicians is that they support 
the money that got them elected.
“Scott is shortsighted and doesn’t really have any technical knowl-
edge.” Stegath said. “(Politicians) have their supporters who say ‘This is a good idea,’ and they don’t have 
the knowledge to say ‘Hey, that’s 
not a good idea.’”
Stegath also seeks to address 
power plant inefﬁ  ciency, make home construction more efﬁ  cient with zero-impact technologies and form a policy to help college students pay off their debt. For more information about his platforms or how to vote 
for a Stegath as a write-in candidate,

UF’s next president could 
make more than $1 million a 
year.
On July 8, the university’s 
Board of Trustees unanimously 
approved the salary recom-
mendations made by Mercer, a consulting firm: a range from about $900,000 to $1.25 million.
Steven Scott, chair of the 
presidential search committee, was authorized to negotiate salary for the new president within that range. The final 
number will be based on the 
qualifications and experience of the future president. 
“We just need to have this 
range carved out,” Scott said.
Mercer surveyed 12 peer 
institutions in the 62-member American Association of Uni-versities, of which UF is the only Florida school, to determine an appropriate salary for UF’s next president, said Stephen Pollack, one of the Mercer consultants.
The seven peer public uni-
versities and five private uni-versities, including academic stars like Penn State, Ohio State and Harvard, are in the 75th percentile of salaries paid to their presidents, said Pollack.
“That’s in order to attract 
the caliber of the person you 
want,” Pollack said.
Florida tax dollars make 
up a maximum of $200,000 of 
a president’s salary. The rest comes from private donations, according to Alligator archives.      
Current UF President Bernie 
Machen makes $525,166 a year 
in base pay, with his total salary 
reaching $720,594, according to the Chronicle of Higher Educa-tion. Before agreeing to stay an 
extra year, his total compensa-
tion was $565,492, according to Alligator archives.Board of Trustees

Local police identified a UF stu-
dent after back-to-back public mas-
turbation incidents in June.
Gainesville Police filed a sworn 
complaint for lewd acts against 18-
year-old UF student Eric Cody Mox-am after a joint investigation with 
University Police, according to a UF 
emergency notification.  
A female student called UPD on 
June 11 after she witnessed Moxam masturbating while sitting on a bench near Little Hall on Tuesday around 11:30 a.m., according to the notification. 
Gainesville Police also respond-
ed on June 9 to reports of Moxam al-legedly masturbating near Sorority Row, according to the notification.
Moxam has not responded to 
multiple requests to comment. The woman who reported the in-
cident to UPD said Moxam sat next to her on the bench for about 10 min-utes before she noticed him mastur-bating. She then left the area.
“He’s trespassed from campus,” 
said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes, meaning Moxam cannot attend class or set foot on campus for an unde-termined amount of time.
A week later, Moxam was ar-
rested on simple battery charges following an argument with his ex-girlfriend at his apartment. He was adamant he did not hurt her.

The Stephen C. O’Connell Center will get a $45 mil-
lion face-lift next year, UF and the University Athletic 
Association announced Tuesday.
The UAA will contribute $35 million and UF will fi-
nance the rest of the renovation, which is set to begin 
in March and end in December of 2015, said O’Connell 
Center Director Lynda Reinhart.
“The scope of the project is going to be gutting the 
whole building, renovating it with new seats, new club seating and a club lounge,” said Bahar Armaghani, as-sistant director and project manager for UF’s Office of Planning, Design and Construction.
Armaghani said the main renovation will be a promi-
nent entryway facing east toward the James W. “Bill” Heavener Football Complex.
Reinhart said there are currently four entry points 
but none of them are distinct. She said the funding will give the center a more modernized look.
But not all changes are cosmetic.Internal improvements like plumbing renovations 
and electrical rewiring will improve comfort and reduce 
energy consumption, Reinhart said.
Two-time All-American swimmer Lindsey McKnight 
said she’s looking forward to the new chairs.
“I’ve known people to even bring seat cushions 
‘cause they’re sitting there for so long,” she said.
Reinhart said UF is planning to relocate practices and 
concerts during that time but has yet to secure a space.
In order to be completed by the December 2015 dead-
line, the project is slated to begin in March.
“We’re looking at every opportunity that we have to 
make it as efficient as we can,” she said. “It’s gonna be 
a great project, and we’re going to have a great product when it’s finished.”Student caught mastubating in public

Florida’s ban on same-sex 
marriage was declared unconsti-
tutional in July.
And since then, there have 
been three more court decisions.
The July 25 ruling by Miami-
Dade County Circuit Judge Sar-ah Zabel mirrored the decision made earlier by Monroe County Circuit Judge Luis Garcia.
“Preventing couples from 
marrying solely on the basis of their sexual orientation serves no governmental interest,” Judge 
Zabel wrote in her opinion.
Shortly after, Attorney Gen-
eral Pam Bondi ﬁ  led an appeal.
Darren Hutchinson, a UF law 
professor, said most judges who 
have ruled in favor of same-sex couples have stayed their ruling in anticipation of appeals by state defendants, as Bondi has done in both Florida cases thus far.
This put the ruling on hold 
until a clean decision is made.
“They’re just trying to avoid 
the chaos that could result if cou-ples started getting married and an appeals court later reversed the ruling favoring same-sex marriage,” Hutchinson said.
Mallory Garner-Wells, a 
public policy director of Equal-ity Florida, the organization that ﬁ  led the lawsuit along with six same-sex couples, said that it is likely that the Miami and Key West lawsuit will be combined into one case.
“They ask the same funda-
mental question: Should Florida 
recognize same-sex marriages?” 
she said.
The Miami-Dade ruling is one 
of several court decisions striking down same-sex marriage bans in the U.S., most recently in Colo-rado and Virginia.“I think they’re moving past 
questions about morality to ques-tions about equal protection un-der the 14th Amendment,” Ste-
ven Noll, a UF history professor 
said. “Even conservative judges that may feel homosexuality is not acceptable ﬁ  nd that there is no legal justiﬁ  cation that same-sex marriage is illegal.”
Both Garcia and Zabel were 
appointed by former Gov. Jeb Bush and re-elected.
“These are not liberal judges 
castigated by the right as mak-ers of new law. It’s not a liberal fringe that’s moving the country this way,” Noll said. “It’s people who follow the law.”
Hutchinson believes that both 
judges felt comfortable with the ruling because they know public 
opinion on the issue is shifting.
“When judges make decisions 
in controversial cases, they try to 
be aware of how the decision will be received,” Hutchinson said. “The judges in Florida know the tide is turning.”Judge OKs FL same-sex marriage

When Stephanie Cruz heard the 
2014 lineup for Gator Growl, she 
screamed.
“It kind of brings me back to 
the music we listened to in middle 
school,” said Cruz, a 20-year-old UF 
computer science junior.
Gator Growl’s lineup of Foster 
the People, Ludacris and emcee Brooks Wheelan of Saturday Night 
Live has UF students and Gator fans 
alike excited.
The pep rally will be held Oct. 17 
at 6 p.m. on Flavet Field, a new ven-
ue for the event that has taken place 
in the Swamp for the last 82 years.
The event will include local food 
trucks, the traditional ﬁ  reworks display and a 6-foot wind screen around Flavet Field, said Devin Mc-Daniel, executive producer of Gator Growl.
Tickets are available on the Gator 
Growl website and run $15 for stu-dents, $25 for nonstudent general 
admission and $40 for bleacher seat-
ing.
Cruz has not been to any of the 
other Gator Growls during her time at UF, but said the new lineup deﬁ  -nitely motivates her. She’s excited abou the chance to meet the per-formers. 
The move to Flavet Field is meant 
to create a more intimate environ-ment, but it also reﬂ  ects a decline in ticket sales and is a cheaper venue for Gator Growl organizers.
In order to drive those numbers 
back up, McDaniel said her group wants to “reinvent the wheel” in terms of Gator Growl as an event.

By 2015, all UF residence 
halls will have central air 
conditioning. 
Next summer, central air 
conditioning units will be 
installed in Thomas Hall for 
$1.7 million. Residence halls that previously didn’t have A/C only had wall units.  
Sharon Blansett, assistant 
to the associate vice presi-dent for Student Affairs, wrote that $4 million to $6 million is set aside each year from rent profits for resi-
dence hall renovations.
For Sara Wedemeyer, 
a 19-year-old UF geology 
sophomore, air conditioning is a welcome addition.
“Things change, and time 
changes,” she said. “So if these dorms change, their popularity would change 
because they wouldn’t cater 
to today’s living.” 
Jackie Ramos, a 20-year-
old UF nutritional science senior, said although it’s nice to have air condition-ing, the buildings, some of the first residence halls at UF, are losing history.
“There isn’t going to be 
anything left from the past,” she said. “They’ll be just like any other building at UF.”All residence halls to

UF has hired 37 professors who 
may begin as soon as this Fall, as 
part of the university’s preeminence drive.
Last year, the Florida Legislature 
allocated UF $15 million annually for ﬁ  ve years to help the university become a top 10 public university, an amount President Bernie Machen pledged to match with private do-nations.
“We felt we couldn’t use it on 
facilities,” Machen said during a Board of Trustees meeting on June 6. 
“From the very beginning, this has 
been a faculty-driven process.”
During Summer 2013, the univer-
sity sought out proposals for areas of preeminence study from deans and institute directors. 
They received 52 “well-thought-
out” proposals and narrowed it to 26 initiatives that would build on 
UF’s current research, as well as 
“new trends on the horizon we can’t afford to overlook.”
UF committed more than $18 
million to the 26 initiatives, dwarf-ing its, at the time, $15 million in preeminence funding. 
“We assumed, kind of like air-
line scheduling, that we would 
overbook,” Machen said. “We were 
encouraged by the quality of the proposals and the breadth of the proposals.”
Luckily for UF, Florida’s 2014 
budget included an extra $5 million for UF’s preeminence campaign. 
The initiatives include topics like 
big data, cyber security, renewable 
energy and storage, social network 
analysis and online learning. UF has hired professors in 15 of the 26 initia-tives.
Machen said UF expected 50 to 
60 more hires in the next ﬁ  scal year.
“The idea was to hire midcareer 
and distinguished professors that could immediately contribute to 
their ﬁ  eld of research,” he said.Machen said his team decided 
against hiring junior faculty, citing 
the time it would take for less-expe-rienced faculty’s research to mature. 
Meanwhile, UF’s $800 million 
preeminence plan, of which $285 million has been raised this year, has been divvied up as well. 
The plan allocated $8 million go-
ing to undergraduate support, $21 
million to research, $140 million to 
program support, $85 million to fac-ulty support, $17 million to graduate support and $15 million to campus enhancement.
Provost Joe Glover called this an 
exciting and chaotic period for UF.
“We moved from a period of 
recession where the university did 
almost no hiring at all to a period 
where suddenly, the deans found that they were having to interview one or two people every day,” he said.
This has led to some faculty 
grumbling, but Machen doesn’t seem concerned.
“That’s the kind of complaint I 
like to hear,” Machen said.UF hires 37 professors to start in Fall

Stumbling the streets for Gator 
Stompin’ pub crawl has been a 
Gainesville tradition for 32 years.
But overspending on this year’s 
Gator Stompin’ may have cost the event its 33rd year — unless Jason Bowman can come up with a solu-tion, and fast.
“The debt is mine and Pledge 5’s. 
We’re working to eliminate that,” said Bowman, director of Pledge 5 Foundation, the volunteer service organization that has hosted Gator Stompin’ for the past nine years.
Due to an unforeseen drop in 
thrift store sales and an overpriced concert, Pledge 5 owes multiple 
employees and nearly 80 bars and 
restaurants various amounts — any-where from $100 to $10,000 — for their participation in Gator Stompin’ in May.
Frustrated and without pay, 
some disgruntled employees have quit. Pledge 5 is currently facing two lawsuits in small claims court.
Former thrift store manager Em-
ily Sacco, who filed one of the law-suits on July 28, said Bowman owes her four months of pay.
“I didn’t make a dime,” she said.This is the first year Pledge 5 has funded Gator Stompin’ with thrift shop funds, Bowman said.
“We were in the process of open-
ing the third store while putting on Pledge 5’s largest fundraiser,” Sacco said.
The initial stores were profit-
able during Fall and prompted the foundation to open more. The Gator Stompin’ concert was a success last year, so this year, Bowman shot 
higher — Waka Flocka Flame and 
Grammy-nominated DJ Wolfgang Gartner would surely increase ticket sales, he thought.
Taking in to account artist com-
pensation, venue fees and other concert costs, Pledge 5 paid close to $90,000 to bring the duo downtown.
Then spring came, and sales 
dropped. Average daily revenue stooped to a quarter of what it had been in the fall. 
“We would have been OK if our 
thrift shop revenue remained steady through the spring,” Bowman said. “To say it plummeted would be an understatement.”
The concert was paid for, but 
Pledge 5 had yet to compensate its employees and had no funds avail-able to reimburse the bars and res-taurants.
Frustrated and unemployed, 
Sacco spoke to the U.S. Department of Labor in Jacksonville and filed the lawsuit, but she said she doesn’t expect to get back the money she’s 
owed.
“I know I will not get that,” she said. “He simply does not have it.”
“In the future, we’re going to sep-
arate Gator Stompin’ from Pledge 
5,” Bowman said. He plans to gain capital for Gator Stompin’ through an equity crowdfunding website called SeedInvest, which began after the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act deregulated certain online busi-ness ventures in 2012.
Like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, 
SeedInvest crowdfunds to start-up businesses. But rather than taking donations, SeedInvest sells shares.
He said he believes the crowd-
funding plan is viable because Gainesville residents love Gator Stompin’ and want it to continue.
Pledge 5 has been trying to re-
gain that trust by issuing businesses 
small checks as thrift store profits 
begin to increase again. He has a few employees working in the thrift shops and three on staff at the office, and he said he canceled the larger of the upcoming Pledge 5 commu-nity events, with most of the charity drives and volunteer service events still operational.
“I won’t feel comfortable until 
everything is right,” he said.
Even if the crowdfunding plan 
falls through, Bowman said he’s con-fident thrift store sales will produce enough to pay everyone back by the end of 2014, and said Gainesville shouldn’t have doubts about Gator Stompin’ 2015.
“I really think that we’re going to 
get through it,” Bowman said.

The College of Fine Arts is 
now the College of the Arts, but 
students wonder if the degree will be just as fine.
The change is designed to 
reflect a more encompassing name for all of the programs under the college, said Leah Craig, the public relations and marketing manager for the Col-lege of the Arts.
“‘Fine’ no longer represents 
the college as it used to,” she said.  
“It’s not just visual arts,” 
Craig said. “Now we have mu-sic, dance, theater and digital arts programs.”
Adreenah Wynn, a 20-year-
old UF art and technology ju-nior, said she prefers “College of Fine Arts” over the new title. 
“My friends and I wish we 
could have found out about it through email or a newsletter. I only found out through Face-book,” Wynn said. “I wish we had more input.”
She is also concerned about 
how the name change will af-
fect her degree. 
“The ‘fine’ in fine arts is very 
prestigious,” Wynn said. She said she thinks that “fine arts” 
caters to a specific type of disci-pline and sees “the arts” as too general.
Ivette De Santiago, a 20-year-
old UF art and technology ju-nior, is also concerned about how the change will be reflect-ed on her diploma. She doesn’t 
see the name change having a 
direct effect on students.
“As long as it doesn’t affect 
the curriculum, I don’t think it 
will change what will happen 
in the classroom,” she said.
 Craig said the name change 
will come slowly, with changes in building names, websites, brochures and other literature.
Students like Wynn don’t 
see immediate change coming either. She said she thinks that it will probably take at least a year for her and her peers to 
even start saying College of the 
Arts.College of Arts drops

Courtney McEwen spent her summer sav-
ing up for a new bike.
The 19-year-old UF nutritional sciences 
sophomore said she loves her new set of wheels.
She likes to ride it to the grocery store, to 
the gym, where she works. She can’t wait to 
ride her bike more in the future.
But starting in the Fall, the one place she 
can’t ride her bike is through the Norman 
Tunnel.
Due to several complaints from UF faculty 
and other members of the UF community, a construction team will renovate the tunnel to make it safer for pedestrians.
The team will install a series of posts and 
railings to separate the trafﬁ  c and slow down 
the bicycles.
“The mix of biker and pedestrian trafﬁ  c in the tunnel really isn’t as safe as we’d like it to 
be,” said Scott Fox, director of Transportation and Parking Services at UF.
When bicyclists enter the tunnel, many of 
them struggle to build up enough momen-tum to pull their weight up the steep incline at the other end, Fox said.
In the past, they tried to create separate 
lanes for bikers and pedestrians, he said, but they had limited success because people re-ally don’t stay in their lanes.
Because of the grafﬁ  ti in the tunnel, any 
lines and signs placed in the tunnel were in-effective because they ended up getting cov-ered up.
“Our goal is to create a safer tunnel expe-
rience for everybody,” Fox said.
When McEwen rides over to Norman, she 
said she won’t mind hopping off her bike.
She said she understands that some might 
be annoyed by the changes. 
But if the renovations mean that people 
will be safer when using the tunnel, it’s a good trade-off.
“At the worst, it will add 30 seconds to 
your travel time if you are a biker,” she said.18, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014
Tunnel addition improves safety

Pedestrians will have to weave through the posts, and bicyclists will have to slow

Illegally parking at a friend’s apartment 
complex “just for a minute” now has an even 
more expensive consequence.The Gainesville City Commission voted 
5-2 to raise the rates of roam towing during a meeting on June 19, which raised the rate from $76 to $100 for light-duty vehicles.
Mayor Ed Braddy and Commissioner Ran-
dy Wells voted against the measure.
This is the ﬁ  rst signiﬁ  cant rate hike since 
1994, when the roam towing rate was $70, Commissioner Todd Chase said.
Since then, towing companies argued, and 
expenses have gone up.At the meeting, UF Student Body President 
Cory Yeffet spoke against the decision, which was made in the last ﬁ  ve minutes of the com-mission meeting.
Yeffet said he would support raising tow-
ing fees if it were backed up with ﬁ  nancial data, but he called this jump “unsubstantiated and arbitrary.”
He voiced concern that rising fees would 
“increase predatory practices” of local roam towing companies.“The students deﬁ  nitely feel that $76 is 
pretty high as is,” he said. “Especially com-pared to the cost of getting your car towed regularly if it breaks down.”
UF’s Student Senate has been vocal against 
towing fee raises in the past. They passed a resolution against rising fees in 2012, when the tow rate hike was last discussed, according to Alligator archives.Gainesville roam towing fee to rise after City Commission vote

The Longest Handy Ever didn’t last very 
long.
On July 19, five contestants gathered 
around a 5-and-a-half foot long inflatable 
penis — adorned with a Sharpie smiley face 
— to compete in the “Longest Handy Ever 
Contest,” sponsored by X-Mart at 3510 SW 13th St.The last contestant with his or her hand 
firmly affixed to the air-filled phallus won a goody bag of more than $250 worth of sex toys, lingerie and sexual supplements.
At about 1:10 p.m., five contestants circled 
the penis, set up on a white display shelf fes-tooned with red ribbons and blue-and-white streamers. Contest organizer and store man-ager Sam Collins, 33, warns contestants that they may not leave for any reason, and the 
last hand on the penis wins the prize.
The contest begins.
Eight minutes later, the first contestant 
leaves to walk her dog.
As the contestants chat and lean on the 
slowly deflating shaft, Collins helps cus-tomers — mostly couples — who wander 
through the store. He calls himself a relation-
ship rehabilitation specialist.
“I help people,” he says. “We change the 
world, one orgasm at a time.”
Two contestants, Kyle Savery, 19, and Pe-
dro Gonzales, 19, drove from Jacksonville for this competition. 
Savery, who studies education at Florida 
State College at Jacksonville smokes, but he 
assures the small crowd that he “isn’t a chain 
smoker,” so he won’t be distracted. 
Katrina “Kat” Gottschalch, 25, lets her 
competitors know she’s here for the long run. 
“I have nothing better to do today,” she 
says. “I’ll sit here until 8. I don’t care.”
Her roommate, Holden Howard, 23, also 
has his hand on the now considerably limp 
penis. He, like all the others, heard about this 
competition from an employee and not the Facebook event to which 30 people RSVP’d. He works retail and moonlights as a DJ two nights a week.
At 2 p.m., Howard lets go and wanders 
away.
Gonzales and Savery realize they have 
not eaten all day and begin planning a trip to 
Satchel’s Pizza.
Gottschalch seizes the opportunity and 
proposes a solution: She wins the competi-
tion and shares the goodies.
With visions of pepperoni and cheese in 
their heads, the remaining competitors agree and drop out —  a mere hour after the com-petition began.
She unzips a large black duffel bag to 
reveal pornography, nipple clamps and a vibrating dildo mounted on a black bouncy ball. She pulls each item out and squeals with excitement.
“I feel like Santa with a sack full of pres-
ents,” she laughs. 20, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014

UF is reaping the benefits of Florida’s 
largest budget in history, with added 
funding for new study spaces, renova-tions and the preeminence campaign.
Gov. Rick Scott signed Florida’s 2014-
2015 budget on June 2, allocating almost $100 million to UF. This includes $10 mil-lion to renovate Newell Hall into a study space for students, a longtime project for UF Student Government.
“After a long haul of advocating for 
funding for direly needed study space on campus,  Scott and the Florida Leg-islature have finally signed off on this 
project,” said Student Body President 
Cory Yeffet during a Senate meeting on June 3.    
The project, which would turn New-
ell Hall into a bookless, 24/7 study hall, would cost about $13 million, according to Alligator archives.
Another key project is the renovation 
of the chemistry building. This year, $20 
million was allocated to the project, on 
top of the $22 million the Legislation has approved in the past. 
“We are pleased that this budget 
gives us the resources to do more for our students and the state of Florida,” UF President Bernie Machen said.Newell to be

Alan Shapiro began his horti-
cultural career cutting grass, and 
soon, he may be growing it.
Located down a bumpy, na-
tive plant-lined dirt road is Gran-diﬂ  ora, a 106-acre wholesale re-gional plant nursery with clients 
including Disney, UF and Busch 
Gardens.
Shapiro, the 63-year-old presi-
dent of Grandiﬂ  ora, gestures at the rows of the nearly 2,000 types 
of neatly potted succulents, ﬂ  ow-
ers and herbs in his greenhouses.
“Look, we do medicinal plants 
already,” he said, pointing at a 
patch of aloe, a plant used to treat 
sunburns.
Each of the ﬂ  owering plants 
bears the phrase “Grandiﬂ  ora Grown...long-lasting, southern 
blooms.”
But someday soon, that label 
may ﬁ  nd its way onto an entire-
ly different product — medical 
marijuana.
Grandiﬂ  ora, also known as 
San Felasco Nurseries, is one of 
39 nurseries that meet the speciﬁ  -cations of Florida’s latest medical 
marijuana legislation.
Senate Bill 1030, also known 
as the “Compassionate Medical 
Cannabis Act of 2014,” legalized 
noneuphoric medical marijuana 
for speciﬁ  ed patients with debili-tating or terminal diseases. Gov. Rick Scott signed the bill on June 16.
According to the bill, nurser-
ies seeking a license must meet 
speciﬁ  c qualiﬁ  cations. They must 
have been in business for at least 30 years, have the capacity to grow more than 400,000 plants and afford a $5 million bond.
But only ﬁ  ve nurseries in Flor-
ida will be licensed to grow the crop — one for each corner of the state, plus central Florida.
The rest of the details — on 
growing, dispensing and selling the product — are pretty much up in the air, said Aaron Keller, spokesman for the Florida De-
partment of Agriculture.
“The Florida Department of 
Health will be doing rulemaking, 
and they will really be the point 
agency involved in creating that 
system of regulation and enforce-ment,” he said. “Our role as the Department of Agriculture is re-ally just to identify the growers 
who would be allowed to based 
on the Legislature’s actions.”
The northeast section of the 
state, where Gainesville falls, has 
two potential candidates: Grandi-
ﬂ  ora, in Gainesville, and Loop’s Nursery, in Jacksonville.
When the original list of po-
tential growers came out, Shapiro 
said he was surprised to see his 
nursery named but even more so at the ﬂ  ood of phone calls that followed.
“People are calling me from 
other states where it’s already been legalized for medical mari-juana, and they would like to partner, or they would like to support growers, they would like to help set up our operation,” he said. 
But before he can  begin to con-
sider taking on partners, Shapiro said he’s going to ﬁ  nd a lawyer to help him with the process.
He doesn’t know what kind of 
changes he’d have to make to be able to grow the herb, as the state has yet to release details, but he’d be willing to retroﬁ  t empty or un-
used parts of the nursery to meet requirements.
“I’m not counting my chickens 
before they hatch,” he said. “Be-
cause I don’t want to put tons of research in and then fail. I want to do just enough to do the pro-
posal for the state and explain to 
them why we’d be a good opera-tion for them to use.”
Shapiro has been involved 
with horticulture since he mowed lawns during his summers at UF, where he graduated in 1972 with an English degree.
Now, more than 40 years later, 
he still loves plants and their ben-eﬁ  ts to humanity. Although his motivations are monetary, Sha-
piro said he still worries about 
the effects of legalized marijuana on society, especially its exposure to children.
“Even if you have stores that 
check your ID, you can always convince an older friend to get it for you or raid your mom’s li-quor cabinet,” he said. “What’s to 
say the same thing won’t happen 
with marijuana?”
Broader use of medical mari-
juana will come to a vote in No-vember with Amendment 2 is on 
the ballot. The initiative needs 60 
percent of the vote to pass.

In two years, Depot Avenue 
will have roundabouts, landscap-
ing and decorative lighting. But 
for now, it’s closed to trafﬁ  c for construction. 
Work began May 19 on the 
section between South Main and Southwest 11th Street, near Soror-
ity Row and Royal Village apart-
ments.
As of Friday, the roundabout 
on Southwest 11th Street near PK Younge Elementary School was open, said Philip Mann, assistant 
public works director for the City of Gainesville. But the rest of the 
depot is still closed between South-
west Sixth Street and Main Street.
Drivers can detour through 
Southwest Fourth, Southwest Fifth 
or Southwest 16th avenues to get to 
Southwest Sixth Street, said project 
manager John Veilleux. Trafﬁ  c on Main Street will be unaffected.
The reconstruction is projected 
to be ﬁ  nished by summer 2016, Veilleux said.
“We think two years is a good 
duration to make it so the contrac-tor will be busy,” he said. “We’ve 
got enough time in there to ac-
count for delays.”
The $6.5-million project is fund-
ed mostly through a county incen-tive grant, but also with money from Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties for the utility and wastewater work, Veilleux said. The rest is 
from local funds, which are bonds owned by the city.
The largest part of the project 
will be the three roundabouts lo-cated at Southwest 11th Street, 
Southwest Sixth Street and South 
Main Street, which were chosen to better match the ﬂ  ow of trafﬁ  c. said 
project manager John Veilleux
But the roundabouts aren’t a 
positive addition for everyone.
Avid biker Nathaly Ruiz, a 21-
year-old UF English senior, said 
bikers ﬁ  nd roundabouts confusing 
and scary.
“It’s more dangerous because 
you just have to go when you think its safe. There are no lights or sig-
nals,” she said. “It kind of seems like at any point, something could 
come around and hit you.”MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 23

UF began the gradual process of switch-
ing from Sakai to the new course manage-
ment system Canvas this summer.  
UF Information Technology announced in May that the transition is scheduled to be 
complete by Summer 2016. 
However, UF may be sacriﬁ  cing a few 
things in the switch, said Douglas Johnson, 
the assistant director for learning services at UFIT.   
Students who were annoyed with the 
Sakai’s two separate grading tabs can breathe easy, Canvas will only have one. But because Sakai is open-source software 
and Canvas is not entirely open-source, UF will have to go through the course manage-
ment company to ﬁ  x any bugs. The compa-ny can choose to make these changes based on its business needs.     
“This is a huge experiment to see what Canvas brings out,” Johnson said, “but 
many people are convinced the beneﬁ  ts 
of Canvas will outweigh the beneﬁ  ts of Sakai.”
Bahar Pourshariati, a 21-year-old recent 
UF psychology alumna, said that it’s tough 
to know if Canvas will be better than Sakai.    
“They are constantly trying to improve 
their technology and stay on top of the

always better.”UF Information Technology makes moves to replace SakaiSW 4th Ave

UF does not plan to expand 
health care coverage for graduate 
assistants, UF administrators told 
graduate assistants on June 5.
Administrators refused Gradu-
ate Assistants United’s proposal that asked for vision and dental coverage for the teaching assistants, citing a 
deﬁ  cit in GatorCare. 
“Compared to other programs both in and out of Florida, you have a very robust plan,” UF Board of 
Trustees head of bargaining Bill Connellan told the 15 union mem-bers during the meeting. 
The union contended the pro-
posed UF raised premium rates for graduate assistants as well, which includes a $409 increase per em-ployee for the 2014-2015 school year, 
according to GAU records.
Administrators said GatorGrad-
Care speciﬁ  cally is estimated to be 
more than $1 million in deﬁ  cit, forc-ing UF to raise the premiums. 
Graduate students said they 
were upset they were not consulted before the change in price. “It’s like, rip out the IV ﬁ  rst, ask 
questions later,” said 29-year-old GAU chief negotiator and co-presi-dent Emily McCann. 
Administrators consulted an out-
side accounting ﬁ  rm but said they had no data to show for it.
“I think it was just number 
crunching,” Connellan said.
The union also raised issues with 
UF’s handling of disciplinary proce-dures in which graduate assistants have been tried by both the Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce and Employee Rela-tions for the same issue.
“I should not be tried twice on 
campus,” said 29-year-old sociol-ogy Ph.D. candidate Luis Caraballo-Burgos, who took over for McCann 
as chief negotiator for GAU after the 
meeting. “It takes up a lot of time, and it costs us a lot of money.”
McCann said graduate assistants 
straddle the line between student and employee.
“We need to have those differ-
ent parallel processes very clearly spelled out,” she said.
Former graduate assistant Paul 
Ortiz spoke up for the graduate stu-dents on behalf of the United Fac-ulty of Florida.
“We completely support GAU’s 
bargaining position,” he said. 
He said UFF would like to see the 
end of all graduate fees. “We depend on graduate assis-
tants as fellow intellectuals. Paying for the right to work takes away from that,” he said. 
In the face of preeminence, the 
university’s goal of becoming a top 10 public research university, UF ad-ministrators should work to end the fees, Ortiz said. 
The union and administrators 
will meet again to continue bargain-ing over the health care premiums.
Both the union and UF adminis-
trators said they’re working to reach a conclusion that will satisfy both parties.
“I believe we’ve made some good 
progress,” said Connellan.

After closing its doors due to infrastruc-
tural problems, The Jones management and 
staff are looking to make its remaining loca-tion stronger than ever. 
They are looking at the bright side of the 
situation, despite closures to the  Eastside loca-tion in July.  
Audrey Dingeman, general manager of 
The Jones, said it was a positive business move. The business is now entirely run out of 
The Jones B-side location downtown. 
“We’d really like to focus on putting all our 
love we’ve put into the community and our 
clientele and put it in one location,” she said. 
The 38-seat restaurant served breakfast and 
lunch at the 401 NE 23rd Ave. location since August 2005.  Dingeman said The Jones East-side was in an old building and needed work, which was beyond the management’s control, prompting the restaurant’s closure. 
Gladys Alvear, front-of-house manager of 
The Jones, said she will miss the Eastside. 
“We had a solid crowd of people that 
would come over just because they were do-ing laundry,” she said. 
Alvear said she’s excited about bringing 
the Eastside’s menu to The Jones B-side. 
“I think it’s going to add to the atmosphere 
here,” Alvear said. 
Its popular breakfast items are now served 
at The Jones B-Side, which is taking over the breakfast menu and other menu items from the Eastside location. 
“A lot of these items were high in demand,” 
she said. 
Jones regular Christopher Garland, a 32-
year-old UF English Ph.D. candidate, said he thinks bringing breakfast to the B-side will at-tract more customers to the restaurant. 
She said she hopes nostalgic Eastside regu-
lars will come enjoy its breakfast menu at the B side.
“We want them to know we’re mourning 
the loss as well,” Dingeman said, “and we’d like to mourn together.”Jones Eastside closes, breakfast moves to B-side location

Antonio Morrison is ready to 
move past the 2013 season.
It started with two summer ar-
rests within a five-week span — the 
first for punching a bouncer on June 16, 2013 and the second for barking at a police dog on July 20, 2013 — that 
resulted in the middle linebacker be-
ing suspended for the season opener against Toledo.
It ended with the then-sophomore 
being sidelined after tearing the me-
niscus in his right knee in Florida’s 34-17 loss to Vanderbilt on Nov. 9, 
ending his year three games early.
But now, with another year of ex-
perience and maturation under his belt and the memories of a 4-8 season fresh on his mind, Morrison is think-ing about one thing.
“I just want to win,” he said.
In eight games last season, Morri-
son tallied 56 total tackles, one tackle 
for loss and two quarterback hurries.
Defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-
kin sees Morrison progressing as the 
linebacker heads into his junior year.JONATHAN CZUPRYN

After three weeks of fall camp, 
coach Will Muschamp and offen-
sive coordinator Kurt Roper are 
still undecided about who will 
backup Jeff Driskel at quarter-back this season.
Freshmen Treon Harris and 
Will Grier are the expected front-runners for the No. 2 spot. How-ever, Muschamp said Friday that three players are still in competi-tion, which would mean redshirt 
sophomore Skyler Mornhinweg 
is still in the running.
“All three of those guys have 
done a nice job and all three of those guys bring good things 
to the table and we just need to 
make the best decision for Flori-da,” said Muschamp, who is en-tering his fourth year at UF.
The coaching staff was sched-
uled to meet Sunday night to have “lengthy discussions” about the backup position.
On Friday, Muschamp said he 
would like to take out Driskel by the second quarter of Florida’s opener against Idaho on Saturday in order to give the No. 2 quar-terback meaningful reps early in the year, which Muschamp did in 2011.On Sept. 3, 2011, John Brantley 
started Florida’s opener against Florida Atlantic but was replaced by then-backup Driskel with 6:04 remaining in the second quarter. However, after Driskel threw an interception in his first collegiate pass attempt, Muschamp went right back to Brantley to finish the half.
Driskel re-entered the contest 
midway through the fourth quar-ter when Florida had a decisive 38-3 lead.
Starting offensive guards un-
decided: Trip Thurman, Trenton Brown and Tyler Moore are still in competition for the two open guard positions.
Muschamp announced Friday 
that Max Garcia will start at cen-ter and D.J. Humphries and Chaz Green will start at left and right 
tackle, respectively.
David Sharpe, who missed 
all last week with a high-ankle 
sprain, and Rod Johnson are ex-pected to see time on the line on 
Saturday.
Juco transfer Drew Sarvary 
has taken reps at center through-
out fall camp and will possibly 
provide Garcia with relief against 
Idaho.
Garcia, a redshirt senior, 
played left tackle and guard last season but made the switch to 
center after the Gators lost Jonot-
than Harrison to graduation. 
The Maryland transfer had 
never played center before in his playing career, and it showed during spring ball when he strug-

Despite back-to-back weather delayed 
games, eighth-ranked Florida completed 
the sweep of their pair of weekend in-state 
rivalry matches, defeating South Florida 
2-0 on Sunday.
The last time UF (2-0) and USF (0-2) faced 
each other, the game ended in a 1-1 tie that 
went into double overtime. Sunday’s game 
was almost as evenly matched throughout the first half, despite Florida having five shots and South Florida having none.
Perhaps what gave the Gators the push 
they needed was the one hour and forty minute rain delay that came early in the second half.
“I do think we are the veterans of rain 
delay now,” Florida coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“We got into a little bit of a funk there 
in the beginning of the second half, before 
the rain delay, where we sort of just lost our 
way a little bit. And then when we had a chance to regroup and get back to the plan, we were fine.”
The Gators were a bit more than fine 
following the long delay. 
They came out ready to play and ready 
to make up for what they  lacked in the first half.
Florida’s first goal 
came in the 67th minute when the ball found the feet of senior midfielder 
Annie Speese inside the 18-yard box off 
a pass from sophomore midfielder Liz 
Slattery.
The Augusta, Ga., native then recorded 
her second goal in the 84th minute when 
she finished another cross sent perfectly Florida shuts out South Florida

JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
My senses tell the story of college foot-
ball better than I can. The stimula-tion that runs stupendously deep for 
months on end is the most tangible reminder that this sport is more than a game played by 
young men, but a living, breathing right of 
autumn. As sure as I am that the leaves will change, I’m equally as conﬁ  dent that a touch-down pass will bring a visceral reaction from my core.
I miss hearing the violent symphony of 
power and speed that envelope Saturdays for months. I yearn for the crack of shoulder pads when a special hit that separates receiver from 
ball can be heard even from high above in my 
perch in the press deck. 
I miss seeing the colors on the way to the 
stadiums on various campuses across the southeast. The masses of orange and blue that move up and down West University Avenue, or the split directly down the middle in Jack-sonville on October’s ﬁ  nal weekend during the cocktail party. The bright orange in Knoxville, Tenn., that enters via na-val procession is a 
sight to behold.
Allow me to 
be journalistically 
nerdy for a spell when I say I miss 
the touch of my ﬁ  ngers on my keyboard as they race across it with a deadline to meet and the challenge of turning the story of a football game into 750 words of pure poetry.
I miss the smell of my roommates cooking 
cheap Sam’s Club burgers bought in bulk, and I miss the taste too, although I know it proba-bly knocks years off of my life with every bite.
But ﬁ  nally, mercifully, it’s back. It has been 
a long, tedious offseason that seemed to plod along with the pace of a drunken sloth trapped in quicksand even with the distraction that was the World Cup. 
This summer, I worked on my golf game 
and spent time with my loved ones, both pur-suits have now driven me to near lunacy, and I need a diversion — a return to normalcy.
Saturday morning I, like many of you, will 
wake up and watch College Gameday. I know Lee Corso’s a little senile now, but he’s part of the family. He’s just like your drunken grand-father on Thanksgiving that puts the turkey on his head and waves as thousands cheer — wait, you don’t have a grandpa like that? Sorry to hear that your family’s boring.
For years, College Gameday has been the 
brunchtime soundtrack for those getting ready to head out for a day of tailgating — or those already there with the possession of a satellite dish, it’s back too.
I wish there was a way to turn the brain 
capacity Gators fans have devoted to the ques-tion “how’s Florida going to do,” into a renew-able energy source. We could end our global energy crisis for eons. In ﬁ  ve days, you’ll be able to ﬁ  nd out.
I breathe easily knowing I’ve made it to 
the ﬁ  nal stretch with the ﬁ  nish line in sight. Florida fans should rest assured that there was 
only one minor legal issue the whole offseason 
and no major injuries unlike last season. Those are big achievements in and of themselves.
What part of my American human nature 
makes me love this sport the way I do? Is it the appeal of sanctioned violence? The thirst for chaos? Maybe the nobler endeavor of watch-ing underdogs pull off upsets? Perhaps I enjoy players my own age rising to immeasurable 
moments of pressure in front of thousands in 
the stands and millions watching on televi-sion?
I’m not sure what the answer is, but I am 
sure that I don’t necessarily need to know. What I do need is some sensory overload, and I’ll get it this weekend at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium.

Limiting the amount of shots on goal 
your opponent attempts during a match is 
signiﬁ  cant, but allowing no goals is key.
With three members of Florida’s back-
line from 2013 — Tessa Andujar, Christen Westphal and Claire Falknor — playing on opening weekend, the Gators’ defense 
continued to prevent opponents from at-
tacking and scoring on their goal.  
After opening the season with a 3-0 vic-
tory over Miami, No. 8 Florida defeated South Florida 2-0 to record back-to-back 
shutout victories.
However, shutouts aren’t anything new 
for this Gators club.
The backline of Andujar, Westphal, Fal-
knor and senior Karina Gutsche limited 
opponents to a total of 15 goals in 2013, which was the third-lowest total in pro-gram history and the lowest amount of goals allowed since surrendering 12 in the 
2007 season.
Last season, 13 of Florida’s 18 wins 
came in shutout fashion.
“For us, defending starts from the very 
front forward, but for sure the backline 
takes a lot of pride in shutouts and I think our whole team does,” coach Becky Bur-leigh said. 
“They (the backline) get a lot of help 
when people double down back after the ball goes past them, and the more we con-tinue to grow in that team defense the bet-ter we’re going to be.”Florida continued that relentless style 
of defense through its ﬁ  rst two games of 2014, limiting Miami to one shot on goal and South Florida to three. 
Meanwhile, the Gators have registered 
29 shots — 14 of which were on goal — and turned in ﬁ  ve goals through two games.
As it has done in the past, logging in shutouts is something Florida does excep-
tionally well. 
During the 2013 season, the Gators had 
two winning streaks compiled of shutouts. 
The ﬁ  rst was a four-game route and the 
second was increased to six.
The backline acknowledges its role 
when the ball is pressed into its territory, and it resulted in an above average job done by the defenders.
“We’re working really hard in practice 
on defense, staying together and just com-
municate a lot,” Andujar said. “We know 
where each other is supposed to go and 
communication is the best thing to do in our defense.”
Andujar and her fellow defenders last 
season created a backline that averaged a 
0.61 goals against average, which was the 
program’s third lowest mark.
However, the defenders have not done 
it by themselves.
Senior goalkeeper Taylor Burke has con-
sistently defended her turf and is climbing a shutout mark of her own.
Burke captured her 25th solo shutout 
as keeper on Sunday and inched her way 
closer to the school record of 27, which is 
owned by Katie Fraine. 
In 2013, Burke paced the Southeastern 
Conference with a .825 saves percentage 
and a .543 goals-against average, the lat-
ter of which broke a program record set in 
1999. 
With a six-game road stretch approach-
ing — including contests against No. 2 
Florida State and No. 6 Stanford — the ac-
countability of the backline defense will be put to the test.
“It shouldn’t be that I trust them more 
than they trust themselves,” Burleigh said. “I explicitly trust if they stick with the plan, that they all know how to execute we will be ﬁ  ne.”32, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014

Tim Walton said it best on 
April 15.
“I really like our team,” the 
ninth-year coach said. “Are we talented enough to win the Wom-en’s College World Series? I think yes. Are we capable of that? I think yes.”
Forty-nine days later, Walton’s 
thoughts were conﬁ  rmed, as No. 5 seed Florida (55-12) defeated second-seeded Alabama (53-13) 6-3 on June 3 to sweep the Crim-son Tide and win the ﬁ  rst national championship in Gators softball history.
“This is kind of a surreal mo-
ment for me right now sitting up here with Hannah and the other kids that bought into it this year,” Walton said.After senior Hannah Rogers 
started and ﬁ  nished Florida’s ﬁ  rst four games in the Women’s Col-lege World Series — giving up 
just three runs in 26 innings of 
work — Walton decided to roll the dice and give Lauren Haeger 
the start in the circle.
“It’s a three-game series, and 
that’s how we’ve been doing it all 
year,” Haeger said. “Hannah has been doing great, and I told my 
team and told Hannah, ‘I’m going 
to go as long and as hard as I can,’ 
and I knew I had two pitchers be-
hind me that we’re going to shut everyone down, too.”
Haeger struggled in the ﬁ  rst 
inning, giving up back-to-back 
singles to start the contest and 
surrendering a one-out RBI single to Alabama right ﬁ  elder Jadyn 
Spencer to give the Crimson Tide 
an early 1-0 lead.
Florida responded in the bot-
tom half of the frame with senior Stephanie Tofft launching a Jaclyn Traina pitch over the left-ﬁ  eld fence for a two-out home run to even the score.
The Gators tacked on four 
more runs in the second inning, three of which came from a Kirsti Merritt blast to left ﬁ  eld — her 
second long ball of the Women’s 
College World Series — to extend 
Florida’s lead to 5-1 and force 
Traina out of the circle after just 1.1 innings of work. UF plated its 
ﬁ  nal run in the sixth inning when 
Tofft scored Stewart on a ﬁ  elder’s 
choice.
Haeger surrendered a two-out 
home run in the third inning, but 
limited the damage to one in her 
ﬁ  nal full inning of work. The Peo-
ria, Ariz., native was relieved by 
freshman lefty Delanie Gourley after giving up a leadoff single to 
Traina in the fourth inning.
Gourley, in her ﬁ  rst appear-
ance in the circle since throw-
ing a no-hitter against FAMU in UF’s ﬁ  rst game of NCAA action, pitched two scoreless innings to earn her 15th win of the season while Rogers earned her second save of the year by pitching the 
ﬁ  nal two frames.
“We don’t have a superstar 
on our team,” Walton said. “We 
have a bunch of players that do 
their job, and today was a tribute 
to that.  We got a Lauren qual-
ity start, Delanie gets the ‘W’ and Hannah gets the save. … For all of 
them to be a part of the this Na-
tional Championship game was 
something very, very special.”
The Gators started the season 
with 22 straight wins, topping 
four ranked teams and shutting 
out seven teams in the process.
But after reaching the South-
eastern Conference portion of its schedule, Florida hit a slump, go-
ing just 15-9 in league play to ﬁ  n-
ish in a three-way tie for third one 
year after winning the conference 
outright.
Florida wasn’t at its high point at the end of the regular season. It went one-and-out in the SEC Tournament, a 2-0 loss to Georgia that became the turning point of 
the season.
“The Georgia loss was good for 
us,” Walton said before WCWS 
action began. “We actually got a 
couple days off and got humbled 
with our offense, so I think that 
helped us. We realized we had to make adjustments and do things 
different offensively and I think 
that was good.”
Florida ﬁ  nished its 11-game 
journey through the NCAA Tour-nament by outscoring opponents 
82-10 with eight shutouts.
“Most teams set goals to win 
every series or win the SEC or do 
some things and this team actu-ally set a goal to win a national 
championship,” Walton said. “It’s 
the ﬁ  rst one we’ve ever talked 
about in my coaching … but this 
team felt like we had the parts and the pieces to do it.”

In the end, Florida (40-22) just couldn’t 
get timely hits after stranding 13 on base, 
and its season came to a waterlogged end 
against North Carolina (35-26) losing 5-3.
For a few minutes in the second inning, 
though, baseball did not matter when Tar 
Heel shortstop Michael Russell took a 
pitch directly off the left side of his batting 
helmet.
The crack of the plastic stunned the 
1,855 in attendance at McKethan stadium and blood poured out of a gash in Rus-
sell’s temple. He was walked to the lock-
er room by trainers with a towel pressed firmly against his head.
After a 15-minute delay, Russell was 
deemed unfit to come back in the game, and Zach Daly took his place. 
Russell received 13 stitches but after 
the game tweeted, “Finally got my light-ning bolt scar #Gryffindor #TheBoyWhoL-
ived.”
“It definitely wasn’t easy (losing Rus-
sell),” UNC right fielder Tyler Ramirez 
said. 
“We were pretty disappointed Michael 
had to exit quickly, but I don’t think it re-ally effected us at all. We wanted to really get it for Michael and get the win. I think we all just really rallied around it.”In the next inning — for the second day 
in a row — the Gators had to wait around while Mother Nature dished out her worst, this time to the tune of a three hour and nineteen minute rain delay. 
When they returned to the field, it was 
too long of a wait for starting pitcher Bobby Poyner, and left-hander Kirby Snead took the ball with a man on first and second and 
only one out after play resumed.
“We felt good during the rain delay that 
we were going to start him,” O’Sullivan 
said. 
“We talked about if we gave up a run 
or two that’s fine we still (were) going to have to score if we thought we were going to win.”
The Tar Heels proceeded to shell Snead 
to the tune of four hits and five runs and the Gators went through another post-rain delay nightmare inning.
After a three hour and fifteen minute 
delay before a pitch was even thrown Fri-
day, College of Charleston had three runs 
and seven hits, ballooning UF’s aggregate total to 11 hits and eight runs in the 1.2 in-nings directly following precipitation.
Florida finally broke through to score in 
the seventh, when previously hitless Zack Powers (0-3, three strikeouts) laced a ball to center field for a two-out RBI single. 
Unfortunately, thanks to the wet grass, 
shortstop Richie Martin slipped on his way home, and was thrown out by North Caro-lina to end the inning and the UF threat, a microcosm of the offensive frustration the Gators endured in 18 innings of regional play.
The Gators would tack on another in 
the eighth with a Casey Turgeon RBI sin-gle, and center fielder Harrison Bader was 
able to get to scoring position in the ninth 
after being hit by a pitch and then taking second on a wild pitch. 
But they were not able to pose a sig-
nificant threat to the Tar Heels, and just like that, their season came to a screeching halt.
“I’m very proud of this team,” 
O’Sullivan said. 
“I don’t want these last two games to be 
a reflection of what this team is about. We 
accomplished a lot, and I know in this day 
and age you’re always judged on how you do in the postseason — I understand that.
“But as far as the people in that locker 
room ... we’re gonna be afwul proud about what we accomplished this year.”

It was a season of breaking records and 
defying expectations.
Despite Florida’s No. 5 rank in the na-
tional preseason polls, UF fans were still 
concerned with the team losing 13 players to graduation in 2013 and replacing them with 11 freshmen.
When Florida defeated Ohio State 10-9 
on March 22 to improve to 10-2 to start the year, fans began to see the impact of the 11 new additions.
So when Florida lost in the 12-11 dou-
ble-overtime game against Northwestern on Saturday, it was a hard pill to swallow for coach Amanda O’Leary.
“I’m just really proud of our seniors, 
what they brought to the table: Their lead-ership, their love, they’re caring and I’m sad for them,” O’Leary said. “They gave so much to this program over the course of this four years for Krista (Grabher) and ﬁ  ve 
years for Cara (Canington).”
Attacker Sammi Burgess, midﬁ  elder 
Mollie Stevens and defender Caroline 
Fitzgerald — a trio of freshmen — became 
vital players for O’Leary alongside juniors 
Shannon Gilroy and Nora Barry.
Burgess was one of Florida’s biggest 
recruits before the start of the season. The 5-foot-3 attacker never lost a game during her four years at the McDonogh School in Maryland and became known at Florida for being a vital scorer when Gilroy failed to 
get to the net.
When Stevens arrived at Florida, 
O’Leary immediately moved her from at-
tacker to midﬁ  eld in an attempt to give 
other midﬁ  elders, like Sam Darcangelo and Nora Barry, a chance to rest. Stevens 
completed the season with 38 points and a reputation for her ability to score on the 
fast break.
Fitzgerald became Florida’s go-to player 
when it came down to guarding the oppo-
nent’s best scorer. She covered star-offen-
sive players like Syracuse’s Kayla Treanor and Northwestern’s Alyssa Leonard. 
The Mount Sinai, N.Y., native ﬁ  nished 
the season with the most caused turnovers on defense (22) and was tied for second 
with 30 ground balls.
Although the freshmen were the Gators’ 
biggest and most unexpected story of the 
year, Gilroy also made a splash in the la-
crosse community.
The Northport, N.Y., native broke the 
single-season record for most points (106), goals (86) and goals per game (4.15). Gilroy 
is the second-best offensive player in the 
country behind Syracuse’s Treanor.
But it wasn’t just points that Gilroy 
brought to the team. In situations like 
Saturday when Northwestern’s defense 
controlled Florida’s scoring opportunities and stopped many of their offensive pos-sessions, Gilroy used her notoriety as an offensive threat to get teammates like Bur-
gess and Barry open for easy goals.
“I need to worry more about my team-
mates more than what I need to do to get 
open because it’s always really difﬁ  cult for 
me to get off the ball and get open,” Gilroy 
said. “So I needed to be really prepared to help them and do the best I can for them.”
With the disappointment of not making 
it past the quarterﬁ  nals of the NCAA Tour-
nament, Florida will come back in 2015 with 
one goal in mind: Win a national title.
“I think the sky’s the limit for this team,” 
Canington said. “I think there is nothing 
but great things to come.”36, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 25, 2014

Unlike many of Florida’s previ-
ous tennis teams, this season had 
no highly acclaimed All-Ameri-cans and no trophies to hoist at the end of May.
But also unlike previous years, 
the future never looked more promising.
Florida’s three seniors — Alex-
andra Cercone, Soﬁ  e Oyen and Ol-ivia Janowicz — are rightly credit-ed with a majority of this season’s success. 
The trio led the Gators to a 23-6 
season and went undefeated on their home courts at the Ring Ten-
nis Complex.
But the largest takeaway from 
this past season is not Florida’s 
oldest players, but the youngest.
And their numbers speak vol-
umes.
Kourtney Keegan developed 
into one of the nation’s brightest and youngest doubles players, ﬁ  n-
ishing with a team-high 32 doubles 
wins — nine victories ahead of sec-ond-place Janowicz.
Belinda Woolcock also proved 
her worth in doubles, pairing with senior Oyen and advancing to the Round of 16 in the NCAA Doubles Championships.
And lastly, despite limited play-
ing time, Stefani Stojic managed to end the season with a perfect 8-0 record in dual match singles.
Does this give hope to next sea-
son, when Florida will be without 
graduating seniors Janowicz, Cer-
cone and Oyen?
“Absolutely,” coach Roland 
Thornqvist said after UF’s loss to UCLA in the NCAA semiﬁ  nals on May 19. “It was clearly a learning thing for (the freshmen), even for Brianna (Morgan). Brianna played (Court) 4 last year when we were 
here and today she was on the 
show court.”
Aside from Keegan’s develop-
ment in doubles, Morgan’s jump up to Court 1 in singles could prove to be a big determinant to Florida’s success next season. 
She will inherit the leadership 
reins from UF’s senior trio as she becomes the team’s oldest player.
Thornqvist thinks the experi-
ence the sophomore gained this season, while winning 29 of her 
37 singles matches, will come in 
handy.
Florida’s coach also hasn’t shied 
away from praising Morgan’s skill, athleticism and poise throughout the season.
“Look, when she trains for an 
extended period of time, she could be one of the top 3 or 4 players in 
the country, no question about 
it,” Thornqvist said. “Brianna has beaten the best players in America … so I know it’s in there.”The sophomore backed up her 
coach’s words when she faced Georgia’s Lauren Herring in the NCAA quarterﬁ  nals, beating the nation’s No. 6 singles player on her own court.
Morgan insists that it doesn’t 
matter where she plays, only how she plays — and that’s why she’s 
been so successful.
“I really haven’t found any dif-
ferences,” Morgan said. “I try to 
do the same thing I do whether I’m playing on Court 2, 1, what-ever. Just try and stick to the same thing.”
The Gators hope the same thing 
will be good enough next year, 
as they will undoubtedly rely on 
Morgan and their three rising sophomores to build on the suc-cess of this past season.

The men’s track and ﬁ  eld team 
fell just short of earning its third 
consecutive national outdoor 
championship after ﬁ  nishing sec-
ond to Oregon.
When the NCAA Champion-
ships ended Saturday, the Ducks 
ﬁ  nished the competition with 88 
points compared to the Gators’ 70.
On the women’s side, Florida 
ﬁ  nished fourth overall (55 points) 
behind eventual national cham-
pion Texas A&M (75), Texas (66) and Oregon (59).
Despite not winning a team 
title, each team still earned indi-vidual titles over the weekend. 
The men ﬁ  nished ﬁ  rst in the 
long jump, triple jump, 200m sprint and 4x100 relay.The women earned a national 
title in the javelin competition be-hind Fawn Miller’s performance (58.13m/190-8).
“We just got beat by a better 
team and same thing as far as the overall team standings,” coach Mike Holloway said. “We scored 70 points, we just got beat by a 
phenomenal Oregon team and 
we’ll be back to ﬁ  ght them again next year.”
Oregon’s track squad was the 
unit that ended a potential three-peat for Florida’s men during outdoor competition and stopped UF’s opportunity to repeat as in-door and outdoor national cham-
pions.
Florida has multiple South-
eastern Conference and national 
individual champions in both the 
indoor and outdoor seasons with 
the men and women.
The women’s team has in-
creased its ability to be a contend-er in not just running events, but on the ﬁ  eld too.
Throughout the 2014 cam-
paign, the nation witnessed a top-ranked team in Florida on both 
sides at various points through-
out the season.
Although rankings don’t mat-
ter at the end of the day and from 
the words of Holloway, the only 
ranking that matters is the one at the end of the season, the 12th-year head coach is looking to the future instead of dwelling on the 
past.
“Some things didn’t go our 
way, but we can’t talk about that. 
What we have to talk about is 
we’re on this — we were third in-doors, fourth (women) outdoors,” 
Holloway said.
“Now we have to be a trophy 
team every year. That has to be 
our goal, to come in here and be a 
part of the conversation about be-ing a national championship team and I think we’re headed in the right direction.”
The women’s team is up and 
rising and the men will lose only two seniors who have stamped their name on Florida’s track and 
ﬁ  eld program.
The void to ﬁ  ll on the men’s 
side would be Eddie Lovett — the 
only athlete to win the 60-meter hurdles in the SEC four consecu-
tive times — and Sean Obinwa, 
who was a skilled mentor to the 800-meter crew, which has much talent moving ahead. 
The women will lose Cory Mc-
Gee — a 10-time All-American throughout her four-year career at UF — and Ebony Eutsey, who earned All-America recognition as a 400-meter sprinter and as a part of UF’s 4x400-meter relay team.
With senior leaders leaving 
their legacy at Florida, the team certainly still has plenty of talent.
The men’s squad still has argu-
ably their best jumper in program history in Marquis Dendy, who 
was the ﬁ  rst since 2002 to be a 
double national champion in the long jump and triple jump.
UF also boasts one of the best 
4x4 relay squads in Najee Glass, Hugh Graham Jr., Dedric Dukes and Arman Hall — a relay squad that, at one point in the season, set the world-leading time in the 
4x4 during the Florida Relays, 
and Dedric Dukes owned the 200-meter run with the world-leading time as well.
“I’m very proud of my group, 
very proud of what they accom-plished all year long,” Holloway said. “I’m excited about getting back to work.”

Florida had 14 shots on goal in opening weekend shutouts
from the outside, making it Speese’s fifth double-goal 
match of her collegiate career.
“It was just execution,” Speese said. “Tessa [Andujar] 
and Lauren [Smith] were working them down the end line the whole game and we finally got on the end of a couple of their crosses.”
Speese’s second goal also came on the advantage of 
USF playing down a man because of a red card issued to junior defender Diana Saenz. 
Her ejection gave the Gators an 11-on-10 advantage, 
which they then exploited.
The Gators continued to create opportunities for 
themselves on offense, taking six shots on goal against the Bulls as well as eight in their game on Friday against Miami.
“I thought we really did a great job today of having 
good numbers in the box,” Burleigh said. “We have to still get better at our execution of services and our ability to receive the service.”
Not to be overlooked by the offense is the Florida 
defense. The Gators finished the weekend with two shutout 
victories, thanks to the strong play from the Florida back line. Senior defender Tessa Andujar, who also recorded an assist in Sunday’s win, has been an important piece of that defense.
“We’re working really hard in practice on defense,” 
Andujar said. “We just communicate a lot. We know where each other goes and communication is the best thing to do in our defense.”
Florida emerges from their first weekend of games 
with a 2-0 record and a strong start to their season.
“It’s great,” Speese said. “But, obviously, it’s two 
games in. It’s a long season, so we’re just going to go to practice this week and watch some film, see what we need 
to work on and keep moving forward from here.” recap , from page 29

Linebackers, defensive line look to improve communication
“He has always been a guy very serious 
about football, practices hard and all those 
things,” Durkin said. 
“I think he has taken that to another 
level. His preparation off the field is as strong as it is on the field.”
Added senior defensive lineman Dari-
ous Cummings: “I feel he’s still the same playmaker, still bringing the same intensi-ty. … Tony’s the vocal leader on this team and he’s going to say his part and I feel like he’s doing a better job than he did last 
year.”
For Morrison, the key to success among 
the linebackers is having sound commu-
nication with the defensive linemen up front.
“As a linebacker, it’s important to have 
a great relationship with your defensive line because they’re right in front of you,” Morrison said. 
“I mean, you don’t want to be back 
there giving a guy a hard time because then they wouldn’t want to be playing in front of you.”
Cummings feels his relationship with 
Morrison on the field is going in the right direction.
“Me and him are clicking real well,” 
Cummings said. 
“We compliment each other on every-
thing we do. Whenever he makes a tackle, I give him a high-five. He gives me a high five whenever I shed a block. I feel like the defensive line and the linebackers are all 
on the same page a lot more than we were 
last year.”
And outside of Morrison, the rest of the 
linebacker corps is also brimming with tal-
ent.
Sophomore Jarrad 
Davis — who tallied 
at least five tackles in each of Florida’s final 
three games of 2013 — is expected to get the nod at the weak-side linebacker posi-tion.
Add redshirt seniors Mike Taylor and 
Neiron Ball into the mix and coach Will Muschamp has a solid group of players with the potential to wreak havoc on op-posing offenses.“I mean, you know, I’m not sitting 
there looking to find one guy out there,” the fourth-year head coach said. “I think all four of those guys can play winning football for us. I have confidence in all four 
guys.”
Behind those four are two up-and-
coming sophomores in Alex Anzalone and 
Daniel McMillian.
The two spent most of their playing 
time on special teams last season but have made strides throughout training camp.
“They don’t have as much playing expe-
rience, but I feel really good about where 
they’re at,” Durkin said. “They’ve done a 
great job with their snaps, they’ve really improved.”

The Gators football team has 
made it through the dog days of 
summer and the grind of fall camp, and game week is ﬁ  nally here. Flor-ida will face Idaho on Saturday to 
open its 2014 season.
Offensive Personnel Progress-
ing: Florida’s new up-tempo, spread 
offense under offensive coordinator 
Kurt Roper is taking shape. The run-ning back corps with Mack Brown, Kelvin Taylor and Matt Jones re-turning makes the position the deepest it’s been since Muschamp 
has been in Gainesville.  
He added that he is also pleased 
with the development of the receiv-
ing corps.
“I feel very good about the run-
ning back position. I think we have a lot of good depth,” Muschamp said. “I feel very good about the re-ceiver position, a lot of good depth. 
I think Clay Burton and Jake McGee 
have both distanced themselves at tight end a little bit and Jeff Driskel at quarterback.”
Driskel has improved signiﬁ  -
cantly within the new system. Being in the shotgun as opposed to under center has made him more efﬁ  cient, especially running the football.
“He’s been very good with the 
ball. I don’t think any team periods, we’ve had a turnover with Jeff,” Muschamp said. “I think there may have been one in a 1-on-1 on a de-ﬂ  ected pass, so he’s been very good with the ball and making good deci-sions.”
Secondary starters still undeter-
mined: The only two set positions in Florida’s secondary are Vernon Har-greaves III at cornerback and soph-omore Keanu Neal at safety. There are a number of different guys that can rotate between nickel and cor-ner, as well as nickel and safety.
“Jabari Gorman he can play 
nickel, he can play safety. Marcus 
(Maye) can play nickel, can play 
safety. Brian Poole can play corner, he can play nickel,” Muschamp said. “So those guys will all cross-train throughout the year.”
True freshmen Jalen Tabor,  J.C. 
Jackson and Quincy Wilson have been repping at cornerback too.
But regardless of who starts the 
game, Muschamp said players will still get the reps they earned.
“I think settle is going to be the 
ﬁ  rst series and after that we’re going to be rolling in there because all of those guys have earned the right to have the opportunity to step on the ﬁ  eld and play,” Muschamp said.”I have conﬁ  dence in all of them and I 
think that as we move closer to game 
week a lot of times in my experience that’s where you create a little more separation the anxiety of game day and how those guys handle the situ-ation.” 
Injury Update: After an injury-plagued season a year ago, the Gators have remained healthy for the most part throughout fall camp. 
Offensive lineman David Sharpe 
will return to practice today, and Maye will be back Tuesday or Wednesday.
“We only had two soft-tissue is-
sues in all of camp. That’s outstand-
ing,” Muschamp said. “That’s the 
best I’ve been around, as opposed to last year, I think we only had three as far as hamstrings, groins, those sort of things and hernias. That tells you we’re training the right way.”
Linebacker Matt Rolin, who un-
derwent his second ACL tear just a year ago, continues to progress.

Roper wants to have a six-player rotation at wide receiver
gled getting off the snap.
However, new offensive line coach 
Mike Summers has worked with Garcia 
throughout fall camp to improve his deliv-
ery to Driskel in the shotgun formation — and it seems to be paying off.
“There’s no question he was the right 
guy for the job,” Muschamp said. “He’s very decisive in his decision-making. He is off the charts intelligent and a guy that has really done a nice job through camp 
snapping it. 
“(He) had struggled a little bit there 
early in spring, but I think he’s done a fan-
tastic job.”
Receiver rotation: Roper said the 
Gators could implement a six-man rota-tion in the wide receiving corps for 2014, but Muschamp said that might depend on both the opponent and the weather.
“It’s pretty hot 
here, and it’s going to be hot next Saturday,” Muschamp said. “I 
don’t care if it’s at 7 o’clock or not.”
Quinton Dunbar, Ahmad Fulwood and 
Demarcus Robinson are expected to start on the outside regardless of the type of ro-tation Muschamp and Roper use.
Latroy Pittman Jr., Andre Debose, Chris 
Thompson, Valdez Showers and C.J. Wor-
ton are all battling for playing time in the 
slot.
