Islam Fairaims to break down stereotypes
Nora Zaki, left, and Tasnia Osmani, right, served food at the Islam Fair on Monday afternoon.* ABOUT 200 PEOPLE WENT
TO THE EVENT MONDAY.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Students snacked on hum-
mus and listened to the sounds
of devotional chants at the Islam
Fair Monday on the Reitz Union
North Lawn.
The fair is a celebration of Is-
lam Awareness Month at UF. It
continues today starting at 10:30
a.m. and is sponsored by UF's Is-
lam on Campus.
Karim Khan, the vice presi-
dent of external affairs for Islam
on Campus, said about 200 peo-
ple stopped by the tent Monday
to ask questions, peruse through
cultural artifacts and sample eth-
nic cooking.
Khan said the fair helps to
raise awareness about the Islamic
culture and dismiss any precon-
ceived stereotypes people may
have about the religion."A lot of people think of us as
angry people with big beards,"
said Khan, who is half Pakistani
and half Irish. "We want to show
[people] that Muslims are their
neighbors and that they're good
people."
Hanging around the tents
were traditional garments and
religious decorations as well as
photos of famous Muslims, such
as Malcolm X, Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar, Zinedine Zidane and Cat
Stevens, now known as Yusuf Is-
lam. Across from the tent, tables
were set up representing differ-
ent Islamic countries.
Guests were encouraged to
take free samples of literature,
including copies of the Quran as
well as sample pita bread, hum-
mus and grape leaves filled with
rice.
UF freshmen Nora Zaki and
Tasnia Osmani helped serve the
free samples.
"I feel burgers are everywhere,
but this isn't," Osmani said. "This
offers something different."

SEC app lists traditions
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Die-hard Southeastern Conference fans
have a new way to satisfy their appetites for
histories and traditions.
The College Kids, a company started by
two Mississippi State University students in
an entrepreneurship class, has released a new
iPhone application called "College Rites,"
which features a checklist of more than 50 tra-
ditions from SEC schools.
The app, which costs 99 cents, has been out
for two weeks. More than 40 have been sold,
with 18 selling last week.
Co-owner and co-designer Christina
Young, a chemical engineering senior, said the
idea came from a trip she took to Auburn Uni-
versity for a football game.
She didn't understand the tradition sur-
rounding Toomer's Corner, a street corner
where students hang rolls of toilet paper from
two trees after an athletic win.
She saw the need for the information to be
easily available.
"It'll provide a good database for people tolook at and learn about the different schools,"
Young said.
The app allows people to search a database
of SEC school traditions and histories, and it
gives users the option of posting YouTube
links and pictures of themselves completing
the traditions.
"It's an SEC-focused app. It'll pro-
vide a good database for people to
look at and learn about the differ-
ent schools."
Christina Young
app co-designer
Users can also rank their favorite traditions
and post smack talk on a message board.
"The message board will promote a spirit
of rivalry," Young said.
UF advertising junior Jessica Keys said she
liked the idea but wouldn't get the app unless
it was free.
"It's more for the students who are really
into going to the away games," she said.Parties fill exec spots

The Unite Party and the Student
Alliance party have filled all the seats
on their executive tickets.
On the Unite Party ticket, Senate
President Ashton Charles is running
for Student Body president. Marcus
Dixon is the candidate for vice presi-
dent, and Virlany Taboada is running
for treasurer.
For the Student Alliance party, Ben
Cavataro is the candidate for Student
Body president. Sagar Sane is running
for vice president, and Rafael Yaniz is
the candidate for treasurer.
Charles said she is honored to cam-
paign with Dixon and Taboada and
would not have chosen anyone else as
her running mates.
"We make a really phenomenalteam, and we all really care about the
university," Charles said.
Cavataro said the Student Alliance
party wanted to put together a list of
candidates with as much real-world
experience as possible, and he feels
that goal was accomplished by adding
Yaniz and Sane to its executive ticket.
Cavataro said running against the
Unite Party can-
Student didates is not go-Government ing to change the
Student Alliance
party's campaign strategy.
"I think we have the most diverse
ticket in terms of the experience of our
members," Cavataro said.
Charles said the Unite Party will
not be making any changes to cam-
paign strategies either."I wish them the best of luck,"
Charles said.

Fred Gmitter developed Sugar Belle, and says the fruit "makes you happy when you eat it."
UF's Sugar Belle is sweet success
Sugar Belle, a name meaning sweet and beautiful, is the first University of Florida-created
citrus variety intended for commercial production.
Fred Gmitter, UF professor of citrus breeding and genetics, worked many years for Sugar
Belle, a bold mandarin orange hybrid, to be where it is today.
Hired in 1985 as a UF assistant professor, Gmitter soon noticed a neglected block of trees left
behind by a retired professor.
"I tasted (the fruit on) every tree-most were horrible," said Gmitter. "Then I tasted fruit
from this one tree and it was phenomenal." The tree is now known as Sugar Belle.
Gmitter then began propagating the tree, knowing that he had found a valuable citrus
selection.
One of the first large-scale field trials was on the east coast of Florida.
But after growing for a few years, a setback occurred. Citrus canker, a highly contagious disease
that attacks fruit, was found near the trees. The entire group had to be burned.
"That was really devastating," Gmitter said.
That didn't stop the determined Gmitter and soon, after producing more crops, taste trials
began. Sugar Belle won "big-time" as the favorite among the taste-testers, he said.
It is a very bold, rich-tasting citrus with high levels of sugar. "Makes you happy when you eat
it," he said.
Sugar Belle has numerous benefits that make it stand out from other competitors. It has a high
percentage of vitamin C, ripens four to six weeks earlier than other varieties of citrus and it has
shown a greater tolerance to the fungus Alternaria.
After long hours and hard work, Gmitter is really satisfied with Sugar Belle. But now the rest is
out of his hands.
"It's like when you first take your kids to kindergarten. You are still attached but you have to
let them go-I have that feeling about Sugar Belle," said Gmitter. "Didn't expect that feeling, but
it's strange. It's like having a 25-year-old kid."

Sewage may soon be passing
through the city of Waldo faster

If given the green light, the city
of Waldo, which is infamous for
being one of the nation's worst
speed traps, will pay for most of
the construction costs of an 11.5-
mile wastewater pipeline.
In a meeting Monday
night among members of the

opment Committee, Gainesville
Regional Utilities Board and
representatives from the city of
Waldo, city manager and officialstentatively agreed to move for-
ward on the project that would
allow Waldo to build the pipeline
along U.S. 301 between Waldo
and Gainesville.
Official approval for the es-
timated $5 million project is ex-
pected to come within two weeks,
Gainesville
Gainesville City Commission-
Government er Scherwin

The city of Waldo will use a
governmental stimulus fund to
cover construction costs, accord-

limits by the town's nearly 800
residents, Waldo City Manager

Signing Gators get game gigs
Theyi/ will szhn luring anthpM audience Lnn said However
By ERICA COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Members of Signing Gators are
lending their hands at UF gymnas-
tics meets, basketball games and
baseball games to sign the national
anthem while it is being sung.
Alyssa Lunin, a former American
Sign Language teaching assistant,
came up with the idea to bring sign
language to the games.
Lunin said she wanted to com-
bine her passion for sign language
and her love of sports.She contacted the University Ath-
letic Association to pitch her idea.
The signers vary from students
enrolled in American Sign Lan-
guage 1 to
Spotlight on the advanced
Swamp former stu-
dents and
teaching assistants.
Alexandra Klein, the treasurer
of Signing Gators, said four signers
perform at each game.
"The first couple of times per-
forming were definitely nerve-
racking, especially with peers in theexceed, and it just makes more sense to collaborate on
this," Charles said.
Ricardo Marenco, the fraternity's vice president, said
eight members of the fraternity plan on donating plasma
Saturday. The fraternity hopes to raise at least $300 by
the end of the drive, Marenco said.
The fraternity will be tabling on Turlington Plaza
with donation jars from seven other student organiza-
tions. The organization that earns the most money from
tabling and plasma donations will receive prizes such
as gift cards and free food from Chipotle Mexican Grill,
Marenco said.
Charles said other organizations can still join the
fundraising efforts.
after a couple of times, the nervous-
ness goes away.
The signers could eventually per-
form at other athletic events.
Martin Salamone, UAA Assistant
Athletics Director of marketing, said
the signers could perform at football
games depending on how the sign-
ers' performances go this semester.
"It's all about making sure our
fans have the best possible experi-
ence," Salamone said.
The signers' next performance
will be at the men's basketball game
against Mississippi State University
on Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

0 GAI N ESVI LLE'S COLD EST JAN UARY WAS I N
1940.
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Last month's cold weather left Gainesville residents turning
up their heaters and scrambling to buy gloves and scarves. But
this January wasn't the coldest one the city has seen.
Although at the start of the year Gainesville had its coldest
two-week period in climate history, the average monthly tem-
perature did not exceed previous records, according to an e-
mail from National Weather Service Meteorologist Jason Hess.
According to Hess, the city's average temperature in Janu-
ary, 49 degrees Fahrenheit, was 5.3 degrees below normal and
tied as the third coldest January since 1903. The coldest January
in Gainesville was in 1940, when the average was 46 degrees.
The city's all-time low was 10 degrees on Jan. 21, 1985.
Hess said there were 15 days last month when temperatures
reached 32 degrees or lower. The lowest temperature, 17 de-
grees on Jan. 11, was the city's fifth coldest day recorded.
According to Hess, the National Weather Service expects
temperatures in Gainesville to be lower than average in Febru-
ary, March and April.
"While we are not expecting that kind of cold snap in Febru-
ary, subfreezing temperatures will remain possible," he said.
NWS predicts freezing weather in Gainesville to end within
a matter of weeks.

Sore Losers
Taylor Swift deserved
her award
L eave poor Taylor Swift alone.
We're tired of reading your Facebook statuses
proclaiming how "Beyonce had one of the best vid-
eos of all time" a la Kanye West.
We don't want to hear any more of your complaining
about how Lady Gaga is the best thing to happen to music
since Michael Jackson died (too soon?).
And we're tired of reading endless comments about
how the Grammys sucked more than a sour lemon.
If all of you were so pissed about Swift's triumph over
our Lady Gaga, (we also unabashedly adore her and her
all-new twist to the phrase "camel toe") stop watching and
flip on Leno or Conan.
Oh, wait.
Whatever you think about the 20-year-old, "Love
Story"-crooning country music crossover, let's get a few
things straight.
Swift's album "Fearless" was the highest selling album
of 2009. The Associated Press named Swift as 2009's enter-
tainer of the year. And the release of her latest album saw
the largest opening U.S. sales week in 2008 by a female
artist in any genre of music.
That's a big deal, especially for a 20-year-old country
singer.
And you're bashing the girl who got dumped by one of
the Jonas Brothers. Seriously?
We love "The Fame" and "The Fame Monster" as much
as the next guy. In fact, "Bad Romance" might be on repeat
on several of our playlists.
But the facts speak for themselves.
We're sorry, Gaga, and we're going to let you finish,
but Taylor had one of the best albums of all time.
Come on, Phil
he Editorial Board isgoing to try something
new today.
Instead of our usual pleas
to the Student Body, Student
Government, Bernie Machen
or anyone else who annoys
us (which turns out to be
quite an extensive list), we're
going to try and bargain with
one of the most famous furry
friends in the nation.
That's right, Punxsutaw-
ney Phil, we're talking to
you.
Now, we realize whether
or not Phil sees his shadow
will probably have zero ef-
fect on the weather, but just
go with us here, OK?
We're sick and tired of
the cold, and our paychecks
are far too small to allowus to purchase new winter
clothes.
Let's recap the kind of
winter we've had thus far.
January showed re-
cord lows for the city of
Gainesville. Local farmers
had problems with frozen
crops. We even suffered a
mitten shortage.
And even though we had
temperatures as low as 17
degrees, Gainesville didn't
even get a little snow.
So please, we're begging
you, Phil, Mother Nature or
to whomever we should be
directing this editorial: Cut
us Floridians a little slack be-
cause we can't take the cold
anymore.
There's a reason we go to
school in the Sunshine State.

Ending relationships has its positives
Breakups aren't fun. In fact, as far as things in rela-tionships go, they pretty much suck.
To be clear, I'm generally a proponent of ending
relationships that aren't right. Being with a partner who
is willfully manipulative, ungrateful or selfish can have a
toxic effect on your life and the lives of those around you.
Being with a partner whom you constantly find yourself
tolerating more than appreciating is unfair to both your
partner and anyone who'd be willing to offer your part-
ner something more than mere tolerance. And staying
in a relationship with someone you love but with whom
you are fundamentally incompatible is a recipe for frus-
tration and tear-soaked confusion.
While every situation is different, I think it's generally
a good idea to at least consider ending any relationship
that falls under those broad categories. But just because
it's a good idea doesn't mean it hurts any less when the
breakup happens.
Breakups, after all, can be horrifying. Discovering that
your love is no longer wanted, is no longer good enough
or never even existed can make you feel lonely. If the
breakup is with someone about whom you genuinely
cared, it can be an unusual type of pain that feels like the
only person who can help you is the one who hurt you,
and it feels ridiculous even thinking that -as ridiculous
as getting stabbed and then asking your assailant if he or
she has any gauze you can borrow.
But it's not all bad.
Breakups give us a sort of emotional credibility. Af-
ter all, it's a statement about how we feel for those we
care about even after being hurt. It's one thing to be will-
ing to take a chance and leave ourselves vulnerable if
we haven't been stung; it's an entirely different thing to
know how much it could hurt and still be open to it.
And there's some comfort in knowing that, as unique
and personal as a breakup feels, we are not alone. Theseare the same feelings that dot, in
some fashion, the millennia of hu-
man history. The feelings that come
with getting a "We need to talk" text
message know no temporal bound-
aries. Heartache, apprehension and
Joe Dellosa loss are very old parts of who we
letters@alligator org are. To wit, even Abe Lincoln had
his Ann Rutledge -though, admit-
tedly, that was less a breakup than
a fatal fever. It still must've hurt, though.
If nothing else, breakups connect us in a very vibrant
way. Relationships with people of all ages, races, reli-
gions and sexual orientations all involve breakups -and
there's a strong kinship that can be formed with the uni-
versal truism that breakups are a bitch. We all know that
breakups are painful, and knowing that provides good
motivation for us to be there for each other.
Remembering all this does not necessarily help when
you're freshly broken up, though, and knowledge isn't
a vaccine against heartbreak. Even people who know all
this still wind up eating and drinking copious amounts
of things that come in pints, and they still belt out poorly
considered, semi-intoxicated karaoke covers of Alanis
Morissette songs. (Neither here nor there, but I may no
longer be welcome at a certain Applebee's.)
But maybe it helps put breakups in context. A break-
up, at its best, can be an act of selflessness, courage or
emotional liberation. And almost every breakup shapes
our relationship with love -what it means to us, why it
matters to us and why we're willing to fight for it.
It's not the most fun way to go about doing that (it's
probably among the suckier ways, in fact), but it's good
for us, even if it doesn't feel like it.

Student Alliance Party lacks
qualified candidates
Let's talk about the experience
of the Student Alliance Party execu-
tive ticket.
Its presidential candidate's ex-
tent of experience is being a student
senator who was recommended
for disqualification by the Election
Commission. While I applaud ef-
fort, there is a rather substantial
learning curve from student sena-
tor to Student Body president. It
seems far fetched that the Student
Alliance Party has realized this.
Its vice presidential candidate
has no experience whatsoever at
UF other than being a student -agraduate student. And he wants to
manage the cabinet?
The party's treasurer candidate
is probably the most questionable
of them all. His previous experi-
ence: assistant chief of staff, where
he accomplished nothing. Zero.
Zip. Sounds great! Let's sign him
up to manage a $14.4 million bud-
get. Is this what Student Govern-
ment elections are coming to?
To the Student Alliance Party:
Next time, please have enough re-
spect for the Student Body to pro-
vide us with decent choices for the
executive ticket. Until then, run for
Student Senate, Mr. Dream-big-
and-not-live-in-reality.

Guest column
America's drinking problem serves as way to escape reality
very foreign tourist who comes to America must thinkwe are walking advertisements for the latest low-calo-
rie Budweiser. America has a drinking problem and a
culture that once scoffed at the idea of moderation.
Perhaps it was during Prohibition in the 1920s -when ev-
ery drink was precious -that this nation adopted the principle
of savoring every drop, so long as you can finish your drink in
a minute or less.
Regardless, it was clear from the beginning that you were
either a drinker or soon to be one. If you don't drink, it's best
not to say so because you are bound to be ostracized. How do
you explain to someone that you don't like numbing all the cir-
cuits in your brain? And it's not as if you can escape alcohol's
tempting hand. From football games and camping to movie
theaters and your little sister's boring school recital, there really
is no setting that isn't conducive with drinking.Eric Tegethoff It starts on the most sacred of days
Speaking Out too. One birthday, you're eating cake
and hitting pifnatas. By the time you
turn 21, you're taking shots and knock-
ing over that jackass who told you to slow down on the sauce.
And yet, no one seems to understand why that is. It's just
assumed that social events require lubrication in the form of
alcohol. It becomes ingrained in us as Americans from the time
we are born that getting drunk will lead to a good time.
Maybe it does sometimes. It all appears to be an escape from
a reality we'd rather not accept. Instead of evaluating where we
stand, we'd rather get drunk and forget our problems.
We're kept like fish in a barrel, doomed to swim a circle in
the same stagnant water. Funny thing is, most of us don't even
need a new barrel, just cleaner water. Life can be more enjoy-
able with the simple recognition and acceptance of truths aboutourselves. There is no need to hide those truths behind a bottle.
In fact, that bottle contains the world's oldest truth serum so
you might as well deal with reality on your own terms.
Or maybe the problem is bigger than that. Maybe the prob-
lem starts because of the way we treat alcohol. From the time
we first see beer, it is clear to us that beer has one purpose: get-
ting you drunk. There seems to be no other redeeming quality.
It tastes bad, leads you to make poor decisions and the next
morning you feel like a horse on the way to the glue factory.
So, in an act of ultimate self-hypocrisy, you could've found
me at Gasparilla this past weekend. This pirate-themed parade
is the largest collection of drunkards east of New Orleans' Mar-
di Gras. But I never claimed to be a saint, and I have no shame
telling you I know this column is done because I just finished
my last beer.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Unite, Student Alliance parties to wrap up slating
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Slating interviews for Student
Senate positions with the Unite
Party and the Student Alliance
party will come to an end Tues-
day at 5 p.m.
The Unite Party interviewed
45 students, and the Student Al-
liance Party interviewed 61 stu-
dents.
Fifty Senate seats are avail-
able.Nick Mildebrath, campaign
manager for the Student Alli-
ance party, said his party has in-
terviewed enthusiastic students
with new ideas for Student Gov-
ernment.
He said he is excited so many
potential candidates have come
by to slate.
"It doesn't matter how great
your platform is if you don't
have anybody good running on
it," Mildebrath said.
Unite Party spokesman BenMeyers said the Unite Party in-
terviewed more students on
Monday than it
did on Friday.
Meyers said
he is impressed
with the leader-
ship experience
of the students
who have been
Mildebrath interviewed.
He said the Unite Party has a
lot of great potential candidates.
"We're looking for diversity,"Meyers said. "We're looking for a
great set of viewpoints that rep-
resent campus as a whole."
UF freshman Dara Schopp,
who slated with the Unite Party,
said she wants to become more
involved with the Unite Party
because it has done so much pro-
gressive work on campus.
"I just like being a part of
something that stands for posi-
tive change," Schopp said.
Michael Crowley, a UF aero-
space engineering senior, choseto slate with the Student Alliance
party because he wants to bring
UF's College of Engineering more
recognition from SG.
"I feel like the Student Alli-
ance really is a party that has
the students' interests at heart,"
Crowley said.
Supervisor of Elections Ariana
Alfonso said that the Action Par-
ty and the Valence Party are also
registered for the spring election
but did not conduct interviews.
Support group helps students with sick, dead loved ones
0 THE GROUP MEETS THURSDAYS.
By KAREN SULLIVAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Loreal Dolar was about to enter her first
year of college when life took a drastic turn.
She was on vacation with her family inHawaii when her mother died in a snorkel-
ing accident. She didn't know where to turn.
Dolar found a way to cope with her loss:
forming Gator Students of Ailing Mothers
and Fathers.
"I know I'm not the only person going
through this," she said.
The UF chapter of the National Students
of AMF Support Network helps studentsgrieving the illness or loss of a loved one. The
group's first meeting is Thursday in the Reitz
Union, Rooms 278 and 279 at 7:30 p.m.
The chapter will have peer-
On led, open-discussion groups.CampuS Lauren Levy, the support
group coordinator for the chap-
ter, met Dolar at a grief support group in the
fall of 2009 after losing her father to cancerin May.
"I want this peer-to-peer group to be a
place where students can feel free to be vul-
nerable and say, 'Let's not have an agenda
this week. This is what's on my heart, and
what I'm wrestling with. What do you all
think? ' Levy said.
For information, students can visit "Gator
Students of AMF" on Facebook.

Gators open practice with questions behind the plate
Alligator File Photo
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan's team started practice Friday with holes still in the lineup. O'Sullivan has a
variety of options he could use because of the Gators' depth.By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achia ng@alligator org
It wasn't hard for the Gators to
exceed expectations last season.
But this year, it will be just as easy
for No. 7 Florida to disappoint.
Unlike last season, when the
Gators were picked to finish 11th in
the Southeastern Conference, many
expect them to win the SEC East in
2010.
UF's depth will play a big role
in turning that prediction into real-
ity. It brings back a sophomore class
that impressed in its first season
along with the top class of freshmen
in the nation.
In the team's first practice of
the season Friday, UF coach Kevin
O'Sullivan noticed his options.
"There is certainly more depth,"
he said. "We have a lot of guys bat-
tling for spots."
One that will be up for grabs un-
til the season begins is the catcher
position.
Highly touted freshmen Aus-
tin Maddox and Mike Zunino join
sophomore Ben McMahan in therace to see who will be the backstop
when the season starts.
"Our depth behind the plate is as
good as probably anybody's proba-
bly in the country," O'Sullivan said.
In order to get as many of
them into the lineup as possible,
O'Sullivan is looking into moving
first baseman Preston Tucker to the
outfield for some games.
"He played a little bit of outfield
in high school," he
said. "If we were to
do that, we would
probably put him
Baseball in right so he stayson the same side of
the field. If we were
to be able to put him in the outfield,
that gives us one extra bat we can
put in the lineup."
That will leave first base open for
the 6-foot-3 Maddox, who received
some playing time at the spot in Fri-
day's scrimmage.
Another area UF addressed over
the offseason was pitching.
They added five pitchers, includ-
ing big lefty Brian Johnson, who em-
bodies O'Sullivan's love for versatil-

UF MEN'S GOLF
UF ends Day I tied for fifth
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
After two rounds of competition at
the Arizona Invitational, the Florida
men's golf team is currently in a three-
way tie for fifth place.
The Gators ended Monday's 36 holes
shooting a total of 560 (281-279, -8) in
Tucson, Ariz., trailing current leader
California by 17 strokes.
UF's struggles might be due to some
rust, as the tournament was the team's
first competition of the spring schedule
and the first since its second-place finish
in the Isleworth Invitational on Oct. 27.
Although the Gators hadn't compet-
ed in over three months, UF coach Bud-
dy Alexander expected more from his
team, especially as good as the weather
conditions were Monday.
"We didn't play particularly well
today in that this golf course is really
different," Alexander said in a press re-
lease. "The wind wasn't blowing, so it
was a pretty easy day to score, but we
didn't adjust. I don't think we realized
how easy the course was, and the team
needed to pick up on that as the daywent on but didn't."
Senior Tyson Alexander (70-69, -3)
finished both of his rounds on a posi-
tive note. He birdied two of his final
three holes in the first round and sunk
an eagle on the 18th hole in the second
round.
Junior Bank Vongvanij (71-68) tied
Alexander and six other golfers for 10th
place at -3.
One of those other golfers was fresh-
man Tommy Mou.
Mou (69-70, -3), competing as an in-
dividual, carded one eagle, eight bird-
ies and seven bogeys in his collegiate
debut.
One shot behind was senior Tim
McKenney (68-72) who tied for 18th
place at -2. Junior Andres Echavarria
(72-70) tied for 30th at even par.
Rounding out Florida's lineup in 71st
place was freshman Tyler McCumber,
who finished with a total score of 158
(77-81, +16).
Monday was an up-and-down day
for McCumber, with more of the latter
than the former.
SEE GOLF, PAGE 162010 class is Meyer's best yet
n Wednesday, we may all bewitnesses to a miracle.
The Big Three of recruiting
gurus -ESPN, Rivals.com and Scout.
com -are on the verge of agreeing
on which school has the nation's top
class.
Since 2006, when ESPN joined the
game, the three have never come to the
same conclusion, but with just a day to
go until National Signing Day, Florida
is a unanimous No. 1.
In a business so heavily based on
often-arbitrary opinions, and where
analysts can garner attention simply
by being different, this is quite the ac-
complishment.
And it's a miracle in more ways
than one.
If it holds, and these players resist
their natural inclination to create dra-
ma, it'll be the most impressive recruit-
ing job of Urban Meyer's career.
And it puts the Gators back where
they were before that beatdown loss to
Alabama -on top.I dh I A few months

Then, UF lost, Meyer started buggin'

The Man to one of the most scrutinized
NFL Draft prospects ever.
The Gators fell out of the spotlight
by losing to the Tide, and questions
about Meyer's future made an easy tar-
get for opposing coaches to use on the
recruiting trail.
This is a crucial time for the pro-
gram, and in the face of it, Florida has
amassed another stacked recruiting

fly and depth.
"When we first got here, our goal was to deepen the
pitching staff. That's not done overnight," he said. "It takes
more than one recruiting class, but we feel good about
where we are at right now."
Johnson not only pitches but can hit as well. When he
isn't on the mound, he is an option to play either first base
or the outfield.
For center fielder Matt den Dekker, it is hard to imagine
that this season's group of freshmen could top the year thenow-sophomores put together, which included Tucker's
historic season.
"It's crazy. We had a lot of freshmen last year that
stepped up and played well with Tucker and some of the
pitchers," den Dekker said. "Looking at this year, we have
some players that are going to jump in right away and get
some playing lime and probably making an impact."
O'Sullivan expects to tweak his lineup multiple times
before finding the right one.
"We are going to toy with our lineup an awful lot for the
first three or four weeks before we have conference play,"
he said. "We'll try a lot of different stuff because we are able
to do that."Team resumes play today
GOLF, from page 15
Although McCumber was the only Gator to tally
two eagles on the day, he also took eight strokes on
a par 3 in the first round.
Before Monday, McCumber led the team with a
stroke average of 71.6.
"Overall, we'll need to turn it up a notch or
two and hopefully get a good round to fin-
ish this tournament up."
Buddy Alexander
UF men's golf coach
Entering the Arizona Invitational, the Gators
were ranked the third-best team in the country by
Golfweek, their highest ranking of the season.
"I think that everyone was pretty average today,"
Alexander said. "Overall, we'll need to turn it up a
notch or two and hopefully get a good round to fin-
ish this tournament up."
The Arizona Invitational will conclude with its

class and pulled in kids from all over the
country.
And it looks like Meyer is fostering the
same kind of atmosphere Pete Carroll had
while he was at USC, where highly rated
players sign regardless of how many other
big-time guys have committed to play thesame position.
By Rivals.com's rankings, Florida has
commitments from the Nos. 1, 7 and 19
weakside defensive ends, the Nos. 1, 2 and
11 defensive tackles, the Nos. 3, 4, and 11
cornerbacks and the Nos. 2 and 12 safeties
in its class.
Of course, recruiting rankings are far
from an exact science, and star levels don'ttranslate into wins, but this certainly can't
be seen as a bad thing.
Even with a somewhat shaky situation
surrounding Meyer's future, the Gators
have remained the dominant force when
dealing with recruits.
When Lauderdale Lakes Anderson
High four-star safety Demar Dorsey start-
ed having second thoughts about his com-mitment to UF, the Gators kicked him to
the curb.
Things could easily have taken a turn
for the worse during this recruiting sea-
son, but as of now, Florida has pulled off
a big win.
If this class stays intact, it'll offer some-
thing that seemed impossible a little more
than a month ago: stability.Catching Options S-oo:mb 1neshman
