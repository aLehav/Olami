“Oh, and by the way, one more thing. Let’s do it again — I’m coming back,” says UF quarterback Tim Tebow on the 
stage at the end of the celebration at The Swamp in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Sunday afternoon.
SUPERMAN RETURNS

Tim Tebow has never been one to disappoint UF fans, so 
why start now?
The quarterback gave those in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium 
for the Gators’ national championship celebration the news 
they had shown up hoping to hear: He will return to play his 
senior season instead of entering the NFL Draft.
Tebow was brought on stage by former UF signal callers 
Danny Wuerffel and Chris Leak for winning the Offensive 
MVP award in the BCS Championship, and Wuerffel whipped 
the crowd of 42,000 into a frenzy by pointing out that Tebow 
still hadn’t won a title as a senior like he and Leak had.
But amid chants of “One more year!” from the stands, 
Tebow turned to walk offstage after thanking his teammates, 
coach Urban Meyer and The Gator Nation for their support.
Before he reached the edge, he turned around and deliv -
ered the line UF fans had waited all afternoon for.
“Oh, and by the way, one more thing,” Tebow said. “Let’s 
do it again — I’m coming back.”
Just like that, a celebration of UF’s 2008 title — complete 
with the return of several former players and the unveiling 
of signs commemorating the season in the south end zone ― 
morphed into an early party for the 2009 championship the Tebow delays jump to 
NFL to stay for 4th year

It turns out students who skipped 
class on Friday after celebrating the 
football team’s defeat of the Oklahoma 
Sooners the night before weren’t alone.
Administrators took the day off too.
A survey of UF’s top administrators 
beginning at 9 a.m. Friday revealed that 
many of them were away.
UF Provost Joe Glover, who sent a 
memo to administrators in December 
asking them to remind faculty and 
staff not to cancel classes because of 
the game, left for Miami Tuesday after -noon and was out the rest of the week, 
according to his office.
“I combined attendance at the 
game with a visit 
to a friend I haven’t 
seen in a decade,” he 
wrote in an e-mail.
“I will also point 
out that even though 
I was traveling and 
technically on leave 
I continued to deal 
with e-mails, phone 
calls and other university business,” he 
wrote.

UF admissions can expect to snag some 
more applicants in the coming year, if past 
championships are any indication. 
The university has received a marginal 
increase in student applications follow -
ing past national championships, said UF 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes.  
“Overall, you get a little bit more inter -
est,” Sikes said. “It’s hard to tell what is hav -
ing an impact at the moment because we’ve 
had several national championships in a 
row.“
When it comes to fluctuations in UF’s applicant pool, Sikes said there are many 
other factors at play, citing causes such as 
the current economy and the pull of in-state 
tuition.     
There was a slight increase during the 
fall admissions period following the 1996 
championship season compared to the prior 
year — an increase of 597 
applications, according to 
records from UF’s Office 
of Institutional Planning 
and Research. 
Following the football and basketball 
championships in 2006, 4,872 more applica -
tions were received in 2007 compared to the 
previous fall term, according to the records.  
However, given looming budget cuts and 
UF’s current plan to reduce enrollment by 
1,000 students each year for the next four Wins spike applicant pool

Authorities search for heavyset ninja
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — A ninja is lurking in the shad -
ows of Palm Beach County, but apparently he's more like Chris Farley 
in "Beverly Hills Ninja" than Liam Neeson in "Batman Begins."
The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office says a heavyset man with 
a visible potbelly unsuccessfully tried to steal two different ATMs 
over the past two weeks. Security video from the ATMs showed the 
unidentified man dressed in a black ninja outfit with a hood that 
showed only his eyes.
Authorities say the first attempt was made at a bank on Dec. 
29, and another attempt was made at a Walgreens on Tuesday. 
Authorities did not say how the man tried to steal the machines.

ON CAMPUS
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Three days after the Gators’ victory over the 
Oklahoma Sooners in Miami, the party was still 
on back home.
More than 40,000 Gator fans gathered in Ben 
Hill Griffin Stadium Sunday to celebrate the UF 
football team’s third national championship.
Fans of all ages came dressed in orange and 
blue to show their Gator pride.
Before the event, fans clapped and cheered 
as they watched replays of Thursday night’s 
game.
When the team rushed the field, fans jumped 
to their feet and roared.
“This team will go down as one of the great -
est football teams in history ,” UF coach Urban 
Meyer said at the start of the afternoon’s cel -
ebration. 
Later, Meyer called the team’s senior players 
to the stage for recognition.
Former UF quarterbacks Danny Wuerffel 
and Chris Leak then carried the national cham -
pionship trophy onto the field, handing the crys -
tal football to Tim Tebow while the “Superman” 
theme song played in the background.
Elizabeth Navarro, a UF sophomore who 
attended the game, said the crowd, though smaller than Miami’s, was just as excited. The 
fans broke into chants of “one more year” when 
star players Tebow and Percy Harvin took the 
stage. 
When Tebow announced he will be leading 
the Gators next season, the roar of the crowd be -
came deafening. 
At the end of the rally the team made its way 
to the north end zone to join in singing UF’s 
alma mater.  
Fans poured out of The Swamp in an orange-
and-blue stream as they made their way down 
University Avenue.
Daniel Hornick, a UF accounting junior who 
was here for the last football national champion -
ship, remembers the enthusiasm of the fans two 
years ago and was not disappointed by their re -
actions this year. 
“I was here to see the fans in 2006, and I ex -
pected nothing less from these fans,” he said.Celebration honors team
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Senate 
Democratic leaders, briefed Sunday 
by President-elect Barack Obama’s 
economic adviser, said a vote is likely 
as early as this week on providing a 
second $350 billion in bailout money 
for the financial industry.
The Bush administration and the 
incoming Obama team have under -
taken a tag-team effort to obtain the 
money from reluctant lawmakers, to 
have it waiting for Obama when he’s 
sworn in Jan. 20.
President George W. Bush would 
request the additional money for 
the Troubled Asset Relief Program, 
or TARP , but the incoming admin -
istration would allocate it. Obama’s 
economic adviser, Larry Summers, 
briefed lawmakers Sunday on the 
bailout and on the incoming adminis -
tration’s plan for roughly $800 billion 
in spending and tax breaks to spur the 
economy.Senate Banking Committee 
Chairman Christopher Dodd, 
D-Conn., said Sunday that lawmak -
ers were assured there would be fuller 
accounting of the money spent on the 
bailout. Banks and other financial in -
stitutions have received billions from 
the government with few rules, and 
most won’t say where 
the money has gone.
Obama, in a 
taped interview aired 
Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” prom -
ised to see that more money goes 
directly to distressed homeowners. 
“When you look at how we have han -
dled the home foreclosure situation 
and whether we’ve done enough in 
terms of helping families ... we haven’t 
done enough,” he said.
“Larry Summers made a very 
strong argument for why it’s impor -
tant and critical for the overall recov -
ery,” said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
“And I think that’s an argument that 
most senators understand.”Vote on bailout likely
“This team will go down as one 
of the greatest football teams in       
history.”

win, she said.
“The amount of students who say

It wasn’t until Friday morning when 
she was celebrating with her friends on 
University Avenue that Carolyn Martin re -
alized she would be giving the first campus 
tour after the championship.
“I’m like, ‘Guys, I gotta be outta here 
soon ‘cause I have a tour bright and early 
in the morning,’” Martin said.
And even though you might think the first tour after a national championship 
would be the easiest one of the year, the po -
litical science senior said she was nervous 
that students would ask more questions 
about football than academics.
She said she got questions like, “Do you 
see the football players? Do you have any 
of their signatures? Do you know anyone 
that dates them? Are they cute?”
She even got a few questions about how 
to get on the football team, she said.
“Ok well, you know, I’ll give you the number for the UAA and you can talk to 
them about that,” she said she told the stu -
dents.
Jeff Edwards, a senior at St. Lucie West 
Centennial High School, who watched the 
entire game and woke up at 4 a.m. to get 
to UF on time for the  9 a.m. tour, said the 
championship would not affect his choice 
of college too much.
“If they had lost last night, I wouldn’t 
have been like, nope, not coming to 
Florida,” he said. “But it doesn’t hurt.”Post-BCS tours not all about sports 
ed the game and took a vacation day Friday, 
said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.  
Machen declined to comment on the 
reason for his absence in an e-mail.
Other administrators who attended 
the game and were out Friday include 
Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia 
Telles-Irvin, who left for Miami Tuesday 
afternoon, according to her office, and 
Vice President of University Relations Jane 
Adams, according to Sikes.
Administrators who came in late or 
worked a full day Friday include Chief 
Financial Officer Matt Fajack, who wrote 
in an e-mail that he took the morning off 
but worked the afternoon. According to 
his office, he attended the game. Senior 
Vice President for Administration Kyle Cavanaugh and UF’s Senior Vice President 
for Health Affairs Doug Barrett worked a 
full day and did not attend the game, ac -
cording to their office. Interim Dean of 
Students Paige Crandall said she worked 
a full day and 
watched the game 
with students at 
the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center.
Although many administrators were 
in Miami for the game, Sikes wrote in an 
e-mail that they were still at work. Many 
of them met with alumni and other poten -
tial donors, which “is even more important 
now during our current economic crisis as 
state funds dwindle,” she wrote.
She also wrote that UF was expected to 
send a delegation of officials to participate 
in BCS National Championship events.As for UF’s policy toward student atten -
dance on Friday, she said in an interview 
that UF ultimately left it up to faculty. 
“The University of Florida itself does 
not enforce what happens in each and ev -
ery classroom,” she said.
Some students expressed disappoint -
ment that UF would encourage faculty not 
to cancel classes Friday while many top ad -
ministrators took the day off.
“It’s very hypocritical,” said Gaurav 
Saxena, a UF business administration se -
nior who attended the game. “If the faculty 
and the administration are going to say one 
thing, then they should live up to it also.”
Joel Birlingmayer, a UF chemical engi -
neering freshman, disagreed.
“If they have vacation days, they can use 
them during the game,” he said. “That’s 
probably when I would use them.”Some administrators didn’t skip work for game

The Gators took home the championship, Superman will 
return to Gainesville and the Alligator Editorial Board 
rocked “I heart Bernie” T-shirts at work Sunday night.
Well, not exactly.
As we gleefully marched to class Friday morning — some 
of us a little more greasy than others — we couldn’t help but 
think, if just for a second, that maybe, just maybe, Bernie was 
right.
Whoa, did we really just write that?
Apparently, we had forgotten the wonderful afterglow that 
spreads itself around a college campus in the wake of winning 
a national championship: Hangovers mysteriously disap -
peared, less-than-riveting courses suddenly held our attention 
and even the most irascible of professors managed to crack a 
smile for once.  
Maybe having to drag our butts to class the day after the 
big game wasn’t such as a terrible ordeal after all.
If, for a glorious moment, the former misgivings of our 
typically humdrum existence gave way to a Utopian paradise. 
Until, that is, we discovered that a certain key demographic 
of campus happened to disregard its academic obligations to 
The Gator Nation.
Nothing like throwing caution into the wind, Bernie.
The Editorial Board will save you the trouble of having to 
scour over an ever-growing laundry list of culprits who bailed 
on work Friday, but let’s just say UF heavyweights such as 
Machen and Provost Joe Glover came to the conclusion that 
they were too cool for school.
We can only imagine these two tough guys attempting 
to don an outfit akin to their schoolboy mischief: skinny leg 
jeans, a white T-shirt and leather jacket. Wannabe rebels with -
out a cause — hoping to conjure imagery of Arthur Fonzarelli 
(who?) as they took the mean streets of South Beach by storm.
Thank goodness for photo sharing! The Editorial Board 
rests assured it won’t be long before someone stumbles upon 
Glover’s Flickr account and finds the infamous photo album.
Hey Bernie, Senior Vice President for Administration Kyle 
Cavanaugh made it to work on time, not to mention, along 
with a few other stalwarts. No doubt they did a double-take at 
their alarms come 6 a.m. and probably mainlined a couple of 
Red Bulls, but hey, there’s a university to run.
Cavanaugh and Crandall deserve a hearty pat on the back 
for their actions — unless they simply missed the memo where 
UF brass were urged to stress the necessity for students to at -
tend class, while secretly administrators took a “vacation day” 
on Friday.
Somebody better call Vogue; apparently “flip-flopping” is 
this season’s new black.
The Editorial Board can’t blame Machen, Glover and pals 
for their desire to stick around Miami for an extra day or two. 
Taking a quick dip in Lake Wauburg tends to lose a little some -
thing when your constantly peering over your shoulder for 
real life Alberts and Albertas. And something tells us that a 
slice or two at Satchel’s Pizza isn’t exactly like feasting on the 
salt-roasted porterhouse at Table 8.
It’s far too early in the semester for the administration and 
student body to nearly come to fisticuffs, so let the Editorial 
Board offer a championship manifesto of sorts to remedy the 
situation.
Simply put, if we have to attend class the day after a cham -
pionship game, then the administration should be present on 
campus as well. If “Team Machen” wants to take a breather 
after UF reaffirms its standing atop the sports world, great.  
They just better expect to find the student body to follow suit.
And who said Rome wasn’t built in a day?What do you call 2,000 Americans at the bottom 
of the Atlantic Ocean? A good start.
A sobering joke in any situation, but partic -
ularly nerve-racking when an Irishman uses it to strike 
up a conversation with you while both of you are stand -
ing in a graveyard in a tiny town in the south of Ireland 
on New Year’s Day.
Despite the inauspicious start, the conversation 
was a friendly one. After a few minutes of banter, the 
man brought up the election of President-elect Barack 
Obama.
“You guys finally got it right, huh?” he asked. When 
an Irishman is willing to compliment the United States, 
however backhandedly, you know that something spe -
cial has happened.
There are strong temptations for America to turn in -
ward rather than use newfound political capital abroad to 
make progress on global crises. Already, President-elect 
Obama has signaled that his focus in his first term will be 
on domestic issues. Given the state of our economy, one 
can hardly blame him. But for our purposes and for the 
good of our world, the incoming president has an obliga -
tion to be engaged in global matters.
To his credit, President Bush understood this in the 
last months of his presidency and has cooperated with 
Europe and Asia to coordinate fiscal and monetary pol -
icy that will soothe investors and return a measure of fi -
nancial sanity to global markets.
It is incumbent upon President-elect Obama to con -
tinue such efforts. Moreover, it is important that the 
president uses his honeymoon period abroad to help 
jump-start global trade talks that have been languish -
ing for years. Although no trade agreement is perfect, and individuals everywhere are 
particularly likely to be hesitant 
to lower trade barriers in a time 
of economic hardship, there is no 
doubt that the opening of interna -
tional markets has on the whole 
led to greater American and international prosperity. 
But even beyond our own interests, the United States 
must reclaim its humanitarian leadership in the interna -
tional community. With thousands fleeing for their lives 
in Darfur, America has done precious little to push for 
real international aid besides making noise about geno -
cide. With hundreds of civilians dying in the Israeli oper -
ation in Gaza, the United States has been conspicuously 
absent in calling for measures to bring humanitarian re -
lief to the innocents caught in the crossfire.
America, once a beacon of hope for those in need 
across the world, has been caught napping one too many 
times over the past several years.
During his campaign, President-elect Obama gave a 
speech in Berlin in which he acknowledged being a citi -
zen of the world. If he governs true to his words, Obama 
will recognize that world citizenship carries an obliga -
tion to stay involved, and he will help those who cannot 
help themselves. 
Despite all the problems at home, reasserting an 
American presence abroad is an economic and humani -
tarian imperative that the new administration must not 
ignore. Neglecting to heed these responsibilities will not 
only continue to weaken America’s economic and politi -
cal standing abroad, but it will also bring some choice 
words from at least one Irishman.

pies waving a banner comparing Gaza to the 
Warsaw ghetto of Nazi-occupied Poland. 
Seriously?
It is sad to see the Gaza conflict spread to 
the UF campus. It is even sadder to see bla -
tant ignorance on both sides, ranging from 
Facebook statuses and casual conversations 
at the Hub to erroneous street demonstra -
tions. 
Wherever I go, it pains me to see not ac -
tual hatred but lack of understanding.
As an Israeli, I’ve had to reluctantly argue 
my way through the past two weeks, mostly 
in vain. The great intellectual community of 
Titletown is deader than Vanilla Ice’s rap -
ping career. 
I was inclined to write a letter consisting 
of facts, history and analysis of the situation 
in Israel, but it is obvious that these entreat -
ies of reason will most likely fall on already-
decided deaf ears. 
So, my dear Gainesville pseudo-intellec -
tuals, next time you think it is “hip” to talk 
about Palestinian suffering at a house party or debate the merits of Soviet-era commu -
nism, do us all a favor and don’t. 
Instead, do yourself one by actually read -
ing beyond TV headlines and body counts. 
Did you know there’s an ongoing civil 
war in Sri Lanka? What about Asian human 
trafficking? And who here still remembers 
Darfur?
The founders of this country, ironically, 
lost their lives so we could have freedom of 
information. I hope everyone takes a step 
back and realizes that knowledge and un -
derstanding, not blame, are the key.

Gators earned BCS title
As a University of Georgia graduate and 
devoted Bulldog fan, you may find it hard to 
believe that I was actually rooting for Florida 
to win the BCS football national champion -
ship.  
I hold no ill will against the University of 
Oklahoma or any other team for that mat -
ter. I am a Bulldog fan first and an SEC fan second.
Congratulations, University of Florida! 
Your championship is well deserved. All 
SEC fans were Florida Gators fans on Jan. 8, 
2009!

BCS conferences need realignment
It has recently come to my attention that 
there are some in the media who do not be -
lieve Florida should be crowned the BCS 
National Champion. 
Some say Utah is more deserving, while 
others mention USC. I would like to point 
out that in the Sagarin ratings in USA Today, 
Florida ranked No. 4 in strength of schedule, 
while Utah came in at a dismal No. 56. 
Utah had a chance to equalize its low 
conference schedule by adding top noncon -
ference opponents.  
However, Michigan, Utah State, Oregon 
State and Weber State were all unranked at 
kickoff. Utah beat six bowl teams — only 
three ranked. Florida beat 10 bowl teams, six of them ranked.  
As for USC, I find it to be hypocritical for 
complaining when it is its own conference, 
the Pacific-10, that has been one of the big -
gest hinderances toward establishing a play -
off system. 
The Pac-10 and the Big Ten have insisted 
on preserving the BCS in order to protect 
their financially secured investments in the 
Rose Bowl.  
Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen has 
even threatened to leave the BCS should a 
plus-1 system be implemented.  
Therefore, I call for a conference realign -
ment. The Pac-10 should add Boise State and 
Utah, split into two divisions and establish a 
conference championship.
The Big 10 should follow suit by adding 
Notre Dame and splitting into two divi -
sions.  
Unfortunately, the Pac-10 and the Big 10 
have no interest in making financial sacrific -
es in order to advance the game. The situa -
tion may need the arbitration of a third party 
— President-elect Obama, take note.

So UF just slapped the sign up 
above the rest, where it blocks the 
first few rows of the upper deck, 
and a reorganization is no doubt in 
the works.
But when quarterback Tim 
Tebow announced he would return 
for his senior season shortly after 
the sign was unveiled, he might as 
well have said, “Save a place for 
the 2009 banners, too.”
The Gators will return most of 
their playmakers from a squad that 
finished the year ranked fourth in 
the nation in scoring offense and 
defense this season. 
The entire secondary, plus in -
jured safety Dorian Munroe, will 
be back to lead a defense that tied 
for the most interceptions in col -

The defensive line will re -

The UF frontcourt has been questioned all season.
Saturday, it couldn’t find an answer.
Despite being outrebounded by 24, UF (14-2, 1-0 
Southeastern Conference) held on to beat Mississippi 78-
68 on the opening night of SEC play.
“It hurts me a lot,” forward Dan Werner said. “I know 
we can rebound, but for some reason we just couldn’t do 
it.”
The Rebels (9-6, 0-1 SEC) came into the game as the 
conference’s worst rebounding team and were the only 
school to have a negative rebounding margin. 
“I don’t know how competitive we are,” UF coach 
Billy Donovan said. 
“It was like the possession didn’t start until they shot 
the ball.”
The Gators finished the game with only four offensive 
boards. 
UF started fast, shooting 62 percent from the field in 
the first half and taking a 14-point lead into halftime.
But the well dried up in the second, and UF allowed 
Mississippi to play their way back into the game.
The Gators shot only 32 percent in the second half, and 
with just over two minutes to play, their lead had fallen 
to 6 points.
“I thought we got open shots, but we just weren’t 
knocking them down,” guard Nick Calathes said. “I think 
that we should have probably gone inside more.”
Calathes led UF in points (19) and rebounds (seven).
“It’s always a concern for me when our leading re -
bounder is our point guard,” Donovan said.

n BOSTON COLLEGE MAY WANT 
STEVE ADDAZIO AS ITS COACH.
By EVAN DREXLER
Alligator Staff Writer
edrexler@alligator.org
After celebrating his second national 
championship in three years in a ceremony 
Sunday afternoon, UF coach Urban Meyer 
announced he will be losing a member of 
his staff and could be in danger of losing 
another.
Tight ends coach John Hevesy is joining 
Dan Mullen’s staff at Mississippi State as 
quarterbacks coach.
“He’s been promoted and he’s going 
to have a title at Mississippi State,” Meyer 
said. “We’ve been together eight years. He’s a great coach, great friend, great per -
son, great father, great husband.”
Hevesy spent time as UF’s offensive line 
coach and was with Meyer in Utah and at 
Bowling Green, also coaching offensive 
linemen and tight ends.
Reports also have 
new offensive coordina -
tor Steve Addazio being 
chased by Boston College 
for the Eagles’ head coach -
ing vacancy. 
“Boston College, I think 
they might request permission to talk to 
Steve,” Meyer said. “I don’t know much 
more than that.”
Addazio, who was named Mullen’s 
replacement as offensive coordinator on 
Dec. 27, was not at Sunday’s celebration 
because he was in the hospital with a knee infection.
Addazio had already interviewed to be -
come the head coach at Syracuse and Yale 
as those positions became open.
“Obviously, Steve’s a great coach,” 
Meyer said. 
“(Boston College) should ask for per -
mission to talk to him.”
Also absent from the event was redshirt 
senior tight end Cornelius Ingram and ju -
nior linebacker Brandon Spikes. 
Redshirt freshman running back Chris 
Rainey hobbled onto the field wearing a 
protective boot on his right foot. Meyer 
said Rainey has an ankle sprain and that 
his injury is not serious.
On stage at the celebration, Meyer — 
like everyone else who spoke — praised 
his team’s efforts this season and said how 
proud he was of their accomplishment.TE coach follows Mullen to Mississippi St.

UF GYMNASTICS
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
There wasn’t nearly as much on 
the line in Friday’s gymnastics meet 
against Oklahoma as there was in 
the football team’s contest against 
the same school, but the end result 
proved to be no different.
UF wins.
The Gators beat the Sooners for 
the second night in a row — dif -
ferent sport, different venue, but in 
similar fashion.
The Gators won comfortably 
196.5-195.075. It was the fourth-highest season-opening score in 
school history.
On a night when four freshmen 
— a third of the team — debuted in 
their first college meet, inexperience 
hardly seemed to matter.
“It was amazing,” said freshman 
Amy Ferguson, who scored a 9.75 
on her floor exercise. 
“Words can’t even describe the 
feeling I had. I had so much adrena -
line, it was awesome.”
The team admitted it was fueled 
by the BCS National Championship 
Game win Thursday night.
“Of course you’re going to feed off of it,” said junior Melanie Sinclair. 
“You come in with a positive atti -
tude, thinking that (the Sooners are) 
a little bit doubtful 
because they’ve 
lost something al -
ready , so you feed 
off of it.”
Sinclair, an 
All-American, 
won the first 
two events of the 
meet: the vault 
and uneven bars. She added an all-
around title with a score of 39.425.
The other heavy hitters on the team, Corey Hartung, Amanda 
Castillo and Maranda Smith, also 
contributed heavily to the outcome.
Hartung and Smith turned in 
9.9s on floor, cementing a Gators 
win. Castillo turned in another 9.9 
for UF on balance beam.
“We had some high and we had 
some lows, but it’s the first meet of 
the season, and I think we did really 
well,” Castillo said.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn thought 
the start was a solid performance 
that the team would  use as a build -
ing block.
“It’s always a big question mark, the first meet of the year,” Faehn 
said. 
“We have so many new faces. It’s 
a very young team. It’s really differ -
ent from what we had in the past 
with so many freshmen. All in all, I 
think it’s a great start.”
Sinclair said that despite the win, 
there are always things to work on.
“The small details: handstands, 
legs, pointed toes, landings, presen -
tations, smiling when you land,” 
Sinclair said. “All the little tenths 
that adds up, those are what’s im -
portant.”Freshmen prove themselves in season-opening win
 UF LOST FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
NEARLY TWO MONTHS.
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
Going on the road in the Southeastern 
Conference is never easy, especially when 
it’s against the only unbeaten team in the 
league.
UF (15-2, 1-1 SEC) found that out the hard 
way in an 81-65 loss at No. 9 Auburn (17-0, 
2-0 SEC) on Sunday.
The defeat ended UF’s school-record 15-game winning streak. The team had not lost 
since Nov. 14.
The No. 18 Gators held their own against 
the Tigers for the first 28 minutes, trailing by 
just 5 with about 12 minutes remaining.
That was before Auburn capitalized on 
two UF turnovers on back-to-back posses -
sions and expanded its lead to as much as 
16.
“They just really took over the game, and 
they did it defensively,” UF coach Amanda 
Butler said.
The Gators tried to scrap and claw their 
way back late, but Auburn quelled UF’s runs 
with 3-point shots.Offensive rebounds and 3-pointers kept 
the Gators alive for much of the game before 
Auburn took control.
Sha Brooks struggled shooting the ball af -
ter scoring a career-high 31 points in her last 
game. She went just 3 of 18 from the field 
and tallied 11 points.
Auburn’s combination of DeWanna 
Bonner and Sherell Hobbs was too much for 
the Gators to handle. The pair scored 52 of 
the Tigers’ points.
Hobbs finished with 23 points, while 
Bonner tallied 29.
MOSSOR OUT FOR SEASON:  Junior guard 
Jennifer Mossor, whose right ACL was torn against Mississippi State on Thursday, is out 
for the season.
Mossor’s injury forced more minutes out 
of guards Lonnika Thompson and Susan 
Yenser.
Her absence also seemed to affect the 
Gators’ rotation and their perimeter scoring, 
but Butler was not using it as an excuse.
As for the rebounding from the loss:
“There is nothing that can sharpen your 
focus like disappointment,” Butler said. 
“And there is nothing that can make you 
more hungry for the next game than when 
you’re coming off of a loss.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.UF’s 15-game winning streak snapped by AuburnSinclair
MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 2009   ALLIGATOR , 15
Stamper, Brandon Hicks, Dustin 
Doe and A.J. Jones have already 
proven themselves capable of car -
rying the torch.
So even if Spikes departs, expect 
the 2009 UF defense to be even bet -
ter than this year’s, and the offense 
should remain explosive.
And even so, signs may be 
pointing toward Spikes return -
ing. Stamper said Sunday that 
Spikes told him after the BCS Championship Game he planned 
to stay, and Spikes has repeatedly 
said Tebow’s choice would play a 
big role.
Not surprising from the guy 
who met Tebow for the first time 
on a recruiting visit at Alabama and 
said he would sign with whichever 
school the big lefty chose.
A chunk of the line is gradu -
ating, along with receiver Louis 
Murphy and running back Kestahn 
Moore, but the hardest loss to ab -
sorb would be that of junior Percy 
Harvin.
Harvin said he was leaning to -ward staying in Gainesville in a 
television interview Sunday.
If he leaves, David Nelson, 
Riley Cooper, Deonte Thompson 
and Carl Moore would have a 
lot of work to do, but they’d get 
some help from running backs 
Emmanuel Moody, Jeff Demps 
and Chris Rainey, and coach Urban 
Meyer seems to already have his 
sights set on the next Harvin-like 
athlete.
Andre Debose, one of the na -
tion’s top high-school receiver 
prospects with a knack for carry -
ing the ball, is committed to play at UF, and he was serenaded by fans 
during the basketball team’s win 
against Mississippi on Saturday.
And look at the schedule. 
Charleston Southern, Troy and 
Florida International are auto -
matic wins, and the Gators will 
only face one difficult road game 
(at LSU), while they get rebuild -
ing Tennessee and Florida State 
squads at home.
The annual clash with Georgia 
should be made easier by the 
departure of quarterback Matt 
Stafford and running back 
Knowshon Moreno, meaning UF has a manageable road to another 
SEC title. 
A win there all but guarantees a 
spot in the national championship, 
held at the Rose Bowl, and though 
it would still take a few lucky 
breaks and a healthy squad, the 
Gators have a very realistic shot at 
a national title repeat.
There’s a dynasty brewing at 
UF, and should the Gators plaster 
more signs in The Swamp, their 
success can be traced back to two 
days: the day Tebow chose to play 
for Florida, and they day he chose 
to stay.
four steals. 
The Gators struggled to shoot the ball 
against the Rebels’ zone defense in the sec -
ond, but Donovan said he felt his team’s 
best chance to win was with its outside 
shooting.
“It’s not like we can pound the ball in -
side to anybody,” Donovan said.
Chandler Parsons echoed his coach’s 
sentiments.“We’re a shooting team,” Parsons said. 
“That’s what we do.”
With 30 seconds to go in the game, a 
frustrated Donovan walked down to the 
end of the bench and scolded the one player 
who didn’t even step on the floor against 
the Rebels.
Vernon Macklin, the 6-foot-10, 
240-pound Georgetown transfer who must 
sit out this season because of transfer rules, 
was as much to blame in Donovan’s eyes 
as anyone for the Gators’ apparent lack of 
toughness.“I said, ‘You know what part of the prob -
lem is?’” Donovan said. “‘You don’t put 
those guys on their back 
enough in practice — and 
you could, physically.’”
Donovan admits 
that while his team has 
worked hard in practice 
this season, a competitive 
element is missing.
“I’d like to see more 
physical altercations and banging (in prac -
tice),” Donovan said. “The problem is, when you have two guys in there who you’re try -
ing to create the physical altercation with, 
and neither one will physically altercate, 
it’s hard to create a physical altercation.”
UF transfer David Huertas played well 
against his old team after airballing his first 
shot 12 seconds into the contest. 
He led the Rebels in scoring with 16 
points.
Huertas was a member of UF’s 2006 na -
tional championship team but transferred 
to Mississippi after his freshman year due 
to concerns over playing time.Donovan: It’s not like we can pound the ball inside to anybodyMIKE , from page 13

Gators will be favorites to land. 
With at least 10 starters expected 
back from a defense that allowed 
fewer than 13 points per game and 
Tebow returning to run one of the 
nation’s most dynamic offenses, UF 
is likely to open the season ranked 
No. 1.
But Tebow wants more than just 
a third national title or a second 
Heisman Trophy; he’ll be chasing 
perfection, the last unchecked box 
on his college football to-do list.
“To have an undefeated season, 
that’s a goal. It’s something they’ve 
never done here at the University 
of Florida,” Tebow said, echoing his 
comments after a loss to Mississippi 
in September.
“I just love being here,” he said. 
“I love being a Gator. I feel loyal to 
this place. I’m going to stick it out 
and finish what I started here.”
Tebow cited conversations with 
NFL coaches and UF’s hiring of 
former Detroit Lions quarterbacks 
coach Scott Loeffler as big reasons 
for his return, while he added that 
his projected place in the draft had 
little impact.
But a jump start to a professional 
career was still very enticing, as he 
found sleep hard to come by while wrestling with the decision.
“He texted me (Saturday) morn -
ing and said, ‘Pray for me. I’m 
about to make some life-changing 
decisions,’” UF receiver David 
Nelson said. 
“When he sent me that, it kind 
of hit me that he might be leaving. I 
tried to give him his space and not 
get involved, but he came up to me 
before we went out there today and 
said, ‘Let’s go get another one to -
gether,’ and a weight just came off 
my shoulders.”
Tebow said he made his deci -
sion Saturday afternoon and that he 
wanted to get it out of 
the way early, rather 
than wait until the 
Jan. 15 deadline, so he 
can relax and enjoy 
the Gators’ title win.
But his classmates, receiver Percy 
Harvin and linebacker Brandon 
Spikes, both potential first-round 
draft picks, have yet to choose, al -
though Harvin may have tipped his 
hand in a television interview after 
the celebration.
“I don’t know yet,” Harvin said. 
“I’m kind of leaning toward com -
ing back, but I haven’t made that 
decision. I’m going to sit down with 
coach Meyer (on Monday).”
Spikes spent Sunday afternoon with family rather than attend the 
ceremony, but fellow linebacker 
Ryan Stamper said UF’s leading 
tackler told him he planned to stay 
following the Gators’ 24-14 win 
against Oklahoma on Thursday night, and Spikes has stated several 
times that Tebow’s decision would 
be a big factor in whether he jumps 
to the NFL.
Should all three players return, 
they could take a page from UF’s 2006 national championship basket -
ball team, when stars Al Horford, 
Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer  and 
Taurean Green passed up NBA 
riches to return and successfully 
defend their title.QB’s decision to stay in school gives him time to enjoy championship
