Florida football player Andre Debose was 
pushed into a window while trying to break 
up a ﬁ  ght Saturday night. During the brawl, a man was arrested after he used his riﬂ  e to ﬁ  re several rounds into the SUV of the man who pushed Debose.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 23-year-old John Mark 
Honeycutt on charges of aggravated assault, according to an arrest report.Gainesville Police origi-
nally misreported Debose as the aggressor in the in-cident, but the most recent ofﬁ  cial account states the following: At about 6:30 p.m., ofﬁ  cers responded to reports of an argument 
among people armed with a handgun and riﬂ  e. Ear-
lier that evening, Honeycutt was eating at his house with Debose and two other people, GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said. His house is located in the 500 block of Northwest 36th Street, according to an arrest report.
An argument ensued, and a man pushed 
Debose into a window, shattering the glass, Tobias said. Debose was not injured. 
The man and Honeycutt began ﬁ  ghting, 
and Honeycutt threatened to kill him, accord-ing to the report. Tobias said Honeycutt got a handgun, but the man grabbed the gun and ﬁ  red into the ground outside.
Honeycutt then took a riﬂ  e and ﬁ  red sev-
eral rounds into the SUV, Tobias said.
When ofﬁ  cers arrived, they saw an SUV 
with several bullet holes parked in front of Honeycutt’s house.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Honeycutt into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 1:50 a.m. He was released at 2:53 p.m. Sunday after meeting a $2,000 bond.

UF President Bernie Machen an-
nounced he is temporarily ending 
the search for a new Levin College of Law dean.
In an email to law students Fri-
day, Machen wrote the candidates were accomplished but he and Pro-vost Joe Glover “did not ﬁ  nd one ideally suited to lead the College.”
In a separate email to law faculty 
and staff, Machen proposed that professor George Dawson take over as interim dean once current dean Robert Jerry vacates the position June 30.
Jerry announced in August he 
would step down but would remain a faculty member.
Final candidates in the search included David Brennen, dean and professor at University of Kentucky College of Law;  Samuel Donaldson, a Georgia State University College of Law  professor; and David Hueb-ner, a former ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said Machen will revisit opening the search sometime in the near future.
Megan Harsh, a 23-year-old 
UF ﬁ  rst-year law student, said she couldn’t believe the amount of effort that was put into ﬁ  nding a dean.
“I’m pretty disappointed that 
they used so much time and re-sources,” she said. 
Faculty and staff are invited to 
attend a private meeting Tuesday with Machen and Glover to dis-cuss Dawson’s nomination. The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. in Room 180 of the law school.

The air smelled like sunscreen, burning rubber and

the vibrating bleachers as a pair of dragsters rocketed down the quarter-mile track.
As spectator Jeremy Hudson put it, “It’s one of 
those sports — TV doesn’t do it justice.”
The 45th annual Amalie Motor Oil National Hot 
Rod Association Gatornationals returned to the Gainesville Raceway Thursday through Sunday, bringing with it about 100,000 spectators hooked on the speed and adrenaline of drag racing. 
Hudson, a 30-year-old Panama City resident, said 
he travels to Atlanta Braves games across the country, but he likes drag racing because the drivers are much more accessible than, say, professional baseball play-ers.

Wake up and smell the bacon ... 
with an app 
MADISON, Wis. — Want to 
wake up to the sound of bacon sizzling on the stove with its aroma drawing you out of bed?
There’s an app for that.Oscar Mayer says it has cre-
ated a bacon-scented app for the iPhone, developed by the Mad-ison-based company’s Institute for the Advancement of Bacon.
The company says that to 
emit a small puff reminiscent of bacon, the user needs an ex-ternal device that plugs into the headphone jack. The app itself produces the sound of bacon siz-zling in a pan.
Oscar Mayer says the aroma-
producing device won’t be sold in stores and that quantities are limited. The company is giving away 4,700 devices.
Oscar Mayer is part of Kraft 
Foods Group Inc., based in Glen-view, Ill.

In contrast, at Gatornationals, 
the pits resembled the midway of 
a county fair. In an area behind the grandstands, crews rebuilt engines and changed tires beneath colorful awnings attached to RVs and trail-ers. Spectators gathered to watch, and often, drivers walked over to chat with them.
That’s why Heather Walls, 35, 
came from Pennsylvania. 
“It’s a great fan experience be-
cause you get to talk to the driv-ers,” she said. “They’re not snob-by.” 
She noted drag races are the 
“closest you’ll get to celebrities, basically.”
If feeling close is a reason 
thousands of people ﬂ  ock to the track, it’s also a reason many out-of-towners choose to camp while they’re at Gatornationals.
Saturday afternoon, Gary and 
Patti Gullotta and Chris and Con-nie Ciccarone sat by a campﬁ  re in the sunny, 75-degree weather drinking Blue Moon and cracking peanuts. They’d been at the track earlier in the day, but they drove the three and a half miles back to their site at the Jaycees Camp-ground for some downtime.
“Camaraderie,” said Chris 
Ciccarone — that’s why he likes camping.
The 57-year-old has been com-
ing to the races and the camp-ground for more than 30 years.He said it’s mellowed out a lot. 
People used to tear through a huge mud pit at the edge of the camp-sites in their trucks.
“This used to be a real hell-rais-
ing place,” he said.
Now, the mudpit is indented 
and dry like a lakebed. A few peo-ple were even camping in it.
The wet T-shirt contest still 
takes place, but this group likes tamer activities like lively discus-sions about politics by ﬁ  relight.
“We’ve solved the world’s prob-
lems probably a hundred times last night,” said Gary Gullotta, 62.
They like wearing grungy 
clothes and not having to shower.
“No TV, no nothing. No grand-
kids, no job,” said Connie Cicca-rone, 56.
The campground has about 150 water hookups, which designate ofﬁ  cial campsites. But most of the property is an informal tent-camp-ing free-for-all, said Kristen Rabell, Jaycees board chairwoman.
“It’s random. We don’t count,” 
she said of the number of sites. She said the grounds have served as a Gatornationals crash pad for 40-plus years.
Racing fans come to the camp-ground from as far away as Cana-da, she said. The Jaycees’ camping option is cheaper than staying at the track’s facilities, which only al-low RVs. 
The relaxed policy has led to 
a sprawling network of homes-away-from-home as campers turn whatever spot they choose into a weekend paradise. Visitors added ﬂ  air with colorful electric lights, racing ﬂ  ags and strings of pen-nants. One site was decorated with an old, brittle Christmas tree adorned with beer bottles, Mardi Gras beads and a hubcap.
Lee Thompson from Hazel-
hurst, Ga., was camping with a block of about 20 people. When he has the money for tickets to the races, he goes, said 29-year-old Thompson, leaning on one elbow sprawled in a green pup tent. This year, he didn’t have the money to get onto the track, but he said the camping experience was enough in itself.
“A lot of drinkin’, eatin’ a lot of 
grilled food,” he said, adding that riding four-wheelers through the woods is a highlight, too. “It’s like a friend-family reunion. Every year, we try to bring more people.”
Laurie Sullivan, 50, and Earl 
Bass, 59, had just gotten into town Saturday afternoon. The couple from Bradenton was struggling to inﬂ  ate an air mattress. They planned to visit the races the next day. But for now, it was camp-ground time.
“That’s half the fun – relaxing, 
meeting people,” Sullivan said, taking a sip from her Bud Light can in a coozie. “Life is good today.”MONDAY, MARCH 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 4

from page 1GPD initially incorrectly reported Debose pushed a 
victim through a window. Tobias announced the mistake 
in a statement via Facebook, apologizing for the error while commending Debose for his actions.
“I am extremely proud that (Debose) intervened in this 
incident and likely prevented anyone from being injured or killed,” Tobias wrote.
The NCAA granted Debose a sixth year of eligibil-
ity on Thursday after he applied for a medical hardship waiver. The wide receiver missed the 2013 season after he suffered a torn ACL. Debose also missed his fresh-man season in 2009 due to a knee biceps femoris graft for a previous injury. In the three seasons he has played at Florida, wide receiver Debose recorded 29 receptions for 543 yards.

Tammy Lewis closed her eyes as 
about 200 people watched her shoul-
der-length silvery gray hair fall to the floor of the stage.
Lewis, 47, and Dwayne, her 7-year-
old son, were two of 38 participants who shaved their heads Friday on Fla-vet Field for the Freshman Leadership Council event known as St. Baldrick’s.
A charity dedicated to funding 
childhood cancer research, the St. Bal-drick’s Foundation held its first head-shaving event on St. Patrick’s Day in 2000.
This year, the FLC raised about 
$14,000, double the amount raised at the first St. Baldrick’s at UF, said Leigh Robertson, the 21-year-old UF political science junior.
Event organizer McLane Edwards, a 19-year-old UF political science fresh-man, said what began as an impulse decision became a mark of solidarity for childhood cancer patients.
“You can’t, like, really go into it 
thinking, ‘Aw, how am I going to look?’ because you’re gonna look goofy,” Ed-wards said. “That’s just how it’s going to be.”
Lewis, of Middleburg, Fla., was one 
of two women who participated in the head-shaving event.
She chose to volunteer in St. Bal-
drick’s at UF before she was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2013. She said she was nervous that the che-motherapy was going to take its toll on her hair before the event.
“It was getting to the point where I 
was wondering if (my hair) was going to last until today,” Lewis said, “and it held on for me.”
She said she participated to cele-
brate that Dwayne, her blind foster son who suffered from an eye cancer called bilateral retinoblastoma, has been can-cer-free for five years.After Lewis and her son finished 
getting their heads shaved, they joined in the middle of the stage to embrace and feel each other’s clean-shaven heads.
Cancer patients and survivors 
weren’t the only participants Friday, as about two dozen UF students vol-unteered to shave their locks for the cause.
Travis Dobler, a 21-year-old UF 
advertising junior and captain of the Florida Cicerones team, said this was his third time shaving his head for St. Baldrick’s.
He said he plans to become a four-
year shavee but realizes he must be creative to keep the donations coming.
This year, Dobler dyed the tips of 
his hair blond to draw attention to his locks and the event but said he acci-dentally dyed his entire scalp shortly afterwards. 
“You have to do these PR stunts to 
kind of keep people interested,” Dobler said, “or I just look like a guy who gets a free haircut once a year.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 17, 2014

More than 300 students, UF faculty and staff 
walked from Turlington Plaza to Emerson Hall pro-testing the Kofi Adu-Brempong shooting by Universi-ty Police. UF Ph.D. student Adu-Brempong was shot in the face with an AR-15 assault rifle at his apartment across from the Levin College of Law after about a two-hour standoff with police, according to Alliga-tor archives. The student was in critical condition at Shands hospital after the incident, and the officer involved in the shooting, Keith Smith, was eventu-ally cleared of any wrongdoing. The shooting raised questions in Alligator editorials about the police’s use of deadly force and UF’s handling of the event. “We will not be silent about this,” said Kwame Glover, Adu-Brempong’s nephew. “We’re grateful and we’re hopeful that justice will prevail.” 
March 19, 2001 The Alligator’s attorney, Thomas Julin, along with 
the Orlando Sentinel, fought in court to obtain Dale Earnhardt’s autopsy photos after his fatal crash in Daytona. The autopsy was sealed after Teresa Earn-hardt, Dale’s wife, sued the Volusia County Medical Examiner to not allow public access to the records. This led to public record law debate between the Orlando Sentinel and Earnhardt’s lawyers. Barbara Petersen, executive director of the First Amendment Foundation in Tallahassee, said the case set a bad precedent for public-information seekers.

CLAIRE BOUGH

Last week, the SAT announced major changes to its in-
famous test, and hopeful students are questioning how the 
changes will affect UF.
The main change to the test will occur in the writing por-
tion. According to a news release from The College Board, the essay is now optional, and the entire test will only be worth 1,600 points, rather than the previous 2,400.
At UF, either SAT scores or ACT scores are required from 
applicants, said Chandra Mitchell, UF’s director of freshman and international admissions.
She said there is not yet enough information for UF to de-
cide how to handle the newly optional essay in its admissions process.
However, she said the new SAT will not change the overall process of the way UF reviews applicants.
“SAT scores give us some solid information to include in 
our comprehensive review of applicants,” Mitchell said.
Catherine Wegner, an 18-year-old senior at East Lake High 
School in Tarpon Springs, was recently admitted to UF for the upcoming Summer semester. Even with the upcoming changes, she still doubts the SAT’s effectiveness.
“I do not believe the SAT accurately measures a student’s 
ability,” Wegner said. “The test will probably eventually be-come extinct.” 
Further changes to the SAT include removing the pen-
alty for answering questions incorrectly and a collaboration with Khan Academy for free online test preparation, which launches in Spring 2015, according to the news release.
William Hiss, the former dean of admissions at Bates Col-
lege and the principal investigator of a new study on SAT and ACT scores, said the Khan Academy classes acknowledge the problems associated with the coaching industry but don’t necessarily solve them.
The SAT now offers four college application waivers for 
each eligible low-income student. 
Hiss said this decision will bring a lot of economically dis-
advantaged students into universities across the nation who don’t submit their scores.
“I give them credit for trying to open up the access issue,” 
he said. “That is a nice small step that is perfectly reason-able.”
The College Board is also developing a curriculum for 
grades six to 12 that aligns with the tests it publishes. Hiss said he sees this as a conflict of interest.
“They’re not going to approve of a curriculum that can’t be 
easily measured by one of their tests,” he said.SAT essays now optional, effects on UF admissions undetermined

Target’s thigh gap Photoshop 
fail has drawn criticism from the 
Gainesville community.
The retailer posted last week an 
advertisement for a junior’s bath-ing suit on its website, and several bloggers noticed the glaring Pho-toshop errors on the picture. The model’s thigh gap, the nickname for the space between thighs, ex-tended into her pelvis. Parts of her  arms were obviously thinned.
Target acknowledged the error 
and removed the image.
Kali Kaufman, a 20-year-old 
UF psychology junior, said she felt outraged.
“I couldn’t tell if it was a mis-
take or if they meant to do it,” she said. 
Images like that can negatively 
inﬂ  uence girls, she said.
“I have a younger sister, and I 
do not want her to think it is OK  to look like that,” Kaufman said.
Research has established me-
dia like the Target advertisement contributes to increased body dissatisfaction among girls, said Natalie Rella, a GatorWell Health Promotion Services specialist.
“Being bombarded with these 
unrealistic and unattainable im-ages encourages girls and women to base their self-worth on appear-ance and can be a contributing fac-tor to the development of eating disorders,” she said.Thigh gap photo raises

The new Harry Potter-themed area open-
ing at Universal Orlando Resort this summer 
will allow fans to ride the Hogwarts Express train and experience the British countryside just as the characters did.
Guests will appear to magically pass 
through a brick wall and board a train with steam and a whistle, according to a Friday news release from Universal Orlando Resort.
Riders will have two experiences — one 
on the way to the new London-themed area at Universal Studios Park and another on the way to the original Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal’s Islands of Adventure. During the ride, characters and magical crea-tures from the book will be spotted. Among them: Hagrid on a ﬂ  ying motorbike, the Wea-sley twins on brooms, and the Knight Bus in London trafﬁ  c.
Universal’s team worked with a group 
from the Harry Potter ﬁ  lms on the new area and train.
If fans want to see both parks, a two-park

UF Subway and Chick-ﬁ  l-A locations 
will reﬂ  ect their national companies’ moves 
toward healthier and more organic ingredi-ents. 
UF’s on-campus restaurants plan to imple-
ment the changes, wrote Aramark marketing manager Jill Rodriguez in an email.
“Gator Dining follows national brand standards at our retail locations,” she wrote. “Many students and faculty/staff are con-scious of eating healthy and it is our respon-sibility to have these options available on campus for those who are looking for more healthy choices.”
According to a Subway news release, the 
sub chain is removing azodicarbonamide, a chemical that adds elasticity to bread. The change began in 2013 and should be com-plete in the coming weeks, according to the release.
Rebecca West, a Chick-ﬁ  l-A customer care 
representative, said the restaurant is remov-ing azodicarbonamide as well. The company is also working toward using chickens that haven’t been treated with antibiotics. 
“We’re trying to provide our customers 
with the freshest and highest quality menu options,” she said.
West said freshness is key to Chick-ﬁ  l-A.“We try to make sure that all of our in-
gredients are fresh and made to order,” she said.
Vanessa Garcia, a 20-year-old UF nutri-tional science sophomore, said antibiotics de-grade the quality of food. 
“I think it’s really important to watch 
what we eat, not only for the sake of keeping a healthy weight for students and faculty but also because what we put in our bodies affect our daily lives and how we do in school,” she said. 
Subway, Chick-ﬁ  l-A affected“We try to make sure that all of 
our ingredients are fresh and made

keep your mitts off 
the Everglades
Older Florida natives have witnessed the overdevelop-
ment of Florida in the past half century or so, and they’re not happy about it. Novelist, Miami Herald columnist 
and Alligator alumnus Carl Hiaasen has covered the issue ex-tensively; he told NPR last year, “Try to imagine ... the transfor-mation you would watch if you lived here. It’s traumatic.”
Enter Big Oil.According to NPR, Florida has granted a Texas oil company 
permission to drill an exploratory well in the western part of the Everglades in Naples. The Dan A. Hughes Co. is seeking permis-sion to build an injection well, which would produce millions of gallons of toxic brine as a result of the drilling process. And al-though the company claims there will be no fracking involved, Florida’s rules allow it to begin fracking if Dan A. Hughes Co. changes its mind.
Naples residents and environmental groups are calling on 
both the Environmental Protection Agency to deny the Dan A. Hughes Co.’s request and the state of Florida to reverse its deci-sion on exploratory drilling in the Everglades.
Preserve Our Paradise, a state advocacy group battling 
against an oil-industry takeover of the Everglades, has said there’s simply no reason for oil drilling in the state of Florida.
“There are only small amounts of fossil fuel in Florida, and 
with many forms of green energy available, there is simply no need to risk despoiling Florida in this way,” the group’s website reads. “As former Exxon executive Edward Glab has said, ‘The juice isn’t worth the squeeze.’”
It’s a dramatic narrative straight out of “Erin Brockovich”: Big 
company swoops in, tries to dupe locals and state ofﬁ  cials and exploits the resources of a struggling area. And while Floridians aren’t having any of it, the state seems OK with the drilling.
The head of Florida’s Petroleum Council assured NPR that 
new directional drilling techniques used by the oil industry al-low for minimal surface disturbances — essentially bringing to life the Coen Brothers’ satirical “Clean Coal” commercial, but this time, it’s “clean oil drilling.”
Florida’s legislature can’t bend to the will of oil companies 
promising proﬁ  t. The oil industry isn’t a self-policing operation, and even if safer oil-drilling techniques exist, allowing Texas companies in the western part of the Everglades not only under-mines Florida’s natural resources, it also undermines the state’s integrity.
An undercurrent of Floridians’ existing fear of overdevelop-
ment runs through the issue of oil drilling in the Everglades. Even if new technology is safer — which is a bold claim — resi-dents who’ve sought peace and solitude along the banks of the Everglades don’t want to see the area overrun by oil companies. Add this, of course, to the reality of toxic gases possibly being leaked into nature and neighborhoods. 
The U.S. doesn’t need the little amount of oil that Florida can 
offer. What we need is a longer-lasting solution — namely, less effort going toward developing clean-drilling techniques and more going toward discovering alternative energy sources.Election results not an accurate forecast
Political junkies across the state and throughout the 
country had their eyes ﬁ  xated on Pinellas County last week, wondering whether the result of a special 
election to ﬁ  ll Congressman Bill Young’s vacated seat was a sign of things to come. Young was a Republican who served the district for decades until he passed away late last year. The district is ﬁ  rmly Republican, but Democrats felt they had an opportunity to win the seat, especially with former gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink.
Sink had a strong lead in early polls as Republicans 
duked it out for the nomination. Ultimately, David Jolly, a former aide to Young, won the seat by 3,400 votes and kept a Republican seat in Republican hands. Now, politi-cos throughout the country are trying to use this special election to determine the outcome of this fall’s midterm elections.
Here’s why you shouldn’t listen to the pundits:Special elections tend to bring out only the most hard-
core voters. It’s incredibly difﬁ  cult to turnout Democrats in a midterm election, let alone a special election in the middle of March. Not trying to polish a turd — because Alex Sink had an opportunity to win and failed to do so — but this was a Republican seat won by a Republican in which about 125,000 voters turned out.
It is true that Democrats are not poised to do well in 
November, but that’s not strictly due to the current politi-cal climate. Rarely does the party of the incumbent presi-dent win seats in the second midterm elections. Remember 2006? Republicans took a bath after the American people seemed ready to move past George W. Bush.
Now, Republicans fully expect it’s their turn to bathe 
the Democrats and are hopeful that they’ll win additional seats in the House of Representatives. They feel conﬁ  dent they’ll take control of the U.S. Senate.
To my Republican friends: Be careful not to count your 
chickens before they’ve hatched.
Republicans are counting on an American electorate fed up with the policies of Presi-dent Barack Obama and are still riding the anti-Affordable Care Act train, but Obamacare may not be the pariah in November that it seems to be right now.
Just a quick update on the 
Affordable Care Act: More than 4 million Americans now have 
health insurance as a result of the law, and the White House is hoping that when the March 31 deadline rolls around, that number will increase to 6 million. What happens if millions of Americans who didn’t previously have health insurance get it, like it and realize that maybe Obamacare isn’t the socialistic, communistic, evil, terrible, no-good law Republicans say it is?
That rhetoric may work for a March special election in 
Pinellas County, but we still have more than seven months until voters across the country cast ballots. And while the American people might be getting Obama-fatigue, they may not reward the Republicans, either. The president’s approval ratings continue to hover in the low 40s, which isn’t particularly good, but when you look at Congress’ approval rating, the low 40s look like an A-plus rating. A recent poll conducted by Public Policy Polling shows Congress with an 8-percent approval rating.
Yes, only 8 percent of Americans approve of how mem-
bers of Congress are handling their jobs. Instead of Repub-licans winning in a so-called “wave” election, we instead may see a different wave — one in which challengers de-feat incumbents.
Regardless of which party controls the House and Sen-
ate come January of next year, there are likely to be some new faces around the Capitol and some shocked, recently defeated incumbents lamenting their losses at home.

National Security Agency phone tapper 
Joshua Mansfeld was surprised yes-terday to wire a phone call from some-
one he thought he’d never see in his queue: his own mother.
“I was paralyzed,” Mansfeld said, “I was 
so stunned, I accidentally whispered ‘Mom?’ into the headset.”
Mansfeld’s colleague Ralph Polowski de-
scribed the moment as “absolutely petrifying” and “more frightening than the thought that my profession actually exists.”
Witnesses say Martha Mansfeld, in re-
sponse to hearing her son’s voice for the ﬁ  rst time in 15 minutes when they spoke over Skype during his lunch break, simply repeat-ed, “Joshie? Joshie? Is that you, Joshie? Joshie?” nine times. Before she could hit 10, Patrick, the man who was selling her Tupperware for three payments of $39.99 from an infomercial during “The View,” interrupt-ed, saying, “No, this is Patrick.”
After four hours of investigation, the NSA 
identiﬁ  ed the man on the line as Patrick Mc-Connell, a 17-year Tupperware salesman from Naperville, Ill. He has a clean criminal record.
Martha persisted. “Just one moment, Patri-
cia,” she said. “I need to call my son. I think the landline just lost its Wi-Fi connection.”
The call was disconnected, and in D.C., 
Mansfeld’s phone rang.“I was so scared,” he said. 
“You know that moment when you look at your phone and you see it’s your mother calling? It was like that.”
Mansfeld wiped sweat from his brow and 
answered what is now the NSA’s second-most important phone call ever. The ﬁ  rst  was when New York resident Dan Druff ordered Middle Eastern take-out cuisine to his apartment.
Call logs from Mansfeld’s phone indicate 
the conversation lasted 18 minutes, mostly him just muttering “yep,” “uh-uh” and “OK.” 
During the ordeal, Martha asked her son 
why he hadn’t called home lately, if he had been wearing a sweater, if he’d met a woman yet and if he had been wearing a sweater.
Additionally, she asked how to ﬁ  x the, “Wi-
Fi for the landline,” unplugged the landline and then plugged it back in, which she claims did nothing. She called her technical help cen-ter, located in Bamra, India, where a Texas man named Steve aided her in ﬁ  xing what we now know was actually her microwave.
“It was terrifying for him,” said Timothy 
Turner, friend and co-worker of Mansfeld. “Deﬁ  nitely much worse than when Johnson had to listen in to his daughter call that Siberi-an phone sex operator. But hey, we’re all mak-ing sacriﬁ  ces to defend this great nation.”

ATLANTA — Standing at the free-
throw line on the front end of a one-and-
one with 23 seconds on the clock and Florida ahead of Kentucky 61-60, Scottie Wilbekin took three dribbles, bent down and released his shot.
No good.When his free throw rimmed out, 
Dorian Finney-Smith pulled down the re-bound and drew a foul on UK guard An-drew Harrison. 
Now, it was Finney-Smith’s turn to try 
to pad UF’s lead with a one-and-one op-portunity.
No good.The two misses set up an unfavorable 
situation for Florida: It would have to get one more stop on a Kentucky team that thrives when driving to the rim. 
It was a difficult task, but the seasoned 
Gators put their missed free throws behind them and showed their wisdom in a 61-60 victory Sunday against the No. 2 seed Wildcats in the Southeastern Conference Tournament final Sunday in the Georgia Dome.
Florida had learned too many lessons 
from the past to mishandle a late-game situation like this. 
For the Gators, what went wrong dur-
ing their loss to UConn in December — one that saw Shabazz Napier sink a jumper at the buzzer because of a defensive break-down by UF — came to mind immediately in their huddle as Kentucky coach John Calipari called timeout with 14 seconds left.“We just said everybody box your man 
out so they don’t hurt us on the second shot,” Wilbekin said. 
“Don’t run to the rim like we did at 
UConn.”
The strategy worked.Out of the timeout, Harrison wasted 
about 10 seconds of clock — what he ad-mitted postgame was too much time — and looked to dish it off to Wildcats guard James Young at the right corner. Wilbekin guarded Harrison, while Michael Frazier II monitored Young.
Harrison passed it to Young, and both 
Wilbekin and Frazier converged on Young at the right elbow. 
While all of this was happening, UF’s

Gators survive last-minute free-throw woes to win SEC Tourney
JONATHAN CZUPRYN 
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
ATLANTA – When Scottie Wilbekin slumped down in 
his chair in the dimly lit press-conference room located in 
the bowels of the Jacksonville Memorial Arena on Nov. 25, he did not look like a winner.
The senior point guard had just made his 2013-2014 
debut after serving a five-game suspension for violating team rules and now it was time to apologize to his friends, family and fans for his lack of responsibility.
So on Sunday, when Wilbekin — with a smile plastered 
on his face and confetti clinging to his championship T-shirt — stepped up to accept his Southeastern Conference Tournament MVP award after a 61-60 win over Kentucky, it was not just a testament of his team’s accomplishment, but also of his ability to mature in just 112 days.
When asked how the Gators survived the ups and 
downs of this season and come out with a perfect league record and No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament, Wilbekin’s answer could have almost applied to his own personal journey as well.
“It was a struggle at 
times,” Wilbekin said. “We came back from deficits, and that’s just 
what we do. 
“We try to fight through any adversity that’s in front 
of us and just stick together as a team because that’s what we are. We’re a team.”With a renewed Wilbekin at the helm of this Florida 
squad, the Gators earned their first tournament title since coach Billy Donovan won it three straight times from 2005 to 2007.
The nail-biting victory also made UF the first SEC 
school to win both the regular-season and tournament championship in the same year since that 2007 national-title squad.
And like Wilbekin, the Gators climbed their way to 
perfection by letting go of the past, which was marred by constant letdowns in their biggest opportunities for suc-cess.
In 2011 — this senior group’s inaugural season — Flor-
ida reached the SEC title game for the first time since 2007 but fell by 16 to Kentucky.
Two years later, Wilbekin and the Gators entered the 
league championship as the favorites but were shocked Wilbekin finds redemption, is named tournament MVPSee SeC, PA ge 15

Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
ATLANTA — After the confetti 
fell and the nets were cut, Florida 
learned its spot in the NCAA Tour-nament.
As expected, the Gators captured 
the No. 1 overall seed.
UF, the No. 1 seed in the South 
Region, will face either Albany or Mount St. Mary’s on Thursday in Or-lando. Both No. 16 seeds will square off on Tuesday.
Fresh off a 61-60 win against Ken-
tucky in the Southeastern Conference Tournament Championship, Florida is ready for the next step in the sea-son.
“Coach [Billy Donovan] told us 
that after tonight, when we wake up in the morning, this is in the past,” sophomore Michael Frazier II said. “So I think we got to do a good job of understanding that we need to focus on our next point and focus on our next goal.”
Mount St. Mary’s (22-11, 11-7 West 
Coast Conference) is coming off a 70-54 loss to Gonzaga — the No. 8 seed in the West Region — in the WCC semifinals on Monday.
Albany (18-14, 9-7 American 
East) was rewarded for its 69-60 win against Stony Brook in the American East Tournament with a shot to make it to the Big Dance.
If UF wins its second-round con-
test on Thursday, Florida will contin-ue on in the tournament to play the winner of No. 8 seed Colorado and No. 9 seed Pittsburgh.
The rest of the South Region will 
prove to be a tough ride for Florida, with Kansas, Syracuse and UCLA earning the second, third and fourth seeds, respectively.
“I think we have the kind of confi-
dence that we can lineup against any-one,” senior Patric Young said. “We think if we’re playing the right way, that there’s no one we can’t beat.”
“But we have to go and do what 
we did after the regular season was over, start right from the bottom. It starts with the practices, just coming in every single day with a mindset of still getting better, fine tuning our offense and utilizing each other bet-ter.”
Florida struggles at the charity 
stripe: Before they headed to Atlanta for the SEC Tournament, the Gators connected on 67.9 percent of their free-throw shots.
But once they entered the Georgia 
Dome, they couldn’t keep that pace.
Florida managed to connect on 
only half of its shots from the char-ity stripe through its three tourna-ment games. Outside of senior Casey Prather’s 12-of-17 clip from the line, no Florida player made more than half of his attempts from the free throw line.
“There’s always areas we can get 
better on. I think free throw shooting is an area we can improve,” Donovan said after Florida’s 56-49 win against Tennessee on Saturday. “We spend time, those guys put time in on their own, we put time in practice. Hope-fully that will be an area this time of year that we can get better at, because I think we’re capable of doing that.”

Rebels.
It took until the seniors’ backs were against the wall for the last time in conference play when they finally stepped up and showed their resiliency.
“What I would say that our 
guys have learned is in the mo-ment of something negative hap-pening, being able to move past it and let it go and refocus to the next thing,” Donovan said. “That’s what they have learned to do. That’s where I think we have got-ten better is we’re a better focused team moving past runs adversity, mistakes, challenges, things not going our way.”
Now, everything is going the 
Gators way. Even when they clank two free throws off the rim in a one-point game, they stuck the course and focused on stopping Kentucky on the other side of the court.
Wilbekin, who missed the first 
of Florida’s two missed shots from the charity stripe down the stretch, went into the huddle and talked about how the team could prevent the Wildcats from scor-ing. Not once did the squad men-tion the missed free throws.
And as a result, the Gainesville 
native and SEC Player of the Year made what Donovan called the most important move of the game. Wilbekin forced Kentucky’s An-drew Harrison to his right on the final possession rather than sur-rendering the center of the lane.
That defensive scheme led to 
Harrison dumping off the ball to teammate James Young, who slipped and fell to give the Gators the win.
“So we were just put in the 
right situations, and didn’t allow us not doing what we normally do in those situations to allow us to not do the next thing,” senior Pat-ric Young said. 
“So we put our past mistakes of 
not stopping their runs and foul-ing too much behind us and just moved on to the next thing, which is what helped us get it done to-night.”MONDAY, MARCH 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The problems began four pitches in.
Florida starter A.J. Puk failed to cover first base in time 
on a ground ball to Peter Alonso from leadoff hitter An-drew Benintendi. 
Alonso’s toss went above the 6-foot-7 freshman’s glove, 
allowing Benintendi to take second. He scored on a sacri-fice fly to center field two batters later.
The Razorbacks (9-7, 1-2 SEC) took advantage of Puk’s 
ineffective start in a 9-3 victory against the Gators (13-7, 2-1 SEC) in a McKethan Stadium series finale Sunday af-ternoon. 
The loss snapped Florida’s seven-game winning streak 
and spoiled the return of sophomore center fielder Har-rison Bader in his first game back since serving a 19-game suspension.
Logan Shore and Eric Hanhold, the Game 1 and Game 
2 starters, held Arkansas to one run in 11.1 combined in-nings. Puk surrendered three in two frames. 
“Honestly I don’t want to say anything. He struggled. 
He wasn’t hitting spots. Everything was up,” catcher Braden Mattson said. “He didn’t seem ready to play, and sometimes that happens with young players. We’ll move on. Hopefully he figures it out.”
Puk dazzled Connecticut on March 8 with a career-high 
seven strikeouts. Arkansas chased him in the third after a three-run second inning that frustrated Florida in the field and at the plate.
Catcher Jake Wise, hitting seventh, started the inning 
with a wind-aided home run that resembled a fly ball as high as the O’Connell Center off the bat. It hooked from left-center to just barely inside the foul pole to give Ar-kansas a two-run lead. Puk walked two of the next four batters before Brian Anderson doubled them home.
Taylor Gushue opened the bottom half with a single to 
left field only to have Alonso follow with a fly ball out to right. The wind turned the hard-hit ball into a routine out. Justin Shafer scored Gushue on a sacrifice fly.
“Fly balls would carry a little more down the lines,” 
Bader said. “It might play back into fair territory so you need to be aware of that. Down the line, those balls you might normally need to catch on the warning track might get out. It’s definitely difficult a little bit, but you just have to adapt to it on the field.”
Arkansas added two more runs on a wild pitch and a 
sacrifice bunt in the fourth inning when right-hander Dane Dunning walked the first two batters he faced. The Razor-backs scored three more in the ninth off relievers Shaun Anderson and Karsten Whitson.
Florida found itself down five runs before Bader came 
up for his second at-bat. The sophomore, hitting third, was contrite after the game addressing his Feb. 2 scooter acci-dent that resulted in a DUI investigation.
Bader singled and doubled in his first game back. Flor-
ida had eight hits compared to Arkansas’ nine, but never could take advantage of the run opportunities on Sunday that had been few and far between this series.
After Mattson drove in Bader and Gushue in the fourth 
on a single to left field, freshman Buddy Reed grounded into an inning-ending 4-6-3 double play that left the bases loaded. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan called it the turning point on Sunday.
A poor start carried over to the plate in the three-hour, 
14-minute game that Florida never controlled. It doesn’t get any easier for the Gators with a Tuesday-night home matchup against the No. 2 Seminoles. 
“We play a really good schedule. We’re getting into 
the meat of it now,” O’Sullivan said. “We’re excited about it.”Poor pitching 
dampens Bader’s 
return to lineupbASEbAll Florida defeated Kentucky for third 
time this season in tournament final
frontcourt boxed out in preparation for a field-goal 
attempt. 
It never came.Flustered, Young tripped, losing handle of the ball 
with about two seconds left.
“We did a great job of communicating,” Frazier 
said. “[Wilbekin] played good defense and then I was just able to stay with [Young] and he fell.”
With time dwindling and the ball up for grabs, 
Wilbekin and Harrison converged on it. As both were in a tussle on the ground, the buzzer rang and Florida had its first SEC Tournament title since 2007 signed, sealed and delivered. 
“Last time we played Kentucky at our place, there 
was a loose ball that I didn’t dive on, and Will (Yeg-uete) and Casey (Prather) yelled at me for not div-ing on the ball, and I felt bad,” Wilbekin said. “So I thought about that, and there was no way I wasn’t going to dive on it this game.”
What helped a veteran Florida group edge past a 
young Kentucky team Sunday was experience. It has been a quality the Gators have displayed all season, and the final moments of the SEC Tournament em-bodied that.
“Where you could have come out of that timeout 
Kentucky called with 14 seconds, Dorian Finney-Smith hanging his head, Wilbekin hanging his head, ‘I missed the free throw, can’t believe it,’” coach Billy 
Donovan said. 
“Now they’re not even thinking about the next 
possession. They’re worried about what happened at 
the free-throw line. They did that in their career. That was a problem for them. 
“They have gotten better through those experienc-
es. That’s where I think we have gotten better is we’re a better focused team moving past runs adversity, mistakes, challenges, things not going our way.”SEC , from page 13

a ﬁ  rst-round, 25-over-par deﬁ  cit 
to ﬁ  nish eighth out of 14 teams in their only home tournament of the season.
No. 16 Florida ﬁ  nished 892 
(+52) at the SunTrust Gator Women’s Invitational, doubling the score of winner Arizona. The No. 12 Wildcats took home the team title while Miami’s Dan-iela Darquea carded 214 (+4) to win the individual title.
“The tournament as a whole 
was disappointing; we really dug ourselves a big hole that ﬁ  rst day,” coach Emily Glaser said. “We’ll try to take the posi-tives out of today and move on from there.”
The three-day tournament 
play was affected by strong winds, which reached 20 mph during the third round.
“This is as hard as I’ve ever 
seen this golf course play,” Gla-ser said. “I thought we hung in there fairly well given the con-ditions, and it played tough for everyone.”
Junior Camilla Hedberg, who 
tied for ﬁ  fth with a tournament-high 12 birdies and a season low score of 216 (+6), described the course as being “completely dif-ferent.”
“As a team we didn’t do 
great, we were expecting a lot more,” Hedberg said. “Indi-vidually, I did play good. I had a good week. I’m not too happy with how I ﬁ  nished my round today, but I really can’t com-plain.”
This is the third consecutive 
year that Hedberg has placed in the top 10 at the Mark Bostick Golf Course. 
Freshman Karolina Vlckova 
tied for 13th as an individual competitor during the ﬁ  rst home competition of her colle-giate career with a score of 219 (+9). Both senior Elcin Ulu and freshman Maria Torres landed in the top-50 after shooting a combined nine birdies and 30 bogeys.
Redshirt sophomore Katie 
Mitchell shot four birdies over the course of three days and tied for 54th with a score of 230(+20). Junior Sarah Schober ﬁ  nished two strokes behind Mitchell in 59th.
Sophomore Ursa Orehek 
shot a single birdie during the ﬁ  rst two rounds, but landed at 68th after shooting only bogeys the third day of individual com-petition.
Florida now looks to the 
three-day Bryan National Col-legiate Tournament in North Carolina on March 28.
“Last year, Greensboro was 
very, very wet and very, very cold,” Glaser said. “We just need to go up there, have a good practice round and adapt.”

It seems that as the Gators have moved 
through the season, they haven’t gotten better 
— they’ve gotten worse.
Florida ended its weekend at the three-day 
Chris Schenkel Invitational in 13th place out of the 15-team ﬁ  eld. The Gators shot their worst round, 300 (+12), on Sunday, ﬁ  nishing with a total score of 890 (+26).
Georgia Southern, the host team playing 
on its home course in Statesboro, Ga., retained its ﬁ  rst-place spot from Saturday, winning the tournament with a collective 850 (-14) score.
An Eagle also took the individual title. 
Scott Wolfes shot 68 (-4) on Sunday, his best round of the tournament, to ﬁ  nish with a 209 (-7) total.
In terms of the Gators’ performance, coach 
Buddy Alexander was candid.
“Probably the low point in the season as far 
as I am concerned,” he said. 
‘The biggest disappointment from my 
standpoint has been our inability to learn and improve.”
Eric Banks and Ryan Orr were the only two Gators who had at least one positive to take out of Sunday’s performance. Banks was the high-est ﬁ  nishing Gator, tying for 20th place with a third round score of 71 (-1). This matched his second-round score and put him at a total of 217 (+1).
Orr improved two strokes from Saturday, 
shooting 74 (+2) and bringing his tournament total to 224 (+8).
J.D. Tomlinson ﬁ  nished inside the top 50, 
tying for 49th place, with a total of 223 (+7). Although he played decently in the ﬁ  rst two rounds, shooting 74 and 73, he struggled in the third round, managing a 76 score.
Richard Donegan, Victor Tarnstrom and 
Santiago Gavino can all say the same about their ﬁ  nal rounds. Donegan got worse throughout the week-
end, shooting rounds of 74, 77 and 79, and ﬁ  nishing 14 strokes over par with a 230 total. Tarnstrom fell apart on Sunday after he shot a third-round score of 85, 13 strokes over par. He ended the tournament with rounds of 76, 73 and 85 with a total of 234 (+18).
Gavino, who competed as an individual, 
totaled 232 (+16) on the weekend. In the third round, he shot 77, ﬁ  ve over par, but had scored 73 on Saturday.
“This team has an uncanny ability to hit the 
ball into the worst place possible, in spite of our strategy to the contrary prior to the round or the shot,” Alexander said. “I don’t know if they can’t hear, don’t listen or simply can’t help it.”
