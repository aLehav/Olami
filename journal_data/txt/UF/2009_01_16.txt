An ordinance that puts pressure on bars, restaurants and 
clubs that violate underage drinking laws is one step closer to 
becoming law after the Gainesville City Commission unani-mously passed its first reading at a meeting Thursday.
The ordinance allows the city to prohibit establishments 
that rack up violations from  admitting patrons younger than 21 between 9 p.m. and 2 a.m. The commission will meet again on Feb. 5 to decide the ordinance’s fate in the final reading.
“These are only establishments that, in the realm of their re-
sponsibility, have engaged in illegal acts,” said Commissioner Jack Donovan, who acted as mayor pro tempore in Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan’s absence.
Assistant City Attorney Stephanie Marchman told com-
missioners the ordinance is not a wide-sweeping ban and is the least restrictive approach possible.
If the ordinance was in place today, only 12 of the city’s 400 
alcohol-serving establishments would be affected, she said in a phone interview before the meeting.
Underage drinking in bars and restaurants in downtown 
and midtown are putting a strain on the Gainesville Police Department’s staff and budget, said GPD Capt. Lonnie Scott.

If there’s one thing besides na-
tional championships that UF 
should be getting used to by now, it’s budget cuts.
On Thursday , exactly a week after UF toppled Oklahoma in the BCS National Championship Game, President Bernie Machen an-nounced to the Faculty Senate that UF will start preparing for massive 
budget cuts.
Because of a predicted state bud-
get that is $3.4 billion less than this 
year’s, Machen said UF will ask each college and administrative unit to submit budget proposals for the 
2009-2010 fiscal year with 10 per -
cent cuts.
Added up, the cuts would entail 
a university-wide budget that is $72 million to $75 million leaner than the 2008-2009 budget.
The budget cut for 2008-2009 was 
$47 million.
Machen said the 10 percent bud-
get cut he is asking for is only an es-
timate suggested by lawmakers. 
He said this is a worst-case sce-
nario but noted other state universi-
ties are preparing for the same sized cut.
Ultimately, UF won’t know ex-
actly how much is being cut from the 2009-2010 budget until the Florida Legislature decides the state budget 
during the spring session, which 
runs from March 1 to May 1.Machen: UF faces massive budget cuts

Charles Grapski, 43, was released from jail 
Thursday after he spent 91 days locked up  on two misdemeanor charges. 
A trial was held for the controversial politi-
cal activist, known for going on hunger strikes protesting what he saw as his unfair  jail sen-tences.
Grapski was arrested Oct. 12 after he re-
portedly broke the door window at the house of his friend of eight years and entered without permission while the man had guests over.
The first witness, owner of the house Mark 
Kiester, said he instructed one of the guests to call 911 after Grapski broke the window.
At the scene, Gainesville Police officers 
told Kiester to choose whether officers should write Grapski a notice to appear in court or physically arrest him, said State Attorney’s Office spokesman Spencer Mann.
Kiester said he chose to have Grapski phys-
ically arrested because his guest wouldn’t stay if Grapski was in the area. 
Grapski was arrested at 3:13 a.m. and 
charged with criminal mischief and trespass-ing. 
He was placed in the Alachua County Jail 
without bond because this arrest violated his terms of probation from two past felonies, Grapski released from jail after pleading no contestUFAdministration

Poodle left inside vehicle for 19 days
SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt. (AP) — Police say a poodle mis-
takenly left for nearly three weeks inside a van in a Vermont 
airport parking garage has survived.
The 12-year-old miniature poodle lost half its body weight 
and endured subzero temperatures. Police believe it was with-out food and water for 19 days.
The male dog was discovered Jan. 6 after someone reported a 
foul odor coming from the vehicle. The owner, 50-year-old Pascal Bellon of Frelighsburg, Quebec, said he didn’t know the dog was in the vehicle. He was issued a ticket for cruelty to animals and agreed to give up custody of the pet and pay veterinary bills.n UF students

Sentinel to report his daughter’s 
excessive texting after reading 
an article on the Web about a 
California girl who topped 14,000 in a month.
Emilee’s highest month was 
June, when she tallied 35,463 mes-sages, or about 1,182 a day. She 
attributed the spike to constantly 
trading text messages with friends while she was at cheerleading 
camp.
A spokeswoman for Sprint

Mothers on hunger strike 
for school budget cuts 
MIAMI (AP) — Two mothers 
in Miami-Dade County are pro-
testing budget cuts within the 
school district by staging a hun-ger strike.
Bibiana Salmon and Malexys 
Morales have been on strike since Monday. They say they are fed 
up by massive budget cuts to the 
Miami-Dade School District and vow to stay put inside their tents 
staked outside Ronald Reagan 
Doral Senior High School in a western Miami suburb.
Salmon says she wants school 
district and state officials to pay attention because “this is the fu-
ture of our children we’re talk-
ing about.” She wants pay raises for teachers and to keep elective 
courses for students.
School district spokesman 
John Schuster says the frustration is understandable. He suggests 
that the mothers go directly to state legislators.

Wildlife officials say the pri-

Gary Morse with the Florida

is thought to have escaped from an unlicensed source. It was last 
seen in Clearwater.

Standard toothbrushes 
are out at Lee County Jail 
FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — 
Standard toothbrushes are out 
at the Lee County Jail, as officials 
try to take a potential weapon out of inmates’ hands.
This week, the jail is bring-
ing in brush tips that fit on the finger.
Sgt. David Velez says tooth-
brushes are among the most commonly altered items found 
in cells during random shake-
downs. Staffers remove any-thing being used for purposes 
other than what was originally 
intended.
The move wasn’t sparked by 
any recent events, Velez says, but as a precaution to protect both inmates and officers.
About 700 unused, hand-
held brushes at the jail will be donated to the Children’s 
Advocacy Center, which works 
with abused and neglected chil-dren.
Shoplifter run over by
getaway car twice 
CAPE CORAL, Fla. (AP) 
— Authorities are looking for 
a shoplifter who was run over 
twice by her getaway car after stealing $1,200 worth of de-
signer purses from a Cape Coral 
store.
A T.J. Maxx security guard 
told police she saw a woman stuff six designer Dooney & Bourke purses into her pants 
Tuesday morning and walk out 
of the store. The guard says she was confronting the woman 
when a car pulled up.
A report says the shoplifter 
tried to get into the vehicle but fell out and was run over by the 
car.
She then got up and jumped 
onto the hood of the car. As the car was driving away, the report says the woman fell off and was 
run over again. On her third at-
tempt, she finally made it into the vehicle.
Police are using the car’s 
license plate and a check the woman dropped to track her 
down.

Carless student wins $1,000 in eco-friendly gas
He does not have a car, but he 
won free eco-friendly fuel for a 
year. 
Josh Nicdao, UF athletic train-
ing junior, received a phone call 
last week telling him he had won the free fuel contest sponsored by the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council as a part of the 2008 Fox TailGate Tour.
Nicdao, who said he has never 
won a contest before, decided to enter the contest with his friends during the UF-LSU game in October to get a free T-shirt.
Nicdao said he is not sure what 
he is going to do with his $1,000 check, but he does recognize the importance of the contest and its ethanol-enriched fuel.
“I guess it’s like an easy way to 
let everybody know how impor -
tant the environment is and how endangered it is,” Nicdao said.

Barhoppers now have a one-
stop source for finding the cheap-
est drink deals and night clubs 
around Gainesville. 
On Jan. 1, UF finance juniors 
Justin Aiello and Daniel Noste launched GatorNites.com, a Web 
site profiling the night clubs and 
bars in town.
Since its launch, the site has re-
ceived more than 5,500 hits. 
Aiello and Noste dreamed up the Web site while taking an entre-preneurship course together.
After pooling their resources, 
Aiello said they came up with 
$5,000 and used only $1,000 to 
launch the Web site.
He said the rest was spent on 
promoting their product.
“It’s a market that hasn’t been 
saturated,” Aiello said. “The only reliable, current source for drink specials is monthly print publica-tions.”
“The site was really easy to 
navigate,” said Alexa Stickel, a UF psychology junior who found 
the XS free ladies’ night special on 
GatorNites.com. “I liked that they offer prizes and raffles. I don’t think you get that benefit with any 
other site.”
On Wednesday night, the site’s 
owners were at XS promoting their 
new site.“The students at UF don’t want 
to go to 10 different Web sites to find out where they want to go,” Aiello said. “They want to go to 
one.”
GatorNites.com profiles bars 
and clubs who pay a monthly ad-
vertising fee to be featured on the site and post drink specials.
Students can scope out the 
scene for free and leave feedback on what they’re looking to get out of their club or bar experience. 
“There’s so many options in 
Gainesville, so many bars or clubs out there, it narrows down what’s out there,” Stickel said. 
The owners and their presi-
dent of marketing, UF finance ju-
nior Eric Wolf, do all the legwork, 
Aiello said. 
He said they search for the most 
popular scenes and try to convince bar and club owners to give stu-
dents what they’re craving. 
Each profile gives a description 
of the club or bar, its age limit, mu-
sic and drink specials. Some clubs 
even allow for online bottle reser -
vations.Students launch one-stop source for drink specials
 UF SENT 53 ALUMNI OVERSEAS 
WITH THE PROGRAM LAST YEAR.

In addition to football, UF also takes the 
No. 1 ranking in Peace Corps volunteer re-
cruitment for the Southeast, having sent 53 
alumni overseas last year.
On-campus recruiter and UF graduate 
student Amy Panikowski said UF has held the No. 1 spot in the Southeast for the past 
four years.
“This generation is a generation of ser -
vice,” Panikowski said. “A lot of Florida stu-dents had to volunteer in high school, and 
these kids have continued to serve.”
Nationally, UF is ranked at No. 15, 
Panikowski said. UF has received high rank-
ings in the past nationally, she said, adding 
she would like to see its current status im-prove.
Panikowski said UF’s national ranking 
might rise if more students take advantage of programs at UF that prepare participants well for the Peace Corps, such as the teacher train-ing program in UF’s College of Education.
She said UF’s current rankings might stem 
from specific programs offered at UF to help students gain the skills they need in order to do well in the Peace Corps, such as language and agriculture programs.
“Students can find tangible skill sets here,” 
she said. “Everyone has something to offer.”
UF linguistics junior Zak Rinehart plans 
to join once he graduates. He hopes to teach English as a second language in Asia or 
Eastern Europe.
“I really want to serve my 
country and the military isn’t for me,” he said. “This will make an impact on other people.”
Another reason for the increase seen in 
Peace Corps volunteers could be the cur -
rent state of the economy and job market. However, Rinehart doesn’t think that a strug-gling economy should be the driving force behind students’ decisions to join.                        
“It’s not a way to get out of working,” 
Rinehart said. “This is not something to be taken lightly.”
Panikowski agrees. She said the Peace 
Corps is not for people who want to delay getting into the work force.
“The Peace Corps is for people who are 
tired of reading about the problem and want to be part of the solution,” she said.               
She also said that the 27-month nonstop 
commitment sets Peace Corps volunteers above others when applying for jobs or to 
graduate schools.
“You’re not losing anything by spending 
two years overseas,” Panikowski said. UF leads Southeast region in Peace Corps recruitment

Student Government-funded renova-
tions over winter break have ended in the 
student organization wing of the Center for Student Activities and Involvement on the third floor of the Reitz Union.
The work space for student organiza-
tions at UF was reconstructed using the $60,000 in SG funding allocated last July.
New additions include extra cubicles, 
office furniture, power and Internet work 
stations, outlets and storage cabinets. 
Senate President Jordan Johnson said lack of office space is the primary com-plaint by SG-funded organizations. 
“In my opinion, these student organi-
zations are at the heart of what Student 
Government is,” Johnson said.
Student organizations that wish to uti-
lize the reconfigured workspace, which now offers 13 cubicles and 34 storage spac-es, must apply each year.  
A lounge area and a conference table 
were also added. 
Alex Rabionet, a UF integrative biol-
ogy senior, was using the lounge area as a place to study in between classes.
“I definitely didn’t notice it before,” Rabionet said. “It caught my eye.”
Johnson said he worked with Nancy 
Chrystal-Green, the director of the center, 
on the design and layout of the project. 
Chrystal-Green said 
she got input from stu-dent organizations.
“I made sure we picked 
products that would be 
pretty sturdy and also 
have an orange-and-blue 
theme that you will notice,” she said.
Chrystal-Green said the new workspac-
es have yet to be assigned. But student groups that already have 
space for the 2008-2009 academic year are enjoying the new layout. 
Martina Harte, a UF sophomore who 
is involved with Florida Players, is happy with the new workspace. 
“Honestly, it’s just good to have the 
space for our stuff,” said Harte.
As for changes in the future, Chrystal-
Green hopes continue renovations in the 
other parts of the center. 
“I don’t have any solid plans right now. 
We just don’t have the funds,” Chrystal-
Green said. “I do have a ton of a wish list.”n THE OPPOSING GROUPS

One hundred black balloons and 
a banner displaying 6,000 red dots 
blew in the wind on Turlington Plaza Thursday afternoon as two 
groups of students representing 
each side of the Gaza conflict pro-
tested separately for four hours.
An archway of balloons, each 
balloon symbolizing 10 lives lost 
in Gaza, hung above members of Islam on Campus, the Arabic 
Cultural Association and College 
Democrats.
Meanwhile, students from 
the Jewish Student Union, Hillel Jewish student center and College 
Republicans held a banner showing 
the 6,000 rockets that have been re-portedly launched into Israel since the cease-fire, according to Sandy 
Baum, an English senior and stu-
dent activist.
Although there are not many 
issues the two sides have been able to agree upon, one point both 
groups stand behind is that UF stu-
dents should become more educat-ed about the conflict. 
“We’re here to raise aware-
ness about what’s going on,” said Jonathan Bull, vice president of 
external relations for Islam on 
Campus.
Jewish Student Union board 
member Ben Erez agreed that stu-
dents need to be more informed 
on the issues surrounding the con-flict. 
“The only people who are voic-
ing their opinions are those who are pro-Israel or pro-Palestine,” 
Erez said.
The anti-Hamas protesters en-
couraged students to write their 
congressmen about the issue, while the pro-Gaza demonstrators 
presented statistics to educate stu-
dents.
Overall, the protest was peace-
ful. However, a short-lived tension rose around 2 p.m. when inflam-matory remarks were made, Bull said. “People are too emotional to 
have a rational conversation,” said Emily Bernstein, a UF senior Jewish studies major. “It’s fine if it’s a one-on-one basis, but you can’t shout.”Campus protests educate students on Gaza conflictFRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 2009 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Forgetting to set your alarm has never seemed so inno-
cent, especially when a 50-year-old man “morking the 
mindy” stands in the way of getting to class.
The Editorial Board pours a we-will-never-think-of-hand-
lotion-in-the-same-way DART into the hands of the RTS 
masturbator for transforming a Dave Chappelle comedy 
sketch into a midmorning nightmare.
Would we be shocked to hear hand lotion sales at area 
supermarkets have skyrocketed since the story broke?
Probably not.As dollar bills seem to only appear in Geico commer -
cials these days, the Editorial Board recognizes the City Commission for thinking outside the box. Faced with the prospect of having to lay off a portion of the police force, 
the commission created legislation that will cut down on the 
Party Patrol presence in Midtown. 
With too many underage kids getting tipsy anyway, 
we present a J-Kwon inspired teen-drinking-is-very-bad LAUREL to the City Commission for their efforts to do the 
right thing when balancing the budget.
Given the opportunity to own up to eight years of run-
ning the country into the ground, President George W. Bush once again failed to save face. 
The Editorial Board graciously bestows an admitting-you-
made-mistakes-is-only-half-the-battle DART to the soon-to-
be former president as he rides off into the Crawford, Texas, 
sunset. And so we have reached the final hour of the Bush 
Dynasty — bringing the number of times the Yale grad’s name will grace the esteemed pages of the Alligator to single 
digits.
While we wish Percy Harvin the best of luck at the next 
level and graciously thank him for his contributions to the team, we can’t help but wonder why he couldn’t be a little 
more like his defensive counterpart. 
The Editorial Board awards linebacker Brandon Spikes 
a thank-you-for-helping-secure-UF-a-preseason-No. 1-rank-ing LAUREL for putting his entry into the NFL Draft on hold 
for another season. With millions of dollars just waiting to be 
snagged and the limelight of playing on Sundays, Spikes’ de-
cision to return to school renews hope of the Gators bringing home another championship to Gainesville. 
Not exactly a slam dunk choice, though — especially con-
sidering the fact he could’ve used his hefty wages to secure a top-notch attorney for his currently incarcerated brother.
With temperatures plummeting so low you can see the 
steam from a mouse fart, the Editorial Board can’t help but think about the innumerable homeless people living in and 
around Gainesville. 
As much as the local shelters have stepped up their efforts 
to lend a helping hand, we are forced to call out the city of Gainesville for making homelessness into seemingly a non-
issue. We shake our collective heads as we award the City 
of Gainesville a where-the-bleep-is-the-one-stop-shelter? 
DART for failing to deliver on promises of a better facility 
for the city’s growing homeless population.
While we aren’t a bunch of complainers, working at the 
Alligator can make it pretty tough to enjoy home-cooked meals. Late nights and tight deadlines don’t exactly bode well for developing our inner Bobby Flay. 
Since the Editorial Board doesn’t know a spork from a 
spatula in the kitchen, we rely on the local establishments to keep our stomachs full and fingers typing. From Leonardo’s 
to Gator Dawgs and Gyro Plus, we award the West University 
restaurants a thank-goodness-it-isn’t-bathing-suit-weather 
LAUREL for serving up satisfying meals when a half-frozen 
Lean Cuisine doesn’t exactly make the cut. 
That’s all for this week. Excuse us while we dive into our 
fourth platter of rolls and marinara (of the night).I assume everyone realizes why Martin Luther King Jr. 
had a day dedicated to his memory, but I know for cer -
tain this weekend will spark more shouts of, “Sunday 
fun day!” than of the more appropriate, “Where the hell would we be without that guy?”
I’m a white kid, I’m not religious and I grew up in the 
1990s, not the 1960s.
I don’t know much about Ken Kesey and “Furthur”; 
the only Magic School Bus I know about was driven by a cartoon rendition of Kathy Griffin named Ms. Frizzle.
I know about Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Kosovo. 
All I know about Vietnam I learned from history class and Forrest Gump.
Overlooking a life lost 30 years ago is more convenient 
than somberly remembering the deeds of a national hero two generations removed. Convenience cannot lead to for -
getfulness.
Where would the United States be today if King had not 
brazenly stuck his neck out for the good of his people?
It’s a question no one can answer, but thankfully, no 
one has to.
At some point this weekend, dedicate a fraction of your 
time to recognizing the triumphs of a movement led by the will and the virtue of one man.
King was a black man who campaigned for the  civil 
rights, of all people, not just people of his race.
Civil rights apply to everyone, regardless of skin col-
or. King wanted all people to do the right thing, not just whites.
He favored civil disobedience over the take-by-force 
mentality of Malcolm X. King’s words-over-weapons ap-proach allowed him to gain the favor of white Americans — stamping his signature on the civil rights movement.
His impassioned speeches and peaceful policies gained him the national attention neces-sary to create enough awareness to reinforce his cause.
Consciousness snowballed into 
an avalanche of furious discon-tent that overtook the nation. The nation’s reaction ignited a glori-ous change in government and American society.
Such change garnered by King’s 
efforts (not to discredit the thousands of other faces of the 1960s civil rights movement) was something Americans could believe in.
Sound familiar?There shouldn’t be a person on the UF campus who is 
able to conscientiously ignore the power of King’s voice and the effects of his policies.
President-elect Barack Obama has become the face of 
American politics in the past two years. Would his rise have been possible without the work of King and the rest of the civil rights movement?
If not for King’s leadership back then, would we even 
be able to envision a black president now?
Fortunately, our generation doesn’t have to consider 
these possibilities. Instead, we have been blessed with the opportunity to witness the fruits of King’s labor.
Upon learning of threats made on his life in 1964, King 
responded, “If physical death is the price that I must pay to free my white brothers and sisters from a permanent death of the spirit, then nothing can be more redemptive.”
King struggled for everyone, and his triumph is shared 
by all.

Guest column
There has been a disturbing trend toward 
fluffy, feel-good stories in the main-stream media for some time now. In 
the wake of President-elect Barack Obama’s thrilling victory in the general election, this 
trend became even more pronounced than 
usual. 
The new president is going to have more 
on his plate on his first day in office than any commander in chief in recent memory — there are two wars and an economic cri-sis that is being compared to another Great Depression. 
Obama is building a team dedicated to 
change and I, in the flush of his victory , was eager to keep up with the news reports on what he was doing. Then, one day, it started. And my faith in mainstream news plummet-ed as sharply as the stock market. 
During his acceptance speech, Obama had 
promised his daughters, Sasha and Malia, that he would get them a new puppy to join them in their new home. What transpired could 
be described as nothing less than the media 
pouncing on the story with extreme ferocity . 
News articles flooded onto Google, bring-
ing with them the questions deemed worth reporting. What breed of dog will it be? Will it be a rescue dog or will it come from a breeder? Malia is allergic — this means the dog has to be hypoallergenic!
Somewhere, Edward 
R. Murrow needed a drink. 
CNN even went so far as to run a poll 
where the readers could take their pick about what sort of dog the president-elect should choose. This happened during a time in which Obama appointed his former nemesis Sen. Hillary Clinton to the secretary of state post, the recession worsened and Illinois Gov . Rod Blagojevich gave America a dose of Chicago politics in his bid to sell Obama’s Senate seat. 
Then — miraculously — the story faded 
into the background, even if it wasn’t entirely forgotten. I was able to breathe again. Surely such media lunacy was an anomaly. 
Sadly, with a suddenness of the Pokemon 
craze, a new wave was upon us. The cover -
age of Sasha and Malia Obama’s adventures in academics began. The questions took a fa-miliar tone. Which school will the girls be sent 
to? What kind of security detail will they get?
There was even my favorite report on a 
most vital matter: the complete school lunch 
menu that the girls will choose from! 
Will it be tacos or mystery meat?And so I’m reliving a nightmare. I find myself breaking into tears whenever I think of H.L. Mencken — even a sensationalist “re-porter” like Geraldo Rivera would offer better coverage than what’s been out there recently. 
Don’t misunderstand. Fluff stories are not 
necessarily harmful, and it isn’t as if no atten-tion is being paid to the more important news items that I’ve mentioned. But with so much of importance going on, how can a moment be spared to worry about the First Dog or school lunches? 
The mainstream media are suffering from 
a credibility gap these days. They have not, in my view, earned forgiveness for the softball 
questions they lobbed at Bush for eight years 
or the laissez-faire attitude they took toward the “intelligence” that was used as the basis for invading Iraq. 
This is, as so many politicians have been 
heard arguing lately , an important time in American history . 
Simply put, soft news coverage isn’t going 
to cut it. The mainstream media need to get 
back to writing news for adults. We should be 
answering all of the soft news questions that have been given ink during these glory days of hack journalism with a question of our own: Who cares?

Speaking OutUnite Party offers nothing new
Jordan Johnson claims that his 
Unite Party “offers students some-
thing different.” Let’s not be fooled 
— the Unite Party is the Gator Party with a stinky new coat of paint.
During Johnson’s tenure alone, 
he and his party have relentlessly tried to squelch the voice of the 
students in Senate, by limiting their 
individual speaking privileges dur -
ing public debate and authoring 
numerous pieces of legislation that 
would neuter minority rights.
Even though 84 percent of UF 
students voted against hand scan-ners in last fall’s elections, Johnson and his party fully support plans 
that would subject you to a bio-metric scan before you can enter a 
RecSports facility . 
Jordan Johnson is a pretty face 
of SG, but don’t let his charm and good looks fool you.  He’s still Gator Party.

 PLANE STRUCK A FLOCK OF BIRDS 
JUST AFTER TAKEOFF.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK (AP) — A cool-headed pi-
lot maneuvered his crippled jetliner over 
New York City and ditched it in the frigid 
Hudson River on Thursday, and all 155 on 
board were pulled to safety as the plane slowly sank. It was, the governor said, “a miracle on the Hudson.”
One victim suffered two broken legs, a 
paramedic said, but there were no other re-ports of serious injuries.
US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320 
bound for Charlotte, N.C., struck a flock of 
birds just after takeoff minutes earlier at 
LaGuardia Airport, apparently disabling the engines.The pilot, identified as Chesley B. 
“Sully” Sullenberger III of Danville, Calif., 
“was phenomenal,” passenger Joe Hart 
said. “He landed it — I tell you what, the impact wasn’t a whole lot more than a rear-end (collision). It threw you into the seat 
ahead of you.
“Both engines cut out and he actually 
floated it into the river,” he said.
In a city still wounded from the aerial at-
tack on the World Trade Center, authorities were quick to assure the public that terror -
ism wasn’t involved.
The plane was submerged up to its win-
dows in the river by the time rescuers ar -
rived, including Coast Guard vessels and 
commuter ferries that happened to be near -
by. Some passengers waded in water up to their knees, standing on the wing of the plane and waiting for help.
Helen Rodriguez, a paramedic who was among the first to arrive at the scene, said she saw one woman with two broken legs. 
Fire officials said others were evaluated for 
hypothermia, bruises and other minor inju-ries. An infant was on board and appeared to be fine, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.
“We had a miracle on 34th Street. I be-
lieve now we have had a miracle on the Hudson,” Gov. David Paterson said.
The crash took place on a 
20-degree day, one of the coldest of the sea-son in New York. The Coast Guard said the water temperature was 36 degrees.
Dave Sanderson, who was flying home 
to Charlotte after a business trip, said the sound of an explosion was followed by pas-sengers running up the aisle and people be-ing shoved out of the way.
As the plane descended, passenger 
Vallie Collins tapped out a text message to her husband, Steve: “My plane is crash-ing.” He was desperately trying to figure 
out whether she had been on the downed 
plane when the message arrived.
Another passenger, Jeff Kolodjay, said 
people put their heads in their laps and 
prayed.
He said the captain instructed them 
to “brace for impact because we’re going 
down.”
“It was intense. It was intense. You’ve 
got to give it to the pilot. He made a hell of a landing,” Kolodjay said.
Witnesses said the pilot appeared to 
guide the plane down. Barbara Sambriski, a 
researcher at The Associated Press, watched 
the water landing from the news organiza-tion’s high-rise office. “I just thought, ‘Why is it so low?’ And, splash, it hit the water,” she said. Pilot ditches plane into frigid Hudson river; all survive

UF’s Century Tower, which houses a 61-bell carillon, will begin 
celebrating its 30-year anniversary on Sunday.
Century Tower Carillon turns 30
By CAROLYN TILLO

A bright idea proposed by Gainesville Regional Utilities 
will cut the cost of solar power in Gainesville.
The new solar photovoltaic electric feed-in-tariff pro-
gram, which had its first reading at the Gainesville City 
Commission meeting Thursday, will allow GRU customers to sell back all of the solar power they produce to GRU, said Rachel Meek, the solar program manager.
Customers with the photovoltaic systems used to pro-
duce solar power will get a monthly or quar -
terly check from GRU for the energy their sys-tems produce, Meek said. 
The program will launch March 1.GRU’s current program only pays custom-
ers for the excess power they produce that is not used  by their homes and businesses, she said.
The steady income promised by the new program, the na-
tion’s first to be offered by a utility company, will make it 
easier for customers to get loans to cover the upfront costs of 
their photovoltaic systems, Meek said.
Meek said part of the problem with solar power is that 
middle America cannot afford it because it is too expensive.
With this program that pays customers for all the solar 
power they produce, that will change.
Solar electric companies seem to like this plan, and 
Meek said she predicts a solar electric company boom in Gainesville.
UF is also considering the program for the off-campus 
buildings where GRU provides utilities, said John Lawson, the interview coordinator for UF’s Physical Plant Division.
Despite the interest in the feed-in-tariff program, being 
the first utility company in the nation to launch it is not easy.
“We’re handling the growing pains,” Meek said.Tariff rewards

NewsLocal A CELEBRATORY RECITAL 
WILL BE HELD ON SUNDAY.
The sweet sounds of the Century 
Tower Carillon are turning 30 and will ring for an hour out of each month in 2009 to celebrate.
UF boasts one of the largest carillons 
in the nation and one of only four caril-lons in the state, according to Stephanie Smith, graduate assistant at the UF Carillon Studio.
“It’s another thing we have that FSU 
doesn’t have,” Smith said.
The cast-bell carillon inside the tow-
er is a musical instrument made up of 61 finely tuned bells with a five-octave range and is played using a combina-tion of foot pedals and hanging batons, according to the UF Carillon at Century Tower Web site.
The tower rings at every quarter of 
the hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., helping students stay on time, and plays  a dis-tinctive song at the hour, according to the site. 
On Sunday at 3 p.m., Century 
Tower will begin honoring its 30th year of making music with a recital by Dr. Laura Ellis, professional carillonneur and professor of organ, harpsichord and carillon. 
Children and families, as well as stu-
dents, are encouraged to come to the re-cital, Smith said.
“People can bring Frisbees or make 
a picnic out of it,” she said. “It’s going to be fine music, and you don’t have to worry about making noise.”

 SHE HELPS STUDENTS 
WITH DISABILITIES.
By MELISSA MILCHMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
A Santa Fe College student was 
named School V olunteer of the Year 
for Alachua County Public Schools. 
Marci Quested, a 21-year-old elementary education major, has volunteered with special education students at Rawlings Elementary School for two years. 
Quested relates to the students 
she works with because she was born with visual and neurological 
impairments. 
She shares her challenges with 
the students at Rawlings Elementary 
to help them realize that they can do anything they put their minds to, she said.
Every year, Alachua County 
Public Schools name Volunteer of 
the Year in three cate-gories: one youth, one adult and one senior.
Liz Stark, volun-
teer coordinator for Alachua County Public Schools, said Quested was chosen as the youth V olunteer of the Year because of her exceptional ef-forts.
Students usually volunteer as 
a requirement, but Quested does it because she wants to help, Stark said.
Quested is excited to get expe-
rience with special education stu-dents because she wants to work with them as a career.
“It makes them feel great to get a high-five for a good grade, and it makes me feel proud to that I had a hand in helping them,” she said.
Quested said she believes that 
the most important thing she does to help these students is to look past their disabilities to see them for who 
they really are.
“I look above and beyond their 
challenges,” she said. “They are just 
kids.”

However, due to criticism that UF did not 
give faculty enough time to discuss the last round of cuts, Machen said he wants to start the discussion earlier this time.
Instead of starting in March, UF will start 
this week and hopes to make the final pro-posals public by mid-to-late March.
At that point, the UF community will have 
30 to 45 days to discuss the proposed cuts before final recommendations will be made by administrators to UF’s Board of Trustees, which will cast the final vote.
Unlike last time, Machen said cuts will 
be more strategic, instead of even across-the-
board cuts.
Machen also said this round of cuts will 
likely be more difficult. While most of the po-
sitions that were eliminated last time were al-ready vacant, there are fewer vacant positions now, he said, which might translate to more employees being laid off.
Over 400 positions were eliminated, but 
only eight faculty and 65 staff members 
were laid off after the last round of cuts, 
said Interim Vice President for UF’s Human Resource Services Paula Fussell.
On the other hand, Machen delivered 
some good news during the meeting when he said UF is no longer expecting a mid-year budget cut from lawmakers, who finished their special session Wednesday without making further cuts to universities.
Also, if lawmakers pass Gov . Charlie 
Crist’s differential tuition plan this year, it could offset about $24 million of the cuts.
Crist’s plan would allow state universities 
to raise tuition by 15 percent a year until they 
reach the national average.
UF has the ability to raise tuition by that 
much, but it only applies to students who en-
roll in Fall of 2008 or later. 
Regardless of whether Crist’s proposal 
passes, UF will probably hike tuition the full 15 percent next academic year, Machen said. 
To demonstrate his desire for increased 
transparency this time, Machen sent an e-mail Thursday afternoon to UF students, fac-ulty and staff explaining the situation.
But not everyone is smitten with the idea 
of increased transparency . James Klausner, a UF professor, said he thinks it might be a better idea to have budget discussions within each college before opening the process to the entire university. He said he’s afraid that col-
leges will start arguing over who is more im-
portant to the university, which will tarnish relationships.
“I’m afraid that rather than having a posi-
tive discussion it could degenerate into an intellectual brawl,” he said.Machen seeks open disclosure

Last year, these establishments repre-
sented 439 of the 766 incidents.
“The problem is not going to go away 
unless we take a more progressive ap-proach,” he said.
The GPD pays a permanent staff of 
five officers $300,000 each year to moni-tor a three-block downtown area, said GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg. 
During busy weekends, the depart-
ment enlists officers for downtown’s Neighborhood Enforcement Initiative and midtown’s Operations Bureau.
Staffing these patrols requires over -
time payment to officers, a sum that in-creases each year as Gainesville grows. 
In 2005, the department staffed the 
area with the five officers. 
In 2006, the city added overtime offi-
cers for an additional cost of $22,000. The next year, in 2007, overtime went up to $75,000.
In 2008, overtime and staff cost the 
city nearly half a million dollars, a sum that only applies to downtown patrols—not midtown.
Considering that GPD’s budget only 
allots $30 million for staff and services, a disproportionate amount is spent on pa-trols to monitor bars and clubs, Kameg said.
“Something’s got to give,” he said. 
“No one is stepping up to the plate to help fund the services we’re giving.”
Gainesville residents told commis-
sioners that the ordinance would hurt more than it would help. A dozen oppo-
nents protested out-
side the meeting.
UF Student 
Government External Affairs Director Matt Goldberger spoke on behalf of Student 
Body President Kevin 
Reilly and said the or -
dinance would have 
negative effects like an increased market for fake IDs and more unregulated house parties with underage drinking. 
Robert Zeller, a co-owner of Grog 
House, XS, the Copper Monkey and Gator City said the ordinance would vio-
late his property rights and due process 
to fight a prohibition. He also said the ordinance doesn’t protect owners from fake ID users who try to fraudulently enter a bar.
“I’m getting demonized by this city,” 
Zeller said.Bar owners oppose ordinance

Mann said. Grapski will go to trial for the felo-
nies in the next two months.
About a week later, Kiester went to the 
State Attorney’s office to explain what hap-pened before the arrest.
He told Attorney David Margolis that 
Grapski was knocking on the door asking to come in after Kiester had told him to leave. After breaking the glass, he entered the kitch-en through a side door and asked Kiester to help him find his glasses, the GPD arrest re-port stated.
On Dec. 16, Kiester e-mailed the State 
Attorney’s office asking for charges against Grapski to be dropped. He told the court that when he first spoke to Margolis he was still 
shaken and not thinking 
clearly.
Kiester had previously 
told the State Attorney’s 
office that Grapski was fol-lowing him around the house shouting at him. But at the trial, Kiester said Grapski was  kindly asking for his glasses.
Kiester added that he thinks Grapski unin-
tentionally broke the window.
Grapski’s defense attorney, Stephen 
Bernstein, asked Kiester if he had spoken to anyone that may have influenced his decision to drop the charges, and Kiester said he hadn’t been influenced.
Despite Kiester’s request, the State 
Attorney’s office had believed that  Kiester was pressured into the decision and refused, Mann said.
Grapski pled no contest to disorderly con-
duct.  Judge Thomas Jaworski found him guilty of that charge, reinstated bond  and sen-tenced him to six months probation, during which he cannot drink or come in contact with Kiester, Mann said.
Both misdemeanor charges were dropped 
and Grapski was told he would be let out of jail later that evening.
Because he was in jail for three months, 
there will be three months taken off his proba-tion time.

UF quarterback Tim Tebow lifts wide receiver Percy Harvin to celebrate a touchdown during the BCS National Cham-

There’s good news and there’s bad news.
The good news: UF junior middle linebacker Brandon 
Spikes announced his decision to stay in Gainesville for his senior season Thursday.
The bad: UF junior wide receiver Percy Harvin is making 
the jump to the NFL.
Harvin, who was responsible for a team-high 17 touch-
downs and 40 catches this season, said his main goal at UF 
was winning championships, something he did twice in his 
three years in orange and blue.
“When it is all said and done, I wanted to win,” Harvin 
said in a statement. 
“I wanted to be a part of championship teams. We did 
that at Florida.”
Harvin is No. 24 on Scout Inc.’s list of the Top 32 draft 
prospects and is the third wide receiver behind Texas Tech’s Michael Crabtree and Missouri’s Jeremy Maclin.
Spikes will enter the 2009 season as one of the top line-
backers in the country, and he said his decision was a tough 
one.
“I just felt like it was the right choice to come back,” 
Spikes said in a statement. “I love the coaching staff and my teammates, and I look forward to playing another year in 
front of the best fans in America.”Harvin heads to NFL; Spikes returning for senior year

After losing its first game of the 
season on Nov. 14, UF answered with 
a win over Jacksonville to begin a 15-game winning streak.
Coming off a loss for just the sec-
ond time, the No. 19 Gators (16-2, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) responded in similar fashion at South Carolina (8-8, 0-3 SEC) on Thursday night by claiming a 77-63 victory.
While a long winning streak like 
the first is not likely to happen again this season, getting a gritty road win following the loss to Auburn on Sunday was satisfying enough for UF coach Amanda Butler.
“Any road win in the SEC counts 
double, but especial-ly with a team that plays as tough and physical as South Carolina does,” Butler said.
The Gators bat-
tled back from down 
7 early to take a 35-25 lead into half-time.

The young UF frontcourt showed flashes 
of its potential against Auburn on Wednesday. 
Saturday , the Gators will be face to face with talent realized.
When they take the court against Arkansas 
in the O’Connell Center at 2 p.m., Alex Tyus and company will get a firsthand look at the best the Southeastern Conference has to offer.
Razorbacks big man Michael Washington 
is averaging 17.1 points and 10.5 rebounds per game and is the only player in the SEC averag-ing a double-double.
“Michael Washington right now, I think, 
just based on this point in time of the season, 
has got to be a guy that you would consider 
for player of the year in the league,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “We’ve got to be very, very concerned.”For a UF team (15-2, 2-0 SEC) that has strug-
gled to stand strong in the paint this season, containing the platoon of athletic Arkansas (12-3, 0-2 SEC) post players will be a tough task.
The Razorbacks complement Washington 
with 6-foot-8 forward Michael Sanchez.
“I think if we’re small 
like that, we’ve got to hit 
them first. Hit ‘em in the 
legs, box ‘em out and get the rebound. … I think we got to hit ‘em first,” UF point guard Nick Calathes said.
Arkansas will also throw 
out 6-foot-6, 220 pound former NFL wide receiver 
Marcus Monk. As a freshman, Monk played 
sparingly on the basketball team but starred 
on the football field, setting an SEC freshman record with 37 receptions. 
Monk had a breakout season as a junior Hogs led by strong front line“When it is all said and done, I wanted to win. 
I wanted to be a part of championship teams. 
We did that at Florida.”

Your first sultry kiss of another’s lips 
gives you goosebumps. It’s exciting, 
nerve-wracking, but still an experience 
unlike any other. It’s more memorable than 
that third one for sure, even if that third time around you were much better at the art of lip smacking. 
There wasn’t much national historical 
significance about UF’s ’96 national title, the football program’s first championship. They were a great team led by a Heisman-winning quarterback in Danny Wuerffel. That’s hap-pened many times before.
However, when Tim Tebow approached 
the podium and made a promise, he left an imprint on college football history . 
This championship, that speech, will be 
remembered as one of the most remarkable moments in college football history.
But it’s not the best championship in 
UF history. That’s still 12 years ago, when Wuerffel was throwing lasers to Jacquez Green and Reidel Anthony , while Lawrence 
Wright was knocking the poop out of oppo-
nents’ receivers. 
If there was no ’96 title, there is no ’08 title. 
The first is still best, and it should always be that way . That’s what my somewhat esteemed colleague Phil on the Hill has missed.These two teams 
took similar paths. 
They had disap-
pointing bowl losses  
the year  before and then, the following year, had a group of leaders come to-
gether who swore 
that wouldn’t hap-pen again. It didn’t — for either team. 
They had stretches were they were as domi-nant as a football team can be. 
Wuerffel and his gang did something that 
hadn’t been done here before, and that de-serves brownie points. Greatness was expect-ed in 2008 in large part because of what hap-pened in 1996. Have you ever seen a movie where the sequel is significantly better than the first one? There aren’t too many. Sequels are made because the first was successful. 
When the history of UF football is talked 
about in 20 years, the conversation still starts with Wuerffel, Steve Spurrier and 1996. It leads into Tebow, Urban Meyer and 2008. 
This is just another chapter in what’s be-
coming a great novel. But you don’t get to the middle unless you read the introduction.Which Gators national championship football team reigns supreme?
It is easy to overvalue the present and im-mediately believe what you just saw is 
better than the previous “best.”  The trap 
always looms. So going into this debate, I 
took special notice to steel myself against the norm.
I still believe the 2008 team is the best of 
UF’s national champions. You likely came 
to the same conclusion after Wednesday’s 
“Who’s the Best?” graphic.
Let’s take a look at the statistics.Offensively , the teams are a wash. Tim 
Tebow, Percy Harvin and the weapons of this year are pretty much comparable to Danny Wuerffel, Fred Taylor and friends. While ’96 did average slightly more points per game (47 to 43.6), this can be attributed to the new clock rules this year. Both offenses averaged the same number of yards per play (7.1).
The special teams certainly wasn’t too 
shabby this season, as punt returner Brandon James was a force early in the season. With opponents keying on James, punt and field-
goal blocks became an every-game affair. The 
2008 outfit blocked nine kicks, tying 1995 for the school record.
But when it comes to defense, ’96 is no 
match for ’08. This year’s squad allowed few-er points (12.9 versus 17), set a school record for interceptions (26), and the start-
ers allowed only six 
touchdowns dur -
ing the last eight games. Brandon Spikes and compa-ny held Oklahoma, 
the highest-scoring 
team in NCAA his-tory, to 14 points. And this year’s 
squad was much younger, with not a single senior starter and only three upperclassmen total, compared to four seniors on the ’96 de-fense.
The 2008 Gators became the first team in 
Southeastern Conference history to win six league games by 28 points or more.
Add on Tebow, probably the best player 
in college football history, and his promise af-ter the Mississippi loss, and 2008 simply be-comes storybook. What you may not realize 
is that even in a year where Tebow had to do 
less, he still had one more total touchdown (42 to 41) than Wuerffel. 
So for once, don’t worry, UF fans. You’re 
not just trapped in the moment — this one re-ally can be considered the best of the best.

stop the Gators from setting the high-est score (196.50) in the country this year and earning the No. 1 ranking.
“The whole team proved them-
selves at the first meet,” senior Corey Hartung said. “If that was the first meet and we did that well, then I know we can do so much better, and 
we will do so much better.”
UF will get its chance to do even 
better tonight in its second consecu-
tive home meet against No. 4 Auburn at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center to begin Southeastern Conference play. The Tigers won their first meet hand-ily against Illinois-Chicago but suf-fered a setback against rival Alabama 
on Friday , losing by the narrowest 
margin possible, 0.025.
“Obviously there were some areas 
and some issues, some mistakes that we made, things that we have to iron out and things that (we’ve worked) on this week, such as the lineup po-sitioning and changing a few things with routine composition,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
Faehn reiterated the importance 
of starting strong against Auburn.
“Once again, we have to just get 
the ball rolling on vault,” she said.
Freshman Nicole Ellis, who com-
peted in vault Friday , said she needed to hone her focus against Auburn.
“Last weekend I was more ner -
vous than I think I will be this week-
end just because I know what to expect now,” Ellis said.
The Oklahoma 
meet seemed to rest the worries of the 
team in general, not just freshmen.
“Overall, I guess the biggest feel-
ing I have from last week is I have 
more confidence,” Hartung said. “I 
actually believe in this team.”
She’ll have to feel good if UF 
can put away Auburn like they did Oklahoma.
“I know the SEC is the toughest 
conference,” Hartung said. “If we’re there on Friday, we’ll be great.”ZAISER OUT FOR YEAR: Junior

“I think the league is maybe 
a lot better than what peo-ple thought in November or 
December, because I still think 
there’s a lot of youthfulness in 
our league,” Donovan said.
Freshman Allen Chaney 
missed Wednesday’s game against Auburn with back spasms, but should play against the Razorbacks.
“Any time you’re dealing 
with a back and the discomfort 
he was in, you just always want 
to make sure he gets himself back healthy,” Donovan said.Chaney likely to play against Arkansas
wide open, thanks mostly to South Carolina 
turnovers.
The Gators were fueled by 24 Gamecocks 
turnovers compared to just 14 of their own, and they led by as many as 21 points after the break.
“It was important for us to play good team 
defense tonight because we knew that we had not done that at Auburn,” Butler said.
Marshae Dotson sparked her team with 13 
first-half points. She shot a perfect 8 for 8 from the field and finished with 19 points and six re-bounds.
“Lucky for us, Marshae Dotson had her bat-
tle gear on today, and she came ready to play,” Butler said. “She did a great job on the low block of wanting the ball first and foremost, and that made all the difference in her offen-sive output.”
Sha Brooks continued to struggle from the 
floor early on, shooting just 3 of 14 in the first 
half. Despite what seemed to be a cold shooting 
night for her, the senior guard finished with 25 points on 8-of-21 shooting from the field.
She was also a perfect 9 for 9 from the free-
throw line and threw in nine assists.
UF must now get ready to host Georgia on 
Sunday at 2 p.m.

ily last season, winning two games by 27 and 19 points, respectively.
