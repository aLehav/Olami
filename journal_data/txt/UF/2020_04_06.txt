Farmers are watching their produce rot as they can’t sell it, pg. 3Kaelyn Cassidy

In the bed of a black pickup truck 
sat stacks of boxes, each one with a 
drawing of a panda and an alliga-
tor in surgical masks. The drawing 
read, “United we stand” in English 
and “United to ﬁ  ght together” in 
Chinese. 
The boxes contained N95 masks, 
surgical masks and other supplies 
that nurses and doctors treating CO-
VID-19 are desperate for. 
Standing six feet apart and wear-
ing masks themselves, the donors 
— who were all members of Gaines-
ville’s Chinese community — un-
loaded the boxes ﬁ  lled with person-al protective equipment to donate to 
UF Health Shands Hospital.
Now, as the U.S. leads the world 
in conﬁ  rmed COVID-19 cases and 
hospitals across the nation face a 
critical shortage of personal protec-
tive equipment, many locals have 
tried to solve the problem on their 
own. 
Gainesville’s Chinese American 
community discussed ways they 
could help and decided they would 
use their connections in China to 
raise money and procure equipment 
to donate to Shands. As of Sunday 
evening, there were more than 120 
conﬁ  rmed cases of COVID-19 in 
Alachua County, and at least 30 re-
ported cases of UF students and fac-ulty. Currently, there are nine cases 
being treated at Shands. These 
numbers are likely to rise.
While there’s been a lot of com-
munity support, Abby Andring, an 
employee at UF Health’s supply 
chain services, said they currently 
have enough personal protective 
equipment to meet demands, but 
it’s a struggle to make predictions 
regarding how much they’ll need if 
the situation worsens. 
 “Our main goal of getting this 
community support is to make sure 
that we’re prepared in abundance,” 
Andring said.     
The donation was a culmination 
of weeks of effort involving about 
200 Chinese Americans living in Gainesville, and it all started with a 
group chat.
Created by Gainesville realtor 
Hongtao Liu a few years ago in the 
messaging app WeChat, the group 
is made up of about 500 Chinese 
Americans in Gainesville. Months 
ago, many of them sent surgical 
masks and other personal protec-
tive equipment to their friends and 
family in China to help them protect 
themselves from the COVID-19 out-
break before it reached the United 
States.
A separate group chat in the 
messaging app was created by Liu, 
titled in Chinese, “The Gainesville 
Facemask Donation.”
Members of the group chat got 
the word out to their friends, fam-
ily and community members and 
raised more than $30,000 in three days through direct donations us-
ing services like PayPal, Zelle and 
wire transfers. The school board 
of the Huagen Chinese School in 
Gainesville set up an account to 
handle the money and purchasing, 
said Amy Pan, a UF business pro-
fessor who was involved with the 
donations. 
The money was used to pur-
chase personal protective equip-
ment from China, and they shipped 
it out of the country in small pack-
ages to circumvent Chinese rules 
against exporting medical supplies, 
Pan said. Individuals donated the 
equipment that their friends and 
families in China sent to them.
On Thursday morning, the 
members of the group dropped off 
thousands of masks they collected 
and other equipment, which were 
received by Dr. Marvin Dewar, the 
Gators grieving a season cut short 
The Florida baseball team won 16 games in 
a row to start the season and achieved a No. 
1 ranking. A week later, its season was over,

U.S. ‘wasted’ months before 
preparing for virus pandemic
A review of federal purchasing 
contracts by The Associated 
Press shows federal agencies 
waited until mid-March to begin 
placing bulk orders of N95 
respirator masks, mechanical 
ventilators and other equipment 
needed by front-line health 
care workers in the midst of 
COVID-19. Now, three months 
into the crisis, that stockpile 
is nearly drained just as the 
number of patients needing 
critical care is surging. According 
to the AP, some state and local 
officials report receiving broken 
ventilators and decade-old dry-
rotted masks. On March 27, 
U.S. President Donald Trump 
promised that his administration 
would ensure that 100,000 
additional ventilators would 
be made available “within 
100 days,” and he said on 
Thursday that he’ll use the 
Defense Production Act to order 
Respironics and other ventilator 
makers to step up production.
Ex-NFL kicker, Saints hero Tom 
Dempsey dies at 73
Former NFL kicker Tom 
Dempsey, died late Saturday 
while struggling with 
complications from COVID-19, 
his daughter said. He was 73. 
Dempsey played in the NFL 
despite being born without toes 
on his kicking foot and made a 
record 63-yard field goal. The 
Orleans Parish coroner has yet 
to release a cause of death for 
Dempsey, but he was diagnosed 
with dementia several years ago 
and tested positive for COVID-19 
a little more than a week ago. 
Dempsey’s game-winning field 
goal against Detroit on Nov. 8, 
1970, stood as an NFL record for 
43 years until the Broncos’ Matt 
Prater broke it with a 64-yarder 
in Denver in 2013. Both the shoe 
with which Dempsey kicked the 
63-yarder and the ball are in 
the Saints Hall of Fame in New 
Orleans, into which Dempsey 
was inducted in 1989. U.K. Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson hospitalized with 
COVID-19
British Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson, who was diagnosed 
with COVID-19 more than a week 
ago, was admitted to a hospital 
Sunday for tests. Johnson, 
55, has been quarantined in 
his Downing Street residence 
since being diagnosed with 
COVID-19 on March 26. The 
prime minister’s Downing Street 
office said the hospitalization 
was a “precautionary step” 
and Johnson remains in charge 
of the government. Johnson 
has continued to chair daily 
meetings on Britain’s response 
to the outbreak and has 
released several video messages 
during his 10 days in isolation. 
Johnson’s fiancee, Carrie 
Symonds, 32, revealed Saturday 
that she spent a week in bed with 
COVID-19 symptoms, though 
she wasn’t tested. Symonds, 
who is pregnant, said she was 
now “on the mend.”
Biden raises idea of Democrats 
holding an online convention
Democratic presidential 
candidate Joe Biden said 
Sunday that the Democratic 
National Convention, already 
delayed until August because 
of COVID-19, may need to take 
place online as the pandemic 
continues to reshape the race 
for the White House. Biden has 
been the lead in the number of 
delegates needed to secure the 
party’s presidential nomination 
at a convention in Milwaukee, 
Wisconson, originally scheduled 
for mid-July. Democrats hoped 
an early gathering would give 
the party more time to unify 
around a nominee who could 
defeat Trump in November. 
But officials announced on 
Thursday they were taking 
the unprecedented step of 
postponing the convention 
until August, just before 
the Republican National 
Convention is scheduled. Biden 
publicly endorsed delaying the 
convention before the move to 
do so was announced, and said 
Sunday that the extraordinary measure of holding one all 
online is still not a certainty.
States lack key data on virus 
cases among medical workers
Health officials and experts on 
COVID-19 have recently noted 
the difficulty in testing nurses, 
doctors and other people in the 
health care profession. Health 
officials in Washington state 
have not kept track of how 
many doctors and nurses have 
the disease despite the high 
number of COVID-19 cases 
there. New York, the epicenter 
of the COVID-19 outbreak, 
also lacks infection figures for 
medical staff, according to Jill 
Montag, a spokesperson with 
the New York State Department 
of Health. Washington state had 
more than 7,500 cases, and New 
York had counted more than 
110,000 as of Saturday, and 
neither state knows how many 
of those cases are health care 
workers. The Johns Hopkins 
Center for Health Security has 
recommended hospitals keep 
a log of staff with COVID-19, 
but Dr. Angela Gardner, an 
emergency physician and 
professor at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center, said that some hospitals 
have wished to keep worker 
cases secret for fear that 
revealing them could spread 
panic and affect the hospital 
negatively.
Chaos and scrambling in the U.S 
oil patch as prices plummet
The global economic crisis 
caused by the COVID-19 
pandemic has devastated the 
oil industry in the U.S., which 
pumps more crude oil than 
any other country. The price of 
U.S. crude oil fell harder than 
at any point in history during 
the first quarter, dropping 66 
percent to around $20 a barrel. 
While a drop in oil prices would 
have largely been celebrated in 
the U.S. generations ago, those 
depressed prices carry negative 
economic implications today, 
particularly in states that have 
become dependent on oil to 
keep their budgets balanced 
and residents employed. Crude 
oil prices have recovered some 
ground. However, they traded 
at around $28 a barrel Friday 
after a week in which Trump 
tweeted that he expects Saudi 
Arabia and Russia will end an 
oil war and dramatically cut 
production. Trump met with oil 
executives on Friday but there 
were no announcements, and 
prices remain well below what 
most U.S. producers need to stay 
afloat.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 74

SOME MAY WATCH THEIR CROPS 
ROT IN THE FIELD DUE TO 
LOW SALES 
By Katie Delk
Features Staff Writer
Siembra. That’s the last name Cody Galli-
gan and his partner chose for their son, Naim, 
and four years later for their daughter, Sofi. 
Galligan carefully picked the name, which 
means to grow, to plant and to sow. 
Two years after Naim was born, Galligan 
founded Siembra Farm and named it after his 
son. Now, Naim and Sofi run through the 10-
acre woods and along a creek outside of the 
property.
But through almost 10 years of owning 
Siembra Farm, Galligan has never seen any-
thing like COVID-19.
In Alachua County, the agricultural in-
dustry makes up 17.5 percent of the county’s 
workforce and is the county’s third-largest em-
ployer. More than 50 percent of the total land 
use in the county is also devoted to farming, 
with over 180,000 acres of agricultural land.
According to a UF Institute of Food and 
Agricultural Sciences report, “every dollar of 
sales from agriculture products generates an 
additional $1.80 of business sales in other 
parts of the county’s economy.” 
But some farmers and farmers markets 
have been forced to change the way they op-
erate to cope with COVID-19.
Siembra Farm 
On March 21, Siembra Farm sold produce 
at their last farmers market, Haile Farmers 
Market, located at 5213 SW 91st Terrace.
“We’re making the call to stop attending 
them and switch the gears to continue to pro-
vide the same amount of food to the commu-nity,” Galligan said.
Originally, Siembra Farm was family-run, 
but under the new collective system estab-
lished last summer, the farm sells its produce 
at farmers markets and to restaurants. Now 
that the pandemic limits social gatherings, 
Siembra Farm is returning to selling Commu-
nity Supported Agriculture (CSA). 
The CSAs are packages of eight to 10 sea-
sonal vegetables including carrots, cabbage, 
beets and broccoli for $35 with additional 
costs for shipping to East Gainesville. 
Every Wednesday and Saturday, Siembra 
Farm sells the packages at the Working Food 
Community Center, located at 219 NW 10th 
Avenue, from 9 to 11 a.m. Customers must 
pre-order the package to prevent cash transac-
tions and to limit contact. 
To prevent the spread of COVID-19, Siem-
bra Farm has installed handwashing stations 
and limited the number of people touching 
and harvesting the vegetables. 
“As a farmer, we are providing food to the 
community, and we have an obligation to pro-
vide that in the safest way we can — both with 
how we grow the food and how we wash the 
food and finally how we distribute the food,” 
Galligan said.
With COVID-19 at the forefront of business 
owners’ minds, Galligan hopes that customers 
will continue to value organic food over store-
bought vegetables. He isn’t experiencing any 
income issues right now, but he said he sees 
trouble on its way. 
“It could harm our sales if the economy 
gets tighter, which I’m guessing it will,” he 
said. 
The Family Garden
At The Family Garden, the loss of sales has 
been difficult. Before COVID-19, the farm sold 
produce to restaurants and the Alachua Coun-
ty School Board for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Now, those crops may die in the fields.
“If they don’t buy it and we don’t have 
anybody to sell it to, then it goes bad, so we sit 
there and we watch thousands and thousands 
of dollars just go bad on the field,” owner Jor-
dan Brown said. “We’re just trying to stay in 
business and we’re trying to take payroll, try-
ing not to have to fire anybody, lay anybody 
off, but it’s getting challenging.”
Next week, the planting season at The 
Family Garden ends. As a result, the workers 
cannot alter how the plants are grown.
Despite the losses, people continued to 
pick strawberries Thursday through Satur-
day, bought vegetables from the stands and 
purchased Community Supported Agriculture 
packages. 
The Family Garden is the largest CSA pro-
gram in Gainesville, offering packages of eight 
to 10 items for $35 each week. The packages 
at the farm are memberships and can be pur-
chased on their website.
Roger’s Farm 
Now that farmers markets are closed, some 
of the strawberries on Roger’s Farm are al-
ready rotting, owner Mike Stephens said. 
“We’re not really getting the sales that we 
would normally have,” he said. “I mean, we 
really won’t know the extent of it until the 
end of the season, when everything’s said and 
done and paid for.” 
On the field, the workers are keeping their 
distance from one another, soaking and scrub-
bing the berries for 10 minutes after picking 
and accepting online orders to limit contact, 
Stephens said. 
Stephens empathizes with other farmers 
facing losses. On social media, Stephens said 
he has seen large farms in South Florida that 
are not able to sell anything and that are giv-
ing away produce on the side of the street.To aid the agriculture community, he has 
traveled to farms in South Florida and to farms 
in Tampa and purchased goods like lemons 
and limes to sell at Roger’s Farm.
Right now, Stephens is unsure of how 
much money he will lose. He said that the 
produce will either be sold, donated or go bad.
“There’s going to be a lot of people that 
take some really big hits, especially in agri-
culture,” he said. “(It costs) a lot of money to 
grow it, it cost a lot of money to harvest it, and 
if it’s not going anywhere, that’s basically just 
money thrown out the window.”

Despite significant decreases in the number 
of pickups at the UF Hitchcock Field and Fork 
Pantry, the foodservice continues to operate 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.The pantry, located on UF’s campus 
provides non-perishable food, toiletries and 
fresh produce grown at the Field and Forks 
Gardens to those who present a Gator 1 Card. 
The Hitchcock Field and Fork pantry had more 
than 600 checkouts the week before Spring 
Break. Since UF went fully online on March 
16, it only had 168 checkouts that week.A Friday email sent to students said those 
who use the pantry can place online orders for 
what they need and specify their date and time 
of pickup. Students can also stop by the pantry 
to pick up a premade bag of food. 
Wednesday’s operating time also changed 
to open from 3-6 p.m., said Ambre Hobson, 
the pantry’s supervisor and assistant director in the Dean of Students Office.
Because students are heading home, 
volunteers — including faculty, staff and 
graduate students — are running the pantry.
“We do plan to continue to serve students 
and staff on our campus for as long as we 
can,” Hobson said.

Over the past few weeks, we’ve all made 
sacrifices for the health and safety 
of our families and our community. 
Few have sacrificed more than the 
many small business owners who have 
suspended operations to prevent the 
spread of COVID-19. 
Therefore, we would like to extend this 
special offer of 50% off  to all local 
businesses  who would like to open up a 
new print campaign with us.
We’re all in this together, and we’ll get 
through this together.

For Chinese Americans, there’s a saying: 
you have to ﬁ  ght the whole battle, Pan said.
“We were helping the Chinese people,” 
Pan said. “Now, we are helping American 
hospitals.”
Jingkai Wu, an exchange student and sec-
ond-year mechanical engineering master’s 
student at UF, got involved in the donation 
effort because he said he thinks every indi-
vidual can make a difference in ﬁ  ghting this 
global issue. He said Chinese students have 
more information and experience in the mat-
ter because their families have been going 
through it since the beginning of the year. 
He personally donated 10 medical overalls 
and 25 pairs of shoe covers.
 “Helping local hospitals is helping our-
selves,” Wu said. “The more resources and 
supports they get, the safer our community would be.”
 Dr. Xiuli Liu, a pathologist at Shands, 
said part of why she helped the group with 
the effort was to show her kids the impor-
tance of community and how to help when 
there’s a crisis.
 Both Pan and Liu hope that other organi-
zations in need will reach out to them if they 
are in need. 
 People who are interested in further 
contributing to the fundraising efforts can 
do so through a Google Form at iﬂ  a.news/
donations. The form indicates that the group 
is looking to make donations to other local 
hospitals, public service employees and law 
enforcement ofﬁ  cers.  
 Meanwhile, UF professor Jian Ge was or-
ganizing his own donation effort. 
 The astronomy professor, who has been 
in the news before for his role in ﬁ  nding the 
planet Vulcan, organized more than 300 do-
nors to purchase personal protective equip-
ment for medical staff in China a few months 
ago. As cases rose in the U.S., those he helped then contacted him to ﬁ  nd out how 
they could help Americans now. 
 Ge said close to 200 people from all over 
China, some of whom he has never met, 
contacted him so they could donate personal 
protective equipment, which he collected 
and donated to Shands as well as the UF de-
partments of ophthalmology, which studies 
and treats eye disorders, and otolaryngology, 
which deals with the surgical and medical 
treatment of conditions of the ear, nose and 
throat. 
 He said he knows of a second grader 
in China named Michael who donated the 
money he received from his relatives during 
the Chinese Spring Festival to buy masks to 
donate to the U.S.
 Through these donations, he has re-
ceived about 2,000 N95 masks, 4,000 surgi-
cal masks and 2,000 medical masks. He said 
he hopes other hospitals in need reach out 
to him so he can organize more donations. 
 “Nobody can survive without the global 
help for each other,” Ge said.

LOCAL ARTISTS AND 
SUPPORTERS FIGHT FOR THE 
MUSIC INDUSTRY 
AMID COVID-19
Chloe Greenberg
Avenue Staff Writer
Leaving many without work and even 
more with uncertainty, the COVID-19 out-
break has shifted the way the Gainesville 
music industry functions. 
Facing a live-performance drought, lo-
cal artists are relying on fan support from 
a distance. 
Through tuning in to livestreams, in-
teracting with artists online and streaming 
music, fans can help support the industry 
on both a local and global scale.
Alyssa Stark, a 21-year-old UF gradu-
ate student and the co-president of Swamp 
Records, said one of the most important 
things listeners can do is just that — con-
tinue to listen.
“Deﬁ  nitely, the biggest thing is stream-
ing music,” Stark said. “Because without 
tickets and touring, which no small bands 
can do right now, streaming music is their 
only source of income.”
The student-run record label at UF has 
had to endure a “trial and error adaptation 
process” to support its artists and their vir-
tual endeavors, she said. 
Stark said adding artists’ songs to playl-
ists on music streaming services is another 
little-known way to help smaller artists get the exposure they would typically garner 
through playing live shows. 
“I hope to not see the bands lose the 
momentum that they have,” Stark said. “I 
hope that they can grow that momentum 
because it’s hard to do that without live 
shows. Hopefully these livestreams and 
virtual events will allow the bands to keep 
gaining that traction.”
Driveaway, a band signed to Swamp 
Records, is refusing to let its music go un-
heard and its sense of humor go unnoticed. 
The band hosted a concert over Zoom on 
March 28. 
“We could just see everyone sitting 
down in their living rooms on the monitors 
watching us, which is really relaxing,” said 
vocalist Trenton Ropp. 
While not every artist is doing live re-
mote shows, bassist Tanner Ropp said that 
continuing to provide support through so-
cial media and streaming music can help 
facilitate an artist’s growth.
“Whatever the artist is putting in work to 
do, just always try to be involved in that,” 
the bassist said. “I think the only thing we 
really can do is be engaged on social media. 
That’s always important, because the more 
people that are engaging, the more others 
are going to see that and the more the audi-
ence will spread that way.”
Now joining the ﬁ  ght is MusicGNV, a 
nonproﬁ  t stepping up to support Gaines-
ville’s independent music scene. Co-found-
er Brandon Telg said he and his team were 
planning on introducing MusicGNV as a 
live show and production organization for local artists, but COVID-19 changed their 
plans. 
“What we’re setting ourselves up as 
immediately is essentially a charity,” Telg 
said. “If you donate to us through our web-
site and note the artist that you’d like your 
donation to go to, your donation will be 
tax-deductible, and the full amount that 
you are donating will be given to that art-
ist.”
MusicGNV is continuing to post pre-re-
corded artist performances to drum up sup-
port from the community as well as pro-vide a connection among artists and their 
fans. 
“For us, it’s not just about putting on 
great shows,” Telg said. “It’s been about 
really helping to build up the music com-
munity in ways that we are able, and we 
have skills and abilities to do.”

Alligator Staff Writer
“Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, 
and Madness” is the Netﬂ  ix series 
that took the world by storm when 
it was released on March 20. The 
so-strange-it-can-only-be-true story 
is perfect fodder for a generation of 
meme creators and internet-savvy 
streamers. 
Filmmakers Eric Goode and Re-
becca Chaiklin illustrate that the sev-
en-episode docu-series is about much 
more than big cats by the end of the 
ﬁ  rst episode. “Tiger King” is about 
ego, money, cults, queer loneliness, 
a hit and an unsolved disappearance. 
At its most profound, “Tiger King” 
is a portrait of a world that’s both 
completely foreign and an eerily ac-
curate reﬂ  ection of the United States. 
It’s strange, hilarious, frustrating and 
pretty sad. The main character, Joe Maldo-
nado- Passage — better known as Joe 
Exotic — is a gay, gun-toting, big cat 
enthusiast who is equal parts show-
man and conman. Much of the docu-
mentary’s strength lies in Exotic’s odd 
charm as he boasts about his fame, 
husbands and cats.
Many documentaries rely heav-
ily on talking-head interviews, which 
can easily grow stale, but the inter-
views in “Tiger King” are entertaining 
character studies in their own right. 
The series’ main asset is its wealth 
of on-location footage from Exotic’s 
animal park in Oklahoma, and simi-
lar parks elsewhere in the country, 
including Tampa.
The ﬁ  lmmakers had seemingly 
unlimited access to these scattered 
ecosystems over several years, suc-
cessfully carving this mountain of 
information into entertaining televi-
sion. “Tiger King” frequently jumps between different points in time, a 
carefully assembled mosaic with a fo-
cus on impactful moments and subtle 
revelations.
The series could spend more time 
on the animal rights issues at play, 
but it chooses to use that argument as 
the backdrop for a human conﬂ  ict in-
stead: a war of words among animal 
sanctuary owners. The animals aren’t 
forgotten by any means, but the fact 
that their plight doesn’t take center 
stage is the point. As “Tiger King” 
shows, the lives of these animals are 
afterthoughts for Exotic and the other 
big cat lovers — just props meant to 
highlight their owners’ uniqueness.
That said, it’s a sign of the series 
insight and thoughtful construction 
that, by the end, viewers feel bad for 
everyone caught in Exotic’s orbit — 
including Exotic himself. “Tiger King” 
is not an uplifting narrative to gather 
around as we sink further into the gloom of isolation, but it’s well worth 
a watch. It’s a tale of caged things that 
is, if nothing else, entertaining.
In the weeks following the release 
of “Tiger King,” it has been hard to 
avoid. The series has taken over pop-
ular meme accounts and news outlets 
like The New York Times and The 
Washington Post. The aftermath of 
“Tiger King” may be just as entertain-
ing and revealing as the docu-series 
itself.
Big Cat Rescue founder Carole 
Baskin, Exotic’s arch-nemesis, is a 
main character in the series and a per-
son of interest in the disappearance 
of her former husband, Jack Donald 
Lewis, a Florida millionaire who van-
ished in 1997.
A Hillsborough County investiga-
tion has reopened due to the renewed 
interest in the case.
Sheriff Chad Chronister requested 
tips associated with the case March 
30 via Twitter.
“Since @Netﬂ  ix and #Covid19 
#quarantine has made #TigerKing all the rage, I ﬁ  gured it was a good time 
to ask for new leads,” he wrote.
The series ends with Exotic being 
sentenced to 22 years for falsifying 
wildlife records, violating the Endan-
gered Species Act by killing ﬁ  ve tiger 
cubs and federal charges for a 2017 
murder-for-hire scheme targeting 
Baskin.
The past few weeks have been 
ﬁ  lled with COVID-19 and “Tiger 
King” news. The most recent news 
encapsulates it all — Exotic has been 
transferred from coronavirus isolation 
to a prison medical center, according 
to the New York Post. 
With its all-encompassing com-
ponents, the only logical thing to do 
while you’re in isolation is to watch 
“Tiger King.” According to a video 
posted on Twitter Saturday by Jeff 
Lowe, a former Joe Exotic business 
partner, fans will be treated to anoth-
er episode, tentatively scheduled for 
release next week. 
“Netﬂ  ix is adding one more epi-
sode that will be on next week,” Lowe 
said, “we’re ﬁ  lming here tomorrow.”

DRASTIC TURNAROUND 
ON THE MOUND
By Joseph Salvador, 
Before anyone took the mound in 2020 for 
the Florida Gators, junior pitcher Jack Left-
wich made it clear that this year, things were 
going to be different.
“I think everyone’s kind of pissed off 
about last year on the pitching end, because 
the hitters did really good, but it was kind 
of on our shoulders,” he said at preseason 
media availability in January.
The Orlando native referenced UF’s cu-
mulative 5.37 ERA — second-to-last in the 
SEC in 2019 — as reason for that anger. Flor-
ida’s poor pitching contributed to its 34-26 
record — the first time UF hadn’t won 40 
games since 2013.
That anger and embarrassment carried 
over into the shortened 2020 season, where 
you’d need a world-class detective to find 
a weakness on this team. The Gators were 
the No. 1 team in the country before the CO-
VID-19 pandemic ended their season prema-
turely.
Despite the heartbreaking circumstances, 
Leftwich and the rest of the team had some 
fun with the timing of the outbreak.
“Some of us joked we wish this would’ve happened last year,” Leftwich said. “That’s 
not just how life works out. It is what it is.”
UF’s 2.41 ERA this year ranked fifth in the 
SEC and 16th nationally. And it began with 
Leftwich and junior Tommy Mace.
The two junior right-handers started on 
Fridays and Saturdays for UF this season and 
were seen as leaders on the team.
Their experience was an invaluable asset 
that the Gators lacked last year, according to 
both pitchers.
Mace, who had a 1.67 ERA and a 3-0 
record, says that he was not surprised at 
all with how the pitching staff drastically 
improved this season. When asked what 
helped the pitchers bounce back, his answer 
revolved around the mental aspect of the 
game.
“Being uncomfortable while we’re prac-
ticing because you’re going to be uncom-
fortable during a game,” Mace said. “When 
you have to battle through adversity, that’s 
where you tell what kind of player you are.”
Mace and Leftwich also raved about the 
bullpen’s emergence and specifically named 
sophomore Ben Specht.
“He was like a bulldog out there,” Left-
wich said.
Specht — a reliable closer who led the 
team with three saves — had a 0.75 ERA 
that contributed to the bullpen’s 1.76 mark through its 17 games.
Other hurlers who had a hand in handi-
capping hitters were freshman Tyler Nesbitt 
(0.00), sophomore Christian Scott (1.20) and 
freshman Hunter Barco (1.40) who com-
bined for 46 innings pitched.
Florida’s pitching staff truly rebounded on the mound in its limited action this year, 
but it will never know what could have been 
if given a full season.
