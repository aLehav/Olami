Gun advocacy group Florida Carry took 
aim at another Florida state school Monday.
This time, Eastern Florida State College 
is facing legal action after it released a state-
ment concerning a shooting on the college’s Palm Bay campus last week.UF, the subject of another lawsuit from 
Florida Carry, ﬁ  led a motion to dismiss the group’s suit against the university’s ban of ﬁ  rearms on campus Friday.
The news release stated EFSC would be 
maintaining its ban on storing ﬁ  rearms in vehicles on campus, despite some Florida universities redacting their policies after Florida’s First District Court of Appeal ruled against the University of North Florida on the 
issue.
The college was awaiting a ﬁ  nal ruling 
by the court before changing its policy, but 
Florida Carry’s Sean Caranna said the court 
has already made a decision.Caranna said the only thing left unsettled 
in the case are attorney fees, which means the 
court’s opinion is already in effect. The court ruled in December 2013 that bans against 
storing ﬁ  rearms in vehicles on state campus-
es are unlawful.
However, EFSC spokesman John Glisch 
said the college was in the process of chang-ing its policy before Florida Carry ﬁ  led the 
suit.

Sophomore outﬁ  elder Harrison Bader 
has been suspended indeﬁ  nitely from team 
activities due to a scooter accident early Sunday in which Gainesville Police is in-vestigating whether alcohol was involved.
Bader crashed his scooter while driving 
southbound on Southwest 10th Street when he struck a curb and collided into a parked Ford F-150 in the 300 block, GPD spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
An ofﬁ  cer arrived at the scene and found 
the outﬁ  elder lying beside his scooter unre-sponsive, Tobias said. 
Ofﬁ  cers smelled a “strong odor of alco-
hol” coming from Bader, who was taken to Shands with non-life-threatening injuries.
Investigators are awaiting the results of 
a blood alcohol content test to determine whether to ﬁ  le charges, Tobias said. 
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan announced the 
suspension in a statement on Tuesday.
As a freshman, Bader 
led Florida with a .312 batting average. 
He started 57 games, 
including 35 in left ﬁ  eld. He tied Justin Shafer for 
the team lead with 69 hits 
and ﬁ  nished second with 
37 runs scored.
His absence now 
leaves a void in the middle of Florida’s lineup and its starting outﬁ  eld. The Gators now only have three other players listed as outﬁ  elders.

Taco-themed nicknames will 
not appear on the Spring Stu-
dent Government ballot, and the Taco Libre Party that slated candidates with the names will 
get a public warning for trying.
The SG Elections Commis-
sion ruled unanimously Tues-
day night to issue a public rep-rimand to the party. 
The ruling was based on SG 
code 733.1, which says all can-didates must qualify with the name they’re registered with at 
UF or with a “reasonable varia-
tion of that name, subject to ap-proval of the Elections Commis-sion.”
Commissioner Matt Fried-
man said allowing candidates to run with nicknames unrelated to their given names could give them an unfair advantage. 
“If you hear the name ... John 
Taco Burrito Supreme Smith, it sounds way cooler than some-one else’s name,” Friedman said. “If you’re looking at candi-dates and you don’t really know much about the platforms, you’re probably going to pick the cooler-sounding name.”
The reprimand “will be a 
written declaration to the UF campus containing the violation of the party and a warning dis-couraging similar future viola-tions,” Elections Commission Chairwoman Celeste Thacker wrote in an email.
She said the reprimand will 
not restrict the Taco Libre Par-
ty’s ability to campaign.

such as Shannon “Salsalicious”

� THE STUDENTS AND TACO LIBRE 
PARTIES DID NOT PARTICIPATE.

The Swamp Party was the only Student 
Government party to hold traditional plat-
form generation events this semester.
Swamp candidates and representatives 
settled into corners of the Plaza of the Amer-
icas, Turlington Plaza and near the Reitz 
Union on Monday and Tuesday to gather ideas from students for their platform. Stu-dents could also contribute by tweeting         @swamppartyuf with the hashtag #swamp-cares.
Susan Webster, the Swamp Party spokes-
woman, said platform generation is impor-tant because it allows access to more student 
opinions for developing a platform.
“Swamp Party looks to build our plat-
form off of the needs of the students,” she 
wrote in an email.
During the two days, students inked 
their ideas onto white concept boards. 
Some student ideas called for increased 
scooter parking, more 24-hour libraries and better laundry options for on-campus 
students. Other ideas included Gatorade 
fountains, better SNAP service and bicycle rentals.
Katelynn Brown, a 19-year-old family 
youth and community science sophomore, added a check mark by an already written idea for more convenient parking options.
“It takes two seconds to write down 
(your idea) and maybe it will make a differ-
ence,” she said.Lila Stallone, a 20-year-old telecommuni-
cation sophomore, also signed the platform 
board and said she felt her contribution was 
meaningful.  
“It’s important because everyone’s voice 
can be heard,” she said. “Even if you’re not 
a representative or in Senate, it gives you an opportunity.”
The two other parties, Students Party 
and Taco Libre Party, did not participate in the platform generation event.
Alex Klayman, spokesperson for Stu-
dents Party, said its members will be an-nouncing their platform within the week, and though they did not participate in tradi-tional generation events, student input will drive the platform. 
“Too often the result of platform genera-
tion is that the parties end up with the same common sense changes on their agenda,” 
he wrote in an email. “Our party will par-
ticipate in open platform generation via ac-cepting suggestions at our table/on social media/etc.”
Stephanie Kreitzer, co-president of the 
Taco Libre Party, said Taco Libre did not participate because they are focused on a single goal — bringing Taco Bell back to campus.
“We believe we will be able to get more 
accomplished by staying focused on one thing at a time,” she wrote in an email.One party generates platform

Tickets are still on sale for 
the J. Cole and Chance The 
Rapper concert at the Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center on Feb. 
27 in honor of Black History Month.
Tickets first became avail-
able for students at noon Tuesday, when Student Gov-ernment Productions sold around 1,650 tickets of the 6,500-seat capacity. 
Iman Amaya, a 19-year-
old UF engineering freshman, waited in line for more than four hours to get his ticket to the show. Amaya said he 
has seen J. Cole before and 
can’t wait to see him perform again.
“I’m ready to go,” he said. 
“I never really expect the cali-ber of people they are going to bring.” 
Student tickets for the 
show are priced at $30 for floor-level seats and $15 for general seating. With one Gator 1 Card, students can 
purchase up to four tickets at 
the O’Connell Center box of-fice.
Tickets will be available 
for purchase by the general public on Thursday for $20 for general seating and $40 for floor-level seats. Nicole Berrio, SGP public 
relations director, said stu-dents seem to be really excited 
about the upcoming concert.
“We want to bring an 
eclectic blend of artists that 
fit the diverse music tastes 
of UF students,” said Berrio, 
a 21-year-old UF public rela-tions senior. “Last year we brought Kendrick Lamar, and we got a really big turnout. 
We wanted to bring someone 
comparable to Lamar.”
SGP paid $115,000 for J. 
Cole and $30,000 for Chance 
The Rapper.
Torri Elie, a 19-year-old UF 
pharmacy freshman, said she 
thinks UF made a great choice in selecting J. Cole.
“His lyrics are about real 
life and not about drugs and sex like some other rappers,” she said.Ticket sales start for J. Cole and Chance The Rapper concertNICOLE GIAQUINTO

The horses are ready at the starting gate. 
The bell sounds. And they’re off, leaving 
economic benefits in their tracks.  
A recent study conducted by Cummings 
Associates, a group commissioned by Flor-
ida horse racing and breeding organiza-
tions, found the industry generates about $1 billion, supplies more than 12,000 jobs in the state and pays $400 million in payroll to horse workers.
“That $1 billion industry makes us larg-
er than spring training baseball is for the state of Florida,” said Lonny Powell, CEO of Florida Thoroughbred Breeders’ and 
Owners’ Association. “So that just shows in 
relative terms how big the horse industry is in Florida.”
Florida’s horse industry ranked No. 2 
behind Kentucky in terms of economic im-pact, he said.
The warm climate plays a big role.“You gotta give the good Lord and 
Mother Nature a lot of credit, because if we 
didn’t have the weather we have. I don’t 
think we’d have nearly the horse industry,” Powell said.
Summer Best, a Marion County horse 
farm owner and UF graduate student in the journalism college, said she’s glad the horse industry is thriving in Florida.
“Most people aren’t aware of the tre-
mendous economic impact that comes along with horse sales, breeding, showing, racing and recreational riding or driving. These days we have some horses that fly on jets, and some horses as pets — all contrib-uting,” said Best, who also worked for the 
Florida Thoroughbred Breeders’ and Own-
ers’ Association for about six years.
Just a short drive from Gainesville and 
with more than 70 percent of Florida’s thor-oughbreds, Ocala is one of the largest areas in the country where horses are trained and bred for races and breeding purposes, Pow-ell said.
Live Oak Stud is one of the more than 
200 horse breeding and training centers in Ocala. The center has a couple hundred horses, making it an influential force in the racing community in Ocala, said Gen-eral Manager Bruce Hill. He said he thinks Florida’s horse industry will continue to ad-vance in the upcoming years.
“The horse industry has survived reces-
sions and depressions and economic booms 
for centuries. This is nothing new,” Hill 
said. “You have to ride those waves out, but this is something that the horse busi-ness people love.”Florida horses gallop their way 
to big industry, study shows  
UNF also filed a motion to dismiss; the case went to court
in compliance with the court decision and the law,” Glisch 
said. “After that, Florida Carry might just move on.”
Caranna said that if the college changes its policy to be 
in compliance, the group will drop its lawsuit — but until then, Florida Carry will continue to sue any state campus that doesn’t fall in line with the court’s decision.
According to Duval County court records, UNF also filed 
a motion to dismiss within the early months of its lawsuit.Caranna said motions to dismiss are fairly common, and 
he’s “really not all that concerned.”
According to UF’s motion to dismiss, Florida Carry’s law-
suit “fails to demonstrate standing” for its claims that the university violated the Florida Constitution and various state statutes because of its anti-gun vehicle and residency policies. It also stated Florida Carry failed to mention even one of its 
members who was “substantially affected” by the university’s 
alleged violation of the December court decision.
Caranna said he believes otherwise.“I think they need to re-read our brief, because it does say 
that,” he said.
He said Florida Carry refuses to name its members in UF’s 
faculty and student body, because they fear academic or other reprisals from the university.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said last week that she 
could not comment on the university’s legal proceedings.gun , from page 1“Last year we brought

In a succinct Student Senate meeting Tuesday, 
senators unanimously approved funding for two 
groups, enacted the Senator Accountability Act 
and presented a new system for budget requests.
Sen. Joseph Michaels and Sen. Joselin Padron-
Rasines, who presented the new system, said the 
changes will make creating and managing budget requests easier for organizations.
“The system hasn’t been updated in years. It 
was just something that wasn’t cutting it any-more,” Michaels said. 
Padron-Rasines said it will add percentages 
and dollar amounts automatically. 
It’s updated live so the budget committee can 
comment on it and ensure organizations are fol-lowing codes.
Additionally, funding for the Iranian Student Association and Ph.D. Moms was unanimously passed, allocating about $2,000 and $1,200 to the organizations, respectively.
The Senator Accountability Act, which passed 
through its second reading and now awaits a sig-nature from the Senate President, was enacted.
Senate President Pro Tempore Elliot Grasso 
said the act adjusts constituency periods to sync up with academic semesters.
“It’s going to be able to hold senators a lot 
more accountable and able to reach out to their 
constituents,” Grasso said.Senate approves club budget system

Gainesville Police arrested two 
locals at a trafﬁ  c stop Monday 
night after the driver swallowed a 
bag of cocaine and the passenger 
hid crack cocaine in his butt.
Police arrested 24-year-old 
Regina Lakeisha Symonette on 
charges of battery on an ofﬁ  cer, 
destroying evidence, possession of a controlled substance and re-
sisting an ofﬁ  cer, according to an 
arrest report. Ofﬁ  cers also arrested John 
Nehemiah Goodman Jr., 29, on 
charges of cocaine possession and 
possession with intent to sell, ac-cording to the report.
At about 11:45 p.m., an ofﬁ  cer 
stopped the car Symonette was 
driving for running a stop sign 
and drifting lanes. 
The ofﬁ  cer spotted a bag of 
cocaine in her unzipped pants, ac-
cording to the report.
The ofﬁ  cer reached for the co-
caine and Symonette grabbed the ofﬁ  cer’s hand. 
After a struggle, Symonette 
snatched the bag and swallowed 
it, according to the report. Meanwhile, Goodman had 
several pieces of crack cocaine in 
his seat as well. 
At the jail, Goodman admitted 
to hiding crack up his butt, ac-
cording to the report. 
He then removed a ChapStick 
tube with a bag of 0.2 grams of cocaine and ﬁ  ve pieces of crack cocaine. 
Ofﬁ  cers concluded the amount 
was too much for recreational use.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Symonette 
and Goodman into the Alachua County Jail early Tuesday morn-ing, where they remained as of press time.Man arrested with crack in his crack“The system hasn’t been updated in

had a subsidy: 
Senate passes farm bill
While the world wasn’t looking, the U.S. Senate passed 
what CNN called “the most overlooked mega-bill of the past 12 months”: a $1 trillion spending measure 
that sets ﬁ  ve years of eating and farming policy in the United States. It’s been commonly labelled a “farm bill,” but CNN 
claimed it will be much, much more. 
“While it’s called the farm bill, in truth, it’s more of a food 
bill,” wrote Lisa Desjardins, a reporter for CNN. “Whatever you 
think of Congress, this is a bill that deserves some attention.”
Two years of gridlock have prevented the bill from passing, 
but yesterday, bipartisan support propelled the legislation to President Obama’s desk. He’s expected to sign it into law. The biggest points of the bill, according to The New York Times, are cuts to food stamps, expansion of the crop insurance program 
and the elimination of direct payments to farmers in the form of 
crop subsidies. 
This is important, folks: This bill not only affects the econ-
omy, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — food stamps — and the farming industry, but it also directly affects the food on your plate. 
Among the measures, Desjardins wrote, are plans to require 
pork, chicken and beef suppliers to provide more information for consumers on where and how the animal was born, slaugh-
tered and processed. 
The bill will change crop subsidy policies — which have re-
mained the same for the past 82 years — and end government 
funding that farmers receive regardless of their harvest quality or crop prices. However, the federal government won’t be leav-ing rural farmers out in the cold: The U.S. plans to subsidize cheaper crop insurance, which would cause the government to absorb any ﬁ  nancial hits that farmers might face during low-yield seasons. 
The most controversial change, however, are the cuts to 
SNAP. Over the next 10 years, the government plans to cut $8 billion from the program, according to the Times, which will af-fect an estimated 1.7 million people whose beneﬁ  ts will be cut by about $90 per month. Proponents of the bill argue it closes a loophole that has allowed states to exploit the program by help-ing recipients get more beneﬁ  ts than they’re qualiﬁ  ed for. At the same time, the bill will add $205 million to food banks. 
That the bill passed with such strong bipartisan support — 68 
to 32 — speaks to both parties’ faith in the program. 
“Given all the complexity and competing interests, I think 
they did an adequate job,” said Dan Glickman, a former agri-culture secretary and member of Congress, according to the Times. 
The farm industry has been at a stalemate for so long with 
policies such as the existing crop-insurance program dating back to the Dust Bowl. As food becomes increasingly more political with issues ranging from food deserts in places like New Mexico 
to the crooked practices of fast food companies, it’s encouraging 
that our famously unproductive Senate is doing work and pass-ing legislation on an issue that affects all Americans.Scott’s shady donations crony capitalism
As Gov. Rick Scott gears up for his 2014 re-election campaign, his primary focus has shifted away from dealing with the many critical issues our state faces. 
Instead, he has decided to devote the bulk of his energy to-ward fundraising for his re-election bid in advance of the 
November election. 
Scott will need all the money he can possibly raise. In 
2010, Scott spent $85 million on his successful gubernato-
rial bid, which included more than $73 million of his own family’s money. Even after spending that enormous sum, he barely defeated Democratic nominee Alex Sink, the former Florida chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer.
Scott faces an uphill battle in his re-election bid. A re-
cent Quinnipiac University poll found the governor trailing 
presumptive Democratic nominee and former Gov. Charlie 
Crist, 46 percent to 38 percent. Among those surveyed in the poll, 54 percent said that Scott does not deserve a second term as governor.
A separate survey by Public Policy Polling found Scott’s 
approval rating at 34 percent, compared to a 51 percent dis-approval rating. These numbers rank Scott as one of the six least-popular governors in America. 
Scott’s fundraising in 2010 shattered previous campaign 
spending records in Florida, and the governor seems well on his way to breaking those records again in 2014. He recently appointed a new campaign ﬁ  nance director, South Florida health-care executive Miguel Fernandez.
Fernandez is a strong supporter of the governor; he and 
his companies have given more than $1.8 million to Scott’s re-election bid. This includes a $1 million check to a re-election committee supporting the governor, the largest donation to any candidate election fund in American history. 
These donations are perfectly legal, thanks to the Citizens 
United ruling and other Supreme Court decisions disman-tling campaign ﬁ  nance regulations across America. Howev-er, recent business dealings between Fernandez and the state of Florida suggest motivations for Fernandez’s donations beyond heartfelt support for Scott.
Fernandez’s companies recently won contracts from the 
state to serve Medicaid patients throughout central and south Florida as part of the gover-nor’s private-sector focused “man-aged care” initiative. The contracts for just one of the two companies could be worth as much as $2.7 bil-
lion in the ﬁ  rst year alone.
There is some indication that 
Fernandez’s companies were not 
the best choice for these awards of taxpayer dollars. On the website of 
Better Health, one of Fernandez’s companies that was giv-en a contract, the ﬁ  rm’s “Executive Summary” and “Senior Management Team” are each completely omitted. 
Better Health’s shoddily constructed website is clearly 
not indicative of a business deserving of billions of dollars in Florida taxpayer funds. 
These contracts perfectly encapsulate the “crony capi-
talism” that has come to deﬁ  ne American politics in recent years. Rather than focusing on providing vital government services effectively and at low cost, elected ofﬁ  cials focus on rewarding campaign donors and the politically well con-nected. 
Scott’s relationship with Fernandez is not the only exam-
ple of questionable political conduct involving the governor in recent days. CNN reported on a $1.8 million lobbying con-tract given by Scott to a political supporter, former U.S. Sec-retary of Veteran’s Affairs Anthony Principi. Principi hosted a fundraiser for the governor and personally donated $10,000 to Scott’s re-election campaign. Although these ﬁ  nancial transactions with Principi did not involve taxpayer money, Scott’s tendency to reward the politically and ﬁ  nancially con-nected has deﬁ  ned his tenure as Florida governor.
The people of Florida deserve better than a governor more 
focused on rewarding wealthy donors than on confronting the issues facing our state. By voting Scott out of ofﬁ  ce in November, voters can reject both crony capitalism and our system of campaign ﬁ  nance, both of which amount to little more than forms of legalized bribery.

“Lame duck” 
is too mis-leading a de-
scription of the re-maining years of 
President Barack 
Obama’s time in ofﬁ  ce. Labelling a term “lame duck” implies that noth-ing will get done in Washing-ton, and everyone knows it. The truth is, nothing will indeed happen, but the chief executive 
will try everything in his power 
to convince you otherwise. 
In the State of the Union ad-
dress Jan. 28, Obama presented vague promises and ideals — many recycled from previous State of the Union speeches — to a tuned-out public. 
The president called for a 
“year of action.” 
This year of action makes 
sense when you recall that last year was a year of reaction — reaction to the fumbling of the Obamacare website, the IRS scandal and the NSA revela-tions. 
But this well-wished year of 
action falls far too short. Simply conjuring up ambiguous plans for income equality, job cre-ation and foreign policy for this year fails to adequately address the needs of the present.   
When we take a step back 
and glance at the real state of the union, we see a population 
hopelessly divided. Every is-
sue imaginable — from picking which shows to watch to decid-ing which company brands you should support — somehow falls along political party lines. 
The majority of Americans 
believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. Most un-
fortunately, the American peo-
ple are tragically disillusioned about the future of the country. 
This proposed year of ac-
tion is a far cry from this reality. Even if the president had his way, his actions would not cut the surface of what the country really needs. 
But the year of action re-
mains hopelessly dead on ar-rival. The midterm elections will overwhelmingly inﬂ  uence this year, but the president’s lack of leadership will doom this actionable year from even starting.  
The campaign commercials, 
the bumper stickers and yard signs are already coming out. For some lawmakers, the choice between drafting controversial legislation that would change the country and campaigning is clear. Retaining one’s seat — to, of course, enact real change in Washington later — trumps 
actually making things happen 
in the present.
Comprehensive immigra-
tion reform, minimum wage increases and other grand initia-tives look bleaker each congressional campaign day. 
But the reality 
remains that noth-ing will get done in Washington. The president can-
not lead, but he tells the nation otherwise. In his State of the Union speech, Obama tried to convince the nation that better 
times were ahead, the gridlock 
would soon break, and the candidate of hope and change would deliver. But national headlines and opinion polls  in-dicate otherwise. 
The only real achievement 
of the president’s time in ofﬁ  ce is passing the Affordable Care 
Act through a Democratic Con-
gress. But when Republicans took the House in 2010, his lofty presidential ambitions went si-lent. 
Obama threatened to cir-
cumvent Congress if his de-mands were not met. This president, unable to commu-
nicate with Democrats and 
Republicans alike on the Hill, completely skipped the possi-bility of engaging members of both parties and decided that he was the only person to push his agenda. 
The president plans to indi-
vidually mandate a pay raise 
for federal contract employees. 
But sweeping immigration re-form, welfare initiatives and educational reforms cannot be done by executive action alone. Congress is still in play and still important. 
Leadership does not mean 
circumventing a branch of Con-
gress if you don’t get what you 
want. It means working with the opposition party.  
During the Clinton admin-
istration, the chief executive had to deal with a zealous Re-publican Party that controlled Congress. Unlike Obama, he engaged the Republican leader-
ship and brought reform in bi-
partisan fashion. Clinton made what some called a lame-duck presidency into real presiden-tial years — note the plural — of action.  
One would assume that a 
true year of action should start with an action. No, this year, 
like so many before, started 
with a vague and unpromising speech devoid of concrete plans but full of false hopes.   
Even though some will de-
cry Republicans for stymieing the year of action, the presi-dent’s lack of leadership will secure his lame-duck status and 
place in history.

opinions@alligator.orgLast week in the Alligator’s Gato-
rAid advice column, Leslie Cole responded to an anonymous stu-
dent’s question, “I’m a girl, but I’m not 21. What are good old-fashioned ways to 
have fun without drinking?”
Leslie’s advice promoted illegal and 
potentially harmful activities and pro-
moted a negative campus culture that implies heavy alcohol use is imperative for social success.
The Independent Florida Alligator is a profession-
al organization with a vested interest in UF students. Students view the Alligator as a source of credible in-formation and may reference articles as authoritative. 
As peer educators with STRIVE at GatorWell, we are 
concerned with the newspaper’s endorsement of dan-gerous and illegal behaviors that may jeopardize the health of our students. In response to Leslie’s advice, we feel it is important for students to know the facts.
Possessing a fake ID in the state of Florida is a 
third-degree felony penalized by up to ﬁ  ve years in jail and a $5,000 ﬁ  ne. Anyone who lends a form of identiﬁ  cation and the borrower can be charged with 
a second-degree misdemeanor and up to 60 days in 
jail and a $500 ﬁ  ne.
The responsibility of the sober designated person 
goes beyond just driving. People who choose to drink heavily are vulnerable to alcohol poisoning, embar-rassing behaviors, outbursts of violence and even victimization. The designated sober person is tasked with watching out for his or her friends and respon-sibilities including being a proactive bystander to en-
sure safety, intervening if you notice someone is tak-ing advantage of your friends and calling 
for medical help in instances of possible alcohol poisoning; UF’s Medical Amnesty Policy is applicable in these situations.
Leslie’s third point of advice encour-
ages women to barter sexual favors for drinks or entrance into a club. Objectifying women’s bodies and treating sexual activ-
ity as a commodity are prime examples of behaviors that perpetuate rape culture. No favor should come with an expectation for sexual touching in exchange. Using bribes for sexual activity is referred to as coer-cion and is considered an act of sexual assault.
Lastly, underage girls were advised to slip into 
the bathroom with legal-aged friends to share sips of their drinks. Providing alcohol to a minor is a misde-meanor under Florida law. Offenders can be charged up to $1,000 in ﬁ  nes and may be required to serve up to one year in jail.
In a blog last July, “50 must-know tips for surviv-
ing UF,” Cole noted “not every college student in the world drinks, smokes, sleeps around and/or does drugs. You don’t have to do it, promise.”
She also encouraged moderation of such behav-
iors and endorsed campus resources, including Ga-torWell Health Promotion Services. We thank her for that and hope that her future blogs will be consider-ate of the diverse people at UF, the diverse choices we make and the health and safety of UF students.

Speaking Out
The Super Bowl is arguably 
the most-watched event in television history, which is 
why commercial ad slots sell out fast and for ridiculous amounts of 
money. The commercials are talked 
about for weeks after the play clock runs out, and most companies pur-chasing advertising slots during the actual game want to put their best foot forward.
Coca-Cola ran an ad featuring 
“America the Beautiful” sung in a variety of languages, and people are up in arms about it. Apparent-ly, without the rest of us being told, English is perceived as the “ofﬁ  cial” language of the United States, and everyone must use it.
The ad was meant to transcend 
more than just the differences in language; America is a beauti-ful conglomeration of individuals from every race, religion and back-ground. 
The U.S. doesn’t have an ofﬁ  cial 
language, and if we wanted to speak “American,” we’d all better learn to speak Cherokee, Yup’ik and other Native American languages.
America is supposed to mean 
life, liberty and the pursuit of hap-piness. 
If everyone is upset about a Co-
ca-Cola ad with “America the Beau-tiful” in different languages (with the predominant one being English, in case people forgot), then we are doing something very wrong.

Unemployment and low 
salaries are every college grad-
uate’s nightmare, but a new 
online tool can help students 
avoid a career crisis. 
BeyondEducation.org of-
fers an online database that 
can guide students to make im-portant career decisions after 
graduation.
The website contains in-
formation about employment 
and salaries earned by gradu-
ates with various degrees from 
public institutions in the state of Florida. 
Its information is based on 
data from October to December 
2011.
The information, provided 
by the Florida Department of 
Economic Opportunity, is re-
quired by law to be accessible by the public, namely, students and their parents, according to BeyondEducation’s website.
For some UF students, such 
as 22-year-old family youth and community science senior 
Alec Spaulding, salary is not a 
factor in choosing a career. 
“As long as I have a roof 
over my head I’m happy,” Spaulding said.
Other UF students, such as 
19-year-old psychology sopho-
more Franklin Reuter, said it 
couldn’t hurt to browse for em-ployment information.
“I’m pretty certain about 
what I want to do, but you have to think about whether you’ll even get a job,” Reuter said. “If the site said that barely anyone in my degree got employed after graduating, then I might look into something else.”
As a recent alumna, Kaydri-
anne Young, 23, said the web-site would have “somewhat 
of an inﬂ  uence” on her career 
choices.
“I always thought about 
making enough to be comfort-
able,” she said.
Heather White, the director 
at UF’s Career Resource Cen-
ter, said she stresses to students that a degree or major does not 
equal a career.
Employers look for skills sets 
and experience, White said.
Even though the site’s in-
formation could be beneﬁ  cial 
to students, White said, there 
are other resources that could 
broaden career possibilities for students.
The CRC hosts employer 
relations seminars, workshops and presentations to help stu-dents, she said.
“We provide all imaginable 
resources that assist students 
into getting into the workforce 
after graduating,” White said.New website helps guide students 
toward post-grad career choices
“If the site said that 
barely anyone in my 
degree got employed after 
graduating, then I might 
look into something else.”

Alligator Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
National Signing Day is finally here. 
Recruits all over the country will be 
sending their letters of intents as early 
as 7 a.m. today. Florida’s current 2014 
class is ranked seventh in the nation, ac-cording to Rivals.com, despite finishing the 2013 season with a 4-8 record. 
CBS Sports Recruiting Analyst Tom 
Lemming thinks the poor record actu-ally helps recruiting wise.
“I’ve seen that go with Ohio State 
when they had a bad year, and when 
Notre Dame had a bad year,” Lemming 
said. “They have great recruiting years that follow mainly because they have a great tradition. They’ve got a great 
fan following and also the players un-
derstand that they have a better shot at starting because they did have a bad year, and none of those senior jobs are safe.”
One of the most sought after of-
fensive tackles in the country, Damian Prince, took his final official visit to UF last weekend. He told ESPN.com that it was the “best official he has taken.” 
Prince is set to announce at 10 a.m. to-
day from his high school in Forestville, Md. The announcement will air on ES-PNU.
“Maryland is throwing out every-
thing they can at him because their class isn’t very good,” Lemming said. “Getting the No. 1 player in the state could help enhance the public image.”
Prince would help add depth to a 
weakened Florida line, which returns only five players with starting experi-ence. There are currently five offensive lineman in UF’s 2014 class. Keep an eye 
on offensive lineman Derrick Kelly and 
Andrew Mike on Wednesday as poten-tial flips for UF. 
The No. 9 overall recruit in the 2014 
class is five star athlete Adoree’ Jackson. Jackson went to high school in Garde-na, Calif., but is originally from Illinois. He took last-minute visits to USC and UCLA over the weekend, which could 
mean bad news for the Gators. LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
The big story leading into Tues-
day night was Chris Walker’s much-
awaited debut, but Gators fans got only a small dose of the freshman forward during No. 3 Florida’s 
68-58 win against Missouri in the 
O’Connell Center.
Walker recorded four points, two 
rebounds, two blocks and two fouls in only seven minutes on the court. All of his points came on two alley-oop dunks on assists from freshman point guard Kasey Hill.
“I’m so glad to finally have it be-
hind me,” Walker said. “My coaches and teammates just been keeping me motivated and I just let it go. That’s what I did.”
Added coach Billy Donovan: “I 
thought he contributed very, very positively with the seven minutes that he played. I was really proud, more than anything, because I really 
didn’t know what to expect.”
Walker checked into the game 
at the 11:28 mark in the first half — 
the latest of any player in Florida’s rotation. The freshman forward had waited 12 games — a suspension the NCAA handed him for receiving im-permissible benefits as an amateur prospect — for his moment to finally play. 
Before his suspension, he was not 
enrolled at UF in the fall semester due to academic eligibility issues.
When Walker first walked to the 
scorer’s table, the O’Connell Center roared with game action still ongo-ing.
“Dang, Chris, you’re really about 
to step onto this court and play for 
the Florida Gators for real,” Walker 
said, imitating his thought process through the moment. “This is not high school anymore. This is real.”
On his second defensive posses-
sion of the night, Walker blocked Mizzou guard Earnest Ross’ floater down the lane and to loud applause. 
“It kind of relaxed me,” Walker 
said of his first block. “It felt good to do something.”
Eighteen seconds after the 6-foot-
10 Bonifay native checked back into the game with 2:25 in the first half, Walker received a lob from Hill, his former AAU teammate, and threw down a two-handed slam to tie the game at 23. 
The freshmen duo repeated the 
same play with six seconds remain-
ing in the half.
“I just looked in his eyes and it 
brought back flashbacks,” Walker 
said. “I just looked down and was like, ‘Oh.’ He just threw it up and I got it.”
Walker did not see much time 
on the floor in the second half. He played about only two minutes dur-
ing the late stretch of the contest, 
checking in at the 9:45 mark.
“I don’t think his expectation 
was, ‘I’m going to come in here and play 25 to 30 minutes,’” Donovan said. “He knew that.”
Thanks to Missouri’s early suc-
cess mixing zone defenses and Flor-ida’s struggles from behind the arc 
— the Gators (20-2, 9-0 Southeastern 
Conference) shot 1 of 11 from three-point range in the game’s first 20 minutes — the first half was tightly contested. The Tigers (16-6, 4-5 SEC) went on a 7-2 run to lead 23-18, but Florida responded with a 7-2 run of its own to tie things up.
But after Walker’s second alley-

� FLORIDA 4-0 FOR THIRD TIME IN 
FOUR SEASONS.IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @ibcohen5
Florida may have many new faces, but 
the results have stayed the same.
With the first four matches of the season 
behind them, the Gators are 4-0 and have 
outscored their opponents 22-0, with one win coming against a top-20 opponent.
Where does this regular season start rank 
amongst the past three years, two of which ended in a national title and the other in a conference championship?
In 2011, Florida also began the season 
with four consecutive shutout wins on their 
way to a 10-0 start, defeating ranked oppo-
nents No. 4 North Carolina, No. 9 Miami, No. 12 Clemson and twice against No. 6 Duke. 
Florida ended the year as NCAA cham-
pions.
In 2012, the team began 5-0 before losing 
their only dual match of the season to No. 2 Stanford en route to a second straight title.
In 2013, the Gators opened the season 
with three consecutive shutouts, finished with a 26-3 record and won the Southeastern Conference Championship.
“Obviously our team always has pretty 
high set goals, you know, we always aim to be SEC champions; we try our best to go un-
defeated,” senior Alexandra Cercone said.
The truth is, high expectations are noth-
ing new to the Gators.
“We want to win the title,” senior Sofie 
Oyen said. “But we’re playing really well 
now so hopefully we can continue to stay this good.”
So far, Florida is play-
ing according to its stan-
dards. But fast starts can 
be deceiving.
Compared to the remainder of the season, 
the schedule up to this point has been rela-
tively easy. The Gators have beaten Louis-
ville, Harvard and Central Florida — teams ranked outside the top 50. Their toughest opponent up to this point has been No. 19 Baylor. 
Florida’s first true test will come Friday 
when they play in the National Team In-doors alongside fifteen of the top twenty teams in the country.  
From there, competition only grows 
more difficult. Some of Florida’s opponents in the weeks ahead include No. 27 Florida State, No. 1 Stanford, No. 7 Texas A&M, No. 4 Georgia and No. 12 Alabama.
“We have a tough, tough schedule ahead 
of us this spring,” coach Roland Thornqvist Gators off to familiar hot start

Florida showed its youth during its 
performance in its ﬁ  rst tournament of the 
spring.
The Gators placed sixth out of 16 teams 
to end the two-day Sea Best Invitational 
on Tuesday afternoon, shooting a collec-
tive 918, 54 strokes over par.
North Florida and Liberty ended round 
three tied for ﬁ  rst, each shooting 886 (+22). Liberty was declared the champion after shooting a lower score in round three.
Florida entered Day 2 of the tourna-
ment, hosted at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Ve-dra, tied for ﬁ  fth with Southeastern Con-
ference rival Tennessee and Winthrop.
Because darkness had fallen before the 
teams could complete Monday’s scheduled 
36 holes, the Gators began Tuesday with their ﬁ  nal three holes in round two, then ﬁ  nished with 18 holes in round three.
Coach Buddy Alexander was pleased 
with his team’s start this morning, but then things turned sour for the Gators.
“I think after nine holes we had moved 
up to about third place,” he said. “All ﬁ  ve guys were hanging in there and playing pretty well, and then the bottom just kind of fell out.”
Alexander had put together a young 
lineup for Sea Best, starting two freshmen and a sophomore transfer in addition to junior J.D. Tomlinson and redshirt junior 
Santiago Gavino.
“Young teams sometimes have to learn 
how to keep it going,” Alexander said. 
“Sometimes they have to learn to get a good start and sometimes they have to learn how to ﬁ  nish.”
Sophomore transfer Richard Donegan 
ended his Florida debut tied for 24th place after shooting rounds of 73, 78 and 77, placing the highest of the Gators. He also led Monday for Florida when he ﬁ  nished 
the day tied for ninth place.
Tomlinson improved throughout the 
tournament, jumping from a tie for 48th 
place on Monday to a tie for 31st Tuesday. In his ﬁ  rst round, he shot an uncharacter-istic 79 (+7) but then played a 75 second round and 77 third round to ﬁ  nish at 15 strokes over par.
Freshman Ryan Orr and Gavino tied 
for 41st place, each shooting 233 (+17). Freshman Victor Tarnstrom rounded out the Gator lineup, ending in a tie for 46th place after shooting 234 (+18), one stroke more than Orr and Gavino.
Florida will next host the SunTrust 
Gator Invitational from Feb. 15-16 at Mark Bostick Golf Course. The Gators placed fourth out of 14 teams in last spring’s tour-nament.
“Now we’re halfway through the sea-
son and we have to start making prog-ress,” Alexander said. “Hopefully the Gator (SunTrust Gator Invitational) will 
be a little better.”Gators ﬁ  nish sixth of 16
� RICHIE INCOGNITO’S SUSPEN-
SION WAS LIFTED TUESDAY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — The NFL’s report in the 
Miami Dolphins bullying case is expect-
ed to be released soon, shedding further light on the much-scrutinized, troubled relationship between offensive linemen 
Jonathan Martin and Richie Incognito.
The report likely will address wheth-
er the Dolphins organization was at 
fault for the locker-room culture that led Martin to leave the team last October. He later said he was harassed daily by teammates, including Incognito, and al-leged their racial, aggressive and sexu-ally charged comments played a role in 
his departure.
Incognito’s suspension by the team 
was lifted Tuesday. Dolphins ofﬁ  cials 
say that was an administrative move agreed to by all parties last year, and had nothing to do with any new devel-opments in the league investigation of the case.
Last week, Dolphins owner Stephen 
Ross said he has an idea of what will be in the league’s report, and indicated he doesn’t expect any new revelations. He said he’s proud of the way the people running the franchise responded to the scandal.
Martin has said he tried to be friends 
with Incognito. The two players traded more a thousand text messages in a year’s span, and the teasing and vulgar banter went both ways, with references to sex, drugs, violence and bawdy be-havior, often in a jocular tone.
The back-and-forth continued last 
week. In his ﬁ  rst interview since the 
scandal broke, Martin told NBC persis-
tent vulgar language around the team made him feel trapped. Incognito’s at-torney Mark Schamel responded with a statement saying Martin was “hiding behind false allegations” rather than dealing with “his poor on-ﬁ  eld perfor-mance and myriad other issues.”
The NFL report will come from New 
York attorney Ted Wells three months after he was retained by the league to investigate the case, which inspired a national debate about hazing and work-place bullying.
Wells will determine the role of 
coach Joe Philbin, his staff and Miami management in the case. One issue is whether anyone on the coaching staff 
ordered Incognito to toughen up Mar-
tin, who became a starter as a rookie in 2012 but played poorly at times.
Martin has said people in the orga-
nization knew he was unhappy about comments teammates made to him, but he didn’t talk to Philbin about it.
The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin 
abruptly left the team Oct. 28. He was 
brieﬂ  y hospitalized and then joined his 
family in California and underwent counseling for emotional issues. Incog-nito was suspended Nov. 3 and sat out the ﬁ  nal eight games.Dolphin report to be released
“Young teams sometimes have 
to learn how to keep it going. 
Sometimes they have to learn to 
get a good start and sometimes 
they have to learn how to ﬁ  nish.”

UF coachThe one thing that could 
swing Jackson to UF is the 
track and field program, as 
he is interested in pursuing 
a track career while playing football. 
Jackson will announce to-
morrow from his high school at 2 p.m. on ESPNU. Lemming sees Jackson, who has primar-ily played cornerback, playing more on offense if he goes to 
UF.
“He is an outstanding wide 
receiver and kick returner,” he 
said. “They won’t keep him off 
the field, it’s just a matter of 
where they play him if Florida gets him. He’s a unique tal-ent.” 
Florida target Lorenzo 
Carter will also be announcing tomorrow. 
The No. 3 defensive end 
from Norcross, Ga., is deciding 
between Georgia, LSU, FSU 
and Florida. Carter took his official visit to Athens over the weekend. Carter’s announce-ment will air on ESPNU at 
3p.m. 
Wide receiver Isaiah McK-
enzie is deciding between 
Florida, Virginia Tech and Ole 
Miss on Wednesday at 8:30a.m. 
McKenzie visited Florida on Jan. 17. 
“McKenzie is an exciting ball player when you watch him on film,” Lemming said. 
“He can create after the catch. 
He’s small but a physically tough tackle even though he is small. I really like him.”
Three-star wide receiver 
C.J. Worton will be picking between Florida and West Vir-ginia. Worton was previously committed to FSU, but decom-
mitted last week — just two 
days after he officially visited UF.
FSU verbal quarterback 
commit Treon Harris could potentially flip to Florida on Wednesday. He visited UF on Jan. 17. Lemming  had high praise for the dual-threat QB.
“He fits a spread offense 
like a Russell Wilson or a Cam Newton where he can throw the ball. He’s exciting throw-
ing the ball on the run,” Lem-
ming said. 
Gators flip offensive line-
man: Florida added depth 
to its depleted offensive line Tuesday night when three-star prospect Andrew Mike an-nounced he had committed to Florida. 
The 6-foot-7, 280-pound 
linebacker had previously been committed to Vanderbilt. 
Mike, a Tucson, Ariz., na-
tive, is the No. 60 offensive 
lineman in the class, according 
to Rivals.com. 
Mike is the sixth offensive 
lineman in UF’s 2014 class.oop dunk of the night with six sec-
onds left in the half, Jabari Brown 
sunk a three-pointer at the buzzer to give Missouri a 28-25 halftime lead.
In the second half, Frazier and 
the Gators finally found their three-point shooting touch.
After Missouri led 45-43 with 
9:57 remaining, Florida went on a 16-3 run over a span of 6:36 thanks to three treys by Frazier. A hook 
shot by center Patric Young gave UF 
a 58-48 lead with 4:10 left.
Senior point guard Scottie Wil-
bekin made eight free throws to seal the win for the Gators and finish with a game-high 19 points.
Frazier added 14 points on 5-of-
12 shooting for Florida.
The Gators are on a 14-game win-
ning streak and have won 28 consec-utive games in the O’Connell Center heading into Saturday’s home con-
test against Alabama. 
With Walker’s debut finally out 
of the way, Donovan hopes the hype 
will settle down. 
“I never wanted him to feel like 
he walked off the floor in his first game and felt like, ‘I was a big disap-pointment tonight,’” Donovan said. “I’m happy ... he feels good about 
himself.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Belinda Woolcock swings at the ball during Florida’s 4-0 win against Louisville on Jan. 25 in the Ring 
Tennis Complex. Woolcock and the Gators have not lost a doubles point despite occasional struggles.
Gators winning doubles 
points despite occasional struggles with pairings
said. “I don’t know who made the 
schedule, but it’ll be fun.”
Despite a perfect record and high 
expectations, UF still has some issues to address if it expects to continue winning against better teams in Feb-ruary.
The most challenging obstacle this 
year has been developing chemistry in doubles. 
Against Louisville, freshman 
Belinda Woolcock and sophomore 
Brianna Morgan lost the first match 
6-2, requiring the other two pairs to win both their matches to capture the doubles point. 
In their next meet, Cercone and 
freshman Stefani Stojic fell behind 4-3 against Harvard before being bailed out by Oyen and freshman Kourtney Keegan, who barely escaped with a 6-4 win to take the doubles point.
“We couldn’t hit the ball in the 
ocean for a little bit in a couple spots,” Thornqvist said of the dual match against Harvard. 
With the addition of three fresh-
men to this year’s team, a greater significance is placed on developing new doubles pairings that can win on a consistent basis.
 Thornqvist knows the team must 
play much better if their end goal is another title — the fourth during his tenure with the Gators. 
“It gets tougher from here on out,” 
Thornqvist said. 
“Our message after this weekend 
is look, the first hurdle, we handled it. 
“But it’s going to get tougher and 
we have to make sure we manage all the little details right here because February is just brutal.” tenniS , from page 13
