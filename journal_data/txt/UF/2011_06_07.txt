OKLAHOMA CITY — In a continuation of UF’s 
woes against the Pac-10 in Women’s College World 
Series finals, Florida (56-12) lost 14-4 to Arizona 
State (59-6) on Monday in Game 1 of the best-of-
three national championship series.
After tearing through the early innings Sunday 
against Alabama, Florida fell victim to opening 
troubles.
In the first inning, there was a controversial no-
call on a pitch that appeared to hit Tiffany DeFe-
lice’s right arm.
The botched call resulted in a lengthy umpire 
confrontation for UF coach Tim Walton and a bevy 
of postgame criticism on umpire Chris Drumm, 
who the Gators previously complained about on Friday.
“It didn’t hit the bat at all,” Florida’s catcher 
said. “I don’t know if bone sounds like bat, but it 
hit me right in the arm. It welled up like a snow-
ball. ... It was a rough night with that umpire, and it was a rough time the last time we had her too.”
“I hope nobody twists this and says I’m blam-
ing the umpire on our loss,” Kelsey Bruder said. “But again, it was just absolutely miserable. The worst ever.”

RALEIGH, N.C. — A North Carolina lawmaker doesn’t 
think it was right for his daughter and her third-grade class to write to him and other elected officials protesting possible cuts in state education spending.
Republican state Rep. Mike Stone says his daughter asked 
in her note to “please raise the budget, dad” and help keep two teacher assistants employed.
Lee County Schools Superintendent Jeff Moss told WRAL-
TV he didn’t see the writing exercise as a problem.

UF can’t overcome 
poor pitching, um-piring in Game 1
n THE SURVEY IS OPEN UNTIL JULY 1.
By EMILY MORROW
Alligator Writer
The football ticket lottery closed Friday, but UF students 
still have the opportunity to put in their two bits about their university experience.
The Student Experience in the Research University sur -
vey, a requirement to register for the lottery, will remain open until July 1.
As of Monday afternoon, 18,748 students had responded — about 61 percent of undergraduate students. 
“It’s really hard to ignore that amount of data,” said Ma-
rie Zeglen, the assistant provost and director of institutional planning and research.
This is the second time UF has employed the SERU sur -
vey. The first was in 2009, when approximately 69 percent of undergraduates responded.
Not everyone takes the survey seriously. Ste-
fan Rodriguez, a 21-year-old civil engineering 
student, said he Christmas-treed the 25-minute-long survey so he could register for tickets. 
But he is in the minority, Zegler said. Most survey-takers 
fill it out completely.Software programs review the surveys for signs of care-
less responses. Those that appear to be Christmas-treed are thrown out.
Zegler said, to her team’s surprise in 2009, almost all of 
the participants provided valuable, serious responses.
About 20,000 included constructive comments and sug-
gestions in the optional fill-in boxes.
These suggestions have led to changes to peer-adviser 
training and on-campus tutoring opportunities.
“I hope students really do care about their undergraduate 
experience,” Zegler said. “With that many students having an opinion, that’s powerful. It really is.”Most answer SERU seriously, UF officials say

Court won’t look at tuition 
for illegal immigrants 
WASHINGTON — The Su-
preme Court has rejected a chal-
lenge to a California policy that 
gives tuition breaks to illegal im-migrants to attend public colleges 
and universities.
The justices on Monday re-
fused to review a California Su-preme Court ruling that upheld 
a state law giving California high school graduates reduced tuition 
at state schools, regardless of their 
immigration status. The court did not comment on its action.
The law’s challengers say it 
conﬂ  icts with federal immigration law that prohibits post-secondary 
education aid to illegal immi-
grants.
Eleven other states grant simi-
lar beneﬁ  ts to illegal immigrants. They are: Illinois, Kansas, Mary-land, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
New York, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Utah, Washington and Wiscon-sin.

Ohio animal shelter puts fat-
test cats on discount
HILLIARD, Ohio (AP) — A 
central Ohio animal shelter with 
an abundance of chubby cats is 
having a sale on its fattest felines, 
hoping a discount entices poten-tial owners to take one home.
The Capital Area Humane So-
ciety says the fat cats are on sale this summer for $15 each or two for $20, instead of the usual $70 adoption price.
Development manager Mary 
Hiser says the cats packed on the pounds before arriving at the shel-ter, and the extra weight can cause them health problems.Lake City reports Jason West went to Basin Clinic in Vernal on 
May 27 prepared to dispute an 
outstanding $25 bill.
Assistant Vernal Police Chief 
Keith Campbell says that after 
asking staff members whether 
they accepted cash, West dumped 2,500 pennies on the counter and demanded that staff count them.
Campbell says the incident 
upset staff because pennies were strewn about the counter and ﬂ  oor, and West’s action served “no legitimate purpose.”
Police later issued the 38-year-
old West a citation for disorderly conduct. That carries a ﬁ  ne of as much as $140. Or 14,000 pennies.

Cops: Conn. man punched 
self to fake assault 
FARMINGTON, Conn.  — 
Connecticut police say a man 
punched himself in the face, tore 
his shirt and threw his wallet 
and keys in a river to convince police he had been assaulted.
Farmington police said Mon-
day that Daniel Vagnini was ar-rested after reporting that he has been assaulted, then admitting he made up the story.
According to police, the 22-
year-old Farmington man sped through a stop sign and nearly crashed into a car. Police say they later found his car and 
heard Vagnini in the woods. He 
told police he had been drinking in Hartford and was assaulted and blacked out.
Vagnini was charged with 
reckless driving, evading re-sponsibility and driving under the inﬂ  uence.
A woman who returned a 
message left at Vagnini’s home said the family would have no comment.

PUBLIC HEALTH

Gainesville residents exposed 
to the contaminated dust and soil 
from the Cabot-Koppers Superfund site are not at an increased risk for developing cancer, according to an 
analysis by the Florida Department 
of Health.
The study , released Friday , 
compared the number of reported cancer cases in the Stephen Foster neighborhood census tract with the number of expected cases.
The department calculated the 
expected rate by looking at the 
state’s cancer rates as reported by 
the Florida Cancer Data System and census data between 1980 and 2000.
During this 20-year period, there 
were 447 reported cases of cancer in the neighborhoods surrounding the Superfund site — 74 fewer cases than expected.
These results suggest the health 
risks as a result of exposure to the contaminated dust and soil are low, said Anthony Dennis, the environ-mental health director of the Alach-ua County Health Department.
The study looked at 18 types of 
cancer, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and kidney , liver, pancreatic and bladder cancers — the illnesses most commonly as-sociated with contaminated house-
holds. 
Many people have moved in and 
out of the area, making it difficult 
to track people who may have been diagnosed with cancer after moving away and to identify people who may have moved to the area with pre-existing conditions.
The Department of Health will 
conduct a second review once the 2010 census data becomes completely available in the fall.  
This study will include the reported cancer cases from 2000 to 2008.
Dennis said a group is also being 
formed to test homes in the area for dust contaminated with dioxin — a toxic compound often associated with cancer that has been found in the soil near the Cabot-Koppers site.
“We will continue to do soil 
sampling and review data,” he said. “But with what the health depart-
ment knows and the data we’ve 
evaluated, the health risks continue to appear low.”Study: Koppers not 
upping cancer risk

to appear low.”

First it was Mellow Mushroom.
Then it was the ill-fated Anthony’s Wood Fired Pizza.Last week, the restaurant space at 1209 W. University Ave. 
was officially reincarnated as Endzone Gainesville. 
Endzone is a sports bar that screams Gators spirit from in-
side and out.
The orange and blue restaurant highlights everything UF 
from past to present. 
One table is Tim Tebow-themed, and another table features 
every UF president.
Endzone, is a place where everyone can have fun regardless 
of their age, said owner Daniel Myara.
“I’m trying to make a place where people can hang out, eat, 
dance and meet friends,” he said. 
Myara owns a sports bar in Daytona and decided to open a 
new one in Gainesville since his son is a UF student.
The sports bar will be open every day from 11 a.m. until 2 
a.m. 
No cover will be charged to enter.The menu contains typical bar food, including hamburgers, 
hot dogs, salads and sandwiches. 
Endzone also provides a new food challenge for Gainesville. 
Customers can participate in the Gator Cup Burger Challenge. 
If the two-pound burger is finished, the customer will receive a 
T-shirt and a place on the in-house trophy. 
There is also a list of drinks and specials for those who are 
21 and older. Instead of having a specific night like some bars in Gainesville, Myara said there will be specials every night.
“Every night will be our night,” he said.The waitresses are also an integral part of the restaurant’s 
atmosphere, as they are encouraged to dance for and socialize with customers.4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2011

It took only three thrusts of a 
shovel to unearth an archeological 
find 60 years in the making.
UF archeologists have recent-
tly uncovered the remains of a 
300-year-old church in St. Augus-
tine.  Researchers from the Florida Museum of Natural History be-lieve this may be the oldest stone structure from Spanish-Colonial 
Florida. 
The coquina stone and tabby 
foundations show the church was 
at least 90-by-40 feet, making it 
one of the largest churches in colo-
nial Spanish Florida and the only mission church made of stone. 
“This is a truly exciting redis-
covery of a long-lost building,” 
said Kathleen Deagan a research 
curator emeritus of historical ar -
cheology at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
Though officially retired, Dea-
gan still acts as a co-investigator at the Nombre de Dios site.
Being America’s oldest city, 
St. Augustine presents some of 
the nation’s first European settle-
ments, Deagan said. This discov-ery is thought to be a church com-missioned by Florida’s governor 
in 1677.The discovery of the lost docu-
ments that helped pinpoint the 
buried church’s location was something that might come out of an Indiana Jones story. 
The Rev. Charles Spellman was 
the director of the still-active mis-sion in 1951, but he was also an amateur archaeologist, said Gif-ford Waters, collections manager 
for historical archeology at the 
Florida Museum of Natural His-tory. 
Spellman started diagramming 
and digging for the remains of the church, but his records were lost after his death. Waters said while 
moving the Catholic records archive from 
the Mandarin area 
of Jacksonville to St. Augustine, Sister 
Catherine Bitzer found Spellman’s 
long-lost research.
“It was a puzzle to put his clues 
together,” he said. 
But sure enough, Waters hit co-
quina gold with three motions of his shovel. 
“In 1728, it was lost to history,” 
he said. “With Father Spellman, 
in 1951, it was found again and 
was lost to history again until 
his records showed up within the last year. And now, found again a week ago,” Waters said.From the depths of dirt,

Love and spray paint were in the air Sunday 
evening.
Lawrence Griffin, 25, a UF graduate, painted 
a marriage proposal to his girlfriend Miredys 
Gonzales, 25, a graduate from the UF law school, on the 34th Street Wall.
The proposal covered more than 80 feet of the 
wall with stills like a flip-through-sequence in a sketch book. It began with a hummingbird beat-ing its wings as it flew along the wall, and the scene continued with a man slowly bending to his knee.  
In the seven final stills, the man held out a 
ring to a woman in a skirt and high heels with the hummingbird at her feet. The characters were painted in black along the wall, but the scene had as much color as the setting sun could cast.
Later that night, Griffin picked up his girl-
friend, Gonzales, blindfolded her and led her to 
the wall, she said.
When they arrived at the wall, he removed 
her blindfold. 
“He said, ‘Let the zunzún guide you,’” she 
said. Zunzún means hummingbird in Spanish.
When they got to the last still, Griffin knelt 
down and proposed in Spanish, his second lan-
guage and her first. 
She said yes.The two were high school sweethearts and 
had to overcome a language barrier through the beginning of their relationship.
It’s not the first time someone has used the 
wall to propose. This fall, someone painted the entire wall white and painted a simple ‘Will you marry me?’ message in text.
Painting on the 34th Street wall has been a 
time-honored tradition for more than 20 years, said Lt. Steve Weaver of the Gainesville Police 
Department. People use the wall to congratulate, 
commemorate and propose, he said.
Tommy Lonergan, 23, a student at UF, said 
the wall gives character to the city . He doesn’t usually remember what people put on the wall, but when he drove past the wall Sunday he saw Griffin’s proposal and said it really stood out.
“It was simple, and it was something every-
one could understand,” he said.
Not everyone appreciates the artwork of the 
wall on 34th Street, said Mickie MacKenzie, ex-ecutive director of Keep Alachua County Beauti-ful. Some people in the community call the wall an eyesore, and three times a week KACB sends a person out to check the wall for offensive or hateful graffiti. 
MacKenzie isn’t worried about Griffin’s pro-
posal being covered over too soon. In fact, she 
said, she’s excited to see it herself.
“Our position is to keep it respectful,” she 
said. “Other than that, we pretty much leave it 
alone.”Seeing the writing on the wall,

Santa Fe College students will be able to ride designated 
Santa Fe buses to and from campus starting this fall, accord-
ing to a new Florida law.
Santa Fe President Jackson Sasser said the primary pur -
pose of the bus system will not only give students better access to classes, but it will be a safe way for students and faculty to get to work or social outings.
“It’s a win-win for everyone in the area,” he said. 
Santa Fe students will be able to use the buses with their 
student ID. Tuition will increase by less than $3 per credit 
hour to fund the new bus system.
The Santa Fe community has been lobbying for a trans-
portation system for the past 11 years. External Affairs Di-
rector Travis Bennett said he thought the difference this 
time was that the bill proposed to the Florida state Senate applied only to Santa Fe. Previous proposed bills applied to 
all Florida community colleges. Santa Fe students put time 
and effort into getting the bill passed, even testifying during this past spring break.
Gov. Rick Scott approved the law on May 26. The bus system will help accommodate Santa Fe’s grow-
ing student population. Bennett said the last count estimat-ed Santa Fe has 16,000 students. That number is projected to grow to 20,000 in the next year, he said.
Sasser said he was grateful to the lobbyists, politicians 
and members of the UF and Santa Fe communities who sup-
ported the effort to pass the bill. He said the students espe-
cially made a difference.
“[I] couldn’t be prouder of the students who have stepped 
up over these years,” Sasser said.TUESDAY, JUNE 7, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Jack Payne has had a busy sum-
mer.
The Institute of Food and Agri-
cultural Sciences senior vice presi-
dent for agriculture and natural 
resources has named a dean or 
chair for the third time in less than a month. 
A week ago, former Cornell 
University professor and depart-
ment of plant pathology chair -woman Rosemary Loria was cho-
sen to be the new plant pathology 
department chairwoman at UF.
Less than a week later, John 
Hayes, the department chairman 
for wildlife ecology and conser -
vation at UF, will take over as the 
new interim dean for the Institute 
of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
Hayes, 55, has been the chair -
man of the wildlife ecology and 
conservation department since 
2006. He said faculty members are 
in the process of nominating a sub-
stitute to serve as interim chair in his absence, and will take about a 
week to identify a member of the senior faculty. 
Loria, 59, received her doctorate 
from Michigan State University in 1980. She then devoted more than 
30 years to research and teaching at Cornell, where she also served as plant pathology department chairwoman for five years.
“Dr. Rose Loria is extremely 
well qualified for the position,” said Eric Triplett, the outgoing in-terim chairman. “She comes with a great deal of experience. I am confident that she will do a terrific job and will be a great asset to the plant pathology department, IFAS and all of UF.”
In August 2010, Loria was the 
recipient of the Ruth Allen Award, an award that honors those who have made research contributions 
that have changed, or could poten-
tially alter, the course of research being done in the field of plant pa-thology.
As interim dean, Hayes is ex-
pected to earn $193,788 per year. Loria is expected to earn $185,000 per year. 
Hayes said he is looking to 
build on the work of the outgoing 
research dean, Mark McLellan. 
“I want to build on the great 
legacy that he’s created,” Hayes 
said. “And to bring a personal vi-
sion as to how we can move that 
forward.”IFAS announces two more faculty appointments

A UF graduate student was arrested early 
Friday morning for assaulting two men and 
shouting anti-gay slurs at them. 
According to a Gainesville Police re-
port, Matthew Wallace Teper, 22, of 104 SW Eighth St., shouted at two men from across 
the street at 600 SW Second Ave. near down-
town Gainesville.
Teper pulled down his pants and exposed 
himself while shouting anti-gay slurs and suggesting sex acts for the victims to perform on him. He then pulled up his pants, crossed 
the street and continued to shout at the men. 
One of the victims said he told Teper to 
“leave us alone.” The victim said Teper then punched him on the left side of his face. 
When the victim tried to push him off, Teper shoved him to the ground.
The second victim said that when he told 
Teper he would call the police, Teper hit him in the back of the head.
Police said the victims were not seriously 
injured.
Teper was taken to Alachua County Jail. 
He was charged with two counts of battery, and the evidence of prejudice classifies the incident 
as a hate crime, according to the 
police report.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said federal 
privacy laws prevent him from discussing disciplinary actions for a specific student. 
He said the dean of students can bring 
code of conduct charges against a student 
for off-campus behavior. It is protocol to do so when the student is charged with violent 
acts.UF grad student arrested

UF’s Student Senate is expected to 
vote Tuesday night on an election re-
form measure that would allow student government to do away with paper bal-lots and switch to an electronic voting 
system.
The bill, written by Senate President 
Micah Lewis, has been in the works 
for the past few months. It is expected to eliminate issues like double voting, 
which was exposed when three people 
— including ex-senators — publicized their casting of multiple votes in the Spring 2011 elections. They wrote in the name of a historical figure rather than voting for a candidate.  
Unlike electronic elections at other 
universities, which are held online, UF’s 
will still be held at secured on-campus 
locations. Though an online system might seem more convenient, Lewis said, there’s no way to ensure students’ 
votes aren’t being swayed by candidates 
through rewards or peer pressure. 
At a meeting Friday, Lewis said the 
voting locations themselves are current-ly undetermined. Because the new sys-
tem could allow students to vote at any 
polling location, SG would have the flex-ibility to decrease the number of polling locations on campus. 
Senate’s legislative bills only require 
a majority vote to pass.SG elections could 
have electronic voting

Today’s question: Do you want to go to a party in Anthony Weiner’s pants?
153 TOTAL VOTES54% YES46% NOThursday’s question: Would you vote for a Mormon presidential candidate?Star in the Night
When many asked “why?”
RFK asked “why not?”
Monday marked the 38th anniversary of the death 
of Robert Francis Kennedy, the 64th attorney general of the United States and one-time  presi-
dential candidate who was gunned down in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel only hours after locking up the pivotal California Democratic primary. 
For some, the man represents nothing more than anoth-
er political opportunist who used his well-endowed name to climb the highest echelons of the American government. For those who were yelling “no more,” to a war worlds away, vicious racial bigotry and overall social unrest,  Bobby Kennedy represented the country’s best — and last 
— chance at bringing together a nation torn apart by inter -
nal turmoil. In April of that same year, America’s “dream” 
had breathed its last breath on the balcony of a Memphis hotel. Two months and three bullets later, the last handful 
of dirt had been thrown on its grave.
For many students today, the lessons brought forth 
by Robert Kennedy only serve as rustic planks on a dark 
bridge in the American historical narrative, a bridge sel-dom traveled in the mind of the average young adult, that 
connects an era of what could have been with an era of 
what unfortunately was. For most of them, the promises he made to their parents and grandparents appear as hol-low words powerless to the concerns of today’s world, just 
another vision cast into the winds of time.
And therein lies the problem. 
On the surface, today’s America bears little resem-
blance to the America of 1968. Swarms of students do not kick down the doors of administration buildings in protest 
of a country that has betrayed them. Fellow countrymen 
do not immediately resort to drawing blood over the mat-ter of skin color as they did in that year. The battles of then were over America’s heart and soul. Now, it’s mostly over 
her pocketbook. 
But underneath the glossy coating of bite-sized techno-
logical triumphs, Twitter feeds and reality television lies a 
country filled with cracks and tears.
We are still a country that is divided by color. This time, 
the battle is not between black and white; it’s between red and blue. Like then, there is no gray.
We are still a country filled with many who do not 
have enough. This time, it is not just money that they are 
scrambling to obtain; they look for an identity, a purpose, 
a chance, anything to become simply adequate. Like then, “special” just seems out of reach.
We are still a country desperately seeking the light of 
the glory days before. This time, its flicker is more bitter -
sweet. Like then, it doesn’t appear to be returning. 
In a 1964 tribute to his fallen brother, Jack, Bobby Ken-
nedy recounted a line from Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Ju-liet.” “When he shall die,” Kennedy read to the audience, 
“take him and cut him out into stars, and he shall make the 
face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.”
For our country, the sky has never appeared so dark nor 
its winds felt so cold. But if we try to implement Bobby’s vision into our everyday lives, we may make some stars of 
our own, stars that others will not only marvel at, but will 
use as their guiding light to a better world.A ticking time bomb in getting bombed
“I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.” 
J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the creators of 
the first nuclear weapon, deemed this technologi-
cal design worthy of the title of Death, aligned with this 
quotation from a Hindu holy book. He considered the 
atomic bomb to be the equivalent of Shiva, the Hindu god 
of destruction. 
He was wrong.Yes, men created atomic weapons that flatten the Earth, 
turn humans to ash and spread clouds of radiation and dust for miles around. But this unit of destruction, though devastating, loses the efficiency of destruction through cleverness and subtlety. 
And thus, it was inevitable that man brewed alcohol, a 
creation capable of destroying a man from the inside out.
Yes, only lovely ethanol can push a person to piss on 
public property, yell at strangers, fight with loved ones, battle Decepticons naked and insult a police officer all at the same time. It provides the perfect opportunity to rot one’s liver and social status at the same time.
By no means am I bashing alcohol as a substance all on 
its own – trust me, I am a consumer. I am simply address-ing my distaste for a chronic irresponsibility associated 
with alcohol that some people find not only acceptable, 
but defensible. 
Alcohol can be delicious and useful (both for coura-
geous actions and entertaining nights). But when abused, it becomes an absolute nuisance.
People not only manage to act like fools in public while 
intoxicated, but have the audacity to drive around while their reaction time, decision making ability and vision are severely impaired, showing absolutely no concern for the 
well-being of others.
People who consciously drive intoxicated should have 
a limb ripped from their anatomy in a public forum. Or 
better yet, shot right in the f****** head. 
People drive intoxicated for only one of three reasons: 1) They are selfish assholes who 
couldn’t give a shit for the well-being of others. 2) They are f****** stupid, or  3) They are so pathetic that in a situation where there is a real emer -
gency, they are incapable of finding one friend or even acquaintance to help them in a time of need. 
Or maybe it’s all of the above.Again, I stress my hatred for peo-
ple who drive intoxicated. People complain about the limit being too low, but it is based on experimental testing. Yes, individuals have different levels of tolerance, but it would be painfully expensive to test the tolerance of each Ameri-
can citizen. The level is what it is, so you can suck it. 
I personally think the fact that the legal drinking age is 
21 is absolutely absurd, but the level of DUIs and arrests 
for drunken misconduct in America are equally absurd.
These problems result from more of a cultural issue 
than a global issue. Americans place so much negative stigma on the dangers of alcohol instead of encouraging responsibility and moderation. 
In Europe, it is commonplace  to have a drink with each 
meal, but you don’t see Europeans with excessive DUIs. Americans need to place the emphasis on proper training and upbringing, so people know how to responsibly con-sume alcohol rather than blaming the substance itself.
Perhaps with appropriate guidance, Americans can 
recognize alcohol as a godsend when used responsibly and eliminate all this negative stigma attached to it.
On a side note, alcoholism is an absolute joke. Stop 
blaming your issues on “something that is out of your 
control.” Learn some restraint, gain some discipline and 
stop being a pussy.

“Sith, get one of your boys to cross the Mekong. 
Bring back a couple of shopping bags full of pot.”
Sith manages all the Thai civilians who work the mess 
hall. We’re like brothers. 
“I send. You no worry,” he tells me.  I go on. “Tell him only chop the tops off the plants. I’ll 
toss him $5 and pay for the ferry.” 
Thai sticks sell for $20 a pound.  The Thais even empty 
American cigarettes and refill them with marijuana. A pack of 20 sells for $2.
But I want Laotian weed. After two hits, I cough un-
til my testicles hurt. When I stop, the world’s a different place. 
Amazing.        
   n n n
Sitting on the side of my bunk I wonder, “Am I the 
straight guy or the guy who’s high?” 
Wait, that’s schizophrenia. 
“Jose, I’m smoking about 20 joints a day. You think 
that’s too much?”
“Nah.”
 “How much you smoke?”  
“About 40 joints a day. You’re all right man.”
In Nakon Phanom, the “working girls” nickname me 
“Dar Juan.” In English, that’s “Sweet eyes.” A red line shoots permanently across my baby blues.     
   n n n
Six months earlier, I arrive in Bangkok. 
I have a two-night layover before another plane takes 
me into the country.  
I have a cabbie buy me a pound of Thai sticks for $20 
and hit the nightclubs. 
Beneath disco balls and the colored lights that reflect 
off of them, the dance floors are mobbed with women of 
every type, shape and size. 
Mama San has a simple system. Each woman has a 
number. An electronic board above the dance floor dis-plays the numbers 1 through 300. When a girl’s picked, the GI hands Mama San $5 and her light goes out. She’s 
taken.
It’s a meat market.  
I visit “Thai Heaven,” and a few other well-known 
spots, but I don’t leap in. I’m no yokel. I’m 21 and from 
New York. 
   n n nBecause I’m manic, Bangkok hits 
me the way water hits Alka-Seltzer. 
A Bronx-Irish-Catholic kid dropped 
into a world where everything’s in-
toxicating, illicit or illegal, I explode in all directions. 
But my first night, I start slow.
I smoke a bong and head for 
a massage parlor. I hike the long 
stairway, pay Mama San $2.50, then turn down the hall. 
Behind a glass wall sits a bevy of gorgeous, long-haired Thai women, smiling and waving at me, hoping to be se-
lected. 
One blows me away. She’s simply stunning.  
She leads me by my hand to her spotless cubicle. On 
the left is a massage table dressed with clean white linen. 
On the right there’s a bathtub. 
At first, she wears Hooters-type shorts. Later, she’s 
only wearing thin bikini panties and a bra. After undress-
ing me, she submerges me into a hot bath.
She scrubs every inch. Her expert hands roam between 
my toes and into places previously familiar to my fingers alone. Between the hot water, the wash and the weed, my muscles await her magic.  
After the bath, she towel pats me dry. She lays me on 
the operating table and goes to work.  She walks on my back, bends me backward and takes stress out of my neck, shoulders and body.
After, she asks,“Ow chuck wow?”  “OK,” I reply. 
“Chuck wow” means “happy ending.” She rubs Vase-
line across her palms and finishes me off. She rewashes 
me with a hot cloth, and then rubs me down with talcum powder. 
My $2.50 spent, I could slide under a closed door. Mas-
sage parlors become a daily ritual and a harbinger of my insatiable appetite.  
n n n
                I receive few letters. A neighborhood girl writes once a 
month. Her father, Bob, though 20 years older, is a friend who’s caught up in the 1960s. She asks if I could ship some 
grass to the Bronx.
I think about it briefly and weigh the dangers. 
Sending drugs through the U.S. mail is a felony. Leav-
enworth is not a pleasant thought.
How to do it safely? No return address is a given. What about dogs smelling packages? Mothballs? 
How to say “camphor” in Thai? 
n n nIt takes a week. The camphor cost $25.00, the grass 
$1.50.    
I wrap the pot in plastic bags and then rewrap those 
bags in camphor.
What if they bust Bob picking up the package?
I tape a piece of loose-leaf paper to the inside plastic 
bag that reads, “I’m sending you a surprise.” With a law-
yer’s help, Bob can plead ignorance. 
After the package goes through, my mania kicks in. 
I deliberate going into business. I have access to opium, 
amphetamines, barbiturates and even heroin. One pack-age of pure heroin could either set me up or put me away 
for life. 
That stops me. The real problem would arise if the 
package got through.
Who would a 22-year-old kid sell that much heroin to 
and not buy a bullet behind the ear?  
n n n
I send one other package abroad. A friend writes me. 
He needs money to get back to the States.
I send a kilo of Laotian weed to London. 
Selling the kilo by the joint allows Joey to spend six 
more months in Europe partying.    
   
n n n
      I learn Thai, but feign ignorance. I want to know what 
the whores are saying.
Once the girls realize I speak the language, their fees 
go to $3.00. I negotiate myself into several bouts of gon-orrhea. I’m at the infirmary so often, the doctors think I work there. 
n n n
After payday, I’m glued to the poker tables. Separating 
the suckers from their paychecks takes four days.  Some novices sit in my $1 to $10 game with a chart indicating whether a flush beats a straight, so I rape them.
A honed gambler, I fill shoe boxes with cash.  
n n n
Everything’s wonderful, until the single most unfor -
gettable day of my life.

Above, Arellano picks ferns at a fern farm in Pierson, which is near Ocala. Moving clockwise: Leftovers 
of rompope, a Mexican drink drunk at Christmas that is similar to eggnog, sit in Arellano’s kitchen; Arel-lano comes inside her house after feeding the chickens before the family awakens; Arellano makes din -
ner with the help of her daughter, Olga, who makes tortillas from scratch; Arellano looks on at her family gathered outside her house; Arellano drives to the local farmers’ market early on a Saturday morning to buy some chickens with Christopher, 7, one of her grandsons; While her son and his friend try to jump-start the car, Arellano chats with her neighbor’s daughter, Alicia.

 After advancing to the Super Regionals for the third straight 
season, Alex Panteliodis was grinning ear-to-ear, swollen with 
“Gator Swag.”
  In a brief moment of uncensored candor, Florida’s junior lefty stated exactly why he — and possibly the entire team — relishes 
the opportunity to play Miami. 
  “I don’t really like those guys,” he said emphatically of the 
Hurricanes. “They always come out there and boost my ego.”
L  ately, the ‘Canes don’t seem to take as much delight. For the 
third straight postseason, Florida torpedoed Miami’s season. 
  The No. 2 national seed swept the Gainesville Regional over 
the weekend. The Gators thrashed Manhattan on Friday and 
then dismantled UM over the next two days, including an 11-4 
win Sunday to send Florida to a Super Regional matchup against  Gators roll to Super Regionals berth

After capturing a Southeastern 
Conference championship and its most tournament wins since 2004, 
the Florida men’s golf team again 
ﬁ  zzled out when it mattered most. 
The No. 6 Gators shot a com-
bined 44-over through three rounds 
at the NCAA Championships to ﬁ  n-
ish 23rd, 15 spots out of the match-play portion.
“I think we got so caught up in 
the possibilities 
that we forgot 
to play golf,” UF coach Buddy Al-
exander said.  “It’s disappointing 
because we are a lot better team 
than we showed.” 
Yet again, Florida failed to ad-
vance to match play after entering the NCAAs as a favorite. Augusta 
State defeated Georgia 3-2 to win a 
second consecutive title.
Senior Bank Vongvanij, who 
was named a PING First-Team All- 
American on Monday, ﬁ  nished his career at UF with a 13th-place show-
ing after closing with a 1-under 71. 
“We’ve had a good year and you 
don’t want to let one tournament 
diminish what you’ve done all sea-
son long,” Alexander said. “From 
that standpoint, I’m proud of these kids.”

UF TRACK AND FIELD
  By JOHN BOOTHE
 Alligator Writer
   
 Going into the NCAA Outdoor Cham-
pionships, UF coach Mike Holloway has 
tried to make the Gators focus on one 
thing: themselves.
  From June 8-11 in Des Moines, Iowa, 
the No. 2 Florida men’s team has the op-portunity to become just the fourth team 
to sweep both NCAA track and ﬁ  eld championships after winning the indoor 
title in February.
  UF was in the same 
position last year, but 
fell by a single point to Texas A&M in the ﬁ  nal 
meet.
  “We’re just go-
ing to go in there and 
take care of Florida,” 
Holloway said. “The mistake that a lot of people make is we’re sitting around 
going Texas A&M has this and Florida 
State’s got that. But my job is to coach 
Florida, and I think everyone getting on the plane has a chance to score.”
  With 17 chances to put points on the 
board on the men’s side — four more 
than last season — the Gators have al-
ready put themselves in a better posi-tion.Florida zoned in with  ﬁ  nals looming

   Florida junior Alex Panteliodis tossed 6.2 solid innings in the Gators’ 11-4 win over Miami on Sunday. In the postgame press conference, the southpaw was candid about his feelings toward the Hurricanes, saying they give him an extra spark.

Rosa Taveras / Alligator StaffTucker named MVP of Gainesville Regional after monster weekend 
Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi 
State. 
The Gators again eliminated the ‘Canes 
backed by déjà vu performances from Pan-teliodis and Preston Tucker.
After years where UM frequently ruined 
UF’s season, the Gators have returned the 
favor. Florida has swept all six postseason 
meetings the past three years, winning 11 of the last 12 games overall. 
“They’ve played very good against us,” 
‘Canes coach Jim Morris said. “There for 
a while, we did eliminate Florida a lot of 
times. They’re getting even right now. … I hope it flip-flops again very soon.”
A year after Panteliodis tossed a com-
plete game, 12 strikeout, three-hitter over Miami, the husky southpaw dominated the 
‘Canes again on Sunday. The junior tossed a 
season-high 6.2 innings, punching out four while scattering five hits. 
After laboring with consistency earlier 
this season, Panteliodis has pitched 12 post-
season innings while allowing just a single 
run. 
“Something sparks me against them,” 
the All-Regional performer said. “It fires me 
up. … I just go out there and give it all I’ve 
got.”
In his last three starts against the Hurri-
canes, the lefty is 3-0 with a 1.71 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 24-to-3.
“He can really pitch,” Morris said. “He’s 
really talented. He did a super job.”
Panteliodis was backed by tremendous 
run support as his teammates established an 11-run lead after just 2½ innings. Preston 
Tucker unloaded a three-run homer in the 
first inning, ambushing a first-pitch fastball for a towering shot over the foul pole in right. 
The junior was named the Gainesville 
Regional MVP after collect-ing six extra-base hits and 11 RBIs in three games.
“He knew going into 
the weekend that without Austin [Maddox] and Brian [Johnson] he needed to step 
up,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He did that. I’m awfully proud of the way he 
handled that and was able to deliver.”
Tucker unloaded a trio of bombs during 
the regional, tying a school-record for post-
season round-trippers.“I’m just barreling balls up,” he said. 
“Whenever I see an opportunity, I’m trying to drive in runs.”
As a freshman two years ago, Tucker was 
also named regional MVP after battering pitching — mostly Miami’s — for nine hits, including a pair of dingers and six RBIs.
“He’s an outstanding player, goodness 
gracious,” Morris said. “He always plays good against us. I don’t know what he’s hitting against us, but it seems like .900 or something.”
Tucker (2 for 4, five RBIs on Sunday) led 
UF’s eight-run explosion in the third. The Gators sent 13 to the plate, tallying six hits including run-scoring knocks from Tyler Thompson (All-Regional left fielder), Daniel 
Pigott (All-Regional designated hitter), Vick-
ash Ramjit (3 for 4, one RBI) and Tucker.BASEBALL , from page 14
Demps, Taylor 
and Claye vying for multiple titles 
“We’ve won national titles with numbers 
that we’ve had and to have extra people it only 
makes things better and you can only look up 
and be extremely optimistic about the possi-
bilities,” jumper Christian Taylor said.
The No. 17 women’s team will also be com-
peting and has nine slots filled for the cham-pionships — the same number it had in 2010 
when it finished in third.
 Heading into the meet, Holloway said he’s 
realistic with which athletes can win and those 
who will just score. But Florida’s coach expects 
at least Jeff Demps, Will Claye and Taylor to 
compete for individual titles.
“It’s a blessing, and it shows the kind of tal-
ent we have on this team,” Holloway said.TRACK , from page 142011 NCAA OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS PREVIEW
With 24 Gators athletes set to compete for 26 scoring opportunities 
at the 2011 NCAA Outdoor Championships, Florida aims for a season 
sweep of the men’s titles and a strong finish from the women’s team in 
Des Moines, Iowa from June 8-11.
How will UF’s athletes fare at competing in multiple events?  
Eight Gators will have to balance competing in both relay and individual 
events during the four-day meet. Jumper Christian Taylor qualified for both the triple and long jump, along with running two legs in the 4x100 and 
4x400 relays. UF coach Mike Holloway said bouncing between events is 
something his athletes have grown accustom to since high school. “You go 
to a high school state meet and they run five events in a five-hour period,” 
he said. “So to take them to a meet and say, ‘Do two in a day,’ all of a sud -
den everyone says, ‘Oh my God, they must be tired.’ We don’t worry about that, everything they’re doing they’re trained and prepared for.”
Will Florida’s freshmen women continue to have an impact?  
With only nine scoring opportunities in Des Moines for the No. 17 wom -
en’s team, points will be at a premium. Four of those chances will hinge on freshmen athletes who qualified with top-12 times and distances but 
will need top-eight results at nationals to contribute to UF’s points total. 
Freshman distance runner Cory McGee is making her second champion-
ship appearance after finishing 10th in the women’s mile at the NCAA 
Indoor meet. “I definitely do want to have a better national championship experience than indoors,” she said. “I did learn a lot, I think throughout 
cross country and indoors you’re building to this moment. The outdoor 
championship is really the biggest part of it all.”
Without Omar Craddock, can the Gators still extend their streak?  
Florida will be missing one piece of its heralded triple jump trio after 
Craddock failed to qualify, but the men's team still has juniors Will Claye and Taylor, who own the top two marks of the season.
The last five NCAA individual triple jump titles have been won by ath -
letes currently on UF’s roster as Taylor won last year and Claye got the 
victory in 2009 as a member of Oklahoma.Baseball

Gators will look to rebound tonight in Game 2 at 8 p.m. on ESPN2 
Florida’s frustration led to uncharacteristic 
errors going forward.
Hannah Rogers — who walked a career-high 
eight batters against ASU on Friday night — 
walked two and gave up an unearned run in the 
first when Michelle Moultrie botched a ground-
er in center, her first error since last season’s 
WCWS. Instead of maintaining her composure, things fell completely to pieces for the freshman 
All-American in the second. 
With two outs and a runner on second, Rog-
ers was ordered to intentionally walk Sun Dev-
ils lead-off hitter Katelyn Boyd in order to face Lesley Rogers — Arizona State’s hits leader at 
the WCWS entering Monday. The center fielder 
walked to start a three-batter offensive rampage. 
Kaylyn Castillo and Annie Lockwood hit back-to-back RBI singles before senior Krista Donnen-wirth cleared the bases with a blast to the left-
field bleachers at ASA Hall of Fame Stadium.
“We wanted to come out and prove a point 
that we had a great offense,” ASU’s five-hole 
hitter Donnenwirth said.
The aftermath was a 7-0 UF deficit — shock-
ing for a team that had defeated its opponents by a total score of 30-6 since Friday night’s 6-5 loss to ASU.
Stephanie Brombacher made a 3.2-inning 
relief appearance, bailing Rogers out of a night-mare, but also exposing Florida’s only other pitching option with two possible games left.
Arizona State’s Nos. 3-4-5 hitters went a com -
bined 7 for 10 with three round-trippers and 10 RBIs. It was the team’s highest run total since a March 5 win over New Mexico State.
Offensively, the Gators appeared to regress 
from any adjustments they might have made against Sun Devils freshman phenom Dallas Es-cobedo — who pitched a complete game, allow-
ing five hits and striking out seven.
Florida popped up Escobedo’s hazardous 
rise-ball eight times — four landed in the glove 
of an infielder.
Overall, the Gators once again strayed away 
from the run manufacturing principle that has gotten them through the postseason. They stranded the only three base runners they were able to advance into scoring position.
“We’ll spend time reevaluating our situation, 
trying to get everybody on board to be commit -
ted and be as positive as we possibly can,” Wal-ton said. For Florida, a chance for revenge will come in Tuesday night at 8 p.m.  on ESPN2.SOFTBALL , from page 1

Freshman Hannah Rogers started Monday’s game but was roughed up for nine 
earned runs on nine hits and exited after just 2.1 innings of work.
Runs: Florida has scored 41 
runs in ﬁ  ve WCWS games. The other seven teams in Oklahoma City have combined to score 41 runs. The Gators are averaging 8.2 runs per game. The Sun Devils are second at 4.3. Sunday, Florida tied the single-game WCWS run record with 16, broke the single-inning run record with 11 in the ﬁ  rst and scored more runs on Alabama than any team ever has.So much for Gators small-ball
Experts say 
pitching is the 
most important 
attribute at the 
Women’s College 
World Series. The 
Gators might be 
changing some 
philosophies.Michelle 
Moultrie: The junior is batting .611 in the WCWS with 
three home runs, 
compared to the two homers she hit all season. Moultrie leads the WCWS in hits, long-balls and total bases. As a whole, the Nos. 1-6 slots in the UF lineup are hitting a combined .413.Power: Florida has hit 11 round-trippers including 
a team home run cycle in Sunday’s 16-2 win over Ala-bama. The second highest total is Arizona State at four.
Base runners: When UF batters walk, they celebrate by saluting the dugout. The Gators have saluted 25 times in OKC  –  seven more than the Sun Devils and 18 more than the third-place Crimson Tide. Teams have pitched around Kelsey Bruder, walking her eight times. After seeing 12 balls in Game 1 on Sunday, she 
homered on the ﬁ  rst pitch she saw in Game 2. The next pitch she faced hit her.Moultrie
