With Gov. Rick Scott’s push to keep tuition low, his 
“Finish in Four” plan would keep the price the same 
throughout students’ ﬁ  rst four years of college.
“Finish In Four” is an incentive for 
students to graduate in four years to 
take advantage of the guaranteed tuition 
rate. The plan would begin for students entering a state university in the upcom-ing Fall semester.
Chris Moran, director of communica-
tions for the Ofﬁ  ce of University Rela-tions, said he did not know if this plan would include current students at UF.
According to Scott’s 2013-2014 budget, students who 
entered college in the 2009-2010 Fall semester have seen tuition rise an average of 13 percent each year. With this proposal, students and families could budget the cost of higher education more effectively.Scott proposes

Sister Hazel will perform in an hourlong show at 11 
a.m. at the Street-Side Studio in Weimer Hall.
“The Conversation” radio segment on Florida’s 89.1 
WUFT-FM will host the show.
Sister Hazel members Ken Block and Drew Copeland 
will perform in the studio, and students can watch from 
outside. They will also answer questions.
Block said they will perform one or two songs from 
their new album, which is expected to debut this year. They will also perform some of their radio hits like “All For You” and “Change Your Mind.”
“It’s always nice to come back here and plug in when-
ever we can,” he said.
“The Conversation” will ﬁ  rst air Feb. 21. 
A recording of the show with Sister Hazel will air 
March 21.“The Conversation” was started by Kyle Rothenberg, 
a 23-year-old second-year mass communication graduate 
student, as a master’s project.
Rothenberg, the show’s host, said it is about local is-
sues, happenings and stories from local voices from North and Central Florida.
Mike Gillespie, a 23-year-old ﬁ  rst-year multimedia 
journalism graduate student, is a producer on the show.
“We felt it would be a tremendous opportunity to have 
them come into our very new Street-Side Studio to per-form a concert here on the same campus that they gradu-ated on,” he said.Gainesville’s Sister Hazel to visit, perform in Weimer Hall

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-
tion Commission plans to save about two 
dozen native species, and it is asking the public for input.
The plans call for the public to comment 
on a suggested list on the commission’s website of 23 out of 60 species of animals that are planned to be protected across the state based on similarities in conservation methods.
Claire Sunquist, a stakeholder coordina-
tor for the Imperiled Species Management 
Program, said the project will be an ongoing 
experiment.
“We’re thinking of these species action plans as living documents that we can edit year to year as we get new information as opposed to having to go back to the com-mission every time we have a new edit,” she said.
Sunquist said the comment section will 
be open until March 13. Then, the FWC team will begin to edit the plans to reﬂ  ect the comments.
The remaining 37 species will be avail-
able for comment in the spring and later in the summer.The ultimate goal, Sunquist said, is to 
present these edited documents to state commissioners in 2015.
If the plans are approved, they will 
change the listing status of some endan-
gered species.
The 23 species available for comment are 
11 birds, ﬁ  ve ﬁ  sh, four mammals, two rep-
tiles and one amphibian, according to an FWC news release.

For a long time, scooters have been a 
staple at UF as an alternative to riding the 
bus or driving to campus.
However, that trend is in transition, 
partly because scooters may not be as green as students once believed.
“Over the past three years, we’re selling 
fewer decals,” said Scott Fox, director of UF’s Transportation and Parking Services.
Fox said the slight decline resulted from 
deliberate efforts by the office to reduce environmentally harmful emissions.
After conducting surveys to understand 
scooter riders’ feelings toward the decals, the office identified two major findings that led them to raise prices, Fox said.
The survey found that if decal prices 
increased, students would ride the bus instead. From 2010 to 2011, the full-year decal price increased from $96 to $144, ac-cording to Alligator archives. 
This year, the decal costs $150 a year 
and $75 a semester, which is the same for all other student decals.
The survey also revealed that about 
70 percent of students made more than six trips around campus on their scooters daily.
Based on the survey results, the office confirmed that scooters might not substan-tially aid sustainability efforts.
In the 2009-2010 school year, 2,104 stu-
dents purchased decals. In 2010-2011, the 
number fell to 2,038. In 2011-2012, the 
number dropped slightly to 2,027.Fox said he believes the numbers will 
continue to decline slightly.
While students at UF may be rid-
ing scooters less, it appears that more 
Gainesville residents are jumping on the 
bandwagon.Collin Austin, owner of New Scooters 
4 Less, 118 NW 14th Ave., has seen more nonstudents purchasing scooters to drive 
around Gainesville.
“In 2011, we expanded our customer 
demographics to include non-students 
daily drivers by acquiring the number one scooter brand in the world, Vespa,” Austin wrote in an email. 
He said the brand attracts more com-
muters to purchase scooters.
Fox said one reason more students are 
declining to ride scooters is due to the in-creased Gainesville Regional Transit Sys-
tem services.
He said that with more buses and stop 
locations added during the past few years, 
students are inclined to use RTS to get around.
However, Samantha Salud had the op-
posite impression.
“I actually imagined that scooter decal 
sales would be rising,” said the 19-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiol-
ogy sophomore.
Salud said she uses her scooter to get 
to campus for class and cheerleading prac-
tices.
“It’s really convenient, and it’s a lot 
easier than waiting for the bus or trying 
to find parking,” she said. “I’m definitely 
getting a decal for the next few years.”

Since the 2009-2010 school year, the number of on-campus scooter decals bought 
dropped by about 4 percent, according to UF’s Transportation and Parking Services.

Although many universities na-
tionwide are not coping well with 
higher-education funding cuts, UF tends to roll with the punches.
Nationally, students are drop-
ping out of school and being left 
to swim in debt, according to The 
American Dream 2.0, a report re-leased last month by a group of 
college presidents, civil rights 
leaders and advocates.It also said 46 percent of Ameri-
can college students don’t finish any credential within six years.
But UF spokesman Steve Orlan-
do said UF has reacted well to the 
state funding cuts.
The freshman retention rate at 
UF is 96 percent, and 83 percent of students graduate with a degree 
within six years, Orlando said.
“We keep students by starting 
off with great students,” he add-
ed.
He attributed much of UF’s 
success in student retention and 
graduation to the Office of Under -
graduate Admissions.
“With about 29,000 applica-tions and only 6,400 slots, there is no way we wouldn’t get the best students possible,” Orlando said.
He said the reason UF students 
accumulate less debt than students 
at other public universities is be-
cause UF’s tuition is lower than the national average. Students also 
have Florida Bright Futures and 
Florida Prepaid scholarships that 
decrease the need for financial aid.
Jonathan Thomas, a 21-year-old 
UF computer engineering junior, 
received financial aid, which en-
abled him to study without rack-
ing up debt.
“If I were to drop out of UF for 
any reason, it would be because of the rigorous coursework, not debt,” Thomas said.
Orlando said UF advisers and 
faculty members try their best to accommodate students financially.
“We would 
never want the lack of monetary 
funds to hold 
students back 
from getting 
what they have 
worked so hard 
to obtain,” he 
said.
Vanessa Grimaldi, a 20-year-
old UF finance sophomore, spoke about how friendly Daniel Schieltz, a financial aid adviser, was when 
she sought financial help.
“He really listened to my issues 
and helped me out as much as pos-sible,” Grimaldi said.
Orlando stressed that UF will 
do a lot for students to get the aid they need — including lay off fac-
ulty members.
He said that UF has been very 
good at allocating its resources so 
that students don’t graduate with 
large debts.
“There is a reason why the na-
tional average of university stu-
dents that graduate with debt is two-thirds, whereas at UF it is only 
one-third,” he said.UF students transcend national average retention rate

This year’s Bateman Team hit 
the ground running with its balloon launch Tuesday on the North Lawn.
During February, the team mem-
bers are promoting a bullying pre-
vention campaign, which includes a plan to educate the Gainesville com-munity about the definition of bully-ing and its long-term and short-term effects.Tuesday , students painted their 
bodies with hurtful words in black paint and stood by 100 orange bal-loons, each of which represented 1,600 students — a total of 160,000 — in the U.S. that choose not to go to school each day because they fear being bullied.
The campaign was created by 
five public relations seniors from UF’s College of Journalism and Communications as part of the Public Relations Student Society of America’s national, annual Bateman Case Study Competition. UF’s team is working with the Gainesville-based  River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding. 
“We hope students are encour -
aged to talk about the instances they’ve experienced or the times they’ve seen others being bullied and use that as a way of them em-powering others to share their sto-ries, share their struggles and stand up together against bullying,” said Bateman Team member Karla Co-breiro.
Nikki Runion, 20, a UF fam-
ily youth and community sciences sophomore, said she is helping the Bateman Team with its mentoring program because she has witnessed bullying in her life and likes to stand up for people. 
The “Spot it, Stop it … Bullying 
Hurts Everyone!” campaign for bul-ly prevention has been in the works since September.
“There are a lot of events we’ll 
be having throughout the month,” said Bateman Team member Claire Miller, 21. “We really hope that the Gainesville community takes ad-vantage of everything we’re plan-ning and have to offer.”
the Homosassa shrew — a small 
mammal — are two species on the list that are native to the Gainesville area.
The FWC tried to make the docu-
ment more inclusive, reducing the plans from the traditional 300 pages down to about 25-30, Sunquist said.
“We’re looking for not just subject 
matter experts and species experts but also partners,” she said, “like our na-tional parks, other universities, non-profits, nongovernmental organiza-tions, local landowners, private land owners and anyone who could poten-tially be affected by these plans and/or who is interested in them.”Andrew Chen, a 19-year-old UF 
digital arts and sciences freshman and member of the UF Wildlife So-ciety, said he supports the commis-sion’s plan to collect feedback from the public.
“It’s very nice that they have a 
website to gather public opinion,” he 
said.
Sunquist said she’s confident about 
pioneering the program, which she 
said is the first of its kind.
“We use the analogy that we’re 
building the airplane and flying it at the same time,” she said. “We are try-ing to be as progressive and inclusive as possible in trying to reduce the 
amount of work for multiple people.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2013

AnimALs , from page 1Two species are area nativesUF’s graduation rate is 65 percent
Moran said the university is still waiting on 
further details, but UF has always encouraged 
students to finish in four years.
“We don’t know enough to say yet whether 
we think it will work,” he said. “It’s interesting 
and worthy of discussion — we all want stu-
dents to graduate on time.”
The university could also extend the plan for 
degrees that may take longer than four years to complete.
In the last 10 years, UF has gone from less 
than 50 percent of students graduating in four years to about 65 percent, he said.
“Our response up to now has been to give 
students support to help them succeed,” he said. “I don’t know if the administration has decided it’s another tool that we would be in-terested in or not.”
Moran said this could also free up space in the university for other students.
Melissa Hill, an 18-year-old UF exploratory 
freshman, said this won’t push her to graduate on time.
She said she would rather spend the extra 
money on a fifth year to find a degree that makes her happy than graduate on time with a degree she doesn’t love.
Nikki Gregory, an 18-year-old UF animal 
sciences freshman, said she’s motivated to 
graduate on time and does not need the extra 
incentive.
“But it’s nice to know it’s there,” she said.Contact Alexa Volland at avolland@alligator.

Changes to the Student 
Government election codes 
will not be made this Spring.
The 700 Codes Fairness and 
Transparency Act has been 
through a rough time in the 
Student Senate. The bill has been tabled, mistakenly left out of the agenda for a meeting and — finally — tabled indefinitely at Tuesday’s Senate meeting.
The bill, penned by Sen. 
Morgan V ollrath, strikes out all campaigning timeframes. Voll-
rath added stronger language 
to the bill to hold individuals and political parties more ac-countable for campaign viola-tions.
Sen. Cory Yeffet objected to 
the bill and motioned to table it 
indefinitely, 
which was 
approved.
D u r i n g 
public de-
bate, Yeffet said because the changes wouldn’t go into effect 
until Fall, the Senate should have more time to completely reform the codes.
“We have plenty of time to 
look at this through a biparti-san effort,” he told the Senate.
Yeffet said the bill was not 
bipartisan. He thanked Sen-ate President Christina Bonar -
rigo for forming the temporary committee on election reform.
Sen. Matt Pesek argued the 
election codes, specifically the time limits on campaigning, went against the U.S. Constitu-tion.
“Unfortunately , the ugly 
failure of bipartisanship has 
reared its ugly head again,” 
he said. “There should be 100 percent approval for Sen. Voll-rath’s bill.”
Bonarrigo said about 11 
senators will be in the newly formed election reform com-mittee. 
It will meet Sunday.

Gainesville Fire Rescue responded 
to two building fires in the same apart-
ment complex hours apart Tuesday.
Firefighters first responded to a call 
Tuesday morning from an eight-unit 
apartment complex located at 635 SW 
11th Lane and found a fire in the down-stairs laundry room that had already been extinguished.
About two hours later, while a GFR 
investigator examined the laundry room, another fire broke out, this time in an upstairs unit.
At 10:49 a.m., firefighters returned to 
the apartment complex and contained the fire to one room. The fire damaged a mattress and clothing, said GFR act-ing Lt. Nick Gonzalez.
No one was inside the apartment, he 
said, and no one was injured.
GFR District Chief Richard Sauls-
berry said the unit’s tenant was being evicted and hadn’t moved out yet. He added the department has not deter -
mined the cause of the fires or if the in-cidents were connected.
Resident Gina Davis called the fire 
department when she smelled smoke 
wafting through the hallway of her 
bottom-story apartment.
Davis, 46, said her cousin woke her 
up to talk about the smell.
“The odor was so strong,” she said.After firefighters cleared the scene 
for the first fire, Davis went back into her apartment until she had to dash outside again when a fire inspector 
evacuated the building.Two fires burn in complex

Plans to expand a Gainesville fire station 
onto a downtown business complex’s parking 
lot have some owners worried customers will 
be driven away.
The city’s search for a place to rebuild the 
50-year-old Gainesville Fire Rescue Station at 427 S. Main St. has finally rested on a location 
that will displace customer parking for several 
small businesses.
The city proposed to buy a parking lot and 
adjacent property to give the new fire station room to spread across the street.
It negotiated terms Thursday to lift the 
four-year lease on the property and move 
forward with construction, said Christopher 
Fillie, developer for the neighboring strip that houses the Citizens Co-op, Civic Media Center 
and other small businesses. 
The businesses share a complex and court-
yard in the 400 block of South Main Street as well as the coveted parking lot across the street 
on Southeast Fifth Avenue — an area already 
notorious for scarce parking.
Sitting on an L-shaped, three-fourths-acre 
parcel that wraps around the Citizens Co-op strip, the fire station feels the squeeze, too. It needs more room to accommodate modern-ized fire trucks and other equipment, said Gainesville Fire Chief Gene Prince.
But public safety is not the only issue at 
stake.Emily Sparr, a Civic Media Center co-co-
ordinator, said she was concerned with cus-tomers lacking a place to park during the fire 
station construction, which she said could lead 
her business to fold.“The fire station is on the other side of our 
property already and is a great, great neigh-bor,” she said. “It’s just, we’re really worried 
about parking and keeping our businesses 
open.”
Prince said the planned expansion is a re-
sponse to the growth connected to the Inno-vation Square district, which is projected to 
grow 5.5 million square feet in the next 10 to 
15 years.
Many of the planned buildings are high 
rises, he said, which require larger trucks and different types of fire-fighting equipment the 
South Main Street station can’t facilitate.
“We really have to look at the service level 
we’re going to have to provide in the down-
town area as we move forward,” Prince said.
Gretchen McIntyre, general manager of 
Citizens Co-op grocery store, said she met with representatives from the city and other 
development organizations Tuesday to solid-
ify a compromise.
McIntyre said as part of the development 
terms, fire station construction is on hold un-til October 2014. The city will then demolish 
two buildings on the block and begin building 
the new fire station. It also agreed to accom-
modate parking of the businesses during con-
struction, she said.
“If the city and the fire station sticks to its 
promises,” she said, “it will work out well for everybody.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A panel discussed the politics 
and history of Gainesville’s Cabot-
Koppers Superfund site Tuesday afternoon during a public meeting at Santa Fe College.
The Democracy Commitment at 
Santa Fe College and the Sustain-able Santa Fe Committee hosted the event that about 25 people attended in the SFC Fine Arts Hall lobby.
The panel consisted of Donna 
Waller, a SFC political science pro-fessor; John Mousa, environmental programs manager for the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department; and Rick Hutton, supervising utility engineer for Gainesville Regional Utilities.
Vilma Fuentes, SFC assistant 
vice president of academic affairs, moderated the discussion, which explained how wood-treating chemicals contaminated the soil and groundwater on the site, which is north of Northwest 23rd Av-enue.
Waller, who moved to Gainesville in 1980, talked about living close to the site and how the contamination affected her neigh-borhood.
Mousa and Hutton gave a pre-
sentation of the pollution around the site and discussed cleanup plans, estimated at $90 million. 
The panel also talked about how 
activism throughout the commu-nity, with the help of local govern-ment, led to the closing of the facili-ties.
“We’re fortunate that we have 
commitment from our local gov-ernment to be able to remediate this situation because most communi-ties in the U.S. aren’t able to have that commitment,” Mousa said.
The panel discussion concluded 
with a Q-and-A session with the audience. One person asked about the spread of water contamination, and another asked if students at Stephen Foster Elementary School, situated several miles northwest of the site, were at risk.
Mousa said the primary concern 
is the water contamination, not pol-lution spreading through the air.
On Friday, SFC will host a re-
lated art exhibit, “Region 4: Trans-formation through Imagination,” in the M147 Santa Fe Art Gallery on campus.
The exhibit is free to the public 
and will end March 28.

A UF center is offering a new course 
that targets professionals in the architec-
ture, engineering and construction in-dustries who are looking to expand their education.
The Training, Research & Education 
for Environmental Occupations center will provide a two-day course, Introduc-tion to Building Energy Modeling, which will help professionals minimize energy use in buildings.
“It’s meant to be an intense, com-
pressed course to get this information to the students,” said Charles J. Kibert, di-
rector of the Powell Center for Construc-
tion and Environment.
Although the course is targeted at 
professionals, Laurel Brown, the mar -keting and program coordinator for the center, said UF architecture, engineering and construction graduate students may 
also benefit from the course and will not 
be excluded from registering.
The course is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. March 5 and 6. It includes a lec-ture portion and a hands-on workshop, which will allow participants to use the models in professional practice.
“The idea is to simulate a building’s 
operation and how much energy it will 
use before you build it,” he said.
During the course, participants will 
try different combinations to minimize 
energy use including components such as lighting, control systems and heating and cooling systems, Kibert said.             
This course will fulfill one of the 
four course requirements necessary to become a certified sustainable building 
analyst. To become an analyst, partici-
pants must take two additional two-day courses.UF offers energy course ANDREW KAYS

Mercury overaccumulation in seafood is the 
focus of a report recently released by Interna-
tional POPs Elimination Network and the Bio-diversity Research Institute.
The January study found that a large vari-
ety of fish from around the world contain high levels of toxic methylmercury that exceed stan-dards set by the U.S. Federal Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Steven Otwell, a UF food science and hu-
man nutrition professor and seafood extension specialist for the Institute of Food and Agricul-ture Sciences, said most seafood is safe to eat, 
but eating large quantities of fish with high 
mercury levels can be dangerous.
“The benefits far exceed the risks of con-
suming most seafoods, and they do so in a mat-ter of weeks or months instead of the decades mercury might take,” he said.
The report found that fish from nine coun-
tries contained mercury levels that would be unhealthy for consumers who follow FDA 
safety guidelines.
Mercury accumulation in fish is a well-known problem, especially in Florida, Otwell 
said.
Trina Vielhauer, deputy director of Florida’s 
Department of Environmental Protection’s Di-vision of Environmental Assessment and Res-toration, said Florida’s mercury issues stem from weather systems that collect mercury pol-lution from around the world and deposit it in the state’s water system.
Vielhauer said her agency 
monitors human and ani-
mal populations near areas 
that have high mercury lev-els. While water treatment plants know to monitor mer -
cury levels, there is no way to effectively clean mercury-
polluted water, she said.
The Everglades’ largely 
landlocked location makes it one of the prima-
ry areas of concern. The region’s sluggish water 
doesn’t move the mercury out of the environ-ment efficiently, and it allows for buildup in not just the aquatic species but also their preda-tors, Otwell said.
He added that without a way to reduce mer -
cury’s presence in sensitive areas, the problem will only magnify.Report finds mercury in seafood

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you have a scooter?
The results of Tuesday’s poll were not available.
Super Bowl: 
Who hasn’t blacked 
out in New Orleans?
The cause behind the blackout during Sunday’s Super Bowl 
is still unknown. This is hilarious because it’s 2013, and we were under the impression that we could solve the mys-
teries behind basic power outages in the same night.
“We were asking everybody at every position what was hap-
pening, and the fact of the matter is we just didn’t know,” Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, told the Los Angeles Times, according to the New Yorker.
If you plugged something back in or tweaked a spark plug 
(how does electricity work?), then you probably understand what went wrong in the ﬁ  rst place. Instead, like Lake Malice’s comic this week, let’s speculate about all of the fun, possible true causes:
1. Beyoncé?
No, her awesome performance didn’t cause a complete inter-
nal collapse of a power infrastructure, but it might as well have.
Too much girl power on stage could totally cause a power out-age, right?
2. Gun control laws?Has Obama started to take away our guns AND our elec-
tricity?! Here we thought he’s been innocently trying to save as many lives in the future as he can by entirely restricting our rights and freedoms as Americans, obviously. Instead, he’s prob-
ably been planning other ways to ruin our mundane lives. That 
leaky bathroom faucet? OBAMA!
3. Cold weather?Listen, we’re all bitter about the weather turning against us. 
Sadly , that’s how winter works. As Floridians, we will defend our right to wear shorts at any time of year until we die (of frost-bite). Because the game was in good ol’ New Orleans, maybe the electricity system also rebelled against the cooler temperature. Who knows how a cold snap made a grid of wires feel? Probably 
like quitting for 34 minutes.
4. Chris Brown?
Odds are he could’ve had something to do with it.5. Elaborate Destiny’s Child revenge plot?Yeah, so what if Destiny’s Child sort of reunited and then 
performed together on the halftime stage? Maybe the other girls (or just Michelle Williams) are jealous of Beyoncé’s awesome life and took it out on her by shutting down the game for a few min-utes. We know it didn’t directly affect Beyoncé at all, but we like 
the idea because it sounds like a heist movie.
6. Apple Maps?
Remember how terribly inaccurate that app is — always 
showing people the wrong stuff? Well, if the spark grid (really, how does electricity work?) ran on similarly faulty Apple tech-nology , it was probably more likely to malfunction than if it was running on a few other operating systems.
7. Puppy Bowl jealousyFace it: The Puppy Bowl is the best part of any Super Bowl. 
Accept it. Because more people should know about it, perhaps 
the puppy players orchestrated an adorable scheme for more at-
tention.
Which option seems most likely to you? When supporters of LGBT equality denounced 
Chick-ﬁ  l-A for its president’s comments regard-ing gay marriage, conservatives rushed to support 
the fast-food chain and defended Dan Cathy’s freedom of speech.
However, people did not criticize Cathy for his words but 
for his actions. It’s been known that Chick-ﬁ  l-A donated mil-lions to anti-gay groups that support horrible laws here and abroad.
Despite claims of a violation of Cathy’s freedom of speech 
or religion, we should note that, ironically, the First Amend-ment also protects the criticism Cathy received. Furthermore, the First Amendment only protects attacks on speech from the government — not private individuals.
The First Amendment also protects freedom of associa-
tion. If I don’t like the practices of a particular business, I can choose whether I purchase their products or services.
Like you and I, Cathy and any other Chick-ﬁ  l-A execu-
tives have the right to associate with or donate money to whomever they want. But that doesn’t mean I have to agree with it.
Arranging boycotts against Chick-ﬁ  l-A or companies 
with policies we disagree with is what freedom is about. The 
beauty of a country based on individual liberty and private 
property is that we can patronize or not patronize and associ-ate or not associate with whomever we wish.
Companies that support terrible policies or engage in 
anti-gay activities have to suffer the consequences of their ac-tions. They might gain customers who agree with them now, but as the tide turns on the issue of gay marriage as younger generations replace older ones, they should realize their poli-cies won’t be sustainable in the long run.  
In his concurring opinion in Whitney v. California, Jus-
tice Louis Brandeis wrote “to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by process of educa-tion, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” 
The action (or inaction) of boycotting — choosing not to 
buy from a company that supports discriminatory groups or policies — represents this Brandeisian concept of coun-terspeech.
Conservatives who purported-
ly support the free market destroy the power of their argument when they condemn groups for peace-
fully boycotting. The free market 
relies on voluntary associations, which includes the freedom to not associate. Those who boycott com-panies for practices with which 
they disagree are simply engaging in a perfectly valid mar-ket activity.
In the past, the government passed laws banning discrim-
ination by governments and private businesses. Government 
discrimination, such as Jim Crow laws in the pre-civil rights 
era south, should certainly be prohibited to promote equality under the law.
However, laws that force racists, homophobes and anti-
Semitics who own private businesses to interact with groups they wouldn’t otherwise choose to be around hinders the power of the freedom to associate. These people are terrible for holding such hateful views and need to be shown the er-ror of their ways.
Yet, because anti-discrimination laws circumvent the 
power of social pressure and counterspeech to prevent dis-crimination, sentiments like racism and homophobia are gen-erally pushed underground and away from public scrutiny. This keeps racists and homophobes in business and makes it difﬁ  cult for those seeking to challenge such views to identify discriminatory companies and boycott them.
As John Stuart Mill contended in “On Liberty ,” “The 
whole strength and value, then, of human judgment, de-
pending on the one property , that it can be set right when it 
is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of setting it right are kept constantly at hand.” 
Open discrimination means we can ﬁ  ght racism and ho-
mophobia out in the open. Freedom means the freedom to discriminate and the freedom to boycott that discrimination.

Managing Time for 
Academic Success
Many college students have very busy schedules and the 
pressure of being academically successful can be great, so 
being able to manage your time is essential! In fact, accord-ing to a 2010 Healthy Gators survey, UF students reported that effectively managing their time was “very important” to 
their academic success. Indeed, learning how to manage 
your time helps increase productivity and reduces procras-tination, both of which can improve academic success. So how do you turn this knowledge into action?
1. Assess how you are currently using your time. 
For 2-3 days, keep a time log of what you do during the day 
and how long you spend doing it. Afterwards, look for trends. 
Identify which activities are important (see #2 ) and which are 
time wasters.
2. Know what’s important! Prioritize your daily and 
weekly tasks. Then, organize your time according to your pri-orities. Higher priority tasks should come ﬁ  rst.3. Make time to manage time. Set aside consistent 
time in your schedule to organize how you will use your time. 
This can be done on a daily, weekly, monthly, and even whole-
semester basis.  There are a wide variety of tools that can be used to help with this including planners, calendars, phone apps, and “to do” lists. Pick whatever works for you and your 
organization style.
4. Minimize distractions. Identify what your common 
distractors and time wasters are. Then, come up with a plan 
to minimize these where possible. This may mean studying in a different environment, turning off the TV and/or computer, putting your phone on silent, or even setting aside speciﬁ  c times of the day that you will not answer the phone or hang-
out with friends.
5. Learn to say NO! Sometimes it feels like you do 
not have enough time in the day to get everything done be-
cause… YOU DON’T. If 24 hours rarely seems like enough time, then you may be putting too much on your plate. Sound familiar? Identify current activities that are not priorities and decrease them or cut them out completely. In the future, be-fore you say yes to something new, ask yourself it if realis-
tically ﬁ  ts in with your priorities and time. If you do take on something new, think about cutting something else out of your 
schedule.
6. Make time for yourself! Living a balanced life is 
important to your overall wellbeing. Schedule time to take care of yourself and manage your stress. Take breaks while studying, relax at the end of a long day, or schedule in activi-ties that you enjoy doing such as volunteering, hiking, danc-ing, going to sporting events, or spending time with friends.

how to schedule an appointment with a wellness coach to work on time management, visit GatorWell’s web site at ga-
torwell.ufsa.uﬂ  .edu.
Recently at GatorWell we asked Univer-
sity of Florida students to provide us feed-
back about what speciﬁ  c questions they 
had about health.
The following are two of your alcohol 
questions that we thought were especially 
great and our answers: 
Q1. What should I do when everyone 
around me is drinking and I don’t wish to drink?
First of all, if you choose not to drink, 
you are not alone. At UF, over 17,000 stu-dents choose not to drink alcohol. 
The decision of when, where, and why 
you drink is yours. It should not be de-
pendent on the drinking habits of those 
around you. 
Remember that it is always okay to say 
no to a drink. Be polite but ﬁ  rm in your re-fusal. You can also carry around a non-alcoholic drink such as juice, soda, tea, and water. Keep busy-make conversation, enjoy the meal or appetizers, take pho-
tos with other guests, or dance with your 
friends. Offer to be the sober designated driver. 
Explain your reasons for not drinking or 
make an excuse such as you’re allergic to alcohol, you have a test or project the next day, you have to get up early the next morning, you don’t want to spend the mon-ey, you’ve been sick and taking antibiotics, 
or it is contrary to your religious beliefs. 
Regardless of what you say, the deci-
sion to not drink is your own and it should 
be respected by your friends.
Q2. Is there any way to know if drugs 
have been slipped into your drink at your party?
It is important to remember that alco-hol itself is the cheapest type of drug. It is also quite accessible and readily available. It is easy to lose track of how many drinks 
you have consumed and quickly raise your 
Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) to over the legal limit of .08. 
Further, if an individual has passed out 
from drinking too much, legally they can-not give their consent for sexual activity. 
There is really no way to detect if an 
additional drug has been slipped into your drink. Most drugs are odorless, colorless, 
and tasteless.
If a drug such as Rohypnol, Ketamine, 
or GHB has been slipped into your drink, 
you will being to experience the effects 
almost immediately including a sleepy, 
relaxed, and drunk feeling that lasts any-where between 2 to 8 hours. 
These types of drugs combined with al-
cohol can also result in amnesia, respira-
tory depression, and death. 
Ways to decrease your risk include the 
following: Get a fresh drink if you have left 
your drink unattended.
 Never accept drinks from some-
one you don’t know, even if
 it is an acquaintance
 Watch the bartender or server 
make your drink
 Use the “buddy system” 
to watch out for friends
 Never leave a party or club 
with someone you do not 
know well and trust
 Be alert to any unusual 
behavior around you
  If you suspect your drink has 
been drugged, seek medical help 
as soon as possible

Exercise journaling: 
A way to get up and go
You may have made a New Year’s resolution to 
work out more, but by the end of February most of 
those resolutions have begun to fade away like the winter weather in Florida. A great way to get back on that horse is to start an exercise journal, which 
enables you to easily track your progress and see 
just how much you’ve improved over time.
Following are five tips on starting your own exer -
cise journal:
1. Decide how you want to journal. You can buy 
a traditional paper journal or use an online journal or app for your smartphone. Try www.onlinefitness-log.com or check out the “Body Fitness” app for iPhone—both are free!
2. Set aside time to journal. Find the time of day 
and environment that works best so you’ll stick to it.
3. Consider making short-term goals, such as 
exercising three times in one week.
4. Track your weekly activities. Give yourself 
credit for being active throughout the week, and re-member that things like walking the dog and clean-ing the house count, too!
Specific items to track regarding your exercise: 
1) How am I feeling? (energy level, muscle/joint pain and mood); 2) What did I do? (time, distance and/or reps); and 3) How have I progressed? (faster, further and/or other successes).5. Allow yourself to just write! Write about your 
feelings and thoughts however they come out.
Be patient with yourself. It may take time to get 
comfortable with the idea of journaling if you’ve nev-er done it before, so don’t worry if you miss a day or two. Just pick up your pen and start writing again when you can.
Reread your entries every month or so. Be objec-
tive and take the opportunity to see what areas you can improve, but also look back and celebrate the progress you have made! For more information about exercise, visit the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition web site at www.fitness.gov.
You meet him or her at a club. You decide to hang out afterward and 
have a little fun—“nothing serious”—but if your after-hours play includes 
unprotected oral sex, you could easily bring home a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Oral sex puts you in contact with skin and body fluids, any of which can 
contain disease-causing viruses or bacteria. STIs can be passed through oral sex, and spitting out semen will not protect you against them, as some of the virus or bacteria stays behind.
The most common STIs seen at the University of Florida Student Health 
Care Center (SHCC) are human papillomavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonor -
rhea and genital herpes. Fortunately, the SHCC is available to help stu-dents with confidential testing, counseling and treatment.
Protection used with every sexual act, including oral sex, will reduce 
the risk of acquiring an STI; however, remember that skin not covered is 
not protected.
Following are four ways to protect yourself from contracting an STI:
1. Use protection. Use regular or flavored condoms, or oral dams.
2. Do not shave on or very close to the genitals. Shaving can leave 
cuts in the skin, which increase the likelihood of infection.
3. Know your partner. If you see something suspicious on or near a 
potential sexual partner’s genitals, you may want to think twice!
4. Know yourself. Check your body regularly and see your health 
care provider with concerns.
If you have any questions or concerns, make an appointment with your SHCC primary 
care provider. For more information about sexual health and STIs, visit the American Social 
Health Association’s web site at www.ashastd.org.Be careful what you put 
in your mouth

Incorporating physical activi-
ty into your day can be a healthy 
habit that benefits every aspect of your life including stress lev-els, mood, energy, weight man-agement, and sleep. 
According of a 2010 Univer -
sity of Florida Healthy Gators survey students ranked “ex-ercise/fitness” as their fourth 
greatest health concern. Sound 
relatable?
 
The US Department of 
Health and Human Services recommends “Adults should do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes each week of aerobic physical 
activity at a moderate level.” 
Examples of moderate physical activities include walking briskly to class, dancing, biking, and swimming. 
A good rule of thumb to know 
if you are working at a moder -
ate level is that you should be able to talk while participating in 
these activities, but not sing. 
Here are some tips to help 
you get started or increase 
your current level of physical activity:
1. You don’t have to 
leave your house. 
 Sit on an exercise ball 
while you read or write a paper.  
 Get up during commer -
cials and study breaks and do some jumping-jacks, sit-ups, or 
push-ups. 
 Use technology. Try Wii 
fitness, Kinect, YouTube fitness videos, or fitness DVDs like P90X.
 
2. Change your daily 
routines. 
 Park at the end of the 
parking lot and use that oppor -
tunity to add physical activity to your errands. Chores count too- vacuum, dust, mop, scrub, they 
all get you moving.
 Bike to campus.
 Walk to that next class 
rather than taking the bus.
 Use a pedometer to track 
your daily steps- everything 
counts!
3.Get Social! 
 Get an exercise buddy 
that will keep you motivated. 
 Grab a couple friends and 
take a trip out to Lake Wauberg. 
 Join an intramural team, 
club team, or student organiza-tion. From sailing to table ten-nis, quidditch to dance, there are lots of activities to try out on 
campus.
 
4.Try New Things.
 The Gainesville Rock Gym 
offers a fun rock climbing expe-
rience.   UF Rec Sports, community 
gyms and centers, and even the Alachua County Public Library offer unique group classes such as Bosu, Country Line 
Dance, Dance Fusion, Yoga 
and Zumba.
 
 If you’re up for a little 
adventure, The Lake Alice walking/biking path, Paynes Prairie State Preserve, Morn-ingside Trails, and/or San 
Felasco Hammock Preserve 
are fun options to experience nature while getting in some physical activity. 
5.Other Tips.
 Gradually build new ac-
tivities or longer time spent exercising into your routine.
 
 Feel proud of your ac-
complishments and celebrate your successes! Use an app to keep track.
 Keep at it! Try new 
things until you find an activ-ity that is both challenging and fun. The more you incor -
porate physical activity into 
your daily routine, the more 
you will start to feel the ben-efits of it.
 
Get a friend, set up a 
couple times you’re available during the week, and get moving UF!
 Always be prepared
Accidents can happen: Condoms can break because they are past the expira-
tion date, stored improperly, or used incorrectly, especially in the heat of the mo-
ment. If you’re worried that a condom may break, you may want to keep the follow-ing points in mind. 
Condoms should never be stored in a wallet, car, or direct sunlight because 
heat, even body heat, weakens the condom over time. Oil-based lubricants also cause condoms to break. Instead choose a water or silicone-based lube (Astro-glide, Wet, etc) which is safe for use with condoms and can help prevent break-age by reducing friction. Never use two condoms at once because the friction can cause both condoms to break. 
When putting the condom on, first check the expiration date and squeeze the 
condom package to ensure it still has an air bubble (if it does not, the package and condom may be punctured). Open the package carefully (no teeth, nails, or scis-sors). Pinch the tip of the condom to leave space for ejaculation and unroll the con-
dom all the way down. After sex, hold the base of the condom before withdrawing. 
If you or your partner ever find yourself in a situation where the condom does 
break there are a few things to consider. If pregnancy prevention is a concern, con-
sider following your condom breaking incident with Plan B. Also known as emer -
gency contraception, or EC, the high-dose birth control pill is available over-the-counter and can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours. Plan B is most effective when within 24 hours. Women and men over 17 years of age can call a doctor, a health clinic, a pharmacy, or place an overnight order from Drugstore.com without a prescription.
If sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention is a concern, there are some 
things to consider. There are different window periods, or time it takes for the STI to be detected in a persons’ system, so the timing of testing is important. 
When it does come time to test, there are some reasonably priced or even free 
options to consider on campus or in the Gainesville community. 
Free confidential HIV testing for UF students is available on campus at the Ga-
torWell main office (352-273-4450) by appointment only. HIV testing, as well as oth-er STI testing (including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis), is also available at the Student Health Care Center (392-1161), 
Planned Parenthood of North Florida (352-377-0881) and 
at the Alachua County Health Department (352-334-7960). 
Depending on the site, pricing ranges from free to 
fees determined by a sliding scale fee or based on your insurance.

Why should I be concerned about 
skin cancer?
Skin cancer is the most common type of 
cancer in the United States, and can affect 
anyone regardless of skin color; approxi-
mately 1 million Americans are diagnosed with it each year. 
Considering that you live in sunny Flor -
ida, always remember to use sunscreen, 
which is readily available from any Gator -
Well location. Additionally, the UF Student Health Care Center offers dermatology clinic services every Friday and once-a-semester mole screenings to address indi-vidual concerns, as well as teach students how to do self-examinations for skin can-
cer warning signs. Contact your primary 
care provider for more information.
What’s the difference between sun-
block and sunscreen?
Sunblock is a lotion that blocks the sun’s harmful rays from your skin, while sunscreen only blocks the redness-pro-
ducing rays from the sun. 
Sunblock will give you more protection 
from the sun as opposed to sunscreen. 
Keep in mind that people of all skin 
types should use sunscreen.

10, FUN AND FITNESS, ALLIGATOR ¡ WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2013
The Transcendental Meditation 
(TM) technique is a simple, natural, 
effortless procedure practiced 20 minutes twice each day while sitting comfortably with the eyes closed. The most widely practiced and most researched method of self-develop-ment, TM has proven effective in over 600 research studies conduct-
ed at more than 200 universities and 
research centers—including Har-vard, UCLA, and Stanford.
Reduction of anxiety and de-
pression are among the chief health beneﬁ  ts of the TM technique. A study published in the Journal of Counseling and Development found that patients suffering from 
post-traumatic stress problems who 
learned the TM technique showed signiﬁ  cant reduction in depression after four months, in contrast to oth-ers who were randomly assigned to receive psychotherapy.
“The Transcendental Meditation 
technique tends to produce what is most needed in our lives—balance,” 
says James Krag, M.D., president of 
the Psychiatric Society of Virginia. 
Researchers say that the unique 
state of restful alertness gained during the TM technique promotes health by reducing activation of the sympathetic nervous system—which, in turn, dilates the blood ves-sels and reduces stress hormones, 
such as adrenaline, noradrenaline, 
and cortisol. “Research has shown that the 
practice of the TM technique is, on average, twice as effective [as other types of meditation] in reducing anxiety and changing and reducing physiological correlates of stress, which are the basis of the body’s healing responses, at the basis of prevention of disease and promotion 
of health,” said Robert Schneider, 
M.D., who has been awarded more than $20 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for his pioneering research on natural approaches to heart disease. 
More than ﬁ  ve million people 
worldwide practice this simple tech-nique—people of all ages, cultures, and religions. Celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld, Clint Eastwood, and Ellen DeGeneres are regular prac-titioners, and last summer, Ameri-
can icon Oprah Winfrey learned the 
technique and introduced it to her staff in Chicago, LA, and New York. Business owners throughout the country are seeing similar results.Transcendental MeditationWhen you think of college students’ eating patterns, 
do you picture nutritious, balanced meals? Or is the image ﬁ  lled with fast food, pizza, and eating ramen until you can’t stand to look at it ever again? For many students the reality is somewhere in between and for 
good reasons. 
Dr. Brian Wansink at Cornell University found that 
the average person makes more than 250 food-related 
decisions a day. While studying why people choose the foods they do, Dr. Karen Glanz found that taste, cost and often convenience outweigh nutrition. When you are making many daily food decisions in the context of an irregular, packed schedule and a tight college budget, it is easy to see why cost and convenience 
can trump nutrition. What can you do if you want tasty, 
healthy food when time and money are in short supply? The trick is making nutritious choices both convenient and attractive so that the decision is an easy one.
Pack a Snack:
 Snacking is often a key source of fuel for busy days 
and late night study sessions, but the cost can add up quickly if you have to buy snacks when hunger strikes. Have a stock of go-to snacks on hand: 
• Pack a banana, apple, carrot sticks or grapes – a 
great and inexpensive way to get some extra fruit and vegetable servings in. 
• Make your own trail mix at home with nuts, dried 
fruit, cereal and chocolate chips for a satisfying snack that is easy to pack. You can change it up each week to ﬁ  t your tastes and ingredients that are on sale. 
• Bring a peanut butter sandwich for a low cost 
snack that can keep you going until your next meal.
Eating on Campus:  
One of the keys to eating well on campus is know-ing your options. Take a look around the dining loca-
tions that are most convenient for your schedule or 
check out Gator Dining’s web site for a guide to smart food choices at locations across campus.
• At the dining halls, stop by the salad bar to round 
out your meal with a few favorite veggies. 
• At eateries like Subway and Moe’s Southwest Grill 
take advantage of the option to add extra veggies to your sandwich or entree for free.
• Look for substitutions like brown rice, whole grain 
bread or vegetable side dishes to easily pack in some extra nutrients.
At the Grocery Store :
Sticking to a grocery list and buying only what you 
know you will use can reduce unpleasant surprises at the register.
• Opt for items that you can enjoy for multiple meals. 
Canned black beans, chicken breast, cheese, salsa, tortillas, and lettuce are loaded with vitamins, minerals, ﬁ  ber, and protein. Turn them into burritos, quesadillas, and a taco salad.
• Weigh cost versus convenience. Throwing out a 
ton of produce that you bought with the best of in-tentions can leave you rethinking future purchases. If you are more likely to use the pre-cut fruit or bagged salad, the extra expense may be worth it in the long 
run.
• Consider trying a new recipe with friends and 
roommates. Splitting up the ingredient costs and prep 
time can make it more manageable and you can all enjoy the leftovers.
With these strategies, you can help make your 250+ 
food decisions a little easier. Visit gatorwell.ufsa.uﬂ  .edu for more healthy eating tips.

I got the ﬂ  u shot. Can I still catch the ﬂ  u?
The ﬂ  u shot cannot give you the ﬂ  u. And while it dramatically lessens your chance of catching true inﬂ  u-
enza, there is still a slim possibility you may come down with inﬂ  uenza after getting vaccinated. (Luckily, this is very rare!) Other ways to reduce your chances of getting sick are to wash your hands regularly, cover your cough and avoid close contact with others who may be sick. Remember to get vaccinated against inﬂ  uenza 
every year, or talk to your health care provider if you have a special condition or allergies that prevent regular 
vaccination. Visit www.ﬂ  u.gov for more information.
How do I know the difference between a cold and the ﬂ  u?It can be hard to tell the difference between a cold and the ﬂ  u since both have similar symptoms, but ﬂ  u 
symptoms are typically worse than cold symptoms. You usually have higher fevers with ﬂ  u that can last three to four days, and the ﬂ  u virus affects your whole body. You may also have extreme fatigue, achy muscles, dry cough and sore throat.
I seem to get sick often. Can I improve my resistance to colds?There are various ways to boost your immune system. Believe it or not, getting a full night’s rest can help 
your immunity. In addition, maintain healthy habits such as staying hydrated, managing stress, engaging in regular physical activity and eating a variety of nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables.Cold & Flu Prevention

�   ARKANSAS WON 80-69.
LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
  Florida has dominated South-
eastern Conference opponents this 
season, but it ﬁ  nally experienced the other end of the beating against Arkansas.  
  The Razorbacks used hot outside 
shooting to stun the No. 2 Gators (18-3, 8-1 SEC) 80-69 on Tuesday night in Bud Walton Arena in Fay-etteville, Ark., snapping UF’s 10-game winning streak. 
  Arkansas’ 80 points are the most 
Florida has allowed this season.
Before Tuesday’s contest, UF 
defeated SEC opponents by an average margin of 26.5 points per game. 
  “Winning, success, it’s really 
hard to handle,” coach Billy Dono-van said.
“A lot of people have a hard 
time handling success. I thought we came out and did not play like 
we have played. That was the dis-
appointing part.”
  The Razorbacks (14-8, 5-4 SEC) 
shot 49.1 percent from the ﬁ  eld and 44.4 percent from beyond the arc. Arkansas, the No. 12 three-point shooting team in the SEC at 29.8 percent before Tuesday, scored 7 of its 8 threes in the ﬁ  rst 10:16. 
  “I put it on the board to our 
guys. We can’t disrespect the three-point line,” Donovan said.
“There were so many times our 
guys were standing there with their feet below the line in great defen-sive position but not even putting a hand up to alter it, to change it, to make them think twice about shooting.”
  Donovan chose not to send a 
full-court press at Arkansas early in the game, and the Razorbacks ex-celled offensively in the half court 
and in transition.
Arkansas made 3 of its ﬁ  rst 4 three-pointers and jumped out to a 
9-2 lead. 
  Razorbacks forward Marshawn 
Powell scored nine of Arkansas’ ﬁ  rst 21 points on 4-of-4 shooting. 
  For a 6-minute stretch until 9:12 
remained in the ﬁ  rst half, the Ra-zorbacks outscored the Gators 22-5,  taking a 36-13 lead. Arkansas start-ed the game shooting 15 of 20. 
  The Razorbacks, who took a 43-
26 lead into halftime, opened the 
second half on a 6-0 run. Arkansas 
led by as many as 27 points in the second half, but Florida cut the def-icit to 13 with 3:52 remaining after an 11-2 run.
UF’s rally fell short. The Gators 
couldn’t hit enough shots to cut the deﬁ  cit to single digits. 
  Florida shot 41.1 percent, in-
cluding a 29.2 percent clip in the ﬁ  rst half. Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario recorded a team-best 15 points, while junior point guard Scottie Wilbekin scored 14 points on 5-of-15 shooting. 
  Senior forward Erik Murphy, the 
Gators’ leading scorer in SEC play before Tuesday with 14 points per 
game, scored nine points on 2-of-7 
shooting and tallied a team-high four turnovers. Murphy drilled his only three-pointer with 8:11 re-maining in the contest.
  Will Yeguete left with 15:52 re-
maining in the ﬁ  rst half because of discomfort caused by tendinitis in his right knee. He played 1 minute. 
  Junior center Patric Young tal-
lied nine points and four rebounds but fouled out with 3:41 remaining. 
  With Yeguete out and Young 
playing only 11 minutes in the ﬁ  rst half due to foul trouble, the Razor-backs outrebounded the Gators

 One year ago, Jonathon Crawford 
didn’t know where he stood.
  After logging just 3.2 innings as a 
freshman, he began 2012 alternating be-
tween spot starter and reliever.  But as 
starters ahead of him battled injuries last 
season, Crawford eventually earned a spot in the weekend rotation.
  Now, he is the Gators’ Friday starter.  “Anytime you have a guy like him 
at the front of your rotation, you have to feel good about it,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
  Crawford solidiﬁ  ed his status as a 
dominant starter when he threw a no-hitter in the opening game of the NCAA Gainesville Regional against Bethune-Cookman on June 1. Crawford’s gem was the ﬁ  rst complete game no-hitter by a Florida pitcher since 1991. 
  He ﬁ  nished his sophomore season with a 3.13 ERA and 73 strikeouts in 77.2 innings. 
  Crawford credited since-departed 
starter Hudson Randall for helping him with his demeanor and ability to keep an even keel during his breakout season.
  “He had ice running through his 
veins,” Crawford said of Hudson. “He 
showed no emotion.”
  After dominating at the end of last 
season, Crawford reﬁ  ned his changeup 
while pitching for the USA Collegiate National Team during the offseason. Crawford, who relies mostly on his fast-ball and his slider, plans to use the chan-geup more often this season.
  “I didn’t even think about throwing 
it,” Crawford said. “It just never came in my head that ‘I want to throw this in this situation.’ Whereas this year, when I get behind in the count, I can use it to get a ground ball.”
  Crawford said that improving his  Gators name No. 1 starterFIRE JOE MORGAN
  In an effort to jettison the mediocrity fans have endured since the Jacksonville Jag-uars last made the playoffs in 2007, owner 
Shahid Khan is changing everything.
  Khan is making revolutionary moves in 
Jacksonville, and I like it.
Scratch that. I love it.  Gone is former general manager Gene 
Smith, whose propensity to take chances on small-school project players in the NFL draft each year was half-hipster, half-freakish.
  Also shown the door was former coach 
Mike Mularkey, a sacriﬁ  cial lamb tasked with leading an overmatched, undermanned group 
of players against far superior competition 
during a trying and tumultuous season.
  In a ﬂ  urry of changes since Jacksonville end-
ed its worst season in franchise history, Khan replaced Smith with former Atlanta Falcons Director of Player Personnel David Caldwell, who promptly ﬁ  red Mularkey and tabbed for-mer Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Gus Bradley as the new guy in charge.
  After last season’s 2-14 debacle, Khan is 
bringing the Jaguars back from the dead.
  The changes bring hope to the fan base of a franchise with only two postseason ap-pearances since losing the AFC Champion-ship Game to the Ten-
nessee Titans follow-
ing the 1999 season.
  As a Jaguars fan, I 
am smitten with the 
recent moves. For the ﬁ  rst time in I don’t know how long, I have conﬁ  dence in the people run-ning the Jaguars.
  However, Khan is doing more than simply 
making personnel changes. Every NFL team 
makes some kind of coaching or front ofﬁ  ce 
hire every year.
  In fact, Jacksonville is one of four teams 
that ﬁ  red both its coach and general manager following the 2012 season.
  Khan is enacting wholesale changes, com-
pletely gutting the Jaguars and starting over.
  He spent millions to implement state-of-
the-art renovations at Jacksonville’s facilities. 
He scheduled one game in London for each of

“Sometimes getting humbled is a 
good thing to get us back to, ‘Who are we?’” Donovan said.
“We could have played a very good 
game and lost, but for our basketball team to be down to anybody by 25, 26, 28 points, that’s more of a reflection of us and not Arkansas. They played well — don’t get me wrong — but 
they’re not 28 points or 26 points bet-
ter than us. They are when we show up like we did today.”

He added that developing 
the pitch didn’t necessarily en-tail taking advice from anyone. Crawford simply had to prac-tice throwing it.
In UF’s last scrimmage, 
O’Sullivan said Crawford threw his changeup for strikes about 85 percent of the time.
“Obviously , he’s always had 
the great fastball and the break-ing ball,” O’Sullivan said. “But I think the changeup, the way that’s evolved, will take him to another level.”
The expectations are higher 
than ever for Crawford with another year of experience and an improved arsenal.
Despite the hype, O’Sullivan expects his No. 1 starter to stay grounded.
“I really think he’s a team 
guy ,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s very much concerned about how the team is doing and how they’re progressing. He’s done a great job with the younger players. I think he’s really con-sumed about the team’s suc-cess.”

Some say playing in Europe is not 
worth the trouble, but for a team looking 
to rebrand itself, just about any exposure is good exposure.
He even ditched the Jaguars’ signature 
home teal jerseys, making black the team’s new primary color. 
On Tuesday, Khan continued his de-
molition project by unveiling a new logo, the first change since Jacksonville officially joined the league in 1995. The franchise is expected to introduce new uniforms in April.
I’m not sure how to describe the new 
logo without sounding stupid, but here goes nothing. The jaguar looks more fear -
some. The cat is aggressive and opportu-nistic, much like Mr. Khan. Frankly, I think the new logo is kind of badass. Teal nose and all.
With an owner as business-savvy and forward thinking as Khan, I won’t be sur -
prised to learn of more changes down the road. The ‘stache will not stand pat.
Khan has made something out of noth-
ing before.
He came to the United States from Paki-
stan at age 16 with only $500 in his pock-et. His first job was washing dishes at an hourly rate of $1.20.
Now, Khan owns auto parts manufac-
turer Flex-N-Gate and the NFL’s Jaguars and is worth more than $2.5 billion.
Khan is an innovator who will stop 
at nothing to achieve what he wants. He seized an opportunity in Jacksonville and is methodically bringing his vision for the Jaguars to life.
Khan is a man that strives to be ahead 
of the curve, and as he continually be-
comes more accustomed to the NFL, Jack-
sonville’s prospects will only improve.
He is bold, he is a risk-taker and he is 
the only guy I want running the Jaguars.

Hannah Rogers’ ERA in 2012 would 
make AL Cy Young Award winner David 
Price’s jaw drop. But for the Gators’ junior 
righty, there’s always room for improve-
ment.
Rogers has been working on changing 
her pitch repertoire and improving her lo-
cation.
“I am trying to work on hitting new 
spots with my pitches instead of just con-
stantly hitting the 
same spots,” Rogers 
said.  
Despite improv-
ing her ERA from 1.92 
in 2011 to 1.23 in 2012, Rogers’ accuracy didn’t show the same jump.
As a freshman, Rogers struck out 221 
batters and walked 70 in 265.2 innings — a 
strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.15. 
During her sophomore campaign, she 
pitched fewer innings because of fatigue. In 228.1 innings, she tallied 202 punch outs and walked 65, dropping the ratio to 3.11. 
But this year, Rogers is healthy and 
ready to go.Rogers comes into 2013 as the Gators’ 
ace and will likely throw the first pitch in 
Friday’s season opener against Creighton in the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz.
“This is probably the best offseason I 
feel like I’ve had,” she said. “I feel fresh from my legs to my arms.”
Coach Tim Walton said the junior has 
focused on getting back into top shape 
during the offseason.
“She doesn’t say a lot,” Walton said of 
Rogers. “Last week, I don’t think she said 
anything to anybody. She just kept mow-
ing batters down left and right and went about her business.”
Walton said Rogers will be more dy-
namic when she takes the field for Florida 
this year, and Rogers’ teammates agree.
Sophomore pitcher and first baseman 
Lauren Haeger has seen Rogers’ new 
pitches in the bullpen and from the bat-
ter’s box.
“[Rogers] has an amazing dropball that 
none of us can hit, no matter how many 
times we try,” Haeger said. “And she has a lot of off-speed (pitches), so it really mess-
es with your timing.”
Freshman catcher Aubree Munro has 
caught Rogers in scrimmages and said the 
junior is one of the best pitchers she’s ever 
caught.
“[Rogers is] an awesome pitcher for me, 
as a catcher, to work with,” Munro said. 
“It makes my job pretty easy back there.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 2013

Freshman Luke Johnson struggled during his first se-
mester playing college tennis.
After going 2-6 in singles and 1-3 in doubles, the Eng-
land product has bounced back during the dual meet sea-
son.
Johnson has become a reliable starter for the Gators, 
showing that he can earn victories for an inexperienced team.
With his  victory against Furman’s Richard Casagrande 
on Sunday, Johnson improved his  singles record to 3-1.
He is 2-0 in doubles.“I’m glad to see [Johnson] rebound and play disci-plined, solid tennis and working his way to the net to finish off opponents,” coach Bryan Shelton said.
Johnson’s improved play at the net is 
paying dividends in doubles.
Because Johnson plays in the advan-
tage court, he does not serve and is at net 
the net during most points.
Johnson has played with four dif-
ferent partners — Mike Alford, Florent 
Diep, Billy Federhofer and Stephane Piro — in four dou-bles matches this season.
Playing with Alford for the first time against the Pala-
dins, Johnson helped win the doubles point for the Gators with an 8-4 victory against Furman’s Jacob Behal and Casagrande.
“It was great to clinch the point,” Johnson said. “It was 
great momentum for us heading into singles play.”
Johnson played Sunday’s only closely contested match. 
Facing Casagrande, Johnson breezed by him in the first set, winning 6-1.
However, Casagrande battled back, winning the sec-
ond set by clinching the tiebreaker for a 7-6 (5) win.
But Johnson regained momentum, taking the deciding 
10-point tiebreaker (10-5) and securing the Gators’ third sweep of the season.
“He lost a little bit of focus in the second set,” Shelton 
said.
“You can see how quickly a match can turn, but Luke 
regained his confidence to rebound in the tiebreak.”Freshman rebounding after struggling during fall season
