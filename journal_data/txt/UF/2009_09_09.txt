LOCALLane closures to
congest Main St.
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Writer
Don't expect to get somewhere
quickly on Main Street -at least
not for another two years.
According to the Florida De-
partment of Transportation,
the road construction on Main
Street that began Tuesday won't
be completed until the spring of
2011, and drivers can expect lane
closures and detours as the con-
struction is completed.
The $6 million project will con-
vert the current four-lane road to
a two-lane section with 11-foot
travel lanes, a 12-foot center turn
lane, 5-foot bicycle lanes and on-
street parking, according to an
FDOT release.The roadwork will also re-
place broken sidewalks, upgrade
wheelchair accessible crosswalks,
add a bus bay in each direction
and improve pedestrian crossing
and walk signals.
The revamped section of the
road will stretch between Eighth
and Depot avenues.
Message boards announcing
lane closures were put up on
Sept. 2, and the lane closures will
begin Friday, said Laurie Wind-
ham, the project spokeswoman
for the planning firm PBS & J,
which is working with the FDOT
on the project.
Beginning Friday, one lane in
each direction will be closed be-
tween First and Eighth avenues.

As the Inter-Residence Hall Association
found out this summer, Facebook pictures of
an on-campus party with underage drinking
can get you in trouble with UF.
After pictures from a party in April got the
attention of housing officials, IRHA found it-
self before the Student Conduct Committee,
which concluded the organization was re-
sponsible for violating the Student Conduct
Code and sanctioned it for the first time in its
history.
The committee, composed of students and
faculty, determined IRHA was guilty of un-
derage possession or consumption of alcohol,
distribution or sale of alcohol to underage
people and violation of university policy.
As a result, the organization received a
written reprimand -which goes in its file -
and executive board members are required
to attend an ethical decision-making seminar
and then conduct a presentation on ethics to
all the voting members of IRHA. The sanc-
* UF showcased
only a little bit of its
new no-huddle sets
during Saturday's
win over Charles-
ton Southern. The
Gators like the
ability to keep
opposing defenses
offguard.
See Story, Page 14.tions became official in July.
Individual members of the organization
were also sanctioned, said Chris Loschiavo,
director of UF's Student Conduct and Con-
flict Resolution, but he said the records are
confidential.
The party, which occurred on April 24 in a
Beaty Towers dorm, was attended by 17 peo-
ple, 10 of whom were members
On of IRHA. Three of the partygo-
CampUS ers were executive officers.
Beer pong was also played -
which is a violation of the conduct code when
it happens on campus -but IRHA wasn't
sanctioned for it.
Though members of the organization pro-
tested that the party was not sponsored by
IRHA, the committee found otherwise.
Loschiavo said one of the main reasons
the committee decided it was an IRHA event
was that many of the organization's leaders
knew about or attended the event.
The Facebook photo album with party
pictures was also titled "IRHA Bash," he said,

* OFFICIALS: HE WAS DRIVING

A St. Petersburg man was trans-
ported to Shands at UF after allegedly
stealing a Department of Transporta-
tion pickup truck and crashing into
seven vehicles on University Avenue
Tuesday.
Perry Swinton, 18, allegedly stole
the truck at 1500 E University Ave.
and headed west before hitting a car
at the intersection of Waldo Road
and East University Avenue, accord-
ing to Gainesville Police Department
spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg.
He hit another car at 300 E Univer-
sity Ave. before colliding with five
more cars at 100 W University Ave.,
Kameg said.
The accident, which occurred at
3:15 p.m., sent two to Shands, includ-ing Swinton, who "had to be cut out
of the vehicle, but is expected to live,"
Kameg said, adding that the vehicle
was traveling at speeds "in excess of
100 mph."
According to witness Jay Deren-
thal, Swinton was conscious but ap-
peared to be "in shock and nodding
out" just seconds af-
ter the last collision
occurred.
Derenthal got
a fire extinguisher
after noticing gas
leaking from the
truck, where Swin-
Kameg ton lay pinned by
wreckage.
He waited, warning those around
the scene not to smoke, for about
seven minutes until rescue vehicles
arrived at the scene.
Kameg said charges have not yet
been filed, but Swinton will face
stolen vehicle charges "at the mini-
mum."

Senators pass $14.4
They debated for 4 hours
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
ctillo@alligator org
Student Senate heated up
Tuesday night as senators passed
a $14.4 million budget, which is
made up of Student Activity and
Service fees.
However, it was not without
opposition and four hours of de-
bate.
Orange and Blue Sen. Jon Os-
sip proposed an amendment,
which would eliminate $39,915 in
what he called "perks and waste-
ful spending."
He said the amendment would
cut money that serves as allow-
ances for SG officials' cell phone
bills and money for SG lobbying
trips.
The amendment initially pro-
posed adding $40,000 to the
campus readership program so
the Wall Street Journal could beavailable on campus.
However, the amount was re-
duced to $35,000.
"I think this is really about
what example we set and wheth-
er we want to
spend Student
Body money
on something
that benefits all
students or just
people at the
top," said Or-
ange and Blue
Sen. Ben Cava-
taro, after he gave a presentation
detailing the benefits.
Unite Party Sen. Ben Meyers
said the word "perks" implies SG
officials do not deserve the ben-
efits.
"This isn't corruption," Mey-
ers said. "It's necessary, it's fair-
ness."
After about two hours of de-
bate and four modifications theM budget
amendment failed 45-18.
Senators also debated a second
amendment, which would cut
travel costs from Accent, SG Pro-
ductions and Computer Network
Support while increasing funds
given to student organizations.
The amendment failed 50-15.
After finalizing the budget
debate, Ossip presented a bill
that would limit the amount of
allowances alloted toward SG
cell phone bills and decrease the
number of SG officials who re-
ceive them from eight to three.
Ossip's bill failed with a vote
of 38-21.
Ossip expanded upon Student
Body President Jordan Johnson's
recent FERPA waiver intitiative
with a bill that further promotes
transparency.
This bill would also allow ac-
cess to senators' e-mails related
to SG.
However, the outcome of the
transparency bill vote was not
available by press time.

Law school ranks
8th for Hispanics
Felicidades!, Levin College of Law.
For the seventh time in nine years, UF's law college has been
named as one of the top 10 law schools for Hispanic students
by Hispanic Business Magazine.
The college ranked fifth among U.S. public schools and
eighth among private and public schools for its recruitment, re-
tention and education of Hispanic students,
U F according to the magazine's Web site.
Academics "There are a series of factors that stu-
dents care about when they choose a school:
ranking, cost, reputation, success rates, employment rates,"
said Berta Esperanza Hernandez-Truyol, a professor in the col-
lege. "But, all things equal, Latina and Latino students probably
gravitate to a place that offers them all kinds of role models."
According to the Office of Admissions, Hispanic enrollment
at the college reached 9 percent in 2009.
When the results of next year's ranking are released, the fac-
ulty at UF Law believes the school will once again appear on
Hispanic Business Magazine's list.
"I think the real kick came the first time we received a top 10
ranking," Hernandez-Truyol said. "In the years after that, it has
become a wonderful affirmation."

Pastor passes on invocation
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
cpruner@a Iligator org
Monday morning's meeting agenda was
a monstrous, 55-topic affair that was to con-
dense budget, ordinance and other matters
into three hours.
What everyone wanted to talk about, how-
ever, was the first three minutes.
Terry Jones, the head pastor of the Dove
World Outreach Center who has received
recent attention for his anti-Islam campaign,
was supposed to give an introduction prayer,
or invocation, prior to the meeting's start.
As the hands on the clock crept closer to
9 a.m., about 40 pairs of eyes in the Alachua
County Commission meeting lunged for the
door with every creak.
Jones never came.
Instead, Wayne Sapp, a pastor who acts
as second-in-command at the church, gave a
brief, 53-word statement on behalf of Jones,
who, according to Sapp, was away on a busi-
ness trip in South Florida. Jones was rotated
into the invocation spot by the county from a
list of religious leaders.
The invocation, whichSapp said the church
knew about since late July, addressed the sub-ject of Islam only once, calling for "Muslims
to speak out against oppression and violent
behavior." The comments barely sparked any
flickers of emotion from the deflated crowd.
"Well, that was anticlimactic," said Sam
Bass, a deputy with the Alachua County's
Sheriff's Office who expected to be "in the
line of fire."
Sapp, who paid for the now-famous "Is-
lam is of the Devil" shirts distributed to adults
and youth in the Dove congregation, said that
the shirts have actually
Alachua County done more good than
CommiSSion harm by helping chil-
dren raise tough ques-
tions and think critically. In the end, he said,
the issue is non-negotiable.
"Every good parent doesn't want their
child to go to Hell," said Sapp, whose three
children have worn the shirts to school. "We're
just doing what the Bible tells us to do."
Despite the public outcry, he said the
church will continue to speak out against Is-
lam and plans to address other controversial
topics like same-sex marriage and abortion,
all with the same vigor as the anti-Islam cam-
paign.
"Hey, it could always be worse," he said.
"They killed Jesus Christ for speaking out."I71

Sept. 12, 1984: Gainesville drops
from the FBI's top 10 most crime-
ridden cities list for the first time in
five years, ranking No. 36.
This is a stark departure from
previous rankings of third in 1979,
first in 1980 and fourth in 1981.Sept. 11, 1997: Gainesville is the
first community in the country to
earn an "energy-star" rating on one
of its homes, the highest ranking in
the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy's rating system, created in 1992.
Located at 410 NE 10th St., the
home was for sale at an asking price
of $75,000.
"While many houses are built to
just one step from illegal, this onewas renovated scrupulously," com-
munity developer Jim Notenstein
said. "This is a high performance
house. Nature benefits, and the
owner will benefit."
Sept. 9, 2000: The Oaks Mall is
overrun by cross-dressing pop-star
wannabes as fathers, boyfriends and
brothers come donned in schoolgirl
outfits for KISS 105.3's "Dress yourBrute like Britney Look-Alike Con-
test."
The contestants ranged in age
from 7 to mid-40s, and came dressed
in everything from wigs and red
leather jumpsuits to thongs.
Bradley Small, a UF student, took
home the grand prize.
"I was so surprised," he said, "I
heard it was a look-alike contest and
thought, 'I can't win this because I'mblack."'
Small, having best captured the
look and essence of Britney Spears,
won two front-row tickets and a lim-
ousine ride to her upcoming show
in Orlando.
"I can't believe how many dads
and boyfriends showed up," said
marketing director Lisa Demanuel.
"How many times do you get to see
this in Gainesville?"
Construction will
last into 2011
TRAFFIC, from page 1
The construction crew will begin removing
asphalt and old bricks later this week and early
next week, Windham said.
Crews are expected to begin the third phase
by the first of the year, which will include con-
struction between First and Depot avenues.
The work in the intersection of Main Street
and University Avenue is scheduled for two
weekends and will be done at the end of the
project, according to the release.
The project will also replace the storm-water
system from Depot Avenue to University Ave-
nue and replace some of the traffic light masts.
The road construction, which is designed to
increase pedestrian traffic and traffic safety, has
been "in the works" between 10 and 20 years,
Windham said, but she said was unsure of what
took the project so long to get going.
As for traffic, Windham said the construc-
tion will be an inconvenience, and drivers
should look for alternate routes when possible.
"There's plenty of ways around it," she said.
"Avoid it if you can."

Student Government's political parties wrapped up interviews
to fill the 50 open Senate seats at the Reitz Union Tuesday.

ily housing.
The Orange and Blue and the Progress Parties also have nearly
full tickets.
Orange and Blue Party President Kyle Huey said his party has
45 candidates running for the open seats and Nick Mildebrath,

Grad sews Game-Day garb
By GWEN RAHN of orange and blue," she said.
Alligator Contributing Writer
For some, orange and blue has merely be-
come a color combination sported on game
days or school-funded events. Though the
colors seem to consume Gainesville in an
array of fashions during Saturday football
games, two UF graduates choose to take their
love for orange and blue to the next level.
Fueled by frustration over what to wear
to football games her sophomore year at UF,
Natalie Kim launched her own Game-Day
dress line in 2005.
What started out as a part-time hobby for
the 23-year-old Ocala resident quickly blos-
somed into hundreds of requests for custom
and original dresses.
Word spread around Gainesville about
Kim's business venture, and by her senior
year of college, her line was picked up by a
local boutique.
Kim's dresses are now located in six dif-
ferent boutiques in North Central Florida, in-
cluding Allure Boutique in Gainesville. They
can also be bought online.
"I never thought I would make a career for
myself in fashion," said Kim, who graduated
UF last December with a degree in English.
"But this is what I love."
Kim's business allows the customer to
design her own dress, and each one is hand-
made.
Customers can visit her Web site and en-
ter their individual measurements to create
their own unique dress. Prices for the dresses
displayed on the Web site range between $60
and $120. Kim already has 40 different re-
quests for this season and is expecting more.
"My dresses help girls become individuals
at the games and stand out in the monotonyIn the past few months, Kim has branched
out, creating a garnet and gold line for Flor-
ida State University, a red and black line for
University of Georgia and an orange and
blue children's line. Louisiana State Univer-
sity and University of Alabama are next on
her list.
She plans to create a Game-Day dress line
for every Southeastern Conference school
and soon will be printing her own custom
fabric.
"I never thought I would make a ca-
reer for myself in fashion. But this
is what I love."
Natalie Kim
UF English graduate
"I could never steer away from this South-
ern charm. It just isn't the same anywhere
else," she said.
While Kim is creating fashions for Gators
lovers, Karley Croton, 24, a UF interior de-
sign graduate, is drinking from another cup,
literally. In June she started Tailgate Toddies,
a company that sells Gators-themed hand-
painted wine and martini glasses to make
tailgates more sophisticated. Each glass costs
$20.
"It is a fun addition to every tailgate, no
matter the age, and it makes tailgating seem
more like an event," Croton said.
Kim will showcase her dress collection as
the headlining designer for a Gainesville Fall
Fashion Week show today at 10:30 p.m. at
Sharab Lounge.
Kim and Croton's collections are available
at www.nataliekimgameday.com.Natalie Kim, left, and Karley Croton show off some of Kim's dress designs.
Schools follow vegetarian-friendly trend
0 U.S. SCHOOLS WITH VEGETARIAN
OPTIONS UP 40 PERCENT.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Step aside, Salisbury steak -tofu may
soon be king of the lunch line.
A recent study by the School Nutrition
Association found that two-thirds of school
cafeterias in the nation regularly offer a veg-
etarian option, a 40 percent increase since
2003.
Alachua County schools, no strangers to
the trend, are making it a little easier for the
vegetarian students who come through their
lunch lines.
Students were offered macaroni and
cheese with ham on their first day of school,
but a large vegetarian portion was set aside
at each school for vegetarian students, ac-
cording to Maria Eunice, director of food
and nutrition services for Alachua County
schools.
"We always have made vegetarian op-
tions available for students who request
them," Eunice said. "Recently, we've started
a vegetarian menu in some of our schools."
Eunice said one Alachua County high
school will offer veggie burgers in the lunch
line beginning in late September or early Oc-
tober.
If the veggie burger is well-received, the
faux-beef entr6e willbecome a frequent lunch
item throughout Alachua County, Eunice
said, adding that they will only be offered a
la carte because the veggie burgers cost morethan their beef counterparts.
"I think it's a good system to see whether
or not they need vegetarian options," said
Alyssa Cohen, a vegan and president of Ani-
mal Activists of Alachua. "I hope they keep
[the veggie burger]."
"Our kitchen managers know they al-
ways have to have something available for
vegetarians," she said.
That "something available" may be a tad
lackluster, however.
Around According to the Ala-Gainesville chua County secondary
schools' lunch menu for
September, there are only two days in which
a vegetarian lunch option is the main entree.
Vegetarian students can order from the
new vegetarian menu, which includes peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches, grilled cheese
sandwiches, bean burritos, cheese pizza or a
vegetarian derivative of the main entree.
"I think they're doing all they can," Co-
hen said. "It's not feasible to make every-
thing vegetarian."
Although it may not be possible to make a
batch of beefaroni vegetarian, the Profession-
al Academies Magnet at Loften High School
goes a little further than most schools when it
comes to offering healthy lunch-line options
for its students.
Eric Stubbs teaches Agriscience Founda-
tions, a class at Loften that allows students to
grow their own organic vegetables on a one-
third acre garden on school property.
Stubbs said the students eat their vegeta-
bles and share them with the school cafete-
ria -especially lettuce, which is used in the
school's salads."Most nutritional deficiencies comes from
a lack of fresh vegetables," said Stubbs, who
is also a vegan.
Stubbs points to the success of his veg-
etable garden as a way schools can improve
on offering more vegetables.
"We have served some of the produce
we grow in our cafeteria," Stubbs said. "I
think cafeterias still have a long way to go,
though."
Chris Cano, publicity coordinator for UF's
environmental vegetarian group, enVeg,
praised the new vegetarian menu in Alachua
County schools and the study's findings but
said schools should be doing more to edu-
cate students on the benefits of a plant-based
diet.
"It would be great to see schools offer
meals rich in vegetables instead of the stan-
dard mac and cheese and grilled cheese,"
Cano said.
The new trend in lunch-line vegetarian-
ism doesn't stop in primary and secondary
schools.
UF was ranked as the seventh most veg-
etarian-friendly university in the nation in
2008, according to a People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals poll.
UF, which placed 10th in 2007, offers veg-
an stations at both on-campus dining halls.
Eunice, a former vegetarian for more than
15 years, said she is working on making the
menus more nutritious and even more or-
ganic.
"I'm happy they're trying to do more for
vegetarians," Cohen said. "They could be do-
ing a lot more, but they could also be doing a
lot, lot less. But at least it's progress."Online album
was titled
'IRHA Bash'
IRHA, from page l
and the party was held in an execu-
tive officer's dorm, which is paid for
by UF.
In a statement to the committee,
the IRHA member who named the
Facebook album said the title was
never meant to indicate IRHA's spon-
sorship. Other members, including
Patricia Jordan, IRHA's president,
noted that no IRHA funds were used
for the event.
According to Loschiavo, this
wasn't the first time UF has looked
into a party after pictures of the event
were posted on Facebook.
"We've followed up on fraterni-
ties and sororities in that situation as
well," he said.
He said his office will take evi-
dence in whatever form it's avail-
able.
"If we become aware of a policy
violation, we don't look the other
way, no matter what the way of find-
ing out about it is," he said.

Bogus Boycot
Obama's speech did not
indoctrinate childrenSchools should have shown President Barack Obama's
speech on Tuesday instead of succumbing to parents
who wanted it boycotted.
The plan to broadcast a back-to-school speech was met
with controversy in some conservative states, most notably
Texas. Riled by conservative commentators who claimed the
speech would be steeped in political rhetoric, parents urged
schools to either not air the video or to provide an alternate
classroom for students who did not want to watch the broad-
cast.
Needless to say, the speech was what any sane person
would expect -an apolitical and policy-free encouragement
to get good grades.
To the people such as Florida Republican Party chairman
Jim Greer, who claimed that the speech was "indoctrinat-
ing" young minds with a socialist agenda, two things: First,
a speech that calls for young people to take control of their
futures is not a socialist speech, and second, both presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush gave addresses to the
school children during their terms in office.
Notice that not everyone who saw those speeches as a
child is a Republican. Were school children magically imper-
vious to "indoctrination" then, and today's school children
are not? What makes Obama more likely to "indoctrinate"
than any other politician?
However, the real problem with this controversy is not
what is being said aloud by conservative commentators. It
is the underlying cause of why they're saying what they're
saying.
A presidential speech to school children is about innocu-
ous as it gets, but people like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh
manage to rile up their legions of followers by making alarm-
ist cries about "indoctrination" and "socialism."
Does the outcry stem from blatant racism? Beck already
showed us how he feels about Obama and race in July. Other
pundits showed their reservations about Obama's heritage
by supporting the "birther" movement. We don't think that
the parents who protested the speech were necessarily racist,
but it is important to note that proven racists are provoking
them. If anything, the parents are probably just victims of
pundits set on vilifying Obama, no matter what he does and
no matter how illogical it is to do so.
Such outright disrespect should not be shown for our
country's highest elected official. What sort of message does
it send to children when their parents don't want them to
look at their president?
More importantly, students should not be taught to auto-
matically block out, boycott or walk into an "alternate class-
room" to avoid people they don't agree with. Schools that
boycotted Obama's speech based on the fact that the majority
of local parents oppose him ideologically are indoctrinating
school children to be close-minded, if anything.
If people are enraged at the prospect of their president
speaking to school children, it is a new low in Republican
nitpicking. We can only hope their next attack isn't launched
at Five Guys Burgers and Fries, the delicious establishment
Obama was caught patronizing on an NBC special in June.
After all, calling for a mass boycott of a speech to school chil-
dren is about as irrational and extremist as criticizing what
the president eats for lunch.

Guest column
Mideast trip reveals need for peaceInstead of working odd jobs,
getting an internship or taking
classes this summer like a nor-
mal college student, I decided to go
to the Middle East.
I spent the majority of my time
in the West Bank, even though the
U.S. Department of State advised
to stay clear of the Palestinian ter-
ritories. What I saw has completely
changed my views and understand-
ing of American foreign policy in the
Middle East.
When I arrived in Ben Gurion
Airport, I was supposed to be
picked up by an Israeli government
official.
When he failed to show up, I
called the only other person I knew,
a Palestinian government official
who lived about 30 minutes away
from the airport.
He informed me that as a Pales-
tinian, he was not allowed to travel
into Israeli territory, so I would
have to take a taxi. When I made it
to the checkpoint that blocked en-
try into the town of Qalqilya, I was
held up by Israel Defense Forces
soldiers, and after being rudely
treated and subjected to racist com-
ments about Arabs, I was permitted
to go through.
My hosts in the city of Qalqilya
were far more gracious than I ever
could have asked, and they refused
any monetary contribution.
They showed me how they live
their lives, complete with a wall
that surrounds their entire city.Travis Hornsby The IDF had
Speaking Out closed their li-
brary, and the
only thing to
do was to swim in a pool.
The men at the pool had scars
on their arms from when they cut
themselves during the period the
Israelis blockaded the city.
Their collective psychology is
something I cannot begin to under-
stand.
Following my stay there, I had
the opportunity to travel to all of
the major cities in the West Bank.
In Bethlehem, I was screamed at
by an IDF commander for getting
off our bus after we had been held
three hours without reason.
In Hebron, a girl in our group
was hit in the head by a rock thrown
by a right-wing Israeli settler, and
we saw a building where children
had been burned alive because their
house had been mistaken as a base
for militants.
In Ramallah, a friend showed me
where Mossad agents had gunned
down three men in the middle of
the street. I saw and heard evidence
and stories of violence that still
make me cringe, and the American
taxpayer finances the weapons that
do it.
I also got to go to the Israeli cities
of Haifa, Tel Aviv and Kfar Saba. I
heard stories about children dying
from bombs, though far less often
than in the West Bank.
I witnessed families being evict-ed from homes they have lived in
for 50 years in East Jerusalem, all
in an effort to remove Arabs from
the city that Israel wants as its un-
divided capital.
In my experience, the conflict has
generated a tribal mentality on the
part of Israelis, and many believe
the world is against them. Because
they are so few, they feel they must
respond a thousand fold when they
experience violence, as in the case
of Gaza.
The United States must resist the
policies of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and use all available
resources to press for peace in the
Middle East.
Israel can only be sustainable if
it comes to an agreement with the
Palestinians. It seems that violence
will bring only more violence, and
that a normal life for either side will
never be possible so long as both
peoples live under threat, whether
it is from a homemade bomb or a
fighter jet.
Even Hamas has said that peace
with Israel would be possible if it
allows complete Palestinian sover-
eignty in East Jerusalem, Gaza and
West Bank.
While the devil may be in the de-
tails, the Obama administration has
taken a position on the conflict that
will advance the cause of peace and
therefore the cause of Palestinians
and Israelis.

Letters to the Editor
Students ejected from game for no reason
I noticed the article in Tuesday's issue stated
that 51 people were ejected from the football game
Saturday. I was one of the nine people ejected from
the stadium for being in the wrong section.
What happened to me and many other students
was completely unlawful and wrong. I was sitting
in the correct seat and section in my group's block.
My friend sitting next to me was holding my ticket
for me.
An usher was going through our row checking
tickets, and when he got to me I told him that my
friend had my ticket in his pocket for my seat. At
that time, the usher forcefully grabbed my arm and
started escorting me out. He then proceeded to
take me to a room full of University Police Depart-
ment members as if I had done something wrong.
I then was forced to give my ID to an officer. The
officer started heckling me, asking me how to spell
my last name, city and etc., so he could try to ac-
cuse me of being intoxicated. To his dismay I was
completely sober, so he decided to just eject me for
the game.
Anyway, I'm writing this because I don't feel
what transpired on Saturday with me and many
others was right. On several occasions, there was
no precedence to the ejections. It seems to me that
from now on if you lose your ticket or accidentally
throw it away, then you'll automatically be ejected.
That is simply ridiculous.

On-campus restaurants gouge prices
I agree with Zach Mayo's stance on the restau-
rant situation at UF. At a place where I pay to at-
tend, you'd think my food would be somewhat
subsidized.
Instead, the opposite is true: At every eating es-
tablishment on campus, the price is hiked. In South
Florida I can get an entire meal from Pollo Tropical
for $3.50; here you may as well double it. I think
it's wrong of UF to take advantage of its students
by charging more simply because we have no other
options on campus.

Without patience, nothing gets solved
This is the first time I've written to the Alligator
in my four years at UF. I've thought about it many
times, but columnist Joe Dellosa's article about pa-
tience yesterday was the first time I actually felt
inspired to.
Though I haven't read any of David Foster Wal-
lace's work, I think the message of the article was
clear: We are a nation of impatient people. And the
Internet isn't the only place where that is evident.
We spend a week talking about pressing issues
like health care and then forget about it altogether
when it becomes boring. We can't even listen to a
full album of our favorite bands anymore because
it takes too much of our precious time.
We've become a nation of style with no sub-
stance. All of the crucial issues that America (and
the world at large) now faces can't be solved over-
night. They can't be solved in 140 characters or
less. Impatience is bigger than a lack of attention. I
know our generation likes to throw around terms
like ADHD and use Adderall to study for long pe-
riods of time, but ultimately we'll be remembered
for what we changed. And we can only change the
world one issue at a time.

UF adds
no-huddle
to tire out
defenses
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
The Gators offense didn't show
off many of its new features Satur-
day, but the one it did could give
opposing defenses the biggest trou-
ble.
Florida unveiled its version
of the no-huddle offense against
Charleston Southern -an idea it
stole from Oklahoma after strug-
gling to prepare for the Sooners'
fast-paced attack before the BCS
National Championship Game.
The last three seasons UF has
been in the top 25 in total offense
and points scored, increasing their
points per game each year.
It has been able to do so by con-
tinually adding new dimensions
to the offense. This year, the new
wrinkle is the no-huddle, and it was
put in to keep defenses off-balance
and tire them out.
"It gives you a
great sense of attack
in the offense and
Football keeps the defense
off pace, because
they've got to get
down and get right back up," UF
offensive coordinator Steve Add-
azio said.
Although the idea is to try and
get plays off before the defense is
set, the Gators will sometimes wait
to snap the ball to keep defensive
linemen from being able to antici-
pate the snap.
Charleston Southern struggled
to adjust to the up-tempo offense
and couldn't always get the right
personnel on the field in time.
"The best snap we had the other
day the defense had 13 men on the
field -they didn't call a penalty -
they had two guys running off who
hadn't gotten off yet, the chains
hadn't gotten set yet, the first down
markers hadn't gotten set yet,"
wide receivers coach Billy Gonzales
said. "That's the tempo we want."
Another way UF plans to use the
no-huddle to exploit defenses is by

Debose will have surgery, miss rest of season
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
Receiver Andre Debose will
have surgery to correct a ham-
string injury, and he will miss the
rest of the season.
Florida coach Urban Meyer
said Tuesday that the surgery will
re-attach a torn tendon, which De-
bose injured in a high school track
meet in the spring.
Debose was heralded as the
next Percy Harvin out of San-
ford Seminole High, and Meyergushed about his new addition on
National Signing Day, calling him
"the best player in America."
Meyer said he and Debose are
disappointed with the situation,
but they had to put long-term
goals first.
"He really wanted to play,"
Meyer said. "He was crushed, but
he also understands this is a mar-
athon, not a sprint, so he's going
to get it fixed."
With Debose out, there will be
more pressure on Brandon James
and Jeff Demps to excel at the du-
al-threat slot receiver position.THIN AT TE: The Gators have just
one tight end, Aaron Hernandez,
who will see playing time this
season, and
Meyer is hoping
to fill out the
depth chart
during recruit-
ing.
"We don't
play with that
Debose many close
tight ends, and
[depth is] one of the reasons,"
Meyer said. "We'd like to play
some more."We're recruiting tight ends
right now because we need more
of them."
The Gators currently have ver-
bal commitments from two tight
ends for the 2010 recruiting class,
including Gerald Christian, a
6-foot-3, 220-pounder from West
Palm Beach Dwyer High who
Rivals.com rates as the nation's
second-best tight end.
In the meantime, Meyer said
he will have to try and keep Her-
nandez fresh by leaving him off
special teams and utilizing the
fullback position more often.

UF struggles to find offense with inexperienced forward
* BURLEIGH HAS HAD TO SHUFFLE
THE LINEUP IN ELLIOTT'S ABSENCE.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
This past weekend couldn't have gone
much worse for the Florida soccer team.
Not only did No. 14 UF (3-2-0) drop itsmatches to Indiana and No. 6 UCLA, the
Gators' offense was nonexistent.
In the two losses, UF registered a com-
bined three shots on goal, and its only score
came on an Indiana own goal.
Coach Becky Burleigh said the team
couldn't find a rhythm in those games and,
five games into the season, she still hasn't
found a combination of players who play
particularly well together.
A few players cited forward Ashlee El-liott's absence as a key reason for the team's
offensive woes.
The Gators' formation consists of just one
forward, meaning whoever plays the posi-
tion has a tremendous impact on Florida's
offense.
With Elliott out for the season with a torn
ACL, Burleigh moved midfielder Lindsay
Thompson to the position. Last weekend was
the first time the sophomore ever played for-
ward in UF's system.

time Thompson, a former midfielder, played forward for the Gators.Thompson admitted she is not comfort-
able in the position yet, in particular the fact
that there are no teammates in front to guide
her on offense.
"Everything about (playing forward) is
different than being in the midfield position,"
Thompson said. "I'm just still trying to learn
the right ways and thing to do."
She said Elliott is giving her advice, in-
structing her to make a conscious effort to
secure the ball and be patient.
"(Elliott) is kind of like my personal assis-
tant coach on the sidelines," Thompson said.
Another Gator who is adjusting to a new
role is Lauren Hyde.
Although she was named to the All-South-
eastern Conference first team in 2006 and
2007 as a defender, Burleigh shifted Hyde to
midfield at the start of this season.
The switch was made so that Hyde, one of
the team's best players, could be involved in
Florida's attack.
She scored the first goal of her career on
a free kick against USF, but said she is still
unsure of herself at times.
That uncertainty was a factor in UF's loss
to Indiana, according to midfielder Tahnai
Annis.
"A lot of us were being too unselfish.
There were times in the game where I know I
had a good look or Lindsay (Thompson) had
a few good looks," Annis said. "And I think
that maybe we weren't confident enough in
ourselves."
Burleigh said her team's game plan is to
keep possession for as long as possible, forc-
ing opponents to chase the ball and become
tired.
Against UCLA, that plan did not work.
The Bruins controlled the tempo of the game,
and the Gators did the chasing for the most
part.Hyde said UF was intimidated by UCLA,
the only ranked team Florida has played so
far this year, and folded after giving up a goal
in the 51st minute.
"Instead of coming out stronger, we came
out like, 'Oh no, we don't want them to score
again on us,"' she said.
But even when the Gators played against
weaker opponents, they have not come out
strong and have yet to score in the first half.
Burleigh said the team simulates game
situations during practice, and they would
have to run if they didn't score in the first 15
minutes Tuesday.
Gators finish fourth after falling in consolation match

The UF women's golf team
placed fourth at the Hooters
Match Play Championships af-
ter losing to Virginia on Tues-
day.
The Gators lost 4-1 to the
Cavaliers in the consolation
match. Florida had advanced
to the semifinals by besting
Chattanooga 3-2 before being
edged by LSU, 3-2.
"They [the girls] wanted
to come out on top, but we
got outplayed," UF coach Jan
Dowling said. "But they were
ready to play today [Tuesday]
and that's really all you can ask
for. In the match against Vir-
ginia today it could have gone
either way, they made a lot of
putts, with two of our matches
we were within one."
Sophomore Evan Jensen
made an impressive showing
in the season's first touma-ment. At the top of the lineup
Monday, Jensen defeated Chat-
tanooga's Maria Salinas before
falling to Jacqueline Hedwall
of LSU.
Jensen was the only vic-
tor Tuesday, winning 4 and 2
against Virginia's Brittany Al-
tomare. Each golfer was up for
two holes until the ninth hole
when Jensen
took a four-hole
lead.
"Evan was
Golf such an even-
keeled player,
she never let too
muchbother her and she stayed
patient and hit some great shots
the past four days," Dowling
said. "I think the biggest factor
for her was that she made a lot
of putts for most of her rounds.
She always hits it well. This
week the putts were falling and
that was the difference maker
for two of our matches and also
in the stroke play. She led theteam very well this week."
Freshman Mia Piccio im-
pressed in her college debut,
taking a win from LSU and
just barely losing against Vir-
ginia's Eleana Collins, 2 up.
Piccio showed determination
after cutting a four-hole deficit
to two.
The only blowout defeat
Tuesday was Amelia Lewis' 7
and 6 loss to Virginia's Calle
Nielson.
"We're obviously disap-
pointed that we couldn't close
out our other two matches,
but again you can play well
in match play and still lose,"
Dowling said. "We started the
week off really well, winning
the stroke play portion; that
was a goal of ours and accom-
plished that. We have a lot of
positives to take from this week
and we have two weeks until
Vanderbilt, and we're going to
work on some things and get
better for next time."Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF sophomore Evan Jensen was the Gators' only win in their 4-1 defeat at the
hands of Virginia on Tuesday. Jensen went 2-1 in match play.

Bledsoe emerging
as efficient weapon
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer

Stuck in the shadows of a pre-
season All-Southeastern Confer-
ence Gators trio is a player who
leads her team in hitting percent-
age.
Right-side hitter Lauren Bled-
soe is not only tops on her team
in that category, she has quietly
posted a SEC-best .494.
"Everybody knows about the
right side attack that Kelly Mur-
phy provides and what Kristy
and Colleen can do, but Lauren
(Bledsoe) has just been under the
radar," coach Mary Wise said.
"However, she won't be under
the radar for much longer."
No. 4 Florida is second in the
SEC in hitting percentage and
Bledsoe has a lot to do with that.
She is the only Gator in the
conference's top 10.
As a junior, Bledsoe now feels
it is her time to step up and has
the confidence to make a bigger
impact.
"The first two years is kind of
just getting used to it and getting
acclimated," Bledsoe said. "So
now is the time when you feel
you can go above and beyond in-
stead of just being average."After only nine kills in her first
two matches of the season, she
hit her stride in the Florida State
match and rattled off 15.
She carried that success into
last weekend's tournament in
California where she totaled 25
kills and a .478 hitting percentage
in the two-match event.
It's not often that a right-side
hitter is this efficient.
Most of the
time it is only
middle blockers
who can boastVolleyball about these types
of percentages.
"Lauren (Bledsoe) came to us
with a lot of game and with one
of the best arm swings we've ever
had as a young freshman," Wise
said. "Now with a year of playing
with Murphy, her timing is good,
she sees the block and has a pro-
totype perfect technique."
Her play has made the work-
load of setters Brynja Rodgers
and Murphy a lot lighter as they
have averaged a combined 11.4
assists per set.
The emergence of Bledsoe on
the right side has given the set-
ters another hitting option.
Wise believes that the connec-
tion between one of her setters
and Bledsoe has helped elevateHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
Junior Lauren Bledsoe is leading the Gators and the SEC in hitting percentage through the early part of
the season. The opposite hitter is often overlooked as part of UF's deep attack.
the junior's game.
"Lauren (Bledsoe) and Kel-
ly (Murphy) have a real good
rhythm going right now and it
has taken Bledsoe's game to an-
other level," Wise said.
While everybody expected
outside hitters Kristy Jaeckel and
Colleen Ward to have good sea-
sons, Wise said Bledsoe is the oneshe calls upon the most when the
team needs a kill.
"She's our go-to and automat-
ic attack hitter," she said.
CUSACK NAMED SEC DEFENSIVE
PLAYER OF THE WEEK: This week
has been a memorable one for
senior libero Elyse Cusack.
While helping her team winthe Community Bankers Clas-
sic in Stockton, Calif., she was
named Most Valuable Player of
the event, moved into the SEC's
all-time top-five digs list with
1,713, and Tuesday she was
named the SEC Defensive Player
of the Week.
This is the 10th time in her ca-
reer she has won the award.

switching from a normal offense to it in the
middle of a drive.
The offense knows to get right to the
line with just a simple call from quarter-
back Tim Tebow. Tebow said when he
yells out "Banzai," the other players know
to get the no-huddle offense going.
To prepare for the rigors of the new
addition, the players had to increase their
conditioning.
"You have to be really well-conditioned
because it is so fast tempo, especially the
linemen and the receivers out wide who
are running back and forth and getting
back on the ball," Tebow said. "I think our
guys are getting used to it and we're grow-
ing more comfortable with it."
Even though the Gators debuted their
no-huddle offense, it gave future defenses

In so many ways, life is about luck
and timing.
Sam Bradford hurts his shoulder tak-
ing the same kind of hit he has walked
away from a 1,000 times.
Miami quarterback Jacory Harris
takes a hit against Florida State that
looked like it might knock him out of
the game. But unlike Bradford, he came
back to lead the Hurricanes to a game-
winning drive in the fourth quarter.
In the heat of the moment, LaGar-
rette Blount throws a haymaker that
ends his college career and could very
well derail Oregon's entire season and
the Ducks' conference championship
hopes.
Florida might be the most talented
team in the country.
They might have a once-in-a-genera-
tion quarterback. But just because this issupposed to be the Gators' year doesn't
mean it will be.
Florida has only played one game
this season but already there have been
breaks, big and small, that have put it in
a situation to do something special.
Brandon Spikes could be getting
ready for his first game in the NFL right
now instead of breaking down tape of
Troy.
Riley Cooper could be shagging fly
balls in Hickory, N.C. for the Texas
Rangers Single-A team instead of run-
ning routes in The Swamp.
Janoris Jenkins fought a group
of guys outside a bar and had to be
Tasered over the summer, but instead
of what could have been severe conse-
quences and missed games he walked
away with probation and community
service.
The Gators could easily be without
three of their best players right now but
they aren't.
And if the UF does go onto win its
third national title in four years, it won't
be without a few more open doors along
the way.Gators plan to expand use in future
only a small glimpse of what is to come.
Coach Urban Meyer said the banzai
package is still in the beginning phases,
and UF plans to expand on the one forma-
tion it used against Charleston Southern.
Meyer showed off one of his offense's
new tricks in its first
game of the year, but
most of his playcalling
was kept hidden, giving
defenses another thing
to worry about.
"We were very vanil-
la on offense, other than
Tebow tempo," Meyer said. "I
mean, bizarre vanilla,
painfully vanilla.
"But tempo, we have to practice it, and
we don't mind. It's out there and it's fine,
and we had to practice it. But if you looked
at our sets, there were three sets over the
whole night."
