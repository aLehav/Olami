� A JURY RULED IT WAS A 
JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.
The killing of a Gainesville man 
by an Alachua County Sheriff’s 
deputy was ruled justifiable by a grand jury Tuesday.
Nicholous Vertex Weeks, 18, 
was shot several times by ASO Lt. Mike Hanson May 15 after force and the use of a Taser gun did not stop Weeks from attacking the dep-uty.
Hanson returned back to work 
on May 27, after he was cleared by the ASO Office of Professional Standards, said ASO spokesman Art Forgey.
Forgey said Gainesville Police 
Department was hired to conduct the criminal aspect of the investi-gation, but its findings are not yet complete.
“Were glad it’s over 
with,” Forgey said. “There is no real win-ner. Now we have to 
pick up the pieces and move on.”
At around 12:50 p.m. the day of 
the shooting, GPD received calls about a man and woman fighting in a car at the intersection of North-west 34th Street and 39th Avenue.
Before GPD officers arrived at 
the scene, Hanson pulled up and tried to stop the fight.
After being Tasered, Weeks at-
tempted to grab the deputy’s gun. 
Hanson then shot Weeks several 
times, killing him on the scene, GPD spokesman Lt. Keith Kameg said. From about 9:30 a.m. to about 3 p.m., the jury listened to personal accounts of Hanson and the testi-monies of multiple witnesses, said State Attorney Bill Cervone. 
Cervone said the grand jury 
concluded that Weeks’ death was a 
justifiable homicide.

The UF Student Senate passed a 
bill Tuesday opposing the resolu-
tion proposed by President Bernie Machen to implement changes that 
will affect liquor licensing during 
the annual UF-Georgia game in Jacksonville. 
“Most people don’t want Bernie 
Machen telling them what to do,” Sen. Alan Yanuck said. 
Acting Progressive Party Presi-
dent Nick Mildebrath told the Sen-ate he has been petitioning for the bill at The Pita Pit.
Other senators have petitioned, as well. 
“Student Government has not 
done a strong job advocating for students,” Sen. Jonathan Ossip said. “I’m 
glad this year we were able to take a stance.” The Senate will send a copy of 
the bill to Machen, Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia Telles-Irvin and the University of Geor-gia Student Government Associa-tion president. 
 Much debate at the meeting 
surrounded a bill that proposed changes to online availability of SG records, such as cabinet members’ 
applications and resumes, which 
can currently only be accessed by SG officials.
The bill, a reworking of a past 
bill that would have given access to all students, would adjust online availability of SG records to incor-STUDENT LIFEOfficer cleared in shooting of local teen

Two local pool experts ranked the Reitz 
Union poolroom the No. 1 pool hall in Ala-chua County. 
Matt “Quick Draw” Sherman and Donny 
Lutz evaluated 12 billiards halls in Alachua County, criteria from a list in Robert Byrne’s 
Billiard’s Digest article “My Dream Room.” 
Sherman is the author of two books, “Pic-
ture Yourself Shooting Pool” and “Step-by-
Step Instruction for Successful Pocket Bil-liards,” and teaches a pool leisure course at UF.
Sherman, along with certified pool instruc-
tor and former UF pool league coach Donny Lutz, writes a monthly column called the “8-
Ball Debates” for Inside Pool Magazine. 
The article listed 23 specific criteria for a 
good poolroom, such as places for pool play-
ers to sit comfortably, spots from which some-one could watch a tournament and straight, adequate sticks for visitors to use. Reitz Union poolroom ranks No. 1

MIAMI (AP) — A South Florida town 
manager who married a porn star last year 
was fired at an emergency meeting after the mayor and council members found out.
Fort Myers Beach town council voted 5-0 
to fire Scott Janke “without cause” after May-or Larry Kiker called the Tuesday meeting.
Kiker said he learned that afternoon that 
Janke’s wife is an adult film star, and the elected officials took action hours later.
“At no time did we make a judgment call on the activities of Mr. Janke or his wife,” Kiker told The Associated Press.
Adult Industry News recently reported 
that Janke’s wife, Anabela Mota Janke, goes by the stage name Jazella Moore. Kiker said a clause in Janke’s contract permitted the council to fire him with a majority vote. He said he considers the Jankes friends.
“Our heads are held high,” Scott Janke 
said. “We have nothing to be embarrassed about. We’ve done nothing wrong.”Fort Myers Beach town council fires manager married to porn star � New Mississippi

Furry Taco Bell ad star 
Gidget dies at 15
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gidget 
the Chihuahua, the bug-eyed, big-
eared star of 1990s Taco Bell com-mercials who was a diva on and off the screen, has died. 
She was 15.Gidget suffered a massive 
stroke late Tuesday night at her trainer’s home in Santa Clarita and had to be euthanized, said Karin McElhatton, owner of Studio An-imal Services in Castaic, which owned the dog.
Although she was hard of hear-
ing, Gidget was otherwise in good health up to the day of her death, eating well and playing with her favorite squeaky toys at the home of trainer Sue Chipperton, McEl-hatton said.
“She was retired. She lived like 
a queen, very pampered,” McEl-hatton said.
Gidget was found at a kennel 
and wasn’t show quality, McElhat-ton said; she had an undershot jaw and huge ears. But Gidget knew she was a star, McElhatton said.
“She was a prima donna, basi-
cally. She absolutely knew when she was on camera,” McElhatton said.
In a 1997 Taco Bell television 
commercial, Gidget was seen as a male dog who, through the magic of special effects and a voice ac-tor, proclaims in a richly accented voice: “Yo quiero Taco Bell” — Spanish for “I want Taco Bell.” Viewers were charmed. 
What was supposed to be a 
single ad became a campaign that ran from 1997 to 2000.“We’ve been servicing more 
participants this year than last year,” said Josh Wadsworth, an employee at Job Junction, a non-
profit employment office funded 
by Goodwill of North Florida. 
He added that he was un-
sure if this was due to the wage increases or the economy in gen-eral. 
College graduates should re-
main unaffected, as they general-ly are not looking for minimum 
wage jobs, according to Wallace.

Equipment malfunction 
cuts short spacewalk
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. 
(AP) — Two astronauts cut short 
their spacewalk and hurried back to the safety of the international space station on Wednesday af-
ter a suit problem resulted in ris-
ing carbon dioxide levels for one of the men.
Mission Control notified the 
crew five hours into the space-walk that the canister for remov-ing carbon dioxide from Christo-pher Cassidy’s suit did not seem to be working properly. 
Flight controllers wanted him 
back inside quickly. 
That meant fellow spacewalk-
er David Wolf had to go back in early, too. Their battery replace-ment work outside the space sta-tion was left unfinished. 
Only two of four new bat-
teries ended up being installed.
Cassidy immediately headed for 
the hatch. He waited there for Wolf, who was farther out on the space station. 
Their work site was on the far 
left side of the orbiting complex, along the framework that holds the huge solar wings and more than 150 feet from the hatch.
“I’m just going to sit here, and 
I’m going to wait for Dave and enjoy the view,” Cassidy said.
Both men were back inside, 
and the spacewalk was more than a half-hour after Mission Control’s initial call to cut it short. It ended up lasting six hours, a WHAT’S HAPPENING?Red Cross Garage Sale

Minimum wage increases 
to $7.25 per hour
Floridian minimum wage work-
ers can expect a few extra pennies 
in their pockets starting Friday.
The state’s minimum wage will 
rise by four cents, from $7.21 to 
$7.25, in the second increase of the 
year. 
Traditionally, Florida’s mini-
mum wage has been above the federal requirement.
The state wage was raised be-
fore from $6.79 to $7.21 on Jan. 1.
Friday’s increase will keep the 
state minimum wage in line with the federal wage, as Washington finishes a series of small wage in-
creases.
Some economists believe an 
increase in minimum wage will 
negatively affect business. 
“Given the cuts in funding 
across the campus and the decline in business in general, the odds are that employers will be forced to re-duce the number of student hires, 
unless they are using a student to 
replace a full-timer who has been released,” said Wayne Wallace, a director of UF’s Career Resource Center. 
Despite economists’ claims of a 
negative pattern, some argue that a four-cent increase will have little effect. 
“I don’t think it’s going to af-
fect [employment] that much. It’s not that big of a deal,” said Rich-ard Stritkland, manager of the local Backyard Burger.
He added that his company in-
tends to keep its work force at 25 employees.
Similarly, many student work-
ers do not believe they will be af-fected by the wage increase.
“I get paid mostly from tip share 
so, while the increase in minimum wage is a great thing, it won’t di-rectly affect me as it will to those whose pay is strictly minimum wage,” said Melanie Lyon, a UF sophomore. 
It is debatable that the progres-
sive raise of the minimum wage squeezed the job market.

A list of finalists to replace Gainesville 
Police Chief Norman Botsford was re-
leased Monday.
The memo, written by Gainesville 
City Manager Russ Blackburn, was ad-
dressed to the City Commission.
The finalists include: Joseph Curreri, 
a Los Angeles Police Department cap-
tain; Craig Goralski, a Houston Police 
Department captain; Richard Hanna, a 
Gainesville Police Department major; 
Richard Lemack, former assistant city 
manager for the city of Hollywood, Fla., 
and previous assistant chief of police for 
the Hollywood Police Department; and 
Antonio Williams, chief of police for 
the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
In the memo to the commission, 
Blackburn explains that after receiving 
93 applications, the pool was narrowed 
down to 20 semi-finalists who met re-quirements including having eight years of senior-level command experience.
After discussing credentials and 
resumes in telephone interviews with 
each semi-finalist, the selection was nar-
rowed down to five.On Aug. 11 and 12, the finalists will 
be invited to attend a formal interview.
According to the memo, the inter-
view will include a panel interview led 
by Blackburn, one-on-one interviews 
with Blackburn and a community recep-
tion to allow Gainesville residents to get 
to know each of the finalists.
Blackburn said that he encourages 
residents to make suggestions of who 
they think would be the best candidate 
for the position.Candidates named in

After initially saying no, UF is giving wa-
ter pong a second shot.
On Wednesday, the Center for Student 
Activities and Involvement approved student 
group A Spring of Hope’s plan to host a chari-
ty water-pong tournament on the Reitz Union 
north lawn after initially denying its request for a permit because it resembles beer pong and because water-drinking contests can be dangerous or deadly.
“There have been students who have be-
come ill or even died from consuming a large amount of water,” said Beth Waltrip, UF’s di-rector of campus programs.
The policy also extends to eating competi-
tions, she said, with several permits for wing- or hot dog-eating contests denied over the years.
UF officials also frown upon activities that 
promote heavy drinking, she said.
“The university [makes] a very specific ef-
fort to try to discourage binge and underage drinking among students,” she said.
In the fall UF passed changes to the Student 
Conduct Code that ban drinking games, kegs and activities encouraging the “rapid, exces-sive consumption of alcohol” on campus.
UF President Bernie Machen has also made 
his opposition to binge drinking clear and has recently tried to get the city of Jacksonville to limit alcohol sales during festivities at the an-nual UF-Georgia game.
But Nancy Chrystal-Green, director of the student center, said the issue was more about the dangers of a water-drinking contest.
“There’s really no regulation that says that 
we can ban events that resemble [beer pong],” she said. “That wasn’t the concern.”
Jonathan Ossip, president of the group 
hosting the tournament, said the group has al-ways maintained that students don’t actually need to drink the water in order to compete. The group held a water-pong tournament last year with the same rules, he said.
Chrystal-Green, however, said that wasn’t 
made clear on the group’s permit this year.
Ossip said he’s glad UF finally allowed the 
event, which will raise money to build wells for schools in rural Africa. Last year, the event raised between $200 and $300, but Ossip said he expects to raise more this year because he has recruited sponsors like Domino’s Pizza 
and Gainesville Health & Fitness Center Inc.
The wells cost between $2,000 and $10,000 
to build, he said.
Ossip said the tournament is popular with 
students, who pay to compete, resulting in 
more money raised through entry fees, dona-tions and the sale of T-shirts and bracelets.
Ossip said the group met with UF officials 
five times before the initial denial was over-
turned.STudEnT lIfEPanel OKs water-pong

The Florida-brewed beer Magic Hat No. 9 was added to the selection at Moth-
er’s Pub on University Avenue. The pub is one of the first few to serve it.
By ROBERTA O. ROBERTS
Alligator Writer
A bewitching new brew has shown 
up on University Avenue.
Mother’s Pub & Grill, 1017 W. 
University Ave., is the only bar in 
Gainesville, and one of four in the 
state, that has been selected by Ver-
mont-based Magic Hat Brewing Co. to serve its newest concoction — Mag-ic Hat No. 9, a “not quite pale ale,” ac-cording to TJ Goodman, co-owner of the pub.
Mother’s will host a party Friday 
night to formally introduce Magic 
Hat No. 9. 
Burgers and chicken wings cooked 
using the beer will also be available, 
Goodman said. 
Other towns in Florida hosting the 
specially brewed beer include Talla-hassee, Ocala and the Tampa/St. Pe-tersburg area.
Goodman said 
the ale is unique 
and indescribable.
“It’s like Sierra 
Nevada,” he said, “but it has a flow-
ery, fruity taste afterwards. It really is hard to explain.”
But despite its hard-to-determine 
flavor, Goodman said it has been suc-cessful with customers in its first week 
after becoming available in the bar.
“We had one keg — about 110 pints 
— gone within three hours, which is 
unbelievable,” he said. 
He also said the new specialty beer 
is going to change a lot of things.
“A lot of college students will go 
from buying $1 drinks and jump to buying $3 and $4 drinks, which is 
unheard of in today’s economy,” he 
said.

chance to try something different oth-er than Bud Light, Miller and Coors.” Pub one of few to serve rare brew

On June 8, KC Hagan took the Law School 
Admission Test in hopes of being accepted to the 
Levin College of Law.
But though more students will apply for a posi-
tion in the college than last year, Hagan will com-pete for one of 100 fewer spots than in 2008.
According to The Princeton Review Web site, 
only 36 percent of all LSAT test-takers are admit-ted to law school each year. UF’s law school only accepted less than 9 percent of its applicants for the fall class of 2009
Noemar Castro, director of admissions for the 
Levin College of Law, said that for the fall 2008 class, the college received 3,369 applications and admitted 400 students. 
This year, the college re-
ceived 3,430 applications but will reduce the number of stu-dents they enroll by 25 percent, enrolling only 300 applicants 
for the fall 2009 semester.
Castro said the law school decreased its admis-
sions in an effort to implement a quality-not-quan-
tity approach for the future. 
“It’s extremely competitive,” she said. “We 
have definitely seen an increase in applicants for this year.” 
Castro said people are interested in attending 
law school because a law degree provides options 
and also prepares students for the workforce.
She predicts an even higher number of applica-
tions for fall 2010, she said, because students who 
finish undergraduate programs will have a tough time finding jobs and look to law school as an op-tion.
Hagan, a 21-year-old advertising senior, took 
LSAT prep classes in April.

NEW YORK  — The Naked Cow-
boy wants to be the city’s mayor, 
promising transparency in politics — while running almost buck naked.
“I know how to do more with 
less,” said entertainer Robert Burck, clad as usual in a pair of white briefs, boots and a cowboy hat, as he announced his bid Wednesday in Times Square.
On most days, the 38-year-old or-
dained minister collects tourists’ tips while posing for photos with “Na-ked Cowboy” emblazoned across 
his underwear, cracking jokes and 
making up funny songs on the guitar strapped across his bare chest.
He’s running as a write-in can-
didate against Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a buttoned-down bil-lionaire vying for his third term.
The Naked Cowboy insists he 
doesn’t need clothes to campaign.
“You’re not going to be seeing 
me buying a whole new suit because I’m running for mayor — not on the city’s dime,” he said.
Besides, he said, “Being naked 
is a whole lot more than having no clothes on: It’s about transparency in politics, it’s about telling the naked 
truth.”
Last year, the Naked Cowboy 
called Bloomberg “an excellent 
choice” for mayor. Now, Burck says that he, himself, would be the better candidate.
“I go out into the public every day 
and deal with every type of person in the world — black, white, brown, 
plaid,” Burck said.
For the past decade, he’s earned 
as much as $1,000 a day working the 
square from about 
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and donating some earn-ings to charity.
Burck has a political science de-
gree from the University of Cincin-
nati. He’s also written several self-
vpublished motivational books and cut a country music album.
On Wednesday, he reeled off 
his promises as mayor, including $10,000 loans to 1,000 small business-
es at no interest, energy efficiency (he 
doesn’t use air-conditioning), and taxi call buttons on street corners. He also wants to build a Times Square chapel, marrying both straight and gay couples there in a “billion-dollar wedding business that will rival Las Vegas.”Naked Cowboy runs for NYC mayor in his underwearTHURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 5

If you’ve got any lost library books, now’s 
the time to find them.
After a new policy goes into effect Aug. 
17, students may have less time after the 
due date to return a book before UF charges 
them for the cost of a replacement.
Currently, lost books are replaced when 
librarians get around to buying the new books, said library spokeswoman Barbara 
Hood.
So some lost books aren’t back on the 
shelf in a timely manner, which prompted the change, Hood said. 
Under the new policy, the library will in-
stitute a fixed schedule for book replacement, 
and as soon as the new book is ordered, the 
one who checked out the book will be re-sponsible for paying for it, she said.
The new policy states that 21 days after 
the due date, the library will charge borrow-ers a $35 processing charge per item for gen-
eral loans. The next day, 
the replacement item will 
be ordered, and the bor-rower will be responsible for the cost of the new item, in addition to the $35 
fee.
The other late fees will 
remain largely the same. 
For general loans, it will still cost 25 cents per 
day after the due date until the maximum overdue fine kicks in after 20 days. That fine, 
however, will now be $5 instead of $10.
From July 1, 2008 to May 13, the library 
reported 728 lost books at the Smathers Li-braries, which at the time didn’t include the Health Science Center libraries or the law school’s library.
Those books had a combined cost of 
about $50,000, Hood said.
During the last school year, UF students, 
faculty and staff checked out almost 220,000 
books, she said.

One hundred  years ago on July 17, 1909, Sen.  William 
E. Borah (R-Idaho) wrote, “The income tax is the  fair-est  and  most equitable of  the taxes. It is the one tax 
which approaches us in the hour of prosperity and departs in the hour of adversity. Certainly, it will be conceded by all 
that the great expense of government is in the protection of 
property and wealth. There is no possible argument founded in law or in morals why these protected interests should not bear their proportionate burden of government.”
Within two years of Sen. Borah’s pronouncement, Wis-
consin enacted the first state income tax. Several other states followed suit as a wave of Progressive Era reforms led many states to replace their ailing property taxes with more pro-gressive and effective income taxes.
 By contrast, the first functional sales tax was enacted in 
Mississippi during the dark days of its segregationist history in 1932, in part as an effort to shift taxes off of the wealthy and politically powerful landowners, and onto the backs of blacks and poor whites. Several states followed, and while their reasoning may have been less offensive, it’s clear that legislators have known since the beginning exactly who is most impacted by a sales tax. As states across the U.S. grap-ple with budget cuts this year, choices are again being made that will affect families everywhere. States including New Jersey, New York and Oregon are taking the more progres-
sive path and opting for the addition of new tax rates at the 
top of their income tax structures. Over the coming months and into early 2010, states will continue to debate these two paths as they struggle to meet their respective shortfalls. 
The choice should be clear.Unlike the income tax, so eloquently described by 
Sen. Borah, the sales tax falls like a hammer on families  
during their hour of greatest adversity. That’s because it’s based on how much we spend, not how much we earn.  There are many situations where one can spend more than 
they earn for months or even years: someone who takes an 
extended time off work to take care of a sick parent; college students relying on loans; a family struggling for months af-ter a plant closing; an entrepreneur in the first critical years of a new business venture; and a family that chooses to live on just one income during its new 
child’s formative years. In all these family realities, as spend-
ing outpaces income, the sales tax has its greatest adverse 
impact. In more streetwise language, the sales tax gleefully kicks you when you’re down. 
Meanwhile, there are those at the top of the income 
scale whose millions are scarcely touched by the sales tax. Much of their income is used to acquire more wealth with the purchase of stocks, bonds and real estate investments. Unlike the “purchases” most of us make every day, these  
are tax free, allowing wealth to snowball. Even their attor-
ney fees and landscaping services are generally free of the 
sales tax. According to a report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, “The average state’s consumption tax structure (sales and excise) is equivalent to an income tax with a 7 percent rate for the poor, a 4.8 percent rate for the middle class, and a 1 percent rate for the wealthiest taxpay-ers. Obviously, no one would intentionally design an income tax that looks like this — yet by relying on consumption tax-es as a revenue source, this is effectively the policy choice lawmakers nationwide have made.” 
And so, under a sales tax, income at the top that more 
often finds its way into speculation or idle savings remains virtually untouched, while the income of the far-less-wealthy, which moves swiftly and consistently back into our local, state and national economies at a time when we  
need it most, is taxed at the highest possible level.
 If our elected officials are serious about strengthening the 
middle class and fostering a more broadly shared prosper-ity, let them take a moment to consider the wisdom of our forebears. Great truths, like the words of Sen. Borah, stand the test of time and can help us make wise and just decisions 
when facing the challenges of today.

The 11 million monthly subscribers of World of Warcraft 
will actually have a reason to leave their apartments/bunkers/caves of seclusion for something other than Bawls, Hot Pocket re-ups and foam sword-fighting equipment as soon as 2012. Sam Raimi (of “Spider-Man” fame) has announced that he will 
be directing a feature film all about the horde. We were into 
RuneScape back in middle school (one of us even required an intervention), but we would like to throw a DART at Sam 
Raimi for making a movie about a game that has sent many 
past acquaintances into a veritable abyss (presumably with Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Ruben Studdard and Carmen de la Pica Morales). Raimi proved that he’s a master of cheese with “Drag Me to Hell,” but we think he’s actually serious with this one. In a word: Wow. 
Speaking of tools, a burglar seems to have found the perfect 
instrument to do his dirty work. Guys, it’s a monkey. Security tapes show what appears to be a monkey stealing hundred of dollars worth of merchandise from Plants and Planters, a store in Richardson, Texas. We would like to send a LAUREL 
to as-of-yet-unapprehended burglar for channeling “Murders 
in the Rue Morgue” (sans the part in which a dismembered corpse is shoved up a chimney) and pinning his crimes on a blameless animal. Anything that gives us a chance to reference 
the great Auguste Dupin deserves a laurel; plus, dudes, it’s a 
monkey. (You guys like animals, right?)
After initially denying a student group’s request to play 
water pong for an African charity, the Center for Student Ac-
tivities and Involvement has now decided the event is OK. According to a UF official, the concern about the event came from the fact that it resembles a certain drinking game (rhymes with “Donkey Kong”) and that drinking water in excess can result in injury or death. The Department of Darts & Laurels 
would like to throw a DART into the cups of those who work 
for center, firstly for not being able to make up their minds and 
secondly for not realizing that people only die in water drink-ing contests when a Nintendo Wii is involved. (Seriously guys, we don’t work for them). 
Reluctance would be understandable if the student group 
wanted to pull a reverse “Mad Max” and drink gasoline be-cause apparently that makes your IQ drop. A 14-year-old boy 
from Yibin City, China, who has been reportedly drinking 
gasoline for the past five years in order to resemble his idol, 
Optimus Prime. We wanna throw the kid a LAUREL for fol-
lowing his dreams, but also sort of a DART because, accord-ing to the kid’s mom, he has damaged his brain to the point that he can no long perform simple addiction, I mean addition, and subtraction. Our indecisiveness doesn’t really matter in this situation, given that he probably can’t read. In fact, we feel this way about a lot of the Darts and Laurels this week. What have we really written about? People that can’t stop looking at 
gnomes and mages long enough to read a newspaper, a mon-
key and a kid who can’t add seven and 17. Oh boy.
Well, we realize that we only did four this week, but, as 
we’ve said, we are nursing some killer hangovers. As our part-ing words, we would like to gloat about beating the computer with a pint of Heineken. On Rainbow Road. Let it be known! And also, have a good weekend. No drinking and driving (un-less the driving is virtual).Brian Miller

Amazon should allow buyers to own books
What concerns me is not the technology itself, but 
this growing concept that individuals don’t own the 
data on their own storage devices.
They could have easily designed the Kindle to let 
you purchase and download the e-books, and after that immediately stop keeping track of the book because it’s no longer their damn business.
They did not, and I’m glad to see Amazon.com get-
ting bitten in the ass for it. I like Amazon.com, and I hope they learn from this.

Congress should take time to pass bills
The author’s comparison breaks down for the fol-
lowing reason: There was plenty of debate as to wheth-er landing a man on the moon was worth the expense. 
But there was no debate on how to do it. That was left 
to the engineers who understood the problem.
With today’s issues, most everyone agrees on the 
sort of thing that should be done (with the likely excep-
tion of climate change), but there are strong disagree-
ments about how to do things. Having Congress (most of whom have little to no practical experience in health care, climate science, finances, etc.) rush through mas-sive spending bills may not be the best thing. Many 
would argue that this path is sure to cause more harm 
than good.

Community colleges are colleges, too. 
While it may be easy to forget that fact at a large 
research university, President Barack Obama re-
cently announced a plan that recognizes the importance 
of community colleges. 
He’s proposing a 10-year, $12 billion investment in 
community colleges to improve their ability to educate 
America’s workforce. 
The plan, called the American Graduation Initiative, 
sends a message from the Obama administration that it 
hasn’t forgotten about those for whom a bachelor’s de-gree at a four-year university isn’t a realistic possibility. 
It’s Congress’ job to reinforce Obama’s admirable 
commitment to community colleges by passing the ini-tiative.
Obama announced the initiative on Tuesday at Ma-
comb Community College in the nearby Detroit suburb of Warren, a blue-collar town hit hard by the recent eco-nomic meltdown. 
Obama proposed a number of methods that would 
improve community colleges nationwide by helping 
them provide online courses and modernize facilities. 
The AGI pledges to make earning an associate degree 
easier. 
The group encourages merit-based scholarships and 
classes that work around students’ full-time schedules.
Obama’s goal is an additional five million associate 
degrees by 2020. 
The AGI will be funded by an elimination of subsidies 
the federal government pays to banks that run student loan programs, which Obama proposed in April. 
Now it’s Congress’ turn to follow Obama’s initiative 
and make it happen — because Obama was right when 
he said that jobs requiring a college degree would grow 
faster than jobs that don’t. 
This is especially true for Michigan. 
As the state loses its manufacturing base, its future 
will depend on job growth in fields that require college degrees. 
But getting a college 
degree to enter a new 
profession isn’t easy 
for workers who’ve already been in the manufacturing 
workforce for years and can’t afford to go to school full time. 
And it isn’t easy for students whose families have 
been hit hard by the economic downturn and can’t af-ford a four-year degree.
With college tuition rising across the country, the need 
for quality community colleges is greater than ever. 
Community colleges could offer affordable schooling 
for people who need it — and Obama’s AGI could drasti-cally improve the quality of this affordable education.
Community colleges provide essential educational 
opportunities and ensure that our workforce can change with the demand for jobs.
And improving the accessibility of community col-
leges will help this happen. 
Giving tools for community colleges to design pro-
grams around work schedules and provide online cours-es will help students already in the workforce. 
The option to train for a job in a high-growth field 
while maintaining a full-time job will entice more to take 
advantage of this opportunity. 
And because the federal government is paying for 
these improvements, community colleges will be able to 
keep their tuition low — something that all universities need to do better.
Community colleges provide an education for people 
who can’t afford a four-year college education or are looking for an alternative to  to a big university.
Obama’s new plan to bolster such important institu-
tions could help bring the U.S. out of its economic slump, and Congress should ensure this becomes reality.

Monday’s band practice was a 
downer for Tony Farah.  
The bass player couldn’t believe 
it might be Chupaskabra’s last time 
playing in the living room they use 
to rehearse for shows, he said.
The local ska band will perform 
a free concert alongside The Dup-
pies at Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza Friday. The concert will be 
the group’s last for a while, band members said.  
“We just need a break from it, 
I guess,” trumpet player Blaine 
Garvin said.  “We’ve been playing 
the same stuff for two and a half years.”
However, the seven-piece 
band’s decision isn’t unani-mous. Some of the members feel they could easily continue Chu-paskabra, Farah said.
When Chupaskabra churned 
out its happy-go-lucky, horn-backed rendition of pop-punk at Free Fridays last year, the group at-tracted an audience of about 400.
David Ballard, the plaza events 
coordinator, said attendance at Free Fridays has gone up significantly this year, continuing a trend.
Both Ballard and the band agree 
it’s the family friendly atmosphere that attracts the large, diverse 
crowd, encouraged by an alcohol-
free environment.
“It’s cool because you see peo-
ple there that you would never 
normally see at shows,” tenor sax-
ophone player Neil Soule said.
Members of Chupaskabra, all 
students at either UF or Santa Fe College, grew up in Gainesville and 
created the band in high school.
They knew they made it big 
when they opened for The Know How, another local ska band, at the 1982 venue in 2006. It was their 
first show.
“I think we owe a lot of our 
success to that first show because there was such a large audience to see The Know How,” Farah said.
But it wasn’t just the luck of 
a first show that’s lasted them through a successful few years.
Their appreciation for music 
and classical training inspired them to offer a show with raw tal-
ent and fun music. The band mem-
bers agreed to stay away from fog machines and colored lights.
“We’re all about the music,” 
Garvin said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009

Looking through the world’s largest telescope is 
like seeing something with four million eyes.
The telescope, which was built out of a joint 
effort by UF astronomers and astronomers from 
Spain and Mexico, will be inaugurated Friday by 
King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain at the 
Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma, Canary Islands. 
The telescope, named Gran Telescopio Canarias, 
has the latest technology and instrumentation, in-
cluding more light-collecting area than any other 
in the world, said UF astronomy professor Charles Telesco.
Large telescopes usually have one mirror that is 
distorted by gravity when tilted, he said, but GTC’s mirror is a mosaic of 36 hexagonal segments that can be readjusted to prevent deformation. 
The telescope also features a $3.3 million, heat-
sensing camera called CanariCam, which was de-
signed and built by UF engineers and scientists, he 
said.
On the island, air sweeps smoothly across the 
Atlantic Ocean, and there are no topographical fea-
tures to cause turbulence, Telesco said.
The telescope, which rests on building only 20 
feet shorter than the Statue of Liberty and whose 
base can hold the weight of 62 elephants, is located atop a 7,874-foot mountain, with clear, dry weather 
that allows for high-precision images.
UF and Mexico each own 5 percent of the GTC, 
and Spain owns 90 percent, said Stan Dermott, chairman of UF’s astronomy department. 
The university contributed about $5 million to 
the $180 million project.
The project is part of the campaign to interna-
tionalize the university, according to Dermot. 
Although this ownership commits the university 
to 5 percent of all expenses, it also entitles the as-tronomy department to about 20 days of observa-tion each year, Telesco said. 
The privilege of guaranteed access was the main 
reason for joining the project, he said.
“It was natural for us to get involved in this 
Spanish telescope because of the Hispanic connec-
tion we have here in Florida,” Telesco said.
Eric Ford, assistant professor in the department 
of astronomy, was one of the first to make observa-tions with the GTC.
From Gainesville, he instructed experts at the 
site to perform operations and send the images to him over the Internet. 
The uncertainty of using a new telescope made 
the experience suspenseful and exciting, he said.
“It’s really nerve–wracking,” Ford said. “You’re 
checking every little detail every five minutes, and 
you know you’ll either make it or break it.”
But the observation turned out a success, he said. 
A Jupiter-sized planet following a nearly circular 
orbit around a star was observed. 
According to Ford, the telescope will primarily 
be used to learn about the formation and evolution of planets and to gain an understanding of how the solar system fits into the universe. 
He also mentioned studying young stars, the 
center of galaxies, black holes and star-forming re-gions surrounded by dust.
The key hope is to find something that is un-
known to mankind, Dermott said.
“This university has a desire to be a top 10 state 
university,” he said. “For that desire to be met, it is essential that we involve ourselves in top-notch projects like this one.”UF ACADEMICS

“Where do you torpedo?”
Answering that question just might win UF engineering 
junior Blake Matson $10,000, a year of free Quiznos torpedo 
subs and a chance for his video to be televised nationally.
Matson is one of 10 finalists in the Quiznos “Where Do 
You Torpedo?” video contest, which was designed to raise 
publicity for Quiznos’ new $4 Toasty Torpedo sub. 
His video, “The sandwich you can’t let go,” features Mat-
son as pink-shirted, pink sunglass-clad “Bryce.” 
In the video, Bryce drives a convertible with sub in hand 
while telling the passenger he torpedoes “in his sports car doing 120, with the windows down 
and the top rolled back,” just before the Quiz-
nos Toasty Torpedo sub shoots off into space, 
rocket-style before landing in his hand. 
In order to win, Matson’s video must receive the most 
online votes before the July 31 deadline.
Voters are automatically entered into a contest to win free 
torpedo subs for a year, according to the contest Web site. 
He said he entered the contest to make a video, and the 
competition was an added incentive.  
“We wanted to make a video and maybe get recognition 
for it,” he said.
He said he wanted to begin his video “kind of lame” and 
finish with something big to throw judges off. 
Matson, who shot the video with Florida State University 
student Johnathan Greenaway, said if he wins he will take 
his friends on a vacation and possibly buy a hybrid car.
But Matson, who is the only one visible in the video, 
doesn’t plan to hog all the winnings.
“Johnathan plans to buy a motorcycle,” he said.

It may seem stilettos are the 
most serious foot-pain offender, 
but it’s summer’s favorite shoe that’s now getting the blame. 
The American College of 
Sports Medicine determined wearing flip-flops is harmful to feet, legs and lower back when worn as primary footwear.
Floridians may be harder hit 
than most, with all-year sunshine allowing flip-flop wear year round. 
“Flip-flops give no support for 
the arch, so there is some flatten-ing in the feet overtime,” said Dr. Scott Koppel, a podiatrist from North Florida Family Podiatry in Gainesville.
Flip-flops increase the chances 
for ankle sprains, and Koppel  recommends when purchasing sandals to avoid funky or really 
thick soles, which can be hazard-
ous, he said.
“The best choice is to wear an 
athletic shoe when you can,” Ko-ppel said.
He advises his patients to 
wear either New Balance or Asics brands because of their support-ive soles. 
Most flip-flops lack supportive 
soles and make people change 
the manner in which they walk or run. 
When wearing them for too 
long, they can cause pain, ac-
cording to the American College of Sports Medicine. 
The average American takes 
between 10,000 and 20,000 steps day, and small changes to a per-son’s gait can escalate to a serious 
injury. 
Although summer’s go-to 
shoe may cause pain, Cayce Con-
nolly, a UF junior, says she won’t stop wearing her favorite type of footwear.
“Flip-flops are so comfort-
able and they make my feet look good,” Connolly said, while sporting a pair of Rainbow flip-flops during an interview.
“I always see people on cam-pus wearing flip-flops, probably because it is so hot and they just want some breezy feet,” she said. 
The American College of 
Sports Medicine recommends re-placing flip-flops as often as pos-sible and not wearing them for an extended period of time or for 
long distances.10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009

High Springs Police Chief James Troiano 
will not resign, despite union demands, he 
said Wednesday.
A union representing the police officers 
of High Springs called for the resignation of Troiano in a letter addressed to the mayor Monday.
The Florida Police Benevolent Association 
Inc. cited a survey that found morale at the police department “very low.” Respondents blamed this on the chief, calling him “belliger-ent and unfair.”
The survey also found that “rules and reg-ulations are not applied equally to all employ-ees” and “favoritism is shown by the agency,” according to the letter.
“I am not going to resign. I am not being 
fired. I am absolutely committed to the best level of leadership for this department,” Troia-no said.
Of the 12 surveys sent out, nine were re-
turned.  Each said if they could change one thing at the agency, it would be “to get rid of the police chief,” according to the survey results released by Reddish & White, CPAs, 
which conducted the survey for the union.
In a press release Tuesday, City Manager 
James Drumm defended Troiano, saying he 
“has not done anything warranting his res-ignation, and [I] have no intention of asking [him] to resign on the demand of staff mem-bers.” 
He added that “the appointment of the po-
lice chief is not a popularity contest.”
Troiano is concerned 
about the survey’s timing, he said.  The city is cur-rently in negotiations for a three-year labor renewal 
agreement with the union.
“We stand committed to 
continue this negotiation in 
good faith,” Drumm said in the release.
Troiano doubted the survey’s methods.  The union sent out 12 surveys, but only 10 offi-cers in the department were eligible to receive them, Troiano said. One was received by an 
officer who is not a union member.
The letter accused the chief of unfair disci-
plinary practices, but Troiano said he has for-
mally disciplined only one officer in his tenure. That officer divulged confidential information to someone outside the police force. Out of the maximum penalty of 160 hours suspension, Troiano removed the officer for one day.
“I can’t see how [that] would be ‘unfair and 
not in line or scope with what should be ex-pected,’ as the union claims,” he said.  
He added that “the true feelings of many in 
the police department were not heard.”

■ DANCE HELD IN MEMORY 
OF PROFESSOR’S FATHER.
By BRITTNEY BURGETT
Alligator Contributing Writer
A Santa Fe College professor 
hopes to raise money for the Leuke-
mia & Lymphoma Society this Sat-
urday in memory of his father.
The Larry G. Shahboz Memorial 
Summer Swing Dance will be held 
at the Thelma Boltin Center from 8 
p.m. to 11 p.m. 
“The dance is going to be a lot of fun, and it’s for a great cause,” said Marc Shahboz, SFC digital media 
professor and host of the event.
He and his wife, Joyce, have been 
swing dancing for about four years 
and are members of UF’s Florida 
Swing Dancing Club. 
Shahboz said his aunt and his 
father inspired him to begin swing dancing.
His father, Larry, was an avid 
swing dancer who died in 2005 from Multiple Myeloma, a type of leuke-
mia, and his aunt, Judy Martin, was 
his father’s dance partner and a sur-vivor of Leukemia.At the Boltin Center,  516 NE Sec-
ond Ave., there will be dancing les-sons and demonstrations for those who want to learn, which will start at 8:30 p.m.
“You don’t have to know how 
to dance in order to 
come,” Shahboz said. 
“The whole point is to get the commu-nity together, have a 
great time and help out a wonderful cause.”
Essie Jennings, a second-year 
animal sciences major at UF and president of the swing club, said many of the club’s members will at-
tend and added that the dance “will 
be a blast.”
Jennings said the swing club 
has always wanted to participate in 
charitable events but has never had 
the funds to do so.
This is the first year that Shah-
boz is hosting the event and plans to hold more in the future. 
He said he thinks this will be the 
perfect way to commemorate his fa-ther.
“My dad was a very charismatic 
guy,” he said. “He would have loved this event and would have been the first one on the dance floor.” 
The Shahboz family is covering 
all costs including renting the center and paying for the refreshments. All of the money that is raised will go 
directly to the Leukemia & Lympho-
ma Society’s North Florida Chapter.
Local restaurants like Bento Cafe 
and Stonewood Grill and Tavern have also donated gift certificates to raffle off and raise money for the 
cause.
Tickets cost $10 for general ad-
mission and $7 for students and can 
be purchased online at http://shah-boz.com/swing/. Summer swing dance to benefit leukemia societyTroiano

porate all SG senators.  “We were being over 
cautious,” said Mildebrath, who said he supports access for all UF students. “But we realize that’s not necessary.” 
But some senators are still pushing for 
universal access for UF students.
Yanuck said that keeping UF students 
from accessing the online applications and resumes is against a Student Body statute. 
“If we [deny universal access], anyone 
can sue the university,” Yanuck said. 
But Judiciary Chair Ashton Charles said 
it would be within SG law and more ben-eficial if the system changed to include all senators, not all UF students.
The bill was postponed for further dis-
cussion until next Tuesday’s meeting. 
The senate also addressed plans for the “Safe Gator” campaign, which will aim to prevent muggings and robberies in 
areas like College Park and 
Sorority Row. 
SG is partnering with 
the University Police De-partment and Gainesville Police Department for 
the project, Press Secretary Eric Conrad an-nounced.  
Senate President Pro Tempore Suzanne 
Hersman said Senate President Audrey 
Goldman will be out sick and she will act as 
president until Goldman’s return.
Mildebrath also announced during the 
meeting that the Progressive Party is now on Twitter and can be followed at ProgressUF.
“We’re following that trend, as well,” he 
said. UF’s poolroom scored 14 out of 
the 23 points. 
Sherman and Lutz both said 
that a reason why poolrooms sometimes close after only a few years is failure to adhere to the cri-teria on the list.
Two students from UF who are 
competing for the national title in the Association of College Unions International Collegiate 9-Ball Championship use the Reitz Union game room to practice.
Monica Fox and Heather Platter 
are competing against each other in the tournament, held in Nor-mal, Ill., where they will face up to 32 other women for the title.
The women will post Facebook 
updates on the tournament, which 
ends tonight at 6 p.m.
 “There are never fights be-
tween drunk people, it’s smoke 
free and it’s a great way to meet friends,” Platter said of the Reitz Union game room.
 “In all seriousness besides 
school and work, pool is all I re-ally do,” she said, adding that she 
would love playing professional 
pool one day.
Though Platter only began playing pool two years ago, she said she is a natural
“Everyone says I have a huge 
talent,” Platter said. “At my be-ginning stage, I naturally knew 
how to hold a pool stick and shoot, which people usually don’t know how to do.”
Sherman instruct-
ed Fox before the competition, and she said she feels ready to com-pete.
“I am fully prepared to get 
down to business,” she said. 
Sherman said the tournament is 
important in the pool world. “The players are all non-pro, 
but even though all the players are in college, it doesn’t mean they are young with only a couple of years of experience,” Sherman said. “You 
could be playing against a 40-year-
old man that is in law school, who has played for over 20 years. The competition is very fierce.”
Gainesville poolrooms Art of 
Billiards and J P Gators ranked No. 2 and 3 respectively on the list.
Art of Billiards owner Dana 
Rogers said her poolroom offers 
things that the Reitz can’t—alcohol 
and smoking. 
Her billiards hall hosts about 25 upper-level tournaments a year, including a monthly 9-ball tour-nament and professional tourna-ments.
Rogers said the hall also pro-
vides a good environment for fam-ilies during the day.
“I think it’s a blast to have fami-
lies come in with their children to play,” she said. “We have a lot of fun.”
Art of Billiards also hosts six 
shooters who have played in pro-fessional tournaments in Las Ve-
gas.
J P Gators wasn’t available for

 Ask any band to classify its 
music, and its members are likely 
to give a thoughtfully drawn-out list of categories. A band’s sound 
never ﬁ  ts into one simple genre.
Colourslide is no exception.
”It’s more of a melodic rock,” 
guitarist Dean Newman said.
Alex Lawhon, the band’s 
lead singer, jokes that it sounds like Celtic music with a hip-hop twist.
”I guess if you wanted to sub-
categorize it though, it sort of has a Britpop gloss to it,” Newman said.
After several moments con-
templating different bands with 
musical similarities (U2, Cold-
play, REM, Counting Crows, the Killers), drummer Steve Julian comes to a conclusion.
”Our music is deﬁ  nitely rock,” 
he said.
On Saturday, the band will perform at Common Grounds. 
After spending the summer 
touring across the east coast, the band is returning to its home-
town to perform in front of some 
familiar faces. 
The band formed three 
years ago when the trio met through a mutual friend and 
producer in North Carolina, 
where Lawhon belonged to a different band named Melbourne. At the time, Ju-
lian and Newman played 
in a Gainesville band called Time. When Time broke up, the guys recruited Lawhon to be the new singer. 
The band members’ previ-
ous bands laid a groundwork on which Colourslide was able to build on. 
The band’s ﬁ  rst performance 
was at the Florida Music Fes-tival in Orlando, an event that provides bands an oppotunity to meet and network with each other and spark connections with 
people in the industry. 
Since its debut, the band has 
played with music big shots 
Natasha Bedingﬁ  eld, Tom Petty 
& the Heartbreakers, Cheap Trick 
and Blind Melon. The tours have taken the trio to venues spanning from Washington, DC, to New York City. 
“It’s hard to go that far away 
and have a huge fan base, but we did pretty well in New York,” Lawhon said.In New York, the song “Wake-
Up Call” won the band $20,000 as Maxell Song of the Year in the 
John Lennon Songwriting Con-
test. 
“The award allowed us to do 
some of the most amazing 
things we have done to date,” 
Newman said.
The band’s plans for the 
future remain short-term, as they await the outcome 
of their upcoming album, 
which will be released in the fall. 
The guys want to get it 
out and receive enough ex-
posure to allow them to pursue a record label in the future.
”The album has a name al-
ready, which is amazing,” 
Lawhon said. “It’s called ‘Every-
body’s Right About Everybody.”
Picking titles, especially ﬁ  nd-
ing a band name, is not a fun 
task, Newman said. The guys pondered over a daunting list be-
fore making a decision.  
Colourslide came to Lawhon’s 
mind through a song by Swedish band  Kent. 
The band spells color with a 
‘u’ because it feels the word is 
more eye-catching. 
“If you get to a certain size, it 
doesn’t matter what your name 
is,” Lawhon said. “No one dwells on what the Smashing Pumpkins 
means. They just know who the 
band is.”
Though its popularity isn’t 
at a Smashing Pumpkins size, 
Colourslide hopes it is only a 
matter of time before people will focus on the music it plays, with-out deliberating the band’s name or musical classiﬁ  cation. 
“Eventually we’d like to sign a 
label and get really big,” Newman said. “Hopefully our next album gets us the exposure we need to 
really launch our career.”

Ostrich, kangaroo, ‘gator and rat-
tlesnake are not items typically found 
on a Mexican restaurant’s menu, but Boca Fiesta can hardly be considered a traditional Mexican restaurant.
The restaurant, which opened this 
summer and is located downtown,  at 232 SE First St., touts a unique menu and a continuously blossoming social 
atmosphere.  
With a co-founder who spent the 
last eight years playing drums in one 
of Gainesville’s most revered bands, Against Me!, and a name that trans-lates to “Mouth Party,” how could one not be intrigued? 
Boca Fiesta’s co-founder, War-
ren Oakes, toured the world several 
times over with Against Me!. Along 
the way he has tasted food from doz-ens of countries - from putrefied shark in Iceland, to kangaroo in Australia. 
The decision to become a res-
taurateur came to Oakes during his time traveling and perform-ing with Against Me!  
“Food and music have always 
been my two passions,” Oakes said. “A realization came early on that you have to eat multiple times a day, every day for the rest of your life, so you might as well enjoy it and do it well.”
Oakes always had an idea of the 
type of establishment he hoped to 
open, but being so consumed with 
music, the implementation escaped him, which is where co-owner Jacob Ihde stepped in.  
“He has opened restaurants be-
fore. He won a silver medal at the Pizza Olympics last year,” Oakes said. “He’s got quite a food service pedigree under his belt.” 
Oakes planned to split his time 
between recording and touring with Against Me!  and opening the doors at Boca Fiesta. But he soon discovered he would be spread to thin. 
“It wasn’t going to be feasible to 
do both simultaneously,” he said. 
To avoid short changing either 
project, Oakes chose to commit to the 
restaurant.
“I had a really good run playing music. I spent eight years touring and 
recording and really living that life fully,” Oakes said. “It felt like that it was time for a new chapter, so I just threw myself into this completely.” 
The co-owners chose the restau-
rant’s Tex-Mex concept because they felt downtown Gainesville lacked a Mexican restaurant that serves mar-
garitas and features a full bar.
“We decided to make a place that 
we would want to go to,” Oakes 
said.  
The menu, which was created 
with Florida in mind, makes Boca Fi-esta unlike any Mexican restaurant in town. 
“A lot of places don’t really do the 
fish taco justice,” said Oakes. 
Rather than using imported, fro-
zen fish, Boca Fiesta imports fresh tilapia every other day and adds the spices in house.   
“We have ‘gator on the menu all 
the time,” he said. “We realize we’re right in the middle of The Swamp, so 
it’s not just a novelty game day spe-
cial that we do. You can get a ‘gator burrito, a ‘gator taco, any day. It’s whatever you want.” 
He has found many patrons have  
their first taste of ‘gator meat at Boca Fiesta and end up loving it.  
The non-traditional food items 
span far beyond ‘gator tacos.  The 
restaurant features a monthly “Game 
Menu,” with select wild meats that changes every 30 days.  
The locale featured ostrich in June 
and kangaroo through July, and in August rattlesnake will be swapped into the menu. 
 The Game Menu was inspired by by the many meats Oakes tasted dur-ing his world travels. 
“Everyone is so used to chicken 
and cow and pig, and that’s pretty much as far as it goes for them,” he said.  
Kangaroo meat is low in choles-
terol and cosuming it helps the envi-ronment. 
“They are dangerously overpopu-
lated in Australia right now, so it’s ac-tually encouraged to consume them as livestock in order to shift the focus away from cows and lamb and other more traditional meats,” said Oakes. 
The game meats are also rich in 
flavor. 
“You don’t need to suffer through 
eating this weird meat to be good to the planet. They stand out on the 
taste aspect as well,” he said.
While meat is a staple item on 
the menu, Boca Fiesta welcomes carnivores and herbivores alike.  “The tempeh is a living food and has a great flavor to it,” Oakes said.
The house tempeh is made in 
Gainesville and brought in daily.      Customers can also create a vegetable protein taco, burrito or taco salad. Commonly known as TVP, most restaurants mix it in with ground beef to cut costs. But, 
Boca Fiesta serves TVP by itself as a ground beef mockup. 
“A lot of people love it. My dad 
is a meat eater, and the TVP taco is his favorite thing on the menu,” said Oakes.  
Boca Fiesta’s business will soon go 
beyond serving up tacos and marga-ritas, as it begins to embrace down-town Gainesville’s nightlife.The res-taurant already screens movies in its 
courtyard and Oakes hopes to soon 
make live music a staple. 
“We have a band lined up to play 
soon as sort of a test run,” he said.
Warren wants Boca Fiesta to be a 
place where patrons can enjoy down-town as a place to go for something other than raving and clubbing. 
“It feels like that idea [clubbing] 
is represented 10 times over,” Oakes said. Oakes shifts focus to food industry

Twitter users chat during a tweetup at Shooting Star on July 16. The event is a meet-and-greet spread 
by Twitter users through their networks. 
Demi Moore stopped a desper-
ate suicide attempt by re-posting an 
ominous message. A University of California, Berkeley student evad-ed Egyptian prison by posting the 
word “arrested.” And Gainesville 
residents who had never met in per-son partied together at a local Japa-nese restaurant. 
Though seemingly unrelated and 
in different corners of the world, these events have one thing in com-mon — Twitter.
The Gainesville Tweetup, a gath-
ering of people who are friends on Twitter, was held at Shooting Star, 203 SW Second Ave., on July 16. 
Michelle Hipps, a 22-year-old UF 
graduate, got the idea for the event when she saw a tweet about a meet up for Twitter users in New York City.
“The tweetup is for both person-
al and professional gain,” she said.  “I get to meet the people I’ve been tweeting with and I’d also like to make some professional contacts.”  
    Hipps said that Twitter is not just a 
way to spit superficiality in 149 char-acters or less, like others say it is. To her, Twitter is more about what peo-ple are thinking and not about what 
movies they like or what books they’ve read. The content is less im-
portant than the actual thought pro-cess of a person writing a tweet.
Hipps said her generation is not 
as superficial as the ones that came before it. People now want to delve deeper and find out if they think the 
same way or share the same ideals.
“What Twitter is really asking 
you is, ‘What are you thinking?’ 
‘What’s capturing your attention?’” she said.
Twitter provides a good medium 
for college grads to network with companies looking for new talent, especially in the field of media and 
communications.
“Twitter is great for networking,  
“Hipps said. “It’s amazing for net-
working.”
At the event, a crowd of about 
25 people drank beer, cocktails and enjoyed free appetizers from 6 to 8 p.m., at the second of what Hipps hopes to be many future Gainesville 
tweetups. The first event was held 
at Stubbie Shirt Pub in downtown Gainesville about a month ago.       
Brian Smith, 28, video opera-
tions supervisor for UF, came to the event to network with other local Gainesville tweeters.  Smith  thinks Twitter is a socially acceptable way to meet friends, as having met the people through tweets provides an instant ice breaker. Twitter allows users to create a personal connec-tions as they go along, as opposed to 
Facebook, where you already have 
that personal connection.    
Twitter is different from other 
social media sites in that there is no profile to look at, no persona to delve into and no pictures to browse. 
Twitter accounts are simple. 
On Twitter, you get to know people through their tweets.  
    “I’ve met some good contacts and 
made a few decent friends out of it,” he said. 
Smith met Gary Ritzenthaler, a 
PhD student in mass communica-tion at the UF,  at the first tweetup. The men found out they were col-leagues and have since become good friends. 
“Now when I see him around we 
have something to talk about,” he said.

sex on the avenueBinges won’t mend a broken heart  
It’s 3 a.m., you’re piss-drunk, out of breath, roll-
ing among sweat-stained sheets and incapable of 
sleep.  No, you’re not in the thrusts of a one-night stand; you’re dealing with heartbreak after being served a monogamist’s worst fear: the breakup.
Face it, even in the promised land for the pro-
miscuous,  known to many as college, sometimes you become inexplicably drawn and committed to another.  As graduation nears and your significant other considers staying up all night studying Anat-omy 101 with that friendly classmate, someone is gonna get the boot.
This is made increasingly worse if your rela-
tionship was built on love; it’s no coincidence love 
is also a four-letter word.  If you’re unfortunate 
enough to find yourself in this scenario, then you might believe your non-beating heart was just pu-réed in a blender.  When in water this deep, there’s no quick fix and those Vicodin pills aren’t gonna help you much, either.
A lot of newly single people go on weeklong 
benders, complete with Lindsay Lohan-esque downward spiral. Booze and drugs will numb you.  
But eventually they wear off and then the memory 
of your ex is sure to hit you harder than a run-away RTS bus.  Couple that with a study-impairing hang-over and pretty soon you’re failing a freshman class like Marriage and Families.
One of the best things you can do post-breakup 
is evading the former apple-of-your-eye.  This in-cludes screening their calls and texts because, like Gwen Stefani, you’re just too damn busy “walking 
into spiderwebs.”
Taking a leave of absence from Facebook won’t 
hurt either. Facebook has a cruel sense of humor, 
and Mark Zuckerberg somehow knows your dat-ing history; so you can look forward to mini-feed posts indicating your ex is having an impressively easier time getting over the relationship.  You don’t want to see that, and you deserve better.Packing away memen-
tos and reminders is a healthy idea.  No need for a ritualistic burning of the 
sheets you shared, but your 
ex-lover’s picture sitting within eyesight of your bed can go.
It’s crucial to work out 
your feelings and gain clo-sure.  Over-priced therapy is unnecessary — this is 
what your friends are for — lucky, lucky them.  
But avoid drowning in self-pity and, even if you’re 
a borderline-masochist, stop wondering what could’ve prevented the breakup.  Breakups happen for a reason and you. just. need. to. move. on. 
Then comes the questionable process of re-
bounding.  As hard as it might get, avoid hooking up with people before you’re ready.  
Should you wake up next to a reasonably attrac-
tive classmate and still want to gnaw your arm off 
in an attempt to escape his or her bed, you’re prob-
ably not ready to be seeing other people. Occasion-ally the perfect stroke your ego needs will consist of your friend Cuervo, Miami’s finest “herbal rem-edies” or a sultry one-night-stand,  just don’t go too crazy.
Mostly, take time to yourself.  Pick up a sport, 
take on a project or focus on your upcoming exam. Treat yourself to regular gym visits (endorphins are 
nature’s anti-depressants), lounge by the pool and 
take your Visa on a field trip to Gucci.
Looking better than your ex is the world’s most 
just revenge, so those days at the gym and pool will pay off when inevitably finding yourself in the oh-FML pathway of your former partner.  While they’ve clearly gained a belated Freshman 15 and have a stage-five clinger hanging on their arm, your toned and golden body is about to give them whip-

There might be a backup at 
confessional come Sunday, due 
to The Network Promotions Sin-City-style pool party Saturday. 
“Diosabella’s Ed Hardy Fash-
ion Show and Pool Party is an event you won’t want to miss,” said Glenn Cameron, co-owner 
and general manager of the Net-
work Promotions. “This event will be one of the most unique events to ever hit Gainesville — welcome to GainesVegas!”   
At the event, fashion models 
will strut the latest Ed Hardy fashions down a poolside cat-walk, a hip-hop dance group  
will perform, DJ Pop Rocks will 
spin and security will be in place to ensure everyone’s safety. 
The party will run from 2  to 
6 p.m., at The Enclave Apart-ment’s pool. The event is free and will include free drinks, food and clothes courtesy of Di-osabella’s Fashions.  
“If you look down at your 
wardrobe and you say ‘Hmm, I dress like a peasant,’ then come out here to the pool party. You don’t have anything else to do — come get some free Christian Audigier Ed Hardy gear,” said guest model Greg Halstead of the Real World Hollywood’s on 
his video invite.
Diosabella’s Fashions is a de-
signer boutique based in Las Ve-
gas. The owners recently opened a store in Butler Plaza and will be providing the models’ attire and free Ed Hardy shirts, hats, bathing suits, skim boards, jeans and purse giveaways. The store has teamed up with the Network Promotions and The Enclave Apartments to give Gainesville a 
little taste of lusty Vegas. 
“Our events are geared at 
giving students the best college 
experience possible,” Cameron said. “We aim to bring those crazy college parties in the mov-ies to life.” 
Within the last year, The Net-
work has thrown many parties. 
Currently it hosts Friday nights 
at Rue Bar, and the weekly prof-its go toward putting on its infa-mous pool parties. The Network hosted the Cinco De Mayo pool party at the Enclave, the Blink Fashion show at Gainesville Place, the Jefferson 2nd Avenue rooftop parties and the evening 
Lexington Crossing pool parties, 
with each attracting more than 2,000 scantily clad bodies.
“The Network throws the 
best pool parties. Game over,” Halstead said.  
The Network has a social 
networking site, thenetworkpro-motions.com, that allows party-
goers to stay connected and re-
ceive drink specials, a place on VIP lists and free entry to any Network party. The Enclave hosts

ATTIYYA ANTHONY � AVENUE WRITER
Brandt 
Williams
ColumnistThe pages of Elle, my favorite 
fashion magazine, were one of the 
last places I’d expect to find a flash-back to my middle-school days. 
But there it was, wedged between 
the trend reports and style advice, I was sent back to eight grade where everyone conformed to a perfect social stereotype. The cliques were grouped according to who you hung out with, what music you listened to, and most importantly, what you wore. 
There were “Punks,” “Preps,” 
“Hippies,” “Gangsters,” “Goths,” and “Nerds” — labels I now use with reservation. If you didn’t fit into one of those, then you were a “nobody,” which therefore account-ed as a group of its own.  
I remember feeling almost lim-
ited in what I was allowed to wear either because of judgment from my peers or fear of The Force, otherwise known as our school dress code. Any middle schooler was fashion-ably doomed and guaranteed a spot in either one of the  aforementioned stereotypes. Or even worse, they 
could be defined as a poser, the cruel 
word that stamped “fake” on your forehead.
Now there it was again; printed 
in Elle magazine were current trends influenced by classic stereotypes. 
Today, the fashion industry is re-
defining what it means to be a poser. Unlike middle school, this industry is not afraid of what people are go-ing to be labeling them or saying behind their backs. From design-ers and celebrities, to Gainesville’s fashion scene, the clothes people are turning to to break the standard ste-reotypes. 
Here are, five popular trends that 
were once “off-limits” to some and are now available for all.   
1. Geek chic
Nerds everywhere are enjoy-
ing their revenge by proving that they too have a stance in the fash-ion world. One of the most buzzed about accessories are oversized, 
thick-brimmed, fake glasses that 
change the derogatory term “four-eyes” into a compliment.2. Tie-dye/ Bleach Stains
Today, wearing a T-shirt with 
an infusion of colors doesn’t neces-sarily mean you are a peace-loving, psychedelic drug user. Brands like Free People work to produce cloth-
ing for people looking for individu-
ality in the clothing they wear. This mellow, earthy energy is turning up everywhere — on dresses, purses, button-downs  and jeans. 
3. Studs
Studs in all shapes and sizes 
are embellishing the most basic of pieces. Forever 21 displays sandals smothered in silver studs or leath-er bracelets decked out with rows 
of 3D pyramids. Five years ago I 
would have reserved these items for either the punk rockers with electric blue hair or some S&M contraption, never expecting studs and spikes  to stylishly decorate a light pink tank top or a girly handbag.
4. Stripes
Preppy is a trend that always 
has and always will exist. Scholas-tic stripes are being borrowed from the Preps in order to make an edgier statement. The would-be-basic cot-
ton T-shirt is turning chic, adorning 
parallel lines in black and white or varying stripe width and direction. 
5. Simplicity
In middle school, these were the 
kids who wore jeans and a white T-shirt, steering away from any sort of fashion conformity — the “no-bodies.” In the fashion industry, 
infamous basic tees hold a level of 
sophistication that cannot be de-nied. There is something confident and sexy about a crisp white T-shirt teamed with your favorite pair of jeans. 
These trends make it clear that 
outside the hallway walls, there is an adult world still influenced 
by its adolescent days, a world 
where fashion boundaries are being crossed and social borders are being THURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Mississippi State head coach and former UF offensive coordinator Dan Mullen speaks to reporters during a 
news conference at SEC Media Days in Hoover, Ala., on Wednesday.

HOOVER, Ala. — Missis-
sippi State took Dan Mullen out 
of Gainesville, but the Bulldogs hope Starkville doesn’t take the Florida out of Dan Mullen. 
The Gators’ former offensive 
coordinator had a lot to say on what to expect from a program that has been to only one bowl 
game since 2001 and an offense that ranked last in the Southeast-ern Conference 
in scoring (15.2 
points per game) 
a season ago. 
“If you turn on a game film, 
watch a team, all 11 players on the field on any given snap, play with a relentless effort, play with a passion for the game of football for 60 minutes of that game, then 
we’ll have a successful season,” 
Mullen said. 
One of UF’s team slogans 
implemented by coach Urban Meyer is “four to six seconds of relentless effort,” and Mullen 
said he is intent on bringing that 
hardworking, focused attitude to his new squad. 
In a 15-minute interview 
with MSU junior K.J. Wright, the linebacker used the phrase “re-lentless effort” three times when describing the new goals for the Bulldogs. 
Terminology, however, 
isn’t the only thing that made the nearly 600-mile trip from Gainesville to Starkville, Miss.
The Bulldogs will switch 
from a run-heavy offense to the spread Mullen and Meyer made famous in The Swamp, and Mul-len, who is looking to emphasize 
special teams play, will be the 
team’s special teams coach just as Meyer is for the Gators. 
The 37-year-old coach has 
also brought the “Champions Club” with him in hopes of holding players accountable on and off the field. 
It seems the only things he 
didn’t bring with him are the Mullen brings UF 
style to Miss. State

HOOVER, Ala. — All eyes in Fayette-
ville, Ark., are on sophomore signal caller 
Ryan Mallett.
The Michigan transfer redshirted last 
year and will now take the reins of Ar-
kansas coach Bobby Petrino’s pass-happy 
offense.
“One thing Ryan can really do is throw 
the deep ball,” Petrino said. “If we can run the ball better and run the ball more consistently, it should open up our deep passing game and our ability to get the ball down the field.”
Mallett threw for 892 yards and seven 
touchdowns in 11 games as a true fresh-man for the Wolverines during the 2007-08 season. He played sparingly as a back-up to starter Chad Henne but threw for three touchdowns against Notre Dame in his first career start. 
“He’s got one of the strongest arms 
I’ve ever seen,” tight end D.J. Williams said. “In practice, I’ve got to bring a cou-
ple pairs of extra gloves because he tears the gripping off with his passes.”
Arkansas went 5-7 last year in Petrino’s 
first season at the helm, and quarterback 
Casey Dick threw more interceptions (14) than touchdowns (13).
Now the Hogs are hoping that Mallett, 
a quarterback tailor-made for Petrino’s pro-style offense, can right the ship.
“He’s just as accurate as he is pow-
erful, and he’s going to be a great quar-
terback to watch next year,” Williams said.
At 6-foot-7, Mallett 
towers over the line of scrimmage. But at 265 
pounds, his mobility in 
the pocket was limited 
last year.
The sophomore has 
shed close to 30 pounds 
since his arrival in Fayetteville, and Pe-trino is confident that a more mobile Mal-lett is the key to running his system ef-fectively.
“In this league, with the defensive ends 
we face, the speed and athleticism of the defensive fronts, it’s important that you SEc FOOTBALLArkansas prepares new QB
HOOVER, Ala.
Afew weeks ago, which of these 
would you have thought Tim 
Tebow had the best chance of be-
coming?
A) A two-time Heisman Trophy win-
ner.
B) A three-time national champion.C) A unanimous selection to the pre-
season All-Southeastern Conference first team, as voted by the coaches.
No matter how lofty your expectations 
for Tebow and the Gators this season, op-tion C definitely looked the safest. Until 
the All-SEC team was announced earlier 
this month, that is.
Tebow came up a vote shy of being 
a unanimous pick, denying one of the game’s best-ever players a distinction that 
Tennessee corner Eric Berry, Alabama re-
ceiver Julio Jones and LSU lineman Ciron Black earned.
I’m not going to 
waste time trying to justify why Tebow 
deserved a unani-
mous selection, because that’s like 
gathering a bunch 
of evidence to prove 
to someone the sky 
is blue or grass is green.
It’s not really a huge injustice either, but 
it does say something interesting about 
the coach who didn’t vote for Tebow.
Four candidates were eliminated on 
Wednesday, as Arkansas’ Bobby Petrino, 
Vanderbilt’s Bobby Johnson, Mississippi State’s Dan Mullen and Kentucky’s Rich Shredding suspects around 
Tebow’s robbed All-SEC pick
Today’s question: Who do you think didn’t vote for Tebow as their First Team All-SEC QB?� The Gators recently updated their

 In two years at the helm of the 
UF women’s basketball program, 
Amanda Butler has turned in one of the best turnarounds in school his-
tory (2007-08) and a top-10 ranking 
en route to a return to the NCAA Tournament (2008-09).
That beckons the question: Where 
will Butler’s Gators go from here?
The upcoming season will cer-
tainly be an uphill battle with the depar-ture of four seniors 
(Sha Brooks, Kim 
Critton, Marshae Dotson and Aneika Henry). 
The 2008-09 Gators tied a pro-
gram record with 24 wins and set a new school mark with a 15-game winning streak. 
Brooks was the team’s go-to 
player on the wing, while the 5-foot-11 Dotson was one of the best under-sized post players in the country.
Butler has shown the ability to 
make her players continually ﬁ  ght, but the Gators only managed a No. 4 seed in the Southeastern Conference Tournament with one of their most talented teams in recent history.
One reason was UF’s 7-5 road re-cord. And despite the gaudy overall record of 24-8, the Gators failed to show up to play on certain nights — losing at Florida Gulf Coast and at home against Arkansas.
But even without two of their best players in recent history, the Gators could still be a talented team.
Three-point specialist Jordan Jones, a South Carolina transfer, is eligible after sitting out last season. Rising senior guard Jennifer Mos-sor is back after missing most of last season with a torn right ACL. Rising sophomore Trumae Lucas earned more playing time as her freshman campaign wore on and will likely 
ﬁ  nd a starting spot in the backcourt. 
Butler did well on the recruiting 
trail, signing 2009 Ms. North Caroli-
na Basketball Christal Caldwell. The 5-foot-11 guard led West Charlotte High to the 2009 4A state champi-onship. Joining her in the back-court will be 5-foot-7 guard Tessah Holt, who was named The Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution’s 2009 Georgia 
Class 4A Girls’ Basketball Player of the year. The Gators also signed 6-foot-2 forwards Jennifer George and Lily Svete.
The Gators will now have ﬁ  ve 
players taller than 6 feet, compared to two in Butler’s ﬁ  rst year.
This year’s schedule has not been 
released, but it was announced that UF will play at Rutgers on Dec. 7.
It’s certain to say that the Gators 
will not sneak up on anyone after their two-year revival. They have outperformed preseason expecta-tions the last two years in the SEC.
Now as the bar gets higher, will 
UF be able to keep topping it? How will women’s basketball respond after two years of success?Top 10 Burning Questions for 2009-10

 UF women’s basketball coach Amanda Butler will have her work cut out for her as the Gators try to follow 
up one of the best seasons in program history after losing seniors Sha Brooks and Marshae Dotson.

 Friday night, some of the top high school 
football players in the nation will gather un-
der the lights of one of college football’s most storied stadiums.This is UF’s ﬁ  fth annual Friday Night Lights 
camp, one of the biggest recruiting events in 
the country. The players, including many ver-
bal commitments for UF’s class of 2010, will get a taste of a college football atmosphere.
Matt Elam, a UF 2010 verbal commitment 
who will be attending FNL, told Rivals.com 
he heard rumors during his recruitment that Urban Meyer would not be in Gainesville after 
next season. 
Despite the rumors, the 
Gators’ next class already 
has 15 verbal commitments, and with many prospects 
from the class of 2011 ex-
pected to be in attendance Friday night, UF will not likely see much of a drop-off in the coming years.
“I assume they’re working on 2011 al-
ready,” said Jamie Newberg, a recruiting ana-
lyst for Rivals.com. “You look at how much that topic has been in the news, yet they’re still 
sitting on one of the top classes in the country 
on paper right now.” Recruits coming to Gainesville for Friday Night Lights

two national championships he won with UF 
in 2006 and 2008, something Mullen’s new players are acutely aware of. 
“He has what we want,” Wright said. “I 
believe that what coach Meyer has done, he’s going to do the same.”
Wright said he was upset to learn that pre-
vious coach Sylvester Croom would not be back for this season but became excited when he found out Mullen would be the new coach while watching SportsCenter on ESPN.
Though the defensive philosophy — run 
fast and hit hard, according to Wright — hasn’t changed, the offense is moving in a more dynam-ic direction. 
“I don’t like to get scored 
on in practice,” Wright said. “But it kind of made me 
happy to see that we are getting better.”The two programs are still on opposite 
ends of the SEC food chain, but MSU and UF will undoubtedly be linked for as long as Mul-len resides in Starkville. 
Wright said he would like to play for Mey-
er if he had to choose another coach within the 
SEC, and from the looks of things, he might 
find that playing for Mullen isn’t too far off. Defensive players see improvement in offense under Mullen’s spread
Brooks denied they were the one.
Petrino’s response: “I’m not crazy.”
The media contingent from Florida 
seems pretty determined to solve this 
whodunit, so the rest of the coaches will be asked the same thing.
 “I don’t know if y’all are going to 
find that culprit that didn’t vote for 
him, but you can tell [Tebow] it wasn’t 
me,” Johnson said.
Really, the only reason why a coach 
wouldn’t have voted for Tebow is to make a statement. Football is what these guys do, and they all know who 
the best quarterback in the conference is.
So here’s a breakdown of the re-
maining suspects, excluding Urban Meyer (coaches couldn’t vote for their own player):
Thursday
Nick Saban, Alabama — Maybe he’s 
still upset about losing the SEC title. Or 
maybe he really likes Mississippi’s Je-
van Snead. But as much as people hate 
Saban, I don’t see it. He’s high-profile 
and has shown Tebow plenty of love 
in the past, and he doesn’t really have anything to gain by doing it. And he’s 
a good evaluator of talent. And I don’t think he’s stupid.
Mark Richt, Georgia — Richt and 
Tebow are cut from the same cloth, and 
regardless of his hate for the Gators or 
Meyer’s timeout-calling, he isn’t the type to take that out on Tebow.
Houston Nutt, Ole Miss — Nutt 
was the early favorite since he has the conference’s second-best quarterback, but since he couldn’t vote for Snead, 
it probably wasn’t him. If it was, it 
means he voted for a third party and 
views Tebow as the conference’s third-
best quarterback. Nic Harris would be 
proud.
Friday
Gene Chizik, Auburn — Chizik 
played at UF, but he’s a new guy, and 
he’s fighting an uphill battle in trying to win over a fan base that just waved 
goodbye to Tommy Tuberville. For this reason, I’m taking Chizik as the dark 
horse to upset you-know-who. He’d 
be loved by Tigers fans for it, and he 
can deflect some criticism by saying he 
hasn’t coached against Tebow.
Steve Spurrier, South Carolina — 
No way, right?Les Miles, LSU — Miles recruited 
Tebow, and by all accounts, they got along well, so I don’t think it was him. I’d put him and Saban on the same level 
of likelihood.
Lane Kiffin, Tennessee — It’s almost 
like the SEC made the schedule with 
this in mind. Kiffin is going last, mean-
ing that by the time he takes the podi-um, it’s pretty likely that we’ll already 
have 10 denials in hand. Kiffin told The Associated Press he voted for Tebow, 
but I don’t want to count him out yet. I 
believe in his curmudgeonry. 
If everyone else says they voted for 
Tebow and Kiffin sticks to his story, it 
either means he voted for him and isn’t 
as crazy as we thought, or it means he didn’t, is lying and is calling an un-
named coach a liar. That is going to be 
fun. 
On the flip side, it helps his case that 
he denied it. If he voted for someone 
else, he’d most likely come out and say 
it, not keep it private.
Of course, this whole witch hunt is 
based on us assuming that these coach-es won’t do what most of them are very 
good at: lying in public. 
So we may never get an answer, but 
if that happens, Kiffin is probably going 
to take the blame.mike , from page 28
change the launch point, and you can set your 
quarterback at different spots, take some pres-sure off the offensive line and running backs,” Petrino said.
Mallett left Michigan when the Wolverines 
hired Rich Rodriguez, who brought his spread offense from West Virginia in 2008. 
“Ryan had always had a want and a love to go 
to the University of Arkansas. He has a lot of rel-atives in the state. So when he decided to transfer 
from Michigan, he says that the first phone call 
he made was to us,” Petrino said.Mallett left Michigan

 After making headlines all sea-
son en route to a national champi-
onship, UF was back in the news 
this off-season.
After cornerback Janoris Jenkins 
was arrested by Gainesville police 
in June and charged with misde-
meanor affray and resisting arrest without violence after an alleged ﬁ  ght outside of a nightclub — the 24th arrest of a UF football player 
in coach Urban Meyer’s four years 
— public outcry against Meyer and the Gators reached a new level.
That leads Gators fans to a se-
ries of related questions: Will the football team’s off-the-ﬁ  eld issues continue? Will they still be a big deal in the media?
In reality, UF’s troubles were 
not disproportionately greater than those of any other college football program over the last four years. Among its rivals, the 
number of arrests during that time 
span fell somewhere near the aver-age. Georgia players were arrested 30 times, Tennessee has totaled 21 arrests and FSU has tallied 13 ar-
rests.
Every major college football 
program struggles with off-the-
ﬁ  eld issues brought to light by the 
media and criticized by the public.
But success breeds contempt, 
and after a national title, a few 
off-season arrests made the Gators 
easy targets for the 
media, and Meyer’s 
control of his team was brought into question.
Six of the arrest-
ed players were not recruited by Meyer, and the number of charges by recruiting class over the last four years has decreased: eight 
(2005), eight (2006), two (2007), one 
(2008) and zero (2009).
Few of the arrests have been of 
a serious nature, and three of the 
arrests were from players who 
were already dismissed from the team at the time.
After the outcry against the 24 
arrests in four years, the eighth charge against a member of the 2006 class went by with little no-toriety. Rising senior linebacker Dustin Doe was cited for know-ingly driving with a suspended license last week.
The slow news cycle surround-
ing Jenkins’ arrest brought the story more coverage than that of Doe’s charge.Just as the Gators’ arrests by 
recruiting class has decreased year over year, the decrease in publicity  will likely continue as the college football season ramps up. THURSDAY, JULY 23, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 31

 PITTSBURGH — The Red Sox 
are hoping this latest trade for Pitts-
burgh’s leading power hitter turns out as well as last season’s.
The Red Sox acquired slump-
ing ﬁ  rst baseman Adam LaRoche on Wednesday for two midlevel 
prospects, less than a year after they 
picked up All-Star outﬁ  elder Jason Bay from the Pirates.
“I’m grateful for the opportunity 
that a team like that wants me,” said LaRoche, who is hitting .109 since July 4.Later in the day, Boston traded 
shortstop Julio Lugo to St. Louis for outﬁ  elder/ﬁ  rst baseman Chris Dun-
can and a player to be named later, SI.com has con-ﬁ  rmed. (The Car-
dinals also received cash consider-ations in the deal.) Lugo, in the third 
year of a four-year, $36 million deal, 
had fallen out of favor in Boston. The Red Sox designated him for as-signment last week. 
Duncan, hitting .227 with ﬁ  ve 
homers and 32 RBIs, had been op-tioned to Triple-A Memphis by the Cardinals before the deal was made.
The Pirates, who have traded 
ﬁ  ve starting position players since last July, will receive Double-A shortstop Argenis Diaz and Class-A right-hander Hunter Strickland, an 18th-round draft pick two years ago. Will off-the-field issues 
continue to be a problem?
