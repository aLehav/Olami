UF men and women lined up to strut 
their stuff Tuesday for the Homecoming 
Pageant’s 90th anniversary.
The judges chose six ﬁ  nalists for Home-
coming queen and king: Olivia Barket, Kacy Murphree, Abby Whiddon, Carlos Gordian, Daniel Landesberg and Jayce Victor. The winners will be announced at Gator Growl.
Finalists were chosen by their perfor-
mances in the casual wear and formal wear events, as well as by an interview with the judges prior to the pageant.
Josh Pittell, director of sponsorships 
for Gator Growl and a 20-year-old UF economics and sports management ju-nior, said the event has always signaled 
the beginning of Homecoming, and it’s a 
great experience to watch his friends walk across the stage.
“I’ve been coming to this pageant with 
my parents since I was a kid,” he said. “It puts all of our best students on the stage.”
Special awards included Miss Congeni-
ality and Miss Photogenic, given to Hillary Hall and Hannah Hong, respectively.
Amy Lunak, a 20-year-old UF public 
relations junior, said this is her ﬁ  rst year 
attending a pageant, and she said she felt 
all the contestants did a great job on stage.UF Homecoming ﬁ  nalists selected

Zachary Field knows better than to post 
an inappropriate photo on Facebook.Although the 21-year-old UF biology 
senior and medical school candidate thinks 
schools don’t have time to scroll through ap-
plicants’ Facebook pages, he plays it safe.
“Whether you’re a business major or 
you want to go to general school or medi-
cal school, to be in the professional world, it’s just kind of common sense now to keep your Facebook clean,” he said.A Kaplan survey of medical school ad-
missions ofﬁ  cers released last week found 32 percent of admissions ofﬁ  cers have used 
Google to learn more about an applicant. 
Additionally, 22 percent visited an appli-cant’s social networking sites, and of those, 42 percent found something that negatively impacted an applicant’s chances of accep-tance.Owen Farcy, director of MCAT 2015 
for Kaplan Test Prep, said medical schools haven’t embraced technology too much. 
Regardless, he said, students should know 
admissions ofﬁ  cers are paying attention.
UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd 
said the best rule of thumb is to ask if a picture or status is appropriate for a grand-mother’s eyes. Facebook needs to make grade for medical school applicantsSEAN STEWART-MUNIZ

Homecoming weekend will fall in Octo-
ber for 2014, the ﬁ  rst time it’s been sched-
uled outside of November in four years.
The Faculty Senate announced last week 
that the dates of the festivities will be Oct. 
17 and 18.
Bernard Mair, associate provost for un-
dergraduate affairs, said the choice to move 
Homecoming weekend to October is a long-
standing one. UF’s Faculty Senate made a 
request years ago that whenever possible, 
Homecoming would be held in October.
Mair said because November is rich in 
holidays, class schedules get broken up sig-
niﬁ  cantly, and professors are unable to teach 
their classes effectively.
“With holidays, students are always go-
ing home a day early, coming back a day 
late,” he said. “It really reduces the number 
of classes students attend, and November 
disappears quite quickly when three or four weeks have holidays.”
He said the reason Homecoming has been 
held in November for the past four years is 
that the SEC schedule didn’t provide enough 
home games during October. 
With the addition of the University of 
Missouri to the conference, the game sched-
ule has expanded enough to allow for the 
shift.
Students have voiced dissatisfaction with Homecoming 
2014 not four-
day weekend

A Gainesville woman was arrested Mon-
day night after police say she incited a rowdy 
crowd and threatened an ofﬁ  cer.
Shantel Uranious Johnson was arrested 
Monday at about 7:30 p.m. on charges of a city ordinance violation/disorderly conduct
Ofﬁ  cers responded to ﬁ  nd a group of about 
100 people ﬁ  ghting at 1727 NE Eighth Ave., according to a GPD arrest report.
As ofﬁ  cers tried to break up the crowd, 
one advised Johnson to move along, accord-ing to the report. She walked forward, turned 
around and said, “I am moving.”
When the ofﬁ  cer told her to leave, accord-
ing to the report, Johnson suddenly raised her 
hand, pushed it about one inch from the of-
ﬁ  cer’s face and said, “F*** you!”
The crowd was agitated and unruly, ac-
cording to the report, and Johnson’s actions attracted a group of people to stand defen-sively around the ofﬁ  cer.
As of press time, she had been released.
…
At about 3 a.m. Tuesday, a UPD ofﬁ  cer 
went to Thomas Hall on the UF campus in 
response to a tip that three men seemed like 
they might steal a bike.
The ofﬁ  cer saw the men, asked them to 
come talk to him, and they agreed, according 
to an arrest report. The ofﬁ  cer interviewed 
them individually.
One of them, 38-year-old Joseph Cleutus 
Henstler, said he was on campus with the 
intention of stealing a bike. Arron Jewell, 20, also said he meant to steal a bike on campus, 
according to the report.
James Kennett, 20, the third man, said he 
found a bike and took it, but then he changed 
his mind and put it in the bushes, according 
to the report.
All three were arrested on charges of loiter-
ing and prowling. As of press time, they had 
been released.Roundup: Gainesville Police

She had tried and failed before, 
but this year, Elizabeth Renda’s 
hard work proved successful when her name was printed on the list of White House interns for Fall 2013.
Renda, a UF public relations se-
nior from McLean, Va., said she has aspired her entire college career to 
be chosen for the program.
She, along with Makda Matthew, 
from Clermont, Fla., were the only 
two UF students chosen for the in-ternship. As of press time, Matthew couldn’t be reached for comment.Renda and the other interns have 
been in Washington since Septem-ber. However, the list was publicly released last week.
The internship offers students 
the chance to work in several de-partments of the White House, in-cluding the Office of the First Lady, Office of the Vice President and the 
Office of Cabinet Affairs.
Renda, who was selected to work 
in the White House Office of Public 
Engagement and Intergovernmen-tal Affairs, said she works with the liaison to veterans and coordinates White House tours for the Wounded Warriors Project.
“No two days in my office are 
very similar, and day-to-day tasks vary dramatically,” she said in an email. “The office environment is extremely fast-paced.”
Renda said her time at UF was 
key in helping her attain the intern-ship.
“As a public relations major … I 
have learned so much about effec-tive communication and stakehold-er outreach, which are crucial skills to my position here at the White House,” she said.
Ana Barrenechea, the director for building alliances for the UF Alumni Association, said when Renda was an intern for her department, she al-ready had her sights set on D.C.
Ron Pierce, the director of Demo-
cratic National Committee Constitu-ency Department in Washington, D.C., said Renda was the best choice for the internship. As a 2011 sum-mer intern for Pierce, Renda worked to help organize veterans during the Obama re-election campaign.
“Her getting the internship is not 
surprising,” he said.
The opportunity will not only 
benefit Renda when she returns to UF but also after she graduates in Summer 2014, she said.
“In the past two months alone, I 
have learned more than I ever imag-ined possible,” she said. “It is a sur-real dream to walk into work every day at the White House led by the president who I’ve worked hard to support.”

Ripples of remembrance have 
reached Gainesville after the death 
of Lou Reed, leader of rock ’n’ roll cornerstone the Velvet Under-
ground.
Reed died in his home on Sun-
day at the age of 71 due to lingering 
complications from a recent liver transplant, according to his literary agent.
Daniel Halal, the 29-year-old 
owner of Gainesville-based Arrow’s Aim Records, said Reed leaves a lasting imprint on musical genres.
“The Velvet Underground is 
hands down the major influence on all modern punk and rock,” he said.
The intellectual art-rock move-
ment, which Reed was a large part of under the wing of Andy Warhol, brought into light controversial so-cietal issues by addressing them in the music, said David Carlson, ex-ecutive director at the UF Center for Media Innovation and Research.
Carlson, who teaches the Rock ‘n’ 
Roll and American Society course at UF, said Reed became an important and controversial public figure with his bare-bones style of guitar.
Writing a song like “Heroin” — 
which includes drug references such as “When I put a spike into my vein, then I tell you things aren’t quite the same” — in the 1960s was undoubt-edly shocking for the public, Carl-son said.
“He became this overall aesthetic 
event where the performance and the mood showed as much as the lyrics,” said Jason Cain, a former 
musician who also teaches the rock 
‘n’ roll class.
The visceral 
sound Reed pio-neered influenced bands like The Doors, Patti Smith 
and the Talking 
Heads. He was a root for a whole generation of mu-
sic, Cain said. Reed’s album “Trans-former,” which he produced with David Bowie in 1972, was one of the key albums that launched him into the public eye.
Due to their popularity, Reed’s 
well-known records generally sell out quickly at Arrow’s Aim. But now, Halal said, he expects Reed’s lesser-known work to leave shelves quickly, too.
“Now, I expect all of them to sell 
out even faster,” Halal said.
Lou Reed also indirectly shaped 
other bands that younger genera-tions are more likely to be familiar with. For example, Third Eye Blind’s “Semi-Charmed Life” was writ-ten as a response and tribute to the “Walk on the Wild Side” single that boosted Reed to fame.
Daft Punk’s paid tribute to Reed  
by incorporating his motorcycle hel-met from “Legendary Hearts” in the cover art of its newest album.
“Even if you didn’t like the 
Velvet Underground, chances are someone you like liked them a lot,” Cain said.Gainesvillians feel loss

Some students take brief vacations over Homecoming weekend
Homecoming’s November dates for a while now, he said. 
Veterans Day coincided with Homecoming in 2012 and 
2013, adding an extra day to the already three-day-long 
weekend. 
Taking advantage of the extra time, some students 
chose to put Gainesville in their rear-view mirrors instead of sticking around for the festivities. Next weekend, for example, many Gators are planning to skip Growl to at-tend the Electric Daisy Carnival in Orlando.
Uncontested by the holiday, Homecoming events in 
2014 could see greater student attendance.
Megan Harmon, producer for 2013’s Gator Growl, 
wrote in an email the event’s date is chosen by the Faculty Senate, and the Growl team works around it.
Harmon said, to her knowledge, the month Homecom-
ing is hosted in doesn’t have an effect on attendance by students or nonstudents.Carlos Mijares, a 20-year-old UF environmental engi-
neering transfer student, said he’s much more likely to go to Homecoming if it’s held in October.
He said he travels home the most in November because 
so many holidays are spread throughout the month.
“When there’s a choice between Homecoming and a 
four-day weekend at home, I’m pretty sure I’d rather go home,” Mijares said. “I have school spirit, but I’d rath-er spend Veterans Day weekend with my family and friends.”DATE , from page 1LIFESTYLE

With mixed feelings among college students 
about the updated iPhone operating system, some 
UF students are now turning to the BlackBerry Messenger app as an alternative.
Blackberry released BBM in the App Store and 
Google Play last week. In the first 24 hours, BBM was downloaded more than 10 million times, ac-cording to a news release.
“I guess people want to revive something dead 
or do something new,” said Amanda Camejo, an 18-year-old journalism freshman.
Camejo has a BlackBerry and said the app is 
more popular with iPhone users than with the BlackBerry users she knows.
“It’s just another way for people with iPhones to 
communicate with other people with iPhones,” she said. “People are always looking for the new social 
media or the new way to communicate.”
Vicki DeJaco, a 20-year-old UF psychology ju-
nior, said she downloaded the new app because 
she remembered it from “back when BlackBerries were popular.”
DeJaco, who has an iPhone, said she likes the 
app because she finds it easier to send media, and she likes to see when her messages have been read.
But she said she doesn’t know many other peo-
ple who have the app.

� THE IRANIAN STUDENT 
ASSOCIATION AND PhD MOMS RECEIVED FUNDING. 
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writercwright@alligator.org
Within 13 minutes, Tuesday 
night’s Student Senate approved 
funding for two organizations and wrapped up its weekly meet-ing.
After the chambers were tem-
porarily relocated to HOL 285B, one ﬂ  oor above the usual location in the Chesterﬁ  eld Smith Class-room in the Levin College of Law,  about 75 senators were present.
Senators moved to unani-
mously approve funding for the Iranian Student Association and 
PhD Moms, as well as strike the 
ﬁ  nance code revisions from the agenda.
The revisions, which proposed 
changes to student organizations’ uses of outside bank accounts, 
were struck because budget and 
appropriations chair Sen. Joseph Michaels and Student Body Trea-surer Jayce Victor, the bill’s au-thors, were unable to present the bill.
After the meeting, Michaels 
said he and Victor wanted to be there for the bill presentation to 
ensure the revisions were as clear 
as possible.
The Iranian Student Associa-
tion was granted $578 in funding, and PhD Moms received $1,163. A few announcements were made, and senators let out a sigh of relief when it was decided to email committee reports.
Sen. Matt Pesek believed 
many senators were in a mid-semester jam.
“Senators are students, too, 
so in addition to serving the students, they have to deal with midterms like everyone else,” he said.Senators meet brieﬂ  y,

Machen misses point
“You better keep walking, girl, because we’re gonna grab 
you if we catch you.”
“Damn, baby, I want to put you in a cage!”
“You look like a f***ing cow.”These are malicious phrases men have actually yelled at 
female Alligator staffers as they walked near UF’s campus. Catcalling is unfortunately an inevitable experience in the lives of college women, but rarely does it catch the attention of a university’s president — or police, for that matter.
The Alligator ran a Page 1 story Tuesday about UF Presi-
dent Bernie Machen’s email to the Greek community re-
garding an incident in which an Alpha Tau Omega brother 
shouted racial and sexist slurs at a black, female UF student as she walked by the fraternity house. It’s no secret UF has a race problem — last Fall, an Instagram picture of two stu-dents dressed in blackface makeup went viral and prompted national criticism — and Machen has proved ineffective in 
addressing it. His email to the Student Body following the 
blackface scandal came about two weeks after the Oct. 24 event, and he did not show up to a town hall meeting called to discuss the controversy.
So why, then, does the account of an anonymous individ-
ual who was catcalled at — and who never ﬁ  led an ofﬁ  cial 
complaint — warrant the president’s intervention?
Machen has completely mishandled this case.
In his personal letter sent to the Greek Listserv, he target-
ed a single group of students, made blanket statements and 
revealed only hazy details about what happened. 
Why would Machen attach his name to one letter sent to 
one organization instead of putting his energies behind a 
broader effort to stop catcalling in general?
Here are the facts: UF women are catcalled at daily. It may 
seem harmless to the guys shouting from their trucks, but it’s traumatic for women who don’t know whether the men will 
keep driving or pull over and assault them. It’s a big prob-
lem, and it needs a big solution — not a passive email.
Machen could have used this opportunity to educate 
the entire university community about making women and 
people of all races feel safe. Rather than saying how “disap-
pointed and ashamed” he felt, he could have taken real action 
— something more than a mandatory diversity workshop, 
which has proven to be ineffective in the past.
As an editorial board, we ask: What were Machen’s mo-
tives for acting on this speciﬁ  c student’s behalf, and what does he plan to do to combat racial and sexual harassment 
overall at UF?
By only addressing one group of students, Machen mini-
mized an overarching issue. Catcalling is not something that 
happened to one UF student one time because of one moronic 
frat guy.
But that’s the message he sent.

Georgia Line in concert at UF?Today’s question: Has someone ever catcalled at you?Don’t blame Student Body for corruption
Here’s a story with a strange ending: There was 
once a student at UF who became involved with campus politics. As the liaison between the ma-
jority party and the fraternities, she sent an email ensur-ing the frat boys don’t forget to lend their support.
But endorsements wouldn’t be enough: She remind-
ed the 25 fraternity representatives to collect “I Voted” 
stickers from everyone and provide the governing 
party with $250 checks. Her message ended with, “DE-LETE THIS AFTER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ON RECORD! Sketchy, but do it!”
The “enforcer” now has a gig on the Rules and Ethics 
Committee as a senator in Student Government.
I mention this to take some heat off the Accent Speak-
er’s Bureau, which was unhappy with my highlighting 
of the bureau’s nepotism last week. After openly admit-
ting the Student Government has some cronyism, also known as legacy positions, an Accent representative said in a letter to the editor, “I blame the Student Body more than I blame the University of Florida Greek sys-
tem.”
The year I came to campus, members of the SG ma-
jority party met with Greek ofﬁ  cials for a quick black-
mailing session during elections. In attendance was the 
then-Student Body president.
In a recording of the meeting, sororities are heard 
threatening to punish its members if they don’t vote 
by depriving them of food and promising alcohol to those who conformed. A student, allegedly a senator, 
applauded the Maﬁ  a tactics, saying, “That’s amazing, 
that’s what you need to do.... Not too many sororities do that, that’s awesome.”
This criminal behavior isn’t new. Former Florida 
Gov. Bob Graham said during his years at UF, there was a strong “emphasis on clandestine activities,” with phones being bugged and newspapers being stolen if the Alligator endorsed the “wrong” student party.
And then, there is the noto-
rious, yet highly effective, code of silence.
When a UF sorority member 
summoned up her courage last 
year to post a Facebook status 
about Student Government — 
“It’s patronage politics, and that’s what I hate so much about it. It’s not democratic at all.” — she was rebuked in the most Orwellian terms: Her opinions were deemed 
“unsisterly and inappropriate.” The backlash from the 
Greek system reminded others to keep their mouths shut.
Anyone who speaks up is fair game — even the Al-
ligator. After it reported in 2012 of Will Muschamp’s en-dorsement of an opposition candidate, the then-Student Senate president pro tempore confessed to dumping hundreds of Alligator copies into the garbage.
The newspaper’s president emeritus wrote in 2011 
that some UF administration members and “various stu-dent ‘leadership’ organizations drastically cut advertis-ing dollars spent in the Alligator” over the years, giving an impression that there was a “continuing attempt ... to 
suppress the voice of the Alligator.” This semester, the 
editorial board did not fully endorse either party.
Those already in power will continue to shield them-
selves, telling us to stop whining and get involved. These empty words mean little to UF students who are 
well-aware that the SG system is inherently undemo-
cratic. 
The administration should tackle this plague of cor-
ruption if it’s serious about making UF a top 10 public 
school.

opinions@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
It is no secret that 
the high levels of proﬁ  tability 
among many large American corpora-
tions stem, in part, 
from their low labor costs. According to Reuters, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is “one of the lowest minimum wages” among industrialized countries.  
One of the sectors of Ameri-
can business that beneﬁ  ts most from the low minimum wage is the food-service industry. As of 2012, about half of all workers employed at or below minimum wage levels worked in the hospi-tality industry, particularly in res-taurants and other food services.
The wages these workers earn 
are simply not enough to ensure they and their families have a place to live, enough food on the table, affordable health insurance and other basic necessities. 
As a result, many of these 
workers rely on government as-sistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition As-
sistance Program — SNAP, also 
known as food stamps — to make ends meet.
There is abundant evidence 
the large corporations that pay these minimum wages are well aware their employees are strug-gling to survive. Labor activists recently recorded a phone call 
between a McDonald’s employee 
earning minimum wage and a representative of “McResources,” the company’s human resources division.
The McResources staffer in-
structed the minimum wage worker on how to apply for vari-ous forms of public assistance, in-
cluding SNAP and Medicaid, the 
state-based, government-funded health insurance program for the poor.
In effect, this McResources 
worker was acknowledging that the immense proﬁ  tability of Mc-Donald’s and other corporations depends in part on subsidies 
provided to its minimum-wage 
workers by the federal govern-ment. 
McDonald’s does not pay 
its workers enough for them to make ends meet, so the govern-ment must step in and make up the difference.
McDonald’s is not the only 
company that relies on federal as-sistance to help keep its employ-ees out of abject poverty. Accord-ing to some estimates, as much as 80 percent of Wal-Mart’s employ-ees receive food stamps.
This corporate subsidy allows 
large corporations to get away with paying their workers much 
less than they need to survive. This system also un-
dermines our free-market economy by forcing the govern-ment to ﬁ  ll the gap 
between the wages 
corporations pay and the salaries their workers require.
Until 2012, Mc-
Donald’s was a corporate mem-ber of the American Legislative Exchange Council. ALEC is an organization composed of state 
and federal legislators, corporate 
lobbyists and other inﬂ  uential ﬁ  g-ures of politics and business. The group advocates for conservative and pro-business legislation at all levels of government, including legislation that would repeal or scale back minimum wage laws across the United States. ALEC 
has also supported measures that 
would eviscerate various parts of the already-fraying American social safety net, including Med-icaid and SNAP.  
McDonald’s ended its ALEC 
membership in 2012 as a result of pressure from progressive ad-vocacy group Color of Change 
and extensive media coverage of 
the company’s relationship with ALEC. However, ALEC contin-ues to enjoy the support of doz-ens of other large corporations, including AT&T, Pﬁ  zer and Shell Oil Company.
Business lobbying groups like 
ALEC and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce almost universally 
oppose increasing the minimum wage. They argue a higher mini-mum wage would put an undue burden on both small and large businesses. 
However, the minimum-wage 
workforce is almost entirely employed by large, extremely 
wealthy corporations like Mc-
Donald’s and Wal-Mart.  These companies can undoubtedly af-ford to pay their minimum wage workers a few more dollars per hour and still maintain a high level of proﬁ  tability.
McDonald’s and other large 
corporations should pay their 
employees wages that ensure 
all their workers are able to lead healthy and comfortable lives without relying on the support of the federal government. Op-posing increases in the minimum wage while relying on the federal government to make up the dif-ference is both hypocritical and 
harmful to millions of working 
Americans. The social safety net should be designed to assist those unable to provide for themselves, not as a means for large corpora-tions to increase their proﬁ  ts.

opinions@alligator.orgNow that the government 
shutdown has ended, it’s time to focus on what we 
informed citizens can do to further our government’s stellar ﬁ  nancial 
standing and its excellent track re-
cord of international diplomacy.
Let’s ﬁ  rst acknowledge our 
primary role in government’s im-pressive strides since the Vietnam War. We’ve consistently held our elected ofﬁ  cials accountable. And why wouldn’t we? It takes a ma-jority of our well-informed, for-
ward-thinking population to elect 
statesmen, and unlike those of this country’s early days, today’s elected ofﬁ  cials are principled, deep-thinking and slow to make rash decisions. Unlike our forefa-thers, the politicians of 2013 live outside the Beltway bubble and are in tune with citizens’ needs.
Now that we’ve gotten our-
selves going in the right direc-tion, let’s continue the tradition of reaching near-maximum voter turnout in midterm elections. That’s how we can reward our in-touch government. 
Next, let’s do what’s right for 
the economy. “How do we do that?” you ask. We have to help 
those well-run, beloved busi-
nesses that form the backbone of our economy: mega-corporations and the federal government. If you work for a small business, now would be a good time to quit  and head to Wal-Mart to get a high-paying job at a company that cares. Big businesses pay 
more, care more about individual 
employees and do more for local economies than small businesses. In fact, because small businesses tend to use overseas tax havens, they actually hurt our economy — despite what their expensive na-tional-TV-commercial campaigns tell you. We should also add to 
our nation’s running surplus by 
paying more taxes. If mega-corps can bear the burden of high taxa-tion, why can’t we? Middle-class folks receive the most government welfare while U.S.-based corpora-tions are forced to trim fat and cut CEO pay just to break even. Let’s 
stop being lazy and do what’s 
best for America. Let’s go out and work two or three more jobs. It’ll make us happier. Trust me. How do you think Ivy League-educat-ed execs running big businesses got their positions? Let’s stop ask-ing for handouts and do what de-fense contractors, the auto indus-
try and major banking institutions 
have done for decades: Suck it up and work through the hard times. That’s what’ll makes us great, not bailing us out every time we hit a rough patch.
This list isn’t quite exhaustive, 
but these simple suggestions can keep our country on the ﬁ  rst-place 
podium it has held for its entire 
existence. Let’s go, America. We can do this!

Recently in Florida, 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick committed suicide after repeated and re-
lentless bullying from two girls, ages 12 and 14. Sheriff Grady Judd, how-
ever, decided enough was enough — especially 
in light of the fact that the older girl continued to post abusive remarks about Rebecca after her death — and now was the time to take better ac-tion against those involved in bullying-suicide cases.  
Both girls who relentlessly bullied Sedwick 
are facing felony charges, including harassment.In the age of social media and the Internet, it is becoming increasingly easier to bully individu-als without leaving a trace — meaning you can completely ignore your vic-tim throughout the day at school, then bombard them with hate once both of you are at home on Facebook, Twit-
ter or Snapchat. In the end, bullying is a grow-ing and evolving monster that must be stopped. While many states endorse strict policies to ad-dress bullying, it often may not be enough.  
For the future, it may not be enough just to 
punish the bully but to move toward holding all parties accountable, starting with the parents.

A performer some call the West 
Coast’s hottest new artist is set to head-
line at a charity ball on Thursday.
DJ Audrey Napoleon will be art-
ist of the night at the fourth annual 
Vampires’ Ball hosted by the Pledge 5 
Foundation. The ball, which includes a haunted house entrance, will be held from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday at Level Nightclub, 238 W. University Ave.
“Her whole personality and style 
fits Halloween,” said Jason Bowman, a Pledge 5 spokesman. “She’s edgy, and we’re not afraid of 
edge.”
In the last three 
years, Napoleon has garnered world-wide recognition and opened for acts 
like The Cure and 
deadmau5, Bowman said.
The event is a mash-up of several 
philanthropic causes. Students can at-tend for free if they contribute a few ounces of blood.
Students can donate at a LifeSouth 
bus that will be in front of the club from 6 to 9 p.m. From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., blood donations can also be given at Honda of Gainesville, 3801 N. Main St. In exchange, students will be granted free admission to the ball.
For those unable to donate, dis-
counted tickets are available for pur-
chase online at pledge5.org or $20 at 
the door.
Alicia Leva, a 20-year-old UF inter-
national studies junior and an Alpha Phi Omega officer, said some of the funds raised by the haunted house will benefit Nicaraguan children.
“We’re helping locally and globally, 
at the same time,” she said.Audrey Napoleon to head Vampires’ Ball
� SQUATS, LEG PRESSES AND DEAD-LIFTS ARE 
FORMS OF STRENGTH TRAINING. 
CHRISTINE FLAMMIA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Spandex? Check. Cleats? Check. Frisbee shorts? 
Check.
After suiting up in uniform, Melissa Roberts and her 
teammates follow a light jog with a series of moving 
stretches before launching into ultimate Frisbee practice.
Roberts, a 20-year-old UF health science junior, uses 
stretching to ward off possible injuries during practice.
But a new study from the British Journal of Sports 
Medicine showed that strength training, not stretching, is the best way for athletes to prevent injury.
Patricia M. Tripp, UF clinical associate professor and 
director of the CAATE Undergraduate Athletic Training Program, said squat, leg press and dead-lift exercises are all forms of strength training. She said there isn’t a lot of 
evidence to show stretching before physical activity will 
prevent an injury.
Dynamic warm-ups are the best prevention, she said. 
A dynamic warm-up is any type of activity that gets blood flowing such as riding a bike.
“You don’t want the muscles to be cold,” she said.Barbara Smith, UF physical therapy research assistant 
professor, agreed there is a lack of evidence that stretch-ing before a workout prevents injury. There is evidence 
that strength training can.
However, stretching is the focus for certain athletics 
such as gymnastics or dance, she said. In these sports, the 
athlete needs a high level of flexibility. 
“If I were to pluck 10 people off the street, I’d probably 
be concerned with strength training,” she said.
In general, she said, staying active and staying strong 
are important ways to prevent injury.
Although the study focused on pre-workout warm-
ups, Tripp said the key is what people do post-work-out. A lot of people don’t realize the importance of the cooldown and post-activity stretching, she said. Cooling down means lowering the heart rate. This could include walking after running or slowing down after cycling quickly, Tripp said.
“If something is painful, your body is telling you 
something,” she said. “Address what that is.”
As for a go-to solution to prevent injury, she said it is 
individual-specific.Strength training

The university’s library system was recent-
ly chosen to preserve the papers of a legacy.
Stetson Kennedy, a writer, activist and ad-
vocate for social justice who passed away in 
2011, will now have his 70 years of material on 
display in the George A. Smathers Libraries 
Special Collections.
The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program 
held a commemoration last week that cel-ebrated the importance of having Kennedy’s life research and papers together and available to students and researchers.
“I think it’s fitting that his papers wound 
up in a library named in honor of his nemesis, Florida Sen. George Smathers,” UF First Lady 
Chris Machen said.
Paul Ortiz, the director of the oral history 
program, said Kennedy wanted his papers to 
go somewhere they would be well-preserved, promoted and treasured.
“This is a great day in the history of the 
University of Florida. This is a wonderful day for the people of our state. It’s an exceptional day in the history of our nation,” he said.
Kennedy’s collection of never-before-seen records covers many of the most important social movements and struggles for justice in the history of 
our nation, Ortiz said.
“Part of the reason the 
Stetson papers are coming 
here is that we have the best 
library staff and faculty in the nation,” Ortiz said. “We 
have tremendous reading room and tremen-dous bibliographers.”
The collection consists of poems, his ac-
counts of lynchings and Ku Klux Klan activi-ties, and other harsh realities of life, First Lady Machen said.
“[Kennedy’s papers] are an astonishing 
collection of the various paraphernalia of the 
KKK, including all their secret signals, bylaws 
and propaganda gathered as part of Stetson’s decade-long crusade against the clan,” she said.
Kennedy’s wife, Sandra Parks, said she 
hoped Kennedy’s legacy would quicken the in-terest in maintaining the ecosystem of Florida, encourage curiosity about traditions of other cultures, and encourage them to think about current human and civil rights violations.Smathers acquires writings about topics like lynching, KKK
� THE LEFT LANDING GEAR DEPLOYED TOO LATE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAPE CANAVERAL — A new, smaller version of NASA’s 
space shuttle is recuperating from a rough first landing.
The Dream Chaser space plane is being designed by Si-
erra Nevada Corp. It’s vying to carry astronauts to and from 
the International Space Station in four or five more years.The Nevada-based company tested a full-scale model at 
Edwards Air Force Base in California on Saturday. A heli-copter dropped the unmanned craft from 12,500 feet in a first free flight reminiscent of NASA’s drop tests of the shuttle 
prototype Enterprise in the 1970s.
Everything worked well for the automated Dream Chaser 
model until the end, when the left landing gear deployed too 
late and the test vehicle skidded off the runway.
Company space systems chief Mark Sirangelo said Tues-
day that damage was minor. The left gear was still attached, and the tire wasn’t even 
shredded, he said. The crew cabin area was unscathed — astronauts would have been uninjured, he said. The flight computers never stopped working, and nothing critical was 
damaged.
Sirangelo stressed that the minute-long test flight was a 
success despite the ending.
He said the mishap is likely due to mechanical failure. 
Sierra Nevada plans the first orbital flight demo of Dream 
Chaser in 2016 and the first crewed orbital mission in 2017.Mini space shuttle skids off runway in test flight in CaliforniaKennedy

Gators ﬁ  nish fall season
The Florida men’s and women’s golf teams ﬁ  nished 
their fall seasons Tuesday. Read the story online at 
alligatorSports.org.Florida sophomore tight end Kent Taylor will likely redshirt this season. Read the story on page 14.Muschamp 
needs ﬁ  rst win 
against UGA
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
For center Damontre Harris, conditioning has been an up-
hill battle. 
After missing the majority of practice during his redshirt 
season last year with an array of injuries, Harris, a South 
Carolina transfer, made it only a few days in practice before 
straining his hamstring. 
The injury proved to be minor, as Harris returned to prac-
tice earlier last week after sitting out about a week. But coach 
Billy Donovan said the 6-foot-10 center has since looked “re-ally out of shape.”“Got a long way to go,” Donovan said. 
“The unfortunate part was him being plagued with his shoulder, his ankle, even 
the illness he had to deal with. He’s missed 
a lot of conditioning and a lot of practice.”
Since the beginning of the 2012-13 sea-
son, Harris has dealt with several setbacks. 
In October of 2012, he suffered a torn labrum that required surgery and forced him to miss about four months of action. 
Also during his redshirt year, he battled a sprained ankle 
and strep throat. Doctors found a blood clot in his throat, which Harris said he treated with a multitude of medicines. 
During his sophomore season at South Carolina in 2011-
12, Harris averaged 2.3 blocks per game — tied for second 
most in the Southeastern Conference behind Kentucky’s An-
thony Davis. Although he succeeded as a rim protector while at USC, Harris had a small role on offense as a starter, averag-ing 6.8 points in 25.9 minutes per game.
But when he practiced during summer workouts, Harris 
saw himself improve as a scorer.
“I think my offense got a lot better compared to when I 
was at South Carolina,” Harris said during UF’s media day.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
A big change is coming to the Gators, 
and it is coming in a big package.
With starting right tackle Tyler Moore 
struggling against Southeastern Confer-
ence pass rushes, junior Trenton Brown will likely get his ﬁ  rst career start when Florida plays Georgia on Saturday in Jacksonville.
“He’s in line to play quite a bit,” of-
fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. 
Brown stood out from the other line-men during fall camp due to his size, but he had trouble blocking quick defenders 
like Dante Fowler Jr. and Ronald Pow-
ell. Despite Brown’s struggles, Pease 
said practicing against top-notch play-ers made the JUCO transfer a better line-man.
“What I’ve found out is every day 
you’re going against great guys in what we have in Dante and (Jon) Bullard and the guys we see on the edge,” Pease said. “So you get good practice reps, and 
you’ve got to … have intensity.”Rivals.com rated Brown a three-star 
prospect, but his experience on the line quickly vaulted him up the depth chart. 
He was listed as the backup right tackle 
for each game this season.
While Brown took second-team reps, 
the offensive line struggled. Quarterback 
Tyler Murphy has been sacked 10 times 
in the past two games, including six 
times by Mizzou defenders in Florida’s last game.

Harris working to improve conditioning prior to start of seasonSaturday’s game against Georgia is a 
must-win for Will Muschamp and Florida.
I’m not just talk-
ing in terms of this 
year. I’m talking 
about the long haul.
The Gators are 
still in contention to earn a spot in the Southeastern Con-ference Champion-ship Game, but they would need help even if they manage to win out.
But there’s more than that at stake on 
Saturday.
Regardless of how this season turns out, 
Muschamp needs to get over the Bulldog hump.
If Georgia beats Florida for the third 
straight time at EverBank Field, it spells trouble for the Muschamp Era at Florida.
From the moment Muschamp took over 
for Urban Meyer in January 2011, Georgia has been in his head. The former Bulldogs safety has promised a victory in this game a couple of times at Gator Club meetings.
“I certainly can,” Muschamp said in 2011 
to an Atlanta Gator Club member and bride-to-be who asked him to guarantee a victory against the Bulldogs on her wedding day.
Two losses later, he again stirred up the 
Georgia talk at a Jacksonville Gator Club meeting in May, promising a win against the ‘Dawgs.
“Well, it’s not going to be a long winning 
streak, I can assure you,” Muschamp said of Georgia’s two straight victories against Florida. “We feel very comfortable.”
If you’re going to play to the crowd at 
these things, you’ve got to back it up.

The lasting image from Jordan 
Reed’s college career might be his fum-
ble in the fourth quarter against Geor-gia last season.
But his value to the team is even 
more apparent after watching the 
struggles of Florida’s current crop of tight ends.
 Offensive coordinator Brent Pease 
said Tuesday that sophomore Kent 
Taylor will likely redshirt this year — a 
disappointing end to the season for a player the Gators once counted on to replace Reed’s production. 
“You got to be able to block in that 
position and run routes,” Pease said. “You got to see that you can perform and your performance has got to show up, but I don’t know if his develop-
ment is totally there, and not every kid 
is going to be an immediate guy.”
Taylor came into the season as 
Reed’s heir apparent after the redshirt junior played his last game in a Gators uniform. 
Following Florida’s loss to Louis-
ville in the Sugar Bowl, he and Reed shared a long embrace in the locker 
room. 
It looked like the torch was passed, 
but that succession has failed to mate-
rialize.
An offseason ankle injury kept Tay-
lor on the sidelines early. A need for better blocking along the offensive line doomed any chance for the tight end from Land O’Lakes to see the ﬁ  eld.
“He’s a kid that’s got to maintain 
weight to play in that position,” Pease said. “He can’t be too light, and some-
times I think in this sport, and at this 
level, you’ve got to give kids a chance to develop.”
Muschamp winless in series: As a former Georgia safety, coach Will Muschamp is no stranger to the an-nual Jacksonville slugfest between the Gators and the Bulldogs. It has been 19 years since he played his last Florida-Georgia game, but he has still not come out on top. 
Georgia has won the last two match-
ups. Do not ask the third-year coach if this game means more to him. It is big-ger than that.“Not for me, (but) for our players 
and for the Gator Nation, absolutely,” Muschamp said Monday. 
“I hate to give you the boring an-
swer, but I don’t approach this one any different than the other ones. It’s a criti-cal game for us, obviously being a great 
rival with the University of Florida and 
a great rivalry game. It’s one of the best college football games, year in, year out, to be a part of.”

Before Florida and Georgia square off on the 
football ﬁ  eld on Saturday in Jacksonville, the two 
programs’ swimming teams will compete in the pool Friday. 
The Bulldogs’ women’s team, the defending 
NCAA and Southeastern Conference champions, poses a threat and can give the Gators their ﬁ  rst two-meet losing streak since Florida lost to Texas A&M and Florida State last November.
UF came up short 
against California on Oct. 20, and considering Geor-gia has dominated Flori-
da’s women in the water in recent history — the 
Gators’ last win against the Bulldogs was in Octo-
ber  2006 — Friday’s meet may be a grudge match seven years in the making. 
“We feel like, if nothing else, we’d like to get 
the weekend started on a good foot,” coach Gregg Troy said. “In our sport, it’s not quite as dramatic whether you win or lose this point in the year. It’s a little bit more of a measuring stick.”
It may be Florida that will be used as the mea-
suring stick Friday. The Bulldogs’ women are 4-0 but have faced only one opponent in the top 20 this season, defeating No. 20 Wisconsin on Oct. 4-5. 
Troy said he thinks Georgia is just getting 
warmed up.
“They’ve got no weaknesses, and they’ve got 
someone every place,” he said. “They’re deep and they’re strong everywhere. It’s going to be a heads-up competition.”
The Bulldogs men’s team provides another 
threat, having posted two top times in the country this season. Georgia is also second to Florida in the 800-yard freestyle relay — the Gators’ best relay.
“It gives us a chance to measure where we’re at 
and what athletes we have and what they’re going to have to do at the end of the year,” Troy said.Gators looking to

Offensive coordinator Brent Pease watches warm-up drills prior to Florida’s 
36-17 loss to Missouri on Oct. 19 at Faurot Field in Columbia, Mo.

UF offensive coordinatoragainst LSU but played through 
the injury against Missouri. He sat out the last week of prac-tice so he could rest the injured 
shoulder and is expected to start 
against Georgia (4-3, 3-2 SEC).
Murphy will not last long if 
his offensive line cannot protect him.
Coach Will Muschamp and 
his staff have spent the past 
week trying to sort out who 
will play on the line. Pease said on Tuesday that they have nar-
rowed it down to “eight to nine 
guys.”
Florida (4-3, 3-2 SEC) hopes 
Brown can ease their woes at 
tackle, as both Moore and soph-
omore D.J. Humphries have 
struggled to stack up against 
SEC defensive ends. 
Humphries was picked on 
twice for sacks to end UF’s last offensive drive against LSU, and 
Moore surrendered multiple 
sacks when he lined up against Missouri’s Michael Sam.
“We had too many negative 
plays,” Pease said. “It’s hard for 
them. It’s hard because they get 
matchups. 
“You’ve got to do a good 
job of winning against the very 
good players, and you’re not going to win them all. So it’s 
just kind of the consistency of playing against, playing with a very good opponent in that po-
sition.”
The Gators have tried another 
transfer, lineman Max Garcia, at 
tackle but have received mixed results. Garcia has primarily 
played left guard at Florida.
“(I’m) not as comfortable as 
I am at left guard,” Garcia said 
of playing at tackle. “I have practiced left guard since the 
spring.”
Pease said Garcia was having 
trouble adjusting to the wider 
gaps tackles need to defend, but he was generally pleased with 
how the redshirt junior has 
played this year. He said Gar-
cia was one of three linemen he was happy with — right guard Jon Halapio and center Jon Har-
rison were the others.
With UF struggling to move 
the ball, Pease has tried to sim-
plify the offense in order to get it moving faster — changing 
protection schemes and focus-
ing on what the Gators do well. 
Garcia said the offense is try-
ing to go back to simpler game 
plans the team has gotten away 
from.
Changing an offense halfway 
through the season is a desper-
ate move for a team in a desper-ate position — one win over .500 and one loss away from having any chance at an SEC title be eliminated.
“It could be the problem for 
the whole offense,” wide receiv-er Trey Burton said. 
“We’ll find out this week 
how well we react to it and ad-just to it.”WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Damontre Harris poses during Florida’s basketball media day. Harris, who transferred from South 
Carolina prior to last season, has dealt with several injuries before playing for the Gators.
Harris improving offensively for UF
“Just working under coach Donovan and his 
style, the way he kind of works you out, it’s a lot of 
skill work. I feel that helps me out a lot.”
Donovan said during media day that he would 
experiment with a lineup featuring Harris at center 
and Patric Young at power forward this season. But 
with a shorthanded roster in practice, the big men have squared off against each other on separate teams. 
Young is optimistic about Harris’ future despite 
the redshirt junior’s conditioning struggles.
“It’s a process for him,” Young said. “He’s defi-
nitely been working hard. He’s starting to figure things out, I believe. He’s starting to realize that you 
need to be in practice consistently every day going at 
it to see results.”
Walker opts to not redshirt: Donovan mulled the 
possibility of redshirting DeVon Walker, who rarely saw the court for the Gators last season.
But after practice last Thursday, he pulled the 
sophomore forward to the side and told him the de-cision to redshirt was in Walker’s hands, according to the team website. 
Walker needed to make the decision before Flori-
da’s scrimmage against Georgia Tech on Saturday in Valdosta, Ga. If he were to play, a non-medical red-shirt would be out of the question, per NCAA rules.
“He told me that I had a chance to play this sea-
son, and not just five minutes here or choppy min-
utes there,” Walker said in a release. “He told me I 
could actually contribute, that he believed in me, but that he’d understand whatever I wanted to do.”  
After discussing the situation with his family, 
Walker participated Saturday.
“I have to trust what he says ... and I do,” Walker 
said. “If he gives me the go-ahead and says I can play and contribute, I’m going to take him at his word and just go with it.”hARRiS , from page 13
Failing in Jacksonville again this 
year will make the next Bulldogs 
question at a Gator Club meeting more awkward and pointed than lighthearted.
Another loss to Georgia this 
season could drop Muschamp into 
a funk similar to what Mark Richt 
endured during his first 10 seasons in Athens, Ga.
Richt won just two of 10 meet-
ings against the Gators from 2001-2010. Losses to UF in 2002 and 2005 derailed two promising national 
title contenders.
Richt tried his share of gimmicks 
to snap out of it.
He sent the entire team onto the 
field to celebrate the Bulldogs’ first 
touchdown in a 42-30 win against the Gators in 2007, but UGA ended up dropping its next three con-tests. 
In 2009, he tried firing up his 
team by outfitting them in black 
helmets and blacks pants. But those were quickly ditched after a 41-17 
loss to Florida.
Imagine the can of worms Richt 
would have opened had he started guaranteeing wins.
Maybe Richt has finally fig-
ured it out with two straight wins. Or maybe, in Muschamp, he has found an opponent even more un-lucky than him.
Last year’s six-turnover effort 
by a team that won 11 games large-ly due to a strong turnover margin would qualify as unlucky, right?
No matter what the coaches say, 
Florida and Georgia are not play-ing for a championship on Satur-day. Not without Missouri’s help, anyway.
This year’s entry in the rivalry 
marks only the second time in the past 34 years that both teams enter the game with three or more losses. At this point, it’s all pride.
Muschamp will have another 
shot to reach Atlanta in 2014, but every chance he misses against Georgia, the harder it will be to turn the tide in his favor.“We had too many 
negative plays. It’s 
hard for them. It’s 
hard because they get 
matchups.”

Jimmy Clark does not let any-
thing slow him down.
The junior suffered a quad in-
jury during a running accident 
prior to the Wisconsin adidas In-
vitational on Oct. 19, forcing him 
to wait on the sidelines while the rest of the team prepared for the meet.
But despite missing several 
workouts while healing from the injury, Clark ran a personal-best race on the Thomas Zimmer Championship Course in Madi-
son, Wis., ﬁ  nishing 30th out of 
288 runners with a time of 23:52 — the 10th fastest 8K in Florida history. 
The only Gator to top Clark in 
Wisconsin was senior Mark Par-rish, who broke the school’s 8K record at the meet.
“To come off injury and be 
able to be right where I was at earlier this season was great,” Clark said. 
“It was exactly what coach 
(Paul Spangler) wanted out of me and what I wanted out of my-self. It was great just to be able to come in behind [Parrish] and to lead the team to a successful 
race.”
Clark is now turning his at-
tention to Friday’s Southeastern Conference Championships on 
the Mark Bostick Golf Course, hoping to help the team improve from its ﬁ  fth-place ﬁ  nish last sea-son.
“I’m just going to do whatever 
Coach needs me to do to help the team out and get a win,” he said.
The SEC Championships will 
be the second time the Gators run on their home course this season. They hosted the Mountain Dew 
Invitational on Sept. 14. 
Clark was the top runner in 
that race with a time of 23:53.78.
“It was great earlier this sea-
son to get a win on the course, to 
preview the course,” Clark said. “We’re excited.”
Hines likely to return for 
SECs: After sitting out of both the FLRunners.com Invitational and the Wisconsin adidas Invita-tional, junior JL Hines is expected to run at the SEC Championships on Friday.
“(The next couple days) are 
going to be a good indicator on whether he’ll be able to run,” 
Spangler said. “But I’m pretty 
optimistic JL will be able to run.”
Hines ran in the ﬁ  rst two races for Florida this season. He ﬁ  nished fourth for UF and sixth overall at the Western Carolina Invitational with a time of 15:23.11 in the 5K race on Aug. 30. He was also the fourth Florida runner to cross the ﬁ  nish line at the Mountain Dew Invitational, completing the race in 24:40.75.
