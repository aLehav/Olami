� SOME PILLS, SUCH AS YAZ

  U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion committees plan to meet Thurs-day to discuss the risks of some birth control pills, including Yaz and Yas-min. 
  Birth control pills that include 
drospirenone might be associated with an increased risk of blood clots, according to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration preliminary study. Drospirenone is a form of the contra-ceptive hormone progestin.
  The preliminary study found 
that women who take pills contain-ing drospirenone are 1.5 times more likely to be at risk for blood clots than women on other contraceptives. 
  The FDA announcement also list-
ed smoking, obesity and family his-tory as factors that can increase the chance of a blood clot. 
  GatorWell Health Promotion Spe-
cialist Samantha Evans said students sometimes ask her speciﬁ  cally about Yaz or Yasmin because they have seen advertisements or know some-one who takes one of them.  FDA to discuss risk of

� IT IS THE FIRST PUBLIC 
LIBRARY IN CAP-HAITIAN.
MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Staff Writer
Several UF organizations are 
partnering to collect books and 
raise money to establish the first public library in Cap-Haitian, a city in northern Haiti.
Projects for Haiti Inc., a nonprof-
it organization started by two UF students, will send a group of about 30 people to Haiti from March 3 to March 9 to set up the library, said co-founder Bertrhude Albert.
Volunteers will also be helping 
build a church, working at orphan-ages, teaching English classes and doing other work during the trip. 
Albert’s father, Isaac, runs a 
church there, but moved it to a new building and donated the old one to the organization in September.
Albert, a 21-year-old English se-
nior, said the first floor of the three-story building will be converted to a community center that will host different events. 
The second floor will be the li-
brary, which will include books ranging from children’s stories to novels. 
The library will be split into four 
sections of books according to lan-guage: English, French, Spanish and Creole. 
“Hopefully, with this library, it’s 
going to be an arena for people to try to learn English,” Albert said. 
Knowing the English language 
can help give Haitians an edge when applying for jobs, she said. 
Projects for Haiti is getting help 
from several organizations in col-lecting books and raising money to fund this library, including the Center for Latin American Studies, UF McNair Scholars Program, Club Creole, Gators United for Haiti and Chi Alpha at UF.
The book drop-off station for the 
McNair Scholars Program is on the third floor of the infirmary.
The Center for Latin American 
Studies has a book drop-off station at its office in Grinter Hall.  
“I know that this library is go-
ing to bring so much hope to north-ern Haiti and equip Haitians in a powerful way. I’m always seeing if people want to partner up with us,” Albert said. “It’s definitely a lot of work, but it’s worth it.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011

Robots that can mow lawns, throw flames and extin-
guish fires are landing on the Reitz Union Colonnade this 
afternoon.
Gator Robotics, along with students from the Intelli-
gent Machines Design Laboratory course, is showcasing more than 20 machines from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Camilo Buscaron, a 22-year-old computer engineering 
junior and president of Gator Robotics, said this is the school’s first Robotics Fair. “We’re hoping to make UF the leading university for 
robotics,” Buscaron said.
He expects 100 to 200 people to at-
tend.
One robot to be showcased is the In-
stiGator, which won a division of the ION Robotic Lawn Mower Competition 
in 2011. Three or four internationally recognized submarines, including the SubjuGator, will also be shown.
“We’ve built these robots from scratch and throughout 
the semester,” Buscaron said.  Kevin French, an 18-year-old material sciences and 
engineering freshman, said he knew he wanted to join a robotics club when he came to UF.
He currently is working on a robot that can solve maz-
es and eventually follow a line. 
French doesn’t know what profession he wants to spe-
cialize in after school, but he said the club is helping him decide. 
“They’ve made me realize that I think I want to switch 
my major to aerospace or mechanical [engineering],” French said.Robotics club, class to showcase machines at Reitz on CAmpus

Deep in his cavern of pearls, 
acoustic guitars and rifles, Richard 
Selwach searches for new treasure.
Selwach, the 49-year-old owner 
of Best Jewelry & Loan Pawn Bro-kers, is one of eight people run-ning for the At-Large 1 seat on the Gainesville City Commission. This will be the fifth time he’s run for a seat on the commission.
The man who’s been bartering 
and trading for 26 years hopes to spend three years negotiating with city politicians. 
A woman brought a golden piece 
of jewelry to Selwach at a counter in his pawn shop. He looked at it for two seconds.
“That’s plated brass,” he said.Another woman set a gleaming 
mandolin in front of him.
“How about $25?”People walk in from the parking 
lot to a view of the pawn shop’s out-side painting, which is made to look like a galaxy of orange, yellow and blue planets — plus a spaceship.
They file in and out of the store as 
Selwach goes through their orders at an auctioneer’s pace.
Scattered around his pawn shop 
are knickknacks or treasures, de-pending on who you talk to.
An Egyptian bust gazes over the 
line of customers. A chest-high stack of books sits next to a 5-foot-tall stack of drums.
Two Publix Grade A egg car -
tons hold a dozen golf balls each. A Dance Man slot machine rests on a counter top.
Ten blue lawn signs that read 
“Selwach for City Commission” rest in a cracked plastic bin.
At the front of the store is Selwa-
ch himself, clad in a button-down white shirt and jeans with straight hair that falls three inches down his shoulders.
Born in Queens, N.Y ., he moved 
to Miami when he was 3 and grew up near Little Havana.
When he was 17, he enrolled at 
UF as a business student and earned his associate’s degree.
He left to open his pawn shop 
at 22. He was, and still is, 21 credits away from his bachelor’s degree.
He said he tried to go back to col-lege in 1992 to finish his degree, but an injury kept him away after a bus crashed into his car.
He said he is running for city 
commission again because people keep asking him to run.
“I’m a fighter,” he said. “It’s like 
a David-and- Goliath thing.”
When he gets excited about what 
he’s saying, he waves his hands around his body to emphasize his points.
He’s basing his platform on get-
ting rid of the city’s contract with a biomass plant, keeping the commis-sion fiscally responsible and clean-ing up trash in the city.
“The best thing about Gainesville 
is our clean air, our clean water, our trees and the University of Florida,” he said. “I’m an environmentalist. A real environmentalist … Whatever we do to the web of life, we do to ourself.”
He said he’s for no new taxes and 
doesn’t support soft closing of bars — a policy that would change clos-ing hours from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. for city bars but would require bars to stop serving alcohol at 2 a.m.
“Two o’clock is fine. You’re here 
to go ahead and study ,” he said. “If you want to party like that, you can do it at home and buy your liquor early.” WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Did you read the Alligator at all this 
semester?
63 TOTAL VOTES67% YES
33% NOMonday’s question: Are you actually   doing evaluations for your professors?Well, it’s the end of the Fall semester, and this is the last 
issue of the year. Although it’s Wednesday, we can’t end 
the year without giving you our last well-we-sure-have-had-fun-pissing-you-off-this-semester edition of ...
Darts and Laurels
To start off this final edition of the semester, we will 
give you two fresh items worthy of attention. 
Then, we will revisit some other big events this semes-
ter. 
To start off, we’re going to pelt a better-not-pack-your-
toy-lightsabers-the-next-time-you-fly DART to the TSA  
for detaining a Florida teen because her purse had an im-age of a pistol on it. 
Good call, TSA. Wouldn’t want her to hijack the plane 
with her purse. 
Next, for showing a tremendous level of creativity, we 
give an enjoy-your-free-”physical”-exams-in-prison LAU-
REL to Phillip Winikoff. Winikoff was recently sentenced 
to 13 months in jail for posing as a doctor and going door to door giving free “breast exams.” Who in their right mind would agree to this? 
Now, it’s time to look at some highlights from this se-
mester. 
First, we toss a trying-to-protect-us-by-controlling-us 
DART to all of the busybodies this year who have tried to 
get us to “behave” by regulating, taxing and, if that doesn’t work, banning everything we do. This semester, we have talked about bureaucrats and officials  accusing children of “sexual harassment,” taxing Christmas trees to promote Christmas trees, overcrowding prisons with non-violent drug offenders, banning empty water bottles from  football games, enforcing laws against nonmarried couples living together and banning kayaks at Poe Springs. 
After a year of controversy, we give a thanks-for-
finally-allowing-people-to-help-each-other LAUREL to 
the Gainesville City Commission for ending the limit on 
meals that can be given to the homeless at soup kitchens in the city. These sorts of ordinances do way more harm than good, and the city made the right decision. 
Of course, we cannot end the semester without giv-
ing a way-to-screw-up-in-every-possible-way-imaginable DART to the UF Student Government. You screwed up 
the elections, pretended like nothing went wrong and, when the facts were presented to you, held no one account-able for your mistakes. Good job. 
For our final award of the semester, we give a thank-
you-for-giving-us-a-purpose LAUREL to the Alligator 
readers. Without our readers, there would be no point in doing what we do every week. 
We also want to thank all of our readers for interacting 
with the Alligator on the website and through letters to the editor. We have enjoyed the discussion. 
Have a fun and safe break, and be sure to check back 
next semester! Life after college still full of uncertainty
Life is in flux. 
I mean that on a general level and also personal.
Life is always in motion, but for me in particular, 
graduation looms in less than two weeks. Graduation, as many of you are probably experiencing, will come with a lot of changes. 
Apart from the “I’ll never take a class again, but I feel 
like kindergarten was yesterday” shock, graduation for me will soon mean moving to a new city for a job. It’ll mean leaving the office of the Alligator, where I’ve worked for a year and a half, for a position in another (much larger) newsroom. It’ll mean having to live in a world where not everything is orange and blue.
And when contemplating the future of life after gradu-
ation, I found so much has happened in the past few years that I’m only realizing now.
These past few years have been about discovering that 
learning is more than memorizing the contents of a book. The years have been filled with lots of laughs, plenty of exciting characters (including several at the Alligator), and the struggle between parents’ expectations and personal dreams that don’t match up. 
And sometimes — especially right now during finals 
week — college is just nothing but continuous stress.
But then there’s the fact that college is the perfect limbo 
status. Being in college means growing up and taking re-sponsibilities, but it’s also a time when you still get to be a goofy kid at heart. The real world of full-time jobs and bills, bills, bills — none of which Bright Futures can help you with — is still, for most, lingering in the distance.
From the time I was a high school freshman, I had my 
college career planned to a “T.” And I’ve executed that plan. The time spent executing that plan was supposed to be the time where I made my next plan — a plan for the rest of my life after college. 
But it didn’t happen. I hit this last semester and  realized 
I had no real plans for life after graduation. The things I had wanted not so long ago — like a master’s degree in creative writ-ing — were things I didn’t want anymore.
I remember thinking a couple of years ago that after col-
lege, I’d have all of the answers. Graduating with a prob-able job already in hand, I may have more security than most. But do I have all of the answers? No. If anything, I have more questions.
College has been something of a redefining time for 
me, as it is for many others. It’s a time when people who thought they knew who they were, what made them happy and what they wanted discover they may not really know at all.
And that’s a bonding experience. You make friends with 
those around you because in the short term, your lives all have the same immediate goal: graduation. But the world is bigger than college, and life after graduation means con-fronting the fact that anyone could, and will, go anywhere and everywhere. 
As a character in one of my favorite Indian films, “Dil 
Chahta Hai” (What the Heart Wants), expresses to his friends after graduation, “We’ll soon set sail for our destina-tions. Our destinations might not coincide.” We’re friends for life, he says, but we don’t know where life will take us.
Some of us have an idea where we’re going and with 
whom; some of us have none. And that’s OK.
Because, in the end, life is a series of moments, and even 
the best of us can’t plan everything because everything in-evitably changes.
To the freshmen, let me share a bit of outgoing senior 
knowledge: Life isn’t actually something you figure out in college.
If anything, college has taught me that I can’t figure out 
life — and that I shouldn’t try.

Greed stands in the way 
of “American Dream”
Travis Hornsby’s col-
umn this week completely 
missed the mark.
He failed to understand 
why millions of Americans are frustrated with the 1 percent. The 99 percent are upset because the world has finite resources, and the 1 percent gobble them up and leave nothing for the rest of us.
Here’s another take on 
John Locke’s “apple tree” metaphor. Sure, if you pick the apples from the tree, you have done the work and are entitled to said apples. But imagine a small group of people picking more than they can eat and not giving the rest of us an opportunity to pick any .  
We were willing to do the 
work, and there were plenty of apples to go around. Heck, there were even enough apples for some to pick extra, but the small group had to be greedy.
Here’s another example. 
If I’m told my whole life that the American dream is to own a home, and a reputable bank sells me a mortgage for a $250,000 home when I only make $50,000 (Hornsby’s example was inflated to fit his argu-ment), whose fault is it that I trusted the bank to not take a stupid risk?
In reality , banks made 
mountains of cash selling mortgages to people who couldn’t afford them.  The bank was the sleazy used car salesman, and I was the poor sap who didn’t know much about cars but was told by experts that I made the right move.

Letter to the Editor
A plan currying favor with the Occupy Wall Street crowd is loan forgiveness, which serves to under -
mine the integrity of the financial system in return 
for the fluff that it professes.
Loan forgiveness is a concept where loans will be for -
given after a certain period of time is reached or a certain set of circumstances are met. It can also involve payment by a third party . 
Given the level of government debt, this is unwise and 
unlikely . This program would be little more than a backdoor tax to pay for education without talking about realities.
This is a pipe dream by a bunch of hippies who fail to 
understand how loans work. Student loans are given by in-stitutions based on a principle plus interest to be amortized over many years. The interest is reflective of many factors, including the risk that students will default on their loans.
Loan forgiveness is a default minus the hit to a student’s 
credit that would happen otherwise. It basically wipes the slate clean. The student gains, the bank loses.
By the bank losing money, the institution is forced to 
make it up somehow, because there is no such thing as a free lunch. A loan forgiveness program is asking the bank to take a hit unless the federal government pays the bank back.
Occupy Wall Street would prefer it if banks were the 
ones taking the check. In order to make up for forgiveness, banks will be forced to increase interest rates. These rates will be high enough to harm students who had every inten-tion of paying off their debt.
This is where another person without a background in common sense would step in with the idea of a government-enforced ceiling on interest rates.
This idea would also fail to gain 
traction.
By setting a government ceiling, rates would not be al-
lowed to exceed a certain amount. Students would pay the lower rate regardless of the actual risk they might default. This would be great, except banks would most likely lose money at the rate acceptable to Occupy Wall Street.
Loan forgiveness strikes at the very core of responsibility. 
The idea that it is acceptable to shirk a responsibility about which someone gave their word is just a sign of the unfortu-nate times we live in. 
College is expensive. No one denies that point, but banks 
should not have to take a loss for your education.
The art of appealing to constituents is often a disgusting 
one. In this case, a bunch of hippies under the influence are pushing a program further disseminated by liberal propa-ganda. Here is the rebuttal: Loans should not be forgiven except under extraordinary circumstances. If college is too expensive, schools should consider letting in more students rather than continuing to boast about their student-teacher ratios and rejection rates.
Ultimately , loan forgiveness does little to change the cost 
of education; it only serves to scapegoat major banks. For this reason, we must pass.

UWireplace in Sarasota out of con-
sideration for the oldest mem-bers of the family.
The children get mounds 
of presents, and the young adults get cash.
“It’s more practical,” Hua 
said. 
The adults don’t get gifts, 
except for the elders, who get gifts out of respect.
They go to Catholic Mass 
and hear about a baby in a manger, but the main stories of the holiday revolve around their own family.
Her grandfather, who was 
born in Vietnam, came to the U.S. with half of his children.
Hua said her aunts and un-
cles laugh as they retell how they fought over the one bed in their two-bedroom home.
Now the family is spread 
among several cities.
“I think that’s why they’re 
grateful to spend time with family: because they spend so much time apart,” she said.
French, an 18-year-old materials science and engi-neering freshman, celebrates Christmas and Hanukkah, but he admits he’s not very con-sistent with celebrating Ha-nukkah.
“If we remember, we light 
the menorah at sundown,” French said.
The tree is decorated with 
Jewish colors, but this year, red sneaked in.
During Hanukkah, he’ll 
get chocolate as gifts  and eats latkes and pot roast.
When Christmas Day ar-
rives, he’ll celebrate with a big egg-and-sausage breakfast at his mom’s house.
“All the wonderful break-
fast stuff,” he said.
Then it’s off to his dad’s 
house for lunch.
“By dinnertime, all I want 
to do is sleep,” he said.
As far as gifts go, he’s ask-
ing only for running shoes and a new watch to replace his old one.
“I never know what I want 
for Christmas,” he said.
He thought about it.“I want free A’s,” he said.Students celebrate with

In many ways, Joanna Byun is an average 
college freshman. 
Byun, 19, lives on campus, hangs out with 
her friends and has dreams of changing the 
world.
But unlike most of her friends at UF, Byun 
needs an interpreter to help her understand her professors. 
She is one of 30 hearing-impaired students 
registered with the Disability Resource Center this semester but only one of three who uses an interpreter.
Byun sometimes works with Signing 
Gators, the American Sign Language club on campus.
She’s more of a helper than an official 
member, she said.
Mostly , she keeps the group updated on 
American Sign Language slang signs and awareness issues because, she said, “I’m obvi-ously a deaf culture expert.”
There are two kinds of people in the deaf 
community, Byun said.
There are deaf people with a lowercase “d,” 
who might have a cochlear implant or a hear -
ing aid and don’t usually use interpreters.
“They hide their deafness,” she said. “They 
don’t want people to know.” 
There are also Deaf people with a capital 
“D,” who, she said, use interpreters and sign language and are comfortable letting people know they are hearing-impaired.
“I’m a big ‘D,’” Byun said. She uses three different interpreters to help 
her with her four classes at UF.
Byun lip-reads, but nobody can read lips and take notes at the same time, she said.
“I can’t believe how much I miss just by 
looking down,” she said.
In addition to her interpreters, who are 
paid by UF as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Disability Resource Cen-ter provides a note-taker for Byun. 
She said she’s never had a problem with 
the resources provided by the Disability Re-source Center. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act of 2004 established accommodations AT public schools for students with disabilities.However, the act allows states to deter -
mine their own requirements for school inter -
preters.
Since then, 26 states have adopted the Edu-
cational Interpreter Performance Assessment, a standardized national interpreter certifica-tion.
The test has proved more difficult than 
many states’ certifications, causing a shortage of interpreters in some areas.
Currently, Florida does not require inter -
preters to take the EIPA.   
There’s also no shortage of interpreters at UF, said Chanda McCann, a learning specialist in the Disability Resource Center.
UF gets interpreters from the Center for In-
dependent Living, a nonprofit support center for people with disabilities.
“It’s a pretty smooth process,” McCann 
said.
There are four interpreters at UF this se-
mester, said Kathy Elkins, ASL interpreting coordinator at the Center for Independent Liv-ing in Gainesville.
The average is three or four, depending on 
how many deaf students are enrolled. All of the staff and freelance interpreters at the Cen-ter for Independent Living are certified by the state of Florida, Elkins said.
Mike Tuccelli, who teaches ASL at UF, was 
a deaf student at UF in the 1990s.
The university was very accommodating to 
him then, he wrote in an email, but there are many more options for deaf students now.
UF even graduated a deaf medical student 
thanks to the support of the Disability Re-source Center, he said.
Byun agreed that UF has been helpful.She just wishes her professors would re-
member they’re supposed to give a 15-minute break for the interpreters when a class lasts for more than one class period.
“They have to sign so fast,” she said. “I see 
them stretching their hands. They’re going to get arthritis!”8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011

hoLIDA yS,
from page 1Club raised $20,000 at last year’s sale
tion.
 This year, $3,000 has been budgeted to fund under -
graduate students who perform research, said Jim Bar -
rett, a professor of environmental horticulture. 
“Without the sale, I don’t know what would hap-
pen to the club,” said Gina DeFalco, the club’s secretary 
and a 22-year-old environmental horticulture senior.  
The club raised $20,000 at last year’s sale, a consistent figure over the years, Barrett said.
Prices range from $10 to $40, depending on the size, 
breed and color of the plant, DeFalco said.  
There are 160 varieties of plants in the greenhouses. Mark Keeley, a 22-year-old landscape and nursery 
management senior, was the designated grower for this year’s sale. Each year, Keeley said, Barrett chooses a different student to help grow the plants. 
“I make decisions about the amount to grow, the lo-
cation to grow it in, the pot size, growth regulars and fertilizer applications,” Keeley said.
UF grows the poinsettias to study how the plants 
fare in Florida’s climate. The plants are originally from the mountains of Guatemala and Mexico. 
The sale began when consumers expressed an in-
terest in purchasing the plants, and students began to grow plants for sale.
“It’s fun to produce for consumers and for academ-
ics and for the challenges in producing them,” Keeley said.
People line up for the sale early Thursday morning 
to purchase the multicolored plants, he said.
Adam Moseley, a 26-year-old environmental horti-
culture senior, stopped by the greenhouse Wednesday to purchase three plants for his mom: one white, one burgundy and one peach plant.
“I figured coming early, I would get premium crop,” 
he said.
The sale will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday 
and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday.PoINSETTIAS , from page 1
SHCC fills about 100 prescriptions daily
Evans said she usually talks to 
the students about less expensive 
and lower-progestin options, es-pecially if they have never taken oral contraceptives.
Courtenay Barrett, a 20-year-
old telecommunication junior, said her aunt, who was taking Yaz, developed a blood clot while she was on a plane. 
Barrett said that not long after, her father’s secretary had to have her pancreas removed because of problems with her Yaz pills. 
When one of her friends ex-
pressed an interest in the brand, Barrett discouraged her. “I don’t see why anybody 
would if it could even possibly give you those risks,” she said.
UF Student Health Care Cen-
ter Pharmacy Manager Laura Tipton said oral contraceptives make up at least half the business at the pharmacy. She estimated that about 100 prescriptions are filled each day. 
Each one includes a drug in-
formation leaflet, as required by the FDA.

UF Student Senate Judiciary Chairman 
Aundre Price stood at the podium in front of 
the Senate the same way he does every Tues-day night. 
Price said he couldn’t come up with a tacky 
holiday sweater, so he turned his jacket in-side out to reveal the shiny lining and pulled on multicolored striped socks under his dress shoes.
Senators clad in Santa hats, jingling vests 
and one musical tie passed a resolution recog-nizing Christmas and Hanukkah as religious holidays.
According to the bill, individuals in the past attempted to rename Christmas trees as holiday trees and change menorahs to candle-sticks.
Graduate Senator Austin Brockmeier pro-
posed that section of the bill be removed be-cause it doesn’t promote the goodwill cited in the bill as the hallmarks of the holidays.
Senate President Andy Mason, who was 
one of the bill’s five authors, said the bill itself didn’t need to promote goodwill, just protect traditions.
“That needs to be preserved by upholding 
the original meanings,” he said.
The Senate also passed a resolution honor -
ing UF student Jade Guzzo, who died in a car accident Thanksgiving weekend. 
Senators Katie Waldman and Matt Mount-
joy, who are chairing the elections rules com-mittee, said the elections revisions would be presented at the first Senate meeting next se-mester.Student Senate recognizes

UF’s animal sciences department and the Dairy Science 
Club will be partnering to sell baskets filled with summer 
sausage and cheddar cheese.
The proceeds will help fund the travel for three of UF’s 
Intercollegiate Judging Teams, including a livestock judging team, a meat judging team and a meat-animal evaluation team. The dairy club and the animal sciences department will also benefit from the sales, said Rebecca Matta, the de-partment’s program assistant.The sausage is entirely made on campus by students. The 
cheese is made with milk from cows from across the South-east.
Basket prices range from $8 to $28. This is the second year 
the sale is taking place.  “We hope to increase our sales each year,” Matta said. The holiday gift baskets are available for pickup at the 
Animal Sciences Meat Laboratory on Dec. 9 and 16, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Isabel Cardozo, a 19-year-old applied physiology and ki-
nesiology freshman, said she would buy a basket to support the cause.
“I’m obsessed with cheese,” Cardozo said. “Well, I’m a 
vegetarian, but I would buy a basket for someone to help out.”

Whether the weather or the curriculum is 
to blame, four Florida universities recently 
ranked on the Princeton Review’s top 20 list of colleges where students study the least.
UF is ranked No. 14, the lowest out of the 
Florida schools included.
Florida State University rung in at No. 9, 
the University of South Florida at No. 5 and the University of Central Florida at No. 4.
It’s not unusual for multiple schools in 
a region to rank in the same category, said Robert Franek, author of Princeton Review’s “The Best 376 Colleges, 2012 Edition.” 
The Princeton Review determined these 
rankings by collecting surveys from 122,000 students enrolled at the 376 schools chosen for the book. The data used in this edition was from 2008, 2009 and 2010.
An average of 325 students per school re-
sponded to the survey, but UF’s participation rate was probably higher, Franek said.
Students were asked, “How many out-
of-class hours do you spend studying per day?” 
They answered with one of the following: 
“five or more,” “four hours,” “three hours,” “two hours” or “one hour or less.” 
UF ranked No. 12 on the list last year and 
No. 8 the year before, Franek said. 
The survey used the blanket term “study-
ing” to include homework and test prep.
“With 50,000 students, their study habits 
vary greatly,” Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw wrote in an email. “Ask any architecture major  — they 
are in their studies 24/7.”
Earlier this year, 31 percent of 19,325 UF 
students reported that they study 16 or more 
hours per week, according to the Student Ex-perience Research University . This number is up from 26 percent in 2009.
It’s hard to tell whether these study rates 
will increase when Library West is open 24 hours in the Spring, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Regardless of ranking, Shaw wants stu-
dents to take care of themselves while they study . “Eat nutritional food, get enough rest, take breaks to exercise and have a positive frame of mind,” she said. EMILY MORROW

When Christina Ertel has a hangover, 
she cures it with food.
The 22-year-old political science senior 
said after a long night, she turns to either 
greasy food or Krishna Lunch, accompa-nied by lots of water and Advil.
But now, Ertel may have another op-
tion: Blowfish, a new over-the-counter hangover cure that has recently hit the market.
A combination of 1,000 milligrams of 
aspirin and 120 milligrams of caffeine, the dissolvable tablets are recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a safe, effective method for treating hang-overs.
Developed in New York City, Blowfish 
was just placed in New York drug stores and will be expanding across the country soon, according to its website. It is cur -
rently available online in a 12-tablet box for $11.99 or a 50-tablet box for $49.99. 
The recommended treatment is to dis-
solve two Blowfish tablets in a cup of wa-ter when you wake up with a hangover. It supposedly works in 15 to 30 minutes. 
Ertel said at that price, essentially $2 
per cure, she would definitely try it.
“I spend more than that on food the 
next day,” she said.
But William Chen, a professor in UF’s 
health education and behavior depart-ment, said he doesn’t know that Blowfish is the best idea for students to use.
The compounds in Blowfish only treat 
some of the symptoms of hangovers, he said, like headaches and fatigue. It doesn’t actually cure the hangover.
Hangovers are caused when a person’s 
body fails to metabolize all the alcohol in his or her system, Chen said, calling it a “toxic reaction.”
Each person’s response to alcohol de-
pends on his or her genetic makeup.
Blowfish is more similar to a cold medi-
cine, he said, in that it will help you feel more alert and take away aches and pains, but it is not a unique formula.
Chen said he’s concerned that products 
like Blowfish will encourage binge drink-ing — a common problem on college cam-puses.
By giving students a treatment that’s 
advertised as a guaranteed cure, he said he worries they will feel invincible, like they can go out and drink anything without consequences.
“A hangover means you drank too 
much,” he said. “Go out and enjoy drink-ing, but do it responsibly.”10, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011

Senior point guard Erving Walker said he isn’t worried by losses to Ohio State and Syracuse but that the 
Gators need to snag a quality nonconference win. Florida plays Arizona tonight at 7 in the O’Connell Center.
� UF HAD 36 TURNOVERS 
IN LOSSES TO OSU, ‘CUSE.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
After Florida was knocked 
off in its first two attempts at an 
impressive nonconference win, coach Billy Donovan made it clear there is no shame in losing to top-three teams on the road.
What is disappointing is how 
the Gators fell.
In a pair of single-digit losses 
to unbeaten No. 2 Ohio State and undefeated No. 3 Syracuse, Florida committed 36 turnovers, leading to a combined 30 points scored for the Buckeyes and the Orange.
“Our guys understand that 
playing the second game of the year at Ohio State, going to Syracuse — I’m not so sure how many teams would be favored going into both of those teams’ gyms,” Donovan said. “We got one of the better teams in the country coming in here Wednes-day, but you’ve got to put your -
selves in the position where you don’t beat yourselves.”
Starting tonight at 7 against 
Arizona (6-2), No. 12 Florida (5-2) will play two teams this month that have been ranked, the other being No. 22 Texas A&M. Arizona slipped out of the polls following losses to No. 17 Mississippi State and San Di-ego State.
Though there are still op-
portunities on UF’s schedule to boost its NCAA Tournament résumé, senior guard Erving Walker knows the Gators will have to eventually win a mar -
quee game and not rely on their strength of schedule for that to happen.
“We’ve only played two, 
so we’ve still got a lot more to go,” Walker said. “But I think it would be 
pointless if we just lost them all, but 
let’s just hope that won’t hap-pen. I don’t think that will hap-pen.”
In order to do that, Florida 
will have to work on its deci-sion-making. 
Arizona generally employs 
a small lineup that can delve into four guards on the floor at one time. While the Gators’ own backcourt-heavy roster can matchup well with the Wildcats’ size, any Florida turnovers could quickly be converted into points by Arizona’s up-tempo style. 
“When they’re playing four Florida looking to minimize mistakes against Arizona tonight

Becoming Florida’s coach four years 
ago was a welcome homecoming for 
UF alum Amanda Butler, but ventur -
ing outside of Gainesville has been problematic.
Since taking over the Gators in 2007, 
Butler’s squads have recorded a 20-32 record on the road, including a 7-15 mark against nonconference foes.
As Florida (6-2) prepares for its first 
true road game of the season tonight against San Francisco (1-8), Butler is aiming to reverse UF’s fortunes away from home.“We certainly need to start tackling 
some of those challenges — not having 
the chance just to be in Florida or to be at home,” Butler said. “All of the things, all of the adversity you expect with the road, start facing some of 
that, learning what that means, what 
that feels like and finding ways to win in those environments.”
A typical struggle of playing on the 
road is dealing with unfamiliar settings Gators travel cross-country

When four-star recruit Mike Davis de-
committed Sunday night, the Gators lost 
one of the top running backs in the class of 2012.
Tuesday afternoon, they lost out on an-
other one.
Four-star running back Keith Marshall 
of Raleigh (N.C.) Millbrook High, rated the No. 1 all-purpose back in the nation by Rivals.com, orally committed to Geor -
gia during a ceremony at his school that was streamed live on the Internet.
Marshall chose Georgia over Florida, 
Clemson and South Carolina.
“I just slept on it (Tuesday) morn-
ing and my heart told me to go to Geor -
gia,” Marshall told Scout.com on the live stream.
His decision to commit to Georgia, where he plans to enroll early in January, leaves UF with just one running back com-mit for the 2012 class: four-star prospect Matt Jones of Seffner Armwood High. 
Marshall’s commitment also leaves the 
Gators strapped at running back, as Flori-da was focused mainly on him, Jones and Davis while other top backs committed elsewhere.
With the Gators losing senior running 
backs Jeff Demps and Chris Rain-ey next season, the team will 
likely aim to sign multiple backs in 2013, with Winter Haven High’s Adam Lane, Delray Beach American Heritage School’s Greg Bryant and Belle Glade Glades Day School’s Kelvin Taylor as the top targets.
Oral commitments are nonbinding until a 
national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.Top running back recruit

Shawn Janetzke / Alligator Staffguards, they’ve got the ability to do that, so our abil-
ity to guard those guys will be a great challenge,” Donovan said. “Syracuse does it with length and size and these guys do it with speed and quickness based on the lines they got out there.”
The Gators’ most turnover-prone player early this 
season has been freshman Brad Beal with 19 give-aways. Normally playing guard, the 6-foot-3 Beal has had to move down low to the power forward slot during the last three games due to an injury to 6-foot-10 starter Erik Murphy.
While Murphy will likely make his return against 
Arizona, Donovan said he has been able to live with Beal’s mistakes because of his effort on the boards. Beal has posted three consecutive games of nine re-bounds or more in Murphy’s absence.
“Part of the reason he’s been able to stay on the 
floor for as long as he has is because he is defend-ing and he is rebounding,” Donovan said. “That was one of my concerns when we lost Chandler (Parsons) with our guards is: What kind of rebounding will we get from the small forward spot?”
Contact John Boothe at jboothe@alligator.org.Murphy likely to 
return to lineup against Arizona— something the Gators experienced 
with six new players joining the fold last season.
Florida’s lack of cohesion cost 
them in the early going as it lost five of six away games against nonconfer -
ence foes during the 2010-11 season.
“We were trying to overcome a 
lack of confidence, especially on the road,” Butler said. 
“It turns into a bigger monster 
than it really is because it’s in your mind and that’s what makes it so powerful.”
However, an impressive 6-2 start 
this season has senior guard Jordan Jones brimming with confidence.
Jones believes the Gators are ca-
pable of making the road a home away from home.
“We’re a year older,” she said. 
“You can’t underestimate being more mature, learning those lessons and knowing how tough it is (on the road).”
After a lengthy five-game road 
trip, tonight’s game is San Francisco’s first home appearance since Nov. 18. In the midst of a seven-game losing streak, the Dons will be seeking their first victory since Nov. 13.
Butler expects a big crowd in to-
night’s matchup, labeling it as “a dangerous game.”
“The hostile crowd, I think, is a 
positive sometimes — it energizes you as a competitor,” Butler said.
While UF has yet to face an 
opponent on the road, it has al-ready played games away from the O’Connell Center this year.
During Thanksgiving break, the 
Gators traveled to Brooklyn, N.Y., to play in the Courtyard LaGuardia Turkey Classic. Florida won back-to-back games against La Salle and Charlotte during its stay in New York.
“It‘s just going to prove our matu-
rity level,” senior guard Deana Allen said. 
“We can also win games away 
from our fans.”
Last Friday, UF lost to No. 11 Rut-
gers in a neutral-site game in Day-tona Beach.
While the Gators were playing 
near home, the Scarlet Knights ben-efited from the lack of a strong show-ing by Florida fans.
“It’s not a brand-new experience,” 
Butler said. 
“We’ve already flown a few plac-
es, been on a few buses and been in a few hotels, so this won’t be much different.”18, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011

Freshman guard Carlie Needles plant-
ed her left foot to cut right, but she never 
completed the move.
Needles crumpled to the floor un-
touched after suffering tears to the ante-rior cruciate ligament and meniscus in her left knee.
Just like that, her season was over be-
fore it even began.
Needles is not the first Gator that has 
lost a season due to ACL woes.
Sophomore Lily Svete and senior Ndidi 
Madu, both forwards, also took medical redshirts during their respective freshman seasons due to ACL injuries.
When Needles originally injured her 
knee, she thought she had merely hyper -
extended it and that ice treatments would be the cure.
Madu’s situation was similar.Heading into the 2007-08 campaign, 
the ACL in Madu’s right knee was already partially torn from high school. 
As is common with ACL injuries, 
Madu’s knee locked at the time, but she believed it was just a torn meniscus, which typically takes between two and six weeks to heal.
When Madu eventually suffered the 
complete tear at UF, the extent of her in-jury was still not clear.“When I actually did tear it, it didn’t 
lock and it didn’t swell, so I wasn’t sure what it could be,” Madu said.
An MRI the next day confirmed the in-
jury, and Madu had reconstructive surgery a month later.
The most frustrating part for Madu 
was going through summer and preseason workouts and then watching her team from the bench.
“It’s very difficult,” she said. “You work 
so hard and you’ve done everything up to this point and now it’s time for games. You’re ready to play, and you can’t play.”
Unlike Madu and Needles, Svete knew 
something was wrong immediately.
Coming to a sudden conclusion about 
the severity of her injury was tough for Svete.
“I knew it popped; I knew it happened 
right away,” she said. “The coaches told me, ‘Oh, we don’t know what it is.’ I was like, ‘I really know that I tore my ACL.’”
Svete had the opportunity to play in 
four games before her injury — more than Madu and Needles did combined prior to their respective ACL tears.
However, the pain of missing nearly an 
entire season stung Svete.
“I feel really bad for Carlie because I 
know exactly what she’s feeling,” she said. “She’s not going to get to experience the season at all as a player.”
Having recovered and moved on, Madu and Svete are helping Needles through the rehabilitation process.
From her own experience, Svete told 
Needles what her knee will look like post-surgery, and Madu has used humor to pro-vide needed distraction from the injury.
"You would have no idea that Ndidi or 
Lily even had (injuries) by the way that they move and perform and lift,” Florida coach Amanda Butler said. “They are great examples of what she has to look forward to: not just a full recovery, but maybe even being bigger and better than ever.”
  
Needles will not be the last Gator to 
lose a season due to an ACL injury.
When she went down, it was a situation 
all too familiar for Butler.
“We still haven’t found that magic 
thing to determine why exactly women are more susceptible to ACL tears than men,” Butler said. “They’re just so prevalent in our game.”
Marty Huegel, the director of rehabili-
tation for the University Athletic Associa-tion, is one of many on the hunt.
He said that non-contact ACL injuries, 
like the one Needles suffered, are a grow-ing problem in women's athletics.
“I call them ‘Title IX injuries,’” Huegel 
said. “That’s really how we ended up find-ing out that women are more susceptible to these injuries: due to the numbers play-ing as a result of Title IX.
“You can talk about Title IX being a 
good thing — it may have been good or bad depending on what your viewpoint is.”
Huegel, who has worked with Madu, 
Svete, and now Needles, says women are more prone to non-contact ACL injuries than men.
The Orthopaedic Associates of Michigan 
list differences such as the size of the ACL itself, pelvis width, hormone concentra-tion levels, and varying movements based on knee structure as potential causes.
Despite the distinction between ACL 
injuries in men and women, Huegel main-tains that the rehabilitation is similar for both genders but varies from person to person.
However, one issue Huegel said hin-
ders women returning from a torn ACL is a reluctance to jump and land.
Considering that landing awkwardly 
is one of the main causes of non-contact ACL injuries in women, hesitance is un-derstandable.
In order to overcome that unwillingness 
to leave the feet — and to prevent further injury — Huegel said there are a number of jumping and landing exercises trainers have developed.
“Depending on their level of fear with 
that, that will determine how fast you progress,” he said. “The progression is not time-based; it’s performance-based.”
Some overcome fear quickly and have 
to play the waiting game — something that frustrated Svete.
“It was probably the hardest thing I’ve 
ever been through,” she said. “I was some-one who really pushed myself with the rehab and everything like that every day and it is definitely a big task.” 
The standard recovery time is between 
six and eight months, according to Hue-gel.
However, he acknowledges that while 
a patient may be fully rehabilitated, there are still challenges ahead in readjusting to aspects of the sport.
“The biggest problem working with 
athletes is you have to hold them back,” Huegel said. “They want to do more than they should.”

Needles is getting antsy — sitting on 
the bench does not suit her.
“I’ll just want contact, I’ll just want 
somebody to hit me,” Needles said. “I’ll just want someone to hit me and be able to feel that adrenaline again.”
But physical play is not in her near fu-
ture, so she has focused her energy on film study.
So far, Butler has been more than happy 
to keep Needles involved.
“Carlie’s unique because she’s a point 
guard and she is very much a student of the game,” Butler said. “She still is in all of the point guard meetings, taking notes and doing everything she can to try and develop her mind since her body is on hold here for a few weeks.”
Since the injury, Needles has become 
like an assistant coach and a cheerleader for her teammates.
Her character and demeanor led Butler 
to describe the freshman guard as a “tre-mendous model of leadership.”
“She shed a tear or two at the begin-
ning, and we all did because it’s a hard thing to know that your season’s being taken away from you,” Butler said. “But she hasn’t complained. … I think she’s re-ally been an inspiration to her teammates in that regard.”
Perhaps the most ringing endorsement 
of Needles came from senior guard Jordan Jones.
At the team’s Thanksgiving meal, each 
person gave thanks for the person sitting to their left.
Jones praised Needles’ maturity and 
her selflessness despite being forced to miss the entire season.
“Not one time have I heard her com-
plain; not one time has she come in with a down attitude,” Jones said. “As a fresh-man, she has so much respect from me to be able to handle it that way.”
Needles is just one on a long list of fe-
male athletes to fall victim to a non-contact ACL injury.
Rehabilitation will be a long process, 
but unless researchers can decrease the likelihood of “Title IX injuries,” it is just part of the game.
“Things happen for a reason and I keep 
telling myself that,” Needles said. “It’s the way I was brought up — you just try to overcome things, you don’t try to feel sorry for yourself.” WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 19
