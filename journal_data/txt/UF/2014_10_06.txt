� THE 1-MILE STRETCH WAS 
CLOSED FOR SIX HOURS.

University Avenue came alive Sun-
day afternoon.
Pedestrians reclaimed the streets, 
bicyclists left their bike lanes, and life 
slowed down, if only for a few hours.
Open Streets was the ﬁ  rst event of its 
kind in Gainesville, a celebration of al-ternative transportation and active life-styles that left a 1-mile stretch of Uni-versity Avenue closed to vehicles from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Instead, families walked their dogs 
and their bikes between West Sixth 
Street and East Seventh Street. Infants 
bounced in baby carriers. Toddlers rode bike trailers.
At the intersection of University 
Avenue and Main Street, the road was bathed in a mural of chalk.
It began earlier that morning with 
a mother and son who chose to draw each other’s outlines, holding hands, on 
the corner of the street.
“It set a good tone,” said Erika Ton-
nelier, an artist at Corks and Colors Stu-

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Florida 
players ﬁ  led into the cramped media 
room, tucked away in the bowels of Neyland Stadium’s south end zone.
Each drew its own mingling of 
reporters. Some needed quotes on the run game, others on the crucial turnovers.
Media bounced around, taking 
the essential bits of each interview and ﬂ  ocking to the next athlete.
“How conﬁ  dent were you in 
Austin Hardin in making that 49-yard ﬁ  eld goal?” one journalist 
asked. Quote on the game-winning 
kick? Check.
“This win was big, right? Ten in 
a row against Tennessee means a lot, right?” another recorder shoved in another face. Quote on Rocky Top’s woeful decade? Check.
But then Jeff Driskel entered the 
room.
He took the podium that only 
Will Muschamp used during his postgame press conference, the Gators’ logo backdrop still in the background.
The echoed mumblings bounc-
ing from wall to wall died abruptly. The starting quarterback was about to speak. Everyone listened. Center stage for — perhaps — the last time.
There was nothing spectacular 
about Treon Harris’ ﬁ  rst play against Tennessee on Saturday. He did little more than turn his body to hand the ball over to Matt Jones.
Harris made Florida fans wait. After Driskel, a redshirt junior, threw pick after pick, incompletion after incompletion, Will Muschamp couldn’t hold off any longer.
“In at quarterback for Florida,” 
the PA boomed to the crowd of 102,455.
The fans knew what words were coming next. Ever since Driskel’s outing against Alabama on Sept. 20, the Southeastern Conference learned Harris’ name. UF fans knew Harris’ potential weeks before.
The true freshman, fresh off 
back-to-back state championships at Miami Booker T. Washington 
High, stirred up Florida’s recruiting 
landscape, landing at UF after ﬂ  irt-ing with the idea of playing behind Jameis Winston at FSU.
Harris’ decision to compete 
in Gainesville paid off early. Five weeks into his ﬁ  rst year of eligibility, Harris is in prime position to leap-frog Driskel and become Florida’s 
ﬁ  rst true freshman starting quarter-
back since Jacoby Brissett in 2011.
Brissett lost his battle with Driskel. 
Harris plans to win the war.
Harris’ ﬁ  rst test came Saturday 
in the heart of Knoxville, where the Gators daggered the Volunteers’ hopes of ending a nine-game skid after pulling out an ugly 10-9 vic-
tory.
Had Driskel not exited the con-
test, Muschamp and company had a 
shot at being on the wrong end of a 9-0 shutout — even uglier.
Florida has not been held score-
less since Oct. 29, 1988, a streak un-paralleled among the 128 other FBS schools. Michigan, which was the 
nation’s previous record holder, put VOLUME 109 ISSUE 30 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2014

An unidentiﬁ  ed UF graduate student was 
hospitalized at UF Health Shands Hospital on 
Friday after being diagnosed with meningo-coccal disease.
In an email sent out Friday evening to the 
UF community, Guy W. Nicolette, interim director at the Student Health Care Center, wrote that the Florida Department of Health and the SHCC were closely monitoring the situation. Precautions were also being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
The student in the College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences is under the best of care, accord-ing to the mass email sent out to students.
Andrew Ragsdale, UF Health Communica-
tions marketing coordinator, said he could not conﬁ  rm nor deny a meningitis hospitalization had occurred.
“In these cases, we must keep any private 
information about the patient conﬁ  dential,” he said.According to the Florida Department of 
Health, cases of meningitis are rare in the U.S.
College freshmen, according to the depart-
ment, and those living in dorms are also at risk for meningitis compared to those who are not attending college.
Symptoms of meningitis include a sudden 
fever, an intense headache, a stiff neck, a rash, nausea or vomiting.
The symptoms can appear two to 10 days 
after exposure, according to the Florida De-partment of Health, and usually occur within ﬁ  ve days.
To prevent contracting the disease, vaccines 
are available, and routine hygiene procedures 
are recommended by the department.Student diagnosed with meningitisSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 16

They raised $8,000 between the community and the Florida DOT  
mural booth. “I think that’s a really 
cool idea of: We are all just here.”
As the morning progressed, 
more kids and parents drew their outlines onto the road, perhaps the 
most accurate illustration of the 
event’s central theme: The streets belong to us all.
The culmination of five weeks of 
planning and months of delibera-tion, Open Streets was a joint ven-ture hosted by the Florida Depart-ment of Transportation, the City of Gainesville, Gainesville Citizens for 
Active Transportation and GetAc-
tiveGNV.
Co-organizer Shawn Webber 
started developing the idea in the spring with Gainesville Citizens for Active Transportation. He based Open Streets off the concept of Ciclovia, a series of worldwide events that promote alternative 
uses for roadways.
The Florida Department of 
Transportation was also looking 
for Florida cities to host Ciclovia, and co-organizer Joseph Floyd, with GetActiveGNV, responded. Gainesville was chosen as the host for North Florida District 2.
The groups met to begin the 
planning of the event, but they were short on the initial $8,000 needed to fund it. Several businesses and organizations around Gainesville heard about the event through word-of-mouth and began to offer their support through donations of money and facilities.
In little more than a month, the 
community’s rallying raised $8,000, the Department of Transportation contributed $3,000, and hundreds of people joined the event on Face-book.
“It says the community is ready 
for it, they’re hungry for it, and they 
want to see more of it,” Floyd said. 
“I think it’s a sense of community and a sense of place, and it’s a slow-er pace of life that actually allows us to appreciate the things and the people around us.”
By Sunday, 1,400 people said 
they would attend the event.
Others, like skateboarder Dante 
DeBose, just stumbled into it.
DeBose, 24, skated up after work 
to see why the road was closed.
By 2 p.m., he was clearing the 
bike limbo pole at a booth hosted by the all-girl bike group Velo Vixens. DeBose jumped over the three-foot stick and landed on his skateboard as the crowd cheered him on.
“We skate in the street and get 
kicked out or grab on cars and al-ways get kicked out,” DeBose said. “We are not getting kicked out this 
time. It’s surreal.”
Local businesses, too, were tak-
ing advantage of the open concept.
Sweet Mel’s, on the corner 
of University Avenue and Main Street, was grilling hot dogs on the 
sidewalk. Two large tables were set out on the street for patrons to or-der off the menu.
“We don’t serve outside because 
we are right at the light, because of 
the fumes from the vehicles,” said 
co-owner Mel Crawford. “But with-out the vehicles here, it’s definitely giving us an added opportunity.”
Her husband and fellow co-
owner Pat Crawford agreed from behind the grill.
“It seems like with Gainesville, 
people turn out. I didn’t have a 
doubt, I just had a doubt at 11 
o’clock, and then all of a sudden, everyone started showing up,” he said.
A sense of community filled the 
roadway as people stopped to greet each other and met for the first time, thanks to tangled dog leash-es. Roller derby teammates skated 
down the street as locals admired 
each other’s artwork on the grow-ing chalk mural.
“I heart Gainesville” joined the 
drawings. Below it, Bina Patel’s 8-year-old son, Akshay, one-upped the phrase with “I heart the U.S.A.” and an American flag. In the center of the intersection someone wrote, 
“Bikes are the solution” in salmon-
colored chalk.
Floyd watched in awe  Sun-
day afternoon as a crowd formed around local folk band Michael Claytor and His Friends, perform-ing on a stage held up by two bike trailers.
“The one thing that I’m just en-
amored by is everyone you look at is smiling,” he said. “It can’t get any better than that.”

Catherine Kennedy never picked 
up a paintbrush until she experi-
enced a nervous breakdown from overworking in 1980.
She would paint sporadically 
until her daughter’s death in 2009, when Kennedy came to terms with her mental illness.
Though she suffered, her art 
blossomed. The 3-D mane of “Moth-er Nature,” a concoction of paint, jewels and dried magnolia leaves, contrasted “Father Time,” a dark de-piction of the man in the moon with 
the rough texture of bark bathed in 
metallic silver paint.
The texture and color of both 
pieces have morphed over the past five years, evolving with Kennedy’s emotional growth.
“No one wanted to hear my woes,” she said.
Kennedy, a 67-year-old from 
Alachua, showcased her work at Re-framing Recovery, an exhibit hosted by the Gainesville Opportunity Center on Saturday, featuring artists 
battling mental illnesses who use art 
in their recovery. While visitors pe-rused art on sheet walls framed with white string lights, poets recited free verse, and musicians took the stage in a donated space inside Cymplify at 5402 NW Eighth Ave. 
Kennedy joined Gainesville Op-
portunity Center as a cook shortly 
after her daughter’s death. 
“It’s not so much medication as 
it was actions, like speaking about 
what happened to me,” she said.
The event’s volunteer organizer, 
Maggie Hannon, a recreational ther-apist with UF Health Shands Hos-pital, created the exhibit not only to display the talent of Gainesville Opportunity Center’s members, but also to raise awareness about the social stigma of mental illness. She asked each artist to type an explana-tion behind what inspired his or her 
art and give visitors insight on the 
struggle with mental illness.
“We wanted to show that people 
who have mental illness are part of all of us,” Hannon said.
Pam Demers, executive director 
of Gainesville Opportunity Center, said the center uses a “clubhouse model” to help its 104 members 
recover from mental illness. Each 
member holds a day-to-day task to keep the center functioning, from writing grants to washing dishes.
“To see people who are express-
ing themselves in a way that’s so beautiful, it’s spectacular,” Demers said. “It’s neat.” 4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2014

Tampa and Jacksonville are two of the 
most accommodating cities for individuals 
with disabilities, according to a study pub-
lished this month.
Both Tampa and Jacksonville ranked in 
WalletHub.com’s top 50 best places for in-
dividuals with disabilities to live.
 The study analyzed 150 of the most 
populated American cities both best and worst suited for living with disabilities in observance of National Disability Employ-ment Awareness Month.
Ten cities in Florida made the list. Tam-
pa ranked eighth, while Jacksonville came in at No. 49. 
Gainesville did not make the list.Getting around Gainesville is not easy 
for the physically disabled, said Nancy Burns, a 67-year-old retired secretary. Her last place of employment was Em-
erson Alumni Hall, where she worked for the UF Alumni Association for about 15 years. 
Burns said she’s been disabled since 
2001, when she lost her leg to blood clots that wouldn’t stop producing.
She said Gainesville would benefit from 
more transportation services, like UF’s Gator Lift Service.  
UF is continuing to create better acces-
sibility for individuals with disabilities. Last month, the school broke ground on Cypress Hall — UF’s 25th residence hall 
— and housing was designed specifically 
with the physically disabled in mind. 
The dorms will have 255 bed spaces, 35 
of which will be available to students with higher levels of physical disability, featur-
ing lift systems to transport them through 
their rooms.
One reason Tampa did so well in this study, according to Jill Gonzalez, spokes-woman at WalletHub, was its doctor costs. 
The city had the ninth-best ranking, at 
about $80 per visit last year.
“Jacksonville actually came in first at 
$67, and Madison (Wisconsin) came in last at $182,” Gonzalez said. 
“So that can kind of put it in perspec-
tive for you.”
Gonzalez said Tampa ranked seventh in 
number of hotels with wheelchair access.
Overland Park, Kansas, was ranked 
No. 1 and Providence, Rhode Island, was 
ranked No. 150.
Miami ranked No. 148, as Gonzalez 
said about half of its disabled population 
lives in poverty.
“It’s something that they should really 
work on,” she said.Gainesville doesn’t make list of  best accomodating cities

LinkedIn has added itself to 
the toppling tower of univer-
sity rankings, and UF didn’t make the cut.
The social media site used 
more than 300 million users to rank universities based on the career outcomes of graduates, according to a post on Linke-dIn’s official blog.
The rankings included the 
top 25 schools in eight profes-sional areas, including account-ing, design, marketing and in-
vestment banking. 
“I was shocked when I no-
ticed UF didn’t place in the top 
for any industry,” said Kelvin M. Medina, a UF advertising senior. “I’m very confident in our ability, education and cred-ibility.”
Medina, like other users, 
uses the professional network to look for jobs and create a pro-file to attract companies.
“It opens up the world of 
professionalism,” the 21-year-old said.
To create the rankings, 
LinkedIn identified companies 
that best attracted and retained 
employees, according to the blog post. 
The company then looked 
at users who graduated in the last eight years and worked in a particular career.
For each university and pro-
fession, LinkedIn calculated the percentage of graduates who have desirable jobs. These re-sults ranked the universities based on the career outcomes of graduates, according to the post.
“As the professional world 
evolves, we are continually 
looking to provide univer-
sity rankings for an increas-ingly broad spectrum of career paths,” said Navneet Kapur on LinkedIn’s official blog.
The only Florida schools to 
place in the rankings are the University of Miami, No. 17 in media professionals, and Ring-
ling College of Art and Design, 
No. 7 in designers. 
“I think it’s very interesting 
and just another way to mea-sure,” said Lisa Buyer, the au-thor of “Social PR Secrets” and a UF public relations adjunct professor. 
“It’s a combination of peo-
ple’s choice and showing how social media can influence scor-ing, whether its restaurants or universities.”
Combining social media and 
data, the rankings are a part of LinkedIn’s mission for students to make better decisions based for their career paths. 
According to another blog 
post on LinkedIn’s official blog, the company also has decision boards and a university finder where students discover ca-reers and schools that best fit their interests.
“I definitely think this is a 
smart direction for LinkedIn 
and that it’s part of a bigger pic-
ture,” Buyer said. “It’s just the beginning.”UF not included in

Revisions made to a federal sexu-
al assault act will now include LGBT 
students. But for some people in UF community, the act is not enough.
The Campus Sexual Violence 
Elimination Act, known as the Cam-pus SaVE Act, focuses on how cam-puses report sexual crimes.
Chris Loschiavo, UF associate 
dean for student affairs and the di-rector of student conduct and con-flict resolution, said that the law is amending the Clery Act from 2011 that required colleges to report 
crimes that happen on campus but wasn’t specific in cases of sexual as-
sault and how to deal with them. 
“Not having clear definitions 
makes that a problem for campus-es,”  he said. 
The act changes the qualifica-
tions of sexual assault for students from being between a man and  a woman to being gender neutral. Lo-
schiavo said this will hopefully help 
students who have been attacked in LGBTQ+ relationships to feel more comfortable coming forward and telling their stories. 
LB Hannahs, the UF director of 
LGBTQ+ affairs, helped make sug-gestions for the legislation through the National Coalition of Anti-Vi-olence Programs. These new rules might help break down the myth of sexual violence being strictly man-on-woman, Hannahs said.
In Florida, religious groups are 
protected from discrimination, but sexual orientation is not. Hannahs said the new act, which went into effect Wednesday, requires UF to report all cases of violence, which is the closest sexual orientation has ever been to being federally pro-tected.
UF is a safe place for the LGBTQ+ 
community because of its non-dis-criminatory policies, Hannahs said. However, LGBTQ+ communities on other campuses in the state and country may not feel the same.
Hannahs said it’s not about 
what’s in the new law but what’s missing. Because the law is not spe-cific, other campuses could interpret it any way they like.
“The issue is not black and 
white,” Hannahs said. “It’s super gray and super complicated.”
Naomi Phineas, a victim advo-
cate at University Police, said that the university has many avenues for handling cases of sexual assault. When students go to the victim ad-vocacy office, they enter a confiden-tial agreement where they can get the support they need without im-mediately launching an investiga-tion. Once it’s reported to the dean, an investigation will follow, even if 
the victim wishes to stay out of it.
Most victims, no matter their ori-
entation, are hesitant to report an at-
tack because it often happens within social circles where the victim might feel judged by peers, Phineas said. 
“People are reluctant to report, 
but they still need help.”

Tatiana Kelly stood shyly next to her older sister 
and a friend at a peace rally Sunday.
The 13-year-old said she was bullied for about a 
year at a private school in Gainesville.
“It was depressing,” she said. “I don’t want other 
people to go through (what I did),” Kelly said, her 
voice fading and eyes staring at the ground.
More than 100 people and several peace organiza-
tions came together at the March & Rally for Peace at about 5 p.m. to raise awareness on bullying within the community.
The event kicked off with a downtown march start-
ing at the Hippodrome State Theater. Musical guests performed at the event, which was hosted by the River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding. Bears & Lions led the march, chanting “Peace, love, more compassion.”
The band, dressed in bear and lion costumes, was 
mostly popular with young participants, while Be More Heroic, Joie Kathos and Dani Shay’s music appealed to teenagers and young adults with deeper messages.
Rachel Wayne, 28, held a sign that read “Words Do 
Hurt Me.”
“People say, ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me,” but words do hurt, said Wayne, a UF anthropology student who was a victim of bullying and domestic abuse.
She wore clothes with words like “crazy” and 
“nerd” sewn on them. Wayne said her outfit repre-sented the abusive things her ex-boyfriend and others called her. When she took the clothes off later, Wayne said it would be a symbolic way of saying they no lon-ger define her.
While most people at the rally believed bullying is 
bad, Richard Welch felt differently.
“I think bullying is a good thing,” said Welch, a 19-
year-old dual-enrollment engineering student at Santa Fe College, adding that he believes bullying in mod-eration can build character and help victims grow up more quickly.
“Some people overreact to bullying,” he said. And 
when it comes to cyberbullying, he said, “just turn off the computer and go outside and play.”Downtown rally sheds light on bullying� OFFICERS SAY HE

A former UF student, who 
officers said manufactured psy-
chedelic mushrooms with the intent to sell, was apprehended by U.S. Marshals on Thursday.
Marshals found and ar-
rested Fernando Eyzaguirre on an outstanding drug warrant in Denver Thursday night, ac-cording to a press release.
He was booked into the Den-
ver County Jail on his pending arrest warrant.
Eyzaguirre attended UF in 
Spring 2013 and Spring 2014, the release said.
The 28-year-old and his co-defendant, Antonio Bejerano, are accused of conspiring to manufacture and distribute psychedelic mushrooms in Gainesville between May and August of last year.
The men will face federal 
charges.
Ezyaguirre also faces charg-
es of possession with intent to sell marijuana. Bejerano now faces charges of possession of a firearm for his Ruger .380-cali-ber pistol in relation to the drug trafficking crime, according to the release.
“Our agency’s task forces, 
technology, and investigative expertise will continue to lead to the apprehension of fugitives such as Eyzaguirre,” U.S. Mar-shal Ed Spooner of the North-ern District of Florida said in the press release. US Marshals seize

ORLANDO — A longtime 
endurance runner and peace 
activist whose latest goal was to reach Bermuda in a homemade floating “Hydro Pod” was res-
cued by the U.S. Coast Guard 
on Saturday after he began suf-fering from fatigue.
Coast Guard air crew were 
able to safely pick up Reza Ba-luchi and the bubble Saturday morning, Coast Guard spokes-woman Marilyn Fajardo said in a statement. He was trans-
ported to a nearby Coast Guard 
station and was found to be un-injured, Fajardo said.A statement on Baluchi’s 
website said the Iranian exile had planned to make the 1,033-
mile trip in his self-designed 
bubble to raise money “for chil-dren in need” and “to ... inspire those that have lost hope for a better future.”
The “Hydro Pod” is a large 
bubble made of 3-mm-thick plastic, Baluchi’s website, “Run With Reza,” said. 
According to the site, Ba-
luchi planned to run in the bubble in the mornings, cool off in the sea while leashed to the floating sphere and sleep in a hammock inside it at night. In addition to protein bars, the Coast Guard said it found in his bubble, he planned to catch and 
eat fish, the site said.Man in floating bubble

As children, we aren’t given a choice of where we 
grow up, who our parents are or what kind of standard of living we get to enjoy. 
All of those decisions are determined by our parents or 
simply by fate.
Unfortunately, not all children are born into a loving 
family with dedicated parents who make enough income to give their children a decent upbringing.
Sometimes, children are born into a broken home 
with detached parents, poor living conditions, unsuit-able neighborhoods that pressure impressionable minds into making poor life choices and many other horrendous things that no child should have to experience.
However, every child eventually reaches a certain level 
of maturity and understanding that enables him or her to aspire to something better.
Here at UF and at universities all over the country, it is 
our responsibility as future leaders to ensure that genera-tions after us are given the tools and opportunities they need to better their situations. Organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs of America are doing this every day.
The mission of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America is 
“to enable all young people, especially those who need us most, to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.” This mission should be shared by everyone at UF and across the nation who cares about the well-being and futures of younger generations. The work of the Boys & Girls Clubs proves that if you foster and mentor children, especially those who may not receive the attention they deserve at home, they will succeed.
Every year, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America name its 
National Youth of the Year. This year, that title belongs to Maryah Sullivan.
Sullivan grew up in Orlando and was a member of the 
Boys & Girls Clubs of Central Florida. She recently gradu-ated with a 4.4 GPA from Edgewater High School.
Sullivan is now a freshman at the University of South Florida and is the first in her fam-ily to attend college. Her future is bright, but it wasn’t always that way.
Upon receiving her honor as 
Youth of the Year, Sullivan gave a speech that perfectly summed up what opportunity is all about.
 She said, “I witnessed broken doors and glass win-
dows because the police kicked the doors down. I knew how it felt to be forced to move from my home because my stepfather was charged with a felony.”
 She obviously grew up in less than desirable settings, 
but she went on to say, “I’ve been through a lot in my life, but I would never allow any of my circumstances to stop me.”
That is a message we should all remember and should 
be passed down to children who feel that the world is un-fair, that they don’t have a place or that their lives have no value. 
Our goal should be to not allow the circumstances of 
today to determine who we become tomorrow.
I  believe as Americans, we have unique opportunities 
to improve ourselves. 
In this country, if you do not like the situation you are 
in today, you have the ability to change it over time.
Some people may disagree and blame their circum-
stances on prejudice, misguided government policies or any number of other barriers. 
At the end of the day, the decision to improve ourselves 
is a decision that only we can make.
Yes, some things are out of our control, especially as 
children. 
However, people like Maryah are proving that if you 
want to be better and are given the right opportunities, nothing is impossible.

flu shot this year?Today’s question: Are you worried about catching 
meningococcal meningitis?Rick Scott’s shady 
personal finances 
reflect behavior
The Sunshine Amendment, which was added to the Florida Constitution in 1976, requires all state elected officials to make a “full and public disclosure” of their 
financial holdings every year.
In 2013, the Florida Legislature passed a law allowing law-
makers to use “blind trusts,” rather than filing a public report 
of their finances. The idea behind a blind trust is to prevent the owner from having any input in decisions made about the wealth that the trust contains.
Since the law was passed, only one politician has taken ad-
vantage of it: Gov. Rick Scott, by far the wealthiest governor in Florida history.
Rather than disclosing all his assets and financial transactions 
to the public, Scott opted to take the blind trust route.The blind trust, at least hypothetically, would ensure that Scott would not knowingly benefit financially from any government actions dur-ing his time in office.
However, a recent investigation and report by the Miami 
Herald and Tampa Bay Times suggest Scott’s trust may not have been so blind after all. Scott’s financial records, which the two papers reviewed extensively, are riddled with inconsistencies 
and missing information.
The governor failed to disclose the true value of 17 assets in 
eight different trust accounts that list him as an owner or part-
ner. The financial information Scott provided on state disclosure forms also differed significantly from the reports he filed with the Federal Election Commission and the IRS.
Most notably, the partnerships and trusts owned by Scott’s 
family and operated by his financial advisers often act with the the same goals as the “blind trust,” which suggests the governor 
may have been involved in the decisions made regarding the 
trust.
Unfortunately, Scott’s lack of financial transparency seems to 
be an essential feature of his character. It bears repeating that be-fore being elected as Florida governor, Scott ran a company that was a party to the largest Medicare fraud settlement in history. It is no surprise that Scott’s dishonest and shadowy financial deal-ings extend into his personal and political life.
Scott’s opponent in his re-election bid, Democratic nominee 
Charlie Crist, has not been the paragon of financial transparency during this campaign either. Crist has steadfastly refused to re-lease his wife’s tax returns. For all his shortcomings in the area of financial transparency, even Scott has released his spouse’s financial records.
However, Crist has a record of financial disclosure and trans-
parency from his tenure as Florida governor. Scott’s record, both in and out of office, is one of obfuscation and opacity.
The disastrous policies Scott has enacted during his time as 
governor would ideally deny him another term. 
Florida voters deserve to know whether their elected officials 
are benefitting financially from policy decisions, and Scott has made every effort to hide this knowledge from them.

The subject of race relations is still a very sensitive 
issue in the U.S. Anyone believing that we live in a post-racist society should take note of the case in-
volving Jennifer Crambelett and Amanda Zinkon.
Cramblett and Zinkon, a same-sex couple in Ohio, 
used a donation from a sperm bank to conceive a child. The white mothers were surprised, however, when their daughter, Payton, was born in 2012 and displayed a skin tone that was “obviously mixed-race.” 
Cramblett and Zinkon had chosen a white man’s pro-
ﬁ  le to father their baby but were shipped vials from an African-American donor. The child is now 2 years old, and her mothers are suing Midwest Sperm Bank for the establishment’s negligence, citing economic and emotion-al losses.
According to the lawsuit, the mothers live “each day 
with fears, anxieties and uncertainty” about their fam-ily’s future. Apparently, they are less worried about the hardships their daughter will face in life as a member of American society because she has two moms and are more worried about the toll that being black will have on shap-ing her life.
I don’t mean to imply that racial concerns are more 
signiﬁ  cant than issues of sexual orientation. However, it is important to understand and explore the role that race played in this situation.
There is no doubt in my mind that Cramblett and 
Zinkon will win their case against Midwest. Legally, the sperm bank was negligent by failing to provide the couple with its contractually agreed-upon service. The company will likely soon switch from handwritten records to elec-tronic ones to prevent a mistake like this from happening again.
However, the forces at play here have implications be-
yond this one incident.
Race is a crucial and indicative marker of the life you 
will lead in the U.S. Despite claims that we entered a post-racist society following the election of President Barack Obama, institutional racism is still ubiquitous in America.
Because of how unwelcoming Cramblett and Zinkon’s 
all-white neighborhood has been to their biracial daugh-ter, therapists have advised the family to move to a more racially diverse community for their own safety and well-being.
Now that two white mothers have been negatively af-
fected by racial intolerance, the media listen and express sympathy.People of color have been 
voicing their unhappiness with racial intolerance and the detri-mental effects that it has on their well-being and safety in Ameri-ca for centuries. Unfortunately, they are often accused of having misguided victim complexes and are berated for “playing the race card.”
If we want to talk about misguided victim complexes, 
let’s analyze the case before us. Cramblett and Zinkon have expressed emotional distress at their shattered expectation of having a fully white daughter rather than a mixed-race or black child. The mothers have also expressed discom-fort at having to travel to black communities to have their daughter’s hair properly cared for.
The lawsuit states that the parents don’t want Payton 
“to feel stigmatized or unrecognized due simply to the cir-cumstances of her birth.” However, none of their actions since her birth support this claim. Instead of learning how to do their daughter’s hair, they’re suing because non-white hair is now something they have to deal with.
This suit serves to highlight just how pervasive, ugly 
and damaging the stigmas applied to non-white Ameri-cans are. The ugly truth of our society is that race still mat-ters. Speciﬁ  cally, it matters to a lot of people whether you belong to the “right” race.
If we want to advance as a society, we have to begin 
rethinking about how we view race. We should not fool ourselves into believing our society is post-racist or col-orblind. It isn’t. What we should be doing instead is em-bracing all the differences that come with racial diversity and understand that these differences should be acknowl-edged and valued, not ignored or disparaged.
Payton has the misfortune of growing up knowing 
that her parents viewed her race as a burden on their lives as white women. People of color have the misfortune of growing up knowing that white-dominated American so-ciety views its race as a burden.
If we want to truly become a post-racist society, we 
have to ﬁ  rst stop devaluing those who are nonwhite or partly nonwhite. Once we learn how to do that, we can start to appreciate the beauty of America’s racial and eth-nic diversity.

The race card is played for a reasonColumn
As someone who cares deeply about peace, jus-
tice and human rights in the Middle East, I am very concerned about recent events on cam-
pus promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions 
Movement (BDS) against Israel.
Although BDS brands it-
self as a nonviolent “social 
movement” promoting human 
rights, it spreads propaganda 
with the aim of ending Israel’s 
existence as the democratic state of the Jewish people.
Self-determination is a universal human right. By at-
tempting to undermine Jewish self-determination, BDS is promoting a fundamentally discriminatory, anti-
peace agenda. 
If we allow the movement to continue unchallenged, 
this movement will harm our community in the service 
of an unjust cause. BDS deserves our condemnation as UF students, not our complicity or respect.
BDS threatens what hope remains for peace between 
Palestinians and Israelis. 
Leading BDS activists have made their purpose clear 
in their public statements.
According to As’ad Abukhalil, a political science 
professor at California State University, Stanislaus, “the real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel.”
Similarly, Omar Barghouti, the founding committee 
member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, stated unequivocally 
that “we (supporters of BDS) oppose a Jewish state in 
any part of Palestine.”
Ahmed Moor, a Palestinian-American political com-
mentator, said, “BDS does mean the end of the Jewish state.”
BDS supporters chant “From the river to the sea, 
Palestine will be free.” 
The extremism of this slogan reveals there is no de-
sire for peace and unity.
The “river” the slogan refers to is the Jordan River, 
and the “sea” is the Mediterranean Sea. Israel sits be-tween these bodies of water.
Supporters of BDS are not interested in a peaceful 
coexistence between an Israeli state and a Palestinian 
state. Instead, they seek the replacement of Israel with 
a single, Arab-majority  Palestinian state.
The movement singles out Israel, the only democ-
racy in the Middle East, as it simultaneously disregards the world’s worst human rights violators, including the 
terrorist organization Hamas.
BDS has been widely condemned for pushing boy-
cotts of Israeli academia, including by our administra-tion and Student Government because such actions 
threaten academic freedom and constitute discrimina-
tion based on national origin. 
Contributing to the BDS movement in any way 
violates the most basic principles of our university — equal rights, social justice, academic freedom and the 
free exchange of ideas.
Whether they intend to, those who support BDS are 
undermining academic freedom on campus and dam-aging efforts to bring peace in the Middle East.  
We should encourage both sides to make hard 
choices in negotiations, rather than pushing for Israel’s elimination. 
We should uphold justice and human rights for all, 
rather than promoting one side at the expense of the other.
As UF students, we should stand up to the BDS 
movement’s hate and work toward a future of mutual 
recognition and mutual respect between Israelis, Pales-
tinians and all people in the Middle East.

Visitors browsed native plants 
on sale, admired pollinators and 
participated in a festival that took place on the front lawn of the Flori-da Museum of Natural History this 
weekend to celebrate butterflies.
The museum hosted its ninth an-
nual ButterflyFest. The free festival 
hosted games, middle school bands, jugglers and a plant sale. The three-day festival educated visitors about biodiversity and the butterflies’ im-pact on the environment.
More than 3,000 visitors attend-
ed the weekend festival.
“Biodiversity is not only the vari-ety of life on Earth but also the basis of our life support system,” wrote Katina Prokos, a marketing assis-tant for the museum, in an email. “Butterflies are incredibly sensitive to changes in the environment and therefore are great indicators of the condition of an ecosystem.”
From Friday to Sunday, the mu-
seum sold more than 1,000 plants and displayed about 150 plant spe-cies.
Alice Shinkos, a resident of Jack-
sonville, Florida, visited the plant sale for the first time Saturday.
“What I wanted was the native 
plants and whatever was good for 
the butterflies and pollinators and 
the honeybees,” Shinkos, 62,  said. “So this is an awesome sale.”
Pat Williams, a four-time festival volunteer, said that on average, she sold about eight to 10 plants to each person. One of the most popular plants was the blazing star, a lanky magenta flower.
“They love that one because it is 
so spectacular looking,” Williams, 68, said. “So that, I think, is a show-
stopper.”
The festival also included a Polli-
nator Parade where visitors dressed 
up as bees, butterflies, bats or birds and pledged to protect nature. At the end of the day, visitors watched museum employees release native Florida butterflies.
“Butterflies are bioindicators,” 
said Catherine Carey, the Florida Museum program coordinator. “Anything that impacts their lives eventually impacts us.”

PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Jean-Claude 
Duvalier, who presided over what was widely 
acknowledged as a corrupt and brutal regime as the self-proclaimed “president for life” of Haiti until a popular uprising sent him into a 
25-year exile, has died. He was 63.
Duvalier died Saturday from a heart at-
tack at the home of a friend in Port-au-Prince 
where he had been staying, said his lawyer, Reynold Georges, and several officials in the impoverished nation.
The former leader, 
known as “Baby Doc,” made a surprise return to 
Haiti in 2011, allowing vic-
tims of his regime to pursue 
legal claims against him in Haitian courts and prompt-ing some old allies to rally around him. Neither side 
gained much traction, however, and a frail Duvalier spent his final years quietly in the leafy hills above the Haitian capital.
Haitian President Michel Martelly ex-
pressed his condolences to the former dictator’s family, making no mention of the widespread 
human rights abuse that occurred under Du-
valier and his more notorious predecessor and father, Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier.
“On behalf of the entire government and 
people of Haiti, I take this sad occasion to ex-tend my sincere sympathies to his family, his relatives and his supporters across the coun-try,” Martelly said.The elder Duvalier was a medical doctor-
turned-dictator who promoted “Noirisme,” a movement that sought to highlight Haiti’s Af-rican roots over its European ones while unit-
ing the black majority against the mulatto elite 
in a country divided by class and color.
“Papa Doc” tortured and killed political 
opponents, relying on a dreaded civilian mili-tia known as the Tonton Macoutes.
Duvalier and his wife, Michele, had two 
children, son Francois Nicolas “Nico” and daughter Anya.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2014

NEW YORK — The first compre-
hensive archive of theater materials 
related to the Holocaust has been es-tablished at the University of Miami, allowing researchers and students worldwide access to such plays as Arthur Millers’ “Broken Glass” and 
the stage adaptation of “The Diary 
of Anne Frank.”
The digital Holocaust Theater Ar-
chive includes more than 550 titles and will continue to grow, includ-ing details like synopses, country of origin, casts and rights holders.The archive is the work of the 
Sue and Leonard Miller Center for Contemporary Judaic Studies and 
the George Feldenkreis Program in 
Judaic Studies. The official launch is set for Tuesday.
“Although theater has played an 
extraordinary role from the 1930s to today in Holocaust awareness and education, there has not been until now a comprehensive theater ini-tiative that has sought to make un-derstood that body of work to Holo-
caust educators, officials, theatrical 
companies and the general public,” Arnold Mittelman, the president of the National Jewish Theater Foun-dation and project director of the archive, said in a statement.
The archive includes “The Sub-stance of Fire” by Jon Robin Baitz, several plays by Bertolt Brecht in-cluding “The Resistible Rise of Ar-
turo Ui,” Jeff Cohen’s “The Soap 
Myth” and “The Sound of Music.” The site organizes the works by title and authors, as well as categories, including such common subjects as the ghettos, the extermination camps and Holocaust deniers.

CAIRO — An Internet video re-
leased Friday purports to show an 
Islamic State group fighter behead-ing British hostage Alan Henning, the fourth such killing carried out by 
the extremist group now targeted in 
U.S.-led airstrikes.
The video mirrored other be-
heading videos shot by the Islamic State group, which now holds ter-ritory along the border of Syria and Iraq and ended with a militant threatening a man they identified as an American named Peter Kassig.
“Obama, you have started your aerial bombardment of Sham (Syria), which keeps on striking our people, so it is only right that we continue to strike the necks of your people,” the 
masked militant in the video said.
National Security Council 
Spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden con-
firmed that Kassig was held by Is-lamic State militants.
“At this point we have no rea-
son to doubt the authenticity of the video released earlier today. We will continue to use every tool at our dis-
posal — military, diplomatic, law 
enforcement and intelligence — to try to bring Peter home to his fam-ily,” Hayden said in a statement Fri-day night.
The Associated Press could not 
immediately verify the video’s au-thenticity, though it was released in 
the same manner as other Islamic 
State group videos, and the masked militant sounded similar to the one who carried out the other slayings.
In a statement, the British Foreign 
Office said it was working to verify the video.
“If true, this is a further disgust-
ing murder,” the statement read. 
“We are offering the family every 
support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time.”Video: ISIS beheads British hostage,

UF students willing to fast 
from sunrise to sunset Thurs-
day will be rewarded with a 
feast.
Islam on Campus, the 
student-based Islamic orga-
nization, will host its biggest 
event, Fast-A-Thon, at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Doors open at 6 p.m.
This year will be the 
12th annual Fast-A-Thon, 
and about 800 to 900 people 
are expected to occupy the O’Connell Center, said Sohaib Ahmad, president of Islam on 
Campus.
After a long day of fasting, 
attendees can feast with food 
catered by Golden Dynasty of 
Orlando.
Fast-A-Thon gives mem-
bers of Islam on Campus and 
UF students the opportunity to donate money to charity groups that assist communi-ties worldwide.
Ahmad, a UF biology se-
nior, said Islam on Campus chose Islamic Relief USA and, local women’s empowerment nonprofit, Radiant Hands, to receive this year’s donations.
Fast-A-Thon is based 
around the Islamic practice of fasting, where people eat and drink before the sun rises and abstain from all food and liq-uids until the sun sets.
“Fast-A-Thon encourages 
a powerful state of being,” Zachary Pindar, a 20-year-old UF health science junior said. “It heightens your senses 
and teaches you how to fight 
temptation.”
Terje Ostebo, an assistant 
religion professor at UF, has 
attended Islam on Campus 
meetings.
“This organization caters 
to the community, and it is 
striving to create network that houses a brotherhood and sis-
terhood for young Muslims,” 
Ostebo said.
Nazmi Ahmed, a UF sus-
tainability studies junior, said 
Islam on Campus provides 
her with a sense of belonging 
and has brought her closer to 
her Islamic faith.
“I attended one event out 
of curiosity, and the members 
made me feel a sense of genu-
ine hospitality and commu-
nity,” Ahmed, 20, said.
Ahmad, 22, said he has

HONG KONG — Hong Kong’s 
pro-democracy activists agreed Sun-
day to remove some barriers block-ing roads and sidewalks ahead of the government’s deadline to scale 
back their protests.
But the demonstrators appeared 
to be divided, and others refused to 
budge with only hours to go.An alliance of students said it 
had tried but so far failed to reach agreement with officials on a plan to begin talks on their demands for 
wider political reforms.
The group vowed to continue 
protests until details of the talks 
might be worked out.
“If the government uses force to 
clear away protesters, there will be no room for dialogue,” Lester Shum, one of the group’s leaders, told re-porters.
Earlier in the day, students oc-
cupying the area just outside city government headquarters agreed to 
remove some barricades that were 
blocking the building’s entrance af-ter the government said it would do whatever was necessary to ensure 3,000 civil servants would have full access to their offices on Monday.
The partial withdrawal appeared 
to be part of a strategy to regroup in another part of town, as protesters were urged to shift from other areas to Hong Kong’s Admiralty shopping and business district, a central loca-
tion near the government’s main of-
fices that has served as an informal headquarters for the protests.
Alex Chow, another student 
leader, said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling as peo-ple prepared to return to work and school on Monday.Officials said they intended to 
have key streets open for schools and offices by Monday morning, but it was unclear whether they would 
act to clear the streets and other ar-
eas by force or just settle for a partial victory in clearing some roads.
The government announced a re-
opening of schools and some roads but indicated some disruptions were likely to continue.

TOKYO  — A powerful typhoon lashed 
southern Japan on Sunday, churning up 
high waves that washed three American air-men out to sea and killed at least one before taking aim at Tokyo.
Elsewhere in the Pacific, a separate ty-
phoon whipped the Mariana Islands, includ-ing Guam, with high winds and heavy rain.
By late Sunday, Typhoon Phanfone was 
off the coast of Shikoku in southwestern Ja-pan, with winds of up to 144 kilometers per hour after hitting the regions of Okinawa and Kyushu, Japan’s Meteorological Agency said.
One of the three airmen was found dead. 
The other two were missing, according to the Air Force and the Japanese coast guard.
They had been on Okinawa island’s 
northern coast when they were overcome by the waves, according to Tsuguyoshi Miyagi of the coast guard’s Okinawa branch.
The Air Force said the search for the missing airmen had been interrupted by rough seas. Their names were being with-held pending notification of relatives.
Okinawa is home to about half of the 
roughly 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.
Several people on Kyushu island were 
injured in the typhoon. The storm also grounded more than 100 flights Sunday and knocked out power to more than 9,500 Ky-ushu homes.
Typhoon Vongfong had maximum sus-tained winds estimated at 105 mph, said Roger Edson of the National Weather Ser-vice in Guam.
Winds on the islands of Guam, Tinian, 
and Saipan were gusting to at least 55 mph, he said.
Residents on Guam heeded warnings 
about high winds and possible flooding by taking shelter at designated public schools. The island government and many business-es were expected to be closed Monday, and most flights were canceled.Hong Kong protesters at odds over pullback plan on deadline

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. – Sports, 
for many fans across the country, 
serve as an outlet when tragedy strikes. 
Fenway Park following the 
Boston Bombing in 2012; Yankee Stadium after September 11th; and Hokie Football on the Satur-day following the Virginia Tech tragedy evoke some of the most powerful and emotional images of when sports serve as a coping mechanism.
Cheering for a beloved team 
along with thousands of people around doing the same can be an escape from the sadness — or at least be one for a few hours.
But sometimes those same 
players that are leaned on to give some hope in times of despair are actually going through tragedies of their own. Ones that we may 
not even know about.
On Saturday afternoon, Flori-
da’s Bryan Cox, Jr. took the ﬁ  eld in Knoxville and started at de-
fensive end in front of more than 100,000 screaming fans. All the while, he was dealing with a per-sonal loss of his own that neither fans nor members of the media were aware of.
Cox’s grandfather Otis Wil-
liams, died earlier in the week. 
Cox went to his grandfather’s 
wake in Atlanta, Ga., on Thursday evening, and attended the funeral on Friday.
“Got back about 10:30 last 
night,” Cox said. “That’s when my ﬂ  ight came in. I went to bed. I woke up and it was game day.”
Roughly 24 hours after going 
to his grandfather’s funeral, Cox played the best game of his Gator career against Tennessee. 
One season after totaling ﬁ  ve 
tackles and two sacks in eight games, Cox recorded ﬁ  ve solo tackles, including three sacks for a loss of 26 total yards against the Volunteers. 
Cox said post game that he 
dedicated Saturday’s game to his belated grandfather.Cox has career game while playing with a heavy heart

Florida added another Southeastern 
Conference win to its belt on Sunday at 
Mississippi State.
In it’s 3-0 sweep of the Bulldogs, the 
Gators (10-3, 4-0 SEC) closed its second weekend of SEC play, but not without a ﬁ  ght.
In Florida’s history, Mississippi 
State has never beat Florida. Sunday’s win was the Gators 44th consecutive win against the Bulldogs and the 35 under coach Mary Wise.
Mississippi State (5-13, 0-3 SEC) 
jumped out to a strong start in the ﬁ  rst set tying Florida in points nine times. 
After Wise called a timeout and 
made a change in game plan, Florida pulled ahead and took the ﬁ  rst set 25-18.
Florida ﬁ  nished its sweep of Mis-
sissippi State in two more sets (25-18, 25-23), but Wise was unhappy with Florida’s defensive performance.Florida’s three senior defensive spe-
cialists had a rough day. Holly Pole, Florida’s libero, ﬁ  nished the match with just 10 digs, two service errors and one service ace. Maddy Monserez 
came behind Pole with nine digs and one service error 
and teammate Taylor Unroe ﬁ  nished with two digs and a match-high four service errors. Florida ﬁ  nished the match with a total of 13 service errors in just three sets.
“Alex (Holston) got a little impa-
tient,” Wise said. “It wasn’t Taylor Un-roe’s best match. … I did not see that Maddy and Holly continue to show their grit and poise. … Sometimes she (Pole) plays as a D.S. instead of a libero, I’d like her to literally push people out of the way to take the ﬁ  rst ball.”
While Florida underperformed on 
the defense, junior middle blocker Si-mone Antwi led the Gators with 11 Florida sweeps Mississippi 
State despite poor defenseAIR JORDAN
KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — I know what you’re thinking Gator fans.
You saw Treon Harris come 
into the game at the end of the 
third quarter against Tennessee in Neyland Stadium, and Flori-da’s offense clicked.
The Gators rallied for the 
10-9 win, and the majority – if not all – of the credit should go to Treon.
Unfortunately, that was not the case this 
weekend.
Even though Treon picked up the Flor-
ida offense and had two successful drives, 
the Gators defense carried them to the win 
over the Volunteers on Saturday.
When Florida threw three interceptions 
in the ﬁ  rst 45 minutes, the defense con-
tained Tennessee. 
The Volunteers scrapped together just 
six points off of the Gators’ turnovers de-
spite starting two of those three drives in-
side the red zone and the other one near 
midﬁ  eld.
The UF defense — a volatile group sus-
ceptible to surrendering explosive plays through its ﬁ  rst two Southeastern Confer-
ence games — shored up the majority of its 
mistakes against the Volunteers on Satur-day.After giving up a combined 
13 pass plays of 25 or more yards against Kentucky and 
Alabama, Florida allowed just 
two in Knoxville.
The 205 yards the Gators re-
linquished to Volunteers quar-
terback Justin Worley were the 
least they have given up since SEC play began this season.
Simply put, the secondary is getting bet-
ter.
True freshman Jalen Tabor, who started 
his ﬁ  rst game at cornerback on Saturday, ex-celled in coverage and on the corner blitz.
With less than 30 seconds remaining 
in the third quarter, Tabor almost single-handedly shifted the momentum into the Gators’ hands by sacking Tennessee quar-terback Justin Worley, forcing a fumble and falling on top of it at the UT 30-yard line.
Florida scored ﬁ  ve plays later thanks to 
the short ﬁ  eld — which was also Treon’s ﬁ  rst drive at the helm of UF’s offense.
Two timely second-half interceptions 
by cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III and safety Keanu Neal erased a Jeff Driskel pick and sealed the game, respectively.
Florida’s run defense also continued its 
dominance, limiting the Volunteers to a Gators defense responsible for win

tacking clip to finish the match. 
The middle blocker had an un-
disclosed injury that kept her from competing in Florida’s loss to Mar-quette on Sept. 19. After about two weeks time out from practice and competing, Antwi made her way back to the court in Florida’s first SEC matches of the season against Auburn on Sept. 26 and Ole Miss on Sept. 28.
“I thought the difference maker 
for tonight was Simone – in terms of both offense and defense,” Wise said. “When she was in the front row, we scored a bunch of points.”
In unusual form, junior setter 
Mackenzie Dagostino also strug-gled in Florida’s win against Mis-sissippi State.
Dagostino finished the day with 
38 assists, one service ace and three service errors. The junior struggled connecting with freshman Rhamat Alhassan, who finished the day with 10 kills on 18 attempts with three attacking errors.
Dagostino’s passes weren’t high 
enough for the 6-foot-4 freshman 
and resulted in Alhassan being un-
able to fully extend her arm when 
attempting to make kills.
“It was a quiet 10 (kills),” Wise 
said. “I think Rhamat, she got a lit-tle impatient and kind of reverted to some of the swings that worked for her in the beginning of her vol-leyball career.”“I definitely was playing 
for him and my family and 
just tried to do the best I could out there,” Cox said.
Cox’s third sack came at 
an opportune time for the Gators. Early in the fourth quarter on second and 3 with Tennessee at midfield and driving, Cox sacked Volun-teers quarterback Justin Wor-ley for a loss of six yards to force a long Tennessee third down. 
Worley could only find 
tight end Ethan Wolfe for three yards on third down to force a Volunteers punt.
Getting the Florida offense 
back on the field allowed quarterback Treon Harris and tailback Matt Jones to drive 49 yards on eight plays to the 
Tennessee 32 yard line.
A successful Austin Har-
din 49-yard field goal put the 
Gators up 10-9 while burning the game clock down to 6:20.
Cox, whose third sack 
helped get the Florida offense back on the field to take the lead – as well as the momen-
tum in the fourth quarter 
– said he didn’t think for a second about the possibility of sitting out in the game in light his grandfather’s death.
“It never crossed my mind 
at all,” Cox said. “I love this 
game and I felt like he want-
ed me to play this game.”
Florida’s defense as a 
whole had an impressive two-week turnaround. After giving up a program-high 672 total yards to Alabama in Week 4, it held the Tennessee rushing attack – led by Jalen 
Hurd, who came in with 328 
yards through four games – to 28 total yards. Hurd account-ed for 39 of those yards. 
The Gators’ Southeastern 
Conference Eastern Division title hopes are still very much alive as they prepare for LSU this week. With games 
against LSU, Missouri, Geor-
gia and South Carolina still looming, the Gators are cur-rently tied for second place with Georgia and Kentucky in the Southeastern Confer-ence East standings.
There’s a lot of football left 
to be played, but Cox believes 
the win over Tennessee may 
have provided the spark the Gators need for this season.
“It was very big,” Cox 
said. “This right here was the turning point of the season to me. We have to turn this around. We have to get back 
right. And I think this is a 
good first step.”MONDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida’s defense succeeded on all levels against Tennessee
mere 28 rushing yards on 29 attempts — less than one 
yard per carry.
The Gators are now fourth in the SEC and 15th in the 
nation in rushing yards allowed per game (103.0).
Jarrad Davis and the Florida linebacker corps certain-
ly welcomed Tennessee true freshman Jalen Hurd into the SEC like Davis said they would on Wednesday.
Florida contained him to just 39 rushing yards on 10 
attempts one week after he tallied 119 against Georgia.
The front line made sure Worley did not have time to 
pass the ball, sacking him six times — tying for the most in a single game in the Will Muschamp era of Florida 
football.
And they did it without starter Leon Orr.
I’m not trying to take away from anything Treon 
did against Tennessee. He did what Driskel couldn’t — 
move the offense down the field.
But even with that, his pure numbers (2 of 4 for 17 
yards, 4 rushes for 24 yards) were not anything to brag 
about.
Treon jump-started Florida’s offense before it was too 
late, but the freshman signal caller did not do it alone.
On those two scoring drives, running back Matt Jones 
tallied 42 rushing yards on six attempts — including a 32-yard scamper that put Florida in position to make the 
game-winning field goal.
Even with that, UF’s defense set the pace of the game 
and set up the opportunities for the Gators to pull out


Offensive linemen don’t look 
back. 
When Harris substituted for 
Driskel with eight seconds left in the 
third quarter, the switch went unno-ticed by Florida’s ﬁ  ve up front.
“Until he was in there, really 
in there, I didn’t know (Harris) was back there,” left tackle D.J. Humphries said. “We’re going on a silent (count) so I don’t hear a voice or anything like that.”
Florida’s faithful, identiﬁ  ed by a 
bold blue in a checkered sea of or-ange and white, shared Humphries’ reaction. Although Harris was in-troduced to the crowd as the Gators new quarterback, the announcement went over the heads of many of the fans. Down two possessions — al-beit just nine points — the visiting 
fanbase had been deﬂ  ated, numb, 
tired from their ringside seats at a one-sided boxing match.
But when Harris ﬁ  rst stepped 
back in the pocket, he peaked the crowd’s interest. A forward pass, a rarity for the Gators during the ﬁ  rst three quarters.
It wasn’t a -2 yard hitch or a swing 
pass to the tailback in the backﬁ  eld. No, Harris scanned the coverage, spotted an open Matt Jones 12 yards out and ﬁ  red a bullet in between the numbers. Florida had recorded just one other play through the air that went for 12 or more yards.
The seats in the stands may not have known that stat by the time Harris completed the throw, but they could feel it. They could feel the Gators’ offense stagnating, grinding down to a slow but steady halt.
But things now looked different. 
OK, it was just one play.
Still, there was promise and 
hope from a Florida team that was slumped in the corner, beaten black and blue, just minutes before.
“I deﬁ  nitely felt a spark when 
(Harris) was in,” Jones said. “We got in a rhythm. It was a fresh start. He came in and did what he had to do and we was all just rallying around 
him.”
A once daunting 9-0 deﬁ  cit 
slimmed down to just a two-point 
advantage for the Volunteers after Harris led the Gators to a touchdown on his ﬁ  rst drive of the afternoon.
Just seven minutes later, Florida 
jumped ahead of its SEC East foe for the ﬁ  rst time. No heroics from Har-ris, he was just doing what he had to do — what Driskel failed to do.

“F*** YOU FLORIDA!”Clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.“F*** YOU FLORIDA!”
So goes the sweet sound of vic-
tory.
And despite the language, the 
tone from the UT student section 
was less angry, and more, ‘This is how it’s supposed to go, right?’
Ten years of pain continued 
thanks to a freshman, one who still isn’t allowed to talk to the media.
And then there’s Driskel: the 
one who put up with the reporters through his struggles, the one who spent the spring learning a new playbook while rehabbing a frac-tured leg, the one who was deemed “the one.”
The fairy tales and prayers of him being the next Tim Tebow have long been in the rearview mirror of Gator fans. Now he is ﬁ  ghting to stay relevant.
“I don’t know what the plan is 
from here, but I know coach Mus-champ is going to put the guy out 
there who is going to have the best 
chance for this team,” said Driskel, his voice soft and hurt, but not cracking.
Six-foot-four, 230-pound quarter-
backs don’t let their emotions get the best of them, especially not in front of the cameras. 
No, his answers were simply de-
livered softly, a voice in a cardigan.
Whether Driskel returns to his 
starting role is uncertain. But if he does, Muschamp will undoubtedly have some pieces to pick up, be-cause Driskel exited the matchup with Tennessee the same way he left last year: broken.GRAHAM HACK

Florida avoided a letdown on Sunday, 
defeating Arkansas 3-1 and notching another 
conference road victory.
After a nail-biting win against No. 6 
Texas A&M Friday night, the Gators (10-2, 
5-0 Southeastern Conference) played the 
unranked Razorbacks (6-3-4, 2-1-2 SEC) in Fayetteville, Ark., in a contest that had all the makings of a trap-game.
But Florida was ready.The Gators controlled possession from the 
start of the game but were unable to create any quality chances early on.
But in the 22nd minute, Liz Slattery took 
a cross from a corner kick and scored the game’s ﬁ  rst goal, a diving header that gave the goalkeeper no chance to react.
Florida coach Becky Burleigh appreciated 
the quality goal from Slattery, who was in-serted into the starting lineup Sunday from her normal substitute position.
“The diving header was awesome,” Bur-
leigh said. “We always say in practice diving 
headers count double, unfortunately in real games they don’t.”
Savannah Jordan added her team-leading 
ninth goal of the season in the 34th minute to 
push Florida’s lead to two goals, which the Gators would take into the half.
It appeared the Gators had control of the 
match, but the Razorbacks were not ready to give up just yet, and Arkansas came out swinging to start the second half.
In the 61st minute, the Razorbacks capital-
ized on a set piece — an area of weakness for the Gators according to Burleigh – and cut the lead to one.
They continued to pressure Florida and 
took a number of shots, including one that hit the post in the 67th minute.
But Florida regained its composure and 
began to sustain possession again, relieving the pressure on the defenders. And in the 80th minute, the Gators put the nail in the cofﬁ  n.
Tessa Andujar had the ball on the right 
side of the Razorbacks goal, just outside the penalty box. She took her defender to the 
right, then cut back to the left and took a shot 
with her left foot.

TURNING POINT
Florida’s offense appeared to regain life once Treon Harris stepped in as 
quarterback. While he only completed two of his four attempts and almost had 
a pass intercepted, the true freshman continually moved the chains and led 
Florida to both of its scoring drives.
Cox had a career day against the 
Volunteers and helped the Gators 
establish a consistent pass rush. 
The redshirt sophomore — who 
finished the 2013 season with 
five total tackles and two sacks — 
tallied five solo tackles and sacked Tennessee quarterback 
Justin Worley three times. 
Late in the third quarter, Jalen Tabor 
ran into the Tennessee backfield on 
a second-down corner blitz. The true 
freshman cornerback sacked Tennessee 
signal caller Justin Worley, forced him 
to cough up the ball and fell on it for the 
fumble recovery.
Matt Jones continues to separate 
himself as UF’s leading tailback. 
The junior rambled off his second 
triple-digit rushing performance 
of the season against the 
Volunteers, totaling 114 yards 
on 23 rushes. Jones also had a team-high four 
receptions.
With Florida up with less than a minute 
to go in the game, the UF defense 
needed to contain Tennessee. Keanu 
Neal did just that, intercepting a Worley 
first-down pass with 51 seconds remain
 -
ing to give the Gators the ball and the game.
Hardin may have only had one 
field-goal attempt against Tennes
 -
see, but the redshirt sophomore 
made the most of it. Hardin 
sailed a 49-yard kick through the 
uprights with 6:20 remaining in the 
game to give the Gators a 10-9 lead that they would keep for 
good.
