Texting while driving is now a 
ticketable offense across the state.
The “Florida Ban on Texting 
While Driving Law,” which went  
into effect today, designates texting 
while driving as a secondary of-
fense, which means police can ticket drivers for texting only if they were pulled over for something else.
According to the bill, “A person 
may not operate a motor vehicle while manually typing or entering multiple letters, numbers ... into a wireless communications device or while sending or reading data in such a device.”
The bill does make exemptions 
for drivers using their cellphones to 
navigate, get safety information or 
report emergencies to authorities. 
Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said local ofﬁ  -cers will focus on educating drivers about how the new law applies, but they also won’t be shy about ticket-ing.
“There’s not going to be a grace 
period,” he said. “People know it’s been coming.”
Because texting is a secondary of-
fense, ofﬁ  cers will be forced to ﬁ  nd other reasons to pull texters over.
“It’s taking your attention away 
from such a complicated task,” he said. “Finding a primary offense is going to be easy.”Texting and driving law in effect

Students were concerned when their beloved, normally 
punctual professor didn’t show up for their history class.
Alan Cecil Petigny, a UF alumnus, author and tenured 
associate professor, passed away unexpectedly in his home 
last week from natural causes.He was 43.Ida Altman, chair of the UF history 
department, said she attempted to get in 
touch with Petigny on Thursday, after stu-dents said he hadn’t been to class for sev-eral days.
“It wasn’t until early evening that I was 
able to talk to his mother, and she told me that she hadn’t heard from him,” said 
Altman. “At that point I became alarmed and called the po-lice.”
Petigny was raised in Tampa, where he attended the Uni-
versity of South Florida and graduated with honors in 1992. 
He won awards for his contributions to a Tampa public ra-
dio station and served as a policy analyst for the U.S. Con-gress Joint Economic Committee.
His book, “The Permissive Society: America, 1941-1965,” 
was published by Cambridge University Press in 2009.
His mother, Pearl Petigny, 83, said he attended UF as a UF teacher remembered for history lessons, love of reading � THE LAST GOVERNMENT 
SHUTDOWN WAS IN 1995.

The federal government 
shut down at midnight be-
cause of a standstill in bud-
get negotiations between 
the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives.
For UF, the shutdown 
will impact the institution’s research projects, which rely on ﬁ  nancial support from federal grants and agencies.
According to a memo from 
David Norton, UF research vice president, research us-ing money already disbursed to the university can contin-
ue without interruption, un-
less a “stop work” order has been issued.
Federal student aid such 
as Pell grants will not be af-
fected, said U.S. Rep. Ted 
Yoho in a statement. 
The shutdown is expected 
to have minimal impact on 
the city of Gainesville, but 
that may change as more in-formation becomes available to local ofﬁ  cials, said city spokesman Bob Woods. 
Gainesville’s Regional 
Transit System bus lines, one of two city services Woods said receives federal fund-ing, is not at risk. 
“We don’t foresee it im-
pacting our service whatso-
ever,” said Chip Skinner, an 
RTS spokesman. 
President Barack Obama 
released a statement Mon-day evening that painted a 
more disruptive picture of 
the shutdown.
“Ofﬁ  ce buildings would 
close. Paychecks would be delayed. Vital services that seniors and veterans, wom-
en and children, businesses 
and our economy depend on would be hamstrung,” Obama wrote. 
Social Security, Medicare, 
the U.S. Postal Service, the Armed Forces and NASA Mission Control will remain in operation, according to 
the statement. 
The Affordable Care Act’s 
open enrollment period will 
commence today as planned.

ment shutdown started in 1995 and lasted less than a month.Federal government

A newly opened barbecue restaurant decided to grace one 
of its outside walls with a mural. But there is one thing keeping 
the vibrant, pink pig ﬂ  ashing its pearly whites on the side of the building from complying with city regulations. 
In an email to city commissioners, City Manager Russ 
Blackburn explained that Billy-Bobz Bar-B-Q’s mural, located at 1228 W. University Ave., includes the restaurant’s name in the artwork.
Because “Billy-Bobz Bar-B-Q” is painted next to the pig ad-
vertising the business without a permit to do so, this converts the artwork from a mural to a sign in accordance with the city’s sign code.
“This ordinance prohibits erecting a sign without obtaining 
the required permits,” said city spokesman Bob Woods.
The restaurant was given a written notice by the city Sept. 
13 mandating it comply by taking down the sign or applying for a permit. City code enforcer Chris Cooper gave the business 60 days to comply with city ordinances to work out a solution. Otherwise, the case will be sent to the Code Board and ﬁ  nes could be imposed. 
Blackburn wrote in an email that the Modern Age Tobacco 
and Gift Shop’s mural — located at 1122 W. University Ave. — is a similar case. 
He said the mural was at one time in compliance with city 
codes but has since “freshened up” by adding its name — an instance Blackburn said city staff will also follow up on. 
“If the owner applies for the permit, city staff will work to 
ﬁ  nd a viable option for the business owner while still meeting requirements of city ordinances,” Woods said. 
Derek Dever, co-owner of Billy-Bobz, said throughout the 
negotiations, customers at Billy-Bobz Bar-B-Q have given the restaurant “nothing but support.”
“We are just a new business trying to get our name out 
there,” he said.Mural at barbecue restaurant sparks saucy negotiations

The cheap seats for statewide bus travel 
just got cheaper.
Red Coach Bus lines recently introduced 
a new economy-class bus ﬂ  eet, which boasts 
a new stop at the UF commuter lot, free Wi-
Fi and a $75 round-trip ticket option from 
Gainesville to Miami.Additionally, Red Coach added business-
class buses that leave at earlier times during the week and offer trips between Orlando and Miami for $30 each way. 
These services will begin Oct. 11.Frances Alemany, the ofﬁ  ce manager for 
Red Coach, said the company has received positive feedback from students.
“We have seen a signiﬁ  cant growth of stu-
dents using the economy class,” she said. “Ev-ery week, we have noticed an increase in the number of students taking advantage of this new service.”Hannah Schulte, a 20-year-old UF linguis-
tics junior who has taken Red Coach buses, 
said the additional lines sound more conve-
nient.
“I think the new service geared towards 
students will be much more effective — es-pecially the prices,” she said. “The Red Coach was really expensive when I took it … I would probably take it again now that it’s cheaper and more convenient.”
Tiffanny Samuels, a UF health education 
and behavior senior, said the drop in price from Gainesville to Miami is most likely a tactic to compete with other bus systems with cheaper prices. 
“That’s a signiﬁ  cant drop for them, and 
that might bring in a lot more revenue,” she said. “They’re probably trying to compete with other buses that are cheaper, but not as comfortable.” Red Coach adds commuter lot stop, economy and business lines � EIGHT STUDENT

UF students gathered Thursday 
evening on Turlington Plaza for a 
candlelight vigil commemorating the 
lives of those affected by the tragedy 
at the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Ke-nya.
On Sept. 21, al-Shabab claimed re-
sponsibility for the armed shooting that wounded more than 200 civilians and led to dozens of deaths.
Deepa Pindolia, a Kenyan-born 
27-year-old UF doctoral student, or-
ganized the event. She brought to-
gether eight student organizations for the vigil, including Gators for ASHA, Student Government, the Pakistan Student Association and UF Interna-tional Student Services.
“It felt like a long, horrible night-
mare,” she said. “It could have been 
anyone at the wrong place at the 
wrong time.”
Dean of the UF International Cen-
ter David Sammons said as soon as the attacks were reported, Student 
Support Services reached out to all of 
the Kenyan students at UF.
“We always try to ﬁ  nd out if any 
students were directly impacted by 
any international conﬂ  icts in their 
home countries,” he said.
The vigil also included a Messages 
of Hope display where students were encouraged to share their condolenc-
es with the civilians impacted by the 
terrorist attacks at the Westgate Mall. The board will be shipped to Kenya and displayed outside of the mall. Vigil commemorates those 
lost in Kenya mall shooting 
“I think the new service geared 
towards students will be much more 
effective — especially the prices.”

“He called me every single day,” she said. 
“And if I didn’t seem all right, then he would call 
two or three times.”
The youngest of five, Petigny was always a vo-
racious reader. 
His mother recalls when they briefly lived in 
Paris, she would go to the English bookstore to 
buy him books on history, which he taught him-self to read.
“He was the most selfless person I’ve ever 
known,” she said. “He never had a single thought 
for himself, always for his students, his family.”
Petigny was said to have a way with words 
and a voice made for radio. He had a great sense 
of humor that always kept his students and col-
leagues entertained.
“The faculty is still in shock,” said Louise 
Newman, an associate professor of history at UF 
and colleague of Petigny’s.
Newman and Petigny first met 20 years ago 
when she attended one of his presentations.
“His speaking skills were remarkable, even 
then,” she said. “He understood how to make a presentation interesting. This was before Power-Point; there were no visuals. He did it all with his 
voice, painting pictures and telling a narrative.”
Petigny, who played racquetball with his col-
leagues in his spare time, was an inspiration to 
many of his students.
Margaret MacDonald, now an adjunct pro-
fessor of history at Stetson University, sat in his classroom 13 years ago. She compares her rela-tionship with Petigny to Jimmy Stewart’s role in “It’s a Wonderful Life.”
“If this one person, Dr. Petigny, had been re-
moved, my entire life would have been differ-ent,” she said. “He was always there at the right moment.”
MacDonald had originally come to UF with 
the intention of getting her degree in education, but after taking a history course with and being encouraged by Petigny, she chose to pursue his-tory instead.
“He went above and beyond the call of duty 
for his students to encourage them,” MacDonald said.
The memorial service is tentatively scheduled 
for Oct. 18, Altman said.
Petigny is survived by his mother, Pearl, his 
older brothers Arthur and Ludlow, and his older sisters Michelle and Sheila.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2013

Multiple residents reported 
burglaries and credit fraud 
Sunday afternoon surrounding the 300 Swim and Tennis Club, located at 3715 NW 12 Ave.
Gainesville Police and Ala-
chua County Sheriff’s Office re-ceived and responded to simi-lar complaints, according to an email from Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
In one incident, a woman 
and her 12-year-old daughter confronted a man wearing bag-
gy pants and a red-and-white 
shirt who appeared to be trying to break into her car, which was parked at the club. She hit the man with a tennis racket, and he drove away in a Toyota Co-rolla with an Oklahoma license plate. 
As he sped away, he hit the 
woman, but she was not hurt, Tobias said.
Investigations into the string 
of incidents — including the happenings at the tennis club and burglaries at Gainesville Health and Fitness Club and Westside Park — are ongoing, he said. 
Tobias attributed the events 
to a group he referred to as 
“Felony Lane.” 
“This group moves ex-
tremely quickly, and they are 
very difficult to track,” Tobias said. “This crime can be pre-ventable if people simply hide or take their belongings from their vehicle.”Police identify

tendees, the two have hopes of working for aerospace engineering companies like SpaceX.But Luis Valle, 23, and Leo Caro, 24, 
have different strategies to land a job.
The two-day Career Showcase begin-

Microsoft and the CIA.
The first day is for non-technical po-
sitions, according to a news release. 
Wednesday will be for technical jobs, like engineering and computer science.
This year, there will be a LinkedIn pho-
tobooth for students to take headshots for their online profiles, said Dana McPherson, 
Career Resource Center spokeswoman.
Held twice a year, the showcase is the 
largest career fair in the Southeast, accord-
ing to the release.Valle has attended every showcase 
since last year, but has always sought out different companies.
“As time progresses in college, you 
get to know yourself better and you start shaping yourself toward what you really want to do,” Valle said.
As for Caro, he’s gone after the same 
company every time.
Now he’s going back to try again.“It’s definitely scary at the beginning, 
but I think it’s important for everyone to 
get out of their comfort zone and go there 
and give it a shot,” Valle said.Career showcase begins today for non-technical positions

Students Party’s and Swamp 
Party’s most popular members 
don’t spend long afternoons handing out fliers and reciting platform points. 
Party dogs have one goal: to 
look cute and represent.
The parties’ four-legged, furry 
mascots debuted last Spring as an unconventional way to grab students’ attention.
Achilles, a 2-year-old full-bred 
husky, was a hit on Turlington 
Plaza last semester clad in a fit-
ted Students Party shirt.
After an overwhelming posi-
tive response from students, owner DJ Kurtz, a 21-year-old telecommunication senior and Students Party supporter, was 
asked by a friend if Achilles 
could be the party’s first official mascot.
“People fell in love with him 
instantly,” he said.
But this semester, a string of 
hot and humid days kept fur-coated Achilles off the campaign trail. 
Kurtz plans to bring him back 
out for Spring campaigning.
“It serves as a good platform 
because it’s an icebreaker,” Kurtz said. “And he’s adorable, but I’m biased.”
Coco, a 7-year-old Australian 
shepherd, strolls around Turl-ington Plaza with a Swamp Party 
bandana made from a party T-
shirt.
“It’s kind of a nice de-stressor 
to play with a cute dog,” said owner Liat Sanz, a 20-year-old anthropology junior and District D candidate. “It’s nice to have him right by my side.”Furry friends return as

Cade’s inventions,” UF President Bernie Machen said at the ceremony. “At UF, he continues to in-spire students and faculty to follow their curios-ity and persist in their ambitions.”The Cade Museum will open its doors in De-
pot Park in November 2015, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the ﬁ  rst time Gatorade was used at Lousiana State University.
Cade’s daughter and the founder and CEO of 
the Cade Museum, Phoebe Cade Miles, accepted the award for her father.
“Here at the Cade Museum, it’s not just about 
the past,” she said. “We want to use the Gatorade 
story to inspire a new generation of creative think-
ers, future inventors and early entrepreneurs.”
Miles said her dad wasn’t a great student and 
came from a humble background. 
“He surely would be honored to be named a 
Great Floridian,” Machen said. “But the greatest honor we could bestow is to follow his example of research, teamwork and community service to create a better future through innovation.”Late Gatorade inventor honored

The Ofﬁ  ce of Graduate Minor-
ity Programs is expecting a name 
change in the near future.
The word “minority” will be 
removed from the name and re-placed with “diversity.”
“The name change has been 
talked about for a number of years,” said David W. Mazyck, interim associate dean for gradu-ate minority programs. “I’m not thinking ﬁ  ve or 10 years ahead, 
I’m thinking how this name will 
work 50 years down the line when there is no minority because the minority is the majority.”
Mazyck said the new vision 
for the ofﬁ  ce will be presented this month.
But some stu-
dents are wary about the new name and the changes it could 
bring.
Janine Park-
er, a second-year 
doctoral candi-
date in international extension, 
agriculture, said she doesn’t un-
derstand why the name change is necessary. 
She said she fears the new name will cause discrepancies among students.
“It will affect the new gradu-
ate minority students who don’t know about the ofﬁ  ce,” Parker 
said. “They might not readily 
identify as diverse since the term leaves room for ambiguity.”
Mazyck said nothing is chang-
ing in structure, they are just looking to enhance the ofﬁ  ce and the services offered.
Chris Weaver, a second-year 
doctoral candidate in public pol-
icy and statistics, said as long as 
the ofﬁ  ce continues to offer the same programs, he supports the name change.Minority office to change nameYour guide to elections

Fall 2013 SG 
endorsement
Historically, the Alligator has chosen to endorse one party 
over another within Student Government. 
This semester, however, the editorial board has de-
cided to endorse platform points from each party. These prom-ises are what their campaigns are based on — especially in an 
election without executive candidates — so the Alligator wanted 
to take a closer look at some of the proposed projects.
Both the Swamp Party and Students Party basically agreed 
in four areas: expanding free printing with more locations and more stations, promoting sustainability efforts, increasing aw-nings and shelters at bus stops and providing more resources to UF students who own bicycles. The Alligator thinks all of these areas could use improvement, and we commend both parties on identifying these student needs.
We were especially impressed by the Swamp Party’s initia-
tive to add self-service bike stations at residence halls. Those would get some serious use from students who live both on- and off-campus.
The Alligator’s editorial board also supports the Students 
Party’s proposed implementation of a waiting-list system for ISIS class registration. We think this would result in a smoother process for all students. Everyone knows stalking ISIS is no fun.
The Swamp Party suggested adding screens at the Hub 
displaying RTS bus-route tracking. Because the Hub is such a high-trafﬁ  c area for bus-goers as well as campus visitors, the board supports this measure and feels it would beneﬁ  t a large number of UF students — especially those without smartphones.
The Students Party also proposed bringing The New York 
Times and USA Today readership programs back to campus. For obvious reasons, the editorial board wholeheartedly sup-ports this. Many students, faculty and staff took advantage of 
this service, and we’re disappointed by SG’s mishandling of bill-
ings for those programs.
Finally, we support the Students Party’s proposed zero-based 
budgeting plan. Under zero-based budgeting, funding for all student and academic organizations would begin at zero each year, and committees would evaluate the size and scope of each organization before determining how much funding would be allocated to each organization. 
But the editorial board didn’t agree with either party’s pro-
posed measures related to BlueLight’s presence on campus. The Students Party said it wanted to invest in repairs of certain Blue-Light poles on campus, and the Swamp Party is promoting its UF-tailored BlueLight App — which is still in development. 
Before moving forward, the Alligator asks that SG investi-
gate the efﬁ  ciency of the existing BlueLight poles. It’s unclear how many of them are used and how many crimes they’ve ef-fectively stopped. As for the BlueLight App, there’s already one available on both the App Store and Google Play. In most cases, 
the board feels, students are more likely to dial 911 rather than 
try to ﬁ  nd a BlueLight pole or open an app.
Bottom line, Gators: It’s your university, your SG and your 
dollars. Research the candidates in your district, read each par-ty’s platform and vote!

During my junior summer in Gainesville, I started 
feeling a thirst for something other than college life. 
It could have been the unforgiving landlocked climate, 
but as I hit the melting asphalt in August 2011 with all my 
belongings packed into my car, I knew I had to quench 
that thirst eventually.
The illogical but gorgeous postcard of a city that is 
Rio de Janeiro was my ﬁ  rst calling. 
I spent six months in Brazil’s samba and crime capital 
wearing several hats — including the traditional straw 
fedora I lost to the Atlantic Ocean among millions of 
other offerings to the sea gods to bring in the new year. 
As a foreigner in this chaotic metropolis, I was fair 
game for any “malandragem,” loosely translated to 
“mischief.” 
Really, this was what Rio embodied: a sense that 
being anything less than a rascal meant being a sitting duck for the other rogues out there.
When my grant from the federal university was 
“delayed” because of a two-month national strike, I started working as an English teacher at an engineering 
ﬁ  rm downtown.
I peddled my language skills, the only thing my 19-
year-old self could truly offer in a free market. 
I had to get by in a country I didn’t understand. I was glad for the messiness of the “real world,” but 
even chaos has some order. 
I remember walking into an abandoned factory in 
Northern Rio de Janeiro, where the “slum” community had created a semi-functional city within its dilapidated 
walls. 
Sheets and tin panels divided space, and sharing a 
pot of rice and beans was their way of networking.
I left Rio and returned to Gainesville. Naturally, 
that summer, I headed south again: this time, to my hometown. Miami echoed Rio in 
some ways — beautiful and terrifying. 
I learned about the city by 
writing headlines and briefs about sunny Miami’s shadowy characters and darkest corners.
Miami bid me “a bientot” 
last August. 
I knew I was stretching out my time away from 
school, but I decided to go to Paris to continue working in the journalism industry as an intern. 
I worked in a corporate ofﬁ  ce in La Defense, a 
futuristic ﬁ  nancial district of Paris. 
My group of friends were from all corners of the 
globe, but we saw no cultural barriers as soon as we 
shared a cheap bottle of merlot and a baguette on a 
surprisingly cold night in August. 
With some time back in the states now, I’ve started 
to try to put my experiences together like puzzle pieces I picked up along the way. 
I’m unsure if they will even create a recognizable 
image in the end, but these memories, lessons and experiences I’ve collected outside of school have made me a better student. 
I value what I’m learning here even more now and 
I’m happy to be back, if even for a short semester. 
The wanderlust has been satiated — at least until the 
next adventure. 
Bottom line: If you’re thinking about going hiking 
for a few months in the Appalachians, or working as an English teacher in South Korea, or just going back home to spend some time helping with the family business, don’t think it’s a setback — it might just take you to 
exactly where you want to be.

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
There is a very political debate within 
the world of sports centered on the re-lationship between the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association and student ath-letes and the fact that players, though they 
may be worth thousands of dollars, often live well be-
low the poverty line while coaches, universities and the NCAA reap millions of dollars in proﬁ  ts off their backs.  
This issue was brought to national attention when 28 
players from Georgia, Northwestern and Georgia Tech wrote “APU” — All Players United — on their wrist-bands during the games two weeks ago. The protest was sponsored by the NCAA, whose goals are, among other things, to reverse its long-standing position that col-
legiate athletes are amatuer athletes, who by deﬁ  nition 
cannot receive any form of payment for playing. 
This issue is very complicated, which is one way of 
saying any potential solution is bound to piss off a large number of people. No one can blame athletes for want-ing a cut of the billion-dollar industry that wouldn’t exist without them. 
But this shouldn’t extend to the collegiate level: Giv-
ing salaries to players would do nothing but ﬁ  nalize the transformation of students who happen to be athletes into athletes who happen to be students.  
The unequal distribution of funds and 
resources across athletic programs would 
apply to salaries, too — every time someone uses the word “athletes” in this debate, what they’re truly say-ing is “football players,” because that’s who create all the revenue to begin with. Let them work, let them receive royalties on the sales of their own jerseys, subsidize their housing — even have a national standard cost of living stipend — but don’t give them salaries. 
Not that the NCAA doesn’t desperately need reform. 
The reason players are voicing their frustrations in the 
form of protest is that they’re being taken advantage of. 
In addition to the millions the NCAA already makes on broadcasts, even more money is made off of the like-nesses of players, maintaining a veneer of innocence while it extracts all the money it can out of the efforts of the athletes.  
Amateur athletics should be preserved, but not by an 
organization that does so for the sake of proﬁ  t.

Today is the day many have been dreading — the ﬁ  rst day 
of the enrollment process for the Affordable Care Act. The hallmark legislation of the Obama Administration takes its 
ﬁ  rst steps as we speak. 
Because of the legislation’s sweep-
ing scope and controversial nature, it is difﬁ  cult to parse through all of the noise 
that comes out of D.C. and the media 
regarding Obamacare. 
But here is what we know so far:First, the Affordable Care Act is not 
ready for primetime. 
This should not surprise anyone 
simply due to the fact that the mantra of center-left coalition which 
passed the bill was, as Nancy Pelosi put it, “pass (Obamacare) so 
that you can ﬁ  nd out what is in it.” They created a nightmare bill that includes pages of regulation and bureaucratic inefﬁ  ciency.  
Proof the bill is not ready for primetime lies in the sheer amount 
of delays the bill has racked up. The administration delayed two 
key provisions of the law in July, delayed the pocket caps in Au-
gust and delayed the enrollment of most small-business exchanges scheduled to open today.
A more damning indictment of the bill is that the administra-
tion has not veriﬁ  ed Obamacare’s security claims.   
Second, President Barack Obama misled the public on the 
promises of Obamacare. 
Obama promised the American people, “If you like your health 
care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.”
Contrary to the reassuring words of Obama, conservative activ-
ist Michelle Malkin recently found herself without her health care. 
Malkin wrote, “Last week, our family received notice from 
Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado that we can no lon-ger keep the plan we like because of ‘changes from health care reform’… The letter informed us that ‘to meet the requirements of the new laws, your current plan can no longer be continued be-
yond your 2014 renewal date.’”
The administration has stated premiums would be lower than 
what the budget experts estimated. However, Avik Roy of the 
Manhattan Institute for Policy Research said the administration “cherry picked the data in order to highlight the fact that people 
of low income will beneﬁ  t under the law, but people of middle 
income will not,” and added that the partial subsidy that the aver-
age American gets, “won’t be enough to overcome the dramatic increase in the cost of insurance.”   
Also, businesses are dropping overages and reducing hours 
due to the law.  
Third and ﬁ  nally, the Right needs to reevaluate and refocus.   Having failed to repeal and defund Obamacare, the GOP does 
not know how to proceed. The party needs to realize the lack of a viable alternative to Obamacare hurts them in the health care de-
bate. The party also needs to realize lambasting Obamacare is a 
great campaign strategy, but promising that the law can be com-
pletely defunded is dishonest. 
For better or worse, Washington is now controlled by grass-
roots activists. And for better or worse, the leader of the grassroots 
activists for the right is Sen. Ted Cruz. 
While I prefer to have a political party that has different ap-
proaches to policy issues, the GOP needs to keep public inﬁ  ght-
ing to a minimum. Then the party needs to refocus its energy on 
the upcoming budget battles and combat runaway entitlement programs. I concede that the state of our health care even before 
Obamacare was bad, but I’d argue that adding more regulation, 
confusion and bureaucracy to the problem will not ﬁ  x it.
And I do not believe Obama passed the bill because he wants 
to destroy America. I believe it is a ﬂ  awed — perhaps even tragi-cally ﬂ  awed — attempt to ﬁ  x a bad health care system by virtue of 
the president’s big government — again ﬂ  awed — beliefs.   If you 
thought passing, litigating and attempting to defund the law was a 
bumpy ride, fasten your seatbelts for its implementation.

Kaley Loewendick didn’t know 
what to do when her MacBook Pro 
fell off her top bunk two years ago.
The 20-year-old nursing junior 
turned to the UF Apple Service 
Center to fix the shattered screen, 
but shortly after, it broke again.
“I will never go back to that 
place,” Loewendick said.
If her Apple laptop broke now, 
she’d have more options.
GatorTec, a Gainesville-based 
Apple retail store, opened a new lo-cation Friday in Butler Plaza in the 
space formerly occupied by Casual 
Male.
Now with a second location at 
3600 SW Archer Road, GatorTec is the only company in the area autho-rized to sell and repair most Apple products, excluding iPhones.
GatorTec owner Jim Dufek said 
he expects the store will service iP-
hones in the next six months.
The store differs from some oth-
er local repair shops because it does 
not perform unauthorized repairs on the phones, he said. 
Dufek said his store only uses 
Apple authorized parts and works on in-warranty products, unlike ReTech, another repair store locat-
ed in Butler Plaza. He said his store 
will also price match Best Buy and offers a greater selection of repairs and products.
GatorTec customers can come 
in for training sessions on how to use various Apple products, Dufek said.
“We have people that are in 
their 70s and 80s,” he said. “They learn how to use their computer for things they never thought pos-sible.”
The first GatorTec location, 
which opened in Tioga Town Cen-ter almost three years ago, attracted customers from the other side of town.
Dufek said he was constantly receiving requests to open another, more centrally located store. He said the store at Butler Plaza will 
draw more foot traffic from both 
students and locals.
The new location is larger and 
has many more products on dis-play for customers to test. It also of-fers a theater room for customers to try out wireless speakers and other home theater technologies.
The store is a continuation of the 
Butler Plaza redevelopment plan, which includes the summer open-ings of Pollo Tropical, Yogurtology and Pink Narcissus, wrote plaza spokeswoman Kristin Mamula in an email.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2013

In the four months that have ticked by 
since Mayor Ed Braddy was sworn into of-
fice, he has overseen accomplishments and 
setbacks for the city of Gainesville.  
Braddy, who said he feels the pressure 
the city places on him to keep things run-
ning smoothly, said he felt confident his first quarter in office has been productive.
“We’re already doing a lot of things 
well — about as well as can be expected,” he said. “It’s a great privilege and a good feeling, but I know there’s a lot of weight 
being placed on the office to really turn the 
city and get it moving in the right direc-tion.”
Though the City Commission is a non-
partisan body, Braddy, a Republican may-or working with a majority of Democratic commissioners, said he thinks the coop-eration of the commission has probably surprised residents who predicted major clashes would ensue.
“The challenges the city faces are real 
and serious, so it’s not expected that we’re all going to hold hands and roast marsh-mallows together. These are difficult times,” he said. “Sometimes you see votes 
that are 7-0, or 6-1, but a number of times, 
we’ve seen 4-3 votes that suggest we are trying to work together on what are, ad-mittedly, difficult issues.”
Standing in the category of unhappy 
residents is Robert Prather, chair of the Alachua County Democratic Party. 
He said Braddy’s time as mayor will 
most likely not continue past this term. 
“Mayor Braddy … has been largely in-
effective in gathering support,” he said.
Prather cited push-back against city 
staff, environmental causes and neighbor-hood protection issues among arenas he said Braddy caused dissention in.
“The one bright spot in his tenure as 
mayor so far is that his caustic attitude and unwillingness to compromise will ensure 
these are his final few years in office,” he 
said. 
While the commis-
sion remains split on is-sues such as GRU rate 
hikes and the biomass 
plant, one of the accom-plishments the commis-
sion has embraced is the 
small-business forum 
that was organized in 
May, Braddy said.
Kamal Latham, vice president of public 
policy for the Gainesville Area Chamber of 
Commerce, said the forum was designed 
to produce recommendations to make 
growing small businesses easier and cre-ate dialogue between the city and small business efforts.
“It was a very significant impact that we 
would say Mayor Braddy had,” Latham said. “It was his idea to have the forum, and he was very instrumental in moving it forward, “ he said. 
Latham said the forum was one of the 
biggest public policy accomplishments for the chamber this year because it’s “very tangible, very real and has an impact,” he said.
Braddy also said he’s striving to help 
residents change the way they view city government.
“My long-term goal is to slowly but 
steadily turn the ship from a command-and-control mentality in terms of how the city develops,” he said. “I want us to move towards an active role where we pretty much channel their aspirations and the city will grow that way.”
Braddy’s girlfriend of six years, Char-
maine Spence, said although he has a myriad of issues to deal with, she can tell 
Braddy loves what he’s doing.
“It’s something he really enjoys do-
ing because he believes in running a city 
smoothly,” she said. “He’s ready for the challenges, and he doesn’t try to make ev-
erybody happy.”

UF’s new African-
American studies major is in 
full swing this semester after 
its approval by the Board of 
Governors over the summer.
Sharon Wright Austin, 
director of African-American 
studies at UF and associate 
professor of political science, said the program has been pushing for the major for several years, with an already 
successful minor and student 
demand driving the effort.
“When people think of 
African-American studies, 
they think of African-
American students taking the classes,” she said. “The classes are very diverse, it shows students of all races 
and all ethnicities have an 
interest in African-American studies.”
Austin said seven students 
are currently signed up for the major, along with 15 in the minor program.
She said the courses are 
interdisciplinary, covering a wide range of topics and aiding students with writing 
and critical thinking skills. 
According to the African-
American studies website, 
students must take 30 credit hours of elective and core 
coursework to complete the 
major, and fulfill all of the requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree in the College 
of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Tahiri Jean-Baptiste, 
a 21-year-old English, 
anthropology and African-American studies triple major, 
said she felt her education 
would have been incomplete without the new program.
“When you’re taught 
history in school, the things you learn are from one specific perspective, one person’s story,” Jean-Baptiste said. 
“African-American studies 
takes it a step further and tells it from every perspective.”New African-American

Freshman cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III was

was cleared to play for Florida this season. Read the 
story on page 13. PHILLIP HEILMAN

Dominique Easley’s career with the 
Gators is finished. 
Easley, a senior, suffered season-ending 
tears of the ACL and meniscus in his right 
knee during practice Sept. 24. On Monday, 
coach Will Muschamp confirmed his star defensive tackle intends to turn pro rather than return as a redshirt senior next season. 
“Dominique is definitely going to the 
NFL next year,” Muschamp said. “I think that’s the best move for him right now.
“He and I talked briefly about it, and 
that’s what he wants to do, and I support it 
100 percent.”
Easley sustained the injury during a non-
contact drill, continuing an alarming trend 
of Florida players suffering torn ACLs this season. 
After only two players — Easley and 
Ronald Powell — suffered torn ACLs dur-ing Muschamp’s first two seasons at UF, three athletes — Easley, Andre Debose and 
Matt Rolin — have suffered serious knee in-
juries this season.
“Two in three years is good,” Muschamp 
said. “You never want it to happen. Two in three months, then you’re scratching your 
head a little bit in how you practice and are 
you practicing the right way.”
The sudden high frequency of knee in-
juries prompted Muschamp to seek advice from UF’s medical and strength staffs, as well as outside orthopedics. 
Muschamp said he received confirma-
tion that UF was doing everything possible to prevent injuries from occurring. 
“It’s three non-contact situations. It’s a 
guy planting and changing directions — 
that can happen in the offseason program, 
that can happen walking to class,” Mus-champ said. “There’s nothing we’re doing wrong.”
Debose, a redshirt senior receiver who 
suffered a torn ACL during practice in Au-gust, has not decided whether he will return for a sixth season with the Gators. 
In three games this season, Easley, who 
was voted a preseason First Team All-Southeastern Conference selection by the league’s coaches in August, contributed two tackles for a loss and four quarterback hurries, which tied Powell for the most on 
the team.

The Gators’ outside backs are fueling their offense in 
Southeastern Conference play.
Florida split results during road matchups with Ole 
Miss and Missouri last weekend but found solace in out-
side back Claire Falknor.
Against the Rebels on Friday, the sophomore 
found herself near the box, open and ready for 
a pass from freshman midfielder Pamela Begic.  Falknor turned and took a chance, shooting the ball into 
the net to give the Gators a 3-0 lead after 15 minutes of 
play. 
The goal was Falknor’s first this season.
After turning in a 4-1 win at Ole Miss, Florida played 
to a different tune on Sunday.
The Tigers shook up the Gators in the eighth minute 
when junior midfielder Kaysie Clark put one in the left corner of Florida’s net.
Florida came out refreshed in the second half, taking 
12 shots and racking up seven corner kick opportunities but failed to score an equalizing goal.
“In our sport, the game can be swung at any moment,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “You never know when that moment is. So it’s about being focused and doing the little things right.”
In the 73rd minute, outside back Lauren Silver had a 
look to the left of the goal. 
The junior ran the ball in from the side and took a shot 
off her left foot. Outside backs providing offensive spark for Gators in SEC play

Coach Will Muschamp called 
him first-class. 
Defensive coordinator D.J. 
Durkin said he was a “luxury.” 
Redshirt junior linebacker Mi-
chael Taylor described him as a 
smart football player.
For Jaylen Watkins, versatile 
is a better label. The senior defen-sive back leads Florida with 22 tackles from the corner-back and 
strong safety 
positions. Watkins, who started at 
cornerback in the season opener, replaced redshirt freshman Mar-cus Maye at the strong safety a 
week later.
With Matt Elam and Josh Ev-
ans leaving for the NFL, Florida 
had to replace both of its starting safeties. 
As a safety, Watkins repre-
sents the last line of defense. The 
Gators, missing their two top 
tacklers from a year ago, needed the experienced Watkins to make the transition.
Watkins knew he didn’t tackle 
well last year. 
He added weight and worked 
on fixing his tackling issues dur-ing the offseason.“I wasn’t the best tackler last 
year, and that’s something I worked on,” Watkins said. “Being 
back there at safety has allowed 
me to showcase that I’ve gotten better at tackling.”
Watkins started for cornerback 
Loucheiz Purifoy, who didn’t 
play in Week 1 due to a violation 
of team rules. 
When the Florida secondary 
has been in a bind, Watkins has been there to clean up the mess.
He appeared in all but three 
games in three seasons heading 
into this year. 
He’s manned just about every 
position in the secondary — the 
dime, nickel and both cornerback spots.
“That’s a huge value to have 
in the back end. Not many guys can do that, to move from safety Watkins becoming versatile member of Florida secondary
UF Fo otball“Dominique is definitely going to 
the NFL next year. I think that’s the 
best move for him right now. He and 
I talked briefly about it, and that’s 
what he wants to do, and I support 
it 100 percent.”

Tyler Murphy attempts a pass during Florida’s 24-7 victory against 
Kentucky on Saturday at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington, Ky.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Two days after winning his first 
start for the Gators, Tyler Murphy 
was talking about First Take.
The telecommunication major 
said Monday that he would like to 
host a sports talk show similar to 
ESPN’s debate-centered program once his football career is over.
Until that day comes, Murphy 
will have to settle for giving Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith talking points — like his 13 con-secutive completions to start Sat-urday’s game.
“That’s something I don’t re-
ally try to pay attention to,” Mur-phy said. “I just focus on getting first downs and managing the game.”
Coach Will Muschamp was 
pleased with what he saw from his new starting quarterback on the road. Murphy’s demeanor in 
tough situations especially im-
pressed Muschamp.
“That’s one of his strengths: 
demeanor and how he handles things” Muschamp said. “Af-ter the interception, you would expect a guy to be down about things. He understood what hap-pened on the play.”
Although Murphy proved 
calm and collected throughout Florida’s 24-7 victory against Ken-tucky, he had an occasional strug-gle while adjusting to his new role last week during practice. The first few days, Murphy caught himself trying to do too much.
“Going out there and just get-
ting the experience of being a starter really helped,” Murphy said. 
“I’m starting to get used to the 
speed of the game. Hopefully, things will continue to slow down for me and I can continue to keep making progress and getting bet-ter.”
Gators getting stops: Nothing 
makes Jaylen Watkins prouder than stopping opponents on third down.
“It’s our job to keep them from 
getting a first down, and we’ve been doing that pretty well,” Wat-kins said.
Florida boasts the second-best 
defense in the nation, allowing only 202.5 yards per game.
But when it comes to stopping 
the opposition on third down, no team tops the Gators.
Kentucky moved the chains 
just once on eight third downs against Florida. The Gators have now limited opponents to an FBS-
best 17.8 percent third-down con-
version rate.
“That’s go-time,” Buck line-
backer Dante Fowler Jr. said. “So everybody, the defensive 
line, pins their ears back and the secondary gets ready so we can get off the field and get our of-fense back on the field. That’s like putting up points for us.”
Muschamp said the key to UF’s 
third-down success is a good four-man pass rush, playing man-to-
man on third and short and good 
zone principles on third and long.
He praised his staff’s ability to 
mix those concepts well enough to keep the opposing offense off balance. 
Through four games, the results 
have been good for the Gators.
“There’s a little subtle change 
on first and 10 and second down for us, but third down can be very drastic depending on the team we’re facing and what we carry into a game,” Muschamp said. 
“We’re trying to make the of-
fense adjust in those situations each game based on what they do.”
Jones breaks free: One glaring 
disparity in the box score follow-ing Florida’s 24-7 win against Ken-tucky was how running back Matt Jones stacked up against the Wild-cats. Jones tallied a career-high 176 yards on the ground, while Kentucky’s offense managed only 173 yards of total offense.
“That’s good for Matt,” Fowler 
said. 
“He hadn’t played a great 
game. And we don’t want them to get a lot of yards.”

Former Rutgers guard Eli Carter attempts a layup during a 68-65 
victory against George Washington University on Dec. 11, 2012.
men’S BASkeTBAll
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Rutgers transfer Eli Carter will see the floor for 
Florida this season. 
The NCAA granted Carter’s waiver to play imme-
diately, UF announced Monday morning. 
In the wake of the Mike Rice player-abuse scandal, 
the NCAA was expected to rule in Carter’s favor. 
Rutgers transfers Vincent Garrett (Wisconsin-
Green Bay), Mike Poole (Iona) and Derrick Randall 
(Pittsburgh) have also been granted eligibility for the 2013-14 season.
A 6-foot-2, 200-pound combo guard, Carter spe-
cializes as a scorer and a slasher. 
Last year at Rutgers, Carter was averaging a team-
high 14.9 points per game on 38.4 percent shooting, but his season ended when he suffered a fractured right fibula against DePaul on Feb. 16. 
He had successful surgery on his right leg Feb. 28 
but is still waiting to be medically cleared by Flori-da. 
In his two seasons with the Scarlet Knights, Carter 
started 46 of 56 games. 
“I’m really excited about him. He’s just a great 
kid,” center Patric Young said in May. 
“He will come in and be able to get to the bas-
ket a lot better than our guards have been able to in 
the past and just change the whole dynamic of our 
team.”
Despite losing guards Kenny Boynton and Mike 
Rosario — who were two of Florida’s top three scor-ers last season — to graduation, the Gators will have 
a deep backcourt in 2013-14 with the addition of 
Carter. Florida returns sharp-shooting guard Michael 
Frazier II and adds five-star signee Kasey Hill, a 
speedy point guard who thrives as a distributor. 
UF also brings back starting point guard Scottie 
Wilbekin, who was suspended indefinitely by the 
team during the summer. 
The senior will likely serve a suspension to begin 
the season, but the number of games he will sit is unknown.
Wilbekin has started working out at UF’s bas-
ketball facility but away from the team, coach Billy Donovan said in August.
Carter announced his intention to transfer to UF 
on April 30 — less than a month after Rutgers fired Rice. 
He is one of five new additions to this season’s 
roster, joining Hill, transfers Dorian Finney-Smith 
(Virginia Tech), Damontre Harris (South Carolina) 
and five-star freshman forward Chris Walker, who will miss at least the first month and a half of the season. 
Walker has not enrolled at UF yet due to academ-
ic eligibility issues but hopes to be available by late December if he enrolls in time for the 2014 spring semester.

Florida on Nov. 8.Rutgers transfer cleared to play for

“He will come in and be able to get to the 
basket a lot better than our guards have 
been able to in the past and just change

UF centerMade first start SaturdaySilver becoming playmaker
The ball barely missed the 
goal, hitting the post and flying 
out of bounds.
Silver’s play was far from sur-
prising for the Gators. 
Burleigh said her team’s out-
side backs have the ability to con-
sistently be offensive threats. 
“We are pretty aggressive 
with our outside backs,” Burleigh 
said. 
“We send them forward quite 
often. Last year we didn’t feel like we got a whole lot of produc-tion out of that, which was frus-trating because it’s a big risk to 
send them. 
“This year we’ve done much 
better picking and choosing our 
times and getting production from them.”
Silver may not have scored 
a goal this season, but she has stepped up as a playmaker for multiple Florida goals.
Silver earned two assists off 
two corner kick opportunities for goals against Florida Internation-al on Sept. 1.
She capitalized on that mo-
mentum against Oklahoma on Sept. 6, making a pass to Begic, 
who scored despite playing fewer 
than nine minutes in the game.
Silver now has four assists, 
which is just one fewer than ju-nior midfielder Annie Speese for 
the most this season.
Falknor has two assists this 
season, and junior outside back 
Tessa Andujar has two after aid-
ing junior forward Jillian Graff to 
Florida’s fourth goal against Ole Miss on Friday.
Burleigh said as consistent 
as the outside backs have been, 
there is still more for them to 
work on.
“Sometimes it’s about deci-
sions like [Sunday], (where) we 
had several chances where our 
outsides backs got in to serve balls in,” Burleigh said. 
“The good news is they’re ef-
fective in getting forward and 
now it’s just the final piece of 
that: getting the execution and obviously, the finish.”soccer , from page 12In its first game without Easley, UF 
held UK to 47 offensive plays for 173 
yards in a 24-7 victory at Commonwealth 
Stadium in Lexington, Ky. 
“We just played mad,” said Buck line-
backer Dante Fowler Jr., who contributed two sacks against Kentucky. “We just 
played for him.”
Easley previously suffered an ACL 
tear in his left knee against Florida State 
on Nov. 26, 2011, but was able to return 
for the start of the following season. 
Despite Easley having sustained two 
major knee injuries during his UF ca-reer, Muschamp expects NFL organiza-tions to remain interested in the 6-foot-2, 285-pound defensive tackle. Prior to the injury, a recent Sports Illustrated mock 
draft ranked him as the No. 15 available 
prospect. 
“He’ll have plenty of interest,” Mus-
champ said. “He’ll be a productive guy on the next level. He’s a really good foot-ball player. He’s extremely intelligent. He gets the game. 
“His tape speaks for itself and how he 
plays the game and approaches the game. He’ll be fine. There will be a lot of organi-zations that want him in their organiza-tion.”
to cornerback to safety,” defensive coordi-nator D.J. Durkin said. “There’s not many 
guys that can do that, both understanding 
the defense and being able to play in it and also have the ability level to do it. When-ever you have a guy like that, it’s really a luxury.”
At strong safety, Watkins has taken over 
for Evans, who led Florida with 83 tackles last season. 
Watkins compares nicely to Evans. 
Neither are the fastest players in the sec-
ondary. 
Neither may make a leaping intercep-
tion like Vernon Hargreaves III made 
against Kentucky, but they do their job, 
and they do it well.
A 52-yard touchdown pass from Mi-
ami’s Stephen Morris to Phillip Dorsett 
sparked the change at safety. Dorsett beat 
Maye on the play. 
Muschamp made the switch the follow-
ing Monday, saying, “You just can’t give 
up big plays. We can’t afford that to hap-
pen. You’ve got to tackle better.”
Added responsibility comes with a move 
to safety. Watkins, now making defensive 
calls, enjoyed that aspect of the move. He’s in greater command of Florida’s second-ary.
“Jaylen’s a smart football player. He knows the defense very well,” Taylor said on Sept. 17, a day after the switch. “He’ll be able to execute for us very well back there. “He’ll provide us with some big plays. 
I’m not saying that anyone else wasn’t able to, but he’ll provide us with some big plays that we need.”
While Watkins envisions a potential 
NFL career at cornerback, he’s spent an en-tire offseason preparing for the switch.
All the talk about Watkins for three 
years focused on consistency, and now re-cently how versatile the senior has become. Besides cornerback and safety, there’s a new title to add to his name — leader.
“He’s been a very vocal guy in a very 
positive way,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“He’s one of the leaders on our football 
team. I don’t think there’s any question when you walk in that locker room, the 
respect he has of his teammates and how 
he carries himself. He’s a first-class young man.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2013

Florida used its powerful offense to 
make it to the Sweet 16 last season.
UF ranked 20th in the nation in kills 
per set at 14.33 and No. 4 in the country 
with a .298 in hitting percentage.  De-
spite the lofty numbers, No. 3 Florida has found a way to improve in both categories this season. 
Thanks to help from newcomers 
and improved returners, the Gators rank No. 6 in the nation in kills per set at 14.89 and second in the nation in hit-ting percentage at .338. 
“The depth of our team is definitely 
something that is a strength this year,” assistant coach Dave Boos said. “We have a lot of players that come in and contribute — something we didn’t 
have last year.
“We were definitely a little more 
thin last year with the injury situation. 
So, it’s a nice luxury to have.”
A common theme this season has 
been the performance of different role players such as freshman right-side hitter Alex Holston and sophomore middle blocker Simone Antwi.
 Each has had breakout perfor-
mances this season, and last weekend against Mississippi State and Ole Miss was no different.
Gabby Mallette had an increased 
role during the weekend, finishing sec-ond in attempts in both games.  
She attempted 29 kills against Mis-
sissippi State and 13 against Ole Miss. 
“[Mallette’s role is] significant,” 
Boos said. 
“Championships are won and lost 
on the left side. If you look at Final Four 
and national championship teams, you 
need great left-side play.
“She has a physicality that’s very 
unique in our sport; very strong physi-
cally, a very high jumper and has tons 
of power in her swing.” 
Last season, 
Florida relied heavily on four 
of its top play-
ers — senior middle blocker Chloe 
Mann, sophomore Ziva Recek and for-mer Gators Tangerine Wiggs and Betsy 
Smith — for most of its attempts. 
Recek led UF with 1,166 attempted 
kills. Mann attempted 699, Wiggs had 
attempted 503, and Smith had 451 at-tempts.  
Mallette was the next highest at 345. 
No other player had more than 193. 
Players such as Mallette impact 
Florida’s success, in situations like the 
back-to-back sweeps to start off the 
Southeastern Conference schedule. 
“Anytime you start your SEC season 
2-0 on the road with two sweeps, you’ve got to be pleased,” Boos said. “We were 
(pleased)with what we saw.” CHUCK KINGSBURY

With Week 4 of the NFL season in 
the books, here are a few former Gators 
who made the most tangible impact for their respective teams.
Josh Evans, safety: With veter-
an safety Dwight Lowery recover-
ing from a concussion he suffered in Week 3 against the Seattle Sea-hawks, Evans filled in at starting safety for the Jacksonville Jaguars for the second consecutive Sunday 
— and he looked the part. 
An impressive showing from 
recently acquired free agent Will 
Blackmon — one interception and a sack that produced a fumble — helped shore up the league’s third worst passing defense. But Evans’ showing was equally promising. 
The former Gator combined for 
six tackles and one pass deflection while playing at both strong and free safety during the game. 
At times, Evans played single-
high safety in the Jaguars’ Cover-1 alignment but also made plays close to the line of scrimmage — a hall-mark of his style of play at Florida. 
Although he must continue to 
improve, Evans, a big, versatile safety, showed the growth and big-play ability needed to perform well at the position. 
Jeff Demps, running back:  
When Demps announced he would return to track and miss five games 
at the start of the 2013 season, the 
New England Patriots traded the Olympic runner to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Tampa added Demps to the 53-man roster on Sept. 23, taking the place of tight end Luke Stocker, who was placed on injured reserve.  
On Sunday, Demps showed off the versatility Bill Belichick was hop-ing to extract when the Patriots first signed him. Demps excelled returning kicks 
with his track-runner speed, aver-aging 23 yards per return, includ-ing a long of 29 yards. The former Gator carried the ball for 14 yards on one rush and hauled in one catch for 8 yards. With a dismal Bucs offense that 
benched its struggling quarterback in favor of unproven third-round draft pick Mike Glennon, Demps may see more touches moving for-ward. 
 Deonte Thompson, wide re-ceiver: The Baltimore Ravens have 
spent much of the off-season, pre-season and early weeks of the regu-lar season searching for playmakers to replace the production of tight end Dennis Pitta and former wide receiver Anquan Boldin.
On Sunday, quarterback Joe 
Flacco may have found one.
Former Gator Deonte Thomp-
son made his 2013 season debut after recovering from a foot injury in the preseason and made the most tangible impact of all Gators in Week 4. 
Thompson ended the game with 
four catches for 50 yards, including a 33-yard strike down the sideline in the fourth quarter. On the play, Thompson was hit helmet-to-hel-met and suffered a concussion that is not expected to cause him to miss a game.
The former Gator struggled to 
exceed expectations in Gainesville 
but showcased his adequate size 
and speed Sunday. 
With receiver Marlon Brown 
sidelined with a thigh injury and his status for Week 4 currently uncertain, Thompson could see more first-team reps during prac-tice before Sunday’s game, if he is healthy. 
Notes: Former Gator safety 
Major Wright recorded his second interception of the season for the Chicago Bears against the Detroit Lions. Chicago is fifth in the NFL in interceptions with six this season.
Redskins tight end Jordan Reed 
was sidelined for Sunday’s game versus Oakland with a thigh contu-
sion.

   With the ﬁ  rst meet of the 
season ﬁ  nished, Florida has a 
grueling schedule ahead.
  After the three-week train-
ing cycle coming up for the 
women’s team, UF will travel 
to Columbus, Mo., along with the men’s team to face Mis-souri on Oct. 17. 
Florida will then travel to 
compete against California — the 2011 and 2012 national champions — just two days later.
  The rigorous road test is fol-
lowed by a home meet against Georgia, which has won four straight Southeastern Confer-ence championships and the 2013 NCAA title. 
Coach Gregg Troy is fo-
cused on what needs to be ﬁ  xed during the three-week interval.
  “On the women’s side, we 
exposed some weaknesses,” 
Troy said. 
“We’ve got some depth is-
sues and some things we have 
to work on, but overall the competition was good. We won a lot of events. The wom-en raced very tough.”
  Troy was critical of the 
team’s turns at the walls 
and technical issues such as 
streamlines and breakouts.  “Early season when you’re 
training, those things we don’t spend quite as much time on,” Troy said. 
“We’ve talked about it, but 
the rehearsal of them probably isn’t good. Some of it could be from fatigue, some of it could be early season. It will be 
highlighted even more as the 
level of competition steps up a notch.”  
  However, UF’s main focus 
is to get into shape at the right time.
  “There’s nothing in swim-
ming that really matters ‘till February and March,” Troy 
said, alluding to both the SEC 
and NCAA championships.   Florida wins season-opening meet

   The picture is starting to come 
into focus.
  Last Friday, Florida’s men com-
peted in their ﬁ  nal event leading 
up to the Wisconsin adidas Invi-
tational. 
  Prior to Friday’s FLRunners.
com Invitational in Titusville, 
coach Paul Spangler said this meet was essentially an audition de-signed to solidify the Gators’ top seven runners for Wisconsin.
    Freshman Carlos Miranda 
earned one of those spots. 
Miranda tallied his ﬁ  rst colle-
giate victory on Friday in the 5K with a time of 15:17.60. 
At UF’s previous meet, the 
Mountain Dew Invitational, Miranda drew praise from Span-gler after running a personal best at the Mark Bostick Golf Course, which is known as one of the more 
difﬁ  cult courses in the NCAA due 
to its uneven terrain. 
  “Last year, everybody’s PRs 
came out of pre-nationals in Louis-ville,” Spangler said. “That course is ﬂ  at. Our course is pretty tough, so if you ran a lifetime PR out here, that’s pretty dang good.”
  JRedshirt freshmen Elliot Clem-
ente and Mac Reynolds and soph-omore Harsha Torke, who ﬁ  n-ished in second, third, and fourth, 
respectively, joined Miranda in the 
top ﬁ  ve. 
  “It was a solid race for the men, 
with Carlos winning,” Spangler said. “It was a great victory for him, as he also won here last year in high school. Carlos, Mac, Elliot and Harsha worked together most of the race. Carlos did an excellent job holding of a challenge from the runner-up in the ﬁ  nal 400m of the race this evening.”
  After redshirting his ﬁ  rst year, 
Clemente is excited to be back in the fold. He placed second Friday 
and has a chance to make the top 
seven in Wisconsin. 
  “Not being 
able to run last year was deﬁ  -nitely a down-
er,” Clemente said. “Coming in my freshman 
year, I wasn’t 
able to be part of the top seven 
or travel with the squad. This year, now that I’m part of it, it’s deﬁ  nite-ly a lot of fun.”
  Moving forward, Spangler has 
the task of determining who exact-ly will ﬁ  ll out the top seven. 
Spangler had said earlier last 
week that the men’s top four was set. Mark Parrish, Jimmy Clark, J.L. Hines and Eddie Garcia com-prise the group. 
  In two weeks, the women 
will compete in the Disney Cross Country Classic in Orlando with the hopes of solidifying their top 
seven for Wisconsin, too. 
While the men’s squad is 
healthy and deep, the women’s 
squad has been compromised early this season by injuries and sickness.
