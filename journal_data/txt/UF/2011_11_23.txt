  At the corner of University 
Avenue and NW 13th Street, inside the Holiday Inn, on 
a lime green chair in the lobby, sits Kim Layton, class of ’85. Kim is a former military brat, moved around a lot as a kid, came to UF in part be-cause no one knew her. She stayed in town 13 years. 
  Now, she works as a paralegal 
outside Atlanta, but she owns sea-
son tickets. She is in Gainesville to-day to see Florida play Furman with her husband, Skip, and another cou-ple. Last night, they ate at Leonar-do’s Pizza. They also shopped at the UF Bookstore in the Reitz Union.
  Kim shopped for her brother, 
Scott, an alumnus and a Phi Delta Theta. Her sister, Tamara, was a Delta Delta Delta. Kim was a Phi Mu. She and Skip picked up car dec-orations, shirts and Christmas orna-ments. Every time she is in town, Kim shops.
  “You’ve got to,” she says. Kim, 48, is a pale woman with 
glasses and short, auburn hair. She is wearing a blue-and-white check-ered button down with a small Gators logo on the chest. 
“You gotta come down and see 
all the old buildings and feel con-nected to the school. We’re still con-nected.”
  Those ties, pulling thousands 
of alumni back to Gainesville for a handful of weekends each year, provide a boost to local businesses, even when the economy is down, even when the Gators are worse.   In 2009, home football games 
generated about $106 million in the economy, according to a study by UF’s Institute of Food and Agri-cultural Sciences. Football doesn’t create nearly as much money as the university’s healthcare services or day-to-day operations do, both of which generate north of $2 billion annually. But those things go on all year. Football is for seven week-ends.
  The team’s 6-5 record has sus-
pended interest and, to a degree, sales, though the extent of that af-fect is only subjective. 
Early afternoon games lead to 
less money, as do opponents from college football’s cellar. If Florida is playing at noon, a lot of fans will drive to and from Gainesville on Saturday rather than stay at a ho-tel, which often demands customers pay for two nights, says John Prich-er, tourism development director for Alachua County Visitors and Convention Bureau.  
  The Swamp Restaurant saw sig-
niﬁ  cantly less customers for last Saturday’s 1 p.m. game than it normally does, ofﬁ  ce manager Is-rael Mendez said. And of 24 hotels called, including the Holiday Inn, only the 36-room Reitz Union Hotel was booked 10 days before the FSU game.
  Still, football season is busier 
than any other time. Among those 24 hotels, the median cost for a room with two beds for Saturday’s game against Florida State is $189 — an 82 percent hike from a non-football weekend.
  And even though sellouts have 
been inconsistent this year, fan support has not fallen off dramati-cally: average attendance has only dropped 2 percent compared with the previous two seasons. Some business owners say the team’s per-formance isn’t as important as the time of the game — Florida hasn’t played a primetime home game since its Oct. 1 clash with Alabama. This Saturday’s game kicks off at 7 p.m.
  But regardless of the time, re-
gardless of Florida’s record, regard-less of the attendance drop and fan expectations and the opponent, game days are still better than any other Saturday.
  
    
  It is a little after 10 a.m., and 
while Kim chats in the Holiday Inn lobby, Troop 614 Scoutmaster Jason Chamberlain directs cars into the open lot on t h e other s i d e o f 1 3 t h Street. Chamberlain and a group of volunteers in matching orange shirts are selling spots for $20 each, with proceeds going to the local boy scouts chapter. On an average game day, they sell 450 spots. 
Going west on University Ave-
nue, about 10 people pace back and forth for three blocks, tickets held above their heads. Open-market scalping laws have been in place in Florida since 2006. Standing in front of the Gator Wesley Center, two men hold signs advertising tickets for sale. A group of ﬁ  ve fans walk by. Nobody takes the bait.
“Too many motherf***** seats 
today,” says an old white man in calf-high tube socks, muddy New Balances and a trucker hat.
“I still got six,” a bulky black 
man in dreadlocks and sunglasses replies.
  Three blocks over, at the Florida 
Book Store across from Keene-Flint Hall, DJ Eff-150 from 100.5 The Buzz is roasting Furman fans from atop the store’s overhang while “Can’t Stop” by the Red Hot Chili Peppers plays. 
Fridays on game weekends are 
twice as proﬁ  table as on other week-ends, assistant store manager Taryn Emswiler says, Sundays three times as much. Saturdays, of course, are the busiest days.
  I n 
t h e park-ing lot to the l e f t , B e t h 
R o m a n o and her mother, Sue Montgom-
ery, sit behind three tables display-ing homemade beaded earrings, necklaces and bracelets. 
On the other side of the lot, Jac-
quelyn Brooks sits at a register holding Jo Jo, her black Jack Russell Terrier-Chihuahua mix. Jacquelyn had never sold her dresses, skirts and hair berets on game days before this season, and she says Saturdays are twice as productive as any other day.
  Jacquelyn’s back is to 101 Can-
tina, where an outdoor tailgate with seven bars, a stage and a sound sys-tem has been set up — home games pay the bills for the whole year, bar-tender Tyler Fawbush says. 
Dee Dee Ricks, class of ’90 and the 
subject of a recent HBO documen-tary, is at the entrance promoting a cancer awareness non-proﬁ  t when a woman in a gray Gators sweatshirt approaches her. The woman is talk-ing and laughing and nodding her head all at once. She recognizes Dee Dee from TV .
  On the other side of NW 17th 
Street, UF Plaza looks like a mar-ket. Gator Shop has erected a pair of tents covering its merchandise: sweatshirts, T-shirts, hats, license plates, lanyards. The works. 
At the Copper Monkey tent, 
employees are setting up six tables while a sign advertises cheeseburg-ers and fries and liquor and Jell-O shots and beer. 
In front of Relish stands a bou-
quet of 136 beer cans: Heineken, Bud Light, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Stella Artois. 
  “It’s like a parking lot party,” 
Gator Shop co-owner Joi Bass says.Even with a bad team, alumni still shop because they can’t ﬁ  nd Florida gear back home, she says.
  A couple doors down, about 25 
people are drinking in the Salty Dog Saloon. An hour from now, the place will be more crowded. An hour ear-lier, the doors had just opened and general manager Keith Singleton was confused. He had been at the bar since 7:30 the night before.
  “Who am I supposed to be call-
ing?” he asked a female employee, small bags under his eyes.
  “Chris,” the woman said.  “He’s missing out on so much 
business right now,” Keith respond-ed, dryly.  
  The bar is empty at 9 a.m., save 
for a couple other workers. Keith says he doesn’t know why Salty Dog opens so early. He used to be doing game-day shots with the regulars at 9 a.m. But the regulars graduated, and nobody took their place. He blames President Ber-nie Machen, who raised admission standards and weeded out the Salty Dog crowd. 
  “It’s nothing like it used to be. I’m 
the manager; I don’t deal with cus-tomers as much as the rest of these guys,” he said, eyeing the rest of the workers. “Really, I mostly have to deal with people who are getting in ﬁ  ghts, getting thrown out. That nev-er happens anymore. That’s good, I guess. But still, this place is nothing like it used to be.”
  Two doors down, Balls experi-
ences a similar trafﬁ  c ﬂ  ow: empty at 9, small group at 10, crowded by 11. 
  At Italian Gator, the usual two-
person crew in the cramped quar-ters is replaced by an assembly line of four or ﬁ  ve workers, none of them moving more than two feet to either side as they relay slices and pies to each other. 
Today’s game won’t be as prof-itable as next week’s, general man-ager Damon Bailey says. Even so, the price for a slice is 50 cents more than a normal day, and sales usu-ally double.
  The sidewalk at midtown is 
crowded. Fans, scalpers and ven-dors are walking toward the sta-dium. 
Past XS, past Gator City, past 
Dunkin Donuts and another mer-chandise tent and the St. Augus-tine’s Church, where the Catholic Gators Student Ministries are sell-ing hats and T-shirts and hoodies — “Real Champions Pray!” 
  Past a tent selling Italian sausage, 
polish sausage, cheesesteaks. Past Lulu’s Fresh-Squeezed Lemonade booth. Past the eight-story condo project still under construction. Past the Delta Upsilon house and Uni-versity Lutheran. 
As the game draws closer, scalp-
ers become desperate — doesn’t anyone want this ticket?
  
  
    Next to the Pi Kappa Alpha house, 
facing Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, inside the white tent with ﬁ  ve Gators ﬂ  ags on top, Henry Cummings watches fans shop. He has been here since 8 a.m.
  Cummings, 59, is a tall black gentle-
man with a gray goatee. He ran track at Florida from 1971-74, and he has been working at Jacksonville-based Sports Mania for ﬁ  ve years. 
He will keep the portable store 
open for about two hours after Satur-day’s game. He usually does. 
Like most vendors, though, he is 
looking forward to next week. More people will be here. He will sell Florida State gear, too. And after night games, he sometimes gets to open back up on Sunday mornings. 
  Business is never really that bad, 
though, he says. Sports Mania makes between $5,000-$15,000 each Satur-day. 
Inside the tent, one girl walks 
out with a pack of wristbands, and a woman shows off some blue Gators slippers.
  “People are gonna shop, regard-
less,” Cumming says. “This is the Gators we’re talkin’ about.”

  Law enforcement ofﬁ  cials will be out in 
full force Saturday for the annual UF-Flori-
da State University football game. 
  The University Police are teaming up, as 
usual, with the Gainesville Police, Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce and Florida High-way Patrol for gameday, said Maj. Brad Bar-ber, UPD public information ofﬁ  cer. 
  Between 250 and 300 ofﬁ  cers patrol typi-
cal gamedays, but a full force of about 300 ofﬁ  cers are working this Saturday’s game, he said.   “We still recognize that this is a very 
competitive and heated rivalry game,” he said, “and given that it is also a night game, we’re preparing for it accordingly.”
  During rivalry Gator football games this 
season, ofﬁ  cials have made more arrests and ejected more people from Ben Hill Grif-ﬁ  n Stadium than during non-rivalry ones, according to UPD news releases about home games.  
  For example, 15 people were ejected at 
the UF-Furman University game Saturday, and 102 people were ejected and seven were UPD to up security Saturday

  Peter Andriotis spent Tuesday 
afternoon on the highway, but he 
couldn’t set his car in cruise con-trol like he usually does.
  Andriotis, a 20-year-old an-
thropology junior, is among those who left Gainesville to spend Thanksgiving with family and friends. 
Like other students, he faced 
holiday traffic.
  “It’s not terrible, but it’s no-
ticeable,” said Andriotis, who drove to Tampa.
  Chip Skinner, city pub-
lic works spokesman, said the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are normally days with heavy traffic, particularly on Archer Road and Newberry Road as people head to Interstate 75.
  For drivers who want to avoid 
heavy traffic when leaving town, he suggests taking Williston Road and avoid driving toward I-75 during the afternoon and early evening. 
He said traffic during the days 
before Thanksgiving usually lightens up around 7 p.m.
  Friday is generally the best day 
to return to Gainesville to avoid heavy traffic, Skinner said.
  People will be on the road Fri-
day in order to get to Gainesville in time for the game against FSU, but the roads will still be clear-er than Saturday or Sunday, he said.
  On Saturday, he recommends 
getting on the road early. 
Around 4 p.m., drivers who 
live in Orlando and other nearby cities will hit the road, making traffic worse.
  “Saturday will definitely be 
worse than Friday,” he said. “It’s going to be very busy on Sun-day.”

Team in Transit, a student documentary project about what goes into transporting the football team to away 
games, will premiere throughout Thanksgiving weekend.

In 60 minutes, the Gators 
football team produces 80 
pounds of dirty clothes.
For one away game, 200 
sets of uniforms for 70 players must be transported.
Nike provides each Gators 
player with five different styles of cleats.
Thirteen UF students and 
two UF professors spent their semester working on a proj-ect to explain, using multime-dia, everything that goes into transporting the Gators foot-ball team to an away game.
“It doesn’t all magically 
appear,” said Jillian Rogers, a 22-year-old journalism senior and external communications coordinator for the project. 
The group is premiering its 
project, called Team in Transit, online throughout the Thanks-giving holiday weekend.
The group decided to docu-
ment this season’s trip to Au-burn University.
The website, teamintran-
sit.com, will have videos and photos from the trip to Au-burn, Ala., on Oct. 15.
Most of the students who 
worked on the project are in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. The project is the first to come out of the college’s 21st Century News Laboratory.
“This is the start of what’s 
to come,” Rogers said.

Scientists used the same statistics that de-
cide your “suggested friends” on Facebook 
to predict how well an endangered species population can travel from one habitat to the next.
The study, performed by scientists at UF’s 
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences,  tested statistical models and compared them to actual movements of species.
For example, if you have a friend who has 
a friend, statistical models can predict the likelihood that you know that third person, determining “suggested friends,” said Brian Reichert, a graduate research assistant and Ph.D. candidate who worked on the study.
Instead of using friends, the study took 
potential habitats of an endangered species and used the social network model to predict where a species would move. The ability to move, called connectivity, can help a species survive.The predictions were very accurate when 
compared to the true movements a species made. 
“Connectivity affects the long-term per -
sistence of a population,” Reichert said. “If a population is well-connected and can move throughout points easily, there’s a chance it can interbreed better and be healthier. If it can’t get from place to place, it will go ex-tinct.”

� THE 700-ACRE FIRE IS ABOUT 35 
MILES EAST OF GAINESVILLE
MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida Highway Patrol closed a couple of 
roads temporarily Tuesday due to a dangerous 
combination of fog and smoke from a brush fire that started more than a week ago.
U.S. 301 was closed between State Road 20 and 
State Road 26, and State Road 20 was closed from U.S. 301 to Putnam County. Florida Forest Ser-vice is calling the brush fire, which closed roads due to visibility problems, the Olive Fire. The fire started about 35 miles east of Gainesville.
“This morning they had to close … a pretty 
broad section of 301, which can make a huge dif-ference to people commuting to work, to school, for truckers [and] for people traveling through the area trying to get somewhere for the holi-days,” said Ludie Bond, wildfire mitigation spe-cialist for the Florida Forest Service. 
The roads were opened later that afternoon. The Florida Forest Service first responded  on 
Nov. 15 to the fire, which started in Levy Prai-rie, just east of the Alachua-Putnam county line, Bond said.
It has grown to about 700 acres, and 70 percent 
of it is contained, but the fire is still going. It has caused closures on State Road 20 and State Road 21 in the Interlachen, Hawthorne and Melrose ar-eas, according to a news release. 
The scent of smoke was noticeable through 
most of Alachua County during the weekend as winds blew in from the east. 
Florida Highway Patrol posted smoke warn-
ing signs on roads as a caution to drivers. 
Bond said some rain Tuesday around the fire-
affected area helped with smoke management. A perimeter has been set up around the fire where tractors plowed the ground down to contain the flames.Roads were closed because of smoke
Ticket scalping could cause problems
arrested at the UF-University of Alabama game. 
Kickoff for the UF-FSU game will be at 7 p.m. 
Liquor law violations are among the most com-
mon gameday issues. As police have done through-out the football season, they will issue civil citations to people who violate open-container laws at the stadium, Barber said. 
Anyone younger than 21 in possession of alco-
hol will be given a notice to appear in court. People stopped for driving under the influence are usually arrested.
Ticket scalping could be a problem on Saturday,

Grooveshark: Claims based on false, anonymous blog comment
for each infringed piece of work.
Grooveshark responded to the allegations in an offi-
cial statement.
“Universal’s claims rest almost entirely on an anon-
ymous, blatantly false Internet blog comment and Uni-
versal’s gross mischaracterization of information that Grooveshark itself provided to Universal,” the statement read.The complaint, which is the first step in a lawsuit, in-
cludes emails from Sina Simantob, who is identified in them as the Escape Media Group executive chairman. 
Universal Music Group stated the emails prove 
Grooveshark knew it was taking songs without permis-sion.
The anonymous comment was posted to a blog, Digi-
tal Music News, and comes from a self-identified Groove-shark employee.
“We are assigned a predetermined ammount (sic) of weekly uploads to the system and get a small extra bonus if we manage to go above that,” stated the comment from “Visitor.”
The person refused to give his or her identity when 
pushed by other people who commented on the blog post.
According to Grooveshark’s statement, the company 
feels it will prevail in the suit.
Grooveshark continues to run its website. Groove-
shark.com boasts 30 million monthly active users.GROOVESHARK , from page 1 WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5
HEALTH
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thank Maci, Farrah and the other stars of MTV’s “Teen 
Mom” — they may be the reason teen pregnancy rates are 
decreasing.
According to a report by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, teen birth rates in the U.S. dropped last year to the lowest they have been in about 70 years. 
Teen birth rates have been decreasing for the past three 
years. Since peaking in 1991, they have dropped 44 per -
cent.
MTV shows such as “16 and Pregnant” and “Teen 
Mom” depict the realities of being a pregnant teenager and a young mother.
These scenarios could encourage teenagers to think 
critically about the consequences of pregnancy, said Bruce Floyd, social media specialist for UF University Relations.
“Footage shown from the MTV shows could help edu-
cate people how teen pregnancy is not glamorous and can change your life dramatically,” Floyd said.
In 2010, there were 34.3 births per 1,000 teenagers and 
young adults ages 15-19, according to a Nov. 17 Reuters article. That’s a 9 percent drop from the previous year. In 2009, the rate was 39.1 births per 1,000 women in that age group.
Social media platforms could have also contributed to 
the lower teen pregnancy rate, Floyd said.
Facebook and Twitter can be effective because they al-low people to engage in dialogue and help organizations connect with their followers.
The CDC has a special link for social media and 
teen pregnancy on its website. Among other features, links and images to promote talking to teens about sex or preventing teen pregnancy are on the website.  
CDC website visitors also can post cut-and-paste messag-es on their Facebook pages, providing information on teen pregnancy prevention.
Staci Fox, CEO of Planned Parenthood of North Florida, 
said she thinks social media helps prevent teen pregnancy because it allows young adults to speak in a familiar and comfortable medium. Teenagers can still speak with their partners about sex and protection without having to be face to face, which can make it less awkward. 
She also said TV shows that display teen parenthood 
could help prevent unplanned pregnancy.
“At first, as a movement we were worried exposure 
would sensationalize the issue,” she said, “but instead it has brought it home for teens.”
Campus and local sex education programs also could have contributed to lower teen pregnancy rates.
Educating teenagers on safe sex measures like birth 
control gives them the tools to prevent pregnancy, said Sa-mantha Evans, sexual health educator for GatorWell.
Evans said she likes to teach all methods of prevention, 
not just abstinence but also barrier methods, hormonal contraceptives and emergency contraceptives. She teaches to large groups of students in classrooms and organiza-tions, and she advises students one-on-one or in couples. 
Fox said she thinks sex education has come a long 
way. 
Schools supporting teenagers after they become preg-
nant or give birth could be another contributor to the low-er teen pregnancy rate. 
Eastside High School is re-implementing a program 
after January called Partners in Adolescent Life Sup-port, or PALS, school nurse Georgianna Beveridge said.  The program will serve as a support group for students who are pregnant or have had a child, she said. 
The goal is to teach the students to prevent any future 
pregnancies they could have while they are still teenag-ers.
Fox thinks teen pregnancy happens when teenagers 
can’t communicate about sex and can’t get access to pre-ventative measures. 
While she said she thinks teen pregnancy will continue 
its decline, she thinks the issue will never be eradicated because there will always be teens who can’t get the help they need to prevent getting pregnant.Social media, reality TV could help reduce teen pregnancies
“Footage shown from the MTV shows could 
help educate people how teen pregnancy 
is not glamorous and can change your life                 
dramatically.”

Assad’s resignation not the answer for Syria
On Nov. 12, the Arab League voted to suspend 
Syria from further involvement with the Arab-state coalition until the bloodshed soaking the 
country ceases.
Just days after the announcement, King Abdullah II 
of Jordan called for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down.
“Whenever you exert violence on your own people, 
it is never going to end well,” Abdullah said, the first Arab leader to call for Assad’s resignation.
There is no doubt that Assad’s violence against his 
own people is an atrocious act against humanity, but is the immediate resignation of Assad the best option for Syria and the rest of the Arab world?
Assad has to be removed from power, but a quick 
transition of power is not in Syria’s best interest, espe-cially if those dying are doing so in the name of democ-racy and transparency.
As we’ve seen in the cases of Iraq and Afghanistan, 
democracy can take a lot of time and effort to imple-ment. 
It’s not just a system of elections; democracy requires 
an entire shifting of the national thought process.
Yes, elections are necessary, but they’re not suffi-
cient. Institutions need to be put in place, the market economy needs to be redefined and corruption needs to be erased. 
All these things take time to do, and a quick replace-
ment of Assad doesn’t ensure that Syrians will be better off.
While the majority of the population in Syria is 
Sunni, there is still a significant population of Shiites, namely President Assad himself, as well as millions of Iraqi refugees.
Iran, a Shiite-dominant country and home for Shiite 
terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, will undoubtedly lobby for Assad to stay in power. In the instance he is ousted, 
Hezbollah and Iran will probably do whatever it takes to maintain their influence in the region.
Any skeptic of religion’s role in the matter should 
look at the Arab League voting results.
All but three countries voted for Syria’s suspension: 
Lebanon, which is run by the terrorist group Hezbollah; Yemen, which has close ties to Iran and has a significant Shiite minority; and Iraq, which abstained from the vote (most likely for the reasons mentioned above).
If anything, Assad’s refusal to step down is giving 
appropriate and much-needed time for his opposition to centralize itself.
While Assad’s resignation remains unlikely, conces-
sions might be a more viable option, especially in light of Turkey’s call for Assad’s resignation. 
Turkey, currently supplying Syria with power, has 
threatened to cut them off.
Contrary to what the media and some internation-
al organizations have been saying, Assad does have a place in Syria and is a necessary part of the country’s transition to democracy.
Assad needs to open up the floor to dialogue and 
create a committee dedicated to a new constitution and election policies. 
I’m sure Assad would like to live peacefully in Syria 
to a ripe age, but at this rate, Assad’s fate will be similar to that of Mubarak or even Gaddafi.
History will remember Assad as the stubborn tyrant 
who killed 3,500 of his own people, but he still has the opportunity to save face and show the world that de-mocracy can exist in the Middle East.
The time for amends is now.Ryan Campbell is a columnist for The Maine Campus at 
the University of Maine. Lying about Liberty
Republicans need to 
do some re-evaluating
Most conservative Republican candidates claim 
that they believe in individual liberty and freedom — at least when it’s convenient.  
A closer examination of the policies supported by Republi-cans, specifically candidates in the current presidential race, tells another story. 
Of course, topping the list is the candidate that signed a 
law mandating (through force of law) that citizens of Mas-sachusetts purchase health insurance. Mitt Romney has also offered a solution to immigration in the form of a national biometric ID card that all Americans will use to prove their citizenship in order to obtain a job. Romney claimed that only immigrants will have to carry this card, but how are employers supposed to know the difference unless every-one has one? 
Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed a law mandating that 
girls in his state obtain a vaccination for HPV. While the vaccine does not cause “mental retardation,” the mandate exemplifies another impediment of individual liberty.  
Then you have Michele Bachmann, who is just so upset that roughly 53 percent of Americans pay almost no income tax-es. Well, there is also the payroll tax, FICA, state sales taxes, state income taxes, excise taxes and user fees for obtaining a number of government services, but that’s not enough for Bachmann. She thinks that every American needs to pay at least some federal income tax — or else. 
Of course there are issues on which almost all Republi-
cans, with a few exceptions, fall against the side of liberty. 
Most of the candidates support the Defense of Marriage 
Act as well as a constitutional amendment defining mar -
riage as between a man and a woman. If you were really concerned about freedom, you wouldn’t be trying to tell people with whom they can and cannot form a voluntary agreement.
On the same accord, most mainstream conservatives ab-
hor the idea of legalizing drugs. They do not support the decriminalization of marijuana, a stance that has become in-creasingly popular among Americans. 
The classic Republican cop-out to opposing increasing 
social freedom is states’ rights. Most responses sound like “Well, I wouldn’t support that on the federal level, but I think states should be able to decide on the issue.” But if you truly support “freedom,” should individual rights not trump those of the states? 
When it comes down to it, these candidates should be 
held accountable for their claims supporting individual lib-erty. 
This is not to say that the Democrats are any better when 
it comes to violating freedom. But the Democrats are not making contradictory assertions about their policy goals. 
Republicans should either re-evaluate their policy posi-
tions or change the way they frame the debate. 
At the end of the day, nothing supports the idea that they 
are lovers of liberty and freedom.

City regulations reflect growth 
 I am a second-year law student 
and lifelong Gainesville resident. I 
think you should publish some coun-terpoints to Travis Hornsby’s column about city ordinances.
  Until recently , a growing student 
population at the university has driv-en development in Gainesville. Be-cause the UF student population has stopped growing, the city must now refocus its efforts on retaining students after they graduate. 
  We need jobs and we need a com-
munity that makes talented graduates want to stay. That is what Innovation Square and our land development code are all about.
  Development regulation could cer-
tainly be streamlined in terms of proce-dure, but the substantial requirements of our planning documents reﬂ  ect the type of community that I believe will attract and retain both businesses and our alumni. They reﬂ  ect a shift from Cabana Beach to less auto-dependent projects like The Continuum in a vi-brant downtown.
  In Portland, Ore., a streetcar sys-tem stimulated more than $2 billion dollars in development within a re-development district. RTS is pursuing funding to establish a transit system in Gainesville. Can you imagine the impact of a streetcar route from down-town to campus along Southwest Sec-ond Avenue?
  As for our taxes, Alachua County 
ranks below the state average in terms of total property taxes levied per cap-ita. That is a fact that might be even more surprising in light of the fact that much of the most valuable property in the county — the UF campus — is off the tax rolls. Unlike many other coun-ties in the state, Alachua County has no local option sales tax dedicated to transportation. We make up for that with a higher millage rate.
  Our leaders in local government 
are taking the steps necessary to en-sure continued economic growth in Gainesville. We should not allow that progress to be derailed by hyperbolic arguments and conspiracy theories.

Letter to the Editor
  There are very few people who would argue America is a huge fan of communism.
  After half a century of political tension 
and some propaganda, it isn’t too surprising. 
  Whether it was truly communism doesn’t 
make a difference — the damage has been done to the American psyche. This is obvious when you hear those on the right decrying some of the left’s actions because they’re “communist.” The intent is to merely connect it with something most Americans despise.
  So, it’s surprising to ﬁ  nd something Ameri-
cans like even less than communism: Congress.
  According to a recent Gallup poll, Congress’ 
approval rating is sitting at only 13 percent, con-tinuing a historic low point in popularity. Be-cause it is so unpopular, some have taken it upon themselves to compare this to the popularity of other subjects.
  One such person is Senator Michael Bennet, 
D-Colo., who created a chart to help explain just how low these numbers are. Although Gallup puts Congress’ popularity at 13 percent, Bennet uses a recent New York Times/CBS poll which found it at 9 percent.
  As previously mentioned, one of the subjects was communism — spe-ciﬁ  cally America becom-ing communist. Accord-ing to a Rasmussen poll performed this year, 11 
percent of people polled were OK with the idea of America going communist.
  If that doesn’t cause a surprise, some of the 
other numbers should help. After the oil spill in the Gulf, BP stood at 16 percent approval. Nixon held 24 percent during Watergate, and banks were still hovering at 23 percent as of this year, all according to Gallup polls.
  Clearly , Congress isn’t very popular right 
now.  
  While these are numbers Congress should 
heed, they are not things to which we should lend much weight.   Despite some people saying they dislike Congress just because it’s a popular viewpoint, the low numbers seem far more likely an indication of faulty polling.
    Twenty-ﬁ  ve percent isn’t asking much. If 
Nixon and the banks can pull it off, surely this Congress should be able to as well.

� UF WON 63-46 AT HOME.
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
   
 After a disappointing performance 
in a season-opening loss to Michigan, 
Florida junior forward Jennifer George knew something had to change. Now, with three additional games on the stat sheet, it’s looking like the transfor-mation didn’t take long.
  “I just had a different mentality ,” 
she said. “In the Michigan game, that wasn’t me. I had to come out and be more consistent for our team and just play better.”
  On Tuesday night, George record-
ed her ﬁ  fth career double-double with 13 points and 14 rebounds to lead UF (3-1) to a 63-46 win against Hampton (2-1) in the O’Connell Center.
  The Gators’ win was a reversal of 
last year’s outcome when they trav-eled to Virginia to play the Pirates and lost a ﬁ  rst-half lead as part of a disap-pointing defeat.
  Tuesday’s ﬁ  rst half was not for the 
faint-hearted. Florida stumbled out of the gates with its worst half of shoot-ing of the young season. The Gators shot just 25 percent from the ﬁ  eld and fell behind 12-2 early, shooting an ane-mic 0 for 9 from beyond the arc and just 50 percent from the free-throw line.
  Florida turned the ball over on its 
ﬁ  rst three possessions and didn’t reg-ister a basket until its ﬁ  fth possession. 
  “It was the play of Lanita Bartley ,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “Not that the three turnovers were all her fault, but I put a lot of responsibility on our point guards and didn’t think she set the tone for us the way that we all know she’s capable of.”
  Luckily for UF, Hampton was 
struggling with many of the same is-sues. While the Pirates made 2 of 4 from three and were perfect from the charity stripe, they managed to shoot just 27.6 percent from the ﬁ  eld, col-lapsing toward the end of the half to let the Gators back in the game.
  Florida came out with a renewed 
focus in the second half due in large part to smarter play by Bartley. In-stead of three turnovers, the team had six points and a 26-22 lead after its ﬁ  rst three possessions. 
  George took over in the second 
half, racking up eight points and eight rebounds to cap a stretch in which she has scored double digits in three straight games for the ﬁ  rst time in her UF career.
  After providing a defensive boost 
in the ﬁ  rst half en route to a four-block performance, center Azania Stewart chimed in after the break with eight points after she was held scoreless in the opening 20 minutes of play.
  “[It’s] just good timing and good 
defense and just staying disciplined,” Stewart said.
  Florida’s offense picked up, with 
the exception of a woeful three-point shooting performance. While it was Jordan Jones in the ﬁ  rst half, Jaterra Bonds and Brittany Shine took the load in the second half, combining to go 1 for 7 as part of a 6.7 team shooting percentage from long-range.
  “We know that we’re a good 
shooting team, but we also know that that’s not why we’re going to win ball games,” Butler said. “We know we’re capable. We also know we’re capable of missing a lot of shots.”    WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 13

NATION IN THREES.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Through four games this 
season, it has been easy to 
guess where the Gators are going to find their offense. 
On 108 shots, Florida’s 47 
made threes are the second most in the nation, trailing only Purdue’s 50.
But while long-range 
shots again made up the ma-jority of UF’s field goals in a 78-65 win against Wright State on Monday, they didn’t allow Florida to pull away from an overmatched opponent.
“There’s a real fine bal-
ance there,” Donovan said. “In the second half we were way too predictable on of-fense.”
After being outscored 
by the Raiders 36-34 in the final 20 minutes, Donovan called the Gators “stagnant” and “easy to guard” due to a lack of awareness of both their opposition’s foul trou-ble and his own players’ shot selection.
Though Florida led by as 
many as 16 points earlier in the second half, Wright State was able to cut the deficit to nine with five minutes left to play. The Gators hoisted 11 of 19 shots beyond the arc after halftime and made just four.
“Erving (Walker) had 
a wide-open look on the break and it rattled in and out, and then the next pos-session, (Mike) Rosario comes down, the ball gets thrown to him, and he lets one go that’s kind of a half-way decent shot,” Donovan said. “We just shot a three, we missed it, we had a pret-ty good look. Put the ball on the floor a little bit.”
As Florida’s starting 
point guard, Walker had nine points on 1-of-6 shoot-ing from behind the arc, the second-most attempts be-hind Kenny Boynton’s 22 points on nine threes. 
While Donovan said 
We here at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column are feeling the holiday spirit.
We may be spread thin with ev-
erything we have on our plates this season (and surely even more on them Thursday), but we still have plenty to be thankful for this Thanksgiving.
A few days off from the daily 
grind? Yep.
A chance to see our families and 
loved ones? You know it.
The obscene feast of turkey, 
stuffing, delicious side dishes and pumpkin pie awaiting each of us on Thursday? Damn straight.
But there’s one thing we are espe-
cially thankful for this year: college football rivalries.
Nothing quite rings in the begin-
ning of the holiday season like some historic — and hate-filled –—col-lege rivalries. State and regional bragging rights are on the line all across the nation this weekend. And if that’s not enough to get you am-ped up, how could you forget some of the awesome rivalry trophies at stake?
So with that in mind, we let two 
of our columnists debate one of this weekend’s healthy rivalries.
Virginia Tech (-5) will feast on 
Virginia because…
The Hokies are going to win this 
one for the millions of turkeys sac-rificed on Thanksgiving this year. Why Virginia Tech’s mascot is a tur -
key is anyone’s guess, but this is one group of turkeys that will thrive this weekend.
Aside from not being served on 
a plate, the Hokies have something else to be thankful for: their domi-nance against the Cavaliers. Since Virginia Tech joined the Atlantic Coast Conference the  Hokies are 7-0 against their in-state rivals.
That won’t change this weekend.Picks

While many volleyball teams around 
the NCAA have already wrapped up their 
regular seasons, Florida’s players have one last test against South Carolina tonight in the O’Connell Center before they can enjoy a quick Thanksgiving break.
Then the Gators can get back to what 
they’ve been preparing for all year long — the postseason.
“We’re kind of excited,” freshman de-
fensive specialist Holly Pole said. “It’s our last home game and whatnot and then we’ll all have Thanksgiving, but it’s definitely good that we get to play this one last game, where as a lot of teams around the country are already done. We’re just ready to get out there and give it our best effort.”
After sweeps of Georgia and Auburn 
at home last weekend, the Gators’ match against the Gamecocks will be the final step in their confidence-building finish before 
the NCAA Tournament.
And that’s exactly what 
coach Mary Wise had planned for this three-game stretch. 
One last win against 
South Carolina will be important in determining Florida’s seed in postsea-
son play.
“Our goal is just like [last] weekend,” 
Wise said. “Because neither of those teams would be regionally ranked, it was really important that we beat them, so we’re play-ing for a lot [tonight] besides it just being the regular end of the season.”
When the Gators traveled to South Caro-
lina earlier this season, Florida’s 3-0 victory was one of the last before a shaky stretch of losses stripped UF of its chance to play for the Southeastern Conference title.
“We kind of let off the gas a little bit, 
especially that weekend at Kentucky and Tennessee, but since then we’ve really been playing a lot of 6-on-6 in the gym and com-petition drills and games,” Pole said. “I think it’s really helped us become a better competitive team.”

Virginia (+5) will eat all the leftovers this weekend 
because...
This ain’t your ancestors’ Cavaliers, and they don’t 
care about history or respect.
Virginia, historically, is a bad football team. But just 
like deep-frying that holiday bird, tradition has gone 
right out the damn window.
After losing 17 games the last two years, who could 
have predicted such a quick turnaround for the 8-3 Wa-hoos? Even Athletic Director Craig Littlepage admitted he couldn’t have envisioned Saturday’s matchup being a play-in game for the ACC Championship.
But it is. And the Cavaliers are going to carve up some 
Hokie and pile on the gravy. Wah-hoo-wah!
— MATT WATTS
Now, on to the picks!
In first, with a 56-38 record, is The Associated Press’ 
Mark “It’s funny because you’re fat” Long, who couldn’t 
resist reaching for the low-hanging fruit when Charlie Weis said Thanksgiving is his favorite holiday. Hey Mark, did you drive in the fast lane when you covered NASCAR last weekend … because it looks like your hair didn’t keep up! 
Holding strong in second with a 52-42 record is al-ligatorSports writer Greg “I got scooped on my own thoughts” Luca, who cemented his moniker of “worst re-porter in Alligator history” during the weekend when a colleague was able to disseminate Greg’s thoughts to the masses before Greg could even formulate them. 
Nipping at Greg’s heels with a 51-43 record is alliga-
torSports assistant editor Matt “Put me out of my misery already” Watts, who can’t handle watching the Jaguars anymore. Trying to make sense of Jack Del Rio’s coach-ing decisions this season, Matt has aged about three years, moving him right into middle age.
In fourth with a 48-46 record is alligatorSports writer 
Tyler “I made out with a girl, I think” Jett, whose esca-pades at a Neon Liger event in Gainesville ended with some ambiguous promiscuity. Jett says he came with, and left with, a person of the opposite sex, but when it comes to getting a heaping helping of dude tongue, he’s not so sure.  
Climbing to fifth at 47-47 is ESPN’s Mike “Need a 
hand?” DiRocco, who asked an athlete Tuesday if he ever needed assistance going to the bathroom while he was battling an injury earlier in his career. Always the Good Samaritan, Mike was willing to lend a helping hand if no one else did. 
Falling to sixth with a 46-48 record is FightinGators.
com’s Cody “I’m really happy for the rest of you, but Taylor Swift is the best female country singer with a face that looks like that of an anteater OF ALL TIME” Jones, who gave a standing ovation from his living room while watching Swift at the American Music Awards. She’s the cheer captain, Cody, and you’re on the bleachers. 
In seventh with a 44-50 record is InsideTheGators.
com’s Kyle “Mushrooms are out of this world” Maistri, who spent his Friday night trying to convince the rest of us that mushrooms are organisms brought to earth by aliens thousands of years ago. We think you may be watching too much “Ancient Aliens,” Kyle.
And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 40-54 record is 
alligatorSports editor Tom “Where’d you get your jokes, the joke store?” Green, whose side-splitting humor has had us all rolling lately. Sike. (See what we did there?) Tom, your references to Jay-Z’s rhymes and other rap lyr -
ics have got to stop, for everyone’s sake.

“Those are areas that we 
have to get better at, at least I do, of just illustrating those points, explaining those points and helping them get better,” Donovan said. “Be-cause I think there was times in the game when we’re up 15 or 16 points and we self-sabotage.”
Despite making just one 
three for the second game in a row, freshman Brad Beal exemplified Donovan’s wish for better decision-making by scoring a career-high 22 points mostly off the dribble. Beal had five strong drives to the basket, with three layups and two dunks.
“He told 
us to attack the basket more be-cause they were go-ing to start closing out because we 
were hitting shots,” Beal said. “So we had to start attacking the basket more to try to get to the free throw line.”

� UF HOSTS FSU ON SENIOR DAY.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
When John Brantley and Deonte Thomp-
son first met, the future seemed incredibly 
bright.  
Standing in The Swamp on a recruiting 
trip during Florida’s 2006 season, Brantley — a Texas commit with the long, flowing brown locks he has since trimmed — and Thompson discussed their eventual decision to go to UF. It was the beginning of an enduring friend-ship. 
But for as close as they have become off 
the field, the connection never materialized in games. 
The No. 3 pro-style quarterback and No. 8 
wide receiver recruit in the country , according to Rivals.com, were supposed to be college football’s next great pass-catching combination in the mold of Brady Quinn to Jeff Samardzija at Notre Dame or Troy Smith to Ted Ginn at Ohio State — duos that departed just before Brantley and Thompson’s freshman year. 
But, in the four years since, Brantley’s ca-
reer has been marred by time on the bench, initial struggles and injuries, while Thompson has become known more for his drops than his catches. 
“Sometimes it doesn’t pan out,” Brantley 
said. “There’s no real good answer for that. It’s hard to say.”
Said Thompson: “We made the best of 
what we can do and it was pretty good. It was fun.”
Saturday the senior duo will take the field 
at The Swamp for the last time as Florida (6-5, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) faces off against Florida State (7-4, 5-3 Atlantic Coast Confer -
ence) at 7 p.m. 
In 2010, Brantley’s first year as the starter, Thompson led UF with 570 yards on 38 catch-es, the lowest totals by Florida’s leading re-ceiver since 1989. What stood out more than his receptions were his drops, as Thompson seemed to continually struggle with wide-open passes in critical situations. 
This year he has taken a step backward, re-
cording just 19 catches for 237 yards and one 
touchdown. 
Brantley’s career has 
followed a similarly disap-pointing arc, as he struggled through 2010 and has been hampered by injuries for most of 2011. 
“Everything ain’t play 
out our way ,” Thompson said. “A couple different of-
fenses, different coaches and stuff. Happens that way sometimes.” 
Despite Thompson’s shortcomings, coach 
Will Muschamp sees reason to believe football might not be in his rearview mirror just yet.  
As his role in the offense has decreased, 
Thompson has become a bigger part of Flor -
ida’s special teams, contributing to the cover -
age and punt-block units. 
“I wasn’t a good special teams guy , but I 
took it upon myself to get on some and try to help the team win,” Thompson said. 
Coupled with his speed, physicality and 
athleticism, his experience on special teams could earn him consideration during April’s NFL Draft. 
“I think he’s really helped himself as far as 
those things are concerned,” Muschamp said. “He’s doing all the right things.”
Regardless of where their football paths 
finally end, neither Brantley nor Thompson expressed second thoughts over deciding to come to Florida. 
“No regrets at all,” Thompson said. “I 
wouldn’t change it for the world.”

Brantley, Thompson have ‘no regrets’ as final home game looms
telling you watts up
There was no chain slung around his neck. There was no ferocious glare on his face. There was no energy, no passion. 
Dominique Easley was the last player to emerge from 
Florida’s locker room Saturday against Furman. He didn’t run to the sideline. He hardly jogged. 
After the game, after the Gators pulled out just their 
sixth win of the season, Easley looked lethargic. While his teammates rushed to the corner of the north end zone to celebrate the victory by singing the alma mater with the band, Easley slouched behind. 
Florida, our Alma Mater ... Thy glorious name we praise 
…
He hung back, behind reporters, behind team person-
nel, behind families. 
All thy loyal sons and daughters … A joyous song shall 
raise …
One of those families asked to take a picture with Eas-
ley. He took a break from pretending to care about the cel-ebration, draped his long, tired arms over the shoulders of two kids beaming at a chance to meet their hero. 
‘Neath the Orange and Blue victorious our love shall never 
fail…
Easley forced a smile. Click. Against Furman, Easley and the 
rest of the underachieving Gators played with the same apathetic at-titude. They walked onto the field with a sense of entitlement. They believed they were great, they be-lieved that their natural abilities and the cursive script on their hel-mets was all they needed. 
But they were flat-out wrong. And that’s why they are 
where they are: at 6-5 and the lowest point in Florida foot-ball in the last 25 years. 
There’s no other name so glorious…“We’ve got some young guys that think you’re going 
to roll your hat out there and win games and that’s not the way it works,” Will Muschamp said Monday. 
While part of the blame lies with Muschamp, he does 
not suit up on Saturdays — although I’m sure he wishes he could. At the end of the day, it’s players, not plays or coaching. And the players on this team don’t get it. 
They saw Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin light up the 
scoreboard, winning games and national championships like it was easy. They saw their own names on websites like Scout.com, touting their talents and anointing them as stars before they even played a down of real, big-time football.
But when they saw that they couldn’t stack up, that 
their mettle would be tested down after down, game after game, they backed into a corner. 
And they don’t have anywhere to turn. After a while, 
players start to tune out their coaches’ motivational speeches. They need leaders, and this team is experienc-ing  a shortage in that regard. 
With a miniscule, nine-member senior class, leadership 
this season has been inconsistent, and that’s unacceptable. Younger players like Easley, who are in the spotlight de-servedly or not, are not pulling their weight. 
“Leaders don’t have bad days,” Muschamp said. “One 
might be a little tougher than the other one, but leaders don’t have bad days. They step up every day and they bring it every day. In a younger guy, that’s harder to un-derstand.”
Against Furman, Easley and a vast majority of the team 
had a bad day. But if they want to live up to the reputa-tion of the name on their helmets, those days must come to an end.
