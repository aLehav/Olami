Former Florida Gators and 
Pittsburgh Steelers running back 
Chris Rainey was arrested Thurs-day morning for allegedly hit-ting his girlfriend in a southwest 
Gainesville apartment complex.
Gainesville Police charged 
Rainey, 24, of Lakeland, with sim-
ple domestic battery , a ﬁ  rst-degree misdemeanor, GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said.
The incident started at about 
8 a.m. Thursday when Rainey and his girlfriend were saying 
goodbye at the Hannah’s Condo-
minium complex, at the corner of Southwest 34th Street and South-west 42nd Place, according to a GPD arrest report.
When they hugged, the wom-
an felt what she thought was her cell phone in Rainey’s pocket. She asked Rainey about the phone, 
and the couple started to argue.
Rainey then ran around the 
residence, hid the phone and left 
the area, police said.
The woman found the phone and later climbed into a car be-longing to one of Rainey’s room-mates.
When Rainey returned a short 
time later to ﬁ  nd the phone, he confronted his girlfriend at the car.
The couple argued again, and 
Rainey started to pull the woman from the passenger’s side of the 
car by her arms, according to the 
report.
Neighbors 
said they saw 
Rainey slap the woman as he pulled her out of the car.
The couple 
fell to the ground, and the woman 
ran away . Rainey caught up with 
her and grabbed at a bag that con-
tained the phone. The couple fell 
down again.
At 8:26 a.m., GPD ofﬁ  cers 
received a call from a neighbor 
about the ﬁ  ght and responded to the scene.
Rainey told ofﬁ  cers he argued 
with the woman about the cell Chris Rainey arrested 
on battery charge

Burrito Brothers Taco Co. is temporarily 
closed due to construction.  
The restaurant, which has been serving 
burritos for about 35 years, moved to its 
location at 1402 W. University Ave. seven 
years ago.
Paul Marino, the morning manager, said 
the building is going to be sold, so it had an 
inspection Wednesday. While reviewing the building, inspectors discovered the ceiling was structurally collapsing.
“We have to close down to restructure 
our roof,” he said. “People are here looking at it to ﬁ  x it.”
Marino said he does not know when the 
restaurant will reopen, but he hopes to learn more in the week.
The company is in the process of cover-
ing the staff’s wages with insurance during the temporary closure, Marino said, and he hopes the staff doesn’t quit to ﬁ  nd other work.
Ciara Lepanto, an English sophomore, 
said she was disappointed Burrito Bros. 
closed.
“That’s crazy ,” she said about the news. 
“It kind of sucks.”
The 19-year-old said she loves the restau-
rant’s atmosphere and location.
“It’s super local, good, cheap and quick,” 
she said. “I love that not many students 
know about it.”
Aerospace engineering sophomore Sam 
Sheets said he visits Burrito Bros. about once a month.
“I just love Burrito Brothers,” the 20-year-
old said. “I would probably cry if it was shut down the whole semester.”Burrito Bros. closes temporarily
� STUDENTS CAN PAY TUITION AND 
FEES.

Paying tuition is now easier.
Make a Payment is a new addition to the 
UF mobile website that lets students pay tuition and fees from their wireless device.
UF Information Technology , under the 
guidance of the University Bursar’s Ofﬁ  ce, began efforts to mobilize the myUFL fea-ture, which went live in December.
“Students can feel completely safe when 
making payments using the myUFL mobile ‘Make a Payment’ app,” UF’s Information Technology Communications Manager Tracy Gale wrote in an email. “The series of security checks and encryption is extremely secure.”
 Gale said the Bursar’s ofﬁ  ce oversaw 
the project on behalf of UF students and be-gan working on the addition in mid-2012.
Payment options for the 500 payments 
made on myUFL each day are important, she said, because students live in an in-creasingly mobile world.
“We want to make the UF academic and 
administrative environment as student-friendly as we possibly can,” she said.
Gale said she didn’t know how many 
students would use the mobile version in-stead of the Web version.
Brooke Meislik, a 20-year-old chemistry 
junior, will stick to paying her fees online.
“I use the Web more for making pur-
chases,” she said. “It’s very time-consuming 
to type in that information on the phone.”

Elizabeth J. Braun’s promotion to a 
Gainesville Fire Rescue lieutenant was not 
only an honor but also an inspiration from the legacy of her family.
Braun stood in front of friends, coworkers 
and family members, while her husband and sister presented her with a badge — the same one that belonged to her father, William A. Diven, a New Jersey volunteer firefighter who died Saturday.
For Braun, the promotion was a 10-year 
work in progress.
“It’s been something I’ve been work-
ing very hard for, for a very long time,” she 
said.
Braun was one of three officials honored 
during a promotional ceremony Thursday 
at the Service Support Bureau, 1026 NE 14th St.
Allen W. Siorek and Jeffrey J. Lane were 
also honored at the ceremony. Siorek was promoted to district chief, while Lane be-came an assistant chief of the department.
Fire Chief Gene Prince, who has worked 
with the department for 28 years, said pro-motional ceremonies are fire services’ tradi-tion to recognize milestones, and it takes a number of years for members to move to a new position.
Prince conducted the majority of the cere-
mony, while Paul Folkers, assistant city man-ager for the city, later swore in the officials.
Before his promotion, Siorek served as a 
lieutenant for five years, Prince said. 
“He’s positioned himself well,” he said. “He’s always one of those to be involved and wanting to learn, not just about what’s going 
on in his crew, but also what’s going on in the 
department.”Lane, who has worked for the department 
for 22 years, spent the last six years as a dis-
trict chief and was a lieutenant prior to that.
As assistant chief, Lane will now lead the 
department’s training bureau. He said there 
are a lot of role models in the department.
“It’s been a journey as the opportunities 
became available,” Lane said. “During that time, I’ve learned from the people who went before me.”
When Lane first became a firefighter, he 
worked with Prince as a new lieutenant.
“I was there on Jeff’s first day,” Prince re-
called during the ceremony. “Jeff showed up as a rookie, and a guy introduced him to his rookie lieutenant, which was me.”
Lane said he and Prince took different 
paths within the department but eventually found themselves working together once again.
“I could have never imagined in a mil-
lion years that today I’d be working for him again,” Lane said. “The opportunities and the journey led me here, and ironically, it’s with the first lieutenant I ever had.”
Prince said this is the only promotional 
ceremony from GFR expected for this year, but it was an event that focused on Braun, Lane and Siorek’s dedication to the depart-
ment.
“The milestones that they’re each reach-
ing to today is something they chose in their 
careers to move up to,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2013

A  UF scientist is one step closer 
to inventing an anti-obesity drug 
after his studies were published Sunday in the science journal Nature Medicine.
Stephen Hsu collaborated 
with scientists from Harvard University and Boston University to target a protein, TRIP-Br2, and mimic its absence, which helps the body burn fat and prevents insulin resistance and obesity.
Beginning in 2007 at UF’s 
Sid Martin Biotechnology 
Development Institute, Hsu put 
a sample of mice on a high-fat diet. 
Mice with two copies of the 
gene became insulin resistant, developed Type 2 diabetes and had high cholesterol. Mice with one copy of the 
gene had normal effects, and mice with no gene remained lean and burned fat.
Hsu first identified the protein 
in 1996 during 
his residency in internal m e d i c i n e at Harvard 
Medical School.
He said 
turning his 
findings from mice into an 
approved drug for humans could take seven to 10 years and cost millions of dollars.
“It’s the difference between 
mice and men,” Hsu said.
He said he is very optimistic 
that the drug will be available for humans to use.
“I want to know that I developed something that would have a large impact on a large population,” Hsu said.
In 2008, he collaborated with 
UF’s Clinical and Translational 
Science Institute to work on the 
research.
“We’re very interested in 
supporting this concept and its application on humans,” said David Nelson, director of UF’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute.
He said the center helped 
to fund Hsu’s salary and his research through a grant from the National Institutes of Health.
Hsu described the feeling of 
having his findings published as satisfying.
“Nobody believes you until you 
publish it,” he said. “We brought very important large work of five 
years to tell a complete story, so 
people can move forward with this discovery.”

Potato mashers, Pre-World War II ice cream cartons and swizzle 
sticks.
These are some of the personal collections that will be on dis-
play during the 34th Annual Collectors Day at the Florida Museum 
of Natural History Saturday.
The free event, which will be from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., will feature 
about 65 hobbyists and their collections at the museum, 3215 Hull Road.
Display items will range from miniature shoes to turkey calls 
to a collection of classic cars parked in front of the building, said Paul Ramey, assistant director of marketing and public relations for the museum.
He said he has seen his share of unusual items during the 
years.
One time, he said, a collector brought about 20 heavy antique 
boat motors to the event.
“It definitely was not an easy thing to transfer,” he said.The event attracts collecting enthusiasts and history buffs from 
across the southeast U.S.
Some collectors have attended the event for about 20 years, and 
their interaction is what keeps the event thriving, Ramey said.
“They enjoy talking to other people interested in the same 
things and answering questions,” he said.Personal collections, 
eclectic treasures to be displayed at annual event
Several neighbors witnessed Rainey’s slap
phone but denied hitting her, according to the report.  
He added that when he confronted his girlfriend, he 
grabbed the bag, and the two started tugging it. He also 
said the woman got out of the car voluntarily.
Officers then arrested Rainey and transported him 
to the Alachua County Jail. At 10:57 a.m., police booked him into the jail, where he remained later that night without bond.
While at UF in 2010, Rainey was arrested on a felony 
aggravated stalking charge after he sent a text message saying, “Time to die b****” to a girl he dated, according to Alligator archives. The State Attorney’s Office later reduced the charge to a misdemeanor.  
Rainey, a member of the Gators’ 2008 national cham-pionship team, played four seasons at Florida as a run-ning back, a wide receiver and on special teams.
Pittsburgh selected Rainey during the fifth round 
with the 159th overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft. He 
served primarily as a kick returner for the Steelers this 
season.
At about 3 p.m. Thursday , the Steelers announced 
that they would remove Rainey from the team roster.
“Chris Rainey’s actions this morning were extremely 
disappointing, said Kevin Colbert, general manager for the Steelers, in a statement. “Under the circumstances and due to this conduct, Chris will no longer be a mem-ber of the Pittsburgh Steelers.”

Break out the board games, costumes and 
comic books — SwampCon is back in the Reitz 
Union this weekend.
The second annual multigenre convention 
will be from 11 a.m. to midnight Saturday and 
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. The event is 
free and open to the public.
SwampCon Sustainability and Tabletop Coordinator David Wasserman sought to make the convention carbon-neutral this year.
The 22-year-old sustainability studies se-
nior partnered with Sustainable UF to offset 19.5 tonnes of carbon from the two days in the Reitz Union as well as carbon emissions from the flights of three guests for less than $250.
Becoming carbon-neutral required a tran-
sit-oriented website, shuttles to and from the hotels and a central location like the Reitz Union.“We are the first multigenre convention to 
be carbon-neutral in Florida,” he said.
Last year, about 1,600 people attended 
SwampCon. This year 1,600 have registered so far. SwampCon Event Coordinator Ciara Powell said she expects 4,000 to 5,000 people to attend. The 21-year-old electrical engineer -
ing senior said people can expect a lot more science fiction, video game, anime and Star Wars panels.
Through one of its sponsors, Sequential Art-ists Workshop, SwampCon received a $4,000 tourism grant from the City of Gainesville. 
The event, which cost about $8,000, was also 
supplemented with funds from Student Gov-ernment.
SwampCon is also hosting a charity auc-
tion. A wooden chest at the sign-in table will raise funds for Doctors Without Borders, Ala-chua County Forever and Alachua Habitat for Humanity.
“It’s definitely scaled up this year,” Was-
serman said.

UF Web services may have

ISIS, e-Learning in Sakai, 
Gatorlink Webmail, Outlook Web Access for UF Exchange and Campus SMTP services experienced an outage at about noon Wednesday.
The equipment and sys-

experienced broader system issues this morning,” Gale said.
CNS resolved the service 
outages by 1:37 p.m. Thurs-day.
Gale could not comment 
on how the outage would 
impact drop/add week for

� LULU EXCLUSIVELY LAUNCHED AT UF LAST FALL.
KATIE BURNS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Lulu smartphone application opened the conversation 
for guys to have their say.
Lulu, which exclusively launched at UF last semester, uses 
Facebook to provide a catalog of their male friends, allowing 
girls to review them. On Thursday, the app released an addi-tional component that will open the platform to guys.
With LuluDude, guys will be able to claim their profiles and 
distinguish themselves. The more he does so, the more visible he’ll be to users. A couple hundred guys have downloaded LuluDude since its launch Thursday afternoon, and that num-ber is “changing by the minute,” said Lulu CEO Alexandra Chong.
“We hope that guys start to engage and put their best foot 
forward to girls,” she said.
Ryan Weiss thinks the app will only cause trouble.“I think that it will make it so guys can preserve their repu-tation somewhat, but I think that the premise itself is promot-ing drama and gossip among the university community,” said 
the 21-year-old criminology senior.
With Lulu, girls review guys in appearance, humor, man-
ners, ambition, first kiss, sex and commitment. Chong said 
about 3,000 female UF students have Lulu on their phones. About 4 million guys have been checked out, and at least 60 percent of girls who have logged on come back every day.
“The comments and hashtags given are so sassy that you 
can’t help but laugh,” said 20-year-old early education sopho-more Kasey Greene.Popular dating mobile app expands to include both gendersAbout 1,600 people have registered for the eventReader response

It feels like we’ve been back to school for a whole month, not just 
one week. 
Not to mention, the weather has confused us into believing that 
this is just more of Fall semester. Don’t be fooled by the balmy-ness 
of things; it’s very much another grueling Spring.

How do you think it feels to be Leonardo DiCaprio? 
Always a bridesmaid, never an Oscar winner. Poor guy 
wasn’t nominated for his role in “Django Unchained,” so that’s gotta hurt a little. Plus, he walked his sweetheart, Kate Winslet, down the aisle of her wedding to some other dude. The other dude’s name? Ned Rocknroll. No, we’re not kidding. We give a maybe-you-will-have-better-luck-next-year-or-never LAUREL to Leo.
Our country’s been hit with so many school shootings 
lately (one in Newtown, Conn. last month, one in Cali-fornia on Thursday) that we almost don’t know what to do with ourselves. Should we be angry? Should we be in mourning? We should take up our pens and begin some civil action. We should write emails and make phone calls to lawmakers. If you’re wondering how to stop this from happening again, now’s the time to actually try. We give a we’re-sick-of-allowing-this-to-keep-happening DART to 
American gun culture. 
In case you forgot, Britney Spears is still awesome. We 
didn’t personally watch this season of “The X Factor,” but we really enjoyed seeing clips and watching GIFs on loop of Britney’s awesome faces. Sadly, her $15 million fee didn’t really do anything for the show’s ratings, and the show was rumored to be letting her go. Only, because she’s basically our Honey Boo Boo before there was Honey Boo Boo, she chose to quit before they had the chance to ﬁ  re her. We give a what-an-incredibly-ballsy-move LAUREL  
to BritBrit. 
There’s only so much we can take from you, Justin Tim-
berlake. News broke Thursday that he may release a new album in the near-ish future. “I don’t want to put anything out that I think is something I don’t love. You just don’t get that every day. You have to wait for it ... I’m ready,” he said in a weird video he released. Either give us the music or get out, JTimbz! We give a hey-that’s-funny-we-talked-about-Britney-and-Justin-on-the-same-page-but-it-wasn’t-about-their-relationship FLART to Justin Timberlake. We 
love you, but we hate the way you tease us. 
A new survey from the U.S. Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention states that more and more women choose to binge drink: “Nearly 14 million U.S. women binge drink about three times a month, downing about six beverages per binge.” Sounds totally cool, right? Wrong. Binge drink-ing, according to the survey, kills more than 20,000 women and girls each year. We give a how-hard-is-it-to-not-be-stupid DART to American alcohol culture.
That’s all for this week, folks. Stay warm and go

I’m tired of people telling me Obama is a good guy.
“Brandon, he’s one of us. He was raised by a single 
mother. He inhaled!” 
Obama is not a good guy , and having inhaled doesn’t 
change it.
Last week, the president signed the renewed National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the notorious legisla-
tion that allows for the indeﬁ  nite detainment of American citizens without trial, making it legal for 2013. 
Think about that for a moment. Think about the implica-
tions of such powers.
If the president wanted to take you in, he could do it, and 
you might never have a day in court. You would be in con-ﬁ  nement until he decided to let you go.
This is an egregious breach of fundamental liberty . This is 
the box of matches that can torch any rights we thought we had. It sounds like a scene in some dystopian novel, but it’s not ﬁ  ction. It’s real, and it’s scary.
“But Brandon, he’s only using it against the guys who are 
trying to kill us.”
That doesn’t much matter. Nobody should have such 
power for any reason. I am a natural-born citizen of this country . I have a right to a trial, and the same goes for every citizen.
Every citizen is due a day in court — even those who are 
trying to kill us. There is no great impediment to the control and stopping of terrorism caused by courtrooms. The alter-native, however, is just as potentially destructive and menac-ing as any terrorism.
In any case, we would never know whether the power 
was being used with discretion if there were no trial to speak of. Even if the president were using the power wisely, there 
is no guarantee that this power wouldn’t be misused some-
day in the future by other leaders.
The president isn’t the only reprobate in this story. We 
also have our congressmen and congresswomen to hold ac-countable.
UF graduate Corrine Brown of “go gata” fame voted to have this legislation renewed, along with several other members of Florida congress.
Our congressman, Cliff Stearns, 
abstained from voting on the 2013 NDAA. Senator Bill Nelson voted against the legislation, but Senator Marco Rubio voted to pass it. 
I urge you to call your congress-
men and senators if they voted in favor of the NDAA. Call their of-
ﬁ  ces, and tell them you don’t like what they did.
Then, when elections come up again, vote them out of of-
ﬁ  ce. We need to get rid of them. We can’t have people with such dangerous ideas running the country.
One of the saddest parts about all of this is that too many 
of us have no idea any of this happened. The NDAA passed 
with little fanfare from the news outlets.
It seems like a deception took place to renew NDAA amid 
all of the “ﬁ  scal cliff” circus that played out on the news. Like 
a magician performing a slight-of-hand trick, the big wigs di-rected our attention at one thing and quietly did something else while we were distracted.
I don’t understand how any sane person who is at all con-
cerned with his or her own safety, or the safety of the public at large, could convince themselves that it’s OK that many 
of the most powerful people in the country think destroying 
habeas corpus is good for us.
If we don’t stop them in their tracks now, the next bill of 
this kind to be proposed will be a little worse, and the one after that worse still. 
Obama has already assassinated an American citizen 
once before. Will the next step be to make such assassina-tions legal?
We can’t just sit back on this one. This one is bad. This one 
is where we have to draw the line.

opinions@alligator.org FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
It’s a new year, a new semester, a new beginning and a clean 
slate. It’s another chance to create new goals and to accom-plish old ones. 
At the start of each of my past ﬁ  ve semesters at UF, I told 
myself to raise my GPA.
Well, that never happened.Actually, my GPA steadily decreased every semester.However, as a habit, every January and August, I make plans 
to attend class more often, review notes, socialize less and begin preparing for exams days in advance.
Don’t get me wrong. I am not anti-education. But repeated 
long nights at Library West with two cans of caffeine and heavy bags under my eyes are not my scene.
Perhaps I lack self-discipline, or maybe this lifestyle doesn’t 
suit me.  
It’s also a bit impractical to hold myself to such expectations 
now.
As a junior with two majors and time-consuming upper-level 
classes, I no longer have room in my schedule to choose from a wide variety of general education courses, carefully picked with afternoon class times and high RateMyProfessors.com ratings. Or for feel-good ﬂ  uff classes designed for non-majors, such as Man’s Food or Fruits for Fun and Proﬁ  t. 
But why am I stressing out about 
my GPA? How important is a college GPA to our success in life? 
In fact, what is the purpose of col-
lege?
For those interested in pursuing 
professional ﬁ  elds such as law or med-icine, GPA is a large factor for admis-sion into graduate programs. The pur-pose of their undergrad time is to get into graduate school.
The rest of us have to be ready to succeed in the “real world” 
postgraduation. We need to tackle problems and handle situa-tions like mature adults.
Sure, I work with a team better than I used to, write persuasive 
speeches on the health care reform and speak intelligently about how supply and demand affect price, but it’s rather unlikely that most of what I’ve learned in class will apply to real life.
We’ve been taught since elementary school that grades are 
the determining factor in performance. We still have the mindset that smart students get As, average ones get Cs and failures get 
Fs.
I’ve seen so many of my peers stressing about grades thinking 
that if they don’t have high grades, they will not be successful. 
GPA is not correlated to professional success.
A high GPA does not necessarily give you a higher chance of 
securing a full-time job after college. Employers may look for a satisfactory GPA for your ﬁ  rst few internships or jobs as one of the many factors they consider, but after that, your work experi-ence, ability to work with others and network are more impor-
tant.
In the 2005 National Association of Colleges and Employers 
Research, managers ranked GPA as less important on the list of 
considerations than communication skills, work ethic, teamwork skills, leadership skills, self-conﬁ  dence, friendliness and tactful-ness. 
It’s a new semester, so we have a fresh start. There should be 
no regrets about how we spend our college years. Raising your 
GPA is, of course, a good goal to have, and there are no down-
sides to it. But if you’re struggling and stressing because of it, leave the perfectionist in you behind. Your desire for a higher GPA should not be so important that your overall college experi-ence suffers and you don’t have time to explore other opportuni-ties.
The college experience is about gaining independence and ex-
periencing new things. It’s about joining groups, meeting differ-ent people, trying new things, making mistakes, learning about yourself and making memories. It’s supposedly the best time of our lives — don’t ruin it.
And remember what President George W. Bush told a group 
of Yale University graduates in 2001: “To all the C-students, I say you, too, can be president of the United States.”
Or better said, “Cs get degrees.”Raksheen Ayaz is an advertising and journalism junior at UF. Her 
column runs on Thursdays.Here’s why your GPA 
should not be your New Year’s goalColumn
On Dec. 14, a gunman killed his mom and 26 
people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. 
Twenty of those victims were children. The media’s response was swift, as facts were 
made known as soon as they were found out via outlets such as Facebook and Twitter. 
Response from the general public was just as 
quick, if not quicker, with “#PrayForNewtown” be-coming the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter and gun control debates springing up between keyboard warriors. 
Then, nothing but silence. Interest waned as the 
next big story came along. 
Debates ﬁ  zzled as all but the most ardent of sup-
porters on either side moved on with their lives as if 
everything was the same as it was a week ago.
What happened? 
We were so quick to stand strong, so quick to po-
liticize the tragedy, so quick to interject ourselves into the cacophony. 
We retweeted hashtags and shared statuses.There were two simultaneous national move-
ments both for and against increased gun control that rose from the doldrums in six hours.
That’s the problem, though: We’ve grown accustomed to spending a short 
amount of time on human issues, then moving on because we’re not directly involved.
It was done and over, wrapped up and compart-
mentalized within our minds before even a week passed.
The trending topic didn’t even make the top 10 
of trending topics for December. 
We said our bit, or even our refusal to say our bit, 
then moved on.
Twenty-six people died. Their futures were erased. The only impact they would ever have on the 
world now will be in the political realm as a catalyst for gun control legislation.
Who among us stopped to take the time to reﬂ  ect 
on the loss of those lives? 
I know I didn’t.Who among us reﬂ  ected adequately not just on 
the children, but on the adults who died trying to protect them? 
Again, not me.
Somewhere along the 
line, we became a society 
that believes in the power of the “Like” button more 
than the power of caring. 
The public display that 
we care means more than 
whether or not we actually care. 
Appearance means more than substance.We’ve become social media politicians, trying to 
keep our true opinions under wraps while seeking 
acceptance by the general population.
Instead of votes, we measure our worth by 
retweets and likes. 
Cookie-cutter empathy is the new black — it goes 
with anything. People use it to encourage debate, and people use it to stiﬂ  e those same debates.
We even minimize events like these in the words 
we use. 
UF getting shellacked in the Sugar Bowl was a 
“tragedy.”
How does a football game’s result even come 
close to the same level as Sandy Hook?
For us, every story like this ends with the ap-
prehension or suicide of those who caused the trag-edy. 
Few words are said for those who have to move 
on, whose lives were personally altered in drastic ways over the course of the event.
On the rare occasion that a news entity does a 
follow-up, it’s certainly not front-page news. 
There is no action in soldiering on — no pulse-
pounding, heart-gripping response to the tale of a parent making a survivor’s favorite breakfast on his ﬁ  rst day back to school. 
We make one or two statuses, maybe tweet for a 
day or two, and then it’s back to posting our dinners on Instagram and watering our crops on FarmVille.
For us, it’s a new semester. For those who survived, it’s a new life. 
We need to remember that.

Six local artists will bring a northeast 
Gainesville cemetery to life today with their vi-
sual interpretations of the historic site.
The free exhibit will feature a multimedia 
display of the Historic Evergreen Cemetery as part of the “This Wondrous Place” history and art exhibit.
Paintings and photographs of the site, as 
well as stories of the buried, will be displayed at the Thomas Center Galleries, 302 NE Sixth Ave., starting today through March 23.
The exhibit will celebrate the beauty and 
history of the 53-acre cemetery. The site is home to some of Florida’s notable 
individuals, including Dr. James Robert Cade, who led the team of scientists that invented Ga-torade in 1965.
“Evergreen is the oldest cemetery in 
Gainesville,” said Cemetery Coordinator Gary Smith. “We call our oldest section the Old Yard [because it] holds many of the founding fathers of the city.”
Gainesville Cultural Affairs Programs Co-
ordinator Russell Etling said the artists found more inspiration than he expected when they prepared the exhibit. 
“I originally expected to only have six pieces 
of art and ended up with 21,” he said. “We all rediscovered what the cemetery truly means to the city.”
Smith said the exhibit will help residents 
better appreciate the historic site.
“The cemetery is still active, so it is a kind of 
living museum, allowing us to remember our past, but also recognize the present,” he said.Local artists use multimedia

Gainesville Police formed a task force Monday dedicated to 
reducing property theft throughout the city.
The Special Operations Unit consists of 13 ofﬁ  cers and two 
sergeants, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
The unit absorbed the duties of the department’s Gang 
Intervention Unit, Neighborhood Street Crimes Unit and the 
Property Detectives, he said.
The group will also handle street-level drug problems and respond to emergency calls if they are needed, he said.
Ofﬁ  cers will work in uniform, as well as undercover, as they 
investigate property theft cases.
During the Christian Aguilar investigation in the Fall, the 
city experienced a slight increase in burglaries, Tobias said.
“GPD had so many resources, including property detec-tives, tied into the investigation that the caseload for the prop-erty detectives was getting huge,” he said.
The department formed a temporary task force to investi-
gate the burglaries during the Aguilar investigation.
The unit later became a permanent ﬁ  xture in the depart-
ment after GPD ofﬁ  cials saw its potential to reduce crime, To-bias said.
“They’re going to immerse themselves in the world of bur-
glaries to ﬁ  gure out who the major players are and ﬁ  gure out if there are any patterns to anything,” he said.

With Erik Murphy suffering 
from a broken rib and Will Yeg-
uete nursing tendinitis in his right 
knee, Florida needed a frontcourt 
player to step up against Georgia.
Casey Prather answered the 
call.
Prather started with a one-
armed offensive rebound that led to a layup.
2-0, Gators.Then, Prather made a jumper 
from the wing.
4-0.Shortly after, he stole the ball 
from Bulldogs guard Vincent Wil-
liams and finished with a break-away dunk.
The two-handed slam gave UF 
an early 6-0 lead.
“I just wanted to be aggres-
sive,” Prather said.
“I know this is a big game for 
us getting started with [Southeast-
ern Conference] play, so I was just trying to figure out what I could 
do to win.”
In his first start since Feb. 24, 
2011, Prather led the charge as 
the No. 11 Gators opened with an 
11-0 run.
The strong start put Georgia 
away early in No. 11 Florida’s 77-
44 win. 
While his early scoring caught 
the most attention, Prather’s per -formance was well-rounded.
For the first time in his Florida 
career, the junior led the Gators in rebounds, grabbing seven against 
the Bulldogs.
Prather hauled in possibly his 
biggest rebound with 5:21 left in 
the first half.
After Brandon Morris missed 
a jumper, Prather grabbed the rebound over Patric Young and Georgia’s 6-foot-11 center, John Florveus.
Prather also led the Gators 
with three steals, which tied a ca-reer high. 
“He’s given us a different di-
mension and a different kind of 
guy, because when we play him 
at the power forward spot, he’s an undersized forward, but he’s

Rebounding has been an issue for center Patric Young and for -
ward Erik Murphy this season. Both players’ production on the 
glass has dropped from last season.
The 6-foot-9, 249-pound Young has averaged only five rebounds 
per game in the past six games. In Murphy’s past four contests, he has pulled down only 3.3 rebounds per game.
Young and Murphy struggled to rebound in No. 11 Florida’s 
77-44 win against Georgia on Wednesday night. 
Young grabbed his first rebound with 9:29 left in the contest. He 
finished with three boards. 
Murphy, who played with a broken rib, did not record a re-
bound.
Donovan was critical of 
his two starting big men. 
“Patric, because of his size, 
people are always going to keep a body on him,” coach Billy Dono-
van said. “He’s got to be able to make that effort spinning off a 
guy and trying to get at least to the same level as the guy who’s 
blocking him out.
“The same thing for Murphy. It’s a lot more difficult for Erik to 
offensive rebound, because he’s on the perimeter.”
Consistently rebounding has been a problem for Young 
throughout his college career. Young has had back-to-back games with double-digit rebounds twice in his career, neither of which came this season. He has recorded double-digit rebounds in only 
10 of his 87 games with the Gators. 
According to KenPom.com, Young tallies a defensive rebound 
on 16.3 percent of his defensive possessions, while Murphy does 
so only 12.2 percent of the time. Both rank outside of the top 500 UF struggling on glass

After a slow start to begin the 
season, junior Jaterra Bonds rose 
to the occasion in the Gators’ first 
two games to open Southeastern 
Conference play.
Bonds made it three straight 
productive conference games on 
Thursday night.
She scored a team-best 17 
points and added six rebounds 
to help Florida beat Missis-sippi State (8-8, 0-3 SEC) 61-55 
in the Humphrey Coliseum in 
Starkville, Miss. 
“Each team is aggressive in 
our league, so you can’t sleep on 
any of them,” Bonds said. “Every 
night, I just try to bring it and be confident in my play.”
Only injury slowed Bonds 
on Thursday. With 51 seconds 
remaining in the second half, 
Bonds was cut on her left elbow, forcing freshman January Miller to step to the free throw line in her place. 
Miller made 1 of 2 attempts, 
increasing Florida’s lead to 59-55. 
Bonds received stitches after 
the game. 
“Jaterra showed great leader -
ship down the stretch,” coach 
Amanda Butler 
said. 
Unlike a year 
ago, when the Gators failed to hold leads late in games — par -
ticularly in con-
ference match-
ups — Florida notched its second 
consecutive victory after trailing late in the game.
The Gators defeated LSU 77-72 
on Sunday using a late 11-2 run, an effort that they nearly dupli-cated against Mississippi State. Gators prevail on roadRecorded seven rebounds

Ashanee Dickerson took to the 
corner of the mat at the start of her 
floor exercise. “Hottest in the Hood” by Red Cafe was blaring through the speakers. But more than the mu-
sic accompanied her.
The bass dropped, and Bridget 
Sloan could be seen performing ev-
ery move of Dickerson’s exercise. 
“Bridget likes to do everyone’s 
floor routine,” Dickerson said. “She told [coach Rhonda Faehn] that if I wasn’t competing one weekend and she was that she wanted my exer -
cise.”
Bridget Sloan, a former Olympic 
champion, has the potential to earn plenty of NCAA hardware not just because of her talent  — but because of her lively spirit.
“In every practice, she’s very 
disciplined and very hardworking, but at the same time, she really just 
lights it up, and everyone feeds off 
of that energy and her enthusiasm,” Faehn said of Sloan.
“[Her personality] really showed 
in the competition on Friday night. Obviously she started out with a near-perfect vault for her first per -
formance in college.”
Her 9.925 vault stick during her 
collegiate debut earned her a share of the vault title. Sloan was named 
the first Southeastern Conference 
Freshman Gymnast of the Week. 
“I was actually on Twitter, and 
people shouted at me ‘Congratula-
tions, SEC Freshman of the Week’ and I was like ‘Oh, all right. I’ll take it,’” Sloan said. 
“Obviously the SEC is a very 
prestigious conference and being named SEC Freshman of the Week 
is quite an accomplishment.”Sloan’s routine relies on a sense 
of rhythm. Alicia Sacramone, Sloan’s 
former 2008 Olympic teammate, de-cided to help.
Sacramone sent Sloan a text mes-
sage suggesting floor music for her routine. Eminem’s “Till I Collapse” highlighted the list of songs.
Sloan found the instrumental ver -sion to the track, and Faehn agreed to let the freshman incorporate the music into her routine.
“I’m actually glad I listened to 
[Sacramone] this time,” Sloan said. “I didn’t want a floor routine that people would just watch. I want them to be aware that I’m on the 
floor and not just any other athlete.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2013

Omar Craddock had a near 
perfect season last year. 
In addition to being part of 
Florida’s NCAA Indoor and 
Outdoor Championship teams 
in 2012, Craddock swept both 
the Southeastern Conference and NCAA individual titles in triple jump for the indoor and outdoor seasons. 
Craddock then finished 
fourth at the 2012 Olympic tri-
als for triple 
jump with 
a mark of 
16.55 meters, missing out on a trip to London by 1 meter.
A f t e r 
Craddock  
made a name for himself dur -
ing his junior campaign, he will start the 2013 season the on The Bowerman Watch List and at the top of competitors’ target list.
“A lot of people have been 
training to come get me, and they’re coming to get this team because we won three [na-
tional titles] in a row indoors 
and finally won one outdoors,” Craddock said. “It’s a lot of pressure, but you just have to be able to humble yourself and be ready to go and compete.”
While Craddock dominated 
in triple jump, he came up short in the long jump. The senior 
used the offseason to try to im-prove his marks in the event. 
Craddock said he’s gotten 
faster and reaches less because 
of his improved technique.
“Now that I’m on the watch 
list for The Bowerman, I know I really have to do something 
with this long jump if I want to 
really contend and try to win this award,” Craddock said.
As the No. 2 men’s and No. 
5 women’s teams head to the Crimson Tide Indoor Opener on Saturday in Birmingham, Ala., Craddock is hoping to set a new indoor personal re-
cord in long jump. His current 
personal best is 7.49m, which he set at the Texas A&M Chal-lenge in 2012. 
Still, Craddock is more fo-
cused on how the team per -
forms, especially the freshmen.
“The first meet is just for 
the team,” Craddock said. “I 
just want to see how the young 
guys and young women do. I’m excited to see what hap-pens.”
While the men won both 
NCAA titles, the women notched only the SEC indoor title in 2012. Florida returns 37 athletes on the women’s side. 
The women also boast the na-
tion’s No. 3 freshman class. 
“Our team is very talented 
all around,” Lanie Whittaker said. “We can possibly win it — SECs and Nationals. It’s finally our turn. We were bat-tling injuries last year, but this year is the girls’ time to shine.”

“It’s pretty tough to be a team 
that rebounds high up in the air 
above the rim when you’re so fo-
cused on blocking your guy out,” 
Young said on Nov . 6. “When you’re engaging someone, it’s 
hard to get off the ground. If we’re all doing our job making sure our individual guy doesn’t get the ball, we should be fine.”
Florida’s rebounding will 
be tested against one of the best frontcourts in the Southeastern Conference when UF travels to Baton Rouge, La., to face LSU on Saturday afternoon. 
Tigers forward and JUCO 
transfer Shavon Coleman aver -
ages a team-high 8.7 rebounds 
per contest, and sophomore big 
man Johnny O’Bryant III aver -
ages 7.5. 
LSU (9-3, 0-1 SEC) is tied for 
20th in the nation with 41.1 re-
bounds per game. UF (11-2, 1-0 
SEC) is No. 162 with 35.5. 
The Tigers are coming off a 
68-63 loss on the road against 
Auburn on Wednesday . LSU is 
8-1 this season when it wins the 
rebounding battle but 1-2 when outrebounded. 
“They’re going to have to 
keep those guys off the glass, and they’re going to have to chase balls off the backboard,” Dono-van said of his frontcourt. “[LSU 
is] obviously a big team up front. 
They rebound the ball very well. Johnny O’Bryant’s a high-energy guy .” 
With Murphy (fractured rib) 
and junior forward Will Yeguete (knee tendinitis) still ailing, the Gators will rely on Young and junior forward Casey Prather to 
crash the boards. 
“We definitely need Patric to 
try to chase some more balls on 
the glass,” Donovan said. “When 
he does do that, he’s a terrific 
rebounder, but it’s also hard for him to rebound a lot of times when he’s in the lane like he is, and so many people have got 
bodies on him.
“It’s a difficult and challeng-
ing proposition for him to go 
chase those kind of balls, but we need him to do that.” FRIDAY, JANUARY 11, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

UF ranks 162nd in boards per game
young , from page 13Bonds scores 5 points as part of 
10-3 Florida run to seal road victory  against SEC foe Mississippi State
Trailing 52-51 with 4:30 remaining in the second half, 
Florida (13-4, 2-1 SEC) finished the game on a 10-3 run. 
Bonds scored five points in the stretch before exiting the 
game to receive medical attention.
“We’re growing up and maturing,” Bonds said. “Last 
year, close leads, close games, we lost those games. I think 
that says a lot about our maturity and toughness, being able 
to hold off opponents.”
Butler said her team came in expecting a battle. Win-
ning on the road can be challenging no matter the oppo-
nent’s record, especially with unforced errors. 
The Gators shot 32 more free throws than the Bulldogs 
in the game but made only 64.1 percent of its tries. Florida also turned the ball over 19 times, . 
“This is a really, really good ugly win for us,” Butler 
said.“We didn’t expect anything other than that.” Bonds’ offensive production helped offset the lack of 
scoring from an injured Jennifer George. 
George was day-to-day coming into the game after suf-
fering a dislocated shoulder in a victory against LSU on Sunday. 
She came off the bench and struggled with a brace 
hampering her right arm.
George contested shots defensively but was tentative 
on offense, finishing 0 of 4 from the field with two missed free throws. 
“Jennifer came in and gave us the minutes she could,” 
Butler said. 
Vicky McIntyre filled in for George inside. McIntyre 
finished with 10 points on 4-of-7 shooting.
The Oklahoma State transfer added eight rebounds 
and four blocks.
McIntyre’s performance was the type of effort Butler 
and her coaching staff hope to see more consistently from the 6-foot-7 junior as the team looks to build on its strong start in conference play. 
“She was a difference maker for us tonight,” Butler 
said.
“She knew she had to be. She really stepped up and 
made the plays we expected her to make.”

Donovan says athleticism, 
quickness help undersized Prather in rebounding
quick (and) he’s athletic,” coach Billy Donovan said.
“He grabbed some incredible rebounds [Wednesday] in traffic. … 
It’s been two games now where he’s gotten back into the way he was at 
the end of last year.”
Guard Mike Rosario added: “I thought he did a great job at re-
bounding, being in the right spot (and) making smart decisions with 
the play.”
While Prather anticipated that he would play against Georgia, he 
didn’t learn he was starting until Wednesday morning.
His first career start was on Feb. 20, 2011 in a 68-61 win against 
LSU. 
Four days later Donovan gave him the starting nod again, this time 
for Florida’s 71-62 victory against Georgia. 
Prather didn’t have much success in his two previous starts. In both 
games combined, he was scoreless on 0-for-3 shooting while grabbing only three rebounds, an assist and one steal in 22 minutes.
On Wednesday night, Prather took advantage of his opportunity to 
start for the first time since his freshman year with his best performance of the season. 
Although Wednesday was Prather’s first start, the forward is still 
seeing a significant increase in playing time. He’s averaging 15.8 min-utes per game after averaging 9.5 minutes his sophomore year and 6.7 his freshman year.
“I felt that with his focus that he had in the last couple of practices 
that he deserved it,” Rosario said.
“One thing I can tell you about our ball team is that we have a lot 
of depth on our team. Any second, anyone is ready to come in and produce.”

Amanda Butler
UF coach  
  Josh: T  his year’s Florida lacrosse team has 
a chance to be dominant. The Gators lost 
just one player from last year’s squad, 
which made it to the national semiﬁ  nals. No Florida team that ﬁ  nished one game short of 
the ﬁ  nals the previous season has returned as 
high of a percentage of its lineup since the last 
men’s basketball championship run in 2006-07. If the Gators aren’t hoisting the champion-
ship trophy in Philadelphia on Memorial Day 
weekend, it will be legitimately shocking, and 
you can’t say that about any other team.
  
  Joe: Well, if the Gators’ lacrosse team gives half the effort you spend whining about work and your wrist injury every day, then 
my argument is dead in the water. Florida 
is undoubtedly one of the top national title 
contenders in NCAA lacrosse this season, but 
coach Amanda O’Leary’s club is not the sur-
est bet on campus. That distinction belongs to the UF men’s track and ﬁ  eld team. Statis-
tically speaking, no other squad on campus 
has a better chance to win it all in 2013 than 
the men’s and women’s track and ﬁ  eld teams. 
The NCAA crowns a national champion dur-ing both the indoor and outdoor seasons, and 
the Gators men clinched both titles last sea-son. Math. Boom. Now let your whiny rebut-
tal commence.
  
  Josh: Well, Joe, I wasn’t going to bring my in-
juries into this, but the fact that you decided 
to force your one writer who can only type with one hand to rally against you shows 
how much conﬁ  dence you had in yourself to 
win this argument in the ﬁ  rst place. 
  I mentioned the lacrosse team lost one 
player. That player, Caroline Cochran, played 
in just one game and recorded one assist last 
season before going down for the year with 
an ACL tear.  It shouldn’t be hard to ﬁ  nd 
someone to ﬁ  ll her void. The track team is 
losing Will Claye, AN OLYMPIC MEDAL-
IST. How do they replace him?
  
  Joe: Well, uh, Claye left after the 2011 sea-
son. So did Christian Taylor, who won a gold medal for Team USA in the triple jump at the London Olym-
pics. Replacing two Olympians last year, 
Omar Craddock 
won the Southeast-
ern Conference and 
national champion-
ships in the triple 
jump during both the indoor and out-
door seasons. Neither Claye nor Taylor ac-
complished that in a single season. Craddock 
is coming back this year. Prominent point 
scorers Jeremy Postin (weight throw/ham-mer throw), Eddie Lovett (hurdles) and Sean 
Obinwa (mid-distance runner) also return.
  UF loses heptathlon and decathlon com-
petitor Gray Horn and sprinter Jeff Demps from last year’s 
team, but Florida still managed to 
win its ﬁ  rst-ever 
NCAA outdoor title 
despite both former 
individual national 
champions missing 
the meet. The most signiﬁ  cant loss is sil-
ver medalist and three-time NCAA champion sprinter Tony McQuay, who decided to turn 
pro and forgo his senior season. Freshman 
Arman “Gino” Hall, one of the most prom-ising athletes in UF’s seventh-ranked recruit-
ing class, will replace McQuay in the 400m. Hall is the two-time defending FHSAA Class 
4A state champion in the 400m. This team is built for yet another national title run.
  
  Josh: All right, I might have had the athlete 
wrong, but track has to replace a different 
Olympian. Not only does the lacrosse team 
return everyone but Cochran, but it is enter-
ing this season signiﬁ  cantly healthier. When 
Florida opened last season at North Carolina, 
Shannon Gilroy was exactly eight months re-moved from suffering a left ACL tear in her 
ﬁ  nal high school game. She started the season 
still rehabbing the injury and scored just one 
goal in Florida’s ﬁ  rst three games.  
  She worked her way back to full strength 
and became the team’s most dominant player by the end of the season, scoring 16 goals in the ﬁ  nal four games. Seven of those goals 
came in the American Lacrosse Conference 
Tournament ﬁ  nal win against Northwestern 
and ﬁ  ve were against Syracuse in the Final 
Four. Having Gilroy at full-strength for the 
entire season will make what was already a formidable team in 2012 even scarier.
  
  Joe: So, lacrosse is good. We get it. But how 
many national championships has this team won? Zero. Granted, it’s a young program. The men’s track and ﬁ  eld squad has tallied 
four national titles since the lacrosse team played its ﬁ  rst season in 2010. Reaching a 
championship level of play quickly is one thing. Actually bringing home the hardware 
is another. With a spot in the title game seem-ingly in its grasp, Florida blew a seven-goal 
lead in a 14-13 overtime loss to Syracuse in last season’s Final Four. The ﬁ  rst title is al-
ways the hardest one to win. Ask the men’s 
track and ﬁ  eld squad. The Gators missed out on three straight NCAA outdoor crowns by a combined ﬁ  ve points before winning last sea-
son’s championship. Lacrosse is good enough 
to win it all, but getting over the hump is a 
daunting task. I’m not saying winning a na-
tional title in track and ﬁ  eld is any easier, but 
coach Mike Holloway’s club has tasted the 
ultimate prize before. And I like their chances 
again this year.
