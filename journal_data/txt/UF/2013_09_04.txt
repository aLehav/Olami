This season, as Gator fans gear up for 
football games by priding themselves in 
their orange-and-blue apparel, the lepidop-
terists at the Florida Museum of Natural 
History plan on showing pride unlike any-where else.
The staff at the Florida Museum will be 
releasing an inﬂ  ux of butterﬂ  y species that are either all orange or all blue this fall in the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest, celebrating the opening of Gator football season.
UF students receive free admission to the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest with a valid Gator 1 Card through Sept. 30, according to the Florida Museum website. Daily releases of butterﬂ  ies are at 2 p.m.
About every six weeks, the museum fol-
lows different themes for its exhibits. This is the second time the museum has hosted the orange-and-blue theme for the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest for football season.
However, despite the massive shipment 
of orange-and-blue butterﬂ  ies, Ryan Fessen-den, the assistant manager of Butterﬂ  y Rain-forest operations, notes that none of the but-Orange and blue fly high at

UF plans to build a $25 mil-
lion, 82,000-square-foot resi-
dence hall that would include 35 spaces for students with high levels of physical disabilities.
Vice President for Student 
Affairs Dave Kratzer said in a Finance and Facilities Commit-tee meeting with UF trustees Tuesday that the dorm, which would have 255 bed spaces total in suite-style rooms, would be near Yulee Hall and the Disabil-ity Resource Center. 
Across the street is the Col-lege of Education at Norman Hall, which just received a $25 million grant to study students with disabilities.
“ W e ’ r e 
looking at 
students that 
might have multiple chal-lenges, and maybe some disabled veter-
ans,” Kratzer said after the 
meeting.
The dorm will have accom-
modations for students with dis-abilities, including 8-foot-wide hallways so two wheelchairs can pass each other easily, said Associate Vice President and Director of Housing and Resi-dence Education Norb Dunkel. Elevator cabs will be oversized as well.
Kratzer said there will be 
room for caregivers as well as 
modiﬁ  ed kitchens so students 
can work on their own.
“There’s a lot of educational 
components in this building that have been carefully thought of,” he said after the meeting.
Some rooms will also have 
SureHands Lift and Care Sys-tems, which are mounted in the 
ceilings and help students move 
around the room and bathroom.UF asks for new-dorm money

The county government was recently as ranked the most-
efﬁ  cient local government in the Gainesville area because of 
the way it spends its money.
Greg Michels, who conducted the survey with Austin, 
Texas-based Municipal Analysis Services Inc., said the goal was to ﬁ  nd cities and counties that manage ﬁ  nances effec-tively.
“The result is an objective list of governments that are ﬁ  nancially efﬁ  cient with their citizens while being more ﬁ  -nancially stable,” he said.
The survey compares the amount of money taken in, the 
amount given to employees and the amount kept to run the government, Michels said. 
Data from the Alachua County government was com-
pared with data from the City of Alachua, the City of Gainesville and the City of Chieﬂ  and.
Alachua County received a score of 55, showing a high 
potential performance with the resources available, accord-ing to the data.
Alachua County scored 10 percentage points higher than 
any other city in the survey’s region.
The City of Chieﬂ  and scored second-highest in the area. 
Teal Pomeroy, Chieﬂ  and’s mayor-commissioner, attributed the score to new City Manager Kevin Gay.
Pomeroy said Chieﬂ  and will operate debt free for the fol-
lowing ﬁ  scal year and successfully received approval for the 
majority of its requested grants.
“Everything seems to be going real well,” Pomeroy said.Alachua County government ranked most efficient in areaSEE BUTTERFLY, PAGE 4

Morgan was a bright-eyed 18-
year-old when it happened.
At a party her freshman year at 
the University of Central Florida, 
she “got really drunk.” A guy she 
knew said he needed to talk to her, 
took her into a room, held her down and raped her.
One of his fraternity brothers 
heard her screams and came to help.
“I told one of the senior members 
of my sorority what happened, and she told me to keep quiet because 
Greek life didn’t need that kind of 
negative press,” she said.
Morgan, now 23, said the experi-
ence changed her life.
“I never spoke up, blamed my-
self and sunk into a deep depres-sion,” she said.
Morgan entered her sorority ex-
cited at the prospect of sisterhood. 
She left as a statistic.
…
There are 32,000 undergraduate 
students enrolled at UF. More than 
17,600 are women. Chances are, 4,400 have been or will be raped by the time they graduate, according to Geoffrey Lee, a psychologist at the University of Florida Counseling & Wellness Center.
One in four women will be raped 
while attending college, and the vast majority will not report the attack.
Why?
…
About a year ago in Steubenville, 
Ohio, a 16-year-old girl was raped by two high school football play-ers. Photos and videos of the assault were disseminated online.
Later, a CNN correspondent 
drew criticism after seemingly sym-pathizing with the rapists.
In the hazy light of the Steuben-
ville case, the term “rape culture” is reverberating through the nation’s vocabulary.
“The issue is the crime,” said Lau-
ra Templeton, a victim advocate for 
University Police. “Not what hap-
pened. Not what you were wearing, what you were drinking, what you were smoking. That should not be the focus.”
In college towns, rape thrives on 
a culture fueled by binge drinking. Templeton said 75 percent of cases involve alcohol.
…
Molly Ryan, a 22-year-old UF 
women’s studies alumna, was sit-ting on her porch in October when neighbors told her a woman was ly-ing naked, covered in blood next to a Dumpster on Fourth Avenue.
Ryan found her screaming hys-
terically, surrounded by people. One had draped a sheet over her.
“Her face was completely pound-
ed in,” Ryan said. “Her lip was the size of a golf ball.”
Ryan cradled the bleeding wom-
an in her arms until the police ar-rived. When they did, she said they 
asked Ryan to step away because 
she wasn’t family.
Instead of asking the woman 
what happened, their ﬁ  rst questions were: What’s your name? What’s your address? Do you have your li-cense on you?
Ryan said the woman kept re-
peating, “He raped me.”
She added that instead of rec-
ognizing the woman’s screams as a reaction to trauma, “He radioed, ‘Possible intoxication.’”
She said the ofﬁ  cers seemed more 
concerned that Ryan’s shirt was bloody than that a rape and robbery had occurred in broad daylight.
Gainesville Police Spokesman 
Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said he could not comment about this case speciﬁ  cally but that all ofﬁ  cers receive extensive training on how to deal with victims of sexual assault. The training begins during their education at the police academy and continues throughout their careers.
“We understand that these are very delicate situations for everyone 
involved,” Tobias said. “We make 
sure the victim is as comfortable as they can possibly be to minimize the trauma.”
Gainesville Police’s General Or-
der 40.1, which provides protocol for sexual battery investigations, directs ofﬁ  cers to “attempt to gain the victim’s trust and conﬁ  dence by 
showing understanding, patience 
and respect for personal dignity.”
Ryan said the evidence of rape 
culture lay not just in the ofﬁ  cers’ ac-tions but in the victim’s response.
“The woman kept screaming, 
‘Don’t tell my dad!’ She had already internalized shame and blame for the assault.” 
…
One of the biggest causes of rape 
and rape culture is a lack of space to discuss it, Ryan said.
“I think a lot of guys don’t under-
stand what rape is,” she said. “They 
see drunk girls and think it’s an in-
vitation. Why aren’t we teaching people not to rape?”
Deanna Pinzon, a 22-year-old UF 
English senior with a women’s stud-ies minor, agreed.
“At Preview, the ﬁ  rst thing they 
tell you is that you should take their RAD [rape aggression defense] 
class,” she said. “Instead of telling 
men that they shouldn’t rape wom-en and explaining the signs that a woman is unable to give proper consent, they just tell women how to protect themselves.”
Pinzon and Ryan said they be-
lieve there’s a need to educate men on the deﬁ  nitions of rape and con-sent. Both also said rape culture is 
placing the blame on women.
Erica Rodriguez Merrell, co-own-
er of Wild Iris Books, said her store 
opened in the 1970s “when women didn’t really have a place to gather.” The store is now a safe haven.
Merrell said Gainesville needs 
more safe arenas to change the dia-logue from one that feeds rape cul-
ture to one that diffuses it.
“The ﬁ  rst thing we need to do is 
stop with the victim blaming,” she 
said, “so that young women are not afraid to come forward because of the way they’re going to be put on trial.”
Ryan, Pinzon and Merrell said 
they believe prevention starts with 
open discussions and education.
“You know, whistles and blue 
lights on campus, I don’t know how 
well any of that works until we re-ally start decomposing these frame-works around sex and start having some healthy conversations,” Mer-rell said.
“You need to be telling men that 
they can’t touch a woman unless a woman wants to be touched,” Pin-zon said.National, local rape culture calls for change in conversationThe new dorm is based off of the Uni-
versity of Illinois’ Nugent Hall, which 
opened in 2010. Dunkel said that uni-versity went beyond the minimum stan-dards set by the Americans with Disabili-
ties Act. UF hopes to surpass it all.
Dunkel said UF housing gets about 10 
requests a year for accommodations but 
is only able to make a few happen.
Some families with students still in 
high school are already excited about UF’s efforts, Kratzer said.
“They’ve heard about this, and they’ve 
said, ‘Tell us more,’” Dunkel said.
But not all the rooms in the new dorm 
will be designated for students with dis-abilities. The new building will help “re-lieve the pressure” on the other dorms, Kratzer said.
The projected groundbreaking for the 
dorm is set for January. The tentative opening would be in August 2015.
The dorm’s cost per square foot is 
about $325. Students would pay about the same for rent as those living in Hume Hall, Kratzer said.
Later Tuesday, the Board of Trustees voted to authorize a request to the Board of Governors to approve the issuance of about $23.5 million in bonds. The remain-ing $1.5 million will be contributed by UF Housing. The Board of Governors next meets Sept. 12.terflies for this theme are native Florida 
species.
“The only native Florida species that 
might fit the criterion would be the atala,” Fessenden said. He said it is endangered and is being conserved in the museum’s Lepidoptera laboratory. But visitors are 
still able to view the atala through the 
laboratory window as part of the theme.
The museum is waiting for more ship-
ments of the orange-and-blue butterflies, and the staff is unsure when the ship-
ments will be arriving.
Despite the wait, visitor services staff 
member Josh Brewer said there are cur-
rently orange-and-blue butterflies in the 
Butterfly Rainforest.
“The most orange-and-blue one that 
we have is the Indian Leafwing,” Brewer 
said. “Also…the Olivewing will have kind of a blue slash on either wing, and under-
neath, it will have some orange spots.”
Museum staff predicts that as Gator 
football season progresses, the number of 
Gator football fans visiting the Butterfly Rainforest will increase.
Brewer said putting orange-and-blue 
flowers in the forest would add to the theme.
“You can get quite a different variety 
of flowering plants, so orange-and-blue 
would definitely be possible right now,” 
he said.
Fessenden also said visitors can see the 
orange-and-blue butterflies before and 
after a football game and hints that the 
theme is aimed towards families visiting Gainesville.
“Who doesn’t love butterflies?” Fes-
senden said. “And what’s better than an orange-and-blue butterfly?”Staff waiting

Gainesville Police released a sur-
veillance video Tuesday of a mid-
August armed robbery at a local barbecue restaurant.
Police are still looking for a man 
who robbed David’s Real Pit BBQ, located at 521 NE 23rd Ave., wrote GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.
The surveillance video shows 
the man entering the restaurant through a back service-door, hold-ing a bag and wearing a black jack-et, mask and gray pants. 
He took out a handgun and 
pointed it at an employee, who was mopping the floors in a backroom.
In the video, the worker glances 
back and forth a few times before dropping the mop and walking out of the frame with the robber.
Once they were out of the frame, 
the robber demanded all of the cash from the register and took two em-ployees’ cellphones. 
He placed the phones under a 
counter before leaving the store and took the cash with him, Tobias wrote.
An officer and police dog tracked 
a scent southwest toward McCoy Court Apartments with no results. 
Another officer noted that 
around the same time as the rob-
bery, he saw a cream-colored SUV 
speeding south down Northeast Second Street then west on 16th Avenue.
The robber was described as a 
medium-built black man, about 35 to 40 years old.Police still looking for

As Santa Fe College 
renewed faculty contracts at 
the onset of the 2013-2014 
academic year, faculty and 
staff received another raise.
But unlike previous years 
when employees sometimes 
received flat-rate bonuses, 
the beginning of this academic year brought a 5 percent increase in wages for all of the college’s full-time 
employees.
Part-time staff, which 
includes all student workers, 
received a 3 percent raise.
In 2012, full-time 
employees received under half that amount, with a 2 percent increase on their base salary.Every year, the college 
tries to give some sort of an increase to its employees, said Lela Frye, director of 
human resources at SFC.
“They are our most 
important resource,” Frye 
said.
Stacey Ledvina, a recruiter 
at the SFC admission office, said SFC President Jackson Sasser fights for faculty and staff perks every year when 
he gives his proposal for the 
budget.
“He always makes us feel 
appreciated, but this was just a little bit extra,” Ledvina 
said.
Santa Fe was able to afford 
these salary increases with 
no impact on tuition costs.
Frye said the college isn’t working with a bigger budget.
It’s simply using the  
money in different ways and places.
“Raises like this come 
from a reallocation of existing 
resources,” Frye said.
Olyvia Heinz, a 17-year-
old SFC nursing student who 
works as a receptionist at the Santa Fe Watson Center, 
said she wasn’t aware of the 
raise, but she does welcome the extra cash.
“I think it’s helpful,” 
she said. “I pay for my own gasoline ... so a little bit of extra doesn’t hurt.”Santa Fe College raises wages

Best-selling author James Patterson has recently helped a few 
UF students solve the mystery of how to pay for college.
The author — set to release a book later this month —  recently 
donated $48,000 to UF’s College of Education via his philanthropy 
organization, the Patterson Family Foundation.
The money created eight scholarships for eight elementary edu-
cation majors, said Maria Gutierrez Martin, senior director of de-velopment at the College of Education.
Shannan Campbell, a 19-year-old UF elementary education 
freshman, was one of the scholarship recipients. She said she felt relieved when she found out she’d won.
“I am unable to receive help from my family,” she said. “They 
don’t have the ability to help me financially.”
Campbell, who is a full-time student and a full-time employee at Chili’s restaurant, said she is grateful Patterson made the funds available, and she said she hopes he continues to donate money to 
other colleges as well.
Each recipient will receive $6,000. To contin-
ue receiving the money, they must write a yearly 
essay describing how they plan to use what they learn in college, Martin said.
“It’s a great example of a person who has 
been successful in his career,” she said. “He and his wife want to support and give back to areas that they find meaningful.”
UF is not the only school that Patterson has 
donated money to. According to his website, the 
Patterson Family Foundation awards scholarships to about 20 col-leges nationwide every year.
Elizabeth Bondy, director of the School of Teaching and Learn-
ing in the college, said she believed Patterson chose to donate mon-ey to UF’s College of Education because of its innovative teaching program.James Patterson donates scholarship fundsNo impact on tuition

A two-vehicle crash in southwest 
Gainesville on Sunday night sent one 
person to the hospital and forced city police ofﬁ  cers to close an area of 
Southwest 34th Street for two hours.
The crash happened at about 8 
p.m. near the intersection of South-west 34th Street and Southwest 39th 
Boulevard, said Gainesville Police Spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
A 1999 Lincoln sedan driven 
by 36-year-old Rasheed Walters 
slammed into a 2010 Honda from be-
hind at a “high rate of speed.” 
The collision caused the cars to 
spin off the road into nearby woods, 
Tobias said.
Walters was reportedly pinned 
inside his car and knocked uncon-scious. The other driver, 19-year-old William R. Benner III, of Longwood, 
did not suffer any serious injuries, Tobias said.
When ofﬁ  cers and Gainesville 
Fire Rescue crews arrived, they cut Walters’ car open to get him out. An ambulance then rushed him to UF Health Shands Hospital on the 1500 block of Southwest Archer Road.
Meanwhile, ofﬁ  cers halted trafﬁ  c 
for two hours along Southwest 34th Street between Southwest 35th Place and Southwest 39th Boulevard.
After Walters arrived at the hospi-
tal, doctors listed him in stable condi-tion. A hospital ofﬁ  cial said Tuesday that Walters had been released from treatment.
Tobias said police were still inves-
tigating the crash.Crash on 34th Street

The City of Gainesville is offering classes 
for the Fall semester, too.
Applications opened last week for the 
Citizens’ Academy: Gainesville 101, an 
educational program designed to increase awareness of the inner workings of local government, said Laura Rawson, communi-
cations and marketing assistant for the City 
of Gainesville.
It will begin Oct. 16 and run through 
Nov. 20.
Residents will visit different locations 
throughout the city each week, including Gainesville Police, the public works build-ing and the Gainesville Fire Rescue, Raw-son said.
“In a sense, we try to avoid ofﬁ  ces and make it more interactive,” she said. “We don’t visit every department, but the ones that most likely would impact someone’s day-to-day life.”
Although 30 people may seem like a 
small class size, Rawson said, limiting the amount of participants ensures quality in-teraction.
“We had about 45 people in the past but 
learned that 30 is the sweet spot,” she said. “That allows attendees to get to know each other and the city staff. It allows people to establish relationships with each other.”
Beth A. Rosenson, a UF political science 
associate professor, said the program is helpful.
“Even as a political science professor, I 
don’t know the nitty-gritty about the inner 
workings of the government,” she said. “If 
the ideal for democracy is an informed citi-zenry, I think this contributes to that goal.”

ment at Tuesday night’s Stu-
dent Senate meeting grew into a greater discussion about academic classiﬁ  ca-tion.
Some senators were 
skeptical about appointing Brooke Liston, a 20-year-old pre-nursing sophomore with 
more than 60 credits, to an 
open nursing Senate seat. 
She’s on track to apply for 
UF’s nursing school’s accel-erated program, but she has 
not been accepted yet.
According to SG elections 
codes, a candidate’s classiﬁ  -cation is determined by the 
UF Registrar’s records. 
Although Liston won’t 
know of her acceptance into 
the program until Spring, 
she is listed in the registrar as a 3NR because of her cred-it hours. 
She is therefore eligible to 
be a nursing senator.
Liston, a Cicerone and 
a Delta Zeta sister, said she was qualiﬁ  ed because of her 
membership in the Nursing 
Student Association.
“Just because you’re not 
in the College of Nursing doesn’t mean you can’t rep-
resent well,” she said after 
the meeting.
Out of the two candidates who applied for the seat, 
Sen. Davis Bean, a voting 
member of the Replacement and Agenda Committee, said Liston’s experience as a par-liamentarian stood out.
The other candidate was 
a student currently in the nursing program.
Sen. Daniella Saetta, who 
is also in the Replacement and Agenda Committee, 
voted against Liston’s nomi-
nation. 
Saetta’s vote was defeated 
4-to-1.
“The problem here is that 
she was in a sorority, and the other candidate was not,” she said after the meeting.
Liston’s appointment was 
conﬁ  rmed by the Senate. 
Her term will go through 
Spring.Student Senate appointment calls classiﬁ  cation into question

Paynes Prairie?To ﬁ  x Washington, close ‘revolving door’
A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling in Janu-
ary found that a whopping 85 percent of Ameri-
cans distrust their member of Congress. In June, 
Gallup reported a Congressional approval rating of just 10 percent.
More Americans than ever view their government as 
out-of-touch, corrupt and more likely to cater to the de-sires of the wealthy’s special interests than those of the 
average citizen.
One of the most signiﬁ  cant examples of corruption in 
American politics is the “revolving-door” system. 
The revolving door involves members of Congress and 
the executive branch who serve the wealthy interests that fund their campaigns and support their nominations. 
Upon their retirement from public service, those same 
wealthy interests reward faithful politicians with high-paying jobs as lobbyists and executives.
One well-known participant in the system was Robert 
Rubin, former board member of Goldman Sachs and sec-
retary of the treasury during the Clinton administration. 
Rubin was one of the most forceful advocates for deregu-
lation of Wall Street that took place in the ﬁ  nal months of 
the Clinton administration.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, a bill for which 
Rubin forcefully advocated, repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, a law put in place during the Great Depression to 
prevent future ﬁ  nancial crises.
As a reward for his loyal service to Wall Street, Rubin 
was given a position at Citigroup as director, a job for 
which he received salary and stock options worth about 
$126 million. Meanwhile, Rubin’s support for deregula-
tion of Wall Street led to the ﬁ  nancial crisis of 2007 and 
the subsequent recession, resulting in unemployment, 
economic stagnation and poverty from which America 
will need years to recover.
A more recent participant in the revolving-door sys-
tem is Billy Tauzin. Tauzin served as a member of Con-gress from Louisiana for 25 years before retiring in 2005. 
One of Tauzin’s signature achievements before his re-tirement was guiding the Medi-
care prescription drug beneﬁ  t 
bill through Congress. The bill, 
which was signed into law by 
George W. Bush in 2003, ensured 
a new source of revenue for 
pharmaceutical companies.
Just as Rubin was rewarded 
for his faithful service, Tauzin 
became the head of Pharmaceu-
tical Research and Manufacturers of America, the ultra-powerful lobbying group for the drug industry, upon his 
retirement from Congress. 
In 2010, Tauzin earned $11.6 million from his position 
as president within the group.
Tauzin would later play a signiﬁ  cant role in the craft-
ing of the Affordable Care Act — commonly known as Obamacare — to ensure the law favored pharmaceutical 
companies as much as possible.
Although the corruption in Washington is pervasive, 
possible solutions exist.
One measure to ﬁ  x the revolving-door system would 
require members of Congress and the executive branch to wait a set period of time — about ﬁ  ve to seven years 
— before allowing them to work for organizations they 
regulated during their time in government.
Another possible solution is the implementation of 
term limits for members of Congress. 
This would prevent well-funded special interests from 
establishing close relationships with elected ofﬁ  cials and 
unduly inﬂ  uencing their decision-making. Finally, and 
most importantly, a system of public campaign ﬁ  nancing 
should be instituted to prevent money from exerting a 
greater inﬂ  uence on elected ofﬁ  cials than votes. 
Public ﬁ  nancing would ensure that members of Con-
gress are focused on the needs of their constituents and not on fundraising for their next campaign.

Why James Franco is 
a marketing maverick
Say what you want about James Franco, but it’s impossible 
to pigeonhole the man.
During the Comedy Central “Roast of James Franco” 
on Sunday night, a panel of comedians ﬁ  red a number of shots at the actor-slash-professional squinter — his grand ﬂ  op as an 
Oscar host, his questionably questionable sexuality and his odd 
career choices.
Seth Rogen summed it up nicely: “Who is the real James 
Franco? Is he an artist? Is he an actor? Is he a scholar? He’s tough to pin down; although I’ve heard many guys have been able to do it.”
The roast was, predictably, full of super-original gay jokes 
and jabs at Franco for not following the Hollywood-heartthrob formula.
Jonah Hill said, “You know how you always hear George 
Clooney and other big movie stars saying, ‘My philosophy for making movies is: one for them and one for me.’ But not my guy James. James is a rebel. He has his own philosophy on this: one for them, ﬁ  ve for nobody.”
Hill has a point: James Franco is a West Coast WASP jack-
of-all-trades. In addition to appearing on-screen across an im-probable range of characters — from assorted bad-boy roles to Allen Ginsberg and Harvey Milk’s lover — he’s dabbled in art, 
received a master of ﬁ  ne arts in creative writing and contributes 
to Vice magazine regularly.
Franco has done what few celebrities manage to do: He 
avoided a predictable, prepackaged image.
A key aspect of achieving celebrity is marketing a speciﬁ  c im-
age, and this isn’t a new concept. The members of the rock band Kiss branded themselves with the infamous face paint, One Di-rection has capitalized on the boy-band brand, Clint Eastwood perfected the sneering-cowboy brand and every child star un-
der the Disney umbrella must carry himself or herself as — you 
guessed it — part of the scrubbed-clean Disney brand.
Branding is such an integral part of celebrity marketing be-
cause celebrities are essentially products. According to www.About.com’s marketing page, branding delivers a message, con-nects to a targeted audience’s emotions, motivates buyers and concretes user loyalty.
Of course, it’s a totally stupid concept once you think about 
it, especially when applied to people. People, even celebrities, 
are multifaceted. It’s like that one episode of “America’s Next 
Top Model” when Tyra Banks assigned her contestants vague buzzwords to help their images — words like “daring,” “can-did” and “free.” The contestants then spent the rest of the epi-sode worrying about grooming themselves into ﬁ  tting their as-signed roles.
Branding may establish consumer loyalty and help celebri-
ties score product endorsement deals, but it’s a disservice to the human beings who are stuffed into a one-dimensional role.
Franco may be kind of a tool, but at least he’s unpredictable 
— and has a humorous sense of self-awareness.
In closing the roast, Franco said, “I think this is truly my pun-
ishment for the Oscars.”

You’re probably sunburned beyond recognition from 
Labor Day weekend, still nursing the hangover you’ve been avoiding since the Friday pregame. Slowly, the 
haze is clearing from your college football festivities, and you’re just barely slogging through your classes. Back to re-
ality — and I hate to tell you this, but it’s not pretty.
I shouldn’t discredit how informed we are as college stu-
dents, though — I’m sure everyone knows that on Thurs-
day, President Barack Obama announced he planned to use 
a limited number of precise missile strikes to attack Syria 
in response to a chemical attack that killed more than 1,400 
civilians two weeks ago. On Tuesday, Congress will come 
back from its summer recess, quite like our sunburned, col-legiate bunch, to decide whether to give Obama the green 
light to strike the Syrian government and military — and 
possibly ﬂ  ick the ﬁ  rst domino in a winding path of interna-tional consequences.
If the U.S. was declaring war on the Syrian government 
to deﬁ  nitively end the conﬂ  ict that has killed more than 100,000 people in the last two years, it would be in our best 
interest to keep these strategies a secret and hit them when 
they least expect it then send in our own troops, costing lives and money the American public doesn’t want to lose. But the White House is being purposefully transparent — 
and we’re not ending the conﬂ  ict ourselves.
Iraq is still fresh in our memories and vocabulary. What 
we’ve heard in the news about Syria strikes a nerve: weap-
ons of mass destruction, evil dictators, rebel insurgencies and extremist factions. It’s easy to compare apples to orang-
es if they’re both rotten.
A search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq result-
ed in a full-blown war that has scarred our country domes-
tically and tarnished our international image. But please, while we wait for Congress to make a decision, let’s think a 
little further than what our memories may allow.
Syria is an incredibly complex country made of many 
different religious and cultural entities. Most citizens are Sunni Muslims, while Bashar al-Assad and his government 
are Alawites, another Muslim sect. While diversity of reli-gion has not been a severe problem like in other countries 
in the Middle East, Assad’s authoritative regime and that of 
his father before him have set up Syria for civil war. A pro-test spurred by the Arab Spring against the government was shut down mercilessly in 2011, 
starting a massacre with no end 
in sight — even if we do attack 
Syria.
Obama’s decisions so far have 
been criticized from both sides 
harshly — to the Syrians and 
the Arab League, he’s not doing 
enough to balance out the conﬂ  ict to give the rebels a chance to ﬁ  ght against Assad. Russia and Iran are breathing down 
our necks, trying to protect the most powerful military base in the region from an American attack. And now it’s our 
turn as Americans to voice an opinion.
When we think about the possibility of striking Syria in 
the next week or two — whether  or not we agree with that 
— let’s not call this a humanitarian action. We are neither 
capable of saving Syrians from the bloodshed they’ve ex-
perienced daily for the last two years, nor are we able to 
stop the destruction of amazing historic cities like Aleppo 
and Damascus. We can’t guarantee that refugees from the conﬂ  ict will have a better life in the camps set up all over the region. 
We can’t save the world anymore, and we shouldn’t 
have to try.
America has long attempted to act as a white knight and 
tried to bestow democracy upon other nations — regard-less of what those other nations want. I could mention most 
wars in the past 40 years to demonstrate this kind of holier-
than-thou thinking. Save X from X because we can, because 
we’re America.
At this point, our involvement is a political statement to 
punish Assad and deter future leaders from using weapons of mass destruction. However, a solution in Syria is not go-
ing to come from us. It’s an international responsibility to help Syria get back on their feet once the conﬂ  ict comes to 
a close. For now, all we can do is give Syria the opportu-
nity to ﬁ  ght a fair battle for the liberty they deserve. That’s American.

According to the De-
partment of Labor, in 1884, the ﬁ  rst Monday 
in September was selected to commemorate Labor Day, a “workingmen’s holiday.”
Currently, Labor Day is 
dedicated to spending any leftover summer savings shopping at the mall. Labor Day afternoons are con-secrated to gaining a few pounds thanks to generous barbecue pit masters, and for American children, the 
holiday marks the beginning of the school year. What 
better way to end summer?
The Department of Labor says the holiday is a 
“tribute to the contributions workers have made to 
the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our coun-
try.”
Time to call the emperor naked: Everyone knows 
we’re not prospering. We’re hurting. Our work-ers, our families and our country are all hurting.  I 
know what you’re thinking — “Dude, aren’t we like 
the richest country in the world? We have the high-est gross domestic product, rivaled only by the entire European Union.”
Sure, the U.S. has tons of money — about a ﬁ  fth of 
all global dough. However, in context of Labor Day, the deserving Americans are broke.
The U.S. has the highest income inequality in the 
developed world. When the CIA ﬁ  nancial rankings 
report that America is more unequal of a society than 
Iran, Uganda and Nigeria, it’s time we do a bit of self-evaluation.
How did we even get here? How did we get to the 
point that 400 individuals in this country have more wealth than the bottom half of America — 150 mil-lion people combined? How did we become a na-tion where the top 1 percent controls 40 percent of all wealth, while the bottom 80 percent of Americans 
have only 7 percent? This is economic insanity.
Why is America hurting today? 
Robert Reich, the legendary economist who served 
both Republican and Democratic presidents, said, 
“The economy is in trouble because so much income 
and wealth have been going to the top that the rest us no longer have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services we would produce at or near full employment.”
In 1968, when the unemployment rate was less 
than half of what it is today, Americans working at the minimum wage enjoyed $10.74 an hour — adjust-ed for inﬂ  ation. Today’s minimum wage workers in 
Florida toil at a meager $7.79.
This is absurd, especially at a time when the com-
panies’ shareholders rake in billions of dollars in prof-
its — see Walmart and McDonald’s — without ever breaking a sweat.
Roughly 80 percent of Americans want to increase 
the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. Con-gress continues to ignore the public opinion, but how can you expect politicians to bite the hand from Wall 
Street that feeds them?
Reich summed it up: “Americans know a rigged 
game when they see one. They understand how much 
money is ﬂ  owing into politics from the super rich, big corporations and Wall Street — in order to keep their 
taxes low and entrench their privileged position.”
Although an in-depth look at Labor Day can dis-
hearten us, let’s try to be grateful. After all, our eco-
nomic woes pale in comparison to the dread experi-
enced by millions of innocent children who shiver in 
the late hours of Labor Day as the specter of the next school day looms over them.

A recent study co-researched by 
UF professor Madan Oli estimates 
that caring for wild horses could cost taxpayers about $1 billion by 2030.
Oli, a professor in the wildlife 
ecology and conservation depart-ment, was chosen by a national committee to study the issue. He said there are about 33,000 wild horses roaming the western U.S., and 45,000 more have been removed by the government.
“The law requires them to get rid 
of these horses,” Oli said. “But then the question is, what do you do with them?”
The law says the excess horses 
must be euthanized in “the most humane and cost-effective way pos-sible,” he said. But because of public pressure, most of these horses go to long-term holding facilities owned by private ranchers.
“It’s almost like heaven for 
them,” Oli said. “They’re used to dry Midwest land, and then all of a sudden, they’re in a place with a lot 
of forest, a lot of water and veteri-
nary care.”
Ranchers are paid to care for these 
horses until their natural death, said Oli. Most of the horses are rounded up at the average age of 7 and live until they are about 30 years old.
The UF study showed that the 
Bureau of Land Management pays 
the ranchers an estimated $1,000 per 
horse; per year, which quickly adds up, he said. However, in Gainesville, the money spent on the Paynes Prai-rie horses represents a “very mini-mal” section of the park’s budget, said park manager David Jowers.
“They are treated just like the deer and the other wildlife that’s out there,” he said. “They’re basically on their own.”
Jowers said there are about 40 
horses on Paynes Prairie, and their 
population is kept in check through 
occasional neutering. In the Mid-west, it’s a different story. In an ef-fort to reduce the horse population, the bureau has turned to contracep-tive vaccines made from pig stom-achs.
“What’s expensive and compli-
cated about that is the delivery,” 
said Oli. “You have to round up all 
the horses and hand inject it.”
Adding to the difficulty, the 
horse population in the wild triples every eight years, he said.
Even in Paynes Prairie, the popu-
lation is still climbing, Jowers said.
“I think they’re probably slowly 
increasing,” he said. “They are still 
reproducing but not at the rate at 
which they would be if we had not reduced their reproductive capac-ity.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2013

� THERE IS A WAITING 
LIST OF MORE THAN 100 STUDENTS.
CHRISTINE FLAMMIA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although more than 200 
minority students have been 
assigned mentors through the University Minority Mentor Program, other students might 
have to make the transition to 
UF without a guide.
Currently, there is a wait-
ing list of more than 100 stu-dents.
The program is designed 
to help minority students as-similate into the UF culture by matching him or her with a 
mentor. Currently, 178 faculty 
and staff members have signed on to mentor 279 students for the 2013-14 academic year, di-rector Jarrod Cruz said.
Cruz said making sure 
each student is partnered with a mentor has been an ongoing problem. He said he doesn’t 
know if the remaining stu-
dents will receive a mentor.
“Our program tries to 
fill a void on the university campus,” Cruz said. “Unfor-tunately, we are not able to match every single student to a mentor.”
The number of mentors de-
termines the eligible number of mentees.
Mentor applications are 
still being accepted until the end of September.
“I think the most important 
thing is feeling connected to the university community,” Cruz said. “There’s just so many op-
tions, they don’t know what 
best to get involved with.”
Program Manager Laura 
Weissbaum said she knows firsthand how overwhelming 
starting college can be to a 
student who doesn’t have the guidance of college-educated 
parents.
Weissbaum said she can 
empathize with the students 
because of her personal ex-perience as a first-generation student.
“It really took me awhile to 
get settled and really be able to figure out where I was go-
ing and what I was doing,” 
Weissbaum said. “Mentors are something I really believe in.”
The program offers help 
from both faculty and staff mentors as well as student transition ambassadors. Re-ceiving help from both areas of expertise allows the mentees 
to get the best of both worlds, 
Weissbaum said.
Ambassadors serve as re-
sources for a group of 10 to 15 mentees and a link between 
the mentors and the mentees, 
according to the program’s website.
“We are their guides,” said 
20-year-old transition ambas-sador Carlos Garcia Galindo, a UF microbiology and cell 
science senior. “They’re look-
ing up to you to know all the 
answers.”
Ambassadors and mentees 
are matched up based on simi-lar academic interests.
Because the students he 
works with are taking classes similar to the ones he took at UF, he said he is able to have a relevant and hands-on ap-proach to the students’ learn-
ing.
“I think the most important 
part is seeing their growth, see-
ing that they’ve stayed,” Cruz said. “They’ve committed to the University of Florida and receiving that degree.”Mentors in minority

Residents of the Sunshine State — par-
ticularly millennials — are driving less, and 
Gainesville residents are reflecting the trend.
A recent study by the Florida Public Inter-
est Research Group Education Fund found 
that the number of miles Floridians drive is 
down by about 11 percent since 2005.
The change in the number of miles logged 
per person is more than the the change in the national average, which was about 7 percent, according to a news release.
Dalyn Houser, an associate with the re-
search organization that conducted the study, said the findings are interesting because they 
show that a decrease in driving isn’t linked to 
the 2008 economic recession.
According to the study, driving rates have 
been declining for eight consecutive years in 46 states. During that period, only six states saw faster-than-average increases in unem-ployment as driving decreased.
“If (the recession) is over, it’s not just going 
to go back to normal,” Houser said. “It doesn’t matter that we had an economic downturn. It doesn’t matter that fuel costs are rising. The implication of this is that policymakers need 
to wake up and support policies that will lead 
to more public transportation in the area.”
She said millennials make up about 30 per-
cent of the U.S. population, and they are the group policymakers need to focus new policy decisions around.
The generation is driving about 25 percent 
less and using public transit 40 percent more than their counterparts eight years ago, ac-
cording to a Florida Public Interest Research 
Group Education Fund study.
“These people are the ones that are choos-
ing not to drive, and that is what’s causing this driving boom to be over,” she said.
Although Gainesville is still prone to traffic 
jams, many students and residents are choos-ing not to drive and instead use alternative modes of transportation.
Ron Fuller, assistant director of UF Trans-
portation and Parking Services, wrote in an email that parking decal sales for the UF cam-pus are down almost across the board.
The only annual passes that saw an increase 
from 2011 to 2013 were motorcycle and scooter 
decals, which increased by about 8 percent.
The local bus system reflects a similar pat-
tern.
Regional Transit System has seen rider-
ship numbers almost double in the last decade 
from about 5.2 million in 2000 to an average of about 10 million a year in the last few years, according to RTS ridership statistics.
During the first five months of this year, 
there were about 4 million passengers, accord-ing to the ridership data.
Looking toward the future, Houser said as 
millennials choose to drive less, they will also be the driving force to ensure money goes to-ward improving public transportation.
Twenty-one-year-old Maria Pazos said she 
mostly walks and takes the bus because she doesn’t have a car. But the UF English senior  said she wouldn’t give up those habits even if she did have her own wheels.
She also said she understood the trend 
of driving less, and she hopes cities like Gainesville will put more effort into improv-ing public transportation.
“Besides the environmental effects, we are 
definitely dependent on (driving),” she said. “But in a city like Gainesville, where there’s plenty of public transportation, there’s no rea-son not to take advantage.” Gainesville residents slow down on driving miles, follow state trend
“The implication of this is that 
policymakers need to wake up 
and support policies that will lead 
to more public transportation                           
in the area.”

Five UF students will take flight in the 
National Red Bull Flugtag Miami, a human-
powered flying competition.
Max Famiglietti, Jon Kistemaker, Chris 
Roda, Aaron Alanguilan and Rocky Flood 
are building a flying craft that will represent 
their group, the Gator Aviators, at the Sept. 21 competition.
The group submitted a design of a UF-
themed flying machine in the beginning of June.
“Our first design was like a flying biscuit, 
but then we were like, no, let’s take this se-riously,” said Alanguilan, a 20-year-old me-
chanical engineering junior.
The design features a gator head on a cart 
that will drop to the water when Famiglietti 
is pushed off the platform to take flight.
Famiglietti, a 22-year-old mechanical en-
gineering senior, is the team pilot. The other four  members will push the craft and launch Famiglietti off a pier over the waters of Bis-cayne Bay.
“I tried to get a pilot’s lesson before the 
event, like in a real plane, but I don’t think that it’s going to happen,” Famiglietti said.
He will control the movement of the rear wings in hopes of making the glider lift up 
and fly over the water.
“We have a lot of faith in Max’s timing,” Alanguilan said.
Four of the five members of the team are 
engineering majors, but they attribute their ability to build the craft to other things.
“Our education definitely helped with the 
wing design,” Alanguilan said.
Roda, a 22-year-old mechanical and aero-
space engineering senior, came up with the 
dimensions and design of the wings.
“We’ve built all types of stuff. I learned 
everything from my dad and life,” Famigli-etti said.
But the team has faced limitations balanc-
ing a budget.
“Time, resources and overall money. If we 
had a bigger budget,  we’d be ready to go,” Alanguilan said.
Because their craft can only be flown once 
at the event, the boys are focusing on details to make the craft fly and using alternative practice methods.
“I’ve been to Bob’s River Place and jumped 
out of a few trees, if you want to count that,” Famiglietti said.
The Gator Aviators are one of 28 teams 
chosen from 200 applicants to compete in the event.
The group heads to Miami on Sept. 20 to 
take flight. They’ll have until noon Sept. 21 to assemble and prepare for takeoff. They can’t use any power tools to alter their craft.
“Confidence is key,” Famiglietti said. 
“We’re going to fly.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

The Center for Leader-
ship and Service has ramped 
up its promotion of UF’s four student-run mentoring pro-grams, causing a spike in in-terest from UF students.
The programs, which in-
volve UF students mentoring at-risk children from 11 lo-cal schools, are anticipated to expand this year from about 370 mentors to more than 400, said Daniel Sibol, the commu-nity engagement coordinator for the center.
Sibol said he was expecting 
an increase in student interest but was still surprised by the number of people who attend-ed the first information ses-sion Thursday. Usually only about 60 students come.
“We had more than 150 
people there,” he said. “That’s the best kind of response we have ever seen from the com-munity.”
Sibol cited the beefed-up 
mentoring program promo-tions as the reason for the boost in student interest.  
“I think we have made 
some very intentional efforts this year to do more targeted outreach — to reach out to students we think would be receptive to our message and be interested in joining our programs,” he said.
The center used email, so-
cial media, electronic news-letters and an expanded ex-ecutive board to get the word out.
Students can volunteer for 
one of the four student-run mentoring programs: After School Gators, Project MAS-COT, Motiv8 and Gator Teens Mentors.
Project MASCOT Director 
Caitlyn LoMonte, a UF adver-tising and women’s studies major, said the programs are becoming so popular because they are more than just a vol-unteering experience, espe-cially for freshmen.
“It’s a great way to not 
only give back to at-risk stu-dents but also to become more involved in the Gainesville community,” she said.
Karlee Swisher, a UF nurs-
ing freshman, is one of the many students applying to be a part of the programs.
Swisher wants to volun-
teer for Gator Teens Mentors, which reaches out to at-risk high school students.
“I didn’t have anyone to lis-
ten to me when I was younger, and I want to be that person for someone,” she said.

sessions will be held today and Thursday at 6 p.m.Mentor programs at

New legislation passed this sum-
mer could affect people who rely on 
student loans.
The Bipartisan Student Loan Cer-
tainty Act of 2013 was signed Aug. 
9 by President Barack Obama to 
regulate student loan interest rates at about 3.9 percent for undergradu-ates.
Interest rates doubled from 3.4 
to 6.8 percent when Congress made no action by July 1 to maintain or control interest rates for subsidized student loans.
The new law links interest rates 
to financial markets, so students 
who choose to borrow money this 
year will lock in an interest rate of 3.9 percent. The rate could change depending on the economy.
More than half of UF graduates 
leave with no student loan debt, ac-cording to UF’s facts and rankings webpage. Those who do owe about $17,000 on average. The national av-
erage is about $27,000.
“Our students tend to find jobs, which also allows us to have a much 
lower default rate than the national average,” said Rick Wilder, director 
of UF Student Financial Affairs.
But debt can cause some students 
to delay plans for their future.
“I need a new car, but in the back 
of my mind I know I have thou-
sands of dollars to pay back starting in six months,” said Amy Newton, a 23-year-old UF master’s of public health alumna who graduated last 
month.
Newton said student borrowers 
need to be careful.
“Those loans will follow them 
into their financial future and ca-
reer,” she said.Loan regulations might lower rates

TAYLOR GAINES

A small human skull adorns the desk of associate 
chair of the Department of English Stephanie A. Smith. 
Colorful beakers are scattered throughout the room.
Smith said the space reflects her love of “Sherlock 
Holmes,” one of her favorite book series. An author her-
self, Smith will be at the Library West cafe lounge to-
night at 6 p.m. to chat with students about what it’s like to be published.
At the Authors@UF event, Smith will focus on her 
own characters and read from her “Warpaint” trilogy.
Smith, who has penned six novels and two works of 
criticism, said she plans to focus primarily on the trilogy during the event.
“I want people to walk out and say, ‘I want to read 
that book,’” she said.
The event is free, and refreshments will be served.A literature professor at UF for 24 years, Smith had 
her first novel published when she was 21.
She said she has never struggled with writer’s block. 
When working, she will sit down for two to three hours a day and just write.
“Some days you write one sentence. Some days you 
write 10 pages,” Smith said. “Some days you write 10 pages and throw them all out.”
After writing her third novel, Smith decided she wanted to take her career in a different direction, and she began to work in historical fiction.
“I just didn’t want to spend most of my time invent-
ing worlds,” she said. 
Although it cost her the stability of a publisher, her 
new pursuit led to the beginning of the “Warpaint” tril-ogy.
The trilogy led to the novels “Warpaint,” “Baby 
Rocket” and “Content Burns.”
Kenneth Kidd, professor and chair of the English de-
partment, said he enjoyed Smith’s work.
The trilogy deals with identity and characters discov-
ering who they are, he said.
Isabel Silver, one of the organizers of the Authors@
UF program, said she was thrilled Smith was available.
“It’s an excellent opportunity to talk to someone who 
is productive and interesting,” she said.
Smith plans to begin work on another trilogy follow-
ing the release of “Content Burns.” The books will focus on characters who have reached a point in their lives where they need to reinvent themselves.
“The books are really about finding yourself again,” 
she said.English professor to bring trilogy to life
“Some days you write one sentence. 
Some days you write 10 pages.”

Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
 Florida offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease hears what people say 
about his offense. But when describ-ing his scheme, stay away from one adjective in particular.
“First off, I don’t know what 
vanilla … I’ve heard the word va-nilla. I don’t know what vanilla is,” Pease said. “I’ve never made a game plan with vanilla. It’s never what I would go into with a game plan. I would feel too uncomfortable say-ing, ‘We’ve got to save all this, save all that.’”
Pease’s alleged “vanilla” scheme 
worked for the Gators in a 24-6 win against Toledo.
Florida tallied 262 rushing yards 
on 48 carries for a 68.6 percent rush rate that ranks third in the South-eastern Conference. The Gators also hogged the football and ranked sec-ond in the nation with a 39:48 time 
of possession after Week 1.
But UF’s passing attack gained 
only 153 yards and ranks 94th na-
tionally after one week of play. The Gators struggled in the vertical pass-ing game last season, and Toledo’s quarters coverage caused Pease to rely more on check-down throws.
Still, Florida showed potential 
through the air and on the ground with nine “explosive plays.” UF tags running plays that gain 12 yards or more and passing plays of 16 yards or more as “explosive plays.” But the yardage gained by a play is of 
less consequence to Pease than its 
ultimate result — a ﬁ  rst down or a touchdown.“I’m not measuring it on yards,” 
Pease said. “That’s called, ‘You’re trying to get your guru card.’ Maybe when I was 30 years old, but I’m not 30 years old anymore.”
The offensive focus relies solely 
on winning, but senior wide receiver Trey Burton, who led the team with ﬁ  ve catches for 69 yards on Satur-day, believes UF is capable of more.
“There’s a lot more potential,” 
Burton said. “Off the top of my head, I can think of 17 points that we left on the ﬁ  eld. We didn’t capitalize on those opportunities. Hopefully, in the future, we can put up more points. But we’re just worried about wins right now.”
Pease praised one play in par-
ticular from freshman wide receiver Ahmad Fulwood. Fulwood gained 5 yards on his ﬁ  rst career catch, a play that converted the lone third down of the Gators’ second touchdown drive against the Rockets.
“You guys see it as a 5-yard 
catch,” Pease said. “I see it as a ﬁ  rst down on a third-down conversion that last year we probably don’t get.”
Pease said that by focusing on 
moving the chains rather than try-ing to ﬁ  nd extra yardage, Fulwood 
showed maturity. Fulwood was 
playing to win.
“I know what it means because 
a kid tries to dance around and go 
lateral,” Pease said. “[Fulwood] 
sticks his foot in the ground and nice and gets it. He’s 2 yards short of the sticks, but he gets it. He has enough awareness to stick his foot in the ground and get forward. Terriﬁ  c work. He got the ﬁ  rst down for us.”
The play-by-play mentality has 
diminished the output from the 
passing game since Pease’s arrival 
in Gainesville, but it’s hard to ar-gue with the results. UF is 12-2 with Pease calling the shots on offense.
When Pease went to apologize to 
Demarcus Robinson for what some would call the freshman wideout’s “vanilla” debut, Robinson gave Pease the cherry on top.
“I went up to him in the locker 
room,” Pease said. “I said, ‘You know what? Just be patient. I’m go-ing to do a better job of getting some things designed.’ ‘Coach,’ he goes, ‘I had fun and we won.’”

Jeff Driskel reaches for a snapped ball during Florida’s 24-6 victory against Toledo on Saturday in Ben 
Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Driskel completed 17 of 22 passes for 153 yards and a touchdown in the game.
Henry Russell Sand-
ers said it ﬁ  rst.  
While speak-
ing at a physical education 
workshop at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1950, Sand-ers, who was the football coach of UCLA from 1949 to 
1957, told the group: “Men, 
I’ll be honest. Winning isn’t everything. Men, it’s the only thing.”
Since that ﬁ  rst utterance, those 
words have become a staple in Amer-
ican sports lingo. The phrase has changed slightly, and it is 
often attributed to former Green Bay Packers coach 
Vince Lombardi, but the 
premise remains the same.
“Winning isn’t every-
thing. It’s the only thing.”
Those words have been 
shouted in pre-game hud-
dles, plastered to locker-room walls and printed on T-shirts.
But is it true? It doesn’t seem to be. 
At least not when it comes to the Credit Gators for winning 
while other teams stumble

� MOORE MISHEARD PLAYCALL.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Tyler Moore played his ﬁ  rst game for 
Florida on Saturday, but he made himself 
known to Gators fans for the wrong reason 
early in the second quarter.
Moore, playing right tackle, misheard the 
call on the line and allowed Toledo defen-
sive back Cheatham Norrils to get around 
the edge unimpeded and sack quarterback 
Jeff Driskel.
Driskel fumbled the ball when Norrils 
tackled him, and the Gators turned the ball over one play after forcing a turnover on 
downs.
“It could have been an easy pickup,” Moore said, “and we could have just … went down after the big turnover and got 
another score.
“It made me mad the rest of the day.”Moore might be too hard on himself. 
Aside from the two sacks the Gators sur-rendered, the offensive line provided solid protection in both the rushing and passing games.
No. 12 Florida did not allow a quarter-
back hurry in its season debut, and the line plowed forward, allowing Gators runners to notch 262 rushing yards despite missing guard Jon Halapio (partially torn pectoral 
muscle) and tackle Chaz Green (labrum 
tear).

“He has a lot of arm talent.”

Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus 
While watching Trey Burton Gator 
chomp after each touchdown against Ken-
tucky in 2010, Florida fans thought he was the second coming of Tim Tebow. 
A versatile athlete with an ability to 
throw, Burton scored a school-record six touchdowns against the Wildcats on just 10 touches.
Three years later, consistent production 
has not come as easily for the junior. 
After a freshman season when he led 
UF with 11 rushing touchdowns, Burton has lined up at quarterback, running back, tight end and wide receiver. However, he 
has never had a position to call home prior 
to this season.
Burton starred as a quarterback at Ven-
ice High. 
The experience is now paying divi-
dends for the newly appointed receiver, who caught five balls for 69 yards against 
Toledo. 
“My quarterback coach did a really 
good job of teaching me I had to know ev-
erybody’s position,” Burton said. 
“I basically took that from high school 
and brought it to college. It’s helped me 
out a lot and helped me get on the field a lot faster than I guess other guys.”
His experience all over the depth chart 
has made him a valuable asset for Florida. A matchup nightmare, Burton brings ver-satility to an offense predicated on pound-ing the football. 
Will Burton go out for a pass? Will he 
run the ball?Offensive coordinator Brent Pease 
praised Burton for his conditioning during Saturday’s muggy environment. The se-nior took snaps from the Wildcat position and routinely found soft spots in the back end of Toledo’s defense.Four of his five catches on Saturday 
went for 10 or more yards, including a 16-yard reception on a crossing pattern for quarterback Jeff Driskel’s first completion this season.
“I really trust him to get to the right 
zone,” Driskel said. “The first pass play was an in-cut to Trey. He kind of slowed down and stayed in the first window. I knew he was going to be there. I put it right on him.”
All potent quarterback-receiver combos 
have this seemingly telepathic connection. That trust is three years in the making. 
With Jordan Reed, Florida’s best receiv-
ing option last season, gone, Burton has 
filled the void left by the tight end.
He’s played every skill position on of-
fense and even considered a move to de-
fense. Burton practiced briefly at safety in 
2011.
For the master of disguise, who caused 
the Rockets fits as to where he was, there couldn’t possibly be another role to take 
on? Wrong. How about coach?
As one of the veteran leaders on offense, 
Burton has become another coach on the 
field. He can help line up and direct offen-sive linemen and running backs alike.
“I feel like all older guys should be able 
to coach and help the younger guys out,” 
Burton said. “Because we were there at 
one time.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2013

Alligator Writer @rjschaffer
When Florida swept Duke in 
three straight sets to capture the 
Campus USA Credit Union Invite 
on Sunday, they walked away with 
more than a trophy.
They also found a new star.Florida freshman Alex Holston 
finished the tournament with the best killing percentage on an open-ing weekend for a freshman in Flor-ida history at .436. 
“She’s been unbelievable,” junior 
defensive specialist Holly Pole said.  
“To set a record in her first week-
end as a freshman is just awesome.  She’s such a hard worker, and I love having her on the team.” 
Even though the program has 
seen such stars as Chloe Mann, Kel-ly Murphy and Aury Cruz, Holston now holds the record. 
She could prove to be the spark 
the Gators need to finally make their way back to the Final Four, a feat UF has not accomplished since 
2003.
Last season, Florida averaged 
14.3 kills per game — almost two 
fewer than Oregon’s 16, which led 
the nation at 16. Those two kills could potentially 
be the difference between UF re-
peating last season’s Sweet 16 ap-pearance or advancing deeper in 
the tournament.   
Despite the fact that Holston was 
playing in the first three collegiate 
games of her career, she recorded 20 
kills on the weekend. 
“We hope [her role] will continue 
to grow in her point production,” 
coach Mary Wise said.  “Right now, the way she can produce points is 
with her offense but also with her 
blocking.”
Florida played 10 sets during the 
weekend. Holston was in each. Her 
role may increase over the course of 
the season if she can thrive playing opposite Mann.
“Alex has helped a lot,” sopho-
more outside hitter Gabby Mallette said. 
“She’s really great.  I’m really 
impressed with how she’s been playing as a  freshman, and she’s 
fearless and I think we really need 
that mentality on the court.”  
Although Florida was ranked 
fourth in the nation last season in hitting percentage, the team will 
have to replace seniors Tangerine 
Wiggs and Betsy Smith. If Holston can continue or im-
prove her current pace, she could prove to be as valuable as Mann. 
“She’s just getting better each 
week,” Wise said.  
“She’s a very smooth, steady 
player in that I don’t think she’ll ever be that high flash. It’s not her 
personality, but what she will be is 
a very dependable point scorer for us.” 
The highest-ranked Florida play-
er in kills last season was Ziva Re-
cek, who finished 57th in the nation 
by averaging four kills per set. Hav-ing Holston as another offensive threat would help in cutting down 
the number of attacks Recek takes 
per game. 
In UF’s match against LIU-
Brooklyn, the only match in which 
Florida lost a set, Recek attempted 
40 attacks by herself.  The next high-est on the team was Chloe Mann at 22.  
Relying on Recek too much could 
result in injuries during crucial parts of the season when the Gators will need her.  
Having Holston progress quick-
ly could not only keep Recek injury-
free but also give the Gators another 
threat on the court.Holston smashes UF freshman record

Will Muschamp walks toward the locker room following the first half of Florida’s 
24-6 victory against Toledo on Saturday in Ben Hill Griffin stadium.
Fewer than 84,000 fans were in 
attendance for Saturday’s game
Gators. 
After two downtrodden seasons in 2010 
and 2011, Florida flipped the script last 
year. UF methodically bludgeoned LSU at 
home, thumped the Ol’ Ball Coach’s Game-cocks and dropped only one game during the regular season en route to a Sugar Bowl 
appearance against Louisville. 
The Gators crapped the bed against the 
Cardinals in embarrassing fashion, but any 
UF fan with common sense should have been happy — thrilled even — to see Will 
Muschamp right the ship so drastically in 
just his second season with the program. 
Look at other historically successful pro-
grams to see how truly difficult it is to es-
cape mediocrity once you are stuck in it. 
Miami, Florida’s opponent on Saturday, 
has averaged 5.7 losses per season during 
the past seven years. Southeastern Confer-ence foe Tennessee has lost seven games in 
four of the past five years. The Volunteers 
lost six games in 2009. 
But suddenly, simply winning isn’t 
enough to satisfy the Gator Nation. 
Instead of accepting the wins that piled 
up last season, fans and media alike com-plained about how they were earned.
“Florida’s passing offense was 114th of 
120 teams nationally,” they cried. 
“No receiver caught 50 passes,” they 
crowed.The clamoring has started back up al-
ready this season. No. 12 Florida won its 
season opener against Toledo 24-6, but 
questions arose about the UF offense and its inability to stretch the field.
On Saturday, the Gators accumulated 
262 rushing yards compared to only 153 passing yards. Sure, balance is desirable, but Florida proved last year it is not a re-quirement to win games and have a suc-cessful season.
However, it does seem to be a require-
ment for Florida to be fully embraced. Just look at the attendance numbers if you don’t believe me.
The Swamp used to be considered one 
of the most intimidating locations in college football. Heck, it might have even been the toughest place to play for a solid stretch of time when Steve Spurrier was coach.
But fewer than 84,000 people came out 
for the season opener. The heat probably kept some people from going, but low at-tendance has become a trend in 2012 and 
2013 to the point that Ben Hill Griffin Sta-
dium might not sell out when Tennessee comes to Gainesville on Sept. 21. 
Maybe the offense is vanilla. Perhaps the 
games aren’t as thrilling to watch as when 
Tim Tebow or Danny Wuerffel were run-
ning the show.
But Florida fans should be giddy with 
the recent results. There are far worse alter-
natives than winning in boring fashion.phil , from page 13

Kyle Christy punts the ball during Florida’s 24-6 victory against Toledo on Saturday 
in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Christy averaged 38.2 yards per punt in the game.
Florida falls to No. 12 in AP Poll
senior Kyle Koehne stepped in to fill the void.
“We have really good players coming in and 
out,” Garcia said. “As far as the talent level, it 
doesn’t really taper off.”
Garcia transferred from Maryland, where he 
started 12 games his sophomore year.
For their efforts, Garcia, Moore and red-
shirt senior Jon Harrison earned the Scrap Iron 
Award from the coaching staff for grading out as the best offensive linemen on Saturday.
“There isn’t a guy up front I don’t have any 
confidence in,” offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said.
Koehne played in only 27 games in his first 
four seasons but earned praise for his efforts at 
guard.
“I think he did good,” Pease said. “He’s 
played a lot of positions … you look back at Kyle, and, I mean, he’s kind of one of those guys. He’s such a hard worker, and he’s just steady.
“There was games last year, we’re beat-
ing Tennessee and somebody else where he’s playing tackle. OK, now all of a sudden, he’s guard.”
The Gators suffered another hit to the depth 
chart during the game. Starting left tackle D.J. Humphries left the game in the fourth quarter with an MCL sprain. 
Humphries had given up one sack earlier in 
the game when Toledo defensive end Jayrone 
Elliot beat him around the edge after the snap.
Coach Will Muschamp said Humphries will 
return to practice this week, and he expects 
Humphries to play against Miami.
Polls released: Both the Associated Press 
and Coaches’ Polls were released Tuesday. The Gators moved up one spot in the Coaches’ Poll to No. 9 but moved down two spots in the AP Poll to No. 12.
Florida State jumped Florida in the AP Poll 
and moved to No. 10 after redshirt freshman 
quarterback Jameis Winston led the Seminoles 
to a 41-13 victory over Pittsburgh on Monday.
Georgia dropped six spots in the AP Poll but 
remained ahead of Florida despite losing 38-35 to No. 4 Clemson.
Miami, Florida’s next opponent, remained 
unranked in the AP Poll, but received the most votes of any unranked team. The Hurricanes 
were ranked 24th in the Coaches’ Poll.
Christy struggles: Punter Kyle Christy was 
a finalist for the Ray Guy Award in 2012, but 
he had an inauspicious 2013 debut in Florida’s opener.
Christy kicked for an average of only 38.2 
yards on Saturday — 6.1 yards fewer than his career average and 7.6 yards fewer than last year. 
Christy was named to the preseason All-
Southeastern Conference team before the sea-son began.
Although Christy did not perform to his usu-
al standards, Pease said he did not expect that to last.
“Maybe it’s first-game jitters,” Pease said. 
“(He’s the) best punter in the nation, you know. He’ll be all right.”notebook , from page 13
“It could have been an easy pickup, 
and we could have just … went down

With the loss of ﬁ  ve consis-
tent playmakers to graduation 
following last season, Florida 
entered 2013 without deﬁ  nitive 
answers at key positions.
Now, four games into the 
season, several freshmen have 
become meaningful contributors 
for the No. 10 Gators.
Starting forward Savan-
nah Jordan has made her name known already, scoring ﬁ  ve 
goals during UF’s opening weekend and six total in four games played.
But Jordan is not Florida’s 
only freshman off to a quick start.
Freshmen Pamela Begic and 
Meggie Dougherty Howard made an impact in Sunday’s 
matchup against Florida In-
ternational. Each scored a goal from a corner kick — a situation that has been problematic for the 
Gators in the past.
For Begic, who is a native 
of Semic, Slovenia, it took only 
three games as a starting mid-ﬁ  elder to ﬁ  nd the back of the 
net.
She scored her ﬁ  rst collegiate 
goal off a header in the 53rd min-
ute to increase the Gators’ lead 
to 3-0 against the Panthers. 
“It was a great experience,” 
Begic said. “Before the game I decided 
I wanted to score, especially to make up for some of the mis-
takes I made against the FSU 
game.”
Dougherty Howard found the 
back of the net off another cor-
ner kick just ﬁ  ve minutes later to give UF a four-goal advantage.
She is 
the third UF 
freshman to 
score a goal this season.
“It’s rewarding knowing that 
my hard work is producing re-sults,” Dougherty Howard said. “We’ve just been working really hard as a team, and I feel like 
we’ve gotten a lot better so far 
from the beginning game.”
The freshmen are still adjust-
ing to the college game but have sparked the Gators with their 
play.
“We stepped up ready to play 
at FIU,” Burleigh said. “I would 
have liked to see more goals 
scored in the ﬁ  rst half, but to 
come back out in the second half and really lay it on them early, I think was a good sign for us.” 
Not only has Burleigh given 
starting positions to Jordan and Begic, she has incorporated a majority of the freshman class in the starting lineup.
Freshmen Liz Slattery and 
Brooke Sharp both started in Sunday’s game and came in with 90 minutes and 81 minutes of playing time in the previous 
three games, respectively. 
Both midﬁ  elders played a 
hand in creating scoring oppor-tunities and moving the ball into 
the attacking third during the majority of Florida’s possession 
on Sunday. 
Freshman goalkeeper Nora 
Neset Gjoen is another young 
talent in the Gators’ toolbox.
Gjoen spent a full 90 minutes 
in the net during Florida’s sea-son opener against Florida Gulf Coast and played in the ﬁ  rst half against Florida State on Friday. She has recorded two saves and 
allowed four goals since the sea-
son began. 
Gjoen suffered a concussion 
against the Seminoles, but Bur-leigh is conﬁ  dent she will be 
able to continue splitting time 
with junior goalkeeper Taylor Burke.
Burleigh will continue to hold 
high expectations for the fresh-men unit following its impres-sive start.
“I think we’re going to see 
more and more of that [the 
freshmen talent],” Burleigh said. 
“This is a good freshman class, a little bit underrated. They’re just wanting to step up and do their part, and I think they’re doing a 
terriﬁ  c job at it.”Freshmen carrying load for Gators
