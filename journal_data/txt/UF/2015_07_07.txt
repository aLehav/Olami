As the sport of soccer continues 
to grow in the United States, there’s been an organization at the forefront of that trend: The American Outlaws.
Andrew Diaz founded the city 
of Gainesville’s chapter of the  American Outlaws in 2012 with the goal of building the town’s soccer culture. 
The group hosts watch parties for U.S. soccer games at Gainesville House of Beer, located at 19 W. University Ave., with the intention of creating a lively atmosphere for soccer fans.
And the atmosphere was 
apparent on Sunday, when the United States Women’s National Team beat Japan in the Women’s World Cup Final 5-2 to win the country’s ﬁ  rst World Cup title since 1999.
“We had a great turnout for 
the match. It was a lot of fun,” chapter Vice President Benjamin Swartz said. “The atmosphere overall was electric. Typically with other sports you’d have to go to other stadiums, but with the Gainesville American

Susan Webster has wanted to see the 
historic Newell Hall renovated since her 
sophomore year at UF.
Now a 21-year-old international relations 
and business senior, Webster might start to see hints of the construction starting this November.
Webster, along with other members of the Student Advisory Board, toured the gut-ted Newell Building on Monday morning at 
10 a.m. The tour was led by Blake Murphy, 
21, chair of the Student Advisory Board, and James Marini, the project manager from Ajax Building Corp.
The renovation will cost about $15 mil-
lion and is expected to be completed around January 2017, Webster said. The state leg-islature is providing $10 million in funding. UF is providing the other $5 million.
It will be a library but without the books, she said. Newell will be a 24/7 collaborative space for students — the result of a student 
survey that goes out every other year. There 
will also be a cafe.
Over the past six years, students reported 
that the biggest obstacle for academic suc-cess was study space, or the lack of it, said Murphy, a political science and economics senior.
With the Newell Hall transformation, 
Murphy said, they are hoping to fulﬁ  ll the needs of the students.
This is the third time the renovation of 
Newell Hall has come up, Webster said. In the past, there was a lack of funding.

A whirlwind of controversy is making its 
way across the nation regarding the ﬂ  ying of 
the Confederate ﬂ  ag on state grounds follow-ing the slaying of nine black people by a white supremacist in a Charleston, South Carolina 
church.
Many people across the nation are arguing the ﬂ  ag be taken down to honor the black lives 
that were lost during the horriﬁ  c event. Other 
Americans have been ﬁ  ghting to keep the ﬂ  ag 
to conserve a part of American history.
And now the debate about items symbol-
izing the Confederacy has reached Gainesville.
A speakout against the Confederate statue 
in downtown Gainesville aimed to rally sup-port for the ﬁ  ght to end “white supremacy and racist violence” will be held Thursday at 5:30 p.m. at the southeast corner of Main Street and West University Avenue.
Jesse Arost, one of the event organizers and 
the creator of the group’s Facebook page, “Re-
move the Confederate Statue! End White Su-
premacy and Racist Violence!” said the group wants the commission to visit the topic. 
At the event, activists from local organiza-
tions are going to speak about their experienc-es combating racism, Arost said.
“If we listen to the work of the Confeder-
ate leaders themselves, as they were seceding from the union they were explicitly trying to 
form a new country that was completely white 
supremacists,” Arost said. “There is no way to separate Confederate symbols. There are ways to celebrate southern heritage without involv-ing white supremacy.”
Arost said he is expecting about 90 to 150 
supporters and 10 to 20 people opposing the cause to show up at the rally.
But while some groups aim to remove any-
thing that could be associated with the Confed-eracy, others in Gainesville are unsure why the Confederate ﬂ  ag and related symbols are being brought up following the Charleston shooting.
“The media has a tendency to see a crime 
and blame every person who looks like that for 
that crime,” said Sherrie McKnight, the presi-Downtown Confederate statue causes a stir

Frightening Daytona wreck puts 
NASCAR safety in spotlight
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) 
— Riding bumper-to-bumper at nearly 200 mph, Austin Dillon was smack in the middle of a pack of cars headed to the check-
ered flag when he was suddenly 
sent on the ride of his life.A wreck that began three rows ahead of him sent cars spinning all over the track. When one turned into him, the force of the hit flipped his car up and over two others. Dillon sailed nearly upside down into the Daytona International Speedway catchfence with such a hard hit that it nearly brought his 
3,500-pound car to a sudden stop. 
The fence acted like a slingshot, sending the sheared race car back onto the track, where it landed on its roof and was hit again while the engine block smoldered near-by.  Left behind were a handful of fans who received only minor in-juries from the debris, and a gap-
ing hole in the fence, the mesh 
torn awayDillon sustained a bruised tail-bone and forearm.
Florida man gets 2.5 years for 
having sex on the beach
BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — A 
man convicted of having sex on a Florida beach in front of families was sentenced to two and a half years in prison on Monday.
Jose Caballero, 40, and Elissa 
Alvarez, 21, were convicted in May of two counts of lewd and lascivious behavior in a case that drew international attention for the couple’s brazen act. 
They were videotaped having 
sex on a Manatee County beach last summer in broad daylight. Witnesses testified that a 3-year-old girl saw them.Caballero told jurors that he and Alvarez were not having sex and that witnesses were mistaken. Jurors listened to graphic testi-
mony from witnesses and saw a 
video of Alvarez moving on top of Caballero in a sexual manner in the middle of the day while others watched.“We are grateful that the state has offered 2 1/2 years,” said Ronald Kurpiers, defense attorney for Caballero.Officer hit with Taser while 
taking shoplifting suspect to jail
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — 
A police officer was hit with his own Taser while trying to take a shoplifting suspect to jail in southwest Florida.
St. Petersburg police say Officer 
John Douglas was transporting 37-year-old Jason Lee Benedict to jail after he allegedly stole three bottles of cough syrup and drank them in the grocery store bath-room. As the officer handcuffed Benedict on Friday, authorities say he punched and kicked the 
officer. Police said Benedict bit 
the officer’s hand and reached for his Taser, causing it to discharge in the officer’s left hand.The suspect was initially taken to a hospital, but was in jail by Sunday charged with theft, pos-session of a weapon by a felon, battery on a law enforcement of-
ficer and escape.

Sean Adams, UF history department chair 
and an expert in slavery and history in the 19th century, said the Confederate flag’s his-
torical context of being associated with the 
South has remained the same.
However, Adams said, the political context 
of the flag changed after the Jim Crow laws were abolished in 1965.
The flag should not represent a political 
or social context but rather a historical one, Adams said.Hannah Lewis, 21-year-old UF art senior, 
said that while some view the Confederate flag as a symbol of southern pride, she be-lieves it stands for racism and slavery.
“It’s on the wrong side of history and I am 
not sure why that is anything to be proud of,” Lewis said.
While McKnight said the decision to take 
down the Confederate flag and other items considered symbolic of the Confederacy is ultimately up to local and state governments, she does not want it to continue to be a rift inside the country.
“I would like our nation to see each other 
as people and not color,” McKnight said. “A great racial divide is being created.”LOCAL
THE SUMMER HEATWAVE PRO-
GRAM RUNS UNTIL AUG. 14 AND

PARTICIPATE.

Screeches of laughter and excitement 
from the crowd mixed with the screeches 
of neon-colored tennis shoes as they slid 
across the court at the Martin Luther King Jr. Multipurpose Center. 
A herd of teen players ran up the court. 
Halfway there, they tumbled into a dog pile of jerseys, tugging over the ball.
But rather than pushing and shoving 
each other out of frustration, a tall and slender boy extended a helping hand down 
to a short but quick player from the oppos-
ing team, patted him on the back and raced across the court for a free-throw shot.
With arms crossed and eyebrows fur-
rowed, coach Tandra Simmons nodded her head in approval of this sportsmanship from the sidelines.
Before each game, Simmons spends 
about 20 minutes teaching these kids 
about character, respect and trust. 
These lessons are part of a new life-
skills program implemented by the City of 
Gainesville for its Summer Heatwave Pro-
gram for the youth. 
The program is put together by the ef-forts of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs department of the city as well as 
the Gainesville Police Department.
Simmons said she tries to relate life 
skills to basketball in each lesson.
“Sports is the only thing that really gets 
kids’ attention these days,” Simmons said.
Although this is Simmons’ first year 
volunteering for the city, she has worked for the Boys and Girls Club of Alachua 
County for seven years.
By learning about respect, the kids re-
gard each other as teammates and respect 
their community members as well, Sim-
mons said.
“One day, they’ll give it back to the 
community,” she said.
Running until Aug. 14, the Summer 
Heatwave Program accepts kids ages 11-
18. 
Last summer, the program had about 
200 kids and now has about 400.
“It brings them into a safe environment 
where they can just play basketball and have fun,” said Michelle Weydert, the pro-gram coordinator. 
Other elements of the program include 
a teen lounge and pool parties. City program encourages 
respect, sportsmanship

Over the years, UF researchers 
have created a pesticide that saved 
the Statue of Liberty from termites and a drug that treats people who are losing their vision, among oth-
er scientiﬁ  c revolutions.
Through 2014, the university 
has 87 patents for original and 
tested ideas like these, ranking it 20th among international uni-versities and 15th in the U.S., ac-cording to the National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association.
In Florida, three colleges 
ranked in the top 30 internation-ally for their number of patents. The University of South Florida ranked 13th with 104 patents, and the University of Central Florida ranked 30th with 66 patents.
UF has been effective in trans-
lating ideas into patented intellec-
tual property, said UF Vice Presi-
dent for Research, David Norton.
“Our ofﬁ  ce has worked to turn 
those ideas into impactful technol-ogy for society,” he said.
But getting patents isn’t easy.They take years to obtain and 
can cost thousands of dollars, said Philip Koehler, an entomology 
professor and researcher.
“It’s several years from the in-
ception of the idea — showing it 
can work — to getting approval for it,” he said.
Since January 2012, UF mas-
ter’s student Casey Parker has worked with Koehler to ﬁ  ght against mosquitoes that carry dis-
eases like the chikungunya, which 
can cause severe fever and joint pain, and the deadly dengue virus.
With Koehler, the entomology 
student said she created a con-tainer that attracts mosquitos to its rough edges. The inside can be ﬁ  lled with water, which encour-ages mosquito mothers to lay their 
eggs in the area.
“I worked on the trap before it was a trap,” said Parker, 23.
Before the trap was created 
she said she helped create its pes-
ticides, one of which kills adult mosquitoes while the other kills their young.
The container is going through 
the patent process and is being evaluated by the U.S. Environ-mental Protection Agency, said Parker, whose specialization is in 
medical and veterinary entomol-
ogy.
Although her name won’t be 
on the patent itself, Parker said she has the beneﬁ  t of publishing the data associated with the trap.As for Koehler, who has been 
working for UF for about four de-cades, the number of patents with his name on them is difﬁ  cult to measure.
A single patent isn’t applicable 
to every country, Koehler said. In-
stead, the university has to choose 
which patents to apply for in dif-ferent areas based on how that technology could be used there, and each country’s patent pro-cessing is different.
Parker said she is excited that 
her research can beneﬁ  t others, but it’s taking a long time to get 
through the patent and EPA-ap-
proval process.
“Every time you take a step for-
ward, you take two steps back,” she said.TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2015   ALLIGATOR   5

YOU HAVE A

Between eight shark attacks oc-
curring on the North Carolina coast over the past month and the Discov-ery Channel’s “Shark Week” kicking 
off Sunday, the big creatures of the 
sea have been a talking point this summer. 
But UF shark expert George Bur-
gess said there is one main reason why the shark craze is picking up as of late: It sells.
“The media is focused on shark 
attacks,” Burgess said. “I want to fo-
cus on shark conservation.” 
Burgess, the program director and 
coordinator of museum operations 
for shark research at the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History, said shark attacks have been increasing recently because the human population keeps increasing.
“(For) every person that’s killed 
by a shark each year, 10 million sharks are killed by humans,” Bur-gess said. “You get a really good per-spective on who’s the real attacker.” 
Shark populations, while also 
increasing, are still lower than they were even 25 years ago, Burgess said. “It’s a shame,” Burgess said. 
“They’re still really low.” 
Burgess compared the increase in 
shark attacks to the increase in car accidents over the last 100 years. 
“The rate of car accidents have 
increased in 2015 but that doesn’t mean that cars aren’t less safe than they were in 1915,” Burgess said. “There are just more cars on the 
road, making the probability of an 
accident increase.” 
Even with the recent media ob-
session over sharks, Afsana Khan, an 18-year-old UF political science fresh-man, said she still has no problem going into the ocean.
“(Shark attacks are) just publi-
cized because the attacks happened 
in the same place,” Kahn said.
In Oak Island, North Carolina, 
two shark attacks occurred back-
to-back. Chris Anselmo, ﬁ  re chief of Oak Island Fire Department, was called to both scenes.
Anselmo said both victims were 
about 20 yards away from land and in waist-deep water.
The Oak Island Fire Department 
is sending out a list of precautions to avoid shark attacks. Some of the pre-cautions include to think like a shark, swim in groups and avoid looking like a seal.UF expert: Coverage of 
sharks in media skewed UF 20th internationally in patents

terrified of sharks
Hello Gainesville. We hope you’re having a good day, 
recovering from your Independence Day celebra-tions and enjoying the onset of Discovery Channel’s latest rendition of Shark Week.
The eight shark attacks along the Carolina coast 
have stirred a flurry of articles and news reports on “unprec-edented” amounts of sharking all over the states, and we as a public audience have been confusingly enamored with the topic. We’ve noticed the idea of someone being terrifyingly chomped upon by a shark is considered an enthralling topic of public debate, given how often national headlines have been screaming bloody murder over the news of shark at-tacks.
We’d like to clarify that being terrifyingly chomped upon 
by a shark is not in fact an ideal life option. However, pub-lic attention over a dangerous encounter, which is statisti-cally less likely to happen than getting injured by your toilet, seems a bit skewed.
And we might just know why.The Greek economy is on the verge of collapse, threaten-
ing to drag the rest of the Eurozone, and possibly the world economy in the process, into instability. Neither bankers, politicians or private citizens have managed to develop a worthwhile solution to the matter, even as Greece sits upon a $360 billion debt. At least with a shark attack, it’s pretty clear how you extricate yourself from the situation: by either escaping the terrifying sea leviathan or getting swift medical attention. Probably both would be best.
A lot of proud Americans believe their symbols of regional 
pride are at stake, as a burgeoning movement to take down the Confederate flag gains all kinds of traction from remov-ing monuments to taking Dukes of Hazzard off the airwaves. Meanwhile, a lot of equally proud Americans want to remove an incredibly offensive symbol of slavery and oppression from unwarranted veneration. At least with a shark attack, it’s pretty clear what the problem is when you’ve got a jaw full of yourself in a shark.
Heck, the news is having difficulty trying to settle on a 
name for a Middle Eastern organization we’ve been at odds with for over a decade, commonly called ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State. At least with a shark attack, it’s pretty damn clear what a news organization is going to write for its head-line.
What we’re trying to say is with all the uncontrollably 
scary things trying to take chunks out of our lives, a shark attack is relatively straightforward and easy to handle in a more visceral definition. We clearly can’t quite control how world economics are going to reverberate from a country halfway across the world, settle upon the difference between offense and pride, or even decide how to cleverly name our enemies of the state. 
With so many problems floating around in the news that 
are actively impossible to solve with simple solutions, we are arguably enamored with the idea that terrifying leviathans from the deep will bite the hell out of us. It’s simple, clear-cut and ultimately a break from our day-to-day struggles to not scream at the world for being unbearably convoluted. So there’s that: We enjoy sharks because they freak us out, but in a good way.Column
Slacktivists more important than people think
Despite it’s deceptive name, “slacktiv-ism” can be influential. When some-thing becomes fodder for slacktivists, it can engage people who would oth-
erwise be on the fence about an issue. 
Sharing an article or signing an online pe-
tition can cause people to think about issues 
that do not affect them and provoke necessary dialogue — especially if their Facebook friends 
don’t share their ideology. 
Starting a conversation can be an important part of ac-
tivism.
The most recent example is the rainbow filter that 
Facebook created to celebrate the Supreme Court mar-
riage equality ruling. 
While some might say, “It’s just a filter on a profile 
picture, why does it matter?” it does show how wide-spread acceptance has become, even if it doesn’t ac-complish anything tangible. 
It allows people to show support and celebrate an 
accomplishment. 
Awareness and acceptance are valid goals, especially 
in an America where there are many LGBTQ+ issues that go beyond marriage and warrant a national discus-sion.
The writing off of slacktivism usually comes down 
as distaste for millennials — a perception that the civ-il rights or women’s rights activists of the past would never accomplish what they did through such passivity. 
Ultimately, activists are fighting for recognition of their 
cause, something that can rub off on people through social media. 
Dedicated activists are necessary, but allies of causes 
are always welcome.
Armchair activism allows people who normally 
wouldn’t feel welcome participating in activism a way to contribute.
Despite the fact that slacktivism can be eye opening, 
it can often lead to committing to a cause without think-ing about it’s implications. 
KONY 2012, despite it’s promising release 
and rapid spread through social media, ulti-
mately fizzled out and had little real impact. 
This doesn’t mean that people should be 
discouraged from showing support for causes 
on social media. 
Slacktivism can be ineffective when it los-
es its urgency and becomes less tangible for those sharing on social media, who quickly 
become bored.
However, social media gives new opportunities for 
people to be activists without having to donate money or time. 
People who might not have the time for more com-
mitted or in-depth activism are still able to make a dif-ference by increasing awareness of the issue. 
The term slacktivism paints an image of a person 
unwilling to expand their activism beyond Twitter and Facebook, when in fact that person may not simply know where to start. 
Maybe slacktivists lack depth in their activism, but 
that doesn’t mean their efforts are useless.

BOSTON — Lawyers for 
Boston Marathon bomber 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev ﬁ  led a motion for a new trial Mon-day, less than two weeks 
after he was formally sen-
tenced to death for the 2013 attack.
The motion did not con-tain any details on Tsarnaev’s legal arguments, saying only that a new trial is “required in the interests of justice.”
Tsarnaev, 21, was con-
victed of 30 federal charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. The same jury recommended the death penalty, and  on June 24, a federal judge sentenced him to death.
Tsarnaev’s lawyers call 
the motion a “placeholder” until they can ﬁ  le a more de-tailed motion next month.
The defense also ﬁ  led a 
request for a judgment not-withstanding the verdict.
A spokeswoman for U.S. 
Attorney Carmen Ortiz did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Boston Marathon bomber

CENTER ON SOUTHWEST 34TH

A new organic and natural food store is open-
ing near Southwest Archer Road, joining about 
six grocery stores in the area.
The Earth Fare store, joining Carrabba’s and 
Peach Valley Cafe in the University Towne Cen-
ter, will host a grand opening at 7 a.m. on Aug. 
12 at 3045 SW 34th St. which will include prod-uct demonstrations, live music and giveaways, according to a press release.
Earth Fare offers products free of trans fats, 
artiﬁ  cial dyes, preservatives and sweeteners. The store’s meat and dairy products will also be free of added hormones and antibiotics.
The Gainesville Earth Fare store will have a 
juice and smoothie bar, salad bar, hot foods bar, sandwich counter and other prepared-meal op-tions. It will also have a cafe area with Wi-Fi and dining.   
Nick Banks, the managing director of Front 
Street Commercial Real Estate Group, which handles the leasing for a portion of the cen-ter, said construction for the new store began around October 2014.
“What was always missing from that center 
was a large anchor to draw consumers to (it),” 
he said.
Banks said there will be a second sign added 
to the center to draw more attention to the new 
addition.
“Our (Gainesville’s) demographics play to 
some of those concepts for those looking to break into Florida,” he said. “I think we’re a good entry point.”   
A Youﬁ  t Health Club and Chicken Salad 
Chick restaurant will be joining Earth Fare in the center. Youﬁ  t will open in July and the opening date for Chicken Salad Chick is unknown, said Dina Bartoletta, vice president of retail leasing at Gator Investments.
Bob Parks, father of two, shopped at Trader 
Joe’s when he lived in Boston and now shops at the Gainesville location. Parks said he appreci-ates the growing number of healthy options in grocery stores in Gainesville.Earth Fare coming to Gainesville

HE REPORTEDL Y GAVE THEM 
QUAALUDES.
By The Associated Press
PHILADELPHIA — Bill Cosby admitted in 
2005 that he got quaaludes with the intent of 
giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave the sedative to at least one woman and “other people,” 
according to documents obtained Monday by 
The Associated Press.
That woman and a second woman testi-
ﬁ  ed in the same case that they knowingly took quaaludes from him, according to the unsealed documents.
The AP had gone to court to compel the re-
lease of the documents from the deposition in a sexual abuse lawsuit ﬁ  led by former Temple University employee Andrea Constand — the ﬁ  rst of a cascade of sexual-abuse lawsuits against him. Cosby settled that lawsuit under conﬁ  dential terms in 2006.
Cosby, 77, has been accused by more than 
two dozen women of sexual misconduct, in-cluding allegations by many that he drugged 
and raped them in incidents dating back more 
than four decades. Cosby has never been crim-inally charged, and most of the accusations are barred by statutes of limitations.
Cosby, giving sworn testimony in the law-suit accusing him of sexually assaulting Con-stand at his home in Pennsylvania in 2005, 
said he got seven quaalude prescriptions in 
the 1970s. The lawyer for 
Constand asked if he had kept the sedatives through the 1990s — after they were 
banned — but was frus-trated by objections from Cosby’s lawyer.
“When you got the 
quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going 
to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?” lawyer Dolores M. Troiani asked.“Yes,” Cosby answered on Sept. 29, 2005.“Did you ever give any of these young 
women the quaaludes without their knowl-edge?”
Cosby’s lawyer again objected, leading 
Troiani to petition the federal judge to force Cosby to cooperate.
Cosby later said he gave Constand three 
half-pills of Benadryl, although Troiani in the documents voices doubt that was the drug in-volved. The two other women who testiﬁ  ed 
on Constand’s behalf said they had knowingly 
been given quaaludes.
Three of the women accusing Cosby of 
sexually assaulting them have a defamation lawsuit pending against him in Massachusetts. 
Cosby said he gave drugs to women he wanted to have sex with

July 6, 1972: Andy Smith, chairman of Student 
Government Productions, resigned from his position after it was revealed that he used his SGP long-dis-
tance phone lines for non-SGP purposes. Smith ad-
mitted to using the phone for personal use but said “there was no malice intended.”
July 7, 1987: Tom Walsh, the sponsored research director at UF, asked the UF Parking and Transporta-
tion Committee to approve the purchase of two golf carts so his staff could pick up the research grant 
proposals the ofﬁ  ce processes every year. However, 
University Police Maj. Russell Lambert said driving golf carts on UF streets is illegal, and the carts would need to be police-certiﬁ  ed as motor vehicles before 
they could be driven on campus.July 10, 1997: The Southeastern Conference named 
Danny Wuerffel, UF’s Heisman Trophywinning quarterback, the SEC Male Athlete of the Year for 
the second year in a row. Wuerffel led the Florida 
football team to its ﬁ  rst national championship in the 1996 season as the Gators ended the year with a 12-1 record.

@Graham311, @LFTorresIII
Former Florida men’s basketball 
player Brad Beal, fresh off his third 
season in the NBA with the Wash-
ington Wizards, spoke with alli-
gatorSports about Billy Donovan heading to the NBA, his thoughts on free agency and whether he’s 
spoken to new Gators men’s bas-
ketball coach Mike White.
Hall : Have you had a chance 
to speak to Billy Donovan about him heading to the NBA? Will it be 
weird competing against the Okla-
homa City Thunder and your for-mer coach?
Beal:  It’s deﬁ  nitely going to be 
weird. I talked to him recently and told him I was happy for him, and 
I told him it was going to be weird 
playing against him but it’s going to be fun. I’m looking forward to it. I know he’ll do well — he’s got an 
awesome team with two of the best 
players in the league so I’m sure he’ll do well. I’m looking forward to it.
Hall:  What’s free agency been 
like? What’s it been like seeing the lucrative contracts a lot of players 
have received?Beal:  It’s been crazy just to see 
where guys are going, the amount 
of money they’re getting. This time 
of year is always hectic and crazy, 
but you know I’m looking forward to seeing what moves we make and other teams make and see where 
we can improve.
Torres:  Have you had any in-
teraction with new Florida men’s 
basketball coach Mike White?
Beal:  You know what, he 
reached out to me the day he got on campus. It was pretty cool. We 
were still in the playoffs and he 
reached out and said he’s happy to be a part of the family. He’s happy that I was a Gator, and that any time I wanted to come back down to just let him know. It was an awesome thing he did, and I’m 
looking forward to him coaching. 
I’ve heard nothing but great things about him so hopefully he can get 
our program back to where we 
need to get to.
Hall:  What’s your relationship 
like with John Wall? You guys kin-seem to bring out the best in each 
other.
Beal:  Yeah a little bit, man. 
We compete every day, that’s what 
makes us such successful and good 
players. We accept that challenge. We always say ‘we’re the best 
backcourt’ and we mean it. We’re going to stand behind it and work our tails off to accomplish that. 
Whenever we have the opportuni-
ty to, we compete — we talk trash at each other, we make each other mad but at the end of the day it’s for our own beneﬁ  t and makes us 
better.
Hall:  What are your thoughts 
on the recently proposed NCAA 
provision that would allow under-
classmen the opportunity to head 
back to school after the NBA com-bine but before the draft?
Beal:  I think it would have 
been a lot easier. Honestly, it gives you the determination of whether 
you’re ready or not. Some guys 
may think they’re ready who aren’t really ready, and there are guys who might be ready but aren’t 
ready to take the next step. You’re 
either all in or all out.
Hall:  Would this rule have 
helped some guys who weren’t drafted but felt they would be, 
such as Chris Walker and Michael 
Frazier?
Beal:  It’s kinda a pick-your-poi-
son. You can feel like you’re ready and do all these things, but once 
you’re a part of it and see you’re 
not, it gives you an opportunity to go back to school. If you work out, you never know — there are guys 
who get drafted unexpectedly. What's the deal with Beal? Former Gator discusses NBA

JUST SOME HACK
NASCAR will never be 100 percent safe. 
But after the ﬁ  nal-lap crash that 
sent Austin Dillon’s car into the fence in the wee hours of Monday morning 
at Daytona International Speedway, the sport needs to be commended for the strides it has made to protect the competitors and specta-tors.
If you haven’t seen it, Dillon’s No. 3 Chev-
rolet made contact with Denny Hamlin’s spin-ning No. 11 car while coming to the checkered ﬂ  ag at the Coke Zero 400. 
The collision sent Dillon’s car airborne into 
the catchfence, which separates the fans from the track. 
The car, which was barrel rolling some-
where around 200 MPH, was violently grabbed by the fence, and its momentum was stopped instantly in frightening fashion. 
To make matters worse, after 
the car fell back down to the track and spun to a stop, Dillon was plowed into by the spinning No. 2 car of Brad Keselowski. From my seat in the grandstand right in front of where the sequence took place, the sound of the im-pact was sickening — like a ﬁ  ring squad shooting in unison.
The event was so severe that, fearing for 
Dillon’s life, crew members from multiple teams rushed out to the pile of twisted sheet metal to help the driver, despite the fact that there were multiple cars ﬁ  nishing the race at full-speed just feet away from the accident site.
In a best-case scenario, the incident should have left Dillon lying in a hospital bed.
Instead, the 25-year-old walked 
away from the wreckage moments later with nothing more than bruis-es.
“I’m shocked that Austin Dil-
lon is even alive,” six-time NAS-CAR Sprint Cup Champion Jimmie Johnson said after the race. “I saw 
it in the mirror, and man, I expected the worst when I came back around.”
Dillon’s lack of injury is nothing short of 
miraculous, and it is a testament to how far NASCAR has come in regards to safety.
It was at this same track in 2001 where 
another crash involving the No. 3 Chevrolet occurred, a crash that killed Dale Earnhardt Sr. — one of the most iconic drivers in NAS-CAR history — on the ﬁ  nal lap of the Daytona 500. That fatal crash led to the regulations that saved Dillon’s life Monday morning.
Earnhardt’s death brought about a safety 
revolution in NASCAR, spanning from manda-tory head and neck protection devices, safer walls, a new generation of cars designed spe-ciﬁ  cally for driver safety and countless other improvements.
The journey hasn’t been without pitfalls. But after every shortcoming that has been 
discovered, the sport’s governing body has adapted and corrected ﬂ  aws. 
A 2009 crash at Talladega Superspeedway 
that sent Carl Edwards’ car into the catchfence in similar fashion to Dillon’s wreck resulted in enhanced catchfences, just like the one that kept everything but minor debris from Dillon’s 
Daytona crash highlights recent improvements in NASCAR safety regulations

SEE COLUMN,  PAGE 16American Outlaws … they’re able 
to create that electrifying sense of 
sportsmanship and community in 
the local bars and restaurants.”
Diaz, hailing from South 
Florida where there are multiple 
chapters of the American 
Outlaws, joined the group in 2011 
before chapters were established around the area. 
He wanted to bring that culture 
from South Florida to Gainesville.
“It just kind of made sense 
that we needed a chapter (in Gainesville),” Diaz said. “I believe (in) that culture that we had in South Florida, as far as 
having a place to go to watch all 
the U.S. games.”
Diaz was accepted to the 
University of Florida where he 
majored in sport management, but he noticed that the city of 
Gainesville lacked an opportunity 
to give fans of the sport a place 
where they could gather and watch soccer.
“I think that’s one of my main 
goals in getting a degree is to help 
build soccer culture in the U.S.,” 
Diaz said, “and I thought starting a chapter in Gainesville was one of the first big steps in the right direction.”
Since March 2014, the group 
has used Gainesville House of Beer as its home base. 
Early on, Diaz said he could 
easily count how many people 
were in the chapter, but since 
there are people constantly 
joining, Diaz estimates that there could be more than 60 people who have joined since the chapter’s 
creation.
“We’ve grown every match,” 
Diaz said. “Everybody gets to 
come out and see the culture, 
the atmosphere, going out and 
enjoying the games with us 
and it’s a beautiful thing. It’s something that I’m definitely glad that we brought to Gainesville.”
The chapter officially became 
part of the American Outlaws in April, and Diaz said they couldn’t have done it without the help of the people of Gainesville.
“They’ve really helped us get 
out in the spotlight and get some more exposure and be really supportive,” Diaz said. 
“What fan wouldn’t want to 
go into a bar or a restaurant or 
establishment where everyone 
is pulling for the same team you are, and it just so happens to be America?”  
While the Women’s World 
Cup is over, there isn’t going to be a break for the chapter. 
The U.S. Men’s National Team 
opens play in the CONCACAF Gold Cup against Honduras at 9:30 p.m.
Swartz will be leading the 
chapter at House of Beer as they keep trying to expand the group while Diaz cheers from the stands at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.
“We’re hoping just to get as 
many passionate fans and new fans of the sport, old fans of the 
sport just to come out and support 
the Red, White and Blue,” Swartz 
said.14   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2015

A 2013 Xﬁ  nity Series crash that 
sent Kyle Larson into the catchfence 
led Daytona ofﬁ  cials to move the 
grandstands further back from the 
track for fan safety. 
And while one fan was brieﬂ  y 
hospitalized and a dozen minor in-
juries were reported after Dillon’s wreck Monday, the number would 
be much higher had the grandstands 
been closer to the track.
Even as recently as February, 
Kyle Busch broke his right leg and 
left foot in a Xﬁ  nity Series crash at 
Daytona after hitting a wall with no 
SAFER barrier — a softer wall de-
signed to lessen the force of a car’s impact. 
NASCAR took a lot of criticism 
for the incident, but there is now a 
new wall with SAFER barrier where 
that accident took place.
The process is ongoing.Replacing grass with pavement is 
the next step to help keep cars on 
the ground, and it’s something the 
sport needs to address soon.
But give NASCAR credit. In an era where concussions 
and athlete safety are ever-present 
discussion points, a sport in which 
drivers race at 200 MPH six inches from their competitors is now as safe as any sport in America.16   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JULY 7, 2015
