Tap the app, click the car, pick the driver 
and rate him or her after. Customers can ride in an UberX vehicle in more than 50 major U.S. 
cities, but Gainesville is not among them.
Citizen-driven UberX  is one type of ride 
service offered by the San Francisco-based transportation company Uber, which failed to jump the legislative hurdles necessary to oper-ate in Florida last week.
The company wanted its Uber Black luxury 
line to operate without adhering to minimum fare requirements, accusing the state of charg-ing inﬂ  ated rates that dissuade competition.
“Florida residents and visitors should not 
have to pay arbitrarily inﬂ  ated fares for sedan rides that are up to 28 times the minimum fare of a taxi, even for a ride that is only 10 minutes long,” the company wrote on its website.
Rep. James Grant and Sen. Jeff Brandes at-
tempted to change this by sponsoring House Bill 1389 and Senate Bill 1618, respectively, but both bills died on May 2.

Seventeen UF graduate assistants en-
tered the conference room together, sat 
down and pulled out their proposals. They were determined to drive a hard bargain.
The members of Graduate Assistants 
United, a labor union for teaching and re-search assistants at UF, met with admin-istrators Tuesday in a series of bargaining sessions over issues, including rising fees, health care coverage and disciplinary pro-cedures.
The two administrators, Bill Connel-
lan, head of bargaining for UF Board of Trustees, and Paul Duncan, associate dean of academic affairs for UF graduate school, cited increased health care costs as a reason for the rise in fees, but confusion over past data and the role of an outside accounting ﬁ  rm pushed the issue to next Tuesday’s agenda.
The opposing parties did agree on 
changes to grievance complaint proce-dures and to a revised article of the GAU-UF agreement, which now includes “do-mestic partners” among the list of people whose injury, illness or death could excuse the absence of a graduate assistant.
However, the main issue of UF’s rising 
graduate fees persisted. 
“UF’s fees are unsustainably high,” 
said 29-year-old      GAU chief negotiator and co-president Emily McCann. “Unless the Graduate

Gainesville Police arrested a man carry-
ing 14.37 grams of meth Wednesday after 
he ﬂ  ed a three-car crash scene at The Polos apartment complex, ofﬁ  cials said. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 29-year-old Shawn 
Rutig, of Leesburg, on hit and run charges, drug possession, trafﬁ  cking in methamphet-amine and ﬂ  eeing police, according to an ar-rest report. 
At 5:20 a.m., an ofﬁ  cer saw Rutig driv-
ing his car without any headlights at the intersection of Southwest Archer Road and Southwest 34th Street. 
The ofﬁ  cer turned on his sirens and emer-
gency lights to make a trafﬁ  c stop, but Rutig accelerated.
Rutig then pulled off on Southwest 35th 
Place and drove through the apartment complex, located on 2330 SW 35th Place, ac-cording to the report.
An ofﬁ  cer found Rutig’s car crashed into 
three parked cars near building 13, causing $11,000 in damages, according to the report.
Afterward, the ofﬁ  cer saw Rutig get out 
of the car and ﬂ  ee while barefoot. About two hours after the initial attempted stop, another ofﬁ  cer found Rutig walking in the 2000 block of Williston Road. 
During questioning, Rutig said he 
owned the black Ford Escape but would let his friend borrow his car for methamphet-amine.
A search of the Escape revealed a brown 
bag located behind the passenger seat con-taining 14.37 grams of crystal meth, baggies and needles, according to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers booked him into the Alachua 
County Jail at 8 a.m. As of press time, his bond has not been set. Florida man ﬂ  ees crash, arrested with meth

One pleads guilty in smuggling 
venture that killed four
MIAMI — A Bahamian nation-al who survived what authori-ties said was a failed smug-gling venture that killed four Haitian women faces up to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to illegally re-entering the U.S. after being deported.According to a plea agreement filed Tuesday in Miami federal court, prosecutors plan to seek the dismissal of other charges against George Lewis after his sentencing hearing July 25.He was among 11 people found clinging to the hull of a boat that capsized Oct. 16 off Miami. The four victims died underneath the boat.A change of plea hearing for the boat’s operator Naaman Davis is scheduled Thursday. He faces charges of involun-tary manslaughter, smuggling resulting in death and illegal re-entry.

Family plans complaint after 
officer kicks boy BOYNTON BEACH — The family of a teenage boy plans to file a formal complaint against Boynton Beach po-lice after a video surfaced showing an officer kick-ing the teen’s legs out from under him while his hands appeared to be restrained behind his back.Kevens Jean Baptiste told WTVJ-TV that police were called after he was kicked off a school bus for refus-ing to follow the driver’s order to close a window. The 13-year-old said he had breathing problems after perfume was sprayed inside the bus.“I said, ‘I don’t care. I got asthma,’ and I was coughing, and my face was turning red and stuff. So, I just let down my window,” he said.The officer didn’t say any-thing, Jean Baptiste said.“He, like, sweeped me off the ground. He kicked me,” said Jean Baptiste. “He didn’t say nothing. He just kicked me, and they put me in the back of the car.”The officer has been placed on administrative duty and the department is investi-gating, police spokeswoman Stephanie Slater said.

university is tacitly OK with sending its 
graduate students into debt.”
Fees for graduate assistants increased 
110 percent over the past 10 years, and health care premiums rose as well, said McCann.
Proposed health care premiums 
are about $2,000 to $3,000 higher than last year. GAU asked the university to lower the premium portions consider-ably and to add vision and dental care to the plan.
“You realize that even those of us 
who work for the university have to pay for those?” Connellan said. The director of academic support services walked through the available numbers with GAU until the issue was put aside, again, until the next meeting.
There are more graduate assistants 
at UF than faculty members, said Mc-Cann. She said the line between stu-dent and employee is heavily blurred, because many graduate assistants have to register for credits in order to con-duct research, even if they are not doing coursework.
“It is our position that no one should 
ever pay fees – ever,” said McCann.
Connellan said he didn’t believe any 
similar schools had zero fees.
“My position is negotiating a con-
tract that we can all live with,” he said.
UF administrators plan to return 
with more compelling data for the in-creases, and the members of GAU plan to scrutinize it.

ORLANDO — Two employees tested neg-
ative for a rare virus days after coming into 
contact with a Saudi resident infected with the second confirmed MERS case in the U.S., a spokeswoman for an Orlando hospital said Wednesday.One of the two employees tested after 
showing symptoms of Middle East Respirato-ry Syndrome was hospitalized Monday, said Katie Dagenais of Dr. P. Phillips Hospital.
The other was discharged the same day. 
The hospitalized patient, identified only as a woman, was expected to be released sometime Wednesday, according to Dr. Antonio Crespo, the Infectious Diseases Specialist at Phillips.
Dr. Kevin Sherin, health officer with the 
Florida Department of Health in Orange County, said Wednesday afternoon that all of the remaining health care workers have undergone at least some initial MERS testing, and those results have all been negative. How-ever, he said they will continue to be subjected to more testing going forward.
Sherin added that doctors tracking the case 
in Orlando “believe that this infection is con-tained” and that there was “minimal risk.” MERS is a respiratory illness that begins with a flu-like fever and cough but can lead to short-ness of breath, pneumonia and death.
Despite an increase in cases, the virus’ 
spread in the Middle East and beyond isn’t a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.
The White House also said Tuesday that 
President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS cases in the U.S. and that his team is coordinating with the Centers for Disease Control and officials in Florida.

The company can still petition each town’s city hall for permission
however.
All vehicle-for-hire regulations 
are enforced on a local level, so if 
Uber wants, it can go to each city individually and ask for permission to subvert the standing regulations, as it did in Jacksonville.
In Jacksonville, New York City, 
San Francisco and more than 50 oth-er cities, Uber drivers pick up their customers based on GPS location services from their smartphones, whereas taxis require a phone call and a specific address.
But many taxi drivers and limo 
operators, who make up most of the opposition to new legislation that would enable Uber to expand throughout Florida, find it unfair that Uber, which doesn’t require drivers insurance or a minimum fare, should not have to adhere to the same regulations as they do.
“They only want to cherry-pick 
the good fares and the good cities,” said Roger Chapin, a Mears Trans-portation Group executive and a member of the Florida Taxicab As-sociation Board. “They would like to change the rules to their benefit.”
Because the company has to go to each city hall to ask for permis-sion, Chapin doesn’t think Uber will make its way to Gainesville.
Twenty-year-old UF philoso-
phy junior Tomas Barron wishes it would.
“I used it in New York and D.C.,” 
he said. “It’s really user-friendly, and it’s really easy to set up.”
He said it costs the same or 
slightly more than a regular taxi, and he liked having the option to rate the drivers and request certain drivers.
If Uber did make its way to Ala-
chua County, Barron said he thinks taxicabs would still do OK because mostly young people use Uber.
“Not a lot of older people know 
about it,” he said. “But at the same time, it’s definitely giving taxis big competition.”

The first Student Senate meeting 
of the summer was short and to the 
point. 
Sen. Katie Backstrand was unan-
imously voted into the open mem-ber at-large Senate seat. She has served since Spring 2013, she said, and is currently a College of Agri-cultural and Life Sciences senator.    
In an email sent to the Senate 
listserv, Backstrand cited her time on the rules and ethics committee and the information and commu-nications committee as preparation for her new position.“The Member At Large seat 
is a very significant position, as it requires the use of judgement and experience to select the most quali-fied individuals to serve as Sena-tors and Committee members,” she wrote.
Senate President Pro Tempore 
Joseph Michaels announced the multiple Senate and committee po-sitions available over the summer. Vacant seats include 24 in various committees, eight for permanent replacement Senate seats and 29 during Summer A. 
Michaels asked senators to en-
courage “any qualified candidate” to apply. Qualifications for joining Student Senate include a minimum 2.5 GPA and 12-hour course load for undergraduates, or 3.0 and 9 hours, respectively, for graduate students. Applicants must also be free of financial obligation to the university and not be under con-duct probation. Applications are due Friday at noon and may be found on the Student Government website.
The meeting wrapped up with 
an announcement of an intramural kickball team for the summer sena-tors. 
“This is a serious commitment,” 
said Sen. Dylan Fisher. “We have a dedication to excellence in Senate.”

TAMPA — Two psy-
chiatrists testifying for the 
prosecution Wednesday in the murder trial of a Tampa woman accused of killing her two teenage children told a jury that the former military wife was sane at the time of the shootings, contradicting several defense experts who have contended she was not in control of what she was do-ing.
Julie Schenecker, a 53-year-
old former military wife, is on trial in Hillsborough County Court. She’s been charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Calyx, her 16-year-old daughter and Beau, her 13-year-old son. The teens were shot to death while her now ex-Army officer hus-band was on a 10-day deploy-ment to the Middle East.
Wednesday was the sev-
enth day of testimony with prosecutors presenting three health experts as rebuttal wit-nesses. All said she had a plan to kill the teens. Closing argu-ments were set for Thursday.
Schenecker’s fate hinges 
on whether jurors believe she knew what she was do-ing when the teenagers were shot. If convicted of first-de-gree murder, Julie Schenecker would receive a life sentence, since prosecutors chose not to seek the death penalty. If acquitted by reason of insan-ity, to which she is pleading, she would be committed to a hospital until she is no longer a danger to herself or others.
Two doctors said Sche-
necker had a plan to kill her children and cited her journal writings that detailed the plan as evidence. They also said the fact that she drove to a gun shop, told a clerk she wanted a gun so she could protect herself and then returned fol-lowing a three-day waiting period proves that she intend-ed to kill her children.
Defense attorneys say 
Schenecker suffered from bi-polar disorder with psychotic features and depression and that she was insane at the time of the January 2011 deaths in the family’s Tampa home.
Upon questioning from 
Schenecker’s lawyer, Dr. Donald Taylor did say that her mental condition was on a downward spiral in the months leading up to the crime.
Schenecker told the judge 
Tuesday that she wouldn’t testify on her behalf, and the defense rested.Trial of Tampa mom

Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies arrested 
a man Monday after he walked into his es-
tranged wife’s Alachua house and tried to shoot her boyfriend, deputies said.
Officers arrested 27-year-old Derrick Day 
on charges of attempted homicide, battery, robbery and assault, according to an arrest report. At about 11:30 p.m., Day, from Bell, Florida, came home to visit his 27-year-old es-tranged wife, according to the report.
He pushed his way into the home while 
holding a black semi-automatic handgun, ac-cording to the report. Day began hitting and kicking his estranged wife.
He then pushed her into the kitchen and began saying “Where is he?,” referring to her new 36-year-old boyfriend.
Day then began to shoot toward the back 
of the house, saying, “I’m going to f**king kill him,” according to the report.
Several bullets hit the wall next to where 
the boyfriend was hiding.
Day then got into his gray GMC truck and 
left the area, according to the report. High Springs Police Department later spotted the truck and detained Day.Day had a black, semi-automatic, .45-cali-
ber handgun on the passenger side floorboard of the truck, according to the report.  
Law enforcement later collected shell cas-
ings and bullet fragments from the house.
Officers detained Day near the 25000 block 
of Northwest 182nd Avenue in High Springs. 
Deputies booked Day into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 3 a.m. Monday, where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $475,000 bond. Police arrest fled estranged husband who threatened wife

Massive open online courses are 
growing in popularity with students 
in the U.S. and around the world, but with this growth comes restrictions, namely for international students. 
Some colleges and universities offer free open-course classes, called MOOCs, as course options for en-rolled students. But according to a press release from the U.S. Immigra-tion and Customs Enforcement, stu-dents with a full-time student visa may only count a single three-credit course per semester. However, any-one is free to take a MOOC class and not receive credit.
Andy McCollough, associate 
provost of UF and interim director of UF Online, said although MOOCs like those UF offers on Coursera are free, students, including internation-al students, do not get credit at UF for the classes they complete.
“You can’t get credit at this uni-
versity, but they can help to accus-tom international students to the educational system of the U.S,” Mc-Collough said. 
This rule doesn’t affect UF’s other 
online education model, UF Online, which launched on Jan. 6. McCol-lough said the two programs are dif-ferent. UF Online students earn their degrees entirely online, he said. 
Jo-Anne Carrenard, a 20-year-old UF journalism senior, has taken courses through Coursera.
She said everyone should have 
the option to receive credit for on-line classes because that would en-courage more students to complete them. 
The average rate of completion, 
McCollough said, is less than 10 per-cent.
“I signed up for a whole bunch 
of classes,” Carrenard said, “but I never had time to do them.”

Annoying neighbors: They have loud kids, they don’t pick 
up their dogs’ poop and sometimes they’re cannibalistic ma-niacs. How to deal with them? This week, a 62-year-old Flor-ida woman took a neighbor problem into her own hands and forewent the usual passive-aggressive-notes-in-the-mailbox route for something a little more extreme: duping a contractor into bulldozing her neighbor’s mobile home. We’re tossing our ﬁ  rst maybe-it’s-time-for-anger-management DART of 
the summer at St. Johns County resident Ana Maria Moreta 
Folch, whose mugshot looks not unlike Kathy Bates circa “Misery.”
This week, according to RTT News, the FDA approved a 
robotic prosthetic arm called DEKA inspired by “Star Wars.” The arm was designed by the same man responsible for the Segway, and it works by “sending impulse directly back and forth between the brain.” The prototype is named, appropri-ately, “Luke.” Though DEKA’s designer is, oh, about 30 years late on the uptake, it’s a pretty neat gadget. We’re awarding a this-is-way-cooler-than-Jaime-Lannister’s-metal-hand 
LAUREL to scientists who use pop culture as invention in-
spiration.
Another Florida man went viral this week, but it wasn’t a 
bath-salts-related incident: Florida Democrat Joe Garcia was caught on C-SPAN digging into his ear with one ﬁ  nger and — dry heave — eating his ﬁ  ndings. The video has been viewed more than 1 million times. Instead of owning up to his gross on-screen blunder, Garcia claimed he was scratching his ear before noticing a hangnail, which he “bit off.”
Sure, in the grand scheme of thing, it’s not the grossest or 
weirdest thing a politician has been caught doing, and it’s cer-tainly a far cry from LARPing as a sexually dangerous vam-pire. But for Pete’s sake, you’re a politician on C-SPAN, not a 15-year-old Taco Bell employee in the kitchen. Joe Garcia gets 
the quit-digging-for-gold-on-national-television DART of 
the week.
Despite two Florida persons inviting jokes about the Sun-
shine State this week, a group of ﬁ  shermen in Venice Beach defended our rep by being total badasses and rescuing a 12-foot hammerhead shark, according to Fox News. And as if that wasn’t enough, the men discovered the injured shark was pregnant and proceeded to deliver 20 hammerhead shark pups and release them back into the ocean.
“We seen [sic] the tail, pushing out. They were trying to 
push their heads out, so I’m guessing the mom tried to give birth but she didn’t have the strength to push them out,” one of the ﬁ  shermen told a local TV news station.

After spending years attacking President Barack 
Obama and the Democrats for the Affordable Care Act, Republicans watched in horror as 8 million 
Americans signed up for health insurance coverage through the exchanges set up by the law. The Republicans’ chief line of attack for the election came undone at the news that the number of uninsured Americans plummeted.
Fear not, ladies and gentlemen. The Republicans have a 
new election year strategy, and it’s one that will surely break the back of the feckless president: Benghazi.
The shameless attack in Libya that left four Americans 
dead, including a U.S. ambassador, is once again front-page news as House Republicans scramble to set up a special com-mittee to investigate the White House for its allegedly dirty deeds. Republicans claim they have the ultimate smoking gun: an email that might indicate the White House coached then-U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, over the response to Benghazi.
Screw the emails; the Republicans should start impeach-
ment proceedings immediately.
Why, you ask?It’s the second year of the second term of a Democratic 
president. The last time Democrats had a two-term presi-dent, House Republicans impeached Bill Clinton for lying under oath about sexual acts in the Oval Ofﬁ  ce. Obviously, it’s time to ﬁ  nd a reason to impeach Obama.
When you fail to connect with a majority of American 
voters, the next best option is to simply stage a legal coup as allowed by the Constitution. Republicans spent the entirety of Obama’s ﬁ  rst term attempting to defeat him in 2012. De-spite some — like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R - Ky. — claiming that the Grand Old Party’s top priority was to make Obama a one-term president — they failed mis-erably. Now, they must ﬁ  nd another way to render Obama’s presidency moot, or get rid of him entirely.
Endless hearings on Benghazi will grow boring and tire-
some, and ultimately, the political charade will run its course. However, if they choose to forego the banality of Benghazi hearings and skip straight to impeachment, America will watch.There’s nothing as exhilarat-
ing as putting an American presi-dent on trial for alleged crimes, no matter how ludicrous the charges may be. In fact, an impeachment trial could be the new prime-time program NBC needs to help gar-ner better ratings. Fox might have “American Idol,” but NBC would have “Law & Order: Impeach-
ment,” coming this fall!
The ﬁ  rst half of the season will feature the exciting and 
nail-biting hearings in the House of Representatives, starring such superstars as Rep. Darrell Issa, R- Calif., and Speaker of the House John Boehner, R- Ohio. For good measure, NBC can hire Rush Limbaugh, Alan West and George W. Bush as comic relief.
Ratings will be through the roof!The midseason ﬁ  nale will be a two-part episode that will 
leave viewers breathless: First, the impeachment committee must recommend that Obama be impeached; second, a vote must be taken by the entire House of Representatives.
The midseason ﬁ  nale will conclude with a cliffhanger: 
Does the House vote to send Obama to trial in the Senate?
Of course it will!The second half of the season will be Obama’s trial, and 
it has the potential to be the best season of “Law & Order” in decades. Led by the unﬂ  appable Sen. Ted Cruz, R- Texas, and Sen. Rand Paul, R- Ky., the trial of Obama should make for incredible television.
Will the Senate convict Obama and throw him out of of-
ﬁ  ce? Tune in next season to “Law & Order: Impeachment”!
Does all of this sound insane to you? It should. Your Con-
gress has turned into a circus, run by mostly maniacal ding-bats, constantly searching for ways to derail the president, get a few talking points on Fox News, and in their own de-mented, twisted and disturbing minds, save America.
Chasing conspiracy theories is no way to run a country — 
unless you want to run it into the ground.

Gainesville web design startup Parisleaf 
announced Tuesday it will be pulling up some 
roots at its University Avenue location and replanting them in Gainesville’s Innovation Square over summer. 
Its owners Chad and Alison Paris an-
nounced the move after identifying a need to expand. The two owners and their staff will begin to move to its new location, 107 SW Sev-enth St., within the coming weeks after mak-ing some renovations to the empty building in the square. They plan to open the new location in late July or August. 
Four years ago, Chad and Alison started 
their environmentally friendly printing com-pany called Parisleaf in Gainesville. 
“During our research, we found that the 
printing industry was one of the most devas-tating industries to the environment you could possibly enter into,” said CEO Chad.
A year later, the couple married and ex-
panded from a printing company to a design studio, offering customers a variety of design work such as printing, branding and web de-sign. Now they’ve worked on websites such as Greenpeace and Causseaux, Hewett & Wal-pole in Gainesville. Parisleaf has planted more than 25,000 trees 
across the world.  Parisleaf donates 10 trees for every print job and 100 trees for every website design to local and international organizations that plant trees, said project manager Alison.“We’re hoping to be a beacon in the work-
place on how to do business and how to be environmentally conscious and responsible to have an amazing work culture,” Chad said.
Alison said positive reinforcement is a big 
part of the company’s culture.  
“We all have a commitment to having a 
healthy work environment,” she said. “Every-one stays incredibly positive and upbeat.” 
Parisleaf’s visual storyteller and UF alum-
na Ashley Crane said she has found what she loves doing at the design studio. 
“When you’re surrounded by people that 
just want to be better all the time, it just drives you to be better,” she said.

As many students headed home 
for summer break or locked them-
selves in Library West to study for finals, two Gainesville residents dashed to open a restaurant close to campus.
Located adjacent to Bagels and 
Noodles on West University Av-enue, Maui Grill opened its doors on April 21, dishing out grilled cui-sines to meet the student budget.
Its owners, Ross Kaskeski and 
his wife, Nakita Patalinghug, de-cided making a bid on the former location of the Corner - Latin Con-fusion restaurant was something they couldn’t pass on.
Maui Grill is Kaskeski and Pa-
talinghug’s third restaurant ven-ture in Gainesville and is a sister location to their Maui Teriyaki res-taurant on Tower Road. 
“Our menu is similar to Maui 
Teriyaki but more for students,” Kaskeski said.
Although the restaurant has a 
Polynesian-themed name, Kaskes-ki said the menu has a “huge American flair.” It is sticking to old-fashioned American staples such as grilled chicken, steak and pork and spicing it up with its famous teriyaki sauce, which is a recipe that is kept secret. Only his wife knows the exact ingredients.
The sauce is so popular, Kaskes-
ki said he has seen people come into Maui Teriyaki and run out with the plastic squirt bottles. So he made sure the sauce was more secure at Maui Grill by buying the big, bulky pump squirters. 
Despite opening during the last 
week of class, customer Austin Clark said the restaurant has been a place for business professionals to catch a meal without having to drive to Archer Road from down-town.
Clark said he has been coming 
to Maui Grill at least three times a week since it opened and likes it because it’s “fast but not fast food.”
Patalinghug said the restaurant 
is working on its marketing and currently has specials in the Gator Greenbacks coupon book, with more deals for students to come. Polynesian eatery opens in former Latin Corner restaurant

ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigeria’s govern-
ment is ruling out an exchange of more 
than 270 kidnapped schoolgirls for de-tained Islamic militants, Britain’s top of-ficial for Africa said Wednesday.
President Goodluck Jonathan has 
“made it very clear that there will be no negotiation with Boko Haram that in-volves a swap of abducted schoolgirls for prisoners,” Mark Simmonds, British foreign office minister, told journalists in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.
But Nigeria’s government will talk 
to the militants on reconciliation, Sim-monds said, talking after a meeting with Jonathan.
“The point that also was made very 
clear to me is that the president was keen to continue and facilitate ongoing dia-logue to find a structure and architecture of delivering lasting solution to the con-flict and the cause of conflict in northern Nigeria,” Simmonds said.
He told Nigeria’s Defense Ministry 
that extremists had again attacked the re-mote northeastern town of Chibok, from which the schoolgirls were abducted.
In a video released on Monday, Boko 
Haram’s leader says he will free the girls only if the government releases jailed members of his group. The footage was verified as authentic by Nigerian author-ities, who said 54 of the girls had been identified by those who watched the video late Tuesday.
Nigerian government officials have 
given conflicting responses to Boko Haram’s offer of a swap.
One senior official said on Tuesday 
that “all options” are now open — in-cluding negotiations or a possible mili-tary operation with foreign help — in efforts find the missing girls.British official: Nigeria

TAMPA — Investigators still don’t know 
what drove a Florida man to kill his wife and 
teenage children before setting their rented mansion ablaze and killing himself.
There is no evidence of any misuse of 
funds at the children’s private school, where Darrin Campbell volunteered as treasurer, said Carrollwood Day School spokeswoman Erma Ruffkess on Tuesday.
“As speculation naturally occurs, we have 
no indication there has been any financial im-propriety as it relates to our school,” Ruffkess said. “There are extensive checks and balances and protocols in place to ensure the security of all school bank accounts and accounting/financial records. A complete independent financial audit of the school is conducted by a professional accounting firm on an annual basis.”Investigators are conducting a financial 
audit on Campbell, as well as searching his computer histories and interviewing friends and family members, said Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Debbie Carter.
“At this point, it’s very meticulous,” Cart-
er said. “It could be months before we have anything, or we may never find a motive.”
Campbell had been an executive for sev-
eral high-profile businesses, including a stint at PODS, the mobile storage company. Harry Costello, a lawyer representing Campbell’s last employer, digital services provider Vast-ec, said the company is not auditing his work as chief operating officer.
Authorities have said Campbell shot his 
wife and two teenage children in the head last week, then scattered gasoline and fireworks around their home before setting it on fire and killing himself. He had no criminal history.
The Campbells had been renting their 
6,000-square-foot home from retired tennis star James Blake. The million-dollar home was located in Avila, an exclusive gated com-munity known for its resident sports stars and CEOs.
A private service is being planned for 
Campbell’s children, 18-year-old Colin and 15-year-old Megan, Ruffkess said.No motive yet in Fla. killings“During our research, we found

TALLAHASSEE — One of 
the suspects in a shooting near 
Florida State University has been charged with armed robbery and other felonies, Tallahassee police said.
Authorities said Arthur James, 
40, and Tommy Jackson, 39, were fleeing an armed robbery scene Monday and were shot by of-ficers who were chasing them. Part of the chase wound its way through FSU’s campus.
Jackson later died from his in-
juries at the hospital.
Six officers have been placed 
on administrative leave pend-ing an investigation, though not all fired their weapons. Officers Doug Clark, Steven Britt, Derek Kidd, Ray Garcia, Brian Perry and Matthew Wagner are all un-der review to determine if they followed department policy.
Police have said Jackson shot 
at officers. But police spokesman Scott Beck said Wednesday they are still investigating who shot first and whether James fired at police.
James is being charged with 
armed robbery with a firearm, burglary with person assaulted and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Additional charges are expected.
Police said investigators have 
conducted more than 20 inter-views and have reviewed sur-veillance video and police vehicle video.Armed robbery suspect

Three UF engineering students took home $25,000 
from the Gator Business Plan Competition May 2 for 
their invention of aqUV, a bottle that purifies water using hand-powered ultraviolet light. 
“It’s just like any regular sports bottle, but it has a 
UV light in it,” 27-year-old UF environmental engi-neering graduate student Erica Gonzaga said, one of the creators of aqUV. 
Twist the crank enough times and the light comes 
on, she said. The UV light will then purify the water in the bottle.
“You would need only about two-and-a-half min-
utes for disinfection,” she said.
Gonzaga and her partners, Rob Damitz, a 26-year-
old UF chemical engineering Ph.D. candidate, and Daniel Blood, a 26-year-old UF mechanical engineer-ing doctoral student, hope to create a TOMS-like busi-ness plan in which they donate an aqUV bottle to Haiti for every bottle they sell commercially in the U.S.
The three came up with the idea for a project in an 
entrepreneurship for engineers class. Blood, Gonzaga and Damitz used the tools in Blood’s garage to crank out a rough prototype of the aqUV bottle during the semester.
After receiving positive feedback, the team decid-
ed to enter it in the May 2 competition.
The trio beat 140 applicants and 16 semifinalists 
for the $25,000 grand prize, sponsored by Warrington College of Business Administration’s Center for En-trepreneurship & Innovation. Much of that money will go to intellectual property protection, said Gon-zaga. 
Third-place winners Xiang Mao, a 27-year-old UF 
electrical and computer engineering doctoral student, and Alexander Cohen, a 21-year-old UF information systems and finance senior, took $5,000 for Rewardi-fy, a mobile application that can analyze a user’s past purchases and tell them which credit card to use in order to optimize rewards. 
Cohen said he was impressed with aqUV.“They literally invented a water bottle that’s going 
to change the world,” he said. UF engineering trio win business

BOISE, Idaho — A federal 
judge’s decision to allow same-sex 
marriages in Idaho starting Friday has attorneys for the state scram-bling to appeal and gay rights ad-vocates planning their next steps.
U.S. District Magistrate Judge 
Candy Dale overturned Idaho’s ban on same-sex marriages Tues-day, and on Wednesday she re-fused to put pending marriages on hold while Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden appeal.
Both Otter and Wasden said 
Wednesday they would ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for an emergency stay while they fight the lower court’s ruling.
Matrimonial law expert Sey-
mour J. Reisman said the appellate court is likely to issue the stay, and the U.S. Supreme Court is almost certain to take up the matter.
But with several other states ap-
pealing rulings similar to the one handed down in Idaho, it’s any-one’s guess which state’s case the high court will consider, said Re-isman, a partner in the New York law firm Reisman Peirez Reisman and Capobianco.
“You can’t just have different 
states having different laws all over the place,” he said. 
After the ruling, the Idaho Re-
publican Party issued a statement reaffirming the organization’s stance against same-sex marriage, and contending that the 10th Amendment gives states the pow-er to regulate and define marriage.
“The disintegration of marriage 
will lead to the disintegration of our society,” Idaho GOP Chairman Barry Peterson said in a prepared statement.
Gay couples who choose to get 
Idaho marriage licenses Friday are still open to housing and employ-ment discrimination, noted former state Sen. Nicole LeFavour, Idaho’s first openly gay lawmaker and a leader of the “Add the Words” campaign.
“Add the Words” has become 
the catchphrase for amending Ida-ho’s Human Rights Act to include protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
Reisman said the federal 
judge’s decision to toss out Idaho’s gay marriage ban could make it easier for people to bring a lawsuit over the Idaho Human Rights Act. A plaintiff could claim lawmak-ers’ failure to include protections for gay or transgender people in the act is a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, he said.
Gay rights activists have since 
won multiple lower-court cases, and many legal observers said they expect the Supreme Court eventu-ally will rule that gays can marry in every state. So far, gay marriage is legal in 17 states and the District of Columbia.

By day, Gainesville resident Dianne Farb is 
a practicing attorney, but by night, she trades 
her legal name in for her pen name, Rebecca Heflin, and writes romance novels.
Heflin is the author of three books,  and 
her third and newest book, “Dreams of Per-fection,” was published May 5 on Amazon.com as an e-book for the Kindle. Her two pa-perback books, “The Promise of Change” and “Rescuing Lacey,” can be found at Barnes & Noble. The book is the first in the “Dreams Come True” series.
Heflin said that having a day job in addi-tion to her writing job is one word: stressful.
“It’s pretty jam-packed, but writing is an 
outlet,“ Heflin said. “Having that creative outlet helps me stay sane.” 
Writing was something that Heflin said 
she always wanted to give a try, but she didn’t always have the courage.  
“Writing is a matter of pulling the pieces 
of fabric together with pieces of more fabric,” Heflin said. “I might not know what fabric I’ll use until the end when I try to fill in the scenes.” 
But the support she said she has received 
for her writing in Gainesville has been in-credible.
“I’ve been in Gainesville for 13 years. I love the community, the support. It’s a great place to live,” Heflin said.
Although Heflin loves Gainesville, her 
stories are set in different locations that don’t resemble the city, such as England and Costa Rica.
“Dreams of Perfection” costs $2.99 on Kin-
dle and is not yet available as a paperback.
UF’s anthropology librarian Richard Free-man said, through traditional publishing, there is an entire selection process that has to happen through many editors at the press.
People might have a stigma toward self-
publishing, he said, but the author could also just be a genius who doesn’t want to play that game.
Freeman said he knows a professor who 
self-published on Amazon. The professor had a love for Haitian literature.
“Self-publishing was another great venue 
to disseminate information,” Freeman said.
No matter what form of publishing people 
use, if more people are able to get art into the world to share then it is a good thing, Free-man said.

Swedish singer-songwriter Lyk-
ke Li may have just released one of 
the best albums of 2014 thus far. 
With songs that convey realistic 
struggles, her third studio album “I Never Learn” manages to bal-ance seemingly simple production with complex themes.
While female singers like Katy 
Perry and Lana Del Rey cater to the imaginations of teenage youth, Lykke Li offers a relatable glimpse into the often confusing aspects of relationships and personal happi-ness. Make no mistake, though; the songs featured on “I Never Learn” deliver these themes with catchy tenacity and fluid production.
Lead single, “No Rest For 
The Wicked,” guides the listener through an arrangement of subtle drums, a soft piano tune, and par-adoxically calming, yet lurching, lyrics. Lykke Li sings lines such as “I let my good one down / I let my true love die / I had his heart, but I broke it every time” with such tranquil crooning that it may con-fuse the listener.  
Perhaps the greatest attribute of 
the album is the way it offsets its indie-pop production with often cold lyricism. Songs like “Just Like A Dream” and “Love Me Like I’m Not Made Of Stone” base them-selves off simple, almost-familiar guitar licks and drumming but subvert expectations with haunt-ing thoughts delivered in beauti-fully-controlled singing.
“I Never Learn” strives to make 
the listener question the common tropes of romance and consider more realistic viewpoints. Such contradictory ferocity is welcome in today’s music. Lykke Li’s com-plexity is here to stay.

HELPS SET FASHION AND BUSINESS TRENDS.

Guests at this year’s Metro-
politan Museum of Art Gala, held 
last week, paid homage to Anglo-American couturier Charles James with a host of trendy looks.
Top trends from this year’s 
Met Gala were crop tops, opera gloves, coattails, monochrome dresses and matching couples.
 Celebrities such as Beyoncé, 
Joan Smalls and Selena Gomez showed viewers how to properly work the bold lip trend by us-ing rich shades of red, dark and unexpected colors. Hairstyles ranged from classic pin ups to very sculpted looks.  
The annual fundraiser has 
been held since 1971 and serves as an opening celebration for the museum’s fashion exhibit. This year also marked the rechristen-ing of the Met’s Costume Institute as the Anna Wintour Costume Center, in honor of the editor of American Vogue. 
Unlike last year’s Met Gala, 
there wasn’t a live stream to keep viewers informed during the red carpet arrivals. 
Instead there were live up-
dates on Twitter and Instagram at 6 p.m. using the hashtag #Met-Gala. These made it very easy to retweet or repost favorite overall looks of the night. 
Although the Met Gala was a 
global trending topic on Twitter, some people weren’t aware of the live updates and had to catch all of the celebrity looks in other ways. 
“I keep up with it from year 
to year. People magazine is, like, probably one of my favorites, and I see E! News a lot,” said Anna Mazzuoccolo, a UF nutritional science senior. 
But the Met Ball’s influence 
surpasses fashion trends and so-cial media. It has recently been used as a global public relations platform.
 Amazon.com Inc., has used 
the Met as a way to promote its online retail store, which has signed on hundreds of high-end brands, including Michael Kors and Vivienne Westwood, just by sponsoring the event.    
The Met Gala continues to 
grow as a stage for high-end fash-ion, but the event is proving to be popular among the business side of the industry as well. 
“The Met (Gala) can be a re-
ally good platform for the fash-ion industry in particular to pro-mote designs, designers and a way to connect with each other because it’s all of them there in that one space,” said Josh Ferrari, a 20-year-old UF public relations sophomore. “They are all pro-moting around that one theme.”`
Gainesville’s Samuel P. Harn 
Museum of Art plans to host a fashion exhibit that focuses on contemporary and historical Ghanaian fashion, said Christo-pher Richards, a future curator at the Harn.
“Fashion exhibitions tend to be 
some of the most popular/profit-able forms of museum exhibi-tions,” wrote Richards, who will be guest-curating the exhibit.
According to Richards, the 
Harn has not confirmed a date for the exhibit, but it plans to host it next year.

The Spider-Man franchise did right by its fans when they 
chose Andrew Garﬁ  eld for the series reboot, “The Amaz-ing Spider-Man 2,”  which premiered May 2 in the U.S. and earned about $92 million in its opening weekend. Though our superheroes have been and will be portrayed by many actors, we should appreciate when one performance so completely captures what we love about a familiar character.
Garﬁ  eld appears to understand the character’s duality 
and expertly renders the angsty Peter Parker, who has been the champion of discombobulated youths everywhere for de-cades. He plays the part with a nuanced, methodical physi-cality. It’s rare to ﬁ  nd Garﬁ  eld looking at the person he’s having a serious conversation with, rather than down at the railing he’s climbing over or the stone he’s skipping, accu-rately portraying a young man with secrets and insecurities. He balances these insecurities with Spider-Man’s conﬁ  dence and melds the two into one cohesive, intriguing character.
Garﬁ  eld’s Spider-Man most distinguishes himself from 
Tobey Maguire’s incarnation during his  interaction with others. The dialogue of Maguire’s days had a tendency to-ward forced monologues. Parker’s interactions with his close friend, Harry Osborn, and his love interest, Mary Jane Wat-son, in the Maguire franchise was consistently serious and morose, with few smiles thrown in here and there. 
Garﬁ  eld’s Parker is spontaneous and funny, and for this, 
a tip of the hat is owed to director Marc Webb, whose ex-perience with romance gave the action thriller an intimate, charming feel. Webb directed the 2009 ﬁ  lm, “(500) Days of Summer.” 
However, Webb’s pacing of “The Amazing Spider-Man” 
is anything but slow and sappy. The ﬁ  lm lasts 142 minutes, none of which drags. He directs Garﬁ  eld so that Parker’s re-tains his classical sensitivity while still remaining active. This bit of agency moves the story along and saves us from too many “Peter Parker sits on his bed brooding’ scenes” – like those we got from Maguire’s pouty performance.  
Garﬁ  eld’s Spider-Man is just how we like him: swagger-
ing, mischievous and accident-prone. The hero’s harmless naughtiness is one of his most enduring attributes. Sure, as one of Marvel’s most empathetic, thoughtful characters, Pe-ter Parker struggles with the desire to do right and defend those in need, but as Spider-Man, he relishes his unique posi-tion as the one and only web slinger.Who’s the Spidey-est Spider-Man?

Rising bands such as Bear 
Hands and St. Lucia also drew dedicated crowds. Up-and-coming band Smallpools managed to lure a sizeable crowd on Friday despite the heavy wind and rain. 
Festival organizers main-
tained proper attention to guidelines and safety regula-tions during the initially tor-rential weather.
With the festival slated to 
return in 2015, it will be in-teresting to see how it grows next year. 
If this year is any indica-
tion, Big Guava aims to be (and may very well become) the biggest festival in Flor-ida,  and perhaps even one of the biggest in the nation that could rival favorites like Bonnaroo. THURSDAY, MAY 15, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Festival slated to return in 2015

Matt Martyr / Alligator Staff:
  Vampire Weekend brought their distinctive sound to the lineup at Big Guava.“We try to play the 
upbeat songs, the songs 
that get people hyped.”

In a season where non-conference mid-
week matchups have proved to be potential 
pitfalls for Florida, coach Kevin O’Sullivan needed a strong performance from the top of his lineup to turn the tide Tuesday night against USF.
Within the first two innings, O’Sullivan 
got the answer he was looking for and, as a result, the No. 8 Gators (35-18) finished its home schedule with an 8-2 victory against the visiting Bulls (25-27).
Brett Morales, Florida’s starting pitcher 
Tuesday night, gave up a run in each of the first two innings, which were USF’s only two runs of the game. Down 2-1 heading into the bottom of the second frame, the Gators top three hitters in the lineup responded to spark a five-run inning.
After a throwing error by Bulls starting 
pitcher Lawrence Pardo that allowed Ryan Larson to score from first to tie the game at 2-2, UF loaded the bases with a Buddy Reed single, a Casey Turgeon walk and a Richie Martin hit by pitch.
On a 1-0 count, Harrison Bader lined the 
ball down the left-field line to clear the bases for a three-RBI double to give UF a 5-2 lead.
“I thought Harrison’s (Bader) at bat was 
the probably the biggest with the bases load-ed and kind of helped us relax and settle in,” O’Sullivan said. 
Turgeon, Martin and Bader, who are 
the Gators first three hitters in the top of the lineup, finished the game 6-for-10 at the plate while scoring six of Florida’s eight total runs. Each of the three hitters also recorded

The last time Florida faced Van-
derbilt, the Commodores had won 14 
of its previous 15 matches and had a comfortable lead atop the Southeastern Conference standings.
In that April 11 match, the Gators 
swept their SEC foe without much trouble, winning 4-0. 
But even with a win under its belt, 
No. 8-seed Florida (21-5) won’t be tak-ing No. 9-seed Vanderbilt (21-6) lightly when the two square off in the NCAA Round of 16 today at 4 p.m.
“It was a really tough match,” coach 
Roland Thornqvist said in a release. “The score did not reflect the level of competitiveness in the match.”Florida faces challenge in

The Gators enter the Southeastern Con-
ference Outdoor Championships in Lexing-
ton, Ky., today with the men’s and women’s teams both ranked No. 1 in the nation and each with a chance to become outdoor cham-pions for the first time since 2010 and 2009, respectively.
However, Florida has struggled against 
SEC foe Arkansas, which took the SEC In-door title and finished in first at NCAA Indoors as well while UF settled for third overall at the national meet.
Although the men’s team faltered in last 
year’s SEC outdoors, sophomore sprinter Antwan Wright said maintaining a healthy competition within the team will lead to motiva-tion for a title. 
“Its just friendly com-
petition,” Wright said. “We see them (SEC teams) 
probably 20 times a year. Running against the same faces is good because we 
know how they operate, but then it’s bad because they know how we operate.”
Wright has come across conference op-
ponents numerous times and now poses the opportunity to overcome his opponents in multiple events.

JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
I was 16 years old when I most vividly 
remember being judged for the color of my 
skin. I was a black kid with a crush on a white girl, and I’ll never forget the way I felt when she told me that her mother had made it clear that our relationship wasn’t OK. If the girl’s father were still alive, he absolutely wouldn’t have let it happen, she said. 
Being judged in that way is a pain that 
is difﬁ  cult to put into words. It’s a hurt that many of you who are reading this will never feel, and I’m thankful for that. 
So as I watched Donald Sterling sit in his 
living room and speak to CNN’s Anderson Cooper in a two-part interview, that was the emotional background I carried with me. 
That wrinkled and despondent individual 
rambled, ranted and raved in his ﬁ  rst public interview since making numerous racist re-marks on an audio recording released ﬁ  rst by TMZ and then by Deadspin.com.
If you watched just the beginning and the 
end of his sit down with Cooper, you may ﬁ  nd him sympathetic. But I beg of you, don’t be fooled. 
To start the interview, Sterling broke 
down when speaking about his granddaugh-ter, who was told at her Catholic nursery that she couldn’t have a snack because candy was not offered to racists (Sterling did not clarify who said those words). 
At the end, he cried again about being 
hurt by V. Stiviano — the other voice heard on the released audio — a woman he thought cared for him and whom many assumed he was linked to ro-mantically. 
But if you watched the mid-
dle of the interview, you would have seen an embattled billion-aire on the ropes, deﬂ  ecting blame and trying to drag others down with him.
There was the portion when 
Cooper asks if Sterling had been in an intimate relationship with Stiviano — something she denies. Sterling tap-danced around the question. 
“I don’t think a gentleman should discuss 
any of the personal items that go on with a woman,” he said. 
It’s an interesting, even chivalrous, thing 
to say. Maybe I’d buy it if Sterling didn’t utter the following words in a 2003 sworn deposi-tion:
“Well, I fool around sometimes. I do. 
When a girl seduces me and tells me all of these hot stories and dirty things and tells me how much she wants to suck on me and takes me shoes off and licks my feet and touches me.”
Don’t be duped by this man when he ad-
mits to the “terrible” things he says, calling them “stupid, foolish and uneducated.” He says time and time again that he isn’t a rac-ist and appears ﬂ  abbergasted that anyone would think he has a plantation mentality, even lashing out at Cooper. 
“I think you have more of a plantation 
mentality than I do,” Sterling said. “I think you are more of a racist than I am because I’m not a racist, I’ve never been a racist and I’ll never be a racist. I don’t know what that means so have a (plantation) mentality.”
Well Mr. Sterling, if you had 
a plantation mentality, you’d probably say something along the lines of “I support (the Clip-pers’ players) and give them 
food, and clothes and cars, and houses,” like you did on the audio recording.
If you possessed that ass-backwards way 
of thinking, you would most likely still be-lieve that those you feel you own are still loyal to you when it is quite clear that they aren’t. 
You would probably tell Cooper some-
thing like, “they’re mine and I’m theirs, I would do anything for them and they would to anything for me.” 
You would cling to false hope and your 
own pride in saying that your players, “still love you,” and you would of course say, “they know I’m not a racist.”
See Sterling for who he is: A man in com-
plete and utter denial. Listen to him say that his players’ protest of turning their jerseys in-side out wasn’t a consensus decision but peer pressure from a few within the locker room.
He thinks this is all a media ploy and a 
witch-hunt. He ﬂ  at out refutes the concept of NBA commissioner Adam Silver ousting him as owner of the Clippers. 
Sterling practically said all Magic Johnson was good for was being a 6-foot-9 walking block of AIDS. Sterling then pumped himself up by implying that he is better than the for-mer NBA star because he gives to inner-city youth in Los Angeles and publicizes it in a way that Johnson does not.
Johnson got the platform to voice his opin-
ion Tuesday in the second half of Cooper’s se-ries and the Hall of Fame point guard took the high road as was expected. He was polished and gregarious with his 1,000-watt smile in a way that Sterling’s frumpy demeanor never could be. 
Johnson is the face of the franchise that 
has forever treated Sterling’s club like the little brother across the hall in Staples Center, always living under the shadow of 16 purple-and-gold championship banners.
That is Sterling’s real purpose for bring-
ing someone who, besides his skin color and sole fact that he was in the initial picture with Stiviano, has nothing to do with the entire ﬁ  asco. Sterling saw this as another Laker trying to get the best of him just like when former Clippers vice president Elgin Baylor -- also a Lakers great -- went after him in court over racist allegations in 2009, which Sterling thinks is in no way connected to this situa-tion, I might add. 
Sterling reeks of jealousy, hatred and rac-
ism, and he reminded us of that in a pathetic ploy to clear his name and make his own at-tempt to not be forever seen as a reviled ﬁ  g-ure in the court of public opinion. 
Unfortunately for the soon-to-be-former 
Clippers owner, the buzzer has sounded on 
Don’t be fooled by Donald Sterling’s apology on CNN
Richard Johnson
twitter: @RagjUFthe 100-meter dash and the 
200-meter run — all events in which he has shown he can turn in top ﬁ  nishes for the Gators.
He recorded a ﬁ  rst-place, 
personal-record ﬁ  nish in the 200m during the Tom Jones Memorial Invite on April 19 and took the title along with his teammates in the 100m dash.
But if there’s room for im-
provement, he would like for it to come out of the sprint where the fastest men clock times globally.
“The 100 would have to be 
the event to work on,” Wright said. “I have to work on my reaction time, staying in my drive phase, coming up, and proper form. It’s coming along.”
With a legitimate shot at 
the conference outdoor cham-pionship this season, Florida will take ﬁ  ve of its top ath-letes who have complied a list of honors throughout the outdoor season.
Dedric Dukes (SEC Men’s 
Runner of the Week, USTFC-CCA National Men’s Athlete of the Week), Kyra Jefferson (SEC Co-Women’s Runner of the Week), Kyle Strawn (SEC Co-Men’s Field Athlete of the Week), Ciarra Brewer (SEC Women’s Field Athlete of the Week) and Stipe Zunic (the newly added SEC Men’s Field Athlete of the Week) all enter the championships with top marks throughout the season from April to May represent-ing the Gators. 
Florida owns nine con-
ference titles  — four on the men’s side and ﬁ  ve on the women’s side. In or-der to bring a title back to Gainesville, the Gators can’t rely on all the potential they posses but rather utilize it to ﬁ  nish on top. 
“We’re more conﬁ  -
dent when we are here (Gainesville) because it’s our track,” Wright said. 
“We know how our track 
is and when we go out to a different track it’s just the lit-tle preparation the day before we go practice to see how the track feels. Other than that everything is the same, we do what we do at practice and we do that same thing at the track meet.”

Olivia Janowicz swings at the ball during Florida’s 4-0 win against 
Harvard on Jan. 26 at the Ring Tennis Complex.
Thornqvist conﬁ  dent in altered pairings 
Against the Commodores, 
the Gators won all three singles 
matches in straight sets but were forced into tiebreaks in two of the three doubles matches.
“They are very good in doubles, 
we barely got the doubles point last time on them,” Thornqvist said. “I think just as it was then, the dou-bles point will be very, very critical (today).”After an entire season in which 
the doubles pairings remained fairly consistent, Thornqvist was forced to break up his star duo of Olivia Janowicz and Kourtney Keegan due to Janowicz’s injury.
The move worked in the tour-
nament’s ﬁ  rst match as Brianna Morgan and Janowicz paired up on Court 3 to win the doubles point. 
But in its next match against 
Oklahoma State, Florida dropped the doubles point for just the sev-enth time this season.
“Our ﬁ  rst match against (South 
Carolina State) was very, very good I thought,” Thornqvist said. “We moved a lot and we commu-nicated well. Our (Court) 1 dou-bles against Oklahoma State was very good, but (Courts) 2 and 3 left a little bit to be desired.”
The lack of chemistry between 
Janowicz and Morgan was appar-ent in that match as they lost 8-4. 
If Florida has any hopes of ad-
vancing past Vanderbilt, it must go through one of the SEC’s best dou-bles tandems — No. 20 duo Court-ney Colton and Lauren Mira.
Despite the abrupt change in 
his team’s pairings, Thornqvist is conﬁ  dent in the maturity and ver-satility of his players. 
“We have a very even team so 
I think some of these players you  
could play three different spots re-ally, and they’re very unselﬁ  sh,” he said. “It was really just some of the fundamentals- making ﬁ  rst serves and making returns. If we can ad-dress that [today] then I think we’ll play a lot better.”WTENNIS , from page 20
TRACK , from page 20UF owns nine titles
Florida’s last series of the regular season begins tonight at Tennes see
one walk each.
“That’s Casey (Turgeon) and I’s 
job in the beginning of the game; we 
need to get on base,” Martin said. “Our roles change during the game but obviously we try to get on base and let the big hitters do some dam-age.”
Martin not only led the team with 
his 3-for-3 performance at the plate along with his three runs, but the sophomore shortstop also excelled on the basepaths for the Gators.
Martin recorded his 16th stolen 
base of the season, which leads the squad. Also, two of his three runs scored came on wild pitches in-cluding the eighth and ﬁ  nal run for Florida in the bottom of the eighth inning.
“He ran the bases extremely 
well,” O’Sullivan said. “He was ag-gressive. That was a really, really in-stinctual play at third with two outs there to score the eighth run.”
After dropping three straight 
midweek matchups to Mercer, Flor-ida A&M and Jacksonville, UF came through in the clutch with its 14th comeback victory to improve to 9-4 this season in midweek games.
With the postseason looming, 
O’Sullivan said Tuesday night’s contest was a good challenge for his team to get in the right playoff mindset.
“We talked about that today,” O’Sullivan said. “We need to learn to understand that very shortly here, there’s going to be games being played where if you lose, this season is over. We need to play with a little more urgency.
“I don’t want them to think they 
just need to turn the switch on in the regional or on Thursday night. We needed to start doing this now. We need to play every game like it’s our last.
“We needed to play with some urgency and intensity and not come into this game like we have in some midweek games kind of ﬂ  at. We needed to try and show that.”
The Gators concluded their home 
schedule with a record of 23-11 and head back on the road to face Ten-nessee in the ﬁ  nal series of the regu-lar season that begins at 6 p.m.
“We should go in and try to win 
every game,” Martin said. “If we do that, we put our destiny in our own hands.”

ORLANDO, Fla., — It’s not easy 
to stand in front of a fanbase that just witnessed a 4-8 season and tell 
them everything is going to get bet-ter.
But that’s what head coach Will Muschamp has faced while speak-ing to Gator Clubs across the state of Florida for the last month.
The Central Florida Gator Club 
got it’s chance to ask the fourth-year head coach questions about the upcoming season on Tuesday night. After one of the worst years the Gators have experienced in recent memory, Muschamp said some of the questions are expected to be tough.
“I just think more than anything,  
‘Where are we as a program?’ I think that’s tough — probably fair is a better word,” Muschamp said. “The concern of where things are headed and I certainly think that’s fair after you go through what we went through last fall.”
 A true measuring stick for any 
football problem is how many of the team’s players wind up on NFL rosters following the draft. Four for-mer Gators were taken in this year’s draft including defensive tackle Dominique Easley, who was taken by the New England Patriots in the first round. Seven more signed free agent deals. 
Most notably, cornerbacks 
Loucheiz Purifoy and Marcus Roberson, who were both projected to be drafted in the early rounds of the NFL Draft, were undrafted after seven rounds. Purifoy signed a free agent deal with the Indianapolis Colts. Roberson signed with the St. Louis Rams.  Muschamp addressed how difficult it is for players to de-cide whether or not to forgo their senior seasons and declare for the NFL.
“Well the league minimum is 
like 400-something-thousand now,” Muschamp said. “That’s $400,000 a lot more than what they’ve ever been exposed to. So it’s all relative to what you think. My job is to get them all the information—that’s a family decision.” 
The Gators are moving to a 
spread offensive scheme for 2014 — an offense that has been la-beled as one that doesn’t translate to the NFL. But Muschamp said  it shouldn’t be a concern whether the change offensively will affect draft stocks. 
“Out of the offensive players 
taken in the last two drafts — there’s been 12 offensive players taken in the top ten — ten of them come in spread offenses. So it’s not bother-ing those guys investing in millions and millions of dollars the fact of what offenses they come from.”
He went on to say that the 
spread has crept into the NFL more than people realize, specifically at the quarterback position — one of the most scrutinized jobs in the league.
“In the NFL right now last year 
[for] every snap, 59.6 percent of the snaps were from the shotgun,” Muschamp said. “So you’re talking about six out of every 10 snaps are from the shotgun. Most NFL teams are in upwards of 70 percent of their snaps being from shotgun.”
There are only 108 days until 
Florida welcomes Idaho to begin the 2014 season, which leaves plen-ty of time to sort through the issues the team suffered last year.
“This is a real critical summer 
for us,” Muschamp said. “It always is, its every year but a new offense, our guys need to do a really good job of working each other and con-tinuing to broaden everything what we’re doing offensively. Same on defense — we’ve got some young faces at corner and some young faces backing up on the defensive front situation at safety so this is a critical, critical summer for us.”

After falling in the first round of 
the NCAA tournament last season 
to Denver, Florida has entered this year’s postseason with a reformed attitude and a strong will to win the national title. 
“We know too well, after last 
year losing to Denver in the First Round, we know we can’t over-look anyone,” coach Bryan Shelton  said. “We’re just going to have to continue to prepare and get ready, but we’re excited for this opportu-nity.”
The Gators hosted the first two 
rounds of the tournament over the weekend, and they displayed a strong showing for their home crowd. Florida defeated visiting St. Johns in a 4-0 sweep Saturday. On Sunday, the team took on USF and also walked away with a 4-0 sweep. 
“I was really proud of our guys 
though,” Shelton said. “I felt like we prepared well for today (Satur-day). After exams ended, the guys were focused on tennis and did a good job of making sure they were ready for today.” 
Freshman Elliot Orkin, ranked 
No. 98 in singles, defeated Robert Livi (SJU) 6-4, 6-2 to clinch the win for the Gators in a match that last-ed just more than one hour.
“A year ago, we lost to Denver in the first round, so it feels good to come out here and get a decisive win, 4-0 against a very good St. John’s team,” Shelton said. “Proud of our guys – they came out and played good doubles. We were able to establish some momentum in the singles and then finish it off thanks to Elliott Orkin.”
Senior Florent Diep has also 
shown improvement throughout the postseason run. Diep clinched the match against USF on Sunday. 
“I knew it was my last home 
match, and I was really excited about it,” Diep said. “The first two sets were kind of frustrating for me. I didn’t feel great, but I kept fighting and I was having fun even though I was a little frustrated. … I was feeling great in the third set, and I told Mark (Merklein) I was ready for another one.”
Diep was also named the ITA 
Southeast Senior of the Year on Tuesday.
The Gators will enter the NCAA 
Round of 16 on Friday in Athens, Ga., where they will face the No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes at 7 p.m.
First-round exit last year fuels Florida in NCAA Tournament 
“I knew it was my last 
home match, and I was 
really excited about it.”
