  Sharrif Floyd had one mes-
sage for his teammates before 
Saturday’s game: FNB.
Florida never breaks.“This week, [strength coach 
Jeff Dillman] kept saying it and 
kept saying it, and it got stuck 
in my head,” Floyd said. “I had it written on my tape. FNB. We can bend, but we don’t break.”
At this time last year, the 
Gators were broken.
  Florida had just dropped 
a road game at Auburn for its 
third consecutive loss. A rash 
of injuries had exposed glaring depth issues. The Gators offense 
was suffering from the absence 
of injured starting quarterback John Brantley.
  Florida limped into Jackson-
ville. Georgia sent the Gators 
home with their fourth straight 
loss and a winless October.
  “I like this better,” UF coach 
Will Muschamp said when 
comparing this October to last.
  Said center Jonotthan Har-
rison: “It was all a motivating 
factor. We just talked about, especially last year, the feeling in the locker room we had after the game, how bad it hurt. We 
even had guys getting emo-
tional over it and we used it as pure motivation to come out here and completely dominate this team.”
Now, the Gators, who main-
tained their No. 2 BCS ranking, simply need to defeat the Bull-dogs to clinch the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division.
  But the road back to the top 
has not been easy. Florida has bent plenty this year.
  Second-half rallies have been 
the norm for Muschamp’s club in 2012. The Gators have over-come halftime deﬁ  cits to win 
games three times this season.
  However, Florida did not 
need post-halftime heroics to defeat South Carolina 44-11 on 
Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium. The No. 3 Gators (7-0, 6-0 
SEC) bested the ninth-ranked Gamecocks (6-2, 4-2 SEC) with 
big plays in the ﬁ  rst 30 min-
utes.

With the presidential election looming, stu-
dents have a week and a half to request their 
absentee ballots from their home counties.
Voters who are registered outside of Ala-
chua County have until Oct. 31 to get their 
request to the supervisor of elections in their 
home counties if they want to vote. In Alachua County, voters with an address on ﬁ  le can get a form to request an absentee ballot from www.votealachua.com.
Pam Carpenter, Alachua County supervi-
sor of elections, stressed the importance of get-ting ballots in on time and reminded students to sign the back of the envelope of the absentee 
form when they mail it back. She said about 1 
percent of ballots weren’t signed last election cycle and couldn’t be counted.Early voting starts Oct. 27 and ends Nov. 3.Voters registered in Alachua County can 
also get an absentee ballot in person any day before the election to vote early.
All Alachua County absentee ballots must 
be received at the Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce at 111 SE First Ave. by 7 p.m. on Election Day.
Caitlin Copa, a 19-year-old UF education 
sophomore, said getting an absentee ballot gives her more time to look over the candidates and amendments before she ﬁ  lls out her ballot.
“Politics can be confusing for me, especially 
with so many different topics to vote on,” she said. “It really helps me to have all of my op-tions right there in front of me to look over as I make these important decisions.”Absentee ballot deadline nears

 �THE PINK CHURROS COME 
IN FLAVORS LIKE CHOCOLATE AND DULCE DE LECHE. JENNA LYONS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two-year-old Sophie James 
stared from the pink churro to her 
neon pink pants.
“Ooh, wow,” the toddler said, 
sticking out a tiny finger to poke the pink glaze.
Mi Apa Latin Cafe, located at 114 SW 34th St., is brightening up customers’ meals this month by selling pink churros in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
All churro proceeds will go to 
the National Breast Cancer Foun-dation.
The sale, which began Friday, 
will continue until Oct. 31, said Pe-
ter Ynigo, restaurant owner.
For staff of the family-owned 
café, the churros are bittersweet. 
Ynigo lost his mother to breast can-cer five years ago.
“It just touches home,” he said.Mi Apa’s churros come in fla-
vors like chocolate and dulce de leche. For October, customers can order them made into a breast can-cer ribbon, glazed with pink con-
densed milk.
Jennifer Derby, Sophie’s mom 
and a UF alumna, ended a Satur -
day breakfast with her daughter 
and husband by splitting a pink churro.
She wore a pink ribbon and a 
wristband that read, “Imagine life without breast cancer.”
Derby, a breast cancer survivor, 
was diagnosed in September 2011.
“It sort of turns your world up-
side down,” the 32-year-old said. “I was already a mom. She was just a year old. It was scary.”
After a busy year of treatment, 
Derby said the family has become regulars at Mi Apa again.
When a waitress mentioned the 
churros Saturday morning, Derby 
knew she would order one.
“One of the things I say all the 
time is ‘I wish it could end with 
me,’” Derby said, “I wish I could be the last person.”

Oct. 22, 1965: The Orange Grove behind Century Tower 
and east of the Hub was slated to be renovated into a park-
ing lot with about 150 spaces. The groves were not being used due to a freeze years before. Drivers were already us-ing the area because of the lack of parking available across 
campus. Of the 12,000 cars registered at UF, there were only 
4,800 parking spaces available, resulting in thousands of il-legal parking tickets each month.
Oct. 26, 1983: While meeting to discuss which mural de-
sign would cover the graffiti wall on Southwest 34th Street, a judging panel voted to paint the 1,024-foot wall with a neutral color and cover it with hanging plants. Only two members of the nine-member panel disagreed with the 
decision to cover the graffiti. Florida Blue Key, the group 
sponsoring the project, said no to graffiti. Local artists re-belled against the white wall idea, saying the graffiti is art for the people of Gainesville.
Oct. 21, 1998: The 1997 Blanc du Bois white wine won 
double gold at the Indy International Wine Competition in Indianapolis. The wine was made from a grape developed at UF in 1968. Originally crossbred to ripen early and with-
stand disease, the grape soon caught the attention of wine 
makers for its potential in the early ‘70s. The $7.95 wine was judged against others of the same class from New York, Portugal and Hungary.
Oct. 26, 2004: UF researchers attempted to create “The 
Rescuers” in real life by training rats to be rescue animals in disaster situations. They trained rats to detect certain scents such as bomb material or humans by rewarding rats with 
pleasure sensations through stimulation from electrodes 
implanted in their brains. The research arm of the U.S. De-partment of Defense funded the project.

If you head east on Northeast 
39th Street just beyond the Lamp-
lighter Mobile Home Park, you’ll find a group of folks that live in a state of industry.
A barbed wire fence runs along a 
section of road to keep the 10 goats that roam Alfred Dickerson Sr.’s property from wandering off.
Dickerson and his wife, Jane, live 
in the rural 4,000-square-foot house they built, surrounded by about sev-en other homes and the New Begin-nings Church of God by Faith.Not much has changed there 
since they moved in, but not by choice. The current zoning laws prohibit any new additions because, technically , people shouldn’t live there.
The county designated that land 
as a “heavy industrial zone,” meant for businesses like large storage fa-cilities, concrete plants and smoke-stack-laden mills.
The Alachua County Planning 
Commission unanimously ap-proved a measure Wednesday to rezone that area as residential.
This will allow the homeown-
ers to build on their land without getting charged fees. Up until now, there was a fee of several hundred dollars whenever someone wanted to build onto their property because of the zoning issue, said Harvey Budd, chair of the commission.
Budd said he wasn’t sure how 
the area ended up with the issue.
He said at some point in the 
1970s, the noise from the airport influenced the decision to zone the area unfit for residents. He said air -
planes were louder back then.

Batteries could last longer 
and doctors could detect can-
cer sooner thanks to a new method for growing materi-als from nanorods developed 
by a team of primarily UF re-
searchers.
A breakthrough in the 
field of nanochemistry, the results found by the team of 10 — one member was from Cornell University — could be used toward data process-ing and human medicine.
In the study, which was 
published in Friday’s edi-tion of the journal Science, researchers discovered how to manipulate growth of nanoparticles into “super -
particles.”
Charles Cao, UF associate 
professor of chemistry and 
an author of the study, said 
this has been the main di-rection of his research since joining the faculty in 2003.
While the technology 
for single nanorods is well-established, Cao said, the major discovery was finding how to assemble small par -
ticles into larger particles in a “controlled fashion.”
“Then we can use these 
objects in many applications — one being polarized light, LEDs,” he said.
Efficiency in polarized 
LED television and comput-er screens could increase by 
50 percent.“Eventually we are going 
to save energy,“ Cao said. 
“For example, a computer 
uses two watts of LEDs — 
we can save 1 watt of ener -
gy. Battery life will go from eight hours to 16 hours. You will be really happy.”
Cao said the study also 
has the potential to be used toward medical technology for early cancer detection.
“Because of how strong 
these particles are, they could — we haven’t demon-
strated yet — but could provide di-agnosis in-
f o r m a t i o n of early 
cancer,” he 
said.
First-
year phar -
macy grad student Benjamin Duong, 20, said he looks for -
ward to the medical advanc-es that could be made from this discovery.
“Hopefully this will 
change the future in medi-cine,” said the secretary of the UF Chemistry Club. “Nano-technology is a topic I would love to see grow, since it is a topic with so much potential at such a miniscule scale.”
Cao said the researchers 
are now focusing on other complicated systems con-cerning nanorods, including magnetic properties and oth-er “really fancy work.”Nanotechnology could

President Barack Obama 
and Gov. Mitt Romney will face 
off for the third and final presi-dential debate at 9 p.m. tonight. The event will take place about 300 miles away, but the impact will resonate everywhere — es-pecially on the Internet.
From binders of women to 
Obama’s initial lack of energy, the candidates’ performances have been picked apart post-debate and put online, turning politics into pop culture.
Physics sophomore Cody 
Bronnenberg, 20, doesn’t have a Twitter account, but he fol-lows the memes that often trend after the debates. He said the jokes and parody videos are even better when they’re true.
“It’s pretty funny and in-
teresting to see how each can-didate has people who like to make fun of them,” Bronnen-berg said.
On a more serious note, he 
said he doesn’t think the de-bates are a good way for unde-
cided voters to choose.
“The bad thing about de-
bates is candidates can say 
whatever they want, and there’s no real way to check what they’re saying while the debate is going on,” Bronnen-berg said.
Li Massie, a 19-year-old in-
ternational studies freshman, said she doesn’t watch debates in full. But her politically active friends keep her informed by posting opinions on Facebook.
The debates are a valuable 
opportunity for candidates to show their passion for specific issues, said health science ju-nior Rachael DeViese, 20. She said younger viewers might be more interested in watch-ing videos or scrolling through Twitter feeds to find out what the candidates said.“A lot of young voters aren’t 
going to watch a debate,” she said.
Bronnenberg does but still 
can’t resist watching a paro-died Romney dance to “Gang-nam Style.”

A tent full of farm animals — 
filled with beasts from geese to 
goats — was also a hit with chil-dren, especially a black-and-white, 
pot-bellied pig.
Wagging his curly tail, Sausage 
looked more like a puppy than a pig 
as he sniffed 22-month-old Anna Bates through the wire of his cage.
“She loves animals,” said Anna’s 
mother, Lisa Bates, as the blonde toddler jumped into a nearby pile of sawdust.
The fairground food was also 
popular with Anna and her family, who ate hot dogs, French fries and baskets of corn dogs.
Fairgoers this year can expect 24 
food stands in total, which is more than the previous year, White said. A pineapple-flavored ice cream has been especially popular.
Extra funnel cake isn’t the only 
difference between this year’s fair and last year’s event.Attendance so far has increased 
by 10 to 15 percent, White said.
“A true county fair is a mirror 
image of the community,” he said.
White plans to raise involvement 
in next year’s fair by reaching out to fraternities and sororities at UF for fundraisers.
“The future of this fair is up to 
the community and what it wants to see,” he said.
The fair is open from 5 p.m. to 11 
p.m. on weekdays and from 2 p.m. to midnight on weekends.
Friday’s Midnight Madness is 
aimed at students and stays open until 1 a.m.

my O’Neal, Gainesville residents, walked out of a haunted house.
The couple, who said they’ve

RESEARCH
BEATRICE DUPUY

A UF researcher has reported the dis-
covery of a planetary system that contains 
ﬁ  ve possible planets.
Department of astronomy postdoctoral 
researcher Darin Ragozzine said the NASA Kepler space telescope discovered the plan-
ets.
Currently, researchers can only see the 
shadow of the planets. The shadow allows researchers to understand the orbit and how long it takes the planets to go around the star.
“I’m sure that the outer four are planets, 
and I strongly believe the innermost one 
is a planet, but I’m not quite as sure,” he 
said.
Each of the possible planets is between 
1.2 to 2.5 times the size of Earth.
“This has been on our radar for some 
time. Only recently has the data been long enough to come to some of the conclusions from Darin’s study,” said Eric Ford, an as-sociate professor for the department of as-tronomy.
Ragozzine said it is unique the outer 
four planets’ years are synchronized so all 
four planets turn back to the same conﬁ  gu-
ration about every 191 days. This indicates that in the past, the planets could’ve moved and their orbits could’ve changed slightly.
“Sometimes the plan-
ets’ shadows come early , 
and sometimes they come late. This is due to the planets pushing and 
pulling on each other 
with their own gravity ,” he said.
The system is com-
pact compared to other 
systems. Ragozzine said the outermost planet only gets one-twelfth of the distance that Earth gets from the sun.
“Understanding this system will help 
people studying planet formation,” he said, “why it is that some systems end up look-ing like our solar system, and other systems end up looking like these ultracompact planetary systems.”Researcher ﬁ  nds ﬁ  ve possible

horses makes the 27-year-old smile.
“The riding helps him physically, men-

Conliffe said. “The animal connection is so 
strong.”
About 100 people attended a fundraiser 
for HOPE — HOrses Helping PEople — Sunday afternoon at the organization’s farm in Archer. The organization provides ther-apy for people with special needs through interaction with horses.
Guests played carnival-style games and 
activities such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey and sack races. A petting zoo, bounce house and horse decorated in glitter were among the most popular attractions.
HOPE Executive Director Kristen Coo-
per, 31, said the organization operates on donations, and events like the festival help keep the facilities operating.
“We like being able to offer something for 
kids to come out to the farm and enjoy ,” she said.
Cooper said patients often don’t realize 
they’re getting therapy; they’re just having fun.
“Equine therapy has become very popu-
lar, especially with autistic children,” she said.
Disabilities range from ADHD and au-
tism to being wheelchair-bound.
“The only way they can get out of a 
wheelchair is getting on a horse,” Cooper 
said.
Laura Glicksman, a 20-year-old UF biolo-
gy junior, organized a group of about 20 stu-
dent volunteers from UF’s Phi Sigma Pi coed honorary fraternity to help at the event. 
“This enables them to broaden their hori-
zons,” she said.
Conliffe, a volunteer for HOPE, said her 
son has been receiving therapy from the or-
ganization for the past three years.
“When he ﬁ  rst came, he didn’t talk 
much,” she said. “Now he’s doing great … 
This is a phenomenal program.”Festival supports horse therapy

Bruno Mars keeps 
the awesome going 
Do you remember last year’s season of “Saturday Night 
Live”?
Exactly. It wasn’t very memorable or good.
Don’t get us wrong, we still fully admire the amount of work 
that goes into writing and creating a live sketch comedy show 
each week, but last year was just not full of a lot of superb epi-
sodes.
Maybe the cast was too busy worrying about the departures 
of Kristen Wiig and Andy Samberg, some lovable comedic ac-tors. Or maybe the mid-season, uh, retirement of Paul Brittain also served as a distraction.
However, so far, this year’s season has been spot-on and awe-
some.
For some reason, the jokes have landed better with the audi-
ences and the social commentary is pretty accurate.
Saturday’s episode was no different.When we ﬁ  rst heard that Bruno Mars would be both the host 
and the musical guest, we weren’t sure how well that would go over. He didn’t have any acting or comedy experience before that episode. But he did amazingly well.
The Hufﬁ  ngton Post’s entertainment writer Mike Ryan pos-
tulated that many “SNL” cast members might be thinking, “You know, Bruno Mars could be our new Justin Timberlake.”
Timberlake’s episodes are always crowd-pleasers, and Mars 
lived up to the singer-turned-host name.
“SNL” has a weird dynamic. It simultaneously depends on a 
strong host, but there is a full cast of actors who should be show-cased each week. You can tell if an episode is being carried by the cast, but a bad host shouldn’t bring the show down.
For example, some weird episodes include ones hosted by 
Paris Hilton, Michael Phelps and Lindsay Lohan.
Sometimes there’s nothing the cast can do to save the show, 
and the audience won’t know until the show begins.
In the case of Bruno Mars, our trepidation was totally unnec-
essary.
Perhaps we were all worried that he would ruin the awesome 
streak of this season, but he totally didn’t.
What does this mean for the audience of “SNL”?A good season means more people will pay attention; that’s 
especially important in an election year.
Because people like watching news in an entertaining format, 
popular TV shows will probably become more political. Why else do you think President Obama showed up at “The Daily Show” last week?
“SNL” has done spoofs of each of the presidential debates so 
far, and they have nailed them entirely. The cast captured the feeling and hilarity of both candidates.
It’s important to be as informed as possible, should you 
choose to vote in this election. The wording on your ballot may not be very clear, so feel free to do all kinds of research before 
making a decision.
If that means you have to watch “SNL” to get a quippy ver-
sion of events, then so be it, because it’s actually worth it this 
year. It won’t lead you down the wrong road.
On memory and art; Or, West Egg revisited
I’ve often been told by purveyors of horrible clichés that 
memory is a powerful tool for good.
I don’t argue memory’s power, but I’d compare it 
more to a demon-possessed chainsaw that occasionally turns on by itself while it’s sitting in the garage and maims a few 
of your unsuspecting body parts (like that poor kid in “Out, 
Out—”) than something like a really nice cordless drill (seri-ously, those things do work).
Memory is what bears us back ceaselessly into the past 
like boats beating against the current (as someone who is a much better writer than me once put it) but also what makes us crazy, what shatters our glass minds with regret, what digs into the lush soil of our sleepings at night when dreams are terror incarnate. Memory is nothing if not the half-thought 
harbinger of things to come, a warning in the past who re-
minds us that even our “ten days from now” will someday be our “many years ago.”
I fear my memory . I fear its tendrils of smoke in the night 
when it resembles an angel of darkness standing in my door-way. I fear its apparition in dreams that encircle all of my thoughts with oceanic swells and grow up through them like a world tree, its maddening rooster cackle that sings of time’s inevitable catastrophe.
For memory is the stiff-necked refusal to believe; the stink-
ing heartrent failure to forgive; the slaughtered-lamblike fol-lowing to altars with glowing white candleﬁ  ngers that set the heart ablaze in days when the clouds seemed always ready to split and bellow their disastrous disapproval; the doe eyes of unfought-for love that a storm of anger and argumentative egoism washed away across life’s canyon ﬂ  oor while help-less our lightning burrowed watching in the clouds.
I think I got lost in an epiphanic break of riverlike emotion 
and forgot that I was going to make a point.
Actually, that sort of is my point.Memory is the key and our mind’s dam is the gate. 
Proust’s madeleine is an oft-cited example of this universal truth.
Sometimes we cannot help but be reminded. Sometimes the dam is too weak to stop the break, and the 
wood and stones ﬂ  oat with the tide of the mind down roar-ing rapids of reminiscence until the implications of the scene become clear, and we’re left to ponder on these things and keep them in our hearts. This (along with art and the 
search for life’s meaning, which 
are really the same thing) is what separates us from animals.
As far as I can gather from my 
admittedly faulty method of ob-
serving the squirrels on the Plaza of the Americas (although I’m sure some very thoughtful person is going to love go-ing out of their way to correct me!), animals do not meditate upon their memories: They simply learn the appropriate re-
ﬂ  ex to speciﬁ  c stimuli and move on with their lives.
Humans are an inherently tragic race because our memo-
ries can eat at us so, drive our sanity over cliffs and rocky 
ridges, make us do things not because they make sense but because.
And perhaps this is why we make art.Art is as much a search for truth and answers as religion 
ever was. 
The memories that sometimes make us destroy ourselves 
sometimes release themselves from the prison of our minds in rushes of arpeggiated colors, runs of birdlike notes, slith-ering brushstrokes of rhyme and meter: because truth is beauty, and beauty is truth, and to know that is all we need on Earth.
We must create. We must create so that humanity’s mem-
ory can taste the same bitter cup that we taste in every day of the thunderlike growling of silent longing. And perhaps someday our creation will suffer the exaltation that we so in-
nately crave for ourselves.
Anyway , what I was going to say is that there’s something 
my father told me in my younger and more vulnerable years 
that I used to turn over in my mind a lot, but I don’t remem-ber what it is anymore.

The Alligator’s editorial opinion by Moises Reyes on 
Oct. 19 shows that he’s ready to work on a cable news pro-
paganda show upon graduating from journalism school.
His piece about Mitt Romney’s nonpandering to 
women’s pay disparity compared to men’s was factually 
wrong.
The real cause of women’s pay disparity is indeed their 
lack of seniority due to their voluntary lifestyle choices 
and changing employment status often due to having families.
Seniority is a labor union clause in collective bargain-
ing contracts foremost and less often seen in nonunion workplaces. In fact, progressive policies (unions) are caus-ing the glass ceiling barrier, not some Republican Party or private-sector conspiracy.
Any private employer would gladly pay a woman 
more than a man if she’s producing more, and they do.
The unemployment crisis has hit women harder since 
President Obama took office, as unionized seniority means “last hired, first fired” in public sector and other unionized places. Many factories and government em-ployers have hit women hard.
Women fare much better odds of being paid for their 
current performance if they avoid seniority situations.
In other words, they should work in the private sec-
tor and with nonunionized co-workers who respect their work now, not for being around so many years before.
J.D. Knee, Gainesville residentLetter to the Editor“Hey, kiddo.”
This is Sally, greeting me as I arrive 
at my “job” at Friends of the Library, 
where, indeed, I am a kiddo compared to 
many of the volunteers.  Until I started work-ing at Friends of the Library, no one had called me “kiddo” since my great-aunts did 
a long time ago.  
I was trained; this is an organization that 
takes itself seriously.  
The entry-level position is working three 
hours a week as a “sorter.”  My time slot was Mondays from 9 a.m. to noon.  In January 
2004, when I started, the Monday morning group was a fun bunch — mostly old-timers who had worked together for years, maybe 
decades.
Elizabeth, who is my mother’s age, was 
the go-to person if you didn’t know where 
to put a book. Sorters go through the volu-minous donations and organize the books ac-
cording to category.  
I found some of the categories strange but 
quaint — holdovers from an earlier time. Like 
“Agriculture,” which included the anatomy 
of insects as well as landscape gardening.
The “table coordinator” — that is to say 
the person who organizes and prices books 
in a certain category — for Agriculture was Sandy, and she couldn’t be less “country.”
Once as a joke, the building manager, Jim, 
who was in the process of upgrading the signs that hang above the tables to identify them, changed “Agriculture” to “Sex, Drugs, 
and Rock ‘n’ Roll” and waited to see Sandy’s 
reaction.  
Sandy and her friend Pat then played 
a practical joke on Jim. Apparently he had made fun of Valentine’s Day, so they made 
him a giant valentine, complete with Her -
shey’s Kisses and pop-ups — and all manner 
of Valentine’s books, of course.
One time I walked into the kitchen/office 
— and the only air-conditioned and heated part of the “Bookhouse” — and heard Pat say, about someone who had lost weight, “But boy, let me tell you, honey, she found it again.”  The office has been the site of much sto-
rytelling and laughter: jokes, family fiascos, tales of yore.
I was a sorter for less than a year because 
the “book sale coordinators,” Ann and Billie, who manhandle this massive volunteer oper -
ation to mount the spring and fall book sales, needed someone to take over the videotape table. This was when VHS was still widely 
used and DVD donations were few.  
It was a wonderful table to work because 
every movie you have ever heard of, those 
you haven’t, movies you hadn’t thought 
about in years, movies you always wanted 
to see and movies you have fond memories of came through, and you could look at the covers and read the backs for a little chunk of happiness.
It was a popular table with the volunteers, 
and people were always coming back to chat and peruse the products.  
Bill, a white-haired, retired, engineering 
professor, was visiting one day. I had been listening to a CD in my car and asked him if he knew what “entropy” meant.  
It turned out I had asked the right person.  
Bill had written a paper on this very subject, 
and the next week he brought it in for me to 
read.
Bill was friends with Katy Dunn (no one 
ever called her just “Katy” that I’m aware of), 
who passed away a few years ago. She was 
something of a legend at Friends of the Li-brary and had done many things, but when I was working there, she mended damaged books.  
Katy lived on a farm outside Hawthorne, 
and she and her husband had spent many summers in England. She told Bill she had been to every pub in Cornwall described in 
Bill Bryson’s book.  
Bill said he enjoyed approaching Katy with 
a line of poetry and hearing her respond with 
the whole poem. So: “Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” was greeted with 
“Ozymandias!” and ten more lines.  
When Bill looked astounded, she said soft-
ly, “Bill, you don’t know Shelley?”A year and a half 
after I became “the 
videotape lady,” I 
had 15,000 videos to 
deal with for several 
sales in a row.  It was a bit overwhelming: My table would be stacked up like I was building 
a videotape mansion.  
I still liked it, though, and got repeat cus-
tomers at the sales and learned what kinds 
of things different people liked. I have since turned the table over to a newer, fresher vol-
unteer.  
As Billie once said, “There is no amount of 
money I would take for this job.”
But there are, of course, other things.  I liked it when Joann, who is not a South-
erner like me but from rural Wisconsin, 
agreed with me one day in the kitchen that she didn’t care for mountains because “you might fall off.” I had always thought I was 
crazy to think that and mostly kept it to my-
self.  
It’s one reason I like living in Florida.  Elizabeth once said, in a conversation 
about our constant space problem, “You can always fit in one more book.”  
And you can, if you’re clever.  We are all constant recyclers.  For most people, this was a habit long 
before it became fashionable. Boxes that contained donations are broken down and used to soak up the water that flows down the ramp into the Bookhouse during a heavy 
rain.  
If I have sweets in the house that are 
tempting my constantly dieting husband, I 
take them to the Bookhouse.  
People have no problem with a partially 
eaten peach cobbler, red velvet cake or the like. 
Sue loves dogs. She calls her two “the 
kids.” She asks me about my new former 
stray (“How’s the girl?”) and shows me pic-
tures of her dogs over the ages. She’ll take in dogs nobody else wants.  
There are several husband-and-wife 
teams. They may work together or, in the case of Bob, become a regular volunteer after Joann, his wife, passed away.  
I became friendly with one of the husband-
and-wife teams, Johnny and Mary, after I re-alized they reminded me of my relatives.  
One winter, Johnny brought in carton af-
ter carton of grapefruits because he and Mary 
and their kids and grandkids and neighbors 
couldn’t eat them all. The problem had start-ed when he threatened a nonproducing tree with a chainsaw the summer before.   
And then there are the treasures.  
Everybody has a story: the Civil War-era 
newspaper found behind the frame of a do-
nated painting; the money found inside books (the record is $870); the prized videotape, tied 
down in a copyright dispute, unavailable on 
DVD and hard to find; or the out-of-print children’s book.  
Sometimes the things that are given to us 
by mistake can be traced back to the owner 
and returned, but not always.
My own favorite moment was when Jim 
pulled a letter out of a book and discovered it 
was written by Lindbergh.  
That would be THE Lindbergh.  Jim was awestruck, and everyone work-
ing nearby ran over to see what it was and to hold it. It was typed on that vellum-type paper you would use if you were doing the 
sets for an old movie, and there at the bottom 
was the signature.  
Very cool.Twice every year, one of my favorite mo-
ments is just before the sale begins at 9 a.m. on Saturday.  
The shelves are artfully arranged, the 
aisles are clear, the smell of old books fills the air, volunteers pace with anticipation, the 
line outside is buzzing. A half hour later, it 
is complete pandemonium but exciting nev-ertheless.
The fall sale starts on Oct. 27 and lasts five 
days, ending this year on Halloween. It will be one of the most rewarding things you do this semester, I guarantee it.

Near the glowing lights at Ben Hill Grif-
fin Stadium, far from the tailgaters playing 
cornhole by Norman Hall and blues music 
by Library West, Gators fans cheered just 
before 7 a.m. Saturday.
ESPN’s “College GameDay” started 
building its set on the north lawn of the sta-
dium Thursday for Saturday’s live broad-
cast across the United States. Lee Corso, wearing an Albert the Alligator head, and other analysts made their picks against a backdrop of hundreds of Gators fans.
“GameDay,” known for attracting cre-
ative sign-makers and attention-grabbers, hadn’t been to Gainesville since 2009, when the Gators hosted Florida State Uni-
versity for Tim Tebow’s last home game.
By Friday afternoon, students were al-
ready hanging around the set.
Michael Glazener, a 26-year-old busi-
ness management senior, brought his 4-foot-3-inch, two-piece cutout of coach 
Will Muschamp’s head.
Glazener said he brought it to Knoxville 
when the Gators played the University of 
Tennessee, one of the Gators’ two away 
“GameDay” appearances this season.
“A giant Muschamp head kind of 
stands out over everyone,” Glazener said. “The more sober Tennessee fans thought it was funny, but the drunker ones told me they would break it.”
Hundreds of students and fans packed 
the grassy corral featured behind the “GameDay” set for its live broadcast from 9 a.m. to noon.
Joshua Pauls, 19-year-old applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore, 
brought a sign depicting Muschamp riding 
a flying pterodactyl. He arrived at about 8 p.m. Friday.
“It’s getting nutty out here real fast,” 
Pauls said. “They don’t understand the 
magnitude of how much we love this 
team.”
On the other side of the barricades stood 
52-year-old Sandy Dunbar from Tampa. 
She wanted to be seen in every shot, so 
she bought three Gators-themed balloons with long strings. 
She said the fans around her thought 
the idea was innovative.
“These guys in front of me holding 
signs were like, ‘Oh, my arms are tired. I wish I had balloons,’” Dunbar said.
When the analysts arrived on the set 
for the broadcast, “GameDay” host Chris 
Fowler told the crowd the show had “been 
to more Florida games for ‘GameDay’ than 
any other team.” 
The Gators have appeared 35 times, 
beating out Ohio State University with 30 
and Oklahoma University at 28, according to ESPN’s website.
Kirk Herbstreit said at a press confer -
ence that coming to Gainesville for the show is always memorable. 
He said the passion college football fans 
have for the sport is “unprecedented.”
“Any time you come into the SEC, 
there’s always a buzz in the air,” he said. “To come back to Gainesville — it’s a great place because they love college football.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2012

Forty women and 11 men will compete tonight in 
UF’s Homecoming Pageant.
The event is scheduled for 7 p.m. in the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts. Tickets are $12 at the door.
Judges include Carol Muschamp, UF spokesman 
Steve Orlando and Associate Vice President for Student 
Affairs Norb Dunkel. This year, the contestants will compete in a new Gator-gameday casual-wear round.
For contestant Allison Banko, a 21-year-old UF jour -
nalism senior, this is the first time since high school graduation that she will be walking on a stage.
“I decided to apply because it’s something that is 
completely out of my comfort zone,” she said. “It’s se-nior year, and I realized this is the last time I’ll be able to do something like this.”
Contestant Billy Vranish, 21-year-old UF political 
science and economics senior, said his love for being a Florida Gator and his increased involvement in Home-coming events motivated him to enter the pageant.
“The competition is stiff this year,” Vranish said.He said he is excited to have his family come out and 
support him tonight, along with his friends and Delta Tau Delta fraternity brothers.
The top three men and top three women will be an-
nounced at the pageant. The Homecoming Queen and King will be named at Gator Growl on Nov. 9.Homecoming

Puppies pranced around Dogwood 
Park & Daycare on Sunday , decked out 
in costumes that would make even the most austere cat-lover croon.
Dogwood Park & Daycare held its 
third annual Halloween event, featur -
ing a dog costume contest, an agility run, adoptions, food, prizes and raffles. About 50 people attended.
A group of five students from UF’s 
business college teamed up with park staff to help raise money for Helping Hands Pet Rescue, a nonprofit organi-
zation in Gainesville dedicated to rescu-
ing shelter animals.
Kelly Chirico, a 21-year-old business 
junior at UF, said the event was part of a group project for her Sales Manage-ment class. She said all of the event’s proceeds will go to Helping Hands.
“We’ve handed out fliers, talked it 
up and pitched the idea to businesses to try to get them to -donate money,” Chir -
ico said. “Our goal is to raise $1,400.”
As dogs and humans filtered into 
the 15-acre park, they were met with a multitude of smells. 
Hot dogs and cheeseburgers cooked 
on a grill, and homemade chili sim-mered in slow cookers.
About 15 dogs and their owners 
gathered to compete in five categories: cutest, scariest, best owner and dog pair, most creative, and superhero.
Zeus, a Yorkshire Terrier, was 
dressed as a gnome. He won second place in the cutest category.Despite the “ruff” competition from 
puppies wearing banana split and angel costumes, the overall winner was Nyla, an Australian Shepherd dressed in a 
shark costume. 
Her owner won a six-month mem-
bership to Dogwood Park.
Prizes for puppies and their owners 
included a homemade pound cake, dog 
treats, a dog blanket and memberships to the park.
Staff from Butler Plaza Animal Hos-
pital also attended the event to offer 
treats, discounts, free dental exams and 
safety tips for dogs.
“We enjoy meeting people and edu-
cating them about good dental hygiene for their dogs,” said veterinarian Denise Seufert. “We’re offering them a chance to take care of their pets.”Costumed puppies compete in annual

As the Florida Gators brought the pain to the South Car -
olina Gamecocks during Saturday’s football game, police 
laid down the law with ejections and arrests.
For the second game in a row, the number of people 
ejected from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium crept into the triple digits.
University Police kicked out 106 people, 38 of whom 
were UF students, according to a UPD news release.
Officers made the majority of ejections for alcohol pos-session, public intoxication, standing on seats or smoking. 
They issued 30 civil citations.
Police removed one person from the stadium for fight-
ing and another for theft. Officers also arrested three UF 
students and nine other attendees.
The arrests were mainly for disorderly conduct, tres-
passing or alcohol possession. Police issued five notices to appear in court for alcohol possession.
The total number of ejections and arrests from Satur -
day’s game increased slightly following the UF-Louisiana State University matchup on Oct. 6. During that game, po-lice ejected 108 people and arrested an additional six.

It was just a gravel driveway in 
front of a Central Florida middle-
class house. 
But Clarence Anthony Jr. said 
he’ll never forget it.
Standing near the white lime-
stone surface, his guide told how 
a crew of migrant workers was im-
prisoned there in a parked cargo truck at night.
“You never know what could be 
happening at something that just 
looks ordinary,” said Anthony, 24.
The first-year UF counselor edu-
cation doctoral student piled into a 
minivan with about half a dozen oth-
er UF students to visit Immokalee, 
an agricultural community about five hours south of Gainesville. 
While the town could be per -
ceived as ordinary at first glance, it 
is notable for its tomato production 
and cases of human rights violations 
in recent years. The group visited 
last weekend.
Students spent two days explor -
ing the town and significant sites of 
day-to-day life for migrant workers. 
The trip was in partnership with the 
Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a worker-led human rights group 
based in the town.
Stephanie Gomez, a 25-year-old 
first-year Latin American studies 
graduate student at UF, said the group visited an agricultural field 
where workers harvest crops.
Even though the field was empty 
and covered with protective plastic 
for the off-season months, Gomez 
said viewing the environment first-
hand painted a vivid picture of what life as a laborer is like.
“There’s no shelter,” she said. 
“You’re really out in the elements.”
The group also visited a paved 
lot where workers congregate at 5 a.m. most days to wait for school-bus transportation to the fields.
Daniella Lopez, a 21-year-old 
UF English and philosophy senior, said she watched a bus return to its launching pad in the late afternoon.
She said the workers streamed 
out from the back hatch of the bus, many wearing sweat-soaked T-shirts and wide-brimmed cloth hats 
for protection from the sun.
“They looked so tired,” she said.
Anthony said the homes most 
of the workers return to are trailers 
clustered within walking distance 
of the parking lot.
Lopez described most of the 
trailers as “weather-stricken,” lack-ing paint and sagging from age and 
exposure. 
Around the houses, residents 
used trees and wires to dry laundry 
in the humidity.“It doesn’t look like you’re in the 
U.S.,” Lopez said. “It’s like a differ -
ent country almost.”
Gomez, however, said Immoka-
lee’s housing epicenter reminded her of her family’s home in Chi-
cago’s Pilsen neighborhood, char -
acterized by a vibrant community, 
blaring Latino music and mom-and-pop Hispanic grocery stores.
Gomez said she saw men grouped 
on front porches enjoying Saturday afternoon beers, a mom pushing a child in a stroller toward the gro-cery store, and youths meandering 
and listening to music.
“You know people don’t have a 
lot of money, but they still have a lot 
of life,” she said.
Despite that, Gomez said, a sense 
of normalcy filled the trailer park.
“They’re not sitting around there 
going ‘Woe is me,’” she said. “It’s very normal because they live it.”
During the trip, the students also 
got to experience how it feels to har -
vest tomatoes.
Lopez said a community center 
worker directed her to grasp a blue 32-pound bucket filled with bags of rice to simulate the weight of toma-toes. 
She hoisted the bucket onto her 
shoulder and was required to run 100 feet to dump the contents out.
Lopez said she struggled with the 
feat, but she wasn’t the only one.
“Even the big people — strong 
guys — had trouble with it,” she said.
Considering the difficulty in-
volved, Lopez said she estimated $5 per bucket would be a reasonable wage to pay workers.
When she learned workers are 
actually paid 35 cents per bucket and try to fill at least 100 buckets per day, “my mouth dropped,” she said.
Gomez said the weekend experi-
ence was thought-provoking over -
all.
“A lot of us were really quiet be-
cause we were processing what was 
going on,” Gomez said.
She said gaining firsthand insight 
into the daily lives of agricultural 
workers in Immokalee was valu-able because consumers often don’t 
understand the human element that

TOLBERT HALL. 
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Contributing Writer
Residents of Tolbert Hall evacuated their 
building Friday night after a small fire broke out 
in the second floor kitchen.
Michelle Ryan, 18, was cooking chicken cut-
lets with vegetable oil in her floor’s kitchen at 
8:30 p.m. when the psychology freshman real-
ized the oil was smoking, not bubbling.
Ryan said she grabbed her cellphone to call 
her mother for help, but her mother didn’t an-swer.
“By the time she called back, it was up in 
flames,” she said.
The flames grew to about 2 feet, which 
burned the wall between the stove and the hood, 
she said.When she saw the flames, she thought to her -
self, “Holy crap, what did I do wrong?”
Ryan ran down the hall to find the floor’s res-
ident assistant, but she wasn’t in her room.
She went to her room to find her roommates.
One of her roommates, Paige Gomes, a 
19-year-old biology freshman, saw the fear in Ryan’s face and called 911.
Her other roommates knocked on doors to 
get residents to evacuate.
“It was just a simple thing,” Gomes said. “I 
saw the fire, and the first thing was to call 911.”
After the fire was put out, the alarm sound-
ed.
Gainesville Fire Rescue let residents back into 
the building at about 9:30 p.m.Dorm evacuated after small fire
“By the time she called back, it was 
up in flames.”

Fans of the University of 
South Carolina and UF were 
on opposing sides Saturday, except at the Greater Gator and Gamecock Tailgater.
For the first time in 
Gainesville, students and families were offered an al-cohol-free tailgate co-spon-sored by UF and the rival school on the Student Health Care Center’s front lawn on gameday.
About 1,000 people went 
to the tailgate to enjoy games 
and free food.
“When it comes to game-
day, some people drink more 
than they normally would,” said Maureen Miller, director of GatorWell. “We provided an option where anyone could come and still have the opportunity to have a fun tailgate experience and not have to worry about alcohol being involved.”
The tailgate was created 
by the Alcohol and Drug 
Education Policy Commit-
tee and sponsored by repre-sentatives from USC as well as several UF organizations including GatorWell Health Promotion Services, Univer -
sity Police and the Depart-ment of Recreational Sports.
It marked the end of Con-
flict Resolution Week, a week of guest speakers and events aimed at educating students on proactive and peaceful ways to resolve or avoid con-flict, according to the Dean of Students Office’s website.
Sara Schwartz, a 19-year-
old architecture sophomore, 
chomped on two slices of 
pizza as she lounged in the shade with friends.
“It’s nice seeing these 
schools come together for a bigger cause,” Schwartz said. “Dehydration while drinking alcohol at the games is always 
a major issue, so what they 
are doing is a good thing.”
Schwartz said the alcohol-
free tailgate was a lot of fun.
“They’ve really pulled in 
a big crowd while keeping Gators and Gamecock fans hydrated,” she said.
Miller said the tailgate 
marked the first largely coor -
dinated and marketed event of its kind at UF.
The UF sponsors agreed 
they would like to do it again 
in the future.
“It was our first time do-
ing it, and we were not sure 
what to expect,” she said. “We had a great turnout and consider it a success.”

Loucheiz Purifoy (right) forces South Carolina’s Bruce Ellington to fumble during a 
kick return in the ﬁ  rst quarter of Florida’s 44-11 win on Saturday in The Swamp.
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 After struggling to get on the board early in 
games this season, Florida’s offense took a 7-0 
lead less than a minute into Saturday’s contest, and it had a defensive back to thank for it.
  Loucheiz Purifoy blitzed from the left cor-
nerback spot on the game’s ﬁ  rst play from scrimmage. The sophomore sacked South Carolina quarterback Connor Shaw on the Gamecocks’ 5-yard line and forced a fumble 
that was recovered on the 2 by Buck linebacker 
Lerentee McCray.
  The play set the tone for the Gators in their 
44-11 rout of the Gamecocks in The Swamp.
  “I felt like he saw me,” Purifoy said of Shaw. 
“He gave me the little jab like all quarterbacks do, but I was like ‘Oh this is a kill shot. I’m go-
ing to kill him.’ When he stepped up and left the ball out I was like, ‘You messed up.’ And I slapped the ball out of his hand.”
  Three plays later, the Gators scored on a 
3-yard touchdown pass from Jeff Driskel to Jordan Reed.
  Coach Will Muschamp said the decision to 
bring pressure early was one the coaches made long before kickoff.
  “I told the players to play aggressive, be-
cause we’re going to call it that way,” Mus-champ said. “Dan (Quinn) and I were talking in the hotel this morning and I said, ‘Let’s bring the pressure. Let’s go.’
  The hit on the quarterback was the ﬁ  rst 
tackle for a loss of Purifoy’s career. He hopes there are more to come.
  “I love blitzing,” Purifoy said. “I got a 
mindset of a linebacker. … I just love hitting people. … I’m real physical.”
  On the ensuing kickoff, Purifoy forced an-
other fumble when he tackled returner Bruce Ellington at the South Carolina 21-yard line. Ellington fell on the ball at the 18.
  Purifoy’s tackle was his fourth on special 
teams this season. In 2011, Purifoy led the team with 22 special teams tackles. Although he has seen signiﬁ  cantly more time on defense as a sophomore, Purifoy said he still values mak-ing plays on kick and punt coverage.
  “Special teams win games,” Purifoy said. 
“One block punt away can win a game for you. One muffed punt can lose a game for you. So that’s my goal. If they muff a punt or they don’t call a fair catch and I get a chance to tee off on them, hey, give it to them. Maybe they’ll Sophomore cornerback sparks

  He’s always taken a back seat to Jeff 
Driskel on campus.
  For Gators punter Kyle Christy , it isn’t 
easy being the roommate of third-ranked 
Florida’s starting quarterback.
  “Nobody actually comes up and 
talks to me,” Christy said. “I’m actually roommates with Jeff. A lot of times I’ll be hanging out with him and he’ll get rec-ognized.”
  Christy doesn’t seem to mind, but his 
performance on Saturday could get the sophomore from Brownsburg, In., some attention.
  He set a school record by kicking sev-
en punts of 50 yards or more on Saturday against South Carolina. 
  Christy has a shot to become the sec-
ond Florida player to receive the Ray Guy Award, which is given to the nation’s top punter. Chas Henry won the award in 2010.
  Christy entered Saturday’s game ﬁ  fth nationally in yards per punt. He has pinned opponents inside their 20-yard line 12 times.
  “What a game-changer,” Gators coach 
Will Muschamp said. “What a ﬁ  eld posi-
tion change to have a guy like that — a 
weapon like that. Also, our coverage units are outstanding. Loucheiz (Puri-foy) and all those guys do an outstanding 
job.”
  The coverage 
team, led by Puri-foy and Trey Bur-
ton, forced South Carolina fumbles on a 
punt and two kickoffs.
  Gamecocks receiver Ace Sanders,  
who entered the game ranked second in 
the Southeastern Conference in punt re-turn average, managed two returns for just 1 yard.
  After Driskel found tight end Jordan 
Reed for a 3-yard touchdown on Florida’s ﬁ  rst drive, Purifoy forced receiver Bruce 
Ellington to fumble the ensuing kickoff.

  The time to be critical is over. Let’s 
put to bed all of the questions about whether Florida’s success is sustain-
able. It just doesn’t matter.
  Is throwing for less than 100 yards in 
three consecutive games a winning formula? 
Of course not. Should fans be encouraged af-ter UF had 29 yards of total offense and 64 yards of penalties in the ﬁ  rst half? No. 
Did Florida really assert its dominance 
on Saturday? In the words of South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier: “The one thing you can hope is that your guys give it their best shot and not just lay the ball down and basically say: ‘Here Florida, we don’t want to win. You guys take this fumble and this fumble and this fumble.’ So it was sad.”
  The thing is, none of that matters.
  Florida is one win away from the South-
eastern Conference Championship Game, 
two wins away from being in the BCS title game and three wins away from the national championship. (Don’t count Missouri, Loui-siana-Lafayette and Jacksonville State as real opponents. Florida State is no pushover, but if Florida loses that game and win the SEC Championship, they’ll play for the crystal 
football anyway.)
  Forget about a lack of discipline result-ing in three personal 
fouls, or an inept passing attack, or the fact that Florida has been outgained 
in the ﬁ  rst quarter of 
every game this sea-son. Doesn’t matter.
  Any problems the 
Gators have at this point in the year aren’t likely to be ﬁ  xed. The team is what it is, and coach Will Muschamp’s approach reﬂ  ects the shift in mentality.
  On Sept. 8 in College Station, Texas, Mus-
champ went on a tirade while speaking to a group of 30 reporters crammed into a room about the size of the average dorm. Sure, he was happy UF had just come from behind to beat Texas A&M 20-17, but there was something he had to get off of his chest. The media had given him a lashing after Florida apparently struggled to beat Bowling Green, and he was tired of hearing about it. He had 
called a run-based attack with an eye on the 
big picture, even if that led to an ugly victory in Week 1.

Florida finished with four forced fumbles 
and a blocked field goal.
Wide receiver Andre Debose added a 19-
yard punt return, and the kickoff unit aver -
aged 37 yards per return.
“(Special teams coordinator) D.J. Durkin 
does a fantastic job,” Muschamp said. “We 
put a lot of emphasis on it. We meet a lot. We 
spend in every practice a minimum of 25 min-
utes on special teams.”
The turnovers wouldn’t have been possible 
without the hang time on Christy’s punts. 
Durkin challenged Christy in practice to 
work on improving the time his punts stay in the air.
The coach has worked with Christy since he 
arrived at Florida in January of 2011. Although 
Christy unseated senior David Lerner in just 
the sixth game last season, he had trouble ad-justing to the pace of college football.
Now after what he called the best game of his life, Christy is starting to garner more at-tention.
“Everybody on the team knows who I am,” Christy said. “Maybe not last year, but this year I think they do.”Driskel tosses four scores: Driskel passed for less than 100 yards for the third straight game 
on Saturday.
Still, the sophomore threw a career-high 
four touchdowns.
Muschamp didn’t seem to mind the 11-
for-16, 93-yard stat line Driskel posted against 
South Carolina.
“(We) won the game,” Muschamp said 
when asked about Driskel’s performance. “That’s goal No. 1. That’s what I look at. Jeff, 
like every other player sitting in that locker 
room and every coach starting with me, is go-ing to watch the film and say , ‘What can I do better?’ That’s what’s been good about this football team. We’re very hard self-evalua-tors.”
The Gators won the field-position battle, so 
there wasn’t much Driskel needed to do.
Six Florida drives started in South Carolina 
territory. Four of those were inside the Game-cocks’ 30-yard line.
All four passing touchdowns measured 
than 15 yards.
“I’d rather have 1 yard in front of me rather 
than 75,” Driskel said. “We just did a good job of scoring touchdowns.”

org.having one-game seasons, then we’ll start doing everything we can do,” Muschamp said. “We’ll put every-thing we can into one game, so we 
can win one game and all be really, 
really happy at the end. But I like to look at it as a 12-week season, and we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do to improve our football team.”
But, when asked on Saturday about 
a possible trip to the SEC Champion-ship Game, Muschamp had a differ -
ent tune to sing.
Before the reporter could even fin-
ish asking his question: “We play in 
Jacksonville next week. We’ve got 
one game, a one-game season.”Of course Muschamp isn’t done 
trying to make improvements. He ad-mitted that the Gators “don’t have a lot of margin for error,” adding that he wants Florida’s offense to evolve into something more balanced.
“This is who we are at this point,” 
Muschamp said. “Will it be who we 
are in three weeks or next season? No, 
I don’t think so.”
As nice as that is to say, nothing is 
going to change, because nothing has to change.
In a one-game season, or even a 
three-game season, anything can hap-pen. As silly as it sounds, being the best team isn’t that important this late 
in the year. The only thing that’s im-
portant for Florida is scratching and clawing and trying to win every game in a vacuum.
Changing what to this point has 
been a winning formula won’t make that any easier. Besides, maybe UF al-ready is one of the top two teams in college football. Of course, if it isn’t, 
that’s not important. What matters is 
which team wins the most games, and right now Florida has unquestionably the best resume in the NCAA.
How great the team really is 
doesn’t matter. Only the results mat-ter. And, with three more wins, the Gators can be national champions.

lose the ball.”
Purifoy also made an appearance on offense. In the 
first six games of the season, Purifoy occasionally lined 
up at wide receiver, but he received his first target of 
the season on the first play of the Gators’ final drive of 
the third quarter.
On a play that began at the Gamecocks’ 44-yard line, 
Driskel threw to Purifoy as he ran a fly route down the left sideline and 
inside South Carolina’s 10-yard line. The pass was perfectly placed in Pu-rifoy’s hands but was knocked out by cornerback Victor Hampton.
“I really did think I was going to 
get it,” Purifoy said. “It’ll be another opportunity.”
Muschamp said Purifoy will continue to get looks 
on offense and has the skills to make plays with the ball in his hands. But Purifoy’s ability to track down ballcarriers is even more valuable. 
“We put a lot of pressure on our corners,” Mus-
champ said. “He’s played solid football for us all year. He, by far, is our most physical corner.”

� ERIKA TYMRAK’S GOAL SPARKED 
UF’S OFFENSE IN A 4-0 VICTORY AGAINST VANDERBILT ON SUNDAY. 
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
The Gators needed 140 minutes to score 
this weekend. But when senior midfielder 
Erika Tymrak sent a shot from the left side into the far post netting, the floodgates opened.
“I saw the far post open, so I hit it and it 
just kind of knuckled in,” she said.
Tymrak’s goal was the only score Flor -ida (13-4-1, 10-2 Southeastern Conference) needed in its 4-0 victory against Vanderbilt (5-9-5, 2-6-4 SEC) on Sunday afternoon.
After a scoreless outing against Alabama 
on Friday, the Gators started slowly against the Commodores. Florida struggled to push the attack forward, and when it did, Van-derbilt’s defense often broke up passes and stopped the attacks short.
“We were just a little bit impatient in 
the first half,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “At halftime, we talked about just keeping possession in Vanderbilt’s defensive half. And once we did that, I think some things 
opened up for us.”
When UF returned for the second half, 
the goals came early and often. Tymrak opened the scoring in the 51st minute, and 
senior Jo Dragotta followed with a second goal a minute-and-a-half later.
Dragotta’s shot came from more than 30 
yards out but still managed to sneak into the top right corner of the net.
“I just looked up and 
saw the keeper was a little off her line,” Drag-otta said. “I just hit it as hard as I could.”
“It was like déjà vu,” Tymrak said, ref-
erencing Dragotta’s 20-yard score against Mississippi State on Oct. 14. “I told her that 
she has that upper 90 spot with her name 
on it.” 
The goal was Dragotta’s sixth this sea-son, which gave her the team lead. But not 
for long.
Six minutes after Dragotta scored, red-
shirt senior McKenzie Barney also scored her sixth goal of the season. When sopho-more Havana Solaun’s free kick bounced off the crossbar, Barney scored on the re-bound to give the Gators a 3-0 lead. 
Florida would add a final goal in the 
67th minute, when junior midfielder Caro-line Triglia scored from 5 yards out.
The Gators clinched the SEC East with 
the win and own a half-game lead on Texas A&M with only one match left to play. 
“We definitely control our destiny and 
just have to focus on our team,” Tymrak 
said.  JONATHAN CZUPRYN

For the second time in five 
matches, Florida fell behind 2-0. 
And, for the second time in five 
matches, Chloe Mann was at the center of the Gators’ come-from-
behind win.
The junior middle blocker’s 19 
kills and .486 hitting clip were in-strumental in helping No. 11 Flor -
ida (17-2, 11-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) erase a 2-0 deficit to Texas 
A&M (15-5, 7-4 SEC) and win in five sets on the road on Sunday 
(14-25, 25-27, 25-23, 25-23, 15-6).
The Gators dug their own grave 
early against the Aggies, hitting .149 and registering 11 attacking errors in the first two sets. 
“We just struggled,” coach 
Mary Wise said. “For a team that’s been so good offensively, we were having such a hard time finding 
kills.”
Florida turned to Mann to dig 
it out of the hole. She registered 12 kills in the final three sets. She 
evened the match 2-2 by recording the Gators’ final kill of the fourth 
set. 
Wise said after Sunday’s perfor -
mance that the 6-foot-2 Gainesville native may be among the confer -
ence’s elites. 
“Chloe made another state-
ment as maybe the best player in 
the league,” Wise said. “(During) the set point in Set 4, three players 
triple jumped and she hit it over 
them.”  
Coming into this weekend, 
Mann led the SEC and ranked eighth in the country in hitting percentage with a .435 clip. She 
also ranked among the top five 
SEC players in kills.
Behind Mann, Florida came back and won after being down 
2-0 for the second time this season. 
UF first accomplished the feat at home against Kentucky on Oct. 6. 
Sunday marked Florida’s first 
road win after falling behind 2-0 since it defeated Arkansas on Nov. 
13. 
“The win at home down 0-2 is 
pretty amazing,” Wise said. “But to do this on the road, as well as 
A&M was playing in this match … I couldn’t be more proud of this 
group.”
The Gators have won 14 
straight matches, marking their longest winning streak since the 
team won 24 consecutive matches in 2010. That run ended with a loss 
to Purdue in the Regional Semifi-
nals of the NCAA Tournament. 
Florida’s last undefeated con-
ference season also came in 2010, which was the last time the Gators won the SEC.MONDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

The cornerback earned 
his second straight Swamp Studs appear-ance with two forced 
fumbles, three tackles and one tackle for loss. His strip of Gamecocks quarterback Connor Shaw on the opening play set the tone for the remainder of the game. He added another forced fumble on the 
next kickoff, but the Gamecocks recovered.
Gators defensive coordinator Dan Quinn dialed up a cornerback blitz on South Carolina’s first 
play from scrimmage. Gamecocks quarterback Connor Shaw didn’t see a charging Loucheiz Purifoy, who forced the junior to fumble. Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray recovered the ball at the South Carolina 2. Florida scored three plays later.4
Florida forced a season-high four turnovers 
against South Carolina on Saturday. The 
Gators recovered three of four forced 
fumbles and intercepted Gamecocks backup 
quarterback Dylan Thompson in the fourth 
quarter. The four takeaways led to 21 points.KEY STAT

Trailing 7-3, South 
Carolina drove 52 yards on 11 plays before at-tempting a 45-yard field 
goal. Floyd busted through the line and blocked the Adam Yates try for the second blocked kick of his career. Florida blocked a field goal for the second consecutive game and the eighth time in 20 games under coach Will Muschamp.Sharrif

Florida went three and out following 
Sharrif Floyd’s blocked field goal in the second quarter, but Trey Burton forced Ace Sanders to fumble the ensuing punt. Burton recovered his own forced fumble at the South Carolina 29-yard 
line. Florida’s touchdown on the resulting drive extended UF’s lead to 14-3. 
After South Carolina added a field goal 
at the end of the first half to pull within two possessions, Florida came out of the locker room and drove 53 yards in nine plays, capping the scoring drive with a 6-yard touchdown on a double 
handoff to Omarius Hines. The touchdown put Florida up 21 points.After Florida took a 14-3 lead with less than three minutes remaining in the first half, wide receiver Solomon Pat-ton stripped South Carolina’s Damiere Byrd on the ensuing kickoff. UF linebacker Chris Johnson recovered 
the fumble and ran to the South Carolina 1-yard line. Florida scored two plays later.
One year after dismal October, new-look Gators still undefeated
Purifoy blitzed. Gamecocks quar -
terback Connor Shaw never saw 
him coming.
Untouched, Purifoy delivered 
the blow that set the tone for Sat-
urday’s game. The ball came loose, 
and Florida had first and goal at South Carolina’s 2-yard line. Soon 
after, UF took a 7-0 lead.
“I was like ‘Oh, this is a kill 
shot. I’m going to kill him,’” Pu-
rifoy said. “When he stepped up 
and left the ball out I was like ‘You 
messed up.’ And I slapped the ball out of his hand.”
It was not the last time South 
Carolina lost its handle on the foot-ball. 
Florida forced three more fum-
bles and recovered two. The Gators scored a touchdown off each fum-ble they recovered.
UF’s 44 points were the most it 
has scored in a game this season.
After averaging just 11.8 points 
per game last October, Florida has 
scored 29.7 per game this October.
“We know that touchdowns are 
going to win games,” Driskel said. “Field goals aren’t going to win 
games consistently, so when we 
did get our opportunities, and we 
got a lot tonight, we scored touch-downs. That’s what you’re going to have to do.”
After halftime, Florida con-
tinued its trademark second-half dominance. During the third quar -
ter, the Gators buried the Game-
cocks.
Florida tallied nine first downs, 
133 yards of total offense and 16 
points. South Carolina ran eight plays for a total of minus-1 yard.
When the fourth quarter began, 
the Gators put the finishing touch-
es on their 7-0 start.
Florida’s excitement from its improbable start spilled over on 
Saturday.
Following a Jelani Jenkins in-
terception that was reversed due to an offside call, Muschamp ran over to the junior linebacker and tackled him in celebration.
“He really is the boom coach,” 
Jenkins said. “He knocked me 
out.”
Florida won its seventh game of 
the 2011 season on Jan. 2, 2012. The victory helped the Gators avoid 
their first losing season since 1979.
This year, Florida notched its 
seventh win on Oct. 21. Just 51 weeks removed from the final defeat of a winless October, the Gators are only one triumph away 
from an undefeated run through the same month in 2012.
However, Florida is on the cusp 
of something even greater. A win 
against the Bulldogs would clinch the SEC East.
One more victory against the 
SEC West champion in a de fac-
to national semifinal would put 
Florida in a position few expected 
before the season: the BCS Cham-
pionship Game in Miami.
“We’re not going to be com-
pletely satisfied until we’re in the championship at the end of the 
year,” Harrison said. “That’s our 
main goal. If we keep just working the way we’re working, I feel like we can do that.”
