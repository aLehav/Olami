 It was a different atmosphere with a differ-
ent feel and different stakes for Florida, but it 
was the same old, same old for Chris Rainey . 
  After dominating a pair of overmatched op-
ponents, Rainey and the Gators were prepared for a test against a Southeastern Conference foe. Tennessee did its best to provide a challenge, but nothing could stop Rainey on Saturday .  
  The senior running back continued to be 
the focal point of Florida’s offense, racking up 212 yards from scrimmage as the No. 15 Gators (3-0, 1-0 SEC) defeated the V olunteers (2-1, 0-1 SEC) 33-23 in The Swamp. 
  Rainey was equal parts workhorse and 
playmaker for UF, carrying the ball 21 times for 108 yards while also catching two passes for 104 yards. His effort was highlighted by a career-long 83-yard touchdown when senior quarterback John Brantley stepped up in the pocket and dumped it to Rainey at Florida’s 20-yard line. Rainey turned, saw the biggest hole he’s ever seen and never looked back, stretching Florida’s lead to 30-7. 
  “There’s probably three or four people in 
the world who can do what he does,” sopho-more running back Trey Burton said. “He’s a freak.” 
The catch-and-run was the longest by a 
running back in Florida history and the longest pass play since 1996.
  Rainey seemed to be a threat to score every 
time he touched the ball, cutting past would-be tacklers to get in space and utilize his elite speed. 
  Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis contin-
ued to dial up plays to get Rainey the ball in the open ﬁ  eld, and Brantley never hesitated to make the checkdown. 
  “Rainey is a special athlete,” Brantley said. 
“He can do some special things with the ball. … He has really grown up and bought into everything. He deserves everything that he’s been doing right now.”
  When the Gators needed to protect a 
14-point lead early in the fourth quarter, they looked to Rainey, handing him the ball on sev-en consecutive plays. 
  On the last of those runs, he was bottled up 
to the right and then darted back left, advanc-ing 8 yards before collapsing on the Tennes-see sideline. He remained on the turf for some time before getting back up, bringing to mind the only concern surrounding Rainey: durabil-ity . His 21 carries were a career high, and many question whether his 5-foot-9, 174-pound frame can handle that type of pounding. 
  “Only time will tell,” Burton said. “He did 
tonight. … He’s tough. He wants to be out there, and he’s deﬁ  nitely a big-time playmak-er.”
  Rainey’s big-play ability even showed up 
on special teams. As Tennessee attempted a punt from its own territory early in the second quarter, Rainey found a gap in the V olunteers’ line and burst through untouched to record the block and set up the UF offense at the 13-yard line.

  Linzi Sheppard, 22, is a ﬁ  fth-year ag-
ricultural education and communication 
senior.
  Rather than taking 18 credits a semester 
to catch up after she switched her major from nutrition to a specialization in com-munication and leadership development in her current major, she decided she’d rather pick up hours at her part-time jobs, become more involved on campus and graduate this December rather than last May.
  At UF, Sheppard isn’t alone.   Of the students who came to UF during 
the 2005-2006 school year, about 58 per-cent had graduated after four years. Of the remaining students in that class, about 80 percent had graduated after ﬁ  ve years.
  Universities around the United States, 
UF included, are making efforts to increase the number of students who graduate in four years. For some, that effort comes in 
the form of a four-year graduation guarantee.   This guarantee, current-ly in effect at about 15 campuses nationwide, is signed by new students, 
their parents and the uni-versity president. 
It states that provided 
students meet regularly with college ad-visers and stay on track with courses, they will graduate in no more than four years. 
  These colleges, which are mostly small 
private schools, are seeking to ease par-ents’ fears that they will end up paying ﬁ  ve or six years of costly tuition. 
  If the university fails to maintain its end 
of the agreement — if a required course is not available, or if advisers give incorrect advice — it will cover the cost of addition-al tuition needed to complete the degree.
 Some universities explore four-year graduation guarantee

Shouts of “chop from 
the top” and “stand up and 
fight back” echoed across campus Friday as about 30 members of the Gainesville chapter of Students for a Democratic Society held a protest against UF’s 15-per -
cent tuition hike. 
The increase was ap-
proved in June by UF’s Board of Trustees.
“This is a direct attack on 
public higher education,” said SDS member Ryan De-Witt, a 23-year-old anthro-pology senior. 
The group, which had the 
question of tuition increase placed on the Student Gov-ernment ballot with a peti-tion last week, protested in hopes of talking to UF Pro-vost Joe Glover.
Students marched to the Plaza of the Americas and put a giant, bright-yellow price tag for $35,000 on the 20-foot-tall “Whispering Close” statue before march-ing into Tigert Hall and UF President Bernie Machen’s office.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said while she had not expected the students to  march up to the president’s office, the administration encourages students to ex-press their views.
SDS members will have 
the chance to hear about this balance from Machen as administrators agreed to schedule an interview between the president and Conor Munro, a member chosen to represent the or -
ganization.
“I am glad we got the 
meeting,” said Munro, a 20-year-old economics sopho-more. “The administration is, quite frankly, out of touch.”

Ryan DeWitt
UF senior and SDS memberIf the reason for not graduating in four 
years lies with the student — if he or she 
changed majors, took less than a full load or chose a “long” program like engineering — the student must still pay for the additional time in school.
“It’s a nice marketing gimmick,” said 
UF Provost Joe Glover. “It may be useful in schools that have not been providing the nec-essary classes to their students, but UF has al-ways guaranteed that.”
Under UF policy , if a student is unable to get a seat in a course required to make prog-ress toward graduation, administration will work to ensure that student is able to join the class, Glover said.
UF does not offer to pay for additional 
schooling beyond four years.
Few public universities offer such a guar -
antee, but the University of Nebraska and the University of Minnesota are among those who do.EMILY MORROW

Each Friday , Lesley Wolfson and 
her husband drive an hour and a 
half from Jacksonville to Gainesville so she can learn to read lips.
Wolfson suffers from hearing 
loss caused by chemotherapy treat-ment.
At 3 p.m. on Fridays at the United 
Way of North Central Florida, 6031 NW First Place, she joins six other classmates, also affected by hearing loss, to practice lip-reading, share advice and exchange stories.
The lip-reading class, led by Pat 
Kricos, a professor in UF’s College of Public Health and Health Profes-sions, is part of a series of classes about dealing with hearing loss.
Kricos’s seven students range in 
age from the mid-50s to early 80s. They’ve all experienced hearing loss in different ways — some from birth, some from aging, and some, like Wolfson, as a result of medical issues.
“Lip reading is tough,” Kricos 
said. “But I’m so impressed by all of them. They’re here almost ev-ery week, and they always do their homework.”
Kricos’s first class of the day 
begins at 1 p.m. — an educational course on dealing with hearing loss.
Here, Kricos and her two assis-
tants, doctoral students studying to be audiologists, discuss topics like communication strategies, how to deal with difficult listening situa-tions and technologies like hearing aids.
They also discuss how to teach 
friends and family members about speaking clearly . 
Clearly does not mean louder 
or more exaggerated, Kricos said. People should speak normally but with better articulation and slight pauses in between phrases. Facing each other while in conversation can help, too, she said. 
Kricos said she often finds the 
group leads itself.
“I like the audiologists to talk 30 
percent of the time or less,” she said. “When folks find out they’re not the only ones with hearing loss, they just get talking.”
These classes offer participants 
more than a tool; they also provide a place of community.
The students, often accompanied 
by their spouses, meet other people suffering from similar conditions. They exchange advice, like who are the best audiologists in town, how to ask for accommodating rooms in a hotel or how to get a volume-ampli-fied phone.
They share their stories and frus-
trations. 
Lynn Rousseau once slept 
through a fire alarm while staying in a hotel in Washington, D.C. Sue Spencer, a bright-blue-eyed mother of five, said she has trouble hearing her son talk about his day at school when she’s cooking dinner or run-ning the dishwasher. Tom Donald-son has trouble hearing high-pitched sounds. 
“They learn that they’re not the 
only one in the world going through something like this,” Kricos said. “And that realization can be really empowering.”
The lip-reading class starts just 
after 3 p.m. Doctoral students Nicole Brakovich and Laura Davidson assist Kricos in a warm-up exercise. “Nor -
man, last week I ate at The Swamp,” Brakovich mouths silently.
It takes a couple of silent repeti-
tions before Norman Griggs under -
stands and replies out loud, “Well, why would you want to eat there?”
The class continues, focusing on 
sounds that look alike, such as the letters P , B and M, or T and D.
Kricos said it’s the people she 
meets who make her job worth-while.
“The greatest thing about my 
job is that people go out of here and really feel empowered,” she said. “They are just incredible people with indomitable spirits.” 
The classes are free and open to 
the public. 
To register for either class, call 
352-294-5151 or email mmccaghren@phhp.ufl.edu.

The United Kingdom’s Department of Health announced 
Sept. 8 it will end the lifetime ban on blood donation by men 
who have sex with other men.
The absolute ban has been lifted in favor of a 12-month 
waiting period after a man’s last sexual encounter with another man.
According to the U.K. Health Department website, the Ad-
visory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs has found no evidence supporting the continued exclusion from blood donation of men who have sex with other men, or MSM.
Dr. Kathleen Sazama, chief medical officer of LifeSouth 
Community Blood Centers in Florida, said the lifetime ban on MSM has existed in the United States since 1983.
LifeSouth serves Alabama, Georgia and Florida, and Saza-ma said on average, people in those areas donate 250,000 units of blood and platelets every year. 
Every unit of donated blood is tested for infectious agents. 
However, Sazama said, the testing is not perfect, so potential 
blood donors are screened for factors that put them at increased risk for contracting diseases.
Although there are dozens of reasons 
someone might not be able to give blood, perhaps the most controversial category of banned donors are men who have sex with other men. The lifetime ban on blood dona-
tion was put in place  when little was known about HIV and AIDS, Sazama said.
“It’s hard to make public policy that doesn’t disenfranchise 
some private citizens,” she said. 
Sazama said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which 
sets the restrictions on blood donation, discusses the ban every year. However, to lift it, the FDA must have absolute evidence showing that recipients of donated blood won’t be harmed by changing the rule.
Lauren Hannahs, director of UF’s LGBT Affairs, said the 
U.K.’s revised restriction is a step in the right direction.
 “The ban here is based on stereotypes, misconceptions and 
fear,” she said.
Hannahs said she understands why the ban was put in place 
at first, but in practice now, it reinforces the stereotype that gay men are hypersexual and that gay sex equals unsafe sex. 
Hannahs said by lifting the ban, the U.K. is providing an 
opportunity for stereotypes to be abolished. 
“I think the repealing of that ban in the U.K. will show the 
rest of the world […] that the ban is flawed and has no grounds to stand on anymore,” she said.
She believes that in the wake of the U.K. lifting the ban, sub-
sequent research and the right conversations will lead to more understanding and an eventual lifting of the ban in the U.S.UK lifts ban on blood donations from homosexuals
� RECORDS WERE PRICED FROM 50 
CENTS TO $20.
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Nearly 400 students and Gainesville resi-
dents congregated downtown Sunday after -
noon to buy, sell and trade vinyl records un-
derneath tents and amid fellow music-loving, beer-drinking folk.
Two years ago, 26-year-old Daniel Halal held the first Vinyl Fiesta on the deck joining Boca Fiesta restaurant and Palomino Pool Hall on Southeast First Street. Halal said he plans to hold another Vinyl Fiesta in the spring.
“A lot of times record shows are much big-
ger and you get these snooty, crotchety old men and it just isn’t fun,” said Halal, who used to live in Gainesville but now owns a record label and shop called Vinyl Rites in Athens, Ga. “We wanted to do a similar thing but gear it more toward our friends.”
Most of the vendors were from Gainesville, 
where they buy and sell records at shows and from their homes. Records from all music genres were for 
sale, priced from 50 cents to $20. 
Local musician and Gainesville resident 
John Berna, 24, said he was thrilled to be around vinyls. They are a piece of a larger ex-perience which he thinks is disintegrating.“The day an album came out, I’d skip 
school, go to the mall with my friends and buy it, and then we would go listen to it,” Berna said. “We’d sit at the turntable, listen to the re-cord and look at the artwork. Today, all people see is a track listing on their iTunes.”
Jim Johnston, a local resident and vendor 
at the event, said he was just happy to see so many young people buying vinyls, a medium he thought would die when CDs came out. 
“Twenty years ago I was going to record 
shows and doing the same thing,” said John-ston, 44. “It’s nice to keep it going. We gotta keep it going.”

Democrats took some 
hits last week
Last week was not a good week to be a Democrat; it 
was especially bad if you were a sitting Democratic president. 
Two special elections were held last Tuesday to deter -
mine who would represent Nevada’s 2nd House District and New York’s 9th House District. 
The latter was previously held by Twitter celebrity and 
former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner. For those who are unaware, Weiner resigned from his seat after admitting to releasing revealing photos on Twitter. 
Republicans took the Nevada seat, which was no sur -
prise to anyone given its solid GOP record.
But, to the surprise of many political analysts, the New 
York seat thought to be a Democratic stronghold went to Republican Robert Turner. 
Yet, these two events are not the only thing currently 
plaguing Democrats. 
In an effort to promote “green jobs,” the federal gov-
ernment, under the direction of the Obama administration, loaned $535 million to a California solar company called Solyndra. 
The company was praised by officials in the administra-
tion as a sound investment.
Earlier this month, however, Solyndra filed for bank-
ruptcy and laid off more than 1,000 workers.
For a president who is trying to promote a plan to create 
more jobs, this setback creates an image of incompetence created by political cronyism. The California company was politically well-connected, which has spurred many law-makers to launch an investigation of how the company was selected for this loan guarantee in the first place. 
There has been a lot of discussion about the ability of 
government to pick winners and losers in an economy through tax breaks and subsidies. 
But when the government cannot even pick a winner, 
the best press secretary would have trouble favorably spin-ning the situation. 
However, the punches do not stop with this scandal. The editorial board of Obama’s hometown paper, the 
Chicago Tribune, recently hinted to the president that he might not want to consider running for re-election. 
Stephen Chapman of the Tribune’s editorial board said 
Obama “is under no compulsion to run for re-election” and that it “might be the sensible thing to do.” 
Chapman later gave a run-around endorsement of cur -
rent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Many on the left are dissatisfied with Obama’s performance and complain about his quickness to compromise with Republicans. 
As the Republican Party begins to pick itself apart for 
the nomination, Obama will have to hope that it does most of his fighting for him, so that he might still use the “at-least-I’m-not-one-of-those-guys” strategy.
Otherwise, the Democrats are going to have to hope for 
a big “Recovery Winter.”Labor unions do not always help workers
In an era where real wages aren’t really increasing much and the rich are getting richer, it seems economically just for unions to protect workers from laws that would open 
jobs to labor force competition and market wages. 
However, this economic environment has highlighted 
how anti-worker unions can really be. 
The only natural habitat for a union in today’s global econ-
omy in the U.S. seems to be the public sector. Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker recently took away the power of collective bar -
gaining, partly because costly benefit packages were handed out to unions by politicians who would not be around when the cost of these benefits was fully realized. 
Plump pensions and Cadillac health-care plans for public 
sector unions mean that private-sector workers are unfairly taxed to provide extra benefits to their public counterparts. This crowds out non-governmental job growth, which is where long-term job creation must come from to be sustain-able.
In the private sector, labor organizers are outraged at the 
drastic move against unions. Yet only 6.9 percent of private workers are in unions, compared to 36.2 percent of their pub-lic counterparts.  
Recently, Boeing was sued by the National Labor Rela-
tions Board because the company tried to move factories from the heavily unionized state of Washington to South Carolina, a right-to-work state. 
In this economic environment, unions aren’t protecting 
their workers against evil corporations. Instead, they are pro-tecting them from the droves of unemployed citizens looking for work. 
Boeing has no moral obligation to keep jobs in the U.S. 
If the government tries to restrict Boeing’s flow of capital, Boeing can just as easily take the jobs to China. In a global economy , a state that allows powerful private-sector unions will lose jobs and experience slow economic growth. 
Perhaps there are legitimate aims for unions to pursue 
other than collective bargaining power. 
One particular example would be if a teacher were ac-
cused of misconduct by a student — claims which often prove to be unfounded — a union could provide the teacher with a lawyer to argue on his or her behalf. 
But unions often do more harm 
than good. 
Consider this hypothetical ex-
ample: Let’s say the cleaning staff at UF successfully formed a union. The union successfully presses its case for higher wages and better benefits, along with firing restric-
tions that increase job security . 
Let’s assume that before this union, UF wanted to hire 
1,000 workers, but after the union is formed, UF can only af-ford to hire 500 workers.
For the 500 people who would have had a job, these new 
regulations on the cleaning staff at UF hurt them more than the new benefits help those who were hired. Those who ad-vocate for strong collective bargaining power must realize that their efforts help some workers at the expense of others. 
There were many expressions of solidarity on Facebook 
for the striking V erizon Wireless workers a few weeks ago when the employees walked off the job. These workers filed for unemployment benefits because they weren’t being paid during the strike. They were taking advantage of a New York law that said striking workers may collect unemployment checks. 
In other words, taxpayers financed these workers’ efforts 
at getting a bigger paycheck when thousands of workers would have been glad to step in the place of the incensed V erizon labor force. 
In a country with a 9-percent unemployment rate and 
millions of families hurting in this stalled recovery, this ex-ample serves as a reminder that unions are not necessarily the friend of all working people everywhere. 
Rather, they are the friend of those lucky enough to still 
be a part of one. Cutting collective bargaining rights is a step in the right direction and will help create jobs in an economy that sorely needs them.

letters@alligator.org MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 7
   At Monday’s CNN/Tea Party Debate 
there may have been eight candidates on the stage, but all eyes, including 
those of his opponents, were on the man in the middle: Gov . Rick Perry . The majority of the evening was occupied by also-rans, such as former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bach-mann, desperately striving to stay relevant by hurling criticism at the apparent frontrun-ner. While the majority of their attacks were focused on Perry’s 2007 executive order con-cerning HPV vaccines, one of the criticisms lobbed at Perry has particular gravity for many students.
  When asked how the GOP planned to at-
tract Latino voters, Santorum immediately turned the question into an opportunity to at-tack Perry and the state of Texas for a 2001 law that allows undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates. Other candidates joined the piling-on, including Bachmann, who chimed in that “I think that the American way is not to give taxpayer-subsided beneﬁ  ts to people who’ve broken our laws.” Of course, children who are illegally brought over to this country by their parents are not criminally liable in the sense that Bachmann asserted, but the con-gresswoman has always been more disposed to sound bites than to actual policy analysis.
  Even former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Rom-
ney , a candidate who’s always sounded more “country club” than “county fair,” took the opportunity to attack the policy saying that it “only attracts people to continue to come here and continue to take advantage.”
  Why of course, Romney; it’s not potential 
employment or freedom from violence that’s driving illegal immigrants across the border. It’s the promise of $5,000 instead of $12,000 for a liberal arts degree. How blind we’ve been.
  At the root of the issue is a certain moral 
cavity that rears its head every election cycle: that politicians abandon sensible policy posi-tions for party-line talking points to pander to a base that makes up a tiny fraction of the elec-torate. In this case, both Texas’ policy and the proposed national DREAM Act are smart, ef-ﬁ  cient policies that get thrown to the wayside because Bachmann is louder when she screams for English to be the national language.
  There are already eight states other than 
Texas that offer in-state tuition rates for un-documented students including California, Il-linois, New York and candidate Jon Hunts-man’s Utah. Further-more, only two of the other seven GOP can-
didates have executive leadership experience (Huntsman and Romney), and neither has had to govern a state with a scope of issues as broad as Texas’.
  Texas’ in-state tuition policy is more than 
a civil rights, immigration or law enforcement issue  — it’s good economic sense. Currently , the state invests signiﬁ  cant funds in educating undocumented students from K-12. By deny-ing those students access to higher education or to the job market, Texas would be wasting that investment while squandering valuable human capital. The students targeted by this type of legislation are not your run-of-the-mill teenagers. They are exceptionally bright, hav-ing performed well enough to matriculate and graduate from a top university, and could im-mediately contribute to the work force.
  The only alternative would seem to be to 
deny undocumented children even basic ac-cess to education, a course of action that is as irresponsible as it is repulsive.  If the issue is truly a matter of taxes, as 
Bachmann implies, then providing a path to permanent residency should only help allevi-ate that problem. These students already pay sales tax. Why not allow them to pay income tax, property tax, etc. as well? Besides, there are already many Texans who pay less in taxes or receive more in-state beneﬁ  ts than undocu-mented families do. Yet we do not try to make a moral or economic argument to bar them from state higher education.
  To deny qualiﬁ  ed undocumented students 
access to the work force because of some asi-nine political grandstanding is a preposterous waste of human capital and state resources. Given vicious rhetoric thrown around in re-cent months and the promise of an especially contentious election, it was refreshing to see Perry defending this state’s policy amid an ever-growing rabble of fear-mongering and name-calling. 
Other moderate-conservative candidates, 
like Romney, should take note that rallying the party’s base doesn’t have to mean aban-doning sound and thoughtful policies.

   For the past year famine has pummeled the Horn of Af-
rica as a whole, but Somalia has been the hardest hit — and the situation is getting worse. 
  Severe drought has made food and water scarce enough 
to pose challenges for any nation, but it’s even more daunt-ing for Somalia, a failed state which hasn’t had a functioning government since 1990.
  In place of government control, extremist militants aligned 
with the terrorist group Al-Shabaab and roaming bandits hold sway in almost every pocket of the country outside of the capital of Mogadishu.   And of course, offshore there are the pirates, who, according to Reuters, are currently holding more than 300 foreign nationals for ransom and 40 ships captive.
  International aid groups, such as the International Red 
Cross, are struggling to respond to the most devastating fam-ine to strike the region in more than 60 years. The fact that Al-Shabaab has banned foreign-aid workers has only exacer-bated the problem.  It is easy to be discouraged 
given Somalia’s current crisis and long history of failure, but the in-ternational community must not give up on urgent efforts to help 
the innocent victims – especially women and children.
  Last week, United Nations ofﬁ  cials stated that tens of thou-
sands of Somalis, more than half of them children, have died in the last few months.   Experts predict the drought might end in October, but then, seasonal rains could exacerbate diseases such as cholera and malaria. 
    The United Nations ofﬁ  cials made an emergency appeal 
for $2.4 billion to help Somalia in July and currently are about $1 billion short.   
  But the problem of delivering aid in extremely dangerous 
conditions has somewhat eased with Al-Shabaab’s withdrawl from Mogadishu in July after a month-long siege.   But, as Jef-frey Gettleman of The New York Times wrote last week, both Al-Shabaab and the Somali government are splintering off into competing factions, and there are signs that the warfare between these groups will intensify.  
  Arab nations like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, 
Qatar and other Persian Gulf states — Somalia’s major trading partners — should use their political and economic inﬂ  uence to persuade both the Somali government and militant groups to do more to help donors deliver aid to the starving. 
  Somalia will never end its vicious cycle of devastating fam-
ines and aid dependence if both it and organizations such as the U.N. do not also make it a priority to improve governance, eradicate rampant corruption and end conﬂ  ict in the region. 
  Further, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States should use their 
regional clout to ensure that, this time, Somalia makes real progress.
  The lives of potentially millions are at stake.  Benjamin Mack writes for The Arbiter at Boise State Univer-
sity.

John Schank / Alligator
James Ingle, a City Commission candidate for the at-large 1 
seat, speaks to student activists at a protest on campus Friday.
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Standing before a crowd of about 
30 student activists Friday, James 
Ingle encouraged his younger coun-terparts to keep up the fight.
For Ingle, a City Commission 
at-large 1 candidate, the upcoming months will be filled with speeches.
There will be time for platforms 
and party disagreements. Friday was a day for protesting.
“Prepare yourself for a long 
fight,” Ingle said through a mega-phone to Students for a Democratic Society members protesting tuition hikes. “You can do great things. We can do great things. We can only do them by sticking together.”
Ingle’s pursuit to join the com-
mission is about a year in the mak-ing.
His first push for a city seat came 
this spring, when he garnered 553 votes in the District 2 race. He came in last out of four candidates. Todd Chase, a Gainesville businessman and political newcomer, won the seat.
Chrisley Carpio, a 19-year-old 
English sophomore and a member of Students for a Democratic Society, told the group Ingle is “a commend-able ally to students on campus.”
Ingle, 34, is an electrician and 
vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. For him, it all comes back to work-ers’ rights.
If elected, Ingle wants to encour -age job growth in Gainesville and make a bill of rights for apartment renters that ensures fair treatment.
Last election cycle, Ingle said 
he’d push to make sure the city hired Gainesville workers for city-funded projects.
He said jobs are the crux of the 
citywide unemployment problem.
“The sacrifices are being asked 
from the people who can least afford it,” he said.
During the last election, Ingle 
was engaged, but wedding planning came second to talking with voters.
“I am engaged to the most patient 
woman in the world,” he said in the spring of Trisha Ingle, now his wife and campaign manager.
She stood next to him on Friday 
with a sign that read “Eating ramen. You can’t afford tuition and real food” while they watched student activist leader Dave Schneider lead a chanting procession into Tigert Hall.
Along the way, Schneider threw 
a $35,000 price tag over the hands of the dancing statue on the Plaza of the Americas — statues the pro-testers called symbols of aristocracy. Students chanted, “Chop from the top!”Soon after, they marched into 
Tigert Hall and up to UF President Bernie Machen’s office, where they chanted, “We want Bernie,” and waited outside for a meeting, which was postponed until a later date.
The UF administration will never 
admit it, Ingle said to the activists, but students’ voices are a powerful tool for change.
“If it wasn’t for actions like this, 
you would all be paying block tu-ition right now,” he said, referring to the recent removal of block tuition from consideration, which he and other activists attribute to months of protesting earlier this year.
The same holds true for citywide 
issues, he said. The voice of the peo-ple is a powerful weapon.
But he said he knows it won’t be 
an easy battle.
He encouraged the student ac-
tivists not to give up, even though similar problems may come up year after year.
“Ain’t no power like the power 
of the people,” supporters chanted on their way to Machen’s office, “‘cause the power of the people don’t stop!”
Other candidates who have 
jumped into the at-large 1 race are Lauren Poe, a former District 2 City Commissioner; Donna Lutz, a UF alumna and real estate agent; Dar -
lene Pifalo, another real estate agent who has been a Gainesville resident since 1985; and Dejeon Cain, a po-lice service technician with the Uni-versity Police.
Candidate reaches out to students
“You can do great things. 
We can do great things. We 
can only do them by sticking 
together.”

talking trash, they’re talking 
trash. They’re not coming in our house and talking trash,’” Elam said. “It motivated us and pumped us up.”
However, the secondary 
also committed seven penalties, dropped several would-be inter-ceptions and blew assignments that resulted in touchdowns.
Junior safety Josh Evans 
picked off Tennessee’s Tyler Bray on the first play of the second half for Florida’s first interception of the season, and Elam snagged an overthrown ball late in the fourth quarter to seal the game.
Still, Bray threw for 288 yards 
and three scores against Florida — two of which coach Will Mus-champ described as mental er-rors in the secondary.
“We did our job, he was just 
getting the ball out quick,” Elam said. “For a secondary, you re-ally can’t do nothing if the quar-terback gets the ball out quick. ... All you got to worry about is tackling. You can’t get beat by a ball thrown over your head.” 
Bray’s numbers could have been gaudier if not for 100 yards worth of penalties against Flor-ida’s secondary, including five pass interference calls for 75 yards. 
Elam attributed the penalties 
to Florida taking a physical ap-proach to a Tennessee passing offense that entered the game ranked ninth in the nation. Still, Muschamp would prefer fewer flags.
“I don’t 
want no pass interference,” M u s c h a m p said. “I don’t want a call. But 
we’re going to play aggres-sive. We’re not going to play 
soft, I can tell you that.”
Overall, Muschamp was 
pleased with the group’s physi-cal effort Saturday, as was Elam.
“We’re young in the second-
ary and we stood strong and handled our business,” Elam said. “We followed the coaches’ plan and we ended up being suc-cessful.”

Defensive end/linebacker Ronald Powell pressured Tennessee quarterback 
Tyler Bray into throwing an interception to start the second half Saturday.
DefenSe , from page 16DBs flagged seven 
times for 100 yardsPass rush affected Bray, Volunteers
But he defended the play of his secondary, 
saying the aggressive nature with which it plays 
can result in penalties. Clearly irritated, Mus-champ made his way to midfield and was jaw-ing at the officials on the way to the locker room at halftime.
“If they call it, it’s a foul,” he said of the mul-
tiple pass interference calls. “As I eval
uate the 
film, I may tell a young man, ‘You were in good po-
sition here.’ But if they call it, it’s a foul.”
Cornerback Marcus Roberson had an intercep-
tion nullified on a questionable interference call in the third quarter.
Pass rush comes alive: After looking ineffective 
at times in Florida’s first two games, the pass rush showed up in force Saturday against Tennessee. 
The Gators sacked Volunteers quarterback Ty-
ler Bray three times and pressured him another six. They also had six tackles for loss, and defen-sive tackle Dominique Easley lived in the Tennessee backfield.
Pressured by Ronald Powell, Bray threw an in-
terception to safety Josh Evans at the start of the sec-ond half and another to safety Matt Elam that sealed the game.
Florida had just two sacks through its first two 
games against FAU and UAB.
Elam, Rogers talk trash:  Elam and Tennessee 
wide receiver Da’Rick Rogers exchanged barbs on 
Twitter last week and it carried over into pre-game warmups and Saturday’s game.
Rogers’ first Tweet, which has been deleted, read: 
“gonna eat boiled Cajun peanuts off top of your DBs heads.” Elam replied: “So Tennessee wide receivers talking trash??! Haha ok good job!” 
Elam then said: “Let your game film do the talk-
ing & no disrespect to Montana & Cincinnati but you really don’t have any!” That Tweet has since been deleted, but Rogers responded: “Tweets of a terrified DB.” 
Elam broke up a two-point conversion attempt 
aimed at Rogers and also broke up a pass intended for Rogers in the third quarter. Rogers finished the game with five catches for 62 yards and a score, but it was Elam’s interception that sealed the Florida win.
Etc.:  Backup linebacker Dee Finley did not dress 
and did not play in Saturday’s game after he was arrested last Monday on charges of driving with a suspended license and resisting arrest. … Tight end Jordan Reed (hamstring) was on Florida’s dress ros-ter for Saturday’s game but did not suit up or play. Tight end A.C. Leonard played for the first time this season after tearing the meniscus in his right knee during training camp. … Defensive lineman Sharrif Floyd was a team captain, and he received a standing ovation after making a tackle in the third quarter. It was his first game back from a NCAA-imposed suspension for receiving impermissible benefits during recruitment. ... Former Gators quar -
terback Danny Wuerffel spoke to the team on Fri-day and former running back Emmitt Smith did so on Saturday.

The block was the fifth blocked kick of 
Rainey’s career, tying the UF record for 
blocked kicks.  
“Just block the ball and scoop and score,” 
Rainey said. “That’s all that’s in my head.”
Rainey , Burton and fellow running back 
Jeff Demps were busy all game, combining to touch the ball on 44 of Florida’s 64 plays from scrimmage. 
Burton said the Gators’ plan coming into 
the game was to pound the Volunteers with their running attack. 
“We felt like we could be more physi-
cal on the offensive line, and that’s what we did,” Burton said. 
Florida established its backs early, as 
Burton, Demps or Rainey touched the ball on 16 of the team’s first 17 snaps. 
Florida’s methodical offense imposed its 
will on Tennessee, and Burton said he could feel the defense getting tired by the end of the first quarter. 
The Gators’ playmakers made life easy 
for Brantley , who was 14-of-23 passing for 213 yards and two touchdowns. Of his 14 completions, only three were caught far -
ther than 5 yards downfield. Ten of those passes went to Burton, Rainey or Demps, who were the team’s three leading receivers. Demps had four catches for 37 yards, while Burton had four grabs for 38 yards and a touchdown. Burton also added a score on the ground. 
“It’s hard for me to sit there and not take 
the ball and put it in Jeff Demps, Chris Rain-ey and Trey Burton’s hands at this point,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
The trio combined for 338 of Florida’s 
347 yards of total offense, helping the Gators grind out a win and get the SEC season start-ed on the right foot.
Saturday was just the first step in the 
quest for a conference title — UF’s ultimate goal — but it was an important one, none-theless. 
As it was for Rainey, who has battled 
through injuries and the stigma surround-ing last year’s suspension to become what he is today: the star of a thriving offense.
“Just stay focused,” Rainey said. “Your 
time will come. For me, it was an emotional game. I just had to do what I had to do.”

� UF BEAT MSU 3-0 ON FRIDAY.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Writer
 
To err is human, but the Gators are slow-
ly overcoming that. 
No. 7 Florida (8-2, 1-0 SEC) cracked 
down on mistakes in a 3-0 (25-20, 25-18, 26-
24) victory against Mississippi State (6-5, 1-1 Southeastern Conference) on Friday.
After averaging 5.4 errors per set in their 
previous three matches, the Gators lowered that number to four in Starkville, Miss.
“The players did especially well on of-
fense in attacking,” coach Mary Wise said. “When you play aggressively , the game is based on errors, so you try to eliminate the unforced ones and I thought we were very efficient offensively.”
That efficiency showed up on the stat 
sheet, as five of the six Gators who recorded a kill against the Bulldogs had a hitting per -
centage of at least .281, led by setter Kelly Murphy (.500) and middle blocker Betsy Smith (.444)
Murphy didn’t stop there, as she tallied 
10 kills, 19 assists and 11 digs to post her second consecutive triple-double, and the 25th of her career.
Her ninth and 10th kills came on the fi-
nal two plays of the match, propelling UF to a 26-24 win in the third set.
“It’s hard not to recognize Kelly Murphy 
for a triple-double,” Wise said. “And Betsy Smith as well — she may not get as many attempts, but she takes advantage of them. That and her four blocks are outstanding in three sets.”
Not far behind Murphy and Smith was 
junior right-side hitter Tangerine Wiggs, who continued to be the hot hand for the Florida offense.
Wiggs delivered several clutch plays 
throughout the match and racked up 11 kills and five block assists to go along with a .375 hitting percentage.
“We continue to see Tangerine Wiggs as 
a big-time point-scorer in terms of both her attacking and her blocking,” Wise said.
Wiggs’ heroics included two kills and a 
Smith-aided stuff block during an 8-1 run that clinched the first set.  
She also had a kill in the third set that 
ended a 7-1 Bulldogs run and pulled the 
Gators within one point of the lead at 15-14.
While the Flor -
ida offense saw 
a marked improvement in the conference opener, the defense may have been even better.
After averaging just 14.7 digs per set in 
its final three non-conference tilts, UF re-corded 51 total digs Friday.
Leading the way for the Gators in that 
category was redshirt freshman Taylor Un-roe, who had a match-best 15.
“The numbers cannot be disputed,” 
Wise said. 
“Although our total may be improving 
— especially with 21 digs in the first set — I just feel that we also continue to leave some plays out there.”Florida minimizing mistakes

UF VolleyballFlorida score on half of its attempts, 
as Kansas’ keeper had trouble control-ling incoming shots after giving up the early 1-0 lead.
Freshman Annie Speese, who 
scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Missouri on Friday, added Florida’s second goal just 12 minutes after An-nis. 
The midfielder buried a ricocheted 
shot by fellow freshman Havana So-laun, which bounced off the goalkeep-er’s  hands and rolled free at the left post. 
Playing at forward, Solaun fired in 
another goal four minutes later in the 24th minute after her own deflected shot rebounded back to her in front of goal.
“We’re always hopefully making 
progress (offensively), if not, then we’re not doing what we’re supposed to in practice,” Speese said. 
“We’re just starting to know each 
other even more, and I think that has a lot to do with our team chemistry overall.”
With a 3-0 lead in hand, the Gators 
continued to keep their pace, as 20 of the squad’s 22 traveling players saw action in the first half against the Jay-hawks.
Florida closed the final two minutes 
of the first half in a scoring frenzy. 
Junior midfielder McKenzie Barney 
buried her second goal of the year in the 44th minute, which was followed by senior Lindsay Thompson adding the latest first-half goal in Florida his-tory as time expired in the final min-ute.
“They were counting down the 
10-second clock. She kept her compo-sure and slipped in the ball just at the last second,” Burleigh said of Thomp-son’s first-half thriller. 
“It was good for her stay focused, 
despite the fact the clock was running down.”
To start the second half, Burleigh 
played mostly her second line, leading to two Kansas goals. 
Senior goalie Brooke Chancey con-
ceded scores in both the 53rd and 58th minutes. 
The coach, however, was able to 
quickly remedy the situation with the substitutions of starters Jazmyne Avant and Kat Williamson back into the defense minutes later.
The Gators staved off any chance 
of a Jayhawks’ comeback when junior Erika Tymrak punched in a penalty shot just 3:41 into the second half and Annis added a late insurance goal in the 88th minute. 
Florida has five days off before 
traveling to Athens, Ga., on Friday to play Georgia.

� NO. 9 FLORIDA BEAT KANSAS 
7-2 ON SUNDAY.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
With light rain slicking the field 
in Lawrence, Kan., just before warm-
ups, all the Gators had to do Sunday was find an open shot and watch as the Jayhawks let the game slip right through their fingers. 
In its final tune-up before South-
eastern Conference  play, No. 9 Flori-da (7-2) poured in five first-half goals, two off goalie deflections, to put Kan-sas (6-3) away early in a convincing 7-2 win.
“We did a really good job of mov-
ing the ball well and catching Kansas out of position,” UF coach Becky Bur -
leigh said. 
“It’s difficult to recover when the 
ball’s moving that quickly. The fin-
ishes became rela-tively easy after the way we moved the ball.”
The Gators were able to dominate 
possession and create dangerous chances throughout the match, as 11 of their 14 shots found the target and pressured Jayhawks goalie Kat Liebe-trau. 
Both sophomore defender Maggie 
Rodgers (two assists) and senior for -
ward Tahnai Annis (two goals) capi-talized on Kansas’ porous defense with banner days offensively. The pair teamed up on Florida’s opening score eight minutes in, and closing goal two minutes before the final whistle.
“I specifically remember before the 
game and right after that first cross happened, I was headed over to Mag-gie and was like, ‘We can do this all game. If you cross the ball, I promise I’m going to be in there to finish it,’” Annis said.

Maybe the Gators didn’t approach Saturday’s 
matchup against the Volunteers like any other game.
Their secondary didn’t, at least.
Following the 33-23 Florida win, safety Matt Elam 
walked out of the locker room and flashed a lami-nated poster to a group of reporters huddled around him.
“Y’all seen this?” he asked.It featured Tennessee’s star receiving duo of 
Da’Rick Rogers and Justin Hunter, and displayed quotes about how the two were going to take advan-tage of Florida’s young, inexperienced secondary. 
All of Florida’s defensive backs had it hanging in 
their lockers throughout the week.
“These two guys were talking a lot of trash about 
what they were going to do to us, about how we were too small, too slow,” Elam said. “They were basically saying how they were in a groove and how they were going to dominate us.”
For all the talking between both sides, Florida 
tried to let its game speak for itself in both teams’ Southeastern Conference opener and the first true test for the Gators’ secondary.
That test came back with mixed results Saturday.Florida’s defensive backfield forced two take-
aways and limited the Vols’ one-two punch of Rog-ers and Hunter to a combined 74 yards and one touchdown. But Hunter left the game with a knee injury in the first quarter after recording a catch on UT’s first series.

Florida coach Will Muschamp was thrilled after beating Ten-
nessee 33-23 in The Swamp on Saturday, but he wasn’t happy 
with the excessive number of penalties the Gators racked up.
Florida was flagged 16 times for 150 yards, including six 
pass interference calls. The 16 penalties tied for second-most in a single game in Florida history, and the 150 yards were second only to a 152-yard day against Kentucky in 1987. 
On the Gators’ second series of Saturday’s game, the offense 
sputtered thanks to a holding call on right tackle Chaz Green and then a false start on first down at the Tennessee 20-yard line. The drive stalled, ending in one of kicker Caleb Sturgis’ 
career-high four field goals.
“Those are things that have got to get cor -
rected,” Muschamp said. “Are they being ad-dressed? Yes. Are they being addressed the right way? Obviously not, because they’re still happening.”
Florida had nine penalties a week ago 
against UAB and nine against Florida Atlantic in the season opener.
Muschamp was most upset with what he called breakdowns 
in discipline — false starts, lining up offside and holding calls. Penalties concern Muschamp after win Records first two
