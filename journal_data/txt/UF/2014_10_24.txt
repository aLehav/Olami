Gainesville’s Pride cel-
ebration will include three 
new events this weekend, 
along with the annual pa-
rade and festival Saturday that draws thousands to Uni-versity Avenue.
The celebration will in-
clude a pub crawl, an ‘80s themed dance and a Sunday brunch, said Terry Fleming, co-president of North Cen-tral Florida’s Pride Commu-
nity Center.
“It’s about providing a 
bigger experience for visitors 
from outside of Gainesville,” Fleming said. “We’re trying 
to recognize that folks want 
different options.”
Friday’s “Girls Just Want 
to Have Fun” Womyn’s 
Dance is open to all self-
identiﬁ  ed women. Tickets are $25, and the 9 p.m. dance will be held at the Hippo-drome State Theatre.
The Pride Pub Crawl starts 
Friday at 9 p.m. Participants can pay $20 for a variety of food and drink specials start-ing at The Jones B-Side and ending at University Club.
The parade will start at 
noon Saturday, and Demo-cratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Was-serman Schultz will serve as 
its grand marshal. The free 
festival begins at 1 p.m. that day.
UF Pride Student Union 
internal vice president Da-mian Gonzalez said his or-
ganization will walk in the 
parade and participate at the festival.
“We want a community 
that’s inclusive,” the 20-year-old UF political science and journalism junior said, “and this is able to give that to them.”Gainesville hosts

“All the fried stuff,” White said.

◗ PATIENTS RANGE FROM TWO 
DAYS TO 21 YEARS OLD.
LAUREN BOBEK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andrew Weatherly, 17, put a face on his 
plastic pumpkin while eating fresh donuts 
Thursday inside the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital. 
Dunkin’ Donuts brought donuts and 
40 plastic pumpkins to the hospital for its Pumpkins for Munchkins event. 
During the Halloween event, hospital 
patients decorated plastic pumpkins and took pictures with Sprinkles, the Dunkin’ Donuts mascot. 
Child life assistant Ashley Auplant coor-
dinates with organizations to bring hands-on activities to Shands for patients with 
sensitive immune systems. 
“We always try to do interactive things 
with the children while they’re here,” Au-
plant said. “It helps to normalize their stay and provide a distraction.”
While patients can’t experience pump-
kin carving in the hospital, they were able to glue faces onto their realistic plastic pump-kins donated by Dunkin’ Donuts. 
Some patients are in intensive-care situ-
ations and held in isolation because of the monitors and heavy equipment, Auplant said. The child life specialists at the hospi-tal bring activities directly into the rooms of children who can’t normally participate with the others in the community play-
room. The patients range in age from two 
days to 21 years old. 
“Even patients who are immunally com-
promised sometimes come into the play-room with a mask on and lift it to eat ice cream,” said child life specialist Amanda McLeod.
The holiday season at Shands is planned 
around specific themed events. These plas-tic pumpkins allow the patients to take the Halloween experience into their rooms. Due to allergies, germs and safety, no real 
flowers or plants are allowed in the hospital 
rooms, McLeod said. 
The Dunkin’ Donuts & Baskin-Robbins 
Community Foundation dedicates a week every year to give back to the community.
“We thought we could come in and 
make the kids’ Halloween a little brighter,” said Betsy Beck, a marketing manager of Dunkin’ Brands.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2014

The change in venue wasn’t the 
only tradition affected at Gator 
Growl this year.
Every year, the Collegiate Vet-
erans Society at UF rolls out the 
American flag on the field during 
the national anthem. This presenta-tion of the colors wasn’t included in the Oct. 17 show — the 50-foot by 30-foot flag was too large for Flavet Field to accommodate.
Understanding the flag’s logis-
tical issues, the group’s president, Marcus Tucker, said he worked 
with Growl staff to stand on stage 
and wave during an appreciation video. But the night before dress rehearsals, he was verbally told the society would not be in the show. Tucker was not given wristbands allowing the group to be on stage.
Tucker said he first contacted 
the Growl committee in the sum-
mer about participating in 2014 
Growl. When he didn’t get a re-sponse by September, he reached out to Alexander Wagner, director of UF Student Government’s Veter-ans Affairs cabinet.
In an Oct. 14 email from Growl 
producer Devin McDaniel to Wag-ner, she wrote the following:
“Unfortunately this year, due to 
the fact that we have no reserved seating, we need no volunteer ush-ers to assist our guests. And, be-cause Gator Growl isn’t over Vet-eran’s Day Weekend, as it was for the past two years, we don’t have a ‘show block’ designated to recog-nizing those serving our Country. 
Please know that this is no disre-
spect to all of those working on our behalf both nationally and abroad. It simply has to do with the flow of the show which is focused on enter-tainment for a broad audience. We will continue to present The Colors and feature the National Anthem, but we won’t be able to showcase the College Veterans Society.”
Tucker said he never saw Mc-
Daniel’s email to Wagner. Wagner did not respond for comment. 
“We weren’t doing it to be in the 
spotlight, but you’re telling us that November is the only appropriate time to do something towards the veterans,” he said.
McDaniel said this was a misun-
derstanding between the two orga-nizations.
“Having a grandfather who was 
a veteran who recently passed, I have the utmost respect for veter-ans and would never do anything to offend them personally or their organization as a whole,” she said.
Tucker said he is disappointed 
in the way Gator Growl handled the situation. Some of the society’s members didn’t ride in the annual homecoming float this year be-cause the event was under Florida Blue Key.
“The people who would be the 
future leaders of the club I’m sure will be very reluctant to have any-
thing to do with Gator Growl next 
year,” Tucker said.
Homecoming Chairman Evan 
Schauder said the staff did not in-tend to exclude the society, and they still had the salute to the vet-erans during the National Anthem.
“They’re a huge part of this 
country and The Gator Nation, and 
we love showing off the veterans 
that we have on campus,” Schaud-er said. “We were in no way trying to disrespect them.”Veterans Society not

Can young people help halve extreme poverty 
rates or halt the spread of HIV/AIDS? The U.N. 
thinks so.
Model U.N. members from UF and Santa Fe 
College discussed the critical role youth has in global improvement at a conference Thursday at the Gainesville Women’s Club. The discussion also 
included reducing child mortality and sustaining 
the environment. 
City Commissioner Randy Wells kicked off the 
conference by introducing the student panelists, who addressed Millenium Development Goals, the 
eight-goal, 15-year plan the U.N. first announced.
These goals encourage positive change, said 
Brandon Gilliland, a dual-enrolled anthropology 
junior at UF and Santa Fe.
“Great strides have been made (toward achiev-
ing the development goals),” the 31-year-old said, but “there still is room for improvement.”
The six goals conference attendees deemed 
most important were education, access to sanita-
tion and clean water, health care, affordable food, 
climate change and responsive, honest govern-ment.
Brian Mitchell, a 73-year-old former U.N. staff 
member who was at the conference, said the goals have been largely successful. 
“The Millennium Goals have been achieved in 
part or in full since they were set in the year 2000,” 
said Mitchell, who’s worked with several U.N. 
agencies and helped refugees in countries like Bei-rut. “I think you only have to look at the result of those goals to say the U.N. is achieving a heck of a lot.”
Jordan Ross, an officer with UF’s Model U.N. 
club, said seeing young people passionate about world issues gives the community peace of mind.
“It’s really important to know that our genera-
tion is going to be relatively knowledgeable about these issues, especially since we’re going to be the ones dealing with them,” the 19-year-old UF bio-chemistry sophomore said.UF, Santa Fe Model UNs joinPATRICK PINAK

The Friends of the Library 
fall book sale kicks off Saturday, 
when more than 500,000 donat-
ed items will line warehouse 
shelves through Wednesday.
The sale includes books, 
CDs, DVDs, board games, 
puzzles, maps and postcards 
— some hundreds of years old. The 430 N. Main St. doors open at 9 a.m. “I think it’s just sort of a 
tradition for people,” said Bill Watson, book sale chairman. “Everyone has a specific in-terest, and they can find what 
they’re looking for here.”
The sale runs Saturday 
through 6 p.m., Sunday from 
1 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday and Tuesday from noon to 7 p.m. 
and Wednesday from noon to 
6 p.m. Most books are priced from 50 cents to $4, Watson said.
Volunteer Linda Connell said the organization received both local and national dona-tions — about 150,000 more 
than in spring.
Last fall’s sale generated 
about $150,000, she said. The 
money went to the library dis-trict to fund books and scholar-ships.
Robbie Davis has been vol-
unteering with the sale for 26 years and said the biannual 
event always draws a line of 
people down Main Street wait-ing to get in.

For the ﬁ  rst time, the UF Center for 
Latin American Studies hosted the ﬁ  fth 
Conference on Immigration in the U.S. South on Thursday.
The three-day “immigration reform 
and beyond” conference is hosting pan-els focusing on immigration, including immigrant detention, immigrant health care and education issues, and legal and policy issues.
Philip Williams, conference co-chair-
man and director of the Center for Latin American Studies, kicked off the day’s program in Emerson Alumni Hall.
At the event, he said UF students 
should gain a deeper understanding of immigration because there are multiple dimensions to it.
“Many UF students come from immi-
grant families and are immigrants them-selves, so this issue hits home,” Williams said. 
He said there are several myths and stereotypes about immigration, and he hopes the conference will spark conver-sation.
Thomas Wenski, keynote speaker 
and Archbishop of Miami, also spoke during the conference.
One panel out of the six held Thurs-
day, titled “Immigration and Public Opinion,” discussed how less-educated Americans and those who have a pessi-mistic view about the state of the econo-my are most threatened by immigrants.
Carla Frais, a 20-year-old UF interna-
tional studies junior, attended the ﬁ  rst day of the conference. She said in order for immigration reform to occur, the in-formation made public about immigra-tion must change.
“The world is changing; People have 
to adapt,” Frais said. “I wish people would be more informed. Young people 
aren’t really into politics, so there’s a dis-
connect between them and the issues.”
For participants who registered be-
fore the Oct. 17 deadline, the conference continues through Saturday.FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5
◗ CANCER PATIENT BRITTANY MAY-
NARD, 29, WILL TAKE HER OWN LIFE.
KELSEY JORDAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The same day the Florida Gators kick off 
against the University of Georgia in Jackson-
ville, 29-year-old Brittany Maynard will decide whether to take her own life in Oregon. 
Oregon is one of three states where termi-
nally ill residents can legally request physician-assisted death through lethal medication. May-nard chose to move there with her family after doctors diagnosed her with a stage four brain tumor in April, giving her about six months to live. 
Her story sparked a viral discussion about 
Oregon’s Death with Dignity act, which Nor-berto Katz, the state Bar family law chairman, 
said Florida is not pushing for at this time.
“Some people who are very religious be-
lieve the sanctity of life is paramount, and it’s 
up to a higher being, not us, to decide when a life begins or ends,” Katz said. “I don’t think that Florida is to the point where the legisla-ture would pass something like that. It would be doubtful.”
Thirteen years ago, 20-year-old UF business 
junior Kimberly Riddle’s grandfather was di-agnosed with chronic leukemia. Doctors said he had ﬁ  ve years left to live. Her family never considered lethal injection, Riddle said, and he died a decade later.
“If he had taken that pill and not fought for 
it, that would have been ﬁ  ve quality years I wouldn’t have had with him,” Riddle said.
In an article Maynard wrote for CNN, she 
said without the Death with Dignity option, she would have probably suffered in hospice care while her family had to watch.
But Fernando Petry said that is not what 
hospice is about.
“Why let them euthanize themselves when 
their family could possibly be giving them the same level of care and really be with them?” 
said Petry, Haven Hospice’s vice president and 
chief medical ofﬁ  cer. 
“I don’t know if it would beneﬁ  t people,” 
he said, “but I think that the patient having the ability to make the choice at the end of life of how they would like to die is as important as making the choice of how you want to live.”Death with Dignity discussionCAMPUSUF hosts Conference on

The Georgia Democratic Party wants black voters to

tion between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue is one of the races to watch in determining which party will control the U.S. Senate for the next two years. To encourage voter turnout, the Democratic Party of Georgia created and released ﬂ  iers featuring images of black protesters in Ferguson outraged over the murder of teenager Mike Brown. The ﬂ  iers read “If you want to prevent another Ferguson in their future — vote. It’s up to you to make change happen.” This was an obvious at-tempt to pull on the heartstrings of black Democrats who sympathized with the Brown family and the Ferguson movement.
This gesture is misguided, to say the least. Turning out 
to vote is the responsible and right thing to do, especially in state and local elections. However, the reality is that blacks in this country are voting for government structures that set them up for failure. These institutions include the nation’s police departments, which are ostensibly tasked with restoring peace and order to our communities. This is what Phillip Agnew and Shamile Louis of the Dream Defenders and Malcom London of the Black Youth Project 100 tried to explain on Wednesday at a forum at Gaines-ville’s esteemed Civic Media Center. These are three black activists who only see voting as a partial solution to end-ing police brutality. The impact of the police on black com-munities has real-life implications.
Appealing to black voters ignores one big issue: Po-
lice militarization is not isolated to the city of Ferguson. It occurs all around America. The Department of De-fense, through its Excess Property Program, provides military-grade equipment to any city that reports any kind of domestic threats, particularly narcotics. The city of Gainesville itself has acquired military-style weapons and military-style training within its police force. The precedent of police ac-
tion in Ferguson unfortunately makes militarization in cities and towns across America, including Gainesville, much more possible. The fact that weapons used in the mountains of Iraq and Af-ghanistan are being used against American citizens should be baf-
ﬂ  ing and shocking to everyone.  
Again, voting is a fundamental right that every citizen 
should exercise. Turning out the black vote, however, un-fortunately doesn’t dismantle the system that sees blacks as less than equal. Today, through the media and through the criminal justice system, society sees blacks as robbers, thieves, troublemakers and ultimately unhuman. That as-sertion may sound harsh, but it is important to mention that this narrative is not perpetuated by whites, blacks or individual persons, but is upheld by a system that ignores the humanity of blacks. Using the vote does bring about change through elected ofﬁ  cials who will repeal laws, amend laws or create new ones to beneﬁ  t society, but get-ting Democrats elected can only go so far in reining in the police.
Missouri has a Democratic governor and attorney gen-
eral. The St. Louis County Executive is also a Democrat, yet police militarization has retained its legitimacy. Police brutality is nothing new. It has been a tool for protecting the state and the property of elites for many years.
All people should pay attention to state and local poli-
tics because they are important and vital to ensuring rep-resentation. However, voting and elections are only means to an end. Human beings who dress, speak, think and act differently than you do are still human beings and deserve respect simply by virtue of their existence.

On Wednesday, Politico published an opinion piece titled 
“No, BP Didn’t Ruin the Gulf.” The article was written by 
Geoff Morrell, BP’s senior vice president of U.S. communica-
tions and external affairs. The column was a blatant attempt at whitewashing the immense environmental damage caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. It’s worth mention-
ing that Politico’s daily “Playbook” advertisements email is 
frequently sponsored by BP, a fact that was not disclosed in 
Morrell’s column. Politico’s editors might beneﬁ  t from anoth-

Superhero movie enthusiasts have long been awaiting the 
release of Marvel’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” the sequel to 
the critically acclaimed 2013 ﬁ  lm, “The Avengers.” The ﬁ  rst 
trailer for the new ﬁ  lm was supposed to air during the next 
episode of “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” on ABC. Unfor-tunately for Marvel, the trailer was leaked on Wednesday, a 
full week ahead of its planned air date. But Marvel took the 
incident in stride. In response to the leak, the company’s of-
ﬁ  cial Twitter account tweeted “Dammit, Hydra,” a reference 
to the terrorist organization that serves as the antagonist in the “Avengers” series. An even-superheroes-can-laugh-at-
themselves LAUREL goes to Marvel.
Many of Fox News’ primetime hosts like Greg Gutfeld, 
Bob Beckel and Sean Hannity have gotten into trouble for 
their controversial and sometimes deeply offensive state-
ments about women — particularly young, single women. 
However, “The Five” co-host Kimberly Guilfoyle proved this 
week that you don’t have to be male to be anti-woman. Dis-
cussing voting, Guifoyle suggested that young women do not 
have the same “life experience” as other people and therefore 
should not vote: “They’re like healthy and hot and running 
around without a care in the world. They can go back on Tin-
der or Match.com.” If Guifoyle thinks that all young women 
care about is dating and their physical appearance, perhaps 
she is the one lacking in “life experience.” A how-can-a-wom-
an-be-so-anti-woman? DART goes to Kimberly Guilfoyle.
By now, the NFL’s domestic violence problem is well- 
known. The high-proﬁ  le Ray Rice incident left a mark on the 
NFL’s already shady track record on the issue. Fortunately, 
a number of current and former NFL players are speaking 
out against domestic violence and sexual assault with a new 
PSA sponsored by the No More Project. Among the ﬁ  gures 
appearing in ad are NFL executive Troy Vincent and William Gay, both of whom grew up in abusive homes. A PSA by it-
self won’t solve the NFL’s failure to seriously address domes-
tic violence, but it is a good place to start. A step-in-the-right-
direction LAUREL goes to the No More Project.

Weddings are usually a fun affair — an excuse to 
eat, drink and be merry. 
My sister’s wedding is today, and I am thrilled for 
a chance to celebrate the marriage of two of my best friends. 
More than that, I was thrilled that as a maid of honor, I 
got to throw a bachelorette party.
If a wedding is a classy affair to celebrate love and com-
mitment, a bachelor or bachelorette party is the complete opposite.
I was excited that throwing one would give me an excuse 
to get drunk and to buy all the penis paraphernalia X-Mart carries.
When I left for her bachelorette weekend, I had in tow 
with me penis straws, a penis water gun, penis sprinkles, a penis cookie cutter and the jewel — family, I’d presume — of the party, a penis cake.
It was a regular old penis party.Now let me tell you a thing about women. This certainly 
doesn’t apply to everyone, but it happens on a fairly regular basis: If you get a group of girls together, the conversation will eventually turn phallic.
This is only magniﬁ  ed when you throw in some alcoholic 
beverages that you’re encouraged to suck down through a surprisingly anatomically accurate straw.
So there I was last weekend with a plastic penis in my 
mouth, talking about dicks with my sister and her friends. It’s a phrase not often said.
I’d like to tell you that after all our discussion, we were 
all in agreement on penises.
I’d like to say that we came up with the perfect formula 
for dicks — have X, Y and Z and you’ll be able to please every man, woman and person you meet!
But, as with most other facets of sexuality, everyone has 
a different opinion.
While that might make it difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  gure out what one 
individual wants or likes, that also means that somewhere out there are people who think your penis is the best they’ve ever come across.
There was a girl who thought dicks were weird and un-
pleasant to look at — although to be fair, she said the same 
about vulvas. One woman said cocks are her favorite male 
body part.
There were varying opinions on shafts and balls — some 
preferred one to the other, some liked neither, one person was a fan of the whole…pack-age.  
There were some things that 
we came to a consensus on, though.
First off, size doesn’t matter 
too much.
Maybe there just weren’t any 
size queens at the party, but none of us were too concerned 
with measurements.
One girl explained that the guy she was seeing right now 
isn’t the biggest she’s ever had, but he makes up for it by being really good at everything else.
Sex isn’t just about penis-in-vagina penetration, so you 
don’t size up — pun intended — to other people if you’re 
only good for having a big dick.
I hate to break it to you, dudes, but a big cock probably 
won’t get someone off more than an average-sized one.
It’s almost too cheesy to quote but, “It’s not the size of 
the boat, but the motion of the ocean.”
A lot of women will be more satisﬁ  ed if you can sup-
plement your P-in-V action with some impressive hand or 
mouth skills.
We also agreed that the penis in question is almost al-
ways made better if you actually like the person attached to it.
There’s usually a direct correlation between the affection 
toward someone and the enjoyment of that person’s geni-talia.
The most important opinion is yours, though. It doesn’t 
really matter — as much as I like to think it does — what I, or anyone else for that matter, think about your dick.
If you feel comfortable with your own body, that will 
show.
It’s important to be conﬁ  dent with your own body parts 
— however weird or funny to talk about they might be.
So for the conclusion of this column, I tried hard to come 
up with a penis joke.
But unfortunately, it just wouldn’t come.

opinions@alligator.org “Yes, I still remember everything.” Thus 
begins my grandmother’s autobiogra-phy. At age 89, she is proud of her de-
tailed memory, but she is also cursed by it. 
My grandmother’s 
name is Susan. When she was 19, she was 
taken with her moth-
er to the Ravensbruck concentration camp for women in Northern Germany.
From there, she was taken to a factory in 
a town called Chemnitz and forced to work long hours with little food. 
Here is an excerpt from her story, pub-
lished in the Sun Sentinel: 
“One fellow worker had hidden her preg-
nancy successfully and gave birth in their barracks in secret. However, ‘the woman didn’t have milk,’ and the baby cried, giving its presence away. ‘An SS woman came in, 
got the child, grabbed it by its legs, and hit 
it against the wall, killing it. They shot the mother just after the baby was killed.’”
A lack of breast milk indicates severe 
malnourishment.
When my grandmother escaped with her 
mother, she tells us she said the same thing as Scarlett O’Hara in “Gone With the Wind” — “I’m never going to be hungry again.”
Today, Susan wishes she could be a little 
bit hungry again. 
Another short anecdote that my grand-
mother often shares is her prediction of the 
future. As a child, she loved to read. Eating, 
to her, meant spending time away from her books. She dreamed of a future in which all our meals could be consumed in pill form, freeing us up for reading, or whatever peo-
ple of the future would do with their time. 
Today, she jokes that her dream has come 
true. A motley assortment of pills have be-
come a staple of her diet, and she is able to 
eat little else. Appetite suppression is just 
one side effect of her sleeping pills. Yet she has to take the sleeping pills, because oth-erwise she stays up all night thinking. In-somnia is just one side effect of her anxiety 
medication.
Yet she has to take her anxiety medication, 
because otherwise she’ll panic about the Ho-
locaust, the drugs she’s become dependent 
on, or her debilitating pain...ad nauseam.  
I’m voting yes on Amendment 2, not be-
cause marijuana is a magic pill that will cure 
all ailments.
Marijuana is a plant that can cure some 
ailments and liberate my grandmother from some of those more expensive and more dangerous drugs, which she takes as much to balance the drugs out as to balance herself 
out. 
According to the FDA, 100,000 Ameri-
cans die each year from the known side ef-
fects of prescription drugs. However, no one has ever died from a marijuana overdose. 
Enough with the “reefer madness.”
Maybe if my grandmother had a pot 
brownie, she would become more forgetful.
But having lived through hate, hunger 
and violence, maybe forgetfulness wouldn’t 
be so bad.

◗ IT’S FOLLOWING CDC TIPS.
GIUSEPPE SABELLA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville Regional Airport re-
ceives ﬂ  ights from Hartsﬁ  eld-Jackson 
Atlanta International Airport — one of ﬁ  ve airports that screens travelers from Ebola-affected countries.  
The Gainesville airport is following 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for handling the threat of Ebola, wrote Laura Aguiar, the airport’s public relations and govern-mental affairs manager, in an email.
According to the CDC, airlines can 
deny passengers with “serious conta-gious diseases” that could easily spread 
on board.
Kishor Rico, 28, frequently travels to 
play his Hare Krishna music. Rico said 
he is not concerned about the possibil-ity of contracting Ebola on his trips.
“They say that it can be transferred 
through blood, through saliva, and you can get it by eating bush meat,” Rico said. “I’m not too scared.” 
Airlines are required to recognize 
symptoms, isolate ill travelers, notify someone who can respond and give support, according to the CDC. 
Airline employees are also advised 
by the CDC to treat all bodily ﬂ  uids as infectious.
Cleaning crews are expected to use 
eye protection, waterproof gloves, sur-
gical masks and closed-toe shoes with 
covers.
Passengers receive an ill traveler 
card if they might have been exposed to someone with Ebola and are exhibit-ing symptoms. The card includes a list of what the traveler can expect during the required evaluation after the ﬂ  ight.
Harry Naegele, 60, waited to depart 
from the airport Wednesday after visit-ing for UF Homecoming. Naegele said he and and his wife, Kathy, are taking extra precautions to stay healthy.
“I have a lot of medical issues my-
self, so I’m very careful,” Naegele said. “We wash our hands more and hope for the best.”Airport prepares for EbolaNATIONAL

As sexual assault gained attention both 
nationally and locally, the Obama admin-
istration announced a new rule that would 
give students access to crime statistics in their college towns.
The Obama administration made changes 
Monday to the Jeanne Clery Act, adding a rule to help colleges keep campuses safe. The changes to the act require any college receiv-ing federal funding to keep a public crime log and release annual crime reports.
“These new rules require institutions to 
ensure that students and employees have vital information about crime on campus 
and the services and protections available to 
victims if a crime does occur, which will be signiﬁ  cant assets in addressing the growing problems of sexual assault, domestic vio-lence, dating violence and stalking on our nation’s campuses,” U.S. Secretary of Educa-tion Arne Duncan said in a U.S. Department of Education press release.
The law, set to go into effect July 1, re-quires each institution to disclose crime inci-dents that occur in one of three geographic categories: “on campus, on public property 
within or adjacent to the campus, or in non-
campus buildings or property owned or op-erated by the school,” according to the press release.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said she 
has been aware of the act’s establishment for a while and University Police has sent emails with the annual crime reports to students.
“We comply with the law,” Sikes said. 
Rania Saboungi, an 18-year-old UF micro-
biology freshman, said she appreciates get-
ting UF alerts via phone and email — other-wise she’d probably be uninformed.
“On dark nights I make sure I leave with 
my brother or leave with a male or group,” Saboungi said. 
Vanessa Diaz, a 20-year-old UF biology 
junior, said the incidents at UF have made 
her more aware of the dangers that lurk in a 
college town.
“It’s still unsettling they haven’t found the 
guy even though they are trying to make it (campus) safer,” she said.New US law aims to increase

TONIGHT AT 7.
IAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @icohenb
It was the opening round of the 2011 
NCAA tournament, and Florida and Mis-
souri were meeting for the first time in program history.
Kelly Murphy was there, not as an 
observer but as the starting setter, three years before she would earn a gold med-al with the U.S. women’s national team. Two-time All-American to-be Chloe Mann played, albeit as a sophomore with limited touches.
Then-freshman Madison Monserez 
was also at the match, although she was still learning Florida’s system and could 
only watch as her team defeated Missouri 
to advance to the next round.
But when No. 8 Florida (14-3, 8-0 
Southeastern Conference) faces Missouri (13-9, 4-3 SEC) at 7 in the O’Connell Cen-ter tonight, it won’t be like 2011.
Since the start of 2013, Missouri has 
owned the series. 
The Gators fell to the Tigers 3-1 on the 
road last year and were held scoreless in a crushing 3-0 loss at home almost a month later.
Monserez remembers it well.“The teams are so different,” she said. 
“(Missouri) is playing great, they have a lot of great players. But we both gradu-ated great players and we’re just com-pletely different teams.”
In the first meeting between Missouri 
and Florida last year, the Tigers were 23-0 and undefeated in the SEC, while UF was 18-2 with one conference loss.
So yes, the circumstances are different. 
But some factors haven’t changed.
“(Missouri) only lost two people last 
year. So it’s going to be the same outside (hitters), same middles that are going to 
challenge us in the same ways that they 
did last year,” setter Mackenzie Dagos-tino said.
Even though she wasn’t yet at UF in 
2011, Dagostino played against the Ti-gers last year and attributed both losses to Florida underestimating its opponent. The junior said they will not be making

Kelly Grassel has an advantage 
on the Florida women’s golf team 
that no one else has.
She’s the only player on the ros-
ter who’s played in The Landfall 
Tradition at the Peter Dye Course 
in Wilmington, N.C.
Grassel partici-
pated in the tour-nament as a fresh-man at Michigan State, before trans-ferring to UF. 
She finished the 
event at 15-over-par and in a tie for 41st place. With the 
experience of playing on the course 
beforehand, Grassel has been giv-
ing pointers to the team on what 
they can expect from the course.
“It’s definitely a challenge,” 
Grassel said. “The greens are pretty big and there’s lots of slope to them, 
so I think we’ll be doing some short game practice.”
The tournament in Wilmington 
will be the last one in the fall for the Gators and they’ll be facing 17 teams, including eight ranked in the top 25 in the country. South-eastern Conference foe No. 1 South 
Carolina headlines the field.
After having disappointing fin-
ishes in the first two tournaments, 
Grassel said the team is working hard in practice and on the things they can control.
“Our mindset is just staying pos-
itive and being able to do the things that we’ve been working on in prac-Grassel, UF

Coming off back-to-back losses 
is a challenge the Gators haven’t 
faced all season, but it’s what they 
are tasked with heading into to-
night’s contest against the Volun-teers.
Following two-straight losses 
in a four-day span, No. 8 Florida (11-4, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) plays host to Tennessee (7-8-1, 
2-5-1 SEC) in what has become a 
critical match for the Gators’ hopes of reclaiming the top spot in the SEC standings.
It will also be senior night for 
Florida, which will honor it’s nine graduating players in a ceremony before the game. Given those factors, the Gators 
have had all the incentive they 
need this week leading up to the game, and both the 
seniors and underclassmen say 
they’re extra motivated to move 
past the difficult weekend and get a win.“We’re all really excited, 
motivated...I think we’re all just 
gonna go in there and play hard 
for them (the seniors) and for our team,” sophomore Meggie Dough-erty Howard said.
“I definitely think it’s gonna 
be an emotional night,” said An-nie Bobbitt, one of the seniors who will be honored before the game. “The emotion’s gonna be there and I think it’s gonna drive us.”
Even with all the emotion, UF 
coach Becky Burleigh said she has no plans to give the seniors any extra playing time Friday, due to the significance of the match at this 
point in Florida’s season.
She also said the biggest obsta-
Florida faces Tennessee tonight in final home game of regular seasonGrassel
UF SoccerSee VOLLeY, PAGe 14See GOLf, PAGe 14
See SOccer, PAGe 14cle the Gators will face Friday won’t be the 
Volunteers, but rather handling the adver-sity of the two losses and responding in the 
right way.
“I think the biggest challenge is how do 
we rebound from a two-loss weekend, we 
haven’t done that all year,” she said. “That’s 
the challenge, not so much Tennessee.”
But Burleigh did say she expects the Vol-
unteers to come into Gainesville playing 
with desperation, and Florida needs to be prepared.
“I think Tennessee is really in need of a 
win, so they’re gonna be coming out as hard as possible and ready to play,” she said. “We’re expecting a tough one.”
Tennessee does need a win badly, having gone 1-3-1 in its last ﬁ  ve matches.
The Volunteers play a defensive brand of 
soccer, holding opponents to one goal per game on average, and have also amassed 17 
yellow cards on the season.
The struggle for Tennessee, though, has 
been on offense, scoring only 23 goals on the 
season.
But as Kentucky showed Sunday, a de-
fensive, physical style can give Florida prob-
lems.tice and have those carry over to the 
course,” she said.
Along with Grassel, Florida’s line-
up will include junior Ursa Orehek and freshman Taylor Tomlinson, who 
along with Grassel, competed in the 
ﬁ  rst two tournaments. 
Rounding out the lineup will be 
sophomore’s Maria Torres and Karo-lina Vlckova.
Coach Emily Glaser admits the 
team has been dealing with injuries heading into the tournament.
“We’re a little beat up to be honest, 
we’ve got a couple of girls that’ll be going that probably aren’t 100 per-cent,” Glaser said. “They’ve either had injuries, or 
kind of coming off some sickness, they haven’t had a tremendous amount of practice.”
With the last event for the fall get-
ting underway today before a three month break until the spring, Glaser wants the team to focus on what it’s 
been during the fall.
“We’ve talked so much about the 
process and I think they’re really buy-
ing into that,” Glaser said. “Of course we want to well, of course we want to win, we want to be competitive…try-ing to stay in process mode and really think about the things we can do on a daily basis and if we focus on that 
we’ll start to see the results that we’re 
looking for.”14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2014

UF midﬁ  elder Meggie Dougherty Howard (28) prepares to head a ball during Flori-
da’s 3-1 win against Missouri on Sept. 28 at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
the same mistake this year.
“I think last year, you know, they have a 
smaller outside in Carly Kan. And because 
she was so much shorter, we thought, ‘oh 
we’ve got huge blocks on the right side, we don’t have to worry about it,’” Dagos-tino said. 
“And she just balled out.”In the ﬁ  rst of two matchups between UF 
and Mizzou last year, Kan ﬁ  nished with 13 kills, 12 digs, three service aces and a .379 hitting clip.
“Maybe inch-for-inch one of the most 
amazing outside hitters in the country,” UF coach Mary Wise said of Kan.
This year, the 5-foot-9 Missouri hitter 
is averaging 3.80 points per set, just short of Florida’s Alex Holston’s 4.13 points per 
set. 
But Kan isn’t the only Mizzou player 
UF is game planning for.
“I remember that Missouri has the type 
of team and the type of players that if one 
player doesn’t have their game going, oth-ers will pick it up,” junior Gabby Mallette said. “They’re all really good, smart vol-leyball players.”
Missouri’s 6-foot-3 All-SEC middle 
blocker Whitney Little is hitting .401 this 
year, good for third in the SEC. Her team is 
in the top half of the conference in assists, kills, blocks and digs.
In addition, Missouri is coming off a 
3-2 road victory against Mississippi State, something Florida is hardly brushing over.
“When you have a tough win on the 
road, it shows a lot to your opponents,” 
Dagostino said. 
“To see them battle that hard against 
Mississippi state in ﬁ  ve (sets), it’s deﬁ  nite-
ly pushing us to work harder.”
Florida is approaching tonight’s match 
cautiously but conﬁ  dently, as they look to avoid a repeat of last year’s home blowout against the Tigers.
“We’re going to make sure we’re doing 
our part to do our part,” Dagostino said, “and not underestimating what they have on their side of the net.”Tennessee struggles on offense

Havana Solaun lost everything 
she had worked for in just two sec-
onds. All it took was a twist, a tug and a tear and everything was gone. Her season. Her opportunity to train 
with the Canadian National Soccer 
Team. And her chance to lead Flori-da to its second national title.
And there was nothing she could 
do.

Havana had only experienced 
three games in an NCAA tourna-ment. 
Coming into the 2013 season, she 
trained for the long haul – she want-ed to go far in the postseason.
But during the Southeastern Con-
ference tournament, the junior mid-fielder was brought to the ground and wouldn’t make it back onto the field for at least another year.

Havana’s mother, Sandra Brow-
er, can’t remember a time when Ha-vana wasn’t playing soccer.
Brower, who played professional 
tennis at age 23, pushed Havana to pursue the sport she knew best.
Never in her wildest dreams 
did she expect Havana to fall in love with a sport that has only ever 
been seriously popular in European 
countries.
“Havana came about soccer on 
her own,” Brower said. “She was in second grade, but she always walked around with a soccer ball in her hand. She joined a three v. three team and she literally just always walked around with a soccer ball in 
her hand, juggled, did hacky-sacks, 
just every minute she had she was doing something soccer-related.”
Her hunger for the game pushed 
her to play for every team she could. If it meant playing with the boys, then that’s what she did.
“She was 10 – maybe 11 – she 
played on a boys team,” Brower 
said. “And it was so funny because 
it was like ‘Oh my God she’s a girl. Really?’ Then they actually grew to respect her.”
Brower said she believes it’s what 
made her the player she is today: quiet, tough and precise.
At age 9, she led her team to a 
U.S. under-10 national title, a feat 
her mother thought was too much 
for a child.
“What do you look forward to 
after that?” Brower joked.
It was the fuel Havana needed.She began practicing nonstop. 
Focusing on her passing and drib-bling, putting into place the talent that has intrigued nationals teams 
like Canada and the U.S.
It’s what taught her how to pull 
defenders attention from her team-
mates to herself.
How to be unstoppable when 
shooting.
And, most importantly, how to 
find a way to win.

It was a cool Sunday after-
noon.  In Alabama, the end of No-
vember marks the beginning of winter, something Floridians don’t see until late December. The air was crisp and the wind whipped moth-ers’ hair into a matted mess.
It was the event of the weekend. 
The final game of the Southeastern Conference Tournament, and the Florida soccer team was 15 min-utes into the first half against Texas 
A&M. Florida forward Savannah 
Jordan was pushing through Texas A&M’s backline positioning herself to score, and Havana was pulling up the midfield trying to give her the ball.
It went like this for 23 minutes 
— a tug of war between Florida’s of-fense and Texas A&M’s defense.
Havana would juggle the ball and 
pass to Jordan, doing everything she could to pull defenders away from her teammate. 
She knew the team — knew 
Texas A&M didn’t have the speed to keep up with Florida’s offense — and she was more than ready to give the Aggies the final shot to the head 
that would end their season.
She danced up and down the 
field with the ball using footwork 
that would make a ballerina jealous.
Havana was leading her team.But as she turned to save a ball 
from a Texas A&M defender, she fell.
It wasn’t graceful, and it wasn’t 
soft. But it was definitely the end. The end of a great season. Of an even bigger year. And of the biggest op-
portunity she ‘d received – a chance 
to play for a national soccer team.
The result: a torn ACL.
Havana was officially out for the 
season, and even the year.

Most athletes know how to keep 
from injuring themselves. It is al-
most always in freak accidents that injuries happen. Havana’s injury was one of those.
During the summer of 2013 and 
even into the first four weeks of the soccer season, Havana trained hard.
She focused on her hamstrings 
outside of practice because the heavy quad training can make athletes more vulnerable to ACL injuries.
Once the season progressed and 
practices became more frequent, Ha-vana wore down.
The exhaustion held her back. 
Working out on her own became an afterthought. She began to focus less on strengthening and more on pre-paring for a tough SEC schedule.
“Right when I went down I kin-
da knew,” Havana said. “I mean, they always say that when you tear your ACL you just know, and unless you have, it’s kind of hard to under-
stand, but literally as I was laying on 
the field I just knew.”
When she hit the ground on 
that cold afternoon in Alabama, she pounded her fist into the grass and dirt – not from pain, but from anger.
Havana already blamed herself.“I could have prevented this,” 
was the mantra running through her 
head as she sat on the trainer’s table 
for the last 66 minutes of the match and watched her teammates fall to a Texas A&M team that they’d beat just two weeks earlier.
She wasn’t alone, though.Brower sat beside her daughter 
knowing no words in the world would be able to heal her broken 
dreams. So instead of talking, Brower 
wrapped her arms around Havana and hoped that she could somehow 
offer just a little bit of comfort.
“I think the guilt of, ‘Oh my gosh; 
I probably could have avoided this,’ was as traumatic as the injury,” 
Brower said. “My heart just broke. She had just been called up by the Canadian National Team and I knew when she went down everything was flooding through her head. At that time, nothing you say is going to make it all right.”

Coming back from an ACL tear is 
no small feat. It wrecks players.
Not just their physical abilities, 
but their psyche.“It’s not just coming back from 
a physical injury; it’s coming back from a psychological injury, too,” UF coach Becky Burleigh said.
The thing they always had, that 
they were always good at, is yanked from them and they are left to deal with the repercussions.
For many, they never make it 
back to the level they were at before it happened.
But Havana doesn’t intend for that to be the case.
“You can come back after eight 
months, but I don’t think you’re back for another year and a half,” Havana said.
By June, she was back on the soc-
cer field. Physically, she was ready to play, but mentally she was still recovering.
The 21-year-old received advice 
from her mother that would resonate with her when she stepped back on the field on Sept. 22: Don’t get back on the field until she felt she could 
walk on it without ever feeling like 
she got hurt.
“It was a long haul for her be-
cause she set goals for herself,” Brower said. “But they were gone in five seconds.”

After going into surgery on Nov. 
25, Havana made it back on the field in less than a year.
Every day is a battle, whether it’s 
mental or physical, she’s fighting to come back.
And so far, she’s been successful.In 15 games, Havana is tied for 
second on the team with four goals and second outright with five assists — it’s not as high or as profoundly strong as last season’s double scor-ing game in the season-opener against Florida Gulf Coast Universi-ty or her support in the 2012 NCAA Tournament for her senior counter-part Erika Tymrak.
But Havana’s back and she’s not 
going anywhere.
At least, not until she graduates.“Havana has really looked at it as 
building resilience,” Burleigh said. “This caused her to really dig deep and create resilience she might not have had.”

Lexx Edwards is on the 
heels of his ﬁ  rst year of actu-
ally playing with the Gators. 
The redshirt junior 
dubbed “Sexxy Lexx” by as-sistant athletic director for sports health David Werner 
practiced with the team but 
didn’t dress for any games his freshman year.
“I got it my freshman year 
and it just stuck ever since,” 
Edwards said of the nick-
name.
His sophomore year, 2012-
2013, Edwards did not com-
pete. In his redshirt sopho-
more season, 2013-2014, Edwards earned a spot on the dress roster and saw action in 11 of Florida’s 39 games. 
However, totaled just 
three rebounds in 15 minutes played. Now as he prepares for his junior season, Ed-
wards is one of the few up-
perclassmen on this year’s team.
1. What is your favorite 
movie?
“‘Glory Road’, because 
I admire how those guys fought through the adversity 
that they faced you know, 
with racism, and discrimina-tion back in those times. And they were the ﬁ  rst all-African American national champi-
onship team.”
2. What’s your favorite 
ride in Orlando?“‘Spiderman’ at Islands 
of Adventure. I’m not into 
roller coasters. I’m scared of heights but I love to ﬂ  y.”
3. What’s your favorite 
spot on campus?
“I come here. This is my fa-
vorite place, the (basketball) 
practice facility. Or me and 
the guys, we go to Chomp It and Moe’s a lot. Chicken tenders, every time, chicken tenders and fries.”
4. What’s the toughest 
class you’re taking this se-mester?
“Research methods, deﬁ  -nitely. I’m doing pretty good, just the research aspect is kind of getting to me. The system that we use, there’s 
a lot of statistics involved in 
it. So deﬁ  nitely gotta stay on top of it, can’t slack in that class.”
5. Who are your closest 
friends on the team?
“DeVon Walker, Michael 
Frazier. Jon Horford is my roommate. I’m cool with ev-
erybody. But those guys, but 
you’d probably see me with them the most. The most we probably do is we go on tri-ple-dates. We’ll go out to eat, go bowling or something, dinner and a movie.”
6. What are your personal 
goals and expectations for this season?
“Help the guys out as 
much as I can. Deﬁ  nitely just provide a good look for 
scout team and those type of 
duties. And just always mo-tivate them, encourage them, just stay on top of them when 
I feel like they’re getting be-
hind or pick them up when I feel like they’re down. Just deﬁ  nitely be that voice in their ear, just always being 
positive and helping them 
out anyway I can.”
