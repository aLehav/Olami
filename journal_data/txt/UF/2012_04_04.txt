A half hour into professor Steve Noll’s American 
History lecture, he’d already paused six times for 
waves of laughter.
Tuesday’s presentation was about the economic 
incentives behind slavery, and Noll had already im-personated an ignorant high school teacher, cracked jokes about Florida State students and made a his-torical reference to Elvis Presley . And he was just warming up.
“Class can be both entertaining and intellectu-
ally challenging,” Noll said. “If I’m just going to sit there and drone on, why should they even bother 
coming?”
His teaching methods may 
seem unorthodox, but they’re partly why Noll and two other UF professors were named among 
the 300 best professors in the U.S. by the Princeton Review.
The education services com-
pany proﬁ  led Noll, journalism professor Mike Foley and math-
ematics professor Sergei Shabanov in its new book, “The Best 300 Professors.” The list was released Tuesday.
The professors were chosen from a pool of about 
42,000 professors across the globe. UF had the most representation out of the eight Florida colleges listed. Professors were chosen for the list based on student surveys, data from RateMyProfessors.com and input from school administrators.
The book was a collaboration between The 
Princeton Review and RateMyProfessors.com, a Three UF 
professors named among best in US

Gainesville Police do not expect to 
charge a Santa Fe College student who 
shot and killed his roommate Monday night. The shooter told ofﬁ  cers he was defending himself.
Jude Rizzo, 21, killed Michael Crace, 
20, at about 11:40 p.m. at the end of the stairs in their apartment at Mill Run Con-dominiums, located off Southwest 20th Avenue. Before Rizzo started ﬁ  ring his .38-caliber revolver, Crace aimed his own pistol and threatened to kill him, Rizzo told detectives.   
Rizzo shot Crace three times, hitting 
his roommate’s chest and neck. Then, Rizzo called police.
Crace and Rizzo met about four 
months ago. They were dating women who also happened to be roommates. The two argued about property Monday, although GPD Detective Benjamin Smith would not elaborate.
Crace, Rizzo and Rizzo’s 19-year-
old brother, Joel, were living together in Apartment B at 2225 SW 39th Drive. Neighbors said they barely knew the three men and that they moved in recent-ly — Joel, who is also a Santa Fe student, ﬁ  lled out a change of address certiﬁ  cate for the Alachua County Court March 8.
GPD brought the Rizzo brothers into 
the Criminal Investigations Division for Student shooter unlikely to be charged Noll

Students may be able to satisfy early morning munchies at 
downtown food trucks if commissioners change a city law — 
a move that competing restaurants endorse.
The Gainesville City Commission will vote Thursday to 
change the hours of downtown mobile food stands, such as hot dog and taco trucks.The change will allow the stands to stay open until 3 a.m. 
The current law requires them to close at 10 p.m.
Commission protocol requires commissioners to vote on 
the ordinance at least one more time at a future meeting be-fore it goes into effect.
However, the Gainesville Police Department loosely en-
forced the on-the-books rule because keeping the trucks open past 10 p.m. hasn’t caused problems.
Most weekends, a few downtown food stands stay open until after bars close at 2 a.m., said Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa, who also serves as chairwoman of the city’s Public Safety Committee. The committee began discussing the change in September.
In fact, she said, the Public Safety Committee didn’t real-
ize city law required the vendors to close by 10 p.m. until the change was brought up.City law change may mean food stands can serve until 3 a.m.SEE SHOOTING, PAGE 4

Former Student Body Presi-
dent Ashton Charles is visiting 
UF, bringing her work to the United States as well as to The Gator Nation.
The 24-year-old UF graduate 
has been in Gainesville for the past three weeks to get feedback on Tyba, a European Internet company that allows users to build custom professional web-sites.
Charles, who was president 
from Summer 2010 to Spring 2011, led the movement to post-pone block tuition at UF.
After graduating in May 2011 
with a bachelor’s degree in politi-cal science and a master’s degree in management, she moved to Europe. 
Charles enrolled in a month-
long program at Vienna Univer -
sity of Economics and Business and then left for Spain, where she planned to teach English.
Only a day after meeting Tyba 
co-founders Eiso Kant and Philip von Have at a park in Madrid, she was offered a job with their company.Now she promotes the website 
and is working to bring it to the U.S. She said she wanted to give students the opportunity 
to showcase their accomplish-ments in a professional manner.“I did not know I would be 
lucky enough to find this com-pany,” Charles said. She has been a director for 
business development for Tyba since September.
Kant said Charles adds the 
U.S. angle that the seven-person company needed. Charles will be showing him the American uni-versity system this week.
She said she scheduled meet-
ings with administrators in dif-ferent UF colleges to discuss Tyba and catch up. 
She also presented the website 
to student organizations such as the Student Senate and the Reitz Scholars Program.
Kant said that because Tyba 
uses people’s names, it appears high in a Google search. Users can edit on the site, which starts outs free. For $3.95 a month, us-ers can create their own domain name.
He said the site currently has 
about 500 users.
Charles said her experience in 
Student Government and as as-sociate producer of communica-tions for Gator Growl has helped her tremendously.
“I use skills acquired [at UF] 
every day,” she said.

� UF SPENT $681,548 ON RESEARCH 
IN 2010.
KRISTEN MORRELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF was ranked one of the Top 25 schools for 
research spending, and a university spokes-
man said it shows the school’s prestige.
In a survey conducted by the National 
Science Foundation that looked at data from 2010, UF ranked 21st for the most money spent on research. In 2009, UF was 22nd.
The university spent $681,548 on research 
in 2010, according to the survey, which was released last month. UF was the only Florida school listed in the Top 25. The University of South Florida was 50th, the University of Miami was 74th and Florida State University was 84th.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the rank 
means students have access to faculty who are doing major research.
“This adds a great deal of value to their 
education, their experience at the university and to their long-range plans,” he said.
Rebecca Saunders, a 20-year-old food sci-
ence and human nutrition sophomore, said this shows the school’s research priorities.
“It shows that UF doesn’t just want people 
to get As in their classes,” Saunders said.UF ranks in Top 25 in nation 
for spending on researchSARAH ARRAZOLA

Gator Rater, UF’s online faculty evalu-
ations, becomes available to students this 
month.
This semester, administrators would 
like students to remember that their opin-ions about professors matter.
Although participation increased 5.9 
percent from Summer 2011 to Fall 2011, about 75 percent of UF students were not aware that student responses are used in professors’ tenure, promotion and salary decisions, according to a Gator Rater stu-dent survey.
“I’d like students to fully realize the 
value of their feedback to the educational process for current and future Gators,” UF Evaluations Coordinator Donna John-son said. “Their input each semester helps ensure continual improvement of courses here at UF.”Johnson, who taught at UF for sev-
eral years, said even when she taught 400 students in a semester, she believed their feedback was vital to improving the course.
The online evaluation system also goes 
hand-in-hand with UF’s sustainability ini-tiatives.
Gator Rater will 
save UF about $330,000 
a year, equivalent to yearly tuition and fees for about 60 under -
graduate students, ac-cording to information 
from the UF Office of Institutional Plan-ning and Research.
Evaluations are already open for some 
classes at www.evaluations.ufl.edu, and others will open later this month. Results from last semester are also available. Eval-uations close on the last day of the class.Evaluations open this month
Johnson 
website through which students publicly grade the quality of their 
professors. Noll, Foley and Shabanov each have an “Overall Qual-ity” rating of more than 90 percent on the website.
“He’s what you want in a professor,” said Kelly Vidal, a 19-year-
old history and political science major in Noll’s class. “Even in a two-hour period, he always keeps everyone’s attention.”
Noll said he encourages his students to take what they learn in 
class and use that information to challenge their own beliefs. He also wants them to question his teaching.
For Foley , entertaining his Reporting students isn’t just part of 
his job, it’s a lifestyle. He’s been known to dance from one side of his lecture hall to the other to get a lethargic class’s attention.
Foley’s class may be fun, but it’s also serious. His easiness score 
on RateMyProfessors.com is 50 percent.
He said he’s had students write him, “Thank you for kicking 
my ass.”
For professors hoping to be included in the next volume of the 
publication, Foley’s advice was simple.
“I think it helps if you’re funny ,” he said. “It’s like sugar with 
medicine. You can get the facts down if you can throw a joke in there.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2012

Police and downtown restaurants comfortable with proposed changes
“Police were comfortable with the food trucks staying 
open,” Mastrodicasa said. “They are comfortable with the 
change.”
Some downtown restaurant managers and bartenders 
think the new hours of operation could jump-start a food cart revolution in Gainesville and lead to a more vibrant down-town culture.
Warren Oakes, owner and manager of Boca Fiesta, a downtown Mexican restaurant, said he hopes the new hours will motivate more people to open food stands in the area.
He said he might even open one for Boca Fiesta.Big Lou’s Pizzeria also serves food until 3 a.m., but only on 
Fridays and Saturdays.Assistant Manager Jordan Pfeiffer said she is not worried 
about late-night food vendors affecting business. Instead, she said, she hopes to work with them to keep the downtown economy running smoothly.
A downtown bartender for 30 years, Tom Blake said al-
lowing food stands to stay open late would distract rowdy students from fighting on the streets after the bars close.
“Now they have a chili dog to focus on instead of getting 
into trouble,” said Blake, a bartender at Lillian’s Music Store.

Crace worked at Moe’s, as production technician for UF Performing Arts
questioning after the shooting, and they were 
released Tuesday morning. Jude was not charged, and there were no other witnesses at the scene.
“We’re looking at it as a self-defense case,” 
Smith said.Before making a final decision about wheth-
er Jude will be charged, GPD will wait for fo-rensic evidence to come back. Such evidence could show from where the bullets were shot and from what angle, among other things.
According to his Facebook, Crace had 
worked at Moe’s Southwest Grill since August. He also worked as a production technician for UF Performing Arts from 2008 to 2010.Friends and family typed messages on 
Crace’s Facebook wall Tuesday, many shar -
ing memories of growing up with him. Kim-berly Rachael Barry , who is listed as a sister on Crace’s Facebook page, wrote she wanted to talk to him again: “ ... all the times I thought about texting you, I wish I really did.”
Matthew Trenary, another Facebook friend, 
expressed doubt about the official version of Monday night’s events, pointing out that all the details are coming from Jude and Joel.
Crace’s criminal history in Alachua County 
is limited to a sworn complaint for marijuana possession in February.
Neither Joel nor Jude returned calls from 
the Alligator seeking comment Tuesday night.

A Sweet-16 celebration will hit 
the downtown plaza today , but 
this one will have more vegetables than cake.
The Union Street Farmers Mar -
ket will celebrate its 16th anniver -
sary from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. today at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza, 111 E University Ave.
Established in 1996, Union 
Street Farmers Market started out with about eight farmers who met once a week at Sun Central Plaza to sell goods.
Charlie Lybrand, director of Union Street Farmers Market, said the market now has about 55 ven-dors a week.
The celebration will have a 
cooking demonstration by Ste-fanie Samara Hamblen, owner of Hogtown HomeGrown and The Illegal Jam Company.
Hamblen’s will offer tips on 
how to eat more vegetables, and she will give out free samples of sweet potato curry , BBQ tofu with onions and smoky Southern field peas.
Hamblen said she has been 
shopping at Union Street Farmers Market for about 12 years.  
Lybrand said they wanted the 
market to be more expressive of the community.
“We have so much talent in 
this community ,” he said. “We’re a reflection of something really unique.”Farmers market to

Student Senate President Aundre Price said at 
Tuesday’s meeting that his goal for Senate is to 
reach out to and improve communication with the UF Student Body.
He presented his legislative agenda, co-au-
thored by Senate President pro tempore Logan Harrison, to about 80 senators at the meeting.
After the meeting, Price said he wants to ac-
complish close to 100 percent of the items he put forth on his agenda.
“I do have the entire summer,” he said.Some of the items outlined in his agenda are pre-
senting upcoming bills in the Gator Times for stu-dents, recruiting students to help freshmen move into dorms, spending a day at Lake Wauburg with freshmen and hosting more town hall meetings.
Price also touched on academics, aiming to im-
prove and increase funding for the Broward Teach-ing Center and create a medical school recreation room.
After the meeting, Price said these ideas might 
take longer than his term, which will end with the fall elections.
He also said he discussed getting students in-
volved in UF’s anti-hazing task force subcom-mittees with Interim Vice President for Student Affairs Dave Kratzer and Associate Provost of Un-dergraduate Affairs Bernard Mair. Senators could serve on subcommittees such as institutional and statewide; band, ROTC and athletics; and student organizations.
Price wrote in an email that the subcommittees 
will review the hazing policies and regulations of each area.
After the agenda presentation, senators unani-
mously passed a bill to express condolences for the death of Trayvon Martin. Last week, senators asked the bill’s authors to revise it. The authors took out “white and Latino” to describe George 
Zimmerman, who says he shot Trayvon in self-defense.  
Some senators were confused 
as to why Zimmerman’s race 
was removed when the bill still states that Trayvon was African-American.
Sen. Christina Bonarrigo said 
Travyon’s description remained for biographical purposes. His 
background and interests are also in the bill, she said.
The bill was passed with an amendment to send 
it to Trayvon’s parents.
The Senate also unanimously approved the 
2012-13 Student Government Funded Academic Budget. Senators will likely vote on the student organizations budget next week.

Government regulation should be curtailed
This past week, the Supreme Court listened to testi-
monies to judge the constitutionality of nationalized health care, or “Obamacare,” the moniker given by 
its right-wing opposition.
Such proceedings — a room full of lawyers debating the 
wording of a 2,700-page document, which will go unread by most of the congressmen who voted on it (but you can hardly blame them) — bring out the worst in our current legislative climate. One is reminded of Winston Churchill’s thoughtful quote, “If you have 10,000 regulations, you lose all respect for the law.”
It is odd to think that our Constitution, the most erudite 
formulation of laws ever assembled by mankind, is small enough to fit in one’s pocket, yet this leviathan piece of le-gal craftsmanship couldn’t even fit in a briefcase. The health care code is an indiscernible mess, written by lawyers to be understood by lawyers.
Such foppish elitism can make one pine for Savannah, 
Ga., in 1734, when all lawyers were banned from the city to be free from, as James Oglethorpe called them, “the pest and scourge of mankind.”
Is it truly healthy for a nation to have any code of law 
that cannot be understood by the common man?
As the years pass and our bills and regulations get lon-
ger and longer, one cannot help but think that we have departed from the system of common law forged by our ancestors and rather embraced Napoleonic law — a system of government that descends from the rulers to the masses, rather than the other way around.
Everywhere we look, there is evidence of intensive gov-
ernment regulation. Our soda cans display every ingredi-ent known to man (most of them unpronounceable), oc-cupancy limits are plastered in every auditorium and we cannot even travel by airplane without the risk that an er -
rant piece of metal will give reason for us to be stripped and humiliated before a slack-jawed band of uniform-wearing ingrates.Is this the freedom our fathers 
envisioned? If it is, we might as well begin quartering redcoats in our dorm rooms.
Some regulations, to be sure, 
are reasonable — I wouldn’t want to drive on a highway with-out speed limits. But even that proves that the best regulations are those than can be understood 
by everyone. You don’t need a law degree to know that if your speedometer says 90 when you pass a sign that says 60, you need to slow down.
Yet most regulations are not only unnecessary, but also 
condescending in a way that would make Napoleon proud. Do we really need a list of ingredients on a can of Moun-tain Dew to know it’s bad for us? And do we truly need a taxpayer-supported government employee to inform us when a room is crowded?
Our government seems to think that without its rules and 
regulations descending from on high, we would devolve to the Victorian era of sweatshops and chimney sweeps.
There is a practical way to limit government intrusion 
and return us to the era of common law. Ironically, it re-quires a new law, but it would be worth it: “No law or regulation, at the State or Federal level, can be longer than the Constitution” (our 10 finest laws were no more than a sentence each, but one cannot expect mankind to have the succinct wisdom of the Almighty).
No longer would every legislator need a law degree to 
understand what they vote for and neither would the aver -
age citizen. We would live more freely, and our government would rule more justly. Such a law is unlikely to be passed, for it would end the current bacchanalian legislative orgy, but we, as citizens, could make it an issue to fight for.

Trolling is free 
speech, too
Have you ever been annoyed by something that someone 
posted on your Facebook wall?
Have you ever seen anyone using profanity in a 
Twitter post?
In some states, new laws might make these actions illegal un-
der the guise of combating cyberbullying.
They will also likely create a legal nightmare if they become 
law and are enforced.
A bill making its way through the Alabama State Legislature, 
according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, or FIRE, would criminalize “transmitting, posting, displaying or disseminating, through electronic communications ‘with the in-tent to harass, annoy or alarm.’”
The Arizona legislature passed a bill Tuesday that “could 
send people who ‘annoy or offend’ to jail for up to six months,” according to ABC News. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has yet to sign the bill into law.
While the desire to curb cyberbullying is noble, going after 
speech on the Internet could have some negative, unintended consequences.
Neither bill explains what it means to “annoy” or “offend,” a 
vagueness that makes almost anything that occurs on the Inter -
net subject to criminal charges.
According to FIRE, if the Alabama bill becomes law, “it 
would be a Class A misdemeanor to send an email to classmates lampooning Canadians for their usage of the word ‘eh’ or their inexplicable love of ice hockey if that email has the effect of sub-stantially embarrassing or humiliating a Canadian student in the eyes of his fellow university classmates.”
The Arizona law also suffers from the same level of troubling 
vagueness.
In a letter to the governor of Arizona, the activist group Me-
dia Coalition argued that the bill “is not limited to a one-to-one conversation between two specific people. The communication does not need to be repetitive or even unwanted. There is no requirement that the recipient or subject of the speech actually feel offended, annoyed or scared.”
Instead, the language of the bill implies that the state can go 
after any electronic communication that it finds annoying or of-fensive.
The letter continues by arguing that the bill does not “make 
clear that the communication must be intended to offend or an-noy the reader, the subject or even any specific person.”
According to the Media Coalition’s interpretation of the bill, 
even if you post something online that was not meant to offend or annoy , the state could still potentially pursue criminal charges against you if someone somewhere finds your post annoying or offensive.
Not only do these pieces of legislation completely squelch 
free speech on the Internet, they serve as perfect examples of well-intended laws with unintentional consequences.

opinions@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 7
I would like to address some of the 
comments made by Chip Skambis in his recent column entitled, “Cheat-
ing is the sign of a flawed system.”
Skambis claims from the outset that 
he is not “in favor of lies, deceit and dis-honesty,” and yet the remainder of his column seems to me a (weak) justifica-tion of those exact actions.
Essentially, his argument boils down 
to the following: Professors sometimes make mistakes when they devise test questions and essay topics. Therefore, to right the wrongs of this (occasional-ly) unjust academic world, students can resort to cheating — “the only way for [them] to empower themselves” with-out “watch[ing] their grades go down.”
For the record, other options for not 
watching your grade go down in those situations (without cheating) include going to your professor’s office hours to discuss what you find to be “overly broad” essay topics or asking your pro-fessor for clarification in class or via email.
Call me an optimist, but I think most 
of the time you’ll find that professors go out of their ways to make sure their ex-pectations are clear and their test ques-tions are fair.
Of course, that’s not to say that all 
professors will be helpful in such situ-ations. 
Sometimes, professors will write 
vague or unfair test questions and es-say topics and then not clarify when ap-proached for further explanation.
In other news, life is not fair.This may not be much consolation, 
but in these academically unjust situ-ations, your fellow classmates are also struggling with the same profes-sor and his/her supposed un-fairness.
If you resort 
to cheating as a way to right this injus-tice at the micro-level, what you are re-ally doing is punishing the students in the class who do not resort to cheating. Employers may hire you, and gradu-ate schools may accept you over other more competent students because when faced with adversity, you cheated your way to a higher grade in class.
Is this type of cheating “empower -
ing” as Skambis suggests, or is it simply a way of pushing a professor’s unfair -
ness back on fellow classmates?
When professors are unjust, confront 
them about it directly and diplomati-cally.
If they don’t give in, contrary to what 
Skambis claims, you have a number of ways to “empower yourself.” First, you can drop their class. This gives an incen-tive to your professors to act more ju-diciously because if their class sizes are significantly diminished, it’s less likely they’ll get to teach that class again. Sec-ond, you can vent your frustrations in the end-of-semester evaluations. Lastly, you can write a letter to their depart-ment chair and let them know how you feel about the professors.
By channeling your frustrations con-
structively, you can help hold unfair professors unaccountable without re-sorting to plagiarism or other academic dishonesty.

Speaking OutSometimes those who are assumed to be 
the most truthful — clergymen and other religious figures — end up being the most 
disingenuous.
Indeed, it seemed like the Vatican was ready 
for open discussion and possibly enlightenment when the Pontifical Academy for Life planned the Responsible Stem Cell Research Congress for April 25 to April 28.
The event was to be attended by stem cell 
researchers from around the world, many of whose work involves the use of human embry-onic stem cells, which makes them sinners in the eyes of the Vatican.
But at the end of March, the Vatican canceled 
the event. A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, blamed “organizational, logistical and economic factors” for the cancellation.
After examining the controversy surround-
ing the conference, however, it seems there was more to the cancellation than the Vatican is let-ting on.
The Catholic News Agency reported that an 
anonymous member of the Pontifical Academy for Life called the cancellation an “enormous relief to many members of the Pontifical Acad-emy for Life, who felt that the presence on its program of so many speakers, including the keynote speaker, committed to embryonic stem cell research, was a betrayal of the mission of the Academy and a public scandal.”
It turns out that enlightenment was not what 
the Vatican wanted after all. In fact, the Vatican actually held similar conferences the past two years, but this one was different in that some of the most prominent embryonic stem-cell re-searchers in the world were to attend, and they were not going to tame their speeches to ap-pease their audience.
After the cancellation, Alan Trounson, presi-
dent of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine in San Francisco and one of the invit-ed researchers, said, “I think the only interpre-tation is that we are being censored. It is very disappointing that they are unwilling to hear the truth.”
When the Vati-
can hosts events like these, it’s not be-cause it wants to be enlightened or give researchers a fair hearing. The Vatican 
clearly hosted this event to assert its own ideas and to align public perception of stem cell re-search with its own perception.
And when the Vatican is being disingenu-
ous about its motives for hosting such events, it’s no wonder why scientist Paul Knoepfler, an associate professor of Cell Biology and Human Anatomy at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine, said, “I personally am very uncomfortable with a scientific meeting run by a church and one at which only certain types of science and scientists are allowed to attend.”
Although the Catholic Church doesn’t have 
the best track record with science — might we remember the infamous affair with Galileo, who was deemed a heretic for supporting the theory that the solar system centered around the sun — the Catholic Church is not histori-cally anti-scientific.
In fact, the Catholic Church has given a lot 
to science, from Jesuit scientists to historical support and contemporary funding of scien-tific research.
But when it comes to modern biological re-
search, the Vatican must know that it is not the bioethics headquarters of the world. Scientists are always willing and ready for discussion.
Once the Vatican is also ready and willing 
for open dialogue, it will have the opportunity to learn a lot from the researchers they call sin-ners and bridge the manufactured gap between religion and science.

opinions@alligator.org� THE PANELS WILL REDUCE 
BETA’S ELECTRICITY BILL BY 20 PERCENT.
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Writer
The roof of UF’s Beta Theta Pi fra-
ternity house isn’t littered with red 
cups, beer bottles or pizza boxes. In-stead, it’s covered with solar panels.
The Gamma Xi chapter of Beta 
installed a $44,000 solar array last week. The 10-kilowatt system is the first on a Greek house at UF, said Brian Brasington, president of the chapter’s housing corporation.
Sustainability studies junior Stu-
art Block, 20, was the brain behind the venture.
Block approached the fraternity’s 
housing executives with a solar pan-el proposal in November.
“I just thought if people could 
see solar panels on our house that they would realize, ‘We can defi-nitely contribute to the sustainability movement,’” Block said.
After getting the go-ahead from 
Brasington and talking with UF’s Office of Sustainability, Block dis-covered Power Production Manage-ment Inc., a Gainesville energy-solu-tions business.
The company helped the frater -
nity apply for and receive a $22,000 rebate from Progress Energy for the project, he said. UF loaned Beta $10,000 through an education fund.
Fraternity brothers will work 
off the loan over the next five years through energy-related UF commu-nity service.
Power Product Management 
workers installed the 42 panels last week, and they’ll be turned on with-in two weeks, Block said.
Each panel has the energy po-
tential of 245 watts. The system will reduce the fraternity’s electric bill by about 20 percent, Block said.
The fraternity should recoup the 
expenses in about six years’ time.
Block said he hopes solar panel 
systems will spread throughout UF. First, he’s got to face one more chal-lenge: keeping Beta brothers away from the panels.
“I’ll have to get people to refrain 
from throwing things onto the roof,” he joked.

� UF FELL TO UNRANKED UNF, 
10-5, IN THE TEAM’S FIRST MID-WEEK LOSS THIS SEASON. 
BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
 
JACKSONVILLE — Kevin O’Sullivan 
could do nothing but shake his head and 
shrug his shoulders as he looked around at an emptying Harmon Stadium. 
Hitters who had been strong all year 
hadn’t hit, formerly solid pitchers had given up runs in six consecutive innings and the Gators had dropped their first midweek game of the year. 
The opponent was North Florida — a 
team Florida is surprisingly now 5-5 all-time against. 
“This was a bad night,” O’Sullivan 
said. “You have nights where you just play terrible, and we played terrible.”
In front of the second-largest crowd 
(2,144) in UNF history, No. 1 Florida (24-5) fell to North Florida (18-13) 10-5. The surroundings were harsh and homely in comparison to recent trips to pristine Southeastern Conference parks during an eight-game road trip, but the play on the field was even uglier.
The Gators needed eight pitchers to 
navigate through the game, struggling to throw strikes but also facing defen-sive woes when the ball was put in play. Austin Maddox committed two errors to add to an 0-for-4 night at the plate in his fourth start at first base of the sea-son. Preston Tucker had a fielding error of his own tacked on to a 1-for-4 show-ing, his lone hit an RBI single in the fifth inning.
“We obviously needed some better 
performances from some of our guys,” senior center fielder Daniel Pigott said. “We came out and we just didn’t do what we needed to do.” 
Florida’s bullpen became a black 
hole, dragging out the game by walking four and throwing 145 pitches in seven innings. Four pitchers (Bobby Poyner, Daniel Gibson, Corey Stump and Ryan Harris) failed to last an entire inning, with all except Harris being charged with an earned run. Poyner gave up four hits and three earned runs in the second without recording an out. 
“We couldn’t throw fastballs for 
strikes,” O’Sullivan said. “We weren’t even trying to go to the corners. We nib-bled and unfortunately North Florida made us pay for it.”
The Ospreys got a brief taste of what 
the Gators pitching staff can be when 
sophomore right-hander Karsten Whit-son returned to the mound for the first time since Feb. 26. In what he called a “re-
hab start” after recov-ering from a groin in-jury and arm fatigue, 
Whitson told O’Sullivan he would need seven pitches to finish his planned one inning of work. He used eight. 
“My command was good, my slider 
was good, so it was very promising to see,” Whitson said. “Hopefully this weekend I’ll start (against LSU).” 
North Florida hitters had no answer 
for his slider, striking out twice after a leadoff grounder to shortstop. 
“That was the bright moment of the 
night for us,” O’Sullivan said. 
Unfortunately for the Gators, it was 
the lone bright spot. After going up 1-0 in the first with no outs, Florida strand-ed two runners on first and third. The frustrating trend carried throughout the game, as UF recorded 10 hits but left nine runners on base. 
“As far as moving on, it has to hap-
pen right now,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s the worst game we’ve played all year, quite frankly, coupled with a well-played game by North Florida. Obviously the result indicated both of those things.” Top-ranked Florida ends road trip with ‘worst game all year’
End Of grEgulatiOn
Over the past few seasons, Florida’s spring practice 
system has given rise to a recurring phenomenon. I call it the “Guy to look out for but not really be-
cause he’s probably never going to do anything anyway” syndrome. We’re still working on the name. 
It happens because spring is a time when all of our 
knowledge is based on quotes and hearsay, leading to oc-casional bits of misinformation. 
Every year, one or two guys reportedly shoot up the 
depth chart, impressing coaches and players and inspir -
ing irrational hope for the fall. In 2009, it was center Sam Robey.Robey did not play a single 
down during his freshman season before getting rave reviews the following spring. There was even talk that Maurkice Pouncey would move to guard to make room for Robey. NFL Pro Bowl center Maur -
kice Pouncey… switch positions… for Robey. 
“He’s really come on,” coach Urban Meyer said. “He 
might be among the first five.”
Robey played a few snaps in the fall and then slid back into obscurity. He’s actually still on the roster, believe it or not. 
Last year, it was wideout Quinton Dunbar, who missed 
his entire freshman season with an injury before rising from seventh on the depth chart into the starting lineup during the spring. Frankie Hammond said he was the most eye-opening player in spring practices.  
During the fall, Dunbar totaled four catches for 34 
yards in seven Southeastern Conference games. 
With that in mind, I’ve been on the lookout for the next Fostering fake phenoms one of UF’s favorite spring pastimes

Demps wins award
After posting the nation’s fastest all-conditions time (10.01) in the 100m 
during last week’s meet, senior Jeff Demps was announced Tuesday as the recipient of the SEC’s Co-Men’s Runner of the Week award.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2012
Robey/Dunbar. 
Remember, this player has to come from 
nothing, rise to prominence in spring, and 
then go back to nothing before making any tangible impact. 
So Ronald Powell, who has been named 
defensive player of the day in both scrim-mages, and by all other measures would be a viable candidate, is ineligible. Being the No. 1 overall recruit put too big of a spotlight on him from the get-go. We’re looking for true obscurity. 
Even Dunbar isn’t up for reelection, be-
cause being the subject of all that spring hype put him in the public eye. With that in mind, here are some guys 
to be wary of… 
Jaylen Watkins, junior cornerback:  
As the team’s ninth-leading tackler last year, Watkins was a little too important to be a true candidate. Still, reports say he’s improved his physicality and play-making, with Will Muschamp saying he’s done “some nice things” and Hammond calling him the hardest DB to go against. Hammond’s praise was the death knell for Dunbar. Will Frankie strike again?
Loucheiz Purifoy, sophomore cor -
nerback: Purifoy was pretty much a spe-
cial-teams-only guy last year, but his im-provement has impressed Watkins, and Muschamp said he’s done “some nice things,” and Dan Quinn said he is a candi-date to start opposite Marcus Roberson.
Omarius Hines, senior running back 
(I guess?): Hines, Mike Gillislee, Omar Hunter and Jon Harrison have all praised Hines’ move to the backfield. Even Mus-champ said he’s done “some nice things.” But he’s barely ever played running back before and touched the ball eight times last season. So good luck with that. 
Antonio Morrison, four-star freshman 
linebacker: Quinn is impressed with his physicality, Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins have both raved about him, and Mus-champ said he’s done some “good things.” Even though that might actually be better than “nice things,” don’t get too excited. Morrison will be trapped behind Bostic, Jenkins and Michael Taylor on the depth chart all season. He’s the early favorite to win these honors next spring.
Latroy Pittman, freshman four-star 
wide receiver: We have a winner! Al-though I’ve never seen him play, he has all the makings of Dunbar 2.0. But because he’s a more physical, blocking wide re-ceiver, nobody is making the comparison. Pittman caught a touchdown in the first scrimmage and was the player of the day Saturday, prompting Muschamp to say that he’s done “some nice things” and is moving up the depth chart. But he’s still never played a down, and we’d be crazy to make the same mistake twice, regard-less of how many “nice things” he does in the spring.

GREG , from page 13PREVIEWING THE ORANGE AND BLUE DEBUT
With the Gators’ annual spring game, the Orange and Blue Debut, scheduled for this Saturday, we at alligatorSports want to get you prepared. Each day this week, we will 
give you a new piece from three separate top-ﬁ  ve lists: something to look for during the spring game, an area the team must improve upon in 2012 and a major storyline to 
follow as the spring season comes to a close. Today, we look at the running backs, the pass rush and that dreaded s-word — soft.
� SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR DURING SATURDAY’S GAME:
        3. The play of the running backs
While getting a good grasp on what Florida’s overall 
offense will look like in the fall might be tough to garner in one spring game, the scrimmage should give a glimpse at the Gators’ depth at running back. Florida is in the midst a departure from last year’s speed-ﬁ  rst approach with seniors Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps to 
more of a power-based running game in offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s ﬁ  rst season. Needless to say, there could be some new wrinkles and de-viations to where and how the running backs are used in their formations. 
Coach Will Muschamp said this 
week that senior Mike Gillislee is the likely starter heading into the sea-
son, so don’t expect him to be carrying a large load in the game. Instead, watch for 5-foot-11, 210-pound sophomore Mack Brown to get extra touches as well as some of the Gators’ recent converts to tailback. Former tight end Omarius Hines and Chris “Juice” Johnson, who played linebacker last season, will both need to make positive impressions in the spring game if they want to keep their position switches permanent. Also, keep an eye on how Pease uses fullbacks Trey Burton and Hunter Joyer. As a freshman, Joyer might have been Florida’s best option as a short- yardage back despite his limited carries.� AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
                       3. Pass rush
When Ronald Powell, Sharrif Floyd and Dominique Eas-ley sat onstage at media day before the 2010 season, proclaiming themselves the football version of the Mi-ami Heat’s Big 3, fans and media alike ate it up. Three top-10 overall recruits would solidify Florida’s defensive line for years to come, imposing fears on opposing 
quarterbacks. But that hasn’t hap-pened. Floyd has been forced to play outside at end because of depth issues, Easley has shown ﬂ  ashes but hasn’t yet developed into an every-down force and Powell has been anything but the dominant pass-rushing end everyone expected from the nation’s top recruit. 
The Gators ﬁ  nished in the middle of the pack in the Southeastern Conference last season with 28 sacks, but they never consistently pressured the quarterback and opponents never had to gameplan for their pass rush. Muschamp and Dan Quinn have both spoke about the need for improvement in that area this sea-son, and it starts with Powell, Easley and Floyd taking the next step in their development. Although the Gators have several pass-rushing prospects enrolling in August, incoming freshmen, even highly touted ones like top-10 overall recruit Jonathan Bullard, rarely make an impact 
their ﬁ  rst year. Just ask “The Big 3.”

� STORYLINE TO WATCH:
    3. Developing toughness
After the Gators ended the 2011 regular season 
with their sixth loss, which came at the hands of the rival Seminoles in an ugly game featuring ﬁ  ve turnovers, Muschamp exploded in his postgame interview. He called his players soft, said they couldn’t run the football and pointed out that they 
lacked the ability to control the line of scrimmage. It was an all-out assault designed to inspire change. Challenging the Gators to grow up mentally and physically was Mus-champ’s best coaching move to date. Anyone could see that Florida was pushed around last season, bullied even. The offensive line has 
taken the brunt of the criticism, and for good reason. At times, the play up front resembled the turnstiles fans enter through at most stadiums. Alabama and LSU, and even South Carolina, controlled the line of scrimmage in dominant wins last year. So did Geor-gia, which held UF to negative rushing yards — some-thing that was unheard of under Urban Meyer. With equal furor as his postgame speech last November, Muschamp has continued to levy the “soft” label as motivation this spring. And, according to him, there has been progress. But will that progress translate 
onto the ﬁ  eld come September? Gator Nation will 
be watching.

Shawn Janetzke / Alligator Staff�UF HAS NOT HAD MORE 
THAN THREE CARDS IN LAST 12 GAMES. 
JOSH JURNOVOY

The Gators’ defenders were 
tired.
They were having to run more  
than usual to account for the free 
attacker that resulted from being down a defender.
After Florida received six yel-
low cards in its 14-5 win against Jacksonville on Feb. 15, the defense decided to make sure it would not be shorthanded that many times again.
“I don’t think it was anything we 
said,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “It was our defense sitting down with our offense and really just lay-ing down the law.”
Since the Jacksonville game, No. 
4 Florida (12-2, 2-0 American La-crosse Conference) has been able to limit reckless plays that put the team a player down for two min-utes at a time.
The defenders wanted to make 
sure the midfielders and attackers were making an effort to not place an unnecessary burden on them.
“At a practice, the defenders 
came up and talked to us about it,” junior midfielder Brittany Dashiell said. “They were like, ‘We can’t get any yellow cards. It’s hard to play man-down defense. Just try your best not to swing and hold your body on redefending.’”
Both the offensive and defensive 
players have cleaned up their play since, and the Gators have not had more than three yellow cards in any of their last 12 games and did not have a single card in three of them. 
O’Leary said that all of the play-
ers have done a better job of not swinging wildly and staying in front of attackers.
“It’s making a conscious effort 
to play within the rules,” O’Leary said. “We need to control ourselves and play better defense inside (the 8-meter arc) and in transition as well.”
Dashiell also said the defenders 
remind the offense during games to not get overly aggressive.
“If we get a yellow card, they’ll 
start screaming, ‘Stop swinging,’” Dashiell said. “At halftime, they’ll say it again.”
To make the players more aware 
of any action on the field that could result in a yellow card, the coaches have called more fouls in practice. The coaches also call out when a play could be a yellow card even if they don’t blow the whistle. Junior defender Sam Farrell said the tight-ly called practices have been a good way to reinforce proper technique to the defenders and discourage wildly swinging their sticks.
“That’s the main thing — just 
not swinging,” Farrell said. “When you’re going to double or when you’re playing on someone some-times it’s just so tempting to swing, but in this level everyone is really good at protecting their stick so we’re just going to get a foul.”
O’Leary said it comes down to the players not making dumb deci-sions, and the Gators are getting the message.“I think that’s been the key to our 
games lately,” junior attacker Ash-ley Bruns said. “To just be smart.”WEDNESDAY, APRIL 4, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Although the Gators and Seminoles rivalry has proved con-
tentious on the football field, the matchup between the foul 
lines has proved to be just as competitive.
UF is 15-13 overall against their in-state rival. With No. 6 
Florida (31-4) riding an eight-game winning streak against No. 21 Florida State (33-6), there won’t be a lack of hatred today at 6 p.m. in Tallahassee.
The Gators have faced the Seminoles three times in the past 
two years, winning every time.
“We hate FSU,” Kelsey Horton said. “I know some people 
that play for them and right before the game, we’re smiling and waving but once it starts we want to kill them. And as soon as it’s over, we’re smiling and waving again. But this game is very important to us, it is a big rivalry.”
Florida has come out on top for the last five years against 
its Atlantic Coast Conference foe. And extending that success against Florida State is especially important with UF losing to South Florida on March 28.
The team’s self-proclaimed vocal leader, sophomore Chey-
enne Coyle, still feels the sting of the last couple losses and wants to redeem those with a win on Wednesday.
“We’re all excited to get a midweek game against FSU, espe-
cially after last week’s loss,” Coyle said. “We want to show we can get a midweek win. And of course, it’s FSU. So anytime we play FSU, I think there’s going to be that rivalry there.”
This year, the annual matchup returns to the state capital 
where the Gators are an even 7-7. And with seven fresh faces on coach Tim Walton’s squad this year, a trip to JoAnne Graf Field will be a eye-opening experience. 
With UF in town, the Seminoles drew a school-record 933 
fans in their 1000-seat stadium on April 14, 2010. 
“They are a rowdy crowd,” Coyle said. “And they are in-
state so a lot of people will go. ... Playing on the road has helped us so far for preparing us for FSU, since a lot of our players haven’t seen it before.”
One of those players, freshman Lauren Haeger, picked up 
the loss in last week’s matchup against USF. But she came back on Saturday against Georgia to grab her 10th victory of the sea-son in the circle. Whether or not she is pitching, Haeger is eager to leave behind her the losing mindset and move on to helping her team climb up in the win column.
“I’ve always heard a lot about Florida State,” Haeger said. 
“They are very aggressive and they don’t care who you are. We’re not going to take anyone lightly, if they are conference or not. So you have to really focus and do what you are there to do.”Florida-Florida State rivalry hits the diamond today in Tallahassee

As a track and field athlete, one typically 
competes as a runner, jumper or thrower. 
Sophomore Brittany Harrell does all three. 
During the outdoor season, the multi-
event athlete’s main focus is the heptathlon. The heptathlon involves seven events —  long 
jump, javelin throw, 800m, 100m hurdles, high jump, shot put and 200m — that are spread out over the two days.
“It’s very challenging at times, but I need 
to have a strong mindset and just be willing to give every ounce of energy that I have in those two days,” Harrell said.
Being a multi-event athlete is nothing new to 
Harrell. As a senior in high school, Harrell won the Mississippi Class 5A State title in the 100m hurdles, 300m hurdles, high jump, 4x400m, 4x800m and 4x1,600m. She also competed in the heptathlon at the Junior Olympics.
“Now it’s just natural for me,” Harrell said. 
“I’ve always been a hard worker, so it just came easy to me.”
Harrell really shines in competitions with 
her second-day performances. While the other women start to lose energy, Harrell is just hit-ting her stride.
Harrell was able to move up from fourth 
place to second at the Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays last weekend because of her two top-
five finishes in the long jump and javelin throw on the second day of competi-tion. Every meet that Harrell has been entered in the hep-tathlon, she has improved her standing on the second 
day of competition. 
“By the second day , I’m 
going off of adrenaline, so I 
won’t really feel anything until that night and everything just hits me,” Harrell said. 
“It usually takes me a good two days to get 
over it.”Despite all the hard work Harrell puts into 
practicing all seven events, she wouldn’t trade it for just focusing on one.
“When I do all of those events, I know that 
everybody can’t do it, so it’s a challenge to me and gives me that extra edge and that extra boost of energy,” Harrell said.
As the Gators host this weekend’s meet, 
the Pepsi Florida Relays, Harrell will be com-peting in the 100m hurdle and javelin to help improve her score for her next competition in the heptathlon.
“This weekend, I’m focusing on getting 
better with my teammates and working on my hurdles and javelin,” Harrell said. “It’ll be easier when I get in the multi because of the higher competition this weekend with regular hurdlers and javelin throwers.”
