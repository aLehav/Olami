Christian Aguilar spent less 
than two semesters at UF, but 
he left an impact on Gainesville forever.
Students ﬁ  rst heard of the 
18-year-old freshman when he was reported missing Sept. 20. His parents drove up from Mi-ami that weekend, launching a nearly monthlong search with hundreds of volunteers — ﬁ  rst looking for Christian injured but alive and then hoping to recover his body.
About 14,000 Facebook us-
ers joined a group to coordinate volunteer efforts; an Indiegogo campaign raised more than $12,000; and national media out-lets picked up the story , working to get Christian’s name out to the public.
To CNN, he was Christian 
Aguilar, the missing college stu-dent in Florida. To UF students, he was a name and face on miss-ing posters all over campus.
But to his best friend, he was just Chris.
A simple case of assigned 
seating in a physical education class brought Christian Aguilar 
and Sebastian Arias together for 
the ﬁ  rst time in 2005.
Seven years later, upon grad-
uating from high school, the two took different paths. Christian went to UF for biomedical en-gineering while Arias stayed in Miami to study pre-medicine at Miami Dade College.
Despite the distance, Chris-
tian and Arias’ friendship re-mained intact. Arias made plans over the summer to visit his best friend for Gator Growl.
“I always kept a connec-
tion with Christian,” Arias said. “Nothing much had changed.”
Their plans were interrupted 
when Christian went missing.
Arias came to him anyway . 
He joined the search party the weekend after Christian went missing. On Friday , he was headed into work in Miami when he heard the news: Hunt-ers had found a body 40 miles southwest of Gainesville, and police believed it was Christian.
“My time with him was cut 
off way too quickly ,” he said. “I feel like I have Christian’s pres-ence around me, but I have to tell myself that my friend just died, and I can’t process that.”
A fan of the Barcelona Foot-
ball Club, Iron Man and eating out with friends, Christian was “the friend you had to have,” Arias said.
“Being Christian’s friend was 
such a valuable thing for me,” he said. “Every time I hung out with Chris, it was like winning 
the lottery.”
Christian liked rap and of-
ten listened to Kanye West, Kid 
Cudi and the Notorious B.I.G. He carried a 160-GB iPod every-where he went.
“He was an extremely smart 
kid,” said his brother, 16-year-old Alexander Aguilar. “He 
knew what he wanted, and he 
knew how to get it.”
The siblings shared a close 
relationship while growing up. They played soccer, watched

Job prospects could be looking up for 
students graduating in 2013.
The National Association of Colleges 
and Employers published a survey last 
month that found employers projected a 13 percent increase in new-college-grad-uate hiring.
According to the survey, the top 10 
bachelor’s degrees in demand for the graduating class of 2013 include ﬁ  nance at No. 1 and economics at No. 10. Others listed were business administration and mechanical engineering
“I think this information is showing 
a positive sign and that the economy 
is getting better slowly,” said Heather 
White, director of the Career Resource Center.
White said students in technology 
ﬁ  elds aren’t the only ones whose job op-
portunities could be increasing.
“I see the positive trend all around,” 
she said. “One of the largest student 
groups by major that come by the [Ca-
reer Resource Center] is liberal arts.”
White said many people don’t realize 
that technology-based companies also 
hire nontechnology students because Hiring for new college 
graduates projected to

UF students who were eligible for Bright 
Futures Scholarships between 2005 and 
2007 may be affected by a computer secu-
rity breach at Northwest Florida State Col-
lege.
The college is investigating the breach 
and will notify people if their personal in-formation, including Social Security num-
bers, could be accessed from the Internet, 
according to a UF news release.
UF was informed of the breach last week, 
but it could be up to 45 days from the time the college found out about the leak until 
people are notiﬁ  ed, UF spokeswoman Jan-ine Sikes said.
“It’s a huge, long, lengthy process,” 
Sikes said.
No leaks occurred at UF, and the univer-
sity is referring people with questions to 
Northwest Florida State College.
Erica Bass, a 24-year-old UF alumna, 
said she’s not sure the Bright Futures data-base has any information she’d be worried about, but she was concerned she hadn’t heard about the breach yet.
“I would want to know what kind of 
information could’ve been compromised,” she said. “I feel like this should be maybe bigger news.”
Bright Futures recipients of the 2005-
2006 and 2006-2007 academic year who attended any Florida college or university should call 1-800-688-0656 with questions.

The UF Supreme Court of the Stu-
dent Body ruled Monday that two 
Student Government election codes were unconstitutionally vague.
One code stated candidates or rep-
resentatives of political parties can only distribute campaign material via hand-to-hand delivery, residence hall boxes, email or standard mail. The code also states that candidates or political party representatives can only display campaign material in on-campus residence halls if they have permission from the owner or have 
complied with the policies established 
by the Department of Housing and Residence Education.
The other code the court ruled as 
unconstitutionally vague stated that candidates must leave campaign ma-terial that the candidate carries upside down or reversed when unattended.
Monday night, Associate Justice 
Michael Hacker said the statutes have ambiguities.
“It is impossible to simultaneously 
enforce them,” he said after the hear -
ing. He said when dealing with con-flicts like this, the least specific statute is eliminated.
One of the contradictory statutes 
the court discussed said that cloth, plastic or paper banners can be hung only in areas designated by the univer -
sity and the supervisor of elections.
Chief Justice Matt Michel said the 
codes the court struck down were “vague, contradictory and impossible to simultaneously comply.”

◗ THERE HAVE BEEN 4,249 
CASES OF WEST NILE NATIONWIDE.
KELCEE GRIFFIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
One month after the Alachua 
County Health Department found 
two Gainesville chickens that test-ed positive for West Nile virus, Anthony Dennis, county environ-
mental health director, said the 
county is buzzing with surveil-lance and precautions.
There have been 4,249 cases of West Nile reported nationwide so far, including 168 deaths, accord-ing to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dennis said the health de-
partment’s strategies have not changed in the last month. It con-
tinues to run weekly blood tests 
on sample chickens to look for the West Nile antibody, which can in-dicate the disease’s presence in an area.
He said the department also 
continues to collect mosquito samples to monitor the numbers of the Culex nigripalpus mosqui-
to variety, the species capable of 
carrying West Nile if infected.Dennis said the health depart-
ment is also keeping an eye on the situation by tracking community input.
He said large-animal veteri-
narians have frequently reported when horses are infected with 
West Nile. Horses are particularly 
susceptible to the disease.
While the virus is still main-
taining a presence in Alachua County, Dennis said this trend is partly due to standing water left by Tropical Storm Debby in July.
He said no human cases have 
been reported in the county so 
far.
“Our function is mainly in the surveillance,” Dennis said, “so we 
continue to monitor all the sur -
veillance data closely and advise the public as necessary.”
Right now, Dennis said, the 
advice to the public is to take per -
sonal precautions.He said the health department’s 
theme, “drain and cover,” means residents should drain standing water, cover their windows with screens and cover themselves with repellant or extra clothing.
Catherine Seemann, advertis-
ing, marketing and media coor -
dinator for the UF Student Health Care Center, said the center con-tinues to follow the health de-partment’s lead and to relay the information it publishes across campus.
“We can’t go to somebody’s 
house and fix their screens and 
make them wear repellant, but we 
can educate them,” she said.

Centertelevision and studied together. Christian 
especially loved the show “Scrubs.”
Alexander Aguilar said he watched his 
brother mature before going off to college. With a knack for math and an interest in 
the arts, Christian excelled in his academ-
ics, graduating summa cum laude from Doral Academy Preparatory School.
“He wouldn’t have to have my parents 
push him,” Alexander Aguilar said. “He would push himself.”
Since Christian was in middle school, 
he had wanted to attend UF.
“Christian liked the environment, and 
he was determined to go,” Arias said.
Arias remembered the phone call he re-ceived when Christian got into UF.
“He told me, ‘My life has just changed, 
I got accepted into UF,’” Arias said. “It made me happy that my friend did. I was supportive 100 percent of the way.”
Christian planned to become a cardiol-
ogist. He wanted to change people’s lives by performing heart surgery.
“It’s delicate work, but Christian said 
he could do it,” Arias said.

The Aguilar family’s dream of their 
son going to college and starting a new life came to an abrupt end in September.
On Monday, the family was notified 
that police positively identified the body 
found in Levy County as Christian’s.Later that night, about 150 people 
packed the St. Augustine Church to attend 
a memorial service.
Carlos and Claudia Aguilar, Christian’s 
parents, sat in the front row as priests led the church in prayer and gospel readings.
UF President Bernie Machen expressed 
his condolences to the Aguilars, saying he and the university were devastated about 
Christian’s death.
“When we lose a student like Christian, 
it is a loss not only for those who knew 
him but for our whole community , and also for his family’s communities in Mi-ami and in Colombia,” he said. “Christian was missing for a time, but he can never be lost again — he is in our hearts, and in our souls … that we will remember forever.”
Dave Kratzer, vice president of Student 
Affairs, praised police and the Gainesville community for assisting the Aguilar fam-ily in the search.
“Sometimes we see the very best in 
people during times of crisis,” Kratzer said. “There’s an amazing strength in or -
dinary people that manifests itself when it matters the most.”
Carlos and Claudia Aguilar were the 
last to speak. They stood at the lectern, wearing Gators T-shirts.
Carlos Aguilar thanked volunteers and 
police officers for their support.
“All those people deserve to be known 
because they are doing something that would be, in this community, a landmark,” he said.
Even though Christian will no longer 
walk UF’s campus, his name and story have touched lives, including that of Scar -
lett Diaz. Diaz, 18, made a tribute video to her lost friend, saying the day Christian went missing would stay with her for the rest of her life.
With Christian resting in peace, Diaz 
says in the video, she is reminded of his 
presence.
“He is in the sea, in the rain, in the river 
… becoming one with nature, becoming 
one with God.”
Contact Chris Alcantara at calcantara@
alligator.org.each company has different departments. The 
survey showed that of those employers sur -
veyed, the ones likely to increase hiring of new 
college graduates were in fields like computer 
and electronics manufacturing, retail trade, real estate, and chemical and pharmaceutical manu-facturing.
Although no liberal arts or humanities de-
grees made it on the survey’s list, many UF stu-dents are still hopeful.
English and history senior Dylan Fay, 21, 
said he’s not scared of unemployment.
“I think there will always be a demand for 
people who think critically,” he said.
However, sociology senior Sherry Akanni, 
22, said she’s concerned about not getting a 
job. But she said internships and leadership ac-
tivities often make students more marketable to employers.
Others, like health education and behavior 
junior Esther Celestin, 20, plan on enrolling in graduate school.
“Getting a bachelor’s is not enough,” she 
said.
Economics and history junior Josh Cole, 20, 
said he thinks the survey results are promising.
“It appears a recovery is under way , despite 
policies that work against it,” he said.
Cole plans to attend graduate school; he said 
he believes he will have a greater chance of get-ting a job in the future. He said it’s good to “wait it out a little bit.”
As for students’ time at UF, White suggests 
students network with potential employers, plan career goals and utilize the CRC.
“My motto here is ‘Come early and often,’” 
she said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2012

Former Gators running back Fred Taylor 
came to UF on Monday to warn students not 
to fumble when it comes to student loans.
Taylor, a class of ’98 UF alumnus and for -
mer Jacksonville Jaguars running back, came 
out to the Plaza of the Americas on Monday 
afternoon to support student loan site Loan-look.com.
Loanlook.com provides federal and pri-
vate loan information, budgeting tools and a live chat with trained loan 
counselors, all on one dash-board that can be accessed from students’ computers 
and phones.
“I saw the interest my 
family accrued on their stu-
dent loans as time went by , and it was a financial night-mare,” he said. “I made it to 
the NFL, so they would hit me up to help pay off the loans, and it even got draining on me.”
Sabrina Blake, a second-year UF marriage and family counseling graduate student, said she admired that Taylor came back to support the community where he got his start.
Blake, 24, grinned from ear to ear as she 
posed for a photo with Taylor.
“The fact that he is a well-known athlete 
and keeps the Jacksonville and UF communi-ties in his heart will help students be aware of the different options they have financially ,” Blake said.
Taylor said he knew it was important to 
engage students about their financial situation because they need to know what they are get-ting into with student loans and how to handle them in the future.
He said Loanlook.com is the solution to 
getting the right background information on 
loans.
The site will tell students how much they 
owe on their loan, the interest on it and who 
they owe the money to.
“I think we see students way too much 
nowadays take out student loans carelessly and don’t look at the future impact,” said Alex Romero, a 21-year-old linguistics junior. “The site looks very convenient.” Former Gators football player runs back to support loan website

The third-best-known political 
party in the United States believes 
in economic freedom and individ-
ual liberty.
“We’re the party of peace and 
prosperity ,” said Adrian Wyllie, 
chairman of the Libertarian Party of 
Florida.Libertarian vice presidential can-
didate Jim Grey will speak about 
educational reform and other im-
portant issues at 10 a.m. today in the 
Reitz Union Auditorium.
Wyllie said neither the Republi-
can nor Democratic parties follow 
through with what they promise. 
Libertarians are the only party that wants to balance the budget, elimi-nate the Federal Reserve, and end the war overseas and the war on drugs.
UF student Josh Vadeboncoeur 
invited Grey to campus.
Vadeboncoeur, a 20-year-old po-
litical science junior and campus co-
ordinator for the Gary Johnson 2012 
campaign, reached out to his camp earlier this year.The event, hosted by the Graham 
Area Council and Inter-Residence Hall Association, aims to inform 
UF students of 
all candidates for 
the 2012 election. 
Grey will not be paid to speak.
“There are 
more than two 
parties, and the 
Graham Area 
Council thinks it’s important to in-form students and residents there 
are more candidates than what they 
see on TV ,” said Brandy Myers, 20-year-old business and criminol-ogy sophomore and Graham Area 
Council president.
Tori Lovins, a 19-year-old biol-
ogy sophomore, said she’s looking 
forward to hearing the Libertarian vice presidential candidate speak.

stand your own beliefs, you must expose yourself to others,” she said. Libertarian vice presidential candidate to speak at UF today

Consul General of Israel to Flor -
ida and Puerto Rico, Chaim Sha-
cham, spoke at UF Hillel on Monday about politics in what he called “one of the toughest neighborhoods in 
the world.”
“Personally , I wouldn’t have minded if Joseph had brought us 
to Canada,” he joked in front of a crowd of about 60 student leaders.
Attendees heard the consul gen-
eral speak about the fallout from the Arab Spring revolutions and the dangers of a nuclear-capable Iran to 
both Israel and the U.S.
“There cannot be a more impor -
tant time for campus leaders to un-derstand the U.S.-Israel relationship 
and the threat Iran poses to both of our countries,” said Taylor Nichole Parker, a 20-year-old political sci-ence junior and vice president of Gators for Israel, the organization that brought the consul general.
Nominees for Florida’s third con-
gressional district Ted Yoho and J.R. 
Gaillot also spoke to students about 
their political platforms.
Shacham told students how re-
cently ousted Arab regimes have been replaced by radical Islamic leadership in the last year.
“A change in the Arab world isn’t 
like one more regime change,” he said. “It’s a historic tsunami, which 
sort of reorients the relationship of 
Western democracies with a good quarter of the world.”
Now, decisions in those coun-
tries are made on the basis of tribal allegiance instead of national securi-ty issues, Shacham said. As a result, civil rights, equal suffrage and rule of law have suffered.
“This a step 100 years back,” he 
said. “It’s a change of the purpose of a state in the Arab world.”
He also spoke about how a nucle-
ar-capable Iran could obtain a hege-mony over the Persian Gulf. Iranian leaders have expressed their inten-tions to attack Israel with nuclear weapons in the past.
Shacham said he wanted to re-
frame the news students read about Israel. Leah Robbins, a 19-year-old Jewish studies freshman who spent a year living in Israel, agreed.
“Israel is very misrepresented in 
the media,” she said. “Israel is not some imperialist country trying to get land. It’s in a constant state of defense.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

◗ A FERAL CAT COLONY 
IS LIVING NEAR BRYAN HALL. 
KELLY PRICE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Kat Worden heard 
there was a cat trapped under 
sealed grates near Bryan Hall on UF’s campus Monday, she went home to get a crowbar.
Worden, the office manag-
er at the Warrington College of Business Administration’s Center for Management Com-munication, said “it wouldn’t matter if it was a puppy or a kitten or a raccoon” — she wanted to save the crying ani-mal.
Worden’s removing of the 
grate is one of many recent ac-tions taken by a handful of UF employees to care for a feral cat colony near Bryan Hall, which houses Warrington.
UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the university’s policy prohibits the feeding 
of wild animals, be they rac-
coons, alligators or cats. How-ever, trapping or removal of animals is up to the Environ-mental Health and Safety Di-vision.
Sikes said she didn’t know 
of any complaints about a trapped cat beneath the Bryan 
Hall grates this week or ever 
before.
“There have been no calls 
from anyone letting us know there was a cat there. No one alerted us or notified us,” she said. “This is the first issue I’ve heard of related to cats in my five years here.”
About a month ago, Bry-
an Hall was treated for ants, roaches and fleas, said Bill Properzio, director of the En-vironmental Health and Safe-ty Division. He said his team tried to determine what was attracting the pests. Raccoons or cats could be to blame.
Workers secured openings 
beneath the building with grates, Properzio said, and they didn’t look for animals that might have been trapped beneath.
“You can tell there’s a cat-
hating community among workers,” said Joan Lyon, se-
nior secretary at Warrington.
Monday, Lyon said a co-
worker heard a cat’s cries 
coming from the grate. Lyon managed to push some food and water through the grates to the “half-dead” cat.
“We should have prob-
ably told the Physical Plant 
to make sure no animals were 
down there,” Properzio said. “We’re not trying to do ani-
mal cruelty or anything like 
that.”
He said that while he un-
derstands why some people may be passionate about sav-ing the cats, food left for them often attracts other animals like raccoons and roaches. He said as predatory animals, 
the cats also negatively affect 
wildlife like birds and rep-tiles.
Properzio’s department 
traps cats infrequently, he said, but when they do, the cats are sent to Alachua Coun-ty Animal Services. There, Worden said, the cats are of-
ten euthanized.
Properzio said he wasn’t 
sure if there was an alterna-
tive, viable policy or solution UF could implement.
Worden said UF employ-
ees around the Bryan Hall area have been catching the cats and paying out of pocket 
for their spaying or neutering, 
and vaccinations. Worden even kept one and named it Luther. She said she has found homes for at least three litters born at UF and is cur -
rently fostering four kittens.
Julie Levy, director of the 
College of Veterinary Medi-
cine Maddie’s Shelter Medi-
cal Program at UF, said the solution lies in coordination across UF’s campus. If noth-ing is done, the feral cat pop-ulation will grow to a “nui-sance” level, she said.
At the University of Cen-
tral Florida, Levy said, volun-
teers reduced the on-campus 
cat population from more than 100 to about 10 now over 20 years. She said volunteers spayed and neutered older cats and sent younger ones to be adopted.
She said UF has an added 
advantage because there’s a 
veterinary school on campus.
“The policy on campus has 
been to remove the cats, so 
it’s technically against policy [to help them],” Levy said. “We haven’t taken an active role yet, although we would like to.”
Back at Warrington, Lyon 
said cat-loving employees need help from UF to contin-ue caring for the feral felines.
“It’s not easy, and it’s ex-
pensive, and we’re receiving no assistance from UF,” Lyon said. “My dream would be for UF to adopt a policy like those around the country that 
allows the population to nat-
urally die off. For having one of the best vet colleges in the country, it’s just really not the best we can do.”UF employees urge 
action before catastrophe strikes

For this week, the walls inside Reid Hall have 
transformed into a collage of colored canvases, and 
its floor space has become a sea of 3-D forms.
UF’s Inter-Residence Hall Association has set 
up its annual art gallery, which this year is themed 
“The Nature of Art.” The grand opening event was 
Monday night, and the art will be up in Reid Hall’s first floor Fine Arts Living Learning Community space until Friday.
From intricate drawings and paintings to expres-
sive photography and sculpture, all art featured in the gallery is student-submitted. The deadline to 
submit artwork was Friday. Students of all majors 
were invited to submit work of any medium.
Elizabeth Lunior, director of the art gallery and 
a 19-year-old psychology sophomore, said she and three assistant directors decided on the theme be-cause they believe it provoked interest and left room for artistic expression. But submissions didn’t have to be nature-themed.
“We thought it would be appealing to a large 
range of students and also to the artistic-appreciat-ing community as well,” she said.
The directors intend the main focus to be on the 
students’ work, Lunior said, not the nature-themed decorations.
She said the gallery strives to unite both artistic 
students who wish to showcase their creativity in a public environment and other students who are solely interested in viewing and discussing art.
“A lot of people don’t realize the amount of tal-ent that’s on this campus,” Lunior said. “The event is a great way to promote artistic passion that you don’t normally see in everyday university life.”
Sarah Flanders, a 19-year-old animal science 
sophomore, said she was excited to show her large black-and-white photography piece in this year’s gallery. The piece is a collage of 12 still-life images, including portraits of family and friends and cap-tured moments from everyday life, she said.
Displaying her art in the IRHA gallery is thrill-
ing, not only because she’s able to show her work, but also because the artists can bounce ideas off of each other, she said.
“You’re able to get ideas from others’ art and 
play it off in your own work,” Flanders said.
Health science senior and IRHA staff member Ali-
cia Jeffrey, 21, said she’s excited to visit this year’s gallery because it’s impressive to see what types of 
artwork other students are creating.
She said she believes the gallery provides a re-
freshing social atmosphere for students.
“It’s a little touch of culture in the swarm of not-
so-classy alternative outings at Midtown,” Jeffrey 
said.IRHA gallery promotes artistic passionHe spoke at UF Hillel
“A lot of people don’t realize the amount 
of talent that’s on this campus. The event is 
a great way to promote artistic passion that 
you don’t normally see in everyday univer -
sity life.”

Not all lady 
journalists are great 
Maybe you’ve noticed that we’re strong proponents of 
women’s rights here at the Alligator. Because we’re, like, humans or whatever. No big deal.
That doesn’t mean we have to be fans of every lady to ever 
grace this planet.
Enter Barbara Walters.She’s not our favorite journalist or our favorite lady . She 
never lets her co-hosts on “The View” speak because she thinks she’s more important than them; in the case of Elisabeth Hassel-beck, we’re less upset. Her words aren’t always important.
Walters has had a historical career, as far as interviews go. 
She interviewed Gaddaﬁ   and Castro, as well as Miss Lewinski.
If you want a scoop, Walters is the one who will have it.Enter Lindsay Lohan.
She’s, uh, not exactly the poster child for a successful career. 
Or a successful life. But, she’ll be portraying Elizabeth Taylor in 
the upcoming movie “Liz & Dick.”
Lohan hasn’t had a major interview since March, when Matt 
Lauer asked her about the end of her probation and about host-ing “Saturday Night Live.”
Ever since, she’s basically been going out with Amanda 
Bynes and hitting everyone with their cars.
Last week, she got into a huge argument with her mom and 
ended up calling her dad in the middle of it, claiming that her mom was totally on crack. Scandalous, right?
There’s drama going on everywhere all the time, and Ameri-
cans just love to hear about it. It’s why the paparazzi have such a strong business model.
Lohan might also have a strong business model, but it’s not a 
healthy one. Plus, the poor girl has even endorsed Mitt Romney for president. That’s when you really know that someone needs help, am I right, folks? Right?
Just because Barbara Walters was a respected journalist 
doesn’t mean she is one anymore. Why did she break down so many doors or barriers for female reporters if she’s going to waste all of that on a damn interview with Lindsay Lohan.
We can understand covering that kind of thing when you’re 
a young buck just out of journalism school, but there are more important topics to cover.
For example, Babs could have done a piece on the Taliban 
shooting victim in Pakistan, Malala Yousafzai. She was shot be-
cause she was advocating for the education of girls in schools.
“The Taliban have said they will target her again,” said a BBC 
article.
Astounding. Terrifying.
Much more worthy of coverage, Barbara Walters, than a ce-
lebrity-former-teen-star woman in trouble.
Yousafzai is being airlifted from Pakistan to the U.K. for fur-
ther medical treatment.
“She remains in a serious condition after the attack, which 
the Taliban said they had carried out because she had been ‘pro-
moting secularism,’” said the BBC.
Seems like a better cause than Lindsay “Caused a Scene Be-
cause She was Drunk and/ or High” Lohan.
Soda industry combats Bloomberg’s limits
Restrictions proposed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
and approved by the Board of Health plan to ban the sale of sugary drinks and sodas in containers larger 
than 16 ounces at restaurants, street carts and entertainment venues in New York City.
However, a group composed of soft-drink industry lead-
ers, and New York restaurants and businesses ﬁ  led a lawsuit in hopes to overturn the restriction.
Mayor Bloomberg was previously successful in imple-
menting a smoking ban and mandatory disclosure of calorie information at dining establishments in the New York City area.
He and advisers feel the Board of Health has every right 
and responsibility to see that this regulation passes for the 
safety of the public.
The businesses involved in ﬁ  ling this lawsuit are extreme-
ly bold and seem to disagree to the point of legal action.
Whose argument is more valid?
The Board of Health’s goal is to encourage healthier 
choices in beverage consumption, and by doing so, to incite a reduction of obesity and related health issues.
Businesses feel they shouldn’t be limited in what they sell 
and how they sell it for the sake of proﬁ  t. They also want 
customer satisfaction to stay high — “consumer freedom,” 
they call it.
The freedom to drink all the sugary soda you want and 
not have to go through a hassle to get it, that is.
I personally don’t believe that is how we should show ap-
preciation for the free choice we do have in this country.
Unfortunately, a wide variety of dining establishments 
and access to all kinds of food and drinks have played a con-siderable role in health issues resulting from irresponsible 
dietary habits.
Dining out and dining heavily is extremely popular in 
our culture. Sometimes people don’t know how much is 
enough.
Maybe legislation like this should be considered and not 
seen as absolutely outrageous.
However, if this regulation were to go through, how ef-
fective would it really be?New Yorkers could still have 
all the soda they wanted. They’d just have to purchase it at a higher overall cost and carry it around in 16-ounce containers. The soda 
industry and New York beverage 
and dining establishments are sat-isﬁ  ed.
Maybe some will feel embar-
rassed, self-conscious or ﬁ  nancial-
ly angered by having to do so and will limit themselves. The Board of Health is satisﬁ  ed.  
Take the couple on a date at the movies. What if they want 
to share a drink? Considering packaging and lids, is it more 
environmentally friendly to use one large container rather 
than two smaller ones?
A friend of mine fell subject to gaining the “freshman 15” 
during her ﬁ  rst year as a college student. Looking back and thinking about it, she cited her successful effort to take com-plete advantage of unlimited soda reﬁ  lls in the dining halls as a contributing factor.
The soda debate is just one part of a bigger issue.One thing I’ve learned in my life is that you cannot save 
everybody. No matter how hard you try to help someone, not every person will take heed to advice or aid that is given with their beneﬁ  t in mind.
In our society, many people believe that just because they 
have certain rights and privileges, any type of behavior is ac-ceptable.
We live on the premise of threats and, honestly, sometimes 
do positive things only because we’re required to.
When federal laws have to stop people from making 
unwise decisions regarding their personal health and well-being, it says something about our society.
Just make good choices. We should practice our right to 
make decisions as we please but shouldn’t use it as an excuse for absent-minded, irresponsible or reckless behavior of any sort.

Sex is a tough subject to be open about, and as a 
result, it is usually hushed, its meaning lost be-tween the lines. 
But no matter how hard it is to be serious about sex, 
it’s even harder to hold an open dialogue about sexual 
health — and specifically, the human papillomavirus, 
otherwise known as HPV .
Last week, Gardasil, one of two vaccines protect-
ing against many forms of HPV , was given the OK in 
a study conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center. At most, the vaccination could result in a skin infection or same-day fainting — a preferred alter -
native to cervical cancer.
This is a fantastic step forward for cancer preven-
tion, and hopefully it will drive down the death rate 
due to cervical cancer, which is one of the most fatal 
cancers observed in women. However, the study won’t 
dispel the controversial nature of the vaccine. In the 
six years since the Food and Drug Administration ap-proved the vaccine, Gardasil has undergone so much scrutiny for a vast number of reasons — but all of them come back to society’s discomfort with acknowledging the nature of sex.
While I was in high school, I remember the adminis-
trators encouraging the Student 
Body to get vaccinated. But the 
girls I knew made fun of each 
other if they did end up receiv-
ing the vaccination because that 
must mean “she’s a whore.” Some parents even looked down on their friends for getting their girls vaccinated because they must have been somehow “tainted.”
I doubt those who took part in the backlash — both 
on the community and political levels— understood 
that cervical cancer is directly caused by HPV and that 
the vaccine would prevent transmission of the virus. I also doubt they understood that the vaccination is most effective if administered prior to being sexually active.
It’s this lack of understanding about the vaccine 
that puts people off from promoting it. There may be a general understanding that Gardasil can lower your chances of developing cervical cancer, but people have 
still stigmatized the vaccine: Those who receive it must 
be sexually promiscuous — why else would they need to be vaccinated?
The medicine behind prevention has made great 
strides in progress within the past decade. We have the power to make cervical cancer virtually nonexistent.
But we need to catch up psychologically. We need to 
put aside our fears for being considered socially taint-
ed because risking a cancer diagnosis isn’t worth fitting 
into social standards.

UWireI am concerned that other universities around the coun-
try have implemented a more humane policy concern-ing their feral cat populations than UF. Although cur -
rent UF policy forbids feeding stray animals, some of us feel responsible for the number of cat colonies that exist on campus.
Current UF Policy:I communicated with Ken Glover, UF’s pest manage-
ment coordinator, earlier this year after learning that cats were being trapped and was informed that UF was a wild-life sanctuary and that “feral cats and native wildlife are incompatible.”  Once trapped, the cats are taken to Alachua 
County Animal Services, where they are euthanized.  
A number of us have participated in Operation Catnip’s 
program to trap, neuter and release the adult cats back into 
their colony.  Several of the kittens and a few adult cats have been placed in loving homes. Although we realize that 
most of the cats in the colonies are feral, and we cannot find 
homes for all of them, we hope to change UF’s policy con-cerning the feral population to be more humane. After all, humans caused the problem; we should fix it humanely.
Future UF Policy:
Other universities have managed feral cat populations 
in a more humane way, and I feel confident that with a few 
changes, UF would be able to do the same. UF should fol-
low directives given from programs at institutions such 
as Stanford University, The University of Texas at Austin, 
Texas A&M University and several others.The cats on campus could be 
managed with a few minor changes. 
Operation Catnip and the UF Small 
Animal Hospital are already work-
ing together to trap, neuter and re-
turn feral cats to their colonies.  This solution successfully decreases the population, reduces birth rates and improves the overall health of the colony.
Julie K. Levy, a doctor of veterinary medicine, is the di-
rector of Maddie’s Shelter Medicine Program at UF’s Col-lege of Veterinary Medicine, a proponent of the trap-neuter-release program and works with Operation Catnip.
“The results of our study indicated that long-term reduc-
tion of free-roaming cat numbers is feasible by TNR,” Levy wrote in an article published in 2003. “It has been reported that feral cats become less aggressive toward each other and more friendly toward their feeders following neuter -
ing, and this may have encouraged adoption of previously feral cats.”
UF has the resources and the heart to take care of this 
problem humanely and effectively. The current approach is inhumane, distasteful and could be a public relations night-
mare. 
I am confident that we can find a better way to deal with 
this, and I hope that you, as a fellow animal lover, are will-ing to take a stand.

More people know Wayne 
Wheeler by his pets than by his 
name.
When people ask for him, a 
puzzled look glazes over the faces 
of the members of the Pentecostal 
Church of Gainesville.
Then, a glimmer of recognition.
“Oh, you mean Raccoon Man?” 
an elderly woman asked. “I think he’s changing into his choir robes now.”
Wheeler is the proud owner of 
three pet raccoons: Sister Ricky, a 
feisty 3-year-old; Sheba, Wheeler’s 
little baby; and Eli, who acts more 
like a monkey than a raccoon.
The word “pet” may be inap-
propriate to describe Wheeler’s re-lationship with these animals. They have their own room in his home. 
They come with him across town 
when Wheeler’s company, All 
Maintenance & Remodeling, gets a 
call to do a job. Wheeler’s car has been transformed into a raccoon sanctuary.
He opened the side door of 
his minivan, and three furry faces 
peered out into the night.
“Come here, little monkey!” the 
47-year-old squealed to Eli. “Come 
give Papa a hug!”
Eli jumped onto Wheeler’s 
shoulder and climbed onto his 
back. The nimble animal made a dive for Wheeler’s back pocket be-
fore Wheeler put him back in the 
car.
“Watch out, they’ll empty your 
pockets,” Wheeler said. “Their fa-vorite toy is my wallet.”
Though Wheeler’s eyes light up 
with excitement nowadays, he said 
they used to be full of drug-fueled despair.
He grew up in the small town of 
Palatka, and he said he went from sometimes sneaking in a beer with a bad group of friends to being completely dependent on alcohol 
and crack cocaine.
He spent much of his young 
adult life drifting in and out of the 
Putnam County Courthouse, cash-ing in paychecks to feed his grow-ing addictions and being generally dissatisfied with his life.
“I was ready to blow my freak-
ing brains out,” Wheeler said. “I 
had friends with so many [heroin] 
track marks, it looked like they had 
chicken pox.”
He tried cleaning up once, but 
he soon found himself back in front of “his” judge, Peter T. Miller.
Wheeler said he was going to 
give the judge a scripted answer 
so he could get off with probation, 
but he felt different this time — like something had come over him.
“I told my judge, ‘If you don’t 
put me in jail, I’ll die out here,’” Wheeler remembered.
The judge gave him a year in the 
county jail, which thrilled Wheeler.
He used that time to get clean 
and get his life on the straight and 
narrow. He also found God, who 
he credits for his successes.
“He exposed the emptiness of 
my soul and filled it,” Wheeler said passionately.
After he was released from 
jail, he got an unexpected phone call from a friend. The friend told Wheeler about two baby raccoons he found behind a Lowe’s Home 
Improvement store and asked if 
Wheeler wanted the animals.
They were wild at first — seem-
ingly untamable. He named them Rocky and Ricky, who was later re-named Sister Ricky when Wheeler found out her gender.
While Sister Ricky seemed to 
mellow as time wore on, Rocky was a fierce ball of energy.
He’d growl. He’d bite. He’d 
jump around the room so fast you couldn’t even see him to catch him.
In short, he was a handful. But 
Wheeler knew what to do.
He was living with a few other 
post-prisoners when he decided to gather everyone in the living area.
“We prayed over Rocky at the 
halfway house,” Wheeler said. “Three weeks later, he turned into nothing but a teddy bear.”
Years later, Rocky accidentally 
licked some of his topical flea med-ication and died of a heart attack.
Wheeler and Sister Ricky were 
devastated.
But Wheeler and Sister Ricky 
welcomed two new friends to share Wheeler’s nest of a car.
When it’s quiet and Wheeler 
isn’t around, the three masked 
mammals slink around the car, 
stopping only to investigate a loose piece of fabric and sniff the dash-board.
The second the door opens, 
they’re ready to play.
Wheeler jolted a seat in the car 
and Eli took off, practically flying from seat to seat.
Sister Ricky will suck on Wheel-
er’s thumb if she’s in the mood, and she can unscrew the cap of a water bottle with her little hands and drink.
Despite her training, Sister Ricky 
still refuses a harness and leash, un-like her two companions.
“They’re exactly like a 3-year-
old little boy with ADHD,” Wheel-er said. “They can hold things like 
a kid, but they play and eat like kit-
tens.”
But raccoons are unlike most 
animals people are accustomed to.
They have two coats of thick, 
coarse fur. They love to splash around in water and shake their heads when they want to play.
Wheeler said they make more 
than 200 distinct noises.
What may be more fascinating 
than the animals themselves are people’s responses to Wheeler’s domesticated raccoons.
Some of his favorite responses 
happen at red lights.
Once, a couple of girls pulled up 
next to him, drumming a beat on their dashboard. When they looked over at him, Wheeler grabbed Sis-ter Ricky and held her up to the window.
“They flipped,” he said.But no matter what others 
may think about his unusual pets, Wheeler wouldn’t give them up for 
the world.
“They’re my best friends,” he 
said. “I don’t know what I’d do 
without them.”

The Institute of Museum and Library 
Services recently awarded UF’s George 
A. Smathers Libraries a $477,312 National Leadership grant. 
UF and the libraries jointly matched the 
contribution with $541,976, according to a press release.
“You could apply for up to $500,000,” 
said Rachel Schipper, associate dean of Technology & Support Services for the li-braries and co-principal investigator of the grant. “Our award of the $477,312 is pretty much one of the top awards that we could have been given.”The grants will be used for three years 
toward the Panama Canal collection the libraries received from the Panama Canal 
Museum in Seminole, Fla., after it closed 
in March. 
The museum transferred 20,000 objects 
to the UF libraries.
Some of the objects are currently being 
housed on campus, and others are stored in a climate-controlled facility.
“We have a very large Latin American 
collection,” Schipper said. “That is one of 
the reasons the museum chose to have the 
objects here permanently.”
Schipper said the grant will be used for 
processing the collection, which includes some digitization, creating exhibits and educational materials centered around the Panama Canal, hiring employees to pro-
cess the collection and managing volun-
teers.
Lauren Wright, a 25-year-old political 
science graduate student, said she thought 
the Panama Canal was a huge accomplish-
ment for Americans.
The 100th anniversary of the Panama Canal’s completion will take place in 2014. 
As part of the anniversary, the librar -
ies and collaborators will host a centennial celebration of the canal in August 2014 that will run through Spring 2015. 
The yearlong celebration will include 
local exhibits, educational seminars and conferences.
Non-UF institutions participating in the 
collaboration include Tampa’s Museum of Science and Industry, the Natural History 
Museum of San Diego, Museo del Canal 
Interoceánico de Panamá and the Associa-tion of Southeast Research Libraries, ac-cording to the release. UF Libraries receives grant for museum-library collaboration

Senior linebacker Jon Bostic (1) pursues Vanderbilt quarterback Jordan Rodgers (11) during Florida’s 31-17 win on Saturday at Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville, Tenn. 
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Jon Bostic just keeps doing the same 
thing over and over again. 
  It’s been a successful approach. 
  Through the ﬁ  rst six games of the 
2011 season, Bostic recorded ﬁ  ve tack-
les for a loss and three sacks. 
This year, he has sacked opposing 
quarterbacks three times and has re-corded six tackles for a loss in as many games.
  “Not really,” Bostic said when 
asked if the coaches had been using 
him differently. “A lot of things are 
the same.”
  Despite similar results, Bostic noted 
that his explosiveness has improved.
  Bostic displayed his ability to get 
into the backﬁ  eld on the ﬁ  rst play of the fourth quarter in Florida’s 31-17 win at Vanderbilt on Saturday. 
He ran around Commodores right 
tackle Andrew Bridges nearly un-touched and stripped the ball from quarterback Jordan Rodgers. Neiron Ball recovered the fumble on Vander-
bilt’s 14-yard line.
  Bostic’s ﬁ  ve-tackle performance 
against the Commodores earned him 
defensive player of the game recogni-tion from coach Will Muschamp, who 
said Bostic has fought through blocks 
more effectively this season.  “He’s getting on big linemen in our 
league and shedding them and getting off and making plays,” Muschamp said. “You’re going to get blocked. That’s going to happen. Good play-
ers don’t stay blocked long, and Jon 
hasn’t.”
  Fellow veteran linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins has missed three games with a fractured right thumb and a left ham-
string injury. 
The two usually share organization-
al duties on the ﬁ  eld, so Bostic has had 
to handle more responsibility when it comes to instructing other defenders 
where to be on each play.
  Several underclassmen have seen 
time on defense for Florida this sea-
son, including freshman defensive end Jonathan Bullard and freshmen 
linebackers Dante Fowler Jr. and An-
tonio Morrison. Bostic said he’s done a better job of helping his inexperienced teammates.
  “Really just trying to get the defense 
lined up,” Bostic said of his  Linebacker continues to produce during senior season

 On March 10, Casey Prather leapt into 
the national spotlight.  
  Midway through the ﬁ  rst half of the 
Southeastern Conference Tournament 
semiﬁ  nals against Kentucky, the 6-foot-6 
Prather drove down the lane and emphati-cally dunked over Wildcats forward Kyle Wiltjer. 
  Although it was Prather’s only ﬁ  eld goal 
of the game, the highlight slam earned the swingman a spot on ESPN’s top-10 plays. 
  “It helped identify that I’m capable of 
doing things like that,” Prather said. “It helped prove to myself that I’m capable of doing it. It’s just up to me to go do it.”
  After struggling with turnovers and un-
disciplined play throughout his ﬁ  rst two 
seasons, Prather found his groove in March 
and was a key contributor during UF’s sec-ond consecutive Elite Eight run. 
  Prather hopes his strong ﬁ  nish last sea-son will carry over to this year. With Florida embracing a more defensive identity than in previous years, the athletic junior will likely see more minutes than the 9.5 he averaged per game in 2011-12. 
  “The one thing that is clear right from 
the get-go is we have incredible potential defensively,” coach Billy Donovan said. “You have Prather, who is a very, very good defender. Hopefully, after how he 
played last year, he’ll provide us with more this year.”
  Prather’s best 
performance as a Gator came only six days after UF’s SEC Tournament loss to Ken-tucky. 
  Providing a spark off the bench in 22 
turnover-free minutes, he recorded a ca-reer-best 14 points on 6-for-7 shooting in No. 7 seed Florida’s 71-45 win against No. 10 seed Virginia in the second round of the  Strong ﬁ  nish motivates juniorFIRE JOE MORGAN
  Dropped passes are the only thing 
keeping Jeff Driskel from making West Virginia’s Geno Smith green 
with envy . 
If not for his pass-catchers’ butterﬁ  n-
gers, Driskel would lead the nation in com-
pletion percentage. Nearly 30 percent of 
his incompletions have been drops. Florida 
has the worst passing offense in the South-
eastern Conference.
  The Gators average only 145 passing 
yards per game, and they have reached the 
end zone through the air just four times. In the past two games, Jeff Driskel has failed 
to eclipse the 100-yard mark.
  The struggles are understandable. 
Driskel is a ﬁ  rst-time starter under center, 
and running back Mike Gillislee has es-
tablished himself as one of the best in the 
country.
  If giving the rock to Gilly 30 times per 
game is working, why should Florida’s lack of a legiti-mate passing game be a con-
cern?
  Because one-
d i m e n s i o n a l 
teams — no 
matter how 
talented — are 
doomed to fail.
  Take last year’s LSU squad. The Tigers 
reached the BCS Championship Game 
with an elite defense and the second-best 
rushing offense in the Southeastern Con-ference.
  However, Alabama exposed LSU’s 
106th-ranked passing attack in New Or-
leans and dominated the SEC champions 
en route to its 14th national title.
  Along with an elite defense of its own, 
the Crimson Tide had the best rushing  Drops costly in Florida’s

UF coach
UF Bask etballNCAA Tournament.
Prather also excelled on the defensive 
end, compensating for the absence of 
then-sophomore forward Will Yeguete (fractured left foot). 
Prather drew two offensive fouls 
against Virginia’s leading scorer, Mike 
Scott, sending the big man to the bench 
with foul trouble in the first half.
“Obviously, I was struggling a little 
while, and [those] games were big for my 
confidence,” Prather said. “That’s a good 
start, good direction to go to.”
Prather joined Florida in 2010 as a 
four-star recruit ranked No. 71 in his class 
by Rivals.com. 
Before March 2012, Prather’s work eth-
ic in practice did not translate to results on the court. 
He averaged two points per game on 
36.7 percent shooting, the lowest clip for a Gator competing in at least 25 contests 
last season.  
In two years, he has averaged only 1.4 rebounds per game. Prather’s free-throw 
percentage (39.3 percent) was the second worst on the team in 2011-12. 
In addition, he had the most turnovers 
per minute on UF last year, surrendering 
the ball 21 times in 266 minutes. 
Prather was also one of Florida’s most 
foul-prone players, committing nearly 
seven fouls per 40 minutes on the floor. 
He drew the whistle 45 times last season. He dealt with similar turnover and 
foul issues during his freshman season. 
Prather attributes his past turnovers to 
poor decision-making and pacing. 
With the starting small forward spot 
still up for grabs, the junior is motivated 
to clean up his game.
“It would mean a lot (to start), but just 
playing means a lot,” Prather said. “What-
ever it takes to win, I’m happy.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2012

Competing in his first tournament since 
last year’s Gator Invitational, senior Tom-
my Mou has powered Florida into first 
place at the Jerry Pate National Intercolle-
giate in Vestavia Hills, Ala. 
The Bradenton native thrived on the 
fairways, carding a 68 (-2) in the open-
ing round of his fall debut. Mou strung 
together four birdies at the par-70, 7,204-yard course and is currently in a tie for first with Auburn’s Michael Johnson and 
Alabama’s Cory Whitsett.  
During Mou’s four years as a Gator, he 
has recorded only two top-10 finishes in 
addition to carding even or under par in 
just 12 of his 60 rounds. 
Florida recorded 282 (+2) in the open-
ing round of play. Because the tournament 
was delayed by fog, teams could not com-plete the second round before nightfall. 
Along with strong efforts from seniors 
T.J. Vogel and Tyler McCumber, the Gators hold a six-stroke lead among a competitive field that includes four teams ranked in the most recent Nike/Golf World Coaches’ Poll in addition to Florida. 
“We played solidly in the morning,” 
coach Buddy Alexander said. 
Both McCumber and 
Vogel turned in 71 (+1). Vogel birdied on holes 
16 and 17, regaining his 
footing after a sluggish start that included three 
bogeys. At the end of 
Round 1, the pair was 
tied for seventh with two 
other Southeastern Conference players — Alabama’s Bobby Wyatt and Mississippi State’s Alex Boasson. Sophomore J.D. Tomlinson finished the 
opening round in 72 strokes (+2) — good for an 11th-place tie, just one stroke behind 
McCumber and Vogel.
Freshman A.J. Crouch shot a 78 (+8) for 
the day.
Florida boasts four players inside the 
top 30 of the individual leaderboard, in-cluding three in the top 10 of the 60-player 
field. 
“Having five guys go out there and play 
well is exactly what you want,” Alexander 
said. 
The Gators will finish what is left of the 
second round Tuesday morning, followed 
by the third and final round of the tourna-ment.Senior off to unexpectedly hot start for Gators golf team

them along and helping them.”
In addition to producing in the offensive 
backfield, Bostic has also 
improved in pass cov-
erage. He has two pass breakups in 2012 after re-cording two last season.
“(He’s a) very instinc-
tive player,” Muschamp said. 
“He plays well in 
space. He covers well in space. I’m very 
pleased with his play to this point.”
Muschamp added that he was lucky to 
have a player like Bostic already on the ros-
ter when he took over at Florida. 
“You’re only as good as you are up the 
middle,” he said.

fense in the SEC last season. ‘Bama was balanced.
The Gators have been winning 
with a great defense and a powerful running game in 2012. But increased production from Driskel and the 
receiving corps is a must if Florida 
is to achieve its goal of playing for the SEC championship in Atlanta on Dec. 1.
Driskel certainly has room to 
improve as a passer. Checking the game replays, 20 of his 37 incomple-tions this season have either been underthrown, overthrown or tossed 
at a defender.
But the pass-catchers are also to 
blame for the struggles. Of Driskel’s 
37 incomplete passes this season, 11 
have been catchable throws.Driskel missed out on another 
completion when Quinton Dunbar simply fell down on a wide-open 
route against Bowling Green.
For our purposes, a catchable 
pass is one that hits a receiver in the hands. You can’t get much more ac-
curate than hitting a man’s palms 
with the football.
Granted, some tosses from 
Driskel may have a little more mus-
tard on them than others, but Divi-
sion-I receivers wearing state-of-the-art gloves should not be dropping as many passes as Florida’s pass-catch-ers — er, droppers are this season.
The Gators are averaging nearly 
two drops per game. In Florida’s past three contests, seven passes have hit fingers, then grass.
Through six games this season, 
the Gators’ 11 dropped passes have cost Driskel at least 132 yards and two touchdowns. Had the drops not occurred, Driskel would lead the na-tion with a 76.6 percent completion 
rate.
Frankie Hammond Jr., who UF 
coaches have praised as the team’s 
most consistent wide receiver, has dropped four passes. Jordan Reed 
and Trey Burton have two each. 
No wide receiver is immune to 
drops. To err is human, and the last 
time I checked, Calvin Johnson is 
the only known robot playing wide 
receiver.
Florida is a serious national cham-
pionship contender this season. The No. 2 spot in the BCS standings is a 
big deal, no matter what coach Will 
Muschamp and the players say.
However, in order to turn 6-0 
into 12-0, and maybe even 14-0, the 
Gators receivers need to quit drop-
ping the ball — literally.

Florida women’s basketball as-
sistant David Lowery sat in his of-
fice, typing at his desk.
Behind him, Vicky McIntyre crept 
in. At 6 feet, 6 inches, she towered 
over him, and before he could sense 
what was coming, she wrapped her arms around his neck and put him 
in a playful chokehold.
“Her arms are so freaking long,” 
Lowery said. “All I saw was this 
arm, and I was like ‘Oh, God!’ I got up and almost ran out of the room.”
McIntyre, from Omaha, Neb., 
just laughed. “Coach, I got you,” she crowed in her Midwestern accent.  
The two have developed a spe-
cial relationship, one that has helped ease McIntyre’s pain since she trans-ferred to Florida last May. Lowery, known for his perpetual jumpi-ness, is often on the receiving end of McIntyre’s pranks.
“I’ve caught on to her game,” 
Lowery said. “I’ve got my ears lis-tening, because I’m not trying to play that no more.”
As he said it, he began to smile. 
It’s clear how important she is to 
him. It’s clear how important having 
her smile again is.
He knows how difficult her situ-
ation has been. He knows what she has endured.

Nov . 17, 2011, was a Thursday . 
Four days earlier, Oklahoma 
State won its first game of the sea-
son, beating Rice. The team was preparing for a game against Gram-bling State that Saturday.
They never played the game. 
Tragedy changed everything.
The team was scheduled for a 
normal Friday . Practice at 3 p.m. and a film session to prepare for the weekend’s games.
Instead, McIntyre awoke early 
in the morning to the sound of her roommate telling her they had been called in. 
The players gathered in the lock-
er room, anxious to learn why the coaches called the impromptu meet-ing. An assistant, Jim Littell, was waiting for them.
It was about coach Kurt Budke 
and assistant Miranda Serna. The two were on a recruiting trip. 
They never made it to their des-
tination. 
Both were killed when their sin-
gle-engine plane went down about 45 miles west of Little Rock, Ark. Pi-lot and former Oklahoma state sena-tor Olin Branstetter and his wife, 
Paula, also died in the crash.
Budke was 50. Serna was 36. 
“There wasn’t a whole lot of 
speaking,” McIntyre said, remem-bering back to the few minutes she spent in the locker room that felt like eternity. “There was mostly crying.”
McIntyre had never experienced 
a loss like that. Budke was a father 
figure. As the lone female on the 
coaching staff, Serna had a unique connection with the players.
Suddenly, they were gone.“It didn’t really sink in all too 
much,” McIntyre said. “There were just moments when I was like ‘This isn’t real.’ Then you come home and it’s on ESPN.”
The coaches held a special place 
in McIntyre's heart. The losses were catastrophic. 
“It was total trauma,” said Pa-
mela McIntyre, Vicky’s mother. “We were in disbelief. She was pretty much an emotional wreck.”
Although Vicky flashed a smile 
when she returned to the court nine days later, the reprieve from anguish was fleeting. She struggled with her emotions the rest of the season. 
“It was weird, especially when 
we got back into the swing of really playing,” she said. “There’s some times in practice when you just can’t help but cry.”
She thought back to her first days 
at Oklahoma State and the two peo-ple who believed in her even when she didn’t believe in herself.
� � �
Vicky’s path to major college bas-
ketball started one night in Stillwa-
ter, Okla. She was in the car with her 
dad at a gas station that some of the locals called Cowboy Corner, wait-ing for a member of the Oklahoma State coaching staff to pick them up and show them around the campus. 
After waiting a few minutes, 
Vicky saw a white car pull up. Miranda Serna jumped out, rushed 
over and gave her a hug.
Coming out of Omaha, Neb., 
Marian High, Vicky garnered in-
terest from some northern Big 12 schools, but Oklahoma State was a step above. She was nervous, want-ing to make a good impression.
Seeing Vicky’s size, Serna envi-sioned her potential dominance. The two got along from the beginning.
After spending the evening visit-
ing the campus, the two stopped to chat before Vicky returned home. Right then, Serna won her over.
Vicky wasn’t confident she was 
talented enough to play for Oklaho-ma State. After more than an hour, Serna gave it to her straight. 
“Coach has this trust in you, this 
belief in you,” Serna told her. “You can do this. We can help you.” 
Later in the recruiting process, 
Budke and Serna traveled to the 
McIntyres’ home in Omaha.
Pamela remembers cooking a 
barbecue dinner with fried potatoes 
and green beans. She saved a home-made apple pie for dessert.
“This is how my mom used to 
make them,” Budke told Pamela. “This is the best recruiting dinner I have ever had.” 
The dinner marked Pamela’s 
first meeting with the coach who would become an integral part of her daughter’s life.
“He was like family to us,” Pa-
mela said. “He always made the time to come over and talk to us privately. He would kind of re-port to us how she was doing. 
That’s the kind of man he was.”  
� � �
Family has always come first 
for Vicky, whether it is her biologi-
cal family or her coaches and team-mates. She once had one at Oklaho-ma State, but it was no longer there. The situation had become too diffi-cult. She had to transfer. 
Gators coach Amanda Butler did 
not know much about Vicky , but she was immediately intrigued.
“Wait a minute, this cat is 6-foot-
6,” Butler thought. “This is worth investigating.”
The Florida coaching staff quick-
ly reached out to Vicky.
Shortly afterward, she was trav-
eling to Gainesville. Her visit went so well that before she left town, she had already canceled her other trips. This was her new family.
“I just knew I was supposed to be 
at Florida,” she said.
She talked it over with her par -
ents and Jim Seward — her personal coach since her sophomore year of high school. Vicky signed with the Gators in May.
“It is a perfect situation for 
Vicky ,” Seward said. “They really 
care for their players. 
The Gators begin the season at 
home against Fairfield on Nov . 9. 
When Vicky steps onto the floor, the 6-foot-6 center who Florida lists at 6 feet, 7 inches will be the tallest woman to ever play for UF. 
Though she has been adopted 
into the Florida family , she still has a 
place in her heart for the family she 
lost. Budke and Serna were the ones who first gave her a chance. She will never forget that.
“It’s always going to be trying to 
live out their legacy and make them proud and prove to the world what they thought was true,” McIntyre said. “I can do this.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Omar Hunter doesn’t care about the na-
tional attention that comes with the No. 2 
ranking in the BCS standings.
The defensive tackle didn’t even watch 
the rankings show, which ESPN aired on Sunday night.
“It’s whatever,” Hunter said. “That’s not 
going to get you to Atlanta or to the national championship. We’ve still got a lot more games to play, and that’s where we’re at right now.”Six regular season games remain for No. 
3 Florida before a potential appearance at the Southeastern Conference Championship Game in Atlanta on Dec. 1.
UF controls its own future with three 
conference games left to play, including matchups with SEC title contenders South Carolina and Georgia.
Florida has a one-game lead in the divi-
sion.
Three of its six remaining games are 
against teams currently ranked in the top 15 of the BCS standings. But the Gators have a more immediate goal.
The “one game at a time” adage was the 
message from the Gators on Monday. Coach Will Muschamp said his team has one goal in mind — beating No. 9 South Carolina on 
Saturday in The Swamp.
“Really nothing matters other than play-
ing South Carolina and preparing ourselves 
well throughout the week,” he said.
Both teams enter the game ranked in the 
top 10 for the first time ever in the series. For Florida, this is the highest BCS poll position since UF went undefeated through 12 games in 2009.
Florida is second behind top-ranked Ala-
bama. Oregon ranks third. 
Although the Gators may not say so, the 
ranking is something to be proud of for a 
team that finished 7-6 last season and wasn’t 
bowl eligible until it beat Furman 54-32 in its second to last game of the 2011 regular season.
“We don’t get too caught up in rankings, 
but we’re undefeated and we had a tough schedule,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “Rankings don’t matter until the end of the season, but we’re 6-0, and that’s what we 
look at. We can’t be any better than we are 
right now.”
Pittman iffy for South Carolina: Although 
at least 10 players left UF’s game against 
Vanderbilt on Saturday due to injury, only 
one is questionable for Saturday’s game against South Carolina.  
Freshman wide receiver Latroy Pittman 
suffered a right ankle injury last week while blocking for Omarius Hines in the second quarter on a play that began at the Vander -
bilt 2-yard line.
Pittman is questionable for Saturday, 
Muschamp said.
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins (hamstring) 
and offensive guard James Wilson (eye) didn’t play against the Commodores, but 
both are expected to be ready to go on Satur -
day, Muschamp said.
Jenkins suffered a fractured right thumb 
on Sept. 8 against Texas A&M and wore a cast the length of his right arm against LSU 
on Oct. 6 — his only game since the in-jury. Jenkins suffered the hamstring injury against LSU. 
“[The trainers] have modified [the cast] 
down a little bit, so it shouldn’t be as restric-tive as it has been,” Muschamp said. “He should be good.”
As for Wilson, the oft-injured redshirt 
senior suffered an eye injury last week in practice. 
Florida’s offensive line dealt with mul-
tiple injuries. Center Jonotthan Harrison in-
jured his elbow on Florida’s first drive, and 
left tackle Xavier Nixon exited the game in the second quarter due to an upper-body injury.
The combination of Sam Robey at cen-
ter, Ian Silberman at left guard and D.J. Humphries at left tackle paved the way for a record rushing game from Driskel.
“They did a nice job,” Muschamp said. 
“Vanderbilt gave us a lot of looks and a lot of movement up front, and I’m very pleased with how those guys progressed in the game.”
Defensive end Dominique Easley trav-
eled with the team to Nashville, Tenn., but didn’t suit up against the Commodores due to swelling in his right knee. The swelling first emerged against Tennessee on Sept. 15. 
Easley suffered an ACL tear in his left 
knee on Nov. 26, 2011 against Florida State.
