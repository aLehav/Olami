Chipley is a panhandle town 
with 3,766 residents and 11 police officers. 
For nearly his entire life, Andy 
Compton has called it home. He graduated from Chipley High in 1982, played baseball a half-hour away at Chipola College and ulti-mately returned to his alma mater to coach baseball, basketball and football. 
“It’s where I’ve always wanted to 
be,” he said.
Compton is in his 24th season as 
a baseball coach at Chipley and still has difficulty matching words to the best player he has ever coached.  
In 2007, sophomore pitcher 
Karsten Whitson came to Chipley from Bartow. His grandparents’ health was declining and his mother was from the area. 
His father, Kent, played col-
lege basketball at Chipola a n d roomed with Compton. 
“Karsten was not in 
favor of the move, but he understood why we need-ed to relocate,” Melissa Whitson said in an email. 
Bartow’s loss was 
Chipley’s treasure. Whitson stood out immediately, but he made his biggest stride his junior year after adding a slider to his repertoire, striking out 73 batters in 42.1 in-nings with a 1.49 ERA. After com-mitting to Florida and head coach Kevin O’Sullivan, his recruitment took on a more major-league feel. 
In August, the calls flooded into 
Chipley High from scouts wanting to know when and where Whitson would be pitching. 
Compton said as many as 30 
scouts would be at every game, forc-ing the school to clear out a section behind home plate to accommodate them. “It wouldn’t matter if we were 
here or on the road,” he said. 
“Wherever he pitched, they were 
there.”
In the 2010 Major League Base-
ball First-Year Player Draft, Whit-son was picked No. 9 overall by the San Diego Padres. 
  
By the signing deadline, Whit-
son’s contract offer reached $2.1 million. 
Median income for a household 
in Chipley is $21,686. Whitson’s mother teaches at Roulhac Middle School, and his father is self-em-ployed in the electrical business. 
The deadline passed without a 
deal, making Whitson just the fourth top-10 draft pick in the past 10 years to not sign his contract. 
Kendall Rogers, managing editor 
of baseball scouting service Perfect Game, said decisions like Whitson’s ultimately come down to family.
“In his situation, I think he fac-
tored it down to a Florida educa-tion,” Rogers said. “Obviously it surpassed what the Padres wanted to offer him.”
Right-handed pitcher Wade 
Townsend, a No. 8 pick in 2004, turned down the Baltimore Orioles before being drafted No. 8 by the Tampa Bay Rays the following year. Townsend’s minor-league run end-ed in 2010, and he is now a profes-sional poker player. 
Three picks before Whitson was 
taken in 2010, right-handed pitcher Barret Loux was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks but failed a physical and is now in Single-A for the Texas Rangers. Both pitched in college. 
Another top-10 pick, righty 
Aaron Crow turned down a deal in 2008 out of Missouri, but signed with Kansas City in 2009 after being drafted 12th. 
He is the only one so far to make 
it to the majors. 
Since 2001, 43 high school play-
ers have been drafted in the top 10 — only Whitson has decided against signing. 
His mother admitted it was 
tough to see her son bypass a chance at professional baseball. 
“He always says, ‘It wasn’t coach 
O’Sullivan’s job to entice him away from the Padres, it was the Padres’ job to entice him away from coach O’Sullivan and the UF program,’” his mom said.
  
Whitson was in class-
es at Florida one week after rejecting his MLB contract. 
Any regrets he may 
have had about not go-ing pro ended quickly. 
During the fall of his freshman year, he told Yahoo! Sports he was glad he chose Florida, say-
ing he “hardly could walk” after the first week of college workouts and may have not been ready for a pro-fessional regimen. 
But once spring came around, 
Whitson mended into Gainesville in spectacular fashion. He was im-mediately injected into the week-end rotation, serving as the Sunday follow-up to right-hander Hudson Randall and left-hander Brian John-son. 
For the Gators, the combination 
worked well. 
In his first year of college ball, Whitson was held to limited pitch counts by O’Sullivan. 
The use of Randall — who ranked 
third in the Southeastern Confer -
ence with 124.1 innings pitched — as a Friday night starter kept Flor -ida’s best relievers fresh to support Whitson. 
As a freshman, Whitson aver -
aged about five innings per start and went his deepest in a 6.2-inning out-ing against Alabama on April 24. 
“Sully was really protective of 
me last year, and I’m grateful for that,” Whitson said. 
While Whitson’s pitch counts 
were contained by O’Sullivan, his innings were often self-limited. 
Whitson, a strikeout pitcher, 
tended to rely too much on his fast-ball as an out pitch and let batters consistently take him deep into counts. 
He finished fifth in the SEC in 
strikeouts (92) and sixth in ERA (2.40) but was angered at times by early exits from games.
“You could tell in the dugout 
when they would take him out of a game, he was frustrated,” Compton said. “He’s a guy that really wants to go.”
Regardless, Whitson’s freshman 
year was an overwhelming suc-cess. He was named a Freshman All-American by Baseball America, and Perfect Game named him the National Freshman Pitcher of the Year. He finished 8-1, surrendering just a .235 batting average to oppos-ing hitters. 
“You look at the developing he’s 
already done under Sully both phys-ically and mentally,” Rogers said. “He’s become a better pitcher.”
  
Whitson is no longer the 19-year-
old known solely for spurning a $2.1 million opportunity. 
Now a sophomore, he will be fac-
ing an expanded role in 2012.
Most noticeably, he will be 
moved from Sunday starter to Sat-urday starter and will see his work load increase. 
“He’s got one year under his 
belt,” Randall said. 
“That’s a huge year to have un-
der your belt. 
“He’s just going to have more ex-
perience, learning how to hold run-ners better, get deeper into games hopefully.”O’Sullivan feels that Whitson’s 
greatest strides will come in the us-age of his secondary pitches. 
If he can learn to better control 
his slider and rely less on his fast-ball, it will only make the scouts drool more. 
“He looks a little more comfort-
able,” Johnson said. 
“You don’t have to worry about 
the freshman thing. You know what’s coming and you know what to expect.”
At Saturday’s scrimmage, Whit-
son made a lone mistake when he allowed senior right fielder Preston Tucker to deposit a ball past the McKethan Stadium visitor’s bullpen in right-center field. 
Whitson recovered to strike out 
the side, notching three of his six punch-outs on the day. He threw 68 pitches to complete the five in-nings. 
During the 2011 regular season, 
Whitson pitched five innings or fewer nine times and averaged 78.3 pitches. 
“I try not to put too many expec-
tations on him,” O’Sullivan said. “He’s got his own expectations. … He’s in a good place right now.”
When Whitson decided against 
signing his contract in 2010, it was easy to question what there was to gain. 
For those closest to him, the deci-
sion is no mystery. 
Whitson would like to be a le-
gitimate four-pitch guy when he re-enters the draft. 
He wants to iron out any possible 
maturity issues, a common byprod-uct of three or four years of living on your own. 
He would like a faster road to 
the majors, something high school pitchers don’t typically get. 
He doesn’t want to be No. 9 after 
his junior season. 
He wants to be the best. Rogers sees that happening. “He has all the natural tools; he 
has all the mechanical tools,” Rog-ers said. “He’s a freak athlete. He’s a freak pitcher.”
“Obviously, he’s going to be a 
very good prospect next year, prob-ably No. 1 overall.”Editor Matt Watts     Assistant Editor John Boothe        Cover Illustration Dana Burke and Matt Watts

 Gators freshman tight end A.C. Leonard 
has been suspended indeﬁ  nitely after he was 
arrested Wednesday night on charges of phys-ically abusing his longtime girlfriend.
  During an altercation, Leonard pushed her 
to the ground, pulled her hair and dragged her out of their apartment by her feet before locking the door at the Polos Complex on Wil-liston Road, according to an arrest report.
Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers arrested Leonard 
around 9:15 p.m. during a tutoring session at Farrior Hall. He was charged with domestic 
battery, a misdemeanor.
  Leonard’s girlfriend, Nia 
V. Ruiz, told ofﬁ  cers her head landed on a dog cage when he shoved her down. She also said he ripped out some of her hair and broke a necklace she was wearing.
  Ruiz had a large red abra-
sion on her left forearm and a quarter-sized one on her right elbow, probably because she was dragged across the carpet, according to police.
  After getting locked out, Ruiz went to a 
neighbor’s apartment and called 911. Leon-ard, 20, and Ruiz, 21, have been dating for 17 months and started living together in January.
  “I never hit her,” Leonard told ofﬁ  cers after 
he was arrested. “I just wanted her to leave.”
  Wednesday’s incident was not Leonard’s 
ﬁ  rst  display of violence. 
As a senior at Jacksonville University 
Christian School, Leonard was suspended by the Florida High School Athletic Association for six weeks after he took a swing at an op-posing player during a game against Jackson-ville Episcopal High in October 2010. It was reportedly the second episode Leonard was involved in that season. Football player

  A man died when a car crashed into him on Interstate 75 
Thursday afternoon while he was ﬁ  xing his engine.
  A Florida Highway Patrol report gave this account:
  Harry Benjamin Young Jr., 57, died on I-75 in Marion County 
after he pulled to the side of the southbound lane and got out of his Volkswagen Beetle. The Summerﬁ  eld man was working on the engine of his car when a Chevrolet Silverado sped toward him.
  The driver, 56-year-old Ernest Ray Pinkard, of Ocala, started swerving when he had a “medical emergency,” according to the report. He weaved back and forth between the lanes.
  Pinkard drove off the road and into the west emergency lane 
— directly in the path of Young’s car.
  He slammed into Young and hit the back of the Beetle. The 
crash jolted the Beetle onto the right lane of I-75, and the Silvera-do stopped in the emergency lane.
  Young was declared dead on the scene when Marion County 
Fire Rescue ofﬁ  cials arrived.
  Pinkard had minor injuries and was taken to Munroe Region-
al Medical Center.
  Charges in the incident are pending.  Man killed by swerving car on I-75

  As UF students ﬂ  ooded the Florida 
Capitol to meet with legislators, a state Senate committee passed a bill that 
would allow UF to charge higher tuition than other state universities.
  The Senate Higher Education commit-
tee unanimously passed a measure on Thursday that would allow Florida uni-versities to seek tution increases beyond 15 percent if they meet 11 of 14 require-ments.
  UF President Bernie Machen has been pushing the issue of higher tuition as a way for UF to continue to succeed in the global arena.

Krissy Wilson’s blog could be 
called a collection of mistakes.
It features black-and-white pho-
tos interrupted by neon stripes, 
doodles in book margins and maps folded to create nonexistent places.
She calls it art.The 22-year-old English senior 
created The Art of Google Books, a Tumblr with about 800 posts of Google Book anomalies.
She seeks signs of use — writ-
ing in margins, water damage, dog-eared pages, etc. — and aspects of digitization, meaning images that capture details like the fingers of the employee who scanned the page.
Wilson’s blog has been featured 
by PBS NewsHour, Wired.com and Boing Boing, among others. She has about 15,500 Tumblr followers, including the New York Public Li-brary and LIFE.
Wilson was volunteering in the 
Baldwin Library of Historical Chil-dren’s Literature last year when she noticed papers pasted into book bindings. These scraps, called binder’s waste, are often misprinted pages or handwritten sheets.
She started trying to match these papers to real books. She’d string the legible words into phrases and search them on Google Books, find-ing oddities along the way.
“There were all of these interest-
ing anomalies that I started to pick up on,” she said.
A printed portrait had been 
scanned through protective tissue, producing a ghostly image. Wilson liked it, so she put it in a folder on her computer’s desktop.“As I kept doing my research, 
more things got added to the desk-top folder,” she said.
Wilson decided to use Tumblr to 
create a database of her findings. She posts at least twice a day.“I enjoy it as an aesthetic gallery ,” 
Wilson said. “That was the original intention — to stand alone as some-thing that’s attractive to the biblio-phile, to the artist, to the techie.”
Wilson has a “touchy” relation-
ship with Google, she said. Some Google Books engineers thought the blog was cool, but other employees felt she was pointing out errors in the scanning process. If pages are folded in a book, the worker often does not unfold them when scan-ning. This creates spliced pictures of hybrid animals, odd diagrams and maps of places that do not exist.
Wilson’s blog displays these, 
showing the uneasy transition from print to digital form, said UF as-sociate professor of English Terry Harpold. She will collaborate with Harpold’s hypermedia class for a Google Books hunting project. The project will be 10 percent of students’ grades, according to its syllabus.
“Krissy has played the role of 
someone both documenting errors and glitches in the transition, but also pointing out that those errors and glitches have a kind of poetry to them,” he said.
The Reitz Union’s art gallery will 
feature The Art of Google Books from March 15 to April 3.
“She’s captured how arresting 
some of these images are,” Harpold said. “They have a strange kind of beauty to them.”

Residents will no longer need to travel far to grab a 
mimosa after church on Sundays.
The Gainesville City Commission voted unanimously 
on Thursday to amend an ordinance that forbids places of 
religious assembly and bars to be within 300 feet of each another.
The city previously required bars to be more than 300 
feet from places of religious assembly and 400 feet from private and public schools. With the newly amended or -
dinance, this rule will not apply to the central city district and the tourist-oriented district. The spacing requirement will continue to apply everywhere else in the city.
The central city district, located downtown, is bordered 
by Northwest and Southwest Sixth streets and Northeast and Southeast Third streets. It encompasses Bo Diddley Community Plaza, the Hippodrome State Theatre and multiple restaurants and bars.
The tourist-oriented district refers to a small area on 
Southwest 13th Street lined with hotels and motels about two miles past Archer Road.
There are no private or public schools located in either 
of the districts. There are no establishments serving alco-hol or places of religious assembly located in the tourist-oriented district.
The commission decided to discuss amending the or -dinance after a church, The Rock of Gainesville, opened downtown on South Main Street at the former site of Hap-py Hour Billiards.
Downtown business owners were worried about the 
spacing requirement when the church opened in 2011, ac-cording to a city document about the change.
A rector of a church in downtown Gainesville told the 
Alligator in early January that as long as no problems arise as a result of lewd behavior, she would be fine with the new ordinance.
“I’m not going to say I’d love to have a bar right next 
to us,” said the Rev. Louanne Loch, rector at Holy Trinity Episcopal Church. “But we haven’t had a problem with any of them in the past.” Ordinance allows downtown bars to operate near churches4, ALLIGATOR   FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2012

  Sitting in front of her con-
crete-block house Thursday afternoon, a pregnant Shardae D. Wells looked away and, for a moment, hid her black eye.
  On Wednesday, Gainesville 
Police arrested Jeremy P . De-lapierre, 25, the father of her two children. He was charged with aggravated battery and domestic battery by strangula-tion.
  Delapierre’s mother, Clara 
M. Young, and cousins, Jim-mie L. Hart and Nathail G. Harrington, were also booked on aggravated battery charg-es. All four remained at Ala-chua County Jail on Thursday night.
  The problems started when 
Wells visited her mother at the Carver Gardens Apartments, where Delapierre and his fami-ly also live. The couple stood at the entrance of the complex on SE 15th Street, and Delapierre accused Wells, 26, of inﬁ  delity. They argued. He grabbed her throat, breaking her necklace.
  When GPD ofﬁ  cers chased 
Delapierre into an apartment, his family members attacked Wells, according to an arrest report. After Young swung and missed, Wells pulled the 48-year-old woman to the ground and sat on her.
  Harrington then hit Wells 
in the left eye. As Wells lay on the ground, Hart repeatedly kicked her, according to police. Wells remained curled into a ball, using her head and limbs to protect her stomach.
  Thursday afternoon, Wells 
said she is seven weeks preg-nant, and Delapierre is the fa-ther.
  “I’m really hurt because we’ve been together for nine years,” Wells said. “I would never let my family jump him. I know I said I would, but I won’t. I won’t. I won’t. But there ain’t no love. He ain’t never gonna see his kids no more. No, sir.”
  Wells’ aunt, Arnethen S. 
Johnson, was also at the apart-ment complex Wednesday. She received a call and learned that the police were outside with Wells and Delapierre. When she arrived, Wells’ neck was bleeding.
  After ofﬁ  cers found Delapi-
erre hiding in a bathroom, they came back outside, saw the beating and arrested the three family members, according to police. Paramedics then drove Wells to Shands at UF.
  “She couldn’t even stand up 
or nothing,” Johnson said. “She was dizzy. She was coughing 
up blood.”
  W e l l s ’ 
left eye was swollen shut T h u r s d a y, marked by a dark purple circle about three inches in diameter.
  Her neck and right arm 
were also cut, and she said the left side of her nose is frac-tured. It hurts to sneeze.
    Wells was arrested for sim-
ple battery in 2004, and she said the Florida Department of Children and Families won’t allow her and Delapierre to be around their kids at the same time.
    “I will never forget this,” 
she said. “I respect my baby daddy, but now I see: There is nothing between us. We got nothing in common. I just can’t do it no more.”

  A recent ranking suggest look-
ing for love is easier in Gainesville 
than in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
  The Daily Beast named 
Gainesville the second best city to ﬁ  nd a date in 2012.
  Rankings were based on three 
factors: available singles, dating costs and mental and physical health. 
The ﬁ  nal calculation also in-
cluded Google trends results measuring the popularity of dat-ing sites in each city.
  Research showed 73 percent 
of men and 75 percent of women in Gainesville are single. The me-dian salary for a single person is $20,863 and the average movie ticket costs $8.86.
  Gainesville may be high on the 
list, but some students disagree with the website’s ranking.
  Will Smith, a 22-year-old food 
and resource economics senior, said the results of the data have nothing to do with the dating pool in Gainesville.
  “Gainesville is the worst place 
to ﬁ  nd a date, but the best place to hook up,” Smith said. “When I say hook up, that doesn’t mean bringing the girl on a date ﬁ  rst.”

BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Writer
The largest potential change to 
the Florida prison system failed 
to pass in the Florida Senate this week, but opponents to the bill are concerned that the fight isn’t over.
A state bill, which was in-
troduced to the Senate on Jan. 20, was aimed at privatizing the state’s prisons. It received only 19 of 21 votes.
If the bill had been approved, the Corrections Corporation of America would have been in charge of Florida’s prisons rather than local governments.
“This is a top priority of Gov. 
Rick Scott, and it was an attempt to give our taxpayer money to his corporate bankers,” said David Bergstein, spokesman for the Flor -
ida Democratic Party. “Democrats and Republicans came together to defeat this bill, which would have posed a threat to Florida’s econo-my and rural economy across the state.”Since there is a chance the bill 
could come back, the debate isn’t over, said Jeff McAdams, presi-dent of the Alachua County Fra-ternal Order of Police lodge.
“Until the session is over, it 
isn’t a done deal,” he said.
He said the bill is a bad policy 
for Florida because it could lead to looser safety measures that could lead to an inmate breakout.
The introduction of the bill 
means state prisons may have a reduced budget next year, McAd-ams said.McAdams said the Corrections 
Corporation of America promised to save the state 7.5 percent of its prisons budget for the next fiscal year. The state Senate is still con-sidering cutting that 7.5 percent because it was not planning to pay that cost, he said.
Cutting the budget even more 
in an economic downturn would put the police force in a worse place than it already is, he said.
“Crime goes up when the econ-
omy goes down,” McAdams said. “Our community was hit hard by the economic recession, but with qualified prison staff, we can come back.”
If a prison has less money, he 
said, it has to settle for a less-qual-ified staff, which also increases the chances of an inmate breakout.
“We have a number of correc-
tional facilities within arms’ reach of the UF campus,” McAdams said. “I don’t want inmates prey-ing on students.”
Sen. John Thrasher, who sup-
ported the bill, did not return calls requesting comment.

Next week, students will be voting in Student Govern-

8:30 p.m.
And you will likely be harassed by at least one member of 
one party on your way to class at some point next week — if you haven’t already.
We encourage you to pay attention to the issues and make 
your voice heard. The Students Party has our vote, but we want you to look at arguments from both sides so you can make an informed decision. That leads us to this week’s non-sequitor edition of...
Darts & Laurels
First up, we throw a voyeurism-will-always-be-gross-
and-weird DART at creepy cops. A former GPD officer is be-
ing sued for “allegations related to the secret videotaping of 
several women, some of whom were naked while they were filmed,” according to Thursday’s article.
Someone should tell this cop about the Internet, where he 
can be creepy in the privacy of his own home.
Next, we give a model-for-the-nation LAUREL  to the state 
of Washington for legalizing same-sex marriage.
Yes, this has been a topic for the last few issues, but it 
should be.
For being great representatives of the Gainesville, we throw 
a because-of-your-ignorance-and-intolerance-you-will-not-be-tolerated-anywhere DART at the two Gainesville High 
School girls who posted an incredibly racist and offensive rant to YouTube. Despite their ignorance, we do hope that threats of violence remain just that.
In more uplifting news, we give a giving-a-good-night-
sleep-to-those-who-need-it-most LAUREL  to Tempur-Pedic, 
which recently donated 51 beds to the Ronald McDonald House.
The charity provides temporary housing to families with 
critically ill children receiving treatment at Gainesville hospi-tals. These beds will probably do wonders for the stress they must be experiencing.
For our final gift of shame, we toss a this-is-seriously-still-
a-problem DART at hazing. There have been two reports of 
possible hazings that have occurred in the past few years. This should not be happening, and let’s hope that whichever party is chosen next week will deal with this unnecessary problem in its upcoming administrations.
Members of SG, with their ties to Greek life, should be the 
most outspoken opponents of this nonsense.
Finally, we have to give a congratulations-and-welcome-
to-The-Gator-Nation LAUREL  to the nearly 11,700 students 
who received acceptance letters to UF.
There must have been a lot of happy people the day the 
acceptance letters went out. If you decide to come to UF, we want to welcome you to the community!
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.People should appreciate everyday life
Our culture has shifted, and we value athletes and 
celebrities instead of inventors and writers. We care about the clothing people wear or the weight 
of others because we’ve been programmed to do so by the imagination-sucking, dementor-like kiss of death that is society. Ever seen “Wall-E”? We are headed down the path of apathy, impersonality and group-think, just like the humans aboard the Axiom.
Society brainwashed us into holding certain beliefs, 
most of them negative. We don’t believe in our politi-cal process. We don’t believe in our education system. We don’t even believe in ourselves anymore because society points out everyone’s flaws. Women attempt to uphold unrealistic beauty standards, just as men spend excessive time in the gym to beef up because society tells them to. We’ve been “Pavlov’d” into drooling over the new iPhone release, and the list goes on.
If you get anything from my rant, get this: unthink 
what is happening around you. Don’t be conned into the lull that “reality TV” society is forcing upon you. Don’t be so brainwashed into your routines that your life pass-es you by.
My favorite phrase  is “carpe diem.” Today, it means 
“seize the day,” but in ancient Rome, it meant something to the effect of “let me enjoy life now because I may be dead tomorrow.” The most important questions you may ask yourself are, “Who am I?” and “Why am I here?”
Think about all the events that led to this moment. 
Not just the events that lead you to this column, but the ones that lead to your very existence.
Billions of years, ago the Big Bang occurred, and even-
tually everything cooled enough for atoms to form and stabilize. These swirls of atoms, due to gravity, eventu-ally condensed into stars. Those atoms formed heavier atoms, which condensed to form planets and other mat-ter.
Consider how special Earth is: It revolves around a large star that isn’t too close to scorch the planet, yet isn’t too far to leave it cold. Earth exists in what is known as the “Goldilocks Zone,” where tem-perature is just stable enough to support life.
Through geologic processes, 
water formed on our planet with many other molecules. Accord-
ing to Miller and Urey, this “primordial soup” gave rise to organic molecules when lightning struck the broth of life. Organic molecules self-assembled into membranes, which eventually lead to cells. Some cells began working together with other cells and gave rise to eukaryotes.
The eukaryotes then teamed up to form systems and, 
later, more complex lifeforms. Some life fed on the en-ergy from the sun, while others fed on energy from other organisms. These organisms, over time, became more complex until one day, some exited the primordial soup and “stepped” onto land.
On land, plants developed, organisms evolved and 
ecosystems were formed. Asteroids struck the earth, one of which wiped out the dinosaurs. Humans, millions of years later evolved from monkeys.
Eventually humans banded together, formed civiliza-
tions, built the pyramids, pondered life’s mysteries and sent people to the moon. Humans fought bloody wars, killing young men who would have otherwise been fa-thers.
You are privileged to have this moment, but as a so-
ciety we don’t appreciate it. We don’t understand how special we truly are, especially us Americans. Instead, we complain. We choose to squander our limited time on insignificant affairs.

Letter to the Editor
Student Body president has been sub-
ject of baseless attacks
The highly critical responses to a recent 
letter written by the Student Body president 
are extremely biased and one-sided. With elections coming up fast, we have seen in-creases in these baseless attacks, especially in response to a recent letter written by the Student Body president, in which he ex-plains the stance and reasoning behind his decision on HJR931 and SJR1508.
Reynolds clearly and articulately stated 
that his intentions will largely benefit the UF and FSU student bodies.
This claim has been made on numerous 
other smaller college campuses.
To say that our Student Body president 
fails to meet the needs of the UF students and further condemn his clearly informa-tive letter as “confusing” and “enraging,” one must question the writer of these re-sponses and his motives.
Reynolds’ decision in Tallahassee, a 
move that clearly favors UF students above all other state colleges and universities in the state, is already proof enough that our Student Body president serves the best in-terests of UF students, despite overwhelm-ing odds.
The open transparency and willingness 
to further explain his actions to the Student Body shows he has nothing to hide.
In Reynolds’ short tenure as both vice 
president and president, much restructur -
ing work has gone into the SG cabinet, block tuition was successfully averted and overall spending within SG was scrutinized and reduced or eliminated.
While I agree that much work is still needed, Reynolds has done an excellent job serving the Student Body.
It is easy to get caught up in the politi-
cal bashing, biased insults and false accu-sations that are characteristic of every elec-tion season. 
However, we should not forget, belittle 
and deny the enormous contributions that the SG leaders have accomplished in their short tenure for the benefit of The Gator Nation.

UF alumnus
Like most UF students with a cellphone, I received alerts 
about the “strong-arm robbery” of a fellow student last week. 
I read the next day how some were offended by the pho-
tograph of the suspect being arrested on the front page of the 
Alligator, and I couldn’t help but chuckle in amazed amuse-ment. Or is it amused amazement? Hard to tell.
The fact is, people, if you stopped allowing yourselves to be 
victims, you wouldn’t be one. If you simply refuse to be a vic-
tim, it is impossible to become one. For all of the young women who walk dark streets with their keys between their knuckles in fear of the attacker in the shadows, and for all the young men who talk tough at the pub but end up getting rolled in the street for their things, I have only one thing to say: Time to evolve.
Put yourself in the predator’s shoes. Learn to understand 
the predator’s mentality. In nature, there’s a very fine line be-tween predator and prey. Why would the average street ver -
min be any different? They’re not.
I was incredibly blessed during my formative years to par -
ticipate in a cage-diving expedition with large pelagic sharks off the west coast with the Hydrosphere Group. In nature, there are few creatures as awe-inspiring as a white shark. These brutes are often 6-feet thick. The girth of these monsters is so-bering like nothing I’ve ever experienced.And yet, they are cautious, oppor -
tunistic ambush predators with barely any edge over their prey . If the shark had any idea that it could easily come in and cut a diver in half, there would 
be no “Shark Week.” The same goes for African lions, jihadi fighters and the average street-thug punk. If I had to weigh ev-ery experience I’ve had with the more opportunistically violent side of life, the only group I’ve ever had to deal with that defied this balance was one of suicide-vest wearing jihadis, who were on a mission to “paradise.” They were easy to zero in on and dispatch outside of the killzone with a little basic Marine Corps marksmanship. Semper Fi.
But since this isn’t often an option out on University Av-
enue, let me propose a different mode of thinking. Not a differ -
ent mode of behavior, because it’s not for you to change your behavior — it’s for the predators.
Step 1: Fight back! Make yourself as big, loud and angry as 
possible if attacked. This means scream, kick, punch, bite and chase. From the moment your safety is in danger, write it off as lost and attempt to inflict the same loss on your attacker. Predators are nervous, cagey and only barely in control. Chal-lenge this balance and the panic you will induce will amaze you. Trust me.Step 2: Wise up. Know your surroundings. Don’t invite a 
challenge, but don’t cower from one, either. Signal to all around that you’re not prey. It’s a mentality that’s easy to read, and will likely get you to safety when the wolf catches your scent.
Step 3: Use what you have. Remember your physics lessons, 
kids. Look at the palm of your hand. Now trace your pinky fin-ger down to your inner wrist. Flex your hand back and feel that bone right there. That’s your tomahawk, boys and girls. De-liver that bone in a downward chop to an attacker, especially to the top of the skull. After you watch them go down like a ton of bricks, you will have plenty of time to call in the cavalry.
Gainesville is not a nice place. UF life may lead you to be-
lieve that things are all fair, collegial and awarding of merit, earnestness and excellence. Get real. You are a target, but you don’t have to be a victim. Gird your loins, take every advantage and relieve yourself of any illusions of fairness out here on the streets. As they say of starstruck newcomers in Las Vegas, New York City, the entire state of California and basically anywhere else where a good deal of money is made from outsiders, just like here, “In the world of wolves, we welcome all sheep.”
No bleating. No retreating. You can do this.Joshua Fonzi is a microbiology and cell science and entomology

Speaking Outkeep this in mind,” he said.
At a Board of Governors meeting in 
December, Machen stressed that UF is 
different from the other 10 schools in the state university system and should be treated accordingly.
Although he said he is averse to plac-
ing undue financial burden on students, UF needs to look for more funding that doesn’t come from the state. 
If the bill passes, Machen wrote in an 
email, it would allow UF to compete at national and international levels.
An amendment to SB1752 contains 
the 14 criteria for allowing universities to raise tuition. UF is expected to be eli-gible to pursue the increases.
Some of the criteria include an aver -
age weighted GPA of 3.8 or higher and a top 50 ranking on at least two well-
known and respect-ed national public university rankings.  Students with Florida Prepaid college plans would be exempt from the tuition in-crease.
The increases 
would have to be ap-
proved by UF’s Board of Trustees, then passed to the Board of Governors, the highest governing body of the state uni-versity system.

A leading council on environ-
mental design recognized the 
first green county fire rescue sta-tion in Florida.
Alachua County Fire Rescue 
Station No. 10 was honored at Tuesday’s Alachua County Com-mission meeting for being a Lead-ership in Energy and Environ-mental Design-certified building. It was certified in September by the United States Green Building Council.
The county facility depart-
ment presented the commission with the station’s certification plaque Tuesday. 
The plaque, which will hang 
on the front of the building, names the station as the first LEED-certified fire rescue station in Florida.
After the original building de-
sign was drafted in 2008, the Ala-chua County Commission had the station redesigned to meet national green and sustainable standards. 
It was completed in 2009.In order to become certified, 
buildings must meet certain guidelines. 
Guidelines include reduc-
ing water use, using technology in bathrooms that cuts down on waste water and using energy-efficient heating, cooling and lighting systems inside the build-ing, according to the U.S. Green Building Council website.
The fire rescue station fea-
tures a solar heating system that will save 70 percent in hot water costs, said Charlie Jackson, Ala-chua County facilities manager. Waterless urinals will save 7,500 gallons of water annually. The site also features a rainwater har -
vesting system that will provide more efficient irrigation.
The fire rescue station is the 
only county building that is LEED-certified, Jackson said. Three other county buildings are registered and waiting for certifi-cation from the U.S. Green Build-ing Council.County’s green fire rescue station named Florida’s first

Daniel Landesberg has been an active mem-
ber of UF’s Jewish community since his fresh-
man year, and he has tried to go to Israel twice.
This May, the 19-year-old telecommunica-
tion sophomore will experience Birthright, a free 10-day Israel trip for Jewish students, on UF Hillel’s largest trip yet.
“I’m really excited for the opportunity to 
experience something that I’ve been learning about for so long,” he said.
About 190 UF students registered through 
UF Hillel as of Thursday for the Taglit-Birth-right Israel trip. The largest trip before was in 2011 with 160 students.
UF Hillel teamed with Birthright organiza-
tion Israel Experts. The groups hope to take 300 students this summer.
“The demand is greater than we’ve ever seen,” said Joshua Kahn, the Jewish agency program director at Hillel.
A record number of students applied by 
Wednesday, the first registration day. UF Hil-lel usually sends about 85 percent of applicants, he said. Registration will end once 300 students have signed up.
“Originally , Israel funded 25 percent of the 
trip,” he said. “But it is now funding 50 percent of the trip, allowing us to give out more seats than in previous years.”
Sending one person to Israel costs about 
$3,000, Kahn said. The trip is free, other than a $250 security deposit, which is refunded at the end of the trip.Free Israel trip in high demandAlex Catalano / Alligator s taff
The Alachua County Fire Rescue Station, located at 930 SE Fifth St., is now LEED-certified. It is the

A UF student faces a criminal charge 
after he slapped another student in the 
face outside the Swamp Restaurant on Thursday morning.   
According to a Gainesville Police De-
partment arrest report, John Michael Pe-terson, 22, was arrested at 1:50 a.m. after he slapped Andrew Bacha, 20.
Peterson said he saw Bacha talking to 
one of Peterson’s ex-girlfriends. 
He told officers, “Boys will be boys, 
and I slapped him.”
Bacha said he and a friend recalled the 
night differently.
“There were no girls around us,”  said 
Bacha, an applied physiology and kinesi-ology sophomore.
Swamp bouncer James Healy, 21, a 
friend of Bacha’s and a UF psychology senior, said Peterson tried to walk into the restaurant after Healy told him it was closed.  Healy said Peterson was drunk.
Healy said Peterson became agitated, 
cursed at Healy and harassed a nearby group, which included Bacha. Peterson tried to start a fight with the 
strangers. He finally singled out Bacha, the smallest of the group, Healy said.
“I want him,” Peterson said, pointing 
to Bacha.
When Bacha refused to fight, Peterson 
slapped him across the face, leaving a red mark, Bacha and Healy said.
Healy said he grabbed Peterson in a 
headlock and waved two officers over for assistance. 
Peterson managed to free himself and 
escaped from the scene.
“He bitch-slapped me and took off like 
a little punk,” Bacha said.   
Police caught Peterson nearby and ar -
rested him, according to the report.
Bacha said he’s still angry and con-
fused by the situation.    
“I would not be in a good state of mind 
if I saw him again,” Bacha said. “Who hits someone and then sprints away?”

Hudson Randall can’t remem-
ber what it’s like to pitch against 
hitters other than his teammates. 
For the better part of the past 
five months, No. 1 Florida’s Fri-day night starter has squared off against the likes of Daniel Pigott, Preston Tucker and Mike Zunino in intrasquad scrimmages. 
Replacing Florida’s powerful 
lineup tonight at 7 will be a com-plete contrast, a No. 25 Cal State Fullerton team that makes up for a lack of power with speed and a knack for taking chances on the basepaths. 
Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
has taken note and began prepar -
ing his team for a style typically not seen at McKethan Stadium. 
“Sully has been implementing 
it in the scrimmages so far, espe-cially in the last three or four,” Randall said. 
“He’s been hitting-and-run-
ning a lot of the guys and getting us ready for it. 
The Titans will try to keep 
UF’s pitchers and infielders as busy as possible. 
In 2011, Cal State Fullerton 
was either first or second in the Big West Conference in nearly every major offensive statistic ca-tering to the small-ball approach of West Coast baseball. 
The Titans had a team on-base 
percentage of .375, allowing them to get runners in position to pull off their ultimate game plan. Ful-lerton led the Big West in sacrifice bunts (79), sacrifice flies (32) and steals (98), attempting to swipe 59 more bases than power-savvy Florida. 
“We need to focus on the lead-
off guy of every inning,” Zunino said. “Obviously, if we can get them out and they can’t get on, then they can’t do the stuff they want to do.”
The Titans’ baserunning 
masks a serious power deficiency — Zunino’s 19 home runs dur -ing his sophomore campaign were two more than the entire Cal State Fullerton team had all season. The Gators finished last season ranked No. 5 in the nation in home runs with 69, while the Titans stumbled into the picture at No. 231.
Already an aggressive pitcher 
who shoots for early contact, the lack of pop in Cal State Fuller -
ton’s lineup has Randall excited to attack.
“If there’s not a lot of power 
guys, you’re not really wor -
ried about them running into a fastball and driving it out of the park,” he said. 
“I’m going to try to knock 
them out of their element, and they’re going to try to do the same thing.”
Bad contact is what Randall 
and an infield that could likely start freshmen at second base and third base tonight is hoping for.
The Titans were able to reel 
off 24 triples in 2011 off  pitchers who approached the four-time national champions with little respect for power. Every regular starter for Fullerton had at least one triple last season, and desig-nated hitter Tyler Pill is the only one of the Titans’ five players who hit .313 or better last season not to return. 
“We just have to pitch to con-
tact and trust our defense,” Zu-nino said. 
“We’ve got to take chances 
pounding the strike zone and hopefully get some good outs, some early outs and keep our pitch count low.”

What happened to the Florida Way?
You all remember the line Will Muschamp ut-
tered when he was introduced as Florida’s coach 
on Dec. 14, 2010; the words that generated excitement among 
fans and made everyone think Muschamp was the kind of no-nonsense guy the Gators needed after players accrued more than 30 arrests during Urban Meyer’s tenure.
“There’s a certain thing that I’m going to refer to as the 
Florida Way, and that’s the way they need to act and that’s the way they need to represent our university,” Muschamp said. “I’m going to demand that, and I think that you’ll un-derstand in time that that’s something that’s very important to me.”
Fourteen months later, though, 
the Florida Way has simply fallen by the wayside.
The arrest counter crept into dou-
ble-digits Wednesday night when tight end A.C. Leonard was charged with domestic battery. The 10 arrests by nine different players in just more 
than a year signal one of two things: Either the Florida Way isn’t important to Muschamp, or he doesn’t have control of his team.Regardless of the answer, Muschamp must send a mes-
sage to his team and to the fanbase that proves he is serious about this program.
Florida released a statement from Muschamp on Thurs-
day evening saying Leonard has been suspended and that he doesn’t “condone this type of behavior.”
Muschamp took the easy way out.  The myriad arrests under Meyer were masked by the 
product on the field, because winning cures all. Muschamp doesn’t have that luxury following a 7-6 season; he needed to take action.Muschamp’s words hold little weight as arrests pile upFlorida prepared for Cal State Fullerton’s small-ball approach
“We’ve got to take chanc-
es pounding the strike zone 
and hopefully get some 
good outs, some early outs 
and keep our pitch count 
low.”

The free-throw line reared its 
ugly head again for the Gators on 
Thursday night.
Florida (16-10, 6-7 Southeastern 
Conference) made just 13 of 23 free throws in a 75-69 overtime loss to Vanderbilt (20-6, 8-5 SEC) in Nash-ville, Tenn.
Losing to the Commodores 
dropped the Gators’ record to 2-9 this season in games decided by six points or fewer.
Florida seemingly had the game 
in hand after Jaterra Bonds forced a key turnover by Vanderbilt’s Chris-tina Foggie with 15.8 seconds left in regulation.
Foggie, who entered the game as 
the SEC’s leading scorer with 18.1 points per game, drove the lane for the go-ahead score, but was called for a charge after knocking Bonds to the floor on the way to the basket.
Lanita Bartley made two free 
throws after drawing a foul on the ensuing possession, widening UF’s lead to three points at 65-62 with 11 seconds to play.
Foggie redeemed her costly of-
fensive foul just seconds early by draining a tying 3-pointer that danced around the rim and into the hoop at the final horn, sending the game into overtime knotted at 65-65.
“We didn’t talk about [Foggie’s 
buzzer-beater]; we just talked about 
getting ready 
to play,” coach Amanda Butler said. “This five minutes (in over -
time) had to be ours and we had to set the tone the way that we had for most of the 
ball game.” 
The overtime period proved 
costly for the Gators as the offense sputtered.
Florida scored just four points 
and made 1 of 9 field goal attempts in the extra period.
“We just weren’t very cohesive as a unit, offensively ,” Butler said. “Consequently , we weren’t getting good looks. We weren’t taking what was there.”
Jennifer George recorded team-
high marks with 17 points and nine rebounds, narrowly missing out on her 14th double-double of the sea-son.
The junior forward’s offensive 
output helped the UF bench out-score Vanderbilt’s reserves 37-10.
The Florida bench contributed 
11 of its first 19 points of the second half, helping build a 51-45 lead with 9:22 remaining.
However, the Gators failed to 
put the game away , never building on their six-point advantage.
“We had great momentum,” 
Butler said. “We didn’t sustain our intensity very well. We relaxed when we got up on them a few pos-sessions and you can’t do that at any point in an SEC competition.”

With the 2012 season at its midpoint, 
coach Rhonda Faehn plans on giving her  
top gymnasts some much-needed rest tonight. 
When No. 2 Florida (7-1, 3-1 South-
eastern Conference) takes on No. 17 Au-burn (3-8, 0-4 SEC) in Auburn Arena at 8 p.m., the Gators’ supporting cast will see more action with most of their all-arounders taking a break from at least one event. 
After tonight’s meet, UF will round 
out its regular-season schedule with a difficult stretch featuring three top-10 teams  — No. 4 Georgia, No. 9 Nebraska 
and No. 1 Utah. 
“What continually goes through 
my head is that everybody needs to be 
healthy and strong and fresh, mentally and physically,” Faehn said. “That’s what I’m focused on. Not the overall product, which I know will be there to-ward the end of the year.”
Faehn said junior Marissa King will likely sit out vault and floor exercise at Auburn, while junior Ashanée Dicker -
son, who has won two all-around titles in UF’s past three meets with totals of 39.60, will take a break from floor.  
Kytra Hunter, who won her third SEC 
Freshman Gymnast of the Week honor for her performance last Friday against No. 13 LSU, might also skip out on floor. 
Florida’s only all-arounder will likely 
be sophomore Alaina Johnson, who has 
taken part in all four events only twice this season.
With its most pro-
ductive gymnasts rest-ing in some events, UF 
hopes the supporting cast will carry momen-tum from last week.
Against LSU, the role players helped 
UF post a stellar 197.85, the fifth-highest team total in program history.
Last Friday, senior Nicole Ellis record-
ed a 9.875 on both vault and uneven bars, while junior Randy Stageberg scored a career-high 9.9 on floor. 
Senior Amy Ferguson also tallied a 
season-high 9.875 on floor, her specialty event, and freshman Rachel Spicer scored a 9.85 on both balance beam and floor.  
In addition, sophomore Mackenzie 
Caquatto won her third consecutive bars title with a 9.9. Even little-used se-nior Elizabeth Mahlich posted a 9.825 on bars.
“We have at least seven or eight solid 
routines on each event,” Ferguson said. “We always have people who are ready and willing to step in. We are prepared if we have four all-arounders or three or two or one.” 
Faehn said she believes her team’s 
supporting cast is the key to winning an NCAA championship this year. 
“You need the heavy hitters, those 
hitting the four events consistently, but the 1-6 (on each lineup) has to be top,” Faehn said. “[The role players] are going to do a great job once again. They’re go-ing to step up and really utilize that op-portunity to shine.”

After Janoris Jenkins racked up his 
second marijuana-related arrest in a 
matter of months, Muschamp showed the Gators’ best player the door. If Muschamp is serious, and wants the rest of us to believe he is, he should have made an example of Leonard.
The details of the Gainesville Po-
lice Department’s arrest report are re-pulsive, and if it’s true that Leonard ripped “chunks of hair” out of the vic-tim’s head, pushed her into a dog cage and even dragged her feet first out of his apartment, then Muschamp needs to do more. And more importantly, he needs to make it clear that domestic violence will not be tolerated.
I don’t care much if players smoke 
marijuana or drink underage. But violence against women or children is inexcusable and should be treated as such.
If Muschamp is willing to publicly 
take the NCAA to task for suspending Sharrif Floyd early in the season, then he should do the same when his own players act reprehensibly.
Jenkins got the boot because it was 
his second offense, and while this is Leonard’s first arrest, it is not his first incident involving violence, as he once swung on an opponent during a game his senior year of high school.
That should have made it easier 
for Muschamp to make an example of Leonard. 
Pull his scholarship. Boot him from 
the team. Do something to prove that domestic violence is a serious issue. 
But he didn’t.Muschamp needs to decide which 
way he wants this program to head, both on the field and off it, because the Florida Way clearly isn’t working out.

tor.org.� THE GATORS OPEN THEIR FIRST 
HOME SERIES TODAY AGAINST THE SPARTANS.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators’ golden opportunity in the 
Golden State will have to wait.
In less than a week, No. 1 Florida will 
face three ranked opponents in three days at 
the Cathedral City Classic in Palm Springs, Calif. However, before coach Tim Walton’s team can look ahead to its trip out west, it must focus on its home weekend series with Michigan State.
Spartans’ coach Jacquie Joseph recently 
took her squad down to Miami for the Com-bat Classic, where it dropped four games, with only one coming to a ranked oppo-nent. 
Now, Michigan State (1-4) will take 
a crack at the top team in the nation in Gainesville.
Walton will try to keep his team from 
viewing this weekend series as just an ex-hibition. But many of the young players are excited for their first cross-country series, including freshman Lauren Haeger, who is from Peoria, Ariz.
“Being from that side of the country, it’s 
going to be exciting to finally go over there,” Haeger said. “A bunch of people are going to see their families and everything, so I’m really excited.”
Because the Spartans have failed to rack 
up a quality win this season, it is easy for the Gators to overlook this weekend and eye their matchups with several Top 25 teams.
The three most prominent games Florida 
will play in California are against No. 18 Texas A&M, No. 13 Texas and No. 7 Wash-ington. However, the Gators must first go head-to-head in a three game series against the Spartans.
Possibly helping Florida not look past 
this matchup against MSU is the fact that it will be its first home weekend series of the year. 
Haeger does not want to disappoint the 
home crowd.“I hope we have a lot of fans,” Haeger 
added. “It’s going to be crazy finally getting to play here. I don’t really know to expect, but I’m just excited to go play.”
“Florida fans are awesome,” freshman 
Sami Fagan added. “I think they will just pump us up. We’re excited to play for peo-ple. We want to show them what we have.”
What the Gators have is an overpower -
ing offense that scored nearly as many runs in their first two games (16) as the Spartans have accumulated in five (17).
Walton said he knows his team has a 
target on its back and must stay vigilant throughout the season.
“Everybody is going to come out to get 
the Gators,” Walton said. “And I think our players understand that. They really don’t get too high or too low. The demeanor is the same and the intensity is the same.”
Florida’s intensity will certainly be tested 
this weekend. But when asked if the Gators will be ready for their relatively short home-stand before heading off to California, Hae-ger answered with complete assuredness. 
“Definitely we rested up and got our 
bodies right and our minds rights,” Haeger said. “So we’re ready.”20, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 2012
