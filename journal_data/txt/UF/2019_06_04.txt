Caillin Heron, a second army lieutenant and 22-year-old UF criminol-
ogy graduate, was diagnosed with the mumps in her ﬁ  rst week of active 
duty at Fort Knox. Her symptoms started with a discomfort in her jaw 
and quickly escalated to a high fever and swollen jaw.
SO FAR 18 UF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN 
DIAGNOSED WITH MUMPS 
By T ori Whidden
Staff Writer
On May 19, her ﬁ  rst day of active duty at Fort 
Knox, second army lieutenant and recent UF crimi-
nology graduate, Caillin Heron, was eating with 
her friends when she noticed it was hard to chew. 
The 22-year-old’s jaw discomfort worsened 
after swelling progressed. She woke up the next 
day with a 102-degree fever which sent her to the 
hospital, she said. Five days later, Heron was diag-
nosed with the mumps.
“I’m pretty pissed at UF because I don’t feel 
that they were very proactive when I told them I 
had the mumps,” Heron said. “We get alerts all the 
time about suspects robbing Bojangles’, but this is 
actually pertinent.”
Heron’s doctor told her that most people re-
ceive the vaccine as a toddler, but after 20 years, 
the vaccine reduces to 88 percent effective. 
Now, Heron encourages her friends, family and 
strangers to receive a third MMR vaccine to almost 
guarantee immunity against measles, mumps and rubella.
Heron is one of the 18 vaccinated UF students 
conﬁ  rmed with having mumps, said UF spokesper-
son Steve Orlando. The university diagnosed and 
recorded the ﬁ  rst mumps case of this outbreak on 
May 3.  
Mumps is a viral illness contracted by oral 
transmission. The illness is characterized by swol-
len glands, particularly around the jawline and 
neck, a fever and fatigue, Orlando said. 
“Saliva is the easiest way to spread it,” Orlando 
said. “That’s why they say don’t share. No sharing 
drinks or eating utensils and kissing, another thing 
that is popular among college students.”
Mumps cases and outbreaks have increased ev-
ery ﬁ  ve years since 2006, according to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Out-
breaks can occur in communities of people who 
have received the standard recommended two 
doses or fewer of the MMR vaccine and are par-
ticularly common in close-contact settings.
High vaccination coverage helps limit the size, 
duration and spread of mumps outbreaks. Since 
the two-MMR dose vaccination program was in-
troduced in 1989, U.S. mumps cases decreased by 
more than 99 percent, according to the CDC. UF suﬀ  ers May mumps outbreak

A LACK OF RAINFALL 
ACTS AS A MAJOR 
CULPRIT IN THE FIGHT 
AGAINST FIRES
By Ashley Lazarski
Staff Writer
Ninety-one active ﬁ  res 
across the state have been re-
ported as of Monday, but this 
number can change several 
times a day, according to Ludie 
Bond, the wildﬁ  re mitigation 
specialist at the Waccasassa 
Forestry Center. An active ﬁ  re is uncontained, 
no matter how long it has been 
burning. A ﬁ  re can only be con-
sidered inactive once there is 
no longer any visible smoke or 
ﬂ  ame.
To contain these ﬁ  res, ﬁ  re-
ﬁ  ghters use bulldozers to plow 
ditches around them. When 
the ﬁ  re reaches the edge of the 
ditch, it cannot continue further 
because the dirt will not burn, 
so it is considered contained, 
Bond said. 
Most of these ﬁ  res are 
caused by lightning, but some are “incendiary” ﬁ  res, which 
means that they are caused by 
humans. Sometimes, these ﬁ  res 
are caused by burning debris, 
Bond said. 
To combat incendiary ﬁ  res, 
some counties enact burn bans, 
which prevent citizens from 
starting ﬁ  res, especially when 
they are too close to homes and 
other ﬂ  ammable structures. 
This allows ﬁ  re departments to 
focus on lightning-caused ﬁ  res 
and other unpreventable situa-
tions, Bond said. 
“Right now, of course, we’re encouraging people not to burn 
anything until we get signiﬁ  -
cant rainfall, but we also have 
a sheet of tips such as not burn-
ing on windy days or leaving 
your ﬁ  re unattended,” Bond 
said.  
Bond also recommends fol-
lowing a three-step plan called 
“ready, set, go.” 
“Ready” asks homeowners 
to make a ﬁ  re-defendable space 
around their homes by clear-
ing away dry leaf litter that can Florida brush ﬁ  re tally at 91 and counting

As stated on pg. 1, there have been 18 cases of the mumps at UF since May 
3. The UF Student Health Care Center made this graphic to inform all how 
to protect oneself from the orally transmitted disease.

THE 31-PAGE REPORT 
DETAILS WAYS UF CAN 
IMPROVE THE CEREMO -
NY FOR PARTICIPANTS
By Charlie Daffron
Staff Writer
From administrators pushing 
graduates offstage to outdoor cer-
emonies being canceled for bad 
weather, many graduates have left 
their commencement feeling un-
satisfied.
In response, UF’s  President’s 
Commencement Task Force rec-
ommended changes to graduation 
in a 31-page report.
The task force has just pub-
lished its report after a six-month-
long investigation from August 
2018 to January 2019, said UF 
spokesperson Steve Orlando.
The report recommended pro-
viding options for low-income 
families to help minimize the cost of staying in Gainesville as well 
as standardizing the selection and 
training of graduation marshals. 
It also suggested making 
more effort to recognize the com-
mencements of certain groups on 
campus, including Hispanic and 
Latinx graduation, the Disability 
Resource Center’s Pioneering Ac-
cess Ceremony and Honors Gradu-
ation by adding them to the com-
mencement website.
Orlando said some of the task 
force’s other recommendations 
are still under consideration, in-
cluding the adoption of a purpose 
statement for graduation planning 
committees, hiring an artistic di-
rector for future ceremonies and 
creating more recognition ceremo-
nies for students who have won 
awards.
The task force gathered data 
from UF staff, students and fami-
lies to produce the report, Orlando 
said.  
The task force was created after the Spring 2018 College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences commencement, 
where graduates were forcefully 
removed from stage for trying to 
do a celebratory dance. 
According to the report, the task 
force’s findings were published 
after the Spring 2019 commence-
ment, so changes planned prior to 
the group’s formation could also 
be evaluated.   The team was co-
led by former Student Body Presi-
dent Ian Green and former UF Vice 
President of Student Affairs Dave 
Parrott. It was comprised of 25 
people, made up of volunteers and 
members selected by UF President 
Kent Fuchs, Green and Parrott. 
Made up of equal parts stu-
dents, faculty and staff, the task 
force met every two weeks and 
subcommittees met during off 
weeks. 
The job of the task force was 
to identify commencement prob-
lems and find ways to improve it 
for students, their families and the 
staff working during the events.The task force has no plans to 
reconvene now that its final report 
has been published, Orlando said. 
Anthony Rojas, a 23-year-old 
political science master’s student, 
doesn’t think the university han-
dled the task force properly.
Rojas said President Fuchs and 
the administration should have 
acted with more transparency dur-
ing the process instead of conduct-
ing meetings behind closed doors 
and not letting students voice their 
concerns.
“If they really wanted to involve 
the students, they should have 
hosted a town hall-style meeting 
where students could come talk to 
Fuchs and the rest of the task force 
in person,” Rojas said. 
Rojas hopes that the university 
will finally take the steps possible 
to give graduates the ceremonies 
they deserve.
@charlie_daffron
cdaffron@alligator.orgGraduation task force recommends changes
catch fire.
“Set” means to have an 
evacuation plan, similar to any 
other natural disaster.
“Go” means to pay attention 
to local media outlets, social me -
dia and emergency management 
teams such as local fire rescue 
services to stay aware of any 
fires in the area, Bond said. 
“Don’t wait until a fire is com -
ing your way to prepare,” Bond 
said. 
Although changes in weather 
patterns may bring the rain need -
ed to lower the drought index, 
Bond also warns lightning fires 
may continue. 
Jamie Clifford, the district 
chief of the Alachua County Fire Rescue, notes that although 
burning is not allowed within 
Gainesville city limits, it is in -
credibly important to follow the 
rules for burning yard waste for 
Alachua County citizens outside 
of Gainesville.
Two important tips are to al -
ways clear the area to bare soil 
and to cover any barrels with 
wire mesh to prevent sparks 
from spreading, Clifford said. 
“We are coming into brush 
fire season now, and they have 
been increasing in the last week 
or so. It is important for people 
to stay safe and know these 
regulations,” Clifford said.

HE WAS REMOVED AND 
CHARGED WITH TRESPASSING IN 
MARCH
By Rachael Schirmer
Staff Writer
Jeffrey Russell Barnes, 66, was arrested by 
Gainesville Police Thursday afternoon after he 
violated a protection against stalking order for 
an employee of West 20, according to a police 
report.
In March, Barnes was removed from the 
apartment complex after he was seen mastur-
bating in his car while parked in the front lot, 
according to an arrest report. After this, Barnes 
returned to the complex at least three times. 
The protection against stalking order was per-
manently put in place on May 13. 
Barnes parked his vehicle outside of the 
leasing ofﬁ  ce, located at 3527 SW 20th Ave. on 
Wednesday, according to the report. A witness said she noticed Barnes 
immediately when she 
arrived to work at 10 
a.m., prompting Barnes 
to drive away, according 
to the report.
Barnes was found at 
his apartment, which is 
across the street from the 
complex. He initially de-
nied going to the wom-
an’s workplace but later admitted to ofﬁ  cers 
he was parked in front of the leasing ofﬁ  ce.
The witness identiﬁ  ed Barnes out of a line-
up before he was arrested, according to the 
report. 
Barnes, a retired UF janitor, was charged 
with aggravated stalking and violation of an 
injunction for protection against stalking.
He remains in jail in lieu of a $10,000 bond.

A Waldo man was arrested Monday 
in connection to an incident that took 
place the evening of May 23.
Brian Thomas Bay, 51, drove by an 
acquaintance’s home while she was 
talking with a witness on the front 
porch. Bay approached the porch and 
began arguing with the woman, who 
was at least three months pregnant at 
the time, according to a police report. 
The nature of the argument is not listed 
in the report.
When the woman opened the screen 
door to the porch, Bay picked up a 
4-foot metal beam from the yard and 
approached her. Bay swung the beam 
at her while calling her explicatives, according to the re-
port. The woman 
blocked the beam 
with her hand and 
was left with small 
cuts.
The woman fol-
lowed Bay out in 
the yard, reminding 
him she was preg-
nant. Bay respond-
ed, “Not for long,” and continued to 
swing the beam at her abdomen It was 
reported that it didn’t hit her. 
Bay left after law enforcement was 
called. He was charged with aggravated 
battery. 
He remains in jail in lieu of $50,000 
bond.

THE 2019 HURRICANE 
SEASON BEGINS IN JUNE 
AND ENDS IN NOVEMBER
By Meleah Lyden 
Staff Writer
In recent years, UF students 
felt the danger of hurricane sea-
son ﬁ  rsthand from the devastating 
storms of Hurricane Irma and Hur-
ricane Maria.    
This year’s hurricane season, 
which starts in June and ends in 
November, is still ﬁ  lled with un-
certainty, said Corene Matyas, UF 
associate professor in the geology 
department. 
Predictions are made by exam-
ining general levels of activity, like 
whether the number of storms that 
form might be average, below av-
erage or above average, she said. 
These predictions are based on re-
gional scale characteristics like the 
ocean temperature and potential 
winds. The past few hurricane seasons 
were memorable because they 
went over land and impacted a lot 
of people. 
To ensure UF is ready this sea-
son, UF’s Department of Emergen-
cy Management has been prepar-
ing by offering shelter managers 
training courses for UF employees 
interested in serving if a disaster 
arises, said Kenneth Allen, director 
of the department.
“As we ramp up the hurricane 
season, the hurricane shelters 
on campus have all completed a 
walk-through, making sure they 
are ready to serve as shelters this 
year,” he said. 
The university opens shelters 
based on situations and demand. 
The available shelters include 
Southwest Recreation Center, 
the Reitz Union’s grand ballroom 
and basement, IFAS Extension 
Straughn Professional Develop-
ment Center and the Steinbrenner 
Band Hall. 
Buildings qualify as shelters under a speciﬁ  c Florida building 
code known as Enhanced Hurri-
cane Protection Area (EHPA), he 
said. Shelter buildings have higher 
windborne protection and are also 
examined for the number of bath-
rooms, air circulation and amount 
of open space.
“All of us, as a part of living in 
Florida and being a member of the 
university community, should be 
thinking about hurricanes and be 
prepared for them,” he said. 
The department stresses stu-
dents to get a plan, get a kit and be 
informed, he said. “Getting a kit” 
means having at least three days 
worth of food, water and basic 
supplies, like a ﬁ  rst aid kit, bat-
tery-powered radio and ﬂ  ashlight. 
Florida is holding a sales tax 
holiday on emergency items this 
week until Thursday, he said.
Even though the department 
stresses personal preparedness, 
the university works to monitor 
potential tropical weather through-
out hurricane season, he said. Allen suggests staying informed 
by not only following ofﬁ  cial uni-
versity accounts, like UF Public 
Safety, but also paying attention 
to local media to gauge potential 
impact in the area. 
If the threat increases locally, 
the university responds in a man-
ner it deems appropriate, Allen 
said. This could include canceling 
classes or closing university of-
ﬁ  ces. 
The university isn’t just pre-
paring for student safety, but ani-
mal safety as well. The Veterinary 
Emergency Treatment Services at 
UF’s College of Veterinary Medi-
cine is preparing for potential 
emergency relief operations as 
hurricane season begins, said Dr. 
Lawrence Garcia, medical direc-
tor for veterinary emergency treat-
ment services. 
The department, made up of 
ﬁ  rst responders who help in ani-
mal-related concerns post-disaster, 
makes its services available to 
the state’s Agricultural Response Team, Garcia said. 
The team prepares by hold-
ing brieﬁ  ngs, getting equipment 
serviced and up to date, keep-
ing generators running and more. 
Petsmart charities and Banﬁ  eld 
also donated a truck and trailer 
to the department, worth about 
$150,000.
However, since the necessary 
response is dependent on the situ-
ation at hand, only so much can be 
prepared now. 
In emergencies, like Hurricane 
Irma, the department can set up 
a ﬁ  eld hospital, which is helpful 
with the new trailer and truck.
They also have a surgical unit 
trailer, used for minor surgical pro-
cedures such as laceration repairs 
on cats and dogs.
“To be able to be that resource 
for someone who has just experi-
enced unbelievable devastation is 
life changing,” Garcia said.

THERE WILL BE FOUR 
COMMUNITY MEETINGS 
TOTAL
By Tien Le
Staff Writer
The Gainesville Housing & 
Community Development Divi-
sion (HCD) held a community 
meeting on Monday evening at 
the Thelma Boltin Center, 516 NE 
2nd Ave., to review the Proposed 
Annual Action Plan. 
This was one of four meetings 
that will be held to encourage citizen feedback in review of the 
plan. 
The plan included details 
about how the city will use fed-
eral funding from the Commu-
nity Development Block Grant 
Program (CDBG) and the HOME 
Investment Partnerships Program 
for the 2019-20 year beginning on 
Oct. 1, and ending on Sept. 30, 
2020. 
The money from the U.S. De-
partment of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD) is used for 
efforts towards housing and com-
munity development. The HUD 
requires recipients to submit an Annual Action Plan.
The Gainesville City Commis-
sion adopted the Five-Year Con-
solidated Plan on Aug. 2, 2018. 
The plan includes the city’s 
community development needs, 
strategies and activities to address 
using federal money. 
The City anticipates $1,319,592 
in CDBG funding for the 2019-20 
year. The money will be used for 
the provision of decent housing, a 
suitable living environment and 
expanded economic activity, ac-
cording to the presentation. 
The City anticipates $530,141 
in HOME funding. Eligible ac-tivities for the program include 
homeownership assistance, hous-
ing rehabilitation and new con-
struction of affordable housing. 
Gainesville resident and com-
munity activist Kali Blount, 62, 
gave feedback at the meeting. 
“The housing pattern we have 
is totally about racism and today, 
economic segregation has re-
placed racial segregation, but it’s 
80 percent approximate,” he said. 
“We have to face up to it and say 
we’re not going to be this any-
more.”

ColumnAliens need more attention
Aliens have fascinated humans since the discovery 
of space. E.T., ALF, Spock and Marvin the Martian 
are just a few of the extraterrestrial characters from 
humanity’s imagination. The human perception of 
aliens goes to show how dedicated we are to the un-
known little (or very big) guys way out in space. At least this 
seemed to be the case until recently. 
On May 26, The New York Times published an article report-
ing Navy pilots witnessed objects with “no visible engine or in-
frared exhaust plumes but could reach 30,000 feet and hypersonic 
speeds.” 
Almost every day from the summer of 2014 to March 2015, 
these bizarre objects ﬂ  ew over the East Coast. Although the U.S. 
Department of Defense did not call this extraterrestrial activity, 
the lack of public interest from this report was surprising.
What happened to people’s fascination with the unknown? 
Not even a meme or blurb on aliens came about in the Twit-
ter-sphere. At least a bit on aliens getting “slept on” would have 
sufﬁ  ced. Seriously? Not a single meme from this article? Shame 
on you Internet. What a wasted opportunity. 
Having that the NYT article came out over the Memorial Day 
weekend, people could have been too busy drinking and boating 
to care about the possibility of unidentiﬁ  ed ﬂ  ying objects. We 
didn’t expect much outspoken response from the normal person 
who pays an average amount of attention to the news. But we ex-
pected more from the people that are so quick to judge journalism 
and share news articles with the caption “fake news!!!” Isn’t this 
the kind of thing people love to make conspiracy theories about? 
The size of the universe is hard to wrap our brains around. 
We can’t be the only ones. If we aren’t alone, how has nobody 
mustered up the courage to send an intergalactic “you up?” text? 
This is what scientiﬁ  c folk refer to as the Fermi Paradox, the 
phenomena that despite there being billions of stars in our galaxy, 
there has never been an indication of alien civilization. Even if we 
narrow our universal search just to the Milky Way, there would 
be around 1 million planets with potential life. 
But there are a few ideas as to why aliens haven’t “hit us up.” 
The “zoo hypothesis” claims aliens don’t talk to us because they 
have set us aside in a sort of wilderness area like a captive zoo 
animal. Another explanation is advanced alien civilizations have 
been in hibernation waiting for a future universe cold enough to 
cool their supercomputers. 
If this Navy pilot encounter with unidentiﬁ  ed objects was 
aliens, how rude of us not to make a bigger ordeal over their 
visit. Maybe the Fermi Paradox has nothing to do with aliens 
not coming to visit us. Maybe we humans just refuse to give the 
extraterrestrials the attention they deserve. Come on, they ﬂ  ew all 
the way here, probably scared the crap out of some Navy pilot, 
got the New York Times to write about said surprising visit, and 
we still didn’t care. 
Why visit a planet whose inhabitants don’t even bat an eye 
when you visit? Earth’s hospitality rating could be cosmically low 
and aliens have better vacation destinations to spend their fuel 
traveling to. Compared to alien standards, Earth may not even 
be considered beautiful or exotic (of course, most humans would 
disagree with this but mostly because they’ve never seen another 
planet). Earth could be the Mount Trash-more of the universe 
with only crazies wanting to visit this dump. 
Next time there’s a whiff of aliens in the air, let’s use it as a 
practice drill for if the real deal happens. Bring out all the stops or 
at least get them trending on Twitter.

EDITORArt takes multiple forms. While paint-
ings and sculptures are the ﬁ  rst me-
diums to come to mind, ﬁ  lms, televi-
sion shows, stand-up comedy and 
music are also prominent forms of art. 
Whether you’re listening to Miley Cyrus’s new 
album “SHE IS COMING,” laughing at the latest 
comedy special released on Netﬂ  ix or watching 
Pokémon Detective Pikachu in theaters while 
having no prior knowledge of Pokémon, you 
interact with artists and their artwork.
When we think of a certain song, ﬁ  lm or tv show, we tend 
to also think about the person connected to the art piece. 
When we can’t remember the name of  a movie, the ﬁ  rst 
thing we ask usually goes something like this: “What’s that 
movie called, the one where Amanda Bynes sticks a tampon 
up her nose?” The answer is easier to remember when you 
think about the artists behind the work. 
Artists, while recognized for their artwork, are also at-
tached to what they say and the actions they take, but some 
actions are more memorable than others. 
Kanye West’s infamous “slavery is a choice” line dur-
ing his appearance on TMZ Live last year is an example of 
this.  And you might not recall Chris Brown being the face of 
Wrigley’s Doublemint gum back in their 2008 commercial, 
but you’ll never forget seeing Rihanna’s two black eyes all 
over the internet after being assaulted by him. Some time has 
passed since both of these controversial events, but does that 
mean it’s time to forgive and forget?
Everyone has opinions, and everyone is entitled to them. 
You might not agree with all of Kanye West’s views, but did 
you ever really think you would? Different people are bound 
to have different points of views on certain topics. That’s the 
beauty of diversity. 
Being a fan of someone’s music/movie/comedy act 
doesn’t mean you have to be a fan of the artist themselves. 
Even if your favorite actor believes in something you’re to-tally against, you shouldn’t hold back from en-
joying the ﬁ  lms they star in. To say only a good 
person can produce good art is just untrue. 
Plenty of terrible people have created beautiful 
art. Why deprive yourself of something you en-
joy based on the words of someone else? Enjoy-
ing someone’s art says you enjoy his or her art, 
period.
Words may go quiet over time, but ac-
tions speak louder. If an artist is found guilty 
of assault, molestation and rape, that changes 
things. Once the news broke that Louis C.K. admitted to sex-
ual misconduct with ﬁ  ve different women, he was no longer 
seen as a funny guy but more so as a sexual predator. In Har-
vey Weinstein’s case, he sexually abused over 100 women 
throughout his career in the ﬁ  lm industry, making viewers 
see actresses in his ﬁ  lms as victims rather than stars. When 
past actions overshadow the way we view artists’ work, then 
we can no longer enjoy it, even if we wanted. These types of 
people are not artists, they’re just evil people with creative 
minds. 
While it’s easier to think an artist and their art should be 
separated, it’s not so easily practiced. With great social plat-
form comes great responsibility. We will always associate art 
with its creator, but whether we chose to care for the artist 
is upon ourselves. 
If the worst part about an artist is their opinion, then our 
judgement of their music doesn’t have to change. If a song 
sounds good, it sounds good. If a joke is funny, it’s funny. 
But when the person behind the microphone is a complete 
monster, the good thoughts you once had surrounding the 
words they said tend to disappear.
Earth without art may be bland, but the world will be just 
ﬁ  ne without R. Kelly’s “Ignition (Remix).”

opinions@alligator.orgThought vaccines had wiped out disease 
and cleared the way for a sickness-free fu-
ture? Well, mumps came to UF to prove 
you wrong.
The Alligator reported 18 UF students 
had contracted mumps as of Monday, a disease 
characterized by “swollen glands, particularly 
around the jawline and neck, a fever and fatigue.” 
All the students had been vaccinated against 
mumps. 
So how is this possible? 
Well, as PBS explained, the MMR vaccines, 
which protect against mumps, measles and rubella, are not 
100 percent effective. The vaccine provides a 99 percent 
protection rate after two doses. The unprotected 1 percent 
doesn’t mean vaccines are worthless. The 1 percent is still 
a concern, and for that, another key concept should kick in: 
herd immunity.
Herd immunity is the idea that if the vast majority of the 
population is vaccinated against a particular disease, that 
disease will not gain a foothold in the population and few 
people will come into contact with it. This not only provides 
additional protection to vaccinated people, but it also pro-
tects unvaccinated people as there will always be a segment 
of the population who cannot receive vaccines due to health 
reasons. Unfortunately, not all people who do not take vac-
cines are doing it for health reasons. That’s where we run 
into problems.
In recent years, growing skepticism over vaccines and 
concerns of harmful effects have led to more people opting 
not to vaccinate their children. According to the Center for Disease Control, the percentage of unvaccinated 
children rose from 0.3 percent among children 
born in 2001 to 1.3 percent among children born 
in 2015. This may not sound like much, but herd 
immunity requires just about everyone who is 
healthy enough for vaccines to get one. Even a 
small decrease can make a big difference. And 
with other outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in 
Disneyland in 2014, we can see the weakening of 
herd immunity in action.
So what do we do now? The obvious answer: 
get vaccinated if you haven’t already. Contrary to 
the fearmongering, vaccines are safe and usually only have 
minimal and temporary side effects. 
I’ll refer to numbers given by LiveScience, which show 
vaccines have saved the lives of 732,000 U.S. children, saved 
another 300 million from getting sick and (contrary to the 
claims of a decades-old discredited paper) no vaccines have 
been shown to cause autism. 
In addition, not getting the vaccine and catching one of 
the diseases you’re supposed to be vaccinated against can 
have even more serious consequences. One in 10 children 
who contract measles develop an ear infection that could 
lead to permanent hearing loss. One in 1,000 children who 
contract measles dies. Before the chickenpox vaccine was 
introduced, 100 people out of the 4 million who contracted 
the disease died each year.
The beneﬁ  ts clearly outweigh any risks.

Will Flaniken, 2, points at a painting while his father, Chipper Flaniken, 32, holds him 
at the exhibition opening. Chipper Flaniken, a pastor at City Church of Gainesville, 
said he and his son love Artwalk in general, but they came to “A Walk in the Park” 
to support their friend Logan Marconi, one of the featured artists. Flaniken said his 
son was fascinated with the painting because he loves water.
Dwight Jenkins, 59, and Cayley Buckner, 21-year-old UF English and natural 
resource conservation senior, dance Friday night during the opening of the “A Walk 
in the Park” exhibition. Jenkins and Buckner are both members of the Gainesville 
Old-Time Dance Society, a local community for contra dancing. Contra dancing is a 
type of social dance where people can attend alone and find a partner at the event. 
“I hated dancing before I found contra, ” said Buckner, who has been dancing for 
about four years. “I was the kid who would sneak off to the library and read during 
school dances. ”
The Galleries at the Historic Thomas 
Center celebrated the opening of a 
new art exhibition entitled “ A Walk in 
the Park” on Friday night. The show 
features local artists whose work aims to 
encourage the appreciation of local parks 
in the community. The gallery’s opening 
reception was part of May’s Artwalk 
Gainesville event. “ A Walk in the Park” 
will be on display until Jan. 4, 2020. The 
exhibition was organized in collaboration 
with the citizens and city employees 
behind the yearlong “Gainesville 150!” 
celebration, which commemorates 
the 150th anniversary of the City of 
Gainesville’s incorporation.

Stellar pitching from Kelly Barnhill and consistent hitting from Amanda Lorenz led UF to a WCWS berth.
I generally consider 
myself a baseball pur-
ist.
I’m not a big fan of 
interleague play. I hate 
those garish “Players 
Weekend” uniforms. 
I usually despise all of 
Rob Manfred’s ideas 
on how to improve the 
game (hello, juiced balls).
There is one thing, however, 
that Major League Baseball needs to 
change.
Last week in Houston, a young 
girl in the stands was struck by a line 
drive off the bat of the Cubs’ Albert 
Almora Jr. It was hard to watch. The 
girl was rushed out of the stadium 
as stunned fans looked on. Almora 
was shown praying, and many play-
ers were visibly shaken on the ﬁ  eld.
It was a scene that should never 
happen at a baseball stadium.
The girl who was hit in Houston 
is expected to recover, but there are 
examples of people who weren’t 
so lucky. Last year, a woman died 
because of acute intracranial hem-
orrhage after being struck by a foul 
ball at Dodger Stadium. In 2011, a 
fan at Yankee Stadium suffered a 
damaged left eye socket and frac-
tured cheekbone after being hit by a 
baseball.
Fans have been at risk attending 
baseball games from the beginning. 
The courts say that a fan accepts 
that danger by purchasing a ticket, 
and Major League Baseball has been protected legally.
Just because the 
league can’t be sued 
for it doesn’t mean it 
shouldn’t protect its 
customers.
In 2018, MLB man-
dated that netting 
should be extended to 
the end of each dugout. 
That was a good ﬁ  rst step, but the 
incident in Houston shows it’s not 
enough. Nets in every ballpark need 
to be extended to the foul pole.
I’ve sat behind these nets before. 
They're barely noticeable.
Enough of the “pay attention to 
the game” excuse. Even if she had 
her eyes glued to the game, how 
is a little girl supposed to dodge a 
screaming liner? How many pitchers 
– professionals – have we seen hit 
by line drives? Sometimes it’s impos-
sible to react.
Also – and again, I say this 
as a purist – fans shouldn’t have 
to have their eyes glued to every 
pitch. Baseball has a problem at-
tracting younger fans – the type 
of people who might, say, look at 
their phone during an inning. It’s 
2019. They should be able to do 
it safely.
Fans shouldn’t have to worry 
about ending a day at the ballpark 
in the hospital. Parents shouldn’t 
have to worry the safety of their 
children. What happened the oth-
er day in Houston should never 
happen again.It’s time to extend the 
netting in MLB stadiumsSam's Strike ZoneSOFTBALL

There are many positives to take away from this 
year’s Florida softball team despite Saturday’s season-
ending loss to Alabama.
The team won a second-consecutive SEC Tourna-
ment Championship, cruised through NCAA Regional 
play and arrived at the Women’s College World Series 
as an elite threat.
The way the season ended on a national stage will 
sting for quite some time, and deservedly so. But the 
Gators must now shift their focus toward the future.
Next year’s Florida team will look signiﬁ  cantly dif-
ferent. Two of the most decorated players to ever wear 
orange and blue, Kelly Barnhill and Amanda Lorenz, 
both played their last collegiate games at USA Softball 
Hall of Fame Stadium on Saturday. It was an emotional 
send-off.“Being a Florida Gator has meant the absolute world 
to me,” Barnhill said in a post-game press conference 
amidst a ﬂ  ood of tears. “The culture that (coach Tim 
Walton) created here, I’ve grown so much in the last 
four years.”
Barnhill, a two-time SEC Pitcher of the Year, brought 
an SEC-worst offense (by batting average) to college 
softball’s biggest stage this year. The senior performed 
admirably, recording 202 of the previous 211 outs in 
the postseason prior to her early departure in Satur-
day’s ﬁ  nal game against the Crimson Tide.
For Lorenz, last year’s SEC Player of the Year, it 
was a similarly emotional departure. The most proliﬁ  c 
slugger in program history leaves UF with a .406 ca-
reer batting average. At times when the Gators’ lineup 
struggled, Lorenz could provide the necessary spark to 
salvage a victory.
The impact that these two had on this year’s team

Florida’s season didn’t end at the 
College World Series.
This year, the Gators baseball 
team lost 9-8 in an elimination game 
against Dallas Baptist in Lubbock, 
Texas, getting bounced from the 
NCAA Tournament in regional play 
for the ﬁ  rst time since 2013.
The Gators’ CWS streak ended at 
four with this season’s regional exit, 
leaving the team short of its goal to 
make it to Omaha, which has be-
come an expectation for this base-
ball program.This season’s squad was ﬁ  lled 
with a mixture of youth and inex-
perience after key departures by 
starting pitchers Brady Singer and 
Jackson Kowar, along with third 
baseman Jonathan India, among 
others.
UF performed up to expectations 
during the non-conference slate, en-
tering its ﬁ  rst SEC series with Missis-
sippi State at 14-5.
That’s when the team’s youth 
and the competition of the SEC be-
gan to clash.
The Gators dropped ﬁ  ve of 
their ﬁ  rst six SEC games, including Youth and the loss of key pieces caused Florida to fall short of Omaha

GATORS IN MLB
By Dylan O’Shea
Sports Writer
The odds of making a Major 
League Baseball roster coming out 
of college are miniscule. 
About 1,200 players are drafted 
in the 40 rounds of the MLB Draft. 
To put that into perspective, each 
major league team holds an active 
roster of just 25 players at one time. 
The amount of players in MLB on 
any given day, regardless of roster 
changes, is 750.
Of all the UF players who have 
touched the diamond in orange and 
blue, only 70 have gone on to ful-
ﬁ  ll their dreams of making it to the 
bigs. 
Despite the long odds, there is 
still a strong Florida presence in the 
majors.
On Opening Day of 2019, seven 
former Gators suited up for a Ma-
jor League Baseball team. Those 
players were rookies Pete Alonso 
(Mets) and Richie Martin (Ori-
oles), along with veterans Har-
rison Bader (Cardinals), Mike 
Zunino (Rays), Anthony DeScla-
fani (Reds), Brian Johnson (Red 
Sox) and Darren O’Day (Braves). 
Some players have been sent up 
and down during that time, while others have stuck around.
Alonso, a ﬁ  rst baseman, has 
gotten off to a hot start in his ﬁ  rst 
year in the majors. After playing 
for Florida from 2014-2016, Alonso 
was drafted by the New York Mets 
in the second round with the 64th 
pick. Alonso quickly developed 
into a feared power hitter in the 
Mets system, smashing 36 minor 
league home runs in 2018. Since 
opening day, Alonso leads all rook-
ies in home runs (19), RBIs (44), 
hits (56) and games played (58). 
He won April Rookie of the Month, 
and is currently third in the majors 
in home runs and ninth in RBIs.
As for the veteran players, Har-
rison Bader is starting to come into 
his own. Bader, who played at UF 
from 2013-2015, is now in his third 
year with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
He has ﬁ  ve home runs, a .343 OBP 
and 14 RBIs as a center ﬁ  elder.
Long-time MLB catcher Mike 
Zunino is now in his seventh year 
in the bigs and is currently with 
the Tampa Bay Rays. He played 
for the Gators from 2010-2012 and 
was drafted 3rd overall by Seattle 
in the 2012 draft. Zunino has never 
hit for average, but he has always 
provided a solid backstop for pitch-
ers and power at the plate. He has three home runs this year and 98 in 
his career.
Pitcher Anthony DeSclafani 
played for Florida from 2009-2011 
before being drafted by the Toronto 
Blue Jays. He made his debut for 
Miami in 2014 and has been with 
the Reds since 2015. He has a 2-3 
record with a 4.97 ERA in 11 starts 
this year.
Richie Martin, the second Flori-
da rookie, was drafted by the Oak-
land Athletics in 2015. The inﬁ  elder 
played for Florida from 2013-2015. 
Now with the Orioles, Martin is pri-
marily a bench player. This season, 
he has a .161 batting average and 
four RBIs.
Brian Johnson (2010-2012) has 
since been sent down by the Red 
Sox after Opening Day, and Darren 
O’Day (2003-2006) has been on the 
Injured List all season. 
The only Gator to receive a call-
up mid-season is Giants rookie 
Shaun Anderson, the 70th Gator 
to make it to MLB. He earned his 
ﬁ  rst career win on Saturday in an 
8-2 win against the Baltimore Ori-
oles. He has a 1-1 record with a 
4.09 ERA in four appearances.

doshea@alligator.org Gators in MLB: June update
The Associated Press
Former Florida and current New York Mets first baseman Pete 
Alonso leads all rookies with 19 home runs, 44 RBIs and 56 hits. 
The Pro Football Hall of 
Fame is always sure to bring 
controversy.
In a digital world where 
opinions are ripe, who should 
and shouldn’t be a Hall of 
Famer is often a back-and-
forth debate. Whether certain 
players deserve it (Steve At-
water, Tony Boselli, Jim Mar-
shall) or don’t (Lynn Swann, 
Troy Aikman, Terrell Davis) 
has been a very common point of discus-
sion among NFL fans, but there’s one 
player in particular I’d like to examine.
Frank Gore was drafted by the San 
Francisco 49ers in 2005, and since then, 
he’s accumulated 77 rushing touchdowns, 
4.4 yards per carry and 14,478 rushing 
yards — the fourth most yards of all time.
That’s very impressive. So why is his 
Hall of Fame status even in question?
There’s no arguing that Gore isn’t con-
sistent: He has only rushed below 1,000 
yards ﬁ  ve times in his 14-year career and 
is still producing in the NFL at 36 years 
old. The main argument against Gore’s 
entry into Canton is just how good he was 
at the height of his power.
He’s only been recognized once as an 
All-Pro, and it was a second-team nod in 
2006. Since Pro Bowls include fan vot-
ing and are thus not nearly as acclaimed, 
many argue that Gore, despite his consis-
tency, was never really the best running 
back in NFL at any point during his ca-
reer. He existed with talents like Tomlin-
son, Adrian Peterson and Steven Jackson, 
and there is an argument that you could tell the story of the NFL with-
out Gore in it.
So what makes a Hall of 
Famer? Is it consistency above 
all else, found in players like 
Gore? Is it strong peaks like  
Davis? What about the play-
ers who have no All-Pros 
but are decorated with Super 
Bowl trophies, like Aikman?
The truth is, all of those 
things do. But in my eyes, 
Gore’s consistency and volume of work 
should easily put him in. Seven of the 
next eight rushers below him on the all-
time rushing yards list are Hall of Famers 
(and Peterson, at No. 8, likely will be). 
Perhaps he was never the most dominant 
running back in the NFL at any time, but 
he has clearly made his mark on NFL his-
tory and deserves to be recognized for it.
On the ﬂ  ip side, I don’t think a short 
peak with no consistency is deserving of 
Canton. Davis is a great example — three 
First-Team All-Pros, 60 rushing touch-
downs and a 2,000 yard season but only 
seven years in the league. I feel consis-
tency should have been more heavily 
weighed among the voters in his case, but 
his two Super Bowl rings likely helped 
sway them.
All in all, what makes a Hall of Fame 
football player is subjective, and there 
will never be a true agreement as to what 
really makes one. In my eyes, however, 
players like Gore who shine through with 
their consistency and land their stats 
among the greats deserve to be among 
them.Is Frank Gore a Hall of Famer?
The Associated Press
Frank Gore has spent 14 years in the National Football League and has accumulated 
14,478 rushing yards, the fourth-highest total in history.

WEDNESDAYSback-to-back double-digit losses to 
Vanderbilt at the end of that stretch.
The team used the friendly con-
fines of Alfred A. McKethan Stadi-
um to its advantage to regain some 
leverage against SEC competition.
UF swept Alabama, outscoring 
the Tide 21-7, using a balanced at-
tack from the mound and the bat-
ter’s box to potentially turn a cor-
ner as the halfway point of the SEC 
slate drew near.
Unfortunately for Florida, 
not all games could be played in 
Gainesville. It dropped eight of the 
next nine conference road games, 
including sweeps to Georgia and 
Ole Miss.
Sitting at 29-21 overall and 9-15 
in conference play, the Gators were 
in danger of missing their first 
NCAA Tournament since before 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan took over 
in 2008.
UF used an impressive come-back to edge Tennessee 10-9 in the 
first game of the series, but back-
to-back one-run losses to the Vol-
unteers to wrap up the team’s final 
home series of 2019 had Florida on 
the outside looking in when it came 
to NCAA postseason play.
The team did what it needed 
to in its final series of the regular 
season however, picking up a road 
series sweep against the Missouri 
Tigers.
This time the pitching staff 
picked up the offense, holding the 
Tigers to seven runs total during the 
series, including a complete-game 
shutout from starter Jack Leftwich 
in Game 2.
At this point, an early exit from 
the SEC Tournament didn’t matter. 
The team’s resume was too impres-
sive to leave it out of the NCAAs.
The Gators were invited to the 
Lubbock Regional as the three seed, 
along with Texas Tech, Dallas Bap-
tist and Army.
Although Florida didn’t end up advancing out of Lubbock, its re-
siliency and fight late in the season 
caught the eye of the manager, and 
there’s excitement moving into next 
year on the mound.
“Obviously we’re all disappoint-
ed with the game today and how 
the season ended,” O’Sullivan said 
in a release after Sunday’s game. 
“But Christian Scott has shown a lot 
of improvement. Got a bright future 
moving forward. Get back Tommy 
(Mace) and Jack (Leftwich)… Jack 
was great at the end of the year, 
and Tommy obviously had a couple 
good starts at the end of the year.”
In the batter’s box, the loss of 
Nelson Maldonado will hurt, along 
with the possible departures of 
Austin Langworthy and Wil Dalton. 
Brady McConnell, the team’s best 
hitter, likely won’t return to school 
next year either — he was taken in 
the second round of the MLB Draft 
on Monday. But a team that had a 
roster which featured 21 freshmen 
and sophomores in 2019 still has a 
lot to look forward to next season.
@evanmplepak
elepak@alligator.orgBASEBALL,  from pg. 10UF went 6 -12 on the road
cannot be understated, and the void 
that now forms in their absence is 
recognized by Walton.
“We have some major holes to fill 
– and the expectations aren’t chang-
ing,” Walton said in a release. “We 
have an extremely long way to go 
between now and next February to 
be relevant again.”
As for next season, the core of the 
team will be built around returning 
players including second basemen 
Hannah Adams, designated hitter 
Kendyl Lindaman, catcher Jordan 
Roberts and shortstop Sophia Reyno-so, among others.
Michigan State transfer Charla 
Echols, who hit .359 with seven 
home runs in 2019, should provide 
a welcome addition to a Florida of-
fense that struggled to gain traction 
the entire season.
Though it will take time to adjust 
to life in the post-Barnhill and Lo-
renz era, Walton knows all too well 
about returning to a championship 
level, and the Gators should quickly 
get back to their winning ways.
