Three candidates have emerged for Student Body 
president, all of which send the message of giving Student 
Government a makeover. 
New parties who have recently filled their Executive 
ticket said they intend to bring SG back to the students and to stop partisan-based bickering. 
The Progress Party announced Sunday it filled its 
Executive ticket with senators from both the Gator Party and the Orange and Blue Party, the only two parties cur -
rently holding seats in Student Senate. 
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Dictor, who announced 
his intent to run for Student Body president in December, will run alongside vice-presidential candidate and Gator Party Sen. Heshan Illangkoon, according to Josh Simmons, 
party president. 
Simmons said Gator Party Sen. Jose Ortega, who repre-
sents UF’s Fisher School of Accounting, will run as Student 
Body treasurer. 
Simmons said the Progress Party opted not to interview 
candidates but chose them based on past SG experience and leadership.
“He’s the best student leader I’ve seen,” he said. “I’m 
graduating in May, so I get no personal benefit from 
(Dictor’s election).” SG parties fill

A hearing was held Friday to 
determine if UF improperly laid 
off Andrea Pham, assistant profes-
sor of Vietnamese language and linguistics.
A decision on Friday’s hearing 
should be reached within 60 days.
Pham was one of eight faculty 
members and 65 staff given layoff 
notices after last year’s $47 million budget cut. 
Pham and two others, Czech language and linguistics assistant professor Hana Filip and Swahili 
language and 
literature lectur -
er Rose Lugano, 
filed grievances 
with UF after they were given layoff notices, said Angel Kwolek-Folland, UF’s assistant provost.
Pham’s grievance is the only 
one that has reached the point of 
arbitration, which is the third and 
final stage of the process.
The grievances filed by Filip and 
Lugano are currently in the second stage and could be resolved before arbitration, Kwolek-Folland said.
Of seven laid-off faculty mem-
bers in the College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences, which had to cut 
about $6 million, all were foreign-born and six were women. Tenure-track professor challenges layoff

Recent college graduates are choosing 
graduate school over full-time jobs, as the 
failing economy makes it more difficult to 
find and keep work.
This is not uncommon, UF spokesman 
Steve Orlando said. 
“You see this when the economy down-turns and people can’t get jobs,” he said.
UF is still collecting updated graduate 
school application data, but Orlando said UF 
graduate school applications have recently 
surged. Although budget cuts forced UF to 
reduce undergraduate enrollment, graduate 
schools are not affected, he said.
Unlike undergraduate programs, UF’s 
graduate school is not supported by grants or research funding, two areas that face cuts.
Students may choose to 
further their education in-
stead of facing a job-hunt 
in the struggling economy, 
but they shouldn’t wait un-
til the last minute to make that choice, said Wayne 
Wallace, the director of 
UF’s Career Resource Center.Getting into graduate school is just as 
competitive as finding a job. Particularly, as the number of people competing for admit-
tance rises.
“Everybody can’t go to grad school if 
they don’t like the job market,” he said.
Planning for graduate school starts be-
fore senior year, and students should fill out 
graduate school and job applications.As economy fails, many choose grad school over workSEE hEARING, PAGE 8

BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Police say two female teenag-
ers were arrested on charges of beating a Papa John’s delivery man and stealing dinner they allegedly ordered: pizza, wings and a cheese steak that cost $55.
Boynton Beach police officers arrested the teenagers Thursday and 
found the still-warm pizzas in a closet. Arrested were Valerie Blanc and Michelle Turner, both 19. A witness told detectives she saw the two suspects leave the house and attack the pizza delivery man. He had been trying to deliver three pizzas — extra cheese, pepperoni and ham — in addition to a 10-piece order of buffalo wings with blue-cheese dressing and a 2-liter bottle of Coke when he was attacked.n Gainesville

Jim McCauley , service foreman

— RACHAEL PINO     Library glass panel breaks
Library West’s escalators came 
to a halt Friday morning when a 
technician broke the inside glass panel of the up escalator during a routine maintenance check. 
The escalator was shut down, 
forcing students to access the floor above via the library’s single, ground-floor elevator for most of Friday afternoon. Some students, unwilling to wait, ran up the down escalator against the regular flow of traffic. 
Workers constructed a tem-
porary wooden barrier over the weekend so the escalator could stay in service.

the maintenance and the break, ThyssenKrupp, is looking for a local replacement, since the esca-lator’s original panel was manu-LOCAL
Ice cream mogul visits
Ice cream fans got a chance to 
meet Ben & Jerry’s co-founder Jerry Greenfield at the store’s Archer Road location Friday night.
Greenfield came to kick off the 
ice cream chain’s new boxed choc-olates inspired by flavors such as Imagine Whirled Peace and Phish Food, said Pete Zimek, the co-own-er of the Archer Road franchise.
The store is one of eight in the 
U.S. selling the chocolates.
Outside the store, the Ben & 
Jerry’s mascot cow danced and 
hugged younger ice cream fans.
“I like eating it and licking it 
and letting it melt on my tongue,” 
said 4-year-old Piercen Bogolea.
Inside, about 50 people sampled 
chocolate and purchased ice cream cartons for Greenfield to sign.
Greenfield’s arrival sent a buzz 
through the crowd, as customers 
moved to meet him.
“I’m beyond words,” said 
Greenfield, whose daughter, 
Lindsay , is a sophomore at UF.  “I’m happy. I’m thrilled to be here.”

He has been called Superman, 
but never before has Tim Tebow 
been called a knight. And yet, to 
the people of Hoggetowne, that is 
exactly what he is. 
He is a great knight, great of 
stature and great among men, 
said David Reed, a horn herald for 
Hoggetowne’s king and queen. 
The nation of Hoggetowne 
wants to be on good terms with 
Tebow and The Gator Nation, he 
said.
The two nations mingled 
Saturday and Sunday at the 23rd 
annual Hoggetowne Medieval Faire, sponsored by the City of 
Gainesville.
The Faire will resume this Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday.
The Gator Nation should 
know that the members of the Hoggetowne Medieval Faire are a 
bit, well, different.                         
Instead of capturing children 
and selling them as slaves, as a 
dishonorable Hoggetowne gypsy 
would do, Erinn Rose Koch Riker, 
also known as Lady Gypsy Rose, 
said she dances and sells jewelry 
and handkerchiefs.                                                    
Being a gypsy has a mystique to 
it, said Lady Gypsy Rose.                                                             
“I use that to my advantage,” she said.                 
But Vladimir, also a Hoggetowne 
gypsy, said there are a lot of miscon-ceptions about gypsies.    
“They’re actually very honor -
able people, but their conception of 
society is different from everyone else’s,” he said.
Artisans and royalty also grace 
Hoggetowne.
There’s Chelsea Burke, who 
owns the Gypsy Tails booth and sells hair extensions in braided 
shades of bubble gum pink, red, 
blue and brown.                                                               
There’s John Hoke, or Sir John 
the Rosedipper, who sells waxed 
roses that last forever. There’s even a 
King William and a Queen Caroline, 
who have attended a Gator game. 
Linda Piper, the Faire’s coordinator, said about 12,000 people attended o n  S a t u r d a y  a n d  9 , 0 0 0  o n  S u n d a y.                                                                        
The merchants come from as 
far as California, Oklahoma and Tennessee, and each year the Faire allows them to reunite, Piper said.      Chris Hernandez, 23, a Gainesville 
medic, said the Faire is a fun, whole-
some  event.                                                 
“I guess it’s just a simple excuse 
for people to unify over a simple 
cause,” he said.              
People watched jousting by the 
New Riders of the Golden Age and saw Kitty Tolson Carroll’s  Birds of 
the Gauntlet program.In a living chess match,  players 
dressed as chess pieces acted out a 
game. Jen Shumilak, who plays the mandolin and the concertina for the dancers, said Morris dancing re-
newed national pride in England.       
Whether it serves the same pur -
pose in Hoggetowne is unclear, but one thing is certain, “Everything old is new again, right,” Shumilak 
said. “Everything that started then comes back around.”Gypsies, merchants, jousters among those at Faire4, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009

A UF baseball player was arrested and charged 
with driving under the influence early Saturday 
morning after he was seen swerving into oncom-ing traffic on West University Avenue.
Stephen Locke, 22, was arrested after he re-
fused to take a field sobriety test. 
According to the Gainesville Police Department 
arrest report, a police officer saw the senior pitch-er driving 10 mph under the speed limit on West University Avenue in a black Mercury SUV .
Locke swerved across lanes and the double 
yellow line, forcing oncoming traffic to swerve to avoid hitting him, the report stated.
According to the report, GPD Officer Daniel 
Surrency watched Locke cross into the outside lane and into the bicycle lane, almost hitting the curb.
When Locke was pulled over, Surrency wrote 
in the report that he could smell alcohol on Locke’s breath.
According to the report, 
Locke’s eyes were bloodshot and watery, and his speech was slurred. 
Locke swayed while stand-
ing and leaned on his vehicle for balance when he stepped out of the car. He was also wearing an arm band from Grog House, a bar in midtown.
Because Locke refused to take a field sobri-
ety test, he was arrested and brought into GPD. Upon arrival, Locke also refused to submit to a 
breath test.
Locke was charged with driving under the in-
fluence. UF athlete charged with DUI
 ABOUT 320 PEOPLE 
GATHERED AT UF HILLEL.

About 320 people attended 
a Friday memorial for Michelle 
Moses, 21, a fourth-year UF el-ementary education major who died over winter break while 
driving home to Mason, Ohio, a 
suburb of Cincinnati.
Friends and family shared 
memories with a sniffling crowd on the second floor of UF Hillel for about 45 minutes, with many in attendance wearing green Alpha Epsilon Phi shirts, repre-senting the sorority Moses be-
longed to.
Walking up to the lectern and 
taking a look at the size of the 
crowd, Michelle’s brother, Ben Moses, joked, “I always thought that I was the popular one.”
But Moses, a student at the 
University of Miami, said he re-
membered the days when his sis-
ter was younger and much more reserved.“I remember when I used to 
order for her at restaurants be-cause she was too shy,” he said.
He said he and Michelle were 
like peas in a pod and never fought, because Michelle was “the easiest person in the world to get along with.”
Michelle’s father, Garry Moses, 
said his daughter loved her soror -
ity sisters and was proud of her Jewish heritage.
“She loved the world, loved 
where she was, loved who she was with,” he said.
Michael Jellis, Michelle’s boy-
friend, said the two could talk about anything, but there was one thing they would only whisper to 
each other. “But I wanna say it a 
bit louder so everyone else can hear,” Jellis told the crowd.
“I love you, Michelle,” he said 
with his voice trembling. “I’ll miss you for the rest of my life.”Friends, family hold

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
COLEMAN, Fla. — A fight 
broke out at a federal prison 
northwest of Orlando on Sunday afternoon and eight inmates have been hospitalized, includ-
ing one with a gunshot wound, 
a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said.
A “large-scale fight” broke 
out in the recreation yard serving a high-security building at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex, spokeswoman Traci Billingsley said.No staff workers were seri-
ously injured and the condition of the inmates, all of them male, 
was not immediately available, 
Billingsley told The Associated Press.
Asked later 
Sunday about the injuries, she later told AP that “one 
is gunshot, but I don’t know about the others.” She said she 
had no further details about the 
fighting and how it began.
The Orlando Regional 
Medical Center confirmed Sunday that seven people were under treatment after being tak-en there. It was unclear where 
the eighth inmate was taken 
and hospital officials declined to identify them by name and give details on their conditions.
The prison has four units that 
house low-, medium- and high-security inmates. Billingsley said the fight erupted in a yard at one of the two high-security units at 
the federal complex, which is lo-
cated about 50 miles northwest of Orlando and 60 miles north-east of Tampa.Jail brawl ends with 8 injuredLOCAL

One college at UF used the cre-
ativity of its students last week to 
save between $1,000 and $2,500 in 10 hours.
Rather than hiring profession-
als, groups affiliated with UF’s College of Design, Construction & Planning asked students to participate in an intensive de-sign session aimed at improv-ing the Architecture Building’s work spaces. Forty-three students worked from noon to 10 p.m. on Wednesday, during the “Pride in Place Charrette”. 
They came from a variety of 
specializations, including archi-tecture, interior design, landscape architecture and urban and re-gional planning. Students worked in groups of up to three people to design an outdoor seating area, studio work station or an area to hang banners advertising for the college. Each design was limited to a budget of $10,000.
“The value of a charrette is that 
you get a lot of very different ideas 
very quickly,” said UF Professor 
Tina Gurucharri, interim chair in 
the department of landscape archi-
tecture. The top two designs, to be cho-
sen by some faculty and students from the college, will be announced today. The first-place design will be awarded $750, while second place will receive $250. One win-ning project will be put to use.
Student involvement in the 
manufacturing and installation of the project will depend on the de-sign selected, said Peggy Carr, the college’s associate dean for under -
graduate students and academic affairs. Some students said the ex-perience went beyond just having monetary value.
Dorota Tomaszewska, a UF in-
terior design junior, said the char -
rette was a great experience be-cause it allowed her and a fellow interior design major to work and share ideas with a landscape archi-tecture major.                                                              
“And also it wasn’t for a 
grade,” Tomaszewska said. “It wasn’t something we were forced to do. We were all there willing to do that.”

 ITEMS INCLUDED SPATULAS,ARMADILLOS AND LIGHT SABERS.

Over 70 collectors showcased every-
thing from Simpsons’ toys and spatulas to 
political buttons and World War II memo-rabilia Saturday at the Florida Natural 
History Museum’s 30th Annual Collectors 
Day.
Saturday’s event took over both the in-
side and outside of the museum, as collec-tors sat behind eight-foot-long tables filled 
with  prized possessions, while the largest 
collection of restored automobiles packed the circular driveway. 
The event was created to highlight how 
collections are the foundation of a mu-seum, said Tiffany Ireland, the museum’s 
education assistant.
Co-coordinator of the event, Kelly 
Donovan, agreed.
“(Collecting is) a science, but it doesn’t 
have to be stuffy,” said Donovan. 
While some displays held more tra-
ditional treasures such as stamps and bi-
bles, others were dedicated to pop culture icons.  
Light sabers and a Darth Vader mask 
made up Christina and Sean Geiger’s col-lection, for example.
The couple, who met at a 
Star Wars convention, now has a collection valued at 
about $50,000.
“People say our house is a Star Wars 
museum,” Christina Geiger said.
Other collections were a little more 
rare. 
Bonnie Bernau sat behind a table filled 
with various figures of armadillos.
Bernau has been collecting them since 1981, after she struggled through a diffi-cult time in her life. 
“It’s a metaphor for taking care of 
yourself,” said Bernau, who has a tin full of a crushed armadillo shell taken from a 
Georgian roadside. “I always remember not to get squashed on the highway of 
life.” 
Don Dekeid, 68, who has attended 
Collectors Day for a number of years, said he enjoys the stories behind the collec-
tions. 
“It gives you an exposure to people’s 
interests and what they’ve done over the years,” he said.Collectors show off unique items at UF museum event

Dessert demigod 
descends upon G-ville
FOX News ascends from media gutter
Today’s question: Is MSNBC the 
new FOX News?Friday’s question: Is society too dependent on technology?
210 TOTAL VOTES73% YES27% NOWithin a time frame of three days last week, 
President Barack Obama symbolically undid many of ‘43’s more controversial policies. 
Lifting the ban on federal funding for stem cell re-
search. Check. Ending the “Abortion Gag-Rule,” where U.S. monies were forbidden to fall into the coffers of international organizations that provided information 
about abortion. Check. Signing an executive order clos-
ing the Gitmo detention camp and placing a hold on “en-hanced interrogation techniques.” Check.
MSNBC and CNN’s graphic lackeys may toil away 
on all the “First 100 Days” images they want, but Obama seems intent on sprinting to the arbitrary finish line. 
He had such a marathon last week in halting many of 
President George W. Bush’s policies, that I can’t watch 
my favorite television networks anymore. MSNBC and 
CNN, or the “liberal media elite” as Gov. Sarah Palin labeled them, have gone bonkers with coverage of Obamamania. 
So far, CNN’s most vocal complaint has been that 
Yo-Yo Ma’s performance at the inauguration was prere-corded. 
MSNBC is even worse. On inauguration day, Chris 
Matthews announced to his audience that MSNBC was 
now the Obama network. 
Of course, MSNBC and CNN are no different from the 
other standard-bearers in the print-liberal media elite. 
The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and other 
bastions of journalism are simply following the political 
climate: Obama’s approval ratings are historically high for an incoming president, and Bush’s ratings leaving of-fice are historically low. 
Actually, the landscape is strikingly similar to the weeks following 9/11, when President Bush’s cowboy de-meanor comforted the nation, 
and his very rash and diplomati-
cally insidious taunts to capture the terrorists “dead-or-alive” only served to shore up his image as 
the supreme commander in chief. 
This, of course, made his pleads for Americans to “go shopping” 
all the more moving. 
Journalistic objectivity was lost in the months after 
9/11 and in the lead up to the Iraq War in March of 2003. 
The social and political climate demanded retribution for the horrific attacks — helping FOX News make its name 
and creating a bias favoring the Bush administration’s 
handling on just about everything. Not to mention secur -
ing exclusive interviews with the president and his shifty vice along the way. 
Now, just as our past presidential election demanded 
change from the Bush Era, MSNBC and CNN find them-selves as the new preferred networks of the administra-tion, willing to sacrifice objectivity for ratings. 
It is in this spirit, that for the first time last week, I 
switched from my preferred liberal media outlet over to FOX News, home of the sniveling and arrogant Bill O’Reilly. Unfortunately, from FOX News, I did enjoy some final objectivity to judge the man — not the super -
man — sitting in the Oval Office. 
Just don’t expect me to buy a T-shirt from the online 
“O’Reilly Store” anytime this decade.    
Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His column 
appears on Mondays.Budget bully
To find signs of the 
failing economy, you don’t have to look 
much further than the cur -
rent budget crisis at UF.
As courses are cut and 
professors lose their jobs, the 
Editorial Board wants to en-
sure situations like the one surrounding Andrea Pham don’t become commonplace.
Pham, a Vietnamese lan-
guage and linguistics assis-tant professor, is challenging the decision by the univer -
sity to relieve her from her duties at UF. 
Her argument stems from 
the fact that language in her 
contract dictates that faculty 
members with the least se-niority should be the first to lose their positions.
As a linguistics professor 
in addition to Vietnamese instructor, Pham suggests she could have taught other classes that are still being of-fered at UF. 
Contending the layoff vi-
olates the terms of her union contract. Pham had an ar -
bitration hearing on Friday with hopes of reversing her 
fate.
While the Editorial Board 
understands the process of 
laying off professors and 
eliminating classes is cer -
tainly not an easy one, we 
would hope Pham did not unfairly lose her job.
With seven years at the 
university, Pham clearly has made a positive impact at the university and seemingly 
was on the right path toward 
receiving tenure.
We can’t help but ques-
tion why did Pham suffer such a fate when there were 
eight other individuals in her 
department with less experi-ence than her?The Editorial Board knows a little something about junk food.
Let’s just say there may or may not be an overflow-
ing box of goodies ranging from animal crackers to Pop-Tarts waiting to be eaten in the middle of the newsroom.
When we heard Ben & Jerry’s very own Jerry Greenfield 
visited Gainesville on Friday, our hearts sank a bit knowing 
we could’ve had our ice cream scooped by a living legend.
From flavors like Cherry Garcia to Phish Food, the ex-
hippies Ben & Jerry have concocted some of the best waist-
line expanding desserts known to man. While we certainly don’t mind the occasional jaunt to Cold Stone Creamery or 
The Gelato Company, there is something to be said about 
Ben & Jerry’s overload of mix-ins guaranteed in every bite. 
We can only imagine how cool it would have been to talk 
with Greenfield about the humble beginnings of setting up 
an ice cream shop at an abandoned gas station in Vermont.
Greenfield is living the dream — no longer involved 
with the day-to-day operations of the company — he is free 
to travel the country promoting the brand and relishing in his celebrity.
Whether it’s a midnight run to the The Pantry at the lo-
cal Kangaroo or getting a cone at the store on University Avenue, there is no denying that Ben & Jerry’s is an ice cream institution college students will continue to crave for 
generations to come.
Excuse us while we put down our pints and make our -
selves a garden salad.

Letters to the Editor
Obama foreign policy nothing new
Over the weekend, President Barack 
Obama authorized missile strikes into 
Pakistan that killed 21 people, mostly ci-
vilians. 
The Pakistani government has urged 
the United States to stop these strikes and 
respect the sovereignty of the country.
However, Obama has signaled no in-
tention to do so.
Although Obama has made many im-
provements over the Bush administra-tion in several issues, most notably with Guantanamo Bay, his actions in Pakistan have shown that he is not going to substan-tially deviate from the imperialist policies set by his predecessor. 
In addition, he has promised to escalate 
the war in Afghanistan, something that can only result in more antagonism from the Middle East and the creation of a new generation of terrorists. 
Anyone who values peace needs to 
seize this opportunity to pressure Obama to keep the promises he made during the campaign to change the direction of United States foreign policy.

Towing company lacks compassion
Cheers to Hunter Sizemore and the 
Alligator for calling out Ultimate Towing. 
We were all extremely disturbed to read 
how Ashley Gregg was recently treated by 
one of their drivers. 
Even though we were not there to witness 
the incident as it unfolded, it is very easy for us to imagine the completely rude and dis-respectful manner she was spoken, to as we watch it happen all the time. 
We have often been accused of this same 
thing, but it is usually warranted, and we don’t steal cars. 
The fact that Gregg is physically disabled 
makes this even more appalling. 
We are offended as longtime Gainesville 
residents and as humans. 
Gregg deserves an apology and much 
more from Driver No. 426 and Ultimate Towing.

My parents’ generation did acid. My 
generation does Facebook.
Drugs and social networking 
sites both function similarly to deliver a su-perficial reality, a diversion from the mun-
dane. At least drugs provide a high. What is 
Facebook’s high?
Facebook, like a heavily addictive drug, 
can, for some people, run their lives. They check it during breakfast, again in lecture, again after lecture, 12 times while doing homework and then again right before bed. This column is taking a vast amount of self-control to write with the intense craving for 
a Facebook contact high looming in the back 
of my mind ... or rather front of my mind.
(Takes a writing break to check 
Facebook.)
I can’t help but wonder how much more 
productive I would be without it. In my Facebook-free fantasy, I would sit down to write a paper and not immediately get swept away with the thought that, perhaps, some-
one has written on my wall. Or that perhaps 
there are new tagged photos of me. I would instead have an uninterrupted stream of academic thought, finishing my paper in re-cord time. 
Alas, this fantasy 
world doesn’t ex-ist, and Facebook does. Thus I am left 
to wonder why our 
generation is so hooked on using social net-
working sites as pastimes.
I asked my brother, Adam Hein, why 
he logs on. “It’s an ego boost,” he said. “It makes you feel like you have a life even when you don’t.” 
And for someone like my brother, a grad-
uate of Chapman University’s film school 
and a film production assistant who works 
upward of 12 hours a day, a momentary re-minder that his social life still exists is com-forting.
While most of us in college have hyperac-
tive social lives, we still have nights where we have to blow off friends in order to do work. It is on those nights that I find myself most tempted to log onto Facebook. I sup-
pose it’s a comfort to know that even when 
I have stayed in to do work, I am still with friends, if only online.
The gossip aspect of Facebook, most of-ten referred to as “Facebook-stalking” has become a widely accepted way to obtain in-timate information about your peers, and I know quite a few addicts. Recently, when I mentioned to friends that I have a new boy-
friend, the common response was “hold on, 
let me Facebook-stalk him.” 
The instant delivery of otherwise un-
knowable facts is another highly stimulating aspect of Facebook.
As thrilling as getting caught up in a vir -
tual fantasy land is, we could just as easily be spending time participating in real inter -
actions with friends. But Facebook facilitates 
real social interactions as well. The likeli-
hood that you would be invited to half of the events that you are via Facebook, if it didn’t exist, is slim. 
And thus Facebook truly does stimulate 
your real social life as well.
The convenience has made junkies out 
of us all. It’s convenient to sit down at your computer and click through pictures of 
friends you haven’t seen since elementary 
school. It’s satisfying to revel at your 500-plus friend count and imagine that you truly are friends with all of those people.And all of these aspects are what make 
it so addictive. You can get carried away thinking about your plans for the upcoming weekend on top of all of the ego-stroking and friend-stalking. It is so much more sa-
tiating in that way than focusing on home-
work, and so we allow ourselves to be swept away by it all too frequently.
What did we ever do before Facebook? 
Did we find ourselves more productive, as I would like to believe we would be without it? No. We simply found other virtual ways to distract ourselves. We watched more TV , we played more video games. 
Facebook isn’t necessarily taking up more 
of our time, it is simply replacing the time we would have otherwise spent in front of the “boob tube.” And at least Facebook has the benefit of networking, both for business and for pleasure.
I’ve got that itch again to check my pro-
file. That desire to break focus and submerge myself in my synthetic social life.
I guess I’ll just take another hit of 
Facebook. I’m not doing my homework any-way.

Facebook frenzy: The new opiate of the collegiate masses
Natalie Hein
U-Wire8, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009
By spring break, most students should know what 
they’re doing after graduation.
“If you don’t get accepted and you don’t get a job, 
then after you graduate you’re home with mom,” 
Wallace said.
Stephanie DeLisser, a first-year UF graduate stu-
dent, said the slumping job market played a role in her decision to apply to graduate school.
Delisser, 22, had trouble finding jobs with entry-
level positions in her field of drug rehabilitation coun-
seling.
“It was frustrating,” she said.
She enrolled in graduate school to get more experi-
ence and become more competitive.
But she said students who don’t choose to continue 
their education have other options.
They could consider internships, work outside 
their preferred field, or even commute for work, 
DeLisser said.
“Just keep trying,” she said.Dwindling jobs raise 
graduate applicationsBut Pham’s attorney, Tom Brooks, 
dropped a discrimination charge 
early in Friday’s hearing.
After the hearing, Pham said that 
she has filed a discrimination com-plaint with the Florida Commission on Human Relations, which is better 
suited to hear those charges.
Her attorney instead argued that UF broke its contract with the United 
Faculty of Florida, the faculty union.
Under the contract, Brooks ar -
gued, UF could only eliminate certain organi-zational units, 
like departments or programs, and 
the two Vietnamese courses Pham 
teaches that are being cut did not constitute a proper organizational unit.
Brooks also argued that there 
were others in Pham’s department 
with less experience.
Pham, a tenure-track professor 
who is in her seventh year at UF, is 
scheduled to lose her job on June 10. She said she likes UF and hopes she’s 
allowed to stay and attain tenure.
“That’s what I’m fighting for,” 
she said.8 faculty, 65 staff members fired last year
He said the Progress Party will hold a informative 
rally in Plaza of the Americas today at 1 p.m.   
Meanwhile, after interviewing nine applicants on 
Friday, the Unite Party announced its vice presidential 
candidate, Larnell Vickers, along with Maryam Laguna, candidate for Student Body treasurer on Sunday. Both candidates have been involved with SG in the past.                                                                    
Unite Party President William Harrell said the party 
sought hard workers with long-term goals.
Many of the applicants who came to interview with the party agreed with its mantra, such as Budgets and Appropriations Committee Chairman Sen. Brandon 
White of the Gator Party.
“I want to get happy people in Student Government. 
It’s become so serious,” said White, who interviewed for 
treasurer. 
The Orange and Blue Party’s candidate for Student 
Body President, Mark McShera, will begin interviews on Jan. 30 to choose his running mates. 
So far, nine parties have registered for this year’s elec-
tion, including the LAN Party and the Keg Party, accord-
ing to Supervisor of Elections Dan Siegel. Registration 
ends Friday at noon. Three candidates chosen promise SG changehearing , from page 1

Alligator Writer

It’s hard to relax for even just a 
couple minutes in the Southeastern 
Conference.After dominating for 33 minutes 
on Sunday and building a 23-point 
lead, UF looked like it could have 
just mailed it in with 6:38 remain-
ing.
The Gators appeared to do 
just that, and 2 1/2 minutes later, Mississippi (13-7, 2-3 SEC) had the 
lead down to 10 with 4:08 left.
Freshman guard Trumae Lucas 
did her part to seal the win, nailing a 
three from the corner just moments 
later and propelling No. 15 UF (18-
2, 4-1 SEC) to a 75-54 victory against the Rebels in front of 4,623 fans, the 
eighth-largest crowd in O’Connell 
Center history.
“I just knew that we had to keep 
playing aggressive and that they 
were going to trap on the wings,” 
Lucas said. “(Sha) Brooks found me 
and I knocked it down.”
With Brooks having an off day 
shooting, Lucas picked up the slack 
on both ends of the flooring, tallying 
13 points and four steals.
“I always have to be ready ,” 
Lucas said. “You can never count on 
one person to carry the team, so I’m 
always ready to step up or do what-
ever the team needs me to.”
The key to UF’s success all sea-
son has been jumping out on teams early.
Sunday was no different, as the 
Gators opened a 12-point lead eight 
minutes into the game, thanks most-
ly to Marshae Dotson’s effort.
The senior forward scored UF’s 
first 9 points.
“We know as a group that we are 
our best when we are up on our toes and when we’re setting the tone and when we’re coming out … swinging first and hopefully landing that first 
punch,” UF coach Amanda Butler 
said.
Butler was most proud of her 
team’s ability to be balanced and 
consistent.
All 10 players who saw action 
scored, and four were in double fig-
ures.
“It’s really hard to key on one 
thing to beat us,” Butler said.
The Gators outrebounded the 
Rebels by 10, something Butler said 
was the biggest contributing factor 
in the win.
UF has locked down defensively 
in the last three games as well, hold-
ing its three opponents to 54, 45 and 63 points, respectively.
Mississippi coach Renee Ladner 
said her team took a beating from UF’s physical style of play, a testa-
ment to the Gators’ toughness de-
fensively.
“It goes back to us really having 
confidence in our bench,” Butler 
said. “It allows us to play as aggres-
sively as we want.”
Ladner also gave her assessment 
of where the Gators stand right now.
“They’re playing with a lot of 
confidence and a lot of swagger,” said Ladner, a former UF assistant. 
“The crowd was a big factor. I give a 
lot of credit to Florida, though. They popped us in the mouth.”
“Florida is one of the top teams 
in our conference,” Ladner added. “I 
definitely would agree with that.”14, ALLIGATOR  MONDAY, JANUARY 26, 2009
 CARLOS PHILLIPS WON FIRST 
PLACE IN THE 800-METER RUN.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
The O’Connell Center resembled The 
Swamp during the men’s 4x400-meter re-
lays: You could not hear yourself breathe, 
if you even had time to breathe, and you definitely could not hear a pin drop.
Fans’ cheers engulfed the building and 
willed UF’s primary men’s relay team to a 
first-place finish and an NCAA provisional 
qualifying time of 3:09.38.
“The relays, especially the 4x400, that’s 
our tradition, we have to win it,” senior 
Carlos Phillips said. “It’s our home track, 
so we can’t let somebody come in and take our trophy.” 
Phillips ran the second leg of the relay 
and finished the day with another provi-
sional qualifying time, in the 800-meter run. He took first place with a time of 1:49.86 in 
the 800.
“Carlos has just gotten a little bit better 
each and every year,” coach Mike Holloway 
said. “He’s a senior leader, and we expect 
that from him.”
Junior sprinter Terrell Wilks, after com-
ing off an average performance against Kentucky, shined in front of the home crowd. 
Wilks ran a provisional qualifying time 
of 6.25 seconds to capture second place in the 55-meter dash. 
He also placed fifth in the 200-meter 
dash, and ran the third leg on UF’s fourth-place 4x400 men’s relay team.
“For me personally, today was better than 
last week,” Wilks said. “The team overall, I 
think we did better than last week, too.”
Mariam Kevkhishvili, a junior shot-put-
ter, outdid her NCAA automatic-qualifying 
throw from the Kentucky Invitational. 
Kevkhishvili threw the shot 56 feet, more than 3 feet farther than her teammate, Keely Medeiros, who took second place.
“I can do so much better than I did today, 
I know it’s coming,” Kevkhishvili said.
Holloway applauded Kevkhishvili’s 
consistency.
“I’m always impressed with Mariam be-
cause it’s not easy to do that every week” Holloway said. “We are very pleased but 
not satisfied with where 
she is. Neither is she satis-
fied, that’s why she’s the NCAA defending cham-pion.”
UF had solid field per -
formances from Fidela James, who took home sec-ond place in the women’s 
weight throw, Jenna Utecht, who finished fifth in high jump, and Janicia McFadden, who was 10th in the women’s long jump.
Natalie Moser took second place in 
women’s pole vault with the vault at 12 feet, 11.5 inches. Daisy Glasser came in sixth, Lauren Menke took seventh and Alex Black tied for ninth.
In the men’s pole vault, at 16 feet, 0.75 
inches, Justin Semeyn took third place while Eric Foran and Gray Horn finished fifth and tied for eighth, respectively.
Beau Burroughs threw the shot 56 feet, 
3.75 inches to take third place in the shot put and Joshua Postell was fifth in the triple 
jump.
The track events proved to be more suc-
cessful on the day for the Gators.
In the 3,000-meter run, Charlotte 
Browning ran a 9:45.32 to take second place, 
Jacy Kruzel came in fourth, Sara Petrick was fifth and Laura Garrow took sixth.
On the men’s side, Jeremy Hall took 
fourth place in the 55 dash and Michael Anderson was fourth in the men’s 3,000-meter run. 
“I thought we had a very good day today, 
solid across the board,” Holloway said.UF track teams show home crowd first-rate performance
Recruiting class’ low ranking caused by abundance of returning playersUF WOMEN’S BASkETBALLLucas’ three kills chances for Mississippi comeback
everyone is returning, so you can only bring in as many kids as 
you have scholarships for,” ESPN analyst Tom Luginbill said.
The Scout and Rivals rankings are based on a formula, with 
teams receiving points for their number of recruits and the rat-ings of those players. UF has 16 commitments so far, the lowest 
number of the top 25 on both Web sites, and there’s simply no 
room for a boatload of recruits.
The Gators should return 67 scholarship players for next 
year (barring anyone else leaving the team this off-season), which leaves 18 open slots for incoming recruits.
UF already has six recruits enrolled in school, leaving 12 
scholarships to fill by National Signing Day on Feb. 4, and 10 
of those spaces are occupied by verbal commit-ments.
ESPN values UF’s recruiting class higher than 
competing Web sites, ranking it No. 5 in large part because, as Luginbill says, recruiting isn’t 
just a numbers game.
“I actually think the class is really strong,” he 
said. “I think they’re doing a great job filling needs, and (high-
ly-touted receiver) Andre Debose was a huge, huge pickup just because of the departure of Percy Harvin. Filling needs, more than anything else, should truly be the factor that people look at when you talk about a recruiting class.”
Luginbill lists the nation’s top-rated outside linebacker 
(Maryland native Jelani Jenkins) and cornerback (Alabama’s Dre Kirkpatrick) as strong possibilities to land in Gainesville.
“I think it’s a very strong class, and in fact, I would venture 
to say that along with Alabama, Florida might have the most 
to gain in terms of being in on some top prospects going down 
the stretch here as anybody between now and signing day ,” Luginbill said. “I think we could be having this conversation on Feb. 5 and saying, ‘Wow.’”katie Tschopp / Alligator

UF GYMNASTICS
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
The No. 1-ranked UF gymnas-
tics team had never lost a meet 
to Arkansas. They were 18-0 lifetime against the Razorbacks heading into Friday night’s meet. That’s when the Hogs 
fought back.
No. 8 Arkansas (3-1, 1-0 
Southeastern Conference) upset 
the Gators, winning 196.375-195.425 in Fayetteville, Ark. UF (2-1, 1-1 SEC) produced its 
lowest score of the season and 
once again struggled on balance beam.
Three Gators — Amanda 
Castillo, Corey Hartung and 
Alicia Goodwin — fell off beam, 
forcing the team to count two of its falls toward the final beam score (47.90).
“Having three falls at the 
end — those situations are not 
acceptable from our upperclass-
men because they’ve had experi-ence,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
Heading into beam, the Gators 
held a 0.525 lead over Arkansas. Troubles on beam coupled with 
the Hogs’ floor exercise score of 
49.375 doomed the Gators.
“They have to use this like 
our football team used the Ole Miss competition,” Faehn said.
“This is what’s going to light 
a fire underneath them to get back into the gym.”The Razorbacks claimed three 
event titles (vault, floor and 
beam). Once again, uneven bars 
was the Gators’ saving grace. 
They scored a 49.175 on bars.
The injury bug’s impact shone 
through brighter than ever dur -
ing the meet.
Injuries to Rebekah Zaiser, 
Amanda Castillo and now, fresh-man Nicole Ellis have all caused 
the team to scramble to make appropriate lineup changes.
Ellis performed on beam 
against Auburn, but hip surgery 
from last summer flared up at 
the last minute, forcing the beam 
lineup to change again.
“We have to get some athletes 
healthy because we’re strug-
gling to put a lineup out there on the floor, especially on bal-
ance beam,” Faehn said.
Freshman Elizabeth Mahlich 
debuted as an all-around per -
former. After meets in which she had performed exhibitions, she 
was promoted to the all-around category.
Mahlich finished the meet with an all-around score of 
39.325. The score was highest 
among the Gators and good for 
third overall.
Mahlich’s performance 
wasn’t the only freshman first. Kailey Tissue made her com-
petitive debut for UF, anchoring 
vault. Tissue scored a 9.875, plac-ing her in a tie for third overall 
along with teammate Maranda 
Smith.
Courtney Gladys also stepped 
up in light of a thinner Gators team. Gladys placed second 
overall on beam with a 9.875.
“I was really proud of 
Courtney for coming in on 
beam,” Faehn said. “She did a 
beautiful job, and she has po-
tential do to that every single 
time.”
Faehn is hoping the first loss 
of the season reveals the team’s 
lack of training, some of which 
is due to injuries.
“They may think they’re 
training hard,” Faehn said. “The 
coaching staff, we don’t feel that 
they are training hard enough.”
Faehn is just waiting to see 
how her team responds to a loss and hopes the team takes the 
loss in stride.
“This is a wake-up call,” 
Faehn said. “You cannot get lazy, you cannot get complacent. This is a great gymnastics team, but 
you cannot expect miracles to 
happen on the competition floor if you don’t put in the practice.”No. 1 Gators fall hard to Hogs
thrived behind the arc, going 15 for 25.
“We have a lot of guys who can shoot the three,” 
Erving Walker said. “When we get good looks, we ex-
pect to knock them down.”
Walker, who scored a career-high 17 points, was one 
of four Gators to score in double figures. 
Walter Hodge made his way into the stat sheet with 
10 points in the first half but failed to get on the board 
in the second.
Vanderbilt center A.J. Ogilvy played only 15 minutes 
and scored just 4 points in the game.
The Australian big man was slowed by plantar fascii-
tis, an inflamed tendon in the bottom of the foot.
“You could tell something was wrong with him,” 
Donovan said. “He just wasn’t himself.”Four players score 
in double figures
affect the way they played against the Commodores.
“I had to settle down a little bit,” Calathes said. “But 
we settled down and got the offense going. We ran the 
ball, and I think we tired them down a little bit.”
Walker, who had a career-high 17 points, noted the 
importance of the win for the Gators, who are off to a 4-1 
start in Southeastern Conference play.
“We needed this win in the worst way,” Walker said. 
“We didn’t want to drop to 3-2, and we wanted to show that we could win on the road.”
Walker said UF coach Billy Donovan continued to 
stress the importance of shooting with confidence be-fore the game. And going forward, it will be difficult for UF to be anything but confident after shooting 60 per -cent from 3-point range for the game, including 12-of-18 shooting in the first half.
“You’re always concerned when you are on the road 
in this league and you have a big lead,” Donovan said. “You don’t know how your team is going to respond. We were able to get off to a good start in the second half 
and build upon our lead, which gave us more confi-
dence and more momentum.”
Although the Gators had only seven 3-point attempts 
in the second half, their offensive attack did not lighten up. 
After halftime, UF instead focused on getting into the 
lane and attacking the basket. 
“It wasn’t so much that our shots were wide open or 
uncontested,” Donovan said. “We had so many guys at 
different spots making shots that it stretched the floor 
more than Vanderbilt wanted.”Team heeds advice to shoot with confidence CARLOS CUETO CLINCHED THE

In its second match of the season, the 
UF men’s tennis team knocked off a top-10 
team.
The Gators (2-0) defeated No. 7 Baylor 
7-0 on Sunday in front of an amped-up 
Linder Stadium crowd.“We needed some confidence, and 
we’ve earned some confidence against a 
very good team,” UF coach Andy Jackson said. “We also, frankly, understand that if 
we played again it could easily be 6-1, 7-0 
(in Baylor’s favor).”
The Bears (1-1) presented the challenge 
Jackson said the No. 10 Gators need.
The match-clinching victory came from 
Carlos Cueto, whose play lifted spectators to their feet.
The freshman defeated Baylor’s Denes 
Lukacs 6-0, 0-6, 6-3 on court No. 1.“After he won the first set, he made the 
big mistake of looking at the scoreboard,” Jackson said of Cueto’s dropped second 
set. “Once you do that, 
you distract yourself, your 
level goes down a bit and the other guy gets all over you.”
Cueto admitted to the 
blunder, saying he felt too 
relaxed after the quick start.
“In the first set, (Lukacs) was reaching 
and was really long and really deep,” he said. “But the second set, he was hitting balls really short. I was playing far behind. When the ball’s going deep, that’s good. But when they’re just bouncing there, he 
could do whatever he wanted with the 
ball.”
Yelling “Vamos!” the left-handed Cueto 
got his one-handed backhand working 
again in the deciding set and was met with 
roars of approval.
“Carlos was able to dig really, really 
deep and push through and get a win against a very good player,” Jackson said.UF builds confidence with upset shutout against Baylor

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A sleepless 
night for Chandler Parsons led to a long 
day for the Commodores.
The sophomore scored a career-high 
27 points and shot 7 for 8 from 3-point range as No. 24 UF (17-3, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) beat Vanderbilt (12-7, 1-4 
SEC) 94-69 in Memorial Gymnasium.
Parsons’ missed free throw in the 
final seconds UF’s game against South 
Carolina on Wednesday cost his team a win.
Sunday, he led the Gators to their 
biggest victory of the season.
“When you have the rhythm going, 
and a little momentum is going your 
way, it’s pretty easy,” Parsons said. “It 
feels good to come into a hostile envi-ronment on the road and come away with one in a must-win situation.” 
When the Gators returned home from 
Columbia, S.C., a little after 2:30 a.m. Thursday morning, most of Parsons’ teammates went to bed.
He spent the night in the UF practice 
facility trying to shoot away the memo-ry of his mistake.“He went from a kid on Wednesday 
in the locker room crying his eyes out to 
the best game of his career,” UF coach 
Billy Donovan said. “I tried to explain to him, that’s how fragile all this stuff is. In one game you can go from the low-
est point of your basketball career to an 
extremely high moment.”
UF went 1 for 3 from 3-point range in 
the second half against South Carolina. Parsons opened the game against 
Vanderbilt by making five in a row.
“I think Chandler has a great op-
portunity to grow from this,” Donovan 
said. “You talk about the emotional roll-
er coaster that he’s been through from 
Wednesday to Sunday. It’s a lot. We’ll see how he handles this.”
Parsons, who seemingly couldn’t 
miss Sunday, has struggled to shoot the 
ball all season.
Coming into the game, he was shoot-
ing just 27 percent from 3-point range.
“(Chandler) is one of the best shoot-
ers in the country. He’s just been in 
a slump,” sophomore guard Nick Calathes said. 
“I told him he’s thinking about it too 
much, and to just shoot the ball the way 
he has been and they would fall.” 
The Gators broke the UF record 
for threes in a half when Calathes (15 
points) hit the Gators’ 12th of the game 
with the buzzer sounding just before 
halftime.

year’s 61-58 loss to the Commodores in Nashville. This time around, the Gators Parsons lights up Vandy

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The 
last time the Gators took the 
court, they lost courtesy of 
South Carolina’s late-game 
theatrics. Saturday, UF put on a show of its own.
The Gators lit up the score-
board in the first half, hitting a school-record 12 3-pointers, five of which came from for -ward Chandler Parsons, who finished with a career-high 27 points in UF’s 94-69 win against Vanderbilt.
“ W h e n 
we’re hitting 
like that, it’ll 
be tough to beat us,” guard Nick 
C a l a t h e s 
said.
Parsons 
and guard Erving Walker re-
bounded from the loss to the 
Gamecocks by scoring 15 each 
in the first half. Parsons start-ed out a perfect 5 for 5 before shooting his only miss of the game, a deep 3-pointer, with 2:44 remaining in the first half.
“It was just one of those 
days, man,” Walker said. “Our shots were falling, and 
Chandler was hot.”
Two other Gators — 
Calathes (10) and Walter Hodge 
(10) — scored in double figures before the break as well.
Calathes, who had three 
first-half turnovers within the span of one minute, said UF’s main focus entering the game 
was not to let the emotional loss Gators dominate behind arc

At first glance, UF’s recruiting 
class is a bit puzzling.
Coming off two national titles in 
three seasons, with one of the sport’s 
hottest coaches in Urban Meyer, big-
time media attention and a super -
star quarterback in Tim Tebow, the 
Gators would figure to smash their opponents on the recruiting trail.
Instead, UF has the country’s 
ninth-ranked recruiting class ac-cording to Rivals.com and the No. 12 group on Scout.com — one spot 
behind Stanford. That’s a peculiar drop after the Gators hadn’t finished 
out of the top three 
classes on Rivals.com since 2005.
But the Gators’ 
lower ranking is more of a quality-over-quantity issue than a dip in the team’s ability to attract top talent.
