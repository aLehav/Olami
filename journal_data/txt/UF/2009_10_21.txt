Lawrence said she could have ever af-

Lawrence and her neighbor Shen-
ley Neely, who both live in northeast
Gainesville, used to own cheap lawn-
mowers that broke down often, so they
pooled their money to buy a better one
than either could have afforded alone.
"We would have never individually
bought that quality of a mower. I'm on a
tight budget," Lawrence said.
Alex Goldman, a UF graduate stu-
dent pursuing a doctorate in sociology,launched a Web site to help people share
called Sharability.org.
The site offers everything from cloth-
ing and accessories to electronics, sports
gear and tools.
Goldman said the goal of the Web
site is to bring people
together to share their
belongings with each
other rather than buy-
ing new ones and cre-
ating waste.
"There's a funda-

many people have and
that is the accumulation of rarely used

0 SUSPECT'S BOND SET AT $60,000.

At about 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Pablo Bur-
gos heard a gunshot.
"About two minutes later I heard a guy
screaming," he said. "He knocked at the
door, and he said, 'Please help me. Please
help me. I'm shot."'
The man was Glenn Altman, 27, of 1410
NW 55th Terrace, who had been shot in theBurgos said he refused to open the door
because he feared for his daughter's safety,
but she called the police while Altman ran
to another house.
The cops arrived a few minutes later
and were searching for Altman when the
Alachua County Sheriff's Office received
a phone call from a hospital, which ASO
would not name, saying a man with a gun-
shot wound to the face had driven himself
there.
Deputies traced blood back to Altman's
house, which was unlocked, to search for"We definitely believe it was
drug related."

other victims. Instead, they found a small
marijuana growing operation.
"We definitely believe it was drug re-
lated," ASO spokesman Art Forgey said.
"Whether it was a robbery gone bad or a
disagreement over price, we don't have the
specifics."Information from Altman led police to
the house of Nelda McNeill, 6416 NW 27th
Terrace, where an Alachua County Sher-
iff's SWAT team questioned people.
At about 4:30 p.m., officers arrested Ste-
phen K. McNeill, 20, and charged him with
burglary and attempted murder. McNeill's
bond is set at $60,000.
Burgos, Altman's neighbor, was sur-
prised but not worried by the shooting. Af-
ter the blood was cleaned from his porch,
he said, "This is a nice neighborhood."

the Hub Monday.
A man and woman paid for

vouchers similar to those given

The pair went to Einstein just

Quiznos about an hour later,
Holcomb said.
They gave the names "Gio"
and "Valesca" to employees
at Einstein, he said, though its
not clear if those are their real
names.
And because the vouchers
are worth $8.25 a piece, the res-
taurants paid the difference in
cash to the alleged food thieves,
he said.
A total of three meal vouch-
ers were used.

SANTA FE COLLEGE
Three banned from campus
for trying to take prank pics
Three Santa Fe College stu-
dents with a boat and a blow-up
doll were banned from campus
over the weekend when they
tried to shoot some prank pic-
tures on Lake Alice.
The students also had candles,
a lighter and beef kidneys inside
the boat, according to police.
When first approached by po-
lice in front of KinderCare near
Corry Village, the students said
they were headed for the river.
With the boat sitting on the
ground in front of them, police
told the students there were no
rivers in walking distance.
The students then told police
they were headed for the Santa
Fe River but later admitted they
planned to take prank pictures
on Lake Alice, according to a
University Police Department
report.
They were then banned from
campus and told they would be
arrested if they came back, so
they loaded the boat back into
their pickup truck and left.

Students may pay
for Reitz repairs
H IT MAY COST $42.5M.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Reitz Union needs reno-
vations, and students may have
to foot the bill.
Reitz Union Executive Direc-
tor Eddie Daniels gave a presen-
tation at Tuesday night's Student
Senate meeting about repairs
and construction costs for the
Reitz Union. Daniels said the re-
pairs would rid the Reitz Union
Hotel of asbestos and replace the
plumbing waste lines and the
building's lighting system. The
project would cost about $42.5
million over 15 years.
He said the money the union
generates from sales and stu-
dents' Activity & Service Fees,
which are collected through tu-
ition, wouldn't cover the costs.
Daniels said he plans to ask
other areas of the university for
money and mentioned possibly
implementing a student fee to
help cover the costs.
"We need money from some-
where rather soon," he said. "I'm
going to be making this presen-
tation every opportunity I get."
After Daniels' presentation,
senators passed a bill increasing
the administrative fee SG paysto UF from $150,000 to $300,000.
The fee helps cover universi-
ty services including the Univer-
sity Police Department, finance
and accounting and UF Human
Resource Services.
Earlier in the meeting former
Progress Party Sen. Dave Sch-
neider introduced Oscar Otzoy,
a member of the Coalition of
Immokalee Workers.
Otzoy described the poor
conditions and enslavement to-
mato pick-
Student ers face inGovernment Immokalee,
Fla.
"And as farm workers we are
united today, and we are strug-
gling to make sure these types
of abuses no longer happen," he
said.
He urged senators to push
Aramark to pay one more cent
for every pound of tomatoes it
purchases, which would boost
the wages of Immokalee work-
ers about 60 to 70 percent.
Otzoy's speech received a
standing ovation.
The initial resolution sup-
porting Immokalee workers was
voted down in September, but
Schneider said it will be reintro-
duced at next week's meeting.
A resolution is a piece of leg-
islation that supports an opinion
but takes no action.

Libraries offer online alternative to books, movies
By ANNA QUINTANA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Chip Halvorsen remembers
when borrowing an audio book
from the library consisted of 16 cas-
sette tapes.
Now books, DVDs and audio
books are available online, and pub-
lic libraries all over the country are
transferring part of their collections
from the shelves to the computer.
"It's pretty easy," said Halvors-
en, who works in the eBranch De-
parment at the downtown Alachua
County Library. "You just down-
load the software and choose from
a selection that is constantly grow-
ing."
With e-books, libraries are trying
to reach out to people who usuallywon't visit the library and can bor-
row a book from home.
"It's a natural extension," said
Daniel Barden, technical services ad-
ministrator for the Alachua County
Library District.
"Technology is moving that way.
It makes sense to offer material on-
line," he said.
However, downloadable media
only makes up a small percentage of
the total circulation in the district.
The Alachua County Library
District reached 3 million books in
total circulation for the last fiscal
year, and digital books only account
for about 10,000.
Digital books are borrowed just
like print books -there are set num-
bers of digital copies, and people are
put on wait lists if all the copies are"checked out."
"We have to protect copyright,"
Barden said. "Publishers want
to make as much money as pos-
sible, which limits the availability
of certain materials, especially new
books."
"Public libraries are the
great equalizer. It's hard to
beat the book."
Daniel Barden
county library employee
However, classics that are con-
stantly on reading lists are always
available.
One of the library's downloading
systems, OverDrive, is compatible
with the Sony Reader to downloadbooks.
"I just bought the Sony Reader,"
Halvorsen said. "It is so thin and
light, and I can have five books with-
out the extra baggage."
A library card or e-card is all
that's necessary to check out or re-
serve e-books online.
"Dan Brown's new book is avail-
able right now through e-books,"
Halvorsen said. "It's a long kept se-
cret."
However, the library system is
not compatible with the Kindle, the
digital reader developed by Ama-
zon.com.
"The Kindle is not library friend-
ly," Barden said. "If Amazon opens
up the Kindle, their profits would go
down and that is something they do
not want."Many UF students also use on-
line book services to get digital cop-
ies of their textbooks.
Alisha Wainwright, a UF senior,
uses digital textbooks due to the eco-
nomic advantage and accessiblity.
"I do get headaches," Wain-
wright said, "but I don't have to
carry heavy textbooks and can read
it wherever there is wireless."
With the increasing use of e-
books, some are worried about the
demise of books and public librar-
ies.
"I think it will just lead to a hy-
brid of formats," Barden said. "We
are still a couple of generations until
that 'Star Trek' environment."
"Public libraries are the great
equalizer," he said. "It's hard to beat
the book."
More mosquitoes, warmth bring West Nile to area
0 VIRUS TRANSMITTED BY
MOSQUITOES, NOT PEOPLE.
Mother Nature threw another curveball at
the human anatomy -elevated traces of the
West Nile virus and Eastern equine encephali-
tis have seeped into Alachua County.
The viruses, which are transmitted by mos-
quito bites, have been detected by numerous
sources, said Paul Myers, the assistant directorof the Alachua County Health Department.
Indicators of the viruses' presence include
chickens' blood samples that show traces,
observations made by local veterinarians on
horses and light traps bated with carbon diox-
ide that take mosquito counts.
Symptoms for diseases may include head-
ache, fever, fatigue, weakness, dizziness and
confusion. Myers said the viruses can only be
transmitted from mosquito to person and not
person to person.Myers said that elevated trend, which was
noticed in late September and early October,
is a seasonal result of Florida's humid climate
mixed with rain showers. He believes once
the weather begins to cool, the
Local viruses will subside but neverNews go away.
For now, Myers advises resi-
dents to cover up if they go out before dawn
and after dusk and to avoid places where there
are prevalent levels of stagnant water. Accord-ing to Myers, one tablespoon of stagnant wa-
ter is enough to attract 200 mosquitoes.
Although residents should be concerned
about the viruses, Myers assures that it is far
from reaching a pandemic level.
"This is definitely not something that
should cause people to panic," he said, noting
that more people die from lightning strikes in
Florida than mosquito bites. "This is some-
thing that can be easily contained."

Keep Tradition
City should serve liquor
during pivotal matchupGuzzling Gators and boozing Bulldogs will have to
find new ways to get wasted at this year's UF-Geor-
gia football game.
There will be fewer places to buy alcohol and more po-
lice patrolling the Jacksonville Landing during the iconic
sporting event.
We have mixed feelings about this new policy. Increas-
ing the police presence for the game is a great idea. The
event has a nasty history of violence and has seen a handful
of student deaths in the past few years.
It makes sense for the city of Jacksonville to take mea-
sures to improve safety for all in attendance, and upping the
number of police by 25 percent is certainly a good start.
UF and Jacksonville will also increase the number of
Sideline Student Safety Zones, which provide first aid, wa-
ter, transportation and other services to students on Game
Day.
However, we aren't quite so thrilled about the new alco-
hol policies that will be put in place this year.
The Landing will cut the number of alcohol vendors in
half, and so-called "roaming shot" vendors will be banned
entirely.
Excuse us, but isn't the event known as "The World's
Largest Cocktail Party"? Oh, wait.
We don't believe the free flow of alcohol should be re-
stricted for this event or any other. And especially not in
Jacksonville.
Have you ever been to the Landing? Snooze.
Officials claim that reducing the number of alcohol ven-
dors will help to improve traffic flow in the area. But the
shortage of alcohol could actually make those areas much
more congested.
It seems to us that people will find other ways of get-
ting alcohol. They may simply move to the parking lot to
drink.
Fans who suddenly face stricter rules on booze will just
get drunk beforehand. Wouldn't it be much safer for people
to get wasted in areas with increased police presence -such
as, say, the Landing?
The UF-Georgia football game is by far the most impor-
tant sporting event in Jacksonville this side of the Super
Bowl. And it happens every year.
Restricting access to alcohol at the Landing will push
people away from the area's bars and reduce the city's eco-
nomic benefit.
The event is clearly very important to the city of Jack-
sonville. It's so important that city officials agreed to sub-
sidize Georgia's travel expenses when the schools renewed
their contract to continue playing the game in Jacksonville
Municipal Stadium earlier this year, according to Alligator
archives. The Bulldogs will have three chartered planes to
fly them directly into Jacksonville, all on the city's dime.
City officials also agreed to drop the stadium rent to a
ridiculous $1 when the new contract was negotiated, ac-
cording to The Florida Times-Union. They're obviously
expecting some huge payoffs from the influx of economic
activity.
The UF-Georgia game has a long-standing history of
drunken revelry and obnoxious fandom. We believe that
UF and the city of Jacksonville shouldn't fix what isn't bro-
ken and leave this Southern tradition alone.

Loss of control can create obsession
our years ago this week, my mom sent me a Hal-loween care package. It included Halloween deco-
rations, a haunted house soundtrack for our dorm
party and a tin of cookies.
I ate a few cookies for lunch. My roommate came back
from class and noticed, after a while, that I hadn't gone to the
dining hall for dinner.
"I hope you're going to eat something besides cookies,"
she said.
I said I was just leaving. So I took a walk around campus,
calculating how long it would take for me to go to the dining
hall and back.
While I circled the Reitz, angry at my roommate who
made me do this, it finally hit me: I had a problem.
It might have become more clear to me if I had been stick-
ing my finger down my throat in the bathroom. But I was just
"eating healthy" and going to the gym.
Plus, smart girls didn't get eating disorders, I told my-
self. Those problems belonged to the bimbos barfing in the
bathroom or skipping meals, I thought. I also was sure these
people somehow made a conscious decision to enter the eat-
ing-disorder cult.
I've since learned that eating disorders are about control,
and it's often well-educated perfectionists who succumb.
Many never seek treatment or come to terms with their is-
sues.
For me, extreme dieting started in high school to correct
the one thing I thought was wrong with me: my weight. Ev-
erything else was already strenuously controlled. I got per-

Then college came and threw everything out of whack. I
got B's. I didn't know anyone. I wasn't sure about my major.
Suddenly, my eating patterns were all I had to hold onto.
Part of me is reluctant to write this column. I worry it will
be oversharing, or people won't think I had a "real" eating
disorder.But that thinking is part of the stig-
ma of eating disorders I want to dis-
pel. There is no shame in having an
eating disorder, and eating disorders
encompass more types of behavior
than starving or meal-purging at such

When I was restricting my eating
and exercising for hours every day, I
didn't reach a scary weight. My ribs weren't fully visible; I
didn't have to shop in the children's section. The mind games
I played were a different story. Every minute was consumed
with thinking about what I would eat next. And whenever I
failed, the feelings of worthlessness were overwhelming.
At UF, or any other top-tier university, we like to think
our knowledge makes us immune. If we know the warning
signs for something like an eating disorder, there's no way
we can be vulnerable.
Unfortunately, this isn't only my experience. Since I start-
ed college, I've seen other people go through the same issues
with eating.
College triggers control freaks, who are often the most suc-
cessful people here. It's a high-pressure environment where
it's impossible to be the best at everything. When people are
determined to maintain control in uncontrollable situations,
they often choose unhealthy solutions.
As midterms come to an end, think about how you're
trying to control your life. If you have a problem, seek help
-college makes things seem out of control, but it's also a
great transitionary period to ensure self-destructive behav-
iors don't ruin the rest of your life.
I told myself I was too smart to have an eating disorder.
Being an overachiever only made me more susceptible.

Letters to the Editor
Time allotted in Growl uneven
I know Darts & Laurels doesn't come out
until Friday, but I'd just like to give a spot-
on-nail-on-the-head-explanation laurel to
Delta Upsilon President Matthew Panzano.
I wholeheartedly agree with all of Pan-
zano's arguments about why the student
sketch segment of Gator Growl was entirely
dedicated to Greek inside jokes. If you take
a look at how Gator Growl is set up, it just
makes sense to have the event represent
the Student Body based on a proportion of
demographic to time. O.A.R., for example,
played an hour-long set, so clearly 33 per-
cent of the Student Body are members or
former members of O.A.R. Only then would
O.A.R.'s current music resonate with their
audience. Jabbawockeez was, again, tailored
to another demographic of the student com-
munity. The dance routine lasted about 15
minutes, so that means it was catered to the
roughly 8 to 9 percent of students who are in
hip-hop dance crews. Sorry Jabbawockeez
lovers, if you want a longer routine, you're
gonna have to do some more recruiting.
To be honest, the Greek community de-
served an even larger time slot not because
of its demographic size but because of its
ability to reach all members of the Student
Body, something that O.A.R. and Jabbawoc-
keez could only do for about 42 percent of
the people in attendance. I mean if every-
one laughed at "trannies," imagine the sort
of entertainment from an hourlong Greek
routine.
It goes without saying that the "Greek
time slot" was probably the best of the en-
tire show. Not only did the Greeks use their
allotted time to entertain the whole stadi-
um, but they are perhaps the only group at
Gator Growl to live up to "an event that is
supposed to inspire and entertain all mem-
bers of the Gator Nation."

UF handled bomb scare poorly
Yesterday I got a text from my brother
saying, "Stay away from the Reitz Union
today. There's a bomb threat there, and the
bomb squad was deployed."I make a daily stop at the Reitz to get a
delicious sandwich at Orange & Brew, so I
was legitimately frightened. I immediately
checked ufl.edu, my e-mail, e-Learning and
even the Reitz Union Web site, and there
was not a single mention of a disturbance.
Perhaps I'm overreacting, but I could have
been walking directly toward a bomb.
Would it have been hard for UF to say, "The
Reitz Union parking garage will be closed
until further notice"? I don't know the po-
lice department's policy, but I don't think
deploying the bomb squad happens when
there is not "a credible threat." So I ask what
it would require for a text alert to be sent
out because apparently the destruction of
a building doesn't qualify as a threat to the
entire campus.
Even if you don't send out a text, it is
still irresponsible that the university made
no attempt to inform its students. Perhaps
an e-mail: For your safety, the Reitz Union
parking garage will be closed until further
notice. Or do e-mails also only get sent out
when the entire campus is threatened? Be-
cause the University Police Department
sent out an e-mail about the "mobile mas-
turbator"; apparently indecent exposure is a
greater threat than a bomb. You may think I
am overreacting, but my faith in UF keeping
me safe has been thoroughly shaken.

Government should require health care
In response to the letters today regard-
ing health care, I think it is unfortunate that
some think this way. What about children
-do they not have a "right" to health care?
They can't go out and get a job, and often
their parents won't spend money on some-
thing that is not mandatory. They would
rather go to the emergency room uninsured,
and guess who pays the bill for them? We
do with our hard-earned taxpayer dollars.
It would be more expensive to continue
the way we are going. If health care is not
made more affordable or even mandatory,
then people will just opt not to have it. We
mandate that drivers must have an auto in-
surance. How do you feel when you get hitby an uninsured driver? It makes me angry.
Well that must be how doctors and hospi-
tals feel dealing with the uninsured. People
will spend a small fortune on cigarettes or
alcohol before they would ever buy health
insurance for them or their kids.
Oh and what about the people who want
insurance but just can't afford it? They need
an affordable alternative. Trust me, the in-
surance companies are even worse than the
government because they charge so much
for premiums and take billion-dollar bo-
nuses while the taxpayers pay the cost of
the uninsured. They are looking out for our
interests less than the government. I agree
with a government health care plan that
will compete with private insurers and get
as many people insured as possible for a
more affordable cost.
David Silba
Gainesville resident
People entitled to health care
Government's raison d'&tre is to be of the
people, by the people and for the people.
This is a core tenet of our republic. When
the people wanted safe food to eat, the gov-
ernment provided it through the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture.
Then the people wanted a safe workplace,
and the government gave them one through
the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration. Now the people want health, so it
is time for the government to give it to them
through a public option.
Health insurance companies as they ex-
ist now are merchants of death beholden to
the interests of Wall Street, and you can be
certain Wall Street is not interested in your
health or well-being. What it is interested
in are profits, and the way health insurance
companies make those profits is to deny
you as much care as possible. For every dol-
lar Americans pay in premiums, as much as
20 cents goes to operating costs and profit.
Compare this to Medicare, which spends
about 3 cents of every dollar on operating
costs with nothing taken for profit. The pri-
vate insurance company is taking almost
seven times as much of your premium,
which could be going toward your healthcare payment. Anybody who opposes a
public option is either in the pocket of the
health insurance industry, or he or she feels
that killing his or her fellow Americans in
the name of Wall Street returns is as Ameri-
can as an apple pie. If you don't want blood
on your hands, call your representatives
and demand a public option.

Current health system worth fixing
I would like to respond to the opinions in
the Alligator that show a bias against health
reform. And ignoring the likely possibility
that these gentlemen watch Fox News, I'm
going to try to debate with them rationally.
First of all, studies show that 45,000 people
are dying otherwise avoidable deaths every
month based on the simple fact that they
don't have health insurance. If that isn't
worth fixing, I don't know what is.
Now that that is out of the way, I would
like to shoot down all of Daniel Morris' so-
called "solutions" to our health care prob-
lems. One: tort reform. As Morris so elo-
quently put it, the federal government has
limits on what it can and cannot do. Tort
reform can only be handled on the state
level because accident compensation varies
widely across jurisdictions.
Two: decoupling insurance from em-
ployment. This is also known as the Wyden-
Bennett bill, and it was shot down by both
Republicans and Democrats. Why didn't I
see your Alligator response when that was
being fought over?
Finally: allowing insurance companies to
travel across state lines. Dumb idea. Regula-
tions on insurance differ from state to state.
Open up state lines, and every insurance
company is going to move to the state with
the easiest regulations.
Sure our health insurance will be cheap-
er, but it will also be worthless because our
insurance will simply be able to deny us
coverage whenever it feels like it. Not ex-
actly reform I can believe in.

A Friend Dies. Who Cares?
Nm=r7ED WATCH BAND
Toxic drinking is an epidemic on campuses all across America.
It means consuming so much alcohol the drinker passes out. But while "sleeping it off," the victim may be quietly dying.
When you come right down to it, students themselves are the best ones to tackle this problem.
So, in growing numbers, Stony Brook students have joined together in the Red Watch Band movement.
Working with experts, they fine-tuned a course in techniques to handle these alcohol emergencies. Red Watch Band
members can act fast, when every second counts.They know the quick steps they can take to rescue a passed-out
student from a drinking death, and can immediately summon professional help. Everyone completing the course is
given the distinctive red watch for identification.
Since its inception at Stony Brook University in March 2009, approximately 40 schools STO N Y
across the country have signed on to implement this lifesaving program. BR\K

Nudge said the new measures
aren't necessarily being implemented
to reduce alcohol consumption but
to reduce foot traffic and keep the
crowd moving.
"We just wanted to promote a safe
atmosphere," Nudge said.
UF junior Hailey Zielinski said she
understands that people drink and
some rules are going to be broken,
but she hopes that students behave
responsibly this year.
On the night before last year's
game, Zielinski and four of her
friends were driving back from a
Halloween party when their car was
hit head-on by a drunken driver. One
of her friends was killed, and every-
one else was seriously injured.
"I'm really, really hoping that
everyone is safe this year," Zielinski
said.
According to Nudge, the vendors
at The Landing must take classesfrom the Division of Alcoholic Bever-
ages and Tobacco where they will be
trained to identify fake IDs and de-
termine when someone has had too
much to drink.
Nudge said division officers have
always been present at The Landing
during that weekend, but there will
be more of them this year.
"They will arrest you for under-
age drinking. They will ticket you,"
she said.
UF junior Jordan
State Ball, who will celebrate
News his 21st birthday that
weekend, said the in-
creased security and fewer vendors
may take away from the fun of the
event.
"It certainly makes it more dif-
ficult for me to do what I wanted to
do," he said.
Nudge said everyone will still be
able to have a good time, just in a
safer environment.

Jeff Ferrell is a professor of sociology at
Texas Christian University and a visiting pro-

has been a clear resurgence of sharing since
the economy has gone bad," he said in a tele-
phone interview.
He said there are many varieties of shar-
ing networks cropping up all over the U.S.
and other countries as well.
"I've seen it in London, I think it's happen-
ing in a lot of places," he said.
People have started to use the Web site,
but Goldman said there is a long way to go

He said that people who don't share
as much as they borrow will be flagged as
"moochers."
According to Goldman, even though he
hasn't researched the legalities of it, his Web
site might even provide some legal protec-
tion for people who loan items, in that there
would be an electronic record of the loan.

Along with Terron Sanders, Jaye Howard
and Brandon Antwine, Hunter has worked his
way into the rotation at defensive tackle.
Against Arkansas last Saturday, Howard
was also held out with an injury, forcing Hunter
to play the majority of the snaps alongside Sand-
ers.
"It was great to be around those guys, play-
ing with the defense and being part of (the)
team," Hunter said.
Meyer and McCarney heaped praise onto
Hunter for getting himself in good enough
shape to play for the entire game, something he
never would have been able to do a season ago.
In addition to cutting weight, Hunter has
gained a reputation as one of the most coachable
players on the team, earning him the respect of
his teammates.
"There's not a play where he doesn't ask for
somebody's help," Sanders said. "He comes to
me and asks about a play, or he goes to coach
Mac, or he goes to Lawrence Marsh. He's try-
ing to learn as opposed to people hoping that
it comes to them. He's out there wanting to get
better."Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF defensive tackle Terron Sanders has also played a key role
in the Gators' rotation.

(9.7 per game) and made (6.8).
Carmel Bouchman, one of Tish-
man's teammates on Israel's under-18
national team, is going through the
same process after signing on to play
at Temple this summer.
"A lot of times, they're around pro-
fessional teams or around club teams
or around national teams, so there's a
series of checklists the NCAA has togo through to make sure he's clear
and he's eligible," Donovan said.
"We're just waiting for the NCAA to
finish up their due
diligence on what
they've got to do toMen's declare him eligible
to play."Basketball When Tishman
is cleared to play,
he will help shore up the Gators'
depth at point guard.
His court vision and ability to dis-tribute the ball have drawn compari-
sons to former Florida ballhandler
Nick Calathes.
"He's got the real Euro game. He'll
get in the lane and make one of those
real fancy passes like Nick used to
make," forward Chandler Parsons
said. "I'd say he's real crafty and just
a great passer.
"He can chip in, for sure. I feel like
he's a good player. He's smart. He's a
pass-first guy. The guys love to play
with him."

PUSH (MATCHBOX TWENTY): Since taking over at South
Carolina in 2005, Steve Spurrier has averaged 7 wins a
season. Is this the year the Gamecocks finally get over
the hump?
ARE YOU GONNA GO MY WAY (LENNY KRAVITZ): Vander-
bilt is 2-5, and another bowl appearance would go a
long way in recruiting. But with games against Florida,
South Carolina, Georgia Tech and Tennessee still to
play, it doesn't look good for the Commodores.
ONE (U2): Alabama jumped Florida and landed at No.
1 in the AP poll on Sunday. Are the Crimson Tide the
nation's best team?
GIVE IT AWAY (RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS): Ole Miss quar-
terback Jevan Snead was being talked about as a Heis-
man Trophy candidate before the season started. But
through six games, Snead has thrown 9 picks.
BETTER MAN (PEARL JAM): No one expected much from
first-year Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen. But the
Bulldogs already have wins against Jackson State, Van-
derbilt and Middle Tennessee and nearly upset LSU. If
Mullen can pull off another win or two, he'll have MSU
fans forgetting all about Sylvester Croom.
YOU G ET WHAT YOU GIVE (N EW RADICALS): Auburn coach
Gene Chizik gave Gus Malzahn the keys to the Auburn
offense, and the Tigers haven't looked back. Auburn
won its first five games, the same number of games
Chizik won in two seasons as coach at Iowa State. The
Tigers now boast the nation's eighth-best offense (464.9
yards per game).
DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER (OASIS): Everybody's has
pretty much written off LSU after its loss to Florida. But
the Tigers still control their own destiny in the West. If
they win out, they will play in the SEC Championship
Game.
FLY (SUGAR RAY): Arkansas quarterback Ryan Mallett
has proven to be the perfect fit for coach Bobby Petri-
no's offense. Mallett has let the ball fly this year, lead-
ing all SEC quarterbacks with 1,646 passing yards, 14
touchdowns and only three interceptions.

0 HE IS IN BETTER SHAPE THIS YEAR
AFTER LOSING 35 POUNDS.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmastri@alligator org
For Florida's Omar Hunter, less is more.
The redshirt freshman is coming off his
most productive game as a Gator, logging six
tackles including two for a loss.
The difference for the 295-pound defensive
tackle? The weight he isn't carrying.
"He put himself in a position, because he
worked so hard in the offseason, to get in
shape for probably the first time in his life,"
defensive line coach Dan McCarney said."He's in really good shape now. He was in ri-
diculous shape last year at this time."
Hunter came to UF with enough hype to
merit coach Urban Meyer calling the nose
tackle the Tim Tebow of his recruiting class.
Unlike Tebow, Hunter didn't experience
success right away.
He battled through ankle and elbow inju-
ries for much of the early part of the season,
and ultimately, it was a bulging disk in his
back that put him on the shelf for the year.
"I came (to Florida) in decent shape and
then when I got hurt I got in really bad shape
because I wasn't able to run or anything,"
Hunter said.
He ballooned to 330 pounds and had to
work hard with strength and conditioning

f there's one thing I've learned,
it's that 90's rock music holds the
answers to virtually all of life's
most important questions.
So let's take a look at how things
in the Southeastern Conference are
shaping up at the midway point in
the season:
SEMI-CHARMED LIFE (THIRD EYE
BLIND): Florida may be No. 1 in the
first BCS Poll, but there are plenty of
question marks staring at the Gators
after narrowly escaping against Ar-
kansas on Saturday.
With linebacker Brandon Spikes
sidelined with a groin injury at the
moment and limited options in the
passing game, the road to Pasadena
is looking a little bumpier than ev-
eryone thought.
HEY JEALOUSY (GIN BLOSSOMS): You
may hate him. You may love him. But
Tennessee coach Lane Kiffin is going
to be hanging around for a while.
Kiffin agreed to a new contract Tues-day that will
pay the coach
$14.25 million
over the next
six seasons.

Tishman still not cleared
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

It didn't take Billy Donovan long to
change his opinion of Nimrod Tishman.
After setting relatively low expectations
for Tishman at the team's media day last
Thursday, Donovan said the freshman was
a pleasant surprise through the team's first
weekend of practice.
"When a guy comes in from overseas
where the game and the pace is a little bit
different -it's a faster pace here -and
they have a hard time adjusting," Donovan
said Monday. "But he's been pretty good.
I think he feels comfortable with the game
going up and down the floor."
Donovan's initial evaluation of Tish-
man was that he would not be a "major
contributor" this year, but rather someone
who could fill in for a few minutes to give
guards Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton
some rest. Based on Donovan's comments
Monday, it seems as if the 6-foot-5 guard
might play a bigger role if needed.
"I was really worried about stamina with
him coming overseas, the pace of practice,"
Donovan said. "He's done a pretty goodjob. He's a really good passer."
Tishman still has not been cleared to
play for the Gators, but he has been practic-
ing with the team. Donovan said there have
been no signs Tishman won't be ruled eli-
gible, and the NCAA Clearinghouse should
complete the process by Florida's first game
of the season.
The NCAA has to make sure Tishman
has adhered to its amateurism rules and
is eligible to compete at
the college level, which
Donovan said is made
more complicated by the
fact that there is no direct
parallel to college basket-
ball in Europe. This leads
many European players
Tishman to play for club teams, as
Tishman did with Mac-
cabi Tel Aviv, and their national teams.
Tishman led Israel with 18.3 points, 2.3
assists and 2.3 steals per game in the Euro-
pean Under-18 Championships this sum-
mer. He also showed an impressive ability
to get in the lane and draw fouls, leading the
entire tournament in free throws attempted
