  Don’t relocate. Communicate. 
  That’s the slogan about 100 UF students 
chanted as they marched from the steps of Fine Arts Building A to Tigert Hall to show their support for the Architecture & Fine 
Arts Library, which may be converted to stu-
dio space for ﬁ  ne arts students. 
  Students carried signs with “cooperate,” 
“communicate,” “collaborate” and “save the AFA library” printed in capital block letters.
  The rally culminated on the steps of Ti-
gert Hall, where Adam Mahardy, 22, a senior architecture student who organized the pro-active rally, handed UF Provost Joe Glover a 
petition with 60 pages of signatures in sup-
port of the library. 
  Glover did not address the students.
  The College of Fine Arts needs more stu-dio space for its students to maintain its ac-
creditation, and a proposed solution is mov-
ing the collections from their current location 
to Library West. 
Lucinda Lavelli, dean of the College of 
Fine Arts, said she wants to put students’ minds to rest about the issue.
  “The libraries are absolutely not closing,” 
she said. “We are simply addressing space is-sues. They would never close without a lot 
of talking.”
  Rumors of proposed closures of the li-
brary began to swirl at the beginning of the semester after Glover suggested the Archi-tecture & Fine Arts Library and the Music 
Library transfer some of their collections to 
Library West to create more space for class-
rooms, studios and practice rooms. 
  The Architecture & Fine Arts Library 
serves an estimated 85,000 people annually.
  Lavelli said Christopher Silver, dean 
of the College of Design, Construction 
and Planning, has volunteered his col-
lege to analyze the libraries and devel-op plans to optimize their use of space.
Some portions of the libraries’ collec-
tions may still be moved to Library West in order to make room for needed cre-
ative and classroom spaces, she said.
There has not been a ﬁ  nal decision about the libraries’ fate. 
  The colleges are scheduling meet-
ings later in the month to try to lay out speciﬁ  c goals as well as a timeline.

  The Court also lifted the

during the elections to invalidate 
the results and order a re-vote.Mason and Welsh, in particular, 
voiced fears that a re-vote might

Students browsing booths at the Arts and 
Cultural Opportunities Fair last week looked 
on in surprise as 70 students began dancing 
and Gator-chomping in unison.
The students were performing a choreo-
graphed dance to Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome 
to the Jungle,” laughing and jumping about on the Reitz Union Colonnade.
Josh Sallerson, a 22-year-old dance se-
nior, said the dancers were trying to be as inconspicuous as possible before the perfor -
mance, talking with people at the fair and casually looking at the booths.
“We burst into dance, and I had no clue what to expect,” Sallerson said. “Then you see people start to accumulate and pull out 
their cameras and video recorders, and you 
realize you’re part of something that’s unex-
pected and big.”
As of Monday evening, the YouTube vid-
eo of the dancers had more than 2,700 hits. 
The flash mob, organized by the School 
of Theater and Dance, is just one of two that 
have taken place on campus in the past few weeks.
Flash mobs occur whenever any large 
group of people performs the same action.
Flash mobs aren’t just becoming common 
at UF. According to The New York Times, they have been popping up across college campuses nationwide. They have been used 
to welcome new students during orientation and to celebrate upcoming programs and 
anniversaries. 
Flash mobs have become more popular 
recently because they are a new way to raise 
awareness about causes, said Conroe Brooks, 
the co-founder of Flash Mob America.
“People get addicted to them,” said 
Brooks, whose group can be hired to help organize flash mobs.
The two other recent flash mobs at UF 
were held to celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the 
Jewish New Year, and to kick off National Arts and Humanities Month. 
Jeffrey Kaplan, program director at UF 
Hillel, organized the three-day flash mob for Rosh Hashanah. About 40 people gath-
ered to blow the shofar, a large, traditional 
horn used to signal the new year. Students 
showed up, blew their shofars, screamed 
“Happy New Year!” and left.
“The first day I got there 20 minutes early 
and waited for people I recognized,” Kaplan 
said. “At 12:38, people started showing up.”
Brooks said YouTube has helped spur 
the growth of flash mobs because the web-site provides people with an easy way to get their videos seen.
“College kids want to do crazy stuff,” 
Brooks said, “so why not do a flash mob?”Flash mobs gain popularity across campus, nationwide

After months of planning, 12 start-up compa-
nies and service providers moved into the Inno-
vation Hub on Monday. 
The move comes after UF’s Office of Technol-
ogy Licensing, which was the first office to move into the building, moved there on Friday.
The move went off without a hitch, and the of-
fice has settled in and is functioning in its new home, said Jane Muir, associate director of the Of-fice of Technology Licensing.  
“As one of my staff said, ‘I’ve been a part of 
many moves, and I’ve never been a part of one 
that went so smoothly,’” Muir said.
The office moved to the first floor of the In-
novation Hub, where Muir said all full-time staff and some part-time staff will begin working im-
mediately. 
Muir said some companies will set up shop 
right away, and others will be coming and going. 
About 35 people are now working in the build-
ing.
Start-up companies in the business incuba-
tor pay an all-inclusive rental rate that includes 
furnished office space, maintenance, utilities and 
property tax. 
In addition to the start-up companies the In-
novation Hub was built to nurture, the building will host law firms, accounting firms and product 
design firms as part of the business incubator’s 
ecosystem, Muir said.
Service providers offer a certain number of 
hours each month to the start-ups to help with 
growth and development.  
Overall, Muir said Innovation Hub tenants are 
going to appreciate the new space.
“I think everyone who comes into the building 
is very excited about being here,” Muir said.Twelve more companies move 
into UF’s Innovation Hub “We burst into dance, and I had 
no clue what to expect.”

Editor’s note: The names of the victim 
and her boyfriend have been changed to protect their identities.
Christine, a petite 20-year-old, slips her white karate jacket over her loose pink tank top. She ties her hair that frizzes 
in the summer into a ponytail, slips her red-painted toes into plastic flip-flops and ties her orange belt around her waist.
She walks down a hallway that smells of 
dust and ammonia — her shoes going clop, clop, clop — and joins her karate group. She bows to her instructor. Her groomed eye-brows narrow as her brow furrows in con-centration. She knows what to do. She’s been doing this for two years.
The way she barks back instructions 
makes her sound like anything other than a woman who is recovering from rape. 
Six months ago, a man forced himself into 
her apartment and onto her. Since then, she’s managed to keep her life together — she stayed in college, didn’t get depressed and kept a strong relationship with her long-time 
boyfriend — but small reminders haunt her.
Christine’s story is not a new one in the 
Gainesville area.
Gainesville Police reported 60 cases of 
sexual battery so far this year, including 
Christine’s attack. In 2010, there were 77.
The University Police Department report-
ed 11 cases of forcible sex offenses — a clas-sification that includes rape — in 2010, ac-cording to the department’s safety report for 2011. Three of those were on campus. Eight of them were off campus. The 2011 statistics were not reported. 
Christine tightens her belt.Here, she feels normal. She isn’t a victim 
anymore. She tries not to let the memory re-surface. 
But when she dodges through a migrat-
ing herd of UF students on the way to class, she looks from male face to male face for a flicker of recognition. The memory hits enough of a nerve to make her lose her ap-petite when she sees red sneakers like the ones her attacker wore. She grips her purse tighter now. She hasn’t walked across cam-pus alone at night yet.
“It’s always going to be something that 
happened to me,” Christine said. “I don’t feel much like a victim, I guess.”
Here come pushups, leg lifts, squats, 
crunches. Repeat.
She practices her waist-high kicks and 
chest-level punches, just like she had for more than a year before the attack.
She walks from karate with her friends or 
her boyfriend, Jim, back to her place with its modest laptop-sized television, floral bed-spread and cluttered desk. 
She flips through her language book, 
eventually setting it next to her boyfriend’s dried, folded T-shirts — he can’t do laundry to save his life. She slings her backpack on and marches to her next lecture, blending into the hive of busy students. 
Her boyfriend has stepped up to the role 
of protector since the incident. He walks with her whenever he can, after karate practice, classes and dinner. He’s the type of guy who likes to spend hours tinkering with cars, but he’ll put that off until she’s safe at home. 
Jim doesn’t want her to leave his side if 
he can help it. It’s not that he’s obsessive. It’s 
just, Christine said, he can’t bear to let any-
thing happen to her again. The way he looks 
at her, with careful concern, gives it away.
Christine and Jim met in a beginner math 
class two years ago. She got there early and claimed her seat — not too close to the front but not all the way in the back. Then she sat and listened to the hum of the auditorium, expecting the day to be relatively quiet.
Five minutes before class, the back door 
slammed open and a frazzled underclass-man sprinted toward the front of the room. He jerked his head left to right, looking for a place to sit. Scrambling toward the back of the room, he sat in the seat next to Christine. He was gasping in deep breaths, and beads of sweat were sliding down his forehead.
“Is this seat taken?” Jim wheezed.She laughed. Looking back on it, Chris-
tine said she can’t remember who gave the other his or her number, but she doesn’t care. Before a week had passed, they were dating. 
He was the first one she ran to after she 
was raped.
It was almost the end of the Spring se-
mester. Christine said she’d spent the night watching mind-numbing movies to relax: “Twilight” and “New Moon.” 
Around 4 a.m., she went to bed and curled 
up with a worn toy tiger Jim had given her.
A knock shook her from her half-asleep 
state around 4:30 a.m. Jim had forgotten to show up the night before to pick up sun-screen. Christine thought it was him, so she stumbled out of bed and called his cellphone. No answer. 
She walked across her empty, third-floor 
studio apartment and opened the door.
A roughly 5-foot-10-inch man shoved her 
through the door frame and rushed inside, 
slamming the door behind him. He held a 
silver, four-inch blade.
When Christine saw the knife, she said, 
she knew it was over. She’s barely 5 feet tall. 
It was an unfair fight.
“Every time someone tries to fight back, 
they end up dying,” she said as she told the 
story. “Skin and knives, it just doesn’t work. … Had it been a fair fight — Yeah, I would’ve 
decked him in the face.”
He ordered her to take her clothes off.
“Are you serious?” she said to the man, 
according to the police report.
He swung the knife side to side.
He raped her twice.
Other details in the police report are too 
graphic to print.
At some point, her Samsung cellphone 
rang and rang. It was Jim. 
The man grabbed her phone and texted, 
“My phone is acting up.” Christine is a crea-
ture of habit, and this wasn’t her usual re-sponse to her finicky phone. Jim started to 
worry.
The attacker ordered her to take a show-
er. When she went back into the main room, 
he was leaving. Just like that.
“Close the door after me,” Christine re-
called him saying.
And he was gone.
Christine scrambled to put on her Victo-
ria’s Secret pajamas and ran to her car.
She drove the few blocks to Jim’s dorm 
and, since her phone had been stolen, 
screamed at his window until he rushed out-
side.
She broke down in his arms. 
She cried for a few days after that, but 
she hasn’t cried much since. She said she doesn’t see the point in it. She said she isn’t 
depressed or furious anymore. 
She just wants to let it go. 
No, they haven’t caught him. Yes, there 
could be a court case one day. Sure, she may have to see his face and tell this story to the 
jury, the judge and the lawyers.
“It would just be a madhouse. It’d just be terrible,” she said. “I don’t want to have to 
look at his mother.”
As strange as it is, Christine admitted, 
the rape actually made her relationship with 
Jim stronger. She said she supposes it was a 
make-it-or-break-it situation. 
Since the attack, she said, Jim has made it 
clear he wants a future with her. He’s helped 
her keep her life together, even though there seems to be roadblocks around every turn. 
Christine’s dad canceled her lease at her 
Southwest Second Avenue apartment near campus.
GPD officers initially acted like they sus-
pected Jim, which Christine said made her furious. 
She said GPD officers kept pestering her, 
asking her if she was sure her attacker was African-American and not another minor -
ity. Police still have a swab of Jim’s saliva for possible evidence.
“It just seemed like they didn’t want to 
find anyone,” she said. “They just wanted to close it as soon as possible. I think that some-body, somewhere probably knows who this guy is. … I wish they would focus on this a little more. Because the next [victim], she’s not going to get away.”
Cpl. Tscharna Senn of the Gainesville Po-
lice Department said forensic evidence usu-ally solves cases that have run cold.
“It is a horrible crime,” Senn said. “If it 
happens, we are 100 percent committed to finding the person who did it.”
Christine’s academic adviser was one of 
the most understanding people about the in-cident, Christine said. She told her adviser what classes she wanted, and it was taken care of.
Jim has been there through it all, but 
he doesn’t like talking about the incident, at least not with anyone except his closest friends. 
After it happened, Christine said, a sense 
of guilt clawed at him because he wasn’t there to protect her. So they drove to South Florida to enjoy a weekend with Jim’s family and cook dinner together. 
It’s the little things like that, she said, and 
the big things like Jim’s love that got her through the rough times. She said she can carry herself the rest of the way.
“If I keep letting it bother me, it’s going 
to drive me insane,” she said. “It happened, and it sucks a lot, but I can’t change it.”

survivoreas,” she said. “Students and 
faculty will definitely be in-
volved in any decisions.”
If the university goes 
through with the proposed relocation, it is unlikely that 
all of the books will fit in Li-brary West. Some volumes 
would be archived off cam-
pus, Mahardy said. 
It takes 24 hours to access 
archived books. 
“The library is crucial to 
serendipitous browsing,” 
said Cynthia Peterson, the 
architecture archives curator in the department of special 
collections and area studies in  Smathers Library. 
On Wednesday, Mahardy 
will meet with Glover to ex-
press his desire for an alter -
native solution. If Glover pro-
ceeds with the plan to close 
the library, Mahardy will or -
ganize another rally.  
Questions about the effi-
ciency of space usage within the college have prompted 
additional discussions geared 
toward modernizing the en-tire college, Lavelli said.
“This little question about 
library use has prompted so many larger questions,” she 
said. “Things like, ‘What does 
the future hold?’ and ‘What can we do better?’”
procedures.
“This wasn’t enough,” Mason 
said during deliberations. 
The fall SG Senate elections pro-
cedures came into question when the Students Party filed complaints that the results were flawed because 
some students may have voted in 
the wrong district.
Fall elections are based on loca-
tion, determined by ZIP code or residence hall.
Students who only had their 
permanent addresses filed with the 
registrar, not their Gainesville ad-
dresses, would have been placed in District E. District E is for commuter 
students and includes all ZIP codes 
except those specified in Districts A through D.
Early in the afternoon of the first 
day of voting, Sept. 27, the voting screen for District E was changed 
so that students were required to fill 
out an address affidavit before vot-
ing.
Prior to this change, the pre-vot-
ing screen listed the voter’s district and presented the option to either 
vote in that district or fill out an af-fidavit to change addresses.
In the 2010 fall elections, 65 stu-
dents voted in District E. That num-ber jumped to 535 students for the 2011 fall elections.
Ossip used those numbers in his argument for an elections redo. Os-sip said he wanted to disregard the 
“blame game” and focus instead on students’ right to fair elections and 
on the voting numbers.
“The numbers simply do not lie 
about what the average voter expe-rienced,” he said.
Ossip and Leytham plan to ap-
peal the decision to the administra-tion, Leytham said.
“I think that the court’s decision 
was shameful,” she said. “And I think that it was purely political.”
At the hearing, members of the 
Election Commission presented the investigation report that the Supreme 
Court ordered them to prepare. The 
petitioners and respondents, as well as the justices, were able to question 
the present commissioners.
After the petitioners and respon-
dents made their closing arguments, the justices questioned them and de-

A white, 5-foot-5-inch orb-like 
structure sits out of place among 
the scales, measurement tools, shelving units, computers and common office materials in Room 227 of UF’s Food Science and Hu-man Nutrition building. 
Although it looks like some -
thing from a sci-fi movie, the in-strument, called the Bod Pod, mea-sures body composition through air displacement, said Karla Shel-nutt, a human nutrition assistant 
professor. 
Although there are other Bod 
Pods on campus, Shelnutt said, 
researchers currently are using the instrument in the nutrition build-
ing for two studies regarding body 
fat. 
This Bod Pod cost about $45,000 
and was funded through research 
money and grants, Shelnutt said.  
The first study considers body 
mass index, or BMI, while the sec-ond looks at a new measure, body adiposity index, or BAI. BAI is considered more accurate 
than BMI, according to a recent ar -
ticle in the journal Obesity.
Shelnutt’s two-part study will 
look to see if the measurement is accurate for college students.
The BAI and the BMI measure-
ments will be compared against those of the Bod Pod, which cur -
rently is the “gold standard” of body fat measurement, Shelnutt said.
BMI doesn’t work for lean ath-
letes and people with high muscle mass, said 23-year-old Blake Bar -tholomew, a nutrition master’s student who has been working on the study. 
“Tim Tebow’s BMI was [30],” 
Bartholomew said. “If you look at that on the BMI scale it would say that he is obese, which he clearly is not.”
Having excess body fat increas-
es the risk for diabetes, heart dis-ease and other conditions, Shelnutt said.
She said the goal of the study is 
not about weight loss.
“It’s about healthy lifestyles, 
eating better food and being more physically active so students can be healthier and live a longer and 
better life,” Shelnutt said.The study is open to all stu-
dents, Shelnutt said.
Participants will receive a print-
out of their body composition on 
the spot, Shelnutt said.
Bartholomew was curious to use 
the instrument not only because of 
its accuracy but also because he thought it looked interesting.
He compared the inside of the 
Bod Pod to the inside of an egg but with a window.
“It looks like a spaceship and an 
egg mixed together,” he said. “It’s 
odd looking.”

Bod Pod and participation in the 
studies, email ufbmistudy@gmail.

UF astronomers have uncovered new details about 
the formation of the Milky Way galaxy with the help of 
the world’s largest telescope.
Third-year astronomy graduate student Jesus Marti-
nez and chairman of the department of astronomy Ra-
fael Guzman led the team in the Canary Islands, Spain. 
There, they used the Gran Telescopio Canarias, the world’s largest telescope, to discover that galaxies like the Milky Way are not as large as astronomers originally thought.
UF owns 5 percent of the $180 million telescope, 
which was first used in July 2009.
Until now, astronomers had believed galaxies were 
more dense and compact but had transformed into a 
large, scattered mass at some point in time. However, 
astronomers had no explanation for the theory.
Martinez, Guzman and their team discovered why. 
The UF researchers found that four of the dense galaxies were six times less massive than previously thought.
“We used a different technique that was much more accurate,” Martinez said.
The team used a method called spectroscopy to break 
the light gathered by the telescope into separate compo-nents, Martinez said. 
“When you break light, you study features that are 
revealed in a much more accurate way,” Martinez said.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias can gather more light 
than other telescopes, and the more light gathered, the farther the dis-tance into the universe astronomers can see. 
The use of spectroscopy allowed 
the team to view the characteristics of 
the galaxies differently than previous 
astronomers.
“The big impact is that we’re go-
ing to trust less of the previous tech-
niques,” Martinez said. “People will be more careful.”
This latest discovery will not change the face of as-
tronomy or affect the average person’s view of the uni-
verse, Martinez said. 
“It just helps the global picture of galaxy evolution,” 
he said.Galaxy not as large as originally thought

Don’t judge protesters 
by same picket sign
This weekend, an Occupy Wall Street protester was cap-
tured in a photograph defecating on a police car in New York City. 
For those who want to immediately categorize the Occupy 
Wall Street movement as disrespectful or uncivil, please wait 
before you make such sweeping assumptions. 
Some have called the “Occupy” movement a left-wing re-
sponse to the tea party. 
The current level of civic engagement on both sides of the 
ideological spectrum is encouraging, but the actions of a few 
outliers have been used to categorize the attitudes, thoughts and feelings of each movement. 
For some, the tea party is just a bunch of racist, old, white 
Christian Southerners who want to shoot guns and read the 
Bible all day. 
Morgan Freeman and Samuel L. Jackson recently criticized 
members of the tea party movement as being racist against 
President Barack Obama. 
Many have used pictures of signs comparing Obama to a 
primate or the misspelling of the N-word to illustrate the rac-ist tendencies of members of the movement. 
But can we really come to acceptable conclusions about a 
movement based on a minority of its members? 
Every movement, whether it’s on the left or on the right, 
has its outliers. 
Earlier this year, a video surfaced of a protest in California 
of the infamous Koch brothers, entrepreneurs and philanthro-pists who donate to conservative interest groups. A couple of the protesters were caught on tape calling for the hanging of (African-American) Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for his involvement with Koch-sponsored organizations. 
Were these individuals representative of everyone at this 
protest? Absolutely not. It would be intellectually dishonest to make that claim. 
Of course, there will probably be many who criticize this 
editorial by saying that one side is really more racist or crazy than the other. 
But in the end, if we truly look at the majority of people in 
these political movements, we will find that they are normal. 
They are people in your classes, your neighbors and pos-
sibly even your close friends. Chances are they don’t have 
malicious or violent motives. 
It seems that both groups can simply be categorized as  
frustrated. Their frustration may be directed at the govern-
ment or corporations or both. They also might have different goals or outcomes they would like to see from policy-mak-ers.
However, speculating that the motives of the members of 
these movements are based in racism, Marxism or any other “-ism” out there is foolish and childish. 
We can all debate possible solutions, but let’s be grown-
ups about it.  
You can certainly disagree because debate is healthy; just 
be decent.Fun and focus is better than worrying
It’s super easy to get caught up in the mood of a situa-
tion. I don’t know about you guys, but I can tend to be melodramatic sometimes. 
Don’t worry, I’m not outspoken about it. I keep my oc-
casional dreary mentality and thoughts inside.
When did we all get so jaded and cautious? Was it after 
our first missed assignment? Was it after our Internet con-nection died right as we needed to submit a paper online? Could it have been after someone made fun of us in el-ementary school?
No, I’m actually asking you. Because I definitely don’t 
have an answer. I just know we all tend to be a little moody sometimes and get in our heads about things.
As the late Dr. Jack Shephard once said, “We have to 
go back.”
So yeah, let’s go back to the mentality we had as chil-
dren. That mentality seems to be really carefree and unas-suming — two traits I wish I could exemplify more.
Please don’t read this column as a whiny-boo-hoo 
piece. Believe me, I’m not complaining about life, not even about my life in particular. I’ve just been noticing a trend lately in myself and some of my friends — we’ve had to be “grown-ups” or “adults,” whatever those are. 
Being an adult doesn’t mean you have to be mad and 
sad all of the time. Yes, now we have bigger problems to deal with, but that doesn’t mean we have to let them affect us negatively.
Recently, I was able to perform an improvisational 
comedy show, also known as “improv,” for a group of middle schoolers. After our brief show, we ran a workshop for them.
All we did was a few warmups and played a few games 
with them, but it was enough to remind me of what it was like to learn something for the first time.
Trust me: Learning improv can be a scary and terrify-
ing thing — if you let the mood affect you.
I started learning improv with Theatre Strike Force three years ago during my fresh-man year. I joined without even really knowing what improv was and certainly not what it can be-come. I’ve learned that improv is all about trust. You have to trust your capabilities as well as those of your partners.
The best moments in improv 
— and also in life — are when 
you clear your mind and just simply react to the world around you. 
The kids didn’t give a crap about what they looked like 
on stage, something I know my improv colleagues often do. They knew they were not going to be improv experts, but they didn’t care. They just wanted to get out there and have a fun experience.
It’s important to keep trying new things with your 
whole heart. Commit to the situation, and trust your in-stincts. 
Wouldn’t life be so much more enjoyable if we worried 
more about those things instead of how dumb we look?
I know we all have deep situations to deal with. I know 
we’re all entitled to countless feelings and emotions. 
As UF enters midterm exam season, where academic 
stresses can shove themselves into other facets of our lives, let’s try to face the world with a smile instead of a frown.
We need to be like those pretty cool middle schoolers! 
Just try your hardest to do your best, and everything will fall into place. That sounds like a much better plan than worrying all the time about everything, right?
So thank you, Hoggetowne Middle School. You have a 
really cool outlook on life — teachers  and students alike.
I’ll try to bring more positivity into my routine, too. A 
balance of fun and focus sounds pretty ideal to me.

Fox News commentator and former Gov. Sarah Palin an-
nounced Thursday in a statement she would not be run-ning for the Republican nomination in 2012.
Her supporters were not thrilled. After months of tireless 
organizing, fighting back on Palin’s behalf and hoping against 
hope that all the signs pointing against a run were false, her 
supporters experienced a painful blow. The candidate whom they sincerely believed was the GOP’s best hope in 2012 let them down.
Palin claimed it was her dedication to her family that pre-
vented her from mounting a run, an argument that is difficult to make, seeing as America already knows all there is to know about them. All the attacks that could have been slung their way, unfortunately, have been. Ever since she entered the na-
tional stage in 2008, she and her family’s personal lives have 
been a target. None of that will disappear now that she has decided not to run. Gossip about her will be clumped with information about soap operas, former child stars and miracle medicines, and her life will continue to be a source of interest for those who find her views and lack of a record amusing.
And that is precisely why she should have run. Running 
would have given her a chance to set the record straight, to impress in debates and make serious statements on policy. 
She could have given America another opportunity to see 
her as something other than an SNL caricature of question-able intelligence. I am not saying she could have won. But she could have restored her image. That isn’t exactly what one would call a “legitimate” reason to run for the highest office in 
the nation, but Sarah Palin and legitimacy are less than syn-onyms.
But she chose not to run. Perhaps she prefers the easier 
path — playing rabble-rouser for the right rather than holding serious jobs with serious responsibilities. Even her excuse for stepping down as governor in 2009 seems far weaker now — she is simply reinforcing what her opponents said all along. Is it, as Jon Stewart has mentioned, that she simply does not appreciate that being “president,” like being “governor,” is 
more than a title, but an actual job?
If elected, would she have been willing to serve?
In 2008, Palin was handed a microphone and called up on 
stage. America since turned that microphone off, but Palin hadn’t been willing to leave. She kept voicing her concerns on national issues, acting as a sort of pseudo-spokesperson for the right even when much of the right no longer took her seriously. But now, she has money. She can build herself her own stage, possibly covered with a grizzly-bear pelt, a giant 
American flag backdrop and a cubic zirconium-encrusted po-
dium right in the center, a megaphone placed neatly on top.She can do what she loves — being “unshackled” and say-
ing what she wants — without worrying about “consequenc-es.” If she isn’t worried about her national image, she can con-tinue to cater to a small fan club that will continue to write her checks. Her career as a commentator is alive and well. But her 
political career — and though I would ordinarily be wary of 
such statements, I make one now — is over. The also-ran-for-second-place from What’s-it’s-name, Alaska, couldn’t possi-bly mount a presidential run in 2016 or later. She could poten-tially run for lower office at some point, build a resume and get back in the game, but her reluctance to do any sort of real government work over the last three years indicates she has no plans to do so. Had she run in 2012, she would have had some sort of national political resume to speak of down the 
line. Not anymore. She’ll keep ghostwriting more and more 
books that will sell fewer and fewer copies. Her contingent of die-hard fans, which already took a major hit today, will shrink. The country will remember little more about her than that she was, for McCain, The Great Mistake of 2008.
And now, though she has loitered around the corner of the 
national stage for some time, the cue has come for her to exit — naturally, to the right.

In the modern world, it seems absurd that 
you could be put to death for your faith, right? Such a barbaric practice took place in 
the Middle Ages, but surely not now. 
Yet, that is exactly what is happening right 
now in Rasht, Iran. A 34-year-old Christian pastor by the name of Yousef Nadarkhani may be facing death by hanging if he does not re-nounce his faith.
He was arrested in October 2009 while reg-
istering his church in an attempt to offer an alternative to the Islamic educative monopoly present in Iran. Nadarkhani wanted the op-tion to have his two boys educated without 
the state’s mandatory instruction in Islam. For 
challenging the government’s absolute con-trol, Nadarkhani was imprisoned.
More recently, in September 2010, Na-
darkhani’s original charge of protesting was changed to those of evangelization of Muslims and also apostasy , a turning from the faith. Both are crimes punishable by death in Iran if so decreed by a religious fatwa. While fatwas, unlike the constitution of Iran, are not binding, the courts may draw on them when making a decision, as they did in Nadarkhani’s case. 
The claim of apostasy arose because of 
Nadarkhani’s Muslim parentage and his later 
conversion to Christianity at the age of 19. The 
11th branch of Iran’s Gilan Provincial Court states that because of his Muslim parentage, he was a member of the Islamic faith before he turned to Christianity and is accordingly guilty of the crime of apostasy.
Last week, the court gave Nadarkhani a 
chance to renounce his faith in Jesus Christ, and in doing so, spare his own life. Nadark-
hani refused. He was offered two subsequent 
chances later in the week, on Sept. 27 and 28. On both occasions, he remained unyielding. The severity and 
blatant injustice of the case has stirred the global community to come out in force, de-
manding Nadarkhani’s unconditional release.
The White House issued a message as well, 
calling on Iran to “demonstrate a commitment to basic, universal human rights, including freedom of religion.”
But not everyone has the luxury to live un-
der the mantle of liberty. Around the world are people who are denied what most would view as universal rights. Such suppression of 
freedom is abhorrent. The faces of those who 
seek to abolish liberty are many and various, but each should be met with the same outrage, resolve and determination to set things right. 
The global outcry that has begun to sway 
the Iranian judges in the case of Nadarkhani came from ordinary people, who saw such blatant injustice and immediately rebelled against it.
Now, you can fold this paper up and never 
think another thought about it. But if this story 
captures your attention as it did mine, then I 
encourage you to find a way to get involved in the movement against this infringement upon human freedom. 
Just spread the word, and let people know 
what is going on right now in Iran. Publicity through any medium can send a powerful message. If you are ready, if you feel the same sense of obligation that I do to help protect the 
basic rights enjoyed by millions around the 
world, and if you are finished reading, then you can hand this paper to the person sitting next to you.

PRESUMED DROWNED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MARATHON — Four hours into a family fishing trip, 
rough waves flipped a 22-foot boat off the Florida Keys, 
tossing eight people overboard. Seven of them, including 
a 4-year-old girl, survived by clinging to their capsized 
vessel and a small blue cooler for almost 20 hours, suffer -ing exhaustion, jellyfish stings and hypothermia.
A 79-year-old woman, the matriarch of the group, was 
missing and presumed drowned.
“When the will to live kicks in, human beings can do 
amazing things,” Coast Guard Petty Officer Nick Ameen said. 
Those rescued were taken to a hospital with non-life-
threatening injuries.
The family left Layton in the Middle Keys around 8 
a.m. Saturday to fish in less-than-ideal conditions. It was raining, seas topped 7 feet and winds were whipping up to 38 mph. After they anchored 3.5 miles off the island chain, two waves hit suddenly, capsizing the vessel.
The women grabbed the girl and the 2.5-foot cooler. 
One of the men tried to rescue his mother, but she slipped through his grasp and disappeared into the water.
Almost immediately, the two groups — the three wom-
en and girl and three men — drifted apart.
Nearly a day later, they were rescued when a com-
mercial fisherman spotted the men Sunday morning and 
alerted the Coast Guard, which found the women and the 
blue cooler several miles away in the warm waters.
The women said the boat turned over so quickly that 
there wasn’t time to grab life jackets for anyone except 
the child, said Kendra Graves, a seaman with the Coast 
Guard.
Florida law requires children 6 or under on a boat 26 
feet or less to wear a life jacket if the boat is moving. If 
the craft is anchored or docked, they don’t have to wear a life vest.
As the weather improved Sunday, fishing boat captain 
David Jensen headed out with customers to catch live bait. Off in the distance, he saw a large object floating in the water.
As he turned the boat to get closer look, he saw a man 
waving. At first, he said, he thought there was only one 
person holding on to the sunken boat, its bow protruding 
just a few feet out of the water. When he got closer, he 
realized there were three men.
“I tried to get them to swim to the boat, but they said 
they didn’t know how to swim,” Jensen said. “Then I had the mate throw them life jackets. One guy put on the life 
jacket and swam to the boat. The other two guys wouldn’t 
get off the boat. ... They said they didn’t know how to 
swim.”
One of Jensen’s customers jumped in and swam over. 
He tied the boats together and helped the other two men, 
one at a time, back to Jensen’s boat.
“They were exhausted. One guy overnight had lost his 
mother,” Jensen said. “He was very visibly upset, which was a little tough because he was the one who spoke the 
best English.”
Zaida San Jurjo Gonzalez died. Her son, Jorge Alejo 
Gonzalez, survived along with his wife, Tomasa Torres, 
the elderly woman’s daughter, Elena G. Gonzalez, and 
her boyfriend, Juglar Riveras.8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2011

As public concern over 
fossil-fuel dependence in-
creases, many are turning to 
the sun.
UF’s American Solar Ener -
gy Society exists to promote 
the benefits of renewable so-
lar energy. The Gainesville 
Solar Tour is scheduled for Oct. 23 at 11 a.m. at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
Organizers aim to educate 
residents, business owners and students about the long-term advantages of solar en-ergy. 
The free event will allow 
participants to meet with professional contractors, Gainesville Regional Utlities and the local chapter of the 
U.S. Green Building Council to gather information about solar energy. 
Those who attend will 
also have the opportunity to 
tour the homes of local hom-
eowners who have installed 
solar panels. 
Anna Prizza, the director 
of UF’s Office of Sustainabil-
ity, will be the featured key-
note speaker. 
Alejandro Palomino, a 
fifth-year mechanical engi-neering student at UF, serves 
as the director of the Solar 
Tour.  “Gainesville has the most 
solar per capita in this state, which no one knows. This event shows why,” he said. “Our goal is to demonstrate 
to students and residents 
what Gainesville has to of-fer as far as solar energy and energy efficiency. This is the best event in the city for peo-
ple who are interested in in-
stalling a new system in their home.”
UF’s ASES chapter is the 
oldest and most recognized branch in the nation, Palo-mino said. 
“Students most often 
don’t have money for solar 
panels, but it’s a chance for 
students to learn something new,” he said.

Two Student Senate bills have re-
cently stalled due to lack of specifics.
Student Body Treasurer TJ Villamil 
vetoed the Senate-approved bill for six 
cellphone charging stations.
He said he thinks the stations are 
a good idea, but he wanted more spe-
cific information, including reassur -
ance that there would be six charging 
stations.
Villamil also wanted to make sure 
that the Senate would have to give its 
approval if the project costs at least 
10 percent more than the estimated 
$28,800 that will come from Student Government reserve funds.
The Senate can override Villamil’s 
veto if they pass the bill again by a two-thirds vote. 
Villamil said he hopes senators will make changes to the bill.
Dave Kratzer, associate vice presi-
dent for student affairs, sent back a bill taking $90,000 out of SG reserve funds to use for three upcoming events.
Kratzer wrote in an email that the 
bill simply needs to be in line-item form in order to conform to statutes.
In an email to 
senators, Villamil 
proposed breaking 
down the proposed 
transfer. 
Of that $90,000, 
$15,000 would to go 
to the Florida Inter -
national Step Show, 
$4,000 to Soulfest and $71,000 to Stu-

Florida freshman quarterback Jacoby Brissett started against LSU last week, completing 8 of 14 passes for a 
touchdown and two interceptions. Brissett will compete with fellow freshman Jeff Driskel this week in practice. 
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
Jacoby Brissett is still UF’s starter at quarterback, but Jeff 
Driskel will have an opportunity to capture the job this week. 
Driskel, a freshman, sat out Saturday’s game against LSU 
because of an ankle sprain he suffered the previous week 
against Alabama. 
That opened the door for Brissett, another freshman, to 
take the reins of the offense.
But coach Will Muschamp said Driskel is expected to prac-
tice this week barring an injury setback, and performance will determine who plays Saturday against Auburn. 
“We’ll work with Jacoby as being the starter at this point,” 
Muschamp said. “We’ll work through 
the week and progress to see who prac-
tices the best.”
Muschamp added a caveat: If 
Driskel’s injury limits the number of reps he can take in prac-
tice, Brissett will have a leg up in the competition. 
With John Brantley out again this week, the two normally 
would split the practice snaps evenly, but Driskel’s injury 
could change that. 
The majority of Florida’s game plan is set after Tuesday’s 
practice, allowing the team to focus on third down and the red zone on Wednesday. Thus, Driskel will need to practice from the get-go to have a shot at the opening. 
“As we move further in the week I’ll know more, obvious-
ly, of how much he’ll be able to go and compete for the job,” Brissett the starter 
for now, Driskel will practice, compete

� UF ALLOWED TWO 100-YARD 
RUSHERS IN LAST TWO WEEKS.
MATT WATTS
Alligator Staff Writer
Changes on defense are likely after 
the Gators have given up 464 rushing 
yards in back-to-back losses against Ala-bama and LSU. 
The stark regression from the begin-
ning of the season, when Florida was one of the best in the nation against the run statistically, can be attributed mainly to missed tackles, coach Will Muschamp said Monday.
The team has worked extensively on 
technique since fall camp, even doing live tackling drills during game weeks to ready the defense. Still, it remains an is-sue, and Muschamp said there could be changes coming.
“If you don’t want to stick your face 
on somebody, {we will] find somebody else,” Muschamp said.
While it has been an issue across the 
board, Muschamp pointed to the second-
ary as the weakest link. He said tackling 
has been “a big problem” for the unit, especially against dominant running teams like Alabama and LSU. 
“Have we worked on it? Yes. Have 
we worked on it enough? No, obviously not,” he said. “We’re going to look at some different guys to see if they’ll tack-le better.”
After the loss to LSU on Saturday , Defensive shakeup likely 
thanks to poor tackling This is when we learn the most about the 
Gators.
When they are in a downward spiral; 
when their backs are against the wall; when they have to deal with misfortune.
“When you face adversity, you find out a 
lot about where your leadership and where your football team is,” coach Will Muschamp said Monday.
Florida’s season has played out the way 
most people expected it to so far: a 4-0 start against inferior opponents, followed by losses against two of the best teams in the nation. 
But what happens next, and how Florida 
responds with games against No. 24 Auburn and division-rival Georgia, is when we learn what Florida is really made of, and who is go-ing to lead this team away from a repeat of 2010, when UF finished 8-5 after starting 4-0.
Muschamp said Monday that handling 
adversity boils down to mental toughness, something his team lacks right now, and it starts with him.
“At the end of 
the day, adversity causes two things,” Muschamp said. “It causes you to unify, it causes you to divide 
— one of the two.”
Down a starting quarterback, banged up 
and demoralized after two blowouts, this is the time when we find out if Florida is going to unify, or if players are going to do their own thing — something that was a problem Satur -
day against LSU.
Florida’s defense, which looked impenetra-
ble the first month of the season, has faltered. The secondary can’t make tackles, linebacker With their backs against the

Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
Florida coach Will Muschamp cited poor tackling as one of the main reasons the team struggled against the run in 
games against Alabama and LSU, when the defense allowed 464 rushing yards and two 100-yard rushers. Muschamp said changes in personnel could be on the horizon. 
Gators changing defensive mindset; Gillislee to see more touches
Muschamp said tackling is a matter of desire.
“You either want to do it or you don’t,” he said. “[We 
have to] find guys who want to tackle.”
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins was pulled against LSU and 
replaced with freshman Michael Taylor, and three safeties 
saw work opposite Matt Elam, including little-used red-
shirt freshman Josh Shaw. 
Changing scheme: Muschamp said the defense has 
been more successful when playing a one-gap technique, in which the defensive linemen attack the space between two offensive linemen, rather than the two-gap technique, where they must read the play and react to the blocking assignments. 
“That’s something we haven’t played as well and some-
thing we may look at not playing as much of,” Muschamp said of the two-gap schemes.
Gillislee to get more work: One of the few bright spots 
from Saturday’s loss was the play of running back Mike Gillislee, who rushed nine times for a team-high 56 yards. 
Muschamp said Monday that Gillislee would be in line 
for a larger role going forward. 
“He’s one of the guys we realized that recognized the 
way we needed to play with some toughness,” Muschamp 
said. “We need to get him some more touches.”
Fellow running back Chris Rainey said he’s excited to 
see Gillislee receive more playing time.
“He brings a lot to the table,” Rainey said. “I love when 
he runs the ball. He’s probably going to be playing a lot 
more now, so I can’t wait to see that.”
Injury update: After leaving the LSU game early due 
to undisclosed injuries, defensive end Ronald Powell and safety Josh Evans should be ready for Saturday’s game 
against No. 24 Auburn, Muschamp said. 
Running back Jeff Demps was also limited Saturday 
with an ankle injury, and quarterback Jeff Driskel (sprained 
ankle) was not in uniform. 
Cornerback Jeremy Brown (sprained knee) remains 
out.
Contact Matt Watts at mwatts@alligator.org.NoteBooK , from page 13Muschamp said. “That will determine 
the reps and obviously determine the starter.” 
Last week, redshirt senior running 
back Chris Rainey said he knew by Wednesday or Thursday that Brissett would start based on the number of 
snaps each quarterback took in prac-
tice.
“It looked like he was more ready,” 
Rainey said. “He was ready to step up.” 
Brissett completed 8 of 14 passes 
for 94 yards, a touchdown and two in-terceptions against LSU. His offensive repertoire consisted mostly of check-
downs and deep bombs in between 
being subbed out to let Rainey or Trey Burton take snaps in the Wildcat for -
mation. 
Still, Rainey said Brissett looked 
calm throughout the game, keeping his poise and looking for receivers downfield in the face of pressure from the nation’s No. 5 defense. 
If Brissett starts again this week-
end, Muschamp said the Gators would likely expand the offensive playbook to include more than it did against No. 1 LSU. 
“Certainly we’ve got to do some 
more, something else, offensively,” 
Muschamp said. “When you continue 
to do the same things you get the same results, so we need to change it.”
The majority of Brissett’s produc-
tion came from his 65-yard touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver An-dre Debose; a play where the defender stumbled and Debose came from out 
of bounds to make the catch. 
Still, Muschamp gave Brissett’s 
performance a strong review. 
“I thought he managed our offense 
really well, and what we asked him 
to do he did very well,” Muschamp said. “He’s a very composed young man. He’s very intelligent, athletic, 
he’s smart, he wants to — he works 
extremely hard since he’s been here as far as learning the offense and learn-ing what to do and how we want to 
do it and manage our football team. 
We’re pleased with his progress.”

ALEX PECKHAM
Alligator Writer
Florida’s goal is to win a national cham-
pionship. 
The team views every practice and every 
event along the way as preparation on the 
road to the NCAA Championship meet.
The All-Florida Invitational was a gruel-
ing event held over three days that includ-
ed, for each event, preliminary heats in the 
morning and a final swim in the evening to decide a winner.
“I’m really tired right now, but it’ll help 
us in the long run,” said freshman Matt El-
liott, who excelled in the format, notching 
three wins and one second-place result as an individual. 
“It helps show us the type of shape we 
need to be in later in the season.”
Last weekend’s meet in the O’Connell 
Center provided a unique opportunity for the Gators to prepare for the NCAA Cham-pionships in a more focused way. 
Although the meet was against compe-
tition that isn’t considered championship-caliber, the event’s format gave the Gators a taste of the grind they will face in March, as 
well as the urgency necessary in every race 
to succeed in February.
A maximum of three swimmers from 
each team could qualify for an event’s final heat, an aspect of the meet that made every 
race, even the preliminaries, carry a sense of 
urgency for competitors.
“We had a few places where we qualified 
our top six,” coach Gregg Troy said. “That puts a lot of pressure on our team to be very good in the morning. 
”[Instead of] spending all year badgering 
them about where we want to be at the end of the year and how tough it is to be good at the NCAA meet, we put them in a dynamic where they have to get up and go.”
Troy felt this was especially important 
for freshmen swimmers who are used to easier preliminary competition in high school meets. He was pleased with how 
those swimmers, competing in their first col-
legiate meet, responded to the challenge. 
“We had nine freshman guys stand 
up and swim extremely well,” Troy said. “We’ve still got some holes, but the future 
is bright.”Early event win helping to

Florida senior Kelly Murphy recorded 83 assists and 27 kills in the last four games while playing 
a hybrid setter/outside-hitter role for the No. 13 Gators.BRYAN HOLT
Alligator Writer
There is more to Kelly Murphy than 
offense.
Florida’s most heralded volleyball 
player is also its most versatile athlete. 
It’s the reason she has 26 career triple-
doubles, but it’s also the reason why 
her overall stats don’t always jump off the page.
“You understand that she gets only 
half the reps in setting or only half the numbers the hitters get hitting because of the way the offense is run,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “She understands that there’s a lot more asked of her.”
Wise calls Murphy the “busiest 
player in Division I women’s volley-ball,” and the title is well deserved. As something of a setter and right-side hitter hybrid, Murphy plays every rotation for the Gators and leads the team in assists and service aces. She’s also second on the squad in kills and 
digs.
“It’s almost like there’s not enough 
sets to go around,” Wise said. “We 
were not able to change the rules that Kelly could set herself and hit it.”
Florida’s last four games, all 
straight-set victories, have shown how much Murphy can open up the offense 
without ever scoring a point. 
During that span, Murphy has 83 
assists and 27 kills. Her unselfishness 
has opened things up for players like junior Betsy Smith, who has 23 kills in those four games while playing a much lighter set load than Murphy. Smith’s .418 hitting efficiency would rank first in the Southeastern Confer -ence if she were eligible — you must 
have three attacks per set to qualify; 
Smith has 2.6 attacks per set.  
“I just don’t know what it is,” Smith 
said. “I think it’s (that) we’re finally all clicking together on all cylinders — on offense, at least.”
Ferrell improving, dealing with 
injury: Florida is asking a lot more out 
of senior outside hitter Stephanie Fer -
rell than it has in the past, and the re-sults have been largely positive. 
In a new role that requires more 
defensive play and serve-receive abili-ties, Ferrell has shown bright spots, in-cluding a .375 hitting percentage and 11 kills in Sunday’s win against LSU.
“Her top end is in front of her,” 
Wise said. “She comes in every day 
early for extra reps.”
On Sunday, Florida experienced a 
brief scare when Ferrell rolled an ankle 
she had hurt 
in the past. Wise said Monday it 
was being evaluated, and she did not yet know the extent of the injury.
“I’ve had a lot of history with this 
ankle,” Ferrell said. “But it’s better. I’ll be fine.”
Back-row defense improves: Plac-
ing an emphasis on it last week, Flori-da’s backcourt had a 52-dig day against LSU. But Wise was more excited about a nearly complete performance.
“When you combine serving, block-
ing, transition digs — that’s how you keep teams from siding out,” she said. “That’s how you keep teams from scoring. … We did that at a very high level.”Murphy’s unselfishness opens up attack for No. 13 Florida
� THE CENTER BACK HAS PLAYED EVERY 
MINUTE IN THE LAST SIX GAMES.

Kat Williamson could use a breather.
In six straight matches, the Gators’ starting center 
back hasn’t so much as sniffed the sideline or seen the 
bench until the final whistle has been blown. She has 
played 547 consecutive minutes.
Ever since fellow redshirt junior Katie Kadera’s sea-
son-ending ACL injury on Sept. 30, this has been Wil-
liamson’s role. She is described as the team’s anchor on 
defense and the emotional leader of the Gators. Now, she is needed more than ever.
But with a three-game road trip on the horizon, and 
Williamson’s own history of injuries to worry about — 
she suffered an ACL tear as a freshman — UF coach 
Becky Burleigh is trying to lighten the workload for her All-America defender this week.
“We would love for her to get some rest because, 
obviously, that’s a demanding job,” Burleigh said. “But at the same time, she’s a tough person to take off the field, especially in tight games.”
Though it’s painful to play Williamson for anything 
less than a full 90 minutes, Burleigh is looking for one 
of the team’s non-starters to emerge as a reliable sub-
stitute.
At every other position group the No. 11 Gators 
(12-3, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) are one of the most 
bench-friendly teams in the league. 
“We’ve been working on it,” Burleigh said. “We’ve 
been playing some different people at different posi-
tions in practice, and we’re going to continue to do that this week, too.”
The Gators generally allow their two defenders on the flanks, Maggie Rodgers and Jazmyne Avant, to flow freely up the field as an offensive possession progresses. Rodgers was a forward her freshman year before switching positions this offseason.
“We need more depth in our entire back line,” Bur -
leigh said. “Even Jazmyne and Maggie playing as many minutes as they’re playing is a lot. Especially with the way we play our outside backs, that’s a big role.”
Before Kadera’s injury, her fourth ACL tear since 
high school and second at UF, the Gators enjoyed an ideal three-player rotation at center back, with fresh-
man Annie Bobbitt coming off the bench. 
“[Katie] hasn’t started most of her career; she [was] 
starting this year and has worked hard to get that 
done,” Burleigh said. “She’ll still be able to contribute 
to our team in different ways…but it’s really a tough 
injury for her and for our team.”
Burleigh said Kadera has taken on a mentoring role 
and is trying to help Bobbitt adjust to life as a full-time starter.
The first-year defender had a trying performance 
Friday against Auburn, with two turnovers deep in Florida’s defensive third. The Tigers were able to take a 1-0 lead in the 34th minute off an errant pass by Bobbitt 
that was intercepted by AU midfielder Katy Frierson
Two days later, though, Bobbitt rebounded nicely 
with 83 mistake-free minutes in Sunday’s match with 
Alabama, helping hold the Crimson Tide scoreless in the second half.

week, too.”

UF VolleyballJelani Jenkins was benched in favor 
of Michael Taylor in the second half against LSU, and opponents have ac-cumulated 464 yards and seven scores 
on the ground the last two weeks. 
The offense hasn’t done much bet-
ter. 
No receiver has more than 10 catch-
es on the season. The running game isn’t what it was through the first four 
games. The offensive line has been po-rous and overmatched, and the Gators’ 
quarterback situation has more twists 
than an M. Night Shyamalan film.
The Gators slipped out of the AP 
Top 25 this week, and the road ahead isn’t much easier, with Gus Malzahn’s 
offensive scheme and running back 
Michael Dyer at Auburn this weekend. 
Then running backs Isaiah Crowell of 
Georgia and South Carolina’s Marcus Lattimore are waiting on the horizon.
Unless Muschamp makes the prop-
er adjustments from a coaching stand-
point, and unless Florida finds players 
to step up and straighten things out on the field, the Gators will go winless in 
October and sit at 4-4 entering Novem-
ber.
“We have a lot of guys that want to 
be a leader, then the next day they want to step off the podium and let someone 
else do it,” Muschamp said. “That’s not 
part of the deal. When you want to be 
a leader, you step up and positively af-
fect everybody in the organization ev-ery day.”
So who is going to step up as a lead-
er when this team is in a free-fall?
Because, to borrow a phrase from 
LSU cornerback Tyrann “The Honey Badger” Mathieu, who called out full-
back Trey Burton on Twitter: Florida is 
soft as cotton right now.

Junior Allie Will has spent her last few months jumping 
back and forth between two worlds of tennis.
After a national championship season as the 2011 South-
eastern Conference Player of the Year capped in May, Will 
worked up to a summer on the pro circuit before making her 
way back to Gainesville for fall practice.
After Sunday’s performance, Will, No. 2 in the ITA indi-
vidual rankings, can add her first collegiate singles grand slam 
title to her list of recent accomplishments after winning the 
main singles draw of the Riviera/ITA All-American Champi-
onships in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
“It’s a mighty big event to win,” coach Roland Thornqvist 
said. “The best players in the country are all there, and it’s at 
a beautiful venue in Riviera Country Club, so it doesn’t really 
get much better than that. It just proves to you that you’ve got 
what it takes.”
Will defeated No. 11 Jacqueline Cako from Arizona State for 
the title in a 7-6 (4), 1-6, 6-3 victory to become the first Florida 
tennis player to win a national singles title since 2005.
Thornqvist said much of Will’s success came from combin-
ing her physical talent with a more composed mental game.
“I don’t think she’s ever put it all together over the course of 
four days before,” Thornqvist said. “The will is always there, 
no pun intended, and she’s always had a great desire. Sometimes that great desire 
has gotten in her own way . She wanted 
it too much. This week she was maybe a 
little more matter-of-fact about it.”
Will also finished her time across the country with a runner-
up finish in the tournament’s doubles draw with sophomore 
Sofie Oyen.
The pair dropped the doubles championship to Stanford’s 
No. 11 pairing of Mallory Burdette and Nicole Gibbs in a 6-2, 
7-6 finish, but the No. 4 pairing of Oyen and Will had not played together in a competitive match since the spring sea-son.
Also, Oyen’s doubles play was the first time she had served 
after suffering a front shoulder strain this summer and drop-ping her first singles match in the tournament.
“She’s got phenomenal hands, great touch and compact 
strokes, and she likes targets, so her game is perfectly suited 
for doubles,” Thornqvist said of Oyen. “The fact that she was 
able to just jump in right away with Allie was a little bit of a 
surprise to me. But they won the indoors last year, so I know that they have that kind of talent level to win these champion-ships.”Will claims grand slam title at ITA All-American
