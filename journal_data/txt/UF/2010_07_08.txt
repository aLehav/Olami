EDMOND, Okla.  — Police said a local pharmacist gained a 
measure of revenge against a serial burglar in a sweet fashion. 
Police said they responded to an alarm at the Clinic Pharmacy on Sunday morning and found a window broken and four pill bottles of hydrocodone were missing.
But they said the pharmacist told them that because of recent 
burglaries, he had filled the pill bottles with chocolate candy in-stead of the drug.
Police said they don’t have any suspects in the break-in.

� THE BAN LASTS 90 DAYS.

Underclassmen looking to get 
down and dirty after dark will find 
themselves turned away from some of Midtown’s most popular venues, thanks to the establishments’ repeat-
ed underage-drinking violations.
The Swamp Restaurant, 1642 
W University Ave., and neighbor-
ing 101 Cantina, 1632 W University Ave., have been ordered to deny en-trance to customers under the age of 21 from 9 p.m. until closing time for 90 days, according to attorney Eliza-beth Waratuke, who represented the 
city in court. The probation began 
July 1.
Rum Runners, 116 SE First St., 
is appealing similar orders, with a hearing set for July 22, she said. 
The Swamp and 101 Cantina 
settled their appeals out of court, avoiding harsher sanctions. 
Under a city ordinance that went into effect in April 2009, bars and restaurants that incur a certain 
number of infractions each business 
quarter are subject to the prohibi-tion. Venues with a capacity of less than 201 can have up to five offenses per quarter, while larger venues can have 10, Waratuke said. 
First-time offenders get 90 days, 
and subsequent infractions incur 
longer prohibition 
periods.
The ordinance 
has a history of controversy. Rob Zeller, owner of the popular Grog House, 1718 W University Ave., unsuccessfully 
sued the city after his venue was found in violation of the code. Zeller said the ordinance was unfair to bar owners who are fooled by fake IDs.
Now, UF students are getting 
together to oppose the prohibitions

UF students will be seeing more new 
buses on campus starting this fall. 
Gainesville Regional Transit System, 
or RTS, recently bought 11 used buses 
from Lynx in Orlando and an addition-
al 17 new buses from California, RTS 
spokesman Chip Skinner said.
The buses will be ready to ride by 
the beginning of fall, he said, and some 
of the used ones, which are undergoing strenuous tests, may hit the streets as soon as the Summer B semester 
A new bus costs around $400,000 
to $600,000, Skinner said. The 11 used buses cost about $230,000 all together, which helped cut costs.“All of the used buses together cost 
less than one new one,” Skinner said. “We took over the interest rate Lynx was paying and then paid a severely discounted price for them.”
As for the new buses, funding was 
provided by federal grants, according to Skinner. 
“Around 50 percent of RTS’ funding 
comes from a transporta-tion fee attached to each credit hour at UF,” he 
said. “The rest comes from 
a local gas tax, state grants and federal 
funding, which helped pay for the new buses.”
Carm Jeudy, a UF advertising junior, 
said she doesn’t mind that about half of RTS adds new busesWORLD CUP

Gainesville is catching World Cup fe-
ver.
When the Netherlands and Spain face 
off in the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final on 
Sunday, students will be able to watch the match either on or off campus.
The Reitz Union will host two view-
ing parties for the match, which kicks off at 2:30 p.m. One will be at the Orange and Brew, and the other showing will be at the second floor auditorium in the Re-
itz Union. 
The second floor will have free pop-
corn and soda.
Mark Theunissen, a 25-year-old 
from Leiden, Netherlands, has been in 
Gainesville all summer for a tax law pro-gram at UF. 
He has watched almost every Neth-erlands match at Mother’s Pub & Grill 
on University Avenue. Theunissen, who 
said he will wear a lion’s costume to support his team while watching the fi-nal match, plans to hang a Netherlands 
flag at the bar and watch the game with 
fellow Dutch fans.
According to Mother’s vice president, 
T.J. Goodman, World Cup followers have been blowing vuvuzelas throughout the games. On Sunday, he said, Mother’s is prepared to play the Spanish and Dutch national anthems.

ball game,” Goodman  said.Fans ready for Cup final

Hollywood Video is Netflix’s next victim in 
Gainesville.
The video store, 4220 NW 16th Blvd., will 
be closed by the end of this month, according 
to Griffin Peters, an employee of Hollywood 
Video for the past seven years.
“Basically, there’s just too much competi-
tion,” Peters said. “Netflix and all those com-
panies put a lot of pressure on us.”
Peters also blamed mismanagement at the 
store for money running out. 
Blockbuster’s Archer Road location closed 
June 12 because of increasing costs and declin-ing business, district manager Andy Cohen 
said. The other two stores under the same 
management, located on Northwest 23rd Avenue and Northwest 39th Avenue, are not slated to close. All three stores are franchise-owned, and unless Blockbuster Inc. steps in to reopen the Archer Road store, it will remain closed, Cohen said. All of its employees have been transferred to the other two locations.
“Archer Road is one of the busiest roads in 
Gainesville,” Cohen said. “The cost of being at that location was high, and the revenue just 
wasn’t enough.”
The closing of the Archer Road Blockbuster 
came as a big shock to Jennifer Miller, a junior 
at UF, who calls herself a longtime customer.
 “I thought business was going well,” she 
said. “Whenever I go, there seems to be a lot of other people.”
Miller said she found out the store was 
closing when she saw signs saying some mov-
ies could be purchased in a closeout sale.
Thomas Harris, 34, said he was upset about 
the store closing, but not surprised. 
“I know it’s a busy street,” he said. “But the 
economy isn’t great, and there’s ways to get 
movies online. I’m sure a lot of people aren’t renting as much.”
Miller said she thinks she might turn to the 
competition now that the Archer Road store is 
closed.
“I feel kind of bad,” she said. “But I mean, 
seriously, Redbox is right there at Wal-Mart. 
It’s easy and cheap, but I do like the selection better at Blockbuster.”
According to a press release and earnings 
report by Blockbuster, the corporation as a whole is not faring well. Around 500 stores na-tionwide are scheduled to close this year. With competition like Netflix and Redbox rising, it may get even worse for movie stores.
Cohen said that he was as disappointed 
by the store closing as everyone else, and he 
hoped customers show their understanding by staying loyal to the chain.
“To our customers, it happened kind of 
suddenly, and we apologize,” he said. “We, as 
a company, really hope they visit our other lo-cations. I know it’s an inconvenience, and we 
do want to say we’re sorry.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 8, 2010

Students on campus for summer 
are the first to benefit from UF’s new 
Counseling and Wellness Center’s services.Previously, there were two sepa-
rate centers—the Counseling Center, which was located in Peabody Hall,  and the Student Mental Health Cen-
ter, located in the infirmary—which 
confused students, said Sherry Ben-ton, the center’s director. Gatorwell Health Services is also housed in the center, which opened May 10.
By consolidating the centers, costs were cut by half a million dol-lars, but no one was fired, she said.
The Counseling and Wellness Center offers a myriad of free ser-vices for UF students including counseling and biofeedback, which uses a sensor for sweat production 
and pulse rate.
Benton said mental health is im-
portant for students’ academic suc-
cess. 
“The two most common prob-
lems with students are anxiety and depression,” she said. “It’s hard to be a student with memory loss and lack of concentration.”
In September, when all the ser-
vices are operational, Benton said she expects the center to hold a grand opening.
For more information about the 
center’s services, visit its new web-
site at counseling.ufl.edu/cwc/Health centers consolidate, become more accessible

Senators wanted to make sure they have 
a voice in Gainesville politics during Tues-
day night’s meeting.
Senators passed a resolution calling for 
Gainesville commissioners to reexamine 
city codes after Gainesville resident Bruce 
Baber’s dog-sitting business was shut down because it violated a Gainesville statute.
Baber, a Gainesville resident, had run 
his business out of his own home for almost four years. Recently, Baber was found to be in violation of the code that prohibits local business owners from conducting their busi-nesses in their backyards.
“I am extremely grateful to the Student 
Government of the University of Florida for considering making a resolution in support of me,” Baber wrote in a letter to the sena-tors.
The resolution passed unanimously.Senators also passed a resolution request-
ing that voters should determine whether the five Alachua County Commission seats 
should be broken up into five individual 
districts.
If the question is put on the ballot in the next general election, residents will decide 
whether they want to break up the county 
into five commission districts or to maintain the current system where all voters vote for all five seats.
Senator Carly Wilson said she supported 
the idea of putting this question on the bal-lot.
“We thought that putting this on the bal-
lot would let democracy decide,” Wilson said.
Student Alliance party Sen. Kier Lamont 
said this issue may be too controversial in the Gainesville community for SG to take a side.
“I don’t think that’s the way to build the 
image of SG in the larger, wider communi-ty,” Lamont said.SG passes resolutions

UF had a successful outing at its first-
ever Solar Decathlon.
A group of about 40 students traveled 
to Madrid, Spain, for a 10-day competi-tion against 17 other universities to build 
a house that utilized solar energy.
UF’s house finished first in online fan 
voting. Its communications team, which 
took on promoting the event and inform-ing people about the university’s house, was also ranked first. UF finished second in the energy balance category, which measures how much energy a house cre-ates against how much it consumes. 
The team’s overall efforts ranked 
eighth in official judging. Virginia Tech, the only other American university to compete, finished first.
The house cost the Florida team 
$500,000 to build, not including the price paid for shipping the house from Gainesville to Madrid, said Kathryn Wat-son, a member of UF’s communications team.
“Our house was built with the idea 
that we want to make sure that this is something that’s viable for the average 
consumer,” Watson said.
The price was cheap compared to other 
universities’ houses, some of which cost 
more than $1 million to build, she said. 
The house was first constructed in 
Gainesville so that those involved in the project could become acquainted with 
how to build it before the actual competition. 
The house was then dis-
assembled and shipped to 
Madrid so it could be quickly re-assem-bled in less than 10 days.
Solar Decathlons were started by the 
U.S. Department of Energy in 2002 to help raise awareness for the uses of solar energy. Since 2005, they have been held biennially.
This year’s event in Madrid was the 
first to be held internationally. 
The next Solar Decathlon is scheduled 
for 2012.Solar house wins fan vote

Today’s question: Do you own a 
Netflix membership?
103 TOTAL VOTES76% YES24% NOTuesday’s question: Should stores be allowed to sell water pipes?Social In-security
It’s not every day that people’s social security numbers get accidentally 
released. Well, actually it probably does happen every day, but usually UF isn’t in-volved.
Mistakes happen every 
now and then, we get it, but we have a hard time under-standing how stuff like this seems to happen all the time. Sometimes the info is left on a lost or stolen laptop, other times, as in UF’s case, it’s due to computer error. But we’re sure most of the time the 
culprit is stupidity. Some of 
these stories would be kind of funny if they weren’t so common.
Couple this with all the re-
ports of credit card skimmers in gas station pumps, includ-ing one of the Shell stations on Newberry Road, and no matter how you slice it infor-mation security is a bigger concern than ever.
We aren’t paranoid or any-
thing. Whenever one of those hokey identity theft commer-cials comes on TV we can’t help but roll our eyes at what seems like a feeble attempt to get a few bucks out of old people who don’t understand how computers work. That said, we would prefer if there was a little more than a nine-digit number keeping people from getting a house loan in our name.
Maybe we should go back 
to signing things in blood and using wax seals. DNA is probably a little more unique than a social security num-ber, right? Of course, mak-ing that switch would bring up a whole host of sanitation concerns when the university accidentally prints that on an address label.Renter’s Rant
Netflix, Redbox killed the 
video store
It seems like every time we’re driving around town we see another video store going out of business, and it’s no sur-prise considering services like Netflix are streaming mov-
ies online for little more than the cost of two in-store rentals a month.
Even though it seems more convenient now, we really 
miss the days when we would walk into the corner video store with no clue what movie we wanted to watch. There was no way to get instant reviews or look up what other movies the actors were in. You just had to take a chance, and maybe rent two movies just in case one of them was lying about its “two thumbs-up.”
It was about having something to hold. Having a box to 
read in the car on the drive home. It was about spending 10 
minutes making popcorn and turning off all the lights in the 
house. What a waste of time, right? Just like music stores were replaced by iPods, commercials were skipped by DVRs and stopping for directions was made obsolete by cell phones, so too video stores are disappearing in favor of streaming mov-ies for a monthly bill.
We don’t really have to decide what to watch anymore 
either. Sure we have a choice in the matter. But by the time we run out of all the movies and TV reruns we’ve been ach-ing to see, we’re greeted by a list of things a computer thinks we would like. It’s about as unpredictable as getting picks from the store clerk, but it helps keep intermissions to a mini-mum.
What a wonderful world of technology we live in. We can 
watch what we want, when we want  on whatever screen we want. We don’t have to bother standing up to do it, either.
Important tips for incoming freshmen
Because entering college doesn’t come with an instruc-tion manual like your iPad does, I thought I would im-part a few quick-but-vital lessons to the newly arrived 
crop of UF students. Due to space limitations, I have broken this into a two-part series for this week and the next.
1)Spend a year living in the dorms.This is a simple solution to combat the difficulties of adjust-
ing to college life. I spent my first two nights at UF in Graham Hall for orientation and swore I would never live in a dorm, so I got an apartment, and that was that. However, I didn’t realize until much later that I only made it harder for myself 
to adjust to the college setting. The fact of the matter is, you 
just moved away from home where your mom and dad pro-
vided literally everything you needed to function normally, and now you have to do it all on your own. The best way to handle this situation is to live with a hundred other people 
who are in the same boat. Sure, it’s like spending a year at 
summer camp with no privacy and debatable personal space 
boundaries, but it’s only one year. One year where you can live with people who will be as maladjusted to adult society as you, to whom you can ask important but embarrassing questions like, “How do I do laundry?” or “What is this per-sonal hygiene thing everyone speaks so highly of?”
2)Take time learning how to make inexpensive, healthy 
meals.
High school teaches you advanced lessons in algebraic 
formulae, biologic cycles, human interaction and language composition – but not how to complete the timeless and relatively simple task of cooking yourself a healthy and cost-conscious meal. It used to, but someone high up decided that home economics was less important than AP Advanced Criti-cal Computational Analysis, or something like that and nixed it from the curriculum. So, you’re whisked off to college with cosmic problem-solving abilities and yet no concept of how to prepare a decent meal for yourself. Ramen is no better for you than eating sod off the dorm’s lawn and, unfortu-nately Panda Express does not offer a balanced nutrition program. So take a weekend, spend time with mom or dad and apply your advanced com-putational analysis skills at memoriz-ing cheap and simple college meals 
that can be prepared with primitive cooking utensils (i.e. anything you will find in the dorm).
3)Study with a purpose
Welcome to college, where classes centralize on many 
topics inapplicable to any part of functioning society beyond 
the college campus itself, and professors love to have you read books upon books to make an often simple point that 
could be summed up in about three to five paragraphs. In 
high school, the government was paying for you to expand 
your knowledge foundation to be a functioning part of so-ciety. Now you are paying for a piece of paper to get you that corner office with the private bathroom and the fake fi-chus plant. So, don’t forget that your number one purpose in studying is to pass the class. This means, you need to do what it takes to perform well on exams and essays. Often, exams and essays focus on specific portions of the readings, footnotes and an overall grasp of the subject. Therefore, you are not reading to understand every nuance of the author’s thought on the subject. You must sift through seemingly endless amounts of material to find the part of the text the teacher has hinted at in class a dozen times. If this means changing your study habit, then do it. The ability to prioritize your study time will be your greatest tool.

column will appear in next Thursday’s Alligator.

My name is Juan Hernandez. I gradu-
ated from UF last year with a history BA 
and am a regular, if casual, reader of the 
Alligator. I always appreciate the open-ness of tone and the liberal mind of the Alligator.
However, there is a fine line separat-
ing free expression and disrespect.
Yesterday, I, my family and my friends 
(of diverse backgrounds) felt attacked by the lack of prudence of one of your col-umnists. Under the title “Teeing off with 
Tom Green” there were  two or three lines 
that referred to Colombia, my country of 
birth, that were not needed at all and left us completely shocked. I won’t reproduce the text, but please check it yourself to 
understand our point of view.
In a post-racial and multicultural 
America, and even more in a diverse and 
healthy community like Gainesville, a town inhabited by college students with, 
if not liberal, at least respectful opinions, 
sentences like this can only serve to reso-
nate racial hatred and discrimination.
Sincerely,
Juan F. Hernandez

� � �Church is ignorant of Islamic faith
The politics of the Dove World Out-
reach Center has left a vile mark on the Gainesville community. The Center’s re-
cent protest against the Islamic Center 
of Gainesville, 1010 W University Ave., sent a clear message of hate, bigotry and sheer ignorance of the Islamic faith and the Muslim communities that work, study 
and raise families in Gainesville. Many 
laudable public events in Gainesville have 
encouraged and showcased interfaith un-derstanding, such as the Children of Abra-ham Seder held last year. However, the 
Monday protest was a divisive occurrence 
demonstrating the need for community 
action.
Fortunately, there are many avenues for 
the community. I have done research on the 
Muslim communities in Gainesville, and 
you can learn more about how Muslims 
actually live in Gainesville, too. One can find a podcast about Islam in Gainesville on the Samuel Proctor Oral History’s web-
site: history.ufl.edu/oral. Visit a mosque 
for Friday (jumu’ah) prayer. Moreover, I 
implore local student groups, churches, mosques and synagogues to respond to this hate speech by supporting new inter-
faith events. Only with reason and dialog 
will this abhorrent mark on out commu-
nity be lifted.

However, I learned something from

Working as a student is invaluable. 
You meet people who don’t necessar-
ily go to the same school or share the same interests. Part-time jobs teach you social skills, the value of earning your 
own money, accountability and flex-
ibility.
That being said, in any restaurant or 
retail store you can distinguish between 
a customer who has worked a similar 
job and a customer who has never been behind the counter. 
The majority of these people end up 
doing one or more of the following ig-
norant things. 
Here is what not to do when inter-
acting with the name-tag-wearing peo-
ple behind the counter:
1.Just don’t leave a tip, because we’re already getting paid, right? This is 
what we’re 
here for anyway. 
2.Blame us for things completely out 
of our control: prices, the way the food tastes, the temperature of said estab-
lishment. 
3.Treat us like we’re less than you, 
like we’re not there or like we don’t have the power to mess with the food 
we’re bringing you. 
4.Talk on the phone while we try to 
decipher between your conversation 
about how short Kim’s skirt was and 
how you don’t want your soup actually 
in the bread bowl. 
5.Tell us we’re wrong about the 
ingredients in the food item from the menu we had to memorize and have 
been eating for the entire time we’ve 
worked there.
Being disrespectful to the people 
serving you food is arrogant. A black 
apron, polo shirt, or goofy hat is not an 
excuse to abuse or disregard someone.

Construction vehicles sit idle for the evening at the site of the GRU Eastside 
Operations Center at 4747 N Main St. in Gainesville on Wednesday.
Buses will be ready for fall
RTS’ budget comes from a student 
transportation fee.
“The majority of people who 
use the buses are students,” she 
said. “It only makes sense to 
charge them. I personally use the 
bus all the time and am glad that 
the city has them for students who don’t have a car.”
The used buses have been paint-
ed orange and blue, Skinner said. RTS wanted continuity in the color of its buses, which are blue but also to appeal to UF students and fans. The buses will be used on campus, but RTS is still deciding if they will also be used around Gainesville.
Jeudy said she was thankful for 
new buses around Gainesville.
“Some of the current ones are 
just getting old,” she said. “It’ll be really nice to get some newer 
ones, even if some of them are still 
used.”
The used buses are still newer 
than most of the current fleet, Skin-
ner said. He said UF should appre-ciate the new buses because they are environmentally friendly and will not break down as much.RTS , from page 1

age patrons being turned away.
“The Swamp is a restaurant,” said Student 
Government senator Carly Wilson, who is orga-nizing the student response. “It does sell alcohol, 
but it also serves food. This is definitely discrimi-
natory against people under the age of 21 simply for being under 21.”
Wilson, along with other members of SG, Col-
lege Democrats and College Republicans, are holding a meeting to plan a response Tuesday at 6 p.m. on the first floor of the Reitz Union.
 “What we need to do is get all the individuals 
together to oppose this,” Wilson said.
Before the ordinance, there were 915 cases of 
underage drinking in 2008. In 2009 there were 444, and there have been 324 in 2010 to date, ac-cording to Gainesville Police statistics.
“Most bars actually do the right thing by polic-
ing themselves,” said GPD Capt. Ed Book. “All the ordinance does is insert itself and establish penalties for these establishments.”Opponents are planning response

Gainesville Regional Utilities has begun site 
work on a new $53.7 million, 65-acre operations 
center at 4747 N Main St.
The five-building center will house office 
space, a warehouse, a building for safety and training and a building to contain GRU’s system control center that contains the power grid. 
The new center will enable GRU to more ef-
ficiently serve its customers, said GRU project manager Reid Rivers.
“We have difficulties with transportation 
now,” he said. “But with our new site, we will have better access to highways.” 
GRU sends about 250 trucks out every day 
to do work all over town, he said, and the new location is more centrally located. 
The land GRU will leave behind, especially in the downtown area on Southeast Fourth 
Avenue, can be further developed when GRU 
leaves, he said. 
GRU’s administration building and power 
plant will remain downtown, he said, but ev-erything else will move to the new center. 
GRU plans to move into the complex by Oct. 
1, 2011.
The American Public Power Association 
gave GRU an E.F. Scattergood System Achieve-
ment Award, which goes to power companies 
that exhibit outstanding customer service.GRU outgrows downtown site

Author Eddie Mordujovich, top, looks into 
the ear of actor Joey Pantoliano on the 
steps of the Hippodrome State Theatre on 
Monday.
What’s it like to be Joey Pants?
The influential actor, known for roles like 
Cypher in “The Matrix,” Teddy in “Memen-
to,” and Ralphie in “The Sopranos,” spent 
this past week in town writing a book with 
co-author Eddie Mordujovich. Jon Silman, 
Avenue editor had the rare opportunity to 
interview the Emmy-winning actor during 
his short Gainesville sojourn.
“I can be incredibly dogmatic with people 
and tease them and play with them and 
even put them down. And you know 8 out 
of 10 people just love that Joey Pants is 
breaking their balls,” he said. “I used to 
have an assistant. I would say, ‘Emulate 
me! She’d say, ‘I can’t emulate you, I’m 
not you, ya f--k! If I emulate you, I’d get 
fired!’’’
In case you haven’t noticed, Joey Pants is 
kind of a wild card. 
My interview with Mr. Pantoliano was 
scheduled for Tuesday at a new restau-
rant in town, The Warehouse. I was told 
it would be a “working dinner” by his 
handlers. In true celebrity fashion, he was 
an hour late. 
But the thing is, when the man walked 
through the doors of the restaurant it was 
a subtle human explosion. He has this sort 
of energy that made me question the 
potential of personality. He was magnetic, 
endearing and extremely polite. He was 
boisterous in his approach, and when he 
got to the table he immediately had the 
whole room’s attention. The waitress was 
hovering, the table was noisy. And in the 
midst of all this I was battling for his at-
tention. Joey Pants visits Gainesville  
‘Best Worst Movie’ highlights quirky cult following of film
By ERIN RAUCH
avenue writer
No, “Troll 2” has nothing to do with “Troll 
1.” No, this is not the best movie you will ever 
see. It is simply the best worst movie.
Whether you are a troll-head or not, “Best 
Worst Movie” is insightful, energetic and hys-
terical enough to convert any movie fanatic to the cult “Troll 2” created.
The Hippodrome State Theatre is pre -
miering the movie on Friday, and it will run through July 15. For tickets and movie times visit thehipp.org. 
Director Michael Paul Stephenson, who 
played the 10-year-old star in “Troll 2,” pro -
vides the audience with a behind-the-scenes look into the actors’ lives and the cult their 
shoddy acting created, post goblin takeover.
Dr. George Hardy starred in “Troll 2” as the father of the vacationing family. He now lives in Alexander City, Ala., and works as a 
dentist.
According to his ex-wife, “Everybody loves 
him.” After all, you simply can’t hate a man 
who wears an oversized, pink tooth-fairy cos-
tume with a pair of ‘90s-esque rollerblades in the town Christmas parade.
As a “Troll 2” virgin myself, “Best Worst 
Movie” provided an intriguing and uplifting 
insight into the phenomenon surrounding 
this unconventional 1990s horror film.
The 95-minute film invites the audience 
into the unprecedented fame that surrounds the actors who are best known for playing in 
a film IMDb.com users have rated two out of 
10.
Twenty years after the release of “Troll 
2,” audiences around the country no longer 
revile the film. Instead, they are becoming almost as fanatical as tweens with Bieber-fever. 
One fan watched the movie twice in one 
day and another has hosted five screening 
parties.
Some of the actors aren’t laughing along 
with the audience. One of the film’s stars refuses to include the movie on her resume when auditioning 
for acting jobs.
When Hardy isn’t rid-
ding Alexander City of gin-
givitis and gum disease, 
fans follow him as he tours the country to at-
tend the plethora of “Troll 2”-inspired parties 
and screenings. 
He is one of the numerous cast members 
who embraced the stardom the cult following 
has generated.Whether you understand the meaning of 
“Troll 2” (hell, the actors even admitted to 
not knowing what the film was about) or not, after viewing the “Best Worst Movie” you’ll 
find yourself anticipating the arrival of “Troll 
2: Part 2.”
That’s right, “Troll 2” director Claudio Fra-
gasso and screenplay writer Rosella Drudi 
plan to make a sequel. 
Whether they will employ the original ac-
tors is debatable (Fragasso refers to the ac-
tors as dogs in the film). 
Either way, Hardy said he is ready to grace 
the screen with his ample grin once again.
But be warned, if you haven’t already seen 
“Troll 2,” Stephenson’s unique storyline will entice you to run to the nearest Blockbuster 
(if it hasn’t already closed) to catch the fever 
that is running rampant through the movie scene.

aveToon Road trips test manhood
If there is one great American rite of 
passage, it is the road trip. Haphaz-ardly shoving people and belongings 
into a car and debauching ourselves across state lines is about as Ameri-
can as apple pie baked by underpaid 
immigrant laborers.
There is nothing quite like ventur -
ing a great distance with only a youth-ful exuberance and sense of adven-ture (and a Google Maps printout). Of course, the reason road trips are so exciting is because so much can go wrong—and something always does. 
In these crises, however, charac-
ter is made and we find out what sort of stuff we are made of. It is where beards are grown, boys become men, men become double men and girls become panicky bunches of no-help-at-all.
One such situation occurred while 
my recent trip was in its early stages: 
Somewhere in Georgia, one of the 
tires suffered a fatal puncture wound. Because I was the only person in the car who had ever changed a tire be -
fore, I was appointed the savior of the group. We pulled into the parking lot of a KFC, where our 
hissing tire 
attracted the attention of a youth group. 
I wouldn’t 
have paid it 
any mind, if only it didn’t start to pro -
vide the least effective roadside assis-tance of all time. 
I had to pull all the luggage out 
of the trunk to get to the spare, and instead of helping, the leader of the group provided commentary on our luggage and our situation:
“You guys have a lot of stuff. Where 
ya headed? What are you guys gon-na be doing there? Oh, that’s a first aid kit, in case anyone gets hurt and 
needs first aid. That’s an emergency 
blanket, in case you get lost and need a blanket. You guys look like artists.”

(continued from page 9...) “I was working with 
Eddie on a book, and he got hurt. So I came down 
here because we got a deadline, and I wanted to make it easy for him. The book is called “Tales 
from the Great Depression,” well, that’s the work -
ing title. It deals with my recovery from mental 
disease.”
He paused for a second, trying to collect his 
thoughts, and mentioned that it was hard for him to talk with all the chatter around him. We decided to move the interview to the lobby of the restaurant to a cushioned bench on the side wall across from the hostess’s station. As we walked 
down the middle of the room, I felt people’s eyes 
trying not to stare at him when he passed, some with those looks of dusty recognition, like they couldn’t place the face. 
“One of my issues is that I have attention 
deficit disorder. I don’t take Ritalin, but I do take something like that.”
Sitting face to face with Pantoliano I noticed a 
few things. He smelled pristine. He was dressed immaculately. A clean, white button-up tucked 
into khakis with a light-blue vest and brown leath-
er, patterned cowboy boots. The man likes jewel-ry. Three necklaces, two rings on each hand and a bracelet he told me cost five grand. I wanted to understand why this man told me so offhandedly that he suffered from a mental disease.
He explained that he was filming a movie 
around 2006, and as a matter of procedure he was asked to undergo a physical. The insurance 
company funding the project felt he was a risk be -
cause he was taking anti-depressants. It asked 
him to sign a waiver stating that if there was stop-page due to a nervous breakdown or something similar he would be financially responsible. 
“I said, ‘Wait, I have a history of heart disease. 
I take [a] statin for my cholesterol. Why are you in-suring my heart but not my brain? And they didn’t have a good answer for that.”
With this as his impetus, Pantoliano started a 
charity called No kidding, Me Too!, with a mission of removing the stigma attached to brain “dis-ease through education and the breaking down of societal barriers.” The goal is to get people to “admit their illness, seek treatment and become even greater members of society.”
During this passionate speech about  his  ex-
periences with clinical depression, I was struck with this man’s ability to channel himself emo -
tionally. He drew me in with his charisma. He ex-plained that when your child is sick with asthma 
you take them to the doctor, but when he’s depressed you just don’t talk about it, and therein lies the prob-
lem. People should talk 
about feeling depressed or mentally unstable, so that they can get help.
“Stigma is predicated 
on discrimination,” he said. “It’s not stigma, it’s preju -
dice.”
 The actor said he’s been blessed to have over 
a 30-year career in the movie business, and his acting talent is helped by his mental difficulties. As an actor he was encouraged to have a child-like wonder and spontaneity, qualities that don’t bode well for the real world, he said.
“If I’m spontaneous and this waitress wants to f--k me (he pointed to a waitress who walked 
by), that’s gonna get me in a lot of trouble with 
my wife.”
He thought when he became rich and famous 
he’d finally be happy, but it wasn’t so. He devel-oped an addiction to painkillers and said at one point he took a bunch of them in the hopes that he wouldn’t wake up in the morning.
Today, Pantoliano is in a 12-step recovery pro-
gram, and said he is happier and more cognizant 
of things now than he’s ever been. The most im-
portant thing in life isn’t fame or riches, but love and family, he said.
“I wanted to make enough money for my chil-
dren and my children’s children, but the truth is unless they make their own money they’re going to have miserable lives.”
After the interview I left Pantoliano at a table, 
surrounded by women. He was telling stories 
about being famous and acting in movies that 
I’d seen dozens of times growing up. It was so strange to see this man, full of personality, spar -
kling in his element. There was a disparity be -
tween the entertainer and the man. But I guess that’s just Joey Pants.By KAT BEIN

UF’s campus may be tobacco-free, but 
Gainesville still has its head in the clouds.
Walking down the 1100 block of West Univer -
sity Avenue at night, one is bombarded with the 
smells of fruity molasses and Turkish coffee.
The fact is, Gainesville is hooked on hookah.Of course, it’s not just this town. According to 
a Virginia Commonwealth University study, 43 percent of adults ages 18 to 21 have toked on the hose in the last year.
Hookah bars are particularly popular around 
college campuses, because everyone knows college is a place to become more cultured, or at least more lightheaded. But how is one sup-posed to differentiate between bars when there are, at least in one case, three on the same 
block? For those of you living in the boondocks, 
AKA Gainesville west of 34th Street, the best bet is Hookah Nite Café, 2614 SW 34th St.
It looks a little shady from the outside, but 
once inside the customer is transported to a Turkish oasis. The lights are dim, the hookahs are tall and prices range from $10 to $15.
It’s a more traditional kind of atmosphere. 
The owners play Indian music videos on large TV 
screens and orange and red lamps hang from the 
ceiling. Guests sit comfortably on cushy couches, and lounging is allowed.
Of course, if you live downtown, it’s hardly like -
ly you’ll go so out of your way for a smoke break.
Consider this scenario: Your folks have come to visit during Family weekend and they want to get a glimpse of what you’ve been spending all their money on. You can’t take them to the club—that drunk guy or girl might try to talk to you—so why not share a hookah with them instead?
In this case, you should take them to Farah’s on the Avenue, 1120 W University Ave. It’s half restaurant, half hookah lounge, with tobacco prices between $10 and $22.
It has a list of specialty flavors, Skittles being 
the most popular. Oh yeah, and there’s a fully stocked bar.
Haven’t had enough? As you’re leaving 
Farah’s, look across the street. There are two more hookah bars for you to enjoy.
You’re likely to come upon Hookah Hutt first, 
at 1029 W University Ave. Smaller than Farah’s, it offers a more intimate environment and a friend-ly atmosphere for regulars.
“It’s very chill, very relaxed, not really uptight,” 
said employee Jeff Tamayo. “Our pants aren’t way up high.”
Regular customers at the Hutt can play their 
own music in the club for a personal touch not 
found in most places.
And just down the street there’s another op-
tion, Kava Lounge, 1007 W University Ave., offer -
ing a drink made from the earthy kava root.
Andrew Schild, 23, said he loves smoking 
hookah and prefers to come to Kava Lounge 
when smoking in the city because of the friendly service.
“I was well-tended to,” he said. “But not ob-
noxiously so.”
Schild said even with the over-saturation of 
the market, he doesn’t see hookah going out of 
style anytime soon.
“Because of the social element, the relaxing
atmosphere and ability to loosen up after a 
long day,” he said. “It makes hookah perfect.”THURSDAY, JULY 8, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

Emmy winning actor Joey Pants talks illness, lifeBy MARISSA PRIETO

In the Summer heat, men’s fash -
ion can sometimes take a backseat to 
staying cool, but it doesn’t have to be 
that way.
With breezy options like the tank 
top, the short-sleeved button-up and 
linen shorts, style can accommodate 
comfort for all occasions.
Wolfgang, a local boutique, along 
with department stores like Macy’s 
and American Apparel, cued us in on 
the latest colors and patterns of a 
man’s summer essentials.
TOPS:
Tank tops are an easy, lightweight 
staple that allow guys to beat the 
Gainesville heat, said Matthew Turner, 
owner of Wolfgang.
“Guys have really been liking the 
long, baggy, interesting-print tank-top 
look,” Turner said. “I steer more to -
wards natural colors, like browns and 
tans, with pops of colors in there for a 
softer palette in the summer.”
Don’t be afraid to throw some pat -
terns in the mix, either. Plaids always 
do very well and so do different kinds 
of vintage, Southern patterns, Turner 
said.
If the event calls for more than a 
tank top, the short-sleeved button-up 
is always a simple way to dress up 
without putting in much effort. With 
many variations of solid colors, stripes 
and plaids, every guy is sure to find one that works for him.
“The nautical-style button-ups, in 
mostly blues and grays, are huge right 
now,” said Brett Kapper, assistant 
manager and merchandiser at Ameri -
can Apparel. “Fashion for the summer 
is to look like you’ve been out on the 
boat all day.”
Tucking in the button-up gives an 
outfit a more put-together look.
Macy’s is also noticing a nautical 
trend in its clothing lines, said Can -
dace Valentine, manager of the men’s 
department at the Oaks Mall.
Polo shirts themselves work for ev -
ery season and can be paired with your 
favorite shorts. This summer, check 
out the cooler colors like light blues, 
light yellows, whites and grays.
Last but not least, there are always 
the V-neck and graphic tees that can 
go with any pair of shorts or pants.
BOTTOMS:
When it comes to summer apparel, 
shorts are the most obvious answer. 
Turner recommends avoiding longer, 
baggier shorts in favor of those that 
fall just above or at the knee.
“I’ve gotten in some darker, bur -
gundy colors, some medium-to-darker 
blues, seersucker stripes, chambray 
and baby corduroy shorts,” Turner 
said.
Linen shorts can also be great in 
this weather, Kapper said. Neutral col -
ors like khaki and navy are always in, 
but more exotic ones like peach, but -
ter, soft greens and lavender can add some color to your summer wardrobe.
“The important thing to remember 
when buying shorts is to get a neutral 
pair,” Kapper said. “That way, you can 
save money by wearing the same pair 
and matching it up with many different 
tops.”
Plaid shorts are another alterna -
tive.
“We’ve had a huge statement of 
polos and plaid shorts,” Valentine 
said. “It’s pretty standard and plain, 
but it still seems to be working.”
Tip: If you can’t part with your favor -
ite pair of pants (and yes, sometimes 
they are necessary), try rolling them up 
a few times for a cuffed look.
ACCESSORIES:
In the summer, sunglasses seem 
like more of a necessity rather than an 
accessory, but they can always add a 
nice touch.
Bright, ‘80s-style square frames 
with interesting lenses are in right now, 
Turner said.
“I sell a ridiculous amount of sun -
glasses,” Turner said. “Everyone is still 
in their Ray-Ban Wayfarer kick.”
With the insane variety of Wayfarer 
lookalikes nowadays, every guy can 
find an affordable pair at most retail 
stores.
MAKING IT HAPPEN:
With all the options that are out on 
the market, guys should have no prob -
lem finding the perfect outfit, whether 
it’s for class, work or the beach.12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 8, 2010

It’s about to become even easier 
to find porn online. 
The Internet Corporation for As-
signed Names and Numbers ap-
proved a new top-level domain regis-
try, “.xxx,” for adult sites June 25.
It has been toying with the contro-
versial domain since 2005.
Supporters argue that this will 
make it easier to filter adult content. 
One company, ICM Registry was in-strumental in the final decision.
According to its website, ICM 
worked for the past six years gather -
ing support.
“It’s been a long time coming,” 
said chairman Stuart Lawley. “This is great news.”
But not everyone is excited to see 
the barely legal domain in action. Mike Strother, a 20-year veteran of the adult industry, is calling shenani-gans. 
“This government has been try -
ing to circumvent the First Amend-ment in terms of the adult industry for years,” Strother said.
He said this will lead to confu -
sion. If someone owns “sex.com” and another person owns “sex.net,” who gets the rights to “sex.xxx?” Not to mention, who gets to decide what counts as adult material?
“It is a tool for censorship,” he 
said. “It makes it too easy for a gov -
ernment to say ‘If you’re on an adult 
site, you need a “.xxx” domain.’”.xxx ordinance passes  Pool hall is laid back, affordablebars

Gainesville has an array of bars and clubs, but few 
are as unpretentious and laid-back as the new Palomino 
Pool Hall downtown.
From the outside, Palamino looks like a white-washed, 
Alamo-style warehouse. Inside, nine pool tables take up 
most of the space’s open floor plan. A row of old audito -
rium seats and a few dozen stools provide the only indoor 
seating. Most people stand, though, as they alternate playing pool and drinking beer.
Palomino opened in February after six months of ren-
ovations. Located in a former Pontiac service station, the building has retained its no-frills exterior while the interior is clean and comfortable.
“[The owners of Palomino] were bummed when Hap-
py Hour Billiards closed. It was a spot where the commu -
nity could come hang out. That’s the void we’re trying to fill here,” co-owner Jeff McMullen said.
The most refreshing aspect of the Palomino is that the community is well represented. Besides the typical 
college-student crowd, patrons range from teenagers to 
baby boomers. Palomino is also one of the few places in town that remains all ages during business hours.
“We don’t really cater to any crowd in particular. You’ll 
see a lot of different types of people -- some just grabbing a beer after work and other people coming just to hang out,” McMullen said.
Pool is $4 an hour before 7 p.m. and all day on Sun-
days. After 7 p.m., it’s $7 an hour. In addition to pool, 
Palomino offers free foosball and pingpong. 
One of Palomino’s most unique features is the out-
door patio sandwiched between the pool hall and Boca 
Fiesta. The area features an outdoor bar and live music most weekends. String lights stretch across the patio, creating a casual and inviting atmosphere.
Palomino’s mission is straightforward: “We’re about 
cheap beers, cheap pool and free jukebox,” McMullen said.
Mission accomplished. Palamino is located at 19 SE 
second Place.

POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG INSIDEBy TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
 
The Super Six appeared to be dead, but the 
NCAA resurrected it.
Following a near-unanimous vote last summer at the college gymnastics coaches’ 
annual meetings, a motion was passed to do 
away with the Super Six format and reduce 
the number of teams in the finals to four.
But at this year’s meetings in Dallas in May, 
college gymnastics coaches voted to overturn that ruling in a unanimous vote.The vote had to wait for approval from the 
NCAA Sports Management Cabinet, which 
convened in Indianapolis from June 15-16.
The cabinet approved of the coaches’ vote 
to re-institute the Super Six format.
“The cabinet agreed to rescind action taken 
… related to the championship format,” the NCAA’s recently released report stated. “It 
was noted that new information related to po-
tential media coverage impacted the original 
recommendation.”
When the coaches originally voted to 
change the format, it was done with hopes of having the championships aired on live TV.
At the time of the original vote, Florida 
coach Rhonda Faehn was the only coach to vote against the proposed change.
“I wanted something in writing from CBS 
... before voting to limit the opportunities for our student-athletes,” Faehn said.
After this year’s NCAA Men’s Basketball 
Tournament, the NCAA opted out of a multi-sport contract with CBS that left gymnastics 
high and dry while the NCAA cut a new 14-
year, $11 billion deal with CBS to air all of the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament games.
As a result, college gymnastics has no con-
tract to air its championship meets.
“When coaches found out that CBS had re-
structured their whole programming package and wouldn’t be televising us live, it shocked a lot of coaches and upset many of them,” Faehn said. “That wasn’t our goal … we want to have as much participation as possible if the TV wasn’t going to be there.”
At the May meeting, the coaches unani-
mously voted to overturn the initial vote in hopes of doing what they think is best for the future growth of college gymnastics.
“I don’t have a crystal ball,” Faehn said. 
“I wish I could say I know what’s best for the sport or what’s going to promote growth. ... I don’t necessarily think that one  televised competition focusing in on four teams  is go-
ing to help increase participation in our sport 
throughout this country.”

UF gymnastics coach Rhonda Faehn was the only coach last summer to vote against a proposal to change the NCAA finals from six 
teams to four. The coaches voted again in May to overturn the previous vote and the NCAA will keep the Super Six format.

We only have ourselves to 
blame for this.
NBA superstar LeBron 
James is pushing boundaries once again. “King James,” as he refers to 
himself, will announce the team he 
will sign with tonight at 9 p.m. in a one-hour long special on ESPN.
Most of America will criticize 
this seemingly ego-driven decision, but America will also still watch. 
This form of hypocrisy is exactly 
the reason it has reached this point.
Society’s hunger for a Holly-
wood influence on sports created this monster, and it will only con-tinue to grow.
Everybody thought the Brett 
Favre saga was dreadful, but this NBA free-agency period has been downright painful to watch. This 
has made Favre look like a down to 
earth average Joe.
It has just been a bunch of multi-
millionaires getting wooed and complimented by billionaires, NBA legends and hip-hop icons.
This is what we have come to. James is trying to justify this 
gross decision by donating the pro-
ceeds of his television special to the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of America. I’m sure they will make millions of dollars off of this, but it 
still doesn’t 
help him in my eyes.
S p o r t s 
used to be about the teams, not 
the players. Now leagues tend to get most of their publicity from off-the-
field issues in the offseason.
Look at Ben Roethlisberger’s in-cident, the yearly Favre issue and 
baseball’s past steroid problems.
James is no different. He has un-
dergone a transformation.
He grew up in little old Akron, 
Ohio, and said he missed the social media craze because he skipped college. But now he has a Twitter account, a newly-launched website and one-hour of national television dedicated to himself.
Isn’t this what everybody wanted 
ever since ESPN televised his high school games? Of course James has 
an ego. America created it.
This press conference is sure to become a trend.
So, don’t be surprised. Because 
what used to be reserved for high 
school athletes is soon to become the expected method of announcing 
your new professional team. 
The only way to stop this is to 
not watch tonight. But that isn’t go-
ing to happen. The one-hour special is must-see TV. 
As you sit down on your couch 
and learn where James will play for the second half of his career, remem-ber one thing: this was your doing.
He wouldn’t be “The King” if we 
wouldn’t have crowned him.

�ESPN’s decision to air LeBron James’ decision on its network puts its reporters 
in a bind. If they receive a scoop on where the King is going to sign, do they leak the information and ruin the hour-long special? It shouldn’t matter. By the way ESPN’s NBA talking heads have reported during this free-agency period, it would be false info anyway. It should only add to the suspense.� The alligatorSports college foot-

 Southern California has apologized to 
Florida, Alabama and Washington for accus-
ing those schools of breaking NCAA rules by 
contacting one of the Trojans’ players without 
permission.
  In a letter dated July 1 and addressed to 
Florida athletic director Jeremy Foley, USC AD Mike Garrett said freshman running back Dil-lon Baxter conﬁ  rmed to Garrett that the player 
“did not receive a call from your institution.”
  “I apologize for any inconvenience or em-
barrassment this matter has caused to you and 
your institution,” Garrett wrote in a hand-signed letter.
  The letter to Foley was obtained by The As-
sociated Press. Spokesmen for Alabama and Washington also conﬁ  rmed Wednesday that their athletic directors received apology let-ters from USC.
  ESPN.com reported USC ﬁ  led a complaint 
with the Pac-10 in June about several schools tampering with Baxter after the Trojans were hit with NCAA sanctions.
  Pac-10 spokeswoman Danette Leighton 
told the AP in an e-mail that it was the confer-
ence’s policy not to comment on enforcement 
matters.
  USC received a two-year postseason ban, a 
loss of scholarships and was forced to vacate victories from the 2004 and 2005 seasons for 
NCAA violations involving former star tail-
back Reggie Bush.
  Because of the sanctions, 
USC upperclassmen are al-
lowed to transfer without the 
usual NCAA restrictions, but only juniors and 
seniors can be contacted by other schools.
  New USC coach Lane Kifﬁ  n got himself 
into trouble last year when he was at Tennes-
see for unjustly accusing Florida coach Urban 
Meyer of breaking NCAA recruiting rules. 
Kifﬁ  n later had to apologize to Meyer and the 
Gators.
  Kifﬁ  n is in his ﬁ  rst year at USC after spend-
ing one tumultuous season at Tennessee, 
where he ﬁ  nished with a record of 7-6. USC AD issues apology to UF

 Today we continue the alliga-
torSports’ countdown of the top 10 
college football teams heading into the 2010 season with the No. 9 team 
in our poll: the Oklahoma Sooners.
  The Sooners are coming off a 
disappointing season in which they 
ﬁ  nished 8-5 and were relegated to a trip to the Sun Bowl against Stan-ford. The bowl game marked just the third time in the last decade that Oklahoma did not play in a BCS bowl game.
  The seven BCS bowls for the 
Sooners since 2000 speak to the consistency of Oklahoma’s pro-gram, and that is in large part due to who the team has roaming the sidelines – Bob Stoops.  Stoops, who is entering his 12th 
season as OU’s head coach, has built up quite a program during his tenure in Norman, Okla.
  Over the span of Stoops’ head 
coaching career, the Sooners have 
gone 117-29, and have only lost at 
home twice. 
  Needless to say, Stoops knows 
how to build a team through 
recruiting, and then coach that talent up to its potential on the 
ﬁ  eld.
  This year 
should be no dif-
ferent, as Stoops 
helped Oklahoma bring in another elite recruiting class, which Rivals.com ranked as the seventh-best in the nation.
  After last season’s 8-5 disap-
pointment, the Sooners were rav-aged by the NFL Draft, having four  No. 9 Oklahoma:

Despite the loss of defensive tackle Gerald McCoy (93), the third overall selection in the 2010 NFL Draft, 
Oklahoma returns linebacker Travis Lewis (28), who led the Sooners with 109 tackles last season.

When the Southeastern Conference all-time digs 
leader, Elyse Cusack, graduated and Colleen Ward and 
Brynja Rodgers decided to transfer because of personal reasons, depth was thought to be a problem heading into 
this season.
Now, it appears to be a strength.
The addition of transfers Stephanie Ferrell, Cinthya 
Roberto and Tangerine Wiggs changed things.
“(Outside hitters Ferrell and Roberto, and opposite 
hitter Wiggs) give us depth at two different positions,” said coach Mary Wise, who announced the new transfers on June 30. “I think depth and experience are two of the keys to successful college teams.”
Those three players will join seniors Lauren Bledsoe, 
Erin Fleming and Callie Rivers, and juniors Kelly Mur-phy, Kristy Jaeckel and Cassandra Anderson as the core of the squad.
The unexpected loss of Ward and Rodgers opened the 
door for the new trio. 
The fact that the Gators were able to add two juniors in 
Ferrell and Roberto, and a sophomore in Wiggs gives Wise a better idea of what to 
expect from them on the college level.
“You can’t get transfers in without 
open scholarships,” Wise said. “When 
you are looking at transfers you aren’t projecting out quite as far as when you 
are recruiting high school talent. It gives us a better sense in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, and what they give us fits to the exact need of what needed to be ad-dressed.”
Ferrell started for a Hawaii squad that made the semi-
finals of the NCAA Tournament last season. Meanwhile, Roberto also brings some experience after being named as 
a two-time junior college All-American at Blinn College.
However, Wiggs doesn’t have as much college volley-
ball under her belt, but Wise expects her to do a lot of 
damage in the blocking department. 
Still, these three players don’t address one glaring loss 
from last season – the graduation of Cusack.
Fleming is expected to fill that libero spot after an im-
pressive spring. She didn’t start a match last season and picked up just 37 digs in limited time.
“(Fleming) may have had as good a spring as we have 
ever had from a player,” Wise said. “She is playing the best volleyball of her career. The position was wide open and Erin just earned it.”Gators add 
three transfersJones, Murray have Heisman potential
players drafted in the first round 
and seven in total were selected.
The most notable thing about 
the draft was that three of the first four picks in the draft were Sooners, 
including Sam Bradford, the 2008 
Heisman winner who was drafted No. 1 overall by the St. Louis Rams.
Despite losing Bradford to the 
NFL, Oklahoma is already used to life without the Heisman winner. The team lost him to a shoulder in-jury at the beginning of last season, and despite an effort to return, lost 
him for the entire year. 
Fortunately for the Sooners, ris-
ing redshirt sophomore Landry Jones proved to be a capable heir to 
Bradford as he threw for 3,198 yards and 26 touchdowns last season. 
Jones also threw 14 interceptions, in 
his first year under center.
Jones won’t be the only offensive 
weapon the Sooners return, as senior running back DeMarco Murray will 
be in the backfield again this year. 
Murray ran for 705 yards and eight touchdowns while gaining 522 yards and four scores through the air.
Oddsmakers list both Jones and 
Murray as Heisman contenders go-ing into the season.
The Sooners also lost tight end 
Jermaine Gresham, but return a vet-eran receiving corps that includes junior Ryan Broyles, who caught 89 passes for 1,120 yards and 15 touch-downs in 2009.
On the other side of the ball, OU 
returns rising junior linebacker Tra-vis Lewis, who led the team in tack-les for the last two seasons, defensive end Jeremy Beal, who led the team in sacks last season with 11, and senior 
safety Quinton Carter, who tied for 
the team lead in interceptions and was second to Lewis in tackles.
Even though the Sooners lost 
some elite talent to the NFL Draft, the cupboards are not bare. Com-bine the team returning some of its best skill players with a top recruit-ing class and Stoops at the helm, and the Sooners will field another team that will vie for a Big 12 title.

NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
DAVIE — Dwyane Wade’s fu-
ture was muddled and uncertain, 
until Chris Bosh told him where he wanted to spend the next few 
years.
“I’m feeling Miami,” Bosh said.
Those three words were all Wade 
needed to make his decision.
Will they be enough to sway Le-
Bron James to Miami? Stay tuned.
Ending months of specula-
tion, Wade and Bosh announced Wednesday that they’ll sign with 
Miami, two decisions that vault 
the Heat back into the NBA cham-pionship picture and puts them two-thirds of the way to hitting one of the biggest trifectas in NBA his-tory. Wade, Bosh and James all have talked about playing together. On Thursday night, James will say why that will or will not happen.
“It’s over,” Wade said in an in-
terview with The Associated Press. “It’s not all over-over, but for me, it’s over.”
James can’t say that yet.Wade told the Heat that for him 
to re-sign, the team had to add ei-ther James or Bosh. For good mea-sure, they might get both.
“It had to be one or the other,” 
Wade said in the AP interview. “Of course, there’s a lot of talented play-ers in this league. But you want to look at players that complement my game, and Chris and LeBron are two of those guys. I had a decision to make. Chris had a decision to make. It wasn’t a lock that he would 
come to Miami. So I had a lot to 
think about.”
Now, the ball is in King James’ 
court.
“I expect us to compete for a 
championship,” Bosh told ESPN. “I think both Dwyane and I, we both wanted an opportunity where right away we would be compet-
ing. ... We’re ready to sacrifice a lot 
of things in order to do that. It’s not about the money. It’s not about any-thing else except for winning. I’m a winner. Dwyane’s a winner. We’re going to bring winning to Miami.”
That was Heat president Pat Ri-ley’s plan.
Around the NBA, the immediate 
reaction was that Miami is poised to be in the mix for the 2011 title.
“It just makes the East that much 
better,” Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers said in Orlando, Fla., where he was watching summer league games.
Magic coach Stan Van Gundy 
was more succinct, lauding Bosh as 
“one of the best 
forwards in bas-
ketball.”
“I think they’re 
instant contend-
ers,” Van Gundy said. “I don’t think there’s any doubt. They’re instant contend-
ers to win an NBA championship.”
For Wade, the decision came 
down to Miami vs. Chicago, adopt-ed hometown vs. actual hometown.
The Bulls almost pulled it off, 
until Bosh said he was bullish on Miami.
“The good part of this was con-trolling your own destiny,” Wade told the AP. “It really meant a lot to me, and I’m sure if you ask Chris or ask LeBron, they’d say the same. 
You have a say-so. You can control 
the destiny of where and what’s best for you. And it’s not many times in your life or your career if you’re go-ing to have that. This is it.”
Wade does not know what the 
terms of his contract will be (he could receive up to $126 million for six years but told AP he would take 
less if necessary to make other deals 
work). Bosh doesn’t have terms of his deal done either. It’s all contin-gent on what James says Thursday night, and Wade insisted he knows nothing about what the two-time MVP will say or where he’ll be say-ing it from.
“I won’t speak to him again until 
he makes his decision,” Wade said in the AP interview. “And when it’s over, I will congratulate him.”
Miami came into free agency 
with around $44 million of cap space, not including $16 million or so earmarked for Wade, thanks to years of avoiding just about any deal where money would have been committed for the 2010-11 season.
It was high-stakes poker, and 
Riley went all-in that he could get something done to make Wade happy.
Citing league rules, the Heat 
couldn’t express their glee Wednes-day, since the NBA’s signing mora-torium was ongoing.
Wade’s oldest son, however, 
isn’t bound by any restrictions.
Zaire Wade, 8, was awoken by 
his father Wednesday with the news: Daddy’s staying in Miami.
“For real? Cool,” Zaire replied.Wade knew he made the right 
choice.
“I felt great this morning, waking 
up knowing I’ve got another chap-ter behind me,” Wade told the AP. 
“Coming into the summer, I knew 
that I had a court case here, court case there, custody, all these things. Just took one step at a time, and this is another step in the journey of where I wanted to go, forward, not backward.”
