� THE RESTAURANT SELLS KOSHER MEALS INSIDE 
THE CENTER. 
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Staff Writer calcantara@alligator.org
Two advertisements released by a kosher meal vendor dur-
ing the Summer have sparked a legal dispute about UF Hillel’s 
tax exemption status in Alachua County.
The issue focuses on Sababa UF restaurant, which sells ko-
sher meals to students in a 1,416-square-foot area inside the center, located at 2020 W. University Ave. Hillel and the Ala-
chua County Property Appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce will meet today with 
county ofﬁ  cials to determine whether the space is considered 
tax exempt.The meeting comes nearly a month after Yvonne Yegge, a 
licensed attorney who oversaw the matter, wrote in an ofﬁ  cial recommendation to the county’s Value Adjustment Board that the appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce’s decision to deny religious tax exemp-
tion for the space was invalid.
During the Summer, Sababa released a Groupon discount 
and a television commercial advertising its Mediterranean and vegan food.
Rabbi Lou Feldstein, Hillel’s interim executive director and 
CEO, said Sababa did not have Hillel’s approval to release the Hillel, county in tax squabble over Sababa UF restaurant 
“It’s a core component to our commitment 
to service the needs of the Jewish Student 
Body and Jewish community of the University of 
Florida.”

Senate President Lauren Verno, center, and other Swamp Party members celebrate winning 48 out of 
50 seats in the Fall election Wednesday evening in the Reitz Union breezeway.

The Reitz Union breezeway 
echoed with cheers as a sea of Swamp Party supporters cel-ebrated the party’s near-sweep of Senate seats Wednesday night.
Swamp Party dominated in 
the Fall 2013 Student Govern-ment elections, claiming 48 out of 50 seats. Students Party walked 
away with two seats: Murphree 
Area and District E.
Swamp Party spokesman Jo-
seph Michaels’ high hopes were met.
“We can’t wait to prove all the 
voters right,” he said.
A total of 8,766 ballots were 
cast, falling behind last Fall’s turnout of 9,197 votes and the 
10,048 votes in Spring 2013. In 
Fall elections, students vote based on where they live.
Supervisor of Elections Justin 
Hoover announced the results to 
an excited crowd at about 9:40 
p.m. The time of the announcement 
was changed from midnight af-ter election codes were amended 
this Summer. The location of the 
announcement, which is usually outside of Orange & Brew, was relocated to the breezeway be-cause of construction.
A total of 511 votes were cast 
for District E, which includes any zip code outside of Gainesville. Students whose correct local ad-dress isn’t registered with the UF Registrar are often mistakenly placed within this district. 
Last Fall, 1,806 votes were cast 
in District E, when several stu-dents were incorrectly registered. Classiﬁ  cation errors also occurred in the Fall 2011 elections.
Overall, Hoover said he was 
more than happy with the strong turnout.
But last to arrive and ﬁ  rst to 
leave the breezeway, Students Party members weren’t thrilled with the outcome.
“We’re disappointed but not 
deterred,” said Helie Dharia, Stu-dents Party campaign manager. STUDENTS SWAMPED

They are the least religious, the most tech-
nologically savvy and the best-educated citi-
zens in America’s history. They are the millen-nial generation — or so a Pew Research Center study that’s recently been in the news seems 
to indicate.
As the generation of 18- to 29-year-olds continues to grow, its dependence on social 
media continues to affect the workforce, ac-cording to the study, titled “Millennials: A Portrait of Generation Next.”
When asked what makes their generation 
unique, millennial respondents’ top answers 
were technology use, and music and pop cul-
ture.
Millennials’ use of technology can make 
their work ethic look different, said Edmund Kellerman, a UF organiza-tional communications pro-fessor.
“In our generation, if 
business was slow, you’d 
go and do something to im-
prove the store. But these 
days, you have to go and check that phone ﬁ  rst,” Kellerman said.
Technology is increasingly taking the place 
of face-to-face communication, a term called the interpersonal divide, said Diana Nagy, a communications studies professor at UF.
There may be valid reason for the heavy 
technology use among millennials, though.
“One of the things we know about millen-
nials is that they are the most stressed-out gen-
eration ever,” Nagy said.
Iesha Storr, a 20-year-old ﬁ  rst-year law stu-
dent at the UF Levin College of Law, said she 
agrees.
“Whenever I’m studying for a few hours, I 
always take a break every now and then and check Facebook,” Storr said. “It reminds me that there’s life outside of my books.”Millennials, technology changing face of work ethic, study says

Ash, noise and angry emails in 
recent weeks linked to the biomass 
power plant culminated in the City Commission’s decision to have a special meeting Wednesday for resi-
dents to voice opinions and hear of-
ficial comment. 
The commission and residents 
discussed what would change if the city bought the biomass power plant to be operated by Gainesville Re-gional Utilities. The plant is owned by Gainesville Renewable Energy Center (GREC), a private entity un-
der a 30-year contract with the city 
to provide a certain quota of power through the plant.
Most residents who spoke dur-
ing public comment dissuaded the city from buying the plant, which would increase the city’s debt by millions of dollars.
Debbie Martinez, a local activist, 
cited inconsistency in GRU’s presen-tation of the biomass plant. Earlier in the process, she said, officials said buying the plant was too risky for the city’s financial health.
“Now, they’re telling us the op-
posite,” she said. “Now, all these risks have magically become ben-efits. So I’m just saying, ‘Buyer, be-ware.’”
Rob Brinkman, a 59-year-old 
Gainesville resident, spoke against the majority of public commenters and advocated for the city to buy the plant eventually.
“It would make a lot more sense 
for the city to own the plant than for GREC to own the plant — but when the time is right,” he said.
Mayor Ed Braddy said he was 
leaning toward declining the pur-chase of the plant due to uncertainty surrounding how the purchase could affect utilities rates.
“The only thing that matters 
is will purchasing the facility put downward pressure or upward pressure on rates?” he said. “If it’s just a little bit, I’d rather stick with 
the devil I know than the devil I 
don’t.”
Commissioner Randy Wells, 
however, said he’s open to discuss-ing the possibility of a deal.
“If time is of the essence, as 
GREC has indicated to us … and they feel that sitting down with us and negotiating a deal that would 
be beneficial to both parties, I would 
hope they would not pass up that opportunity,” he said.
GPD Lt. Anthony Ferrara said 
the department took noise readings at various locations and at different times of day and night near the site 
this week. Officers found the noise 
never rose to a decibel level that vio-lated the city noise ordinance.GREC plant manager Russell 
Abel said the plant has taken mea-
sures to reduce noise, smell and dust 
by hiring acoustic engineers and adjusting hours for fuel deliveries, among other things.
“We take these complaints very 
seriously and are working hard to understand the root cause of these issues,” he said.

A new ban on animal print clothing im-
posed by Chessington World of Adventures 
Resort in the U.K. is not likely to cause a roar in Gainesville.A safari-themed park located south of Cen-
tral London imposed a zero-tolerance ban on animal print clothing for visitors looking to take part in interactive experiences with the animals. Some of the prints banned include ze-bra, leopard and cheetah prints, due to claims that the patterns confuse the animals.
Jonathan Miot, the director of Santa Fe Col-
lege’s Teaching Zoo, said it’s hard to deter-
mine whether the park should be enforcing 
the rule.He said each zoo must make decisions it 
deems best for its collection. However, he said, he does not anticipate the local teaching zoo imposing such a ban anytime soon.
“I can’t remember any animals reacting 
negatively to animal print here at the zoo,” Miot said. “I have never experienced anything like that at any zoo I’ve ever worked at.”
Emily Welch, a 19-year-old UF biology 
sophomore, said it may be difficult to prove a correlation between the clothing patterns and zoo animal behavior.
“Their brains should be able to process 
size along with coloration,” she said. “Like, if you’re wearing a yellow-and-black striped 
shirt, they could tell the difference between 
you and a bee.”Zoo dress code against animal prints not likely to reach Gainesville

“It is not Sababa’s space,” he said. “That is our space used 
for our program.”
Although the center pulled the Groupon offer and television 
commercial, the ads caught the attention of the appraiser’s of-
ﬁ  ce, which started an investigation.
The appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce determined Sababa used space inside 
the center for a nonreligious purpose and reported the area should be taxed.
Under Florida law, nonproﬁ  ts, including religious institu-
tions and charities, can apply for tax exemption. One criteria requires an applicant to prove no space on a property is used 
to make money.
“It’s when the commercial aspect kicks in,” said Charles 
Bates, an attorney for the property appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce. “The stat-ute requires [Hillel] be denied an exemption.”
Feldstein said Sababa moved into the center last year to pro-
vide kosher meals for students.
“It’s a core component to our commitment to service the 
needs of the Jewish Student Body and Jewish community of the 
University of Florida,” he said.
The center rented out space in the building’s second ﬂ  oor to 
Sababa, Yegge wrote, to “ensure that those students who kept kosher were able to participate in all Hillel events and were able 
to partake in any food-related activities.”
In June, the appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce sent a notice to Hillel, stating it 
denied the center’s exemption status.
Hillel, however, petitioned the notice, saying the ofﬁ  ce vio-
lated state law by not providing a clear reason for why it denied 
the center tax exemption.  
During an August hearing, the magistrate made a recom-
mendation in favor of Hillel. Yegge wrote the ofﬁ  ce’s notice used incorrect wording and did not provide facts to describe 
the center’s ineligibility for exemption.
Bates and the appraiser’s ofﬁ  ce disagreed with the recom-
mendation and decided to appeal it to the board, which led to today’s discussion. Bates said the appraiser’s notice did say a portion of the center’s property, where Sababa is located, was 
used for nonexempt purposes.
“That’s as clear as you can get,” he said.“However, we will keep ﬁ  ghting to 
bring real change to Student Gov-ernment.”
Michael Christ, Students Party 
Murphree candidate, said as happy as he was to claim the Murphree Area seat, he was saddened for the rest of his party.
Christ won despite being issued 
a cease-and-desist order from the Elections Commission after a com-
plaint was ﬁ  led against him for 
unapproved language on his cam-paign ﬂ  iers.“This is what happens when 
only 20 percent of students vote,” he said. “Not everyone’s voice is heard.”
There was a minor hiccup in vot-
ing early Tuesday morning when computers displayed the wrong sample ballot for District D, show-ing the ballot from last Fall.
Still, a total of 6,124 votes were 
cast on the ﬁ  rst day of elections, an improvement from the ﬁ  rst day of voting in Fall 2012 with 5,860 votes but a slight drop from Spring 2013’s 
turnout of 6,274 ballots, according 
to Alligator archives.
Early Wednesday, two comput-ers in the Springs Residential Com-
plex went down due to battery is-sues. SG Information Technology quickly responded and resolved the issue.
Just before the 9:30 p.m. dead-
line, Elections Commission Chair-woman Brianne Lewis received two complaints ﬁ  led by the Students 
Party against the Swamp Party, 
both regarding campaigning on Fa-
cebook. 
These complaints, along with 
two others ﬁ  led by the Swamp Par-
ty earlier this week, will be heard at

Gainesville’s Regional Transit System 
topped a new record in the amount of riders 
on its buses in ﬁ  scal year 2013, which ended 
Monday.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner said he at-
tributes the record-breaking ridership of 10.8 
million rides during the past year to the fact 
that UF has not expanded any of its parking garages recently and because gas prices re-main high.
“Between UF and Santa Fe College, they 
comprise 77 percent of our ridership,” he said. 
“So as the student base grows, ridership is now proven to grow.”
The single-day ridership record was also 
broken. It had been set in August 2012 with 64,835 riders. But on Aug. 26 — the ﬁ  rst Mon-day of UF classes —  65,667 people took RTS 
buses.Skinner said due to this increase in rid-
ership, some of the buses have been more 
crowded.
“We have been keeping a more watchful 
eye this Fall on the number of full buses we have on particular routes,” he said. “And we are adjusting those as needed.”
Skinner said one way RTS has been com-pensating for this increase is by sending buses on unscheduled trips to pick up overﬂ  ow pas-sengers.
“If we have an available driver and an 
available bus, we will send that out there to do a mop-up duty,” he said.
Steven Saumell, 19, a Santa Fe College po-
litical science sophomore, said the record rid-
ership is possibly related to the free rides for 
SFC students.
“It’s a very convenient way to go from 
point A to point B,” he said. “Especially 
when trafﬁ  c is ridiculous and gas is insane 
these days.”

Kacie Ross said the only rea-
son she decided to walk around 
the construction site to the Reitz 
Union food court was because 
she wanted Chinese food.
The 22-year-old UF envi-
ronmental science major took 
a bite of her lunch from Panda 
Express and frowned at the mention of the construction.
“I would deﬁ  nitely rather 
eat at the Hub,” Ross said.
Aside from when she craves 
Chinese food, Ross said she tries to avoid the Reitz Union because of construction incon-venience.Some UF students are dis-
covering that it’s easier to hang out at the Hub rather than battle the blockade at the Reitz Union.
But Farrah Salem, a 20-
year-old sociology senior, dis-agreed.
Seeing longer lines and an 
increase of people in the Hub 
because of the construction, Sa-
lem said she did not mind the detour to eat at the less congest-ed Reitz Union.
“A little bit of construction 
should not impact what I eat,” Salem said.
Jill Rodriguez, marketing 
program manager for Gator Dining Services, could not con-
ﬁ  rm if the Hub is actually see-
ing more trafﬁ  c.
“While we have seen an 
increase in transactions since the P.O.D. Market opened in 
November 2012, the overall 
trafﬁ  c is very comparable with this time period last year,” she wrote in an email.
Rodriguez would not con-
ﬁ  rm whether sales at the Reitz Union have declined since con-struction.

We’ve been talking about some serious issues 
in this country lately — the government shut-down, what to do about the National Security 
Agency and how to make gun possession safer.
What we haven’t been talking about has a much 
broader scope and impact beyond our borders.
A report released Monday with more than 800 au-
thors and 50 editors from dozens of countries stated with 95 percent certainty that humans are responsible for our planet’s warming.
The group that authorized the report, the U.N. Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change, issued similar 
reports in the past. In 2007, they were 90 percent sure 
human behavior was causing climate change, but in 2001, they were only 66 percent sure.
Observations of temperature change and improved 
models have helped the IPCC illustrate humanity’s im-pact on the world with greater certainty. 
Even if carbon emissions stopped tomorrow, we 
would still feel the effects of global warming for years — even centuries — to come.
Despite clearer links to our effect on the environ-
ment, greater effects from natural disasters and melting glaciers, a March survey by the Pew Research Center found that only 69 percent of Americans thought there 
was solid evidence our planet was heating up. Even 
more disappointing —  an October 2012 survey found only 42 percent believe it is mostly because of human activity.
We don’t have time to play these political games 
anymore.
Politics are shaped by mass media. As a journalist, 
I am hyper-aware of how the media is able to frame is-sues and how that framing shapes people’s opinion. So 
let me start with this: News media must stop giving at-
tention to climate-change deniers.
Journalism is a search for the truth. In that search for the truth, it’s important to get all sides of the issue. However, most credible evidence we have 
shows we are irreversibly dam-
aging our planet. Every time an inch of column space goes to someone saying climate change 
isn’t real, a hole is poked in that 
truth and makes true evidence 
less credible.
Politicians, obviously, have an enormous say in the 
national debate. They don’t have a say in what are facts, 
though. No politician denying climate change can be 
taken seriously. If we impeached Bill Clinton for lying about Monica Lewinsky, we should do a lot more to any and every politician lying about an issue that affects lit-
erally the entire planet.
There’s an age-old saying, all the way back from el-
ementary school: Every time you point a ﬁ  nger, you’ve 
got three pointing back at you. The ultimate responsi-bility in this ﬁ  ght lies within ourselves. We are our own 
worst enemy, and we need to take responsibility.
Do the small things: Turn off the lights when you 
leave a room, don’t leave your phone charger plugged 
in and all that jazz.
Sell your car and buy a bike. Stop buying food from 
factory farms that are large contributors to carbon emis-sions. Stop supporting politicians who favor ideology over climatology.
We must hold our politicians accountable. We must 
hold the media accountable. We must hold ourselves accountable. More than any other time in history, we’re fueling our own demise, and it’s entirely stoppable.
Just remember — this is not a political issue like ev-
eryone seems to think it is. Facts are facts.

Conservative groups 
release icky ads
Just in time for Halloween, conservative group Generation 
Opportunity released a terrifying pair of video ads aimed to scare college students into opting out of Obamacare.
In the ads, a pretty, young woman — presumably a mem-
ber of the national health care exchanges — visits a gynecolo-
gist. After changing into a gown and putting her feet into the 
examination table’s stirrups, a creepy Uncle Sam stylized to look like a giant circus clown pops up between her legs, grinning like Pennywise and slowly easing a metal speculum open.
Boys, don’t think you’re off the hook either: Another ad por-
trays a young guy curled up on an examination table in a doc-tor’s ofﬁ  ce, awaiting a prostate exam, when the same monstrous Uncle Sam rises from behind the table, snapping on a rubber glove.
Just like many of our other favorite horror movies, the Gen-
eration Opportunity ads are based purely on ﬁ  ction.
Government-issued doctors won’t be giving you your next 
pelvic or prostate exam. According to The New York Times edi-torial blog, people who stay with Obamacare aren’t given access to government-run health care — just privately run insurance. And no one will be forced to undergo unwanted examinations, as purported by the ads.
“Signing up for an exchange isn’t an act of political (or sexu-
al) submission,” Juliet Lapidos wrote in the blog post. “It’s just a way to get insurance if you don’t have a job or your employer doesn’t provide it.”
PolitiFact conﬁ  rmed on Sept. 15 that doctors won’t be forced 
to ask intrusive questions about patients’ sex lives under the Af-fordable Care Act either, after a New York Post article claimed otherwise.
“[Obamacare] doesn’t require any ‘sex questions’ — except 
for whether you’re male or female. You might hear the words, 
‘Are you sexually active?’ from your doctor, but it wouldn’t have 
anything to do with the health care law,” PolitiFact stated.
So Generation Opportunity, with its perfectly vague name 
and genuinely offensive meme-laden website, is perpetuating some serious lies about what Obamacare will entail for young people.
According to Yahoo News, Generation Opportunity is pour-
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars into convincing college students to opt out of Obamacare, even though those who don’t 
sign up by 2014 will be required to pay either a $95 ﬁ  ne or 1 
percent of their household income through the Internal Revenue Service.
The organization plans to travel to colleges around the coun-
try and encourage students to sign pledges to opt out of Obama-care by posting up at tailgates to hand out pizza and branded beer koozies.
Whether you take advantage of Obamacare or not is your 
choice, but Generation Opportunity’s scare tactics and lies are 
unacceptable. 
Rest assured that a creepy Uncle Sam will not, as the ads 
would have you believe, be making a guest appearance at your 
next doctor’s visit.

The jolly banjo-strumming gen-
tlemen who graced Florida with a 
festival in September are taking a break from music.
Mumford & Sons, a Grammy 
Award-winning folk rock band, announced its indeﬁ  nite hiatus through Rolling Stone after its last concert stop in Bonner Springs, Kan., promoting reigning Album of the Year, “Babel.”
“We just know 
we’re going to take a consider-
able amount of 
time off and just go back to hang-ing out and hav-ing no commit-
ments or pressure or anything like that,” keyboardist Ben Lovett told Rolling Stone. “It feels like the last week of school right now.”
It seems the four Brits are tired 
from nonstop touring after the suc-cess of their ﬁ  rst album, “Sigh No More,” in 2009. It has since been a haze of string lights, staples of their concerts, until their Gentlemen of the Road Stopovers this summer.
Longtime fan Jordyn Schwersky, 
a 21-year-old UF journalism senior, 
was at the tour’s stop in St. Augus-
tine on Sept. 14. She heard about the hiatus a week after seeing them per-form live.
“My ﬁ  rst reaction was over-
whelming relief that I went to the show, because this is the ﬁ  rst time they had been to Florida, so I jumped on that immediately,” she said.
Schwersky has been a fan since 
2010 and recalls a month of her freshman year at college spent lis-tening solely to Mumford.
“If they don’t get back together 
I’m just going to sit in a corner and cry for the rest of my life,” Schwer-sky said. “It would be devastating.”She hopes the break will bring 
in a new perspective to their music and a different sound from their two very similar albums.
Fan Alex Sanchez also hopes the 
break will make the band step back and bring a new sound to the table.
“I think the best work produced by artists is produced when they are not in the public eye, so I think it’ll be interesting to see that,” said Sanchez, a 21-year-old UF journal-ism junior.
The band hinted at the introduc-
tion of rap into their next album in 
an interview with Rolling Stone in February. That’s a far cry from ban-
jos and keyboards.
“If rap comes out, I’m gonna be 
a fan,” Sanchez said. “I’m all about that.”
For now, though, we will have to 
wait.
A tumultuous year for bassist Ted Dwane may be behind the rea-soning for the hiatus. The band had to cancel three shows after Dwane underwent brain surgery to remove a blood clot.
“We deﬁ  nitely want a little 
break,” Dwane told Rolling Stone. 
“We’re going to have a little rest.”
� GOOGLE HAS A NEW LOGO.

Personally, I like things to have 
some depth. I will always prefer 
John Green to Ryan Lochte and a deep ocean to a kiddie pool.
But apparently, tech companies 
like Google and Apple disagree. They are moving toward aesthetics that lack dimension. On Sept. 19, Google introduced a new logo. You may not have noticed it because the difference is subtle, but the colors are slightly muted, and the letters are ﬂ  atter.
This is the ﬁ  rst time the company 
has revamped its logo since 2010, when its colors were brightened and some of its shading was removed.
The recent update to the logo is 
joined with a redesign to Google’s navigation bar. Instead of the black bar, Google has reorganized its plat-forms onto the same grid that is seen on the Android.
In Google’s ofﬁ  cial blog, the com-
pany said, “We’ll be rolling out this update across most Google products over the next few weeks, so keep an eye out and let us know your thoughts.”
My thought 
is the look of Google’s new logo is similar to that of Apple’s new iP-
hone. The iOS 7 
software upgrade, which came out 
Sept. 18, launched shockingly differ-ent apps that sport less of a 3-D ef-fect and a more basic color scheme. The design is playful — almost like it came from a child’s sketchbook.This movement toward more 
modern and simple shapes and tones seems to have inﬂ  uenced both companies’ design choices. Howev-er, not everyone is accepting of this direction.
UF biology freshman Giovanna 
Sutherland, 18, said she liked the old 
Google logo better. She favored its 
shading and deeper colors.
Some people don’t see the differ-
ence to Google’s search page.
UF horticultural science junior 
Darius Warner, 20, said he remem-bers someone telling him that the company changed its logo, but it looks the same to him.
“Large news is being made about 
something insigniﬁ  cant,” he said. “I think it is a little pointless — sort of a publicity stunt.”
UF social media specialist Bruce 
Floyd said companies only change their logos slightly so they will still 
be recognized and associated with 
their brands.
Google is doing just that.As Fast Company wrote, “Google 
is now imbuing everything it does with the sort of effortless panache that the tech world once associated only with Apple.”Mumford & Sons ﬁ  nishes tour, announces hiatus

If Joni Mitchell had a syn-
thesizer, she could easily be the 
fourth sister of Haim.
The highly anticipated de-
but album “Days are Gone” 
dropped Monday, and the 
three California Haim sisters live up to the hype.
“Days are Gone” presents 
songs of falling in love, dealing with relationships and eventu-ally letting go, in an edgy “I’m going to ombre my hair and only wear leather vests” kind 
of way.
Heavy on the drums and 
vocal harmonies, Danielle, Al-
ana and Este Haim are a mix between Destiny’s Child and Fleetwood Mac.
But the three twenty-some-
things aren’t new to the mu-sic scene — having been in a 
family band with their parents 
for years. Danielle Haim has played the drums on Jenny Lewis’ tour and guitar for the Strokes frontman, Julian Casa-blancas. Together, Haim has opened for Mumford & Sons and played Lollapalooza and the 2013 Glastonbury Festival.
The pop rock, indie trio are 
all multi-instrumentalists who sing and write their own ma-terial. And do it all with great hair — some people have it all.
“Days are Gone” is a full-
length album, including their three songs — “Forever,” “Fall-ing” and “Go Slow” — from 2012 EP “Forever.”
The album has a very dis-
tinctive formula: repetitive drum beats plus catchy cho-ruses, a recurring theme in each 
song.
Haim’s strength isn’t in its 
vocals, though its harmonies 
make it sound easy. The sisters have a clear gimmick: reimag-ining the classics and drawing on inspirations to create their unique sound. You can hear Joni Mitchell in “Honey & I,” a 
little early Vampire Weekend in 
“Forever” and some TLC in the sassy girl power anthem “My Song 5.” Still, they’ve managed to keep the album cohesive.
As far as lyrics go, “The 
Wire” is the strongest song on the album. With a verse saying, “I’d give it all away just to hear 
you say that /Well I know, I 
know, I know I know that you’re gonna be OK anyway,” this song puts every Taylor Swift breakup song to shame.
Halfway through the album, 
the easy-going, raw sound switches to a more auto-tuned ‘90s vibe with “Days are Gone” 
and “My Song 5.” Though the 
two songs are potential hits in the making, they also feel a lit-
tle out of place compared to the 
rest of the tracks.
If this is what their ﬁ  rst al-
bum sounds like, I am excited 
to see what comes next.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2013

1. Portion control.
I recommend using food scales and measuring cups to gauge how much you’re truly eating, at least when you are 
ﬁ  rst learning to control your portions. You will be able to eyeball it in no time. A Health Magazine article elaborated:  
“a 2004 study of 329 overweight people found that 38% of those who practiced portion control for two years lost 5% or more of body weight, compared with 33% of participants who did not (they gained 5% or more of body weight).”
2. Prepare your meal in advance.
(To learn more on how and why to meal prep, see my blog post at livlangandprosper.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/
weekly-meal-prep/)
Mass cooking your meals like an Iron Chef for three to four days will save you not only time but also calories. While 
you’re waiting on the load of weeks of accumulated laundry to dry, why not mass cook your meals and portion them out in Tupperware containers? They’ll be ready to grab and go for class, leaving you less likely to make an unhealthy, hunger-induced fast-food decision.
3. Plan. Timing is everything.
I recommend eating every three to four hours. As long as you eat small-portioned meals, this will keep your me-
tabolism burning like a furnace, maintain stable energy levels and control appetite. A meal doesn’t mean a nacho plate from Moe’s. For example, an apple with a large handful of almonds and a hard-boiled egg is a great meal be-tween a substantial breakfast and lunch.Hand GuideApproximate

When Stephanie Hardy first 
watched “The Fox,” she wasn’t 
expecting to see costumed adults dancing and making animal sounds in dark woods.  
“The most appealing thing 
about it is definitely the surprise factor,” she said about the viral video by the Norwegian comedy duo, Ylvis.
The 19-year-old mechanical and 
aerospace engineering sophomore said “The Fox (What does the Fox say?)” video was a beautiful thing, and it gained popularity for be-ing so catchy people couldn’t look away.
“What Does the Fox Say?” is not 
only a hilariously bizarre observa-tion of common animal sounds, but also a perfect example of the ludicrous taste of the American public. Following in the footsteps of last year’s fall hit, “Thrift Shop” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, “What Does the Fox say?” capti-vates audiences by being uncon-ventional but inescapably memo-rable.  
The duo’s goal was to make an 
unsuccessful video to use as the opening joke for the premiere of their Norwegian talk show’s third season, brothers Bard and Vegard said on “The El-len Degeneres Show.”
Ylvis wanted 
to give the pro-
ducers of the video what the duo called a “crap idea.” As they ob-served later on “Ellen,” their plan backfired. The video, released on YouTube on Sept. 3, now has more than 75 million views. Reactions to this strange video have been on both extremes — some students love it, and others hate it.
“The fox doesn’t say anything,” 
said Juliana Schmidt, a 19-year-old nursing sophomore, denouncing the video as nonsensical.
“I think it’s popular because it’s 
just so out there, and people think it’s funny. I mean, why did ‘Friday’ by Rebecca Black get so popular?”

Following suit (and tie — I 
couldn’t resist) with this year’s 
earlier release, Justin Timberlake’s 
“The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2” is just that — a split-sided LP that’s half dark, pulsating club beats 
and half smooth, sweet tracks. But 
words don’t really do the duality 
justice — only a thorough listen will truly give you the full “experi-ence.”
The album immediately kicks in 
with the gritty, nasty “Gimme What I Don’t Know (I Want).” This track basically sets the tone for the entire first half of the record with the beat 
down low and a super-sexy sound. 
As an added bonus, JT’s lower 
register cascades over the chorus 
with a somewhat mystical-sound-ing background. 
The song segues into “True 
Blood” (anyone else betting the HBO show of the same title takes notice for next season?), with pro-ducer/collaborator Timbaland’s deep voice booming next to Tim-berlake’s chest-based rumble. 
Already, the dance vibe on this 
album is so club-friendly you can just imagine the low lights and tight spaces.
Although there aren’t a lot of 
guest appearances on the record, Drake shows up on the lively “Cabaret,” and Jay-Z returns for 
his second round on “Murder.” But 
there really isn’t need for a ton of collaborators. 
Tracks like “TKO” (comparable 
in some aspects to Part 1’s “Tun-
nel Vision”) are elaborate enough 
without any additional voices.
Not including current single 
(’70s pop-sounding “Take Back the Night”), the album moves into soft-
er territory with the guitar-oriented 
“Drink You Away” and slinky “You Got It On.” 
Again, like Part 1’s latter half, 
“Amnesia” has an epic essence 
about it a la “Mirrors.” 
The darker “Only When I Walk 
Away” transitions nicely into the 
last song, the slow ballad “Not a 
Bad Thing.” 
For some, the slightly twangy 
sound might sound a bit country at 
some points.
That’s the cool thing about Jus-
tin Timberlake — he can go from 
dance tracks to a mellow, guitar-
picking love song, and still make them all sound inherently great.
The album is a mix of genres, 
but it is not mixed enough to be completely incoherent. “The 20/20 Experience — 2 of 2” is a further af-firmation that 2013 (and, for many, contemporary music) is truly in Timberlake’s court.‘The 20/20 Experience

Foam might be the future of footwear 
fashion. Two environmental experts at UF 
are optimistic about a shoe design that would be made from biodegradable, or recyclable foam, materials.
UNifold, a shoe designed by 23-year-old 
Horatio Yuxin Han, emerged from a chal-lenge by his Pratt Institute professor to cre-ate a printable footwear design, according an article from The Daily Beast.  
Han’s design is printed on one piece of 
eco-friendly foam material, cut out and fold-ed into either a closed-toed flat or a sandal, 
according to the story. 
The shoe is still in a prototype stage, but companies have shown interest in buying the 
experimental design.
Dale Morris, UF recycling and solid waste 
coordinator, said its health benefit the shoes could bring is the most important feature.
While he said the health benefits are the 
priority for the potential Third World users, the eco-friendly aspect can benefit the rest of the world.
“As a society, we all look to prevent any-
thing that’s going to have an environmental impact,” he said. “It’s really a win-win situ-ation.”
It has not been determined if the shoe 
will be recyclable or biodegradable because 
a material for production has not yet been 
chosen.
Morris said the two would yield differ-ent results if they were to hit the market. A 100-percent recyclable shoe would only be ef-fective if the wearers have a way to collect the 
shoes and recycle them.
If they were biodegradable, the shoes 
could potentially break down naturally with-
out the need for an entire recycling system.  
Matt Williams, director 
of the UF Office of Sustain-ability, said the effective-ness of a biodegradable shoe depends on what it 
would break down into. 
If the users have a way 
to repeatedly recycle the 
shoes, then using a recyclable material might 
be the best solution, he said.
Seaton Tarrant, a UF political science doc-
toral student said it’s difficult to determine concrete rules on what sustainability means.
“You have to look at it as part of a bigger system.”
Tarrant said recyclable shoes would thrive 
more in a consumer culture, like the U.S., 
where people are used to throwing away 
shoes. He said he questions if recyclable shoes are appropriate for other cultures.
“You want to build shoes that are as dura-
ble and lasting as they can be,” he said. “Why not get one pair that will last you 40 years?”
Williams said more than the possible en-
vironmental effects, the shoes ultimately pro-vide a way to bring footwear manufacturing 
back into the U.S.
According to the article, making the shoes 
would not require heavy machinery and 
only needs a single sheet of foam rubber to create, so there is less need to outsource the manufacturing. Instead, manufacturing can be done in the U.S.
“There is a real value in terms of job cre-
ation,” Williams said. Shoe design gives new life back to old materials

It’s dusk. The sun’s orange glow barely 
peeks over the bogs of the Everglades as 
Naomi Fisher adjusts her camera.   
For the past two days, she has traveled to 
the swamps of the Anhinga Trail, and for a 
third time, she is here to film alligators bend 
their bodies into a yoga pose, half-submerged in muddy marsh water. Through her lens, she watches the water around the gators tremble as they throat a deep growl. The sound etches shapes and patterns into the water’s surface, and the rumble is so loud it vibrates her chest like the bass in a car stereo system.  
This was one of many interactions that 
Fisher witnessed while working on her most recent project, “Lay of the Land.” She has come full circle as her work will be displayed Friday in UF’s University Gallery through Nov. 15, among Gators once again.
A professional artist from Miami, Fisher 
has been exhibiting art nationally and inter-nationally since 1999. Nature has been a part of her consciousness since she was a child 
— traveling with her father, who is a tropi-
cal botanist, and collecting plants. One of her father’s closest friends was a botanical illus-trator who noticed Fisher loved to draw and encouraged her to keep doing it.
“I feel really fortunate to have had her as a 
role model growing up, but that also allowed me to enter art through a path that involved nature,” Fisher said.
Since then, her photography, paintings 
and video have been displayed all over the world, in countries like Germany, Italy and Ukraine.
But now, in the University Gallery, she is 
displaying photography and video she took while spending a month in the Everglades.After exploring specific locations in the 
marshes, sometimes alone, Fisher said, “I did a lot of hiking, just wandering around with my camera and video camera.”
In the video, ashes cover the ground in an 
area that used to be farmland called Hole-in-the-Donut, deep inside the Everglades, Fisher 
said. Before a controlled burn turned thriving 
plants to soot, a group of people brought soil and fertilizer into the swamp to cultivate the land for agriculture. This completely changed the ecology after invasive species started to grow out of seeds that were in the soil, push-ing native plants out.
Everglades workers are fixing the prob-
lem by “pulling out every single plant there 
— even the good ones — pulling out all of the 
soil and sweeping the dirt out until there is nothing but bedrock,” Fisher said. Then they set it on fire.
What she realized was how extreme trans-
formation happens in nature, which became the central theme for the video.
“It’s so interesting how things can shift 
from one day to the next, even if you’re on 
the same trail,” she said.
That video will be projected inside the 
University Gallery and will accompany her 
photography and Native American artifacts borrowed from the Florida Museum of Natu-ral History.
Director of University Galleries Amy Vig-
ilante said she is excited to display Fisher’s work at UF.
“I love it. I saw one of her videos at the 
Vizcaya in Miami, and it was fantastic,” Vigilante said. “Digital media is very in right now, so this is a really current show.”
Twenty-one-year-old UF sculpture senior 
Marla Rosen said art students around cam-pus are also excited to see Fisher’s exhibition because she’s a successful artist who works interdisciplinarily, which means she doesn’t focus on one medium in a show.
Rosen interned with Fisher two summers 
ago in Miami and helped set up “Lay of the Land” in the University Gallery.
“Creating a large-scale installation is a 
very interesting way of working,” Rosen 
said, and being interdisciplinary is “a way of 
working that a lot of artists are moving to-ward.”During the opening reception Friday, 
Fisher hopes the exhibition engages the audi-ence and compels them to ask questions. The theme of the show is a part of her ongoing investigation into how humans deal with na-ture.
“For me, it’s taking this sort of extreme 
transformation that happened in nature … and thinking about that in terms of changes in your own life,” Fisher said.

about the Original family’s 
backstory and history in New Orleans,” Davis said. “But 
I’m definitely 
not looking 
forward to the plot twist about Klaus and Hayley’s 
baby.”
The spin-off aired a pi-
lot episode in April, but the 
episode has been completely reworked for tonight’s series 
premiere.
The new version focuses 
on why Elijah, not Klaus, 
returns to New Orleans – a 
move that will allow people 
who have never seen an epi-sode of “The Vampire Dia-ries” to watch the spin-off 
without being confused.
But if you’re still skepti-
cal about the immortality of the vampire craze, there is a second new vampire show in 
the fall lineup. Jonathan Rhys Meyers will star in NBC’s upcoming series “Dracula,” 
premiering Oct. 25.
“As long as shows like 
‘TVD’, ‘The Originals’ and 
‘Dracula’ are around, they will keep the vampire trend 
alive. Each vampire show has 
its own spin on vampirism, so there is enough diversity to keep them popular,” Davis 
said.
The end doesn’t seem near 
for “The Vampire Diaries” or 
its star, Ian Somerhalder.
In 2010, the actor launched 
the Ian Somerhalder Foun-dation, which aims to em-power young adults to take a stand on global issues and 
to become a force for positive 
change.
If students would like to 
get involved in the Ian Somer-halder Foundation College 
Division, Davis advises them 
to visit isfoundation.com/college and to follow the organization on Facebook, 
Twitter and Instagram by 
searching for ISF College.Television shows about

Dear Friend,
Be a ghost. The best way to execute this 
is not by wearing a white sheet with two eye-
holes. Go to the local public transit and ask 
people for money. Tell them you have a baby 
to feed and you’re not sure where you’re going to sleep tonight. You’d be surprised how little 
your existence is acknowledged.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What day is it?Dear Mediocre Advice,
What should I be for 
Halloween this year? Dear Friend,
It’s Oct. 3.
Dear Friend,
Gainesville is the wrong town to expect people to not know who 
you are, where you work and who you’ve boned. You don’t need as many friends as you think you do. Just imagine having a bunch of 
d**khead friends who kind of suck if you hang out with them for too 
long. Maybe something worse could happen — they’d turn into real friends, and you’d be stuck with more people who know too much about you! Boo-hoo. Just hang out with the people you like and don’t 
overthink these weird, mythical extras you want in your life.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’ve been in Gainesville for about two years 
now, and I am still having trouble finding a good group of friends. I have a few close friends, but 
sometimes I don’t want someone who knows me 
so extremely up close and personal. Help?TV blood suckers peakart THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2013

Donovan speaks on injury 
While speaking at the Jimmy V. Classic Gala, UF 
coach Billy Donovan said forward Will Yeguete (knee) has not been cleared to practice.Can Maryland upset Florida State on Saturday? Adam Pincus and Landon Watnick debate on page 16.PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
Arkansas running back Alex Collins 
has started his college career so impres-
sively that even he is surprised.
Collins, a freshman from Fort Lau-
derdale, became the first Southeastern Conference running back to amass at least 100 rushing yards in each of his 
first three college games earlier this 
season. Adrian Peterson was the last tailback from any conference to accom-plish the feat, doing so while playing at Oklahoma in 2004.
“I have surprised myself,” Collins 
told Arkansas reporters last week. “I don’t make or set goals of having this amount of yards. I just come to play 
and do whatever my coach needs me to 
do and just try and do it to perfection.”
Collins has come close to perfec-
tion.
The 5-foot-11, 206-pounder totaled 
his fourth 100-yard game of the season by accumulating 116 yards on 14 car-ries during his SEC debut, a 45-33 loss to Texas A&M on Saturday. 
Through four games, Collins is sec-
ond in the conference behind South Carolina running back Mike Davis with 119.4 rushing yards per game. Collins  and change-of-pace tailback Jonathan Williams have spearheaded an Arkan-
sas ground game that ranks second in 
the SEC, averaging 237 rushing yards per game. 
“He’s a complete back,” defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “His numbers speak for themselves what he’s been able to do already this year. He’s a big challenge.”
Collins will be in for his biggest 
challenge of the season when facing the No. 18 Gators on Saturday at 7 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
Florida boasts the nation’s best 
rushing defense, holding opponents to a meager 53.5 yards on the ground per game. 
Only one of the four defenses — No. 
4 Rutgers — Collins has faced to start the season has ranked  higher than 80th in the country in rushing defense. 
“He is an outstanding player,” coach 
Will Muschamp said. “Alex is second in our league in rushing. That tells you a lot about his maturity and being able to step in and contribute that quickly.”Added defensive tackle Damien Ja-
cobs: “They going to line up there and run it there, and they going to run it un-til you stop them. We’ve got to step it up this week. It’s going to be fun.” 
Much like Miami running back Duke 
Johnson — who Florida limited to just 59 yards on 21 carries during the Hur-ricane’s 21-16 win against the Gators on Sept. 7 — Collins spurned Muschamp 
and the Gators for an opportunity to 
play elsewhere. 
During his final two seasons at 
South Plantation High, Collins rushed 
for 3,186 yards and 42 touchdowns. 
Rivals.com rated him a four-star pros-pect and the No. 13 running back in the Class of 2013. 
However, with Kelvin Taylor and 
Adam Lane already planning to attend Florida, Collins committed to Miami before finally signing with Arkansas, instantly becoming first-year coach 
Bret Bielema’s biggest catch in his de-
but recruiting class.
Florida was never a serious destina-
tion for one of the state’s top-ranked high school players. 
“There are so many good players in 
our state, you can’t sign them all,” Mus-champ said. “He’s a heck of a football player, but he’s a great young man.”

Freshman running back to test Gators
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan                     
Linebacker Michael Taylor wears his heart on 
his sleeve.
One of his sleeves read, “4 U 2 Nana,” during 
Florida’s 24-7 victory against Kentucky on Satur-
day night at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexing-ton, Ky. He was honoring his late grandmother and injured teammates Dominique Easley and 
Andre Debose.
“My grandma passed last year so I always ded-
icate something on my body to her every game,” 
Taylor said. “I usually try to put my fallen soldiers on me somewhere.”
Taylor made his three 
soldiers proud against the Wildcats, recording eight tackles, including one for 
loss in the victory. The performance upped his tackle total to 20, which is tied for second among Gators.
Taylor credited his success to better under-
standing Florida’s defensive system.
“When the opportunity arises, you’ve got to 
take advantage of it,” Taylor said. “So every op-portunity I get, I’m just going to take advantage of it.”
Taylor has made his coaches proud, too.Florida promoted Taylor to co-starter status at 
both Mike and Will linebacker in this week’s depth chart. Last week’s release listed him as the backup at Mike behind sophomore Antonio Morrison.
“Mike plays with a certain style, a style that we 
like, that we embrace on defense,” defensive coor-dinator D.J. Durkin said. “He epitomizes what we want to be. He’s a tough, physical guy. He plays 
really hard. And I think you’ve seen that on the 
field.”
More playing time means more chances for 
Taylor to talk, but not just through his play or on his sleeves. Taylor is on the field to make plays, 
and he lets the opposition know.
“You guys couldn’t handle that so I can’t really 
say that in here,” Taylor said when asked what 
he says to the other team. “If y’all mic me up, you 
might find out.”
Freshman impressing opposition: Freshman 
cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III is on Arkansas 
coach Bret Bielema’s radar.
“He’s everything you want in the position,” 
Bielema said during Wednesday’s SEC Coaches Media Teleconference. “He’s very confident, very aggressive.”
Hargreaves was named the Southeastern Con-
ference Freshman of the Week on Monday after Taylor enjoying 
role increase for  Florida defense 
“He’s a heck of a football 
player, but he’s a great young 
man.”

16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2013
Freshman cornerback proving critical to success of UF secondary 
he recorded his third interception in Florida’s 24-7 win 
against Kentucky at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexing-ton, Ky. Hargreaves has also recorded seven tackles and 
his four pass breakups are tied with Jabari Gorman for the 
team lead.
“He responds really well,” defensive coordinator D.J. 
Durkin said of Hargreaves. “The stage is not too big for 
him. He goes out there and handles his business.”The emergence of Hargreaves has 
helped Florida’s secondary thrive de-
spite the absence of Marcus Roberson (sprained knee) and Loucheiz Purifoy’s 
struggles to achieve consistency. How 
Hargreaves carries himself off the ﬁ  eld despite his early success has impressed 
Durkin as well as fellow defensive back Jaylen Watkins.
“He’s a very humble kid,” Watkins said of Hargreaves. 
“He’s one of the most humble people I’ve ever met.”Linebacker hates bears: Taylor was happy he did not 
receive an invitation to offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s pregame nature walk with Florida’s quarterbacks on Satur-day in Lexington, Ky.
“We ain’t taking no risk of running into any bears,” Tay-
lor said of Florida’s defense. “We’re good.”
Taylor is keen on avoiding bears. Sharing the same side 
of the ball with defensive tackle Darious “Bear” Cummings is good enough for him.
“I wouldn’t have went on a nature walk somewhere I 
don’t know,” Taylor said.NOTES , from page 15THE RALLY
Each week, two alligatorSports columnists 
will debate the biggest looming matchup in college football. Today, Adam Pincus 
and Landon Watnick preview No. 8 Florida State’s home matchup against No. 25 Maryland in Tallahassee on Saturday at noon on ESPN.
Adam: Florida State, a 16-point favorite, 
will continue its dominance against a Mary-
land team not quite yet ready to hang with 
the nation’s elite in another beatdown at Doak 
Campbell Stadium. 
The Seminoles have won 21 of 23 in this se-
ries and all 11 games played in Tallahassee. 
Although third-year coach Randy Edsall 
has done an admirable job through the ﬁ  rst month of this season, his team will get a rude awakening come Saturday. There’s just too much ﬁ  repower from the Seminoles. 
For every playmaker the Terrapins have, 
the Seminoles have three to match. If this were on the basketball court, I’d give Maryland a chance. Unfortunately for the school just a subway ride away from Washington, D.C., the Seminoles will shut down the Terrapins and further their quest for an elusive Atlantic Coast Conference title. 
Landon: Unlike our government, Mary-
land might actually be good this year.
The 4-0 Terrapins are off to their best start 
since 2001 and have already equaled their win total from last season. In his third year on the job, Edsall has turned the ship around. What was once a dumpster ﬁ  re is now one of the FBS’s biggest sur-prises.
Maryland might 
have played two cupcakes in FIU 
and Old Dominion 
to kick off 2013, but it clobbered West Virginia 37-0 on Sept. 21 for its ﬁ  rst shutout in ﬁ  ve years. Don’t forget, WVU knocked off then-No. 11 Oklahoma State 30-21 last weekend.
The Seminoles always seems to lose to 
some unranked ACC opponent and kill its national title hopes early. Florida State lost to Wake Forest in 2011 and North Carolina State in 2010 and 2012 during the ﬁ  rst two months of the season.).
The Terrapins are coming off a bye week 
and should be ripe to pull off the road upset.
Adam: Have you seen Jameis Winston this 
year? The kid is the real deal.
E.J. Manuel, the turnover machine, never 
got Florida State over the hump. That should change this season with a dynamic rushing at-tack and efﬁ  cient pass offense.
Sure, FSU almost ruined its season against 
Steve Addazio’s Boston College to the chagrin of Florida fans everywhere. 
As an aside, what’s better: Florida State 
with an embarrassing loss or Addazio win-
ning? If the Gators continue to win, Addazio’s 
legacy in Gainesville will be the dive play and Tyler Murphy.As Florida still 
ﬁ  nds itself offen-sively, Florida State knows who it is — a ﬁ  ne-tuned machine 
with a dual-threat 
quarterback at the helm.
Winston aver-
ages 262 yards and 
three touchdowns a game in his ﬁ  rst season as starter. The running back combination of Devonta Freeman, Karlos Williams and James Wilder Jr. gives FSU nearly 180 yards on the 
ground a game. Take this stat: The Seminoles 
are second in the FBS to Baylor with 8.6 yards per play and  have 18 touchdown drives that have been three minutes or less. These guys score and score often. Maryland has to get to at least 40 and I just don’t see it.
Landon: Winston has been spectacular so 
far this year, but Maryland signal-caller C.J. Brown has fallen under the radar a bit and also 
deserves some attention.
After missing last season with a torn ACL, 
Brown has started off 2013 on a tear. Through 
four games, he has 13 touchdowns (seven passing and six rushing) to only one intercep-tion. On top of that, he averages 260.8 passing yards per game.
Winston may be better than Brown, but it 
isn’t a far cry to say that Brown is one of the  
most dynamic quarterbacks in the ACC.
Adam: I like to deal in certainties. You 
started off by saying “Maryland might actu-ally be good this year.” 
Here’s what we know about them: Mary-
land is an up-and-coming football team who 
knocked off West Virginia. That’s all we know. There isn’t much we know about Florida State, 
except that this is a talented squad with Mary-
land in its rear-view mirror. 
You can’t tell me the Terrapins have more 
talent, and if so get off that angel dust. 
Nothing you say about Maryland’s defense 
could hide this fact. In just the ﬁ  fth game of 2013, I’m taking the more talented team in this game. Jimbo Fisher will have his boys ready. The always aptly-dressed Terrapins’ claim to 
fame won’t be what it does on the ﬁ  eld just 
yet.
Landon: Honestly, I’m not certain how ei-
ther team will fare as the season progresses. But I am certain that Maryland’s defense is re-ally good.
The Terrapins are third in the conference 
in turnover margin at plus-5 after forcing six against West Virginia. Maryland’s 17 sacks are 
tied for the nation’s best count, and its eight 
picks are tied for eighth most in the country.
In addition, the Terrapins are third in the 
country in scoring defense, allowing only 10.3 points per game. That’s fewer points allowed than Florida (12.8). To put it in greater per-spective, both Maryland and UF have faced comparable competition ﬁ  ve weeks into the season. 
Maryland’s defense isn’t pansy by any 
means. This team will give FSU problems Sat-urday.
Who will win the Florida State-Maryland matchup on Saturday?
