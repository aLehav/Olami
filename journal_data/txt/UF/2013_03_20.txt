Incumbent Randy Wells won 
re-election in the City Com-
mission District 4 race Tuesday night, but incumbent Mayor Craig Lowe and contender Ed Braddy will compete next month in a runoff election for Gainesville mayor.
This year’s city elections saw 
12,215 voters or 14.92 percent of the city’s registered voters, cast ballots, according to the Super-visor of Elections’ Ofﬁ  ce site.
In the mayoral election, 
Braddy garnered 4,636 votes — 38.43 percent — while Lowe col-lected 4,406 votes, or 36.52 per-cent. Because neither candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election between the two will be April 16.
Braddy said he was proud 
of his campaign leading up to Tuesday’s election.
“If we keep things together,” 
he said, “we’ll be in a good spot for April 16.”
Lowe said he is looking for-
ward to the runoff race as well. It was inevitable, he said, and the weeks leading up to Tues-day’s race were helpful in deﬁ  n-ing key issues.
“This is what I expected with 
this many candidates in the race,” he said. “The people of Gainesville have … two distinct viewpoints as to how Gainesville should move forward.”
Scherwin L. Henry received 
2,058 votes, or 17.06 percent; Pete Johnson gathered 783 votes, or 6.49 percent; Donald Shepherd Sr. collected 53 votes; and Mark Venzke received 128 votes.
Mayoral candidate Mark 
Venzke said he was dissatisﬁ  ed with the number of votes he re-ceived. Venzke said some voters who believed in him as a candi-date voted for Braddy instead, adding that he believed Braddy was considered a more viable contender against Lowe.
“I’m guessing that was what was on the minds of a lot of vot-ers,” Venzke said.
Voters also struck down a 
proposed city charter amend-ment that would place munici-pal elections every other year during odd-numbered years and extend commissioner and mayoral terms to four years in-stead of three. Out of the 11,424 votes cast on the charter, 56.36 percent voted “No.”  
Meanwhile, in the District 
4 City Commission race, Wells received a majority of the votes with 1,115 votes, or 53.63 per-cent. Alfredo Espinosa gathered 545 votes. W.E. “Mac” McEach-ern collected 419.
Wells said he plans to take 
“a little bit of a break” until he starts his term again as commis-sioner.
“I look forward to continu-
ing to serve this community,” he said.
Espinosa said he was grate-
ful for the turnout and support from his UF classmates.
“I’m so happy, because for 
the ﬁ  rst time, the student body got together and backed a stu-dent candidate like never be-fore,” he said.

Wearing sunglasses may save people 
about $100 the next time they are on a 
scooter.
If motorcycles or scooters are capa-
ble of traveling more than 30 mph, the driver must wear goggles, face shields or glasses to protect their eyes. Contact lenses do not qualify, according to Uni-versity Police.
UPD Lt. Greg Streukens said ﬁ  ve 
citations were given out last semester. This semester, ﬁ  ve citations have been given, not including warnings. The tick-ets cost $104.
“Every year, there seems like there 
is more and more scooters on campus, which might be why more people have been stopped,” Streukens said.
He said he believes riders don’t un-
derstand that once the scooter goes fast-er than 30 mph, or has an engine of more than 50 cubic centimeters, it is consid-ered a motorcycle and must abide by the same rules, which include a motorcycle endorsement and eye protection.
“The problem is ... that they are mak-
ing these scooters that are 50 cc or less, but they can go greater than 30 mph,” Streukens said. “Not only that, but if you buy the same scooter as the guy next to you, and he’s not wearing sunglasses, then you assume you don’t have to.”
Julia DiCesare said she was riding 
her scooter in the parking garage next to Norman Hall when she was pulled over by a UPD ofﬁ  cer for not wearing protec-tive eyewear.
“I was unaware of the law,” the 
19-year-old UF psychology and market-ing sophomore said. “Many others were ticketed or warned within the same time span, but the cop was really nice and just informed me [of the law] instead of giving me a ticket.”Avoid tickets

STATE
KATIE BURNS

Despite the events at the University 
of Central Florida and other universities 
around the nation, Florida does not have legislation on the ﬂ  oor to change its laws for concealed weapons on campuses.
Last week, Florida Senate President Don 
Gaetz (R-Niceville) said in a news confer-ence he wouldn’t hinder Senate committees from discussing controversial legislation such as gun control.
However, he said he would not vote for 
any of the bills seeking to restrict or regulate gun ownership. He said his idea of gun control is a “steady aim.”
However, Arkansas 
pulled the trigger on the debate of concealed carry on college campuses at the end of February. The state legislature passed a bill to allow colleges and 
universities to decide whether to allow con-cealed weapons on their campuses.
Arkansas will join 23 other states that 
allow individual colleges or universities to decide whether to ban concealed carry of weapons on campus, according to the Na-tional Conference of state Legislatures.
UF history senior Erin Gallagher does 
not think Arkansas’ initiative is enough. The initiative would allow colleges to opt in for concealed carry for faculty and staff. Gallagher said she believes the same right should be extended to students.
“It is a matter of security in an otherwise 
virtually unprotected area, but more impor-tantly, of guarding our constitutional right to take care of ourselves,” the 22-year-old said.

If you enjoyed alcoholic beverages last 
weekend, you may have been indulging in the 
same behavior as primates — giving a whole new meaning to “monkeying around.”
According to a recent study performed by 
chemist Steven Benner of the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Gainesville, alcohol-metabolizing enzymes first appeared in extinct primates about 10 million years ago.“There’s a time when you are learning to 
walk on the ground, and at that same time, your enzymes were learning how to break down alcohol,” he said.
Benner and his colleagues resurrected pro-
teins from rebuilding the digestive tracts of ancient primates going back about 80 million years. They discovered the ancestors that led to gorillas, chimps and humans could fully di-gest alcohol at the levels found in fermenting fruits.
“It’s not quite like ‘Jurassic Park’ because we don’t resurrect the whole primate, just pieces of them,” he said.
The theory contests the common view that 
alcohol wasn’t part of humans’ Paleolithic diet because the necessary fermentation couldn’t occur without the technologies of modern civi-lization such as glass and pottery.
Benner said he believed when primates descended from trees they were exposed to fallen, fermenting fruits infected with yeast. Benner said his findings surprised him, be-cause he once thought humans didn’t drink alcohol before civilization.
Katie Ballew, a 20-year-old UF marketing 
sophomore, said she hopes Benner continues to build on the study.
“The entire theory sounds really interest-
ing,” she said. “If they’re just learning now that our ancestors had been exposed to alco-hol, imagine what else they can find out.”
Benner said he plans to continue his study 
by examining the effects of alcoholism among various populations.

The American Cancer Society’s 
Relay for Life at UF, originally 
scheduled to be outside for the first time, has to move back indoors.
Due to a 60 percent chance 
of rain, instead of running laps around Flavet Field on Friday, 94 Relay for Life teams will gather in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center to raise money for the American Cancer Society.
The event will start at 6 p.m. 
and will continue into Saturday morning.
Amanda Granozio, associate 
director at Gainesville’s American Cancer Society office, said she was upset they had to move the event inside because of the rain, but she is excited about the goal to raise $125,000.Granozio said she didn’t want 
the teams and survivors to huddle together in the rain instead of en-joying the event.
“The weather isn’t cooperat-
ing,” she said. 
Stephanie Eisenberger, UF Re-
lay for Life event co-chairwoman, said 16 more teams are participat-ing this year.

Storm surges, the massive 
floods of water that occur when 
the sea rises during a storm, are expected to increase as much as 10 times in frequency in the coming decades, according to a study led by a climate scientist.
Published Monday, the 
study indicates that if the cli-mate increases by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, then, combined with expected rising sea levels, destructive storm surges will inevitably increase in the fu-ture.
Hurricane Katrina’s storm 
surge, which made history as the highest storm surge record-ed on the U.S. coast, was 27.8 feet when it struck Pass Chris-tian, Miss., in 2005.
The hurricane was also re-
sponsible for more than 1,800 deaths. Many of those resulted from storm surges, according to the National Hurricane Center.
“By far, more people die from 
storm surge than any other part of a hurricane,” said Max May-field, the former director of the National Hurricane Center.
Mayfield, who was director 
for seven years, said sea levels rise about an inch a decade, and storm surges will increase be-cause of that.
“Whatever hurricanes we 
have will eventually do more damage because of higher storm surges,” he said.
The study used data, as far 
back as 1920s, from six tidal gauges from the East and Gulf coasts.
However, Mayfield said this 
is a very controversial subject. He thinks the number of storms and hurricanes has increased primarily because of improved technology.
“We can observe them now 
more than we ever could be-fore,” Mayfield said.
Mia Glisson, a 21-year-old 
UF nursing senior,  provided Katrina relief in 2008.
“We should definitely use 
the experiences that we had with Hurricane Katrina to learn from and create a better system for emergency disaster relief,” she said. “It definitely cannot take three or four years for a state to recover from a storm like that.”Storm surges expected

Among the many appointments that filled empty 
Senate seats at Tuesday’s meeting, one raised eyebrows.
Leah Miller, the author of a leaked controversial 
email, was appointed as the District A senator.
Miller served as the liaison between the Swamp 
Party and its fraternity house representatives during last 
month’s Student Government elections.
During that time, Miller wrote an email to 25 repre-
sentatives asking them to collect “I Voted” stickers and supply the party with a $250 check.
Sen. Morgan Vollrath was quick to bring up Miller’s 
involvement with the email. She admitted she wrote the email at the meeting.“Someone who writes in an email ‘Sketchy, but do it 
anyway!’ has no place in the Senate chamber,” Vollrath said.
The final lines of Miller’s email read: “DELETE THIS 
AFTER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ON RECORD! Sketchy, but do it! Thanks!”
Other senators defended Miller and cited her past 
experience.
“As a resident of District A, I would be more than 
proud having Leah serve as a senator,” Sen. Jamie Low-stetter said.
Miller, a political science and economics junior, has 
worked in the external affairs cabinet, Gator Growl and the Young Leaders Conference.
“Something that’s not sketchy is her devotion to the 
Student Body,” Sen. Elliot Grasso said. 
Miller declined to comment.Contact Colleen Wright at cwright@alligator.org.‘Sketchy’ email sender named senator  ◗ THE 150TH DOG

Marcus Henry changed 
his life more than a year ago.
In the process, he’s also 
changed the lives of six 
dogs, including his most re-cent four-legged companion, Newton, a Chihuahua.
As one of six inmates in 
the Gainesville Work Camp enrolled in Paws on Parole, Henry, 41, has had the op-portunity to train dogs from the Alachua County Animal Shelter.
On March 1, the program 
graduated its 150th dog.
Each eight-week training 
period is a themed academy.The current session consists of Academy 26: NCIS (New-est Canines in Service).
Newton and his former 
classmates are graduates of Academy 25: Pawpular Sci-ence.
Henry said working with 
the dogs has given him a sense of accomplishment.
“As I’m training this dog 
to be a good citizen and ev-erything, he’s training me in return as a good citizen,” he said. “So, we both have a fu-ture.”
In addition, Alachua 
County Animal Services and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office partnered this ses-sion to begin a new sister program, Paws on Parole Unleashed, which started earlier this month to include female inmates at the Alach-ua County Jail.
Each dog in Paws on Pa-
role learns the basic skills required to pass the Ameri-can Kennel Club’s Canine Good Citizen Test. During every graduation ceremony, the adopting families see the dogs conduct the test with their handlers before they take them home.
Hilary Hynes, public edu-
cation program coordinator for Alachua County Animal Services, said the program helps families continue the development of their new dog after it graduates.
“A lot of people need that 
little bit of a leg up on train-ing,” she said. “So, this is the start.”
Louis Howard, a 36-year-
old inmate, said he became a trainer 18 months ago, after a friend in the program en-couraged him. He tried it out and stuck with it.
“For us, as inmates, it just 
helps us better ourselves,” he said. “No telling, we might get out and have the oppor-tunity to train dogs so that we can make an honest liv-ing.”Puppy power: Dog

New York City’s ban on large 
sugary drinks was struck down 
last week, and some Gainesville residents and business owners voiced opposition to the idea of a similar law coming to town.
Adam Brewer, 32, owner and 
operator of Adam’s Rib Co., said if there was a similar ban on sugary drinks proposed locally, he wouldn’t let it happen.“I totally would fight this 100 
percent,” he said. “There are just too many people out there depending on soft drink sales. …    It’s a money maker.”
New York City’s ban was set 
to go into effect March 12.
It would have limited the sale 
of sugary drinks to containers of no more than 16 ounces. 
But a New York Supreme 
Court judge declared the ban invalid.
The ban would have applied to some food establishments and excluded certain beverages that have more calories and sugar. 
The ruling was in response to 
a lawsuit filed last fall by several business associations challenging the ban.
Laura Acosta, owner of 
LifeStyle Wellness and a registered dietician in Gainesville, said she sees New York City’s good intention for putting a ban on sugary drinks.
However, she also said she 
believed education about the high number of calories and obesity would be more effective.
“I feel like making a law 
sometimes just makes people resentful,” she said. “It’s up to the person to 
decide. If they don’t care, they don’t care.”
Amanda Fretz, a 19-year-
old UF junior studying Spanish, said she supports the ban from a health perspective. 
But she said it would be 
harmful to restaurants.
“Until we find a way to … still 
maintain customer satisfaction while trying to be healthier, then I just can’t see it happening,” she said.
Gainesville residents reject idea of ban on large, sugary drinks
UF police enforces the current law prohibiting concealed carry
nonpartisan organization, advocates for legal 
concealed carry on college campuses in the U.S. as an effective means of self-defense.
“States tend to go in opposite directions,” 
said Kurt Mueller, the national director of strategy for the organization. “Overall, it is important to ensure democracy and the right of the Second Amendment to all citizens and not to limit that right by any means.”
UF has its own chapter of Students for 
Concealed Carry. 
The organization holds an “empty holster” 
protest each year where supporters gather with empty gun holsters on their belts to sym-bolize that they are unarmed and unhappy. The next one is April 8, said 23-year-old Tyler Marzella, the chapter’s president and an agri-culture operations management senior.
However, Lauren Nickoloff, director 
of outreach for the UF College Democrats, doesn’t think guns should be allowed on cam-pus.
“In my opinion, concealed carry encourag-
es vigilante justice, rash acts and it is likely to cause more harm than it would protect,” the 19-year-old political science sophomore said.
UPD Captain Jeff Holcomb said Univer-
sity Police stands by the law that prohibits any means of concealed carry on college cam-puses in Florida.
“We currently enforce the law in place [in] 
Florida and agree with our chiefs that that’s the way we want to remain here in Florida,” he said.

TUESDAY.

UF was recognized Tuesday for its tree-
friendliness.
About 30 people planted 40 native trees 
donated by the Arbor Day Foundation and 
Toyota at the University Park Arboretum near the President’s House, 2151 W. University Ave., according to a news release.
The arboretum is meant to be a collection 
of trees for scientific study, said Jason Smith, an associate professor in the UF School of For-est Resources & Conservation; however, the grounds have a sparse amount of trees.
“Hopefully, with the new trees, it can be 
used for that,” he said.
The tree planting served as the annual 
service-learning project, required of campuses that are considered Tree Campus USA Col-leges.
“The event showed the work of the last two 
semesters had meaning,” Taylor Cremo said.The 22-year-old UF sustainability and the 
built environment senior has spent two semes-ters completing a five-part application for UF to receive the recognition. Being recognized as a Tree Campus USA College means the uni-versity effectively cares for its trees, connects with off-campus communities to promote urban forests and engages students in service-learning activities, according to the Arbor Day Foundation.
However, Cremo said, UF has always been 
a tree-friendly campus.
“It was just about taking all the informa-
tion that already existed and putting it into one application,” she said.
For example, a campus tree care plan, 
which UF has, is one of the required standards to qualify for the distinction.
In addition, a university must have a cam-
pus tree advisory committee, a campus tree program with dedicated annual expenditures and an Arbor Day observance.
“The largest step was figuring out where 
to find the right sources,” Cremo said. “And after that, it was just time and patience of put-ting it together.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

How Do You Roll?, a custom sushi restaurant across from 
The Swamp, has opened its doors for business. 
The restaurant, 1802 W. University Ave., offers fresh and 
unique ingredients, said co-owner Ellen Aschenbrener.
“We’re kind of like sushi rebels,” she said.
Customers can choose a predesigned roll — which cost be-
tween $3 and $7 — or create their own for $4 to $6. The res-taurant also offers rice bowls, vegan and gluten-free rolls and 13 rolls with fewer than 300 calories, Aschenbrener said. Her husband, co-owner Matt Aschenbrener, said about 60 percent of people choose pre-designed rolls. 
UF advertising sophomore Jen Wallshein said she liked how 
there was no extra charge for dipping sauces or brown rice.
“The idea of being able to customize your own roll appeals 
to many students,” Wallshein said. The 20-year-old said the long line and slow service was discouraging when she first ar-rived. But, she said, the owners made up for it by giving cus-tomers free mochi balls.
Matt Aschenbrener said challenge they’re facing right now 
is parking. 
With no street parking directly outside the restaurant and 
a parking garage that’s still under construction, people must walk or park blocks away. 
He hopes to alleviate the problem.The owners said they are working on building an outdoor

44% NOTuesday’s question: Were you scared by what happened at UCF?On the Wings of 
Twitter: 
Jack Dorsey for 
Mayor?
Nearly two years ago, Vanity Fair interviewed Twitter’s 
founder, Jack Dorsey.
The article described how, as a boy, he was “mes-
merized by locomotives, police cars, and taxis,” “taught himself programming to learn how to make little dots — representing trains and buses — scoot around the maps,” and “spent hours listening to police and ambulance radio frequencies, then plot-ted the emergency vehicles as they moved toward an accident or a hospital.”
Why? “I wanted to play with how the city worked, so I could 
see it,” Dorsey said in the interview. In 2006, he worked for a struggling startup called Odeo. He pitched an idea to “create a service that would allow anyone to write a line or two about himself, using a cellphone’s keypad, and then send that message to anyone who wanted to receive it” because it would “add a missing human element to the digital picture of a pulsing, popu-lated city.”
 Twitter was born.  In 2008, he was slightly ousted for a time 
from the company. He talked with his friend Jim McKelvey,  who told him about one of his customers who couldn’t make a purchase because he didn’t have a way to accept an American Express card for payment.
“I was struck with the irony,” said McKelvey according to the 
Vanity Fair article. “I’m talking to my business partner on this device that has all the technology I need to solve the problem I just had.” He proposed they build a way for people to make and accept credit card payments on smartphones.
“I’m like, ‘Wow — this is pretty interesting,’” Dorsey said. 
“This is actually another dot that is more activity on the map.”
Square was born. Have you seen those small devices attached 
to iPads or iPhones that allow businesses to accept credit or deb-it card payments? That’s Square. He’s a billionaire because of these two innovations. Why is he making headlines now, when Square launched in 2010? Because he’s interested in one day be-coming New York City’s mayor.
The Vanity Fair article reported that “although he currently 
lives in San Francisco, his ultimate aspiration is to become mayor of New York. He’s even spoken to Michael Bloomberg about it. (According to Dorsey, the current mayor’s advice was to make a lot of money ﬁ  rst. Dorsey’s personal wealth exceeds $300 mil-lion.)”
We think it’s a kind of crazy leap to go from Internet super-
star to mayor of basically any city, let alone New York City.
However, we think that could be a really smart choice for 
New York. Hear us out: If Dorsey decides to run, he would progress New York to be more connected and more in touch with itself.
We hope he does decide to run and that all of you decide to 
read that Vanity Fair article because it’s damn interesting. We could all use a dose of inspiration. From soda bans to tobacco stands
Since he took ofﬁ  ce, New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg has been on a crusade to make his city a healthy and safe place to live, and he’s banning 
just about anything and everything he can to make it that way.
Bloomberg has banned or has tried to ban food dona-
tions to the homeless, loud earphones and Styrofoam.
The most controversial of Bloomberg’s attempts to pro-
tect us from ourselves was a ban on sugary drinks more than 16 ounces. 
Fortunately, this policy was recently struck down by 
the New York State Supreme Court.
But this hasn’t stopped Bloomberg’s messianic mission 
to save us all from our own vices – or at least all of the citizens in New York City.
Next, Bloomberg wants stores that sell cigarettes and 
other tobacco products to hide all displays of these prod-ucts, which can usually be found behind the counter. 
These displays, according to the nosey neighbor mayor, 
“invite young people to experiment with tobacco.”
While there are major First Amendment implications 
for restricting the ability of a company to relay truthful, non-misleading information to its consumers about its products and price, this latest step by Bloomberg shows his fundamental distrust of the ability (and rights) of peo-ple to decide how to conduct their own lives, raise their own children, eat what they want to eat, drink what they want to drink and live how they want to live.
Arguments about the growth of the nanny state have 
nothing to do with what’s “best for us or our health.” 
They have everything to do with taking away our 
choices and our freedom while making us idly dependent upon the government to keep us from putting bad things in our bodies and protecting us from actions that might harm us.
There is no doubt that seat-belts save lives. There is no 
doubt that cigarettes are bad for you.There is no doubt that 
limiting the consumption of sodas and other fatty foods contributes to health and wellbeing.
But just because you be-
lieve that a lifestyle without these unhealthy habits and reckless practices is the best 
way to live, it still doesn’t give you or Mayor Bloomberg or anyone the right to limit the choices that other people have and the decisions they’re allowed to make about their own lives.
Some have argued that we have to limit unhealthy life-
styles because we all bear the cost of health insurance. 
But that’s not an argument for creating a bureaucratic 
nanny state that limits the choices we can make; it’s an argument for reforming our broken health care system.
Lack of consumer choice in medical care is one of the 
main reasons our health care system is so messed up. 
Additionally, a health care system that makes everyone 
interdependent through taxpayer subsidies, over regula-tion and government intervention is hardly a strong justi-ﬁ  cation for limiting even more of our choices.
The nanny state only grows because we allow politi-
cians like Bloomberg to ban, regulate and restrict the free-doms and choices we have. 
At some point, we need to stand up and demand that 
we be treated like adults who can make adult choices, even if some of us choose unhealthy lifestyles.
In the end, the only way to ensure that individuals 
make good decisions is if they are allowed to make dumb decisions and take personal responsibility for their mis-takes.

jhayes@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, MARCH 20, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
This piece is written in response to Sarah Platt’s guest 
column regarding advertising in society. An answer to the question she posed: I strongly believe society 
shapes the media.
Advertisements are made to relate to the audiences 
with whom they are communicating. If they follow the correct procedure, advertising research of target audienc-es ﬁ  nds out how consumers think and feel. The ﬁ  ndings are then analyzed and applied to develop the strategy of advertising campaigns.
It is correct that stereotypes often have negative con-
notations and make assumptions that are not always true. However, we often make the mistake of mislabeling gen-eralizations that are arguably evident in society as stereo-types.
I think that a man’s weight-loss process is signiﬁ  cantly 
different from a woman’s. It’s science. Our bodies are made differently, so how they function differs as well.
Also, if I were on a quest to 
lose weight, I’d certainly be in-terested in a solution that offered me the chance to eat the foods I’d like to eat. Advertisements didn’t 
engrave that in my head: It’s a personal sentiment that I think many other women of all ages would agree with.
Although you may feel there are too many gender 
stereotypes presented in advertising, I think they may merely be a reﬂ  ection of the world around us.
Advertisements have the power to change perceptions, 
but I believe, for the most part, they are a mirror image of what happens in our world. Perhaps members of society should work on eliminating negative stereotypes in their everyday lives so advertisers wouldn’t have to reinforce them — as that seems to be the most effective way they relate to and communicate with consumers.
I also wanted to respond to Ashley Miller-Shaked’s 
guest column “What women want: good vs. bad guys.” I have had this conversation several times with female friends and have come to a common conclusion: There is nothing wrong with a “good guy,”  just not everybody likes guys who some consider to be a “pushover.” Some-body who will be a bit of a challenge is often more intrigu-ing than someone who is too kind and very predictable. To quote Lady Gaga’s song, “Yoü and I”: “There’s some-thing, something about the chase.” People often want something they can’t or shouldn’t have. For what reason? I really couldn’t tell you, except that it provides a sense of adventure to some.
A friend told me her ideal guy isn’t necessarily bad, 
but he has a little bit of an edge. Everybody has some-thing that makes them interesting and intriguing. Guys who are “too nice” get a bad reputation for being overly dedicated to the person who interests them. The words “sprung” and “whipped” describe a person who seems to wait hand-and-foot on a signiﬁ  cant other. Surprising to me, it’s a huge turnoff for some girls. In a similar manner, I suppose some guys may feel “goody-two-shoes” girls are no fun and are too clean-cut or well-behaved to date.
Hopefully as we grow and mature, young adults will 
start to realize that ﬁ  nding genuinely positive qualities and traits in others should be embraced and appreciated rather than frowned upon.
Everyone is different, but my personal deﬁ  nition of a 
masculine man is someone who would go out of his way to do anything for anybody he is passionate about.
I’m not saying the ideal man is a submissive personal 
servant, but I do believe he should enjoy showing appre-ciation for whomever he cares for. Not necessarily ma-terial things. The time it takes to let someone know you genuinely care and want to show it is enough.
Lastly, in regard to the statement about how different 
inﬂ  uences make women feel, I believe girls should always be able to recognize their self-worth on their own — with or without the afﬁ  rmation of society, a guy or a media outlet.

Speaking OutIf you put a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will jump 
out immediately, clambering its way to safety.
If you drop it in lukewarm water and turn the 
burner on low, it will ﬂ  oat quietly and calmly in the pot, unaware of any danger. 
Gradually heat up the water and watch as the frog 
sinks into what author Daniel Quinn called a “tranquil stupor.” 
The water will eventually boil, and the frog, unlike 
the one that survived in Al Gore’s version, will cook to death.
I use this metaphor to illustrate man’s inability to 
react to the steady decline of a moral authority in our society — an authority that has gradually been replaced by everything and everyone except — gasp! — God.
I remember what happened last year at the Demo-
cratic National Convention.
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa brought an 
effort to amend their party platform by adding a men-tion of God and declaring Jerusalem the capital of Is-rael. 
Like Peter, the delegates denied the amendment 
three times. 
Despite the majority who cried “nay,” the motion 
was adopted and the platform amended.
This wasn’t the ﬁ  rst time Democrats tried to expunge 
a reference to God, as if using it usurps individuals’ right to freely and willingly choose what and who they should believe in.
Throughout the years, their moral ineptitude brought 
about a deliberate movement to eschew spiritual inﬂ  u-ences and godliness in society.
In the name of the First Amendment, public schools 
can no longer call for prayer. 
Classrooms won’t discuss Scripture. And the “under God” mantra in the Pledge of Alle-
giance is ofﬁ  cially, and sadly, under assault.
In our country’s history, it wasn’t unusual to pray.It wasn’t ghastly to espouse biblical messages. Our Founding Fathers understood they couldn’t 
mold man. 
Instead, they relied on moral men to mold govern-
ment. 
Religion, to them, was essential.Mention God today, and secularists will shout, “Sep-
aration of church and state! Separation of church and state!”           
Thomas Jefferson’s “wall of separation” protected an 
individual’s faith against governmental interference. It prevented the state from becoming church. 
In other words, it guarded local churches from the 
government.Public displays and proc-
lamations of faith, however, are not unconstitutional.
George Washington be-
lieved, “Religion and moral-ity are indispensable sup-ports.” 
Some people even attri-
bute him as saying,  “it [was] 
impossible to rightly govern the world without God and the Bible.”
Benjamin Franklin warned an unknown atheist, “If 
Men are so wicked as we now see them with Religion, what would they be if without it?
In “Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,” Carrie Fish-
er as Princess Leia was forced to strap down her breasts because her white dress didn’t permit any lingerie to be worn underneath. 
Fast-forward to “Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the 
Jedi,” and Princess Leia is depicted on the poster in an outﬁ  t one might see at Cafe Risque.
Our culture’s perception of right and wrong is con-
stantly evolving, for lack of a better word.
Truth is relative.Admonishment is tantamount to judgment.  British writer and journalist G. K. Chesterton said, 
“When people cease to believe in God, they don’t be-lieve in nothing; they believe in anything.”
Look around.People will worship anything: globalism, diversity, 
environmentalism, statism — you name it! 
God has effectively been replaced by worthless 
-isms. 
Conforming is cool. We kneel at the altar of narcissism and self-aggran-
dizement. 
We idolize hedonism.Yet it’s news to us when high schools have daycares 
and health classes teach students how to unravel con-doms on cucumbers (or, in my case, carrots).
Recently, the Future of Sex Education (as well as 
many other associations) has been developing the stan-dards to educate kindergarteners about “comprehen-sive sexuality.”
Soon, 5-year-olds will know the ABCs of STDs, and 
Daniel and the Lions’ Den will be replaced by demon-strations of Barbie straddling Ken.
Just don’t mention God, though. That’s intolerant.

Taylor Gushue got the cold 
shoulder from his teammates af-
ter one of his best moments this season.
The sophomore catcher led off 
the bottom of the fourth inning with a solo home run to left field — his first of the season — to put Florida up 3-0 against North Florida on Tuesday night. 
The home run was Gushue’s 
first since March 18, 2012, in an 8-2 win against Vanderbilt.
Once he got back to the dug-
out, his teammates jokingly ig-nored him for a short time before congratulating him.
“It felt good to get it out of 
the way,” Gushue said of his first home run. “It’s tough, you know, sitting around, just like, ‘OK, when’s it going to happen?’ and then just not pressing to actually get it.”
Gushue went 2 for 4 — his 
first multi-hit game in 10 days — as Florida (10-12) defeated North Florida (15-7) 9-4 on Tuesday night at McKethan Stadium.
Last season, Gushue hit .290 
with five home runs and 16 RBI in UF’s first 20 games. He didn’t hit a home run the rest of the sea-son, finishing the year with a .206 batting average as he struggled to adjust to Southeastern Confer-ence pitching.
Gushue was expected to be a 
primary source of power for the Gators in 2013, but prior to Tues-day night, he was homerless with a .232 batting average.
Gushue said he is trying to 
avoid getting too tense at the plate.
“It’s all about relaxing,” Gush-
ue said.
“It’s all about seeing the ball. 
Not muscling anything.”
Sophomore designated hitter 
Justin Shafer gave the Gators an early 2-0 lead as he took Ospreys starter David Trexler deep to left field for his second home run of the season.
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan said he’d like to see more power from both Shafer and Gushue as the season progresses.
“Those guys are hitting in the middle of the order for a reason,” O’Sullivan said. “We’re going to need that from them as the sea-son goes on.”In his first start since O’Sullivan 
removed him from the weekend

Although the Gators will not be 
dancing this postseason, they still have 
the opportunity to continue playing.
After failing to be selected to the 
NCAA Tournament, UF learned late Monday night that it earned an at-large bid to the WNIT. Florida will face Flor-ida International in the first round on Thursday at U.S. Century Bank Arena in Miami.
“We can’t dwell on disappointment 
(from not being selected to the NCAA Tournament), we just don’t have time for that,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We’ve got a new mission, (and) we’re excited about that mission.” 
The NCAA Selection Committee’s 
decision to exclude the Gators from the 64-team field was unsurprising. Florida (18-14) dealt with inexperience and in-jury throughout the season and strug-gled en route to an eighth-place tie in the Southeastern Conference. 
Without a true signature victory, 
UF’s only hope of making the Big Dance 
hinged on earn-ing an automatic bid by winning the SEC Tourna-ment. 
However, after defeating Arkansas 
in the first round, Florida lost 82-73 to top-seeded and ninth-ranked Tennes-see in the quarterfinals on March 8 to all but seal its trip to the WNIT.
Despite failing to earn a second con-
secutive NCAA Tournament selection, which would have been a first under Butler, the WNIT berth represents Flor-ida’s sixth straight postseason appear-ance.
UF last failed to make the postseason 
following the 2006-07 season, when the Gators suffered through a disastrous Gators earn WNIT berthFlorida bats come alive in win against North Florida

Brian Poole seems to be the only guy 
who can slow down Loucheiz Purifoy.
The sophomore made a big hit on Puri-
foy during Monday’s practice.
“I got blew up by Poole,” Purifoy said. 
“That’s a big hit he gave me.”
Poole later stripped the ball from Pu-
rifoy during a tackling drill, putting the 
Gators’ returning leader in forced fumbles on the unfamiliar end of a turnover.
“I’m not a violator,” Purifoy said de-
spite coughing up the football.
Jaylen Watkins added: “[Poole] got the 
best of Loucheiz all day [Monday].”
Since spring practice began on March 
13, Purifoy has practiced exclusively as a wide receiver and on special teams. Coach Will Muschamp hopes adding Purifoy to the mix at wide receiver will help shore up a unit that underperformed in 2012.
Though he will remain an option of-
fensively, Purifoy will rejoin the defense following Saturday’s practice — Florida’s seventh this spring.
“He’s going to come back to defense, 
and we will decide then how much we will expand his role offensively throughout the rest of the spring,” Muschamp said. “He’s 
still going to have a role offensively, but he needs 
to get back and rep some on defense as well.”
Although Muschamp 
said that Purifoy would remain a defensive player, the junior’s per-formance at receiver has impressed teammates.
“He’s definitely developing every prac-
tice with his route progression and mak-ing the right reads and cuts,” cornerback Jeremy Brown said. “He’s going to be spe-cial. He’s going to make a lot of plays on offense this year.”
Quarterback Jeff Driskel added: “I was 
happy when they told me he was going to Junior cornerback adjusting 
to life as two-way player

◗ THE GATORS SCORED 22 GOALS.

  Twenty-two goals and a diamond ring 
capped a ﬂ  awless night for Emily Dohony and UF at Dizney Stadium.
  During Florida’s post-game exercise, 
her boyfriend of four years proposed to Dohony with her team, family and fans watching. She said yes.
  “This team is my family just as much as 
my family,” Dohony said.
  She was happy about the win, too.  No. 2 Florida (12-0) routed Stetson (0-8) 
in a 22-1 victory on Tuesday night.
  With a 5-0 lead, coach Amanda O’Leary 
had pulled every single starter out of the game by the 8-minute mark.
  The Gators won every statistical cat-
egory, except saves. Florida took 38 shots. Stetson had one. 
  Five of UF’s shots came from freshman 
Hayler Katzenberger, who scored her ﬁ  rst three college goals in Florida’s win.
  “It was great,” Katzenberger said. “It 
felt good to ﬁ  nally get some goals in.”
  Freshman Lizzie Strazza and sopho-
more Mikki Ofﬁ  t also tallied their ﬁ  rst col-lege goals.
  “It is a great thing (to see the freshmen 
score their ﬁ  rst goals),” O’Leary said. “Ev-ery one of them were unselﬁ  sh and that was the key tonight to our success, because we had multiple goal scorers.”
  Sophomore Nora Barry led the starters with three goals on three shots. She has scored 17 goals on 23 shots this season.
  UF’s 22 goals mark its highest total this 
year and tied for the third-best mark in program history.
  While the offense padded its lead, the 
defense clamped down.
  Anchored by freshman Sam Darcange-
lo, the Gators held the Hatters to only one goal, which is the lowest total by a UF op-ponent this year and Florida’s best defen-sive performance since a shutout against Fresno State on March 28, 2012.
  “We’ve been learning a lot from the old-
er girls,” Darcangelo said. “They’ve deﬁ  -
nitely been helping us a lot, and we’ve been working very hard in practice.”
  Darcangelo ﬁ  nished with a career-high 
six draw controls, stepping up as the draw specialist while sophomore Shannon Gil-roy and senior Brittany Dashiell rested.
  Florida allowed Stetson to move it to the 
offensive third of the ﬁ  eld only 10 times. Only one Hatters possession ended with a shot. The other nine were turnovers.
  “The man-to-man ride against Stetson 
was a big factor to those turnovers,” O’Leary said. “It just worked out to our favor.”
  Stetson is a ﬁ  rst-year lacrosse program 
and is only the third in Florida.
  “We know how it feels to be a ﬁ  rst-year 
program,” Dohony said. “It’s a huge step that they are taking, and we see them may-be following us in our shoes one day.”  Senior accepts marriage

  In high-pressure scenarios, coach Tim 
Walton turns to Lauren Haeger.
  Since she arrived at Florida, Haeger 
has been the Gators’ go-to closing pitch-
er.
  “That’s a role that Lauren has em-
braced since she’s been here,” Walton said.
  Haeger entered No. 3 Florida’s (27-
3, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) game against No. 8 Tennessee (23-6, 3-3 SEC) on Sunday in the seventh inning with runners on ﬁ  rst and second. In a two-out jam, Haeger induced an inning-ending groundout.
  She returned in the eighth and walked 
a batter before ending the frame un-scathed.
  The appearance was Haeger’s second 
scoreless relief outing against a ranked team in a week.
  Against Alabama on March 6, Haeger 
threw two scoreless innings against the then-No. 1 Crimson Tide. She struck out four batters while holding Alabama hit-less.
  “Coach tells me all the time that that’s 
where he likes me the best,” Haeger said. “He says, ‘I see it in your eyes when you really want the ball.’”
  But Haeger does not always lock 
down the opposition when she comes in to close out a game.
  Against the Volunteers on Friday, 
Walton entrusted Haeger with a 5-3 lead she failed to protect.
  After retiring the leadoff batter, the sophomore surrendered a single to Ten-nessee third baseman Raven Chavanne and a homer to second baseman Lauren Gibson, tying the game.
  Haeger loaded the bases before end-
ing the inning with a groundout, but the damage had been done.
  “I know everybody jumped to con-
clusions on Friday night,” Walton said. “She’s done very, very, very well. … If 
we don’t give them four 
outs on Friday night, we might look like ge-niuses. It’s something that she embraces. She wanted the ball in that situation.”
  Haeger’s clutch per-
formances against Ten-
nessee were not limited to the pitching circle.
  She came up in Sunday’s sixth in-
ning with Florida trailing by three runs. The Gators had not scored until Haeger launched a ball to the left of the score-board in left-center ﬁ  eld.
  The sophomore came up again two in-
nings later and won the series for Florida with her second home run of the day and third of the series. She was named co-SEC Player of the Week for her performance.
  “It’s just a good player making some 
adjustments,” Walton said. “[Tennessee pitcher Ivy Renfroe] owned Lauren on Friday night. … It was a good individual performance by Lauren.”
  Haeger and Florida face USC Upstate 
(21-2) tonight a 6 p.m.

UF Lacrosserotation, freshman Tucker Simpson impressed on 
the mound.
Simpson threw a career-high 5.2 innings and 
struck out five batters while allowing three runs. He also picked up the first victory for a UF starter since Florida’s 7-1 Super Regional win against N.C. State on June 9.
“I was able to get into a rhythm,” Simpson said. 
“Especially in the second inning, knowing we put two runs up in the first, and then I was able to get a little more comfortable.”
The Ospreys threatened but were unable to come 
back.
With the Gators leading 4-1 in the top of the 
sixth, they finally got to Simpson with back-to-back two-out singles. Shafer replaced Simpson and gave up a two-run double to UNF third baseman Paul Karmeris.
O’Sullivan didn’t want to go so far as to say the 
win was Florida’s most complete victory of the sea-son.
But he did note that it came at an important time 
with a series against No. 2 Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tenn., beginning on Friday.
“It was a game that I thought we did a lot of good 
things in,” O’Sullivan said.
“We obviously needed a little momentum going 
into the weekend.”
Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurnovoy@alligator.org.be on our side for the first part of spring. He’s 
an athletic freak, and he’s a guy we want to get the ball, and he’s done a good job so far. He’s really embraced the challenge and done a good job.”
While Purifoy has impressed on offense, 
switching sides of the ball has not been easy for the Pensacola native. Adjusting to offen-sive coordinator Brent Pease’s scheme has proven challenging.
“I’m comfortable in the routes, but now it’s 
just learning the play-calling,” Purifoy said. “It’s starting to grow a lot now, lately. At first it was kind of frustrating, but I’m starting to learn it faster.”
In addition to the challenge of learning 
Pease’s offense, Purifoy is putting up with extra attention from  UF’s secondary. Brown said Purifoy is “on the dark side” when lined up at wide receiver.
“It’s competition, of course,” Purifoy said. 
“They see me on offense, so of course they’re going to head-hunt me.”
Even defensive backs coach Travaris Rob-
inson got involved, teasing Purifoy when he complained about a holding call during a one-on-one drill against Watkins on Saturday.
“Come on home, Lou!” Robinson yelled 
while laughing.
For Watkins, Poole’s big hit on Monday 
was the highlight of the secondary’s new ri-valry with Purifoy.
“He doesn’t like to be picked at, so we 
obviously took advantage of that moment,” Watkins said. “We all just get in his face a little bit and tell him he needs to be back on defense. So with Brian hitting him and strip-ping him, that’s kind of like us antagonizing him.”
While Purifoy will play primarily on de-
fense in 2013, he expects to earn game reps on offense, defense, punts, kickoffs and kickoff returns.
“Yeah, that’s a lot, but I can handle it,” he 
said.

Florida  will play Florida International in the first round of the WNIT on Thursday night at 7 in U.S. 
Century Bank Arena in Miami. The Gators enter the tournament with an 18-14 record this season.

9-22 campaign that led to the dis-
missal of Carolyn Peck.
Butler has led the Gators to 
two appearances in the NCAA Tournament and four trips to the WNIT during her six seasons. Florida most recently played in the WNIT two seasons ago, ad-vancing to the third round before dropping an 81-77 overtime con-test to Charlotte. 
Jaterra Bonds, who was a 
freshman on the team, led the Gators with 23 points in the loss. The junior guard was Florida’s top scorer this season, averaging 12.7 points per game. 
The Gators have failed to ad-
vance past the third round of the WNIT during Butler’s tenure, but Bonds hopes a successful run can help redeem an otherwise frus-trating season.
“As a team, especially as a big 
BCS school and being Florida, you never want to go to the lesser tournament,” Bonds said. “So it’s a disappointment, but we still want to prove a point.” 
Progressing deeper in the 
WNIT could also have long-term benefits. With the Gators expected to lose only senior Jen-nifer George from this season’s team, extra weeks of practice and meaningful games will help the development of Florida’s return-ers. 
Butler said that is one of the 
main things she hopes her team takes away from the experience.
“The more games that get 
played, the better they are go-ing to be, especially those young players,” Butler said. “It’s a great opportunity to continue to de-velop, to continue to figure out who we are as a unit, because the reality is we are playing for right now but a majority of this unit will be back next year.
“As far as we can go this year 
is going to give us a head start for those guys as they move for-ward.”

UF coach  Davidson, Belmont, Minnesota and St. 
Mary’s will be the teams that defy their seeding and open the Big Dance 
with upsets. 
  I say this not just because those teams are 
good — an obvious prerequisite — but be-
cause they most closely resemble the teams that have slain Goliaths before. 
  In the past 10 seasons, 43 teams seeded 11 
or lower have won their ﬁ  rst-round matchup. 
  A close examination of the winner’s Ken-
Pom.com proﬁ  le, the loser’s KenPom.com proﬁ  le and the box score reveals some inter-esting trends. 
  Every upset is different, but offense was 
usually the biggest key to underdog success. 
  Taken as a group, the 43 games can be 
treated as a season, with all of the upset win-ners viewed collectively as Team Underdog. That team posted a 110.9 offensive efﬁ  ciency and a 99.5 defensive efﬁ  ciency. Because the national average for efﬁ  ciency in 2013 is 100.6, we see that these teams have been much more reliant on offense than defense. 
  The key to this offensive success has been 
multifaceted, but the biggest difference is that Team Underdog hits a berserk percentage of threes. The average three-point shooting per-centage of the winners was an absurd 43.4 per-cent. If an NCAA team shot 43.4 percent from three in 2013, it would lead the nation in that category by a full percentage point.
  Team Underdog’s offensive success has 
also been related to not turning the ball over. On average, those upset winners gave it away on just 17.9 percent of possessions. The 2013 NCAA average is 20. 
  Team Underdog was also good at shooting 
twos (49.4 percent), getting to the free-throw line (40 FTA/FGA, 2013 NCAA average is 36), and keeping the favorite off the charity stripe (allowing 31.3 FTA/FGA). 
  To try to determine how predictable those 
results might be, I looked at the advanced stats proﬁ  le of all 43 upset winners on KenPom.com. Unsurprisingly, the teams were usually pretty good, with an average offensive efﬁ  -ciency of 108.7 and an average defensive efﬁ  -ciency of 94.8. Many of their strengths in the upsets mimic what they did successfully dur-ing the season. 
  On average, they shot well from three (35.7 
percent), shot well from two (49.9 percent) and got to the free-throw line (37.9 FTA/FGA). They were also good at offensive rebound-ing (34.6 percent, 2013 NCAA average is 31.8) and forcing turnovers (22 percent of opponent possessions), although these strengths did not consistently show in their upsets.  
  So, taken as a whole, I’m looking for upset 
candidates who, in order:
  1. Have strong offensive efﬁ  ciencies  2. Shoot threes well  3. Avoid turnovers  4. Play adequate defense  5. Get to the free-throw line  6. Shoot twos well  7. Keep opponents off the free-throw line  8. Offensive rebound  9. Force turnovers  10. Don’t have any glaring weaknesses  But there are two parts to every upset. 
What teams are the most vulnerable? In my ﬁ  ndings, the teams that got upset averaged a 113.5 offensive efﬁ  ciency rating and a 92.6 defensive efﬁ  ciency rating during the season, meaning they were also offense-ﬁ  rst teams. 
  Because they were seeded high enough to 
be upset candidates, there isn’t really a lot of negative things to say about them as a group. The only trend I could really ﬁ  nd was that they were all average in terms of turnovers (give-aways on 19.6 per-cent of possessions), forcing turnovers (takeaways on 20.6 percent of posses-sions) and defensive rebounding (allowed 31.8 percent offensive rebounding). 
  Based on the same game data I mentioned 
before — only this time viewing the 43 games as a season for Team Favorite — I’m looking for 2013 teams that don’t defend well, don’t force turnovers, don’t get to the free-throw line and put the other team on the free-throw line too often.   The game data also showed that Team Favorite would often become three-pointer happy and go on missing sprees. 
  So, taken as a whole, I’m looking for upset 
candidates who: 
  1. Focus more on offense than defense  2. Don’t take care of the ball  3. Don’t force turnovers  4. Don’t win the free-throw battle  5. Sometimes go insane from outside   Before I get to the picks, one important 
note is that these factors can only do so much to make up gaps in efﬁ  ciency. For example, No. 16 seed LIU Brooklyn is an offense-ﬁ  rst team that shoots well, wins the battle of the free-throw line and grabs offensive rebounds. But it ranks No. 319 in defensive efﬁ  ciency, so picking LIU to beat No. 1 seed Indiana would be moronic. 
  The deepest, darkest sleeper picks I would 
never advise making are (15) Iona over (2) Ohio State and (15) Florida Gulf Coast over (2) Georgetown.  Iona shoots a lot of threes fairly accurately without turning the ball over, and FGCU could force some turnovers. But neither is truly good enough to be expected to win.
  I considered (13) South Dakota State over 
(4) Michigan, as this game should become a jump-shooting contest that could go either way. 
  (12) Ole Miss is solid all around and won’t 
turn the ball over, but its style matches up ter-ribly with (5) Wisconsin. 
  (11) Bucknell won’t exploit (6) Butler’s 
turnover problem, but it could put up enough threes to be dangerous. 
  As for the picks I actually am making:  -(14) Davidson beats (3) Marquette: Da-
vidson won’t turn the ball over and should get good looks at threes. The Wildcats should  hold their own on the boards, and they have the big men to contain Davante Gardner. I worry they won’t stop Vander Blue on the pe-rimeter, but I can’t go against the stats.
  -(11) Minnesota beats (6) UCLA: The Bruins 
are an offense-ﬁ  rst team that doesn’t rebound, force turnovers or get to the line. The Golden Gophers, the nation’s leader in offensive re-bounding percentage, will own the boards, and UCLA won’t make the most of Minne-sota’s turnover problem. The Gophers are ﬂ  at-out better on both sides of the ball, especially after the injury to the Bruins’ Jordan Adams. 
  -(11) Belmont beats (6) Arizona: Belmont 
forces turnovers and can exploit a careless Arizona offense. The Bruins will also take and make a lot of threes, as the Wildcats won’t force turnovers. In a battle of two offense-ﬁ  rst teams, Belmont will have the edge if this be-comes a shooting contest. 
  -(11) St. Mary’s beats (6) Memphis: My 
system likes Memphis, save for their turnover problem, but St. Mary’s is the more efﬁ  cient team regardless. With a low-turnover, three-happy offense and average defense, the Gaels are primed to bust some brackets.
