STRUGGLING GATORS IN NEED OF HELP

 Alligator Staff Writer
 AUBURN, Ala. — For the second 
straight year, the Gators’ sizzling start 
has given way to an October meltdown. 
  Undefeated beginnings in both 2010 
and 2011 have been precursors to three-
game losing streaks; the ﬁ  rst time Florida 
has lost three straight games in consecu-tive seasons since 1950-51.
  And, like in 2010, the third loss was 
a low-scoring, ghastly slugfest devoid of big plays or excitement for UF. Of the game’s 27 drives, 17 went for four plays or fewer, as both teams struggled to es-tablish any type of rhythm. 
  The Florida offense could never get 
off the ground, gaining just 194 yards as a result of spotty quarterback play and an inconsistent running game in Satur-day’s 17-6 loss at No. 19 Auburn (5-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference). 
  As was the case after a similarly grisly 
loss to Mississippi State last season, Flor-ida (4-3, 2-3 SEC) now looks to the bye 
week for a way to salvage 2011.

After falling to Auburn 17-6 on Saturday, Florida will need South Carolina or Georgia to lose a 
game to have any hope of winning the Southeastern Conference East division.

  AUBURN, AlaOn the ﬁ  nal play of the game 
Saturday , Jeff Driskel was still ﬁ  ghting for something. Pride, 
maybe.
  He dropped back, eyed the end zone 
and set his feet. And then … sacked, blind-sided. Therein lie Florida’s prob-lems the last two weeks.
  Sure, the Gators have been handi-
capped with two freshman quarter-backs. And, yeah, Charlie Weis’ offense has become downright Addazio-esque. But at its root, Florida just isn’t talented enough — at any position.
  That offensive line, the one that gave 
up four sacks Saturday? It hasn’t helped at all. Against the best Southeastern Conference teams — the ones Florida once competed with, once made a joke of, even — the Gators have gained just 194 rushing yards in three games, in-cluding 66 on Saturday.

  The arrest of Bo Diddley’s son and three other Occupy 
Gainesville protesters has attracted international attention, 
and members of the movement plan to keep up its momen-
tum.
  Occupy Gainesville members are staying put on the 
downtown Bo Diddley Community Plaza during public 
hours but have to move to the sidewalks when the park 
closes at 11:30 p.m. 
  Jeremiah Tattersall, 25, an Occupy Gainesville partici-
pant, said members of the movement plan to go before the 
Gainesville City Commission on Thursday during citizen comment to ask to stay on the plaza after the park closes.
  The Gainesville movement is a local branch of the Occu-py Wall Street movement, which has spread to cities across the globe, including Hong Kong, London and Toronto. 
  “We have a permanent occupation happening,” said Tat-
tersall, who is a delegate from the North Central Florida Central Labor Council. “A lot of people are angry.”
  Ellas Anthony McDaniel, the 56-year-old son of rhythm 
and blues singer Bo Diddley, said he plans to stay involved with the movement and has other plans in motion. McDan-
iel was arrested at 12:01 Friday morning for trespassing for 
staying on the plaza after public hours ended.
  His arrest attracted attention from the The Guardian, a 
British daily newspaper, and Spinner.com, which is owned 
by AOL Music.
  Prior to the arrest, Gainesville Police Department ofﬁ  cers 
told the protesters that the park would close at 11:30 p.m. 
and that they would be arrested if they chose to stay on the plaza past that time. 
  Ofﬁ  cers waited half an hour past the scheduled closing 
time to arrest protesters who didn’t leave the plaza.
  McDaniel was approached by an ofﬁ  cer around mid-
night. 
  He was handcuffed, taken to a police car, given a notice 
to appear in court and released. 
  The notice counts as an arrest, but he was not taken to    Occupy Gainesville gains momentum, international attention

Oct. 19, 1967: While eating candy bars from a

student discover caterpillars inside the candy bars. Upon investigation, insects are found to reside inside or near vending machines. UF officials say there’s no 
rule on how long candy can be kept inside vending 
machines.
Oct. 18, 1973: Eleven percent of UF students vote 
on the future of Student Government for the first time in UF history. Forty-six percent of the 2,892 students who vote want to abolish SG, while the remaining 54 percent want to either restructure SG or keep it the way it is.
Oct. 19, 1981: Hume Hall is declared the “Hume 
River” by students after the ground-floor of the build-ing flash floods twice in a week. Students are unable to use the bathroom. UF officials say there’s not much they can do to help residents.

The Friends of the Library book 
sale is expected to kick off this week-
end with the largest stock the sale has had in its 57-year history.
Billie Staff, co-chair of the sale, said 
there will be about 25 percent more items at this sale than at last fall’s sale. She estimated there would be more than 300,000 items, including books, magazines and vinyl records.Beverly Bartlett, treasurer of 
Friends of the Library, said the extra 
donations may help the nonprofit 
organization raise more money than usual for the Alachua County library system.
“It comes at a good time,” she said. 
“The more we can do to help, the bet-ter.”
She said the extra donations will 
be especially helpful in a time when 
state funding is a constant uncertain-
ty due to potential budget cuts.The Friends of the Library has 
pledged $170,000 from this sale to the 
county library system, Bartlett said. 
The nonprofit also helps the library system by funding scholarships and small projects.
The nonprofit raised about 
$147,000 at the spring sale, not count-ing the $25,000 it costs to put on the sale each fall and spring semester, she said.
The sale will start Saturday and 
continue until Oct. 26.Book sale returns with more merchandiseDANA EDWARDS

David Parra sets up his video camera and switches 
on his lighting equipment, which shines on a black 
backdrop surrounded by painted rainbow walls. 
He, along with partners Albert Perera, a psychology 
junior at UF, and Austin Joseph, a psychology sopho-
more at Santa Fe Community College, started the video 
project “Making it Better, Love UF.”  
The UF advertising junior wants to let current and 
incoming UF lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, ques-tioning and straight students know the university is an accepting support system of individuality. 
Parra’s inspiration for the project came from “The 
Trevor Project” and “It Gets Better” campaign, which consists of YouTube videos made after the increase in 
high school and college student suicides in fall 2010. 
The student-made video is meant to send a proactive 
message, rather than one of just hope. 
“We don’t want people to just wait around for things to get better on their own,” said Lauren Hannahs, as-
sistant director of Multicultural and Diversity Affairs 
at UF and adviser for the project. “We want viewers to 
help themselves by advocating and giving a voice to those just like them. It’s a more active message.”
Roughly 22 graduate and undergraduate students at 
UF have shared their stories on camera. 
Parra will edit these interviews for the Human 
Rights Council of North Central Florida film screening on Thursday, which will take place at the Pride Center at 3131 NW 13th St. 
The event is part of Gainesville’s Pride Days, which 
started Friday. 
Parra and Hannahs hope to show the video clip at 
Gator Growl in a large university context in addition to posting it on YouTube on Thursday.Students to debut LGBTQ video project

Harold Saive sat in his War Room 
and said he wants to shake up the 
City Commission.
An American flag flies at full 
staff in the front yard. A black trash-
can with a “9-11 was an inside job” 
bumper sticker on it stands next to his gravel driveway . A lawn sign in his yard reads, “Support the troops. Bring them home.”
As a veteran, 67-year-old Saive 
said he wants to protect the liberties at home that U.S. soldiers fought for abroad. 
His wood-paneled War Room is 
furnished with a rectangular meet-ing table covered with books such as “Birds of Florida” and “The Crea-ture from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve.”
There, he prepares to run for the 
At-Large 1 seat of the Gainesville City Commission. He is one of six 
candidates.
He said a democratic process is 
essential to a democratic society , 
and he said he believes Gainesville’s government has been muddled by too many voices and too little com-munity outreach.
“I’ve earned the right to fight 
[for our democratic process],” Saive 
said. 
If elected, he wants to cut the size 
of the commission from seven mem-
bers to five members. He said he’d do that by having a referendum vote so the voters can decide which seats, 
if any , they’d like to see eliminated. 
If he had to choose, he said he’d pick one At-Large seat — his own, if nec-essary — to get cut.He said he’d hold monthly town 
hall meetings, which he calls “power meetings,” where residents can talk for as long as they’d like about the issues in their community.
He said he’d like to look into con-
solidating the Gainesville City Com-mission and the Alachua County Commission. He pointed to Miami-Dade County and Duval County as 
examples. Those counties use  con-
solidated governments to make de-cisions for Jacksonville and Miami.
He said he disagrees with the 
biomass plan and how the city has dealt with the Cabot Koppers Su-perfund site. He said he wants to use city lobbyists to persuade Con-gress to stop using local money to 
fund the military.
“Everybody’s hiding behind 
their budget for the inaction they 
perform,” Saive said.
Born in St. Petersburg, he moved 
to Miami when he was 5. 
His family relocated to New York 
when he was 10 because his dad got a job as a flight dispatcher at John F. 
Kennedy International Airport. He 
attended Public School 54 in Queens before his family moved back to Mi-ami two years later.
He moved back to Queens when 
he was in his late teens to attend a technical school.
It was the early 1960s, and the 
Vietnam War was heating up.
Rather than wait to get drafted, 
he said, he earned A’s and enlisted in the Air Force. His high grades al-lowed him to choose how he wanted 
to serve in the Air Force.
He chose the medical field.
From 1962 to 1966, he said, he 
served in New Mexico and the Son-drestrom Air Base in Greenland as 
an operating room technician.
Later, he used his knowledge of 
electronics and medicine to work at 
Mt. Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. He went on to work at the Miami Heart Institute as an imaging specialist. It was his job to develop the film from MRIs and other tests.
He’s since retired, run for a com-
mission seat twice and volunteered at the National Hurricane Center as 
a ham radio operator.
He ran for a seat on the Gainesville 
City Commission in 2002 and 2004.
He said he lost the first race be-
cause of inexperience, and he used 
the second race to get attention for a wetlands issue he was working on.
This race will be different, he 
said, because he knows what he’s 
doing and is serious about winning.“This is going to be a 24/7, 24/7 
obligation,” Saive said.
He went before the commission 
at the Oct. 6 meeting and announced 
his candidacy.
He stood before the seven com-
missioners and said he expected to be sitting among them soon.
“I’m here to occupy the 
Gainesville City Commission,” he 
said.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2011

� THE BACTERIA NATURALLY OCCURS IN REEFS.
MARY ANNE EADES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Researchers at UF and the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sara-
sota have discovered that bacteria natural to coral are capable 
of slowing  a white pox disease that plagues many Florida coral reefs.
“The white pox disease eats away at the coral tissue and 
leaves behind only a skeleton,” said Cory Krediet, 27, one of the researchers and a Ph.D. candidate in interdisciplinary ecol-ogy. 
The disease is caused by a pathogen known as serratia marc-
escems that attacks when defenses are weak, Krediet said.The pathogen originates from mistreated sewage runoff. 
Researchers studied how the pathogen colonizes on the coral 
and how to prevent it from spreading.
Because real coral is difficult to grow 
in a lab, researchers used a coral mod-
el during the experiment, Krediet said.  
Researchers discovered that high doses of the natural bacteria can slow white pox but not cure the disease altogether. 
“It’s hugely significant, but people have 
a hard time grasping that you can’t go from 
basic research to applied research,” said Kim Ritchie, senior scientist and manager for the 
Center for Coral Reef Research at Mote Marine Laboratory.  
“It’s never really been shown [before] that a bacteria can help prevent a disease in coral,” Ritchie added.Nothing can be done to coral already infected in Florida’s 
reefs, but the researchers can pre-treat coral that will be trans-
planted into the reef.
However, no implementation has been discovered to intro-
duce the bacteria into the reefs. 
“We can’t use the bacteria like we would an antibiotic be-
cause while it may be beneficial to the coral, we have no idea 
how it would affect all the other organisms on the reef,” Kredi-et said.
“Right now, I hesitate to say that we are anywhere close 
to the application part,” Krediet said. “The bacteria are capa-
ble of slowing the progression of white pox, but we are still 
very young in understanding the dynamic interactions on the reef.”
Sales of specialty “Protect our Reefs” license plates that cost 
$25 annually primarily funded the research.Researchers study bacteria that slows coral-destroying disease

Anthropology senior Stephen White 
spent the summer working with a ministry in Paris, but he had one main dilemma: He didn’t speak French very well.
Now, he wants to help other students 
learn the language.
CRU, originally called the Campus Cru-
sade for Christ, recently created a French club aimed at helping students learn French culture and language, with an emphasis on a partnership with Agape House World-Wide Ministries in Paris.
“I noticed how some of those with me were struggling with grasping the language and some cultural norms,” White said. “I just felt that I would be able to take my ex-periences there and help those who want to 
go to France for the purpose of missions or 
even vacation.”
The club was originally created for CRU 
members who had spent the summer in Paris with White but also aims to help stu-dents who plan to visit France in the future, especially as part of the exchange trip with Agape.
“Our main focus is to prepare students 
to encounter, experience and express the love of Christ here and in Paris,” White said. “That’s what CRU is about, that’s what our partnership is about, and that’s what the French club is about.”
Leading the meetings are students who 
spent last year in Paris and are “near fluent 
in French,” White said, as well as those who 
spent last summer in Paris with CRU.
“The club can help me relate to the peo-
ple, not just by language but by culture and being able to view and experience things from their perspective,” said Christian Col-lins, a math senior who plans to study in Paris next summer. 
CRU’s partnership with the ministry in 
Paris also plays a central role in the French club, White said.
“It serves to inspire those who want 
to go and helps those who have gone to continue learning French,” he said.  
Collins said he encourages students to at-tend the meetings, even if they don’t plan to participate in the exchange program.
French club meetings take place Wednes-
days at 5 p.m. in Matherly Room 251 and are 
open to the public.

Last week, Patti Wyatt 
saved $5 at Coffee Culture 
through a Groupon pur -
chase. 
She said she purchases 
deals about once or twice a month through LivingSocial 
or Groupon — indulging in 
expensive meals and spa ser -
vices that she might not oth-
erwise be able to afford.
Now, the 21-year-old ex-
ercise physiology senior will 
have another source for her 
online bargain hunting.
The University Network, 
or TUN.com, added UF to its 
growing list of college cam-
puses last week.
The New-York-based web-
site lists deals and student 
discounts for surrounding 
businesses. 
Started in 2010, TUN is 
present on about 200 campus-
es across the United States and works with about 5,500 
businesses.
Unlike companies such 
as Groupon or LivingSocial, 
TUN.com does not act as a middleman, providing one-time-only deals, but rather as an advertiser listing long-run-ning deals like happy-hour specials or student discounts.
As of Sunday evening, 
TUN.com listed about 30 businesses with discounts in 
Gainesville.
Places like Salty Dog Sa-
loon, Mother’s Pub and 101 
Cantina list their weekly drink and food specials. Oth-
ers like Alter Ego Fitness and 
Regal Cinemas list student 
prices for memberships or 
tickets.
If a business does not of-
fer any type of discount, TUN tries to negotiate with the 
owner to offer one through 
the website, spokeswoman Shannon Eberly said. 
Eberly said the website is 
beneficial in two main ways. 
First, by making students 
aware of discounts that they may not have known about 
previously, and second, by 
drawing in young customers 
to businesses.
“The main goal is to save 
students money,” she said. 
“We try to do that by connect-
ing students with the busi-
nesses in their area.”Site offers student dealsThree others were also arrested Friday
jail.
“The plans I’ve made regarding 
my arrest — I’m not sure if I want 
to speak about them because I nev-er want to alert my enemies to the 
dangers that exist in the future for them,” McDaniel said. “I am mak-
ing plans.”
Pat Fitzpatrick, 62; Ian Smith, 
43; and Annette Gilley, 58, were also given notices to appear.

State mandatory 
minimums cram jails
In our editorial Oct.10, we discussed the problems with 
federal “mandatory minimum” laws. 
Although these sentencing requirements are archaic, 
they pale in comparison to the state of Florida’s mandatory minimum laws. 
If you have ever been injured while playing sports or in 
an automobile accident, your doctor might have prescribed you Lortab, a pain killer containing about 7.5 milligrams of oxycodine.
The active ingredient in this pill is a controlled substance, 
meaning that it requires a prescription and could potentially 
land you in jail if caught using without one or if found with 
excess amounts of the drug. 
If caught with between eight and 27 Lortab tablets without 
a prescription, Florida law requires a mandatory minimum sentence of three years and a $50,000 fine for “trafficking” in 
oxycodine. Four grams, or eight pills, of Lortab is all that is 
needed to get this sentence.  Not four grams of oxycodine, 
which makes up only 0.06 grams of eight Lortab pills — just 
four grams of Lortab tablets. The other 3.94 grams of the Lort-ab pills are made up of acetaminophen, the active ingredient 
in Tylenol. 
Luckily, we are keeping these violent criminals off the 
streets. 
If caught with between 28 and 55 pills, you could face 
15 years in prison and a $100,000 fine; That’s 30 years and a 
$500,000 fine if caught with more than 56 pills. 
That’s 30 years in prison for possession of pain killers. 
The state does not even have to prove that you intended to distribute these pills nor are defendants allowed to say that 
they were unaware of the illegality of the substance they pos-
sessed. 
Republican Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff has been trying to abol-
ish mandatory minimums in Florida but has failed because 
politicians fear they will look “weak on crime.” 
Like federal drug laws, these laws in Florida have been 
overpopulating prisons with non-violent drug users. 
While the subject of drug use is still a matter of debate, 
surely no one can say that these laws are helping to end use of illegal substances. How can anyone say that putting someone 
in jail for 15 years for possessing otherwise legal pain killers 
is a rational sentence? 
What is the purpose of prison? We put nonviolent offenders in jail, surrounded by rap-
ists and murderers, for years only to be released to commit 
violent crimes.
The facts show that our current policies are weak on 
crime. 
This issue goes way beyond the billions of dollars that we 
spend every year to keep people incarcerated. 
This issue represents the despicable use of human beings 
for political gain.Why the impoverished stay impoverished
Recently, a lot of attention has been paid to rising in-
come inequality in the U.S., especially among the top 1 percent of income earners. The reason for this fact 
is clear: Globalization and mass media have increased the returns to productivity, and the market has rewarded these people accordingly . 
Unfortunately, very little attention has been paid to what 
keeps the poor mired in poverty . Our own government has created a poverty trap for the bottom 40 percent of the popu-lation that will do more to keep this group poor than any 
selfish Wall Street banker.
Consider a family of 3 working to try to get ahead. They 
want to contribute to society but also want to make decisions 
that are best for their family financially. If neither parent 
works, they get a little above $30,000 a year in welfare cash 
grants and subsidies.  
Now let’s say the father gets a minimum-wage job work-
ing full time. Depending on the position, he might be able to get about $15,000 a year. The total value of this family’s 
income is now a little above $40,000 because the earned in-
come-tax credit, section 8 housing voucher, Medicaid and food stamps fully kick in. 
These policies so far have created a somewhat positive 
incentive to work. 
Contrary to popular belief, however, very few heads of 
poor households actually make the minimum wage, which is largely earned by suburban kids working at Hollister. In fact, workers above age 24 make up 47 percent of those who 
earn the minimum wage, and only 23 percent of this group 
lives in poverty. A more realistic assumption is that the main income earner of a poor family would make between $10 and $20 an hour. 
Assuming a 40 hour work week for 52 weeks a year, the 
salary of someone making $10 an hour is $20,800 and at $20 an hour it is $41,600. Around that $20,000 income level, the family’s income is maximized until it reaches about $40,000 a year in income because every additional dollar it earns is replaced by a loss in $1 worth of benefits.  If the father starts off working 
in construction as a laborer and starts at $10 an hour, he might 
acquire new skills which cause 
his wage to rise. As his income goes up, he pays more in Social Security and Medicare taxes. He 
must then start paying some fed-
eral and state income tax, and the earned income-tax credit is 
phased out. As he rises to the job of foreman, perhaps mak-ing $20 an hour, he loses food stamps, medical coverage for his family through Medicaid and completely loses his hous-ing assistance. 
In other words, his family is just as well off making $20,000 
a year as they are making $40,000 a year because of govern-ment programs. Every extra dollar in income he makes from $20,000 to $40,000 is in effect taxed at 100 percent, far higher than the top 1 percent. Why try to work harder when it makes 
no difference to your economic well-being?
Many people I speak with who support heavy expendi-
tures on governmental poverty programs say that the poor 
aren’t smart enough to get ahead in our cut-throat capitalist system. 
I would beg to differ; They can’t get ahead because they 
are indeed intelligent and realize that there is zero incentive to do any more work after the $20,000 a year level until they are average-income earners. A family whose father works 
full time is just as well off with the mother staying at home as 
it is with the mother working full time as well, assuming they both make $10 an hour. 
If Occupy Wall Street has its way, more programs de-
signed to redistribute wealth will be created, which will do 
more to stratify the impoverished condition of the bottom 40 
percent of income earners than any greedy member of the top 1 percent ever could.

Americans rarely ever pay heed to international celebra-
tions that honor the establishment of a foreign nation. On Oct. 9, the People’s Republic of China celebrated 
the centennial of the 1911 Chinese Revolution. Aside the ca-cophony of other pressing matters, this event signifies three 
important issues all Americans should be concerned with: (1) 
the upcoming Fifth Generation of leadership, (2) potential for -
eign and economic issues and (3) the future of China. 
For anyone privy to the accordance of the Chinese Constitu-
tion (or lack thereof), current General Secretary and President Hu Jintao must relinquish his positions in 2012 and 2013, re-spectively. In regards to term limitations, the Fifth Generation will succeed President Jintao and his premier, Wen Jiabao. At the nadir of his reign and influence, President Jintao appeared 
on Sunday with his predecessor, former General Secretary Ji-
ang Zemin. 
President Zemin appeared to usurp rumors of his passing 
and worsening health since he left office in 2002. The reasons are also political, both to reaffirm China internationally in its own era of prosperity and to smooth crumbling relations between old Communist loyalists of President Zemin and younger tech-nocrats of President Jintao. Currently, it is widely anticipated that First Secretary Xi Jinping will succeed President Jintao. 
If so, his reported frank and terse manner in dealing with 
domestic corruption, economic matters and foreign matters could highly shape the future of Sino-American relations for the next decade. In particular, po-tential disputes involving Taiwan, trade wars that could increase the prices of goods and services domes-tically here, U.S. naval supremacy 
in Southeast Asia, competitions in currency evaluations and investments in developing countries are simply a miniscule number of issues. 
While the legacy of President Zemin in China remains cen-
sored and reportedly mediocre, his economic contribution in both policy and philosophy is still being experienced. From the beginning of his reign in 1989 to his bowing out in 2002, the People’s Republic of China has shifted from a primarily com-mand-based Communist nation to a semi-authoritarian Com-
munist nation that has seen private enterprise on both regional 
and state fronts. Average GDP growth under President Zemin hovered above 6 percent, spelling increase per capita income gains for millions. The joining of the World Trade Organiza-tion and the establishment of firm trade relations under Presi-dent Clinton produced innumerable economic gains. In our current global atmosphere, Xi Jinping (if chosen as leader) will be unable to avoid several daunting issues: An increasing U.S. military presence challenges Chinese military capabilities in 
the region, trade wars with the U.S. over the Chinese currency 
or managing an ever increasing nation under the strain of an archaic Communist political system. We have very little to go upon from the intelligence gathered on Xi Jinping. Will he be a hardliner like some of his predecessors, increasing the strain of our relationship with China? Or will he be a moderate like President Jintao, part of a sweeping generation of consensus-building moderates? 
Perhaps all speculation must be based on some semblance 
of factual information gathered before us. If Xi Jinping does hold the dual offices of general secretary and president, his approach to domestic matters may open a window into our future. Growing environmental devastation and pollution en-danger the lives of millions of Chinese citizens. While China managed the “Great Recession” with a well-crafted stimulus package that cushioned decreased GDP quarterly growth, in-vestments will peak. Higher production costs in China have 
shifted some goods to its competitors, including Thailand, In-
dia and Singapore. 
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council estimated a 
potential jump from 5 to 9 percent in producing goods. Grow-ing social unrest from crippling gaps in income wages between agricultural farmers and blue-white-collar workers will also test the Chinese government’s ability to hold stability. There is much we have to look forward to, but any continuing of a peaceful coexistence must be factored with a pragmatic ap-
proach to China.

America must take pragmatic approach with China in futureGuest Column

Speaking Out
Alex Guilmartin made a good point 
in his Thursday column, lamenting the fact that the loud protests of the 
Occupy Wall Street movement are full of sound and fury yet signify nothing.
The protesters have garnered a lot of at-
tention while raising signs with vague proc-lamations like, “Share the Wealth,” “We are the 99%” or “Jobs for all at Union Wages.”  (I’m not even kidding about that one.) By now, you have probably seen the photo of a protester using the side of an NYPD patrol car to do his business.
Guilmartin rightly explains that anger 
itself is not enough to lift us out of our fi-nancial mess. So what could the masses of dread-locked protesters do to cause real change? Or to put it more bluntly, what re-forms would they call for if they actually knew anything about the financial system?
First, the Occupy Wall Street protest-
ers would call for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to propose a strict form of the Volcker Rule. The rule 
would limit the ability of federally insured 
banks to generate much of their revenue from proprietary trading (trading for their own account). The rule would also limit the big banks’ ability to bet on hedge-funds and private-equity funds. For years before the financial meltdown, banks had been us-ing borrowed money to make these bets, ef-fectively multiplying their gains when they 
bet correctly and their losses when they 
bet wrong. Most economists agree that this practice, along with risky derivatives trad-ing, exacerbated the financial crisis.
The second thing the protesters would call for, if they knew what they actually wanted, would be restrictions on high-frequency trading 
(HFT). In this practice, traders make thou-sands of transactions each second, buying and selling back the same stock in a matter of milliseconds, for gains of fractions of a penny. 
Regulators began to scrutinize the prac-
tice following last summer’s  infamous “flash crash” during which the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost almost 1,000 points, 
only to make up the loss soon after. Experts 
are still in dispute as to whether HFT actu-ally amplifies the market’s ups and downs. What is not in dispute is that HFT gives an unfair advantage to traders with the pow-erful and expensive computers needed to jump on tiny market opportunities so quickly. Two popular regulations are a “speed limit” on the number of trades one trader can make per second, and a mini-
mum denomination, let’s say a penny, for 
which a stock can be turned around.
Unfortunately, none of the Wall Street 
protesters are raising signs that say, “Pre-vent federally insured banks from making proprietary trades with our money,” or “Put speed limits on high frequency trad-ing activities”.
So until the protesters change their tac-
tics, I guess we’ll just have to be content with the old “defecate on a police car” ap-proach.

Sixth-grader Megan Lapcevic, 
11, dipped her paint brush into 
a Styrofoam cup and coated her 
pumpkin in a deep magenta paint.  
Rubbing the excess paint off her hands, she called her creation 
“pinkalicious.”
“I’ve made plenty of boring, or -
ange pumpkins, but this is the most 
fun one yet,” Megan said. 
UF&Shands hosted its first 
“Pink Pumpkin Painting Party” 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.  Saturday on 
the Cancer Genetics Research Com-plex lawn.
Lindy Brounley, communica-
tions director for the Shands at UF cancer center, said she wanted the event to help educate the commu-nity about breast cancer while also offering a new perspective on the disease.
“We wanted this event to be fun 
and hands on,” Brounley said. “I think we’ve achieved that goal.”
Jerry Gramig, a 49-year-old 
Gainesville resident, agreed. He, along with his wife, Lavina, and their daughter, Ellie, 11, partici-pated in the event early Saturday afternoon. Gramig lost his mother to cancer, and cancer has affected both sides of his family through the years.
“[The event is] like having a 
game with a purpose,” Gramig said. “There’s fun with learning here. People are getting the chance to show support for the cause and gaining some education without being overwhelmed.”
Brounley anticipated 100 par -
ticipants and had preordered 200 pumpkins. She said they bought additional pumpkins from Pub-lix Super Markets and Lowe’s.  
About 530 people preregistered for the event, she said. About half were children.
“That’s the real focus here,” 
Brounley said. “While this is an event for families, we really hope to bring awareness to the mothers, the aunts, the grandmothers, even the 
dads who have brought the chil-
dren out. It’s all about education, 
prevention and awareness, really.”
UF&Shands, the cancer center 
and the Climb for Cancer Founda-tion offered information packets and brochures.
Mary Lavan, a 76-year-old Gainesville resident, lost her daugh-ter to breast cancer 20 years ago.  
“This event really amazes me,” she said, placing her hand over her heart. “To see all of the youth out here, it’s overwhelming.” 8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2011

Florida Organic Growers hosted a Fair 
Food Panel on Saturday evening to kick off 
Gainesville’s observance of World Food Day on Sunday and National Food Day on Oct. 24.
The event was held at the Civic Media 
Center, an alternative library and meeting room for local activist groups, located down-town.The panel — which included farmer Jordan 
Brown from The Family Garden; Juan Concha from the Farmworker Association of Florida; Maya Garner, owner of The Jones Eastside restaurant; and Marty Mesh of the Agri-cultural Justice Project and Florida Organic Growers — provided first-hand accounts of 
the poor state of farmworker conditions and 
insight into local farms and businesses that are trying to make a difference.
This was the first time Gainesville has cel-
ebrated Food Day, and Danielle McDuffie, co-ordinator of Gainesville Food Day, has goals to make it an annual event, hoping that it will be bigger and better next year.
Food Day events will be held throughout 
the week, including the City Hall Garden Tour which starts tonight at 6 p.m. Gainesville Food Day events kicked off with panel this weekendphilAnthR opy

 MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2011  ALLIGATOR, 13
Charlie Weis calls them? They can’t 
do much without an offensive line paving the way .  
  Chris Rainey has 89 rushing 
yards  in those three games, and he 
averaged more than 100 in Florida’s 
ﬁ  rst four wins. Jeff Demps, mean-while, has been out with an ankle injury , even though Gators coaches scoffed before the season about Demps’ ability to stay healthy.
  Defensively , things aren’t going much better. 
  Will Muschamp has talked about 
a ball-hawking D since he was hired, but Florida has created zero turn-overs the last three games. 
  All things considered, the Gators’ 
defense didn’t play too bad Satur-day . Florida ﬁ  nally stopped the run, relatively speaking. And it only al-lowed one true touchdown drive.
  Auburn’s other 10 points came off 
Florida muffed punts — and Florida had four of those. But Frankie Ham-mond said after the game that the muffs by Chris Rainey and Robert Clark did not cost Florida the game.
  And he was right. The Gators 
would have still lost 7-6. 
On Florida’s second-to-last play 
of the game, the one right before Driskel was sacked from behind, the 
quarterback kept a play alive with 
his feet, scrambling in the backﬁ  eld until a receiver could get open.
  A receiver did, Jordan Reed. He 
was open, inside Auburn’s 5-yard line. Driskel ﬁ  red a laser, the type of pass that made him the best quarter-back recruit in the country last year. 
  The ball hit Reed between the numbers. Then it hit the ground.
  Reed has struggled all season, 
as has every other receiver, save for Andre Debose, and he suffered an injury in the ﬁ  rst quarter. Figures.
  Debose has been pretty much 
Florida’s whole offense the last cou-ple of weeks, catching a bomb from the quarterback (whoever that may be) and running for a 60-plus yard score. But even he has disappeared after those catches.
  That is not necessarily his fault. 
It’s everyone’s fault. The offensive line, which can’t hold blocks. The running backs, who can’t do any-thing without the offensive line. The quarterbacks, who are simply too young for this.
  Neither Jacoby Brissett nor 
Driskel cost Florida the game. They 
both played OK — not good, of 
course, but OK. At the same time, neither one helped Florida win the game. They were both just sort of there.
  It’s not their fault, necessarily . It’s 
everyone’s fault. 
  And that’s the scariest part.  Contact T yler Jett at tjett@alligator .org. 
TYLER , from page 1
Gators have worst offensive showing since ‘99 
  “The open week’s coming at a good 
time,” coach Will Muschamp said. “We’ve 
got to do a lot.”
  Chief among UF’s bye-week goals is 
getting healthy . 
  Sophomore linebacker Ronald Powell 
and senior running back Jeff Demps both missed the game with injuries. Sophomore wide receiver Andre Debose and senior guard Dan Wenger were hurt on Satur-day . Even junior kicker Caleb Sturgis was sidelined by injury , just another parallel to last year’s Mississippi State loss. 
  And that’s to say nothing of senior 
quarterback John Brantley’s ankle, which has hindered the Gators in ways few would have predicted before the season. Florida has thrown for 242 yards in the 10 quarters since Brantley was hurt on the ﬁ  -nal offensive play before halftime against Alabama. 
  Brantley has upgraded from crutches 
to a walking boot, and Muschamp is opti-
mistic he could return against Georgia. 
  “I’m hoping so,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ll see what happens. I don’t know. 
His rehab’s going very well.”
  Saturday’s loss illustrated just how 
desperately the Gators need him. Florida’s offense had only 194 yards, its lowest total since 1999, when UF had 114 against Ala-bama in the SEC Championship game. 
  Freshman Jacoby Brissett made his second consecutive start but completed just 5 of 10 passes for 45 yards before he 
was pulled at halftime.
  On his ﬁ  rst throw, Brissett dropped 
back, pumped to senior running back 
Chris Rainey on his right, hesitated and then unleashed a 54-yard bomb that was intercepted by T’Sharvan Bell. Brissett’s intended receiver, senior Deonte Thomp-son, was open if Brissett had thrown it a moment sooner. But a split-second hesita-
tion cost him.
  With the exception of a 25-yard laser 
to Frankie Hammond, Brissett was rel-
egated to mostly screens and dump offs, 
driving an offense that racked up a mere 104 yards in the ﬁ  rst half. 
  “We needed to do something different 
from what we were doing,” Muschamp said. 
“Continue to do the same stuff, you’re 
going to get the same results. ... Jacoby’s play was nothing that we were disap-pointed with. We just weren’t moving the ball effectively enough.”
  The Gators turned to Driskel, some-
thing Muschamp said they would do at 
one point or another in the game. 
  But the results were mostly the same. 
  Driskel completed 9 of his 18 attempts 
for 75 yards. He had a chance to erase Au-burn’s 7-6 lead on a trick play with 8:17 remaining in the third quarter and the ball at the Tigers’ 48-yard line, but he overshot sophomore tight end Jordan Reed, who was running wide open down the seam.
  After Driskel caught the ﬂ  ea-ﬂ  icker 
pitch from Rainey, Reed was streaking down the middle at Auburn’s 7-yard line, with sophomore Demetruce McNeal 4 yards behind in coverage. 
But Driskel’s pass landed well beyond 
Reed’s desperate grasp, and UF’s best op-portunity at the end zone was lost. 
  “It was wide open,” Muschamp said. 
“We need to hit that.”
  Both UF quarterbacks completed 
50 percent of their passes, but neither Driskel’s 4.2 yards per attempt nor Bris-sett’s 4.5 was enough to overcome a run-ning game that amassed just 66 yards. 
  “Both guys didn’t do anything that re-
ally killed us in the game, but again didn’t do enough to really help,” Muschamp 
said. 
  The loss drops Florida to 2-3 in the 
SEC, two games behind South Carolina 
and Georgia in the East division.  
  While the Gators’ goals are not yet out 
of reach, an off-week followed by a loss to the Bulldogs would almost certainly seal Florida’s fate. 
  “We could deﬁ  nitely use the bye week 
to get everybody back healthy, get every-body rested up, because we’ve got a long stretch ahead of us,” junior linebacker Jon Bostic said. “What happened, happened. So we’re just trying to get prepared for Georgia.”

AUBURN, Ala. — The 
Gators are a representation 
of first-year head coach Will Muschamp: young, emotional and undisciplined. 
On Florida’s best chance for 
a win in the past three weeks, the Gators once again took themselves out of the game with mental mistakes. They entered Saturday’s game the most penalized team in the country, and that trend contin-ued in a 17-6 loss to Auburn.
Trailing by eight points 
with less than six minutes to play in the game and facing a fourth-and-3 from their own 46, Gators’ left tackle Xavier 
Nixon was flagged for a false 
start. The penalty prevented 
Florida from attempting to go for it on fourth down and cost the team a chance at victory.
But the Gators’ defense 
stood up, holding Auburn 
and forcing a punt with 3:03 
to play. However, wide re-ceiver Robert Clark fumbled the high, booming kick and Auburn took over. 
Clark had subbed in for 
running back Chris Rainey, who had muffed three punts of his own on the evening. Florida lost two of them.
“Turnovers killed us,” Mus-
champ said. “Three turnovers lead to 10 points and really cost you the football game.”
Auburn put its first points 
of the game on the board in the first quarter after Rainey muffed a punt and Daren Bates recovered the ball at the Florida 32-yard line. 
After the play, Muschamp 
let each official have a piece of his mind for what he felt was an incorrect call. Instead of 
readying his team for a quick-
change situation, Muschamp called a timeout and spent the majority of it berating the men in black and white.
“I can’t comment on that,” 
Muschamp said of the call in question. 
Then, facing a third-and-3 
situation at the 26, Florida defensive tackle Domin-ique Easley jumped offside,                    Mistakes, penalties

AUBURN, Ala. — After coaches 
said Mike Gillislee earned himself a 
more prominent role in Florida’s of-fense, the reserve running back was largely absent from the game plan in 
the Gators’ 17-6 loss to Auburn.
Gillislee led Florida in rushing yards 
against LSU a week ago, but only car -
ried the ball three times in Jordan-Hare 
Stadium on Saturday.
“We weren’t really doing much in 
the run game, so that kind of dictated (Gillislee’s workload),” coach Will Muschamp said. “We felt like we need-
ed to open up a little more and work 
the perimeter. But we did have some read series runs where he was a part of that and didn’t get the ball.”
For the night, Florida rushed the 
ball 30 times for just 66 yards — the second time in three games the Gators have been held under 100 yards on the ground.
Running back Chris Rainey shoul-
dered the load against Auburn, carry-ing it 16 times for 33 yards. Three times 
he was hit in the backfield for a loss, 
and three other times 
he was stopped for no 
gain. Gillislee racked up 16 yards on his three carries.
Injuries: Games 
aren’t the only things Florida has lost in 
October; the team has 
also been ravaged by 
injuries the last three weeks.
Florida played without Ronald 
Powell, who left the LSU game with an undisclosed injury, and running back Jeff Demps. Gillislee not featured as 
run game struggles again � UF HAS MINUS-7 TAKEAWAY MARGIN.

AUBURN, Ala. — Thirteen and a half 
quarters.
That’s how long it has been since Florida’s 
defense last got its hands on the ball.
For the third straight game, the Gators 
failed to force a turnover. And for the third 
week in a row, Florida found itself in the loss 
column, this time falling 17-6 to Auburn.
“It’s tough to win a game (when you lose 
the turnover battle),” coach Will Muschamp 
said. “That’s three games we haven’t gotten a turnover.”
Muschamp and defensive coordinator 
Dan Quinn preached the importance of turn-over margin throughout preseason camp. But seven games into the season, the Gators are losing that battle big time.
Florida hasn’t forced a turnover in 203 
minutes, as its last came in the Kentucky game on Sept. 24, when backup linebacker Michael Taylor picked off a Morgan Newton pass in the third quarter.
Now, three weeks and zero takeaways 
later, the Gators are tied with the Wildcats for the worst turnover margin in the confer -
ence at minus-7. During that span Florida has turned the ball over six times, including 
three Saturday against Auburn.
Freshman Jacoby Brissett threw an inter -
ception on the Gators’ 
second play from scrimmage for the first 
giveaway. Then Chris 
Rainey and Robert Clark each muffed a punt 
that was recovered by the Tigers. 
Rainey’s turnover in the first quarter set 
up Auburn’s first touchdown, and Clark’s giveaway happened with three minutes left in the game to dash any hope the Gators had of beating the Tigers in Auburn for the first time since 1999.
While Florida had issues giving the ball 
away, Auburn was able to protect it like Ala-bama and LSU did against UF.Florida defense fails to force

Trotter to make one of his few plays of the game. Trotter tossed up a jump ball in the end zone to DeAngelo Benton, who came down with the pass over cornerback 
Cody Riggs for the Tigers’ only points of 
the first half and what amounted to be the game-winning points.
Also, Florida committed five penalties 
for 35 yards in the first half, and again, the flags came on procedural issues that Muschamp and other coaches insisted would not be tolerated after last week’s loss to LSU.
“We need to do a better job coaching, 
because, obviously, it’s not getting done and we’ve got to look at some other guys that can play,” Muschamp said. “That 
falls on my shoulders — nobody else’s.”
Florida had two false 
start penalties and two offsides calls in the first 
half, and set Auburn up 
for two scoring drives 
by virtue of penalty. Defensive tackles Jaye Howard and Leon Orr 
were called for a face mask and offsides penalty, respectively. Both flags came on third down, extending the Tigers’ drive.
But Auburn kicker Cody Parkey bailed 
out the Gators by missing field goal at-tempts from 42 and 45 yards.
After being called for six flags in all, 
Florida remains the most penalized team in the nation with 61 for 465 yards. 
“We’ll figure out a different way to 
emphasize it and do a better job with it,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s all I can say.”
Contact Matt Watts at mwatts@alligator.
org.Although Muschamp said 
last week that everyone except 
quarterback John Brantley and cornerback Jeremy Brown would be ready for the game, he said after the loss that Pow-ell did not practice all week. 
Muschamp said he expects 
Powell, who has struggled to produce at times this season, to be ready for the Georgia game following the bye week. Senior William Green started in place of Powell, assisting on one tackle and notching two quarterback hurries. 
Demps was listed as a 
game-time decision after spraining his ankle on a kick return against Alabama.
“We didn’t feel like he was 
f u l l s p e e d 
enough,” Muschamp said. “He 
practiced some this week. Not 
much.”
Starting left guard Dan 
Wenger was on crutches with his left foot in a protective boot after the game, and kicker Ca-leb Sturgis injured his leg in the first half.
Wide receiver Andre De-
bose tweaked his ankle during Florida’s first offensive series and played sparingly the re-mainder of the game.
Wide receiver issues: Mus-
champ fielded questions re-garding his struggling wide receiver corps after the game. 
No receiver on the Gators’ 
roster averages two receptions per game, and the team’s two leading receivers are Rainey (18 catches) and fullback Trey Burton (13 catches). Against Auburn, Florida’s leading re-ceiver had 40 yards.
“That’s the biggest issue 
right now, just consistent play at the position,” Mus-champ said. “We’re not get-ting enough consistent play at the position. I’m not going to get into a bashing of one posi-tion.”

Linebacker Jelani Jenkins (bottom) dropped an interception in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s 17-6 loss 
at Auburn. Florida hasn’t forced a turnover since the second half against Kentucky on Sept. 24. 
Jenkins drops another 
interception in fourth
Part of UF’s problem the last 
three games has been that oppo-
nents have run the ball 135 times 
and passed it just 55. Florida has 
had trouble stopping the run and stripping the ball from carriers, but it has also struggled with a 
consistent pass rush and failed 
to capitalize on the few mistakes teams have made throwing the ball.
It was the same story Saturday, 
as the Gators failed to force a fum-ble against the Tigers, recorded just one sack and were unable to come through on at least two in-
terception opportunities.
On Auburn’s first drive of the 
second half, Florida freshman cor -
nerback Marcus Roberson was in 
the vicinity of an errant Clint Mo-
seley pass, but Roberson slipped 
and was unable to corral the ball from his back.Then in the fourth quarter, with 
Florida trailing 14-6, linebacker Jelani Jenkins jumped in front of a Moseley pass near midfield 
and dropped a sure interception 
that would have given the Gators prime field position with a chance to attempt to tie the game late.
“We haven’t created any turn-
overs,” defensive tackle Jaye How-ard said. “Whenever we do create 
turnovers it looks good for the 
Gators. We’re putting our offense in good field position. We haven’t been getting it, and we have to get back to playing our style of de-
fense and causing havoc and just 
disrupting the quarterback.”

Florida dominated Mississippi 
State for 89 minutes on Sunday.  
Unfortunately for UF, it was one 
minute too few.
A first-minute goal by the Bull-
dogs (5-8-3, 2-5-1 Southeastern Conference) was all they needed as the No. 11 Gators (13-4, 6-2 SEC) were unable to convert on a multi-tude of scoring chances in a 1-0 loss on Sunday in Starkville, Miss.
Thirty-seven seconds into the 
game, freshman midfielder Amy Hoover intercepted a pass at mid-
field.  She placed a through ball past 
the Gators’ back line to sophomore forward Elisabeth Sullivan, who was making a run into the box. Sul-livan then fired it past keeper Tay-lor Burke from 16 yards out.
Gators coach Becky Burleigh 
said Sullivan’s goal, which was the second-fastest goal in Mississippi 
State history, was a confidence 
booster for the Bulldogs, who came into the game ahead of only Ole Miss in the SEC standings.
It was the second win for the 
Bulldogs in 13 games against the Gators, a series in which Mississip-pi State has been outscored 53-6.
Florida had plenty of chances 
following the goal, with four shots in the next 14 minutes. Three of the attempts were on frame, but Mis-sissippi State redshirt junior keeper Skylar Rosson saved each of the shots.
“I think we handled it well,” 
Burleigh said of her team’s early deficit. “Nobody panicked.  No-body was getting too riled up about it.  We just had a lot of opportuni-ties and we didn’t finish.”
The chances kept coming for the 
Gators, who had 12 first-half shots to the Bulldogs’ five, but Rosson continued to stonewall them.
In the 43rd minute, midfielder 
Taylor Travis drilled a shot from 25 yards out that traveled toward the top of the net before Rosson 
jumped up and got a hand on it to tip it out of bounds.
With 18 seconds left in the first 
half, Florida center back Kat Wil-liamson played a free kick into the Mississippi State box that mid-fielder Caroline Triglia headed, but it was stopped by a diving Rosson, who finished the game with 13 saves.
“She made some good saves, 
and we kicked a few right at her, 
which didn’t help,” Burleigh said.
The Gators continued to squan-
der opportunities in the second 
half, as they added 12 more shots but were unable to convert.“If we learned anything, it’s 
that you have to come out ready to play,” Burleigh said. “Everybody on the field needs to be ready to play.
“Can’t give up a goal in the 
first minute. [Assistant coach Alan Kirkup] said after the game, ‘You can’t win the game in the first five 
minutes, but you can lose it,’ and 
that’s pretty much what we did to-day.”16, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2011
