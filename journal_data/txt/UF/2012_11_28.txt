� LETTERS TO SANTA 
WILL BE COLLECTED UNTIL DEC. 12 FOR OPERATION LETTERS TO SANTA.

As the holiday season 
draws near, children draft 
their wish lists, and Santa 
Claus wants to hear from ev-
ery Gainesville girl and boy.
The City of Gainesville 
Department of Parks, Rec-
reation and Cultural Affairs 
will collect letters until Dec. 12 for Operation Letters to Santa, and every letter will 
receive a response. 
People can drop off let-
ters at Eastside Community 
Center, Clarence R. Kelly 
Community Center, Porter 
Community Center and the Albert “Ray” Massey Recre-ation Center.
The program usually re-
ceives about 200 to 300 let-ters, said Shannon Keleher, recreation manager at the Department of Parks, Recre-
ations and Cultural Affairs.
Keleher said this program 
is one of the ways the depart-
ment encourages children to 
practice their writing skills.
“It will help them learn 
to communicate effectively,” 
Keleher said. 
Mostly children between 5 years old and 8 years old send 
letters.
Keleher said writing the 
letters can also be good prac-tice for the FCAT.
Katharine Forbes, market-
ing technician for the depart-ment, said the letters tie into the city’s youth programs character-building curricu-lum.
Each child who writes a 
letter should include two of 
his or her accomplishments, Forbes said, because the de-partment wants to show that 
children in Gainesville are 
talented and special. 
It’s important for the 
children to know that Santa 
Claus wants to hear all about 
them, she added.
Other requirements in-
clude name, age, gender, three wishes to Santa Claus 
and a return address.
While the department 
isn’t distributing gifts, San-
ta’s response letters will be 
personalized to each child, 
signed and sealed with wax.
“They’ll have something 
to post to their refrigerator,” Forbes said.
Letters can also be faxed 
to 352-334-3299 or mailed to:

A Gainesville woman was arrest-
ed late Monday night when agents 
from the Drug Enforcement Admin-istration found 25 marijuana plants and about two pounds of marijuana 
in her house.
Agents arrested Holly Rae Beau-
vais, 37, of 3608 NW 136th St., after several months of investigation.
In August, Gainesville’s DEA of-
ﬁ  ce received calls about some men 
who would show up at the house on 136th Street for about an hour each day . The callers said they suspected criminal activity.
For two months, DEA agents 
surveyed the house and noted the utility bills were in Beauvais’ name. During the stake-
out, it appeared as if no one continu-ously lived in the house, according to a report from the DEA.
They also 
observed Frank 
Lineberger, Beauvais’ brother, fre-quent the house and purchase timers and electrical equipment at Lowe’s.
The agents believed the equip-
ment was used to grow marijuana inside the house, according to the report.
On Monday , agents met with 
Lineberger at the house, where they 
reported smelling marijuana and 
hearing air conditioning units and fans run inside, according to the re-port.
The agents asked Lineberger if 
they could search his house, but he refused.
Later, an agent called Beauvais 
at work and asked her if she had “more than 100 marijuana plants” in 
her house.

In a war spotted with lawsuits 
and bankruptcy, Gainesville tutor-
ing service TutoringZone is surviv-
ing by reorganization.
After grappling with eviction, 
TutoringZone founder Matt Hintze said the transition from a defunct TutoringZone to a new Tutoring-
Zone is seamless in terms of services 
to students. The original service is going out of business and will close 
in nine months to reopen under the 
same name.“It’s all behind the scenes,” Hin-
tze said.
TutoringZone began to face le-
gal issues when investors’ money 
couldn’t be paid and the company’s 
location on North Main Street was evicted in August after failure to 
pay rent for several months.
TutoringZone General Manager 
Alek Hartzog said the new Tutor-ingZone is expanding its online 
presence in its new studio space at New Horizons Computer Learning 
Centers. He said this semester was 
successful and the company’s over-all expenses decreased.“We’re deﬁ  nitely not going any-
where anytime soon,” Hartzog said.
TutoringZone and Study Edge 
have been ﬁ  erce competitors in the 
market since nine TutoringZone em-
ployees left the company to create Study Edge a year and a half ago.
One of those nine was Ethan 
Fieldman, president and co-founder of Study Edge. Fieldman, who used 
to own 50 percent of TutoringZone 
as a co-founder with Hintze, said the two split as business partners 
because of disagreements about TutoringZone survives after conﬂ  ict

◗THE EXPANSION WILL OPEN 
IN MID-JANUARY.
EMILY PADGETT
Alligator Contributing Writer
At CYM Coffee Co., the mis-
sion is about more than just coffee. 
The personal growth workshop company-turned-coffee shop will soon get more room to grow that 
mission.
CYM Coffee Co., in the Green 
Market Plaza at 5402 NW Eighth 
Ave., will expand into the adjacent building. The expansion will have more seating and will include a food, gift and garden shop.
The CYM philosophy is about 
supporting local communities and 
products, promoting education 
and being environmentally friend-ly, said Dave Neal, senior director of Cymplify, which is the umbrella name for the CYM businesses.
CYM Central, which will in-
clude CYM Coffee Co., the store and Cymple Gardens, will open in mid-January, he said.
CYM stands for “Change Your 
Mind,” which comes from the title of a Sister Hazel song. Ken Block, Sister Hazel lead singer, is part of 
the Cymplify team.
The CYM businesses began 
with “Change Your Mind” per-
sonal growth workshops. Block, who has a master’s degree in coun-seling, and Neal, who said he has a background in corporate train-ing, began putting on the two-day workshops in 2010.
The two expanded the CYM 
brand when Neal’s brother Brad Neal opened the coffee shop.
Beginning Dec. 13, customers 
can preview the expansion. There will be tours of the new space for the 12 days leading up to Christ-mas. By January, the store will have its own space and will sell coffee, 
chocolate and local products.
Gardener’s Edge, the existing 
business next door, will be re-
named Cymple Gardens.
The expansion has been in the 
works since June, he said, when more than 1,000 people attended the coffee shop’s grand opening.
“The turnout for our grand 
opening was so good that we looked at the building next door that day,” Dave Neal said.

Jenny Squires usually teaches 
Zumba in the Student Recreation 
& Fitness Center, but Tuesday 
she taught it on the North Lawn.
The Zumba ﬁ  tness class, 
which raised about $60 for the 
Children’s Miracle Network, was 
part of an Inter-Residence Hall 
Association and Phi Sigma Pi fraternity fundraiser for Dance Marathon.
“Dance Marathon is all 
about dancing, so we thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be a great thing to do as a fundraiser?’” Squires said.
Students who participated 
in the class gave a donation and ﬁ  lled out a waiver. 
About 10 students participated 
in the 3 p.m. class on the lawn.
Squires, a 20-year-old dance 
junior who plans to pursue phys-ical therapy, has taught Zumba for more than a year.
“I love dancing, being in shape, 
and I want to show that passion 
to everyone else who participates 
in my classes,” she said.Squires also mentioned it was 
harder to do Zumba outside.
She said almost 50 people 
joined the Facebook event, and some of her regulars took part Tuesday.
The music for the event ranged 
from radio station hits to Zumba 
ﬁ  tness music, which Squires said 
she’s required to use.
“We have to use 70 percent of 
that copyrighted music, in order 
to be considered a Zumba class,” she said.
The class was a new experi-
ence for Phi Sigma Pi delegate Jil-lian Sullivan, 21, but the biology 
and psychology senior jumped in with the other attendees.
“Being outside is different 
than being in a gym,” she said.
The proﬁ  ts raised for the event 
will be split between the two groups for their Dance Marathon individual totals. Zumba class moves outdoors to raise money for Dance MarathonCAMPUSLocal coffee shop expanding to add food, gift, garden shop

A new Provisions on Demand 
Market took Quiznos’ place in the 
Hub.
The recently opened P .O.D. 
Market location could help allevi-ate the long lines that congest the Hub, Marketing Program Man-
ager for Gator Dining Services Jill 
Rodriguez wrote in an email.
“In addition to offering another 
food option on campus, the P .O.D. Market will provide convenience 
and quick service in one of the bus-
iest parts of campus,” she said.
The P .O.D Market construction 
lasted two months and resulted 
in Gator Dining hiring three new 
employees.
Rodriguez declined to comment 
on how much the addition cost.
Selling products like sandwich-
es, sushi and salads, the P .O.D. Market offers some variety to Hub dining options, said journalism ju-nior Ali Petsopoulos, 20.
“For something different than 
Chick-fil-A and Einstein’s, I would 
definitely buy something from there,” she said.
But Rebecca Snead, a 22-year-
old sports management senior, 
said she didn’t think she would 
use the new P .O.D. Market.
Snead, who spends time in the 
Hub almost every day, said the prices will keep her away.
“If I am in desperate need for 
food, I will,” she said. “But I can 
wait the two hours between classes and eat the chips at home that are 
twice the size and half the price.”
The P .O.D. Market in the Hub 
is open from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Monday through Thursday and 
until 6 p.m. Friday.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 2012

Fourteen pieces of artwork from 17 stu-
dents and alumni will be featured in UF’s 
“Codified II: Art + Genetics” exhibit, which opens with a reception at 3:30 p.m. today on the third floor of UF’s Cancer and Genetics 
Research Complex.
“There is a good cross section of art from 
sculpture, painting and drawing to videos 
and live performance,” said Bryan Yeager, ex-hibit coordinator. “It’s a wide spectrum — not just your typical painting.”Winning artists will be announced at 4 
p.m. Four pieces of artwork will be selected for awards that include cash prizes.
Melding the worlds of genetics and art is 
not a new concept, but Richard Heipp, interim director of UF’s School of Art and Art History , said the Genetics Institute was leery at first.
The first “Codified,” which was in con-
junction with the 2011 Florida Genetics Sym-posium, was well received.
“Curiosity and inquiry isn’t discipline 
based,” Heipp said. “The sense is that this cross pollination happened across campus.”
This year, the Genetics Institute contribut-ed $6,000 from its symposium budget to fully fund the exhibit. These funds were divided 
between fabrication grants for artists, logistical exhibit costs and award money , Heipp said.
David Tonnelier, a 21-
year-old sculpture senior, created a 3D depiction of 
meiosis, the splitting of a cell. He said he was inspired by the lack of 3D represen-
tations of biological processes in science.
Tonnelier used Adobe Illustrator, a laser cutter, industrial foam and plaster to create his sculpture, which is 30 inches tall and 14 inches wide.
Associate director of UF’s Genetics Insti-
tute Connie Mulligan said her favorite part of the exhibit is the artists’ statements posted near each piece.
“It’s like a peek into the artists’ head,” 
she said. “I just see it as linking two fields that people would traditionally see as so far apart.”
“Codified II: Art + Genetics” is free and 
will be open to the public from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays through Jan. 22.
Exhibit uses mixed media to connect worlds of art, science

If you haven’t already post-
ed a status about keeping con-
trol of everything you’ve post-ed on Facebook, don’t bother.
The trending status claims 
users’ copyrights for the in-formation they’ve shared on Facebook and requires written consent from the user before Facebook can use the material.
Clay Calvert, UF journal-
ism professor and director of the Marion B. Brechner First Amendment Project, said the status won’t help users, be-cause the issue is a matter of contract law.
“This is much more of a 
symbolic protest than one that has any legal effect, despite what people would like to believe or think they know,” Calvert said.
When setting up an account 
with Facebook, people must ac-cept the terms of service. These 
terms state Facebook has the 
right to use the information shared on the site.
According to Facebook’s 
policy, the site can disclose in-formation to advertisers to in-fluence which ads are directed to the user. Information associ-ated with an account may be 
kept after that account is de-
leted, also.
The Facebook Statement of 
Rights and Responsibilities “is our terms of service that gov-erns our relationship with us-ers.” A status update cannot trump the terms of service that each user agreed to when sign-ing up for the site, Calvert said.
It’s like leasing a car, he said. 
When you’ve signed, you’re bound by that lease. You can’t negotiate the terms by putting a sticker on it claiming your rights after you’ve signed the contract.
“The big picture is that Face-
book users did not realize that they were giving away their rights,” Calvert said.
Some students said they 
weren’t aware how much in-formation Facebook could give away because they didn’t read the privacy policy.
Kayla Marcus, a 19-year-old 
dance freshman, said it’s scary how much information can be given out based on the policy.
“It’s just become our every-
day way of communicating,” Marcus said. “We don’t realize it’s so public.”    Trending privacy

She was charged with third-degree felonies
“No, there aren’t that many,” Beauvais said, ac-
cording to the report.
Beauvais also said she was responsible for the 
plants.
A DEA source informed about the investigation 
said agents usually ask about the amount of mari-
juana plants in a person’s house because it could mean the difference between state or federal pros-ecution.The agents returned to the house with a search 
warrant, seized the marijuana and arrested Beauvais at 11:45 p.m. She was charged with marijuana dis-tribution and possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana, both third-degree felonies, according to the Alachua County Clerk of the Courts’ website.
The DEA official said no other person was arrest-
ed in connection to the drug bust “at this time.”
Beauvais was booked into the Alachua County 
Jail at 2 a.m. Tuesday, where she remained with a $5,000 bond, according to a jail official.

Hintze said the new TutoringZone has no debt or fixed cost
management and TutoringZone’s 
far location from campus.
The original TutoringZone filed 
for bankruptcy Nov . 1. According to the bankruptcy file, Hintze owes 
$2.6 million over the course of five 
years.
The transition, which began ear -ly in the summer, includes a change in ownership. UF business professor Christopher James replaced Hintze 
as owner Aug. 15.
Hintze said the new Tutoring-
Zone has no debt or fixed cost and is well-funded.
TutoringZone’s issues were made 
public after large black-and-white posters printed with “TutoringZone is bankrupt” 
were plastered 
on campus bul-letin boards with 
a website tagged 
at the bottom: Tu-toringZoneEvict-
ed.com.
The website 
has PDF downloads of the bank-ruptcy file along with Tutoring-Zone’s former landlord’s lawsuit, an 
investor’s lawsuit and a writ of pos-session for TutoringZone’s lease.
The website, which has a viewer 
counter, has more than 5,300 views.
Fieldman denied making the 
website and putting up the posters.
“Study Edge is not interested in 
putting up websites about Tutoring-Zone’s problem,” Fieldman said. “If Study Edge wasn’t around, would TutoringZone be bankrupt? Prob-
ably not.”
Hartzog believes Study Edge is 
responsible for the posters, website and paid Facebook ads.
“Who else would care except 
Study Edge?” Hartzog said.

The room in the makeshift ani-
mal shelter was a mess.
Dawn Fox, a Gainesville vol-
unteer, made her way through a 
walkway carved through the clutter 
of the home-based shelter, curious 
about the often-closed back room she assumed was for storage.
Papers lay on countertops as 
if someone had thrown them like confetti, and old supplies of animal feed slumped in corners.
The room was filled with boxes. 
When Fox opened one of them, 
what she found almost took her 
breath away.
Inside almost all of the boxes lay 
barely moving baby squirrels, rac-coons and other wildlife.
She scooped up an infant rac-
coon she was certain was dead, but it began to twitch in her hand.
“I couldn’t believe it,” she said, 
holding back tears. “It was cold. It was smelly. And when I picked it up, it started cooing and crying.”
Fox had been volunteering at 
local wildlife rehabilitator Leslie Straub’s Gainesville house for about two months when she made the grisly discovery.
Both the State Attorney’s Office 
and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission charged Straub with a total of 24 wildlife re-
habilitation violations.
She could face a three-year sus-
pended wildlife rehabilitation li-
cense for the charges. 
Straub said the charges took her 
by surprise, especially because she was inspected before without issue and cooperated with the state. 
She said she received many more 
injured animals than usual this year, especially during the summer when Tropical Storm Debby passed through the area.
“It was a perfect storm,” Straub 
said. “All of your energy is spent dealing with this influx of animals. Your normal routine is thrown off.”
She said she usually gets an in-
flux of baby animals during spring and summer. The larger number of 
animals makes it more difficult to 
clean all of the animals’ spaces.
But investigators with the Flor -
ida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-tion Commission found more than messy cages. They charged Straub with 23 violations such as unsani-tary conditions, caging violations and neglect. The State Attorney’s 
Office charged her with one count 
of maintaining wildlife in unsani-tary conditions.
Kenneth Holmes, an investiga-
tor with the Florida Fish and Wild-life Conservation Commission, said he’s known Straub for years and that she used to be the go-to person 
to assist with in-
jured wildlife.
“She started 
rehabbing out of 
her house, and it basically con-sumed her,” Hol-mes said. “She’s a very intelligent person, and she 
knows her stuff with rehab. She just wasn’t following through with what she knew.”
During her time volunteering at 
Straub’s house, Fox saw half-dead animals living in filthy cages, she said.
One creature still sticks out in 
her mind.
It was a barred owl with dark 
charcoal feathers dotted with ashy grey flecks.
Fox said she walked into the 
bathroom one day and found the owl in the bathtub, surrounded by its own feces.
“When you would walk in to 
where the owl was, it would burn 
your eyes,” she said. “I can’t believe 
that poor bird had to sit in there.”
Fox said she knew she had to act, 
but she didn’t know where to start.
She asked friends and relatives 
for advice until her mother recom-mended she get guidance from the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Ani-mals.
Workers at PETA told Fox to 
video record and photograph the 
conditions in the house. Once Fox 
had footage, she said, PETA con-tacted the Fish and Wildlife Conser -
vation Commission.
With the Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission, Holmes said it’s legal to keep animals in boxes, as long as they are clearly marked and babies have an alternate heat source 
such as a heating lamp. He said he 
cited Straub for her unmarked box-es and lack of warmth.
Holmes and the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission also cited Straub for failing to re-lease some animals, something Fox also found questionable.
“She kept fawns until some 
of them had antlers beginning to grow,” Fox said.
While it is legal to keep some 
wild animals for education purpos-es with a captive wildlife license, the animals have to be categorized as nonreleasable. 
After a rehabber or a veterinar -
ian signs off that an animal can’t 
be released due to a condition like 
paraplegia or blindness, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission must approve that sta-tus before someone can keep a wild animal.
Holmes said Straub kept a few 
animals he believed could have survived in the wild. One of those 
creatures was a river otter with psy-
chological issues.
“The idea of a wildlife rehab-
ber is to release animals back to the wild,” Holmes said. “She didn’t do due diligence and went ahead and had (the otter) neutered. Now, it’s almost unreleasable.”
Though Straub faces multiple 
charges from two state agencies, the most severe punishment she will likely face is a three-year suspended wildlife rehabilitation license.

Aspiring doctors’ admis-
sion process to medical school 
may be different from what 
they thought. 
The 2015 MCAT will in-
clude the addition of social and 
behavioral sciences, advanced 
concepts in biochemistry and 
more critical thinking, making it more than an hour longer. 
The changes may affect the 
process of medical schools that 
rely heavily on MCAT results, 
but for UF College of Medi-cine’s admissions, the test will remain only a small portion of 
a student’s evaluation.
Leila Amiri, director of ad-
missions for UF’s College of 
Medicine, said it is not chang-ing its admissions prerequi-
sites, and she does not think 
students should be too con-cerned about the changes or the length of the test.
“A test is one snapshot of 
a person’s performance,” she said.
Owen Farcy, director of pre-
health programs for Kaplan Test Prep, said the changes will take effect in March 2015, making this year’s freshmen 
the first students impacted.
“Medical schools are recog-
nizing the role of the physician 
is changing, and the skills that 
students need to be coming in 
with are changing as well,” he said.
Farcy said the reason the 
MCAT is so important is that it 
has traditionally been seen as a predictor of students’ success in medical school.
He said the AAMC, the 
company that writes and ad-ministers the test, realized its science content was outdated. The last revision of the MCAT was in 1991, and a lot has hap-pened in the past 20 years re-garding changes in medical science.
“Medicine is an extremely 
dynamic field, and there are advances happening every year,” Farcy said. “Many of those advances and changes will hopefully be included in some way, shape or form on the MCAT itself.”
However, Amiri said, UF’s 
College of Medicine will con-
tinue using the exam results the same way.
“We are not expecting this 
test to be a miracle device for us to be able to find the quali-fied versus the less qualified students,” she said.
Amiri said that when 
screening candidates for inter -
views, about 40 percent of their ranking is based on metrics. 
She said UF gets about 3,000 
applications and has about 117 
spots to fill.
“We have such a small 
number of students that we 
can accept anyway,” she said. 
“We could never allow a test to 
identify who we would want to accept as a student.”
Farcy said pre-med students 
will not only have to spend an 
extra hour taking the test, but 
they will also have to dedicate extra hours of preparation for the recently approved chang-
es.
Kaia Bednar, an 18-year-
old health science freshman at UF, said she won’t let the new 
version of the test stand in her way.
“It’s always been my goal 
to be a doctor, so I don’t think the MCAT is going to change my decision,” Bednar said.
Amiri said the changes will 
initially be an adjustment for 
the admissions office. 
She said it will be difficult to 
predict students’ success based 
on their test scores because the 
meaning of the results will be 
unclear at first.
But the office is excited 
about the changes, she said, and the new MCAT will be 
more holistic.
Exploratory freshman Jor -
dan Hayes, 19, said he hopes to attend UF’s College of 
Medicine, and the extra work and effort will be worthwhile if it means he will be more 
prepared once he’s in medical 
school.
“What’s another hour on an 
exam?” he said. “I’ve kind of accepted that it’s going to be a 
long road regardless, so it’s just 
a matter of getting through it.”MCAT adds more

You’re not alone: Lean on the Gator Nation
Thanksgiving passed. 
We prepare to cross from November into Decem-
ber to begin the highlight of the holiday season.  
After returning home from the extended Turkey Day 
break, the majority of us may have ﬁ  nally realized that the 
bonds and relationships we have developed at UF deﬁ  ne us in more ways than we initially comprehended.  
There is no doubt I, along with many other ﬁ  rst-
year students who returned home for the ﬁ  rst time in 
months, enjoyed the long-sought comfort of family, home-cooked meals and showers without sandals. 
We appreciate that being home allows us to recharge 
for the next stressful weeks we have together in what, for most of us, is our second home: Gainesville.
At UF, for better or worse, we have the opportunity 
to build relationships and meet people from different backgrounds, different states and unique religious and 
political views. 
After all, what’s important is not what makes us dif-
ferent; it’s the overwhelming factors, such as our collec-
tive goals and ambitions, that come to unite us not just 
in the Gator Nation, but in the entire nation.
One of the biggest concerns and misconceptions po-
tential students have about UF is that the university is a 
large, impersonal place where you are just a number.
This could not be further from the case.  
That belief, instead, is key to spit ignorance and divi-
sions among a potential new student population. 
We all can agree that a major component of long-
term success is creating a network of like-minded and not-so-like-minded individuals and groups that we can 
foster those impactful relationships with.  
As I conclude my ﬁ  rst semester at the university, 
both personally and academically, I have been sur-rounded by a distinct extended family that consists of 
students and faculty. 
Within the university, and in particular my academic college, it is relatively easy to 
interact with people who sup-port me and help me plan to 
achieve my personal and pro-
fessional goals.
My positive experiences at 
UF clearly demonstrate that 
there is a vastly underutilized 
support network here that we 
can all beneﬁ  t from and should take advantage of.
Throughout the last few months, I’ve come to real-
ize how easy it is to put yourself out there and to take 
risks. 
I have since come to the conclusion that we only fail 
if we are unable to learn from our mistakes.
I am pleasantly surprised by the level of support 
here. The network of support I developed remarkably 
allows me to start making a difference on campus and in the community while thriving academically after a single semester.
I tremendously appreciate this aspect that has been 
made possible by the UF community, and I am excited to see what next semester has in store for me. 
College is, and should be, about experiencing a va-
riety of beliefs and cultures in addition to building an 
extensive network of relationships. I could not be more 
thrilled with my experience, and I could not be more thankful.
It seems that the only group that can top my excite-
ment, in the present and into the future, is Coach Will 
Muschamp and the reloaded football team that appears 
to be headed to New Orleans. 
It looks back to championship form after its demoli-
tion of Florida State University.

Wonderland? 
Mind your Ps and Qs
Have you ever made a joke and someone yelled, “Too 
soon!” at you? That’s probably how the mayor of Sea-side Heights, N.J., felt after he made a few comments 
regarding a local roller coaster.
Remember Hurricane/Superstorm/Frankenstorm Sandy?
Well, it cost New York about $32 billion in repairs and an-
other $9 billion to prepare for the next major storm — whenever 
that may be.
“It’s common sense; it’s intelligent,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo 
said regarding the total cost, according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “Why don’t you spend some money now to save money in the future? And that’s what prevention and mitigation is.”
All right, so the storm is a very big deal, and the damage is 
still very real. 
Mayor Bill Akers recently talked about the iconic roller coast-
er in his town. It was knocked off the boardwalk and is now partially submerged underwater.
Akers said he would see if the Coast Guard would approve 
it to be left in the water, because he believed the coaster would make “a great tourist attraction.”
Would it? Would that make a great tourist attraction? Because 
it seems like a haunting reminder of a somewhat tragic event that ruined a lot of lives. That comment is not a super smart one 
to make when your community is hurting.
“Businessmen like Mike Mergott of Mad Mike’s Amuse-
ments said he is rebuilding because he is ‘one hundred per cent 
sure’ families want to come back,”  according to an NBC afﬁ  liate in New York.
Some people who live in the area were only recently allowed 
to look at their homes and what damage they had endured.
Mayor Akers said it “was not the brightest comment.” There 
are plenty of leaders in the wake of Sandy who are much better 
examples.
“In the city , Bloomberg is asking federal lawmakers to put up 
nearly $10 billion to reimburse government agencies and private 
businesses,” according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “That would be additional funding on an expedited basis over the $5.4 billion in standard disaster aid that the city projects it will receive from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.”
He’s trying to ﬁ  nd ways to not put the cost of the disaster 
entirely on the taxpayers or those in the city.
“While the impact of the storm will be felt for some time and 
the challenges are great, I am conﬁ  dent that the city will rebound and emerge stronger than ever,” Bloomberg wrote to the con-gressional delegation, according to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post.
That sounds like how a mayor should behave in a time of 
crisis. Granted, Bloomberg has had a bit more experience with this kind of thing than Akers has encountered. That doesn’t give Akers carte blanche to be a douchebag.
Now, what Akers said is not groundbreaking or terrible or 
even too mean. But there’s no need for him to forget that the people he is supposed to take care of could still be in pain or hurting.

Ten years ago, no one would have predicted that I 
would someday write for an English newspaper, get along in an English-speaking country or study English 
literature.
As a German grammar school student, I was made to be-
lieve that English just wasn’t my language.
I am now doing all those things I presumed impossible, 
because I found the motivation to learn English, spent long hours working through grammar rules and vocabulary and worked as hard as I could when other people asked for a bit more than what I thought I was capable of.
In America, ﬂ  uency in two or three languages is extraor-
dinary. In Germany, it’s average.
So what is it that American students lack? Do they lack 
motivation? Are they unwilling to do the hard work it takes to become ﬂ  uent in a foreign language? Or is there just no one who pushes them?
Motivation to learn a foreign language is indeed greater 
in Germany — and in all of Europe — because large popula-tions that speak different languages reside so much closer. Within a 12-hour drive from Germany, a person could easily pass through ﬁ  ve or six countries and read road signs in sev-en or eight languages — an experience difﬁ  cult to replicate 
in North America.
But that’s not the only reason Europeans learn more lan-
guages than their American counterparts.
At German universities, unlike at the University of Texas, 
where even majors in popular languages like French start 
with a beginner course, students enter college-level language courses ﬂ  uent, more or less. They acquired their language skills in primary and secondary schools. Studying French at the college level in Germany means studying French linguis-
tics or literature. It means gaining an understanding of the 
language and the culture that goes far beyond a ﬂ  uent coffee shop conversation.
At a university in Germany, the languages that are not 
taught in the earlier grades start with very tough introduc-tory courses. Language courses are two hours a week, which is just enough to cover grammar topics. Learning vocabu-lary, practicing speech and writing are things you either do at home voluntarily or you don’t. Failing to do so, however, 
means that you won’t make it to the second year.
So, the biggest difference between learning a foreign lan-
guage in Germany and in the United States is not the level 
of motivation but the quality and style of teaching at grade schools and universities.
In Austin, I have taught German to middle school pupils, 
and I have received language instruction at the university as a student. Both groups seemed motivated to learn a foreign language.
At the school where I taught, the 9- or 10-year-olds were 
at the perfect age to acquire a language. But the advantages of their age and their motivation were wasted because the teaching 
lasted only a week.
Those students probably won’t 
hear or read German again until col-
lege, if ever. Longer-term attempts 
to teach language in grade schools in the U.S. appear ineffec-tive, too. I’ve met many Americans who studied French or Spanish for years in school but can barely remember how to order coffee. They readily admit that the language programs at their primary and secondary schools were ineffective.
Things seem a bit better at the university level. I’ve met a 
number of people who study a foreign language in college and, within two or three years, gained a decent knowledge of that language.
Unfortunately, I ended up in a less effective department.I wanted to continue to study Portuguese — a language I 
started to study in Germany — and the intermediate Portu-guese class I take now offered promise. It’s a small class with a motivated professor. When the semester began, most stu-
dents were equipped with a sound knowledge of grammar 
and vocabulary, and I was optimistic that the course would help me improve. I was wrong.
Rather than move on, the course repeated introductory 
grammar topics. We’re not improving; we’re just chewing on bits of knowledge that most of us digested last year.
Learning a foreign language is hard work, and there are 
moments when I hated every language I’ve learned because I was afraid that I would never understand it, or because I 
thought my head was too full to learn a single word more.
But in these moments of self-doubt, I had teachers who 
said, “Yes, you’re good, but you can be better.”
The Portuguese class doesn’t challenge students like that.
This is not the teacher’s fault; she just follows the cur-
riculum upon which the department decided. It’s not the students’ fault either. It’s the fault of the department’s cur-riculum, which does not adequately challenge students.
UT’s Department of Spanish and Portuguese has good 
equipment and good teachers, but rather than asking its stu-dents to go the extra mile, which is necessary to make prog-ress, it demands far too little.
Schools and universities that don’t use their students’ mo-
tivation waste their talent, time and so much potential.
They miss out on equipping young people with the tools 
needed to successfully go out into the world, communicate, understand and come back with a broadened horizon.
I entered the world of the English language a long time 
ago, and at some point, I discovered the beauty of it. I am still walking around in it today, and so far, it has never ceased to amaze me.

I am a hypocrite.  That 
may be a particularly frustrating admission if 
you’re the type who enjoys exposing logical inconsis-
tencies or character defects 
on your own, but I’m com-pelled to introduce the ac-cusations myself.  
In fact, I plead guilty.I had a hypocrisy problem long before I was privileged 
to write for the Alligator, and I suppose that will ring true once I’m done.  I espouse one ideal and live another.  I condemn gossip only to do the same thing.  I decry the 
appalling injustice of the sex trade, but I struggle to stay 
away from the porn industry , which fuels it both directly and indirectly .  I’m sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.  I prefer reality to cute niceties.
As a follower of Jesus, I wish that Christians would 
stop pretending we are something we are not.  It usually comes from a genuine place, but we end up making our-selves into a bunch of stained-glass liars.  I’m a cheerlead-er for my team, but I’m not drinking the Kool-Aid.  
Christians can really suck sometimes. Perhaps you’ve 
noticed it, too.  
Churches are often like boxes of holy cereal — ﬁ  lled to 
the brim with all kinds of ﬂ  akes and nuts that leave a bad taste in your mouth.  There are charlatans and cheaters; dummies and deviants; creepers and crooks; and for some reason, they’ve taken themselves to the church and locked themselves in.
The bad news is that will never change.  If you were 
looking for a convenient reason to dodge Jesus, you can ﬁ  nd a few in his ragtag following.  
We have issues.Take heart, though.  There is good news in the consis-
tent inﬂ  ux of hypocrisy in the Christian church.  You’ll ﬁ  t in perfectly there.
Yeah, I said it, and you know it’s true.  We’re all hypocrites to some degree, because hypocrisy 
is a human problem.  
I was a hypocrite way before I came to Jesus, and de-
spite some major remodeling, we’re still dealing with some residue.  It’s more frustrating for me than for you, but my physical reality is playing catch-up with my spiri-tual transformation.  
Expect hypocrisy in the church because you’ll be add-
ing your particular brand to the pot — regardless of the other ﬂ  avors present.  Jesus set up the church to be a spiri-tual hospital.  
It’s inevitable that someone will projectile vomit on 
you as he or she is on the way to the master physician —  sick people do that.
This is not to say that the church should be some fes-
tering cesspool of spiritual sketchitude.  Most people’s issues with the church don’t truly stem from hypocrisy but the lack of repentance.  For the uninitiated, repentance is a scary theological word that simply means changing direction.  
See, this is where stuff gets dicey, because most Ameri-
can Christians haven’t heard the word either.  Christians tend to think saying sorry for their sins is the same thing as repentance, but one can head toward the same con-demned destination while his or her lips recite accurate directions to a far better place.    
I wish followers of Jesus would stop trying to hide their 
coughs and runny noses, though, as if people couldn’t see that they need the doctor still.  
I suppose I’ll just own up to it: I’m guilty .  The good 
news is that someone already paid the penalty for my hy-pocrisy (spoiler alert: It’s Jesus).  
It deﬁ  es our logic, but God is building his church from 
the most unlikely materials — I’m not talking bricks and wood.  He’s an organic builder of a different sort, and he has this funny way to transmute hypocrites into some-thing far more valuable.  
Gold is cheap by comparison.
You may ﬁ  nd that hypocrisy is in you, as well. If so, 
you’re in good company .

After operating in Gainesville for a decade, Mi 
Apá Latin Cafe plans to spice up Alachua.
The business, at 114 SW 34th Ave., will open its 
second location Monday. 
Located at 15634 NW Highway 441, the new res-
taurant will be a near-replica of the Gainesville lo-
cation.
It will have the same colorfully painted walls, 
square orange tables and $5 to $8 price range on its menu, said owner Peter Ynigo.
He said the only feature the Alachua restaurant 
will lack is a drive-thru window. In Gainesville, 
he said, about 25 percent of the cafe’s business is 
passed through the window — business he said the restaurant can probably make up for through the friendly atmosphere and good location.  
Ynigo said he chose the Alachua location be-
cause it’s near Interstate 75 but is close enough to Gainesville to maintain strong brand recognition.
The building Mi Apá will take over what used to 
be a deli, he said, and the city of Alachua has sped 
up the process of switching ownership by expedit-
ing permits.
“They want a place like ours in town,” he said.Aurora Ynigo, an employee and the owner’s 
wife, said Mi Apá will hire some Alachua residents and Santa Fe College students from the Alachua campus, and it will transfer some staff members who are being trained at the Gainesville location.
Roxana Rodriguez, a 22-year-old biology senior 
who works as a waitress at Mi Apá, said the pros-pect of transferring to the new location — about 18 miles from the Gainesville restaurant — wouldn’t be a big deal, because she’s used to commuting in 
her hometown.
“I’m from Miami, and everything is really far,” 
she said.
Sheryll Dean, general manager of the Gainesville 
location, said she expects Mi Apá favorites, espe-cially the roast pork entree and the chicken and rice 
plate, to be big hits in Alachua.Some customers already drive from Alachua to 
eat at Mi Apá, she said, and others return daily to 
enjoy their favorite coffee or dish.
She said she’s excited to expand because custom-
ers have told her they appreciate getting meals that 
taste like Latin home-cooking in a friendly environ-
ment.
“It’s like coming home,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 2012

UF Student Senate President 
Christina Bonarrigo announced 
Tuesday her legislative agenda for the rest of her presidency, which consists of fixing the Student Gov-ernment website and outreaching to students.
Student organization members 
are often confused about where to submit allocation requests on the SG website, Bonarrigo said.
Working with Allocations Com-
mittee Chairman Elliot Grasso, Bonarrigo said she wants to make it easier for groups to request fund-ing. She also plans to add a fre-quently asked questions section and senator profiles to the SG web-site.
“We want to let students know 
what their senator is doing in their area,” she said at the Student Sen-ate meeting.Bonarrigo also said she wants 
to reach out to SG-funded organi-zations. There are about 900 reg-istered student organizations, she said, and SG funds about 200 of them. Her goal for the upcoming semester is to reach out to provide for all student organizations.
Bonarrigo’s agenda also in-
cludes having cultural constituen-cy town halls to better understand how students feel around campus. She said the town hall forums will help senators better serve as repre-sentatives. The town hall forums will continue through the Spring semester.

The 2012 Olympics might be 
finished, but an Olympic torch 
will make an appearance in 
Gainesville.
Sunday , Jillian Roberts, a 
2012 Olympic torchbearer and 
UF student, will bring a torch 
given to her after the Olympics 
to St. Francis Catholic High School, 4100 NW 115th Terrace. 
Roberts will bring the torch 
for the Special Olympics Young 
Athletes Program Culminating 
Event hosted by Balance 180 Gymnastics & Sports Acad-emy.
“I’m real excited to come and 
let them see the torch,” Roberts said. “I hope they like it and they can take back something from seeing the torch.“
Roberts, a 19-year-old psy-
chology sophomore, said she 
hopes the children will see 
the Olym-
pic torch as more than just a big, shiny gold object.
She hopes 
the children will want to 
become torchbearers one day and receive a torch of their own.
“It’s a unifying object that al-
lows people to come together,” Roberts said.
After Roberts saw a presen-
tation by Balance 180, a non-profit program that focuses on getting children with disabili-ties involved in sports, she of-fered to bring the torch for the kids to see.
“I consider it a privilege and 
an honor to have the torch at our event,” said Krista Vanden-borne, a director at Balance 180.
Roberts was one of the 22 
American torchbearers at the Olympics.
Roberts carried the torch in 
a town called Slough. She said there were thousands of people lining the streets and cheering.
“It was completely surreal,” 
she said. “It was incredible holding the Olympic torch and Olympic flame in my hands.”
“At first, I was confused and 
thought I misheard,” Vanden-
borne said. “I couldn’t believe 
that we could be so fortunate, 
and Jillian so generous.”Torchbearer to bring Olympic

According to a survey conducted 
by the Josephson Institute of Ethics 
published early this month, about 50 
percent of the 23,000 students sur -
veyed said they cheated on an exam 
in the past year. That’s down from 59 percent in 2010.
However, cheating incidences 
have not declined for UF students or prospective UF students.  
UF’s Student Honor Code Ad-
ministration reviews potential stu-
dents’ admissions if they have a con-
duct or honor code violation, which includes cheating.
In the last three years, the amount 
of admission reviews has remained consistent, said Assistant Dean of Students Chris Loschiavo.
He said there are about 300 ad-
mission reviews each year, and 
about 75 of those deal with the hon-
or code.
Student Honor Code Adminis-
tration Chancellor Shian Knuth said the administration makes a recom-mendation to the Dean of Students Office whether to accept them. The 21-year-old history senior said that when reviewing a student, the most important thing to consider is if the student’s history shows that he or she may be a danger to UF.
“We take into account everything 
students have said — what hap-pened, what they have learned and what sanctions were given,” Knuth said.
Loschiavo said the purpose of the 
reviews is to talk to the prospective students and turn it into an educa-tion opportunity.
Enrolled students who have vio-
lated the honor code go to the Stu-dent Conduct Committee, which hears mediations between students and teachers regarding incidences.
When Loschiavo started work-
ing at UF five years ago, about 150 cases of cheating were reported. That number has increased steadily, and last year, about 450 cases were reported, Loschiavo said.
However, this number is still be-
low the national average, which is based on students’ self-reports.
“UF students cheat at the same 
rate as other colleges,” Loschiavo said. “Faculty attitudes are what has changed.”
He said faculty often doesn’t 
report cases of cheating, but that’s changing.
In a survey conducted by the 
Academic Integrity Task Force in 
2011, 46 percent of the faculty who 
teach undergraduate courses did not report an incident of cheating to the Dean of Students Office. But 70 percent of the 958 faculty members surveyed said they witnessed aca-demic dishonesty in their classroom in the past three years.
The survey also found that about 
82 percent of faculty said they would be dissuaded to report the incident if they believed it was unintentional.
Loschiavo said that the univer -
sity takes honor code violations as opportunities to educate students. Most cases are because students improperly cite something, which results in plagiarism, or they panic and do something dishonest.
“We understand students are go-
ing to make mistakes, and we want 
them to learn,” Loschiavo said.

Nine UF graduate students received 
Graduate Student Mentoring Awards 
from the Innovation through Institu-tional Integration program, or I-Cubed.
The awards, which were given for 
the first time this year, went to graduate students who mentored other graduate students, undergraduate students or K-12 students or teachers during their UF careers, said I-Cubed Program Coor -
dinator Nargiza Ludgate.
Recipients were recognized during 
Graduate Student Research Day in Oc-tober. They each received a $500 award 
funded by I-Cubed, which operates on 
a five-year grant from the National Sci-ence Foundation, Ludgate said.
The award was developed to spot-
light mentoring as an essential part of learning and to acknowledge that there is a group of graduate students who take the time to mentor, she said.
“It’s a mutualistic relationship where 
the mentee is benefiting from the men-
toring relationship as well as the men-
tor is benefiting from the mentee rela-tionship,” Ludgate said. “They have a positive impact on each other’s personal growth.”
Applicants had to write a personal 
statement including their mentoring philosophies and provide letters of rec-ommendation from a mentee and a fac-ulty adviser, Ludgate said. 
One of the recipients was Victor 
Olivieri, a 33-year-old political science fourth-year Ph.D candidate. Olivieri founded the Junior Fellows Program, which pairs undergraduate students with professors and advanced graduate students working on research in the un-dergraduate student’s field of interest.
“Teaching them the foundation of 
research will outlast that first hurdle — 
that first job,” Olivieri said.
He explained that graduate students 
get experience as teaching assistants, but 
there isn’t as much focus on mentoring students about outside-of-the-classroom issues.
“For the most part, I think it is a rela-
tionship that’s undervalued,” he said. 
This is an idea that award recipient 
Christine Lee, 26, agrees with. 
Lee is a Ph.D. candidate in educa-
tional psychology who graduates in De-cember. She manages a lab that includes four psychology undergraduates.
“I’m glad UF is recognizing the im-
portance of this, and I think it’s impor -
tant,” she said, “and that it’s something that I just hope continues to be support-
ed and promoted.”

Kentucky snags Stoops
Kentucky hired FSU defensive coordinator Mark 
Stoops as its next head football coach. Stoops replaces Joker Phillips, who was ﬁ  red on Nov. 5.Volleyball sweeps Southeastern Conference awards
Junior Chloe Mann was named SEC Player of the Year, Ziva Recek earned the SEC Freshman of the Year and Mary Wise claimed her 13th SEC Coach of the Year Award on Monday.UF guard Chandler Cooper will be out for an extended period due to a left foot injury, leaving UF with nine active players. See story, page 15.    I  was wrong.
  Prior to the start of the 
season, I thought winning 
more than seven games was 
simply unrealistic.
  I broke the season into 
blocks.
 I was only conﬁ  dent the 
Gators could win four games : Jacksonville State, Louisiana, Kentucky and Bowling Green.
  I saw four toss-ups: Van-
derbilt, Tennessee, Texas A&M and Missouri.
  I penciled in four losses: 
LSU, FSU, Georgia and South 
Carolina.
  I said the Gators would 
win three of the four toss-up 
games.I thought I was being gener-
ous. 
Instead, they won all of 
them. 
They also won three of the 
four games I assumed they would lose.
  Florida’s predicted weak-
nesses turned out to be just that. 
But I underestimated Mike 
Gillislee and the defense.
  As I expected, the pass-
ing game barely got off the ground.  
And, as expected, defenses 
loaded the box. But, to my surprise, Gillislee remained a force.  
Before this season, his best perfor-m a n c e s were in 
garbage 
time or a g a i n s t non-BCS 
oppo-
n e n t s . 
So why would anybody think he could shoulder the load as a feature back for a whole sea-
son in the Southeastern Confer-
ence? 
  Instead of cracking under 
the pressure, Gillislee rose to 
the occasion and rushed for 
more than 1,100 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
  He didn’t just pad his statis-tics against the weakest parts of the Gators’ schedule. 
He posted 100-yard, two-
touchdown performances against LSU  and FSU — both top-10 defenses.
  I also didn’t think Florida’s 
defense would compensate for issues on the other side of the ball by improving on its already impressive effort from 2011.
  The unit, which returned 
nine starters, improved from eighth to ﬁ  fth in the country in total defense. 
However, it made other sig-
niﬁ  cant strides that the three-spot improvement in total David Carr / Alligator Staff
Sophomore Loucheiz Purifoy carries the ball down the ﬁ  eld during Florida’s 37-26 
win against Florida State on Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee. Purifoy played offense, defense and special teams in the victory. 
� PURIFOY PLAYING ON OFFENSE, 
DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS. 
JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  As a freshman, Loucheiz Purifoy strug-
gled to get on the ﬁ  eld. One year later, Flor-
ida can’t take him off it. 
Purifoy is the Gators’ most dynamic 
playmaker this season, contributing on of-fense, defense and special teams.   
  Between the end of the regular season 
and last year’s Gator Bowl, a neck injury suffered by Marcus Roberson created an 
opportunity for Purifoy. He took advan-tage.
  “He came in and played real well in the 
Gator Bowl,” coach Will Muschamp said. “It’s huge for a young player to take steps 
forward.”
  In one year, Purifoy progressed from a 
special teams gunner to an all-around con-tributor.
  Even in an increased role, Purifoy con-
tributed most signiﬁ  cantly on special teams, the same area in which he thrived as 
a freshman. Purifoy played cornerback in all 13 games last season but earned most of 
his reps on special teams.
  The Pensacola Pine Forest High product 
showed an immediate strength in kick and punt coverage, leading the Gators with 22 
special teams tackles in 2011.
  But that only set the stage for this sea-
son.
  Purifoy is a force on special teams in 
2012, recording seven tackles and consis-
tently reaching the opposing punt returner 
before any of UF’s other gunners.
  He also blocked a ﬁ  eld goal against  Sophomore emerging as versatile threat

Alligator Staff Writer
  
  Will Muschamp made sure he 
didn’t make the same mistake 
twice. 
  As the defensive coordinator 
at Texas in 2008-09, Muschamp tried to turn linebacker Sergio Kindle into a vocal leader. 
  Kindle, a former All-Ameri-
can and NFL second-round draft pick, wasn’t the outspoken play-er Muschamp envisioned.
  Three years later, Muschamp 
has another defensive playmak-er that lets his actions do the talking — safety Matt Elam.
  “You can’t ask somebody to 
be something they’re not,” Mus-
champ said. “You got to let them be who they 
are.” 
  Elam’s versatility and ability 
to communicate play calls on the 
ﬁ  eld has been enough for Florida 
this season.
  Elam underwent surgery in 
January after a groin injury ham-pered him during the ﬁ  nal ﬁ  ve 
games of 2011. 
  The injury kept Elam from 
practicing on Mondays and Tuesdays last season. Still, Elam 
ranked second on the team in 
interceptions and tackles while leading the Gators in tackles for loss.
  Elam focused on getting 
stronger during the offseason. The chiseled safety has created havoc in the defensive backﬁ  eld and at the line of scrimmage.
  “He is a good blitzer,” defen-
sive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “The closer he gets to the line, the more plays that he makes.”
  The Gators defense is play-
ing as well as any in the country,  Safety 
thriving 
as silent 
leader

twitter: @joshjurnovoy  Defense, run game key to UF’s shocking year
SEE JOSH, PAGE 14SEE NOTES, PAGE 14JURNY DUTYUF Fo otballproduction doesn’t reflect.
In 2011, the defense ranked 
28th in the country with an op-
posing quarterback rating of 
117.81. 
This season, Florida leads  the 
NCAA with a 91.50 pass defense 
rating. 
Interceptions have been the 
biggest difference. 
The Gators picked off only eight passes in 2011, good for 93rd in the nation.  
This year, Florida has picked 
off 14 passes. That’s sixth in the 
country.  
UF’s rush defense also im-
proved. 
The Gators gave up just 96.6 
yards per game on the ground this year, which ranks sixth in the country. 
Florida surrendered 132.7 
rushing yards per game last sea-
son, a figure that ranked 40th in the nation.
Florida was ugly this season, 
but it got the job done. Will Mus-
champ’s unsexy plan of running 
the ball and playing stout defense worked.
I was dead wrong on this team. 
But if being wrong means a trip 
to New Orleans to stroll down 
Bourbon Street and participate in drunk karaoke, this reporter is fine with that.

voy@alligator.org.
Missouri and got his hand on 
a punt that Jelani Jenkins re-
turned for the game-winning 
touchdown in Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana.
“He’s got great ball skills, 
and he just has a knack for blocking kicks and playing 
the ball down the field,” Mus-
champ said following the win against the Ragin’ Cajuns. 
“He just has a knack for those 
things. We always try to put him in a situation where he 
can block the kick.”
Purifoy’s toughness on 
special teams helped him earn a starting spot at cornerback 
this season. While he has been prone to penalties, Purifoy’s 
aggressiveness has served 
him well in the secondary.
His 51 tackles rank fourth 
among Gators. He also has five pass breakups, which ranks third behind Roberson 
and Jaylen Watkins.
Purifoy really shines in 
identifying “violators,” a term the defense applies to oppos-
ing ball carriers who do not protect the football. He leads 
UF with three forced fumbles 
this season.
Perhaps Purifoy’s most 
crucial forced fumble came on the first play from scrimmage in Florida’s 44-11 win against 
South Carolina on Oct. 20.
Purifoy blitzed from Game-
cocks quarterback Connor Shaw’s right and knocked the 
ball out on the first play of the game, setting the tone for the 
Gators’ dominant victory.
Purifoy described his hit 
on Shaw as a “kill shot.”
“I love blitzing,” Purifoy 
said. “I got a mindset of a line-
backer. … I just love hitting 
people.”
Because of Purifoy’s athlet-
icism, Florida’s coaches try to keep him in the game as much 
as possible. In Saturday’s 37-26 win against Florida State, 
Purifoy became the first UF 
player to start on both offense and defense since Keiwan Rat-
liff did it in 2002. Purifoy also 
returned the opening kickoff, contributing in all three facets 
of the game from the get-go.
Muschamp said Purifoy’s 
days of multitasking are far from over. 
“You’ve got to get the ball 
in the hands of guys that can make plays and play hard and 
play fast and play physical, and [Purifoy] does,” Mus-
champ said. “He will have 
a lot of opportunities as we move forward.”

Safety Matt Elam intercepts a pass thrown by EJ Manuel during Florida’s 37-26 win 
against Florida State on Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee.
Junior a national awards finalist
Muschamp said on Monday.
Elam, a semifinalist for the Chuck Bed-
narik and Jim Thorpe awards, has started 
every game this season. 
He has notched five or more tackles in 
eight of them. 
Elam leads the team with four intercep-
tions and ranks second with 65 tackles and 
10 tackles for loss. 
“Matt is a guy that plays the game very 
focused, fast and physical,” Muschamp said. 
“His leadership abilities are based on 
how he plays. He’s not an overly vocal guy, but I’m never going to ask someone 
again to be something they’re not.”
Driskel to start in 2013: Jacoby Brissett ad-
dressed the media before Florida’s season 
opener three months ago about starting at 
quarterback.
The coaching staff picked Jeff Driskel 
instead, and the Gators finished 11-1. 
Driskel started all but one game. The Gators will not hold a quarterback 
competition this offseason, Muschamp said. 
The job is Driskel’s, but that hasn’t 
changed Brissett’s attitude.
“Jacoby has been great,” Muschamp 
said. 
“Jacoby knows that he is one snap away 
and is a guy that we have a lot of confidence in.”  
Gators get ready for NFL Draft: The NFL Draft may be in late April, but Muschamp 
has already tackled the elephant in the room. 
Several Florida juniors figure into the 
draft discussion.
“I’ve had conversations with some guys 
as early as [Sunday] and [Monday],” Mus-champ said. 
“We’ll handle that when the bowl game 
is over.”
Potential selections include juniors 
Elam, defensive tackle Dominique Easley, linebacker Jelani Jenkins, tight end Jordan 
Reed and defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd. 
The deadline for underclassmen to de-
clare is Jan. 15.
“If a guy is going to be a first-round 
draft pick, I’m probably going to tell him to go to the NFL,” Muschamp said. “That’s 
just my policy. If he’s not, (and) he can improve himself, then I suggest he comes back.”

UF coach� YEGUETE AND ROSARIO 
REMAIN IN UF’S LINEUP.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
During Florida’s 79-66 win 
against UCF on Friday, junior Scot-
tie Wilbekin set new career highs 
in four categories. He finished with 
17 points, eight assists and five re-
bounds in 32 minutes. 
Despite his performance, Wil-
bekin isn’t entering the starting line-up, coach Billy Donovan said. 
“This isn’t a punishment to Scot-
tie,” Donovan said. “It’s more of me 
showing appreciation for what Will 
(Yeguete) has done for our team.”
Donovan said prior to the season 
that Wilbekin would start at point guard, but the junior’s Nov. 8 sus-pension derailed that plan. 
Kenny Boynton moved from 
shooting guard to point guard, Mike 
Rosario shifted from small forward 
to shooting guard, and Yeguete en-tered the lineup at small forward. 
Yeguete played mostly power 
forward and center in 2011-12.  
“[He] had to learn an entirely 
different position,” Donovan said. 
“He’s worked hard. He’s been a real 
good team guy. There may be some 
time during this year that the deci-
sion to put Scottie back in the start-ing lineup would be more from a matchup standpoint.”
Donovan said Rosario will also 
remain in the starting lineup. Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee: During a scrimmage against Rollins College on Oct. 27, forward 
Casey Prather suffered a concus-
sion. Nine days later, Prather suf-
fered a second head injury when 
center Patric Young elbowed him during practice. 
Prather made his season debut against UCF, recording eight points on perfect shooting and grabbing four rebounds in 13 minutes. Al-
though Prather is healthy, trainers 
are making the 6-foot-6 junior wear 
a sparring helmet during practice 
for precautionary reasons. 
“It says Everlast across the front 
and it says Muhammad Ali on the back,” Donovan said. “It’s nothing more than precautionary. Obvious-ly with the guy having two concus-
sions as he had so close together, I 
think there’s a period of time that 
our trainers would like to see him 
continue to [wear the helmet].”
Donovan said Prather is frus-
trated about the helmet because it hampers his vision. However, Young said Prather’s limited vision in practice will improve his reaction 
time during games. 
 “We still give him a hard time 
about that because it looks like he’s 
about to go 12 rounds with some-body every time he puts it on,” Young said. “You got to do what 
you got to do to stay on the court. 
Even if he’s looking like a clown out 
there, he’s still going to be playing 
the same basketball.”
UF open to resuming game against 
Georgetown: On Nov. 20, Dono-van said Florida reached out to Georgetown about completing the 
suspended season opener at the 
Veterans Memorial Arena in Jack-
sonville.
The teams were set to play in the 
Navy-Marines Corps Classic aboard 
the USS Bataan on Nov . 9, but the 
game was called at halftime due to 
condensation on the court. 
“I know that there was some talk 
as it relates to our administration at least speaking to [Georgetown] 
and the city of Jacksonville about 
the possibility ,” Donovan said. “But in terms of anything definitely one 
way or another, playing the game or 
not playing the game, I’m not aware of right now.”
The game would resume in the 
second half and would likely hap-
pen in late December or early Janu-

Coach Amanda Butler thinks freshman 
Chandler Cooper can be an effective player, 
but an injured left arch has thrown a wrench into the plan. 
Cooper is on crutches and her left foot is  
in a protective boot after an MRI revealed a hairline fracture of a bone and a partial tear of an arch.
“Frustrating is the best way to describe 
it,” Cooper said. “Especially when every-body is such a big part of the team. One man down changes the whole dynamic of the team.” 
Surgery, although not immediately 
necessary, remains a possibility if the in-jury does not heal properly. Cooper said Florida’s medical staff will re-evalute her in three weeks to create a plan moving for -
ward.  
“If I don’t take care of it, I will have to 
have surgery,” Cooper said. “That’s why [the coaching staff] is being so careful.”
The injury first developed during a prac-
tice before Florida’s game against Florida State on Nov. 15. Cooper played 25 minutes and scored two points in the 98-67 loss to the Seminoles, but she has not played since. 
Butler initially said Cooper would be 
day-to-day and hoped she would return when the Gators traveled to Las Vegas last weekend for the South Point Thanksgiving Shootout. Cooper dressed for the team’s first game — a win against N.C. State on Friday — but she did not play during the trip. “We’ve been just trying to rest her,” But-
ler said. “We’ve just got to get her back to where she is pain-free.”
Cooper hopes to return before Flori-
da begins Southeastern Conference play against Kentucky on Jan. 3. 
Butler said she was unsure of the time-
table for Cooper’s return. 
“When someone goes down, whether it 
is for a semester or a season or a game, then someone else has to fill in,” Butler said. “That’s what we’ve got to do.”
In three games this season, Cooper av-
eraged 4.7 points in 26.7 minutes. Though 
celebrated as an elite shooter prior to the 
season, Cooper’s defense drew the praise of 
Butler and her coaching staff.
Cooper notched nine steals in three 
games and became a critical part of Flori-da’s full-court press, which has helped the Gators force an average of 21.4 turnovers per game this season. 
“Chandler is more than just a great 
shooter,” Butler said. “She is a really smart player.” 
The injury will cut into Florida’s already 
depleted roster. 
Redshirt freshman Viktorija Dimaite is 
out for the year after suffering a torn ACL before the season. With Dimaite and Coo-per out, the Gators are down to nine active players. 
Senior Jennifer George is confident Coo-
per will return this season. 
“Anyone that is missing or out is frus-
trated,“ George said. “But she’s going to do everything she needs to do to get back out here.”WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 28, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

When he arrived at UF, Matt Jones tried 
to bounce runs outside too often. Now, his 
teammates call him “The Bruiser.”
At 6 feet 2 inches and 226 pounds, Jones 
brings a physical running style to comple-
ment 5-foot-11, 209-pound workhorse 
Mike Gillislee. 
When Gillislee suffered a rib injury in 
UF’s 37-26 win against FSU on Saturday, Jones took on a larger role, carrying eight times for 81 yards and a game-sealing 32-yard score. 
“We call him ‘The Bruiser’ because he’s 
our big back, and he did step up,” center 
Jonotthan Harrison said. “He’s got a great 
future here.” 
Jones needed time to find success at 
UF. During Florida’s first 10 games, he averaged 3.4 yards per carry on 33 rushes. Jones split backup reps with sophomore Mack Brown early in the season, but Brown suffered an ankle injury against Missouri on Nov . 3 and has not carried the 
ball since. 
Jones stepped up to fill the void, rush-
ing 16 times for 146 yards and a touch-
down in UF’s past two games. 
“It’s just confidence,” Harrison said. “It 
happens to all young players. You get into your first couple of games, you’re a little nervous. You have the jitters. But as soon as you get used to it, you’re just like, ‘Let’s 
just play football. Let’s just go out there 
and do what I do.’”
Coach Will Muschamp said Jones 
needed to learn UF’s scheme and adjust to the speed of the game. 
While Jones could bounce runs outside 
in high school, he doesn’t have the speed to do so in the Southeastern Conference. 
“You’ve got to learn ... to trust instead 
of trying to bounce it,” Muschamp said. “In high school, he’s probably going to outrun most guys. In this league, you’re not going to outrun everybody . So you’ve got to learn to trust your blocks and have a feel for the run game, and that’s what he’s been able to mature and do.”
Jones ran three times for 59 yards dur -
ing UF’s game-clinching fourth-quarter touchdown drive against the Seminoles. 
On the first of those three carries, Jones 
stutter stepped past a defender along the sideline before cutting back to gain 14 yards. 
The Gators returned to Jones on the 
next play , and the freshman charged up the middle. A defender appeared to drag him down after a 7-yard gain, but Jones stumbled forward for an extra 6 yards. He jumped to his feet after the play and punched the air with his right arm to sig-nal a first down. 
UF went back to him two plays later, 
and Jones sprinted untouched through a hole on the left side for a 32-yard score. 
“Nobody was surprised by his perfor -
mance,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “He ran really hard. No one wanted to really tackle him.”
With Gillislee receiving the bulk of the 
carries, Jones took a peripheral role this season. Still, Muschamp views Gillislee’s 
presence as a positive for Jones, calling Gil-
lislee a good role model. 
Gillislee complimented Jones’ perfor -
mance, and Muschamp wasn’t surprised to see Jones thrive. 
“Matt Jones played fantastic,” Mus-
champ said. “We expected him to play that way . … Given the opportunities he’s had, he’s done an outstanding job.”
