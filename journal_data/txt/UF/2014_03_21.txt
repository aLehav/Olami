With cute dog pictures galore, BuzzFeed’s 
creator Jonah Peretti brought his website’s sig-
nature charm to UF Thursday night.
Peretti spoke at the Curtis M. Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts about the science 
behind going viral and how he rapidly rose 
from a college student to the CEO of one of the Internet’s most popular social media sites. 
“The social web is bigger than Google,” 
Peretti said. “It’s bigger than anything.”
Accent Speaker’s Bureau brought Peretti to 
campus, paying him a $40,000 honorarium for his talk. Accent chairman Daniel Landesberg said about 500 people attended.
He also talked about the blurring line be-
tween entertainment and news as well as long-form journalism’s comeback in the digi-tal world. 
When it comes to ﬁ  nding viral success, he 
said it’s not enough to have a good idea — half the time has to be spent thinking of how to promote it.
Peretti ended his talk with a piece of advice 
for those trying to become content creators.
“People are so complex they actually are 
literally crazy,” he said. “We are all literally crazy. Embrace it.” 
Yarden Cohen, a 20-year-old UF telecom-
munication sophomore, said she enjoyed how 
casual Peretti acted while speaking. 
“He was extremely informative and made 
it really student friendly,” Cohen said.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 120 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 2014

TALLAHASSEE — The Florida 
House passed a bill Thursday night ex-
panding the rights of undocumented students to receive in-state tuition.
The measure allows students who 
have attended four consecutive years of high school in Florida to qualify for in-state tuition if they are accepted to col-lege within 24 months of graduation.
 The bill, passed by a margin of 81-33, 
met no opposition on the ﬂ  oor. 
“In this Sunshine State, opportunity 
should shine brightest,” said Rep. Janet Cruz, D-District 58, who spoke in favor of the bill during the debate.
The next step for this bill is to pass 
through Senate committees, a ﬂ  oor vote and a ﬁ  nal approval by Gov. Rick Scott. The governor has publicly expressed support for the bill, as reported by the Miami Herald. 
For UF students like Mariana Castro, 
a 19-year-old UF interdisciplinary stud-ies neurobiological science freshman, 
this has been a long time coming.
“I never would have thought we 
would have come this far and have 
such an impact,” she said. “It started out House OKs in-state tuition 
for undocumented studentsLOCAL

The Gainesville City Commission voted 
Thursday night to approve a recommendation 
that would prohibit minors in establishments that serve alcohol. It also heard a ﬁ  nal report about changing the city’s bus transportation 
system.  
Commission members voted unanimously 
on the alcohol measure. They set preparations 
for the measure in motion at an October 2013 meeting. 
Christine Lester, mother to a 25-year-old 
daugher and 23-year-old son, said after the vote that she believes it’s a smart idea. The 44-year-old Gainesville resident said allowing minors 
entry only promotes illegal drinking.“As an 18-year old that’s been in a bar, yeah, 
they should put a stop to that,” she said. “It’s 
way too easy.” 
Earlier in the meeting, commissioners voted 
to pass a 6-1 motion to re-evaluate costs for RTS improvements and present a ﬁ  nalized list to the county in June. Commissioner Thomas Hawkins voted in dissent.
The company that oversaw the study, Par-
sons Brinckerhoff, evaluated three possibilities 
for RTS.
The ﬁ  rst option, called a No-Build Alterna-
tive, looks strictly at improving existing RTS 
conditions. A second option, the Transporta-tion Systems Management Alternative (TSM) looked at the possibility of adding some limited stop service busses and more frequent service. Commission votes to bar minors 
from places that serve alcohol

Students didn’t hesitate when 
asked to repair the roof of a strug-
gling Alachua County resident 
early Thursday morning.
For the ﬁ  rst time, Sante Fe Col-
lege students joined the UF Rinker 
School of Building Construction, 
which partnered with Rebuilding 
Together North Central Florida to repair the roof of a low-income Waldo resident.
For the homeowner, 63-year-
old Chanita Ross, this volunteer work allows her to continue liv-ing in her home. She had difﬁ  -culties coming up with money to 
make repairs due to her medical 
expenses and the death of her husband nine years ago.
“There are no words for me 
to even begin to thank them,” 
Ross said.  “I will always remem-
ber this, and I truly appreciate them.”
At 7 a.m., about 30 students 
arrived and began stripping shin-gles from the roof.
Volunteers repaired Ross’ roof 
and plan to caulk around win-dows to prevent air leaks and add 
weather stripping to all doors.
“It’s amazing how much we 
can save on energy,” said Robert 
Costello, interim executive direc-
tor of RTNCF.
Lowe’s and Godwin Green 
Rooﬁ  ng donated or sold materials at reduced costs to the group.  The total cost to replace the roof was 
about $400, a price Costello called “unheard of.”    
This home is the ﬁ  rst of nine to 
be repaired during the next month as part of National Rebuilding Month, which begins April 1.
During the month, nearly 200 
Rebuilding Together afﬁ  liates will repair the homes of low-in-come elderly residents nationally, Costello said.
This year, the organization is 
expecting more than 150 volun-teers. 
Projects include ﬁ  ve roof re-
pairs, six plumbing repairs and ﬁ  ve accessible entryway modiﬁ  -cations, Costello said.
Out of about 80 applicants to 
the program, nine were chosen to have their homes repaired. 
Last year, 25 home repairs 
were completed across Alachua County. 
“If we had the money, we could 
easily do 25 to 30 of those 80,” Costello said, “but we just don’t have the resources to do that.”
This home repair organization 
provides critical and emergency 
home repair for low-income, el-
derly homeowners, he said. It strives to increase safety, security and wellbeing for all residents.
The main beneﬁ  t, Costello 
said, is the repairs allow elderly residents to remain in the same home for a longer period of time, cutting down on stressful moving 
experiences. 
Jeffrey Helitzer, a 23-year-old 
UF construction management se-
nior, is a second-time volunteer. He said the program gives him an 
opportunity to help his commu-
nity in a hands-on way. 
“It really gives you an open 
eye on what goes on in the real 
world,” Helitzer said. FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

University Police recently re-
leased a detailed report of the March 
3 stabbing of UF employee Clifford 
Preston near Leigh Hall.
At about 7 a.m., Michael Cravey, 
a 28-year-old Gainesville resident, approached Preston and asked him if he had a gun. Preston, who was with his wife, UF employee Beckie Preston, said no, according to the 
report. 
Cravey walked away, but then 
he came back and said something 
about a man named Mike Potter. Preston said he didn’t know him. 
That’s when Cravey pulled a long 
folding knife out of his pocket and 
attacked Preston. 
One witness said she thought 
it was a prank, according to the re-
port.The woman saw Cravey chasing 
Preston and told police she didn’t 
expect foul play at first. Cravey was 
laughing. 
Then she saw him stab Preston.
Preston told police Cravey 
stabbed him several times near his neck and back, according to the re-
port.
Preston was bleeding heavily 
from his right collarbone and neck. 
Cravey ran and fled in a black Jeep, sparking a police chase through 
the city. Officers determined the chase was too dangerous to contin-ue after Cravey began running red lights and driving the wrong direc-tion on Newberry Road. 
Cravey eventually crashed near 
Sonny’s Barbecue on Archer Road and ran from the site onto Butler Plaza. 
Police tracked Cravey to the Best 
Buy parking lot. An officer fired multiple shots after Cravey charged at police with a hatchet, according to the report. He was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital and later pronounced dead. 
Police notified the mother, Mau-
reen Cravey, who said her son saw psychological counselors for prob-lems with grief and anxiety. She denied knowledge that he suffered from serious psychological prob-lems. 
The night before the stabbing, 
she told police, her son got up sev-eral times because he couldn’t sleep. He then left the house at about 6:30 a.m., leaving a note that said he was going to drive around Gainesville.

HAPPINESS DAY. MEGAN KELLY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thirteen people meditated 
their way to happiness Thurs-
day in a study room on the sec-ond floor of Library West.  
YES+ Gators, a UF student 
organization that teaches peo-ple how to relax, hosted a cel-ebration of the United Nation’s International Day of Happi-ness. The holiday aims to raise awareness of the importance of happiness, said Tushar Bhat-tacharyya, former president of YES+ Gators and 25-year-old 
UF second-year electrical engi-
neering master’s student. 
The UN General Assembly 
declared the happiness holiday in July 2012, according to the Day of Happiness website. 
Nitin Garg, founder of YES+ 
Gators and a biotech engineer, 
told attendees the key to happi-
ness is based on breathing tech-niques and guided meditation. 
The event, which was open 
to the public, explained a tech-nique involving breathing through one nostril and guided meditation.  
“We have been running 
around a lot looking for hap-piness in all the wrong places,” Bhattacharyya said. “Some-where we have forgotten that happiness lies right within.” 
Sean Irby, a 23-year-old UF 
material science and engineer-ing sophomore, found out about the event through a Col-
lege of Engineering email. 
“I’ve been trying breathing 
techniques and yoga in morn-
ing and already see the impact,” Irby said.UF group celebrates 
happiness, meditates
UF groups helped lobby for the bill
so small, and I’m happy to see it 
grow.”
Castro, born in Peru and brought 
to the U.S. when she was 10 years old, is one of many students affect-
ed by this bill. 
She is a member of the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
program. This does not offer citi-zenship but instead offers security from deportation in the form of work permits, according to the Im-migration Policy Center.
Due to this status, before the bill, 
she could not qualify for in-state tu-
ition and had to defer Spring 2014 
because she could not afford it.
Earlier in the day, Castro and 
other students representing uni-versities including Florida State University, University of Central Florida and UF rallied on the steps of the Florida Historic Capitol Mu-seum. 
Linda Hon, program director for 
public relations and social advoca-cy at UF, said she applauds Gators 
for Tuition Equity, which lobbied 
Thursday.
“When I see young people do-
ing things like this it’s so inspiring,” Hon said. “To me it’s the essence of what it means to be free: To be able to express.” Bill , from page 1
It’s looking at three bus system options
The final option, called the Build Alternative (Bus Rapid 
Transit or BRT), suggested the features of the TSM plus enhanced stations and exclusive bus lanes.
Project manager Alan Danaher said that in 2035, 
ridership would have increased by 11 percent if the No-
Build Alternative was implemented, while the TSM and 
BRT alternatives would increase ridership by 13 percent and 17 percent, respectively.
City Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls noted the 
opportunity for greater ridership numbers was possible, especially if increased RTS access were available to East Gainesville.
“Hopefully the new system can serve everyone who 
needs it,” she said.
Mayor Ed Braddy disagreed. He said the numbers 
seemed realistic, and the No-Build Alternative should be considered.
Danaher noted that if the city chose the No-Build 
Alternative, it would have to fund the alternative based solely off local money and grants. If the other models were chosen, they could possibly be partially funded by the Federal Transit Administration.CoMMiSSion , from page 1SHANNON SAPOURN

Fire trucks, trampolines and 
a bicycle obstacle course will be 
on campus this Saturday for the Bike Rodeo and Summer Safety Fair in Gainesville. 
The fourth annual event, 
held between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m., offers children activities to edu-cate them about bike safety and road rules.
This year, the rodeo is be-
ing held in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center parking lot. 
The event also has its first ma-
jor sponsor: Kohl’s department store.
John Stephen, the clinical 
leader at UF Health Shands Hospital for Children, said be-fore the Kohl’s sponsorship, the event never had substantial ad-vertising.   
“We’ve never had that kind 
of funding or exposure, so I’m hoping there will be a larger turnout,” he said. 
University Police Officer 
Gregory Castronover said he expects at least 400 kids to at-tend the event.
“We’re going to have about 
400 helmets to give away,” he said. 
The helmets were donated 
by the UF Pedestrian and Bicy-cling Safety Resource Center.
Children are asked to bring 
their own bikes, but they will also have the chance to enter into a raffle to win one of two donated bicycles.Bike Rodeo to rally

Three UF students are seeking Red Bull’s assistance while competing in Europe. The Beach Bull 
Blondies will be participating in the Red Bull: Can You Make It? challenge April 4.
� THEY COULD WIN A GIANT 
PARTY.
SONIA PORTALUPPI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Three UF students are depend-
ing on Red Bull to give them wings 
while racing through Europe as part of an international competition.
The Beach Bull Blondies will be 
representing UF on April 4 at the “Red Bull Can You Make It?” com-petition.
The team consists of 21-year-old 
UF telecommunication senior Kate Wenzel, 21-year-old UF microbiol-ogy junior Natalie Palmer and 22-year-old UF environmental engi-neering senior Tessa Syvertsen.
The competition drops students 
at various places in Europe with the goal of finding their way to Berlin in seven days, according to the web-site. The prize is a giant party hosted by Red Bull.
The best 100 college teams from 
around the world will be equipped with a welcome kit: a Moto G mobile phone, a sealed envelope with emer-gency funds and a case of 24 cans of Red Bull.
The teams can check in at 30 loca-
tions throughout Europe using their Moto G phones.  A minimum of six check ins are required before arriv-ing at the finish line. There’s one catch: Contestants can’t use money. Only Red Bull cans can be used as currency to receive food, accommo-dation and transportation.
“Each of us bring something 
different to the table, yet all (of us) being extroverted helps the most,” Wenzel said. “Also, we all are very athletic. In which case, (if) we end up walking to Berlin, we are set.”Natalie Boone, a 21-year-old 
family, youth and community sci-ences junior, helped the team create its submission video.
“The focus of the video was to 
show their adventurous, beachy, free-spirited side so that Red Bull could see how perfect a match these girls are,” said Boone. “These girls 
embody student life at UF.”
With only 24 cans for bartering, 
the team has been working on a 
strategy.
“I can’t reveal the winning strat-
egy,” Wenzel said. “I will tell you: We are firm believers on doing things last minute and going with the flow.”
The team is anticipating its fair 
share of obstacles.
“The most challenging thing will 
be food, I think.” Syvertsen said. “You should see Kate when she’s hungry.”

in preeminence funding, but 
the university is asking for at least $125 million extra.
“The purpose of the 
preeminence funding is to hire faculty,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando wrote in an email. “We still have needs for construction, pay raises and programs, particularly after years of budget cuts.”
Among Machen’s requests 
are $15 million for a new chemistry building, $10 million to turn Newell Hall into a study center and $60 million for deferred maintenance on structures around campus.
However, Machen wrote in 
an email to UF advocacy group Gators for Higher Education, “our highest priority is securing the funds for raises 
for our excellent faculty and 
staff.”
All state employees received 
a 3 percent raise last year, and UF workers got a 5 percent 
raise on top of that, Orlando 
said.
Machen also wants $25 
million to add a 96,000-square foot Engineering Innovation 
Nexus Building and to revamp 
an existing hall, Orlando said. 
The Innovation Nexus building 
could boost the number of engineering graduates UF 
produces as well as support 
research.
Some of the 2014 legislative 
priorities were on last year’s list, as well. In 2013, UF got 
$16.7 million for maintenance 
and $15 million for the 
chemistry building. 
Along with the funding 
proposals is $28.2 million in private donations waiting for a match in state funding. The on-pause Alec Courtelis Facilities Matching Program pledges state money equaling any private contributions to a university for building projects.
Gov. Rick Scott will approve 
or veto Machen’s requests in about a month. 
However, Orlando said, it’ll 
be difficult to get everything UF asked for.Machen requests

A group of UF researchers was recently 
awarded part of a $4.9 million federal research 
grant to develop a program to prevent child-hood obesity.
“Get Fruved” is a social marketing cam-
paign to promote fruit and vegetable in-take, increase physical activity and help stu-dents maintain a healthy weight, said Anne Mathews, an assistant professor in food sci-ence and human nutrition at UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
UF is working with seven other universi-
ties on the campaign. The researchers will receive $557,000 over five years in one-year increments starting Aug. 1, said Mathews, the primary investigator on the study.
UF sophomores or juniors will be allowed 
to enroll in two academic courses where they will learn about health behaviors, chronic dis-ease prevention, social marketing and mentor-
ing. Then about 330 freshman students will be 
recruited as volunteers, Mathews said.Although the team will only look at these 
specific results over the next two years, the campaign aims to adjust the lifestyles of all students on campus.
“We really hope to help students form 
strong, healthy habits now that they’ll carry forward into their adult lives,” Mathews said.
Brandon Robinson, a 21-year-old UF mar-
keting junior and a group fitness instructor with RecSports, said he thinks the campaign will be a beneficial program for students. UF researchers receive money to help prevent childhood obesity

Amazon Prime costs will go up 
for the first time since its introduc-
tion nine years ago. Prime member-ships will jump from $79 to $99 per year, and Student Prime member-ships will go from $39 to $49.
But this came as no surprise to 
UF economics professor Jonathan Hamilton.
“When you offer a product at a 
very low price, you’re not claiming 
that you’re going to offer it forev-
er,” he said.Amazon Prime’s services in-
clude free two-day shipping, video streaming and Kindle book rent-als.
Despite Amazon’s low profit 
margins, the company has grown, and its stock has been healthy, 
Hamilton said.
But competition with compa-
nies like Netflix drives up prices of 
services such as video streaming, which may have forced Amazon to raise its Prime prices, he said.
UF nursing freshman Allison 
Cosgrove, 18, said she uses her mom’s Amazon Prime member-ship for free shipping and stream-ing.
But with the membership cost 
increase, she said her family prob-ably won’t buy Prime again.
Reid Gill, a 19-year-old UF com-
puter science sophomore, said he had Amazon Student Prime until his six-month free trial ran out.
“I used my six free months quite 
a bit,” he said. 
He said Amazon Prime is worth 
the money if users buy a lot online. 
Hamilton said he doesn’t pre-
dict the company suffering any 
major losses. 
“It might slow the growth a 
little,” he said. “But I suspect they 
will continue to sign up custom-ers.”Amazon Prime prices rise, college students collectively groan“We really hope to help students 
form strong, healthy habits now that 
they’ll carry forward into their adult

Darts & Laurels
UF’s law school is in a state of turmoil right now follow-
ing President Bernie Machen’s decision to overrule the sug-gestions that the school’s faculty and a private Los Angeles 
ﬁ  rm — whose consultation cost $90,000 — presented in the 
school’s search for a new dean. 
Students and faculty in the school expressed their anger 
and concern about Machen’s decision both in an interview 
with the Alligator and in an anonymous open letter that ac-
cused Machen of racism and homophobia. Of the three ﬁ  nal candidates for the dean search, one was a black man, and one was a gay man. 
In an institution such as UF with overwhelmingly white, 
straight male leaders, diversity is something that needs to be pushed. Clearly, it won’t happen organically. This week, we’re throwing a DART to Machen for disregarding the 
needs of UF’s law school. 
While certain university presidents aren’t pushing for 
positive change, other areas of the state are. We’re talking to you, Miami Beach Public Works Department. PBS News Hour ran a lengthy report this week detailing the changes in Florida’s sea levels — namely, that sea levels in south Flori-
da are projected to rise between 3 and 7 inches by 2030 and 
between 9 and 24 inches by 2060. 
Miami is working to prepare the city for these rising tides. 
A water management plan adopted in 2012 outlined $200 
million of improvements to implement during the next 20 
years to ensure the safety of Miami’s infrastructure — and its residents. For that, the City of Miami gets a LAUREL for 
adopting progressive policies. Hopefully the rest of south Florida will follow suit. 
If you read Gawker or watch “Chelsea Lately,” you know 
that Gainesville’s notorious — ugh — serial urinator has caught national attention. 
As if the story angle wasn’t bad enough, a laughably bad 
crime sketch was released of the fugitive. Of all the compari-sons, we’re partial to Gawker’s description of the sketch as a “racially fraught Muppet.” Indeed, the illustration is truly the stuff of Jim Henson’s nightmares. The artist of the infa-
mous sketch gets a DART this week. For those who were 
wondering, the criminal himself deserves far worse than a dart. Maybe once he’s imprisoned, all his victims could take turns peeing on him in return? Now that’s a pissing match we’d like to see.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question: Are you betting on 
a March Madness bracket?Today’s question: Do you care about Amazon Prime’s 
higher prices?‘Alice in Arabia’ show could be problematic
It’s pilot season. Networks are scrambling to ﬁ  nd and approve new programming for the coming year, even though the age of network — and even cable TV — 
may be coming to a close. 
ABC Family picked up a few teen dramas: one about 
addiction, one about a sibling tennis team, and one where a sassy teenager gets kidnapped by Saudi Arabians. 
This particular gem is called “Alice in Arabia.” Alice is 
a young, white, presumably American girl whose parents befall a thus-far unnamed tragedy. After that, she gets kidnapped by her royal Saudi relatives. 
Predictably, “Alice in Arabia” is drawing a lot of criti-
cism. The title alone — which compares the Middle East to the illogical, frightening and arbitrary world of “Al-ice in Wonderland” — seems to suggest this show will be riddled with characters and situations that will per-petuate the idea that everyone who lives in this part of the world is an America-hating religious fanatic who op-presses women. 
A large part of the show’s issues is that it was written 
by Brooke Eikmeier. Until September, she was an Army crypto linguist specializing in Arabic. During her career, she worked for National Security Agency operations in the Middle East. It’s an impressive resume, if you agree with everything the government and military have been up to lately. The summary for the pilot contains the line “Life behind the veil.” It’s going to be a rough ride for everyone involved. 
Criticism of the show takes two forms: There are those 
who are skeptical of the show’s intentions and portray-als of Arabs — and by extension, Muslims — because a great deal of Americans don’t know these are two differ-ent groups. And then there is the wing of criticism that ac-knowledges the very real and serious issues in the Middle East, especially misogyny. Critics are upset that “Alice in Arabia” shows viewers these things from the perspective of an American rather than one of thousands of people who have to live in those condi-tions. 
But is it wrong to hope for 
the slim possibility that “Alice in Arabia” may be a positive thing? 
Obviously it would be nice if 
a show about a real Saudi wom-an would get airtime, but “Alice 
in Arabia” is as close as we’re going to get. If anything is clear about our society, it’s that we refuse to care about anything unless it affects us directly. The only way we can be bothered to learn, much less care, about other people’s struggles is if those struggles are happening to someone we can relate to. 
And though the background information suggests it 
has incredible potential to be cheap propaganda from a former NSA specialist, there remains the distinct possibil-ity that this may not be the case. 
The same summary that had the line about life be-
hind the veil also tells us that Alice — and we’re talking about Saudi Arabia here — is “intrigued by its offerings and people, whom she ﬁ  nds surprisingly diverse in their views about the world and her situation.”
If the show happens to be on that side of the “Arabs 
are evil terrorist kidnappers — actually human beings ex-isting in a complex society” duality, what we’ll have is something that will expose people to a view of the Middle East that isn’t overly simpliﬁ  ed and self-serving. 
It can do that as well as bring up the issues of sexism 
and women’s rights problems, not only in Saudi Arabia but our own precious Western civilization. 
In that case, “Alice in Arabia” could be used as a look-
ing glass — pun intended — to reﬂ  ect our own culture’s gender problem in Eikmeier’s ﬁ  ctional Saudi Arabia.

If you’re anything 
like me, a lot goes through your head 
when things start to get serious with the 
person you’re seeing.
“Will so-and-so 
look at me the same 
way upon seeing me right after I’ve chugged ﬁ  ve cups of black coffee?” “How would my mother react to the way we settle even the most serious discussions 
by declaring a thumb war?” But 
most importantly, “When should we be FBO?” — Facebook ofﬁ  cial, that is.
OK, the answer to that last 
question for me is always “never” because I’m a ﬁ  rm believer in sig-niﬁ  cant privacy as a major factor of success when it comes to relation-
ships, but enough about me.
Everyone’s different, and in the 
digital age, the question of whether 
to broadcast your relationship sta-tus to your social media following is a relevant one. Rather than try to convince you of what you should and shouldn’t do, I’m happy to walk you through deciding if de-
claring your commitment to your 
signiﬁ  cant other on the World Wide Web is for you.
First things ﬁ  rst: Have you dis-
cussed your relationship status with your signiﬁ  cant other? And by discuss, I mean have you actu-ally had a talk where both of you agree on what you are? This could 
vary from passing a note that reads, 
“Are you my BF or GF? Circle yes or no.” Or straight up asking, “Are we a couple?” — for those of you who are better than I am at having difﬁ  cult conversations.
If you’re contemplating telling 
the Internet you’re taken, make sure you and your person are on 
the same page about your relation-
ship with each other. 
Reactions to surprises that 
come in the form of Facebook re-lationship requests are best left un-explored.
Now that that’s out of the way, 
think about the people whose opinions you value. Do you care 
if your mom knows you’re seeing 
someone? Would she be hurt if you didn’t tell her ﬁ  rst?
If the answer to either of these 
is yes, make a phone call. Tell your mom how happy you are that John Smith asked you to be his girlfriend — or maybe you asked him, hoo-
ray for the modern 
couple that could not care less about gen-der norms — and go ahead and make that status known. Cue the 
likes.
Now let’s consider a few other 
scenarios.
What if you have a boo thang 
and you both enjoy spending as much time together as you possi-bly can without making each other sick? You guys had the same lock-er combination in the 10th grade when you didn’t even know each other, and Oh. My. God. “Have you seen the desserts in the Grand 
Budapest Hotel?” you once started 
to ask each other at the same time. 
You even agree that relation-
ship titles aren’t important. Well, then you probably haven’t made it this far down the page, and you guessed it, no need to express a relationship status on social me-dia. The people who matter — aka 
you and your boo thang — know 
what’s up, and that’s what’s im-portant.
What do you do if you’re see-
ing someone you’re really into, and things are going well, but one day before you’re ready, someone brings up the conversation about deﬁ  ning your relationship? The 
way to handle this sort of dilem-
ma would be to avoid the person you’re seeing. Avoid eye contact. Avoid conversation. 
OK, that’s probably not the best 
approach. In fact, it’s probably the worst. But hey, there will be times in your life where you’ll want to tell everyone how happy you are 
to be with whomever you’re see-
ing, and there will be other times when it’ll be enough for only you to know you’re happy regardless of whether you’re “in a relationship,” “single” or “it’s complicated.” 
As for me, I maintain that if I 
ever ﬁ  nd the person who convinc-es me “in a relationship” is a status 
I should have on Facebook, then 
I’ll know it’s meant to be.

There is a bill expected to pass in the 
state legislature changing residency requirements for elected ofﬁ  cials and 
candidates for elected ofﬁ  ce. The bill seeks to stop candidates who do not live in the district 
they hope to represent from running. This bill 
will include municipal and county ofﬁ  ces.
Gainesville City Commission candidate, 
Annie Orlando, is a good example of why this change is necessary. Close friends and acquaintances know the home she and her husband have owned and lived in for many years is in Alachua County. They just happen to own property inside Gainesville city limits 
that she is claiming as her residence, but that home is rented to and occupied 
by a nonfamily member. Orlan-do was recently quoted saying she “spends time” at that rental home. This charade is an effort to 
satisfy the residency requirement to run for 
City Commission.
The legal deﬁ  nition of “reside” means 
one’s legal residence or permanent abode, which is in contrast to a temporary or in-termittent residence. Further, you can have only one permanent abode at a time. The bill outlines more than a dozen factors assessing what qualiﬁ  es as a legal residence, including 
where one lives with one’s spouse.Recently, Orlando switched 
her voter registration and the 
homestead exemption address from the house she’s lived in for decades to their rental property. 
Public records from the Supervisor of Elec-tions ofﬁ  ce show she had not voted in any city election prior to 2013.  Public records also show Orlando’s husband is still registered to vote at the county address.
Those who run for ofﬁ  ce claiming residen-
cy in one area while actually living elsewhere have gamed the system for too long. 
By a few sleights of hand — i.e. switch-
ing voter registration address, homestead exemption or renting a house — some can-didates think they have satisﬁ  ed some loose requirement and voters won’t pay any atten-tion. 
In reality, they are perpetrating a lie on 
the electorate.
Orlando has gone to extraordinary lengths 
to cover her tracks in an attempt to make her claim of city residency appear legitimate. 
At a time when honesty, transparency and 
integrity in politics are rare, we must beware of those who are willing to obscure the truth and bend the rules just to get elected.

Legislation could cut out dishonest City Commission tacticsGuest columnRecently, I came across an article 
on something called mountain running. Apparently, it is grow-
ing in popularity as of late.
When I ﬁ  rst came across it, I was 
expecting it to basically be really hilly trail running, you know, running in the moun-
tains. However, there is a lot more to it.
All trail running is not mountain running, and 
all mountain running is not trail running.
For example, according to an article in Run-
ner’s World, “You could run on a sandy beach or a neighborhood gravel path and you’d be trail 
running.”
Those runs are not classiﬁ  ed as mountain runs. 
In order for a run to be considered a mountain 
run, there must be a signiﬁ  cant elevation gain 
along the course of the run. That being said, a run on a paved surface could be considered a moun-tain run if there is a signiﬁ  cant enough elevation gain.
I became particularly interested in this type 
of running after my experience in Utah during Spring Break. I began to realize why Brigham Young University athletes are always doing so well. Running at such high altitudes with such intense hills does wonders for their cardiovascular health. Once 
they get down to sea level, or even 
just a lower altitude, they are able to cream the competition.
I am interested in seeing how to incorporate 
these types of runs into my running routine.
I found a lot of races all around the country 
for mountain running of varying distances. Addi-tionally, going to places like Crowder’s Mountain in North Carolina will give me the altitude and 
gradual elevation needed for a true mountain run. 
And it will mix up my running scenery a little bit, which gets old at times.
Personally, I think incorporating different 
kinds of runs is important for any runner. It keeps you motivated and interested in running. I know that sometimes I get bored running the same old route for the same old distance. Incorporating new places and new types of runs will keep your body 
prepared for any race course you may encounter.

Flavet Field will be engulfed  
by a swell of vibrant colors when the Indian festival Holi makes its 
way to campus for the second an-nual celebration at UF.
The free event, hosted by UF student organizations, is Satur-day from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Holi celebrates the coming of 
spring with colored powder and paint. 
Powder-throwing kicks off at 
12:30 p.m., said Jannet Mathew, Holi director of the UF Indian 
Students Association. Those at-
tending the event are encouraged to wear white
Even though social hierarchy 
still exists in India, people from 
every caste participate in the holi-
day, the 20-year-old psychology sophomore said. It’s meant to cel-ebrate diversity.
“In India, Holi is a day where 
everyone’s position and status within society is equal,” Mathew said. “It’s like starting anew.”
Event organizers handed out 
Holi tattoos on Turlington Plaza this week to promote the event. The first 500 people who come with a tattoo will receive a free T-
shirt, Mathew said.
The Hare Krishnas will cater 
the event with free spaghetti start-
ing at 11 a.m., said Krishna Lunch director Hanan Schwefel.
“We did it last year for them,” 
Schwefel said. “It was a lot of fun.”
The Indian Students Associa-tion has celebrated Holi within the organization for years, but it has only been shared with the university community once be-
fore.
Mathew said association mem-
bers only expected about 300 peo-ple to attend last year. About 1,000 
participants ended up attending, and Mathew said she expects to see double of that this year.
Lauren Munsey, a 20-year-old 
UF public relations junior, said she attended a Holi celebration in Tampa once and plans to go to this event.
“I see pictures of people cel-
ebrating Holi, and underneath all the paint, all you see are smiles,” Munsey said. “It’s really beauti-
ful.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 2014

� IT INDICATES A PERIOD OF 
INFLATION OCCURRED.
ALISSA KOTRANZA
Alligator Contributing Writer 
A new discovery in gravitational 
light waves lends more credence to the 
Big Bang theory, and people at UF in-volved in the field are weighing in on the discovery. 
The BICEP2 telescope was the first to 
produce specific images of gravitational light waves. Scientists said these images further confirm that a period of “infla-tion” — or expansion — happened after the Big Bang, CNN reported Tuesday.  
“The new experiment really helps 
uncover more of the details of the Big Bang,” UF physics professor Clifford 
Will wrote in an email. 
Jamie Bock, physics professor at the 
California Institute of Technology, and 
Chao-Lin Kuo,  a Stanford University as-sistant physics professor, announced the breakthrough Monday.Nathan Caldwell, a 22-year-old UF 
physics, mathematics and software en-gineering senior, said inflation was a pe-riod when the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.  
“One reason why the gravitational-
wave discovery is so important is that we can see physical evidence for an event that happened seconds after the Big Bang,” Caldwell said.
Previous studies on the Big Bang the-
ory have focused on radiation and tem-perature deviations from light that exist-ed about 380,000 years after the bang. 
In contrast, the experiments using BI-
CEP1 and BICEP2 telescopes looked at the variations in direction of this light. 
Will said these “gravitational ripples” 
are different levels of radiation released by atoms during what theoretical physi-cists believe to be the universe’s infla-tionary period.  Circular patterns of light — the gravitational waves or ripples — were what BICEP2 researchers had been 
waiting for.
Will said seven UF physics professors 
research various types of gravity waves. Gators share reactions to   
recent Big Bang discoveryLIFESTYLE

A new iPhone app allows users to harness 
the power of social media to become as anti-
social as possible. 
Cloak lets users view a map with location 
data taken from their friends’ Foursquare and 
Instagram posts in order to avoid contact.
Users can flag specific friends — or all of 
them — and will receive an alert if they’re 
nearby. The warning distance ranges between within one block and 2 miles. 
Cloak joins the ranks of apps like Hell is 
Other People, which uses Foursquare to deter-mine the best places to go to avoid friends. 
Kaitlyne Kramer, a 20-year-old nursing 
sophomore, said she has heard of Cloak but thinks using Instagram data could raise is-sues. 
“I’ve seen people get tagged in the middle 
of the ocean,” she said. “Also, you’re able to put any location you want when you upload.”
Kramer said she thinks people who don’t 
regularly post their location on Instagram could also pose a problem. Cloak would prob-ably assume they’re in the same place for weeks, she said. 
“People could be stuck in Spring Break for-
ever,” she said.UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd said 
because the app doesn’t provide original con-tent, it requires a large influx of user data from sources like Foursquare. 
“If it isn’t provided, the app will die,” he 
said. “They don’t have purpose unless we pro-vide content.”
Steve Johnson, a UF journalism adjunct lec-
turer, said the creation of this app and others like it might reflect a growing movement of people trying to go “off the grid.”
However, Floyd said anti-social apps like 
Cloak don’t indicate a move away from large social media sites because people still have a need for these sites. 
Krystal Dixon, an 18-year-old marketing 
freshman, said she sees how useful the app could be, even though she doesn’t use it now.
“I know some people who could use this 
app,” she said. “It’s funny, and it might come 
in handy sometime.”App uses social media data to 
make avoiding people easier
� IT TURNED DOWN A LABEL DEAL.

Morning Fatty has high hopes for the 
campaign to fund its sophomore album. 
After turning down a record deal by Unit-
ed Artists Alliance Music, the local funk-rock-
reggae band is looking to fans to support  its 
album, “Resistance,” through crowdfunding website Kickstarter. 
Under the proposed contract with the al-
liance, the band — made up of vocalist An-
drew White, guitarist Miller Joyner, bassist John Pop and drummer Jared McEachran — would not have owned its music.
Pop, a 24-year-old UF alumnus, said the 
Kickstarter’s purpose is to create an album 
funded by fans. 
“Our fans are our record company, so 
they kind of feel ownership,” he said. 
The project will only be funded if the band meets its $10,000 goal by 12:16 p.m. today.
As of press time, fans had pledged 
$9,705. 
Scott Sacks, a 31-year-old Gainesville resi-
dent, said he donated because Morning Fatty 
inspires him.  
“They’re such hardworking, young, de-
termined, passionate people,” Sacks said. 
“It’s like, ‘How do you not support someone 
like that?’”
Since releasing its first album, “Out of the 
Hat,” in 2012, Morning Fatty has added a keyboard and a different drum.
The new album includes post-apocalyptic 
themes focusing on subjects such as addic-tion. 
“I think that even if the Kickstarter doesn’t 
work out, they still have the means to make a name for themselves on their own,” said Kel-len Chesnutt, a 26-year-old Santa Fe College 
English junior.
Morning Fatty is performing at 8 p.m. to-
night at The JAM. Tickets are $8 in advance 
and $10 at the door.Local band Morning Fatty looks to roll in Kickstarter funds“In India, Holi is a day

ORLANDO — With the game tied at 39 with just 
more than 14 minutes to play, Florida was faced 
with the daunting possibility of becoming the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in NCAA Tourna-ment history.
But this time, the experienced, mature seniors 
didn’t bail out the Gators. An 18-year-old freshman did.
Kasey Hill led Florida (33-2) to a 67-55 victory 
over Albany (19-15) on Thursday by scoring eight of his 10 points during the game’s final 14 minutes. The Gators finished the contest on a 28-16 run and coach Billy Donovan credits the freshman point guard with giving his team the boost it needed.
“I thought Kasey coming off the bench there in 
the second half gave us really great minutes, played very well (and) was a real good spark for us,” Dono-van said.
Hill, who suffered from turf toe during practice 
this week, was questionable for Florida’s second-round matchup with Albany. But Donovan said Hill looked like he was moving well enough during shootaround, so he kept the point guard available 
on the bench.
However, Hill was kept off the floor for all but six 
minutes in the first half and the Great Danes took ad-
vantage of a struggling Scottie Wilbekin. The Gators limped into the break with just a 34-28 advantage.
In 2007, Florida also took a six-point lead into 
the half against No. 16 seed Jackson State. But the Gators came out of the locker room and exploded offensively to eventually win the game by 43.
When Donovan saw that his squad wasn’t show-
ing that same scoring burst that he witnessed seven years ago, he decided it was time for a change.
Hill came into the game with 16:28 remaining in 
the second half with no points on 0-of-1 shooting, but Donovan needed someone to provide relief for the underperforming Wilbekin and Michael Frazier II.

Following a midweek win against 
Central Connecticut State, No. 1 Flori-
da (29-2, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) 
returns to SEC action when it starts a 
three-game home series against No. 9 Alabama (25-4, 6-0 SEC) tonight at 6 p.m.
The series against the Crimson Tide 
will be the Gators’ first matchup against a top-10 team since defeating then-No. 4 Oregon 2-1 in extra innings on Feb. 28, and the series marks Alabama’s first trip to Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium 
since dropping a three-game series in 
2011.
“When you 
play someone like Alabama, it’s fun 
to watch,” coach 
Tim Walton said. “I don’t need to get 
anyone fired up to play Alabama. I don’t need to get our team fired up. It’s 
a great series, two great teams playing Gators look to leadoff 
hitter to stem the TideBASeBAll

A.J. Puk watched his cousin play against 
his adopted school Thursday afternoon.
Albany senior center John Puk, who 
measures at 6-foot-10, scored 10 points 
and brought down 5 rebounds in the Great Danes’ 67-55 loss to the Florida men’s bas-ketball team in the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament.
A.J. Puk has not had that kind of success. 
In six appearances for the Gators (14-7, 
2-1 Southeastern Conference), the freshman left-hander has a 5.14 ERA. Puk, who started 
in Florida’s series finale against Arkansas on 
Sunday, was not in UF’s announced rotation against Texas A&M (15-7, 1-2 SEC).
“We just need Puk to step up,” reliever 
Aaron Rhodes said. “He’ll eventually get there, I think.”
The 6-foot-7 freshman 
has shown explosive ve-locity when he pitches — he struck out seven UConn batters in only 4.1 innings 
pitched against the Hus-
kies on March 8 — but 
lasted only two innings 
against the Razorbacks last weekend. 
Puk’s 93-94 mph fastball was not enough 
to save him against SEC batters. He surren-dered three earned runs while striking out only two hitters.
Rhodes said while he thinks Puk will suc-
ceed as a starter, he may have success com-
ing out of the bullpen. The freshman has held 
opponents to two runs on five hits out of the pen compared to allowing four runs on 12 UF freshmen struggling early

Almost a week after dropping its ﬁ  rst 
Southeastern Conference contest and third dual match on the road, Florida could use a 
win today when it travels to Auburn.
The No. 5 Gators (12-3, 4-1 SEC) hope to 
end their road struggles when they meet the No. 20 Tigers (14-3, 4-1 SEC) at 5 p.m. Both Florida and Auburn are coming off their ﬁ  rst conference losses of the season, and neither has lost back-to-back matches this year.
After its loss to Georgia on Sunday, 
Florida fell to sixth place in the SEC stand-
ings. But UF has stressed the importance of 
remaining focused on the positives — and there are plenty.
One highlight has been the selﬂ  ess atti-
tude of Florida’s seniors.
As the NCAA Tournament begins for 
men’s basketball, Roland Thornqvist drew comparisons between coach Billy Donovan’s squad of seniors and his own. 
“I told the team this week, kind of like 
on the men’s basketball team, Billy feels like he’s been able to concentrate solely on bas-ketball,” Thornqvist said. “He hasn’t had the other off-court issues … and that’s why they’re good. I feel the same about this team. We have players who don’t care if they play on [courts] three or four, and they’re se-niors.”
The unselﬁ  shness of Florida’s older play-
ers has allowed Thornqvist to construct one of the deepest lineups in the nation. In any given match, Florida’s seniors will play as far down as Court 4.
“Look, you get one point no matter where 
you play,” Thornqvist said.  “I think it’s re-ally dangerous for us to start playing the rankings game. Everybody has a job to do 
and when we put them out we expect them 
all to perform.”That hasn’t been an issue for freshman 
Kourtney Keegan, who has excelled this season playing primarily on the ﬁ  ve and six courts. She is tied for second on the team with 24 wins in singles matches and leads her teammates with 26 wins in doubles 
matches.
First-year player Belinda Woolcock, who 
usually plays on Court 4 or 5, is also thriv-
ing in her singles role. Against Tennessee on March 14, she earned her 24th singles win of the season.
While the freshmen expect to play on 
the lower courts, they are learning valuable lessons from the seniors who don’t always 
compete in the spotlight.
“I think our seniors learned from their 
predecessors to take care of business no 
matter where we put them out,” Thornqvist said. “And they are now in turn teaching our younger ones to do the same. If our se-niors can’t do that, how can you expect your youngsters to?”
Florida split the ﬁ  rst of its back-to-back 
road weekends. The Gators notched a deci-sive win over the Volunteers on March 14 but struggled in a disappointing loss against Georgia two days later. Florida’s doubles play has been the main contributor to each of its losses this season.
As the postseason draws closer, the 
Gators are hoping their depth will help them improve.

Scottie Wilbekin drives down the court during UF’s 67-
55 win against Albany on Thursday in Orlando.
� WILBEKIN AND FRAZIER SCORED 13 POINTS.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
ORLANDO — Sitting at their lockers a foot apart from one an-
other, Scottie Wilbekin and Michael Frazier II had the same look 
of dejection on their face.
Florida had just secured its spot in the Round of 32, but by 
the way the two guards handled the media, it seemed as if their 
season was over.
“We didn’t play to our ability; we didn’t play to our poten-
tial,” Frazier said. “That’s always disappointing.”
Wilbekin, the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year and 
MVP of the league tournament, wasn’t any more upbeat.
“Maybe we took some things for granted,” the senior point 
guard said. “Just didn’t play like we need to in the NCAA Tour-
nament and I think we all know that and realize that and are go-ing to make a better effort next time.”
In a game where the Great Danes used their backcourt speed 
to ﬁ  nd open shots and create havoc on the offensive end, the Gators could have used an effective Wilbekin or Frazier to slow down the attack and possibly even counter it with a strong scor-ing performance.
Coach Billy Donovan didn’t get either Thursday.
Wilbekin and Frazier, two of Florida’s top offensive threats, combined for just 13 points on 5-of-14 shooting. Although both 
guards have become Donovan’s favorite weapons from beyond the three-point arc, they combined to shoot 2 of 8 from three.
“(Albany) had played some box-and-one, they had played 
some triangle-two,” Donovan said. “We had prepared for all that stuff.”
The triangle defense proved efﬁ  cient. Although both Wilbekin 
and Frazier played at least 31 minutes, neither one shot more than four threes or got to the free-throw line more than twice.
Defensively, the duo struggled to contain Albany’s DJ Evans, 
who scored a game-high 21 points on 6-of-12 shooting. If Evans had not gone out with a head injury after the Great Danes tied the game at 39 with 14:32 remaining, he might have done even 
more damage.
“On Saturday if we do that, we could be down by double dig-
its in the ﬁ  rst half,” Wilbekin said.
Pitt, which also beat Albany by 12 points on Dec. 31, played 
some of its best defense of the year in its matchup with Colorado. 
The Panthers allowed just 48 points while limiting the Buffaloes to 35.7 percent shooting.
If Wilbekin and Frazier struggle out of the gates against Pitt 
— especially on defense — Donovan said his team would have a 
hard time moving on.
“Our margin for error as a team is not great,” Donovan said. 
“So when you see what you see today, we were able to overcome 
it and win the game, but we were not the same defensive team I think that we’ve been in the past.”Close game disappoints Florida guardsagainst each other.”
After all of Florida’s starters re-
corded at least one hit against the Blue Devils on Tuesday, Walton 
wants to see that success at the plate 
continue against a conference rival that owns the overall series 30-25 and holds a 12-9 record against the Gators in Gainesville.
“To me, that’s huge when you 
can hit up and down the lineup like that,” he said. “It’s really impor-tant.”Alabama — one of two teams to 
remain undefeated in SEC play — is second in the conference with a .343 clip at the plate. Much of that success is due to the performance of leadoff hitter Haylie McCleney.
The sophomore center fielder 
leads the conference in batting av-erage (.563), slugging percentage (.925) and on base percentage (.667), 
while also placing in the top five 
of the conference for runs scored (third, 42) and hits (second, 45).
But just as Alabama has seen 
its sophomore standout carry the 
team, leadoff hitter Kelsey Stewart 
plans to continue making strides at the plate in her second campaign for Florida.
The sophomore shortstop leads 
Florida in batting average (.430), runs scored (39) and stolen bases (20) while also being second on the team with a .664 slugging percent-
age.
Against CCSU on Tuesday, the 
Wichita, Kan., native recorded her 
team-leading 13th multi-hit game to 
remain the lone player on Florida’s 
roster this season who has made it on base in every game. Stewart also plated her fourth triple of the sea-son — tying LSU’s Allison Falcon for the most in the SEC.
Despite her improvement 
throughout her second year, Stew-
art does not want to focus on the 
past.“It’s really nice because I work 
hard every single day, seven days a week,” Stewart said. “Being able to get hits and do my job is nice, but I’m just focusing on one game at a time.”
Florida will try to rival Ala-
bama’s success at the plate with successful outings from its pitching staff. UF is second in the SEC with a 
1.45 ERA and is holding opponents 
to a .180 batting average.
While senior Hannah Rogers 
and freshman Delanie Gourley have pitched 31.1 of Florida’s 40 
innings in SEC games, Walton em-
phasized the importance of keeping juniors Lauren Haeger and Alyssa Bache sharp for the later games in 
the season. 
“We’re going to need them all,” 
Walton said. “Sometimes you need 
four [pitchers] in a game, sometimes you need two in a weekend; some-
times you need four in a weekend. 
We’ve got to keep everybody ready to go.”FRIDAY, MARCH 21, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida struggled to hit three-point shots against Albany
Not only did the point guard score less 
than a minute after entering the game, but 
he also added a crucial steal three minutes later and then a rare block two minutes af-ter that.
Add another two field goals and a per-
fect 4-of-4 performance from the free-throw line and the Gators suddenly looked like a No. 1 seed.
“I didn’t know what I would get out of him, but I thought we got some very, very good minutes from him,” Donovan said.
Although Florida shot 25 of 49 from the 
floor Thursday, it only sunk 3 of 12 threes — leaving a hole in the squad’s offense. Hill managed to offset the Gators’ poor three-point performance with his ability to get to the basket and draw fouls when he 
drove the lane.
After picking up four fouls and just 
two points in the Southeastern Conference 
Tournament Championship against Ken-tucky on Sunday, Hill was eager to prove his worth in his first NCAA Tournament matchup. 
He said it all began with limiting his 
fouls while maintaining his tenacity.
“I wasn’t in foul trouble like I was last game,” Hill said. “(I was) just playing with confidence, playing aggressive and just try-ing to do whatever I can to help the team.”
Despite the second half surge led by 
Hill, Donovan said his team can’t have a similar performance Saturday when it fac-es Pitt in the Round of 32 or else the Gators will head home early.
“Now, it was good enough to win,” 
Donovan said. 
“But ... is it good enough to play against 
a team like Pittsburgh? Probably not ... so we’ll have to play a lot better.”

Morales struggled in two starts
hits in 9.2 innings as a starter.
Puk has not been the only 
freshman starter who has strug-
gled. Brett Morales has been 
inconsistent in his four appear-ances.
After giving up five runs in 3.1 
innings during his debut against Maryland on Feb. 15, he seemed to improve, surrendering only one earned run in four innings against Miami in his second 
start.
But in his third appearance, 
Morales came out of the bullpen 
and gave up four runs in just one-third of an inning against Illinois 
on Feb. 28. He has only pitched 
once since then — a 4.1-inning start against Illinois State.“Those guys are really good, 
their arms are really good,” catch-er Taylor Gushue said. “They cer-tainly have more than enough tal-ent to be successful at this level. I 
think it’s just the learning curve.”
However, there has been one 
freshman who has picked up the 
slack.
Logan Shore, a Coon Rapids, 
Minn., native, leads the Gators in ERA (0.68) in his 26.1 innings 
pitched. A little more than a 
month into the season, the fresh-man has already emerged as Flor-ida’s Friday-night starter.
“He’s hitting spots, he’s 
throwing everything for strikes,” Gushue said. “He’s been killing it so far.”
Shore will get the first start 
against the Aggies tonight at 7 p.m. in College Station, Tex-as, squaring up against Daniel Mengden, who tossed a complete 
game against the Gators in UF’s 
only game in the SEC Tourna-ment last season.
“He carved us up last year,” 
Gushue said. “We’re going to 
have to have a bunch of good at-
bats against him in order to win … He’s a really good starter.”bASE , from page 13

Ten swimmers and two relays from the 
No. 8 Gators women’s swimming and diving 
team competed in Day 1 of the NCAA Cham-pionships in Minneapolis, Minn., on Thurs-day. Despite setting three school records, the 
only ﬁ  nals appearance Florida made was in 
the 400-yard medley relay. 
The Gators sit in eighth place heading into 
Day 2.
Both of Florida’s relay squads came into the 
national meet with top-10 times. The 200-yard freestyle relay group of sophomores Natalie Hinds, Sinead Russell, Ashlee Linn and senior Ellese Zalewski held up, ﬁ  nishing 10th in pre-
lims with a season-best swim of 1:28.41, but 
they missed on the ﬁ  nals.
However, in the “B” ﬁ  nal they followed up 
with a school-record performance, touching in ﬁ  rst at 1:27.54 — a time that would have been good enough for ﬁ  fth overall.
The Gators had already set a ﬂ  urry of school 
records this season coming into NCAAs, and they didn’t wait for the ﬁ  nals to break another one in the 400-yard medley relay.
Senior Hilda Luthersdottir, Hinds, Zalews-
ki and Russell earned the third seed in the 200-yard free relays with a school-record swim 
that was 0.6 seconds faster than the previous 
time the relay set earlier this season (3:29.67). But the ﬁ  nals saw their time slip to 3:30.27, and the team missed the podium by nearly a whole second, ﬁ  nishing in fourth place.
The 50-yard free was a slip up for Hinds, 
the lone Gator competing in the event, who ﬁ  nished 14th in prelims after recording the nation’s ninth-best time at SECs a month ago. 
She turned it around in the “B” ﬁ  nal when she 
broke the third school record for UF on Thurs-day and won her heat at 21.66 seconds — only 0.07 seconds off the national champion’s time, which would have earned her a silver medal.
Florida was represented well in the 500-
yard free with seven swimmers competing, but the best ﬁ  nish the women could mus-ter was senior Alicia Mathieu in 21st place 
(4:41.78) during prelims. The other six ﬁ  nished 
in 37th, 42nd, 43rd, 46th, 52nd and 56th.
The action resumes today with senior Eliza-
beth Beisel attempting to defend her 400-yard IM NCAA title.

The ﬁ  nal 10 minutes of a game 
can contain more pressure than 
the ﬁ  rst 50 minutes combined for a 
goalkeeper.
Having a solid goalkeeper who 
can make big saves and close the 
game with a win is the biggest key 
in those closing moments.
For No. 5 Florida (9-2, 1-0 Amer-
ican Lacrosse Conference), sopho-
more goalkeeper Mary-Sean Wil-cox often ﬁ  lls that position.
In 2013, Wilcox made 11 appear-
ances in the cage during her fresh-man year and played 176 minutes. 
This season, Wilcox has made 10 
appearances with one start and has recorded 246 minutes. She has one win this season and a .500 save-rate 
for shots on goal.
The Lutherville, Md., native 
may not be starting this season, but 
she has been a big player in making game-saving stops.
In Florida’s matchup against 
Dartmouth on Tuesday, Wilcox made four saves on ﬁ  ve shots in 19:45 of play.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said the 
goalkeeper’s big saves in the last 10 minutes of play was indicative of how Wilcox practices.
“It’s funny because we see her 
do that every day,” O’Leary said. 
“It’s fun to watch her play. She’s very athletic. She sees the ball very well. 
“She’s very composed back 
there; she doesn’t get ﬂ  ustered… 
Just point-blank saves.”
The sophomore relieved redshirt 
senior Cara Canington after she al-lowed three goals in less than two minutes, putting Dartmouth within two points of tying the game.
Wilcox’s solidity in the cage has 
proven to be a conﬁ  dence builder for Florida’s still-growing defense.
“Sometimes, defense, like in all 
teams, you go into a slump and just little change-ups really carry a lot of momentum for our team it seems 
like, and everyone just starts pick-
ing up there game,” Wilcox said.
Against Dartmouth, Wilcox 
notched a career-high save per-
centage of .800. She recorded a .714 
against No. 3 Syracuse on Satur-day.
Going into the game against No. 
20 Ohio State (6-3), Wilcox looks to 
continue to support her team in the 
closing moments of the matchup.
“Since it’s a home game for them, 
they’re going to come out with a 
good ﬁ  ght,” she said. “so we just 
have to be ready to play tough.”Sophomore goalkeeper coming up big in limited playing time
