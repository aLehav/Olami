Protesters of the University
Police Department shooting of a
UF graduate student have been
invited to carry their concerns
from the front doors of Tigert
Hall to the front doors of the
White House.
Kwame Appiah Boateng, a
civil rights activist and Ghana
native who lives in California, is
organizing a march to the White
House this summer to present apetition protesting excessive use
of police force on American col-
lege campuses.
"I wish all students across
America will participate
and student leaders will
come and speak."
Kwame Appiah Boateng
civil rights activist
Boateng said he hopes to pres-
ent the petition to President Ba-
rack Obama or White House staff
on July 4, and he wants millionsof people to join the cause.
"I wish all students across
America will participate and
student leaders will come and
speak," Boateng said.
The peaceful march will focus
around the White House lawn, he
said.
The march was spurred not
only by the March 2 shooting of
Kofi Adu-Brempong but also by
shootings in states, including
New York and California.
Boateng, who heard about the
March 2 shooting of Adu-Brem-
pong through a Ghanaian news
site, said he is encouraging UF

Police took a 21-year-old man to a mental hospital after he
ran up and down West University Avenue totally nude Mon-
day morning.
Brian Parnell was sitting just outside of campus when he
decided to shed his clothes at about 9:46 a.m., according to a
University Police Department report. At one point, Parnell be-
gan jumping up and down on a bench, police said.
UPD responded first and was later joined by the Gainesville
Police Department soon after, according to GPD spokeswoman
Cpl. Tscharna Senn.
Officers on the scene decided not to arrest Parnell after con-
cluding he needed psychiatric evaluation.

The Final Four
0 THE MAYORAL RACE IS
NONPARTISAN.
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
As voters head to the polls to-
day for Gainesville's runoff election,
they'll notice their ballots lack some-
thing that might seem essential to
the election.
According to Alachua County
Supervisor of Elections Pam Car-
penter, Gainesville municipal elec-
tions are nonpartisan, meaning can-
didates appear on the ballot without
a political party designation and
cannot campaign with a party.
"It's just a different way of doing
an election," Carpenter said. "It al-
lows everybody to vote for a candi-
date of their choice without getting
caught up with party labels."
However, political organizations
have readily aligned themselves
with certain candidates.
The Alachua County Democratic
Party, both democratic candidates
for Florida's attorney general, cur-
rent Gainesville mayor Pegeen Han-
rahan and the UF College Democrats
support Craig Lowe.
"We support [Lowe] with enthu-
siasm," said Jon Reiskind, Alachua
County Democratic Party chairman.Although the mayoral election
does not allow for candidates to
campaign with a specific party, Reis-
kind believes the race remains based
on political parties and ideologies.
"There are no nonpartisan elec-
tions," he said. "All elections are, by
their very nature, partisan."
Lowe spoke about the more im-
portant elements of the city's elec-
tion today.
"I believe in a progressive, posi-
tive direction," Lowe said.
Don Marsh declined to comment
on the issue.
Stafford Jones, the Alachua
County Republican Party's chair-
man, said the party has given its
support to Marsh but has done so in
a nonaggressive way.
"We are providing some support
to Don Marsh, but we're trying to be
very mindful and respectful of the
fact that it is a nonpartisan election,"
Jones said.
Jones believes keeping the race
nonpartisan fits current attitudes of
voters."if you look at where the public
has been standing, they're frankly
sick and tired of both political par-
ties making things overly partisan,"
Jones said.
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to
7 p.m. today. See elections.alachua.

she said.

Farmers market helps yield ideas
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new crop of ideals is growing at
UF: buy locally, eat organic and care
about where food comes from.
A farmers market was held at the
Reitz Union North Lawn Monday as
part of the first Florida Food Summit.
The farmers market attracted farm-
ers, organizations, students and profes-
sors.
Farmers were able to sell locally and
sustainably grown foods while explain-
ing why organic farming is important.
"It's great that the farmers here are
actually here to talk to you," said Tif-
fany Wu, a psychology junior. "It made
it more personal. I definitely made it a
point to walk through here today."
Wu said she thinks organic food andeating healthy are important.
The farmers market was part of the
UF Office of Sustainability's Florida
Food Summit, which ends today and
gives students the chance to talk about
the environment and the natural re-
sources that go into the production of
food, said Anna Prizzia, the director of
the Office of Sustainability.
"I want to change the world
one steak at a time."
Mordy Kramer
Florida fresh beef vendor
The office had a booth by the farmers
market explaining how food is trans-
ported across the country. On average,
food is transported 1,500 miles before
people buy it, said Sarah Elbadri, an in-
tern at the office.Mordy Kramer, a vendor from Flor-
ida Fresh Beef, said it's hard for a beef
company to stay organic and sustain-
able.
"It's totally different game because
you're not using growth hormones, so
they're not growing as fast," Kramer
said. "So you have to pretty much
dedicate time and effort to every single
cow. I want to change the world one
steak at a time."
There will be panels held on the sec-
ond floor of the Reitz Union starting at
9:30 a.m. today and continuing until the
keynote address begins at 7:30 p.m.
"The great thing about the program
is that the panels are so different," said
Ashley Pennington, the outreach coor-
dinator for the Office of Sustainability.
She said the panels include topics
related to food's relationship with eth-
ics and religion.
There is also a panel discussing
home gardening, Pennington said.

H IT MEETS TUESDAYS FROM 7 P.M. TO
8:30 P.M. AT THE AMERICAN CANCER
SOCIETY HOPE LODGE.
By MEGAN MERRILL
Alligator Contributing Writer
After the devastating loss of his father and
brother to prostate cancer, Sam Gaddy needed
a way to cope.
He found his answer in the American Can-
cer Society's Man to Man program, which of-
fers community-based education and support
for cancer patients and family members coping
with the disease.
The group will meet today from 7 p.m. to
8:30 p.m. at the American Cancer Society Hope
Lodge, 2119 SW 16th St.
Although he has never been diagnosed with
prostate cancer, Gaddy has been a facilitator
for the program for three years to educate men,
especially blacks like himself, who are at high
risk for prostate cancer.
"One of the most continuous components
of prostate cancer is genetics, then
Pubi race and then age," Gaddy said. "I
Health_ wanted to educate myself because
of genetics and how devastating it
has been for African-American men."
Many of the men who attend the meetings
are survivors, but they encourage anyone deal-
ing with the disease to attend.
"There is no reason for men to be loosing
their lives to prostate cancer with so many ad-
vances in medicine," Gaddy said. "It just needs
to be caught early on."
The American Cancer Society also provides
informational books and pamphlets during the
meetings, but many members have found their
discussions to be the most helpful tool.
Charles Cooper, a prostate cancer advocate
and survivor, has attended the program for
two years.
"There are no limits. We can just sit and talk
about anything," Cooper said. "We can identi-
fy with each other and feel each other's pain."

Students carry water buckets on heads for charity
0 THEY RAISED $300.
By STEFANIA FERRO
Alligator Contributing Writer
About 25 students learned about
the strength of women in developing
countries when they carried buckets
of water across campus Monday.
By carrying the five-gallon buck-
ets on their heads, students empa-
thized with women in developing
nations who do this daily.
The walk was hosted by a non-profit dedicated to ending extreme
poverty. Organizers aimed to inform
people about the importance of clean
water in impoverished countries,
said Lindsay Gehrls, public relations
spokeswoman for the event.
Participants watched a short
film about water sanitation before
carrying the empty yellow five-
gallon buckets from the Plaza of the
Americas, past Turlington Plaza and
across the Reitz Union North Lawn
to Riker Hall.
At Riker Hall, they filled their
buckets with water from a blow-up"I think a lot of people take
for granted the life we have
in America."
Robby Rassell
president of Krave
pool and walked back before pour-
ing the water into a plastic container
on the Plaza of the Americas, Gehrls
said.
The water will be disposed of in
an environmentally friendly way,
Gehrls said.Joyce Liu, who walked in the
event, poured some water out of her
bucket due to the weight of it.
"It was really heavy, and I think
that it gave me only a small insight
on what these women and children
go through," Liu said.
The event was sponsored by
Krave, a student group that talks
about life and faith. It raised $300
from donations online and through
the walk. Money raised from the
event will go toward Nuru Inter-
national's water sanitation initia-
tive. Last year, Krave raised enoughfunds to build four wells in Kenya.
Robby Rassel, president of Krave,
wants people to appreciate how they
get their water.
"I think a lot of people take for
granted the life we have in America,
and [they should] know it's not like
that all over the world," Rassel said.
Screen Gualtieri, a recent UF
graduate, did not expect carrying
the buckets would be difficult.
"When I first signed up for it, I
wasn't expecting it to be bad, but a
lot of sweat and muscle went into
it," Gualtieri said.
Protest organizer hopes UF
representative will participate
PROTEST, from page 1
students to take the lead in organizing
the protest.
"Unfortunately, this is a tragedy, but
the UF students should exploit it for the
public good in the end," Boateng said.
Although the plans for the march are
not finalized, Dave Schneider, one of the
organizers of the UF shooting protest, said
he thinks representatives from UF will go
to Washington, D.C., to speak during the
protest.
Schneider said Adu-Brempong's shoot-ing is a stark example of police brutality
and injustice.
"And I think that by getting UF stu-
dents up there, we're taking a very bold
stance that this doesn't hap-
Special pen again," Schneider said.
Report UF President Bernie Ma-
chen met with the UF pro-
testers last week, and UF
spokesman Steve Orlando said he hopes
negotiations will continue to move for-
ward.
"Anybody who has an opinion to ex-
press should express it," Orlando said.They won a Chevy truck and a boat
BASS, from page 1
and featured the top 25 teams in the
country.
After more than 1,000 casts, the duo
caught a total of 10 bass throughout
the weekend, with a final weight of 29
pounds 10 ounces.
"We work really well together," said
Wercinski, a finance junior. "When he
can't catch big fish, I can, and vice versa.
It just seems to work out."
They beat the second place team, Tex-as State University, by 10 ounces.
"We just felt fortunate to make it to
the finals," Gipson said. "We couldn't
believe we won it."
The pair also got a new Chevy truck
and a boat wrapped in Gator colors.
Both the truck and the boat are theirs
to use until they compete in the FLW
Cup in August, a high-level professional
bass fishing tournament.
"We're really excited," Wercinski
said. "We hope to put the boat some-
where people can see it."

Forgo the Vote
Students shouldn't vote
in today's election
ast month, we wrote an editorial trying to convince
you all to vote in Gainesville's city election for mayor
and District 4 commissioner.
Now we're giving you all the reasons you shouldn't vote in
today's runoff.
For one, not a whole lot of you turned out for the initial elec-
tion, which is awesome because it set the standards really low.
If you vote in the runoff, people might expect students to start
getting involved with local government, and no one likes rais-
ing the bar.
Plus, if you vote for mayor and District 4 commissioner,
you'll actually get to decide who runs your city. The problem
with this is that it takes the mystery out of the whole thing, and
everyone knows how boring it is to actually know what's going
on.
Most importantly, the only way we can make sure we don't
elect Gainesville's first openly gay mayor is if students stay far
away from the polls. It's your fault, students, that Gainesville
has a reputation for being progressive and accepting.
Quite frankly, it's embarrassing, and that reputation will only
strengthen if Craig Lowe is elected. Gainesville will be much
better off with a mayor who is beloved by the Tea Party and
wants to make sure the LGBT community never enjoys equal
rights. And we'll be honest; we at the Alligator all aspire to land
jobs at Fox News or as campaign managers for Sarah Palin's
2012 presidential campaign, and we just don't think electing a
gay Democrat will gel with our aspirations. With his history of
supporting equality and human rights, Lowe stands for every-
thing we oppose. We find all the positive vibes sickening, so we
beg you not to vote for him (or, preferably, at all).
And if these reasons weren't enough, don't forget that "Glee"
starts tomorrow. We know you want to pre-game.
Fame Monster
Some people think we'ddo anything to take
jibe at the Palin family,
but we have to wonder why
they make it so easy.
Bristol Palin recently
came out with a noodle-
scratcher of a public service
announcement for the Can-
die's foundation of which
she became ambassador last
year.
Bristol's PSA focuses on
teen pregnancy, but, sur-
prisingly, not the way you
would think.
"What if I didn't come
from a famous family?" she
muses. "What if I didn't have
all their support?"
As the ad continues, flash-
ing between the young Palin
and her infant son, Tripp,
in a well-furnished living
room and news clips of her
life in the spotlight, she sud-
denly ends up in a bare room
wearing a T-shirt, jeans and
(gasp!) not very much make-up. She looks at the camera
and says, "Believe me. It
wouldn't be pretty. Pause
before you play."
Pushing the ridiculous
catchphrase aside, because
it's just too easy to mock,
Palin's ad is still fairly taste-
less.
E! Online said it "preach-
es double standard in preg-
nancy-prevention."
They chalk it up to, "'I'm
privileged, so it's OK that I
got pregnant, but you're not,
so don't.' (We paraphrase .
but just barely.)" We can't
help but agree.
The choice to use Palin in
a teen pregnancy prevention
ad is going to look ridiculous
no matter what, and the an-
gle they have her facing the
problem on isn't helping.
Palmn seems to be giving
us advice that she doesn't re-
ally need to follow, and hy-
pocrisy doesn't look good on
anyone.

People are connected through empathy
try my best to remember that everybody has a story.
It doesn't always work out. In moments of extreme
frustration or pettiness -or, hell, even when I'm really
tired, or I didn't get a chance to eat lunch -it just becomes
simpler to pretend that I'm the only one who's a real human
being. I'll start defining everybody else through the prism of
me -"girl who is taking too long to order her damn cof-
fee" -and think that their existence, as far as I'm concerned,
begins and ends with me.
It's the easy way out, to be sure. After all, it can be tiring
just trying to stay aware of my own thoughts, feelings and
experiences when trudging through an off day. Processing
the fact that other people also have thoughts, feelings and ex-
periences going on -and the possibility that they, too, could
be having an off day, for reasons that could be more painful
than my own -can be emotionally exhausting.
So I get it when people seem to act somewhat self-cen-
tered, and I'm hoping those around me don't judge me too
harshly when I do the same.
I still try, though. Because all empathy comes from this:
that everybody has a story, that everybody has context. No-
body just pops up out of nowhere; no one's just a character
in your story.
And when it works out correctly, remembering all this is
almost a spiritual experience -the sort that quietly connects
all of us with a deep sense of commonality, even if all we're
doing is being a little patient with each other at Starbucks.
OK, maybe you can't follow me to "spiritual." But if
you're reading this out in public, consider this: Everyone you
see right now has likely fallen in love and had their hearts
broken at least once, and probably several times. Each of
them, if they chose to open up, could tell you about small
moments that, although meaningless to most everybody
else, still resonate in their minds when they think about theJoe Dellosa
letters@alligator orghappiest they've ever felt or the worst
day they've ever had. Each of them is
likely feeling worried, anxious or in-
secure about something in their lives
right now.
And each of them probably has
someone in their life -a parent, a
sibling, a significant other, a friend -
who's really hoping they're having a
good day today.
And although that might not strike you as spiritual per se,
looking at someone and then seeing him in this way is, some
days, the closest we get to feeling something resembling a
connection to the strangers who flit in and out of our lives.
I don't believe we all need to learn each other's stories or
anything, but I do think we have to at least think of them
every once in a while: to take in a moment of perspective; to
breathe in a moment of understanding; to think that maybe
the girl who's taking too long to order her damn coffee just
got a call from her parents that her brother's surgery didn't
go well, and although it seems trivial, the decision between
a Caramel Macchiato and a Cinnamon Dolce Latte could, in
some small way, determine whether or not she's able to stay
composed enough to not burst into tears.
The informal pact we make with each other by virtue of
stepping out into public is that we all promise to do our best
to respect each other's stories. It's something more basic than
selflessness or kindness. It's just the minor dignity of gentle
understanding: that I can't pretend to know how you feel,
but I know how I feel, and that's dose enough for now.
And that maybe you need those two minutes to mull over
your coffee choices more than I do, and that's really OK.

----Letters to the Editor
Tea Party movement is about fis-
cal responsibility, not hate
I am appalled by the ignorant as-
sumption in your April 7 editorial
"Tea-bags" which stated the Tea Par-
ty movement is "a group of angry,
crazy people who will do absolutely
anything to create a scene."
It is an unfortunate fact that radi-
cal-minded individuals tend to leech
onto legitimate causes to promote
their crazy ideas.
But, alas, we tolerate it because
this is America, and it would be rath-
er dull if we all thought alike.
The core values of the Tea Party
movement are fiscal responsibility,
constitutionally limited government
and free markets. The movement is
not affiliated with any political par-
ty or organization, nor is it a hate
group.
It is a grassroots movement of
Americans from all walks of life
called to action because of irrespon-
sible fiscal policies and overbearing,
intrusive governmental actions.The
cause is fueled by anger and frustra-
tion, and rightly so. Americans spent
the first three months of 2010 earning
enough to pay this year's tax obliga-
tions at local, state and federal levels.
The Tax Foundation reports,
"Americans will pay more taxes in
2010 than they will spend on food,
clothing and shelter combined."
While in tough times, Americans
are forced to practice fiscal restraint.
Our elected officials in all levels of
government continue to spend like
drunken sailors on leave.
It's time to put an end to it. No
matter what "they" say, don't believe
the hype -you can fight city hall.
And that, my friends, is what the Tea
Party movement is all about.

Craig Lowe for mayor
Today, a runoff election for may-
or of Gainesville will occur between
Craig Lowe and Don Marsh. For
the uninitiated, Marsh is running as
"The People's Mayor," an appellation
proudly displayed at the top of his
campaign Web site and on many of
his campaign materials.
However, his intentions are in
stark contrast to this tagline; particu-
larly, Marsh has stated that he'd like
to repeal the gay rights ordinance
which provides anti-discrimination
protections to gay and transgender
individuals.
The residents of Gainesville have
already voted on a potential repeal of
this ordinance in Charter Amendment
1, and I'm proud to say that we came
out in resounding support for the or-
dinance. Amendment 1 was defeated
with 61 percent voting "no" and 39
percent voting "yes."
Marsh's argument against this or-
dinance is the same tired "Perverts?
In MY bathrooms?" -argument
heard time and time again. This argu-
ment completely disregards the main
intent of the ordinance, but that's nei-
ther here nor there.
Regardless of his or her person-
al beliefs, a true "People's Mayor"
should at least attempt to be a mouth-
piece for the majority of the public
rather than promoting exactly the op-
posite of what the public desires. If
the "People" he decides to represent
comprise less than 40 percent of the
public, then we're in trouble.
Let's show Marsh that we, the
residents of Gainesville, won't accept
a "People's Mayor" who goes delib-
erately against our wishes. Vote for
Craig Lowe on Tuesday.

Chapman thrives in closer role, especially against left-handed hitters
BASEBALL, from page 15
Now, relievers Nick Maronde and
Jeff Barfield are the main set-up guys for
Chapman, who comes in to close the game
for the Gators.
"It (earning roles during the season)
definitely creates good competition and
guys battle not only against the other team
but with each other for positions, roles and
innings," Chapman said.

Why should basketball players face special re-
strictions?
Sure, most non-sports careers encourage or re-
quire a college degree. But if you want to gradu-
ate high school and become a plumber, no one
forces you to go to college.
Obviously, the NBA has a right to enact what-
ever rule it wants (or can get the players' associa-
tion to agree to, anyway). It is a business, and if it
feels play is diluted by kids jumping from high
school, the NBA has a right to protect its product.
But someone in the NCAA needs to grab the
ear of someone in the NBA and explain that just
because 18-year-olds are allowed to turn pro
doesn't mean the NBA has to draft them.

out of high school accurate projections of where
they would really be drafted. Have the NBA and
NCAA work together on a calendar so kids have
a reasonable deadline to decide on the draft and
go to school if desired.
Listen, nothing would make me happier than
the stars staying in college all four years. College
basketball is my favorite sport, and the level of
play would be 1,000 times better. But I admit a
rule like that would be absurd -Kevin Durant is
fighting for an NBA scoring title in what would've
been his senior season at Texas.
The solution to this issue is on the baseball dia-
mond. High school graduates are eligible for the
MLB Draft, but if you go to college, you're not eli-
gible for the draft until after your junior season.
But that is logical, so I know it won't happen.
Instead I'll get a "fix" for an NCAA Tourna-
ment that isn't broken.said.
JOHNSON AND WASHINGTON OUT INDEFINITE-
LY: After returning home from Knoxville,
Tenn., UF pitcher Brian Johnson and right
fielder Kamm Washington were reevaluated
by head trainer John Barrett on Monday.
According to a team spokesman, Wash-
ington has a hamstring injury and Johnson
was diagnosed with a left shoulder strain.
Both are out indefinitely.
They were injured in Saturday's 12-4
loss to Tennessee.
Goalie moved to net in fifth grade
LACROSSE, from page 15
in the fourth grade, she played
in the field as a defender. But she
couldn't catch or cradle the ball, so
she traded up for a bigger stick, a
helmet and padding like her broth-
er wore for football.
She moved to goalie in the fifth
grade, and her natural instinct to
get in people's faces and stop the
ball allowed her to be successful
at the position, but first she had to
face the hazards of being a target
in goal.
In her first game, Canington
said she was nailed in the head by
a ball, and her father was worried
because he thought she would quitplaying the position after the inci-
dent.
"He got really concerned about
it, but I just turned around and
gave him a big thumbs up," she
said. "That's when he knew that
it was going to work out, that I
A0 wasn't afraid of
the ball and that
everything was go-
ing to be good inLacrosse the goal."
Since then, she
has been hit many times -even on
occasion by her teammates -but
Canington considers it an uninten-
tional part of the game. Besides, a
shot off the facemask is still better
than allowing a goal.

Bullpen gives UF late-game assurance
* FLORIDA PLAYS FSU TONIGHT AT 6 IN TAL-
LAHASSEE.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
The Gators' bullpen has made games shorter for
its opponents this season.
If teams are trailing No. 7 Florida (23-8, 8-4 South-
eastern Conference) late in the game, chances are it
will stay that way. The Gators are 20-0 when leading
after the sixth inning this season thanks in large part
to the success of their relievers.
UF will need its bullpen to continue that streak
if it gets the opportunity tonight against No. 6 FSU
(25-7, 10-5 Atlantic Coast Conference) at 6 in Tal-
lahassee.
"Any time our team gives us a lead, it's our job
to hold off the other team to get the victory," junior
closer Kevin Chapman said. "They work so hard to
get that lead, that we got to produce for them."
Chapman has played an integral role in the bull-
pen's success.
After picking up zero saves in his first two sea-
sons, Chapman already has racked up six this year,
which leads the team, to go along with a stellar 1.21
ERA.
But his role in the pen was not as clearly defined
earlier in the year.
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan did not give any of
the relief pitchers specific roles until the season was
in full swing and he knew what he had in them.
In the season opener sophomore Greg Larson,
who is now a middle reliever, picked up the save,
while Chapman made his first appearance in the
third game of the year during the fifth inning in
middle relief. Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
However, that has changed. UF closer Kevin Chapman leads the Gators with six saves and will be counted on if
SEE BASEBALL, PAGE 14 they have the lead late tonight when they face FSU in Tallahassee.
UF LACROSSE
Goalie leads Gators' defensive turnaround
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida's defense is starting to find its iden-
tity, and a freshman is leading the charge.
In the first six games this season, UF (9-5)
gave up an average of 11.5 goals per contest
and went 3-3 during that stretch. Since then, it
has won six of its last eight games, averaging
7.1 goals against.
A defining moment came in the Gators' 13-
11 win over No. 14 Penn State on April 3. The
teams were tied at six at halftime, but UF's de-
fense contained the Nittany Lions, held them
to zero of four free-position shots in the second
half and kept PSU's offensive leader, MollyFernandez, scoreless.
Goalkeeper Cara Canington has been at the
heart of the defensive turnaround. The fresh-
man said her team is "com-
ing into a nice groove" be-
cause the players are getting
to know each other's tenden-
iNS cies.- She said the squad played
like the group of strangers it
was at the beginning of the
Canington season, but now the players'
off-field, sister-like closeness is beginning to
show in their play.
Canington is one of 24 freshmen on UF's
inaugural team, but she had no difficulty tran-sitioning to Division-I lacrosse and taking on
the pressure that comes with being the last line
of defense for her squad.
"It's kind of nice, because I'm the quarter-
back," Canington said. "I can see everything
unfold. I can see the open player. It's tough for
a lot of defenders, because they have to worry
about their girl but also be aware to slide and
help. So, it's fun to be the communicator."
Canington said because the average player
would not voluntarily want to get in front of
the ball, many goalkeepers were born with the
inclination to fill the position.
She falls into that group.
When the freshman first took up lacrosse

The one-and-done rule has got to
go, and the NBA and NCAA must
work together to fix things.
In 2006, the NBA instituted a rule
that a player has to be 19 and one
year out of high school to be eligible
for the NBA Draft.
The idea was to keep players
from jumping straight out of high
school and force them to get some
sort of college education.
Five years later, it's clear it is a
bad idea. Big-time players make a
drive-thru of college, and many pay
no attention to their spring classes.
I'm also a believer that forcing
someone to
get an educa-
tion accom-
plishes noth-
ing. There are
some people
that are sim-Phil Kegler ply destined
Phil on the Hill to play bas-
pkegler@alligatororg ketball for a
living. That is
their job, and no college classroom
can make them any better at that.
Some people might argue that the
current one-and-done setup helps
players who would've jumped from
high school but don't go pro after
their freshman season because they
realize they need more work.
In fact, current Florida center
Vernon Macklin is a close-to-home
example of this. Some people had
Macklin projected to go pro out of
high school, and he was a McDon-
ald's All-American, after all.
The rule forced him to go to
Georgetown, and he is about to fin-
ish his college eligibility next season.
Maybe Macklin would've succeed-
ed jumping straight to the NBA. I
certainly doubt it, but it's possible.
But America has never been a
place big on rules for making sure
you don't do something stupid. If
you want to act like a moron, you
usually can, but you'll have to deal
with the circumstances.

Editor's Note: This is the first of a
two-part series on beach volley-
ball's quest to become a NCAA-
sanctioned sport.

o years ago, Mary Wise
couldn't believe her eyes.
T he football team's annual
spring game was set for later that
day. Fans poured in for their first
taste of football (and tailgating)
since the previous fall. The bum-
per-to-bumper traffic returned to
Gainesville for a day.
In the southwest corner of cam-
pus, some cars pulled off Hull Road,
and it wasn't just because they want-
ed to get out of the gridlock.
They were curious about what
was going on at the small complex
next to Southwest Recreation Center.
Surrounded by a green chain-link
fence, a sea of sand was occupied.
The makeshift "beach" was di-
vided into six sections, each with a
net down the middle. The players
wore jerseys with familiar colors.
The fanshad stumbled uponsand
volleyball, and they weren't turning
away. Eleven of the 12 teams in the
Southeastern Conference (Vander-
bilt doesn't have a volleyball pro-
gram) were present for the first-ever
beach volleyball tournament held
by a Division-I conference.
"If we were playing an indoor
game and had all the doors open inthe O'Connell Center, I'm still not
sure people would be stopping by,"
said Wise, who has led UF's indoor
volleyball program since 1991.
On Saturday, UF will compete in
the third annual SEC Coaches Beach
Volleyball Championship as part of
the Fiesta on Siesta Key.
In two years, fans in various loca-
tions of various weather (but likely
not Gainesville) will be watching the
same sport at a Division-I level.
The movement for sand volley-
ball began in December 2005 with
the meeting of two men in need.
Billy Stone was preparing to pro-
duce CSTV's made-for-TV event in
April entitled the Collegiate Nation-
als. The event intended to crown
"champions" for several sports that
aren't NCAA-sanctioned, such as
snowboarding and boxing.
He selected five sports, and he'd
soon realize the choice for No. 6.
After wrapping up coverage of
the indoor volleyball season, the
game stuck in Stone's mind. He
placed a call to the Association of
Volleyball Professionals (AVP). He
found an eager ear in Al Lau, the
AVP's vice president of sports de-
velopment and new media. One of
his goals, unbeknownst to Stone,
was to improve the developmental
pipeline and increase exposure of
beach volleyball to younger ages.
Lau had thought about develop-
ing a college beach event but needednu 1 mB.
a media sponsor. Stone needed the
right mix of sports to attract viewers
for the Collegiate Nationals. A part-
nership was hatched, and beach vol-
leyball was added to the Collegiate
Nationals. The sport is still part of
the event (now called the Alt Games
and run by CBS College Sports).
Besides switching names, the
Collegiate Nationals has undergone
another major format change.
In 2006, the inaugural year, the
vent waited players ad in-
Angeles for an AVP combine. Eight
were selected to go to Reno, Nev.',
and play in a tournament as individ-
uals. The olloing year, Stoeand
Volleyball Coaches Association as a
third partner in the project. t
Kathy DeBoer, the executive di-
rector of the AVCA, remembers be-and poslay inturnaet as iondivid-
us the foll oweriear, o e on
mats used in Olympic and pro beach
volleyball otwo-woman teams withtah partnering the projeco.
The event proceeded in this for-
mat since then, inviting eight schoolsto participate.
Former Gators Marcie
Hampton and Angie McGinnis com-
peted in the Collegiate Nationals in
2007, the first year of the new format.
Hampton and McGinnis were seed-
ed sixth among the eight pairs and
won one match while losing two,
failing to advance to the semifinals.
Despite being one of the best play-
ers in UF history and growing up in
Gainesville, Hampton didn't have
any sand volleyball experience.
"That was sort of the way of the
world at that time," Wise said.

Kerri Walsh knows a little some-
thing about that world.
Despite growing up in North-
ern California and having a fierce
passion for volleyball, Walsh never
found her way onto a sand court un-
til she was 22 and out of college.
Then again, beach volleyball only
became an Olympic sport in 1996,
Walsh's first year of college.
She had a decorated career at
Stanford (1996-99), where she be-
came the second four-time first-team
All-American in the sport's history.
She competed on the U.S indoor
team that finished fourth at the 2000
Sydney Olympic Games. She felt
burnt out. Playing professionally in-
doors would've meant a move over-
seas, as the U.S. had no such option.
And Misty May (now Misty May-
Treanor) was looking for a partner.
She and Walsh hit it off well.They are widely considered
to be the best beach volleyball duo
of all time and won gold at the 2004
and 2008 Olympics. They won 89
straight matches in AVP and inter-
national competition during 2003-
04. They have garnered Team of the
Year honors on the AVP the past
five seasons, and Walsh has been a
two-time AVP MVP (2003, 04).
Despite an illustrious career,
Walsh said she would've been an
even better indoor player growing
up had she ventured onto the sand.
She had been afraid. Afraid of the
very sand that drew tourists to Cali-
fornia's beaches.
"I consciously avoided it because
I knew I'd be terrible," Walsh said.
"I let my ego get in the way of me
trying it because the sand really in-
timidated me."
Walsh is excited about the sand
having a place in college. She thinks
she would've tried to play indoor
and sand if it were available during
her collegiate days.
She also sees it being a hit.
"You have the demand for it.
You have the athletes for it," Walsh
said. "The corporate world will take
notice of it."
