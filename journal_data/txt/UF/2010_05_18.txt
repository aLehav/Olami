Daytona man flees from police, strips down to only his underwear while running
DAYTONA BEACH — A 24-year-old 
man who led officers on a high-speed 
chase in Daytona Beach and was arrested wearing only his underwear is being held in jail on several charges.
Dominique Aaron was being held 
Monday at the Volusia County Jail on charges of drug possession, aggravated assault on a law-enforcement officer, ag-gravated fleeing and eluding police, and resisting arrest, among other charges.
Authorities say Aaron sped out of a 
parking space Sunday morning, leading police on a high-speed chase.
He crashed into a light pole and a 
fence, then took off on food. As he fled, he stripped off his shirt, which police said had drugs in the pocket.
Police caught him as he came out from 
a backyard in his boxer shorts.

Four law enforcement agen-
cies participated in the Bike/
Pedestrian Law Enforcement Community Workshop Mon-day afternoon at Gainesville Re-
gional Utilities’ downtown office. 
     The meeting addressed ques-
tions about the enforcement of bicycle and pedestrian laws, said Dekova Batey, the program coor-
dinator for the City of Gainesville’s 
Bicycle/Pedestrian Program. 
     “People come to find out how the different law enforcement agencies work,” Batey said. “We’re letting 
law enforcers inform citizens that 
there are other users of the road.”
The City of Gainesville tries to 
host one such meeting annually, Batey said.
“We have a bike-friendly com-
munity partly because of com-
munication with the law enforce-ment,” Batey said. “2010 has a lot less deaths, and a lot of thanks go to these officers.”
The forum, which featured a 
panel of representatives from local law enforcement agencies including the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-
fice, Gainesville Police Depart-ment, Florida Highway Patrol 
and  Alachua Police Department, discussed Gainesville’s new cross-walk safety grant, bicycle laws and how to improve road safety.

� SCENT REVEALS SEAFOOD 
THAT HAS BEEN CONTAMINATED.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
The stench of a spoiled economy, 
rotten gas prices and oil-contaminat-
ed fish is emanating from the Gulf of Mexico.
But there’s good news.One of those scents will help the 
seafood and fishing industries re-cover, according to UF food science researcher Steve Otwell.
As oil continues to spill after the 
Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion April 20, fishing in the Gulf is mostly halted until proper seafood inspec-tion takes place, Otwell said.
However, Otwell is preparing a 
program that trains government of-ficials to inspect seafood quicker and cheaper by identifying the smell of oil contamination, he said.
“One of the interesting things is 
these scents are very potent, and that’s a good thing,” Otwell said. “That way you can detect contami-
nation with the nose instead of hav-
ing to guess. The sensory can be a very good safety measure, but some people can smell better than others. We’re training experts to screen the 
product. We want the best noses in-
volved.”Nose knows food best ON CAMPUS

In a room filled with budding journal-
ists, best-selling authors, respected facul-
ty and a few Pulitzer Prize winners, Rick 
Bragg distilled the art of good writing down to coloring in a coloring book.
“You don’t want to go outside the lines. 
That’s exaggeration and melodrama.” he 
said in his distinctive Southern drawl.
“Be vivid and colorful as is true—not 
as you can be, but as is true.”
The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist 
shared his wisdom during one of sever-
al speeches given during last weekend’s Storytellers’ Summit, a three-day event held by UF’s College of Journalism and Communications.
More than 200 students, professionals 
and local residents attended the summit, which also featured talks by noted jour-nalists Lane DeGregory, Michael Con-
nelly, David Finkel, Liz Balmaseda and 
Thomas French. 
Each speaker exuded a style as unique 
as his or her writing. Where Bragg and DeGregory would often rouse the audi-ence into laughter, Finkel spoke somberly 
of his time with soldiers in Iraq research-
ing for his book, “The Good Soldiers.”
Most of the writers explained why 
they chose a career in writing and why they kept with it.

In what was one of her last 
public appearances as Gaines-
ville’s mayor, Pegeen Hanrahan celebrated May as Gainesville Bike Month Monday afternoon at city hall. 
During the press conference, 
non-profit organization Bike Florida designated Gainesville as a 2010 bicycle-friendly com-munity.
“I’m not surprised we are 
ranked so high,” said Kelci Dennison, a wildlife ecology se-nior. “Gainesville is pretty con-
ducive to biking with all of the 
bike lanes around and natural 
trails as well.”
Dennison, who has been bik-
ing for a year, said she enjoys 
many of Gainesville’s biking 
trails like those in Paynes Prai-
rie.
Hope Howland-Cook, ex-ecutive director of Bike Florida, presented Gainesville with the award. The recognition comes not long after Bicycling Maga-zine ranked Gainesville the 16th-best bicycle community in the U.S.
Also at the conference, rep-
resentatives 
from the City of Gainesville announced that the city will create several miles of new bik-ing trails and 
paths.
“Our biggest goal is to raise 
awareness and to make it known how easy and safe cycling really is,” Howland-Cook said.
The City of Gainesville Pub-
lic Works Bicycle/Pedestrian Program is working to increase bicycle-transit safety and resi-dents’ desire to use bikes as their main form of transporta-tion. 
The board plans to improve 
bicycling routes between  north-west Gainesville and UF, said William Baruch, the chair of sub-committee for the Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Board.
Heavy rain did not prevent 
Baruch from riding his bike to the event. He simply used a plastic bag to keep his  bike seat dry.
“It’s one thing to get your 
shoulders wet, “ Baruch said. “But not your rear end.”
Gainesville Commissioner-
elect Randy Wells, the previous Bicycle/Pedestrian Advisory Board chairman, said proj-ects like these will help build Gainesville’s identity.
“Making Gainesville bicycle- 
and pedestrian-friendly ties in with the kind of development we want to see in our city,” Wells said.

When two locals got “Team 
#01”-labeled badges Saturday 
morning, they thought it was a 
sign.
“We knew it was meant to be 
and something great would come from it,” Gainesville resident Ly-nette Wiggins said. 
Wiggins and her husband, 
Shawn, won first place by beating about 30 teams at the third annual 
Gainesville’s Amazing Race for 
Tourism at the Westside Park Rec-reation Center, located at 1001 NW 34th St.
The event was coordinated by 
the Alachua County Hospitality Council and was intended to in-form participants about local attrac-tions, such as art galleries, theaters 
and parks, said Erica Chatman, a 
council member.
“It is to help people that have 
lived here for years and don’t know some of the great places Gainesville has to offer,” Chatman said, adding that CBS’ reality show, “The Amaz-ing Race,” inspired the idea for the 
event.
Participants 
had to com-plete various 
tasks in pairs, including driving to Newberry, disc golfing and playing mini-baseball games.
The top three teams won prizes 
such as limousine rides, tickets and trips to nearby attractions. 
“I am happy about the large 
turnout and hope people had a good time,” Chatman said.  Teams race to visit

From left to right, Sgts. George Corwine, Joe Raulerson, Dan Miller and officer Lisa Baldree answered 
questions during an open forum held at the headquarters of Gainesville Regional Utilities on Monday.
$94,000 grant is funding 
crosswalk safety program
ing the crosswalk safety program with a $94,000 grant. 
The program uses undercover 
officers at crosswalks to test if ve-
hicles are yielding to pedestrians, 
GPD Sgt. Joe Raulerson said.
“I thought at first, ‘Why are 
they doing that?’” said Steve 
Schnell, a resident at the forum.  
“Then I heard them explain [that] 
rather than waiting for citizens to 
get hit and write a ticket, they will send the police to check if cars are yielding.”
About 40 percent of vehicles 
yielded to pedestrians at the be-ginning of the crosswalk safety program, but as of last week, about five months after the pro-
gram started, that number has 
increased to 58 percent, Raulerson 
said.At the beginning of the pro-
gram, about two to three pedes-trians were hit by a vehicle every week, Raulerson said.
“Really, I’ve got seven to eight 
more months to keep working on the program,” Raulerson said. 
The grant allows professors at 
Western Michigan University and UF to study how to alter drivers' behavior.PEDESTRIAN , from page 1

sation.
“These are some of the best journalists of the last 20 
years,” said jouralism department chair Wil-
liam McKeen, who was one of the event or-ganizers and lectured during the summit's 
biography session.
McKeen collaborated with Mike Foley, master lecturer 
and assistant dean for Student Services, and Dori Faust, a 
program assistant.
Surveying the Gannett Auditorium at the conclusion 
of the summit Sunday afternoon, Foley said he was very pleased with the turnout and very exhausted. 
“Tomorrow, I write thank-you letters,” he said.5 Pulitzer Prize winners

According to a press release, training will last 
four days.
Screeners stationed along the coast will be the 
first line of defense against contaminated seafood, 
he said. If seafood passes their judgment, then it 
will go on to the state and federal inspection levels.
“I think it’s going to help the industry,” Otwell 
said. “It will eventually get the fisheries open. It will build public confidence that we do have some measures to protect them, and we’ll have people 
right on site doing everything they can.”
The oil spill is scary for local seafood businesses, 
according to Justin Griffin, an operating partner at 
Harry’s Seafood Bar and Grille on Southeast First 
Street.
“Even if we’re not sourcing from the Gulf of 
Mexico on certain items, those who are will re-
source from other areas of the world, and it affects the pricing for everyone,” Griffin said. “It’s a scary 
thing, but we’re going to buy as smartly as possible and get our prices locked in as quickly as we can.”
The restaurant is no longer offering oysters, 
which it gets from the Gulf, because the supplier 
had to suspend operation due to contamination, 
Griffin said.
Fisheries near the Gulf are being shut down, but 
Otwell’s inspection methods should open up sev-
eral fisheries, he said.
Although the spill affects the price of seafood, 
the industry should return to normal after a few months, Griffin said
“If people remain level-headed, treat the event 
as it is and see that people in our industry are wise and taking precautions against serving contaminat-ed seafood, this shouldn’t be too big of an issue,” Griffin said. “There are plenty of other places to go find fish.”Professor invents seafood inspection method

� THE FESTIVAL CELEBRATED 
ITS 65TH ANNIVERSARY.
By HOLLY KANE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Pageant contestants typically re-
frain from spitting in public.
But during the 65th Annual New-
berry Watermelon Festival on Satur-
day afternoon, Florida Watermelon Association Queen Shelley Allen lost a speed-spitting contest to Alabama Wa-termelon Association Queen Kimberly 
McCay and National Watermelon As-
sociation Queen Jessica Southard.
The festival, which started in 1946 
as a way to welcome returning World War II veterans,  remains one of the city’s largest events, said festival com-mittee member and lifelong Newberry resident Kathi Thomas, who estimated about 5,000 people attended the festi-
val throughout the day.
The queens’ impromptu competi-tion followed the seed-spitting, water-
melon-rolling, watermelon-eating and hog-calling competitions held under the Shaw Pavilion at the Canterbury 
Equestrian Showplace in Newberry. A 
rodeo took place later that night.
Southard, an agricultural commu-
nications major at UF, won her title in February and travels the country talk-ing about the watermelon and agricul-tural industries. 
“What I’m doing right now is ex-
actly what I want to do for the rest of my life,” she said. 
Outside the pavilion 
and away from the action, two volun-teers used machetes to slice watermel-ons donated by local growers. The half-
moon-shaped slices lay in a puddle of 
juice and seeds, free to festival-goers. 
“I never turned down watermelon,” 
said Melvin Hennessee, who traveled 65 miles from Summerfield for the free fruit. “When you want to see some-thing, you got to go.”5,000 attend annual

CAPE CANAVERAL — A partial power 
outage at the International Space Station 
briefly interrupted Monday’s spacewalk, knocking out robotic camera views of the two astronauts as they worked to install a 
spare antenna.
The outage happened two hours into the 
7½-hour spacewalk by Atlantis crewmen 
Garrett Reisman and Stephen Bowen. The space station’s main command-and-control computer suddenly crashed. A backup com-puter kicked in, but power temporarily was lost to some equipment, including the video monitors being used by the robot arm opera-
tor, Piers Sellers.
Reisman was perched on the end of the 
space station’s 58-foot robot arm when Sell-
ers lost his camera views. Bowen was work-ing with connectors on the space station’s framework. 
The lead flight director later said that may 
have inadvertently contributed to the com-puter shutdown.
NASA said neither spacewalker was ever in any danger. In 10 to 15 minutes, every-thing was back to normal, although the back-up computer remained in charge.
Shuttle Atlantis and its crew of six deliv-
ered the antenna and other spare parts to the space station Sunday. NASA wants to stock-pile as much equipment at the orbiting com-plex as possible before the shuttle program 
ends.
Only two more shuttle 
missions remain. For At-
lantis, though, this is it.
NASA may add an extra 
chore to the second or third spacewalk coming up this week. 
A cable is snagged at the 
end of the shuttle’s inspec-
tion boom. Mission managers said it should be a quick and easy job to free it. The prob-lem prevented the shuttle crew from prop-erly checking Atlantis over the weekend for 
launch damage.
The crew will take on another major ob-
jective Tuesday, attaching a new Russian-
built compartment to the space station.Blackout stalls spacewalk

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSDrew WilsonOPINIONS EDITORProblems at home should be priority
In recent weeks, we have seen natural disasters and 
incidents that have irreparably stained many parts of our nation.
In the Gulf of Mexico, the oil spill has raised many 
questions that remain unanswered. In spite of efforts to stem the flow of oil and clean up the incredible mess, this ongoing disaster threatens the environment for 
hundreds of miles. Torrential downpours in Nashville 
have caused flooding, killing several people and caus-ing incredible damage.
Beyond these natural disasters, incidents like the 
attempted car bombing in Times Square and the wide 
range of horrific crimes committed on a daily basis are 
reminders that there are still troubles in the world that often manifest on our doorstep. These latest events have dominated the news and the American consciousness 
while making one fact very clear to me: We face dire 
problems here at home. 
Ever since the end of America’s isolationist pol-
icy and the advent of our reign as a global police force, so many of our policies have been focused 
overseas and on conflicts far beyond our borders.  
From the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to the innumera-
ble connections in international trade, the United States has  relished its role as a world superpower and perma-
nently tied itself to the international system. 
However, it is becoming increasingly apparent this 
exterior image of a global superpower is resting on a 
rotten core where problems with the very structure of our nation are leading us toward conflict. Many of 
these troubles stem from government funding and use 
of taxpayers’ money. Specifically, we are spending too much money on space exploration and foreign aid.       Recently it was announced that NASA would receive billions of dollars to continue its missions 
into space and try to get back to 
the moon. While space explora-tion is a laudable pursuit, there are many more places on Earth where 
those funds could be put to better 
use. In terms of NASA’s ambitious 
program, we are attempting to run before we can walk and extending ourselves into space while ignoring is-sues at home.
The U.S. also extends itself terrestrially, providing 
large amounts of aid and assistance to countries around the world. While it is important to provide humanitar-ian assistance to those in need and combat global prob-
lems, much of the national budget is eaten up by com-
mitments to developed nations, lessening the amount available for our own domestic pursuits.
While some of these financial commitments may 
seem necessary, the U.S. is too focused on being a super-
power and policing the world that it ignores domestic 
issues that threaten  stability. There are problems with education and transportation that must be addressed and remedied if we ever hope to attain the goals we 
have set for ourselves.
The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the attempted 
Times Square car bombing serve as reminders of these 
issues. It will take a sustained effort to alter the patterns of government funding and extract ourselves from the 
international system that has us ignoring problems at 
home and living beyond our means.

Florida could feel spill’s 
impact for years 
Super Overdone 
Today’s question: Has the BP oil 
spill ruined your beach plans?
102 TOTAL VOTES44% YES56% NOThursday’s question: Did you drop a class?When fall rolls around, one hit show will be no-
ticeably absent from NBC’s prime-time lineup: “He-roes.”
At one point, the show 
was one of NBC’s biggest 
ratings-getter, but viewers 
have been flocking away since the first season’s fi-nale. 
We wanted this to be 
a sign that the superhero phenomenon is coming to an end, but the network is planning to launch a simi-
lar show, “The Cape,” in its 
place.
In the last 10 years we 
have been inundated with 
movies about every B-list 
superhero that comic-book companies could spit out, and most of us can prob-ably tell you more about Peter Parker’s childhood than our own. It was fun at first, but this fad’s grip on 
American culture has be-
come unbearable.
We are looking forward 
to a time when people are 
no longer telling us the lat-
est Batman movie is high art, how they were reading Frank Miller before he was cool or pointing out why 
the latest X-Men movie was 
unfaithful to the source ma-terial.
A few years back we 
scoffed at stories about 1960s parents who said comic books would rot your brain, but we are starting to come around. 
Comics are childish and 
simplistic, and it is about time the entertainment in-dustry found a new foun-
dation.If you have ever had a desire to see the Florida Keys the 
way Ernest Hemingway did, you might want to take that trip before they become little more than polluted islands 
in the oil stream that’s pouring out of the Gulf of Mexico.
BP said on Monday its plan to siphon oil through a mile-
long pipe in the Gulf of Mexico is working, pumping more than 1,000 barrels–42,000 gallons–of crude oil a day into a tanker ship. But it may be too little, too late; one edge of the oil slick is inching closer to a powerful ocean current that could paint our coastline black.
While we are happy to hear one of BP’s plans is not fail-
ing miserably, we are more interested in the company’s plan for cleaning the Florida coastlines on its dime, or if BP even has a plan. BP is only responsible for the first $75 million in 
indirect damages, with the rest coming out of a $1.6 billion 
trust fund that oil companies pay into through a small per-barrel tax.
Florida has one of the strongest tourist economies in the 
world, with millions of visitors bringing the state more than $60 billion in revenue a year. If our beaches get covered in oil, it could mean billions in damages and thousands of layoffs among the nearly one million people who work in Florida’s tourism industry. That trust fund is simply not enough.
The spill would also devalue expensive coastline prop-
erty, leaving the state with less property tax revenue dur-ing already tough times. We could end up losing even more programs than we have in the past few years if Florida has another budget shortfall.
If it were up to us, BP would take the $6 billion in profits 
it has already made in 2010 and save our coasts.

letters@alligator.orgTUESDAY, MAY 18, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Sens. Andy Gardiner and Mike Haridopo-
los introduced two amendments to a bill in the Florida House of Representatives 
that would restrict women’s access to abortion. The bill and the two amendments passed in the House and Senate last week. Florida now waits for Gov. Charlie Crist to either sign or veto the 
bill, which has not yet come to his desk. Once 
it does, he has 15 days to decide.
The first amendment would require women 
seeking an abortion in the first trimester to view an ultrasound and hear a description of 
the embryo. Victims of rape or incest, if they 
can provide proof, are excused from the ex-planation but still must have the ultrasound. The second amendment would not allow state 
or local government funds to cover abortions, 
which would include any insurance plans bought with tax credits. The amendments added to the bill, House Bill 1143, never went through a committee or heard public comment. 
Crist is certainly hearing public comment now; 
more than 21,000 calls have been reported.
We need to demand that Crist veto this bill 
because it interferes with a woman’s right to 
an abortion. Women have had to fight to de-
fend this right since before Roe v. Wade, and since that decision at-tempts have been made at both the state and fed-
eral level to chip away at 
abortion rights until it becomes inaccessible to 
most women. These amendments are just the most recent attempt.
Abortion is already extremely restricted in 
Florida. Seventy percent of counties in Florida don’t have an abortion provider. Proponents of the amendments say using public funds to pay for abortions is wrong. 
However, the state of Florida uses public 
funding to subsidize “crisis pregnancy cen-ters” that encourage women not to have abor-tions through guilt, judgment and often times 
false information.
Without the ability to control our bodies, 
women can never have the same control over 
the direction of our lives as men. 
We are the experts of our lives, and the 
choice of when and if we have children be-longs to us. 
Join us in calling Gov. Crist at 850-488-4441 
and demand that he veto House Bill 1143.

A traditional military fight song called 
“Oh, I Gotta Go” has become the Gators track 
and field teams’ unofficial anthem. This past weekend, the men’s team decided to write a new verse.
“Oh, I Gotta Go Finish the Mission.”For the first time since 1987, the No. 3 
men’s track and field team won the 2010 SEC Outdoor Championship. The men’s team came to Knoxville, Tenn., on a mission to fin-
ish what it couldn’t last year, and it didn’t 
disappoint. Sitting in fourth place on Sun-day, ten points off the lead, the Gators were propelled to victory behind magnificent per-
formances from sprinter Jeff Demps, jumper 
Christian Taylor and the men’s 4x400-meter relay team.
“I’m very, very proud of our men’s team 
for winning its first conference outdoor title in 23 years,” UF coach Mike Holloway 
said. “It’s been a long journey and I’m really proud of the team for its determination and fight. The meet didn’t necessarily go as ex-
pected, but you have to be able to deal with adversity. Great teams are able to respond to adversity and we did that this weekend.”
Florida cruised to victory with 124 points, 
24 points ahead of second place LSU. The men’s team could not have won the meet without stellar performances earlier in the 
weekend from thrower Ke-
mal Mesic and decathlete 
Gray Horn. 
In all, the men’s team 
collected four individ-
ual titles –Demps in the 
100-meter dash, Taylor in the triple jump, Horn in the decathlon and the quartet 
of sprinters in the 4x400-meter relay.
Taylor led the Gators with a huge week-
end, placing second Saturday in the long jump and having a monster Sunday. He  be-came the first Gator to win the triple jump

UF pitcher Stephanie Brombacher allowed four runs in 2.1 innings against LSU Friday in the SEC Tourna -
ment. Brombacher had surrendered just one earned run in her previous 36.1 innings before the loss.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
The Florida softball team came 
into the Southeastern Conference 
tournament on a roll, but Friday it ran into a buzz saw. 
Although the No. 5 Gators (43-
8, 21-5 Southeastern Conference) started the day on an eight-game win streak in which they outscored opponents by an average of 11 runs per game, they got a taste of their own medicine in Friday’s 9-1 SEC Tournament semifinal loss to No. 11 LSU (44-13, 22-8 SEC). UF can only look to Gainesville’s NCAA 
tournament regional for a chance 
to rebound. 
The eight-run margin of defeat 
was Florida’s largest since June 1 of last year, when it fell 8-0 to Wash-ington in Game 1 of the Women’s College World Series final. 
“Overall just really not a very 
good performance,” coach Tim 
Walton said of Friday’s loss. “All 
the way around I didn’t think we played our best. We didn’t pitch as well as we’re capable of and I don’t think we played as well on defense as we needed to.”
The LSU offense struck early 
and often, scoring twice in the top of the first on a bases loaded walk 
and an illegal pitch by junior ace Stephanie Brombacher. 
The Tigers tallied runs in each 
of the first four innings, adding to 
their lead with a solo home run from sophomore Morgan Russell to start the second before batting around in a third inning that saw LSU bring three runs home on a pair of RBI singles and another on a bases loaded walk.  
LSU then stretched the lead to 
eight in the fourth, scoring first on a two-error play by UF and then later on a single to right field.
Junior Megan Bush came 
through with Florida’s lone run in the bottom of the fourth, hitting her second homer of the tourna-ment on a 1-0 pitch from LSU ace Cody Trahan, who allowed just four hits in her complete-game performance. 
At its outset the game was UF’s 8-game win streak snapped in SEC semifinals
SEE SOfTBALL, p AGE 15
Georgia was the gift that kept 
giving last weekend.
Two ninth-inning errors 
gave away Friday’s game. Two wild pitches bailed out UF’s sluggish of-
fense Saturday. Six consecutive walks 
turned a one-run contest into an eight-run blowout Sunday.
A season-high 14,619 fans came to 
McKethan Stadium to watch the three-game series, but even those wearing 
orange and blue could not feel satisfied 
with the results. Sure, No. 4 UF got its fourth sweep of the season, but how the Gators got that sweep was trou-
bling.
It was the least fun series of the 
season. Seeing the Bulldogs give away game after game was just sad. Even UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan admitted Sun-
day’s choke job was tough to watch.  
The Bulldogs will improve. They lost a record 11 
players to the 
draft last season 
and are just two years removed 
from a runner-
up finish in the College World 
Series.
But what if 
they don’t get better? What if they stay in the Southeastern Conference cellar 
for years? Should SEC fans settle for one boring matchup per season?
No. College sports should take a 
cue from Europeans, who love soccer more than Americans love anything. Lives revolve around the sport, which 
is why Europeans rely on an entertain-
ing relegation system rather than put-
ting every team on equal footing.NCAA should go EuropeanUf TRACK & fIELDMen win SEC Outdoor title

Check out the story on our website.� Gators linebacker Brendan Beal 
has decided to transfer. He is the second defensive player in the last week to announce his intention to leave Gainesville. “We didn’t pitch as well 
as we’re capable of and 
I don’t think we played 
as well on defense as we 
needed to.”
Tim Walton
UF softball coachsince 1976 and ran in the 4x400 re-
lay ream.
“Winning the team title was the 
biggest goal for me,” Taylor said. “I’m happy that we could send people like Calvin (Smith) out – he’s a senior – with this win. I’m 
happy to get a ring and we’ll keep 
moving forward from here.”
The No. 10 women’s team also 
did not disappoint but came up just short in defending last year’s out-
door title and accomplishing the 
track and field “Triple Crown.”
It finished second behind No. 2 
LSU, but claimed five individual 
titles in the meet.
“I thought our women had a 
great meet,” Holloway said. “We 
just got beat by a really talented LSU team that had a great week-
end.” We were a little dinged up 
coming into the meet, but I am ex-tremely proud of how our women’s team performed this weekend.”Shara Proctor won both the long 
jump and triple jump, becoming the first ever three-time winner in the women’s triple jump. “It feels great to win three in a row,” Proc-
tor said. “I wanted to finish my col-
legiate season on a good note, win and help my team.”
Senior thrower Mariam Kevkh-
ishvili won another shot put title, the third of her career, and the first time in over a decade a 
women’s shot putter 
has won three championships in a 
career.
The two other Gators that 
claimed championships during the weekend were runner Charlotte Browning in the 1,500-meter run and Evelien Dekkers in the javelin.
Browning won the title, despite 
the race being her first 1,500-meter run of the outdoor season because of injuries that prevented her ear-lier in the year.TUESDAY, MAY 18, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators host all-Florida 
Regional Thursday
similar to Thursday’s first-round contest against Auburn, 
when the Gators scored only a single run in the first four innings before tallying eight in the fifth to secure a 9-1 run-rule victory. 
But against LSU that offensive explosion never came, 
and the team now has to turn its attention 
to Thursday’s NCAA Regional in which it will host Bethune Cookman, FIU and UCF for a chance at redemption.
“I don’t think it’s easy to ever dismiss 
a loss but you have to,” Walton said. “At this point in time in the season if you sit here and think about this too long it’ll be a long but short postseason so we have 
to do a good job of making sure we re-
bound and regroup.”
Although the Gators drew the fourth overall seed in the 
tournament, their regional will be far from easy as they 
will have to play rematches with a UCF team they needed nine innings to beat on March 31 and an FIU team who defeated the Gators 8-3 on April 20 in Gainesville. SOFTBALL , from page 14The English football league system, for example, is di-
vided into six levels. The 20 best clubs – the Arsenals, the 
Chelseas – play in the Premier League. But at the end of 
the season, the three last-place teams are relegated to the Football League Championship.
Likewise, three teams from the Championship are pro-
moted to the Premiership while three more are relegated to the third-tier league. The result is an intense finish to 
the regular season, regardless of where your team ranks.
Europeans have their share of faults (imperialism, 
Vespa scooters, dental records), but club soccer is not one of them. Imagine how hard Georgia fans would have 
been cheering last weekend if their Bulldogs were fight-ing to not be relegated to Conference USA.
An NCAA relegation system would vary from sport 
to sport since each has a different number of Division-1 teams and conferences. But, for the sake of this column, 
let’s look at baseball.
The 301 Division-1 baseball teams would be divided 
into four groups: southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest. Within each quadrant, teams would be divid-
ed into four levels. The top-tier conferences would have 
16 teams while the three lower conferences would each 
contain 20 squads.
In the southeast, for example, the premier teams com-
pete in the SEC while the other 60 teams play in the At-lantic Coast Conference, the Sun Belt Conference and the Atlantic Sun Conference.
Then, at the end of the season, four teams from the 
ACC get promoted to the SEC and four bottom dwellers are relegated. The four best teams in each conference also 
advance to a tournament, with the first-tier teams com-
peting for the national championship.
The national champions are granted immunity from 
relegation the next season, and the lower-level tourna-ment winners cannot be relegated the next season, pre-venting those teams from mailing in the postseason.
And with a relegation system, smaller schools would 
have an easier time building a strong program. Imagine No. 5 Coastal Carolina replacing last-place Georgia in the 
SEC next season.
That would be a gift fans could really appreciate. TYLER , from page 14

 Patience proved to be a virtue 
for the Gators Sunday.
In a seven-run sixth inning, No. 
4 Florida’s (37-12, 20-7 Southeast-
ern Conference) plate discipline led to six straight walks offered up by three different Georgia 
relief pitchers to break the game 
open in a 9-3 victory over the Bulldogs (14-36, 3-22 SEC) to earn the series sweep.
Florida will look to carry the 
momentum from last weekend into tonight’s game against North Florida (29-22) in McKethan Sta-dium at 6:30.
“They just didn’t have com-
mand and we were patient at the plate and made things happen,” shortstop Nolan Fontana said. “They just were scattering balls everywhere.”
The win allowed UF to keep 
pace with South Carolina, which swept Arkansas during the week-
end, for ﬁ  rst place in the confer-
ence.
Before Sunday’s big frame, 
the Gators’ bats were struggling 
against the Bulldogs. 
They scored just eight earned 
runs in the ﬁ  rst two games com-
bined of the series and only man-aged two through ﬁ  ve innings 
Sunday before Georgia’s melt-
down in the sixth.
Four of the Bulldogs’ six walks 
came with the bases loaded, and 
at one point Georgia’s relief pitch-
ers threw 15 consecutive balls. 
“I don’t even want to talk 
about it, because I don’t want to jinx it,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said. “That’s an awful feeling. 
It’s tough to even watch the other team go through that. Nobody is out there trying to throw balls.”
Junior Bryson Smith, who 
grew up just 20 minutes away from Georgia’s campus, then 
capped the frame off with a two-
run single to right ﬁ  eld to give UF a 9-1 lead in the sixth.
“It was really special. I was a 
(Georgia) fan up until last year 
when I commit-ted,” Smith said. “My family is down here and it 
was kind of tough 
for them to pull 
against Georgia, so it was cool to be a part of.”
UF pitcher Brian Johnson la-
bored on the mound, despite limiting Georgia to just one run in 5.2 innings. He allowed a run-ner to get into scoring position in 
four of the six innings he threw 
in, but Johnson escaped most of the jams.After being penciled into the 
batting order during his last three starts on the mound, John-son was limited to just pitching 
as O’Sullivan did not want him 
doing too much in the 90-degree heat. 
“It’s really not too tough do-
ing both, but I felt like I could cool off and get my breath in between innings because it was kind of hot out there (Sunday),” Johnson said.
The bullpen continued its 
impressive series. Relievers Jeff Barﬁ  eld and Anthony DeSclafani shut down the Bulldogs. The bull-
pen did not allow an earned run 
in 10.2 innings during the week-end series after giving up six last weekend on the road against Ala-bama.
“We’ve got three of those 
guys going out of the bullpen,” O’Sullivan said. “You’ve got (Greg) Larson who has been pitching well as of late, Barﬁ  eld who has been good as of late and now we got DeSclafani going too. 
If we can bridge that gap to (Kev-
in) Chapman, I like how the staff is shaping up.”
Zunino Out Tonight
After dislocating his left thumb 
in Saturday’s game, Zunino was not in the lineup Sunday. That 
won’t change tonight.
The freshman catcher will sit 
out for the second-straight game 
due to the injury. 
“He’s ﬁ  ne. We got a splint for 
that thing. I think it’s just day to day,” O’Sullivan said. “I don’t think it’s anything terribly seri-ous, but we just have to be careful 
with it for sure.”
Ben McMahan, who will likely 
ﬁ  ll in for Zunino in today’s game, 
leads the team with a .396 batting 
average in 48 at-bats.
He went 2 for 4 in place of the 
injured catcher on Sunday.  Plate discipline keys Gators’ sweep of Bulldogs
