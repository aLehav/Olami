President Barack Obama waves as he walks onstage with ﬁ  rst lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha at his election party early Wednesday morning in Chicago.

Once again, it looked like it would 
all come down to Florida.
The state was 50-50 for hours after 
polls closed. 
Even after networks started call-
ing the election for President Barack 
Obama, Florida remained persistent-
ly close.
“My stomach is in knots,” said 
Carly Borden, a 21-year-old UF po-
litical science junior.
But then, about an hour into 
Wednesday morning, it didn’t mat-ter. 
With Florida’s electoral votes still 
in play, Republican nominee Mitt 
Romney conceded, ofﬁ  cially securing 
Obama’s re-election.
When the votes started rolling in 
Tuesday night, it became evident to supporters on both sides of the po-
litical aisle that every vote would in-
deed count.
“I’ve personally called about 5,000 
Floridians,” said Katy Melchiorre, a 
21-year-old political science and tele-
communications senior and UF Col-lege Republicans chairwoman. “So the fact it could come down to 5,000 votes is nerve-wracking.”
Alachua County went to Obama with 57.68 percent — 69,219 votes. 
Romney earned 40.44 percent with 
48,527 votes.
The county became a blue island 
in a Republican sea as county votes 
were announced on blaring televi-
sion screens in bars and homes across the city.
MSNBC called Obama’s victory, 
then CNN and Fox. 
Christina Ford, 20-year-old Gators 
for Obama co-chairwoman, pulled out her phone to conﬁ  rm the pro-jected win on the Obama campaign 
Twitter.
Someone popped a bottle of cham-
pagne and sprayed it over the crowd 
of teary-eyed Obama supporters. Ford, a political science and econom-
ics sophomore, and Gators for Obama 
co-chairwoman Rachel McGovern danced and embraced as “My Girl” by The Temptations blasted over the 
speakers and people joined in chants 
of “Four more years.”
“I know that he’s going to continue 
to look forward to greater equality 
for women, greater equality for the LGBT community,” said McGovern, a 20-year-old political science junior. 
“We’ve been working so hard for this.”
Romney supporters said they 
weren’t surprised that Alachua Coun-Obama secures re-election as Florida remains close
� ALL THREE SEATS WENT TO 
DEMOCRATS.

After almost a year on the cam-
paign trail, the fate of the Alachua 
County Commission rested on a set of 
bar graphs.
With their eyes glued to the screen, 
supporters from the Alachua County Democratic Party watched and waited as the votes trickled in.
In an instant, the bar jumped, and 
cheers echoed through the room. The commission’s Democratic majority was secured for another term.
Out of the three County Commis-
sion races, all of the seats went to Dem-ocrats: Mike Byerly, Robert “Hutch” Hutchinson and Charles “Chuck” 
Chestnut.
With the Democratic Party sweep-
ing the local races, some Republican 
supporters said they look forward to the state and national results. Some 
said they were disappointed the coun-
ty election was a full win for the other party.

For some students, the Alachua 
County Commission may seem like part of government that doesn’t 
touch their daily lives, but the com-mission has a hand in road construc-
tion, transportation projects and 
business initiatives,  such as Innova-tion Gainesville, that impact UF.
During the County Commission 
race, some candidates focused their platforms on being a fiscal conser -
vatism voice on the commission, and some Democratic candidates focused on being discriminate about 
slashing county programs.
Byerly , the incumbent since he 
was elected in 2000, secured his fourth term on the commission with 
62,169 votes — 55.62 percent. His opponent, John Martin, a UF alum-
nus and former Hawthorne City 
Commissioner, gained 44.38 percent with 49,614 votes.
Hutchinson, the executive direc-
tor of the Alachua Conservation Trust, won his district with 64,579 
votes — 58.02 percent. His oppo-nent Jean Calderwood earned 46,480 
votes, securing 41.76 percent of the county.
Chestnut, a former state repre-
sentative and former Gainesville City Commissioner, won a Com-mission seat with 60,087 votes — 53.74 percent. His opponent, Dean 
Cheshire, won 42.87 percent with 
47,929 votes.
Byerly said he is excited to be 
working with Hutchinson and Chestnut on the commission.
“I’m feeling very good about 
having not just their perspective, but I think we’re going to have a good balance on the County Commis-
sion,” he said.
However, he said, the Demo-
cratic commissioners-elect will have Republican opposition.
“I think there is going to be some 
very interesting conversations, but I 
feel good about moving forward,” Byerly said.
Cheshire said that despite the 
loss, he felt great about his campaign and is happy that he can now spend 
time with family.
“This is the single hardest county 
to win as a Republican,” hesaid. “It’s a Hail Mary no matter what.”

At its meeting Tuesday 
night, UF’s Student Senate ap-
proved a resolution in response 
to the Oct. 24 blackface incident 
when two Beta Theta Pi broth-ers painted their bodies black at an off-campus social.
One of the bill’s authors, 
Sen. Truman Williams, said the intent of the resolution is to ed-ucate the Student Body about the issue and give historical 
context. He said some of the 
recommendations made dur -
ing a Town Hall meeting last week should be addressed, but they may not be under Student 
Senate’s jurisdiction.
Sen. Umair Asghar said 
resolutions are nonbinding 
and therefore can include de-mands. Sen. Morgan Vollrath 
agreed with Asghar.“This could get buried next 
year, and never talk about it 
again,” Vollrath said.
During the meeting, Senate 
Cabinet Liaison Andrew Gar -
cia presented a diversity ini-
tiative. The initiative includes 
six Town Hall forums to dis-cuss issues regarding different 
groups such as black/African-
American, LGBTQ, interna-tional, disability, Hispanic/Chicano/Latino and Asian-Pacific Islander.
After the forums, a Diver -
sity Action Plan will be imple-mented.
Senate President Christina 
Bonarrigo said that as elected 
representatives of students, 
the Senate has to respond to problems that may arise. She said she hopes the action plan 
will be released by Spring se-
mester.
The first Town Hall meet-
ing, which will be about LG-
BTQ issues, will be Nov. 28.

Fewer students voted at the Reitz Union than in the 2008 election
ty went to Obama.
“University of Florida as a whole is more liberal, and 
that attributes Alachua County going to Obama,” said 
Nick Boley, a 21-year-old industrial and systems engi-
neering senior. “I’m not surprised.”
But the national vote was another story.After Fox News called Obama the winner, a group of 
about 10 Gators for Romney students shared a round of Blue Moon beers as a couple of students shed tears at the Salty Dog Saloon.As the young Republicans waited 
for the Florida election results to roll in, they said they couldn’t help but feel dis-
mayed.
“Just to come up short like this, to all 
the people that have worked on this, is 
disappointing,” said Frank Moehrle, 21-year-old Gators for Romney chair -
man and political science senior.
As in the 2008 election, various groups emphasized 
student voting as essential in this race. 
For the Reitz Union, an all-student precinct, 3,432 peo-ple voted — fewer than 2008’s 3,923 votes.
For Obama supporters, this night meant more than num-
bers. It meant months of hard work and support paid off.
Ford spent countless hours on the campaign because, 
she said, she felt this was the best use of her time — bet-
ter than end-of-semester parties or even her college tran-script. 
“I’ve given up my social life, grades, everything, and it 
was all worth it,” Ford said. “This will have an impact way 
past my college years.”

with the results of the election?
Tuesday’s question: Who are 
you voting for? The day after the election with Obama
As I started to write this column on Election Day, 
polls were open and votes were coming in. By the time this is printed, very early Tuesday 
morning,  we will most likely know who will be inau-gurated in January as president of the United States. 
The next president will face a variety of issues from day 
one. From dealing with automatic budget cuts and tax re-
form, to managing a hyper-partisan Congress, the com-mander in chief will have to get to work immediately to avoid ﬁ  scal crisis.
By the time I wrote this, the campaign had long 
reached its climax and had essentially concluded.
Disclaimer: I recognize that should I be proven 
wrong, this piece will be wholly irrelevant. If that is the 
case, do not hesitate to regard this as another “Dewey 
defeats Truman” moment.  
Approaching Election Day, I expected President Ba-
rack Obama to remain in the White House.
Yes, I remain ﬁ  rm in my belief that momentum 
gradually shifted toward Gov. Mitt Romney since the ﬁ  rst debate, and I would be surprised if he didn’t win Florida. 
However, with respect to the Electoral College, 
Obama has too diverse a path to victory, while Romney must win the majority of swing states, including Ohio, which no victor in several election cycles has lost. Polls in Ohio shifted toward the President Monday, accord-
ing to the New York Times. 
We can all agree that the Obama campaign’s tremen-
dous voter registration efforts and national organiza-
tion has played a large role in his re-election. This effort has undermined the opposition’s attempt to paint him 
as a failed incumbent in light of former President Jimmy 
Carter.
The fallen potential of the Romney campaign could 
be attributed to the bitter Republican primary process 
in which the GOP nominee pandered to a volatile plat-form for far too long. Having 
been under constant attack for nearly two years, both Repub-
licans and Democrats success-
fully put constant doubt of Romney’s political positions in the minds of voters.
As such, the president has 
an advantage as the incumbent. 
Beneﬁ  ting from an extended general election rather than being torn down by an extended nomination pro-cess, Obama seems to have been uplifted by a united 
Democratic party in addition to gradual progress with 
respect to the marginal improvements in the job market and in consumer conﬁ  dence.
There is no time for celebration, however.
The President must get back to work instead of re-
maining the “campaigner in chief,” as his opposition 
may label him. America has made progress, but the na-tion still has a long way to go to repair partisan divi-sions in rebuilding our economy.  
I hope that Republicans will work with President 
Obama. I hope that President Obama will work with Republicans.
There is no denying that Republicans, like Romney, 
have tangible and meaningful experience to offer anoth-er Obama administration. Romney’s trademark state-ment, “I’ve worked in the private sector, I know how the economy works,” should not be overlooked.  We can all agree that to unite the nation and solve our issues, 
we must compromise on legislation development.
It would be encouraging to see the Obama admin-
istration and Republicans reach out to one another to 
overcome our nation’s challenges.
After all, that’s change we really should believe in.Matthew Schnur is an economics freshman at UF. His 
column appears on Wednesdays.
Hope and Change 
How Obama won 
our hearts
Twas November the seventh, day after elections,
America was represented, all of the sections!
The votes had been cast in the system with care
 In hopes that Obama soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their classes,
While visions of binders scared all the lasses.And mom in her apron, and I in my suitHad just settled down to look at our Halloween loot.
When out on North Lawn, there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.Away to the window, I threw open the blindsTo see tons of people standing in lines!
First Sandy stole gas from the Jersey Shore,
Then people who voted found it quite a chore.When, what to my wondering ears should appear,Tons of Americans who gave quite a cheer!
They were led by Obama, jumpin’ and jivin’,
Next to him smiling sat good ol’ Joe Biden.Led by two eagles, and that cute dog Bo,
On all their shirts was a big, giant ‘O.’
Away they all walked, headed north to Washington
Where they knew they wouldn’t be greeted with stones.So up to D.C., they all took a walk,To hard work or a challenge, they did not balk.
From health care to human rights, Obama took a stand.
For that we’re very grateful — give him a hand!
Sasha and Malia must both be so proud;
If he was our dad, we’d announce it aloud!
From Twitter to Facebook, the youth won the vote.
We earned it, dear reader, take a moment to gloat.No need to be scared of the almost nightmareOf the man who’s a robot that dyes its hair.
We’re saved from the possible Romney curse;
Obama is better and deﬁ  nitely not worse.
He’ll give us better Pell grants and health care to boot,He’ll provide us with hurricane supplies, so we don’t have  
 to loot.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to work,And ﬁ  led all the bills, then turned with a jerk.And laying his ﬁ  nger aside of his nose,And giving a nod, up the White House chimney he rose!
He sprang to Air Force One, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all ﬂ  ew without even launching a missile.But we heard him exclaim before they had left,“Many thanks, all you young people! Especially UF!

The Associated Press recently reported that, as a 
result of a four-year boom in oil production, the United States could surpass Saudi Arabia as the 
world’s largest producer of oil. This news comes dur -
ing a time when Americans are increasingly concerned about oil prices and stability in the Middle East.
Energy independence has long been a rallying cry 
for politicians who claim to support American national security. This phrase has become synonymous with a variety of initiatives, namely the escalation of domestic drilling as embodied by the 2008 Republican campaign slogan “drill, baby, drill,” as well as ongoing efforts to 
pioneer efficient and cost-effective alternative energy 
sources. However, through all of this, the U.S. has, out of necessity, been forced to import a large amount of its oil.
Though much has been said about the supply of oil 
in the Middle East, the largest exporter of oil to the U.S. is Canada, providing nearly a billion barrels of oil so far in 2012 compared to the 436 million barrels from Saudi Arabia.
Nonetheless, U.S. dependence on foreign oil still 
poses a major national security threat, and the news that the U.S. has experienced its fourth straight increase in annual oil production provides U.S. planners with a 
variety of options.
This should not be interpreted as an opening for 
complacency when it comes to investing in alternative 
energy sources.
With an increase in domestic production, about 11.4 
million barrels a day, the domestic need, 18 million bar -
rels a day, will increasingly be met by domestic produc-tion. This means that more and more money spent on oil will be pumped into the U.S. economy, with obvious 
benefits to the American population.
However, this also means that, as oil prices drop 
and the fear of dependence on oil from the Middle East 
recedes, there will be a decrease in public pressure on politicians and the private sector to come up with effec-
tive and cost-efficient alternative energy sources and to 
discover new sources of domestic petroleum.
As college students, the events that transpire today 
in regards to America’s energy policy will have signifi-
cant and long-lasting consequences in our adult years.
Whether we progress on a path toward finding alter -
native energy sources to, at first, coexist with petroleum 
and then replace it or become complacent with falling oil prices and rising independence, our choice will heavily weigh on our ability to sustain ourselves when the world’s oil production reaches its Hubbert 
peak. Therefore, we must be pro-
active to avoid the devastating 
effects of this peak to the world’s oil supplies.
The breathing room that will be provided by greater 
independence and greater domestic oil production must be converted into research into alternative energies so that this breathing room can continue into the future.
Therefore, the new flow of wealth that will be divert-
ed from international markets to the domestic economy 
must be used to supplement existing funding for re-
search into alternative energy sources. The basic rule of capitalism is that when there is a demand for a product, the supply for that product will respond accordingly.
Thus, the first step to achieving any form of true en-
ergy independence based on the short-term combina-tion of petroleum and alternative energy sources is to continue to provide this demand on the market.
Throughout the past decade, automobile fuel effi-
ciency has increased. Hybrid cars have become more commonplace and solar panels, windmills, hydroelec-tric plants and nuclear reactors have increasingly taken a larger role in satisfying America’s energy needs.
To complement the increase in research and public 
interest in alternative energy sources, we need a mas-sive investment in America’s electric grid. The current grid is largely outdated and inefficient.
To provide for the dramatically growing energy 
needs of the American public, and to supplant trans-portation inefficiencies — a major obstacle to the effec-tive implementation of alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and hydroelectric because of their need to 
be at appropriate, and often remote, sites — that come 
from transporting electricity, the American electric grid must be updated and renovated to include the most ad-vanced technologies so that it may efficiently distribute power throughout the country.
American oil production is increasing, and with this 
increase will come many benefits to the American econ-omy, its national security and foreign policy; however, this good fortune cannot be met with complacency but 
instead with an increased determination to extend the 
benefits of energy independence and sustainability into the future.

Have you ever heard the phrase “Let the Gator 
Growl?” How about “the largest student-run pep  rally in the nation?”
To many people, these are simply the common 
phrases heard on campus each year at Homecoming time.
But for the students who attend Gator Growl annu-
ally, it means the most unique Homecoming experi-ence in the country, and it belongs to them as Florida Gators.
We can spend hours detailing what the show has 
for you (skydivers, UF cheerleaders, the Dazzlers, a 
chance to see Tracy Morgan and Josh Turner perform 
live, student-produced skits and more), but the feel-ing can’t be explained.
We have not one, but two events in the stadium 
in one weekend. A stage is built in a week and taken down in 12 hours. It’s a time when the famous come to Gainesville, and the Gators are the stars of the show.
It’s not for only our athletes. It’s for the dancers, 
the singers, the performers — all Gators. Get ready for 
a show by students, for students. (OK, and for alumni, 
but they were students once, too).
For $15, come check it out before you knock it.There’s no event in the country like Gator Growl, 
and it’s directly on campus.
As a senior at UF, I’ve finally learned what Home-
coming is about. This week is the ultimate experience for the Gator Nation. There’s one reason to celebrate, and it’s simply that we’re the best — the orange and 
blue — and nothing will ever change that.
This year, we’ll also have a unique opportunity to 
celebrate our nation’s heroes for Veterans Day. With 
ROTC members as ushers, cameos from Gators serv-
ing overseas and Wounded Warriors in the audience, 
we will spend the night hon-
oring those people who serve and have served our country. If you buy a Gator Growl ticket, 
you will help us reach 32,500 in 
ticket sales. Gator Growl aims 
to donate $25,000 to the Wounded Warrior Project.
After an intense election season, we’ll finally come 
together under one president and stand united not only for the Gator Nation, but for the United States. Get ready for the Independence Day in Gainesville twice in one year. (Who doesn’t love that?)
Medal of Honor recipient and Gainesville resident 
Cpl. Duane E. Dewey will kick off the weekend as the grand marshal of the UF Homecoming Parade Fri-day at noon on University Avenue. Following Gator Growl, which is Friday at 7 p.m. in Ben Hill Grif-
fin Stadium, join the university community for the 
Homecoming Alumni barbecue at 10 a.m. Saturday before the game. We’ll have the entire tailgate experi-ence plus barbecue from 4 Rivers Smokehouse for $10. I also hope you’ll celebrate Homecoming in your own 
way this week.
Attend an event hosted by your organization, wear 
red, white, orange and blue, and take the night off 
from studying to enjoy a movie.
It’s Homecoming, it’s a holiday and it’s time to cel-
ebrate.

Homecoming events, visit www.gatorgrowl.org or www.facebook.com/GatorGrowlUF

In light of the recent time change, 
the University Police Department 
urges UF students to use bicycle lights for safety.
State laws require that a bicycle 
used between sunset and sunrise must have a front light visible from 500 feet and a lamp and red reflec-tor on the back visible from 600 feet, said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Bar -
ber.
“Beyond the legal requirement, it 
is for visibility,” Barber said.
A nonmoving violation costs 
$104, Sgt. Kristy Maculan said. A moving violation, in which the bicy-clist is fined for acts such as running a stop sign or operating in the wrong direction of traffic, costs $154.
UPD swept through campus 
Monday night, Maculan said. Dur -
ing that time, police issued 52 writ-
ten warnings for bike light viola-
tions. She said police also registered 26 bikes.
Typically , students who commit 
a bike infraction on campus initially receive a warning, Barber said. Fol-lowing incidents can become cita-tions.
Cyclists, like drivers, must fol-
low the rules of the road, which in-clude stopping at red lights and stop signs.
“A lot of people don’t recognize 
that a bicycle is considered a vehicle in the State of Florida,” Barber said.
Kerrie Durham, a linguistics 
freshman, bought a bike light about a month into this semester. The 
18-year-old said she shines a light 
on herself while riding at night so it is easier for others to see her.
Loren Humphrey , an 18-year-old 
aerospace engineering freshman, said it is important that drivers and bikers can see each other while on the road.
“You should probably have a 
couple of bike lights at night,” she said. “And maybe don’t go as fast.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2012

� THIS WILL BE THE 
FOURTH LION FOR THE HOUSE.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Writer
Groups of students who 
walked by the Sigma Alpha 
Epsilon fraternity house Mon-
day afternoon weren’t all talk-
ing about the Gators. Some gossiped about a different ani-mal — the missing lion.
According to SAE President 
Nathan Kenney, the fraternity will replace Leo the lion stat-ue. Leo has been outside the house for about 20 years.
“It had no nose or tail,” 
said Kenney, a 21-year-old food science and human nu-trition senior. “Parts of it were 
held together by the layers of 
paint.”
He said the fraternity or -
dered its new brass-and-steel lion, which will be the fourth one outside of the house, from 
a company in China. It was 
supposed to arrive for Home-coming this weekend, but it was shipped through New York and was delayed due to Hurricane Sandy.
It will be a little bigger than 
the previous lion and will cost about $8,500, Kenney said. SAE alumni raised most of the money, with a few of the funds coming from active members.
Kenney said they plan to 
have a ceremony with alumni this weekend to honor the new lion.
He said that Leo is a mascot 
for the fraternity and a way to differentiate the house from others.
“It’s a landmark,” he said. 
“I tell people, ‘It’s the house 
with the lion in the front.’”
Will Simpson, a 21-year-
old industrial and systems 
engineering junior and SAE 
brother, said Leo guards the 
fraternity house.
“It’s more of something that 
brings us together,” he said.
The brothers paint the 
lion for social events, football games and holidays, Kenney said. SAE plans to prime the 
new lion so the brotherhood 
can continue to paint it for events.
Leo will be back in the front 
yard next week for all the stu-
dents who are used to its ma-
jestic glance and bright colors.
“It’s our unique way of de-
fining our chapter,” Kenney 
said.

Tommy Scott can barely sleep when it’s 
cold outside.
Scott, 56, was recently in the hospital 
for two weeks because he slept outside 
and didn’t have enough blankets to keep him warm and keep his asthma at bay.
Whenever St. Francis House offers 
cold-night shelter, he makes sure to stay overnight.
Organizations keep homeless people 
warm and safe during the cold nights. 
While the temperature drops and the 
crisp winter wind breezes through, the amount of supplies to assist the homeless change daily, according to local commu-nity ofﬁ  cials.
Scott slept at the shelter during cold 
nights for the past two years.
“I’m always treated really good,” he 
said.
He said that in the past when the tem-
perature was about 20 to 35 degrees, the shelter ran out of cots to give out.
“It got so goddamn full,” he said.  The room ﬁ  lled with men and women 
separated by a divider, he said.
Scott said he plans to stay at St. Francis 
for the next couple of nights because it’s going to be cold.Temperatures will dip into the low 40s 
over the next few nights.
He said he thinks many of the people 
who sleep on Bo Diddley Community Plaza and in “Tent City” will follow suit.
The City of Gainesville/Alachua Coun-
ty Ofﬁ  ce on Homelessness replenished its supplies after running out of jackets to give to the homeless last week. 
When the ofﬁ  ce reached out to the city, 
people responded by helping out and do-nating, said Theresa Lowe, director of the City of Gainesville/Alachua County Of-
ﬁ  ce on Homelessness.
“This has been a community partner-
ship,” Lowe said.
The ofﬁ  ce gives away blankets, socks 
and scarves.    
Jackets are given away daily. 
In the past two weeks, the organization 
gave about 50 to 60 jackets, she said.
St. Francis House provides cold-night 
shelter for the homeless when the temper-ature is 45 degrees or lower.
Kent Vann, executive director at St. 
Francis House, said the cold-night shel-ter provides a person who doesn’t have 
anywhere to stay a safe and warm place 
to sleep.
“This saves lives,” Vann said. “A freeze 
warning can cost a life.”
The shelter houses 35 people, but dur-
ing cold-night temperatures, an additional 40 to 60 people stay the night, he said.
Guests check in by 8 p.m., and they re-
ceive a green cot, blankets and coffee.
In the morning, about 30 volunteers 
and six staffers provide the guests with a hot breakfast including eggs, bacon, pas-tries or oatmeal.
“The people are good, and they are ap-
preciative of the services,” he said.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Quarterback Jeff Driskel signals to the Gators’ offense in Florida’s 14-7 win against Missouri on 
Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. UF went to a hurry-up attack on its ﬁ  rst two possessions. 
� OPPONENTS HAVE 
OUTGAINED THE GATORS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF EVERY GAME THIS SEASON. 
  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  In response to a streak of slow 
starts, the Gators are picking up 
the pace. 
  On Saturday’s ﬁ  rst play from 
scrimmage, quarterback Jeff Driskel found Trey Burton in the ﬂ  at to his left for a 6-yard gain. 
  Immediately after the play 
ended, Driskel began shouting directions and signaling with his hands. 
Without huddling, Florida 
lined up in an empty set, and Driskel found Frankie Hammond Jr. on a slant route for an 8-yard gain. 
  Using an increased tempo, UF 
opened the game with an eight-play, 28-yard drive — its best opening possession since Sept. 8, when Florida drove 75 yards in 
13 plays against Texas A&M. 
  Given the early success on 
Saturday, offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease said the Gators will 
likely employ the strategy again. 
  “We’ve always worked on it, 
and we’ve always had it,” Pease 
said. 
“It loosened them up and got 
some energy in our kids.”
  Florida revisited the hurry-up 
on its second possession. After Driskel hit Jordan Reed 
on a curl route for a 4-yard gain to start the possession, the Gators rushed back to the line. 
But Driskel was tackled for no 
gain on a scramble attempt, and a Missouri defensive lineman bat-ted down his third-down pass to an open Reed. 
  “I wish we would have been 
a little more consistent with [the no-huddle offense],” Pease said. “I wish we would have had a 
couple more completions. It was 
effective for what we wanted.”
  The change in tempo was 
meant to spur a fast start. Florida has been outgained in the ﬁ  rst 
quarter of every game this sea-
son. 
On average, the Gators have 
gained only 47.1 yards in the ﬁ  rst 
quarter, compared to 85 yards for 
their opponents. 
  “We do have to start better,” 
Driskel said. 
“The offense has to be more 
productive. … We went no-hud-dle this week to kind of get our tempo going, because we kind of move the ball better when we 
have a good tempo.”
  Driskel said the shift to a hur-
ry-up can make it easier to read 
defenses. 
With limited time to prepare 
before the snap, defenders have a difﬁ  cult time making checks and usually end up playing more va-nilla concepts.  Florida taking up-tempo approach to cure slow starts

  Florida offensive coordinator Brent Pease is a 
candidate to take the head coaching job at Kentucky 
next season, but don’t hold your breath for a quick decision.
  “I’m not going to approach it in-season at all,” 
Pease said. “If the opportunity comes up afterward, I’d do whatever’s appropriate at that time.”
  Pease, a career assistant, said he would listen 
if any head coaching offers come his way . He has worked as an offensive coordinator at four FBS schools: Kentucky, Baylor, Boise State and Florida.
  “You always visit with people,” Pease said. 
“That’s what we’re in the profession for.”
  Should Pease entertain job offers this offseason, 
he would have the support of Gators coach Will Muschamp, who has already lost one offensive co-ordinator to a head coaching job during his tenure at Florida. Charlie Weis accepted an offer to take the helm at Kansas after calling plays in Gainesville last season.
  “Brent certainly is an outstanding football coach,” 
Muschamp said. “Any opportunity he has as a head coach, I know that I will fully endorse that.”
  The Wildcats announced the ﬁ  ring of coach Jok-
er Phillips on Monday. Phillips is 12-23 with a 4-19 Pease noncommittal on UK opening  
SEE NOTES, PAGE 15JURNY DUTY
    Will Muschamp is not 
changing anything.
  It’s OK if he tells the 
media that, but it shouldn’t actually 
be the case.
  He’ll publicly respect Florida’s 
next two opponents — Louisi-
ana and Jacksonville State — but it should not go any further than 
that.
  “It’s all the same to me,” Mus-
champ said of preparation for this 
weekend’s game against Louisiana. 
“This is a good football team com-
ing in here. Having recruited in the 
state of Louisiana, where most of 
their players are from, and south 
Mississippi, they’ve got really good 
skilled people who can run and play. The offense that they have cre-ates issues for us de-
fensively.”
  B u t  
F l o r i d a 
won’t have 
any issues 
defensive-ly.
  Yes, the Ragin’ Cajuns have the 
44th-ranked offense in the coun-
try , but they put up those numbers 
playing in  the Sun Belt Conference. 
The UF defense ranks ﬁ  fth nation-
ally after completing its Southeast-
ern Conference slate.
  The defense alone can win this 
game for the Gators. 
Saturday could be a repeat of Gators should air it out  
SEE JOSH, PAGE 15“If the opportunity comes up after-
ward, I’d do whatever’s appropriate at 
that time.”

VOLLEYBALL
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
Thanks to Ziva Recek, the 
Gators have to make more room 
on their mantel.
The Southeastern Conference 
named Recek its Freshman of the Week for the third time this year and the second straight week on 
Monday after her career weekend 
against Georgia and Tennessee.
Florida’s leader in kills tal-
lied 38 in the past two matches to bring her total on the season to 317. 
Recek, who is one of only three 
Gators to play in each of the team’s 81 sets, has averaged 3.91 kills per set. That mark is the fourth-highest 
average in the SEC.Most of her production last 
weekend came in the Gators’ loss 
to the Volunteers on Sunday,  when she recorded a career-high 26 kills and 20 digs.
Coach Mary Wise said she 
hasn’t seen a performance like Re-cek’s in a while.
“We haven’t had a player re-
cord 26 kills since 2005,” Wise said. 
“Ziva has been more than solid for 
us all season. Great players have that ability to go to another gear.”
Recek became the first UF play-
er to record at least 26 kills in a match since Jane Collymore had 30 on Sept. 10, 2005. She also was the first Gator to have at least 20 kills and 20 digs in a single match since 
Kisya Killingsworth registered 23 kills and 20 digs against South Carolina on Sept. 17, 2006.
Recek’s record-setting weekend 
puts her in the same conversation 
as former Gators great and All-
American Kelly 
Murphy. 
Recek has 
three SEC Fresh-man of the Week 
awards as well 
as an SEC Of-fensive Player of the Week award, 
which mirrors Murphy’s accom -
plishments during her freshman year in 2008. Murphy went on to win SEC Freshman of the Year and  was the consensus National Fresh-
man of the Year.Before Recek, the 6-foot outside 
hitter, earned her latest award, 
Murphy and former All-American Elyse Cusack were the only Gators to have accumulated four confer -
ence honors in one season. 
As a team, Florida has racked up 
six weekly honors so far this sea-son. Two weeks ago, Chloe Mann was the SEC Offensive Player of 
the Week and Taylor Unroe was 
the conference’s Defensive Player of the Week.
The Gators have already 
eclipsed last year’s squad, which earned just four weekly awards.
The last time Florida had an 
offensive player, defensive player and freshman of the week was 
2010.Wise said she credits the play 
of the veterans that lead the team 
through the day-to-day grind.
“What we do is rely on the lead-
ership of the older players,” Wise 
said. “They want to get back in the 
gym right away.”
Behind the leadership of Betsy 
Smith and Tangerine Wiggs, the Gators have racked up six weekly 
awards and the top spot in the SEC 
standings.
Wise said Florida is close to 
where it wants to be at this point 
in the year.
“Our goal every year is to be 
playing our best volleyball at 
the end of the season,” she said. “I think we have a chance to do 
that.”
Freshman outside hitter continues to rack up SEC accolades  
Recek
“We like it a lot,” Driskel said. 
“It’s nice to see what they’re doing and 
that they’re going to stay in their base cov-
erages.”
The up-tempo approach also gives UF 
an opportunity to get a few of its little-used 
offensive weapons more involved. 
Running back Matt Jones played three 
snaps and gained 5 yards on two carries during Florida’s opening drive. Pease said the freshman’s hands have made him a valuable option in the team’s backfield ro-
tation. 
The Gators also rotate receivers in the 
hurry-up offense. 
Rather than asking a player who ran a 
fly route to sprint back to the line of scrim-
mage and be ready for the next play, the coaches can sub him out for a fresher op-tion. 
Pease said the mechanics of running the 
hurry-up are relatively simple, especially given the time the Gators devote to it in practice. 
“It’s something that we’ve worked on a 
lot,” Driskel said. “We feel really comfort-able with it.”
But the up-tempo approach comes with 
a possible downside. 
If Florida’s offense rushes through a 
three-and-out, its defense will have to re-turn to the field before it has an opportu-nity to catch its breath. 
This prevents Pease from running a hur -
ry-up offense if the opponent’s offense just sustained a long drive.  
“If you go no-huddle and go three-
and-out, they’re right back on the field,” Driskel said. “You kind of have to get into 
a groove.”

Pease’s history in Lexington, Ky ., has 
fueled speculation that he might replace Phillips. Pease served as UK’s offensive co-ordinator from 2001-02.
“It’s a good program,” Pease said of 
Kentucky . “They’ve got great people. They’ve got a great program, and the facil-ities are good. They’re committed to win-ning, and they have won. They won when we were there, when I was there on staff. 
They won when Rich Brooks was there. 
You can get good kids there.”
Sandy’s effect on Gators: The lights will 
not come on at Josh Evans’ house. More than a week after Hurricane Sandy hit New Jersey, Evans’ family is without power.
“It was very scary,” he said.Evans had the storm on his mind dur -
ing Florida’s 14-7 win against Missouri on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. Evans led the Gators with 12 tackles and grabbed a fourth-quarter interception that ended the Tigers’ last-ditch effort to tie the game.
“I kind of had a chip on my shoulder this 
weekend … to go out there and play hard-er for my family and the struggle they’re 
going through,” Evans said. “The lives we 
lost back in New Jersey, New York (and) 
Connecticut had me a little emotional over 
this weekend to go out there and just play 
my heart out. It’s been tough.”
Also affected by the storm were the 
families of Dominique Easley of Staten Is-land, N.Y., and Jordan Reed of New Lon-don, Conn.
Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray said 
he and Easley talked about the junior de-fensive end’s family and the condition of 
Staten Island in the aftermath of Hurricane 
Sandy.
“They went a couple days without 
power,” McCray said. “The city’s flooded, the streets (are) flooded and everything like that. Stuff that we went through a cou-ple years ago when the hurricanes came through.”
Sturgis may be limited: Caleb Sturgis 
(right ankle) is probable for Saturday’s game against Louisiana, but the extent of his role remains uncertain.Due to swelling on Sturgis’ kicking 
ankle that popped up during practice last 
week, the Gators may reduce the Lou Gro-
za Award semifinalist’s field-goal range against the Ragin’ Cajuns. Usually, Sturgis attempts field goals as long as 52 yards. 
“It’s something that [special teams coor -
dinator D.J. Durkin] always lets us know,” Pease said. “There’s communication on the headphones on where we need to get to. So, it varies. We know what Caleb’s range 
is consistently, but if there’s wind, there’s 
wind. If it’s a different kicker, it’s probably not as far as Caleb’s.”
Sturgis attempted just one field goal — 
a blocked 47-yard attempt — against Mis-souri. Brad Phillips handled kickoffs and missed a 24-yard field goal attempt in the fourth quarter.
Headset jargon: When asked about his 
Saturday headset conversations with Mus-champ, Pease laughed. Muschamp tones down his sideline demeanor when talking with coaches during games, according to Pease.
“He’s good,” Pease said. “He listens, 
and he might say things here and there 
and give us some clues on what we’re see-
ing. Some coaches chat a lot, but he doesn’t do that. Sometimes I don’t even know he’s there.”

tor.org.UF’s win against South Carolina, with a few 
forced turnovers giving Florida the edge from the get-go.
For that reason, the offense needs to get out 
of its comfort zone the next two weeks and throw the ball at least half of the time.
The Gators have run the ball on 68 per -
cent of their offensive plays this season. If the 
coaches feel that imbalance will serve them best against No. 8 Florida State on Nov. 24, 
then that is what they should do the next two weeks. However, that is not likely the case. 
The Seminoles boast the nation’s top-
ranked overall defense, which is third against the run. FSU has consistently taken away the opposition’s ground game more than any oth-
er team Florida has faced this season. 
Not developing a better passing game will 
only make it easier for the Seminoles, who won’t hesitate to move their safeties close to 
the line of scrimmage.
“The thing it really does is make it tough 
on your receivers, because they have to block 
those guys that are so much lower,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said of safeties in the 
box. “Or it makes it easier on them that we’re 
going over the top of them like we did on the one to Frankie (Hammond Jr.).”
Pease was referring to Hammond’s ne-
gated 43-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s 14-7 win against 
Missouri. The completion shows that even 
though the Gators struggle to pass block and 
their talent at receiver is average at best, they 
can still make plays in the air. The unit just hasn’t done so often.
Unless the situation dictates that a run is 
the only logical option, Pease should focus on getting quarterback Jeff Driskel and the receivers as many downfield passing plays as 
possible.
Even though the end-of-season showdown 
with the rival Seminoles is more important 
than these two games, the Gators probably don’t have many cards left to put on the table. 
If there are a few plays that haven’t been used, then by all means save them. But everything 
else needs to be refined. 
Florida has the 118th-ranked passing of-
fense in the country . 
Conversely, Louisiana ranks 118th in pass 
defense.
If there was ever a week for the Gators 
to go all-in and work through their passing struggles, this is it.

Coach Billy Donovan signals to his team during Florida’s 101-71 exhibition win 
against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 1 in the O’Connell Center. 
� CASEY PRATHER HAS SUFFERED TWO 
CONCUSSIONS IN THE PAST NINE DAYS. 
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
After a concussion knocked Casey Prather out 
of UF’s scrimmage against Rollins on Oct. 27, he 
suffered another concussion on Monday.
The junior forward’s second head injury in 
nine days occurred when Patric Young elbowed 
him during a rebound attempt in practice.
“It was just a normal play ,” Young said. “I just 
jumped for the ball, and I guess I hit him.”
Prather will miss No. 10 Florida’s season open-
er against Georgetown on Friday in the Navy-
Marine Corps Classic in Jacksonville, coach Billy Donovan said. 
Donovan added that Prather’s second concus-
sion is not believed to be as severe as his first. 
“He has to go through a series of baseline 
tests,” Donovan said. “I felt like with Casey’s (first) injury, I knew he was going to be back for this game.”
In 2011-12, Prather averaged two points and 1.8 rebounds per contest. He averaged only 9.5 minutes in 28 games last season but is expected to have an increased role this year once healthy . 
Prather missed UF’s exhibition against Nebras-
ka-Kearney on Thursday before doctors cleared him to rejoin the team in practice on Monday. 
Freshman Michael Frazier II flourished on the 
wing while redshirt senior Mike Rosario strug-
gled in Prather’s absence.
Frazier scored a team-high 21 points on 8-for-
10 shooting after coming off the bench. 
As the starting small forward, Rosario record-
ed four turnovers against four points, going 0 for 
3 from beyond the arc. 
With Rosario and Frazier as its primary options 
at small forward, Florida will have to play small at times against a long and athletic Georgetown 
frontcourt. Four of the Hoyas’ projected starters 
are at least 6 feet 8 inches tall. 
Donovan has also entertained the possibility 
of playing Will Yeguete, Erik Murphy and Young together. Donovan said he is worried about how such a lineup would function offensively. 
“We have to look at that now just because of 
Casey’s situation,” Donovan said. “We have not done that a lot.”Junior forward to miss opener
