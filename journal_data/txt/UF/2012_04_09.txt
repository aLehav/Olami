� THE BLAZE CAUSED ABOUT $400,000 IN DAMAGE.

Joleen King snatched her 4-year-old daughter and ran into 
the burning hallway.
People rushed door-to-door, warning others to get out.
As King, 23, bolted down the stairs, ﬂ  ames raged above her 
and engulfed the third story and most of the second. She said she lost all of her belongings in the ﬁ  re, even her cellphone and 
shoes.
“Everything was in ﬂ  ames,” she said later Saturday . “It was 
scary.”
Above her, neighbors jumped from the third and second 
ﬂ  oors. Others tossed their babies to residents on the ground be-
cause not even the stairs were safe.
The ﬁ  re displaced 31 residents at Building O of Majestic 
Oaks Apartments, 5800 SW 20th Ave. The blaze possibly start-ed in a trash can on the third ﬂ  oor of Building O at about 3 
p.m. Saturday, said Harry Collins, assistant chief for Alachua County Fire Rescue.
It caused about $400,000 worth of damage, he said.
Neighbors said almost everyone from the third ﬂ  oor went 
the hospital.
Collins said emergency workers took two people to Shands 
at UF to be treated for non-life-threatening injuries after they 
jumped from the building. He said at least four children were tossed to neighbors on the ground, but no one was hurt.
During the chaos, a neighbor passed his daughter from the 
blazing third ﬂ  oor to Mark Riley , a second-ﬂ  oor resident. Riley held tight to his neighbor’s 4-year-old daughter and passed her 
along to neighbors on the ground, his ﬁ  ancee told the Alliga-
tor.
He helped another woman jump to the ground. Then, he

A new iPhone application called UF 
Wi-Fi will allow students and faculty 
to easily access UF Internet from their phones by removing the hassle of re-peated logins.
Nick Groome, a 20-year-old mechani-
cal engineering sophomore, created the application to make accessing UF wire-less Internet faster.
The app allows people to log in with 
their GatorLink credentials once and avoid re-entering the information every time they go to a new location on cam-pus.
The app is simple. To connect to UF 
Internet, users choose the option that al-lows the app to remember a username and password.
Groome developed the app because 
he was tired of having to constantly log in to the UF network.
The application costs 99 cents and is 
now available in Apple’s App Store.
The UF Wi-Fi app allows users to in-
stantly access E-Learning, ISIS, Facebook and Google. Groome plans on adding other features as updates, which are free. 
UF Wi-Fi is the second app Groome 
has designed. He created one called “Ki-nematic equations Solver” in 2011.Mobile app eliminates

Former Sen. Bob Graham wants Florida 
university students to get angry.
The former Florida governor has spoken 
out vehemently against the legislature’s bud-
get cuts to the State University System, which 
total $300 million.   
Now, Graham wants university administra-
tors to make students aware of the impact the 
cuts will have on them, and he wants students to make their voices heard in Tallahassee.
“This is a disaster for Florida,” Graham said 
of schools having to dip into their reserves to balance budget reductions.
Although he hopes to get faculty and alum-
ni on board with lobbying Gov. Rick Scott to veto the cuts, “I think the students have the most at risk,” Graham said.
To get legislators to listen, university ad-
ministrators ﬁ  rst need to get the word out to students. Then, students need to get involved by contacting the governor.
If Scott approves the budget cuts, Graham 
said, it could be more difﬁ  cult for Florida uni-versities to borrow funds in the future. Higher tuition and fees are already being used to sup-plant state funding, similar to the way lottery money was used.
Part of the funding problem in Florida is 
that legislators don’t have their priorities in order, said Graham, who believes the educa-
tion system is the most important entity that 
requires state money and should be the last to take budget cuts.
If you have to make a choice between cut-
ting the State University System’s budget by $300 million or discontinuing a tax break for a special-interest company that sells cigarettes, Graham said, there shouldn’t be a question about what’s better for the public.

speak out against budget cuts
“Hopefully, it will make 
people’s everyday life easier.”

Smoke filled the 
Gainesville sky Sunday be-
cause of a fire about 90 miles north, and authorities are advising drivers on all road-
ways in Alachua County , 
including Interstate 75, to be careful during the next sev-eral days.
Winds pushed the fumes 
into Gainesville from an 11,700-acre brush fire in Pin-hook Swamp, which is locat-ed just south of the Florida-Georgia line in Columbia 
County . Winds are expected 
to blow east Monday, mak-ing Jacksonville the smoke’s main target, said Kurt Wis-ner, a wildlife mitigation specialist with the Florida Forest Service.
Florida Highway Patrol 
is advising drivers to turn 
on their headlights and re-
duce speed when traveling on I-75, Interstate 10 and U.S. 90. According to a news release, visibility could be 
reduced during the next sev-
eral days.
Ludie Bond, also with the 
Florida Forest Service, said a team from the USDA Forest Service is managing the fire because it happened on fed-erally owned land.
The scope of the fire al-
most tripled this weekend, growing 3,000 acres on Sat-urday and another 4,000 on Sunday, Wisner said. Mem-bers of the forest service 
believe the fire started after 
lightning struck the swamp early last week, and fire-fighters first responded to the scene Thursday night.
The swamp was suscep-
tible to fire because it is in a dry area that had not burned in a long time, Wisner said.

Three women walked on stage 
wearing polka-dotted dresses and red 
flowers in their hair.
When the Spanish music began, 
they stamped their feet and clapped 
their hands, dancing a traditional Fla-
menco.
This dance was one tradition por -
trayed at Saturday’s Viva Europe! fes-tival at Bo Diddley Community Plaza in downtown Gainesville. About 700 visitors tasted authentic food, listened to traditional music and touched the craftwork of about 20 European coun-
tries.
The crowd cheered after Mayor 
Craig Lowe officially named April 7 
Gainesville’s Viva Europe Day.Engin Ege, the 23-year-old vice 
president of UF’s Turkish Student As-sociation, spoke with visitors as they examined the glass evil eyes, flower-patterned wooden spoons and thick, rough rugs with pockets at Turkey’s table.
Some stopped to try a piece of gold-
en-colored baklava.
“If you like our baklava, you’ll love 
our country,” Ege said to one passerby.
Ege’s parents are originally from 
Turkey , and she visits relatives there every summer.
Turkey is not a violent country , she 
said. There’s no religious war.
“I want to change people’s percep-
tions because they’re negative,” she said. “But we rise above it.”
Gale Keeler, an outreach coordina-
tor for UF’s Center of European Stud-ies, said the organization planned the festival to teach the community about other cultures.
“We wanted something fun and ed-
ucational to reach the general public,” she said. “I want people to know the di-versity of cultures in Gainesville. Taste their food, learn and have fun.”
Keeler said the festival took a year 
to plan.
“I’m really happy with the turnout, 
and it seems like everyone is having a great time,” she said.Festival shares European cultures, traditions

� SIXTEEN STUDENT GROUPS         
APPLIED FOR THE CHALLENGE.

Students pitched sustainable businesses 
Friday at the first Eco-Innovation Challenge 
during a UF Earth Day celebration.
The contest was open to any UF student 
who had an idea for a benefit corporation, which upholds social and environmental sustainability. Sixteen groups applied, and six were chosen as finalists.
Finance senior Meng Liu, 22, and po-
litical science senior Michele Ramirez, 22, worked together to design and pitch the winning idea. They pitched SignUp as a nonprofit that would connect American students studying in China with volunteer opportunities at disadvantaged migrant schools in Beijing.
SignUp will receive $500 and work 
with GatorNest, a UF program that sup-ports startup companies and gives students hands-on experience in solving problems companies face.
The pair lost points because their idea is 
a nonprofit.
The six finalist groups met in Hough 
Hall to deliver their pitches to a panel of three judges. Bill Rossi, a UF entrepreneur -
ship professor; Matt Hintze, founder of TutoringZone; and Chad Paris, founder of Parisleaf Printing and Design asked the students questions about their five-minute presentations.
Shay Barnes and Rebekah Foster came 
up with Full Circle, the second-place idea, which would give certificates and advertis-ing on the Full Circle website as incentives for restaurants to donate leftovers to the 
hungry.
Alex Hilbert’s idea, Urban Tree, placed 
third and won $100. Urban Tree would be 
an elaborate vending machine, eventually powered by solar panels, stocked with lo-cal fresh produce and placed in areas where people need easier access to fresh food.
The other three finalists had ideas for 
a sustainable food cart, a bicycle-powered 
generator and a guide that would help 
recycling facilities restructure to increase profits.
Professor and Director of Sustainability 
Studies Leslie Thiele came up with the idea for the Eco-Innovation Challenge as part of his program, Greening Gator Footprints, which mentors student leadership teams that work to promote conservation on cam-
pus. One of the teams was created to plan 
and host the event.
“I was really impressed by the caliber 
of the pitches,” said Kerry Stern, 20, an economics junior and member of the Eco-Innovation leadership team.
TutoringZone’s Hintze was impressed, 
too.
“I didn’t expect so many really outstand-
ing ideas,” he said. “The scope makes me say, ‘What the hell was I doing at age 21?’”Students pitch sustainable businesses at Earth Day celebration

When Max Lee hits the water, he glides 
across with ease. 
But when it’s time to leave, he has to 
swim over to an automatic lift to get out 
of the pool.
Lee, 42, who is paralyzed from his chest 
down, frequents Gainesville’s pools. 
All public and hotel pools will soon be 
required to have special lifts and ramps to accommodate Lee and others with dis-abilities.
In 2010, the Americans with Disabilities 
Act issued a set of standards that includes a rule that all public and commercial pools have to incorporate two entries for people with disabilities.
The 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible 
Design originally set a March 15 deadline for pool management to install lifts and ramps. 
In March, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder extended the deadline to May 21.
The Department of Justice is now con-
sidering another extension that could push the date for compliance to September, ac-cording to the ADA website.
Swimtownpools.com, a retailer that ad-
vertises its pool lifts as compliant with the ADA, has permanent pool lifts that range in price from about $2,900 to about $6,600.
The city of Gainesville installed a lift 
at Dwight H. Hunter Municipal Pool as its second handicapped-accessible entry about a year ago, well before the initial deadline, said Megan Risler, 21, the pool’s 
manager.  The beach entry and the pool lift pro-
vide a way for people with disabilities to 
enjoy the pool and do exercises they can’t do on land, she said.
Pool exercise increases their quality of 
life and sense of independence, said Amy Leaverton, 26, a physical therapy student at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences and an intern at the center.
Lee agreed and said a pool without a lift 
or ramp makes it harder for him to get the exercise he needs. He said it limits what he is able to do.
“If it’s not accessible, it just makes the 
world a lot smaller,” he said.Public pools will soon be required to be handicap-accessible

They were just looking for a 
late-night snack. But when three 
Gainesville women were denied ser -
vice for acting too rowdy , Gainesville Police said, they chucked beer cans 
at Checker’s employees.
Jaray L. Long, 19; Lakendra C. 
Williams, 24; and Shonta D. Wil-liams, 19; were arrested on charges 
of battery at about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. 
Two of the three women threw 
a pair of open Natural Light cans through the drive-thru window, lo-cated at 912 W University Ave., ac-cording to police.
While they were at the window, 
the women yelled at order taker Quinton L. Johnson. Johnson asked for help from his manager, Kelly S. Flake, and Flake 
told the women to leave. The women became angrier. Long sat in the driver’s seat, the Williamses in the back. After hear -
ing they weren’t getting their food, 
Long and Lakendra Williams un-loaded their 16 oz. beer cans, accord-ing to police.
The damage was minimal — just 
a little beer spilled on Flake and Johnson.  
After the women were arrested, 
Long denied throwing a can. She told officers she heard the Williamses ar -
guing with Flake and Johnson before one of them tossed a can out the win-dow. Long said she did not know which woman was the culprit.
Lakendra Williams also denied 
throwing beer. She said a fourth woman — whom none of the other three knew — was riding with them and got upset. Lakendra told offi-cers that, after throwing the can into the window, the mysterious fourth 
woman ran away.

His fiancee, 28-year-old Alisha Bass, said about six people 
had to jump to safety.
“It was on fire. The whole building. The stairs was gone. 
There was no stairs, so they had to jump,” said Bass, who was 
not at home during the fire.
By Sunday, some residents were planning to move back 
into new apartments at Majestic Oaks. The American Red Cross gave the displaced residents a one-night motel voucher and some money to buy new furniture, Bass said.
Bass said she received a card with $180 to replace furniture 
for her family. She has two children and one on the way.State and county fire inspectors will determine whether the 
fire was arson.
Even after firefighters doused the building with torrents of 
water, lingering flames licked the edge of the roof Saturday af-
ternoon.
By the time the fire was out, the roof was charred and some 
walls on the third floor were gone.

Thousands of students know An-
thony Bouton’s voice.
They’ve heard him call a profes-
sor old and fat and listened to him 
interrupt lectures almost daily.
But they don’t know who he is. 
To many , he’s known by one name: The Director.
He has filmed professor Mark 
Rush’s microeconomics class for two decades. It’s a prerequisite for dozens of majors and minors. 
When Rush calls, “Oh, Director,” 
students know to expect back-and-
forth insults and jokes, even though 
no one actually sees him.
He works in a small room carved 
out of the Bryan 130 lecture hall be-hind a camera and a closed door.
“I think of myself more as an 
offensive lineman,” Bouton said. “Hopefully you don’t notice me un-less I make a mistake.”
Though he’s behind the scenes, 
he’s been a UF staple for years. 
He started his master’s degree in 
Educational Media and Instruction-al Design in 1985. He stayed at UF after that to film engineering classes, and he switched to UF’s business school — and Rush’s lectures — in Fall 1990.
When Bouton was younger, peo-
ple mistook him for a student. Now, though, he looks like any other par -
ent or visiting alumnus with his polo shirt, khaki shorts and thinning gray hair. When he’s with Rush, students sometimes figure out who he is. But that’s not the only way he’s been recognized. 
Once, when he was going 
through a drive-thru line at a local Taco Bell, the voice on the other end of the speaker gasped after Bouton placed his order and said, “Are you The Director?”
When Bouton pulled up to 
the window, the student workers peeked out to see what he looked 
like. 
It was a rare break from his usual anonymity.
One of his daughters, a UF stu-
dent, enjoys her dad’s secret iden-
tity.
Elizabeth Bouton, a 20-year-old 
anthropology sophomore, thinks her dad’s laugh could give him away . 
But when she and Bouton grab 
Burrito Brothers for lunch, they’re never recognized.
She didn’t even exactly know 
what Bouton did until she men-
tioned to a friend in microeconomics 
that her dad filmed the class. 
Now she’s “The Director’s 
daughter.”
They have a good relationship, 
she said. 
He records her favorite comedies, 
so when she visits home they watch “Parks and Recreation” and “The Office” together. If she’s lucky , he’ll make her favorite spaghetti sauce.
When her friends find out who 
he is, though, they’re interested in The Director.
Her resident assistant from Mur -
phree Hall last year asked to meet Bouton, forgetting that they’d actu-ally met when he was just another parent. Most people react similarly.
She helps her dad keep his secret, 
but she’ll answer questions about him.
No, Bouton isn’t obese, although 
Rush insists during lectures that he 
is. He’s “dad-sized.” 
Yes, he and Rush really are 
friends. The families barbequed 
and attended soccer games together when their kids were younger.
The two men trade jokes off-
screen as much as they do during lectures. 
Bouton said not to address Rush 
as “doctor” — “he’s a teacher, not a soft drink” — and Rush joked he prefers not to say that he and Bouton work together.
During the lectures, though, 
Bouton lets Rush initiate the attacks, then comes back with a joke himself, 
so he isn’t stepping on the lecture 
too much.
But he’s not above pointing out 
Rush’s spelling errors, such as when 
he wrote “maintance” on the chalk-
board. Bouton started that class by showing old clips of Rush.
They have been working togeth-er for about 20 years, but Bouton could not be Rush’s regular director this spring because the rooms didn’t match up right. They’ll be paired up again this summer.
Bouton’s home base is a small of-
fice filled with a few shelves, a desk, his bicycle and a wall of television screens and control panels.
Behind the chair is a row of 
labeled VHS tapes waiting to be digitally converted. Bouton said he 
always makes a backup and often 
makes two.
Most students rely on the videos 
Bouton films, and they watch lec-
tures on their computers. Students 
can attend in person, but only 20 or so actually do.
Brian Jones, a 21-year-old indus-
trial and systems engineering junior, is one of them. He said he thinks if he didn’t go to the 8:30 a.m. class in person, he’d procrastinate watch-
ing the online videos and never get 
to them. It’s also a funny start to his day.
Jones said the professor also calls 
the woman filming this semester “The Director,” so Jones didn’t re-alize she isn’t Rush’s usual partner until about halfway through the se-mester.
He likes the current director and 
looks forward to her knock-knock jokes with Rush, but he said Bouton as The Director is a UF staple that students look forward to.
In the meantime, though, Bouton 
still films nine classes each week. He still rides his bike to campus, and he’s still relatively unrecognized.
His daughter still visits him in his 
office, but she doesn’t plan to take microeconomics. It’s not a require-
ment for her major, and she bonds 
with her dad over other things.
People might not realize Eliza-
beth Bouton is The Director’s daugh-ter.
She does hear, though, that she 
looks a lot like him.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
GEORGETOWN, Texas — Tim Tebow 
drew a crowd of about 15,000 to an out-
door Easter church service Sunday, telling the gathering it’s important to be outspo-ken about faith while admonishing athletes about not being better role models.
“In Christianity, it’s the Pope and Tebow 
right now,” Celebration Church pastor Joe Champion he said. “We didn’t have enough room to handle the Pope.”
Tebow — devout Christian, backup NFL 
quarterback and cultural phenomenon — has a flock of admirers drawn as much to his religious leanings as his Heisman Trophy skills.
Tebow told them he welcomed the at-
tention on his convictions as well as the “Tebowing” prayer pose he often strikes on the field because it puts his faith and prayer in the public conversation.
“It’s being talked about,” he said. “That’s exciting.”
Some at the “Easter on the Hill” morn-
ing service under sunny skies about 20 miles north of Austin drove more 100 miles to hear Tebow speak. The service took on the feel of a rock concert with more than a 100 school buses shuttling people to the sprawling mega-church campus from local shopping centers and the nearby college.
The service was peppered with lively 
Christian rock songs and Tebow took the large stage to cheers from those who could see him while others toward the back watched on massive video screens. He sat for a 20-minute interview with Champion to talk about his faith and its role in his public life.
“It’s OK to be outspoken about your 
faith,” Tebow said.
He also took a shot at professional ath-
letes who insist they are not role models.
“Yes you are. You’re just not a good one,” 
Tebow said.Champion asked Tebow what he thought 
needed to change culturally in America.
“First and foremost is what this country 
was based on: one nation under God. The more that we can get back to that,” Tebow said to applause.
Although church officials had said they 
typically get their biggest crowds on Eas-
ter, Tebow was clearly the big draw Sunday. Several hundred started head-ing toward the exits after Tebow spoke, not waiting for Champion’s main Sun-
day sermon so they could avoid the 80-degree heat and beat the traffic.
Some couldn’t wait for the official 8 a.m. 
opening to the church grounds and showed up hours early.
Debbie Sandoval, her husband and two 
sons arrived before sunrise. They wore Tebow’s Jets jerseys and set up camp close the large soundstage with a row of chairs.
“I love that boy. ... He’s like my third 
son,” said Sandoval, who is not a regular 
member of the church but wasn’t going to 
miss a chance to hear Tebow speak. A self-described “lifelong Broncos fan,” Sandoval said she became a Jets fan because of Tebow. The quarterback led the Broncos to the play-offs last season and was acquired by the Jets in a trade March 21.
“Everything about this young man’s ex-
traordinary life is special,” Sandoval said.
Amanda O’Hara drove about 100 miles 
from San Antonio on Saturday and got to the church about 4:30 a.m. “to be one of the first ones here.”
“I only got about four hours sleep, I was 
so excited,” O’Hara said. “He doesn’t hide who he is. Parents should see him as a role model.”
The crowd included people dressed in 
Easter bunny costumes and one person dressed as the Sesame Street character Elmo. 
About an hour before the service, Elmo 
dropped to a knee with a toddler boy to mimic Tebow’s prayer pose.

The Director?
135 TOTAL VOTES32% YES
69% NOFriday’s question: Are you going home for Easter or Passover?
To buckle or not?
Seat belts should be 
your decision
To celebrate Easter weekend, police in West Palm Beach 
dressed up as Easter bunnies. 
No, they weren’t volunteering their time to go to 
hospitals or churches, surprising children with Easter baskets 
and chocolate eggs. These cops were standing on the side of the 
road, using their bunny costumes as a disguise to catch unsus-
pecting motorists whose seat belts were unfastened.
Click it or ticket! Happy Easter!
The absurdity and downright trickery of these police officers 
calls into question the entire idea behind mandatory seat belt laws.
Does the government have the right to tell adults they must 
wear their seat belts or else? In other words, does the government have the right to protect people from harming themselves?
Not wearing a seat belt is incredibly stupid, and it would be 
irresponsible of us to recommend not buckling up each time you drive. 
However, if you want to be irresponsible, it should not be 
any of our business, and it certainly should not be the business of the government.
A Harris Interactive poll showed that 86 percent of the public 
supports seat belt laws. And on some level, it might make sense. Don’t we want to keep people safe?
But do mandatory seat belt laws keep us safe? The evidence 
is murky, to say the least.
Police in 32 states and the District of Columbia can stop ve-
hicles to check for seat belt violations. In 17 other states, police can cite occupants of motor vehicles for failing to wear their seat belts if they have pulled the car over for another reason, such as speeding.
The only state without mandatory seat belt laws is New 
Hampshire.
Most seat belt laws were passed in the 1980s and 1990s, and 
many were passed in the 2000s. One would expect motor vehi-cle-related death rates to be declining from year to year.
However, according to the CDC, from 1999 to 2006, motor-
vehicle related fatalities remained steady at about 15 percent. It was only in 2007 that fatalities began to decline, reaching 14.45 percent and falling to 11.68 percent in 2009.
It is important that we do not draw conclusions on causation 
from correlation, but could this decline be due to seat belt laws?
A June 2010 report from the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration showed that there has been a steady downward trend in motor vehicle crash fatalities since 1972. This downward trend started to occur before most states passed any mandatory seat belt laws.
Fewer fatalities make sense, given that vehicles have been 
built more efficiently and with more safety features year after year. But to say that seat belt laws have contributed to fewer fa-talities seems to be a bit of a stretch.
Regardless of the evidence, we should have the freedom to 
choose whether we want to wear seat belts. Children are, of course, another story, but for adults the question of whether to buckle or not to buckle should be left to each person to decide.Fidelity and monogomy are not the same
We have a problem at this university: boys in rela-
tionships who secretly sleep around.
Many of the boys of old Florida have taken to 
making mistresses of its girls. While the girls are no doubt the fairest, such behavior leads me to wonder what part of 
the boys is the squarest — for it is not the content of their 
character (or, I hope, their shorts).
This problem is by no means limited to our campus. 
Even the great and wonderful enchantress Ke$ha once sang-talked to one such man, “I never thought that you 
would be the one acting like a slut while I was gone.”
Neither did we, Ke$ha. Neither did we.Quite a few of my lady friends have told me of their 
sexploits with taken men, and most of them knew of the 
men’s in-relationship status.
Each time, the men made the approach, soliciting these 
ladies for sexy time — and did so while they were sober, 
mind you. The ladies obliged, and — more often than not 
— the men came back for more. The worst thing: The men 
asked the girls to keep quiet about it.
This bothers me, and not because I’m someone who 
can’t imagine people violating stringent rules on human sexual behavior. People always resist rules on hanky-pan-
ky. Don’t believe me? Ask the pre-2000 Texas gay commu -
nity or the Catholic Church.
What gets to me is that the men’s behavior stems from 
unexamined monogamy. Having sex with someone other than your current partner isn’t always cheating. So many 
people put themselves in a quandary to cheat or not to cheat, but really, that isn’t the question.
Instead, these men should ask themselves why they’re 
accepting that monogamy and fidelity are the same thing. In our sexually enlightened age, why not define the rules for yourself?
And that goes for everyone.Ladies, why do you care if your boyfriend has sex with 
other girls? And dudes, why do you care if your girlfriend sleeps with other guys? Preventing each other from get-ting your rocks off isn’t strengthening your relationship or making it any more honest. All 
it’s doing is building resentment 
and introducing deceit.
Monogamy is a definition of 
a certain type of sexual behav-ior; fidelity is about being faith-
ful and true to your partner. The 
latter can easily exist without the former, and trying to link 
them drives a wedge between 
couples.
If a horny boyfriend flirts with a girl and has sex with 
her, he isn’t necessarily demonstrating love, intimacy or 
passion for her. If love, intimacy and passion remain be-
tween a couple, no amount of outside sex can make a rela-
tionship any less open and honest.
This is not to say that all relationships need be open and 
all partners should boink anyone they want while dating.
But couples need to have the discussion about whether 
or not they are OK with dropping monogamy. They need 
to recognize what monogamy is, and they need to know 
that fidelity isn’t the same thing. If one or the other isn’t cool with it, that’s fine — but the reasons matter.
If it’s out of jealousy or discomfort with the idea, those 
are some pretty big fish to fry because both reasons arise 
from greater trust issues. Do not let fear become the reason 
for your exclusivity.
Couples should define their relationships for them-
selves, laying out their own ground rules. For instance, I do not care that Taco Bell sells its delicious goods to other 
customers, for I know that it doesn’t affect the love and intimacy we have. And if selling its goods to others both-
ered me, that doesn’t mean it should only serve me or that others should stop eating at Taco Bell.
Form your relationship at its most honest state, and it 
will be one worth having; otherwise you can almost count 
on getting hurt.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, APRIL 9, 2012  ALLIGATOR, 7
  I have great news for everyone who is graduating and can’t ﬁ  nd 
a job. North Dakota is on a hiring spree and needs people fast. Even the McDonald’s there is paying $15 an hour, and it can’t 
ﬁ  nd enough people for the jobs.
  There aren’t enough houses and infrastructure is mostly ab-
sent, but the state is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in surplus that can be used to meet the demands from the thou-sands of workers coming into the state.
  Why is this state doing so well when the rest of the country is 
reeling? The story of this growth could well cost President Obama his re-election.
  Of the 15 counties with the nation’s lowest unemployment 
rates, 11 are located in North Dakota. Billions of gallons of oil have been discovered in this state that were previously unreach-
able but are now accessible due to the constant creative destruc-
tion that is capitalism.
  Natural gas ﬁ  elds are also located there, and the state just 
surpassed California as the third highest producer of energy in the country. If you’ve been to the Kangaroo lately, you know that having cheaper fuel for your car is one of the top issues hitting your budget right now.
  It is true that if we released all the oil in our strategic reserves 
right now, it wouldn’t impact the world price that much. 
However, a comprehensive energy strategy has to allow for 
oil to be our primary fuel for the next several decades, and gov-ernment policies that put tight regulations on oil companies and discourage drilling send messages to speculators who push pric-es ever higher.
  Even the most progressive among us would ﬁ  nd it almost im-
possible to live life in the absence of fossil fuels. 
The key is to make them burn cleaner and to engineer practical 
solutions with what we know works while we look for alterna-
tives.
  As the economy tepidly improves 
(and we’ve even seen that cool off re-
cently), gasoline prices will climb ever higher, further beneﬁ  ting all of those autocratic regimes in the Middle East that don’t like us. 
The truth is that we have more en-
ergy in the U.S. in the form of coal and 
natural gas than Saudi Arabia. 
If we worked to convert vehicles 
to natural gas and found an efﬁ  cient 
distribution channel, we might be able to get vehicles to burn 
cleaner.
  It is already the case that natural gas burns cleaner than coal. Unfortunately, instead of trying to make this technology 
cleaner, we do things like artiﬁ  cially support the price of corn to produce biofuels so cities such as Gainesville can force residents 
to pay through the nose for a trendy new energy plant that could 
be made obsolete in a few years.
  The president is weak on energy as an issue. He opposed the 
Keystone pipeline — a fact that Republicans will be sure to repeat every other sentence as fuel prices climb.
  Obama’s policies of subsidy and government guarantees go to 
ﬁ  rms that have yet to show a high-level beneﬁ  t to society from a scalable technology. 
I’m all for investment in companies, but I think it can be best 
done by venture capitalists that have some fear of losing money.
  As North Dakota deals with giant surpluses and can’t build 
enough houses for all its new residents, the administration will have to defend why it wants to move America away from domes-tic energy production, which could be a huge shot in the arm to a country still recovering economically.
  Driving trucks to move oil, working on a rig in northwestern 
North Dakota or ﬂ  ipping burgers for the rig workers at McDon-ald’s aren’t cool, ﬂ  ashy, green jobs, but they take a step to solv-
ing a very real problem of incredibly high fuel prices and high 
unemployment.
  These jobs also pay much higher than the median U.S. wage. If Romney is smart, he will drill Obama on the inconvenient 
truth of the economic success story in North Dakota.
  If the president doesn’t start supporting domestic energy pro-
duction and the creation of countless middle-class jobs, he might lose his bid for re-election come November.

opinions@alligator.orgDuring the past several weeks, there has been 
an unavoidable buzz persisting through-out news and social media outlets concern-
ing the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was killed in February by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. 
Although it took a few weeks for word of this inci-
dent to spread beyond Florida, the persistence of local 
organizations and businesses, particularly radio sta-tions, succeeded in getting the word out.
Rallies demanding justice for the slain teen have 
subsequently sprung up across the United States as 
outraged citizens learned of the local police depart-
ment’s seemingly sluggish response to Trayvon’s death.
The incident has rightly thrust a spotlight on 
Florida’s particularly lenient Stand Your Ground 
law, which protects the use of force as self-defense 
when there is reasonable belief of a threat, even if the one claiming self-defense was not the ﬁ  rst to retreat.
Trayvon’s death has reminded millions of par-
ents across the country of the devastation that los-ing a child entails. This tragic event immediately presented itself as an opportunity for us to rally to-gether as a nation and demand justice for each and 
every citizen, no matter his or her ethnicity, sexual 
orientation or religious preference.
So, when President Barack Obama offered his re-
action to the incident on March 23, the nation was 
watching its leader intently.
Obama’s remarks were sympathetic and inspir-
ing as he called for a thorough investigation, while 
also reﬂ  ecting on the tragedy that this sort of loss represents for parents. But as the president wrapped 
up his thoughts on the matter, he noted, “You know, 
if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon.”
Upon hearing this statement, skepticism over 
the accuracy and implications of Obama’s response 
entered my mind. Although it might not have been 
what he intended, Obama came across as implying that because he is the same race as Trayvon Martin, 
he is particularly able to sympathize with the ca-
lamity that the Martin family has endured.
In light of Trayvon’s shooting, it is important to 
acknowledge that race relations in the United States are far from ideal. While we have moved many steps forward, racism still lives on in our nation. It is highly likely that racism played a 
part in the murder of Tray-
von — an inhumane act that has no place in our society 
and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law. But I believe it was unwise of Obama to high-
light his shared race with Trayvon.
Would Obama feel less sympathetic if the mur-
dered teenager had been of a different race than his own? Probably not, but Obama’s comments can be 
easily construed as implying that very point.
Because racism still exists in our nation, as this 
tragedy exempliﬁ  es, it would have been wise of 
Obama to move past the discussion on race and 
instead highlight the unacceptable nature of the 
crime, regardless of the color of the victim or the shooter.
But by mentioning the outward appearance of 
Trayvon, Obama took the debate in an unintended direction — one that has proven to be divisive.
To that end, I hope that Obama will shift the 
course of this discussion away from the issue of race. 
This tragic incident should place scrutiny on the 
Florida law that has let this situation get so out of 
control. Therefore, it would be constructive for the 
president to make a conscious effort to refocus the debate in light of his highly publicized comments. 
In fact, Obama’s senior adviser, David Plouffe, 
was presented with such an opportunity when he was recently asked to respond to Newt Gingrich’s remarks that Obama’s statement was “disgraceful [because] it’s not a question of who that young man looked like.” Plouffe replied to this question by stat-
ing that Gingrich’s comments were reprehensible, 
but he failed to offer a true explanation of why. I am left to wonder why it matters that Obama’s son would have “looked a lot like” Trayvon.
We all ought to be outraged by the tragedy of 
Trayvon’s death because it is the ultimate loss for one’s family and community. But we should feel 
this way regardless of what our potential sons 
might look like.

Seconds remained on the 
clock. The score was tied. Jimmy 
Gunderson left his goal and went 
on the attack.
The 30-year-old Tallahassee 
resident got the ball and smashed 
it from behind midfield. The shot 
careened through his opposition 
and rolled into the goal.
A triumphant Gunderson 
jumped off his bike and threw up his arms.
His team, Denim Venom, de-
feated its opponent at the first Canadian Tuxedo Invitational, a hardcourt bike polo tournament 
hosted Sunday at Veterans Park 
by the Gainesville Hardcourt 
Bike Polo club.
Hardcourt Bike Polo is a vari-
ation of traditional bicycle polo, which was invented in Ireland in 1891, according to the League of Bike Polo website. There are 
three players on each team in the 
hardcourt version of the game, and Florida matches are usually 10 minutes per game.
Hardcourt Bike Polo has ex-
panded quickly since its creation in the early 21st century.
This year, the sport’s fourth-
annual world championship will be hosted in London. Twenty-two 
teams competed in 2011 in the All 
Florida Bike Polo Championship 4.“Right now, there’s a tourna-
ment about every two weeks in 
Florida,” said Danny Wood, 34, 
a Southeast League of Bike Polo regional representative.
Websites dedicated to the 
sport are helping Hardcourt Bi-cycle Polo grow by connecting members of its community across the globe. 
LeagueofBikePolo.com pro-
vides players with forums, tour -
nament dates and club listings. 
For a player like Justin Pogge, 
the bicycle can be a mixture of in-novation and victory spoils.The 31-year-old Tallahassee 
resident welded the steel frame of his bike, modified the gear-shift-ing system so he could control 
both brakes with one hand, and 
put on 48-spoke wheels to keep his bike from being damaged. 
He won his bike’s hot-pink handlebars, pedals and wheel covers from various tournaments in the Southeast.
He said the bike cost him less 
than $150. 
His polo mallet is made of a 
ski pole and a recycled plastic pipe.
Players can compare bicycles 
and other equipment, which some players say fit well with the sport’s do-it-yourself mentality.
“Whatever you come up with 
in your garage thinking, ‘This may work in a polo game,’ could be the next big thing everyone’s doing,” said Alix Nelson, a 28-year-old physical therapist and 
bike polo player from Orlando.
Travis Mitchell, a Gainesville 
Hardcourt Bike Polo Club mem-
ber said bike polo is the easiest 
and cheapest bike sport to get in-
volved with.
Mitchell used to play with his 
commuting bicycle. 
His third bike, which he pur -
chased in fall of 2011, only cost him $60.
Mitchell said he expects the 
bike polo club to grow as the 
sport gains popularity, especially 
in urban areas where many peo-ple own bicycles.
“It’s not going to stay small,” 
Gunderson said. “We just need to 
guide it and make sure it doesn’t 
turn into anything we don’t want it to.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 9, 2012

Florida’s quarterback competition
Who is your leader for the Gators’ starting 
quarterback job after Saturday’s spring game? Vote online at alligatorSports.org. MATT WATTS
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Jeff Driskel took the first snap 
when spring practice began last 
month; Jacoby Brissett took the first snap in Saturday’s spring game.
What does it mean? Nothing, 
apparently. At least not yet.
As Florida wraps up its second 
spring practice season under coach Will Muschamp, the competition at quarterback remains murky at best. Muschamp said Monday that the battle will continue through the summer and into fall regardless of the two sophomores’ individual 
performances in Saturday’s Or -
ange & Blue Debut.
Neither Brissett nor Driskel did 
much to distance himself from 
the other Saturday, but that’s also a good thing. Both quarterbacks were sharp in leading lengthy scoring drives, finding open re-ceivers and not forcing the ball into coverage. Driskel finished 12 of 14 for 147 yards with a rushing touch-down, while Brissett completed 9 
of 16 passes for 233 yards and two 
touchdowns.
“I think today you saw both 
those guys take command of our football team. Both guys made ver -
tical plays down the field, good de-cisions where they took the ball,” Muschamp said. “You saw what I’ve been seeing from 14 practices 
previous to today. I’ve said before, 
we can win with both guys.”
After a slow start in which both 
quarterbacks failed to convert their first opportunities under center into points, Brissett made the first 
highlight play when he found 
Latroy Pittman 
in single cover -
age for a 43-yard 
gain down the left sideline. It was a perfectly thrown ball that hit the freshman 
receiver in stride and the type of play that Florida’s offense lacked a 
season ago.
Coaches and players alike have 
raved about Pittman, an early en-
rollee who has made waves in his first spring in Gainesville and finished with two catches for 51 yards.
“He’s been showing us he can 
make plays,” Brissett said. “Only 
thing we can do is just throw the 
ball up and give him a chance.”
Asked what he brings to the 
offense that Driskel does not, Bris-sett showed that the competition between the two remains light-hearted.
“I don’t know. I guess I’m slow-
er, so, that’s what I’m lacking,” he 
said. “Jeff is a great quarterback. 
He can make every throw that I can make, so it’s going to be tough to

When Ashanée Dickerson 
stepped on the mat Saturday 
at the NCAA Southeast Re-
gional, memories of the 2011 
postseason flew through her head.
Last year, she stumbled at 
regionals, falling on balance beam (8.475) and posting a career-worst all-around total of 38.
As much as Dickerson 
tried to focus on the present and not think of the Gators’ struggles at the end of last season, the past eventually 
served as fuel for her Satur -
day afternoon.  
“Yes, it did motivate us 
a lot,” the junior all-around 
competitor said. “We just 
went out there and did our 
job.”
Dickerson scored a sea-
son-best 39.65 to claim the 
all-around title, as No. 1 seed 
Florida recorded a 197.325 to win its seventh regional championship in eight years in the Reynolds Coliseum in 
Raleigh, N.C.
The regional all-around 
victory was the second of her 
career. In 2010, she notched a 
39.70 for the individual title 
at the NCAA Salt Lake City Regional.
“Ashanée was just lights 
out,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“She went out and com-
peted very aggressively. I 
had no doubt that she was 
going to do a great job.” 
Dickerson tallied a 9.95 on 
vault and a 9.9 on her other three events after sticking all 
of her landings. 
She shared the vault title 
with UF sophomore Alaina 
Johnson and tied for the un-
even bars win with North 
Carolina State’s Rachel Fin-cham. She also placed second on beam and floor exercise.
“For an athlete to do that, 
it’s extremely incredible on all four events,” Faehn said. “It’s something, as a coach, that 
you cannot 
expect an 
athlete to do 
that every single com-petition.
“ O n 
vault, she just stuck 
it. It was huge and she didn’t 
move at all on the landing. 
She did the best vault she’s done all year. It was a very well deserved score.” 
In addition to Florida’s 
fate last postseason, Dicker -
son found extra motivation in other areas Saturday.
For the first time this year, 
both of Dickerson’s parents showed up to watch her Gators clinch trip to 
NCAA Championships
� THE GATORS USED PRE-SNAP MO -
TION ON ROUGHLY 60 PERCENT OF 
SNAPS IN SATURDAY’S ORANGE & BLUE DEBUT.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
 
As UF’s offense cycled through its pre-
snap motions, fullback Hunter Joyer could 
hear the effect it was having on the de-fense.
With new offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease calling the shots for the first time, the Gators shifted formations before the snap 
on about 60 percent of their plays. That put 
the defense into scramble mode, forcing it to adjust to a look it wasn’t expecting.
“You can tell it confuses them,” Joyer 
said. “I can hear them just from the other 
side of the ball trying to switch and get 
lined up right. If we can do it right and get it fast enough and quick enough, I think they won’t even be able to get lined up right and it will wear them down.”
As was common practice in Pease’s 
six years at Boise State, UF rotated backs, tight ends and receivers before the major -
ity of its snaps.
At times the shift was as simple as a 
tight end switching to the opposite end of the line, while in other cases as many as four players were moving at once. In one instance, Jacoby Brissett moved from tight end to quarterback to take the snap as Trey 
Burton left the shotgun formation to split 
out wide.
“It’s like a Jedi mind trick at first,” line-
backer Mike Taylor said. “You’ve got to be 
mentally prepared.”
The confusion wasn’t always confined 
to the defense. Multiple snaps were de-
layed as backs and receivers waved each Pease’s touch on offense to confuse SEC opponents, players saySee gym, p Age 16

Five innings, nine hits, eight 
runs, three hit batters and 95 
pitches. 
That sounds like a terrible 
day at the park for one starting pitcher. But in Florida’s weekend series loss to LSU, that’s the line 
left-hander Brian Johnson and 
right-hander Karsten Whitson combined to form in their respec-tive Thursday night and Saturday afternoon starts. 
Once the strength of the team, 
boasting a weekend rotation com-pletely intact from a year ago, the Gators’ pitching staff looked like 
it was in shambles against the Ti-
gers. 
“If we’re doing something well 
one game, we’re not doing some-thing well on the other side — ei-ther if it’s pitching, defense or hit-ting,” senior right fielder Preston 
Tucker said. “We can’t quite piece 
it all together.”
Pitching is generally the area 
to blame when a team scores 20 runs in a series, yet loses two 
out of three games. It can also be 
blamed when a team falls behind 6-2 in the fourth inning, as the Gators did Thursday night. Or 
when a team drops a game after 
leading 7-2, as the Gators did on Saturday. 
With usual No. 1 starter Hud-
son Randall out for the week-
end with what UF coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan called a “tired arm,” No. 1 Florida (25-7, 7-5 Southeast-ern Conference) went into make-
shift mode when putting together 
its weekend rotation against No. 12 LSU (25-7, 8-4 SEC).  
Johnson was moved up into 
the No. 1 spot, Whitson was given 
the No. 3 spot for his first week-
end appearance since Feb. 26 and sophomore Jonathon Craw-ford was slated to handle Friday night’s pitching matchup against 
former sixth-round Major League 
draft pick Kevin Gausman. 
“We’ve got to put some zeroes 
on the board,” O’Sullivan said af-ter Thursday night’s loss. 
Ironically, the zeros came from 
Florida’s starting pitcher with the least experience. Crawford, who threw just 3.2 innings as a freshman, out-dueled Gausman 
en route to a 7-0 win on Friday 
night. 
Then it was back to experience, 
and the regularly scheduled LSU slugfest. 
Whitson lasted just seven bat-
ters, hitting the leadoff man in the first and second innings before getting pulled in favor of Steven 
Rodriguez. The floodgates only 
opened further for Rodriguez, as he surrendered three runs in four innings. O’Sullivan was quick to answer when asked if Whitson’s 
early exit had anything to do with 
health.
After opening the season as 
the Gators’ No. 2 starter, Whitson 
missed more than a month with 
an arm injury. “He’s fine,” O’Sullivan said. Meanwhile, Florida is not 
“fine.” When rankings come out 
today, the Gators will not be the 
overwhelming No. 1 team for the first time this season. 
They have lost five of their 
past seven games, including con-
secutive series losses to SEC foes. 
Florida lost just two SEC series all of last season. It now trails Ken-tucky in the SEC East standings. 
The bright spot is that aside 
from an unusual five-run loss at North Florida, UF has lost four games by a combined six runs,  often in strange fashion. 
“It’s frustrating, but we gotta 
bounce back, simple as that,” O’Sullivan said. “We got a good team. We’ll be there in the end. 
We just gotta play a little bit bet-
ter.”
Pitching punishes Gators in second straight SEC series loss

The slow clap that signifies a match point 
started to grow into applause as Joanna 
Mather toed the baseline.
She tossed the ball perfectly and unloaded 
a serve. Her opponent, Olivia Howlett, was able to return it softly, setting Mather up for a punctuating approach shot that sealed the 
match.
Just like that, her final match at Linder Sta-
dium ended. It was the culmination of a stellar 
career in Gainesville for Florida’s lone senior.
As the No. 2 Gators (17-1, 10-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) clinched at least a share of the SEC championship, Mather’s coach and team-mates took time to recognize her after a great four years.
“Joanna really exemplifies everything we 
try to stand for as a tennis program. She has a first-class attitude every day in practice, whether she’s playing well or not,” coach Ro-land Thornqvist said. “She gets along with everyone, and she is classy . When you have a player where you can just tell the rest of the team, ‘Hey , look at what Joanna does,’ you 
don’t have to spend that much time trying to 
teach everybody else. They just kind of follow what the leader does.”
Mather, who also won her 100th career 
doubles match on Sunday, has never been a part of a team loss at Linder Stadium. The Gators have gone a remarkable 52-0 at home during her career, a mark she helped extend Sunday. After UF swept the doubles point, 
LSU provided little resistance as all six singles 
matches went Florida’s way.
Mather, who will graduate this spring with 
a degree in management, has yet to decide 
what her post-college plans are but said that 
her time at Florida has exceeded her expecta-tions. Her most memorable moments came during the team’s national championship last year and during a big win against then-No. 2 Georgia in 2009. 
“It’s a little sad. It’s scary, but it’s also excit-
ing too. It doesn’t feel like it’s been four years,” she said. “The national title was definitely a 
big memory. My freshman year when we beat 
the No. 2 team in the nation, Georgia, here. It 
was a huge upset and that was an amazing memory . 
“Just being out here with 
my teammates and work-ing hard, also great memo-ries. It’s been everything 
and more that I imagined it 
to be. I’m so thankful that I 
chose to come to Florida.”
One of Mather’s closest friends also hap-
pens to be her doubles partner. Junior Lauren 
Embree provided the other half of a team that 
defeated Howlett and Yvette Vlaar 8-2. 
Embree, who will assume next year the role 
of senior leader along with fellow juniors Allie Will and Caroline Hitimana, said that Mather was everything a team could want in a team-mate.
“She’s just an amazing person,” Embree 
said. “She always lifts up the spirit in the lock-
er room, she’s always in a good mood, and she 
always comes out here and gives 100 percent every day. She’s going to be a huge loss for us and we’re all going to miss her, but we’re real-
ly grateful to have her on our team this year.” 
Men lose to Tigers: The No. 9 Gators 
couldn’t overcome a slow start and broke a 
four-match winning streak, losing 4-2 to LSU. Florida (13-8, 6-4 SEC) hadn’t lost since March 
23rd, when they fell 4-3 to Mississippi State.
Sunday saw a comeback effort fall short, 
as the Gators fell into a 3-0 hole early. After 
losing the doubles point, both of Florida’s top 
two singles players lost their matches. While 
trying to fight back into the match, the Tigers clinched when Tom Knight defeated Billy Fe-derhofer in a decisive third set. 
Florida’s lone victors were Spencer New-
man, who won in straight sets, and Florent Diep, who won in three sets.Mather finishes career in familiar fashion with win over LSU

 A few of Florida’s early enroll-
ees from the team’s No. 3 overall 
recruiting class made big impacts in their first spring game Saturday.
Linebacker Antonio Morrison, 
who has garnered praise from the Gators’ coaching staff during spring practice, registered nine total tack-les, including one for a loss.
“Antonio Morrison showed up,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “Now that’s a tough ‘backer out of Chica-go. He likes playing the game.”
On the offensive side of the 
ball, wide receiver Latroy Pittman capped off his reportedly stellar spring with two receptions for 51 yards, including a 43-yard catch down the left sideline in the sec-ond quarter that helped set up the game’s first score.
Muschamp has spoken highly 
of Pittman through spring practice, 
and Saturday was no different. Mus-
champ said the 6-foot, 201-pound receiver has solid instincts in find-ing the ball and good play-making ability , something sophomore wide receiver Quinton Dunbar agrees with.
“The guy just makes plays,” 
Dunbar said. “He just makes 
plays. That’s all I can say. He’s very 
good.”
Mixed results in red zone: After 
scoring touchdowns on just 18 of 37 red-zone trips last season (48.65 per -
cent), Florida found the end zone 
five times in eight red-zone oppor -
tunities during Saturday’s Orange 
& Blue Debut.
While 62.5 percent is a stark im-
provement from last season’s num-ber, four scores came in the fourth quarter, when the offenses were scoring at will against walk-ons and depth chart cellar-dwellers.
The Gators struggled to find 
the end zone from within the 20-yard line for the first three quarters, which saw a combined four drives enter the red zone. 
Florida’s only red-zone touch-
down during the first three quarters came on a third-and-goal post pass from Jacoby Brissett to Quinton Dunbar from the 4-yard line.
When the fourth quarter came, 
though, both offenses were perfect inside the 20-yard line — including when sophomore fullback Hunter Joyer found paydirt from three yards out.
“I feel we’re gonna be a lot stron-
ger in the red zone this year,” Joyer said. “We’re gonna get it down.”
Injury report: Junior safety Matt 
Elam sat out Saturday’s scrimmage with a groin injury. 
Junior linebacker Jon Bostic also 
missed the spring game after expe-riencing back spasms during prac-tice Friday. Buck linebacker Ronald Powell started the game, but left 
early after sprain-ing his knee. 
Muschamp also 
said cornerback 
Cody Riggs got “banged up,” but expected him to be fine. 
Left tackle 
Xavier Nixon suf-
fered what appeared to be a minor 
shoulder injury late and was seen 
leaving the stadium with an ice pack on the shoulder.
Gators pick up commitments: 
Ahmad Fulwood, the No. 8 wide re-ceiver in the nation according to Ri-vals.com, gave his oral commitment to the Gators’ coaching staff while attending Saturday’s scrimmage.
Along with Fulwood, a 6-foot-4, 
197-pound receiver, Florida picked up pledges from three-star defen-sive back Tre Bell and three-star of-fensive lineman Joshua Outlaw.
The three bring UF’s 2013 re-
cruiting class to 14 members.

Sophomore quarterback Jeff Driskel, seen throwing Saturday, set 
a new spring-game record for completion percentage (85.7).
Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff
UF used motion on roughly 60 percent of plays Saturday.
Experience helping renewed offensive line
other into position, and quarterback 
Jeff Driskel recalled a scenario when he forgot to send someone in motion 
altogether.
It was still a solid day overall for 
Florida’s offense. 
After racking up only 5.7 yards 
per play during the first three quar -
ters, the offensive units exploded to 
combine for 12.8 yards per play in the fourth.
While most of the attention was on 
the quarterback battle between Bris-sett and Driskel, the offensive line closed a strong spring season on a high note.
“We’re just better up front,” coach 
Will Muschamp said. “We’re tough-er. We’re stronger. … I’m just really pleased with our progress on the of-fensive line. If there’s any one unit of our football team that I think has 
made tremendous strides and needed 
to, it’s been there. We’ve got to con-tinue to do so.”
Muschamp said the biggest key in 
the offensive line’s improvement is experience. The group returns four starters — left tackle Xavier Nixon, center Jonotthan Harrison, right guard Jon Halapio and right tackle 
Matt Patchan.
The only new face in the projected 
starting five is James Wilson, a sixth-year senior.
“That’s the biggest improvement 
we had from last season,” Brissett 
said. “I feel like it’s a unity at the line.”
Driskel said he felt the protection 
was great, citing plays where he had 
as many as five or six seconds to find 
a receiver.
Florida finished No. 105 nationally 
in total offense last season. But, with 
a new coordinator and an improved 
offensive line, there is a sense of con-fidence heading into the fall.
Taylor said SEC defenses won’t 
know what hit them.
“Oh, they’ll be screwed,” Taylor 
said. 
“They’re going to be so confused. 
Good luck.”

We’re tougher. We’re stronger. 
… I’m just really pleased with 
our progress on the offensive 
line.”
Will Muschamp
UF football coachMuschamp: Offseason imperative
see what the real difference 
is.”
On Driskel’s first series, 
he displayed that difference in speed with two designed 
run plays that gained 12 
yards. But if he’s going to beat out Brissett for the job, it will be with his arm, and that didn’t look too shabby, ei-ther. Driskel set a new spring game record for completion percentage (85.7) and looked considerably more comfort-
able in the pocket than he did 
when thrust into the lineup last season after John Brant-ley was injured.
“Last year, I was kind 
of a little clueless out there, just kind of locking onto one guy,” he said. 
“I feel like I’m going 
through my progressions more and just playing in-stead of thinking.”
Driskel referenced one 
play in particular, a crossing route to Andre Debose that went for a 44-yard gain, in which he had plenty of time to find the right read. 
Now that spring practice 
has concluded, Muschamp said it’s up to the quarter -
backs to create separation between themselves as the 
coaches are not allowed to 
be involved during offseason conditioning. Still, he expects Driskel and Brissett to or -
ganize and lead the team in player-run practices.
“(Offseason leadership) is 
a huge, huge indicator to see who takes a leg up and see who’s going to get our foot-ball out there and do team drills,” Muschamp said. 
“That’s what it has to be 
now. I can’t be out there. ... They’ve got to take control of our football team.”

“It was really special,” Dickerson said. 
“I just wanted to go out and compete for 
them. But I kind of just did what I do in 
practice every day and had fun with my teammates.” 
The Gators won at least a share of each 
event title at the regional. Johnson also tied Dickerson on uneven bars, while Marissa 
King (9.925) took home the win on beam 
and freshman Kytra Hunter (9.95) earned first place on floor. 
Florida learned after its meet Saturday 
that its competition on the first day of the 
NCAA Championships will be No. 4 Ala-
bama, No. 5 Georgia, No. 8 Arkansas, No. 9 Oregon State and No. 12 Ohio State. 
The three top-scoring teams on April 20 
will advance to the Super Six, which will be held the next day.
The Gators own a 6-1 record this season 
against the field.
“It’s back to business,” Dickerson said.

Bailey Castro was feeling 
generous in the third inning 
Sunday.
The freshman designated 
hitter sent two souvenirs over the left-field wall in the same frame, notching six of 
her school record-tying sev-
en RBI to cap a 10-run third for the Gators.
“I’m just seeing the ball really well,” Castro said. “I was having a good day. I just had a good eye for the ball 
and I took a couple of good 
swings.”
Florida’s 10-spot bur -
ied Ole Miss early in a 14-3 victory Sunday, capping a 
three-game sweep.
Defeating the Rebels (16-
21, 3-11 Southeastern Con-
ference) marked the Gators’ 
fourth series sweep in league 
play this season.Castro’s two home runs 
Sunday gave her three total long balls during a weekend 
in which the UF bats made a 
lot of noise.
Florida (35-4, 15-2 SEC) 
scored 28 runs against Ole Miss in three games, con-
tinuing its recent hot streak 
at the plate.
After scoring just three 
runs in back-to-back losses 
to USF and Georgia in late 
March, UF has averaged 9.4 runs per game in its last five contests, all wins.
“We’re very potent,” 
coach Tim Walton said. “We’re very disciplined at the plate. We don’t swing at a whole lot of bad pitches.”
Florida powered through 
the weekend with big in-nings, logging six frames with multiple runs scored.
Consecutive innings with 
two runs helped Florida top Ole Miss 5-0 on Friday, while a six-run first inning buried the Rebels early in the 
Gators’ 9-1 win Saturday.
However, the biggest of-
fensive outburst for UF was 
Sunday’s third frame.
After a leadoff walk by 
Cheyenne Coyle, Castro came to the plate looking to add to the early 3-0 lead.
Castro connected on the 
third pitch she saw from Ole Miss hurler Kendall Bruning, marking her second homer off the Rebels senior in three days.
Four runs and a pitching 
change later, Castro walked up to the plate for the second time that inning with the bases loaded.
Facing a 3-1 count, Castro 
put the game out of reach, depositing her first career grand slam over the left-field wall to put UF ahead 12-0.
“Bailey’s the type of 
player that’s going to aver -
age probably 20-type home runs per year,” Walton said. 
“She’s got that kind of capa-
bility. Those are the reasons why at the beginning of the year, you’re a little frustrat-ed with some of the lineup 
production because you’re 
missing someone like Bailey Castro or Brittany Schutte at full strength.”
The Gators’ stout hitting 
backed up starting pitcher Alyssa Bache, who retired the first nine batters she faced.
However, Bache (5-0) had 
a shaky fourth frame, facing seven batters and yielding three earned runs on three 
hits and a walk.
Despite the rocky inning, 
Bache remained in the circle 
for her third complete game of the season, striking out a 
career-high five batters in 
Florida’s win.
“[Run support] builds 
your confidence a lot, espe-
cially with the offense that 
we’ve been having lately,” Bache said. “Even in the first inning, I have confidence that we’re gonna score.”
