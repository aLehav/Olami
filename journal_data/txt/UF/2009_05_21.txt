New forensics information in the fatal 
shooting of a man by an Alachua County Sher-
iff’s deputy supports witness statements that 
the man continued to attack the officer after being Tasered.Nicholous Vertex Weeks, 18, was shot sev-
eral times on Friday by Lt. Mike Hanson in the intersection of NW 34th Street and 39th Av-enue after physical force and the use of a Taser gun did not stop Weeks from attacking the deputy, said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg. 
The preliminary autopsy shows that there were multiple shots fired because Weeks con-
tinued to attack Hanson even af-ter being shot several times.
“Witnesses said they thought 
the deputy was firing blanks be-cause Weeks wasn’t stopping,” 
Kameg said. 
Kameg said when Hanson arrived at the scene and tried to break up a fight between Weeks and a girl, Weeks came at the officer with force.
The deputy then shot Weeks with a Taser 
gun for five seconds.
Hanson attempted to use the Taser gun 
again when Weeks pulled the prongs from the Autopsy: Shooting victim attacked officer

After a 50-year hiatus, bedbugs 
are back in the developed world due to a resistance in currently used pesticides putting Americans at an 
increased risk of finding the critters 
in dorm and hotel rooms.Isolated incidents of bedbugs 
have occurred a few times this year in UF dorm rooms, according to Wayne Walker, senior pest control technician at UF.
Sharon Blansett, assistant direc-
tor of housing for research and orga-nizational development at UF, said the incidents occurred in graduate housing and family housing on 
campus.
Blansett said she attributes the in-
festations to students 
bringing the bugs back after traveling over-seas and buying previ-
ously infested furniture.
The outbreaks, which have also occurred at Ohio State University 
and other colleges, are treated with 
insecticides, extreme heat and steam cleaning, Walker said.
Margie Pfiester, a doctoral stu-
dent in the UF department of ento-mology who studies bedbugs, said that the old means of exterminating bedbugs have lost their effective-ness.
Entomologists are advocating the 
reintroduction of insecticides previ-ously banned by the Environmental Protection Agency, she said.

College students may start taking general education 
math and English classes more seriously soon.
The Florida Senate presented a bill on educational 
funding to Gov. Charlie Crist Friday. The bill will auto-
matically pass if not signed by Crist on May 30.
If approved, SB 1676 will go into effect July 1, accord-
ing to the Florida Senate Web site.
The bill will repeal the College 
Level Academic Skills Test adminis-tered to students who did not prove competency in communication and mathematics through general educa-
tion English and math courses, ac-
cording to UF’s Office of the Univer-
sity Registrar Web site.
Mostly affecting the funding for 
virtual schools and grade school issues, the bill contains 
one item that directly affects college students.
Students will not be able to earn an associate’s de-
gree or progress to upper-division work in a college or university without proving that they have college-level communication and mathematic skills, said UF CLAST Administrator Winifred Cooke.UF ACADEMICSBill to require

AP Source: 1st Gitmo detainee coming to US trial
WASHINGTON (AP) — An Obama administration official says 
a top al-Qaida suspect held at Guantanamo Bay will be sent to New 
York City for trial.
Ahmed Ghailani would be the first Guantanamo detainee brought 
to the U.S., and the first to face trial in a civilian criminal court.
An official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the per-
son was not authorized to disclose the decision, tells The Associated Press that the administration has decided to bring Ghailani to trial in New York. He was indicted there for the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa — attacks that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.Crist

A mockingbird grazes UF biology major Devon Duffy in an attempt to drive her away from 
its nest on the UF campus April 19. 
By HUNTER SIZEMORE
Alligator Staff Writer
Mockingbirds don’t take harassment 
lightly.
In fact, they’re likely to hold a grudge, a 
recent UF study found.
The birds remember people who threaten 
their nests and react sooner to targets they 
see as more threatening, according to the study published by several professors and students in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
“We may view all mockingbirds as alike, 
but it certainly doesn’t work the other way 
around,” said Douglas Levey, a UF profes-
sor who headed the study. “When you walk by a mockingbird perched on a rail near Re-itz Union, you are his business.” 
While researching urban mockingbird 
behavior in Gainesville, Christine Stracey, a UF biology graduate student, noticed that the birds became defensive when sighting her, while they ignored homeowners, gar-
deners and other non-threatening humans, 
she said.
In some cases, she believed that the birds 
could even spot her car, which she started parking out of sight of mockingbird nests.
After Stracey discussed the behavior with 
Levey, they developed a study in which 24 nests were located on UF’s campus, and the birds’ reactions to aggressors were tested.
A study participant would approach and 
touch a nest four days in a row, and on the fifth day a new participant would repeat the process.
The mockingbirds would leave their 
nests increasingly early as the first study participant approached but did not react to the second participant until threatened.
This behavior gives the mockingbird an 
edge in urban environments, Stracey said.
“Imagine if you were a mockingbird and 
you attacked everyone you saw,” she said. “In a place like Butler Plaza or on campus, you wouldn’t have any time to feed yourself or your babies.”Study: Birds hold grudges� THE GROUP WILL SET UP 
ABOUT 4,950 TOMBSTONES.
At 2 a.m. Saturday, while most 
students are sleeping or coming 
home from a night of partying, the 
Gainesville Veterans For Peace 
will be setting up about 4,950 tombstones along Eighth Avenue. 
Starting at Northwest 34th 
Street, there will be one tombstone for each soldier who has died in Iraq. The tombstones will be dis-played through Monday, Memo-
rial Day, for visitors to come place 
flowers, write messages and pay their respects, said Scott Camil, a twice-wounded Vietnam veteran 
and the coordinator of the Gainesville Chapter of VFP.
“It’s a graphic 
representation of how many guys have died,” said John Fullerton, a Vietnam veteran and member of VFP. 
Fullerton hopes the display 
will remind people that Memorial Day is about honoring the soldiers who have lost their lives in war. 
“It is very important to remem-
ber that these guys did what they were told for their country,” he said. 
There will also be information 
available regarding the cost of the war, particularly how much of Gainesville’s tax dollars have 
been spent on war funding.

� HE DIED ON APRIL 30.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
Ronald Stiles III would have been ecstatic 
to see his Orlando Magic finally make it to the 
NBA Eastern Conference Finals.
But his dad will cheer on the team for him, 
remembering the team spirit he shared with his son, a UF senior who died April 30 in a surfing accident at Crescent Beach, Fla., Ronald Stiles Jr., Ronald’s dad, said his son went with three of his friends to relax after final exams.
“The sheer number of people who showed 
up and spoke to us at his funeral was a partial testimony of the impression he left on people,” Stiles said.
Before attending UF, Ronald earned his as-
sociate degree from Valencia Community Col-lege in Orlando.
“He had taken five classes in the spring, 
which was something he had never done,” Stiles said.
Stiles said he was proud of his son for earn-
ing a 3.0 GPA while working at the O’Connell Center and in the kitchen at Café Gardens.
Stiles said he had never seen his son hap-
pier than the last time the two were together.
“He loved living in Gainesville,” he said, 
adding that his son was excited to start his new internship, where he would have coordi-nated sports events.Ronald, who was a recreation and sports 
major, loved sports since he was a kid and played basketball for the YMCA despite his 
father’s effort to turn him into a baseball player.
However, when he saw 
his son’s talent, Stiles wasn’t upset for long. 
“I couldn’t believe how 
good he was at his age,” 
he said. “When I sat in the stands, I was so proud and happy.” 
Ronald’s love for basketball didn’t end 
with his childhood basketball teams. He was also an Orlando Magic fan and watched the team, win or lose, from its first season.“Those were always good times in our 
house because it was family time,” Stiles said. “We’d sit around the TV with a bowl of pop-corn, and it was a great thing for us to do.”
When he was about 12, Ronald spent a short 
stint as a professional wrestling fan. Stiles said Ronald and his friends would practice moves on each other.
“We went through three or four bed frames 
during that time,” he said.
Ronald also loved music, listening to artists 
ranging from Huey Lewis to ZZ Top. He even made plans to take his grandmother to Grace-land to see Elvis’ estate.
“Not because he had to, but because that 
was just the kind of person he was,” Stiles said.

Gainesville Equal Opportunity director Jimmie Williams pauses while 
discussing a proposal during a meeting of the Gainesville Equal Op -
portunity Committee in City Hall Wednesday.
By ROBERTA O. ROBERTS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Poor children may get a leg up if Commissioner 
Jack Donovan has his way.
The issue of adding disadvantaged children as a 
new protected class to the city code of ordinances was 
brought up at Donovan’s recommendation during Wednesday’s Equal Opportunity Committee meet-
ing, among other issues such as education.
However, Stephanie Marchman, assistant city at-
torney, said there needs to be more research on the 
legal viability of the proposal. She added that no other 
cities in the country have this protection.
Donovan was not at Wednesday’s meeting to ad-
dress the Equal Opportunity Committee’s questions 
about the proposed addition. 
“We need more clarification from him,” said Com-
missioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa.
During the committee’s last meeting in April, Com-
missioner Donovan suggested adding an amendment to Chapter 8, the discrimination section of the city code of ordinances, to establish a category where the 
city “will not tolerate discrimination of children based 
on their socio-economic status.”
The chapter currently prevents discrimination 
based on race, color, creed, religion, gender, national origin, age, handicap, marital, family status, gender 
identity and sexual orientation. 
“If declared a discriminatory class, we would have 
some teeth to allocate resources to children with spe-cial needs to compensate for what their families may 
be unable to provide in social and economic terms,” Donovan said. 
Donovan added that by “social terms” he was re-
ferring to education. 
Donovan also sees the proposal as a tool to make 
sure disadvantaged children get to school. 
“Often a child wants to go, but their parents don’t 
have the means to get them to school. This leads to a very high truancy rate, which has a high correlation with crime rates and drop-out rates among teenag-ers,” he said.
Donovan feels optimistic that the protective class 
could help children achieve the American dream, he said.        
“I think both government and city and our com-
munity in general need to take a different approach than before so that every child has the right of life, lib-erty and pursuit of happiness because that translates to equal opportunity,” Donovan said.GAINESVILLE CITY GOVERNMENT

n THE REGULATIONS WILL GO INTO    
EFFECT IN NINE MONTHS.
WASHINGTON — Every American with 
a credit card will see sweeping changes in the 
market, with limits on sudden hikes in interest rates that drive consumers deeper into debt. Even cardholders who pay off their balance 
each month may face new annual fees or lose 
out on lucrative rewards programs.
Congress finished the legislation Wednes-day and sent it to President Barack Obama, who plans to sign it on Friday. The bill will revolutionize the market by restricting when and how a card company can raise interest rate, who can receive a card and how much time people are given to pay their bill.
The new rules — which go into effect in nine 
months — will protect debt-ridden consumers 
from many of the surprise charges common in 
the industry, such as over-the-limit fees and costs for paying a bill by phone.
“This cements a victory for every American consumer who has ever suffered at the hands 
of the credit card industry,” said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the 
Banking Committee.
But there will be losers 
too.
Banks, which oppose 
the legislation, will need to make up the cost some-where, and cardholders 
who pay off their balance in full each month could see new annual fees and lucrative re-wards programs canceled. Credit could be-come harder to come by too.
Some of the changes, including a require-
ment that cardholders receive 45-days notice before their rates are raised, are already on track to take effect in July 2010 under new regulations by the Federal Reserve. The legis-
lation would put these changes into law and 
go farther in restricting when and how banks charge people and who could get a card.

Darts & Laurels
While marital infidelity certainly runs rampant across Amer-
ica, there must be a statute of limitations restricting 78-year-old women from going ape-shit on their diaper-donning spouses. For beating the living crap out of her 85-year-old husband for allegedly cheating on her 35 years ago, the Department of 
Darts & Laurels tosses a let’s-just-say-bowls,-pipes-and-carpet-
sweepers-came-into-play DART at the sinister septuagenar-
ian. The damage? The laundry list of ailments included broken ribs, pelvis and a wrist.
Sadly, this was not a WWE “Anything Goes” match.With food stamps limiting consumers to a very strict selec-
tion of grocery store items (trust us), a bit of creative genius from one Pennsylvania man led to some pretty sweet results. The Department of Darts & Laurels awards a we-sure-could-
use-some-fake-money-down-here-in-Gainesville LAUREL to 
the confectionery conman for using a fake $20 coin to score 
some ice cream. A bogus $20 coin could feed a family of four at 
Leo’s — or one hungry Alligator staffer.
Did someone say rolls?When college freshmen leave home for the first time, there 
is a moment where they come to the realization they no lon-ger have to keep their bedrooms neat and tidy. For calling the cops on his adult son because he refused to clean his room (and 
for tossing a plate at him), the Department of Darts & Laurels 
chucks a parents-just-don’t-understand DART at Andrew Miz-
sak. Take this as a warning, faithful Darts & Laurels reader — avoid moving back in with your parents after you graduate at all costs.
There goes the neighborhood.Word out of North Carolina reveals news of an aspiring 
crook who turned to a piece of fruit to help him in his devious endeavors. The Department of Darts & Laurels presents a do-
tell-us-what-beats-an-edible-weapon LAUREL to John Szwalla 
for attempting to rob a store with nothing more than a banana. 
Hell, we’ve heard of criminals holding up stores with nothing more than their fingers pretending to be a gun, but a banana is just so much more imposing. 
Trust us when we say plantains work great, too.What could’ve been the greatest destination in China since 
the creation of the Great Wall, a still-under-construction sex amusement park will never host a single guest thanks to typical 
Chinese bureaucracy. For demolishing what would’ve proved 
to be a mecca for horny Asian couples and public masturbation, the Department of Darts & Laurels launches a we-couldn’t-wait-for-the-sex-technique-workshops DART at the Chinese 
government. Where else will the Chinese people be able to go to see giant-sized reproductions of male and female anatomy? 
Sure Rod Blagojevich will undoubtedly go down in infamy 
as one of the most despicable politicians in American history, but there is no denying the man has one helluva head of hair. 
The Department of Darts & Laurels extends a volumizing-for-
really-big-hair LAUREL to “Blago” shampoo for, well, giving 
us yet another excuse to write about our favorite former gover-nor from the great state of Illinois. The product’s slogan? “It’s Bleep’n Golden!”

Nancy Pelosi may be the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the most powerful woman in the history of American politics, but she is 
stunningly bad at being a public figure in the digital age.  Thankfully, her genius cats communicate so well for her on YouTube.
Even though she has been the leader of the Demo-
cratic House for a while, the only time Pelosi seems to shine is when she reflects poorly on her party and her people. Almost every time she opens her mouth, Pelosi creates controversy with dumb comments and dumber responses.
Her public speaking skills place her only slightly 
above Elmo from “Sesame Street.” When chopped up into sound bites, a Pelosi speech plays like Elmo’s vague-ly demented grandma, who somehow was elected to 
Congress.  
Today Pelosi is trying to dig her way out of a series 
of boneheaded comments about waterboarding and tor-
ture. Getting strapped to a board and almost drowning would be terrifying, but it has to be far more pleasant 
than having to listen to Pelosi stammer on about what 
she knew or when she knew it.
With all of this negativity and failure swirling around 
Speaker Pelosi, it is easy to overlook her profound im-
pact on today’s politics — the Capitol Cat Cam. Just type 
“Speaker Pelosi presents Capitol Cat Cam” into a You-Tube search and behold the hidden brilliance of a woman who obviously speaks most effectively through her act-ing cats.
Pelosi, via the conduit of her two fuzzy kitties, is clear-
ly combating the stagnant top-down flow of information and truth in our society with a clever and well-acted eso-teric cat play.
The gray cat, in an obvious refer-
ence to the Greek goddess Themis, 
rubs its face on a gavel that has 
fallen underneath a chair. The cat must have known that by bumping the symbol of justice it would be 
tweaking the very notion of justice 
itself — whether or not true justice was even an achievement possible 
for our flawed human societies. Well, that or it had an itchy face.
Cut to the next scene, and this time the black cat is 
sitting next to an arrangement of flowers (an allegory of the perfection of nature — such a brilliant cat). The cat turns its head to the left, and then continues the turn and 
almost twists its head all the way around so that kitty is 
practically facing backward. Maybe the cat heard a noise and looked around. Dig a little deeper, though, and see the cat acknowledge how Pelosi veers left on the political spectrum and, in classic pantomime form, shows how a 
way forward is possible with an eye trained on our ven-
erated past and the lessons of history.
The cats then both meet on a windowsill to gaze out 
onto the Washington Monument. They hold the pose in 
order to let the genius of their performance sink in. The 
video ends in a Rickroll, a nod to the obfuscating presence of the Internet in our everlasting search for the truth.
I can’t wait to see how the cats will handle this latest 
controversy — I wonder if they even make waterboards 
in cat size.

UF’s School of Theatre and Dance took its show 
on the road this week, headlining Florida’s First Coast 
Arts Festival in St. Augustine.
Throughout this week, the school will perform 11 
shows, said Kevin Marshall, the school’s director. 
“It is something we have never undertaken to the 
scale of this project,” Marshall said. 
The festival began on Monday and will continue 
each night through Sunday with performances of “Pride and Prejudice,” “The Complete Works of Wil-liam Shakespeare (Abridged)” and “Grease.”
In addition to the performing arts, the School of 
Art and Art History will present eight larger-than-life sized sculptures for visitors of the historic city to en-joy. 
The weather was a deterrent for some theatergoers 
this week.
“We’re hoping the skies will clear, and we will 
have a good turnout for the weekend,” said Stan Kaye, associate professor and lighting designer. 
Seating more than 4,000 spectators, the St. Augus-
tine Amphitheatre is on a 16-acre section of Anastasia State Park.
“One of the reasons why we’re doing this is to get 
the word out about the exceptional work we do here,” Marshall said. “Sometimes when you’re in a place like Gainesville, you become one of the best-kept secrets in the state.”
Along with modifying each show, moving multi-
ple productions from Gainesville to St. Augustine has 
taken more than a year of preparation. 
“We’re going into a venue that we don’t know,” 
Kaye said. “I think it’s great we’re bringing what we 
do to the public outside of the building we normally operate in.”
UF’s School of Theatre and Dance is hoping to pro-
mote the history of St. Augustine and the fine arts by working with the St. Augustine Tourist Development Council to bring visitors from around the state with sponsorships from NPR News and television adver-tisement.
Tickets are $20 and can be purchased at ticketmas-
ter.com, where a schedule of performances is listed.
“We’re expanding (our program) out to the St. 
Augustine area,” Marshall said. “We may be in 
Gainesville, but we’re definitely everywhere.”STATE

gun out of his skin and charged at 
Hanson. When Weeks went for Han-son’s gun, the deputy shot him mul-tiple times, killing him on the scene.
Week’s family has refused to 
speak with officials, despite numer-ous attempts to contact them, Kameg said.

why Weeks was at the intersection and how he got there.

Not all students have to take the exam, 
which is comparable to the SAT or ACT.
Most students are exempt through test 
scores or by earning a cumulative GPA of at 
least a 2.5 in specified communication and 
math classes, Cooke said.
“I didn’t know what the CLAST was or 
that we needed anything but a passing grade 
in those classes until I had a hold on my stu-dent record to take the exam,” said Sinteria Cooper, a health education and behavior ju-nior at UF. 
Cooper plans on taking the test this sum-
mer.
“They say you need a C, but they don’t 
really say anything about the 2.5 GPA,” she said.The bill may sound like good news to stu-
dents because it removes a test, but it does not remove the requirement that students must prove their ability in communication and computation.
Cooper is happy to see the test go but only 
if UF informs students of the ways they can be exempted from it before a hold is placed 
on their record.
If students do not satisfy the CLAST re-
quirements after earning 60 credits, a hold 
will appear on their record. According to UF’s Office of the University Registrar, stu-dents will not be able to register for classes if CLAST requirements are not met by the time they receive 96 credits.
Students who could have taken the 
CLAST will be able to verify their skills by retaking the courses that exempt students from the test.
Receiving a score of at least 500 on the 
SAT math and verbal portions, or a score of at least 22 on the ACT reading portion and 21 on the ACT English and math portions may also exempt students, according to UF’s CLAST exam alternative methods.
“I do not see how the repeal could be 
helpful for students, because when enacted into law (they) will have one less alternative for demonstrating their skills,” said Cooke.
The CLAST will still be administered on 
paper on June 6 before possibly becoming inactive July 1.
UF, which has had the right to develop 
and administer the exam statewide since 1996, will add times for the students to take 
the computerized version of the test during 
June if the bill is passed, Cooke said.traveling to prevent getting latched onto by the blood-suck-ing bugs.
When arriving at a hotel she 
puts her luggage down on a safe surface and strips her bed, check-ing for the apple seed-shaped bugs or traces of their fecal mat-ter, she said.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s a one-
star hotel or a five-star hotel, all beds are susceptible,” Pfiester said.Pfiester also said that the lull 
of bedbug infestation after World War II was a briefly enjoyed ab-normality.
“Bedbugs have been docu-
mented before Jesus,” Pfiester said. “Greeks and Romans wrote 
about bedbugs.”
Although the bugs are annoy-
ing and can have psychological 
consequences for those who are pestered by them, there is no evi-dence that they transmit disease, she said.
Bedbugs are much more of a 
problem for students who live off campus, even if they are less likely to contract them in their homes.
Orkin Pest Control in 
Gainesville offers Vikane fumi-gation, a very powerful treat-
ment that is three 
times as toxic as 
the one they use to treat termites and 
costs $700 to $800 per home.
Students who live in apart-
ment complexes are often at the mercy of their landlords, as Vikane cannot be applied to a single unit and must be applied to an entire apartment building. This would cost the building owner a huge amount of money, according to a pest control ser-vice technician at Orkin.
That’s why Margie Pfiester 
is so adamant about preventing 
bedbugs before they become a 
problem.
“You’re not going to just 
wake up with bedbugs one day, you’re going to get them from someplace,” Pfiester said. “And that is something you definitely do not want.”

“If everyone really knew 
what a jerk I am in real 
life, I wouldn’t be so 
adored in the slightest.”
Christian Bale11:Local artist Sergio 
Castro talks to the 
Avenue about his 
work and why it’s 
more important to 
follow your passion, 
not the money. 
13:12:11:
www.alligator.org/the_avenueTHURSDAY, MAY 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11
Art is not where Sergio Castro wanted to 
take his life when he started at Santa Fe Col-
lege as a general business major. He started helping his friend with her art homework and unveiled a talent that has changed his career path, earned him local recognition and put 
some serious money in his pocket. 
Castro, 22, changed his major to studio art 
after realizing his talent and passion for art, 
trading in a future in the business world for a future in something he said he knows will make him happy. 
“Monetary reimbursement only lasts so 
long,” said Castro. “I want to give 110 percent of myself in what I’m doing. For me happiness 
is most important – waking up and being hap-
py with what you’re going to do that day.” 
His big break in the Gainesville art scene 
came with a showing at Sharab Lounge where a bartending job gave him the opportunity to show some of his work. “Everything leads to something else,” says 
Castro of his opportunities in Gainesville. “It’s a good cultural breeding ground, just from around town and seeing how everyone communicates, it’s a good place to work out of because there’s a lot of inspiration. If you embrace what you do and you’re happy with it, the negativity is outweighed.” 
Castro’s inspiration 
comes from the little things that give life character. 
As a child, he hated 
trips to antique shows and stores with his mom, an interior designer in Orlando, until he got closer to the pieces and noticed their texture, the little things that make each piece unique. 
Castro makes visits to “The Junk Lady,” a 
woman who sets up camp on State Road 441 and sells things that have been dropped off on about two or three acres of land, for inspira-tion. His latest find, a luggage trunk dated back 
to World War II, will be part of a new series of paintings he plans on working on this sum-mer. 
“With my work, I like to draw attention 
to simplicity,” he said, showing a piece he re-
cently entered in a national competition and pointing out that it was one of his simplest pieces to date. 
“Not everything needs an 
overly deep meaning to be good.” 
He said when he started 
painting, he was into neatness and perfection, clean lines and no errors. 
One piece that he found particularly well-
made was criticized by professors for lack of personality and praised for a corner of the can-
vas where the paint had dried in bubbles.  
       A professor told him it was the little things in the work that makes something successful.        
He finds success in his pieces when they evoke emotion in the spectators. 
“I went from a really elementary, closed 
mindset and now, I go into [painting] with a lot of things in my mind,” he said. 
From displaying his work at Sharab and 
Wolfgang, Castro has gained a local recogni-tion that has allowed him to work with Tim Tebow’s First and 15 philanthropy, Cottage Grove apartments, University House apart-ments and has been asked to paint murals in 
local homes and fraternity houses. 
In the fall, Castro will start as a junior trans-
fer student in the drawing program at UF.  
      Before the end of the summer, Castro hopes to have a new series ready to put on display as a marking point in his new chapter. 
The series will be his first attempt to keep a 
cohesive theme throughout several pieces.  
“I just want to be as successful as I can, but 
at the same time, I want to show other art-ists that they can do the same thing,” he said. “That if you have a talent, get out there and benefit from it.”

Local artist draws from charms of everyday life
In a time of tight budgets and limited resourc-
es, UF musical theater students keep singing and dancing. Economic hardships and stormy weather don’t stop these performers from sharing their tal-ents with the world. 
On Monday, UF’s musical theater department 
performed “Grease” at the St. Augustine Amphi-theatre to kick off Florida’s First Coast Arts Festi-val.
The students rehearsed the show in just three 
weeks after learning they could not perform their fall production of “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” due to copyright issues.
While “Grease” is an inherently cheesy play, 
these talented students brought the show to life with its full potential of campiness. If you missed the first showing, tonight you will have another chance to catch it tonight. 
Their show hosted some technical diffivulties, 
but despite the wind and drizzle gusting through the outdoor theater, which fortunately had at least a roof, the cast managed to keep smiling and keep the audience laughing. The show hosted some fun surprises, like the 
“Greased Lightning” car actually drove around stage and they even included a special Gator shout out.
Overall, the colorful costumes and sock hop-
style music were perfect for the family-filled audi-ence and the family-oriented aim of the event.
Tony Mata, the founding artistic director of 
the festival and the director of “Grease,” has been working for three years to create this event “to showcase our talent outside of UF.”
Florida’s First Coast Festival will hopefully be 
the first of many annual weeklong festivals that 
bring various UF performances and artistic works 
to St. Augustine.  
The inaugural festival, which began May 18, 
included renditions of “Pride and Prejudice,” an opera, a sculpture exhibit and an orchestra. 
The event ends with reruns of “Grease” and 
Pride and Prejudice, and final showing of “The Complete Works of Shakespeare, Abridged.”  
“It is a difficult time to start a theater program 
with the arts going under and the economy going against us,” Mata said.  “But I think we’re going to make it.”UF takes act to east coast
A flexible  5-foot-1 inch, 
100-pound female twirls upside down on a pole, with her long brown hair sweeping the floor, her 6-inch heels almost scrape the ceil-
ing, before straddling the air and 
then sliding down onto all fours. 
Rowdy or disconsolate men 
dishing dollar bills don’t surround her. Here, there are only cheers from supportive females, waiting their turn. 
French Addiction, 819 W. Uni-
versity Ave., has offered pole danc-
ing classes since September. 
Mary Jane Brunel, owner of 
French Addiction, attends the class 
on Wednesday nights. 
“It’s a wonderful way to drop 
into your femininity,” she said. “Sometimes we’ll begin classes with wine or chocolate, so we all can get in the mood.” 
Rebecca Butler, 22, teaches the 
class on Wednesdays and Sundays.      “It’s the best job I’ve ever had,” she said. “I get to shake my booty and have an impact on the lives of the women I teach.” 
One pupil started the class af-
ter she noticed her sexual energy drained from caring for her three 
kids. After a month of lessons, dur-
ing a ‘check-out’ session — the girl talk portion that concludes every pole dancing class — the woman explained how the steel pole and 
6-inch heels were the strap-on con-fidence she was missing. 
“It almost made me cry,” Butler 
said. “This class is about being your-self. We wear masks every day for our teachers, our bosses, our chil-dren, our friends. But here, everyone accepts you for who you are.” 
Pole dancing is also a great work-
out — an hour of pole dancing burns 250 calories, tones arm muscles and 
increases flexibility.
Classes are held Monday, 
Wednesday and Sunday, and cost 
$60 for a four-week  package. Pole restores confidence

Muggy 
days make for steamy hot nights
If you’re stuck in Gainesville 
all summer then you definitely 
won’t be splashing around at 
the beach like Danny and Sandy, 
but that doesn’t mean you can’t have your own sexy summer nights—or even days. 
As you struggle to fight the blis-
tering hot sun, you might think the 
right thing to do is cool off, but the truth? It’s way more fun to heat things up. 
Follow these suggestions of how 
to keep your summer sexy and you’ll be saying, “That’s hot” more often than Paris Hilton did in 2006. 
First things first, living in Florida 
we can’t expect anything other than warm, humid weather. So, summer is the perfect time to forfeit your bat-tle with the AC because humidity 
only steams things up (not to men-
tion it will lower the effects of global warming—hotter and ‘greener’ sex, 
all in one!). 
The Sun-
shine State of-
fers the perfect 
sex weather. Having sex in 
the cold is just not as good, not as sexy and obviously, not as hot. 
Going at it isn’t all that great 
when your nipples are hard and you’ve got goose bumps replacing your freshly shaven legs. 
But I understand that you don’t 
want to feel muggy and wet all day, which brings about suggestion num-ber two. Taking a post-sex shower can cool things off right away while concurrently heating them back up. 
Need a major cool down? There’s 
no better time to crack open a couple beers, or mix up some pina coladas, 
both of which will undoubtedly get 
you back in the mood. You could even take a (skinny) dip in the pool.
And, so, this brings me to perhaps 
the most important facet of having a sexy summer: pool parties. College students stripped down to teeny 
bikinis or super cool swim trunks, 
bodies wet and glistening from both tanning oil and alcohol spilled from upside-down margaritas, how could this not be sexy? 
These parties epitomize sexiness 
and offer an ideal way to meet some-one to heat things up with. In order 
to score a sex partner, be sure not to 
drink too much. We all know how fun drunk sex can be, but sloppy sex is just the opposite. That being said, try to keep your bathing suit on at all times by the pool. If your suit slips off during a wild chicken fight, that’s okay, but try to stray from the girls—or boys—gone wild image. 
So, there you have it, summer 
sex tips to keep your stifling days as steamy as ever. If you savor the sweltering sun, your sexy stories will leave your friends begging you, “Tell me more, tell me more!” SummerSexASHLEY ROSS  � AVENUE WRITER

376.4482ChineseChinese FondueThis summer you will be feeling more than 
the heat. Textured fabrics and ruffled pieces are 
dominating the fashion industry this season, from models on designer runways to students on Gainesville’s sidewalks.
This play on fabrics creates hands-on outfits 
that are reminiscent of a childhood summer with fun, floral prints and romantic ruffles.
Ruffles have been making waves in all as-
pects of the fashion world since the 1500s. Roy-
als, like Queen Elizabeth, lined their wrists and 
necks with ruffles as symbols of high status in society. Colonial men wore light ruffles on their collars and wrists under their suit jackets to add flare, and in the culture of Spanish fla-menco dancers, layers of flowing fabric accen-tuated each dancer’s twists and turns.
Today, ruffles are for everyone. Such pieces 
owned the runway of high-end designers like Roberto Cavalli, Valentino, Zac Posen and Dolce & Gabbana, to name a few. And celeb-rities can’t seem to get enough. Stylistas such as Leighton Meester and Nicole Richie have stayed faithful to the trend by adorning ruffles to more than one event. 
Almost every fashion show this season 
hosted extravagant dresses, so wide and volu-minous they spilled off the runway.
Of course, these dresses, or rather works 
of art, are impractical for Gainesville’s fash-ion scene. But thanks to more pocket-friendly brands like Pink at Victoria’s Secret or Xhilara-tion at Target, ruffles are moving from the run-way into reality. The remarkable thing about ruffles is that they will look elegant at every end of the price spectrum. This fashion detail of the season can be found in most stores with a 
designer vibe at a reason-able value. 
Flaunt this feminine 
trend by picking up 
one of these pieces. Have fun playing with the volume of your outfit but don’t overdo it. Ruffle overdose and busy prints can add  
unnecessary bulk that weighs down the airy feel of the outfit. Stick to one statement piece like a flower print, tiered tank top and pair it with skinny jeans. Less risky rufflers can find a solid-colored blouse with a ruffled accent - just enough to add a gentle touch of three-dimen-sionality.
Whether you dress it up or dress 
it down, when worn correctly, this trend will leave your ruffles and minds  
blowing in the summer breeze.THURSDAY, MAY 21, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 13

ONLINE SEC BASEBALL AWARDS SEC ALL-SPORTS TROPHY SEC FOOTBALL NEWS� UF WILL FACE OLE MISS TODAY IN THE 
LOSER’S BRACKET.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
HOOVER, Ala. — Arkansas wasn’t able to score its first 
earned run until the ninth inning of Wednesday’s game 
against UF, but 7 unearned runs through the first eight frames were enough to give the seventh-seeded Razorbacks an 8-5 upset win over the second-seeded Gators in the first 
round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament. 
The Gators (38-19, 19-12 SEC) committed four errors 
on the day, their highest total since logging six miscues in 
the regular-season series finale with Arkansas (33-20, 15-15 SEC) on March 15. 
Senior starter Stephen Locke (4-2, 4.55 ERA), who wasn’t 
on UF’s opening-day roster because of a DUI charge that was later dropped, fell victim to his team’s defensive lapses, lasting 3.2 innings while surrendering 6 runs on eight hits. 
“We kind of knew the style of Stephen Locke,” Arkansas 
coach Dave Van Horn said. “He wasn’t going to be able to throw the ball by you, so our left handers can just stay on the ball. He’s a strike thrower so we just told them to be aggressive.”
The Razorbacks have now won five in a row against 
Gators and nine of the last 10. The loss also runs UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan’s postseason record to 0-5 after the Gators were swept out of the SEC Tournament and NCAA Region-
al last season. 
In the postgame press conference, O’Sullivan said he is 
more concerned about his team’s defense than ending the 
losing streak. Gators fall to Razorbacks in SEC Tournament opener
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF freshman Preston Tucker had the Gators’ lone hit with runners in scoring position in their 8-5 loss to Arkansas in 
Wednesday’s opening round of the SEC Tournament in Hoover, Ala. Tucker was named SEC Co-Freshman of the Year. 
HOOVER, Ala. 
This is the big stage, and UF 
didn’t look ready for it.
Quite literally, the South-
eastern Conference Tournament is a bigger stage than the Gators are used to. That was clear in the first inning, when first baseman Preston Tucker hit a deep shot to right. 
It would likely have cleared the 
fence at the friendly confines of 
McKethan Stadium, but instead, the 
larger dimensions of Regions Park 
swallowed it up for a flyout.
This is the postseason, and UF is 
going to have to go a little beyond the usual effort to get things done.
Rather than rolling seventh-seed-
ed Arkansas, the Gators sputtered to an 8-5 loss. They caught most of the breaks but made enough sloppy mistakes to give back their good for-
tune.
The Razorbacks entered the game having 
lost eight of their previous 
10, and they 
were without top hitter and starting short-stop Scott 
Lyons. UA’s 
ace, Dallas Keuchel, was off his game, 
walking a career-high six batters en 
route to his second-shortest outing 
of the year (3.2 innings).
Second-base umpire Ken Couch 
even made a kick-save to keep an Arkansas run off the books in the first inning, as a grounder up the 
middle struck his leg and the runner 
who would’ve scored was forced to remain at second base.
But none of that was enough be-UF not ready for Hoover’s 
pressure-packed play

Maybe history does repeat itself.
A week after hosing a regional includ-
ing Texas A&M, which knocked UF out of the postseason the last two years, the No. 1 
Gators (58-3) will welcome another familiar 
opponent to Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
No. 14 California (38-18) will travel to 
Gainesville to face UF in the NCAA Super Re-gional for the second straight year. The Bears swept their way through the Tallahassee Re-
gional to return to the Super Regionals.
The best-of-three series will begin Satur-
day night at 8 p.m. with the opening game 
televised on ESPN. Game 2 will be played Sunday at 6 p.m., and if necessary, the final game is slated to start at 8 p.m. Sunday’s ac-
tion will be broadcasted on ESPN2.
Last year, the Gators beat the Bears by winning the first two games by identical 4-2 
scores, with the final victory coming in nine innings.
Unlike last season, however, UF is enter-
ing super regionals without a postseason 
loss. This year’s squad swept through the 
regional, while the 2008 Gators dropped one 
of two to Central Florida before advancing.
Despite its early postseason 
success, UF isn’t losing sight of 
its ultimate goal of a national ti-
tle. And even though UF hasn’t lost two games to a single op-
ponent in the last two years, the team is not 
overlooking anyone.

“I don’t look at it that way. We just 
haven’t played well,” he said. “When you 
make four errors, your chances of winning aren’t very good. The reason we were able to get back in the game was because of the 
nine walks.”
UF was able to get runners on base via 
the free pass but was held to four hits — all 
singles — and missed multiple opportuni-ties to drive in runners. In the ninth, sopho-more Josh Adams came to the plate with the bases loaded and one out before grounding into a game-ending double play.
Arkansas reliever Mike Bolsinger was 
credited by both coaches for holding UF to one hit in 4.1 innings of work — the only one being a two-run single by Preston Tucker. 
Tucker, the SEC Co-Freshman of the 
Year, recorded the Gators’ lone hit with run-ners in scoring position, cutting the lead to 6-5.  His three RBIs against Arkansas brings his UF freshman season record to 74. He needs six more to tie Ryan Shealy’s school 
record set in 2002. 
The loss sets UF up with a matchup 
against Ole Miss at 11 a.m. today in an 
elimination game. The Gators dropped their regular-season series to the Rebels 2-1 in Gainesville and is now 7-9 against SEC West competition. The Gators boast a 12-3 
record against SEC East teams. 
If the Gators lose to the Rebels, they will 
likely still host an NCAA Regional but will 
be forced to go on the road should they ad-vance to a super regional. 
O’Sullivan said he won’t be happy with 
settling for just one round in Gainesville. 
“We’re looking to win this thing. That’s 
why we’re here,” he said. “We were on the bus for eight hours.” 
“I wouldn’t expect us to come up here 
for anything less than trying to win every game we possibly can. We’re playing for, in my mind, probably a national seed.”
National seeds are awarded to the top 
eight teams in the country and guarantee home NCAA Tournament games until the College World Series in Omaha, Neb.
Freshman Anthony DeSclafani (5-3, 
4.74 ERA) is scheduled to take the mound against Ole Miss.cause UF didn’t show up.
The Gators made four errors and put 
together just four hits, all singles, and they 
didn’t look primed to end UF’s 18-year conference tournament drought.
Tucker’s 2-run single in the fourth was 
the team’s only hit with runners in scor-ing position. There were needless bunt attempts when good hitters should have been swinging away. 
There were plenty of pitches clocked in 
the 65-mph range, and even though I’m a little skeptical of the radar gun’s accuracy, 
that’s not the kind of dominant pitching 
you want on your side at this stage of the season.
Now, I don’t mean to dump all over 
this team. The Gators have far surpassed my expectations this year. They’re going to host an NCAA regional, and if they 
can pull themselves together, beat No. 7 
Mississippi on Thursday and win another game or two, they’re likely to earn a na-tional seed and the right to host a super regional as well.
But all that comes from UF’s exem-plary 38-18 regular-season record. The 
postseason is different, and what I saw on 
Wednesday didn’t exactly inspire confi-
dence that this team will do something last year’s team couldn’t  — win in the post-season.
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan is only in his 
second year, and it’s crystal clear that he has the program headed in the right di-rection. But the Gators lack two things 
necessary for tournament success: a deep, 
experienced pitching staff and a few legit sluggers.
UF will be relying on plenty of young 
arms — talented young arms with tons of potential, but still young and unproven.
It seems like most teams are aware of 
Tucker’s power and try to avoid him, but the Gators need Avery Barnes, Josh Ad-ams, Brandon McArthur and Matt den Dekker to start clicking at the same time.
If that happens, UF will be a force. A 
loss Thursday wouldn’t be enough to de-clare the Gators’ hopes of reaching the Col-lege World Series dead, but they can’t have 
a repeat of Wednesday’s performance.
One or two more of those outings 
would mean the end of the line, no matter 
how many breaks they catch.

“Right now, I think we’ve done a good job. We’ve played well. We’ve 
done a good job rising to the chal-
lenge all season. Now, we’ve got an-other challenge here at home.”
The forward-looking approach 
is evident in the Gators as much as 
it is in their coach. After cruising 
through regional play in three games — the closest of which was a 7-1 victory against Texas A&M — out-
fielder Kelsey Bruder said the team 
wouldn’t be focusing on its past suc-cesses for long.
“We can savor it for the rest of the 
day, but Tuesday, it’s back to work preparing for the super regionals,” Bruder said Sunday. “We came out strong, but we’re just happy to move on.”
California swept the Tallahassee 
Regional behind the arm of junior Marissa Drewrey (24-10, 2.12 ERA), 
who pitched all 21 innings for the 
Bears. Drewrey took both losses 
against UF in last year’s super re-
gionals.

Hump day was not a good one for most of 
the Gators tennis players. 
In the first round of the NCAA singles 
tournament in College Station, Texas, three UF players lost in straight sets, but one held firm to advance.
No. 33 Alex Lacroix was the first to fall, 
losing to Pepperdine’s Omar Altmann. The No. 44 player beat the UF sophomore 6-3, 6-4. Lacroix went into the tournament with a 20-7 spring record with nine of his wins coming against ranked opponents.
Freshman Carlos Cueto dropped back-
to-back sets to No. 3 Bryan Koniecko. Cueto faced a tough draw going against the highly ranked Buckeye in a 6-3, 6-2 loss.
Koniecko’s Ohio State was defeated Tues-
day in a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of USC in the finals of the team tournament, so it was a rebound match for the senior.
“The season is over with for the team, so 
you have to focus on yourself for a little bit for the one week that you are here and play your own game,” Koniecko said after his win.
On the women’s side, No. 40 Anastasia 
Revzina fell to California’s Marina Cossou. The No. 26-ranked sophomore, whose team was swept in Tuesday’s national champion-ship 4-0 by Duke, defeated the Gators junior 
6-2, 6-3.
No. 8 Marrit Boonstra also played a Gold-
en Bear in Bojana Bobusic. The junior leader 
of the women’s squad took the No. 32 player deep into a third set before closing it out in a tiebreaker 6-3, 3-6, 7-6.
In Thursday’s second round, Boonstra 
takes on Christy Striplin of Georgia Tech, who 
defeated Northwestern’s Sa-mantha Murray 6-4, 6-4.
DOUBLES TEAMS START 
PLAY: Though the teams’ seasons are over and singles didn’t go quite their way, the Gators are still 
represented in the doubles draws beginning today in College Station.
The No. 16 tandem of Antoine Benneteau 
and Joey Burkhardt are scheduled to face Tex-as A&M’s Austin Krajicek and Conor Pollock, who defeated the UF duo 8-4 en route to a 6-1 Gators victory in a heated battle on Jan. 31.
Boonstra and Jo Mather, who have played 
as a unit since the seventh match of the season, put together a 15-5 record and are ranked No. 18. The pair will play North Carolina’s Sophie Grabinski and Sanaz Marand. The Tar Heels handed the Gators their first heartbreaking loss of the season on Valentine’s Day, but Gra-biniski and Marand faced Boonstra and then-partner Megan Alexander, who played her second-to-last match of the season that day.
Revzina and Jessica Alexander will trade 
volleys with Texas Christian’s Macall Har-
kins and Anna Sydorska. The No. 18 pairing 
of Revzina and Alexander has been solid all 
season, finishing with a 19-4 record.
