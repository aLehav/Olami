0 MASTRODICASA ASKED
FOR INPUT ON TAXIS.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Student senators played it safe
at Tuesday night's Senate meet-
ing.
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, a
Gainesville City Commissioner
and UF Assistant Vice President
for Student Affairs, spoke with
the Student Senate during Tues-
day's meeting about safe trans-
portation options and possible
improvements that can be made to
Gainesville taxi services.
Mastrodicasa said she wanted
to hear the opinions of senators
so she can recommend improve-
ments to taxi services to the City of
Gainesville's Public Safety Com-
mittee.
"We are in the business ofmaking good policy, but we often
don't know what's going on on the
street," Mastrodicasa said.
Mastrodicasa said students
with official complaints about
Gainesville cabs should contact the
Gainesville Police Department.
She said the cab industry has
room to grow.
"It's not the most mature indus-
try," Mastrodi-
casa said. "Per-
sonally, I think
there's room for
improvement."
Senate Presi-
dent Ashton
Charles said
Mastrodicasa the high prices
sometimes dis-
courage students from using the
taxi service.
"That is just something that re-
ally has a cyclical effect and nega-
tively affects safety," Charles said.

Doctor speaks about
Black History Month
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Dr. Ben Carson wants to see the
day when people don't need a Black
History Month.
In his opinion, the ultimate goal
is a world in which people can be
happy celebrating that simple thing
people all have in common: human-
ity.
"I hope someday we reach a point
where it's everybody celebrating ev-
erybody," he said.
Carson, a renowned black neuro-
surgeon, came to UF last week as the
24th annual Martin Luther King Jr.
speaker.During his speech, Carson de-
scribed his journey from his days
as a young boy struggling to get
through elementary school
to his current position as a
widely respected pediat-
ric neurosurgeon.
He said he hopes
students understand
the importance
-.-of supporting
Black History the country's
Month education sys-
tem.
"The real key is learning and un-
derstanding what your gifts and tal-
ents are and not trying to fit a square
peg into a round hole," he said.LOCAL
Supermarkets help Haiti
By REBECCA GREENWOOD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Some grocery shoppers are thinking about
more than paper versus plastic.
They're choosing to help Haiti relief efforts
by donating at the register.
A fundraising program at Publix Super
Markets, which was created Jan. 13, allows
customers to donate by adding any amount of
money to their total when they check out.
The program, which includes Gainesville
Publix locations and Publix Super Markets in
five states, raised about $4 million as of Mon-
day morning, said Dwaine Stevens, Publix
spokesman.
The money is channeled through the Amer-
ican Red Cross and designated for the Haiti Re-
lief and Development Fund, Stevens said.
Other local stores are also helping the relief
efforts.
Angie Mohr, a store manager at Ward's Su-
per Market, said Ward's is letting Sister Hazel
Angel of Mercy Ministries use a building it
owns on Northwest Sixth Street to store Haitirelief supplies.
Ward's also placed donation buckets at reg-
isters to collect money for the American Red
Cross.
"When issues like this come up,
we react and get insight as quickly
as we can to determine what is the
best way to aid in times of disas-
te r."
Dwaine Stevens
Publix spokesman
Heaven Fischer, store customer service sales
manager at Sweetbay Supermarket on South-
west 34th Street, said the Sweetbay on South-
west 34th Street has collected about $1,000 for
the American Red Cross.
More than $114,000 in customer donations
have been collected from Sweetbay Supermar-
kets throughout Florida, Fischer said.

SG parties finish interviewing possible candidates
Elections will be held Feb. 23 and 24
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Slating interviews for Student
Senate positions with the Unite
Party and the Student Alliance
party finished Tuesday.
Unite Party spokesman Ben
Meyers said the Unite Party in-
terviewed 269 students during
the past three days.
Meyers said the party inter-
viewed 181 students on Tuesday
alone.
Jonathan Ossip, the Senate
leader for the Student Alliance
party, said the
Student Student Alli-Government ance party in-
terviewed 94
students during the three days of
qualifying interviews, including
about 40 students on Tuesday.
Supervisor of Elections Ariana
Alfonso could not give a specific
number of how many students
interviewed with the parties by
press time.
"It was a solid turnout, and I
think those candidates that have
been chosen are going to do great
with the task they've been giv-
en"
Ossip said he was pleased
with the caliber and quantity ofstudents who came to slate with
his party.
"They're all extremely pas-
sionate, extremely dedicated, and
they all have the ideas and the vi-
sion to lead this university," hesaid.
He said the Student Alliance
party wanted to find students
with more than just experience
in SG.
"We like to branch out and seestudents that are involved in all
aspects of university life," Ossip
said.
Meyers said he is also im-
pressed with the quality of stu-
dents who came to interview for
Senate positions.
"It's just extremely exciting
and pretty humbling that they all

positions to represent UF's colleges.wanted to come and slate with
us," Meyers said.
He said the Unite Party is
looking for students who are mo-
tivated and experienced and who
have ideas to represent a diverse
campus.
"We've got all three," Meyers
said. "Some of the most motivat-
ed people I've ever seen are ready
to hit the ground running."
Meyers said he was proud of
his party and the people interest-
ed in joining it.
"I just wish we could slate
them all," Meyers said.
UF freshman Lindsey Sand-
house said she wanted to slate
with the Unite Party because she
feels it represents ordinary stu-
dents.
"I just really wanted to get in-
volved on campus," she said.
UF junior Bobby Stevens said
he chose to slate with the Student
Alliance party because he also
wanted to be more involved with
SG.
"I want to eliminate perks
given to student officials who
should be serving their school,"
Stevens said.
Students will know if they
have been chosen by the parties
by 9 p.m. Wednesday.

Fewer animals
adopted in '09
By DANIELLE LOGAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The recession is leaving animals without a
home.
More owners are giving up their pets because
they can no longer afford the care, said David
Flagler, director of Alachua County Animal Ser-
vices.
Last year, the shelter took in about 7,500 ani-
mals, and 834 dogs and cats were adopted, a de-
crease from 871 in 2008, according to the shelter's
annual report.
"One of the worst things is that pet owners are
taking shortcuts for the care of their own pets,"
Flagler said.
Around Dr. Julie Levy, director ofGainesville Maddie's Shelter Medicine Pro-
gram at UF, said intakes and eu-
thanasias have been decreasing the past few years
thanks to rescue groups, but finding a way to in-
crease adoptions this year is a priority.
"There may be some subtle increase in relin-
quishments, but the greater challenge is that
adoptions are way down," Levy said.
Impulse adoptions were more likely before the
recession, Flagler said, but things aren't back to
normal yet.
"The economy could be improving," Flagler
said. "But it would still take several months to a
year before it filters down to where it affects the
animals."

* CURRENCE PLAYED TO ABOUT 50.
By GLENN COINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
As the lights dimmed and the murmur of
the crowd was replaced by a soulful voice and
the chimes of a keyboard, the Orange & Brew
transformed into an old jazz club.
Rudy Currence, 24, of South Carolina, took
the stage Tuesday night, serenading an audi-
ence of about 50 for about an hour and a half.
The performance was co-sponsored by the
Orange & Brew and the UF committee for
Black History Month 2010, which organized
Black History Month events for the univer-
sity.
Kamali-Ann Burke, executive director of
UF's Black History Month and a public rela-
tions senior, said she thought Currence's mu-
sic, with its feel-good lyrics, really fit this year's
Black History Month theme, "A Love Story."
Currence performed a variety of original
songs, one about his life growing up in Rock
Hill, South Carolina and his dream to pursue
a musical career. One song included the lyrics,
"I wasn't black enough so I got picked on, but
I wasn't white enough."
He also sang bits of popular songs such as
Outkast's "So Fresh, So Sing" and some tradi-
tional gospel songs.
At one point he broke out with the electric
slide, daring the audience to get up and do the
dance. Eight people joined in.
Currence recently signed a record deal with
Ludacris's label, Disturbing the Peace, and Mic
Check Entertainment.
Currence was paid about $2,000 for the per-
formance, said Tonya Dawson, program coor- Juliana Jimenez / Alligator

Haitian orphans get help in Fla
By NATHAN BEAM
Alligator Contributing Writer
In response to Haiti's earth-
quake, Florida is preparing
foster homes to take in Haitian
orphans by waiving homes' oc-
cupancy limitations.
In the aftermath of Port-au-
Prince's collapse, various or-
ganizations are working to get
orphaned children out of Haiti
and into a more stable environ-
ment.
"Everyone here is sleeping in
the dirt," said Kyle Shropshire,
an aid worker at an orphanage
in Bon Repos, Haiti.
"The kids are dehydrated and
almost all of them have picked
up diseases, Shropshire said.
"This is no place for a child."
Florida foster homes are
providing treatment for Hai-
tian children entering the U.S.
Children can be placed in fosterhomes after going through med-
ical checks.
Debra Skipper, a foster moth-
er from Seminole County, has
already seen several Haitian
children enter the U.S.
"Everyone here is sleeping
in the dirt. The kids are
dehydrated and almost all
of them have picked up
diseases. This is no place
for a child."
Kyle Shropshire
aid worker in Bon Repos, Haiti
"They are coming to our
homes with nothing," Skipper
said. "Some don't speak Eng-
lish, and they are coming from
a totally different culture. We
are honored to help with the
children, but the challenges are
different."
Zachary Kee, a missionaryand UF graduate, was in Mes-
sailler, Haiti, during the earth-
quake. He said he has high hopes
for the Haitian children.
"I don't feel that there is any
unavoidable danger in the cul-
ture change," Kee said.
While Florida may be chang-
ing laws to enable more orphans
to come in, Skipper believes the
state could do more.
"Background checks on new
foster homes should be done
rapidly, and we should take
emergency funds from our gov-
ernment to accommodate these
actions immediately," she said.
As the extent of the damage
in Haiti becomes more clear, Kee
believes one thing is certain.
"If there is anything to do
now, it is to help those who are
most in need," he said. "This is
no time to look back while a na-
tion catches fire."

Man arrested for
drugs, punching
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Kbein@aligator org
A Gainesville man is facing six charges and a $92,000 bail after
an argument Tuesday that left one victim with bloodied lips.
Terrence Williams, 29, was in a fight about loud music and
punched the victim in the mouth, cutting the victim's upper and
lower lips open, police said.
A witness tried to break up the fight until Williams pulled out
a gun and pointed it at the victim, according to aLocal police report.News The victim escaped when Williams dropped his
weapon and left in a car, police said.
Williams was found outside of Gardenia Gardens Apartments,
1700 NE Eighth Ave. Police found three semi-automatic handguns,
about 200 rounds of ammunition and a safe containing about half
a gram of marijuana in plain sight, police said.
Williams is charged with one count of aggravated assault, one
count of simple battery, two counts of possession of a firearm by a
felon, one count of possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana
and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia.

Pretty People
Florida residents hotter
than North Dakota's
L ook around, boys and girls, you're surrounded by hot-
tiesYep, the frat guy wearing a 2007 fraternity-barbecue T-
shirt with old stains and creases and that knockout, gym-infat-
uated sweetheart with a hair-tie attempting to control her frizzy
mess of a beehive are some of the hottest in the country.
This is the cream of the crop, America. Take it or leave it.
We're not kidding. TheDailyBeast.com did a "quasi-scien-
tific" study that catalogued all 50 states plus Washington, D.C.,
which won the blue ribbon for pretty people, and analyzed how
hot the people who live there are based on past Miss America
winners, the number of models who live in the state and state-
by-state fitness data.
Hawaii, California, Connecticut and our very own Florida,
with its tank top-wearing, gym-rocking bodies, rounded off the
top five hottest states.
Maybe we at the Editorial Board are missing something, but
are we really hotter than 46 states?
We're as proud of our fellow foxy Floridians as much as
the next sexy Gator, but some of us here have even been told
we don't belong in Gainesville because our ensembles are "too
New York" or are "fit for L.A."
We're sure Gainesville Fashion Week will bring out the se-
cret Alachua County hotties like a moth to a flame and remind
us why Florida truly is one of the hottest places to live.
But until then, we're relying on our sunkissed South Beach
cuties to represent the Sunshine State.
And in the meantime, we won't be planning a trip to North
Dakota, whose entire population of 38 ranked as the ugliest
state.
Sorry, Fargo.
Bump It
ollowing in the foot-steps of the rockumen-
tary "Spinal Tap" and
the mockumentary "Best In
Show," the new Web show
"Bump+" gives a faux doc-
umentary treatment to a
reality show about people
choosing whether to have
an abortion.
The kicker: Characters
will make their final deci-
sions based on real com-
ments left on the videos.
Two webisodes are on
Youtube and the show's
Web site, bumptheshow.
com, with a new release ev-
ery Monday and Thursday
for the next four weeks.
The concept is strange,
and it at first seems to be
propaganda or some sick
joke. Are these people try-
ing to create situations that
prop up a side on one ofAmerica's last remaining
deadly debates (R.I.P., Dr.
Tiller)?
Are they mocking reality
TV, ideological diehards or
both?
With a little investiga-
tion, the venture appears
to be a sincere desire to ap-
proach the deadlocked de-
bate from a novel angle.
But for now, the most
interesting part is not the
debate about abortion, but
the debate about this way
of approaching the issue.
Both abortion rights
and anti-abortion advo-
cates have denounced the
show as absurd for allow-
ing viewers to choose the
make-believe fates of pre-
tend-pregnant women.
Strange that both sides
change their tune when it
comes to real life.

Q2E3OLO y

Study abroad offers valuable experience
Last Wednesday, I stopped by the UF Study
Abroad fair outside of the Reitz Union to dis-
cover what options are open to me for getting
out of Gainesville and my pitiful dorm room.
This is not to say that I don't love the city of
Gainesville.
Its dramatic daily fluctuations in temperature, ruth-
less bicyclists, unclean pizzerias and great variety of lo-
cal -um -wildlife make it a home away from home.
I just think to truly make the best of my time here at
the university and squeeze every cent out of the rising
tuition, I need to take my studies past university walls.
You can only learn so much in a classroom setting
(even less when you are sitting in Pugh Hall's notori-
ously uncomfortable chair-desk combo).
I feel it is imperative for every college student to
study abroad at least once during their time in college,
even if it is only for a week or two.
And although they are incredibly entertaining and
informative, weekly trips to the Jersey Shore don't
count.
Yes, study abroad does cost money, but there are
plenty of scholarships, grants and free money that you
can get toward the trip.
The organizations and people offering the trips are
not going to send you over there and leave you to fend
for yourself with a passport, an atlas and an old pair of
shoes.
Plus, everyone I know who has gone on a study
abroad trip has loved it, and they have said the trip
pays for itself.
At the fair last week, I was stunned by the number
of destinations offered through UF Study Abroad. I still
have no idea where some of these trips go.Joshua Lee
letters@alligator orgI dare you to locate Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, on an unmarked
map.
The point is there are hundreds
of study abroad opportunities to
take advantage of.
According to a study abroad
presentation, only about 30 per-
cent of UF undergraduates study
abroad.
It is shocking that more people don't take advantage
of this opportunity.
Then again, maybe I am biased.
I have spent my entire life living in various countries
and know what the rest of the world has to offer us as
students and citizens around the world.
But as someone who grew up overseas and knows
what life is like beyond our shores, I really urge every-
one to jump at the chance to become a study abroad
scholar.
Even by watching those corny but fascinating Cisco
and IBM commercials, it becomes clear we are becom-
ing a more diverse, connected world.
To succeed in the future, one must think in an in-
ternational context and the only way to do so is look
past the blackboard or LCD screen and gain a global
perspective.
Instead of spending another semester in Gainesville,
choose to study abroad and have the best time of your
life.
My destination recommendation? Paris. Just for the
food. Bon voyage!

Unite Party has wrong kind of experience
Is the Unite Party really so desperate to
cling to power that they're gearing up the at-
tack machine this early? The letter from Josh
Winegar going at the Student Alliance party's
credentials is pretty laughable, especially
when you consider the constant scandal the
Unite Party gets into.
Winegar lauds experience, but the "expe-
rience" that the Unite Party has is experience
nobody wants -wasting tens of thousands
in student fees, blocking efforts to make vot-
ing records available on the Internet and never
standing up to the administration.
And then there's the "experience" of the
Unite Party's presidential candidate of push-
ing a new multimillion-dollar student fee,
which will cost most students more than a
hundred dollars per year in the middle of a gi-
ant recession.
I'm choosing the Student Alliance party.

Student Alliance party has plenty of
experience
Josh Winegar's letter in Tuesday's Alliga-
tor was very interesting. Apparently, Josh has
a different definition of experience than you
and I do.
Ben Cavataro served two terms in the Stu-
dent Senate, winning both elections by sub-
stantial margins. His legislation cut thousands
in Student Government waste and returned
that money to student organizations.
While at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill, Sagar Sane led the school's
speakers bureau and worked to establish its $2
million endowment.

which contains almost three times more posi-

the least effective budget committee since I've
been a student at UF, authoring budgets con-

Cultural events should spark discussion
The picture highlighting the "Islam Fair"
on campus was a stark reminder that although
at times what we hold in common -such as
enjoying delicious food -may bring us to-
gether, our differences keep us apart. Here we
see an attempt to bring Islam to the non-Islam-
ic world, and a photo portraying two women
with faces peeking out from behind elaborate
head wraps. While it is pleasant to enjoy the
food and other positive aspects of other cul-
tures, such as song, dance and philanthropy,
we must not forget our critical thinking skills.
Human cultural practices differ significantly,
and we must identify these differences if we
are to embrace our free will. The photo raises
several important questions we ought to ask:
Why are these women dressed this way? How
would they be treated in their culture if they
chose to dress differently? In countries where
Islamic cultural-religious practices dominate,
how are free speech and artistic issues treated?
Human rights? Are religious and cultural tol-
erance encouraged in predominately Muslim
countries?

By MARIA FARIAS
Alligator Contributor
Ed Watts showed up at Lilly Springs about 24 years
ago and found the place covered in garbage.
He met one of the owners and asked if he could clean
the spring.
"I'm a skinny dipper," Watts recalled saying to the
owner.
"No problem," the owner responded.
From then on, Watts has been the caretaker of Lilly
Springs on the Santa Fe River.
Watts is a local celebrity around North Florida and
has acquired the nicknames "Naked Ed" and "The Wild
Man of Lilly Springs."
He even has his own beer, Naked Ed's Pale Ale,
which is sold at the Great Outdoors Restaurant in High
Springs.Watts spends most of his day sitting beside a
hut he built, entertaining canoers who pass by the spring
to use the restroom he built.
Watts spent most of his childhood in a hospitalbecause he was born with a broken leg. But his brittle
bones don't stop him from caring for the spring.
"I've never been married. I never had kids. I tell peo-
ple this spring is my wife and my kids because I think I
love this spring about as much as anybody loves their
wife, their kids," Naked Ed said.

SG safety agency broadens scope, focus
SENATE, from page 1
Mastrodicasa said the issues
presented by the senators will
be brought to the attention of
the Public Safety Committee
during the meeting on Feb. 22.
Senators shared their stories
about inconsistent and outra-
geous cab fares they have been
required to pay.
"We are in the business
of making good policy,
but we often don't know
what's going on on the
street."
Jeanna Mastrodicasa
Gainesville City Commissioner
and UF Assistant Vice Presi-
dent for Student Affairs
Senators also unanimously
passed a bill changing the name
and expanding the duties of an
SG agency called Acting Against
Rape: Every Student's Taskforce
(AAREST), now called the Gator
Health and Safety Agency.
Charles said the agency pre-
viously focused on sexual as-
sault prevention but will now
deal with other safety and
health issues.
"It's essentially a name
change, broadening it more to
be able to represent the students
more effectively," she said.
Jillian Rogers, AAREST ex-ecutive director, said the agency
plans to work harder to educate
students about other health is-
sues such as nutrition, stress
management and prevention of
sexually transmitted diseases.will also act as a liaison between
health- and safety-related orga-
nizations, such as Gator Well.

Health and Safety Agency will

UF must put tough loss behind it
* GATORS FACE ALABAMA
ON THURSDAY.

As hard as they are to forget,
Billy Donovan doesn't want his
players dwelling on the contested
jumper Scotty Hopson drained or
the way Alex Tyus' last-second
shot rolled off the rim.
Florida will look to refocus in
practice before traveling to Ala-
bama on Thursday and hosting
Mississippi State on Saturday.
"Through all that, we still
had the final shot and
a very good shot to win.
Those little things do play a
part, but we still should've
won, despite everything."
Erving Walker
sophomore point guard
UF has to let go of its crush-
ing 61-60 loss to Tennessee before
moving forward.
"No one's got any control once
the ball leaves Alex's hands. No
one had any control once the ball
left Hopson's hands," Donovan
said. "But we do have control
over how we screen, how we get
back, how we defend, how we
block out.
"Those are the things we need
to try to look at, making sure our
focus is on things we have some
level of control over."UF coach Billy Donovan and the Gators will try to forget about their
tough loss to Tennessee as they prepare for their upcoming games.
That hasn't proven to be easy
for UF after such a heartbreaking
defeat.
The Gators will remember
they had a chance to win at the
end of the game against the Vol-
unteers despite shooting 25 per-cent from three-point range, com-
mitting 17 turnovers and getting
outrebounded 41-32.

Bigger is not always better when it comes to defensive tackle prospects
ust because Sharrif Floyd isthe top-rated defensive tack-
le, according to Rivals.com,
doesn't mean it is a sure thing he
will succeed in college.
At a lot of other positions, the
top-rated guy is almost always
a can't-miss type of player, but
defensive tackle has not always
been the case.
Since 2002, only five out of the
20 defensive tackles that were
given a five-star ranking have
made significant impacts. To be
fair, I won't rule out last year'sfive five-star recruits, including
UF's Gary Brown, but he defi-
nitely did not get out to a good
start by having to redshirt his
first season.
By comparison, 14 out of the
27 five-star running backs ex-
celled in college, and two of the
three from the 2009 class already
made a difference for their teams
in their first season -Alabama's
Trent Richardson and Tennes-
see's Bryce Brown.
Twelve of those five-star de-
fensive tackle prospects weighedat least 300
pounds,
which is
probably
the reason

Bobby's World pan out atboa IlIovi@a IlIigator org th colgthe college
level.
In high school, not many of-
fensive linemen are more than
250 pounds.
Heck, I was forced to play line
my senior year of high school dueto lack of talent and size. Also,
my team switched to the Wing-
T with pulling guards that lead
block most plays and because I
played fullback, I was a prime
candidate to make the switch.
I weighed 185 pounds, and
one game I had to go up against
one of the those highly recruited
300-pounders, Rivals.com's No.
12 defensive tackle prospect for
the 2006 class Kendrick Ellis -
things did not go well for me that
game.
With a huge size advantage,those big fattys can move most
high school offensive linemen
without much trouble and look
like a monster on film.
They never really have to
develop rush moves, use their
hands or, most importantly, the
ability to fight in the trenches.
And forget about learning
to stop the run. Because of their
size, it is nearly impossible to
move them without at least a
double team, and even then it's
hard to get them out of the run-

Gators show rust
in first tourney
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
It appears the Florida men's golf team needs to get
back into competitive form.
In the No. 3 Gators' first tournament of the spring
season, they came into the Arizona Invitational with the
highest ranking of the 14 teams competing. But UF's rank-
ing didn't mean anything in Tucson, Ariz., as it concluded
the 54-hole event with a fourth-place finish Tuesday.
"The one thing I can say about our team is that they
are consistent," UF coach Buddy Alexander said. "Again,
they didn't play very well based on the fact that the course
was sitting there waiting for them. There was no wind, the
greens were not firm and the scoring condi-
tions were great.",
The Gators (281-279-279, -13) finished 16
strokes behind winner California (269-274-Golf 280, -29), 15 back from Arizona (279-271-274,
-28) and only one behind Fresno State (284-
273-281, -14).
"We were in a warm weather area and we've been get-
ting as much practice as anyone," Alexander said. "There
wasn't a lot of rust but maybe a little bit of competitive
rust."
Leading the Gators was senior Tim McKenney. After
finishing Monday's first two rounds tied for 18th place
at -2, McKenney (68-72-67, -6) shot -4 in the final round
Tuesday to finish the tournament tied for seventh. In his
final 18 holes, McKenney had four birdies and no bogeys.
Freshman Tommy Mou (69-70-70, -4) finished tied for
11th competing as an individual in his first collegiate
event. Mou's final round included six birdies, one bogey
and two double bogeys. Mou birdied or better on the 2nd,
5th and 18th hole all three rounds.

ning lanes.
High school football is so easy for most
of these guys that it is a rude awakening
when they do get to college and have to go
against guys their size.
Most of them have to learn technique,
get in shape and get faster.
That takes a lot of time and often that
defensive tackle that was expected to
make an immediate impact is stuck in lim-
bo for a few years trying to develop into
a college-level defensive tackle and earn astarting job.
On the other side of the spectrum, those
players that aren't as big coming out of
high school who often get written off as
too small to play inside and to slow to play
on the edge are the ones who can emerge
as great defensive tackles in college and
then in the NFL.
Someone smaller -anything 275
pounds or less -is going to have to work
hard on almost every snap to make a dif-
ference in high school.
They don't have such a big weight ad-
vantage that they can just toss offensive
linemen around.Ihey have to rely on being quicker ott
the snap, using their hands well to beat
their blocker and toughing out their op-
ponents.
When these smaller players get to col-
lege, they usually have a lot of the tech-
niques down and are in good shape for a
defensive tackle.
All they have to do is put on some
weight, which is not a problem once they
get put on a diet plan by the team's nutri-
tionist.
With fewer things to fix when they get
to college, the smaller linemen can get onthe field quicker.
At 310 pounds, Floyd has history going
against him before he even steps on the
field for the Gators.
Florida does have a guy in its class that
is my ideal candidate for a great defensive
tackle.
Dominique Easley is the No. 2 prospect
at the position, weighs only 258 pounds
and runs a 4.7 40-yard dash.
After throwing on 20-30 pounds, which
he could do by the time he arrives at UF in
the fall, Easley's going to be a force inside
for the Gators.

shot to win," sophomore point guard Erv-
ing Walker said. "Those little things do play
a part, but we still should've won, despite
everything."
UF experienced the thrill of the last-sec-
ond victory thanks to Chandler Parsons'
buzzer-beaters against N.C. State and South
Carolina, and Donovan reminded his play-
ers at the time that they were one shot away
from the emotional low they are now fac-
ing.
Much like he tried to keep his team
grounded following the exciting wins, Don-
ovan is working to make sure UF doesn't
overreact to the loss to Tennessee.
"We can't have it both ways right now,"
Donovan said. "We can't be all down in the
dumps because we lost on a last-second play
then all of a sudden we're exuberant, exhila-
rated and jumping up and down. I don't
think that's right."
DONOVAN IN FAVOR OF TOURNA-
MENT EXPANSION: A day after reports
surfaced about the NCAA Tournament po-
tentially expanding to a 96-team field, Don-
ovan weighed in on the subject, expressinghis approval.
"I think it's always a good thing to have
more opportunities for more people," Don-
ovan said. "I felt bad for our kids the last
couple of years. You're right there a game
or two away from maybe being in and then
they don't get a chance to go."
SportsByBrooks.com initially reported
the expansion as being a "done deal," ac-
cording to ESPN and an administrator of an
NCAA school, but NCAA
senior vice president Greg
Shaheen told FOXSports.
com that no decisions haveMen's been made, adding, "Noth-Basketball ing is a done deal."
The NCAA could opt
out of its 11-year, $6 billion contract with
CBS after this season, and doing so would
create the possibility of a new broadcaster
carrying the expanded tournament.
"I always think that it's better to include
more. That's just been me," Donovan said.
"How all that works and how much longer
is the tournament and how many weeks
they've got to add -I don't know all that.
But I think every college coach would be the
same way."McCumber finished 18 over par

Senior Tyson Alexander and ju-
nior Andres Echavarria both tied

UF freshman Marissa King is transitioning to college gymnastics after spending the
previous two years competing in international competition for Great Britain.King adjusti
U SHE IS RANKED IN THE NATION'S
TOP 20 IN THE ALL-AROUND.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
A lot of the attention early in this season
has been on freshman Ashan6e Dickerson,
but another young gymnast has started
to make a name for herself for the No. 3
Gators.
Freshman Marissa King is coming off
her best all-around performance of the sea-
son, scoring a 39.2 against LSU last week.
Even though she has excelled early on,
she is still adjusting to collegiate gymnas-
tics.
Before enrolling at UF this semester,
King was an Olympian for Great Britain at
the 2008 Beijing Games and also competed
at the 2009 World Championships in Octo-
ber.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said the ongo-
ing transition King is making to college-
level gymnastics is a challenge.
Faehn added the gymnasts don't show
much emotion and are focused on the skills
at the elite level, compared to now having
to learn how to perform for the crowd and
judges.
"I'm getting used to it, slowly but sure-
ly," King said. "The more competitions you
do, the more confident you get and more
experience you gain in the college-side of
gymnastics."
Against LSU, King showed off her abil-
ity to work the judges and feed off the largeng to college
crowd, as she scored a 9.85 on the floor, an
event where high-energy routines can earn
a gymnast a better score.
Faehn said King has also learned to show
the emotion that international competition
lacks as well as how to love the sport and
enjoy doing it.
After Friday's meet, Faehn said King
told her it was the most fun she had in her
entire life.
Not only is she having fun, but King
has shown a definite improvement and has
become more aggressive in her routines as
the season has progressed, according to
Faehn.
The college atmosphere has helped the
freshman adjust to the NCAA competi-
tion.
She compared the home crowd against
LSU to the audience she competed in front
of at the 2009 World Championships in
London.
That support, combined with the bond
she has made with her teammates, has
translated nicely for the freshman so far
this season.
Despite the challenge of the transition,
King is currently ranked among the top-
20 all-around gymnasts in the nation this
year, with an average of 39.125 -good for
19th.
Faehn, however, knows King is just be-
ginning to scratch the surface.
"I've said this a few times, but she has
the potential to be a great all-around gym-
nast," Faehn said. "She just has this un-
tapped potential, but has to learn how to
harness her power."
