A public discussion will be held in Peabody Hall today 
about an offensive poster that’s drawing attention across 
campus.
The poster, supposedly from Happy Fortune Buffet, of-
fered up to $50 in exchange for unwanted dogs. The restau-
rant and phone number accompanying the offer are fake, 
but Asian-American students say the racism is real.
The discussion will be held in Room P411 at 12:50 p.m. 
Alexander Cena, director of the Asian Paciﬁ  c Islander American Affairs, will lead the forum.
Cena said he began tearing down the posters after stu-
dents brought them to his attention. He turned in ﬁ  ve post-ers to UFPD, ﬁ  led a formal complaint and contacted UF’s Ofﬁ  ce of Student Affairs. The posters have been spotted 
at Little Hall, Turlington Plaza, Weimer Hall and Carleton 
Auditorium.

After an inmate’s girlfriend 
started stripping during a visi-
tation video and he hit jail staff 
for trying to detain him, deputies 
handed out additional charges.
Deputies charged 23-year-old 
Tyrone Bernard Johnson with battery on detention staff, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 7:45 p.m., a detention 
deputy removed Johnson from a video visitation with his girl-friend because she started taking her clothes off on camera, which 
violates jail policy, according to 
the report.
When a deputy tried to put Johnson in 
handcuffs, he 
spun around 
and slapped him, causing the deputy’s glasses to fall off. 
Johnson then 
pushed him in 
the chest, and the deputy’s badge fell off, according to the report. The deputy had to put Johnson 
in a bear hug to gain control of 
him.
During questioning, John-
son said he did not intentionally strike the deputy, according to 
the report.
 He has a $50,000 bond for the 
battery charge.Johnson has been at the jail 
since August 2013. 
His charges include aggravat-
ed assault with a deadly weapon; 
ﬁ  ring a weapon in public; ﬁ  ring a missile in a dwelling vehicle, building or aircraft; and posses-
sion of a weapon or ammo by a 
convicted felon, according to jail records. Inmate’s girlfriend strips on video, then he slaps a deputy� THEFT RISES THIS TIME OF YEAR.

As Gators prepare to head out for Spring 
Break, Florida safety ofﬁ  cials are offering tips 
to UF students.
Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce Sgt. Re-
becca Butscher said there is an increase in off-
campus theft in Gainesville during this time of 
the year.The fact that college spring breaks are heav-
ily advertised gives thieves the perfect oppor-
tunity to steal, she said.
“It’s no secret where students primarily 
live, and unfortunately, the criminal element 
will take advantage of that,” Butscher said.
Criminals look for an easy target, so stu-
dents should make sure they lock their win-dows and doors and close their blinds before leaving for Spring Break, she said.
After locking up their belongings, driving 
safely while traveling to Spring-Break destina-tions is students’ next concern.Florida Highway Patrol public affairs of-
ﬁ  cer Lt. Jeff Frost said distracted or impaired 
driving and speeding are all major concerns 
for FHP at this time of year because of the in-creased likelihood of crashes.
“We do try to get the message out to, es-
pecially during Spring Break, not to drink and drive,” Frost said.
It’s important for student drivers to limit 
driving distractions, such as cellphones, music and other passengers, Frost said.
During the next week, as students enjoy a 
vacation period that stereotypically involves alcohol, many ofﬁ  cials agree that drinking re-sponsibly is a major issue.
GatorWell Health Promotion Services 
specialist Joi Alexander said students should never accept a drink from an open container or leave their drink unattended.
“Treat your drink like your purse,” she 
said.
Alexander said she realizes that drinking is 
often the center or purpose of activities among college students.

When Rachel Benjamin received 
an email last year that there was a 
package for her at the Broward Hall front desk, she expected a small de-livery.
Instead, she found 15 boxes of her 
favorite Girl Scout Cookies tightly se-cured in bubble wrap.
“I could deal with this,” the 20-
year-old UF biochemistry sophomore said.  
With the 97th Girl Scout cookie 
season well underway, UF students will do anything to get a hold of 
their favorite cookies. Fortunately for 
Gainesville residents like Benjamin, cookie booth sales begin in town to-day.
Mary Anne Jacobs, CEO of the 
local Girl Scouts council, said booth sales typically last about three weeks, depending on each troop’s schedule.
Cookie lovers can ﬁ  nd nearby 
sales with the revamped Girl Scout Cookie Finder app, which allows us-ers to locate the closest booth by en-tering their zip code.
In Gainesville, booth locations in-
clude the West Gate Publix, 125 SW 34th St., and the Haile Plantation Publix, 2755 SW 91st St. 
Julie Hill, a UF graduate student 
and leader of Troop 1688, said with the ﬁ  rst weekend of cookie booth sales coinciding with the start of UF’s Spring Break, students usually buy the $4 boxes of cookies on their way out of town.
Benjamin said she has about a box 
and a half of Lemonades left from the 
four her parents brought last week 
when they came up from South Flori-da for her birthday. Although she said she’s hoping there will be more wait-ing when she goes home for break, she might grab a box on the way.
“I love them,” she said. “No one 
will turn down a Girl Scout cookie.”Girl Scout Cookies on sale  CAMPUS

The Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid now recog-
nizes same-sex marriages from states that allow them, and Gainesville residents are react-
ing to the change.
The FAFSA website says the 
move to recognize legal same-
sex marriages is based on the Supreme Court’s decision last year that found a section of the Defense of Marriage Act uncon-stitutional.
This policy change affects 
students and their parents who may see a smaller amount of federal aid awarded to them next year now that both paren-tal incomes must be reported  rather than just one.
LB Hannahs, the director 
of UF’s LGBT Affairs, said the changes are both a sign of prog-
ress and somewhat unfair to 
students who will lose aid. 
“There’s still an imbalance in terms of what rights are afford-ed to LGBT people because of the difference between the fed-eral and state laws,” Hannahs said. “So is it a sign of progress? Yes, but it’s complicated.”
Hannahs said the recogni-
tion of same-sex marriage on a federal level will continue to be complicated until all states have 
legal same-sex marriage, which 
Florida does not. But the change is still a step toward equality.
“It puts you at an equal 
playing ﬁ  eld with folks from opposite-sex parents,” Han-nahs said.
Besides equality and fairness 
under the federal law, Hannahs believes the new change has to do with money as well.
Lieb Wexler, a 20-year-old 
UF biological engineering ju-nior, has lived with his mothers since they met 10 years ago. Al-
though Wexler’s moms are not 
legally married, he said they plan to marry one day, and they wear wedding bands to sym-bolize their commitment.
The change will not affect 
Wexler directly, but he said he could relate to students whom it will affect.
“The treatment of same-sex 
couples under the new rule would seem just if it wasn’t for the fact that same-sex marriages are not treated fairly under all respects of the law,” he said.  
UF’s Ofﬁ  ce for Student Fi-
nancial Affairs said in a state-ment it does not yet know the 
repercussions the change in 
policy will have on awards.FAFSA recognizes more couples

UF biological engineering juniorhave to drink to have a good time for 
Spring Break,” she said.
Maj. Brad Barber of University Police 
said he thinks that underage alcohol con-sumption is the biggest issue for college 
students during Spring Break.
“Students know underage drinking 
is against the law,” Barber said. “This is 
about recognizing what may happen as a result of that.”
Barber said it’s also important for vaca-
tioners to be aware of crime in the area that they’re visiting.
Besides the issue of alcohol use, Barber 
said securing one’s valuables is necessary.
Alexander advised that while vacation-ing, students should follow basic safety 
tips that are often forgotten such as carry-
ing an ID at all times.
Students should also notify friends and 
family of their whereabouts.
UPD officer Greg Castronover said he 
agreed that underage drinking is a major concern.
“Know your limits,” he said. “Try not to 
do anything that you wouldn’t do in front 
of your parents.”
However, students like Justin Lewis, a 
19-year-old UF sports management fresh-
man, said the reaction of officials for Spring Break may be overblown.
“It’s just like an ordinary night out in 
Gainesville,” he said. “People may think it’s crazy, but it’s really not.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2014

A UF student is recovering from minor 
injuries after a Regional Transit System bus 
hit her Thursday evening near the Hub.
Melanie Cabezas, a 21-year-old UF 
chemical engineering senior, was walk-ing on a crosswalk texting when the Route 38 bus struck her. The accident injured 
Cabezas’ knee, but she refused medical 
attention, said RTS spokesman Chip Skin-ner.
University Police issued the bus driver 
a citation for the accident, but as of press time, the department couldn’t say what the citation was for, said UPD Sgt. Seth Col-sum.
Buses hit pedestrians about one or two 
times per year, “which is a good thing considering that we’re moving 10 million people every year,” Skinner said. 
“It’s rare that anybody is struck by our 
buses,” he said.
Cabezas declined to give further details, 
but she did give advice to pedestrians.
“All I got to say is you better live life 
to the fullest, ‘cause you never know when you’re gonna get hit by a bus,” she said.

ALEX HARRIS

A journalism class Thurs-
day afternoon achieved brief 
Internet stardom.
During a guest panel of 
former students on Thursday afternoon, #JOU3109 was a trending topic nationwide.
“For just those few mo-
ments in time, we were ahead of Mardi Gras and Pokemon,” said Julie Dodd, the multime-dia writing professor.
Dodd required her class of 
roughly 90 students to tweet at least twice during the panel discussion on how to do well in upper-level journalism 
classes. Her goal, she said, 
was to teach them how to live-tweet and record the high-lights of the conversation.
A student noticed the 
hashtag was trending and quickly snapped a screenshot, a move that Dodd called “an 
expert thing to be thinking 
about.”
Dodd requires her class to 
learn how to live-tweet as part of her beginning journalism class’s curriculum because she believes social media has become an integral part of journalism.
She said that when tweet-
ing became part of the cur-riculum two years ago, very 
few students had a Twitter 
account. But now, “almost ev-erybody has one,” she said.
Gabrielle Beecher, a 19-
year-old UF journalism fresh-man, was live-tweeting along-side her classmates during the panel conversation.
She called the occasion 
“super rad” and said it drove home Dodd’s lessons about using Twitter.
“It really underlines how 
powerful social media can be,” she said. “We’ve joined the Twitter ranks of #royalba-by and #weloveyoujustinbie-ber.”Journalism class

Striving for that perfect sun-
kissed glow this Spring Break could 
be harmful.
The number of skin cancer cases 
due to indoor tanning is higher than 
the number of lung cancer cases due 
to smoking, according to a study published by JAMA Dermatology.While college students flock to-
ward the ultraviolet radiation emit-
ted by these tanning beds, skin can-
cer rates may be growing.
UF assistant professor of derma-
tology Michael Wangia said he has noticed an increase in skin cancer cases over the last five years.
“It’s not unusual seeing a 19- or 
20-year-old with skin cancer come in to our clinic,” Wangia said.
Indoor tanning leads to informal 
aging and an increased risk of skin malignancies, Wangia said. The saf-est alternative to indoor tanning is spray tanning.
“I think by and large, the most 
important thing is really to have a level of sun protection,” Wangia said.But as Spring Break approaches, 
more college students turn to indoor 
tanning.
Dustin Perkins, manager of Hot 
Spot Tanning Spa, said the salon 
receives about double the business around this time of the year.
“(People) are just trying to look 
good before they go out of town on their vacation,” Perkins, 25, said. “They’re all going places and don’t 
want to burn when they do go to the 
beach.”
In the U.S., 419,254 cases of skin cancer can be attributed to indoor tanning, according to the study. 
Out of this number, 6,199 are case of 
melanoma, the most deadly kind of skin cancer.
Evelyn de la Vega, a 20-year-old 
UF public relations senior, said the multitude of regulations placed on indoor tanning show how unsafe the practice is.
“I don’t think that it’s worth it,” 
de la Vega said. “I’d rather be pale and weird looking than have to deal with skin cancer.”Indoor tanning linked to higher cancer rates than smoking

Cena posted on the APIA Facebook 
page stating he received anonymous 
emails apologizing for the poster at 
about 9:30 p.m. Thursday.
He said he hopes to speak with the 
students responsible so he can change their viewpoints about Asian Americans and help prevent other similar incidents.
Andrew Sun, a 21-year-old UF po-
litical science senior and first-generation 
Chinese American, said he first saw the 
posters while he walked out of class on Wednesday. The mock advertisements were taped to Turlington Plaza’s cement tables.
“It’s just a shocking thing to see,” Sun said. “It’s really confusing to me, and I’m 
really disappointed at whoever did it 
and thought it was OK.”
Sun, who is also an ambassador for 
UF’s APIA, said the ad was posted to In-stagram by students who thought it was funny.
“I don’t understand why anyone 
would waste their time thinking it’s fun-ny,” he said.
Anna Shao, a 19-year-old UF bio-
chemistry sophomore, said she couldn’t believe something so offensive could be posted at a university known for its di-versity and acceptance of minorities. 
Shao said the jab hit especially hard 
because her parents run a Chinese res-taurant in Jacksonville.

College students are getting 
ﬁ  t, tan and now ﬁ  nancially re-
sponsible to prepare for their Spring-Break getaways.
More than two-thirds of stu-
dents don’t rely on parents to ﬁ  -nance their excursions and save to fund their own vacations, ac-cording to a CheapTickets.com survey of about 500 students, released Tuesday.
Students who pay their own 
way enjoy a unique sense of freedom, said company spokes-
woman Marita Thomas.
“When you pay for some-
thing yourself, the decision is 
then yours about where you go and where you stay,” Thomas said. “That’s part of being adult.”
Heather Gibson, a professor 
in UF’s Department of Tour-ism, Recreation and Sport Man-agement, said timing may be a factor when students choose to pay.
“You may only have four 
Spring Breaks to choose from through your college career, so at least one of them should be 
something fun,” she said.

“Normally we have a list of people that have sung before,” said Aaron Seitz, a market-ing intern for the University Athletic Associa-
tion. “This gives us a chance to ﬁ  nd people who have great voices and give them the chance to sing in front of a large audience.”
A panel from the UAA selected the three 
videos after receiving multiple online submis-sions. The winner will be chosen based on an evaluation from the panel and the number of likes each video receives on the gymnastics team’s Facebook page by Sunday.
Jessica Grace Jones, a 24-year-old UF alum-
na, Alissa Kontranza, a 20-year-old UF journal-ism junior, and The Phabulous Phlegmtones, a barbershop quartet from the Barbergator Cho-
rus, will compete for the chance to perform.
Mike Roth, 62, who sang tenor in the Phleg-
mtones’ video, said he was impressed by the 
other two videos and was excited for “an ex-cuse to sing with a fun group of guys.”
“Both gals are really great. I have to ap-
plaud them to do it solo,” said Roth. “The big difference is style. I just love the barbershop harmonies we do.”Singing Gators compete to perform national anthem at meet

 Darts & Laurels 
Gainesville residents have been steaming over the city’s 
newly instated biomass plant, which could be a factor in residents’ steadily climbing utility bills. Gainesville Re-
gional Utilities has quietly been raising its rates — ﬁ  rst in 
October and then in December. The higher rates are associ-ated with GRU’s increased projected annual contract cost with the biomass plant. The cost was originally projected 
to be $102.4 million, but GRU gave a presentation at the 
City Commission’s Oct. 17 meeting stating the adjusted cost would be $104 million. 
But in our Tuesday story about the jump in students’ 
January utility bills, representatives said the reason for the 
hike was the cold weather. They said the high frequency of 
freezing temps caused students to use their heat more. 
While this is most likely true, they didn’t attribute any 
of the changes to the biomass plant and its impact on resi-
dents’ utilities cost — and that’s shady as hell. This week, 
we’re throwing a DART at GRU for dodging the truth: 
This biomass plant is costly, and residents are ticked off. 
This week, the Reitz Union and Fresh Food Company 
made major strides in realizing the university’s goal of 
zero-waste by 2015. The Reitz and Fresh Food Company 
signed a contract that involves a plan to start composting some of the 2,000 pounds of food waste produced each day by the dining halls. So this week, we’re handing off a LAU-
REL to the Reitz and Fresh Food Company for their com-
mitment to reducing campus waste. 
During the past few days, students have been tweeting 
and Instragramming photos of racist ﬂ  iers spotted around campus. The ﬂ  iers depict a photo of a dog along with a 
poorly written mock ad for a restaurant called “Happy For-
tune Buffet.”
Ugh. Really? How many times do we have to remind rac-
ist morons that it’s 2014 and this kind of unfunny bulls**t 
doesn’t ﬂ  y anymore? 
Stupid “jokes” such as this one are not only bottom-
of-the-barrel-scraping attempts at humor, but they’re of-
fensive and target an already marginalized group of peo-ple. UF morons get an are-you-efﬁ  ng-serious DART this 
week. 
On a brighter note, UF was recently ranked within the 
top 20 universities with the most alumni currently in Con-gress — UF has 12 alumni congressional representatives, 
and FSU has four. This next LAUREL goes out to all the po-
litical Gators doin’ work and makin’ bills — congressional 
bills, that is. So when you’re in Cancun drinking Coronas on the beach with all the other college students, you have something to brag about in between keg stands. 
Happy Spring Break, Gators. And don’t forget: If you’re going to drink, STAY AWAY 
FROM BALCONIES. 
Seriously.‘Religious freedom’ bill ignites controversy
The land home to the Grand Canyon brought a slew 
of controversy this week when reactionary legislators passed a religious freedom bill. The bill is an amend-
ment that rides on the shoulders of an act that began after Native American Church members were ﬁ  red for using psychedelic cacti more than a decade ago. It enshrines Ari-zona citizens’ rights to religious freedom by declaring that anything done or not done because of a “sincerely held” re-ligious belief  is well and good, so long as it doesn’t conﬂ  ict with government interests. 
At ﬁ  rst glance, this sounds cool: Supporters paint a picture 
of an Arizona where this bill helps ensure that everybody’s rights are safe and nothing bad will happen to anyone ever. 
The problem is that this isn’t true. SB1062 was created 
in response to cases in other states where people have been sued for refusing service to same-sex weddings and commit-ment ceremonies. Arizona decided to make sure that never happened. It was written and passed by a few legislators with the intent of allowing owners of businesses like baker-ies, restaurants, hotels and photography studios to discrimi-nate against gay potential customers in the name of religion. Its passage has, understandably, generated a ton of outrage. Although it seems some supporters of the bill do so out of genuine desire for religious freedom, the words and actions of too many others make clear how this bill will be used. 
State Sen. Al Melvin, in a tiff with Anderson Cooper, all 
but conﬁ  rmed SB1062’s purpose of legalizing discrimination by dodging Cooper’s questions. He harkened to “pillars of society” that he said are under attack as justiﬁ  cation for the bill. 
Luckily for those who support equal rights, Arizona Gov. 
Jan Brewer vetoed the bill on Wednesday. 
She did that for a number of reasons. Outrage had Ari-
zona citizens and businesses protesting — a pizza parlor put up a sign that said “We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona Legislators,” that was soon copied across the state. Many Arizonans were upset about the negative publicity this brought their state, and they felt like they were repeating the experience of the controversial and very strict immigration bill passed there in 2010. There were economic pressures too — Arizo-na is slated to host the Super Bowl in 2015. 
The NFL strongly pushed for 
Brewer to overturn the bill and considered moving the game somewhere else if that didn’t happen. Apple Inc., which is going to open a factory in the state, also called for the veto. Several Arizona politicians, including Sen. John McCain, op-posed SB1062. Even legislators who originally voted for the bill changed their minds and asked the governor for a veto.  It was a victory for LGBT rights in this country — but a nar-row one. 
This debate reﬂ  ects a paradox of American politics: State 
governments have more direct inﬂ  uence on their constitu-ents than the federal government, but historically use that inﬂ  uence to disenfranchise entire swaths of the population.  It’s a shame because the states are arguably more effective at passing legislation and can act as a check against the more ri-diculous federal policies — see any article ever written about federal reactions to marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. Sadly, the states most often use this power to do things like keep people they don’t like from voting. 
But luckily, that same structure makes state governments 
easily accessible, compared to Washington. It’s a smaller land area, smaller constituency, and — let’s not be naive — money buys power. State elections are cheaper than national ones. Extreme factions of both parties have, are and, in all likeli-hood, will take advantage of and hijack state legislatures. But then again, so can sane, responsible representatives.

She was 19, smart, silly and beautiful. 
In the autopsy, her blood alcohol level 
was .408.
Her name was Molly Ammon, and she was 
my roommate. 
She and her friends were drinking in Ma-
deira Beach on the last Saturday of Spring 
Break. She was inebriated, so her friends did what college students do: They put her to bed to sleep it off. Except this time — the morning of March 13, 2011 — she never woke up.
Molly’s friends didn’t call for help when 
she was stumbling and slurring. They didn’t think anything worse than a rough hangover 
would result. I can’t blame them. College stu-
dents think they’re invincible. I know I used to think so.
I’m not here to tell you not to drink. I’m not 
going to preach about the dangers of underage drinking. I’m telling you not to be stupid.Here’s something not ev-
ery UF student knows: UF an-nounced a Medical Amnesty Policy in April 2011. The policy protects students from disciplin-
ary action if they seek help for themselves or 
a friend who is having a medical emergency involving alcohol or drugs.
Think about it. If you call 911, what’s the 
worst thing that could happen? Your friend will have his stomach pumped? He’ll have a hefty emergency-room bill, so he’ll be mad at you for a few days? 
Who the hell cares? Let him be mad at 
you.
Blame it on me.Molly had a crazy laugh unlike anything 
I’d ever heard. It was honest and contagious. The last time I heard it was March 4, 2011, the Friday before Spring Break. I walked into our dorm room on the fourth ﬂ  oor of Jennings Hall, and I climbed the ladder to her bunk where she was still sleeping. I bounced on the bed, woke her up and told 
her about my night. We gossiped and laughed like freshmen girls do; I said goodbye, and I left for Spring Break. I am so glad I woke her up that morning. 
We used to go to the pool next to Broward 
Hall. We used to go to Midtown. We used to go to Boston Market by the Oaks Mall. One time, we went to a John Mayer concert in Tam-pa, where she was from. That’s when I fell in 
love with her family.
No mother should have to bury her child. 
Molly’s mom, Angie, travels and tells her story 
to young people. She’s the strongest woman I know.
Molly’s older sister, Katie, has to live every day without her only sister. 
Her father, Bob, wakes up knowing his 
baby girl lost her life way too early.
It didn’t have to happen. You’d think it 
would go without saying, but I can’t count the 
number of times I’ve seen the typical 2 a.m. 
Gainesville scene: wasted college students stumbling around Midtown, incoherent, while their friends laugh it off and drag their drunk friends home.
Don’t laugh. It’s not funny. Laughing is 
the dumbest thing anyone could possibly do when a friend can’t stand up or speak. 
My idea of Spring Break will never be the 
same. 
Make sure you remember yours for all the 
right reasons.

Last Tuesday, a column ran in 
the Alligator titled “Viral vid-eo is one-sided” by UF student 
Eric Brown, in which he discussed Nicolás Maduro, Hugo Chávez and 
Venezuela. After reading it, I real-
ized some things he said were partially true and some partially false.
Brown claimed that Chávez in 2012 and Ma-
duro in 2013 were democratically elected by the people. While Chávez’s election was decided by the majority of the Venezuelan citizens, Maduro was not elected democratically.
When the Consejo Nacional Electoral an-
nounced the results of the election between Maduro and Capriles, the result margins were extremely close. Capriles demanded a recount of the vote. The CNE recounted the votes in an unconstitutional way, but Maduro remained Venezuela’s illegitimate president.
Brown also stated that Chávez and Ma-
duro’s government has accomplished “near-elimination of extreme poverty since 2002 and 
increased access to doctors and education.” The 
ﬁ  rst statement is false, but the second is true.
The Misión Ribas taught illiterate people in 
the slums all over the country to read and write, and the Misión Barrio Adentro gave free health care to the poor. Both were huge social success-es for the government.
However, since Maduro’s illegitimate elec-
tion less than a year ago, the Venezuelan econo-
my has plummeted. Hunger, sickness, inﬂ  ation 
and insecurity don’t differentiate between a so-cialist and a capitalist, a chavista or a caprilista or if you voted for Maduro or Capriles.Finally, to claim that “the press 
isn’t free or that Maduro wins elec-tions through propaganda don’t add up” is false. Maduro had ac-cess to the government’s resources 
such as radio, TV, newspapers and 
public funds to run his campaign. Also, state 
employees were pressured to vote for Chávez for fear of losing their jobs if they didn’t.
Since Maduro became president, the state 
hasn’t released the money for private newspa-pers to buy paper. In Venezuela, private com-panies buy dollars from the government to buy paper. Of nine national basic TV networks, 
the government directly or indirectly controls 
seven. The other two networks are a sports network and a religious network. Venezuela’s biggest national radio network is also owned by the government.
The Venezuelan opposition’s biggest prob-
lem was failure to take its opponent seriously. Chávez managed to represent the poor people after they had been ignored for about 50 years, 
and their support helped him get elected and re-
elected. Claiming that all of Chávez’s decisions had negative impacts tells only half the story.
Since Chavez died, Maduro hasn’t been able 
to keep the country economically stable. He has censored the media and failed to provide food and medicine in addition to ordering violence against protesters for the past two weeks.
Chávez beneﬁ  ted and harmed Venezuela. 
Whether he did one more than the other is for you to decide.

Speaking OutMarion
Martorell
Speaking Out Eric Brown’s guest 
column demon-strated hypocrisy in 
two ways: Its title and its content emphasized why 
the viral video explaining 
today’s situation in Venezuela is one-sided. He then went on to emphasize the few improvements the Venezuelan government has accomplished while completely disregarding the country’s signiﬁ  cant increase in murders, scarcity in basic day-to-day needs, tyrant rule over peaceful protests and censorship 
of the media.
Venezuela’s murder rate in 1999, 
before Hugo Chavez’s presidency, was 
25 per 100,000 people. By 2011, it rose to 45.1 per 100,000, ranking it the fourth most-dangerous country in the world.
Furthermore, supermarkets country-
wide lack basic staples such as ﬂ  our, sugar, milk, toothpaste, napkins and 
even toilet paper. But Brown refused 
to acknowledge this while emphasiz-ing the government’s achievements in eradicating poverty.
Brown then attempted to defend 
people’s arguments as to the media cen-soring by stating that most newspapers are anti-Chavez. In a democracy, re-gardless of a news station’s bias — and 
I think we can all agree they are obvious 
throughout American news outlets — they are allowed freedom of the press, they are still able to communicate news as well as opinions, like you so proudly did in this newspaper. The media in Venezuela is being completely censored and TV channels are being shut down daily. The fact that they have a known bias is not a reason for the gov-ernment to censor them.
It is beyond my un-
derstanding why the Alligator would publish something of this sort. It is your duty as a newspaper to inform, and the publishing of this article does ev-erything but that. With a quick Google search, you can see the enormous global efforts that Venezuelans have made to raise awareness of the horriﬁ  c situation 
the country currently faces. 
Venezuelans are risking their lives 
in search of peace and a democracy. Be-
cause not everyone has the opportunity to be there, those not in Venezuela are doing their best to attract worldwide attention to this matter. The Alligator chose to publish an opinion stating the “one-sidedness” of a video  when the 
purpose was nothing beyond a plea 
for global awareness. Venezuelans are asking for the basic rights and freedom they lack, which can be taken for grant-ed when they are constantly present.
Venezuela is at a halt right now, but 
this writer believes these protests are useless and uncalled for. The Alligator has completely disregarded the global 
effort of Venezuelans, and by allowing 
this opinion to be published, it is omit-ting very crucial information and allow-ing those who are unaware form opin-ions based on incomplete information.

Orange and blue were the new 
black Thursday night when Piper 
Kerman, the author of the book that inspired the Netﬂ  ix series, spoke in Gainesville.
Kerman talked about the lack 
of justice in the criminal justice system for frank,  a three-day gathering that aims to solve some of the biggest problems facing so-ciety.
UF students and top social 
change communicators from around the country spent the last 
two days at the Hippodrome State 
Theatre working toward that goal. 
“We wanted to bring those 
social change communicators to-gether to help them share the best of what they know and strengthen our ﬁ  eld,” said UF professor Ann Christiano, who helped organize the event.
Kerman’s book follows that 
philosophy, as she reﬂ  ects on her 
time in prison to explore the “ex-
treme injustice and inequality” for prisoners and make those issues more accessible to readers.
“The best public interest com-
munications efforts are funda-mentally narrative,” Kerman said. “Human beings are hardwired to be interested in stories ﬁ  rst.”
UF’s College of Journalism and 
Communication is hosting frank at the Hippodrome to honor the life and legacy of its namesake, UF alumnus Frank Karel.
Karel spent his life pioneering the ﬁ  eld of public interest commu-nications, inspiring a loyal group of followers through his ground-breaking use of communication to drive positive social change.
Christiano worked with Karel 
before he died in 2009.
“What Frank Karel was as a 
person, we aspire to be as a ﬁ  eld,” she said.
In 2007, a fund endowed a pro-
fessorship to ensure that someone could continue Frank’s work.
Christiano was chosen as the 
inaugural Frank Karel Chair in Public Interest Communications, 
making her the world’s ﬁ  rst and 
only endowed chair in that ﬁ  eld.
She said frank is one of the 
ways she is using her position to shape the ﬁ  eld and share Karel’s story.

Following a growing trend 
of using crowdsourcing web-
sites for funding, a local bar has asked Gainesville to help raise money to keep its doors 
open. 
The Midnight, located 
at 223 S. Main St., started a 
Fundly.com campaign about a month ago. According to the website, the bar surpassed its goal of $1,800 with the help of 41 supporters.
“I literally have cried at 
certain points out of happi-ness and out of feeling so appreciated and loved,” said Beverley Webb, owner of The Midnight.
Webb opened the bar in 
June 2010. At the time, she didn’t understand business matters such as taxes, licenses 
and renewals, she said.
“I guess I didn’t realize just 
how much there was to know 
about that stuff and how in-credibly important that stuff is,” she said.
Other Gainesville busi-
nesses have found themselves in binds like Webb’s.
Blake Briand, co-owner of 
The JAM, said donating to The Midnight was a “no-brainer.” 
The story stood out to him 
because he found himself in a similar situation, so his bar and concert venue launched an Indiegogo campaign in August.
“We raised a similar 
amount of money, and it was what we needed at the time,” 
he said. “It helped us out a 
lot.”Crowdfunding websites 
are a “hot, sexy topic right now,” said UF entrepreneur-
ship professor Michael Mor-
ris.
Use of the websites could 
help businesses that are in trouble and need to overcome ﬁ  nancial issues, he said, but businesses should not solely rely on these websites because the funding doesn’t provide a 
sustainable source of income.
“Most of the crowdfunding 
is about launching something 
or helping that thing grow, not dealing with something that is in a crisis mode that is about to go out of business,” 
Morris said.
Crowdfunding is differ-
ent from traditional funding 
because donors don’t receive a percentage of ownership of the company they’re donating to, he said. To maximize ef-fectiveness, Morris said busi-ness owners should be honest 
about the reasons they’re ask-
ing for money.
For bars with a strong, local 
presence like The Midnight, using funding websites can be a workable method, he said.
“(If) you have some place 
that’s beloved and that has a sizable following, then yes, 
there is a viable way,” he 
said.The Midnight latest

With Arkansas’ 71-67 win against Kentucky on Thursday, Florida clinched the Southeastern Conference regular-season title. With the title, the Gators will be the No. 1 seed in the SEC Tournament.Kelsey Stewart and the UF softball team begin five-game tournament today. Read the story on page 16.� BONDS SCORED 11 
POINTS IN FIRST HALF.
GORDON STREISAND
Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
With a mighty No. 17 Tex-
as A&M squad looming on 
the horizon, Florida needed a win at Vanderbilt to have a better chance of earning a 
ticket to the NCAA tourna-
ment.
In a tight 73-68 victory in 
Nashville, Tenn., the Gators’ wish was granted. 
“If you would have told 
me that we would’ve gotten a lead and kept it the whole game,” coach Amanda But-
ler said, “and played with 
the level of composure in the face of the runs and some of the things that didn’t go your way —  Kayla (Lewis)’s fouls, 
that sort of thing — I’d say, ‘Wow, that sounds great! But that sounds a little improb-able.’”
In the first half, the Gators 
exploded offensively.
About 10 minutes in, Flori-
da jumped out to a 23-6 lead. 
Led by senior Jaterra 
Bonds’ 11 points and six as-sists, Florida shot 56.3 per-
cent from the field and took a 
12-point lead into halftime. 
“I felt like our post players

In somewhat of a rare sight, 
the Gators were not only lead-ing in the paint, but dominat-ing it, outscoring Vanderbilt 
26-8 in that domain. 
“It’s always an emphasis 
for us,” Butler said. “Rarely 
do we match up evenly, size-wise, with people inside. We try to generate those touches by drives and some good in-terior passing. I thought we

Pitching and defense are the 
keys to any good ballclub.
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
they only had one of those impor-
tant attributes on Thursday. 
No. 25 Florida (5-4) committed 
four errors — two of which led to 
unearned runs — in its 2-1 tourna-
ment-opening loss to Florida Gulf Coast (6-3) at McKethan Stadium.
“It was uncharacteristic and re-
ally frustrating,” catcher Braden 
Mattson said. “The errors and a lit-
tle laziness after the errors — you boot a ball, that’s alright, but you can’t let it snowball.”
The first error seemed innocu-
ous enough. FGCU shortstop Alex Diaz hit a ground ball to UF fresh-man Peter Alonso at third base. Alonso held up his end of the bar-
gain, making a solid toss to first. 
But freshman A.J. Puk dropped the throw, allowing Diaz to reach safely.
Two pitches later, shortstop 
Jake Noll, who came into the game with a .387 batting average, laced 
a double down the left-field line to 
score Diaz. 
Despite the error, Gators start-
ing pitcher Logan Shore retained 
his composure. The freshman 
right-hander locked down the Ea-gles for most of the night.
Making his second career start, 
the Coon Rapids, Minn., native had the best outing of any Florida pitcher this season. Shore tossed six innings without giving up an earned run while striking out sev-
en batters — a season-high for UF 
hurlers. 
“He had two bad pitches, I 
thought,” Mattson said. “Some 
unfortunate errors in the field that

During the latter half of South-
eastern Conference play, ankle 
soreness and tendinitis in both knees have made Casey Prather a little more hesitant to slash. But 
on Tuesday night, the senior for-
ward attacked the rim often. 
Unfortunately for Prather, 
Vanderbilt had his number. 
While he recorded a game-
high four steals and six rebounds during the No. 1 Gators’ 57-54 win against the Commodores in Memorial Gym in Nashville, 
Tenn., Prather went 1 of 5 from 
the field for only two points — easily his worst offensive perfor-mance this year. He also commit-ted three turnovers in 30 minutes of action.
“I’m just more concerned 
about him in terms of him letting the game come to him,” coach Bil-ly Donovan said. “He’s trying to create things that are not there.”
Donovan believes Prather did 
not do a good job of utilizing his teammates and spreading the floor when the opportunities to score in the paint were not pres-
ent.“He’s driving in there and real-
ly with nowhere to go,” Donovan 
said. “I thought in the first half, 
he had opportunities to dump the 
ball off to Patric (Young) and Will Yeguete and some other players 
along the base-line, and they’re not letting him get to the rim. 
“This is one 
of those games 
where, you 
know, you’ve 
got to do other things. Almost 
become a passer a little bit. Drive it, create help, get guys some shots. I don’t know what he did [Tuesday night]. He had three assists, but the way Vandy was 
playing him, he could have had a 
lot more if he would have distrib-uted a little better.”
The ailing senior forward, 
who began the season relatively healthy and on a double-digit scoring streak of 14 games be-fore missing two games with a 
bone bruise in his right knee, has 
scored just nine points on 4-of-15 shooting in his past two games. 
Gators missing Hill: Florida 
(26-2, 15-0 SEC) announced that point guard Kasey Hill has been cleared to play against LSU (17-10, 8-7 SEC) on Saturday at 4 
p.m. 
Without Hill (groin), the Gators 
have not been the same team. 
As Hill has missed UF’s past 
three games — wins that have all 
come by a close margin — Scot-tie Wilbekin has not had many chances to take a breather. 
The senior point guard has 
rested only nine minutes in Hill’s absence, and Florida recorded only two assists against four turn-overs during that span without a natural point guard on the floor. 
The increased responsibility 
has put a burden on Wilbekin, who has made just 36.1 percent of his field-goal attempts in his past 
three contests.
UF’s offense hasn’t nearly been 
as efficient without Hill creating 
open looks for his teammates, and the team has shot just 41.7 percent in its past three contests compared to a 46.1 percent clip in SEC play prior to the his injury.
“We need Kasey Hill  to get 
back healthy,” Donovan said. “I’ve got [Wilbekin] out there too

“He had two bad pitches, 
I thought. Some unfortunate 
errors in the field that led 
to the runs, but he pitched

really put the score on him.”

UF catchermuch. He’s such a warrior. He’ll 
say to me, ‘I don’t want to come out, coach. … No, I’m ﬁ  ne, No, I’m ﬁ  ne.’ But at some point when you’re playing that many minutes 
and you’re pressing, it’s going to 
affect your offense a little bit.”
Walker emerging: Sophomore 
guard DeVon Walker has been feeling it lately from downtown. The 6-foot-6 Winter Haven na-
tive has been a reliable three-point shooter for the Gators during his 
past ﬁ  ve games, hitting 8 of his 14 
attempts from behind the arc and averaging ﬁ  ve points per contest during that span. 
During UF’s ﬁ  rst 23 games, 
Walker, whose primary role for UF was as a lockdown perimeter 
defender before emerging into 
a viable threat from three, had amassed only 51 points on an 8-of-35 clip from three. 
He made an impact in Flori-
da’s win against Vanderbilt on Tuesday, scoring six points on two made three-point shots in 19 minutes on the court. 
Walker’s most important 
three — an open look from the right wing — lifted the Gators to 
a 53-45 lead with 5:40 remaining 
against the Commodores.
led to the runs, but he pitched 
really well, so you can’t really put the score on him.”
He allowed six hits, but it 
was the two runners who got on via error who caused the damage.
“It’s frustrating, but it’s a 
part of the game,” Shore said. “Players are going to boot balls. It’s going to happen, and I just did my best to try to 
limit the damage.”
The defense’s struggles 
hurt Florida again in the ﬁ  fth 
inning.
FGCU center ﬁ  elder Gage 
Morey singled to lead off the inning, and UF center ﬁ  elder Buddy Reed gave him a gift, bobbling the ball in center and 
allowing Morey to reach sec-
ond base.
After a sacriﬁ  ce bunt by 
Diaz moved him to third, 
Morey scored on a single by 
Noll.
While multiple players 
struggled in the ﬁ  eld, short-stop Richie Martin had the 
toughest night.
The sophomore committed 
two errors during the game — his fourth and ﬁ  fth this 
season. Martin’s performance dropped his ﬁ  elding percent-age from .930 to .896. 
Martin, however, caught a lucky break — neither of his errors led to the Eagles tack-ing on any runs.
“Balls going underneath 
his glove,” O’Sullivan said. 
Although two runs is not 
an impossible deﬁ  cit, the Gators struggled to capitalize any time they had runners on.
Florida racked up nine hits 
on Thursday but struggled to get a rally going. The Gators went a measly 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position.
“Nine hits, but none of 
them were strung together in any kind of way that led to runs,” Mattson said. 
The Gators eventually got 
on the board in the bottom of the eighth, but even then, they showed the inability to drive in runs. Before UF scored the 
run, Florida had players on 
second and third with no outs for junior Taylor Gushue — UF’s most proliﬁ  c power hit-
ter. If the Gators were going 
to win the game, this was the opportunity to do it.
After working a 3-0 count, 
Gushue struck out. 
The Gators tacked on one 
run in the inning, but the chance for a rally evaporated, taking the wind out of Flor-
ida’s sails and ending its last 
real chance for a win.
“Got to put the ball in play, 
simple as that,” O’Sullivan said.14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2014

The second-ranked UF track and ﬁ  eld 
team started its run to a Southeastern Con-
ference Championship Indoor title on the ﬁ  rst day of the three-day meet.
On Day 1 of competition in College Sta-
tion, Texas, two Gators got their team start-ed to a smooth start with Lorraine Graham and Brittany Harrell competing in the pen-tathlon.
Harrell and Graham guided Florida to 
a third-place ﬁ  nish through Day 1, earning the Gators ﬁ  ve points.
UF sits in third place — behind ﬁ  rst-day 
leader Georgia, which has 15 points,  and Mississippi State, which has accrued 10.
To highlight the women’s team day, Har-
rell claimed ﬁ  rst place in the Pent women’s 800m run with a time of 2:16.23.
With that mark, Harrell eclipsed her ca-
reer-best 800m run to close out opening day 
competition with a new school record. 
Harrell would ﬁ  nish fourth overall in the 
pentathlon standings racking up ﬁ  ve points 
for the Gators, and placing the women’s team in third place to start the SECs. Coach Mike Holloway said the team was 
extremely proud of Harrell as she came out and displayed a lot of pride and passion to break a school record and ﬁ  nish fourth. 
After suffering a knee injury and under-
going surgery last year, Harrell progressed her way to the SEC Indoors this season and topped her 4,118 points from 2012 nation-
als to 4,137 points to com-
mence SECs. 
To add to her record-
breaking performance,  
she notched a personal-best record in 
the long jump (6.04m) to ﬁ  nish in second place. 
The junior has now ﬁ  nished fourth in 
the pentathlon twice in her collegiate career at SEC Indoors. 
Accompanying Harrell during the open-
ing day of competition was Graham, who matched a career-high in the high jump with a 1.60-meter jump. 
Graham coasted to a third-place ﬁ  nish in 
the women’s 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.53 seconds, which is the third-fastest for the Gators in its indoor season. 
The senior marked her ﬁ  rst time com-
peting this season in the 60m hurdle, high jump, shot put and 800m, which also was her ﬁ  rst pentathlon of the year.
The Gators will return to action in Day 2 
of the 2014 SEC Indoors as the men’s team will get in the mix with ﬁ  eld and running events. Runner sets career-high mark in ﬁ  rst day of SEC Championships

The Gators were disappointed after going 
scoreless against the Cardinal on Sunday, but 
their journey doesn’t get any easier with an-other top-10 squad on the schedule tonight.
No. 5 Florida (8-2) will play to No. 9 Texas 
A&M (6-2) at 5 p.m. as part of USTA’s nation-ally televised College MatchDay series. 
Both the Gators and Aggies ﬁ  nd them-
selves in similar situations a year after ﬁ  nish-ing in a three-team tie for the Southeastern Conference title. 
Texas A&M and Florida both lost All-
American players at the No. 1 position after the Aggies’ Cristina Sanchez-Quintanar and 
the Gators’ Lauren Embree ﬁ  nished their se-
nior seasons. Both teams have also added three freshmen to their roster.
After splitting last year’s season series 1-1 
in TAMU’s ﬁ  rst year in the SEC, a rivalry may be in the works between the two conference foes.
“They lost a player at one that was world 
class. We did too, so we feel the same sort of 
pain,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
“They beat us last year as a ﬁ  rst year SEC 
team and that’s hard to do … I’m sure they’re rocking into Gainesville hoping and thinking that they’re going to beat us.” 
Both teams will also experience their ﬁ  rst 
SEC match play of the season a year after both 
ﬁ  nished 12-1 in conference play. 
“Texas A&M is really good,” Thornqvist 
said. “They have players at certain spots that can give us trouble. We need to make sure that we’re hungry, and OK upstairs to compete.”
Today will be the Gators’ ﬁ  rst match since 
being blanked by then-No. 3 Stanford on Sun-day. Against the Cardinal, freshman Belinda Woolcock was the only Gator to win one set in a singles match.
The defeat rose questions regarding lead-
ership on a mostly inexperienced team that is still developing chemistry. Florida hopes its second straight match against a top-10 oppo-nent will provide some answers.
“I think this team has to learn to really 
hold true to the blueprint they put together of 
what kind of team we want to be,” Thornqvist 
said.
“We need to not only play, but act like a 
championship team at every instance when 
we compete.
“I’m hoping that [Sunday]’s loss is going 
to motivate us and make us even better, espe-
cially for [today].”FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Svete, Peoples make clutch three-point plays to preserve win
block presence tonight with Kayla and Ronni (Williams) 
that made some huge plays on the backside.”
Vanderbilt senior Christina Foggie kept the Commo-
dores in striking distance throughout the ﬁ  rst half, scoring 17 points thanks to a 4 for 6 effort from three-point range.
With the score 42-30 entering the second half, the Gators 
began to wane.
After shooting 18 for 32 in the ﬁ  rst half, Florida went 1 
for 13 to start the second half, and Vanderbilt narrowed the gap to four points in that span. But a big three pointer from sophomore 
January Miller ended the drought. An en-suing layup from Bonds put the Gators up by nine, 52-43.
The Commodores then stormed back 
to get within three, but another clutch three — this time from senior Lily Svete 
— put the Gators up by six with a hair 
over seven minutes remaining. 
But, as the previous course of the game 
had dictated, Vanderbilt again pulled to within three with four minutes remaining.
 Florida again followed with another crucial three-point-er from redshirt sophomore Cassie Peoples. 
The Commodores were again within three points with 
under a minute left, but critical free throws from Peoples and fellow redshirt sophomore Carlie Needles sealed the deal for Florida. 
“Carlie’s just one of those players that wants to be in 
the game at that moment and hopes she’s the one who gets 
fouled,” Butler said.
With the win, the Gators sealed their fate to ﬁ  nish at 
least .500 in conference play and in the top half of the SEC. 
“Monumental task in trying to match up with Texas 
A&M on Sunday,” Butler said, “but thank goodness this 
team embraces monumental challenges.”W-HOOPS , from page 13

Kelsey Stewart is leading 
Florida in more ways than one.
The sophomore second base-
man paces the Gators with seven 
stolen bases, 21 runs scored and 
22 hits. Stewart is also tied with 
junior Lauren Haeger with a team-leading 18 RBIs.
Despite the high marks 
through Florida’s ﬁ  rst 16 games, Stewart and No. 1 Florida are not letting their success get the best of them as they prepare for the start of the Diamond 9 Citrus Classic. Florida plays No. 4 Ore-gon today at 3:30 p.m. in the ﬁ  rst of its ﬁ  ve games in Orlando.
Florida will then play a dou-
bleheader against Fordham and Ohio State on Saturday and con-clude its time at the tournament with contests against Maryland and Radford on Sunday. 
“This weekend’s going to be 
a good test for us,” coach Tim Walton said. “From here on out, everything is getting tougher as we go.”
The Gators (16-0) will be fac-
ing their toughest opponent of the season so far when they face the Ducks (14-1).
Six of Oregon’s players who 
have at have taken at least 30 at-bats this season boast a mini-mum batting average of .333. 
Senior shortstop Courtney 
Ceo leads the Ducks with a .543 clip at the plate, which is the sec-ond-highest mark in the Pac-12.
“We’re just taking things one 
game at a time,” Stewart said. “So our record from last week-end doesn’t really matter to us. It’s this weekend. Our next game 
is Oregon, so we’re focused on 
that game.”
As Florida’s leadoff hitter, Stewart will try to build momen-tum for the team early, hoping to get on base with a quick hit and 
then steal a base to get into scor-
ing position.
“It’s just me trying to get my 
team going, and if I don’t get it the ﬁ  rst time, I have the second at-bat, the third at-bat,” Stewart said. 
“So really it’s just conﬁ  dence 
in my team being behind me the 
whole time.”
The Wichita, Kan., native, 
who classiﬁ  es herself as a power 
slapper, has been working on improving her soft game and feels she has made strides since the start of the season.
“I got a couple chops down, 
so I was pretty proud of myself. I think it’s getting a lot better,” she said. “I need to step up my bunting. It’s not really working 
out for me right now, but besides 
that, I think I’m coming along good.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2014

For the ﬁ  rst time this season, Florida will 
travel to Alabama, but if the Gators continue 
to succeed, tonight’s outing likely will not be the last.
No. 3 Florida (7-0, 5-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) takes on No. 4 Alabama (7-3, 5-1 SEC) in Tuscaloosa, Ala., at 8:30 p.m. 
Florida will return to Alabama — Bir-
mingham not Tuscaloosa — for the SEC Championship in March and possibly the NCAA Championship in April. 
But coach Rhonda Faehn said her team is 
treating this road meet like any other. 
“This is a regular season dual meet and 
we treat it as such,” Faehn said. “I really feel this is going to be an excellent opportunity for our team heading into our eighth meet of the year, getting near the end of our regular season, to really start to gel with our lineups, the position of our lineups and really getting to look for getting those 
landings and having a sol-
id road competition.”
With only three meets left in the regular 
season, Faehn said she’s ready to debut a 
postseason lineup.
“For the most part, I think it’s as close as 
we are to having the lineups,” Faehn said. “We still have one more day of training so we can kind of see from there and make sure it’s solid.” Included in tonight’s lineup and Florida’s 
postseason lineup is senior Alaina Johnson. Johnson competed all-around in Florida’s last three meets and she’s competed on vault, uneven bars and balance beam in all of UF’s 2014 meets. 
“She’s a senior with great experience 
and is a great leader out there on the ﬂ  oor as well,” Faehn said. “So we will be looking 
to her to be a very solid all around contribu-
tor.”
The only freshman included in that line-
up will be Claire Boyce. 
The Texas native has competed on bal-
ance beam and ﬂ  oor at all of UF’s meets this season. 
While Boyce puts up solid scores in the 
9.80 range on ﬂ  oor, she’s shown even more talent with multiple 9.90s on beam.
“It’s all about being consistent in prac-
tice,” Boyce said. “If you’re consistent in practice then you’re going to perform how you practice so I just work on being conﬁ  -dent and trying to hit days on beam with no wobbles.”
Faehn recognized the tough challenge 
posed by competing in Alabama’s Coleman 
Coliseum — especially for the more inexpe-
rienced gymnasts. 
“The majority of the competitors in our 
lineup have been put under pressure situ-ations like we’ll encounter Friday,” Faehn said. “It’ll be a little bit newer of course for our freshman who haven’t been a part of that just yet and I think it’s going to be ex-citing.”
