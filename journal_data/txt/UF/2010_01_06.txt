BREAKING NEWS
Crash downs
power lines,
blocks traffic
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Pedestrians helped out after one driver hit two cars,
knocked down a power line and flipped his SUV on its side
at Northwest 15th Street and Northwest Fifth Avenue at
about 4:40 p.m. Tuesday.
The driver, heading east on Northwest Fifth Avenue,
sped through the intersection at Northwest 15th Street, clip-
ping a smaller car as he drove past, said Gainesville Police
Department officer Bryon Carroll.
The SUV swerved after the collision, hitting an unoccu-
pied blue SUV parked along the south side of Northwest
Fifth Avenue, Carroll said.
The driver lost control of the car and hit a nearby electric
pole, breaking the pole and knocking it into the middle of
the street and flipping the SUV onto its side, Carroll said.
Neighbors and passers-by rushed to help the driver, who
escaped through his front window, Carroll said.
"The pedestrians did a great job providing help to a
stranger," he said.
Traffic was blocked temporarily, but no one was seri-
ously injured.

Christmas came a week early for the
Alachua County Wellness Works pro-
gram when it received a state award for
its creativity in addressing health issues.
The Florida State Surgeon General
Health Innovation, Prevention and Man-
agement Award was given to the pro-
gram Dec. 18 by Florida State Surgeon
General Dr. Ana M. Viamonte Ros.
"It was a great honor for us to receive
recognition from the state, and I think
it's great that the state is starting to put
health awareness into the spotlight," saidMatt Tripp / Alligator Staft

Intruder kills woman
-POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING
THE DELAY IN RESPONSE.

A 20-year-old woman was shot
and killed while visiting a friend's
apartment when two armed intruders
forced their way into the home Mon-
day night.
At about 9:30 p.m., Stacey Brown
was visiting Mannuel Shaw, 21, in his
apartment at 5811 NW 23rd Terrace in
Pine Ridge when the attackers broke
in, according to Gainesville Police De-
partment Capt. Ed Books.
Shaw threatened the invaders with
an unloaded gun.
One of the intruders fired two shots
from a handgun before escaping, ac-
cording to Books.
One of those shots was fatal, hittingBrown.
Police are investigating a delay be-
tween their arrival and Brown's shoot-
ing, Books said.
Shaw, a convicted felon, was ar-
rested for possession of a firearm. He
admitted to having retrieved it from
his father's car, Books said.
Although descrip-
tions of the suspects
varied too greatly for
any good leads, GPD
is investigating.
The Gainesville
Police Department
Shaw is asking Gainesville
residents to be on the
lookout for a 1990s-model white Hon-
da connected with the suspects.

Locals react to president's
appointment of transgender,,-.1, !).,0,ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
Amanda Simpson is a former military test
pilot, holds degrees in physics, engineering
and business administration and is a newly
appointed senior technical adviser for the
U.S. Department of Commerce.
She is also the first transgender presiden-
tial appointment in American history.
"Being the first sucks," Simpson told ABC
News in an interview. "I'd rather not be the
first, but. I think that I'm experienced and
very well qualified to deal with anything
that might show up."
In her new role, she will help with licens-
ing and exports of U.S. military tectmology.
Once known as Mitchell Simpson, she
began her six-year transition from male to
female in 2000. In 2004, she won the Demo-
cratic nomination to the Arizona House of
Representatives before losing in the general
election.
According to AC Stokes, director of
LGBT Affairs at UF, Simpson's story serves
as a momentous occasion for the visibility
of transgender people in the U.S. and will
hopefully give more transgender people the
courage to be themselves.

New Years' dieters urged to lose weight
UF official advises mindful eating rather than dieting
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Newfound New Year's dieters might find
a little extra inspiration to put down the Ding
Dongs and speed up the treadmill this week
hidden within two lesser known weeklong
holidays.
Diet Resolution Week, Jan. 1 to Jan. 7, and
National Lose Weight/Feel Great Week, Jan. 1
to Jan. 8, both help to launch newly established
diet and exercise plans for the seemingly most
popular New Year's resolution, the same reso-
lution which, for many, never survives to seeGroundhog Day: getting in shape.
A 2005 Weight Watcher's study conduct-
ed by Harris Interactive found 45 percent of
women resolved to lose weight in 2006. Of
that 45 percent, almost 100 percent said they
thought they would need some assistance to
keep that resolution.
But some health professionals warn against
the mass fixation on crash dieting.
"Diets don't work," said Janis Mena, reg-
istered dietician with UF's GatorWell Health
Promotion Services. "They create more prob-
lems than they help."
Mena elaborated, saying many fad diets,such as the Atkins Diet, restrict certain food
groups like carbohydrates that are essential to
proper nutrition.
"Traditionally, when people go on a diet,
they go off a diet," Mena said.
Instead, Mena advised, dieters should fo-
cus more on mindful eating and exercising
rather than simply cutting calories or eliminat-
ing certain foods.
But according to a February 2009 Huffing-
ton Post article, cutting calories is "the only
diet that works."
The article cited a study conducted in part
by Harvard School of Public Health, whichthe right way
encouraged 811 obese participants to cut their
daily caloric intake by 750 calories.
The study found an average weight loss of
nine pounds after only six months.
Mena offered slightly different advice for
those who found themselves with a New
Year's resolution to shed a few pounds.
"It sounds so simple, but eating until you're
full and stopping when you are," she said.
"Whether it's broccoli or M&M's, put it down
and come back to it when you're hungry."
In the end, Mena said she doesn't like to
use scales as a dieting tool; they encourage an
abnormal fixation on weight instead of mind-
ful eating, she said.
"Let your clothes be the judge," Mena said,
"not the scale."
Student Senate honors students, outlines spring agenda
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Student Senators created some
New Year's resolutions of their
own during Tuesday night's Sen-
ate meeting.
Student Body President Jordan
Johnson stopped by and spoke
with senators about upcoming is-
sues for 2010.
Johnson discussed the recent
changes to Bright Futures policy,
the possible debut of textbook
rental pro-
Student grams and theGovernment question of
mandatory stu-
dent health insurance as major
items on the Student Senate to-do
list.
"This semester is ultimately
going to be determined by the job
we're going to do up in Tallahas-
see," Johnson said.
Johnson said the Student Sen-
ate will discuss a bill coming
forth in the State Legislature that
would decide whether Florida
colleges should mandate health
insurance for students.

Johnson said the obviousdownside would be the addi- ing extra protection in case of ac-
tional expense for students, but cident or illness.
students would benefit from hav- "It's a tough conversation, andthere's definitely two sides to the
story," he told the Senate. "There
always is."
Earlier in the meeting, Orange
and Blue Party Sen. Jonathan Os-
sip said he plans on discussing
the Reitz Union fee in next week's
meeting.
Ossip said the Orange and
Blue Party plans on presenting a
resolution at next week's meeting
that advocates putting a question
about the fee on the spring elec-
tion ballot.
He said the question would
have two parts: It would ask stu-
dents if there should be a fee and
if the fee should cover expansion
as well as renovations.
"We really just want to give
students as much of a choice in
this matter as possible," Ossip
said.
The discussion took a more
somber turn as Senators remem-
bered students who died during
the fall 2009 semester, including
Daniel J. Arena, Samantha Grosse
and Erin Pelton.
Senators unanimously passed
a resolution honoring the stu-
dents and offering condolences
to their families and friends.
School of Music receives
tune-up with new pianos
0 THE SCHOOL PURCHASED 61
PIANOS FOR $1.23M.
By NICOLE LYNN GREINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The University of Florida School of
Music is fine-tuning its program with
the addition of 61 Steinway & Sons
pianos, making it the largest owner of
Steinway & Sons pianos in Florida.
Andy Howard, spokesman for the
College of Fine Arts, said the pianos
cost $1.23 million and will replace the
old pianos dating back to the 1950s and
1960s.
Most of the new pianos were deliv-
ered Dec. 21. to the UF School of Music,
Howard said.
Howard said they were purchasedwith the help of donations and through
a loan from UF, which will be repaid
by the music department over seven
years.
In order to help pay for the loan, stu-
dents will be charged equipment fees
for classes that use the
pianos, according to
Howard.
Joanna Gardner, a
music education soph-
omore, expressed her
excitement about the
recent purchases.
Howard "To some it may
seem like an insignifi-
cant detail to have newer instruments
-especially pianos -but in my opin-
ion, pianos are an essential tool for all
of the music students and professors,"
Gardner said.Thomas Plevik/ Alligator Staff

SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
UF ranked among
best school values
By JENNIFER BATE
Alligator Writer
UF was ranked No. 2 by Kip-
linger's Personal Finance as one of
America's 100 Best Values in Public
Colleges.
It ranked behind the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando
was not surprised by the rankings,
noting that UF has placed second to
UNC Chapel Hill for several years.
"What is very interesting though
is that our tuition, even with the in-
crease, is still lower than UNC and
the national average," said Orlando.
"It really speaks volumes to the kindof value that our students are getting
for the tuition they are paying."
The Kiplinger rankings are based
on a combination of academics and
affordability, according to its Web
site.
UF is required to use the money
from the tuition increase to hire ad-
ditional faculty, which allows the
university to increase the quality of
education, said Orlando.
Other Florida schools that made
the cut were No. 12 New College of
Florida, No. 17 Florida State Univer-
sity, and No. 36 University of Cen-
tral Florida, according to the site.

Information courtesy of kiplinger.comStudy shows students' crimes
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
As students start a new semester, a recent
study recommends they take note of their new
classmates -one of them might have a criminal
record.
A nationwide study by MyBackground-
Check.com, a private supplier of background
checks, found that about one out of every 29 col-
lege students has or once had an adult criminal
record.
The study looked at 13,859 students in 125
universities across the country.
Driving violations represented the highest
percentage of crimes, making up 60 percent of
the total, according to a press release.
Other violations, such as theft, drug posses-
sion and sexual abuse, each made up less than 10
percent of the crimes, according to the release.
The release stated that the study only includ-
ed criminal convictions and excluded dismissed
charges and juvenile records. It did not distin-
guish between crimes committed before or after
the student started college.
Robert Mather, CEO of MyBackgoundCheck.
com, offered advice for students in light of the
results of the study.
"This high number is an indicator that edu-
cators, roommates and students should be edu-
cated about who they are living with and who is
in the classroom," Mather said.
Mather also criticized some universities fornot conducting background checks on incoming
students.
Pat Herring, the UF director of admissions,
said UF does not require a background check for
prospective students.
On the UT application, students must answer
a conduct question asking if they have been ar-
rested or charged with a crime, Herring said.
If they answer yes, the Department of Admis-
sions sends a referral to the Dean of Students of-
fice, which decides future actions on a case-by-
case basis, Herring said.
"We don't have the authority to investigate
a criminal background check, and we don't do
many referrals," Herring said.
Herring was critical of the
study and questioned the re-National sults.News "In my experience -that's
20 years working at UF -that
number is circumspect," Herring said.
Jaclyn Irwin, a UF sophomore, was not sur-
prised by the results of the study.
"You hear all the time about driving viola-
tions, even on campus," Irwin said.
She said she agrees with UF's policy on back-
ground checks and that the decision to perform
the check should be based on the type of crime.
But Mather said the levels of concern regard-
ing each crime vary.
"A student could be arrested for jaywalking
and most people wouldn't be concerned, but we
encourage people to discuss it."

Gender Bender
Americans should not be
shocked by appointment
o say that living as a transgender American is difficult is
probably an understatement. But with the national spot-
light beaming down on you (not to mention press camera
lights), it just plain "sucks," according to Amanda Simpson.
She would know.
Simpson is the first openly transgender presidential appoin-
tee, and yesterday she began her job working at the U.S. Com-
merce Department.
This appointment has brought the attention of national me-
dia as Simpson was inundated by cameras and reporters on her
first day.
It's not the spotlight that bothers her most, though. The me-
dia has jumped on the notion that this is a political appointment
designed to appease Obama's liberal base; his track record with
the gay community has been lackluster thus far.
Simpson says that she was hired on her merits rather than
for some kind of political positioning.
As expected, the source of the arguments that Simpson's
appointment was purely political is Christian-right groups like
Focus on the Family.
A spokeswoman for the group further argues that the ap-
pointment undermines "the most basic organization of social
systems" -gender -and that it asks society to "radically re-
order" the ways that we make "reasonable and rational accom-
modation for the two genders."
Unwarranted attacks and prejudice aside, the fact that this
appointment has attracted so much attention means that maybe
Americans really do need to "radically reorder" the way they
think about gender.
Because if a person can't go to work without cameras, ques-
tions and criticism simply because of an issue of gender, then
we are sorely lacking any kind of "rational accommodation."
Dr. DummyR member the Octo-
mom?
Since there's prob-
ably not a soul out there for-
tunate enough to be puzzled
by this question, we think
it's better to celebrate her re-
emergence in the news with
something more fitting. How
about.
Remember the Octomom.
Because just like the Ala-
mo, this is a battle we lost,
and one that we desperately
need to remember. What was
the battle you ask?
This time around, the
tabloid-fueled media blitz
revolves around her defense
of the fertility doctor who
helped her conceive 14 chil-
dren. According to the Asso-
ciated Press, Octomom (aka
Nadya Suleman) save an in-
terview to an online tabloid
stating that the doctor did
"absolutely nothing wrong."
We disagree. Herein lies
the battle: balancing the right
to personal privacy with
medical safety(and sanity).
No one should dictatewhat women (or anyone for
that matter) can do with their
bodies, especially when it
comes to reproductive issues.
But few would argue that
this procedure or its result is
safe or healthy. or sane. It
endangered the mother and
the children will surely find it
difficult to lead a normal life.
Fortunately, The Califor-
nia Medical Board agrees
with us. It has accused the
doctor, Michael Kamrava, of
gross negligence. Emphasis
on gross.
He transferred too many
embryos (as she already had
six kids, one was probably
too many), used fresh em-
bryos when frozen ones were
available, and most impor-
tantly he failed to refer her for
a mental health evaluation.
Aggressively pursuing
doctors who ignore medical
guidelines may be the only
way to prevent these absurd
procedures while protecting
the rights of mothers.
Either way, remember the
Octomom.

Last decade produced culture of fear
L ast decade was not a fun decade in which to growup.
I'm certainly in that group. When the decade be-
gan, I was 11, so the entirety of my adolescence and the
first few years of my numerical adulthood took place over
the past ten years.
But that decade's most worrisome effects will be felt
by those actually born during the 2000s. Simply put, they
have had the misfortune of not only growing up during
a decade that saw a culture of fear flourish, but having
never known an alternative.
If you were born in the 2000s, the specter of 9/11 has
never not been a part of your life. The images of a plane
slamming into the World Trade Center -terrifying, hor-
rible and mesmerizing in the worst possible way when I
first watched it on CNN in middle school -have been re-
played, reproduced and recreated so many times over the
past decade that they now comprise a sort of emotional
clip art for fear and confused apprehension.
If you were born in the 2000s, you've never not had
the Department of Homeland Security inform you of how
frightened you should be via a color-coded scale. The
Homeland Security Advisory System has been argued
over and mocked so much since its inception in 2002 that
it almost seems gratuitous to point out how flawed it is.
But normalizing the idea that we should constantly be,
at minimum, on a yellow "elevated" level of awareness
has the effect of normalizing a constant elevated level of
fear, something underscored by the fact that there is likely
no circumstance under which anyone at Homeland Secu-
rity would ever allow the scale to dip to blue ("general
risk") or green ("low risk"), and that the public has no real,
substantive instructions on what to do when it goes from
yellow to orange. Whether by design or by poor execution,
the five-tiered system is in reality a three-tiered scale of
"be scared," "be scareder," or "be scaredest."
If you were born in the 2000s, the United States hasnever not been at war. That's ab-
solutely true in a literal sense. The
war in Afghanistan has been going
on since 2001, the war in Iraq since
2003, and since then, we have never
not had service members taking part
Joe Dellosa in major combat operations. And
letters@alligatororg there's not an end in sight. While
President Obama has said that a
drawing down of troops should take
place in July 2011, Richard Engel of NBC News obtained
a Pentagon report describing the gross unreadiness of the
Afghan National Army, saying that it "cannot take a year
to fix this problem."
But more strikingly, the United States has perpetually
been in a "war on terror" -a phrase that essentially sug-
gests a war on a tactic, akin to declaring a "war on naval
combat" or a "war on guerilla fighting." In that sense, it's
a meaningless phrase that works well as a marketing slo-
gan but either oversimplifies and obscures real issues or
damns us into endless war.
I can think of two general reactions to a culture of fear.
The first is a constant state of panic. That's certainly dan-
gerous. Panicked people make bad decisions, often to
assuage short-term agitation at the expense of long-term
principles.
But the more dangerous reaction is a collective numb-
ing, and it's all the more worrisome when the numbing
happens among kids: the idea that fear is normal, that war
is not a big deal, that service members dying overseas is
nothing but a brief news update, that the displaced and
killed civilians in foreign lands are not just collateral dam-
age but completely acceptable damage.
I think this is more or less apolitical: The last decade
was awful.
We owe those kids a better ten years.

how health care is provided and consumed in
America and each of whom impact the cost of
that care.
Maness and others might be interested to
know that physicians' services account for
only 21 percent of U.S. health costs, and a
primary driver of reimbursement rates is de-
termined by whatever Medicare agrees to pay
for a certain level of care. Enough vitriol ex-
ists in debating American health care reform
without the need for baseless attacks.

This is in response to Kenneth Maness' let-

to the serious debate about American health

because it helps both them and the company over-
all," she said. "It's become a cost-saving method."
On-site health screenings are provided for condi-
tions including skin cancer and hearing tests, Eisen-
son said.
The program also offers a variety of classes for
employees and their families, including yoga and
strength-training classes.
Employees can choose to attend the classes dur-
ing their breaks, allowing them to exercise during
the workday.
"It's meant to fit into their workday, not add toor take away from it," she said.
While classes are used more by employees and
their spouses than their children, she said the orga-
nization is considering developing programs geared
toward helping children prepare for their futures
and develop good habits while they are young.
Eisenson, who is the only full-time staff member
of the wellness program, said the organization is
continually trying to develop and improve its ser-
vices.
"We're a very young program, but we want to
reach as many employees and families as possible,"
she said. "We're constantly planning for the fu-

Mormon relives first
mission experiences
Editor's note: This is the second
installment in a four-part series.
For the first part of the series,
please see Alligator.org.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
As friends and relatives made
their way to James Tate's house, he
couldn't help but reminisce about
the world he was to leave behind.
Wherever he was going, his family
and friends couldn't follow.
Tate was about to open a letter
that would dictate where he would
spend the next two years of his life
as a Mormon missionary.
With 30 to 40 family members
and friends looking on, he took
hold of the envelope, his hands
vibrantly shaking with anxiety.
As he took out the contents, his
curious eyes betrayed the formal-
ity of the event, reading the first
few lines. With a deep breath, he
announced the contents to those
gathered:
"You have been called to serve
in the Jacksonville, Fla., Missio-"
he got out before a storm of ap-
plause and cheers broke the solem-
nity. As tears of joy sprinkled from
his family, he read on.
"You are to report to the Mis-
sionary Training Center in three
we-"
"What?" his mother, choking
back gasps of exasperation, yelled.
"Oh, I meant months, three
months," an embarrassed Tate
clarified. All the wind in the room
was pushed out by sighing releas-
es of air.
"Oh, thank goodness," said his
mom, clutching her chest in relief.
"Don't scare me like that."
About a year before Tate opened
his mailbox to find his "call,"
Marques Schroeder stood in virtu-
ally the same position, roughly 540
miles away in Ogden, Utah, when
he was called to the same training
center.
Schroeder didn't see what the
big deal was. Why were there all
the tears? He was just doing what
any good Mormon would do. He'd
onlybe gone for two years; it would
be like an extended vacation -a
really long, holy vacation.
"I don't really get too emotion-
al. I guess there's something wrong
with me," said Schroeder, who let
a fleeting smile escape from his
generally humble demeanor. "I
knew it was coming, so there was
no reason to get all worked up
about it."
For the Schroeder family, this
was something greater. Had it not
been for the Mormon missionaries
who had brought his parents to the
church when they were teenagers,
this day wouldn't have happened.
As the oldest of five brothers, itwould be up to him to provide the
moral compass and set the exam-
ple. He would be called to give the
same kind of love and effort that
the missionaries had shown his
parents more than 25 years ago.
He was ready.
The Many Faces of Faith
While the rest sleep at the Mis-
sionary Training Center, Tate
creeps through the hall, holding a
can of shaving cream. With a trail
of repressed laughter following
from behind, he carefully tiptoes
toward his next target's room, an
impending casualty of teenage
male humor.
"I was so nervous, I almost
spewed my lunch all over
the seat."
James Tate
Mormon missionary
Although this type of behavior
won't be looked upon highly by
church supervisors, it helps to al-
leviate the sting of homesickness.
That final day at the airport had
been incredibly difficult, as wails
of sorrow from relatives young
and old echoed down the terminal
as he boarded his flight to Provo,
Utah, bound for the Missionary
Training Center.
"I was so nervous, I almost
spewed my lunch all over the
seat," he said.
Located on the foot of moun-
tainous landscape, the MTC serves
as a Mormon missionary boot
camp. For anywhere from three to
12 weeks, young Mormon men and
women from all across the world
come to learn the ways of the mis-
sionary. There, church officials
and ex-missionaries instruct the
rookies on what to expect, as well
as effective teaching techniques to
incorporate when they go out into
the world. If the trainees are to be
sent to a foreign country, they must
endure an intensive crash-course
in the native language, which can
be an exhausting process.
Softly shaking the can of shav-
ing cream so as to not let the rat-
tle thwart his plan, he unleashes
squirts of white foam, turning the
sleeping missionary into a clown-
ish caricature. This prank is so
much better than the time he used
a bullhorn at six in the morning to
wake up fellow missionaries.
The victim, feeling the foamy
mass on his face, jolts out of his
slumber, knowing that he has
fallen prey to comedic levity. He
knows the perpetrator before the
lights come on.
"Tate!"
Looking back, Tate cannot help
but burst into laughter.
"I'm such a jerk," he said, shak-
ing his head.

UF struggles
to find three-
point stroke
* FLORIDA WAS 2 OF 23 FROM THREE-
POINT RANGE AGAINST N.C. STATE.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a be rry@a Iigator org
Chandler Parsons' miracle 75-foot game-win-
ner at N.C. State on Sunday may have salvaged
Florida's Christmas break, but it didn't hide the
ugly truth from Billy Donovan.
The Gators' outside shooting was miserable
against the Wolfpack.
Before Kenny Boynton nailed a leaning three-
pointer with a hand in his face from the top of the
key with 14 seconds left in overtime, UF was 1 of
22 from beyond the arc.
Florida is shooting 29 percent from three-
point range this season, hitting just 84 of its 287
attempts. Donovan attributed some of his team's
struggles to the shot selection of his four primary
outside shooters -Boynton, Parsons, Erving
Walker and Dan Werner.
"When those four guys take the kind of shots
that they're accustomed to making, they shoot
a very high percentage," Donovan said. "When
they get some of their shots that are a little more
difficult for them, that has really bled into some
of their shooting woes."
Boynton, heralded as a great scorer before the
season, leads the team in scoring (13.6 points per
game) but has been an inconsistent shooter so far.
The freshman guard is shooting 36 percent from
the field and 26 percent from three-point range.
Despite the low percentages, Boynton has es-
tablished himself as a potential threat in crunch
time.
The only three-pointer he hit against N.C.
State was the difficult, contested shot in the final Andrew Stanfill / Alligator
seconds that kept UF in the game. UF guard Erving Walker has stuggled beyond the three-point arc this season.
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 15 The Gators are shooting 29 percent this season from long range.
Hoops team better than expected but needs work
hank God for Chandler Parsons.His 75-foot heave changed the
tone of a pretty poor Christmas break
for the Florida men's basketball team.
UF was on a pretty good high at the end
of fall classes, ranked No. 10 in the country
and ready for a top-10 showdown with Syr-
acuse in a matchup of the early season's top
two surprises.
The Gators fell short against the Orange,
but even Florida's first loss was encourag-
ing. The Gators looked like they belonged,
and if they shored up just a few key areas -
shooting and boxing out especially -they
could be a major force in March.o t
Phil Kegler
Phil on the Hill
p kegler@a ligator orgAnd this is com-
ing from a guy who
wasn't really sold on
Florida before the
season. I predicted
the team to go 6-10 in
SoutheasternConfer-
ence play and miss
the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the third-
straight year.
After seeing UF play Syracuse in Tampa,
I immediately admitted I had pegged the
team wrong. There was no way in my mind
the Gators weren't worthy of playing in theBig Dance.
Florida proceeded to drop its next two
against Richmond and South Alabama
(making me wonder if I really know any-

rise was a little understandable. While RPI
isn't the end-all, be-all barometer of a team's
talent -it often matters who you play more
than your wins and losses -Richmond
currently checks in at No. 26 and also has a
win over Mississippi State.
But South Alabama? At home? The Jag-
uars have an RPI of 154. They're not good,
and they're not a team Florida should be

two to fill
RB, LB jobs

The revolving door of coaches at Flor-
ida continues to spin.
The Gators hired two assistants Tues-
day, Stan Drayton and D.J. Durkin, to fill
vacancies as running backs and lineback-
ers coaches, respectively.
Drayton will replace Kenny Carter,
while Durkin comes in for former defen-
sive coordinator and linebackers coach
Charlie Strong, now Louisville's head
coach. Carter is expected to join Strong's
staff, though no announcement has been
made.
"[UF interim coach Steve Addaziol
and I worked together on this and are
excited to have D.J. and Stan join our
coaching staff," Urban
Meyer said in a press
release. "Both guys are
familiar with the plan
we have for our pro-
gram, our coaches and
our student-athletes. It
will be a smooth tran-
Drayton sition and they both
bring a high level of
expertise to the table and have proven to
be good recruiters."
Drayton is especially familiar with the
program, as he coached at Florida from
2005-07. He spent this season at Syracuse
after coaching at Tennessee in 2008, and
when he left UF for the Volunteers, he
voiced his frustrations with the way run-
ning backs are used in the offense.
Now, he'll have a stable of talented
backs. Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey and Em-
manuel Moody are proven threats from
the backfield, while freshman Mike Gil-
lislee showed potential this season.
Carter's departure could affect re-
cruiting, as it may cause Lithonia (Ga.)
King High running back Mack Brown to
reconsider his verbal commitment to UF.
Brown's coach told the Orlando Sentinel
on Tuesday that Brown was "confused"
by the move and is re-evaluating his op-
tions.
Durkin comes to Gainesville after
three years at Stanford working with de-
fensive ends and special teams. Durkin
played at Bowling Green, where he was
a graduate assistant under Meyer.

E Stan Drayton might not have left Florida on good terms with Urban Meyer,
but apparently a year with Phil Fulmer and another in the Big East was enough
for him to suck up any animosity and coach under Meyer again. .Bears coach

Donovan tells team to keep shooting
HOOPS, from page 14
"He maybe has a better ability than some of
the guys on our team to make tough, challenged
shots, but over the stretch of a season or the
stretch of a game, his shooting percentage is not
going to be very high," Donovan said. "At the
end of a game with a challenged shot, he's got
the ability to do that. Erving Walker's also got the
ability to make challenged shots.
"But if a high percentage of those shots are
going to be challenged, they're probably going
to shoot a low percentage. That's just the way it
equals out."
Walker has also struggled at times to find his
shot from long range, shooting just 29 percent on
the year after finishing his freshman season at a
team-high 42 percent.
Part of the problem for Boynton and Walker
has been the amount of responsibility put on
them to score from the outside, run the break andlead UF's press while having to lead the team in
minutes due to the team's shortage of guards.
Donovan has tried to relieve Walker recent-
ly by subbing him out for Parsons before the
16-minute media timeout, giving the starting
point guard more time on the bench, but the
two guards are still averaging a team-high 32.1
minutes per game so far this
season.
"We got two backcourt
guys basically that we're uti-
Men's lizing. We have a lack of depth
Basketball there," Donovan said. "I'd like
to try to keep Boynton and
Walker below 35 minutes a
game. I think that's too much for them."
Although the shots haven't been falling for
Florida, Donovan said he's not going to tell his
players to back off from the outside.
"The last thing they need to hear is me telling
them to stop shooting," Donovan said.
PHIL, from page 14
losing to in a year it hopes to
return to the NCAA Tourna-
ment.
"Do we have weaknesses,
like any other team? Sure,"
Florida coach Billy Donovan
said. "We have weaknesses all
over the place. You try to cam-
ouflage them. You have a bet-
ter effort of camouflaging them
when you have guys that are
willing to physically make the
effort.
"[The players] are focused
on the things that really go in
and impact winning. They're
trying to do those things."
I do think Florida will hear
its name on Selection Sunday,but Donovan points out the
reason why a snub this year
might be the most painful of all
-he finally has his guys doing
what he wants. He has a group
of guys in great shape willing
to play defense, but backcourt
depth and poor shooting still
loom as potential roadblocks
on UF's journey.
With Ray Shipman battling
injury, starting guards Kenny
Boynton and Erving Walker are
averaging more than 32 min-
utes per game, and neither are
connecting on even 30 percent
of their shots from beyond the
arc. Boynton leads the team in
scoring at 13.6 points per game,
but the freshman is shooting
just 36.3 percent from the fieldand 25.5 percent from three-
point range.
No matter how great UF
plays defense, it will need to
find some offense if it wants to
return to its early season form.
Florida scored just 53 points in
the loss to Richmond and only
48 during regulation against
N.C. State.
"Every SEC team is excited
to start this time of year," Don-
ovan said. "[The players] un-
derstand -especially the old
guys -what this league is like
and how challenging it is."
Hopefully they also under-
stand they better start hitting
some shots, or the blues are go-
ing to continue all the way until

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Mossor hopes to regain form
Jennifer Mossor's New Year's
resolution may as well have been
to have a healthy rest of the sea-
son.
The senior was hampered by
injuries in 2009, from beginning
to end.
After starting the first 16 games
of her junior campaign, Mossor
tore her right ACL against Missis-
sippi State on Jan. 8, 2009 -the
team's first conference game of the
season.
She missed the rest of that sea-
son as the Gators finished 24-8
and lost in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament to Connecti-
cut, the eventual national cham-
pions.
The year hurled its second chal-
lenge at Mossor when she tore her
left lateral meniscus in practice on
Nov. 12, two days before the start
of her senior season.
"Frustration -it goes beyond
that," Mossor said. "I've just been
injured, injured, injured, and to
finally not be injured -I'm still
dealing with the injury and ev-
erything that goes along with it -
but actually being a part of what
I've been trying to be a part of this
whole time and what I've beenBy EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@alligator orgwaiting for, feels great."
After rehabbing and getting
back into playing form, Mossor
saw her first action of the 2009-10
season against Southern on Dec.
20.
It had been 346 days since her
last meaningful appearance.
"SEC is the biggest time of
the year and the most im-
portant, so it's better to be
back for that than anything
else."
Jennifer Mossor
UF senior guard
She saw eight minutes of court
time against Southern, and in the
team's next game, a loss to High
Point, she scored seven points on
3-of-4 shooting.
Her most playing time was
logged against Ohio, when she
was on the floor for 13 minutes.
"I'm still not fully back," Mos-
sor said. "It just feels good to be
more of a part of the team, because
when you're injured you're just
kind of off to the side."
Coach Amanda Butler said
Mossor's value lies in her physi-
cality on the perimeter, a guard
who is as likely to attack the rim
as shoot from the wing."Jenn is really a great mix of a
kid who's a good player because
of her physical gifts but mixes in
a very, very high basketball IQ,"
Butler said.
Added time on the bench heal-
ing her wounds has forced Mos-
sor to sit, observe, mentor, and
develop a perspective of the game
available to those who watch rath-
er than play.
The most frustrating part of
the ordeal was the fact that Mos-
sor, who was a starter in her junior
year and the team's fourth-leading
scorer (9.1 points per game) before
her injury, has been relegated to a
supporting role so far this season.
Rejoining a squad that has been
playing for nearly two months
without her and had hit a few
bumps earlier in the season has
forced Mossor to try and find a
new place on the team.
If the team's identity is to mold
to Mossor, her return has come at
a pivotal time: the beginning of
Southeastern Conference play.
"SEC is the biggest time of the
year and the most important, so
it's better to be back for that than
anything else," she said.
Florida won its SEC opener
against Arkansas, and they will
host Auburn on Thursday before
heading to No. 8 Georgia on Sun-
day.Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF senior guard Jennifer Mossor is looking to bounce back from
an injury-plagued 2009 and regain a starting spot.
