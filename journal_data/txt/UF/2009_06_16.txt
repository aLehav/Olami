Giving blood never tasted so good.  
This week, local LifeSouth Community Blood Centers are of-
fering a free pint of Blue Bell ice cream in exchange for blood do-nations to cope with the summer slump. 
“UF students account for 20 to 25 percent of our donations,” 
LifeSouth community development coordi-nator Clay Gibbons said. “And when school lets out for the summer, we notice a signifi-cant decline.”
After donating, participants will receive a coupon that is re-
deemable at stores carrying Blue Bell ice cream.
The ‘Pint for a Pint’ drive will run through Sunday at Life-
South’s two Gainesville locations, 4039 Newberry Road and 1221 NW 13th St., and at the Alachua donation center.  
Rosemarie Gann, who has donated blood in the area for 30 
years, stopped by a local center to give blood Monday.  
“I want my donations to be sent to the children,” Gann said.  As for her free pint of ice cream, Gann was pleased but wasn’t 
aware of the promotion beforehand. “I would have come any-way,” she said, “but it makes it a good day to come.”

Two members of the Gator Nation will square-
off over a party foul on national TV today in a pre-
recorded episode of “Judge Joe Brown.”
Felipe Martinez, 21, successfully sued Chris 
Carlo, 23, in the judge’s California courtroom for 
$2,872 in damages to his ‘98 Chrysler Concorde. 
Martinez attends UF, and Carlo is a former stu-dent.
On Jan. 23, the defendant, Carlo showed up 
to Martinez’s birthday party uninvited. Carlo got drunk, climbed onto Martinez’s Chrysler and stomped, breaking the windshield and leaving flip-flop prints on the black car’s hood, according to a press release. 
After going to small claims court in Alachua County, Martinez decided to take the case to Judge Brown to claim $2,872 in damages.
Carlo remembers nothing of the event and said 
Martinez exaggerated the costs of repairing the 
car, according to the release. The show paid for the damag-es, which is partially why the litigants decided to participate, Martinez said.  
After all the conflict, Marti-
nez reports there are no hard feelings.
“It’s no big deal,” Martinez 
said. “We can all make mis-
takes when we get drunk. I am not going to hold a grudge.”
The show will air on Gainesville’s WAWS 
(Fox) Channel 30 at 7 p.m., the release stated.Students settle financial

� BRIGHT FUTURES WILL 
NOT COVER THE INCREASE.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
Students will likely pay about 16 
percent more for classes this fall af-
ter UF’s Board of Trustees approved 
the increases at Friday’s meeting.
The board approved the maxi-
mum tuition hike under the state’s differential tuition plan, which al-lows a 15 percent increase each year 
until each of the state’s 11 public 
universities reaches the national av-erage.
The increase, which the Board 
of Governors is expected to ap-prove this week, is not covered by the Bright Futures scholarship pro-gram.
The board also approved fee in-
creases and the implementation of a 
new technology fee.
Matt Fajack, UF’s chief financial 
officer, also briefed the trustees on a new budget model that will change 
the way colleges within UF are funded.
The new model, being imple-
mented as a result of the budget crisis, makes costs more transparent 
and rewards certain benchmarks.
“It’s really based on how produc-
tive you are–the number of (student credit hours) you teach, the number 
of students that are enrolled in your program, the amount of research 
you do, the ability to be creative and 
come up with entrepreneurial rev-enues,” Fajack said.
A 71-year-old Gainesville man was 
banned from campus Wednesday after he 
poked a 21-year-old female UF student in the butt three times at Library West, according to the University Police Department.
Marion Danzy allegedly poked the stu-
dent three times in the span of about a min-ute and then left the library, at which point the student contacted library security, ac-cording to police.
The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. An officer caught up with Danzy minutes 
later outside the library, where he was identi-fied by the student and banned from campus for three years. Danzy spoke poor English and might have been homeless, said UPD Of-ficer Chris McIlrath.
The student declined to press charges, so 
UPD will not forward the case to the state at-torney’s office. No other students reported being touched by Danzy.

Harn Museum
exhibit displays
abstract artwork
By PATRICK ANNESTY
Alligator Contributing Writer
“Rediscovering Slobodkina: 
A Pioneer of American Abstrac-
tion” will debut today at the 
Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, showcasing the work of Esphyr Slobodkina. 
One of the first female Ameri-
can abstract artists, Slobodkina produced more than 500 works of art including the famous chil-dren’s book “Caps for Sale.”
Running through Sept. 6, the 
exhibit will showcase 66 works including paintings, drawings and abstract constructions made with dissembled everyday items.
Dulce Roman, the museum’s 
modern art curator, said the exhi-bition was chosen to commemo-rate the recent purchase of Slo-
bodkina’s “Mural Sketch No. 1.”
“The modern collection has 
so few works by women artists, 
making this an especially won-derful acquisition for the muse-um,” she said.
Roman said the Harn lent the 
piece to the traveling exhibit be-fore it could even be displayed in the museum.
The exhibition also displays a 
few of Slobodkina’s major works 
from the 1940s including “Cross-
road No. 2,” on loan from the 
Smithsonian Amer-ican Art Museum.
In 2002, two 
years before her death at the age 
of 93, Slobodkina established the Slobodkina Foundation to showcase her works. The tour-
ing exhibit is organized by the 
foundation in conjunction with 
the Heckscher Museum of Art in 
Huntington, N.Y. 
The first guided tour of the ex-
hibit will take place Sunday at 2 p.m., followed by a more formal lecture on the life and works of Slobodkina.Gainesville police are awaiting the autopsy 
results for a man whose body was discovered 
near Northwest 23rd Avenue Monday morn-
ing.
At about 10 a.m., people walking on North-
west 23rd Avenue saw two legs poking out 
from under bushes near the intersection of 
Northwest 23rd Avenue and Northwest Eighth Street.
When they arrived at the scene, Gainesville 
Police Department officers found the decom-
posing body of Robert Ware, 50, in front of Bet-
ty Hilgendorf Real Estate, 738 NW 23rd Ave.GPD Lt. Mike Schiboula said the police are 
waiting for the autopsy results, which will be 
available later today. Schiboula said no foul 
play was suspected.
Schiboula said that Ware lived in Gator Vil-
lage, 321 NW 21st Lane, near where his body 
was found.
He said that Ware lived with a roommate 
who reported him missing Thursday night.
His roommate said that Ware had some 
health conditions that authorities are looking into, Schiboula said.

� SKEPTICS SAY TWEETING WON’T
LEAD TO MORE TRANSPARENCY.
Since Friday, Student Body President Jor-
dan Johnson has been “tweeting” at the student 
body.
“This is a way for any student to see where 
their money is going every minute of the day,” Johnson said in a press release.
Johnson said the Twitter postings, which 
came about a month after Student Senate Pro-
Tempore Suzanne Hershman’s Twitter debut, is a departure from former closed-door attitudes.
 “Both of these developments are just the be-
ginning of how I see my administration working to improve student life while at the same time being accessible to the public,” Johnson said.Casey Barrett, a history major at UF, said she 
is unsure of how effective Twitter use will be.
“I don’t think this will lead to any more 
transparency, to be honest,” Barrett said.
While some students enjoy 
using and following Twitter, 
she said, it is not something 
widespread enough to affect 
the majority of students.
“I don’t even look at my 
best friend’s Twitter. There’s 
no way I’m going to look at 
student government’s,” she said, laughing.

George Elmore has attended 
city hall and town hall meet-
ings for 37 years, but he says 
this one was not like the rest. 
“Most people in attendance 
came to preserve what they have,” Elmore said, referring 
to the 5 percent budget cut the 
city will have to make in the upcoming fiscal year. “The de-clining revenue base is tough 
for all of us.”
The City Commission host-
ed a special town hall meet-
ing Monday night in District 4. Commissioners received 
input from about 35 residents 
on the 2010 fiscal year budget and the 10-year Evaluation and Appraisal Report of the City’s 
comprehensive plan.
Although residents’ main 
concern was the city’s budget 
cut, the City Commission lis-tened to local opinions on top-
ics such as land use, design and 
redevelopment, transportation, the environment, quality of life and economic issues, all sub-
categories within the report.
Resident Melanie Barr 
thought the meeting was pro-
ductive.
“The City Commission was 
very attentive to what we had to say,” she said.
Barr said she also found the 
process enlightening.
“It was difficult to come up 
with answers because we know that cutting programs means 
people lose jobs,” she said. 
“We got to see what the City Commission does on a regular basis.”

� HE KILLED A MAN AFTER THE UF-
FSU FOOTBALL GAME IN 2007.

After a three-day murder trial, a 
Gainesville man was sentenced to life in pris-
on for killing Tallahassee resident Andrew Arosamena in the Downtown Gainesville Parking Garage about a year and a half ago, hours after a UF - FSU football game.
The Nov. 26, 2007 shooting occurred on 
the second floor of the Southwest Downtown 
Parking Garage near Market Street Pub. 
At about 2:20 a.m., a blue car was block-
ing traffic on the garage’s exit ramp.
Arosamena rolled down the passenger-
side window of the car he was in and yelled 
at the driver to move. Nelson, who was talking to people in the blue car, walked over to the car Arosamena was in and shot him in the head, Mann said.
Okpara Nelson, 23, was 
charged with two consecu-
tive life sentences for first-degree murder and armed burglary, at about 6 p.m. 
Friday at the Alachua County Courthouse.Co-defendant Antwan Maye, 26, offered 
a no contest plea shortly after the shoot-ing, said State Attorney’s Office spokesman Spencer Mann.
After entering the plea, Maye was sen-
tenced to four years in prison on charges of accessory after the fact to first-degree mur-der, tampering with evidence and aggravat-ed assault with a firearm, Mann said.
As part of Maye’s no contest deal, he had 
to testify against Nelson in the trial. Man gets life in prison for parking garage shooting“The City Commission

Although one UF program is used 
to drama, a potential $90,000 budget cut 
might be a tough act to follow. 
Like other departments, the UF Per-
forming Arts program is facing a 10 per-cent cut, which could possibly cost the program $90,000.
With about 50 scheduled performanc-
es, the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts will be offering fewer shows this sea-son to keep costs within the budget range, said James Kersey, assistant box office 
manager.
The program started reducing produc-
tions about two years ago to prepare for 
possible cuts, said Elizabeth Auer, assis-tant director of the center.
To keep production diversity through-
out the season, the center cut one perfor-mance from each genre to avoid eliminat-
ing any one particular branch of the arts.
“It is important to us that we still offer a 
broad range of styles to create options for 
everyone attending,” said Auer.
This season, the center will be bring in 
well-known musicals such as “Hairspray” and “Cats” in addition to “Avenue Q,” a 2003-debuting musical that pokes fun at is-
sues like drinking and porn.
Although event tickets 
range from $30 to $50, with the help of Student Govern-ment, performing arts tickets 
will be available to UF students for $10 in the upcoming season. General tickets will go on sale June 18 while student tickets will be available starting Aug. 3.
Marketing coordinator Marilyn Patrick 
said in order to reach more students and improve ticket sales, UF Performing Arts will be creating a Twitter account this fall.Season to bring fewer

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.  — NASA will 
try to launch space shuttle Endeavour again 
Wednesday, after repairing a hydrogen gas leak that thwarted the first attempt.
Top officials decided Monday to bump 
an unmanned moon mission so Endeavour could have another shot at flying to the in-ternational space station.
The delayed moon mission is NASA’s 
first in a decade and is critical to the space agency’s long-term effort to return humans to the lunar surface.
The Atlas V rocket had been scheduled 
to blast off Wednesday with a pair of lunar 
probes — a moon-mapping orbiter and a 
craft meant to crash into a shadowed cra-ter at the moon’s south pole. That launch is now scheduled for no earlier than Thurs-day; it would slip to Friday if the shuttle countdown proceeds trouble-free into early Wednesday.
“If you’ve spent any time on the Space 
Coast and monitoring launches, you no-
tice that they tend to attract each other, 
and we’ve got that very situation here,” said Chuck Dovale, launch director for the moon mission.
NASA ended up having to choose be-
tween the two missions because Endeavour could not launch this past Saturday. The potentially dangerous hydrogen gas leak in the vent line leading to the shuttle’s exter-nal fuel tank halted the countdown. Techni-
cians finished the repairs Monday.
The launch is scheduled for 5:40 a.m. 
Wednesday. Forecasters put the odds of 
good weather at 80 percent.
NASA is giving Endeavour just one 
chance, on Wednesday, to get off on its space station construction mission before making way for the moon shot.
Endeavour and its crew of seven must 
be flying by this weekend, otherwise it will 
have to wait until mid-July. That’s because 
of unfavorable sun angles that would heat the shuttle too much while it is docked to the space station.NASA to attempt launch

While wondering 
what midtown bar you should 
visit on Friday evening re-mains a bigger Gainesville 
no-brainer than taking an 
online course, pondering where to move post-college could be deemed almost un-answerable. 
From the co-creator of 
Flikr comes a new Web site bound to provide sound re-sponses to even your most 
trying questions.
Enter Hunch.com, stage 
left.
Once you and Hunch be-
come acquainted over a pro-
verbial whiskey or two (aka a series of 20 questions), the site offers help in answering pressing questions such as 
what type of car you should 
purchase.
The Editorial Board gave 
the site a whirl and had our Opinions Editor determine where he should go on va-cation, conveniently disre-garding the fact he is cur-rently drowning in a sea of graduate school debt.
After making a few re-
sponses to indicate certain criteria he enjoys (alcohol, unfortunately, was not an option), Hunch recom-mended taking a trip to Chi-cago. Interestingly enough, he plans on taking a trip to Chicago come August, so perhaps, dare we say, 
Hunch is on to something.
Let’s be frank for a sec-
ond. The site in no way 
should be used to determine whether you should accept your college boyfriend’s marriage proposal. Hell, guest columnist Matthew Meltzer should have han-
dled that decision for you. 
Nonetheless, Hunch offers a refreshing distraction from the oh-so-stale Web site ro-tation of Facebook, Twitter and The New York Times.Tragedy struck suburban Orlando on Monday with 
news of a murder-suicide claiming the lives of a Heathrow family.
John Wood, 41, shot and killed his wife and two chil-
dren before taking his own life in their posh gated commu-nity. Sadly, what may appear as eye-opening news for most neighborhoods could be deemed commonplace in Central 
Florida.
According to an article in the Orlando Sentinel, there 
have been at least six murder-suicides in the region since 
Jan. 1. Three took place within a 10-day period in May.
While there does not appear to be a common thread link-
ing the cases, the Wood family’s financial woes may have triggered the unfortunate situation.
Forced to find a new job at a sporting goods store, Wood 
filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and was set to appear before 
an Orlando court in August to hash out his fiscal status. On 
top of the patriarch’s financial misgivings, Cynthia Wood recently lost her job. The story of the Wood family’s un-fortunate struggles echo a tale currently being lived out by countless families across the country.
Simply put, times are tough.For a man to give up hope and end the lives of his wife 
and young children speaks of an individual who let fi-nances dictate the course of his life. There is no denying the 
fact that the ability to find inner peace while struggling to 
balance a budget demands persistence and determination. But as dire as one’s situation may seem, the selfish act of a murder-suicide should never be rendered a viable option.
I sure hope that Minnesota can get used to being a congressional amputee. 
Ever since the state’s controversial November 
election, a legal battle has ensued over who won the rights to a seat in the U.S Senate. 
At first it seemed that Norm Coleman, a Republi-
can, had eked out a victory. But an automatic recount, 
triggered by the small margin of victory, found come-
dian Al Franken to be the winner. The state Canvassing Board met and affirmed Franken’s victory. The matter has been taken to the Minnesota Supreme Court and a ruling should be handed down soon. 
The smart money is on Franken.Of course, none of this is to say that Minnesota is 
remotely near electing a senator. Coleman has indicated that he is willing to take this matter all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court.
I’m at a loss to fathom the depths of poor sportsman-
ship that are driving Coleman to these extremes. Have 
the memories of the invective heaped upon Al Gore when he retracted his concession already faded from 
Republican minds? It seems so.
Interestingly enough, the results of a recent Minne-
sota poll indicate that 64 percent of Coleman’s constitu-
ents actually favor his concession.
An equally high percentage of Minnesotans expect 
his defeat, whether they want it or not. Furthermore, Coleman’s numbers are weak even when only Repub-licans are polled.
The message is clear: A majority of Minnesotans be-
lieve Coleman should bow out gracefully.
I’m impressed by the tenacity of the man once 
dubbed the “fourth most corrupt senator.” In the digni-fied body that housed Ted Stevens, that is quite the accomplishment. Coleman only wants what’s right 
for Minnesotans and is determined 
to do everything in his power to ensure they receive that most pre-cious gift: himself. He will pursue 
this course of action, even to the 
point of abusing the democratic 
process.
All of this is fair, though. Coleman has the right to 
throw a hissy fit and sue. That’s one of the benefits of 
the American political system. When an election out-
come is too close to call, a candidate can can turn to the judicial process rather than resorting to riots and vio-lence. The only problem is that, ordinarily, there should 
be some evidence of foul play to support judicial media-
tion. Simply saying “no fair” because you lost is both absurd and pathetic.
Don’t expect this situation to be resolved anytime 
soon. There is a lot at stake. If Franken wins, the Demo-
crats will have their filibuster-proof 60 seats. And, de-
spite the general trend of public opinion, Norm Cole-man does have a core group of support. They will stick with him to the bitter end, which may come in an Ala-
mo-style last stand in front of justices Antonin Scalia, 
John Roberts, Ruth Ginsberg and the rest of the merry pranksters. Coleman has decided to fight, and will, but he should consider one thing:
Is his obstinacy even remotely in the best interest of 
Minnesotans? This observer doubts it.

Abdul-Azim Mohammed was pro-
viding a play-by-play of the Iran Election early Sunday morning. 
Azim first reported that local police sta-tions had been forced to burn ballot boxes filled with votes for Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s presidential 
challenger. A few minutes later, Azim de-
clared that Internet access and phone lines had been cut off. Later, Azim’s reports of people filling the streets of Tehran were verified with BBC footage showing legions 
of angry young Iranians chanting “Death 
to the Dictator” in the streets.
Azim was on a roll. In less than two hours his Internet fol-
lowers had grown from just a handful to more than 2,000 fans checking in for real-time updates of the growing tension caused by a widely suspected rigged presidential election in Iran. His report that his brother 
had seen riots breaking out in northeast 
Iran was as eerie as his report that the Ira-nian government was claiming that power failure and cell phone tower outages were caused by maintenance on the city’s elec-trical grid. Then, reports of sirens in his 
neighborhood hindered the number of 
times Azim could give the world a glimpse into the electoral drama unfolding across Iran. Shortly after the sirens had passed his 
street, Azim told his audience that he was 
using an illegal satellite dish as his connec-tion to the outside world and wrote one last post, “I have to shut down for a bit, the police are looking for satellites.”
That was Saturday at 6:14 p.m. EST.Abdul-Azim Mohammed is not a pro-
fessional journalist. Azim is a 22-year-old college student living in Iran’s capital city, 
and much like his western counterparts, 
he’s a fan of the social messaging Web site Twitter, where for more than three hours early Sunday morning he sent out 31 tweets, or mini messages, about the state 
of Iran in the aftermath of its presidential 
election upset.
While it should be noted that Azim’s identity cannot be verified, there are millions of young 
Iranians just like him 
taking to the streets across Iran protest-ing the supposed 
electoral landslide 
that President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian Interior Department and the Ayatollah Ali Khame-nei are all claiming.
What the protestors are claiming is 
vastly different than a landslide for Ah-madinejad. Many believe fraud. Still, an anonymous female Iranian journalist in an 
interview with Radio Free Europe castigat-
ed outside observers who called the elec-tion a fraud. “There was no fraud; it was a coup,” she told her interviewer.
Whether it is a coup or an unexpected 
election upset, none of the powers-that-be in Iran could have predicted the influence of the Millennial Generation. When their votes were discounted, the young Iranians showed up to polling places in record num-bers. And when the government confiscated 
NBC and ABC cameras and yanked foreign 
visas, they never predicted the young Ira-nians would take to Web sites like Twitter and organize protests and mass exoduses 
to rooftops in the night to shout Allah Ak-
bar, or God is Great. Interestingly enough, the last time such an ordeal happened was in 1979 when the Shah skipped town after another young generation of Iranians took 
to the streets.
As black smoke clouds the Tehran sky-
line and young Mousavi supporters orga-
nize more protests from Twitter and Fa-
cebook, one has to wonder if the mullahs 
and the Iranian old guard underestimated the power today’s instant technological communications can play in democracies. Perhaps revolutions are, technically, gen-
erational.

Value of college education depends on wealth, intelligenceGuest columnIranian youth rely on Twitter to inform world about elections
It seems like every year, when 
the graduation fanfare has subsided and the confetti has 
reached the floor, graduates turn their eyes to the piece of paper standing in for four years of trial and tuition and ask the rather 
pressing question, “What did I 
just put myself through?”
It’s inevitable even in good 
times, much less a recession. Did we just make a bunch of people 
waste their money and time?
Granted, some skills you learn 
in college are directly applicable 
to specific fields. If you want to be 
an accountant, studying account-
ing is really the only way to go. The criticism usually focuses on people who choose more esoteric, liberal-arts majors. In place of fi-
nance expertise, the job market 
tends to see the choice of personal fulfillment as nothing more than a  handicap.
When liberal arts graduates en-
ter the job market, they give their college degree as more of a sym-bol than a qualification. Graduat-ing college means you are train-
able, capable of seeing something 
through to the end and presum-ably smarter than you were before. But none of that can necessarily be 
traced back to college, especially 
by potential employers.Maybe you 
were already smart enough 
for the job 
in question before you went to 
school; maybe you were always committed; and maybe studying 
art history won’t actually help 
you sell real estate or insurance.
Meanwhile, universities, re-
sponding to a greater desire from high school graduates who want-
ed to stay competitive for the best 
jobs, opened up more campuses and created more paths to a col-lege degree. The problem is the 
best students took to going to 
graduate school in greater num-bers. The momentary advantage given by a more equal disburse-ment of college diplomas was 
simply nullified by those who 
were always more academic or in-telligent (or wealthy).
College is still, as it was 50 
years ago, extremely expensive and extremely time-consuming. The difference is that it’s also now necessary for jobs that, 50 years ago, could have been taken 
by high school graduates. But for 
those who couldn’t attend college, because the money wasn’t there or because they weren’t academ-
ic enough to attend a university, 
they are now excluded from an opportunity they were not unsuit-able for.
All this has a very polarizing 
effect. The uppermost get the jobs they were always going to get; the middle get the jobs they had be-fore; but the least fortunate sud-
denly find that they cannot afford 
to pursue opportunities they used to have.
And, yes, the general popula-
tion is left better educated. It is 
also poorer and has less choice. 
Especially in these times, is that a burden we want to impose on our citizens?

ana University.

Burke Bender, of Bender & Associates Architects, speaks about the Depot Building project to 
the Community Redevelopment Agency at City Hall on Monday.
By JIMMIE PAUL
Alligator Contributing Writer
It may cost $1.5 to $2.3 million to re-
construct Gainesville’s historic Depot 
building, a long-term city project locat-
ed just south of downtown.
But Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan, who 
has been a long-term proponent of the project, said its price was too steep at 
a Community Redevelopment Agency 
meeting Monday.
Burke Bender, of Bender & Associ-
ates Architects, provided the estimate.
“I think it’s a little crazy to spend $2.3 
million to reconstruct a depot building that cost us $80,000,” Hanrahan said. 
The money would go toward restor-
ing Gainesville’s oldest train depot, 
and the large price tag includes money-saving sustainability standards, Bender 
said.
While she hopes to cut the project’s 
budget, Hanrahan still believes it is 
worthwhile.
“Purchasing and investing in the 
Depot is an excellent investment,” she 
said. “Gainesville was actually formed as a hub on the rail line, which was 
key to the development of the state of 
Florida.“Mayor wants to cut

� THE PLAYERS WILL RIDE DURING 
GPD’S BUSIEST HOURS.
By ROBERTA O. ROBERTS
Alligator Writer
During the next few weeks, expect to see 
Florida football players seated in the front, 
not the back, of local police cruisers.
In four years, the UF football team has 
racked up 21 arrests, including nine felonies, 
and three citations. In light of these num-
bers, the University Athletic Association and Gainesville Police Department partnered to provide a way for players to see what the other side of law enforcement is like. 
Football players can volunteer to attend a 
ride-along with GPD officers between 5 p.m. 
and 4 a.m., the department’s busiest hours, 
said GPD spokesman Lt. Mike Schibuola. 
“Students get arrested every weekend, 
but student-athletes get more attention,” he said, adding that the arrest rate is similar for both groups. According to Schibuola, about 25 students are arrested every weekend, usu-ally for possession of alcohol by a minor or underage drinking. 
In April 2007, former offensive guard Ron-
nie Wilson was arrested on charges of battery and discharging a firearm in public, an inci-dent that sparked the phrase “University of 
Felons in Gunsville, Fla.” to be used by Gator critics. 
Wilson reportedly spat 
on someone outside of a Gainesville nightclub, took 
an AK-47 assault rifle out of the trunk of a car and fired it into the air.
After two charges for 
marijuana possession and 
a misdemeanor for battery and assault, Wil-
son was kicked off the team. 
Earlier this month, starting cornerback Ja-noris Jenkins was Tasered and arrested after 
fighting five people outside of a Gainesville nightclub.
Steve Russell, radio personality for AM 
850’s “Sport Scene,” feels the arrests of Flor-ida football players has been sensationalized.
“In the summer, stories that might not be 
a big deal in the heat of competition become a little more blown up because there is nothing going on,” Russell said.
Still, Russell does not excuse the rate of UF 
football player arrests. 
“Bottom line, there are probably too many, 
and it is the head coach’s responsibility to help make it better,” Russell said.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TEHRAN, Iran — In a massive 
outpouring reminiscent of the Is-
lamic Revolution three decades 
ago, hundreds of thousands of Ira-
nians streamed through the capital Monday, and the fist-waving pro-testers denounced President Mah-
moud Ahmadinejad’s claim to vic-
tory in a disputed election.
Standing on rooftops, pro-gov-
ernment gunmen opened fire on a group of protesters who had tried 
to storm the militia’s compound. 
One man was killed, and several others were wounded in the worst violence since the disputed elec-
tion Friday.
Angry men showed their 
bloody palms after cradling the 
dead and wounded who had been part of a crowd that stretched more 
than five miles supporting reform 
leader Mir Hossein Mousavi.
The huge rally reinforced what 
has become increasingly clearer 
since the election: The opposition 
forces rallying behind Mousavi show no signs of backing down. Their resolve appears to have pushed Iran’s Islamic establish-
ment into attempts to cool the ten-
sions after days of unrest.
Police and other security forces 
stood by quietly — some sitting on stoops with their batons and shields resting behind them as the marchers swallowed the streets in parts of Tehran. Estimates put the turnout at hundreds of thousands overflowing the square, where crowds of 200,000 have filled the plaza in the past.
Mousavi made his first public appearance since the polls closed, and he launched his claims that 
the vote was rigged to re-elect the 
hard-line president.
Brief clips of the march were 
shown on state television in an extremely rare nod to anti-govern-ment attacks.
“Respect the people’s vote!” 
Mousavi cried through a hand-held loudspeaker in Azadi, or 
Freedom, Square — where Iran’s 
leaders hold military and political gatherings.
It appeared that Iran’s ruling 
clerics had opened the door for the demonstration — even giving it news coverage — in a possible bid to avoid more street clashes and seek some breathing room in the 
growing confrontation.
The United States was “deeply 
troubled” by reports of violence 
and arrests in Iran, State Depart-
ment spokesman Ian Kelly said, 
but he added that the U.S. knows too little about the conduct of the election to say for sure whether there was fraud.
Britain and Germany joined the 
calls of alarm over the rising con-frontations in Iran. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry summoned the 
Iranian ambassador to discuss the 
allegations of vote-tampering and the violence.TUESDAY, JUNE 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Protesters, who asked not to be identified, demonstrate on Turlington Plaza Monday against the results 
of the election in Iran. They believe the results, showing incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadineiad as the winner, are fraudulent.
Hundreds of thousands of Iranians protest election
“It is an extremely rational approach,” said 
Trustee Al Warrington, “that I think we as 
trustees should demand and require.”
UF President Bernie Machen, however, said if it wasn’t for budget cuts, he’d rather stick with the status quo.
“We are not a business; we are an academic 
institution,” he said. “But it would be naïve of 
us to sit here and not recognize that we need to pay attention to the way other entities, includ-
ing businesses, operate.”Trustees also approved a change that will 
make it easier to lay off staff.
Instead of only being able to 
consider length of employment 
and performance evaluations for some staff layoffs, UF will 
now be able to consider other factors, like skill and education.
Paula Cunningham, an office assistant in 
agronomy, told trustees she didn’t think staff 
members were properly notified of the pro-
posed change, which, she argued, will erode the job security of “thousands of UF’s most 
dedicated employees.”UF will now be able to consider skill and education level when making layoffs

WOMEN’S GOLF COACH HIREDHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
Former UF pitcher Stacey Nelson was named to the 2009 USA Softball Women’s National Team on Monday.

After representing her 
school for four years, Stacey 
Nelson will move on to repre-sent her country.
Nelson, who holds nearly 
every UF softball pitching re-cord, was one of 18 players named to the 2009 USA Soft-ball Women’s National Team and one of 16 named to the Japan Cup team on Monday after spending a week at the team’s selection camp in Chula Vista, Calif.
Although cautiously op-
timistic about her chances of making the national team dur-ing the camp, Nelson remained as humble as ever about the experience of competing for a roster spot.
“All the pitchers here are 
so fantastic that I kind of feel 
like I’m at the bottom looking 
up,” Nelson said in a phone interview Thursday. “But it’s such an honor just to be here and to get to pitch to hitters like these.”
The selection camp was Nel-
son’s first time on the diamond since Washington swept UF in 
the Women’s College World 
Series championship series.“It’s kind of helped get my 
mind off the loss and every-thing,” she said. “That was a long week without softball. It’s nice to get back on the field again.”
Nelson struggled in her final 
three college games, giving up an uncharacteristic 10 earned runs while the Gators suffered their first back-to-back losses since March 31, 2007.
The bitter end to an other-
wise outstanding career fur-
ther motivated 
Nelson to prove 
herself dur-ing the selec-tion camp. By earning a spot on Team USA, 
Nelson joins an elite group of pitchers.
As it did in 2008, the nation-
al team will carry five pitchers: Nelson; Monica Abbott, who holds the NCAA records for the most wins and strikeouts; Katie Burkhart, the Most Out-standing Player of the 2008 WCWS; Cat Osterman, who is tied for sixth with Nelson in career wins (136); and Jennie 
Finch, arguably the most fa-
mous softball player ever.

The goal for the Gators was simple: 
win a national title.
After successful runs at the NCAA 
East Regional and the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships, the NCAA Out-door Championships was the last meet for both UF teams this season.
The Gators didn’t meet their desig-
nated goal.
Though the NCAA Championships, 
held in Fayetteville, Ark., may not have ended the way the Gators wanted, Hol-loway and the Gators did not walk away empty-handed.
The men’s track and field team tied for second with Florida State and Oregon, all with 46 points, and the women’s team placed ninth with 23 points. 
Texas A&M won both the men’s and 
women’s team titles.
“Our goal was to win a national cham-
pionship,” Holloway said. “Though we fell short of that goal, it has been a very 
successful season for both teams.”
Junior Mariam Kevkhishvili won the 
women’s shot put with a throw of 58-
4.50/17.79m. Kevkhishvili won this event 
at the NCAA Indoor Championships as 
well as the SEC Championship and the 
NCAA East Regional this season.

Before Billy Horschel’s first-ever PGA 
Tour event, he attempted to downplay 
the huge adjustment necessary to make 
the jump from college to professional 
golf.
“It’s just the same as my four years in 
college,” the former UF men’s golfer said. “Even though the level of play is higher, you are still playing the golf course.”
However, Horschel might have un-
derestimated some growing pains that come with a promotion to the profes-
sional ranks. This past weekend, he 
missed the cut in the St. Jude Classic and was eliminated after the second round 
with a score of 4 over par. 
After a first-round score of 1 over 
par, he struggled with his putting in the second round, shooting 3 over par and missing the cut by three strokes.
 UF men’s golf coach Buddy Alexan-
der acknowledged the acclimation peri-
od the former UF golfer will experience.
“Obviously he’s disappointed and I 
was disappointed for him, but I think it’s not totally surprising,” Alexander said. 
“That’s a different level. That’s a whole 
other ball game when you move up to play in PGA Tour events.”
But if Horschel wants some inspira-
tion, he will not have to look far. Former UF men’s golfer Camilo Villegas entered the PGA Tour in 2004 and missed the cut 
in his first event with a score of 9 over par. 
Now, according to Golfweek, Villegas is the 13th best golfer in the world. Also, 
former Gator Brian Gay won the St. Jude 
Classic by five strokes.Horschel misses cut in

season, 38.74 seconds. The team, consisting of 
Dennis Martin, Calvin Smith, Terrell Wilks and Jeremy Hall, won the event with a time of 38.58 seconds. The win, UF’s first 4x100m relay title since 2004, is also the school’s third-ever title in the event.
In addition to the 4x100m relay team and Kevkhishvili’s victories, UF earned a total of 22 All-America honors at the meet, topping last sea-son’s 21.
Smith, part of the 4x100 and 4x400 relay 
teams, earned three All-America honors during the NCAA Championships and now has 13 for his career.

As the final seconds of 
Game 5 ticked off the clock, it was a bittersweet 
moment.
While I had predicted a five-
game Lakers victory in the NBA Finals more than a month prior, 
it also marked a transition into 
one of the emptier portions of the 
sports calendar.
The neverending great sports 
moments of March, April and 
even May seem so far in the 
rearview mirror.
Baseball is now the only one 
of the four major sports still in progress.
(Don’t kid me that I’m sup-
posed to already start getting 
worked up about football season. 
UF’s two-a-days are still nearly two months away, and I couldn’t 
care less about preseason NFL ac-
tion.)
I’m also more of a Tampa Bay 
Rays fan than a true MLB fan, so now I just have one team to be 
passionate about, although thank-
fully they are trying to make this 
easy on me, having won their last 
five games.
But perusing the rest of the 
summer sports calendar is an ex-ercise in futility. 
Watching college baseball on 
television is 100 times worse than watching pro ball on TV, and 
that’s bad enough as it is.The end 
of June fea-
tures the NBA and 
NHL drafts. 
Not exactly triple-over-
time Bulls-
C e l t i c s 
games.
Wimbledon usually can carry 
the load for two weeks, but it 
looks to have lost its luster if Ra-
fael Nadal is hampered by a knee 
injury.
Don’t worry — there’s also 
several NASCAR Sprint Cup 
races. I mean, you couldn’t pay 
me to watch one of those, but I’m 
sure dozens of fans will be ea-
gerly sitting by their televisions somewhere.
So it looks like golf will be the 
saving grace.
While Tiger Woods’ perfor-
mance at last year’s U.S. Open is an experience that probably can’t 
be topped, watching the greatest 
golfer ever is always something 
I enjoy.  He will try to repeat at 
Bethpage  this weekend, and then the British Open and PGA Cham-
pionship will have to carry my 
non-baseball sports viewing for 
July and August.
It doesn’t look good.
C’mon Rays, my fate is in your 
hands.Sports fanatics face lull TrAck , from page 17

Former UF golfer Billy Horschel shot a combined 4 over par and missed the cut at the St. 
Jude Classic in Memphis, Tenn. It was his first PGA event.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Florida State University 
President T.K. Wetherell will tell the school’s 
trustees this week that he wants to retire.
Two school officials close to Wetherell told 
The Associated Press on Monday he will inform 
the trustees at the conclusion of its board meet-
ing Wednesday. They asked not to be named because they aren’t authorized to make the an-nouncement.
Wetherell said Monday he’s focused on his 
budget preparation for Wednesday’s meeting and didn’t want to discuss his personal plans.
He noted it’s routine for presidents to give a 
year’s notice to find a replacement.“And next year is 2010,” he said. “I’ll figure 
that out when I figure that out.”
The trustees, who want Wetherell to remain 
until a successor is chosen, 
plan a national search for a leader with a background that focuses on academics, the sources said.
A former star football 
player at Florida State, Weth-erell became president at his 
alma mater in January 2003.
Now 63, Wetherell has 
been treated for prostate cancer in recent years, 
but said he got a clean bill of health last week from doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville. FSU’s Wetherell to retire
“There is a certain learning 
curve and a certain comfort 
level that he will have to work 
on,” Alexander said. “He will 
learn from this and be better the next time out.”
According to Horschel’s 
Twitter page, the next time 
out might come in the Fort 
Smith Classic. He is currently 
attempting to qualify for the 
event, which is part of the 
Nationwide Tour, a devel-opmental tour for the PGA Tour. 
“For the first time, it’s his 
occupation, and he knows 
if he plays well and makes 
the cut it will lead to more 
exemptions and a PGA Tour 
card,” Alexander said.Next event may be Fort Smith ClassicOn Oct. 22, I was at Tropi-
cana Field for the Tampa 
Bay Rays’ first-ever World 
Series game. 
My friend, who generously of-
fered his family’s extra ticket to 
me, still pokes fun at me for the stupid grin I had on my face for the first eight innings of the game.
Sure, the Rays were on their way 
to a 3-2 loss, but I was just happy to be there — on that big of a stage, 
wondering how I even got there. 
Fittingly, over the next week, 
I watched my team look just as 
happy to be there as I had been, and the Rays came away with their first-ever World Series defeat, a 4-1 romp at the hands of the Phillies. 
Eight months later, as I watched 
Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles 
Lakers win Game 5 of the NBA Fi-
nals against the Orlando Magic, it all felt a little too familiar.
Not because Phil Jackson won 
his record 10th championship, not because Kobe won his fourth ring — celebrating it like Michael Jordan did, standing on stage and waving four fingers in the air — 
and not because Adam Morrison 
probably cried at some point.
It was because my team just 
looked happy to be that deep into 
the postseason, and for the second 
time in a year, a central Florida team full of young talent fell 4-1 in a championship series.
Neither team was predicted to 
even make it as far as they did. The Magic should have fallen to either 
the defending-champion Celtics or 
LeBron James and the Cavaliers, and the Rays were a classic worst-to-first story.
Like Carlos Pena and Evan 
Longoria, who went hitless in the World Series until Game 5, Dwight Howard and Rashard Lewis disap-
pointed in the Finals. 
Howard supposedly announced 
his presence as a superstar with his 
outstanding performance in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals, when he did what all the great players have done: put his team on his back and carried it to victory. 
Although he led all players in 
rebounds in four out of five Finals 
games, he was his team’s top scor-
er just once, matching Lewis’ 21 
points in Game 3, the Magic’s only 
win in the Finals.It was 
also the fran-
chise’s first 
champion-ship victory, breaking the curse of Nick “the Brick” 
A n d e r s o n , 
whose four 
missed free throws against the Houston Rockets in Game 1 of the 
1995 Finals forced Orlando to wait 
14 more years for its first win in a championship series, a short eight months after the Rays got theirs.
While the ultimate demise of the 
Rays and the Magic can be traced 
to a number of issues — a lack of 
experience, sub-par performances 
by their best players and key role 
players not stepping up, to name 
a few — both suffered from what I 
call a “championship moment in a 
non-championship game.”
For the Rays, I thought it was 
rookie pitcher David Price step-
ping onto the mound to close out 
Game 7 of the ALCS against the Red Sox. 
When Akinori Iwamura stepped 
onto second base for the final out, the resulting celebration was like that of a world champion.
For the Magic, it was the six-
game dethroning of King James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, capped off by Howard’s playoff career-high 40 points.
The best example of this con-
cept was Ali Gardiner’s walk-off grand slam against Alabama in the Women’s College World Series semifinals. It was such an emotion-al moment, such a high point for 
the team and its fans. It was like 
the climax of a story.
Unfortunately for all three 
teams, the subsequent falling ac-tion was finishing as a national runner-up.
When the unprecedented, mi-
raculous runs to the championship ended for the Magic and Rays, both immediately started to talk about next year. 
But with the Rays fighting to 
stay above .500 and the Magic po-tentially losing several key players to free agency, there’s another sim-
ilarity: They’ll both be even hap-
pier to be there if they find them-
selves back in the title hunt in the 
near future.Magic, Rays stories eerily 
similar after tough defeats

rooting you on when you’re pitch-ing and just being on the field with athletes I’ve heard about for years and years and years,” Nel-
son said.Although the players at the se-
lection camp were among the most 
talented in the nation, Nelson de-scribed the competition among the 41 athletes vying for roster spots as “more laid back than you’d 
think.”
“(The competition) doesn’t 
really carry over off the field be-cause everybody’s really nice 
here and being complimentary of everybody else’s skills,” Nelson said. “On the field, it’s a little bit laid back, but everybody’s trying to do their best.”
Softball is no longer an Olym-
pic sport, but Nelson and Team USA will compete in the Canada Cup in Surrey, B.C., and the World Cup in Oklahoma City in July.
With only eight returning play-
ers from the 2008 Olympic team, Nelson is part of a new generation of talent that will represent the 
U.S. in international competition 
through three different teams. 
Three other Southeastern Con-ference players were named to the national team with Nelson: Chel-sea Bramlett of Mississippi State and Ashley Holcombe and Brit-tany Rogers of Alabama.
The USA Softball Japan Cup 
team, a separate entity from the national team, will participate in the Japan Cup in Sendai, Japan.
Pitcher’s first international competition with overhauled squad will be Canada Cup in July
