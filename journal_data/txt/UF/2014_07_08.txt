Where Tent City once was now 
lie messily raked piles of debris. 
A worn path leads to the empty 
camping area, and bare patches 
of sand mark where many people 
called home. Birds still sing from the 
arching canopy of trees over piles of rain-sodden novels and robin’s egg blue porcelain dishes.
Today is when bright orange 
“No Trespassing” signs take effect. Tonight at midnight is when people on the land will be trespassing on the property. However, most of the campers have already moved out of Tent City over the past few weeks. 
“The ones that are left this late 
might be the ones who need the 
most help,” said Annette Gilley, an 
Occupy Gainesville member who has been actively helping Gaines-ville’s homeless. “They might be ad-dicted to drugs or mentally ill and 
haven’t wanted to move out.” 
Gainesville Police have been vis-
iting Tent City, telling campers of 
the eviction date and handing out ﬂ  yers with information about relo-cation opportunities, said GPD Lt. Brian Helmerson.
Those who are left will be verbal-
ly warned of trespass, then physi-
cally arrested or given a notice to 
appear in court. If they still do not leave, trespassers will be jailed.
Some have relocated to other campsites, and some have moved to 
the woods around GRACE Market-
place, about ﬁ  ve miles North.
“Every day, we have been having 
a slow inﬂ  ux,” said Theresa Lowe, executive director of the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry. “I know Tuesday is the last day, but there were a lot of people who didn’t want to move 
this way.”
To help with the move, the city 
approved 2,000 one-year bus passes 
for the ACCHH to give to those who need it. 
“Free bus passes have made it 
easier for people to get out to us,” she said. “And once they started moving out here, they found out that we are OK.”
Arupa Freeman, the founder of 
Homeless Outreach Mobile Effort (Home) Van, a service that brings necessities to the homeless, has fo-
cused her attention on fundraising 
for new tents to give to campers.

That puddle from Flori-
da’s frequent rain showers 
may not be as innocent as it appears. 
Mosquitoes containing 
the Eastern equine encepha-litis virus have been found in Alachua County, and small areas of standing water are their preferred breeding ground. 
Two horses contracted the 
virus in late June, and the Alachua County Health De-
partment recently released 
a mosquito-borne illness ad-visory to warn county resi-dents on July 1.
Eastern equine encepha-litis is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes that can in-fect humans and livestock. 
Symptoms may include fe-
ver, headache, dizziness, fa-tigue and confusion, accord-ing to the department.
Phillip Kaufman, associ-
ate professor of veterinary entomology at UF, said that horses tend to get hit by the virus ﬁ  rst and that human 
outbreaks are more likely to 
occur shortly after.
People are most at risk of 
being bitten by mosquitoes carrying the virus during the dawn and dusk hours, he said.
Kaufman said residents 
should use mosquito repel-
lents containing a chemical Mosquito-borne

Gainesville Police arrested a homeless 
man for hitting and spitting on two EMT res-
cue squad members on Bo Diddley Plaza on Saturday. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested and charged Peter E. 
Bergman, 55, on two counts of battery on an emergency medical care provider, according to a police report.
Bergman was found lying on his back 
with a large scratch and bruise on the back 
of his head due to a previous ﬁ  ght where he 
was knocked unconscious by a punch.   
When EMTs arrived to take Bergman to 
the hospital, he was asked questions to ﬁ  gure out his condition, according to the report. He said he couldn’t tell what time or day it was.    
Bergman kicked and swung his arms at a GPD ofﬁ  cer, Alachua County Fire Rescue Ser-vices and Gainesville Fire Rescue ofﬁ  cials while he was on a stretcher and struck a GFR technician in 
the shoulder and leg. 
After Bergman’s ac-
tions, an ofﬁ  cer placed 
him under arrest, accord-
ing to the report. Bergman then spat on an-other EMT. 
“Bergman required medical treatment due to his extreme level of intoxication,” GPD spokesman Ben Tobias wrote in an email.
Ofﬁ  cers later located and arrested Berg-
man back on Bo Diddley Plaza after being released from UF Health Shands Hospital, 
Tobias said.
“The initial ofﬁ  cer made the decision to 
hold the charges until after his release,” To-
bias said. 
Ofﬁ  cers booked Bergman into the Alach-
ua County Jail on Saturday at about 7:30 a.m.  As of press time, his bond is set at $5,000.   Police say drunk homeless man hit, kicked and spat at EMTsSEE HOMELESS, PAGE 4

“Unless they are military-grade tents, tents aren’t 
meant to be full-time residences,” she said. “We are try-
ing to get people a fresh start at their new locations.”
Tent City’s property owners allowed the campsite.“We started off with one homeless man, Old Rob-
ert,” said Larry Calton, owner of part of the land and the Calton Dental Ofﬁ  ce nearby. “Two or three years later, we had about 150 people living out there with no restroom facilities, all living on ﬁ  ve acres of land.”New residents kept coming, including a large inﬂ  ux 
from the property where the new Regional Transit Sys-tem facility is being built.
“In the group, there were quite a few nice people 
who were just down on their luck,” he said. However, other residents created an unsafe environment on the 
property, so they had to go. 
In the meantime, the homeless settle into their new 
camps. Trash is no longer scattered on the ground, but 
collected in big, black Hefty bags. Food roasts on open ﬁ  res. People rebuild their homes.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014

� 125 TEAMS COMPETED.
HANNAH FELL

Jonathan Nuñez couldn’t be 
happier to peel the large, white 
“10” off of his team’s race car and replace it with a “9.”
For the second year in a row, 
the UF Society of Automotive Engineers Formula Team has placed in the top 10 of the inter-national competition, out of 125 entrants.
This year, Gator Motor-
sports placed ninth in the For-mula SAE Michigan Competi-tion, up one spot from last year. 
The rules allow previous top 
10 winners to display the place they ﬁ  nished on their car.
“It means everything to us,” 
said Nuñez, the team captain of Gator Motorsports. “It means that we’ve succeeded.”
The team travels to one 
competition and builds a new 
formula vehicle, which is a fast, open vehicle, each year, the 
21-year-old UF chemical engi-neering senior said. 
“All the schools build them 
with a wide range of designs,” he said. “But every school adds different details to make theirs unique.”
UF’s formula vehicle has 
SAE brakes, which is an anti-lock braking system that allows the driver to hit the brakes as hard as he or she can to make 
the vehicle move faster.
David Kanner, president of 
Gator Motorsports, said that at 
the beginning of the year, the team sits down to decide on the next year’s car design.
The team is going to add a 
front wing to the vehicle next year to make it more aerody-
namic.
Next year’s goal is to replace 
the “9” with an “8.”
“It’s such an adrenaline 
rush,” he said,” but when it’s 
over, it’s so rewarding seeing everyone ﬁ  nish. It’s a great ex-perience.”Gator Motorsports 
places 9th in international race
Alachua County uses ‘sentinel chickens’ to test for pest viruses
called DEET because they are the most ef-
fective to use for long-term protection. 
He warns that while natural repellents 
work well, they are only useful in the short term.
“You have to keep applying them,” he 
said.
Peter Jiang, a Gainesville Mosquito 
Control entomologist, said the service’s main focus on preventing outbreaks is through larvicide, a measure that aims at killing mosquito eggs before they get the chance to develop.
The service will provide mosquito ﬁ  sh, 
which eat mosquito larvae, to Gainesville residents with ponds as a natural means to reduce the mosquito population.
“That’s one way you reduce using any 
pesticides,” Jiang said.
Jiang said Alachua County monitors 
viruses transmitted by mosquitoes using sentinel chickens in coops strategically located around the county. Sentinel chick-ens are used to test for viruses because the birds produce antibodies if they are bitten, and entomologists can determine the po-tential for an outbreak.  
Karen St. Pierre, a Gainesville Mosquito 
Control service technician, works on mos-quito traps set up by the service to monitor 
populations and test for viruses.
“Mosquito control begins in your back-
yard,” she said.
Anthony Dennis, environmental health director of the Florida Department of 
Health in Alachua County, said he advises people to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds that typically collect standing wa-ter, which include pots, buckets and other containers.
Dennis said while there hasn’t been a 
case involving a human contracting the vi-
rus in the past 20 years, it’s important to 
stay protected using repellent.
“There is no vaccine for humans to 
combat EEE,” Dennis said. “When we see the disease being transmitted, we take the opportunity to notify people.”

Imagine students completing 
their homework through a mas-
sively multiplayer online role play-ing game while the user adventures through a unique and exotic world.
UF professor Dennis Frohlich, 
who teaches the class The Cultural Impact of Video Games, said he’s never heard of such a thing.
Lindsey Tropf, a UF graduate 
student, wants to make that game a reality.
She is launching a Kickstarter on 
Thursday in hopes of raising $50,000 
to create the underlying mechanics 
of the game.
Tropf’s game, called Tyto Online, 
will have its own world, lore, story and epic mission. The first release will also contain a module of ecol-ogy set to middle school science standards.
Her Gainesville-based educa-
tional startup, Immersed Games, aims to develop a virtual world as a platform for learning opportunities. 
Grade school students will complete 
quests in subjects like science, math, entrepreneurship, history and finan-cial literacy. 
Tropf, a doctoral candidate in 
UF’s School Psychology Program, has dedicated more than 3,000 hours working with schools.
“I understand the practical limi-
tations of teachers if they were to want to implement our game in their classroom,” she said.
Tropf refers to existing educa-
tional video games as “chocolate-covered broccoli.” Developers make 
educational games like a worksheet 
of problems — the broccoli — but in a pretty game format — the choco-late.
“Answering a math problem to 
shoot a zombie, it’s fun and novel for a moment, but it isn’t true, deep learning and doesn’t teach the con-cepts,” Tropf said. “(It) just helps 
students practice them.”
Immersed Games was found-
ed on the premise that all content 
should be in one cohesive world where students are able to stumble upon quests for content they never may have known existed otherwise.
Frohlich said that kids know right 
away when a video game is trying to 
teach them something.
He said he is curious about Im-
mersed Game’s reasoning for using 
the genre of an MMORPG for an ed-ucational game and whether it will be effective.
“Minecraft has shown that online 
gaming can be a space for collabora-tion between players,” Frohlich said.

is a social problem
In 2006, Florida voters showed overwhelming support for 
Article X, a state constitutional amendment that granted funding for a comprehensive tobacco education and pre-
vention program. Article X would later birth Tobacco Free Florida, a hugely successful anti-tobacco campaign whose ads 
continue to make us cringe. If you haven’t seen the TV spots or 
billboards, the campaign uses graphic imagery — a girl drink-ing a beaker of formaldehyde, another girl peeling the skin from her cheek as payment for a pack of cigarettes and testimo-nials from cancer-stricken adults who were lifelong smokers — to drive home the message that a small action like smoking can harm yourself and others.
Today, Floridians are faced with a similar struggle to elimi-
nate a life-endangering habit from its citizens: texting while 
driving.
Like smoking, only weak, virtually unenforceable laws exist 
to prevent people from texting while driving. Like smoking, 
texting while driving not only hurts yourself — it hurts others around you. Like smoking, the issue of texting while driving is mired in politics as lawmakers argue that it’s not the gov-ernment’s duty to regulate behavior. Like smoking a cigarette, sending a text while driving is a tiny action with deadly con-sequences. Like smokers, people who text and drive know it’s 
dangerous, but they do it anyway. 
As the state examines the ways in which it can battle its tex-
ting-while-driving problem, it might help if politicians analyze 
the success of Tobacco Free Florida and apply the education-as-a-tool-for-change method toward texting at the wheel.
The Tampa Bay Times reported on Sunday that Florida’s 
texting-while-driving ban, which makes texting at the wheel a secondary offense, has resulted in just 1,800 citations during the ban’s ﬁ  rst year.
“To understand how meager a ﬁ  gure that is,” Times report-
er John Woodrow Cox writes, “consider: A federal study pub-lished last year found that at any given daylight hour, 660,000 drivers nationwide are using cellphones or other electronic devices.”
Because texting at the wheel is only a secondary offense, 
police can’t pull over a driver for having his or her phone out unless the driver is committing another offense — speeding, not using a seatbelt, etc.
Policy has failed when it comes to stopping Florida drivers 
from texting while driving. It’s time, then, to look at more effec-tive methods, and education campaigns such as Tobacco Free Florida have been proven to work.
According to Tobacco Free Florida’s website, “In 2012, the 
smoking rate of adults in Florida was 17.7%, well below the national average of 19.6%...The number of youth who have pledged never to smoke has increased from 55 percent in 2006 to 67.7 percent in 2013.”
It’s up to lawmakers to fund a Florida chapter of a cam-
paign like It Can Wait, AT&T’s national texting-and-driving prevention effort. Education campaigns are effective, and they’re worth the investment. Here’s to hoping that politicians and citizens recognize this and demand change.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Have you ever been to 
UF’s astronomy observatory? Today’s question: Do you take offense to gay slurs? NSA needs overhaul, culpability check
Two months ago, PBS’s “Frontline” chronicled the con-
ception of the National Security Agency and how the institution continues to affect our daily lives in a must-
see documentary called “United States of Secrets.” While watching this special, one automatically envisions the Or-
wellian future illustrated in “1984.” 
“Frontline” amassed a surprisingly diverse set of inter-
viewees for its documentary special. The pro-NSA camp 
was represented by former White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card and former NSA Chief Michael Hayden. In the opposition, journalist Glenn Greenwald, Department of Justice Attorney Thomas Tamm and a handful of NSA whistleblowers — not including Edward Snowden — cried foul over the practices 
of the agency. 
The prevailing theme of the pro-NSA side of the row is 
that security trumps all, even the rule of law. In order to ﬁ  nd 
threats against the homeland, the NSA collects data from citi-zens foreign and domestic. Everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  The NSA does not extinguish the ﬂ  ames of fear of another domestic terrorist attack — it ignites them.
The documentary started at the ﬁ  rst abuse of the NSA 
from the Nixon administration. Nixon used the agency to 
spy on his enemies. Once caught, he tamped down its pow-
er and sent it underground. No major news came from the agency until the aftermath of 9/11. The Bush administration called upon Hayden to outline steps, necessary under the cir-cumstances, that the agency could take in order to protect the country. Hayden successfully brought the president a plan of action that expanded the reach of his organization, a plan that collected data on friend and foe alike. 
What may be news to some is that in the NSA, a pro-
gram called ThinThread was scrapped in order to give way to Hayden’s plan. ThinThread anonymized the personal in-formation of people whom the NSA collected data on. Only when a court order was given could a suspect’s personal in-formation be revealed. ThinThread was discarded because (in keeping with the NSA’s argument) sweeping, legally gray action must be taken in order to protect America.  
One of the more rage-inducing moments of the documen-tary came from a standoff between Counsel Gonzales and Attorney General John Ashcroft. Ashcroft, now wary of the NSA, had to re-authorize the continuation of the 
NSA’s practices every 45 days. 
When he fell ill and was rushed to the hospital hours before the NSA needed his reauthorization, Gon-zales and Card, the agency’s two 
top advocates, rushed to his bed. Though in pain, Ashcroft told the two that he would not lend them his signature. 
In an act of illegal proportions, Gonzales, who had no 
right or authority to authorize the furtherance of the NSA’s 
practices, changed the reauthorization provision that was 
to be approved by the Attorney General so that it could be approved instead by Counsel Gonzales himself. And so the NSA’s rich history of recklessness continued. 
This documentary was an abject indictment of Michael 
Hayden. The “Chief Snoop” continually perpetuated false-hoods and half-truths to the American public. 
He lied to the public when he said that there were not in-
ternal apprehensions of data collection within his agency. He 
misled the public when he said that the agency does not spy 
on Americans. He and former President George W. Bush ne-glected to disclose the controversial aspects of the NSA dur-ing press conferences. Keep in mind that President Obama, despite his contradictory campaign rhetoric, continued the prying.                   
Which brings us to the present. According to the Wash-
ington Post, the administration hasn’t produced one instance of NSA records preventing terrorist attacks. 
The best way to continue on a path of constitutional and 
legal irresponsibility is to make the population fearful of the most alarmist and terrifying consequences of what could happen as a result of refusing to comply with their protec-tors. During these trying times, remember: “War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.”

Words have power. This 
power is the reason “f**k” needs to be cen-
sored. It’s the reason being called 
a “whore” hurts. It’s why phrases 
like “That’s so gay,” and “Don’t 
be such a f****t,” are offensive.
Slurs, especially gay slurs, are 
meant to hurt. Decades of oppres-
sion have made it so that these 
words were unacceptable to use. That is, until 
the gay community started reclaiming them.
A few months ago, I wrote an article about 
a queer porn star for one of my classes. My 
professor told me I needed to use a different 
word than “queer” because it’s a derogatory 
term.
I understood where he was coming from. 
Historically, “queer” has been used to degrade 
the gay community. 
But that same community has since re-
claimed the word “queer” in past years. Oh, 
and also, I identify as queer. This is an umbrel-la term for anything outside the “traditional” 
gender and sexuality binaries.
Explaining to my white-haired professor 
that my sexuality isn’t a derogatory term was 
a real eye-opener.
I began to notice more and more straight 
people tell me what I, as well as many of my 
gay friends, could and could not refer to my-
self as.
“Queer” is offensive, so I can’t say that. 
“Dyke” is offensive, too. Don’t even think about calling yourself a “f****t” because that is deﬁ  nitely derogatory.
I’m not saying that people shouldn’t point 
out uses of slurs and hate speech. But we run into a problem when straight people try to tell gay individuals which words they can and cannot use.
The same can be said for any oppressor 
and oppressed group.
Imagine a white person trying to correct an 
African-American individual on his or her use of the N-word. 
It’s admirable that you want to stop the 
use of slurs, but does that make it OK to stop a group from taking back a word that was his-torically used to degrade it?
We see this trend in pop culture, too. In “22 Jump Street,” Channing Tatum’s character, Jenko, takes a human sexuality class and realizes that he uses gay slurs.  
He later blows his cover to 
yell at some drug dealers about their use of these same slurs.
The problem with this is that 
Jenko isn’t a representation of 
the LGBTQ+ community. He 
doesn’t know what it is like to have insults like 
“f****t” thrown at him.
Some gay people have reclaimed words 
like “f****t”or “dyke.” Just like some women 
call themselves sluts, despite that word hav-
ing a negative connotation.
Reclaiming derogatory terms, a process 
called amelioration, is ﬁ  ne — if you are an 
individual whom those slurs have been used 
against.
It seems hypocritical, but it’s OK if we use 
those offensive words because those words 
have been used to hurt us, not you. 
But even the gay community must realize 
that words can only be reclaimed for oneself, 
not on behalf of the whole community. I can 
call myself “queer” and think of it as a positive term, but not everyone feels the same way.
For example, I have a gay friend who is not 
offended by the word “f****t, but he doesn’t 
use it out of respect for those who do ﬁ  nd it 
derogatory.
That’s the whole point of slurs: They’re of-
fensive. Words are powerful, especially words that have been historically used to oppress a community.
If you want to take a word that has been 
used to oppress you, like “queer” or “f****t,” and make it something positive, be my guest. But don’t pin that word on other people be-cause they might not feel the same way.
So if you hear a derogatory term, don’t be 
afraid to ask someone why he or she uses it. If it’s because that person is an insensitive jerk who doesn’t care about the feelings of others, feel free to call his or her s**t out.
But if it’s because that person has reclaimed 
a word to describe their sexuality — it’s not your place to stop them.

opinions@alligator.orgOn June 29, an older man 
in a red Jeep laid on his horn 
behind a Jimmy John’s bicy-cle deliverer on University Avenue. 
The driver sped down 
University around the cy-clist, who was riding in the lane once the light had turned green, close enough for the cyclist to touch the Jeep. 
Witnesses said the driver attempted 
to open his door onto the cyclist, intend-ing to push him off his bike onto the road, but the cyclist was focused on get-ting off of the main road.
The Jeep followed him.
Gunning it, the Jeep ﬂ  ew past the 
cyclist and swerved in front of him — 
slamming his brakes.  
That caused  the cyclist to crash into 
the back of the vehicle and ricochet off into the lane of oncoming trafﬁ  c, hitting another car before he fell off his bike and 
scraped his shoulder and back across the 
hot asphalt. The driver emerged from 
the Jeep and yelled at the cyclist but 
quickly silenced when he realized there 
were witnesses to his attempt on the cy-
clist’s life.
The driver walked away with a ci-
tation, attributing his episode to road 
rage.
The cyclist left the scene with hun-
dreds of dollars in damage to his bike 
that he bought with tips from happy col-
lege students, blood on his shirt, a lost shift and a trip to the emergency room.
And I got a call from the cyclist, my 
boyfriend of almost four years, with his 
steady voice telling me he had been as-
saulted by a vehicle but would be OK.
“What does OK mean?” I asked. Does 
he have internal bleeding? How fast can I get to him? Was he breaking any laws? Then:
Is he OK to ride his bike still? Will 
he still be able to pick me up and swing me around? Is his shoulder still strong enough to play tug-of-war with my Boston terrier, Buddy?
Luckily, he really is 
OK.
Road rage isn’t an 
excuse for trying to kill someone. And ignorance of road rules is not an ex-
cuse for road rage.
“The most basic right 
of all vehicle operators, including bicy-
clists, is that they are entitled to the use of the roadway.”
Flbikelaw.org outlines basic statutes 
of cycling laws from the Florida Leg-islature and offers easy-to-understand translations of the legal language.
Being entitled to the use of the road-
way has many responsibilities, a few 
being cyclists and drivers must obey all 
trafﬁ  c signals, if you intend to pass a ve-hicle, there must be enough clearance, (to pass a cyclist, there must be 3 feet 
between you and the bicycle) and both 
cyclists and drivers must move with the ﬂ  ow of trafﬁ  c.
But maybe the most relevant:“Bicyclists in narrow lanes are not 
required to keep right or ride single ﬁ  le, regardless of the presence of drivers de-
siring to go faster. (A) bicyclist must only 
move right and ride single ﬁ  le if the lane is wide enough to share.“ 
“A bicyclist remaining far to the right 
in a narrow lane is at risk of unwittingly encouraging drivers to attempt to un-
lawfully and unsafely pass within the 
lane.”
Gainesville is No. 37 on Bicycling.
com’s list of most bike-friendly cities. 
Keeping these statutes in mind can 
help make this community better and safer, but driving your more-than-4,000-
pound Jeep at a cyclist really just takes 
away from the magic of the ranking.
So that cyclist who is “in your way”? 
That cyclist has the same right to be on the road as you do.

JESSICA MARSH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andrew Selepak, director of the 
online master’s program in social 
media at UF, said his smartphone is always a reach away — a con-stant companion.   
“Without the phone, I’m giving 
up so much,” Selepak said. “It’s not just Candy Crush. It’s the most signiﬁ  cant way I communicate with people in the most meaning-ful ways. I can do so much with my phone that I can’t do with my laptop.” 
A recent survey by Bank of 
America Corp. said that 47 percent 
of Americans — just like Selepak 
— “couldn’t last more than one day without their smartphone.” 
The survey, “Bank of America 
Trends in Consumer Mobility Re-port,” published on June 30, ques-tioned 1,000 participants about their daily phone usage. 
Kara Watford, a 21-year-old UF health education senior, spends at least three hours a day surﬁ  ng the Internet on her smartphone. She said she uses her phone so often because her “computer sucks,” 
and her phone accesses the Inter-
net more quickly.       
The survey also said that Flor-
ida was the “least likely to adopt emerging technology.”
Selepak said the younger a per-
son is, and the more ﬁ  nancially se-cure, the more a person is lilkey to adopt a new technology. The survey found that 79 per-
cent of participants would give up alcohol or chocolate in order to get their phone back if it was taken un-
expectedly. 
Mitch Schafer, a 51-year-old 
high school teacher from New Port Richey, Florida, attending Pre-
view with his daughter, said he wouldn’t trade anything to get his cellphone back. 
“I’d go back to my Neanderthal 
ways,” he said.  
A portion of the survey results 
focused on the use of smartphones in managing ﬁ  nances. 
Regardless of how you use your 
phone, smartphones and other mo-bile technologies allow “the means to communicate on a grander scale with greater ease,” Selepak said.
Half of Americans say they can’t go a day without a smartphone
� THE RULING IS ON HOLD. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BOISE, Idaho — A U.S. Navy veteran 
ﬁ  led a civil rights lawsuit Monday after the 
Idaho State Veterans Cemetery refused to al-
low her to be buried with the ashes of her late wife.
Seventy-four-year-old Madelynn Taylor ﬁ  led the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Boi-
se after she tried to make advance arrange-
ments last year to have her ashes interred 
with Jean Mixner, whom she met on a blind 
date in 1995 and married in California in 2008 when gay marriage was brieﬂ  y legal.
Though federal veterans cemeteries al-
low the spouses of gay veterans to be in-
terred with their loved ones, Taylor said she 
was surprised to ﬁ  nd the Idaho cemetery does not.
The case was ﬁ  led as Taylor’s health is 
deteriorating. She has serious heart and lung 
problems and uses a cane, walker or scooter 
to get around. 
Taylor, for her part, was captivated by 
Mixner’s blue eyes. The two hit it off and it wasn’t long before Mixner moved from her 
Kansas City home to join Taylor in Nampa, 
Idaho. They soon married in a religious cer-emony during a church retreat in Oregon.
When Mixner got emphysema, they made 
a promise: Whoever went ﬁ  rst would be cre-
mated, then later buried with the other.
They chose the veterans cemetery because 
they knew it would be well maintained and 
decided on cremation and interment in a 
wall.
That ruling remains on hold while the 
state appeals the case to the 9th U.S. Circuit.Navy veteran sues after burial with gay partner is denied Survey: Americans 
can’t last more than one day without their smartphone “Without the phone, I’m

Three Gators named to award watch lists
Jeff Driskel was named to the Maxwell Award watch list 
on Monday. Dante Fowler, Jr. and Vernon Hargreaves III were named to the Bednarik Award watch list. Ryan Lochte will make his return to the pool this week at the Bulldog Grand Slam. Read the story on page 14.JORDAN MCPHERSON

On June 2, ESPN.com began a 
five-week unveiling of the top-50 
coaches in college basketball.
The website revealed No. 50-25 on the first day, and it contin-ued by revealing one additional coach each weekday.
The list started with St. Mary’s 
Randy Bennett and Baylor’s Scott Drew in a tie for No. 50.
It ended on Thursday with UF’s Billy Donovan on top.
The 49-year-old coach is joined 
on the list by Kentucky’s John Calipari, Michigan State’s Tom Izzo, Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski and Louisville’s Rick Pitino in the top five.
“After every year’s over with, 
I always take time and try to eval-uate myself, our team,” Donovan said after Florida’s 63-53 loss to UConn in the Final Four on April 5. “The number one question I ask myself every year is, did our team play as close as possible to 
their potential? Maybe more so 
than any team that I’ve coached based on the talent level, we played way beyond our potential as a team.”
The honor comes after Dono-
van led the Gators to a 36-3 over-all record last season, which in-cluded a 30-game win streak and 
a perfect record against South-
eastern Conference opponents.
He led a team that at the start 
of the season was riddled by inju-ries, illness and suspension to the Final Four for the first time since winning back-to-back national championships in 2006 and 2007.
“I think that we have been a 
team where the whole has been better than the parts,” Donovan said. “When you break us down individually, we’re not the most talented group, but when you stick us together collectively, we’re really good.”
During that stretch, Donovan 
saw Casey Prather, who aver-
aged 3.1 points per game in his 
first three years, explode for 13.8

Despite everything Scottie 
Wilbekin has accomplished 
throughout his basketball 
career, none of it guarantees 
him an NBA roster spot. 
The for-
mer Florida 
point guard 
is attempt-
ing to prove himself on the big-
gest stage 
through Or-
lando’s NBA summer league with the Memphis Grizzlies, 
but it’s been an unfamiliar 
situation.
Since going undrafted 
in last month’s 2014 NBA Draft, Wilbekin has played 
two games and is averaging 
one point, 3.5 assists and 1.5 rebounds.
Compare that to his first 
two games for Florida com-ing off a suspension last sea-son when he averaged 9.5 points and 7.5 assists, Wil-bekin hasn’t shown an im-
mediate impact like he has in 
the past.
On Sunday, Wilbekin said 
that there’s a lot of talent and 
that it’s definitely notable out 
there on the court, according to the Orlando Sentinel, .
“It’s a bit of an adjustment getting used to the minutes, because everybody on all of 
the teams here (have played) 
more than they do here,” Wilbekin said.
Wilbekin is fifth on the 
Memphis squad averag-
ing 17.5 minutes, and has 
started one of his two games played.
Although playing on a 
higher level and not seeing his senior-like numbers at Florida (13.1 points), Wil-bekin is flourishing in certain areas.
It isn’t always about sta-
tistics and Wilbekin has con-tinued to prove and display his basketball IQ.
Grizzlies’ summer-league 
coach Shawn Respert said Wilbekin plays with a pace that he thinks is healthy for a successful basketball team, according to the Orlando 
Sentinel.
“He’s going to be a guy 
that if you look in our league 
six or seven years down the road, he’s going to be an im-
portant part of a team that’s 
winning,” Respert said.
Respert added that he’s 
really proud of how Wilbekin 
has handled himself and that 
the former UF point guard is going to be very successful.

Florida’s wide receiving corps was ar-
guably the weakest position on the entire 
Gator football team last season. 
They finished 2013 ranked 116th in pass 
yards per completion — a statistic that can be attributed to the instability at quarter-back — but a glaring number nonethe-
less. Pair that with a recent coaching staff change due to alleged recruiting violations 
committed by Joker Phillips, new wide re-
ceivers coach Chris Leak has some devel-
opment to get out of his wideouts.
This season, Florida has a talented crop 
of receivers that can make plays in space — one of the core objectives of Kurt Roper’s 
new offense. AlligatorSports breaks down 
the position depth and projects the starters to find out who just might take everyone by surprise this year.Redshirt senior Quinton Dunbar, bar-
ring injury, will start in 2014. Entering the 
year as a senior, he has started in 25 games 
and has seen action in 38. 
You can check ex-
perience off the list for Dunbar, but his 
upside doesn’t stop 
there. Dunbar was the team leader in yards 
per reception last season, averaging 14 yards per catch.  A lot of that yardage was gained after the catch — some of Dunbar’s greatest plays last year came on second 
efforts to gain yardage off of one-on-one 
match ups. Dunbar will have to take on the leadership role for the unit this season.
Two players who had pleasantly sur-
prising springs were Latroy Pittman, Jr. 
and Valdez Showers. Combined, the two 
have seen action in just 41 games, but they have the skillset to be valuable options for The worst will be first: Breaking down UF’s wide receivers “. . . Donovan has been 
so relentlessly good that 
even the most stubbornly 
disinterested alum can’t help 
but sit up and take notice.”

ATHENS, Ga. — Michael 
Phelps and Ryan Lochte will re-
sume their comebacks during a special meet at the University of Georgia this week.
The Bulldog Grand Slam will 
feature some of the top teams in the country, including Phelps’ North Baltimore Aquatic Club and Lochte’s SwimMAC Carolina team based in Charlotte.
Phelps, who has captured a 
record 18 Olympic gold medals in his career, will be competing for the fourth time since coming out of retirement. Lochte is set to return to racing after having complications with his surgically repaired left knee.
The meet, hosted by the Athens 
Bulldog Swim Club at Gabrielsen 
Natatorium, was hastily arranged 
in the past few months to give the top U.S. swimmers a chance to take part in another event this summer before the two more im-portant competitions of the year. The national championships will be held in Irvine, California, from Aug. 6-10, followed two weeks 
later by the Pan Pacific Champi-
onships in Australia.
Those meets will determine the 
U.S. team for next year’s world championships in Russia.
Phelps is scheduled to compete 
in the 100-meter butterfly Friday, the 100 backstroke Saturday, and the 100 freestyle Sunday. Lochte 
has entered the same three events, 
as well as four other races. But it is doubtful the 11-time Olympic medalist will compete in them all coming off knee surgery late last year, especially after his initial comeback was derailed by pain and swelling.
Lochte was injured in Novem-
ber when an exuberant teenage fan ran at him. The swimmer tried to catch her, the two fell over and Lochte hit his left knee on a curb, tearing one ligament and sprain-ing another.
He returned in April for an 
Arizona meet, but pushed himself a little too hard and had to sit out the final two Grand Prix meets of the season.
The Athens meet will be an im-
portant test of how well Lochte’s knee holds up, especially if he does the breaststroke. He has en-tered the 200 individual medley, which includes the breast.
Phelps retired after the 2012 
London Olympics, but returned to training last year. He has been steadily building his endurance through competitions and a gru-eling training session in the Colo-rado mountains.
Two weeks ago at a Grand Prix 
meet in Santa Clara, he tied for 
first in the 100 fly, finished second 
in the 100 free and 200 free, and settled for third in the 200 IM.
Lochte attended the University 
of Florida from 2002 to 2006 as a member of the men’s swimming program under coach Gregg Troy. The former 24-time All-American finished first all-time in UF his-
tory in 12 different events by the 
time he graduated.
During his tenure in 
Gainesville, Lochte recorded doz-ens of awards including NCAA Male Swimmer of the Year twice. The Daytona Beach native also was a seven-time NCAA cham-pion and seven-time Southeastern 
Conference champion at Florida.
In three summer Olympic 
games (Athens, Beijing, London), 
Lochte earned 11 Olympic med-als, seven of which were individ-ual honors. The 29-year-old has 
74 total medals throughout his 
career in major international com-petitions.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014

Last week, alligatorSports pre-
sented the best individual perfor-
mance awards for the 2013-2014 season. You can see the results of the poll below. This week, alliga-torSports gives you the third in-stallment of the Alligator Awards: Best UF team.
The ﬁ  nalists have been nar-
rowed down to four squads, but you can choose the No. 1 team by voting online at alligator.org/sports. Check back next week for the ﬁ  nal results.
Softball (55-12, 15-9 Southeast-
ern Conference): Florida started its season on Feb. 6 and stayed un-defeated in its ﬁ  rst 25 games. The Gators’ versatile pitching staff — led by senior right-hander Hannah Rogers — and the nation’s No. 17 defense helped bring coach Tim Walton success throughout the 
year. 
The 2014 season will go down as 
one of the best in the program’s his-
tory after Florida defeated Alabama in the Women’s College World Se-ries to earn its ﬁ  rst national title.
Gymnastics (15-2, 6-1 SEC): The 
reigning national champions start-ed the 2014 season on a strong note. Even with Ashanee Dickerson, Ma-rissa King and Randy Stageberg gone, the youthful squad stepped up to earn a second straight title. 
It wasn’t just a dominant post-
season that made the Gators stand-out in 2014. Florida’s seven perfect scores in vault, ﬂ  oor and balance beam garnered national attention before the team arrived in Birming-ham, Ala., for the NCAA Champi-onships. A clutch performance by sophomore Bridgette Caquatto on the ﬂ  oor sealed Florida’s tie for ﬁ  rst with Oklahoma in the ﬁ  nal meet of the year.
Men’s Basketball (36-3, 18-0 
SEC): The Gators won 30 straight games en route to a Final Four ap-
pearance after failing to advance 
past the Elite Eight for the previ-ous three seasons. Florida set a Southeastern Conference record by ﬁ  nishing league play 18-0 — a difﬁ  cult feat when facing Kentucky twice in the regular season. 
Scottie Wilbekin’s ball move-
ment combined with Will Yeg-uette’s defensive pressure, Michael Frazier’s three-point shooting and Patric Young’s rebounding made Florida a force to be reckoned with in the NCAA Tournament. Al-though the Gators didn’t ﬁ  nish the 
year with a national title, they did 
make a Final Four appearance for the ﬁ  fth time in Florida history.
Lacrosse (18-3, 6-0 American 
Lacrosse Conference): After grad-uating 12 seniors in 2013, Florida looked to 2014 as a year of rebuild-ing with 11 new players on the ﬁ  eld. However, Florida ended conference play undefeated despite the lack of experience. The Gators won their fourth straight American Lacrosse Conference regular-season title, second conference tournament title and made a fourth straight NCAA 
Quarterﬁ  nals appearance. 
Next season, Florida will still 
be ﬁ  ghting to be the No. 1 seed, 
but coach Amanda O’Leary and company will have to do so in their new conference: The Big East.

He saw Scottie Wilbekin, who was 
suspended on two different occasions during his UF tenure for violation 
of team rules, mature and become a 
leader both on and off the court.
He saw Patric Young develop 
on both sides of the ball, pacing the Gators with 101 offensive rebounds and 41 blocks while setting a career high by averaging 11 points per game in 2014.
He saw Will Yeguete, the team’s “glue guy,” ﬁ  nd his niche in the starting lineup while having career 
bests in minutes per game (23.3), free 
throw percentage (.663) and assists per game (1.2). 
“Florida is one of the nation’s elite 
college basketball programs,” ESPN.com writer Eamonn Brennan wrote in the concluding piece of the series. “It is a perennial recruiting destination, a near-constant winner. Florida is, 
and always will be, a football school. 
Attendance hasn’t always been great. But Donovan has been so relentlessly good that even the most stubbornly disinterested alum can’t help but sit up and take notice.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 8, 2014

quarterback Jeff Driskel. Showers, 
a versatile athlete, played corner and running back in high school. 
He was on the running back 
depth chart last season, but moved to wideout this spring, where he performed well for his 
ﬁ  rst time at the position. Showers 
showed good speed and emerged as a consistent target during prac-tices.
Pittman saw a lot of action as 
a true freshman in 2012, where he played in all but one game, and earned a start on the road against Vanderbilt. His sophomore year 
he ﬁ  lled a backup receiver role, 
getting just nine games of playing time. 
He has just four catches in his 
career but will see those numbers 
increase if he picks up where he 
left off from spring. Pittman and Showers are each expected to ﬁ  ght for the No. 2 receiver spot coming into fall camp.
Sophomore Demarcus Robin-
son should be able to secure the third receiver spot, and he will be the unit’s x-factor this season — if he can keep himself out of trouble. 
Robinson was suspended twice 
during his true freshman season, and as a result saw action in just seven games. 
The Gators are hoping the  
benchings helped give him some maturity, as he proved to be an explosive target throughout spring. Robinson caught a 31 yard 
touchdown pass in the Orange 
and Blue Debut as well.
 If Robinson can keep himself 
on the ﬁ  eld, he is primed for a 
breakout season in 2014.
Redshirt senior Andre Debose 
was granted a sixth year of eligi-
bility in March, but did not par-ticipate in full contact this spring, as he was still rehabbing a torn ACL that kept him off the ﬁ  eld entirely in 2013. 
He has shown ﬂ  ashes of po-
tential at wide receiver, but has yet to live up to his No. 2 overall ranking he was given in the 2009 recruiting class. 
UF is hoping 2014 is the year 
Debose gets somewhere close to his admittedly lofty expectations.
Ahmad Fulwood, Chris 
Thompson and Raphael Andrades will likely get reps this season as well. With a unit as deep as Flori-da’s there are plenty of catches to go around.
Moral Stephens, C.J. Worton 
and Ryan Sousa round out the 2014 signees. Given the depth Florida has at receiver, all three 
could end up redshirting, but 
Sousa’s size (6-foot, 189 pounds) might give him the edge to see action early.
POSITION , from page 13DONOVAN , from page 16UK coach John Calipari 
ranked No. 2 in ESPN list Wilbekin averages 17.5 minutes 
guard has always been relentless defen-
sively with full-court presses and sacriﬁ  c-ing his body, and he has continued to show 
that throughout the summer league.
The undrafted free agent has continued 
to apply those principles as summer-league 
teammate and former Tennessee power for-
ward Jarnell Stokes has noticed.
Stokes gives Wilbekin the nickname of 
“Tennessee killer,” after Florida defeated 
Tennessee three times last season. Stokes said he is also glad to be Wilbekin’s team-
mate instead of an opponent.
Stokes said Wilbekin makes his job as a 
big man a lot easier on defense because of 
Wilbekin’s quick feet.
Receiving some praise after what he has 
performed thus far from coaches and team-mates, the former Gator is in a greater posi-tion than he was after draft night.
But what can make things even better 
is if he can perform at an exceptional level 
with more minutes.
According to the Grizzlies, shooting 
guard Jordan Adams, who was the team’s 
ﬁ  rst-round pick, signed a multi-year agree-ment Monday.
With Adams secur-
ing a spot on the Griz-zlies roster, Wilbekin may have a better 
chance at showcasing 
his abilities in the ﬁ  nal two summer league 
games in Orlando before heading out for a stint with the Philadelphia 76ers.
Wilbekin is scheduled to play against 
Orlando today at 3 p.m. He will then play on July 10 against Houston at 7 p.m.NBA , from page 13
