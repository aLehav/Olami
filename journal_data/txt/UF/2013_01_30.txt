Where did you sleep Monday night?
That was the question asked by volunteer 
surveyors Tuesday during the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry’s annual Point-in-Time homelessness census.
From 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. Tuesday , volunteers 
collected personal information from homeless people around the North Central Florida region, according to a coalition press release.
Nate Phillips, 40, was one of the about 200 vol-
unteers trained to work the survey . This was his second year participating.
Phillips said he has been homeless for about 
two years by choice.

UF has increased emphasis on drawing 
more qualiﬁ  ed science, technology, engineer-
ing and math majors into the teaching ranks. The most recent incentive, announced Mon-day , is a $1.2 million grant from the National Science Foundation for STEM EduGators.
The NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholar-ship Program funds students with STEM majors who pursue a teaching credential and commit to teaching at least two years in high-needs public school districts, according to a university press release.
“The appeal of the Noyce scholarships 
should recruit and retain more STEM ma-jors into the teaching ﬁ  eld with the skills and knowledge necessary to make an impact in high-needs school districts,” Dimple Flesner, the co-principal investigator of STEM EduGators, wrote in an email.
Throughout the next 
ﬁ  ve years, the NSF-backed effort will award scholar-ships worth $10,000 each to 
50 undergraduate students enrolled in UFTeach, which recruits the university’s best 
students to teaching through supervised class-room experiences in high-poverty schools.
“I think that the scholarship program is just another example of how UF is beating the state in education,” said Tom Dana, the princi-pal investigator of STEM EduGators.
The UFTeach program, for graduating se-
niors, is based on a collaboration between the colleges of education and liberal arts and sci-ences.
“The senior year is difﬁ  cult because the 
ﬁ  eld experience demands signiﬁ  cant time and attention,” Flesner said. “The Noyce scholar-ships will allow the students to focus on their apprenticeship and allay any ﬁ  nancial con-cerns.”

UF’s Hough Graduate School of Business provides some of 
the best specialized masters programs in the world, according 
to Eduniversal, a French-based university ranking agency.
Among U.S. public universities, seven of UF’s programs 
placed in the top 10.
The Thomas S. Johnson Master of Science in Entrepreneur-
ship program ranked No. 3 among U.S. public universities, No. 8 nationally and No. 30 worldwide.“I think it has a lot to do with the innovative and unique 
approach that we bring to the delivery of our program,” said Jamie Kraft, director of the Center for Entrepreneurship & In-novation. “I’m certainly very pleased. It’s always great to get recognition.”
The Master of Arts in International Business and the Master of Science in Management both ranked No. 4 among U.S. pub-lic universities.
Other programs that ranked highly among U.S. public uni-
versities include the Master of Accounting and Master of Sci-ence in Marketing, both at No. 9, and Master of Arts in Eco-nomics  and the full-time Master of Business Administration, both at No. 10.
Eduniversal takes three broad criteria into consideration 
when compiling the rankings: reputation of the program, sal-ary of ﬁ  rst employment and satisfaction of the students, ac-UF business school programs take worldwide top rankingsSEE HOMELESS, PAGE 4

“It’s not an easy program,” said Jane McNulty, asso-
ciate director for the Master of Science in Management 
program. “The same professors are teaching the first-year MBA students, so they are getting a very high-quality edu-cation.”
In an attempt to help students find jobs, the programs 
emphasize finding a lasting career after graduation.
“There is a big push for professional development to 
prepare students to enter the workforce, and I think that’s a very different model to other programs on campus,” said Ana Portocarrero, director of the Master of Arts in Inter -
national Business and Master of Science in Management programs.
Cecelia Hardwick, a 22-year-old graduate student in 
the management program, said she’s satisfied with her ex-perience in the program. 
“I’m not surprised by the ranking at all,” she said. 
“They’ve done a great job, and they’ve put a lot of focus on finding a career after school.”
Selcuk Erenguc, senior associate dean and director of 
the Hough Graduate School of Business, said the combina-tion of factors makes the program unique.
“When you put together world-class faculty, outstand-
ing students and state of the art curriculum, what you get is an excellent program,” he said.
Kraft said he believes that as much as ranking agencies 
weigh other metrics, it ultimately boils down to students.
“At the end of the day, our success is driven by the suc-
cesses our students bring to the marketplace,” he said.did in 2012 because volunteers were limited to two-hour surveying shifts, he said. Last year, he volunteered for eight hours.
He said he chose to help again be-
cause he “could use a couple bucks.”
Theresa Lowe, director of the 
Gainesville/Alachua County Office on Homelessness, said the surveyors were paid $10 an hour.
Locally , volunteers conducted 
surveys at the Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza, St. Francis House and “Tent City,” a homeless camp in southeast Gainesville, Lowe said. They also can-vassed through wooded areas where small pockets of people may have been living.Some of those areas are secluded in 
a way that people walk by them every day and don’t notice people live there, she said.
The survey is required by the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development in order to determine the coalition’s funding needs, Lowe said.
It also documents the status of 
homelessness for local policy makers, assists in local planning efforts, as-sesses local homeless needs and helps educate the public about homelessness, according to the release.
The survey helps the Alachua 
County School Board gauge the extent of homelessness among students’ fami-lies, Lowe said.
In 2012, 2,094 homeless people were 
counted. 
Overall, the survey found that 
homelessness increased about 18 per -
cent throughout North Central Florida, according to the coalition website.
The survey also found that most 
homeless people are men who can’t find work that pays a living wage. Thirty percent of homeless people are impaired by health problems, accord-ing to the 2012 survey.
With the conclusion of the 2013 
survey Tuesday night, Lowe said the results will be sent to HUD, Florida De-partment of Children & Families and other agencies and released in mid-February.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2013

Texting someone over the phone requires a number. An 
email on the computer needs an address.
But Eric Pheterson is taking it one step further by creating 
a website that allows users to anonymously send messages to 
cars by only knowing its license plate number.
Pheterson, a 24-year-old UF graduate and CEO of GOOD 
Inc., released TXT TAG earlier this year as a website that part-ners with local towing companies to let people know their cars were towed.
“I know they would never text you instead of towing you,” 
he said. “But I was thinking at least ... they could text you and say , ‘Hey , I have your car. Here’s the phone number, and here’s the location.’”
While TXT TAG isn’t the first service of its kind — other apps and websites, such as Plateside and CurbTXT, operate with the same purpose — it requires the least amount of per -
sonal information, Pheterson said.
Users can claim their tags to receive email notifications if 
they’ve been “texted.” They can opt out of membership and scroll through the website to see if they’ve received any mes-sages. If this option is chosen, anyone can view messages sent to an unclaimed tag.
Pheterson said the service is in its early stages and is cur -
rently going through testing in Gainesville.
For now, users can send custom messages to anyone in the U.S. Pheterson said when the service becomes more active, us-ers will be able to reply using preset messages.
He added this feature will remove the “creep factor’” and 
put his service apart from its competitors.
With the new service, some students are wary of having 
other people message them by knowing their license plate number.
Meehan Donovan, a 20-year-old UF plant science sopho-
more, said the service could be useful for the towing compa-nies but added she wouldn’t use it herself.
“I don’t know if I would feel comfortable with somebody 
contacting me with just my license plate number,” she said.
Laurence Kidd, a 20-year-old UF international studies soph-
omore, agreed.
“If you could just see someone driving by and then get on-
line and be talking to them, you could be harassing people out of nowhere,” he said. “It could lead to so many possibilities.” New license plate messaging service pilots in Gainesville

For eight months, caregivers at 
the Carson Springs Wildlife Conser-
vation Foundation have taken care of what they thought was a female Eurasian lynx.
But after now-9-month-old Zena 
went through a physical exam with a veterinarian last month, Christine Janks and Barry Janks, founders of the northwest Gainesville sanctuary, located at 8528 E. County Road 225, made a surprising discovery about the feline: she is actually a he.
Christine Janks said a week after 
Zee was born, caregivers had trouble determining his gender because his mother was protecting him.
As Zee lived on the sanctuary, 
Christine Janks said the lynx’s sex was never questioned by caregivers.
“We all assumed Zee was a fe-
male as he got older, and lots of fur covered his private parts,” she said.
Christine Janks renamed Zena to 
Zee after they determined the feline was actually born a male.
Dana Johnson, a 27-year-old UF 
biology senior and volunteer at the sanctuary, said she helped raise Zee, and took care of him when he was sick.
Johnson said she wasn’t bothered 
by the gender mix-up.
“It was more humorous than any-
thing negative,” she said.WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A bill to reform Student 
Government election codes 
was absent from the Student Senate agenda Tuesday night after being held last week.
Senators were confused 
about who would hear the bill. The author, Sen. Morgan Vollrath, thought it would be discussed by the Senate on Tuesday.
However, Senate Presi-
dent Christina Bonarrigo said she thought the bill was to be held for the temporary committee that would reform election codes.
At last week’s meeting, 
Bonarrigo announced her plan to form the temporary committee. 
The committee has not 
been established yet because she is still looking for mem-bers.
Senators listened to last 
week’s audio recording to determine when the bill would be heard again.
The bill, which made cam-
paigning codes more specif-ic, is expected to be on next week’s meeting agenda. It includes more strict language regarding individual actions 
during cam-paigns.
“I expect 
my bill to be back on the agenda next week,” he said. “I’m giving them 
a chance to do it right.”
The Senate also unani-
mously approved three bills Tuesday night. One bill re-moved the second-year clas-sification requirement of the two law students required to serve on the Election Com-mission, and two bills called for at least 48 hours notice for executive cabinet and su-pervisor of election appoint-ments.

OPINIONS EDITORFriday’s question: Did you change your 
driving habits after last year’s I-75 crash? 34% YES
66% NO
61 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Do you go to the library to study?
Do I really have a right? Part Two
In last week’s column, I drew upon the writings and ideas 
of various libertarian thinkers to synthesize and summa-rize a brief, and certainly not holistic, explanation of how 
we arrive at a theory of rights.
In that column, I concluded that man owns himself and, 
by extension, can lay claim to all previously unowned prop-erty with which he has mixed his labor. He not only owns the land but also the fruits of that land. He can engage in voluntary trade by exchanging his labor, his services or the products of his land for other goods, services or money.
Furthermore, any aggression against a person or his 
property violates that person’s rights. Therefore, man has the freedom to pursue whatever ends he chooses so long as he does not initiate force against another person.
So how do all of our other rights extend from this theory 
of property rights?
To illustrate, let’s use the right to keep and bear arms.If we own ourselves and our belongings, then in order 
to exert absolute ownership over these things, we must be given the ability to defend them from aggression. For the state to prohibit someone from acquiring the means to pro-tect themselves, it has asserted partial ownership over that person.
The right to keep and bear arms is a right to self-defense.Therefore, when someone claims they have a right to 
something, like education or health care, it is necessary to ask whether such a right violates the principles discussed above.
Does a right to health care violate the rights of others?It certainly does.For one thing, health care is not a magical service that can 
be provided at will with no associated costs.
A right to health care violates the property rights of health 
care practitioners by demanding they offer their services, an extension of their self-ownership, to anyone and everyone who needs it, eliminating all just and voluntary transactions. Instead, a right to health care institutes a system of inden-tured servitude.
Furthermore, a right to health 
care also violates the property rights of the taxpayers because it requires, in order to subsidize care for those who cannot afford it, agents of the state to initiate force against its citizens to collect the funds necessary for these sub-
sidies.
The same principles apply when someone argues for the 
right to education or the right to a living wage. In each case, the government must aggress upon the rights of all individ-uals to establish these rights. 
Therefore, we can arrive at a general principle about de-
termining the validity of rights.
A claim about rights is only valid if such a claim does not 
require the state, its agents or other individuals to violate the rights of others through the initiation of force.
But this discussion of rights helps further explain the ills 
of a growing government.
When arguing for or against certain government inter-
ventions, it is often not enough to cite statistics about the unintended consequences of those policies.
For every statistic one cites to argue against state inter-
vention, statists will probably have three more to counter those arguments.
Proponents of a larger state also frequently share a sad 
story about someone who beneﬁ  ted from said policy to pull at the heart strings.
However, without an emphasis on the ethical implica-
tions of government intervention, facts and ﬁ  gures will never reveal the true aggressive and immoral nature of an expansive state.

munication. His column appears on Wednesdays.Textual Harassment: 
We’re telling you 
otherwise
Have you read the newest newsletter in town? The Son 
Papers recently hit the streets of Gainesville with a bang.
The weekly newsletter aims to “share the truth of God’s son, 
Jesus Christ” with our community. It will apparently stop at nothing until we acknowledge its existence. If you haven’t seen them, then we’re a little surprised, because they keep trying to shove themselves down our throats. For many weeks, the assis-tant director contacted the opinions editor of the Alligator with mailed letters.
He started sending them, however, during the winter break 
between last semester and this semester, so no one read his cor-respondence until we got back into the ofﬁ  ce.
Since then, we’ve received many more letters. He invited us 
to submit weekly pieces on the preordained topics. The only way to say “no thanks” was to call, text or reply by letter. He didn’t do email at the time.
“Anyway, we’re going to continue to share our version of the 
truth,” wrote the only representative of the Son Papers who con-tacted us. “We’ll continue to run the ‘World Series of Truth’ and you guys will lose each issue by forfeit.”
Pardon our French, but how the hell is that fair? Or normal?Let’s create a hypothetical situation. It’s a few months before

that date, you’re led to assume that only those who have replied to say they will be at your wedding will physically be there. Anyone who did not reply will either not be there or will not have a name card, so they might as well not even show up.
We didn’t agree to the “challenge” from the Sons Papers. We never replied. We already have our own section of a 
newspaper dedicated to stating our opinions; you’re reading it right now. When we didn’t respond after some time, the news-letter started to print results of its “poll,” which asks readers to contact the newsletter with their choice of who wrote their “fa-vorite version of the truth.”
In a letter from earlier this month, we were reassured that 
“only those who have seen the introductory issue will know what’s going on, and that’s not a lot of people.”
Whoever your readers are, dude, they’re smart. They haven’t 
voted for your opponent. Because your opponent is the Alliga-tor, a newspaper that doesn’t have time to also write your news-letter for you. While we’re at it, you can stop using our racks to promote your newsletter. We’ve had too many issues with those racks to just let someone else share the ones we have left.
Stop physically attaching copies on or near our ofﬁ  ce.“When I was in the Marine Corps, they taught us in radio

God bless them. 
There’s always one in every 
article’s comment sec-tion.
I was reading 
through articles about 
how women can now serve in combat units in the military , and, as always, people are hashing out their differences in the comments section. As people argue that this is a bad idea because women would be raped in prisoner-of-war situations or that this new rul-ing would cause training standards to drop, I can always count on there being one guy who says, “And those hormones. Am I right, guys? Who wants to deal with all those women when they’re on their periods?”
I have nicknamed him the period guy. He is my 
favorite. I get the mental image of a dude sitting behind his computer and waiting for the Internet equivalent of bro-style high ﬁ  ves.
I am always comforted by the period guy be-
cause, in a world where sexism has become a mul-tiheaded beast that’s hard to identify and even harder to conquer, he will always exist as a shining example of lack of subtlety.
It’s always a blow to the ego when you realize 
your demographic hasn’t exactly progressed as far as you hoped it would have. It’s 2013 after all, right? Here I was thinking there were deﬁ  nitely minority groups that were needier in the civil rights depart-ment than I am, and then something like the com-bat debate hits the courts, and I’m kicked off my social justice pedestal as I watch people go back to arguing about the rights of women.
It always serves as a reminder that change is a 
long, arduous process that will never happen with-out some kicking and screaming along the way.
I should be glad, at least, that the argument over 
gender equality has gone from broad situations to more speciﬁ  c ones nowadays. Women serving in the military is now a bygone issue. It has been nar-rowed down to them serving in combat units. We are getting there surely enough, but it still seems to be taking a while.
To be honest, I am really looking forward to 
seeing how this plays out in the next couple of years. I believe if the standards for combat train-ing are unchanged, combat units will have to deal with women coming into their ranks. There may not be many women who make the training cut or decide the beneﬁ  ts of the frontline outweigh the risks, but the ones who do will have earned the troops’ respect, and nothing will kill this whole debate faster than respect.
Even down the road, I’m going to check the 
comments section and still see the period guy ﬂ  aunting his thing. He’ll be telling us all we have to do to win a war is unleash a herd of women on their time of the month, so they can nag the enemy to death. Then I will reach through the Internet to high-ﬁ  ve this dude because across time and space, he will still be sitting behind his keyboard making the same tired jokes, not noticing as the world pro-gresses around him.

opinions@alligator.orgIt is not uncommon for the more liberal elements of Ameri-
can politics to praise the welfare states found by the North Sea or north of our border.
It is indeed admirable how effectively such countries 
ensure the quality of life of their citizens.
But it is misleading and unhelpful to think of these 
countries as offering an alternative social and economic 
model to that of the United States. 
It is far better to view Scandinavian countries and 
Canada as comparable countries with successful practices that we can and ought to emulate.
For proof that we are not so different, look at the Heritage 
Foundation’s 2013 Index of Economic Freedom.
Canada is sixth in this ranking, Denmark ninth, the U.S. 
10th, Finland 16th and Sweden 18th. 
All of these countries surpassed the U.S. in business 
freedom as well, partly due to lower corporate tax rates.
Sweden’s government commands 51.3 percent of the 
gross domestic product compared to America’s 42 percent and Canada’s 42.9 percent.
The U.S. spends an additional 5.3 percent of GDP on tax 
expenditures. 
At any rate, America, Sweden and Canada can each be 
accurately categorized as having mixed market economies and big governments.
In light of Sweden’s and Canada’s substantial welfare 
states, it is impressive that they have kept balanced budgets and debt-to-GDP ratios below 50 percent.
Though much of this can be credited to a steady stream 
of tax revenue, it is also due to foresighted pension reforms. Unlike Social Security, which uses a demographically unsustainable “pay-as-you-go” system, Canada’s state pension plan is partially funded, while Sweden’s state pensions are partially privatized.
Yet, we would do well to recall the early 1990s, when 
Canada had a chronic deﬁ  cit of 6 percent GDP in 1994 with unemployment at 10 percent, and when Sweden’s deﬁ  cit was a whopping 13 percent of GDP with unemployment at 10 percent in 1993.
By comparison, America’s current unemployment rate 
stands at 7.8 percent, and the deﬁ  cit is 8 percent of GDP .
Despite elevated unemployment rates, Sweden and 
Canada massively reduced their deﬁ  cits during the 1990s, primarily through spending cuts. 
In Canada, $7 of spending was slashed for every dollar 
in tax increases. 
Cherished social programs were gutted, and tens of 
thousands of public employees were let go. 
But by 1998, neither country had a deﬁ  cit, while 
unemployment had fallen as well.
In contrast, over the last ﬁ  ve years, the U.S. increased spending and reduced taxes in the face of high unemployment and a high deﬁ  cit.
Compared to Canada’s and 
Sweden’s successes in the 1990s, current results in the U.S. have not 
been nearly as good. 
While Canada and Sweden also reduced taxes during 
the most recent recession, they did so from positions of relative ﬁ  scal strength, thus aiding the economic recovery without deepening their ﬁ  scal holes.
Admittedly, these countries began their cuts during the 
1990s with spending and tax levels higher than those in the U.S. 
Thus, tax cuts will be less effective in the U.S. today than 
they were in Canada and Sweden and, spending cuts will hurt more. 
However, despite the fact that government spending is 
no longer a larger share of GDP in Canada than in the U.S., Canada continues to forge ahead with such spending cuts.
Beyond ﬁ  scal policy, the North still has much to teach 
us. 
School choice programs introduced in the 1990s in 
Sweden have offered parents with limited means the ability to send their children to private schools.
Contrary to American fears that such programs will 
undermine public schools, Sweden’s state institutions improved following the end of the soon-to-be monopoly on education, evidenced by the fact that most Swedish pupils still attend public school.
Finnish schools — while all public — have a great deal 
of autonomy in curriculum development and pedagogy. 
Both Finnish and Canadian schools rely heavily on profes-
sional teacher development programs.
All of these countries’ schools best American ones 
on international assessments, despite lower per pupil expenditures.
I have not addressed the numerous social programs 
provided by Scandinavian countries that the U.S. does not offer to its citizens — these, no doubt, account for part of the high living standards enjoyed by Swedes, Finns and others.
Unfortunately, developing such programs is not an 
option for America, where governments at all levels face gaping budget holes.
We can, however, set a path for sustainable budgets and 
growth in the future.
Following the Northern model may be the way to go.                    William Alston is a columnist for The Dartmouth at

A Jewish center currently under 
construction in northwest Gainesville 
is set to reopen this fall.
The Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish 
Student and Community Center, located at 2021 NW Fifth Ave., has been in the process of reconstruction since April.
Rabbi Berl Goldman, executive di-
rector of the community center, said the original building couldn’t hold a lot of people. The center added a tent in the back of the building for a few years to accommodate residents and students, but that still couldn’t fix the space issue.
Goldman said the center decided 
to knock down the building to con-struct a larger center.
“We are just building a center to 
accommodate the ever-growing de-mand on our program’s services, to accommodate the current interest and participation and to accommo-date the future growth in generations that will attend,” he said.
Goldman said the center’s con-
struction costs about $4.5 million. He added that an endowment to the cen-ter will be $1.5 million.
The center is still raising money 
for the endowment. 
It has been funding the project 
through the help of donations from individuals and foundations, he said.
The new 23,000-square-foot center 
will have a 1,500-square-foot grand lobby, atrium, synagogue and social hall.
The center will also include a full-
time kosher cafe, exercise facility, children’s room, Judaic study library center and offices for student interns and the faculty of the center.
The building is being constructed 
to Leadership and Energy Environ-mental Design standards set by the U.S. Green Building Council, which is the first of its kind in North Central Florida, Goldman said.
Gabrielle Lipman, a 20-year-old 
UF health science junior, goes to Cha-bad and said she was excited for the changes.
“Throughout the time they’ve 
been building, they’ve had adequate space,” Lipman said. “I think it is ab-solutely great to have the infrastruc-ture to support Jewish students at UF.”New Jewish center under construction, set to reopen in FallELENI KOUVATSOS

Two UF professors have found 
a way to efficiently grow rice and other crops in communities suffer -
ing from a drought.
Rao Mylavarapu and Yuncong 
Li, professors in UF’s soil and water science department of the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, introduced a concept called aerobic rice production with the help of a Ph. D. candidate, a professor from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and a colleague from India.
The professors conducted the 
two-year study at the UF-Inter -
national Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics Interna-tional Distance Education Center in India. 
For hundreds of years, rice was grown in two phases. First, the seeds are planted under water in a nursery. Then, after they sprout, the rice is transplanted to the main field under more standing water.
Aerobic rice production, which 
skips the nursery phase, requires 37 to 45 percent less water than the traditional flooded paddy field sys-tem of production, according to the study.
In India, the government guar -antees farmers a certain profit per kilogram for growing rice. This in-centive encourages farmers to grow rice instead of other crops that use less water, Li said.
The new method aims to ad-
dress the lack of rainwater and groundwater in the region.
Researchers are still studying 
the aerobic process, trying to in-crease yield and find a way to sup-press weeds without using excess water.
“The philosophy in the U.S. is 
the same,” Li said. “We try to use less water and grow better crops.“
In the future, this research and 
similar studies may be useful in the production of other crops in India, the U.S. and around the globe.
“Water has become the most 
important natural resource in the world,” he said. “That’s the idea of our project — long-term sustain-ability of resources.”

Alachua County judges denied the 
appeals of 29 Occupy Gainesville protesters 
— including Bo Diddley’s son, Ellas Anthony McDaniel — to drop trespassing charges from 2011 during a case hearing Friday.
The defendants were arrested in violation 
of a city of Gainesville park hours ordinance, which states city park facilities are open for public use between 6 a.m. and 11:30 p.m.
During an Oct. 30 hearing, the defense 
argued the ordinance was “unconstitutionally overbroad” and “unconstitutionally vague,” according to Alligator archives.
Attorney Geoffrey Mason, who 
represents 27 of the defendants, said Tuesday he and the other defendants’ attorneys filed motions in April 2012 to dismiss the case on First Amendment violations.
The judges ruled Friday the ordinance 
didn’t violate the protesters’ constitutional rights because the ordinance is content-neutral, meaning it doesn’t distinguish between favored and disfavored speech based on the expressed views. The judges’ order said the protesters were arrested only because of their location in the center of the park. It stressed the park’s status as a free-speech zone during operating hours.
Mason said the defense plans to file 
supplemental motions next week based on a permit the protesters had applied for to use the park beyond regular hours from October 2011 to December 2012.
The city granted the permit but only 
allowed the group to use the park for one night with no further explanation, he said.
He said the ordinance, as written, allows 
the city manager complete control over whose requests are approved, making it a content-based ordinance.
“We’re saying that the ordinance allows 
[the city manager] to make this rule anything he wants it to be,” Mason said. 
If the new motions are dismissed, Mason 
said the defendants will likely go to trial.Gainesville protest case
occupies judges’ minds� THE STUDY FOUND THAT 
LIBRARIES ARE VALUED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.
BETHANY SCHUSTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Pew Research Center released new 
findings that showed about 70 percent of 
Americans browse or borrow print books from the library.
However, about 50 percent also said they 
visit the library to sit, read, study and watch or listen to media.
Patrick Reakes, chair of Library West, 
said although UF libraries circulate a lot of books and e-books, the study rooms and computers are the primary attractions to students.
“Anecdotally , it’s kind of a destination 
thing,” Reakes said. “There are social rea-sons to come here.”
UF biochemistry junior Evan Broggi, 23, 
said the library is a sanctuary away from distractions and an excellent place to study.
“People come for the atmosphere, not 
the resources,” he said.  
The study found that libraries were val-
ued in their communities, but people didn’t know all the services they had to offer. Americans in the study said what would entice them to use library services more.
About 35 percent of those surveyed 
highly requested library services, such as Ask a Librarian, applications for collections, GPS library maps and technology petting zoos, which are stations where technology is brought in to sample.
However, at the George A. Smathers Li-
braries, many of those ideas are already in 
practice.
“It’s really interest-
ing because so many things on the list we’re already doing,” said
Diane Bruxvoort, a 
senior associate dean of the Smathers Libraries. 
Reakes said the Ask a Librarian tool is 
already available, and RSS feeds from the catalog collection app are open to the pub-lic. He said a Google building search for in-side UF libraries is in the works.
UF libraries also offer workshops on 
how to utilize technology , and Bruxvoort said iPads will be available for students to check out within a few weeks.
“Our goal is to support the teaching and 
learning of the students and the researching of the faculty on this campus, ” she said.Libraries used as social hubsA two-year study was conducted in India“We try to use less water

� THE OFFICE IS PAPERLESS.

An orthodontist’s office is usually the last 
place someone would expect to find touch-
screen computers, fingerprint scanners and 3-D video presentations.
However, with a digital age zooming into 
perspective, Dr. Nicole Mullally and her staff at Studio 32 Orthodontics are meeting it head-on.
The office, at 2222 NW 40th Terrace, Suite 
B, combines digital technology with energy efficiency to create a modern experience for patients, Mullally said.
Mullally said her staff uses digital X-rays 
and 3-D videos to show patients what will be done to their teeth as well as how to take care of their braces.
Michele Exelbirt, Studio 32 office manager, 
said although her office strives to meet pa-tients’ needs on a personal level, she stressed the importance of technology.
“I think moving ahead and going into ‘The 
Jetsons’ way of life is important,” she said.
With technology on hand, Mullally said the 
office is also energy efficient. It was built using recycleable materials to limit its carbon foot-print. She said her office is paperless and has patients sign in for appointments by scanning their fingerprints onto touch-screen comput-ers.
Exelbirt added the office was purposely 
built near a bus stop so patients wouldn’t have to drive their cars for an appointment.
“The office is doing its very miniscule, at-
om-sized part in this universe to prevent any more pollution from happening,” she said.
A kids’ section and a Wii gaming console 
keep children at ease and entertained, said Stephanie Goll, mother of patient Erin Goll.
“The kids’ section is better. I always look 
for that,” she said. “If we didn’t go to a dentist 
with computers and things to keep Erin en-tertained, he’d definitely get bored — at least here he can play the Wii.”WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 30, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

The Student Government Election Commission dismissed 
its first election code complaint Tuesday. The commission 
ruled 4-to-1 to dismiss the complaints filed against the Swamp Party and its presidential candidate Christina Bonarrigo for campaigning.
Campaigning is restricted to one week before the first day of 
elections and includes election-specific material, according to election codes. The elections are Feb. 19 and Feb. 20.
Students Party counsel Christian Chessman filed a com-plaint citing five violations Tuesday night after Bonarrigo announced her candidacy for Student Body president on Turlington Plaza on Thursday. In the submitted com-plaint, the Students Party cited one of the wrong codes.
“The relevant portion of these statutes 
is clear,” Chessman said. “If you support a specific candidate, you are in violation.”
Swamp Party counsel Ryan Gilbert de-
fended his party by stating that the Swamp Party’s announce-ment could be considered campaign activity, which is allowed four weeks before elections. Campaign activity includes action in support of a candidate that is not election-specific.
Gilbert said the Swamp Party never intended to violate elec-
tion codes.
“The point is to not bombard people on campus for a long 
amount of time,” he said.
The commission ruled that Bonarrigo’s announcement was 
campaign material, which was allowed at that time.
Chessman will appeal the Election Commission decision to 
the UF Supreme Court for a hearing. Chessman said the meet-ing is tentatively scheduled for Feb. 6.

Josh Tobias and Vickash Ramjit 
know they’ll see the field for Florida 
this season. They know they’ll be starting, too. 
But they don’t know where on the 
diamond they’ll be lined up, and that’s fine with them.
Following the 2012 season, the 
Gators lost right fielder Preston Tucker and left fielder Daniel Pigott to gradu-ation. Senior outfielder Tyler Thomp-son left the team earlier this month for personal reasons. Sophomore Justin Shafer is the only established outfield-er remaining on the roster.
To fill out the lineup, Tobias, a soph-
omore who started 44 of 51 games at third base as a freshman, could play in the outfield along with Ramjit, a red-shirt senior who started 21 games at first base and 12 in left field in 2012.
“Wherever they need me,” Ramjit 
said. “I don’t have a preference. As long as our team is stable. If I’m in right, I’m in right. I’m fine with that.”
Where Ramjit plays will primarily 
depend on the development of young-er players at first base and in the out-field. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan men-tioned freshmen Kevin Stypulkowski and Brady Roberson and redshirt sophomore Zack Powers as possible alternatives at first. 
Conversely, Ramjit would play 
primarily first base if freshmen out-fielders Christian Dicks and Harrison Bader earn playing time. 
Tobias has taken most of his prac-
tice reps at third base but has also practiced in the outfield in case the depth after Shafer remains an issue during the season.
“I’m comfortable anywhere,” Tobi-
as said. “I’ve practiced outfield, third base, second base. So whichever they put me at, I’m comfortable there.”
If Tobias is forced to play the out-
field, O’Sullivan has Cody Dent and Zack Powers available to play third base. Dent, the team’s only senior be-sides Ramjit, started 21 games at third in both 2011 and 2012 and filled in last year when Tobias missed more than a month with a hand injury.
Powers also started 21 games at 
third base in 2011 and was named to the Southeastern Conference All-

When the Gators play unselfishly on offense, 
good things happen.
No. 4 Florida has been successful distribut-
ing the ball during six games of Southeastern 
Conference play, averaging an SEC-high 16.8 assists. 
Strong ball movement has led to improved 
shot selection in recent games. Against confer -
ence opponents, UF has shot 51.2 percent from the field, drilled 41 percent of its attempts from behind the arc and scored 74.7 points per con-test. All three of those averages are SEC bests.
“Our guys are recognizing what’s open,” 
coach Billy Donovan said. “When you go back to before the holidays, we had a lot of games where we had 10, 11, 12 or 13 assists, and you’d like to be up to 17 or 22. That’s an ideal number. But the guy with the ball in his hands has to make good reads and good decisions and find 
the open man. 
“When we do that, 
we become difficult to guard, because we 
have a lot of different pieces with the floor be-ing spaced that finds an open shooter or it finds inside to (junior center) Patric (Young) or finds different spots on the floor. Guys are getting more open and better looks.”
Florida recorded a season-high 23 assists, 
including nine from junior point guard Scottie Wilbekin, against Mississippi State on Satur -
day. Four players scored in double-digits dur -
ing UF’s blowout win. 
In SEC play, no Gator has taken more than 
17.7 percent of UF’s 334 field goal attempts.
Florida’s balanced approach on offense 
begins with Wilbekin, who was named SEC Player of the Week on Monday. This season, he has notched 5.1 assists per game — the highest average by a Gator since point guard Nick Cal-athes tallied 6.4 per contest in 2008-09. 
Stepping in for Erving Walker as UF’s start-
ing point guard this year, Wilbekin has done a better job of studying his options. Although Walker ended his college career as UF’s all-time assists leader, he was a shoot-first guard.   
Young has noticed a difference with Wil-
bekin steering the offense.   
“This is the first time I’ve ever been on a 
team where the point guard actually looks for the lob,” Young said. “Most of the time, I’m looking for the guard to shoot the ball, so it’s kind of weird.”
Although ball security was an issue for Flor -
ida against Mississippi State on Saturday, the Gators have the second-lowest turnover total in Ball movement

Jennifer George first suffered a right shoulder dislocation 
against LSU on Jan. 6, and the effects of the injury are lingering 
as Florida muddles through Southeastern Conference play . 
The Gators’ current four-game losing streak — its first such 
slide since dropping four straight contests in February 2011 — has UF tied with four other teams for eighth in the conference. 
With its top performer limited for much of January , Florida 
has looked the part of the nation’s fifth-least experienced team.  
“Jennifer’s injury has gotten us out of sync,” coach Amanda 
Butler said. “There’s not any reason to act like it’s not having an impact. Certainly it’s having an impact.”
George overcame the initial injury without missing a game. 
However, she suffered a second dislocation in the first half against Tennessee on Jan. 13. Since then, UF has struggled. The Gators fell to the Volun-
teers 78-75 in overtime before dropping their next two games at home to then-No. 19 South Carolina and Ole Miss, a team that 
was winless in five SEC games before defeat-ing Florida 88-81.
George sat out against the Gamecocks be-
fore returning to face the Rebels. But she was not her usual self in the loss, scoring only six points on 2-of-5 shooting in 23 minutes. 
Against No. 14 Georgia, Florida’s lone 
senior continued to battle her physical limi-tations. She was one of four Gators who notched eight points. But without a fully pro-
ductive anchor in the middle, UF was overmatched by UGA. 
“It was kind of a worst-case scenario,” Butler said of her 
team’s loss to Georgia. “You’re playing one of the best teams UF struggling with senior limited by injury

The Florida women’s tennis team 
dominated its season opener, defeat-
ing USF 7-0 on Tuesday at Linder Stadium.
Danielle Collins and Brianna Mor -
gan played their first collegiate dual matches. Both players won their sin-gles matches. 
“Our freshmen did a good job,” 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “Maybe they didn’t play as well in the first set as I’ve seen in practice, but you can’t really expect that of them. The fact that they handled that and worked their way through it is even more impressive than if they just would have gone out there with no pressure.”
Collins struggled in the first set of 
her singles match, allowing the Bulls’ Fanny Fracassi to win 5 games. But Collins broke through and caught Racassi at her weak spots.
“(During) the first set, I was kind 
of thrown off by my opponent’s game a little bit because she was a little bit unorthodox,” Collins said. “She had some different shots. She used a lot of slice and different top spin balls and angles, so I was a little thrown off by that in the beginning. Definitely in a first match you don’t come across a lot of players like that.”
Collins found her rhythm in the 
second set, shutting out Fracassi 6-0. 
“When it got to 5-all in the first set 
and once I won the game 5-all and then at 6-5, I think that gave me a lot of confidence,” Collins said.
“I knew that no matter how tight 
the match would get, I would be able to pull it out. I just told myself to be disciplined and try to focus on one point at a time, and not let her get into the set again like I did in the first.”
Junior Sofie Oyen dominated 
USF’s Danielle Mills, winning 6-1 in the first set and 6-2 in the second. Oyen is the nation’s top-ranked sin-gles player, and she showed why on Tuesday.
“I’m improving, getting stronger, 
and I’m just really proud of myself,” Oyen said.Senior Lauren Embree came out 
strong in both doubles and singles, earning her 99th career doubles win with an 8-4 score. Embree also earned her 98th career singles victory with a 6-1, 6-1 victory against the Bulls’ Lo-reto Alonso-Martinez.
Embree teamed up with Oyen in 
doubles, and the two earned Flori-da’s first point against USF.
“Lauren and Sofie were excel-
lent,” Thornqvist said. “They made pace. They not only matched it but topped it at times, and we were the more creative team.”
Florida’s Olivia Janowicz and 
Caroline Hitimana also won their singles matches.
UF hosts UCF today at 3 p.m., and 
Thornqvist is looking to feature the freshmen in match play.
“I like that [Collins and Morgan] 
can buckle down when they have to because that is what’s coming in the next matches,” Thornqvist said. “You’re going to have to face that beast at some point. And if we have the chance to do that, then that’s how we’ll win the real matches.”

Thanks to a strong second 
round, the Florida women’s golf 
team took home its third vic-tory of the season on Sunday in Lecanto.  
UF won the Florida Challenge 
against Florida State, Miami, UCF and USF.
Five of eight Gators posted 
better scores in the second round than they did in the first. Camilla Hedberg, the tournament’s even-tual co-champion, improved from a 72 to a 71.
The women were led by senior 
Isabelle Lendl and sophomore Camilla Hedberg, who boast the second- and third-best stroke av-erage in the nation, respectively.
Lendl averages a 70.67, and 
Hedberg averages a 70.75.
Lendl opened with an unchar -
acteristic round, shooting almost four strokes above her average. But she managed to pull her score down by three strokes in the sec-ond round.
Hedberg, with her victory, 
joined just 11 other players in UF history to win at least three tour -
naments.
Senior Mia Piccio finished in 
the top 10. After scoring a 75 in the first round, she lowered her score to a 73 in the second round and finished tied for eighth with Mary Beth Ramsay from Florida State. 
Piccio shot 1.9 strokes above 
her average of 72.1 but was closer to her usual form in the second round. 
“We’re taking it one tourna-
ment at a time,” Piccio said in 
November.
“I think it’s 
very important to stay the pro-cess rather than looking ahead. We just got to keep working hard at prac-
tice, working hard when we’re playing, fighting though our rounds when we’re not playing that great, because that’s how we get better. Just keep on playing. I think that’s it when playing golf: The more you play, the more you improve and get better on the course.”  
Emma Smyser was one of the 
Gators who improved between rounds, and her jump was the largest.
Playing in her first collegiate 
tournament, she shot a 75 in the second round — seven strokes better than her first-round score of 82.    
Smyser’s role on in Florida’s 
lineup will grow as the season progresses and expand even more when three seniors leave at the end of this season. 
Junior Elcin Ulu was one of three Gators who performed worse in the second round than the first.
Florida may have been in 
line for an even greater victory had Ulu, who transferred from Redlands Community College in Oklahoma, not followed up a tournament-low 69 in the first round with a 77 in the second.  
The Gators have two more 
tournaments on the road, at the Northrup Grumman Regional Championship in Palos Verdes, Calif., and the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, before they return home to Gainesville to host and compete in the SunTrust Gator Invitational on March 15-17.

WOMEN’S GOLFSEC play. 
Wilbekin’s 2.6 assist-to-turnover ratio 
ranks second in the conference. Senior guard 
Kenny Boynton, who is second on the team with 2.8 assists per game, leads the SEC with a 4.5 assist-to-turnover ratio during confer -
ence play. 
“Those guys have done a good job back 
there taking care of the basketball,” Dono-van said. “We had a little lapse midway through the second half (against Mississippi State) where we had some careless turnovers from Scottie and Kenny and Mike Rosario, but Scottie has done a really, really good job of finding people when they have been open. He has made really good decisions, and I think he has made the game easier for other people around him.”
No. 4 Florida (16-2, 2-0 SEC) will look 
to maintain its discipline on offense when it hosts South Carolina tonight at 8 in the 
O’Connell Center. 
The Gamecocks (12-7, 
2-4 SEC) are 12th in the SEC in scoring defense, allowing 67.6 points per game. South Carolina ranks No. 13 in the 
conference in both steals per game (4.9) and turn-over margin (minus-2.3).
“We see on film, when we don’t take good 
shots, teams get out on us on fastbreaks and score,” Boynton said. “Good shots is basi-cally the main thing.”
Freshman team, hitting .250 with seven RBIs. He missed all of the 2012 sea-
son recovering from shoulder surgery.
O’Sullivan was not caught off guard by losing three outfielders. He has 
made a point of recruiting players who are versatile defensively.
“You only have 27 scholarship players, and with the emphasis that we 
placed on the pitching side of things, you have position players that are 
multiple defenders,” O’Sullivan said.
With the season set to begin on Feb. 15, O’Sullivan 
still has time to finalize his defense. No matter what he decides, Powers is confident it will work.
“All of our outfielders are extremely athletic, so it’s not going to be that 
big of a deal,” Powers said of the inexperience in the outfield. “They have great coaching, athleticism, and the fact that they are here shows a lot.”

Forward leads UF in scoring, rebounding despite missed time
in our league after they have had a bye week 
and coming off an embarrassing loss.” 
George is currently dealing with her own 
worst-case scenario.
With no remaining eligibility after this 
season, she has had no choice but to battle through the pain.
She leads Florida with 12.7 points and 8.1 
rebounds per game but has averaged just 7.3 points and 3.3 rebounds per game during the Gators’ losing streak. 
“My senior year — you don’t want to miss 
any time,” George said. “It’s frustrating not being at full speed and full strength and help-ing the team out as much as I know I can.” 
A lingering issue — other than the discom-
fort of wearing a brace to support her shoul-der — is the internal conflict George deals with each time she steps on the floor. 
After dealing with the recurring shoulder 
injury for the past month, she continues to worry about another setback.
“It runs through my mind,” George said. “I’m not as aggressive as I used to be. I’m try-ing to work on that as much as possible.”
Sophomore Kayla Lewis has had her 
own frustrations stemming from injury . She missed 49 games during her first two seasons with Florida due to multiple lower-body in-juries.
Lewis expects a fully healthy George to 
help guide the Gators out of their current struggles but understands the progression of returning from an injury.
“It’s a part of the process of being injured,” 
Lewis said. “I’m a testament to that. It takes a little bit of time to get back in sync. [George] is showing how much she wants to play just being out there.”
