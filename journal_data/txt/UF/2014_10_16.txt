It took less than three minutes for 
the Board of Trustees to unanimous-
ly determine UF’s 12th president, Kent Fuchs (pronounced “fox”), on Wednesday.
After ﬁ  ve months of searching 
and a $95,000 search committee fee, the provost of Cornell University will succeed President Bernie Ma-chen’s seat on Jan.1.  
“When I ﬁ  rst met Dr. Fuchs, he 
clearly was outstanding,” said Presi-dential Search Committee Chair-man Steven Scott.  “His integrity, his 
judgment – and the more I looked 
at other folks and considered other people, he clearly stood out. He’s a true academic leader.”
Fuchs, 59, has 20 years of leader-
ship at land-grant universities like 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, Purdue University and Cornell. He said his immediate goal for the Spring is to learn about UF from the students, faculty and alum-ni.
“I have less than roughly two 
months to make the transition,” he said. “I’m going to use the ﬁ  rst 100 
days in developing relationships — 
the ﬁ  rst 100 days in listening and un-derstanding aspirations individuals have.”
Fuchs said he plans to set up spe-
ciﬁ  c three-year goals on building and implementing UF’s preeminence in the summer and fall of 2015.
“I have endorsed those,” he said. 
“I am enthusiastic about those, and I think it’s really exciting.”
Within his 12 years as the Joseph 
Silbert Dean of Engineering and as provost at Cornell, Fuchs developed a plan for preeminence to make Cor-nell one of the world’s top 10 uni-
versities. Among his initiatives to 
enhance Cornell’s academic stand-ing, he led the effort in building a graduate school of applied sciences in New York City.
“Perhaps Kent’s greatest legacy 
as provost will be the Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island,” Cor-nell University President David Skorton said in a statement. “More than any other individual, Kent’s foresight and determination result-ed in our successful bid to establish Cornell Tech.”
Scott said the Board of Trustees 
felt like it needed a new leader to make UF a top 10 public university. UF is currently ranked No. 14 by the U.S. News & World Report.
“And he’s that person,” Scott 
said. “Now we’re on our way.”
Scott said Fuchs sees his transi-
tion to UF as coming back home.
Originally from Miami, Fuchs 
graduated from Miami Killian Se-

A man armed with a riﬂ  e held a woman 
hostage before turning the gun on himself 
Tuesday night.
Alachua County deputies received 
a phone call at about 8:30 p.m. from a woman saying 49-year-old Timothy Loren Brower had a riﬂ  e and was threatening to kill himself. 
Before police had the chance to arrive at 
14114 NW 173rd St. in Alachua, the wom-an said she left the residence, got inside of a white GMC van and locked the doors for safety, according to a release. 
But after the woman locked herself in the van, Brower smashed a window to get inside — still armed with a riﬂ  e — and 
drove away from the residence, Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokeswoman Becky Butscher wrote in an email.
When police caught up to the vehicle 
traveling south on Interstate 75, they were 
able to conﬁ  rm that the woman who called deputies was inside of the van with Brow-
er. 
Police believed the woman was being 
held hostage and began to pursue the car.
Brower drove to a home at 211 SE Waca-
hoota Road in Micanopy. 
When he stopped, he exited the car with 
the riﬂ  e, a release said. 
Police witnessed him dragging the Man fatally shoots himself in City of Alachua hostage situation

It’s great to be a Florida Gator – 
and to live in Gainesville.
Gainesville ranked No. 5 in the 
top 20 best small cities for college 
students, according to the ranking released Monday by The American Institute for Economic Research. Factors like student life, culture, economic health and opportunity were assessed from various small 
college cities nationwide.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said one of the most important fac-
tors was how closely bound the university and community are.
“It’s hard for anybody to think 
of Gainesville without thinking about the University of Florida,” 
he said.
Orlando said the music scene 
and locally owned restaurants 
make for a vibrant and interesting city culture.
“Everything really centers 
around and caters to students,” he said.
Orlando said county public 
schools will be closed Friday along with UF for the Homecoming Pa-rade, which shows how invested the Gainesville and Alachua com-
munities are in UF.
Tallahassee ranked No. 19 on 
the list of 20 cities. Orlando said 
this could be because Florida’s capital has other major identifying 
factors, like state government.
Nicholas Smith, general man-
ager of The Swamp Restaurant, 
said his business has been around for about 20 years.
“Gainesville has everything 
you need while still being a small town,” he said, “and we’re happy to be a part of it.”
Smith, who attended UF in 
1997, said he moved away after 
college but couldn’t resist coming 
back. He said Gainesville is differ-ent from other small cities because it doesn’t feel clustered.
“You have a mix of outdoor 
things to do like Paynes Prairie and Lake Wauburg, a great univer-
sity, great arts scene and, of course, 
great sports,” he said.
Simon Nash, a barista at 
Maude’s Café, said Gainesville is 
like a big city but with half the cost 
of living.
“It has lots of affordable, inter-
esting restaurants, beautiful wom-
en, a great school and a great art scene,” he said.
Nash said Gainesville is differ-
ent because it’s so diverse, includ-ing downtown. He said his favor-
ite part of Gainesville is its high 
concentration of intelligent, pro-
gressive-minded young people.
“University of Florida people 
tend to be more my cup of tea,” he 
said.
Kelly Vidal, a 21-year-old UF 
political science senior, said she 
thinks Gainesville was ranked high because of the amount of students 
in the population. She said she also 
likes that everything she needs is 
by campus, unlike in Tallahassee.
“It makes sense that the best 
school in Florida is ranked so high-
ly,” Vidal said.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

ward the house, ignoring their com-mands to stop.
Making his way over to the residence, 
a deputy fired shots at Brower in an ef-fort to protect the woman as well as po-tential residents inside the home and the 
deputies at the scene.
Brower then turned the gun on him-
self. 
He was pronounced dead on scene. 
A pending autopsy report will de-
termine the official cause of Brower’s death.
The deputy involved has not been 
identified and is on administrative leave 
until the investigations are complete, 
per standard procedure.Including the Brower incident, there 
have been 11 officer-involved shoot-ings by the sheriff’s office in the last five 
years, Butscher said, the last one being 
July 21 in Gilchrist County. 
In 2013, there were a total of 31 sui-
cides in Alachua County – more than double the amount of homicides that 
year, according to the Florida Suicide 
Prevention Coalition. 
Gilchrist County, where Don Spirit 
killed his daughter, six grandchildren 
and then himself on Sept. 18, had a to-
tal of two suicides and one homicide in 2013.
Brower had two traffic violations in 
2009 – for operating a mobile vehicle 
with an expired registration and driving 
with a suspended license.

UF spokeswoman Janine 
Sikes said the salary range of 
the new president was deter-mined by an outside consul-tant and will range between $900,000 and $1.2 million.
“We have worked very, very 
hard — not near as hard as Dr. 
Scott — but certainly it’s good 
to have the process behind us and be able to look forward to what happens in January,” Sikes said.
Florida Congressman Ted 
Yoho gave a statement welcom-ing Fuchs and his wife to The Gator Nation.
“Dr. Fuchs proven leader-
ship will help ensure that the proud heritage and reputa-tion that has been earned at UF/IFAS — as one of the top leaders in the nation in higher academics and innovation — will not only remain intact but flourish,” Yoho said.
Fuchs said interacting with 
students is a high priority be-cause it is important for a presi-dent not to be aloof.“I would love to get both 
face time as well as electronic interaction with the students and get to become a member of that community.” Fuchs said. “With 50,000 students and just this wealth of graduates, it’s important the president be vis-ible and accessible.”
Student Body President 
Cory Yeffet said he saw Fuchs as the best candidate.
“He’s compassionate and 
cares about the students and really wants to get to know the student body and understand how he can work with students to accomplish the goal of be-
coming a top 10 public institu-
tion,” Yeffet said.
Fuchs said he is enthusiastic 
and optimistic about the future of UF.
“It is an amazing place, and 
I’m so pleased we have this op-portunity to be a part of this community,” Fuchs said. “It’s

UF’s Institute of Food and Agri-
cultural Sciences has partnered with 
two global agricultural companies to help sustain the world’s growing population by 2050.
Limagrain, an international 
agricultural group, will provide $200,000 to IFAS over a three-year period, while its daughter company HM. CLAUSE will provide $100,000 over a five-year period to the Chal-lenge 2050 project.
Through the Challenge 2050 
project, students take four courses 
on topics such as global food-system 
problems to earn a Global Leader-ship and Change certificate.
The IFAS and College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences certification pro-gram helps students create solutions to global problems.
Teresa Balser, the dean of IFAS, said HM. CLAUSE believed in the project when the idea was first brought to them.
“They got really excited about it, 
and they were the ones who initially invested money in it,” she said.
The project, which started in 
2013, will bring executives from agriculture companies on campus 
to mentor students in the certificate 
program. Students may also get offered internships from the com-panies, according to an IFAS news release.
“What’s neat about this is it’s 
all students from different majors,” Balser said. “We need everybody’s perspective, we need everybody’s 
ideas and we need everybody work-
ing together on this.”
About 30 students are participat-
ing in each of the Fall courses for the project.
Balser said the students form 
bonds when trying to solve these is-sues.
“It’s the only class I’ve ever been 
in where on the last day of class they all asked for a class photo,” she said.
Christine Adams, a biology se-
nior, said the project is important for the future of the planet.
“I think it is something we need 
to focus on in the future to be able to feed everyone and have a sus-tainable world by 2050,” Adams, 22, said. “Our population keeps on growing, so it is important to have the resources to sustain the popula-tion.”
Balser said the project has turned 
into something that will really make 
change in the world.
“For me, there’s a validation in 
knowing that I could bring a crazy 
idea to this campus, and people would get behind it and they would want to make it happen,” she said.

A Citra man accused of attempting to cash fraudu-
lent checks evaded capture for two hours Wednesday 
as he led a force of police officers, helicopters and K-9 units on a manhunt through dense forests and swampy grounds. 
A police dog, Argos, caught Deontae Demetris Kelly, 
23, who went underwater to elude officers near Fred Bear Drive and Williston Road, according to a report.
The chase began at about 11:15 a.m. when Gainesville 
Police received a call from Gator’s Dockside about suspi-cious checks.
Kelly had attempted to cash checks from Gator’s 
Dockside at Publix on Southwest Archer Road. Publix alerted the sports bar and both confirmed to police that 
the checks were fraudulent.
GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said Kelly did 
not work at Gator’s Dockside, and it is believed that he 
was manufacturing the checks.Police said Kelly also attempted to 
cash other checks at a different Publix location Tuesday using his own ID.
But when police attempted to ap-
prehend Kelly at Publix, he fled across Archer Road and into the woods be-
hind WingHouse of Gainesville. GPD 
and helicopter units searched the area 
for Kelly. The Alachua County Sher-iff’s Office also joined the search when 
witnesses spotted Kelly outside of GPD jurisdiction.
After two hours, officers on foot captured Kelly in a 
swampy area of the woods. 
“This incident is a perfect example of local law en-
forcement working as one team,” Tobias said. 
Kelly received treatment for a canine bite and other 
injuries. He will likely be charged with two counts of fraud, resisting arrest and potentially other probation-related charges. Tobias said Kelly also has a history in Marion County for fraud, battery on law enforcement and escape.IFAS to receive $300,000 to help

Alligator Contributing Writer
Residents participated in 
an evening of live demonstra-
tions, giveaways and tours at 
Gainesville Police headquarters Wednesday as a part of Celebrate 
Safe Communities.
The event was hosted by GPD 
in an effort to raise awareness for 
personal safety and crime reduc-
tion in the community.
“This is a chance for the com-
munity to come in and meet all 
the ofﬁ  cers, see all the different 
resources and see some of the ca-
nines,” said GPD spokesman Of-
ﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Celebrate Safe Communities is 
an example of GPD’s “communi-
ty-oriented policing model,” To-bias said, with local ofﬁ  cers often working with residents to build trust between the department 
and the community.
Residents were able to walk 
around at the event and gather 
information from various orga-nizations like Crime Prevention 
Security Systems, the Forensic 
Crime Unit and the Advanced 
Law Enforcement Riﬂ  e Team — 
all of which partner with GPD.
Every year, the department 
aims to bridge the gap between residents and ofﬁ  cers, Tobias 
said.
Ericka Jackson, police crime 
analyst for the City of Gainesville, 
said when citizens, communi-
ties and law enforcement come 
together, “it helps better address 
crime and make the city a safer 
place to live.”

Fuchs presidential 
selection
On Wednesday, the UF Board of Trustees selected Kent 
Fuchs to be the university’s next president. Fuchs cur-rently serves as the provost of Cornell University, one of 
the nation’s premier institutions of higher learning.
Fuchs’ academic credentials are impeccable, which makes 
him an ideal choice for the position.  According to information provided by the UF Board of Trustees, Fuchs is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Associa-tion for the Advancement of Scienc, and numerous other aca-demic and professional organizations.
As provost at Cornell, Fuchs oversaw a number of initiatives 
to help guide the university toward a top-10 ranking and to en-hance its academic reputation. Fuchs has also demonstrated his commitment to diversity in academia through his leadership in 
Cornell’s Toward New Destinations program. The board de-
serves credit for its decision making throughout the presidential selection process. 
Hunter Rawlings, president of the Association of American 
Universities, effusively praised UF’s choice of Fuchs, describing him as smart, highly organized, consultative yet also decisive; a person of high integrity and strong vision.
“He will be a superb leader for the University of Florida as 
well as a great colleague for his fellow AAU presidents and 
chancellors,” Rawlings said.
In addition to stellar qualiﬁ  cations, Fuchs seemed enthusias-
tic about potentially becoming the next president of The Gator 
Nation. “It would a real honor and privilege to be a member and a No. 1 fan of The Gator Nation,” he said. Fuchs’ response stark-ly contrasted his competitor, NYU Provost David McLaughlin’s, apathetic response of: “I will be, at best, an honorary Gator.”
UF’s decision to select candidates with exceptional academic 
qualiﬁ  cations is especially relevant in the wake of Florida State 
University’s selection of its own new president. FSU appar-
ently chose its new leader, state Sen. John Thrasher, based on his extensive political and business connections and not on his academic credentials. In addition to serving as a Florida senator, Thrasher previously served as the chair of Gov. Rick Scott’s re-election campaign.
Unlike the candidates selected by the board, Thrasher has 
no signiﬁ  cant academic experience whatsoever. His supporters claimed he was selected based on his strong fundraising ability. 
However, Fuchs also has signiﬁ  cant fundraising prowess, hav-
ing raised $1 billion in gifts during his career at Cornell.
The selection of Fuchs demonstrates to the entire country that 
UF is serious about establishing itself as one of the nation’s pre-mier universities. The decision also shows that universities do not have to sacriﬁ  ce a commitment to academics by hiring presi-dents who are little more than professional fundraisers.
UF students can be conﬁ  dent that their new president is ﬁ  rm-
ly committed to making their school a better, stronger univer-
sity. We look forward to a bold new era of growth and change at 
UF under Fuchs’ leadership.

you try the tofu at Chipotle?Today’s question: Are you pleased with the new 
president-elect?We can do more with modern technology
Last Wednesday, rockstar astrophysicist Neil de-
Grasse Tyson gave the keynote address at a con-ference for the information security industry. I 
refer to him as a rockstar because he’s the only astro-physicist I know by name. I’d imagine I’m not alone.
The address was fairly lengthy and casual. Tyson 
wore jeans and joked about letters he got from ticked-
off second graders after the revoking of Pluto’s plan-
etary status.
The most interesting portion of Tyson’s spiel was 
when he called out the tech industry’s startup culture, saying “society has bigger problems than what can be 
solved with your next app.” Tyson was criticizing what 
he believes is a decline in American innovation.
We have an incredible amount of resources and 
potential, but we’re using it to create goat simulators 
and new nude-picture-sharing technologies rather than 
things that actually beneﬁ  t society.
The fact is, we’re living in a period of incredible tech-
nological revolutions and innovations.
iPhones came out only seven years ago yet, for most 
of us, life without them is already wholly unimagina-ble.
This tremendous proliferation of information tech-
nology brings with it incredible potential, which we’ve 
mostly used so far to fulﬁ  ll our desire for constant grati-
ﬁ  cation and entertainment.
It makes sense that Tyson would give a speech la-
menting the fact that technology isn’t doing as much as it can to improve society before a group of people 
dedicated to promoting technologies that serve soci-
ety’s best interests.
Both Tyson and these technological innovators look 
at our advancements and see the capability to make 
even greater strides in health sciences, transportation 
and energy.
One thing Tyson didn’t elaborate on is the effect our developments could have on broader social issues, which information technology isn’t 
tackling at full capacity.
As any harping Journalism 
2.0 advocate will eagerly tell 
you, social media is the big-
gest thing since the Gutenberg 
Bible.
Sure, social media was widely used to organize 
events from Ferguson to the Arab Spring to the Hong Kong protests. However, in none of these cases has real, 
lasting, positive change happened. Protests in St. Lou-
is reignited last weekend, and the legacy of the Arab Spring so far has been a new crop of tyrants in Egypt and chaos in the Middle East so menacing that our mili-
tary is getting involved yet again.
Even when technology is used this way, the goals are 
often superﬁ  cial and anticlimactic. The truth campaign 
intends to use viral technology to mobilize our genera-tion to stamp out cigarette smoking forever. It’s a cool 
idea, but are there no other worthy causes? Smoking is 
horrible for you, but there isn’t a single person over the age of 5 in this country who doesn’t already know that. Surely we can set higher goals for ourselves.
With our vast resources and our ability to access 
and disseminate enormous amounts of information, we stand at an important point in history.
We are the ones who get to decide how these amaz-
ing technologies will be used. We get to help decide 
how today’s kids and every generation after will inter-
act with, understand and perceive their world. 
With that, I’m going to go watch Netﬂ  ix for the next 
dozen hours or so.

Contemporary Christian artist 
Jason Gray’s “With Every Act of 
Love Tour” will grace Gainesville tonight.
Gray is bringing his 
Centricity Music label-mates Unspoken, Lindsay McCaul and Carrollton to join in a soulful, infectious performance tonight at 7 p.m. at Abundant Grace Community Church, 12505 NW 39th Ave. Tickets can be purchased through iTickets.com 
for $15 today.
His latest album, “Love Will 
Have the Final Word,” debuted 
on Billboard’s Christian Albums at No. 10 and includes his ﬁ  rst No. 1 single, which the tour is named after, on Billboard’s Christian AC Indicator chart.
“I write from that place of 
wanting to tell my story authenti-cally where people hear and say, ‘Ah, me too,’” Gray said.  “I usu-ally write the songs that I want to hear and be true to my experience of grace, and do it in a way that’s authentic.”
He has a speech impediment, 
but it’s lost when he starts to sing.  “What I’m the most interested 
in being a part of is healing,” he said. “I care about music, it helps promote healing.”
Mike Gilland, associate pastor 
of Abundant Grace Community Church and assistant program di-
rector for 106.9 The Pulse, said Gray is a man with a “mission and a message.”
“The fact that he stut-
ters, he’s made that a part of his ministry, he uses it in his concerts, and he talks about serving a God who is 
able to overcome whatever people 
feel are their boundaries,” Gilland 
said.
The 61-year-old Gainesville 
resident said he is humbled by the privilege of having such top-notch artists perform at his church.
“If you listen to any Christian 
radio station at all, the music is go-ing to be very recognizable, very 
familiar,” Gilland said.
Gray promises it will be a night 
to remember for his audience.
“The experience of the night 
will be a lot of joy and a lot of 
laughter,” Gray said. “You’ll be crying one moment and laughing the next, and it’s something I’m grateful to be a part of.”

As the cool weather of autumn arrives, 
coffee drinkers are trading in their iced bev-
erages for hot brews. Local cafe menus are ﬁ  lling up with ﬂ  avors of the season, and while the pumpkin spice latte is a dead-set 
tradition, creative alternatives are emerging. 
Put down the PSL and explore these origi-
nal beverages local coffee shops created with 
fall in mind. 
Maple latte at CYM Coffeehouse5402 NW Eighth Ave.Real maple syrup, cinnamon and nutmeg 
create a dense, buttery ﬂ  avor that captures 
the essence of fall. One sip, and you’ll be 
taken to fall festivals, pumpkin patches and campﬁ  res. With a white picket fence and a decorative ﬁ  replace, the shop makes you feel at home — all you need is a wool blanket and your favorite book to complete the picture.
Mexican hot chocolate at Karma Cream1025 W. University Ave.
The zing of cayenne pepper instantly sur-
prises your tongue in this unconventional 
translation of the traditional hot chocolate. Other ingredients include cinnamon, co-coa powder and a vanilla syrup that gives it sweetness. Every part of the well-crafted hot chocolate tastes intentional and is certiﬁ  -ably organic. For an extra treat, pair it with the shop’s pumpkin spice donut that tastes like it just came out of your grandmother’s kitchen. 
S’mores latte at Patticakes9124 SW 51st Road Drizzled with Ghirardelli chocolate syrup 
and garnished with crushed graham crackers and brown sugar, this gourmet latte will sat-isfy any sweet tooth. It’s as if the best s’more you have ever had melted into a warm, liq-uid latte. Take your coffee to the shop’s out-
door tables that overlook the turning leaves 
on trees lining the brick pavement. 
Zombie latte at Coffee Culture2020 NW 13th St. You’ll instantly be ﬂ  ooded with memories 
of Halloween nights from the cinnamon aro-ma that coats the foam. The sweetness of the steamed milk blends together with hints of 
macadamia nut ﬂ  avor and seeps into a deep 
espresso. The intensity of the cinnamon spice outweighs the cream, producing a reﬁ  ned aftertaste. A whole latte fall-ﬂ  avored love

Former “The Cosby Show” and 
“That’s So Raven” child star “set the 
Twitter on ﬁ  re” Sunday night, accord-ing to Oprah Winfrey. 
Social media ignited in response to 
28-year-old Raven-Symoné’s sexual orientation and exhaustion with being labeled — she’s not gay, she’s a human who loves humans; she’s not African-American, she’s simply an American.
“Oh, my lord,” Winfrey said, as 
she shifted uncomfortably in her chair. “What did you just say? You’re going to get a lot of ﬂ  ak for saying you’re 
not African-American. You know that, 
right?” 
Raven said even though her ances-
tors are in Africa, she doesn’t know which country. But she does know her family’s roots are in Louisiana, which makes her an American — a colorless person. 
“(Raven) has a right to deﬁ  ne herself 
however she wants,” said UF director of African-American Studies Sharon Austin. “But it’s not so much the way she deﬁ  nes herself, it’s the way society deﬁ  nes her.”
During the Reconstruction Era, 
blacks were classiﬁ  ed by the “one-drop rule,” where regardless of pigmenta-tion, if a person had just one African ancestor, he or she was considered to 
be black. 
“That’s kind of still in effect now,” 
Austin said. “When people look at 
you, if you have even one distant rela-tive that is black, you are black. It’s not like that in other countries.” 
UF health education and behavior 
student Debra Gaskin said she doesn’t personally feel categorized by the one-
drop rule but instead from stereotypes 
associated with being black. 
“People get so used to different 
negative stereotypes being associated with a certain label,” the 19-year-old said. “That’s what makes them shy away from being labeled that way in the ﬁ  rst place.” 
Gaskin said she doesn’t take offense 
to Raven’s bold statement. She agrees that color lines are not gone. But unlike Raven, Gaskin doesn’t have a prefer-ence of what word to use in reference to her skin tone.
“Black, African-American, what-
ever people call it,” Gaskin said. “It’s all in the intent behind what the person is trying to say. If you call me African-American with the intent of demean-ing me, then yeah, I’ll be offended.”
Gaskin said she believes it’s human 
nature to label each other, and regard-less of Raven’s rebelliousness, labels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. 
Melissa Davis, administrative as-
sistant for the UF English department, agreed that societal labels aren’t going to disappear.
“We call people gay, we call people 
old, we call people ugly,” Davis said. “We, as humans, need to put a name to something.”
Davis said the most powerful state-
ment from Raven was simply “I’m an American,” and that’s the piece social media should spread like wildﬁ  re. 
“She’s saying ‘this is who I am ﬁ  rst.’ 
Like standing up and saying, ‘I’m a 
woman’ or ‘I’m a man.’ It’s a label, but 
it’s a label we can all wear.”

A dating platform that makes ﬁ  nding love easier for 
students recently looked through its users from colleges 
in Florida to ﬁ  nd out who were the pickiest when it came to dating. 
Coffee Meets Bagel, an interactive website that 
makes dating as simple as taking a trip to Star-bucks, found that female students at UF are more selective than males when it comes to dating. 
The free service, which was created in 2012, 
introduces members to singles close to their net-
work by using their Facebook accounts. Members 
are matched with someone every day at noon, and they have up to 24 hours to “like” or “pass” their match. More than 117,000 members from the top colleges in Flor-
ida — Florida State University, University of Miami, Uni-
versity of Central Florida, University of South Florida and 
UF — are using Coffee Meets Bagel.  
Although University of Miami students were the picki-
est, at UF, 70.9 percent of females passed their picks com-
pared to just more than half of male users.
Alexa Ruszkai, a UF communication sciences and dis-
orders freshman, said she is not surprised female students are picky when choosing someone to date. 
“I feel like UF girls are strong, independent and smart, 
and I think that makes us more pickier,” Ruszkai, 18, said. 
“We know what we want, and we don’t want to settle for 
something less, and a lot of UF girls have career goals and 
we want to ﬁ  nd someone that is compatible with that.”
Dawoon Kang, a co-founder of Coffee Meets Bagel, 
said the company likes to put out research and statistics like this because it can be exciting for the 
users on the site. 
“We want to make fun, yet informative content 
for our members and all singles out there,” she 
said, “but also use our content to understand and improve their dating lives because let’s face it, dat-
ing can be hard sometimes.” 
Elizabeth Buckley, a Gainesville clinical psychologist, 
said using dating websites can maximize your chances of connecting with someone, but there are some guidelines students should follow. 
“Like most endeavors in life, it’s a matter of responsi-
bility, safety and control,” she said. “This is a good time in 
life to begin practicing listening to your gut, if you haven’t 
been already.  If anything sounds weird in a proﬁ  le or in your email communications, it probably is.”Dating website ﬁ  nds UF females more 
selective than UF males when dating

Now is the time to start preparing for the 
holidays ahead. No, we don’t mean shopping 
or menu planning, which are good ideas by the way, but preparing for the social events 
ahead. Ways to fine-tune your social etiquette 
are to know how to give good toasts, a univer-
sal practice of honoring a person or occasion 
with an expression of goodwill and a drink. The holidays present many opportunities to 
give toasts with gatherings of friends and fam-
ily ahead, including parties, winter weddings 
and graduations.
Toasts occur in specific contexts, typically 
in conjunction with eating and always with 
guests or friends. The shared activity of drink-
ing alcohol tends to give the interaction infor-
mality and lowers inhibition, while toasting formalizes it and makes it a constructive social event. The toaster stands, lifts a filled glass, gives a toast to the guest of honor and ends 
with formulaic cheers. Guests signal their ap-
proval with the clinking of lifted glasses and a “hear, hear.” The final act of drinking, whether 
of alcohol or not, seals the ritual and bonds the 
group.
A basic condition, or felicity condition, in 
toasting is that the toast should express a wish regarded favorably by everyone at the group. 
Wedding toast scenes from romantic comedy 
movies often break this condition to provide 
comedic relief in a potentially stressful and 
emotionally high situation. For instance in the movie “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” a best 
man’s toast offsets the seriousness of the occa-
sion but is kept appropriate with its incorpora-
tion of praise and well-wishes to the couple.
The term toast also refers to the verbal ex-
pression accompanying the drink. There are 
short and long toasts, light-hearted and seri-
ous ones or explicit and implicit ones. Here are 
some, courtesy of Real Simple magazine:Toasting to the holidays aheaddrank

With a set that features bloody mannequins 
chained to walls and a bathtub full of bloody 
body parts and severed heads, the Hippo-drome State Theatre’s Halloween play isn’t scared of getting a little messy this year.
The Florida premiere of “Slasher” opens 
Friday night at the Hippodrome for $18 a ticket or $15 for students. It gives its viewers a horrifying and fun behind-the-scenes look at the production of horror films.
The play centers on Texan girl Sheena McK-
inney, played by Marissa Toogood, a Hippo-drome company actress.  McKinney is cast as the “Last girl” in a B-style horror movie called 
“Blood Bath,” directed by a D-list Hollywood 
director. It might have been her big break into show business if her crazy, drugged-up, activ-ist mother didn’t show up to try to stop the filming by any means necessary.
You never know what’s going to happen, 
especially with the Halloween shows, Too-good said. The director, Lauren Caldwell, didn’t impose too much on the actors and let 
them create their own character portrayal.
“You can’t help but love it,” Toogood said.
Gainesville loves Halloween, Caldwell said, and the Hippodrome has made a com-mitment to producing a Halloween-themed play every year for the past decade.
Almost 95 percent of the Halloween plays 
that the theater puts on are fun or spoofs. “Slasher” spoofs horror movies by using every campy horror trope, Caldwell said, complete 
with punchy one-liners, light shows and spe-
cial effects that fling blood like fruit at a Gal-lagher show.
Despite the light-hearted feel, the play is 
about the lengths people have to go to when in dire financial need or when they need a second chance, she said. Between the director, who desperately needs one last break, and a woman looking for revenge, it’s not certain 
who’s going to win.
There are also more subtle references to 
popular horror movies and punch lines in this 
play than in popular spoof-horror movies like “Cabin in the Woods” or “Scream,” Caldwell said. 
“You won’t scream,” she said. “But you’ll 
die laughing.”
For more information about the play or to 
buy tickets, go to thehipp.org, or call the box office at 352-375-4477.Blood, a D-list film director, a drugged-up mom and moretheater

“Slasher,” a behind-the-scenes spoof of the production of horror films, premieres at

Billy Donovan knows he has to re-
build. 
After ending a history-making 2013-14 
season at the NCAA Final Four tourna-
ment, Florida men’s basketball program starts this season as a very different team — with a similar set of high expecta-tions.
As he begins his 19th year coaching 
the Gators, Donovan looks to manage  those high expectations and build a team that is strong enough to face the chal-lenges ahead.
“I think they’re hopeful they can get 
back to that point, but they haven’t had to face a lot of adversity,” Donovan said. “Personally, maybe at different points in 
time they did, but we never faced a lot of team adversity.”
This season starts off with a heavier 
dose of adversity than last. Florida’s 
greatest challenge will be replacing the presence of four starting seniors, on and off the court.
“We’ve talked a lot about this in the 
off-season, not to say we’re going into 
the year hoping to lose or face adver-sity, how you respond to those things

Antonio Morrison is on a hot streak.
The junior linebacker totaled a ca-
reer-high 14 tackles during Florida’s 
30-27 loss to LSU.
Morrison’s previous career-high 
tackle total was 12 set against LSU on 
Oct. 12, 2013.
“He played well,” 
redshirt senior line-backer Mike Taylor 
said. “He was flying around to the ball, 
hitting people, get-
ting people to the ground.”
Morrison leads the 
Gators with 46 total tackles and has racked up double digit tackles in ev-ery Southeastern Conference game this season.
“He is playing his best football since 
he’s been here,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said.
“He’s got to continue to do that. 
We’re counting on him to do that. He’s 
a guy that takes his job and what we do 
very seriously. He puts a lot of time into it and I think it shows how he plays. He spends time on football a bunch outside of when he has to be here in meetings 
and practice. I think it’s showing.”Morrison

After the match’s first set, it appeared as if 
South Carolina would be the first Southeast-
ern Conference team to hand Florida a loss this season.
But the Gators responded with three 
straight victories to extend their winning streak to eight games and keep their confer-ence record unblemished. No. 8 Florida (13-3, 7-0 SEC) defeated 
South Carolina (13-5, 3-3) 3-1 Wednesday, receiving help from a variety of players to se-cure the win.
Despite limited playing time before the 
match, junior Ziva Recek finished with a sea-son-best 12 kills, two blocks and a .357 hitting percentage.
“The story of the match is Ziva,” coach 
Mary Wise said. “She comes in off the bench. … She raised her level, she did exactly what we asked our players to do. When your num-ber is called, take advantage of it. (Wednes-day) Ziva really answered the call.”
The match was tied 9-9 in the first set before 
the Gamecocks scored four straight points. From there, South Carolina out blocked Flori-da and the Gators never regained the lead. UF dropped the first set 25-19 and fell into a 0-1 hole. With the first set victory, South Carolina 
joined LSU as the only two SEC teams to win a set against Florida this season.
“Early on we just didn’t dig balls,” Wise 
said. “We were hitting balls out of bounds. I Recek has season-best outing in Gators win over GamecocksSee hoopS, p Age 15

UF coachthink we were just pressing too 
hard.”
Florida turned the momentum 
in the second set, at one point go-ing on a 9-2 run to take a 20-13 
lead. 
Soon after, the Gators tied the 
match at one with a 25-18 victory. After hitting .395 in the first, 
South Carolina never got close 
to its initial hitting clip for the re-
mainder of the match.
“The big difference in the 
match was when we started lim-
iting (South Carolina’s) offense,” Wise said. “First set, they’re hit-ting .395. and then from there they didn’t hit over .100. We needed to make an adjustment… and that we did.”
Florida jumped out to a 16-11 
lead in the third set before cruis-ing to a 25-13 win. After a back and forth final set, the Gators captured the victory with a 25-19 fourth set win.
Alex Holston was a large part 
of the victory and finished with 19 kills, eight digs and two service aces. Junior Mackenzie Dagostino contributed 48 assists and four to-
tal blocks.
“When you play a team that’s 
playing that well, that low error, I 
mean there’s no room for error,” Wise said. “It’s a win on the road against a team that played well. I’ll take it.”THURSDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Chris Walker is suspended for first three games
is going to be really important,” Donovan 
said. “There’s no doubt in my mind Scot-tie (Wilbekin) had the year he had because 
he responded the right way to adversity. … 
Same thing with Patric Young.  Same thing 
with (Casey) Prather, Will (Yeguete).  All 
those guys responded well to that.”
Donovan is hopeful one of the younger 
leaders of his team will respond well to early adversity this season.
Sophomore Chris Walker is suspended 
from the team for the first three games due 
to a violation of team rules, Donovan con-
firmed Wednesday. 
Walker will miss an exhibition game 
against Barry and two home games against 
William & Mary and Miami.
“It’ll be tough, but I can get through it,” 
Walker said.
Walker said he hasn’t spoken to Wil-
bekin, who faced a similar suspension at the start of last season, but he plans on reaching 
out to him.
Regardless of the late start, Donovan 
believes Walker’s greatest challenge this 
season will be managing the high expecta-
tions the Gators fanbase have placed on the young forward from Bonifay, Fla.
“Chris Walker played four minutes a 
game, all of a sudden everybody is expect-ing him to be a savior in the front court,” Donovan said. “I can’t really tell you he is ready to handle that or capable of handling 
that or is in a position to handle that.”
Sophomore center John Egbunu has been 
a big addition to Florida’s roster — literally 
and metaphorically. The Nigeria native is 
the tallest and heaviest player on the roster. 
At 6-foot-11 and 266 pounds with a wing-span of about 7-foot-4.
Egbunu is sure to make an impact — if 
he gets to play. 
Egbunu is a transfer from the University 
of South Florida, so the Gators are in the process of petitioning the NCAA to grant him immediate eligibility .
“I would say that right now, if I had to 
guess, it’s probably leaning more towards him having to sit out this year,” Donovan said. “We’re going to exhaust all of our av-enues and see where it leads us.”
As a freshman at USF, Egbunu started 
31 of the Bulls’ 32 games, averaging 6.2 re-bounds and 7.4 points per game.
Donovan said freshman guard Brandone 
Francis has yet to be admitted to UF. Francis will not compete in the 2014-
2015 season.
“There’s things he has to do academi-
cally while he’s here to get himself eligible to play,” Donovan said. “If he progresses in his first semester like we hope he will, he’ll 
be allowed to come back to practice for the 
second semester.”
DeVon Walker is out for the season with 
an ACL injury he suffered in July.
Junior forward Alex Murphy won’t 
likely see any action on the court until the spring semester. Donovan expects the mid-year transfer from Duke in 2013-14 to sit out the first eight or 10 games until he’s cleared 
from NCAA transfer regulations.
Donovan said he is pleased with the 
positive direction he has seen Eli Carter 
moving towards. He said the redshirt ju-
nior guard would be “much, much better in 
terms of his availability this year.” Carter, who missed most of last season while he was rehabbing a leg injury, is recovering from a little bit of an ankle injury, Donovan 
said.
“He has a bone bruise right now that 
shouldn’t slow him too much,” Donovan 
said. “But he could be limited the first cou-
ple days of practice.”hoops , from page 14

Sophomore Chris Walker poses during the 2014 men’s basketball media day on Wednesday in the basketball practice facility. 
Walker is suspended for UF’s first three games of the season due to a violation of team rules.
Neal embracing playmaker 
role: Keanu Neal needed some 
time to adjust.
The safety rarely played deep 
in the backfield during his time at Bushnell (Fla.) South Sumter High, so he never had as much 
responsibility in terms of cover-
age.
But after more than a year 
learning under coach Will Mus-champ, Neal has made strides 
throughout his sophomore 
year.
Through five games, Neal 
has a team-high three intercep-
tions and a fumble recovery for 
a touchdown in addition to 23 tackles and two pass breakups.
“He has been a guy that, it 
took him a little more time than 
it does others as far as scheme 
and to adjust and play the ball down the field,” coach Will Muschamp said on Wednes-
day’s SEC coaches’ teleconfer-
ence. 
“But he has got really good 
ball judgment. He can finish on plays. He’s a very good tackler. He has very good instincts in 
the box and in the deep part of 
the field. He has improved his communication skills tremen-dously. 
“He is a very hard self-evalu-
ator, as a matter of fact probably too hard on himself at times. But he is a guy that continues to improve, gets better every prac-
tice. He goes out and he’s got 
a tremendous work ethic. I’ve coached a bunch of good safe-ties and he’s going to be right up there with them at the end 
of the day.”
Injury update: Leon Orr is 
set to return to Florida’s lineup 
on Saturday against Missouri.
The redshirt senior defensive 
lineman has missed the Gators past two games since getting his 
knee scoped.
Despite his absence, UF’s 
defensive line has progressed, 
racking up 10 sacks in the last two weeks.
“The guys that have been 
playing up front have been playing really well,” Durkin said. “I’m really happy with our 
rotation up front and obviously 
bringing him back just adds one more healthy body to the rota-tion, which is always a good thing. We’ll see how he does.”footbALL ,

If anyone deserves to have a great senior 
year, it’s Karina Gutsche.
After playing in only one game during her 
freshman season at UF, Gutsche fought to get 
playing time in her sophomore year. She suc-
ceeded, ultimately appearing in 17 games.
By her junior season, she had earned the 
starting center back position. She started every 
match and averaged 85.5 minutes per game, the second most among her Gator teammates.
After three years of climbing the mountain, 
it was time to savor a sweet senior season.
No. 5 Florida (11-2, 6-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) travels to Columbia, S.C., to face the 
Gamecocks (9-4-1, 2-3-1 SEC) tonight, and 
coach Becky Burleigh said she hopes Gutsche will be able to continue doing what the senior has wanted to do all season: contribute on the ﬁ  eld.
Instead of leading the 
back line for the ﬁ  fth-ranked Gators, Gutsche has seen more time on the bench this 
season than on the ﬁ  eld.
She sprained her MCL 
during preseason and was 
forced to miss the ﬁ  rst six 
games before returning in Florida’s game against New Mexico as a substitute.
She continued to play in the team’s next 
two games as a substitute before getting the start against Missouri.
Finally, she was about to regain her role at 
center and have the season everyone had ex-pected — the swan song she had earned.
But after playing only 37 minutes, Guts-che suffered a head injury while going for a ball with a Missouri player and was taken off ﬁ  eld.
She was back on the bench for two games.For anyone else, the discouragement would 
almost be unbearable.
But for someone like 
Gutsche, who has always embraced challenges, one more wasn’t enough to dampen her positivity.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely been a battle, just getting 
through the fact that it’s my senior year,” Gutsche said. “But it’s also been a fun journey, just because my role has changed, not only as 
a player but as a person.”
Part of that role has been her leadership, 
and even though she hasn’t been on the ﬁ  eld, 
she’s helped her teammates.“I think I’ve deﬁ  nitely become more vocal. 
Just from being able to watch so many games, I can see the things that certain people need to work on,” she said. “With my MCL injury, I focused mainly on Claire (Falknor) and Chris-ten (Westphal), just trying to help them.”
Gutsche was able to return to the starting 
lineup against Mississippi State on Oct. 10 - putting in 45 minutes - and she will be look-ing to see more minutes as the Gators try to ﬁ  nish the last ﬁ  ve games of the regular season strong. 
“It’s so frustrating because obviously she 
spent the beginning of the season injured, came back, and as soon as she came back got 
injured again,” Burleigh said, “but hopefully 
that’s all behind us now and she’ll be in the ﬂ  ow of things, because I think she’s an impor-tant part of what we do.”

SWIMMING
�FLORIDA IS 25-0 AGAINST 
KENTUCKY.
AARON FRIEDLAND
Alligator Writer @aafriedland
For the ﬁ  rst time this year the 
Florida men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving team (M: 1-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference; W: 2-0, 2-0 SEC) will hit the road to face 
off against Kentucky (M: 0-1, 0-1 
SEC; W: 1-0, 1-0 SEC) tonight at 7. 
The Gators are coming off a 
win against LSU last Friday after claiming 23 of 32 total events. 
The Wildcats have only had one meet so far this season against South Carolina with the men com-
ing up short while the women 
came away victorious. 
UF remained undefeated all-
time against LSU at a combined 36-0 after last week’s meet, and Florida looks to do the same against UK as it boasts a 25-0 all-time record (14-0 M, 11-0 W).
The last time Florida and Ken-
tucky met was Nov. 8, 2007 when the men won 165-129 and the women 167-132. 
Florida features three players 
coming off SEC weekly honors as Jessica Thielmann was named SEC 
Female Swimmer of the Week, the  ﬁ  rst of her career, while Kahlia 
Warner was awarded her third 
career SEC Female Diver of the 
Week accolade.
Men’s freshman Caeleb Dressel 
earned the ﬁ  rst honor of his col-lege career after earning the SEC Male Freshman of the Week. 
Dressel already has three indi-
vidual victories this season and has been a part of ﬁ  ve winning re-
lay teams through two meets.
Coach Martyn Wilby has been 
pleased with what he has seen so 
far early into this season.
“The freshman men were very 
impressive can’t single any one 
of them out,” Wilby said. “But as a group, they are starting to un-
derstand what college dual meets 
are about and what college swim-
ming is about. Anybody that was there (against LSU), the ﬁ  nal event coach Troy set up the relays for the men by class and there was a lot of talk back and forth between the classes about who was going to win and the freshman men didn’t back down. They certainly knew 
what racing was all about.” 
As for the ﬁ  rst road meet of the 
season for this Gators team, it will 
be the ﬁ  rst for the freshmen class, which means a learning experi-ence. 
“The freshmen have never traveled before...both sides,” said Wilby. “So it’s a matter of explain-
ing to them what’s expected...little 
things. You pack your swimsuit in your carry-on, don’t put it under-neath the plane, it might not get there. Just little things like that, that we now take for granted but the freshmen don’t know how to do it.” 
While Florida will take its tal-
ented squads on the road for the ﬁ  rst time, it will be the ﬁ  rst test for the new class away from home and for coaches Gregg Troy and Martyn Wilby, how they respond and compete is how they will be 
evaluated.
