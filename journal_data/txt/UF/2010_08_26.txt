Political figurines removed from Ohio counter
NEWARK, Ohio (AP) — The elephant and the donkey are 
going into hiding at an Ohio voting board.
A Libertarian candidate saw ceramic figurines of the Re-
publican and Democratic symbols on the counter at the Licking 
County Board of Elections when he filed paperwork to run for county commissioner.
James Snedden Jr. says the display showed bias toward can-
didates for the two major parties. He filed a complaint with the board on Aug. 4. 
The animal figurines are now off the counter but still in the 
office.� For real-life tales

A man was arrested in connec-
tion to a credit card-skimming 
scam, which recorded credit card information from customers at 
at least four Alachua County gas stations. 
Luis Orlando Martinez Roque, 
24, was arrested in Orange Coun-ty  on Tuesday and awaits extra-dition to Alachua County. 
During a joint investigation 
by the Gainesville Police De-partment, the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Office and the United 
States Secret Service, Roque was 
identified as a sus-pect by surveillance 
video and witness 
accounts,  according 
to a GPD press release. Roque is 
accused of using the stolen credit card numbers to buy gas and oth-
er items, the release stated.
The Orange County Sheriff’s 
Office arrested him while he was 
sleeping in his girlfriend’s house. 
He was found with two fraudu-
lent cards yet to be linked with 
any known victims, the release stated.Roque is charged with identity 
theft and scheme to defraud and is held on $100,000 bond.
Authorities continue to warn 
locals to use caution when pay-ing for gas with credit cards. There is still a lot of work to be done while the investigation con-tinues, the release stated.Police catch suspected ‘skimmer scammer’  
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer
The Student Senate unani-
mously approved a nearly $2 million increase to the 2010-2011 Activity and Services Fee budget Tuesday night, bringing the total from about $14 million to nearly $16 million.
The increase comes after the 
state legislature’s June approval for a one-time hike in fees for the current fiscal year. A portion of the extra money will fund Student Government, the Reitz Union and RecSports. TJ Villamil, chairman of the Senate Budget and Appro-priations Committee, presented the bipartisan amendment, noting some increases in  salaries in SG-funded programs are necessary to keep up with state-mandated minimum wage increases.
The RecSports budget was in-
creased to accommodate the hir -
ing of about 150 new student staff members to work at Southwest Recreation Center after the expan-sion, he said.
Villamil, who represents the 
Unite Party, said 
he was pleased with broad sup-port for the amendment and the chance to address areas of concern.
Jonathan Os-
sip, Senate leader for the Student Alliance, also had high praise for the budget.
“The 2010-2011 budget is one 
of the better budgets I’ve seen,” he said.SG OKs budget for

Those who believe in strength in numbers 
might go into a panic when they see that UF 
is not the state’s largest university. 
The university’s enrollment rate has re-
mained constant since 2006, while other uni-versities in the state have grown. 
The University of Central Florida, for ex-
ample, has first-day enrollment numbers top-ping 56,000 students. 
Florida’s numbers have held steady at 
nearly 48,700, according to UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
But Orlando said the UF administration 
isn’t getting too worked up over the numbers gap.
“We’re not in a competition to be the big-
gest,” he said. “We’re interested in quality, not quantity.”
UF’s current goal is to provide the best ed-ucational experience possible, Orlando said.
A couple of the ways to do that, he said, 
are to decrease class sizes and maintain the university’s student-faculty ratio.
Facing budget cuts in 2009, the university 
had to cut down on faculty. In order to pre-serve the ratio, the university cut down on enrollment, as well.
For two years, the university made con-
certed efforts to decrease undergraduate en-rollment at the university while increasing graduate-student enrollment. 
“If you believe the faculty-student ratio is 
important, and you can’t hire more faculty, the only other way to impact that is to take 
less students,” said UF President Bernie Ma-
chen. “We didn’t have the resources to edu-cate as many students as we had.”
The university has stopped cutting down 
on students and instead is trying to keep a steady enrollment level as opposed to grow-
ing or shrinking, Orlando said.UF enrollment stays steady but not highest in state

As rain fell on the Reitz Union on 
Tuesday evening, dozens of students 
scampered under the colonnade. They 
joined about 60 other students who were looking for that perfect decoration to put in their rooms.
“Do you have a poster of that paint-
ing with the dogs playing poker?”
“Yeah, it’s in that book right there.”“Where’s that ‘Pulp Fiction’ post-
er?” 
“It’s the second book from the far 
end.” 
Jeff Apostolou, the manager for the 
College Poster Sale Company’s tours in 
the Southeast, has worked for the com -
pany for 25 years.
He knows where to find every one 
of the 2,000 posters offered during the 
sale. 
He organizes where the posters will 
be categorized before his company’s fall college tour. 
Someone asks Apostolou for help 
finding a poster about every five min-
utes every day of the sale, which started Monday and will continue every week-
day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. until Sept. 3.
Apostolou never leaves the Reitz 
Union Colonnade during that time. For 
lunch, he’ll eat a burger, but he eats it while standing at the poster sale. 
He’s also there until he puts the post-
ers in storage, which usually lasts until 
9 p.m.
Monday was one of his more stress-
ful days, he said. The rain and winds 
made handling the posters difficult.
Before visiting UF, the eight-week 
college tour stopped at the University of Georgia, which began classes Aug. 16. He said Athens, Ga., is his favorite stop because it’s a true college town with “funky clubs and nice coffee shops that aren’t corporate and homogenized.”
But one of the first colleges he visited 
was UF. He was 23 then.The Gallery, which is located on the 
second floor of the Reitz Union, is en-tirely funded by 20 percent of the pro-ceeds from the sale, according to Jill Keezer, assistant director for campus 
programs, which sponsors the sale.
The poster sale has been in existence 
for at least 30 years, Keezer said, be-
cause it was here when she came to UF 30 years ago.
There are about 1,000 customers a 
day, buying about two or three posters 
each, Apostolou said.
This year’s popular posters feature 
Li’l Wayne and “Inception.”
Each year, about 600 to 700 posters 
are switched out for new posters, he 
said.
Apostolou’s New York City apart-
ment doesn’t have posters hanging on the walls.
“You find that when you see a poster 
for eight weeks under intense, stressful circumstances that it’s not the most re-laxing thing to have on your wall.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 26, 2010

In Fracture’s headquarters in a 
north Gainesville industrial park, 
stained glass lines the walls. 
But it’s not the ordinary stained 
glass seen in church. 
This is a new type of stained 
glass, one that Fracture co-founder Abhi Lokesh, a 22-year-old Gator 
alumnus, hopes will revolutionize the way people print photos.
Lokesh founded the company 
with fellow Gator graduate Alex Theodore.
 A Fracture is a picture that 
combines a picture frame and the image into a singular item.
When users upload an im-
age onto the website, www.frac-tureme.com, the customer’s im-age is then printed onto a sheet of glass at a size of his or her choos-ing. 
After the glass is printed, a 
mountable foam backing is added to it, which results in a border-less, glossy photo that can be wall- or 
desk-mounted.“People don’t have that clean, 
elegant, simple option,” Lokesh 
said. “And that’s where we feel like we’ve stepped in and solved that problem.”
Fractures can also be purchased 
with borders. But “the most popular border is no border,” he said.
Fractures can be anywhere in 
size from 5 by 7 inches to 11 by 14 inches.
The company takes custom 
orders that can be as big 18 by 24 inches, which is as much as the 
current printer can handle, ac-
cording to Lokesh. Non-custom sizes range from $8 to $25.
Ultimately, the goal of the com-
pany is to be able to make Frac-tures the size of desks, windows and even doors.
Fractures are included with ev-
erything needed to mount, which 
is just a screw that is drilled into 
the wall. 
They have a wall-mounting 
system cut into the foam back-
ing, which allows for them to be mounted easily.
“The only thing you should 
worry about when you buy a 
Fracture is where you’re going to hang it,” Lokesh said of his prod-
uct’s placement.
If people want to mount it 
on their desk, that is an option 
as well. Instead of having a wall 
mount for the art, they will cut 
desk mount.
If people want both mounting 
options, Fracture will also create one that has both, but it has to be 
custom ordered.
The glass panels are also shat-
terproof, Lokesh said. Gator alumni forgo framing, print art on glass

Once again, Gators are gaining interna-
tional recognition, but this time it’s not for 
sports or partying — it’s for brotherhood.
The UF chapter of Delta Upsilon fraterni-
ty was awarded the  Most Improved Chapter Award at the yearly DU Leadership Institute. The chapter’s hard work and dedication set it apart from the 75 other chapters throughout North America, said Eric Weber, who serves as the chapter’s vice president of public rela-tions.
“It had a lot to do with recruitment,” We-
ber said.
In the past year and a half, the chapter has 
grown from 12 brothers to 56. 
“[Getting the award] also had to do with 
all the service events that our frats partici-pated in [and] how we embodied the four 
founding principles, which are promotion of 
friendship, diffusion of liberal culture, devel-opment of character and the advancement of 
justice,” he said.
The chapter also won third place in Best 
Overall Chapter.
Josh Fletcher, a sociology senior and vice 
president of membership education for the chapter, said it is a great honor to be recog-
nized by their fellow brothers.
“I thought we were going to get runner-
up, actually,” he said. “It’s an amazing feel-
ing after our hard work.”
Fletcher said he and his brothers will con-
tinue to work hard to recruit members, be-come more involved on campus and apply 
for more awards.
“We’re just trying to go all out as much as 
we can,” he said. “Next year, we’re going to 
try to get the Chapter of the Year.”Delta Upsilon

Gators football player Jeff 
Demps’ favorite Gatorade fla-
vor is lemon-lime. He cites the 2008 BCS National Champion-ship win as his favorite mo-
ment as a Florida Gator. He also 
joked that he listens to country music before games.
These were the kinds of 
things about 500 students learned about the Florida foot-ball team at a town hall forum held at Holloway Touchdown Terrace inside Gate 7 of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
At the forum, students had 
the opportunity to ask ques-tions about the football team’s 
plans for this season, team strat-
egies and players’ 
future plans. 
“From the be-
ginning, it was 
great to coach the Gators,” Meyer said. “I found out peo-ple in the South take things real serious.”
The forum began at 7 p.m. 
and lasted for about an hour and a half. 
Students, however, lined up more than an hour before the forum’s commencement, as the line stretched past Gate 4 at about 6:20 p.m. 
“I have season tickets this 
year, so I felt I just had to come and learn what will go on in the 
season,” said Ebony Cooper, a 
health education and behavior junior. 
Offensive Coordinator Steve 
Addazio ended the forum by speaking to students the way he does to prepare players in the locker room before a game. 
“We have a chance to one 
more time strap on that Gator helmet, baby,” he yelled as his voice bounced off the walls of Touchdown Terrace. Meyer hosts student forum
Enrollment is up 13,000 since 1990
“The original plan that I announced was a 
four-year plan,” Machen said. “And we were go-
ing to go down significantly, by about 4,000. We stopped it after two years. Basically, we felt like we had our budget under control, and frankly, I couldn’t afford to lose any more tuition money. … So this year’s freshman class, if we did it right, should be almost the same as last year’s freshman class.”
And it is. The freshman class this year is 6,400 
strong. 
Last year’s freshman class had about 6,300 stu-
dents, according to Orlando.
Over the past 20 years, UF total enrollment has 
grown by about 13,000, according to the UF web-site.
The growth gave the university the reputation 
of being one of the largest in the U.S.“Our goal was never to be the biggest,” Orlan-
do said. “We simply were.”
In the coming years, UF will be focusing on 
bringing in students through distance learning or online programs, he said.
If that is the case, the university may bring in 
more students, but the enrollment numbers won’t 
grow. 
According to Andy McCol-
lough, the associate provost for e-learning and distance educa-tion, online students are not counted in the enrollment sta-tistics.
“Everyone talks about UF 
having 50,000 students,” Ma-
chen said. “We’re really closer to 48,000. And hopefully, the resources are the same, so the stu-dents that are here can still have access to the re-sources.”ENROLLMENT , from page 1OnCampu s

Editor apologizes for 
unfortunate typo
We’re sure you’ve heard about Wednesday’s front-page 
nightmare of a typo — and if you haven’t, we aren’t 
going to repeat it.
Despite the overwhelming urge to pretend it never hap-
pened (or wait for financial aid to pay out and flee the country), 
the Editorial Board decided the Greek community — and the 
student body — deserves both an apology and an explanation.
We’re sorry . As for the explanation, we know most of you won’t believe 
it, but here it is: Sometime between the end of the summer and the beginning of the fall semester, our computers decided to 
make our lives a living hell by freezing every time we try to do 
anything. When we’re typing and the computers freeze, some-
times it takes so long to unfreeze that we completely forget what we were trying to do when it froze. Last night, the Spirits of Alligator Past decided it would be hilarious to drop an anvil 
on an already strained relationship with Greek Gators and let 
us replace an innocent word like “hopeful” with one a little less harmless.
But we promise: It was an accident. Trust us — if it hadn’t 
been us who had made the mistake, we’d never believe that it 
wasn’t a malicious joke. But if you had seen the looks on our fac-
es or felt how our stomachs dropped when we noticed, you’d know that it was just a mistake — a horrible mistake that has had our entire staff grimacing in pain at every mention of it. 
We feel terrible, and we know our technical difficulties aren’t 
an excuse for carelessness. But we hope that the women of Al-pha Epsilon Phi and the rest of the students can forgive us.  
And come on, admit it — you laughed.
Obama: a leader who doesn’t lead?
A leader, above all else, has a responsibility to those he 
or she governs.
A good leader recognizes discrepancies with an 
agenda and makes necessary or appropriate adjustments.
As a whole, President Barack Obama’s actions  have left 
many to speculate his motives. Does the president act with a certain first-term naiveté, or does he simply view himself as above the American presidency?
President Obama was elected at a convenient time of bub-
bling dissatisfaction with the political status quo.
Relatively inexperienced, Obama ran on a campaign of 
hope and change for the sake of hope and change, offering little substance for either in his campaign addresses. Obama was launched into the presidency after the economic collapse 
and acted with reckless fervor, pushing highly contested leg-
islation through Congress without allowing the citizen avail-ability he promised during his campaign.
Since that point, Obama has caught the nation off guard, 
taking actions either adverse to his campaign commitments or outside the parameters of the will of the nation. Contrary to his campaign promises, Obama refused to allow five days of public comment before signing bills; has not reduced ear -
marks to the 1994 level; and families below the $250,000 in-
come level have seen taxes increase despite his promise they 
wouldn’t see “any form of tax increase.”
The health care bill alone will raise billions of dollars on 
the backs of the middle class. And that doesn’t include the tobacco taxes Obama has increased or the forthcoming expi-ration of the Bush tax cuts, which will mean an additional tax burden for many families Obama claimed were in his tax-safe zone. Remember Obama: the community organizer? Obama: the man of the people? Obama: the struggling middle-class 
citizen’s answer to economic hardship? 
Consider the following:
Despite advocating the virtues of a public education, his 
children attend a private school. 
His wife vacationed in five-star luxury in Europe while the U.S. went through its toughest economic time since the Great Depres-sion. 
Obama has had more golf outings 
in 18 months than President Bush took 
in eight years. 
If Nero fiddled while Rome burned, 
Obama golfs while the economy tanks.  
Meanwhile, America’s willingness to rely on paper-thin reassurances from 
the president that he is acting with a sense of positive change, and that there is still hope for the economy are wearing thin. Obama’s greatest defense, his blame-Bush Kevlar, is fraying and leaving his true lack of experience exposed.
The president’s flagging interest in the will of the people 
is highlighted by his comments on the Ground Zero mosque situation.  Similarly, he was deaf to public sentiment when it came to health care and bailout legislation.
Does a detached attitude about the issues at hand have 
the president already dreaming beyond his presidency? Has he already set his sights toward a post-service role in Amer -
ica or the world?  In January, Obama made a statement to ABC’s Diane Sawyer that indicated a one-term presidency is 
not beyond his contemplation. 
Perhaps he has realized remaking the country as he sees 
fit is not so easily achieved.
 The nation’s highest office comes with the heaviest bur -
dens. However, the stresses of leadership will turn destruc-
tive and self-defeating if the actions of a leader are not syn-chronized with the will of the nation.
At times, a leader needs to reflect upon the decisions he 
has made and determine whether they reflect the best inter -
est of the governed body . 
The question at hand is both simple and profound. Will 
our president make the changes in his agenda that Ameri-cans are about to mandate in November?

evening, Lohan served only two weeks locked up and 22 days in a we-can-only-guess-totally-posh-UCLA-Medical-Center rehabilitation pro-gram.
But before anybody gets 
too peeved over an apparent 
slap on the wrist for our “Par -
ent Trap”-turned-”Inferno” 
starlet, the jails were over -
crowded and Lohan was acting, according to sources, in her very best DUI-convict behavior. We can only imagine what 
Lohan’s manicurist-turned-
calligraphist fashioned to 
warrant “good behavior.”
And while she was locked 
up worse than Akon, put-ting on her very best behav-ior, Lohan didn’t even have cell phone privileges and was treated “like a common criminal,” according to her 
mother, Dina. 
Well, Dina, she is. 
After being convicted for 
driving under the influence and kind-of-sort-of taking that whole ankle bracelet thing seriously, perhaps a smidgen of common criminal action would set our Mean 
Girl straight.
It’s time for Hollywood to 
wake up and realize no one, 
not even the very Lindsay Lohan, is above the law. Serv-ing only 20 percent of a sen-tence is unacceptable.
We can only hope the jail 
let Lohan wear her pink shirt 
on Wednesdays.

For many college students, Labor Day means the end of a 
summer job or summer fun, the start of a new school year and perhaps the kickoff of
the college football season.Historically, Labor Day, which unlike other American 
holidays does not recognize any particular group, event, indi-vidual or battle, celebrates workers and their contributions to our nation. But I think Labor Day is also a time to recognize the struggles of working people. Especially now, when despite significant gains, workers and students are feeling more anxi-ety than festivity . It has taken a lot of work to get the economy headed on a path to recovery . This is not just the responsibility of the Labor Secretary or leaders in Washington. There is a role for everyone, including college students. Here are a few ways 
you can help: 
Expand Your Circle.  As President Barack Obama has made 
federal student aid, including Pell Grants, available to unem-
ployed workers, there will be more “non-traditional” students on campus.  From the former auto worker studying to be a nurse, to the single mother who is earning a degree at night or on weekends, there is no such thing as a “typical” college student anymore as workers re-enter ac-ademic institutions of all types to retool and retrain. That’s good for colleges, very good for workers and even better 
for you!  Get to know fellow students — especially those who don’t look exactly like you. Support Your Peers. You may also see more veterans of every age on campus. Student veterans groups are forming on campuses to provide peer-to-peer net-
works, sponsor events and activities and make sure veterans 
are successful at school and, later, at work.  Learn more about how you can get involved in these efforts at www.studentvet-erans.org. And you can help yourself while helping others, too. Disabled American V eterans (www.dav .org) offers a $15,000 scholarship for volunteers who provide at least 100 hours of service to local V A hospitals in a year. 
Share Your Passion. My department runs Job Corps, one of 
the country’s largest networks of residential educational/vo-
cational training programs. It helps more than 100,000 young 
people learn the skills for a great career and earn a high school diploma every year. Many of the 123 Job Corps centers around the country have volunteer opportunities (check out www.serve.gov).
Find a Job Corps student who is interested in the same ca-
reer as you and become a mentor or tutor. The serve.gov web-site can also help you find other volunteer opportunities where the needs are greatest. The unemployment rate for people with 
disabilities is more than 16 percent.Hundreds of organizations 
that serve this important com unity need your help in a variety of job skills and readiness programs. This is a great way for you to put your unique talents to work, hone your own skills, sharpen your focus and help others.
Get “Green” Now. Earn Green Later. Get involved in the 
efforts to “green” your campus or community . We’re making significant investments in a whole new American industry: clean energy . Our goal is to reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil and re-energize our manufacturing sector to create jobs for 
today as well as jobs for tomorrow. I hope that you will make Labor Day 2010 a day on instead of a day off.
There’s nothing wrong with making time for barbecues and 
the big game, but let’s make time for each other, too.  Let’s all do the work that will get America working.
Hilda L. Solis is the United States Secretary of Labor.

UWire Finally.
After an arduous journey, America fi-
nally took an enormous step in the right 
direction for gay rights. While we were all on 
summer vacation, a judge in California ruled that the statewide ban on same-sex marriage 
was unconstitutional and discriminatory.
In case you’ve been under a large rock, the 
state of California has been dealing with the 
aftermath of Proposition 8 — a constitutional amendment passed in November 2008, which 
kept marriage between a man and a woman.
“For the family” and “traditional values” supporters have tried to push gay individuals into a second-class-citizen world in which gay 
weddings erode the “sanctity of marriage.”
To them, people like me need to be called 
“homosexuals” in that pious tone. We are 
abominations in need of a cure.
We’re more than “disco-dancing queens” 
and “sex-crazed freaks.”
We’re somebody’s son or daughter. We’re 
somebody’s husband, wife or lover. We’re Americans.
But most importantly: We’re people, peo-
ple who deserve the same rights. The part that bothers me the most 
about all of this is that 
the people who throw 
their “traditional fam-
ily values” in my face are using the Bible to defend themselves.
The Bible. A book written thousands of 
years ago. The same book that forbids men to associate with women on their periods, to shave, to wear cotton/polyester blend cloth-ing and many more everyday 21st century 
normalcies.
We can’t live in a country where people stand up every day and profess “freedom for all” when we take our laws from a religious 
book. That’s not freedom for all, that’s free-
dom for the religious.
Believing that people of the same sex 
shouldn’t marry and believing that people of 
the same sex shouldn’t have the right to marry 
are two different things.
Maybe one day equality will make its way 
across the map and, yes, even to Oklahoma. If 
so, maybe we can all together say: Finally.

High-end headphones combine style and technology
By JON SILMAN
avenue staff writer
I assumed I would be blown away 
by the sheer audio awesomeness of 
the Crossfade LP’s when I put them 
on for the first time. Something sur -
prisingly different happened. 
Every snare hit, background vo -
cal or ambient noise was audible. 
This creates a soothing sound expe -
rience, as opposed to an explosive 
one. 
I was able to test-drive these 
headphones courtesy of V-MODA. These over-the-ear headphones have a unique noise-canceling prop-erty that subtly isolates sound.
But the real beauty lies in the 
true representation of the music you’re listening to. I heard things in music I had never heard before. 
What makes the V-MODA Cross-
fade LP headphones ($249.99) bet-ter than those white ear buds you’ve been using? The answer lies in the 
range of frequency response, mea-
sured in hertz. 
The higher the range of hertz 
(cycles per second), the better the 
breadth of sound. Those white Ap-
ple earphones have a range of 20 to 20,000 hertz. The Crossfade’s range is from 5 to 30,000 hertz. What does this mean in terms of 
sound? Well, you can hear things 
with unusual clarity.
I put on some old Dr. Dre (The 
Chronic 2001) to test the bass, and 
the throbbing lines were immediate, 
but not the focal point. You hear everything as a full and complete piece of music. The droning diesel buzz of The National becomes more 
apparent, and you can’t help but 
get sucked into the dreary delight of it all. The new Arcade Fire album sounds as distant and airy as it 
was meant to be. I went on Groove -
shark to listen to some Mozart, and I couldn’t help but appreciate the beauty I was hearing.
The texture of the fabric is really 
comfortable, but my ears get hot 
with prolonged use. That’s probably 
my only complaint. It’s light and du -
rable, and you can use it to answer 
phone calls from your smart phone because it has a remote/mic cable with voice memo recording capabil-
ity that can also control Apple prod -
ucts (iPad, MacBook, iPod etc.).
The headphones come with a 
stylish carrying case, two detach-able Kevlar-reinforced cables (au -
dio only and remote/mic), a 1/4 
inch adapter for DJ and pro-audio capability and a one-year warranty. It comes in five colors: white pearl, 
phantom chrome, gunmetal black, 
nero or rouge.
If you have the money to spend, 
these headphones are some of the 
best in its price range. I didn’t know 
what I was missing.

My first love: tales of lust, pain 
By KAT BEIN
alligator writer
Love. Most of us know what it feels like. Or at least we 
think we know what it feels like.
This Friday, a movie called “Flipped” is hitting local 
theaters, and it’s about love. Specifically, that special 
kind of love we know as “first love.”
And in honor of what is guaranteed to be a sicken -
ingly cute and heart-warming fictional tale of first love in the ‘50s, we got the true, heart-breaking stories of three first loves from people walking our own streets.  
Enjoy.
Amber Keen , 23
“You may think when you’re 16 you’re in love. But 
then you get out of the relationship, and you realize you were just crazy and wanted a boyfriend.”
Keen said she’d had relationships before but didn’t 
really fall in love until she met Colin when she was 21.  
“I’d never felt how I felt about him then,” she said. “I couldn’t eat. I wasn’t even hungry because my stomach was in knots.”
They met in 2008 at the Gators football game against 
the University of South Carolina. He was in her seat, but when she asked him to leave, he wouldn’t. He’d rather squish himself between the screaming fans and talk to her about Nickelodeon shows and other “dorky stuff.”
But it was great, and they got together, and Keen had 
never been happier. 
When he graduated a few months later, he stayed in 
town to be with her. And when he moved to Birmingham, Ala., to study dentistry, they decided to make it work even though Keen never had thought long-distance relation -
ships were a good idea before.
“But we had a plan,” she said. “I was graduating soon, 
and the plan was I’d move up and be with him.”
Things were so serious between the two that they 
went looking at rings together. But they never bought one. And that was probably for the best because after a while, things started to change. He became critical of Keen’s lifestyle and didn’t approve of her partying.
“Distance pulls people apart. And for us, we just kind 
of grew apart,” she said. “We were changing as people. People change, but we didn’t change together.”
It’s been about a month since Keen and Colin sepa -
rated, and she said she’s no longer looking for something serious.
“I have my whole life to be married to someone,” she 
said. “It’s important to give yourself that time.”
Since the breakup, Colin has e-mailed her saying he’s 
sorry for everything he said to hurt her. But she hasn’t responded yet. She’s too busy feeling “liberated.” 
Still, she’s quick to say her relationship with Colin was 
the best she’s ever had.
“I told him if we’re meant to be, we’ll be together 
down the line,” she said. “At the moment, I feel like I did the right thing.”
Lea Cline, 32Cline was 23 and going to graduate school in Austin, 
Texas, when she met Dylan through a fledgling dating site created for students — something that wasn’t so normal 10 years ago.
“Back then it was really edgy,” she said. “It was kind 
of the hip thing to do.”
She and Dylan hit it off like magic, “the result of being 
at the right place at the right time.” He was cool and sure of himself, knew who he was and what he wanted, and she was attracted to that.
They were together for three years. They, too, went ring shopping and actually bought one. They were going to get engaged.
And that’s when they fell out of love.
“We had become this unit,” she said. “We were going 
and grew into this relationship that wasn’t fun anymore. 
It was like a job. You make these sacrifices because 
that’s what you do.”
Cline said they kept making adjustments to their per -
sonalities, trying to make themselves fit into what the other had pictured in their minds until one day Dylan 
couldn’t take it anymore.
“He realized, ‘I can’t be who you want me to be for -
ever,’ and I realized the stakes were too high,” she said.
But in the end, Cline knows it was the right decision. 
Dylan got married, and she got a Ph.D.
“You get your confirmation later on,” she said. “It was 
formative to know that I could love someone that much, 
but I also had to love myself.”
Lester Smilowitz, 62When Smilowitz met his first real love  — the love that 
changed his life — he’d already been married for four 
years.
And this “real love” wasn’t anyone like his wife. His 
name was Jeffrey.
“It was like, what you were supposed to do?” he said. 
“I wasn’t out of the closet. I was a homophobe. And when I met my wife, we just clicked. I was confused.”
His wife got the idea that she wanted to see 
a friend perform in a local drag show. He went along, and when she kept going back, so did he. 
It was harmless fun. A few trips later, a man asked him to 
dance, and that wasn’t so bad. 
Then he met Jeffrey. The first time he saw him was at 
Lake Wauburg.
“He was wearing pigtails with leather straps and cut-
off shorts,” he said. “I thought he was pathetically thin.”
But later, when Smilowitz was at a 
friends house, Jeffrey was there, and 
he just leaned over and kissed him, 
and that was it.
“He kissed me, and I woke up,” he 
said. “I was kind of like Snow White.”
Smilowitz and Jeffrey started hanging out more until 
Smilowtiz started staying the night. Things with his wife were going south. She was becoming involved in a cult-
like church, and he was, well, sleeping with a man.
Smilowtiz and his wife split up. He moved out of his 
house and in with Jeffrey, which “turned out to be the 
worst thing that ever happened in my life.”
“He was a player, and he played me,” he said. “He 
expected this love to be like the one he had with his wife, 
but it wasn’t.
“It was a roller coaster ride down,” he said. “To this 
day, I can’t think about him without cringing.”
But without Jeffrey, who knows how long it would have 
taken Smilowtiz to become comfortable with himself — to show the world who he really was inside. And in the end, 
he’s not bitter.
“What I’ve learned about love is that it has nothing to 
do with the other person,” he said. “It’s an emotion we’re 
capable of … we’re not a victim of it ... I don’t believe that.”
Since then, Smilowtiz has had real, meaningful re -
lationships with men who loved him back, for better or 
worse.
“It’s probably the greatest gift to be loved and give 
love,” he said. “Life is always better when you’re in 
love.”

aveToon Drop drab, add fab
By MARISSA PRIETO
avenue contributing writer
You’re adding and dropping classes like they’re 
going out of style — so why not apply that attitude 
to your personal style?
Now that school’s back in session, make sure 
you don’t get dropped like that boring professor 
with bad reviews (and no chili pepper) on Rate -
MyProfessors.com. It’s time to drop some of your 
dated duds from last semester, and add some new fashion pieces from this season to your ward-robe. 
ADDS: 1. First and foremost for the ladies: Show off 
the bikini bod you’ve been perfecting all summer with something form-fitting. Trade in your flowy 
summer frocks for tighter silhouettes, like a no-
frills dress.
2. Classes got you down? Brighten up your 
day — and your wardrobe — with a punchy, printed skirt paired with a solid top.
3. Tuck in your blouse under a pair of high-
waisted shorts or pants — it’s a simple but elegant ensemble.4. For both sexes: We’d say black is back, but 
it never really left. Keep it edgy — we dare you to 
wear black-on-black.
5. For guys who haven’t embraced the man 
purse so affectionately dubbed the “murse,” you 
can still carry your stuff with style. Throw on a pair of fitted cargo pants for some pocket perfection — but make sure they’re tailored to fit your body, lest you look like you just stepped out of your seventh grade yearbook photo. 
DROPS:
1. Yes, we know that even Chuck Norris wears 
Tebow pajamas to bed, but there’s a new quarter -
back in town (cue John Brantley). It’s time to retire 
the No. 15 jerseys to the back of your closet.
2. We heeded the words of Katy Perry all sum-
mer, but now it’s time to ditch your Daisy Dukes. Low-rise short-shorts are best saved for the beach, and Lake Wauberg doesn’t count. 
3. There’s no power in the flower this fall. 
Trade your floral-patterned clothes for tried-and-true plaid.
4. And on the topic of giving up your garden 
gowns: Lose the over-sized flower and bow-adorned hair accessories. 
5. Freshmen: It’s time to let go of your high 
school spirit tees. You’re a Gator now. 
Sorry, freshman: what they didn’t tell you at orientation
Dear Freshmen, 
I was once like so many of 
you: bright-eyed, bushy-tailed 
and eager to start college.
Now, here I sit, cynical and surly, 
about to start my (possibly) final year 
of undergrad. Let me regale you with a true story.
My first night on campus was spent 
wandering around with my friends, checking out all the awesome stuff 
(OK, not entirely true), when all of a 
sudden, someone leaned out of their car window and yelled “WELCOME TO 
FLORIDA, CHEESEDICKS!”
Shocked, stunned and slightly 
saddened, I realized that I had been lied to, as my penis was not made of 
cheese (I think, but I’m not an expert).
This is what college life does to you. 
It lies to you, draining your innocence until you end up an angry husk of a hu -
man being. However, I hope that some of you can make it through better than I have, and I’ll do my best to help by 
letting you in on some of the lies you 
will be told during your (hopefully) four year stay.
Lie No. 1: You will continue dating 
your high school sweetheart long-dis-tance.
If your significant other isn’t going 
to school in the same town as you, consider the clock ticking — and quick -ly. Sure, you might think 
you have it 
under con-trol, Skyping 
each other 
every night, constantly 
texting – 
those private phone con-
versations. Problem is, you’re about to meet more people in one week than you met during all of high school, 
and you’re going to realize that not 
being able to make out with any of these people sucks. Once you realize that this problem is caused by some -
one else you’re not able to make out 
with (since they’re hundreds of miles 
away), you’ll return to Gainesville from Thanksgiving break a few pounds 
heavier from food, but feeling lighter 
overall.
Lie No. 2: Your bachelor’s degree 
in liberal arts will mean something.
Consider the story of my room-
mate: He graduated last spring with a 
bachelor’s degree in English. He just 
spent his summer working graveyard shifts at Dunkin’ Donuts. There wasn’t 
any space for him to hang his diploma 
because the walls are covered with in-structions on how to fill the jelly dough-nuts safely. His supervisor never grad-uated high school. But hey, things are 
looking up for him: He got a better job 
as an office secretary.
Lie No. 3: You can have plenty of 
fun before you turn 21.
The most egregious lie of them 
all. Sure, Gator Nights can be fun (but 
only when there’s stand-up comedy in 
the Orange & Brew), but legally drink -
ing is where it’s at. Sure, you might 
know someone old enough to buy 
you booze, but you’re only getting the cheap stuff. Don’t worry, though, 
drinking cheap booze will only make 
drinking good booze feel even classier once you turn 21.

� SHOWERS IS FOURTH DB 
TO COMMIT TO 2011 CLASS.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
 
For UF, the secondary appears 
to be a primary priority.
The Gators added their fourth 
defensive back commit of the 2011 
recruiting class when Madison 
Heights (Mich.) Madison High three-star cornerback Valdez Show-ers orally committed Wednesday to Florida.
Showers said coach Urban Mey-
er was “fired up” by his decision.
Showers, rated as the 36th-best 
cornerback in the nation by Rivals.
com, said the opportunity to see the field early at UF played a role 
in his decision.
“I wanna come in and start as a 
true freshman,” Showers said. “As 
long as I go out there and work hard, I think I can do that.”
With cornerback Moses Jenkins 
and safety Ahmad Black's running out of eligibility, and the possibil-
ity of junior Janoris Jenkins enter -
ing his name in the NFL Draft at season’s end, UF will likely need 
added depth in the secondary.
 four of the Gators’ 15 commit-
ments for the 2011 class have been 
defensive backs.
Showers joins four-star pros-
pects Nick Waisome (Groveland South Lake High) and Louchiez Pu-
rifoy (Pensacola Pine Forest High) 
and three-star athlete De’Ante 
Saunders (Deland High) as UF’s commitments in the secondary.
Waisome, the No. 11 cornerback 
in the nation according to Rivals.com, made his pledge to play at 
Florida last week on a nationally televised special. He cited the rela-tionships he built with the Gators’ coaching staff as the biggest reason 
for his decision.
Purifoy com-
mitted to UF in 
July right before 
the team’s annu-
al Friday Night 
Lights camp. At the time, he was 
unranked by Rivals. 
However, when Rivals released 
the latest edition of its 250 best prospects in the class of 2011, Puri-
foy jumped to No. 116 overall and 
is ranked as the seventh-best cor -
nerback in the nation.Saunders, who is expected to 
play safety at Florida, was a four-star prospect earlier in the sum-
mer, but dropped in Rivals’ latest 
rankings. He is currently consid-ered the 20th-rated safety in the 2011 class.
“That’s a lot of talent coming  
(in the secondary),” Showers said. 
“Especially when you have a great 
school like Florida, you just gotta 
get out there and compete.”
UF offered Showers a scholar -
ship in June after his showing at 
one of the team’s summer camps. 
The 5-foot-11 cornerback didn’t 
pick UF solely because of the chance to have an early impact, though. 
The Michigan native chose the 
Gators because of the opportunity 
to play far away from home, even though his father wanted him to go to school nearby.
“Ever since I was a little kid, 
I just wanted to go out of state,” 
Showers said. “I never wanted to stay in state.  It had to be done.”
Showers, who spurned offers 
from at least nine other schools, in-cluding in-state program Michigan 
State, said he committed before 
his senior year started because his 
mom wanted him to focus on this 
season.
In the end, Showers said choos-
ing the Gators was tough. But af-
ter praying about it, he knew the connection he had with Florida felt right.
Oral commitments are non-bind-
ing until a national letter of intent is 
signed on or after National Signing 
Day.UF adds three-star cornerback to growing 2011 class

Hours after senior Mike Pouncey told 
the media the freshman class needs to 
“just shut their mouth and come play,” Ronald Powell and Dominique Easley 
didn’t come to play at all. 
According to a source close to the 
team, the two freshmen were upset with 
how the coaches came down on them during special teams practice Monday and didn’t show up for Tuesday’s prac-tice as a result. 
According to the source, both players 
threatened to transfer, but a UF official 
said neither Powell nor Easley asked the 
compliance department for their releas-es. 
Numerous media outlets, including 
Rivals.com and the Gainesville Sun, re-
ported Powell and Easley were back at 
practice Wednesday. 
Powell, a five-star defensive end and 
the No. 1 recruit in the nation accord-ing to Rivals.com, and Easley, a five-star defensive tackle, are part of a freshman 
class that has drawn some criticism from  
veteran players, such as Pouncey, who 
said the entire freshman class is “cocky.” 
Coach Urban Meyer told the media 
Monday he is concerned with the fresh-
men’s attitudes. 
“You have 25 young players — or 
whatever it is — that think they’re go-
ing to dominate the way they did in high 
school,” Meyer said, “and they have no 
idea what’s about to hit them.”
Easley compared himself, Powell and 
fellow freshman defensive lineman Shar -
rif Floyd to the Miami Heat’s free-agent 
haul. 
“Ronald Powell is Chris Bosh, Sharrif 
(Floyd) is Dwyane Wade and I’m LeBron (James),” Easley said at UF’s media day 
on Aug. 10. 
Quarterback John Brantley was the 
only member of the team to address the 
media Wednesday. He said he didn’t know if Powell and Easley missed prac-
tice Tuesday but that the veterans and 
freshmen are getting along.
“We’ve been mixing in with them 
fine,” Brantley said. “They came in here, they’re trying to make an impact, and you can’t really ask for anything more.” Powell, Easley return to practice after skipping Tuesday

For the Gators, creating scoring op-
portunities wasn’t a problem in their 
first weekend. 
Finishing off those chances was a 
different story, and No. 9 Florida (2-0-0) has been hard at work this week making sure it doesn’t become an issue that plagues the team for the rest of the 2010 campaign.
In two games, the Gators scored four 
goals. They took 34 shots, squandering numerous opportunities with only 13 shots on frame. 
“Our goal is to finish one in every 
seven opportunities,” UF coach Becky Burleigh said. “Right now we’re at one in every 11, so we’ve got some work to do.”
The Gators have assembled a young, 
menacing attack with playmakers at  ev-ery position, but sometimes their youth has shown. Sophomore attacking mid-fielder Erika Tymrak leads a talented group of creative players that can run at people and challenge defenders. 
Tymrak, along with forwards McK-
enzie Barney and Taylor Travis have created plenty of goal-scoring possi-bilities, but often the Gators failed to capitalize due to a poor shot or lack of patience. 
While the beautiful connection 
plays that have resulted in goals stand out, the missed opportunities are just as glaring. 
The Gators have taken 
nine more shots than their opponents, and earned 
12 corner kicks. But they have turned only one of the free kicks into a scoring chance and have rushed plays despite defenses dropping back.

Fans will have to wait until the sea-
son opener Sept. 4 to see which Florida 
pass catchers emerge as quarterback John Brantley’s weapons, but they should ex-pect to see wide receiver Omarius Hines on the field. Where exactly he will line up, however, remains a mystery.
Hines has worked at receiver and tight 
end throughout the preseason, and he even said Tuesday that he has lined up in the backfield. The latter position came as a surprise to everyone, including running backs coach Stan Drayton, who said he has not seen Hines take any snaps “back there.”
Coaches have confirmed he is playing 
tight end, though. And while he is still raw at the position, the 6-foot, 219-pound receiver has the physical tools to succeed, reminding some of a former Gator.
“He’s like a modern-day [Cornelius Ingram], but in a smaller form,” offensive 
lineman Carl Johnson said. “He’s too big 
for corners and too fast for linebackers, so 
he’s that hybrid player. It’s fun watching him, to see those little [defensive backs] try to tackle someone that big and see those 
linebackers try so hard but can’t even come 
close to catching him.”
Ingram hasn’t suited up for Florida 
since 2008, when he missed the whole sea-
son after suffering a torn 
ACL in his left knee. But 
Hines, who was redshirt-
ed that season, has spent more time watching film of last year’s starter, Aar -
on Hernandez.
The biggest differ -
ence in receiving the ball as a tight end is focusing 
more on ball protection, as the defenders waiting to hit him will be linebackers rath-er than smaller cornerbacks and safeties, Coaches working Hines at

constantly where teams are going 
to sit back on us,” keeper Katie Fraine said. “We just need to figure out that riddle. We just have to be patient.”
After studying film of their games against Miami and UCF, the Gators took note of the chances left on the field and have worked hard 
this week addressing the issue.
“We’re our toughest critics,” 
Tymrak said. “As time goes on 
we’ll finish our chances. I just think most importantly we are connect-ing and creating them.”
Tymrak was also quick to say 
nerves played a part in the first couple of games.
“We were a little jittery,” Tym-
rak said. “It’s going to improve.”
Many of the forwards and at-
tacking midfielders have been some of the first to arrive at practice this week, concentrating on finishing 
and shooting. Associate head coach 
Vic Campbell has worked individ-
ually with several of the players.
The Gators hope to get junior 
forward Lindsay Thompson, the team’s top goal scorer last season, 
on track. The gifted striker has tak-
en six shots in the two games, but has failed to put one in the net. 
“Lindsay has one of the best 
shots on the team,” Tymrak said. “She’ll come through.”
Despite the missed opportuni-
ties, Burleigh is pleased with the 
direction and approach the team is 
taking. Burleigh echoed Tymrak’s 
sentiment that it is a positive indi-
cation of the Gators’ ability to cre-ate chances. 
“It’s a really good sign,” she said. 
“More so than in the past. Now it is just a matter of finishing them.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 26, 2010

Hines said.
“There’s a lot more people around you now so you 
got to keep your head on a swivel as soon as you get the 
ball,” he said.
Regardless of where he plays, Hines will be expected 
to contribute to an inexperienced receiving corps this season. With 14 career catches, Hines is tied for second behind Deonte Thompson for the most productive active Gators receiver.
“He can be an outside receiver, and he’s big enough 
where he can block and still get out and catch the ball,” 
Brantley said. “He’s fast enough to do anything. He’s going to be a big asset for our offense.”
No QB draws: “John Brantley is not 
Tim Tebow” has become a standard re-sponse among players and coaches when 
comparing the two quarterbacks this preseason. 
But while nobody expects Brantley to carry the ball 
217 times like Tebow did last season, the quarterback said he is willing to run as much as needed this year. However, Brantley added the coaches have yet to call a designed quarterback run this summer.
Death of a “branstache”:  The fate of Brantley’s wispy 
mustache, an apparent point of contention between the quarterback and position coach Scot Loeffler, came to a head this week when Brantley shaved the facial hair. However, he said the decision was his, calling the mus-
tache “a camp thing.”Coaches not call-
