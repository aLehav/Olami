Gators hoping to run in next week’s 
Midnight Fun Run may be left standing 
still. Registration closed early for the eighth 
annual run, which is scheduled for midnight next Wednesday, due to an all-time high of 2,000 registrants. 
Even though registration was supposed 
to stay open without a cap until the day of the event, it closed midday Wednesday.
“We’ve been watching it since day one, knowing that it is unprecedented growth for us,” said Andy Howard, assistant director of marketing and communications for RecSports.
The goal was to reach 1,500 participants, 
which would beat the previous record amount of 1,300, he said. 
The run attracted more than 800 people With 2,000 registrants, Midnight Fun Run spots full

As Starbucks-fueled stu-
dents race toward ﬁ  nals and 
the semester’s end, Gainesville moving companies prepare for a marathon of their own.
Bellhops, a national tech-
based moving service, is gear-ing up for Gainesville’s annual 
post-Spring exodus with its 
largest local team yet follow-ing a successful trial period in town.
With 75 local student em-
ployees and plans to hire up to 
50 more, the Tennessee-based 
startup is expanding rapidly, co-founder Cameron Doody said.
The students — employed 
as independent contractors — receive localized mobile alerts to claim new opportunities as they become available, on a 
ﬁ  rst-come, ﬁ  rst-serve basis.
Every job is booked through 
the company’s web applica-
tion, which serves as a hub for communication prior to mov-ing day. Doody, 28, said the web-based approach allows the brand to “scale and mobilize a large workforce more efﬁ  cient-ly.”
Although Bellhops’ em-
ployment practices allow the 
company to accommodate 
high volume, the owners may be overestimating the local de-mand, said Wade Swikle, presi-dent of local competitor 2 Col-lege Brothers.
“I understand wanting to 
accommodate more business,” 
the 23-year-old UF alumnus 
said, “but it’s not like we’re turning customers away, even during peak times. I don’t think any local moving companies face that kind of demand.”
Swikle started Smarter 
Moving Solutions in 2012, dur-ing his senior year at UF. He ac-
quired 2 College Brothers from 
its founders last October.
Like Bellhops, Swikle ex-
clusively hires students for his moving service. But with six employees and the goal of hir-ing between 10 and 15 more this week, the similarities end. 
Students employed by Bell-
hops have to pass an in-depth screening and training process before they can get a job, but Swikle said there’s no substi-tute for consistent experience in the ﬁ  eld.
“Jobs run more smoothly 
with trained employees that coordinate moves on a regular 
basis,” he said. “They’ve dealt 
with different situations over time and gained the experience that comes with that.”
Although 2 College Brothers 
is retaining a traditional em-ployment structure, Swikle said he isn’t afraid to mix things up.
The company is partnering 
with Gator Domino’s this sum-mer to bring free large-pizza vouchers to every moving job this summer.
“People always order pizza 
when they’re moving,” he said, Moving companies 
ramp up for Summer

Alachua County Tax Collector 
LaVaughn Fraser died Thursday 
morning after an extended ill-
ness.
Fraser, 76, had served as the 
tax collector since 2000 after 
spending about two decades as 
the assistant tax collector.
John Power, chief deputy tax 
collector, said Fraser, who insist-
ed on being called “Von” by all 
of his colleagues, enjoyed serving 
the residents of Alachua County for the past 33 
years. 
“He loved 
people, and people loved him,” Power said. “He was 
really admired 
throughout the 
community.”
Before serving in public of-
ﬁ  ce, Fraser served a tour of duty in the U.S. Army as a non-com-missioned ofﬁ  cer, according to a news release. 
He received his degree in ac-counting from UF in 1969 and a master’s degree in public admin-
istration from the University of 
North Florida in 1992.
Power said Fraser’s main fo-
cus when working was customer service.
“(He) enjoyed serving the pub-
lic and instilled that in his staff. We miss him, but the best way we can honor him is to continue 
serving the public,” Power said. 
“He had great appeal throughout the community. You mention his name, and people would have a big smile.”  Long-serving county tax collector dies

A local pizza joint is celebrating the end of the semester with 
free slices. 
Italian Gator Pizza by the Slice will give free pizza Monday 
to the ﬁ  rst 1,000 people who come with the Gift Certiﬁ  cates and 
More app downloaded.
“They show the app, and they get the free slice,” said Joel 
Mills, owner of the restaurant, 1728 W. University Ave.
Slices will be given out between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Gift Cer-tiﬁ  cates and More can be downloaded for free through the App Store and Google Play Store. The app offers free gift certiﬁ  cates to local businesses. 
Miles was excited when Gift Certiﬁ  cates and More creator 
and UF alumnus Edward Lavagnino approached him about 
the idea. Lavanigno said Pizza by the Slice has offered certiﬁ  -cates on the app for more than a year. He said Mills wanted to 
celebrate the end of the semester and give back to students. 
“What better way than to give free food,” Lavanigno said.

The UF club paintball team hit its 
target this weekend.
The team placed 13th out of 52 
teams in the National Collegiate Paintball Association national 
championships this past weekend in 
Lakeland.
John Lowery, president of the 
club and a 22-year-old UF aerospace 
engineering senior, said the team 
held weekly practices to prepare for 
the event, and players watched You-Tube videos to help improve their individual game.
“We had a lot of new players 
come out to play in World Cup, and it didn’t go so well,” he said. “But we were practicing a lot in prepara-tion for the competition.”
Lowery said the competition was 
tough, but he was proud of how the new players held up.Brian Basnight, treasurer of the 
club and a 20-year-old UF computer 
engineering sophomore, said one of 
the biggest obstacles the team had to overcome was lack of funding.
RecSports gives some funding, 
but the team still must charge stu-dents to play. It hopes to make par-ticipating in the sport more realistic in the future.
The team is acquiring a sponsor-
ship from Empire Paintball to help players buy gear and make practices more affordable, Lowery said. 
“Everyone is on their college bud-
get, and paintball is by far the most expensive sport I’ve ever played,” Basnight said.UF paintball team places in top 20 at national championship“I go there almost every time I’m in Midtown.”

A Florida Senate bill granting in-state 
tuition to undocumented students was 
halted Thursday night, and Gainesville advocacy groups are upset.
The bill, SB1400, would have quali-
ﬁ  ed undocumented students for in-state tuition if they attended a Florida high school for four years. The House bill passed in March.
Its Senate twin was one committee 
away from a general assembly vote, which would have meant passage of the bill, when state Sen. Joe Negron an-nounced he would not add the bill to 
the agenda for the ﬁ  nal meeting of the 
Senate appropriations committee. 
“In-state tuition discounts should, in 
my view, be reserved for legal residents of Florida,” Negron told the Miami Herald.
The announcement is a blow to 
groups who had hoped for passage. 
Colleen Baublitz of Gainesville’s Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society chapter called the decision illogical and un-founded.
“We are very dismayed,” she said. 
“There was large support across state from universities and state legislatures. (The) bill looked like it would pass.”  
Joselin Padron-Rasines, a spokes-
woman for the Hispanic Students Asso-ciation, said it’s only a delay for the bill.
“It’s only going to make us ﬁ  ght for 
it harder,” she said. “Legislators are not representing their constituents. Its the leadership that is in the way. We have a majority.”
UF declined to comment.Tuition equity bill hits 
roadblock in state Senate“because their entire kitchen is 
packed up in boxes.”
For those who prefer to leave 
their belongings in Gainesville over the summer, newcomer Haul-Box offers a cheaper alternative to traditional storage options.Born out of the Gator Lab ac-
celerator program at Starter Space downtown, the startup is the brainchild of Luke McGurrin and the program’s team of project managers. 
Students can have the com-
pany’s black and yellow plastic boxes delivered to their front door. Once the boxes are filled, the company returns to collect them. The boxes are stored in HaulBox’s warehouse until students request them back.

within the first 24 hours of 
registration. 
However, soon after 
hitting 800, Howard and a few other race coordinators went over the logistics of the event and ultimately 
determined that this year it 
would not be wise to accept more than 2,000 people. 
Their concerns included 
security, the service of 
the breakfast and the 
administration of check-in procedures.
Howard said that within 
the first week, 77 percent of the registrants were first-time participants. 
“It’s exciting for us,” he 
said. “It’s one of our goals 
to always encourage people 
who haven’t been involved.”
The department plans 
to accommodate more 
participants in 2015 due to 
the increase in interest.
He said the majority of 
respondents said they heard about the race through email 
campaigns from RecSports 
or through Facebook.“Every time we sent out 
an email campaign, we had 
somewhere around 500 
people sign up,” Howard 
said.
Toward the end of 
the registration period, RecSports stopped sending 
out email campaigns, so 
those not able to sign up wouldn’t be upset. 
The organization also 
began to send out messages to inform people that the event was going to have a cap. 
“We didn’t wait until 
registration was closed to tell everybody, hoping that everyone would have a fair chance to register,” Howard 
said.
Eduardo Rizo, a 20-year-
old UF biochemistry junior, 
said he was not able to sign 
up for the run.
He said he is disappointed 
because he and his friends 
thought it would have been 
a good way to finish off the 
semester.
“We didn’t sign up in 
advance because we didn’t think it was going to fill up,” 
Rizo said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 2014

A recent study conducted by 
researchers at Northwestern Uni-
versity Feinberg School of Medi-cine revealed some troubling re-alities for young fathers.
The study, published in Pediat-
rics Digest, followed 10,253 young men ages 24 to 32 from 1994 to 2005. By the end of the time pe-riod, 33 percent of the men were fathers. Of those men, 68 percent showed an increase in depressive symptoms.
It also suggested that main factors causing depression were living with their children, living with a spouse suffering from a form of maternal depression and fathering a child with behavioral or emotional issues.
According to the study, de-
pression affects between 5 and 10 percent of fathers while postpar-tum depression and other forms of depression affect between 10 and 15 percent of mothers.  
The study also showed there 
are few – and, in some states, no – programs that provide services 
and counseling for new fathers experiencing depression.
UF sociology professor Wil-
liam Marsiglio said the increase in 
paternal depression in the past de-cade could be related to a change in what fatherhood means.
“Fathers are now increasingly 
experiencing conflicts with work and family, to the extent that some might be experiencing psycholog-ical depression,” Marsiglio said.
Marsiglio said younger fathers 
are also transitioning into adult-hood while taking on fatherhood, which may contribute to their stress levels and put them at risk 
for depression.
For UF food science and hu-
man nutrition junior DJ Staub, 
fatherhood brought on many of these emotions and experiences.
The 21-year-old became a dad 
four years ago.
Staub said he had to embrace 
adulthood before he was ready 
because he knows his daughter depends on him to succeed in 
school and in life. 
“You are responsible for the 
safety and well-being of another person, which is an incredible change when you’re living the carefree life that most young peo-
ple enjoy,” Staub said.
Although Staub is younger 
than the men in the study, he said 
more should be done to help fa-thers who suffer from depression.
“Sometimes it’s harder for men 
to be open and honest about their feelings, and programs designed to help depressed fathers could 
make a huge impact,” Staub said.

A new study showing a relationship be-
tween marijuana use and brain abnormalities 
is facing scrutiny from some Gainesville ex-perts and residents.
The study, conducted by Hans C. Breiter, 
included 20 users between the ages 18 to 25 and 20 nonusers who were matched by sex, age and other traits. The recreational users claimed to smoke an average of four days a week.
Jodi Gilman, co-author of the study and a neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hos-pital, said the results showed a range of ab-normalities in the brain of marijuana users.
“We saw greater gray matter density in 
marijuana (users) than in control participants in the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala,” she wrote in an email. “We also saw shape 
abnormalities in the left nucleus accumbens 
and right amygdala.”
Gilman said this is the first study to show 
abnormalities in young adult moderate users. She said the abnormalities were dose-depen-dent, which means the differences were more pronounced in those who reported using more marijuana.
But Julia Rae Varnes, a specialist at Ga-
torWell Health Promotion Services, said the study only shows a relationship between marijuana use and brain abnormalities, but it doesn’t show a causal relationship. 
“The study was cross-sectional and used 
participants who were self-selected marijua-na users. That means we don’t know which came first — the brain abnormalities or the marijuana use,” Varnes wrote in an email.
However, Varnes said she thinks marijua-
na use can have downsides.
“Many drugs, including legal drugs, have 
the potential to negatively affect the brain,” 
she said. “Any drug has some potential for 
negative effects period.”Daniel Gomez, a 19-year-old business 
management sophomore at Santa Fe College, said he doesn’t think smoking marijuana moderately would have a negative effect.
“I personally think marijuana could nega-
tively affect you if you smoke excessively,” 
he said. “If you smoke like three or four times 
a week, and you’re still being productive, I don’t see a problem with that.”
Gilman said the next thing to study is the 
relationship between these structural ab-normalities in the brain and functional out-comes.
“I also think it’s important to assess how 
structure effects relate to the addictive prop-
erties of cannabis for each individual,” she 
said.Locals question study about marijuana effects on brain

Tobe Terrell put a cushion on the floor, 
sat in the Lotus position and began the 
daily meeting in the meditation room. He 
started by reading a list of 15 things that 
will make your life happier if you give them up. 
This is a regular 10 a.m. meeting at the 
Gainesville Florida Hostel, better known as the Zen Hostel.
Located at 404 SE Second St. behind the 
Hippodrome State Theatre, it is the only hostel in Gainesville and was opened in 
January 2005 by Terrell.
The hostel consists of two bright-col-
ored buildings connected by a large open 
patio. Terrell said he originally wanted to open just a Zen center but added the hos-tel to make money. 
“People can get along fine without a 
hostel, but there’s a need for a Zen center where you can advance your spiritual un-
derstanding,” he said. 
The hostel offers private or dorm beds, 
shared kitchens, bathrooms and an out-
door shower. There are no televisions, but there is free Wi-Fi.One of the current residents, who calls 
himself Pirate, said he and his girlfriend were hitchhiking in Ocala when they picked up a ride to Gainesville. 
The driver took them to the hostel, and 
they’ve been staying there for the past 
three months.
“I was so grateful for it because it’s the 
best thing that’s ever happened to me,” he 
said. 
Cindy Monaco, a manager, used to live 
in the St. Francis House before walking by the hostel. Back then, she had $60 to her name, but now she helps run the house. 
“It’s the best place I’ve ever been,” she 
said.
During the meeting, the managers and 
travelers kept describing the Zen Hostel as a shared home where they live, eat and 
work together.
“This is a place where we work as a 
community so that we don’t have to be so

Darts & Laurels 
Small-scale breweries and brewpubs are continuing to 
ﬁ  ght big-business interest as Florida Senate Bill 1714 threat-ens the beer-brewing community with oppressive rules and regulations that would hinder growth and proﬁ  t. 
“For example,” the Alligator reported yesterday, “the bill 
mandates breweries sell bottles and cans to distributors. To sell to their own customers, they must buy the stock back. Most of the time, this includes a signiﬁ  cant markup in price. It also prevents brewers from opening wineries or cideries.”
In Gainesville, we cherish our small businesses and ﬂ  our-
ishing craft beer scene. So we’re tossing an exceptionally pissed-off DART to SB 1714 for promoting sketchy mob-like 
regulation of Florida breweries. 
On Monday, we were pleased to learn that the Tampa Bay 
Times, which has a handful of UF and Alligator alumni, won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for local reporting. Staff writers Will Hobson and Michael LaForgia were recognized for their cov-erage of “the county’s Homeless Recovery program, (which) revealed that the agency — created in 1989 to provide tran-sitional housing for the poor — funneled millions of public dollars to slumlords and placed families in unsafe living con-ditions,” according to the Times. 
From one (much smaller) newsroom to another, we’re 
handing off a congrats-on-No.-10 LAUREL to the Tampa 
Bay Times. 
This week, Facebook announced that it would be rolling 
out a new feature on its mobile app that would answer what we’re always asking: Where are my friends located right now at this very moment?
A location-sharing feature called “Nearby Friends” shows 
users (who have consented to use the feature and know that their location will be broadcast) where other users are hang-ing out on a map, according to the Times. So in case you like Facebook but wish it was more similar to Grindr and The Sims 3, this new feature is perfect for you. 
No. No, it’s not perfect for you. Why do you need to know 
where your friends are at all times? This app seems more like an enabler for codependent friendships and a potential self-esteem destroyer (“Why are seven of my friends at Salty Dog right now and I wasn’t invited?”) than a tool of convenience. We’re tossing a DART at Facebook for being creepy as hell. 
And ﬁ  nally, a collective LAUREL to all those little things  
that make ﬁ  nals studying and job searching more bearable: coffee, 24-hour fast-food drive-thrus and Facebook’s tempo-rary-deactivation function. 
That’s all, folks. Congratulations to all the graduating se-
niors, and as for everyone else — see you later!

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question: Should FSU have 
handled the Winston case differently?Today’s question: Do you smoke pot?Summer is coming: Don’t be dumb
A lot of people did a lot of dumb things this week.
It’s easier than ever to land yourself in the pub-
lic spotlight, what, with everybody in the world 
walking about with the entirety of the Internet in their 
pockets. And, as it seems, very few of us can handle that kind of power.
If you’ve been having a rough day, be grateful you 
didn’t pull a stunt like the one Sarah, a 14-year-old girl from Holland, did on Sunday when she tweeted at Amer-ican Airlines’ account: “hello my name’s Ibrahim and I’m from Afghanistan. I’m part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I’m gonna do something really big bye.” 
Which turned out to be a very dumb thing to do, be-
cause American Airlines was like “um, you really f***ed up” and then gave her information to the FBI. Despite Sarah’s best attempt at using the “I’m just a 14-year-old 
white girl I’m not a terrorist pls” defense, she was ar-
rested by police in Rotterdam, Netherlans. For some rea-son, more people started tweeting fake bomb threats to American Airlines, including a guy who wanted to know if he’s allowed to ﬂ  y even though his friends call him “the 
bomb.”
The difﬁ  cult week for airlines on Twitter wasn’t over 
yet, though. Some disgruntled customer sent US Airways 
a snarky complaint, and it told her to visit its customer 
relations team. But instead of a link to the page, its reply 
contained a rather lewd photo of a woman with a model airplane that had apparently crashed into her vagina. 
This spectacular public relations blunder got more at-
tention than the Pulitzer Prizes and inspired a lot of off-
color MH370 jokes. Miraculously, US Airways has said 
the employee who sent the tweet will not be getting ﬁ  red. Whether it was an unfortunate mishap or some over-worked social media strategist’s ﬁ  nal straw being had 
remains to be seen, but the airplane-related social media 
idiocy between airlines and their customers was deﬁ  nite-ly balanced.But by far the dumbest and 
most inﬂ  ammatory thing that anyone did was cause a ruckus 
at the ceremony marking the 
ﬁ  rst anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings. Some guy left a rice cooker full of confetti 
in a backpack near the site of the 
bombings, which was in poor 
taste because the actual bombs used were pressure cook-ers, ﬁ  lled with nails and explosives, hidden in backpacks. Once it was found, the backpack was “disrupted for pre-
cautionary reasons,” i.e. preemptively blown up by the 
Boston Police Department. 
The guy who put it there was found running around 
in a silly hat, yelling “Boston Strong!” and looking abso-
lutely ridiculous. He was promptly arrested and is now 
facing charges of disturbing the peace.
Sources are divided as to whether the suspect, who 
is an art student, was doing a work of performance art, being a crazy person or some combination of those two 
things.
Even though we’ve gotten along pretty well as a spe-
cies, every now and things like those come up as really 
convenient examples of how easy it is to do something 
really stupid.
Summer is coming, and everybody and their mother is 
about to let loose. Many of them will be doing so on air-
planes. Letting go is something we all deserve to do: After a long year, a break from reality is needed. And what-
ever that ends up being, just, for the love of God, keep in 
mind the potential unintended consequences of whatever you’re doing. Getting taken into custody by the FBI is up there with some of the best ways to ruin your summer.

With graduation right around the 
corner, there’s one thing every-one you come into contact with 
is dying to know: “What are your post-undergrad plans?” 
And I tend to tailor my response to 
whoever is asking.
It’s not that I don’t have a plan — but I 
don’t exactly have a plan, either. But I’m not panicking. 
I can just feel the judgment coming my 
way after that confession, but judge away, friends. 
I may not have exact post-graduation 
plans, but that doesn’t mean my growth as a functioning member of society is stunted. And you shouldn’t feel bad if you don’t have exact plans yet, either.
Let me give you the rundown on how I 
ended up at UF. In retrospect, it all seems kind of funny. 
During my senior year of high school, I 
applied to one college: The U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. When I decided it wasn’t for me, my only other options were to take time off or go to community college.  
I chose the latter because even though 
I wasn’t sure what career I wanted to pur-sue, I knew I wanted to be in school.I enrolled in Miami-Dade 
College, and I took classes ev-ery semester from August 2009 to July 2011. I dabbled in ev-erything from geology to ﬁ  lm photography, creative writing, acting and trigonometry (who did I think I was?) all while working. When I’d earned my associates degree, it was time to apply for colleges again.
I started the process the way I do most 
things: by making a list. This particular list was of colleges with journalism programs I was interested in. Originally, UF was not on it.
I’d sworn off state schools long ago, 
a high-hat move for a Hispanic girl who grew up in a single-parent home with four siblings, but Florida was my least favorite place. I hated the thought of having to stay here if I could help it. 
I decided to apply to UF because it 
was my then-boyfriend’s top choice, and I wanted to give our two-year relationship a chance (I don’t believe in long distance).
I don’t remember how much time 
passed between when I submitted my ap-plication and when I heard back, but I’d forgotten I even applied. 
My ex had accepted an of-
fer from Rutgers, and I was planning on moving to New York to be close enough to Newark to be with this guy while establishing residency to qualify for in-state tuition at an art school in the city. 
In my 19-year-old head, 
it made so much sense. My relationship was important to me, and since I’d moved away from New York during my elemen-tary school years, it’d been my dream to move back.
Then one Saturday afternoon, I checked 
an email account I’d gone a little too long without checking (a habit I’ve since cor-rected because journalism) and saw an email from UF. I’d been admitted.
That very Saturday, I was in a ﬁ  ght with 
the signiﬁ  cant other I’d been planning to move away with, and I took UF’s accep-tance letter as a sign.
I didn’t share it with anyone at the time 
because I didn’t realize it right away, but my mind was made up. 
At the end of summer, I moved from 
Miami to Gainesville into an apartment with three strangers, and two days after that, I started at UF. 
I was an hour early for my ﬁ  rst class, 
international relations in Anderson Hall, and I remember tweeting at 7:30 a.m., “This place is straight out of ‘Dead Poets Society.’”
Fast forward three years, and I’m pre-
paring to graduate. 
During my time at UF, I’ve learned 
so much. Despite any frustrations I may voice now and then, I know I’ve received some of the best journalism training in the country. 
From having taken reporting three 
times to having paid about $700 for a ﬁ  -nancial accounting class I mistakenly end-ed up enrolled in, I wouldn’t take any of it back. OK, maybe that $700. 
Regardless, to say I’ve had a blast is an 
understatement. If there’s one thing about journalism I’ll always love it’s the con-stant change, so to have a lack of set plans post-graduation isn’t an afﬂ  iction: It’s an adventure. 
After all, plans don’t always work out 
the way you imagine.

Cody Wilson is 
not your typical second-amend-
ment activist. The for-mer University of Texas law student has gained international notoriety by being the ﬁ  rst to manufacture a gun with a 3-D printer and to make public the information necessary to allow any-one with access to a 3-D printer to do the same — actions that earned him the No. 14 spot on Wired.com’s list of “The 15 Most Dangerous People in the World.” 
But Wilson is not exceptionally 
“dangerous,” at least no more dan-gerous than anyone else with a 3-D printer.
There are two primary goals mo-
tivating Wilson and his company, Defense Distributed. For one, ac-cording to Wilson, providing people with the means of producing a gun is a literal attack on the govern-ment’s monopoly on violence. And two, it is a symbolic gesture indicat-ing that the gun can never be eradi-cated from the earth. The general question underlying his project is simple: What is to be done when society’s laws and values cannot be reconciled with the norms of our be-havior?
Wilson has speciﬁ  c cultural 
norms and values in mind. This month, while speaking at the Oxford Union, Wilson said, “The language of an open society was ripe for abuse ... It was ripe for a co-option.” 
The progressive ideal can no lon-
ger be consistent when it comes to gun control. In simpler terms, the standard progressive agenda in the U.S. is ridden with con-tradictions. Do you val-ue freedom of expres-sion, freedom to create and use new technolo-gies, freedom to commu-
nicate privately? If so, it will become increasingly hard, if it is not already impossible, to defend an anti-gun or pro-gun regulation stance. The stan-dard abstract questions about guns and society are no longer relevant: Are guns good? Should they be reg-ulated? Is gun ownership a right? A different kind of question must be asked: Namely, what role will guns play in our political future?
This is a question that must be 
asked by the nonviolent left, a group to which Wilson does not belong. His Nietzschean rhetoric reveals that violence and chaos are not nec-essarily undesirable, and although in one sense printing guns is a sym-bolic gesture, the guns are meant to be used. This is the point that must be contested.
Wilson fancies himself a phi-
losopher — or, at least, a student of philosophy — and his proclivity for postmodern jargon can easily obfus-cate the indisputable political force of his actions. His philosophizing (the supposedly dangerous part) is subpar to say the least and shouldn’t be taken too seriously. However, the act of printing a 3-D gun should be taken very seriously. It stands on its own as a concrete revolutionary act and demonstration of the inadequa-cies of the prevailing neoliberal ide-ology.

Gun regulation is impotentGuest column

Speaking OutI am a huge Stephen Colbert 
fan. Just a few weeks ago, I wrote an article defending 
his satirical show, “The Colbert Report,” in light of a hasty tweet that was made through his show’s Twitter account. The hashtag #CancelColbert ﬂ  oated around Twitter, demanding the end to the eight-year nightly news show on the basis of a “racist” tweet.
Ironically, the people who backed this idea 
will get what they wanted. Just last week, Colbert was announced to take over “The Late Show with David Letterman.”
Although “The Late Show” was an inno-
vative competitor to Jay Leno when it ﬁ  rst premiered, it has become a source of awk-ward, aged humor. Letterman’s jokes are a lot like his show’s set: They appear not to have changed much since the show began in 1993.
I’ve been saying and hoping that Letterman 
would retire soon, so when he announced it last week, I was ecstatic. It was the same joy I felt with Leno’s retirement. I was excited to see what could be brought to the table that was new and innovative.
It’s not every day someone steps down 
from a gig that’s lasted more than 20 years, especially not one that was neck-and-neck with “The Tonight Show” for a very long time.
Somehow, in the midst of all of the talk 
about replacements, Colbert’s name came up multiple times. However, the idea seemed strange every single time. One would wonder why a man who has an incredible thing going for him would give it all up.
For the past nine years, “The Colbert Re-
port” has crafted something absolutely magi-cal, something many had never seen created so masterfully. It’s the perfect combination of humor and intelligence. It pushes the lim-its. It makes me think about what could be different about myself, my elected ofﬁ  cials and even my next-door neighbor. Somehow, giving that up for something as blah as “The Late Show” seems ridiculous.Colbert is just as much a part 
of “The Colbert Report” as the “Report” is part of him. He has become one with his satirical char-acter, so much that it is hard to know what he sounds like when 
he’s not pretending to be a crazy, conserva-tive news show host. This seems to be one of the biggest issues when it comes to Colbert’s “Late Show” takeover. If Colbert drops the act, there may not be much left of him.
When Colbert ﬁ  nally does take the reins 
in 2015, I am unsure whether his audience will accept him. The Comedy Central audi-ence that does follow him to CBS will likely be disappointed, as they’ll miss the tongue-in-cheek humor and his lovable-jerk attitude.
They’ll miss the edgy jokes that targeted 
conservatives, the ridiculous impromptu Daft Punk sequences and maybe even the tra-ditional segments like “Yahweh or No Way” or “Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Col-bert, D.F.A.”
CBS chose Colbert because he was already 
a popular host with many fans and follow-ers. However, for Colbert and CBS, this move seems almost like a cheap move — they’re both losing some major opportunities.
For Colbert, he’s not only giving up an in-
credible show, but he’s giving up a character that many have grown to love. For CBS, it’s missing the opportunity to put someone truly innovative in Letterman’s spot.
In a world where a guy named Jimmy is 
more likely to get a late-show gig than a per-son of color or a woman, it would be sweet to give someone other than a white guy a chance. For example, Tina Fey could deﬁ  nite-ly pull her own weight on a late show.
Hopefully it all works out for Colbert 
because he’s one of the best comedians out there. If not, Comedy Central will surely keep his 11:30 p.m. slot nice and warm, ready for him to come on back home.

As a nurse, Lauren Furgason has 
seen her fair share of cardiac arrests.
But she didn’t expect it to happen 
to her 6-year-old son. 
Todd Miller loves to play base-
ball, soccer and tennis. He spends 
his days riding his scooter and playing with his pets — two dogs, Hooper and Brody, and a cat, Lexie. He watches “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and plays Xbox Kinect when it rains. 
Now, Todd lies in a hospital bed.Last month, he collapsed at his 
after-school program at O2B Kids, 6680 W. Newberry Road. He was taken to North Florida Regional Medical Center, where he was re-suscitated and transferred to UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, Furgason said.
Furgason, 24, was at work at the 
Shands Trauma Intensive Care Unit 
when she got the call from her ﬁ  -
ance, Brian Fryburg.  
“It never crossed my mind that 
it could have been his heart,” she said.
Fryburg, 25, who had been home 
napping, arrived ﬁ  rst.
Several O2B staff members and 
the hospital chaplain greeted him.  
“When the hospital chaplain 
came over was sort of my ‘What happened to Todd?’ moment,” said Fryburg, a UF College of Veterinary Medicine graduate student.
Furgason said Todd’s biological father suffers from a heart condi-tion called restrictive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — which causes 
the walls of the heart to be rigid and 
restricts blood ﬂ  ow. Todd has been monitored his entire life by a cardi-ologist, but he never showed signs of having the condition.    
His last appointment was in Oc-
tober.“He never complained of being 
tired,” Furgason said. “He never complained about not being able to 
keep up.”
The doctors believe Todd suf-
fers from the same condition as his 
father. He has been on medication for his heart rhythm since the day he collapsed and remains in a half-conscious state.“He’ll open his eyes, but it 
doesn’t always look like he’s look-ing at you,” Furgason said. “It looks 
like he’s looking through you.”
This week, he had surgery to 
place an automatic implantable car-
dioverter deﬁ  brillator in his torso, which will shock his heart in the case of failure. 
Todd will need rehabilitation therapy for brain damage he suf-fered in the 25 minutes between when he collapsed and when his 
heart started again, Furgason said. 
His brain was deprived of oxygen, leaving him with neurological deﬁ  -cits to his motor functions.
“We’re not sure how much 
he’ll recover from those,” she said. “That’s more of a wait-and-see game that we’re still playing.”
Furgason and Fryburg have been 
sleeping at the hospital frequently while neighbors and friends watch their pets.
“I’ve gone home for maybe four 
hours total, maybe ﬁ  ve,” Fryburg said. “If Todd has a good day, I have a good day. If Todd has a bad day, I have a bad day.”
Michael Weber, 33, facility man-
ager at O2B Kids, said Todd’s col-lapse was the ﬁ  rst life-threatening situation he has dealt with in his 12-year career.
The after-school program made 
and signed a banner that hangs in Todd’s hospital room. Weber said Todd, who was about to play kick-ball when he collapsed, was always 
smiling.
“Todd is missed here,” he said.
There are two online fundrais-
ers on Rally.org and GiveForward.com to help pay for Todd’s medical bills as well as the family’s normal monthly bills, since Furgason has taken temporary leave from work. 
Furgason and Fryburg said 
they’re overwhelmed by the com-munity’s support. Fryburg said the family is staying positive.
“In the end, no matter how much 
time it takes, we’ll have Todd back,” he said.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 2014

Hitting coach Brad Weitzel tossed baseballs about 45 feet 
from home plate to a group of Gators that included Casey 
Turgeon, Justin Shafer and Richie Martin. The three players 
played through a sub-.500 season in 2013 that had Florida and 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan on the fringe of missing postseason play.
They were laughing on Thursday as they practiced bun-
ting, which made for an appropriate scene for the No. 9 Gators (24-13, 9-6 Southeastern Conference), who have turned their season around and developed a new identity. 
“[O’Sullivan] said we’re finding our identity. I think he’s 
right about that,” Martin said. “We all know who we are, 
what we need to do to win. Everyone is coming together.”
It’s one thing to use cliché after cliché, but it’s another thing 
to back it up. Florida won five of eight road games against 
Kentucky, Florida State, South Carolina and Florida Gulf 
Coast. It finds itself in line to host a regional after ranking first 
in strength of schedule and RPI.
Life’s good for the Gators, who will start freshman Logan 
Shore (3-2, 1.67) on Friday night at 7:30 and Aaron Rhodes (3-2, 2.63) on Saturday night at 7 against Georgia (21-15, 7-7-1 SEC) to begin its eight-game home stand. Florida sits a game up on No. 11 South Carolina in the division. But the race is close — UF and last-place Missouri are separated by just three games.
“Any given weekend (the standings) can be turned upside 
down again. It’s tight. I kind of figured it was going to be like this,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s probably going to come down to the last series of the year.”
When it does, Florida will be prepared when it gets tight. 
It has 10 one-run wins, good for three more than it had last season. Rhodes emerging as a long reliever and Shore provid-ing stability to the rotation has given the Gators much-needed versatility among its pitching staff. O’Sullivan has a trove of 
pitchers, right- and left-handed, who he can depend on in any 
situation.
UF’s 2.76 walks per nine innings rank 29th in the country. 
By comparison, Florida finished 2013 at 3.15. Last year, catcher Taylor Gushue struggled, but now he leads Florida in nearly 
every offensive category, including sacrifice flies with eight. 
Execution on offense and defense has been the difference.
“It’s just confidence. We go up there knowing that we’re going to get the job done, and if we don’t then the next guy 
behind us is going to get it done,” Gushue said. “We really 
didn’t have a lot of that last year, but we’ve definitely turned it around.”
Gushue, Martin, O’Sullivan and John Sternagel all used the 
word “gritty” when describing this year’s squad. They aren’t wrong.
Rhodes would be a candidate for comeback player of 
the year if there were such an award in college baseball. He pitched 18.1 innings as a side-armer who lowered his arm slot 
to compensate for a season-ending elbow injury a year before. 
He’s already doubled that mark and is second on the team with 37.2 innings pitched and has earned a spot in the rota-tion.Shore didn’t let not making the rotation on opening week-
end deter him from anchoring the staff. Now he has en-trenched himself as the Friday starter. 
At third base, Sternagel didn’t make his first start until 
March 25 against Florida State. He has started 11 of the last 
12 contests there. Sternagel would spend his Monday off days 
practicing at McKethan Stadium. As with the rest of his team, the extra work has paid off.
“I feel like we do a lot of the small things right. I noticed 
some schools maybe have trouble bunting, or moving a guy 
over and what not,” Sternagel said. 
“I feel like we do and take pride in doing the small things 
right, because we know our defense and our pitchers are out-
standing.”

The first round of the Southeastern Con-
ference tournament in Columbia, Mo., kicked 
off on Wednesday, but UF will play its first match of the tournament later today.
No. 4 Florida (19-4, 11-2 SEC), which is 
also the tournament’s fourth seed, will play fifth-seeded Texas A&M today at 6 p.m.
“We’re preparing for a pretty gruel-
ing tournament coming up,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “The SEC this year is just wickedly tough.”
This year’s tournament 
boasts five teams ranked in the top 15 nationally, including No. 3 Alabama, No. 6 Georgia, No. 8 Texas 
A&M and No. 11 Vander-
bilt. Florida is 2-2 in matches against those four teams and 9-0 against the rest of the field.
Because they earned a top-four seed, 
the Gators received a two-round bye. UF is happy with the opportunity to enter today’s match with fresh legs against a team that has already begun competition.
“We [didn’t] want to play on Thursday. 
The more you play, the more wear and tear you’ll have on your bodies,” Thornqvist said. “But Friday is going to be tough. 
“We’re playing a top-10 team probably, right off the bat.”
If Florida wins today, it will play the win-
ner of the top-seeded Alabama and No. 8 seed South Carolina matchup.
But the Gators refuse to focus on any-
thing besides today’s match. 
“I’m going to take the old cliché — one 
at a time,” Thornqvist said. “We can’t re-ally look past Friday in any way, shape or form.”

Mackenzie Caquatto, known to 
her friends, teammates and coaches 
as “Macko,” is one of 13 gymnasts on Florida’s 2014 roster. But some-times the 22-year-old feels like she’s 
the only one.
At least one day a week, Caquat-
to is practicing alone, and most days 
she gets a late start, which forces her to stay after everyone else has ﬁ  n-ished. 
“Everyone is usually ﬁ  nishing 
up by that time, so I’m usually by myself on Thursdays,” Caquatto 
said. “But I come in and try to get 
my stuff done as efﬁ  ciently and as fast as possible.
“It’s a tough schedule, but the 
coaches are really great and they’ve worked with me and they’ve al-lowed me to come in later and they stay with me. I feel like I’m treated like any other member on the team 
when I come in late.” 
Caquatto makes this sacriﬁ  ce for 
her other passion: teaching. 
“I’ve wanted to be a teacher ever 
since I was younger and I actually 
never changed my mind, which kind of scared me coming into col-lege because everyone is like, ‘I’m doing this, no I’m doing this,’ and 
they’re changing all the time,” Ca-
quatto said. 
In December, Caquatto will cross 
the stage in the arena that has been her playing ﬁ  eld for the past four years, graduating with a bachelor’s degree in elementary education. In December 2015, she will repeat the process, graduating with a master’s 
in elementary and special educa-
tion. 
Currently, Caquatto is in the 
second year of UF’s three-year Pro-Teach program. In her ﬁ  nal year of the program, Caquatto will be placed in a full-time internship in a local classroom where she will put the practical skills she learned in class to use. 
“It’s been a crazy schedule ever 
since I started this program, but even the team, they’ve been there 
for me,” Caquatto said. “Some of 
the girls will stay after if they have time and cheer for me and keep me motivated in the gym, which is re-ally awesome too because it’s not always easy working out by your-self.” 
Caquatto is already working 
with students every Tuesday at 
Williston Elementary School. When 
she and her lead teacher dismiss their fourth-grade students at 2:15 p.m. Caquatto rushes over to the O’Connell Center to catch the tail end of her team’s practice, which starts at 1:30 p.m. 
“I think her becoming a teacher is 
actually like the cutest thing ever,” 
Bridgette Caquatto said of her older 
sister. “Because she is a small little girl herself and she is crazy; she’s a kid at heart.” 
Caquatto said she didn’t tell her 
students she’s a Florida gymnast, but one day when she was not in class, a few students recognized her on a UF gymnastics team promo-
tional poster. Since then, a few of 
her students have made a point of attending her meets to cheer her on. 
“Sometimes I’m like, ‘Ah, they 
saw me in a leotard on Friday and now I’m here teaching them.’ That’s a little bit weird,” Caquatto said. “But I mean that’s just how the sport is.” 
Balancing her two passions 
hasn’t been an easy task. 
“Macko has, for the last two 
years, really carried on a very gruel-ing schedule,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “She would often come run-ning into the gym at 4 or 4:30 p.m. when the team is ﬁ  nishing up and just knowing she’s starting to warm up and train.”
Added Caquatto: “It’s hard 
when you’re tired and you’re hav-ing a rough day and you don’t have the motivation from the girls to keep you going or to push you through that practice. That’s the only time 
I’ve found it to be really, really dif-
ﬁ  cult.” 
Caquatto’s 2014 season has been 
unlike any other. She’s competed in all-around for the Gators at ﬁ  ve of 12 meets so far this season — an impressive feat considering she sprained both her ankles during her sophomore year. 
“Anybody really could have just 
said, ‘My body’s done, I just can’t do gymnastics anymore,’ and she has refused to give in and she’s re-fused to give up,” Faehn said. 
After that, Caquatto’s contribu-
tions were limited. In her junior year, she competed on bars, beam and vault but did not compete as 
an all-arounder. That same year, 
Caquatto scored a perfect 10 on un-even bars. She was the only Gator to score a 10 in 2013. Florida’s last per-fect 10 before Caquatto’s had been scored by Melanie Sinclair in 2009 — also on uneven bars. 
“It’s really cool to think that 
you’ve actually achieved perfection 
because ever since you were ﬁ  ve or 
six, when you compete, that’s what you work for,” Caquatto said. 
In her sophomore year, her ﬁ  rst 
season competing after her injuries, Caquatto competed on only bars. During her freshman year, Caquatto competed in all-around three times. But the Illinois native, who said 
she considers herself an all-around 
competitor, almost always compet-ed bars, beam and vault when she wasn’t on the all around lineup. 
When Caquatto takes to the ﬂ  oor 
with the top-seeded Gators to com-pete in tonight’s session II Semiﬁ  nal of the 2014 NCAA Championships in Birmingham, Ala., she could be saying goodbye to one of her two passions. 
But she’s not giving gymnastics 
up cold turkey. 
In the fall, Caquatto plans on vol-
unteering as a student coach, much like former Gator Marissa King has done this season. 
“Gymnastics has been a part of 
my life since I was two years old,” Caquatto said. “So I really don’t know much outside of it, or life without gymnastics.”

Graduation Day: Caquatto chases dream of repeat title, teachingUF’s seniors, who will be trying to cap-
ture their fourth SEC tournament champi-
onship in as many years, know the ins and outs of the postseason as well as any players in the nation.  All three will try to impart as much wisdom on Florida’s three freshmen as possible during their match play.
“The most important thing for [the fresh-
men] is just to be ready physically, because it’s going to be tough,” senior Sofie Oyen said. “It’s going to be three or four days in a row, hopefully, if we do well.”
Florida will be relying on its younger 
players, especially standout freshman Kourtney Keegan and sophomore Brianna Morgan, more so than in years past. 
“Our freshmen are certainly playing bet-
ter then they have all year, and Brianna is re-ally starting to hit the ball well too,” Thorn-qvist said. 
“Obviously, that helps the team a lot be-
cause then you really know what you’re go-ing to get from your seniors. They’ve given it to us for four years, so I know exactly that I can count on them.”
The seniors have yet to lose a SEC Tour-
nament match in their three years at Florida and have played consistently over the course of the season. As long as the seniors contin-ue to perform to their standards, Thornqvist said their matches could come down to how well Keegan plays.
“Kourtney has had a tendency … to try 
to hit her way out of trouble. And that’s cost her,” Thornqvist said. 
“As a player, with the talent and the pow-
er that she has, it’s really easy to try to go to that. But she’s settling down and [starting] to try to play her way out of trouble, and that’s going to be a big step for the Gators come postseason.”
Besides Keegan, Morgan must hold down 
the show court and the Gators will have to step up their doubles play if they have any hopes of advancing to the championship. 
“If all those other little pieces in the puz-
zle [are] going in the right direction,” Thorn-qvist said, “then we’re going to be tough to beat.”� SCHWARZ WENT 4 FOR 7

Taylor Schwarz is on a hot 
streak.
The sophomore first baseman, 
who had a .263 batting average 
heading into Florida’s rematch 
against Florida State on April 9, 
went 4 for 7 at the plate and logged four RBIs in UF’s last three con-tests.
“Typically, when you look at 
pull hitters, traditionally they will hit lower by average than the hit-ters who spray the ball down the field,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“Last week, I think she was a 
little more committed to hitting the ball to all fields and has really been working hard on that. I think that’s the key to all hitters: you can’t just be one-dimensional where you hit the ball. You have to spread it around.”
Schwarz attributes her recent 
success to putting in extra practice with her swing and making some minor adjustments with her stance.
“I feel like I’ve just been staying 
with my plan since the beginning of the season,” the Palm Beach Gar-
dens native said. “Obviously, you get into some slumps in the season, 
but I think just really staying posi-tive, working with coach before practice, hitting early every single day has really helped me stay fo-cused on the field.”Schwarz hopes to continue her 
success when No. 5 Florida (37-8, 8-7 Southeastern Conference) starts its three-game series against No. 21 Texas A&M (29-14, 9-9 SEC) tonight at 8 in College Station, Texas.
“The main thing is we’ve got our 
stride back,” Walton said. “We’ve got our confidence back and when you win, good things happen for you for sure.
 “We’ll be hungry again to get 
back out on the road, at a tough place to play in College Station against a team that, as of late, has really played some good softball.”
Seniors Emily Albus and Ni-
cole Morgan lead the Aggies on of-fense. 
Albus is fourth in the SEC with a 
.438 batting average, which includes a .379 clip against conference oppo-nents. Morgan holds a .723 slugging percentage — the seventh-highest mark in the conference — and has 44 RBIs on the year.
After posting a combined .349 
clip at the plate in its past three wins, UF looks to continue its suc-
cess against TAMU.
“Typically, when you get some 
hits, you get a lot of hits and when 
you get very few hits, you don’t get many hits at all because of the way things are contagiously,” Walton said. 
“I think that’s the nature of the 
game that we play. It’s not as easy to get hits as it looks sometimes.”

UF picked up its sixth commitment 
for the 2015 recruiting class Thursday af-
ternoon when Marcus Lewis, a defensive 
back out of Washington (D.C.) Gonzaga 
College High, verbally committed to Flori-da, as first reported by Rivals.com.
“IM 100 %COMMITTED TO THE UNI-
VERSITY OF FLORIDA!!!!!!!!!!!!! #Gator-Nation!!!! #FloridaFamily!!!!” Lewis post-
ed Thursday on his Twitter account (@
THE_NUMERO_UNO). 
Lewis’ high school is located in Wash-
ington D.C. — fewer than four miles away 
from defensive back and early enrollee 
Jalen Tabor’s alma mater, Friendship Col-legiate Academy. 
In an interview with Rivals.com, Lewis 
said his relationship with Tabor influenced his decision.
The  6-foot-1, 
180-pound Lewis helped Washington Gonzaga Col-lege High win 14 games 
in his last two seasons 
and is currently listed as 
the No. 8 player in the na-tion at his position. He is 
the No. 76 player in the class, according to Rivals.com
He is the second defensive back to join 
UF’s 2015 class along with Jacksonville Trinity Christian’s Deontai Williams, who committed back in January. The Gators’ 
current 2015 recruiting class also features 
three-star wide receiver Deondre Farrier, three-star offensive lineman Tyler Jordan, linebacker Camrin Knight and wide re-ceiver Tristan Payton.FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

With their last days in Gator uniforms quickly 
approaching, seniors Mike Alford and Florent 
Diep hope to meet the high expectations their teammates and coach have set for them. 
In Alford’s ﬁ  rst three years in Gainesville, he 
has gone 36-19 in tournament singles matches. Younger players like Elliot Orkin and Maxx Lip-mann go to Alford for help with issues on and off the court. 
“Mike is the All-American guy” coach Bryan 
Shelton said. “We talk about our core values, talk about passion, excellence, teamwork, com-
mitment and all the things that make special 
student-athletes. 
“And, this guy, he’s got it all. And that’s rare; 
it’s rare for a guy to bring all of them to the table, but he does. I appreciate what Mike brings to this team.”
Diep has a 49-32 record in singles the past two 
seasons. The experienced senior has led the way for his team this season.
“When I came in, we wanted to try to set the 
standard here at the University of Florida to be 
the program that is the model program for all other programs,” Shelton said. “That’s one of the 
things we are shooting for here. 
“We’re not there yet, but we’re working at it, 
and Flo is helping us get there because he sets a standard. He sets the standard for doing the little things that it takes to have real success — success that will last. Not just a week, not just a season but a lifetime.”
After a four-day 
break from competi-tion, the Gators will play in their ﬁ  rst 
match of the Southeastern Conference Tourna-ment against No. 13 seed LSU at Brownlee O. Currey Jr. Tennis Center tonight at 7.
“Our guys earned the ﬁ  rst-round byes; going 
8-4 in the SEC is not easy,” Shelton said. “One of our goals this season was to win the SEC Tour-
nament. So, for us, we’re excited to go into the 
tournament.”
Florida defeated LSU in Baton Rouge, La., 4-0 
on March 30. Diep won his match in straight sets that day, while Alford’s match went unﬁ  nished. 
“The conference is always tough” Shelton 
added, “but at the same time, we feel like we can beat anyone in the conference.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 18, 2014

When it comes to freshmen, all 
people think about are young, naïve 
and green rookies who need to learn the ropes, but that isn’t the case for Rebekah Greene and Andres Ar-
royo.
Their youth is what allows the 
two athletes on the top-ranked 
men’s and No. 2 women’s track teams to stand out. They’ll both get a chance to shine at the Gators’ ﬁ  nal home event of the season, the Tom Jones Memorial Invite on Saturday at the Percy Beard Track.
Both Greene and Arroyo have 
done what most freshmen haven’t done — compete immediately on the ﬁ  rst and second teams for the Gators during the indoor and out-door seasons. 
For Greene, being recruited out 
of her home country of New Zea-land created a different type of ex-perience. 
“I lived about ﬁ  ve hours away 
from my coach in New Zealand, so 
I didn’t see her much,” Greene said. 
“My training group was ﬁ  ve hours away as well, and I just trained by myself a lot. What I found here (UF) the biggest thing is training with people, it’s helped me a lot to train properly.”
In a similar case, Arroyo has his 
own freshman journey. 
Competing alongside senior mid-distance runner Sean Obinwa has helped Arroyo mature out of his high school habits quickly. 
“We pretty much learn every 
little thing from Sean. He teaches us the basics. We pick up all these things, so we use him to gain that knowledge,” Arroyo said. “I’m not in high school anymore; I have to fo-cus on growing instead of trying to compare myself to anybody because I’m in the learning stage again.”
Arroyo have competed at one of 
the biggest stages of their careers al-ready as just freshmen.
Greene competed in the distance 
medley relay during NCAA Indoors in Albuquerque, N.M., and Arroyo 
in the 4x800-meter relay. 
Adding to their experience, both 
freshmen phenoms competed at 
their ﬁ  rst Florida Relays. They both notched top ﬁ  nishes.
Greene, along with her team-
mates Cory McGee, Agata Strausa and Lannie Whittaker, dominated the ﬁ  eld in the distance medley relay 
with a ﬁ  rst place ﬁ  nish.In addition, Arroyo, Obinwa, 
Ryan Schnulle, and Donnie Lee Jr. 
ﬁ  nished second place in the 4x800.
The Orlando native also ﬁ  nished 
fourth in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:47.57, which was a person-al record and good for a 10th-place tie on the UF all-time list. 
What both athletes also have in 
common is their role as the opening leg for their team in their respective events.
Both runners have earned large 
roles already and look to utilize what they’ve already learned going into their second home meet of the season.
