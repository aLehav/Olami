� SIX MEETINGS HELD.  
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer 
At Monday’s Board of Trustees 
meetings, plans to request over 
$100 million in federal earmarks for research in 2009-2010 as well as plans to hike dorm rental rates 
and parking decal prices were ap-
proved by various committees of the board.
The full board, which is the 
university’s highest governing 
body, will meet today to take the final vote on the measures.
If they are passed, dorm rent 
would go up by $210 a semester 
for the fall and spring of 2009-2010, an average increase of about 
10 percent. Rent for the summer 
would stay the same to allow UF 
to be competitive in the cheap summer housing market.
Graduate and family housing 
would see increases next year 
ranging from $20 to $40 a month, or about 7 percent.
The increases are sought to 
counter spikes in utilities, rising 
employee salary and benefits costs and minimum wage increases.
They will also help UF install 
up-to-date features such as dou-
ble panel windows and wireless Internet, said Patricia Telles-Irvin, 
UF’s vice president of Student Af-
fairs, after the meeting.Earmarks, rate hikes approved by Board

Those who plan to march in the Florida March for Peace 
describe themselves as militant. Their Web site displays the sil-
houettes of soldiers, weapons cocked and helmets fastened.
But these soldiers don’t wield guns — they brandish ba-
guettes and carrots.
The groups from across the state participating in and en-
dorsing the March 28 demonstration in Melbourne, Fla., ad-here to Martin Luther King’s belief in militant nonviolence, which means a demanding and persistent push to alleviate human need.
“Like King, we believe that taking on militarism is taking 
on poverty. It’s taking on racism. It’s taking on sexism,” said Jeff Nall, Florida March for Peace Coordinator. “Essentially, we believe it’s the key to a more peaceful world and a safer 
country.”
The groups will begin at Front Street Park, where anti-war 
activists will speak, and then will continue to the Melbourne 
City Hall to hear additional speakers. The march will include members from 60 groups across the state, including Gaines-ville’s chapter of Veterans for Peace.Nall, 29, said that he and the other members of the host organization, Humanists for Peace, want President Barack Obama to stop the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The march’s purpose is twofold, Nall said.“On the one hand, yeah. We want to influence politicians,” 
he said. “But presidents have never been the engine behind STATE NEWSMarch held to

A Gainesville convenience store 
employee stopped a man from steal-
ing Sunday night by electronically locking the store doors.At 5:10 p.m. at the Kangaroo at 
1516 S. E. 4th Ave., the store clerk saw a man putting items into his black duffel bag.
When the man tried to leave the 
store, the clerk electronically locked 
the doors, the Gainesville Police De-
partment arrest report stated. After the man realized the doors 
were locked, the clerk asked him 
what was in his bag. The man pushed the clerk out of the way, went to an office in the 
back of the store and took the items out of his bag, the report stated.After he was arrested, Tommie 
Nobles, 39, said he was involved in the theft as a lookout but denied taking the items, the report stated. Nobles put five Glade air fresheners, an Amoral car interior spray, and 
a 32 oz. Natural Light beer into the 
duffel bag.According to the report, officials 
also found half a gram of mari-juana and a glass pipe containing cocaine residue in his bag.  Nobles was charged with petit theft, simple battery, possession of less than 20 
grams of marijuana and possession 
of drug paraphernalia.

Officials: Folk ballad inspiration recaptured
LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a convict and inspi-
ration for a folk ballad about a man who stole a Wal-Mart trailer 
to see his dying mother has been captured in Florida, two weeks after escaping from custody in Georgia.
The Polk County sheriff’s office says it arrested 34-year-old 
Christopher Daniel Gay on Monday in the parking lot of a Lake-land Wal-Mart in a stolen tractor-trailer. He had escaped in Ken-nesaw, Ga., on March 3, during transportation to face charges of stealing another trailer in Jan. 2007. 
He also is accused of stealing country singer Crystal Gayle’s 
tour bus.

Bar, 5847 S.W. 75th St., said he was 
waiting for someone to come and repair restaurant equipment when he heard a knock at the back door, Alachua County Sheriff’s Offices 
spokesman Art Forgey said.
Forgey said when the employee 
opened the door, he was met by a 
man with a gun.
The man forced the two em-
ployees in the restaurant to open the safe. After taking an undeter-mined amount of money, the man then attempted to tie the employ-
ees up with speaker wire.
The employee told officials 
when the man couldn’t get the 
speaker wire to hold, he individu-ally plastic wrapped their hands together, Forgey said.
He walked out the back door 
and headed west behind the Pub-lix in the shopping center where 
the restaurant is located.
The man has not yet been 
caught and is described as a black 
man between the ages of 35 and 40 years old with a medium-sized build. 
The employees told officials the 
man was bald with a scruffy beard and was wearing a blue shirt, blue 
jeans and a blue hat.

Carnivore, herbivore, but have 
you heard of localvore? 
A local Web site has challenged 
Gainesville residents to eat local 
foods for a month.
Registration for the 2nd Annual 
Eat Local Challenge is open until April 30, but some participants have already committed to eat local.
“I very much believe in buying local, and that’s been true all my life,” said Rachel Kohl, a Gainesville resident and challenge participant.
“I see these things that grow lo-
cally — they’ve been just down the street and slept in the dirt the night before. I think that’s part of what 
makes them so delicious.”
The contest kicks off May 1 and 
pushes the average eater to forage 
and gobble up only local and sea-sonal foods at home or at locally owned restaurants. The contest is designed to make 
people think about what they eat and where it comes from, said Ste-fanie Hamblen, founder and edi-
tor of Hogtown HomeGrown, a newsletter and 
Web site that 
promotes eating and buying local 
food. 
Hamblen says for food to be lo-
cal, the average distance should be within 100 miles of where you liveIn the Gainesville area, residents 
can buy local meat, seafood, dairy products and eggs. But produce such as watermelon, eggplant, squashes, heirloom tomatoes and citrus reach their peak in May.
When contestants lack the energy 
to cook, Book Lover’s Café, Ti Amo, New Deal and other restaurants will offer special menus with local fare.
The challenge ends May 31 at a 
community celebration hosted by HomeGrown. Participants can com-plete a chart available at the Home-Grown Web site to track their prog-ress. Local businesses will donate prizes like locally roasted coffee, massages, oil changes and gift cer-tificates for participants who keep track of what local foods they eat.
“Seasonal, local food tastes bet-
ter, money spent locally improves our local economy and local food travels fewer miles to your plate, reducing your carbon footprint,” Hamblen said.

When Charlene of Northwest Gainesville 
woke up Friday morning, she noticed some-thing missing from several yards in her neigh-borhood: “Vote Yes on Amendment 1” signs.                                   
“It’s frustrating,” she said. “I feel like I have 
a right to express myself.”
According to Jim Gilbert, a spokesperson 
for Citizens for Good Public Policy, a pro-Amendment 1 organization, roughly 100 “Vote Yes on Amendment 1” signs were sto-len from supporter’s yards between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. Friday.
“There appears to be a coordinated effort 
to steal our signs as quickly as we can place them,” Gilbert wrote in an e-mail. “Such theft is common during election seasons, as you probably know, but these all occurred on the same night and all over town.”
Since then, there have been multiple re-
ports of sign thefts in East Gainesville, Gilbert wrote.
Voters will decide on March 24 wheth-
er or not Amendment 1 would nullify Chapter 8 of the Gainesville Code of Ordi-nances, titled “Discrimination.” If passed, 
protections would be provided by the 
Florida Civil Rights Act at the state level.  
In effect, this would remove protected status for transgender, lesbian, gay and bisexual Gainesville residents and loosen protections for other classes.
Shelbi Day, a spokeswoman for Equality is 
Gainesville’s Business, said she does not con-done the sign thefts.
“We’re focusing all of our energy on getting 
out our message, and our signs,” Day said.
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg was un-
available for comment. Police reports filed by 
sign owners were unavailable at the time of 
publication.
Supporters in Charlene’s neighborhood 
have replaced or plan to replace their signs, Charlene said.Pro-Amendment 1 signs disappear from supporters’ yardsAroundGainesville

Mix one part city commissioner, half an Italian, a smidge of 
Georgia Bulldog, a Beastie Boy lover and a full serving of nor-
malcy, and you get Jeanna Mastrodicasa.
It is the normalcy that surprises many people, considering 
Mastrodicasa is Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs. She 
is also up for reelection as city commissioner.
“A lot of the city staff tell me that I’m so normal – that’s actu-
ally a recurring thing,” she said. “I don’t like a lot of recogni-
tion. That’s kind of the opposite of being an elected official. It all sounds really fancy, but I’m just a regular person.”
She enjoys spending time with her dog, Oliver, a mutt she 
rescued in 2004 after her terrier, Snoop Dogg, died. She likes to cook and spend time with her husband, Clay Sweger, a land planner for a small engineering firm. She loves “Harold and Ku-
mar go to White Castle” and “Bend it Like Beckham,” and keeps 
a box of Run-DMC figurines in her office.
Mastrodicasa attributed some of this normalcy to her small-
town upbringing in Pittsfield, Ma., which had a population of less than 50,000 people when she was growing up.
“The nearest mall was an hour away. There were no chain 
restaurants,” she said. “It was a big deal to go to a big chain restaurant.”
Despite its small-town feel, Mastrodicasa said her home 
population was full of different ethnicities, with heavy Italian, Polish and Irish influences. While at UGA, Mastrodicasa found a new passion in sports. 
In her seven years of schooling there, she only missed one home football game. She remains a Bulldog fan today.
“It’s a challenge being a Georgia fan in Gator country. I miss 
Athens. It is my inner happiness,” she said.
She graduated with a public relations degree in 1992 and 
stayed for three more years to earn a Juris Doctor at the law 
school. 
In 1997, Mastrodicasa moved to Gainesville 
to become an academic and pre-law advisor at UF. Two years later, she was appointed assistant dean of students and eventually be-came associate director with the UF’s honors program.
But by 1999, Mastrodicasa was looking for 
a task more involved with the community.
“I was ready for a new personal challenge. 
I was in a rut,” Mastrodicasa said.
Having been active with the Alachua County Democrats, she 
decided to run for city commissioner.
“It was one of the best things I ever did, but it was also very 
scary. Two days before the election I said to myself, ‘Is this really a good idea?’” she said. “But it got me off the couch and interact-ing with people.”
Since her election in 2006, Mastrodicasa’s “normal” could be 
synonymous with “busy,” but she loves it.
“I like coming to work every day,” Mastrodicasa said. “If 
you don’t love what you do, it’s gonna be a really long day ev-ery day.”gAinesviLLe CiTY COMMissiOnCommissioner exudes ‘normalcy’

social change. It has always been the grassroots 
— from the bottom up.”
Nall said he hopes the march will incite a cul-
tural shift away from militarism so that govern-ment money can be used for human need. 
“It’s an initiation into a differ-
ent way of looking at the world,” he said. “I think it’s going to be huge.”
According to Nall, the march is 
a bipartisan effort, including fiscal conservatives and liberals.
“What you find is simply a broad range of 
people who are appalled by the spending on 
militarism,” he said. 
Nall said that while some people think the an-
ti-war movement fizzled after the ‘60s and ‘70s, 
it is very much alive. But the Florida March for Peace will be no flower-power fest, Nall said.
“The kind, gentle suggestions of ‘give peace 
a chance’ are done with,” he said. “We are de-manding that militarism be brought to a halt and human needs are put ahead of greed.”March held in Jax

Today’s question: Should AIG pay 
out bonuses to its executives?Consumers jump the gun on firearmsBailout Buster
Obama takes hard line 
against AIG spending
Column
Monday’s question: Did you have 
a great Spring Break?
116 TOTAL VOTES66% YES34% NOPaper in Peril
In response to these depressing days of fiscal failure 
and the realization of the tenuous grip most people have on their homes and their jobs, Americans of ev-
ery stripe seem to be clinging to their guns and blogs.
According to FBI data, background checks for gun 
purchases reached a record high in November 2008. More than 1.5 million people bought guns from a dealer 
the month Barack Obama was elected president, a num-
ber surely far below the actual tally once gun shows and private party sales are factored into the equation.
While background checks for gun sales have been 
increasing steadily since 2007, the last few months have 
practically been an orgy of armed fortification. Janu-
ary and February of 2009 have each shown background check increases by more than 20 percent over the inflat-ed 2008 numbers. 
This same thing happens every time a Democrat takes 
the White House. Traditionally tougher on gun regula-tions, a Democrat assuming the top spot in our system means that the fear of anti-gun legislation increases exponentially. The difference this time is the sustained 
manner of the increase — and the run on bullets.
Most gun shops and sporting-goods stores across 
the country report a six-month to one-year waiting list 
on ammunition for popular pistols and semi-automatic 
firearms. The kicker, though, is that everybody saw this 
coming; the managers and owners of these sold-out gun shops ordered thousands of extra rounds of ammo, only to be swamped by a level of demand that few thought possible.
Demand that far outstrips supply is the wet dream of 
capitalism, and this particular bear market seems fueled entirely by Internet speculation. Obama has not been (tele)prompted to say anything about guns thus far in his first 50 days of power, but on the Web he 
is one step from King George III.
Networks formerly connected 
by fliers and infrequent meetings 
are now solidly united by mes-
sage boards and forwarded fear-
mongering e-mails. 
Given the glacial pace of our 
government, any gun prohibi-
tion — even a reworking of the lapsed ban on assault 
rifles — would take months to wind its way through 
the byzantine bureaucracy of our federal system. Why worry about factual evidence, though, when panic is right there in your inbox?
People hoarding certain types of guns and ammo 
have artificially driven up prices and created what is essentially a speculative bubble. Rumors about puting serial numbers on bullets or making ammunition that only fires for two years after it is made are only a few of 
the theories floating around the Web these days.
This may be the most sneaky and successful viral 
marketing campaign of our digital age. America already 
sits at the intersection of race, capitalism, firearms and 
fear — a little nudge is all it would take.
If not, this is “Mad Max” investing at its finest. The 
worst-case scenario will render even the most secure 
mattress savings accounts little more than a collection of worthless paper. Trading bullets for peanut butter 
seems like a fair exchange, even post apocalypse. 
Tommy Maple is an international communications 
graduate student. His column appears on Tuesdays.Kudos to President Barack Obama for standing up to 
AIG’s outlandish intentions of paying out over $100 mil-lion worth of bonuses to top executives.
Yes, that AIG.Calling upon his Secretary of Treasury on Monday, Obama 
asked Timothy F. Geithner to do whatever legally possible to block the company from handing out the bonuses – especially considering the $170 billion given to AIG since last fall.
According to a New York Times article, the government 
does not plan on taking the company to court but rather seeks to ensure that there is greater transparency with regard to how the bailout money is being allocated.
What’s most absurd is the logic behind AIG’s intentions to 
pay out the bonuses by hiding behind the fact that language in 
employees’ contracts leaves them legally obligated. 
Hmm, considering that the federal government now owns 
80 percent of the company, it seems troubling at best that AIG 
remains hell-bent on unnecessarily draining taxpayers’ money.  
The Obama administration made a shrewd move in taking a 
clear-cut stance against AIG’s actions as public perception of the president will largely be linked to how bailout money succeeds in remedying America’s current economic crisis.
To have turned a blind eye to an ever-growing blight upon 
America would have cast a shroud of doubt on Obama’s future plans that may include additional financial packages for other entities.
Hardly the recipe for success for a president merely two 
months on the job.
Tommy Maple
letters@alligator.orgToday marks another sad 
day in journalism his-tory — the closing of Se-
attle’s oldest newspaper, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
The paper’s parent com-
pany, Hearst Co., put the P-I up for sale in January and no buyer was found at the end 
of the allotted 60 days, so the 
paper will be moving to an online-only product.
According to the paper’s 
Web site, about 20 people 
will stay on as the publication 
transitions, with hundreds of other staffers being paid two weeks per year worked in a 
severance package.
The Editorial Board hates 
to see a good paper go under. Ironically enough, this time 
last year our current editor was preparing for an intern-
ship at the P-I. 
The reporters, photogra-
phers and online staff at the P-I were some of the most 
talented and driven group of journalists out there. They are 
now left to scramble for jobs in 
an ever-narrowing industry.
While we understand that Hearst had to cut its losses, giving the paper a paltry 60-day window to find a buyer 
was extremely unfair. At this 
point, selling a newspaper that is already millions of dol-
lars in debt is doomed to fail.
Seattle will surely mourn 
the loss of its oldest newspa-per and oldest business, and 
the paper’s administration is trying to remain optimistic 
that the online-only P-I will 
remain viable. 
But the truth of the mat-
ter is the loss of the print product will be a hard pill to swallow for Seattleites, who 
have enjoyed living in a two-
newspaper town for almost a century.
The Seattle Times, the 
city’s conservative-leaning paper, will now have a mo-
nopoly over the city, and the 
hard-hitting journalism fu-eled by the fierce competition 
between the two papers may 
diminish.
With two major papers 
folding in the first three months of 2009, we fear for the future of journalism.Letters to the EditorTUESDAY, MARCH 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Column over-glorifies Stewart
Matthew Christ’s column on Monday over-
glorified Jon Stewart as our nation’s court 
jester who leads a mob in finding the fallacies in claims made by financial news networks in today’s economic crisis and in ordinary news networks heading into the Iraq War. I think a criticism of Stewart is warranted today.
In 2003, a particularly popular president 
gave the country a plan that told us that war was imminent; we’d spend a lot, but it is nec-essary for us to be safe in the future. In 2009, a particularly popular president again present-ed our country with a plan to battle this bad 
economy; we’ll spend a lot, but it is necessary 
for us to be safe in the future.  Stewart got it right in not blindly following the popularity of President George W. Bush after September 11, and by asking, “is this really necessary?”
President Barack Obama is being attacked by some at CNBC who wish not to follow blindly his master plan to protect us from a faltering economy, just as Stewart did in 2003. Yet now this court jester dropped his pitch fork 
and jumped on the Obama bandwagon. I liked 
Stewart more when he questioned the popular president in seemingly unnecessary ventures. Perhaps now we should question him.

As many of you know, the 
legislature recently met in a special session to make sig-
nificant cuts to the state’s budget for 
the current fiscal year. This special 
session was called as a direct result of the economic downturn our na-tion, our state and our individual communities have all been experi-
encing. This downturn led to subse-
quent cuts to many programs, and it will definitely shape the policies we 
implement, as well as the final bud-
get we pass during the upcoming 
regular session.
It isn’t an easy task to maintain a 
balanced budget, which is mandat-ed by our constitution. When state 
revenues are dramatically down it requires either cutting funding to departments and programs or rais-ing taxes. Many of my colleagues and I felt that now was not the time to further burden Florida’s fami-lies and businesses with additional taxes. 
No single solution will be able to 
resolve the deficit we are facing this spring. 
However, by making reduc-
tions in spending and using reserve 
funds, we have been able to steer 
clear of tax hikes and also were al-lowed to avoid major reductions to 
essential programs.  
While we faced a $2.5 billion 
shortfall for this fiscal year, next 
year’s shortfall has the possibility of reaching $5 billion to $6 billion. I 
think this makes our decisions and 
our approach this year even more important.  By tightening our collec-tive belts and reducing spending in nonessential areas, we will be better prepared for future short-falls. Using tax increases 
as a Band-Aid for this year will only delay the inevitable as we move into the next fiscal year.
Many citizens have voiced their 
concerns about the cuts that have 
been made to education. As chair-
man of the Higher Education Com-mittee and a father of three sons 
who attended public schools, the 
education of our children is a top 
priority. However, with the deficit 
we face, no program or department can be held harmless, and education 
is no different. 
Considering education takes 
up over half of the budget, sparing 
education from cuts would unduly burden the departments that receive significantly less in appropriations (Health and Human Services is sec-ond with just more than 25 percent). We have worked to cut as little as 
possible and maintain funding in 
areas that are essential to our youth who are enrolled in K-12 classes. Higher education as a whole will be aided by the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act.  
The stimulus bill will provide 
additional funding for Pell Grants, work-study programs and higher 
education tax credits. While the total 
amount of money allotted for each 
program is not fully known, it will certainly be a help to those that are 
looking to further their education 
in a time of economic hardship. UF will also be helped if a bill allowing tuition increases is successful during this session. The bill, currently in committee, 
will provide additional funding to the university system and bring tu-ition closer to the national average.
Although we are facing trying 
times economically, we are working to build a more efficient and effec-tive government. Our decisions to-day, as tough as they may be, will go 
further in securing a stronger future 
for the generations that will follow. By requiring that our government 
live within its means, we can remain 
confident that the state of Florida 
and its people will return to better 
economic times.

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 17, 2009
Telles-Irvin told Trustees that 
dorms are having to compete 
with more and more apartment complexes, some of which lure 
students with creative incentives.
“They’re offering mopeds, 
they’re offering laptops, they’re 
offering, you know, free food,” 
she said.
The board could also decide 
to raise parking decal prices by 
about 10 percent next year. Under the increase, an annual student 
decal would cost $134, up from 
$122.
Tuition for first- and second-
year in-state students in the Col-
lege of Medicine’s Physician As-
sistant program could also be 
hiked 10 to 15 percent to make it 
comparable to other schools in the Southeast.
UF’s students currently pay 
about $14,000 a year, whereas 
those at Barry University, also in 
Florida, pay $42,000 a year, ac-cording to board documents.
The board’s committees also 
had a slew of discussion items, which were not up for vote, on 
their agendas at the meetings.
Topics included plans to start 
offering an online business degree 
at Santa Fe College and the demo-lition of UF’s band shell.
Beginning in the fall, Santa Fe 
students will be able to enroll in a program offering bachelor’s de-grees in business administration.
The classes will be online, ex-
cept for tests, and taught by UF 
faculty and staff.
The same degree is already of-
fered through UF at other state 
colleges, but has not been offered 
at Santa Fe because of fears it 
would draw local students away 
from UF, said Andy McCollough, senior associate dean of the War-rington College of Business Ad-
ministration.
Board members were also in-
formed at the meeting that UF’s 
Flavet Field band shell will be de-molished next week to make way for a new band shell.
Telles-Irvin said the new band 
shell should be ready by early July and will cost about $1 million. 
Half the money will come from 
the Capital Improvement Trust Fund, which is supported by stu-dent tuition fees at state universi-
ties. UF’s Activity 
& Service Fee, paid 
by UF students, will 
cover the rest.
Former UF Student Body Pres-
ident and Trustee Kevin Reilly, 
excited about the new band shell, 
jokingly asked if he could swing 
the first sledgehammer to help de-molish the old structure.
“You can go watch,” respond-
ed Carol Walker, assistant vice 
president of UF’s Facilities Plan-
ning & Construction.
Trustees were also briefed 
about UF’s new student survey, 
the Student Experience in the Re-
search University (SERU) survey, 
which was e-mailed to UF under-graduates yesterday. 
In an effort to get students to participate, UF has made comple-tion of the survey mandatory for eligibility in the football ticket lot-tery and is offering the possibility 
of $50 coupons at UF’s bookstore, 
among other prizes, for comple-
tion of the survey.
Trustees also discussed the im-
plications of the state’s most re-
cent revenue projections.
On Friday, economists pro-
jected the state’s revenues, which 
come mainly from sales taxes, will be short another $2.3 billion 
for the next fiscal year, which be-
gins July 1, and $1.1 billion for the 
current fiscal year, according to a presentation by Jane Adams, UF’s vice president of university rela-
tions.
The state’s budget deficit for 
2009-2010 could be $6 billion or 
more, according to projections.
It’s not yet clear how these pro-
jections might affect UF’s budget.
The state Legislature will use 
the estimates to determine the state’s budget by the end of its session on May 1.While state revenues are down, 
so are donations to UF. After a re-cord haul of almost $65 million in December, the UF Foundation 
raked in less than $40 million in 
January and February.
Trustees were presented with 
some good news, however. Over 
the last 12 months, UF has saved 
almost $1.4 million in printing 
costs, including such expenses as 
paper, ink and printer repair.       
Much of the savings come from 
publishing reports exclusively on-
line, said Joe Hice, UF’s associate 
vice president for Marketing and 
Public Relations.
Ed Poppell, UF’s vice presi-
dent for Business Affairs, also told 
Trustees that UF will seek to use 
$10 million originally allocated 
for a new chemistry building for energy efficient modifications at various campus buildings instead. 
The modifications, if approved, 
will likely pay for themselves in 
two to five years, he said.

POLL QUESTION TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY ON TELEVISION ONLINE� THE TEAM WILL PLAY 
TEMPLE IN ITS 1ST GAME.
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
Just imagine the feeling.
UF, 9-22 two seasons ago, is 
NCAA Tournament-bound, but 
perhaps not without feeling a little slighted.
The Gators (23-7, 9-5 South-
eastern Conference) gathered together in Ben Hill Griffin Sta-dium on Monday night and watched as they received a No. 8 seed for the Big Dance.
UF will face No. 9-seed 
Temple (21-9, 11-3 Atlantic 10 Conference) in Storrs, Conn., on Sunday.
The part that wasn’t so re-
freshing for the Gators is a po-tential second-round matchup with No. 1 overall seed Connect-icut (33-0) on the Huskies’ home court. That’s unless No. 16-seed Vermont, a team UF faced ear-lier this season, pulls off the un-thinkable.
“Do I think we’re better than 
an eight seed? Absolutely, I 
think we’re better than an eight 
seed,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “But for us to be able to say that, we need to back it up.”
Junior guard Steffi Sorensen 
felt the same way about the Gators’ path.
“We were kind of hoping for 
a better seed, but certainly you can’t go in there down about it,” Sorensen said. “We’ve just got to go in there and play our game and kind of play with a chip on our shoulder.”
Still, the feeling for UF was 
reassuring knowing what it has accomplished so quickly, going from no postseason two years ago to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament last year

From Selection Sunday to 
the finalizing of the Sweet 16, I’m in heaven. 
I always print out way too 
many brackets and start us-ing different methods — gut 
feelings, stats, coaches, mas-
cots, cool names — to get an idea of how I should fill it in (Chief Kickingstallionsims’ 
name  alone is definitely e n o u g h for me 
to pick 
Alabama State in the play-
in game).
T h a t 
keeps me busy enough that 
Thursday and Friday roll around in no time — and 
these are the best two days of 
the year.
With 32 games in two days, 
the first round is unbeatable 
entertainment. You can plant 
yourself on the couch and marvel at the steady stream of upsets and buzzer beaters pouring out of your televi-
sion. 
Forget school. And show-
ering.
And March Madness 
means the greatest sports-
caster of all time is back in the spotlight: Gus Johnson. If you don’t know who I’m talking about, I feel sorry for you.

There’s nothing like a rivalry game to 
wake up a reeling team.
UF (9-7, 0-3 Southeastern Conference) will 
host FSU (9-6) at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium 
tonight fresh off of suffering a three-game sweep at the hands of Arkansas over the weekend. 
The Gators committed eight errors over 
the three losses and continued to get no help at all from the bullpen. 
The Razorbacks were the Gators’ first 
competition from the SEC, but the Seminoles might present the toughest challenge so far.
FSU posted a 54-14 record a year ago that 
culminated in a College World Series berth. 
Though there was a lot of turnover from that squad, such as the loss of 2008 Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year and No. 5 overall MLB Draft pick Buster Posey, the Seminoles lineup is just as formidable. 
FSU sophomore Tyler 
Holt comes into today’s 
game hitting .475, and the 
dynamic leadoff man leads the team in stolen bases (five) and doubles (10).
Third baseman Stuart 
Tapley, also a sophomore, has provided the most power for FSU. He comes 
in hitting .333 with a team-high four home 
runs and 15 RBIs.
The Seminoles’ Achilles heel has been their 
pitching staff. 
Every starter in the rotation has already 
suffered a loss, and their team ERA is a ro-bust 5.40. 
By comparison, UF’s staff boasts a 3.89 
ERA, although pitching hasn’t exactly been a 
bright spot for the Gators. 
Freshman Alex Panteliodis (2-2, 6.50 ERA) 
will take the hill for the Gators tonight after 
struggling in his last outing against Arkansas 
on Saturday. Panteliodis lasted just 1 1/3 in-nings after allowing five hits and giving up 5 runs.
Freshman Brian Busch (0-1, 3.06) will get 
the start for FSU. 
FSU leads the all-time series with UF 115-
93-1, and the Seminoles took two of three from the Gators a year ago. 
UF did, however, defend its home field and 
came away with a 6-1 victory in Gainesville before dropping the other two games in Jack-sonville and Tallahassee by a combined score of 14-4.UF BASEBALLGators to renew rivalry with Seminoles

� THE NEW PORT RICHEY GULF HIGH JUNIOR IS 
UF’S 2ND LINEMAN RECRUIT IN THE 2010 CLASS.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
The latest addition to the Gators’ 2010 recruiting class is a 
big one.
New Port Richey Gulf High’s Leon Orr — all 6-foot-6, 300 
pounds of him — announced his intent to sign with UF on 
Sunday while at the Badger Sports/New Level Athletics Pass Camp in Las Vegas.
Orr is the Gators’ eighth oral commitment and second line-
man prospect for the 2010 class. UF’s other lineman commit, 
257-pound Ian Silberman, is significantly smaller than Orr.
But if Orr has his way, size will be only one of his advan-
tages.
Despite his girth, Orr is noticeably quick. He starts at defen-
sive tackle and tight end for Gulf, earning all-county honors 
at both positions. He even played fullback as a sophomore.“(Opponents) see me, they’re like, ‘He’s big, he ain’t going 
to be able to move,’” Orr said. “But then when I do it, they be so surprised that it catches them off guard.”
Orr probably surprised a lot of people when he showed up 
at a 7-on-7 camp this weekend. 
Drills there pit an offense consisting of a quarterback, a 
center and five eligible receivers against a pass defense — linebackers and defensive backs. The center usually volun-teers to snap, not be a full-time lineman, so 300-plus pounders are a rare sight.
Despite his size, Orr had no intentions of snapping during 
the drills. He wanted to hone his ball skills in preparation for next season, when he hopes to be Gulf’s best receiving op-tion.The camp featured other members of UF’s 2010 recruit-
ing class, most notably quarterback Trey Burton and safety Jonathan Dowling. Orr said he talked to Burton — whom he met at the UF-Tennessee basketball game on March 1 in Gainesville — a lot during the weekend and traded texts with Dowling.
The light-on-his-feet Orr memorizes passing routes and 
runs with players half his size. The big-as-an-ox Orr is known to lift up and slam opponents like a heavyweight wrestler.
Orr has been on UF’s radar since last summer, when he 
attended the team’s Friday Night Lights camp.
“Before then, no one really knew about me,” Orr said. “Af-
ter the Friday Night Lights (camp), that’s when I opened a lot of eyes.” 
The camp gave Orr a chance to show how well he could 
move his big body, and the coaches offered him a scholarship on the spot.
Orr will attend the Urban Meyer Elite Lineman Camp this 
June.
Oral commitments are non-binding until a national letter-of-
intent is signed on National Signing Day on Feb. 3, 2010.Large lineman prospect Orr orally commits to Gators
and now the NCAA Tournament.
“To have a chance to sit here this 
year and watch a selection show not 
wondering or hoping whether we’re in, but knowing that we’re in and be-
ing concerned about who we’re play-
ing and where we’re going to be sent, I think it speaks a lot to how far this pro-
gram has come in a very short amount 
of time,” Butler said.
The Gators’ opening game will be 
against a team they beat last year on the road by 14 points. Butler missed the meeting because of her grand-mother’s death.
Butler, a former A-10 coach at Char-
lotte, said she watched her old team beat the Owls in this year’s conference tournament semifinals on March 8. She noted that she’ll have some familiarity facing an old conference foe.
UF was one of seven SEC teams 
selected for the tournament, tying the Big East Conference for most teams selected.
Butler said that stat was a testament 
to the grind her team faced all year that has allowed it to get to this point.
“There’s no one in our league that is surprised by that,” Butler said. “It was such a unique year because there was a lot of talk about the SEC being down. And everyone in our league, we’re all looking at each other as we’re battling every Thursday and Sunday going, ‘There is not a thing that’s weak 
about anybody in this league.’ It’s the 
best league in the country.
“A lot of people feel like the Big East 
is the best league,” Butler added, “but 
that’s because the Big East has UConn.”
Speaking of the 
Huskies, Butler has no interest in looking 
ahead.
“All I’m worried 
about is Temple,” 
Butler said.
UF guard Sha Brooks, back in the 
tournament for the first time since her 
freshman year, isn’t worried about 
what could possibly be looming in the 
second round either.
“I don’t think it’s a distraction,” 
Brooks said. “I think it’s actually a mo-
tivation for us to see actually where 
we are. This is the end of the road, so if you don’t get this win against Temple then you don’t really have to worry about UConn.”UF not looking ahead to UConn
TOURNEY , from page 14
the fullest by fans whose teams aren’t part 
of it.
But there’s something about the tour-
nament that makes me sad. As most things do, March Madness got me thinking about college football. 
NCAA hoops is my third or fourth fa-
vorite sport behind NCAA football, the NFL and sometimes MLB, but for me, its finale easily tops everything else in sports.
So when I think about how awesome 
the next few bracket-busting weeks will be, I can’t help but imagine what a college football playoff would be like.
When the tournament starts, there’s no 
fear in the back of my mind that I’ll feel cheated when it’s over. The game is de-cided on the court, where the contenders can battle each other head-to-head, and I’ll always feel 100 percent comfortable 
referring to the tournament’s winner as 
the national champion.
Those characteristics are usually not a 
part of the college football season, where 
two teams are selected by computer pro-
grams from a super-exclusive club of schools to face off for the title while every-one else plays in highly publicized, totally 
meaningless bowl games.
In my mind, this is the most basic rea-
son that college football needs a play-
off. Sports are supposed to provide two things: entertainment and a champion. A 
playoff would satisfy both categories to a 
much greater degree than the current sys-tem does.
Obviously, working out the details 
(number of teams, conference privileges, money, locations) will be difficult, but the notion that a playoff is necessary should be universally accepted.
Besides, when I was driving back to 
Gainesville on Sunday, I watched as a space shuttle tore across the sky, and if we can do that, we can figure out a way for some football teams to take part in a 
playoff.
Now, when this college football play-
off comes into being, as it inevitably will, 
March Madness will have some serious competition for the title of best postseason 
tournament.
But until then, I’ll take Gus Johnson or 
a Western Kentucky-Illinois matchup over 
a college football bowl game any day.MIKE , from page 14

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JACKSONVILLE  — The Jacksonville Jag-
uars waived receiver Matt Jones on Monday, 
parting ways with the former first-round draft pick just days after his latest arrest.
Jones was jailed last week in Arkansas for 
violating a plea agreement that stemmed from a drug charge in 2008. The 6-foot-6 Jones, a for-mer star quarterback at Arkansas, is awaiting an April 13 court appearance.
After failing a drug and alcohol screening, 
Jones told a judge he drank beer while golfing with friends. He assured the judge it wouldn’t happen again.
The Jaguars didn’t want to take a chance.
“All roster moves are decisions we feel are in the best interest of the organization,” Jag-
uars general manager Gene Smith said. “This 
decision is a result of our ongoing player and 
roster evaluations. We expect responsibility and accountability, and those are important qualities as we continue the process of build-ing this team.”
Although Jones was wildly popular in Ar-
kansas, he wasn’t revered nearly as much in Jacksonville. Fans thought his laid-back atti-tude was a sign he didn’t care about football, 
and coach Jack Del Rio ripped him at times for 
his work ethic.
Many thought Jones would be released 
last year after he was charged with cocaine possession in July. But the 19th overall pick in 2005 had a strong preseason and stuck around despite the arrest. He responded with the best season of his career, catching 65 passes for 761 
yards and two touchdowns. 
His case, meanwhile, was moved to the 
drug court, where defendants submit to treat-
ment and other restrictions with the goal of keeping them from offending again. A defen-dant can wipe his record clean if the program is completed successfully.In the plea agreement reached in Octo-
ber, Jones was ordered to participate in NFL-
sponsored substance-abuse counseling and 
undergo random drug testing. The judge told him to return to Fayetteville after the season to complete the program. Jones remains in the drug court program. 
The NFL suspended Jones for the final 
three games last season for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy. Jones’ depar-ture leaves Jacksonville with huge holes at the 
receiver position. The Jaguars released Jerry 
Porter last month and opted not to re-sign free agent Reggie Williams. 
That basically leaves third-year pro Mike 
Walker and veteran Dennis Northcutt as the only receivers on the roster. nATIOnAl f OOTbAll lEA guEJaguars drop Jones after failed drug, alcohol test
� BOBBY BOWDEN COULD 
LOSE 14 CAREER WINS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — FSU will ap-
peal part of an NCAA sanction that 
would take away wins in 10 sports, 
including as many as 14 in football.
President T.K. Wetherell will 
announce the school’s appeal Tues-
day.
Trustees chairman Jim Smith 
says the board is 100 percent behind the decision. 
“It’s certainly unfair to coach 
(Bobby) Bowden,” Smith said Mon-
day. “It was a breakdown in aca-
demics, a breakdown that none of us condone.”
Earlier this month, the NCAA 
took away scholarships and put the school on four years’ probation as part of the punishment for 61 ath-letes who took a music history class where test answers were provided 
and other prohibited help was re-
ceived.
Bowden could also lose 14 wins 
from the 2006 and 2007 seasons 
when players who took the class played. More than two dozen foot-
ball players were suspended for four games after the school discov-ered the cheating.
“I feel for coach Bowden,” said 
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who earned his undergraduate degree at FSU. “I doubt that he had any knowledge what was happening 
with some of those students. I think 
it would be just, especially for coach Bowden, for that to be changed.”
Bowden has 382 wins, just one 
less than Penn State’s Joe Paterno — the all-time leader in major college coaching wins.
After learning of the cheating, 
FSU reported it to NCAA officials and began its own investigation 
to identify which athletes were in-
volved.
“I think the NCAA ought to give 
some hard thought to why would you self-report if they come back 
and you’re penalized so harshly?” 
Smith asked. “Schools should be en-couraged to self-report as we did.
“Florida State did the right 
thing,” said Smith, a lawyer who served two terms as Florida’s at-torney general. “We self-reported, stood up and were counted.”FSU to appeal NCAA sanction aimed at stripping wins“All roster moves are decisions we 
feel are in the best interest of the 
organization.”
