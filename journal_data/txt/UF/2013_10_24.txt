An ongoing study by professors at Harvey 
Mudd College in Claremont, Calif., has found 
the ﬂ  ipped classroom model may be an inef-fective practice. But UF professors are defend-ing the practice.
In a ﬂ  ipped classroom, the learning expe-
rience is swapped from the traditional style, giving students online lectures at home and real, homework-type problems during class.
The study is still in its early stages, but 
student surveys had mixed feelings about the new model, according to USA Today.
“After students solve some problems at home, it gives depth to my class,” said Meera Sitharam, UF associate professor of computer and information science and engineering. Stu-dents are able to prepare themselves at home so class time can be used working out prob-lems that need clariﬁ  cation, she said.
UF assistant professor of electrical and com-
puter engineering Gloria Kim likes the ﬂ  ipped teaching style and said it promotes active learning that gets students more engaged.

A high-proﬁ  le branding agency has opened its 
doors downtown at 21 SE Second Place with the 
goal of revamping the UF brand.
160over90, a Philadelphia-
based advertising and public relations company that serves clients including American Eagle Outﬁ  tters, Nike and Mercedes-Benz, celebrated its opening with a ceremony Wednesday morn-ing.
The company has created 
about 35 new jobs and about 
$500,000 in capital investment in Gainesville as a result of its expansion.  
Gov. Rick Scott, who spoke at the ceremony, 
said the opportunities the company has created for workers in Gainesville are invaluable.
“Jobs are people,” he said. “Someone’s life may 
be changed because of a job.”
Scott also noted that UF will beneﬁ  t from its 
partnership with the company.
“160over90 will help make sure everyone knows 
UF is a top 10 in the country,” he said.
The company made the decision about a year 
ago to move to Gainesville to focus on redesigning the UF brand to showcase its potential as a top 10 university. 
Additionally, it will better be able to serve pre-
existing Southeastern clients.
Bernie Machen, president of the university, said 
while UF originally sought out the company to change UF’s brand and market its potential as a top 10 university candidate, he thinks the entire com-munity will reap the beneﬁ  ts.
“(Company leaders) saw the buzz and were 
impressed enough to become a part of this buzz as well,” he said. “All of this bodes well for the city of Company draws

College grads seem increasingly will-
ing to relocate for employment, and lo-
cals attribute the wanderlust to technol-ogy changes and a lean job market.
The survey, conducted by Apartment 
Guide earlier this year, found that about eight in 10 students would be willing to move for a job after college. Sixty-one percent of respondents said the price of the apartment was their deciding factor in whether they would make the move.Kelli Munn, a local public relations 
ﬁ  rm owner, said she thinks some of the anxiety about moving has eased because of the rapid growth in communication through technology.
“Back when I was in school, connec-
tion was expensive. I remember writing my brother letters in college,” she said. “Now, we can FaceTime and Skype. I think probably feeling that connection makes us feel less vulnerable about mov-ing away from friends and family.”
Lizzy Stagliano, a 19-year-old Santa 
Fe College sports management sopho-more, said she plans to move after she graduates because of better opportunities elsewhere.
“Florida doesn’t have a great sports 
market compared to New York or Bos-ton, so for what I want to do, I have to move,” she said.
However, Carla Larson, a 23-year-old 
UF health and human performance alum-na, moved back to her hometown after turning her tassel. She said she wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I love where I live, and I love my 
family,” she said.

The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office arrest-
ed an Alachua man Tuesday night after depu-
ties reported he hit his granddaughter with a gun multiple times.
Edward Emery Taylor, 78, was arrested on 
charges of aggravated battery, according to an arrest report.
At about 11 p.m., a deputy responded to a 
home located at 13220 NW State Road 235 af-ter a report of a fight, according to the report.
Taylor’s granddaughter, 42-year-old Val-
erie Ann Harris, had been visiting at a house next door. She went back to the residence she shares with Taylor to use the phone and got into an argument with him, according to the report.
During the fight, she 
called Taylor names and said she had something for him. Taylor responded that he had something for her, 
too, and pulled out a load-ed handgun from under a chair.Harris tried to take the gun from him, but 
he hit her over the head with it several times, according to the report.
After the fight, Taylor told the deputy he 
figured he would rather hit her with the gun than shoot her with it, according to the report.
Deputies booked Taylor into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 5 a.m. Wednesday, where he remained in lieu of a $50,000 bond.Man, 78, hits granddaughter, 42, with loaded handgun

Gov. Rick Scott, Darryl Cilli, Shannon Slusher and UF President Bernie Machen cut 
a ribbon after the ceremony at 160over90 on Wednesday morning promoting the new headquarters in downtown Gainesville. 160over90 is an international branding agency and is creating 35 new jobs with a $500,000 capital investment.
It’ll revamp UF’s brand for top 10
Gainesville.”
Shannon Slusher, chief executive offi-
cer for 160over90, said the company chose 
Gainesville as its Southeastern headquarters because it was geographically relevant and had a “creative and technical heartbeat.”
“[Gainesville] has a cultural soul and 
unique identity with a passion for growth,” he said. “We’re super proud to call Gainesville our new home.”
Darryl Cilli, chief creative officer for the 
company, echoed Slusher’s sentiments.
He added that another reason the compa-ny decided to pick Gainesville was because it was an appealing location for employees.
“People want to work in a great college 
city. Gainesville is that city,” he said. “We’re humbled and privileged.”
John Carlson, a chair for the Council for 
Economic Outreach, also attended the event.
He said the opening represented the im-
portance of collaboration between the local and state government, UF and 160over90.
Calson said the company’s decision to 
relocate to Gainesville was more than just a smart business move.
“It was wise, logical … and Gator smart,” 
he said.BRAND , from page 1

Using an interactive U.S. map that’s 
circulating on Facebook, Time magazine 
released “America’s Mood Map,” clas-sifying regions of the U.S. by personality traits. Some Gainesville residents, howev-er, are reacting skeptically to the concept of personifying geography.
The study, published in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology, uses data from thousands of personality tests based on the Big Five Inventory model. The tests rated participants on five traits: openness, conscientiousness, extrover-sion, agreeableness and neuroticism.
Based on the collective test scores, 
Middle Atlantic and New England states had “temperamental and uninhibited” tendencies. The South and Midwest had “friendly and conventional” tendencies. The West Coast, Rocky Mountains and Sun Belt had “relaxed and creative” ten-dencies.
But Amy Panikowski, a 34-year-old 
UF geography doctoral student, said the model leaves out some aspects that can shape regional personality.
“Considering urban versus rural geog-
raphy, you will have a significant differ-ence,” she said. “The ‘mood map’ is over-generalizing regions and not accounting the spatial factors.”
Cody Starling, a 23-year-old UF his-
tory senior, disagreed with the map en-tirely. He explained stereotypes change with personal experience.
“Before I went to New York City, I 
saw people as being stuck-up and not willing to help. Things changed when I went there. They were really friendly and helped me with directions,” Starling said.
Lauren Griffin, a teaching assistant 
in UF’s sociology department, said she’s hesitant the statements are overly broad.
“Pieces like this are interesting,” she 
said. “They’re intellectual curiosities, but to make judgments about regions — I just don’t know how you could do that with only a Big Five inventory.”State map gets personalLIFESTYLE

With students cramming for 
midterms, a new app has launched 
in the United States to take the edge off studying.  
On Tuesday, eFaqt announced 
it had come out with a new ver-sion of its Web-based study appli-cation. Students with the app will be able to make flash cards, take notes and create mind maps.The new version of the app will 
automatically structure how stu-dents should study and let them know when they can take breaks.
Christiaan Henny, the founder 
of eFaqt, said most study apps have one method of studying such as flash cards, but eFaqt combines flash cards, mind mapping and re-viewing into one app.
He said he specifically wanted 
to reach out to students at UF be-cause it is applicable to the major-ity of courses that UF offers.
“It enhances your learning 
quality with super high-speed so you get the results you want,” he said.
Ellis Starkey, a 20-year-old UF 
telecommunication major, said she is excited to use the app to study for finals.
“I know that I have to get all of 
my studies done,” she said. “The idea of having an app that will help me pace my studies and help me learn will be really helpful.”
Henny, who runs the app out 
of Amsterdam, said he hired a study coach when he was having his own problems studying in col-lege.
“I was inspired by all of the re-
search on studying,” Henny said. “I thought it would be great if I could put all of the studying tech-niques I learned into one app.”
Students will be able to up-
load PowerPoint presentations, class handouts, articles and text. Researchers on the other end will then develop questions and help the students structure their stud-ies.
Although the basic eFaqt app 
is free, Pro eFaqt will cost $2.99 a month, Henry said.

Dog owners are invited to have a paws-itively good 
time while supporting a purr-fect cause at the pet-friend-
ly Halloween fest at Dogwood Park & Daycare.
Howlin’ Halloween will take place Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The event will include pet costume contests, musical performances, a doggie fortune-telling booth, a chance drawing and several food trucks. Admission is $11 a dog plus $3 per additional pet.
Earth Pets Treat Truck will also serve dog treats, in-
cluding all-natural beef and chicken entrees, ice cream, frozen yogurt and nonalcoholic beer.
A portion of the admission sales will benefit No More 
Homeless Pets: Operation PetSnip, a low-cost spay and neuter clinic. All dogs must have proof of rabies vaccina-tion and must be spayed or neutered to enter the park.
“We want to spread awareness that spaying and neu-
tering actually saves lives,” said Sandi Richmond, execu-tive director of No More Homeless Pets.
Leigh Markowitz, a 19-year-old UF English sophomore 
and president of Gators Assisting Pets, the organization sponsoring the event, said the event’s goal is to raise $2,000.
Contests include scariest costume, funniest costume, 
best pet-owner look-alike and best trick.Weekend Halloween fest to draw decked-out dogs in costumes 
Students must stay disciplined
were live, they couldn’t,” she said. “They can replay it until they fully understand and then ask questions in class.”
Even as a supporter of the model, Sitharam 
acknowledges there is improvement to be made to ensure students watch lectures.
“Without my whole class watching, I have 
no firm ground to stand on,” she said. “With-out a foundation, I cannot teach the entire class together.”
For the system to work, Sitharam said, stu-
dents must be disciplined.
“I had one student who came to me and told 
me it was too much work, and she didn’t like it at all,” she said. “I also had one kid who basi-cally took charge of his own learning, which was the idea behind this at the beginning.”
John Corring, a 26-year-old UF graduate 
student and teaching assistant for Applications of Discrete Structures, is a former student of Sitharam’s flipped theory of computing class.
“The thing I liked the most about it was that 
it encouraged us to explore it on our own,” he said. “Also, working the problems over in class was sort of like a sanity check.”
Both Sitharam and Kim plan to try the mod-
el again with minor improvements. Sitharam plans to implement quizzes while also formal-izing online peer interaction forums to encour-age students to watch the online lectures.
“I am not giving up on it by no means,” 
Sitharam said. “I think this should be tried again.”FLIp , from page 1“I was inspired by all of

The Sedoctaves are getting by with a little 
help from their friends.
Although the all-female a cappella group 
is a registered UF student organization, it 
is not funded by Student Government, said Alexa Gedigian, business manager for the Sedoctaves. 
So the group has created an online cam-
paign on indiegogo.com to fundraise a trip to Southern Jam, or SoJam, a weekend of workshops and collaboration for a cappella groups across the country.
As of press time, the Sedoctaves had reached $140 of their first goal, which is $500.
Gedigian, a 22-year-old UF public rela-
tions senior said in the past, the Sedoctaves’ executive board did not know the procedure for securing SG funding. She said they now plan to gain access to SG funds by taking the proper steps.
Until then, the group has been raising money in other ways — like on Indiegogo.
Donations will go toward funding the trip 
to North Carolina State University for SoJam next month. It will also help plan a family weekend, sell merchandise and record an album.
“We are completely funded by ourselves 
and our donors and our sponsors,” Gedigian said. “We keep surprising ourselves with the amount of things we’re able to accomplish and the little pieces of recognition we’re able to get based on our hard work.”
The group has also been attending tail-
gates before football games to perform for donations.
With the International Championships of Collegiate A Cappella in the Spring and quar-terfinals held at UF, Gedigian said the group would like to have its own set of handheld microphones and a good sound system.
Kelli White, 18, a UF music education 
freshman, said the music department is al-ways underappreciated.
She said it seems like all the money goes 
to sports, and people who aren’t musicians don’t understand what is necessary to be successful such as playing on a good piano.
“Music helps musicians escape from 
academics and the stress of the real world,” White said. “The connections you build when you’re making music together is awe-some.”

At the 39th Annual Fall Har-

Janis Slean, a festival com-

“The committees have 
worked really hard to get the townspeople and businesses involved,” she said.
The festival will run from 9

The festival will also offer

� ONE IN 10 AMERICANS 
HAVE SEARCHED ONLINE FOR LOVE.

Samantha Kurzman giggled 
as she stared at her smart-
phone, thumbing through her lengthy list of Tinder messages that ranged from the mildly awkward to the blushingly of-fensive.
“Oh, God,” the 21-year-old 
public relations senior said.
Although Kurzman said she 
downloaded the relationship app as a joke, online dating for college-educated 20-some-things has become especially common, according to a new study by the Pew Research Center. Pew’s survey found that one in 10 Americans have consulted their computer or cell phone while looking for love.
Tinder is one of the top trending tools among college students. It matches users based on location and interests listed on their Facebook pages. Com-patible profiles are presented like a slideshow. If users are mutually interested, they are allowed to message each other.
“It’s funny to see how many 
people are actually using the app,” Kurzman said.
Adriana Di Graziano, a for-
mer campus representative for the DateMySchool website and app, said the site is one of the safest and most effective networking site for students. Instead of scrolling through strangers, students can look for a study buddy or a lifelong partner, she said.
“It’s just a way to get into 
communication with other col-lege students,” said the 20-year-old public relations sopho-more.
Risks aside, both Di Gra-
ziano and Kurzman said they witnessed long-term success stories that started with virtual conversations.
“It turns out they’ve met 
really cool people,” Kurzman said.
But another issue is the pri-
vacy of personal information, UF social media specialist Bruce Floyd said. 
“Anything that you’re re-
porting on Facebook is being leveraged by this new platform to connect you to another per-son,” Floyd said. “I would read through the terms of service and be aware of exactly what you’re releasing and what their inten-tions are with that content.”
Floyd also encouraged stu-
dents to meet in public places if they choose to go on a date with other Tinder users.
“Just be careful,” he said. 
“We want all our Gators to be safe.”

The Journal of the Academy of

tion professor, said she thinks the term strict vegetarians refers to people who don’t eat any animal-based foods.
The study said each subject ate 
about 2,000 calories a day. Nonveg-etarians had the highest BMI, while strict vegetarians had the lowest, ac-cording to the study.
But Neil Rowland, UF psychology 
department chair, said just consider-ing the level of meat in a diet is not strong enough evidence to determine a relationship between eating meat and a high BMI. Exercise is another component that should be consid-ered. 
However, he said, he doesn’t think 
lowering meat intake is a bad idea to lose weight, but just cutting one food group is not enough to lose weight and maintain it.
“You really have to think about a 
lifestyle change,” he said.
Soohyoun Ahn, UF assistant pro-
fessor of food safety, said she thought the study was interesting but “a little biased and risky” because it didn’t ac-count for subjects’ exercise habits or what types of meats they ate.
Bobroff said restrictive diets often 
cut out nutrients like iron, calcium and vitamin D. She said she is con-cerned with young college students who follow these limiting diets. 
“You really have to know what 
you’re doing to put together a health-ful diet,” she said.Vegetarian diet lowers BMI“We are completely funded by 
ourselves and our donors and our 
sponsors.”

Imagine you were born the son or daughter of undocu-
mented workers.
It starts in school. You hear it from your friends, 
from the news and in textbooks — illegal immigration is ruining this great country. Illegals take jobs away from hardworking Americans who need the work. After all, they must be doing something wrong: If they really want to be here, they should just go the legal way and get their green card.
Then you go home to your parents, who work grueling 
hours for less than the already unliveable minimum wage. It doesn’t make sense. But you keep working hard so you can get a good job and make the most of the opportuni-ty given to you by your parents who risked it all so you would have a better life.
But, as a youth sin papeles — without papers — the 
American Dream can quickly become a nightmare. Even with hard work in high school, dozens of extracurriculars and exceptional grades, college can be unattainable.
Citizens living in Florida and attending UF get a pretty 
good deal. The ﬂ  agship university is one of the most af-fordable colleges, costing in-state students an estimated $6,270, according to the Student Financial Affairs website.
In ﬁ  ne print at the bottom of the page reads that out-of-
state students should add $22,278 to their tuition, almost quadrupling their tuition costs. In fact, that extra cost more than doubles their total cost of attendance.
Undocumented students, then, face a unique struggle. 
They can live in Florida nearly all their lives, just like most students at UF, but still be charged out-of-state tuition. But their predicament cannot be compared to even other out-of-state students. The ﬁ  nancial burden weighs heavy when their parents face the challenge of getting jobs offering a liveable wage.
That’s why UF needs to offer undocumented students 
in-state tuition.
If UF is committed to a diverse university, they will implement tuition equality.
Last year, a memorandum 
called Deferred Action for Child-hood Arrivals, or DACA, was passed. DACA provides protec-tion for undocumented people under the age of 31 who arrived in the U.S. before 16. Another re-quirement: pursuit or receipt of a 
high school diploma or GED. Individuals must also have a clean criminal record.
While that is only a minor protection, it’s a step in the 
right direction and represents an ideal — legalization for all. With these sorts of programs beginning, UF should lead the way in making opportunity equally accessible for all students.
Florida International University has already proven this 
tuition structure works. Because undocumented students don’t have access to federal aid like Pell Grants or other aid like Florida Bright Futures, DACA students are given partial tuition waivers that make college affordable.
The same should happen at UF, setting an example as 
the state’s ﬂ  agship university and one of the most respected universities nationwide. This precedent could ripple across the state and country and help make college attainable.
The only thing that needs to happen is for UF’s Board 
of Trustees to vote on the measure. If they approve, tuition equity will be a reality for students here. It’s that simple. It’s up to the students to make sure administration knows this is important.
Undocumented students don’t have to face this undue 
economic burden to achieve their education. It’s just an-other disadvantage imposed on them that can easily be re-moved if you speak up.
After all, they’re students, just like you.Justin Jones is a UF journalism senior. His column runs on 
Thursdays.I want to believe: 
Alien conspiracy 
theory is alive and well
Out of all the mythical creatures and monsters, aliens 
have to be the scariest. 
Vampires, werewolves and mummies are nothing 
more than folk legends, and Sasquatch and the Loch Ness 
Monster are ever-elusive. 
But aliens? There are so many unknowns, alleged governmental 
cover-ups and terrifying ﬁ  lm franchises featuring toothy, scaly-skinned beasts. It’s the stuff of nightmares.
Of course, not everyone shares this negative view of ex-
traterrestrials — we’re looking at you, Steven Spielberg. 
Earlier this year, the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure cul-
minated in ﬁ  ve days of testimonies from journalists, activ-
ists, military personnel and politicians regarding the exis-tence of extraterrestrials.
“The Citizen Hearing on Disclosure was an unprec-
edented event in terms of size, scope and the involvement of former members of the U. S. Congress,” according to cit-izenshearing.org. “With over 30 hours of testimony from 40 witnesses over ﬁ  ve days, the event was the most con-centrated body of evidence regarding the extraterrestrial subject ever presented to the press and the general public at one time.”
Of course, nothing is actually proven on the website. 
Just like all the “Do aliens exist?” programs on the Syfy net-work, the video on citizenshearing.org consists of nothing more than some grainy clips of lights in the sky, a bunch of old guys pointing their ﬁ  ngers while yelling “Open the ﬁ  les!” and a ridiculously overdramatic musical score.
But, naturally, people ate it up. Though the Citizens 
Hearing was months ago — April 29 to May 3 — ﬁ  lmmaker, activist and former MMA ﬁ  ghter Jeremy Kenyon Lockyer Corbell is currently in production of a few ﬁ  lms document-ing his interviews with journalists, historians and activists who claim extraterrestrials exist and have been in contact with Earth. His documentary “Truth Embargo” is slated to come out later this year.
Corbell told VICE, “I no longer have the luxury of disbe-
lief. Humanity is being engaged by non-humans — whether our minds can handle that fact or not is an open question. The realization that we are not alone is only the beginning. If you’d been witness to the testimony at the Citizen Hear-ing, it’s pretty compelling evidence for an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race.”
No matter the compelling evidence, the whole alien-
conspiracy scene is still too much of a fringe element to be taken seriously — hence, its coverage in VICE.
Besides, as Neil deGrasse Tyson said to Business Insider 
in July, if complex beings hypothetically did exist outside of Earth, maybe they want none of us lowly, simple hu-mans.
“You don’t walk by the worm on the street and say, 
‘Gee, I wonder what he’s thinking,’” Tyson said.

“Next year in Jerusalem.”
Jews all over the world recite those 
words at the end of Yom Kippur each 
fall and then again at the end of the Pass-
over seder each spring. Year after year after year.
As a Reform Jew, I do not believe “next 
year in Jerusalem” means buying a plane ticket to Israel. In my mind, Jerusalem, the Holy City that Jews longed to return to for millennia, is a metaphor for a better world.
Yet, Jerusalem is more than a metaphor. 
Jerusalem is a real place where real people live, and for too long that place has fallen far short of the lofty ideals it is supposed to represent.
The city, its significance, its status and 
its holy sites are at the heart of the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That conflict has so tarnished the city’s image that today, Jerusalem is not the symbol of hope we all want it to be.
Over the past few weeks, there have 
been reports that the most recent negotia-tions between the parties, painstakingly put together by Secretary of State John Kerry, have accelerated. Both sides have publicly expressed support for a two-state solution to the conflict. Still, such a solution requires difficult compromises on both sides, which few Israeli or Pales-tinian leaders have been willing to publicly endorse.
Chief among these tough 
choices is the final status of Jerusalem.
In May 2009, Israeli Prime Minister Ben-
jamin Netanyahu said, “Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people, a city reunified so as never again to be divided.”
Meanwhile, the Palestinians are just as 
adamant that Al Quds (the Arabic name for Jerusalem) be the capital of the new state of Palestine. “There will be no peace without Jerusalem, no state without Jerusalem and no security or stability without Jerusalem,” President of the Palestinian Authority Mah-moud Abbas said in June.
Nevertheless, peace in Jerusalem and the 
entire region remains possible.
With both parties laying claim to the city, 
most experts agree that a lasting peace re-quires the city to be shared. Yerushalayim — the Israeli capital — would be in West Jerusalem, while Al Quds — the Palestinian capital — would be in the East.
In many ways, and despite rhetoric to the 
contrary, Jerusalem is already a “divided” city. The Jerusalem of today is home to about 500,000 Jews, 281,000 Muslims, 15,000 Christians and 4,000 peo-ple of other groups. The neigh-borhoods of East Jerusalem, home to hundreds of thousands 
of Palestinians, came under Israeli control in 1967 (along with the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip). Today, the vast major-ity of people who live in West Jerusalem are Israelis, while almost all Palestinian resi-dents live in the East. The economic, social and cultural lives of the two districts are largely isolated from one another.
Of course, one ought not underestimate 
how wrenching it will be for both parties to accept only partial control of the city. To many, it will be devastating. The Old City of Jerusalem sits on the border of East and West Jerusalem and is home to the Western Wall, the Dome of the Rock, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and Church of the Holy Sepulchre — each among the holiest religious sites in the world. Both peoples’ histories and na-tional narratives are deeply tied to what is one of the most ancient cities on Earth.
As former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert put it, “There won’t be peace if part of Jerusalem does not become the capital of the Palestinian state.” In 2008, Olmert nego-tiated with Abbas on that principle. He was willing to agree, as Netanyahu must, that the Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jeru-salem become the capital of the new state of Palestine. In turn, Abbas knows West Jeru-salem must remain the capital of the state of Israel.
The compromise will not come without 
complications. Arrangements must be made to allow the free flow of people and goods throughout the city. And all religious groups — Jews, Muslims, Christians and even oth-ers — must be able to administer and access their holy sites in the Old City. The details will have to be ironed out, but the outlines of the solution are clear to all.
Israelis, Palestinians and Americans must 
reach out together for the solution — for the heavens — knowing that only if we do so will Jerusalem once again be that symbol of a better world in which peace and justice are the rule, not the exception.
With the clock ticking on the negotia-
tions, now is the time to make the tough choices and turn the two-state solution into reality.

Hopkins News-Letter. This column originally appeared on UWire.

“Escape from Tomorrow,” a 
psychosexual fantasy film set in 
Disney World, opens at 9 p.m. Friday at the Hippodrome.
The film presents relatable 
archetypes of American families in a familiar setting. Jim, a soft-bellied everyman, gets abruptly fired from his job at the start of the film. Rather than ruin the last day of his family’s vacation, he puts on a brave face and takes his wife and kids back into the Dis-ney fervor.
As they try to enjoy the park, 
Jim begins to have strange vi-sions. Although he tries to ignore the evil grins and hateful words that flash by him, his day at the park gets progressively surreal. As he slogs through the tedium of the day, he lecherously chases af-ter teenage girls, is seduced by a former Disney princess and finds himself at the center of a bizarre sci-fi experiment.
One of the remarkable things 
about “Escape from Tomorrow” is how well-made the film is con-sidering it was shot secretly on the grounds of Disney World and Disneyland. By carrying bare-bones equipment and rehearsing scenes in advance, director Ran-dy Moore skirted Disney’s strict control of its public image and has so far avoided legal action.
But Moore’s debut is more 
than just a gimmick that has at-tracted attention in the film in-dustry. 
Having shot the film in black 
and white, he converts the cheery theme park visit into an eerie psychological exploration. It’s unique and darkly comic, but of-ten uneven in its pacing.
There are 
several running themes in “Es-cape from To-morrow,” but none of them re-ally come to frui-
tion. 
Moore seems to be mainly 
concerned with chipping at the facade of “the happiest place on Earth.” It works some of the time. The undercurrent of sexuality invites both humor and disgust, while the themes of less-than-perfect families feel genuine.
“Escape from Tomorrow” 
feels like a personal, handmade film, with all the weird and un-comfortable moments it brings. Its negative representation of Disney’s ostensible perfection is effectively creepy and makes the film worth seeing despite the me-andering plot. 
Check it out if you enjoy the 
combo of a pseudo-David Lynch movie and Mickey Mouse.

Liz Delgado, a 30-year-old 
mother from Miami, does the Vixen 
Workout because it makes her feel sexy.
“I did it for two months in Miami 
at least twice a week,”  she said. “ I was on Instagram begging them to come to Gainesville.”
The Vixen Workout, a club-style 
dance workout that originated in Miami, made its way to Gainesville last week as part of its School of Ratchet Tour.
Having enjoyed activities like 
Zumba, I thought the Vixen Work-out would not be much differ-ent. However, it was a completely unique experience.
The girls, many sporting Vixen 
Army T-shirts, entered through the VIP section of  Simon’s and were set up in rows of five.
The workout started at about 7:15 
p.m. with a story-style introduction of some of the dance moves by Janet Jones, a former Miami Heat dancer and creator of the Vixen Workout.
It went something like this:  You’re driving around and get-
ting it, and there’s a move for that, then you get hungry, so you strike your hunger pose. 
Then, you do the milkshake and add a squat to make your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard. 
If you do this in front of your 
apartment, boys will come, she said. Then, you get a booty call, and there’s a move for that. When you wake up the next morning, and he’s gone, it’s OK because we’re strong women and we got this, and that was also a move.
The twerking, percolating and 
booty shaking started when the music came through the speakers. Some of the songs played included Lil Wayne’s “Love Me,” Beyonce’s “Crazy in Love” and Jay-Z’s “On to the Next One.”
The 60-minute girls-only work-out targets thighs, butts and calo-rie-burning, said Sophia Perlstein, the publicity assistant for the Vixen Workout School.
Jones jumped 
into a high-intensi-ty choreographed routine, letting the participants learn as they went and encouraging en-thusiasm.
After an hour of intense squats 
and leg workouts disguised as club dancing, we were all sweating and smiling.
When Jones, who now has a 
child, created this workout, it was to provide confidence and an hour of escape to women of all ages.
“I think it’s a common need for 
women to feel seen whether you’re 18 or 65,” she said. “All of a sudden, at 19, you’re supposed to decide what you want to do and who you are, and it’s a lot of pressure. With this workout, no one is judging you. It’s invigorating and empowering.”
The tour has made its way 
through Florida, leaving behind a trail of dedicated followers, and it shouldn’t be long before Vixen Workouts are popping up in clubs all over town.
“It’s such a good workout and so 
fun,” Delgado said.

tip of the weekSnack Smarter
Most people eat three hearty meals per day. If eating six smaller meals throughout the 
day is not for you, it is important to incorporate snacking into your daily three-meal diet. Now, 
don’t go making any ninja-fast moves to the Doritos bag in the vending machine. Depriving your body for longer than three to four hours without food will slow down your metabolism thus causing your body to store fat at higher rates. Incorporating snacks in between meals will increase your metabolic rate and help maintain consistent energy levels. Read these ﬁ  ve tips on how to make smarter snacking choices. Liv Langdon is a 23-year-old senior 
majoring in journalism. 
You can follow @LivLangdon on 
Instagram and read her blog at 
LivLangandProsper.wordpress.com
Five ways to snack smarter:  
1. Plan ahead: Prepare your snacks in advance. Chop up, measure 
and divide food into Ziploc bags or Tupperware to make it easier to 
grab-and-go. This will decrease your chances of making rash deci-sions at the vending machine or gas station. 
2. Eat every three to four hours: Whether it’s a snack or meal, timing 
your food intake is essential to increasing your metabolism. Starving your body causes you to store fat. 
3. Hydrate: Drink 8 ounces of water with every snack and meal to 
satiate and keep the stomach feeling full. Water is also a vital com-ponent in digestion and bowel movements, so drink up.
4. Snack slow: Learn to savor every bite. It takes your brain 20 min-
utes to realize your stomach is full, so the slower you eat, the less chance there is of overeating.  
5. Proper nutrient combo: Include more than one macronutrient in 
your snacks. Combining a protein, fat and carbohydrate with every snack will slow down the breakdown of the food, allowing the body to better digest and absorb each individual macronutrient. This will also help keep you feeling fuller longer. 3 hardboiled egg whites —

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Why is it so much weirder to hear your roommate 
masturbate than have sex?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I really want to bone this guy who is incredibly well-en-
dowed. I’d go as far as saying it’s that of a baby arm or el-
ephant trunk. There’s a catch, though. He wants a relation-ship. I really don’t want to be committed to anyone, but I’m so 
horny that I could explode at any moment. What do I do?!
Dear Friend,
Masturbating is not something to be ashamed of, but it’s kind of like 
going to the movies alone or ordering an entire pizza by yourself. Sure, you’re still having fun, but it would probably be more fun if there was another person in the mix. For some reason, doing things alone is gen-erally seen as lame, but I think being alone is just ﬁ  ne. A date night for one — pizza, movie and the extra fun stuff — that’s called Monday.Dear Friend,
Don’t try to date someone you know you’re not into — especially 
if it’s just for sex. You’ll just end up hurting his feelings and make it difﬁ  cult on yourself when you try to get rid of him. It’s better to just miss out. Boning your man-friend is kind of like having Taco Bell. It seems like a great idea when it’s past 2 a.m., but when you wake up the next morning all you’ll feel is regret. You don’t want Taco Bell or a clingy guy. � THE MOVIE ENCOURAGES 
US TO PURSUE OUR DREAMS.

My dream ended in seventh 
grade.
The warning signs popped up 
repeatedly for three or four years 
before I finally got the message at 13 years old: I was never going to play third base for the Atlanta Braves.
Reality set in when I got only one 
hit in countless at-bats during my fi-nal year playing baseball. 
Strikeout after strikeout told me it 
was time to swing at something else.
After some soul searching (read: 
growing up), I decided I loved to write. Whether I’m any good is really up to you or whoever decides to em-ploy me down the road.
The harsh but necessary lesson I 
learned nearly nine years ago is the same heart-breaking lesson Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) learns in Disney-Pixar’s “Monsters Univer-sity,” available on Blu-ray and DVD on Tuesday.
From a young age, our green, one-
eyed hero has his heart set on becom-ing a scarer. 
For those of you unfamiliar with 
this film’s predecessor — the hilari-ous and heartwarming “Monsters, Inc.” (2001) — scarers venture into the human world to scare children and harness their screams for energy to power the monster universe.
However, Mike just isn’t a very 
scary guy, and the admirable hours and energy he puts into studying and learning the ins and outs of scar-ing do not do him much good.On the other end of the spectrum 
is James P. “Sulley” Sullivan (John Goodman), a monstrous creature with no work ethic. The son of famous scarer Bill Sullivan, Sulley expects to coast through his days at Monsters University on his name alone.
Mike and Sul-
ley quickly become rivals, and their animosity boils over into a stand-off that gets them removed from the scaring major by 
Dean Hardscrabble — voiced by the ridiculously excellent Helen Mirren, who infuses the character with a chilling vibe.
Exiled from pursuing their 
dreams, Mike and Sulley set aside their differences to join Oozma Kappa — your token dork fraternity — in order to compete in the Scare Games.
Should OK (The group’s “We’re 
OK!” chant made me laugh.) win the competition, Hardscrabble would al-low the entire frat — including Mike and Sulley — to become scaring ma-jors.
What follows is a laugh-out-loud, 
family-friendly take on “Revenge of the Nerds” (1984) that includes some legitimately jarring plot develop-ments. 
Director Dan Scanlon did not give 
this film a “happily ever after” end-ing, and the choice is outstanding. Even though Mike does not get what he wants, he finds fulfillment.
It’s a tough message to tackle, es-
pecially in a film sure to be popular with children. 
When I thought of my baseball 
dream growing up, I was convinced I was the exception to the “one in a million” rule. 
So did Mike, and that’s OK.Life doesn’t always turn out the 
way we hope, but there is happiness to be found in pursuing our dreams and finding ourselves along the way — even if we don’t get there.
“Monsters University” is not as 
profound as “Up” or “Toy Story 3,” but the message hits home.
Other thoughts:
Art (Charlie Day) is the film’s • 
funniest character. Outstanding lines, even better comedic tim-ing.Pixar has one of most interest- • 
ing creative processes in film-making, and the bonus features do an excellent job of giving you an inside look. I recommend the film’s audio commentary and “Paths to Pixar: MU Edition.”

“Frockets,” or T-shirts with a faux pocket 
sewn onto the front, are saving the world 
one minutely stitched monogram and chev-ron-patterned pocket at a time.
Since February, a UF student has been 
designing customized T-shirts to raise mon-ey for a different charity each month.
“I’ve always been raised to give back 
because I’ve been blessed with so much, so it’s like I’ve always felt the need to give in some way,” said Lindsie Herring, a 21-year-old UF telecommunication junior, who first started Sweet Southern Tees as a way to help out with Dance Marathon.
Although Herring did not participate in 
the fundraiser as a dancer, she still wanted to raise money.
After seeing how popular pocket shirts 
were becoming, she decided to try making them for herself at a competitive price, giv-ing a portion of the proceeds to charity. Her-ring already knew how to sew and embroi-der, so she only needed to figure out how to market the product.
After Herring started marketing the shirts 
through Facebook, the number of orders she received grew rapidly. At first, she thought she would sell mainly to locals. However, once her product was on the Internet, she started getting orders from other states and even other countries, including Korea and Canada.
“It was at a steady pace in the begin-
ning,” she said. “But after we started doing random sales and giveaways, it really took off. People will share it and like the page to get the discount or giveaway or any other contest.”
Herring said during one promotion, the 
number of followers on Sweet Southern Tees’ Instagram account doubled. It started out with 500 followers in the morning and ended the day with more than 1,200 follow-ers.
She divides the work long-distance with 
her mother, Judith Herring, who helps with sewing and embroidering.
Although she said she had no idea exactly 
how many T-shirts they sold, she estimated it was more than 1,000.
Over the past year, Sweet Southern Tees 
raised varying amounts for a different char-ity each month.
The business has supported Autism 
Speaks, Compassion International, Ameri-can Red Cross, the Wounded Warrior Proj-ect, Give Kids The World Inc. and Stop Chil-dren’s Cancer Inc.
For October, it will focus their designs and 
donations toward breast cancer research.
Judith Herring said breast cancer is a 
cause close to her heart. She has lost one aunt to breast cancer. Another aunt and two of her cousins survived breast cancer after undergoing double mastectomies.
“It’s been very much in our history, and 
I could well have it one day, too, or so could Lindsie,” Judith Herring said. “With it being in our family like that, it’s a special cause for us.”
Lindsie Herring said she knows the trend 
of pocket shirts may not last forever, so she is always looking into the future to see what other products they can sell. She plans to launch a website for the company soon.
“It makes me feel good that I’m not just 
selling stuff and making a profit for my-self, but I’m able to help other people,” she said. “I think it makes other people feel bet-ter about buying it, too. They can feel good about not only getting a shirt but helping other people, too.”

Koalas are an iconic part of Austra-
lian culture, but a new study reveals 
that the country’s lack of koala protec-tion may result in a dramatic loss of the population.  
The University of Sydney recently 
published a study concerned with a massive loss of koalas in Australia due to climate change.
“The study led by Dr. Matthew 
Crowther seems quite sound, honing in on specific risks to koalas such as heat stress and dehydration,” said Karen Kainer, associate professor of tropical forestry at UF.

koalas’ main hideout from rising tem-peratures, isn’t enough to save them from extreme climate change, according to the study.
Crowther and his team followed 40 
koalas, but a quarter died after a mas-sive heat wave in 2009, according to the study.
The outcome of his research showed the koalas would use eucalyptus trees as a food source during the night and would seek shadier trees, like belah and kurrajong varieties, during the day.
The Australian Koala Foundation has 
called for the federal government to take action by listing the koala as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. 
The foundation also aims to create a 
true protection for the koala habitat.
The act, drafted in 1999, is the Austra-
lian government’s main environmental law, according to the Australian govern-ment’s website.  
“Humans have a right to basic neces-
sities, like food and shelter,” said Aline Yonezawa, a 20-year-old UF biomedical engineering senior. “Animals should have the same right.”
Deforestation has stirred a fear for 
these furry creatures due to the lack of trees the koalas have to protect them-selves from intense heat. 
Timber contractors are permitting the 
massive destruction of trees that results in a lack of food and shade, in addition to the injuring and deaths of koalas.
“There could be more people who 
address the consequences of things like deforestation,” Yonezawa said. “We need to raise awareness.”Koala bears hurt by heat� HIS IMPRESSIVE WORDPLAY SHINES 
THROUGH HIS LATEST SINGLE.

Guess who’s back, back again?
Shady is back, and he is dominating the 
hip-hop world 14 years after he released “My Name Is.”
Controversy-inspiring rapper Eminem 
released the third single from his upcoming album, “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” on Oct. 14, and the track has drawn rave reviews. The track is appropriately named “Rap God.”
Unlike the album’s first single, “Berzerk,” 
which features heavy instrumentation that sam-ples Billy Squier and is inspired by the Beastie Boys, “Rap God” relies solely on Eminem’s rapping ability over a repeated beat. The focus is clearly on Eminem’s wordplay, which is im-pressive enough to make poets reconsider their career choices.
He begins his first verse with how he’s been 
dominating the rap game since the Clinton ad-ministration — as if we needed reminding — and proceeds to make a rather crude remark about a particular Clinton White House intern. It is clear within the first minute of the song that the real Slim Shady is back, cracking jokes at pop culture’s expense.
In the second verse, Eminem puts himself 
in line with fellow “rap gods” such as N.W.A. and Tupac Shakur, saying they taught him, and now, he is leading a new generation of rap-pers.
But don’t think that just because he claims 
to be a new rap god, he’s going to take it easy on other members of the industry. In the third verse, Eminem ridicules rappers Fabolous and Ray J for the feud they had, but the joke is over-shadowed by the most stunning part of the track, which follows soon after.
With the intro, “Lyrics 
coming at you at supersonic speed,” Eminem launches into a 15-second free-for-all in which he raps about 100 words — nearly seven words a second.
If anything could prove 
that Eminem is a “superhuman,” it would be this verse. It’s nearly impossible to process the words that quickly, let alone try to emulate him. But naturally, it would not be an Eminem song if it did not elicit a controversy.The rapper says several homophobic slurs throughout the song, which has caused some critics to condemn the song.
Eminem is no stranger to being labeled a 
homophobe — it was a common criticism early in his career. He has yet to make a statement about the lyrics to “Rap God.”
Eminem’s new track channels the essence of 
what made him the most popular rapper of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Eminem returned to the rap scene with 2009’s “Relapse,” but the upcoming “The Marshall Mathers LP 2” — due out Nov. 5 — marks the return of Slim Shady. Real Slim Shady stands back up“It was at a steady pace in the 
beginning. But after we started 
doing random sales and giveaways, 
it really took off. People will share 
it and like the page to get the 
discount or giveaway or any other

Your time until Halloween is dwindling. All 
those elaborate costumes you dreamt up in class 
are now seeming less and less possible. There are still a few simple costumes you can pull together to avoid recycling last year’s ensemble.
Wednesday AddamsThis one is super simple. A black button-down 
shirt and black skirt are likely already in your closet or one of your friends’. Throw them on, braid your hair, and you are good to go. If you are heading out to Midtown or downtown, this costume is practical and comfortable. You won’t have to deal with any pesky accessories that you’d lose any way.
Rosie the RiveterSince denim shirts are in style 
this season, you probably already have what you need for this cos-tume, too. A jean shirt and a ban-dana with any shorts will have you looking like the poster wom-
an of World War II. Show off those muscles you’ve been working on at boot camp. Wear red lipstick to dress up this look for your nighttime adven-tures. Also, be sure to do the signature Rosie pose, and flex for all your photos.
Olivia PopeWear the white hat this year, but don’t prom-
ise your friends you will be able to fix everything all night. When small drama occurs, fix it. For ex-ample, if someone spills their drink, grab a bunch of napkins, tell them you are there to clean up the mess, and proceed to clean up. Wear a stylish business suit you swore you wouldn’t wear again until the next Career Day. Wear a white hat from the party store, and you are a gladiator in a suit.
Billy Ray Cyrus circa 1990For all the  fellas with long hair, this one’s for 
you. Pull your hair back into a ponytail, and rock an unbuttoned plaid shirt and some chains. Jeans and some comfy footwear will have you ready to sing “Achy Breaky Heart” all night. Or you can do a duet with Miley. Make sure she keeps that foam finger to herself.
Brawny ManIf your hair isn’t long enough to rock a faux 
mullet ‘do but you really want to wear plaid, go as the Brawny Man. Same outfit as Billy Ray minus the chains. Don’t shave for a few days before the Halloween festivities begin. This is a fresh take on the average, last-minute cowboy outfit. Being the Brawny Man will trick people into thinking you’re creative.
Walter WhiteI’m thinking this is going to be a common cos-
tume this year. All you need are your tighty-whi-ties and a button-down shirt. Grab a pair of read-ing glasses from the dollar store and get ready to tell people not to cross you. If you’re a fan of the show, you’ll know all the right quotes to use. And, like my mom always says, make sure your under-wear is clean.Last-minute 
costumes have lasting impact

Tom Odell is a 22-year-old up-and-coming singer-
songwriter from Britain who fits the stereotype of the 
pained, sensitive, broken-hearted male whose emotions are so heavy they can only be processed alone, hunched over his instrument.
He wears oversized layered shirts, sweaters and jer-
sey jackets (even though he doesn’t play sports), skinny jeans and boots. 
He could easily fit into Gainesville’s downtown hip-
ster scene, especially at Maude’s Classic Cafe, at its out-door courtyard one balmy evening. 
I can see him singing under the strings of lights — his 
soothing ballads the perfect backdrop to a good book and a hot cup of tea.
Odell’s debut album, “Long Way Down,” which was 
released June 24, is defined by its romantic and melan-cholic lyrics accompanied by the piano, which once in a while break out into rousing Mumford & Sons-type an-thems (sans banjos and beards).
Like Taylor Swift, Odell takes an autobiographical ap-
proach to songwriting. 
“Another Love” is a song on his new album about 
how “all (his) tears have been used up” on a girl he fell in love with when he was 16 or 17, and she broke his heart, he told the Daily Mail. Apparently, his inability to have a lasting relationship at 22 is because of a romance he had sometime as a teenager he can’t remember.
Or maybe it is because he needs new material. “My last relationship, I was thinking, ‘I’ve got to end 
this or I’ll never write anything,’” Odell told The Daily Mail. “I think I subconsciously put myself in these situa-tions where the girlfriend isn’t pleased with me. I’m use-less as a boyfriend. That’s how I managed to write all these songs.” 
Woe is Odell. Somehow I fail to sympathize with his 
tragic, self-indulgent attitude toward women.Odell’s angsty, introspective style of music can also 
make relationships kind of awkward, he told Glamour magazine, when his friends know whom he is singing about.
“Well, the worst thing is that a couple of people 
think that ‘Another Love’ is about them,” he told Glam-our magazine. “It’s weird, people do say, ‘Is that about 
me?’”
Yet, I doubt the young artist is too 
concerned, seeing how he put a picture of his ex-girlfriend on the cover of his EP, “Songs from Another Love,” in Oc-tober 2012. 
But as with Swift, audiences can re-
late to the general emotions behind Odell’s personal lyr-ics, and as a result, he has shot to popularity.
In February, he received the 2013 BRIT Critic’s Choice 
Award, which has previously been given to artistic suc-cesses like Emeli Sande, Ellie Goulding, Florence Welch and Adele. 
Daily Mail said some are calling him a one-man Cold-
play. However, just weeks after the win, a critic at the music weekly NME gave Long Way Down a zero-star review, referring to Odell as a “poor misguided wan-nabe.”
But NME’s scathing review is a little misguided be-
cause aren’t all individuals wannabes? 
We are not born with predetermined identities. Rath-
er, we mold our identities based on our personalities, our inspirations and our likes, as much as our dislikes. 
And Odell’s niche works for him. He may be market-
ing to it, but there’s a demand for his brand of music.
He has shaggy, chin-length dirty blond hair, pale skin, 
quintessential crooked British teeth and fine bones. 
He wears fragile and damaged just as smartly as he 
does that Burberry jacket.
I think Odell will probably continue to rise before he 
falls, and then he will have a long way down. Odell plays up emotional, heart broken 
rocker status to award-winning successmusic14, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2013

Regina George of “Mean Girls” loves Hal-
loween, and so do makeup artists — but for a 
decidedly classier reason.
Public interest in makeup 
art seems to spike in late Oc-tober as Halloween celebrants scavenge for transformative tricks. Prepared with screen captures of Instagram pictures and YouTube videos, curious people tiptoe up to makeup 
counters — some more distressed than others.
Looking to create realistically gory zombie 
costumes, some people can overestimate what it takes to make gashes, exposed muscles and anything else that looks fresh-out-”The Hostel.” Without latex, acrylic paints and prosthetics, they act like recreating zombie makeup is off the table.
But, from a professional perspective, believe 
me: You, too, can become a Living Dead Girl fit to star in one of Rob Zombie’s films, and you need not buy retail-priced special-effects prod-ucts. You might not have to buy anything.
Simple Halloween makeup is easier to ac-
complish than a typical beauty routine (i.e., wear your dark circles with pride), and it doesn’t re-quire many more supplies than the contents of your makeup bag: red nail polish and lipgloss, foundation, powder, bruise-colored matte eye-shadows, tissues and, most importantly, false-eyelash adhesive. Duo false-lash adhesive is latex-based and can be used for more than fas-tening falsies. 
Used as described in the graphic, some of 
your makeup mainstays are a convenient alter-native to the industry-level products in some of my favorite Halloween YouTube videos. Petri-lude (@jitsyplaven on Instagram) has a useful series of Halloween tutorials that are zombie -specific. Some advice Petrilude gives that you should follow: Don’t apply the lash adhesive/tissue combination to any surface where it might adhere to hair, and moisturize the skin prior to applying.Try scarily cheap makeup tips  
Apply a thin layer of lash adhesive to the 
area where you want to create texture.
Pull a tissue apart (each tissue is actually 
two thinner tissues attached), and lay one 
ply over the area where you want to create texture. Apply a little glue to the top of the ply, and distribute it evenly with a toothpick, emery board, etc. Repeat as needed until the patch is about the thickness of a scab. Let it dry.
Once dry, glaze your foundation over the 
entire patch and set with powder. This is one of the few situations where I recommend using disposable sponges and powder puffs to apply your product.
Deposit matte black or dark purple eye 
shadow to the center of the patch, and blend it outward into reds and grays. It can be difficult to acquire red eye shadow, so instead, use a blush as your red source. The center should be the darkest part of the patch.Now, rip open the center of the patch and 
pull the tear in whatever way is needed to create the shape of wound, lesion, etc., you want.
Dab red nail polish onto the frayed tissue. 
Add some black nail polish to the tips of the frayed pieces for a grizzly, charred look. Be warned that nail polish can sometimes irritate the skin, so be sure to test a small area of your skin beforehand.
Apply a generous amount of red gloss to 
the exposed skin in the ripped center of the patch.
Duo Adhesive is sold in a water-soluble 
formula and a waterproof formula: It isn’t necessary to use the waterproof version for this look, and doing so may be more trouble than it’s worth. Be sure that you don’t use Duo if you have a latex allergy.Easy Facial WoundsBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Florida offensive lineman Tyler Moore (73) attempts to block Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam (52), who leads the nation with nine sacks and 13 tackles for a loss, during the Gators’ 36-17 loss against the Tigers on Saturday at Faurot Field in Columbia, Mo. The UF offensive line surrendered six sacks to Missouri.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Since arriving at Florida, coach 
Will Muschamp has strived to es-
tablish a power-running offense that can dominate the line of scrimmage. 
Now halfway through his 
third season with the Gators, both the offensive and defensive lines have struggled to maintain that identity.
Against Missouri on Saturday, 
the Gators (4-3, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) allowed the Tigers to gash them for 205 yards on the ground. 
While the defensive line strug-
gled, Florida could not get any protection on offense, allowing Mizzou to sack quarterback Tyler Murphy six times.
“First year, we were a little, 
you know, handcuffed, as far as where we were and what we were trying to do,” Muschamp said. “But certainly this year, I felt like that we would have played a little better at this point.”
Florida shook up its starting 
offensive line in Columbia, Mo. Sophomore D.J. Humphries, who started UF’s ﬁ  rst six games at left tackle, sat out the opening drive. Instead, Muschamp played red-shirt junior Max Garcia on the outside. Garcia had spent most of the season at left guard. 
In Garcia’s place on Saturday was redshirt senior Kyle Koehne, who has been praised for his abil-ity to play multiple positions on the line.
But on Wednesday, Mus-
champ emphasized the need to nail down the starters on the line.
“We need to settle on a ﬁ  ve 
and let those guys play,” he said. “Right now.”
Muschamp said he expects 
Humphries to be among those ﬁ  ve players, but another tackle’s job may be in danger.
Redshirt sophomore Tyler 
Moore struggled against Mis-souri’s pass rush on Saturday — especially when he was matched up against defensive end Michael Sam.
Muschamp said he would try 
to get Trenton Brown some reps. Brown, a 6-foot-8, 361-pound lineman who transferred from Georgia Military College, has been listed as the second-string right tackle since the start of the season. 
Muschamp said freshman 
Octavius Jackson may also get a chance to see some action on the ﬁ  eld.
“We’re better than what we 
put on the ﬁ  eld the last two weeks,” Muschamp said.
But while the offensive line is 
underperforming, the defensive Florida struggling to win line of scrimmage on both sides of ball

The list of season-ending injuries 
continues to grow for the Gators.
Linebacker Jeremi Powell, a key 
player on special teams, will miss the 
remainder of the season after suffering a torn ACL during Florida’s 36-17 loss to Missouri last Saturday.
Powell, a freshman, sustained the 
non-contact injury when he planted his leg and got caught in the turf during a punt-block attempt.
“So unfortunate for him,” coach Will 
Muschamp said of Powell, who had four tackles in seven games this year. 
“He’s a guy who was really emerg-
ing, special teams-wise.”
Powell is the fourth Gators player to 
suffer a torn ACL and the eighth to suf-fer a season-ending injury this year.
He joins receiver Andre Debose 
(torn ACL), linebacker Matt Rolin (torn ACL), offensive tackle Chaz Green (torn labrum), cornerback Nick Washington (shoulder), quarterback Jeff Driskel (broken leg), defensive tackle Domi-nique Easley (torn ACL) and running back Matt Jones (torn meniscus).
“It’s just one of those years,” Mus-
champ said. “It’s unfortunate, and it’s part of the game. You’ve got to coach through it and you’ve got to play through it. 
“We don’t make any excuses around 
here.”
The Gators, though, are optimistic 
about the progress of another injured Powell. Another Gator out for year

Last night, I watched a World Series game for the ﬁ  rst time this century.
alligatorSports editor and Boston 
Red Sox fan Phillip Heilman convinced 
me to overcome my annual baseball bitter-ness. His offer to buy the ﬁ  rst round of beer helped.
But before last night, I hadn’t watched a 
World Series game since 1999.
Fourteen years ago, the New York Yan-
kees crushed the dreams of an eight-year-old boy in Valdosta, Ga., by sweeping the Atlanta Braves in four straight games.
Since then, the Braves have not returned 
to the Fall Classic. Until they do, watching it just hurts. It’s torture.
Sure, I’d see highlights of the game on 
ESPN the next morning or come across up-dates on Facebook and Twitter while games were going on, but I always tried to shut it out.
Watching just re-
opened the wounds I suffered back when the Braves were 
bounced. 
(Damn it, Fredi! Just release the Kim-
brel!)
If only Tom Glavine hadn’t laid two eggs 
in his ﬁ  nal two postseason starts with At-lanta in the 2002 NLDS against the San Fran-cisco Giants. If only we hadn’t lost Chipper Columnist cannot stand sight 
of postseason without Braves

Quotable
“Anybody with a shred of intelligence can see the situation.” 
Will Muschamp
UF coach on Florida’s two-game losing streak
Jones, Martin Prado and Billy Wagner to 
injury in the rematch seven years later.
If only we didn’t run into the monster 
pitching duos of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2001 and Kerry Wood and Mark Prior in 2003.
If only Bobby Cox wasn’t baseball’s ver-
sion of Peyton Manning. Each guy was con-sistently great, but only won one title.
If only the Braves weren’t the first vic-
tims of Carlos Beltran’s postseason awe-someness in 2004.
Watching the rounds following Atlan-
ta’s elimination was especially maddening when the team that ousted my beloved Bra-vos won the National League pennant.
Since I was first introduced to Major 
League Baseball in 1999, the teams that beat the Braves thankfully only reached the World Series in 2001, 2005 and 2010. I still haven’t forgiven those Diamondbacks, As-tros and Giants teams.
Had I been around for the disappoint-ments in the 1990s, I don’t know what I would have done to cope. Kirby Puckett and Jack Morris haunt my dreams.
(Also, I have burnt John Wetteland and 
Jim Leyritz effigies.)
So forgive my anger when I see Luis 
Gonzalez’s hit game-winning bloop single against Mariano Rivera replayed every year. When the Steve Bartman incident occurred, I viewed it as the Cubs simply getting what they deserved for ruining my October.
Roger Clemens got busted for perfor-
mance-enhancing drugs? Too little too late, MLB.
This is my favorite game, and the Braves 
are my favorite team. If I sat here and told you what I’d trade for Atlanta to win an-other World Series, you would lose respect for me.
I guess I’m finally ready to move on and 
respond to Atlanta’s postseason failures in a mature manner. But if the Red Sox or the Cardinals bring in their closer for a two-inning save with elimination on the line, I swear…
Muschamp expects redshirt junior line-
backer Ronald Powell (ankle), who missed 
the Missouri game, to return to practice next week after the bye week and play against Georgia on Nov. 2. 
“He’s been unable to do anything thus 
far this week,” Muschamp said. “He’s been running, but just not ready for the change of direction and taking on blocks. But I think he’ll be fine.”
After sitting out last weekend’s game 
with a head injury he suffered against LSU on Oct. 12, defensive tackle Damien Jacobs is also expected to face the Bulldogs.
“Right now, I would say yes,” Muschamp 
said. “But I felt like he was going to play last 
week. I really didn’t know until Thurs-
day practice he was not going to be able to 
go.”
Redshirt junior quarterback Tyler Mur-
phy played against Mizzou with an injured shoulder but will not throw in practice this week. 
Tight end Colin Thompson (foot), who 
has missed the past four games, is still not ready to return to practice.  
Senior linebacker Darrin Kitchens missed 
Saturday’s game with a shoulder injury, but the team has yet to evaluate him. 
Kitchens is spending time with his fam-
ily, as his wife gave birth to a girl Monday night. 
Tale of the Taylor: After freshman run-
ning back Kelvin Taylor racked up 53 rush-ing yards on five carries and scored a touch-down that cut Mizzou’s lead to one score late in the third quarter Saturday, the Gators shied away from the run on their next drive. 
The result was three incomplete passes 
from Murphy and a three-and-out. 
Following his impressive drive, Taylor 
saw only one more carry. 
Muschamp regrets not giving more 
touches to Taylor, who had the hot hand, in the fourth quarter. 
“It became a two-score game in the fourth 
quarter and we felt like we needed to pick up the tempo of the game a little bit as far as creating some plays,” Muschamp said. “We probably got away from that a little early. We did.”
In Pease he trusts: The Gators are 106th 
out of 125 FBS teams in total offense and 103rd in scoring offense with 21.1 points per game — a year after finishing 104th and 78th in those respective categories. 
But when asked about Brent Pease on 
Wednesday, Muschamp gave the second-year offensive coordinator a vote of confi-dence.
 “Yeah, this is the same staff that came 
a game away from playing for a national championship, OK,” Muschamp said. “So obviously, we’re not where we want to be right now, and nobody knows that more than our staff.”
line is trying to just stay healthy.
Muschamp said on the SEC

ence that the defense had only 13 healthy players last weekend. Line-backer Ronald Powell (ankle) and defensive lineman Damien Jacobs (head) missed Saturday’s game af-ter suffering injuries against LSU on Oct. 12.
“We’ve got a couple of bumps 
and bruises, but nothing that’s seri-ous,” Muschamp said. 
He said he expects both Powell 
and Jacobs to return to practice in the next week.
The defense has been ailing since 
losing starting defensive tackle Do-minique Easley, surrendering an average of 164 rushing yards in its last three games.
Despite Florida’s struggles stop-
ping the ground game, the Gators still rank 12th in the nation in rush defense — a testament to their ear-ly-season dominance.
After LSU ran for 175 yards 
against UF — the most by any team to that point — defensive coordina-tor D.J. Durkin said the key to the loss was the Tigers’ ability to phys-ically dominate the Gators near the line. That problem reared its head three days later in Missouri.
“It was one of those things that 
kind of trickled down,” Durkin said on Oct. 16. 
“We weren’t winning at the line 
of scrimmage.” THURSDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 19
