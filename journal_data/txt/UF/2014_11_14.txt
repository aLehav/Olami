This year’s Florida-South Carolina game 
was supposed to be one of the marquee games 
within the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division — and it was thought by many to be the deciding factor for which team would rep-
resent the East in Atlanta for the SEC Champi-
onship. 
But the 2014 season hasn’t gone quite as ex-
pected for either of these two teams. 
We’ll start with Florida, who many specu-
lated would be able to compete for the East title thanks to veteran quarterback Jeff Driskel being utilized in offensive coordinator Kurt Roper’s new spread scheme. 
However, by the time October came and 
went, Florida was sitting with three SEC loss-es, complete ineptitude on offense and was seemingly out of the SEC East race. The third loss came against Missouri — a 42-13 blowout loss in front of a Homecoming crowd in the Swamp. 
“The last time we were out there we got em-
barrassed,” linebacker Antonio Morrison said, 
“and we don’t want to give that to our fans so 
we want to just go out there and play a great game for our fans.”
Following the Missouri loss, Florida coach 
Will Muschamp looked to be a dead man walk-ing. Names of head coaching candidates across the country began being tossed around as to who would replace him next season. 
But what a difference three weeks time can 
make. 
First came an upset victory over the then-
No. 11 Georgia Bulldogs in Jacksonville, high-lighted by a 418 rushing performance by the Florida offense. 
That output was the most rushing yards for 
a Florida offense during an SEC game since the 1975 season, and it was the second-highest rushing total given up in Georgia program his-
tory. New starting quarterback Treon Harris at-
tempted just six passes total in the game. 
Heading into the Vanderbilt game from last 
week, Florida was expected to be able to ground and pound the Commodores in a similar fash-ion it did against the Bulldogs the week prior. 
But the Florida offense showcased some-
thing that they haven’t truly found on this side of the ball all season — balance. 
“Really balance gets down to scoring more 
points than the opponent,” Roper said. “So you get into a game and you say alright how we gonna win this football game and it’s a fluid situation and it can change based on score and what’s taking place.”
While it’s true the Gators did outscore Van-
derbilt in a 34-10 win last Saturday, the of-fense had complete balance in the rushing and 
passing attack. They rushed for 214 yards and 
passed for another 215. 
Harris was very competent under center, 
completing 61.9 percent of his passes, and he also found receivers Quinton Dunbar and Ahmad Fulwood with long balls of 60 and 48 yards, respectively. Not to mention he rushed for 49 yards and two touchdowns and didn’t turn the ball over once. 
Harris’ confidence is something that both 
the players and coaching staff have said as something that is impressive because he is a true freshman — a true freshman who stepped on campus for the first time in late June.
“I think he enjoys playing so much that he 
doesn’t feel maybe the outside pressures or things like that,” Roper said. “That’s kind of the way I see it. It’s really interesting. I think he’s a 
guy that obviously understands the role, but I think he just goes and plays and doesn’t let the 
other things influence him.” 
Florida’s offense has the definite advantage 
matching up with South Carolina’s defense this week. 
To say that the unit has struggled through-
out the season would be putting it lightly when you point out that the Gamecocks rank outside the top 100 — out of 125 FBS teams — in total, 
rushing, red zone and scoring defense in the 
country. All of those categories except for red zone defense are bad enough to put them last in the SEC, too.
Despite the poor performances throughout 
the season from South Carolina’s defense, Rop-er said that there are still things he sees on film that can create problems.
“You see a team that was much more mul-
tiple from the Auburn game to the Tennessee game, much more… giving you more problems and front recognition and those type of things, you see an aggressive secondary,” Roper said. “You see a team that’s not afraid to press you.”
■   ■   ■
For South Carolina, its offense is one of 
the most explosive in the SEC, averaging 35.9 points per game. 
The offense is led by fifth-year quarterback 
Dylan Thompson, who already has more than 2,000 passing yards on the year. Thompson ranks 17th in the country in passing yards, with Texas A&M’s Kenny Hill as the only other SEC quarterback ranked inside the top 20 
Thompson is currently averaging 287.6 
yards in the air per game, but he has thrown 10 interceptions on the year. 
Thompson has a pair of lethal wide receivers 
as targets as well in Pharoh Cooper and Nick Jones. Cooper has 786 receiving yards along with eight touchdowns, and Jones is averaging 12.9 yards per reception. 
The Gamecocks, unlike the Gators, have 
been balanced on offense all season. 
Running backs Mike Davis — once a time 
a Florida commit — and Brandon Wilds have combined for more than 1,200 yards on the ground and have taken the pressure off of 
Thompson a little bit to run the offense. 
“South Carolina’s got the best offense we’ve 
faced this year,” Muschamp said Wednesday. 
“They’re balanced, Dylan Thompson is playing at an extremely high level, which doesn’t shock you with what coach has done with his quarter-backs in the past. They have stable of running backs, Mike Davis, Brandon Wilds, those guys have been there forever.”
However, this has the potential to be one 
of the toughest defenses the Gamecocks have faced all season, in fact South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier hinted at this earlier in the week.
“Their defense is really good. Probably the 
best defense we have seen all year,” Spurrier said.
Florida’s rush defense has been stout for the 
majority of the season and ranks 14th in the en-tire country. 
But the secondary allows more than 200 
yards in the air per game. 
If Cooper and Jones can cause communica-
tion breakdowns within the secondary, it could be a long day for the Gators defense. 
Much like Florida, South Carolina’s season 
has gone much differently than expected. Be-
fore the season began, various media outlets 
predicted the Gamecocks to win the SEC East title and even put them in as dark horse nation-al title candidates. 
They beat Georgia in Week 3 of the season, 
but after a victory over Vanderbilt they lost all four of their remaining SEC games including Missouri, Kentucky, Auburn and Tennessee. Those were all close games however, being 
decided by just seven points or less. With a 4-5 
record, Carolina is risking missing out on bowl eligibility after winning 11 games each of the previous three seasons. 
“We’ve had a lot of fourth quarter losses 
where we have given up some leads,” Spurrier said. “But we win as a team and we lose as a team. Anytime you lose close ones it’s frustrat-ing for coaches.”
While Spurrier and company may be fight-
ing for a bowl berth, Florida’s game is a must-win to keep their SEC East hopes alive. 
■   ■   ■
For Florida to stay in it in the SEC East, No. 
9 Auburn has to beat No. 15 Georgia in Ath-ens on Saturday, and Missouri has to lose two of their remaining three games — one of those having to be to Tennessee. Mizzou faces No. 24 
Texas A&M, who just upset Auburn last week, 
in College Station this Saturday.  
But putting SEC East hopes aside, Saturday 
for the Gators is about making up for the last time Gator Nation saw them in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium — the 42-13 embarrassing Homecom-ing shellacking against Missouri last month. They get a chance to do so by beating one of their most hated rivals inside the SEC East. 
“I really challenged our football team after 
the Vanderbilt win about how important it is to take back the Swamp,” Muschamp said, “and that’s what we need to do this coming Satur-day.”

Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn 
When parents look for role 
models in the world of athletics, 
it’s easy to point out the stars that 
make the big plays, earn the big 
bucks and win the big games.
Neither Jeff Driskel nor Mi-
chael McNeely qualiﬁ  es as a “star 
player” by any stretch of the 
imagination. Nonetheless, those two embody the team-ﬁ  rst atti-tude better than most.
It’s a demeanor that is lost to 
many of today’s athletes, but it’s one that is as valuable as ever.
A team player doesn’t care if 
he starts. 
A team player doesn’t care if 
he plays. 
A team player doesn’t leave 
Nashville hours before playing in a key Southeastern Conference 
matchup.
Leon Orr is not a team player.
I understand that Orr has 
NFL aspirations and that starting 
games is an important factor for 
NFL scouts. 
But do you know what’s more 
important to the pros?
Showing that you can main-
tain a commitment with a profes-
sional attitude.
If any NFL squad can’t trust 
you to sit quietly and patiently while you’re on the bench, then 
you’re never going to see the ﬁ  eld.
Jeff Driskel showed extreme 
poise and grace when Treon Har-
ris took his starting quarterback 
job. 
Even in a backup role, Driskel 
is doing and saying all the right 
things.“At the end of the 
day it’s a team sport 
and everybody has to contribute and do their part,” Driskel 
said. 
“If mine’s the 
backup and not get-
ting any plays at all, I want to be ready in case Treon 
goes down. If it’s being in a Wild-
cat type role, I want to be ready and able to run the ball and un-derstand the blocking schemes and the defense we’re 
going to get.”
That’s something 
you’d never hear 
from Orr.
He may say he 
loves his teammates and the University of Florida, but Orr 
didn’t show it when he aban-
doned the Gators on gameday.
Getting benched in favor of 
a true freshman must have been 
gut wrenching, but Driskel didn’t storm off in a temper tantrum. In 
fact, when Will Muschamp ﬁ  rst 
put Harris in over Driskel during the Tennessee game, Driskel still made himself available to the me-
dia afterward.
Driskel got off the team bus af-
ter that contest to talk about how 
his replacement (a true freshman) won the game for Florida.
Orr got on a bus because he 
couldn’t even put up with a ju-nior taking his starting spot.
However, in his letter to the Gainesville Sun, Leon Orr refut-
ed the notion that he is not a team 
player.
“I could have made a better 
decision, but to say that I quit on 
my team is a lie,” Orr said. “Per-
sonally, I feel like the coach quit on me.”
Leon, your coach didn’t quit 
on you when he decided to start 
Jon Bullard over you. 
He benched you. 
It’s what happens to athletes 
when they don’t perform up to 
their standard.
I can’t even take the rest of 
the letter seriously when he 
can’t even admit he quit. When you say, “Start me or I’m going 
home,” that’s quitting.
If I’m an NFL executive, I don’t 
want any piece of Leon Orr after 
he pulled that stunt.
I would want the guy that can 
stand in there and take hit after hit from the media and still have the professionalism to stand be-hind his team.
I would want the guy that can 
sit on the bench with the head-phones on so he can still help his teammate on the ﬁ  eld.
I would want the guy who has 
his helmet nearby so he can jump over the goal line for one play.
“I’m not going to say it hasn’t 
been difﬁ  cult,” Driskel said. “But 
at the end of the day I’m still do-
ing what I’ve always done. I’m still preparing to be ready to go in and make plays if my number 
gets called. That’s what I owe this 
team.”
Hear that Leon? That’s what a team player 
sounds like.3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2014

2 Chainz only wore one chain last night, 
and Action Bronson wished he could “light 
some weed up” with fans.  
The two rappers performed to a half-
empty Stephen C. O’Connell Center on Thursday night, but fans’ hype ﬁ  lled the gaps.
Floor seats sold out in the ﬁ  rst week, 
event organizers said, but tickets for stadi-um seating were still available up until the show started. About 2,900 people vibed to the rappers.
People were still ﬁ  ling into their seats 
as Action Bronson busted onto the stage, starting out leisurely strolling and rapping “Action Silverado” from his mixtape “Blue 
Chips 2.” He doused himself with a wa-
ter bottle and proceeded to cycle through songs until he hopped off stage and into the crowd.
Bronson was full of action that night.
He traveled through the ﬂ  oor seats and 
rapped his way up to the center bleachers 
and then to the bleachers to stage right, all as fans snapped selﬁ  es.
The O’Connell Center security was pre-
pared, though, and followed him through to stage left — all while keeping their lights trained on the acrobatic Bronson, who hurtled himself over the blue barri-

Kathleen O’Leary received a con-
ﬁ  rmation email Wednesday night 
for a ﬂ  ight she never booked.
The UF English and history se-
nior was one of many students who 
received an accidental email around 
6 p.m. Wednesday from StudentU-niverse, a business that provides students with discount travel and lodging prices nationwide. 
The email told students and past 
customers that the company had received their payment for a group ﬂ  ight, which didn’t exist. StudentU-
niverse sent the email as a result of 
an internal human error, said public relations manager Danielle Miller-ick. 
“We extend our deepest apolo-
gies to anyone who was concerned about a charge to their credit card, or their personal information as a result of receiving this email,” she said. 
Millerick said no personal in-
formation has been leaked and the email is unrelated to actual transac-tion data. StudentUniverse was also never hacked, according to its web-
site. 
O’Leary, 21, said a friend initially 
texted her after receiving the Stu-
dentUniverse email and suggested that O’Leary check her inbox, too. O’Leary saw the email at about 8 p.m. 
“I feel like things like this just 
happen, and you just hope they 
don’t happen to you, and they don’t 
steal your credit card information,” O’Leary said. 
At about 10 p.m., O’Leary said 
she found out the email was an ac-cident via StudentUniverse’s Twit-ter account. StudentUniverse then emailed all of those affected by the mistake Thursday morning, apolo-
gizing for the mishap. 
“I’m going to think again before 
I consider them,” she said. “They al-
ready have my contact information, but it might be a good idea to kind of just clear all of that out.”
Last Spring Break, O’Leary said 
she used StudentUniverse to book a ﬂ  ight to Washington, D.C. The StudentUniverse email a mistake
“You just have to accept 
the possibility but hope that 
the refund process works 
pretty well.”

� ABOUT 100 CATS AND DOGS ARE AVAILABLE.

About 100 cats and dogs will be ready for adoption 
this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at PetSmart’s fourth 
and final “Adopt-a-thon” of the year.
With the help of Helping Hands Pet Rescue and lo-
cal volunteers, PetSmart gives about 100 cats and dogs homes four times a year at the event, which is part of a national campaign. Pet product manager Jennifer Brown 
said the Archer Road store ranked No. 1 nationwide last 
year.
“We’re very successful with adoptions at this loca-
tion,” Brown said.
PetSmart offers adoption services every weekend, 
said store manager Mark Frantz, but the event this weekend “is the big one that’s done nationally.”  The potential house pets are mainly provided by local 
shelters, including Alachua County Animal Services.
Helping Hands Pet Rescue pulls most of its cats and 
dogs from shelters, and it is a “last-chance” destination for the homeless animals, said board member Kristi 
Herniman.
She said adoption fees will be waived for long-term 
resident dogs who have spent more than three months 
in a shelter.
“We don’t do ‘free adoptions’ because it makes peo-
ple think they can just snatch them out of their cage,” Herniman said.PetSmart hosts weekend Adopt-a-thon

The competition for frugal fashion is kicking up a 
notch at The Oaks Mall.
Swedish franchise H&M announced this week 
the retailer would open a store in Gainesville in the 
spring.
And it’s settling in across the hall from giant mall 
tenant and competitor Forever 21.
“To be honest, I’m not really concerned at all,” said 
Giovanni Arroyo, the visual co-manager for the Oaks Mall Forever 21. “If anything, I’m excited because of 
the competition that it’s going to bring. I feel compa-
nies need competition to thrive.”
The 23,000-square-foot Oaks Mall H&M will occupy 
the space across from Forever 21 that includes PacSun, 
which will move to a smaller spot near Express.
Jordan Sun, assistant store manager at the Oaks Mall 
PacSun, said rumors of an H&M have been circulating 
in the mall since last spring, but the general consensus among managers and customers is excitement.
“It’s another fast fashion outlet for people to go to,” 
Sun said. “And more people seem to fit the description of what an H&M customer looks like.”
Sun, who is also a 22-year-old UF science in man-
agement graduate student, said the store offers a lot of basic and professional attire that will appeal to a col-lege crowd.
“It’s super cost-friendly, especially for college stu-
dents who need something quick for a job fair,” he said.
Sun said PacSun’s new location will offer more 
merchandise, thanks to a remodeled layout.
“It’s kind of like addition by subtraction,” he said.To gear up for all of the mall’s changes, Arroyo said 
he has been cracking down on his team to make sure the store is in excellent condition.
“We definitely want to bring in new customers and 
still keep our loyal customers when H&M does arrive,” Arroyo said. “The whole point is that they will have to walk through our store first. If we can get them to, then we can get them before H&M does.”H&M coming to 
Oaks Mall, to open across Forever 21LocALmunity Response Council, which will be es-
tablished in response to the Ferguson shooting to avoid a similar situation.
The council will include city leaders, in-
cluding the police chief, business leaders and 
members of UF and Santa Fe College. 
“In the case of a worst-case scenario, we 
want our community to be able to have the 
conﬁ  dence in the local authorities and a trans-parent and real path to justice,” Braddy said. 
The think tank was preceded by three in-
formation sessions on race relations, solutions to discrimination and its toxicity on health to provide an important introduction to the dis-
cussions, said Michael Bowie, director of Re-
cruitment, Retention & Multicultural Affairs for the UF College of Education. 
There were six panelists, including Braddy, 
Paul Ortiz of the Samuel Proctor History Pro-gram and UF Provost Joe Glover, who were asked questions on race issues within the com-munity by six leaders from organizations, in-cluding the Institute of Black Culture and UF 
Student Affairs.“I am committed to diversity,” Glover said. 
“It needs the attention every year. We need to 
pay attention to it constantly.”
He said he’s aware of the problem of the 
low number of minorities, but by law, the uni-
versity can’t target any group. UF has strate-
gies and ideas, like more holistic admissions criteria and evaluations. 
“It is a difﬁ  cult problem, and we’re not 
happy with the state of the problem,” he said. “It’s not easy.”
Then the audience asked questions. Some 
graduate students expressed safety concerns on campus. Glover passed the microphone to 
University Police Chief Linda Stump. 
“We encourage you to come to us about 
frustrations,” she said. “You have a voice, and 
you can be heard.” 
Glover said UF is recognized as one of the 
top producers of African Americans with mas-ters and Ph.Ds in the nation by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Education.
“We’re doing pretty well at the graduate 
level, but it’s more of a challenge at the under-graduate level,” he said.
ﬂ  ight was snowed out, and she 
received a full refund from the company without hassle.
“You can’t live under a 
rock,” O’Leary said. “You just 
have to accept the possibility 
but hope that the refund pro-cess works pretty well.”
Joseph Wilson, a professor 
in UF’s Department of Com-puter and Information Science and Engineering, said students encountering similar emails or phishing attempts should re-
port the email to UF as soon as 
possible.
“It’s not all that strange,” he said. “Mistakes are going to happen whenever humans are involved.”
Wilson said students should 
always make sure the web-site where they’re entering 
their information is secure. He 
warned that students should avoid connecting to public Wi-Fi, although UF’s Wi-Fi is much safer. 
Students should also use 
credit cards instead of debit cards whenever possible, ac-cording to Wilson, because 
there’s a smaller chance of li-
ability.
“Any time you give info to 
anybody, it’s essentially com-promised,” he said.Email was result of 
internal human error ers and white barricades into the 
crowd stage left.
“That was a pretty impressive 
display of athleticism by me right there,” he said after hopping out of the barricaded area back on stage.
Bronson brought fans back to 
the ‘80s, “my period of growth,” he said, before he freestyled over popular ‘80s pop hits, including “Sussudio” by Phil Collins, and 
belting out, “Is there any more 
room for me in those jeans,” in his rendition of “In Those Jeans” by Ginuwine.
Fans of the athletic Action 
Bronson hailed from around the state.
Nate Robbins, a 22-year-old 
business management senior at 
the University of South Florida, and Khadijah Ogutu, a 24-year-
old speech pathology USF junior, 
drove the two hours to UF for Ac-
tion Bronson, one of their favor-ite artists.
“Last year, I told him ‘You 
have to hear this song,’” said 
Ogutu. “It was from a band from 
my hometown called The Ground Up. He was like, ‘Dude, that’s Action Bronson!’”
Bronson was encircled by fans 
who were able to rap alongside him.
Will Cox was in his bleacher 
seat stage right when Bronson 
stopped next to him to rap.
“I didn’t even know he was 
allowed to go off stage,” he said, 
“but it added to the hype, it made 
him more real.”
The 21-year-old UF advertis-
ing junior has been listening to 
Bronson since he played basket-ball for Edgewater High School in Orlando. His teammates in-troduced him to the New York-
based rapper, and he’s been a fan 
since.
Action Bronson’s antics would 
have been hard to follow for less-er rappers, but 2 Chainz brought 
people to their feet, crowding in 
front of the stage, shouting en-thusiastic “SKRT SKRT”s along to his opening song, “Fork.”
Malcolm Perez-Rios was one 
of the fans shouting along.
“I went more for Action Bron-
son,” the 18-year-old UF telecom-munication freshman said. “But 2 
Chainz had really good energy.”
Chainz’ energy bounced off 
the crowd and reverberated 
through the stands as fans ﬁ  lled 
in intentional gaps in the lyrics of 
his rendition of “All Me,” usually featuring Drake and Big Sean.
“He performed so well,” Per-
ez-Rios said.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2014

Holiday music will echo throughout the 
Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on 
Sunday as Mannheim Steamroller takes the stage.
The musical group is stopping in 
Gainesville at 7:30 p.m. as part of its 30th anni-versary tour and plays modern, instrumental versions of traditional Christmas music under the illumination of a festive light show. Tick-ets are $10 for UF students, $35 for balcony seats, $45 to $60 for orchestra seating and $60 for pit seating and can be purchased online or over the phone.
The concert is expected to ﬁ  ll the Phillips 
Center close to capacity, said Amy Douglas, performing arts spokeswoman.
“No matter what religion you practice or 
what you believe, the holidays can be a magi-cal and wonderful time,” she said. “They can also be a little lonely for students who are away from home. Hopefully, the concert can help alleviate that.”
Douglas said the group has performed on 
campus before, most recently in 2010. And al-though Christmas is not until next month, she said Gainesville is one of the tour’s ﬁ  rst stops.
UF physics and mathematics senior Jacob 
Fjeldheim said music like Mannheim Steam-roller gets him excited for the holidays.
“It’s important to experience music of the 
season, a cultural staple, regardless of creed or religion,” the 21-year-old said.UF hosts night

The faces of the 43 slain 
Mexican students were illu-
minated by candles at a vigil 
held on Turlington Plaza on 
Thursday night.
On the plaza, about 15 
students gathered around 
the black-and-white pictures 
of students who were killed in Iguala, Mexico.
Students for Justice in 
Palestine and Students for 
a Democratic Society orga-
nized the candlelight vigil for the students. The Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Teach-ers College of Ayotzinapa students were ﬁ  rst reported 
missing on Sept. 26.
In September the mayor 
of Iguala, José Luis Abarca, 
ordered police to round up 
the students out of fear that 
they would protest a speech by his wife. Per Abarca’s re-quest, police then handed the students over to a gang 
called Guerreros Unidos that 
shot and burned the bodies, according to The New York Times.
Family members of the 
victims are still trying to identify the remains, some of which were placed in gar-bage bags.
Jonathan Waring, the 20-
year-old president of the Stu-dents for a Democratic Soci-ety, said the tragedy hit close 
to home for the UF organi-
zation because the 43 young men were political activists. The students were protesting discriminatory hiring prac-
tices of teachers.     
“We’re here to honor their 
memory, and it’s important 
for us to humanize these 
victims,” the UF psychology 
sophomore said.Waring said the tragedy 
has not received much media coverage in the U.S.
Farah Khan, the 20-year-
old vice president of Students for Justice in Palestine, said students often go missing in 
Palestine because of protest-
ing their political beliefs.
“As activists, we felt like 
we had a duty to honor them,” the UF English junior 
said. “It’s important for us 
because we are student ac-tivists.”
After the last candle was 
lit, students’ names were listed.
“We stand in solidar-
ity with all political activists who are representing for all 
they believe in,” said Tes-
neem Shraiteh, a  20-year-old UF linguistics junior and president of Students for Jus-
tice in Palestine.
In response to the massa-
cre, protesters in Mexico set 
ﬁ  re to legislature and admin-istrative buildings in Chil-
pancingo, according to NBC 
News.
Xochitl Lopez, a Mexican-
American student, said look-ing at the faces of the young victims reminded her of her 
country.  The 19-year-old UF 
biology and chemistry fresh-man said she feels Mexico 
is often forgotten, but while 
looking at the faces of the missing students, she felt close to them.
“It feels nice to be ac-
knowledged for this cause,” Lopez said.Candlelit vigil honors slain Mexican students

Earlier this week, President Barack Obama announced his 
pick for the attorney general spot being vacated by Eric Holder. Obama selected Loretta Lynch, a New York fed-
eral prosecutor known as a strong defender of civil rights. In its rush to demean and tarnish Lynch’s image in any way possible, 
the conservative media quickly jumped on a supposed news 
bombshell: Andrew Breitbart posted a story with the headline “Obama’s Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch represent-ed Clintons during Whitewater.” Whitewater refers to the real estate scandal that surfaced during the Clinton administration. There’s only one problem: The Loretta Lynch who represented the Clintons is a completely different person. Before the article was completely removed, Breitbart issued what might be the worst correction of all time: He put the word “corrected” at the 
end of the headline and placed the following sentence at the end 
of the article: “Correction: The Loretta Lynch identiﬁ  ed earlier as the Whitewater attorney was, in fact, a different attorney.” A journalistic-malpractice-on-steroids DART to Breitbart.
Two years ago, Simpsons co-creator Sam Simon received 
horrible medical news: Simon was diagnosed with stage-4 co-lon cancer and was told he had only three to six months to live. Regardless of exactly how much time Simon has left, he is mak-ing the most of it — he recently announced his plan to donate 
his entire $100 million fortune to charity. In a time when the 
fabulously wealthy are less likely than ever to give to charity, it’s nice to see Simon setting an example, even under such aw-ful circumstances. We’re giving a giving-done-right LAUREL  
to Sam Simon.
The Kardashian family was in the news this week for ridic-
ulous reasons, as usual. Most notably, Kim appeared in Paper Magazine ﬂ  aunting her assets in full-frontal fashion. However, not content to cede the spotlight to her sister, Khloe decided to 
post a massively offensive meme on her Instagram. The post fea-
tured a picture of Khloe, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian with the text: “The only KKK to ever let black men in.” Though, in a situation involving a Kardashian, that’s probably not much of a surprise. A why-are-you-famous-again? DART to Khloe Kar-
dashian.
In the aftermath of a massive victory by Republicans in last 
week’s elections, the Democratic Party has begun a process of soul-searching in preparation for the next round of elections in 
2016. One of the major reasons for the failure of Democrats to 
gain any traction at the national level is their inability to proj-ect a strong, clear and uniﬁ  ed message. In a striking departure from their usual apologetic weakness, Democrats made the wise decision of appointing Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma., to a Sen-ate leadership position. Warren will be responsible for articulat-ing and promoting Democratic messages and policies. In terms of a passionate political advocate and someone who connects with ordinary Americans, it’s hard to do better than Warren. A ﬁ  nally-moving-in-the-right-direction LAUREL to Senate 
Democrats.US-China climate agreement a good start
In the past week, we have seen a spacecraft land on 
a comet, and we’ve seen Kim Kardashian’s glazed donuts. But what most people haven’t talked about 
— or seem to be interested in — is the recent historic climate agreement between the U.S. and China.
In a secret joint deal between White House ofﬁ  cials 
and the Chinese government, the U.S. agreed to cut car-
bon emission 25 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. 
In turn, the Chinese government will peak its fossil fuel production earlier than usual in 2030, while simultane-ously increasing nonfossil fuel production to account for 20 percent of the country’s energy. 
This is big news for the ﬁ  ght against climate change 
because of the fact that the U.S. and China happen to be the world’s biggest carbon emitters, and formally com-mitting to change just might save the planet.
It is also important to mention that the Americans 
and the Chinese are seen as antagonists on the world stage. This agreement shows that the Obama admin-istration and President Xi Jinping see the severity of climate change’s effects on their countries and econo-
mies.
Other parts of the deal include cooperation on clean 
energy research and development, including a pilot 
program in China that seeks to capture carbon emission 
through underground sequestration.
It is important to emphasize that this climate agree-
ment can be a really big deal, but only if each country 
does its part. The agreement is not legally binding in any way and will not be until the U.N. convenes to re-
sume climate talks.
These U.N. talks are difﬁ  cult primarily because the 
core dispute is about who should bear the responsibility 
of cutting carbon emissions. 
Poorer countries argue that rich nations are and have 
been the main contributors to climate change. Richer nations argue that poorer nations, who are exploding their use of fossil fuels, will ne-gate their carbon reductions. It is incredibly difﬁ  cult to get 
past the blame game with so 
many conﬂ  icting interests in one body.
It will also be difﬁ  cult to 
carry out the changes in the respective countries, especially 
because Republicans, who will dominate both houses of Congress over the next two years, have opposed this deal, citing it as a commitment to the “war on coal.” And 
executive actions signed by the president would cripple 
prospective climate talks (if that is even possible).
But after this climate deal, attacks on EPA regulations 
will be seen as an attack on the China deal and on global 
efforts to stop global warming. It will also be difﬁ  cult 
because the U.S. will have to make large spending cuts in an effort to shrink the deﬁ  cit and reduce the debt.
If a miracle occurs at the U.N. and both countries 
agree to a deal, the rest of the world will follow suit. 
This agreement is the ﬁ  rst step on a long road to action 
on climate. 
We should all be happy to have an administration 
committed to leaving a somewhat healthy planet for fu-
ture generations. 
Some representatives in Congress are still debat-
ing whether this global warming even exists, despite 
the overwhelming scientiﬁ  c evidence demonstrating it does.
An assortment of hurdles need to be overcome: bind-
ing the deal through the U.N., overcoming Republicans in Congress and budget constraints and actually meet-ing the goals set during the last nine months. It won’t be 
easy, but it can and must be done.

I sincerely hope that everyone here in Gainesville had 
a great Veterans Day. Remembering those who have served our country — both the living and those who 
have passed away or died in action — is incredibly im-portant. Our government is right to set aside a day for celebration and respect for the brave human beings who lay down their lives in the name of protecting every citi-
zen of the U.S. Whether you agree with the military poli-
cies and actions the U.S. government has taken through-out history, the sacriﬁ  ces made by our soldiers should never be diminished.
However, besides this nation-
al day of remembrance, it seems that the U.S. government has done little to show its apprecia-tion and gratitude for the veter-
ans who have risked their lives 
upholding the very foundations of the U.S. government. Our soldiers are lauded on Veterans Day, but often, living veterans 
who need help, support, health care and employment 
are forgotten and disrespected every other day of the year.
According to the National Coalition for Homeless 
Veterans, homeless veterans make up 12 percent of the homeless population in the U.S., with 50,000 veterans who have no homes to call their own every night spread across the cities that have prospered and become the booming economic and cultural hubs of the world be-
cause of the sacriﬁ  ces of these very individuals. Sadly, 
the state of Florida has one of the highest populations of homeless veterans. Along with California and New York, Florida accounts for 44 percent of these former 
soldiers.
America also doesn’t provide proper health care or 
mental health counseling for its veterans, which only in-
creases the homeless population every year. There are a startling estimated 25 percent of young veterans return-
ing home from Iraq and Afghanistan who suffer from 
various mental disorders, according to a CNN study. Soldiers also have a rate of major depression that is ﬁ  ve times higher than that of civilians.
When young men and women return from ﬁ  ghting 
for the U.S., our government fails in its duty to care for and heal its own. The U.S government has often had is-sues protecting its soldiers in recent years, seen in the high rate of sexual assault that occurs in the military and 
the scandal involving the delay of health care services 
of recently returned soldiers that occurred in Phoenix earlier this year. The fact that so many soldiers remain homeless and unsupported when they return from ser-
vice only increases the government’s failure to recognize 
and respect these men and women who risk and lose their lives. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs can-not sufﬁ  ciently care for the high number of individuals who need help and requires more funding to adequately 
provide services.
Monuments, salutes of respect and ribbons splashed 
with red, white and blue are very important. They dem-
onstrate respect to the soldiers who have died on our be-
half, but there are thousands of veterans who are alive, 
who have returned to the U.S. and now are suffering in silence, with little support from the very country they dedicated their lives to.
We should remember these veterans for more than 
just one day every year. The U.S. owes every veteran the support they need to live happily in this beautiful coun-try they have sacriﬁ  ced so much for.

opinions@alligator.orgIt’s my favorite time of the year. The 
leaves are changing color — as much as they can in Florida — it’s chilly 
enough to drink hot chocolate, and the beards — oh, the beards! — are growing again, thanks to No Shave November.
I’ll admit it: I’m a big fan of the scruffy 
look. No Shave November is what I look forward to post-Halloween and pre-Christmas. Forget about turkey — No-vember’s all about hair.
The premise behind No Shave November is to raise 
awareness for cancer — most often cancers affecting men, like prostate or testicular — by growing out your body hair.
In terms of what hair you can quit grooming, 
here’s what my extensive research — namely reading blogs and tracking #NoShaveNovember on Twitter — found.
Beards are totally acceptable to grow out. Men’s 
facial hair? Go for it. 
Woman-identiﬁ  ed individuals can grow out leg 
hair, as long as they’re prepared to participate in “No D December,” too.
But pubic hair? For any gender on the spectrum, 
don’t even think about growing that out.
One Yik Yak user anonymously posted a more 
accurate name for the month: “no-shave-except-for-your-genitals-please-for-the-love-of-god-shave-your-genitals November.”
Why have we adopted this “hair today, gone to-
morrow” attitude, though?
A 2011 article from The Atlantic asks the question, 
“Has pubic hair in America gone extinct?” While pu-
bic hair might not be gone for good, per se, the below-
the-belt-grooming routine has become more popular. The Atlantic article blames this mainly on porn and skimpy lingerie and bathing suits.
I’ll play devil’s advocate and represent the unpop-
ular opinion here: put the razors down, folks.
I’m going to be honest — probably a little too much 
— with you all. You’ll never ﬁ  nd me at a waxing ap-pointment. I’m a poor college student who’s afraid of 
pain, I hate shaving, and ingrown hairs suck.
As is, my shaving routine is exhausting. If you 
shave, you probably know this to be true. Shaving just my legs and underarms takes about 
20 minutes every other day.
Shaving my nether regions takes about 
another half hour if I actually want it to look nice, a whole lot of patience and probably a glass of wine to cut the frus-tration.
I don’t like the look, either. I already 
look pretty young — seriously, I could or-der off the kid’s menu and no one would 
think twice — so shaving everything off makes me feel too much like Lolita for comfort.
I used to put more effort into the bare look, but it 
got too tiring, especially because I was doing it since I thought that’s what was expected of me.
I thought my partners would be super disgusted 
by the natural look, and while I’m sure some people deﬁ  nitely are, I haven’t had a real problem with it. No one has made any comment about the state of my pu-bic hair, probably because, well, it’s not a big deal.
On the ﬂ  ip side, one story from The Atlantic article 
recalls a student who “had never hooked up with a girl who had pubic hair, and would frankly be dis-gusted to undress a woman and discover a veil of genital fur.”
The article doesn’t mention the fact that this guy 
shouldn’t even be seeing naked people because he’s clearly 13 years old. 
If a little hair is all it takes to turn you off, you’re 
not mature enough to be having sex.
When it comes down to it, the best thing about 
your pubic hair is that, well, it’s your pubic hair, so do what you want with it!
If you think you look great with a bush, grow it all 
out. If you prefer it bald, shave everything. If you’ve got some creativity and you’re nimble with a razor, turn your hair into a work of art.
Don’t plan your grooming ritual around what you 
think is expected of you —  just do what makes you 
comfortable. 
And be my guest if you want to match your car-
pet to your drapes and shave your pubic region along 
with your beard.

PROGRAM’S GOAL FOR 2015.
TAYLOR RUSSELL 
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability is launch-
ing a pilot program to make Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n 
Stadium the ﬁ  rst zero-waste stadium in the Southeastern Conference.
For the last home game of the 2014 season 
against Eastern Kentucky University, ofﬁ  ce volunteers will stand at each bin inside the stadium to help fans recycle and compost.
The program is part of UF’s efforts to be-come a zero-waste campus by 2015. The uni-versity created this goal after UF President Bernie Machen addressed the issue on Sus-tainability Day in 2005, said Allison Vitt, the outreach and communications coordinator for the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
However, Vitt said not all of the stadium’s 
waste can be recycled or composted. The Of-ﬁ  ce of Sustainability’s real goal is to divert 90 percent of the waste from landﬁ  lls.
She said the ofﬁ  ce can control what is sold 
and the type of packaging used for the food and beverages in the stadium.
Waste Corporation of America picks up 
waste for UF. It then hauls the organic and 
compostable materials to its partner, Watson C&D, where it is mixed with residential yard 
waste.
“We are glad that all of UF is under one 
umbrella, using the same waste partner to have a cohesive recycling program,” Vitt said.
The TailGator Game Day Recycling Pro-
gram, another university effort to become zero waste, began in 2006 when the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability was founded. Volunteers attend tailgates on home gamedays and hand out re-cycling bags to be picked up later.
At the start of the 2013 football season, 28 
percent of waste was diverted from landﬁ  lls. By the end, 78 percent was diverted.
 “It’s really been a learning process, and we 
are getting better and better every game,” Vitt said.
The ofﬁ  ce is working with stadium vendors 
to switch to more compostable materials.  
Environmental engineering sophomore 
Kate Lewis said she is proud to attend a uni-versity that places value on making the envi-ronment cleaner.
“Spreading awareness is a major step in cre-
ating a greener Earth,” the 19-year-old said. Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n aims to be ﬁ  rst zero-waste stadium in SEC 
“The zero-waste goal is deﬁ  ned 
as more of an ideal instead of a 
number.”

OF ABOUT 50 NOMINATIONS.

Eight local businesses were 
recognized Thursday night at 
the Gainesville Area Chamber of commerce’s Business of the Year Awards.
The chamber received more than 
50 nominations for the awards, said event manager Mallory Thompson. Most applications were for more general categories like Overall Small Business and Overall Large Busi-ness, but specialized categories like Leading Women’s Enterprise and Best Minority Business also had 
contenders.
An anonymous panel of cham-
ber stakeholders with no tie to the 
contenders judged the competition, which was hosted at the Hilton Uni-versity of Florida Conference Center Gainesville.
The ceremony’s presenting event 
sponsor was Northwestern Mutual, 
Thompson said.“This event is important because 
it brings together businesses from 
across all industries who all have 
one thing in common: a heart for 
this Gainesville community and a desire to see it grow,” she said.
Stephanie Darilus, 22, said she 
thinks the annual awards serve as an inspiration to the community.
“It is very important that they 
are recognized for their hard work so that they can continue to provide 
quality work,” the UF political sci-
ence senior said.
Other businesses can use the 
winners as a gauge for their own success, as well, which will make them work harder, she said.
Darilus has taken yoga classes at 
Gainesville Health & Fitness Center — the winner of the Best Business 
Expansion award — for the past 
year and a half.
She credits the gym’s staff and 
welcoming environment for the business’ success.
“The ﬁ  rst time I took the class, the 
teacher made me feel very welcome, and she was very patient,” she said. “A business is nothing without efﬁ  -
cient and well-minded staff.”Businesses given best of year awardsMELISSA MIHM

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Wednesday night after 
police said he sent a string 
of about 30 threatening text 
messages to another man. 
Dwayne Javon Robinson, 
30, recently broke up with 
his girlfriend and blamed the 
male victim and the victim’s girlfriend. 
He said the victim told 
Robinson’s girlfriend that 
Robinson had a “dirty d**k,” 
according to a report.
The ﬁ  rst text message Rob-
inson sent the victim said, 
“Boy, I sure hope someone 
knows how to f*****g ﬁ  ght! Str8 up!”
The threatening messages 
from Robinson kept ﬂ  owing.
“N***a f**k all dat im bout 
respect F***boy now ima bust yo a** up an show you im not f*****g playing p***y n***a.”
As the day continued, so 
did the texts.
“I mean this on my soul!! 
Yo a** mine n***a so I hope you can ﬁ  ght.”
“You gonna be mad if I go 
way more in on you about you so just s**t the f*** up 
and give me my fade or ima 
force it an just rush up yo a** like ima ready to do TODAY soon is I get off work yo ass 
mine B***HN***A.”
The victim and his girl-
friend have a child together 
and said the text messages caused them to fear for their 
lives. 
“When I get off work just 
be ready cus ima beat yo 
ole a** in front of you lady I mean this on my soul!!”
When Gainesville Police 
were investigating the inci-dent, the victim’s girlfriend told police she saw a mo-tion sensor light on a nearby house go on and off within a 
few minutes. 
Ofﬁ  cers began walking 
over to the house and saw 
Robinson come out from a 
wooded area near the mo-
tion light. He quickly walked away from police, who caught up with him at 1900 NW 55th Ave. at about 8 
p.m.
Robinson is currently on 
probation for aggravated 
stalking after injunction, ac-
cording to a report.
He was arrested on charg-
es of cyber stalking, loitering-
and-prowling and violation of his probation. His bond is 
set at $20,000. 
■   ■   ■
A Wal-Mart employee 
was arrested Wednesday af-ternoon after police said she 
stole more than $8,000 from a cash register over the course of three weeks. 
From Oct. 25 to Sunday, 
29-year-old Muriel Naomi Dawkins was seen on store surveillance cameras taking money from various cash 
registers and hiding it in 
her clothing at the Wal-Mart located at 5700 NW 23rd St. She took out as much as $1,620 and as little as $23 at 
a time. 
Dawkins was arrested 
shortly after 4 p.m. on charg-
es of fraud and grand theft. 
She was released Thursday at 
5:25 p.m. on a $15,000 bond. Police roundup:

Alligator Writer @graham_hack24
Conventional isn’t a four letter word, but 
for Christen Westphal, it might as well be.
If you tried to put her into a mold, she 
wouldn’t ﬁ  t.
Even if she could, she wouldn’t want to.
In three years at the University of Florida, 
Christen has become the rock of the Gator backline, the most reliable defender in a star-
studded defense that makes it difﬁ  cult for 
even the most talented players to get time on the ﬁ  eld.
But Christen rarely comes off the ﬁ  eld – 
even when games are well in hand – not only because of her defensive prowess, but also be-
cause of her impact on the offense.
Even though she plays as a central de-
fender, Christen plays a point guard-like role, 
distributing the ball to her teammates to start offensive attacks. She is also given freedom to roam forward, sometimes getting as far as the opposing team’s penalty box in open play.
The skill and conﬁ  dence required to play 
such a multi-faceted position usually comes 
from playing the same role for an entire ca-
reer.
But for Christen, it’s quite the opposite.

Growing up in Brecksville, Ohio, she picked 
up basketball from her father, David Westphal – a former collegiate player at Washington and Jefferson College – and dabbled in many dif-ferent sports. But Christen said “soccer was 
always the one that kinda just stuck.”
She grew up with the game, kicking a ball 
around as early as 4-years-old from what her 
father remembers. But Christen doesn’t re-member a time without it. Soccer just was.
She played the sport year-round, despite 
the dead, frozen winter ﬁ  elds that made play-ing outside virtually impossible for much of the year. She used indoor facilities to play when she could during those months, but more often than not, she would simply prac-tice by herself in her family’s basement – there 
are still holes in the wall to prove it.
Although she possessed natural ath-
leticism, Christen wasn’t a natural when she 
ﬁ  rst touched a soccer ball, but her unspoken dedication to get better is what her father says made her such a good player. 
“I always call her my quiet assassin,” Da-
vid said. “She tells you what she’s gonna do once, and then she goes about doing it, never 
tells you again and then all of a sudden you 
look up and what she wanted to accomplish she’s accomplished.”

By the time Christen got to high school, it 
was time to look up.
Athleticism had turned to skill; repetition 
to instinct; awareness to action.
She lived and breathed the game of soccer. 
The talent which had blossomed from her ef-forts was now second to none.
So much so that her coaches had difﬁ  culty 
deciding which position she should play.
Christen was good at everything.“I swear I played every position,” Christen 
said.
And she came close.Her high school coach used her primarily 
in the center midﬁ  eld, a position from which she scored 14 goals in her ﬁ  nal two seasons 
while helping Walsh Jesuit High to the 2010 
Division I state title in her junior year. 
But her club coach, Zdravko Popovic, 
played her as a “sweeper,” an old-school de-fensive position that acts as the ﬁ  nal barrier before the goalkeeper. And in games where the team was trailing, he would put Christen in at forward to give the offense a boost.
Many players might resist the idea of play-
ing so many positions, but Christen embraced the challenge, realizing the more she could do, the better she would be.Her versatility and attitude – along with her 
talent – caught the eye of Florida head coach Becky Burleigh, who said she knew Christen would be a unique player from the beginning of the recruiting process.
“I think it’s really unusual to ﬁ  nd a defend-
er that has as much sophistication offensively as she does,” Burleigh said.
Christen immediately fell in love with UF 
and committed as a central defender shortly after her visit. She came into her freshman year halfheartedly hoping to start, but not truly expecting it.
But after coming off the bench in the ﬁ  rst 
game of the season, her skill on and off the ball was too much to ignore. She started the next four games, and after an injury sidelined star defender Kat Williamson for two months, her 
position in the starting lineup was cemented 
for the rest of the season.
She’s started every game in her career 
since.

Even after a successful freshman campaign 
in which she was named to the SEC second team and SEC freshman team, Christen knew she couldn’t be satisﬁ  ed with what she had ac-
complished.
That following summer, she spent her va-
cation at home in Ohio working on her game with Popovic, her former club coach.
“I think after her ﬁ  rst year, she found out 
that there was a need to do even more,” Pop-
ovic said. “The result of it was she was com-mitted to do whatever it takes. She was here on a daily basis training at six o’clock in the morning … I think that type of commitment and determination is an integral part of her success today.”
Although that commitment has led to much 
of her success, Christen believes she wouldn’t be where she is today had she not played so many positions and been stretched as a player in so many ways throughout her career.
She attributes her on-ball defensive skills to 
having played offense for so many years.
“I think it helps that I know (the offensive 
player’s) mentality, when they’re trying to at-
tack,” she said, “so it’s kinda easy to be one 
step ahead, kinda knowing where they wanna go with the ball.”
And now that she’s a leader on the team, 
she can also use her experience to help her teammates.
“I kinda know the general ‘where they 
should be and how it should look,’” she said. “As a freshman, I was really hesitant to say 
things ‘cause I didn’t wanna say the wrong 
thing, but now I know the formation and ev-erything, I feel comfortable leading people and telling them where to go.”
Despite the amount of time Christen has 
spent playing as both a forward and mid-ﬁ  elder in her career, she said she doesn’t miss playing up front. She likes her role in the of-fense as is.
However, she said she would be ready to 
step up and play a more offensive position if the team needed her to do so. Burleigh had Christen play forward in the spring to give her more experience with the ball.
But her heart belongs to the defensive side 
of the game. 
She relishes the opportunity to shut down 
a cocky forward with a no-nonsense tackle.
And although being a star center-back is 
a dream come true for Christen, it’s a dream she never imagined while playing forward as a young teenager in Ohio – a dream she wouldn’t have believed even if you told her.
“No, not at all,” she said. “If you had told 
me that, I would have been – obviously super happy – but I would have never pictured my-self like that.”
Who would have? It goes against all con-
ventional wisdom.
But then again, Christen Westphal doesn’t 
do conventional.10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2014

Taylor Tubbs and the 
UF cross country team travel to Tallahassee for NCAA Regionals. Read 
the story on Page 15.Dagostino acing it
UF volleyball setter Mackenzie Dagostino is averaging .52 service aces per set, which is ﬁ  rst in the SEC and sixth nationally.Team Captains
UF coach Will Muschamp announced Thursday that center Max Garcia and linebackers Antonio Morrison, Neiron Ball and Mike Taylor will be team captains for Florida’s game against South Carolina on Saturday.We know what you’re thinking 
Gator fans.
Two wins in a row. 
Away from home.With one of them against Georgia.
Who in the world saw that coming?
And now, after a four-week hiatus, 
Florida is ready to compete in front of its home crowd when it takes on South Carolina on Saturday to have a third straight Southeastern Conference vic-tory.
It may seem like it has been a long 
time since the Gators won back-to-
back-to-back SEC games, but you only 
have to look back to last season — yes, that year when UF went 4-8 — when Florida defeated Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas all in a row.
Immediately after that, the Gators 
dropped their next seven.
But instead of dwelling on the past, 
it’s time to move forward.
Now onto the picks!
In ﬁ  rst place at an even 43-43 is the 
Orlando Sentinel’s “Blind-eye” Edgar 
Thompson, who struggled for what seemed like an eternity on Tuesday to ﬁ  nd his recorder while we were conducting player interviews when it 
turned out he dropped it right outside 
the media room. Really, Edgar? Were 
you just upset that your boy Ke-Ke 
wasn’t available?
In second place with a 42-44 record 
is alligatorSprots staff writer Jonathan 
“I just wanted to hear the ﬁ  ddle” Czu-pryn, who spent $20 on two different occasions to hear Alabama’s “Dixieland Delight” while the alligatorSports road crew was in Nashville, Tennessee, last 
week. Wow, Zoop. What happened to 
spending your dollar (on beer) parked in a holler ‘neath the mountain moon-light?
In third place at 41-45 is alligator-
Sports staff writer Morgan “No show” Moriarty, who was noticeably absent from football media this week. I guess 
that time in Nashville took too much 
out of you, huh Morgan?Picks

Tonight could be history in the making 
for the Florida basketball program. Game 1 
of UF’s 2014-15 basketball season tips off at 
6 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. The game will also serve as UF’s ﬁ  rst ever matchup against William & Mary of the Colonial Ath-
letic Association.
“You’re going to be playing against a team that’s going to run the Princeton style. 
They are really good in terms of passing, cut-ting, moving,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
“They utilize the 3-point line very well, 
they get you on back cuts for layups. They’re 
a team that stays true to their system, their 
style of play and what they’re doing.”
The No. 7 Gators have never lost a season 
opener under Donovan’s coaching — anoth-er area for possible history in the making. 
But with no projected changes in the starting lineup, Donovan’s most experi-enced players will attempt to keep his 18-0 season opener record alive and well.
Florida’s three guards, center and for-
ward will face off against William & Mary’s 
two guards and three forwards. 
The countdown continues for the return 
of Chris Walker. The sophomore forward 
will sit out tonight and on Monday night 
against the University of Miami as he ﬁ  n-
ishes up his three-game suspension. Until 
then, expect Donovan to keep the lineup the same. 
“God forbid somebody gets hurt or in-
jured or there’s no bad attitudes or any-
thing,” Donovan said. “Those guys have 
been good from that standpoint. But I would envision us going the same way.”
The Tribe’s starting lineup includes se-
nior guard Marcus Thornton.
“He’s really, really good. He’ll be as 
good as any guard that we’ll play against this year,” Donovan said of Thornton.
Donovan said he’s eager to see how these 
rotations stack up against Thornton, who 
averaged 18.7 points per game and con-
tributed 599 total points in his junior sea-son, ending the year with a 40.3 percent in 
3-point percentage.
“He can really score the ball, he’s got re-
ally good size, he’s got deep range, he can 
play in pick n roll, he can play in transition,” Donovan said. “He’s a special player.”
Florida’s only returning starter, junior 
guard Michael Frazier II expects covering 
Thornton to be a true team effort, and one 
that could test Florida’s ability to execute 
such an effort.
“Can’t have one guy on the island with 
him, going to have to be a team effort,” Fra-
zier said. “Going to have to help each other 
and, like I said, communicate on defense, 
help them speed the game up a little bit and, 
you know, just do what we do.”
With no exhibitions games on its sched-
ule, tonight’s game will be William & Mary’s 
ﬁ  rst glance of its 2014-2015 team.
From what Donovan saw of his team 
against Barry on Nov. 6, he knows they 
have a long way to go to live up to the high 
expectations placed on the near-National 
Champion Gators.
“I think they can see, guys from last year, 
know what a really good defensive team 
looks like and we’re not there yet,” Dono-
van said. “The biggest from last year for me, which is great for this year’s team, is there’s a measuring stick, not in terms of leader-
ship, but in terms of defensive possessions, 
transition defense, communication, running 
offense, executing, extra pass, ball move-
ment, they have a pretty good idea what that looks like.”
Though Florida managed a 79-70 win 
against Barry, the Buccaneers managed 
more points in the paint, more points off New-look UF basketball opens season tonight

While Florida hasn’t run into any 
roadblocks on its path to a South-
eastern Conference title, a contest 
against Kentucky away from home 
could be the detour the Gators have 
been trying to avoid.
No. 15 
Kentucky 
(22-4, 11-2 
SEC) is one 
of the few SEC teams this season to have both a dominant offense and 
defense. 
In a match against Florida (20-3, 
14-0 SEC), it’ll be a test of which 
teams plays the cleanest.
At the beginning of the season, 
Florida’s biggest weakness was at-tack and service errors. Against FSU on Sept. 4, UF ﬁ  nished the match with a loss and its most errors in a 
match for the season with 46. 
After working to limit errors, 
Florida’s team has been more con-
sistent in making clean serves and 
kills. 
Florida is going into Kentucky 
with the mindset of just another 
game, but if the Wildcats get the win, it could jeopardize an almost 
perfect season.“We’re looking at it as it is a 
match unto itself,” coach Mary 
Wise said. “No matter what has happened before, what happens after it’s an opportunity to play a 
great team on their home court in 
front of what we know will be a ter-riﬁ  c crowd, and these are the really fun ones when you know all eyes — in the country — will be on this 
match and we’re embracing the op-
portunity.”
Florida’s biggest challenge in 
conference play so far was against 
Alabama, which boasts two of the 
best right side and opposite hitters in the SEC in Krystal Rivers and Kat Hutson. 
Even against the two strongest 
hitters in the SEC, Florida showed no weakness.
Against Kentucky, Florida will 
have to utilize its defense better than 
it has all season — a component to 
the UF squad which Wise continues to applaud for its success.
“They’re (Holly Pole, Maddie 
Monserez and Taylor Unroe) play-
ing like seniors…,” Wise said on 
Oct. 26. “Any given night, it can be anyone of those three, and the spe-cial nights is when it’s all three.”
Kentucky is second in the SEC with a .270 hitting clip, third in op-
ponent hitting percentage (.191) 
and ﬁ  rst in assists (13.11) and kills (14.35).
The Wildcats are the ﬁ  rst truly 
balanced team the Gators have faced since their preconference 
schedule, which included four top-
25 teams.

Alligator Writer @B_murph4
 In 2013, the Florida men’s and women’s 
cross country teams entered the NCAA Region-
al championship with an NCAA Finals berth 
tucked away in their back pocket. 
The men automatically advanced out of the 
south region with a second-place ﬁ  nish at the 
event. In addition, Florida was able to produce the men’s regional champion, Mark Parrish. 
Parrish set a personal record of 29:44.24 to 
claim the individual title in Tuscaloosa, Ala-bama. 
On the women’s side, the Gators cracked the 
top ﬁ  ve with a fourth place ﬁ  nish. While the 
women’s team did not advance, top runners 
Cory McGee and Agata Strausa earned at-large individual bids with Strausa ﬁ  nishing as an All-American.
Both of these squads will be led by fresh faces 
at Friday’s meet. For the men, only two of the seven runners competing ran at last year’s re-gional event. Sophomores Carlos Miranda and Mac Reynolds will return to NCAA’s where they 
both set personal 10K bests. The rest of the team 
will enter the South Regional with limited post-season experience.
All is not lost for Florida as today’s meet will 
be at a course that even the younger runners have seen. 
Tallahassee’s Apalachee Regional Park is a 
track that could give the team an advantage says head coach Paul Spangler.
 “Most of our athletes are from Florida and 
have had an opportunity to compete at the state championships in high school which were held at that course. Those that were here two years ago, the NCAA regionals were held there as well. 
So it is a course that is familiar with a lot of our athletes.”
 All-SEC freshman Thomas Howell won his 
high school state title at the course as well. 
Thomas has been a stalwart for the men’s 
squad, ﬁ  nishing as one of the top Gators in al-
most every meet this year. Thomas knows it’s go-ing to take an impressive performance in order to advance into the ﬁ  nal round of postseason play.
“If we’re going to do that we are going to 
need a breakthrough race. I believe we have the potential to do it, we have a lot of unproven po-tential on our team and we have every tool and opportunity to do that in the coming week.”
For the women, two true freshmen and one 
redshirt freshman will make an appearance for the team on Friday. The women will be seeking their fourth Regional championship and their 
ﬁ  rst since 2009. 
Sophomore Taylor Tubbs has shown success 
as of late, leading the way for her squad at the 
2014 SEC Championship. UF will need a big meet from Tubbs to have any chance of making 
it out of the region.
Last time the event was held in Tallahassee, 
Florida State won both the men’s and women’s 
title. 
That was two years ago, but not much has 
changed. 
The Seminoles will enter the meet as one of 
the competition’s favorites to win at home. Two of Florida’s biggest rivals ran away with last 
year’s Regional competition, as Georgia won the 
men’s side and the FSU women also claimed vic-tory in Tuscaloosa.   
Florida will have to take both teams down in 
route to a hopeful top-two ﬁ  nish. 
Without that, the Florida cross country teams 
season will come to a close 150 miles away from home in Tallahassee, Florida.Gators set to race regionals todayCROSS COUNTRYUF VolleyballOne game behind Morgan at 
40-46 is Inside the Gators’ Landon 
“A-gap rush” Watnick, who was able to do some hardcore analysis of Florida’s pass rush against Vander-
bilt on Saturday. It’s a shame that 
you can only understand what an “A-gap blitz” is after you hear the announcer mention it on TV.
Sitting pretty in a three-way tie 
for fifth place at 38-48 is 247sports.com’s Thomas “just one more bottle” Goldkamp, who was caught buying enough alcohol to please a frat party earlier in the week … but it was for himself. His response on the situa-tion: “I just like good beer.”

Rounding out the three-way in 
fifth place is Gator Country’s Nick “one-two punch” de la Torre, who spent more time breaking down why he likes UFC fighting to Edgar than Landon and Goldkamp did breaking down film this week com-bined. Damn, man. That’s just sad.
And in dead-ass-last with a 
piss-poor record of 32-46 is alliga-torSports editor Jordan “Bump, set, spike” McPherson, who opted out of this week’s alligatorSports pod-cast to cover — of all things — a vol-leyball match. Why are you putting yourself through that Jordan? When

turnovers and more second 
chance points than the Gators. Frazier said the players are aware of where they’re cur-rently falling short.
“I mean, we understand 
that there’s a lot of things to get better at and right now that’s all we’re focused on, is just getting better every day, not about the future, not worrying about the past, just staying in the moment, focus-ing on what we can control,” Frazier said.
Something Frazier and the 
other individuals on the ros-ter can’t quite control or fully grasp is who will emerge as Florida’s leader. 
It seems the question of 
leadership is an inescapable theme that’ll continue to plague the 2014-15 Gators.
“I learned a really, really valuable lesson several years ago when I tried to force it down Erving Walker’s throat that he needed to lead our team,” Donovan said. 
“And I did it and did it 
and did it and did it and did it. It got to a point where he couldn’t handle it. He just didn’t feel like he was capa-ble of doing what I wanted him to do.”
With that lesson learned, 
Donovan is making a con-scious effort not to push a leadership role onto any player at this point in the sea-son because he said he’s un-sure if any player is capable of handling that responsibil-ity right now.
“I would rather have our 
players play well and have me lead than have guys try to lead and not play well be-cause they have too many re-sponsibilities,” he said.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2014

After losing leading playmaker Jaterra 
Bonds last season to graduation, seemingly no-
body is counting on the Florida Gators wom-en’s basketball team to contend this year. 
“Preseason rankings came out, and we 
were nowhere to be found,” freshman Brooke Copeland said. “It’s just another thing to moti-vate us going into the season.”
“Kentucky is ranked … and we beat them 
twice last year. We didn’t even get a vote, it’s just so disrespectful.”
The campaign to prove everybody wrong 
begins today at 3:15 p.m., when the Gators take on Jacksonville in the O’Connell Center. 
The Gators return six players from a team that 
lost to Penn State in the second round of last year’s NCAA tournament. With a consider-able amount of added depth and height, the Gators are ready to put last season behind them and focus on the task at hand. 
“There’s certainly no replacing Jaterra,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “You’ve seen a lot of people elevate their games, elevate their 
personalities, elevate their leadership, because 
they know that there’s a void there.”
With Bonds’ absence, the Gators will look to 
redshirt senior Kayla Lewis and junior Cassie Peoples to fill some of the voids that Butler has seen the team identify. Peoples has spent the offseason improving her shot and defensive intensity to further develop a game reliant on speed to compensate for a lack of height. The 
team leader in steals last season, Peoples has 
seen the team take a renewed interest on the defensive side of the ball. 
To demonstrate its focus, the team devel-
oped an identity for their defense: Hector. 
The ensuing camp, dubbed Camp Hector, 
brought an emphasis on defensive intensity that might have been missing from previous teams. The Gators have given Hector an iden-tity, a personality even. The name was coined from the prefix “hexa,” which is also the Greek word for the number six. The Gators want their defense to stifle, smother and force the opposing team to turn the ball over. The team wants opponents to think there’s a sixth Gator on the court playing defense. 
“Hector, she’s actually a girl,” junior An-
toinette Bannister said. “She looks mean, she’s tough, she’s cut, has wild hair.”
Camp Hector began before preseason prac-
tice, and before the sun came up. For three 
days before the start of training camp, strength 
and conditioning coordinator Tyler Stuart gathered the team at 5 a.m., putting the play-ers through a grueling regimen focused on im-proving their defensive skills and mentality. 
There was no basketball, there were no 
shooting drills. 
Only a team putting in extra work to im-
prove a defense that finished second-to-last 
behind Ole Miss in the Southeastern Confer-
ence in scoring defense last year, giving up 70.5 points a game. 
Furthermore, the Gators finished last in the 
SEC in defending the three-point line, allow-ing opponents to shoot 32.9 percent from long range against them. 
A height issue for the Gators resulted in the 
team often being outrebounded, and giving 
the opposing team extra possessions. 
Florida gave up an average of 40.1 rebounds 
per game last season while only pulling down 
an average of 36.1 rebounds per game. With Lewis being the tallest Gator last season at 6-foot, Florida believes it has solved the height issue, as it has added post-playing freshmen Haley Lorenzen and Copeland. Coupled with the return of 6-foot-4 redshirt junior Vikto-
rija Dimaite, the Gators are hoping they’re the 
team out-rebounding its opponent. 
Dimaite, set to finally make her collegiate 
debut after having her career derailed by nu-merous injuries, hopes the height brings a new dimension to the team. 
The Gators will have an early chance to 
exploit a team in the post, as they face a Jack-sonville team whose tallest player is a 6-foot-2 
sophomore.
“I feel like we can block shots, be big on of-fense and defense,” Dimaite said. “We all can 
shoot and play good post defense, and that’s definitely an advantage for us.”
If you combine the lack of roster depth, lack 
of height and lackadaisical defense, it’s hard to 
see how the Gators made the NCAA Tourna-
ment last year. The players don’t look at it that 
way — they only see how far they can go this year, after exceeding expectations with less last year. 
“Having more people, and having more 
height, we’re at an advantage because nobody knows what we have,” Bannister said. “We have people who can guard in the post and now we won’t be at a disadvantage.”
With the season upon them, the Gators are 
hoping to let their play do the talking. Butler 
hopes the team owns the image they created 
in Hector, and continues to place a high level 
of emphasis on the defensive end.  
“They created that image, that presence, 
that persona, and that gives them a great deal of ownership of how we’re going to play on that end of the court,” Butler said.UF set to open season today
