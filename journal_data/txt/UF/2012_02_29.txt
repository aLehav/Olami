A ﬁ  re at Satchel’s Pizza on Tuesday night forced the 
evacuation of 25 customers and could keep the restau-
rant closed for up to six weeks.
The cause of the ﬁ  re is unknown, but Gainesville Fire 
Rescue Chief Gene Prince said 20 ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters and seven emergency vehicles responded after receiving a call at 
6:47 p.m. about smoke in the restaurant’s kitchen. No-body was hurt.
Fireﬁ  ghters cut holes in the roof of the building to 
make sure the ﬁ  re was contained.
“In older buildings like this, with several layers of 
roofs, you can have a hidden space,” Prince said.
Fireﬁ  ghters came down from the roof after they found 
more live ﬁ  re, which they continued to ﬁ  ght from the 
ground.
They climbed back up a few minutes later, sparks ﬂ  y-
ing as they cut into the metal roof with saws.
Prince said the ﬁ  re was out by 8 p.m.
Satchel Raye, owner of Satchel’s Pizza, was eating din-
ner with his family on the outdoor patio at the restaurant 
when the general manager said he saw smoke inside.
Raye, 44, said he ran outside and saw smoke coming 
out of the back corner of the kitchen outside of the build-ing. He told the manager to cut the power to the restau-Fire closes

Student Government Senate ushered 
in change Tuesday night as senators 
unanimously approved the spring elec-tion results and replaced outgoing sena-tors.
They elected Judiciary Chairman 
Aundre Price as the new Senate presi-dent and Rules and Ethics Chairman Lo-gan Harrison as the new president pro tempore.
Price said he is UF’s ﬁ  rst black Senate 
president.
Former Senate President Andy Ma-son and former President pro tempore Jason Tiemeier both resigned from the Senate a semester early.
Mason said after the meeting that it 
was time for him to make room for new representatives. He said he plans to stay involved with SG.
Both ofﬁ  cers 
thanked their peers and encouraged them 
to put in the necessary 
effort and take away a 
good experience.

Club XS will close its doors for the last time 
Thursday , but the spot will reopen after the 
break under a new name.
Managers will replace XS with a new club 
over Spring Break to jump-start business. The 
new club, Envy, will open March 14.
Rick Rosenbluth, 21, general manager of 
Gator City Sports Grille and Club XS, said the 
club’s bartenders and drink specials won’t change.
“We want to come up with a brand-new, 
fresh face,” he said.  “It’s going to be a much nicer atmosphere.”
Rosenbluth, a Jewish studies and family , 
youth and community sciences major,  said al-though the club was doing well, it didn’t have the name recognition he hoped for. XS opened Jan. 1, 2003.
Fans of the club can spend one ﬁ  nal night 
partying at tonight’s farewell event with $95 VIP bottles and free drinks for women.
Once the doors close, Rosenbluth said, the 
real work will begin.
Painters, contractors and lighting specialists 
will transform the space into Envy over Spring Break. 
Changes to the venue will include a new 
color scheme, new tops for the bar, a new DJ booth and new lighting.
“It’s not XS 2.0,” he said. “It’s a brand-new, XS to be replaced by new 
nightclub over Spring Break

Lauren Poe stood 5 feet in 
front of a projection screen. He 
had one arm around his wife and 
wore a blank expression as they 
waited for the screen to show the last of the election results.
“It’s like watching the ball 
drop on New Year’s Eve,” one of Poe’s supporters shouted as on-lookers waited in silence.
The screen flashed. Poe won.The future member of the 
Gainesville City Commission embraced his wife and told the 20 people in the room to “exhale.”
The race was finally over.
Lauren Poe was elected to the 
at-large 1 seat of the Commission Tuesday night with 5,713 votes 
— 56.64 percent of the total vot-ers. His opponent, Nathan Skop, received 4,374 votes — 43.36 per -
cent.
Poe is a Santa Fe College as-
sociate professor and a former District 2 Gainesville City Com-missioner. Last spring, he lost his 
seat in a runoff with Todd Chase, 
a Gainesville businessman.
Skop is a lawyer and a former 
commissioner on the Florida Pub-lic Service Commission.
Regular elections on Jan. 31 
ended with none of the at-large 1 candidates receiving a majority of the votes, so the race went to 
a runoff.
A total of 10,087 people vot-
ed in the runoff election out of 
72,176 registered voters. In Janu-ary, 12,213 people voted for the citywide seat. Fewer people typi-
cally vote in runoffs than in regu-
lar elections, said Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
Poe said he is ecstatic to take 
his seat on the commission on 
May 17.
“We only make decisions as a 
body,” Poe said. “It’ll be impor -
tant for me to communicate what it is I can add to the discussion 
and listen carefully to what they bring as well.”Poe and Skop have been neck-
and-neck throughout the runoff. 
Each raised about $20,000 for 
their campaigns since Jan. 27.
Skop said he was proud of the 
clean, issues-based campaign he ran. He said he wouldn’t have 
run his campaign differently. He 
and about 20 of his supporters sat at high-top tables in Gator’s Dockside and watched the vote 
tallies come in on an iPad.
“It is what it is,” Skop said. 
“We are very proud of the fact that we elevated issues to the atten-
tion of the citizens of Gainesville. People are struggling to pay their 
bills and make ends meet, and we 
brought attention to that.”
Although he did not rule out 
participation in another election, 
Skop said he did not have plans 
to run in another race. As he dis-cussed his plans, “Don’t Stop Believin’” played over the speak-ers.
Poe, who will continue to 
teach at Santa Fe College, will get about three months off before he begins his term on the commis-sion. In the meantime, he said he 
plans to get acquainted with the 
city staff and finish chores around the house.
“My wife has left me a few 
honey-do lists that I haven’t got-ten around to checking off,” Poe said. “Now, I finally can.”

Kristin Giannas was trying to do any-
thing but draw attention to herself.
She failed.
Giannas was copying papers in a 
WUFT office in Weimer Hall when she 
saw a bright light. She looked up, stared forward for three seconds and dipped out 
of view. Then she stood back up. Then she 
looked around. Then she dropped to the floor. Then she peeked around the copy machine.
Her will-she, won’t-she antics unfolded 
in the background of a WUFT newscast about four years ago. Until Thursday, the evidence was just a fun video to show around the newsroom. But “Awkward 
Kristin” inexplicably went viral last week, 
and as of Tuesday night the 30-second clip had 1.9 million views on YouTube.
Giannas, 23, doesn’t know the exact 
date she was caught lurking in the back-ground, but she remembers feeling groggy. She spent hours editing a story and was in a zone, unable to focus on anything but her work.
When she walked into the office, Gian-
nas knew they were broadcasting, but she thought she was out of sight. Then she looked around and read people’s reac-
tions.
“My legs wouldn’t move,” said Gian-
nas, who graduated from UF in 2010 with a telecommunication degree. “I was just paralyzed with fear. I didn’t know what to 
do, so I exited elevator-style. I could have also done the stairs. I’m pretty good at do-ing the stairs.”
One of Giannas’ 
friends, Andi Babineau, uploaded the video to YouTube in November 2010, about two years af-
ter the incident actually 
occurred. Giannas, who 
has worked for WCJB TV20 since graduating, 
showed it to friends at the office.
They liked it, she said, but nothing 
more came of it. The video still had about 400 views Thursday morning.  
Then, around noon Thursday, someone 
posted a link to the social news website 
Reddit. Giannas doesn’t know who post-
ed it, but by 12:50 p.m. the video already had 10,782 views, according to one com-menter.
“Awkward Kristin” was played on 
“Good Morning America” and “Ander -
son Cooper 360” on Friday, and it has only grown in popularity. Giannas said she likes the attention she is receiving and 
said the video represents just who she is: 
“Awkward Kristin.”
Two days before the video went viral, 
Giannas filed a report about a racist video posted online by a pair of Gainesville High 
students.
Her lead for the story: “It is amazing 
what one YouTube video can do.”

City Commissionbetter club.”
Rosenbluth said the VIP section 
will be redone with new uphol-
stery , mirrors, flooring and tables that will feature a glowing ice 
bucket for VIP bottles.
UF student James Martingano, 18, said he enjoyed going to XS but 
agreed it needed a change.
“It really could use some reno-
vation,” the health science fresh-man said. “It is a good club and it’s a lot of fun. I guess it didn’t re-ally come across that way to some people.”
Other students are skeptical that 
changes to the club will make a no-ticeable difference.
Bianca Miller, 21, said she 
doubts Envy will provide a club experience like those in Miami.
“I don’t expect to be blown 
away because the renovations are taking less than two weeks,” the animal science senior said. “But I’m definitely curious to see what they have to offer.”
affiliated with the Unite Party 
identified Tiemeier as the man in a Unite Party shirt who threw away hundreds of copies of the Alligator during election cam-paigning.
In an interview, he said Sen-
ate officers hold their positions 
for one semester, and it’s rare to 
stay on to serve only as a sena-tor.
He said he didn’t want to run 
for Senate president.
“There’s no real reason why,” 
he said.
Supervisor of Elections Toni 
Megna also spoke before the elec-tion results were approved. She said the Election Commission will be meeting one more time to decide if they want to make any minor election changes, such as altering language on the ballots.
Before the new senators were 
sworn in, outgoing senators and remaining veterans gave advice 
to the younger set.
“The more you put in [to 
Senate], the more you’ll get out 
of it,” said budget Chairwoman Christina Bonarrigo.
Mason spoke about the loss 
of mentors in the SG office this semester. However, he said he 
knows the future of the Senate is 
bright.
He encouraged all the new senators to make a difference on campus.
“Compromise isn’t always a 
bad thing,” he said.
Diversity — both racial and 
political — were the themes of the night.
Former Allocations Chairman 
Joe Pardo echoed Mason.
“It’s a priceless opportunity 
to learn how to deal with people 
you might not get along with,” 
he said.
Student Body President-elect 
Tj Villamil also spoke about be-
ing the first Hispanic Student Body president elected.
“I could not be more proud to 
represent diversity on this cam-pus,” he said.
Former Students Party presi-
dential candidate Alex Cornillie also urged senators not to let par -
tisan politics get in the way of the ideas on both parties’ platforms.
“I think there is a lot more 
common ground than discord between the two parties,” Cor -
nillie said.
Villamil and Cornillie an-
nounced they had met earlier Tuesday . They both said they were happy with voter turnout. A record 10,644 ballots were cast in the election.
“We really want to stress that 
we are all Gators,” Villamil said.

Five-year-olds are all over UF’s 
campus today, but they’re hard to 
recognize.
They’re not wearing light-up 
sneakers or fighting over Legos — 
they’re in lecture halls taking mid-
terms.
That’s because these 5-year-olds 
are celebrating their chronological 20th birthdays. They’re leaplings: people who were born on Feb. 29.
Finance sophomore Vijay Patel 
usually celebrates his birthday on Feb. 28 or March 1 — whichever 
day is closer to the weekend.
Every four years, he gets a true 
birthday.
“Psychologically, it’s different 
from everybody else,” Patel said. “Every other birthday is just like every other day to me.”
But he said he’s excited when 
Feb. 29 comes around.
Patel realized his birthday was 
different when he turned 12. A 
teacher mentioned the oddity, and he looked up what it meant.
“Unique is the only word to de-
scribe it,” Patel said.
Today is electrical engineering 
sophomore Adam Rozenberg’s birthday, too.
He said his birthday isn’t a 
big deal, but he’ll celebrate with friends, board games and Nintendo 64.
“When I was little, it used to 
bother me because I always wanted to be older,” Rozenberg said. “Now it’s like whatever.”
But being a leapling isn’t always 
easy.
In 2010, he tried to buy a lighter 
on Feb. 28, and the store clerk didn’t think he was 18 since his birthday 
wasn’t technically for another day.
Some of Rozenberg’s friends 
forget his birthday because it’s not 
a specific day each year.
Both leaplings said they like 
being different. Rozenberg said his rare birthday can’t take all the credit, though.
“I mean, I’m cool for other rea-
sons,” he joked.

Students planning to leave early for Spring Break 
should be wary of possible traffic on Interstate 75 Wednes-
day night.
Several lanes on I-75 will close at 8 p.m. Wednesday 
as crews repair damages done to the road after a series of 
fatal crashes on Jan. 29, according to a Florida Department 
of Transportation release.
If drivers want to avoid the southbound construction, they can use U.S. 441 to get onto I-75 in Micanopy.
Two southbound lanes about five miles south of 
Gainesville will be closed while about 400 feet of roadway is replaced, the release stated. One lane will stay open.
Crews will also resurface two northbound lanes, leav-
ing one lane open.
The speed limit will be reduced to 60 mph during the 
repairs.
Repairs should be complete by 6 a.m. Thursday, ac-
cording to the release.
The Florida Department of Transportation hired An-
derson Columbia Company of Lake City to make the re-pairs for $69,000, the release stated.

Raye called 911, then grabbed a hose and started spray-
ing the building with water.
The cause of the fire was unknown at press time, but 
Raye said, “It was something in the attic. It wasn’t any of 
our equipment.”
Wade McMullen, who works at Satchel’s, was inside 
the restaurant when he saw light smoke coming from the kitchen, he said.
Employees got customers out of the restaurant “quietly 
and calmly,” he said, and firefighters and police arrived about three minutes after they were called.
Satchel’s patrons and concerned pizza lovers gathered 
on the perimeter of the parking lot, watching as firefight-ers sprayed the building.
The smoke dissipated by 7:30 p.m., but the smell of 
burned cheese and melted plastic lingered.
Raye said a brand-new air conditioning unit, which had 
been in the kitchen for one day, was destroyed. The roof 
was damaged, and the restaurant was flooded.
“The kitchen is shot,” he said, because water and debris 
were everywhere.
Raye guessed it will take six weeks to clean up and re-
open Satchel’s.

Short stacks go a long way
Chefs Anthony Rannazzisi and Jeff “The Heart of the City” Rivers keep up with the high order demand that 
comes on National Pancake Day on Wednesday afternoon at IHOP. National Pancake Day started in 2006 and works in cooperation with the Children’s Miracle Network. Patrons were given a short stack of butter -
milk pancakes and were asked to donate to Children’s Miracle Network instead of paying for the food. The Gainesville location gave away about 1,500 stacks last year and hoped to serve about 1,800 this year.

UF is among the best universities in the na-
tion for post-graduation payoff.
The university is ranked No. 3 in a recent 
study that measured the return on tuition in-
vestment of 50 U.S. universities.
Surveyed schools, including Yale Universi-
ty and Harvard University , were ranked based on their calculated return, called the Payback Score, in a 2011 SmartMoney magazine list.
Georgia Institute of Technology ranked 
No. 1, and University of Texas, Austin, ranked No. 2.
“It’s not surprising,” said Heather White, 
director of the UF Career Resource Center. “It’s confirming what is already known: UF 
students are successful.”
With the help of PayScale, a Seattle-based 
compensation data company , SmartMoney 
determined the rankings by focusing on re-cent college graduates who had been out of school for an average of two years and mid-career alumni who had been out of school for an average of 15 years.
The company used the data to figure out 
whether the money the graduates spent for college was paying off, according to an article published in “Colleges That Help Grads Get Top Salaries” magazine.
The median salary in each group was 
divided by tuition and fees, averaged and converted into the Payback ratio, the article stated. The survey used the tuition rates that the graduates paid at the time they were in college.
However, according to the SmartMoney 
magazine article, the score excludes certain 
factors that could increase the value of an edu-
cation and does not take into account increases in financial aid.
Linguistics junior Ariel Marin, 21, said UF 
is a great value, especially because of Bright Futures.“I have so many friends that are putting 
themselves into ridiculous amounts of debt,” she said. “Speaking from my perspective, I didn’t have to pay for my undergrad, so it’s really amazing that I’ll be graduating in such a great position.”
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the low 
cost of tuition played a role in how UF was ranked.
He said tuition is about $5,700 a year for 
a full-time in-state undergraduate student. He said the national average tuition is $8,200 a year.
“You are graduating with much less debt 
at a cost of attendance that is low in compari-son, and you are getting an excellent educa-tion in the bargain,” he said.
UF considered third in nation for post-graduation payoff

Graduating seniors have 
two days to order their caps 
and gowns for spring gradua-
tion.
Friday is the deadline to or -
der graduation regalia from the UF Bookstore. Seniors can rent online through Gator 1 Central, 
according to the service’s web-
site.
Caps and gowns cost about 
$40 to rent. A $5 late fee is ap-plied for each day the cap and gown are kept after 5 p.m. May 
7. The maximum fee is $25.
Before students can com-
plete the order, they must enter height and weight information. 
They will also be able to indi-cate how to pronounce their 
names if they want.
Students who order after 
Friday will have to pay a $10 late fee. The fee will increase to 
$15 starting April 20.
Caps and gowns will be 
available for pickup beginning April 23. Seniors may have someone else pick the rega-
lia up for them as long as that 
person has the senior’s Gator 1 Card.
Graduate students are re-
quired to wear a hood, but they can choose to purchase or rent 
it.
Students who want to grad-
uate at the end of the semester but have not registered can fill 
out a late degree application on the registrar’s website.
Graduations will take place 
from April 27 to May 6.

Leap years could become a thing of the 
past if a new calendar proposed by Johns 
Hopkins University professors is adopted.
Astrophysicist Richard Henry and applied 
economist Steve Hanke proposed their calen-dar in the January edition of “Globe Asia.” It takes government approval to change which calendar a country uses, Hanke said.
In the proposed calendar, there would be 
364 days a year. To account for the extra days, there would be an extra week in December every five or six years.
Rosey Arcebido, a 22-year-old UF Japa-
nese-language senior, said the new calendar would take some time to adjust to.
“It would probably throw me off, but I 
would get used to it,” she said.
She said the leap year confuses her any-
way.
“I know there’s a reason why it’s there, but I don’t understand it,” she said.
The two Johns Hopkins professors also 
proposed abolishing time zones and adopt-ing Universal Time, under which it would be the same time everywhere.
“This is a change of a pretty big magni-
tude,” said Ron Kirsch, executive director of the Leadership Development Institute. “My guess is that people are not going to like it.”
He said it could take years for a country 
to adjust to a new calendar. He said the new calendar sounded strange, but it could be ad-opted if most of a country’s population felt it would work better.
“You’re always going to have people 
who resist,” he said. “They need to make the changes as user-friendly as possible.”Professors propose calendar 
that would eliminate leap year

Former Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio will 
be in Gainesville on Wednesday to give 
a public lecture titled “Straightforward: Becoming an Effective Leader.”
The lecture, which is free to the pub-
lic, will be at 3 p.m. at Oak Hammock at UF, 4620 SW 25th Blvd.
Iorio, the second female mayor of 
Tampa, held office from 2003 to 2011.
After stepping down as mayor due 
to term limits, Iorio has focused her time on becoming a speaker and author.
Shelby Taylor, the digital commu-
nications director at the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, which is co-
sponsoring the event, said the lecture is 
geared toward anyone who has an inter -
est in public leadership. Iorio will detail lessons she learned while holding office.
Taylor said the lecture will draw from 
Iorio’s book, “StraightForward: Ways to Live and Lead.”
David Colburn, the executive di-
rector of the Reubin O’D Askew Insti-
tute on Politics and 
Society , which is organizing and co-sponsoring the event, 
said he believes Iorio 
is the most progres-sive and thoughtful mayor Florida has ever seen.
Colburn said Io-
rio will speak of successes and failures. While mayor, Iorio failed to get a plan approved to persuade commuters to stop using vehicles and start using pub-
lic transportation.Former Tampa mayor to give

First Amendment    
protects religious satire
In last year’s Mechanicsburg, Pa., Halloween parade, two 
members of The Atheists of Central Pennsylvania walked in 
the parade dressed as a zombie pope and a zombie Muham-
mad.
Around the neck of Ernie Perce, the zombie Muhammad, 
was a sign identifying him as the undead prophet of Islam. In 
a YouTube video, filmed from the perspective of Perce, viewers 
can faintly make out what sounds like an altercation.
The angry observer was a Muslim man who was offended 
by this depiction of Muhammad. Perce told WHTM the man 
“grabbed me, choked me from the back and spun me around to try to get my sign off that was wrapped around my neck.”
After Perce walked a few blocks, he found Sgt. Brian Curtis 
and reported the harassment. Curtis agreed that Talaag Elbay-
omy, the Muslim man, “was wrong in confronting” Perce, and 
charged Elbayomy with harassment.
A few days ago, the case was brought before District Judge 
Mark Martin, who threw out the charge for lack of evidence.
While the video indicates that an altercation occurred, it 
would be hard to determine the nature of the conflict from the dark and shaky video. Convictions should be based on evidence, indicating beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime occurred, 
there is arguably nothing wrong with the ruling.
However, what was unacceptable was the lecture the judge 
gave Perce, the plaintiff, regarding the limitations of the First 
Amendment on free speech.
The judge explained how, while in the military , he spent time 
in “predominantly Muslim” countries. Nothing in the Quran 
says that Muhammad rose from the dead, he said.
So because the atheist was not 100 percent factual in his de-
piction of Muhammad, this form of expression should not be considered free speech? If that is the case, then the implication 
that satire is not a protected form of speech represents a gross 
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
The judge went on to say that Perce’s costume made him 
“look like a doofus.” By this statement, the judge implies that atheists should not be able to make fun of other religions if oth-
ers are offended by their views.
To top it off, the judge rambled about how, in Muslim coun-
tries, these actions would be punishable by death. What in the 
hell does this have to do with the laws in our country? Why is 
this relevant to bring up in this case?
He went on to imply that, by offending the prophet Muham-
mad, Perce violates the rights of Muslims. 
Martin said, “We’re so concerned about our own rights, we 
don’t care about other people’s rights.”
Where in the Bill of Rights does it say that we have a right to 
NOT be offended?
This ruling is a serious affront to free speech and the First 
Amendment.Voter coersion not responsible for Unite win
While every UF Student Government election 
I’ve witnessed has been tinged with disgrace and folly, the last election was more embar -
rassing than I was prepared for, and its inordinate con-troversy deserves comment.
During the election, our campus was permeated with 
accounts of the Unite Party’s corruption. The Unite Par -
ty even received public criticism from sorority mem-bers, who are known to make up its base.
When the election finished, it seemed that everyone 
was to blame for the Unite Party’s win — except the Students Party.
In a letter to the editor Monday following their loss, 
Students Party candidates Alex Cornillie and Jesse Schmitt seemed to blame the about 40,000 UF students who chose to abstain from voting rather than acknowl-
edge that its platform and campaign was not strong 
enough to mobilize those students to the polls.
The Unite Party wins every year because its cam-
paign is strong enough to do just that: mobilize enough of its supporters to the polls. Its platform is not so bad 
as to cause enough students to vote against it.
The Unite Party is not corrupt, at least not relative to, 
shall we say, “real” politics. In fact, the future opposing 
party can learn a lot about campaigning from the Unite 
Party.
The Unite Party has strong support from a solid base, 
namely sororities and fraternities. This is how politics 
work: Because of the strength of its support, its base turns out in high numbers to the polls.
The Students Party, on the contrary, was not so much 
for something as it was against the Unite Party.
In his closing statement at the Student Government 
debate, Cornillie said, “Our party stands for something 
very important: fairness,” before commenting on the 
purported consensus of corruption and ineffectiveness of Student Government.It seemed its entire campaign 
was focused on the antagonism of the Unite Party, directly or 
indirectly.
But having policies that sup-
port a minority base — in this 
case, sorority and fraternity 
members — is not corrupt. Nor 
is it corrupt to have practices to 
ensure the minority base votes for you.
I won’t argue against the Student Government be-
ing ineffective, but there was nothing to suggest that the 
Students Party would be less so.
I do not affiliate with or support the Unite Party. 
I know as well as anyone that the Villamil video was 
embarrassing to watch, perhaps even torturous; I know 
that probably every single vote the Unite Party received 
came from a fraternity or sorority member; I know they also played antagonistic politics, even making the Alli-gator an enemy, despite its reporters and editors always striving for the highest journalistic integrity.
But all that politics is just that: politics. None of it is 
inherently wrong or worthy of vilification. If anything, it’s a gentle introduction to what the candidates will face if they enter real politics.
From the past election we learn one thing: If another 
party wants to win big in future elections, its campaign will have to change from being anti-Unite to being for something.
And that something has to be promising and worthy 
enough to mobilize students to the polls.
Until then, the few students who care about UF poli-
tics can continue complaining and maligning the Unite Party while it laughs to the polls.

We are about halfway through the Republican primary, 
which ends in late June.
By now, the stereotypes of every candidate are 
cemented. Mitt Romney is the pseudo-conservative opportun-ist. Rick Santorum is the manic Puritanical traditionalist. Newt 
Gingrich is the amoral pit-ﬁ  ghter and Ron Paul is the crazed 
libertarian.
Frankly, I am rather weary of the process. I have grown sick 
of the sensationalism. I have grown sick of the “debates” that serve as nothing more than chances for candidates to spew talking points.
Most of all, I have grown sick of the pandering and obvious 
desire of every candidate to climb to the top, no matter what.
My sentiments on the matter are no doubt shared by oth-
ers, whether they lie on the right or the left. As the presiden-tial campaign season grows longer every four years, one is inclined to ask the question: Is this the democracy intended by our founders?
It is taken for granted that every candidate craves presi-
dency. They ﬁ  ght ceaselessly among themselves, striving con-stantly to win America’s hearts and minds.
I cannot help but think of Cincinnatus, one of the ﬁ  rst re-
luctant leaders. An aristocratic farmer, Cincinnatus was called 
by the Roman Senate in 458 B.C. to become dictator and lead 
Rome’s armies against rival tribes. Sixteen days after defeat-ing Rome’s enemies in battle, he retired and returned to his farm.
While this story may seem remote, America had its own 
Cincinnatus: George Washington. After the Revolutionary War, political elites begged Washington to become king. He declined, and after the ratiﬁ  cation of the Constitution, he ran 
for president. While he could have 
ruled in perpetuity, he chose not to and 
retired after two terms. This set a prec-edent for later American presidents.
As Americans, we should long 
for this sort of leader — one who de-sires the presidency not for personal achievement, but out of a sense of duty. As I scan the current ﬁ  eld, such a candidate is not present.
Romney is the consummate career-
ist, leveraging his time at Bain Capital into political position-ing. Gingrich and Santorum are both career politicians. Ron Paul, with his ideological consistency, perhaps ﬁ  ts the bill most closely . However, he has been running for president for the past 20 years.
Barack Obama has been campaigning his entire political 
career, spending a few cursory years in the Senate before cam-paigning for presidency.
There are no doubt many reasons for this. It is within the 
genetic makeup of humanity to desire power. Individuals such as Cincinnatus and George Washington are anomalies in the narrative of history.
However, the system is also at fault. The American political 
system has shifted from an aristocratic democracy to a meri-tocratic democracy. A society based on merit rather than class has deﬁ  nite economic advantages, but it also creates a para-digm in which the individual is always motivated to move 
up the political ladder, never satisﬁ  ed, never willing to cede 
power to return to the ﬁ  elds.
We long ago shed the patrician class and retain a ﬁ  eld of 
plebeians kicking and eye-gouging in order to climb to the top.
Once again, I am reminded of an aristocratic individual, 
this time ﬁ  ctional Lord Grantham, from the television show “Downton Abbey.” When his daughter asked why he was willing to cede his estate to another, he replied, “My fortune 
is the work of others, who labored to build a great dynasty. 
Do I have the right to destroy their work or impoverish that dynasty? I am a custodian, my dear, not an owner.”
We may never again have a president who views himself or 
herself as a custodian, not an owner. But we can always hope.

Candidates should 
desire presidency out of sense of duty, not 
personal achievementColumn
Our generation faces a different path than the 
one ﬁ  rst trekked by the baby boomer gen-eration more than half a century ago. 
Our dreams and aspirations must be grounded in 
the anemic employment market of our nation, often 
characterized by stagnant wages.
Personally, I can only consider neurology and its 
related clinical ﬁ  elds to be of interest. 
Any student or researcher would be intimidated 
to study the most complex, and often unquantiﬁ  -
able, organ: the human brain. But it provides a gold mine of research and exploration.
Neurology will undoubtedly gain progress in its 
interconnected nature in nearly all scientiﬁ  c ﬁ  elds, 
the steady increase in the diagnosis of neurological 
illnesses and its nearly unlimited research poten-tial.
While this notion is contentious, the human 
brain is the greatest gift of the body bestowed upon our kind. 
It maintains and controls an array of vital func-
tions, including consciousness, hormones, emo-tions, coordination, vision, language, sexual drives, 
temperature regulation, and so on.
We still know an insufﬁ  cient amount about our 
brains despite more than a century of innovations. 
What is the full extent of drug use on brain plas-
ticity? 
To what extent does the biology of the brain con-
trol and inﬂ  uence behavior? 
All aspects of our lives are largely controlled by 
about three pounds of gray-and-white matter.
The human brain controls a signiﬁ  cant amount 
of vital functions. 
With highly specialized medicine from basic 
ﬁ  elds, neurology has a large degree of individual pursuits and combinations.
In the ﬁ  eld of neurogenetics, inherited disorders 
of the nervous system remain the forefront of re-
search. 
From cerebellar degeneration to Huntington’s 
disease or spastic ataxia, these illnesses require two dynamic specialties.
One ﬁ  eld that encompasses many specialties is 
psychoneuroimmunology. It combines the nervous 
system’s psychological processes and the immune 
system. 
We quickly realize that this study encompasses 
molecular biology, endocrinology, infectious dis-eases, rheumatology, etc. Neurology is a central in-
ﬂ  uence in all of these ﬁ  elds, and our dedication to con-
tinued research and study 
touches dozens of special-ties.
A troubling trend born from well-developed na-
tions is the prevalence of neurological ailments. 
According to the Alzheimer’s Association in May 
2010, “Medicare costs for people with Alzheimer’s [disease] will increase more than 600 percent be-tween 2010 and 2050 —from $88 billion to $627 bil-
lion.” 
This ﬁ  gure is slightly below the requested dis-
cretionary spending for the U.S. government for the 
2012 budget.
A chronic shortage of physicians in the United 
States only exacerbates the importance of neurol-ogy. 
According to the American Academy of Neurol-
ogy, “eight out of 10 disorders in the three highest 
disability classes are neurological problems.”
The costs of health care can only grow exponen-
tially, and moving forward with expanding neurol-
ogy is a major force in containing costs and suffer-
ers of these diseases.
At our monthly AMSA meeting in December, 
I had the pleasure of meeting and observing the 
works of Dr. Kelly Foote, a gifted neurosurgeon at the UF Center for Movement Disorders and Neu-
rorestoration.
He astounded the crowd with his team’s work in 
deep brain stimulation. Through the use of surgical-
ly implanted brain pacemakers, electrical impulses 
can provide therapeutic treatments for chronic pain, 
tremors, dystonia and Parkinson’s disease.   
This column is too brief and cursory to crack the 
surface of how much an investment in neurology is needed to address a medical prognosis that shows 
higher incidences of neurological ailments.
It is my belief that a primary medical achieve-
ment that will deﬁ  ne the 21st century will be a map 
of the entire human brain for every gene and neu-
ron, along with advances in neurology.
It is too substantial and critical not to concentrate 
on neurology. Every major issue of the 21st century 
will depend to a certain extent on our ability to un-derstand our mind.

State Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, left, looks at the vote tally board on the ﬂ  oor 
of the Senate at the Capitol in Richmond, Va., on Tuesday. 
� THE LEGISLATION PASSED 21-19.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
RICHMOND, Va. — Virginia’s Senate has 
passed legislation that would require women 
seeking abortions to undergo noninvasive ultra-sounds.
The chamber, narrowly controlled by Republi-
cans, split 21-19 — mostly along party lines — in approving the amended measure Tuesday.
The bill returns to Virginia’s House for expect-
ed concurrence on amendments added last week that would eliminate mandatory invasive vaginal ultrasounds and would exempt victims of rape and incest who reported the crimes to police.
Senators on Tuesday rejected several amend-ments that would have made the procedure op-tional. By the end of the hour-long ﬂ  oor debate, tempers ﬂ  ared.
Republicans said the intent of the bill was to 
ensure that women become fully informed about the gestational age of their fetuses as they make up 
their minds whether to abort them. Seven states 
have laws mandating some form of pre-abortion ultrasound exam.
Female Democrats criticized Republicans and 
Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican who broke several tie votes in favor of his party in rejecting amendments that would have blunted the mea-sure.
“The arrogance of this body in telling women 
what to do with their bodies,” Sen. L. Louise Lu-cas of Portsmouth said, thrusting her ﬁ  nger to-ward the Republican side of the chamber.Virginia Senate passes mandate 
requiring pre-abortion ultrasound
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Leaders of the Republican-controlled 
House and Senate cleared the way for formal budget nego-
tiations on Tuesday only hours after it appeared the process was bogged down over differences on allocations for higher education.
The short-lived standoff came when the Senate refused a 
House offer to cut $200 million in annual spending on higher education, a “deal killer” that might have delayed the Legis-lature in meeting its March 9 adjournment.
But the fencing ended quickly with a mid-afternoon joint 
statement from Senate President Mike Haridopolos, R-Merritt Island, and House Speaker Dean Cannon, R-Winter Park.
“We were able to produce budget allocations that ad-
dress a more than $1 billion shortfall, increase Pre-K 12 edu-
cation funding by more than $1 billion and set aside ample 
reserves,” Cannon said.
The Senate passed a budget of nearly $71 billion on Feb. 15, two weeks after a $69.2 billion budget passed in the House.
The House budget is about $1.6 billion less because the 
Senate wants budget control over two local expressway au-thorities. 
The Senate budget, which totals nearly 
$70.8 billion, boosts funding for road-building while establishing cuts for sub-stance abuse programs. Both target thou-sands of state workers’ jobs. The House budget would raise the cost of college and cut health care programs while the Sen-
ate’s proposal cuts spending on hospitals, 
and limits emergency room visits for poor 
patients.
The differences will be worked out by the budget confer-
ees that were to be named later Tuesday.
This week’s drama came in the form of a disagreement 
over a one-time, $400 million sweep of university reserves. The parties settled for $300 million, but the House wanted a recurring $200 million reduction.
“That’s a deal killer for us” said Senate budget negotiator 
JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, said. “It’s hard enough to ask for some of the excess cash back.”
The Senate preferred to plug any shortage with money 
from the universities’ reserves, or savings account.
The Senate said it would prefer to return in a special ses-
sion to resolve budget issues before giving way on higher education cuts.
“We made an accommodation to them on health and hu-
man services, we would expect the same accommodation,” 
Haridopolos said. “[The House] clearly understand where 
we stand.”
And it appeared they did as agreement came only a cou-
ple hours later.
Legislators now have seven days left to bridge their differ-
ences and ﬁ  nish on time. State law requires the ﬁ  nal version of the budget to be on lawmakers’ desks 72 hours before a ﬁ  nal vote.State lawmakers avoid meltdown; reach deal on budget

Hunter receives award
Florida freshman Kytra Hunter won the 
Southeastern Conference Gymnast of the Week honor, the league announced Tuesday.Wuerffel up for honor
One of three Heisman Trophy winners in Florida’s history, quarterback Danny Wuerffel is among the 76 players on the ballot for this year’s College Football Hall of Fame class. If chosen, Wuerffel would become the 10th Gator inducted. Top-ranked singles player Allie Will and the UF women’s tennis team is looking for its 99th straight home win today against FSU. See story, page 15.  
  Kevin O’Sullivan knew he was get-
ting a natural hitter when he re-cruited Preston Tucker, but he 
never thought he would get this much in return.
  “We knew he was going to be a good 
hitter; he’s always hit,” O’Sullivan said 
Saturday after Tucker broke Florida’s ca-
reer RBI record. “But to be able to do what he did, I didn’t predict this.”
  In fact, no one really predicted it.  Coming out of Tampa Plant High, 
Tucker was rated the 345th-best pros-pect in the class of 2008 by Perfect Game. When the 2008 MLB First-Year Player Draft rolled around, there were 50 rounds 
of selections, two supplementary rounds 
and 1,504 players picked. 
  Tucker wasn’t one of them.  That makes what he has done at Flori-
da, and what he is in the process of doing, even more impressive.
  Through his 
junior year, Tuck-er was already among Florida’s all-time best play-
ers at the plate 
— Brad Wilker-son, Matt LaPorta, Mark Ellis and Da-
vid Eckstein. But 
when the slugger turned down a contract 
from the Colorado Rockies, who drafted him in the 16th round last June with the 498th overall pick, Tucker all but assured 
he would establish himself as the best hit-
ter in school history, ahead of those four Florida greats, all of whom have had solid Major League careers.
  By the time his senior campaign ends, 
Tucker will claim several of the Gators’ all-time offensive records. He already broke Wilkerson’s RBI total of 214, and will set that bar closer to 300 by year’s 
end. After averaging more than 85 hits 
during his ﬁ  rst three seasons, Tucker is 51 shy of passing Ellis for the top spot and seven doubles from eclipsing Ellis’ mark 
of 61.
  Tucker’s on an absurd tear to start the 
season, leading the Gators in hits (12), 
RBI (eight), home runs (ﬁ  ve) and slugging percentage (.935). Three of his last four  Tucker ranks 
among UF’s 
all-time greatsTHE TOM GREEN SHOW

SEE TOM, PAGE 14� THE COMMODORES WON 77-67.
  JOHN BOOTHE
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 The Gators came into Nashville, Tenn., 
knowing the senior-laden Commodores 
were starving for an emotional lift in their ﬁ  nal home game of the season.
  It had been nearly two years since any 
of Vanderbilt’s six seniors tasted success against Florida, their most recent attempt an eight-point defeat in early February. 
  Just two minutes after the tip at Memo-
rial Gym, the Commodores had already expressed their urgency on the court.
  Three Vanderbilt seniors — Jeffery 
Taylor, Festus Ezeli and Lance Goul-bourne — scored the ﬁ  rst seven points of 
the game and helped hold Florida with-
out a bucket for the opening 2:50.  Almost eight minutes later, the Commodores’ ad-vantage had swollen to 14-5.   
  “They’re going to make runs,” UF 
freshman Brad Beal said. “Coach (Billy) Donovan said that. You just have to stay composed, because they’re going to have their runs. But we’re going to have our 
runs as well like we did.”    
  While No. 16 Florida (22-8, 10-5 South-
eastern Conference) received an inspired 
effort from its lone senior, Erving Walker, it could not overcome an equally impres-sive 50-percent shooting night from three by the Commodores (21-9, 10-5 SEC), who claimed a 77-67 victory Tuesday night. 
Vanderbilt shot a torrid 12 of 24 pace 
from behind the arc, and junior John Jen-kins, the SEC’s leading scorer, ﬁ  nished with a game-high 22 points on 6-for-9 
shooting on 3-pointers. 
“It’s never good to get down early 
but we battled and we got back into the 
game,” Walker said. “They just made some good plays at the end.”
  Five days before his own Senior Night 
against Kentucky this Sunday, Walker sparked an 8-0 run in the ﬁ  nal minutes of the opening half with a four-point 
play and two layups. The scoring streak 
brought the Gators within three points at halftime after they had trailed by as many as 12.
  Though Walker’s 15 points weren’t a 
team-high, Florida’s leading scorer, Brad Beal with 16 points, credited him for get-ting the Gators back into the game.  
  “Once he started doing that, it really 
gave us a lift,” Beal said. “We needed that and Erv really stepped up and he did a good job at penetrating to the hole.”    
  After Walker’s run, UF kept pace be-
fore grabbing its ﬁ  rst lead of the game at the 10:32 mark on a fast-break dunk by 
sophomore Casey Prather.
  Donovan said he was impressed with 
his team, especially following its 14-point 
loss last Saturday to lowly Georgia. After the UGA game, Donovan called out UF for missing leadership, citing poor energy level and a lack of passion.
  His tone was noticeably different Tues-day at Vanderbilt, even with the loss and another missed chance for Florida to seal the No. 2 seed in the SEC Tournament on March 8-11. 
  “I felt like they had resiliency [Tues-
day]; I felt they were going to battle and work their way back into the game,” Don-
ovan said. “That’s been my whole thing 
with Erving. All along and all the com-ments I’ve made about Erving, when he’s locked in and he’s really, really focused and playing, it charges our team up.”    
  While the Gators were manhandled and outhustled at times by the Bulldogs, who had eight steals and six blocks against Florida, the Commodores were not able to ﬁ  nd the same success, defensively.   
          “I was maybe as disappointed as I was 
as a coach walking off the ﬂ  oor in Athens, Georgia, watching our team perform,” 
Donovan said. “I felt totally opposite here 
[Tuesday]. I thought we competed. We played hard against a very, very good team.”

After complaining about effort following a loss to UGA, coach Billy Donovan said 
he was impressed with UF’s resiliency in Tuesday’s 77-67 loss at Vanderbilt.
hits have been home runs, and 
although he’s unlikely to reach LaPorta’s record of 74, Tucker 
(who sits at 46 career round-trip-
pers) will surely finish second on that list.
“He’s gone on tears like this,” 
O’Sullivan said. “You look up and it’s almost like you expect him to hit one (home run) a game.”
Since he first stepped on cam-
pus, Tucker has been in the heart 
of Florida’s lineup — 200 starts 
and counting, another record he will likely break by season’s end — punishing opposing pitchers 
with his career .587 slugging per -
centage. 
Most impressive, perhaps, 
is that Tucker will have accom-
plished these feats while playing 
the final two years of his career 
with new bats designed to have less pop. 
Now, he is on the verge of 
going from unheralded hitting prospect to the most prolific hit-ter and arguably the greatest player in Florida baseball’s 98-year history. 
He’ll be able to cement that 
designation if he helps lead the Gators to their third straight trip to Omaha, Neb., and the school’s 
first College World Series title.
“(He’s) going to go down in 
the record books as one of the best 
players to play here,” O’Sullivan said before the season. 
And no one saw it coming.Not bad for some kid from 
Tampa who went undrafted out of high school.

Florida fans may be waiting for that 
“wow” factor from the Gators, but they’re 
not alone — so is Tim Walton.
Although he has led his team to a 13-1 
record and a No. 3 ranking, Florida’s coach wants to see more excitement and energy from his players. 
“I want our team to be fun to watch, I 
want them to be exciting,” Walton said. “I want people to get excited to come watch us play and come to the ballpark. I just don’t think we’re playing to the excitement level 
that my expectations are.”
This past weekend, the Gators played in 
front of hundreds of UF fans in Palm Springs, Calif., where they won four of five games. 
All of the players and coaches, including Walton, said they were energized by the at-mosphere and made it their goal to reflect 
that enthusiasm when on the field.
The team’s proclaimed vocal leader, 
sophomore Cheyenne Coyle, agreed with 
her coach and said she looks to give the 
crowd a little more to watch starting Thurs-
day against Eastern Michigan.
“You can go to a game and not be exciting 
at all,” Coyle said. “You have to have enthu-siasm when you play. You have to make the 
good plays that people come to see. People 
go to major league stadiums to see good plays; it’s all entertainment.”
Walton went as far to say that Jeremy Lin 
has made an impact on college softball. Wal-ton wants to capture the attention of those around the nation with his team’s play, like Lin has done in the NBA.
Sophomore Hannah Rogers has some 
ideas on how her team can put on more of a show, especially in front of the packed stands of Katie Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium.
“Just as a team, be more fun to watch,” 
Rogers said. “Go out there and have a good time and little cheers in the dugout can get the crowd excited. Making hard plays that no one thinks you can make can get the team more excited and pumped up about the 
game.”
In tournaments, the Gators sometimes 
play back-to-back games against struggling 
teams, like they did in the first tournament 
of the year when they played Maine and Il-
linois State. Walton focused on his squad’s energy during those games, wanting them to perform with the same intensity as they would against ranked opponents.
This past weekend in the Cathedral City 
Classic in California, Walton was surprised with the turnout of Florida fans, who he 
said drove four or five hours just to watch 
his team play. He doesn’t want to let his fans down by giving them a boring game of soft-ball. Walton wants his players to entertain, saying that’s what they are here to do.
“I’ve told the team a couple times, I would 
not have paid to watch (them) play,” Walton said. “That’s the message I want to give my team. I want them to be fun to watch, play 
with intensity and play with excitement. 
At the end of the day, the ‘W’s take care of themselves, but more importantly the excite-ment level is what people come to see.”14, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 2012

With every point won on 
Wednesday, the Gators got some 
of their swagger back.
After being beaten down in 
consecutive matches against 
Georgia and Duke at the ITA In-door Nationals, No. 10 Florida defeated South Florida 7-0 on Tuesday, setting the stage for its Southeastern Conference opener on Friday against Tennessee.
“It was just what the doctored 
ordered to get ready for Tennes-
see,” coach Andy Jackson said. “I 
think we’re doing much better. 
We probably are a little bit rusty, 
but I thought that we hit the ball 
pretty well.”
The Bulls (1-7) gave the Gators 
a scare in doubles, as the No. 14 team of Tripper Carleton and Spencer Newman was defeated 
8-4. With the point on the line, 
Billy Federhofer and Nassim Slilam put away their opponents 8-5.
“South Florida was extremely 
sharp and hit the ball well in dou-bles. That was a big point, to get the doubles point,” Jackson said.
After that, it was all Gators. UF won all six singles points in 
straight sets, the team’s first shut-
out since defeating New Mexico 7-0 on Jan. 28. Junior Bob van Overbeek, playing at the No. 1 singles spot, said this match was a much-needed win.
“It was very important,” van 
Overbeek said. “Coach scheduled this match knowing we’d have some time off after the indoors, and he didn’t want to schedule a bad team.”
Facing Yannick Yoshizawa, 
an opponent with an unorthodox game, van Overbeek was able to continue his strong play. Most rallies did not last more than four or five shots, as Yoshizawa relied 
more on creating spin, while van 
Overbeek tried to remain aggres-
sive and offensive-minded.
“It was tough,” he said. “His 
game is not really about looking 
for offense right away. It was im-portant to make sure I was hold-ing my serve because his game is very unusual. “
Van Overbeek won his match 
6-4, 6-3, but he was the last player 
off the court Tuesday afternoon. 
Like the rest of his team, the ju-
nior will spend the next two days 
preparing for a demanding SEC 
season.
Florida begins conference play 
Friday by hosting No. 19 Tennes-see in a match that opens a stretch where the Gators will play four 
matches in 10 days, including a 
rematch against Georgia on Sun-
day. 
“It’s just brutal. They’re top 25, 
they’re off to a really good start,” 
he said. “They have a lot of young guys that are going to swing for the fences. It’s going to continue like that for 10 matches.” WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Lily Svete does not have the statistics of a 
typical 6-foot-2 forward.
Although she is the second-tallest player on 
Florida’s active roster, she ranks next to last in 
rebounding with just one per game and has re-corded only one block this season.
Svete’s statistics suffer mostly from a lack 
of playing time; she logs just 9.1 minutes per game.
However, with the Southeastern Confer -
ence Tournament looming, Svete may be on the verge of boosting the rest of her numbers thanks to her scoring.
The sophomore put up a career-high 12 
points in Sunday’s 75-59 loss at Tennessee, making 5 of 8 field goal attempts for a lagging Florida offense.
“She doesn’t get to play a lot of games as 
many minutes as she wants,” guard Jordan Jones said. “But when her name is called, she goes in there and does what we expect her to do and that’s hit shots.”
Svete is one of the Gators’ premier 3-point 
shooters. Despite her limited playing time, Svete has put up 54 attempts from beyond the arc, the third-highest mark on the team and 39.4 percent of all her shots.
“We like Lily on the floor, we really do,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “She is just an amaz-ing shooter and has such confidence when the ball hits her hands and she’s open.”
However, despite moderate success with her 
perimeter shooting, Svete’s rebounding num-bers leave something to be desired.
Her season-high tally in rebounds is just 
three.
“I think about rebounding every day,” Sve-te said. “I want to become a better rebounder. That’s one of my biggest weaknesses, just an-ticipating where the ball is going to go.”
Jennifer George, who leads Florida in re-
bounding with nine per game, sees improved 
effort from Svete crashing the boards.
George said she was especially impressed 
with Svete’s efforts boxing out Tennessee’s Glo-
ry Johnson in the paint on several possessions.
However, Jones notes that in order for Svete 
to continue to trend upward, she will need to get her defensive rebounding numbers up with Florida’s other “big girls.”
“It’s obviously an area that she still needs to 
improve on, but she’s working 
hard at it and I trust her when 
she’s out there,” Jones said.
One challenge for Svete has 
been to blend her perimeter 
shooting with aggressive play 
under the basket. Depending 
on how quickly shots go up, Svete sometimes does not get 
to the post in time to get good 
rebounding position.
“For Lily, it’s hard because a lot of times, 
she’s outside of the paint,” Jones said. “So, I 
think it’s hard for her to remember to crash and 
get in there and bang with the big girls.”
Svete expects to be able to mix the inside and 
outside aspects of her game as she continues to 
work on her all-around consistency.
“It’s a different mentality of shooting and re-
bounding because in rebounding, you have to 
be all tough and your muscles are tense,” Svete 
said. “In shooting, everything has to be relaxed. 
It’s hard to get that balance, but I’m working on it and trying to improve that.”

On May 15, 2004, the Florida 
women’s tennis team walked off 
the court, defeated at home by the 
Miami Hurricanes, 4-3. 
Nearly eight years — 2,848 
days — later, the Gators have yet 
to experience that feeling again.
In the 98 matches since Flor -
ida last lost at home, much has changed for UF. Players have come and gone, championships won and 
lost. For this year’s team, many of 
whom were just in middle school in 2004, none of that matters.
“As far as the winning streak, 
we don’t talk about it much,” ju-nior Caroline Hitimana said. “We know it’s there, and other people talk about it, but we try to focus on every match and play the best ten-
nis we can.”
Staying focused on each indi-
vidual match is something that 
has been stressed all year by Hiti-
mana, other players and coach 
Roland Thornqvist alike. That focus will be put to the test on to-day, when the Gators host No. 68 
Florida State at 5 p.m. This will be 
Florida’s final match before South-eastern Conference play opens on Friday.
As much as the players brush 
off the win streak, Hitimana and junior Allie Will both agreed that the crowd at Linder Stadium plays a big role. For Hitimana, it started 
when she was being recruited.
“I heard that the home crowd 
was really good, always pushing 
us, always supporting us, and I think that makes a really big dif-
ference,” she said.
The Gators are no strangers to 
winning in Gainesville. The team 
is 432-25 all-time at home, win-
ning a remarkable 94.5 percent of 
their individual matches. Will, the No. 1 player in the country who was in seventh grade the last time Florida at home, echoed the senti-
ment that the crowd support had a 
major impact on the team.
“Every match is exciting to win 
at home, and since we have such 
an amazing crowd, it helps us so 
much,” she said.
“I think it will be great for the 
Gator Nation, but we’ll just take it one match at a time.”Gators seeking 99th 
consecutive home win

“They have a lot of young 
guys that are going to swing 
for the fences. It’s going 
to continue like that for 10 
matches.”

 UF junior� SHE POSTED SEASON HIGHS ON BEAM 
AND BARS AGAINST UGA LAST WEEK.

After UF’s meet against LSU on Feb. 10, Marissa 
King looked bothered.
Her team posted the nation’s highest score in a 
197.85-196.85 victory, but something wasn’t right 
about King’s demeanor. 
“The whole week (before LSU), something was 
off,” King said. “I couldn’t tell you what it was.” 
Against Alabama a week earlier, King, a junior, 
found herself in a midseason funk. Coach Rhonda Faehn said she believes it began right before facing the Crimson Tide. 
“She had an absolutely terrible warm-up at Ala-
bama,” Faehn said. “It was atrocious. I was ready to pull her. She probably doesn’t know that.” 
Following the 197.725-196.900 loss to the Tide, 
King’s personal struggles only intensified. 
A usually rambunctious King was oddly quiet 
throughout a rough week of practice. Also, her old 
bad habits from elite-level competition were manifest-
ing back into her routines. 
“Everyone’s human,” King said. “You’re going to 
have emotional fluctuations. I was a little bit down on myself and I really don’t know why .” 
King admits she entered the LSU meet with the 
wrong mindset.
She lost her balance on her vault landing early, post-
ing a 9.725, but still managed to finish the day with an all-around score of 39.40 to tie for third overall. 
On her final event, floor exercise, King suffered  
stingers in both of her ankles after landing awkwardly 
on a double layout. While she tallied a season-best 9.925 against the Tigers, she was unsatisfied. 
“[My floor routine] may have looked good, but 
personally, I didn’t achieve much,” King said. “I didn’t really feel like I competed my heart out with passion.” 
The next morning, King vented her personal issues 
to her parents via Skype. A few days later, King had a one-on-one conservation with Faehn to discuss mov-ing past the difficult point in time. 
Rest also proved to be key in uplifting King’s spir -
its. At Auburn on Feb. 17, King sat out vault and floor to ease the pain in her ankles. She posted a 9.9 on un-even bars and a 9.95 on balance beam in limited ac-tion. 
“The rest was wonderful,” she said. When No. 1 Florida defeated No. 3 Georgia 197.525-
196.825 last Friday in the O’Connell Center, King appeared to be mentally and physically refreshed, screaming and supporting her teammates 
“Our team just eats it up because they feed off of 
that energy and enthusiasm,” Faehn said.
That night, King had her share of mistakes, stum-
bling on vault (9.775) and stepping out of bounds on floor (9.8). 
Still, she scored season highs of 9.95 on beam and 
9.925 on bars to win both event titles.  
After her beam dismount, a confident King held 
her pose for a couple of seconds just so the crowd and the judges could get the message.
“I was back to myself,” King said.16, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 29, 2012

King bounces back from down weekSTAFF REPORT
 
The Charleston Shootout turned out to be 
anything but.
No. 27 Florida turned in the only under-
par team score of the day (1-under, 287) and 
cruised to an easy 15-stroke victory at the 
two-day event in Hollywood, S.C., claim-
ing the team’s second tournament title of the spring season.
“It was another good, solid day out there for us,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “We’re very happy to get the win on a course that played much harder (Tuesday).”
While the other 13 teams in the tourna-
ment struggled to break par on the event’s second day, the Gators maintained their lead on the field thanks to a 1-under 71 from ju-
nior Tyler McCumber and a 2-under 70 from 
freshman Eric Banks.
McCumber eagled the par-5 fifth hole on 
his final round before carding two bogeys on the back nine and closing with a birdie on 18.  Banks led the Gators with a five-birdie effort against three bogeys in the final round.
Although Banks and McCumber led Flor -
ida in the third round, junior T.J. Vogel wasn’t far behind, shooting an even-par 72 to 
complete the tournament at 
10-under and finish first individually, one 
stroke ahead of defending tournament cham-pion Jacobo Paston of Charleston Southern.“T.J.’s win was awesome,” Alexander 
said. “He’s been incredibly good for us and I don’t see why it has to stop. He’s incredibly consistent and just has a drive to get better every time out.”
The win was the second individual title of 
the season for Vogel, who also captured the 
win at last month’s Sea Best Invitational.
