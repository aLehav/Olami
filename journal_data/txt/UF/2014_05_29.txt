UF will begin the gradual process of switch-
ing from Sakai to the new course management 
system Canvas this summer.     
UF Information Technology announced 
last week that the transition is scheduled to be complete by Summer 2016. 
However, UF may be sacriﬁ  cing a few 
things in the switch, said Douglas Johnson, the assistant director for learning services at UFIT.   
Students who were annoyed with the 
Sakai’s two separate grading tabs can breathe easy, Canvas will only have one. But because Sakai is open-source software and Canvas is not entirely open-source, UF will have to go through the course management company to ﬁ  x any bugs. The company can choose to make these changes based on its business needs.     
“This is a huge experiment to see what 
Canvas brings out,” Johnson said, “but many people are convinced the beneﬁ  ts of Canvas will outweigh the beneﬁ  ts of Sakai.”
Bahar Pourshariati, a 21-year-old recent 
UF psychology alumna, said that it’s tough to know if Canvas will be better than Sakai.    
“They are constantly trying to improve 
their technology and stay on top of the trends,” Pourshariati said, “but newer isn’t always bet-ter. UF Information Technology to fully replace Sakai with CanvasHANNAH FELL and

After 86 years of poetry and civil resis-
tance, Maya Angelou died Wednesday 
morning in her home, leaving UF students appreciative of their opportunity to hear her speak last year. 
Angelou was best known for her  1969 poem, “I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,” which recounts her upbringing as an African-American woman in the Ameri-can South during the Jim Crow era. 
UF students and professors reacted to 
the news of her death Wednesday by re-membering her work, as well as her visit to campus, when students packed the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts in 2013 to hear her speak. 
“Her presence was just so incredible,” said 22-year-old UF psychology alumna Somi Aggarwal, who attended the perfor-mance hosted by UF Accent Speaker’s Bu-reau last year. 
Angelou spoke frankly about her past 
and her passion for civil and human rights. She ended by reading honest and uncen-sored poetry, Aggarwal said. 
“The way that she carries herself and 
spreads her story is really inspirational,” she said. “When she talked, like, you just felt it. Everyone was so drawn in.”

RecSports will be busier than ever in the 
coming year, thanks to an extra $100,000 al-
location from UF’s Student Senate.
This money will bring UF students 15 
more group exercise classes a week, with ﬁ  ve in the morning, ﬁ  ve in “prime time” and ﬁ  ve classes devoted to cycling.
For gym rats who hate waiting, RecS-
ports will now staff the previously closed O’Connell center weight room.
The new weight room will also come 
equipped with ﬁ  nger scanners to ensure that only authorized users can pump iron, said UF Student Senator Davis Bean, chair of the budget and allocations committee. 
With the additional funding, RecSports 
can now open basketball courts on the weekends, according to a letter from David Bowles, director of RecSports.
Club volleyball will also move to the 
Florida Gym on weekdays, and a ﬁ  tness co-ordinator position will be added, he wrote. 
“You always hear the Southwest Rec 
is crowded, that student rec is crowded,” Bean said. “Hopefully this will lessen wait times.” 
Additionally, some of the funds will go 
toward RecSports’ club sports, which al-lows the organization to remove the current sports club cap, Bean said.
This extra funding comes from a rise in 
the student Activity and Service fee that is built into credit hour prices. The 5-percent raise in fees, an additional 84 cents that begins Summer B, was instituted by UF’s Board of Trustees in January, according to Alligator archives.RecSports

She was taken to Alice Town Clinic in Bimini, where she was pronounced dead.The circumstances of the ac-cident are under investiga-tion, and an autopsy was planned for later this week, said Inspector Jeff Adderley. No arrests have been made.The accident occurred off Bimini, a small cluster of is-lands about 50 miles east of Florida.

Rose oil is a key ingredient in luxury per-fumes.Lissicharov said prices are likely to be lower this year because of the high yield.

“She was so powerful for such a tiny 
person,” she said.
Justin Dunnavant, a 25-year-old UF 
anthropology graduate student, said he has read multiple letters written by Angelou. She often wrote by herself in a hotel room, he said, because she believed that unique ideas could only come to those who spent time alone. 
“She could do things gracefully and 
artistically with paper and pen,” Dun-navant said. UF history professor Paul Ortiz said 
it is hard to sum up the life of a person who did so much good. 
Angelou worked with many promi-
nent ﬁ  gures of the civil rights era, in-cluding Malcolm X, Richard Wright and James Baldwin, he said. She was like their interpreter. 
“She was one of the last people who 
could tell you what they were thinking,” he said. “She was able to get at the per-sonal psyche of African-American soci-ety.”
Ortiz said he often uses her memoirs 
and interviews in his classroom. Her powerful work pushes people beyond their comfort zones, he said. 4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2014

The City of Gainesville’s commu-
nications entered the 21st century 
last week with a new online forum called engageGNV.
Tacked on to cityofganesville.
org, this forum will allow citizens to comment on selected topics the city posts for discussion and vote on op-tions for city projects. These projects are given a time limit for discussion, and the results are compiled and sent to the City Commission.
EngageGNV is part two of 
Gainesville’s Gov. 2.0 Initiative, which seeks to improve access on the city’s data and communication.     The city signed a 1-year, $9,000 con-tract with Peak Democracy, a public engagement company, to provide this forum service, said Lila Stewart, the senior strategic planner for the City of Gainesville.
Launched May 21, engageGNV 
has one topic up for discussion, and more than 90 people have submitted their opinions to the website — the equivalent to nearly ﬁ  ve hours of public discourse. The current topic up for discussion is the renovation of Southeast Fourth Street from De-pot Avenue to Southeast Williston Road, which is scheduled to take place over summer of 2015. Citizens can voice their opinions, ranging from right-of-way width to how much the city should spend for the project, until June 18. The comments will then be shared by staff mem-bers at the June 19 City Commission meeting. 
Gainesville Public Works storm-water engineer Andrew Roberts, who suggested the .7-mile project be a part of the engageGNV launch, said the forum will be a great way for him to collect citizen input.
“It’s only been up for a week or 
so, and we’ve already got input,” said Roberts, who is heading the rebuilding project. “Internet forums are a little easier for people to at-tend.”

The bill, SB 2014 10-37, was approved 
unanimously during Tuesday night’s senate 
meeting. The legislation explained how UF’s Student Senate divided the $18,735,300 raised from the student A & S Fee. 
Other major changes include an about 
$80,000 increase in Student Government staff salaries. Bean attributes this to minimum wage increases, state-mandated 3-percent salary in-creases and the creation of a new professional marketing position to be shared by SG and stu-dent activities and involvement. The position has been in the works for years, he said. 
“Now we have a formal position to get the 
word out about these services that are some-times underused,” Bean said.
The academic budget for groups dipped al-
most $75,000 to better ﬁ  t how the organization was spending their budget, he said.
“It’s just like what we’re doing with Ac-
cent,” Bean said. “They weren’t using all their money, they were hovering right around that $450,000 rate, so we just bumped them down to that.”
Accent lost about $46,000, only about half as 
much as the Reitz Equipment Fee, which went from $96,400 to zero.
These cuts, Bean said, went toward staving 
off more drastic measures, like the earlier com-mittee consideration to cut gym hours. Instead, SG asked that the Reitz reuse and repair older equipment. 
Sen. Anthony Sorrentino spoke in favor of 
the bill, especially the increases for student sal-aries on campus.
“The more that we can employ students, the 
better,” he said. “That’s something I like to see in the midst of this construction.”BUDGET , from page 1THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Gainesville Police arrested 
a local woman carrying a bag 
of meth and seven oxycodone pills after she tried to destroy 0.2 grams of crack cocaine in her pants. 
Officers arrested 32-year-old 
Juanita Bass on charges of tam-pering with evidence, posses-sion of cocaine, possession of a controlled substance without a prescription and possession of marijuana, according to a police report.GPD stopped a car early 
Wednesday morning with Bass in the front passenger seat. As the officer approached, the smell of weed wafted from the car, ac-cording to the report. 
The officer then searched Bass 
and felt an object wedged in her crotch, according to the report. The officer allowed Bass to get the item but noticed she started to move the object inside her pants. Bass then pulled out an Elmer’s Glue tube containing co-caine residue. 
The officer continued to search 
Bass’ pants and found several large pieces of a rock-like sub-stance, according to the report.   
The officer recovered two 
crack rocks, weighing about 0.2 grams, after they fell out of the bottom of Bass’ pant leg, as well as oxycodone pills in her purse.
The officer also noticed Bass 
clenching a plastic bag contain-ing a yellowish substance, which was later found to be 1 gram of meth, according to the report.
After questioning, Bass said 
the meth and cocaine was not hers, according to the report.
Officers booked Bass into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 2:30 a.m. As of press time, her bond is set at $50,000.

UF has chosen the head of 
its new Online Learning Insti-
tute. 
Carole Beal, who will also 
serve as a professor of Educa-tion Technology, is leaving the University of Arizona to lead the new education re-search program this August. 
This institute is different 
from UF Online. This program is funded by the university’s grant money and includes the colleges of education, engi-neering, journalism and com-munications, and fine arts. 
“These colleges will hire 
faculty that are experienced in those fields to pursue re-search that will benefit UF Online and the rest of the university,” said Andrew McCollough, a UF associate provost. 
In addition to Beal’s ap-
pointment as head of the On-line Learning Institute, she will also be a professor of education technology with a salary of $140,000.
“It was sudden,” she said. 
“But having the opportunity to work with groups on cam-pus and lead the online learn-ing program was something I couldn’t pass up.”
Beal currently works at 
the University of Arizona in the School of Information Re-sources and Library Science as a professor of science, tech-nology and the arts. She will start at UF on Aug. 16 in the College of Education’s School of Teaching and Learning.
McCollough said having 
Beal as the head of UF Online Learning Institute is a step toward UF’s goal of becom-ing a top 10 public research institute.
This institute will allow 
UF to explore adaptive learn-ing, such as combining differ-ent fields like arts and tech-nology, he said. 
Pavlo Antonenko, assis-
tant professor in the College of Education, said Beal would be a good addition to the four-department program.
“The hope is that she will 
have competence and exper-tise,” he said. “She will be more of a coordinator as op-posed to a primary research-er.”
She said she’s most look-
ing forward to spotting UF’s scaly mascot in the wild.
“They drove me around 
campus and said, ‘Watch out for the alligators!’” she said. “I didn’t know if they were being serious.”Online Learning

The battle between the press and the Obama adminis-tration to release the 41-page memo ordering a drone strike on Yemen in 2010, which resulted in the Sep-
tember 2011 targeted killing of an American citizen who was accused of plotting terrorist attacks, rages on this week. The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union has been pressuring the administration for years to disclose the memo to the public, as per the Freedom of Information Act. Though the Obama administration claimed they had com-plied with a federal appeals court ordering the disclosure of portions of the memo, The New York Times reported yester-day that the administration is appealing to censor additional parts of the memo. 
This tug-of-war between the press and the president is 
keeping the media from performing its watchdog function. For going back on its word and attempting to keep impor-tant documents out of the hands of journalists, we’re tossing a that’s-not-how-you-democracy DART at the Obama admin-

Ugh, what a gross attitude. The members of the royal fami-

Rodger’s video?Today’s question: Do you prefer Canvas over Sakai?Prepare for a worst-case climate scenario 
When a meteorologist warns Floridians of an im-
pending hurricane and the catastrophic damage that could result from such a storm, most people 
heed the warnings and batten down the hatches. Recently, scientists discovered that a massive ice sheet in Antarctica melted past the point of return, and in the coming decades could seriously threaten coastal cities, especially those in Florida. 
Many will scream that it’s a conspiracy perpetuated by 
the left in order to force more government into our lives. Others will shrug at the news as they sip a cool drink in Mi-ami Beach, enjoying the waves crashing into shore. Never mind the increased ﬂ  ooding that’s already plaguing parts of Miami, or the point-blank warnings that cities such as Miami will cease to exist if the oceans rise as expected. 
Florida Sen. Marco Rubio doubts the existence of global 
warming, claiming that temperatures on earth have stabi-lized. The popular political fact-checking group PolitiFact rated Rubio’s claim “mostly false,” yet that ranking will probably do little to change Rubio’s rhetoric. As a son of south Florida, how could a man vying for the White House ignore what could very well be the deﬁ  ning humanitarian and planetary crisis of the 21st century? 
Sure, you could write off that previous sentence as left-
ist hyperbole — and there’s no doubt many of you will — but when 97 percent of scientists agree that the world is changing for the worse, perhaps we should not cry con-spiracy so soon. 
Maybe our lack of belief in global warming has some-
thing to do with the enormous challenge it is to actually prevent the catastrophic consequences we face. The small changes are starting with severe droughts devastating the western U.S., leading to sizable increases in food prices and the terrifying report that some in Texas are resorting to drinking from the toilet, because water is so scarce.
Rubio and others can ignore or placate their base in 
order to win an election, but what kind of country does Rubio want to lead? One that let its cities drown and farm-land turn to desert, or one that admits we have a serious problem and takes action?
The U.S. used to be a country 
that set goals and took action. We built the Panama Canal, defeated fascism in Europe, won the Cold War and remain the only nation on Earth that put men on the moon.  Hell, now we can’t even get into space without hitching a ride from our former Cold War 
adversaries, the Russians. 
It’s time we stopped screwing around, kicking dirt, 
waiting for the next generation to take action, and it’s well past time for politicians — our supposed leaders — to ig-nore the warnings, unless Marco Rubio wants to visit his grandchildren in this century’s Lost City of Atlantis: Mi-ami Beach. 
Defeating climate change is not something that the gov-
ernment can accomplish on its own. Instead, it takes all of us admitting that there’s a problem and that we need to do something before it’s too late. Cutting back on our energy consumption, driving less and pressuring our leaders to act are just some of the ways we can try to prevent a cata-clysmic shift on earth. 
If we listen to the meteorologist — a scientist — before 
a hurricane hits, let’s listen to the scientists about climate change. It just might save our lives and the lives of future generations, along with humanity.  Sometimes the meteo-rologists are wrong about the hurricanes, and we boarded up our houses and evacuated for nothing, but we are bet-ter to be prepared than dead. 
Best case, the scientists are wrong, and at least we’ll 
be living on a cleaner planet that understands the symbi-otic relationship we have with the Earth and all the living things gracing our big. blue marble in space. Worst case, we’ll be prepared for whatever comes our way.

Our legislature is attacking women’s 
rights in Florida. House Bill 1047/Senate 
Bill 918, which vaguely claims to revise circumstances under which a pregnancy in the third trimester may be terminated, permits doctors to place the potential life of a fetus above the life of a woman.  
This bill reduces women to walking 
incubators and lays bare the Florida Leg-islature’s belief that a woman’s true value is in her ability to birth and raise children.  With HB 1047/ SB 918, the legislature asserts license to con-trol women’s reproductive decisions about when or if we have a child. Gov. Rick Scott has a choice: He can either side with the legislators who strip women of control over our bodies, or he can stand with the powerful constituency of women voters in Florida and veto the bill.
The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that even 
when states prohibit third-trimester abortions, there must be an exception when a woman’s life or health is in danger. Florida’s new law prohibits doctors from considering whether the mental health and well-being of a woman seeking such an abortion is in danger.  
The law also permits doctors to prioritize the 
health of the fetus over that of the pregnant mother. This bill is not about “protecting” anyone.  Only the woman can truly know her situation or circumstanc-es; therefore, the decision needs to be made by the woman and her medical provider without restric-tions. The legislature is attempting to force labor on women but is not passing laws that would sup-port the mother and child once he or she is born.  If the legislature is really concerned about Florida’s children, it should focus on pro-viding access to health care, public edu-cation and creating options for affordable child care. Instead they choose to focus on taking away a woman’s right to self-determination.
This bill will increase the already high 
barrier to a woman accessing a third-tri-mester abortion by prohibiting abortions 
once a fetus is viable — when it can survive outside of a woman’s body. Focusing on the potential fetus rather than the woman who carries it is anti-woman. Narrowing the window of time a woman can seek an abortion is just another move to weaken Roe v. Wade. This focus creates a questionable time period and will erode women’s rights even further with fu-ture changes in medical technology. 
We will not stand by silently and allow yet an-
other obstacle to be placed between women and our right to medical care.  We demand self-determination for all women and girls, which includes the ability to terminate a pregnancy that we don’t want.  
If Scott ignores Florida women now and does 
not veto this bill, he will face the anger of women across the state and at the ballot box as he attempts re-election.  Scott needs to hear from you. Call and email him to demand he vetoes HB 1047/ SB 918.  To ﬁ  nd out more or to get involved contact us at nwl@womensliberation.org or 352-575-0495.

Florida women seek governor’s vetoGuest column
Urban Outﬁ  tters recently 
added “Totes Ridiction-ary” to the stack of fun-
ny books in its stores. This book offers a scope of the modern English language and where it seems to be heading. While the book  intended to be humorous, it is shockingly accurate.
This shortening of words 
derives from the increasing use of social media and character limits such as the well-noted 140 character limit of Twitter. What also seems to be chang-ing the landscape of the English language is the way we speak.
When abbreviated words 
and new deﬁ  nitions work their way into popular media — such as Twitter,  books and television shows — their usage becomes widespread.
“If enough people use a 
word in a particular way and it becomes widespread, it will ﬁ  nd its way into the diction-ary,” said Fiona MacPherson, the senior Oxford English Dic-tionary editor.There’s no doubt that peo-
ple will disagree with current trends becoming more main-stream, but because of the glo-balization of technology and social trends, new words will come into play as the public sees ﬁ  t.
I believe we’re the front-run-
ners of a new wave of words that will become the latest ad-dition to the English language. It’s remarkable how something that seems small can turn into a movement requiring the accep-tance of a new word or phrase. English is just another example of how quickly and viral what people say and feel can be glo-balized and reach audiences across the world.

Memorial Day weekend marked 
Sunset Music Festival’s third inva-
sion of the North Lot of the Ray-mond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. 
Held over two days and orga-
nized by Disco Donnie Presents, Sunset Events and Committee Events, Sunset hosted a diverse lineup, immaculate production and efficient organization.
The student community, nota-
bly the Gator Nation, had a strong showing among the festival’s esti-mated 45,000 guests. 
Students championed the uni-
versity by holding flags and totems above the crowds and performed the Chomp when encountering fel-low Gators. 
Bridget Wlosek, a 21-year-old 
UF environmental engineering se-nior, commended the connection she felt to her fellow students.
 “I saw lots of hats and shirts 
with gators on them, my friend even brought his UF banner” she said. 
“Overall, I saw more UF stu-
dents than any other students” she said.
Connor Ward, a 20-year-old UF 
computer science junior, praised the positive vibes felt among the at-tendees.
“It’s a chance to dress up ridicu-lously, meet new people and bond with old friends in ways we never could in the real world,” he said. 
Sharing the love with new and 
old friends is easy at festivals like Sunset thanks to “kandi.” 
Kandi are the colorful wrist-
bands decorated with praises de-signed to be traded among fellow festival-goers. 
“Trading kandi with someone 
really is a meaningful experience,” he said. 
“It makes it so easy to walk up to 
random people and instantly have a connection.”
The performers, thrilled to be 
playing the largest EDM event in Florida since Miami Music Week (which includes Ultra Music Fes-tival) in late March, appropriately tuned their sets to appease the ev-er-present hunger for high-energy sets.     
“I haven’t been back to Florida 
since Miami Music Week in March but it’s amazing to be back” said prolific producer and DJ Deorro, who announced his planned retire-ment before the festival. “This is my first time playing in 
Tampa but the Florida crowds are always so full of energy and really show their love for the artists.” 
The bigger festival this year fea-
tured new additions: a cool-down maze adorned with psychedelic artwork, cooling stations equipped with fans and sprinklers and gates and walls that expedited traffic flow and alleviated sound bleed across stages.The start of the second day was 
unfortunately delayed due to a se-vere thunderstorm. 
Despite the brief bout of wind 
and rain, festivalgoers emerged from their shelters at the Raymond James Stadium to virtually no dam-ages. Festival organizers shaved some time from all performers’ sets in order to give all of the artists proper sets.
While the festival largely suc-
ceeded in achieving its lofty ambi-tions, some areas could still use im-provement. There were only four water sta-
tions across the grounds and placed next to the field facing the main stage. Lines quickly grew to stag-gering lengths and caused massive traffic build-ups.
As the central Florida music 
scene grows, festivals such as Sun-set will naturally expand to satisfy the growing demand for live mu-sic. 
If Sunset continues its streak, ex-
pect Tampa to soon be home to one of the largest festivals in the coun-try.

I went into “X-Men: Days of Future 
Past” with high hopes. After a string of 
disappointing superhero movies – the lat-est Spider-Man, “Captain America: Win-ter Soldier,” the last stupid Thor — I was ready to get back to the glory days of the Batman trilogy. 
I thought that this film had the best 
chance to revive that awesome combina-tion of amazing action, intelligence and emotional impact that Nolan brought to Gotham. After all, 2011’s X-Men: First Class was great and unique among su-perhero movies in that we got an origin story without pretension and clichéd char-acter development. So those were my ex-pectations heading into the theater. They weren’t met.
“X-Men: Days of Future Past” is a good 
movie, but not a great one. I wasn’t re-minded of Batman. In fact, I would say the most apt movie comparison would be 2012’s “The Avengers.” 
It was a film where a lot of superheroes 
got together and had some fights, showed off their powers and developed as charac-ters or displayed very little intelligence. Any fans of that first Marvel blockbuster buddy movie will likely find no objection with this one. 
X-Men aficionados will also probably 
enjoy the film — if just for the sake of some more obscure comic mutants making an appearance.
Wolverine goes back in time in order to motivate the younger ver-sions of Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Magne-to (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) to change the course of events in his-
tory. 
Hugh Jackman’s Wolverine is trans-
ported through the power of the mutant Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page). Apparently he’s the only one who can make the journey to the past due to his healing powers, which will let him heal his mind after the long journey through time. 
Thus comes the excuse to make Hugh 
Jackman’s Wolverine the star of the film. How convenient! Of course, the real rea-son is that the X-Men franchise has spent three main films and two spinoffs building Jackman up as the main protagonist. Ac-cording to the law of the superhero movie he must be the star of this one as well.
Days of Future Past is based on a 1980s 
comic arc where Kitty Pryde, from a dysto-pian future where mutants are hunted and killed, transfers her consciousness back to her 1970s body to change an event that would trigger the mass fear of mutants.  Page has proven herself to be a sympa-thetic and engaging lead (“Inception,” “Juno”). A film starring Page would have been original, showing off a complex fe-male superhero at a time when the genre is dominated by white, male heroes. It would be fresh, unique and probably powerful.
I wish that were the movie that had 
been made.

“Le Week-End,” playing at the 
Hippodrome State Theatre until 
June 5, is a small marvel of a ﬁ  lm. Though it deals with a subject that (on the surface) is hard for college students to relate to — the boredom that grows in a long relationship — “Le Week-End” is still full of small, often devastat-ing truths about the human con-dition we can all relate to.
This is the story of Meg and 
Nick Burrows — a couple cel-ebrating their anniversary in the city of love. Meg (Lindsay Dun-can) is impulsive and seeks ad-venture and excitement, while her husband, Nick (Jim Broadbent), is fussy and anxious. The opening scene of her pointedly reading a book, while he frets over where the maps and euros are, perfectly describes their marriage. 
Her ultimate goal in Paris is 
great food, excellent wine and a spark of romance: His is to ﬁ  nd time to discuss retiling their bath-room. 
Director Roger Michell (“Not-
ting Hill”) does an admirable job of not letting the Burrows become caricatures. 
I have seen all too often a 
movie make its leads one-dimen-sional — in less talented hands, Nick could have been pathetic and Meg cruel. But these two are never less than nuanced, complex human beings. 
Meg publicly accuses Nick of being too clingy yet panics like a small child when she wakes and cannot ﬁ  nd him. He seems complacent but 
admits to considering starting ev-erything over. The ﬁ  lm acurately depicts a long-term relationship, familiar to anyone who has par-ents or grandparents who have been together for a long time — often barbed and insufferable but never unloving. 
Their relationship is summed 
up brilliantly about halfway through the ﬁ  lm, when Meg tells Nick, “You make blood boil more than anybody else.” 
“The sign of a deep connec-tion,” is his reply. 
Even at the climax of the ﬁ  lm, 
when Meg is considering leaving with another man, the audience knows it won’t really happen. They are too devoted to each oth-er. She just wants to make him say it.
“Le Week-End,” though main-
ly drama, can also be very witty, and the main source of amuse-ment is their sex life (or lack of it). 
“Your vagina has been some-
thing of a closed book for 20 years now,” Nick tells Meg after getting a dismissive “What for?” when he asks if he can touch her. 
He suggests taking their love-
making “into another dimen-sion” by pretending they’re other people, a suggestion to which she disdainfully replies, “if you stay awake.” In one of the ﬁ  lms funniest lines Meg complains — after being accused of adultery — “What a waste, to be accused of being a whore and to be so in-nocent.”
Each of the ﬁ  lm’s leads has 
received some award for acting, and they richly deserve it. The ﬁ  lm would be much less without their emotional vulnerability and dry wit. 
It is unusual to see a screen 
relationship so brutally honest yet intensely romantic and that has much to do with Duncan and Broadbent’s chemistry on screen. I give “Le Week-End” four stars out of ﬁ  ve.

Picture this: You and your friends are 
hanging out in the backyard, playing Fris-bee or cornhole, waiting for the hamburg-ers to grill on the barbecue.
It’s a summer evening and the sun is 
beginning to set, and the heat is subsiding. The smell of the barbecue wafts through the air and your grill-master friend hollers that the burgers are ready. You settle into a lawn chair with a cool beverage in one hand and a plate of food in the other. You reach into the potato chip bag for a perfect, salty crunch to counter the juicy meat, to-matoes, ketchup and bun. Stop a minute and look at the potato chip bag.
What does the advertising say on the 
bag? What are the descriptions? All natu-ral? Kettle cooked? Since 1955? These de-scriptions indicate more than just the kind of chip or how it is made. Rather, the ad-vertising language gives insight to one’s identity, particularly socioeconomic class and values.
You probably could guess that the lan-
guage on a Cheetos bag targets the lower class, budget conscious and perhaps col-lege students (hey, it’s cheap and cheesy), while a bag of Boulder Canyon chips or Kettle Brand appeals to the upper class. But wait, beyond the price and social class matchup, there’s more that is revealed in the advertising language on the chip bag.
A study by linguists at Stanford Uni-
versity found that more expensive chip brands use more words, more complex language, longer sentences and uncom-mon words than inexpensive chips. Com-pare “ﬂ  air,” “savory” and “culinary” on expensive chip bags with the more com-mon words “fresh,” “light,” “basic,” and “extra” on inexpensive bags.
Inexpensive: “What gives our chips 
their exceptional great taste? It’s no secret. It’s the way they’re made!”
Expensive: “We use totally natural in-
gredients, hand rake every batch, and test chips at every stage of preparation to en-sure quality and taste.”
Yet prevalent in both 
types of chips (expensive and inexpensive) is the appeal for authenticity. Americans want the real deal, but what this means depends on social class. 
Advertising language 
conveys in different ways how a chip bag is authentic, ultimately hoping to convince consumers that “If you buy our chip bag, you’re buying into authenticity.”
Advertising language aimed at the up-
per class emphasizes health and natural living (all natural, sea salt, only real food ingredients, kettle cooked, totally natural and never fried). Advertising toward the working class makes references to tradi-tion and historicity with an emphasis on the company’s early founding and long histories (since 1986, an old family recipe, Bill and Sally Utz believed, classic Ameri-can snacks).
So what kind of potato chip you had 
for lunch or dinner says a lot about your identity, socioeconomic class and notion of authenticity. 
According to Adam Drewnowski, an 
epidemiologist at the University of Wash-ington, “In America, food has become the premier marker of social distinctions, that is to say—social class. It used to be cloth-ing and fashion, but no longer, now that ‘luxury’ has become affordable and avail-able to all.”
This week’s ‘the nibble’… Do you think 
chocolate bars would show similar results? Or is another value besides authenticity promoted? And in a different way?
For further reading, check out Joshua 
Freedman and Dan Jurafsky’s (2011) “Au-thenticity in America: Class Distinctions in Potato Chip Advertising” in Gastronomica 11: page 46-54.

Mac Miller, also known as 
“Easy Mac with the Cheesy 
Raps,” capitalized in his teen-age years as a party rapper with chorus-driven songs of low lyrical depth like “Nikes on my Feet” and “Donald Trump.” 
On his latest free-for-download 
effort, “Faces,” released on Mother’s Day, Miller continued his develop-ment as a musician and self-con-scious rapper, highlighted by ma-ture production and lyrical content, where he delves more into his strug-gle with drug addiction, personal re-lationships and depression.
The 24-track mixtape is like an 
introduction to the new chapter in Miller’s career, one that has him pro-ducing his own music with a wide range of sounds, from ambient jazz samples (“Here We Go,” “Rain”) to mellow, bass-heavy drums (“Polo Jeans,” “Diablo”) to church organ heavy beats (“What Do You Do,” “New Faces”).  Through all the faces Mill-er shows of himself, from boasting how cool it is to hang out with him (“Thera-py”) to revealing his heavy dependence on drugs and 
his depression (“Rain,” “New Fac-es”), Miller shows he’s in the music industry to make the music he wants and feels, a pleasure an independent artist like Miller has.
“Faces” continues the growth of 
his second studio album, “Watching Movies With the Sound Off,” where he talked about depression and his stance in the music industry as an independent artist. He also started producing his own music, which helped him stray from the party-rap sound he rose to prominence with.      
“Faces” is a long project to en-
dure at more than an hour-and-a-half long, but you are bound to ﬁ  nd a face of the 22-year-old you will enjoy looking at.

noon against Baylor, Walton has no doubt Florida can end up on top in Oklahoma City.
“We’ve established that culture 
that we want to end our season at the College World Series,” the ninth-year coach said. “This team is no different than any other.”
•   •   •
In order to reach Oklahoma City, 
Florida had to take out a hot-hitting Washington team in the Super Re-gionals.
And coming off a Seattle region-
al where they blanked their three opponents by a combined score of 26-0, the Huskies were not going down without a fight.
“I had a gut feeling this was go-
ing to go to a three-game series just by the nature of the stuff that I saw on film,” Walton said.
Florida took an easy 9-0 win 
on Saturday, needing just one win against Washington on Sunday to punch its ticket to Oklahoma City.
After Washington took the 4-3 
win in Game 2, the tiebreaker that immediately followed experienced weather delays — nearly six hours worth.
But after the rain cleared on two 
different occasions, the Gators were victorious, pulling out an 8-0 victory in five innings of work.
“I thought they really could’ve 
easily hung their heads after play-ing the first game well and just get-ting beat,” Walton said. “At the end of the day I believe we left no doubt that we deserve to move on to the College World Series.”
•   •   •
Fresh off the first rain delay in 
the winner-take-all match against Washington, Kelsey Stewart made a hit that symbolized her role in Florida’s offense.
Facing a 1-1 count with two 
outs in the bottom of the fourth, the sophomore struck a three-run home run to right field to give Florida a 4-0 lead right after a crack of light-ning lit up the sky.
But Stewart didn’t see the bolt 
that brightened the grey-filled sky over Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-dium. 
She didn’t need to.“I heard everybody with their 
oohs and ahhs,” she said.
Even without seeing the light-
ning crack, Stewart’s seventh home run lit up Florida’s offense just like she has done all season.
The Wichita, Kan., native leads UF in batting average (.435), doubles (14), triples (6), stolen bases (34) and multi-hit games (29) good enough for first-team All-American status.
And after making it to the Super 
Regional for the second time in her career, Stewart knew Florida wasn’t going to lie down.
“Our hype number was super 
high at that point,” Stewart said. “I knew there was no losing for my team. I knew my senior pitcher was going to go out there and wasn’t going to let us lose, and I knew all of the girls were still going to be up and fight until the end.”
•   •   •
Now that they’re one of the final 
eight teams competing in Division I softball, the Gators look to continue their success.
For Florida, that success starts in 
the pitching circle. 
And with the circle comes ace 
Hannah Rogers.
The senior has three complete-
game shutouts in her career — in-cluding two last weekend against Washington — to tie her with Stephanie Brombacher for the sec-ond-most in program history with games still to play. She is Florida’s first four-time All-American — with one first-team selection (2013), two second-team nominations (2011 and 2012) and one third-team nod (2014).
But her performance in the de-
ciding game against Washington is one that Walton will never forget.
“I could see it in her eyes when 
she was throwing the ball,” Walton said. “I saw something in Hannah (on Sunday) that I hadn’t seen in four years.”
In that final game — through the 
delays, the waiting and the pressure — Rogers struck out six batters, al-lowing just one hit and three walks. She needed just 83 pitches to get the win.
“I think it’s more just of a men-
tal game,” Rogers said. “That’s just when you really have to keep your focus and make sure that you’re not letting anything get in the way of you whenever you do have a long delay like that.”
And even with all she’s accom-
plished, Rogers has one more goal

As you walk past “Gator Mania” in the Oaks Mall, you 
take in a storefront that vomits orange and blue. But hanging 
on a mannequin in a display window is an orange shirt with a blue crab on it that has the No. 5 right in the middle, inviting you to visit ‘Jameis’ famous crab shack emporium.’”
It’s poking fun at Florida State’s two-sport athlete Jameis 
Winston, and it’s a hot seller.
“Our crabs are always at a ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nger discount,” the $18.99 
shirt reads on the back, taking a sardonic play at the FSU ath-lete’s recent shoplifting ﬁ  asco from the seafood department of a Tallahassee Publix.
20-year-old Taylor Macdonald has worked at the Oaks 
Mall Gator Mania for more than a year as a sales associate. She says people will come in to the store just because they see the shirt.
The shirt is made by Smack Apparel, a popular clothing 
line that makes colorful shirts that takes shots at many of the rivalries in college sports, and isn’t exclusive to just UF and its blood-feuds.
Macdonald is a big Gators fan who said Winston is “a 
good quarterback” but “not exactly the brightest bulb.” She says Florida State fans often come in the store and actually laugh at the shirt.“The shirt does bring in people because they see it and 
they’re ‘oh, that’s so funny,’” Macdonald said. “I mean I think it’s hilarious. I actually have the shirt.”
22-year-old Justin Burger has it too. He works the ﬂ  oor at 
the Archer Rd. Gator Mania location which features the shirt less prominently than its mall counterpart. He’s not a fan of Winston as a person but thinks it’s “outrageous” not to think he’s a great player.
Burger says his store got the shirts two days after Winston’s 
incident happened April 29, and there was shock from many shoppers at how quickly Gator Mania was able to get it.
“It’s the ﬁ  rst one where people that are FSU fans have 
come and been like ‘I disagree with that, but that’s funny,’” Burger said. “In the past we’ve gotten stuff for FSU, gotten stuff for Georgia, gotten stuff for Miami … but even FSU fans see that one and they’re like ‘OK, that’s funny.’”
So whether your quarterback is lifting crabs or your line-
backer is barking at a police dog, there will always be humor-ous cannon fodder for one side to lob jokes at toward the other.
It gives the rivalry a 365-day-a-year feel to it, and that 
can be further illustrated by what sits outside the Archer Rd. Gator Mania in the parking lot: a black Chrysler 300, with a Florida State Seminoles logo on its license plate.THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 17

� THE FIVE PLAYERS WILL ARRIVE IN 
THE FALL OF 2014.

As the season ended for Florida in a dev-
astating 12-11 loss against then-No.5 seed 
Northwestern (14-7) on May 17, the Gators are already working toward boosting their roster for 2015.
On May 19, ﬁ  ve Florida signees were 
named Under Armour All-Americans.
Under Armour All-Americans include the 
nation’s top 90 high school senior lacrosse players and are selected by a panel of lacrosse experts. The list takes about a year to put to-gether, and players are placed based on how good they are at their positions.
The players that have been selected for this 
year’s Under Armour All-American team will play in the ninth-annual Under Armour All-American Lacrosse Classic on July 12 at Tow-son University’s Johnny Unitas Stadium.
The ﬁ  ve players — Olivia Cole, CeCe 
Finney, Isabella O’Connor, Allie Pavinelli and Shayna Pirreca — will be entering Florida in the fall to begin their freshman seasons with the Gators.
Cole will be coming in, most likely, as a 
second string keeper. Sophomore Mary-Sean Wilcox will be going into her junior year at the time of Cole’s arrival and has more than proved her strengths in the cage after making a season-high 77 saves for 2014.
Finney is the only midﬁ  elder of the signees 
on the Under Armour All-American list. How-ever, Finney will be well received next season. During the 2014 season, one of the Gators big-gest issues was dealing with a depleted mid-ﬁ  eld after losing 11 seniors to graduation in 2013.
Players like juniors Nora Barry and Shan-
non Gilroy made up for the depletion on the midﬁ  eld, but coach Amanda O’Leary was constantly working to rest midﬁ  eld by relying heavily on the defense.
O’Connor, Pavinell and Pirreca are all at-
tackers. Most likely, the three players will be-come a combination of attackers and midﬁ  eld-ers since Florida has seven attackers already.If the three are used only as attackers, they 
will be facing off against some of the biggest offensive playmakers for the 2014 season, aside from Gilroy and Barry.
Some of the players include freshman 
Sammi Burgess, who had the second-highest point total for the Gators in 2014, and sopho-mores Lauren Lea, who has been instrumental around the crease on ground balls and pass-ing, and Devon Schneider, who is known for using her height to score easy points over shorter keepers.
With the loss of only two players this sea-
son — keeper Cara Canington and defender Krista Grabher — Florida won’t have as much to prove, but that won’t stop it from looking for a national title.

Eight teams remain in the hunt 
for the title as the top softball team 
in the country. Each team took dif-ferent paths to make it, but in the end, they all made it to Oklahoma City. With action beginning today, alligatorSports took a look at each opening-round matchup. 
Game 1: No. 5 seed Florida (50-12) vs. No. 13 Seed Baylor (47-14)RPI: 1 (UF) vs. 12 (BU)Batting Average: .312 (UF) vs. .305 (BU)Team ERA: 2.02 (UF) vs. 1.55 (BU)Fielding Percentage: .978 (UF) vs. .965 (BU)
Florida analysis: The Gators 
have come a long way since Tim Walton became head coach in 2006. They are competing in their sixth Women’s College World Series in seven years, but this time around, they hope to win it all.
Florida is led on offense by 
sophomore Kelsey Stewart and ju-nior Lauren Haeger, while everyone who’s stepped into the batter’s box this season has at least a .303 on base percentage. In the circle, UF has a three-headed rotation, with senior Hannah Rogers, Haeger and fresh-man Delanie Gourley being able to step in the starting lineup during any given game.
Baylor analysis: After finishing 
second in the Big 12 and hosting its first NCAA Regional since 2009, Baylor had a tough draw in the Su-per Regionals — No. 4 seed Geor-gia. But the Bears made quick work of the Bulldogs, sweeping UGA on its home field by an aggregate 15-4 score.Baylor has one of the best pitch-
ers in the country in Whitney Can-ion. A sixth-year senior, Canion has a career 1.40 ERA and has fanned 1,463 batters in 1,107.1 innings.
At the plate, redshirt sophomore 
Linsey Hays paces the Bears with 13 home runs and a .643 slugging mark.
 
Game 2: No. 1 seed Oregon (54-
7-1) vs. No. 8 seed Florida State (55-7)RPI: 5 (OU) vs. 7 (FSU)Batting Average: .349 (UO) vs. .309 (FSU)Team ERA: 1.81 (UO) vs. 1.44 (FSU)Fielding Percentage: .971 (UO) vs. .968 (FSU)
Oregon analysis: The Ducks have 
one of the best hitters in the country in Courtney Ceo. The senior short-stop leads the country with a .492 clip at the plate and is 18th in the na-tion with a .532 on base percentage. In NCAA play, the Meadow Vista, Calif., native has a .611 batting aver-age with two home runs and three stolen bases.
Oregon also has a valuable arm 
in Cheridan Hawkins. The sopho-more southpaw has a 33-4 record on the year with 11 solo shutouts and 313 strikeouts in just 230 innings en route to first team All-Pac-12 and first team All-Pacific Region.
Florida State analysis: Since 
NCAA action began, FSU has a .247 batting average — the second worst clip of the eight remaining teams. The Seminoles need to see more out-put from Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year Maddie O’Brien — who is just 2 for 13 in six NCAA contests after posting a .440 batting average in the regular season.
FSU also needs Lacey Wal-
drop — the USA Softball National Player of the Year — to continue her dominance in the circle. The ju-nior pitched 39 of FSU’s 45 innings in NCAA action, allowing just nine earned runs and striking out 26 bat-ters in the process.
 
Game 3: No. 6 seed Louisiana-Lafayette (49-8-1) vs. No. 14 seed Kentucky (49-17)RPI: 6 (ULL) vs. 15 (UK)Batting Average: .307 (ULL) vs. .264 (UK)Team ERA: 2.77 (ULL) vs. 2.23 (UK)Fielding Percentage: .960 (ULL) vs. .972 (UK)
Louisiana-Lafayette analysis:  
The Ragin’ Cajuns have power throughout their lineup. In 2014, Louisiana-Lafayette has four batters with double-digit home run totals and five with at least 37 RBIs. In five NCAA contests, ULL hit nine home runs, with catcher Lexie Elkins hit-ting four of them.
In the circle, Christina Hamil-
ton takes the bulk of the load. The junior right-handed pitcher has pitched 224.1 of the Ragin’ Cajuns 400 frames, accruing a 29-2 record, a 1.53 ERA and a 2.95:1 strikeout-to-walk ratio in the process.
Kentucky analysis: UK is the 
other team that had to win on the road in the Super Regionals to clinch a berth in the Women’s College World Series, topping No. 3 seed UCLA in three games to advance. On paper, the Wildcats — with the lowest batting average and the third-worst ERA of the field — have a tough hill to climb in their first WCWS appearance.
But behind sophomore right-
handed pitcher Kelsey Nunley (29-9, 1.85 ERA, 261.1 IP, 209 H, 202 K, 87 BB) in the circle, Kentucky looks to continue its best season in program history.
 
Game 4: No. 2 seed Alabama (50-11) vs. No. 7 seed Oklahoma (50-11)RPI: 3 (UA) vs. 8 (OU)Batting Average: .320 (UA) vs. .327 (OU)Team ERA: 2.20 (UA) vs. 2.74 (OU)Fielding Percentage: .971 (UA) vs. .978 (OU)
Alabama analysis: Alabama 
looks to win its second national title in three years. To do so, the Crimson Tide will look to outfielder Haylie McCleney and pitcher Jaclyn Traina to roll over the competition.
McCleney paces ‘Bama with a 
.451 batting average — good for the 10th-best mark in the country. The Morris, Ala., sophomore also boasts the country’s fourth-best on base percentage (.567).
Traina, the Southeastern Confer-
ence Pitcher of the Year, has a 23-3 record in the circle. In NCAA play, the Naples senior boasts a 1.96 ERA, allowing seven earned runs in 25 in-nings.
Oklahoma analysis: The Sooners 
enter their ninth Women’s College World series after a decisive three-game series against 10th-seeded Tennessee in the Super Regionals. By advancing, Oklahoma looks to win its second title in as many years, and looks to its offense to carry the load.

SoFTBAllBreaking down the Women’s College World Series fieldshe wants to check off her list: 
hoisting the NCAA Champi-onship trophy at ASA Hall of Fame Stadium.
And if she plays anywhere 
close to how she did against Washington, Walton won’t be concerned.
“She was impressive. She 
just one-hit one of the best hit-ting teams in the country,” Walton said. “I think that’s overshadowed by the score, but she was dynamite.”
•   •   •
Rogers wasn’t the only Flor-
ida player whose performance may have been overshadowed during the Super Regionals.
Lauren Haeger could claim 
that title as well.
Haeger was Florida’s start-
ing pitcher during its Game 2 loss, but she still had a solid outing. The junior right-hander surrendered six hits and gave up four runs — only three of which were earned — while striking out seven batters and not drawing a walk.
But her contributions in that 
game went further than the circle. Haeger drove in two of Florida’s three runs when she belted a two-run home run — her team-leading 20th of the season and fourth since NCAA play began — that bounced off the center ﬁ  eld scoreboard.
But outside of her homer, 
the UF offense failed to pro-vide Haeger any wiggle room, with the rest of the team going 1-10 at the plate with runners in scoring position and leaving seven runners on base.
“Lauren pitched her butt 
off (in the ﬁ  rst game Sunday),” Walton said, “and we didn’t give her any help.”
Haeger is used to producing 
at the plate when she’s also in the circle.
The junior leads Florida with 
a .674 slugging mark this sea-son. However, in the 23 games where she made an appearance in the circle, that number jumps to .764. When looking at just the 15 games where she pitched at least four innings, her slugging mark soars to .843.
“When I pitch a game, I feel 
like I can help myself more,” Haeger said earlier in the sea-son. “It’s just something that I’ve always done. If you hit for yourself, you kind of feel like you can contribute both ways.”

The Gators are ready. After 
ﬁ  ghting for more than 11 hours against Washington on Sunday to reach the Women’s College World Series, Florida is pre-pared for whatever challenges will come its way in Oklahoma City.
The ﬁ  rst one is Baylor.The ﬁ  fth-seeded Gators (50-
12) square off against the No. 13 seed Bears (47-14) today at noon to begin the ﬁ  nal leg of their journey.
Baylor pulled off an upset 
to advance to its third Wom-en’s College World Series ap-pearance, sweeping No. 4 seed Georgia by a combined 15-4 in Athens, Ga.
But regardless of the oppo-
nents, regardless of the situ-ation, the Gators are ready to play in Oklahoma City — and they know they should be there.
“It is an expectation,” Wal-
ton said. “I think ultimately we’ve created that.”THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Bears ﬁ  rst in WCWSHernandez allegedly pulled trigger
felt he was being unfairly targeted.
They then went into a separate nightclub across the 
street, where Hernandez pointed out to his friend a 
group that entered 15 minutes later. He identiﬁ  ed one of the individuals as the person that had spilled a drink on him earlier. Haggan said surveillance footage proves this claim as false, as de Abreu and his group did not leave the Cure Lounge until “after 2 a.m.”
Shortly after that exchange, Hernandez and his friend 
left to go back to the parking garage where his SUV and — coincidentally — de Abreu’s BMW were both parked. Hernandez and his friend left the garage, drove around the area, then parked on a nearby street. Once parked, Hernandez allegedly popped the hood and retrieved a .38 caliber revolver he had stashed away. At “approxi-mately 2:10 a.m.,” de Abreu and the four people accom-panying him left the Cure Lounge.
At 2:17 a.m., de Abreu, Furtado and a third person 
walked to the BMW. Hernandez’s SUV drove past the parking garage, slowing down as they passed the group. Three minutes later, Hernandez’s SUV passed by again as the other two people with de Abreu waited outside the parking garage to be picked up.
As the BMW left the garage, Hernandez allegedly said 
“there they go” and followed it. He allegedly stopped at a red light, then ran through it to catch up with the BMW. When Hernandez caught up, Haggan alleges that Hernandez leaned out of his driver’s side window, said “yo, what’s up now?” followed by a racial slur, and then ﬁ  red multiple times into the car.Haggan said a witness claimed they heard a clicking 
noise after at least ﬁ  ve rounds were ﬁ  red, pointing to the fact that Hernandez kept pulling the trigger after the gun was empty. De Abreu suffered a fatal chest wound, Furtado, a fatal head wound and both died at the scene. A passenger traveling in the middle seat in the back of the car suffered an arm wound but survived.
Hernandez and his friend then drove to Hartford, 
Conn., where Hernandez searched online for news about the shooting. They arrived there at 5 a.m. and on the way, Hernandez allegedly told his friend, “I think I got one in the head and one in the chest.”
He then phoned his cousin Tonya Singleton who 
drove up from Hernandez’s hometown of Bristol, Conn. She came and switched her car for the SUV they were initially driving in.
The SUV was stored in Singleton’s garage in Bristol 
until it was found by police while searching the home on June 26, 2013. Authorities were investigating  the June 16, 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd — another case Hernan-dez is connected to.
The alleged murder weapon was found on June 21, 
2013 after inventory was taken of the items in a vehicle involved in a collision that was driven by a Bristol resi-dent with ties to Hernandez.
Hernandez will next appear in court in relation to the 
de Abreu-Furtado double-murder on June 24. HERNANDEZ , from page 16
UF has two outdoor titles already
women’s team to earning more 
than just a podium ﬁ  nish.
“I don’t really care about rank-
ings. It’s cool to see where you are at that time, but when it comes to championships or certain meets, it’s who decides to perform that day,” Brewer said.
Preaching words that come 
from coach Mike Holloway’s state of mind, Brewer has incorporated what her mentor has instilled on the entire team.
Brewer said when Holloway 
gives his team a pep-talk about rankings not meaning anything, he helps the athletes bring the pressure down and gets everyone to not worry about the ranks.
There is only one mission for 
the Gators, and that is being out-door champions.    
The three-day event beginning 
today requires the Gator athletes to ﬁ  nish in the top 12 in their re-spective events in order to proceed to Oregon for the national ﬁ  nals. 
Top-ranked Florida qualiﬁ  ed 
37 athletes (20 women, 17 men) for prelims, and one athlete (Brit-tany Harrell) has already punched a ticket for ﬁ  nals in Eugene, Ore., that begin on June 11.
UF will take multiple star ath-
letes from Arman Hall, Najee Glass, Dedric Dukes and Hugh Graham Jr., to throwers like Kyle Starwn on the men’s side. 
For the women, mid-distance runners like Cory McGee, Agata Strausa, Ebony Eutsey and Kyra Jefferson guide both top squads.
And who can forget about the 
triple jump titleholder Marquis Dendy — a national champion on his own.
Two of Florida’s ﬁ  ve national 
championships come from out-door titles and the men’s team looks back at their repeat champi-onships in 2012 and 2013 to aid for a three-peat.
But before the Gators jump 
ahead to the Historic Hayward Field in Oregon, they must ﬁ  rst qualify in prelims and leave their top ranking behind them.  
“Once the meet is done (nation-
als) that will tell you how your progress was,” Brewer said.
