As homeless shelter Grace Market-
place struggles with a crippling $15,000 
monthly deﬁ  cit just months after its summer launch, county and city com-missioners and even UF President Ber-
nie Machen are looking for ways to keep 
the shelter’s doors open. 
Machen applied to join the Grace 
Marketplace oversight board and was appointed Wednesday afternoon, said Alachua County Commissioner Robert “Hutch” Hutchinson. 
“The fact that he could serve on any 
board of directors for any organization 
and the fact that he applied to serve on 
the oversight committee for Grace Mar-ketplace tells you where his heart is,” said Hutchinson, who also serves on the board.
Machen could not be reached for 
comment.  
He joins Hutchinson and others who 
are looking to alleviate a deﬁ  cit caused 
by insufﬁ  cient funding. 
The shelter, which opened in May 
and is situated at the former Gainesville 
Correctional Institution, was allocated $308,000 — about $150,000 each from the city and Alachua County. 
Jon DeCarmine, operations director 
for the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry, said that money was originally intended for a one-build-ing homeless shelter project. 
Instead, the project grew to a 25-acre 
campus across six buildings.
But the money didn’t grow with it. 
The shelter now needs about $500,000.
DeCarmine said in utility costs alone, 
the shelter projected $2,000 a month and is instead paying about $7,000.
Overall, $25,000 was budgeted in 
utilities per year, but utility costs for the next ﬁ  scal year are projected at $96,000.
In order to cut back, the shelter re-
duced stafﬁ  ng by 20 percent and in-
stalled programmable thermostats. 
About a dozen staffers remain, with one or two working at any given time, he said.
The campus chapel closed Oct. 1, and 
the pavilion, which was open all day and night, is now closed from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
“We have gone to a bare-bones 
maintenance program where we put off repairing things as long as we possibly can,” DeCarmine said. 
He said the shelter is now relying 
heavily on community agencies and churches to donate food and services to keep it running. 
Local 3-D software company Para-
cosm is hosting a Battle of the Bands 
event with other businesses Nov. 22 at The Backyard at Boca Fiesta and Palomi-
no, said Paracosm spokeswoman Julie Natheney. The company hopes to raise about $2,000 for the shelter. 
“A big motivation for Paracosm is 
that we want to inspire other people 
in the tech community to contribute to 
more local causes,” said Natheney. 
At the county level, Hutchison has 
been working to increase funding for the project. He plans to ask for an addi-tional $100,000 to $150,000 at the Nov. 18 county commission meeting. 
The money would be taken from 
county funds left over after the ﬁ  scal 
year ended on Sept. 30. 
He said the issue has grown because 
leaders failed to ask the right questions 
when the project was created. 
“We’ve allowed the problem to get 
so bad that in a sense we’ve created the deﬁ  cit over a decade of not dealing with the issue,” Hutchinson said. 
Alachua County spends $2 million 
a year sheltering dogs and cats, and the nonproﬁ  t sector in the county spends an additional $2 million, he said.  By com-parison, the money that is being asked for to help keep Grace Marketplace open is only a fraction of the county’s costs. 
“It’s just a question of what we as a 
society make a priority,” Hutchinson said. “I think it’s ridiculous that we 
make people sleep outside.”Machen, commissioners will attempt 
to save indebted Grace Marketplace

Dubbed “Limitless,” 
Homecoming Week is 
bringing The Gator Na-tion together once again for the traditional week of 
football, fellowship and 
fun.
Evan Schauder, Home-
coming chairman, said the theme “Limitless” goes with the change of Gator Growl’s location. 
“When we moved to 
Flavet, there were all of 
these new opportuni-
ties that we had, and we thought that ‘Limitless’ encapsulated all of those ideas,” the 22-year-old UF accounting graduate student said.
The annual SunTrust 
Gator Gallop, a 2-mile fun 
run, will kick off today at 
11:30 a.m. at UF’s Percy Beard Track.
At noon, the Home-coming Parade will stroll down University Av-enue.
Growl will follow the 
parade with gates open-ing at 5 p.m. and sched-uled entertainment be-ginning at 6 p.m.
The festival-style cele-
bration hosted by former “Saturday Night Live” comedian Brooks Whee-
lan will feature Grammy 
award-winning artist Lu-dacris and indie pop band Foster the People.
On Saturday, Gator 
football will battle the Missouri Tigers at 7 p.m.
Medline Fleurimond, 
band member and 
21-year-old UF sociology 
junior, said the game will feature new selections from the marching band.
According to a news 
release, restrictions on parking will be put in place around Flavet Field for Growl.UF homecoming

with the new president-elect Kent Fuchs?Today’s question:  Are you sticking around for Home-
coming this weekend?Vatican views of LGBT: a good start
I have been a Roman Catholic all my life. For 18 years, 
I went to church almost every Sunday without fail. While attending Mass, I realized that Catholics are es-
pecially resistant to one thing: change. I have experienced the same liturgy, the same teachings and the same tradi-
tions year after year with little hope of something differ-
ent. The various popes have always looked the same and represented the same values. That is, until the selection of the current pope.
During Pope Francis’ tenure, he has developed a repu-
tation as the people’s pope. His teachings have general-ly reﬂ  ected Jesus’ mercy toward people who have been marginalized and brutalized. His Holiness has even had a gentler tone toward gays and lesbians, saying, “Who am I 
to judge?” when asked about gay men joining the priest-
hood. On Monday, an interim report was released docu-menting a closed-door meeting between Catholic clergy, leaders and Pope Francis himself. In this report, the mem-bers surprisingly praised gays and lesbians for their “gifts” to the church. To many liberal Catholics, this marked the beginning of the road to reversing the church’s position on gay marriage.
Naturally, this friendly nod to the gay community 
made many conservative Catholics furious. The conserva-tives present at the meeting felt as though the report was a misinterpretation of what was discussed. For this and other reasons, the Vatican on Tuesday said the report was a “working document” and did not necessarily create the “impression of a positive evaluation” of same sex mar-riage.
The church needs to make up its mind about same-sex 
marriage and other LGBT issues. The Vatican has so far 
taken a middle-ground position, where gay-friendly lan-
guage is used to appear modern and in touch with these issues. However, it is difﬁ  cult to take this “progressive” shift seriously when Catholic Catechism classiﬁ  es homo-sexual acts as “intrinsically disordered” and calls on gays and lesbians to live in chastity.
As a body of about 1.2 billion people, the church has 
two realistic options. The church can include gays and lesbians as full members and embrace their relationships, or it can go back to its traditional condemnation and judgment. Straddling the fence on this issue 
can send a damaging message to 
LGBT children and young adults who look to the church for moral guidance.
The church also has tremen-
dous inﬂ  uence in countries that marginalize, jail and murder gays and lesbians. The church’s evolving attitude toward the LGBT community can serve as a teaching op-portunity for clergy around the world who can help en-
sure the safety and acceptance of LGBT individuals within 
oppressive societies.
Approving of same-sex relationships will undoubtedly 
infuriate a lot of Catholics. However, Hillary Clinton got it right when she urged people to pay attention to the trend lines, not headlines. The fact is that the trend is moving toward acceptance and tolerance of LGBT individuals and relationships. Although 40 percent of American Catho-lics still oppose same-sex marriage, a growing number of 
Catholics express support for marriage equality.
The Roman Catholic Church has a long way to go in 
eliminating outdated practices. Hopefully the pope and 
the rest of the clergy act on issues such as withholding Communion from divorced and remarried people, cohabi-tation outside of marriage, women joining the priesthood and the use of contraception.
Many people who go to Mass are religious people seek-
ing moral and spiritual guidance. The church should take 
a stand on same-sex relationships and get back to spread-
ing the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus himself spent time with those who were outcast and marginalized and spoke to them about God’s mercy and forgiveness. That’s what we as Catholics are called to do: love one another as God has loved us.

week has had its fair share of odd, good and frightening news for this week’s I-hope-we-don’t-lose-another-homecoming-game edition of....
Darts & Laurels 
Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Charlie Crist 
had their second of three debates Wednesday night. The debate was marked by what might have been 
one of the strangest events in recent political history. Scott initially refused to participate in the debate because Crist had 
a small electric fan on his podium. Scott claimed that the fan 
violated the rules of the debate. Of course, the media took this admittedly bizarre event and ran absolutely wild with it. The front page of Thursday’s Miami Herald website read: “Char-lie Crist and his portable fan have a history together.” The Orlando Sentinel’s read: “‘Fangate’ delays start of Rick Scott, Charlie Crist debate.” The media allowed “Fangate” to dom-inate the debate coverage, giving short shrift to other criti-cal issues raised during the event, like minimum wage and 
federal funding for Medicaid. A get-your-priorities-straight 
DART goes to Florida media outlets.
Despite all the media sensationalism about “Fangate” 
and other issues, there were some rare voices of reason. One 
of those level-headed individuals was Fox News’ Shepard Smith. Speaking about the media’s coverage of the recent Eb-ola cases, Smith said: “Do not listen to the hysterical voices on the radio and the television or read the fear-provoking words online. The people who say and write hysterical things are 
being very irresponsible.” Smith’s words are a welcome con-
trast from the rest of the media, which seem determined to convince us Ebola is hiding behind every corner, just waiting to strike. An everybody-please-just-calm-down LAUREL to 
Shepard Smith.
Unfortunately, it’s not just the media getting worked up 
about Ebola. It seems like every politician, pundit and celeb-rity has contributed his or her two cents on the issue, regard-less of his or her lack of knowledge or expertise. Perhaps the 
worst offender on this front was rapper and noted domestic 
abuser Chris Brown. Brown, who for some reason has 13.6 million Twitter followers, tweeted the following Monday: “I don’t know…But I think this Ebola epidemic is a form of pop-ulation control. S**t is getting crazy bruh.” After being criti-cized and ridiculed by tens of thousands of outraged Twitter users, Brown followed up his conspiracy theory with another tweet: “Let me shut my black ass up!” Good call, Chris. We’re giving a please-never-tweet-again DART to Chris Brown.
HBO has produced some of the most beloved TV shows 
of the last several years: “The Sopranos,” “Boardwalk Em-pire” and “Game of Thrones,” just to name a few. In 2010, the company launched HBO GO, an online and mobile app that allows HBO television subscribers to watch these shows anywhere and anytime. However, HBO made a long-awaited announcement this week that it would begin to offer stand-alone HBO GO subscriptions in 2015 — no cable subscrip-tion required. The move is designed to compete with Netﬂ  ix, 
which has largely dominated the video-streaming market in 
recent years. Though details about price and availability have yet to be released, the new HBO GO represents another step forward in the world of online entertainment. A freedom-
from-the-shackles-of-cable-TV LAUREL goes to HBO.FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2014

When Mila Kunis and 
Justin Timberlake did the friends with 
beneﬁ  ts thing, they made it look easy. If only real life were that fair.
The appeal of a friends 
with beneﬁ  ts relationship, or FWB, is pretty simple. This person and I are friends. We get along really well together and have a lot of fun when we hang out. You know 
what would make it better? Hooking up.
I’m not arguing that sex isn’t great 
and can’t make relationships better, but 
if you’ve ever had a FWB, you know this 
type of relationship hardly ever works 
out.
One of you gets jealous, or someone 
develops feelings, or you’re not on the same page with what you want out of the 
relationship.
Some FWBs do end in success, but it’s 
all too common for them to end poorly — 
ruining both the sex and the friendship.
Kendra Knight, a communications pro-
fessor at DePaul University in Illinois, recently published a study that provides a little more insight into the difﬁ  culty of FWB relationships. With science!
The study focused on communication’s 
effect on FWB relationships. What it found was this: There isn’t really any communi-cation actually going on.
Not having to actually talk is just one 
of the many beneﬁ  ts — pun intended — of the friends with beneﬁ  ts re-lationship model. Or at least, that’s the common consensus.
But apparently that way of 
thinking is the downfall for most casual hookups.
I know in the past when 
I’ve had FWBs, I’ve been re-luctant to have a real conver-sation about it because I don’t 
want it to seem like I’m trying to have “The Talk.”
This was a common fear in partici-
pants, both male and female, of the study: No one wants to appear clingy or desper-ate, so they just don’t say anything.
Not discussing the relationship can 
serve as a way to make it seem less “real,” as well. It’s like, if we don’t talk about it or acknowledge it or remotely act as if we’re hooking up, then this is just a ca-
sual, meaningless relationship.
It’s almost as if a common goal in FWB 
relationships is to see who is the most ca-
sual, who cares the least. No one wants to 
be the person to bring up the “So… we’ve 
been hooking up for a while…” conversa-tion.
I’ll admit that I too have a bad habit of 
avoiding real conversations.
One time, I had a great FWB relation-
ship with a guy I knew, but we never talk-ed about it. We never really acknowledged that we were hooking up or that we were 
some form of a “thing,” however casual 
it was. When it ﬁ  zzled out, we never had a conversation about it. I asked him what happened and he said he “didn’t know.” There was no closure, something that 
probably could have been avoided if we 
had communicated more from the start.
The friends with beneﬁ  ts relationship is 
inherently strange. You’ve got this person 
who you’re friends with, who you prob-
ably hang out with at least semi-regularly, either alone or in a group, but you’re also hooking up with them.
It’s not quite a relationship, but it’s also 
not nearly as casual as a f**k buddy. You have to see this person outside of the bed-room, but you’re also probably not going on dates with him or her.
Here’s the hard truth, for both myself 
and others: If you’re unwilling or unable to have a ﬁ  ve-minute conversation with your partner, you probably shouldn’t be hooking up with him or her.
It doesn’t have to be a long conver-
sation, but it’s good to set some ground rules. How often do you guys plan on hooking up? Only on weekends? Are late-
night booty calls OK? What about post-
coitus cuddling? Do you want to keep it to yourselves or is it OK to tell mutual friends?
So take a few minutes before or after 
— probably not during — your next bed-room adventure to make sure your friends with beneﬁ  ts relationship is as beneﬁ  cial as it can be.

opinions@alligator.orgI appreciate the Alligator’s cov-
erage of peta2’s “I, Chicken” vir-
tual reality exhibit and would like 
to point to a correction in the ar-
ticle. Due to the inclement weath-er Tuesday, our team had to take down the exhibit. 
The peta2 team will be return-
ing in the Spring semester, and I highly encourage students to ex-perience life as a chicken with this cutting-edge, virtual-reality tech-
nology. Chickens are some of the 
most abused animals on the plan-et, and many have their throats slit while still fully conscious. 
More than 1 million are killed ev-
ery hour, and most spend every day of their lives in small cages, denied room outside in their natu-ral environment. 
Fortunately, we can choose to 
avoid this cruelty every time we sit down to eat by eating vegan. If you’re interested in joining Stu-
dent Animal Alliance, you can 
contact me at cbicknell@uﬂ  .edu. I can provide you with your own copy of “Guide to Going Vegan,” which contains pages of informa-
tion on how to make the transition 
to eating cruelty-free.

� CHARISSA KRASNOW COPES 
THROUGH HER ARTWORK.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Staff Writer cwright@alligator.org
Charissa Krasnow’s art speaks more than 
she does.
Unlike the other exhibitors who unabash-
edly revealed their inner demons to total 
strangers, Krasnow sat beside her paintings 
and smiled politely, nodding at every visitor 
who admired her artwork.
Her lively, colorful oil and acrylic pieces 
were arranged with more somber depictions on partitions made of white sheets.
Her centerpiece, “Tree,” was the most strik-
ing: On a stormy background, a naked woman posed on a barren tree, surrounded by birds of prey that feasted on hearts — a symbolized 
breakup. Mirroring her own face, an untitled 
self portrait of a blank stare, preoccupied with her own thoughts, hung on the right.
But unlike the absent woman in her raw 
self portrait, Krasnow could be the prototype for a curvy Barbie doll. Her signature mane of blonde hair complements her blue eyes. Her California look is betrayed by her timid voice, speckled with remnants of a Chicago accent. 
Only on request would she elaborate on her 
muses in whispers.
“Tree” took eight years to complete. Her 
self portrait took 30 minutes.
“It’s like a journey,” Krasnow, 35, said soft-
ly. “A piece of my life went into that.”
Krasnow said she felt no shame participat-
ing in “Reframing Recovery,” an exhibit for artists who use their artwork to cope with men-
tal illness. It was sponsored by the Gainesville 
Opportunity Center earlier this month.
Instead, she saw it as a milestone accom-
plishment. Some paintings were regarded as victories, others as marks of recovery.
“I choose to see it as a mental gift rather 
than a mental illness,” she said.
Her real triumph isn’t that this was her 
ﬁ  rst public exhibit. It’s not about accepting 
her mental illness, either — she came to terms 
with that years ago. It’s that she arrived at the exhibit to set up her carefully selected paint-ings. She made small talk.
She remained in the corner of the room, like a kindergartener who found refuge in the back of a classroom, until closing. With family en-couragement, she ﬁ  nished what she started.
That day — even for just those three hours 
— she conquered her depression, her anxi-ety, her bipolar disorder that consumed eight years of her life.
■   ■   ■
Raising her toddler in Chicago, Karen Kras-
now noticed her daughter could blend colors and stay in between the lines. Charissa had no qualms about expressing herself on paper. In 
the world of art, she was an extrovert.
Yet she had separation anxiety. Any change 
at all was a challenge. Her mother couldn’t 
wean her off a bottle to a sippy cup.
Krasnow’s abnormal interactions with 
groups didn’t diminish through adolescence.
To help her cope, Karen bought art sup-
plies for Krasnow’s 16th birthday.
“I wanted her to have an outlet, and that 
sort of became her outlet instead of her bot-tling it inside,” Karen, 60, said. “I wanted her to express what she was going through.”
Krasnow’s bipolar disorder came alive with every painting. When Krasnow was manic, her brushstrokes were erratic. The subject of her paintings were deeper, darker. 
“Back then, you didn’t really do therapy 
that much,” Karen said. “Certain things took a lot of time and patience.”
Krasnow attended Barat College, a small 
Catholic college in Lake Forest, Illinois. The school closed in 2005, evicting Krasnow fromher creative haven.
Krasnow’s father moved the family to 
Florida and settled in Haile Plantation. She 
eventually enrolled at Santa Fe College, where 
she took an art fundamentals class — her only formal art training.
But a long-term relationship crumbled. 
She stopped taking her medication. She didn’t pick up a paintbrush. She dyed her hair black. She never graduated.
Krasnow has difﬁ  culty recalling that time 
as a 20-something. Colorful canvases are her 
only mementos to a life that her mind invol-
untarily blacked out.
She felt helpless until her younger sister, 
Lauren, 33, took her back to her Catholic faith — and bought her new paint.
Her mother watched Krasnow’s strokes 
transform from erratic to skilled. Krasnow 
also agreed to go back on medication.
“With her, everything is hard but possible 
with patience and understanding,” Karen 
said.
She was saved. For the ﬁ  rst time in months, 
Krasnow picked up a paintbrush again.

The Gainesville Opportunity Center, at 
2772 NW 31st St., helps its 104 members re-
cover from mental illness. 
A few weeks ago, Krasnow followed her 
therapist’s recommendation and walked into 
the center. Initially shy, she mustered up the courage to sit down and strike up conversa-tions, said executive director Pam Demers.
“She was very sweet, bubbly, outgoing,” 
she said.
Krasnow submitted pictures of her art for 
the Reframing Recovery exhibit.
“It made me really happy to get out of the 
house and give me purpose,” Krasnow said.
Krasnow said she knows it will take a while 
for her to hold down a job. For now, she lives with her family and receives disability checks. 
“One thing I want to do one day is work 
with children or anyone who is suffering and just needs to process something and just …
connect with them,” she said.
■   ■   ■
A week has passed since Krasnow’s debut 
at the Reframing Recovery exhibit. Her nerves 
have ﬁ  nally calmed from the exhibit, a week packed with doctor’s appointments and ca-thartic interviews with a reporter.
Insomnia has rendered her restless. For the 
ﬁ  rst time in days, Krasnow picks up her sup-
plies and heads outside. Despite it being in the 
middle of the night, she turns up the Rolling Stones and creates a sea green mixture for her latest piece, titled “Be Not of This World.”
As she paints, she reﬂ  ects on a walk she took 
around her neighborhood earlier. Today was a peaceful day, free of brooding thoughts.
“To be not of this world means I have no 
fear anymore,” she said. “Nothing scares me 
anymore. Even though I have anxiety, I know 
I can walk myself through it. It’s just a process. It’s hard.
“I know I will get through it.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Gators can get their hands on some scaly creatures 
at the Paramount Plaza Hotel and Conference Center 
on Saturday. 
Reptiles, amphibians and small exotic animals will 
be featured and sold at Gainesville’s special one-day 
event called ReptiDay.
The annual event is hosted by Repticon, an orga-
nization that sponsors exotic animal expos around 
Florida. 
Starting at 10 a.m., attendees can participate in 
seminars and interact with vendors offering reptile pets and supplies until 5 p.m.
“You’re going to see things that you are not going 
to see at any pet store,” said John Redd, a Repticon 
events organizer. 
This year, the highly sought-after giant sungazer 
lizard will be a new addition to the event. 
Previous snake owner Andrea Likens, a UF tele-
communication alumna, said she plans on attending. 
 “I love learning about and interacting with ani-
mals of all kinds, and reptiles are something that I 
think are widely misunderstood,” Likens, 23, said. 
Turtles, frogs, iguanas and spiders from the 15 to 
20 vendors will also be on sale.
Redd said the family-friendly event will help chil-
dren learn more about reptiles.
General admission tickets for ReptiDay can be 
purchased at the door. They are $10 for adults, $5 for children ages 5 to 12 and free for kids under 4.Gators not  the 
only reptiles in town anymore CHABELI HERRERA

Five months after Gator Stompin’ — 
Gainesville’s biggest pub crawl — lo-
cal nonproﬁ  t Pledge 5 Foundation still owes vendors, businesses and employ-ees that participated in this year’s event 
about $100,000.
But with the inception of the non-
proﬁ  t’s $50-an-event volunteer credit 
rewards program, Community Over-drive, businesses are asking how the indebted organization plans to fund its incentive program.
“When they haven’t paid the people 
back, how can they even talk about 
that?” said Shauna Dixon, co-owner of 
Durty Nelly’s Irish Pub.
Pledge 5 Director Jason Bowman ex-
plained that the new program is a way for the business to generate money to pay back its debts.
“I don’t want people to confuse us 
trying to generate more revenue with us spending money frivolously,” Bow-
man said.
The new program allows volunteers 
to garner credit toward the purchase of 
a car, Bowman said. The cars in the pro-gram have been purchased from auc-tions for discounted prices.
After being refurbished, the cars are 
then sold to volunteers. Bowman said Pledge 5 expects to make about 50 per-
cent of the original cost of the car back 
from the sales.
Volunteers who attend all 52 events 
can garner up to $2,600 toward a new car. The credit expires after one year.
Before the program, Bowman was 
using revenue from Pledge 5’s two thrift shops, located on West University Avenue and North Main Street, to pay back the debt.
“We needed to look outside the rev-
enue that was being generated at the thrift shops and really get creative in how we were able to accumulate rev-enue,” he said.  
Bowman said the organization has 
been able to chip away at the $150,000 it incurred after Gator Stompin’, but not at the rate he expected.
The delay in payments has discour-
aged some businesses from participat-
ing in future Gator Stompin’ events.
Dixon said Durty Nelly’s will not 
participate in future Pledge 5 pub 
crawls unless major changes are made.
“The whole thing seems very un-
professional,” Dixon said. “We did the best on our behalf to honor everything on the contract, and we would expect everything in return.”
Dixon said Durty Nelly’s has been 
paid back about $150 of the about $1,300 Bowman’s organization owes her. The last check she received, about two months ago, was for $6.
She hasn’t heard from Bowman or 
Pledge 5 since.
“I give up to be honest,” she said.Alex Thomas, owner of 101 Down-
town and 101 Cantina, said he is sur-prised Bowman stuck around and faced the issue.
“He really manned up in that sense 
as far as business is concerned,” Thom-
as said.
Between the two venues, Pledge 5 
owed Thomas more than it owed any 
other business — about $7,500. He has paid back about $500.
Thomas said it can’t be overlooked 
that Bowman created a large event on a Thursday in May when business is usu-ally slow.
“It was just a bad mistake, and we 
have to understand that,” he said. “The customer loves it, don’t forget that. For a restaurant to be angry about it is just shortsighted.”
Shawn Shepherd, owner of Vellos 
Brickstreet Grill and Wahoo Seafood and Grill, said he knows Bowman and also believes he is doing everything in 
his power to return the money.
“He tried and he failed, but he’s pay-
ing us back, and it may be small, but I 
got to give him the attempt,” Shepard said.
Shepard said Pledge 5 still owes him 
about $1,700 from the $2,000 Vellos sold at Gator Stompin’.
“If giving money away will create 
more dollars and giving more money back, I’m all for it,” he said.
Bowman said he takes full respon-
sibility for the debt and attributes it to a miscalculation on the organization’s behalf. This year’s Gator Stompin’ was projected to grow by 20 percent in at-tendance from last year, but instead only grew by 2 percent.
In the coming months, Bowman 
said the business will look into crowd-sourcing to raise money to pay off the debt and possibly make Gator Stompin’ a separate entity from Pledge 5.  Pledge 5 still paying back vendor debt
But it’s paying volunteers

behalf to honor everything on

Start preparing yourself for 
the coming ﬂ  u season with the 
help of the Alachua County 
Health Department, which be-
gan offering ﬂ  u vaccines Tues-day.
Shots are available at the 
health department’s main clin-
ic, 224 SE 24th St., and the City 
of Alachua satellite clinic, locat-
ed in the Hitchcock’s shopping 
plaza on U.S. Highway 441.
“The current vaccine pro-
tects the major circulation 
strains of the ﬂ  u,” said Roger 
Dolz, a health department ad-ministrator.
At the main site, walk-ins 
are accepted Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Alachua location is by ap-pointment only, and appoint-ments can be scheduled by call-
ing 386-462-2542.
Most insurance companies 
cover the cost of the vaccine, 
Dolz said. Out of pocket, a pa-tient will pay $25.
The department runs Con-
trol Flu, a program that collabo-rates with schools to distribute free Flu Mist vaccinations to students who have consent forms, Dolz said.
For the ﬁ  rst time, the depart-
ment reached out to UF’s cam-pus to offer Flu Mist vaccina-tions to college students.
In response, GatorWell part-
nered with the health depart-ment to administer the mist to interested students.
Students will have to bring 
photo identiﬁ  cation, and they will need their insurance cards if they want to receive the mist 
for free. 
Department representatives 
will be at Springs Residential 
Complex on Oct. 28 and Jen-nings Hall on Oct. 30 to distrib-ute the vaccines.
The Student Health Care 
Center started offering UF stu-dents traditional ﬂ  u shots Oct. 
3, according to the center’s 
spokeswoman, Catherine See-mann.
The center and its outreach 
clinics combined administer about 500 shots a day, Seemann said, which amounts to more than 4,000 vaccines distributed so far.
“We have the shipments, 
and we will stop giving them out when we run out,” she said.
About 50 percent of the ﬂ  u 
shot shipments have been used, she said, and the center will likely not order more ﬂ  u shots after they’re gone.
If demand is high in No-
vember, Seemann said a new shipment may be considered.Alachua County

Second Street in Cedar Key will 
be ﬂ  ooded with tourists and locals 
Saturday and Sunday for the city’s 45th Annual Seafood Festival.
From 9 a.m to 5 p.m., patrons 
will stroll the street to Cedar Key City Park for a taste of the festival’s world famous seafood.
Sue Colson, vice mayor of Ce-
dar Key, said the town of about 700 swells to 15,000 for the festival each year, “but we haven’t sunk yet.”
“I like to call it ‘island time,’” Col-
son said. “Sometimes people need a little island time, and here, it’s just 
eating and relaxing.”
Arts and crafts will line the street, 
and an assortment of nonproﬁ  t sea-
food vendors will pack the park, of-fering items like crab cakes, oysters, clams and grouper sandwiches.
The festival will feature the 
Smithsonian Institution’s The Way We Worked exhibit, which shows 
the lives of blue-collar Americans. 
Thelma Cain, president of the 
Cedar Key Lioness Club, which is co-hosting the festival with the city’s 
Lions Club, said although crab cakes are her specialty, she’ll be making fried mullet dinners to go along with the exhibit.
“That’s how we started this 44 
years ago,” Cain said. “It was fried mullet and oysters on the half-shell.”Seafood festival reels in thousands

Students looking for a cup of joe 
on campus no longer have the con-
venience of coffee delivery.
GoJoe, a campus coffee delivery 
service, has come to a standstill after its two owners graduated from UF in May.
Students now have to stick it 
through the long lines for a cup of coffee on campus. 
The service’s app, ﬁ  rst released in 
January, allowed students to pay for 
coffee and have it delivered to them 
wherever they were on campus.
With coffee backpacks fully 
equipped with cream and sugar, Go-Joe employees delivered the coffee. 
GoJoe co-founder Marcus Calpa-
kis, a 21-year-old information sys-
tems and economics UF alumnus, 
said now the options are either to sell the company to UF or another campus or to let it go altogether.
“When we opened it up back 
in January we had a very good de-mand, but unfortunately not enough of a demand to continue after gradu-ation,” Calpakis said.
Natalie Lamb, a 20-year-old UF 
geology junior, said she drinks one or two cups of coffee every morn-ing. 
“If coffee was delivered right 
to where you were, it would be an awesome idea for people in a study group or people in the library,” Lamb said.GoJoe graduates unsure

Bill Leonard has only missed 
three UF Homecoming games 
since 1970.  
With orange and blue along 
the walls, the Leonard home is 
ready for this week’s game.
Bill, 61, and his wife, Mela-
nie, 60, moved back to their col-
lege town of Gainesville eight months ago for early retire-ment. Melanie retired as a ﬂ  ight attendant after 30 years of ser-vice while Bill still practices law in small claims court.
Bill and Melanie have decid-
ed to give back to UF’s College of Journalism and Communica-tions’ clubs and organizations for the second year in a row.  
Melanie said she’s happy to 
be able to help student organi-zations this year.
“We wanted to do some-
thing that beneﬁ  ted more than one person,” she said.
The couple is covering the cost of food for journalism clubs for the Homecoming tailgate party hosted outside Weimer 
Hall.  The clubs use this oppor-
tunity to raise money for their organizations by selling food for $5 before kickoff.
All the extra money made 
from the tailgate barbecue will go straight to the clubs.
“Whatever comes in is theirs. 
Their gross is net,” Bill said.
Bill, a 1974 UF advertising 
alumnus, said he hopes their 
donation inspires other alumni 
to donate.
“We’d like to challenge The 
Gator Nation to giving back to the school,” he said. “We want alum-ni and friends to donate to the col-leges they’re interested in.”The couple previously set 
up a scholarship in the School of Theater and Dance in the

“I think it’s an awesome 
opportunity for the college’s 
organizations to earn an extra amount of money to put on events and make their organiza-tions better for students,” said Justin Galicz, president of Jour-nalism and Communications 
Ambassadors and 21-year-old 
UF journalism senior.
Bill said he and Melanie will 
continue to cover the cost of food each year. The Leonards plan on establishing a scholar-ship for a journalism student.
“I think that people who 
have been blessed with much 
— and an education from the 
University of Florida is a bless-ing — should do well with what they have been given,” he said.

ers to enjoy the same opportu-nity to attend the University of Florida that we enjoyed.”UF journo alum to host tailgate

George Fryar heard a whimpering coming from a 
sinkhole Wednesday morning: his Rottweiler puppy, 
Dicie.
“I couldn’t see her, but I could hear her and didn’t 
know how I was going to get her out,” Fryar said. “I felt kind of helpless.”
Dicie fell into roughly 13-foot-deep sinkhole Tues-
day morning and had been stuck below for about 36 hours before she was rescued Wednesday night by a group of rescue organizations, including the UF Vet-erinary Emergency Treatment Service (VETS).
At just 6 and a half months old, the 60-pound pup-
py escaped from her pen Tuesday morning while Fryar was at a doctor’s appointment. He said Dicie’s sister, Mae, also escaped but came back without her.
Fryar, 60, searched for Dicie for almost 24 hours 
before he heard the whimpering in an 80-acre field across from his home in O’Brien, Florida, about an hour northwest of Gainesville.
Fryar called his dog’s veterinarian, who then 
called VETS. The rescue team worked with Suwan-nee County Fire Department and Suwannee County Animal Services to dig their way to Dicie, said VETS team leader John Haven.
Haven said they used a huge industrial forklift to get Dicie out of the sinkhole. The sinkhole was about a foot wide and was filled with water at the bottom.
“We had to make sure that we weren’t knocking 
any dirt or rocks down into the water because that would make the water level rise and might even drown her,” he said.
It took VETS and the other groups about two 
hours to dig out Dicie. She was slightly hypothermic, dehydrated and covered in sand when they rescued her.
“It was almost kind of caked on her like cement or 
something,” Fryar said.
Fryar said Dicie was evaluated and had no cuts, 
fractures or broken bones. He said Dicie is still weak but is doing well, despite a slight hobble.
“It’s not about me, it’s about what the team at UF 
and what the firemen and the people who brought the heavy equipment and the people that were there to get her out,” Fryar said. 
Haven said Fryar is a really determined owner 
and was concerned about the safety of the rescuers 
the whole time.
“I don’t have any two-legged children, all my chil-
dren are four-legged,” Haven said. “My dogs are my 
kids, and clearly it was the same way with him, and to be able to (reunite) his family was just really awe-some.”Puppy rescued from sink hole

Gainesville’s creative commu-
nity came together to share per-
sonal experiences through story-telling Thursday night at the Civic Media Center.
StudioCo.de = Narrations, an 
open-mic style event, encouraged students and professionals to ex-perience personal narratives and make meaningful connections. The event brought people of all differ-ent backgrounds, including guest storyteller and local artist Vivian Filer, 76.
Filer, a Santa Fe College nurs-
ing department retiree, shared her personal experience with seg-regation and later integration at Gainesville’s original Lincoln High School.“If you’re white, you’re alright. 
If you’re brown, stick around. If you’re black, stay back,” Filer said 
during her narrative.
One of the event organizers, 
Sarah Vidal-Finn, worked on the 
production side of the event, find-ing the venue and helping concep-tualize the night.
“At our events, you never know 
who is going to show up,” Vidal-Finn said.
The evening continued with 
other speakers sharing stories on leadership, racism, sexism and sexuality.
From the audience, Lauren Ja-
dotte listened to their stories.

She had waited ﬁ  ve days, and this 
time, the deputy had news.
Sarah Lambert stood in a circle 
grasping the hands of her sisters and 
family friends.
We found a body, the deputy told 
them. 
She had white knuckles now. 
They all did.
It’s Kim.His words were a blow, knocking 
the wind out of Sarah for just a mo-ment. Then, she didn’t have time to feel. She had to comfort her sisters and listen to the deputies and get ev-eryone ready to head to the station for more interviews.
The only thing louder than her 
youngest sister’s sobs were her own thoughts, looping over and over again: How am I going to get through 
this?
■   ■   ■
Sarah’s mother, Kim Lindsey, was 
murdered by her ex-husband almost a year ago. Albert Lambert, Sarah’s father, broke into her house and shot her with a .22-caliber handgun he’d bought weeks before from a pawn shop, according to a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce report. He then disposed of her body in a canal after cutting off her head and ﬁ  ngers. When deputies went to arrest him about a week later, they discovered he’d overdosed on pills. He was pro-nounced dead at the hospital.
For Sarah, a 21-year-old UF stu-
dent, the information didn’t come in a neat paragraph. It was revealed over the course of a week, in visits from deputies, in instinctual hunch-es, in conversations with family and friends.
On Oct. 28, just before her Intro-
duction to Hispanic Linguistics class, Kim’s co-worker — a fellow nurse at Bak Middle School of the Arts — tex-ted Sarah that her mom hadn’t come into work that morning. 
Then, during class, a text from 
her uncle saying the same thing. Her hands started to shake. 
When Sarah tried contacting her 
mother after class, she got no re-sponse. She reached out to her mom’s friends and her two younger sisters — Soﬁ  a and Savannah, 18 and 16 then. No one had heard from Kim.
At 5 p.m., she left Gainesville with 
her boyfriend at the time. By 9, she was at a friend of her mom’s in West Palm Beach. That night, she helped create the Facebook page “Find Kim Lindsey,” which now has about 7,500 likes. She contacted an organization dedicated to ﬁ  nding missing people. She cracked her mom’s email and phone passwords. 
“There was a lot of pressure on me 
because I am the ﬁ  rstborn,” she said. “They were asking me to make all the major decisions.”
Like organizing a press confer-
ence, which the sisters had to shop for since they rushed home from school without packing. Like discussing her youngest sister’s guardianship, in case the search turned bad. Like deal-ing with her father’s text messages: Are you and your sisters OK? Call me if you need me. I love you.
During that week, she became her 
mother. She had to.
Kim’s close friend, Karen Dietrick, 
said they all called her “Little Kim.” 
Karen, 49, had been friends with 
Kim for about a decade, part of a group of ﬁ  ve close-knit moms called the Ya-Yas, after the 1996 book about four lifelong friends titled “The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.”
Karen’s house served as headquar-
ters for the week Kim was missing. Savannah, still in high school, lives with her now, along with Karen’s husband and their daughters.
“Kim would’ve gone to Colombia 
and rescued my children from rebel forces,” she said. “For me to take on these three girls ... it wasn’t even a question.”
Karen described Kim as “this 
Texas, cowboy-boot-wearing, I-can-do-anything, tall, blonde, powerful force.”
She married Albert for his passion 
and charm. But that dissipated over time, and Kim no longer felt like her-self around him. Albert, who Karen described as unattractive, heavy and balding, would dig at Kim’s conﬁ  -dence. He threatened her, but no one took him seriously, Karen said. 
Sarah stopped speaking to her fa-
ther in September 2012. She described him as narcissistic and cruel. During the divorce, he vacationed and went on cruises but still complained about paying her college tuition.
At a divorce-related court hear-
ing on Oct. 25 — three days before Kim was reported missing — Albert Lambert told a judge he’d either “dis-appear or go to jail” before he paid anything.
When a deputy interviewed Sarah 
soon after Kim disappeared, he asked if she thought her dad was capable of hurting her mother.
“Some people could be pushed to a 
point since … it’s such high tension,” she said in a recorded interview. “I think my dad could potentially, but I don’t know if he would.”
Despite the difﬁ  cult marriage, Kim 
maintained a sense of humor raising her children. She’d use a squawking rubber chicken to jar Savannah out of bed when she wouldn’t wake up. She’d take out a water gun and squirt it at her daughters in the car for no reason. When the four of them would roll through the Taco Bell drive-thru, they’d practice saying the Mexican dishes in the most hick ways possible: “Fuh-JAI-tuh,” “Kay-suh-DILL-a.” 
That same humor was peppered 
through the week Kim was miss-ing, even without her. It kept them strong.
Even sitting in the lawyer’s ofﬁ  ce, 
discussing Savannah’s guardianship, health care directives and the power of attorney. Even as Sarah wrote her mother’s eulogy. 
On the ﬁ  rst day of November, 
deputies came to Karen’s home with the news that Kim’s decapitated body had been found in Hendry County. 
“I just remember thinking there 
is literally no decision I can make 
that can change this,” Sarah recalled. 
“This is permanent.”
Kim’s family and friends gathered 
a few days later at a church in West 
Palm Beach for the memorial service.
Sarah, wearing her mother’s 
pearl earrings, delivered the eulogy at the standing-room-only service. She warned the audience during the speech that she may “start crying like a 2-year-old.” But her low voice re-mained strong:
“My name’s Sarah, and Kim was 
my mom.”
■   ■   ■
Two days after reading her moth-
er’s eulogy, Sarah returned to UF. 
She attended Gator Growl, UF’s 
Homecoming pep rally, with the tickets she bought before her mother went missing. She read “Anna Kar-enina,” “Dr. Zhivago” and half of “Lolita” in a week to ﬁ  nish up a Rus-sian literature class.  
With the help of professors offer-
ing deadline extensions, she earned straight A’s.
Walking through campus, she’d 
feel relieved when people wouldn’t recognize her from the press cover-age. She’d see friends she hadn’t talked to in months and avoid them. She’d forego nights out for nights in with her phone turned off. 
She wasn’t the girl she was before 
Oct. 28, a star in “The Sarah Show,” as Karen called it, because her per-sonality commanded a room. And she wasn’t Little Kim, holding the world together by her ﬁ  ngertips with no time to process the loss. 
In those months, she was working 
to digest what happened and reclaim her place in the world, not as the girl whose father killed her mother and himself. But as the girl who, under those tragic circumstances, learned to live again.
One of the ﬁ  rst steps came in 
January, at a diversity retreat called Gatorship that she’d applied to be-fore Kim’s disappearance. During a segment about race, the retreat split into groups. Sarah didn’t feel much attachment to her Cuban side — her dad’s side. But it was a part of her, and she felt that now more than ever. 
She joined the multiethnic group 
where, in front of half a dozen people, she revealed her story: that her His-panic side comes from the man who killed her mother.
The leader called for a moment of 
silence. The only noise in the room was Sarah trying to stiﬂ  e her sobs.
Group members came up to her 
afterward to offer hugs and words of encouragement. And she let them.
As winter turned to spring, Sarah 
started to regain her footing. 
She chopped off her hair, which 
used to be down to her waist, and donated it at a cancer cure fundraiser. She went to her classes and hung out with friends. She took up biking. It was easy to pedal when the light was green and stop when the light was red. She didn’t have to think.
One morning in April, she biked 
in the rain to a physics lecture. The class is mostly underclassmen, but Sarah, a junior at the time and a se-nior now, had to take it after adding the pre-dental track to her Spanish and linguistics double major.
Much of her parent’s brutal two-
and-a-half year divorce was tainted by ﬁ  nances. Her mother had a tough time supporting her daughters on a school nurse salary. Her father, a doctor at a hospital in Okeechobee, didn’t help. Sarah didn’t want money to dictate her life in the same way.
During a class break, she met a 
friend for lunch. On the mile-long walk to the Plaza of the Americas, she waved to about a dozen people she knew and said bless-yous to sneezing strangers.
At lunch, a member of UF’s sky-
diving club came by with ﬂ  iers. 
“Do you want to go skydiving 
for our birthdays?” Sarah asked her friend.
“No, I’m afraid of heights,” the 
friend said back.
“So am I. Let’s do it.” It was a fun thought, doing some-
thing daring and adventurous for her birthday, coming up on April 30. But in reality, the day made her nervous.
She was turning 21. Her moth-
er shared the same birthday and would’ve turned 50.
The pair used to joke about how 
they would “turn up” for their mile-stone birthdays, Sarah said. 
As the day grew closer, she felt the 
uncertainty creep in. How am I going 
to handle this? How am I going to get through the day?
The year before, her boyfriend 
threw her a surprise party. Her friends wanted her to count down to midnight with them, but Sarah 
refused. She wanted to call her mom 
instead.
This year, Sarah was with her boy-
friend again, but it was just them. He baked her a chocolate coconut cake. 
He sang her happy birthday.
Ten minutes later, Sarah locked 
herself in the bathroom and cried 
with her head in her hands. 
“I missed her,” she said.
But she knew the tears would 
stop. They always did.
As a child, Sarah could never 
decide what she wanted for her 
birthday, so she asked her parents 
to donate to charities instead. This 
year, she took to Facebook to make the same request. She wrote on the 
Find Kim Lindsey page encouraging 
friends and family to donate to Aid to 
Victims of Domestic Abuse.
“Please help us in the struggle 
against domestic violence, and help 
us prevent more senseless tragedies 
like the case of our parents,” she 
wrote. 
Later that evening, she met a 
group of about 15 friends at an Asian 
cafe for her birthday dinner. 
The waiter came around and ev-
eryone ordered. Except Sarah, who, 
in this moment, was just a 21-year-
old overwhelmed by a long menu.
“I love the people here too much,” 
she said. “Now don’t talk to me so I 
can pick.”
She spent most of the night on her 
feet, walking down the table to check in with her guests. At one point, a 
friend ordered a round of sake shots.
After some convincing, Sarah took 
one off the tray and downed it. Across 
the table, someone said, “Birthday 
girl’s turning up!” 
■   ■   ■
On a warm morning in mid-Oc-
tober, Kim’s friends and family all 
came together again wearing “Team Kim” T-shirts. Instead of holding hands and crying, they joked and laughed together, waiting for the Aid to Victims of Domestic Abuse Race for Hope to begin.
Instead of receiving the bad news 
that their friend and mother had died, they received the good news that Team Kim had raised upwards of $16,000 for the race’s cause. 
Sarah ﬁ  led into line as the sun 
crept over the Delray Beach Horizon. Like her mother, she’s always hated running. But when the blow horn went off, so did she, jogging beside Karen’s eldest daughter, Ryenne.
They kept up their pace down a 
beachfront road as the sun rose higher and sweat started to slide down their faces. As the pair crested the top of a hill and the ﬁ  nish line was in sight, Sarah challenged Ryenne to race the rest of the way.
Sarah broke away, pumping her 
arms back and forth and widening her stride. 
She ran straight through the ﬁ  n-
ish line, right into the arms of a group from Team Kim. One of them asked how it was.
“It was so worth it,” she said.Then, one of her friends tossed 
water on her from a water bottle, and Sarah tossed water back, and they laughed and hugged and walked up the hill to grab food.
The hard part was over.

was able to hold my head high and look to-wards the future.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer@Graham311
Although she comes from a school just 5.4 
miles from the University of Florida’s cam-
pus, Viktorija Dimaite actually hails from Pa-nevezys, Lithuania, a good 5,223 miles from Gainesville.
Dimaite arrived in Gainesville fresh from 
competing with the Lithuanian Under-16 national team that had just ﬁ  nished a strong campaign in the 2008 European Champion-ships.
She enrolled at The Rock School, where 
coach Fabian Chapov was hoping to expand on the success the basketball program had seen in recent years.
The rise of the program is an interesting 
one, wrought with Florida High School Ath-letic Association recruiting violations amidst basketball dominance.
The Rock School, a local K-12 school with 
less than 300 students, joined the FHSAA in 1997.
After several years of modest success, The 
Rock School developed into a basketball pow-
erhouse after deciding to spread their Chris-
tian message to a global audience.
In 2005, it created an international students program that helped usher in numerous foreign basket-
ball players to Gainesville.
The result was an inﬂ  ux 
of talent that included Di-maite as well as three other players from the Lithuanian 
Junior National team and 
later included Philadelphia 76ers rookie Joel Embiid.
Before the Lithuanians could arrive, how-
ever, The Rock School admitted recruiting violations to the FHSAA, who in turn placed them on probation for the 2007-08 season. The school’s athletic director and current men’s basketball coach Justin Harden said continu-
ing to compete wasn’t an issue after the viola-
tion.
The 2009-10 season turned out to be the 
most successful in the program’s history, with Dimaite and her teammates leading the Lions to a FHSAA Class 1A girls basketball state championship over Hollywood Christian.
It would be the last FHSAA basketball 
championship for The Rock School, as the 
program decided to withdraw from FHSAA 
competition amidst repeated pressure from the athletic association concerning recruiting violations that spanned an international level.With no state title to defend, the Lions 
played a more wide-reaching schedule against other non-FHSAA and had a more extensive travel schedule.
With scholarship offers coming in, Dimaite 
had a decision to make: where would she con-tinue her career?
Dimaite wanted to stay “close to home” or 
at least, close to the home she had in the Unit-ed States – Gainesville.
So when Florida women’s basketball coach 
Amanda Butler came calling, Dimaite knew that there was no better place for her.
She wouldn’t have to leave her new home.Butler convinced Dimaite to redshirt her 
freshman season so she could develop her 
strength and skill.
Before she began her training regimen, 
however, Dimaite was set to compete in the 
Under-20 European Championships for her home country.
Neither of these plans would come to frui-
tion, as Dimaite dislocated her right ankle the day before she was set to leave. The injury kept her out the entire season.
Instead of building strength and improv-
ing, Dimaite was stuck rehabbing.
She was frustrated, to say the least.After working her way back and practicing with the team, Dimaite looked for a fresh start. That wouldn’t come either.
Dimaite tore the ACL and medial meniscus 
in her left knee in a non-contact drill at practice on Nov. 3, 2012. In her absence, the team had little size, and any expectations they had were lessened with the 6-4 center’s vacancy.
Eleven months later, Dimaite tore the same 
ACL doing something she’s done thousands of times – running up the court.
“It’s discouraging, yeah,” Dimaite said. 
“But at the same time I can’t think about it.”
It’s hard not to.Hoping to put her injury troubles behind 
her, Dimaite is ﬁ  nally hoping to start a basket-ball career that has been delayed in the sad-
dest of ways.
She’s spent the offseason training, still hop-
ing to rebuild the strength in her knee that is 
critical to supporting her height.
The soreness isn’t gone, and it might not 
ever be gone. 
“I feel like I have good and bad days, but 
I’m having more good days than bad,” Di-maite said. “I’ve talked with my trainer and he 
says that’s going to happen. I’m still practic-
ing but will limit my reps. Conditioning wise, I feel like I’ll do everything the exact same as the team.”
Fresh start: Dimaite back on the court, ready to contribute

Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
Homecoming week at the University of 
Florida is typically a lighthearted time of year. 
There are fun events all week throughout 
campus, the annual homecoming parade on 
Friday and alumni pouring into Gainesville for 
a weekend to remember their cherished alma 
mater. 
But for the Florida (3-2, 2-2 Southeastern 
Conference) football team, the game against Missouri (4-2, 1-1 SEC) on Saturday night is anything but a happy-go-lucky affair. 
Saturday evening’s game, which is set to 
kickoff at 7 and will air on ESPN2, is critical if the Gators want to keep their SEC East title 
hopes alive. 
The SEC East standings currently have No. 
10 Georgia at the top with a 3-1 conference re-
cord — the one loss coming from South Caro-lina. 
Behind the Bulldogs is Kentucky, whose 
lone conference loss was the 36-30 triple over-time thriller in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on Sept. 13. Then comes Florida, who is helped by their 
only two SEC losses coming from West oppo-nents Alabama and LSU. Missouri has a win over South Carolina and lost to Georgia 34-0 last week.  
A win over Missouri on Saturday, and the 
Gators will be in a very favorable position in the East race. 
Florida running back Matt Jones believes 
the path to Atlanta is very clear heading into 
the game. 
“We have next up Missouri, Georgia, Van-
derbilt. We’ve got to win like four games 
straight. They’re all beatable teams,” Jones said. “We’ve got it right in our hands. It’s just like taking candy from a baby. We’ve got to go get it. We’re going to execute.”
Beating Missouri is much easier said than 
done. This is a Missouri team that returned 
eight starters from a squad that made it to the 
SEC Championship only a year ago before los-ing to Auburn in the fourth quarter.
On offense, Tigers quarterback Maty Mauk 
is familiar with the Gators defense — the red-shirt sophomore made his ﬁ  rst career start against Florida in Columbia, Mo., last year and threw for 295 yards and a touchdown as Mis-souri took a 36-17 win.
But Mauk is not just a drop-back passer, evi-
denced by his 110 rushing yards this season.
“Once he gets out of the pocket, now your defense starts to break down and then he’s got 
a run-pass option and you’ve got to stay in cov-
erage,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “He is not just a scrambler. He can throw the ball too and he throws it on the run.” 
Mauk gets help this week as his three veteran 
wide receivers — Bud Sasser, Darius White and Jimmie Hunt — are all back and fully healthy. 
On the defensive side, the Tigers are led by 
two disruptive defensive linemen in Shane Ray 
and Markus Golden. Ray currently leads the 
SEC in sacks (eight) and tackles for loss (12.5), and the duo combined has 71 total tackles.
Florida’s offensive line has given up only 
ﬁ  ve sacks this season, but protecting the quar-terback will be crucial this week as true fresh-man Treon Harris will take snaps on Saturday night.
“They’ve got to understand that it’s going to 
be a challenge that way and they’re not going to win every battle. And the quarterbacks have to understand that,” offensive coordinator Kurt Roper said. “We’ve got to be able to play fast and get the ball out of our hand, because those guys win their fair share of opportunities.”
How reps will be split between Harris and 
the usual starter Jeff Driskel remains to be seen. Muschamp hinted that Driskel would still start, 
but the fourth-year head coach said he and 
Roper would make a ﬁ  nal decision as game-time approaches.

The Gators prepare to run onto the ﬁ  eld during UF’s 30-27 loss to LSU at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Florida plays Missouri on Saturday 
in a game that will have implications on its chances to reach the Southeastern Conference Championship in December.
You’re in luck this week.
For just seven days, we here at al-
ligatorSports Brands Pick Column will 
be giving away our autographs … for 
free.
That’s right. We won’t charge you 
like Georgia running back Todd Gurley 
and Florida State quarterback Jameis 
Winston allegedly did in the past.
We don’t need the money. Well, we 
do, but that’s beside the point.
You’re probably thinking, “Why 
would I want some scoundrel college journalists autograph?”
Good point, you probably don’t, but 
it’s free and people love free stuff.
But let’s get real. It’s homecoming 
weekend and Florida is still in the run-ning for the Southeastern Conference Eastern Division title.
Now whether you think quarter-
back Jeff Driskel should start, or coach Will Muschamp should be ﬁ  red, let’s remember the most important part of homecoming weekend: lots of alcohol 
and Ludacris.
Debating the Game of the Week — 
No. 10 Georgia’s trip to Fayetteville to 
take on unranked Arkansas — are al-
ligatorSports editor Jordan McPherson

quiet from football work while she con-
tinues her coverage of the Gators vol-leyball team.)
Georgia (-3) is going to sign off 
with the win because...
I get that everyone thinks it’s Arkan-
sas’ time to break out and get an SEC win, but this is not the team it’s going 
to happen against. While Georgia’s had 
its struggles, I think Mark Richt has a game plan. And as I always say, a man with a plan is really, just a guy with a plan. 
But seriously, any doubts I may have 
had about Georgia’s run game without Gurley are gone after witnessing run-Picks

Michael Frazier II is Florida’s lone returning starter from last 
season’s Final Four run. The junior shooting guard connected 
on 46.1 percent of his three-point attempts during the 2013-14 season and set a school record for three-point baskets in a sea-son (118) and in a game (11 vs. South Carolina). Frazier ﬁ  nished the season on the All-Southeastern Conference Tournament and NCAA All-South Region Tournament teams.
1.) What are you doing to improve your game?
“Just getting my shot off the dribble is the biggest thing 
I needed to work on and I worked on it a lot this summer. 
Yeah, just having the right mindset going into this season and not having my expectations too high so I don’t get too low and just stay even keeled.”
2.) How can this team be solid defen-
sively?
“I mean this system that we’re in 
it doesn’t matter who is here. We can learn a lot from last year’s team but if we come  with the mindset everyday to work 
and get better at defense, we’re going to 
be good.”
3.) What is the team’s style of play go-
ing to be like this season?
“I think we’re going to get up and down more. Try to get 
some more easy buckets. Just playing in the open ﬂ  oor more 
because we have some good athletes on this team compared to last year. We’re still going to have to execute in the half-court.”
4.) What is the talent level of this team?“I mean this is probably the most talented team I’ve been 
on since I’ve been playing basketball. I’ve been on some pretty good teams.”
5.) How important will it be for you to be a leader since 
you’re the only returning starter?
“It’s important. I think guys are going to look at me and 
see how I respond to certain things, and I have to lead by example. When things aren’t going well I can’t get down on myself because if I do that then other guys are going to look at me and they might get down on themselves. We can’t have that as a team. I think just me leading by example, doing what I do, working hard and the rest takes care of itself.”Five questions with returning starter Michael Frazier II

� THE GATORS WERE UNDEFEATED IN SEC 
PLAY BEFORE THURSDAY’S LOSS.
ALEX MAMINAKIS
Alligator Writer @alexmaminakis
A second-half comeback wasn’t enough to make 
up for a disappointing ﬁ  rst half as No. 5 Florida fell to 
South Carolina in a heartbreaker on Thursday night.
The Gators (11-3, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) 
dropped their ﬁ  rst conference match of the season, 
losing 3-2 to the Gamecocks (10-4-1, 3-3-1 SEC) in Co-
lumbia, S.C. The loss was the Gators’ ﬁ  rst since Sept. 12, ending a seven-game winning streak.
Throughout the game, Florida struggled with 
maintaining possession. It gave away numerous un-forced errors, especially in the defensive half, which led to South Carolina’s ﬁ  rst two goals.
Sophomore midﬁ  elder Chelsea Drennan put in the 
ﬁ  rst goal for the Gamecocks — her third of the season 
— in just the second minute of the match. Freshman 
midﬁ  elder Savannah McCaskill added another goal in the 34th minute, increasing the lead to two goals — the largest deﬁ  cit that Florida has faced all season.
The Gators have struggled with giving up early 
goals as of late, which is something coach Becky Bur-leigh would like to see change.
“A little bit concerned about the early goal, we just 
gotta come out better, ready to play,” Burleigh said. 
“That’s just a mental preparation thing I think.”Florida knew heading into the match with South 
Carolina that it wouldn’t be an easy game by any 
means. 
Coming into the game, the Gamecocks led the SEC 
with only six goals allowed. Their senior goalkeeper Sabrina D’Angelo and their defensive line are having a season to remember.
Havana Solaun wanted to do 
something about that.
In the 66th minute, Solaun put 
Florida on the board with a bullet 
into the upper 90, her third goal of her senior season. 
And she wasn’t done.Solaun then tied the match with an 85th minute 
goal to surely give Florida the draw and send Caro-lina home disappointed.
“I was always glad to see Havana shoot because 
it’s something we keep encouraging her to do,” Bur-leigh said. “She certainly made an impact with those two shots. Those were awesome.”
But just minutes later, in the 89th minute of the 
90-minute match, McCaskill ﬁ  nished a header off of a corner kick and gave South Carolina the 3-2 lead with only a minute left.
On Thursday night, it was South Carolina’s Savan-
nah that turned out to be the hero, not Florida’s.
“One game, no matter win, loss, whatever, doesn’t 
deﬁ  ne our season,” Burleigh said. “I think our team will show some resilience in this loss because they’re a mature team and they’re gonna grow from this, I’m 
very conﬁ  dent of that.”Florida loses late to South Carolina

Arkansas (+3) will cash out a 
victory at home because...
The Bulldogs have yet to face a 
formidable run game this season. 
That changes on Saturday. The Ra-zorbacks have arguably the best 
one-two punch at running back in 
sophomore Alex Collins and junior Jonathan Williams. Arkansas hasn’t won an SEC game since Oct. 13, 2012. That streak ends this week.

Now onto the picks!
In ﬁ  rst place at 29-25 is alligator-
Sports staff writer Jonathan “Venti 
hot chocolate” Czupryn, who or-dered his basic beverage of choice 
at a Starbucks during our road trip 
to Knoxville, Tenn., two weeks ago. Wow, man. Next you’re going to tell me that you’ve read “Gone Girl.” Wait a minute...Also sitting at the top of the totem 
pole is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar 
“My Sister Beat Me Up” Thompson, 
who admitted this sad, sad tale last week. Unfortunately, Edgar, this doesn’t surprise any of us. Not even Muschamp.
Sitting in third at an even 27-27 is 
alligatorSports staff writer Morgan “Where are you?” Moriarty, who is 
difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  nd at the majority of the 
football media availabilities. Some-times it’s because she is at one of her 18 million other jobs. Other times it’s because we can’t see her head above 
the seat.
In a tie for fourth at 26-28 is alli-
gatorSports editor Jordan “Landon” McPherson and Landon “Jordan” 
Watnick. At football media avail-ability on Monday, Associated Press writer Mark Long mixed up Jordan and Landon’s names when assign-
ing people for transcribing Will 
Muschamp’s press conference. How does that even happen? Anyway, we’re sorry that happened to you, 
Jordan.FINALLY out of dead-ass last 
and putting up a sixth-place perfor-mance at 25-29 is 247Sports.com’s 
Thomas “...” Goldkamp, who is so damn boring we don’t have any-thing to say about him. Maybe if you spent more time outside instead 
of analyzing ﬁ  lm, we might get to 
know a thing or two about you, bud.And in dead-ass-last with a 
piss-poor record of 24-30 is alliga-
torSports.org editor Richard “spicy 
coleslaw” Johnson, who announced his intrigue in the food staple on Wednesday’s alligatorSports pod-cast despite his hate for mayonaise. 
Really man? You’ll eat cole slaw, 
hate mayo and won’t walk into a Chipotle without having a heart at-tack? I guess that ﬂ  u is really mess-ing with your head right now.
Joining Richard in dead-ass-last is 
Gator Country’s Nick “Should I even try anymore?” de la Torre, who has fallen rapidly in the picks column and hasn’t had the chance to resur-
face. No worries, Nick. Goldkamp 
was in this same spot. You might be able to shake this one off.

LW Mizzou TAMU UGACoach Will Mus-
champ’s man-tra has been 
the same all season.
After every win 
and after every loss, 
a reiteration of the same phrase is always heard.
“Everything is still 
in front of us.”
The Gators’ goal is simple: Win 
the Southeastern Conference East-ern Division and make it to Atlanta for the ﬁ  rst time since 2009 — two seasons before Muschamp took over as the program’s head coach.
Right now, the goal is within 
reach.
But that has nothing to do with 
how well Florida has played this 
season. Rather, it’s due to the fact 
that the SEC East has no clear frontrunner halfway through the season.
Preseason favorite South Caro-
lina already has three losses in conference play — including an embarrassing 52-28 beating from Texas A&M to open up the year 
and back-to-back defeats that came 
at the hands of Missouri (21-20) and Kentucky (45-38) in the last two weeks.
No. 10 Georgia (5-1, 3-1 SEC) 
looks to be the East’s best candi-date to reach the promised land of Atlanta, but the Bulldogs aren’t without their ﬂ  aws.
They dropped their ﬁ  rst con-ference game against the Gamecocks and barely squeaked by Tennessee two weeks later.
Plus the off-the-
ﬁ  eld issues surround-ing the Todd Gurley situation aren’t going to help them either.
Florida has the 
opportunity to reach Atlanta, but it’s margin for error is as slim as it could possibly be if it wants to 
sit at the top of the SEC East totem 
pole this season.
The Gators’ play has not been 
indicative of an SEC Champion in the slightest.
Sure they have two wins against 
opponents in the East, but they were last-second victories against Tennessee and Kentucky — both 
of which were on the easier side of 
Florida’s conference schedule.
And during the Gators’ two 
losses to Alabama and LSU — and even in its two wins, for that mat-ter — Florida’s play on both sides of the ball were riddled with in-consistencies.
Passes can’t continue to drop 
out of receivers’ hands.
Coverage miscommunications 
have to be avoided.
Third downs need to be con-
verted.
The Gators will need to win out 
the back half of its SEC schedule — a lineup that includes Missouri, Georgia, Vanderbilt and South Carolina — to reach its goal.
And, frankly, they won’t be 
able to do that if they continue the trends they have shown all sea-
son.If those problems aren’t ﬁ  xed 
and aren’t ﬁ  xed quickly, Florida 
will be in for a rude awakening throughout the next month.
So while the trip to Atlanta is 
still attainable, Florida has a long way to go before anything can be considered.
Everything is still in front of the 
Gators for now.
But one more mistake can 
change that in a heartbeat.

LUIS TORRES
Alligator Writer@LFTorresIII
There’s an old saying in life that says “fam-
ily is everything.”
For two Gainesville natives on the men’s 
and women’s golf teams, family plays an im-
portant role.
Senior J.D. Tomlinson has been a consis-
tent player on the men’s golf team as he enters his ﬁ  nal year this season. His sister, freshman Taylor Tomlinson has gotten a small taste of collegiate golf after participating in the ﬁ  rst two tournaments of the season.  
The Tomlinsons went to Oak Hall School 
in Gainesville — an independent, college pre-paratory school — and while they were at Oak 
Hall, they garnered a plethora of accolades.
For J.D., he was the Gainesville Sun’s 
Golfer of the Year three times and the 2011 
Gainesville Sun Male Athlete of the Year. Taylor was not too shabby in her prep career, too, as she was named the Gainesville Sun’s Women’s Golfer of the year in 2012 and 2013.    
Both were ranked in the top 10 by Golf-
week, and when it came time to choose their 
path for college, the Tomlinsons could not 
pass up the opportunity to stay home and play in front of their family.   “That’s a huge rea-
son why we’re both still in Gainesville,” J.D. said. “University of Florida is an unbelievable  experi-ence, growing up a Gator, but also having your family 
here was a big decision.”

The Tomlinson’s have been around golf 
since they were young.
Their parents are originally from southern 
Illinois and their father, J.D. Tomlinson II, was 
a golfer who decided to stay in town and play for Southern Illinois University.
And for as long as they can remember, 
their dad has been teaching them the game of golf.
“We grew up at Gainesville Country Club, 
so we’d go out with my dad in the evenings,” the fourth-year senior said. “He’d kind of teach us the fundamentals and we went from there.”
Being able to have their father at arm’s 
length to ask him questions, not only about 
golf but about life, was another reason stay-
ing close to home made sense for the Tomlin-sons.
“My dad helps me with my swing, and if I have a question I can just call him up,” J.D. said. “It’s nice having family here, it’s nice being close to your family and it just kind of in-tertwines all together.”   
For Taylor, not straying 
too far away from the peo-ple she admires most in her 
life was essential.
During her recruiting process, she wanted 
to stay in the south — the weather and being able to see her family were factors. It made committing to the University of Florida all the more important. She, like her brother, takes advantage of talking to her father about her 
golf game, but spending down time with her 
parents is equally as important.
“I can talk to him about my swing, or I can 
talk to my dad and just get advice,” Taylor said. “It’s always nice going back (home) on the weekends, either playing golf as a family on Sundays or just going for a meal.”

Families of student athletes have to be 
willing to make sacriﬁ  ces to see their children grow and become high level competitors. Some will set aside personal goals and gains just to have the opportunity to see their kids compete at the highest levels.  
For the Tomlinsons, it’s no different.  “It’s been incredible how they have put 
aside some things just to come see us,” Tay-lor said. “They’re always going to his tourna-ments to watch him and then coming to my tournaments to watch me…they’ve dedicated 
a lot just allowing us to have those opportuni-
ties.”
It is not only the parents of the Tomlin-
son’s that will come out to watch them play. Other immediate family members will go out of their way to support them.
“I think I could be the most supported 
Gator in the entire program. Basketball, foot-ball, anything,” J.D. said. “Because at almost 
every tournament, both of my parents come 
out. We have eight grandparents and I know every single one of them have come to mul-tiple tournaments, so we usually have at least two or three grandparents.
“I’ll have a great grandpa that will come 
out and watch, so they come to everything no matter what, if I’m playing terrible they’re still there, and it’s cool having that at every 
tournament.”
With the unwavering support from both 
their parents and grandparents, for the Tom-
linsons, family is everything.
Close to home: J.D., Taylor Tomlinson stay near family
