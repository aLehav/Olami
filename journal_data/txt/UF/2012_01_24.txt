Orange and blue face paint? 
Check. 
Foam ﬁ  nger? Check. 
Blue medical gloves? Check that 
one, too.
Thanks to a UF freshman, 500 
students will receive blue gloves when the doors open at 11 a.m. for Saturday’s men’s basketball game against Mississippi State Univer-sity. 
The gloves will amplify the wear-
ers’ applause and Gator chomps.
The idea came from Lucas Do-
lengowski, a 19-year-old telecom-munication major and avid sports fan.
He attended his ﬁ  rst Gators bas-
ketball game as a student last week, when the Gators beat Louisiana State University .  
The audience produced a lot 
of noise while the team played de-fense, he noticed, but not when it played offense.
He knew exactly how to im-
prove the spirit in the student sec-tion: gloves.
“The Rowdy Reptiles are a great 
student section, but it is our goal to make the O’Connell Center one of the toughest places to play in the nation,” said Alicia Longworth, a spokeswoman for the University Athletic Association, in an email.

Two suspects in the home invasion and 
killing of a 78-year-old Gainesville man are on suicide watch.
Alachua County Jail guards are closely 
monitoring Austin M. Jones, 22, and Ma-
randa J. Martin, 22, Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-man Art Forgey said Monday.
Under close supervision, the pair aren’t 
allowed to go outside or to bring as many possessions into their cells as other inmates are. Instead of the jail’s typical uniform, Jones and Martin must wear paper gowns.They were charged with attempted 
murder and home invasion with a weapon after breaking into Paul Quandt’s house at 4854 NW 75th Road late at night on Jan. 9. 
Quandt died a week later, when he was 
removed from life support by family mem-bers.
Jones and Martin have not been charged 
with murder because state prosecutors are Home invasion suspects on suicide watch

Some students and Gainesville 
residents could pay a little more 
for apartment living next year.
According to UF’s Off Cam-pus Life ofﬁ  ce, the average rent decreased over the last several years. However, that trend could be reversing, according to some complexes in town.
The average price a tenant paid 
for an all-inclusive four-bedroom apartment went from $580 each month to $420 each month over the last eight years, said Nora Kil-roy, Off Campus Life director.
A few years ago, the price of 
renting an apartment in town dropped for two reasons, she said.
The country entered an eco-nomic recession, she said, and at the same time, several new complexes were built, so supply increased while demand stayed about the same.
The Off Campus Life ofﬁ  ce 
collects rent prices from 10 to 
Local apartment rent may increase next year

Alaska woman, 85, uses shovel 
to fend off moose 
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — An 
85-year-old Alaska woman used 
a grain shovel to fend off an agi-tated moose that was stomping her husband.
George Murphy says his wife 
saved his life.
The Anchorage Daily News 
says the 82-year-old pilot, who flew for three decades for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, was hiking with his golden retrievers near the Willow airport Friday. He saw the moose and dove in the snow, but the moose started stomping him.
His wife, Dorothea, who is 5 
feet tall and weighs 97 pounds, grabbed a big shovel and hit the moose in the body and head.
She ran for help, and Murphy 
was rushed by medical helicopter to an Anchorage hospital. Mur-phy has a gash in his head but otherwise is in good condition.

Samuel B. Gause, 22, a chemistry graduate student, poses with his returned bike on          
Monday night.
TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
A UF student recovered his stolen bike 
Sunday night after coordinating a sting op-
eration with Gainesville Police.
Samuel B. Gause, 22, a chemistry grad-
uate student, realized early Sunday after -
noon that his black IRO Angus road bike wasn’t where he left it on Southwest Sec-ond Avenue two nights before, but after some Internet searching, he found it for sale on Craigslist. 
“When I first saw the ad and decided I 
was going to call him, I got a little jittery,” Gause said Monday . 
He set up a meeting with the bicycle’s 
supposed owner, not revealing that the bike was actually his. Then, Gause called police.
Collin D. Smith, 19, was arrested and 
charged with grand theft and dealing in stolen property by use of the Internet on Sunday night. He did not return a call re-questing comment.
Gause said he paid about $700 for the 
bicycle, and he checked Craigslist in the off-chance whoever stole it was trying to sell it online. He found an ad: “A great IRO one-speed bike — $200.”
The listing featured Smith’s phone 
number and three pictures of Gause’s bike.
He set up a meeting with Smith for 8:30 
p.m. at the McDonald’s on 1030 E Univer -sity Ave., and he brought a friend with him in case he needed backup. He called GPD about five minutes before arriving.
“I didn’t know who the guy was, wheth-
er he was violent or not,” Gause said. “It was a little nerve-racking. When we first got there, we couldn’t see the cops. I prob-ably shouldn’t have done it, but I did.”
Smith, who is 5 feet 6 inches, 140 pounds, 
was charged with battery and burglary last year, according to the Alachua County Clerk of Court.
Gause said he didn’t get a good look 
at Smith because he was trying to appear more interested in the bike than the sales-man.
After Gause examined the bike for about 
30 seconds, Officer Anton Lipski drove into the parking lot. Smith tried to run away but was caught, according to the arrest report.
Gause usually rides his bike two miles 
from his Creeks Edge condo to campus every day, but on Monday, he didn’t. He needs to buy a new lock.
Still, he’s not complaining. “I thought for sure I wasn’t getting it 
back,” he said.Bicycle bandit arrested  
after student sets up sting
“I had to step away and calm 
myself down before making the 
call.”

He trained for a 70.3 mile Iron Man triath-
lon, got shoes and clothes for all types of ter -
rain and downloaded audio versions of “War 
and Peace” and “Pride and Prejudice.”
All that’s left is to walk 3,475 miles of 
American soil.
On Jan. 28, UF alumnus Barrett Keene 
will start walking, stopping in major cities to spread awareness about and raise funds for orphaned and abandoned children. 
“The thing is, we have millions of children 
facing incredible, difficult conditions that we can and should help, and this is how we will do it,” Keene said.
Keene’s journey , called Go Walk America, 
will begin in Miami and continue through At-lanta, Nashville, St. Louis, Kansas City , Kan., Denver, Salt Lake City and Sacramento, end-ing in San Francisco.
While raising awareness for the world’s 
145 million orphaned and abandoned chil-dren, Keene said he also hopes to provide help. 
Partnering with The Global Orphan Proj-
ect, Go Walk America hopes to raise enough funds to  buy 25,000 school uniforms to give to orphans and other children who cannot af-ford them, he said. 
In some communities in Africa and Haiti, 
children can’t go to school unless they have a uniform. The funds Keene raises, in addition to buy-
ing uniforms, will help build sewing factories, which will create jobs, according to Go Walk America’s website.
Keene has worked with orphans and aban-doned children before. Trips to Panama, Gua-temala and Brazil gave him firsthand experi-ence, which, he said, is the most important aspect of helping. 
“Get dirty and go visit, then do something 
about it,” Keene said.
To prepare for his journey , Keene walks 
an average of 10 miles a day. Brooks Run-ning Shoes donated the $2,500 of gear he will need. 
Along the way, friends will take turns 
driving the support car that follows him. 
UF and Cornell University, where Keene 
is pursuing his doctorate, will track his prog-ress.
“The impact is big, far more reaching than 
just having clothes to go to school,” said Joy Goodwin, UF doctoral student in agricultural education and communications.
Goodwin is the graduate adviser for the 
Agriculture Communicators and Leaders for Tomorrow club at UF, and she caught wind of Keene’s journey through an email from the faculty adviser. 
The students in the club will walk along-
side Keene from Ocala to Lake City. Keene should reach the area around Feb. 26, she said. Anyone in the area is encouraged to join.
“Barrett kept saying, ‘You know it’s not 
about walking across the United States; it’s about knowing that you can make a differ -
ence,’” Goodwin said. 4, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2012

� LAST YEAR’S SURVEY 
SHOWED AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS.
LORI PERRY
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County Coalition 
for the Homeless and Hungry Inc. 
will conduct its annual homeless survey today and Wednesday.
Last year, the survey showed 
homelessness in the county in-creased by 38 percent to 1,781 peo-ple. About 25 percent were younger than 18.
Theresa Lowe, director of the 
Gainesville/Alachua County Office on Homelessness, said it is impor -
tant to get an accurate count of the number of homeless people and their needs in order to increase pro-gram development and funding.
“We will be going out in the 
streets and trying to find as many people in Alachua County that are homeless so we can get a count,” Lowe said.  
The numbers are then reported 
to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Florida Department of Children and Families.
People are homeless if they live 
in anything other than permanent housing.  Some live in homeless shelters, in motels, with other fami-lies, on the streets or in the woods, Lowe said.
The 2011 study stated 45.1 per -
cent of those surveyed had a high school diploma or GED, 19.5 percent had some college experience and 8.1 percent had a college degree.
Arupa Freeman, Gainesville resi-
dent, said someone needs to take into account the homeless.
“They are scared, and they need 
friends,” she said.

� THE EXHIBIT COSTS 
$4.50 FOR STUDENTS.

The Florida Museum of Nat-
ural History has a new resident. 
She stands about 9 feet tall, and it would take a person about 17 steps to walk from her tail to her three horns. 
“She” is actually a triceratops 
horridus skeleton cast that will be a part of the museum’s new “Cruisin’ the Fossil Freeway” exhibit. The cast exhibit will feature 29 other fossils, 19 color prints and five murals.
There is a debate in the 
scientific community about whether the triceratops is a separate species or the juvenile of another type of dinosaur, the torosaurus.
The exhibit will feature the work of artist Ray Troll, who created the murals, and pale-ontologist Kirk Johnson. It runs from Feb. 4 to Sept. 3. Student tickets cost $4.50.   
The museum’s operations 
coordinator, Kurt Auffenberg, likes to refer to the complete skeleton cast as a “she,” al-though the sex is unknown.
The model was taken from 
storage and rolled onto a flat-bed truck with the help of nine people Monday . It was then driven about two miles from a warehouse to the museum.  
Before this trip, it was in the 
waiting room of an acute care center in Jacksonville.  
Physician and fossil enthusi-
ast Clifford Jeremiah previous-ly owned the cast and gave it to the museum when he retired.  However, the model was kept in storage for a couple years be-cause the museum did not have room for her, Auffenberg said. Dinosaur cast moves into

Bicyclists’ wallets may be get-
ting a little lighter, and not just 
because they’re saving on gas.
The UF Office of Sustainability 
implemented a citywide program called Bicycle Benefits in 2010 to encourage residents to bike to city restaurants and shops. Program participants can buy a $5 decal to stick on their bicycle helmets. The decal gives them discounts at participating businesses when shown at checkout.
The Gelato Company and The 
8th Ave Bike and Coffee House are the newest additions to the list of Gainesville businesses. Both joined in December.
The Gelato Company offers 
25 percent off purchases with a decal, and The 8th Ave Bike and Coffee House offers 35 percent off bicycle servicing.
Joseph Floyd, a Gainesville 
resident, said he has saved $30 through the program over the past two months.
“And as they continue to add 
new businesses to the lineup, I’m sure the value to me will continue to grow,” he said.
Stephanie Sims, the Office of 
Sustainability implementation coordinator, said there are plenty of other benefits to participating in the program.
“Gainesville is a very bike-
friendly community, so we want to definitely encourage people to get out and get active and to avoid using their cars whenever possible to be more sustainable,” she said.City program offers

Families and students from different cul-
tures celebrated the Chinese New Year with 
singing, dancing and music on Sunday night.
The Chinese zodiac’s Year of the Dragon began Monday . 
On the eve of the holiday, dancers spun 
umbrellas and waved ribbons, and ballerinas in hot pink and blue tutus glided across the stage at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.About 600 people attended the event, which 
was sponsored by the Friendship Association of Chinese Students and Scholars. 
Some Chinese New Year traditions include 
shooting off fireworks at midnight, hanging the Chinese character “fu,” which represents good luck and blessings, and eating dinner with family, said Qiushi Li, a philosophy sophomore.  
Since he couldn’t participate in his family’s Chinese traditions this year, Li celebrated the New Year his own way.
“I went to Bento,” he said. Lesa Boykin, UF residence director, said 
she likes going to the Chinese New Year cel-ebration because she can interact with people from all cultures. 
“It’s most important to support each other, 
especially because it’s their most important holiday,” she said. Students celebrate Chinese New Year at Phillips Center

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Is your rent going up next year?
Monday’s question: Do you use on-cam-
pus tutoring? 
57 TOTAL VOTES11% YES
89% NOWhistle-blowers do not compromise security 
Despite former President John F. Kennedy’s adage, the 
sole justification for laws is to benefit and protect the citizens they govern. Each person, valuable within 
himself, is what our government was created to uphold. Any appeal to the benefit of “the Nation,” “the Economy” or “Society” forsakes its aim by failing to support the value of the very individual on which the laws were founded. 
On Dec. 23, Chinese pro-democratic activist Chen Wei 
was convicted of “inciting subversion of state power” in communist China. Wei has written a number of essays, ex-clusively published by foreign websites, that call for political and social freedom in his country . For his activism, he was sentenced to nine years in prison with an additional two years of political rights revoked. 
Across the Pacific, a similar case is underway in our 
constitutional republic. The military officer who presided over the hearing of Pvt. Bradley Manning — the intelli-gence analyst who supplied tens of thousands of classified documents to the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks — has recommended Manning face court-martial. With this recom-mendation, Manning moves one step closer to potential life imprisonment. 
It’s unclear whether Wei, who insists his actions are pro-
tected under the Chinese constitution, did anything techni-cally illegal; however, Manning undoubtedly broke Ameri-can laws, by adding unauthorized software to a classified computer, among other things. But the relevant question has yet to be asked: At what cost and to what benefit were Manning’s acts performed? 
Prosecutors have argued that Manning’s actions put 
American security at risk, “aiding the enemy” by indirectly providing al-Qaida with classified documents. Yet many of these documents contained data that compromised Ameri-can integrity — not security — such as the video of a careless and unsettling helicopter strike that left 11 Afghan citizens dead. With this insight, the acts of Manning and WikiLeaks have an obvious and honorable intent: to counter rampant governmental concealment in an effort to promote transparency and the awareness of citizens. 
In releasing classified docu-
ments, neither Manning nor WikiLeaks intended to support terrorist organizations, just as Wei, in writing anti-communist propaganda, does not intend to 
affront the Chinese people. Rather, these whistle-blowers and activists seek to aid the citizens of their respective coun-tries. 
They question and undermine the apparent authority, se-
crecy and unaccountability that their governments exercise. These governments, in prosecuting the individuals who dis-close their transgressions, act out of strict self-interest, not the interest of the citizens whom the administration is meant to serve. I recognize and acknowledge Manning’s wrong-doings and do not consider him altogether unaccountable. Unfortunately, WikiLeaks temporarily published the identi-ties of a number of Afghan informants, leading to terrorist retaliation. 
Yet, despite these failures of foresight, the main costs are 
primarily associated with the governments and political fig-ures whose integrity has been undercut by the revelation of their misconduct. Their corruption and backroom dealings have been exposed, and they seek to reprimand those who have laid them bare. However, the safety of American citi-zens has yet to be compromised; no terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens have occurred due to the leakage of classified information. In fact, it’s reasonable to say that the increased transparency and heightened consciousness has benefited global citizens immensely. Yet our government still persists with the implication that U.S. citizens are at the service of their country, not vice versa.

Airport security showing 
its absurdity
The Transportation Security Administration might as well 
be a four-letter word for people who have ever made a trip through the airport.
Recently, the TSA has groped a 6-year-old girl, required a 
95-year-old woman with leukemia to remove her adult diaper for a pat down, told a 17-year-old girl that the design of a pistol on her purse was a federal offense and harassed a young man with special needs holding a plastic toy hammer on his way to Disney World. 
But what the TSA did on Monday takes the cake for stupid-
ity, incompetence and plain absurdity.
Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the son of the  Republican presi-
dential candidate, was passing through a Nashville airport on his way to give a speech at the Right to Life March in Wash-ington, D.C. When he went through a TSA scanner, an alarm sounded and the Senator was told he would need to receive a full-body pat down.  
According to Paul, when he refused to continue with the 
screening process, he was taken to a cubicle where he said he was detained by the TSA. 
TSA officials say he was not detained but escorted out of the 
area by law enforcement. But Paul said when he tried to leave the cubicle, a TSA official yelled, “Do not leave the cubicle!” He was also told that he could not use his cellphone when he tried to make a call, presumably to his staff, letting them know he would be late to his speech. 
Paul did not want to have a full-body pat down, asking of-
ficials if he could, instead, walk through the machine again. After almost two hours of back-and-forth with officials, Paul said he was allowed to walk through the machine again with-out any problem. 
Paul believes the machine does not just go off when it de-
tects something, but is also being used as a mechanism to ran-domly pick customers for more in-depth screenings. 
If that is the case, what do these random screenings do but 
create a long, arduous security process that results in more vio-lations of privacy than security risks averted? This is not to say that we advocate any sort of discrimination in the screening process, but surely there must be a more effective way to high-light possible security risks than groping senators and grand-mothers. 
Also, if Paul’s story about being detained by the TSA is cor -
rect, are we seriously not allowed to use a cellphone to call our attorneys or families? This seems like an extreme overreach of the TSA’s power and a dangerous attack on our rights. 
Chances are grandmothers, little children, senators and 
people with mental disabilities are not going to hijack an air -
plane. Why does the TSA need to waste resources on searching anyone and everyone? 
Airports or individual airlines know more about their secu-
rity needs than a bureaucracy run out of Washington. Perhaps we should look at creating a more decentralized transportation security system that creates innovative but less intrusive ways to police our skies.

While I couldn’t really figure out ex-
actly what Travis Hornsby was ad-vocating for or complaining about, 
the main thrust of his column on Monday — that poor people would be just fine if only the rich were allowed to hang onto their as-sets in totality — is just plain wrong. 
I’m a third year law student at UF, and 
I’m dedicating my legal career to helping the impoverished gain access to justice. I also went to UF for undergrad and had the pleasure of serving as editor-in-chief of the Alligator in 2009. During my time in charge, I received  countless letters stating, “I can’t believe the Alligator would run this gar -
bage” and took it personally every time. Don’t worry, I’m not criticizing the paper for running this column. I just think it’s im-portant for readers to know that Hornsby’s claims have no basis in fact.
Poverty is a huge problem in America. 
The 2010 Census data show us that 46.2 mil-lion Americans are in poverty, the highest poverty rate since the government started measuring in the 1950s. Twenty-two per -
cent of American children are growing up in poverty. That’s nearly one in four. Over the years, there’s been an explosion in corporate growth to accompany the explosion in the poverty rate. It is not the children of hedge-fund managers or venture capitalists who live five to a bedroom in a crumbling inner city housing project and only get fed when school is in session. 
Probably the most rage-provoking claim  
Hornsby makes for those who, frankly, give a shit about poor people is, “Those demand-ing living wages for the poor would be hap-py to know that the vast majority of the im-poverished make higher than the minimum wage.” This is a bald-faced lie. Hornsby would have realized this had he performed even the most cursory check of any census statistics, and that’s pretty ironic since he’s a statistics major. 
If we look to the poverty guidelines, 
it’s evident that not only the “vast major -
ity” but, in fact, every single person under the poverty line brings home less than the minimum wage. The system is designed that way. The minimum wage is based on the poverty threshold, and those earning less than that wage naturally fall below. The 46.2 million women, men and children poor enough to qualify for government benefits are all living on less than minimum wage. I have no idea where Hornsby got his data to back up his contention, but it is simply not the truth. 
But even those lucky enough to be em-
ployed in minimum-wage, full-time posi-tions don’t earn enough for their families to live on. That’s where the idea of a liv-ing wage comes from, and it’s really a very simple concept. The United States is one of the most afflu-ent countries in the world. Despite that 
reality, millions of people here are home-less and hungry without the bare necessities needed to subsist from day to day. 
The Poverty Guideline used by the fed-
eral and state governments to determine eligibility for public benefits is an absolute, rather than relative, measure. This means that, rather than take into account what peo-ple actually need to survive, the government started with an arbitrary number based on a single agency’s recommendation in 1964. The process to increase that threshold to ac-count for everyday realities such as inflation and rising costs, along with the process to increase the minimum wage (directly tied to the poverty threshold), is convoluted and almost impossible to navigate. 
The government designed it that way. 
Poor people are not a politically popular group in American society, nor do the poor traditionally wield any significant political power to change their plight. Our democracy is structured in a way that stifles the voices of those at the bottom. The elderly, military veterans and the disabled fare slightly bet-ter in having their needs met by the govern-ment because they are considered “deserv-ing” poor. But the others — the 26.2 million people who simply cannot make ends meet in society despite their best efforts — are swept aside. Their needs are ignored by a system that does nothing to alleviate their plight.
In the eyes of the law, corporations are 
people. They have certain rights and free-doms, and the government can’t just step in and change things willy-nilly. Those laws that do exist to curb corporate power, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, came about in the wake of multi-billion-dollar widespread corporate scandal (remember Enron, any-body?). The government has made clear that it lacks the power to end some of the practices Hornsby points to, such as wide-spread outsourcing and other consequences of globalization that further aggravate the problem of poverty. 
But I fail to understand how these prac-
tices are necessary consequences of helping the poor. The problem of poverty does not lie in corporate greed as much as the solu-tion can’t be found in the alphabet soup of government bureaucracy. The solution lies in the hands of the American people, and until we stand up for each other instead of turning the other cheek, nothing will get any better.

Columnist wrong for claiming capitalism can cure povertyGuest column

Speaking Out
Last week, Yahoo Education released a story titled “Col-
lege Majors That Are Useless.” I have seen many simi-lar lists based on salary and expected job openings.
I was not particularly surprised by the majors this list 
named (horticulture, animal science, theater, fashion design and agriculture). However, something about this article got students on Facebook really fired up.
Perhaps it was the use of the word “useless” in the title. 
Useless? Surely Yahoo isn’t endorsing the notion that any college degree can be useless?
It can’t be denied that certain areas of expertise yield a 
higher pay rate than others, but to have a degree of any kind is not only recommended to the millennial generation, it is also becoming increasingly necessary.
I could easily produce a lengthy explanation as to why 
any of the majors Yahoo listed supply a number of tools us-able in any workforce, but I won’t insult your intelligence. Any reasonable individual can deduce that a degree in ani-mal science could assist with everyday life in a number of ways.
No, this argument is shallow, and 
it does not accurately represent the message I wish to send. A diploma is a diploma, and no matter what the 
degree is in, the graduate will have obtained skills usable in many environments.
The offense lies not in the idea that any given degree is 
less practical than another. This is simply a fact. For instance, everything about acting is impractical, but that is arguably a reason to delight in it. This brings me to my point. I be-lieve that practicality is far less urgent than the happiness obtained from chasing your passion. In other words, do you really want to drag yourself to classes you hate in prepara-tion for a job you will despise?
It is hard for many of us to consider placing happiness 
over frugality. There are times when I wonder if they are one in the same.
Money and employment have been presented as abso-lute top priorities our entire lives. Many of us have watched our parents put in extra hours to keep the water running, and yeah, being hungry isn’t exactly an awesome sensation. Money is comfortable. Most of us are not used to being with-out money, and such a state would cause discomfort. You would be lying to yourself if you expect to become an instant success at anything, especially in a highly competitive field like acting.
I’m not a mystic. I don’t believe in callings. I do, however, 
believe that everyone was born with a biological aptitude for success in a certain field. Call it what you will, but these talents help define us. They make us the beautifully distinct creatures we are. To deny yourself the chance to live pas-sionately because “it‘s not practical” is tragic. Have faith in yourself. Even if you don’t, believe your biology doesn’t lie.
Lose yourself in what you love, and remember that no 
degree is useless.

Martin used to work as a home 
aide for Quandt, and she knew he owned a safe, according to an arrest report. She and Jones brought rolls of tape, a stun gun and two pistols with them the night of the home invasion.When Quandt refused to give 
them the safe’s combination, he was beaten, his hands were taped and he was shot with the stun gun. Jones and Martin took the safe with more than $20,000 worth of gold, silver, firearms, currency and electronics in 
it and put it in the trunk of Quandt’s white Cadillac.
After the pair fled, Quandt used 
cooking oil to loosen the tape on his hands, and he managed to crawl to his scooter and tell a neighbor what hap-pened before slipping into a coma.
Police arrested Jones after a high-
speed chase ended in a three-car crash on Southwest 13th Street shortly after midnight on Jan. 10. Martin turned herself into police later that morning.8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, JANUARY 24, 2012

Annual rent increases are common among Gainesville apartment complexes, including The 
Courtyards, 1231 SW Third Ave., where residents could pay $20 more than this year.
Residents to pay about $20 more next year at several local complexes
16 apartment complexes every year around 
Spring Break and then calculates an average rent for the next year, she said. This average doesn’t include any incentives offered to new or returning tenants, she said, and after she collects the prices they rarely change.
Kilroy said her office hasn’t collected rent 
data for next year yet. But if rent does increase, it’s likely because the cost of maintenance has gone up for the complexes, she said.
At Looking Glass Apartments, rent will 
increase by about 3 percent next year, said co-owner Clay Kallman. Rent prices stayed the same for a few years after the recession began, he said, but last year the prices returned to their normal yearly increase.
Kallman said because Looking Glass is lo-
cally and family-owned, the company can re-spond more quickly to changes in the market.
“We don’t see the same kind of swings as 
other complexes,” he said.
Complexes also differ in what they include 
with rent. Some offer combinations of utilities, cable,  Internet, furniture and parking.At The Courtyards, residents signing new 
leases could pay $20 more each month than this year’s rate, said leasing consultant Nata-lia Neira. And at Royal Village, tenants will pay $16 to $20 more each month than what they pay now, said community assistant Da-vid Barrientos.
Two bedrooms at 2nd Avenue Centre, for -
merly known as Jefferson 2nd Avenue, will cost $20 more each month, said assistant man-ager Lauren Schaffer. This increase fits with current trends, she said.
The four-bedroom apartments there will 
cost about $70 more. Schaffer said this in-crease is more than usual because the complex wanted to be more competitive with others in the area.
At University House, the average price 
tenants currently pay for a two-bedroom is $655 each month, while four-bedroom apart-ments cost $524 each month, said community manager Christina Emanuele.
The market is recovering and rent prices 
are stabilizing, she said, so she doesn’t expect rent to change much for next year.

ment complexes in the Sorority Row area ac-cording to its website, declined to comment.ApArtmentS,

Students who don’t have a car can catch 
a free ride to vote this week. 
Early voting for the Republican Presi-
dential Preference Primary and Gainesville 
city elections will continue today and run until Saturday. Voters can cast their bal-lots at the Supervisor of Elections County Administration Building, the Tower Road Branch Library and the Millhopper Branch Library.
Free rides given by members of 
Gainesville Students for a Democratic So-ciety will leave from Plaza of the Ameri-cas between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m today until Friday. Students can sign up at the orga-nization’s table on the plaza at any time, said Michela Martinazzi, co-leader of Gainesville SDS. 
Once the club has a group of two or three 
people, a car will take them downtown to vote and bring them back to the plaza. 
UF College Democrats will give free 
rides to and and from downtown on Wednesday and Thursday. One car will be leaving from the Reitz Union parking loop at the start of every class period beginning at 10:40 a.m., said Erin Murphy, president of the club. 
Murphy, a 21-year-old environmental 
science senior, said she encourages stu-dents to sign up beforehand on the organi-zation’s website at ufdemocrats.org, but it is not required.  
“Students are Gainesville residents,” 
said Martinazzi, a 19-year-old art history sophomore. “They need to care about how the city is taking care of them.”

Reitz Union Board Entertainment will feature the only 
Florida premiere of a documentary about the media’s por -
trayal of women.
“Miss Representation” will play at 8 p.m. tonight in 
the Reitz Union Auditorium. UF’s Women’s Student As-
sociation, Student Government and Florida Opportunity Scholars are co-sponsoring the event.
The film is free and open to the public. Doors open at 7:30 p.m.
Aired on the Oprah Winfrey Network and praised by 
critics, “Miss Representation” will explore the American media’s portrayal of influential women, according to the RUB website.
RUB Entertainment and SG’s Women’s Affairs Cabi-net covered the $325 cost for the rights to the film, said 22-year-old graduate student Sky Georges, who orga-nized the screening with classmates from the Master of Sustainable Development Practice program. 
Kathy Keeter, a 20-year-old political science, Span-
ish and women’s studies junior and president of the UF Women’s Student Association, said the screening will help bring awareness to some of the issues women face and also project the group’s mission.

sound and look good, she said.
The gloves, which were ordered from 
a local company, are not latex, Longworth said. 
She did not answer an emailed question 
asking how much the gloves cost.
Dolengowski and his friends livened 
up two basketball games for their Orlan-do high school’s team by wearing gloves, which made their clapping louder. One of Dolengowski’s friends came up with the original idea, and the group pulled on their gloves for the state championship.
Dolengowski decided to bring it with 
him to UF.
“We had about 50 people doing it in my 
high school [gym],” he said. “But to have like 500 people do it… That’s going to sound awesome.”
At the encouragement of 23-year-old 
fifth-year electrical and computer engineer -
ing student Jake Sillick, who tweets about UF basketball as RowdyTownMayor, Do-lengowski contacted UF’s promotions de-partment. 
“We all agreed it was unique and would 
give it a try,” Longworth said.
Dolengowski isn’t the first person to 
stumble upon this idea. 
Utah State University gave gloves to its 
student section at last season’s final men’s basketball game.
Still, Dolengowski said he’s a little wor -
ried that fans won’t understand the point.
Dolengowski has used Twitter and Face-
book to spread the word to fans who may be skeptical.

UF’s College of Journalism and Communi-
cations announced Thursday that a new mas-
ter’s program will start taking students during Summer B.
The Master of Arts degree in mass com-
munication with an emphasis on multimedia journalism is designed to teach graduate stu-dents how to work in a new age of commu-nications.
“We try to get ahead of the curve in many 
different areas,” said Wayne Wanta, journal-ism department chairman. “We teach commu-nication skills used in different fields.”
The journalism school already has 200 stu-dents in its 11 graduate programs, according to the college website. The master’s programs are each focused on either research or practi-cal experience. This new program is a practical program, Wanta said.
“This made a lot of sense. It’s our philoso-
phy , but this is the first real application of it,” said Johanna Cleary, associate professor in the department of telecommunication. “News or -
ganizations expect journalists to be multifac-eted with their skills.”
Cleary and journalism professor Cory Arm-
strong created the new program’s curriculum. 
The college is also building a convergence 
newsroom, which is scheduled to be complet-ed by Fall 2012. 
About 10 to 20 students are expected to start the master’s program this summer, Cleary said. They are scheduled to graduate in spring of 2014. 
Katherine Kallergis, a 19-year-old journal-
ism sophomore, said she likes the idea of the program.
“I don’t think you can say you’re a success-
ful journalist by just being able to write,” she said. 
Kallergis, who said she is considering grad-uate school, said she believes students need to learn how to work for different platforms.
“It’s not an option,” she said. Cleary said the college will pay about 
$20,000 for the program. However, the tech-nology and supplies that money covers will also be used by undergraduate students. The students in the program will also use equip-ment from the convergence newsroom. 
Cleary said there is no exact figure for how 
much the new program costs, but it will be able to pay for itself in a short amount of time. That time will depend on the number of stu-dents who enroll in the program in the next few years, she said. 
The deadline to apply for the program is

Gov . Rick Scott questioned in 
October why taxpayers’ money 
should go to educate anthro-pologists when no jobs are avail-able for them. This semester, that money will be used to educate nearly the same amount of an-thropology majors at UF as last semester. 
There are 643 registered an-
thropology majors this semester. At the beginning of the fall  se-mester, there were 668, and in Spring 2011, there were 655.
“To have a difference of 12 
students [from Spring 2011 to Spring 2012], is not significant or particularly worrying,” said Susan deFrance, interim chair of the department of anthropol-ogy.
The slight decrease could be 
attributed to increased major re-quirements, deFrance said. Stu-dents are now required to main-tain a 2.5 GPA. They previously needed a 2.0.
Overall, enrollment in cours-
es in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences has gone down, so this decline in anthropology is consistent with the college, said Albert Matheny , the associate dean for student affairs.
Allysha Winburn, an anthro-
pology graduate student and human osteology teaching as-sociate, said she isn’t concerned about the slight drop in anthro-pology majors.
“If anything, I think my stu-
dents are more excited than ever,” she said.Anthropology major

UF researchers have developed a new gene 
therapy that could be used to treat a form of 
blindness.
The condition, called X-linked retinitis pig-
mentosa, is passed from mother to son and gradually deteriorates a person’s vision. The genetic defect appears early in life, so even though affected children are often born with sight, they progressively lose their vision.
To battle the condition, researchers devel-
oped a technique that involves replacing a faulty gene in the eye with a working copy that supplies a necessary protein to light-sensitive cells, which enables the eye to function, said study co-author Dr. William Hauswirth, a UF ophthalmology professor.
“The treatment has a promise to fundamen-
tally change their lives,“ Hauswirth said. “It’s hoped that they can restore a significant por -tion of their vision and live their life in a much more functional way.”
While women carry the trait, which affects 
about 10,000 people nationwide, they aren’t af-fected as often as males are, he said. He said less than one percent of the patients are women.
UF researchers worked with colleagues at the 
University of Pennsylvania to clone a working copy of the affected gene inside a virus, which 
served as a vehicle to transport the gene to the eye.
The treatment cured dogs 
that had the disease. The in-jected genes made their way only to the afflicted area of the eye.
Dr. Alfred Lewin, who is 
also a UF ophthalmology pro-fessor and co-author of the 
study, said learning how to treat the condition could help doctors discover new treatments for common conditions.
“We’re working on the rare diseases that are 
genetically understood,” Lewin said, “but if we can develop the technology with this disease, we might be able to come up with treatments for more common diseases.”New therapy may treat form of blindness

Students walking by the Hub 
today can learn about where the 
clothes on their backs and the food on their plates came from.
From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., visitors 
can walk through Monsanto’s America’s Farmers Mobile Experi-ence, an exhibit explaining today’s farming practices and technology.
The exhibit is free and takes 
about 10 minutes to walk through. 
Charlotte Emerson, director of 
student development and recruit-ment for the College of Agricultur -
al and Life Sciences, said UF didn’t pay anything to bring Monsanto’s exhibit to campus.
The exhibit opened Monday and 
attracted about 400 people within the first five hours, said Kera Rolan-do, a spokeswoman for Monsanto, a company that promotes, develops and educates people about sustain-able farming practices.
“It’s very important whenever 
we come to a college setting that students know how important ag-riculture is,” she said.
Today’s agriculture struggles 
to meet the demands of a growing human population, which is pre-dicted to reach 9.6 billion by 2050, she said.
Microbiology sophomore Anjali 
Shrestha, 19, said she learned about sustainable farming at the exhibit.
“A lot of people on campus 
don’t realize where their food comes from or the importance of what farmers do,” she said. “They just go to the grocery store and buy something cheap but don’t realize the work that was put into it.”Exhibit shows students

Orr Update
According to the Tampa Bay Times, defensive 
tackle Leon Orr has agreed to deferred prosecution on marijuana-related charges and will pay a fine or perform community service. Parsons Contributing for Houston
Rockets rookie forward Chandler Parsons has made an early impact after being drafted in the second round from UF. He is fourth on the team in rebounds and has already been featured on SportsCenter’s Top Plays multiple times to start the season.

Florida center Patric Young said the injured ankle that has limited his minutes recently is healthy enough 
for him to return to the starting lineup Thursday night against Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss. 
� GATORS AGAIN RANKED 
AMONG NATION’S TOP 15.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Even before coming to college, 
most of the Gators tried to build up 
a tolerance for playing games on short rest.
Junior center Patric Young said 
he once had six AAU games in one day during high school. Sophomore guard Scottie Wilbekin’s most in a 24-hour period is four.
Still, running through a mar -
athon-like day of summer league doesn’t really compare to the gaunt-let most Southeastern Conference teams have experienced since the league’s  TV deal with ESPN went into effect two years ago. There are now SEC games on ESPN five days per week, which creates scheduling concerns.
“It’s different, because in AAU 
the games are a little bit shorter, and the defense isn’t as good,” Young said. “You really don’t have to play defense in AAU, just get in that zone and sit in the back.”
UF coach Billy Donovan spoke 
Monday on the inconsistent SEC scheduling process that has Florida and Ole Miss playing two games in three days multiple times, while other teams like Auburn, Kentucky and LSU escape the regular season without ever having to play on one day of rest.
“My problem with it is if you 
want to get more teams in the NCAA tournament and you want to do more with your non-confer -
ence schedule, our league should not put teams at a disadvantage competitively,” Donovan said.
The Gators will begin two con-
secutive weeks of Thursday-Satur -
day games when they travel to play the Rebels at 7 p.m. on Thursday and then return home Saturday to take on Mississippi State at 1:30 p.m. 
Next week, Florida plays two 
home games against South Caro-lina and Vanderbilt.
“I heard the argument, ‘Well, it’s 
like that in the NCAA tournament. You’ve got to play Thursday-Satur -
day or Friday-Sunday.’ Great, but so does the other team you’re play-ing against. You know?” Donovan said. “That’s where we’ve got to try to figure out a better way to make it work.” 
Young Injury: After being left 
out of the starting lineup for the first time this season against South Carolina and LSU, the 6-foot-9 Young wanted to clear the air Mon-day that the tendinitis in his right ankle didn’t ruin another one of his streaks.
“I’ve never had a sprained ankle 
before,” Young said. “I don’t know; that’s God watching over me and protecting me from harm.”
While tendinitis does not qualify 
as an ankle sprain, the injury has still cut into his playing time re-cently. After a season-low 13-min-ute showing against the Game-cocks, Young played 24 minutes Saturday against LSU. He averaged Donovan questions SEC scheduling; Young injury update
STAFF REPORT
Florida added to its 2012 class Mon-
day with the commitment of three-star 
defensive end Alex McCalister. 
The 6-foot-7, 212-pound end has been 
told by coaches that he will line up at the Buck linebacker position currently played by Ronald Powell. McCalister is the sec-ond Buck candidate to commit in the past week, joining Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas defensive end Bryan Cox Jr. 
Florida pursued the position heavily 
after losing four-star end Jordan Jenkins to a Georgia oral commitment on Jan. 9.
Out of Clemmons (N.C.) West Forsyth, 
McCalister is also the fourth recruit from the state of North Carolina to commit to UF. Special teams coach D.J. Durkin was instrumental in recruiting McCalister, as well as five-star lineman D.J. Humphries, five-star defensive end Jonathan Bullard and linebacker Rhaheim Ledbetter.
Florida now has sev-
en commitments from defensive linemen. 
Muschamp’s first 
full class is ranked No. 4 nationally by Rivals.com. 
With several players 
already enrolled, Flor -
ida can sign more than

Experience was supposed to help push 
the Gators over the top.
Returning 10 players and five seniors 
from last year’s 20-win squad, Florida was 
prepared to compete for its first Southeast-ern Conference crown in school history, at least on paper.
However, in order to make a run at 
the top spot in the SEC, the Gators had to overcome their main problem from last season: losing close games.
Florida had nine defeats by single dig-
its during the 2010-11 campaign, includ-ing five blown double-digit leads in the second half.
“We were an NCAA Tournament team 
last year if you take away the games we just blew,” redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones said during the preseason.
“We can’t have an NCAA Tournament 
bid taken away from us this year. It’s our last chance, so I think with five seniors, it gets the message across to the entire Seasoned Gators still losing 
close conference games

Following the lacrosse program’s successful sophomore sea-
son, the Gators were looking forward to 100-percent continuity 
in their starting lineup.
They will have to settle for 11 out of 12.In December, junior midfielder Janine Hillier transferred to 
Stony Brook in New York, citing a desire to be closer to home as the impetus for the move.
A native of Farmingdale, N.Y., the move allows Hillier to re-
turn to Long Island and play for her sister, Kim, who is a first-year assistant on the Stony Brook staff.
“She wanted to get closer to home,” said UF head coach 
Amanda O’Leary. “You always want your players to be happy, and that’s something she felt like she needed to do, and if that made her happy, then great for her.”
After making her decision to transfer, Hillier released a state-
ment in which she made it clear she was leaving UF on good terms.
“I am extremely thankful and honored to have been a part of 
a great program led by the top coaches in the country,” she said in the statement. “I also am grateful to have had the opportunity to play with some of the best players in the country as well. I wish the team all the best of luck in the world!”
Hillier was part of the program’s inaugural top-ranked re-
cruiting class in 2009 that included 24 players. She was the team’s fourth-lead-ing scorer as a sophomore last season with 34 goals and six assists and was 
second on the team with 35 draw controls. Her play earned her American Lacrosse Conference Second Team honors.
“Janine was a fantastic player,” O’Leary said. “I think our 
program will move on, and we have moved on.”
The Gators’ incoming recruiting class was ranked third-
best in the nation, according to Inside Lacrosse Magazine, and O’Leary said some of the new players will be counted on to re-place Hillier’s production.
“We have some fantastic freshmen who have really stepped 
up,” O’Leary said. “Nicole Graziano. Nora Barry. And Shannon Gilroy is just coming off a knee injury … and she’s done a really nice job of stepping in.”
Gabi Wiegand, a junior transfer from Richmond, is another 
player O’Leary said will help fill the void left by Hillier. O’Leary said all of the players have the physical and technical skills to have an immediate impact.
“They are really speedy, and they’re quick, and they have 
good shot selection,” she said.
The starting lineup has not yet been set, and there is still 
open competition in practice. 
According to O’Leary, their performances Thursday in the 
Gators’ exhibition against England will help in determining the starting lineup for the regular season opener against North Carolina on Feb.11.UF looking for help 
after Hillier’s transfer Butler: Seniors must ‘take over this season’
team.”
While the Gators have been 
able to maintain late leads this sea-
son, their struggles in tight games continue.
Last season’s problem was 
starting well and finishing poorly, but Florida’s biggest flaw this sea-son has been stumbling out of the gate.
“(The problems) aren’t coming 
in the late-game situations, they’re coming earlier in the game,” coach Amanda Butler said. “In late-game (scenarios), we’re putting our-selves back in position to win.”
First-half offensive woes have 
crippled the Gators throughout the 2011-12 season, particularly in SEC play.
In four league losses, Florida has averaged 20.25 points and 13 turnovers in the first half.
Conversely, the Gators have 
posted average marks of 34 points and 6.3 giveaways before halftime in three SEC victories.
“Offensively, we just can’t give 
the ball back; our defense is play-ing as well as it possibly can,” Butler said. “You’ve got to put the ball in the hole and get the reward for playing such tough, stingy de-fense.”
Butler notes that duplicating 
game pressure in practice is diffi-cult, so she seeks other methods of combating Florida’s issues in tight contests.
“We work on special situations 
where we have the lead and we work on — in five minutes — of keeping that lead,” senior guard Deana Allen said.“Sometimes, we go for five min-
utes where we’re down and we try to catch back up. It’s still some-thing that we’re trying to perfect and get good at.”
One issue that has plagued 
Florida throughout this season has been inconsistent production from its senior class.
Jones ranks second on the team 
with 12.6 points per game, and Allen is the Gators’ second-lead-ing rebounder, pulling down 5.9 boards per contest.
However, the rest of the group 
has left something to be desired.
Center Azania Stewart and 
guard Lanita Bartley both saw their production dip once SEC play began and have lost their starting roles.
Forward Ndidi Madu has 
shown flashes of brilliance since replacing Stewart, but her overall performance has been inconsistent as well.
“The seniors are sitting in a dif-
ferent place than anyone else on the team,” Butler said. “Those guys have got to take over this season.”
Meanwhile, other players have 
stepped up to fill the leadership void.
Junior forward Jennifer George 
leads the team with 13.5 points and 9.8 rebounds while sopho-more guard Jaterra Bonds ranks third in scoring with 9.4 points per contest.
But when George struggles like 
she did in the LSU game and Bonds shoots as poorly as she did against Michigan, Florida needs the rein-forcements of a solid senior corps.
Reaching the Big Dance is some-
thing the Gators aspire to accom-plish, but Butler says they need to regain their confidence in order to move forward.
“The seniors really have got to 
push harder, find another level of intensity, find another level of per -
formance, and demand that from their teammates,” Butler said.
“If they collectively make that 
decision to just really dig in … then you’ll see some close wins as opposed to some close losses.”

When Florida defeated Baylor on Sun-
day, there was plenty of praise to go 
around. 
From a comeback win by Frank Carle-
ton to the straight-set clincher by Florent Diep, the No. 8 Gators played hard-fought matches against a fellow top-10 team. 
However, one of the most impressive 
victories of the afternoon came from Bil-ly Federhofer, a junior from Miami who played sixth in the Gators’ singles rota-tion. 
While his teammates played competitive 
matches, Federhofer dismantled his oppo-nent, taking down Baylor’s Kike Grangeiro 6-0, 6-1. The victory gave Florida a 2-0 lead, confidence and momentum.
“For Billy to get off the court so quick, 
so impressively, took a lot of pressure off of the other guys and was a huge factor in the match,” Florida coach Andy Jackson said.
In last year’s match against the Bears, 
which the Gators won 5-2, Federhofer took the loss against Grangeiro. The Baylor se-nior beat Federhofer 1-6, 7-6 (3), 1-0 (10-7). Grangeiro, who was ranked as high as No. 88 last year, posed little challenge in this year’s match.
“That kid had a very good season for 
Baylor last year,” Jackson said. “All the matches could have gone either way except for the match at six.”
Jackson raved about Federhofer, noting 
that to get a win from the No. 6 spot was a major testament to the team’s depth. 
“Michael Alford and Andrew Butz and 
Billy were guys that I considered playing at six,” he said. 
“All three guys being in contention like 
that makes us feel pretty good about our depth.”
For the Gators, hav-
ing Federhofer, Alford, and Butz available in that sixth slot will be crucial 
this season. 
Alford, a sophomore 
from Tampa, has already 
claimed his first singles title of the spring, winning the consolation bracket at the SEC Indoor Championships in Lexington, Ky. on Jan.15. 
A Vero Beach native, Butz turned in an impressive fall season, going 12-4 includ-ing a win over New Mexico’s No. 81 Jadon Phillips.
Butz and Federhofer both also played 
doubles against Baylor. Butz paired with junior Bob van Overbeek to win their match 8-5. Federhofer and senior Nassim Slilam also dispatched their opponents 8-5. 
The flexibility of eight viable options 
will be a major asset to the Gators with the season just beginning and the possibility of slumps and injuries always looming.
Looking to continue their strong start, 
Federhofer and the Gators will host the ITA Kick-Off event this weekend at Linder Stadium. They will face New Mexico on Saturday morning at 10, and will face the winner between Miami and Wake Forest on Sunday.

Coach Amanda Butler said the team’s seniors have to step up after 
several close losses have put their NCAA Tourney hopes in jeopardy.

games.
“I think he’s fine now. I don’t expect him 
to miss practice. He’s not complaining of any-thing. It could flare up,” Donovan said.
“There may be some discomfort in his 
foot, but certainly we’re never going to put any player in a position where they could further hurt themselves by being out on the court.”
Young said he feels ready to get back in 
the Gators’ starting lineup ahead of Thurs-day’s away game, but the decision will ulti-mately be made by Donovan.
With sophomore forward Will Yeguete 
starting in his place the last two weeks, Young said the one thing he has missed the most has been taking the opening tip — a responsibil-ity that has been delegated to junior forward Erik Murphy.
“Murph looks kind of awkward when 
he’s out there doing it; I’m not going to lie,” Young said. “I don’t think he knows how to stand the right way.”
Moving on up: Fresh off a 76-64 home win 
against LSU, the Gators climbed three spots to No. 14 in this week’s AP Top 25 poll.
As one of three SEC teams currently 
ranked, Florida (15-4, 3-1 SEC) had previ-ously tumbled down to No. 19 after opening league play with a loss to Tennessee but has rebounded in the last two weeks with three straight SEC wins. Mississippi State (16-4, 3-2 SEC), who UF 
plays on Saturday, checked in at No. 18, while No. 1 Kentucky (19-1, 5-0 SEC) assumed the top spot in the poll after No. 2 Syracuse lost its first game of the season to Notre Dame.
