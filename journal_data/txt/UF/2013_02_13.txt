Six Student Government candidates 
will have a war of words at the UF SG 
Debate today.
The debate, which is sponsored by the 
Freshman Leadership Council and co-sponsored by Hispanic Students Associa-tion and Black Students Union, will be at the University Auditorium. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the debate starts at 7 p.m.
Alyssa Nieves, the council’s vice chair-
woman for public relations, said this is the eighth time that the council has spon-sored the debate. In previous years, the multicultural organizations hosted their own debates.
The presidential, 
vice presidential and treasurer candidates from the Students Party and the Swamp Party will each address pre-determined questions. Students in attendance 
can tweet questions to 
the candidates before the debate begins with #UFSGDebate.
Nieves, a 21-year-old public relations 
junior, suggested that UF journalism pro-fessor Mike Foley should be the modera-tor of the debate because of his personal-ity.
“We don’t want students to feel like 
the political process is boring,” she said.
Foley agreed to moderate his ﬁ  rst SG 
debate. He said it’s important for students to know who is representing them.
“They ought to know what their rep-
resentatives look like, sound like and think,” Foley said.
The council’s special events director, 
21-year-old UF political science and eco-nomics junior Bryce Freeman, said it was a great opportunity for the student body to learn about the candidates without bias.
“Who we elect next week has a real 
impact on the University of Florida,” he said.

President Barack Obama 
praised the United States’ eco-
nomic progress in the last year and called for congressional action to boost job growth, strengthen the middle class and reduce the national deﬁ  cit during his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night in Washington, D.C.
Among his proposals, 
Obama called upon Congress to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour and change the current Higher Education Act to make college tuition more affordable for citizens.
When the news hit 
Gainesville, responses were mixed.
Rachel McGovern, a 20-year-
old political science junior and UF College Democrats vice president, said she supports Obama’s plan to cut the cost of tuition.
“I think making college more 
affordable is deﬁ  nitely pos-sible,” she said. “Higher educa-tion should not be a privilege only afforded to the rich.”
Katy Melchiorre, a 21-year-
old UF political science and telecommunication senior and UF College Republicans chair-woman, agreed the growing costs of college is a problem but said other solutions should be pursued as well.
“I think rather than having 
so much federal involvement in education, that students and families should have a better understanding of options other than college,” she said.
On raising the minimum 
State of the Union is strong, Obama says

UF was on a list released by 
the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration of the 81 public entities that applied for a license to use drones through October 2012.
Drones, which are un-
manned aircrafts, are capable of highly advanced surveillance that some people consider in-trusive, according to the Elec-tronic Frontier Foundation.
They carry surveillance 
equipment, video cameras, ther -
mal imaging, GPS tracking and cellphone eavesdropping tools. They can also be equipped with license plate cameras and facial recognition, according to the foundation’s website.
However, UF,  like other 
universities that have applied, use drones for research, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
Franklin Percival, program 
leader for the Florida Coopera-tive Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, said certificates of autho-rization last one year, and UF has several certificates in effect. 
Rebecca Jeschke, digital 
rights analyst for Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the foundation is most concerned with how law enforcement agencies will use drones, but it does understand the benefits of drone use in university re-search. 
UF uses the technology in 
support of ongoing aerospace, geomatics, ecological and aquatic research, according to records on the foundation’s website.
The UF Department of Aerospace and Mechanical En-gineering’s Micro Air V ehicles Laboratory , the UF School of Forest Resources and Conser -
vation’s Geomatics Program and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers work with the de-velopment of drones for a way to monitor natural resources in an affordable and user-friendly way , according to the UF/IFAS UAS research webpage.
Unmanned aircrafts can 
observe remote areas that lack runways, making dangerous areas less of a threat.
Percival said that, with low-
level manned aircrafts being the leading cause of work-related mortality for wildlife biologists, unmanned aircrafts could have a positive impact on safety.
“We are trying to come up 
with tools that improve our ability to do certain things,” he said. “And in this case it’s eval-uating wildlife habitats.”

� THE AUCTION WILL BE AT 
THE BACKYARD BAR.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville residents will put their 
wallets on the line for a chance to score 
a date this Valentine’s Day.
The fifth annual Valentine’s Singles 
Auction will begin at 11:30 p.m. at The Backyard Bar, 232 SE First St., between Boca Fiesta and Palomino Pool Hall.
Event coordinator Stephen Tierney 
said that although the Facebook event has about 160 confirmed guests, he ex-pects more to attend. Those who sign up to be auctioned off will be called on stage, have a brief description about themselves read and be sold to the highest bidder.
“It’s hilarious to see people go up 
on stage,” Tierney said. “Some are nervous, some are jumping around and some are even taking off their clothes.”The entrance fee will range from $3 
to $5, and bidding will start at $1.
Disc jockey Cameron Burris partici-
pated as a bachelor in the past. He said the bidding prices for dates usually aren’t steep.
“Bidding for a date isn’t that expen-
sive,” he said. “But it has gone as high as about $140 for a bachelor.”
After the auction, participants will 
have their names entered into a raffle for a chance to win date nights spon-sored by local restaurants.
The money raised from the auction 
will be split between the Civic Me-dia Center and the Lynnae Hottinger Foundation for Ovarian Cancer Re-search.
Jessie Erickson, a 22-year-old UF 
public relations senior, will be auc-tioned off at the event. She said she has high hopes for a light-hearted night full of fun.
“I hope I get a sexy , tall, dark and 
handsome man as my highest bidder,” she said. “Who knows, I may meet the man of my dreams.”Singles to be sold tonight
“We are trying to 
come up with tools that 
improve our ability to do 
certain things.”
Franklin Percival
program leader for the Florida 
Cooperative Fish and Wildlife 
Research Unitdoor. People are always trying to 
come in and pick up flowers.”
Stanley said the store’s best-
selling products are roses. The store ordered about 5,000 roses to meet this year’s demands.
During the season of love, 
Stanley said, UF students account for a large portion of the store’s business.
“We get quite a few students 
over here,” she said. “We get people calling in and ordering over the phone. We deliver a lot to campus and the [apartment] complexes around here.”
Meanwhile downtown, Nata-
lie Suwanprakorn is preparing chocolate treats at her one-person operation, Armadillo Chocolates.
Although she works alone, Su-
wanprakorn, 36, had to squeeze some seasonal help into her 100-square-foot kitchen in time for Thursday. The extra hands, she said, will package and de-liver. 
She hopes her products, a 
nine-piece vegan chocolate box and chocolate-dipped strawber -
ries, will be a hit at local stores this Thursday.
“I’ve made a really sincere ef-
fort to make these chocolates for Valentine’s Day really special with the flavors and the ingre-dients from local farmers,” she said.
Another source for Valentine’s 
Day goodies is KB Kakes in Ala-chua.
Erika Ashley, the general man-
ager of KB Kakes, has worked with her mother, the owner and operator of the business, for sev-eral years.
She said the demand for their best-selling product only increas-es near Valentine’s Day.
“We’ve had the gourmet cake 
truffles at Dorn’s [Liquors and Wine Warehouse] for four years now, and they’re incredibly pop-ular,” Ashley said.
Ashley said her store doesn’t 
put out special products near Val-entine’s Day. But she said they’ve made more of their signature cake truffle flavors: dark chocolate, birthday cake and strawberry cheesecake.
Along with the traditional 
Valentine’s Day gift sources, a mother-daughter duo offers a lo-cal option.
On the corner of Northwest 
Third Avenue and Northwest 13th Street stand Michelle John and her 20-year-old daughter, Sarah. John, 40, and her daughter run a roadside stand of Valen-tine’s Day-themed products from their truck. 
On Tuesday, bags of roses, 
candy, stuffed animals and can-dles lined the truck bed. There were two customers Tuesday, John said.
Tuesday was John’s first day 
at the location, and she hopes that sales will improve in the days leading up to Valentine’s Day.
“It’s just convenient,” she said. 
“Instead of running around like a chicken with your head cut off, you can just get it all here.”
With the clock ticking down to 
Valentine’s Day, local store own-ers are bracing for the rush of last-minute orders today. 
Stanley said her store is going 
to be ready.
“The phone’s going to be ring-
ing off the hook,” she said.
wage, McGovern said she was 
confident in Obama’s plan to make living costs more afford-able for citizens.
“The president is commit-
ted to making sure that work-ing families can put food on the table,” she said.
Melchiorre, however, disap-
proved of Obama’s proposal and said raising the minimum wage would have a negative effect on the economy , which could cause increased business costs and fewer job opportuni-ties.
“This would especially be 
true for small businesses,” she said.
Michael Martinez, chairman 
of UF’s political science depart-ment, called the president’s list of proposals ambitious.
He said political pressure 
could have factored into the number of proposals Obama presented, which touched on subjects that ranged from tax reform to gun control.
“He’s got to lay out what he 
thinks he will get accomplished in his next term because the midterm elections will loom starting this time in 2014,” he said.
Martinez said some mea-
sures, such as raising minimum wage, catered to a Democratic Party base, but others were more feasible for bipartisan co-operation.
“Some of the gun control 
measures, such as full back-ground checks, were doable,” he said.
With his minimum wage 
raise proposal, Obama said full-time workers who earn minimum wage earn about $14,500 a year. Raising it, he said, would better tie wages to the rising cost of living.
“This single step would 
raise the incomes of millions of working families,” Obama said. “For businesses across the country, it would mean custom-ers with more money in their pockets.”
Obama said the amendment 
to the the Higher Education Act would mean more access to the necessary education and train-ing for future employment. 
Obama also announced 
what he called a “college score-card.” The tool, released today , will rank colleges by best value to help families make informed financial decisions for higher education.
In the last year, more than 6 
million new jobs were created, he said, and people are buying more American-made cars and less foreign oil.
Obama also announced his 
plan to end the war in Afghani-stan and bring home 34,000 soldiers by the end of 2014. He said domestic programs such as Medicare should not be scrapped.
“We can’t just cut our way 
to prosperity,” he said.

Student Nighttime Auxil-
iary Patrol vans are now one 
step closer to serving one more block.
The Student Senate unani-
mously passed a resolution in support of Nightlife Naviga-tors’ “One More Block” cam-paign initiative Tuesday night.
With sufficient student sup-
port and the green light from UF’s administration, SNAP vans will drive one block north of University Avenue from Northwest 13th Street to Northwest 20th Terrace. The area includes UF Hillel, Emer -
son Hall, Classroom Building 105, St. Augustine Catholic Church and three fraternity houses.
Sen. Kelly Vidal, who au-
thored the resolution, is the vice chair of outreach for Nightlife Navigators.
“The whole point is to in-crease SNAP’s outreach to stu-dents,” she said.
Vidal said Nightlife Navi-
gators will try to rouse student support for the initiative. She said the agency plans to collect student signatures for petitions on the Reitz Union Colonnade and Turlington Plaza. The group will also meet with oth-er student organizations like sororities and the Cicerones for support.
Vidal said she has a personal 
goal to have the initiative pass by the end of the semester.
Liability , she said, is the 
administration’s main concern for expanding SNAP service off campus.
Nightlife Navigators chief 
of staff Chris Ceresa thanked the Senate for passing the reso-lution.
“We feel like a lot of stu-
dents use that block at night,” he said.

Sharks have never had the best 
reputation. “Jaws,” “Open Water” 
and “Shark Attack” are a few of the most popularized interactions of sharks and humans.
UF released Monday its Interna-
tional Shark Attack File annual re-port, which showed an increase in attacks from 2011 to 2012, with 53 at-tacks in the United States. About half of the attacks in the U.S. took place in Florida.George Burgess, director of the 
Florida program for shark research, 
said 26 shark at-tacks was a nor -
mal amount for Florida, but the number of attacks in the country 
was higher than it has been in about 10 years.
He cited the 
numbers in the U.S. as an oddity . He attributed the Florida numbers to very active ocean involvement, especially because of tourists and an expansive coastline.
“If you stretched out Florida’s 
coastline, it’d reach to New Eng-land,” Burgess said.
The abundance of tourism in 
Florida means more people in the water flooding sharks out of their environment, he said.
UF mechanical engineering se-
nior and surfer Max Famiglietti, 22, said he will think more about sharks when he’s in the water. Although he’s seen sharks, he’s never been too scared of them, he said.

UF students with a taste for electronic music may be 
able to attend one of the largest electronic music festi-
vals in the world in March for $5 — and help a greater cause.
The UF chapter of Nourish International, a student-
run, nonprofit organization, is hosting a raffle with a prize of two tickets to the first weekend of Ultra Music Festival in Miami.
The winner of the raffle, which began in December, 
will be announced Friday, said Katie Faughnan, head director of UF’s Nourish chapter.
From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Thursday, students interested 
in purchasing raffle tickets can go to Turlington Plaza. They can also enter online by visiting the raffle’s Face-book page.
So far, the organization sold about 115 raffle tickets 
and raised about $575, said the 19-year-old economics and political science sophomore.
All of the raffle’s proceeds will go toward a sustain-
able development project to teach computer software to high school students in the Dominican Republic, said Amanda Arevalo, the organization’s ventures director.
Ultra’s coordinators donated the two tickets.“I think the amount I paid was fair, especially if I win 
the raffle. Those tickets are valued at $600,”said  Neir Benyamin, a 20-year-old UF industrial and systems en-gineering sophomore.UF organization to raffle off Ultra ticketsSTUDENT GOVERNMENT

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you have a Valentine?
56 TOTAL VOTES73% YES
27% NOTuesday’s question: Do you feel overly 
stressed?Domestic Violence: 
Stop tolerating it 
from celebrities
We don’t want to be as angry at Rihanna as we are, but 
we can’t help it.
Like, what right do we have to pry into or care 
about the personal lives of celebrities?
Does it affect us in any way? Does it change anything in our 
lives? No. We just can’t help but feel weirdly disappointed about the entire situation. Ladies can do anything they want to with their lives. Absolutely . But the reconnection between Rihanna and Chris Brown is unsettling.
“People — singers and otherwise — can date whomever they 
like,” Susan Milligan wrote in U.S. News. “They can forgive, despite all evidence of an ongoing threat of violence. And if a woman indeed becomes a victim of domestic violence, it is the fault of the attacker, not the woman.”
“I hate the idea of celebrities — particularly those in the arts 
or sports — being expected to serve as an example or role model for others,” Milligan continued. “And yet it makes me cringe to think of young women looking at Rihanna and Brown and deciding there’s something very hip about sticking by the man who beats the hell out of you.”
She put it very well. People don’t want to be labeled role 
models if they don’t consider themselves to be them, but some-times millions of people look up to you and scrutinize your ev-ery move. At that point, maybe take into consideration what sort of image you’re portraying.
“The larger risk now is that because millions of young girls 
and boys love the music of Chris Brown and think Charlie Sheen is hilarious, our media is giving celebrity men a free pass to abuse women,” Jennifer Siebel Newsom, CEO of MissRepresentation.org, said, according to the Washington Post.
“While we can’t change court decisions and whether or not 
these women take these men back into their lives, we do have a responsibility to use our voice to counter the media narratives which say abusing women is an acceptable norm,” Newsom said.
So, that’s what we’re doing now. We’d like to formally voice 
our concern. What we don’t know is where our concern should be placed. Is it with a society that teaches young boys to grow into abusers? Is it with a Hollywood elite who is thrust into the spotlight unwillingly, and then makes poor decisions? No.
It is with both of those areas. It is with the media in general for 
wanting to focus on the bright side of domestic abuse. The night of the Grammys, the “camera zeroed in on megastar Rihanna, smiling, intertwined with and resting her head on Chris Brown’s shoulder,” according to the Washington Post. “The snuggle fest began trending on Twitter with comments about how ‘in love’ and ‘phenomenal’ the couple looked together.”
“Demand that celebs play by the rules. Revoke the get out of 
jail free card. Don’t forget,” psychologist Tashion Macon wrote in an article for the Hufﬁ  ngton Post that listed, in more detail, the ways society can better itself. 
If we can get this new way of thinking off the ground — the 
idea that it’s not OK to humor celebrities who do bad things — then, maybe the next generations won’t be so confused.
UF’s Student Government needs an overhaul.  
The Swamp Party holds about three-quarters of 
the seats in the Student Senate, controls the executive 
branch, controls a multimillion-dollar budget and the fund-
ing for registered student organizations.
Whose crazy idea was this? Did no one see the potential 
for one party to gain absolute control of SG and its resourc-es? Did no one expect that once in power, students who be-longed to this party would try to do everything possible to maintain that power?
Last Spring, the Swamp — then Unite — Party showed 
its true colors.
On the ﬁ  rst day of elections, when the Alligator ran an 
endorsement for the Students Party from head football coach Will Muschamp, the Unite Party Senate President Pro Tem-pore Jason Tiemeier threw away copies of the Alligator.
OK, so, the Unite Party admitted that one of its members 
went rogue, misbehaved and should be castigated, but that he doesn’t represent the other members of the party, right?
Wrong.Not only did they deny Tiemeier’s involvement, but 
Unite Party ofﬁ  cials, including the Swamp Party’s current candidate for Student Body President, Christina Bonarrigo, argued that the Alligator fabricated the story . 
To make matters worse, the Unite Party candidate for Stu-
dent Body President at the time, Tj Villamil, posted a video on YouTube calling the Alligator racists and liars for report-ing the incident, accusations for which he’s never publicly apologized.
Tiemeier eventually apologized in a letter to the Alligator 
and conﬁ  rmed that Unite Party Senator Katie Waldman was with him during the incident.
Waldman remained silent during the ordeal. Unite Party 
leaders saw it ﬁ  t to award Waldman’s loyalty by appointing her to chairwoman of the allocations committee. Bonarrigo defended the appointment, arguing Waldman had no ethical obligation to come forward, even though Waldman sat on the ethics committee.
During the same election, a student told the Alligator that leaders in her sorority castigated her for posting a Facebook mes-sage that endorsed the Students Party.
The student also told the Alli-
gator that her sorority kept a board used to pressure members into voting for the Unite Party . 
This semester, an email sent by 
Leah Miller asked fraternity house 
“representatives to collect ‘I Voted’ stickers from everyone in their rosters and supply the party with a $250 check,” accord-ing to Alligator archives. 
All of this nonsense doesn’t even include election code 
revisions SG passed during the Summer that were so vague and restrictive that the UF Supreme Court struck them down.
The list of unethical practices, coercions and corruptions 
goes on.
The Swamp Party has grown accustomed to a way of 
doing things and will stop at nothing to ensure it wins each election. It claims the Students Party has done nothing for the students, glossing over the fact that a minority party has little to no chance to accomplish much of anything when the party in power blocks it at every turn.
If you’ve ever felt like it was time for change, now’s your 
chance to make it happen.
If you’ve ever felt that one group of students has too 
much power at UF, now’s your chance to change it. If you are a member of the Greek community and feel pressured to vote or support candidates with whom you disagree, now’s your chance to change it.
Most important, don’t feel pressured to vote against your 
conscience because no one, not even SG leaders, will know how you voted. It’s all anonymous.
Go ahead, bring back a sticker to put on a board — just 
don’t tell them you voted for the Students Party.

opinions@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
In a guest column in Tuesday’s Alligator, Santa Fe 
College student Thomas Ryan argued that more women should be pro-guns.
Based on his logic, because one out of every six 
American women is a victim of rape (attempted or oth-erwise), more women should buy guns to protect them-selves. 
I can’t understand how he arrived at this conclu-
sion.
I guess it’s easier to pressure women into arming 
themselves than it is to teach men to recognize consent and not, you know, rape people?
Obviously, his argument is hopelessly illogical.But, out of curiosity, I did some research and looked 
into the steps and costs for young women to obtain handguns.
Luckily, gun laws in the “Gunshine State” are notori-
ously lenient. According to the civil liberties section of www.About.com, Florida, unlike other states, does not require people who apply for a concealed-carry license to complete a state-certiﬁ  ed ﬁ  rearms training course. 
Applicants may take courses from private instruc-
tors or the National Riﬂ  e Association.
However, I’d rather be on the safe side.A state-certiﬁ  ed concealed weapons course costs 
$65.
But wait. I’m a beginner who has never shot anything 
other than a paintball gun. According to the Florida Firearms Training website, I should take a $150 prereq-uisite course.
After that, I’d take the $200 Ladies Only Advanced 
Concealed Carry course, because I’d prefer to have the best possible understanding of the deadly weapon I’m planning to carry.
Now that I have all of my prerequisites out of the 
way, I can apply for a license.
Florida gun laws require applicants to be at least 21 
years old and pay a $300 application fee. After my ap-plication is cleared, I’m free to buy my handgun and ac-cessories. According to www.besthandgunsforwomen.com, a prime handgun choice for women is the light-weight, compact Glock 19. 
I’d probably go to my hometown’s Gander Mountain 
sporting goods store to purchase mine. Luckily, accord-ing to its website, there’s a sale on Glock 19s: For a cool $500, I could buy my Glock.
I’d also need something to carry my gun in.On www.Amazon.com, I found the most adorable 
brown leather concealed-carry purse with a locking CCW gun compartment — only $90 and almost as good as Gucci.
So my total, including courses, registration and my weapons purchase, comes to $1,305, or half the cost of tuition for a Summer A/B semester at UF.
However, I’m only 20, so I 
can’t do any of this.
This is unfortunate, consider-
ing the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) 
states that 44 percent of victims are younger than 18. 
So, about half the women raped annually couldn’t 
carry guns anyway.
Besides, even if I did pay all that money to ensure I’d 
never fear a stranger in a dark parking lot, the chanc-es of being assaulted or raped by someone I know are much, much higher.
According to RAINN, 73 percent of rapes are com-
mitted by someone the victim knows. Of that, 38 per-cent of rapists were a friend or acquaintance, and 28 percent were an intimate acquaintance.
The predominant cultural belief that most rapists 
are masked strangers is a myth. Furthermore, a gun will not protect you if you are intoxicated or have been drugged.
The situation in which a gun would be useful in de-
fending against assault or rape is, unfortunately, rare.
Do you really think you could shoot someone you 
know — a guy a friend set you up with on a date, or a man who lives in your residence hall or apartment com-plex — if he tried to rape you?
Besides that, rapists are impossibly hard to pros-
ecute.
According to RAINN, out of every 100 rape cases, 
only three of the men accused will spend a single day in prison.
Ryan’s arguments, and others like his, are old and 
exhausting.  
Why should women be held responsible for not be-
ing raped? The pattern of victim-blaming associated with rape is unbelievable, and now a sensitive issue is being manipulated and politicized by pro-gun lunatics.
Handguns, lipstick knives, cat-shaped brass knuck-
les and pink cans of mace won’t protect women against rape in the long run.
Of course, we can speculate endlessly on how to re-
duce rape, but there’s no cut-and-dry solution.
We can talk about educating men on consent and 
generally being decent human beings, but one thing is certain: Adding guns to the equation will accomplish nothing.

opinions@alligator.org I watched the Grammys 
Sunday — not that anyone cares.
But if you ask me, it was 
gauche. LL Cool J reminded us why he should stick to body-building, or whatever makes him so muscular.
Taylor Swift reminded us 
why her exes probably would never ever want to get back together with her, either.
Chris Brown reminded us that you can beat the hell 
out of a woman and still get nominated for a Grammy four years later.
I don’t understand our culture’s morbid obsession 
with awful music. I don’t understand why we worship these stodgy , talentless clowns. I don’t understand how we listen to their disgusting lyrics and then rationally admire them, whether it’s by following them on Twitter or purchasing their songs on iTunes (or converting them from YouTube).
Sure, it isn’t all of them, but it’s most of them. Music 
is something that is subjective, and I understand that. In terms of taste, it differs from generation to generation, from society to society and even from race to race.
Like Obama’s view on gay marriage, it’s constantly 
evolving — which we can all be thankful for.
Soon, Fun. will disappear like the Jonas Brothers, 
Rihanna will be the next Whitney Houston and Drake will return to acting or high school, whichever comes ﬁ  rst.  
Without war, anti-war activists would have absolutely 
nothing to whine about, and I feel the same way about music: Without it, I would have nothing or nobody to make fun of.
Like I said earlier, music is relative, and therefore it’s 
impossible to deﬁ  ne what objectively sounds the best. 
For example, I could argue that Jimmy Page played 
the best guitar solo of all time in “Stairway to Heaven,” but somebody else may say that it was Jimi Hendrix’s solo in “All Along the Watchtower,” Eddie Van Halen’s in “Eruption” or neither of the three.               
But if there is something that we can all agree is the 
best, it’s this: the content of the lyrics. No one can deny that Bob Dylan, according to Rolling Stone readers, was the best songwriters of all time. Meanwhile, everyone can admit that the rap industry is characterized by some of the most inarticulate and unintelligible lyricists who con-fuse clever wordplay and humorous puns for childish metaphors and lay-z innuendos.  
I’ll be honest with you. I can’t stand rap. I believe that 
it is the most proﬂ  igate and ignoble profession of all.
Rappers spew ﬁ  lth and objectify women. They glorify 
violence and promote drug use. Paradoxically , they are the most outspoken about the War in Iraq and women’s rights — and so are their listeners.
There’s nothing that I enjoy more than the feminist 
who bops her head to sexist lyrics or the lefty who listens to ﬁ  lthy, untalented thugs. These are the same people who criticized Todd Akin because he said “legitimate rape” and chided Mitt Romney because he mentioned “binders full of women.”
If only Romney had sang it, featuring rapper Akin, then 
he would have been a potential nominee Sunday night at the Grammys. And maybe he would be our president.   
Their freedom to express themselves trumps the nega-
tive inﬂ  uence their songs have on teenagers and the col-lege-aged.
If we have the power to tax carbon monoxide emis-
sions or to socialize health care, then wouldn’t it make sense to regulate their morally repugnant verbiage by tacking on a surcharge every time they sing something obscene, or make some idiotic reference to the Illuminati — whatever that is.
I’m certainly joking, but imagine how many Planned 
Parenthood clinics would lose business if teenagers weren’t manipulated by disparaging, undereducated pigs who encouraged fans to sleep around, mistreat women and, uh, vote for the current president.
Does that make me out of touch?          Erik Skipper is an economics sophomore at UF . His column

Alligator Contributing Writer
A new study released this month 
showed that serving lower-calorie 
options is not only good for cus-tomers’ health, but it’s also good for business. 
With calorie counts now ap-
pearing in more restaurants, some Gainesville residents have noticed chains offering healthier options. 
Electra Posada, 45, left a local  
Cracker Barrel Tuesday afternoon with a grilled chicken sandwich for her son. 
For Posada, restaurants with 
healthier options help her and other families make sure they can watch what they eat. 
“I think it’s great that they have a 
low-cal menu,” she said. 
Fast-food and sit-down restau-
rant chains that serve more low-cal-orie foods had sales growth, increas-es in restaurant traffic and gains in overall restaurant servings, accord-ing to the study , which was released 
by the Hudson Institute.  
The study 
analyzed 21 res-taurant chains, in-cluding McDon-ald’s, Applebee’s, Cracker Barrel 
and Taco Bell. 
Restaurants 
that increased lower-calorie servings showed a 10 percent increase in total sales and a 10.9 percent increase in traffic since 2006.
Richard J. Lutz, J.C. Penney mar -
keting professor at UF, said he’s not surprised at the popularity of healthier options at restaurants. 
“People are generally more 
aware that calories make a differ -
ence,” he said.
Lutz said companies that put 
calorie information on their menus are pioneering a trend, will soon re-quired by all restaurants because of the Affordable Care Act. 
“This puts the information in 
front of the consumer that they wouldn’t know off the top of their head,” he said.
Jeanne Ludington, corporate 
communications manager for Cracker Barrel, said the restaurant wanted to make more healthy meals available to customers.
Along with cornbread muffins, 
chicken dumplings and biscuits, Ludington said, the restaurant has more fresh fruit and vegetable selec-tions such as fresh lettuce and baby greens. 
Cracker Barrel refreshed its salad 
selections during the summer be-cause customers generally eat light-er and healthier during the summer -
time, Ludington said. 
“We have a great interest in serv-
ing better-for-you offerings,” she said.Study shows

UF center Patric Young attempts a layup against UK center Nerlens Noel during 
the Gators’ 69-52 win against the Wildcats on Tuesday in the O’Connell Center.KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
During the past four 
years, Florida was 1-7 against 
Kentucky. But Tuesday night in the O’Connell Center was a different story for the Gators. 
No. 7 Florida (20-3, 10-1 
Southeastern Conference) defeated No. 25 Kentucky (17-7, 8-3 SEC) in a 69-52 blowout.
“It feels good to get a win 
against Kentucky because my whole experience play-ing against them I got a los-ing record,” center Patric Young said. “It’s nice to put a notch in the win column against them.”
Guard Mike Rosario got 
things started for Florida of-fensively. 
The redshirt senior made 
a layup to give the Gators a 5-4 lead with 15:40 left in the first half. Seventeen seconds later, Rosario added a three-pointer after a steal by senior guard Kenny Boynton.
Florida opened up the pe-
rimeter late in the first half. 
After Nerlens Noel was 
subbed out following his second foul with 6:26 re-maining in the first half, Florida made three straight from behind the arc. With the Wildcats’ leading shot-blocker benched, the Gators finished the half with a 71.4 three-point percentage and a 38-25 lead. 
“We just did a great job 
of moving the ball,” forward Casey Prather said. “We weren’t selfish at all. We were just trying to make our teammates better, and the guys that were open knocked down their shots.”
Young’s performance was 
the most impressive of the night. 
With forward Will Yeg-
uete, Florida’s leading re-bounder, recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, Young came up big for the Gators. 
He recorded five re-
bounds and three blocks in the first half and opened up offensively in the second half after a slow start.
Young recorded 12 points, 
11 boards, four blocks and a steal to earn his sixth double-double of the season and the 10th of his career.
 “We couldn’t get near the 
basket on Young,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said.  “He just physically took away the rim.”
Kentucky also had to 
play much of the second half without Noel. However, his absence resulted from some-thing more serious than foul trouble.
With 8:03 remaining in the 
game, Noel fell awkwardly after blocking Rosario on a fast break. Noel was carried off the court by his team-mates after suffering a left knee injury. He was taken to the hospital for further test-ing. 
“It would hurt for those 
guys to lose a player like that because he takes up so much room in the paint,” Rosario said.
“He switches teams’ phi-
losophy of how they’re go-ing to attack their defense. I just hope he’s all right.” 
While Florida’s 17-point 
win against Kentucky is the largest any team has posted against UK this season, Don-ovan  said UF needs to main-tain its focus in the midst of a long conference schedule.
“If you don’t come out 
and play well, there’s a good chance that you’re going to get beat,” Donovan said. “To stay at that mental and emotional high game in and game out is very, very diffi-cult. … We need to do that to become a good team.”

No. 7 Florida defeats No. 25 
Kentucky in blowout victory
men’S bASketbAll
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
With 1:54 remaining in the first half, for -
ward Casey Prather rose above the rest. 
Prather drove to the right lane and dunked 
over UK 7-footer Willie Cauley-Stein, capping 
a 16-4 run that put the Gators ahead by 15. 
The one-handed slam was the highlight of 
Prather’s night — a 12-point performance that helped No. 7 Florida (19-3, 9-1 Southeastern Conference) cruise by No. 25 Kentucky (17-7, 8-3 SEC) in a 69-52 victory Tuesday night in the O’Connell Center. “I was just trying to give the team a big en-
ergy boost,” Prather said. “I just like to help out the team any way I could.”
Said center Patric Young: “There’s just a lot 
of confidence with that guy . I know he can do that day in and day out. He’s just really ath-letic and has great, active hands.”
Missing junior Will Yeguete for the second 
straight game after he underwent surgery Fri-day to remove bone chips in his right knee, the Gators needed all the help they could get in the frontcourt against the Wildcats’ lanky big men.
In 23 minutes, Prather went 6 of 8 from the field. He scored eight points in the first half. The junior finished with three re-bounds, two blocks and two assists, playing on the low block for much of the night with forward Erik Murphy 
battling foul trouble.   
“I kind of like the chal-
lenge, because I’m not as 
strong as [Kentucky’s big men], tall as them,” Prather said. “I just took the challenge and tried to use my quickness.”
Prather checked into the contest with 17:19 remaining in the first half and set the tone im-mediately . He drew two charges against guard Archie Goodwin and center Nerlens Noel. 
“They were momentum-swinging charg-
es,” guard Scottie Wilbekin said. “When you can have a guy who’s willing to do that, it’s great. Obviously , with Will out, we’re missing some of that stuff.”
Prather added: “They were a big energy 
boost. I can tell my teammates were into it from there.”
Tuesday’s games was Prather’s second 
straight with 12 points. He finished with

Prather
5-of-9 shooting in 22 minutes during 
UF’s 83-58 win against Mississippi State on Saturday . This is the first time in Prather’s collegiate career he has scored in double figures in back-to-back games.
Prather has played five games since 
suffering a high left ankle sprain. He suffered the injury in a 74-52 victory against LSU on Jan. 12 and missed the next four games. The junior also suf-fered two concussions earlier this year.
In his first three contests since rejoin-
ing the rotation, Prather scored three points in 27 minutes. 
On Thursday , coach Billy Donovan 
said the team was not getting anything out of Prather. 
He added that Prather’s cutting and 
jumping were not up to the junior’s usual standards, attributing his down play to confidence issues and dimin-ished ankle strength. 
But after two strong games, Dono-
van has seen a change in Prather.
“This guy , he’s got two concussions, 
high ankle sprains. He’s just probably saying to himself, ‘What’s next?’” Don-ovan said.
“The thing that was encouraging 
was that he started to do things a little bit more recklessly and fearlessly . In the beginning, I think he was worried, ‘Is my ankle going to hold up? Is this going to hurt? Is this going to be a prob-lem?’ I think he’s moving past that.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2013

Kirsti Merritt stepped to the plate 
against Creighton’s Brittany Telecky 
with the Gators on the verge of run-ruling the Bluejays in Friday’s season opener. 
Senior Ensley Gammel had already 
driven in one run on a double and fresh-man Kelsey Stewart had drawn a walk. Merritt came up next with the bases loaded, and she drove the ball over the left-field fence for her first career homer.
“It was dreamlike,” Merritt said. “It 
just happened, and as I was running around the bases at full speed, I was like, ‘Oh, I can trot.’”
Merritt was the third Gator to hit 
a home run against the Bluejays. UF’s power surge against Creighton set the tone for the rest of the weekend. In their next four games, the Gators hit five more homers.
“Success isn’t surprising to me,” coach 
Tim Walton said. “It was fun watching.”
Stewart showed the most power over 
the weekend. She hit a three-run bomb against Creighton on Friday and a solo shot against No. 16 Arizona on Sunday.
“I didn’t even think it was going 
over,” Stewart said of her first home run. “I was just trying to get a triple.”
In addition to her home runs, Stewart 
also hit two doubles and a triple — the latter coming in her first college at-bat.
“I was super nervous,” Stewart said. 
“I looked at coach, and he was like, ‘Calm down.’ Then, I hit the triple, and I just re-laxed and started playing my game.”
On Monday, the freshman second 
baseman was named the Southeastern Conference Player of the Week.
Gammel and senior Kelsey Horton 
also picked up the first home runs of their final season at Florida during the weekend.
Horton’s home run came on a 3-2 
count in the opening game against Creighton, and it gave No. 5 Florida (5-0) a lead it would never relinquish.
Gammel’s bomb came during UF’s 
14-3 win against Arizona on Sunday.
“It was good (to get my first homer 
out of the way),” Gammel said. “Espe-cially because it was the first weekend of my senior year.”
Freshman first baseman Taylor 
Schwarz added two blasts during the weekend. The first was a two-run home run against then-No. 3 California.
“The home run against Cal was a 
clutch home run,” Walton said. “We needed that.”
Although Schwarz’s batting average 
is .182 after the first weekend of play, Walton said she would continue to start. He expects her bat to come around.
Schwarz’s second blast started Flori-
da’s six-run seventh inning against Ari-zona on Sunday. Gammel’s home run followed, but both would be topped by an even bigger blast.
Later in the inning, sophomore Bailey 
Castro came to the plate with the bases loaded and slammed her first home run of the season — a grand slam.
Florida plays Jacksonville (3-1) on the 
road tonight at 6. Walton is skeptical of the Gators’ ability to keep scoring via the long ball.
“Jacksonville is a tough place to play,” 
he said. “You’re down in a valley, so the ball doesn’t carry there very well.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

A year ago, Taylor McCord trotted onto  the 
field at  Dizney Stadium  in Florida’s home 
opener against Jacksonville. After transferring 
to JU following her freshman season at UF, Mc-
Cord will face the school that first gave her an 
opportunity.
The No. 3 Gators (1-0) will travel to Jack-
sonville to take on the Dolphins (1-1) tonight at 7. in the fourth meeting in as many years be-
tween the two teams.
Jacksonville is known for its high-powered 
offense, which finished first in the nation last year with 18.2 goals per game. However, those numbers have not translated into wins against Florida.
In three matches against the Gators, the Dol-
phins managed only 20 goals. UF has scored 48 in that span.
Jacksonville is coming off an impressive 
15-7 win against Vanderbilt during which the Dolphins scored 11 straight goals.
“This is a very, very good team, and one 
that’s not to be taken light-
ly,” Florida coach Amanda O’Leary said. “For us, I think it’s being able to stay com-posed, stick to the game plan. They have some great offen-sive players that are quick and fast.”
McCord shined against the 
Commodores, scoring two 
goals and tallying two assists. O’Leary said UF needs to keep tabs on McCord because her lefty presence will prove challenging for the Gators’ defense.
“Taylor was a great player, and she is go-
ing to continue to develop and become an even better player,” O’Leary said. “We are going to have to focus on her for sure.”
Nora Barry and Shannon Gilroy were Mc-
Cord’s roommates. All three  enrolled at Flori-da as part of the 2011 recruiting class.
Barry and Gilroy said seeing Taylor in an 
opposing jersey this year will be a difficult ad-justment.
“It will be a little strange playing against 
her, a little sad,” Barry said. “But I’m really glad that she is happy with her decision to go play at Jacksonville.”
Gilroy added: “Personally, I’m very excited 
because Taylor was one of my best friends. I’m so happy she was able to transfer there because she is so much happier and she has a really big impact on that team.”
Two other familiar faces Barry and Gilroy 
will recognize are Jacksonville coach Mindy McCord and assistant coach Paul McCord, bet-ter known by the UF sophomores as Taylor’s parents.
“I’m really excited to see her and her par -
ents, because we were really close,” Barry said.
The thought of competing against her for -
mer teammate on a draw or a groundball made Gilroy laugh.
“It would be comical to face off against her, 
because we are so close,” Gilroy said.Florida lacrosse

◗ UF SHOT A COMBINED 18 OVER PAR ON TUESDAY.
STAFF REPORT
After a successful first round in the Northrop Grumman 
Championship left Florida tied for second place, the Gators 
struggled in the second round, falling to fifth place after shooting a combined 302 (+18) on Tuesday.
Every Florida starter shot worse in the second round 
than in the first. Senior Mia Piccio posted the Gators’ worst mark, jumping from even par in Round 1 (71) to a 7 over par (78) in Round 2. 
Camilla Hedberg, the fifth-ranked player in the nation, 
remained tied for second after the second round despite shooting 1 over par (72).  
After falling to 24 over par, UF’s chances of winning its 
fourth tournament this season have slimmed. Hedberg has the best chance to bring a title back to Gainesville.
Florida’s depth has been a strength this season, but the 
Gators relied on their top two starters, Hedberg and senior Isabelle Lendl,  to keep them in contention for the title dur -
ing the second round.
Lendl’s score changed the least from the 
first round to the second. She dropped from a 74 (+3) on Monday to a 75 (+4) on Tues-day.  
Piccio’s drastic fall contributed to Florida’s 14-stroke def-
icit to current leader No. 3 USC. Piccio was tied with Hed-berg for second after the first round, but after shooting a 78 in the second round dropped into a tie at 23rd.
Anna Young, one of the final starters for Florida, shot a 
74 (+3) in Round 1 and a 77 (+6) in Round 2. Both scores are lower than her average of 78.1.
