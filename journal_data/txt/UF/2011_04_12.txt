HASN’T BEEN OPERATIONAL SINCE 2008.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND

While nuclear technology has re-
cently received intense public scru-
tiny following the events in Japan, 
nuclear engineering students at UF say there is no reason to panic over 
UF’s nuclear reactor.
The UF Training Reactor is a 
small-scale nuclear reactor housed 
in the Nuclear Sciences Building that is used to teach students how to operate and monitor power plant reactors. It hasn’t been operational since 2008.
To do experiments, control blades 
that absorb neutrons are removed from the core. Then, neutron-heavy plutonium beryllium adds the initial neutrons to get the reaction started.
The neutrons are then free to in-
teract with the uranium, which cre-
ates a chain fission reaction until the 
fuel is hot. At that point, the experi-ments begin.
“I don’t think a lot of people even know it’s here,” said Daniel Lago, a 
nuclear engineering senior at UF.
When some people hear “reac-
tor,” he said, they think of the Cher -
nobyl and Fukushima nuclear inci-
dents.
But this one is nothing like that, 
Lago said. 
The 52-year-old reactor, which is 
fueled by plates of uranium rather than the uranium rods big reactors use, doesn’t produce electricity be-cause it doesn’t boil water to turn turbines. 
The reactor only produces heat.
At its hottest, the 
fuel is 100 degrees Fahrenheit, not even strong enough to boil 
water. At most, it gives off about the same amount of radiation per hour as the amount that comes from eat-ing a banana and its naturally radio-active potassium.
“I was at St. Augustine the other 
day. I got more radiation from just standing in the sun than I would from standing next to the reactor,” said Andrew Cartas, a nuclear engi-neering senior at UF.

HARRISBURG, Pa. — Pennsylvania 
hunting regulators say it’s time to stick it 
to porcupines.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission is 
poised to declare open season on the slow-moving, razor-sharp rodents on Tuesday, citing complaints of property damage from residents.
Other states allow porcupine hunting. 
In Pennsylvania, porcupines are listed as a protected species but can be killed by resi-dents if they’re causing property damage.
Commission member Dave Putnam tells 
The Philadelphia Inquirer the proposal would offer residents the clear assurance they can kill troublesome porcupines. He says the animals damage log cabins and have been known to nibble on vehicle brake lines.
Some animal welfare groups question 
the plan.

Caged For A Cause
UF marketing student Ana Van Dingstee asks for donations for Alachua County Animal Services 
from inside a cage on University Avenue and 17th Street on Monday. It was the last day of a semester-long project for Stephen La Barbera’s cell management class. “Animal shelters are at capacity and don’t have the federal funds to support the animals,” Van Dingstee said.

Pre-med programs at UF and across the 
nation may need to revamp their programs 
if they want their students to master the new MCAT.
The Association of American Medical 
Colleges recently announced  preliminary recommendations for a revamped MCAT that would be unveiled in 2015. 
The MR5 Committee, a 22-member 
AAMC panel appointed in 2008 by the AAMC, reviewed the test for three years through outreach events, surveys and other avenues.
One of the biggest MCAT changes will be the addition of a “Behavioral and Social Sciences Principles” section, which will measure testers’ abilities to understand social and cultural issues, said Amjed Saf-farini, executive director of pre-health pro-
grams for Kaplan Test Prep. MCAT to get makeoverSTUDENT LIFE

Shea Michaels enjoys an infusion of 
Gator spirit when he lights up.
The 32-year-old disc jockey and fre-
quent hookah smoker favors a mellow 
hookah mix called Orange and Blue, which is a soothing combination of the blue mist and tangerine dream flavors.
But a flavor he can’t taste may pack the 
biggest punch.  
According to a recent UF study, cus-
tomers who came from hookah lounges 
had carbon monoxide levels that were 
more than three times higher than those who came from traditional bars. 
Carbon monoxide can’t be seen, smelled 
or tasted. It reduces the blood’s ability to carry oxygen and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or fainting in the short term and 
heart disease in the long term.
Tracey Barnett, an assistant professor 
in the UF College of Public Health and 
Health Professions, lead the study, which measured the carbon monoxide levels of 173 hookah cafe patrons and 198 patrons of traditional bars that allow smoking. 
While studies have been conducted on 
hookah use and carbon monoxide levels in 
the past, this was the first study to measure 
levels directly after exposure in a bar set-ting as opposed to in a lab.
“It’s different when there’s music, 
the lights are low and there’s potentially drinking,” Barnett said. “It’s a much better snapshot of what happens on a Friday or Saturday night.”

 UF is inviting all undergraduate students 
to complete the Student Experience in the 
Research University survey, known as SERU, and is offering incentives to do so. 
  The UF football ticket lottery opened for 
the 2011 season Sunday at 9 a.m., but in order for students to be eligible to enter, they must ﬁ  rst complete the survey.
  According to Marie Zeglen, assistant pro-
vost and director of institutional planning and research, incentives include football sea-son ticket lottery eligibility and discounted admission to the Butterﬂ  y Rainforest at the Florida Museum of Natural History and to the Harn Museum of Art. Students will also 
have a chance to win an iPad and gift cards to 
Amazon.com, iTunes and the UF Bookstore.
  The survey includes questions about cam-
pus life and questions geared toward the dif-
ferent colleges on campus. The questionnaire 
is offered every two years, and it takes about 
20 minutes to complete. The survey will be 
open until July 1.
  She said the main incentive should be to 
improve campus life and to address areas of concern, and not just to get football tickets.
  Jeanna Mastrodicasa, assistant vice presi-
dent of student affairs at UF, said the survey 
provides each student with 
the opportunity to address 
any concerns he or she has 
with the undergraduate experience. This includes sections about the college 
experience, student pro-
grams, faculty, social life, 
international globalization 
and academic honesty.
  Mastrodicasa said she’s expecting about 80 percent of undergraduate students com-plete the survey this year. 
  In March 2009, 68 percent of UF under-
graduates took the survey, Zeglen said.
  She said 11,607 students have already com-
pleted the survey, and she values answers from graduating seniors because they have been on campus for a long period of time.
  The different colleges on campus also 
compete to see which can have the most stu-
dent participation. The College of Education 
is currently in the lead with more than 60 percent of its students having completed the survey.  UF offers incentives for students to take survey

carbon monoxide tester as patrons 
exited local bars. The  non-hookah bar customers had an average car -
bon monoxide level of 8.9 parts per million. The average CO level of 
hookah patrons was 30.8 ppm.
Gainesville has several venues 
that offer hookah, including Sharab 
Lounge, Farah’s on the Avenue and Kava Bar and Hookah Hut. Both are establishments Michaels has smoked hookah at before.  
As opposed to when he’s smok-
ing at home, he said when he goes to 
a lounge he smokes more because of 
the social aspect of being out. 
“It’s doesn’t give me the same 
long-term effects as drinking,” he said. “If you party hard the night be-fore, you feel it in the morning. 
“[With hookah,] I don’t have that 
same crummy feeling the next day.”
Michaels said when he does 
drink, he also smokes more. 
Barnett said there haven’t been any studies looking at hookah and 
alcohol together, but she thinks that 
there is an effect there.
The study did find that even 
those who didn’t smoke while in the hookah lounge had an average carbon monoxide level of 11.5 ppm, an amount comparable to that of a cigarette smoker. 
Suzanne Sprinkles, a UF senior 
and server at Farah’s, said she hasn’t noticed a difference in how she feels from being around the hookah.
“It doesn’t make me feel weird 
or get tired or feel sick or anything,” she said. “I’ve been in a car with people smoking cigarettes and that does make me nauseous.”  
Jared Glosser, a  UF history fresh-
man, has been smoking hookah for four years and said he hasn’t noticed a difference in his health. 
“It’s a part of my culture,” he 
said. “That’s like if I were Southern and you were asking if I would stop eating chicken fried streak because of its health risks.”4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011

to the full-scale power plants, such as the 
Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station south of Miami.
“It’s a baby reactor in the sense that it 
is low power,” Lago said.
And since it doesn’t produce electrical 
power, it exists for the sake of students and researchers. With it, they radiate ma-terials like metals to see how they would hold up in space; test tissue samples for cancer research; and learn how to moni-tor a running power plant for problems.
Students sit in their nuclear engineer -
ing courses and use old data produced 
from previous experiments with the re-
actor while engineers and students work to add features such as a digital control room to the reactor, which originally cost about $450,000 to build.
Lago has worked on upgrading the 
reactor for three years, and he estimates it will be back in service before the end of the year.
When it’s done, it will be the first re-
actor in the U.S. to have a fully digital control room. The reactor will take mea-surements and make adjustments on its own, but people will watch the panels to make sure the machine does what it’s supposed to do.
Cartas said having a reactor on cam-
pus is an invaluable resource for stu-
dents.
“It really gives our students an edge,” 
he said.
He said it’s one thing to read about 
reactors in a book, but it’s so much better 
to see one in action.The reactor is being upgraded

MCAT , from page 1
StudentLifeThis section is partly a response to the 
need for doctors to have good bedside man-
ners with patients, which requires an ability to connect with people despite social and cul-tural differences, he said. 
“This is the biggest change the MCAT has 
seen in the last 20 years, but from a content perspective it’s probably the biggest change the MCAT has seen,” Saffarini said. 
Other changes to the MCAT may include 
less emphasis on physics and organic chem-istry and an increased focus on genetics and biochemistry , he said. The writing portion will be eliminated, and the test will take more 
than seven hours to complete instead of its 
current five-and-a-half hour timespan. 
The MR5 committee will continue to dis-
cuss potential changes before its final rec-ommendations are approved by the AAMC Board of Directors in February 2012, accord-ing to an AAMC press release.
The changes to the test may require un-
dergraduate pre-med programs to alter their course selections to better reflect the new test-ing material. Changes need to be made quick-ly, Saffarini said, because students who will 
take the MCAT in 2015 will enter college by 
fall 2012 or earlier.
Steven Siegal, a second-year medical stu-
dent at UF, said the recommendations to emphasize genetics and biochemistry on the MCAT are great, but he is wary of the plan to diminish the importance of organic chemistry and physics, which are important for a medi-
cal student’s foundation.
“To spend a whole year on 
organic chemistry and only have three or four questions on the 
MCAT is kind of ridiculous,” he said.
He also said the addition of the social sci-
ences section seemed unnecessary because knowing the answers to those questions isn’t going to help students relate to people better. 
“You can study all you want. Does that 
really teach the student how to deal with people?” he said. “I think you’re taking a very humanistic aspect and turning into a number.”TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

They’ve always told Les Payne  
“No.”
They told him “No” when he re-
quested a visa to cover the Soweto 
uprising in South Africa.
They told him “No” when he 
tried to find the body count for the 
protestors.
And they also said “No” when 
that work got him nominated for a 
Pulitzer Prize.
“Reporting is not something 
that begins until a person of power tells you ‘no,’” Payne told a crowd 
of about 150 during his presen-
tation at Pugh Hall auditorium 
Monday night.
He was a writer for Newsday 
on that June day in 1976 when national news rang out about a 
13-year-old boy who was shot for 
protesting apartheid in South Af-rica. 
But because of the controversial 
content, he said, he was forced to 
wait until September to cover the 
story.
There, he talked to guerrilla 
leaders. He spoke to Nelson Man-dela. He sat down with the family of a 5-year-old girl who was shot 
in the head in her front yard for 
flashing the black power sign.
He also spoke 
about how he used his skin col-
or to his advan-
tage in the field. 
He left his 
white counter -
parts from The 
New York Times 
and Time Magazine behind as he 
ventured into Soweto every day to 
speak with protestors and funeral home owners.
“If you were white, you stuck 
out like a wart on a bald head,” he 
said.
When the South African gov-
ernment released the death toll at 250, Payne investigated. He spent 
the next few weeks interviewing 
funeral home owners, crunching the numbers.
He found out the government 
was wrong; 853 had died.
Payne has witnessed several 
of those deaths through a camera lens.
His story, “White Power, Black Rage,” sparked protests across America, even at UF.
Having won a Pulitzer Prize for 
“The Heroin Trail,” a chronicle of Marcel Francisci, Payne went on to 
lead a newsroom of five Pulitzer 
prize winners at Newsday.
With several journalism stu-
dents in the crowd, he offered some advice.
“What was important was not 
winning another Pulitzer Prize,” 
he said. “What was important 
was that those families in Soweto knew what was happening to their 
people.” Pulitzer winner discusses covering apartheid protests THE UF ROCKET TEAM WILL 
COMPETE IN ALABAMA THIS WEEK.

Alligator Contributing Writer
It’s 9 feet, 6 inches tall and weighs 28 
pounds. It’s flown 3,790 feet high, but its 
teammates hope it will reach a mile high by 
competition time. 
Its name is Urban Fleyer, and it’s a rocket 
built by the UF Rocket Team. 
The team is going to Huntsville, Ala., 
from Wednesday through Sunday for the 
NASA University Student Launch Initiative,  
a competition for university-level students. 
The task is to build and launch a reusable rocket 5,280 feet high. 
The UF team will be competing against 
teams from 29 other universities, according 
to Samuel Darr, project leader for the USLI 
competition.
First prize is $5,000. The top five con-
testants are entered into level two of the competition the following year. Teams par -
ticipating in level two will have to launch a rocket 10,000 feet high and make the rocket 
waterproof.
This is the team’s second year going to 
this competition, Darr said. He’s confident 
the team will do much better than last year, 
when there wasn’t much student participa-tion or support. 
“We prepared 10 times harder than last 
year,” Darr said. “We’re much more positive going into this.”
Fifteen team members will be going to 
Huntsville to launch the rocket. 
According to Paul Chestnut, the team en-
gineer, they’ve been preparing for the com-petition for eight months. Once the planning 
phase was completed, the 
members spent more than 
100 hours assembling the 
rocket from scratch. The ma-
terials and fuel cost about $5,000.
“There are some teams that we’re ner -
vous about,” Darr said. “We are shooting for number five for sure.”
The American Institute of Aeronautics 
and Astronautics provided some of the funding for the team. It also received fund-ing from UF Student Government and grants from industries, which included aerospace engineering companies such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
Chestnut said NASA also gave the team 
funds because of the specific payload the 
team made. The payload is the piece ejected 
out of the rocket at its highest altitude. It named the payload Hail Mary, in honor of 
the football pass.
Although Urban Fleyer is the only rocket 
the team is launching at this competition, 
the team has made four rockets over the last 
eight months. Darr said that Urban Fleyer is 
the biggest of the rockets.
Darr said he is excited to see what the 
other teams have been working on all year and to present the final project.UF students hope rocket can join mile-high club

Today’s question: Did you know 
we have a nuclear reactor on campus?Monday’s question: Have you ever gone fishing?
83% YES17% NO
103  TOTAL VOTESIn the same way our everyday conversations and argu-
ments have fundamentally changed with the rise of social media, it is transforming the government’s rela-
tionship to the press. 
And it seems Florida is the guinea pig for the coming 
revolution.
For years, politicians’ communication specialists have 
called newspaper offices over points of contention in an article. 
They’ve aired their grievances over phone or email for 
so long that it has become tradition. 
The times are changing, and the fight is moving to Twit-
ter — at least judging by the actions of Communications Director Brian Burgess, part of Gov. Rick Scott’s posse.
Via Twitter, we’re able to witness what used to go on 
out of public view and watch how the news media actually 
relate to our dear governor when the cameras are turned 
off. 
Perhaps Floridians needed to see the volleys of pointed 
questions met with snarky answers to truly understand this strangely symbiotic relationship.
As each side questions and clarifies in 140 characters 
or fewer, we are left wondering if the public forum allows them to make government more transparent or if both sides are choosing their words more carefully knowing 
anyone could be watching. 
Judging from the political tweets we’ve seen and our 
own social media usage, both statements are probably 
true.
While this future holds some merit by letting anyone 
with an Internet connection in on the current political dis-cussion, it also lends itself to sensationalizing the topics at hand. 
It’s understood that people in the government and the 
media don’t see eye to eye all the time — we speak from experience —  and watching this battle of wills could drive people to take sides. 
When Burgess argues over a number given in a speech 
with a member of the press, we have to wonder if the ma-
jority of people reading his tweet really want a clarifica-
tion or if they want a digital shouting match between the two sides. 
Either result shows us more of the inner machinations 
of our leaders, but only one benefits society beyond a tem-porary sense of amusement.
It’s our understanding that mere quibbling gets us no-
where, so how could it be seen as a breakthrough when the powerful forces of our society are doing just that in 
front of us?
We’d argue it’s for the better that we see it and stay 
informed. 
We know that these types of showdowns have to hap-
pen anyway, but the way our government operates its 
public relations shouldn’t be kept out of sight and out of mind. 
Although people may not want to see a respected 
member of a political team squabbling with a well-known 
member of the press, it may be the way of the future. 
Scott’s team may be the first to utilize such belligerent 
tactics, but we don’t foresee it being the last.Twittering Twits

Distance shouldn’t limit relationships
As the horrific years of high school finally come 
to a long-anticipated close, many lovebirds find themselves debating the future of their coveted 
young romances. Sweethearts around the country gaze longingly into each others’ eyes and mourn the impend-ing split caused by age, different schools or any variety of other reasons. Many couples, fearing their young love is not strong enough glue to hold them together over dis-tance, find themselves pining out car windows in a cin-ematic way as they drive off to college toward untold ad-ventures. However, for folks such as myself, the distance 
is not enough of a deterrent to constitute a break up, and 
freshmen find themselves thrust into a whirlwind of con-
stant texting, hour-long Skype sessions and (hopefully) frequent weekend visits. 
Constant wonder, worry and, unfortunately, jealousy 
pepper my mind as well as my boyfriend’s, and I’ll admit 
my sorority membership doesn’t help his nerves when I 
hit the bars on a Friday night. That’s right folks; I’m in a long-distance relationship, and I’m here to relay my tes-timony to those tortured by their own pending relation-ships. Choosing to go long distance with a relationship is hardly ever applauded; in fact, I usually brace for the “eek” face I receive upon relating I am in one. Braving the pity smile and skeptical looks becomes second nature to those of us involved in an LDR, and we learn to smile as if it doesn’t bother us, but secretly we wonder if they’re right. 
All the insecurities come out: Maybe we are suffocating 
ourselves. Maybe we are afraid of trying something new. Maybe we are missing out on the college experience. 
Several seconds of doubt pass before we assure our -
selves that this relationship is worth it and then snicker at the ignorance of the doubters. The truth of a long-distance relationship is no secret; it defi-nitely sucks. Losing the luxuries of going on dates and seeing each other daily definitely takes its toll, and many couples find this is the main culprit of their romance faltering. On the bright side, the absence of these practices so often taken for granted forces couples 
to expand their conversations and activities to take advan-tage of what they retain. When my boyfriend and I get to-
gether, we are so excited to see each other we hardly ever 
stop to sit down, and our time together is full of laughter 
and excitement. To apply a cliche, absence certainly makes the heart grow fonder, and each visit reinforces my deci-sion to brave the LDR as I return to Gainesville, invigo-
rated from a magnificent weekend. Nothing meaningful 
comes easily, and the work my boyfriend and I put into 
our relationship is rewarded ten-fold in the special and passionate bond we share. 
If a couple can have implicit trust across thousands 
of miles, they’ve achieved a level many others never reach. Bottom line: Long distance relationships suck, and I would definitely not encourage couples who are iffy to pursue one. However, for those of us who are prepared to text constantly throughout the day and spend quite a few hours on Skype, the LDR can be successfully execut-ed. Solid relationships are hard to come by, so don’t let yourself throw one away because of a factor like distance. Where there’s a will there’s a way, and I can honestly say it is worth the effort to maintain a relationship you feel is valid. Go for it, lovebirds; it’s definitely worth a shot.

Columnist hits nail on the head
While captive in the passenger seat 
on a jaunt to Chiefland, I came upon 
Bob Minchin’s Friday column “Obama 
and his never-ending campaign.” It 
was a wonderful read, and I was kind of amazed to see such a quality work in this little college paper. I can see that 
there are still a few unmuddled intel-
lects left.
Minchin knows the truth, and I 
know the truth, but the public at large just may not “get it.”  I hope that his 
ideas reflect the population at large, 
but I fear they do not; more’s the pity.    There are many who vote only because of the entitlements. Their numbers are 
very high.  
In the beginning, only property 
owners could vote. Now, Donald Duck 
and Minnie Mouse can vote. There is not much of a future as things exist 
now.
As an older citizen, I have lived 
through World War II up to the pres-
ent. I pray America will not be crushed 
under the boot of a new totalitarian 
government. There are smart people out there who see such a government already galvanizing in the shadows with scary, un-American czars and 
dictator-types placed in every area of 
American activity.  
Should we worry?  I think so.It’s good to know we have people 
who understand this and a lot more.  I’m glad to know there are articles like this one reaching the youth who will one day vote. 
My day is gone, and I am left mostly 
to pray that the things predicted will be stopped in time. 
When I was young, I was not too 
smart. I hope today’s young people are 
a lot smarter.God bless you, and may your num-
bers increase.
Thanks, Mr. Minchin, for the lift you 
gave to me and to others who are of like mind and who love this country 
deeply.

UF employees should take pay cuts
In Friday’s edition of the Alligator, it 
was reported that next year’s cost of UF campus scooter decals will increase 50 
percent and car decals by $10, amount-
ing to a $72-a-semester and $144 flat-fee for a year, no matter what kind of vehicle you drive. 
Scott Fox, director of UF Transporta-
tion and Parking Services, said student decals will be more expensive because his department, which does not receive university or state funding, needs to 
make more money so it can pay its 
bills. 
In case you are interested, Scott Fox 
received more than $85,400 in salary 
from the university in 2010. 
That’s an increase of more than 
$13,000 from the salary he made in 
2009.
I think it’s about time university 
employees start taking pay cuts instead of raises when they need more money. They should stop passing their finan-cial woes onto students. 
It’s worth your time to check 
out other UF employee salaries for years 2010 and 2009 at: ir.ufl.edu/factbook/v-14_salaries.pdf and at col-legiatetimes.com/databases/salaries/

Kyle Ziegler 
UF studentLetters to the Editor
There are many reasons students 
decide to attend one university over another. 
For some students, especially those 
that aren’t poor enough to qualify for fi-nancial aid but not rich enough that go-ing out of state is an easy option, avail-
ability of merit scholarships is critical in 
that decision process.  
Over the past decade, there has been 
a general decline in awards for every major merit-based scholarship program 
I know about, both on the state level 
with Bright Futures and on the UF in-stitutional level with programs such as the National Merit and University Schol-
ars programs. 
In many cases, the cuts have been 
more than 50 percent over a period of 
several years. 
Many factors caused UF to become 
a university of prominent national stat-
ure, but one of the most important was 
that National Merit Scholars were es-sentially bought. 
One could argue that the awards 
were excessive, but it is indisputable 
that the increased number of National 
Merit Scholars made UF a more com-pelling place to attend. SAT scores rose, GPAs rose and general percep-
tion of the quality of the Student Body 
increased. It seems that the university benefited from a positive feedback ef-
fect, with more students viewing UF as 
an acceptable substitute to Vanderbilt, Miami and Emory, especially at the rock-bottom price. 
National Merit was reduced from 
thousands to $1,000 a year. 
University Scholars seems to have 
been reduced just from last year to $1,750  from $2,000. 
Reitz Scholars and Lombardi Schol-ars awards have also been substan-tially diminished over the last sev-
eral years. 
In addition, many of these merit-
based scholarships require the student to sign up for one-credit courses that eat into the scholarship amount. For ex-
ample, the College of Business requires 
three one-credit courses be taken over three semesters to participate in Univer -
sity Scholars Program. In effect, that is 
about a $500 reduction in the scholar -
ship that makes it marginally less ap-
pealing. 
In the interest of full disclosure, I 
am fortunate to receive merit scholar -
ship money at UF, and a diminishing amount of scholarship money is still money that many students do not have, but the decline of these scholarships 
poses a legitimate policy question. 
If UF wants to remain the top desti-
nation for education among many of the 
state’s top students, it must be more at-tractive than other national universities 
to stay on top. 
With tuition set to rise to the nation-
al average over the next several years 
along with increased competition for 
top students from places like the Uni-
versity of Alabama and the University of Central Florida, it would be a pru-dent action to stop the slide in funding for merit-based scholarships at the UF. 
The administration should reclaim 
competition for top students as a top priority. 
The return on the investment — es-
pecially in future alumni donations — could be well worth the investment.

Speaking OutBy MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
From the playground to the stage, Chris Cope knew he 
could always rely on his weight to win laughs. Weighing 
more than 300 pounds, fat jokes at his own expense were an 
easy way to win over a crowd.
Performing with a troupe of amateur comedians and tour -
ing Gainesville’s college bars five nights a week, Cope started his act by proclaiming he was losing weight.
“You think I’m fat now, you should have seen me six 
months ago — I’m on a diet!”
It wasn’t just a joke, though. Cope, 26, was working on los-
ing weight — he just wasn’t working fast enough.
Cope decided he wanted to work in comedy when he was 
still in high school. Other jobs just didn’t fit.
“I thought about being a lawyer because I’ve always been 
good at bullshit, but that’s too much education,” Cope said.
After graduating high school, Cope enrolled at Santa Fe 
College to pacify his parents. He chased his dream after class, 
in the town’s bars.
Cope first performed in the hotel bar at an old Clarion Inn. 
There was a single mic, a makeshift stage and crude lighting.
It was hard at first, but going on stage changed him. It was 
like the first hit of an addicting humiliation.
Cope improved his act and worked his way into a lead-
ership role with Gainesville Comedy Showcase, a group of local amateurs. Performing five nights a week while going to school and working at a barbecue joint wasn’t easy. Of the 
hundreds of amateur comics Cope saw perform with the 
group, few were able to make a living off their act.
Cope was one of the few: Two years ago, he was able to 
quit his “real” job and start traveling the country with his act. His largest gig paid $800, and he doesn’t expect to ever make 
more than $30,000 a year touring clubs.
“The money isn’t important, but it means you can drink 
more and hang out with more loose women,” Cope joked. 
“I’ve never had money, so not having it isn’t new.”
Along with his weight, Cope jokes about being poor. He 
jokes that when his family’s first mobile home burned down, his mom wanted to leave him in bed. “She whispered to my sister, ‘Shh, you’re going to wake up your brother,’” Cope said.
But when he talks about it personally, even though he 
keeps a smile on his face, there’s pain in his voice. The mem-ory of his family’s two mobile homes burning down is more than a joke. 
The fires taught him what it was like to own nothing. “It sucks to wake up twice with nothing.”But he doesn’t feel sorry for himself. He doesn’t resent 
anyone. He doesn’t expect any pity for being poor.
“It makes me appreciate not what I own, but what I have 
around me,” he said. “I’m rich, I’m just not materially rich.
He doesn’t expect to make much money, but he’s willing 
to work hard for it. In January, Cope drove almost 1,000 miles to perform in Harrisburg, Penn. 
He never expected that the fat jokes would come at such a 
high price so early in his life. 
Before the second night’s show in Harrisburg, Cope was 
relaxing in his motel room when his chest started to hurt.
The blood pumped out of his heart as his ruptured aorta 
pulled back toward his chest and stomach, spreading the pain to his back and gut. His body slowly began filling up with blood, in places it shouldn’t have, and his legs went numb.
He grabbed his cellphone and dialed his mother. She told 
him to hang up immediately and call 911.Cope was worried that he was going to die. He was lucky 
to be conscious — 80 percent of those who suffer an aortic aneurysm simply pass out and die. He made it to the hospital, 
and the surgeon told him they’d have to operate. 
Cope was lucky to be among the 20 percent who make it 
to the hospital. The doctors said he’d have a 50/50 chance of 
making it through the surgery.
“Chest pains. No joke. Don’t worry. My mom knows.”
That was the text message Cope sent to J.C. Currais.
The friends met five years ago when Cope started to men-
tor Currais in group workshops.
“Without Chris Cope, I wouldn’t be doing comedy profes-
sional right now,” Currais said. “I started off doing a lot of really f---ing weird material. And Chris does a lot of down-to-earth stuff. Chris was somebody who said, ‘You can just 
be you.’”
Currais said Cope is the sharpest comedian he’s ever 
seen.
“His ability to interact with any audience is unmatched, 
and it’s from years of performing and being willing to, at any moment, say, ‘Well, I don’t have to perform anymore’ and 
just talk —  and it works because he’s so sharp. He’s like a bear trap.”
And in all of their years performing together, Currais said 
he’s never seen Cope lose it on stage.
“If Chris goes into the audience and someone from the au-
dience comes back at him — they’re walking out of the room 
because they’re so embarrassed because of what Chris is say-
ing or they’re standing up and applauding,” Currais said. “He’s either winning them over or walking them out.”
As their professional careers developed, so did their off-
stage friendship. 
When Currais received the text message from the hospital, 
he thought he was about to lose his best friend. He gathered with the comedy group at Mother’s Pub, where they per -
formed every week. They came to sit and pray for Cope.
Two hours after he first started feeling pain in his chest, 
Cope was prepped for surgery. 
Before going into the operating room, he prayed with his 
mother and brother over the phone. He wanted to cleanse his soul.
The surgeons opened his chest with an electric saw and 
installed a medical-graph where the aorta and heart connect. Six hours later they wired his chest closed. 
After the surgery, Currais received a phone call. Cope was 
OK and things were looking good. 
Nothing is off-limits when he starts the crowd work. His 
goal is to get laughs, and while he’s mean, he wants the per -
son he’s joking with to laugh, too.
He never lets his physical appearance prevent him from 
talking to a woman. Whether it’s buying them a shot before the show or hitting on them from the stage, all of his friends testify Cope likes women — and the women like him back.
“Women always say they want a guy with a sense of hu-
mor, and I’m a professional sense of humor,” Cope said.
Sitting in the same bar his friends gathered at during the 
surgery, Cope says he’s either strong as hell, lucky or God likes him — one of the three, otherwise he’d be dead.
The doctors told Cope if he didn’t lose weight, his heart 
would fail. He always knew being fat could affect his health,  but surgery and having to pray for his life was enough moti-vation to finally start a diet and exercise routine.
“I’ve lost 50 pounds in five weeks. I’m losing weight like 
Tom Hanks in ‘Philadelphia,’” Cope jokes on stage. “I appre-
ciate you guys clapping, but you’re like, ‘He’s still kind of fat, 
though.’”
Giving them enough time to laugh some more, with per -
fect timing, he follows with another joke, “It’s 50 pounds! I basically lost Justin Bieber!”
But he’s proud of the weight he’s lost. And while he’s had 
to give up drinking and smoking, and he’s in debt with medi-
cal bills, he appreciates life more than ever.
“I’m glad I can still have sex. I can give up weed and I can 
give up booze, but if I had to give up pussy I’d shoot myself,” 
he joked. “I would have told the doctor, ‘F--- it, just stop.’”
If he stays on track with the diet, Cope will have to cut the 
fat jokes and change his act. But neither Cope nor his friends are worried about the changes.
“The only thing that’s changed about Chris Cope is that 
there’s a scar on his chest now,” Currais said. “What makes Chris funny isn’t weed jokes or fat jokes or pot jokes; he’s just 
funny. And when you’re funny — you’ll always be funny.”
Tonight, Cope, Currais and fellow Gainesville comedian Evan 
Ferl will be performing the first show of their new tour, “The 
Good, The Bad and The Sloppy,” at 8 p.m. at the Orange and 
Brew in the Reitz Union. Admission is free. 8, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011

REPORT: LANIER HEADING TO TEXAS alligatorSports Video Show alligatorSports Podcastn QUINTON DUNBAR HAS 
EMERGED AS A STARTER.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
Charlie Weis did not waste time 
pointing out his favorite receiver to 
Florida fans. 
On the first play of the Orange and 
Blue Debut on Saturday, Weis called for 
Quinton Dunbar to run a go route. The 
result of the play — an incompletion — did not matter nearly as much as the call itself, or the fact that Dunbar was even 
on the field.
Dunbar, a sophomore from Miami 
Booker T. Washington High, sat out 
last season with a hamstring injury. Throughout spring practices, however, 
coach Will Muschamp and several re-
ceivers praised Dunbar for his ability to stretch the field.
By Saturday, the last day of spring 
football, Dunbar was starting alongside Frankie Hammond Jr.
“Weis is always messing with me be-
cause when I first started I was probably 
seventh on the depth chart,” Dunbar 
said. “Each and every day, I came out 
and made plays, and I gradually made 
my way to the top.”
For all the changes the Gators have 
undergone this spring, no group has been more affected than the wide re-
ceivers. 
All 11 of UF’s scholarship pass-catch-
ers were recruited for the spread offense, a system frequently featuring four- and 
five-receiver sets. Now, under Weis’ pro-style scheme, two or three players 
will split out wide in each formation.  
As a result, only about one-fourth of 
those scholarship receivers will see sig-
nificant playing time. In the old offense, 
about half would have. Fewer available 
spots on the field, coupled with a new coaching staff free of preconceived bi-
ases, has revved up competition.
“Throughout the entire spring, the

Florida sophomore Quinton Dunbar has emerged this spring as a favorite to 
start at wide receiver after sitting out last season with a hamstring injury.
New system reshuffles wideout order 
Offensive line’s development more important than QB controversy
In the wake of another disappointing, but all too familiar, 
John Brantley performance on Saturday — 4-of-14 passing, 45 yards, no touchdowns; the only thing missing was an 
interception — people are already looking to stir up a quarter -
back controversy in Gainesville.
I’m not here to tell you that’s the right or wrong move. In 
fact, just the opposite: I’m here to tell you it doesn’t really mat-ter.
Look, the Gators don’t need a game-changer at quarterback 
in 2011. They need a game manager, a warm body who won’t throw interceptions, a competent play-er to hand off the ball who is also able to toss a few passes to Quinton Dun-bar, Frankie Hammond Jr. and Jordan Reed — someone who won’t ultimately 
prove to be a game-loser.
That could be Brantley . It might be 
Tyler Murphy. It could be Jeff Driskel. 
At this point, it very well might even be Jacoby Brissett, who is currently some-where between homecoming and prom at Palm Beach Gar -
dens Dwyer High.
“We need to understand that no position is going to be 
given to anybody on this football team,” UF coach Will Mus-champ said. “We’ll have great competition in the fall for that 
position. Right now, John Brantley is the starter.”
The point is, we won’t know until the fall. And as much  as 
Muschamp stands behind Brantley with the if-the-season-be-
gan-today talk, we have every reason to believe he is telling the By GREG LUCA

Florida sophomore Erik Murphy and 
freshman Cody Larson have been officially 
suspended from the team, coach Billy Dono-
van announced Monday. 
The two were arrested in St. Augustine 
early Sunday morning and charged with 
third-degree felony burglary after break-
ing into a car, according to St. Augustine 
police. 
“I’m aware of Cody and Erik’s situa-
tion and very disappointed with the news,” Donovan said in a statement. “The two are 
currently suspended from basketball-related activi-ties. I’m not going to com-ment further until I have 
more information and get 
a chance to meet with both 
student-athletes.”
According to the police 
report, Larson, Murphy 
and Joshua Adel, the team’s head manager, were in St. Augustine to visit Adel’s family. 
The three entered Scarlett O’Hara’s Bar 
and Restaurant as it neared closing time late 
Saturday night, saying they had lost a wal-
let. 
Witnesses who worked at the restau-
rant said Murphy and Larson were acting strange, watching and encroaching on a fe-
male employee who was counting money. 
That prompted a bouncer to ask them to leave. 
About five minutes after they departed, Larson, Murphy 
suspended following arrest

Florida swimmers Conor Dwyer and Gem-
ma Spofforth made history Friday night as 
they each received the Ben Hill Griffin Award for 2011. It was the first time since the incep-tion of the award in 1992 that two athletes 
from the same sport were named the male 
and female recipients.
Dwyer is the first swimmer to win the 
men’s award since Ryan Lochte took the honor in 2004, and Spofforth became one of three women to win the award in back-to-back years.
Spofforth said the honor is more meaning-
ful this year because of the repeat win and 
the attention it brings to swimming. Both ex-
pressed their hope that it will cause people to realize the merits of the sport and the amount of effort their teammates put in.
“It’s really great this year to have Conor 
alongside me, and it’s really great for swim-ming in general,” Spofforth said.
“It’s good to get it out there how hard we 
work and that our sport really does mean 
something,” Dwyer said. “We’re all striv-
ing to perform on the college level, but at the same time, we’re trying to do everything we can to compete in the Olympics.”
Dwyer will swim for the chance to compete 
in London in 2012 under UF and Team USA coach Gregg Troy this summer at the Olympic trials in Omaha, Neb. Spofforth, meanwhile, is sponsored by her native Great Britain to train in Gainesville for the Olympic trials.“It’s really great to be back in the same en-
vironment that made me the swimmer that I am and to be back with people who have the same goals and the same attitude that I have,” 
Spofforth said.
Her time at Florida was full of success, but 
she said the most memorable victory was the 
team’s first-place finish at the 2010 NCAA Championships.
But Spofforth said her work out of the pool 
was just as important. She spent most of her volunteer time at the Alachua County Crisis Center, also working with Climb for Cancer 
Sports Camp and Gator Tracks, delivering 
sneakers to the underprivileged.
Dwyer also worked with Gator Tracks dur -
ing his time at Florida and received countless swimming accolades, including 2010 NCAA Male Swimmer of the Year and the past two Southeastern Conference Male Swimmer of the Year awards. But of all his titles and hon-ors, Dwyer said the Ben Hill Griffin Award is 
his most memorable one.
“It’s an honor because there are so many 
great athletes here at UF, so to be named the 
top one is kind of a shock,” he said. “I’m just happy to represent the swim team the best I can.”n FSU HAS FLUMMOXED UF 
WITH OFF-SPEED PITCHES.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
Florida State’s formula for 
handling Florida has been pretty 
straightforward: throw plenty of off-speed pitches and keep UF’s hit-ters on their toes with an array of 
hurlers.
It’s worked so far this year for the 
No. 11 Seminoles, who have taken 
two of three meetings from the No. 4 Gators.
“It speaks to Florida State’s abili-
ty to mix and match a little bit,” said Aaron Fitt, the lead college writer for Baseball America. “They can 
play matchups: bring in a righty to 
face right-handers and a lefty to face left-handers. To me, that’s what it’s about really, the matchups.”
But Fitt said Florida’s offen-
sive struggles against Florida State shouldn’t be cause for concern when the two teams close out their regu-lar-season series tonight at 6 in Tal-
lahassee’s Dick Howser Stadium.
“Eventually, Florida is probably 
going to figure those guys out,” Fitt 
said. “I suspect Florida will swing the bats better [today].”
In the teams’ previous three 
meetings, 12 FSU pitchers combined for 19 appearances, including nine in the second showdown between the in-state rivals.
Due to the Seminoles’ strategy , 
the Gators (26-7, 9-3 Southeastern 
Conference) have not been able to 
get into an offensive groove and have hit only .210 against FSU (23-9, 9-6 Atlantic Coast Conference). UF has mustered just 10 runs off Semi-noles pitching, including five com-bined in two losses.
“Credit Florida State; they’ve got 
a lot of different looks in their bull-
pen,” Fitt said. “They’ve got a lot of 
guys they can bring in there from both sides — different arm slots, different angles, different kinds of stuff.”
For the most part, that “stuff” 
has been a healthy dosage of off-speed pitches and breaking balls, which UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said he addressed with his team 
prior to the Gators’ 5-2 loss against the Seminoles in Jacksonville two weeks ago.
“When they fall in trouble, they 
go to the breaking ball,” catcher Mike Zunino said after that game. “We know that. …We got to fix some stuff and try to get them next 
time.”
UF STRUGGLING IN MIDWEEK GAMES:  
While the Gators boast one of the 
top records in the nation, they are just above .500 in midweek games this year with a 5-4 mark.
Of the four losses, two have been 
at the hands of FSU, with the other 
two coming against inferior oppo-
nents Georgia Southern and UCF.
“You’d think that Florida would have the advantage in the midweek because they have the deepest pitch-ing staff in college baseball,” Fitt 
said.
Instead, it’s been the opposing 
teams who have often found the edge on the pitcher’s mound.
“It’s been a little surprising to me 
that they haven’t really hit midweek against pitching that I think is not as 
good as the pitching they’re rolling out there,” Fitt added.TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Larson’s prior sentence, probation could complicate freshman’s future
Larson and Murphy were spotted rummaging through a 
red 2004 Pontiac that belonged to a bar employee while Adel acted as a lookout. 
Upon being detected, Murphy, Larson and Adel fled the 
scene in different directions. Adel was apprehended first and proceeded to call Murphy, who walked back to the parking lot. 
The duo called Larson from the back of the patrol car 
and advised him to turn himself in, admitting in a recorded conversation they had agreed to break into the vehicle. 
Upon inspecting the car, the owner 
said the driver’s door was unlocked, with the glove compartment and center con-sole open, but he did not notice anything missing. 
While Murphy’s conviction is his first 
offense, the incident could be far more se-
rious for Larson. 
The freshman, who redshirted last sea-
son, received two years probation and a 120-day suspend-ed jail sentence in May 2010. 
The sentence was the result of a February incident in 
which he shared prescription Hydrocodone pills with a teammate and inhabited a room where drugs were used and stored. 
If Murphy or Larson were to miss playing time, it could 
have a severe impact on the Gators. 
The 6-foot-10, 229-pound Murphy and 6-foot-9, 
225-pound Larson are two of the three biggest players on the 2011-12 roster, a group that figures to lack frontcourt

depth (chart) has changed a lot,” said sophomore Stephen 
Alli, who finished with two catches for 31 yards in Satur -
day’s intrasquad scrimmage. “Everyone wants to get on the field. No one wants to come and sit on the bench on game 
days. It helps us get better, too, because everyone wants to 
make plays. Everyone has to make plays.”
The number of plays made Saturday was limited, as the 
Orange and Blue squads combined for 181 passing yards. Still, the emergence of Dunbar was one of the most surpris-
ing revelations from spring practice. 
Perhaps just as surprising? The man Dunbar replaced.Senior Deonte Thompson, who led the team with 38 
catches for 570 yards last season, ran with the second team, while Dunbar and Hammond started with quarterback John 
Brantley.
“I’m not surprised because I’m there every day,” Alli said. 
“[Dunbar] has made a lot of big plays, so he’s impressed a lot 
of people.” 
Thompson has long been criticized by fans for untimely 
drops. Most notably, the receiver bobbled a pass on a slant 
route against Mississippi State in October. The 
ball ultimately fell into Bulldogs defensive 
back Johnthan Banks’ hands and, 11 plays lat-
er, MSU scored a touchdown in an eventual 
10-7 upset.
At the same time, Thompson has flashed 
signs of brilliance. Two weeks after the Mis-
sissippi State loss, Thompson reached over the shoulders of Georgia’s Shawn Williams to snag a first down on 3rd and 
19, setting up a touchdown and robbing Georgia of a sure interception. The Gators went on to win in overtime.
But Muschamp criticized the receivers for inconsistency 
this spring, something that could hold back Thompson, whom former coach Urban Meyer always stood up for dur -
ing interviews.
Muschamp preached that no position was set in stone 
after the scrimmage, and the four receivers atop the depth 
chart did not separate themselves from the pack Saturday. 
Dunbar recorded two catches for 21 yards. 
Hammond, Thompson and Omarius Hines, meanwhile, 
each failed to catch a pass. 
Perhaps Weis needs to start messing with them, too.truth when he says the quarterback 
position will be up for grabs when the team reconvenes for fall camp.
It’s certainly the most interesting 
position battle on the team, and no-body can argue against that point. It’s where the glamour boys are made, legends are formed, bronze-
statues-to-be get their start — and 
where the blame most often falls.
However, it’s not UF’s area of 
greatest concern heading into the summer.
Anyone who watched Saturday’s 
Orange and Blue Debut can attest to that. Because the announced 53,000 people at The Swamp, plus every-one watching at home, saw that the 
Gators’ offensive line could be a di-
saster come fall 2011. 
Sure, the O-line was absolutely 
ravaged by injuries. Yes, Florida could only use seven game-ready linemen. And yeah, three of them played for both the Orange and Blue teams.
But UF had only 12 linemen on its spring roster in the first place. 
Some of them have rarely been 
able to stay on the field consistently due to injuries. Some are completely unproven. 
And the rest of the group, if 
we’re being completely honest, isn’t littered with first-round NFL Draft picks.
The current crop of linemen, who 
will be charged with opening up the running lanes for Rainey and Demps and keeping some poor quarterback upright, amassed a whopping 17 starts last season, 15 of which came 
from guard Jon Halapio and tackle 
Xavier Nixon.
Jonotthan Harrison, the player 
UF is entrusting with snapping the ball and making more protection calls, is a converted guard who said he hadn’t played center since his freshman year of high school. 
To be fair, everyone says Harri-
son has instantly taken to his new job in practice, but what does the fact that he had to be moved from guard say about the line’s depth?
But you can’t help but be a little 
wary after seeing Dominique Eas-ley , Sharrif Floyd, Ronald Powell and Co. manhandle anyone stand-ing between them and the helpless 
quarterbacks Saturday.
Part of the formula for creating 
a reliable line, perhaps the most im-
portant yet undefinable aspect, is simply finding the right mix. 
Florida could put together the 
right five guys, but they need to know how to work together to have any chance of performing well.
As Muschamp said Saturday, 
there are two position groups where chemistry is of the utmost impor -
tance: the secondary and the offen-sive line.
If your secondary can’t commu-
nicate, you’re going to get torched for touchdowns.
And if the Gators’ offensive line 
isn’t ready to go by Sept. 3, when Florida kicks off against Florida At-lantic, the only quarterback contro-versy will be whether or not he can stay on his feet.16, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, APRIL 12, 2011
