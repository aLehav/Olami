After two days, white smoke from 
the Sistine Chapel signaled the end of 
the search for a new pope.
On Wednesday , members of the 
College of Cardinals selected Cardi-nal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, 76, of Bue-nos Aires, Argentina, to be the 266th pontiff and lead the Roman Catholic Church under his new name, Pope Francis I.
Thousands of people packed into St. Peter’s Square to see Pope Francis address the world for the ﬁ  rst time.
Rebecca Drescher, a 20-year-old UF 
English junior who is studying abroad in Rome, said she had to act fast to make it through the sea of waving ﬂ  ags and umbrellas to capture pictures of the historical moment.
“It stopped raining when the pope 
came out,” she said. “He addressed the Roman people and everyone cheered ‘Francesco!’ over and over. Everyone was extremely emotional and excited. It was the coolest thing, being a part of history.”
Francis is the ﬁ  rst cardinal from the 
Americas to be elected pope and the ﬁ  rst non-European to lead the church in at least 1,200 years. He succeeds Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, who announced his resignation last month. 
In Gainesville, Manuel Vasquez, 
professor and chairman of the UF Col-lege of Religion, said the election acted as a shift in the Catholic world.
“It’s a recognition that most growth 
is in the south, particularly in Africa, South America and Asia,” he said.
Francis is also the ﬁ  rst pope from 
the Jesuit order.

For lunch Wednesday, Martin Gordillo chowed 
down on a Subway sub at the Rawlings bus stop for the 
second time since the Rawlings Plaza opened Sunday.
The 24-year-old UF sociology junior learned about 
the market when he got off the bus this week.
“I just thought the building was under construction 
until I saw the sign for Subway,” he said. “I was like, ‘What? Oh, hell yeah.’”
The Rawlings Plaza features a Provisions on De-
mand Market and a Subway. 
The market has sushi, milkshakes, fountain sodas 
and snacks.
“It serves an area of campus with high foot trafﬁ  c 
for students who utilize the bus service on campus,” Marketing Program Manager for Gator Dining Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email.
The hours of operation are:Monday through Thursday from 7 a.m. to midnight, 
Friday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Gator Dining has promoted the new location through 
several advertising methods, Rodriguez said, includ-ing a listserv to inform thousands of faculty members and students, digital advertising screens, social media, signs in front of the facility and interior RTS bus cards.
Evan Broggi, a 23-year-old UF biochemistry junior, 
said the market needs tables and chairs outside the Rawlings bus stop right before he bit into his ﬂ  atbread sub.

Race enthusiasts are burning 
rubber to get to Gainesville this 
weekend for the 44th Annual NHRA Gatornationals competi-tion.
The four-day event, which 
runs from today to Sunday, will be at the Autoplus Raceway at Gainesville, 11211 N. County Road 225.Nate Cross, sales and mar-
keting manager of Autoplus Raceway, said he expects about 100,000 spectators and 500 teams to ﬂ  ood the city for the competi-tion.
Cross said drivers compete for 
cash prizes, which range from $5,000 to $10,000 a race, and the honor of moving to bigger races.
Spectators can pay about $150 
in advance for a general admis-sion pass.
Single-day passes are avail-
able at various prices.
With thousands of people de-
scending onto the city this week-end, local hotels have ﬁ  lled up.
For Susan Perkins, general 
manager of the Hampton Inn on Southwest Archer Road, it’s busi-ness as usual.
Perkins estimated that about 
60 percent of her rooms were booked by Gatornationals specta-tors.
“It’s been like this every year,” 
she said.
However, in the race for hotel 
rooms this weekend, Vanessa Mi-chaud got left in the dust.The 20-year-old University of 
Miami international ﬁ  nance and marketing sophomore planned to visit her friend in Gainesville with her parents but faced set-backs when she tried to ﬁ  nd a place for her family to stay. 
Her parents ended up 30 miles 
away in Ocala. 
“There was no hotel avail-
able,” she said. “It was all full.”

Ed Braddy is a back-to-the-basics 
guy who thinks Gainesville needs new leadership.
Braddy, 41, is running for mayor 
in Tuesday’s Gainesville city elec-tions on a platform to advocate small-business growth and improve communication between the city and its residents. 
“I’m very disappointed in the 
leadership out of City Hall,” he said.
Braddy is the testing coordinator 
at Santa Fe College and the executive director for the American Dream Coalition, a nonprofit think tank that promotes market-oriented solutions to urban problems.
He has lived in Gainesville since 
1991. After he graduated from Santa Fe College, Braddy earned a bache-lor’s degree in history from UF and a master’s degree in American history at James Madison University. 
From 2002 to 2008, Braddy served 
as the District 2 City Commissioner. He said his experience on the com-mission helped him learn how to lead and address city issues.
“You’ve got to go to where the 
people are to understand their con-cerns,” he said.
If elected mayor, Braddy said 
he would work to improve public safety services and repair city infra-structure.
“You can’t sit there and let them 
fall into disrepair,” he said.
Braddy added that he would treat 
residents with respect during public meetings and show an interest in af-fordability for residents. To Braddy, the public comments section of City Commission meetings has become a “highly contested event.” He wants to fix that by giving people more time to share their ideas. 
“It’s not the mayor’s meeting,” 
he said. “It’s the people’s meeting. If people want to take four minutes or five minutes, let them talk for four minutes or five minutes.”
Debbie Martinez, a former down-
town business owner, said she has known Braddy since 1998. She agrees with Braddy’s goal to connect the government and residents. She supported his opposition to a city biomass contract. 
“Ed Braddy is the only mayoral 
candidate with the good judgment on these issues,” she said. “He’s con-fident, and he’s experienced.”

With less than a week until Tuesday’s Gainesville city elec-
tion, candidates discussed local business, the soft closing of 
bars, utility rates and homelessness Wednesday night. 
UF Student Government’s Chomp the Vote agency hosted 
the forum in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom. About 60 people attended.
Mayoral candidates Ed Braddy , Scherwin L. Henry , Pete 
Johnson, Donald Shepherd, Mark V enzke and incumbent Craig Lowe participated along with District 4 candidates Alfredo Es-pinosa, W.E. “Mac” McEachern and incumbent Randy Wells.
Espinosa said he wants to create a liaison between UF’s 
Career Resource Center and the Gainesville Chamber of Com-merce that would notify students of internship and job oppor -
tunities in the city.
V enzke, Johnson and Lowe support soft closing.  McEachern 
said that soft closings have been done before and didn’t work, but said he is “willing to listen to anything that you have to present.”
Wells said utility rates have declined for typical users, but 
rates in other parts of Florida have dropped more. Espinosa said the city should get out of its current biomass contract. Lowe dis-agreed, saying that biomass is cost-effective in the long run. 
Braddy said the biomass isn’t environmentally friendly.“That biomass plant is going to consume 1.4 million gallons 
of water per day,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 14, 2013

Despite Francis’ age, Vasquez 
said he expects the new pope to 
lean toward reform.
“[The Jesuits] have a long his-
tory of being innovators in the church,” Vasquez added. “And along with that comes controversy also.”
Gonzalo Girado, a 22-year-old 
UF mechanical engineering senior and president of the Argentine Student Association, said he was proud an Argentine was selected pope.
“It shows the church is more di-verse and how Latin American so-ciety as a whole is making a move-ment,” he said.
Luke De-
Hon, a 20-year-old UF econom-ics junior and Catholic Gators member, said 
he will support Pope Francis because of his views and his 
alignment with church doctrine.
“[Francis] teaches what Christ 
taught, and he reflects a lot of what youth want, including a strong foundation,” DeHon said.PoPE , from page 1

As a former City Commissioner, 
Scherwin L. Henry is going back 
into politics to finish what he start-ed.
“I’m going back to complete 
unfinished business,” he said. “To provide a new perspective of lead-ership for the city of Gainesville.”
Henry, 60, is running for mayor 
in Tuesday’s Gainesville city elec-tions on a platform of economic growth.
Henry said he’s focused on mak-
ing living more affordable by bring-ing more jobs and creating better access to transportation.
While Henry served as District 
1 City Commissioner from 2006 to 2012, he helped build several parks, planned a new library and helped increase housing.
By the end of his second term, 
Henry said, he felt there was a dis-connect between the city and its residents.
“Local government can’t be an 
island of itself to accomplish goals on behalf of the city,” he said. “We must be able to work together.”
As a 1983 UF graduate and 38-
year university employee, Henry said he wants better opportunities for UF students to find jobs after graduation.
“What we need to do is actually 
have Gainesville become a place where its residents feel like they have the opportunity to better their station in life,” he said.
To do that, he said, the city needs 
to cultivate jobs and employment opportunities.Armando Grundy, 32, has 
known Henry for seven years and has worked on his campaign as a volunteer since December.
Grundy said Henry has the abil-
ity to heal the fractured relationship between the city and its residents.
“I’ve watched him exercise sound 
judgment and give the leadership this city needs,” Grundy said.

� IT HAS TRIPLED IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.

Jessica Schulte has Bright Futures, grant money and two 
jobs, but she still has to take out about $6,000 in loans each 
semester.
Schulte, a 22-year-old UF environmental science senior, 
said she has about $25,000 in loan debt.
“I’m honestly scared to look at the real amount,” she 
said.
Student debt has tripled in the past eight years, accord-
ing to a new report from the New York Federal Reserve. The increase includes factors such as more people attending col-lege, students taking longer to graduate and students attend-ing graduate school.
However, Schulte said, she uses more loan money because 
financial aid has declined, and tuition has risen.
Within the past year the estimated cost to attend UF has 
increased $760 for undergraduates, according to Student Fi-nancial Affairs.
“I remember my freshman year I would get close to $1,200 
back in grant money after my tuition and fees were paid,” Schulte said. “Now, I get close to $700 back.”
Total student debt in the United States was almost $1 tril-
lion at the end of 2012, according to the reserve.
But for students like Schulte, there are advantages to hav-
ing $25,000 in student debt.
According to the reserve, college graduates have a lower 
unemployment rate, survive better during recessions and en-joy salaries almost double those of high school graduates.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” said UF economics profes-
sor Colin Knapp.
However, student debt isn’t as big a problem at UF as it is 
at other universities, he said.
About two-thirds of UF students graduate with no stu-
dent loan debt, according to the UF website.
Ashley Coffman, a 20-year-old UF event management 
sophomore, takes out loans because her mom can’t afford her tuition.
“It sucks, but at the same time, I know that having a col-
lege education is most important,” she said.Student loan debt

65% NOWednesday’s question: Have you bought 
Girl Scout cookies in the Gainesville area?Today’s question: Do you approve of the new pope? 
Real talk: Florida is one of the worst states. Take a drive 
through our great state, and describe how many smells you encounter. It’s not pleasant. Not to mention, our 
state’s government is often terrible and maybe even corrupt.
No, we’re not even talking about Gov. Voldemort. We’re 
talking about Florida’s Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll.
Carroll resigned this week “amid an investigation into an 
alleged illegal-gambling scheme that ofﬁ  cials said has led to charges against 57 people,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
“Individuals were arrested [Tuesday] for racketeering and 
money laundering charges in connection with Allied Veterans of the World’s illegal gambling companies,” Scott’s chief of staff, Adam Hollingsworth, wrote in an email to reporters, according to the LA Times.
“Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll consulted for Allied Veterans while 
serving as a member of the Florida House of Representatives in 2009 and 2010. She was interviewed by Florida Department of Law Enforcement ofﬁ  cers regarding her work with the com-pany,” he said. “Lt. Gov. Carroll resigned in an effort to keep her former afﬁ  liation with the company from distracting from the administration’s important work on behalf of Florida families. She made the right decision for the state and her family.”
“Allied Veterans was founded in 1979 and evolved from a 
charitable organization that ran bingo games and held bake sales for veterans to a group suspected of widespread illegal gambling around Florida, according to an Internal Revenue Ser-vice afﬁ  davit,” according to ABC News. “The IRS pronounced the charity a fraud.”
Not only are you running an illegal gambling scheme, but 
it’s also under the guise of a veterans’ charity? You’ve gotta be kidding. It was not enough that we’re are the laughingstock of the nation, now we’re also more despicable than we were just a week ago?
Regardless of her direct involvement with the gambling 
scheme, we’re happy Carroll stepped down this week. She was at the center of a rumor-ﬁ  lled scandal this summer — a “former aide to Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll claiming that she caught her boss in a ‘compromising position’ with another female staffer,” according to the New York Daily News.
That wasn’t the problem. The problem was how Carroll re-
sponded to the accusation.
“Black women that look like me don’t engage in relationships 
like that,” Carroll said, with a laugh. 
Instead of being an awesome role model, she basically only 
did things that didn’t make anyone proud.
What do resigning lieutenant governors say in their resigna-
tion letters? Carroll’s was two sentences. It was addressed to “The Honorable Rick Scott,” and it read:
“Effective immediately, I hereby resign the Ofﬁ  ce of Lieuten-
ant Governor of the State of Florida. It has been an honor to have served the State of Florida in this capacity.”Shame of

Florida’s politicians

On Tuesday night, I, along with hundreds of other students and Gainesville residents, had the distinct privilege to hear Elie Wiesel, writer, Nobel laureate 
and Holocaust survivor, speak at UF.
He ambled onto the stage and delivered a beautiful 
speech about the power of knowledge and the sin of wasting it. He talked about speaking to the Dalai Lama and meeting Oprah. During the Q-and-A session that followed his speech, he listened patiently as quivering, awestruck students asked questions about survival, the existence of God and his opin-ions about current global issues.
The questions, on the whole, were interesting and thought-
provoking, except one.
A man on the mezzanine level of the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts approached the microphone and asked for Wiesel to weigh in on the debate about the Second Amend-ment in the United States.
Wiesel said that if a person needs a license to drive a car, 
then he or she needs a license to buy a gun.
The same man asked a follow-up question, something 
to this effect: Did Wiesel believe the events of the Holocaust would have been different if Germany had had an equivalent to the Second Amendment?
A murmur went through the audience, and people craned 
in their seats to see who would ask Wiesel, a prominent ad-vocate against violence, a calculated question about gun con-trol?
Wiesel, of course, answered with aplomb. He said, in his 
extended answer, that he doesn’t believe in “ifs.”
The historical-speculation argument for gun control isn’t 
new, but as Alex Seitz-Wald, political reporter for Salon, wrote in his piece “The Hitler gun control lie,” “The ancillary claim that Jews could have stopped the Holocaust with more guns doesn’t make any sense at all if you think about it for more than a minute.”
“Does the fact that Nazis forced Jews into horrendous 
ghettos indict urban planning?” Seitz-Wald wrote. “Should we eliminate all police ofﬁ  cers because the Nazis used po-lice ofﬁ  cers to oppress and kill the Jews? What about public works — Hitler loved public works projects? Of course not. These are merely implements that can be used for good or evil, as much as gun advocates like to ar-gue about guns themselves. If guns don’t kill people, then neither does gun control cause genocide (geno-cidal regimes cause genocide).”
And while Wiesel was correct 
in his assertion that big “ifs” such as this are meaningless, I don’t 
believe the question he was presented came from a place of good intentions or a desire for the intelligent answer that Wi-esel provided.
I believe the man in the audience was looking for a spe-
ciﬁ  c answer: He had an agenda. 
One of the problems with the current gun-control debate 
is the pro-gun inclination for unfounded logic for more re-laxed gun laws.  
Arming teachers will not stop school shootings, pressur-
ing women to carry guns at all times will not lower rape sta-tistics and, unfortunately, guns would not have prevented a Holocaust during World War II.  
In his article, Seitz-Wald interviewed Brown University 
Historian Omer Bartov, who said, “Their assertion that they need these guns to protect themselves from the govern-ment — as supposedly the Jews would have done against the Hitler regime — means not only that they are innocent of any knowledge and understanding of the past, but also that they are consciously or not imbued with the type of fascist or Bolshevik thinking that they can turn against a democrati-cally elected government, indeed turn their guns on it, just because they don’t like its policies, its ideology or the color, race and origin of its leaders.”
The question of speculation at a serious discussion about 
philosophy and survival at a lecture given by a man who has devoted his life to what the Norwegian Nobel Commit-tee called “practical work in the cause of peace” is simply a waste of time.

You might mistakenly call it a 
blanket, a bedspread or a cover.  You 
might even correctly call it a quilt. For the Quilters of Alachua County Day Guild, a quilt is more than that: It’s a piece of art.
Quilting refers to the technique 
of joining three layers of fabric with stitches or ties to make a layered type of blanket that features differ -
ent designs.
“Quilting is an art just as painting 
is,” said Jean Rosell, first president of the Quilters of Alachua County Day Guild. “It’s just art using fibers and fabrics rather than paints and a brush.”
Rosell is a long-time quilter who 
began practicing her art more than 30 years ago in a small quilt shop in Plantation.  
Rosell, a retired schoolteacher, 
moved to Gainesville in 1996 and opened her business, RoseCreek Quilts, in 2001. 
Two years later, she became one 
of the founding members of the guild, a group of local Gainesville quilters who share a passion for tquilting through a variety of activi-ties.  
The group took off faster than 
Rosell expected.
“When six initial members sat 
down and started the day guild 10 years ago, we advertised our first meeting, but we weren’t sure how much interest we’d have,” Rosell said. “So, we decided to set out 25 chairs, but we ended up having 65 people come to that very first meet-ing. We had to find more chairs.”                                                                                                                            
Ten years later, the guild has 
grown to more than 120 members who participate in activities that range from quilting workshops and shows to community service and outreach.
Since the guild began in 2003, 
members have made a name for themselves in Alachua County, hav-ing donated more than 800 quilts along with tote bags, medical dolls, pillowcases and other handmade items to the Gainesville Fire Depart-ment and Alachua County Public Schools, among other organizations.
Beverly Hilton, owner of quilt-
ing and craft supply store Crafty Bev and former vice president of the guild, said it’s eye-opening to see the kind of impact their service has on the community.
“A child who gets a quilt when 
she’s just had to leave her home un-der some pretty traumatic conditions receives something she can hold onto. She knows someone made this for me, someone cared enough to make something that I can call my own,” she said. “We love sewing together, and we have fun doing it. But I’m telling you, it really puts our activities in a different perspective.”
Though members share a mis-sion to serve the community and a common passion for quilting, the guild is made up of several different types of quilters, many of who are classified as either traditional or art quilters.
Rosell is a traditionalist — a quil-
ter who uses blocks of fabric to make a quilt pattern, much like one would see on a bed quilt.  
Hilton considers herself an art 
quilter. After health problems in 1999 left her unable to read lines and patterns required for traditional quilting, she transitioned into art quilting.
“There are no rules in art quilting. 
I still appreciate traditional quilting, but personally, I love the freedom of being able to come up with a crazy idea and convert it into fiber,” Hil-ton said.
An art quilt’s purpose is to tell a 
story — to communicate a concept from the quilter to the viewer, much like other art forms.
“An art quilt can literally take 
one evening or a couple of years. It really depends on the complexity of it. Sometimes you get stuck ... just like writer’s block,” Hilton said.
So what constitutes an art quilt?“Honestly , art is in the eye of the 
beholder, so you’ll see lots of differ -
ent things,” Hilton said. “There’s fabric painting and manipulation or simple techniques like appliqué. … It’s simply a matter of learning the materials and tools that are available to you, coming up with an idea and then executing it.”
March is National Quilting 
Month, and for local Gainesville quilters, it’s an opportunity to share their works of art with the commu-nity at festivals and exhibits across Florida.
For local residents, one of those 
opportunities is at the Gainesville Tower Road Library through March, where members of the Quil-ters of Alachua County Day Guild have displayed their quilts on the library’s walls.
This annual event is a favor -
ite among library patrons and has grown popular with the community, said Librarian and Adult Program-ming Coordinator Carolyn Wallace.
“People are really in anticipa-
tion each year to see the new quilts and the new designs,” Wallace said. “Some of the quilts are really amaz-ing and innovative, and it’s so great to see the ones that are made for their community service projects.”
It’s a passion for their art and 
serving their community that keeps these quilters’ needles working.
“Oh my goodness — it becomes 
addictive,” Rosell said. “It’s kind of like an adventure. … I’m always fas-cinated to see what’s going to hap -
pen when I’m able to turn this fabric into something special that’s also useful to someone.”

� FLORIDIANS MISS THE 
MOST LOVE CONNECTIONS AT WALMART, STUDY SAYS.
ANGELA SKANE
Avenue Contributing Writer
In Aisle 1, you’ll find frozen 
pizza. In Aisle 7, Gatorade. And 
if you’re lucky, you’ll find love in Aisle 13.
Next time you consider mak-
ing a late-night Walmart run in your pajamas, think again, be-cause you could meet your next flame. A study published in Psy-chology Today showed that the majority of Craigslist missed con-nections come from America’s fa-vorite superstore.
Missed connections is a section 
on Craigslist in which people can describe a person they missed out on potentially connecting with. People typically write about their encounters and their surround-ings in hopes of meeting the one who got away.
Florida is one of the 15 states 
that racks up love connections in the classy establishment Wal-mart. I guess these people have never been on www.peopleof-walmart.com.
Despite topping the chart 
statewide and nationally, the popular one-stop-shop isn’t the location of many local ads. 
At press time, only one Wal-
mart post existed from the last month. (If you are a man with a “model-esque” face and curly, dark brown hair with a perfect high-fade who frequents Wally World, someone is looking for you.)
Sift through the posts on 
Gainesville’s Craigslist, and you will see that popular bars and restaurants, like the Atlantic and Starbucks, are full of love-struck customers with vivid memo-ries. It almost makes you want to pause and question the situa-tion’s validity.
But then again, there are also 
some vague, o p e n - e n d e d posts, which leave you won-dering if you are, in fact, the missed connec-
tion. (Blond guy wearing black shorts at the gym — that nar -
rows it down, right? — your love awaits.)
Is something as simple as 
posting a stranger’s description online socially acceptable now? 
Thanks to our BFF, the Inter -
net, we’re naturally awkward in face-to-face situations like these, which makes approaching an at-tractive stranger difficult. And when that happens, we turn back to the Internet to Facebook stalk (if we, by chance, got his or her name) or to post a missed connec-tions ad. Ah, the circle of life.
No matter where you find 
your next mate, this proves one important thing: Love at first sight exists. 
Now, go to your local Walmart 
,and find your soulmate — we’re looking forward to reading about it on Craigslist. Looking for love in the 
frozen-foods section

Dear Friend, 
The meaning of life is Phil Collins’ classic panty-
dropper song, “In the Air Tonight.”Dear Mediocre Advice, 
What is the meaning of life?Dear friend, 
Your friend should call her out on it. Tell her to find a new place to have sex. Shower sex is great, but not when you’re sharing it with others. Plus, no matter how many people deny it, at least one of her roommates — prob-ably all of them — pees in the shower. Where your friend’s roommate has sex is not anyone’s business, but when you bone in a place that four other people need to clean their bodies in, 
it’s everyone’s business. Dear Mediocre Advice, 
My friend’s roommate lets her boy-friend stay with her for weeks at a time, and they have sex in a shower that four other people share. Also, she moans like a goat. What should 
my friend do?
Dear Friend, 
Some guys are capable of fulfilling your sexual needs and some just have great personalities. You two should share what you both like, and hopefully, he will be willing to try a few things you have in mind. If he’s not into the same dirty things you are, you should move on to a suitor who is on par with your desires. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink — or in this case, bang the 
s--t out of you. Dear Mediocre Advice,  
How do I get the nice, innocent guy I’m sleeping with to talk dirty 
and be rough in the bedroom?Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m a female and have always wanted to experi-ment with girls. The opportunity never came up in college, and now that I’ve graduated, I feel like I missed my chance. How can I find a girl to casually 
hook up with now?
Dear Friend, 
Exploring your sexuality isn’t restricted to college. Whatever chance you think you missed, you have not. Just head to a gay bar, and see how it goes. I wish you the best of luck on your adventure. Write 
back, and let me know how it goes. I’m serious. I want to know.

As if the rock ‘n’ roll documentary 
wasn’t enough, Dave Grohl’s “Sound City” 
players banded together to make an accom-panying record the old-fashioned way.
Director and mega-rocker Grohl ap-
pears on every track, changing up his in-volvement in each song. He drums, he riffs, he sings — he is as much the heart and soul of this record as the Neve console that was so influential to the beginning of all of these artists’ careers.
A variety of rockers are featured on the 
record, beginning with Rage Against the Machine’s Tim Commerford on the open-ing track, “Time Slowing Down.” It’s slow to start, but the song eventually kicks in with a modern alternative feel. Segueing into Stevie Nicks’ contribution, “You Can’t Fix This,” the mood changes decades with a ‘70s spirit taking over.
Other notable tracks include “From Can 
To Can’t,” which features Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Stone Sour, and “Mantra,” which features Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age’s Joshua Homme and Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor. The latter is an interesting mesh of Grohl’s gravelly voice and Reznor’s intricately dark, technology-infused music. This is a clear standout on the record. It starts off soft, but by the end, it builds to a great crescendo.
If one track were to sum up the experi-
ence of both the film and accompanying soundtrack, it’s “Cut Me Some Slack,” 
which features Paul 
McCartney . 
As explained in the 
film, the Neve console was purchased partial-ly because of the desire to search for the next Beatles. Grohl and fel-low Nirvana member Krist Novoselic play 
with McCartney on the rollicking, heavy track,ceating another standout song.
The Hippodrome Cinema will host a 
free screening of “Sound City” tonight. Check out the (admittedly awesome) docu-mentary, and win some cool prizes cour -
tesy of Sony Music. 
The screening starts at 10:15 p.m., but re-

Being funny is just another 
day in the life of Trevor Moore.
Moore is the founder and 
leader of the comedy troupe 
Whitest Kids U’ Know and a regular correspondent on “The Tonight Show” with Jay Leno. He also co-directed, co-wrote and co-starred in the 2009 com-edy film “Miss March.”
The Whitest Kids U’ Know 
concluded its fifth and final sea-son on the Independent Film Channel in June 2011. 
The troupe is on the East 
Coast leg of its 2013 North American tour, and will per -
form a comedy show at High Dive at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Tick-ets are available at www.Tick-etWeb.com.
The Avenue sat down with 
Moore to talk about the tour, his upcoming comedy album “Drunk Texts to Myself,” (avail-able March 26) and how life has been for WKUK since the end-ing of the show.Q: What can fans expect 
from your Gainesville perfor -
mance? 
A: We used to do the show 
as a live show before it was a TV show. ...We do popular sketch-es that we’ve had, sketches that have done well on YouTube. We also do some deep cuts from the TV show, ones that we like that are more obscure. Then, we also 
do some s k e t c h e s that we can’t really do on a TV 
show that work more as live piec-es.
Q: Since WKUK wrapped, 
how has the dynamic between  the guys been?
A: Our dynamic hasn’t real-
ly changed a whole bunch. The biggest difference is that we all don’t live in the same city . ...We all come together to do these tours. We’ve been in this troupe for 13 years now, so it’s kind of like riding a bicycle.
Q: Where does the inspira-
tion for sketches come from?
A: I like a lot of social com-
mentary stuff. I guess I have a fairly apparent disdain for au-thority . I guess that would be the common thread with a lot of Whitest Kids stuff and the vid-eos I’m doing now.
Q: What was the process of 
arranging songs and skits on your album “Drunk Texts to Myself”?
A: “Drunk Texts to Myself” 
was fun because I tend to send myself drunk texts all the time — like little messages or notes. 
Instead of writing things on the refrigerator door, I’ll just text myself when I’m drunk. But then the next day , I never understand what any of these things are. So, I just said, “I’m going to just take a bunch of them from the last six months and put them to a tune.” So, those are all my actual drunk texts. Those are all real.

prior to the season he would use 
non-conference play to solidify a starting lineup and starting rotation. While he was expected to name a weekend rotation on Wednesday, it won’t be filled with guys who were overly impressive in the Gators’ first 18 games. Besides Jonathon Craw-ford, no UF starter has lasted six innings in a game. After Crawford, the Saturday and Sunday spots will likely be filled by some combination of Jay Carmichael, Tucker Simpson and Eric Hanhold. Those guys have had impressive appearances (espe-cially Carmichael), but none of them have shown they can successfully limit a team like Kentucky, which is hitting .307 this season. The arms just aren’t there to support a lineup that is still struggling to find its col-lective stroke at the plate.
Adam: Age is just a number. Flor -
ida has the arms, and the upcom-
ing series against Kentucky is a test for them. Even if they fail, the Gators can still succeed in the SEC. It’s early. What Florida pitchers haven’t done this season is locate pitches consistently. Keeping the ball down and throwing two of the first three pitches for strikes are in-grained in these players since tee ball. They’re just slumping. They get it. As do the hitters. Give these guys a chance come conference play. This isn’t something that can’t be fixed. Freshman shortstop Richie Martin will provide a boost once he returns from a fractured finger. A schedule that has SEC powers Kentucky and South Carolina visiting Gainesville helps, too. Florida played two straight SEC series on the road last year. That doesn’t happen once in 2013. An easier schedule, coupled a team on the cusp of “getting it,” the Gators will be just fine.

Former Gators linebacker Jon Bostic participates in a drill during Florida’s Pro 
Day on Tuesday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
Gators losing seven 
defensive starters
we head into spring ball.” 
Replicating those results could prove challeng-
ing. Florida’s defense loses seven starters from a 
year ago and will need to find the depth that fos-tered a vast improvement last season.
Juniors Sharrif Floyd, Matt Elam and Jelani Jen-
kins chose to forgo their senior seasons to enter the NFL draft. Seniors Omar Hunter, Lerentee McCray, Jon Bostic and Josh Evans are also gone.  
The group combined for 11 interceptions and 
two fumble recoveries last season, as well as 367 tackles, which represented 48.4 percent of the team’s total. 
Durkin remains unfazed with the challenge that 
awaits him and his staff. 
“We’ve got a great group of guys, great group 
of knowledge that has mutual respect for one an-other,” Durkin said. “We’re all in it for the same thing. We have the same goals, same expectations. 
“To me, it’s just a matter of facilitating things 
and organizing the way we’re going to do it, then getting after it.”

UF wants timely hits
stranded on base. 
She had a strong week-
end, batting .800 against the 
Tigers with an on-base per-centage of .900 — production that earned her SEC Player of the Week honors on Mon-day.
Little was 2 for 3 with 
runners in scoring position against Auburn.
“I just came out ready to 
play,” Little said.
But while the sopho-
more battered the Tigers, the Gators’ biggest bats fell silent in the final two games of the series.
Haeger, who leads Flori-
da in home runs with seven, went 0 for 5 on Saturday and Sunday. She saw her batting average tumble from .397 to .372.
Sophomore Bailey Cas-
tro is tied for second on the team in long balls with five, but she also struggled after Friday’s outburst. She went 0 for 4 in those two games and is now hitting .246.
Despite Florida’s most 
recent struggles, coach Tim Walton thinks the hits will come soon enough.
“It’s just about getting 
timely hits,” he said. “I don’t know that we’re really going to focus on that. I think it’s just finding a way to get on base and do the things that we’re capable of.”

  D.J. Durkin calls it good for-
tune.
  As one of two holdovers from 
Urban Meyer’s staff in 2010 — 
Meyer’s ﬁ  nal year at Florida — Durkin has spent the past three seasons as linebackers coach and special teams coordinator with the Gators.
  But when defensive coordinator 
Dan Quinn left UF to take the same position with the Seattle Seahawks, coach Will Muschamp quickly pro-moted Durkin to ﬁ  ll the vacated role.
  “It’s good timing, I guess, I don’t 
know,” Durkin said of becoming Florida’s defensive coordinator. “I’ve always tried to keep your head down and work as hard as you can, and deal with your play-ers honestly and deal with other coaches honestly and just be who you are. 
  “And it really is, it is good tim-
ing.” 
  Durkin began his coaching ca-reer as a graduate assistant on Mey-er’s Bowling Green staff in 2001. He also spent time as a defensive assistant at Bowling Green, as well as Notre Dame and Stanford before rejoining Meyer at Florida.   He has since made a name for 
himself by leading the Gators’ special teams, a unit that has been largely successful under his guid-ance. In 2012, Florida blocked six kicks, recovered four fumbles and scored two touchdowns on special teams. 
  Durkin hopes to bring the mind-
set that made his special teams unit so successful to his defense. 
  “You’ve seen the identity of our 
defense, what we as a staff have wanted to build here: We want to be a tough, blue-collar team,” Dur-kin said. “We want to play with un-believable effort and enthusiasm in what we’re doing. 
  “That’s the way I coach. That’s 
my personality. That’s what I hope I’ve carried over to our specials teams, and it’d be the same thing with our defense.”
  But Durkin has a tough act to 
follow. Quinn’s second season as defensive coordinator helped revi-talize Florida’s defense.
  In 2011, UF was minus-12 in 
turnover margin, which was 113th in the nation, and the Gators ﬁ  n-ished just 7-6. Last season, Florida ﬁ  nished plus-15, tied for the sev-enth-best margin in the nation and helping the Gators improve to 11-2. 
  “There’s no bigger stat in foot-
ball than turnover margin,” Mus-champ said. “That was emphasized again to our players [Monday] as

  Lauren Haeger stepped to the 
plate with two outs and center ﬁ  elder 
Kirsti Merritt on second base on Sat-urday. 
  Haeger was quickly buried in a 
two-strike count but only needed to ﬁ  nd a hole in the inﬁ  eld to score Mer-ritt with the game-tying run given the freshman’s speed.
  Auburn pitcher Marcy Harper de-
livered a pitch, and the sophomore right-hander sent a ﬂ  y ball to right ﬁ  eld — directly into the glove of Ti-gers outﬁ  elder Branndi Melero to end the game.
  After scoring 13 runs in the series 
opener against Auburn, No. 3 Flori-da’s (25-2, 2-1 Southeastern Confer-ence) offense stagnated with runners in scoring position, going 1 for 9 in the ﬁ  nal two games of the series.
  “It’s always frustrating to leave runners in scoring position,” fresh-man catcher Taylore Fuller said. “It’s part of the game. We just have to learn how to work through it. We have pressure on us to score runs, but we know it’s eventually going to come.”
  The hits 
were nowhere to be found with runners 
on base Saturday and Sunday. The lone knock with a runner in scoring position came in Saturday’s losing ef-fort. Sophomore Briana Little belted a three-run home run with freshman Kelsey Stewart on second and Hae-ger on ﬁ  rst.
  But Little was not immune to the 
Gators’ struggles. She failed to drive in Stewart from third earlier in the game.

    Josh: There’s no shame in what happened 
to the Gators on Tuesday night. Florida lost to an undefeated rival in No. 5 Florida 
State. However, what is cause for alarm is the Gators’ performance against much lesser competition. UF lost to North Florida and was swept by Florida Gulf Coast. How are the Gators supposed to turn things around playing teams from one of the nation’s best conferences every weekend if they can’t take care of business against the Atlantic Sun Con-ference?
  Adam: Baseball is a funny game. There are 
slumps and surprises. Florida has dealt with both this season. I expect the Gators to make their sixth straight NCAA Regional appear-ance. Losing against UNF and Florida Gulf Coast would be a much bigger deal for Flor-ida football. We aren’t talking about pigskin here. 
  Florida has averaged 19.6 SEC wins per sea-
son during coach Kevin O’Sullivan’s tenure. Eight teams from the SEC made the Regionals last year (Missouri and Texas A&M were still playing in the Big 12). They averaged 17 con-ference wins. Florida will get it together in its 30 SEC games. Fresh-men like right-hander Mike Vinson and left-hander Danny Young have improved. Speedy freshman center ﬁ  elder Harrison Bader has started hitting balls on the ground.
  Sometimes it takes longer for players to 
adjust to college baseball. Kind of how you realize girls don’t have cooties anymore. Some people just take more time to ﬁ  gure it out (Josh).
  Josh: Baseball is a funny game, but it’s not 
as funny as you ﬂ  ailing with half your body over the edge of the press box in a futile at-tempt to catch a foul ball. I hope to see more attempts like those.
  On a more serious note, O’Sullivan said  How will baseball fare in SEC?

The spotlight is shining brightly 
on the Gators. Not only does Florida 
hold the highest scores in each event in the NCAA, but its roster contin-ues to improve as it reaches the end of the regular season. 
Led by senior Ashanee Dicker -
son, who has won nine individual titles and is seventh on vault in the nation with a 9.925 average, UF has built on its quality performances down the stretch. 
“Looking at every competition 
we’ve had this year, every time we step away, no matter what the score was or who we were facing… we al-ways step away knowing we can do better,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
The Gators’ final home meet of 
the season proved that. 
Facing No. 14 Minnesota on 
March 1, Florida scored 198.425 points, the highest team score in a meet since 2004. 
Three of the last winners — Ala-
bama, which has won two national titles, and UCLA — failed to top 197.875 during their championship seasons. 
The Crimson Tide recorded 
a season-high 197.85 against the Gators in the NCAA Super Six and put together a season-best total of 197.675 in 2011. 
UF has hit the 198 mark twice 
this season. 
“Even though we had that great 
meet at Alabama and Minnesota, it’s fun to think that we have places to improve on, which is mind-boggling to me,” Jamie Shisler said. “We go into every competition knowing we can hit and knowing what we are ca-pable of, and it’s a calming feeling.”
When Florida lost All-American 
Alaina Johnson to a lower-back inju-ry on Jan. 25, it appeared the Gators would suffer a setback. Johnson, an all-around competitor, was instru-mental in Florida’s record-setting uneven bars performance against Missouri on Jan. 18, a week prior to her injury . 
But instead of stumbling down 
the stretch, the Gators grew stronger and used three program records to top Minnesota and prove they are worthy of their No. 1 ranking this season.
“They genuinely believe that 
they’re the best,” Faehn said.16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 14, 2013

When Sam Farrell ar-
rived at Florida, she wanted 
to be one of the best lacrosse players in the nation. Win-ning the Tewaaraton Award, considered the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy in col-lege lacrosse, was her dream. Four years later, the senior has nearly reached her goal.
Farrell was named to the 
Tewaaraton Award watch list on Feb. 22 along with team-mates Kitty Cullen, Brittany Dashiell and Mikey Meagher.
Farrell never thought she 
would be recognized nation-ally as a defender.
Farrell came to Florida as a 
midfielder. During her fresh-man and sophomore seasons, the coaches thought she could make a bigger impact playing the back line.
“Moving to low [defense] 
was one of the best things to happen to me,” Farrell said.
On Tuesday night, Farrell 
helped the UF defense shut out Lehigh during the first half of an 18-2 win.
Since that switch, Farrell 
has flourished as captain of the Gators’ defensive unit. She anchors the nation’s sixth-best scoring defense, which allows 6.67 goals per game.“Being a part of a great 
defensive unit like this one makes it easier to get noticed,” Farrell said.
Farrell is one of four se-
niors that Florida had on the Tewaaraton Award watch list. Maryland was the only other team with that many.
“To have four young ladies 
represent the University is significant to our program,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “It says where we are within the country, but certainly, in-dividual honors are great for these young ladies.”
Nationally, earning recog-
nition as a defender is difficult. Attackers and midfielders can score goals and record assists, and goalkeepers can boast a high save percentage.
Farrell leads the team with 
12 forced turnovers this sea-son and is tied for third with 14 groundballs.
Only nine of the 50 players 
on the list are defenders.
Nevertheless, O’Leary be-
lieves Farrell deserves recog-nition.
“She just goes out and 
works hard every single day,” O’Leary said.
“Those successes are from 
that hard work. I think she’s the best defender in the coun-try. With her, mediocrity is not an option.”Senior anchoring
