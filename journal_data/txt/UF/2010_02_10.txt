Melting Pot short
changes workers
0 EMPLOYEES HAVE NOT
GOTTEN FINAL PAYCHECKS.
By ROXANNE FRASER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Gainesville Melting Pot
has closed, but the question of em-
ployee payments remains open.
Former employees still have
not received valid final paychecks
or W-2 forms, though the restau-
rant closed in September.
The fondue restaurant, lo-
cated at 418 E University Ave.,
was closed for renovation by the
city and may remain closed ulti-
mately.
"We found out on a Saturday
and, basically, on the Tuesday of
that same week we were closed
down," said Regina Kypriandes,
a former Melting Pot employee.
Employees worked off an IOU
system because the restaurant
didn't have enough money, ac-
cording to Kypriandes."We would get what we made
that night written on a piece on
paper," she said. "We would get
paid when someone's tables paid
in cash."
Kypriandes added employees
either could not cash their final
paychecks or the checks bounced.
Justin Santoro, former fran-
chise manager and owner of the
Gainesville Melting Pot, is work-
ing with attorneys to send out
W-2 forms.
"My main priority is to get my
employees taken care of," Santoro
said.
According to corporate head-
quarters in Tampa, the company
did not know about this issue.
"We were just made aware
this week from prior employees
that they didn't receive their W-2
forms," said Bob Johnston, presi-
dent and chief operating officer of
The Melting Pot.
Santoro said former employees
should receive their W-2 forms
within the week.

IRHA hosts balloon fight
By VINCENT ALVARADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Placed under lock and key in Rawl-
ing's dorm, thousands are waiting to be
released.
For the next three weeks, students will
be gathering in the Rawlings bathrooms
from 4:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. in hopes of filling
140,000 water balloons.
The Inter-Residence Housing Associa-
tion will host a water balloon fight Feb. 27
at 1 p.m. on Flavet Field to raise breast can-
cer awareness.
This is the second time UF is hosting an
event of this kind.
Microsoft set the world record in Austra-
lia at the Xbox 360 launch with about 2,849
participants and 51,000 balloons.
UF fell short in October 2008 by 300 peo-
ple.
The University of Kentucky broke the re-cord in August with an estimated 119,411
balloons and 3,902 people, according to
"The Guinness Book of World Records."
UF junior Roderick Clelland, whose
mother struggled with breast cancer, is a
participant.
"Rain, shine or Armageddon, we're
going to be out there throwing bal-
loons."
Sheldon Clark
event marketing director
Throwing water balloons gets people to
come out and show their support for a dis-
ease that Clelland said could affect anyone.
"Rain, shine or Armageddon, we're go-
ing to be out there throwing balloons," said
Sheldon Clark, the event's marketing direc-
tor.

By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN

Student Body President Jordan
Johnson recommended Tuesday that
graduate assistants should not have to
pay a potential fee to help fund the ex-
pansion of the Reitz Union.
Johnson said his decision is the re-
sult of four months of discussions with
students, faculty and administration.
During this time, Johnson said he's
learned about the financial burdens
faced by graduate assistants, who serve
as research and teaching assistants and
also subsidize the cost of instruction.
"We've had multiple opportunities
for people to speak up and engage in
this conversation, and this is a groupof students who have identified them-
selves as, you know, not being capable
of absorbing another fee," Johnson
said.
Graduate students and undergrad-
uates students would still pay the po-
tential fee, Johnson said.
Johnson said he plans to talk with
the Board of Trust-
Student ees about his deci-Government sion at the board's
next meetings on
March 15 and 16.
Matt Vernon, vice president for
Graduate Assistants United, said grad-
uate assistants are very pleased with
the new stance on the fee.
"The entire objection of the GA
community was that, financially, we
are very strapped," he said.

RUB offers students
chance to find love
By TATIANA QUIROGA
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students looking for a little
love in the lonely days before Valen-
tine's Day got their chance at the Re-
itz Union Board of Entertainment's
second annual Dating Game at the
Orange & Brew Tuesday night.
The event consisted of three
rounds in which one contestant
asked questions to three or four con-
testants of the opposite sex and then
chose his or her favorite based on
those responses.
About 60 audience members
cheered as participants answered
questions ranging from "Do you
like to cook?" to "What's the best
thing about being single?"
"We wanted to do something
Valentine's Day related," said Tif-
fany Whitten, RUB Entertainment'slecturers and comedians director. "It
was a big hit last year. Whether they
find love or not, it's still a fun, inter-
active game.
Sara Patton, a first-year account-
ing graduate student, said she
hoped to meet new people at the
game show.

The U.S. Department of Education should
be dismantled and the money from the depart-
ment given to individual states, according to a
five-judge panel at the inaugural Great GatorDebaters policy debate Tuesday between the
Military Law Student Association and Esquire,
the Society of Minority Pre-law Students.
About 100 people gathered in the Reitz
Union Grand Ballroom to hear the two sides
argue about the best way to lessen racial dis-
parity in the public education system.The Esquire Minority Law Society, rep-
resented by Andre Haughton, a political sci-
ence junior, and Leonard Thompson, a UF
freshman, said the U.S. government is making
strides in closing the racial gap in schools. Full
equality is possible, they said, if federal fund-
ing to programs are increased.
The Military Law Student Association, rep-
resented by Tara Tedrow and Corey Squires,both first-year law students, said the federal
government is incapable of bringing about
positive change in education. Local govern-
ments are better suited to solve the problem,
they said.
After 45 minutes of debate, the panel, which
included local attorneys and debate coaches,
decided 3 votes to 2 votes to name the Military
Law Student Association the winners.

A 10-foot Christmas tree stands
in the corner of Monica Leadon
Cooper's living room.
Although the holiday season
ended nearly two months ago,
she's been too busy planning
her mayoral campaign to take it
down.
The 55-year-old musician and
local nutrition business owner
said she's ready to lead the town

years.
"I think we need some new

she will scrutinize the city budget
and eliminate wasteful spending.
She pointed to Mom's Kitchen,
which she said the city purchased
for $160,000.
The building remains unused.
She also pointed to Koppers
Inc.'s cleanup efforts and the resi-
dents surrounding the site who
have felt the repercussions of con-
taminated soil and drinking water.
This issue is personal for Coo-
per because she lives within two
miles of the industrial site.
"I will not settle for anything
less than residential standards,"
she said.
But she also knows a voice isn't
always enough in the political are-
na.
"You can have an opinion, but
it's better to have a vote," she said,

after her seven-year tenure on the

* ABOUT 60 ATTENDED THE SPEECH.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
In the mind of Chaplain Khalid Latif, there is no divide
between the practice of Islam and the acceptance of cul-
tural diversity.
Latif, 27, is the Chaplain of New York University and
the New York City Police Department.
He spoke to more than 60 people Tuesday night in the
Reitz Union's Rion Ballroom. The event was organized
by UF's Islam on Campus as part of Islam Awareness
Month.
"It is most definitely acceptable for a variety of cultures
to exist within the Muslim paradigm," he said.
Latif discussed the complexities of addressing Muslim
diversity.
He emphasized that Islamic tradition calls for diversity
while noting that some people just don't get it.
"You see a lot of people who just don't know how to
deal with people who are not like themselves," he said.
Through his work at NYU, he has firsthand experience
with misconceptions about what it means to be a Muslim.
He told a story of a conversation he had with a young
Japanese woman who was afraid to convert to Islam.
When Latif asked her why, she said she had heard from
older Muslims that, if she converted, she would have to
marry a Japanese man to be a good Muslim.
Latif could not believe it.
"That is actually the furthest thing from anything that
can be remotely called Islam," he said.
Karim Khan, a microbiology and political science soph-
omore, said he appreciated how Latif was able to highlight
the differences in perspective between older and younger
Muslims.
"I can relate a lot to not being able to relate to my par-
ents' culture," he said.
Ali was impressed with Latif's scholarly knowledge of
the faith, especially for his age.
After the speech, Latif suggested community service
as a way of uniting students across faiths to better under-
stand diversity in religion.
"You don't have to be of a certain faith to paint a house,
to tutor a kid or serve someone a hot meal," he said.
He was paid $1,200 to speak, according to Ismail ibn
Ali, Islam on Campus president.

Move it, move it
First lady's exercise
campaign unrealisticMichelle Obama launched the "Let's Move" cam-
paign to end childhood obesity Tuesday. While
the Editorial Board knows the program will suc-
ceed to the same extent the "Just Say No" campaign did,
we question the methods the first lady plans to use to fix
the growing problem by 2020. (She thinks America can
kick this habit in a decade? Really?)
Even the campaign's official site admits the most dif-
ficult obstacle in creating a healthier nation is the lack of
affordable and accessible nutritional food.
As any college student strapped for cash can testify, it's
difficult not to choose a Totino's pizza over a navel orange
when they both cost around a dollar.
Junk food is just cheap. Healthier food isn't.
We don't see how either Obama could help right that
wrong, especially given a bad economy. We know the first
lady was only thinking of the children when she launched
the program, but she should have considered her timing,
too.
We also object to the saccharine-sweet programming
bound to result from the first lady's cooperation with Dis-
ney in spreading the word about healthy lifestyles. As if
the "very special episode" disease wasn't bad enough,
government-inspired Hannah Montana shows about
working out sound cringe-worthy.
Unlike some people, we don't see this program as pro-
paganda. We just think it'll make our little cousins and
siblings annoying as hell when we explain why we haven't
been to the gym in a month.
Buzzed
Social media seems tohave settled down into
its middle age. People
are happily married to their
Twitter accounts and Face-
book pages, some are stuck
with Myspace, their high
school sweetheart. A few
even ended up with the
strange one from the bar like
Dogbook or Stache Passion.
Well, Google announced
Monday that it wants to play
the part of toned pool boy
or steamy secretary home-
wrecker with its new prod-
uct Google Buzz.
The new platform is de-
scribed as being similar to
Facebook's status update,
with sharing of links, pho-
tos and videos readily sup-
ported.
The major difference is
that Google Buzz will live
inside Gmail, which already
has over 100 million users,making the social experience
more message based than
profile based.
Buzz automatically con-
verts all Gmail contacts to
the Facebook equivalent of
friends (or the Twitter equiv-
alent of followers), allowing
you to post your favorite
LOLcat photo simultaneous-
ly to friends, coworkers and
that project partner from two
semesters ago.
Luckily, Google has in-
cluded a feature that many
Facebook users have been
screaming for, a "dislike"-
esque button which will
teach Buzz to filter out the
annoying and unwanted.
Once again, Google has
created a tempting product
that prompts the question,
how much information are
we willing to turn over to a
single company to enhance
our online experience?

SG opposes union fee for grad assistants
uring my time as Student Body President, I haveconstantly tried to work with any student that
has an opinion about how Student Government
can improve the lives of students at UF.
This has been the case when discussing issues of
promoting safe transportation for students, protecting
students' interests during the first wave of budget cuts
and providing more options for late-night study areas
on campus.
The issue of the rebuilding of the Reitz Union has
been no different. That's why when the first concerns
were raised about the future of the building, I began
talking with students about how we could best solve
this issue.
This is how I first learned of the burdens our gradu-
ate assistants face at this university. While basically act-
ing to subsidize our education here at UF, these valu-
able members of our community remain underpaid and
overworked and are expected to help carry the load of
teaching for our esteemed faculty with little recogni-
tion.
They deserve better. That's why I will be proposing at
the next Board of Trustees Meeting that all UF students
classified as graduate research assistants and teaching
assistants who receive tuition waivers be exempt from
any future fees that may be levied for the rebuilding of
the Reitz Union.
While working for the university, graduate assistants
have only seen their fees increase, a trend that is likely
to continue without a major shift in policy.
In order to counter this, I also plan to insist on pay
raises for graduate assistants to help ease the burden of
existing fees. It has been demonstrated to me that these
students, who essentially teach about half of the classesJordan Johnson
Speaking Outat UF, contribute a substantial
amount to this university. If UF is
to remain the first-rate university
that is, we have to do more for our
graduate students.
However, our mission to rebuild the Reitz Union has
not changed.
We all know that the Reitz Union will need drastic
repairs along with substantial expansion to accommo-
date the growing needs of our student body. A student
fee, coupled with private donations and state funding,
is the most viable option to do this.
Tomorrow's student union will benefit graduate stu-
dents and undergraduates alike while providing more
space to study, gather, meet and eat.
We will take a union built for a student body of
19,000 in the 1960s and turn it into today's heart of The
Gator Nation.
Our new student union will exemplify a place where
a diverse Student Body of today and tomorrow can in-
teract, learn and experience campus life.
I did not come to this decision easily, and I want
to thank everyone who engaged me in this discussion
about the future of the Reitz Union. This includes the
leaders in the graduate student and undergrad commu-
nities with whom I met over the past few months.
Now, I would like to challenge you, the Student Body,
to engage in this debate over rebuilding the union.
It is my honest belief that you will come to the same
conclusion that I have: It is time to invest in the Reitz
Union and time to improve the student experience for
our entire Student Body.
Go out and ensure your voice is heard by voting in
the spring SG elections. Go Gators!

Guest Column
Animal rights debate to inform students
vice president of policyand governmental affairs for
People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals (PETA), I have
debated animal protection issues
around the world.
But a funny thing happened sev-
en or eight years ago: The other side
stopped showing up.
Even though the livestock indus-
try makes billions of dollars on the
backs of unwilling animals every
year, its representatives don't often
want to defend it. Thankfully, UF's
College Republicans are up to the
task.
Last October, I came to UF to dis-
cuss the cruelty and environmental
devastation inherent in today's live-
stock industry.
Bryan Griffin, chairman of the UF
College Republicans, did not attend.
If he had, he probably would not
have told the Alligator at the People
Eating Tasty Animals Barbecue that
"loving animals does not exclude
you from eating meat."
To be clear, PETA does not believe
that animal rights is a partisan issue
-we believe quite the contrary.
In a cover story for The Ameri-
can Conservative, Matthew Scully,
former speechwriter for President
George W. Bush, argued that "whenBruce Friedrich we live off a
Speaking Out cruel and dis-
graceful thing
like factory
farming, we are to that extent living
unjustly, and that is hardly a trivial
problem," regardless of other ben-
efits we individually contribute to
society.
But if the College Republicans
feel strongly that torturing animals
for our meals is acceptable, we are
happy to have that discussion.
Cows, turkeys, pigs and chickens
living on factory farms and dying in
slaughterhouses face abuses so se-
vere that they could warrant felony
cruelty to animals charges if dogs or
cats were the victims.
Would someone who knew these
facts then turn around and organize
a barbecue in protest of a group
seeking to inform people of such
suffering, as Griffin and his organi-
zation did?
In light of the cruelty of meat pro-
duction, I was interested to hear his
justification for eating meat, so we
challenged the College Republicans
to a formal debate on whether ani-
mals should have rights.
To their credit, and my surprise,
they quickly agreed to participate.
I was surprised because findingpeople to make the case that such
cruelty is acceptable is no easy task.
Last spring, for example, I chal-
lenged the dean of Michigan State
University's College of Agriculture
and Natural Resources to a debate
on the ethics of eating meat.
He is chair of the United Egg Pro-
ducers Animal Welfare Advisory
Committee and is an adviser to Mc-
Donald's on animal welfare issues.
He refused to debate.
A University of Georgia profes-
sor in the Poultry Science Depart-
ment and an adviser to Kentucky
Fried Chicken on animal welfare
standards, has also declined.
If I included the full list of "re-
spected" industry representatives
who have responded in kind, this
column would be too long to print.
Thankfully, this is a debate that
UF students want to see, and I'm ex-
cited to participate.
I encourage people of all back-
grounds and viewpoints to attend
"The Great Animal Rights Debate"
at 11:30 a.m. Friday in FAB 105. En-
joy the free food, listen to the discus-
sion and decide for yourself what's
ethical.

of policy and governmental affairs for
PETA.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
Letter to the Editor
Letter stating the military doesn't want homo-
sexuals to serve is inflammatory, absurd
Matt Simmons' letter in Monday's Alligator
absolutely infuriated me. It was so full of fallacies
and ignorant homophobic assumptions that I don't
know where to begin.
I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps
and served proudly in two combat tours of duty.
The law of averages tells you that I would have had
to have served with a number of men who identify
themselves as homosexual. If they were, I had no
clue. Their sexual preference did not make them any
less of a Marine, or for that matter, any less of a hero
for answering the call to duty -something Sim-
mons obviously knows nothing about.
For Simmons to say that 99.9 percent of the mili-
tary don't want homosexuals in its ranks is absolute-
ly outrageous, inflammatory and absurd. One has to
assume by lack of any specific details that Simmons
neither served in the military nor received an educa-
tion past the eighth grade.
For the Alligator to even bother printing this rub-
bish boggles the mind. In addition, it disturbs me
that in the year 2010, we still have individuals who
think the way Simmons does. What is even scarier is
how he obviously aligns himself with the conserva-
tive/republican movement.
I am truly embarrassed that this person is a part
of humanity and actually has a say in society. Please
do us all a favor and refrain from ever printing his
letters again so that he may disappear into the back-
woods from which he came.

SOFTBALL, from page 15
bit higher than initial expectations."
The shift allows Bruder to stay
in a position where she made the
All-Southeastern Conference defen-
sive team last year, and moves Bush
away from the spot where she had
only a .937 career fielding percentage
and led the team with 10 errors last
season.
"We have a good combo going
with Megan and our new freshman
Brittany Walker mixing at short and
Megan taking over some duties at
first," Bruder said. "She looks great
over there."
Rounding out the infield are All-
SEC second baseman Aja Paculba
and senior stalwart Corrie Brooks at
third base.
The speedy Paculba will once
again be batting leadoff, where she
will use her ability to hit for a high
average and her propensity for draw-
ing walks to set the table for Frances-
ca Enea, Bruder and Tiffany DeFelice
in the three, four and five spots.
"We're far from having the great
scoring machine we're looking for,
and this is close to what I'd like to
have, but the speed-power-average
balance is in place for sure," Walton
said.
As for Brooks, she's been a con-
stant presence at UF over the last
three years, starting in a total of 200games and drastically improving her
batting average each year.
When talking about UF's leader-
ship, Walton cited Brooks as one of
the players who leads by example.
"Corrie doesn't say or do a whole
lot as far as being a leader goes, she
just goes out and plays ball," Walton
said. "She goes out and plays hard
every day."
Having players with the Brooks'
mentality should come in handy on a
team loaded with freshman talent.
"(Walker and Brittany Schutte)
are going to be opening day start-
ers, and we're looking for some good
things out of the two of them," Wal-
ton said. "The other two that could
see some significant time in the first
weekend, (Samantha) Holle and
(Kelsey) Horton, can do some things
too. They've both had good falls and
both are working hard."
Still, Walton doesn't expect a ros-
ter with only two seniors compared
to seven freshmen to have any issues
with leadership.
"We lead a little differently,"
Walton said. "When you talk about
a female sport and female athletes
it's hard to pick one individual that's
typically a leader.
"There's a lot from the junior class
in terms of leadership, personality,
and a little more flare, and there's
where the leadership is going to
come from."- .7.--

But rather How did Florida basketball
three years removed from back-to-back na-
tional championships -reach the point where
a player like Dan Werner is the best option to
log those 29 minutes per game?
Whether it has been bad luck or bad recruit-
ing -or both -Donovan and the Gators find
themselves here for four main reasons:
1. The early departures of Marreese Speights
and Nick Calathes for professional careers.
2. The decisions to transfer by Jai Lucas,
Jonathan Mitchell, Allan Chaney, Eloy Vargas
and Brandon Powell.
3. The injuries sustained by Adam Allen
and Kenny Kadji.
4. The lack of development by Shipman and
Murphy.
All those things left Donovan with five
functional players plus Werner, who toes theline between functional and comatose.
And so Werner continues to play even
though he has scored two points or less 10
times this season, and 10 points or more only
four times this season.
He continues to play even though he has
failed to make more than one shot from the
field on 13 occasions, including his current
eight-game streak.
And many fans who can't remember what
it was like to have Chris Richard as the first
player off the bench will say that Werner's val-
ue isn't in scoring points, ripping down boards
and dishing out assists. Instead, Werner shows
up to work every day ready to set screens, dive
for loose balls and play smart-help defense
with his lunch pale in hand.
The little things are important, but there was
a time in Gainesville not too long ago when a
player occasionally needed to bring his jump
shot, athleticism and ballhandling if he was to
log 29 minutes per game.

UF looks to limit Downey
0 THE GATORS AND GAMECOCKS TIP
OFF AT 8 TONIGHT IN COLUMBIA, S.C.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
There's no easy way to stop South Caro-
lina guard Devan Downey.
When asked how he plans to do so, UF
coach Billy Donovan gave a desperate re-
sponse.
"Go to church and pray," Donovan said.
Downey scored 36 points against the
Gators in Gainesville on Jan. 23, and he's
been nearly as impressive against the rest of
the Southeastern Conference.
The 5-foot-9 guard is averaging 30.9 points,
taking 22.5 field-goal attempts and getting to
the line 9.25 times per league game.
"I wish I could sit here and say, 'OK,
we're going to make him go left every time
and he's never going to score,"' Donovan
said. "He gets 30 for a reason against every-
body. He's really a problem."
Florida will get another chance to try to
stop Downey tonight at 8, when the Gators
take on the Gamecocks in the Colonial Cen-
ter in Columbia, S.C.
"He has the whole package," Donovan
said. "He has deep three-point range. He can
stop on a dime and shoot runners. He goes to
the free-throw line eight to ten times a game.
When he gets in the lane, he's one of the few
guys I've seen at his size that plays like a
monster in the paint."
The only thing that might slow down
Downey is his health entering the game. Ac-
cording to The State, he did not practice and
wore a protective boot Tuesday after rollinghis ankle Monday, but he is still expected to
play tonight.
When preparing to face an elite player like
Downey, UF usually designates someone to
simulate that player in practice. Sophomore
point guard Erving Walker said Downey's
skill set kept the Gators from finding one
player to mimic him.
"He has so much freedom on that team.
He's pretty much going to get his," Walker
said. "It's hard to stop a player like that.
"He's probably half of their offense, may-
be more than half, so we expect him to shoot
a lot of shots -I'd say at least once every
other time."
Walker's estimation isn't that far off based
Donovanon Downey's statistics in
conference play.
Downey has taken 180
shots, more than twice as
many as the next South
Carolina player (Sam Mul-
drow, 87) and 37.6 percent
of his team's output.
Even though everyone
knows the Gamecocks offense runs through
Downey, Donovan said it's nearly impossible
to keep him from taking that many shots.
He took 25 in the O'Connell Center last
month, and no matter what defense the
Gators threw at him, he found a shot.
On the Gamecocks' last possession,
Downey drove the length of the court, burned
UF's entire team and banked in an improb-
able floater to put his team up by one.
"I don't think you can just eliminate his
shots," Donovan said. "There were things
we tried to do, trapping him at the end of the
game, that were very ineffective because he

Gators shake up infield
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
At the end of the 2009 season, the
general consensus was that the 2010
UF softball team's infield would fea-
ture a quartet of upperclassmen ready
to build on the excellence of the 2009
unit.
It only took one freshman to change
that plan around completely.
Freshman shortstop Brittany
Walker from Tomball, Texas, has par-
layed some excellent work in practice
and a stellar fall season into a spot inthe starting lineup.
Her emergence, along with Me-
gan Bush's successful transition over
to first base, has led to
coach Tim Walton de-
ciding to keep junior
Kelsey Bruder in the
Softball outfield for at least one
more season.
"Brittany Walker
was probably the biggest factor (in
the decision)," Walton said. "Her abil-
ity to play the infield is maybe a little
SEE SOFTBALL, PAGE 14Werner gives little more than minutes
fall the twists and turns in Florida's un-likely basketball season, there's one fact
that I can't wrap my mind around.
It isn't the win against then-No. 2 Michigan
State or the ensuing top-10 national ranking.
It isn't the back-to-back losses to Richmond
and South Alabama.
And it isn't the Chandler Parsons' buzzer-
beaters, either.
The thing I can't understand is how Dan
Werner is averaging almost 29 minutes per
game, a career high, while setting career lows
in nearly every meaningful statistical category.
The senior forward is averaging 5.2 points,
4.3 rebounds and 2.1 assists while shooting 34.5
percent from the field and 28.8 from three.
In Southeastern Conference play, it's even
worse. Werner is logging 3.4 points per outing
while shooting 24.2 percent shooting from the
field and 17.6 percent shooting from three.As for his in-confer-
_ _ _ ence rebounding num-
bers, Werner has pulled
down exactly one more
rebound than 5-foot-8
guard Erving Walker.
Kyle Maistri Despite all of that
Kyle Points damning statistical evi-
kmya istri@aIigator org dence, I actually agreewith the argument that
Dan Werner is playing
nearly 29 minutes per game because he's the
best option UF coach Billy Donovan has.
Somehow, Ray Shipman and Erik Murphy
haven't earned playing time by proving they
can help the team win more than Werner.
So perhaps the most baffling question isn't:
How is Dan Werner logging 29 minutes every
night as a zero-sum basketball player?

Florida getting the
most from its bench
0 JORDAN JONES SCORED
21 POINTS AS A RESERVE
SUNDAY.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a IIigator org
Jordan Jones started Sunday's
game against Mississippi State in an
unfamiliar position: on the bench.
Her name wasn't blared as part
of the starting lineup, as it had been
in 21 of UF's previous 22 contests,
but that didn't bother Jones.
"I've done it twice this season,
and we're 2-0," Jones said. "I've had
pretty decent games. It puts a chip
on my shoulder -not to prove
coach Butler wrong -but to show
where I belong."
Coming off the bench for the
first time since Nov. 29 -when
she scored a season-high 25 points
-Jones scored a game-high 21 en
route to an 80-78 double-overtime
win over the Bulldogs.
Jones is the Gators'leading scorer
at 9.9 points per game, but she aver-aged just 6.2 points in Southeastern
Conference play prior to MSU.
That didn't change when Jones
first came into the game, as she was
held scoreless for nearly seven min-
utes after taking the court.
But with 5:22 remaining in the
first half, she hit a layup, was fouled
and drained the ensuing free throw,
her first of an 11-for-11 day from the
charity stripe. After that free throw,
Jones added 18 more for her second-
highest scoring game of the season.
Part of her performance was due
to observing the opposing defense
before she went out on the court.
"Coming off the bench is a place
where you can sit back and see how
the flow of the game is going," Jones
said.
She wasn't the only starter rel-
egated to the bench. Azania Stewart,
a 20-game starter, also sat out early.
Stewart added seven points and
six rebounds, giving the Gators'
bench even more depth.
"Having bench players, always
one of our targets is to outscore the
opponents' bench because we do
have a great bench," Stewart said.Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

Gators fall to 12th place after struggling in second round
UF will play its final round today
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
With 36 holes completed and one round
left in the Northrop Grumman Regional Chal-
lenge in Palos Verdes, Calif., the UF women's
golf team dropped two spots to 12th place.
The squad shot a 309 (+25) on Tuesday,
bringing its total to 613 (+45).
"Obviously, we are capable of much better
than what we have shown the last two days,"head coach Jan Dowling said. "We've got to
keep looking at the positives, we've got to
continue working hard and take a good hon-
est look at our last two rounds. Hopefully, we
play tomorrow depending on the weather."
Freshman Isabelle Lendl led the Gators
with a two-round total of 149 (79-70, +7). She
shot a new career-low of 70 (-1) in her second
18. Lendl moved up 35 spots and is currently
tied for 20th place.
"The great thing about this team is thatthey've got a lot of potential and a lot of talent
and some of that is just taking advantage of
the golf course," Dowling said. "When things
don't quite go your way, you've got to make
sure that you understand that
h you're a great player.
"Isabelle played very well
today and I was very happy to
Golf see her shoot the scores that she
Gof shot today."
On the flip side, UF's leader
on Monday, junior Jessica Yadloczky, dropped
to 45th place after adding nine strokes for a to-
tal of 155 (73-82, +13)."It's a difficult golf course," Dowling said.
"If you're not feeling comfortable, that course
can really eat you up pretty quickly. The round
got away from her [Yadloczkyl a little bit, but
it's not Jessica, it's not the way she normally
plays."
Matching her previous round's score,
sophomore Marika Lendl finished Tuesday
with a two-round total of 154 (+12).
Lendl double-bogied on her second hole,
but quickly redeemed herself with nine pars
and two birdies.
Her 36-hole score is good for a 40th-place
tie.
