After a collision at the corner of West University Avenue and 12th Street, a man is loaded into an 
ambulance. His green Miata was struck by a maroon Audi after he attempted to make a left onto 12th Street. The Miata was left in the eastbound lane after stopping to avoid hitting Dwayne Lord, 42, who was crossing 12th Street headed toward Mellow Mushroom for pizza, Lord said.

In an effort to become health-
ier and cleaner, UF will ban to-
bacco  on its main campus begin-ning in July, joining more than 100 campuses across the U.S. that 
have already gone smoke free.
The campus-wide ban will in-
clude all types of tobacco.
Providing a preview of the 
new policy, UF’s Health Science 
Center and all Shands Health-Care buildings will go tobacco free on Nov. 1.
The new policy was proposed 
by UF’s Healthy Gators 2010 Co-alition, an organization of stu-dents, faculty and staff.
UF President Bernie Machen 
approved the policy, and 64 per-cent of student voters approved it on spring ballots. 
Enforcement of the tobacco 
ban will rely on building admin-
istrators and peer pressure to 
keep tobacco at bay, UF spokes-man Steve Orlando said, the same way the current 50-foot rule is enforced.
“There’s not gonna be of-
ficers handing out tickets,” he said. “It’s really going to be more word of mouth.
“Our hope is that everybody 
will realize it’s the right thing to do,” Orlando said.
Employees caught smoking 
on campus could face conse-quences from supervisors, he said, including negative com-ments in their evaluations.
Almost 9 percent of students 
reported smoking a cigarette in 
the last 30 days, according to a 
UF study from fall 2008, and it is estimated that about 17 percent of UF employees smoke.
According to Jill Varnes, UF 
professor of health education and behavior and vice chair of UF campus to 
ban tobacco
A UF graduate student who was arrested in 
April for groping a woman in front of Library 
West after telling her he was removing a bug from her body will plead no contest on Friday.
Robin Garg, 23, will likely face a few more 
months in jail and about three years of proba-tion, said Geoffrey Mason, the suspect’s lawyer. He could also be deported when he is released. He has been in jail since his arrest on April 14.
He asked a judge on Friday for more time to 
enter a plea.
Wearing a loose-fitting, green-striped in-
mate outfit and glasses, Garg spoke softly.
After he was arrested in April, he confessed 
to groping 33 women on campus because he “liked to scare women,” according to Univer-sity Police Department.
UPD said in April that 31 women said they’d 
been touched by Garg, and five others said they were approached.
Some of the women did not file charges.As a result, 25 cases of misdemeanor battery 
are currently pending against Garg.Under an agreement, he will plead no con-
test to five counts of battery, and the other 19 cases will be dropped, Mason said.
The deal depends on the results of a psycho-
logical evaluation that will determine if Garg 
has a mental illness that makes him a risk to 
others. The evaluation should be completed 
this week, Mason said.
After the plea, Garg will 
not be allowed any contact with UF or any of his alleged victims, he said.
A U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement de-
tainer has also been placed 
on Garg, which means he could be deported to his 
home country, India, when he is released from jail, according to an ICE spokeswoman.
“He’s from a different society, different up-
bringing,” he said. “He’s a nice guy, but wrong place, wrong time, wrong situation.”

A proposed statewide “pay-as-
you-throw” program would charge 
residents based on how much trash they throw out and increase state re-cycling requirements for businesses and apartments.
The city of Gainesville already 
mandates both.
The Department of Environmen-
tal Protection proposed the changes to the state legislature. The plan includes making the 75 
percent recycling rate mandatory for larger cities and counties and requir-
ing recycling at busi-nesses and apartment complexes, which are often not required to recycle. 
However, apartment complexes 
in the city of Gainesville are required to recycle according to  Gina Hawk-ins, director of the City of Gainesville 
Public Works Department. State may charge by 
amount thrown out

The Gainesville Police Department has 
reported 12 robberies since Friday and offi-
cials are urging victims to call 911 as soon as possible after the attack.
Although GPD is working hard to catch 
suspects, spokesman Keith Kameg said the victims need to pick up the slack.
“Students have to break the chain of call-
ing their family or friends and then the po-lice,” Kameg said. 
The sooner officers reach the crime scene, the more likely they are to catch the robber, Kameg said.
He said the majority of the robberies in 
Gainesville are occurring on or near South-west 20th Avenue and the victims are most-ly Hispanic. The area was just annexed to Gainesville on June 1.
In light of this “violent summer,” Kameg 
said GPD will release changes to its strategy on how to combat the increase of robberies.

In an e-mail, Bauer told 
Close he wanted to “feel out the situation (in Kurdistan) and get some ideas for deeper stories.”

Strong quake hits Mexico’s 
Gulf of California 
MEXICO CITY (AP) — A 
powerful earthquake Monday 
shook fishing villages along 
Mexico’s Gulf of California and 
prompted alarm as far away as Phoenix, but there were no im-mediate reports of injuries or 
damage.
The U.S. National Earth-
quake Information Center said 
the 6.9-magnitude quake struck at 12:59 p.m. (1:59 EDT, 17:59 
GMT) and was centered 76 
miles (122 kilometers) in Baja California and 331 miles (533 kilometers) southeast of the 
border city of Tijuana.
It was the strongest of four 
quakes of 5.0-magnitude or 
greater that struck the area over a 45-minute period late Monday 
morning. dent transformed FIU into

Terror as turbulence hurts 
26 on Rio-Houston plane 
MIAMI (AP) — Some pas-
sengers were snoozing while 
others snacked when the first 
turbulence rattled Continental 
Flight 128 over the Atlantic. Suddenly, the jetliner began to plunge and shake violently, 
hurling passengers over seat 
backs and slamming them against luggage bins.
The Boeing 767 made an 
emergency landing in Miami 
early Monday so at least 26 
injured, four seriously, could receive medical help. 
But the sudden turbulence 
that rocked the overnight flight from Rio de Janeiro was an all-too-real reminder of an Air France flight — also trav-eling from Rio — that crashed 
into the mid-Atlantic in June 
during thunderstorms, killing all 228 people on board.
“I immediately thought 
of the Air France flight, that we’re going to fall. We’re go-ing to fall,” said Herman Op-penheimer of Rio, one of 179 people on the flight.
Said 20-year-old passenger 
Camila Machado, who was going to Las Vegas and was treated for a bruised cheek: “I 
felt like the airplane was go-
ing to crash. I felt like we were going to die. Like, the first thing I thought about was Air France.”
Federal Aviation Admin-
istration spokeswoman Kath-leen Bergen cautioned against drawing any parallels be-tween the two flights and said 
the cause and severity of the 
turbulence in the Continental case was still being investi-gated.
“I wouldn’t draw any con-
clusions,” Bergen said.

Brazilian singer claims       
racial slurs on AA flight 
MIAMI (AP) — A Brazilian 
singer claims in a lawsuit he 
was the target of racial slurs by 
American Airlines flight atten-
dants during a flight last year.
The lawsuit filed in Miami 
federal court last week by singer 
Dudu Nobre, his wife and pro-
ducer seeks $4 million in dam-ages.
Nobre, who is black, claims 
one flight attendant repeatedly 
called him a “monkey” in Portu-
guese and made “monkey-like” sounds and gestures during the flight from New York to Sao 
Paulo, Brazil.
As Nobre’s group was de-
planing, the lawsuit said one 
flight attendant threatened to start a fight and stabbed No-
bre’s producer with a sharp 
metal pen.
The lawsuit claims the pen 
cut a hole in the producer’s jack-
et and left a scar.
American Airlines officials 
declined comment Monday.
Fla. victim identified          
decades after her killing 
FORT LAUDERDALE (AP) — 
A woman found slain a quarter 
century ago in Florida has been 
identified after relatives read 
about her case on a sheriff’s Web site for unidentified victims.
Officials in the Broward Sher-
iff’s Office said Monday that the brother and sisters of Mary Ann Lambert led them to a positive identification of the woman’s re-mains through the “Found and 
Forgotten” program. Lambert’s 
body was found in a field in Pom-pano Beach in September 1983. She was 21, and police won’t say how she died.
Authorities said a key clue 
was a front tooth that Lambert chipped as a child growing up in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
Partial fingerprints that were 
resubmitted to a state lab in 2008 were also important. Detectives hope the break could help them solve the killing.

� T-MOBILE USERS MUST RESPOND 
TO RECEIVE FUTURE MESSAGES.
UF will test its new emergency text mes-
saging system Thursday in an attempt to 
reach about 67,000 registered students, fac-ulty and staff.
The test will be the first with UF’s new 
provider, ConnectED.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said UF’s 
decision to replace Mobile Campus was not 
directly related to the incident in January 
when a former employee of the company 
sent a message to about 40,000 students, 
faculty and staff that read: “The monkey 
got out of the cage.”
Orlando said the university switched 
providers to get better service after the 
Mobile Campus contract expired. He said ConnectED can send up to three million text messages per hour.
The test will take place between 1 p.m. 
and 9 p.m. Users should get 
a text message Wednesday 
notifying them of the test. All 
students should get the mes-
sage because they are required to register for the service before enrolling in classes, 
he said. Registration is optional for faculty and staff.
Those who use T-Mobile must respond 
to Thursday’s message to receive future emergency messages.
UF tries to test its service four times a 
year, Orlando said. When UF sent out an 
emergency alert about Hurricane Fay in 
August of 2008 about 48,823 phones re-
ceived the message out of about 71,000.

At Camp Kesem, Brian Shelton 
goes by Cookie Monster.  
The nickname for the UF senior 
and co-chairman is one of many 
lighthearted names for volunteers at the camp for families dealing 
with cancer. Other counselors go by Fity, Mr. Snuffy and Blue 
Cheese. 
Located on 22 college campus-
es, Camp Kesem is a national, stu-
dent-run organization that focuses on the emotional needs of children, 
ages 6 through 13, whose parents have had or currently have cancer, 
said Carly Blustein, UF  senior and co-chairwoman of the organiza-
tion. 
Camp Kesem at UF began in 
April 2007 and will host its second overnight camp in Orange Springs, Fla., Sunday through Aug. 14. The camp is free for families and allows the children to be around other 
kids who are going through the same experiences, Blustein said. 
It is a week for kids to just be 
kids, she said. 
For example, Shelton said the 
male counselors once allowed the little girls to dress them as prin-cesses, placing glittery crowns 
on their heads and gluing paper hearts to their faces.
“The camp is a great oppor-
tunity for the children to escape from the stress and enjoy them-selves without being away from 
their families for too long,” Shelton 
said. 
He added that he can relate to 
the campers because his mother 
was diagnosed with cancer when 
he was 12 years old. He said he thinks the camp offers support and care, which is important for children who are coping with their parents’ illnesses.
Stephanie Parks, who is battling 
breast cancer, will have three chil-dren attending camp this summer. 
Her son Matthew, 10, and daugh-
ter Taylor, 11, will return for their second year.
But for her 9-year-old daughter, 
Catie, this year’s camp will be a new experience.
Parks, 42, said Catie did not ac-
company her siblings last year be-cause Catie was worried that her mother would die while she was away.
Parks was first diagnosed with 
breast cancer in 2001. The cancer 
returned in 2007, and she has stage 
IV breast cancer. 
“The camp is amazing because 
it allows my children to meet other 
kids who are in the same position,” she said. “They were able to see 
that our situation could be worse.”
Parks said the camp environ-
ment is positive for her children 
and believes it helps them cope 
with her illness. 
“Matthew came home last sum-
mer and said he forgot that I had cancer,” she said. “It is such a huge 
part of our lives, and to know that 
he hadn’t worried about it made 
me feel great.”
Throughout the year, the stu-
dent-members of Camp Kesem or-ganize advertising, camp activities 
and fundraising.
“The camp is funded through 
donations and fundraisers,” Blus-
tein said. “We work tirelessly throughout the year to raise enough 
money to hold the camp,” 
The organization must raise 
about $11,000 to offer the free re-
treat to families.  
The raised money covers the 
costs of a nurse and child therapist, 
food, arts and crafts and many oth-
er necessities.
The organization is always 
searching for student counselors, 
Blustein said.
The more awareness there is, 
the more children the organization 
can help, she said.
“I want to know dedicated 
people will be here when I leave. 
This camp means so much to me,” Blustein said.STUDENT LIFE

Maria B. Grant, M.D., a professor of pharmacology and therapeutics at UF’s College of Medi -
cine, has researched a way for stem cells to help repair damaged retinas.

EXPERIMENTED WITH MICE.

The link between age and vision loss 
may be a thing of the past.
New UF research suggests that bone 
marrow stem cells can be programmed 
to repair damaged retinas in people 
with macular degeneration, which causes worsened vision with age.
According to Maria Grant, senior 
researcher for the project, the research-ers experimented on mice and injected 
adult bone marrow stem cells into the 
rodents’ circulatory systems after modi-
fying them to act like retinal cells.
“It’s a unique way to program cells,” 
Grant said.  “UF’s the first to do it in 
this way.”
The new procedure will target dis-
eases like macular degeneration, the damage to a critical area of the retina, 
and cardiovascular disorders, such as 
atherosclerosis and coronary artery dis-ease.
Macular degeneration affects almost two million people in the United States, making it the most common cause of vi-sion loss in the country. 
“Macular degeneration usually 
causes blindness,” Grant said. “[This research] will someday restore vision.”
Grant said she thinks the same effect 
could be created by injecting drugs into the cells instead of modifying them in a culture.
The researchers found that they 
could activate the stem cells by mim-
icking the body’s natu-
ral signaling channels 
with chemicals, using 
drug manipulation 
rather than genetic manipulation, Grant 
explained.
Twenty-eight days after receiving 
the modified stem cells, the mice with damaged retinas showed no differences 
from the normal mice. This suggests the 
same thing would happen in humans because mice are used as a common model for human disease, Grant said.
Grant and UF have a pending patent 
on their research, which was developed over about four years, and they hope 
to start clinical trials for the procedure 
within the next year, Grant said.New stem cell procedure could reduce vision loss

International cancer experts have moved tanning beds and other sourc-
es of ultraviolet radiation into the top cancer risk category, deeming them as deadly as arsenic and mustard gas. The research was pub -
lished online in the medical journal Lancet Oncology last week by ex-perts at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon.
� SHOW WILL FEATURE 50 PIECES.
A $15,000 grant from the French-American 
Fund for Contemporary Art will help the 
Harn Museum of Art commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall in an exhibit set to debut in February.
The fund awarded the Harn Museum the grant for its “Project Europa: Imagining the (Im)Possible” exhibit.
The show will depict the tie between art and 
politics and the promise of a “New Europe” in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall, said Kerry Oliver-Smith, the museum’s cura-tor of contemporary art.
The exhibit will feature 50 pieces, including 
video, photography, sculpture and wall paint-ings from 20 artists around the world.
The fund awards 14 grants each year to 
museums promoting French and American culture, said Tami Wroath, Harn director of public relations and marketing.
Smith said she hopes the exhibit will be 
a catalyst for discussion about American de-mocracy and the similarities between Ameri-can history and the history of the wall.
“In terms of unification and democracy, 
artists have really responded,” Smith said. “Their work hits on both politics and poetry.”
The exhibit will also be funded by an Andy 
Warhol Foundation grant, the C. Frederick and Aase B. Thompson Foundation and sev-eral UF organizations.

Marla McGill had a lot of plans when she graduated 
from UF, but getting skin cancer wasn’t on her list.
The Jacksonville native said she loved the sunshine 
and went to the tanning salon only a handful of times when she had free passes, but when a small mole on her stomach began to change colors last October, she knew something was wrong.
A biopsy confirmed her fears — McGill was diag-
nosed with the early stages of skin cancer at age 23 — and the cancer was safely removed.
She was one of more than 25 million Americans 
who participate in the activity that was announced 
Wednesday to be carcinogenic — the highest category 
of cancer risk.
According to the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organi-zation, the risk of skin cancer increases by 75 percent if the person uses a tanning bed before the age of 30. 
Based on older research, scientists could only clas-
sify tanning beds as possibly harmful, but after analyz-ing about 20 different studies, researchers determined 
that tanning beds pose far greater a risk than they pre-
viously thought.
The research puts tanning beds and other sources 
of ultraviolet radiation in the same lethal group as tobacco, chimney sweeping and the hepatitis B virus. International cancer experts also recently deemed tan-ning beds to be as dangerous as arsenic gas, according to an article on MSNBC.com.
As of Monday, nearly 35 percent of the 1,755 people 
who responded to an MSNBC.com poll indicated that they had never used a tanning bed, and commenters called them “cancer beds” that “should be illegal.”
But as the use of tanning beds has increased among 
people under the age of 30, doctors have also seen a rise in the number of young people with skin cancer, according to the article.
“The question is how students will react to this 
study. Or even if they will react,” said Mel Toran, ex-
ecutive director for North Central Florida’s American 
Cancer Society. “Our hope is that people will finally recognize the danger that tanning beds present and take caution.”Toran insists that there are no advantages to using 
tanning beds, especially given the new research.
“The bottom line is simple,” he said. “If the risk is 
skin cancer, there is no benefit.” 
More than one million cases of skin cancer, the most 
common type of cancer, are diagnosed in the United States each year, according to the American Cancer So-ciety Web site, and the number of melanoma cases has risen steadily in the last few years. 
Taylor Tribou, a UF political science junior, said the 
free tanning offered by many companies and apart-ment complexes make tanning convenient for young people.
Tribou lived at Royal Village Apartments, a com-
plex that offered a free tanning bed to its residents.
She said that her decision to live at Royal Village 
wasn’t based on the free tanning, but it was a pleasant 
perk.
“I have fair skin, so I would have had to pay for 
a tanning membership somewhere else anyway,” she 
said. “I saved money by signing my lease there. I think it was a smart idea on their part to attract more resi-dents.”
Tribou estimated that she used the tanning bed at 
her apartment about 30 times during the year and said she plans to continue moderate use.
“I don’t go every day, so I’m not a tan-a-holic or 
anything,” she said. “I just feel more confident when I’m tan. I don’t see what the big deal is.”
But McGill said her tanning bed days are over.She said she regrets going to the tanning salon and 
not wearing enough sunscreen when she went out-doors, and she wishes she had listened to her parents’ warnings to be safe while in the sun.
“The urge to always be tan is such a vanity thing,” 
she said. “If there’s one thing I learned from my expe-rience, it’s that my health is more important than the color of my skin.”Study: Tanning beds could be as harmful as arsenic
“The question is how students will react 
to this study. Or even if they will react.”

22% NOToday’s question: Does UF have the right to ban smoking on campus?Monday’s question: Did ex. Cpl. Bill Billings receive a puny punishment?U.S. culture defies environmentalism
Ashes to Ashes
Campus ban removes 
smokers’ rights
Column
Incomplete Sentence
The man charged with 
25 counts of battery last April has gotten his 
comeuppance.
Robin Garb, the 22-year-
old UF student better known as the Gainesville Groper, is going to plead no-contest on Friday to assaulting female students on campus. Garb took certain “liberties” with the women after claiming he was trying to remove a bug off their clothing. We are glad 
that he is going to be removed 
from society, but we feel like the crimes don’t constitute the prison and probation time he is slated to receive. 
The news of his sentence 
might not seem so jarring if it didn’t come so soon after the sentencing of ex-Cpl. Bill 
Billings, who received a mere 
24-month probation for as-saulting prostitutes on the job. One might make the argu-ment that since the women were prostitutes, they had a choice in the matter.
But remember that some of 
the women (excuse us, girls) 
Billings “employed” were as 
young as 13 (and therefore clearly doing it out of some horrible, terrible necessity).
So, excuse us while we 
get this straight: An officer of the law gets off basically un-scathed for getting up close and personal with women 
while on the city’s dollar, but 
when regular Joe Pervert gets caught inappropriately touch-ing women (on his own time and dime), he gets hard jail time? Sounds like an inconsis-tency to us.
We aren’t downplaying 
the seriousness of Garb’s 
crime (or saying his victims 
don’t deserve justice) but are pointing out the law’s obvi-ous sympathy for its own kin.As if university students who smoke didn’t have enough to worry about already, UF will ban cigarette smoking on campus beginning in July 2010. Healthy Gators is 
quick to point out that only 9 percent of UF students smoke. But just because someone is in the minority doesn’t mean their rights 
should be taken away. Last we checked, this was America.
Some students are addicted to cigarettes and just need to 
smoke. It might not be you, and it might not be 91 percent of 
your friends, but that demographic exists. And on campus, after a stressful exam or in the midst of a class-filled Monday, cam-pus might be the only place students can get some of the much needed stress reduction.
And for those who raise the argument that they shouldn’t 
have to be exposed to second-hand smoke: Who are you kid-
ding? As though entering a sanitized bubble for three hours a 
day like John Travolta in “The Boy in the Plastic Bubble” is go-ing to make up for the smoke-filled porches and drunk-filled downtown streets where you spend your weekends?
The stress that the ban will cause those who rely on cigarettes 
to cool down will no doubt trump the stress that it would cause non-smokers to consciously avoid stepping into a smoker’s face. Although UF won’t write tickets to smokers, the stigma the ban puts on smokers is unacceptable.
Because the majority of UF students don’t smoke, smokers 
are already going to be a little reticent to light up. And when they do, they probably won’t  blow smoke in someone’s face. If someone can’t handle being exposed to smoke that has dissipat-ed into open air, they probably shouldn’t go outside anyway.
UF isn’t a high school. The students, faculty and staff of UF 
are all (or at least the vast majority) able to obtain tobacco prod-ucts legally. And those that do (and inevitably will, whether there is a “ban” on smoking) are already killing their health. 
They don’t need their dignity or their rights killed every time 
they step on campus.
Glee for green has been a long time coming in this country. What started out as an almost under-ground burlap sack movement has sprung into a 
multibillion-dollar enterprise and an entire culture, even generation, of planet-conscientious actions. 
We drive Priuses and are quick to let others know that 
we are doing our part to save the planet. We are quick to tote our planet-friendly bags in supermarkets and are even quicker to act as the perfect start of a doom-and-gloom en-vironmental lecture masquerading as a conversation while perusing the aisles farthest away from the meat section. 
Admittedly, most of us do not fit into this stereotypi-
cal yippie hippie eco-flower power mold, but we all know someone who does. And while we may secretly poke fun 
at these people who, yes, single-handedly save the world 
by abstaining from eating meat, their planet-saving enthu-siasm has rubbed off on many of us. 
Switching out a typical light bulb to the new and im-
proved efficient incandescent bulbs gives many a short thrill. Using ‘green’ deodorant not only leaves us smelling au natural but potently lets others know about our desire to save the planet as well. 
While it may be shocking to consider, many people sim-
ply aren’t ready to ditch their real deodorant and trade in the ole’ Tahoe for a Fiat 500, a smart car competitor that Fiat-controlled Chrysler may import stateside soon. 
Jonathan Goodman may be one of the green movement’s 
shining angels. After years of mechanic work, Goodman figured out a way to create an automotive engine that can easily run on alternative fuels and boost mileage near 100 miles per gallon. But Goodman’s engines never make it into flimsy organic pieces of pasta that pass as a car. Instead, 
he plops them into heavy Hummers and Chevy Suburbans. 
And the engines that he creates aren’t delicate or made of tea leaves either. Instead, they’re jet-propelled, doubling and even tripling not just the miles per gallon the engine can run off of but the horsepower as well. The environmental movement 
could learn a few things from busi-nessmen like Goodman. We Ameri-cans are not pansies, after all. While some may be more willing and open 
to the idea of changing their lifestyle 
to one that promotes driving hybrid vehicles and shopping sustainably, many simply aren’t ready yet. 
In our country, Discovery Chan-
nel dedicates a whole week of programming alone to in-spired footage of gory shark attacks. We send mentally retarded people to death row. We lock up 10,000 children each year in adult correction facilities. We gloat over our 
huge military. Surely, not many people are going to suc-
cumb to driving hybrids when we can conquer the urban jungles in our fake Hummers. 
The problem with environmentalism isn’t its lack of pas-
sion, but who’s passionate about the cause itself. The cause is still too lefty, too New England Liberal and way too Hol-lywood.
The environmental movement has had much success 
recently in the battle for changing our cultural philosophy. 
Hybrid car sales are up, as well as sales of other low emis-
sion cars. Large companies now boast about how green they are, and daytime talk shows devote airtime to explain-ing how being green around home can save money. 
But what happens when the money comes back? What 
happens when the economy turns the corner? What hap-pens if gasoline manages to stay below the $3.50 mark year-round? Will we see another tidal mass of petite blond wom-en straining to see over the steering wheel of their GMC 
Yukons?
Unless someone like Jonathan Goodman tinkered with 
their suburban tanks to achieve a higher mpg rating, I sure 
hope not.

Progressive taxation not something to fear
Johnathan Lott’s July 30th column is either delib-
erately misleading or laughably misinformed, possi-
bly both. He implies that if marginal tax rates go up, the government will take “56 percent of every dol-lar” that a wealthy person earns. Is UF’s economics 
department really so bad that an economics junior 
doesn’t understand marginal tax rates? Honestly?
A taxpayer in the highest income bracket would 
pay that bracket’s percentage only for income within the bracket. For example, in 2009, a married per-son filing separately paid 35 percent for each dollar earned more than $186,475. That is, a person making $200,000 was taxed at 35 percent for $13,525 of his or her income and at lower percentages for the rest. His 
or her effective tax rate is around 26 percent.
Lott states that “everybody should pay his or her 
fair share in taxes,” and he’s absolutely correct.
What he conveniently forgets to mention is how 
much more the wealthy receive from the govern-
ment. Look at defense. Like insurance, defense is worth more when you have more to defend. Look at Troubled Asset Relief Program. With the news of the continuing executive bonuses, those billions aren’t 
exactly helping everyday Americans. When Warren 
Buffett — who, by the way, said he pays a tax rate of 18 percent — argues that the super-rich should pay more in taxes, you should probably listen.
An overwhelming majority of American econo-mists, something like 80 percent, favor progressive taxation. Adam Smith, in “The Wealth of Nations,” wrote in support of it. Lott’s arguments against it are 
grossly misinformed and without merit.

NPR a positive development for local radio
The decision for WUFT-FM to drop its classical 
music selections and pick up new NPR program-
ming is an extremely positive development. Al-though considered old-fashioned by some, radio is one of the most nimble media sources around.
It is suited for quick headlines as well as more in-
depth analyses. When I majored in music, I learned that the best resource for classical music is record-ings, concerts and creating the music ourselves. If we want to help keep traditions alive, the best way to do that is to support those that make and analyze classi-cal music here on our own campus. Extended broad-casts work well for top 40 hits but do little justice to more than a thousand years of Western tradition.
For the fans of the rather mild mix associated with 
classical radio, there’s still the HD channel. I’d rather have better sound for Bach and Beethoven than for Diane Rehm, anyway. But for those of us that do pre-fer NPR, we have a lot to look forward to.

5LSContractor tied to deathsGuest column
KBR, the former Halliburton sub-sidiary that’s now the Army’s largest contractor, is a threat to 
the safety of our servicemen and ser-vicewomen.
The latest evidence of this comes in 
the form of a report from the Depart-ment of Defense’s inspector general released Monday that directly linked KBR with the death of Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Maseth in January 2008.
Maseth was electrocuted while 
showering in a U.S. base in Iraq. The report said that KBR didn’t ground 
equipment at the base during instal-
lation, including the water pump that short-circuited and killed Maseth, and failed to report improperly grounded equipment found on routine inspec-tions. The report goes on to say that KBR, along with another contractor, “performed electrical repairs that per-petuated electrical hazards” and fell 
short of the “skillful and workmanlike 
manner” called for in KBR’s contract.
KBR, predictably, continues to 
deny it had anything to do with Maseth’s death. The company is also on the receiving end of several law-suits from servicemen and service-women who were exposed to toxic fumes while working near or around 
KBR-operated, open-air burn pits.
According to an article in the July 
13 issue of Newsweek, KBR was con-
tracted to provide waste-disposal services for several U.S. bases in Iraq and Afghanistan. The company used these burn pits to incinerate things like medical waste, batteries and artillery, allowing carcinogens to permeate the 
air. One plaintiff reports having kid-
ney disease, chronic bronchitis and a skin condition after being exposed to the fumes from one such burn pit. Similarly, CNN reported that other service members said they have severe chest pain, asthma, severe migraines and breathing problems.
KBR denies that it acted improper-
ly, saying that their burn pits are oper-ated as specified by Army guidelines — even as a KBR employee who op-erated a burn pit said he received no guidelines at all as to what he could and could not burn.
In a separate set of lawsuits filed 
against the company, dozens of Na-tional Guard soldiers allege KBR knew that an Iraqi water treat-ment plant was contaminated 
with the potentially deadly chemical 
hexavalent chromium and failed to 
tell them. The soldiers were assigned to protect KBR employees rebuilding the plant in 2003 and subsequently ex-perienced serious health problems.
In an interview with West Virginia 
Public Broadcasting, one of the plain-tiffs, Russell Powell, head paramedic of the West Virginia National Guard’s 
1092nd Engineering Battalion, said 
soldiers in his battalion began hav-ing nose bleeds, rashes and breathing problems shortly after arriving at the plant. Powell said that KBR officials blew off their concerns, dismissing the illnesses as the result of dry air.
Other soldiers assigned to protect 
the same water treatment plant expe-
rienced similar symptoms that persist-
ed after returning home. For some sol-diers, their symptoms went from bad to worse: one soldier developed lung cancer, and another died of lung dis-ease. The lawsuits are still pending.
There are certainly several larger 
conversations that can be drawn from these incidents: the lack of oversight 
of military contractors, the potentially 
destructive results of politicians hav-ing cozy relationships with big busi-ness and the relevance of Dwight Eisenhower’s warnings of a military-industrial complex run amok.
For now, the situation is simple: 
KBR is responsible for the death of a soldier and may be responsible for the 
illnesses and deaths of many more.
Those who put on the uniform to 
defend the values on which this coun-
try is based and to help those around the world offer their lives, their health and their well-being to do so. They deserve our warmest gratitude and deepest respect.
Instead, in the case of Ryan Maseth, 
KBR callously took him up on this of-fer by refusing to spend the resources necessary to prevent a death that was very preventable. It’s infuriating, and it’s unforgivable.
Our troops deserve much better 
than this — and, frankly, those culpa-ble at KBR deserve much worse.

Speaking Out“In Gainesville, the low price 
and reasonably strong environ-
mental ethic here motivates peo-ple to recycle more and throw 
away less,” Hawkins said. “Peo-
ple start thinking more about re-using, refilling, repairing and re-thinking, all the things that make 
less garbage.”
Because the price of trash 
disposal and pick-up increases 
with the amount residents throw away, they are motivated to re-
use, refill, repair and re-think 
their waste, she said.
One 20-gallon bag of trash 
picked up at curbside is $13.21, 35 gallons is $17.18, 64 gallons is 
$21.14 and 96 gallons is $26.42. 
According to Hawkins, there 
are more than 2,000 “pay-as-you-
throw” programs like these in the nation, but only two or three are in Florida, with Gainesville hav-ing one of them. Another incentive program 
that the plan discusses is a re-wards system for people who 
recycle. 
Already implemented in 
North Miami, a company called 
RecycleBank weighs each recy-
cling container before it is put on 
a truck and records the address. 
Companies sign up to have cou-pons sent to people who do a good job of recycling. 
Hawkins prefers the current 
system over coupon-based pro-grams.
She believes that if coupons 
go away, then less people will continue to recycle, but Gaines-ville’s program relies on making waste expensive, a more effective incentive, she said. 
“More communities and mu-
nicipalities will consider this,” she said. “In order to reach [the 
state’s] 75 percent goal, this will 
require communities to consider more innovative means of waste reduction.”Plan could reward recyclers8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 2009

Researchers have found that bacteria 
growing in the wood of sweet gum trees, 
also known as alligator wood, may improve the process of making biofuels.
The fuel would be developed from plant 
material often discarded as trash, said James 
Preston, project leader and professor in UF’s 
microbiology and cell science department.
Typically, the processes use genetically 
engineered bacteria or chemical reactions to break down compounds in plant cell walls 
to produce simple sugar molecules that can 
be fermented into fuel-grade alcohol, he said. The bacteria found in the sweet gum tree could help make the process more ef-ficient for cost-effective production of cellu-
losic ethanol.
 Cellulose is the tough support system of 
plant material found in different forms of waste like decaying wood.
One of the advantages, he said, is that 
plants are abundant, making cellulose plen-
tiful, as opposed to grains, which are neces-sary for food production.
 With the population growing, he said, 
food demand increases, leaving less grain left for ethanol production.
According to Gary Teter, associate pro-
fessor in the school of forest resources and 
conservation, one of the major contributing factors to greenhouse gas emissions is fossil fuels. 
But ethanol fuel does not add to the growth 
of greenhouse gases, he said, because it does 
not produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct.  Using ethanol fuel will also decrease the 
amount of petroleum used.
Mark Van Soestbergen, president of the Gainesville-based International Carbon 
Bank and Exchange, said being able to dis-solve trees into a useful fuel is a great thing. 
“If it can be done efficiently, we can grow 
forests strictly for fuel purposes and eventu-ally run carbon neutral,” he said.
According to Van Soestbergen, car en-
gines waste about 80 percent of the fuel, but only about 20 percent of ethanol is wasted, making it more efficient and less damaging to the environment.
According to Preston, the research is a 
step toward fixing the country’s waste of resources.
“We need to make a difference now in 
conserving our fossil fuels so we don’t run 
out,” Preston said.Professors find biofuel source from tree bacteria

� THE ADS ARE SCHEDULED TO AIR 
IN AUGUST.

 UF students taught Fox’s Sun Sports 
something new about their university — 
Gators do not wear “jorts.”
The network recently had UF advertis-
ing students develop a campaign including 
television commercials, billboards, radio and print ads for its “Breakfast with the 
Gators” program.
The ads are set to launch in August.
Out of about 100 students working on 
the campaign from a UF Copy and Visual-
ization class, the network executives chose 
eight students they believed had the stron-gest concepts to develop, according to a university press release.
The winning students were on set in Kis-simmee, Fla., for the production and were 
on hand to observe everything, right down 
to wardrobe decisions made by Sun Sports and the production company.
One commercial featured an actor wear-
ing jean shorts, more commonly referred to as “jorts” by students, something Gators are stereotyped as wearing to football games.
“I remember [one of my teammates] An-
drea saying ‘Oh my God, 
you have to change him 
now, or we are going to get made fun of,’” UF 
advertising senior Alli Schnur said. “That’s 
something they wouldn’t have known 
without us. I know the producers liked that because we brought the true Gator into the campaign.” 
To promote the network’s “Breakfast 
with the Gators” program, the students showed how breakfast and sports ﬁ  t to-gether. Their ﬁ  nal concept is named “Feed Your Growl.”“We were looking for something that 
will resonate with Gator fans across the state,” said Steve Liverani, vice president and general manager of Sun Sports and Fox Sports Florida. “The ‘Feed Your Growl’ 
concept does just that. It’s entertaining and 
memorable.”
In one commercial, a family of four rush-
es to make breakfast so they won’t miss the program. The other shows a man waking 
up to Florida’s band, the Pride of the Sun-
shine, in a room decked out in Gators gear. 
Schnur said combining the concepts was 
hard at ﬁ  rst because breakfast and sports 
don’t usually go together.
Hanna Palmer, a fourth-year advertis-
ing major, said the experience helped her 
put together a polished, professional port-folio.
“We were unsure of some things, but 
when we showed them [our ideas] they were really impressed with us,” Palmer said. UF students create Gator commercial By SIMON PERSICO

 The sound of traditional African drums 
boomed through ampliﬁ  ers in the Garden of 
Beginning as a haphazardly arranged parade 
of cars honked, crushing leaves underneath 
antique tires at a local Homowo festival Sat-urday.
Nearly 60 attended the festivities, pep-
pered with live music, West African foods, an antique car show and a sweet potato pie contest.
“[The festival] coincides with the coming 
of the harvest in Ghana,” said Femi Kako, an 
afrobeat musician, adding that the beginning 
of the African rainy season and end of famine are celebrated.
Coincidentally, rain fell on Gainesville’s 
Homowo festival, with showers beginning shortly after the winners of the festival’s sweet potato pie contest were announced.
In midst of the sun shower, a disk jock-
ey’s voice echoed, “These pies is missin’ hot 
sauce.”
The crowd was a cultural slurry, musi-
cians and their audience were clad in blue 
jeans and tops of woven adire, a West African indigo dyed cloth. The attendees included about 10 African immigrants, Kako said.
Though closer than Africa, some vendors, 
like Fritz T. Lewis, traveled from Orlando. At his stand, Lewis, a bookseller, offered hun-
dreds of books, which he said were all “items 
of interest to the black community.”
Standing next to a large gold-framed 
portrait of President Barack Obama, Lewis expressed his appreciation of the event. “It brings the community together,” he said.
Other vendors offered funnel cakes, chips, 
soda and candy, but along with these Ameri-can treats festival-goers dined on plates heap-
ing with traditional Nigerian cuisine.
For $6 dollars patrons were served light 
and ﬂ  uffy “jollof” rice, red from the tomato 
it was cooked with, chicken drumsticks, leafy callaloo, a spinach-like vegetable dish, and sweet golden brown plantains, fried and sprinkled with sprigs of bright green herbs. 
Attendees reported that the festival truly 
encapsulated their culture. 
“It shows you what our culture is all 
about, our day-to-day existence,” Kako said. “We are new arrivals, fresh arrivals, but African-American describes all of us.”As the antique car parade halted, Gedenimbo O. Atiba, a Yoruba Afrikan Priest spoke of the festival’s signiﬁ  cance.
“The African community is rising with 
their culture, customs and spirituality,” he 
said. “We are in a period of awakening.” AROUND GAINESVILLEFestival

 Aug. 6, 1969: Playboy has named UF the 
sexiest school in the country in its September 
issue, which hit mailboxes today.
UF tops a list of 25 schools rated “in 
descending order of permissiveness – the 
chart’s upper reaches being meccas for the 
sexually hedonistic, its lower depths monas-teries for the sexually meek.”
The article mentions UF’s freshmen 
women-only curfew, a rule which is lazily enforced, as one of the reasons the school 
ranked so high. 
“Although the tone of the article is 
sprightly,” according to the original Alliga-
tor article, “the research behind them was thorough enough to support a treatise in a sociological journal.” 
 Aug. 5, 1976: The establishment of UF’s 
ﬁ  rst organization for gays and lesbians, 
the Gay Community Service Center, is an-
nounced.
Five years earlier, a more radical group, the Gay Liberation Front, failed to achieve 
the same goal.
“The GLF is more politically radical,” 
said Elizabeth Williams, chairwoman for the 
center. “We have a broader base as to pur-pose and goals.”
The group pledges to work to eliminate 
prejudice, dispel myths and stereotypes, as well as help foster pride and self-awareness in the gay community. 
 Aug. 5, 1997: UF announces that students 
will now have access to a free university e-mail account, called GatorLink. 
Up until now students wishing to have 
a school account had to go through a third party server and pay a $20 fee.
Along with the e-mail service, students 
can register for classes free of charge on ISIS, the Integrated Student Information System. 
“The university wants UF faculty, staff 
and students to be able to communicate through e-mail,” said Fran McDonell, man-
ager of the UF Computing Help Desk. “Any-
where you have an Internet connection, you can access these services.” 10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 2009

Serving Gainesville since 1927
Healthy Gators, the ban aims to 
make UF students and employees healthier. She referenced a Healthy Gators report that says smokers miss more work and are less productive 
than non-smokers and spend less on 
health care.
Varnes said the policy will en-
courage smokers to quit, but UF isn’t telling people they can’t smoke. 
“What we’re saying is, ‘Not on 
our campus,’” she said.
According to the coalition’s re-
port, cigarette butts “are the single 
most common form of litter in the 
world.” On the UF campus, about 50,000 cigarette butts are tossed on the ground within 50 feet of build-ings each week, according to a study produced by Steve Pokorny, an as-sistant professor in UF’s department of health education and behavior. That translates to about 2.6 million 
butts a year, Pokorny said.
While tobacco and cigarette pa-
pers are biodegradable, the filters 
are not, according to the report.
“It’s definitely a critical health is-
sue, but it’s also a sustainability is-sue,” Varnes said.
UF is giving people plenty of no-
tice before the ban takes effect to give 
them time to quit, she said. UF will 
also offer free stop-smoking classes and free or discounted medications for students and employees, though it’s not clear yet if UF will have the money to increase the number of classes and medications available.
Students who smoke more than 
10 cigarettes a day are eligible for the Student Health Care Center’s QUIT program, while employees are eligible for another program of-fered through the center that allows spouses to enroll for a $100 fee.
UF also hopes that students and 
employees take advantage of other 
resources in the community and has 
provided a list at its new Web site, 
tobaccofree.health.ufl.edu.
Pokorny, the pro-
fessor who counted 
the number of discarded cigarette butts on campus, said he doesn’t think UF’s ban will be effective. 
“There has to be an enforcement 
component to change behavior,” he said.
Taking into account the smaller 
campus size, he said Santa Fe Col-lege has about half as many dis-carded butts within 50 feet of its buildings, even though more of its students smoke. 
Officers at Santa Fe can issue ci-
tations and have written 10 since April, according to the SFC police department. Cited students have to attend a two-hour educational workshop.
Other critics, like student Sen. 
Jonathan Ossip, say the ban attempts to regulate morality.“It seems like the university ad-
ministration is trying to make the campus into their perfect image,” he 
said.
Another student senator, Alan 
Yanuck, said if UF can ban tobacco 
on campus, it can also decide to ban alcohol. 
“It’s a dangerous precedent to 
set,” Yanuck said.
When asked if the Healthy Gators 
might recommend an alcohol ban, 
Varnes did not rule out the possibil-
ity but said the group would not fo-cus on alcohol in the coming year.
She said the tobacco ban is simi-
lar to many other UF rules. 
“We have all kinds of policies in 
place that regulate behavior on cam-pus,” she said.
Yanuck said he also took issue 
with the university’s decision to ban all tobacco instead of stopping at smoking.
Bill Properzio, director of UF’s 
Environmental Health and Safety Department, said although smoke-less products, like chewing tobacco, do not harm the health of others, they still cause cancer to the user 
and can be a nuisance to others.
“People that are chewing tobacco 
are spitting it out on the sidewalks,” 
he said. “It’s a sanitary issue.”
But if that’s the issue, Yanuck 
argued, why not extend the ban to gum?
“I see people spit gum out on 
campus all the time,” he said. Orlando: Officers won’t hand out tickets

Two national championships in three years has 
earned Urban Meyer a hefty raise.
Meyer signed a six-year, $24 million contract 
Monday to become the Southeastern Conference’s 
highest-paid coach in 2009.
Entering his fifth year in Gainesville, he has 
now become the third-highest-paid coach in the country behind USC’s Pete Carroll and Notre Dame’s Charlie Weis.
“Coach Meyer has certainly proven to be one 
of the top college football coaches in the country and should be compensated as such,” UF athlet-ics director Jeremy Foley said in a statement. “We 
are proud he is our coach, and we 
appreciate all that he has done for 
the Gators.”
Now, Meyer is contracted to be 
at UF until 2014, and the deal could be even sweeter for him depending on possible incentives. His previous 
contract paid him $3.25 million a year, but Meyer earned an additional $375,000 in bonuses in 2008.
As for any fans worrying about Meyer leaving 
UF, his new contract will retain the same $500,000 penalty he had in his old contract if he leaves ear-ly to go to any other school, according to ESPN.

A new contract had figured to be in motion 
since January when Meyer won his second na-
tional championship at UF.

Before the rain came down Friday 
night, The Swamp was flooded with 
Gators fans eager to see UF football 
players battle it out in the Gator Char-
ity Challenge.
An estimated 2,500 people attend-
ed the second annual strongman com-
petition in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium 
in which UF players competed in a three-part event to raise money for six Shands Hospital-affiliated charities: American Cancer Society, American 
Heart Association, Children’s Mira-
cle Network, March of Dimes, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the North Florida Affiliate of Susan G. Komen 
for the Cure.
The challenge was 
canceled before the 
final event due to 
inclement weather, 
but the team repre-
senting the Cystic Fi-brosis Foundation — featuring Tim Tebow 
and Brandon Spikes 
— came out on top. 
Six players — David Nelson, Cade 
Holliday, Joey Sorrentino, Lorenzo 
Edwards, Jermaine Cunningham and 
Dorian Munroe — were named cap-
tains, and they picked their 16-man squads.
With each team wearing matching 
shirts, the Gators went head-to-head in the tire flip, sled push and obstacle course.
 “It’s been a tough offseason camp, 
so I was a little worried about how the 
guys would come out here and how 
they would react to it,” said Nelson, who helped plan and promote the event. “But when they saw the fans 
out here, once the lights turned on 
and the competitive nature came out of them, they really enjoyed it.Charity work
marks end 
of offseason 
During UF’s run to a national title 
in 2006, David Nelson, a redshirt freshman, was one of several 
young receivers — including Percy Har-vin, Louis Murphy and Riley Cooper — learning from the likes of Dallas Baker and Andre Caldwell.
Now, Nelson has come full circle, and 
he will be partially responsible for the development of a young, inexperienced receiving corps, including true freshman Andre Debose and redshirt freshmen 
Frankie Hammond Jr., Omarius Hines 
and T.J. Lawrence.
“They’re constantly trying to learn, 
constantly trying to get better and learn from us, and that’s not stuff you see from young guys 
a lot,” Nelson said 
Friday. “They’re all competing, they all want to 
play and they all 
want to get on the field.”
The fact that 
UF will take the field this season without 
its top two receivers from 2008 has been 
somewhat overlooked. With the entire two-deep coming back on defense, Tim Tebow returning for his farewell tour and a few experienced players stepping up on the offensive line, people seem to think the Gators have no question marks 
on their depth chart.
Percy Harvin is gone. So is Louis 
Murphy. The player with the most re-
ceptions last year following those two 
was Aaron Hernandez, who will likely 
lead the team in catches this season. He’s a proven threat and he’s arguably Tebow’s most reliable target, but he only had 34 catches all of last year.
Nelson, a redshirt senior, is definitely 
the leader of the receiving corps. He has the necessary experience, although he

he does. He demands excellence of 
his players on the field and in the classroom,” Machen said in a state-ment released Monday. “Not only did the University of Florida win a national championship in January, but all 13 seniors earned degrees and the 2008 football team tied an 
SEC league record with 37 players 
named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll. We’re proud he’s a Gator.”While UF has faced strict bud-
get cuts on the academic side of things, it should be noted that the University Athletic Association re-ceives no money from the school to run the athletics program, and the 
UAA has contributed $17.3 million 
to the university since 2005.
Meyer has also done his part to 
put his name to good use. He has committed $1 million to the Flori-da Opportunity Scholars program, which helps out first-generation, financially disadvantaged stu-dents, and he is the co-chair of the program along with men’s basket-ball coach Billy Donovan.
“I continue to be very thankful 
and appreciative for everything 
the University of Florida and the 
athletic program has done for me and my family,” Meyer said in a statement. “Dr. Machen, Jeremy Foley and the community make this a special place and I’m hon-ored to be a part of it.”
“The charities got a lot out of it, and the people 
got a lot out of it.”
In addition to benefiting the charities and put-
ting on a unique show for the fans, the competition 
signaled the end of offseason workouts, as fall prac-tice begins Thursday morning. 
“We finished summer training on a great note 
and with lots of energy,” strength and conditioning 
coach Mickey Marotti said. “This is how we wanted 
to end our offseason program heading into the fall season.”
This offseason has been the toughest Nelson, a 
fifth-year senior, has experienced during his time in Gainesville, but the increased workload and inten-sity has kept the team from becoming complacent.
Nelson, a 6-foot-5 wide receiver, weighed in at 
195 pounds as a freshman. He has bulked up to around 218 pounds and said he should be at 220 by the first day of practice. 
“We’re never satisfied,” he said. “Every day, we 
come in and beat our previous best goals. Come in to the weight room, if we did 15 reps at the bench press, the next day we come in we’re going to beat 
that — we’re going to do 16, 17, 18.”
If the Gators’ display of strength 
Friday night is any indication, the 
offseason regimen has paid off.  Matt Patchan, who is moving back to the 
offensive line this season,  is “getting 
huge,” Nelson said, and many play-
ers appeared to be in better shape than last year.
“We’re continually building on what we did the 
last time we worked out, and everything we did was to keep that edge on our shoulder,” Nelson said. “We’re trying to keep that edge and make sure we don’t become complacent.”Coach commits $1 million to help disadvantaged

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — Lee Roy Selmon stands alone in personal ac-
complishments with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
First draft pick in team history. First to earn NFL defen-
sive player of the year honors. First (and only) player to have 
his jersey retired. All-time franchise sack leader. First to be 
elected to the Hall of Fame.
Twenty-five years after playing his last game, the soft-
spoken Selmon is adding another “first” to his list of achieve-
ments as the initial inductee into the Ring of Honor that will 
be established at Raymond James Stadium this season.
Selmon, who retired in 1985 after deciding against hav-
ing back surgery that might have extended his career, will be honored at haftime of the Nov. 8 home game against the 
Green Bay Packers.
The Bucs will wear throwback jerseys from the 1976 season 
— the franchise and Selmon’s first — and also recognize the 1979 Bucs, who Selmon led to Tampa Bay’s first-ever playoff berth and an appearance in the NFC championship game.
“It’s hard to believe it’s been 33 years. ... I’m so humbled 
that of all the players who are so deserving that they could 
have selected, they selected me to be their first inductee,” 
Selmon said Monday.
“I just want to say, it’s not about me. It just makes me think 
about all our players and coaches throughout the years that 
I had a great opportunity to play for and with, and our fans 
who came out and supported this franchise from day one.”
Clad in ghastly creamsicle-colored uniforms and helmets 
bearing a winking pirate logo, the Bucs went 0-14 in their in-augural season and lost the first 12 games of 1977. The 26-
game losing streak still stands as an NFL record.
The dubious start to the franchise, as well as Tampa Bay’s 
stretch of 12 consecutive seasons with double-digit losses 
from 1983 to 1994, was one of the reasons that current owners 
of the club resisted the idea of instituting a Ring of Honor.
When Malcolm Glazer purchased the club in 1995, he and 
his sons made a concerted effort to distance themselves from the past, including adopting new team colors and uniforms 
in 1997.
Seven playoff appearances, four division titles and one Su-
per Bowl championship later, the Glazers are ready to recon-nect with the franchise’s early days.
“It’s been a long time coming,” team co-chairman Bryan 
Glazer said. “Part of the reason we waited this long to do a Ring of Honor is now we have a number of players who can 
join (Selmon).”
Several players who’ve worn both the hideous Orange 
and today’s red and pewter, including former Bucs linebacker 
Derrick Brooks, pushed without success for the club to pay 
tribute to the franchise’s best from the 70’s and 80’s.
“I’m just excited about the team honoring the past and 
reaching back and bringing that part of the history back up front again,” said Selmon, whose 78.5 career sacks are still a 
franchise best.
“As far as the timing, I never really think those types of 
things. Again, it doesn’t even have to happen today. There’s no commitment, no obligation, no anything that says you have to do this as owners. I just appreciate the kindness of the 
organization that now is the time.”Bucs will debut 
Ring of Honor
hasn’t really been anything more 
than a third or fourth receiver un-less injuries forced the situation, 
he has been effective when put on 
the field, making two of the big-gest catches of the season.
“I’ve gone through a lot here. 
I’ve seen it all here,” he said. “I feel like I have a lot to relay to these guys and relay to the team, to the receivers.”
Nelson has come up big when 
needed, and Deonte Thompson seems to have the explosiveness and versatility UF needs. But can 
either of them take over as the No. 
1 receiver? 
Cooper’s future at UF is uncer-
tain, although all signs point to 
him signing a professional base-
ball contract but still playing his senior season. Nelson has been texting Cooper with his “recruit-ing spiel” in an attempt to get him 
to stay, and keeping the 6-foot-
3, 215-pound senior would be a huge help for Nelson.
“He’s one of those hard-nosed 
receivers you don’t see very of-ten,” Nelson said. “He brings a different element to this receiver group. He’s something that we 
need on this team, and we hope 
he decides to come back.”
If he leaves, Nelson and 
Thompson will be the Gators’ 
top two receivers. Of the receiv-
ers likely to see significant time on the field in 2009, only three are upperclassmen — Nelson, Cooper and Carl Moore.  
Back in 2006, Harvin was a 
freshman and gave the college football world its first glimpses of his versatility and electrifying 
playmaking ability. Now Debose 
is expected to fill the “Percy Posi-tion.” Although it’s already been written that fans should antici-
pate Debose to perform more like 
Harvin did as a freshman – not an NFL-ready junior — those expec-tations may still be too high, as 
Debose’s summer workouts have 
been hampered by a hamstring injury.
So maybe the receivers won’t 
be big-play threats like last year. 
And maybe they don’t have to be.
With the defense keeping op-
ponents off the board, the Gators 
may not even need more than a 
few touchdowns per game to re-
peat as national champions, and those points likely won’t be hard to come across with the other tal-
ent around Tebow. UF has the de-
pendable pass-catcher it needs in Hernandez and two speedy play-makers — Jeff Demps and Chris 
Rainey — out of the backfield. 
The receiving corps just needs 
to establish itself as enough of a 
threat to draw attention from de-fenders, giving the running backs 
room to utilize their home-run po-
tential. 
And with Nelson now the 
leader, the other wideouts need 
to mirror the development of UF’s 
young, inexperienced receivers from 2006.

 In 2007, Billy Donovan and the 
Gators stood on top of the college 
basketball world after back-to-back 
national championships. Now, Don-
ovan is looking to just get back into the NCAA Tournament.
After two straight National In-
vitation Tournament appearances, UF will attempt to rebound and join the ﬁ  eld of 65 without its best player from the last two seasons but with 
the addition of a 6-foot-10 transfer 
from Georgetown and a high-scor-ing freshman.
So the burning question for the 
men’s basketball team 
is: Can the Gators get 
back to the NCAA Tournament? 
There are plenty 
of other storylines to be found on this 
year’s team, and how each of those play out will determine whether or 
not UF makes it to the Big Dance.
Can Kenny Boynton ﬁ  ll the void 
in the backcourt left by Nick Ca-
lathes? Will Vernon Macklin live up to the hype and ﬁ  nally bring a 
much-needed physical presence to 
the Gators’ frontcourt? Does Dono-van need to get back to the tourna-ment to ensure his job security?
Donovan made the ﬁ  rst step to-ward turning his program around by upping the difﬁ  culty of his non-
conference schedule, slating oppo-
nents like Michigan State and Xavier. There is little doubt he did so think-ing of the effect a quality win against those teams could have on UF’s 2010 NCAA Tournament résumé. 
For those games to have any 
impact in March, the Gators will have to improve their Southeast-ern Conference record. They went 9-7 in 2008-09 against a struggling SEC that put just three teams in the 
tournament. But the conference has 
improved, particularly with the im-pressive offseason Kentucky had.
Last year, UF struggled to ﬁ  nd its identity all season, a problem it can’t afford to face again. Even without 
Calathes, however, the Gators could 
be better prepared to do so. 
Erving Walker, the only true 
point guard on the roster, will be-come the team’s primary ball han-
dler. Boynton is a shoo-in to play the 
other guard spot and put points on the board. Macklin is supposedly the big man UF has lacked since Al 
Horford and Joakim Noah left, and 
his arrival allows Alex Tyus to move over to power forward. A few play-ers could ﬁ  ll the small forward spot — namely Chandler Parsons and 
Dan Werner.
In addition to having a more tra-
ditional lineup, the Gators will also 
enjoy some level of depth in the 
frontcourt if they remain injury-free, 
unlike the past two years.
However, most of the team’s po-
tential is dependant upon Boynton and Macklin living up to the hype. 
As a true freshman, Boynton will 
have to make the adjustment to the college game. Macklin, a junior, will be back on the court for the ﬁ  rst time 
since the 2007-08 season.
If Boynton can at least match 
Calathes’ scoring, Macklin can keep 
opposing big men from dominating the Gators down low and the Gators 
can rectify their struggles with in-
consistency from the last two years, Donovan could lead his team back to the NCAA Tournament. 20, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 2009

 The 2009 UF baseball team exceeded expecta-
tions before a disappointing end to the season.
In 2010, the job will only get more difﬁ  cult. Ex-
pectations will be higher, and the Gators will not 
sneak up on anyone.
So the question is: Will UF get back over the 
hump and make it back to the College World Se-ries?
Some fans may have purchased their ﬂ  ights 
to Omaha this year after UF swept through its NCAA regional at home, 
including two wins over longtime ri-
val Miami.
It was the ﬁ  rst time ever (in 11 
tries) that the Gators advanced out 
of a regional that included the ‘Canes, and with the super regional being played in Gainesville, it looked like No. 8 national seed UF would make its ﬁ  rst CWS appearance since 2005.
Then a funny thing happened. Southern Miss, 
seeded third in its regional, continued its Cinder-ella run, came to McKethan Stadium and swept the super regional.
It was an unsatisfying end for the Gators, but the 
year as a whole exceeded outside expectations for a program ranked in only a handful of preseason polls. 
UF won its ﬁ  rst Southeastern Conference Eastern 
Division title since 2005.
While falling just shy of Omaha, coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan did remind Gainesville of postseason success. After going 0-4 in the 2008 postseason, UF won one game in the SEC Tournament this year and 
swept its NCAA regional. There will be plenty of turnover heading in 2010, 
however.
The Gators will lose ﬁ  ve key seniors (Avery 
Barnes, Teddy Foster, Stephen Locke, Brandon McArthur and Patrick Keating) as well as four un-
derclassmen who have already signed MLB con-tracts (Billy Bullock, Tony Davis, Buddy Munroe and Mike Mooney). 
They also could stand to lose three others — 
Matt den Dekker (Pirates, 16th round), Riley Coo-per (Rangers, 25th) and Kevin Chapman (White Sox, 50th) — who were selected in the MLB Draft but have not yet signed pro contracts.
The inﬁ  eld will be anchored by First-Team All-
SEC second baseman Josh Adams and National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association Freshman Hitter of the Year Preston Tucker at ﬁ  rst but with-out returning starters at shortstop, third base and 
catcher.
The outﬁ  eld will see a mix-up with a new starter 
needed in left after Barnes’ departure, and center 
ﬁ  eld is up in the air depending on whether or not 
den Dekker decides to go pro. 
Right ﬁ  eld will likely continue to be split be-
tween the Pigott brothers, rising senior Jonathan 
and rising sophomore Daniel.
The pitching staff may again be a mix-and-match 
game, although O’Sullivan used his arms quite suc-cessfully in 2009. 
Returning pitchers include the two wins leader 
from this year — rising freshmen Anthony DeS-
clafani and Alex Panteliodis with six each — and 
strikeout leader Nick Maronde, also a rising sopho-more.
So there will be plenty of questions coming into 
2010, but after 2009’s surprise success, the question will be whether the baseball team can keep the good times rolling. 
Can Donovan lead the Gators back to the NCAA Tournament?
