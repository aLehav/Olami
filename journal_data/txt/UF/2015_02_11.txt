Prospective Inﬁ  nity Hall res-
idents accessorized with blue 
construction hats got a sneak 
peek of UF’s newest housing fa-
cility Tuesday.
Although Inﬁ  nity Hall is 
still under construction, UF’s 
Housing and Residence Educa-
tion staff started leading tours, which will continue until its opening in Fall, to give students an idea of their future living ac-
commodations.
“During the tour, students 
will be able to see rooms, get a 
sense for the academic partner-
ships throughout the building 
and will even be able to select their room for next year,” said Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate vice president for Stu-
dent Affairs.
Quinton Reddick, 19, said he 
was able to see where different amenities would be, including the 3-D printing lab.
“It’s going to be nice to have 
these resources right downstairs 
and students with the same in-terests, goals and drive,” the UF 
computer science sophomore 
said. “I’ll deﬁ  nitely live there at least next Fall.”
Inﬁ  nity Hall is focused on 
housing Innovation Academy students, as administration 
believes the resources are ﬁ  t 
for the program, Blansett said. However, it is open to all UF undergraduate students.
The housing contracts avail-
able this week are geared to-ward Innovation Academy, she said. Next week, all prospective residents can complete the pro-
cess online.Infinity Hall begins holding tours for future residents

Lucky’s Market has brought new life to 
what was once a nearly vacant plaza.
Verde Plaza, located at the corner of 
Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 23rd 
Avenue, has been transformed into a thriv-ing shopping center and is now ﬁ  lled with new customers.
Dan Anson, 40, owner and chief operat-
ing ofﬁ  cer of Planet Fitness, said about ﬁ  ve years ago a lot of businesses were leaving the area and relocating to Archer Road.
“I hate to throw around the word blight, 
but it was pretty close to that description,” said Anson. “Lucky’s has certainly had an impact on the plaza.” 
Jean S. Cortes, tax specialist & seasonal 
ofﬁ  ce manager for H&R Block in the shop-ping center, said prior to Lucky’s opening, the plaza was almost vacant.
Lucky’s has brought attention to neigh-
boring businesses, Anson said, estimating that the plaza is about 90 percent full now.
“If somebody from maybe outside of our 
approximate trade area has come across 
town to go to Lucky’s, it leads them to some 
of the other businesses here in the plaza,”  he said.
Cortes has noticed many types of clien-
tele in the shopping center since the open-ing of Lucky’s Market.
“Our numbers are up, and year over 
year we are doing better and pacing faster,” Cortes said.
However, the lack of available parking 
has caused problems for the other busi-nesses.
“The volume of the trafﬁ  c makes it so 
that there are really no places to park,” Cor-tes said.
This lack of available parking also brings 
up safety concerns for her and other Verde

A heavy silence fell over the Senate 
chambers at Tuesday night’s UF Student 
Senate meeting when Sen. Michael Christ 
announced the formation of an indepen-
dent Senate coalition.Sen. Christ said he will be leading the 
coalition of 21 members, made up of 18 former Swamp Party senators and three 
independent senators.  
“A lot of my colleagues in the chamber 
talk about how the Senate is supposed to 
be a nonpartisan place, a place where par-ties leave us where we come in here and 
just work for 100 percent of the students,” 
he said. “That’s what I’m hoping to do 
with this coalition.”
There are currently 87 UF student sena-
tors, 21 of which are now independent. 
With 18 members ending their afﬁ  liation, that makes almost a quarter of Senate in-dependent ahead of elections.  
Some senators, such as Sen. Stephanie 
Wong, Sen. Dwayne Fletcher and Sen. Yareliz Mendez-Zamora, verbally an-nounced their party disafﬁ  liation to sena-tors during public debate.

of certain decisions Swamp made, par-18 Senate members drop party affiliation Tuesday

UF is highly ranked for its sports, academ-
ics, research and now for its  electronic dance 
music scene.
UF is currently ranked as the No. 3 best 
college EDM scene in the country, according to an ongoing, online Ranker contest, which began Feb. 3.
Ranker, one of the world’s largest databas-
es for online surveys and polls, and Magnetic Magazine, an EDM magazine, are working together to uncover the college with the best EDM scene.
Yves Bergquist, Ranker senior director of 
business development, said the idea stemmed from a similar poll searching for the “Best EDM DJ,” which generated about 10,000 votes.
“(The college EDM scene) was an angle that 
really hasn’t been covered before,” Bergquist said. “We thought college and university stu-dents would get really excited about it, there’s definitely a lot of passion, and we just wanted 
to put it out there and have fun with it.”
Voters can click the blue thumbs up or red 
thumbs down for any school, as well as add 
another to the list.
Voting for round 1 will close March 2 at 9 
p.m., eliminating all but 30 schools. The sec-ond and final stage of voting will open March 3, and the winner will be revealed the last week in March during Miami Music Week. 
Results will be published in both Ranker and 
Magnetic Magazine.As of press time, Bergquist said there have 
been about 1,000 votes since the poll launched.
Out of more than 100 schools, UF is cur-
rently third on the list behind Florida State 
University and the University of Southern 
California.
Amanda Guillen, a 22-year-old UF journal-
ism senior, said she attends about six EDM shows a year.
After experiencing FSU’s EDM scene as a 
student freshman year, Guillen said she’s not positive UF can push ahead in the polls. But UF is a good hub for music. Third about sums it up, she said.
“There’s a loyal following here,” Guillen 
said.Ongoing college EDM culture

 IT HELPS FARMERS IN NORTH 
FLORIDA.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer jmcpherson@alligator.org
UF is reaching out to Florida’s agricultural 
roots.
The school’s Institute of Food and Agri-
culture Sciences has developed a program 
called Agriculture Saves, or AgSave$, which is designed to help farmers in North Florida 
with both financial and educational decision-
making.
“Farming is a business which has evolved 
into more than just a way of life,” said Ricki McWilliams, a family and consumer sciences specialist at the UF IFAS extension in Walton County, Florida, and one of the coordinators of the program.
The program will be introduced to the 
public Feb. 23 at a summit hosted by UF IFAS in a segment titled “Preparing and Planning for the Next Generation of Successful Farm-ers,” McWilliams said.
The free event will be held at three IFAS 
extension locations in North Florida — Mari-anna in Jackson County, Monticello in Jeffer-son County and Jay in Santa Rosa County. The deadline to apply is Feb. 19, McWilliams 
said.
Agriculture Saves will also hold a series of 
four workshops starting in late March at the 
15 IFAS extension locations that discuss top-ics ranging from planning for retirement and reducing debt to helping farmers secure their family and their farm’s future.
The cost for attending these four work-
shops is $55 per family, and the deadline to apply is March 10.
McWilliams said IFAS wants to ensure 
farmers have the skills needed to run their farms and prepare farm owners for the time when they need to pass their trade on to their children.
“We want to make sure they have the op-
portunity to be successful,” she said.
Justin Gearhart, a member of the UF Col-
lege of Agriculture and Life Science Lead-ership Institute, said he learned about the importance of agriculture and farming at a young age.
While the UF forest resource and conserva-
tion junior has not farmed himself, Gearhart, 20, said he became involved with the Future Farmers of America club in high school.
He said the experience opened his eyes be-
cause he was able to see firsthand where the food he eats every day comes from.
“I got to meet people whose lives were 
solely based on agriculture,” Gearhart said. “I just came to respect what they did.”
McWilliams said the program provides a 
safety net to ensure farming in the U.S. is able 
to remain a possibility.
“Farming is important for everyone even if 
they don’t know it,” she said. “Without farm-
ing, there wouldn’t be food.”New IFAS program aims to help farmers secure their futures

Sen. Yareliz Mendez-Zamora (left), representing District C, announces her disaffiliation from Swamp Party. “There are things that can no longer be ignored in these Senate chambers,” she said.
Those who disaffiliated expressed concerns over Swamp decisions
ticularly one made at last week’s Senate meeting when the Senate approved Austin Sherman as an election commissioner.
She, along with other senators, 
expressed concerns when Sher-man, a former Swamp majority leader, was nominated to serve as an election commissioner. The election commission hears elec-tion complaints
Several senators, including 
Sen. Mendez-Zamora, spoke to Senate about their reasons for leaving the party. Sen. Mendez-Zamora said she was unhappy with how her party was handling Senate issues.
“There are things that can no 
longer be ignored in these Senate chambers,” she said, “and I be-lieve that by changing my affilia-tion to the independent coalition, I can truly represent 100 percent of the Student Body.” 
Sen. Preston Jones said he sup-
ports the new coalition and said he is looking forward to working 
with the group.
“I believe the current system 
fails to accurately represent all 
students’ interests and all stu-
dents’ needs,” he said.
UF Student Senate President 
Joseph Michaels said he supports the senators’  decisions to change their party affiliations.  
“Senators are encouraged to 
do what they think is best for their constituents,” he said, “and I look forward to working with all senators to ensure the Senate functions effectively.” 
Four student bills allocating  
$7,561.50 were also passed dur-ing the meeting.  
Funding for Sparks Magazine 
was approved for $1,700; May-ors Council was approved for $4,002.50; Arab Students’ Asso-
ciation was approved for $660 
and Latino/Hispanic Organiza-
tion for Graduate Students was 
approved for $1,199.SENATE , from page 1Other plaza businesses

“We make sure that we walk 
to our cars in teams because we are leaving at 9 or 10 o’clock at night and cannot park in prox-imity to the storefront,” Cortes 
said.  “I want to make sure that 
my team is safe.”
She put up a list of Gainesville 
Police’s nonemergency telephone numbers if employees ever need 
assistance.
However, Cortes added, 
“They are wonderful neighbors, 
and they have brought vibrancy 
to the plaza. I applaud, I welcome 
them, and I wish them success.”Betsy Whitaker, president of 
Asset Management, has been the property manager of Verde Plaza for almost 20 years and has seen 
the amount of patrons fluctuate 
over time.
Whitaker said the mixture of 
individuals going to Planet Fit-
ness for the New Year and the 
Lucky’s Market grand opening 
has filled up the parking lot, but 
she said there is parking in the back of the plaza.
“I think in the short term it 
may be frustrating for consumers to get their parking space,” An-son said, “but in the long term I 
believe everyone is going to ben-
efit from Lucky’s Market being here.”LUCKY’S , from page 1ALYSSA FISHER

Chris Abeleda woke up around lunchtime 
Tuesday to news that he was being released from the hospital.
Before he left, he played “Like I’m Gonna 
Lose You” by Meghan Trainor and John Legend, leaving some of the nurses in tears. 
And at about 3 p.m., Abeleda — diagnosed 
with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia as a fresh-man — was lying comfortably in the room his family rented in Wildflower Apartments.
After finding out his brother was a perfect 
bone marrow match and undergoing a trans-
plant 19 days ago, Abeleda’s white blood cell 
count rose to 812, exceeding the 500 needed to get leave the hospital.
The standard hospital time after this proce-
dure is usually 28 to 30 days, said Mara Abeleda, his 25-year-old sister and a UF alumna.
“To get that news so early —  it’s just over the 
top,” she said.
He has to wear a hospital mask outdoors and 
see the doctor every day to monitor his progress, 
but Abeleda, a 21-year-old psychology junior, 
said he’s ready get back to normal life.
The doctors are encouraging him to walk, 
even giving the OK to visit Paynes Prairie Pre-serve State Park. He’s going to play non-contact basketball in Wildflower’s court and hang out 
with friends.
Inspired by Abeleda, his fraternity — Pi Delta 
Psi — is hosting a bone marrow registry today on 
Turlington Plaza from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
A man of few words, he said he’s feeling great.

Deputies have now charged the ex-wife 
of Assistant U.S. Attorney Frank Williams 
with premeditated murder.
On Friday, police arrested Alexis 
Touchton-Williams, a Gainesville psychia-
trist, after she reportedly shot her ex-hus-
band in the arm at her home, according to an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office report.
At about 5 p.m., Williams arrived to 
pick up their daughter and drop off some paperwork when Touchton-Williams crouched and pointed a black semi-auto-matic gun at his chest. 
Williams told police he realized “she 
was going to kill me” and turned before getting shot in the arm.
Police originally charged Touchton-
Williams with aggravated battery after she spoke to police about the incident. Once authorities interviewed her ex-husband after his medical procedures, the charge was changed to attempted murder.When Williams told police the gun 
had been lying on a coffee table in the en-tranceway, deputies decided to switch the 
charges to premeditated murder.
“After we spoke to 
Mr. Williams, her charges were upgraded because the new charges were more fitting,” said ASO spokesman Art Forgey.
Touchton-Williams said she had placed it there earlier, accord-ing to the report.
Forgey said Williams remained in the 
hospital Monday with a non-life threaten-ing gunshot wound on his arm.
Touchton-Williams, 39, now faces a 
$750,000 bond. 
She had originally faced a $200,000 
bond and an aggravated battery with a deadly weapon charge.

mained in the Alachua County Jail.Ex-wife of US attorney now charged with premeditated murder

UF is about to look lovely in Lilly.
Several Lilly Pulitzer-themed events will be held today and 
Thursday, celebrating UF’s victory in the second annual Path to the Pink Palace contest.
The resort-wear brand’s contest opened in October, when 
students began voting for their university to win a visit from the Lilly Pulitzer Dream Job Team. During the last round, which had more than 100,000 votes, UF beat out Clemson University, the University of Alabama and Southern Methodist University, said Caroline Wright, social media associate at Lilly Pulitzer.  
Students can pose with a Lilly-printed Jeep that will be 
parked on Turlington Plaza from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. today.
“This is a brand new Jeep and this will be one of its first ap-
pearances,” Wright said.
The Dream Job Team, made up of the brand’s recruiters, will 
hold a presentation from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. in the Reitz Union Auditorium to discuss its history, inspiration for the collections and what each job within the company entails.
The last event today is a meet-and-greet party from 4 to 6 
p.m. at Pink Narcissus, at 3730 SW Archer Road, which is open to the public. There will be giveaways and an artist painting at the event, Wright said.
Wright said the main purpose of the trip is to recruit talent-
ed students who embody the Lilly personality. Interviews for future Lilly Pulitzer job opportunities will be held on campus Thursday. Students can sign up for interviews through the Ca-reer Resource Center.
Alison Ray, a 20-year-old UF accounting junior, said she 
might check out the events.

Initiative, to be known as GROW, will be a program de-
signed to help offices, labs and other facilities improve 
UF’s sustainability certification.
“It’s pretty much the units on campus that want guid-
ance or resources that can help their office become a little more sustainable,” said Allison Vitt, outreach and com-munications coordinator for the Office of Sustainability.
GROW is still in its beginning stages. It will look at 
areas within the workplace, such as energy use, water use, transportation and waste to create more sustainable practices, Vitt said.
She used the College of Journalism and Communica-
tions as an example, explaining it uses a lot of paper. Vitt said GROW can tailor its program to fit the needs of each workplace and help meet specific needs while remain-ing sustainable.
Another sustainability issue includes lab equipment 
that run continuously, like freezers and ventilation sys-tems because they require more energy use, Vitt said.
The UF Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology 
Research already has its own green team and reduces waste by recycling and using reusable plates. It is plan-ning to sign on to work with GROW, said Linda Green, the center’s associate director for emerging science.
“It’s all about progress,” Green said.
Vitt said there will be a GROW brainstorming session 
at noon on Feb. 18. The location is to be determined.IFAS to introduce new green programReader response

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgTuesday’s question: Do you have ideas 
for SG party platforms?Today’s question: Do you listen to EDM?Improvement in UF SG: a how-to guide
For those who missed out, last week I wrote a column 
detailing our Student Government representatives’ lack of visibility. In an attempt to highlight the dispari-
ties in SG presence during election time as compared to that of the rest of the year, I mentioned that Swamp Party has a recurring pattern of abandoning their social media plat-
forms after elections. Thankfully, Blake Murphy, SG director of external affairs, wrote a letter to the editor informing me of an election code that prohibits political parties from mak-ing posts outside of election cycles. Murphy also brought at-tention to another YouTube account, one of three unveriﬁ  ed ones, that releases “SG TV” episodes. He went on to mention that SG hosts dozens of events because visibility and trans-parency are their priorities. 
In short: Let’s get distracted by an election code and be 
proud of the level of visibility SG currently has.
Let’s pretend that the few hundred views “SG TV” epi-
sodes average is something to be proud of, and let’s pretend 
that Lunch on the Lawn doesn’t need to be announced more 
than two days in advance. Lastly, let’s hold up the facade that our SG is impeccable and has little room to improve.
Or we could be real. On the Alligator website, it says that 
more than 400 Facebook users recommended my column. 
The fact that there is a large portion of the Student Body that 
is dissatisﬁ  ed with SG is irrefutable. There is hope for us, however. Murphy said SG would love to hear any ideas we have, so here are some of mine.
First, get the YouTube ambiguity ﬁ  gured out. Three un-
veriﬁ  ed accounts posting SG material shows a level of in-competence that is appalling for a soon-to-be top-10 public institution. It complicates the challenge of keeping up with SG, and it does not coincide with the supposed SG priorities of visibility and transparency.
After that’s ﬁ  xed, SG should require senators to hold an 
ofﬁ  ce hour at least once a week. Murphy mentioned that sen-ators are required to table as per constituency. What he left out, and what former District D Swamp Party Senator Mela-
nie Garcia told me she was required to do as per the Chapter 324 Senator Accountability Act, 
was that senators must table one hour per semester. That’s abso-
lutely ridiculous. I spend more 
time in line at Chipotle. Senators should have ofﬁ  ce hours that, along with their pictures, should 
be posted on the SG website and 
in corresponding districts, dorms and colleges. That way, students 
will be able to recognize their rep-
resentatives, and they will know 
when and where they can be reached. Have your senators hosted a Town Hall forum? Are you like me and have never 
heard of such thing in your area or college? Don’t worry — 
take your concerns to ofﬁ  ce hours!  
Another facet SG can improve upon is networking. I try 
my best to keep up with what goes on throughout campus, but I had never heard of a senator-led Town Hall forum or 
an “SG TV” episode, and I know I’m not alone. SG should 
expand its effort, to announce these opportunities or provide alternative methods for student-representative communi-cation. Whether it’s installing a solar-powered slideshow screen with SG announcements or making a permanent sug-
gestion box on Turlington Plaza — in addition to the one on 
the website that nobody knows about — SG has plenty of options to connect better with students.
Finally, SG should announce Lunch on the Lawn events 
weeks in advance, and they should update the abandoned “News” section on their website. Election codes may explain inactivity on Swamp social media pages, but they don’t ex-cuse any of these incompetencies.
In his letter, Murphy wrote that I attempted to make the 
“case” that SG is not visible. I beg to differ. The case is closed, and the jury has deliberated; SG has ample room for im-provement. Hopefully now they know where they can start.

appears on Wednesdays.Alabama limbo 
good sign for nat’l 
marriage equality
Alabama began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex cou-
ples Monday. Well, parts of Alabama, anyway.
Similar to the preceding legalization of same-sex mar-
riage in Florida, the one in Alabama is highly contested — and may have implications for an impending Supreme Court deci-
sion this summer.
Federal courts struck down the state’s ban on same-sex mar-
riage Jan. 23. When the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and the 
Supreme Court did nothing to extend a hold on the decision due to end Monday, same-sex marriage became de facto legal in Alabama.
The decision isn’t coming easily, though. In the ﬁ  nal hours of 
Sunday, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore sent a decree out to all of the probate judges in the state barring the 
judges from issuing or recognizing marriage licenses to same-
sex couples. Alabama judges are caught in a quandary: refuse to marry couples and ﬂ  out federal court decisions, or issue licenses and defy a direct order from the most powerful state justice.
So far, 52 of Alabama’s 67 counties are following Moore’s or-
ders and aren’t issuing licenses. Compare that to the 13 of Flor-ida’s 67 counties that initially refused to hold weddings in their courthouses. These decisions certainly reﬂ  ect Alabama’s tem-perament toward same-sex marriage — but there’s a legal case 
to be made here. Yes, Moore described homosexuality as “in-
herently evil” in a 2002 court decision, but that particular view 
isn’t the ofﬁ  cial reason he issued his order. That’s to say, he’s not 
basing his legal argument on moral fervor and the threat of hell-
ﬁ  re. Rather, it’s a legal challenge to what he sees as the federal government’s overextension into state jurisdiction.
Alabama is continuing its ancient legacy of invoking state 
powers to defend existing hierarchies from federal efforts to change them, culminating in 1963 when Gov. George Wallace literally stood in the way of the ﬁ  rst black students to attend the University of Alabama during desegregation. Then, as now, the state’s rights were praised in contrast with those of power-hun-
gry federal organs. That Alabama has put up the most obstinate 
resistance to same-sex marriage so far should surprise no one.
It’s the state’s residents who have to deal with life in legal 
limbo, suspended between conﬂ  icting mandates. Same-sex mar-riage, in theory, is simultaneously legal and banned while its ef-fective legality depends on the discretion of the local judge.
In theory, the Supreme Court could extend the hold on the 
decision. Doing so would postpone legalization — and create the chaos we’re seeing now — until it makes a national decision 
on same-sex marriage. The court will start hearing cases in April, 
so Alabamians wouldn’t have too long to wait before a national constitutional decision is made.
But the Supreme Court isn’t postponing the decision, which 
we, as well as others, see as a sign that it will rule in favor of same-sex marriage this summer. While the situation in Alabama 
right now is less than ideal, it suggests a favorable decision from 
the highest court in the land — and we’re OK with that.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015

opinions@alligator.orgFirst of all:
1. If you’re under the age of 
21, avoid consuming alco-
hol! It IS possible to have a 
great Spring Break experi-
ence without alcohol being 
a part of it.
2. If you’re out with friends 
that are drinking and you do not want to drink, of-fer to be their designated driver or sober leader to 
get everyone back safely.
3. When going out anywhere 
on a Spring Break trip, there is safety in numbers! Go out as a group and look out for each other’s safety.
If you do decide to drink:
1. Before you drink, make 
sure to eat a full meal with some protein. Try to snack throughout the night if you can. Don’t believe the myth that food can sober a drunk person up; the only thing that sobers a drunk person up is time.
2. Be mindful of drinking outside in hot weather. Al-cohol is a diuretic, which can cause dehydration; mixing a diuretic in hot weather can lead to cramp-ing, exhaustion, and heat-stroke. 
3. Remember to pace and space! Stick to one alco-holic drink an hour (12 oz. of beer, 5 oz. of wine, or 1.5 oz. of liquor), but space those out further by drink-ing water or soda between alcoholic drinks.
4. Avoid drinking shots, play-ing drinking games, or combining alcohol with energy drinks. Fast con-sumption of alcohol, as well as combining alcohol with an energy drink, can lead to alcohol poisoning. 
5. Watch the bartender make or open your drink. Don’t accept drinks from strangers and keep an eye on your drink at all times to prevent someone from slipping something in your drink.
Safe travels and even safer party-ing!

Communication.
Boundaries. Consent.  Alex Lenzen, STRIVE Lead 
Peer Educator
What deﬁ  nes a 
healthy relation-
ship? Who decides what is healthy and what is not?
Healthy relationships al-
low all partners to feel sup-ported and connected yet 
also independent. Com-
munication, boundaries, and consent are three key 
ingredients to a healthy 
relationship. Ultimately, the people in the relation-
ship decide what is healthy 
for them and what is not.  If something doesn’t feel 
right, you should have the 
freedom to voice your con-cerns to your partner(s). Communication facilitates understanding and con-
nection. In a healthy relationship with good com-munication, partners:
 Treat each other with respect
 Can speak freely to one another about thoughts and feelings
 Listen to each other and compromise
 Feel heard when expressing feelings
 Celebrate each other’s accomplishments and suc-cesses
 Each person should feel able to express to their partner what they are and are not comfortable with. This includes, but is not limited to, sex life, ﬁ  nances, family and friends, personal space, and time. In a relationship with healthy boundaries, partners:
 Allow each other to spend time with friends and 
family
 Do not abuse technology to check on their 
partner(s)
 Trust each other and do not require their 
partner(s) to “check in”
 Do not pressure each other to do things that they don’t want to do
 Do not constantly accuse each other of cheating Consent allows partners to openly express what they like and want to experience.
 Consent is ongoing. Just because consent is given 
at one time, doesn’t mean it becomes a “given” 
every time. Consent can also be taken back at any time — even if you’re in the midst of something, you and your partner(s) always have the right to 
stop.
 Be speciﬁ  c.  Saying yes to one act doesn’t mean 
you have to consent to other acts. Each requires its own consent. Ex: Yes to intercourse ≠ yes to oral sex.
 Consent is required regardless of your relation-ship status. You can be married, friends with ben-eﬁ  ts, long term partners, or anything else and you still need to ask for and give consent. 
 There’s no such thing as implied consent. The 
absence of a “no” does not equal a “yes.” What a 
person chooses to wear doesn’t mean that they 
are consenting or inviting unwanted sexual atten-
tion. The same can be said for �lirting, going home 
with a person, or showing interest in a person in 
any other way.
 Consent cannot be coerced. If a person is afraid 
to say no, consent cannot take place. It’s also not consent if you or a partner is asleep, unconscious, or under the in�luence of alcohol or other drugs.
 Nonconsent means STOP. If anyone involved isn’t consenting, then what is happening is rape, sexu-al assault or abuse.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015  ALLIGATOR, 9

Accidents can happen:  Condoms 
can break because they are past 
the expiration date, stored improp-erly, or used incorrectly, especially in the heat of the moment. If you’re 
worried that a condom may break, 
you may want to keep the following points in mind.  should have the free-
dom to voice your concerns to your 
partner(s).Condoms, and other barrier meth-
ods, should never be stored in a wallet, 
car, or direct sunlight because heat, even body heat, weakens the product’s material over time. 
Oil-based lubricants cause condoms 
(both the ‘roll-on’ and ‘insertable’ ones) to break. Instead choose a water or silicone-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet, etc) which is safe for use with condoms by helping to prevent break-age by reducing friction, and can be used with other barrier methods, as well. Never use two ‘roll-on’ con-doms at once, or a ‘roll-on’ and ‘insertable’ condom to-gether, because the friction can cause both condoms to break. 
When using a condom, ﬁ  rst 
check the expiration date and squeeze the condom package to ensure it still has an air bubble (if it does not, the package and condom may be punctured). Open the package careful-ly (no teeth, nails, or scis-sors). For a ‘roll-on’ con-doms, pinch the tip of the condom to leave space for ejaculation and unroll the condom all the way down. 
A�ter sex, hold the base of 
the ‘roll-on’ condom be-fore withdrawing. 
If you or your partner ever ﬁ  nd yourself in a situation where a condom does break there are a few things to con-sider.  
If pregnancy prevention is a concern, consider following 
your condom breaking incident with Plan B.  Also known as emergency contraception, or EC, the high-dose birth control pill is available over-the-counter and can prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours. Plan B is most e�fective when within 24 hours.  
Women and men over 17 years 
of age can call a doctor, a health clinic, a pharmacy, or place an overnight order from Drugstore.com without a prescription.
If sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention is a concern, there are some things to consider.  
There are di�ferent ‘window peri-
ods’, or time it takes for the STI to be detected in a persons’ system, so the timing of testing is important.  
Check out this resource from the 
Centers for Disease Control & Pre-vention (CDC) to get a better idea of when/if you should get tested (https://gettested.cdc.gov/). When it does come time to test, there are some reason-ably priced or even free op-tions to consider on campus or in the Gainesville com-munity.  Free conﬁ  dential HIV testing for UF students is available on campus at the GatorWell main o�ﬁ  ce (352-273-4450) by appointment only.  HIV testing , as well as other STI testing (including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea and Syphilis), is also available at the Student Health Care Center (352-294-7465), Planned Parenthood of North Florida (352-377-0881) and at the Alachua County Health Depart-ment (352-334-7960). 
Depending on the site, pricing 
ranges from free to fees deter-mined by a sliding scale fee or based on your insurance.  10, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015
Beyond the Beach Body
With Spring Break just around the corner, you may be feeling an unpleasant pressure, in your own 
mind and from others, to have the perfect beach body. You are not alone in this. UF students across campus are experiencing the burden of negative body image. In the 2013 Healthy Gators survey of UF students, 23% of those who took the survey said feeling fat frequently interferes with enjoying everyday life, 18% of students worried about losing control over how much they eat,15% said that food dominates their life and 10% said they feel fat when others tell them they are too thin. to voice your concerns to your partner(s).

So, what exactly is body im-age? According to the Na-
tional Eating Disorder Asso-ciation, body image is how you view yourself in your mind or what you see when you look in the mirror. 
A person with a negative body image perception is 
dissatisﬁ  ed with their body. 
They have a somewhat dis-
torted view of their body. In-
stead of looking at their body 
as an indomitable whole, they 
may scrutinize certain parts of their body (thighs, stom-ach, arms, etc.) and label those parts inadequate. They feel ashamed, discontent and self-conscious about various as-pects of their body to a degree that causes anxiety. A person with a negative body image feels uncomfortable, disap-pointed and unhappy in their body. 
Apart from having an im-pact on everyday quality 
of life, negative body image perception is the best known contributor to the develop-ment of an eating disorder-a potentially fatal condition.So, what’s a Gator to do? You can promote positive body image and help create a culture of body acceptance at UF: Inspire others by being conﬁ  dent in who you are. Model posi-tive body talk for people around you.  For example: “I appreciate my body because…”
 Recognize that your body is not an ornament for others’ plea-sure/amusement, but a vehicle to reaching your life goals and aspirations. 
 Appreciate that people come in all shapes and sizes and em-bracing the diversity of all body types, shapes, sizes, colors! Cel-ebrate the diversity!
 Recognize that images you see in the media are highly altered and that you are likely programmed into accepting unrealistic body images. 
 Challenge these unrealistic images/messages by engaging in discussions about unrealistic images in the media.
 Understand that bodies can be healthy in many sizes; being a certain weight does not determine whether you’re healthy.
 Focus on positive traits of yourself and others that are not ap-pearance oriented.

In coach Billy Donovan’s 
eyes, the Gators truly played like 
Gators for the first time this sea-
son against Kentucky.
Florida played to its poten-
tial, showing up excited and en-
ergized for the matchup against 
the No. 1 team in the country 
who was undefeated coming into Gainesville.
Following the game, Dono-
van said “this game was lost in 
October” when players arrived 
at training camp and weren’t as motivated as they needed to be.
Lack of motivation resulted in 
a disappointing non-conference performance, with Florida drop-ping games to then-No. 5 North Carolina and then-No. 11 Kansas — games the Gators could have 
won to boost its subpar resume in an attempt to reach a postseason tournament.  Kentucky was not the first 
ranked opponent UF had played, but it was supposedly the best.
The top team in the country 
had swept through almost every team it had faced, and Florida 
had them on the ropes before eventually falling 68-61 on Sat-urday.
Donovan said on Monday that 
many of the Gators suffer from motivational issues. 
To Donovan, the team has a 
problem developing a sense of urgency. 
It often has played down to its 
opponents and this has caused Donovan to say the Gators may have difficulty motivating them-
selves.
“I mean, heck, if you can’t get 
excited to play in a game like that 
then you’ve got some serious is-sues, just calling it like it is,” 
Donovan said about the team’s 
motivation against Kentucky. “That’s my thing about being externally motivated. How can 
you come out Tuesday that way 
(against Vanderbilt) and Satur-day (against Kentucky) the next? And that’s the more I’m around these guys I’ll just say it like it is, 
the more I’m around them, they 
as a group they’ve got to be more internally driven and competi-tive than they are.”
Donovan said he’s taken it 
upon himself to change the mind-set of the team and help fix poor tendencies that have plagued

Jim McElwain’s first coaching staff is 
complete. 
UF announced the hire of Kerry Dixon 
II as wide receivers coach on Tuesday. 
Dixon brings a decade of experience on 
the offensive side of the ball throughout his career.
“Kerry is a young, energetic, up-and-
coming coach,” McElwain said in a re-lease. 
“He has strong recruiting ties through-
out the state and as a former offensive co-ordinator he will bring value to the offen-sive game plan.”
Dixon, a native of Houston, has spent 
the last three seasons in the state of Florida coaching running backs at FIU and FAU. 
Prior to that, Dixon coached running 
backs at Montana State and was the offen-sive coordinator at Stillman College.
Dixon steps into a coaching position 
that has been in a constant state of flux. 
For the last five seasons, no coach has 
spent more than one year at the position and it’s experienced strange exits like Au-brey Hill resigning for “personal reasons” and Joker Phillips calling it quits in June of last season.
The wide receivers 
coaching position has also featured at one time, a graduate assistant and at another, former quar-terback Chris Leak who had previously been a quality control coach. 
Leak is no longer on 
Florida’s staff, and McElwain hopes this wide receivers coach will be the one that sticks.Florida hires new wide

Equipped with an electric offense, 
the UF softball team stormed into Tam-
pa and won every game they played to open up the season — highlighted by a Gator lineup that clobbered eight home runs in five games.
The Gators, now 5-0, amassed 46 
runs in the five games they played in 
the USF Softball Classic – an average of 
9.2 runs per game.
“I thought our at-bats from not only 
our older players but our younger play-ers were very consistent,” coach Tim Walton said. “They were very profes-
sional”
Kirsti Merritt 
was a spark plug 
and a big source of Florida’s power 
surge – the junior hit three home runs, all on Sunday – two of which came in UF’s 9-0 win against Jacksonville Uni-versity.
On top of her three blasts, Merritt hit 
two doubles and knocked in nine runs as part of a 6-for-11 outing at the plate over the three-day tournament.
“Saturday, I didn’t do so good, I 
went 0-4 on Saturday,” Merritt said. “Sunday, I swung at much better pitch-UF riding momentum from

Heading into the final indoor meet before the Southeastern 
Conference Indoor Championships, the No. 2 Florida men’s 
and women’s track and field teams are right where coach Mike 
Holloway wants them to be.As of now, the Gators are in position to hold 19 individual 
and four quartet spots in the NCAA Indoor Championships, 
including three sprinters in the women’s 200-meter run. Florida 
holds the top spots in four events, including the 400-meter run 
held by junior Najee Glass, who set a world-best in the event at the Razorback Invitational.  
Jumpers Marquis Dendy and KeAndre Bates and sprinter 
Robin Reynolds are all on the brink of qualifying for two sepa-
rate events.
“We’ve done a great job of progressing week by week,” Hol-
loway said. “I’m very pleased of where the team is from that 
point.”
While success has not been hard to find for the Gators this 
season, Holloway pointed out that there is plenty of room for improvement for his squad, especially when it comes to the short-sprint and hurdle events.
In the 60-meter dash, the men’s side is lead by senior sprint-
er Hugh Graham Jr., who is tied for 14th in the NCAA in the event. While he sits in a qualifying position now, he is only two-hundredths of a second from becoming a runner who is on the outside looking in.
On the women’s side, junior Shayla Sanders ranks 10th in 
the country in the 60 dash, which, in an event as fast as it, is too close for comfort.
In the 60-meter hurdles, senior Bridgette Owens is tied for 
first in the country for the women, but Florida’s next best time comes from sophomore hurdler Skylar Ross-Ransom, who is tied for 39th in the NCAA.
For the men, sophomore Yanick Hart is the only hurdler 
ranked in the top-50, but still is not set to qualify as he is sitting 
at 17th in the country.
“The goal is to have somebody in every sprint and hurdle 
event at the national meet,” Holloway said.
To achieve this goal, Holloway says that he needs to be on 
the short-sprinters’ tails in the weeks leading up to the NCAAs.
The 13th-year head coach is making it a priority to improve 
Sanders’ time and to work with Hart and junior sprinter Ant-
wan Wright on qualifying for the NCAA meet.
The Gator men have yet to run anyone in the 200-meter 
run this season, but that will change this weekend, as Bower-man Trophy Preseason Watch List nominee Dedric Dukes and Wright will compete in the event at the Tyson Invitational.WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015  ALLIGATOR, 15

The UF men’s and women’s swimming and 
diving teams will travel to Auburn, Alabama, 
on Sunday and relax, per coach Gregg Troy’s orders.
The Southeastern Conference Champion-
ships begin Tuesday and last five days, but Troy said the teams will need time to adjust for the “very closely-contested meet.”
“On paper, Georgia is probably the best team 
— the team to beat on both the men and wom-en’s side,” Troy said.
Last season, the Georgia men’s placed third 
at the SEC Championships, while the women took the crown.
However, Florida’s No. 1 men’s team should 
also be wary of Auburn, where the teams will be on home territory. The No. 5 Auburn men’s team finished second last year and the year be-fore, both to Florida.
In 2013, Florida broke Auburn’s streak of 
16-straight SEC Championships, which was the third longest streak of all sports in the confer-ence’s history.
Seniors Matt Elliott, Dan Wallace and Edu-
ardo Solaeche-Gomez each said their favorite memory as a swimmer at Florida was the team’s first time winning SEC Championships in 2013.
“It’s why you come to Florida,” Troy said. 
“You want to be competing for this type of situ-
ation, and it’s double-important because we 
have a lot of guys qualified for the NCAA meets so it carries a bigger weight for them.”

A few days before its season 
opener, one word is making its way 
around Florida’s clubhouse.
“A lot of us have integrated the 
word ‘Omaha’ into our daily vo-
cabulary,” junior left-hander Danny 
Young said.
Omaha, Nebraska — the site of 
the College World Series.
It’s also the place where UF ex-
pected to end its season last year. Now, the word serves as motivation.
“The way it ended was disap-
pointing but the season overall was not a disappointing season,” said Young, who went 5-0 on the mound last year with a 2.23 ERA. “I mean, obviously no one wants to go two-and-out when you’re the number two national seed. Quite frankly, we have to be better than that.”
Florida thinks it will be.Its pitching staff is deeper, with 
sophomores Logan Shore and A.J. 
Puk likely solidifying at least two 
starting roles, and experienced left-ies Bobby Poyner, Young and other 
reliable arms waiting in the bullpen.
The defense has more poten-
tial, with Richie Martin returning at shortstop, Harrison Bader and Buddy Reed anchoring the outfield, and freshman Dalton Guthrie taking over for Casey Turgeon at second base.
Its batting or-
der has more pow-er, with sopho-more Peter Alonso 
getting the nod at right field in order to bring more of-fense to the lineup.
And even 
though coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan will likely use a two-catcher rotation for most of the season, freshman catcher JJ Schwarz has impressed nearly everyone. 
In high school, Schwarz tallied a 
.361 batting average with 33 RBIs, 15 runs and seven homers.
“As far as freshmen hitters I’ve 
faced throughout my three years, he might be the best just pure hitter,” Young said. “I mean, some guys just have a feel for hitting.”
That was evident when Schwarz 
hit a ball 404 feet into the media tow-er on Monday during practice.
“It was pretty high up so I give 
it like 430 (feet) maybe,” Reed said. “He’s definitely come on strong in the fall and the spring. I would defi-nitely say he’s ready to play the sea-son.”
Poyner added that everyone is 
eager to start the season, and that the improvement of returning play-ers and the addition of talented freshman like Schwarz has given the team more confidence than in year’s past.
“I feel really good with all of our 
young guys,” Poyner said. “I feel like they really know what they’re doing, especially at the plate… I think they’re gonna make a huge impact right away.”
For UF, right away can’t come 
soon enough.
“Were sick of playing each oth-
er,” Young said. “We’re ready to face somebody else.”

In only the second game of the regular season, Florida is 
looking to right the ship. 
The No. 4 Gators (0-1) travel to Jacksonville today to face 
the Dolphins at 7 p.m. in what will be JU’s season opener. 
Florida won last year’s meeting between the two pro-
grams 21-5 and owns a 5-0 all-time record against the Dol-
phins.
The Gators are coming off of a 
loss to No. 2 North Carolina on Sat-urday so, in a quick turnaround, they will look to clean up their mistakes 
against Jacksonville.
Florida aims to fire on all cylinders in an attempt to fix 
the issues it saw on film against UNC. Redshirt junior Nicole 
Graziano, who had a career-high six draw controls on Satur-
day, said today’s game will be a great chance for the Gators to get back on track and get one in the win column.
“We’re definitely gonna learn from UNC,” Graziano said, 
“and have a good opportunity (Wednesday) to bounce back.”UF lacrosse facing

At 5-foot-4, Merritt may not 
seem threatening at the plate, but 
the center fielder packs a powerful 
punch. 
She hit 13 home runs last season 
in 187 at-bats – which was second best on the team.
Merritt said she’s often asked 
how she generates her power de-spite her small frame.
“Just use your legs,” she said. 
“That’s what I tell little girls, ‘even though you’re small, look at me, you have to use your legs when you’re hitting.’”
With three home runs under her 
belt in only 11 at-bats this season, Merritt said one reason she’s be-come a better hitter is because she and Walton made a mechanical ad-
justment to her swing.
“She swings so hard that she 
has a hitch so when she’s swinging 
she wants to jack the ball,” Walton said. “Her swing would almost go backwards when it should be get-ting into its launch position.”
Now, Merritt starts in a bunt po-
sition when hitting and brings the bat back before she swings, which is used as a timing mechanism.
“I think it’s already improved 
my swing like 100 times better,” Merritt said. “I started in the postseason last year and it really helped my swing and it’s already moved over to this season.”
Merritt and the Gators will look 
to continue their hot hitting as they face Jacksonville tonight in Jack-sonville (2-3) at 6. Florida is 13-0 all-time against the Dolphins.
Despite the offensive numbers 
UF put up over the weekend, Wal-ton said the team will have to play better defense in tonight’s game 
and this weekend’s home games 
after Florida committed six errors during the tournament.
“The offensive stuff that we’re 
doing, that doesn’t win you cham-pionships,” he said. “It might look good on the scoreboard 17-0, but it doesn’t win you championships – we’re gonna have to play way bet-16, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2015

On Tuesday’s third and final round of the 
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, Flor-
ida’s women’s golf team looked to improve on their fifth place standing. 
A strong performance would have solidified 
themselves a top spot in the leaderboards. 
Instead, they went in a different direction, 
struggling throughout the final round. 
Florida finished the tournament in 10th 
place, 31 strokes behind first place Baylor. 
“Today was a disappointing finish to the 
tournament,” coach Emily Glaser said in a re-lease. 
“We started off flat and we were never able 
to recover.”
However, Glaser is still keeping a positive 
mindset moving forward.“Today was just one of many rounds we will 
play this spring and it alone does not define us,” she said. 
“We will use this trip to get better and be a 
stronger team.”
Freshman Taylor Tomlinson, who entered 
the day with a team best score of +3, finished Tuesday’s round six-over-par, bringing her 
tournament total to +9, putting her in a tie for 
21st in the leaderboards. 
This was her second top-25 finish this sea-
son.
Junior Ursa Orehek finished her day at five-
over-par, moving her three round total to +14, placing her in a tie for 44th in the individual leaderboards.
The Gators will tee off next for the Allstate 
Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Golf Championship on Feb. 22-24.Women’s golf finishes in 10thJordan McPherson  / Alligator Staff
Kirsti Merritt steps up to bat during Florida’s 17-1 win against USF on April 23 at Katie Sea -
shole Pressly Stadium. The Gators take on Jacksonville tonight at 6. 
UF needs to play like it 
did against Kentucky
them in their basketball careers 
to this point.
“I am trying to change mental 
disposition and habits that these guys have had their whole entire life, and these experiences are hopefully changing their mental 
approach to competing,” Dono-
van said.  
“And I feel like that’s like my 
No. 1 job for them to be success-ful even when they leave here.”
If anything, Donovan is sur-
prised it’s taken this long for the Gators to play with the intensity that their talent levels require. 
Everything has come so easily 
to many players in their careers that they haven’t had to work 
hard.
Until now.
“There are games where the 
game is sometimes bigger than 
yourself,” Donovan said. 
“That was a game (against 
Kentucky) that was bigger than 
them. I’m not so sure the games that we’ve played this year, they 
haven’t thought at times they’re 
bigger than the game.”
With Florida playing for its 
season — needing every win to 
improve it’s long-shot odds of 
making the NCAA tournament – Donovan hopes that the new-found awareness of the needed intensity isn’t too little too late. HOOPS , from page 14Merritt had three home runs, nine RBIs in USF Softball Classic
