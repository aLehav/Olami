◗ UF linebackers Jelani 
Jenkins and Jon Bostic 
have started a combined 
six career games. But their performances last 
week give fans a reason 
to be optimistic about the Gators’ defense.
See Story, Page 14.
Chasing Two  DreamsA student-athlete is presented with two 
options: run as fast as you can to chase 
gold medals on a worldwide stage or 
play in America’s most popular professional 
league and make millions of dollars.
This is the dilemma Jeff Demps faces.
The junior running back has flown past 
defenders to earn the attention of NFL scouts 
and has broken records on his way to win-
ning a track and field national champion-
ship that has many anointing him a potential 
Olympian.
“It’s definitely not easy if you love each 
sport,” said Daymon Carroll, who ran track 
at UF and was a running back on the 1996 na-
tional championship team. “It’s just not go-
ing to be an easy decision either way. But it’s 
just making a decision and living with it.”
With pros and cons on each side, there 
will be plenty for the speedster, who is eli-gible to enter the NFL Draft after this season, 
to consider.
Out of the Blocks
Despite running a 9.96 to win the 
100-meter national title at the 2010 NCAA Championships in June, running track didn’t 
always come naturally to Demps.
“He had a lot to learn,” said Teri Batts, a 
data-entry specialist at Groveland South Lake High School who acted as Demps’ guidance 
counselor. “He had to do a lot of extra work-
outs, and then it became an issue of trying to stay in shape year-round and for two entirely 
different sports. He needed weight for foot-
ball and less body fat and weight for track.”
Demps took up track at the beginning 
of his junior year in high school and never looked back, running past the competition in the process.
His legs led him to a 10.37 100-meter dash, 
the fastest time ever recorded at the Florida 
state final.
And his success has carried over to UF, 
where he won a national championship in the sport last spring.
Florida track and field coach Mike 
Holloway knows Demps could run in the 
Olympics if that’s what he decides to pur -
sue.
“No doubt in my mind,” he said. “[He’s] 
that gifted, he’s that poised and he’s that 
confident in himself.”
But Carroll knows the negative side to 
running track for a living. He estimates that 
an average track and field athlete makes 
$50,000 per year, not accounting for travel expenses.
Only the top runners earn millions of dol-
lars, something Demps is not guaranteed — 
unlike football.
“If you have a hamstring injury or some 
little nicks, that can throw your whole season off and you can lose a potential of a quarter-
million dollars. That’s what’s so tricky with 
track and field,” Carroll said.
“As for football, when I was playing they 
didn’t have guaranteed contracts, now they have guaranteed contracts. So pretty much, 
you know you have money coming.”
But a chance at an Olympic medal and a 
career featuring thousands fewer hits from 
larger men could be enough to offset that.
Out of the Backfield
Unlike track, where he specializes in the 
shorter events, Demps is known as a back that 
can break a long play at any moment in foot-ball.
His 4.3 40-yard-dash speed earned him that 
label, and Demps credits track for his straight-ahead running style.
“That had a lot to do with it,” he said of his 
track mindset compared to football. “It was al-ways go straight or one left turn, then go straight again.”
Before this season, Demps thrived in a sys-
tem in which he split carries. But this year he is showing he can carry an offense.
The junior is averaging nearly seven yards 
per rush and is responsible for 33 percent of the Gators’ total offense. He is now an every-down back, a receiver out of the backfield and a kick returner.
Demps ranks third in the country with 196.7 
all-purpose yards per game.
Still, his NFL potential is in question.“He’s a draftable kid, but I don’t see a first-
rounder or second-rounder right now,” an NFL scout for one NFC team said. “He’s not going to last as a running back because he doesn’t start and stop like (Tennessee Titans running back) Chris Johnson. I don’t think he’s as strong as (Minnesota Vikings and former UF receiver Percy) Harvin, but there are similarities. 
“He’s going to be drafted, it’s just too early to 
figure out where.”
Many doubt Demps’ ability to run between 
the tackles and his durability, and others won-der if his track career is getting in the way of his future in football. 
One day , like most two-sport athletes, 
Demps will have to settle that second question for himself.
“I just started to realize how difficult it was to 
play two sports, especially at a top-notch school 
like Florida and a top-notch conference like the 
Southeastern Conference,” Carroll said.Decision Time
Demps isn’t putting off his choice.
He has been mulling over his two options 
with Batts — who still calls and texts him af-
ter games — since the 11th grade, and she’s 
certain football is the route Demps wants to 
pursue.
“It’s just what he loves since he was a 
very, very young child,” Batts said. “He just 
loves it.”
Holloway agrees.
Because of the potential money the NFL 
offers, he’ll support his track star-turned-
football star’s decision either way.
“I don’t know how he doesn’t think about 
it, but it’s not something we talk about,” 
Holloway said. “But there is no doubt in my 
mind that Jeff wants to play in the NFL and he wants to be one of those guys that you 
watch on TV playing on Sundays.”
For now, Demps will keep up his dual-
sport role and keep both options open.
Unlike former Gators athlete John Capel, 
he won’t rush to a final decision.
In 2000, Capel, a UF wide receiver who 
excelled in track, left after his sophomore season to pursue his sprinting dream. 
Capel made the 200-meter finals at the 2000 
Olympics in Sydney but finished eighth, and he wasn’t able to spin a seventh-round 
selection in the 2001 NFL Draft into a foot-ball career.
Much like waiting for a block before ac-
celerating through the hole, Demps knows he must be patient and wait for the best path to open up.
“It wasn’t that hard,” Demps said of turn-
ing down a potential track career early on. 
“It’s money, but it’s not like what you get in 
football. Football is my first option.”Editor Anthony Chiang    ◗  Cover Photo Harrison Diamond

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The 
seventh trial for a South Florida man ac-
cused of killing his ex-girlfriend in 2001 has ended in a mistrial.
The latest trial for 49-year-old Alan Ruff 
started Monday and ended the next day af-ter several jurors said they had read about the case in the news. 
One juror even announced that he 
thought he had served as a juror in one of Ruff’s previous trials.Ruff’s ex-girlfriend, Traci Cooper, was 
fatally stabbed at the air conditioning re-pair office where she worked.
A Broward County jury convicted Ruff 
in 2007 of first-degree murder, but an ap-peals court in February overturned the conviction and sent the case back for a new trial.
Besides the overturned conviction, the 
case has previously ended in two other mistrials and three hung juries.

Former Florida governor Kenneth H. “Buddy” MacKay answers a question during a 
Graham Center event in the Pugh Hall Ocora on Thursday night. 
By C.J. PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
When Buddy MacKay returned to Flori-
da after serving in the U.S. Air Force in the 
1950s, he saw a state in desperate need of 
development and renovation. 
Yet more than a decade removed from 
his service in a state government that has overseen numerous changes, he still sees a 
state in need of improvement. 
In an hour-long speech at Pugh Hall on 
Thursday night, MacKay, a former state 
representative and senator, U.S. congress-
man, lieutenant governor and governor, 
regaled the audience with tales of his days in government and discussed his views on Florida’s current state.
MacKay, who was not paid for his ap-
pearance, lamented the bipartisan divide that has engulfed Florida politics, describ-ing politicians who refuse to compromise as nothing more than glorified political 
bumper stickers.
“I see the system being systematically 
designed as impossible,” he said. “I don’t 
think I could serve there.”
When asked what steps Florida should 
take to fix its current problems, MacKay said lawmakers should employ “root ca-nal” solutions, those that will hurt in the short term, but it will provide a better long-term outcome, such as continuing to fund education amid an economic reces-
sion. 
In terms of Florida’s future, MacKay 
insisted that lawmakers maintain a sense 
of discipline and political maturity when considering solutions for the state.  
“The older our population is becoming, 
the more politically immature we’re be-coming,” he said. “We’re becoming a big political adolescent.” 
The former governor also offered advice 
for the current gubernatorial candidates, advising whoever wins the November contest to stand strong against a legisla-ture that will, he said, attempt to run the executive branch.
Former Sen. Bob Graham, who intro-
duced MacKay to the audience before the event, gave his former colleague high praise, calling him a person that could make someone proud of democracy.
“If there was such a thing as a hall of 
fame, he would be voted in on the first class,” Graham said.Former gov. weighs in 
on political landscape

SOUTHWEST REC, TURLINGTON, THE REITZ UNION AND OTHER CAMPUS LOCATIONS. THE

With Student Government elections looming, candi-
dates are hitting the pavement and making their case to 
students about why their positions stand above the oth-
ers.
Progress Party President Dave Schneider said his par -
ty’s candidates are talking to students in the dorms they 
hope to represent, noting that his party will be promoting their platform on the Plaza of the Americas on Friday.
“Students are obviously going to be more receptive be-
cause they’re targeted to their needs, so that’s what we’re 
going for,” Schneider said.
Micah Lewis, Unite Party spokesman, said the Unite 
Party has tables set up at a number of locations.
Students can ask questions about 
the Unite Party and its platform at 
Southwest Recreation Center, Turlington Plaza, the Reitz Union, Broward Hall and Matherly Hall.
“We’re just spreading the word as much as we can 
about our platform,” he said.
He said a lot of students are asking questions about the party and the election in general.
“They all seem very curious how to find out how to 
get involved and how to participate in this fall’s election,” Lewis said.
Alan Yanuck, who is running independently for the 
Student Senate seat representing Keys Residential Com-plex, said he is also answering a lot of questions for stu-dents, mostly about SG and his personal platform for the 
complex.
Michael Morales, who is running to represent the Lake-
side area, said he is is doing all he can to get the word out 
about his campaign to all the residents. 
“It’s a word-of-mouth campaign I’m running right 
now,” Morales said.Student government candidates push platforms

 DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SAID SHE WAS 
BORDERLINE MENTALLY DISABLED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
JARRATT, Va. — The first woman executed in the United 
States in five years was put to death in Virginia on Thursday for arranging the killings of her husband and a stepson over a $250,000 insurance payment.
Teresa Lewis, 41, died by injection at 9:13 p.m. Thursday, 
authorities said. She became the first woman executed in Virginia in nearly a century. Supporters and relatives of the victims watched her execution at Greensville Correctional Center in Jarratt.
Lewis enticed two men through sex, cash and a promised cut in an insurance policy to shoot her husband, Julian Clif-ton Lewis Jr., and his son, Charles, as they slept in October 2002. Both triggermen were sentenced to life in prison and 
one committed suicide in 2006.
Lewis appeared fearful, her jaw clenched, as she was es-
corted into the death chamber. She glanced tensely around 
at 14 assembled corrections officials before being bound to a 
gurney with heavy leather straps.
Moments before her execution, Lewis 
asked if her husband’s daughter was near.
Kathy Clifton, Lewis’ stepdaughter, was in 
an adjacent witness room blocked from her view by a two-way mirror.
“I want Kathy to know that I love her and I’m very sorry,” 
Lewis said.Then, as the drugs flowed into her body, her feet bobbed 
but she otherwise remained motionless. A guard lightly tapped her on the shoulder reassuringly as she slipped into 
death.
More than 7,300 appeals to stop the execution — the first of 
a woman in Virginia since 1912 — had been made to the gov-
ernor in a state second only to Texas in the number of people it executes.
Texas held the most recent U.S. execution of a woman in 
2005. Out of more than 1,200 people put to death since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, only 11 have been women.
The 41-year-old woman, who defense attorneys said was 
borderline mentally disabled, had inspired other inmates by 
singing Christian hymns in prison. First woman in five years executed in US amid outcry

UF students can now plan their week-
ends on their iPhones, thanks to a new ap-
plication from a local company.
CitiSync, a web and mobile applica-
tion that helps students discover and share what’s happening in the Gainesville area, launched an  iPhone application this week.
The application was created by recent UF 
graduate Adam Coelho.
Coelho said he created CitiSync because 
he wanted to provide UF students with a more connected college experience. 
The company’s iPhone application al-
lows students to browse UF campus events, as well as Gainesville food and drink spe-cials, concerts and nightlife.CitiSync has a website, citisync.com, but 
is trying to make all of its content as mobile as possible, Coelho said.
“People don’t make plans to go out and 
do things sitting in front of their computer,” 
he said. “They’re on the bus or standing 
in line at the Hub, and that’s when they’re thinking about what they want to do that night.”
CitiSync’s application is free can be found 
by searching the company name. 
Students can browse events by date or by category. 
They can save events on the application 
and upload the information to Facebook or Twitter.
CitiSync employs 17 UF students as in-
terns.
The company wants to focus on events 
for people who are younger than 21.
“We’re a little bit different than everyone 
who’s come before us,” Coelho said. “We 
kind of get lumped together with all of those 
people – they either think we’re a promotion company or a drink specials website. What they don’t realize is that we’ve been around for over a year.”
Students can visit www.citisync.com/ip-
hone to learn more about CitiSync’s iPhone application. 
Coelho said the company is currently 
working on an application for the Droid smart phone.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 24, 2010

In keeping with the sweeping tech-
nological changes in the media indus-
try, the UF College of Journalism and 
Communications will be opening the 21st Century News Laboratory today. 
The invitation-only grand opening, 
which will take place in the lab on the 
ground floor of Weimer Hall at 3:30 
p.m., represents the first installment in the three-part Center for Media Inno-vation and Research.
The 21st Century News Laboratory 
will allow journalism and telecommu-nication students to receive hands-on experience working with multimedia platforms in print, TV , radio and the web. 
Students will also have access to a 
1,200 square foot production studio 
with high-definition video cameras, a 
green screen, an interview set and a video wall containing nine 46-inch HD LCD monitors that will display cur -
rent projects and recent news. 
The lab will contain five worksta-
tions where students can plug in their 
computers and access research materials simul-
taneously. In addition to 
the laboratory, there is a 
conference room where students can plan, discuss and present projects on a 52-inch HD monitor. 
David Carlson, executive director 
of the Center for Media Innovation and Research, expressed his excite-ment at the prospect of unveiling the 
news lab.
“The center will allow faculty and 
students to tell stories in new ways,” 
he said. Journalism school to open

Today’s question: Do you prefer 
winter or summer in Gainesville?Thursday’s question: Was the Philadelphia Daily News’ ‘top dog’ headline in poor taste?
56 TOTAL VOTES38% YES62% NOColumnist looks to winter with dread
After the blur that was my 21st birthday, I found myself sober enough to realize fall was officially upon us. I don’t know about you, but I sincerely 
detest fall.
Sure, it arrives with a few perks like pumpkin spice 
lattes, pretty leaves, football season and the return of “Glee.” But fall always leaves me feeling bitter and fatter.
Whoever decided to combine cold weather, exams and 
Thanksgiving all into one season was obviously not con-cerned with stress eating. Throw in the regrets of your summer vacation and you want to enter hibernation until 
spring.
Each year we go through the same routines, much like 
the seasons, and each year around the same time, I get 
smacked in the face with my summer mistakes.
So it’s no surprise fall is my least favorite season as I 
always enter it content, tan and optimistic but somehow 
always leave it depressed, pale and bitter.
Just to add to my hatred, Gainesville likes to play pre-
tend and becomes a tundra during a few winter months. 
The temperature drops to the low 30s, frost forms on windshields and terrible overlayering causes everyone to become the same shape.
It doesn’t even stop there. Halfway through November, 
Gainesville forgets it’s located in Florida and enters winter a few weeks early. The wind blows all the leaves off the trees and the sky becomes perpetually gray but snow is never to be seen.
And, of course, Thanksgiving falls perfectly in place 
during the last few weeks of the semester. Sure, celebrat-ing the genocide of the Native Americans has become an American staple, but dealing with extended family and upcoming finals can seriously be a traumatic experience. So, to cope with stress I eat my feelings – and grades – away.
The pounds begin to add up 
and soon the cold begins to com -
pel me into becoming a solitary creature. I begin to dread the thought of going outside, know-ing at least three layers of cloth-ing would be required and, even then, the wind will be enough to 
make me shiver.
So I slowly become a hermit. Real friends get pushed 
aside for my Netflix account and the sight of sunlight be-
comes a thing of the past.
When I do escape to the outside world, things aren’t 
any better. 
The cold is worse than what I always expect, and the 
population of Gainesville hides from the cold inside its homes. The streets look deserted, the classes partially 
empty, the lines at the Hub slightly smaller. The tempera-ture drops, the sun hides and the depression builds.
At this point the lack of sun has caused my skin to be-
come pale, my Snuggie to become a permanent accessory, and my eyes to have some serious photosensitivity. 
I even convinced myself one year I had mysteriously 
become a vampire, Snuggie cape and all. 
Being delusional is one of the added perks of fall.Eventually, winter arrives with Christmas in tow. My 
spirits are refreshed and my binge-eating ways replaced with New Year’s resolutions. The temperatures are still unbearable, but at least now I can say spring is just around the corner. 
Hassan Casanova is a third-year family, youth and community 
sciences student at Santa Fe College. His column appears every 
Friday. Since we last left you, the gems of our Gator Nation, we 
were enjoying the last bit of the summer season we still had left. 
We were still confused at Jamba Juice offering pump-
kin smoothies and Starbucks offering its we-don’t-even-care-how-many-calories-are-in-that-artificial-autumn-fla-vored-syrup pumpkin spice lattes. 
So, here we find ourselves, Gators. We’re once again 
stuck at the time of year when we just don’t know when 
to unpack our autumn home décor and when to put away 
our bikinis until Halloween when they’ll undoubtedly come back out. 
And in light of that complete confusion, the Department 
of Darts and Laurels would like to present you with your 
very own Don’t-Unpack-The-Cornucopias-And-Plastic-
Pumpkins-Just-Yet-Even-If-Starbucks-Wants-Us-All-To-Believe-It’s-Autumn edition of......
Darts & Laurels
But, really, it’s fall. Officially.Oh, wait, you all couldn’t tell? Neither could we. We still can’t walk on campus without sweating. 
The proliferation of sweaty upper lips and armpit stains 
are seriously affecting our swag. 
And we think it’s getting hotter. 
Seriously, we’re sweating even when walking in the air 
conditioning. 
So for giving The Swamp a whole different meaning 
and leaving no end in sight to the 90-degree heat in late 
September, we’re throwing a We-Just-Want-To-Wear-
Our-Scarves DART at La Nina, El Nino, the weather gods 
and/or Mother Nature.
We seriously don’t know who to be mad at. But the weather isn’t the only crazy thing happening 
recently. 
A tea party favorite is generating some news we just 
want to send a muffin basket for.
Christine O’Donnell, the GOP darling looking to seize 
Vice President Biden’s former Senate seat in Deleware surged to the national spotlight with her recent primary win. And then a video surfaced of her saying she “dabbled 
in witchcraft.” 
Nope, she didn’t attend anti-war rallies. And God for -
bid a tea party candidate have a history of social welfare 
reform. But witchcraft?
This is the kind of bizarre, wacky news we just can’t 
make up. 
So, for giving us something to laugh about, we’re flick-
ing our wand and making a We-Only-Hope-You-Were-A-Slytherin-So-We-Don’t-Feel-Bad-For-making-Fun-Of-You 
LAUREL to Christine O’Donnell. May the force be with 
you. But not in November.
We realize not everything is this happy. 
The U.S. Senate killed the dreams of Hispanics and gay 
Americans across the country this week by not being able 
to garner enough votes to move forward with a vote on the 
defense bill that tacked on a provision to enact the DREAM Act and another to end “don’t ask, don’t tell.”
And when we say “the U.S. Senate,” we really mean 
“Republican senators and the state of Arkansas.”
For making us ashamed of our leaders, we’re throwing 
a We-Can-Only-Hope-November-Proves-Well-For-Fu-ture-Chances-Of-Equality DART at Senate Republicans 
and those from Arkansas. Thanks for distancing yourself 
from progression. 
Put the scarf down until next week, Gators.

Letters to the Editor
Reader urges students to vote 
independent 
I try not to get too involved in Student Gov-
ernment politics; it makes your head spin after 
awhile. But after reading Wednesday’s letters, I have to ask the question: Why are the current SG officials (i.e., the Unite Party via longtime 
Student Sen. Matt Michel and Unite operative 
Dana Summerstein) so threatened by the up-and-coming reformers? 
By now it’s obvious Unite and its Progress 
Party sidekicks have gone full red alert at the possibility that someone might actually make things better in SG.
The status quo parties have tried to smear 
and attack the Independent Coalition, an un-
derdog group of candidates with a lot more 
ideas and a lot less money than Unite, because the independents are for real change.
If you care about real issues like Bright 
Futures, saving student money and having a voice that will stand up to the administration and to UPD when necessary, I urge you to join me in supporting the independent candidates 
in this election.

Independent candidates share common 
goals
I’m getting tired of this. 
During the past few days I’ve had my par -
ty’s honor called into question by a Progress Party candidate, a UF Supreme Court Justice and a Unite Party senator. And after being 
called a liar and a schemer, I’d like to respond 
by saying we screwed up. It happens. We at-tached the wrong form to our e-mail to the su-pervisor of elections. There wasn’t a devious plan; it was a mistake. We sent it five hours early, but the supervisor of elections wasn’t able to get back to us to fix the mistake in 
time.
But instead of beating ourselves up, we told 
all of our candidates what happened, and you 
know what? They all still wanted to run. 
These are 24 individuals, most of whom 
have  never participated in Student Govern-ment before, who didn’t need a party to back them up in order to run. We can’t run as a party this time, but we’re united by common 
goals. 
When you go to vote Tuesday and Wednes-
day our names will be there listed as indepen-
dents, and we can’t change that. 
But for the time being, when we’re out cam-
paigning and are mentioned in the paper, we are going to refer to ourselves as the Indepen-dent Coalition, and those of us who win will affiliate with the Student Alliance caucus, be-
cause that’s what we wanted in the first place.

Learning is undead 
In his column “Zombie attack bad for uni-
versity image,” Sean Quinn states, “above all 
else UF is a four-year research institution, fo-cused on educating its students to their fullest potentials.” I would argue this is exactly why 
alternate reality games like Humans vs. Zom-
bies (HvZ) should have a place on campus.
Students playing HvZ constitute a highly 
participatory culture. They are students inter -
ested in collaborating, communicating, creat-ing and having fun outside the walls of the tra-ditional classroom. UF can be proud that with about 1,000 students, the Gators HvZ group is one of the largest internationally . 
Purdue University, another top-ranked in-
stitution, is the only school with more players.
HvZ is not a frivolous game of tag. The 
game lasts multiple days because it involves “missions,” or complex team-based problem-solving tasks. 
Missions challenge players to use a variety 
of skills to complete that require students to synthesize digital, printed and geo-based in-formation. 
Furthermore, to survive as humans, stu-
dents must practice forming affiliations, col-laborating within those groups and communi-cating across groups.
Beyond the players, the moderator team is 
a highly creative group of UF students who are writing narratives that inspire hundreds of their peers to participate in an intricate perfor -
mance piece that lasts for days. 
In each instance of the game, moderators 
carefully craft stories with overarching themes, hidden rewards and engaging surprises. In fact, professors from the University of Mary-land have interviewed students from our UF iteration of the HvZ game for their research on designing game narratives in alternate reality games.
In his 2006 paper, “Confronting the Chal-
lenges of Participatory Culture,”  MIT’s Henry Jenkins outlined 11 new media literacy skills students will need to succeed in the 21st cen-tury. These skills include play, performance, simulation, appropriation, multitasking, dis-tributed cognition, collective intelligence, judgment, transmedia navigation, networking and negotiation. I have anecdotally observed UF HvZ play-
ers actively engaging in all of these skills at different times during the game. While further research is needed, it is my suspicion a high level of learning and creation is occurring 
within and around this game. 
Maybe a zombie attack is just what UF 
needs.

Students deserve an apology
Matt Michel and Dana Summerstein both 
wrote letters trashing the Independent Coali-
tion.
Both of them failed to mention they were or 
are high-ranking officials in the Unite Party.
Michel was in the Student Senate for years. 
Summerstein was, at various times, an exter -
nal affairs and public relations director in Stu-dent Government’s Cabinet.
Both Michel and Summerstein might not 
like the Independent Coalition’s message of shaking up SG to make it work for students, and they are entitled to their opinion. 
But the way they attempted to pass them-
selves off as ordinary concerned students when they have a personal connection to the Unite Party is misleading and unethical.
If political hacks want to opine in the pages 
of the Alligator, they owe it to the student body to be upfront about their background.
I think Michel and Summerstein owe an 
apology to the student body for not being straight with us.

Frantzie Saint Juste listened patiently as one 
student after another gave the same response 
— too much homework, not enough time. An-other day at the Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County, another day understaffed. 
If each student at UF volunteered for just 
one hour, what kind of difference could it 
make, she wondered.
The idea for the UF 50K Hours Service 
Challenge was born.
The UF Service Ambassadors in the Center 
for Leadership and Service created the school-wide initiative promoting volunteering among 
students, organizations, faculty and staff. The project aims to encourage 50,000 participants 
at UF to pledge one hour of community ser -
vice from September until April.Saint Juste, the director of Service Ambassa -
dors, said they are working to obtain monetary donations that the participant or organization 
with the most hours can give to a charity of choice. 
“I think a lot of times people feel that they’re 
only one person and they can’t do anything,” she said. “But that’s the worst thing you can do. Small differences create change.”
That’s what leaders of the challenge hope to 
emphasize with their campaign, said Daniella Phillips, social media manager for the project.
Phillips spent about 450 hours in high 
school working as a hospice volunteer. When she arrived at UF, she stopped volunteering 
and fell into the same slump she said many 
students face. 
But now, her work with the project has reju-
venated her desire to volunteer. 
“College years are very selfish years,” she 
said. “I think a lot of people are involved in high school because you’re required to do ser -
vice, but then you come to college and it’s al-most the last thing on your mind.”Service group seeks helpCRIME

A 58-year-old Gainesville 
man was arrested and charged 
with one count of animal cruelty Wednesday for allegedly stabbing 
a neighbor’s rottweiller about 16 
times with a pocketknife.    
On July 21, Thomas Martin Ne-
bus heard a schnauzer, Angel, and 
a neighbor’s dog, Rosco, fighting 
outside Nebus’ home at 4528 SE First Ave.
Nebus is accused of ending the 
fight by repeatedly stabbing Rosco 
with a 3-inch pocketknife, accord-
ing to an Alachua County Animal 
Services investigation report. 
The rottweiler ran away, but 
Nebus pursued and continued to stab him, wounding the dog in the throat, around the lung and on top of the neck, according to the 
report. 
“When [Nebus] decided to fol-
low and continue stabbing the 
dog, that’s what’s viewed as cru-
elty,” said David Flagler, ACAS 
director. 
 “This is the reason people need 
to secure their an-
imals at home.”
Police found 
Rosco bleeding under a bush, and the dog’s owner, 
Victor Heidel-
berg. Heidelberg surrendered him 
to animal services. 
A veterinarian decided Rosco’s 
wounds were too extensive to be treated and euthanized him.  
Nebus was released from jail 
Thursday without bond.Man charged with

Picks 
ColumnALLIGATOR

SITE: The Swamp (cap. 88,548)
KICKOFF: Saturday 7 p.m.
TV/RADIO: ESPNU/WRUF AM850
We hate to bring it up, but we have 
to.
Discussion of an ex is rarely pulled 
off without some awkwardness, and 
we at the alligatorSports Brand Picks 
Column understand this as well as any-
one. 
But we’re a slave to the picks, and 
this week they say we have to dig around in the Gators’ little black book and talk about two of your exes: Steve Spurrier and Cam Newton.
Spurrier and his band of Gamecocks 
may finally be poised to challenge Flor -
ida in the Southeastern Conference East Division, and how No. 12 South Caro-lina fares at No. 17 Auburn this week-end will be a good indicator of whether these ’Cocks can rise to the challenge rather than lay down and play dead.
Newton was once a hopeful succes-
sor to Tim Tebow, but off-field prob-lems and on-field competition with 
John Brantley led to a transfer, and now 
he plies his trade in different shades of orange and blue with the Tigers.
Newton has been slinging the ball 
around like it’s a stolen laptop and running like, well, the police are chas-ing him with questions about a stolen laptop.
It’s a matchup that tugs at a UF fan’s 
heartstrings: Can the Florida legend make good at a lesser program, or will Newton defend his former team’s SEC East honor?
We left it up to a couple of alligator -
Sports columnists to squabble over the game.
Auburn (-3) will cover the spread at 
home because:
Auburn quarterback Cameron New-
ton will steal your cookies and your laptop, Kyle.
Your decision to take Steve Spurrier 
and Stephen Garcia against the Tigers at home is the worst thing to happen to you since that flat you got on the way to Knoxville last weekend. 
Newton is playing well and has       JENKINS WAS SEC 
FRESHMAN OF THE WEEK.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Ahmad Black’s name sat atop 
the Gators box score, and he wasn’t 
exactly pumped.
Through two games, Black led 
the Florida defense with 20 tackles. If the 5-foot-9 safety continued to 
outpace the Gators linebackers, the team was in trouble, Black said.
But Black was limited to just 
four tackles last week. Stepping in 
front of him were redshirt fresh-
man Jelani Jenkins and sophomore 
Jon Bostic, who combined for 14 
tackles as Florida (3-0, 1-0) limited Tennessee to 29 rushing yards.
And Saturday , when No. 9 UF 
hosts Kentucky (3-0, 0-0) at 7 p.m., 
fans will see if the pair of under -
classmen can continue to plug the 
run.
“(The) linebackers played 
great,” Black said of last week’s 
performance. “I look across the board and I was really proud to 
see from one week to the next how much they progressed. I was excit-ed to see the guys up there running 
around.”
Last season, linebackers Ryan 
Stamper, Brandon Spikes and Dustin Doe headed a unit that held 
opponents to 99.8 rushing yards 
per game, good for second-best in 
the Southeastern Conference. 
But with all three exhausting 
their eligibility, Jenkins and Bostic 
were granted little time to replace the veterans. Rivals.com ranked 
both players among the nation’s 
top-five prep linebackers when 
they came to Gainesville in 2009, but neither had started a game be-

Bostic struggled Sept. 11 
against South Florida, taking im-

Bulls rushed for 244 yards. Jen-

nine tackles through the first two games. 
But the two shined last week. 
Bostic led the Gators with eight tackles and ended a potential Vol-
unteers scoring drive with an in-terception in the end zone. Jenkins 
tied for second on the team with six 
tackles and a sack, a showing good 
enough to earn him SEC Freshman 
of the Week honors.

UF sophomore linebacker Jon Bostic led the team with eight tackles against Tennessee. He has two interceptions this season.
Young linebackers flashing potential
While I was in New York for the sum-
mer covering the Mets, I met a nice 
guy who went to Miami for college 
and currently works for the Wall Street Jour -
nal. 
Needless to say, we were extremely excit-
ed to have found another human being to talk 
Gators and Hurricanes with because college 
football is about as popular in the Northeast as Ron Zook is in Gainesville. 
One of our first exchanges went something 
like this:
“You’re not one of those SEC homers are 
you?” he asked me. 
“Not exactly sure what you mean,” I said. “Like one of those people who thinks the 
SEC is so much better than any other confer -
ence in the country,” he clarified. “Oh. Yeah. I’m ab-
solutely one of those people. The SEC is 
the best conference in 
America year-in and 
year-out. The last four 
BCS Championships 
have been won by SEC 
schools. I don’t really think it’s up for de-
bate,” I answered. 
“I hate people like you,” he said unapolo-
getically. 
The exchange didn’t offend me. It’s not 
wise to write about sports for a career and 
take it personally when someone informs you 
that they disagree wholeheartedly with your 
opinions. It happens all the time. But I was surprised at how genuinely he 
didn’t like people who hold the SEC in such high regard. I didn’t really understand it — 
until last weekend. 
I was having a conversation with another 
friend about Tennessee’s chances of beating 
Florida when he busted out this logistical 
nightmare of a declaration:
“The Vols might be bad this year, but it’s 
still Tennessee and it’s still the SEC.”
As if the mere fact that the UT players ran 
out onto the field with Tennessee across their chests somehow made up for any deficiencies 
they had as, you know, actual football play-
ers. 
This thinking drives me nuts, and I final-
ly understood why my new friend from the SEC fans blinded by their own championship ringsSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 15

Do I think South Carolina is legitimately going to win? Ab-
solutely. But more importantly, that team deserves our support after losing a member of their extended family. 
It makes me sick just thinking about Chiang sitting in front 
of his TV , cheering on Auburn and taking joy in the suffering of others. Quite frankly, it’s un-American. We need to rally around South Carolina at a time like this.

Now on to the picks!
In first place with an 18-10 record is The Gainesville Sun’s 
Edward “Stay Alive. Don’t Text and Drive!” Aschoff, who will do anything Dexter McCluster tells him. So when he’s on the road, he won’t LOL. Nah, he’ll keep both hands on the wheel. This is not a game, and not really a test, Edward, cuz in the blink of an eye it can be your last breath.
Tied for first is alligatorSportsAssistant Editor Tyler “I bring 
my own bed” Jett, who refused to step within five feet of the rest of the sports staff after midnight last weekend when we all shared a hotel room in Knoxville, Tenn. Instead he brought his 
own setup. He might as well have put up caution tape around 
his sleeping spot.
Coming in at third with a 17-11 record is Alligator football 
writer Kyle “Super-SUPER Star” Maistri, who doesn’t care about the actual rap in his rap music. For Kyle, it’s all about the shout outs like “The Empire,” “No Ceilings!” and “It’s Mr. Thanksgiving!”
Also in second is Gatorbait.net’s Keith “You young boys 
better please me” Niebuhr, who punished the University of 
Pittsburgh football players by putting them on “Niebuhr pro-
bation” after they crapped the bed against Miami on Thursday night. As for John Brantley, Keith has put you on notice, sir.
In fifth with a record of 16-12 is the Miami Herald’s Joe “I 
want to be taken seriously, but not THAT seriously” Goodman, whose power suit was complimented by a pair of Chuck Tay-lors at last weekend’s game. That’s the clothes-equivalent of a mullet, Joe. Business from the ankles-up, party on the feet.
Coming in at sixth with a 15-13 record is alligatorSports 
Editor Anthony “Blood” Chiang, who was once asked in high school if he would be “down to gangbang” after listening to “Back Then” by Mike Jones on his cell phone while rocking a bandana to a Miami-area bowling alley . 
And in one half of a tie for dead-ass last place with a piss-
poor record of 14-14 is Alligator football writer Mike “I just don’t want any splash back” McCall, whose sex-related inqui-
ries were far too advanced for the rest of the staff. Save those 
questions for when you get backstage passes to an R. Kelly con-cert, bro.
And it wouldn’t be a picks column without Mr. “Dead-ass 
last place” himself, FightinGators.com’s Cody “Wait, there’s 
a Taco Bell AND a McDonald’s?” Jones, whose initial disap-
pointment about staying in Sweetwater, Tenn., last weekend subsided when he realized the city provided him with two ways to raise his cholesterol.

“I’m starting to slowly figure it out 
now, but I don’t know exactly how long 
it’s going to take to really-really figure it out,” Jenkins said. “I’m starting to feel 
more comfortable.”
While both linebackers made more 
plays against Tennessee, defensive co-
ordinator Teryl Austin said their devel-opment remains a work in progress. In 
particular, he said Bostic needs to become 
the heart of the defense, pointing to how 
Spikes led the unit last season.
Like Spikes, Bostic can change a team’s 
momentum with a forceful tackle, Aus-
tin said. Still, he is not making those hits 
enough, and the coaches are letting him 
know during practice.“He’s a thumper. When he hits you, 
he hits you,” Austin said. “He has to play well and have a presence because it makes 
a difference for your defense.”
Meyer going for 100: Urban Meyer 
will become the sixth-fast-
est college football coach to win 100 career games with 
a victory Saturday against 
Kentucky . The win would 
give him a 100-18 record 
in his 10-year career as a 
head coach.  
He has downplayed the potential mile-
stone, though.
“I’m more into the people than the 
wins,” Meyer said. “I remember so many 
of the great efforts and have been blessed 
to have had so many great players.”   Meyer could become sixth-fast-
est coach to reach 100 wins
FOOTBALL , from page 14Wall Street Journal harbors a small degree 
of ill will for all those “SEC homers” out 
there. 
If anyone in the SEC can beat anyone 
else in the SEC on any given Saturday of 
any given season, then someone please 
explain to me why Florida has beat Ken-tucky 23 years in a row?
Or why Tennessee has beaten Kentucky 
25 years in a row?
Those two streaks, by the way, are the 
longest and second-longest in the FBS.
So maybe any SEC team except Ken-
tucky can beat any other SEC team on any given Saturday of any given season?
Consider this: UF has lost exactly two 
games to SEC East opponents since Urban Meyer took over in 2005 — South Carolina 
in 2005 and Georgia in 2007. 
And don’t even get me started on Van-
derbilt, which has gone winless in confer -
ence play five different times since 1996. 
(They’ve had five other one-win seasons 
in that same time period.)
So once again, let’s amend our working 
hypothesis: Any SEC team except Ken-tucky and Vanderbilt can beat any other SEC team on any given Saturday of any given season, unless of course you’re an 
SEC East team trying to beat Florida in the 
Urban Meyer era.
If any Gators fans felt nervous about 
beating Tennessee for the sixth consecu -
tive year last Saturday or feel nervous 
about handling Kentucky for the 24th straight time this Saturday, it should have 
nothing to do with the fact that the Vols 
and ‘Cats are SEC teams. 
It should have everything to do with 
the fact that this Florida team isn’t as good as they have been in the last few seasons. 
UF has the third-fewest total yards of 
offense (952) of any team in the top 25. By 
comparison, Michigan quarterback Den-
ard Robinson has accounted for 1,230 total 
yards of offense by himself. 
Facts like that make me unsure of the 
Gators’ weekly fate no matter who they line up against this season, not some mis-
conception that the SEC is akin to some 
ongoing game of rock, paper, scissors 
where all the teams circularly defeat each 
other every season. 
If Florida loses on Saturday, it will be a 
historical anomaly, not a representation of 
the SEC’s superior depth.KYLE , from page 14  AC   TJ   KM  MM

Although they’ve already played eight 
ranked opponents, the most important part 
of the Gators volleyball season is just getting started. 
Everything prior to last Friday’s South-
eastern Conference opener was just a learning experience for No. 3 Florida (9-1, 2-0 SEC), which will look to put those lessons to use when it takes on Mississippi (8-3, 2-0 SEC) Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
“We’ve always looked at the pre-confer -
ence matches as an opportunity to get better and prepare for the SEC,” coach Mary Wise 
said. “There are many things that were evi-
dent that we need to get better at, and when you play good teams that’s when you’ll see them exposed.”
Although Wise cited consistent sideout 
and transition play as areas that could use some improvement, she opted to give the players a hard-earned day off from practice Thursday . 
The break was the team’s first since Sept. 
13, as the Gators won road matches against No. 22 Kentucky, No. 18 Tennessee and No. 13 Florida State in a six-day stretch. 
“I think the players physically and mental-
ly were overdue for a day off from practice,” Wise said. “Hopefully they can get caught up academically and rest before we get back at it 
on Friday.”
Despite playing three consecutive road 
matches against ranked opponents for the 
first time in program history, the team never showed any signs of exhaustion. 
In their third set against the Seminoles on 
Wednesday night—the 11th set of the road trip—the Gators were as sharp as ever, hitting .485 as a team. 
“It was a hard fought and intense battle, 
but the players never looked fatigued,” Wise said. “And fatigue doesn’t always have to be physical because playing on the road can take a toll on you mentally.”
Sunday’s match begins a stretch of three 
straight at home for the Gators, which do not play another away contest until they travel to Alabama on Oct. 8. 
Their next road match against a currently 
— ranked opponent is not until Nov. 21, when they take on LSU in the penultimate match of the regular season. 
Still, the team knows that every match in 
the SEC can present a challenge. “There is absolutely no such thing as a 
run-of-the-mill match in the SEC,” Wise said. 
“Every single team in the league is capable of win-ning it because there are so many players on so many good teams.”
“Ole Miss has one of 
the most athletic teams 
they’ve ever had, and we know they’re going to play hard.”
UF soccer team to face Kentucky tonightThe Gators are about to start their South-
eastern Conference season, but the toughest stretch of the 2010 campaign may already be behind them.
Florida went 1-1-1 the past two weeks 
against No. 1 North Carolina, No. 13 Florida State and No. 14 Duke.
“As far as the competition, this is exactly 
what we wanted heading into the SEC,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
The No. 7 Gators (6-1-1) will be able to 
measure just how much that stiff early-season competition has paid off tonight at 7, when they travel to Kentucky (6-2). UF will then 
travel to Vanderbilt on Sunday.
“Both teams are really tough at home and we seem to play a lot of overtime games with 
them on the road,” Burleigh said. “This week-end we expect two teams who are trying to start off well in the SEC like we are.”
UF is 12-2-1 all time in SEC openers and 
3-2 in SEC openers on the road. 
Florida has won the past four SEC cham-
pionships, and league coaches picked the Gators to repeat again this season.
In Florida’s last two meetings with Ken-
tucky , the Gators defeated the Wildcats in overtime. Junior Lindsay Thompson scored the golden goal in both matches.
“The most important thing for us is to take 
all the experience we have gained in the non-conference portion of the season and apply that to this weekend,” Burleigh said.
As the Gators enter the middle of the sea-
son they are still trying to find their identity . Florida generates good offensive play through the consistency of the team’s defense, which pressures opponents in their own territory and causes turnovers.
“Since we have numbers, there are a lot of 
options to play short and keep possession,” Burleigh said. “The hardest part for us is to make sure that we are really intense on de-fense and have high energy.”
