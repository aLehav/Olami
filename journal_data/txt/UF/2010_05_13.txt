ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A Massa-
chusetts woman pleaded guilty to imperson-
ating an FBI agent after fooling her former neighbors in northern Virginia into taking jobs as her assistant. 
Twenty-nine-year-old Brenna Reilly of 
Holyoke, Mass., was living in Arlington last year and told neighbors she was the FBI's di-rector of forensics. 
Two neighbors agreed to work as Reilly's 
assistant. She gave them tasks that included writing condolence letters to family mem-bers of slain agents. But Reilly was never an FBI agent, the jobs were phony and the as-sistants were never paid.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for the U.S. At-
torney in the Eastern District of Virginia, said it remains unclear why Reilly conduct-ed the hoax.
Following Tuesday's guilty plea, Reilly 
faces up to three years in prison.

UF professor Mary Robison 
turned her short stories into tall 
stacks of cash.  
Robison recently received the 
prestigious Rea Award for the 
Short Story along with $30,000. 
The award is given annually by 
a panel of three judges and is spon-
sored by the Dungannon Founda-tion. It goes to authors who have made a significant contribution to 
the short story as an art form, ac-
cording to the award’s website.
Robison, who has focused pri-
marily on novel writing as of late, did not expect to receive the award 
because she had not written a short 
story in some time.“I couldn’t have been more sur-
prised,” Robison said. “I hadn’t 
written a short story in a while. I 
thought it was a mistake.” 
She was also surprised by the 
prize money. 
“There was some mention of 
getting my address to send me a 
check,” she said. “I said ‘Oh God, 
there’s money involved?’ They told 
me, ‘Yes, in fact, there’s $30,000.’”
Robison has been referred to as a minimalist author, though she is 
hesitant to label herself as such.
“[Minimalist] sounds to me like 
you haven’t worked very hard,” 
she said. “It sounds like you’re do-
ing the minimum. It’s more about 
selection and choosing exactly the 
bits of description you need in the 
story.” 
Over the course of her career, 
Robison has published four short-story collections: “Days,” “An 
Amateur’s Guide to the Night,” “Believe Them,” and “Tell Me: 30 
Stories.”
Some of her short stories were 
originally published in The New Yorker, The Paris Review, Esquire, 
GQ and Harvard Magazine.
Robison has also published four 
novels, including “Why Did I Ever” 
and the critically acclaimed “One 
D.O.A., One on the Way,” which 
was featured on Oprah Winfrey’s 
2009 summer reading list. Professor wins $30,000

The first Senate meeting of the 
summer semester saw the ap-
proval of 53 new Cabinet mem-
bers, ranging from agency chairs to presidential advisers.
Student Body President Ash-
ton Charles touted the qualifica-
tions of each of the 53 candidates, 
all of whom were eventually approved. A Q-and-A session, which sometimes resembled a 
debate, preceded the vote for 
each candidate.
The Senate approved Zack Goldstein as the new chairman 
for Accent Speakers Bureau, but 
not without 15 minutes of discus-sion over the issue of access to VIP tickets for Accent-sponsored 
events.
VIP tickets 
to Accent-spon-sored events are made available to senators and 
Accent staffers 
on a first-come, first-serve ba-

UF professor� YEARLONG LEASES KEEP BUILDINGS OCCUPIED 
DURING SUMMER MONTHS.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Contributing Writer
The students may be out of town, but apartment own-
ers aren’t worried.
Because most local apartments require that tenants 
sign one-year leases, which includes the summer se-
mester, area apartment owners are not 
concerned about finding tenants for the 
summer, said Andres Tinoco, a leasing 
and marketing manager for University Commons. 
Furthermore, despite a decreased enrollment at UF, 
the overall vacancy rate for area apartments is trending 
downward. 
The apartment vacancy rate in March, the last month 
of available data, was 11.9 percent, down from last year’s 
13 percent.

Republican Party sells 
Crist portrait for $7,700 
TALLAHASSEE — The 
Florida Republican Party can’t 
seem to get over being jilted 
by Gov. Charlie Crist.
The party said Wednesday 
it’s sold an oil painting of 
Crist for $7,700 on eBay. 
Spokeswoman Katie Betta 
said the buyer was a regis-tered Florida Republican who wanted to remain anony-mous.
In a letter to members, the 
party sought donations to help “move forward from the sordid legacy of Charlie Crist 
and Jim Greer,” the former 
party chairman.
By surrendering his party 
registration to run without af-filiation in his bid for the U.S. 
Senate, Crist created a three-
way race in November when he’ll likely face the new dar-ling of Florida Republicans, 
former House Speaker Marco 
Rubio, and the Democratic nominee. U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek is the front-runner.

ST. PETERSBURG — Calling it 
a “no-brainer,” Gov. Charlie Crist 
stopped into the elections office in his hometown Wednesday to offi-cially declare his political indepen-dence.
Greeted by a gaggle of reporters 
and TV cameras, Crist sat down and signed documents changing his sta-tus on the voter rolls from “Repub-lican” to “none.” It reflects his deci-
sion to run for the U.S. Senate as an 
independent after polls showed him falling far behind Marco Rubio in 
the race for the GOP nomination.
“It’s very liberating,” the always 
ebullient governor said afterward. 
“For me it was a no-brainer. It was just the right thing to do.”
By leaving the Republican Par-
ty, Crist now must wage a war on two fronts against Rubio and likely Democratic nominee Kendrick.� CENTER’S DESIGN AIMS

UF President Bernie Machen and 
other UF officials dedicated the Bio-
medical Sciences Building  Tuesday. 
The building’s innovative design 
is intended to encourage scientists of 
different colleges to work in teams, according to a UF press release.    
The building’s work spaces are 
mostly open and lack the confined offices that characterize most labo-ratories. The building’s labs feature 
large windows that are supposed to 
make the environment more well-lit and comfortable.    
Aside from promoting shared 
space, the open design is also ex-
pected to encourage the sharing of 
ideas, according to a press release. 
The facility, which was complet-
ed in October after about three years 
of construction, will house research centers and programs such as the UF Diabetes Center of Excellence, the Center for Translational Research in Neurodegenerative Disease and the Rehabilitation Research Program.
The $90.5-million, eight-story 
building is located on the northeast corner of Center Drive and Mowry 
Road. 4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010

About seven years after graduation, one UF alumna is master-
ing the art of professional social networking.
The National Society of Collegiate Scholars named Jamie 
Nacht Farrell as the society’s most active alumna on Brazen Ca-
reerist, a social networking tool.
Brazen Careerist is based on a feed of top ideas, similar to 
Facebook’s news feed, that employers peruse before hiring, said Janine Deegan, a communications coordinator for Brazen Ca-
reerist.
The award is a $1,500 scholarship that Farrell said she will 
use to become certified in Six Sigma, a management tool de-
signed to increase corporate efficiency.
Farrell is an executive marketer for higher education compa-
nies, and she receives two to three six-figure-salary job offers a week, she said.
Farrell, who graduated from UF in 2003 with degrees in psy-
chology and education, attributes the job offers to social net-
working. In particular, she said her presence on LinkedIn, an-
other professional social networking tool that focuses on sharing job experiences and online resumes, has been helpful.
“Probably the best thing I did was that I got heavily involved 
in LinkedIn right after I graduated,” said Farrell, who owns a home in Palm Beach and lives in Dal-las. “For anyone in college, LinkedIn has by far been the most helpful in networking and social me-
dia.”
Brazen Careerist is a good tool for people between the ages of 
25 and 40, Farrell said.
She won the award on Brazen Careerist because she used a 
number of different social media tools to connect with people on the website.
“She was the most active person, using the most tools to con-
nect with people,” said Deegan. “She got a lot of people into the group. She used a blog, Twitter and other social media. She did a lot to get people buzzing.”
The award was created to encourage graduates of the National 
Society of Collegiate Scholars program to connect with each oth-er and create professional relationships, said Deegan.
“Brazen Careerist allows people to be more than a resume,” 
Deegan said. “It lets employers hire them for their ideas more than work experience.”UF alumna wins

BULLET REMAINS IN LOWER BACK.

A suspect was arrested Tuesday in con-
nection to a recent shooting of a Gainesville 
man who remains in recovery.
Anton Watson, 30, is being charged with 
armed burglary and attempted murder, ac-cording to a Gainesville Police report. Bail is set at $200,000. 
At 11:25 p.m. on April 1, police responded 
to a call that someone had been shot at Sher-wood Apartments, 3557 SW 19th Ave. Of-ficers found Farouk Kamma II being loaded into an ambulance to be treated for a gunshot 
wound, the report stated.
Kamma later told police he had been in his 
home with his girlfriend and their son when 
someone knocked on the door asking for a 
girl named Shaunda, the report stated.Kamma told the man there was no one in-
side by that name, but a second man came up and put a semi-automatic handgun in Kam-
ma’s face, according to the report.
Kamma said he was shot through his door 
as he pushed against it to keep the two men from forcing their way inside. The bullet 
pierced his right armpit and remains lodged 
in his lower back, the report stated.
During police interviews, Kamma said he 
thought he recognized one of 
the men from high school, and 
named Watson as a suspect. He then identified him in a picture 
lineup, the report stated.
Watson was arrested by GPD and, after 
being read his rights, admitted to having been at Kamma’s apartment that night. 
He said while he was there, two men did 
threaten Kamma at gunpoint. But Watson de-
nied being one of them, although he gave no 
reason for failing to report the crime sooner, the report stated.Man arrested in shooting

TAMPA— After trying and failing 
— twice — to land the Republican Na-
tional Convention in this Gulf Coast city, a group of community leaders and GOP insiders finally succeeded Wednesday 
afternoon.
“We are very proud to call and tell you 
that Tampa is the host city,” Republican 
National Committee chairman Michael Steele said during a conference call.
Cheers and ear-to-ear grins filled a 
Tampa conference room, located on the 21st floor of a downtown high rise.
“We are looking forward to working 
with you,” Al Austin, the host committee chairman, told Steele on the phone. “We are going to hit the road running tomor-row and start the fundraising. We look forward to this fantastic opportunity.”
A Republican National Committee 
panel recommended Tampa during a closed-door meeting, rejecting Salt Lake City and Phoenix. The decision came 
amid calls from Hispanic groups and oth-
ers to boycott Arizona after it adopted a law to crack down on illegal immigrants — although Steele insisted that the Ari-zona immigration uproar played no part in the convention choice. He said it was “purely a business decision.”
Seth Masket, a political science profes-
sor at the University of Denver, blogged about his experience during the 2008 Democratic National Convention, and said Tampa Bay residents are in for a good time.
“It’s a very exciting time for a city,” 
he said.
Worries about traffic and security in 
Denver never really became reality, said Masket, and some folks made money by renting out their apartments and homes and leaving town.
“You can do pretty well for yourself, 
renting out your home,” he said. “I don’t know how many hotel rooms Tampa has available, but they will be eaten up pretty quickly.”STATE

Tea Party is a few cards 
short of full deck
We thought plans for 
a fire assessment fee died years ago, but the Alachua County Commission is pull-ing out the Jaws of Life to try and make its recent version of this terrible idea a reality.
Unlike property taxes, 
which are calculated based on the assessed value of a building, the proposed as-sessment is a “per-dwelling” fee – a catchall that would include apartments – calcu-lated based on the size of a building and whether it’s in an urban or rural area.
Homeowners living in 
unincorporated Alachua County could end up paying more than $200 a year for the fee, regardless of the value of their homes. This would decrease taxes on high-value homes while increasing them for lower-value homes.For such a progressive county, it sounds like a regressive tax.
The county says the as-
sessment would raise about $8 million every year, but it is unlikely that fire services would see a budget increase. When the city considered a $30-per-house fire assess-ment fee in 2008, it was clear it was just trying to free up general fund money for Gainesville Police Depart-ment.
If we knew this money 
would ensure firefighters would get the best equip-ment and training then we 
might grin and bear it, but 
we don’t think this is the case. We understand it costs money to put out fires, and the last thing we want to see is underfunded first re-sponders. But this assess-ment sticks the bill with the wrong people, and we want to see it go up in smoke.Just  when we thought the Tea Party movement could 
not get any more ridiculous, one company has started selling its own take on the Iraqi Most Wanted Playing 
Cards, except they feature politicians.
 The company, Shenandoah Valley Tea Party Pa-
triots Inc., claims the politicians in the 54-card deck are the “most dangerous progressives in Washington who are up 
for re-election” and encourages local tea parties to buy the 
cards so they can sell them at rallies.
 The deck features eight Republicans and 46 Dem-
ocrats, with John McCain as the ace of spades and Nancy Pelosi as the joker. The company suggests that people 
should mail their cards to the politicians with a message 
saying they will be calling their bluff on election day.
Most of those letters will probably be met with little more 
than an eye roll before being promptly thrown in the garbage 
by congressional interns, but it would not be the Tea Party if 
they did not throw in a couple of cheap shots.
 We can’t help but notice the prejudiced under-
current. Barney Frank, a prominent and openly gay rep-
resentative from Massachusetts, is portrayed as the deck’s queen of hearts. It is this kind of immature behavior that makes the entire movement seem more like poorly veiled 
hate than legitimate politics. It has to stop.
 The political divide in America is hitting an all-
time high, and it baffles us that this is considered accept-
able. While the Tea Party claims to be grassroots with 
members from all political parties, all we ever see are peo-
ple holding up racist signs and calling people names. 
As someone who is fascinated by the U.S. Supreme 
Court, I’ve been consuming every bit of informa-tion about President Obama’s recent nominee, Elena 
Kagan. Unfortunately, it seems as if the Alligator’s Editorial Board has not consumed even half of that information.
Tuesday’s editorial, “Poor Judgment,” displayed poor 
judgment questioning Kagan’s nomination on unsubstantial grounds and misrepresented what little facts that were cited. The main complaint seemed to be that Kagan “has no experi-ence as a judge, federal or otherwise.” 
Perhaps it would have been helpful to mention that for-
mer President Bill Clinton nominated Kagan for a federal judgeship in 1999. Her nomination was stalled by a Repub-lican-controlled Congress that did what every partisan Con-
gress does when a president of the opposite party is nearing 
the end of his term: delay voting on a court nomination in the hopes that its party will win the White House and then nominate someone with its ideological views. Kagan’s nomi-nation was not rejected. It died out because a president’s unconfirmed nominations expire at the end of the presiden-tial term. Because the next president was a Republican, pre-sumably Kagan would not be nominated for another federal judgeship, so she pursued another legal career path.
Ultimately, what the writer failed to understand is that 
Kagan’s lack of experience as a judge is not the end of the 
world. In addition to former Chief Justice Earl Warren, more 
than one-third of all Supreme Court justices, including the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, did not serve as judges before joining our nation’s highest court. In fact, Kagan’s experience as solicitor general is actually more applicable to serving as a Supreme Court justice than most judgeships. The solicitor general represents the U.S. government in up to two-thirds of all Supreme Court cases each year. As such, the solicitor general has more experience with the Supreme 
Court and insight into its decision-making process than most 
judges at any level, aside from the Supreme Court justices themselves. In fact, the solicitor general is often referred to as “the 10th justice.” True, Kagan has served in this position for a little more than a year, but in that year she has held her own in oral argu-
ments against the court’s fiercest justice, Antonin Scalia—a 
feat that should not be minimized.
The Editorial Board’s characterization of former President 
Eisenhower’s comment about the late Chief Justice Earl War-
ren was also irresponsible and misleading. Eisenhower said appointing Warren was the “biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made” not because Warren simply shifted the court’s politics but because Warren shifted the court in a liberal di-rection that Eisenhower—a Republican—disagreed with. We would expect a Democratic president to feel the same way 
had he or she selected Chief Justice John Roberts and Associ-
ate Justice Samuel Alito, given that these two conservatives have facilitated a massive rightward shift in their four years on the court. 
Furthermore, the writer’s concern that “[t]he last thing the 
court needs is an unknown quantity shaking up the system” is quite an exaggeration. That line makes Kagan sound like a radical extremist yearning to burst free from her current mold. You know, the mold she’s been in for the past 50 years, just waiting until she has that chance to be nominated to the Supreme Court and then she can do whatever her radical 
heart desires. 
It’s fine to raise legitimate questions about how many 
cases Kagan might have to recuse herself from given her 
position as solicitor general, or to ponder the implications of having an Ivy League-educated court when most Americans don’t attend Ivy League schools. But the questions this edi-torial raised about Kagan’s experience were unfounded and presented without context. Because most student readers probably use the Alligator as their only news source, the edi-
torial did the university community a significant disservice.

Student criticizes Southwest 
Recreation Center security
I wanted to let the Alligator know 
how Southwest Recreation Center is 
keeping students’ personal belong-ings safe.
I just had my wallet stolen out 
of my locker this afternoon. You’re probably wondering how someone gets a wallet stolen out of a locked-locker. 
Well, the gym is providing mem-
bers with locks and keys that have duplicates. In the past semester, I have, on accident, opened at least two locks that did not belong to me 
with my own issued key. I quickly 
realized these weren’t my belongings and locked it back up. I remembered thinking to myself that this could be-come a problem if the gym did not fix the issue. Unfortunately, it seems that I am the first victim. I came back after working out and found that my wallet, which was inside the locker on top of my backpack, was now missing, although my cell phone and keys were spared. I am 100 percent positive my wallet was in the locker because I had just put my Gator 1 Card back in it after renting the lock.  I asked to speak to a supervisor, and I was told, “Thefts happen, and it is not Southwest’s responsibility.”
After filing a police report, I was 
told the same thing. This drives me crazy because it completely defeats the purpose of providing locks to safeguard your belongings if other students have access to the lock. I am now missing my driver’s license, two credit cards, my Social Security card, AAA card, health insurance card and 
$37, all because of Southwest’s negli-
gence. You can rest assured that I will be bringing my own lock from now on, however I thought the rest of UF should know about the crummy locker system.

Letter to the Editor
Debate is important. Especially when it 
comes to something as vital as health care. But when it comes to debate, as one sena-
tor put it, “You are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts.”
Bryan Griffin’s Tuesday column was long 
on opinion, but misleading on facts. First of all, Democrats agree with Griffin’s focus on efficien-cy. It’s humorous, though, that this point came after an entire column whining about the role of government. It may be Griffin’s opinion that government isn’t efficient, but it’s a fact that the government’s track record on efficiency is excel-lent. In fact, government is the most efficient dis-
burser of benefits in the United States. Medicare 
and Social Security overhead costs are a minus-cule portion of their total cost. Private insurance overhead is three times as much.
Implying that private charity will replace the 
billions of dollars in support that government provides for children, the elderly and the disad-vantaged is ridiculous. To then go on to say that these programs are inefficient is equally ridicu-
lous. They may not turn a profit for a corpora-
tion, but that’s not their intention. They provide the assistance they were created to provide.
Shoehorned into this column about “effi-
ciency” is the complaint that healthy people are mandated by the recent health care legislation to buy insurance. This entire anti-mandate argument highlights a split that I’ve 
noticed recently between the Democratic and Re-publican parties: Democrats like the mandate be-cause it provides help for the people who need it, because it’s constitutional and because it works. Republicans don’t like it because it was proposed by Democrats and because they need to moan about the “unconstitutional” bill from now until November. Ask Bill McCollum, Republican can-didate for governor right here in Florida, how his 
lawsuit to overturn health care reform is going in 
courts (hint: not far).
Democrats understand that we’re not being 
forced to choose between private charity and government assistance. There is a place for both, and both are essential to a healthy society. But it’s simply untrue to say that government is inef-ficient, and it’s simply untrue to say that Demo-crats support government programs to help 
people just for kicks. When we see a problem, we 
set out to solve it, and sometimes that solution includes the government.
Nicholas Mildebrath is the editorial chair of Col-
lege Democrats. Government spends efficientlyGuest column
This week, the director of the Congressional Budget Of-fice announced the health care legislation is going to cost about $115 billion more than expected. This brings the 
total in health care spending up to about $1 trillion — so far.
I have a pet skunk. His name is Odysseus. He is 4 years old 
and was rescued from an exotic pet store. He is a creature of little action who knows what is necessary and what isn’t. He would make the perfect modern legislator.
 The added $115 billion to the already hefty price tag 
for health care reform should come as no shock to anyone. I bet living under our government would be far less expensive if we replaced many of the spend-happy politicians in Wash-ington with pet skunks. Just imagine: It  wouldn’t cost America trillions of dollars to satisfy politicians’ egos with “legacy, landmark legislature,” but only 
about $40 a month in vegetables and the occasional peanut. 
Unfortunately, politicians aren’t so easily satisfied. Instead, the 
modern politician desires giant spending projects that only glo-rify their own time with little concern for cost or practicality.
 They should be looking out for America’s best in-
terests—including financial interests. We are now witnessing in Europe what happens when governments run out of other people’s money to borrow and spend. Our federal deficit last month was four times higher than it was in April 2009. We are headed in the wrong direction. We are different from Greece in degree, but not in kind. 
Congress needs to act more concerned with the interest of 
the public than with its own agenda. Seeing as how our gov-
ernment has no interest in implementing free-market strategies 
to accomplish goals, I see little immediate hope for a reduction in the bill Congress is racking up.
 So: Odysseus for Congress in 2012! While many mod-
ern legislators see “protecting our financial interests” as a gray area, with Odysseus, it’s all black and white.

Speaking Out62nd Blvd., does not have a problem 
with vacancies. Until December, it was at 
100 percent capacity, said Rob Wright, a 
property manager at the apartment com-plex. Wright added that since December, 
the Woodlands has only had a few empty 
units remain.
“We’ve had a handful of vacancies that 
have come to us, so it’s not a problem,” Wright said. “We go on campus and pro-mote the apartments. We know that a lot of transfers come in Summer A.”
University Commons, located at 2601 
SW Archer Road, is also successfully get-
ting people to sign leases.
Some apartment managers are us-
ing financial incentives to attract tenants. University Commons, for instance, takes 
10 percent off the lease price if the renter signs within 24 hours of coming in and 
pays by the first of every month, Tinoco 
said. Other apartments offer special rates specifically for the summer months.“A lot of students will take into that,” 
Tinoco said. “It entices a lot of students.”
University Commons has filled most 
of its units  because students mostly sign 
one-year leases, Tinoco said.
“We have a lot of peo-
ple looking for sublets,” he said. “They’re trying 
to find people to fill their 
spots. The units are mostly filled up from 
the previous year of leasing.”
The Woodlands of Gainesville attempts 
to attract incoming freshmen by passing out promotional material during orienta-
tions, Wright said.
University Commons preemptively re-
cruits new tenants by visiting local  high 
schools that have good relationships with 
the university, Tinoco said.
“Nowadays, the savvier people are go-
ing to the Internet. People aren’t going to pick up a newspaper the way they used to,” Tinoco said. “People Google ‘Gainesville 
apartment.’ We are going to the Internet to 
get those people.”8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010

Providence and Worcester Railroad freight train came off the track. No injuries were reported.
Members debate VIP 
Accent event tickets
Student Alliance Sen. Alan Yanuck, representative for 
the Keys Residential Complex, pressed Goldstein about 
the issue of fairness.
“Many of the people who voted for me have said that 
these tickets are not a good idea,” Yanuck said. “No stu-
dents are more important than any other students.”
Safety was Goldstein’s primary concern. “Knowing who’s sitting closest to the speaker helps 
us,” he said.
Although security has always been a concern, U.S. Sen. 
John Kerry’s 2007 appearance at UF, during which a UF 
student was Tasered by university police, underscored 
event organizers’  need to know who is sitting close to the 
speakers, Goldstein said.
Kyle Calhoun, newly appointed Student Government 
Productions chair, proposed the creation of an Accent and SGP fan club that would hold a lottery for members to win the VIP tickets.
Calhoun said he would meet with lottery winners be-
fore the event to screen potentially dangerous guests.
In addition to approving Cabinet appointments and 
arguing about VIP tickets, the Senate passed a resolution honoring Thomas Hollister, a UF electrical engineering student who was recently killed when a tree fell on his car while driving in the Panhandle.SENATE , from page 1

Dust off your morals and pray for calamity. 
Ellis Amburn, former editor to the stars and au -
thor of seven biographies, is just one of the 30 
writers coming to a workshop at the UF. 
“You must be spiritually connected with a 
power greater than you to have a theme and a set of moral values against which to judge experience,” he said. “Calamity makes you eli-gible for a spiritual experience.”
 Weimer Hall will be echoing with the voices 
of five Pulitzer Prize winners and 10 UF alumni Friday to Sunday at The Storytellers’ Summit. A welcome reception at 6 p.m. in Ustler Hall kicks off the summit Friday at 6 p.m. in Ustler Hall. 
“Because of the economic problems around 
the United States, the newspapers and others who sponsor writers’ workshops have been dropping out,” journalism professor Mike Foley said. He decided to team up with William Mc-Keen, UF department of journalism professor and chairman, to start the summit. “It turned out to be a pretty impressive ar -
ray,” he said. 
Michael Connelly, best-selling crime author 
and UF alumnus, Rick Bragg, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of “Somebody Told Me,” and Roy Peter Clark, director of The Poynter In-stitute, will be speaking at the summit, among others. 
“Even those 
without Pulitzer Prizes are terrific writers,” Foley said. “They are also will-ing to share their 
success in terms 
of how they learned 
to write, and all of them, as I know, are really good at it.” 
After 20 years in the editing business, Am-
burn was attracting the bestsellers from Hol-lywood. 
Amburn credits the success of his books to 
his moral values and spiritual connection with a higher power. Both of which he said came to him late in life. 
The two-day summit features book sign-
ings, storytelling sessions and group sessions. Topics at each session range from visual sto -
rytelling to writing gonzo biographies. A cock -
tail and networking reception is scheduled for Saturday. 
Amburn will be speaking Saturday about 
his transition from editor to author, his experiences editing Jack Kerouac’s last two books and writ-ing about Roy Or -
bison, Buddy Holly 
and others. 
He attributed 
his transition from 
editor to author to 
his work ghostwriting for Shelley Winters and Priscilla Presley. After completing “Elvis and Me” with Presley and “Shelley: Also Known as Shirley” with Winters, Amburn left editing to work on “Shelley II: The Middle of my Cen-tury.”   “I evolved by chance and destiny,” he 
said. 
He has been the ghost writer for a multi-
tude of celebrities and written seven biogra-phies, one of which he wrote under a pseud -
onym. Amburn, who lives in High Springs, is currently working on a biography of Tim Tebow titled “Finish Strong.” The book is scheduled for release in a year and a half, Amburn said. 
Although Amburn said writing a book isn’t 
as hard as people think, he does offer some advice to students. “Your true style is in the letter you write your mother,” he said. 
General registration is $160 for both days, 
$80 per day. Registration for students and 
educators is $60. Department of journalism 
students and faculty can attend for free. For more information regarding registration or to download the schedule, visit www.jou.ufl.edu/storytellers. 
Mike Foley, former editor of The St. Peters-
burg Times, said he hopes attendees, esti-mated at around 150 people, will leave with a value for the art of storytelling. “I think it is the salvation of journalism,” he said.
“Because of the economic 
problems around the United States, the newspapers and others who sponsor writers’ workshops have been dropping out.”

 Until ObamaCare ofﬁ  cially kicks 
in, basic body maintenance can be 
expensive but also a major neces-sity. Speciﬁ  cally, I’m talking about birth control and getting tested. 
Not necessarily the most fun. Even 
less so if you’re considering the eco-nomical route: the local health depart-ment. 
But I’m here to tell you, it’s not as 
bad as it sounds. 
Here are some tips: 1. Have at least three hours to 
burn.  
Speeding up government employ-
ees isn’t going to happen.  
2. Bring a photo ID and a pay stub 
or awards letter. The latter is for determining your 
cost. You will often end up paying little or nothing, even for birth control pills and condoms. 
3. Breathe.  
This can be an easy thing to forget 
when getting your blood taken. 
4. Ask questions.  
These people have seen it all, and 
nothing you will say or ask is going to 
impress or shock them. Just get the 
information you need from a medi-cal professional so you don’t have to wonder if something your roommate, friend or Flavor Flav said is accurate. 
5. Relax Calm down, especially during the 
swab, but also remember to do this during the entire visit. Though easier 
said than done, realize that everyone 
in college and every adult, for that mat-ter, deals with sexual health. You are 
not alone. It’s deﬁ  nitely not a sexy pro-
cess but vital in ensuring sexy things continue to happen for you. 
  Also, things like abstinence, mo-
nogamy and safe sex will reduce the stress of these visits. Just saying. Mul-tiple risky encounters are obviously go-ing to give you more to think about in the waiting room. 
6. Getting your results You will get the HIV test results be-
fore you leave. Keep in mind that ex-posures within three months may not show up on the test. 
  It takes one to two weeks to get 
the lab results for the other tests, so keep phone number they give you.

� STRIPES,  BIG ACCESSORIES ARE 
MUST-HAVES FOR SUMMER.
By ALISHA KINMAN 
avenue writer
While fashion boutiques decorate their 
storefronts to attract summer shoppers, the 
time for students to start cleaning out their 
closets is now. 
Give away your daisy dukes, crocks and 
low-rise jeans with the rest of those spring things you no longer need. This summer is 
all about being comfortable and choosing the right accessories to match.
Macy’s and Nordstroms have given shop-
pers a sneak peek of what to expect for sum-
mer trends.  Floral patterns on mid-thigh skirts and sundresses made the cut. Other items to watch include denim and striped ap-
parel.
“Stripes will be very in this season. I’ve 
seen it on cotton and silk shirts and on ac-
cessories too,” said Christy Morgan, the own-
er of Dahlia in Thornebrook Village.
In addition, oversized canvas tote bags 
paired with khaki mid-thigh shorts and a 
white cotton button-down top can make for a classic all-American look.
Rompers, white jeans, summer dresses 
and mini-layered skirts are popular, said Bethy Pierre, an employee at Macy’s at the 
Oaks Mall and public relations student at UF.  
Harper’s Bazaar, an elite fashion magazine, 
recommends metallic blazers, pastels and army green jackets as must-haves. 
Also, Bazaar recommends invest-
ing in neutral colored gladiator san-
dals to match earth-toned outfits.  
Remember, an outfit can appear drab with-out its accessories.
 Luckily, the skinny belt, chunky beaded 
necklaces and leather-strap watches will be -
come popular commodities this season.
But you do not have to shop at high-end 
clothing department stores to recreate a look out of Vogue. 
For instance, long, chunky neck -
laces can be found at  Target for $16 
compared to necklaces at Bloom-
ingdales that range from $40 to $100.  
     Keeping up with the latest trends might 
come with a price tag, but the investment of staying on top of the latest trends while feeling better about the way you dress is not 
worth forgoing.

Facebook update frustrates some loyal users  
By MARGARET GRECO 
avenue writer
Just when the e-dust settled and 
pretty much everyone forgot what 
the “old Facebook” looked like, the 
unstoppable website did it again. The company’s new changes to pro -
files’ information section strip us-ers of any sort of individuality and 
beg the question: Really?! 
A few years ago, Facebook had 
some semblance of credibility. Us-
ers had to prove their affiliation to 
a college or company network, and 
our parents hadn’t heard of the site  yet.     
 Now the social networking site 
feels more like a family reunion — 
you’re surrounded by people you 
don’t really want to talk to, but somehow they seem to know way too much about your life. 
In the past few weeks, I have no -
ticed several friends threatening to leave Facebook for good because of privacy concerns and general disenchantment with the site. The 
disillusioned may gain followers 
and notoriety if Facebook doesn’t clean up its act soon (which is high-ly unlikely). So, should we stay or should we 
go? 
PROS:
� There’s really no alternative.  
Well, there’s MySpace and Twitter, but those are pretty much just pun-
ishments. With no other competi-
tive alternative, leaving Facebook may mean virtual social isolation. Your friends will keep writing on 
each other’s walls and uploading 
the party pics that you will never be tagged in. And how will you stalk people? 
� It’s convenient. If you are un-
der 30, a Facebook account has almost become a prerequisite to living. It’s assumed that you have one. Being a member of the site 
grants you access via a singular 
medium to most of the people that you need to communicate with. It’s a one-stop shop and a lot easier than calling or sending e-mails. 
� It achieves its purpose: It con-
nects. There is no doubt about Fa-cebook’s connective nature. With the addition of the News Feed fea-
ture, users might even feel a little 
too connected to each other. Face -
book does keep us in contact with our friends and family. But is it giv -
ing us too much contact? 
� It’s easier than doing some-
thing productive. Self-explanatory. 
CONS: 
� The new changes. The chang-
es to profile’s information section make it impossible to have unique 
interests. Now the only informa-
tion users are allowed to include in their profiles must be chosen 
from a predetermined 
list of information that 
can be linked to others’ profiles. Not only is this 
annoying, it’s a thinly veiled strat-egy to make even more money by 
targeting ads to our profiles. 
� It’s an extreme waste of time.  
It can be fun, but it’s a time-waster. 
Anyone who has walked through 
the computer labs on campus or 
has been to Library West should know this. When we have projects to do, Facebook seems even more appealing than ever. 
� Family invasion. It can be awk -
ward when family members add you on Facebook, and it’s even more awkward when they comment on 
your status about having no recol-lection of last night. If you do suc-
cumb to the guilt trips and add your parents and extended family, Facebook’s tricky privacy settings 
keep you wondering, “Can I be sure 
that they can’t see my pictures/wall/anything personal about me?” Which brings me to… 
� Is Facebook even capable of 
keeping your information private? 
In a May 5 article, The New 
York Times reported that a glitch allowed Facebook users to read 
their friends’ private chat conversa-
tions and see their ‘’’online friends’ pending social requests.”
 This may not seem that scary or 
surprising, but it is another reason 
why people are getting freaked out 
by the (lack of) control that Face -
book has over their personal infor -
mation. Lesson: If you don’t want 
absolutely everyone in the world to 
have access to it, don’t put it on Fa-cebook. 
The choice to delete or not to de -
lete (if you can even figure out how 
to do it) is yours. But I’m predicting 
that until someone creates some -
thing better and less controlling, Facebook is here to stay and so will 
be the majority of its current users.

“You’re staying in Gainesville for the 
summer?” This is the last thing my friend 
said to me after I had finished helping him move out of his apartment a couple of weeks ago. He didn’t bother to wait 
around for an answer or an explanation. 
He simply peeled out of the dusty park -
ing lot, leaving me coated in a fine layer 
of dirt and shame, alone in a city ren -
dered desolate in the summer months. 
It can’t all be bad, right? I’m pretty 
sure there are perks to staying here this summer and taking classes, but since I’ve never done anything like this be-fore, I’m left to face this long, deserted 
stretch of a semester alone. To maintain 
the sanity I’m risking by staying the sum -
mer in Gainesville, I need to find the sil-
ver lining of this sad, lonely cloud. 
What comes to my mind first might 
be the greatest benefit to living in 
Gainesville during the summer: sig-
nificantly decreased zombie presence. Significantly de -
creased human 
presence, too, 
for that matter. Bottom line: I can actually wear my socks instead of using them as ar -
maments, and I don’t have to suf -
fer the indignity of carrying a Nerf gun with me to class. 
Also, I get to continue living away from 
my parents, which is always better than the opposite. Oh, you want curfews and family dinners? I’ll be right here, playing Playstation 3 in my underwear and grow -
ing my beard in peace, suckers. 
Dear readers (all eight of you), this 
long summer ahead of us may seem daunting. However, keep in mind that there are perfectly good reasons to be here over the summer. You just need to find your own to not go crazy. Like being able to find parking on campus. 
Oh, and furthering your education. How to survive, enjoy
the summer’s slowdown

Tommy Toledo has been thinking about his last outing 
for 59 days. 
But in the sophomore’s first appearance since March 14, 
when he suffered a fractured nose and several broken bones 
in his face after being hit by a line drive against Charleston Southern, he blocked out the past.
Toledo received a standing ovation from the 3,147 Gators 
fans in attendance when he entered in the seventh inning of No. 4 Florida’s (34-12, 17-7 Southeastern Conference) 7-3 win against FAU (31-19) in McKethan Stadium Wednesday. 
“That was unbelievable,” Toledo said. “I wasn’t expect-
ing that at all. I was just surprised I kept throwing strikes in the warm-up pitches. I was shaking up there, to be honest, but that was a cool feeling.”
Catcher Mike Zunino said watching Toledo walk back on 
the mound was special.
“I got chills out there when he went out there and got that 
standing ovation,” he said. 
Zunino greeted Toledo at the mound before he started 
warming up. The two slapped gloves and Zunino told him Toledo makes return in 7-3 victory

For some reason we were all 
surprised.
Most of us assumed 
the 6-foot-8 power forward who couldn’t buy playing time late in 
games would opt to enter the NBA 
Draft and would forgo his senior season.
But Alex Tyus never really had 
much of a choice but to return to school, although his father, Thom-as Tyus, gave off another impres-
sion.
“I don’t 
think he has anything to gain by re-turning to the Univer-sity of Flor-ida basket-ball wise,” T h o m a s 
said to the Orlando Sentinel. “I just feel he just has not developed his full potential. … He can go back and get his degree any time.”
If Tyus hasn’t fulfilled his po-
tential in the 70 games he has start-ed during the last two seasons, I don’t know if he ever will max out his talent.
On a squad that narrowly made 
the NCAA Tournament last sea-son, Tyus averaged 11.8 points per game (fourth highest on the team), while committing three and a half turnovers for every one assist he dished out.
Those aren’t exactly the num-
bers team executives like Pat Ri-
ley are looking for in a first-round 
draft pick.
With that being said, we should 
commend the rising senior’s deci-sion because it was the right one.
When he entered his name 
into the crapshoot that is the NBA Draft, Tyus said he would not Tyus’ plan 
to stay should shock none
� SEC TOURNEY TO BEGIN TODAY.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
For 188 consecutive games, senior Cor-
rie Brooks has shown up at the ballpark on 
game day and done whatever her coaches 
and teammates asked of her. 
Whether the Gators needed a big-time 
play at third base, a clutch game-tying or 
game-winning hit in the bottom of the sev-
enth, or even an extra outfielder or reserve 
pitcher, Brooks has always been there. 
And when the No. 6 Gators (42-7, 20-4 
Southeastern Conference) take the field to 
play Auburn (30-23, 11-17 SEC) today at 
2:30 p.m. in the first round of the SEC tour-
nament, Brooks will once again be there for 
the 262nd time in her UF career, putting her only 11 behind Ashley Boone for the all-time Florida games-played record. 
“I think it is significant because that just 
says something about how great of a team we are,” Brooks said. “I’ve gotten the op-portunity to play that many games because our teams have been good enough to make it that far, and it definitely says a lot for me 
to be a starter on that good of a team.”
It’s been 824 days since Brooks last 
missed a start on Feb. 9, 2008 against Mem-
phis- the fourth game of her sophomore 
season. 
Perhaps not coincidentally that was 
about the same time 
Brooks started bringing her lucky gator head to 
the games, a tradition 
she’s kept alive ever 
since. 
“One of the times I 
was working at the ga-tor farm they had a few 
alligators that people had brought in, and they were just throwing away the heads and feet and everything, and I said ‘Well I’d like to have one of these,’” Brooks said. “So I took it to the taxidermist and got it done and since then I’ve just brought it on every road trip and everything.”
And while not many people usually 
get to experience alligators that up-close 
and personal, for the residents of the small 
town of Christmas, that closeness with na-ture is just the way of life. 
The 3.6 square-mile town that’s last re-
corded population was 1,369 is what has 
made Brooks into the person she is today - 
a girl who says her main hobbies are hunt-ing, fishing and riding four-wheelers and horses. 
“That’s pretty much just from living out 
in the country and having really nothing else to do,” Brooks said. “We have a pond with catfish in our back yard and growing up with a family that was raised outdoors and having them pass that stuff along to me led to me taking it up and that’s what I like to do.”
It is that upbringing that has led Brooks 
to pursue a degree in Animal Science, Brooks nears UF games-played recordSEE BASEBALL, p AGE 21

Senior Corrie Brooks is 11 games away from breaking the UF games-played record. She hasn’t 
missed a game in 824 days. Ashley Boone, who played from 1998 to 2001, holds the record. leave UF unless he was guaranteed 
to be a first-round selection. He stuck by that sentiment.
ESPN’s Chad Ford and Andy 
Katz both believed it was very pos-
sible he would go undrafted and 
advised Tyus to return to school when making their NBA Draft pro-jections. With only 60 players draft-ed into the NBA each year, Ford had him as the 116th best player on his board.
Taking all that into account, 
nobody should have been caught 
off guard to learn of his return last 
weekend. 
Tyus did the same thing he 
did last season when he threat-
ened to transfer.  
But this year’s decision will 
benefit the team more than it does 
Tyus.
The Gators will now bring back 
all five starters from last season and are poised to be a top-three team in the Southeastern Conference next 
year.
CBS’s Gary Parrish ranked Flor-
ida as the 10th best team in his pre-
season top 25, which was released yesterday.  
On the other hand, Tyus’ deci-
sion to return won’t necessarily help his draft stock much.
He will be spending most of his 
time at power forward next season, despite contending that his natural position is at the three. But Chan-dler Parsons has already won that role after a stellar junior year.
And it’s not like Tyus won’t 
have competition at his position. For some reason coach Billy Dono-van didn’t trust him at the end of games as he opted to use Dan Wer-ner in crucial situations most of the time instead.
This year Tyus will have to com-
pete with UF’s new five-star recruit Patric Young for time in the front court.
Still, coming back was his only 
option and the team will be better for it. Tyus on the other hand, I’m not so sure about.ANTHONY , from page 20Sophomore pitcher throws one scoreless frame
to have fun.  
The pitcher received a similar warm 
greeting when he walked off the mound 
after pitching a scoreless, yet far from 
flawless, frame. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
admitted he grew emotional watching To-
ledo pitch.
 “As a coach, you get a little choked 
up,” he said. “I mean, you know how 
tough it was to get back up here. To be honest with you, if it was up to him, he probably would have been ready to 
go (last weekend) at Alabama. He was 
chomping at the bit.”
O’Sullivan said he wanted to hold the 
pitcher until he could throw in a home 
game. The coach does not know whether 
Toledo will stay in the bullpen or become a starter like he was before the metal plates were put in his face.Toledo needs to rebuild his arm 
strength as if he was back in spring train-ing, O’Sullivan said.
On Toledo’s first pitch, Owls third 
baseman Nick Burkhalter hit a hard line drive just left of the pitcher for a single. Nathan Pittman hit Toledo’s third pitch 
just as hard to the right 
for a line out. 
Toledo said he did not 
think about his injury on 
the mound, though.
FAU third baseman 
Joey Burkhalter followed 
his teammate with a sin-gle to right-center. After 
throwing just his fourth pitch in almost two months, Toledo received a visit from Zunino.
The catcher told him to keep the ball 
down and called for a breaking ball. To-ledo recovered, throwing a strike.“I know he’s thrown about three or 
four bullpens, but to be as pinpoint as he was, that was the Tommy Toledo of old right there,” Zunino said.
Zunino helped his hurler in the next 
at-bat, picking Burkhalter off at first. To-ledo then struck out Anthony Mesa with a slider to end the inning, igniting the 
crowd in the process.
“That was a pretty cool feeling,” To-
ledo said. “I’m excited to get it over with, 
but it was probably one of the best feel-ings I’ve ever had here at Florida.”
His teammates greeted him with a sim-
ilar reception.
“He battled real hard to get back into 
it,” said senior Matt den Dekker, who hit 
one of UF’s three home runs Wednesday. 
“He comes out and works hard every day. He’s such a great kid, on and off the field. To see him back out here like that, it was awesome. It was a great moment for us.”BASE , from page 20
Brooks to 
graduate in August
which she hopes to parlay into 
a job either with the USDA or as 
an agriculture teacher. 
And although the senior will 
be leaving the softball program 
after this season and leaving UF 
when she gradu-ates in August, both her coaches and teammates will not be quick to forget her.
“I just want them to re-
member me as somebody who worked hard, did what she was told, never talked back, and never questioned anything anybody was doing,” Brooks said. “Just as somebody that they could talk to and know I wouldn’t say anything out of line.”SOFT , from page 20

NBA PLAYOFFS
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO  — Team Sweep 
has more time to do some house-
cleaning.
Waiting around for its next 
opponent again, about the only questions the playoff-perfect Or-lando Magic face are when and 
where they will begin the East-
ern Conference finals. Fourteen straight wins — including 8-0 in the postseason — have left the Magic beaming with confidence 
ahead of another lengthy layoff.
But the time off provides no as-
surance of continued success.
“The one thing you have to un-
derstand about playoff basketball 
is you’ve got to get beyond the last game and the last series,” Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. “It has no meaning for the game or 
the series coming up, whatsoever. 
So you go in with good confi-dence, you get a little rest, but it will come down to how you play in the next series.”
Orlando proved prior perfec-
tion — or imperfection — doesn’t guarantee anything last year, when it squeaked out two series before toppling the unbeaten Cleveland 
Cavaliers in the conference finals. 
Now Boston leads the Cavaliers 3-2 in the best-of-seven series after winning 120-88 on Tuesday night, and Orlando is the team with time 
to wait and watch.
The earliest Orlando will play 
again is Sunday, and it could be 
as long as next Tuesday — eight 
days between games. The Magic 
would have home-court advan-tage against Boston but would start on the road against Cleve-land.
Van Gundy gave his team two 
days off — again — after dusting aside Atlanta in the most lopsided four-game sweep in NBA playoff 
history. The Magic will return to 
practice Thursday and try to avoid the kind of overconfidence and complacency that led to Cleve-land’s downfall last season.
That might be the only thing 
Van Gundy doesn’t seem con-cerned about.
“I’ve said the one thing that I 
have real confidence in with our team is our mind set, our prepa-ration and what we bring to the game in terms of energy and in-tensity will be very good,” he said. 
“If we get beat and when we get 
beat, it will be just because some-body outplays us. It’s not going to be because our guys aren’t ready to play. I really have confidence in 
that.”
The motivated Magic have 
played like a team on a mission 
lately.It had blowout wins of 43, 14, 
30 and 14 against Atlanta. It got 
Dwight Howard out of his foul-
trouble funk, and they’ve locked opponents down defensively.
Still sometimes viewed as the 
irritating interloper that derailed a LeBron James-Kobe Bryant show-down in last year’s NBA Finals, Orlando enters the conference fi-nals as the favorite to squash such 
talk again. The Magic haven’t lost 
since its regular-season matchup at San Antonio on April 2.
“I just think if we do the things 
we’ve done to get us to this point,” Howard said, “we should beat anybody.”
They’re also in better position 
to do so this year.
Point guard Jameer Nelson, 
sidelined the first three rounds last season with a right shoulder tear, is healthy again and playing 
like he was when he earned a spot 
on the All-Star team in 2009. The addition of Matt Barnes has given the Magic a gritty defender, and newcomer Jason Williams has an-
chored one of the deepest benches 
in the league as the backup point guard.
For all the questions about how 
Vince Carter would replace Hedo Turkoglu in the lineup, that has been almost a non-issue through two rounds. Carter is in the con-ference finals for the first time in 
his career, averaging 16.9 points 
per game in the playoffs.
Although perfection isn’t likely 
to last in the next round, striving 
for it is helping the Magic stay fo-
cused.
“I’d like to go 16-0,” Carter 
said. “When you’re playing this well, you don’t want to lose. You 
want teams to always have fear 
in their minds and think to them-selves, ‘We can’t beat these guys.’ You never want to have a nick in 
your armor.
“Why not stay flawless if you 
can?”
Magic look to stay sharp during possible long layoff

you can?”

Lauren Embree and the women’s tennis team have won 17 straight matches and are 
undefeated at home this season. The team last lost Feb. 14 against UCLA.
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
The No. 3 Gators women’s tennis team 
(24-2) has been named champions twice this 
season and now the mission to win the third 
and most important championship begins 
Friday.
The Southeastern Conference’s regular-
season and tournament champions’ first challenge on the path to the NCAA Cham-pionship will come Friday at 2 p.m. against Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champion South Carolina State (13-5)
South Carolina State is on a current four-
match winning streak that began with a road 
upset over ECU 4-3 on April 12.
Florida’s current 17-match winning streak 
began in February with a shutout of in-state 
rival FSU.  Part of the streak can be attributed to the Gators dominance at home, where they are undefeated.
After finishing the regular season with a 
three-game road trip and playing the SEC 
tournament in Athens, Ga., the players are 
excited to be back on their home court in Gainesville.
“That’s a huge advantage to have all the 
Gainesville Gators fans right behind us, cheering for us,” No. 9 freshman Lauren Em-
bree said.
Embree, the recently-named SEC Player of 
the Year, has excelled at home. Seven of Em-bree’s 16 wins at the No. 1 spot in singles this 
season came at home after the rough three-loss performance at the ITA Team Tourna-ment in Charlottesville, Va.Embree is not the only Gator with an im-
pressive win streak heading into Friday.
SEC Freshman of the Year Allie Will has 
yet to be defeated in the dual-match season in singles play.  Will posts a 20-0 record at the No. 2 position this spring.
If the Gators continue their dominance at 
home and defeat South Carolina State, they will face either Washington or Utah on Sat-
urday at 3 p.m. in the second round.
The No. 6 Gators men’s tennis team (19-4) 
will also be hosting South Carolina State (14-
10)  in the first round on Saturday at noon.
Florida is looking to bounce back from a 
4-0 loss in the SEC tournament champion-ship to No. 2 Tennessee.
Despite falling just short of two goals for 
this season - the SEC regular-
season and tournament cham-
pionships - UF men’s coach Andy Jackson has a posi-tive outlook heading into the NCAA Tournament.
“Hosting is something that was a goal 
and it’s hard-earned, so we’re excited about 
that,” Jackson said.
If the men’s squad defeats South Carolina 
State, it may face a familiar foe.  No. 31 Au-
burn is also in Gainesville to face Troy in the 
first round.
UF won both meetings against the Tigers 
this season.  On March 12, Florida defeated Auburn 5-2 in Gainesville.  In the SEC tour-nament, the Gators won the rematch with Auburn 4-1 in the SEC tournament semifi-nals in Lexington, Ky.UF tennis teams to begin

UF TRACK & FIELD
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
The UF track and field teams head to 
Knoxville, Tenn., today to compete in the 
Southeastern Conference Outdoor Cham-pionships on a mission: bring home cham-pionships.
Second isn’t an option. “We felt like we let ourselves down last 
year,” UF coach Mike Holloway said. “We were second in everything, with the excep-tion of the regional meet. In every one of those instances, we could have won the meet. This year, we are making sure we’re at our absolute best.”
The men’s team finished the first part 
of its mission at the 2010 NCAA Indoor Championship – now, it looks to do the same in Volunteer country.
Although the men’s team finished sec-
ond last year, the women’s team is looking to defend its outdoor title from a season ago.
The men’s team is seeking its first SEC 
Outdoor Championship since the 1987 season, while the women’s team is seeking the prestigious “Triple Crown” after win-ning the 2009 SEC Cross Country Cham-pionship and the 2010 SEC Indoor Cham-pionship.
The “Triple Crown” has only been ac-
complished once in school history when the women’s team did it in the 1996-97 season. 
The Gators head to Knoxville as two 
top-10 programs, ready to face the stiffest competition in the country. 
The men’s team is ranked third nation-
ally, the highest-rated SEC men’s team. The women’s team is also in the top 10, coming in 10th nationally, second in the conference behind No. 2 LSU. 
The SEC boasts some of the most elite 
track and field programs in the country, 
with eight men’s teams ranked in the top 
25. The SEC has four programs represent-ed in the women’s top 25. 
The Gators come to the Outdoor Cham-
pionships looking to defend nine individ-
ual titles from last year’s 
outdoor meet.
All-American sprint-
ers Jeff Demps, Tony McQuay and Calvin Smith look to lead the fastest team in America to more records. The Gator men’s team enters 
the meet with the top-ranked 400-meter runner in the world, Smith, and the top-ranked 4x400 meter relay team in the world. 
Smith, the top-ranked 400 meter runner 
in the world, leads the top 4x100 meter re-lay team in the nation. 
Other Gator All-Americans including 
thrower Mariam Kevkhishvili and jumper Shara Proctor look to defend their titles 
and continue their outstanding perfo-
mance this season.
“We’re going to do what we always 
do,” Holloway said. “We’re going to take 
care of the Gators.”Gators ready for SECs

star Dwyane Wade watched silently Wednesday as trial proceedings began in a $25 million breach-of-contract law-
suit filed by former partners in a failed 
restaurant venture.
A panel of six jurors were selected 
after about five hours of question-ing. Opening statements are expected Thursday.
The lawsuit — one of many Wade is 
dealing with this offseason, including a bitter divorce and custody case in Chica-
go — is over the defunct deal over what 
was to be a chain of D. Wade’s Place restaurants. The former partners claim he broke a contract by demanding high-er compensation and then abandoning the deal in 2008, shortly after two of the short-lived restaurants opened.
Wade contends he was within his 
rights to terminate the arrangement and 
is also seeking damages from plaintiffs 
Mark Rodberg and Lauren Hollander because of what he “believes to be the wrongful use of his name attached to a restaurant,” said Michael Kreitzer, an attorney for the 2006 NBA Finals MVP.
Wade’s celebrity factor was evident, though order was constant. Jury selec-tion largely revolved around whether the selected residents of South Florida — where Wade has starred for seven years — would be swayed by his bas-
ketball exploits.
The suit was filed in December 2008, 
alleging Wade Global Enterprises — 
owned by Wade and Andrews — made “unjustifiable and unreasonable” de-mands such as a 30 percent ownership stake in the restaurant enterprise. The original deal, according to the suit, called for Wade to receive a 10 percent 
stake and Andrews a 2 percent share.
“My clients claim substantial dam-
ages, substantial damages in this case,” 
Bales said. “Would any of you have a problem awarding substantial dam-ages if and only if you feel the evidence warrants and requires substantial dam-ages?”
Wade was in court earlier this week 
in Chicago for more hearings involving his lengthy divorce and custody fight with estranged wife Siohvaughn Wade.
The next hearing in the divorce case 
is scheduled for May 28, though that could change.
Until then, Wade’s full attention is 
expected to be on the breach suit, which 
is scheduled to last two weeks and with as many as 62 possible witnesses. In-cluding the former owner of Kentucky Fried Chicken, John Y. Brown.Wade appears in courtTennis24, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 13, 2010
