A man was charged with battery this weekend for striking a 
homeless man  outside Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
Jason Kauffman was taken into custody at about 10:15 p.m. 
Saturday after reports that he punched an unidentified homeless 
man. Kauffman, who has a wife and three kids, said he was just trying to defend his family . 
 “He came at me with a broken beer bottle first,” he  said. “I 
swung at him, hit him and I started walking away . He shouldn’t have swung a broken beer bottle at me in the first place.”
According to the UF Police Department, Kauffman was given 
a notice to appear in court. The man’s status is uncertain.

It took no second-half points, 
one second-half pass and 33 pass-
ing yards for Mississippi State to 
hand Florida its third consecu-tive loss Saturday night in The Swamp. 
The Gators (4-3, 2-3 Southeast-
ern Conference) lost on home-coming for the fist time since 1988, lost at home to the Bulldogs for the first time since 1965 and 
are unranked in the AP Poll for 
the first time in Urban Meyer’s six seasons as head coach. 
“Yeah, this is [a low point],” 
senior center Mike Pouncey said. “I can’t remember the last time I ever lost three games in my whole life. This is one of the toughest times of my life. I’m gonna talk to 
people, with my teammates that 
are close to me, and we’ll just stick together and get through this.”
MSU coach, and former UF of-
fensive coordinator, Dan Mullen led the Bulldogs to a 10-0 half-time lead before essentially run-ning out the clock for the final 30 minutes of the game. 
After halftime, he called one 
pass play — a shovel that went for a 5-yard loss — and challenged coordinator Steve Addazio and 
the Gators’ offense, ranked 91st in 
yards per game and 65th in scor -
ing nationally, to erase the deficit while his Bulldogs held the ball for more than 17 minutes. 
UF’s offense was unable to 
respond, as MSU running back Vick Ballard and quarterback Chris Relf combined for 180 rush-ing yards, controlling the clock 
and limiting the Gators to four 
second-half drives. 
“We’re not very good,” coach 
Urban Meyer said. “We’ve got to ‘WE’RE NOT VERY GOOD’

for University Police, said the depart-

Thousands of people packed Gainesville 
streets and the UF campus this weekend to 
celebrate the 87th UF Homecoming.
Despite the Gators’ recent losses on the 
football field, fans, students and alumni 
were still filled with spirit as they cheered 
and participated in the traditional Home-
coming events. 
More than 1,500 people registered to 
run, skate and bike in the Gator Gallop race preceding Friday’s Homecoming Parade.  
Crispyn Coller, director of Gator Gal-
lop, said the race is meant to unite the Gainesville community.
“This is kind of saying a thank you to 
the community for their support,” he said. “It’s amazing—the excitement of everyone 
coming back. It’s a fun atmosphere.”
Racers paid $10 to register online and 
$15 the day of the race. The registration fee 
paid for T-shirts and also went to benefit 
the Florida Track Club.
UF alumna Christy Brigman skated her 
way to the finishline with her husband. 
They both graduated in 1999. 
“It’s fun to come back to Gainesville,” 
she said. “I love it every time we come 
back.”
The race track stretched from the Percy 
Beard Track at Pressly Stadium to South-Events show Gators spirit“I can’t remember the 
last time I ever lost three 
games in my whole life. 
This is one of the toughest 
times of my life.”

Man arrested for theft, 
threatening on campus
A Gainesville man was ar -
rested Thursday on a charge of 
stealing a laptop and threaten-
ing two people with a gun on 
campus.
At about 12:30 p.m., witness-
es said they saw a man wander -
ing around the Marston Science 
Library waiting for people to get 
up and leave their things.   After 
he watched someone walk out 
of the room, witnesses saw the 
man sit down and play on the student’s Samsung laptop as if it 
were his, said UF Police Depart-ment detective James Mabry.  
The man then put the laptop 
in a nearby backpack and walked away. One of the witnesses con-fronted the man about stealing 
the laptop, but he continued walking. 
After the library desk was told 
about the incident, an employee 
and the witness confronted the man together, and the man told 
them to stop following him be-cause he had a gun and would 
shoot them.
James McCray was found ten 
minutes later by UPD officers a 
few blocks away from Sorority 
Row, said Mabry. He did not 
have a gun on him, and when 
asked about threatening the wit-
nesses, McCray said he didn’t 
know anything about a gun. Mc-
Cray was arrested and charged with grand theft for the stolen 
property and robbery for telling 
the witnesses that he had a gun.

from 92 in 2007 to 49 this season.
The number of UF students 
among those arrested has also 
dropped, from 22 in 2007 to 8 this year.
The leading cause for game ejec-
tion and arrest is possession of alco-hol, an offense that has also seen its 
numbers drop since 2007.
Despite the drop in number of 
arrests, the total number of ejections has increased, from 212 in 2007 to 
243 this year.
Holcomb said night games tend 
to lead to more arrests and ejections from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, cit-ing alcohol consumed throughout 
the day as a factor that plays into 
people’s behavior at the game.
“[A night game] gives people 
more time to tailgate,” he said.
From the 2007 season through 
the 2009 season, the first three SEC home games have only included one kickoff time past 3:30 p.m.
This year, all three games have 
had kickoff times of 7 p.m. or later.
Holcomb said drinking less all 
day will help curb arrest and ejec-tion numbers.
“Try to avoid alcohol in mass 
quantities,” he said.
He said the only way to prevent 
getting into trouble is to simply be-
come familiar with the rules.
“Know the laws and follow 
them,” he said.Evening games tend to lead to more people being arrested or ejected

Meanwhile, lining up along Univer -
sity Avenue, the earliest arriving fans and 
spectators in lawn chairs bundled in their 
blankets and sipped on hot coffee to stay warm before the 87th annual Homecom-ing Parade. 
There were 150 floats this year, accord-
ing to parade director Shane Yarchin. 
He said there were about 100,000 people 
watching along the parade route, which stretched from Gale Lemerand Drive to 
Main Street.
The parade kicked off at noon with 
the Alachua County Sheriff, UPD and 
Gainesville Police Department officers 
showing off their motorcycle skills.The UF Marching Band played, as 
well as marching bands from local high 
schools. 
Many local businesses and community 
groups also participated in the parade.
Most floats featured the colors orange 
and blue, and spectators saw more than one stuffed gator. 
“The parade showed me something 
more about UF,” freshman Sally Cohen said. “It showed me that The Gator Nation isn’t just about the students or the sports, 
it transcends into the entire town. Every-
body is a Gator and everyone loves it.”
Fans and alumni also came together for 
the 87th Gator Growl pep rally, which is billed as the largest student-run pep rally 
in the country. 
Instead of featuring one comedian and a band like in the previous three years, the 
event featured three comedians: Aziz An-sari, Kevin Hart and Dan Levy. 
The comedians easily drew the best 
crowd response out of any of the other en-
tertainment, said Megan McGonigle, a 17-year-old who watched from the student 
section.
The show was also filled with the cus-
tomary Gator Growl skits and commer -
cials. 
Gator athletics figured prominently into 
the fanfare, including appearances by the men and women’s basketball teams and the Florida football senior class.
Cameos from various celebrities and 
former Gator athletics stars were played 
between the acts.
David DeVinney, director of public re-
lations for Gator Growl, estimated about 
35,000 people attended the event.
“All the directors were really pleased 
with the show,” DeVinney said. “It went great. It was very entertaining, we all thought.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2010

  Students raced across campus Sunday for Pi Delta Psi’s 
annual Amazing Race.
  The event was held to to increase cultural awareness on campus and to empower a united voice within the 
Asian-American community.
  The event is part of Kaleidoscope Month—a celebra-
tion of the histories, cultures, and contributions of Asians 
and Asian-Americans in the areas of the arts and sciences, entertainment, education, politics and sports.
  Twelve teams, made up of four to ﬁ  ve members each, 
started the race at the Reitz Union Colonnade and raced to 10 different stations across campus.
  Each station was represented by different cultural or-
ganizations in the Asian-American community. 
  The race lasted for about two hours and ended at the 
Reitz Union Colonnade. 
  The proceeds from the race will go to the Building 
Dreams Foundation, said Andrew Chu, president of Pi 
Delta Psi and treasurer of the foundation. 
  One of the missions of the Building Dreams Foundation 
is to unify the Asian-American community in the ﬁ  ght to 
bring equal resources to Asian-American students. 
  “Our primary goal is to raise awareness about the 
Asian-American community,” Chu said. 
  Last year, Pi Delta Psi raised $500 for the Building 
Dreams Foundation. 
  The winner of this year’s race was the Health Educated 
Asian Leaders team. 
  “[Our] mission is to provide resources for all pre-
health students by providing volunteer opportunities like 
the Amazing Race,” said Linda Nguyen, president of the 
organization. 
  The ﬁ  rst, second and third place teams received gift 
cards from Olive Garden, Publix, Red Mango and other restaurants and businesses. 
  Everyone who participated in the race received a cou-
pon for a free appetizer from TGI Friday’s.  MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 5

Capital punishment is cruel and unusual 
An eye for an eye. 
This way of thinking can be traced back to 
the Code of Hammurabi, a set of Babylonian law 
codes from about 1792 B.C. These codes stated, among 
other things, “If a man puts out the eye of an equal, his eye shall be put out.” 
The sad thing is, nearly 4,000 years later in the U.S. 
we are still using a version of these codes in the form of 
capital punishment. 
Capital punishment, more often referred to as the 
death penalty, is still on the books in 37 states in this 
country. Only two states have ruled it unconstitutional 
by their state Supreme Courts. 
The Supreme Court of the United States has heard 
capital punishment arguments on multiple occasions 
and has ruled both ways in the past. 
For those at home who don’t quite remember the 
Eighth Amendment, it’s that kind-of-important part of 
the Constitution that grants you security from cruel and unusual punishment from the government. 
I find it hard to believe anyone would try to say 
death is not cruel.
But what about unusual? Every major superpower 
in Europe has eliminated the death penalty, so to these 
countries, I suppose capital punishment would be quite 
unusual. 
In fact, with the exception of Latvia and Belarus, Eu-
rope is entirely capital punishment free. That even in-cludes Russia, which currently has a moratorium on the 
use of the death penalty. 
To really drive the point home, the U.S. is one of only 
three industrialized democracies in the world to still 
have capital punishment, and one of those other two currently has a moratorium on its use as well. That seems pretty un-usual to me. 
We also have to deal with the 
possibility of an innocent person being convicted of murder and be-ing executed. If an innocent indi-
vidual is convicted but sentenced 
to life without parole, then there’s 
a possibility once the truth is discovered they can be released. But if they have already been executed, well, there’s not a whole lot one can do about it. 
Don’t think that’s all that common? Since 1973 there 
have been 138 people released from death row after new evidence proved their innocence.These are the lucky people who had their innocence proved before their ex-
ecution happened. 
In this economy, we’re all looking for any way pos-
sible to save a few bucks here and there. If only the gov-
ernment would take that approach too. Replacing capi-tal punishment with a sentence of life without parole 
would save quite a bit of money. 
In a report issued from our very own UF, the aver -
age cost of an execution in Florida is $3.2 million, as 
opposed to the $600,000 it would cost to keep that same 
person in jail for life. Those are millions of dollars that 
could be put to good use in these downtrodden eco-nomic times. 
So wait, we would be improving our country socially 
and economically by not killing more people? It seems 
way too good to be true.

90 TOTAL VOTES20% PARADE
52% FOOTBALL GAME28% GATOR GROWLFor a nation so grossly aroused by confrontation, the U.S. 
does a fine job sweeping semi--important secrets under the rug. 
The New York Times reported this weekend it received 
information from a senior administration official that the FBI 
had a record on file for the terrorist responsible for leading the 
deadly attacks on Mumbai in 2008 that killed at least 163 people in the second most populous city in the world. 
According to the source, a Moroccan woman warned Ameri-
can officials in Pakistan less than a year before the horrific at-tack. She believed her husband, David Headley , was plotting a terrorist act to incite future violence between the nuclear pow-erhouses of India and Pakistan. 
And years before that, American officials in New York were 
also warned of Headley’s potential involvement with a terrorist organization. 
For a country so distastefully enraptured by grief, it did 
nothing. 
American knowledge of a potential future attack revitalizes 
still-bleeding sentiments from the Sept. 11 era and makes us question the very notion of safety and who’s watching out for whom.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, several American officials, includ-
ing Condoleezza Rice, admitted they had received official secu-rity briefs warning that Osama bin Laden was planning attacks on America. 
We’re not defense experts, but perhaps a red flag should 
have been raised with a security brief like that.
Especially after 2001, perhaps even a note in passing of the 
slight possibility of someone planning to incite nuclear war should pique our interest. Mum Mumbai
U.S. remained silent on 
terrorist warning
Young and in charge
With approval rat-ings dropping faster than the 
Gators’ credibility on the football field, the com-
mander in chief refuses to 
give up on the people who helped elect him.
In his last push in the two 
weeks before the midterm elections, Obama is travel-ing the country to reach out to three important groups in particular (black, women 
and college-aged voters) to 
tell them the truth they all need to hear: Vote or die. 
As all of us belong to at 
least one of these special groups (and perhaps to all three) — we all owe it to our main man in the fancy pants in Washington to do 
our part and vote.
Maybe you like the way 
things are headed. Maybe 
you’re a bit peeved. 
And maybe, just maybe, 
you’ve heard you won’t be allowed to eat unless you get an “I voted” sticker in this election either.
Regardless of where we 
stand on the political field, we’re glad Obama recog-
nizes the force students can 
have in an election. And we also recognize the sad-but-true notion many of you won’t take the president’s advice and vote. We’re sad-dened many of you won’t recognize the power col-lege students have over the 
outcome of an election. 
Apathy lies at the fore-
front of failure, so let’s at 
least have a reason to be grouchy if things don’t go as we planned this election cycle. With Election Day about two weeks away, we hope you’re excited as we 
are. 
We’re sorry we can’t 
make our own plays in The 
Swamp, but use that gor -
geous voice you all have. Be your own playmaker. Vote.

Despite criticism, Gators are still a

What I hope isn’t true might be. Al-

weekend, there were two specific drives 
that caught my attention – the first two

ing our defeat against Mississippi State was that our first two drives were strictly 
passing plays. 
That’s what the fans were asking for, 
and that’s what Addazio gave us but with 
no success.
John Brantley took numerous hits and 
made several bad decisions. 
Then everyone changed their mindset, 
and from Section 33 chants of “We want 
Burton” arose. 
I can only hope Addazio didn’t decide 
to use Brantley as a scapegoat to save his 
own job.
 We may not have our Harvin-Hernan-
dez-Cooper combination anymore but to say our lack of playmakers is the reason 
for conservative play calling is extrane-ous. 
It is clear Addazio is conservative with 
his play calling.
But it will blow my mind to think Add-
azio altered our offensive scheme just to 
please fans and highlight the sub-par skills Brantley possesses. 
People should always stand by their 
work, successful or not.  
Florida football is rebuilding, but we 
are still a recruiting powerhouse, and I know we have players who can make big plays happen. 
I just hope Addazio’s stunt in the first 
quarter was to try and develop young tal-ent rather than throw Brantley under the bus of critical Gator fans.

� � �
HIV affects everyone — not just the 
individuals  who are infected with the illness
Imagine one of your best friends was 
tested for HIV , and the test comes back 
positive. 
Your friend has HIV and will have it 
the rest of his or her life. As a friend, you would be there to sup-
port him no matter what, right? 
You would help that person through all 
the pain and suffering he encounters, not to mention the embarrassment that seems to come from telling people you have HIV , 
because that’s what friends do for each 
other, right? 
Now imagine this: A stranger you have 
no ties to is diagnosed with HIV . 
Regardless of what kind of person he or 
she is, this person somehow contracted the virus. 
While you may not know the person 
and may not feel strongly about showing 
him or her support, he or she is still a hu-
man being. 
Regardless of someone’s habits or life 
choices, no one deserves contracting a life-long disease any more than your friend 
does.
Think about Ryan White. 
In 1984, at the age of 13, White was di-
agnosed with HIV because of an infected 
blood transfusion he received for his he-
mophilia. 
Did he deserve to get HIV? I hope most 
of us would say, “no.” 
So then why do most of us place blame 
and a social stigma on HIV-infected peo-ple? 
If a friend had HIV , we wouldn’t be 
afraid he or she was trying to transmit it to us. 
This friend would need to actively try 
to give you the virus for you to contract 
it. 
We now know after years of research 
we can’t simply “catch” the disease simply 
by having a conversation with an infected individual. 
So why do we feel afraid of just talking 
to a stranger with HIV? 
Society and the media can often make 
us fear HIV-infected people. 
We still treat these people with disre-
spect and contempt – as if HIV-infected people don’t have enough burdens to deal with. 
Next time you meet someone with 
HIV or hear something about the dis-ease, remember — it could be any of your friends.
 Remember that you don’t know ex-
actly how that person got HIV and you shouldn’t assume how they did. 
HIV doesn’t discriminate. Neither 
should you.

8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2010
Cheers and Tears
As part of the weekend’s Homecoming activities, an estimated 100,000 people lined 
University Avenue on Friday for the Homecoming parade. The parade featured 150 floats, including members of the UF Surf Club dressed as pirates. On Friday night, 35,000 people attended Gator Growl, at which Albert the Alligator was a guest DJ and Charly Hillman and Marcus Dixon were named homecoming queen and king. The Flor -
ida football team lost its homecoming game Saturday night to Mississippi State 10-7.

TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT GATORS IN THE NFL alligatorSports.orgHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF coach Mary Wise became the 16th Division I coach to win 700 matches 
when the Gators beat the Bulldogs on Sunday.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
Sunday’s match was not the best display of 
volleyball by the Gators this season.
Nevertheless, No. 1 Florida (16-1, 9-0 South-
eastern Conference) took care of business, de-
feating Georgia 3-1 (19-25, 25-20, 25-19, 25-21) 
in the O’Connell Center.
The win was the 700th of coach Mary Wise’s 
career. She is the 16th Division I coach to reach 
the plateau.
“It gives us a chance to say  ‘thank you’ to 
all those players and their families for choos-ing Florida, coming here and playing and be-
ing a part of this program,” Wise said. “If it gives us a chance to take a timeout and thank all of the players, all of the assistant coaches and the support staff, then it’s worth coming 
up with that number.”
The Gators started slow against the Bull-
dogs (11-10, 3-7 SEC), hitting just .172 com-pared to their rival’s .344 in the opening set 
— Florida’s first set dropped in the last four matches. 
In the final three sets, the Gators improved, 
hitting .286, .360 and .324, respectively. They ended the day with a .284 hitting percentage. Meanwhile, Georgia was held to just .130, .188 and .281 in the remaining sets to hit .244 in the match.
“I thought it was a really well-played match 
on the part of Georgia,” Wise said. “They were so low-error, especially in set one. They didn’t give away points, we never got into a good rhythm and I felt like we were a step behind defensively, really, until the middle of the sec-ond set. 
“I think that was so evident by how few 
blocks we had in the first set and a half.”
After the Gators recorded just two blocks in 
the first set, they improved as the match went on to finish with 14. 
Middle blockers Lauren Bledsoe and Cas-
sandra Anderson racked up five and seven 
blocks, respectively.
Bledsoe notched 11 kills on only 14 total at-
tacks to hit a team-high .786 while Anderson 
recorded seven kills and hit .417.
“The fact that we got 18 kills out of our 
middle and that’s just a little bit behind the 22 
of our left sides was impressive,” Wise said. 
“Credit the setters because they did a great job of getting them the ball.”
Setter Kelly Murphy and outside hitter Cal-
lie Rivers did a little bit of everything for the 
Gators on Sunday. Murphy tallied 11 kills, 30 
assists, seven digs and five blocks. While Riv-ers finished with 10 kills, eight digs and four blocks.Florida defeats Georgia, Wise 
picks up 700th career win
Well, there’s really no other way to 
put it.
Florida sucks.
The Gators have been a frustrating puzzle 
to try and figure out this year, but Saturday night’s loss to Mississippi State (read those last six words again) exposed the answer. 
They just aren’t good.
It might sound harsh, and surely no play-
er would want to hear it, but deep down, 
there’s no way they could argue otherwise.
The loss bounced Florida from the AP 
poll for the first time under Urban Meyer. The Gators didn’t even receive one vote, something Kentucky, Air Force and East Carolina managed.
Until now, Meyer had never been beaten 
three times in a row. And this is the first time 
Florida has lost at home in consecutive Sat-
urdays since 1979, meaning we are witness-ing a peak of suckage, unless things some -
how get worse.
True, there are excuses for the sucking. 
Injuries have certainly played a role. At one point this weekend, the Gators were without all three tailbacks and hybrid receiver An-dre Debose, leaving an already struggling 
offense even more toothless. And kicker 
Caleb Sturgis’ absence is looming larger and larger.But, as the saying 
goes, if it looks like a duck, swims like a 
duck and quacks like 
a duck, it probably is a duck.
In this case, if you 
lose to Mississippi State, 10-7, on home-coming, against a team that threw just 
one pass in the second half and ran the ball 
24 times in a row, you suck.
Luckily for Florida, most teams suck this 
year. South Carolina couldn’t handle Ken-tucky a week after toppling No. 1 Alabama, 
leaving the door open for the Gators to win the Southeastern Conference East if they 
win out.
Do that, and they could still end up with 
an SEC title and playing in a BCS bowl 
game.
Then again, with the way they’ve looked 
lately, a loss to Appalachian State and an appearance in the Franklin American Mort-gage Music City Bowl or AutoZone Liberty Bowl are still on the table as well.
What will make the difference? Sure, offensive coordinator Steve Add-

As bad as Florida has been in 
its last three games, the Gators 
still control whether they play in 
Atlanta for the SEC Champion-ship at the end of the season. 
UF hasn’t lost to an SEC East 
team and South Carolina was upset by Kentucky on Saturday, meaning every team on Florida’s side of the conference has at least two conference losses. 
The bye week comes at a per -
fect time for the Gators, who will have 13 days to prepare for Geor -
gia and rest injured players. 
Meyer didn’t rule out a ma-
jor overhaul of UF’s offense, but said the most pressing issue is the team’s health. “Obviously, we have to get a lot better,” Meyer 
said. “When you’re dealing with 
health issues, that’s part of it.”
Wide receiver Omarius Hines 
moved to running back, led the 
team in rushing yards (58) and 
scored the team’s only touch-down from 5 yards out on an option pitch from freshman Trey Burton. 
Running backs Jeff Demps, 
Mike Gillislee and Emmanuel Moody are all battling injuries, which Meyer said led to the use 
of Hines and true freshman wide 
receiver Robert Clark out of the backfield. 
Meyer also planned to expand 
wide receiver Andre Debose’s 
role in the of-fense, but the redshirt fresh-man went down 
with a sprained 
ankle on a first-quarter kick re-turn.  
Punter Chas 
Henry, who leads the nation in average net yards per punt, missed two field goals, includ-ing the game-tying attempt from 
42 yards away with nine seconds 
left. 
Henry is now 2 for 5 since tak-
ing over the kicking duties for an injured Caleb Sturgis (back) and 
was given more responsibility 
when kickoff specialist Brad Phil-lips left Saturday’s game with an injury. 
“That’s a lot of pressure for 
Chas,” Burton said. “That’s not his position. Make it, miss it or hit the goal post, we’re still there for him. It’s tough.”
Finger pointing won’t turn 
UF’s season around. 
The Gators know they can’t 
get back to Atlanta individually. 
“I told a couple of the offen-
sive guys, told Trey and (quar -
terback John) Brantley and Carl Moore, I’m behind them 100 per -
cent,” said safety Ahmad Black, 
who led the team with 10 tackles. 
“I’m their biggest  fan. So as long as they support me, I support them.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2010

BlackWith injuries derailing Florida’s normal ball carriers, Hines shifted to 
the Gators’ backfield for the first time in his career. The converted receiver was successful on the ground in limited chances earlier this season, and coach Urban Meyer said last week that Hines needed the ball in his hands more. The sophomore thrived on the option, taking pitches on 31-, 12- and 5-yard runs, the latter carry ending across the goal line.
6 carries, 58 yards
Tim Tebow’s ability to provide a dual-threat option behind center has been missed. But Burton has done a solid job trying to fill that void. He played a vital part in UF’s only scoring drive of the night against Mississippi State as Burton ran for 24 yards on three carries on the 13-play drive. He also helped facilitate the touchdown by pitching the ball to Hines on an option that ended in the end zone.

wishes everyone would stop whining. It’s still great to be a 
Florida Gator!
And it’s safe to say that’s the worst loss in the Urban 
Meyer era.
The Gators are mortal. Who knew.
Steve Addazio, you are the suckiest suck that ever sucked.
We still love you, Chas Henry. Not your fault the offense 
could only muster one touchdown.
FI-RE ADDAZIO clap clap clap-clap-clapLosing to Mississippii State at home on HOMECOMING weekend? 
2010 Gator Football is a 12 game case study on how to fail at life.
The title of best team in Florida is looking like a race to the 
bottom.Heard at Gator game: “I’d rather watch the wnba than our offense.”
How the f#(€ do we still control our own destiny in the SEC East?
so it’s looks like i missed nothing working tonight.....i might be the 
luckiest gator in the world right now....not having to watch what 
happened.....i can erase my dvr
“...ofﬁ  cially a losing streak!”
Prior to tonight, Mississippi State had not won on Florida Field since 
1965. Yup...That. Just. Happened.
FSU, what do you normally do in these situations? Miami 
feel free to chime in.
say goodbye to being ranked Gators. hopefully say 
goodbye to Steve Addazio too7 points?! Are you kidding me? That was our worst offensive performance in forty - hmmm, that was our worst offensive 
performance since Alabama 2 weeks ago! Something had to change!
A loss to Mississippi St. got Ron Zook ﬁ  red, and it changed Florida’s 
program for the better. Hopefully the same is true for Steve Addazio.
Cam Newton stealing a laptop, writing his name on it, 
and throwing it out the window was a better QB play than anything Brantley has done all season. BAM!
I’m on the bandwagon now. Please god ﬁ  re steve addazio and let Brantley f***ing throw the ball. Get a ﬁ  eld goal kicker who isn’t the punter and get back to the basics of the spread offense which made us great. John Brantley is just as good as Chris Leak and Leak won a title in 06-07 with Tebow (Burton) as his backup. Dan Mullen has no 
business winning a game in the swamp with that s*** team.I feel bad for Chas and maybe even worse for Burton, who 
played his heart out and didn’t get to make plays when the chips were down despite being the whole offense today.So, I had previously come to terms that the Gators weren’t good. Fine. I didn’t realize we sucked this bad. Addazio needs to go, Deonte needs to learn to catch, Demps needs to hold the ball, and Brantley has to play smart.
For sale: offensive coordinator/offensive line coach. Works 
great! Your QB will be protected and get many yards!
So, this is what it’s like being a bad team
 crap. we’re gonna lose to bye week now arent we...

Mississippi State quarterback Chris Relf runs with the ball during the Gators’ 10-7 homecoming loss 
to the Bulldogs in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Saturday night.
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Omarius Hines’ 5-yard touch-
down run late in the third quarter 
Saturday night ignited not only a struggling Gators offense but also a 
stadium of frustrated fans.
Unfortunately for Florida and its 
followers, Mississippi State’s run-
heavy attack methodically took the 
air out of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
The Bulldogs held the ball 
for about 10 minutes on a pair of 
fourth-quarter drives. Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen, the former Florida offensive coordinator un-
der coach Urban Meyer, called 16 
running plays on those two drives, 
and his unit pounded the Gators’ 
front seven, gaining 92 yards on the 
ground.
On the only nonrunning play, tail-
back Vick Ballard received a shovel 
pass and lost 5 yards.
“It’s too much,” UF defensive 
coordinator Teryl Austin said of the 
Bulldogs’ ability to pound the ball. 
“One of the things we really want 
to do is stop the run. We have to go 
back as coaches and look at what we can do better to get our guys in better position.”
For the most part, Mississippi 
State’s offense revolved around Bal-lard, who gained 53 yards on 10 
touches during those two late drives. 
And the Bulldogs avoided third downs with effective early runs, av-eraging 8.5 yards on eight first-down carries.
Although he said he could not 
make a proper assessment of his de-fense until watching replays, Austin 
said his players were not wrapping 
up the ball carrier.
“We got in there, we’d make 
a couple hits and all of a sudden it 
would get kind of jumbled up in 
there,” he said. “All of a sudden, the back would squirt through.”
Meyer pointed to his defense’s in-
ability to contain quarterback Chris Relf, but the dual-threat player was 
limited to just 14 yards on five fourth-
quarter carries.
Relf was also ineffective through 
the air, completing four of nine 
throws for just 33 yards, 30 of which 
came on a strike to Chad Bumphis. How-ever, the 6-foot-4, 
240-pound Relf was 
successful early, pick-
ing up 82 yards on the 
ground and scoring a first-quarter touchdown on a 6-yard run.
Because of Florida’s recent strug-
gles against running quarterbacks, 
Meyer, whose team thrived for years with Tim Tebow on the move, has been fed a dose of his own medicine.
“A lot of it is (the Bulldogs) take 
that big quarterback and run right behind that offensive line,” Meyer 
said. “They find ways to (find mis-
matches). And that’s hard to stop. You’ve seen it around here for a while.”Bulldogs use running game to control clock, game
azio could be fired, perhaps even sacrificed to a pit of live 
alligators on campus. But that won’t fix the problem.
Florida has a lot of holes and a bunch of pegs that are 
either too square or too small to fill them. 
The offense has to be changed to suit John Brantley’s 
strengths, and he has to take control and stop, as he likes to say, “taking what the defense gives him.”
Short-yardage and red-zone solutions have to be found 
— fast — because an end-around to Robert Clark is not the answer to the question: “What’s the best way to gain a yard on 4th and 1?”And the offensive line needs to start playing like the vet-
eran unit everyone expected.
Those are problems that stem from execution, not just 
game-planning.
Blame Addazio all you want, but this is a team effort.Maybe Addazio didn’t make all the right play calls. May-
be he didn’t make any good calls.
But that doesn’t matter when the blockers, catchers, run-
ners and throwers don’t block, catch, run or throw well.
Make no mistake, lots of people pitched in.Special teams lent a hand by missing two field goals and 
being penalized on two first-quarter kick returns.
The offense did its part by being shut out through half-time at home for the first time since 2007, amassing 17 first-half rushing yards and coming away with just 7 points on 
three red-zone trips. Once again, no one made the big play 
to swing momentum.
The defense contributed by, well, not intercepting that 
one second-half shovel pass and returning it for a touch-
down, I guess. As safety Ahmad Black said, “We gave up 
10 points,” and there isn’t much more that unit could have done.
Times are bad in Gainesville right now, but somehow, 
the season isn’t lost yet.
The Gators’ goals are still ahead of them, but only if the 
sucking stops here.MIKE , from page 13FootballBy JESSE SIMONTON

Saturday night the Florida foot-
ball team sent Gators fans into a 
panic. On Sunday afternoon the oth-
er football team nearly gave the rest 
of the Gators fans a heart attack.
No. 13 Florida (12-2-2, 6-1-1 
Southeastern Conference) defeated No. 21 Georgia 2-1 in overtime., 
sending the crowd into a frenzy af-
ter watching the Gators overcome an early 1-0 deficit. 
Sophomore Erika Tymrak was 
the hero, scoring both goals for the Gators — the equalizer coming with just nine minutes left in the match. Florida’s top playmaker created chance after chance late in the sec-ond half, but the Gators failed to find the net, frustrating those in at-tendance. 
However, in the 82nd minute 
Tymrak wiggled 30 yards down the middle of the Bulldogs’ defense and drilled a shot underneath the outstretched arms of Georgia goalie Ashley Baker.
The goal was just the second 
Baker had allowed in SEC play , and it ended her streak of 561 scoreless minutes. Earlier in the match, Baker 
stopped two key one-on-one oppor -
tunities and was bailed out when a 
goal was taken away because of an error by the referee.“I never thought it was going to 
be one of those days,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “I knew that we were going to get the equalizer. It remind-ed me of the U.S.’s World Cup game this summer. It was coming, it was just a matter of time.”
Tymrak scored the golden goal seven minutes into overtime with a rip 25 yards out, nailing the upper 90 of the back post. 
“[Assistant coach Victor Camp-bell] told me to ‘just gamble and take a shot,’ and when I shot it I had a feeling it was going in,” Tymrak said.
While Tymrak’s heroics saved 
the game for Florida, defensive mis-cues plagued the Gators and nearly 
cost them an important conference 
victory . 
Florida struggled with distribu-
tion and discipline in the first half. Georgia (9-3-4, 4-1-3 SEC) pressured UF’s defenders, taking six shots off Gators turnovers. In the 12th min-ute, the Bulldogs took the lead when Jazmyne Avant misplayed a ball 
deep in Florida territory , allowing 
Laura Eddy to sweep in and score the goal. 
The Gators made several tackles 
to thwart Bulldogs opportunities following defensive lapses.
“Some of those problems have to 
be attributed to us coaches because we try to play out of every situa-
tion and we don’t want to just kick 
it,” Burleigh said. “Sometimes we take too much risk in our defensive third.” 
The abundant amount of turn-
overs left fans and commentators so weary of another miscue goal that Matthew Stubbington, the Gators’ radio soccer commentator, joked, 
“You can soak up these errors like  
a sponge for so long until you start leaking water.”16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 2010
