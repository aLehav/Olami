NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Three 
minutes and 41 seconds.
Leon Orr was scheduled to enter 
Saturday night’s matchup against 
Vanderbilt during the Commo-
dores’ second offensive series of the 
game. 
That drive started just three min-
utes and 41 seconds after kickoff.
For Orr, ﬁ  nishing out his ﬁ  fth 
year with the Florida Gators foot-ball program wasn’t worth waiting on the sideline for three minutes and 41 seconds. 
For Orr, enduring a 12-hour bus 
ride back to Gainesville alone was more appealing than sitting out for the contest’s ﬁ  rst three minutes and 41 seconds.
Today, the 6-foot-5, 305-pound 
defensive lineman doesn’t have to be told to come off the bench. He doesn’t have to watch Jon Bullard 
take ﬁ  rst-team reps over him, put 
up with the coaching staff’s deci-sions or be a team player.
In return, Will Muschamp doesn’t have to give Leon Orr a spot on the squad.
“Guys aren’t going to put them-
selves above the team,” Muschamp 
said.
“Not here.”

The Gators don’t need Orr to 
win football games. They proved 
it last week in a 38-20 rout of Geor-gia and once again Saturday after a dominant 34-10 victory over Van-derbilt on the road.
Since Orr was hampered with a 
knee injury earlier this season, Mus-champ leaned heavily on backup Jon Bullard and found that the de-fensive line actually became more versatile without Orr in the lineup.
“We’re more athletic with Jon 
Bullard inside,” Muschamp said.
The numbers back up Mus-
champ’s statement.
Bullard, a 6-foot-3, 270-pound ju-
nior, has been one of Florida’s best pass rushers as of late, recording 11 total tackles and one tackle for loss during these past two weeks.

Joshua Price sat behind his scrap 
metal art booth — a steel animal zoo 
— nearly bouncing with joy Sunday afternoon.
His booth’s ﬁ  rst appearance at 
Gainesville’s 33rd annual Downtown Festival & Art Show was met with a sea of passers-by who stopped to peer between the metal jaws of Price’s most popular scrap metal anglerﬁ  sh.
The pieces — 205 in all — are made 
from materials collected at yard sales or donated from friends. Among those on display at Price’s booth were frogs 
with fork feet, owls with clock bel-
lies and birds with silver butter knife wings.
“People don’t drop cats off at our 
house,” said his wife, Tiffany, laugh-ing. “They drop off boxes of garbage.”
Meanwhile, her husband was 
wrapped up in the moment. As the trafﬁ  c at his booth continued to ﬂ  ow, Tiffany, 34, said Joshua, 39, fed off the compliments on his art.
The Price booth was just one in 
a sea of more than 250 vendors posi-tioned between City Hall and the Hip-podrome State Theatre who came in from across the country for the two-day event, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on 
Saturday and Sunday.
More than 100,000 people crowded 
the streets, many walking their dogs 
and holding the hands of children wearing handmade crowns.
In an intersection near Bo Diddley 
Community Plaza, two chubby corgis drew a crowd when their leashes got tangled during their excitement at see-

Timothy Kline doesn’t have to worry 
about paying for college in Florida, which 
was deemed the most veteran-friendly 
state in the country by Florida TaxWatch on 
Thursday.
The 25-year-old UF telecommunica-
tion senior has served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command for six years. Now, he receives assistance from the state’s GI Bill, which was passed earlier this year. It cov-ers his tuition, housing and a portion of his 
textbooks.
“It means a lot to have a country to come 
back to that’s so grateful for the people who 
sacriﬁ  ce so much,” he said.
The GI Bill provides veterans with edu-
cation and employment assistance, as well as tax exemptions, according to Florida Tax-Watch, a nonproﬁ  t, nonpartisan research institute.
Home to more than 1.6 million veterans, 
Florida has the third-largest military vet-eran population in the nation, according to 
a press release. Some of these veterans need 
assistance from state programs.
Maximiliano Cruz, a UF mathematics 
junior, has been in UF’s Army ROTC pro-gram for three years. 
The 20-year-old said he hopes to serve 
active duty in the U.S. Army for 20 years and then enjoy the beneﬁ  ts when he re-tires.
“These veteran programs can help them 
get their feet on the ground,” he said.Fla. named most veteran-friendly,

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Saturday evening after 
police said he punched his girlfriend of 20 years in the face and tried to drag her out-side.
Shortly before 6 p.m., 52-
year-old David Wayne Walker and his on-and-off girlfriend began arguing. Walker, trying to force the woman to leave, began tugging at her clothes, a Gainesville Police report said.
He then grabbed the wom-
an’s purse and started walking toward the front door at 3939 NE First Terrace. The woman tried to grab her purse, result-ing in the two crashing into a coffee table and breaking a lamp.
While on the ground, 
Walker hit the woman over 
the head with her purse and 
punched her in the face over and over before trying to drag her out the door by her clothes, 
according to the report. Police 
said the woman had a bloody 
mouth, along with cuts and a swollen upper lip. There were drops of blood leading from the kitchen to the living room.
When the fight got violent, 
witnesses stepped in to break it up. Walker then got in his car and drove away.
Police later found an intox-
icated Walker in the kitchen of 1904 SE Third Ave. Police said he was being loud and aggres-sive while swinging his arms around in an effort to avoid being arrested. It took four officers and a K-9 to get him handcuffed.
Walker was arrested on 
charges of attempted robbery, battery and resisting an officer with violence. His bond is set at $75,000.

A homeless man was ar-
rested Saturday afternoon af-ter police said he kicked down the door to his ex-girlfriend’s home and slammed her head on the wall and floor.
Darian Denard Holmes, 
45, stole his ex-girlfriend’s cell phone shortly before 6 p.m., a report said. When the woman, whom Holmes has two children with, confronted him about her phone, a verbal argument broke out. She then went inside the residence and locked the door.
Walker proceeded to kick 
down the locked door and at-tack the woman, a report said. He kicked a hole in a televi-sion, grabbed the woman by her hair and hit her head 
against the floor and ground.
When the woman tried to 
call police, Holmes knocked 
the phone out of her hand.
The woman then ran up-
stairs. Holmes followed and continued to beat her and pull her hair. The woman was eventually able to call police, who said she had injuries on her right eye, along with a bruised arm and scratches.
Holmes was arrested on 
charges of theft, criminal mischief, battery, depriving someone of contacting 911, aggravated assault and bur-glary. His bond is currently set at $320,000.Police roundup:

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Former 
President George W. Bush is giv-
ing even odds about whether an-
other Bush will try to occupy the 
White House.
Brother Jeb, a former Florida 
governor, is “wrestling with the 
decision” of running for the Re-
publican nomination for presi-dent in 2016, George W. Bush says.
“I think it’s 50-50,” the former 
president told CBS’ “Face the Na-tion.”
“He and I are very close. On 
the other hand, he’s not here 
knocking on my door, you know, agonizing about 
the decision. He 
knows exactly, 
you know, the 
r a m i f i c a t i o n s on family, for example. He’s seen his dad and 
his brother go 
through the presidency. I’d give 
it a tossup.”
The former president was 
more conservative in his estimate than another family member. Jeb Bush’s son George P. Bush said two weeks ago it was more likely than not that the former Florida 
governor would move forward.
George W. Bush is promot-ing “41,” a book about his father, 
former President George H.W. Bush.
“One of the lessons you learn 
from George H.W. Bush is that you can go into politics and still be a good father,” George W. Bush said when asked if it’s worth put-
ting a family through a presiden-
tial campaign. “I put our family through it,” he responded.
George W. Bush said he would 
be “all in” for his brother if he 
decides to run for the office and 
would do whatever he asks, even if it’s to stay behind the scenes. As for their mother’s position 
that enough Bushes have run for 
president, he said, “Sometimes her prognostications haven’t been very accurate.”Bush gives 50-50 odds of Jeb running

AMERICANS RELEASED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SEATTLE — Kenneth Bae 
arrived home after years of 
imprisonment in North Korea, expressing his gratitude to the U.S. government for securing 
his release and revealing that 
his time there offered lessons.
His sister said he had one 
stipulation for his first meal back home: No Korean food.
“He said, ‘I don’t want Ko-
rean food; that’s all I’ve been eating for the last two years,’” Terri Chung said Sunday out-
side her Seattle church. “We 
had a late night eating pizza.”
Bae and Matthew Miller, 
another American who had been held captive in North Ko-rea, landed Saturday night at a Washington state military base after a top U.S. intelligence of-ficial secured their release.
“It’s been an amazing two 
years, I learned a lot, I grew a lot, I lost a lot of weight,” Bae, a Korean-American missionary with health problems, said at Joint Base Lewis-McChord Sat-urday night. Asked how he was feeling, he said, “I’m recovering at this time.”
Bae, surrounded by fam-
ily members, spoke briefly to the media after the plane car-rying him and Miller landed. He thanked President Barack Obama and the people who supported him and his family. He also thanked the North Ko-rean government for releasing 
him.
“I just want to say thank 
you all for supporting me and 
standing by me,” Bae said. His family has said he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liv-er problems and back pain.
Chung said Bae was in bet-
ter shape when he arrived than 
his family expected. She said he 
had spent about six weeks in a North Korean hospital before he returned.
“That helped. As you know, 
he had gone back and forth be-tween the labor camp and hos-pital,” she said.
She said he was checked out 
by a doctor on the flight back to the U.S.
His plans for the near fu-
ture include rest and food and reconnecting with friends and family. Neither his wife nor his children could make it back to Seattle in time for Bae’s home-coming, his sister said.
“They plan to gather the 
whole family together for Thanksgiving,” she said.
Members of Bae’s family, 
who live near the sprawling military base south of Seattle, had met him when he landed. His mother hugged him after he got off the plane. Miller stepped off the U.S. government aircraft a short time later and also was greeted with hugs.
U.S. officials said Miller of 
Bakersfield, California, and Bae of Lynnwood, Washington, flew back with James Clap-per, the director of national intelligence. Clapper was the highest-ranking American to visit Pyongyang in more than a decade.
Their release was the latest 
twist in the fitful relationship between the Obama adminis-tration and the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, whose approach to the U.S. has shifted back and forth from defiance to occasional concilia-tion.
Bae was serving a 15-year 
sentence for alleged anti-gov-ernment activities. He was de-tained in 2012 while leading a tour group to a North Korean economic zone.
Miller was serving a six-year 
jail term on charges of espio-nage after he allegedly ripped 
up his tourist visa at Pyong-
yang’s airport in April and de-manded asylum. North Korea said Miller had wanted to expe-rience prison life so he could se-cretly investigate the country’s human rights situation.

President-elect Kent Fuchs will earn twice 
as much as Florida State University President-
elect John Thrasher.
The Florida Board of Governors approved 
both Fuchs and Thrasher on Thursday.
Fuchs’ 5 1/2 -year contract to serve as the 
new UF president will include an $860,000 base salary. Meanwhile, Thrasher will earn a base salary of $430,000, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Fuchs’ salary could rank him among the highest-paid public university chief executives.
The top executive from 2012 to 2013 was E. 
Gordon Gee from Ohio State University, with a compensation of $6,057,615, according to 
The Chronicle for Higher Education.
Fuchs, who will remain the Cornell provost 
until Nov. 14, will make more than Cornell’s 
president, who earned $854,082 in 2010, ac-cording to the Cornell Daily Sun.
In 2008, UF President Bernie Machen re-ceived a base salary of $415,000 and $285,000 in an-nual performance bonuses, according to Alligator ar-chives. Machen’s total sal-
ary in 2013 was $720, 594.
Once Machen leaves, 
Fuchs will move into the $5 
million president’s house located on West University 
Avenue.  
Fuchs will make more than Florida A&M 
University President Elmira Mangum, who receives a $425,000 base salary, while Florida 
Atlantic University President John Kelly se-
cures a $400,000 base salary, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Fuchs will work full time as president. 
However, once his contract ends, he will be granted tenure as a professor in the College of Engineering’s department of electrical and 
computer engineering.
Fuchs has known about the university since 
he was in high school in South Florida.
“The opportunity of being at a spectacular 
university was just irresistible,” he said in a UF 
video.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said Fuchs 
will begin as president in January, the middle of the 2014-2015 fiscal year. His contract, writ-
ten to reflect this, will end at the close of the 
2019-2020 fiscal year.Fuchs to be among highest-paid public university presidents

Adobe Creative Suite may be 
within reach on a college-student 
budget.
UF Information Technology is 
offering a free Adobe pilot to 4,000 
students through UFApps until Feb. 
15.
Students can stop by the Hub to 
create their UFApps Adobe pilot ac-count to access the Adobe Creative Cloud, said Tracy Gale, communi-cations manager for UFIT.
“We are doing this pilot — right 
now it’s free, so we can gauge the in-
terest of our students,” Gale said.
At the end of February, UF senior 
IT staff will evaluate usage and de-
cide whether to continue the Adobe program within UFApps. If so, they will set a discounted monthly price point for continued student access.
“At this time, we do not have 
details on what that price point will be, but the price point will be less expensive than Adobe’s monthly 
student pricing for Creative Cloud 
access,” Gale said.
The current Adobe student pric-
ing structure includes a first-year enrollment pricing of $19.99 per month, which increases to $29.99 per month in the second year.
The price point will depend on 
how many students are interested. UFIT is hoping to see 4,000 students register, the maximum allotted un-der the pilot.
When UFApps originally 
launched in June 2014, UFIT wanted to include Adobe products, but the current license did not allow it.
“There were restrictions from 
Adobe how long we can offer this pilot,” Gale said. “There’s a lot of structure in place by Adobe that we have to comply with.”
Because Adobe would be in 
UFApps, which is in the Cloud, it would update automatically. Stu-dents would log into the most up-to-date version for no extra fee. The other 40 types of software, including PDF Editor, Serif Design Suite and AutoCAD 2014, offered through UFApps will remain free, Gale said.
Additional hardware will be 
installed during Winter Break to provide faster performance and en-hance the Adobe user experience, she said.
Fifty students have registered for 
the soft launch since Nov. 6.
Telecommunication sophomore 
Alexis Levy, 19, went to the Help Desk after hearing about the free tri-
al through a post on the Journalism 
and Communications Ambassadors program’s Facebook group page. The process took about 20 minutes. 
“I’m really happy with it,” she 
said. “I’m happy to have free access to the same features on my com-puter that I’d have access to in the computer labs on campus.”
Gale said UF got approved for 
the trial the week before the soft launch and immediately linked se-nior technical staff to Adobe and got student testers at the Help Desk.
“This is really happening in real 
time,” Gale said. “Once we got the word that we could do this, we put it in motion to make it happen. So 
a lot of the details, we haven’t final-
ized.” Adobe programs now free on UFApps
“We are doing this pilot 
— right now it’s free, so we 
can gauge the interest of 
our students.”

UPHAM, N.M.  — State ofﬁ  cials have vowed 
to push on to ensure Spaceport America becomes 
a success, despite a recent tragedy that has delayed commercial space ﬂ  ights by Virgin Galactic, the an-chor tenant at the taxpayer-ﬁ  nanced spaceport in 
southern New Mexico.
The New Mexico Spaceport Authority is de-
veloping a plan that includes hiring more staff to 
boost marketing efforts aimed at diversifying the spaceport’s client base. Christine Anderson, the au-thority’s executive director, told the Albuquerque Journal and the Las Cruces Sun-News that it’s im-portant to remember that it’s not the Virgin Galactic Spaceport but rather Spaceport America.
“Up to now, we were focused on building the 
spaceport, which was a humongous task,” she said, acknowledging that it was designed around Virgin Galactic’s needs. “We have to now adjust our busi-ness strategies.”
Speculation about the future has been swirling 
in the wake of Virgin Galactic’s spaceship break-ing up over the California desert during a test ﬂ  ight Oct. 31. One pilot was killed; another was injured.
While it could be at least six months before the 
space tourism company resumes tests ﬂ  ights, it’s unclear how soon commercial ﬂ  ights could begin from the spaceport. And the longer it takes Virgin Galactic to launch operations in New Mexico, the more pressure builds on the spaceport authority to 
generate revenue needed to keep the facility open.
Anderson said during a legislative meeting the 
day before Virgin Galactic’s testing mishap that the spaceport would face a $1.5 million budget shortfall 
starting in July if Virgin Galactic didn’t start ﬂ  ying next year. That shortfall is expected to be more now that the company will likely not ﬂ  y during the 2016 
ﬁ  scal year, Anderson said.
Some possibilities to ensure the spaceport’s 
economic viability range from concerts and photo 
shoots to aircraft testing. But Anderson has declined to name any potential customers, saying talks are ongoing with at least a handful of companies.
Even before the Virgin Galactic incident, indus-
try experts said New Mexico had done little to re-cruit more space companies, thus turning the $219 
million spaceport into a one-trick pony tied to the 
fortunes of Virgin Galactic. UP Aerospace has been ﬂ  ying rockets to suborbit from Spaceport Amer-ica’s vertical launch pad since 2006, but president and CEO Jerry Larson said the spaceport’s business plan has been “too narrow” from the start.
“They’re focused on one tenant and one type of 
launch method,” Larson said, referring to Virgin’s strategy of horizontally launching on the runway.
That strategy began almost a decade ago under 
then-Governor Bill Richardson’s administration. Now, the spaceport authority expects to request capital outlay funds in the next legislative session to build more hangars and to further develop infra-structure at the vertical launch pad.
But New Mexico has already lost ground to 
other spaceports in Texas, California and Florida as competition increases in the commercial space industry. Nine spaceports are now licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration, and about 10 more are under construction.New Mexico working on plan to

classes?Today’s question: Are you celebrating Veterans Day? Republican victory 
despite want for less 
corporate inﬂ  uence
When Alachua County voters went to the polls Tuesday 
the focus of the media and most voters remained pri-marily on the hotly contested governor’s race and the 
proposed “Moving Alachua County Forward” transportation tax initiative.
However, voters also cast ballots on — and approved — a 
single, nonbinding proclamation by an overwhelming margin — 71.5 percent to 28.5 percent.
The ballot measure asked voters whether the U.S. Constitu-
tion should be amended to state that “only human beings, and not corporations, labor unions and other artiﬁ  cial entities, are endowed with constitutional rights” and that therefore, regulat-ing political contributions does not restrict political speech.
According to the Associated Press, the polling found that 
nearly two-thirds of voters agreed that government economic policies disproportionately favor the wealthy.
It is ironic that the same voters who widely identiﬁ  ed the 
domination of government by corporate interests as a major is-sue chose to hand the reins of power to the Republican Party. These Republicans have encouraged and welcomed the grow-ing corruption and legalized bribery manifesting within Ameri-can politics.
In Alachua County, voters re-elected Rep. Ted Yoho, a con-
gressman who has received contributions from the political ac-tion committees of some of the most powerful corporations in America. Donations to Yoho’s most recent campaign included $5,000 each from AT&T and Lockheed Martin and $7,500 from the infamous Koch Industries.
Around the country, Americans voted to give control of the 
Senate to Republicans, including soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In 2013, when Democratic senators drafted a constitutional amendment to end corporate person-
hood, McConnell called the proposal “absurd.”
The solution to the problem of money in politics is not simply 
to elect Democrats instead of Republicans. Many Democrats are 
just as beholden to special interests — whether corporations, la-bor unions or both — as Republicans. However, within the halls of American power, only Democratic lawmakers have identiﬁ  ed the growing inﬂ  uence of these special interests on public policy as a serious issue.
Fortunately, voters and lawmakers at the state level are be-
ginning to take precisely the kind of bold action that the issue of money in politics requires. State lawmakers in Vermont and California have passed resolutions calling for a constitutional convention to address the problem. Similar resolutions have received strong support in state legislatures across the country and will be voted on in the coming months and years.
Voters are frustrated with the lack of progress within Con-
gress and the executive branch on the issues that directly affect the American middle and working classes. However, as long as 
lawmakers are motivated by donations, government policies 
will continue to favor the rich and powerful over everyone else.
Supreme Court must act on gay marriage
On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati upheld decisions by Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky to 
prohibit same-sex marriage in those states. The 2-1 rul-ing comes as a surprise and goes against the recent cas-es concerning marriage equality that have been decided in recent months. By not striking down the same-sex 
marriage bans, the judges have opted to err on the side 
of discrimination and injustice.
A lot of people believe that, following this decision, 
the issue of marriage equality will once again make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Earlier this year, the Supreme Court managed to 
evade taking a deﬁ  nitive stance on the topic. Instead, they deferred to a lower court ruling that granted mar-riage equality to 11 additional states. Since then, federal 
courts have been ruling in favor of marriage equality in 
case after case, resulting in 32 states plus Washington, D.C., and St. Louis, Missouri, granting same-sex couples the freedom to marry. 
If the topic of marriage equality makes its way back 
to the Supreme Court, the justices would be doing our nation a huge favor by making the ﬁ  nal decision to implement marriage equality in all U.S. states and ter-ritories.
A Gallup poll published in May 2014 stated that 55 
percent of Americans support laws “recognizing same-sex marriages as legally valid.” In recent years, that question has been posed to respondents, and the per-centage points have been higher. The clear trend here is 
that our country is becoming more receptive to the idea 
of marriage equality for all. 
The Supreme Court would do a great disservice to 
our nation by prolonging these efforts for equality once 
again if they decided to leave the decision of whether 
to permit and recognize same-sex marriages up to indi-vidual states.Judge Martha Craig 
Daughtrey was the dissenter of the 2-1 decision. In her dis-
senting opinion, she wrote that 
same-sex marriage is not just a political issue but is instead about people — something 
many of those opposed to mar-
riage equality fail to remember 
— and that people are “suffering actual harm as a result of being denied the right to marry where they reside.”
These court rulings may just seem like lofty, abstract 
news headlines, but these decisions have real life effects on actual people. A couple’s ability to marry decides whether they can stake claim to all of the beneﬁ  ts that come with marriage.
It is unfair that heterosexual couples can reap these 
beneﬁ  ts with no contest, as if marriage is a straight-only birthright, while queer couples must ﬁ  ght for their right to marry through lengthy legal processes that cost time and money. In order for us to have a fair society, all 
members must be able to access the same beneﬁ  cial av-
enues. That includes marriage.
This isn’t just about having the right to openly love 
whomever you want. It’s about having the right to not 
be disenfranchised by society because of your identity.
The government has a duty to its citizens to protect 
us all from that disenfranchisement, and that is why the 
Supreme Court has a duty to stop beating around the bush and rule once and for all that all adults of sound 
mind and consenting age should have the right to marry 
whomever they want, regardless of sex or gender.
Leaving a decision like this in the hands of the states 
will only delay America in its journey to equality for all 
people.

Tuesday night, the Republican Par-
ty scored a major victory. They gained control of the Senate, re-
taining and increasing their lead in the House, and now 31 states will have Re-publican governors. Earlier in the year, President Barack Obama said, “I am not on the ballot this 
fall… but make no mistake: these policies are on the 
ballot. Every single one of them.” I think it’s safe to say that a majority of Americans went out Tuesday and vehemently rejected Obama’s agenda.
With that in consideration, the American people 
decided to try Republicans over Democrats for the next two years, and they expect results in a timely and efficient manner. Republicans must deliver what they promised if they wish to keep their power 
in Congress and potentially paint the White House 
red in 2016. If they fail to lead and progress, they will be voted out before they can even get settled.
For Republicans to be productive the next two 
years, they cannot ignore the fact that Obama is 
in the White House. Compromise will have to be 
made for legislation to pass, bearing in mind that Obama can veto everything and that their major-ity isn’t large enough to enact legislation on their 
own. Compromise does not equate to giving in, as 
some political pundits would like you to believe, but rather coming to the table to discuss different ideas about how to fix the problems we face and coming up with a cohesive plan that puts together 
the best parts, regardless of whether a Republican 
or a Democrat crafted it.
Republicans will be giddy and eager to imme-
diately pass legislation to defund and repeal the 
health care law, but this would be quite foolish. The 
American people don’t want to see you come into office only to repeal legislation without any backup plan.
Before going after the Affordable Care Act, Re-
publicans must have a solution of their own that addresses the concerns in America’s health care in-dustry, one that preferably won’t immediately cut off what the Affordable Care Act has enacted and 
that will slowly transition into a new, more sustain-
able plan. Any abrupt cut to the system could cause a shock to the industry that could have many unin-tended consequences. Regardless of your personal views on the Affordable Care Act, it has helped some people, and they rely upon it. It would be wrong to gut this 
legislation without a viable alterna-
tive.
Republicans must show that they are ready to get 
to work. After four years of having legislation reach 
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s desk, only to 
sit there and pile up without a discussion or vote on the Senate floor, the American people are ready to see Congress do its job. With an approval rating of just 14 percent, according to a Gallup poll, Congress 
has a lot of work to do to patch things up and show 
that it can lead. It is unfortunate that leadership will now lie with Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as he likely will not be much of an improvement over 
Reid. Hopefully, we’ll all be pleasantly surprised.
Republicans cannot be in control come January 
and simply do what their party prefers. Americans 
are tired of seeing political parties only promoting what is good for their political gain toward winning 
elections. They need to do what is right, regardless 
of whether the Republican National Committee is on board. Some decisions will be quite easy. They should pass legislation that finally allows the Key-
stone XL pipeline to be built. They should pass a 
budget that doesn’t continue to spend us into obliv-ion.
Some issues will be more difficult to confront, 
but that’s where true leadership shines. They 
should pass comprehensive immigration reform 
that actually fixes problems so we aren’t discuss-ing this 30 years later. They should look at the mess that is our tax code and not reform it, but get rid of 
it and replace it with something a little more fair. 
They should realize that we cannot continue to let education slip through the cracks, like it has done for more than 50 years.
Republicans have a real opportunity to pass 
laws that will have a positive impact on the average American’s life. They must resist the urge to pay homage to the GOP industrial complex and do what is right for all Americans.

High heels, revealing 
clothing, degradation and misguidance are 
some of the words that come to mind when the controversial 
topic of prostitution is revived.
This feeling, concerning 
individuals getting paid to 
perform sexual acts, is one mir-rored by many Americans — but it should change. Through the rise of feminist and social activist groups, our nation’s morality has certainly evolved 
through time. With each new 
breakthrough comes more and more backlash from conserva-tive communities but undeni-able support from others.
Consequently, these 
achievements have sparked the progressive movement toward more and more social and polit-
ical issues. It is no surprise that 
with the recent, morally contro-versial state-level legalization of marijuana, abortion and same-sex marriage, the legalization of our history’s oldest profes-sion, prostitution, has also been brought into question.
Standing in the way of a 
more stabilized economy — a drop in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and a de-
crease in violence and rape — is 
society’s misguided belief that prostitution is immoral.
This belief is understand-
able, and the believers cannot be blamed for the ideas of im-purity and shame, which are attached to sexuality and are the ones that have always been 
difficult to stray from.
In fact, according to the Su-
preme Court of Canada, certain 
laws restricting prostitution-related activities have actually made conditions in this profes-sion unnecessarily dangerous.
A San Francisco study found 
that 82 percent of prostitutes 
have been assaulted and 68 per-
cent have been raped. Another study found that prostitutes in Colorado Springs were 18 times more likely to be murdered than people who do not prosti-tute, clearly showing incredibly high violence surrounding sex workers.
Many of these crimes remain 
unreported because the pros-titutes themselves are afraid of 
coming forward due to their 
profession’s illegality. Legal-izing it would allow sex work-ers to take protective measures that are unavailable for them at the moment, such as hiring bodyguards or simply report-ing their assaults.
An even sadder truth about 
prostitution is that many wom-en, some of them even under-age, are brutally forced into the business by what are known as “pimps,” who act as agents 
for prostitutes and collect their 
earnings. The chase for disin-tegrating these cruel forms of rape is constant and expensive.
The closest thing to reaching 
this goal would also be legaliz-ing prostitution, primarily be-cause this way, the government would be able to regulate it and 
increase the quality of life for 
legalized sex workers through required health checkups, ulti-mately driving the illegal broth-els out of business.
If Americans do not have 
empathy for sex workers, per-haps they will care for their country’s economy. Similar to 
how marijuana is being taxed 
by state governments, prostitu-tion also has the potential to be taxed, as well as to provide jobs for both prostitutes and gov-ernment regulators.
And if time is money, the 
government’s time must be considered gold. Wasting time on never-ending investigations, arrests and prosecutions of sex workers, brothel owners and 
prostitute customers wastes 
government and tax money.
“Every hour spent on going 
after prostitution is an hour that could have been spent on going after terrorists and going after people who victimize,” said Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz to MSNBC’s Mi-
chael Smerconish.
From a social standpoint, 
keeping it illegal and prejudic-
ing them is essentially equal to slut shaming or discriminating against women solely because of their personal decisions. Politically, sex workers do not have the same rights as legally 
employed people in America, 
such as minimum wage, free-dom from discrimination and a safe work environment, jeopar-dizing the standard of living of all sex workers.
No reform comes without 
some protest, as it can be prov-en throughout history: from race riots rising upon abolish-ing slavery in 1865 to churches forming special groups against 
the legalization of same-sex 
marriage today.
The fight for what is just 
must always come with a price. The question that must be asked  isn’t “Should prostitution be le-galized?” simply because the facts prove that it should. The question must instead be: “Is 
America ready for this?”

hung upside down from rings and white fabric.
UF students Genevieve Comeau 
and Lukas Christensen, both 21, 
stood outside the Price’s booth, 
admiring a pot of metal flowers.Christensen, an electrical en-
gineering major, said he has been coming to the festival for the last four years and enjoys seeing artists come together.
“It’s local culture,” he said. “I 
think it’s important.”
“There are artists that we’ve 
seen before that we are glad to see back,” Comeau, an entomology major, said.
It gives them a chance to revisit 
past artists and buy pieces they passed up in previous years, she said.
UF landscape architecture stu-
dent Stephanie Gust, 43, was also on a return trip to the festival with her mother, Peggy Gust.
The two stood outside Port Or-
ange-native Don Kaufman’s wood and corian art booth Sunday morn-ing, admiring the 3-D photos.
From afar, the portraits of The 
Beatles, Lucille Ball and NASCAR stars looked like photos. Up close, the intricately cut white corian, a surface material harder than wood, shoots up from a black background, creating the 3-D effect.
“It started out as a hobby, and 
then it got out of hand,” Kaufman, 77, joked. He has been working on his elaborate pieces since he retired 10 years ago.
Stephanie and Peggy Gust 
bought three corian “Push and Pulls,” handheld devices used to pull out hot oven racks, as stock-ing stuffers for the holidays.
Stephanie Gust said she re-
members Kaufman’s booth from last year.
“What was so impressive about 
it was the detail,” she said.
This year, the diversity of artists 
and a prevalence of handcrafted art has made it a standout event for her.
Some artists, like stainless-steel 
jewelry artist David Conroy, drove across the country to attend the festival.
Conroy drove two days from 
Baltimore to attend the Art Har-vest festival in Dunedin, Florida, and decided to sell his nuts and bolts necklaces, earrings, bracelets and rings at the downtown festi-val, too. But on Saturday, he only sold $600 in jewelry, despite his $4,000 goal.
“It is frustrating at times, and 
I know what I do, and I know no one does it,” he said.
But other longtime vendors said 
this year’s attendance is up from previous years.
Sky Campbell and Sarah Hinds, 
Gainesville glass-blowing artists with Somewhere Glassworks, put up their colorful glass booth for 
the 10th year at the festival.
Their kaleidoscope-designed 
glass ornaments, pumpkins and 
vases brightened the street.
“This is our hometown show,” 
Hinds said. “Everyone is really loyal to this show. It really brings Gainesville out.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON, D.C. — President 
Barack Obama introduced his choice for 
attorney general Saturday as an accom-
plished prosecutor from New York City 
who will carry on a “fierce commitment to equal justice.”
Obama argued at a White House cer-
emony that it’s “pretty hard to be more qualified” for the job of attorney general than Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch.
“Loretta might be the only lawyer in 
America who battles mobsters and drug lords and terrorists, and still has the repu-tation for being a charming people per-son,” Obama said to laughter from those 
who packed the Roosevelt Room for the 
announcement.
Lynch, 55, would be the first African-
American woman to serve as attorney gen-eral. She would replace outgoing Attorney 
General Eric Holder, who also was at Sat-urday’s announcement and was the first black head of the Justice Department.
Lynch said she was humbled and 
thrilled at the prospect of leading “the only Cabinet department named for an ideal.”
“If I have the honor of being confirmed 
by the Senate, I will wake up every morn-ing with the protection of the American people my first thought,” she said. “And I will work every day to safeguard our citi-zens, our liberties, our rights and this great 
nation which has given so much to me and 
my family.”
Republicans have promised tough scru-
tiny of Obama’s pick after years of battles 
with Holder, who is close to Lynch and 
appointed her as chair of a committee that advises him on policy. 
Holder has been an unflinching cham-
pion of civil rights in enforcing the nation’s 
laws, and his successor will be left to grap-
ple with several prominent civil rights is-sues that have been elevated on his watch.MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

The UF Health Shands Trans-
plant Center was nationally rec-
ognized by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for its quality care.
The organ transplant center 
was designated as a Blue Distinc-tion Center, a title that recognizes 
the quality, cost and access of 
hospital care across the nation.  
“Without the centers of dis-
tinction, patients might have to be directed to a center further from home and from family sup-port,” said Stephan Moore, the administrative director of the transplant center.  
More than 7,000 organ trans-
plants have been performed in the last 50 years, according to a press release.
To become a distinction cen-
ter, the UF transplant program annually submits information to insurers through a standardized process within the United Net-work for Organ Sharing admin-istrators’ page, Moore said.  
“Large insurers will review 
our program information, which shows the depth of resources and staff we bring to the table as UF 
Health in the area of transplant,” 
he said. “And insurers also re-view all transplant program pa-tient outcomes to ensure high-quality results.”
After the review, the Blue 
Cross and Blue Shield Association then selects the centers. National  programs that are recognized in-
clude bariatric surgery, cardiac 
care, complex and rare cancers, knee and hip replacement, spine surgery and transplants, accord-ing to the Blue Cross and Blue Shield website.
For transplant programs, the 
association recognizes facility ac-creditation, faculty accreditation, number of transplants and the outcome of transplants.
Nine hospitals in Florida have 
received the Blue Distinction rec-ognition.
John Wingard, the director of 
the UF bone and marrow trans-plant program, said he believes it was chosen due to its outcomes, patient satisfaction, moderately large center and offering of dif-ferent transplant types.
“This will increase our num-
bers of transplants,” Wingard said. “In general, the more we do, 
the better we do, and the more 
resources we will have to offer a greater range of services.”
UF is also one of four Blue 
Distinction Centers+ for adult lung transplants. The Blue Dis-tinction Centers+ are hospitals that are recognized for their ex-pertise and efficiency of care. 
“We have a great team who 
are passionate, committed, high-ly effective, caring, and they love what they do and the patients we serve,” Wingard said.

More than 300 motorcycles 
buzzed through Gainesville’s streets 
Sunday morning as part of Bikers on Parade.
The event, which was put on to 
support American Hometown Vet-erans Assist, started at Santa Fe Col-lege and ended at Auto Plus Race-way. Bikers took a police-escorted, 15-mile route down Northwest  39th Avenue. After the ride, people sipped on Budweiser and feasted on barbecue sandwiches.
Jim Conner, 70, of Wellborn, 
Florida, rode his red motorcycle in the parade with his Australian cattle dog, Jeep, in the sidecar. Conner served in the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War.
“I think it’s great,” the 70-year-
old said. “These guys need all the help they can get after all they’ve gone through.”
Chuck Wilder helped start the 
nonprofit organization after his son-in-law returned from Iraq paralyzed and missing a leg in 2004.
Beau Crevasse, who has been 
with the organization for a few 
years, wanted to bring the event 
back to Gainesville after it stopped 
in 2009. This year, they raised more than $100,000.
Michael Christensen, a 60-year-
old carpenter from Branford, Florida, rode his purple Harley named “the 
Buffalo Heifer,” in remembrance of 
his brother and father who served in the U.S. Navy.
Christensen said organizations 
like American Hometown Veterans Assist are a blessing to veterans.
“I appreciate it so much,” he 
said. “You see vets injured all the time who need help, but think of 
the people who didn’t come back.

The NCAA reveals its bracket for the 2014 Women’s College Cup today 
at 4:30 on NCAA.com. Florida, ranked No. 8 by NSCAA, has earned a berth in the tournament 17 times out of the program’s 19-year history.Elliott Orkin and the UF men’s tennis team wrapped up its Fall season on Sunday. Read the story on Page 16.MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
NASHVILLE, Tennessee — 
The Florida offense made a 180-
degree turn in just a week’s time 
— at least philosophically speak-
ing.
Roughly one week ago facing 
Georgia — the 10th-ranked rush 
defense in the country — Flori-
da’s offense ran for 418 rushing yards, led by tailbacks Matt Jones and Kelvin Taylor who both had more than 190 yards rushing. 
The 418 rushing yards was the 
second highest yardage given up on the ground in Georgia’s foot-ball program history. 
Starting quarterback Treon 
Harris didn’t do much quarter-backing at all, unless you count attempting just six passes in the entire game as effective quarter-
backing. 
He did have a fumble on a 
handoff exchange early in the 
ﬁ  rst quarter, but that was his 
only blemish on the day. 
Following a performance in 
which the offense didn’t need to 
sling it around to put up points on the board, the Gators went into Vanderbilt Stadium on Sat-
urday facing the 82nd-ranked rush defense in the country. 
So the game plan could’ve 
easily been the same as the one 
against Georgia to attain success, right?
Florida’s offensive staff had a 
different plan to cut through the Commodore’s defense, and it can be described in one word — bal-
ance. 
The offense was as balanced 
from running to passing as pos-sible — rushing for 214 yards and passing for 215. 
The numbers were good 
enough to stave off Vanderbilt 
handedly, winning in Nashville 
34-10. 
Harris, who was recruited to 
Florida as a dual-threat quarter-

Following the win, coach Will 
Muschamp said Harris, although a true freshman, carries himself 
like a veteran quarterback every week in practice and has the abil-ity to keep that maturity level in 
game situations. 
“I think the thing that strikes 
me is the maturity,” Muschamp 
said. 
“He does not get fazed. He’s 
been accurate in practice. That doesn’t shock me there. But just the maturity of carrying that to the game has been outstanding.”

Billy Donovan’s son, also named 
Billy Donovan, could soon follow in 
his father’s footsteps.
“Against the wishes of his mother, 
yes that is what he wants to do, he wants to coach,” Donovan said after Florida’s exhibition game against Bar-ry.
Donovan added his son isn’t quite 
sure at what level he wants to coach.
“Listen, I 
think it’s a great profession,” Donovan said. “I think it’s very, very rewarding. It’s one of those professions where you really have got to be passionate about it and he appears to be that way about the game.”
The younger Donovan is a redshirt 
senior guard in his second year with the Gators. Last year he made 16 ap-pearances, in which he scored a total of four points.
“A man of many traits… He’s a little 
bit of everything,”
Donovan said his son is practicing, 
though very little, doing some ﬁ  lm work and spending a time with the team.
“I think it’s been a good year for 
him so the fact that he’s got the chance to experience a lot of different things right now,” Donovan said. “He’s just available when we need him.”
During Florida’s exhibition against 
Barry, the younger Donovan was in the ﬁ  lm room inside the O’Connell Center watching with suspended sophomore Lil’ Billy wants to coachJOHNSON’S JOURNAL
NASHVILLE, Tennes-see — Vernon Har-greaves III was wor-
ried about the cold before the game started. His Tampa blood isn’t thick enough for an autumn evening in the Tennessee hills. Thankfully for Florida, its ballhawks ﬂ  ew around and heated the Gators on a chilly evening, charging them to a 34-10 victory against Vanderbilt.
In each of Florida’s three losses, it has 
had at least three turnovers. But the Gators 
sang a different tune Saturday night in Mu-sic City, procuring four turnovers from the 
Commodores. On consecutive offensive 
plays, Florida recovered two of Gainesville native Ralph Webb’s fumbles to generate 10 points, riding that wave to the locker room with a 17-7 lead.
Late in the game, the Gators added two 
more turnovers. One from Hargreaves, on a play that is exhibit A for why you’ve only got around 18 more times to see him wear-
ing orange and blue before he leaves NCAA 
bondage to go get paid on Sundays. 
The other was an absolute beauty of a one-handed catch by Jalen Ta-bor, a play coach Will Muschamp quipped he taught the freshman on the second day of practice. 
It is a strange thing to write, 
but a win over Vanderbilt served as payback. Not only because of the mere fact that the Commo-dores beat the Gators on home-coming last season, but how they 
went about beating Florida — forcing four turnovers, and winning with only 183 total yards on offense.
It helps to play a bad opponent, but Flor-
ida resembled a decent football team Satur-day, one that could handle its business at least. It capitalized on opportunities, hit big plays and won going away — leaving little room for doubt. 
Certainly four turnovers could point to 
a win being ﬂ  uky, but six yards per play and 429 total yards isn’t a ﬂ  uke. The Gators beat a 0-6 team in conference play like you 
ask a team to beat an 0-6 team in conference 
play. 
It was night and day from their last win 
over Georgia. The Gators had 418 yards on Turnovers key to Gators winSEE OFFENSE, PAGE 15

UF Bask etball“A man of many traits… He’s 
a little bit of everything,”
Billy Donovan
UF Men’s Basketball CoachAlthough Orr was hailed as a 
possible NFL talent on the Gators’ 
defensive line entering this year, the ﬁ  fth-year senior failed to live up to the hype and then sunk down 
on the depth chart after undergoing 
arthroscopic knee surgery.
Despite the opposing trends of 
Orr and Bullard at defensive tackle, Orr still pushed to play ahead of Bullard against Vanderbilt on Sat-urday.
“He hadn’t started all week in 
practice,” Muschamp said. “He 
came to me and didn’t understand 
why he wasn’t starting … I thought we’ve been productive with the four guys that have been starting.”
Orr “expressed displeasure” 
toward Muschamp’s decision and gave the fourth-year coach an ulti-matum.
“He said he wanted to start and 
he was leaving if he wasn’t start-ing,” Muschamp said.
“I said, ‘If you go home, you’re 
done. You’re not a Florida Gator anymore.’”
Orr obliged and took the next 
bus out of Nashville.
Muschamp broke the news to 
the team during the pre-game din-ner at the hotel but kept the mes-sage short and to the point. With a vital Southeastern Conference game looming just ahead, he didn’t want to bog the players down with possibly distracting details.
“Those kids are resilient, they 
go play,” Muschamp said. “They enjoy playing and move on very 
quickly.”

Leon Orr never asked to play for 
Will Muschamp.
Urban Meyer recruited Orr out 
of Gulf High in New Port Richey 
and signed him to his 2010 recruit-ing class. One year later, Meyer was out of Gainesville and Orr was left 
to play for a ﬁ  rst-year head coach in 
Muschamp.
The relationship between the 
two appeared healthy and produc-tive at ﬁ  rst.In the pairing’s ﬁ  rst season to-
gether, Orr played in all 13 games 
and recorded 10 tackles. The next 
year, he racked up 15 and then 21 the year after that.
As one of Florida’s most vet-
eran players — he was just one of eight Meyer recruits still left over — Orr was expected to lead a defen-sive line that lost signiﬁ  cant talent through the NFL Draft in May.
But in ﬁ  ve games, Orr has just 
16 tackles including just two assist-ed tackles in his last game against Georgia. As a result, Muschamp 
decided to bench Orr in favor of 
the more productive Bullard on the inside.
Even without Orr in the starting 
lineup, the Gators are 15th in the nation in run defense, allowing just 116.3 yards per game. The only SEC school to allow fewer rushing yards is Alabama at 89.8 yards per game.
The starting four, which includes 
Bryan Cox Jr. replacing Bullard at defensive end, all said they felt as if that was the right starting lineup.
“I asked those four guys, ‘Who’s 
better?’” Muschamp said. “They all thought they were better. That’s the way it goes.”
Although Orr was expected to be 
“heavily involved” according to the school’s release before the game, he did not appreciate a junior starting over him.
Bullard said Orr never ap-
proached him with the issue, how-ever, and was surprised that his teammate chose to take a bus home 
rather than stay with the team.
When asked how he and the 
rest of the squad would handle be-
ing a man down for the rest of the year, Bullard said the Gators had no choice but to persevere.
“You just have to, you just have 
to go and play, wasn’t gonna slack cause we lost somebody,” Bullard 
said. “We got players who can step 
up and play.”

With Florida trailing 7-0 about midway 
through the ﬁ  rst quarter, Kelvin Taylor 
found a way to tie the game. Taylor 
led Florida on its second drive of the 
game, going six times for 34 yards and 
capping the possession with a 13-
yard, second-effort touchdown.
KEY STAT: 4
The Gators forced four turnovers on Saturday 
— two fumble recoveries and two interceptions — 
while not turning the ball over themselves. This 
brings Florida back to a a +4 turnover margin on 
the season, which is good for 6th in the SEC.

TURNING POINT
After Vanderbilt made a ﬁ  eld goal in the fourth 
quarter to make it a two-possession game, Treon 
Harris put the game away. On Florida’s next drive, 
Harris marched UF to a touchdown on a six-play 
drive that he ended with a 33-yard touchdown run.
Harris ﬁ  nally had the opportu-
nity to show what he has to of-
fer as a starting quarterback. 
After being held to just six 
pass attempts against Georgia 
in his ﬁ  rst start, Harris went 
13 of 21 for 215 yards against Vanderbilt while also 
racking up 49 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 
the ground.
Two plays after Vanderbilt stopped 
Florida on the goal line in the second 
quarter, the Gators defense got the 
ball back for UF. Buck linebacker Dante 
Fowler Jr., forced Commodores running 
back Ralph Webb to fumble and safety 
Jabari Gorman came up with it for the ﬁ  rst turnover 
of the game.
Hargreaves was a ball hawk 
all night against the Com-
modores. The sophomore 
ﬁ  nished the game with four 
tackles, a pass breakup and 
an interception — his second 
of the season.
On ﬁ  rst and 10 from the UF 31 late in 
the third quarter, Treon Harris threw 
the ball deep — a facet of the game the 
Gators struggled with throughout the 
season. But this time around, the true 
freshman found wide receiver Quinton 
Dunbar for a 60-yard gain. Florida scored a touch-
down three plays later.
After three games with 
limited to no action, Dunbar 
ﬁ  nally broke out. The red-
shirt senior recorded four 
catches for a game-high 
97 yards on Saturday for a 
24.3-yard average per catch.

Against the Commodores, they had 429 yards with near perfect balance — 215 through the air, 214 on the ground.
They looked explosive at times, like 
they were willing to take chances — like Will Muschamp swears they were last weekend; a 48-yard deep ball to Ahmad Fulwood; a 60-yard pass to Quinton Dunbar; a deep pass attempt that fell short at the end of the half instead of the normal conservative folding of the tents heading into the intermission. This was a different Florida, this was a better Florida.
Offensive coordinator Kurt Roper 
joked on his way out of the stadium that “we completed a forward pass we didn’t 
take football back any further.” A lot of 
that comes from the spark generated by Harris, and by spark I mean the ability to lead a receiver deep and complete a long pass. They also showed off now-backup Jeff Driskel in a new role, a role more reminiscent of what Blake Bell does at Oklahoma, a role that takes advantage of his legs.
But make no mistake, this team is still 
powered by defense. It still finds its heat from that side of the ball. Harris looked 
good, but this team still needs work 
moving forward to develop an identity and to maintain it consistently, and that may be the hardest part.that although the maturity level 
of Harris is surprising, he adds the intangibles to his game that pushes a quarterback to the next 
level in game time situations. 
“Yeah. At that position, ab-
solutely,” Muschamp said. “But 
he’s got a competitive edge about him. That’s a talent. It’s hard to 
measure competitive edge until 
you get into the situations and he has the competitive edge about him.”
Harris wasn’t afraid to take 
shots downfield either, and wide receivers Quinton Dunbar and Ahmad Fulwood came through as targets — Dunbar had four 
receptions for 97 yards including 
a long reception for 60 yards in the third quarter. Fulwood added a long catch for 48 yards on the 
right sideline in the second quar-
ter. 
“Catching the deep ball is im-
portant,” Muschamp said. “So much goes into the lull that we went into as an offense is confi-dence. 
“When you lose confidence a 
little bit, you don’t play as fast, you’re not as sure of yourself, you’re not as assertive in what you’re doing all the time.”
Harris had to adjust to person-
nel changes along the offensive line as well, as offensive linemen Tyler Moore and Chaz Green both were injured, causing shifts 
along the line, but it didn’t affect 
the execution level on offense. 
“We had to move some guys 
around, but hats off to our offen-
sive staff,” Muschamp said. 
“We were able to stay produc-
tive.” 
Next up for Florida is South-
eastern Conference Eastern divi-sion foe South Carolina, which 
is a must-win for Florida to stay alive in the SEC East race. 
“We need to play South Caro-
lina,” Muschamp said. “We need to take care of Florida and South Carolina and let the chips fall where they may.”

for the first three games of the season.
“He was back there with my son and 
another video guy,” Donovan said. “They just sat there and tried to help him through watching what was going on and trying to talk him through some things.”
Walk-on mentality: Walk-on Jacob 
Kurtz played 17 minutes against Barry on Thursday. In that time, Donovan wasn’t pleased with what he saw from the senior forward.
“I’m very, very disappointed with him 
because I think Jake is very important to this team and I think sometimes Jake views himself as a walk-on and I think sometimes Jake doesn’t want to step on anybody’s toes,” Donovan said.
On Thursday, Kurtz contributed six 
points and two rebounds.
“We don’t have a very full bench of 
front court players and he can do more and he’s not doing more,” Donovan said. “He’s got to stop maybe just being this nice guy and just happy to be here and he’s gotta start getting back to the things he did a year ago.”
Kurtz saw more play at the start of last 
season because the Gators were facing similar depth issues because of suspen-sions. In the first seven games of the 2013-14 season, he averaged 19.7 minutes, 4.1 points and 3.9 rebounds.  
“He’s a far better player a year ago 
than he is right now and I got to find a way to get him back to where he was be-fore,” Donovan said. Tabor had a one-handed interception

The Gators ended their fall 
season with mostly wins as they 
stepped off their home courts in 
the Florida Invitational on Sun-
day. 
Unranked Miami, North Flori-
da and No. 8 Texas played No. 15 
Florida at the Ring Tennis Com-
plex, which began Friday. 
The Gators ended with a re-
cord of 19-3 in singles, with most of Florida’s losses coming against 
higher-ranked Texas.
Sophomore Maxx Lipman, 
ranked No. 100, was one of four 
Gators to win all three of his 
matches in the tournament. The 
sophomore finished the sea-son with a win over University of North Florida’s Jack Findel-Hawkins, 6-2, 6-1.
Sophomore Elliott Orkin, ju-
nior Diego Hidalgo and redshirt freshman Oliver Landert also finished the season also finished 
their singles matches unscathed 
this weekend.
Chase Perez-Blanco dropped 
his second match to University of 
Texas’ No. 106 Adrien Berkowicz, 6-3, 7-6(4) but finished the sea-son with a win over UNF’s Lasse Muscheites, 6-2, 6-4.
Joshua Wardell won his first 
match of the tournament against University of Texas’ William Jou, 
6-1, 7-5. 
In his second match, he de-
feated University of Miami’s Nile 
Clark, 6-2, 6-3.
While the victories were en-
couraging, not all Gators ended their season with a “W.” 
No. 70 Gordon Watson dropped 
his second match to University of 
Texas’ No. 113 Nick Naumann, 
6-4, 4-6, 6-1. 
Senior Richard Brej dropped 
his third match to Kevin Bondar, 
6-3, 6-1.
The Gators ended their Fall sea-
son 17-1 in doubles with one loss 
from pair Wardell and Landert against University of Miami’s 
Bernard Tefel and Andrew Har-
rington, 8-5. 
“I can see the work that we’ve 
done in practice, a lot of the foun-
dation things we’ve worked on in 
practice, are showing in matches,” assistant coach Mark Merklein said in a release. 
“Physically, we’re stronger… 
I’m very happy with the fall. From the mid-point to the finish has been really good.”
As the Fall season wrapped up on Sunday, the smaller tourna-ment gave the Gators a chance to end in wins, and six of the eight who played won their last match-es of 2014. 
In the six tournaments Florida 
competed in this fall, only one player left with a title. 
Orkin won the singles title 
in the UF-hosted SEC Fall Clas-
sic on Sept. 22. Aside from the 5-foot-8 right-hander’s win, the Gators had two players reach the 
semifinals — Perez-Blanco in the 2014 USTA Collegiate Court Invi-tational Nov. 1 and Lipman in the USTA/ITA Regionals Champion-
ship Oct. 19.
