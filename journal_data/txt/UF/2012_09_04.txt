Visitors could hear the laugh-
ter before they saw the 25-foot-tall 
climbing wall towering over the downtown plaza.
The second annual Labor Daze 
Fest, hosted at Bo Diddley Commu-nity Plaza, drew a crowd of about 2,000 people to celebrate the Labor Day weekend, said event organizer Trisha Ingle. The event showcased progressive groups and city ven-dors alongside community organiz-ers who focused on services for the working class.
Across the plaza, girls no older 
than 6 years old cartwheeled in the stubby grass while Occupy Gainesville members sat nearby fan-ning themselves with clipboards.
Students for a Democratic Society 
was stationed near a potted-plant vendor, and an Obama for America tent sat next to a Hula-Hoop seller.
Jose Soto, president of UF’s Grad-
uate Assistants United, said this year’s festival was bigger and better than the last.“Last year, it was half of what you 
see here,” the UF food and resource economics Ph.D. student said. “It’s been an exponential growth.”
He said the success stemmed 
from Ingle and her husband. They established the festival last year to unify the county’s various progres-sive groups in a fun way.
This year, Ingle felt the Labor 
Day celebration encompassed her original goal.
“We covered all of the bases,” she 
said. “We can celebrate the working people at the same time in the same place.”
Ingle wasn’t the only person 
thrilled with the event’s success.
Lisa Labbe, 50, smiled behind the 
Gainesville Area Chapter of the Na-
tional Organization for Women tent. She said she collected more than two full pages of email addresses from in-terested attendants and was happy to reach out to the working community.
“I loved getting to talk to every-
one about issues that are important to me,” Labbe said.

Turlington Plaza has no-
ticeably been down one pair 
of hot shorts lately.
On Aug. 24, Dennis Kane 
— also known as “the Turling-ton dancer” — said he woke up “a little more edgy” than usual.
So when the 37-year-old 
started seeing students paying more attention to their phones than to their peers, his mind began reeling, starting a train of thought that would end with University Police tres-passing him from campus.
“I started making the con-
nection between them and those people who shoot peo-ple up,” Kane said Thursday.
According to a UPD report, 
Kane “made a threatening statement” while on Turling-ton Plaza on Aug. 24 at about noon. Police ofﬁ  cers began searching campus for Kane at about 3 p.m.
Kane said he had been 
shouting to about 60 people regarding the importance of being nice to one another. He said the reason mass shoot-ings occur is because lonely individuals go crazy and start plotting revenge on society.
But bystander Tammy Tang 
told police a different story, ac-cording to the UPD report.
Kane “was just shout-
ing out about how he has no friends, the universe is mean-ingless and that we are all idiots,” Tang wrote in a state-ment.
She wrote that she and her 
friends began feeling uncom-fortable when Kane said, “I should just get a gun and start shooting people.”
Tang, a 19-year-old UF stu-
dent, could not be reached for comment.

◗ POLICE EJECTED 35 PEOPLE 
AND ARRESTED TWO. 
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
As thousands of fans battled the 
heat to catch the ﬁ  rst game of the 
2012 Florida Gators football season, University Police and Gainesville Police ofﬁ  cers had their share of sta-dium ejections and arrests.
At the UF-Bowling Green State 
University game on Saturday, po-lice ejected a total of 35 people from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, including the arrests of two UF students.
According to a UPD press re-
lease, police issued six civil cita-tions for alcohol possession inside the stadium.
The most common reasons for ejections on Saturday were alcohol possession and fans standing on seats.
This year’s game saw a decrease 
in ejections and arrests compared to last year’s season opener against Florida Atlantic University.
On opening day in 2011, police 
ejected 53 people, issued four civil citations and arrested three people — two for battery on a law enforce-ment ofﬁ  cer and one for alcohol possession. None of the arrests in-volved UF students, according to a UPD-archived press release.
As part of a Gainesville city ordi-
nance prohibiting alcohol inside the stadium, police will continue to is-sue citations to people caught with alcohol instead of arresting them, according to the release.

Gainesville residents 
laughed hard, clapped hard 
and sometimes gasped hard over the crackle of projectors Sunday night to watch “The Gong Show,” a collection of short films that showcased UF’s Curation as Production class.
The class, which is being 
offered for the first time this Fall, was created to bolster Gainesville’s vibrant film scene and to teach students how to organize and curate their own shows.
Students will plan their 
own shows throughout the semester, but “The Gong Show” was a collective effort to kick off the class’ events.
The class picked 111 16mm 
short films from a collection in the Turlington Hall base-ment and showed them at The Backyard at Boca Fiesta and Palomino. The audience chose the lineup by voting and by striking a gong to move to the next film.
The idea is based off of a 
1970s comedy show by the same title, said Roger Beebe, professor of the class and Florida Experimental Film and Video Festival artistic di-rector.
While most films were 
struck down quickly, audi-ence members saw “Kama Sutra Rides Again” until the end, watching as an animat-ed mustached man and his wife had sex in contorted po-sitions.Attendees smiled until the 
end of “The Most Wonder -
ful Egg in the World,” which was about three chickens who were competing for their kingdom’s crown by laying the most perfect egg.
English senior Sarah 
Keenan, 21, said her favorite film was “Bill Cosby on Prej-udice,” which showed Cosby smoking a cigar and throw-ing insults at various demo-graphics. It got gonged fairly early amid an uproar of boos, but Beebe, who was running the projectors, decided to keep playing the film.
There will be events almost 
every week until the end of the semester, Beebe said.
The next show will be Ex-
perimental Karaoke on Sept. 12 in the same location. The event will feature “end-of-the-spectrum” films with ka-raoke jams, he said.
While the films in Sun-
day’s event were vastly dif-ferent in nature, Beebe said he was happy with the result and that it helped set the tone for the rest of the semester.
“I wish I’d seen a little 
more of some,” he said. “I wish I’d seen a little less of some. But it turned out well.”UF film class brings

Clad in a Gators shirt and fol-
lowing a half step behind his moth-
er, 3-year-old Isaac Searcy babbled in his tiny toddler way about his favorite football team.
Searcy and his family, alongside 
about 3,000 UF students, Gainesville residents and Gators fans, attended United Downtown to enjoy the community atmosphere and cel-ebrate the home team in the streets of downtown Gainesville.
The free, family-friendly event, 
hosted by United Way of North Central Florida, was the kickoff event for the 2012 football season. The organization is continuing the event after a successful run last year.
There are three more of the 
events scheduled throughout the remainder of the season. The events will happen the Fridays before the Gators play Kentucky, Louisiana State University and South Caro-lina.
The event brought together 
groups from alumni to baby Gators. Elderly couples in orange and blue strode together hand in hand as toddlers waited eagerly for custom-made balloon hats.
“We’ve been 
to these festivals about six times b e f o r e h a n d , ” said Jennison Searcy, 37, Issac’s mother. “I feel like I always run 
into my friends and families of 
his friends from school. It’s a great community event.”
About 50 vendors came out for 
Friday night’s festival, said Debbie Mason, president and CEO of the United Way of North Central Flor -
ida. Food trucks lined the end of the festival alongside restaurants, and attendees milled in and out of stores throughout the evening.
“It’s great for families,” Mason 
said. “But if you don’t have kids, you can still go buy a beer, sit on the plaza and listen to music.”
Live tunes on Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza entertained an audi-ence on the lawn. Couples danced near Hula-Hooping children. Com-munity vendors sold UF-inspired apparel and jewelry, drawing in Gators fans. Area artists painted fresh canvases on the street, show-casing their work.
At the end of the street stood a 
giant Gator-head bounce house to fascinate young Florida fans. Its jaws snapped shut, chomping down as kids jumped as high as their little legs could take them.
For Isaac and his family, the 
event was a way to celebrate The Gator Nation, and they said they plan to keep coming to the events.
“I came here because it was a 
Gator night,” Isaac said, staring at the bounce house.

I’d seen a little less of

Get ready to go country at 
Gator Growl this year.
Country musician Josh Turner 
will play Gator Growl 2012, which 
is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Nov. 9 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
This year’s theme is “United 
We Growl” and aims to honor military members for their work in keeping the country safe, ac-cording to the event website.
Gator Growl, often called the 
largest student-run pep rally in the nation, has brought many fa-mous performers to Gainesville. These include Jerry Seinfeld, Bill Cosby and Dane Cook, according to the site.
Turner has released five stu-
dio albums. 
His latest, “Punching Bag,” 
debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. The record has also cracked the Bill-board 200’s Top 5.
“We think he’s a fantastic art-
ist for the campus, the commu-nity, and we really think he’s the best artist for this year’s theme,” said Director of Public Relations Sean Quinn.
Turner’s performance will join 
the Gator Growl lineup, which includes a to-be-announced com-edy act, fireworks and the Para-Commandos skydiving team. The Dazzlers, UF cheerleaders and the Gator football team’s seniors will make appearances as well.
Tickets can be purchased 
through gatorgrowl.org. They are set for $15 for students and $25 for alumni and guests.

◗ A STUDY FOUND OTHER 
UNIVERSITIES DON’T MAKE AS MUCH USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. 
KATHERINE HAHN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When two men and a gun 
were spotted in a Shands at 
UF garage last week, cell-phones all over campus started buzzing with rapid-fire UF Alert text messages and emails.
A study released last 
week by mStoner and Slover Linett Strategies found that many colleges aren’t fully utilizing social media  — es-
pecially when there’s a cri-sis happening, according to more than half of the 1,187 respondents.
But UF makes an effort to 
get emergency messages out quickly in as many ways as possible, Bruce Floyd, UF so-cial media specialist, said.
The university uses the 
InformaCast system, which allows the same sentences to be sent in different ways. 
Police dispatchers have 
access to the system, Floyd said.
“Some people might not 
get a text message, but they get the tweet,” he said.
In situations like the Aug. 30 incident, UPD decides on which media the alert should be displayed. 
In addition to text and 
Twitter, there is a Facebook page for UF Alerts. 
A speaker system in al-
most every classroom and office on campus can also broadcast audio alerts.
UF’s InformaCast system 
has been in place for about a year, Emergency Manage-ment Coordinator Kenneth Allen said.
The messages are based 
on prewritten templates, he said. 
Abbreviations are used to 
fit the information within text message character limits.
If students aren’t getting 
text alerts, Allen recommend-ed they check the emergency contact information they en-tered on UF’s websites.
First-year mechanical en-
gineering graduate student Zhiwei Huang, 26, said he thinks the way UF sends its alerts is effective. 
Huang said he doesn’t 
mind getting multiple mes-sages during crises because they’re always about some-thing important.
“It’s always good to know 
when something bad is hap-pening around you,” he said.UF utilizes mul-
tiple platforms to alert community gator growlJosh Turner to perform at Gator Growl

Kane: “I have other things to focus on”
After the speech, Kane said he 
stayed “happily” on Turlington 
Plaza until about 2 p.m. He then moved near the Reitz Union Col-onnade.
At about 3:30 p.m., Kane said a 
police officer on bike approached him and asked what he talked about earlier on Turlington Plaza. Kane said he was confused at the time; the UPD report says he was cooperative. Eventually, Kane said, five officers were questioning him.
“Where I was at the time, there 
was no way to defend myself — no witnesses,” he said.
Eventually Officer Daymon 
Kizzar told Kane he had to stay off of UF’s campus for three years, ac-cording to the report.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad 
Barber said the department hasn’t had problems with Kane before. Officers at the scene made the tres-passing call.
“We assess the nature of the 
threat, and that was what was done in this case,” he said. “Be-cause there was no crime commit-ted, anyone else would likely re-ceive the same punishment.”
Kane said he doesn’t know how 
his words were misconstrued.
“What I do is so abnormal that 
sometimes I feel guilty about mak-ing people feel very uncomfort-able,” Kane said.
At Panera Bread on Thursday 
night, a few students asked Kane what happened.
“Do you think it was a hate 
crime?” asked Richard Viera, a 20-year-old political science se-nior.
“I’m not a piece of crap like 
everyone thinks I am,” Kane re-sponded. “I deserve better treat-ment than that.”
Viera said he became accus-tomed to seeing Kane on cam-pus this summer wearing scanty, bright ensembles. He was shocked to hear Kane was trespassed from UF, he said.
“Someone dancing in the back-
ground is completely different than a guy in my face telling me I’m going to hell,” Viera said, ref-erencing the religious speakers of-ten on Turlington Plaza.
Kane said he would like to get 
back onto UF’s campus. He’s ap-pealing the trespass charge. But he said he thinks Santa Fe College or his previous home by University of California, Los Angeles would be good alternatives.
“If I was the kind of person 
who ultimately gave a crap, maybe I’d have more to say,” he said. “It’s like if someone is paralyzed on one side of their body, the other side can be really strong. I have other avenues and other things to focus on.”

President Barack Obama talk-
ed student loans, space program 
funding and beer in an unconven-tional interview on the Internet last week.
Users of social news website 
reddit.com were invited to “ask him anything,” giving ordinary people — including some UF stu-dents — a chance to pick the presi-dent’s brain. With this, Obama and his team broke into yet another social media outlet, joining profiles on sites like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. He leads Republican can-didate Mitt Romney in social me-dia use, according to adage.com.
UF materials science and en-
gineering junior Patrick Terry, 20, submitted a series of questions during the Obama AMA. But none made the cut — the president only answered 10 questions.
Terry, who moderates a 
Gainesville subreddit, sees the AMA as a campaign move. But he said it could further legitimize Reddit as a source of information, depending on whether or not “it becomes a regular election stop.”
It may be. On Monday, Liber -
tarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson announced he will hold his second AMA on Reddit Sept. 11.
In his AMA, Obama addressed 
student loans and post-graduate job prospects in response to a ques-tion from Hilary Lee, an unem-ployed 26-year-old Northwestern University Law School graduate.
“I understand how tough it is 
out there for recent grads,” Obama wrote. “But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle-class jobs — and that’s why the choice in this election is so im-portant.”
It was nothing groundbreaking, 
Lee said, but still exciting.
“He did have to think about it for a couple minutes, and it is in his mind more than it was before he started,” she said.
Obama’s online presence was 
credited by many in 2008 for con-necting with young voters and pushing them to the polls. This year, candidates’ digital engage-ment is under even more scrutiny.
As of press time, the president 
has about 19 million followers on Twitter while Romney has about 1 million. Obama has about 28.2 million likes on Facebook as op-posed to Romney’s 6.2 million. The president has 1.2 million Instagram followers, but Romney has about 32,000.
Politics aside, 20-year-old graph-
ic design junior and Reddit user Ja-son McDade saw Obama’s Internet interaction as a nice gesture.
“It’s a neat little way to reach 
out,” McDade said. “I definitely think that as a whole, it was a posi-tive thing.”TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

How rappers start 
national discussions
Language is a funny thing.
There are as many hard rules about it as there are soft 
understandings.
So, what happens when rappers end up having pretty seri-
ous discussions about name-calling?
Lupe Fiasco recently released a song titled “B---h Bad.” He 
invites fans to join him in analyzing the consequences of using 
the word “b---h.”
Some of his lyrics include:“It doesn’t really matter if they have parental clearanceThey understand the Internet better than their parentsNow being the Internet, the content’s probably uncensoredThey’re young, so they’re malleable and probably unmen-
tored
A complicated combination, maybe with no relevanceUntil that intelligence meets their favorite singer’s prefer-
ence
‘Bad b---hes, bad b---hes, bad b---hesThat’s all I want and all I like in life is bad b---hes, bad b---
hes.’”
Fiasco is attempting to open up a dialogue about how young 
girls and boys are witnessing the usage of “b---h” in the overper-meating nature of pop culture.
“I think it’s something that’s very subtle — the idea of it, the 
‘bad b---h’ — it’s very subtle but it deﬁ  nitely has some destruc-tive elements to it,” Lupe said in a conversation with “RapFix Live.” “It has some troubling elements to it. Especially when you look at who it’s being marketed towards. That’s why we put the children in the video.”
The kids in the video are living in separate worlds. A young 
boy sees his mom singing along to lines like “N----s, I’m a bad b---h/ And I’m that b---h/ Something that’s far above average,” and the young girls see rappers praising dancers while yelling derogatory terms at them. Which of these worlds is OK?
Kanye West took to Twitter this weekend to open his own 
conversation about it.
He tweeted: “I usually never tweet questions but I struggle 
with this so here goes... Is the word B---H acceptable?”, “To be more speciﬁ  c, is it acceptable for a man to call a woman a b---h even if it’s endearing?” and “Even typing it in question form it’s still feels harsh?”
There’s probably never a great time to call someone a b---h. 
It’s a term that, traditionally, is used in a derogatory manner. Recently, though, female music artists such as Lady Gaga and Nicki Minaj have been using it in songs, perhaps in an attempt to reclaim it for themselves. Language is also a complicated thing.
Does the conversation started by these two rap artists include 
the full scope of what’s respectable to call a woman? Or should it start with how women refer to themselves?
What we need to do is keep in mind who we’re calling what. 
Language is a helpful thing. It lets us label, describe and add detail. Just be careful of how you use it.
No one wants Kanye to go on another Twitter rant about 
anything, so let’s just keep it cool.Financial aid: the gift that keeps on giving
Every UF student’s favorite email is the one stating, “Fi-nancial Aid has been disbursed to your account.” Many of the social networking updates I read last weekend 
relayed the excitement of ﬁ  nally receiving these funds.
Let’s start by appreciating the fact that a number of fed-
eral programs are inclined to support our generation’s stu-dents. Florida’s Bright Futures program is an excellent one for rewarding high school achievement with monetary sup-port for higher education.
We should also be thrilled to know that funding for Fed-
eral Pell Grants is set to increase under President Obama’s Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act.
Also, after much lobbying, plans to double student loan 
interest rates in July were successfully halted. I’m most cer-tainly appreciative, but I’ll save my political talk for a differ-ent column.
The facts are pretty simple: A college education costs 
money.
Finances are needed for tuition, textbooks, technology 
and the expense of living and eating away from home for possibly the ﬁ  rst time.
Ideally , one of the main reasons we go to college is to 
make an investment in ourselves and our futures. With this, we hope to be able to live the types of lifestyles we desire, whatever they may be.
Through tuition waivers, scholarships and grants, some 
students are fortunate enough to receive so much help that their tuition and fees are paid and extra money is left over. Instead of magically disappearing, the ﬁ  nances refund in the form of cold, hard cash into personal bank accounts.
However, in a land of equal opportunity, how ﬁ  tting is 
it that so many of these funds are so easily given out when every student’s need has not been fully met?
Even with numerous sources of ﬁ  nancial aid, many other 
students do not have their costs completely covered. What’s worse is when ﬁ  nancial aid funds are spent on items that aren’t school costs. Financial aid merely becomes “free mon-ey” to be spent frivolously on anything a student chooses.
This leads me to the gift and curse that is the student 
loan.It is awesome to know that our 
government supports the avail-ability of higher education to any-one who desires it.
However, even with grants 
and scholarships, some students are required to borrow additional funds in order to afford textbooks, housing fees and other expenses associated with school.
What bafﬂ  es me is how some students take out loans to 
pay for things like cars, scooters, Greek-organization chapter dues, shopping sprees or other unnecessary and outrageous expenses.
The debate begins over what one man considers a neces-
sity and what another sees as a luxury. Although many feel some things are vital for the college experience, are they re-ally worth putting yourself into debt?
No.My suggestion is to avoid taking out a loan unless you 
have exhausted all other options.
If you simply want something but can’t afford it, please 
don’t take out a student loan to pay for it. The thing about these loans is once you start taking them, they become harder to decline each semester. We are creatures of habit, so doing something a couple of times only makes it easier to contin-ue.
If you are fortunate enough to have ﬁ  nancial aid refunded 
to you, use it wisely . Set it aside for essentials you know you will have to pay for such as meals or housing payments.
Start learning how to save now. You never know when an 
emergency expense may arise.
Financial aid keeps on giving. Too bad it doesn’t always 
give what’s good.
Whether it speciﬁ  cally gives you lots of savings, accumu-
lated loan interest, stress, pressure, confusion or judgment, learn to use the government and other sponsors’ money wisely.

As a former Eagle Scout, I 
was shocked to learn of the Boy Scouts of Ameri-
ca’s decision to uphold discrimi-natory membership standards that exclude LGBTQ youth and volunteers from the organiza-tion.
I protest the unwillingness of 
the National Executive Board to make the deliberation of its re-view committee public, which has only promoted inaction on this issue and discredited scouts everywhere.
Scouting in my local troop has 
had an indelible influence on my life, and I am grateful to the adult leaders who mentored me, taught me and dedicated their time and effort to assist in opening doors to the outdoors, to community service, to their workplaces and to fun. Scouting introduced me to other people my age and kept some of us together for more than 10 years.
Scouting can be a wonderful 
influence on the lives of young people. It encourages children to be active in their communities, to find role models and to become connected with nature. 
The organization is composed 
of more than 2.7 million youth members, each of whom is in the process of maturing into a man. 
To ostracize any one of them, 
which the organization has done directly in the past, on the basis of his developing sexual identity, or to passively highlight his “devia-tion” from the norm of behavior in scouting is unconscionable.
The BSA should look to its (in-
dependently operated) counter -
part, Girl Scouts of America, to learn what it means to be tolerant of differences while advocating for and empowering its mem-bers.Instead, the BSA continues to 
conflate homosexuality with pe-dophilia among its adult volun-teers, whether the BSA will admit to it or not.
This is an unworthy slight and 
discourages parents who are ac-tive as scout leaders from valuing their children’s chosen identities in the private “introductions and discussions” the BSA suggests parents have with their children about sexuality. 
Moreover, the organization 
has well-established, existing safeguards to protect its scouts, such as two-deep adult leader -
ship and extensive youth protec-tion training.
The BSA believes that it is 
speaking for a majority of parents and volunteers in its decision. 
This may be true, but the BSA 
has not made its process open to input, instead falling back on cryptic and discouraging state-ments like, “the introduction of a resolution is procedural and handled with respect but does not indicate the organization is ‘reviewing a policy’ or signal a change in direction.”
The 10th point of the Scout 
Law states that scouts are brave. Its national leadership is not. Those individuals hide behind the 2000 Boy Scouts of America v. Dale court decision that allows the BSA, as a private organiza-tion, to set its own membership policies for the protection of its “expressive message.”
According to the Supreme 
Court, I have been affiliated with an organization for most of my life that has anti-LGBTQ advo-cacy as a primary reason for its existence. 
Lord Baden-Powell, founder 
of the scout movement, would be surprised.M y 
troop was privileged to have its 
meeting place in a local elemen-tary school. 
I participated in the Eagle 
Project of a scout who organized a birdhouse-building project for students. If homophobia contin-ues to define national BSA policy, however, valuable partnerships between public schools and local scouting will be put into jeop-ardy. 
The New York City public 
school system barred its doors to scout troops in the wake of BSA v. Dale, and more bans will surely be implemented this year. It would make me angry to see my own troop become a pariah and lose some of the respect that the Boy Scouts have traditionally been accorded as a result of the closed-door decisions of a small committee.
I feel that I can no longer pub-
licly associate myself with the BSA.
When — and I believe the 
change to be inevitable — the BSA amends its membership policy, I will be its foremost advocate.
Eagle Scouts are told regularly 
that the responsibilities of the rank do not end with adulthood, and I do not intend to absolve myself of my duty.
For my love of scouting, and 
per my duty as a lifelong scout, I intend to protest the policies of the national organization until they change. I encourage other people whose lives have been touched by scouting to do the same.

Have you noticed how 
news outlets now in-clude tweets as part 
of the news? Many newscasts now talk about celebrity Twit-ter accounts and any tweet that is outrageous enough to comment on. It seems as if a person can’t get through a single news report on the TV or read an article in the paper without hearing about a re-cent tweet from “so-and-so.” Honestly, who cares? Better yet,          why should I care?
Twitter, like Facebook, 
is a great communica-tion tool if used properly. But when mishandled, things can go terribly wrong. Some examples of out-of-line tweets can be seen with the recent London Olympics. With more than 150 mil-lion tweets about the Olym-pics posted during the 16  days  of the games, Twit-ter was declared the win-ner in what some are call-ing the “Social Olympics.” There were about 80,000 Olympic tweets per minute published after Usain Bolt won the gold medal in the 200-meter final, according to information given by Twitter in an article for Australian pa-per The Age.
The tweets started with 
Greek triple jumper Voula Pa-pachristou, who tweeted a rac-ist comment mocking African immigrants on her personal Twitter account. Papachristou was expelled from Greece’s Olympic team for saying, “With so many Africans in Greece, at least the mosqui-toes of West Nile mosquitoes will be eat homemade food.” Swiss soccer team player Mi-chel Morganella was the sec-ond athlete to be kicked out of the 2012 Olympic Games after posting a racist and threaten-ing tweet saying South Ko-rea’s athletes were “retards” and should “burn them-selves” shortly after Switzer-land’s 2-1 loss to South Korea. When the French and text-speak tweet is translated into English, Morganella tweeted something along the lines of, “I want to beat up all South Koreans. Bunch of men-tally handicapped retards.” Because of their need to blow off steam or show their racist colors to the rest of the world, it cost them big-time. 
Plus, from now on, whenev-
er their name is brought up they are forever tied to “that tweet.” These types of postings have been happening on Twitter for quite some time and have been making headline news, along with negatively affect-ing those who use the social media tool in the wrong way.
Back in 2010, Aussie swim-
mer Stephanie Rice tweeted “suck on that faggots” after Australia beat South Africa at rugby. In recent times, she has been under fire for posting a “racy” picture of herself wear-ing a two-piece swimsuit that left little to the imagination. During the 2008 Beijing Olym-pics, Twitter did not have as big of a role as it did in this year’s Olympics. “There were more tweets in a single day than during the entire 2008 Beijing Games,” Twitter reps wrote in a blog post.
My favorite part about the 
aftermath of these rash and senseless tweets is the “I’m sorry” tweet afterward. All three athletes above tweeted their apologies, with Rice apologizing to the public in a tearful news conference. Well, if you weren’t care-less with your actions, you wouldn’t have anything to pretend to be sorry for. They are not sorry for what they said; they are sorry they got slammed for the tweet. As always, the few ruin it for the rest of us, giving Twitter an image which teeter-tot-ters  between good and bad. The solution to the trouble the Olympic athletes got themselves into is to be more discreet, and it ap-plies to the rest of us, too. Take an extra two sec-onds of your time to think twice about your next post. And if you decide that your mother would be disappoint-ed in you if she saw it, give her the benefit of common sense and don’t make the post.
Maybe the solution is as 
simple as a short quote from the TV show “The Office”: “Whenever I’m about to do something, I think, ‘Would an idiot do that?’ And if they would, I do not do that thing.’”     Randi Reeder is a columnist for the Iowa State Daily at Iowa State University.

Doctors for America, a national group of physicians and medical students, stopped by the UF cam-
pus Friday to talk to students about health care as a part of its Patients Over Politics tour.

The doctors were in Friday. Or, rath-
er, they were on the North Lawn.
Doctors for America, a national 
nonprofit organization, has joined the 
presidential candidates in the cam-paign race for health care. This year’s election will decide whether the Af-fordable Care Act will remain a law or be repealed.
Doctors for America came to UF as 
part of its Patients Over Politics tour. Members want to inform student vot-ers about the act and encourage them to vote in support of it, said Scott Pop-pen, a Utah doctor working one of the nonpartisan organization’s booths Fri-day.“Students haven’t formed an opin-
ion, so they are more open-minded,” Poppen said.
The doctors gave out fliers about 
the health care act and how it can help students. For example, people ages 19 to 26 can now stay under their parents’ insurance, an opportunity six million young adults have taken, said Doctors for America Executive Director Alice Chen.
Third-year UF medical student 
Frank Walch, 24, said he liked that doctors are educating people, because many students don’t know a lot about the act.
“They put a face on a real issue that 
will be discussed in this election,” he said.Doctors tour campus with

Gainesville Police arrested a man 
accused of threatening to use a bev-
erage can filled with gasoline to burn his girlfriend’s house down.
Police charged Jerome Cobb, 63, of 
6006 NE 39th Blvd., on Sunday with aggravated assault and threatening to discharge a destructive device, ac-cording to a GPD arrest report.
Cobb and his girlfriend, Sharon 
Yvonne Dexter, 49, have been dat-ing for about three months. At about 8 p.m. Sunday , Cobb became upset with Dexter over her drug use and threatened to burn her house down. 
Cobb grabbed a gas can and 
walked out of Dexter’s apartment at Southern Pines Apartments, 4125 SW 17th Place, to a gas station nearby.
When Cobb returned, he sat out-
side the house and poured gasoline 
into a 16-ounce AriZona tea can. Dexter got scared and called police.
GPD arrived to 
find Cobb outside the complex with the 16-ounce can 
filled with gaso-line, according to 
the report.
Police arrested Cobb at 9:21 p.m. 
Sunday and booked him into Alach-ua County Jail later that night.
On Monday night, Cobb remained 
in jail with bond set at  $101,000.

The Bob Graham Center 
for Public Service and Gator 
Coalition for Civic Engage-ment sponsored a UF stop on Bring it to the Table’s tour Friday.
Bring it to the Table is a 
community engagement cam-paign which features online “webisodes” aimed at bridg-ing political divides. The op-portunity fit with the center’s mission of getting people engaged in political conver -sation, said Shelby Taylor, digital and communications director for the center.
Two cameramen and an 
interviewer set up on Turling-ton Plaza for two hours. Bring it to the Table project launcher Julie Winokur sat on one side of a table covered with a blue star-spangled cloth and invit-ed four passing students to sit on the other.
At the start of each roughly 30-minute session, the partici-pants moved a red teapot con-taining a yellow flower from the middle to either side of the table  to show where they fell on the political spectrum.
“The goal is to get people 
self-examining their political discourse,” Winokur said.
They then talked specif-
ics, including governmental funding, party lines and the importance of national candi-dates addressing local issues.
Virginia Stanton, an 
18-year-old exploratory fresh-man, said she was glad she participated.
“It was nice to have my 
opinion heard through a dif-ferent outlet other than a box on a sheet of paper,” she said.Campaign encourages students

An investigation by the Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Office led to the 
arrest of an Archer man accused of molesting a 5-year-old child.Police arrested David Gerald Ev-
ans Jr., 46, of 9526 SW 132nd St., and charged him on Friday with child molestation, according to an ASO arrest report.
On Aug. 26, UF’s Child Protec-
tion Team, conducted an interview with the female  child,  who told interviewers Evans inappropriately touched her while she rode along with him in his golf cart on Aug. 25.
On Friday, Evans talked with de-
tectives at the sheriff’s office. 
During the interview, Evans ad-mitted to police he touched the 
child and said he had been drink-ing that day.
Police ar -
rested Evans at 11:20 a.m. Friday and booked him into the Alachua County Jail later that day.
In May, ASO arrested and 
charged Evans with domestic bat-
tery by strangulation, according to Alachua County Clerk of Courts.
As of Monday night, Evans re-
mained in jail with a bond set at $250,000.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ALEXANDER, N.D. — It took little more 
than a day for 18-year-old Evan Jensen to 
smell opportunity in North Dakota’s booming oil patch.
The recent high school graduate got a whiff 
of himself and his 21-year-old brother, Justin. The two had been sleeping in a pickup while looking for work in the oil fields of western North Dakota.
“We smelled,” he said. “Bad.”Thousands of workers have descended on 
the region to seek their fortune in the oil fields, and housing construction and growth of brick-and-mortar businesses haven’t kept up. The closest shower to Jensen was at a truck stop some 60 miles away . That’s when the idea for a mobile shower 
hit him harder than the reek of his own B.O.
An armada of food trucks and other rov-
ing enterprises was already catering to oilfield workers. The teen believed others would value a hot shower nearly as much as a hot meal.
He pitched the idea to his parents back at 
their farm near Lake Preston in eastern South Dakota. His father and other relatives helped him convert a 53-foot semitrailer into a five-stall shower center with an office and laundry facilities. A 6,000-gallon semi tanker alongside the trailer provides fresh water and collects the greywater.
The venture, called Better Showers, of-
fers $10 showers. “I brainstorm and think of what’s in demand here,” Jensen said. “I’ve got 
a bunch of ideas. All it takes is guts, really.”

Poll Question:
Did Will Muschamp make the right call by naming Jeff Driskel the 
starting quarterback? Vote online at alligatorSports.org. � MUSCHAMP CHOSE DRISKEL BECAUSE OF HIS MOBILITY. 
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Will Muschamp didn’t 
want to name a starting 
quarterback following Sat-urday’s win against Bowling Green, but he decided to end the speculation on Monday by naming Jeff Driskel his starter.
  “It’s been a lifelong 
dream,” Driskel said. “Obvi-ously to be the quarterback at a university like this is a big achievement, but I’m just excited to really be able to take command of the offense. To really hone in on what I got to do and be ready to go to win in Texas A&M.”
  Muschamp said the deci-
sion was not based solely on the quarterbacks’ play against Bowling Green but rather a complete evaluation of everything they had done since spring practices. 
While players and coach-
es maintained throughout spring and fall that Driskel and Jacoby Brissett were even in the quarterback com-petition, Muschamp said he does not plan to pull his starter as soon as something goes wrong.
  “It will be Jeff’s game 
to play,” Muschamp said of Saturday’s Southeastern Conference opener against Texas A&M. 
“I told Jeff, ‘I don’t want 
you looking over your shoul-der, but you need to play well.’”
  Even though Driskel won’t 
be on a short leash, Mus-champ said he has stressed to Brissett the importance of being able to go in at a mo-ment’s notice, adding that Brissett is “one play away” from being the starter.
  “Jacoby will still get reps,” 
Muschamp said. “He’ll be repped at practice and cer-tainly will be ready when called on. I just feel like we needed to get to the turns and reps and the snaps as we move forward.” 
  Driskel was at the helm for 
the entire second half against the Falcons after playing the Gators’ ﬁ  rst two drives. He ﬁ  nished the game 10 of 16 for 114 yards and a touchdown. Brissett played most of the second quarter, completing 3 of 5 passes for 31 yards in three drives.
  Although Muschamp ex-
pressed conﬁ  dence in the team’s chances to win with either quarterback, he said Driskel’s ability to make plays running the ball fac-tored into the decision. Against Bowling Green, Driskel carried the ball three times for 24 yards.
  “It’s nothing Jacoby didn’t 
do,” Muschamp said of his decision. “(I) just feel like Jeff with the legs, gives us some different variables in our of-fense that can help us move forward.”
  Driskel made the longest 
throw of his career when he connected with Frankie Ham-mond Jr. on a 50-yard touch-down pass early in the fourth quarter to extend the Gators’ lead to 10 points. Hammond also praised Driskel’s scram-bling skills.
  “He brings a lot to the ta-
ble,” Hammond said. “He’s a versatile quarterback. Things break down in the pocket, he is able to stretch plays, and he can run the ball as well, and that is something de-fenses will deﬁ  nitely have to respect.”
  When asked what areas 
Driskel could improve after his performance against the Falcons, Muschamp did not offer too many critiques.

  Mike Gillislee showed he has what 
it takes to be a workhorse in Satur-
day’s season opener. Now he has to prove he can hold up through a 12-game season. 
  After Gillislee carried the ball 24 
times for 148 yards and two touch-downs against Bowling Green, coach Will Muschamp said on Monday that he would like for a second option to emerge so UF can keep Gillislee’s touches at a manageable level. 
  Only ﬁ  ve players in the NCAA car-
ried the ball at least 24 times per game last season. 
  Freshman Matt Jones ran the ball 
three times for 17 yards on Saturday, while Omarius Hines had four car-ries for 14 yards and Mack Brown had four carries for 13 yards. 
  “As we move forward, Matt and 
Mack need to separate themselves in some form or fashion to continue to get [Gillislee] the touches we need for him to have in a game,” Muschamp said. 
  
Easley feels ﬁ  ne after opener: Domi-nique Easley admits he had a few but-terﬂ  ies prior to Saturday’s opener. 
  Easley’s ﬁ  rst game back after suf-
fering a left ACL tear against Florida State on Nov. 26 was also his ﬁ  rst game at defensive end, so the junior was understandably anxious. 
  His fears grew momentarily when 
he brieﬂ  y stayed down on the ﬁ  eld af-Gators looking for No. 2 RB  FIRE JOE MORGAN
  Florida coach Will Muschamp named 
Jeff Driskel the starting quarterback on Monday, but that doesn’t mean much.
  The Gators are runners. Muschamp made 
Florida’s commitment to the ground game clear after Saturday’s win against Bowling Green.
  “We need to establish the run,” Mus-
champ said. “You can’t talk about it. You got to be about it and you got to do it. We made the decision going into the game. That’s what we’re going to do.”
  In their season opener, the Gators ran the 
ball with fervor. Florida racked up 42 carries compared to just 21 passing attempts. After Driskel opened the second quarter with a ﬁ  ve-yard completion to Trey Burton, Florida ran the ball on 10 straight plays.
  Mike Gillislee, the go-to workhorse in 
Muschamp’s running back stable, logged a team-high 24 carries for 148 yards on Satur-day.  No UF player car-
ried the ball more than 23 times in a single game last sea-son.
  “However many 
times I have to get the ball, that’s how many times I get the 
ball,” Gillislee said.
  UF can thrive as a run-oriented offense. 
Though unproven, Gillislee is a talented back, and Matt Jones proved effective in a backup role.
  Even Mack Brown and Omarius Hines 
appeared serviceable, but how reliable each player will be over the course of a full season remains to be seen.
  Gillislee may be on pace to surpass his 
preseason predictions of 1,500 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2012, but he will not. And  UF will win with ground game

“We had the one naked (bootleg) on the goal line and had 
a chance to get the ball off,” Muschamp said. “We need to 
get that one off. We had an opportunity to convert that third down and didn’t. 
“Other than that, he took the ball to the right spots. He 
had two drops. Both could have been caught. I think he did some good things, as far as management of what we’re trying to do.”
As Driskel prepares to play at Kyle Field in College Sta-
tion, Texas, on Saturday, he doesn’t expect to be fazed by the crowd of more than 80,000 fans.
His experiences on the road last season have given him a 
good idea of what to expect.
“That’s definitely going to help,” Driskel said of his fresh-
man season. “We’ve played in atmospheres like we’re going to see in Texas A&M.”

With Bowling Green at Florida’s 23-yard 
line and trailing by only 3 points, Marcus Roberson intercepted a Matt Schilz pass on the first play of the fourth quarter. Roberson returned the pick to the UF 47, killing Bowling Green’s momentum and setting up UF’s final touchdown.

for the Gators on Saturday, rushing 24 times for 148 yards and two touchdowns. His average of 6.2 yards per carry in his first game as UF’s No. 1 back dwarfed the four other backs’ combined 3.8 yards per carry.  After dropping a pair 
of passes early in the game, Hammond bounced back to score a 50-yard touchdown — Saturday’s longest play from scrimmage. Hammond finished with three catches for 62 yards.

Jackie Joiner / Alligator Staffthat’s OK.
Florida’s running backs do 
not need to set the world on fire 
this season. They just have to do enough to get the offense moving. 
Bowling Green is a Mid-Amer -
ican Conference squad. The Fal-cons finished 104th nationally in rushing defense last year. Slow-ing down a Southeastern Confer -
ence opponent at all would have been an accomplishment for those guys.
Saturday’s game was merely a 
confidence boost for the Gators’ running backs.But it’s early. As Florida’s inex-
perienced group gains experience and in-game reps, they will only continue to improve.
The departures of Jeff Demps 
and Chris Rainey are a blessing in disguise for the Gators. Finally, UF can return to a regular north-south running game instead of accom-modating speedsters who are use-less running between the tackles on a regular basis.
Sure, trying to ram it down the 
throats of teams like LSU, Georgia and South Carolina may seem like a misguided strategy. But it’s the way things are done in the SEC.
The good teams can pound the 
rock, and the bad teams cannot.When December rolls around, 
Gillislee will not be one of the five players recognized in New York as a Heisman Trophy finalist. Mack Brown will still be known primar -
ily as the Texas coach, Jones will be the fourth-most popular last name in the United States and Hines will be ketchup.
But together, this group of guys 
will be the reason the UF offense is respectable.
Naming a starting quarterback 
is good news for Florida. But if the Gators do anything of note this season, it will be because they are runners.

“It was a scary moment,” Eas-

He notched the team’s only 
sack in the 27-14 win and received positive reviews from Muschamp on Monday.  
“I played alright,” Easley said. 
“I don’t want to say it was my best game.”
Injury updates: Offensive tackle 
Matt Patchan is expected to miss Saturday’s game against Texas A&M with a pectoral injury, but Muschamp is encouraged by his progress. 
“I’m hoping for Tennessee, but I’m not sure of that, either,” Muschamp said. “He’s doing ev-erything he can do to get back. I know that rehab is going well, and everything has been very positive on that end.”
Trainers projected Patchan’s 
recovery time at four weeks. Mus-champ said the healing process is currently ahead of schedule, prompting the team to expect an earlier return.  
A fifth-year junior, Patchan has 
seen action in only 27 games due to a variety of medical issues. 
“I know Matt’s frustrated,” 
Muschamp said. “I’m frustrated for him, because he’s worked extremely hard. He had a really good offseason, so I hope it’s not that much longer. We need to get him back.”
Long snapper Drew Ferris suf-
fered a broken clavicle on Satur -
day, and Muschamp said Kyle Crofoot will assume long snap-ping duties in the interim.

� FLORIDA LAUNCHED A SEASON-HIGH 24 
SHOTS IN SUNDAY’S 3-0 WIN. 
  ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

  After facing two in-state rivals early in the season 
and scoring only one goal, Florida’s offense came 
alive on Sunday against Florida International, scor-ing three goals on 24 shots. 
  “We’ve come a long way since the last time we 
played [at home],” coach Becky Burleigh said. “I was really, really pleased with everything tonight in terms of our ability to generate goal-scoring chanc-es.”
  The Gators’ 24 shots, 10 of which were on goal, 
were a season-high, doubling their previous best of 12 against Florida State on Friday.
  Although Florida tied its season-high goal total, 
the large number of shots displayed the Gators’ lack of efﬁ  ciency on offense Sunday night.
  “That’s the No. 1 thing that the coaches said when 
we came off after the game is, ‘Great game, but if we ﬁ  nished our chances, that really could’ve been a dif-ferent game,’” redshirt senior McKenzie Barney said. Barney scored the second goal against FIU.
  Florida failed to convert several chances on Sun-
day.   Near the end of the game, Barney got a one-on-
one opportunity against FIU goalkeeper Kaitlyn Sav-age, but her shot rolled past the post, missing a goal by a couple of feet.
  Late in the ﬁ  rst half, junior Adriana Leon crossed 
a ball in front of the net and sophomore Annie Speese headed it, but the ball sailed over the net. 
  “[Leon] gave some great balls that should have 
been assists,” Burleigh said. “They were perfectly placed balls that we just didn’t have the ability to get on the end of.”
  The Gators’ most efﬁ  cient shooter Sunday was 
sophomore Havana Solaun. Solaun took four shots; three were on goal and two resulted in scores.
  “We did ﬁ  nd the back of the net, not as much as 
we probably wanted to, but we did what we need to,” Solaun said.
  Solaun nearly tied the game against FSU on Fri-
day. Solaun scored on goalkeeper Kelsey Wys early in the second half, but the referee ruled her offsides.
  Another player who saw a lot of action was soph-
omore Tessa Andujar. Andujar got her ﬁ  rst point of the year when she fed the ball to Solaun for the Gators’ opening goal.
  “She really just hustles for every ball,” Burleigh 
said. “She served some great balls in the box.”
  “We really wanted to come out and show that 
we’re still in this,” Andujar said. “We wanted to come out with a win.” Gators attack finding its groove

  Mary Wise has no doubt that 
her team can attack the ball. But the 
Gators’ defense is full of question marks.
  This past weekend, No. 15 Flori-
da traveled to University Park, Pa., to compete in the Nike Big Four Classic, where losses to No. 4 Texas and No. 8 Stanford revealed the team’s weaknesses. 
  The Gators’ digging in the back 
row was one of Wise’s major con-cerns following the tournament and the exhibition match against the Slovenian Junior National Team on Monday. After Saturday’s match against the Cardinal, Wise said her personnel didn’t match up with those top-10 teams, and her players will have to develop those skills as the year progresses.   “We’re not there yet,” Wise said. 
“We scored enough points to win those, we blocked enough balls, we had enough faces, we had enough kills. We just didn’t keep them from scoring.”
  Florida allowed season-high hit-
ting percentages of .313 and .331 against Texas and Stanford. Al-though the Gators’ offense kept pace for the majority of the weekend’s matches, Wise is still counting on the two primary defensive specialists, Taylor Unroe and Madison Mon-serez, to make Florida a balanced 
squad.
  Both Unroe 
and Monserez said the issue is not skill or abil-ity but chemistry and focus. 
  “Sometimes 
it’s like a discon-nect,” Unroe said. 
“We’ll hesitate for a ball, and I think once we stop hesitating, once we just get to the ball, we can compete with anybody.”
  Even with Kelly Murphy and 
Kristy Jaeckel, who combined for 34 percent of Florida’s digs last year, Florida still ranked 259th out of 321 NCAA teams with 13.59 digs per set. This year, the Gators have only 13.4 digs per set.
  “We have the ability ,” Monserez 
said. “We kind of were a little more laid back and, ‘We’ll get the next one,’ kind of thing. I think in the future we are deﬁ  nitely going to be, ‘We need it now, we need this point.’ We don’t just let balls fall. Ev-ery point is important.”
