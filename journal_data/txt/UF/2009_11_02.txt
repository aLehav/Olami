UF clinches spot in SEC title game

JACKSONVILLE -Urban
Meyer didn't need to call any tim-
eouts.
Even with UF fans chanting
for Meyer to rub in No. 1 Florida's
41-17 win over rival Georgia with
some late timeouts, he passed.
His point had already been
made.
"New helmets and black
pants really aren't go-
ing to make you win the
game. You still have to go
out there and execute."
Ryan Stamper
UF redshirt senior linebacker
UGA coach Mark Richt seemed
to pull out all the motivational
tricks he had: a first-ever uniform
combination that his team didn't
break out until just before kickoff
and a team-wide touchdown cel-
ebration on the sideline, but the
Gators made those ploys to look
like acts of desperation.
"New helmets and black pants
really aren't going to make you
win the game," linebacker Ryan
Stamper said. "You still have to go
out there and execute."
Execute is exactly what Florida
did, and thanks to Tennessee's win

Police say they have identified a sus-
pect in what they originally thought was
an armed robbery near Norman Hall last
month.
Frank R. Edwards, 49, is described as an
aggressive panhandler who has frequently
been seen around campus and downtown
Gainesville, according to a University Po-
lice Department report. Police were able to
located Edwards after receiving calls from
other people who say he approached them.The victim, who told police he was
robbed at gunpoint on Oct. 23 outside Nor-
man Hall, could not identify him from a
photo lineup, however, and could not con-
firm the use of a handgun either, the UPD
report states.
As a result, UPD is reclassifying the in-
cident as a trespass instead of a robbery,
since Edwards had previously been banned
from the UF campus.

UF ADMINISTRATION
Officials: Emergency text
message test successful
UF said it's happy with the
latest test of its emergency mes-
saging system conducted Fri-
day.
The text message, sent a little
after 11 a.m., took just longer
than eight minutes to be sent out
to cell phone carriers, UF spokes-
man Steve Orlando said.
UF was hoping for 10 min-
utes or better, he said.
The last test, which occurred
on Wednesday, took about 23
minutes to be sent out because
of a 14-minute delay caused by
a glitch in the system.
Orlando had said previously
that Friday's test was Black-
board Connect's last chance to
get it right.
"Thank goodness for us and
for them," he said today after
the successful test.
However, not everything
went according to plans.
About 3,600 text messages
weren't able to be sent out, ac-
cording to Orlando.
Almost 1,000 additional num-
bers were deemed invalid, while
more than 61,000 messages were
sent successfully.

Four men visiting Gainesville for
The Fest 8 were arrested after police
say they beat an officer who was try-
ing to arrest a man at a house party
early Sunday morning.
Two officers were driving on
Northwest Eighth Street and found
that a crowd of about 100 people
were blocking the road, dancing
and partying, in front of a house
at Northwest Third Avenue and
Northwest Eighth Street, according
to Gainesville Police Department
spokesman Keith Kameg.
The officers tried to clear the street
using horns and sirens, but one par-
tier refused to move, he said.
As officers tried to arrest him,
Ryan Clarey, 25, tried to pull the
man away and attacked Officer
Steve Jones, Kameg said.-yTasered, but as Jones cuffed Clarey,
onlookers threw rocks and cans
at the officer. About six people
punched and kicked him in the back
of the head, Kameg said.
Another two officers called for
backup and fought the attackers un-
til 20 more units arrived, he said.
Clarey, Joseph Rogers, 21, Jeremy
Allensworth, 23, and Douglas De-
meresti, 26, were arrested for battery
on a law enforcement officer.
Kameg said most people enjoy
The Fest for its music and entertain-
ment, and the men arrestedbelonged
to a "fringe element" who only come
looking for a place to stay.
"Those five people who were ar-
rested were absolute fools," he said.
"They think Gainesville is their per-
sonal toilet. coming from behind

are."
Kameg added that police will be
out in full force in years to come.
"It's not about going to see a

will not be tolerated."A GPD officer Tasers Ryan Clarey, 25, after he attacked an officer while police were breaking up a crowd

Slime took center stage at the Oaks Mall
on Halloween as the UF Department of
Chemistry held its fourth annual Molecu-
lar Mania event on Saturday morning.
The event let children and familieswatch or conduct interactive science ex-
periments.
There was a chance to make slime,
watch marshmallows freeze in liquid ni-
trogen and see milk glow under a fluores-
cent black light.
Assistant professor Adam Veige, who
oversaw Saturday's event, said the chem-istry department holds four community-
based events a year that are run by stu-
dents.
Around Monique Williams,
a biochemistry doctoral
student, ran an experi-
ment displaying non-Newtonian fluid,
which has properties of both a liquid andbe
ard
enough to stop bullets.
Children at the event, which was spon-
sored by the Florida section of the Ameri-
can Chemical Society and the National
Science Foundation, received experiment
checklists that could be entered for a
chance to win either a chemistry set or a
crystal-growing set.

SANTA FE COLLEGE
Trick-or-treaters trade cans for candy at Boo at the Zoo
By ROBERT HILSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Santa Fe College Teaching
Zoo opened its haunted home to
more than 5,000 people for an af-
ternoon of fairy tales and furry tails
Saturday for its 15th annual Boo at
the Zoo.
The crowd, including more than
one Michael Jackson and fewer Tim
Tebows than usual, compelled or-
ganizers to open gates at about 2:30
p.m., 30 minutes before the sched-
uled start time.
The event, which cost one cannedgood for admission, collected neces-
sities for local food banks to distrib-
ute during the holiday season.
In return, dozens of dressed-
up student zookeepers passed out
about 96,000 pieces of candy to
young trick-or-treaters shuffling
from station to station.
Despite a sweaty day of prancing
around as Rapunzel's blood-stained
prince, Darcy Garcenton, a 20-year-
old animal technology major, said
the treat was all hers.
"It's the greatest thing in the
world," she said. "The smiles on the
kids faces? It's ridiculous. But it's"When you go trick-or-treat-
ing, it's usually just candy.

special."

more fun for us than it is for them."
She added that the event brings
in enough food to stock every partic-
ipating food bank for Thanksgiving.
Zoo directorJack Brown, who has
worked at Santa Fe for 35 years andhas overseen every Boo at the Zoo,
said the visitors weren't the only
ones to benefit from the project.
"The monkeys love the colors
and the decorations," he said.
A sawdust-covered trail fun-
neled children carrying pillow cases
through a series of fantasy lands
and ended with an appearance by
Abby Arcane, the distressed vixen
in "Swamp Thing."
Zookeepers played their roles
with smiles, creating a family-
friendly environment that Jennifer
Pichardo, 36, said she appreciated.
"When you go trick-or-treating,it's usually just candy," said Pich-
ardo, mother of a trick-or-treater.
"This adds something special, but I
did have to take my little dinosaur
out of her costume because of the
heat."
Upon exiting, visitors had the
opportunity to suggest a name for
the zoo's 3-month-old capuchin
monkey, whose gender is still un-
known.
Whispers among zookeepers in-
dicate that "Cappuccino" is a popu-
lar suggestion for the baby, whose
mother's name is "Frap"- short for
"Frappuccino."
Psychics give warnings, fortunes to students at Reitz
U THEY WERE PAID $2,000.
By TATIANA QUIROGA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hoping to get a glimpse of their futures
Friday night, about 50 students lined up to
see psychics at the first floor of the Reitz
Union. Three psychics tended to five stu-
dents at a time for 10 minute sessions.
A long line crowded the lobby for most
of the night as students waited for their
turn.
Some students were drawn in by the"We went to the first people in line,
and they said the psychics were coming so
we decided to tag along," said Jillian Mc-
Manus, a materials engineering freshman
who went to Gator Nights! with a friend.
Alan Natochy, a telecommunications
junior, headed to the psychic fair because
his friends were in Jacksonville. He said it
was something to do.
"It was better than I thought it would
be," he said. "It was really interesting."
The psychics would close their eyes
and give him warnings about his future,
he said.
"Who knows if it's real or not, but it'sthe fun of the unknown," Natochy said.
Tonya Dawson, program coordinator
for the Center for Student Activities and
Involvement said each Halloween, Gator
Nights! showcases some kind of psychic
novelty.
"A lot of our attendees
On like that," she said. "If some-Campus thing has an overwhelming
response that is positive, we
like to keep that going."
Patrick Burns, a paranormal researcher
on truTv's "Haunting Evidence," was also
featured Friday night.
Dawson said she found the psychicsthrough GP Entertainment, the company
that Patrick Burns works with. They had
some good reviews at other schools, she
said.
The psychics, like the other novelties
the center brings to Gator Nights!, cost
about $2,000, which covers everything
from travel and lodging to food, Dawson
said.
Michelle Torrey, one of the psychics at
the fair, said she doesn't like to be called a
psychic because of the stereotypes associ-
ated with the term.
"It is a gift, and we don't abuse it," she
said.

'Running Man' dances through Gainesville
By EMILY BLAKE
Alligator Writer
When Tinpothy Gordon runs, he
dances.
"Dancing is when you're feeling
good, when you're feeling hot," said
Gordon, 55. "When I'm dancing, that's
when I'm at my best."
He has been known as Gaines-
ville's "Running Man" for more than
30 years. Often donned in orange and
blue, he is distinguished by the peace
signs he flashes to passers-by, an un-
wavering smile and an ever-extended
left arm he uses to ward off the devil.
Gordon was born in McMeekin,
Fla., a small town east of Gainesville, in
1954. For 15 years, everyone, even his
family, called him Tim. Then, when he
went out for the football team in ninth
grade, he saw his birth certificate.
When his mother saw the name
Tinpothy Odelle Gordon, she thought
it was a mistake. She sent the certifi-
cate back, but a week later, it was re-
turned unchanged.
"Well, that's your name then," his
mother told him with a laugh.
His infatuation with running be-
gan when he tried out for the track
team in high school. He was the an-
chor -the last, fastest runner -of
the mile relay.
Three years later, Gordon's moth-
er -a wholesome, gentle-mouthed
woman who never missed a Sunday
sermon -died of cancer.
"I lost a lot when I lost her," he
said. "I went on a wild goose chase
ever since my mama died."
After high school, Gordon accept-
ed a track scholarship to Lake City
Community College and began hang-
ing with the "wrong crowd."
"I didn't do no good when I was
younger," he said. "All I was do-
ing was partying and having a good
time."
After two years at Lake City, Gor-
don enlisted in the army. He trained
for four years at bases in Germany

alligator to place your ad, call 352-376-4482and North Carolina, but he never
was deployed. When he returned to
Gainesville to live with his brothers in
1979, he was broke.
"I was on the fall," he said. "I was
on the bottom, and I had been on the
top my whole life."
That's when God stepped in.
"He told me I didn't have to worry
because I would be living with my
little brothers and I would be running
again," he said.
After his brother Eddie got him
a job at a health care store at Shands
at UF, Gordon rekindled his love for
running. He ran every day after work,
starting out at three miles per day.
He gradually would increase mileage
each day.
Within six months, he was running
about 25 miles every weekday and
about 30 miles a day on weekends. His
route included running on the side of
Interstate 75 until the police forced
him to stop for his own safety.
"I was getting back to the old Tim
Gordon again," he said.
Then, on a quiet Monday morning
in 1980, Gordon's life was disheveled.
While clocking in at work, he was
pinned up against the wall and ar-
rested for dealing stolen property of
Shands, including a blood pump ma-
chine and three packages of Pampers.
He was quickly proven innocent but
was left unemployed to live on social
security income and food stamps.
"Whatever a poor man gets, that's
all I get," he said.
For almost a year, he lived in a
rooming house, struggling to pay rent
by the week, sometimes eating only
bologna and bread, but not a day went
by that he didn't run.
"I didn't let nothing stop me from
running," he said. "No matter how
difficult it got, I still ran."
Gordon started competing in mar-
athons in 2006.
"The marathon is my favorite
[race]," he said. "It gives me the most
time to dance."His best time was four hours and
15 minutes, which he ran in 2006.
Gordon's legs aren't as strong as
they were 30 years ago, and his endur-
ance isn't as good. Now, he runs about
10 miles a few days a week.
But Gordon said he's ready to run
the race of his life at his next marathon
in February. He hopes to break the
four-hour mark, but he'll be happywith any outcome.
"I'm trying to do my best for the
Lord," Gordon said. "I didn't do God
too good when I was younger."
Running takes him back to when
he had no worries. When he's run-
ning, he can conquer anything. So
whenever he feels up to it, he laces
up his worn-down shoes, puts out his
arm and begins to dance.

Do It Reitz
UF should think before
expanding student union
planning begins for the renovation and possible
expansion of the Reitz Union, UF administrators
and the Student Government must take care not to
alienate students and faculty who are facing tough times.
Audacious plans for a "new Reitz Union" stand in stark
contrast with UF's economic realities. Budget cuts that
have plagued the university recently have led to program
reductions and layoffs.
Stimulus funds have plugged much of that hole, but
these funds are limited. Unless President Bernie Machen
was right in predicting that there will be no additional
budget cuts this spring or beyond, more pain may be
ahead.
Even assuming no additional cuts will be made, the
current budget is only sustainable after 15 percent annual
tuition increases under the state's differential tuition pro-
gram. This means more money out of students' pockets.
In the face of increasing costs, SG and university ad-
ministrators, namely Reitz Union executive director Eddie
Daniels, are seeking a $42.5 million renovation of the Reitz
Union. In addition, the proposed Reitz Union expansion
could cost as much as $56 million, according to Unite Par-
ty President Joey Regalado.
Ridding the Reitz Union Hotel of asbestos and updating
the plumbing and lighting systems, all part of the planned
renovation, is reasonable enough. While expensive, Dan-
iels argues that these updates need to be made soon.
Unfortunately, money generated from sales at the
union and the Activity & Services fee students pay as part
of tuition will not cover the renovations. Daniels is seeking
funds from other areas of the university.
Why sink tens of millions of dollars into a new building
when revenue will not cover the updates needed for the
existing one? Even if private or state funding can be found
for the expansion, it is unlikely to cover the entire cost,
and students will likely foot the bill.
The proposed expansion, which would include a "cul-
tural village" and may be built on what is now the parking
lot across from the current location, is clearly not the best
use of SG or university funds.
The Reitz Union is aging fast, and at 42 years, it is clear-
ly not the pinnacle of modernity that the expansion may
aspire to be.
But it works, and it is not often used to capacity; many
empty rooms and hallways can be found at the Reitz.
The Unite Party, which maintains the majority of the
Student Senate after recent elections, established the ex-
pansion as a key part of its platform, including "a new
Reitz Union" in a short list of goals on its Web site.
We understand that this goal was set in good faith, but
we hope that the Unite Party, SG and UF administrators
take the increasing costs of tuition into account when de-
ciding whether to go through with the expansion.
A new, modern Reitz Union would be a great addition
to the UF campus, but as students will likely bare much of
the cost for renovations to the current facility, now is not
the most appropriate time.
Rather, SG funds should be directed at increasing the
quality and frequency of events held at the Reitz Union to
make the most of what we have.

Column
Web has become double-edged sword
orty years ago, Leonard Kleinrock sent the first mes-sage over what is now known as the Internet. The
message -the word "log" -was to be sent from a
computer terminal at University of California, Los Ange-
les to another terminal at the Stanford University Research
Institute, but it wasn't a complete success.
Kleinrock, now 75, recently reminisced about the first
attempted message in an interview with CNN, explaining
how at the very end of typing in the word "log," SRI's
host crashed: "So the very first message ever on the Inter-
net was the very simple, very prophetic 'lo,' as in lo and
behold."
Lo and behold to say the least. In the 40 years since that
first message, the Internet has profoundly shaped not only
the day-to-day lives of billions around the world but the
very structure of world society.
The early proselytizer of the Internet, former Vice
President Al Gore -who, no, did not invent the Internet
-should still be credited with advancing the idea of the
Internet as a technology for the masses. When he spear-
headed the High Performance Computing and Communi-
cation Act of 1991 as a senator, Gore envisioned a future
of "information superhighways," but who knew then how
accurate his vision was.
Information now races through cyberspace, or a "series
of tubes," as former Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, called it,
at speeds unimagined just a few years ago. No longer is the
Web just a separate tool for finding and sharing informa-
tion -it is a complete extension of our lives. A question I
feel compelled to ask, now, is whether we've given it too
much power over our political and government structure.
Consider this: Barack Obama would have most likely
not been elected president a year ago if not for the Inter-
net and his campaign's ability to capitalize on the social
networking aspect of it. "Obamamania" didn't spread
through barbershops and small town diners; it spreadvirally through broadband cable
wires, surfacing in message boards
and on Facebook.
This was, I believe, the first con-
crete example of the true power
of the Internet. The Web finally
Matthew Christ showed itself to us as a means to ac-
letters@alligator org complish political ends.
__ttr________ror And with this power comes in-
credible responsibility. The Web has
been used up to this point for just as incredible purposes:
It has served as the great equalizer, allowing anyone from
anywhere to share ideas, information and opinion. It has
streamlined production and even made us safer. It is an
unremitting reminder of the power of human thought and
our capacity to change the world one person at a time.
Only the Internet rivals the untamed vastness of the
human mind, and as much promise it has -to accelerate
free expression and to celebrate popular culture and po-
litical visions -it has increasingly fallen prey to the worst
aspects of humanity, namely the desire to support every
crazy idea living in the dark crevices of our brains.
At the height of this summer's crazy parade, no one was
safe from the Internet. No matter your political affiliation,
the Birthers were by far the most cockamamie of the sum-
mer if not for their belief that the president of the United
States wasn't born in the country, but because their stead-
fast beliefs were quick to be supported by gonzo "facts"
found on the Internet.
Forty years on and the Internet has come to a cross-
road. One road leads to a tool that propagates our greatest
thoughts, and the other leads to an echo chamber of our
worst.
Lo and behold.

College defends
are grateful to the many north central
Florida residents who have supported
our expanded news talk and public af-
fairs programming on WUFT-FM.
Consistent with our educational mission, stu-
dents are also experiencing the benefits of these op-
portunities. WUFT-FM's invitation to broadcast an
upcoming health care forum at the Graham Cen-
ter and the recent station open house, which drew
more than 300 students, are just two examples.
The College of Journalism and Communications
has submitted a concept proposal to create a local,
daily Spanish-language news and public affairs
program. If approved, this new service will reach
a vastly under-served community in our region.
Programs such as "Talk of the Nation," "Market-
place" and the student-produced "Front Page on
the Air" are staples of the news talk channel.format change
Paul Gordon We've also expanded
Speaking Out classical arts programmingpea ing __to a 24/7 format. We're
planning local programs,
including an upcoming holiday series of school
and community musical performances. As our fall
pledge drive continues this week, our commitment
to news talk and public affairs programming is un-
wavering. We're delighted to know so many north
central Florida residents support our commitment.
The need for accurate, timely, balanced and rel-
evant local and national information is greater than
ever. We're in a unique position to provide this in-
valuable service to our listeners. We view it as a call
of duty in a democratic society.

Sanger unfairly represented
I was alarmed by the one-sided
discussion of Planned Parenthood
and Margaret Sanger in Thurs-
day's Alligator article. Margaret
Sanger was not a eugenist, a rac-
ist or an anti-Semite and was in no
way affiliated with Nazi ideology.
In fact, Sanger's books were of the
first to be burned by the Nazis, as
they contradicted their anti-fam-
ily-planning agenda. Addition-
ally, Sanger consistently stated that
family planning decisions should
be made on an individual basis, not
on a social or cultural basis, which
of course directly contradicts core
eugenics ideology.
Planned Parenthood absolutely
does not "target" any specific pop-
ulation for abortion. Planned Par-
enthood clinics are vital communi-
ty providers of basic health care for
all people and additionally serve as
a low-cost resource for uninsured
men, women and teens. More than
97percent of the work Planned Par-
enthood does is preventative. This
includes cervical cancer screen-
ings, breast exams, STI testing and
treatment, patient education, birth
control services, men's health ser-
vices, pregnancy tests and even
prenatal and pediatric care. Vox:
Voices for Planned Parenthood, the
campus liaison to Planned Parent-
hood, continuously holds events
on campus and in the community
to increase awareness about sexual
health care. We would love for the
Pro-Life Alliance to join us in our
efforts to decrease the number of
both unintended pregnancies and
abortions through educating our
peers about safer sex practices and
contraceptive use. Prevention is
our No. 1 goal.
UF junior Andrew Scheuer-
mann brings up an important is-sue with his comment, "I think it
would be horrible if it was true, but
I don't believe it." Far too many
anti-choice groups are using scare
tactics similar to those used in the
Pro-Life Alliance's demonstration
to get their message out there. It is
truly dangerous in today's society
to use misinformation for personal
gain, especially when we're talking
about something as important as
health care.

Music deserves some air time
I would like to respond to let-
ters from Gene Cowell and Mea-
gan Gregory approving of the re-
cent changes to WUFT-FM's radio
schedule. Although I'm happy that
some new NPR programming has
been introduced, such as "Wait
Wait.Don't Tell Me" and "This
American Life," in other respects
the changes have been for the
worse for anyone with an appreci-
ation of music. Classical music has
been shunted off to HD radio, and
jazz has gone away altogether.
I'm not advocating a complete
return to the way things were, but
it would sure be nice to hear some
jazz on Friday evenings again, and
something other than the BBC
World News every night between
11 p.m. and 6 a.m. I certainly have
not found any other radio stations
in our community offering classical
music or quality jazz programming
(smooth jazz doesn't count). Maybe
a 50/50 split between news/com-
mentary and music on the regular
(non-HD) broadcast would be a
better ratio for most listeners.

search papers, theses and pre-

The couple also falsely
claimed to have a state-of-the-
art analysis and data commu-
nication laboratory, and that
their company, New Era Tech-
nology, or NETECH, had a
partnership with UF's Innova-
tion Nuclear Space Power and
Propulsion Institute.
Some of the work that was
supposed to have been done
by NETECH was actually work
done at UT and a lab in Russia,
according to the U.S. Attor-
ney's office.
The couple is accused of us-
ing hundreds of thousands of
dollars of the illegally obtained
money to buy land and cars.
According to the indict-
ment, they also gave some of
the money to their sons.
The charges against them
are: conspiracy to commit wire
fraud, 50 counts of wire fraud,
conspiracy to commit money
laundering, 17 counts of mon-
ey laundering and one count ofmaking false statements to the
government, according to the
U.S. Attorney's Office.
In a separate count, Sousan
Anghaie is charged with mak-
ing false statements.
If convicted, they face up to
20 years in prison on each of
the conspiracy, wire fraud and
money laundering charges, and
up to five years for each of the
charges of making false state-
ments, according to the office.
The Anghaies and their
Gainesville-based company
were the target of a federal in-
vestigation that included the
search of Samim Anghaie's UF
office by the FBI in February.
On Thursday, the court or-
dered the forfeiture of six prop-
erties, as well as several bank
accounts and vehicles, on the
basis that they were purchased
with money earned from the
fraudulent grants.
UF placed Samim Anghaie
on leave immediately after
learning of the investigation in
February, cutting off his access
to funding, awards and univer-
sity resources, according to a
statement released by the uni-
versity on Friday.

Florida focuses on defense as exhibition play begins
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
When asked what Florida
needs to improve defensively
this season, Dan Werner smiled
and gave a simple answer.
"Hopefully stop people a
little more than we did last
year," the team's lone senior
said. "That's probably what
we've got to try doing."
The Gators finished a re-
spectable fifth in scoring de-
fense in the SEC last year, giv-
ing up 67.4 points per game,
but the real 0
problem can
be seen in
how well
other teams
shot against
them.
UF fin-
Donovan shed 11thin the SEC
in field-goal defense, allowing
opponents to shoot 44.4 per-
cent from the field and ninth in
defending the three-point line,
yielding a 35.1 percentage.
"We have not defended the
3-point line," UF coach Billy
Donovan said at the team's
media day. "We've always
had a great differential in us
defending the three and tak-
ing threes, and it was the other
way around. Teams shot a
way higher percentage than
we did." Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

UF takes home fourth-consecutive SEC title
By TYLER JETT

The Southeastern Conference still revolves
around Gainesville.
With six wins in its last seven matches,
No. 10 Florida (14-4-2, 8-1-2 SEC) emerged
from the middle of the pack to win its fourth-
straight regular season SEC Championship
on Friday. Top-seeded UF faces eighth-seed-
ed Tennessee in the first round of the SEC
Tournament on Wednesday.
The team's last win of the regular season
came against No. 13 South Carolina (15-3-1,
7-3-1 SEC), which is experiencing one of its
best seasons in school history, including a
12-0 start.
"Our assistant coach, Vic Campbell, said
it best when he said, 'There are a lot of teamsthat are in this position every year, but Flor-
ida is the constant,"' coach Becky Burleigh
said.
Unlike last season, when the Gators were
unbeaten in conference play, UF was in a
must-win situation, as South
Carolina and LSU entered
Friday just one point behind
Florida.
Soccer t"This is what you come
to Florida for," Burleigh said
to her team before the game.
"This is what you have all those hard Tues-
days for. This is what you have a hard sum-
mer B for. All the stuff you work for comes to
one night when you have a chance to put a
ring on your finger."
South Carolina pressured Florida early in
the game, but two McKenzie Barney first-halfgoals wrecked the Gamecocks' confidence.
Barney's first goal came in the 20th minute
after she rebounded an Erika Tymrak shot off
the high crossbar. South Carolina goalkeep-
er Mollie Patton was out of position as she
had tried to stop Tymrak's shot, and Barney
scored effortlessly from four yards out.
"It came right to me," Barney said. "If
I wouldn't have scored that, I don't know
what I would've done."
Tymrak also assisted on Barney's second
goal after she stole the ball from a South
Carolina player in the Gamecocks' defensive
third and brought the ball inside the penalty
box.
Tymrak crossed the ball to Barney, who
shook a defender with some sidesteps and
put the ball in the bottom right corner of the

Lowe's win leads UF women to SEC Championship
* THE SOPHOMORE SAT OUT
LAST YEAR D U E TO I NJ U RY
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
With a Southeastern Conference
title back in Gainesville for the first
time since 1997, the No. 5 women's
team will now focus on the NCAA
Regional Championship and NCAA
Championship meets in the upcom-
ing weeks.Rebecca Lowe finished in first
place during the SEC Championship
on Saturday in Oxford, Miss., with
a time of 20:57.35. Lowe finished in
ninth place during the NCAA Pre-
Nationals with her personal-best
time of 20.51.1 during her first race
of the season. She sat out for the 2008
season due to injury.
"This title means a lot to us," the
redshirt sophomore said. "It's been
a long time coming for the Gators
and we are proud to bring a cham-
pionship back to Gainesville."Lowe came in first place for the
first time in her UF career. She be-
came the fourth Gator to win a SEC
Cross
Cou ntryindividual title, and
it is the first time
the women's team
has had an individ-
ual champion since
Becki Wells in 1996.
Four other
Gators finished in
the top 10 including junior Charlotte
Browning, who came in second;
fifth-place finisher Stacey Johnson;sophomore Genevieve LaCaze fin-
ished in seventh; and senior Julie
Northrup came in ninth.
"Everyone at the meet gave it
their best, and our women ran tre-
mendously," coach Todd Morgan
said. "It was really great to see Re-
becca succeed. She is a big-time tal-
ent, and she really showed it."
The women's team finished with
24 points, while second place Ten-
nessee had 80 and third place Ar-
kansas had 87.
Lowe, Browning, Johnson andLaCaze were named to the first-
team All-SEC, and Northrup was
chosen for the second-team.
The women were expected to
win the SEC Championship accord-
ing to coaches during a preseason
poll in August.
The men's team, as predicted by
the same poll in August, finished its
8K race in fourth place, behind Ala-
bama, Arkansas and Auburn.
Senior Justin Taylor came in 10th
place and was named to the second-
team All-SEC men's team.
PHIL, from page 13
coach Dan McCarney, who has been around
college football since 1977. "I had hair stand-
ing up on the back of my neck. There were
goose bumps up and down my arms. I've been
around this for a long time. I've heard a lot of
coaches talk and I've heard myself talk a lot,
too much. I thought he did an unbelievable job.
I was ready to go play Friday night."
It's hard to argue with the performance
that ensued. Tim Tebow returned to form, the
defense put on another clinic and UF's special
teams continue to shine.
Georgia may not have been the biggest test,
but it was the first time Florida dominated in a
SEC game in a while, and it clinched a spot for
the Gators in their second consecutive confer-
ence title game.
But you never would've known that Sun-
day night.
Right guard Mike Pouncey was asked about
his reaction to Florida clinching the SEC East,
and he acted like he didn't even know, saying
Student Government presents.he thought UF had to beat Vanderbilt to do it.
McCarney backed up what Pouncey was
saying.
"The word 'Atlanta' didn't even come up
in the team meeting tonight, didn't even come
up," McCarney said. "Vanderbilt did. Our per-
formance yesterday (did).
"We've had some hard lessons a year ago,
some hard lessons this year. You learn from
them. You see what happens around college
football. You see what happens in the SEC."
And while some of it may sound politically
correct, I'm hard-pressed to not believe these
two. These Gators know the true goal for this
season: an undefeated season.
It's been a rough road through eight games
for Florida.
Each game has seemingly led to more ques-
tions than answers, but for once, there seems to
be few criticisms.
"Everybody says you gotta chill out, have
fun and relax, make sure these kids are having
fun," Meyer said. "When you do what we do,
there's one way to have fun -that's go sing
that fight song after the game."Gators tally third-straight shutout
SOCCER, from page 13
net.
The Gators added a third goal in
the 88th minute when midfielder
Holly King headed a Lauren Hyde
free kick into the goal.
But with the way UF's defense has
played lately, the Gators only needed
Barney's first goal to win the game as
the team recorded its third-straight
shutout.
The Gators' backline mirrored the
Gamecocks for the whole match, and
South Carolina's only good oppor-
tunities came in the first half when
Hyde and defender Kat Williamson
committed fouls in their own defen-sive third.
"We knew they weren't going to
score in the run of play, but their set
pieces were a big factor for them on
scoring (chances) in the first half, so
we knew we had to keep that to a
minimum in the second," said Hyde,
who will leave Gainesville with four
SEC titles.
To get that last ring, Hyde and the
rest of the Gators went 3-0 in three
must-win games, something she
thinks will help the team in the post-
season.
"This is a good segue into the
(SEC) tournament, where it's must-
win, and the NCAA Tournament,
where it's must-win or you're done,"
Hyde said.

JACKSONVILLE -Florida line-
backer A.J. Jones had a nightmare
start to a dream game against Geor-
gia on Saturday.
With 10:40 remaining in the sec-
ond quarter, UGA quarterback Joe
Cox floated a 26-yard touchdown
pass to tight end Aron White with
Jones a step too slow in coverage,
cutting UF's lead to 14-10.
"I told all of them I was going to
make up for it, and that's what hap-
pened," Jones said.
The Gators led 24-10 with theBulldogs getting the ball back after
halftime. On Georgia's first offen-
sive snap, Jones made the play of
the game.
Cox dropped back in the pocket,
and Jones came through the middle
on a blitz, tipped the pass in the air
and made a diving interception at
the UGA 19-yard line.
"I didn't know where (the ball)
was, to tell you the truth," Jones
said. "I thought it was batted down,
so I looked down at the ground. It
wasn't there, so I looked up in the
air, and it was right there. They got
on me saying I should have stayed
on my feet and gotten a pick-six."UF quarterback Tim Tebow
turned it into a score, punching in
his second rushing touchdown of
the game three
plays later.
Georgia had
success moving
the ball much
of the day, but
the momentum
was suddenly
too much for theJones Bulldogs to over-
come. Jones' athletic play was just
the beginning.
The redshirt junior added an-
other interception with 1:22 left inlinebacker Ryan Stamper picked
off Cox for UF's third interception
after UGA receiver A.J. Green was
hit hard on a ball delivered over the
middle of the field, creating another
tipped interception.
"I just can't get my hands on the
ball," Stamper said of his first career
interception. "I finally got one. Ma-
jor Wright had a great hit -hit him,
knocked the ball up -and I just
dove for it."
Sophomore Caleb Sturgis add-
ed a 44-yard field goal on the next
drive, extending the lead to 34-17.
Senior middle linebacker Bran-
don Spikes, who returned to the
field after missing UF's last sevended
er.
UUA coach Mark Richt inserted
backup quarterback Logan Gray
into the game, and Spikes picked
him off on the Bulldogs' 5-yard line,
walking the ball into the end zone
untouched.
The Gators scored a combined 17
points off the four interceptions.
"That was sweet. That was sweet
to see," Tebow said. "Just putting
a nail in the coffin. Especially for
what he's been going through, too.
For him to finish this Georgia rivalry
like that, because of his injuries, he's
just so competitive. He wants to be
out there all the time, and it has been
hard for him because he hasn't been
able to."
Tebow breaks record
FOOTBALL, from page I
game we have played this year on offense, defense and special
teams," Stamper said.
UF quarterback Tim Tebow returned to his normal form,
completing 15 of 21 passes for 164 yards and two touchdowns.
He was also the game's top rusher, gaining 85 yards and two
touchdowns on 18 carries.
His first score on the ground, a 23-yard dash up the middle,
broke UGA legend Herschel Walker's SEC record for career
rushing touchdowns, a mark even Tebow had to pause and
take notice of.
On his way back to the sideline, Tebow asked an official
for the game ball for the second week in a row, so he would
have the footballs from the record-tying and record-breaking
scores.
"It's a great record," Tebow said. "It's very humbling, and
I think it will be even more rewarding the further I get away
from college and the longer I live, just because Herschel owned
that record. It will mean a lot."
He admitted after the game that questions surrounding the
offensive play-calling, receivers and his decision-making were
grating on his nerves. Fair or not, that criticism provided the
impetus for an improved performance this weekend, one that
Tebow hopes will be the rule, not the excep-
tion.
"I think I take it on myself, the criticism of
[offensive coordinator Steve Addaziol, the criti-
Football cism of the offensive line, the receivers," Tebow
said. "And I think a lot of that can be changed
by how I play, too. So I think this game started us in a little bit
of a new direction."
Tebow bolstered his chances for a second Heisman Trophy,
spreading the ball to six different wideouts and converting five
third-down attempts with his legs.
Riley Cooper was the standout receiver with four catches for
78 yards and two touchdowns, including a diving, one-handed
grab for a 29-yard score in the first quarter.
Cooper outshined UGA's A.J. Green, the SEC's top receiver,
who was held to his worst outing of the season (three catches,
50 yards).
In fact, UF's linebackers made more catches than Green. A.J.
Jones tallied two interceptions while Stamper and Brandon
Spikes added one each, and Spikes returned his 5 yards for a
touchdown.
"We knew [UGA quarterback Joe Cox] would throw where
he was looking, and we just got pressure on him," Jones said.
"Our D-line helped us out a lot, so did the blitzes and [defen-
sive coordinator Charlie Strong's] scheme. We were just in the
right place at the right time."
Having already accomplished their stated goal of reaching
the conference title game, the Gators will be playing for an un-
defeated season in remaining games against Vanderbilt, South
Carolina, Florida International and Florida State.
An unblemished record wasn't enough to satisfy Florida
prior to Saturday, but the Gators should be flying high after
their win against Georgia.
"We were undefeated, we just didn't feel like we had played
up to our potential yet," Spikes said. "We came out and did a
great job today."<0Georgia 17

SWAMP STUDS
Welcome back, Mr. Tebow. It's been a while since
No. 15 looked like himself, but he came back in re-
S cord-breaking fashion in his hometown, eclipsing7 Herschel Walker's SEC rushing touchdown mark.
He also managed to finish the game turnover-free
Tim for the first time in four weeks. We never thought
Tebow something like that would be a surprise, but Tebow
QB, Sr. will certainly get a longer look by Heisman voters
after this Cocktail Party performance.
15-21 passing, 164 yds, 2 TDs; 18 rush, 85 yds, 2 TDs
It seemed like Jones was all over the field after
halftime Saturday. His tip and diving interception
on Georgia's first possession of the second half
led to a touchdown and a three-score lead for
Florida. He may not always get the praise of the
other starting linebackers, but Jones showed A.J. Jones
he's very worthy of being on the field with Ryan LB, R-Jr.
Stamper and Brandon Spikes.
5 tackles (2 solo), 2 INT, 2 tackles for loss (1
sack), 1 pass breakup
If the game ended after Florida's first two posses-
sions Saturday, there's no doubt Cooper would've
been a unanimous top Swamp Stud. He had a
touchdown grab on each of the Gators' first two
drives, and his second one -a 29-yard one-
Riley handed grab that stood up to video replay -was
Cooper one of the sickest catches we've ever seen. UrbanWR, Sr. Meyer has touted Riley as an NFL-caliber receiver
all season, and maybe he has a point after all.

Murphy's back-to-back triple-doubles lead to pair of wins
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achiang@alligator org
Last season Kelly Murphybroke the school
record for most triple-doubles in a career, this
season she broke the school record for most
triple-doubles in one weekend.
She finished this weekend with two triple-
doubles in as many matches.
Murphy's big performances helped lead
No.10 Florida (18-3, 12-2 Southeastern Con-
ference) to two conference wins over the
weekend including a hard-fought sweep of
Mississippi State 3-0 (25-23, 27-25, 25-22) on
Sunday.
She made it look easy against the Bulldogs
with 11 kills, 25 assists and 10 digs, notching
her NCAA-leading seventh triple-double ofthe season.
But the victory didn't come as simple.
Mississippi State (6-19, 2-13 SEC) kept the
first set close and nearly won the second set
as fatigue started to factor in for the Gators.
"They extended the rallies but I do think
we looked a little gassed, and that's some-
thing we'll have to address as a staff," coach
Mary Wise said. "It's a point in the season
where there really is no rest."
After finding itself trailing 17-23 in the sec-
ond set, UF needed four kills by sophomore
outside hitters Kristy Jaeckel and Colleen
Ward late in the frame to storm back.
Mississippi State bounced back and
pushed Florida to the brink once more in the
final set until the Gators used two straight
points to win after being up 23-22.
Jaeckel posted 10 kills and 13 digs for adouble-double.
"I give Kristy a lot of credit," Wise said.
"She was right there just one behind Elyse in
digs. We ask a whole lot out of her."
Wise said the most im-
portant player in the match
was junior opposite hitter
Lauren Bledsoe, who tallied
11 kills on only 14 swings
despite playing sparingly
since the loss against LSU
on October 11.
Murphy "It's not easy to start
and to not start, but we
just thought it was a good matchup for her
in terms of what Lauren does best," Wise
said. "I couldn't be more proud of Lauren in
the way she has responded and how she has
taken advantage of her playing time."On Friday, UF once again was able to find
a way to sweep an opponent despite being
challenged throughout the match as it beat
Alabama (7-17, 5-9 SEC) in straight sets (25-
20, 25-22, 33-31).
Murphy notched a triple-double that
night with 10 kills, 23 assists and 15 digs, and
Jaeckel's match-high 16 kills led the Gators to
the win.
Senior libero Elyse Cusack dug up a sea-
son-high 24 balls Friday in one of her best
matches of the season.
For the first time in eight matches the
Gators were outblocked, as the Crimson Tide
won the blocking battle 6-3.
After winning six straight matches and 18
straight sets, UF still controls its conference
destiny as Florida is just one match behind
first place.
New personnel should allow Florida to press, play man-to-man more
HOOPS, from page 13_
Oct. 16, the Gators have placed a
greater focus on shoring up some
defensive problems that plagued
them last season. They will get their
first chance to work out some of
the kinks tonight at 7 in an exhibi-
tion game against Saint Leo in the
O'Connell Center.
Although UF's offensive num-
bers were fairly impressive last sea-
son -the team averaged 77.1 points
per game, third in the Southeastern
Conference -its defense was con-
sistently a cause for concern.The Gators went 21-3 last year
when they held opponents under
70 points, but they finished 4-8
when they gave up more than 70.
This year, UF will look to focus
on becoming a stronger defensive
team, a goal aided first and fore-
most by its new personnel. The
projected starting lineup -Erving
Walker, Kenny Boynton, Werner,
Alex Tyus and Vernon Macklin -
creates a more traditional team and
won't force Donovan to enter every
game planning around his team's
inherent disadvantages.
"The most reliable guys for us
in our frontcourt (last season) wereDan and Alex, and it was pretty
clear playing man-to-man that
those guys were going to be in sig-
Men's
Basketball
our frontcourt."nificant foul trou-
ble," Donovan
said. "So we tried
to do some things
defensively to re-
ally camouflage
our lack of size
and strength in
The added numbers and ver-
satility in the frontcourt will allow
Donovan to press more and at-
tempt to play more man-to-man de-
fense, something he felt he couldn'tdo last year given his players' poor
conditioning and lack of depth.
Werner was particularly afflict-
ed by UF's scarcity of able-bodied
big men, as he was forced to guard
opposing power forwards and cen-
ters while playing more minutes
than Donovan felt he should.
Despite that, Werner made the
best of the situation. He finished
third on the team last year with 42
steals, and as the consensus best de-
fender on the team, according to his
coaches and teammates.
Donovan attributed the 6-foot-8
forward's defensive success to his
awareness and ability to see what'scoming and said he would have no
problem playing Werner at any po-
sition because of that.
This season, Werner will likely
