The Hippodrome State Theatre’s most suc-
cessful show is returning to the Mainstage af-
ter a three-year hiatus.
Attracting an audience of 21,000 in 2006, “The Great American Trailer Park Musical,” opens Friday at 8 p.m. 
“The show is better than ever,” said Jessica 
Thompson, director of marketing at the Hip-podrome. 
Based on a fictional trailer park in Starke 
named Armadillo Acres, the musical takes the 
audience through a whirlwind of problems beginning with the arrival of Pippi, a runaway 
stripper who has an affair with one of the resi-dents. With three members from the original cast returning for the show, Mark Chambers, Catherine Fries Vaughn and Kelly Atkins, the show is expected to be a huge hit once again, Thompson said.
“It has a big beginning and a big ending,” Thompson said. “People will love it.”
The show will run every day of the week, 
except Mondays, until July 12.
Tickets range from $25 to $30 for general 
audience members, $20 for seniors and $12 for college students with a valid ID. Starke resi-dents can purchase $12 tickets with proof of 
residency. ‘Trailer Park’ show returns to Hippodrome
� BOOTING FEE IS $16 LESS THAN 
TOWING A CAR.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Parking illegally in Midtown may result in 
a boot instead of a tow, and some say it’s for the better.
Recent changes in the towing policy at the 
UF Plaza, 1702 W. University Ave., have frus-trated some merchants in the area, but others argue that booting is preferable to drivers.
Parking Solutions, the towing company that 
patrols the lot, switched from towing cars in the lot to booting about seven weeks ago.
Kevin Witesides, owner of Parking Solu-
tions, points out that booting is less expensive than towing but still acts as deterrent.
The booting fee is $60 versus $76 for towing.  
Booting also reduces the chances of damaging the vehicle, a problem often associated with towing, he said. 
When getting towed, people can incur up 
to a $300 fee, Witesides said. Beyond the initial Car booting

Students may get more time to 
think up a good excuse when con-
testing city parking tickets. 
If the City of Gainesville decides 
to pass a change in the code of ordi-nances at today’s City Commission meeting at 1 p.m. in City Hall, driv-
ers will have more time to respond to a denied parking ticket petition.
Under the revised section of 
Appendix A of the ordinances, a person would have four additional  work days to respond to a denial of his or her original appeal.  
Previously, 
the response time included weekends and 
holidays.
The City proposed to increase 
the response time after a citizen wrote a letter saying that by the 
time they received the instructions 
to appeal, the response time had run out, said Ronald Combs, senior assistant city attorney.
One UF student believes that 
people appeal parking tickets be-cause it is hard to find authorized parking in the city. 
“The way they made Gainesville, 
there isn’t much space for parking, especially in the downtown area around UF,” said Chris Hillhouse, a UF student.

After 40 years in prison, man stabs two
A man was arrested Sunday night after 
stabbing two people in Gainesville’s Tent 
City, a homeless community.
Kenneth Griffin, 65, was wandering near 
the tent of Ronnie Brannock, 40, when Bran-nock got upset that there was a stranger at the campsite. The men got into an argument, and Griffin punched Brannock. 
While Griffin and Brannock were fight-
ing, Brannock called for his neighbor, Wil-liam Josey, 39, said Keith Kameg,  Gainesville Police Department spokesman. When Josey came out to try to stop the fight, Griffin stabbed Josey multiple times in the chest.
“Witnesses said they thought he was 
punching Josey because of the way it looked, but Griffin was really stabbing him,” Kameg said. He said Griffin also stabbed Brannock once in the back. Brannock and Josie were taken to Shands.
Kameg said Griffin has served 40 years 
in prison for murdering three people.

relatives will take the stage as 
The All Star Jams, which includes at least 15 members, includ-ing Diddley’s grandson Garry 
Mitchell “Philosopher G,” who 
performs positive rap music. 
Bo influenced all of the fam-

On Friday, Gainesville will 
also honor Diddley during this week’s Free Friday at Bo Diddley Plaza with a concert by The All Star Jams and remarks from city 
officials. 
“He has done so much for 
the Gainesville community and 
the homeless during his lifetime. He deserves this,” Kelly said. “Diddley was constantly trying to help the homeless, whether it was donations or free concerts.”

Men admit to stealing Jesus
SOMERSET, Ky. (AP) — A 
Christmas prank in a small Ken-
tucky town has netted jail time for two young men who stole the baby Jesus.
Nicholas A. Brainard, who is 
21, and 19-year-old David A. Gi-aldini were sentenced Monday to 45 days in jail and two years of probation on their guilty pleas to stealing a baby Jesus from a Som-erset family’s Nativity scene in December.
Police found the statue, other 
stolen Christmas decorations and a street sign in the men’s apart-ment. They were charged with misdemeanors — theft and re-ceiving stolen property.
Assistant Commonwealth’s 
Attorney David Dalton said first-time theft charges often won’t re-sult in jail time.
But he added in a news re-
lease, “These are tough times, and parents shouldn’t have to explain to children why someone would steal ‘baby Jesus’ out of a Nativity scene or rip decorations from the side of the house. It was a stupid stunt and deserved some jail time.”

at the festival with a small 
memorabilia museum, a raffle 
for a Diddley signature guitar 
and rock, rap, pop and gospel performances by family mem-bers.
The rock ‘n’ roll world left 
Diddley wanting more, said Evelyn Kelly, Diddley’s daugh-ter.
“He was always an adven-
turous type, he always wanted his own community, a place where all his family could come and stay and be together,” she said. “His old manager men-tioned Archer, and he came here and looked for some land and decided he would live here.”
When Diddley died, fam-
ily members created the Bo Diddley Foundation Inc. in his honor, which donates money to local causes, including home-lessness. One of the founda-tion’s projects has been the creation of the memorabilia museum, which will debut at 
the festival on Saturday.
“Since the museum is small, 
it is not going to be a huge 
display, but the best items of Diddley’s past will be dis-played,” said Faith Fusillo, Diddley’s co-manager and board member of the founda-tion. The exhibit will include 
Diddley’s stage guitar, gold re-
cords, stage costumes and pic-tures with famous friends like Eric Clapton and Bruce Spring-steen. Admission will be $2.
Plans for the museum to go 
on tour are being discussed, Kelly said. 
Also, a signature Bo Diddley 
red-square Gretsch guitar will be raffled off on Saturday. Tick-ets will be sold at the Archer post office for $1 apiece. 
All revenue from the mu-
seum and the raffle will go to the foundation, Fusillo said in a phone interview. The founda-tion is unsure of which chari-
ties will receive money, but all 
donations will be given within Archer, she said.
The choice to keep contribu-
tions local carries on the spirit of Diddley’s charity, according to Fusillo.
“Small towns are having fi-
nancial difficulties during these 
rough economic times,” she 
said. “If Bo was still here, he would be helping.” 
Phil Denton, president of the 
Archer Historical Society, be-lieves that recognizing Diddley will bring more people to the festival than in previous years.
“We are getting a more early 
excitement this year than past years and a higher level of in-terest,” said Denton, citing 5,000 visitors to last year’s fes-tival. “Overall I think it will be the biggest Yulee Day we have had in 15 years.” WHAT’S HAPPENINg?

Marijuana grow room discovered
A fire in an Ocala house re-
sulted in the discovery of a 
grow room that contained more 
than 40 marijuana plants.
At about 4:45 a.m. agents 
from the Unified Drug Enforce-
ment Strike Team were called to 
the fire at 2004 SW 38th Court 
believing it contained a meth-amphetamine lab.
When they arrived, the 
agents found that almost half of 
the house was sectioned off to 
grow marijuana, a High Inten-sity Drug Trafficking Area Pro-gram release stated.
After finding 31 charred mar-
ijuana plants and other growing equipment in the debris, agents believe the fire was started in the grow room.
According to the release, 
footprints were found near the back of the grow room and led to the backyard where 13 intact 
marijuana plants were found.
The renter, Julian Vinas, said 
he didn’t know about the grow 
room and that a man named Miguel was responsible for the 
marijuana plants and the fire.
Vinas, 48, said Miguel paid 
him $350 a month to live in the 
house with Vinas’ wife, their 
three kids and the family dog, 
the release stated.
Although the family was 
sleeping when the fire started at 1 a.m., they made it out of the 
house safely.
Vinas was arrested and 
charged with arson, cultivation 
of marijuana, possession of a 
firearm while committing a fel-
ony and child endangerment.

gville celebrates rock legends
A year after his death, Bo 
Diddley is still giving back to 
the Florida community where he spent the last years of his life.
On Saturday, the City of Ar-
cher will hold its Yulee Diddley Day, in honor of its two most famous citizens: rock legend Bo Diddley and railroad pioneer Da-vid Levy Yulee. 
Celebrating Diddley is a new 
addition to the festival, following his death about a year ago. 
Festival organizers had hoped 
last year that Diddley would join the Yulee Day parade, but the musician suffered a fatal stroke and his funeral was held on the same day as the festival.NEWSROOM

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — New Hamp-
shire became the sixth state to legalize 
gay marriage Wednesday in a move that 
reflects the state’s changing demograph-ics from reliably Republican and conser-
vative to younger and more liberal.
The Senate and House passed key 
language on religious rights; Gov. John Lynch — who personally opposes 
gay marriage — signed the legislation Wednesday afternoon.
Lynch, a Democrat, had promised a 
veto if the law didn’t clearly spell out that churches and religious groups would not 
be forced to officiate at gay marriages or 
provide other services. Legislators made the changes.
“Today, we are standing up for the 
liberties of same-sex couples by making clear that they will receive the same rights, 
responsibilities — and respect — under 
New Hampshire law,” Lynch said.
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, 
Vermont and Iowa already allow gay marriage, though opponents hope to overturn Maine’s law with a public vote.
California briefly allowed gay mar-
riage before a public vote banned it; a court ruling grandfathered in couples 
who were already married.
Lynch said it is now time for the feder-
al government to extend full equal rights to same-sex couples.After rallies outside the Statehouse 
by both sides in the morning, the last of 
three bills in the package went to the Sen-ate, which approved it 14-10 Wednesday 
afternoon.
Cheers from the gallery greeted the 
key vote in the House, which passed it 198-176. Surrounded by gay marriage 
supporters, Lynch signed the bill about an hour later.
The New Hampshire law will take ef-
fect Jan. 1, exactly two years after the state 
began recognizing civil unions.
The Rt. Rev. V. Gene Robinson, elect-
ed in New Hampshire in 2003 as the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal 
Church, was among those celebrating the new law.
“It’s about being recognized as whole 
people and whole citizens,” Robinson said.
“There are a lot of people standing 
here who when we grew up could not have imagined this,” he said. “You can’t 
imagine something that is simply impos-
sible. It’s happened, in our lifetimes.”NATIONALNew Hampshire passes

Some UF students could see tuition in-
crease by almost 16 percent beginning in 
the fall, and most of that increase wouldn’t be covered by Bright Futures.
The bulk of the increase stems from a 
new law allowing all 11 state universities to raise tuition by up to 15 percent until they reach the national average.
The state approved an 8 percent tuition 
hike for all state universities next year, and UF has asked its Board of Trustees, the university’s highest governing body, to approve an increase of another 7 percent in order to reach the 15 percent limit. They 
will vote on the proposal June 12. 
The 7 percent increase would apply 
only to students who enrolled in the fall of 
2007 or later, which means in-state under-graduates who fall in this category would pay $145.76 per credit hour, or about $20 more than before.
The remaining portions of the increase 
come from a collection of fee increases as 
well as a new technology fee.
Student Body President Jordan Johnson 
said he’s in favor of the tuition increase be-
cause it will help UF without placing an undue burden on students.
“This is going to be our way of pushing 
through these tough times,” Johnson said.
Johnson said he thinks it’s about time 
UF was allowed to increase its tuition to 
the national average, which was $6,585 at public universities this year, according to 
the College Board. At UF, in-state under-graduates taking 30 credits pay $3,777 a 
year now and would pay about $4,373 next 
year if the changes pass.
“It’s amazing we’ve come this far with 
where our tuition is at,” Johnson said.
He said he’s also in favor of the new 
technology fee, which could include ex-panding free printing beyond the third floor of the Reitz Union and creating a cen-tral database where students can store their 
information, allowing students to access 
their personal documents from any com-
puter on campus.
Johnson said 
a new committee will be created in 
Summer B to determine exactly how the money, $4.42 per credit hour for under-graduates, will be spent.
“I’m pumped,” he said at the Board of 
Trustees committee meeting Wednesday.
Trustees were also briefed on the com-
position of UF’s incoming freshman class. For the first time ever, 60 percent of the admitted applicants are female. Women at UF also tend to have higher graduation rates and graduate sooner than men, said UF Provost Joe Glover.
Trustees were told that UF has accepted 
about 2,600 transfer students for next year, which is about 600 more than last year, de-spite UF reducing the number of transfer students it accepted this year. UF is also in the process of cutting enrollment by 4,000 over a four-year period.UF requests tuition hike

Officials try to
move sexoffender camp
By HILARY LEHMAN
Associated Press Writer
MIAMI — Local officials have accused the state of giv-
ing up efforts to relocate 70 sex offenders who live under a 
busy bridge over Biscayne Bay that connects Miami to Mi-
ami Beach.
In a letter sent to Gov. Charlie Crist, Miami City Manager 
Pete Hernandez said the state should move the offenders who have been living under the Julia Tuttle Causeway be-
cause the city considers a nearby island a park.
“It appears that the Department of Cor-
rections has simply given up on its quest to find adequate housing for these offend-ers and has decided that it is appropriate to 
cast them under the causeway,” Hernan-
dez wrote in the Monday letter.
The sex offenders are living under the 
causeway in a colony that started in 2007. 
The offenders have been cornered into the 
the area by local residency requirements 
that prohibit them from living anywhere within 2,500 feet of 
anywhere children congregate, such as schools or parks.
Not long after the colony started, the state has said it 
would ask the sex offenders to leave, but the camp has con-tinued growing.
On Tuesday, Crist said he’s not sure the offenders should 
be relocated.
“The concern I have is I don’t know these people are tres-
passing,” Crist said, adding that he thought they were liv-ing under the bridge in an attempt to honor the residency requirements.

Charges will not be filed against Ser-
gio Castro, 22, the UF student arrested 
last week for spray-painting a memo-rial to a drowned Gainesville resident on The Top restaurant in downtown 
Gainesville.
Prosecutors who reviewed the case 
chose not to file charges because it wasn’t 
a typical case of graffiti vandalism and because the owners of The Top wanted the felony charge of criminal mischief dropped, said Spencer Mann, spokes-man for the State Attorney’s office.
Castro was arrested after a Gainesville 
Police Department officer noticed him trying to spray-paint the words “RIP MUCH LOVE” in honor of Barry Ber-nard, the Gainesville resident whose body was found last month near the Ma-tanzas Inlet in St. Johns County.
“This is someone who was distraught 
over the loss of a friend who wanted to put a memorial up,” Mann said. “Not to 
excuse it, but it helps us to better under-
stand his motivation.”
Castro said he is relieved that the 
charges have been dropped and thanked the owners of The Top for their lenien-cy. 
Overall, he said the situation has been 
a positive one. 
“The whole purpose behind me go-
ing out and doing this was to bring at-tention to the cause,” he said. 
There will be events to benefit the 
family at Sharab Lounge in downtown Gainesville tonight and Friday night, and the funeral will be Sunday morning 
at the Thomas Center, he said.LOCALCharges dropped for local artist

When he came to Gainesville to play for 
the UF baseball team, Brandon McArthur did 
not plan to stay for six years.
After a random act of violence severely in-
jured him in his first year, the 24-year-old had 
to take a different approach to his life that not 
only led to his becoming a leader on the field but to his emergence as a contributor to the community.
McArthur said he doesn’t remember any-
thing from the night he was attacked and has to rely on the accounts of those who were with him. 
On the night of Oct. 30, 2003, he was 
punched in the head and knocked uncon-scious near the intersection of West Univer-sity Avenue and Northwest 17th Street.
The impact of his head hitting the ground 
caused brain swelling and bleeding in his skull, leaving him in a coma, McArthur said.
“They weren’t sure whether he was go-
ing to live, let alone play,“ said John Hines, sports information director for the UF base-
ball team.
Brandon’s sister, Amy McArthur, 27, said 
she was shocked when she heard the news.
“Seeing him laying in the hospital bed was 
just unreal,” she said.
The injury changed his perspective on life, 
and McArthur said he established a close re-
lationship with God.
“Once my injury came, that humbled me, 
and made me realize that life can be taken away from you at any point in time,” he said. “I’ve cherished so many things so much bet-ter now, that I think it’s definitely made me a better person to live day by day.”
After his recovery, McArthur began vol-
unteering in the Gainesville community by speaking at Fellowship of Christian Athletes meetings, joining the Student-Athlete Com-mittee and the Big Brothers Big Sisters orga-nization.
He also started volunteering at Shands 
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, where he spent two weeks as a patient.
The ICU visits are emotionally intense, as 
he visits with families and patients in similar positions to his own experience.
“I don’t ever remember seeing myself in 
that state… but when I see people… who can’t interact with you, I was in a coma for a week…that really gets to me, because I can’t imagine my family like that, trying to interact with me and not being able to speak to me or have me speak back to them,” he said.
McArthur once visited with the family of 
a baseball player who had suffered severe in-juries in an auto accident and was a patient at Shands.
“I met with his family the entire time that 
he was in the hospital, just tried to give them inspiration, give them hope that their son can 
make it through just like I did,” he said.
Now that he has seen what a patient’s 
family goes through, McArthur said he helps 
them stay positive.
“Any time I get the opportunity to go in 
there and see people or families that are in shambles, I try to lift their spirits up and let them believe that their siblings or their sons or daughters can overcome it,” he said.
He said his family, in particular his mother 
Valerie and his sister Amy are proud of his volunteering.“It really helps people who are going 
through similar situations to see him and how he’s overcome all his obstacles,” Amy said. “I’m very proud of what he’s doing with his life.”
The most rewarding part of his volunteer-
ing is the knowledge that he has helped a pa-tient or family on the road to recovery.
“If I can just get one person, just get in one 
person’s head and get them to buy into the correct way to go about their stay and believe that they can overcome any obstacle in their lives, if I can just touch that one person I think that I’ve succeeded that day,” McArthur said.
He tries to help his younger baseball team-
mates become active in community service, despite not having the same experiences he does.
“I want them to know that they can do it 
just like I can do it in their own way because they face [their own] obstacles,” he said.McArthur continued to battle injuries after 
missing the 2004 season. He missed the entire 2007 season due to a torn ulnar collateral liga-ment in his right elbow and played part of the 2008 season with a torn anterior cruciate liga-ment.
He still hopes to play professionally, but 
McArthur realizes his injuries and age might prevent that.
“Brandon is a realist,” Hines said. “When 
your body takes that much punishment…sooner or later, it might not keep coming back.” 
Coaching or law enforcement are possi-
bilities he’s exploring, the criminology major said.
Hines said he can see McArthur having a 
career in coaching.
“Baseball is in his blood,” he said.If McArthur cannot play professional base-
ball, Hines is confident that he will succeed in whatever he does.
“If Brandon never steps on the baseball 
field again, he has more than enough going for him to make a life for himself,” he said.
McArthur was named a finalist for the 
Lowe’s Senior CLASS award, an award given 
to the senior athlete in each college sport dem-
onstrating a commitment to his or her school and achievements in the fields of “Character, Classroom, Community and Competition.” 
The winner will be announced at the Col-
lege World Series in Omaha, Neb., on June 19.
With UF hosting a NCAA Super Regional 
this weekend, McArthur will play his final 
Gators home game. 
McArthur’s sister plans to come to 
Gainesville to watch him play in his final 
home series and is excited that he may have a chance to go back to Omaha, she said.
McArthur is hopeful that the Gators can

With King James left watching from his medical bed 
and Superman laughing all the way to the STAPLES Center, the Department of Darts & Laurels offers 
Gainesville’s faux Orlando Magic fans a hearty congratulations on reaching the NBA Finals.
Hell, who would have “thunk” a team constructed around 
a SpongeBob SquarePants-loving 23-year-old and coached by a Men’s Wearhouse-rocking hedgehog could reach the summit of the esteemed Eastern Conference? 
Before we head to Gainesville’s finest drinking establish-
ment, otherwise known as Gator City (our sincerest apologies go out to Munigan’s) for Game 1 of the Finals, the Department of Darts & Laurels proudly presents this week’s J.J.-Redick’s-back-should-be-the-next-Proactiv-spokesman edition of... 
Darts & Laurels
While the state of Tennessee has been known to house a 
world of oddities (Lane Kiffin, anyone?), the latest resident to make headlines surprisingly does not hail from Knoxville. For wearing nothing more than a thong while robbing a house, the Department of Darts & Laurels tosses a leave-the-panties-to-
the-ladies DART at the whale-tailed wonder. We do not harbor 
any ill-will against revealing underwear and neither does Tim 
Tebow (check out the article on Page 10), but something tells us a mask and black clothing works better as criminal attire. 
With countless dogs making headlines for all the wrong rea-
sons, one canine stands out from all the rest for doing a good deed. The Department of Darts & Laurels awards a you-should-hire-Scott-Boras-as-your-agent-when-Hollywood-starts-calling LAUREL to Blewett the black Labrador retriever for rescuing 
Pepper, an old arthritic dog who had gone missing. Blewett knows a thing or two about being saved by the good graces of others as he relied on food from travelers when he found him-self homeless during a rough patch last March.
No word on whether the star of “Air Bud” is willing to un-
dergo a dye job for the movie.
When a Pittsburgh Pirates’ minor league baseball team de-
cided to work President Barack Obama into a fan giveaway, little did they realize the federal government would come into 
play. For confiscating more than 1,000 bobbleheads featuring 
the president in his high school basketball uniform, the Depart-ment of Darts & Laurels chucks a maybe-the-higher-ups-vot-ed-for-the-other-guy DART at the U.S. Customs based in Los 
Angeles. Maybe we’ve watched the movie “Traffic” a few too many times, but we suggest they boil down the bobbleheads to see if the West Virginia Power were actually smuggling coke.
Word out of Nebraska reveals news of a 6-year-old boy 
channeling his inner Jeff Gordon. The Department of Darts 
& Laurels presents a you-should-totally-be-given-a-driver’s-
license-for-your-efforts LAUREL to Tustin Mains for having 
the wherewithal to drive the family truck to safety after his dad passed out from a low blood sugar level. Score an assist to a police officer who helped stop the vehicle, but praise is in order any time a kindergartner can handle a Chevy Avalanche with-out causing little more than minor damage.
The year 2009 has not been kind to peacocks living in Maka-
ha, Hawaii, as a heinous trifecta of poison, bullets and baseball 
bats has claimed the lives of 11 of their brethren. For using her 
Louisville Slugger to put “Pauly” in an early grave, the Depart-ment of Darts & Laurels launches an at-least-you-weren’t-the-one-to-use-the-gun DART at Sandra Maloney. Maybe Ma-
loney is more of a cat person, but using her wood at the local batting cage would’ve been a much better idea. 
Sure riding roller coasters has been a summer vacation staple 
ever since Coney Island’s heyday, but now you can experience Six Gs of fun all while collecting a paycheck. The Department of Darts & Laurels extends an if-we-win-we’re-quitting-our-day-
jobs LAUREL to the Orlando/Orange County Convention & 
Visitors Bureau for sponsoring a contest where the winner gets 
a fat 25k to ride roller coasters this fall. Don’t bother applying unless you’ve got a kickin’ smile and a willingness to spend 67 days in Orlando (yuck).

No way to rationalize political ignorance
Today’s question: Do you consider 
yourself politically ignorant?54% YES46% NO
185 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Do you think the First Couple’s date was too extravagant?
Recently, I read a letter to the editor of my hometown 
newspaper. The author had worked himself into a tizzy over President Barack Obama and the entire 
democratic leadership in Washington and their push for universal health care. He declared that any attempt at a universal health care system was an attempt at socialism and should be protested with equal zeal as one would pro-
test Stalin’s Red Army coming down the road.
Never mind that the United States is the only industri-
alized nation not to have universal health care, or that the 
U.S. spends more than double per capita on health care than the average European country and still has a lower 
average life expectancy, or that the Obama administration 
has not pushed a single-payer system. Rather, such a sys-tem would work with existing insurers and give Ameri-cans the ability to opt out of the system if they so chose 
— none of this mattered. The author rationally decided to 
ignore these facts.
There’s a lot of rationalized ignorance going around 
these days. I’m pretty sure the zenith was hit when can-didate Obama was labeled a socialist. No one seems ca-
pable anymore to engage in meaningful debate; instead 
we take to the airwaves and to the newspapers and throw out senseless labels. He’s a socialist; the Hon. Sonia Soto-mayor is a reverse racist. None of this child’s play actually 
accomplishes anything, but let us resort back to our origi-
nal intuitions and narrow thinking.
It would be incorrect to assume that liberals are any 
less rationally ignorant than your average Rush Limbaugh listener and Ann Coulter reader. Nor should I try to hold 
myself up as a person who believes himself as any less 
ignorant than others. Ask me to explain how the differ-ences between the Punjabis and the Pashtun ethnic groups in Pakistan contribute to the conflict between India and Pakistan, and all you’ll get is a shrug.
There are at least 10 people who 
will read this column and arrogant-ly decide that they’re quite fine ra-tionalizing their ignorance. Perhaps 
they don’t have the time to read 
every notable economist’s opinion 
about the stimulus bill and don’t care whether former President Ronald Reagan is truly to blame for our financial crisis when he signed the Garn-St. Germain Depository In-
stitutions Act in 1982, as Nobel Prize winning economist 
Paul Krugman observed in The New York Times yester-day. That’s fine. Who does have the time?
Others, though, will continue to rationalize their igno-
rance because they share a certain pride in their lack of logic. Politicians haven’t helped this bizarre reasoning, deriding their constituents as “folks” and “average Joes.” Education, one would think, would be the key in turning back the tidal wave of misinformation perpetuated by 
rationalized ignorance, but according to the National En-
dowment for the Arts, the percentage of 17-year-olds who read one book per year outside of the classroom was cut in half from 1984 to 2004.
If there is one goal that any university or college should 
strive for, I hope it’s a goal that gives its students no excuse to rationalize their ignorance. I hope that it’s an education that teaches the next generation of America that we can no longer afford to partake in factless and fallacious debates. 
And if all else fails, Newt Gingrich is a jerk.

GOP efforts to 
block Sotomayorreflect tired politicsGuest column
Neil W. Blackmon
Speaking Out
Politicians and the business press 
are looking for signs that the eco-nomic crisis is over, and we’ll soon 
be back on track. Federal Reserve Chair-man Ben Bernanke speaks of “green shoots” of recovery. President Barack Obama sees “glimmers of hope.” 
All the massive infusions of bor-
rowed stimulus and bailout money are aimed at the dream of getting us back to where we were during the recent “boom.” Do we really want to go there? And even if we do, is such an economy realistic today?
Yes, the bubble economy of 2000 
created mountains of paper wealth. Be-tween tax cuts for the wealthiest and increasingly exotic (and risky) forms of investment, the richest fraction of Amer-icans did very well indeed.
But during that boom incomes stayed 
flat for the overwhelming majority of Americans even as productivity soared, millions lost health care coverage; costs of energy, housing, food and education climbed and debt reached record levels.
If economic recovery means return-
ing to those times, there’s no reason for most of us to want it. This economic cri-sis may be the best opportunity in our lifetimes to shut down the unfair and de-structive Wall Street system and reboot with a values-based operating system for a new economy designed to support social and environmental balance and the businesses that create sustainable and fair prosperity. 
We have seen what happens when 
government and big business operate in secret. 
The new system must be open to 
public scrutiny. It must be locally root-ed in strong communities, distribute wealth equitably and balance public and private interests. Society is better served by a system that favors productive work and investment, 
limits speculation and suppresses infla-tion in all forms — including financial bubbles.
Here’s how we can get there:1. Responsible Enterprise. Service 
to the community, rather than profit, is the primary justification for a business to exist. Enterprises are most likely to serve their communities when they are human-scale and owned by responsible local investors with an active interest in their operation beyond mere profit. No corporation should be too big to fail. The new economy will use antitrust to break up large corporations into their compo-nent parts and sell them to responsible local owners, including family, worker and community-owned enterprises and cooperative alliances among locally rooted firms.
2. Community Banking. The gov-
ernment is buying ownership shares in failed Wall Street banks with the ex-pectation of eventually reselling them to private interests. A better plan, as many economists are recommending, is to force bankrupt banks into govern-ment receivership. These banks should be broken up and their branches sold to local investors. These community banks, credit unions and mutual savings and loan associations should be chartered to serve Main Street needs, lending to local manufacturers, merchants, farmers and homeowners within a strong regulatory framework.
3. Real Wealth Investment. Contrary 
to the claims of Wall Street, financial speculation does not create real wealth. Because it serves no public interest, is predatory and causes instability, it should be strongly discouraged. The money that has been used for specula-tion must be redirected to productive in-vestment that meets our essential needs responsibly, equitably and sustainably, using green technologies and closed-loop production cycles.
4. Middle-Class Fiscal Policy. It is time 
to reinstitute the policies that created the American middle class after World War II. Restore progressive income tax with a top rate of 91 percent as under the Republican Eisenhower administra-tion; favor universal participation in re-sponsible home ownership and a family wage. Because no one has a natural birth entitlement to any greater share of the real wealth of society than anyone else, use the estate tax to help restore social balance at the end of each lifetime.
5. Government-Issued Money. The 
government can and should issue debt-free money to create living wage jobs, rebuild public infrastructure and restore domestic productive capacity. Properly administered, this money will flow to community-based enterprises and help revitalize Main Street market economies engaged in the production of real wealth. It is folly, however, for government to fi-nance those projects by borrowing mon-ey created by the same private banks that created the financial mess.
Current proposals for dealing with 
the economic collapse fall far short of a real solution to the current economic crisis. 
We face an urgent need to expand and 
deepen the debate to advance options that can build sustainable prosperity for all our children and grandchildren.

Speaking Out
Perhaps you’ve been too immersed in one more 
summer of undergraduate bliss before facing that life-defining LSAT or MCAT this fall. Or perhaps 
you’ve been debating the merits of Kobe Bryant’s legacy if he fails to win a title without Shaq, or why all Holly-wood seems to do now is remake old films instead of write new ones, to notice. If so, you are missing a show far more embarrassing than Kris Allen winning American Idol. This show is the hapless efforts of conservative ac-tivists to paint President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor as a liberal ideologue unfit for service. With figures such as Rush Limbaugh admitting the chances of stopping her nomination are minimal, the question must be asked: Why the rabid opposition in the first place? 
In a somewhat tragic historical twist of fate, Sotomay-
or, a Latina woman who grew up in the ethnically rich South Bronx and now sits on a federal bench dominated by white, ruling class males, is being cast by conserva-tives not as the discriminated but the discriminator. To 
bolster this claim, conserva-tives are pointing to her ap-pellate court ruling against firefighter Frank Ricci, a dys-
lexic white male who in 2003 aced a lieutenant’s pro-
motion test given by the city but was denied promotion 
when all 19 black applicants who took the test failed. A Supreme Court ruling on this case, likely in Ricci’s favor, should come this month. Nonetheless, conservatives are 
using it to say Sotomayor is guilty of “reverse racism.” 
One can’t help but sense the Shakespearian-level irony 
in this assault on Sotomayor. Not only do the claims she 
is racist reek of politics   — a thinly veiled, desperate ploy 
to reconnect with blue-collar voters, who may not be lis-tening anyway and who trended Obama in the previous election; it more disturbingly continues the trend of con-servative historical amnesia. After nominating their pal Harriet Miers to the high tribunal failed, Rovian Republi-cans applauded their nominee Samuel Alito’s “empathy” and regard for lived experience when he said his own Italian-American heritage and their history of discrimi-nation influenced his perspective in cases on discrimina-tion. It is perplexing and sad that suddenly Sotomayor’s admitted influences from her own background warrant a flogging while Alito’s merit conservative applause.  
Alternatively, conservative legal theorists have la-
beled Sotomayor an activist whose decisions are “results-oriented” and too focused on outcomes rather than the law. The truth is that in 15 years on the federal bench (more than either of President George W. Bush’s nomi-nees), Sotomayor does not appear to have a compelling attachment to any particular judicial theory.  
The “I forgot” moment in this assault is that one of the 
conservative judicial movement’s favorite sons, the late chief justice of the United States Justice William Rehn-quist, was perhaps the most result-oriented justice in the history of the court. He never consistently adhered to any theory, instead using the “original intent” theory or other legal theories whenever it was most convenient to achieve a desired result. In many respects, the careful, fact-based reasoning innate to Sotomayor’s opinions resemble more a conservative “ideas have consequences” approach, or the approach of her moderate predecessor, Justice David Souter, than they do any liberal legal theory.  
If her confirmation is the endgame, then the net ben-
efit of rabid opposition must outweigh the end result to serve a purpose. Here it does not. It is merely political grandstanding that can only further the chasm between the base of the Republican Party and the pulse of the country, and for conservatives, it creates the greater risk that Obama will take a “damn the torpedoes” approach to his next nominee, appointing not a moderate like Soto-mayor but rather a judge who actually fits the bill of “lib-eral ideologue” or “judicial activist,” leaving conserva-tives with little or no political capital to get in the way.

� SMART PEOPLE HAVE THE 
MOST ECONOMIC SUCCESS.
By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
It turns out those Jimmy Choos 
can’t be considered an investment.
A recent UF study shows intel-
ligent people have more economic 
success over a lifetime than those 
who are attractive or self-confident.
“If you were somehow able to 
choose from being smart, good-
looking or self-confident, our study shows that while you’d want all three qualities, brains are the most important to economic success,” said Timothy Judge, the UF management professor who conducted the study along with graduate students Char-
lice Hurst and Lauren Simon.
“Smart people do better in their 
careers because they are more likely 
to be educated and are more confi-dent in their abilities,” Judge said. 
Results of the study came from 
191 men and women, ages 25 to 75, who participated in the National Midlife Development in the United 
States study.“You could be the most beauti-
ful teacher, but if you don’t have 
classroom management skills, then students aren’t going to care,” said 
Nadene Francis, assistant director 
of public relations 
for the UF Career 
Resource Center.
Intelligence standards for the 
study were based on mental exer-cises and tests, and self-confidence, which was the second-most impor-tant, was measured by a 15-question survey about a person’s ability to 
handle life situations.Attractiveness was judged on 
personal photos on a one to seven 
scale. Although it placed last against intelligence and self-confidence, beauty’s importance in the job in-dustry is still troubling, Judge said. 
According to Judge, studies show 
that attractive students tend to re-ceive more instruction and attention from teachers and are punished less frequently, increasing their chances of finishing high school and college.
“Beauty is key because society is 
based on looks,” said The Swamp Restaurant manager Erika Equizi of 
beauty and intelligence when work-ing in the food industry. “Pretty girls 
get more (tips).”
The results of the study, which 
were published in the Journal of Applied Psychology, emphasize the need for employers to be fair when 
hiring, Judge said. However, some 
employers value neither intelligence nor physical attraction as much as personality and job skill.
“(Beauty’s) not going to do you 
any good,” said Lynne Vaughan, Reitz Union store director, of work-ing in retail. “(Intelligence) won’t do you any good either if you don’t 
have the personality.”

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — 
San Quentin State Prison. Los Ange-
les Memorial Coliseum. The Califor-nia State Fairgrounds.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 
plan to put some of his state’s big-gest landmarks up for sale to help erase a $24 billion budget deficit is fraught with questions, chief among them: How can California taxpay-ers possibly get a good deal in this slumping real estate market?
Schwarzenegger, who has also 
proposed deep cuts in education, health care, welfare and parks, wants to sell off some property out-right, sell office buildings and then rent them back from the new land-lords, and lease some state land to developers.
“Everywhere I go, I hear sto-
ries about families selling off their boats and motorcycles to make ends meet. They have garage sales and yard sales,” he told the Legislature this week, offering his rationale for selling assets. “They know that you don’t have or keep a boat at the dock when you can’t put food on the ta-ble.”
The governor said California 
could generate $3 billion from sell-ing seven landmarks and 11 of-fice buildings scattered around the 
state.
In most cases, 
however, it would take a few years to complete the sales, doing nothing for California’s im-mediate budget 
crisis. Moreover, 
selling in the middle of a recession and a downturn in real estate is a questionable proposition.
“Fundamentally, this is the 
wrong time to do this,” said Robert Griswold, a real estate author and member of the planning commission in San Diego. “The market is down and is now in the favor of people looking to buy these properties and not in the favor of the state.”10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 4, 2009
charge, a bill can include a stor-
age fee, a lien fee and adminis-tration fees and taxes.
Booting incurs no additional 
fees, he said 
“In the beginning no one 
wants [to be booted or towed],” Witesides said. “But when they think about not having to get a ride to the towing company to get their car, and it saves them time and money, they always agree booting is the better op-tion.”
When a car is booted, contact 
information for Parking Solu-tions is left on the windshield. Company employees respond within 10 to 15 minutes to re-move the boot, Witesides said.
“We try to be fair as much as 
possible,” he said. “If someone is illegally parked, and they come back in a few minutes, we will try to give them a break.” 
Mike Cook, manager of I Love 
N.Y. Pizza, feels that booting will do a better job of getting across the message, he said. 
“It does suck when people 
leave their cars and they go to school or the go to Swamp res-taurant,” he said. 
However, some business peo-
ple in the area see downsides to the policy.
Geyzer Salgado, manager 
of Fritanga Latin Grill, opposes booting.
He feels that Parking Solu-
tions is taking business away from him when there are booted cars in the lot versus removing the illegally parked cars in front of his business, he said. 
Parking Solutions doesn’t no-tify people when they are illegal-ly parked. The car can sit there for 2 to 4 hours and possibly turn away customers, Salgado said. 
Filup Molina, manager of 
How I Got An A, said he thinks that people just don’t know what businesses go to what parking lot, and people think they can park here to go to any midtown business.
“It’s a bad way to treat cus-
tomers who do want to come to our business,” he said “It’s the classic power trip situation.”
Ultimately, Witesides feels 
that he is doing college students a favor, he said.
“Everywhere is a parking 
problem, towing is needed, if you can get away with a cheaper deterrent then why not help the kids out a little bit,” Witesides said.
Some oppose booting because of space
According to Combs the 
only five acceptable reasons to 
appeal a parking citation are:
l A malfunctioning meter
l A valid or verifiable emer-
gency
l If he or she is a govern-
ment employee or official on official business, which allows them to violate the time limit, park in unauthorized parking, 
etc.
l If he or she is a city volun-
teer who was detained because 
of their duties
l If there was an error in the 
issuance of the citationAlthough a majority of 
people reply within the time 
limits, said Combs, the City 
decided to rid people of a “dis-advantage” they might have by excluding weekends and holidays.
Some people’s reasons for 
appealing a parking ticket in-clude “there was no sign post-ed at my parking spot” and 
“the meter wasn’t working.”
“I had to turn a paper in to 
the professor by 12 and had 
no place else to park” is not an acceptable reason to appeal a parking citation, Combs said.Flawed meters, emergencies 
are valid excuses for appealBy JESSICA CHAPMAN

Women whose TV screens come 
between them and UF’s star quarter-
back now have one way to get closer to the action — Tim Tebow thongs.
TeeBow’s, fashioned with the 
Heisman Trophy winner in mind, come in three styles, including a thong with the number 15 written 
on a football. 
“We thought it would be a cute 
idea,” said Samantha Smith,  a UF 
senior and creator of TeeBow’s.“It’s not meant to offend anyone or get 
Tim Tebow upset.” 
Before starting TeeBows.com in 
December, Smith, 21, along with  
family and friends, sold the under-wear on West University Avenue before football games during the 2008 season.
She said she came up with the 
idea for TeeBow’s when one of her 
friends noticed her thong was hang-
ing out. 
When Smith made a joke about 
her “t-bow,” referring to the bow on her thong, she thought Tebow-trib-uted underwear might be popular among adoring fans.
The Web site ran into copyright 
infringement trouble in April when the Collegiate Licensing Company, which partners with UF, sent Web 
site creator Kris Bates a cease-and-
desist letter for the Web site’s photo of Tebow. Due to NCAA licens-ing laws, Tebow’s photo cannot be printed or sold.
Bates received an additional let-
ter from UF asking him to remove the official UF logo to keep from violating copyright laws.
Following the publicity from 
the cease-and-desist letters and an advertisement on digg.com,  the Web site went from six visits a day to about 23,000 daily visits. The $6 thongs are only available for pur-
chase on TeeBows.com, Bates said.
Because Bates doesn’t think Tee-
Bow’s will be as popular after the 
quarterback graduates, he said they will most likely not continue to sell them.
“If the Tebow family called and 
asked us to stop selling them, we would probably take it down,” Bates 
said. “The truth is, based on what I 
know about Tim, he’s probably get-ting a chuckle out of this. If he is the guy we all think he is, he’s taking it with a grain of salt.”

■ MICHAEL PATRONE AND MICHAEL 
BREVDA WERE BOTH APPROVED.
By SARA WA tSoN
Alligator Writer
In the shortest Student Government Sen-
ate meeting of the summer so far, Senators 
approved judiciary appointments and passed resolutions before 9 p.m.
“My bedtime is 10 p.m., so I’d like to fin-
ish early,” Parliamentarian Taylor Siegel said at the beginning of Tuesday’s meeting in an effort to study and rest before his and Sen-ate President Audrey Goldman’s upcoming LSATs. 
The meeting quickly progressed to the Su-
preme Court appointments of Michael Patro-ne and Michael Brevda, who were nominated by SG President Jordan Johnson. 
Sen. Ashton Charles, the judiciary chair 
who reviewed the nominations, said that both Patrone and Brevda demonstrated their abili-ties to act in a nonpartisan manner.
Patrone was present at the meeting and an-
swered questions from various senators.
“My own personal beliefs need to be irrele-
vant when I’m in the court evaluating issues,” Patrone said. 
Job commitments in Orlando prevented 
Brevda from attending Tuesday’s meeting, but he answered questions through a phone interview on speakerphone so all senators could hear. 
Brevda highlighted his past work for Re-
publican Congressman Ric Keller to demon-strate his nonpartisanship. Despite Brevda’s Democratic affiliation, he worked for Keller and said he was asked to continue working full time. 
The Senate approved both Patrone and 
Brevda.
In a press release, Sen. Nick Mildebrath of 
the Progress Party noted that Brevda was ap-proved unanimously, “a rarity for any court nominee at UF.” 
Though Patrone’s approval was not unani-
mous, Mildebrath said the Progress Party was “extremely heartened to see that both parties 
allowed a free, open and civil debate.” 
Tuesday’s meeting also marked the pass-
ing of two resolutions. The first congratu-
lated Florida Alternative 
Breaks, an organization that focuses on social is-sues like HIV/AIDS and animal refuge through 
student trips, for being named the National 
Alternative Break Program for 2009. 
The second resolution honored UF students 
who died last semester. Copies of the resolu-
tion will be sent to families of lost students, Charles said.
Johnson was not present, but Press Secre-
tary Eric Conrad attended on his behalf. 
Conrad said Johnson is trying to attain 
parking spaces for students in the Southwest 
Parking Garage Complex, slated for comple-
tion in September.
“We’re hopeful, but we’re not completely 
sure because of how distant this garage is how many spots we’re actually going to get,” Con-rad said.

With all the rabble between scientists and 
media outlets over the benefits and dangers 
of coffee, it’s hard to know what to believe. People on the left  say it prevents cancer, and other people on the left say it could give you a heart attack. People on the right talk too, but 
I don’t listen to them. Like any red-blooded, 
coffee loving fool, I decided to see for myself.
2:45 pm:  According to naturalnews.
com, too much caffeine can lead to “chronic adrenal failure.” I decide it’s better to stop reading.
3:05 pm: The pure and unadulterated 
joy that is Dunkin’ Donuts coffee — four creams and two sugars.
3:06 pm: A man in cowboy boots 
and mullet asks who sings “Hot Child in the 
City.” Steely Dan?
3:23 pm: “Celebration” comes on the gas 
station speakers. I dance, then a short walk to Borders around the corner. Hands a little shaky.  
    3:30 pm: Borders was made for coffee lovers. Cute barista with short hair offers “Vi-enna Roast.” Atmosphere: inviting. I feel like 
talking, a lot. Apparently two cups of coffee 
and I love the sound of my own voice.
3:45 pm: Very aware of my surround-
ings, to a meticulous degree. I feel warm.
3:57 pm: Bourbon Street Cafe on Archer 
Road. Two stories on the outside, but only one on the inside. Very misleading.
4:03 pm: Best cup yet. Immediate kick, 
robust.  Keep checking my head for my sun-
glasses. They’re on the table in front of me.
4:04 pm: Note to self: Look up robust in 
dictionary.
4:15 pm: On the road again. Note to self, 
part two: coffee and country music go togeth-er like peanut butter and jelly.
4:25 pm: Krispy Kreme, the most cul-
tured of all Gainesville coffee destinations. Overweight couple orders three dozen 
doughnuts, then joke about needing psychi-
atric help.
4:31 pm: Corner booth. Steaming coffee, 
light and smooth. Holy crap it’s hot.
4:37 pm:  Do they heat this stuff with lava? How on earth is it still piping hot? Seem to have developed a twitch.
4:40 pm: “Shut Your Eyes” by Snow 
Patrol comes on the overheads. It’s now my favorite song of all time.
4:44 pm: Slowly losing the ability to 
form cohesive thoughts. I’m still thinking, but it goes from should I order a dougnut to a topless woman’s soccer league. That one may be gold, actually. 
4:50 pm: Book Lover’s Cafe. I love 
smoking cigarettes. They should have a smoke lover’s cafe.
5:00 pm: Coffee ice cubes, genius! 
Hazelnut blend in my hand, Strokes on the speakers.
5:09 pm: Things are dicey. Lost, walk 
by bathroom twice. In-house gardening book distracts me for a while (15 seconds).
5:20 pm: I feel like I’m Alanis Morisette 
in that video where she’s naked and every-thing’s in fast motion but her.
5:47 pm: Coffee Culture on 13th Street. 
Quiet in here. I’m afraid to speak and violate the sacred silence.
5:55 pm: The cappuccino maker pierces 
the lull with its hulky dissonance, where are the coffee police?
6:00 pm: I have officially been rocketed 
into the fourth dimension of coffee heaven...hell?
6:02 pm: I’m sweating, a lot. I can’t stop 
using the facilities (euphemism).
6:15 pm: I understand what Kirk meant 
in Star Trek when he said his body was leak-ing.
6:30 pm: The sun is heading west. Time 
to switch to the bike.
7:05 pm: I go by Norman through the 
underpass onto campus. Past the French fries to the Orange and Brew. Fail.   Closed for the 
summer. I sweat out some of this caffeine fe-ver.
7:10 pm:  Marching band in the distance. 
The flag by the pond flails in the wind while the birds echo their calls. It’s so easy to miss the quiet elegance of sundown when you haven’t had ridiculous amounts of caffeine.
7:24 pm: Deja Brew, back in the game. I’m paranoid. Everyone’s watching me. Do 
they think I’m a spy or something? Do I think I’m a spy or something?
7:30 pm: I can’t make eye contact with 
anyone without laughing. I think it’s time to go.
7:42 pm: I’m losing it. My mind that 
is, not my sense of balance, that is in perfect working order.On the way downtown, an older, short Hispanic man holds a sign on the corner of 13th Street and University Av-
enue. It says, “Jesus is coming, where will 
you spend eternity?” I feel like if I could think clearly, I would know the answer. I could tell him, and he wouldn’t have to stand out in the sun holding that heavy sign. He could go home.
7:52 pm: Volta. El Machete, washed. 
That’s the name of the coffee, seriously. I can’t 
even pronounce half of these coffee names. 
Are they trying to make me feel stupid? It’s working. Congratulations, Volta, I feel stu-pid. You have won.
8:02 pm: Emotional and mental fatigue. 
A calm and alternately frantic disconnect from reality. Strangely, I don’t feel like any-one is staring at me here, maybe they’re too involved in their own caffeine-induced psy-chosis.
8:07 pm: I’ve developed coffee-goggles. 
The portly girl outside the window is looking deceptively attractive. 
8:15 pm: Starbucks, downtown 
Gainesville. Everyone knows this coffee; I’m not going to say anything that will obliterate preconceived notions. Outside table, I’m a quiet observer. This town is alive with move-
ment and anticipation. A young couple walks 
by, and I sense carnal purpose. I officially concede to brain failure.
8:17 pm: The world has turned and left 
me here. A ghost staring through a foggy glass window, outside looking in and realiz-ing your girlfriend is sleeping with your dad.
8:20 pm: I’m careful not to fall off the 
earth as I cross the street to Maude’s.
8: 22 pm: My last stop. I sit and burn 
a cigarette. What kind of sycophant would think this was a good idea? I feel absolutely bat-shit insane. I’m going home.
8:23 pm: Note to self: Look up sycophant 
in the dictionary.Coffee binge brings aversion, reflection & perspirationcoffee culture

In an effort to improve my conversation 
skills, I’ve searched for a “universal ice break-er” — a topic so engaging it transcends barriers of age, class and gender.
After a few weeks of group conversations, I 
think I’ve found one. 
“Taken” is a movie starring Liam Neeson, 
who plays a retired CIA-operative who scours Paris looking for his kidnapped daughter. In the process, he kills just about everyone in the city. 
When my friend brought the “Taken” DVD 
to a group movie night, I was skeptical. The film went unnoticed when it hit the theaters earlier 
this year: it was released in the no-confidence 
month of January, and most critics dismissed it as “too violent” and “without story.” 
But my god, the critics were wrong. By the 
end of the night, you’d think it was an opening night screening of “Lord of the Rings” — lots of cheering, jumping and high-fives. Even the girls couldn’t help getting into it. 
“Liam just looked at that guy,” someone 
would observe. “That guy’s so dead!” 
Nine times out of 10, we would be right. Sec-
onds later, Liam Neeson would exit the frame, leaving a half dozen unconscious Parisians.   What I love most are the random peo-ple I’ve met as a result of this movie. Mention “Taken” in a group setting, and you’ll prob-ably turn a few heads.
“Are you guys talking about ‘Taken’? That 
movie was nuts. Remember the part when…”
And the fans aren’t just the college guys who 
do shots during “24,” worship Chuck Norris and rave about those “three-wolf-moon” T-shirts. Converts are everywhere.
At a party thrown by my parents, I quickly 
struck up a conversation with a 60-year-old retired Navy admi-ral about the film. He told me about a real-life “Taken” situa-tion in which he had to use his 
connections in the CIA and the 
FBI to track down his friend’s daughter, who 
was lost in Turkey. 
I dropped the title again during a quiet 
lunch with some fellow interns from work. Immediately, a bouncy, “you-mean-we-can-leave-the-sorority-house?” girl perked up on the other side of the table and started raving about it. 
“Taken” has united the interests of griz-
zled military retirees and chirpy college girls. Obama couldn’t even do that. So see “Taken.” Rent it, buy it, download — whatever’s quick-est. If you don’t, Liam Neeson will throw you off a building.‘Taken’ musters conversation

sexon the avenue‘We’re all a little gay’
Pseudo-homos — ones that pro-
claim to be straight, but have had at 
least one homosexual experience. If 
you ask them about an outer-hetero experience, they will admit to it, but soon after comes an “I’m not gay” or “I was just curious,” or “I was so drunk.” 
To illustrate, an article in the June 
2009 issue of Glamour magazine entitled “What Counts as Cheating Now?” A woman explains how her 
boyfriend came home one drunken 
night and breezily elaborated that his gay best friend had just performed oral sex on him. His excuse was that he was “throwing a dog a bone”. 
What! Honey, to me there is a big-
ger question — not “is he cheating?” It’s “is he gay?” 
So, what makes the girl that se-
cretly watches her best friend undress in the locker room and the two drunk 
girls that hook up, anything less than 
two lesbians?The Kinsey scale attempts to sim-
plistically measure one’s sexuality. The test uses a scale of zero to six to measure two extremes of sexuality. A score of zero represents extreme het-erosexuality, and a score of six repre-sents extreme homosexuality. I took a quick test online and scored a two. 
That means that while I am mostly 
heterosexual, I’ve been known to have a girl crush or two.
Ironically, I respect the lesbian 
manliness, strength and persever-ance. Because sometimes it seems that you just can’t find it in the whirlwind of liars and cheaters, or ‘real men’ as they call themselves. 
So, I understand how it can be 
comforting to know that deep down 
your partner is just like you. But me, 
I love surprises, and I love that long hard thing that males offer. I’m nei-ther a true homo, nor a hetero. I am a pseudo. 
This little realization has made me 
realize that now, more than ever, it is 
important to see the beauty within, 
because I see that it can come in any size, color, shape or gender package.ANNIE ANTHONY  �

Balancing on hands, upside-
down, with feet planted on a part-
ner’s back may not sound like a typical Sunday evening. But for those who seek new experiences, relaxation and enjoy working up a sweat, the week’s finale might bring just that. 
This summer, UF’s Department 
of Recreational Sports is offering a partnered yoga class, at 7:45 p.m. Sunday at the Racquet Club gym.
The class taught by Tara Kala-
jian, 23, and Ashton Alexander, 21, is a group-fitness class that provides one hour of bonding and molding bodies into poses never thought possible.
The department hosted it’s first 
partner-yoga class on Valentine’s Day, meant as a one-time promo-tional event. But, the abundance of positive feedback led to a per-manent slot on the Recreational Sports summer schedule. 
The class begins with breath 
centering, which is a form of pre-yoga meditation, followed by a series of Vinyasas - a sequence of poses meant to warm up the body and create blood flow. 
After 25 minutes of preparation 
the fun begins as the class transi-tions from individual practice to 
partnered poses. 
Working on one yoga mat, the 
instructors demonstrate how to 
properly get into, and stay in, the pose without falling off one’s part-ner. 
The tutors  stroll across the 
room frequently, ensuring the pos-es are executed correctly to avoid injury. They also guide students to  follow the yoga principles of prop-er breathing and maintaining form throughout the practice.Partners are provided for any-
one without a partner, so single yogis are welcome to the class too.
“We are all open minded here,” 
says Alexander. “Just be sure to get comfortable with that person because you are going to be touch-ing them.” 
New partners don’t have a 
choice when it comes to getting comfortable. 
Within minutes of meeting each 
other, they will sit face-to-face, spread eagle on the floor, holding hands. For some, these actions may 
seem far from relaxing and much closer to an uncomfort-able situation. 
 But the laughter and light 
atmosphere of the class melts away any awkwardness. 
The benefits of partner yoga are 
well recognized among the yogi community. The added tension, pressure and weight of another body help sink each person into a deeper stretch. 
“You get that release with some-
one else’s weight and support that you can’t do if you were just on your own,” Kalajian said. “It sup-ports you not only physically, but 
emotionally as well.”
To get the most out of each 
pose, instructors promote strong 
communication among partners. 
It is about being aware not only 
of oneself, but also the feelings of another. Alexander said there is also a social and spiritual benefit. 
“We live in a society where peo-
ple are very hesitant of strangers. Partner yoga definitely helps break the social barrier between people. Some students come in without a partner and leave having made a new friend,” Alexander said. “Partner yoga gives people the 
chance to get out of their bodies 
and into their minds.”
Although the class might seem 
intimidating, there is no experience 
needed to master partner yoga work. All pupils need is a friendly spirit and an open mind. 
“Some positions look really 
hard, but when you try them they’re not so scary,” said Wenya Wang, a UF physics graduate stu-dent.   Partner downward facing dog, 
for example, is a yoga asana so in-tricate it appears to be a trick made 
for acrobats defying gravity. But 
much to the class’ surprise, every 
couple in the room was able to pull off the pose elegantly.
The last five- to 10 minutes of 
every class, students are rewarded with a period of final relaxation, or Shavasana, intended to rejuvenate one’s body, mind and spirit. 
The instructors guide students 
through a tour of the mind encour-aging each student to watch his or her thoughts. 
“Forget about what you were 
doing before, or what you’re go-
ing to be doing later. Concentrate 
on right now,” Alexander instructs 
her class. “Thank yourselves for coming here tonight.”
At 8:45 on Sunday evening, stu-
dents leave the class enlightened and maybe a little sore.
Before they go, they are sent 
off with one final note: The light within me honors and respects the light within you, or in yogi tongue, “Namaste.”

His face greeted customers at 
American Apparel. He shopped 
regularly at Wolfgang and became one of the main faces of the store’s fashion show in the spring. He reli-giously rode the bike he bought at Spin Cycle and on some nights he 
went out to Sharab Lounge. 
Barry Bernard, 25, died in a 
beach accident at Matanzas Inlet on 
May 24, but his memory and legacy will live on in Gainesville thanks to the community and his friends that have united to raise money for his family. 
On Thursday, Sharab Lounge 
will host a silent auction for Ber-nard’s family. The lounge will also donate funds collected from the $5 cover fee on Friday from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. 
Gustavo Bonet, the general man-
ager at Sharab Lounge, said that im-mediately upon hearing the news, Sharab along with other local busi-
nesses organized the event.
The auction will feature items 
from Wolfgang, salon products and 
services, a year membership to the Gainesville Gun Club and a dress made by local designer, Bobby K. 
“It’s really great to see the com-
munity come together and do this for a friend,” Bonet said. “Sharab’s doors are open to any event in his name and in his memory. Hosting an event is the least we can do.” 
Sharab will open two hours ear-
lier than usual on Friday and some of Bernard’s favorite local bands will 
play at the lounge.  
In commemoration of Bernard, 
the featured drink will be gin and 
tonic, his favorite cocktail. 
The proceeds will go toward fu-
neral costs and Bernard’s girlfriend and family to start a charity in Ber-nard’s name — he always said he wanted to go into social services. 
Last week, Shooting Star restau-
rant raised money on their outdoor deck bar with drink specials and live bands. A portion of the sales went to Bernard’s family. Alcove Beer and Wine Bar held a similar event. 
Wolfgang held a 25-percent-off 
sale all weekend and owner Mat-thew Turner donated 25 percent of 
sales to the family. There is a collec-
tion drawer at the checkout counter of the store. Through both efforts, the store has raised more than $600.
“Barry was one of my good 
friends, a model in the fashion show and a pretty regular shopper,” said Turner. “I felt it was necessary to give back as much as he gave us.” 
The money raised will be used 
to obtain emergency visas for Ber-nard’s family from Canada and Haiti to attend the funeral. 
On May 29, the monthly Critical 
Mass bicycle ride was dedicated to Bernard. Spoke cards with Bernard’s photo and initials were sold before, 
during and after the race. Approxi-
mately $100 was collected from the card sales.
Spin Cycle, 424 W. University 
Ave., hosted a fundraising potluck dinner at the bicycle store on May 27. Bernard frequently visited the store and had a good relationship 
with the employees. 
“Barry was a close friend of the 
shop,” said Jacob Adams, the store’s 
general manager.
“It was a business relationship 
that became a personal relation-ship.” Community raises
funds for local man

OKLAHOMA CITY – Two nights 
after triumphantly rounding the bases 
and getting buried at the bottom of a dogpile following her walk-off grand slam against Alabama, Ali Gardiner fell to her knees beside home plate with her head in her hands.
Washington’s Danielle Lawrie 
struck out the senior first baseman for the final out in the top of the sev-enth inning, giving the Huskies a 3-2 win over the top-ranked Gators and their first-ever national championship Tuesday night in ASA Hall of Fame Stadium.
Third-seeded Washington (51-12) 
wasn’t as dominant as it was in its eight-run blowout victory Monday night, but the Huskies were good enough to keep the Gators (63-5) from pushing the Women’s College World Series championship series to three games.
Over the last two years, UF went 
133-10, and the team topped many of the marks it set last season in 2009, including school records for team batting average (.323), slugging per-centage (.543) and on-base percentage (.423).
This season, three players broke 
eight single-season school records, including runs (69, Aja Paculba), home runs (18, Francesca Enea) and slugging percentage (.713, Enea and Kelsey Bruder).
But Washington, which was re-
sponsible for three of the Gators’ five losses this year, kept UF from achiev-ing its season-long goal of a national championship.
Unlike the teams’ two previous 
matchups, UF found some success against Lawrie (42-8, 0.97 ERA). 
The Gators managed seven hits off 
the USA Softball National Collegiate Player of the Year, three more than they had in the last two meetings com-bined.
But after the first inning, Law-
rie kept UF off the board, leaving 10 runners on base en route to an eight-strikeout performance and her second Gators sent home by 
dominant pitching

� THE NO. 10 GATORS WILL 
HOST SOUTHERN MISS.

Last weekend the Gators van-
quished a common foe. Now they must get past an unfamiliar team to continue their journey.
The No. 10 UF baseball team (42-20), 
winners of the No. 8 national seed, will host Southern Miss (38-24) this week-end in a best-of-three Super Regional with a College World Series berth on the line. The Gators and Golden Eagles will open play Saturday at 3 p.m. Game 2 will be play Sunday at 7 p.m., with an if-necessary Game 3 scheduled for Monday at either 1 p.m. or  7 p.m.
UF and Southern Miss, winners of 
the Atlanta Regional, have never met in the postseason and will be meeting for only the second time ever.
It will be the Gators’ first Super Re-
gionals appearance since hosting one in 2005 en route to a trip to Omaha, home of the CWS. Considering that UF advanced out of a Regional contain-ing Miami for the first time in 11 tries last weekend, the optimism is high in Gainesville.
“It’s the first time I’ve been part of 
a team like this,” sophomore second 
baseman Josh Adams said.
Junior center field-
er Matt den Dekker added: “It’s a special group, we’re looking 
for big things to come.”
If UF performs at the plate and on 
the mound like it did last weekend, it will have a good chance. The Golden Eagles finished fifth in Conference USA, although Southern Miss did defeat host UF hosts Super Regional

“Hindsight is 50/50.”
That’s what a room full of 
reporters heard from Arizona 
and Team USA softball coach Mike Can-drea after the Gators dominated the Wild-cats in the opening round of the Women’s College World Series.
There was laughter, and everyone knew 
what he meant, but I would argue that his statement was more of a Freudian slip than a verbal miscue.
Sure, blurry questions can come into fo-
cus afterwardss, but usually there is no cer-tain way to explain previous happenings.
As I watched Stacey Nelson, the most 
consistently dominant athlete at UF since I came to Gainesville in 2006, unravel in the final three games of the tournament, like everyone else, I was searching for answers to burning ques-tions.
Why doesn’t she 
look like herself?
Has she been 
overused?
How could this 
happen in the final hours of her career?
Will she get it 
back?
Even after the scenario played out in 
front of me, I have no concrete answers. I look back on the last three games of Nel-son’s career with the clarity of my bedroom before I slip on my glasses in the morning.
The same pitcher who carried the Gators 
to a 133-10 record over the last two seasons couldn’t seal the deal and go out on top.Nelson’s demise hard to foresee

LOS ANGELES — Leave all that cold-blooded seriousness 
to Kobe Bryant. Orlando Magic star Dwight Howard is going 
to have fun in his first NBA finals.
“I’m always going to be that silly person,” Howard said 
Wednesday before practice at the Staples Center. “Basketball brings too much joy to me and everybody who watches me. So there’s no need to be out there trying to look mean and tough. 
Even if I tried to look mean and tough, everybody in here 
would laugh and say, ‘That’s not him.’ So it doesn’t work.”
Howard’s dead-on impersonation of hyped-up Orlando 
coach Stan Van Gundy has been making the rounds.
“Dwight is a funny guy,” Van Gundy said. “We hear this 
stuff all the time.”
As a kid growing up in Atlanta, Howard inherited his fa-
ther’s sense of fun, although he got scolded by dad for goofing around too much on the court.
“I laughed, I joked,” Howard recalled. 
“But if I lost the game, I was the first one cry-ing and telling him what I needed to do to get 
better for the next game.”
Orlando general manager Otis Smith tried to change How-
ard after the team selected him with the No. 1 pick in the 2004 
NBA draft.
“He tried to stop me from smiling on the floor, and it’s not 
going to work,” Howard said.
Bryant said his 23-year-old U.S. Olympic teammate never 
had to grow into his role as the centerpiece of Orlando’s fran-chise.
“He did a great job of that right off the bat,” Bryant said. 
“He’s a natural. The thing about Dwight is he continues to work 
on his game and you see improvement, sometimes monthly. You see him adding new things to his game, which says a lot about him.”

PARIS — Serena Williams, of 
all people, got a case of the jitters.
That was her explanation, any-
way.
The 10-time Grand Slam cham-
pion kept finding herself in, then 
out of, trouble in the French Open quarterfinals Wednesday, until she ran out of stamina and strokes down the stretch of a 7-6 (3), 5-7, 7-5 loss to Svetlana Kuznetsova that ended Williams’ 18-match winning streak at major tourna-ments.
“I had an opportunity, and I 
got really tight, and I pretty much gave it to her,” said the second-seeded Williams, who blew a 3-1 lead in the third set. “It was like, ‘Here. Do you want to go to the semis? Because I don’t.’ She was like, ‘OK.’”
The seventh-seeded Kuznetso-
va’s semifinal opponent Thursday is No. 30 Samantha Stosur of Aus-tralia, who defeated Sorana Cirstea of Romania 6-1, 6-3. 
The other women’s semifinal 
is No. 1 Dinara Safina of Russia against No. 20 Dominika Cibulko-va of Slovakia.
If Stosur-Cirstea was as one-
sided as could be, Kuznetsova-Williams was hyper-competitive 
and superbly played. 
Until, at least, Kuznetsova took 
eight of the last nine points, break-
ing Williams in the final game.
“Honestly, I think I lost because 
of me,” Williams said, “and not be-cause of anything she did.”
Williams denied she felt fa-
tigued, blaming nerves instead.
How could that be?“Maybe I put some expecta-
tions on myself that I didn’t put on myself initially,” she said.
Roger Federer dealt with nerves 
Wednesday too, although his problems came before he began playing 11th-seeded Gael Monfils of France.
“We’re all nervous at this stage of the competition. I felt it. Yester-day I felt it, and I felt it again to-day in the warmup,” said Federer, who knows this might be his best chance to win the only Grand Slam tournament missing from his re-sume.Serena ousted from French OpenHoward ready for

OKLAHOMA CITY — Replac-
ing the most storied senior class in 
UF softball history won’t be easy for coach Tim Walton and the 13 other players on this year’s team. 
But due to injuries, a wealth of 
talent and a few points this season where Walton ran out a team with-out a senior on the field, the future is still bright for the Gators.
“The program itself will go for-
ward,” Walton said. “Hopefully we’ll be able to get enough good character and enough good play-
ers that will continue to build what 
we’re building.”
The lineup will definitely look 
different without Ali Gardiner 
anchoring the infield at first, Kris-
tina Hilberth behind the plate, 
Kim Waleszonia in center field or Stacey Nelson in the circle, but UF has enough young talent to remain 
competitive on the national scene 
next year and possibly make its 
third straight trip to the Women’s College World Series.
The biggest change will be the 
transition of Stephanie Brombach-
er from reliable backup pitcher to 
everyday starter. The sophomore is undefeated at UF and will face the tall order of replacing Nelson and facing other top pitchers.
Tiffany DeFelice will take over 
for Hilberth to catch for her team-mate since high school.“Hopefully we develop Stepha-
nie and we’ll be able to pass the torch to her,” Walton said. “We’ll get Tiffany behind the plate a little bit more next year to help fill the void, too.”
Freshmen Michelle Moultrie, 
Tuesday night’s starting cen-ter fielder, and Alicia Sisco saw time in the outfield this year with Waleszonia out for the majority of the season with a fractured knee. Both will likely start next season.
“I think we’ve developed Mi-
chelle Moultrie into at least be-ing able to provide a lift,” Walton said. “Alicia Sisco could play on any team in the country but just couldn’t find a way into this line-up.”
Kelsey Bruder, a natural in-
fielder who moved to first base on a few occasions should make 
the move to first a permanent one, 
freeing up right field for Sisco.
The rest of the lineup should 
remain intact with Aja Paculba at second, Megan Bush at shortstop, 
Corrie Brooks at third and Franc-
esca Enea in left field. 
The speed of Moultrie and Sisco 
will complement Paculba batting leadoff, the versatility of DeFelice 
and the dangerous power hitters 
remaining in the lineup: Enea, Bruder, Bush and Brooks. 
UF will also add five freshmen: 
Ensley Gammel, a pitcher from Ba-
kersfield, Calif.; Samantha Holle, 
an infielder from Tampa; Kelsey Horton, a catcher from Valrico; Brittany Schutte, a utility player 
from Fountain Valley, Calif.; and 
Brittany Walker, an infielder from 
Tomball, Texas.THURSDAY, JUNE 4, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 27

UF pitcher Stephanie Brombacher will have to take over the role as full-time starter for the 2010 Gators. She is still undefeated during her time in Gainesville.
Departure of senior superstars leads to new challenges
Georgia Tech twice in three days in last weekend’s 
Regional. 
While the Gators have not yet announced Satur-
day’s starter, lefty Stephen Locke is coming off one of his best career starts against Miami in a 8-2 victory. Locke (5-2, 4.02 ERA) went 7.1 innings on Saturday and gave up only two unearned runs.
The pitching staff likely felt even less pressure 
last weekend with UF’s offensive explosion in two games against Miami. The Gators scored just eight runs against the Hurricanes in the early part of the season but matched that total in just Saturday’s game and finished with 24 runs in two games.
A big part of the attack was freshman first base-
man Preston Tucker, who hit .692 and had two HR and six RBIs to earn Regional MVP honors. But it became a total team effort as UF racked up 22 hits in Sunday night’s Regional-clinching victory, tying a school postseason record. Every Gators starter ex-cept Avery Barnes had multiple hits.
“When one guy’s seeing the ball, he’ll come back 
in the dugout and say it looks like a beach ball to them,” Adams said. “Next thing you know, the next guy hits a double. Once this team starts hitting, it’s kinda hard to stop us.”Offensive outburts take 
pressure off pitching staff
straight victory against the Gators — the team’s first back-to-back losses since March 31, 2007.
“There’s a reason she’s the Most 
Outstanding Player of the tourna-ment and probably the best pitcher in the country and one of the best pitchers in the world,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “It seemed like every time we got somebody on base, she revved it up another gear. 
“The last two innings, she prob-
ably revved it up two more gears.”
Lawrie said she was motivated 
by comments made by Walton af-ter she defeated the Gators in Palm Springs, Calif., with a two-hit, nine-inning shutout.“One thing I did remember, and 
that’s when we played them in Palm Springs — and I feel fine saying this — but I remember him coming out and saying, ‘My team is like a UCLA or an Arizona,’ after we beat them,” 
Lawrie said. “I re-member hearing him say that and not giving us any recognition for how we played.”
The Gators 
scored early — a 
vast improvement 
from only swinging at one pitch in the first inning Monday night — put-ting up one run after Paculba tripled and ran home on a passed ball, UF’s first run of the tournament that did not come off a home run.
They added another when Kris-
tina Hilberth reached on an error, moved to second on an infield single by Enea, stole third and scored on Megan Bush’s sacrifice fly.
But Washington immediately re-
sponded, stringing together three hits off pitcher Stacey Nelson (41-5, 0.61 ERA), who had her third straight shaky start in the circle.
The senior gave up six hits and 
two earned runs in the final six in-nings of her college career.
“Losing sucks, especially on this 
stage,” Nelson said. “There is a lot of pain that comes with the loss, but I’m always going to remember my time at Florida as the best time of my life.”Only three wins away from a championship, Nelson 
owned an impossibly low 0.39 ERA and was coming off shutouts against Arizona and Michigan.
She then gave up 14 runs in 16 innings against Ala-
bama and Washington on the way to a runner-up finish. In her previous 269.1 innings this year, she allowed just 26 runners to cross home plate.
The Gators were still almost good enough to capture 
the title as Ali Gardiner hit a walk-off grand slam off Ala-bama ace Kelsi Dunne, and the offense put seven hits and two runs on the board against WCWS Most Outstanding Player Danielle Lawrie in Tuesday’s final contest.
But this was supposed to be Nelson’s time. UF wasn’t 
supposed to have to win games 6-5 and 4-3.
The best-kept secret of the entire tournament is that 
Lawrie wasn’t as good as advertised — not even close. Georgia scored 11 runs on the Olympian in two games, 
and the Gators had a lot of success in the second champi-onship matchup. Last year, UF beat player of the year An-gela Tincher, who struck out 19 Gators, and First-Team All-America pitchers Anjelica Seldon and Megan Gibson. 
UF has proven that it is capable of beating pitchers of 
Lawrie’s caliber, but not without Nelson matching them.
What’s even more confusing is that head-
ing into that nightmare stretch, the question ap-peared to be if anyone could match Nelson pitch for pitch.The right-hander seemed to be on a level that even she had seldom tapped into over her career. She was shutting out teams with a freakish regularity, and she had the experience and poise to go all the way. I’m not sure that anyone, including Nel-son herself, can explain what transpired dur-ing the stretch run of UF’s 2009 campaign. And no amount of time away from the situation will bring that into focus.
