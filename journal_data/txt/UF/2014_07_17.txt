After closing its doors due to 
infrastructural problems, The 
Jones management and staff are 
looking to make its remaining lo-
cation stronger than ever. 
They are looking at the bright 
side of the situation, despite clo-
sures to the  Eastside location last 
week.  
Audrey Dingeman, general 
manager of The Jones, said it was a positive business move. 
The business is now entirely run 
out of The Jones B-side location downtown. 
“We’d really like to focus on 
putting all our love we’ve put into the community and our cli-entele and put it in one location,” she said. 
The 38-seat restaurant served 
breakfast and lunch at the 401 NE 23rd Ave. location since August 2005.  Dingeman said The Jones Eastside was in an old building 
and needed work, which was be-
yond the management’s control, prompting the restaurant’s clo-sure. 
Gladys Alvear, front-of-house 
manager of The Jones, said she will miss the Eastside. Because it was next to both a laundromat and a pawn shop, the restaurant 
drew in unique customers. 
“We had a solid crowd of peo-
ple that would come over just be-
cause they were doing laundry,” she said. 
Alvear said she’s excited about 
bringing the Eastside’s breakfast menu to The Jones B-side. 
“I think it’s going to add to the 
atmosphere here,” Alvear said. 
Its popular breakfast items — 
including the pancakes, ranche-ros and bagel sandwiches — are now being served at The Jones 
B-Side, which is taking over the 
breakfast menu and other menu items from the Eastside location. VOLUME 108 ISSUE 161 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, JULY 17, 2014

When Natalie Fischer was 15, a 
police ofﬁ  cer pulled her over in Mi-
ami for blaring music in her car.
The now 21-year-old UF adver-
tising senior said she didn’t get a ticket, and the police ofﬁ  cer let her go with just a warning.
But starting Aug. 1, Gainesville 
residents won’t be so lucky.
The Gainesville Police Depart-
ment will soon begin to enforce the sound issue against vehicles with 
loud stereos. 
After a warning, ﬁ  nes will begin 
at $271 and increase to $521 after 
a third warning, according to Ben 
Tobias, GPD Public Information 
Ofﬁ  cer.
The change happened because 
of complaints from students and Gainesville residents. 
“It’s a college town,” he said, “but there’s a mixture of people who live and work in the city who 
don’t want to be disturbed.”
Noise ordinance violations in-
clude anything that disturbs a per-
son’s normal sensitivities and ex-ceeds the 200 feet from the property 
line, according to the Gainesville 
Police website.
The most common noise com-
plaints are loud parties, barking 
dogs, construction, power tools and 
loud stereos, according to the web-site.
Fischer doesn’t remember the 
song she played when the police 
pulled her over but said it was 
something by the Strobes. 
She said she has mixed feelings 
about the newly enforced law.
“To some extent it’s good,” she 
said, “but people should also be al-
lowed to play their music the way 
they want it.”Sound violations enforcedLOCAL

Gainesville-based startup 
Grooveshark is now accept-ing bitcoin as a form of pay-ment.
This popular cryptocur-
rency can be used alongside usual payment methods such as Visa, MasterCard and Pay-Pal to pay for online monthly and yearly subscriptions.
Co-founder and CEO of 
Grooveshark Sam Tarantino wrote in an email that he believes in Bitcoin as a long-
term currency of the future 
and wants to make sure that Grooveshark is helping push its adoption.  
“If merchant acceptance 
reaches 75%+ than I think we could see more and more of the population start using it as a primary payment meth-
od,” he said.
President of the UF En-
trepreneurship Club Erick 
Rodriguez, a 20-year-old UF management junior, said Bitcoin has the upper hand over companies like PayPal 
because it has no transaction 
fees and adds a layer of ano-nymity to all transactions.
“International payments 
are made easier because 
bitcoins aren’t tied to any 
country or subject to any regulation,” Rodriguez said. “However, some drawbacks 
about Bitcoin are the digital 
wallets bitcoins are stored in, which are not protected by FDIC insurance and are sus-ceptible to hacking.”
Sean Treiser, a 20-year-old 
UF economics junior, said many online companies are now accepting bitcoin.
“Paying with bitcoin is a 
large investment,” Treiser said, “so a student who would use bitcoin should be pretty serious about trading.”Grooveshark membership

UF’s Student Senate passed three pieces 
of legislation during its Tuesday meeting.
Resolution 2014-1043 thanked Gov. Rick 
Scott and the Florida Legislature for their ac-
tions to beneﬁ  t higher education.
This includes both the G.I. Bill, which 
grants in-state tuition to any honorably dis-charged veteran, and the tuition equity bill, which gives in-state tuition to qualiﬁ  ed un-documented students. Senators also thanked the legislature for the allocated $100 million to UF this year.
Student Body President Cory Yeffet 
called this a “big honor and big win for stu-dents.”
Bill 2014-1042 granted $25,000 of funding 
to the Health Outreach Assembly, a student-led organization that sends faculty, students and physicians to conduct relief missions in 
third-world countries. According to the bill, 
the primary recipients of this funding are 
non-UF students.
Chairman of the budget and allocations 
committee, Sen. Davis Bean called HOA “a great organization on a great track to be self-
sustaining.”
This year the organization will receive 
$25,000, which will decline to $15,000 for 2015-2016 and $5,000 for 2016-2017. After that, funding will cease. This amount is not guaranteed, but SG doesn’t intend to fund more than that.
“HOA does great things around the globe 
and for the UF name,” Bean said.
Outdoor Adventure Recreation, an ad-
venture club for UF students, also received 
$2,708 from the allocations committee in 
Senate Bill 2014-1044 to buy two new ca-noes.
Former president and current member 
Nelson Anderson said the group has a trail-er that holds six canoes and that not all of 
the group’s canoes are in good condition.
“Now we’ll have six good ones to ﬁ  ll the 
trailer,” he said.
Yeffet also announced he had written his 
ﬁ  rst blog post as student body president.
“Check back later this week, there may 
be a second one,” he said.

This summer, two UF students will rep-
resent their school with ﬁ  shing poles in 
hand.
On the Chatuge Reservoir in Northeast 
Georgia, 167 people will compete in the 2014 
Carhartt Bassmaster College Series National 
Championship. These students represent 58 different colleges and will ﬁ  sh to win cash, prizes and to move on to the next stage of the competition.
Hank Weldon, tournament manager for 
the college series, said this will be the big-gest championship so far.
When the tournament ﬁ  rst began in 2011, 
only 49 universities participated and only 
115 people competed.
Shelby Concon and Kyle Smith, mem-
bers of the Gator BassMasters club, will put 
their skills to the test and represent UF in the three-day tournament.
The duo qualiﬁ  ed to compete in the 
championship after ﬁ  shing the South Re-gional on Lake Okeechobee, where they ﬁ  n-ished third out of 119 teams.
Come July 31, the two will cast off in 
Smith’s 19-foot, yellow and white Skeeter 
Boat.
They will reel in and keep the ﬁ  ve big-
gest bass they catch each day. The competi-
tion goes by the combined weight of the ﬁ  sh over the course of the three days, and the highest overall weight wins.
Concon, president of Gator BassMasters, 
started ﬁ  shing competitively in his junior year of college. The 21-year-old is now go-
ing into his senior year majoring in mechan-
ical engineering.
He knows the skill of his competition will 
be at its peak in this tournament, but he isn’t worried. He said he enjoys the competition.
“You have to try your best and hope to 
get a little lucky,” he said.
Smith, 26, is a structural engineering se-
nior and is thrilled that he gets to compete 
in the championship before he graduates.
It is the ﬁ  rst time he has qualiﬁ  ed for the 
championship and is taking time off from 
his summer internship with BP to compete.
Smith will take off just three days for the 
tournament and will miss the pre-ﬁ  shing week, which is designated time for the colle-giate anglers to learn the new body of water and develop a strategy.
He said that week is especially important because the body of water will not be like Florida’s water, and it will take experiment-ing to see what tactics work.
He will rely heavily on what Concon dis-covers in that week and hope for the best.
Smith’s birthday is July 31, the day the 
competition starts. He said his birthday 
wish is to win.
Two UF students hope to reel in summer ﬁ  shing championship

Best-selling author Rebecca Donovan is 
promoting her new book, “What If,” using 
moments captured on UF’s campus.
Video production is led by two recent 
UF graduates, Brooks Allen, 24, and Luke 
McGurrin, 23. Allen said they will be on the 
Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through Friday to ﬁ  nd students.
Donovan said these video confessions 
are about students’ “what if” moments. It is a way for people to reﬂ  ect on choices they 
have made and how it altered the course of 
their lives.
They will be compiled to create 60-sec-ond episodes released daily starting Sept. 2 to promote the launch of her book. Her e-book will be released Sept. 16. 
She said her book “What If” is about four 
friends who grew up together and went their separate ways after high school.
She said she hopes her project creates a 
movement of people being aware of the type of power they have over their lives.
“That is why we chose the University of 
Florida because you guys have that energy, that unique outlook to launch the whole movement in a way,” she said.
Catherine Ordoñez, 21-year-old UF pub-
lic relations and English senior, said she feels students may have a lot to say about their 
“what if” moments. 
She said her confession would be, “What if 
I didn’t apply for the Cicerones, then I would 
have never found my niche on campus.”Author asks students ‘What If?’Most of the staff from the 
Eastside will join the B-side
“A lot of these items were high in de-
mand,” she said. 
Dingeman said that most of the staff 
from the Eastside will join the B-Side 
location. 
“We’re going to work very hard to 
try to get more of an Eastside feel down 
here,” Dingeman said. 
Jones regular Christopher Garland, a 
32-year-old UF English Ph.D. candidate, 
said he thinks bringing breakfast to the B-side will attract more customers to 
the restaurant. 
“I think people will feel like coming 
here because they’ve had positive expe-
riences at the Eastside,” he said. “I think the strong parts of the Eastside can be brought to the B-side.” 
Dingeman said the B-Side location 
will be serving the former Eastside’s breakfast menu from 8 to 11 a.m. 
She said she hopes nostalgic Eastside 
regulars will come enjoy its breakfast menu at the B side.
“We want them to know we’re 
mourning the loss as well,” Dingeman said, “and we’d like to mourn togeth-er.”JONES , from page 1“You have to try your best and

We hate to start Darts and Laurels off on a somber 
note, but animal cruelty is something this edito-rial board passionately stands against. Two Clay 
County girls are being investigated by Florida law enforce-ment ofﬁ  cers after they posted a video of themselves burn-ing a Gopher tortoise and torturing it to death. The Gopher tortoise, which is an endangered species in Florida, was lit 
on ﬁ  re several times as the girls ﬁ  lmed it and said things 
like: “Burn baby, burn baby,” and “Now you’re scared of us, huh?” The girls also repeatedly threw it against the con-crete and stomped on it, crushing its shell. 
Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 
spokeswoman Karen Parker told the Florida Times-Union that the girls, who are 18 and 15 years old, could potentially be charged with animal cruelty and killing or wounding an endangered species. “We received quite a few complaints 
about this and a call from the Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, so we had 
an ofﬁ  cer go out last night,” Parker said. “... Everybody is pretty much sickened by it and can’t believe someone would do that to an innocent animal.” So this week we are giving a how-could-somebody-do-this-to-an-innocent-
tortoise DART to the two girls. 
On the bright side, our woman crush of the week goes 
to Kacy Catanzaro, the ﬁ  rst woman to complete the Dallas Finals of the “American Ninja Warrior” course. Catanzaro, 
a former NCAA Southeast Regional gymnast of the year, 
leapt, ﬂ  ipped and climbed her way through the insane ob-stacles on the course. If only the announcers could get over the fact that she’s only ﬁ  ve feet tall. Here’s a it-doesn’t-
matter-how-tall-you-are-you-go-girl LAUREL to Kacy. 
When Lana Del Rey intones, “Hot summer nights/mid-
July/when you and I were forever wild,” we don’t think she was talking about Burmese pythons. 
The reptiles that have descended upon the Everglades 
faster than ﬂ  ower-crowned faux-bohemians on Coachella are multiplying faster than ever: USA Today reported this week that the Conservancy of Southwest Florida is warn-ing Florida residents to be extra watchful for them, as Bur-mese babies hatch the most frequently during the summer 
months. 
In keeping consistent with our environmentalist theme 
for this edition of Darts and Laurels, we’re tossing a DART  
at all the morons who dumped their exotic pet snakes in 
the Everglades in the ﬁ  rst place, thus causing this python 
problem. 
Ten Florida scientists tossed some serious shade at Gov. 
Rick Scott this week when they wrote to him asking for an opportunity to tutor him on global warming. 
“We note you have been asked several times about how, 
as Governor, you will handle the issue of climate change. You responded that you are ‘not a scientist.’ We are scien-tists and we would like the opportunity to explain what is 
at stake for our state,” their letter stated. 
Though their intentions were probably more on the 
side of genuine concern and less on the side of sass, we’re 
awarding them a you-just-do-you LAUREL. 
Have a great weekend, y’all. Watch out for stray py-
thons!Lousy governors for Florida and Georgia
Florida and Georgia are rivals on a sizable scale. The an-
nual football game between UF and the University of Georgia in Jacksonville can resemble preparations for 
a large war between two enemies, but it seems that the two rivals have more in common than we think.
Both states have incumbent governors that need to go.The lack of ethics and alleged corruption oozing from 
governor’s mansions in Tallahassee and Atlanta make the two southern states top targets for Democrats this fall and for good reason.
The alleged corruption might not reach the scale of the 
Nixon administration, but Florida’s Rick  Scott and Georgia’s Nathan Deal are making headlines with decisions that make them both look like Nixon-wannabes.
What they fail to understand is that Nixon would laugh 
at the childish games carried out by Scott and Deal. Childish games or not, it’s time for both governors to get the boot this fall. Scott and Deal rode the Tea Party wave to victory in 2010 and just four years later, their own poor decisions and hubris might cost them their respective jobs.
Perhaps voters in Florida and Georgia didn’t vet their gu-
bernatorial candidates well enough, or perhaps they didn’t care. Hatred for the Obama administration led to the Republi-
can victories in 2010, but the results of those elections put the 
southern rivals on a far more politically destructive path.
Rick Scott — our humble governor — was once CEO of 
a company that defrauded the federal government out of millions in Medicaid and Medicare money. Scott’s company, Columbia/Hospital Corporation of America, plead guilty and agreed to a $600 million ﬁ  ne. When called on to testify, Scott plead the Fifth. 
His reward? A fresh start in Florida. And just seven short 
years after he made Florida home, he was its chief executive.
Scott’s time as governor has been marred by controversy 
and the appearance of impropriety. In just one example of Scott’s hubris, he rejected $2.4 billion in federal money to start construction of a much-needed high-speed rail line in Florida. A top advisor to Scott — Adam Hollingsworth — had told Scott to reject the money, claiming that cost over-runs could cost Floridians billions. Now, Hollingsworth is singing 
a different tune.
After taking a job with an in-
frastructure company, Hollings-worth started lobbying Scott’s of-
ﬁ  ce to fund high-speed rail. Scott’s 
now on board for trains in Florida, and instead of accepting free mon-ey from the feds, Florida taxpayers are on the hook for millions. 
Hooray for transparent and honest government!Nathan Deal — the Republican governor of Georgia — 
was once a Democratic member of Congress, and then like all good politicians, he switched parties during the 1990s.
Deal resigned from Congress to focus on the gubernato-
rial race in 2010, but he had a dirty little secret: Congressional ofﬁ  cials opened an ethics investigation to look at how Deal was earning income outside of Congress.
By resigning, the investigation ended and Deal was free 
to run for governor without the fear or a censure or crimi-nal investigation. Ethical problems are once again plaguing Deal, whose administration is accused of meddling with the state ethics commission, in an attempt to end an investiga-
tion into Deal’s 2010 campaign.
Democratic challengers to both governors are within 
striking distance and if Scott and Deal can’t turn it around 
soon, Florida and Georgia will likely have new governors come January.
If Florida and Georgia’s football teams don’t win, it’s 
likely the end of the road for the schools’ coaches. The same may be true for Rick Scott and Nathan Deal. Over the last four years, they’ve made a mess of their states and what was 
shared with you today only scratches the surface.
In fact, Google Scott or Deal’s name followed by contro-

Tuesday’s Alligator column voiced 
misconceptions regarding the situa-tion between the Palestinian Author-
ity and Israel. The real problem is not Is-rael, but Hamas. 
Hamas is a foreign terrorist organization 
that has hijacked the education of Palestin-ian children, indoctrinating them to hate Jews, Israel and America. Hamas is respon-sible for terror attacks and suicide bomb-ings, which killed hundreds of Israeli civil-ians. Because Hamas effectively controls the PA, it is difﬁ  cult to believe its denial of responsibil-ity for the murder of three Israeli teenagers — Naftali Frankel, Eyal Yifrach and Gilad Shaar. They were murdered for no other reason than simply being Israeli. Israel does not inﬂ  ict “col-lective punishment” on Palestinians. To the contrary, Israel humanely selects mili-tary targets and drops leaﬂ  ets in the sur-rounding area to warn nearby civilian residents. Hamas cow-ardly hides behind Palestinian civilians by storing missiles in homes, then brings the conﬂ  ict 
to its own citizens’ doorsteps by launching rockets from civilian areas. Worse, Hamas further endangers its own people by telling them to ignore Israel’s warnings. Israel has demonstrated concern for Palestinian lives, but it cannot be expected to ignore the hun-dreds of rockets that Hamas has ﬁ  red from Gaza without destroying its capability to do so. By warning the PA of an impending strike, Israel demonstrates that it does val-ue life — including the same lives of those who rejoice in the streets when Hamas murders Israeli civilians.

Hobby Lobby decision
Let’s not be distracted by the 
hype: At the heart of the recent Hob-
by Lobby Supreme Court decision, the issue was solely about power. The majority decision, delivered by 
Justice Samuel Alito, and even the 
oral arguments from Hobby Lobby, instead tried to cloak the corpora-tion’s discriminatory, anti-woman, anti-family practice of denying to cover certain birth control methods under the Religious Freedom Res-toration Act of 1993. Since corpo-rations are currently granted “per-
sonhood” under the law, the rights of corporations now ofﬁ  cially seem 
to outweigh those of women.
Health care beneﬁ  ts are part of 
the workers’ pay. It is compensa-tion for their work.  With this de-cision, Hobby Lobby and the other 100 corporations are dictating how the workers can spend their own hard-earned money. 
This particular decree of what 
a female employee can and can-not do with her money is merely a 
power struggle and has to do with 
the power of the reproductive au-tonomy of women. The Roberts-led Court’s weak 5-4 majority decision in favor of Hobby Lobby’s exemp-tion is misogynistic, anti-family and completely unjust. Yet, despite 
the misguided majority opinion pe-
nalizing women for being women, the views of a corporation’s rep-resentatives do not outweigh the views and morals of its employees. Do you believe a legal contract has more intrinsic value than a human woman?
In addition to the civil rights vio-
lations, this decision places undue burdens on American women. For a full-time, minimum-wage earner to afford an intrauterine device — effective, but now no longer cov-ered — she will have to save about a month of earnings. For a male em-
ployee at the same business to ob-
tain medicine for erectile dysfunc-tion, he has to save approximately $4. Vasectomy? Covered. Hobby Lobby, et al, relied on pseudo-sci-ence before the Supreme Court; Not one of the birth control methods in question induces abortions.
In an ideal world, there would 
be equality between genders. Equality is the goal of feminism. As the world stands, men hold a position of power and privilege over women. With this decision, the Roberts-led court made gender parity (which National Organiza-
tion for Women and other feminist 
groups are striving for) and equal-ity, a more distant dream.
Women and men interested in 
learning more about how to join the ﬁ  ght back against this unjust, anti-woman decision are welcome to join the Gainesville Area National Organization of Women. Gainesvil-

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man who pulled stun gun probes from 
his chest during a fight with an officer.
Preston Lopez Jackson III, 60, was 
arrested Monday afternoon and was 
charged for battery, resisting with vio-
lence and trespassing at the Food Max convenience store, located at 404 S. Main St., according to a police report.   
Police said the fight began after an 
employee didn’t want to serve Jack-son, who was reported to be drunk. Jackson argued with the employee while an officer was nearby, according 
to the report. The officer told Jackson 
he was being arrested for trespassing after multiple warnings.
“He had to be escorted out of the business,” GPD spokesman Ben Tobias wrote in an email. The officer tried to put handcuffs on Jackson in the park-ing lot, according to the report. How-
ever, Jackson pulled away and hit the 
officer repeatedly on the wrist.   
“Jackson ignored verbal commands 
to get on the ground and advanced with clenched fists saying he wanted to fight,” Tobias said.
The officer used his stun gun and 
hit Jackson’s chest with the probes, according to the report. Jackson then 
ripped the probes from his chest, ren-
dering the stun gun useless. Jackson then came at the officer again, which made the officer pull out his baton to hit him several times on the left leg and wrist, according the report.
Jackson made several threats to kill 
the officer, saying “This ain’t over.” Po-lice also said he normally carries a pis-
tol and would be looking for the officer 
when he gets out of jail.  Stun gun no match for 
Gainesville man’s chestSTATE

Swimmers stay aware: 
Sharks attacks may be on the 
rise this summer.
George Burgess, director of 
the Florida Program for Shark Research, said as more people enter the water and our popu-lation continues to rise, there are going to be higher chanc-es of humans encountering sharks.
“Every time we enter the 
sea, it’s a wilderness experi-ence,” Burgess said. “We enter the sea in an almost naked po-sition, and we need to remem-ber that when we go into the water we are visitors to that environment. We are not owed 100 percent safety.”
An increase in aquatic rec-
reational activities also con-tributes to the rise in attacks. Surfing and boogie boarding creates splashing and move-ments that are considered pro-
vocative to sharks.
Florida shark attacks are 
most often considered a “hit and run,” where a shark takes 
one bite and swims away. The No. 1 culprit for this type of at-tack is the Blacktip shark.
UF surf club president John 
Wilson said he recently spot-ted a Blacktip shark surfing in the same wave as his younger brother. Because this happens 
frequently, his family has de-
veloped hand signs to indicate 
when sharks are in the water.  
“We wave our right hand 
like a Seminole tomahawk,” 
Wilson said. “We (surfers) 
spend time in dirty water mak-
ing it difficult for sharks to identify what they are looking at. Many times, people have 
fallen off a wave and landed 
on a shark.”
Wilson suggests that surf-ers keep an eye out for schools 
of baitfish or birds flying over-
head, which are good indica-
tions that larger sharks and fish may be in the area.
Swimmers should also 
avoid murky waters and 
swimming at dawn or twi-light, Burgess said. If attacked 
by a shark, it’s best to get into 
a defensive position and fight 
back, hitting the shark on its nose, gills or poking its eye. Playing dead will not deter an 
aggressive shark.
In 2013, 23 people were bit-
ten by sharks in Florida, and 24 
more across the U.S., accord-ing to shark attack statistics by 
the Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History. Volusia County in 
East Central Florida has had 257 shark attacks since 1882.
“You are going into the 
sharks habitat,” Wilson said. 
“You need to be mindful of 
that.”More people, more shark attackstheAvenue

Former (for now) Dashboard 
Confessional frontman Chris 
Carrabba is appearing at 1982 Bar on July 24 with his latest project, 
a seven-person folk-punk outfit 
called Twin Forks. Just like Dash-
board Confessional, you’ll want to 
belt their songs as you drive with 
the windows down — but for dif-ferent reasons. Where Dashboard 
songs spoke of vulnerability 
edged with mid-2000s emo self-
consciousness, Twin Forks sheds those feelings in favor of folksy, 
uptempo good times. And yes, 
there’s even some whistling.
What are some of your favor-
ite places in South Florida?
“My No.1 favorite place in 
South Florida is the Lion & Eagle 
in Boca. We played there a lot, 
just impromptu — I’ll play there 
with myself or with a band. I like 
Lake Worth a lot, Propaganda. 
I do secret shows there on occa-
sion.”
What do you miss most about 
Florida when you’re away tour-ing or recording?
“I miss my friends, my family. 
I miss the beach something aw-
ful. It stresses me out; they don’t 
have beaches everywhere, it 
turns out. So I miss that. I’m not a 
lay-out-and-tan guy, but I like to 
go to the beach and walk around, 
play guitar, look at the water for a minute.”
Can you tell me more about 
how you’re feeling right now 
about working with a seven-
piece band versus just you and a guitar on stage?
“There’s just tons more stuff 
to react to. It’s sometimes only five, it’s sometimes four pieces, so that’s part of the fun: Not knowing who’s going to be avail-able for which tour and knowing 
which ways we can experiment to 
broaden the sound when there’s 
not as many people; knowing how 
to not overdo it when there are so 
many people. And I love that ev-
eryone’s a vocalist, so there’s tons 
of harmonies. It’s rewarding; It’s 
in the moment. You’re just lifted 
up into a euphoric place. That 
sounds real hippie-dippie, but it’s the truth.”
Does it make you want to 
stick with bands, or do you see yourself going back to solo work 
soon?
“I don’t know about soon, but 
I do see that as an inevitability. I’ll probably do a full-band Dash-
board run well before I do a solo 
run. Frankly, I miss the sound to 
hell and back.”
Is it easy slipping back into 
the Dashboard Confessional 
mindset, or have you changed 
so much as an artist that it feels 
surreal or different?
“I haven’t written any Dash-
board songs recently, but the ones I have have a certain undeniable 
characteristic that is unique to 
Dashboard. That said, slipping 
back into it onstage — even at Twin Forks shows, when some-
body calls out a Dashboard song, I’m happy to do it … and it is no 
trouble to get back to that place, 
because it all lives in the song.”
What songs are you covering 
lately?
“We just played with Jeff 
Tweedy from Wilco, so on the go, I’ve been playing a lot with 
Wilco. Jonathan said something to the band once that I wasn’t  
supposed to know about, but I think it’s funny: He said, ‘If you 
ever hear Chris listening to a song twice in a row, learn it. That 
means it’s going to just come out 
one day as a cover.’”
What’s it like playing with 
Jeff Tweedy? That’s really cool.
“Playing with (Tweedy) is like 
playing with the best band in the 
world. You see what they do, 
you try to understand how they 
got there and try to get yourself 
there. It’s inspiring in a useful way. Jeff’s tried everything and made every great choice already, so it helps—it’s like Cliff’s Notes. And the new Jeff Tweedy record 
is just phenomenal. Where they 
lay out, the amount of ornamen-
tation or lack thereof — every song is a lesson.” 
Dashboard came around the 
time that Myspace was the place 
for musicians to be, but so much 
has changed with music and so-
cial media since then. As some-
one who experienced both, do 
you miss the Myspace days? Or do you think Twitter is better?
“I don’t know which is better; 
they were both so useful. There’s this attempt, with Justin Timber-
lake buying Myspace, to make it more specifically music-driven. I 
don’t know if that’ll work or not, 
but it was the tool to use, just like 
Twitter or Facebook is the tool to 
use now. I have a particular loy-alty to Myspace, being friends 
with the guy who started it. But 
when it comes down to the rest 
of it, these are great tools to reach 
people you otherwise couldn’t 
reach. Now, that said, I feel like 
face-to-face interaction is much 
better.”

Beaches, Jeff Tweedy and Myspace: A Q&A with Twin Forks

You may not know the band 
Woman’s Hour, but you will soon. 
Its debut LP, “Conversations,” teases the early makings of a be-loved indie-pop band. 
The English quintet balances 
tragic lyricism with moody pro-duction and differentiates itself from similar bands with its pop-sensible hooks.
Bands like the XX and Beach 
House have seemingly mastered the dreamy aesthetics of indie pop, especially in their manipulations of female vocals. 
Woman’s Hour’s approach to 
the genre differentiates from those bands in the way its mellow lyrics juxtapose the bouncy choruses that carry them. 
Titular track “Conversations” 
has front woman, Fiona Burgess, delivering lyrics drenched in sad-ness with such aplomb you’ll al-most forget Burgess’ message of lost love.
The four-piece band efficiently 
balances its roles in stunning fash-ion. Guitarist William Burgess, Fiona’s brother, takes note of the haunting guitar chords heard from the band’s indie pop brethren and expands on them by crafting buoy-ant licks. 
“Conversations” also benefits 
from the production on part of producer Tom Morris. Morris em-ploys ambient synths and echoing kicks that add extra oomph in place of the band’s lack of a drummer.
Woman’s Hour’s debut ulti-mately adds a fresh sound to the growing tedium of the indie pop genre. 
A lot of potential exists between 
the Burgess’ sneakily soft crooning and the spacey noises which per-vade every track from the album. “Conversations” may not break much new ground but it lays the groundwork for a potentially mas-sive band.

The CNTRL-SPACE exhibit 
by Patrick Pagano, assistant in 
Digital Arts and Science and UF alumnus, is a new exhibit at the University Galleries that is a part 
of UF’s Creative B summer ac-
tivities.
On display until July 25, it 
includes three screens showing  images that change based on the user’s interaction with a device. The ﬁ  rst, VJ-LIVE, is constructed of abstract shapes and colors that change based on the music that 
is playing. It includes a device 
called a midi controller that re-acts to tapping, like a drum set for ﬁ  ngers.
“We are using programming 
and ﬁ  ne arts together to create new experiences,” Pagano said.
The second part of the exhibit 
was CNTRL-SPACE. It included 
an iPad with a program on it that 
would affect the abstract images projected onscreen. It’s actually an update of VJ-LIVE, Pagano said.
Pagano compared digital me-
dia with artwork. He said with a painting, you don’t get the op-portunity to redo it.
“With digital media we’re 
able to revisit works and revive it and refashion it and recode it into something new,” Pagano said.
The third part of the exhibit, 
uVISUAL, worked with smart-phones. Search terms that were typed into the website for uVI-SUAL would then be put into a collage with all the images from Tumblr that had that word or phrase tagged.
“It takes the Google search 
and puts it all together in a col-
lage,” Pagano said.
All of the pieces in the exhib-
its were created to be a changing 
piece of art that would be differ-ent for each visitor, Pagano said. He calls it participatory art.
“When they leave the gallery, 
they’ve left a new painting or a new picture for the next person,” 
he said.
“Someone’s actually making 
decisions on what your stuff’s 
going to look like,” Pagano said. “As soon as you give someone a slider or a button to press that af-fects your art— it’s a whole dif-ferent ballgame. It’s a different way of looking at artwork.”Artwork you can add to DEBORA LIMA

Tyler Eastridge might be a spor-
nosexual. 
At 6 feet and 210 pounds, he is a 
walking mass of fashion-conscious, sculpted muscle and an aspiring ﬁ  t-
ness model.    
“Spornosexual” describes the sec-
ond wave of metrosexuals, according 
to English journalist Mark Simpson, who coined the word metrosexual in 1994. 
They differ from their predeces-
sors because they are obsessed — not with clothes, but with what is beneath 
them.
All people know, or know of, a 
man who ﬁ  ts the bill. The spornosex-ual is vain — self-absorbed even. He 
fetishizes his body, and when he isn’t at the gym perfecting his physique, he’s showing it off on Instagram.The spornosexual man is unafraid to self-objectify, especially online.
Indeed, social media may be the 
force behind this new concept, said  Aaron Victoria, head teaching assis-tant of Human Sexuality and Culture, a UF anthropology course.
“Because of social media, males 
are constantly exposed to what other men look like, which creates a stan-dard. A biased one, because it’s not the guys without six packs posting 
pictures.”
Victoria said he thinks there are 
implications to labels and the media 
that inﬂ  uence them.“By creating these categories, it’s 
boxing people in. Now you have to be shredded, which is a really high standard to aspire to,” he said.
Eastridge, a 21-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology & kinesiology se-nior, represents that standard. He 
began working out his sophomore 
year of high school when he got a free gym membership through his job as a dishwasher at a restaurant.
“I started working out, and I 
haven’t looked back since,” he said.
Eastridge deviates from Simp-
son’s spornosexual model — chiseled body, dull mind — by clocking about 
20 hours of study time per week, but 
he ﬁ  ts the mold in all other ways.
Last month, he posed for ﬁ  tness 
photographer Michael A. Downs, and he’s currently gracing the photogra-pher’s website, allamericanguys.com, as one of ﬁ  ve “Boys of Summer.”
Eastridge also puts time and effort 
into dressing himself, even curating matching outﬁ  ts for when he hits the gym, which he calls “his sanctuary.”
“I’m interested in dressing well 
because I know that’s a representa-tion of myself,” he said. “That’s why everyone thinks I’m a douchebag.”
Unlike Eastridge, David Corrado, 
a 20-year-old UF telecommunication junior and personal trainer at UF Rec-Sports, keeps his body off display.
He participated in an amateur ﬁ  t-
ness competition organized by the National Physique Committee in April, but other than that, he said, showing off his hard-earned phy-sique makes him feel arrogant.
Corrado said photos of men post-
ed online are photoshopped, which could warp the average guy’s expec-tations of his own appearance. And although it’s not as frequently dis-cussed, he added, misrepresentation 
of beauty ideals is as much as a prob-
lem for men as it is for women.
“Guys also get their standards 
of beauty from movies, even porn. These unattainable goals could deﬁ  -nitely create self-esteem issues,” Cor-rado said.
Victoria said labels like sporno-
sexual can have similar effects.
“The cultural perceptions of what 
it means to be a man are constantly changing, and ‘spornosexual’ is a fas-cinating manifestation of that.”

When indie-rock giant Built to Spill decided 
to perform in Gainesville last October, it wanted an intimate, scaled-back show. So Pat Lavery, owner of local booking company Glory Days Presents, booked them at High Dive.
“That’s probably my favorite show we’ve 
had,” Lavery said. “It was really cool to have them in our building.”
Narrowing down a favorite High Dive show 
is no small feat. The venue, which celebrates its third anniversary this weekend, has a stay-ing power that’s owed to its mass appeal: Acts ranging from The Lemonheads to Aaron Carter to Surfer Blood to the Whitest Kids U’Know to Manchester Orchestra have appeared there in the past. 
It regularly hosts food truck rallies, stand-up 
acts, screenings and art shows. 
Lavery said the venue’s reputation for its 
high-quality sound system, simplistic setup and consistency has kept it thriving. 
“There’s no one that’s putting the care into 
sound and production that we are at High Dive,” Lavery said. “And there’s no one booking the amount of live music we are on a regular basis.”
The Southwest Second Av-
enue space, a medium-sized venue that holds several hun-
dred people, has seen a lot of 
turnover in the past few decades. In the 1990s, it 
was a club called the Covered Dish.
 In 2004, former coffee shop and music ven-
ue Common Grounds bought the space. When Common Grounds announced it was closing in 2011, Lavery organized a new group of owners to purchase the club and keep it open.
“I’ve been playing in that room for 20 years,” 
said Chris Wollard of Chris Wollard & the Ship Thieves. “It’s excellent. Gainesville’s just a little town, and (High Dive’s) got everything we need. That’s why we keep playing there. It’s just 
a nice, comfortable place.” 
Chris Wollard & the Ship Thieves will per-
form at High Dive alongside Ones to Blame, 
Gris Gris Boys and Made Ready as part of the venue’s third-anniversary weekend.

The title of a recipe gives the ﬁ  rst 
impression of the dish and the au-
thor. Recipe titles are printed in spe-cial, large type, memorable as the of-ﬁ  cial label. The title can be simply a 
word, “Oatmeal,” a more elaborate 
phrase, “Bountiful Blueberry Pie with Spiced Whipped Cream,” or almost a paragraph, a format more typical of earlier recipe titles. One from 1608: “To Make a Walnut, That When you Cracke It, You Shall Find Biskets, and Carrawayes in It, Or a Prettie Posey Written.” 
Recipe titles vary in the way 
the dish is described. Recipes like 
“Chocolate Ice Cream” get straight 
to the point, highlighting the main components of the dish. Others in-clude the cooking method, such as “Stir-fried rice.” Some refer to loca-tions, which lend themselves to au-thenticity, or conjure up thoughts of an exotic locale. Some recipes go as far as promoting that they’re the “Best Ever Buttermilk Pancakes,” and on the opposite side of the spec-trum, recipe titles can be self-dep-
recating: “Ugly but Good Hazelnut 
Cookies.”
Some titles credit the creator 
(“Bubba’s Gumbo”) as a way to remember the person. It also adds credibility to the dish if the person is known for his or her culinary skills. The personality of the author may be indicated, such as 
humor (“Hokey 
Pokey”) and creativity (“Meatzza”).
A good, unique title can make the 
recipe stand out among the rest and 
be selected and ultimately cooked or baked from. Whether the recipe in-trigues, puzzles or amuses, the title makes the prospective recipe reader want to know more. Titles may be a play on words: For instance, “Meatz-za” – what is it? (A meat-based pizza dish sans the crust.) 
Thus, a recipe title is a signpost of 
information of both the dish and the author. The best ones are distinctive and memorable and keep in mind the recipe’s promise to readers.

Among apps that allow you to rate friends 
and strangers, there is now one that enables 
coworkers to rate their fellow colleagues. 
CEO and founder Marc Cenedella created 
“Knozen” to bring personality to the Internet 
by allowing co-workers to register for an app 
that lets them answer questions about each other, according to the Knozen website.
Bruce Floyd, social media manager for the 
University Athletic Association, said it’s in-triguing because unlike LinkedIn, where you can endorse people for their skills, here you assess people’s personality traits.
This mobile app, which is currently avail-
able on the iTunes App Store, starts by asking users to input their names and work email ad-dresses upon sign-up. Knozen then veriﬁ  es the employees by sending a conﬁ  rmation email.
Once at least seven employees from the 
same company register, the rating begins.
The app works by asking questions such 
as, “Who is more likely to leave work early for a date?” Then, it gives you an option to anony-
mously choose between two participating em-
ployees.
After the voting begins, people can view 
their ratings, their colleagues’ ratings and peo-ple’s ratings from other companies. Based on the answers to the questions, the app identiﬁ  es who your co-workers think is more organized, more trusting or sympathetic.
Andrew Selepak, the UF director for the 
Master of Arts in Mass Communications and social media specialist, said he thinks the app can cause unnecessary drama at work. While the voting claims to be anonymous, 
it can’t be much of a mystery because with a seven-person minimum, you have to encour-age people to participate. Therefore, you have 
an idea of who’s involved, he said.
His main concern is that 
in end, people aren’t being rated on what they actually do at work, but how others judge them.
“It’s like, Let’s-Bring-
High-School-To-Work Day,” he said.
Similar to Selepak’s opinion, Floyd said 
although he thinks it’s an interesting concept, any of the questions can be misconstrued de-
pending on the person.
“For example, if you pride yourself in be-
ing organized, and your peers don’t see you that way, it can affect how you see yourself,” 
Floyd said.
He explained that it’s like when you send 
a harmless email out and then get a response saying it was offensive.   
“I believe this app is cheeky, like a lot of 
these other dating type of apps,” said Norman 
Galang, a 21-year-old journalism major at UF.   
He said he thinks it could lead to potential 
tension in the workplace if a person decides to 
indirectly patronize another co-worker. 
Currently, the app holds two-and-a-half 
out of ﬁ  ve stars in the App Store. The only complaint from users is that it strictly requires a company email address, which some people are not allowed to provide for personal use, 
according to reviews. Knozen is scheduled to 
be released into the Android market within a few months.Know what your co-workers really think of you with ‘Knozen’THURSDAY, JULY 17, 2014

Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
HOOVER, Ala. — During the 
2013 Southeastern Conference Me-
dia Days, details about the SEC 
Network were vague. 
One year later, there is a concrete 
direction the network is headed 
with four national cable and satel-
lite distributors signed on to carry 
it during the Aug. 14 launch — in-cluding Cox Communications. 
With four weeks left before 
launch, Justin Connolly, senior vice 
president of the network, spoke 
Wednesday about multiple aspects pertaining to the network, giv-ing further clarity to what you’ll 
see when you turn on the TV next 
month.
In its infancy, there will be kinks 
to work out, one of which is how the network will cover situations 
such as breaking news. 
It’s a network part-owned by 
ESPN — the exact ownership stake 
is not known — and part-owned by 
the conference. 
There will be times during its 
first season that major news will 
break. The nature of the level of exposure the conference has and the reverence people have for their 
schools in this corner of the country 
leads to major scandals needing to be covered 24/7.
Cam Newton’s father allegedly 
taking money from Mississippi 
State, Johnny Manziel’s autograph 
scandal and Nick Saban’s flirtation with Texas are examples of major stories the network will have to 
cover and that’s only one sport. 
The question is that of journalis-
tic identity. Will the network be just 
a public relations mouthpiece for ESPN and the conference, or will 
it exhibit “Outside the Lines” level 
investigative prowess?
“We spent a lot of time talking 
about that and as I’ve said before we’re not going to have the news infrastructure that ESPN has,” Con-nolly said. 
“We’re not going do a whole lot 
of investigative journalism but we are going to report when something happens and let fans know. I think that’s critical in order to maintain 
editorial integrity and credibility 
with fans out there.”
The talent on the network has 
been finalized including former Florida football players Jesse Palm-er and Tim Tebow. Palmer will be a color analyst in the play-by-play 
booth and Tebow will primarily 
be an analyst on the “SEC Nation” pregame show which will travel ev-ery week to the biggest game of the Saturday slate.
“We’ve seen when we bring him 
on site just the level of fan affinity and overage and the following he has and the ability to bring that to 
our network is something special,” 
Connolly said. “So we’re excited about that.”
The programming has been fi-
nalized as well. 
The network will premiere 10 
new “SEC Storied” documentary style films each year, including one 
on former Florida coach Steve Spur-
rier on Aug. 27.
Radio host Paul Finebaum will 
have a daily slot in which his show 
will be simulcast and there will be a 
daily SportsCenter-like show called “SEC Now.” “SEC in 60” will pro-vide an enhanced highlight pack-age for the previous week’s football games and “Film Room” will show-case a different SEC head coach breaking down game tape every 
Wednesday night.
Combined with its online 
streaming via the WatchESPN app, 
the SEC Network promises to make 
550 live events available in the first 
year after launch — that includes every conference baseball, softball, men’s or women’s basketball game as well as every SEC gymnastics 
meet.
In order to meet that goal, 
broadcast infrastructure at every 
school had to be improved — some more than others. As far as UF is concerned, the university found it-self in the good graces of the ESPN brass when it came to facility in-
spection.
“They were ready to go because 
they already have a local broadcast 
network there,” Connolly said. 
“Great facilities, so there it was just 
interesting in terms of upgrades here and there, in terms of event production. But they were one of the campuses that were pretty far 
along.”
There is much more negotiation 
left to do with distributors espe-
cially with big fish like Comcast, DirecTV, Bright House and Time Warner yet to sign on. Not every-one will be able to watch the net-work when they want, and the 
11th hour nature of when deals are 
struck understandably has some fans sweating. 
The boss is not, though.
“I’d say we’re confident about 
the conversation and our confi-
dence is really based on the de-mand that’s out there among SEC fans,” Connolly said. “You go out 
there and you just see the level of 
passion among this fanbase. I think it’s unrivaled so we’re confident based on that.”

As part of the Alligator Awards recognizing 
the best in UF athletics during the 2013-14 sea-
son, staff writers Jordan McPherson and Eden 
Otero will debate two of the four nominees for 
best freshman. Vote for the winner online at al-ligatorSports.org.Jordan: Every year, one team sees a 
freshman come from nowhere to lead his team to success.
This year, that freshman hands-down is 
Logan Shore.
In his first season with Florida baseball, 
the right-handed pitcher posted a 2.16 ERA and led the squad with 15 starts, 95.2 in-nings pitched, 68 strikeouts and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 3.4:1.
After just three appearances totaling 
13 frames, coach Kevin O’Sullivan saw 
enough to name Shore the team’s Friday-
night starter, and the freshman responded by going 7-1 in Southeastern Conference play with a 2.08 ERA while holding oppo-nents to a measly .234 batting clip.Plus he hails from the awesomely named 
town of Coon Rapids, Minn. What more could you want?
Eden: I don’t know, Jordan. Shore is a 
great player, but I’m going to have to say that soccer’s Savannah Jordan had the bet-ter year. 
While soccer hasn’t really been at the Combining youth and experience: Who was UF’s top freshman?

HOOVER, Ala. – The College Football 
Playoff will ofﬁ  cially replace the Bowl 
Championship Series for the 2014-2015 college football postseason, and the pro-gram’s executive director had a chance 
on Wednesday to wow the public with a 
simple and efﬁ  cient presentation of the in-coming system.
Instead, we’re all just a little bit more 
confused.
Bill Hancock, who’s defended the BCS 
since November 2009 as its executive di-rector, presented the new College Football Playoff format to more than 1,000 journal-
ists at the Southeastern Conference Media 
Days and stumbled mightily through most of it.
“Uh, timeout,” he said when playing 
out the College Football Playoff formula on the ﬁ  nal rankings of years past. “I did that wrong.”
Hancock recreated what the postsea-
son would have looked like in 2006, 2011 
and 2012 if the College Football Playoff 
was implemented, which may have been a useful tool to clearly differentiate between this system and the BCS.
Unfortunately, 
the 62-year-old former newspaper editor did not re-hearse the presen-tation and made the format appear 
more complicated 
than it should have been.
“I don’t know if this will work,” he 
muttered when ﬁ  lling out the hypothetical 
bowl games.
Hancock regularly ﬂ  ubbed the names 
of conferences (calling them the Big 8 and the Pac-10), asked the media not to tweet out his gaffes (good one) and failed in his 
overall goal: Simplify the College Football 
Playoff method to the public.
The breakdown of hypothetical match-
ups was unrehearsed and chaotic, illustrat-ing both the ill-preparedness of Hancock and the inefﬁ  ciency of the College Football Playoff to easily translate to the average football fan.
The BCS was so widely criticized be-
cause its selection process seemed random at times, infuriating fanbases and schools across the nation. The sport’s new post-season method was supposed to be clean, smooth and straightforward, but Hancock did a piss-poor job relaying any of that to his audience.
After his hour-long commercial, Han-
cock stepped out of the main ballroom in the Hyatt Regency Birmingham to do a more personal Q&A with the media. It is 
clear the man is incredibly nice and polite, 
but it is even clearer that he will need to practice his interactions with reporters be-fore attempting any more presentations at conference media days.
Hancock dodged questions about pos-
sibly expanding to eight or 16 teams, re-peating that the College Football Playoff has a 12-year contract with the conferences 
to remain at four teams. We know there’s 
a 12-year agreement, Bill, but how about telling us why the committee immediately took an eight or 16-team possibility “off the table”?
When the subject of affordable ticket 
prices came up for fans who want to see the conference championship, semiﬁ  nal and national title, his response was, “We’re 
going to have to keep our eye on that.”
What the hell does that mean? Just give it to me straight. The College Football 
Playoff was implemented as a moneymak-ing system for the conferences and the schools, right?
“There will be more money in this for 
everyone,” he said. “But the playoff wasn’t done for the money.”
Give me a break.According to USA TODAY, the ﬁ  ve 
power conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, SEC) will draw a baseline amount of about $50 million during the ﬁ  rst year of the College Football Playoff contract, which doubles their earnings from 2013 when the BCS was still in place.
When it comes down to it, college foot-
ball has become a business. I understand that. It’s a reality we all need to accept.
However, can we stop dealing with in-
competence on the actual football side of things? Bill, clear up the issues with the College Football Playoffs, be honest in your answers and at least do your best to pretend that this is for the fans.
I don’t care how much money Hancock 
and the schools rake in, but please just de-liver a simple method to crown a college 
football champion.
Is that too much to ask?

College Football Playoff unclear after poor media day presentation

Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
HOOVER, Ala. — AlligatorSports continues 
its Gators football position breakdown by looking 
at the safety position.
Florida’s safety corps lost a lot of valuable 
talent following the 2013 season, as Jaylen Watkins declared for the 2014 NFL Draft and Cody Riggs announced he would transfer to 
play at Notre Dame for his ﬁ  fth year of eligi-
bility. Both Watkins and Riggs were the units’ primary starters last season.
Behind Riggs and Watkins last year were redshirt sophomore Marcus Maye and senior Jabari Gorman. Gorman is the more experi-enced of the two — playing in every game in 2013 and 37 games throughout his career. 
Last season, the Miami native was sixth on 
the team with 48 total tackles. Gorman, given his experience, should start at strong safety this fall. 
As a senior, he’ll be the leader of a young 
group of safeties.
Maye was the starting safety at the be-
ginning of last season, but Watkins took his spot as he moved from corner to safety. Hav-ing the starting job and then being replaced 
by Watkins last year will help Maye mature 
heading into the 2014 season.
The winner of the free 
safety spot however could 
likely go to sophomore 
Keanu Neal.
Neal’s action was most-
ly limited to special teams last season, but the Bush-
nell, Fla., native is primed to have a breakout year. 
In his junior year at 
South Sumter High, he had more than 151 
tackles and added four interceptions.
There are a few young players who could come in and contribute early at the position, including redshirt freshman Marcell Harris. 
Harris came in as the No. 8 ranked safety 
in the 2013 recruiting class, but a foot injury 
he suffered in high school kept lingering long 
enough to give him a redshirt last year. 
He had a productive spring, but has yet to 
be truly tested at the collegiate level. He has 
the talent to have a breakout year if he can stay healthy. 
Redshirt freshman Nick Washington saw 
the ﬁ  eld for the ﬁ  rst time in spring, as a shoul-der injury earned him a redshirt in 2013. He had an interception in the spring game. 
He came in as the No. 16 ranked safety in 
the 2013 class.Gorman provides experience for youthful safety group
Shore, Jordan both national freshmen of the year in respective sports
forefront of Florida fans’ minds now for a couple months, I think it’s safe to say that if Florida soc-
cer fans took anything from the 
season it’s that coach Becky Bur-leigh recruited a powerhouse of a player. 
Jordan started in Florida’s sea-
son opener against Florida Gulf Coast and put down two goals. 
Her ﬁ  rst appearance EVER. One game later, she got her 
ﬁ  rst hat-trick in collegiate play. So basically, Jordan grabbed ﬁ  ve goals for the season in the ﬁ  rst two games of 2013. 
By the end of the season she 
raked in 22 goals — surpassing US Women’s National Team star Abby Wambach’s single season freshman record of 19 — and 47 
points, which is the most by a UF 
player since Wambach notched 76 in her ﬁ  nal year in a Gators’ uni-form.
Can I get an amen?Jordan: There’s no way to deny 
that Jordan had an outstanding season. 
The phenom forward from 
Fayetteville, Ga., had double-goal performance in ﬁ  ve games outside of her ﬁ  ve-goal opening weekend. 
She was an absolute monster — 
when not facing the top competi-tion. 
How many of those seven 
contests were against opponents ranked in the top 25? Zero. None. Zilch.
In fact, Jordan posted just three 
goals and one assist in Florida’s 
ﬁ  ve matches against ranked oppo-
nents — not necessarily top-notch numbers.
Shore, on the other hand, 
thrived against the tougher crowds. Four of his league-best-ty-ing seven SEC wins came against ranked opponents — LSU, Ken-tucky, Alabama and Vanderbilt.His stats through those four 
games? A .067 ERA over 29 in-
nings of work with 19 strikeouts 
against just six walks.
That’s performing in the clutch 
right there from Perfect Game’s 
National Freshman of the Year.
Eden: Ok, ok. You’ve got me 
on ranked teams. 
Shore is clearly a beast of a 
player and has lived up to the challenge against ranked oppo-
nents. 
But to Jordan’s defense, Florida 
faced its ranked opponents late in 
the season and at that point Flori-
da was facing a myriad of injuries — everything from concussions to torn ACL’s (Havana Solaun got the short end of the stick on that one) — and opponents had begun to deconstruct Florida’s defense at 
that point, doubling and even tri-
pling pressure on the freshman. 
Jordan’s shortcomings at the 
end of the season were a result of 
not being able to get out from un-
der the pressure. 
However, she managed to 
push through it and complete the season with accolades like 2013 
National Rookie of the Year, 2013 
All-SEC First Team and is now playing (and making game-win-ning shots) for the US Under-20 
Women’s National Team. 
It’s easy to say she didn’t per-
form well against ranked oppo-
nents, but there are more pieces to that puzzle than Jordan just not performing well.
Jordan: While Jordan has 
found success with the U20 team, that doesn’t really help her case.
This Alligator Award is about 
how well the freshmen performed 
during — not after — their sea-
son.
So while Jordan scored a goal 
in practically every appearance since playing her ﬁ  rst national-
