Steve McClain marched down to the po-
dium.
Will Muschamp lingered.
One, the University of Florida’s senior as-
sociate athletics director, has a long enough 
title to suggest that he has done this a time 
or two.
The other coaches football.Fitted in glasses, a Gator emblazoned but-
ton-down and a crisply ironed pair of khakis, the football coach was out of his element.
Business casual is not Will Muschamp.McClain thanked the media for its patience 
(all but a clever guise worn by the reporters 
to conceal their growing impatience) and 
stood tall as he recited his 19-second opening statement.
His conﬁ  dence gushed. He may not have 
wanted to be put in this scenario, but he was tackling it head on like Mike Taylor on an A-gap blitz.
The lights were on, and so was McClain.“We didn’t ﬁ  gure it was appropriate to 
stand up here Monday and talk about foot-ball,” McClain said scanning the room, lock-ing eyes with nearly every journalist. “I know only 48 hours has passed, and I respect that you have a job to do and have some questions for coach, so we’ll turn it over to him.”
Muschamp ﬁ  rst adjusted the mike. Even 
at 6-feet tall, he’s a much bigger man than McClain. But on Wednesday morning, he’d rather be small, hidden away from the spot-light that he never asked for.
The room was spacious enough to hold 
more than a dozen writers along with a crowded cackle of cameramen. But to Mus-champ, it must have felt so cramped that he would need to step outside just to change his mind.
A somber coach “Boom” rested on the 
pulpit. Muschamp had a cross to bear that wasn’t his own but instead a player’s. The 
weight grew heavy.
“To reiterate what Steve said, sorry to in-
convenience you guys, but with the situation 
Monday and the seriousness of it, I felt like it was a little insensitive to have a football press conference. I think it is today, too,” Mus-champ said from the crease of his mouth.
His head drooped, his voice lowered.“But we’ve got to move forward.”
In a little more than 25 minutes, Mus-
champ uttered the phrase “move forward” 
on ﬁ  ve different occasions. “Step forward” was mentioned once more.
Forward? The man who was destined to 
take Florida forward is now in the shadows. From star to suspect, Treon Harris still has an undecided role in this Greek tragedy.
But even so, it’s not Harris’ voice that will 
speak the loudest when the case closes to an end.
“Mighty is the murmur of a crowd,” said 
Agamemnon, the tragic hero in his own myth.
The King of Argos was slain upon his re-
turn home. Treon Harris is hoping for better 
results.
■   ■   ■
“He is not guilty of a crime and he did 
not mistreat this young lady in any way that 
night.”
Huntley Johnson is doing his best to save 
his client’s future, one that shone so bright that every school in the Sunshine State want-
ed a piece. 
Harris had his pick of the litter: Florida, 
Florida State, Miami. 
All three programs had national titles to 
boast to the 18-year-old kid who had already 
had one of his own from his time with Booker T. Washington High.
All three were selling in a buyer’s market. 
Harris was a winner and acted like one.
First was Florida State.Harris committed to Jimbo Fisher’s team 
before entering his senior year.
“Florida State’s a great school,” he said 
while attending the Jimbo Fisher Football Camp in July 2013.
He speaks rhythmically. His cadence, 
bouncing from word to word in staccato fash-ion, has a hypnotizing effect.
Harris knows you’re waiting, and he 
knows you’ll stick around to hear what’s coming next.
“Like I told you — for the ranking — it sells itself — great academics — players in the NFL every year — winning program,” Harris said to SB Nation.
Fisher initially drew Harris to Tallahas-
see because of his success with past quarter-backs. 
Christian Ponder and E.J. Manuel had both 
risen out of Fisher’s system and were drafted into the NFL, Harris’ end goal.
If anyone were to help Harris make that 
next leap, it would be Fisher. 
Until it wasn’t.“‘I know he’s committed to us right now, 
but I understand that schools are going to come after him late in the game, and my job 
is to just ﬁ  ght them off,’” said Tim Harris Jr., 
who recalled Fisher’s foreshadowing mes-sage.
“(Fisher) was hoping that Treon stayed a 
secret for him throughout the whole process, but he knew there was going to come a time where he’s going to have to ﬁ  ght for him.”
On National Signing Day, Fisher ofﬁ  cially 
lost the ﬁ  ght. Muschamp, the proud victor.
Maybe it was the addition of offensive 
coordinator Kurt Roper that swayed Harris’ decision. Maybe it was the lore of possibly re-forming a once rich program back into what it had been.
Or maybe it was the fact that a certain 
Jameis Winston cemented his role as FSU’s starting quarterback, automatically relegat-ing Harris to the bench or even a redshirt 
campaign in Tallahassee.
But now separated by more than 100 miles, 
Harris and Winston are still but a breath apart 
for all the wrong reasons.
Winston won a Heisman and the ﬁ  nal BCS 
National Championship under the cloud of a sexual assault investigation while FSU gave its quarterback “due process.” The Semi-noles’ star was never charged and therefore 
never gave up the pads.
Harris won’t get the same treatment. 
The climate surrounding athletics and vio-
lence toward women has heated up as of late considering the Ray Rice, Greg Hardy and Ray McDonald scandals.
No matter the reality of what happened 
in that Springs dorm Sunday morning, UF President Bernie Machen couldn’t allow this 
investigation to idle while Harris continued 
to don the Orange and Blue.
Not with UF’s very own notorious assault-
er still on the lam, preying on female students on what is supposed to be their safe haven: campus.
It was time for Machen to lay down the 
hammer, and Harris — innocent or guilty — was the nail.
■   ■   ■
In the midst of all this is a simple game of 
football.
No practices have been moved; no staff 
meetings have been canceled. Florida’s matchup with LSU on Saturday is still hap-pening at 7:30 p.m. inside Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
Just as scheduled.In a world that feeds off the chaotic rumble 
that is unpredictability, Muschamp must en-joy the order and the organization that comes with Saturday night football.
This he has a game plan for. This he has a 
clock, which will expire after 60 minutes ev-ery time. This he doesn’t have to wear loafers to.
The Tigers may not be the doormat the 
Gators could use at a time like this, but they still beat the hell out of loafers.
So Muschamp once again leans on his 
old battling buddy, Jeff Driskel. The starting quarterback gig falls right back into Driskel’s lap along with all the pressure that comes with it.
The situation isn’t ideal for Florida, but it 
is comfortable.
Football players are creatures of habit. 
They run the same drills, they practice the same plays, they work out the same muscles with the same equipment at the same time every day.
Win or lose, Saturday will bring the play-
ers back to their favorite habit of all: strap-ping on a helmet and getting back to black-and-blue football.
To Muschamp, it’s all part of taking the 
next step.
Moving forward.KICKOFF

In a three-page statement released Thurs-
day morning, Treon Harris’ Gainesville-based 
attorney Huntley Johnson aimed to clarify details surrounding his client’s sexual battery investigation, as well as give his client’s side of the story backed by witness testimony.
Johnson conﬁ  rmed that Harris is on inter-
im University suspension and had to appeal in order to be able to take his online classes.
He is not allowed on campus at this time.Part of Johnson’s claim is to dispel the idea 
that the alleged victim did not know Harris prior to the night of Oct. 5.“Our client and the al-
leged victim knew each oth-er to the extent that they had each other’s cellphone num-bers and had previously spent time together of their own accord for the purpose 
of socializing together,” the 
statement reads.
The statement also re-
futes earlier information told to the Alligator by a source that the alleged interaction took 
place in Harris’ room. Johnson said in the statement that Harris had never been inside the alleged victim’s room.
According to the statement, the alleged vic-
tim initiated things by sending Harris text mes-sages while he was still in the locker room in Knoxville, Tennessee, following Florida’s 10-9 
victory. When the team arrived in Gainesville, 
the contact continued between the two.Treon Harris’ lawyer releases statement of incident

Marion Rose Harvey lost her life Wednesday 
night after she was rear-ended while driving her 
scooter on 34th Street.
The 51-year-old Gainesville woman was 
stopped in northbound trafﬁ  c just over a hill near the 34th Street Wall before a Toyota Camry, driven by Rachel Louise Crow, 31, hit her from 
behind, Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer 
Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
The Camry pushed Harvey into a GMC Sierra 
pickup truck, driven by Jared Waite Jerrels, 20, which was stopped in front of her.
Harvey still had a pulse when ofﬁ  cers arrived, 
Tobias said. She was given CPR, but because she sustained traumatic injuries, Harvey was later pronounced dead in the emergency room. 
Following the accident, trafﬁ  c on Southwest 
34th Street came to a standstill. The road was closed off between Southwest Second Avenue and Radio Road for a few hours as patrol cars surrounded the scene. 
The street reopened again at about 10:30 p.m.Tobias said neither alcohol nor speeding ap-
peared to be involved. 
So far this year, there have been 52 scooter 
crashes in Gainesville, he said, and the major-ity were during the day. There were a total of 95 scooter crashes in 2012, and last year, there were 68. 
Harvey’s death was the fourth fatal scooter 
accident since 2008.Details of fatal

When Kathy Butler and Scooby 
ﬁ  rst locked eyes, Butler knew it was 
meant to be. 
“He was small, but he was feisty,” 
Butler, 47, said.
From the moment she walked into 
Alachua County Animal Services’ shelter during a tour this summer, she fell in love with the golden yel-low, 15-pound Shih Tzu and Chihua-
hua mix.
Butler would soon join families 
across the state who were drawn 
to the Gainesville shelter to adopt, thanks to its participation in the an-nual ASPCA Rachael Ray $100K Chal-lenge, a three-month contest between shelters nationwide to ﬁ  nd homes for as many pets as possible. 
Alachua County Animal Servic-es won second place in its division against nine other similarly sized shelters. The total prize of $20,000 
will go toward supporting animal 
welfare, said the shelter’s director, Vernon Sawyer.
It was the ﬁ  rst time the local shel-
ter was invited to participate in the competition, and it was ready to up the ante. 
“We did more than we’ve ever 
done before,” Sawyer said. “We were Puppy love in Alachua County wins prizeSays he, victim were happy

For the next month, the NASA director of 
Public Affairs will visit UF and share her exper-
tise with students.
Lisa Malone has worked with NASA for 
more than 25 years, dealing with social media, 
news, communication and web content. Malone 
will now work under the Bob Graham Center for Public Service as the third Knight Fellow-in-Residence.
The Knight Fellow-in-Residence program is a 
three-year program funded by a $3 million grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Founda-tion. The program allows the Graham Center to invite leaders to work with faculty and students, wrote Shelby Taylor, communications director for the center, in an email.
Malone will meet with faculty and staff in the 
College of Journalism and Communications and guest lecture in some of the classes in the college, as well as teach Public Relations Strategy with professor Juan-Carlos Molleda.
“She brings great knowledge and expertise to 
the university,” Molleda said.
He said that Malone will be giving students 
feedback and helping students with career ad-
vising in the college’s advising ofﬁ  ce.
“She’s bringing a wealth of experience into 
the hands of students,” Molleda said.
Malone will meet with various clubs, such as 
the Society of Women Engineers and the Public 
Relations Student Society of America.

A UF researcher has won a prestigious 
award for her strawberry monitoring system. 
Natalia Peres, a UF associate professor of 
plant pathology, developed the Strawberry 
Advisory System, which uses a web tool where 
growers can log in to a website and sign up for 
email or text alerts.Growers input their location’s weather data 
and the frequency of their fungicide applica-tions in the past. The system then shows the 
risk level of strawberry crop diseases around 
Florida and recommendations on how often growers should spray fungicide.
For her work, Peres won the Lee M. 
Hutchins Award from the American Phyto-pathological Society in August.
“Helping the growers is the biggest award,” she said.
According to the Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences, Peres’ Strawberry Advi-sory System has been tested in several states 
and is expected to be used by growers in South 
Carolina this spring.
“The beneﬁ  ts of such a tool is that growers 
will be able to apply fungicides only when con-ditions are favorable for disease development, thus reducing the number of applications 
and production costs without compromising 
disease control,” Peres said in her published ﬁ  ndings.
Seth Poppell, a UF animal sciences senior, 
said his brother’s farm had problems with fungi on strawberries last year.
“The problem went back to the nurseries,” 
said Poppell, 21. 
Peres’ Strawberry Advisory System, which 
focuses on preventing diseases before they oc-cur, will soon expand to include nurseries in addition to ﬁ  elds. UF professor  wins award for strawberry monitoring system

In the midst of Hispanic Heri-
tage Month, UF’s celebrations 
include more than just food and music. 
Miami-Dade County School 
Board members voted Tuesday to 
create a program that would make 
the month focus more on Hispanic contributions to society. Hispanic student organizations at UF have been highlighting Hispanic contri-butions throughout the month.The Hispanic Heritage Month 
executive board works hard every year to create a holistic calendar of 
events, said Olivia Garcia, the di-
rector of UF’s Institute of Hispan-ic-Latino Cultures.
“There is an event each day for 
the month, which means I’m ex-hausted,” she said.
As part of the month, Toño 
Rosario will be performing to-night in the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts.  A carnival is 
planned for Sunday and a closing ceremony will be held Tuesday before the month ends Oct. 14. 
UF’s Hispanic Heritage Month 
is the largest student-run Hispan-
ic heritage month in the country, 
Garcia said.
This year, spoken word art-
ist Michael Reyes was the guest speaker at the Hispanic Heritage Month opening ceremony.
“People don’t understand that 
there isn’t one single deﬁ  nition of what being Latino means,” said

� BUT IT WAS ONLY ON A DEATH CERTIFI-
CATE. 
LAURA VAZQUEZ 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Amid UF’s Pride History Week, Florida issued 
its ﬁ  rst legal recognition of a same-sex marriage.
Arlene Goldberg and Carol Goldwasser had 
been together for 47 years and married in New 
York. But when Goldwasser died, she was not list-
ed as Goldberg’s wife on her death certiﬁ  cate. 
After a long legal battle, the certiﬁ  cate was 
changed and issued to Goldberg Wednesday, said 
Equality Florida spokeswoman Sharon Kersten.
Kersten said U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle ruled that Florida’s ban on marriage equal-ity was unconstitutional, and in August, he ordered the state to issue a new death certiﬁ  cate for Gold-wasser stating that the couple was in fact married.
“I think that the ﬁ  rst recognized same-sex mar-
riage in Florida is deﬁ  nitely a step in the right di-
rection,” said Damian Gonzalez, UF Pride Student 
Union internal vice president.
UF Pride History Week started Monday and

After 14 years, SoulFest is bringing some 
change to its multicultural talent show.  
SoulFest, the homecoming week kickoff 
event, was previously held at the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center. The mashup of student talent acts will now take place at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Sunday. Doors will open at 4:30 p.m. for tabling, and free food will be served at 5 p.m. The show will start at 6:30 p.m.
SoulFest director William Smith, 21, said 
new acts such as UF Danza and FACES Modeling Troupe will perform at the event for the ﬁ  rst time.
The SoulFest committee chose 13 partici-
pants to showcase, and the talent show win-ner will perform at Gator Growl.Smith, a recreation and event manag-
ment senior, said the committee contributed 
about $7,000 for this year’s event.
The committee also added new food op-
tions to the evening, including caribbean 
food, The Coop and Mi Apá Latin Café.
“The theme of SoulFest is Soul Train: 
Memories and melodies,” UF event produc-
er Austin Jurado, a 21-year-old industrial and systems engineering senior, said. “We 
are very excited.”Multicultural talent show introduces changes after 14 years
The shelter doubled the number of rescues, returns it saw last year

Gator Domino’s put the shel-
ter’s cry for adopters on its boxes, 
and sponsors, radio stations and fast-food restaurants, including 
Burger King and Sonic, helped 
spread the word.Sawyer said people from ev-
ery coast of Florida came in to adopt, from Miami Lakes to Tal-lahassee.
In total, 1,488 animals found 
homes between June and August, either through adoption or being returned to owners — 706 more than last summer.
“This was the largest event we’ve ever participated in,” Saw-yer said. “Any time that we can save more animals by returning them to the owner or adopting 
them out to their forever homes, 
that’s what we are about.” 
The shelter provides a tempo-
rary home for primarily dogs and cats. Smaller pets, such as ham-sters, guinea pigs and ferrets, are sometimes available for adop-tion. The shelter ensures that pets ﬁ  t into the family dynamic they are being adopted into. 
When Butler brought her fam-
ily back to the shelter to adopt Scooby, her husband, 103.7 the Gator radio personality JJ Thom-as, and two kids — 10-year-old Brock and 13-year-old Kyli — were ready to welcome him.
Scooby, who was named after 
the alpha dog of cartoons, quick-ly learned to get along with the 
family’s two other pets: pug duo 
Moose and Baxter.
“It feels so rewarding that he’s 
here,” Kathy Butler said. “The best dogs come from animal shel-ters.”

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is known primarily for 
two things: his extreme conservatism — though he might prefer the term “judicial restraint” — and his tendency to 
make bizarre and controversial statements about the Consti-tution. Scalia struck again this week when, during a speech at 
Colorado Christian University, he asserted that the U.S. govern-
ment can “favor religion over non-religion.” Perhaps someone should direct Scalia to Article 6 of the Constitution, which for-bids any “religious test” for public ofﬁ  ce. There’s also that pesky First Amendment, which makes sure Congress passes no law law favoring religion. We’re giving a have-you-ever-even-read-
the-Constitution? DART to Antonin Scalia. 
The news out of the Supreme Court wasn’t all bad this week. 
On Monday, the nation’s highest court declined to hear appeals 
of cases from the state level that declared marriage equality bans 
unconstitutional. By letting these rulings stand, the Supreme Court indirectly legalized marriage equality in ﬁ  ve states: In-diana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. This series of events brings the total number of states with legalized mar-riage equality to 24 — plus the District of Columbia. That num-ber could increase to as much as 30 as the implications of the Court’s decision take effect at the state level. Despite howls from conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,  about the Supreme 
Court’s “judicial activism” — pretty strange considering the 
Court actually opted not to do anything — this week’s events are a clear sign that nationally legalized gay marriage is a ques-tion of when, not if. A spread-the-love-around LAUREL to the 
Supreme Court. 
Warren Buffett, the world’s third-richest man, is known far 
and wide as the “Oracle of Omaha” for his prowess in picking stocks. Unfortunately, Buffett made an unusually signiﬁ  cant er-ror during a speech at Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Sum-
mit. During his speech, Buffett joked that when his ﬁ  rst wife lost 
her credit card, he “made no attempt to get it back because the guy was spending less than she was.” Buffett’s quip alluded to stereotypes of women as mindless spenders that have long since been debunked. Buffett’s comment may have been in jest, but it was still in poor taste, particularly coming at a summit meant to honor ﬁ  nancially successful women. An it’s-not-the-1950s-
anymore DART to Warren Buffett. 
Florida Gov. Rick Scott prides himself on being anti-abortion. 
Of course, what that really means is that he works tirelessly to restrain the reproductive health care choices of Florida’s women as much as possible. Now, a new radio ad from the Evangelical Environmental Network is using Scott’s language against him by framing climate change as a religious and moral issue. A voi-ceover in the ad states: “I do believe we should do all we can to protect our environment. It was given to us by God.” The ad cleverly points out the hypocrisy of many pro-life conservatives, including Scott, who often only seem to care about “life” until 
the moment it leaves the womb. A show-them-what-anti-abor-
tion-really-means LAUREL to the Evangelical Environmental 
Network.Diversity means more than an all-black cast
As the fall television season continues, viewers can 
ﬁ  nally see which shows stand out as the winners 
and losers of the season. After the premiere rat-
ings of primetime network television came in, one thing 
became crystal clear: diversity works on TV. Among the 
winners are three shows on ABC: “Scandal,” “How To Get 
Away with Murder” and “Black-ish.” These three shows premiered strong with a viewership of 11.9 million, 14 
million and 10.8 million, respectively. 
These three shows have one thing in common: They 
feature a lead character who is a person of color.
Kerry Washington, the star of “Scandal,” is the ﬁ  rst 
black actress to lead a network primetime drama since Diahann Carroll in the 1970s series “Julia.”
Washington’s show blew up not only because of the 
major — albeit sometimes overdone — plot twists, but be-cause people of color, particularly black people, tuned in 
after ﬁ  nally seeing themselves represented on television. Scandal’s success led to the selection of Viola Davis as the 
lead actress on “How to Get Away with Murder.”
Davis is a seasoned actress who has performed in nu-
merous Broadway plays, ﬁ  lms and TV roles — roles that earned her two Academy Award nominations. However, 
many of the roles given to her, such as that of a pregnant mother or a housemaid, were often menial and fairly 
static. Historically, network executives simply have not 
valued black actresses the way they do white actresses — even someone with the credentials of Davis, a graduate of 
the Juilliard School.
ABC continued the trend of placing black actors in 
leading roles by premiering the show “Black-ish,” featur-ing Anthony Anderson. The show includes an all-black 
cast, and explores the experience of being black in white American culture. Black leads and all-black casts are a rare 
sight these days. The success of these shows was aided by 
an explosion of social media activity. People tweeted and used hashtags to demonstrate their approval of the new 
trend of leading black actors and actresses.
The success of ABC’s new shows is certainly worth celebrating, but a true commit-
ment to diversity will take more 
work. In fact, the term “diverse” 
itself must be re-examined. Show runners and network executives 
seem to think that diversity is 
strictly about race.
Having a diverse cast does not 
mean adding a couple of black actors and actresses into a lineup 
and calling it a day. Diversity includes people of different races, genders, sexes, religions, sexual orientations, ages, cultures and backgrounds. This is an issue through the 
ﬁ  lm and TV industries, particularly regarding those be-
hind the camera.
Minority actors are typically represented by smaller 
agencies, and the larger ones fall behind in keeping their rosters up to par with today’s demographics. Smaller agencies are less lucrative and do not have easy access 
to high-proﬁ  le work. The lack of diversity in large Hol-
lywood agencies constrains the casting options of even the most well-ﬁ  nanced directors and producers. In the same 
vein, the membership of the Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences is 94 percent white and 77 percent male, with a median age of 62. 
The entire Hollywood mentality is developed from the 
perspective of aging white men, which does not reﬂ  ect America’s growing diversity.
Unfortunately, truly diverse representation in Holly-
wood will not occur until executives see diverse shows achieve ﬁ  nancial success. Only then will they begin to seek 
out talent that is not of the white, cisgender, heterosexual 
male variety. American consumers of popular media are ready to move forward on diversity. If implemented cor-
rectly, diversity can expand the minds and horizons of the 
growing numbers of American children who rely heavily on TV to shape their beliefs and worldviews.

The least wonderful time of the 
year is upon us — midterm sea-son.
If you study at all like I do, it’s likely 
that you are reading this from a library 
or classroom right now, surrounded 
by textbooks and notes, strung out on whatever substance you’re using to stay awake.
Give yourself a break, put down 
the caffeinated beverage, and allow me to be your personal Study Edge for a different kind of test — one that you don’t have to study for and that’s OK to fail.
It’s fairly common knowledge that UF offers 
free STI testing. The testing is offered through the Alachua County Health Department as part of the Get Yourself Tested program. It’s for registered UF students who don’t have any symptoms. Meaning, if a weird rash just showed up that you’d rather not tell your parents about, you’ll have to contact your regular Student Health Care Center medical team.
Getting tested for STIs sounds a lot more daunt-
ing than it seems. But if you’re sexually active in any way possible — yes, even if you don’t have penetrative sex — it’s responsible to get tested on a regular basis.
I make it a point to do so at least once a year, 
usually at the beginning of the school year, so that I can start the year with a clean bill of health.
The STI/STD Testing Clinic in the inﬁ  rmary 
speciﬁ  cally tests for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis 
and HIV through blood and urine tests. However, 
the clinic doesn’t test for oral strains of these dis-eases and also doesn’t conduct physical exams — neither oral nor genital. You’ll need to contact your regular medical team or a clinic like Planned Par-enthood for that.
When you get to the inﬁ  rmary for your appoint-
ment, you’ll head down to the basement to check in with the red team. If it’s your ﬁ  rst time getting 
tested in the ofﬁ  ce, you’ll have some paperwork to 
ﬁ  ll out.
From there, an Alachua County Health Depart-
ment employee will take you back to an ofﬁ  ce for a 
consultation.
They’ll ask you a lot of questions, so my best ad-
vice is to review your sexual health history before you go to the appointment. It’ll save you some awk-wardness so you don’t say, “uhhhhh,” after every question, or so you don’t have to count your sexual partners on your ﬁ  ngers — not that I had to do any-thing like that.
The clinic employee will ask you about previous 
test results, if you use any form of birth control and if you’ve experienced any symptoms.
They’ll also ask you if you’ve had 
any prior STIs, when your last sexual encounter — oral, vaginal and anal — was, how many partners you’ve 
had in the past year, what type of sex 
you’re having,  if you give oral sex, if you receive oral sex and whether you typically use condoms.
Make sure to be honest with the 
clinic employee about all of these questions. Don’t skew your partner list to sound more reasonable. Don’t say you use condoms if you actually don’t — although you deﬁ  nitely should.
The employee will record all of your answers 
and then send you on your way to get blood and urine samples.
Drink some water before the appointment, since 
you do have to provide a urine sample. It’s also a good idea to eat something — and even bring a snack in case you get woozy — since you’ll get your blood drawn.
The good news: The SHCC staff is extremely 
nice and helpful. I’m laughably scared of needles, but the technician taking my blood was funny and made the process a breeze. I forgot to eat before my ﬁ  rst appointment, and when I felt faint after she took my blood, she pushed back her lunch break so she could sit with me while I ate an apple and drank some Gatorade to feel better.
If both you and your partner are getting tested, 
bring them along for moral, and even physical (read: 
hand-holding during the needle prick) support.
Your test results are available in two weeks, but 
the Health Department will call you if you have 
positive results. The employee told me during my consultation, “No news is good news.”
You can call the clinic for your test results or 
visit the inﬁ  rmary to get a printed copy if you really want to show off your health status.
If you’re interested in making an appointment, 
call 352-294-7465 to set it up Monday through Fri-
day. The appointment slots do get booked quickly, 
though. The ﬁ  rst time I got tested, I had to call four 
weeks in a row just to get an appointment, so I rec-
ommend calling earlier in the week.
The whole process took about 45 minutes for 
me, which is short enough to ﬁ  t into even the 
busiest schedule.
Even though it won’t make or break your GPA, 
an STI test is still important, so make it a priority to set up an appointment as soon as possible.

opinions@alligator.orgOn Tuesday, members of UF 
Students for a Democratic Society held a rally with 
anti-war groups from Gainesville — Code Pink, Veterans for Peace, UF Students for Justice in Pales-tine and UF College Libertarians — to protest our continued occu-pation of Afghanistan. 
Tuesday marked the U.S.’s 
13th year of war against the Af-ghan people — as we know, 13 years too long. 
Disturbingly, this anniversary 
comes just one week after Presi-dent Barack Obama’s renewed promise to keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan until 2024. It doesn’t take a scholar to understand that 13 years of unjust, failed war is 
not going to be ﬁ  xed by an addi-
tional decade of occupation and 
warmongering.
More than 40,000 NATO 
troops remain in Afghanistan in 
this year, with the overwhelming 
majority of those troops being 
American. 
As long as America wrong-
fully has military presence in 
Afghanistan, we can expect resis-
tance. It’s obvious that this situa-
tion will not be resolved by con-tinuing our occupation.  
 The cost of life has been too 
high. Although, for many Ameri-cans, it is easy to forget that we are still involved with Afghani-stan. 
The same is not true for Af-
ghans, who have no way to escape the horrors of U.S. occupation. The situation for them seems to only be getting worse, as Afghan civilian deaths have been rising since 2012 and are higher than they were in 2009.
 Within the ﬁ  rst six months 
of 2014, more than 4,000 Afghan civilians had been killed. In the Panjwai massacre, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales gunned down and murdered 16 Afghan civilians. 
In the past 13 years, more than 
20,000 Afghan civilians have been murdered due to American oc-cupation, and 2,000 U.S. soldiers have lost their lives.
 At what point will the U.S. 
government realize occupation does not work? It doesn’t work for American citizens, and it cer-tainly doesn’t work for the 20,000 dead Afghans.
During the event, speakers ex-
pressed their anger at our coun-try’s seemingly endless wars in the Middle East. 
“I don’t remember consenting 
to this,” said Angel Lauver. 
And it’s true. When did we 
consent to this? I am a citizen of the U.S., and I didn’t have any say in whether we went to war, nor whether we will continue to 
stay at war.
 Our nation’s foreign policy is 
so deeply imperialistic that a 13-
year-long war is almost entirely normalized. 
We invade new countries so 
quickly that citizens barely have a chance to notice. 
We can see that from our re-
cent bombing of Syria and ongo-ing operations in Pakistan, Ye-men and Iraq. 
This is why groups like Stu-
dents for a Democratic Society know that as Americans, we have a duty to condemn any sort of ag-gression in the Middle East. The cost has been too high, and as somebody who has grown up in the U.S., I long for a day when I can ﬁ  nally see my country not at war.

The garden at Highlands 
Presbyterian Community 
Church is green with potential, yet overgrown with expecta-tion.
Smaller, lesser-known com-
munity gardens like that of Highlands lack dedicated co-ordination with other organiza-tions, leaving them thirsty for volunteers.
Beth Hartwell, coordinator 
of the church’s gardens, is the only person in charge of the 
congregation’s lonely plot.
“It’s been a little bit discour-
aging,” said Hartwell, who 
works part time. “I’m pretty much the only one out here do-ing anything.”
With the Union Street 
Farmers Market at Bo Diddley Community Plaza and the ex-
panding appeal of organic, 
vegetarian and vegan-based restaurants, Gainesville is a hub for people with a positive atti-tude toward sustainability and community food sharing. 
The sweet potatoes, rose-
mary and cabbage currently growing in the Highlands gar-den have been cultivated and maintained by the hands of Hartwell and church members. 
The garden needs volunteers 
who can help with upkeep, she said, and students are ideal can-
didates for participation. 
“You’re so connected with 
the natural world. … It’s just 
calming,” Hartwell said.A percentage of the High-
lands garden’s produce goes to charities like St. Francis House and other city food banks.
“There’s a sense of doing 
something positive — taking 
and caring for the Earth and 
caring for the community,” Hartwell said.
Larger local organizations 
like Florida Certiﬁ  ed Organic Growers and Consumers Inc. have a paid staff with the means to coordinate and organize with UF for volunteers.
Travis Mitchell, the organi-
zation’s food project coordina-tor, said they also have student interns and host service projects for student clubs.
“I think the desire is there 
from the students, certainly from UF. Creating the sort of infrastructure and connection 
points, that’s what’s missing,” 
Mitchell said. 
UF chemical engineering 
senior Levi Davidson is a sup-porter of local grocery stores like Ward’s Supermarket and the downtown farmers market.
“I think we kind of disas-
sociate from how food is pro-
cessed and delivered to stores,” 
Davidson, 22, said. “Maybe we should know good growing practices like what’s more ethi-cal and what’s not chemically altered.”
The Highlands community 
is hosting a garden workday Nov. 8 in connection with For-age, Gainesville Gardening and Homesteading Parties and Grow Gainesville.

It’s not the year of the turtle, but 
2014 has been a record year for state 
sea turtle nesting.
Leatherback turtles reached a 
record 641 reported nests, accord-
ing to the Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission, while loggerhead nesting numbers stayed high.
“It’s showing that you have an 
endangered species that are being protected for quite a bit, and it’s showing that they’re doing pretty well,” said Simona Ceriani, FWC re-
search scientist.
The data was collected from the 
agency’s two sea turtle monitor-
ing surveys — a statewide survey, which began in 1979 and documents nesting at 190 beaches, and an index survey, which uses data from 33 dif-ferent beaches over the course of 109 days.
The index survey, which began 
May 15 and ended Aug. 31, showed that loggerhead nests were slightly more numerous than they were last 
year.
Ceriani said loggerhead nest 
numbers were high in the 1990s, 
decreased in the early 2000s and are now increasing again. 
“We don’t know why this is hap-
pening, but the trend allows us to see that the population is actually going back up,” Ciriani said. 
Leatherback nest numbers almost 
doubled from last year. Ceriani said the surveys are meant to only show state trends.
“It’s kind of misleading because 
it doesn’t mean that Florida only has 641 nests,” Ceriani said. The FWC coordinated the two 
surveys with the help of more than 2,000 individuals along 800 miles of Florida beaches.
Individuals included federal, 
state and local park personnel, mem-bers of conservation organizations, 
university researchers and private 
citizens. 
“Without that number of peo-
ple and that effort, dedication and awareness, we couldn’t look at this type of information,” Ceriani said. 
Zach Steinhauser, a UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation senior, said the news was relieving. 
“Hearing news that nesting is up 
for loggerheads, greens and leather-backs is fantastic news because it’s starting to show that what conser-vationists have done to work with people is working,” Steinhauser, 22, said. Florida sea turtle nests on the rise10, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2014

UF’s College of Education project 
added ﬁ  ve more states to its $25 mil-
lion project to assist teachers in better serving students with disabilities.
The Collaboration for Effective 
Educator Development, Account-ability and Reform Center (CEE-DAR) provides opportunities for teachers to master specialized in-struction and help their students with disabilities succeed. Paul Sindelar, a co-director for 
the center, said New Hampshire, Georgia, Utah, Montana and Ohio were the latest states to join the pro-gram.
The Ofﬁ  ce of Special Education 
Programs of the U.S. Department of 
Education federally funds the cen-
ter.Sindelar said UF’s program acts as a technical assistance center to im-prove leadership planning.
“We have a speciﬁ  c focus on the 
preparation of classroom teachers and the success of students with dis-abilities,” Sindelar said. 
Florida, California, Connecticut, Illinois and South Dakota were the ﬁ  rst states to participate in the proj-ect when it received its initial fund-ing in January 2013.
The Ofﬁ  ce of Special Education 
Programs has already committed $15 million to the project, and it will donate another $10 million through 
2017, when 10 more states take part 
in the project. Sindelar described the project’s application process as elaborate. Fourteen states applied, but only ﬁ  ve were accepted.
“It is a very competitive, rigorous 
application process with much care-ful review,” Sindelar said.
The center also works with states 
to reform policy on students with disabilities by writing new stan-dards and licensure. 
Mary Little, a University of Cen-
tral Florida professor and excep-tional student educator, works with researching and planning for the na-tional center. Little said UF manages the three universities in Florida that are part of the center.
“The program is a cohesive and 
systemic  approach to educational reform,” she said. 
Erin Neely, a UF education ju-
nior, is pursuing an early childhood education degree with a strong fo-
cus in special education. She said 
she has seen positive changes in spe-cial education classrooms. 
“Students with special needs 
require more attention,” Neely, 20, said. “Teachers must be prepared to exert that extra effort to ensure that they are giving students with special needs the best education possible.”

It isn’t a matter of if the record 
will be broken, but when.
Taylor Burke, Florida’s senior 
goalkeeper, has had a remarkable 
collegiate career with the Gators. 
She has 182 saves and 26 solo shut-
outs in her 76 appearances in the net for UF.
Those 26 shutouts are only one 
less than the record number of 27 held by Florida’s Katie Fraine from 2006 to 2010. With six remain-ing regular season games on the Gators’ schedule this year, Burke 
should hold the record by the end 
of the season.
“I don’t really think about it,” 
Burke said regarding the shutout record. “It’s just kind of in the back of my mind, and my whole career I’ve had an unbelievable back line in front of me, so I think I owe a lot of credit to them.”
With just one game this coming 
weekend against Mississippi State, Burke can only tie the shutout re-cord. But seeing as Mississippi State is 0-5 in Southeastern Con-ference play and last in the SEC with only 12 goals scored this year, Burke’s chances look pretty good.
Just this past weekend, in Flor-
ida’s wins over then No. 9 Texas A&M and Arkansas, the 6-foot-1 Medina, Ohio, native had one of her best road trips of the season. 
She tied her career-high with eight 
saves against the Aggies, who lead the SEC in scoring, and recorded the shutout.
Burke’s saves against Texas 
A&M were not typical slow-rolling shots or can-of-corn ﬂ  oaters either. She came out and attacked the Ag-gies’ forwards and forced them to 
take bad shots. That’s the extra lev-
el that she brings to the goalkeeper position.
“I think, especially as of late, 
she’s really come up with some saves that have kept us in games, what more can you ask from a keeper?” coach Becky Burleigh said of Burke. “She’s making the 
routine saves, but she’s also mak-
ing saves that have kept us in games.”
With her performance against 
Texas A&M, Burke was nationally recognized as the Capital One Cup Impact Performer of the Week.
“It was deﬁ  nitely cool,” Burke 
said. “Being a national award, that was really cool and I’m really ex-cited and just honored to be looked at a national level.”
Then, in Sunday’s game against 
Arkansas, Burke followed up her eight-save performance with six 
saves against the Razorbacks. No 
shutout though, as Florida would win 3-1.
The most goals allowed by 
Burke this season in a single game is two. That only happened once, in Florida’s ﬁ  rst loss of the year to Oklahoma. She has given up only seven goals all season in 947 min-
utes of play, which is second best 
in the SEC.
Last year, Burke ﬁ  nished the 
season with a goals-against-aver-age of 0.54, the lowest season GAA in Florida soccer history. That’s comparable to a very impressive ERA for a baseball pitcher. Taylor Burke is to the Gators as Clayton 
Kershaw is to the Dodgers.
Needless to say, Florida has 
greatly beneﬁ  ted from Burke’s big 
time plays as a goalkeeper for the Gators over the last four years.
“Her leadership back there and 
her experience is just a big part of what we do,” Burleigh said.
Burke has one standout trait as a goalkeeper that is very valuable. Dependability. She is trusted to make the right decisions, and her teammates and coaches know that she has the capability of making just about any save.
As she now closes in on the 
school shutout record, Burke hopes to cement her place in Florida soc-cer history. But she’s still taking her senior season one game at a time.
“We’re just looking forward to 
this weekend,” Burke said, “and 
hopefully we can get a shutout and 
a win.”

Taylor Burke kicks the ball during Florida’s 2-1 win against Geor-
gia on Sept. 26 at James G. Pressly Stadium.
Per the statement, a third individual gave police 
testimony that he had sex with the alleged victim 
less than an hour before alleged sexual conduct with the client took place, that the alleged victim was actually the aggressor in that interaction and 
the investigation produced no evidence that the al-
leged victim was impaired.
The statement said Harris’ camp has provided 
police with six witnesses including multiple that say Harris and the alleged victim were smiling and holding hands when they returned to the Spring Residential Complex. They were dropped off by another female student who is the alleged victim’s friend.
“We have previously indicated that we do not 
believe that Mr. Harris will be arrested or pros-ecuted,” the statement said. “That is because of our experience and the facts of this case. He is not guilty of a crime and he did not mistreat this young lady in any way that night.”Goalkeeper on verge of school record for career solo shutouts

After a subpar performance in its 
ﬁ  rst tournament of the season, the 
Florida women’s golf team will be looking to turn things around as it heads to Chapel Hill, N.C., for the an-
nual Tar Heel Invitational, which be-
gins today.
Coach Emily Glaser and the team 
had three weeks off from competition to clean up issues from the ﬁ  rst tour-nament. 
The team has competed at the Fin-
ley Golf Course over the last couple of years and going to the tournament 
with prior experience at the course 
will only help the team.
“It’s a tournament we’ve played in 
the last few years,” Glaser said, “so we’re familiar with the golf course, at least for the girls that will be returning to the tournament. … So we’re looking forward to going and playing.”
One of the players returning to Fin-
ley Golf Course this year will be junior Ursa Orehek. Orehek struggled two years ago 
at the course as a freshman when she ﬁ  nished with a score of 23-over-par. Having a solid approach to each hole is imperative to shooting a low score on the course.  
“It’s not a tight course, but it’s also 
not very wide,” Orehek said. “You have to have a very good strategy, 
where to place the golf ball and if you 
miss the green, you have to have a good short game because the greens are very fast.
“You have a lot of different breaks 
there, so you have to be comfortable with your short game.”
Along with Orehek, sophomore 
Maria Torres played at Chapel Hill as 
a freshman. 
Torres ﬁ  nished at 5-over-par, 
which was good enough for a tie for 
32nd place. Sophomore Kelly Grassel participated at the tournament as a freshman at Michigan State.
Grassel ﬁ  nished in a tie for 19th 
place after carding a 2-over-par for the event. Rounding out the Gator lineup is freshman Taylor Tomlinson, who made her collegiate debut in UF’s ﬁ  rst tournament of the year.
UF will be facing some of the top 
teams in the country this weekend, with nine teams ranked in the top-25. Five of the nine teams are in the Southeastern Conference with No. 1 South Carolina and No. 2 Arkansas 
leading the ﬁ  eld.
Winning the tournament is going 
to be the primary goal for each team at 
the tournament but for Glaser, play-ing better and seeing improvement from the Cougar Classic is just as im-portant. The Gators will have their shot starting today, to show Glaser how good the team can really be.  
“I just want to see that we’re im-
proving, to me that’s the biggest key, obviously not the way we wanted to ﬁ  nish the ﬁ  rst week out,” Glaser said. “As long as we keep getting better, we keep practicing better, we keep learn-ing I think that’s going to be key for this team to keep building conﬁ  dence moving forward in the season.”
Florida heads to N.C. for second tourneyIAN COHEN
Alligator Writer @icohenb
Mary Wise already knew the answer to 
the question she was about to ask.
After Florida’s 3-0 sweep of Mississippi 
State on Sunday, a match that was far more competitive than the final score indicated, 
Wise asked the opposing team’s coach to 
evaluate her player’s performance.
“She quickly said it was the best match 
they’ve played all year,” Wise said.
And yet, Mississippi State failed to win 
a set.The ceiling for this year’s Florida team 
is high, potentially higher than last year’s second-round exit from the NCAA tourna-ment.
No. 9 Florida (10-3, 4-0 Southeastern 
Conference) will continue to test itself against SEC rivals Georgia (9-6, 1-2 SEC) tonight at 7 and No. 19 Texas A&M (10-4, 2-1 SEC) on Sunday at 2 p.m.
Wise knows that opponents play their 
best against Florida, and that’s what she’s projecting for this weekend.
“That’s what we come to expect,” Wise 
said. “We will get other team’s best perfor-
mances. It has something to do with play-
ing the Gators.”
UF sees it as a huge advantage that the 
weekly competition it faces feels more like post-season play than a mid-season 
match.
It allows them to prepare for the NCAA 
tournament.
It allows little room for complacency; 
Little room for smugness; And little room 
for overconfidence.
“I think that’s the nature of the sport,” 
senior Taylor Unroe said. “You’re win-ning, but its not like you’re playing the 
same team over and over and over again. 
You’re playing different people, different coaching staffs, different systems. I think it’s easy for us not to be complacent be-
cause we know we have to compete.”
Middle blocker Simone Antwi agrees.
“We don’t have time to be complacent,” 
the junior said.
And this season, they haven’t been.Florida is leading the SEC in hitting 
percentage (.291) and is second in kills, (13.7/set), service aces (1.4/set) and as-sists (12.7/set).
UF’s defensive specialists are arguably 
its biggest strength. They boast a .970 re-ception percentage, higher than at least five teams ranked in the top-10, including No. 1 Stanford (.953).
Despite Florida’s league-leading sta-
tistics and its fast start to conference play, Unroe said the team has managed to find a comfortable balance in its confidence level.
“I think our confidence is an evolving 
thing,” Unroe said. “It’s different every week. We’re not overly confident at any point, and we’re not less confident at any point.”
Florida owes its success to its commit-
ment to improve week-after-week, even when it feels as if there isn’t much room for improvement.
“We don’t just win a game and be like 
‘oh we won the game, let’s move on,’” Antwi said. “If we won or we lost, what can we take from it? We’re always coming in the gym and working on something.”
Florida will look to improve on its five-
match winning streak and undefeated SEC record against Georgia.
“We know that we have a tough week-
end,” Unroe said. “We’re just trying to fo-cus on one game at a time and know that we’re going to get every team’s best shot. We’re expecting them to compete really hard.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 13

GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer
@Graham311
Entering her eighth year as UF’s head women’s basketball 
coach, Amanda Butler is quickly able to grasp where the team is 
on both sides of the court and where they need to make the most improvements. 
With just over a month until the team opens the season against 
Jacksonville, Butler is putting a heavy emphasis on the defensive side of the ball. 
“This year we look to be a much better defensive unit than we 
were last year,” Butler said at the team’s media day on Thursday. “The way they will compete, you should see that on the court.” 
Admittedly, the Gators struggled on defense last year. With 
redshirt junior center Viktorija Dimaite sidelined all of last season with a torn ACL in her left knee, the team often had to rely on redshirt senior Kayla Lewis to defend the post in her absence. 
Lewis, the tallest healthy player on the team last year at 6-foot, 
performed notably well in the role. She led the Gators in rebound-ing and was the team’s No. 2 scorer despite often playing out of her comfortable guard position. 
This year, though, things are different. Along with the return of Dimaite, the Gators welcome incom-
ing freshmen Haley Lorenzen and Brooke Copeland to help shore up what could be a dangerous frontcourt if the team gels well and remains healthy. 
“Every one of these freshmen we recruited with the expecta-
tion that they’ll make an impact.” Butler said. “We weren’t very big last year, so the opportunity is there for Haley, right out of the gate, to make herself important.”
The 6-foot-3 Lorenzen will see time at center this year and ease 
the pressure on Dimaite, who is healthy but still dealing with soreness in the knee that’s kept her off the court for two years.

When I got home 
Wednesday night, I wanted to get away 
from everything.
Between the late nights at 
the ofﬁ  ce and the developments that were sporadically coming 
in the Treon Harris investiga-
tion, I needed an escape, even if it was brief.
So I sat down in my dorm and watched 
the one movie I always watch whenever I 
have the opportunity: “The Blind Side.”
The movie about NFL offensive lineman 
Michael Oher and his story from poverty to 
becoming a ﬁ  rst-round draft pick by the Bal-
timore Ravens is my favorite sports movie 
(“Remember the Titans” is an extremely close second). It came out in November 2009, just about two years after I started actively following football.
And then, during the scene from Oher’s 
ﬁ  rst high school football game at Wing-ate Christian School — a ﬁ  ctional version of Memphis (Tenn.) Briarcrest Christian School — I heard the Sandra Bullock-played Leigh 
Anne Touhy say the one phrase 
I hear her say every other time I watched the ﬁ  lm:
“Run the dang ball.”
When she said it, my mind 
raced back to Wednesday’s 
football media availability — 
the ﬁ  rst one we had since news about the Harris incident broke. 
It brought me back to Florida’s offensive 
mindset throughout the past three years, where the Gators utilized the ground-and-pound gameplan and had mixed results.
It had me thinking.And it reafﬁ  rmed my thoughts that I had 
for UF’s approach when it faces LSU Satur-day night in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium when I wrote my story for Wednesday’s paper: Flor-
ida needs to run the ball — and run it a lot.
To put it simply, the Tigers have been ﬂ  at-
out terrible defending the run. They give up an average of 183.3 rushing yards per game, 
which is 90th out of 128 FBS teams and last among the 14 teams in the Southeastern 
Conference.
In its last three games — a win against 
New Mexico State and losses to Auburn and 
Mississippi State — LSU has given up an av-
erage of 257.3 yards.
Florida’s passing game has been stagnant 
ever since its 42-21 loss to Alabama on Sept. 
20, totaling just 169 total yards through the air in its past two games.
So why wouldn’t it revert back to the 
ground game when its opposing defense is terrible at defending the run?
Even though starting running back 
Matt Jones is a game-time decision with knee swelling, coach Will Muschamp said Wednesday that he is conﬁ  dent in his stable of running backs.
“I’ve got conﬁ  dence in Kelvin (Taylor), 
I’ve got conﬁ  dence in Mack Brown,” Mus-champ said. “Adam Lane has been over rep-ping with our guys the last couple of days just in case, a guy that I have tremendous conﬁ  dence in him as well. … And then you add Brandon Powell to the mix of a guy 
who’s going to get some snaps Saturday in 
some different roles. So excited about that position.”
But Muschamp’s conﬁ  dence in the tail-
backs hasn’t translated to playing time on the ﬁ  eld so far this season.
Taylor — who took over as Florida’s start-
ing running back in 2013 after Jones’ season-ending meniscus injury against LSU — has 
just 30 rushing attempts this season, which is 
less than half of Jones’ 72 and two less than starting quarterback Jeff Driskel.
Mack Brown, who led the Gators in rush-
ing yards in 2013 (543), has just six attempts and 58 yards on the ground this year and none since the season opener.
If Muschamp has the conﬁ  dence in those 
running backs like he says he does, the 
fourth-year head coach needs to set them 
free.
And he needs to run the dang ball.

twitter: @J_McPherson1126Despite being on the team for 
three years, Dimaite has never 
played a game for the Gators. A graduate from The Rock School in Gainesville, Dimaite missed 
her entire freshman season af-
ter dislocating her right ankle over the summer before she even stepped on campus. 
She rehabbed successfully to 
return to the team the following season only to tear her ACL for the ﬁ  rst time on Nov. 3, 2012 and again less than a year later. 
Now that Dimaite ﬁ  nally 
looks ready to make her debut as a Gator, she has some depth behind her. 
“She’s worked so hard ev-
ery year, and while it’s one of the unfortunate parts of our game, she’s also handled it with a great deal of toughness 
and grace, and been an awe-
some leader in that regard for our players,” Butler said. “I just hope she gets what she de-serves this season.”
While the Gators are rich in 
the backcourt, with nine of 13 players listed as a guard, they all bring versatility to the posi-
tion. 
Redshirt junior Cassie Peo-
ples is a player that has con-
tinued to surprise her coach. Despite being slightly under-sized at 5-foot-6, Peoples plays 
like she is unaware of her own 
height. 
“Cassie doesn’t know that 
she has any physical shortcom-ings, so don’t tell her anything,” Butler said, jokingly. “She’s just as big as anybody.”
A consistent slasher, Peo-
ples has expanded her game 
by improving on her three-point shot. After only taking 15 three-pointers her ﬁ  rst season 
in 2011-2012 before transferring 
from Texas, Peoples repeatedly 
showed the conﬁ  dence to take a shot from behind the arc last season, converting nearly 30 
percent of her attempts. 
“She’s been really dominant 
this summer with her condition-ing level, her body, her mental makeup, and she’s grown more 
into a leadership role and em-
braced that, I’ve been so proud 
of those things,” Butler said.
Many players, including 
freshman Dyandria Anderson 
and sophomore Ronni Wil-
liams, have experience playing larger positions despite their smaller size. Their knowledge 
of positions different than their 
own is only a beneﬁ  t to the 
growth of the team. 
With 16 of their 29 games 
coming against teams that 
made the 2014 Postseason, the 
Gators will have to rely on a 
tough nonconference sched-ule that includes St. John’s and Georgetown to prepare them for the ever-competitive South-eastern Conference. 
For a team that took ﬁ  fth in 
the SEC last year, the Gators are 
conﬁ  dent that they can improve 
on last season’s ﬁ  nish. 
With numerous outlets de-
scribing the Gators’ season last 
year as an “overachievement,” 
the sentiment around the team is that it’s a new season and the only expectations that matter are their own. The team thinks they can advance farther than the second round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost last year 83-61 to Penn State. 
The only expectation is to play 
as well as their coach has seen them play.
“This group has really taken 
the challenge of what they did last year, where they all played giant roles and were important in different ways, and they’re more motivated and inspired 
to do more,” Butler said.
“Look at what we did with 
a bunch of short kids and no 
bench. We’ve got depth now, we’ve got size now, but we still have to have that same sort of ﬁ  ght and spirited resilience in all the things they possess. There’s nothing we can do about last year, and that return-ing group is really practicing and preparing with a great deal 
of purpose and a high sense of 
accountability for those holes being plugged now.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 19

With all the controversy sur-
rounding the Florida football 
program as backup quarterback Treon Harris is under investiga-tion for an alleged sexual bat-
tery and a scufﬂ  e between Skyler 
Mornhinweg and Gerald Willis III, it seems off the ﬁ  eld issues are the only things happening in Gainesville right now.
But Florida (3-1, 2-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) looks to put the focus back to football Saturday as it takes on LSU (4-2, 0-2 SEC) at 
7:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium. 
Florida’s defense is coming 
off an impressive showing on the road at Neyland Stadium during a 10-9 victory over SEC East rival Tennessee. 
Two weeks before that, the unit 
gave up a program-high 672 total 
yards against Alabama. 
UF defensive coordinator 
D.J. Durkin said the turnaround 
wasn’t due to any major adjust-ments in the two weeks before 
facing Tennessee.
“It was us getting back to our 
fundamentals and basics of what 
we’re asked to do and doing it with great urgency and you know communicating with one another, being on the same page,” Durkin said. “And I think refocusing on those things, just the ﬁ  ne details what we do, they saw the results 
of it.”
True freshman cornerback 
Jalen Tabor, who stepped on cam-
pus in January as the No. 3 ranked cornerback in the 2014 recruiting class, had his breakout perfor-mance against the Volunteers, racking up four solo tackles and a sack. 
Making his ﬁ  rst career start, 
he caused and recovered a Justin Worley fumble late in the third quarter to give Florida the ball back on Tennessee’s 30-yard line. His one pass breakup on the day came in the end zone.
“Anytime a guy goes out there 
and makes a lot of plays, and he had a great pass breakup in the end zone there the one sud-den change situation and got the ball off the quarterback and had another pass breakup on third down, he was productive, made some plays, keeping going and getting better.” Durkin said. 
True freshman Duke Dawson, 
who earned his ﬁ  rst start at safety last week, had four total tack-les. Durkin was pleased with his performance in the secondary as well. 
“He was locked in, communi-
cated well and was on the same page with his assignments,” Dur-
kin said. “I thought he played re-
ally well. I think he’ll gain a lot of conﬁ  dence from that perfor-mance.”
There has been no word on if 
both Dawson and Tabor starting at corner and safety will be a per-manent change within the second-ary moving forward. 
LSU has not named a starting 
quarterback for Saturday. Sopho-more Anthony Jennings started for the Tigers in the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve weeks of the season but did not start last week on the road against Auburn. 
LSU’s starter last week was 
true freshman Brandon Harris, who in the week prior to facing 
Auburn led the LSU offense to 
seven touchdowns against New Mexico State. 
Brandon Harris went 3-for-14 
against Auburn, earning himself a spot on the bench in the third quarter. Durkin said that both Brandon 
Harris and Jennings present simi-lar challenges. 
“Both guys have very strong 
arms. They’ve made a lot of big plays down the ﬁ  eld,” Durkin said. “Those are things we’ve gotta be cognizant of and aware of, I think they’re probably mak-ing they’re determination of who they feel can run the offense the best.”
The Tigers’ receiving corps is 
led by Travin Dural, who is av-eraging an explosive 26.1 yards per reception and has ﬁ  ve touch-downs. 
Behind Dural the production 
drops a bit — Malachi Dupre has  10 receptions for 249 yards. 
Durkin says one of the biggest 
problems that the receivers cause is gaining yardage after the catch, but they aren’t afraid to go up and catch the long ball, either.
“They’re going to take shots 
down the ﬁ  eld, play action pass and hit it up top,” Durkin said. “And so they have the guys that can go up and get it. They’re big, 
long receivers. So yeah it is when 
you look at that number yards per catch, it’s pretty astonishing.”
Perhaps the most impressive 
statistic of Florida’s game defen-sively at Tennessee last week was stopping the run — it held the Volunteers to just 28 yards on the ground, the lowest rushing out-
put for Tennessee all season. 
The defense has its hands full 
going up against the LSU rush-
ing attack, led by true freshman tailback Leonard Fournette, who was the No. 1 running back pros-pect in the country in last year’s recruiting class. 
Fournette has 364 yards on 
66 carries along with four touch-downs. Behind Fournette is senior Kenny Hilliard, who averages 51.5 yards on the ground per game.
