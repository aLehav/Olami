The long-awaited trial of Pedro Bravo begins today at 
9 a.m.
The Santa Fe student is accused of murdering his friend 
Christian Aguilar, a UF student, in September 2012.
When Aguilar was ﬁ  rst reported missing, by his girl-
friend and Bravo, it launched a huge, community-wide 
search.
His body was found in the woods in Levy County a 
few weeks later.
Two years have passed, and Monday marked the ﬁ  rst 
day in the criminal trial of Pedro Bravo. 
He faces seven charges, from ﬁ  rst degree murder to 
kidnapping, poisoning and the mishandling of human re-mains. He’s also charged with lying to police, tampering 
with evidence and providing false reports.
The trial is expected to last two weeks, said State At-
torney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokesman Darry Lloyd.
The state of Florida, the prosecutor in the case, has 120 
possible witnesses listed, he said.
The list is largely police ofﬁ  cers but also includes medi-
cal examiners, Walmart loss-prevention specialists and 
Spyglass Apartment employees.
Monday’s jury selection ended with the state and de-
fense in agreement over 12 jurors and two alternates. 
Both parties had up to 10 opportunities to “strike” a 
juror out of the possible pool. The state used seven strikes, with one alternate strike. The defense used ﬁ  ve strikes, as well as an alternative strike.
Bravo has pled not guilty, and the state is not seeking 
the death penalty.

Library West is about to get a face-
lift.
The current colonnade, the covered 
brick structure outside the entrance, 
will undergo a $1.5 million upgrade, in-
volving solar-powered chargers, tables 
and study lighting.
Barbara Hood, director of library 
communications, said fundraising will begin in the next few months and will continue until they have enough to be-gin building.
She said the start date will all de-
pend on when the money is done being 
raised, but once it begins, it should be completed in about 77 days.
The current colonnade will be par-
tially taken down and then rebuilt to 
be taller and narrower than the existing one, which covers the historic entrance to Smathers Library, Hood said.
In the middle of the new colonnade 
there will be a statue of a gator, similar to the one outside of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
As it stands now, students lounge on 
the colonnade itself. In the new design,  the ﬂ  oor will be expanded to allow for tables and benches.
But Rebekah Fitzsimmons a 30-year-
old UF English Ph.D candidate, likes to sit on the colonnade. She leans back on one of the pillars as she talks.Library West renovation

Elyse Simek prepares for a night of study-
ing the same way every time.
Stop at Library West. Order a grande non-
fat triple hazelnut macchiato at Starbucks. 
Walk to Marston Science Library.
However, with a Starbucks location open-
ing up on the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor of the library in early 
2015, Simek, a 19-year-old UF exploratory en-
gineering sophomore, will no longer have to make a pit stop.
“One of the most frequent requests we re-
ceive from students is for coffee,” said Val-rie Minson, Marston Science Library chair-
woman. “Having coffee in the building will 
be both convenient and appreciated.”
David Looney, associate director for the 
UF business services division, said a budget 
or timeline for completion has not yet been 
established.
“We’re still trying to pull together the de-
tails,” he said.The addition is a part of the Marston study 
space renovations, known as Collaboration Commons, which will add more than 700 seats, including 21 study rooms for students come Fall. 
Steve Orlando, UF spokesman, said one 
advantage of having a location in the library is that students don’t have to make the trek to 
Library West and interrupt their studying.
“If you need Starbucks, it’s easier if it’s 
right there,” he said.
Simek agrees.“I think it’s a really good option if they 
make it open along with library hours,” she 
said. “I know people who go to West to study solely because they can’t get coffee at any point they want to.”BRAVO

Students now have an al-
ternative to paying exorbitant 
fees for ﬁ  xing their cracked smartphone screens.
ICare Smartphone Repair, 
located in the SouthGate Cen-tre just south of Archer Road and 34th Street, is a locally owned business opened by Boyd Brown, 22, a UF adver-tising alumnus.
“For students, I’m pret-
ty much the best price in Gainesville,” Brown said.
Brown buys, repairs and 
trades phones. The iPhone 4 models are repaired for $50, while the iPhone 5 models are repaired for $80. It takes about 15 minutes to ﬁ  x a phone.
Brown said he offers every-
thing the big businesses offer, including a 90-day guarantee.
He said he makes sure he 
is knowledgeable about what-ever smartphone a customer brings in.
“I’ll probably go get a (an 
iPhone) 6 as soon as it comes out, and just come back here and take it apart,” Brown said. “I’d rather break my own ﬁ  rst before somebody else’s.”
The services aren’t limited 
to iPhones. Brown ﬁ  xes Sam-
sung Galaxy phones and iP-
ads. He also sells off-contract phones and prepaid phone plans starting at $50 a month.
This business idea actually 
started as a hobby.
Brown said during his 
freshman year, he and a friend repaired some phones they had laying around and sold them on Craigslist. They sold really fast, he said.
That’s when inspiration 
hit.
Repairing phones was a 
way to cover expenses without taking out loans, Brown said. The only difference between now and then is a storefront.
Brown said he always 
planned on staying in Gainesville after graduation, but he decided to start his busi-ness because he didn’t ﬁ  nd any 
jobs that he was interested in.
“I always wanted to start 
my own business,” he said. 
“I didn’t think it would be so fast.”
In the future, Brown said he 
plans on getting involved in a program that donates some money to charity for every dollar he makes. 
He also plans on expanding 
his business.
This entrepreneurial mind 
is nothing new for Brown, as it runs in the family. His mother 
owns a dance studio, and his 
father owns a tire company.
“We as a family absolutely 
knew that one day he would own his own business and we’re very proud of him,” said 
Cindy Brown, Brown’s moth-
er. “He certainly worked hard to get his ﬁ  rst store open.”
Brown said there are always 
rough patches when a business is getting started, but he is op-timistic about the future.
“Even though there’s not a 
whole lot of jobs in the market, 
there’s jobs to be made your-
self,” he said. “You can always ﬁ  nd something to do.”UF alumnus turns 
small jobs into big local business

A popular friendly greeting may 
not be as innocent as it seems. 
Although handshakes might be 
the preferred method of greeting 
others, ﬁ  st bumps might actually be 
better for your health, according to a 
recent study published in the Ameri-can Journal of Infection Control. 
The study, an experimental mod-
el to compare the transfer of bacteria during greeting exchange, found that ﬁ  st bumps transfer ten times fewer bacteria than handshakes.
“I would say microbiologically it 
only makes sense because bacteria, they like moisture, so you’re going to ﬁ  nd them in high levels where there’s moisture,” said Paul Gulig, a professor in the department of mo-lecular genetics and microbiology. 
The study found that nearly twice 
as many bacteria were transferred during a handshake compared with a high ﬁ  ve, whereas the ﬁ  st bump 
consistently gave the lowest trans-
mission of bacteria. 
Gulig said he believes the ﬁ  st 
bump, despite being a viable alter-native for the handshake, would not gain popularity as a greeting be-cause of the historical roots attached to handshakes.
“It goes all the way back at least to 
the Middle Ages,” Gulig said. “The bottom line was that if you went to shake somebody’s hand, you were basically saying ‘I don’t have a knife or a sword in my hand.’”
 “It’s a symbol of kind of like ‘I’m 
not threatening you.’”
A frequent ﬁ  st bumper, 20-year-old UF marketing junior David Nas-sau ﬁ  rst became a ﬁ  st-bump fan af-ter seeing a Miami Heat game with a friend.
“Dwyane Wade and Lebron 
James would do this double-tap ﬁ  st bump on the side. It was something small, but we thought it was the cool-est thing,” Nassau said. “It just be-came a thing and casually evolved.” 
However, Nassau agrees that 
the ﬁ  ndings of the study will not be enough to change individual greet-ing habits.
“In business, there are certain 
ways to go about things and that is going to be very difﬁ  cult to change,” Nassau said.
“However, in a casual setting, I 
think that studies like this will help people try to change their ways a little bit.”
Fist bumps reducing spread of germsFitzsimmons isn’t sure the colonnade is what UF should 
be putting $1.5 million toward.
“It definitely looks dated,” she said, looking around at 
the colonnade.
It isn’t a waste of money to improve the colonnade, she 
said, but there are higher priorities.
People have done the math and found it would only take 
$6 million to waive fees for graduate students, she said. 
She thinks $1.5 million would be better served if it went 
toward that.
Victoria Fitts, a 21-year-old UF linguistics junior, could 
only ask why when she heard about the construction plans.
“That’s a complete waste of money,” she said.
The colonnade is fine, and when you walk up to Smathers 
,you can clearly see the entrance, she said.
She said she wonders what work on the colonnade will 
do to people trying to get into the library.
“I think if there’s anything they’re gonna do, they should 
make Library West bigger,” she said.
Construction at the entrance will just add to the conges-tion, and it’s already so crowded, she said.
“There’s a million better things that money can go to,” 
she said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, AUGUST 5, 2014
Aug. 9, 1977
A toxic gas leak in the Shands 
Teaching Hospital spurred a $10,000 investigation into a mys-tery illness. The June gas leak 
was followed by at least 130 
employees to complain of vari-ous illnesses, ranging from itch-ing and nausea to dizziness and confusion. They did find traces of ethylene oxide, but after a lengthy investigation and vari-ous impromptu fixes like spray-ing for bugs sterilizing the air, it was found to not be the culprit. They assumed most people were imagining or making symptoms worse, prompting nurses to say, 
“Here come those turkeys again, 
those nothing-wrong-with-them people.”
Aug. 4, 1987Students weren’t catching the 
“crack fever.” UF students were smoking marijuana, popping diet pills and binge drinking, but they continued to shun the “trendy” drug most experts said was the most addictive in the world. After almost two years on 
Gainesville streets, UF students 
hadn’t made the jump to the drug, according to Gainesville Police and anonymous surveys. While 19 percent had admitted to snorting its powdered cousin, crack only made its way into be-tween 5 and 8 percent of the UF students’ lungs.
Aug. 3, 1999Keepers of the Wall, an infor-
mal group dedicated to watching over the Southwest 34th Street memorial created in honor of the five students killed in 1990, had some scar removal to do when a “Matt” painted “People Die” over part of the memorial in a 
bone-style font with splattered 
blood red paint. “They wanted to make a shocking statement,” one passer-by said. “I’m impressed someone had the balls to do it.” Another had the opposite reac-tion: “That had some evil in it.”

A Central Florida business owner is cel-
ebrating turning 40 by running 26.2 miles to 
benefit local cancer research.
Tara Huff, founder and CEO of Bashful 
Bliss, an Orlando-based apparel and acces-
sories company, will run a marathon on 
Sunday and donate all proceeds to the UF Health Cancer Center.
Huff started the apparel company in 
2009, designing glass tile necklaces geared toward teachers, breast cancer survivors and supporters, athletes and new moms.
“A few years later, I started designing 
inspirational and fun apparel with the goal 
of making someone happy,” Huff said. “The motto for the company is that it is in the lit-
tle things in life where bliss is found.”
Huff said she plans to make her 10th 
marathon the most memorable one yet and 
has been preparing to run for more than a month.
Her fundraising goal 
is more than $5,000. She has already received $650 from friends and family members who have regis-tered for the race.
“I lost my mother and 
my best friend at the age of 
51 to breast cancer, and I am always looking for unique ways to support the fight against 
breast cancer,” Huff said. “This marathon 
means a lot to me because I have chosen 26 different friends and family members to ei-ther walk or run with me.”
Huff has designed a “Pink Ribbon Bee” T-shirt to fundraise for the event. The design is also available as a tank top, sweatshirt, hat, visor, necklace or pillow as a fundraiser.
The sales for the Pink Ribbon shirt started 
Monday, and Huff said she expects the sales to grow after the marathon and in the next few months after more people have heard 
the story and cause behind it.
Dr. Luis Herrera, thoracic surgeon and 
medical director of the Rod Taylor Thoracic 
Care Center at UFHCC Orlando Health, is a family friend of Huff’s and has known her for a few of years.
He applauded her efforts and said that 
they will make a difference. 
“Philanthropy is important to cancer be-
cause National Cancer Institute funds are difficult to get, and government funding is so competitive,” Herrera said. “Without it, it makes it hard to start up research with-out the preliminary data we need to start programs because that money goes toward supporting clinical programs and cancer re-search.”
Marcela Brandao, development coordi-
nator at UF Health Cancer Center, said phi-lanthropy, such as running marathons like Huff, makes a tremendous impact on what 
they’re able to do.
Research requires a huge amount of 
money, and in order to make breakthroughs 
in research, the center really needs to have a big funding base, Brandao said.
“Grant money and other funding sources 
are harder to come by more than ever and we really do need private individuals to make the difference,” Brandao said. “We re-
ally appreciate how our community really 
rises up and helps us with this. By helping us, they’re helping anyone who has ever been touched by cancer or anyone who will be touched by cancer in the future.”

The UF Elegance of Science contest is back and 
now accepting entries.
The contest, which has been on a three-year break, 
is being organized by the Marston Science Library 
and the Florida Museum of Natural History. 
It is accepting entries of 2-D images that show the 
connection between artistic and scientific perceptions of reality from UF students, faculty and staff. 
The prize for first place is $150, second place is 
$100 and third place is $50.
The Marston Science Library held the contest in 
2008, 2009 and 2011, wrote Valrie Minson, Marston Science Library chairwoman, in an email.  
Sponsors and partners those three years in the 
Architecture and Fine Arts Library, the Health and Science Library and the UF Alumni Association were generous, she said.
“We very much wanted to hold the contest in the 
years leading up to this year’s 2014-2015 contest, but were struggling with the amount of time it takes to coordinate a successful contest,” Minson said. 
The contest will close for judging Dec. 20, and win-
ners will be announced early next year. The winning entries will be displayed at both the Marston Science Library and the Florida Museum of Natural History.
“It was a lot of fun to purposefully find the aes-
thetic aspects of my research,” said Emily Thompson, 25, a UF alumna who placed second in 2011. 
Thompson said she enjoyed participating in the 
contest and was shocked and disappointed that it had not been held for the past three years.
She said the contest is beneficial because visualiza-
tion of science and research can be difficult. 
It is an important skill for any scientist to present 
his or her work through pictures and infographics. 
“Some of the large research conferences, like the 
biannual Materials Research Society, also have sci-ence art competitions,” Thompson said. “I think it is really enjoyable to take a second and appreciate that not only is the research scientists do around the world really awesome in terms of innovation and future im-pact, it can also be very beautiful.”
Participants can submit up to five entries. Instruc-
tions for submitting entries are at flmnh.ufl.edu/ele-gance-science/overview/.Art and Science

caMPUSTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Two American aid workers infected with Ebola are get-
ting an experimental drug so novel, it has never been tested 
for safety in humans and was only identified as a potential treatment earlier this year, thanks to a long standing research program by the U.S. government and the military.
The workers, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, are 
improving, although it’s impossible to know whether the treatment is the reason or they are recovering on their own, as others who have survived Ebola have done. 
They were infected while working in Liberia, one of four 
West African nations dealing with the world’s largest Ebola outbreak. On Monday, the World Health Organization said the death toll had increased from 729 to 887 deaths in Guin-ea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, and that more than 1,600 people have been infected.
In a worrisome development, the Nigerian Health Min-
ister said a doctor who had helped treat Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian-American man who died July 25, days after arriving in Nigeria, has been confirmed to have the deadly disease. Tests are pending for three other people who also treated Sawyer and are showing symptoms.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, but 
several are under development.
The experimental treatment the U.S. aid workers are get-
ting is called ZMapp and is made by Mapp Biopharmaceuti-cal Inc. of San Diego. It is aimed at boosting the immune sys-tem’s efforts to fight off Ebola and is made from antibodies produced by lab animals exposed to parts of the virus.
In a statement, the company said it was working with 
LeafBio of San Diego, Defyrus Inc. of Toronto, the U.S. gov-ernment and the Public Health Agency of Canada on devel-opment of the drug, which was identified as a possible treat-ment in January.
The statement says very little of the drug is available, and 
they are “cooperating with appropriate government agen-cies to increase production as quickly as possible,” but gives no details on who else might receive it or when.
Writebol, 59, has been in isolation at her home in Libe-

Writebol has received two doses of the experimental drug 
so far, but Johnson was hesitant to credit the treatment for her improvement.Brantly, 33, who works for the international relief group 
Samaritan’s Purse, also was said to be improving. Besides the experimental dose he got in Liberia, he also received a 
unit of blood from a 14-year-old boy, an Ebola survivor, who 
had been under his care that seems to be aimed at giving 
Brantly antibodies the boy may have made to the virus.� UF WILL INSTALL POSTS.

Courtney McEwen spent her 
summer saving up for a new 
bike. 
The 19-year-old UF nutrition-
al sciences sophomore said she loves her new set of wheels. 
She likes to ride it to the gro-
cery store, to the gym, where she works. She can’t wait to ride her bike more in the future. 
But starting in the Fall, the one 
place she can’t ride her bike is 
through the Norman Tunnel.
Due to several complaints 
from UF faculty and other mem-
bers of the UF community, a con-
struction team will renovate the 
tunnel to make it safer for pedes-trians. 
The team will install a series 
of posts and railings to separate 
the traffic and slow down the bi-
cycles. 
“The mix of biker and pedes-
trian traffic in the tunnel really 
isn’t as safe as we’d like it to be,” 
said Scott Fox, director of Trans-portation and Parking Services at UF. 
When bicyclists enter the tun-
nel, many of them struggle to build up enough momentum to 
pull their weight up the steep in-
cline at the other end, Fox said.
In the past, they tried to cre-
ate separate lanes for bikers and pedestrians, he said, but they had 
limited success because people 
really don’t stay in their lanes. 
Because of the graffiti in the 
tunnel, any lines and signs placed in the tunnel were ineffective be-cause they’d just get covered up.
“Our goal is to create a safer 
tunnel experience for every-body,” he said.
When McEwen rides over to 
Norman, she said she won’t mind hopping off her bike.
She said she understands that 
some might be annoyed by the changes, but if the renovations mean that people will be safer 
when using the tunnel, it’s a good 
trade-off. 
“At the worst, it will add 30 
seconds to your travel time if you are a biker,” she said.TUESDAY, AUGUST 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

My major is none of your concern 
Three semesters ago when I started my ﬁ  rst day at 
the Alligator, I never thought I’d be typing these words so soon.
I thought that I was going to spend the rest of my col-
lege career at this paper I put my heart and soul into — with colleagues and classmates I have come to call some of my best friends. So here it is, my last week at the Alligator, and it couldn’t be more bittersweet. 
But instead of telling you what I did and how I’m going 
to remember it, I’m going to tell you about my future. 
I have lost count of how many times I’ve been asked 
“What’s your major?” during my time at UF, only to have people lecture me that print media is dying, that my de-gree may be worthless in the years to come. And to those people I say: “Watch me.” 
Watch me as I learn new ways to tell stories to the audi-
ence of the future. Watch me build smartphone and tablet apps that are so user-friendly, a child could read and un-derstand even the densest article. Watch me change the design of news websites and blow paywalls into the his-tory books. Watch me as I reinvigorate print media. 
My generation, dubbed “millennials,” is special. Some 
of us have seen life with and without the Internet, and as the world ﬁ  ghts to climb the technology curve, it is my generation that is going to ﬁ  gure out how to use this tech-nology in ways we have never seen before. These millen-nial journalists are going to reimagine what it means to tell stories in ways you’d never believe, and I want you doubters to watch me as I do it. 
The content may be different, the way we tell stories 
may change and how we distribute them may evolve, but the core of journalism will remain the same. 
Tampa Bay Times writer Michael Kruse said in a 2012 
TEDxTampa Bay talk that people always tell him that they “just want the facts, just the facts, please, just the facts.”
“And these people are liars,” he said, “because nobody 
wants just the facts. It’s not who we are.” Why are they liars? Humans 
have been telling each other sto-ries since the earliest cave paint-ings 40,000 years ago. Our world revolves around stories. If click bait relays any message besides a need for web page views, it’s that people like to see what happens when a man comes face-to-face 
with a great white shark after jumping off a cliff. Does he survive? I don’t know. Let’s ﬁ  nd out.
Kruse went on to say that you can argue, but there 
have only ever been a handful of stories: rags to riches, the quest, voyage and return, overcoming the monster, etc. 
“These are how we’ve communicated with each other,” 
Kruse said. “These are the stories we told ourselves and each other before we could write them down.” 
As I gaze into the future, I see a world full of stories 
waiting to be told, and there is no better constitutionally protected profession than journalism. 
If you have a signiﬁ  cant other, you know the impor-
tance of good communication. It only takes one missing comma to screw up the way a message is received. Com-munication matters, and employers today are looking for someone who not only can write complete sentences, but one who can do it with poise and great form. 
I’m not just talking about newspapers, either. There are 
so many platforms where writers can tell stories, and as Michael Kruse points out, the future of stories is stories. 
“We think in stories, and we always have,” he said. 
“And so now, is this going to change, right now in our lifetime in 2012 because of Twitter, because of Facebook, Youtube, the Internet?”
If you say anything but no, I will tell you right now that 
you’re wrong. Watch me, and I’ll show you.

Letter to the Editor 
Dear editor,
I have just read the article in the July 
24 edition of the Alligator about meals for 
homeless folk.
Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, 100 NE 
First St., has been serving a hot breakfast 
to homeless and hungry people every Sun-
day morning since 1996. Most Sundays, the 
breakfast menu is mainly pizza from Leon-ardo’s Pizza at Millhopper. At the end of 
the day they give us the remainders of the 
pizzas they make to sell by the slice. We freeze it each day and then heat it on Sun-day.  There would not be Streetside Breakfast 
at Holy Trinity were it not for the generosity 
of Gregg Brannan and Leonardo’s Pizza at 
Millhopper!

Streetside Breakfast at Holy Trinity Episcopal Letter to the Editor
About a month ago, Vice pub-lished a quiz to test its read-ers — “Can you tell which of 
these porn star orgasms are fake?”
Apparently, I can’t. But the quiz brought up some 
good points. First, I’m glad my apartment walls are so thick. Second, faking orgasms is pretty common — and also undetectable enough that I couldn’t tell the real moans from the fake ones. 
Here’s the thing, though: An 
actual orgasm is more likely to be quiet than to be riddled with moans and “f**k yes’”, according to sex ed-ucator Laci Green’s YouTube video about faking orgasms. 
In fact, vocalization is often not 
because of excitement at all. A 2010 study done by Gayle Brewer and Colin Hendrie showed that more than 25 percent of women routine-ly used vocalization — moaning, screaming, yelling “harder” — to fake orgasm. 
If you want to get real technical, 
it makes sense that women would turn to screaming to prove an or-gasm more than men, who statisti-cally don’t fake orgasms as often, would.
Men ejaculate during orgasm. 
But it’s a little harder to tell when a woman comes, which is why they often rely on sounding like the unedited version of “Hey Baby,” by Deadmau5 to convey their plea-sure.
That’s ﬁ  ne, as long as you’re 
moaning “Don’t stop” because you actually don’t want your partner to stop. 
But if your cries of “Don’t stop” 
really mean “It’s been a long time, and my leg is cramping, so hope-fully my sexy moaning will make you come, and then we can watch reruns of ‘Friends,’” you’re not do-ing yourself, or your partner, any favors.
Using vocalization to fake or-
gasm, or just faking an orgasm through any means, gives your part-ner false positive reinforcement. 
You’re communicating that what they are doing is pleasurable 
— even if it might not be. 
I totally get it. Sometimes you’re 
distracted, and even if sex feels great, you know you’re not going to 
come. Sometimes you’re tired and don’t want to keep having sex. 
This is actually a fairly common 
phenomenon, according to Wom-
en’s Health Magazine, which iden-
tiﬁ  ed this as one of the six different reasons why women fake orgasms. 
Other reasons include wanting 
to avoid hurting their partner’s feel-
ings and feeling insecure about not 
having an orgasm.
Pretending to have an orgasm 
seems like the less awkward route compared to saying, “Hey, thanks so much for trying to get me off, but 
it’s just not working out. Good try though, champ. You’ll get it next time.”
Maybe that’s not the right thing 
to say either, but my point is that you should be saying something — not just moaning it.
When you moan and scream 
and pretend to come, your partner gets the message, “What I’m doing is good, they like this, and I’m go-ing to continue to do this because it seems to be getting them off.”
It’s more productive in the long 
run if you use your words (or even physical actions) to communicate how you’re feeling. 
If your partner just isn’t hitting 
the right spot, move your partner’s hand to a better position, or show what would feel better.
If the issue is that you’re just not 
feeling like you can reach orgasm that night, it’s just as easy as faking it to say, “What you’re doing feels so good, but I don’t think it’s going to happen right now,” and focus on your partner’s pleasure instead. 
Don’t be afraid to start a dialogue 
with your partner. It can be nerve-wracking to tell them that they’re not getting you off, but they should want you to feel good.
Start by telling them what 
they’re already doing well, and then give them suggestions on what you would like more of. This is a more constructive way of talking about such a sensitive subject, plus it’s a lot nicer than saying, “Dude, you suck at sex, and I’ve been faking it this whole time.”
Moral of the story: It’s OK to 
sound like a porn star when you have sex — provided your walls are thick — but be careful not to put on a show.
Faking it distracts from the op-
portunity to work with your partner toward having an earth-shattering, porn-worthy orgasm every time — and that’s something you deserve.

opinions@alligator.orgBeing a columnist for 
the Alligator was one of the best experienc-
es I could have asked for. It 
has brought me an unprec-
edented amount of joy for the past three semesters. I 
have enjoyed writing every 
article, forming every sen-
tence and being the most opinionated 
person in my circle of friends (it comes with the column territory). 
And just because my picture (cir-
ca-2013) will no longer grace the opin-
ions section, that does not mean I will 
keep my opinions to myself.
For my ﬁ  nal piece I have decided to 
end with some ﬁ  nal political thoughts: First and foremost, to all of the students 
at UF, realize we are the future of this 
state, country and world. We will one day be the CEOs/professors/politi-
cians/whatever of the future. We will 
have the ability to shape future events 
as we see ﬁ  t. This responsibility should 
not be taken lightly and should not be 
shrugged off.  
Second, be skeptical. If someone is 
promising something that is too good to 
be true, it probably is. Though this may 
seem commonsensical, every time an 
election is in full swing people will be-
lieve anything that a person on a stump will say. Developing an 
opinion often comes from thinking differently from the mass consensus and 
those in power. 
And last, don’t be content 
with voting for the “lesser 
of two evils.” Voting for an 
unsavory candidate for the 
sake of voting will not beneﬁ  t anyone. It seems a little odd for a columnist who talked so much about politics to be OK 
with a person not voting. 
I like to equate the situation like this: 
If you go to the store to get an apple, and 
the two apples that are available to you are not acceptable, you shouldn’t be ex-
pected to choose one apple over the oth-
er. However, this doesn’t mean that you 
become politically disenfranchised. On 
the contrary, this means that you have to ﬁ  nd other legal ways to make your voice 
heard. Running for ofﬁ  ce, lobbying or 
creating a think tank can lead to positive 
changes.    
I know that this might seem like an 
odd grab bag of fortune-cookie advice and personal musings. Well, it is. But 
one thing to take away from all of this is 
to have an opinion, back it up and ﬁ  ght 
for it. The future is counting on it.

opinions@alligator.orgAbout two years ago, my 
family and I were forced to put down our golden 
retriever. Her name was Sun-dance, and she was about 14 
years old. Cancer had taken its toll on her 
body. She was covered in tumors. She had stopped eating and was losing weight rap-idly. Someone, thinking we were abusing her, even reported our family to the police after we took a trip to the local dog park. She was that skinny. Whatever quality of life she once had was swallowed whole by her disease, and we could not stand to 
watch her decay any further.
According to the Humane Society of 
the United States’ website, U.S. shelters 
euthanize about 2.7 million cats and dogs each year, all of whom are adoptable and healthy. Our dog, Sundance, did not fall into this category of healthy animals being euthanized. She was already gone by the time the veterinarian came to our home and 
ﬁ  lled her with an intravenous injection of 
sodium pentobarbital. According to PETA’s website, these deaths by animal euthanasia are “painless, quick, and digniﬁ  ed.”
I have to agree. In cases where animals 
are left terminally ill and there is no qual-ity of life, I do support animal euthanasia, which literally means “the good death” in Greek. 
However, euthanasia for the rest of the 
2.7 million cats and dogs that are put down yearly simply because there is nowhere else to put them is inhumane, lazy and, most importantly, murder.
Although a great amount of blame can 
be placed on the shoulders of overpopulat-ed and crowded shelters, we must look at the bigger picture and equally point the ﬁ  n-
ger, in this case, at the people putting more 
dogs on the streets in the ﬁ  rst place. 
Breeders, puppy mills, and even those 
families who do not adopt from shelters are all to blame for this killing cycle. We also must not forget about those owners who bite off more than they can chew when purchasing animals and often dump them wherever they ﬁ  nd convenient.
As a foster home, my family and I have 
had too many puppies come in and out of our house under such condi-tions. I can remember my fam-ily fostering dogs when I was just a kid. This summer alone, we have fostered ﬁ  ve dogs.
Meatball, a lovable black shih tzu mix, 
was found in Hale, Missouri. A friend of ours was contacted and picked him up be-fore he could be taken to a kill shelter. Piper and Bologna, two shepherd mixes, were advertised on a swap-and-shop Facebook page that said if they didn’t ﬁ  nd homes by the end of the day, they were going to be put down. Had we not found them ﬁ  rst, these 
puppies might have found themselves face-
to-face with death by lethal injection.
One reason the Humane Society reports 
that there are so many dogs ﬂ  ooding shel-ters all over the U.S. is because of low adop-tion rates. There are not enough people adopting dogs to balance out the number of dogs being rescued and put into shelters in the ﬁ  rst place.
According to a May 13 online article in 
the Topeka Capital-Journal, Kansas ranked second in highest number of breeders in the Humane Society’s census of dog breeder facility (puppy mill) violations out of 20 states. 
For those of you curious as to where pet 
stores get their dogs, puppy mills are your best bet. The article includes conditions 
such as dead rodents, severe matting of fur 
and excessive fecal matter.
I could talk your ear off about disgusting 
and cruel puppy mills, inhumane breeders looking to make an extra buck or bad ani-mal owners in general. But in order to make a big change, sometimes only the smallest step is needed. 
Visit your local shelter when thinking 
about purchasing your next pet. I know all of the puppies I ever fostered were given away for basically nothing, if money is ever a factor. Think of the hundreds of dollars you could save just by owning a mixed in-stead of a purebred dog. Don’t let man’s best friend be let down by a system that kills because there is no room.

Cornell now allows pro-
spective students to apply 
to their MBA program using 
their LinkedIn profiles, but 
UF won’t follow in those foot-steps.
The Samuel Curtis Johnson 
Graduate School of Manage-ment announced on July 8 that its redesigned application for the MBA program in New York will allow applicants to 
fill parts of the application us-
ing LinkedIn, such as employ-ment, education, demographic and contact information.
Applicants who use Linke-
dIn to fill out their application will give Cornell access to all other social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to 
cross-check information and 
get a better feel for their ap-plicants.
Director of the UF Masters 
of Arts in Mass Communica-tion Social Media Program, Andrew Selepak, said he thinks what makes the whole concept interesting is that the 
school basically admits they 
look up applicants on social media, but sometimes have a hard time finding them.
By connecting applications 
to LinkedIn, Cornell is letting students do some of the work for them, he said.
It wouldn’t be a good idea 
to use LinkedIn for under-graduate applications because LinkedIn isn’t geared toward high school students, Selepak 
said.
But if you knew that you 
were applying to grad school 
using your social media, you’d spend a lot more time trying to spruce it up, he said.
“For students in our 
MAMC program, I don’t have to push LinkedIn on them be-
cause they already have one,” 
Selepak said. “LinkedIn is a great tool for networking, finding jobs, making contacts and building those profes-
sional connections necessary 
to thrive professionally.”
However, Steve Orlando, 
UF spokesman, wrote in an 
email that UF has no plans to 
do anything like this.
Nina Cusmano, a 19-year-
old UF journalism sophomore, said she updates her LinkedIn profile once or twice a month 
to make sure her information 
is always accurate.
“I think it’s cool what Cor-
nell is doing, but it’s a lot of 
pressure to have everything 
perfect on your LinkedIn,” Cusmano said. “Giving them access to my LinkedIn means they’ll have access to every-
thing else.”
Cusmano said that her only 
concern would be the fact that 
Cornell will now be able to see 
applicants on all online plat-
forms and is concerned with whether or not it’s an invasion of social privacy.
“I know that I have to work 
on creating a more profes-sional online profile because I can’t be sure who is seeing my tweets nowadays, even when 
I think my profile might be on 
private,” she said.UF will not accept 
LinkedIn profiles as applications� IT WILL BE AUG. 22 AT 6:30 P.M.

Gainesville Police may not be worried about 
this type of crack hitting Gainesville’s streets. 
A local bicycle shop is hosting a nearly naked bike run to raise awareness of the visibility of cyclists and alternative transportation. 
The Critical Ass “Nearly Naked” Bike Ride 
will take place Aug. 22 at 6:30 p.m. The ride will begin at Pleasant Cyclery, located at 235 NW Eighth Ave., and it will end downtown. The route will be about 10 miles. 
Organizers decided to adopt the phrase, 
“Bare as much as you dare,” from the World Naked Bike Run and implement it into their event. However, participants must make sure to have all the appropriate parts covered to follow Florida law, which states that “it is un-lawful to expose or exhibit sexual organs in public.”
“This means berries and twig must be cov-
ered for the guys, bush and baby feeders for 
the ladies,” said Pleasant Cyclery bike pedaler 
Ryan Aulton. 
He said naked bike rides actually happen 
all over the world for the same reason. These events are known as World Naked Bike Rides and continue to expand every year. In the U.S., the first World Naked Bike Ride took place Portland, Oregon, in 2004. 
Those who choose to participate will help 
increase awareness of how vulnerable cyclists really are when sharing the road while also  riders are having fun. Taylor Cornillaud, a 20-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology senior, said she rides her bike everywhere through cam-pus and would be willing to participate in the Critical Ass bike run. 
“I think it’s a great way to raise awareness 
about sharing the road with bicycles,” Cornil-laud said. “There would be so many people 
turning heads and wondering what the riders 
are doing.”
Aulton said participants do not have to 
sign up, but should RSVP on the Facebook event page to show their support. He would also like participants, or those who support the cause, to share it with others. He said the more people they have, the more of an impact they will be able to make. 
People are welcome to come before the run 
starts to cover themselves in body paint if they 
would like to stand out even more during the 
event. Aulton plans on choosing a ride-after venue where participants can go and cele-brate.
There is a large cycling community in 
Gainesville, and Aulton hopes the event will demonstrate that people do not have to be de-pendent on oil and are capable of their own transportation. 
He hopes the event will grow in the future 
and would like to see it reach up to 1,000 par-ticipants, like other cities around the country.

MIAMI — A third judge in Flori-
da has overturned the state’s ban on 
same-sex marriage in a single coun-ty but stayed his decision Monday pending an appeal.
The ruling by Broward County 
Circuit Judge Dale Cohen mir-rors decisions made last month by judges in Monroe and Miami-Dade counties. 
All found that a 2008 voter-ap-
proved constitutional amendment banning gay marriage in the state violates gay residents’ right to equal 
protection under the law as guaran-
teed by the 14th Amendment.
Republican Attorney General 
Pam Bondi has filed a notice of ap-peal in the Monroe and Miami-Dade cases. No marriage licenses will be issued for gay couples in any of the three counties, pending appeals.
Heather Brassner, who wants to 
dissolve a civil union with an es-tranged partner in Vermont in 2002, petitioned for divorce in Broward County. Because Florida does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions, there was a question as to whether Cohen could grant the divorce.
Brassner’s attorney, Nancy 
Brodzki, said her client was elated by Cohen’s “thoughtful, eloquent decision.” Brodzki said she expect-ed Bondi to appeal this ruling as she has the other two before it. 
The attorney general’s spokes-
woman released a statement Mon-day saying Bondi’s office would 
review the ruling.
In his ruling, Cohen wrote that, 
“To discriminate based on sexual 
orientation, to deny families equali-ty, to stigmatize children and spous-es, to hold some couples less worthy of legal benefits than others based on their sexual orientation, to deny 
individuals tax credits, marital prop-
erty rights, the ability to dissolve their unions from other jurisdictions is against all that this country holds dear, as it denies equal citizenship. Marriage is a well-recognized fun-damental right, all people should be entitled to enjoy its benefits.”Gay-marriage opponents have 
said the rulings overturning the same-sex marriage ban would dis-enfranchise nearly 5 million voters 
in the state — the 62 percent who 
approved it. Repealing the amend-ment would require at least 60 per-cent support.
Republican Gov. Rick Scott has 
said he supports the gay-marriage ban amendment but opposes dis-crimination. His top Democratic challenger, former Gov. Charlie 
Crist, supports efforts to overturn 
the ban.
Nineteen states and the District of 
Columbia allow gay people to mar-ry. Bans that have been overturned in some other states continue to make their way through the courts.
Florida has long been a gay-
rights battleground. In the 1970s, singer and orange juice spokeswom-an Anita Bryant successfully cam-paigned to overturn a Dade County ordinance banning discrimination against gays. The county commis-sion reinstated those protections two decades later.
Another judge nixes gay marriage ban“There would be so many people 
turning heads and wondering what 
the riders are doing.”

Since 2008, Kurt Roper helped 
churn out four 1,000-yard pass 
catchers, two All-ACC wide re-
ceivers and three players topping Duke’s all-time career receptions 
list.
Coach Will Muschamp said 
there’s no such thing as an “add water, instant player,” but if Roper 
can at least plant the seed of pro-ductivity in the Gators’ receiving 
corps like he did with the Blue 
Devils, Florida fans could see some life from a position that hasn’t 
flourished in years.
In UF’s pro-style offense un-
der Muschamp, no receiver has 
recorded more than 600 yards in 
a single season. But Florida’s re-
ceiving problems go back beyond Muschamp.
Under Urban Meyer, only Riley 
Cooper came close to a 1,000-yard season when he caught 51 passes 
for 961 yards in 2009.
To find the Gators’ last 1,000-
yard pass catcher, you have to go 
back to the Rex Grossman and Ron Zook era. In 2002, Taylor Jacobs 
needed a 95-yard performance 
in the final regular-season game against Florida State in order to 
earn exactly 1,000 yards on the 
year.
Before Jacobs, Florida boasted 
at least one 1,000-yard receiver ev-ery year since 1995.
So why is it that the Gators have 
struggled at the wide receiver po-sition since then?
There is no one reason, but the 
biggest is that Florida consistently uses the ground attack more than the passing game. The last time UF 
had more passing attempts than 
rushing attempts was 2002.
Second, the Gators have missed 
out on the nation’s top receiv-ing talent in recent years. Javares McRoy and Ja’Juan Story were each 
four-star recruits in Muschamp’s 
first recruiting class, but they both transferred before playing a single snap for Florida.
Latroy Pittman, Jr. and Ra-
phael Andrades, each members of Muschamp’s 2012 recruiting class, 
were four and three-star players in 
high school, respectively. In their first two years in Gainesville, the 
duo has combined for just six re-
ceptions.
But with Roper installing a spread offense for 2014, the receiv-ing corps should have more open field to work with and Driskel 
should have more time to get his 
targets the ball.
“The great thing, we’ve got a 
lot of competition at the (wide re-
ceiver) position, so it’s going to 
make those guys work harder,” Muschamp said. “I think they have done a great job with Jeff (Driskel) and our quarterbacks this sum-mer. I’m excited to see those guys 
go out and compete. I certainly feel 
like we have improved ourselves at that position.”
Andre Debose is returning to 
the lineup after sitting out last year due to a torn ACL Now entering 
his sixth season at UF, Debose has 
one last chance to prove his worth at the collegiate level and is confi-
dent that Roper’s system is the one 
that will put him and the Gators over the top.
“Well I can tell you that in this 
offense there will be a lot of explo-sive plays,” he said. “It’ll be fun to 
watch. I can tell you, the fans, it’ll 
be really fun to watch.”
Austin Hardin is fighting 
to become the Gators starting kicker. Read about the position battles on page 16.

At the beginning of Flori-
da’s 2013 season, the expecta-
tions were high. The Gators were coming off of an 11-2, Sugar Bowl berth year. They 
entered the year as one of the 
favorites to win the Southeast-ern Conference Eastern Divi-sion and were even consid-ered by many as a dark horse national championship pick.
Fast forward just one year 
and the Gators are coming off of an injury-plagued 4-8 sea-
son — the program’s first los-
ing season since 1979.
Still at the helm in 
Gainesville is Will Muschamp, who heads into the year sit-
ting on one of the hottest seats 
in the country. Rather than shy away from it, Muschamp embraces the role wholeheart-edly.
“To stick your head in the 
sand and pretend it was all injuries, that’s not right. You will fool yourself if you be-
lieve that,” Muschamp said. 
“We’re getting ready to get started with the 2014 Florida football team.”
It’s been a busy offseason 
for UF, one that includes the hiring of offensive coordina-tor Kurt Roper from Duke as well as new offensive line 
coach Mike Summers. 
There was also the resigna-
tion of wide receivers coach 
and recruiting coordinator Muschamp remains 
confident in team despite ugly 2013

Injuries, players lined up in 
unfamiliar positions, a mountain-
sized tackle and a performance so poor it was replayed over and over again on Michael Sam’s draft 
highlight tape. All are unfortunate 
parts of Florida’s 2013 season, specifically its offensive line.
The offensive lineman is one 
of the most unique positions in all of organized sports. No position group is as much of a determin-er of offensive success without ever touching the ball — in fact 
there are rules expressly prevent-
ing them from touching the ball 
or even going down field. At its 
best, the offensive line under Will Muschamp is the sloberknocking group that bludgeoned LSU and Florida State late in crucial 2012 victories. At its worst, UF’s line acts like a revolving door allow-ing Missouri to rack up six sacks en route to a 36-17 loss.
Former center Jonotthan Har-
rison started every game last sea-son  — one of two UF offensive linemen to do so. In his place at the center position steps Max Gar-
cia. The redshirt senior from Nor-
cross, Ga. started seven games at left tackle and five at left guard. He’s the man tapped to replace Harrison, a bastion of consistency who had started 25 straight times at the position dating back to 2012.
“I wish I would have known 
I would have been playing cen-ter you know after he was gone. I would have paid attention a lot more,” Garcia said in jest. “He was always a hard worker, he was always just really locked in and focused. You could really always tell in his face, in his demeanor 
and the way he approached prac-
tice.”Summers breeze hopes 
to renew Florida O-line

focused on is approaching the po-
sition with conﬁ  dence, whether the protection he calls is right or wrong, it’s important to call it with 
conﬁ  dence to get his linemates be-
hind him and on the same page.
Now in his third position at Florida, Garcia is used to change, he’s now on his third offensive 
line coach in his ﬁ  ve-year colle-
giate career after the departure of Tim Davis from UF earlier in the spring. With Davis out, in steps Mike Summers, formerly of USC.
To a man, every offensive line-
man available at Florida media days described him as a techni-cian, and a product of the old school. He talks to the team about three-a-days and the old way of doing things, yet still can con-nect with players over 25 years his junior. And like every veteran 
coach, he’s full of stories about the 
way things used to be done.
“He told us one today about a 
quarterback that was apart of his team and wanting to get the best out of his players, Garcia said. “He said a coach took the quarter-back down to a lake and drowned his head in the water and the guy 
started freaking out and started 
ﬁ  ghting the coach and stuff like that, and (Summers) was like ‘that’s the kind of instinct that we need to have.’”
When Summers isn’t doling 
out anecdotes he’s drilling his linemen on technique. Redshirt junior Trip Thurman has been 
through two shoulder surgeries, 
and says Summers has helped him with hand placement more than anything else.
“I think a lot of issues that I’ve 
had with my shoulder was my hands were outside. If I can keep my hands outside I can be more powerful and more efﬁ  cient in my 
blocking,” Thurman said. “I nev-er pictured having two surgeries 
when I came here obviously, so 
it’s deﬁ  nitely something that I’m 
never taking for granted again. 
. . . There were times when they 
thought I wasn’t going to ever 
play again because my shoulder 
was so bad, so I’m taking every advantage I can.”
Under Summers, the Florida 
offensive line looks to improve its consistency, stay healthy and make a 180 degree turnaround from last year. If they don’t, the Gators run the risk of drowning 
just like they did in 2013.TUESDAY, AUGUST 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida’s summer not marred by off-ﬁ  eld disciplinary issues
Joker Phillips among alleged recruiting 
violations. Former Gator quarterback Chris Leak took over for Phillips in June.
From a player’s perspective, Muschamp 
has seen a new sense of buying into what 
he’s trying to do — something the head 
coach was praised for throughout the 2012 season. That’s not an easy thing to do when your team won just four games last season.
“From their work ethic, their buy-in.  We 
always talk in terms of either renting it or owning it,” Muschamp said. “You take own-ership in your team.  I see a lot of that.”While there has been a decent amount of 
news surrounding the program in the last eight months, the good news for Muschamp is that it has been one of the quietest off sea-sons in terms of disciplinary issues. One of the only issues to surface was 
early enrollee cornerback Jalen Tabor being cited with less than 20 grams of marijuana. The situation was dealt with internally and Tabor will not miss any time from fall camp or regular-season games from the incident.
“I think it goes back to recruiting, part of 
the evaluation process and taking the right guys,” Muschamp said. “They understand 
to stay within the lines of what we need to 
do and how they’re going to act and repre-sent the University of Florida.”   
It will be an uphill battle for the Gators in 
2014. Their schedule features a road trip to Alabama as early as Week 4, facing LSU and Missouri back-to-back at home and ﬁ  nishing off the regular season by traveling to Doak Campbell Stadium to face the defending na-tional champions Florida State.
In the SEC and at the University of Flor-
ida, there will be plenty of adversity to get past. Without making excuses, Muschamp puts on his bulletproof vest, ready to take the brunt of it all.
“You either get better or worse every 
day,” he said. “Embracing adversity, we’ll have adversity this year, when it’ll happen, I don’t know. Be in training camp, during the season at some point.  It’s going to hap-pen.”
MUSCHAMP , from page 13“He told us one today 
about a quarterback that 
was apart of his team and 
wanting to get the best 
out of his players. He said 
the (head) coach took the 
quarterback down to a lake

Head coach�DRISKEL WILL START AT QB.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Barring injury, Jeff Driskel will be Florida’s 
starting quarterback when the Gators make 
their season debut against Idaho on Aug. 30 in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
His understudy, on the other hand, is a roll 
still being auditioned for.
It could be Skyler Mornhinweg, the red-
shirt sophomore who has three career starts under his belt.
It could be Will Grier, the early enrollee 
who had 90 total touchdowns in his senior year at Davidson (N.C.) Day High and showed development during spring practice.
It could be Treon Harris, a true freshman 
and the third-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the 2014 class, according to Rivals.com.
But regardless of who earns the backup 
role, coach Will Muschamp made one prom-ise: He will play in some capacity against the Vandals.
“We’ve got to get another guy ready, and 
that’s what we plan on doing,” the fourth-
year coach said at UF’s media day on Sunday. 
“Who that will be, I don’t know. What sort of package we’ll have for them, I have no idea at this time.”
In 2011, Muschamp’s ﬁ  rst season at the 
helm of Gators football, he put Driskel into the spotlight with 6:04 remaining in the ﬁ  rst half of Florida’s season-opener against Florida Atlantic.
“We planned it going in,” Muschamp said. 
“We knew what we were going to do. We put him in the game.”
On his ﬁ  rst drive commanding the offense 
outside of practice, Driskel managed two rushes for 8 yards before landing a delay of game penalty and throwing an interception to Owls defensive back Marcus Bartels.
But the Oviedo, Fla., native redeemed him-
self on his second drive. Re-entering the game with 8:01 left on the clock, Driskel went 4 of 5 for 42 yards on Florida’s ﬁ  nal drive of the game.
Youth encompasses secondary: UF has 14 
defensive backs on its roster for 2014.
Of those 14, sophomore Vernon Har-
greaves, III is the only one with double-digit starts in his career.
But the lack of starting experience doesn’t phase Muschamp.
“I’ll take talent over experience any day,” 
he said.
The Gators have multiple combinations 
that they can implement this year in the sec-ondary, with Hargreaves, junior Brian Poole and true freshmen Jalen Tabor, J.C. Jackson, Duke Dawson and Quincy Wilson ﬁ  ghting for time at the cornerback spots.
Muschamp also noted that senior Jabari 
Gorman, redshirt sophomore Marcus Maye, sophomore Keanu Neal and redshirt fresh-men Marcell Harris and Nick Washington are vying for time at safety.
“Those guys are a good carry over,” he 
said. “Jalen Tabor did some nice things. Duke did some nice things. Duke’s a guy we played at the nickel a little in the spring, can play some different positions. He gives you a dif-ferent skillset as far as a bigger guy — good blitzer, good instincts.”
Kicking job “open”: The Gators connected 
on just 12 of 22 ﬁ  eld-goal attempts in 2013. That 54.5-percent conversion rate was 13th in the 14-team Southeastern Conference.
Even worse, UF only landed one of its eight 
kicks through the uprights from farther than 40 yards one year after going 8 of 9 from at least 40 yards out.
Austin Hardin is currently the frontrunner 
for the starting job. Despite going 4 of 12 in ﬁ  eld goal attempts in 2013 and missing six of his ﬁ  nal seven attempts, Hardin showed im-provement during the Orange & Blue Debut, converting all four of his ﬁ  eld goals.
“It’s open,” Muschamp said, “but I have 
lot more conﬁ  dence (in Hardin) coming out of spring, and especially the spring game as opposed to maybe going into spring.”
The punting game struggled as well, with 
the Gators ending the season 11th in the con-ference with a 40.9-yard average per punt, almost four yards less than a year before.
Kyle Christy — a ﬁ  nalist for the 2012 Ray 
Guy Award that honors the best punter in college football — and Johnny Townsend are battling for the starting punter position.
“Over a period of time, you begin to 
build your conﬁ  dence back,” Muschamp said, “and I think those guys have done that and it started in the spring.”
