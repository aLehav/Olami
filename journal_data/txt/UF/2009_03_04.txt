As lawmakers started the 
spring legislative session Tuesday, 
they were joined by lobbyists from around the state, including about six of UF’s own lobbyists.]
Those six are part of a team of 
11 lobbyists employed by UF on 
the federal and state level to help 
shore up funds for research proj-ects and other causes near and dear to the university.
On the federal side of things, 
UF was one of almost 300 colleges, 
universities and other educational groups in 2008 that spent over $100 
million on federal lobbying for the first time since the Center for Re-sponsive Politics began compiling numbers in 1998. In 2008, UF used 
BGR Group, the same lobbying group as Abercrombie & Fitch, Lockheed Martin and Pfizer, ac-
cording to the center
From 1998 to 2008, UF’s federal lobbying expenses climbed from $80,000 a year to $240,000, hitting a 
peak of $300,000 in 2005, according to the center’s database on opense-crets.org.Those numbers don’t tell 
the whole story, though.

Two men lounging at the Patrol Divi-
sion front desk said I was in for some good 
stories that night. 
“He’s going to tell you stories about the war,” the man wearing a baseball cap joked. 
“What war?” his friend asked. 
“The Civil War.” The baseball-cap wear-
er grinned.
As if on cue, an older gentleman in uni-
form strolled out of the back room and in-troduced himself as Officer Ray Metrick. 
He had a gray mustache, and his gentle 
face was etched with laugh 
lines. 
As he ushered me out of the 
chipped and weathered brick 
building on UF’s campus, 40-degree wind hit our cheeks, reddening them instantly. I 
was accompanying Metrick on a five-hour 
patrol for the University Police Depart-ment, where we would scour  campus for law breakers and mischief mongers. The

Tuesday night’s back-to-
back Student Senate meetings 
were filled with tearful good-
byes and words of encourage-ment, as old senators left and new senators sat through their 
first meeting.
Independent Sen. Audrey 
Goldman and Gator Sen. Su-
zanne Hershman were chosen as the new Senate president and Senate Pro-tempore, re-spectively, following the de-
parture of Senate President 
Jordan Johnson, who was elected as UF’s next Student Body president last week.
Between goodbyes, sena-
tors also got down to business, passing one bill and one reso-lution. 
The bill, which passed 
unanimously, gave $35,130.86 to the Board of College Coun-cils, which is responsible for divvying up funds and distrib-
uting them among various col-
lege councils on campus.The passed resolution was 
in support of Gator Ride, a stu-dent organization that hopes to provide transportation to UF 
students around Gainesville 
who are unable to drive re-sponsibly because of alcohol consumption. 
A resolution is a piece of 
legislation which presents an opinion but takes no action. 
Gator Ride was denied 
funding from the Senate sev-eral weeks ago because of li-ability issues. 
A copy of the resolution 
will be sent to Tigert Hall and 
given to UF’s General Council 
to access, before SG reconsid-
ers allotting funding.  
Jared Hamil was also ap-
proved to fill the empty Dis-trict E seat.  
Stephen Lawson, chairman 
of SG’s Elections Commission, also stopped by to validate the 
results from last week’s SG 
election, which included the results for Student Body presi-dent and the 50 filled Student Old senators give

Man arrested after crashing car into house, fleeing scene
A man was arrested after he crashed his car into the side of a 
house Tuesday night.
At about 10:30 p.m. a Gainesville police officer attempted to 
pull over a black Cadillac STS for a traffic violation said GPD Sgt. 
Stephen Hayes.
Hayes said instead of pulling over, the man sped up, losing 
control of his car and crashing it into the house at 1202 NW 4th Ave. The man crawled out of the passenger side of the car and ran north, but the officer caught him, Hayes said. 
The man was carrying crack, Hayes said.

Obama was “cooking the books” in rosy recovery predictions.
After being accused for weeks 
of being too negative about the economy, Obama recently has 
shifted to a more positive tone. 
He and his aides still say recovery won’t come quickly, but they are becoming more aggressive in de-claring that the government’s ef-forts will work.
They had better work, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said.
The country faces “a prolonged 
episode of economic stagnation” without bold policy moves, he told the Senate Banking Committee.
Separately, the Fed announced 
a long-awaited program to spur lending for autos, education, credit cards and other consumer loans by providing up to $200 billion in fi-
nancing to investors to buy up the 
debt.
If the program succeeds, it 
should help break economy-crippling credit clogs and make it easier for Americans to finance purchases large and small at lower rates, Bernanke said.
“What the economy requires, 
what the American people de-mand is that we move as aggres-sively as we can to get growth back on track,” Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

 Progress Energy, which sells electricity to 
UF, has requested a decrease in electric rates 
that could soften UF’s budget cut by between 
$2 million and $3 million, according to Matt 
Fajack, UF’s chief ﬁ  nancial ofﬁ  cer.
The request must still be approved by Florida’s Public Service Commission. It 
would go into effect for the April billing cycle.Tim Leljedal, a spokesman for Prog-ress Energy, said the company requested the rate cuts because fuel prices have come down and because it decided to postpone some charges for a nuclear power plant be-ing built in Levy County.
The proposed rate decrease follows a few 
other decreases in UF’s original utilities pro-jections for the current ﬁ  scal year.
UF factored in about $10 million for in-
creases in its utility bills into the potential $72 million to $75 million budget cut that UF President Bernie Machen announced in January, Fajack 
said. 
With the proposed rate decrease and oth-
er developments, the size of that cut is now expected to be about $5.5 million, he said.
The increases in utilities would normally 
be paid by the state, which pays utilities for UF’s educational buildings.
This year, the state didn’t pick up the tab 
for the extra costs. 
And it may not shell out the money next 
ﬁ  scal year either, so UF is still factoring about $11 million for next year’s increases into the potential budget cut, Fajack said. Utility rate decrease could mean fewer UF budget cuts By KATIE EMMETS

 The ﬁ  rst Alachua County Gov-
ernment large-scale solar panel project was unveiled Tuesday.
There are now 128 solar panels 
at the Leveda Brown Environmen-tal Park, said Ron Bishop, Alachua County solid waste engineer.
The energy provided by the 
panels will be sold to Gainesville Regional Utilities for 32 cents a kilowatt-hour under the new feed-
in tariff bill that was implemented 
March 1. 
“By the end of the year, 
Gainesville will have produced twice as much energy as the entire 
state,” he said.
Bishop said that the park expects the panels to produce enough en-
ergy to power three or four houses per day. 
Bishop said he started thinking 
about ways to use alternative en-ergy more than 25 years ago, but because it was too expensive he 
didn’t begin thinking realistically 
about it until four years ago.
“Sunlight is free,” he said. “It’s 
delivered to your door without any shipping and handling fees.” LOCALCounty unveils ﬁ  rst

Although they clearly have their 
differences, there is one thing all 
candidates for the Gainesville City 
Commission can agree on: spending 
must be cut.
“We have a deficit right now, 
and we need to be looking for ways to cut back, not ways to spend more money,” said At-Large 1 candidate Robert Krames at a forum Tuesday night.
Krames, along with the six 
other candidates running for the Gainesville city commission, spoke to about 40 people in a Gainesville commission candidate forum.
Two city commission seats, Dis-
trict 1 and At-Large 1, are up for re-election March 24.
Tuesday’s forum was held at the 
Alachua County downtown library 
at 401 E. University Ave.
A major point of discussion was 
what to do in these tough economic 
times.
District 1 Commissioner Scher-
win Henry spoke about the need to diversify the local economy and at-tract industry to Gainesville.
Henry cited the green jobs that 
will be generated by the new solar 
feed-in tariff as an example of suc-
cess.
Gainesville is the first city in the 
U. S. to implement a solar feed-in tariff, which pays citizens for solar energy production.Marcia Wimberly, Henry’s chal-
lenger for the District 1 seat, said 
it would be wiser to help existing 
Gainesville businesses.
“I actually would like to see re-
tention of the businesses we have, because many of them are closing,” Wimberly said.“The mom-and-pop businesses 
are still the No. 1 employers,” she 
added.
Wimberly suggested implement-
ing additional tax credits and creat-
ing new-business incubators to help struggling Gainesville businesses.
The candidates for the At-Large 1 commission seat also voiced opin-ions on how to handle the city’s fis-
cal pains.
Krames emphasized the need to 
cut back on unnecessary city ser-
vices, potentially merging similar services with the county.
Tom Cunilio, also running for the At-Large 1 seat, also called for an end to wasteful city spending.
“I’m amazed at the money we 
throw around,” he said. 
At-Large 1 incumbent Jeanna 
Mastrodicasa suggested a freeze on raises and a reduction on the num-ber of projects. 
Another of Mastrodicasa’s chal-
lengers, James Schlachta, said the city must decide what projects are important and what can be cut.
“There are some things that 
we will just not be able to fund,” Schlachta said.
Another hotly debated issue on 
the ballot was Charter Amendment 
1, which would remove legal protec-
tion against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identi-ty. Both District 1 candidates, Henry and Wimberly, voiced disapproval of the amendment.
“As a city commissioner, I must 
protect all the citizens of Gainesville,” Henry said.
Among the At-Large 1 candi-
dates, all but Mastrodicasa are for it.
“I’m a very conservative person,” 
said At-Large 1 candidate Richard Selwach. “I’m an advocate for a tra-ditional marriage and family.”
Selwach said he has spoken to 
women and children that have ex-pressed concern about the possibility 
of men using women’s restrooms.
“They’re telling me that they 
don’t want men in the bathroom,” 
Selwach said. “I’m going to support those women and children.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009

After this week, it may not be 
long before blogs and Wikis be-
come regular parts of the UF cur-riculum. 
Today, a committee will fin-
ish reviewing new-and-improved E-Learning systems, which will include more up-to-date features 
than the current system. 
E-Learning is UF’s curriculum 
management system, which allows 
professors to teach all or parts of their courses online. 
“Part of what we’re looking for 
as we’re looking for a new system is a way to get to new technologies 
and put them into the hands of 
teachers and students to enhance learning. That’s what it’s all about,” said Doug Johnson, the manager of 
E-Learning Support Services.
It is likely that UF would have 
switched to a newer course man-
agement system soon anyway, but a pressing matter sped the process 
along, Johnson said. 
Vista, the vendor which sup-
ports UF’s current course man-
agement system and branded E-
Learning at UF, announced last fall 
that as of October 2011 it would no longer support the program. 
A 17-member committee com-prised of 12 faculty members from different UF departments and five online program support employ-ees was established to evaluate different systems used by peer in-
stitutions.
During the past year, the com-
mittee has reviewed three possible 
systems. 
UF has been using a course management system since 1997. 
The Vista version has been in use 
since 2003. 
Johnson said the current sys-
tem, which has 30,000 live sections 
this semester, functions well, but 
each of the three new systems will allow instructors to do more. For example, improved tools in all of the considered systems will allow 
teachers to more easily build tests 
and quizzes online.
“I don’t know whether students 
are going to particularly like that 
or not,” Johnson said.
Other features will cater to stu-
dents and professors, such as a 
class blog to make learning more interactive.
While the committee hopes to 
make a recommendation to the chief information officer by the end of March, Johnson said it is 
unclear when the new system will 
be implemented. 
With the current budget situa-
tion, it may be more cost effective to renew the Vista contract for 2010 
and save the costs of installing the 
new system for 2011. Johnson said he would like to have the system installed by August 2010. 
“That’s one of those funding 
issues,” he said. “If we’re given funding to get enough staff, we can definitely make the move.”ON CAmpUS

Joanne is a lesbian firefighter.She protects all Gainesville citizens equal-
ly, she says through the TV screen.
And she asks that on March 24, voters 
allow Gainesville to do the same by voting “no” on Amendment 1.
The commercial is one of two by Equality 
is Gainesville’s Business, which will hit cable channels today and run until the election.
The same commercials will air Thursday 
on network TV, including WCJB TV-20 and the CW.
“I could be fired from my job, or denied 
a home, for no other reason than my sexual orientation,” Joanne says of Amendment 1 in the commercial.
The amendment would nullify Chapter 
8 of the Gainesville Code of Ordinances, titled “Discrimination.” Instead, protections would be provided by the Florida Civil Rights Act at the state level. In effect, this would remove protected status for transgen-der, lesbian, gay and bisexual Gainesville 
residents and loosen protec-tions for other classes.
The second commercial 
features a group of eight peo-
ple, each providing a few words to an over-all message against the amendment.
A UF student, a reverend and Michael 
Bowie, the president of the local branch of the National Association for the Advance-ment of Colored People, speak in the com-mercial.
“The NAACP, for a long time, has fought 
discrimination and is opposing Amendment 1,” Bowie said.
Craig Lowe, a city commissioner and 
founder of Equality, declined to comment on the commercial’s cost. As of February 13, Equality raised $59,015, the most money of any political action committee in Gaines-ville’s history, according to the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections.

The 28 photos displayed on the 
wall of the Reitz Union show the 
faces and lives of people who, ac-
cording to some, often face adver-sity in society.
The photos, which depict the 
lives of Muslims, were taken as 
part of a nationwide photography 
project called Unseen America and will be on display until Monday. 
Liz Gottlieb, the coordinator of 
UF’s exhibit, said the project first started in New York City, when immigrant workers were prompt-ed to start documenting their lives through photography. 
Now the project is used by mi-
nority groups who have had to fight stereotypes and prejudice in the past, she said.  
The five UF students who took 
the photos were all members of Islam on Campus and hoped to dispel the different stereotypes placed on Muslim-Americans in a 
post-Sept. 11 society. 
The pictures display different 
aspects of the photographers’ lives, 
using family and friends as muses. 
Many center on the Islamic reli-
gion showing moments of prayer and time spent in celebration dur-ing various Islamic holidays. 
“Overall we wanted to show 
that Muslims are like everyone else,” said UF graduate student Muhsin Aziz Ahmad.
Although Ahmad, who is 
studying food science and human 
nutrition, said he was an amateur 
when it came to photography, he carried his camera with him every-where in case he came across the 
perfect moment.
He said he went “picture cra-
zy,” taking about 1,000 pictures 
between August and December before he found the six pictures he wanted to submit.
Aziz, who said his theme was 
family, took many pictures of his father, who is a doctor.
Asaad Musda, a UF graduate 
student studying electrical engi-
neering, said he has always been 
interested in photography and saw the project as a way to show off his skill as well as the daily lives as Muslims.
“There is a basic stereotype that 
Muslims are terrorists,” he said.
Graduate student Mohammad–
Eslam Mohammed agreed.“People usually see our religion 
as violent and full of hatred,” he said.
Mohammed hoped to break this 
myth by showing pictures of Mus-lims celebrating Eid, the holiday that signifies the end of Ramadan and fasting. 
“They’re greeting one another 
warmly,” he said.Photo exhibit aims to curb stereotypes of Muslims

OPINIONS EDITORNo news isn’t necessarily good news.
When the Editorial Board sits down each day to go over fod-
der for the next day’s editorial, we usually have a few strange, funny or otherwise relevant news stories to choose from.  
We try not to focus on trivial news or ignore big issues, espe-
cially when they impact UF students in some way.
But today, when we were scouring national headlines trying 
to find something to opine on, it became apparent that either 
nothing interesting happened today, or the United States has become completely ignorant of what’s actually going on in the world.
CNN.com, an otherwise reputable news source, has the op-
tion of ranking stories by popularity.
The most popular headline? “Sexy tot mom pics!”
Following that are stories about Michael Jackson, the televi-
sion show “Wife Swap,” an asteroid perched precariously close 
to the Earth and a few missing person and plane crash stories that the cable news is currently obsessing over.
To be fair, a story about President Barack Obama overturn-
ing a Bush law that weakened the Endangered Species Act is also high up on the list, but that’s the only story pertaining to national or world issues out of the ten.
This ignorance is nothing new – scholars have published 
several journal articles on the concept of “American privilege” – the idea that Americans feel that they can disregard the rest of the world just because they sit in a position of power and relative wealth. American high school students don’t know a world map from a hole in the ground, and UF students prob-ably know more about drink specials  in midtown on Wasted Wednesday than about U.S. foreign or economic policy, let alone international relations.
News is digested in bullet points and sound bites, which gels 
with the fast pace of our society. Americans want their news now, and they want it on computers, BlackBerrys and Kindles alongside broadsheet newsprint.
Opposing technology is nothing less than curmudgeonly, 
and the Editorial Board embraces the positive effect the Internet has had on journalism and storytelling.
But in breaking up the news by story, people can read ex-
actly what they want to read and disregard the rest. 
Unfortunately, most of the time people would rather read 
stories about kittens being stuffed in smoky bongs (also on CNN.com’s top 10 list) than Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s recent envoy in Israel.
And the current crisis in the journalism industry doesn’t 
bode well for in-depth investigative stories or international per-spectives.
As more and more great papers like the Rocky Mountain 
News close their doors, fallen victim to the faltering economy and years of negative revenue, people will become less and less 
informed.
They will get their news from several national online sources 
like CNN.com, and small yet significant issues will go unno-
ticed.
Newspapers exist to serve the community. They are charged 
with exposing corruption and keeping local government offi-cials honest. Local newspapers are already struggling to keep reporters on staff to cover crucial local issues like City Com-mission meetings, and predictions for the future are less than bright.
As more news moves online, many will give up their morn-
ing newspaper-and-breakfast rituals. Maybe they’ll skip break-
fast altogether and just head in to work, where they can browse 
PerezHilton.com from the safety of their cubicles. But one thing is certain: As more newspapers go under, Americans will be-come less informed, and a great service to society will be lost.

Body image issues transcend ‘Barbie’Column
170 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Do you own a 
pair of jorts?Tuesday’s question: Are you go -
ing to Mexico for Spring Break?12% YES88% NOBefore Carrie Bradshaw, there was Barbara Millicent Roberts. She turns 50 years old this week, and she’s never looked better.
You may know her as Barbie — that doll with flaw-
less skin, the toy that never has to excuse herself to the little doll’s room to touch up her eyeliner or lipstick, the one with the feet that come stiletto-ready. In five decades, she’s managed to have over one hundred careers, each one with its own accessories. She even has her own pinked-out aisle in the toy stores.
I have to admit: I’m impressed.
Barbie is the doll America loves to hate. Feminists have 
held dear their right to blast the half-inch-shy-of-a-foot-
tall toy, blaming her for low self-esteem and eating disor-ders among girls.
All that blame can’t be placed on her tiny shoulders, 
though.
The problem is that it’s almost too easy to blame Barbie 
for negative body images. We’re a society that just loves to blame others for our problems, and it doesn’t matter who takes the blame — so long as we don’t have to answer for our own shortcomings.
I grew up with the support of strong, encouraging 
women who embody what I believe Barbie stands for, not as a fashionista, but rather as a strong feminine icon that has stood the test of time. 
Family members, friends, even teachers: The people we 
interact with on a regular basis are who shape our self-im-ages in the end, not some molded piece of plastic covered in pink frills.
A scene from “Mean Girls” comes to mind, where the 
Plastics are standing in front of a mirror pointing out their flaws. When they get to Cady Heron, all she can say is “I have really bad breath in the morning.”One can look at the char-
acter of the head Plastic, Re-gina George, and draw links between her and Barbie: the dream house, expensive car and huge wardrobe — but Bar-bie never wistfully sighs, wish-ing her thighs had a little less jiggle to them or saying that her hairline looks weird. Therein lies the problem with the “girl 
world.” It’s okay to want to 
spend a day in Barbie’s teeny-tiny shoes, but the obsession 
with perfection goes way beyond a doll.
Yes, I’ve skipped meals before. And yes, I’ve also stood 
in front of a mirror analyzing everything I disliked about 
myself (huge pores and sucky nail beds included). It took 
a while before I realized how harmful that negativity was, 
and perhaps I am still grappling with the issue of my body image. Many girls are, whether they play with Barbie dolls or not.
Let’s give Barbie a break. She has had her superficial 
shortcomings along the way, but she’s managed to stay classy since her 1959 debut in a black-and-white striped swimsuit. Instead of shouting about how sexist her body proportions are, how about we work to use positive rein-forcement to boost the body images of those around us?
But as we head out for Spring Break, perhaps we should 
all embrace the Barbie within us. Ladies, go out and flaunt what your mommas gave you.
Save the negativity for that term paper due on the 
16th.

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 7
When you throw a festival of some 
sort, typically it is supposed to be in a location that has something to do 
with what the festival is about. 
Like Coffee Week in Seattle or Mugging 
Week in Detroit. Things synonymous with that city. 
This must be the logic, then, behind the first 
annual Gainesville Fashion Week. Because Lord knows, when I think haute couture, the first place that comes to mind is North Central Florida.
Now, I understand that some of the party 
promoters here in Gainesville like to try to 
give our little college town the occasional up-
scale vibe. This is why I am constantly getting Facebook invitations to events claiming to be “High Society,” while the next sentence tells me there are $2 shots of Old Crow if I go be-fore 11. But honestly, folks, Fashion Week? That’s kind of like having West Virginia Cul-ture Week or the Utah Diversity Festival. Out-side of a handful of kids I’ve met here from Miami and our inexplicable Long Island trans-plant population, I haven’t met a whole lot of people in Gainesville who could tell a Prada loafer from a ProWing.
So given the fact that our city has about as 
much fashion sense as an emu double-fisting handles of Jack Daniels, one has to ask, “What exactly is Gainesville Fashion Week going to entail?”
I mean, a seven-day collection of No. 15 jer-
seys and Urban Meyer gameday polos doesn’t exactly constitute a Fashion Week. Nor does bringing in models to sport whatever Tim 
Tebow fellatio the university has decided 
would look good on a T-shirt. Heidi Klum rocking “The Promise”? I’m thinking cover of next month’s Vogue. And really, can any town that has more jean shorts per capita than it does cell phones really be mentioned next to the word “fashion”? Even if it could, you really think all the A-list designers are immediately going to start em-bracing the monu-mental regression in fashion that is 
the jort? I don’t even think there’s a word for it 
in Italian. It’s too horrific a thought.
Why do I get the feeling that a year from 
now we’re not going to be seeing models strut-
ting through Miami in $1,000 Versace jorts and a pair of Cavalli flip-flops?  Why am I thinking  that “frat boy couture” is not going to be the next big thing in Milan? 
“Hello, Harry? This is Salvatore Ferraga-
mo.  How soon can we come out with a line 
of T-shirts from frat parties that happened 
two years ago? That long? OK, what about leg warmers and Uggs? Think we can do that faster? I have to get on this before de la Renta, or we’ll be a laughingstock next month in New York.”
Perhaps someone is hoping Vera Wang 
will decide to come out with a line of blue and orange sundresses, who knows? 
Maybe this will be the start of something 
big. Maybe Donna Karan will see the fashion revolution that is the jean short and decide to set up shop at Oaks Mall right between the 
beauty supply store and Gator Mania. Maybe 
Gucci will follow suit and open a location next to Balls. And maybe those expensive ads with shop locations on the bottom will someday read “Rodeo Drive, Bal Harbour, Butler Pla-za.” But somehow, I doubt it. 
Somehow I think this column is really more 
of a collection of all the jokes that have been going through everyone’s heads since they 
heard the term “Gainesville Fashion Week.” 
Whoever is promoting this, I appreciate 
your effort. But maybe next time take a clue 
from the people who tried to promote Ohio Championship Month, and pick something a little more appropriate.

Speaking Out
Gym’s weight room not just for men
Joshua Nederveld is a chauvinistic, pea-for-a-
brain, wannabe meathead. As a woman who regu-
larly uses the bench (with her measly 70 pounds), 
I am outraged by his delusional “unwritten laws” 
of the weight room.
Nederveld and gym bros like him need to stop 
comparing their paltry triceps in the mirror wall 
and take a good look around. He needs to realize 
that not all women are the 2.5 pound-lifting, nail-breaking, elliptical-revolving girls he so eloquent-ly speaks of. Sure those girls can be annoying, but I can name plenty of others who squat just as much 
as most guys. 
Every member of the Student Body contributes 
funding to Rec Sports through the activities fee. 
Therefore, women — pretty girls and tomboys 
alike — have an equal “right and privilege” to 
use the “good” side of the gym as do the goril-las. As far as Nederveld’s unsubstantial comments about the gym music selection, don’t be fooled. I am quite sure he is guilty of knowing more than 
a few of the words to “Since You’ve Been Gone” 
(and liking it). 
Listening to endless amounts of Rage Against 
the Machine while curling 30s won’t make him 
more of a man. If Nederveld simply can’t stand 
the mood Akon puts him in, I have one simple tip for the beefcake — get an iPod, and while he’s at it, a life, so he can find something better to do than rag on the ladies in the weight room who he and 
his puny pecs don’t stand a chance with.

I was once informed that the only way to 
gain a clear understanding of a political group or a movement is to hear what one 
of their die-hard partisans has to say on the subject. 
A liberal, even when trying to be objec-
tive, will mischaracterize a conservative and vice versa — but let one of a group’s very own firebrands take the stage and then you begin to find out what they’re really about. Such instances are guaranteed to be entertain-ing, if not educational, and one occurred very recently at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a meeting of conservative lumi-
naries that parallels the worst excesses of the 
Chautauqua tent.
Since the Obamanon, the conservative 
movement has been experiencing a malaise — Sean Hannity has even gone so far as to open his show with the proclamation of “Conserva-tism in Exile!” Clearly, these lost souls need a leader. So, which firebrand rose to the occa-sion and gave an impassioned (and more than twice as long as allotted) speech in defense of conservatism? 
None other than the current poster-boy of 
the conservative movement, Rush “The Dop-er” Limbaugh. The radio personality called out the president during his speech, thunder-ing “President Obama: Your agenda is not new, it’s not change and it’s not hope.” It goes without saying that this remark was well-received. Limbaugh’s speech can give some valid insight into the current incarnation of the conservative movement. 
For example, an uncomfortable amount of 
his speech was dedicated to that old pastime of his: self-aggrandizement. He even included a painfully unfunny joke about how God likes to imagine that he’s Rush Limbaugh. Addi-tionally, the luminary pointed out to his some-what jangled audience that he believes Presi-dent Barack Obama has the power to de-stroy the conservative movement. 
Limbaugh’s speech 
was heavy on criti-cism and hysterics, but weak on ideas. This, to me, seems to be the primary prob-lem with the current conservative move-
ment. The loss of powers so long enjoyed and so poorly used seems to have unhinged them 
a bit and reduced today’s conservative move-
ment to a histrionic, spiteful gang of children.
There is, undoubtedly, a power vacuum 
in the conservative movement as it exists and the GOP in general.  Gov. Bobby Jindal, it was hoped, would be able to step up to the plate as the Republican answer to Obama, but his speech went over about as well as Limbaugh’s draft-dodging at a meeting of the Vietnam Veterans of America. Gov. Sarah Palin, against all logic, is performing well in current polls, but the idea of Palin 2012 is a joke and most 
conservatives know it. With no one to fill the 
shoes which are feeling increasingly empty since the days of Reagan, naturally the conser-vatives are paying some heed to the bold and confident Limbaugh. 
They would do well to practice caution, 
however, as this particular pied piper might very well lead them off a cliff and actually suc-ceed in destroying the movement. For their 
own sake, conservatives need to hitch their 
outdated covered wagon to a figure more in-terested in ideas and less in…well…himself. 
And preferably one who has never referred 
to Obama as a “magic negro.”

When thinking of the Civil Rights Move-
ment, Gainesville doesn’t immediately 
come to mind. 
But “Freedom Ride 2008,” a 25-minute 
documentary that surveys Alachua Coun-
ty’s Civil Rights Movement, proves that 
Gainesville played an important role. 
The documentary will air three times 
per day on Alachua County’s Community 
12 Television through mid-March. The doc-
umentary aired in early February for Black History Month. 
Community 12 TV producer Alan Yeat-
ter said the station has done special pro-gramming for Black History Month since 
2005. Yeatter said he saw the re-dedication 
of the Gainesville bus depot in Rosa Parks’ 
honor as the perfect opportunity for this 
year’s filming.
“It’s important to understand our his-
tory so we have a better understanding of our present,” he said.
The film opens with Alachua residents 
singing and clapping to the word “free-dom” as they ride a Regional Transit Sys-tem bus with same word flashing on a dis-play at the front of the bus.
Leslie Cosby, Gainesville High School’s 
first African American teacher, said it’s im-
portant for younger genera-tions to understand what hap-
pened during the ‘50s and’60s. 
“If you have no idea what’s 
going on, then you don’t realize the oppor-tunities you have because of what someone 
else sacrificed,” she said.
 “It’s nice to know both sides of the 
coin,” she said.
Yeatter said that because Gainesville has a large student population and sees a lot of people coming and going, the area’s history 
may not be widely known. 
“People might think of the civil rights 
movement in more national terms without 
really thinking about what things were like 
within our own community,” he said. 
According to Cosby, experiencing the 
Civil Rights Movement in Gainesville was different than it would have been in a big 
city because of the tight-knit community 
developed by UF. 
“Gainesville is a unique town,” she said. 
“Always has been, always will be.”Documentary on civil rights struggle airs this month

Gainesville residents are giv-
ing positive feedback on a cus-
tomer service call center hot line 
in which people can learn about applying for food stamps. 
The line was funded by a 
$14,973 allocation from the Ala-
chua County Board of Commis-
sioners. 
The Department of Children 
and Families added the hot line 
to their list of services,  said 
Lynn Dann, an operations man-agement consultant for the de-partment.
Contacting the  center is the 
only way to ask about food stamp benefits. The hot line is for all calls, not just those about applications, she said.  It is the 
only county-funded line in Flor-
ida, Dann said.Before the hot line, 24 per-
cent of people who called were waited on, and 55 percent of those eligible for benefits got them, according to a press re-
lease from the County Manag-
er’s office. 
Dann said the department ad-
vertised for the hot line to reach 
people who haven’t had to apply before and might be hesitant to go to the center in person.
It’s too early for updated 
statistics, but Dann said the hot 
line has been popular.
About 600 people have 
registered for food stamp ap-plications since the hot line’s launch.
“Unfortunately, many are 
eligible,” she said.
The department is sched-
uled to display the results of the service to the Alachua County Commissioner’s office in April.LOCAL NEWSHot line offers help

night festivities.
As soon as I slid into the passenger’s 
seat of the patrol car and attempted to 
warm my hands, we were winding down 
Museum Road, and he began to share his 17 years in law enforcement with me. Dur-ing casual conversation, he carefully moni-tored the positions of the other officers on 
duty on his computer screen, making sure 
his patrol car wasn’t far from them in case they ran into an emergency situation. 
“I always was with a good team,” he 
said. “I knew that someone had my back.” 
The recent career switch from covering 
narcotics and violent crimes with different law enforcement teams in South Florida to 
patrolling a college campus hasn’t fazed 
him at all.  
“I’m new, and they’ve been very good to 
me,” he said, grasping the steering wheel.      
Metrick, 57, has been with UPD for 
about 10 months, but his almost 20 years 
of adrenaline rushes and team training put 
him on par with seasoned UPD officers. He was on the road Friday night with officers who have put in the same amount of time 
into UPD that he has with various agencies 
across Florida. He holds a certain respect for officers 
who have stayed with UPD for almost two decades. 
Officers who have been in law enforce-
ment for many years have formed a trust that mentally assures everyone they are go-ing to go home safely after the shift ends. 
That connection with his fellow officers 
kept Metrick alert late Friday night as he intently listened to the outdoor festivities through his open car window, even though the temperatures were in the 30s.  
After about 15 minutes of waiting in 
his patrol car near Fraternity Drive, a yel-low Ford Escape zoomed past a stop sign, oblivious to Metrick’s presence in the shadows.
He shifted into drive and sped after the 
guilty driver, who kept hitting the brake lights out of nervousness. The patrol car’s red and blue lights flickered and reflected off “It is Unlawful to Feed the Alligators” 
signs posted by Lake Alice. 
After both cars were parked in the right-
hand lane on Museum Road, Metrick ex-
ited the car with calm and collected pro-fessionalism, and he strolled over to the 
driver’s side window.
After issuing a ticket for an expired reg-
istration instead of running the stop sign, 
Metrick scooted back into his vehicle and added a copy of the ticket to a collection shoved in the sun visor. 
“Both students stuck out their hands 
and thanked me for bringing it to their at-
tention,” he said. “I felt like I was getting 
through to them and that something was accomplished.” 
Patrolling with compassion
Other UPD veterans who have been a 
part of the Patrol Division have also turned these types of positive interactions with 
students and Gainesville residents into im-
portant career memories.
UPD Lt. Stacy Ettel sat in his chair back 
at the UPD Administration Office, sur-
rounded by routine paperwork and manu-
als. He had a sharp chin, broad shoulders and a voice that commanded attention and discipline. 
Ettel, who has served 16 years at UPD, 
remarked that he considers law enforce-ment to be an opportunity to help stu-dents. 
“You get a few minutes to show com-
passion,” he said.
He recalled a moment when he helped 
a man who skidded on his bicycle and smacked his face on the pavement. Ettel ran into the same man years later at gradu-
ation, and the man remembered how he had washed his face and held his hand. 
“Those are the things you remember,” 
Ettel recalled. “They see you later on, and 
they remember.”
Just like the student who got his wallet 
stolen at UF’s Southwest Recreation Center will probably remember the empathy Met-rick showed Friday night when he spent 
part of the evening looking through bush-
es with a flash light near a Hull Road bus stop, hoping to find the wallet discarded in the leaves. 
The lanky student, with disheveled 
blond hair and a UF pre-med T-shirt, paced 
as he made multiple phone calls, distress 
lacing his voice. Metrick gave him advice about leaving personal belongings on the basketball court.
After taking his information, Metrick 
was back in his patrol car, and he parked in the lot next to Keene-Flint Hall. It was nearing 1 a.m., and people were starting to filter out of the bars. A woman in a  short 
clubbing outfit stumbled past Metrick. As 
she clung to her friend, she shouted and waved with a smile, “Heyyyy! Heyyyy!”
Metrick didn’t even flinch. He seemed 
used to the unexpected, drunken greet-ings, and focused more on spotting poten-tial drunken drivers than humoring the extroverted bar-hopper.Officers consider law enforcement an opportunity to help studentsBy YVONNE AYALA

While many students buzz along Gale 
Lemerand Drive as they make their way to 
class, few may give a second glance toward 
the shady oaks that conceal UF’s Wilmot Gardens. 
The gardens, which sit behind Shands 
Medical Plaza, have become the focus of 
a new Art in the Gardens program. The 
program offers art, music and meditation workshops and performances, all free and open to the public.
For example, Shands Arts in Medicine, 
or AIM, has hosted a weekly flora and fauna art series in the five-acre site since January.
During the series, Shands patients have 
worked with local artists to create their own art.      
AIM also hosts a weekly meditation se-
ries and monthly musical performances. 
“We’d like to see students studying, 
reading, relaxing and staff and physicians to take a walk and get away from every-thing in their day,” said Linda Luecking, the UF Wilmot Gardens project coordina-
tor.  “We want the university to want to use 
that space as a green space.”

It took Kyle Myers only two 
minutes and 51 seconds to eat 
30 wings at Gator’s Dockside on Tuesday night.
The two-time Newberry wa-
termelon-eating contest cham-
pion beat 23 other contestants in 
the “Wing of Fire” wing-eating competition, which included his roommate, Steven Langston.
Contestants, hands and faces 
covered in orange wing sauce, struggled to beat Myers as the Rocky theme song played in the background.
“I thought for sure that I had 
him,” Langston, who won second place, said. “And then I looked over and he was done.”
Contestants paid $25 to com-
pete. The event raised $750 for the 
American Red Cross, including 
donations.
The winner won a $25 gift cer-
tificate to Satchel’s and a trophy with a gold rooster on top.

referendum questions and the one initiative that passed. 
At the beginning of the meeting, 
many senators stood to speak. 
Unite Party Sen. Will Harrell 
summed up his thoughts by means 
of a short quote.
“I thank my God in all my re-
membrances of you,” he said, re-
ferring to the past memories and 
friends he made inside of Senate. 
Harrell also thanked his parents, who supported him throughout his four years at UF and even came to hear his remarks. 
Meanwhile, Progress Party Sen. 
Dave Schneider welcomed the new senators by laying out the tasks and challenges ahead of them.
“We have work to do,” he said. 
“We are facing budget cuts on the horizon, and now more than ever Student Government needs to be the soap box that speaks out to ad-
ministration.”
After a nearly four-hour meeting, 
old senators  representing various UF colleges and classes departed. 
Their newly elected replacements joined senators who were elected to represent on- and off-campus living 
areas in the fall, to start the second 
meeting of the night.  
About an hour of public debate 
ensued, where senators voiced opinions about who should become 
the new Senate president and Sen-
ate pro-tempore. 
During the discussion, re-elect-
ed graduate representative Sen. 
Ryan O’Mara stood to announce 
his resignation and to speak about the methods used by his fraternity when he was an undergraduate to sway elections at UF. 
O’Mara said he was forced to 
collect at least two “I-Voted” stick-ers and that members would be fined $50 if they failed to vote and 
recruit a friend to do the same. 
O’Mara, who recently ran in the 
Progress Party this semester, ran 
with the Gator Party in the past. 
“I knew my speech would piss 
people off but it’s because it’s the truth,” he said. “If it wasn’t, people wouldn’t have an issue with it.”

A UF graduate student in the College 
of Education has organized a candlelight 
vigil scheduled for today to protest the 
possibility of cutting the college’s under-
graduate programs.
The vigil is scheduled to start at 7:30 
p.m. in front of Norman Hall.UF recently asked the college, along 
with the College of Nursing, to present proposals with the pros and cons of cut-
ting their undergraduate programs.
Kali Davis, the student who is organiz-
ing the event, said a number of speakers 
have been lined up.
The list includes students from the 
college, the vice president of the Florida Education Association and UF professor Dorene Ross.There will be about 240 battery-operat-
ed candles available at the event.
The event has been called a funeral, 
but Davis said she’s reluctant to use that word.
“We don’t want to convey any mes-
sages around death or anything, but it is 
a time of mourning for public education,” 
she said.
On Tuesday in Tallahassee, students 
held an event of their own to kick off the start of the legislative session, protesting the possible cuts to Florida’s higher educa-tion system.
Julie LeBlanc, an FSU sophomore who 
attended the event, said about 600 people showed up to hear legislators and educa-tional leaders speak.
“There’s this preconceived notion that 
students don’t really give a damn, and I think this showed that that’s not necessar-ily true,” LeBlanc said.On c AMpuSStudent organizes candlelight vigil for education

local level.
All that money pays for the services of 
about 11 lobbyists, two on the federal level 
and nine on the state level.
The UF Foundation, which handles 
UF’s donations, pays for six of those lob-byists and the costs to maintain an of-
fice in Tallahassee, with private money. 
The money for three of the lobbyists comes 
out of UF’s budget and the two SG lobbyists 
are paid for through student fees. 
UF colleges and administrative units may 
also incur some lobbying expenses when 
they send faculty or administrators to Wash-
ington or Tallahassee to talk with lawmak-
ers. Sometimes a college, like the College of 
Medicine, may even pay to send students to a rally. 
Those funds, if they are spent, may come 
from various places like travel expense ac-
counts or external affairs budgets, according 
to information from UF officials. 
It’s not clear how much those costs might 
add up to in a single year.
Jane Adams, UF’s vice president of uni-
versity relations, said UF’s lobbying costs may seem like a lot, especially in tough bud-
get times, but she argued UF would be in much worse shape without its lobbyists.
On the federal level, for example, Adams 
said UF’s lobbyists helped secure about $23 
million in earmarks for research last fiscal 
year.
The projects that were funded range from 
termite research to research on renewable 
energy.
The project that saw the most money,  
$7.1 million, was for tropical and subtropi-
cal agriculture research, or T-Star, which in-
cludes research on reducing and eliminating invasive species.
“As you can see,” Adams said, “a  
$240,000 annual fee versus last year they 
helped us get $23 million. That’s an excel-
lent return on investment.”
For the current fiscal year, she said UF 
knows of at least $15.5 million in earmarks, 
though it is still combing through the re-
cently passed federal budget for 2008-2009 for other projects that got funding.
As was the case last year, T-Star got the 
biggest share of federal money, about $6.7 
million, according to the most recent infor-
mation.
But $15.5 million is only a fraction of what 
UF actually requested from Washington this 
fiscal year.
UF actually lobbied for about $79 mil-
lion for projects. Adams said that’s more of a wish list.
“We don’t expect to get anywhere near 
all of these proposals funded,” she said. “We 
have a long list of projects to let members of Congress pick which ones appeal to them.”
That list is culled from an even longer list 
of research projects presented to administra-tors by UF’s faculty. A panel of vice presi-
dents determines which of those make the 
cut and are included in the final request. 
Adams said UF’s lobbyists have been 
especially important this year, with govern-ment funds scarce during the state and fed-
eral budget crises. 
“We have to be very studious; we have to 
be very careful,” she said. “We 
have to look for any opportu-
nity we possibly can in order 
to get money in these times.”
There are many sources of funding that 
can be tapped for various projects, she said, 
but sometimes the trick is knowing where to 
look.
The recently passed economic stimulus 
package also put UF’s lobbyists to the test this year, she said.
She said one of the most important things 
they helped accomplish was to make sure 
Florida wasn’t excluded from education 
funding because of recent budget cuts.
Some funds in the stimulus are contin-
gent upon prior spending levels but, with 
universities slashing their budgets in recent 
years, they may not have been eligible for these funds.
Luckily for UF, she said, a waiver was 
placed into the bill which allows U.S. Sec-
retary of Education Arne Duncan to exempt 
specific states from the spending require-ments.
Gov. Charlie Crist recently sent a letter 
to Duncan asking that Florida be given that exemption, she said.
As for how UF’s federal lobbying expens-
es compare to other universities in Florida, 
UF ranks fourth. However, the reliability 
of the data was called into question when it was revealed that FSU, which, according to 
opensecrets.org, spent $520,000 in 2008, ac-tually spent about $62,000, according to Ray 
Bye, FSU’s director of federal relations and economic development at FSU.
It appears the database added the sal-
ary of the State University System’s lobbyist 
onto FSU’s list of lobbying expenses when, 
in fact, that lobbyist is paid directly from 
state funds.
According to the database, UF also lagged 
behind the University of South Florida, 
which spent $280,000 and Florida Interna-tional University, which spent $351,000.
Adams said the budget crunch has 
caused UF to reduce its lobbying costs this 
year. On the state level, UF is slated to spend 
about $100,000 less this year and the federal 
lobbying contract is up for renewal, which 
means UF will be shopping around for a bet-
ter deal, though she said UF probably won’t 
end up paying less.
She said she’s OK with that, though, con-
sidering the amount of money UF’s lobby-ists bring in.
“I’m satisfied with where we are,” she 
said.Compared to other Fla. universities, UF ranks fourth in federal lobbying

An Unexpected Gift
14-year-old with cerebral palsy brings joy to his family 
Fourteen-year-old Caleb is one 
of the 11 children of the Hutchi-
son family. Caleb has had athetoid cerebral palsy and been critically 
blind and deaf since birth. He is 
fed through a feeding tube and re-
quires constant monitoring.
His parents, Tammy and Scott,  
said they don’t think of him any 
differently than any of the other kids in the family. 
They say Caleb is a gift from 
God and the center of the family. 
They laugh together, pray together 
and go to church together.
“We’ve done everything that we 
know to make his life the best that 
it can be given the circumstances that he has,” Tammy said.

UF coach Tim Walton announced 
at his weekly press conference Tues-
day morning that senior center fielder Kim Waleszonia suffered a tibial pla-
teau fracture in her left knee and will 
likely not be back on the field for the 
No. 2 Gators until the postseason.
“We’re probably looking at the 
earliest return for her being postsea-
son,” Walton said. “If we get her back 
for the postseason, it’s going to be a 
good thing.”
The injury occurred during the first 
inning of UF’s 7-3 win against Texas 
Tech on Saturday, when Waleszonia 
dropped a bunt and was tripped by 
the Red Raiders second baseman, who put her foot across the bag while covering first base. 
Waleszonia tripped and flew 
through the air, landing in obvious pain. After spending several minutes on the ground, she was carried off the field by her coaches. 
A day before suffering the injury, 
Waleszonia got her 261st career hit, making her the career hits leader at UF.
Prior to Sunday’s games, which 
she watched from the dugout while 
on crutches, Waleszonia had started 
all 234 games of her college career.12, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009

You know the feeling you get when you’re trying 
to impress somebody, and you’re hoping more than 
anything else you don’t mess up?
Gymnasts know that feeling too well. Their sport 
depends on it. The UF gymnastics team has to im-
press two judges for dual meets week after week.
In a subjective sport where even a “hello” between 
gymnast and judge prior to the meet is considered a no-no, sometimes it’s all about giving off a good vibe and hoping the right judge picks it up.
UF junior Melanie Sinclair has been growing up 
with judges from the state of Florida and has estab-lished a natural rapport with them — even though it hardly affects the scores they give her.
Some judges have been evaluating her since she 
was young, and it has helped establish a natural, 
back-of-the-mind home-field advantage.
It’s nearly impossible to say if that extra smile or 
displaying team camaraderie helps for an extra hun-
dredth of a point, but it’s worth trying every time.
“Every time I see a judge, I al-
ways make sure that I’m laugh-ing or smiling,” Sinclair said. “Judges like it whenever you’re happy and carry that personal-
ity.”
Even though gymnastics is a 
sport where perfection is measured, gymnasts say 
they aren’t really paying attention to a numerical score after their dismount.
“You do leave it up to the judges’ hands when-
ever you do your stuff,” Sinclair said. “But by me being me and trying to be a good performer, I feel that should be enough in the judges’ eyes to give me what I need in order to have a good score.”
Alicia Goodwin said she simply sees her routines 
as either good or bad, and from there it’s up to the judge to determine what to score a good or bad rou-tine. The sophomore said she’s not focused on the judge as much as she is on carrying out her routine. 
Goodwin also said that for small things, she would 
try to blend in artistry to cover up any mistakes.
“If I have a little wobble, I try to cover it up with 
a pose and pretend that it’s supposed to be there,” 
Goodwin admitted. 
She said that while it may be aesthetically pleas-
ing to the crowd, it doesn’t get past judges.
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said gymnasts some-
times try to engage the judge along with the crowd. 
The best event for that engagement is floor exer-
cise, which is the longest event and gives the gym-
nast the greatest chance for artistic and personal ex-
pression.
“The time that they really get to interact with 
judges is on floor,” Faehn said. “On the floor, they 
actually have opportunities where they feel like they 
can perform and look the judges in the eyes.”
So how would Sinclair and Goodwin fare as judg-
es?
“I think I’d be pretty picky, but I wouldn’t be the 
judge everyone hates,” Goodwin said. 
Sinclair said she’d be a wholly unbiased judge, 
albeit the fun judge.
“I’m going to be fair, when it comes down to it,” 
Sinclair said. “Whoever is doing their gymnastics and doing it right, I’m going to give them what they 
deserve.”Gymnasts try

■ TWO NFL PLAYERS AND ONE FORMER SOUTH 
FLORIDA PLAYER ARE STILL LOST AT SEA.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CLEARWATER — The Coast Guard called off the search 
Tuesday for two NFL players and a third man lost at sea off 
the Florida coast after their boat capsized during a fishing trip.
Officials said the search would end at sundown, with 
Oakland Raiders linebacker Marquis Cooper, free-agent de-fensive lineman Corey Smith, who played with the Detroit Lions last season, and former South Florida player William Bleakley still missing in the rough, chilly seas.
“We’re extremely confident that if there are any survi-
vors on the surface of the water that we would have found them,” said Coast Guard Capt. Timothy Close, who added that searchers scoured the equivalent of 24,000 square miles over more than 60 hours.
Hopes were raised Monday when crews found a fourth 
man who was aboard, 24-year-old former South Florida player Nick Schuyler, who managed to stay with the boat after it overturned Saturday evening.
William Bleakley’s father said he felt comfortable with 
the Coast Guard’s decision and that his expectations low-ered after only one survivor was found.
“I think they did everything that they could,” Robert 
Bleakley said of the Coast Guard.

The No. 9 UF men’s tennis team 
continued its dominance over in-
state opponents with a 5-2 win 
against FSU in Tallahassee on Tues-day.
The Gators’ victory over the No. 
15 Seminoles was their third consec-
utive against a team from Florida, 
following a pair of dual-match wins over South Florida and Miami.
The initial point was collected 
by the Seminoles, as they won two of the three doubles matches. Only the newly ranked No. 80 duo of Car-los Cueto and Alex Lacroix won its 
match 9-8 (7-1).
Every first set in singles was won 
by UF.
The Gators (9-
3) received some help from courts 5 
and 6, where Jeff Dadamo and Eric 
Corace earned a 
point apiece in 
back-to-back sets 
for the Orange and Blue.
FSU fought back in the second 
sets, taking Courts 1 through 4 to a 
deciding set. The UF players were 
able to return to the forms of their initial sets and win matches on 
Courts 2, 3 and 4.
Only Cueto, the Southeastern 
Conference Freshman of the Week, 
lost his match, though it was after the Gators clinched the win.
“We have a good team,” UF 
coach Andy Jackson said. “It’s two months until the NCAA, where it really counts. 
“We’ve got to just keep getting 
better. We’re excited for the victory. It’s obviously a big one to beat Flor-ida State.”

INTRODUCTION
Florida’s Residential Landlord and Tenant 
Act, Sections 83.40 to 83.682, Florida Statutes 
(2007), is referred to as “the Act” in this publica -
tion. Most libraries have copies of Florida Stat-utes if more specific information is needed.
Florida Statues are also available online 
through the Florida Legislature’s website, (www.leg.state.fl.us). Explanations of the Act have state-wide applicability, but any specific references to Gainesville or Alachua County applies only to those areas.
The rental of mobile homes or mobile home 
lots is not covered in the Act. If you have a prob-lem in this area, you should contact an attorney.

Rental opportunities may also be found

Can I Be Evicted If I Pay “My” Rent and My Roommates Don’t?
Usually. Most leases provide that the ten-
ants are jointly and severally liable for the entire rent. This means the landlord can evict you unless the full rent is paid.
It is possible for you to sue your room-
mates in small claims court to collect their share of the rent and utilities. A writ-
ten roommate agreement will be helpful in proving your case in court. 
 Given the difficulty of collecting money 
on a judgment quickly, the best thing you can do is obtain new roommates.
So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!
Any judgment for money damages is en-
forceable for at least 20 years and earns interest. A judgment may be enforced by seizing your wages, bank accounts, or your personal property.  A judgment will also ad -
versely affect your credit rating.What Should I Look For In An Apartment?
Application Deposits: Never put down 
a deposit to hold an apartment unless you have a written agreement indicating wheth-er it is refundable.
Model Apartments: Never sign a lease 
based upon a model. Insist on seeing your actual apartment.
Cost: Can you afford it? Even if your 
roommates leave?
Safety: Inspect the locks on the doors and 
windows – is there a deadbolt on the front door? Do sliding glass doors have adequate locks to deter forced entry? Are the hallways and parking lots well lit? Make sure tree limbs and shrubs in front of the apartment are well trimmed. 
You can contact the Alachua County Sher -
iff’s Office or the Gainesville Police Depart-ment for information on crime in the area.
Function: At move-in, check all plumbing 
and appliances. Run water in sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and check air condi-tioning and heating. 
Inventory: Note all defects on the inven-
tory sheet or check-in list signed by the land-lord or an impartial witness. Photograph or videotape the apartment at movie-in.
Appearance: Is it clean? Do the carpets 
look worn or smell bad? Has the apartment been painted recently? Do the walls have nail holes?

What Can Happen If I Don’t Pay Rent?
Failure to pay rent is the quickest way to 
be evicted! The landlord will serve a notice demanding payment of rent or possession of the apartment. If you fail to comply with the demand within three days, excluding week-ends and holidays, eviction proceedings may be started. Neither surrender of the apart-ment or eviction ends your liability for rent! You should contact an attorney immediately upon receipt of a three-day notice.
Can I Be Evicted For Any Other Reason?
Yes! Your lease can be terminated if you 
violate any lease terms, rules and regula-
tions, or the Act. If your lease is terminated 
and you do not vacate the apartment, the landlord may file for your eviction immedi-ately.
Termination begins with a 7-day notice.  
Your options depend on whether the viola-tions are classified as “curable” or “noncur -
able”.
If you receive either type of notice, you 
should contact. Neither termination of your lease, nor your eviction from the apartment ends your liability for rent!Curable Violations
You will be given seven days to correct 
a curable violation. Curable violations in-clude unauthorized pets, guests, parking, or the failure to keep the apartment clean and sanitary. If you repeat the violation within 12 months, you will not be given another chance. 
Noncurable Violations
The landlord may terminate your lease 
with a 7-day notice without giving you a chance to correct a noncurable violation. Noncurable violations include deliberate de-struction or misuse of the landlord’s property or a continued, unreasonable disturbance. 
GETTING EVICTED
What Are My Duties As A Tenant?
� First, last and always, PAY RENT!
� Comply with all other lease terms.
� Comply with all rules and regulations.
� Comply with housing and health codes.
� Comply with all zoning restrictions.
� Keep the apartment clean and sanitary.
� Keep plumbing fixtures sanitary.
� Do not damage the apartment.
� Do not disturb your neighbors.
What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your right 
to occupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to pay rent. 
An eviction starts with a Summons. You 
must file an Answer within 5 days. Contact an attorney immediately.
If the court rules against you, a judgment 
for possession of the apartment, unpaid rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney’s fees will be entered for the landlord. The sheriff will post a notice at the apartment that requires you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and your personal property from the apartment.

� Do not sign a 12-month lease with room-
mates unless all roommates are willing to pay rent for 12 months.
� Do not have your parents signed the 
lease or a parental guarantee agree-ing to be responsible for rent, if pos-sible. See if the landlord will accept an additional security deposit instead.
� Do not sign a lease with automatic re-

Discuss with potential roommates preferenc-
es in food, music, personal habits, sleeping and 
study hours, friends and finances. An open and frank appraisal of each other’s likes, dislikes, and expectations will increase the chances of an enjoyable shared living experience. A writ-ten roommate agreement is advisable. 
Do I Really Need Insurance For MY Personal Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to re-
place all your belongings, you should have insurance. Proper insurance coverage will protect you against the loss of your valu-ables in most circumstances. Landlords are legally responsibly for such losses only under very specific, limited circumstances that may be very difficult to prove in court. 
If you are a resident-relative of your par -
ents, your personal property may be insured through their homeowner’s policy. Have your parents confirm the coverage in writing with their insurance agent. 
If coverage is not available through your 
parents’ homeowner’s policy, you may be able to purchase renter’s insurance. Even with insurance, there are certain precautions you should always take. Always lock your apartment securely even if you are only go-ing next door. Never leave jewelry, cameras, cash, checkbooks, credit cards, electronics, or other valuables in plain view.
 
GETTING ALONG
My Landlord Refuses to Make Repairs, What Can I Do?
You MAY be able either to withhold your 
rent or terminate your lease if the problem constitutes a material breach of the lease or the Act. You must follow the exact require-ments of the Act. 
 You must give the landlord a written notice 
demanding the repairs be made in seven days. The notice must indicate to terminate the lease or withhold rent if the repairs are not made.  
This is a complicated process and the le-
gal consequences are very serious. Do not attempt to terminate your lease or withhold rent without first obtaining legal advice.Can I Deduct Repair Costs From My Rent?
No. The Act does not authorize you to 
make repairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In fact, most apartment leases pro-hibit repairs by tenants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs, the Act gives you a qualified right to terminate the lease or withhold rent. As previously indicated, you should consult an attorney before attempting to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
Can I use My Security Deposit for the Last Month’s Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for 
non-payment of rent even when your “se-curity deposit” is equal to your last month’s rent. The purpose of the security deposit is to protect the landlord against damages to the apartment.
Does the Law Require Interest Payments on Security Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits in 
one of three methods. Two methods of hold-ing the deposits require interest to be paid. The method which does not require interest payment is the one most landlords use. The landlord is required to inform you in writing how your deposit is being held, where it is held, and whether you will receive interest.
What Can I Do If My Landlord Doesn’t Return My Deposit?
A landlord shall have 15 days after ter -
mination of the lease to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise required, if he or she does not intend to im-pose a claim on the security deposit. If the landlord intends to impose a claim in the se-curity deposit, he or she shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail, stating how much is going to deducted and why. You must object to the deduction in writing within 15 days from the date you receive the notice, or the landlord will be au-thorized to deduct his or her claim from your security deposit.
If the landlord fails to give the required 
notice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit.
However, if you damaged the apartment, 
the landlord can sue you even when the 30-day notice is not given. Because the landlord can also get court costs and attorney’s fees, you should consult an attorney before filing any lawsuits.
GETTING IT BACK
What Steps Can I Take To Protect My Security Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apart-
ment, complete a thorough written inventory of the apartment’s condition and have the land-lord or an impartial witness sign the inventory. Make sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This helps protect you from the landlord claim-ing you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the apartment 
completely and thoroughly. Some landlords provide a checklist outlining the cleaning they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts for cleaning supplies and professional car -
pet cleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the landlord to in-
spect the apartment with you. Complete a move-out checklist and make sure the land-lord signs and dates it. Use an impartial wit-ness if the landlord is not available or re-fuses your request. Move-in and move-out photographs or videotape are strongly rec-ommended in case there is a dispute.
What Can I Do About Noisy Neighbors?
Try to reason with the neighbor to reach 
an acceptable compromise. Thin walls and conflicting schedules make some amount of noise disturbance an unavoidable reality of apartment living.
Ask the landlord for assistance. If the 
landlord refuses to correct the problem, you may be able to break your lease. Because the law in this area is so poorly developed, legal representation is a necessity. 
In extreme cases, call the police and re-
port the matter. Unfortunately, this can lead to revenge and reprisals. I Can’t Stand My Roommate. What Can I Do?
Discuss the matter with your roommate im-
mediately. Don’t ignore the problem with the hope that it will go away. A little give and take may result in a livable compromise. 
Under the Act, your landlord is not re-
sponsible for most roommate disputes. If your roommate is violating the lease, you should consult an attorney.  
Can My Rent Be Increased During My Lease Term?
Not unless the lease contains a specific 
provision allowing for a rent increase. From the tenant’s perspective, one of the primary reasons for having a written lease is to lock in the rent for the rental period. Normally, you should not sign a lease providing for a rent increase.
Can My Landlord Enter My Apartment Without Notice?
No. Unless there is an emergency or you 
have abandoned your apartment, the land-lord must provide reasonable notice and ob-

One of the most common complaints the university receieves about off campus students concerns noise disturbances. Gainesville 
does have a noise ordinance and the city takes a very active approach in the enforecement of noise complaints. The noise ordi-nance gives police the authority to issue a citation to those in violation. 
Noise disturbance, as defined by the ordinance, is any sound which:1) Disturbs a reasonable person of normal sensitivities;
2) Exceeds the sound level units set forth in the ordinance; or
3) Is plainly audible defined as any noise or sound that can be clearly heard by a person using his/her faculties, at a distance of 
200 feet or more from the real property line of the source of the sound or noise.
The number of unrelated people allowed to live together in a single family zoned district is regulated by the city of Gainesville. The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the integrity and character of the residential areas. The Gainesville Code of Ordinances restricts the number of unrelated people living in a residence to no more than three. When you plan to share housing with room-
mates you are required to either restrict the number of occupants to three or seek appropriate housing in a multi-family district.
Gainesville has a curbside pick up of household garbage as well as curbside pick up of recyclable materials. The containers for 
these services tend to clutter the right of way and are not aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, the times that containers can be left out are regulated. Containers may be placed in front of your residence or at the curb, but not on the street, no earlier than the evening before your scheduled trash collection. Following the trash service, containers must remain behind the building, screened from view or placed in an enclosed structure. For information on pick-up of garbage, recycling or yard trash, contact the Gainesville Solid Waste Division at (352) 334-5040.
Your actions and behavior that is viewed by the public is subject to the Gainesville Code of Ordinances. Public conduct that cre-
ates a disturbance or is disorderly is prohibited. Behavior prohibited by the Disorderly Conduct Ordinance includes promoting or 
provoking disturbance, brawl, assault, or nuisance. Included under disorderly conduct are fighting words, unlawful congregation that hinders pedestrian or vehicular traffic, resisting or hindering the perfornace of duties by a police or city official, or damaging or destroying personal or private property.
In Gainesville residential areas, passenger vehicles are permitted to be parked on approved driveways only. Parking in the front 
yard of a residence, other than on an approved surface, is prohibited by the Gainesville Code of Ordinances. If you have any 
questions about the parking regulations you can contact the City of Gainesville Code Enforcement Division at (352) 334-5030. 
Apartment complexes may have regulations regarding parking or may require you to place a decal in your vehicle indentifying 
you as a resident. Contact the office of your apartment complex to inquire about parking regulations for your complex. Gainesville City Codes

tain your consent prior to entering your apart-
ment. 
You cannot unreasonably withhold con-
sent. If the landlord persists in entering with-
out notice or consent, contact an attorney.
How Soon Must I Renew My Lease?
There is no time period established by the 
Act. You should not sign a lease that pro-vides for automatic renewals of requires you to give the landlord a notice of nonrenewal. If you do sign such a lease, you must strictly comply with the notice requirements imposed by the lease.   
If the lease does not specify otherwise, 
renewals are a matter of general contract law. The landlord cannot force you to renew prior to the end of your lease.  However, if you do not renew by the landlord’s “dead -
line,” the landlord may rent your apartment to someone else. 
Getting Out
Can I Break My Lease Because…
I am graduating?  No!
My roommate left?   No!
I cannot afford the rent? No!
I need to work this summer? No!
The neighborhood is unsafe? No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate the 
lease if the landlord is materially violating your lease or the Act. You should obtain le-gal advice before attempting to terminate your lease. In many cases, the best thing you can do is find replacement tenants.
Can I Sublet My Apartment?
Usually. The landlord cannot unreason-
ably withhold consent to an assignment or sublease. The landlord may require potential replacement tenants to submit an application including a credit check. The landlord may also charge a reasonable sublet fee even when you provide the replacement tenants. Normally you remain liable under your lease if the replacement tenants do not pay rent or damage the apartment. Some landlords will release you from the obligations of your lease. If you are being released, get it in writing.
Can I Just Move Out and Forfeit My Security Deposit?
No. Some tenants will walk out on a lease 
and receive no adverse action, while others will be pursued to the fullest extent of the law.  In Gainesville’s current rental market, the odds are that you will be sued unless you supply acceptable replacement tenants. 
Your losses in court will not be limited to 
your security deposit, but will include rent for each month the apartment remains vacant during the term of your lease, plus court costs and the landlord’s attorney’s fees.

Having a roommate is a great way to divide the cost of living off campus.  But, 
if you don’t find the right person or persons to live with then living off campus could be challenging.  Below are some tips that will help you if you are thinking about living with a roommate.
� Start with a friend or sibling, these are often good options for roommates.
� Consider a person you went to high school with or a friend you have made while here at UF.� Communication is key…talk about your budget for housing, expectations for safety, expectations for guests and what your needs are for housing before you even begin your search.� Before moving in come to an agreement about who will get what bedroom.� Also discuss how payment of rents and other costs will occur.
Don’t have someone you want to live with?  Well don’t worry…some apartment 
complexes offer “roommate matching” or “roommate placement.”
o Roommate matching – you fill out a survey and management attempts to 
match you with like roommates based on the formo Roommate placement – apartment management places you in any open space they have availableo Make sure you can make a switch if the complex places you with roommates you are not compatible with.o You can also look for roommates on the Off Campus Housing Locator at www.offcampushousing.dso.ufl.eduo Also visit the Gator Guide to Off Campus Life for some great tips on how to stay friends while living together.  www.dso.ufl.edu/offcampus 
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, 21
Safety Tips:
Both personal and property safety is really important as you search for off campus 
housing.  Contact local law enforcement before signing a lease with the addresses of 
where you are looking to live and they can give you crime statistics for that area, call 
352-955-1818
Use these five tips when looking at safety during your apartment search:
1. Go back to the complex at night
2. Is the place well lit?
3. Look if the complex has security gates or guards and if they are in use
4. Check the surrounding area – is it close to a bus stop, etc.
5. During the tour, check for dead bolts on the outside door, locks for individual doors, alarm systems, 
etc. and ask lots of questions
Also visit the Off Campus Life website www.dso.ufl.edu/offcampus for more personal and property 
safety tips.

Clauses to LOOK FOR in a Lease: 
✓  Speciﬁ  c dates of occupancy. 
✓  Amount of monthly rent and the date it is due each month. ✓  Amount of Security Deposit. ✓  Responsibility for payment of utilities. ✓  Responsibility for general maintenance and repairs. ✓  Sublease: If you sign a 12 month lease but think you may need the dwelling for a shorter period of time, make certain the lease allows you to sublease (rent your dwelling to another person who will assume the remainder of your lease). ✓  Whether or not pets are allowed. ✓  Automatic renewal clause. ✓  Type of lease: joint vs. individual. 
Clauses to AVOID in a Lease: 
�  At management’s discretion, the tenant may be asked to leave within three days.�  Tenant waives all defects in the building. �  Landlord shall not be responsible for injury to person, including tenant and guests, as a result of any cause. �  Tenant is responsible for all repairs to premises. �  Landlord may enter dwelling without notice. �  Landlord has a lien (a legal claim on the property of another as security for the payment of a debt) on all personal property of tenant. 
A great University of Florida resource available to full time students is Student Legal Ser-
vices.  So if you aren’t sure if you should sign a lease, contact Student Legal Services and set up an appointment with a lawyer to help review your lease BEFORE you sign it. 
Visit http://www.sg.uﬂ  .edu/organizations/sls/ 
or call 352-392-LAWS for more information.  Leases:
Make sure you read and understand ALL leases fully be-
fore signing.  A lease is a contract between you and your landlord that spells out speciﬁ  c details of your living ar-rangement.  Leases often involve policies about pets, depos-its, legal entry and other important information.  Typically leases in Gainesville are for 12 months. If you know you only need an apartment for 10 months or less, talk with the management about whether they can provide you a shorter term lease.  There are two types of leases that are usually available, Joint Leases and Individual Leases.
Joint Lease: All roommates are held responsible for the 
lease, if one person breaks the lease, the other roommates are held responsible for paying the TOTAL rent.  This tends to be the lease more prominent when renting a house or single family dwelling.
 Individual Lease: Each person is held responsible for his or 
her own actions.  For instance, if one roommate breaks the lease that person is still responsible for paying their own rent.  For most college students, individual leases are the best choice.  Each person in the lease is responsible for his or her own ac-tions and not the actions of a roommate.
Information provided by Off Campus LifeWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, 23
Insurance:
If you are thinking about renting a house or apartment, renters insurance provides 
important coverage for both you and your possessions. A standard renter’s policy 
protects your personal property in case of theft or damage and may pay for tempo-
rary living expenses if your rental is damaged (including loss of use). It can also shield you from personal liability. Anyone who leases a house or apartment should consider 
this type of coverage. 
There are several types of residential insurance policies.  Read your policy informa-
tion carefully and ensure you have full coverage.  Policies should include the following 
items: 
	 Fire	or	lightning	
	 Windstorm	or	hail		 Explosion	
	 Aircraft	
	 Vehicles		 Smoke	
	 Vandalism	or	malicious	mischief 	
	 Theft	
	 Damage	by	glass	or	safety-glazing	material	that	is	part	of 	a	building	
	 Falling	objects		 Water-related	damage	from	home	utilities		 Electrical	surge	damage
Floods,	earthquakes,	and	hurricanes	aren’t	on	the	list.	If 	you	live	in	an	area	prone	
to one or more of the three, you’ll need to buy a separate policy or a rider. In ar -
eas where hurricanes can pose a threat you might also need to buy a separate 
rider to cover wind damage.  Ask your insurance agent about this extra coverage.  Gainesville	is	prone	to	hurricanes	and	in	some	areas	flood.
TIP:	If	you	are	still	financially	dependent	on	your	parents	and	they	own	a	home	then	
they	might	be	able	to	cover	you	under	their	homeowner’s	policy.		Some	homeowner	
policies	will	cover	a	dependant’s	rental	property	while	in	college.		So	talk	with	your	
parents before getting your own renter’s policy.

Information provided by Off Campus LifeBudgets:
You can’t find the right place to live until you know how much you are able to 
spend.  Here are some budget questions you should ask and think about when 
you are touring an apartment/house:
1. What is the monthly rent?2. What’s included in that rent…utilities, gas, water, cable, internet?
3. What’s not included and what is the average monthly cost for gas, electric, water, garbage disposal?  If management doesn’t know, contact 
GRU www.gru.com and they can give you average costs of utilities for 
the previous year.
4. Want to have a pet…factor in the deposit and monthly cost for food, 
medical, and grooming care.5. Don’t forget the insurance…before you sign your lease…call your insur -
ance company and see how much it will cost monthly to insure your apart-ment or house.6. Are you going to need fuel for your vehicle or are you going to use 
the bus?
7. How much do you spend monthly on groceries or meal plan?8. Have some fun…don’t spend so much on rent that you can’t go to 
dinner with your friends or maybe see a movie.
9. What do you spend monthly or yearly on clothing, shoes, accessories? 
10. It’s really good to save some money every month to cover those 
unexpected emergencies.  How much money can you save every month?  Even $20 a month saved is good…every little bit counts.

Alligator Writer
A white Hyundai Sonata cruises 
onto the turnpike blaring country 
music through scenic Pennsylva-
nia.
Breezewood. Halfway there.
For UF gymnast Corey Hartung, 
it’s a drive she and her mother, Karen, have made dozens of times.
Corey knows that once they get 
on the Pennsylvania turnpike, it’s time to count down to magic exit No. 7, now mile-based exit 67. To most commuters, it’s the exit to Ir-
win. To Corey, it’s the exit to her 
friends, brother, Justin, sister, Ash-ley, her father, Jeff, and to a special kiss with her dad — one that’s been routine since kindergarten.
The three-hour drive up from 
Gaithersburg, Md., to Pittsburgh is something Corey became accus-tomed to in eighth grade. She had no other choice. She loves gymnas-
tics so much that she was willing to 
be three hours away from her fam-ily. It’s a sacrifice the whole family, not just Corey, made so she could pursue the love of her life.
From Irwin to Gaithersburg
Mix two parts innate skill and 
one part chance, and you get the beginnings of Corey’s gymnastics 
career.
Corey, then 8 years old, along 
with her then-10-year-old sister 
Ashley, had always been active. Corey was a promising softball player with a strong swing before she even set foot on a mat. 
But it was Kasomon’s Gymnas-
tics, a gym 10 minutes down the road from Corey’s house in Pitts-
burgh, that changed everything.
What had started out as a chan-
nel for cartwheels, flips and bot-
tled-up energy turned into the be-ginnings of a lifestyle for Corey.
“Gymnastics kind of seemed to 
fit her, and she seemed to fit it,” Jeff said.
After a while, expenses piled up, 
and Ashley quit. But not Corey.
“I knew I didn’t want to quit. 
I knew I had a talent for it, and I had a dream to go further, so I con-vinced my parents to let me stay in it,” Corey said.
Sure enough, she did have tal-
ent, and soon Kasomon’s couldn’t contain her. One day, Corey, perched on her dad’s lap, pleaded 
to her parents to let her pursue 
gymnastics.
“I remember just crying to (my 
dad) and just telling him, ‘I don’t want to do it here anymore. I want 
to go somewhere where I trust the 
coaches, and I know that there’s 
success there, and I know that I can follow my dreams,’” Corey said.
And the winner for most deter-
mined 12 1/2-year-old … Corey Hartung.
In just three quick months, Karen had a new job, and she and Corey were making the first of 
many drives to their new home, 
new school, new job and new life in Gaithersburg.
How do you spell sacrifice? G-A-I-T-H-E-R-S-B-U-R-G.“It was a big sacrifice,” Karen 
said. “Not only me, but very much (Corey) because she gave up all her friends and her sister and her brother and her dad. But she said, 
‘This is what I want.’”
This is a girl who gave up her 
family, her home, her best friend 
since first grade and her school in Pittsburgh for gymnastics.
Leann DeMuzzio couldn’t be-
lieve her best friend was leaving her.
“I was really upset,” DeMuzzio 
said. “That just shows how dedi-
cated she was to gymnastics. She 
left everything and left her comfort 
zone.”
Corey’s middle school even 
made a banner for her that was 
signed by the whole school as a 
farewell to Corey.
Tough? Sure. Worth it? Defi-
nitely.
“The main thought going 
through my head was, ‘I’m going 
to become a better gymnast here at 
Hill’s, and I can’t wait to get start-ed and achieve my goals and win competitions,’” Corey said.
From Level 10 to Top 18
“The first year was tough, I’m 
not going to lie about that,” Corey admitted. “But after I knew I was 
going in the right direction, after I 
figured out it was worth moving, everything fell into place.”
Hill’s Gymnastics was tough on 
Corey mentally, emotionally and physically, demanding nearly 40 hours a week of practice.
“With Kelli Hill (Hill’s Gym-
nastics founder and coach), it was a very big wake-up call,” Corey 
said. “I was sore, I think, every day 
for the first six months because the intensity and conditioning was so hard.” 
During Corey’s first year at 
Hill’s, Kelli didn’t think Corey could be an elite gymnast. 
She even told Corey she would 
be demoted to level 10, the ranking 
below “elite” for gymnasts.
“I remember her telling me that, 
and I was so determined to be an 
elite,” Corey said. “I was like, ‘No, Kelli, I’m going to work my butt off to be an elite.’ There was no way I was going to be a level under what was the top level.”
In 2003 and 2004, Corey not only 
proved she was an elite gymnast, 
but that she was one of the top 18 
gymnasts in the country, landing a spot on the U.S. Senior National Team.
“It just helped you realize what 
you worked for your whole life, 
the sacrifices you made,” Corey said. “My family went through a 
lot of sacrifices for me, more than most others would. We had to go 
through some hard times for me to 
get there.”
Following the 2004 Athens 
Olympics, under the tutelage of Hill, an Olympic coach, college gymnastics entered the picture, and Corey was a hot commodity.
“We just said, ‘You decide where 
you feel more comfortable,’” Jeff said. “‘We’ll support you again.’”
Letters poured in from a slew of 
schools. Corey’s first instinct was Georgia, where she had family. There was also UF, LSU and Ala-bama to choose from. 
All of them wooed her, but UF 
coach Rhonda Faehn won the re-cruiting competition — by a land-slide.
From Recruit to Role Model
People say Faehn and Corey 
look alike. They talk alike. Even 
their gymnastics are alike.
“I just fell in love with (Faehn) 
right away,” Corey said. 
Corey was able to relate to 
Faehn, whose gymnastics back-
ground closely mirrors Corey’s.
The feeling was mutual.Faehn still remembers grilling 
hot dogs and hamburgers on her recruiting visit and the immediate 
comfort level between the two.
“I just kept thinking, ‘Wow, if 
she comes to Florida, that would be 
amazing,’” Faehn said.
It didn’t take long for Corey to 
commit to UF. 
Once again, Corey had a hill to 
climb as the only freshman in her class. 
She may have been the lone 
freshman, but her work ethic was that of a decorated veteran.
Practice had ended, other gym-
nasts had left, but Corey was still there, whether it was for condition-ing, extra conditioning or anything else.
It paid off.
“It was one amazing competi-
tion after another,” Faehn recalled. 
In her freshman year, Corey was 
named a three-time All-American 
on balance beam, floor exercise and in the all-around category. 
“I was just really proud of her,” 
Faehn said. “I thought she did an unbelievable job, especially going it alone.”
Nine All-American titles later, 
Corey is on the verge of ending her career as one of the greatest gym-nasts at UF. 
Her picture hangs in the Ted 
Cromm Gymnastics Studio as the model of hard work and determi-nation.
Long after Corey is done at 
UF, her legacy will include more than just her competitive nature, 
awards, ballet-like gymnastics or 
event titles.
She’ll be remembered for her 
down-to-earth, unabashed person-ality.
“I’m a girl who will cut my own 
grass wearing a dress,” Corey said. “I’m not scared to get dirty doing a man’s job but still enjoy looking good doing it.”
She’ll be remembered as the girl 
who never accepted anything less than the absolute best.
And she’ll surely be remem-
bered as the girl who, come meet 
night, had a Michael Jordan-esque 
fire in her eyes that burns you to the core.
Don’t let that glare intimidate 
you though. 
It’s reserved only for meet 
nights.
Any other day, that fiery gaze 
is replaced by a  warm, sincere expression, and that competitive scowl is swapped with a fun-lov-
ing, caring smile.
“I want people to come to me if 
they want help,” Corey said. “I en-
joy doing things for others.”
Don’t believe her? Take it from 
someone who’s known her longer than she’s been doing gymnastics.
“If I ever need anything, I know 
she would be there for me,” De-Muzzio said.
So when Corey is honored Fri-
day against Michigan in her last home meet, know that it’s been a 14-year roller coaster ride with ups unmatched by any vault jump, 
downs worse than any beam-biting 
fall and sacrifices greater than any three-hour drive.
“It’s been an amazing journey 
for us and for (Corey), and I’m just sorry that it’s over,” Karen said. “She’s really going to miss it.”30, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009

corey Hartung
UF senior gymnastGymnast takes long journey from home to compete for four years at UFUF follows up the game at Mis-
sissippi State with its season finale 
against Kentucky at home Satur-
day in what will most likely play 
out like a tournament elimination game.
The Gators are currently tied 
for third with the Wildcats in the SEC East.
“We’re worried, but in a good 
way,” Parsons said. “I’m nervous, but yeah, everyone’s nervous be-
fore a game, especially how big 
this game is.”
In a similar situation last year, 
UF failed to finish out the season 
strong, losing eight of its last 11 
games.
It was a stretch that saw the 
Gators lose their last four games of the season — including a first-
round loss in the SEC Tournament 
— and miss out on the Big Dance for the first time in a decade.
“Of course we’re fired up to 
get out there and win and play ourselves into the tournament,” guard Erving Walker said. “And then, honestly, there probably is a little sense of panic. Not in a bad 
way, but just knowing that it’s 
coming to an end and we’ve got to get it done.”
After last season’s end-of-the-
year collapse, UF rebounded to play its way to the semifinals of the National Invitation Tourna-ment.
This time around, the Gators 
hope to stay as far away from Madison Square Garden as pos-sible.
UF is No. 49 in the latest RPI 
rankings, has a strength of sched-ule that ranks 94th in the country and has just one quality win out-side SEC play (against Pacific-10 Conference leader Washington).
“I would say the team, myself 
and as a team, nobody wants to go to the NIT. So there probably is, knowing that there’s two (reg-
ular-season) games left, panic,” 
Walker said. “Not in a bad way like scared. But just some type of urgency, wanting to win and get back out there. I think that can be 
good.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 31

For someone who was pro-
jected to be the closer, Jeff 
Barfield turned in an impres-sive start.
The junior college trans-
fer went 6 2/3 innings in his first start as a Gator and set the tone for a 5-2 road victory against Stetson on Tuesday night. 
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said before the season that 
Barfield was the likely 
candidate to close games for the Gators (6-3), but the junior right-hander found him-self on the 
mound from the opening pitch 
against the Hatters (2-7). 
“The truth of the matter is, 
we went through two week-
ends and used him only one 
time,” O’Sullivan said of his 
decision to start Barfield. 
“We needed to get him out 
there.”
Barfield didn’t disappoint. 
He allowed five hits and 
1 run while striking out four 
and only walking one. 
O’Sullivan said Barfield 
could earn a regular spot in the rotation, but he is not wor-ried about defining his pitch-ers’ roles right now. 
Junior Billy Bullock was 
once again used in the closer’s role against Stetson, as he picked up his second save of the season in 1 2/3 innings  of work.
Offensively, the Gators re-
corded only six hits, but they 
were able to score runs by hit-
ting for extra bases.
UF freshman Preston 
Tucker put the first run on the scoreboard in the fourth inning when he deposited his first career home run over the right-field wall. 
The next inning, freshman 
Jerico Weitzel led off the fifth by stretching a single to left-center field into a double. 
“We always tell them, 
‘You better be sure you can make it with nobody out,’” O’Sullivan said. “I held my breath there.”
Shortstop Michael Mooney, 
who was back in the nine hole after a brief stint in the No. 2 spot of the lineup, laid down a sacrifice bunt, and senior Av-ery Barnes drove Weitzel in with a sacrifice fly.
The Gators would increase 
their lead to 5-1 by the end of the sixth, and that was more 
than enough run support for 
Barfield and the bullpen. 
“These midweek games 
make you nervous. We have a lot of young pitchers, and we need them to show up,” O’Sullivan said. 
UF heads back to 
Gainesville for a game against Florida Atlantic tonight at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium. 
A radio broadcast contributed 
to this report.UF BASEBALLBarfield gives up 
1 run in first start
powerhouse Volunteers.
Then things went bad in a hurry.
Butler attributes much of her team’s failures to 
its inability to defend.
UF, which prided itself on defense in its early-
season victories, allowed 84, 66, 83 and 84 points in its last four losses.
The Gators had only given up 45 points to Geor-
gia in Gainesville during the teams’ first meeting, but let the Bulldogs put up 84 on Sunday.
“We could play better defense,” Butler said. 
“We, in all of those losses, gave up way, way, way 
too many points.”
The reason for UF’s difficulties may very well 
have been playing some pretty good teams away from home.
But the Gators better get used to that and learn 
how to adjust quickly if they want make a run in 
the postseason. UF will likely face No. 5-seed Ten-nessee on Friday night in North Little Rock, Ark. — another good team away from home.
Butler is confident her team will answer the 
challenge this time around.
“The one thing that this team 
has really responded to this year is the opportunity to practice and 
improve,” Butler said. “I fully 
expect that’s what we’ll see from them this week as well, knowing 
that the stakes are even higher and there aren’t go-
ing to be second chances, there aren’t going to be 
next games.”Defense must improve for tourney success
minuscule, outside chance that the 
Gators get an NCAA Tournament berth by winning the Southeastern Conference Tournament.
“Even if I had to play on one leg, 
I was going to play on one leg. It’s a mental thing,” she said. “If you don’t think about it then it don’t hurt.”
Brooks entered her junior year 
with a new coach, a new system and expectations to be one of the best players in the SEC. 
There was improvement, sure, but 
Brooks had now spent three years in 
Gainesville with no NCAA Tourna-
ment wins and only three victories in the SEC tourney. 
Now comes the grand finale, her 
senior season
Brooks deserves an standing ova-
tion for this season. The Gators are headed back to the NCAA Tourna-ment on the shoulders of Brooks, and 
they may even have a shot at winning their first-ever SEC Tournament. She 
lit Tennessee up for 29 points in ar-guably the program’s biggest win in three years. 
“Her level of play just really ele-
vates the bigger the game and the im-plications of the game,” Butler said. “That’s really special. She doesn’t shy away from the pressure. She tight-ens up her laces and goes to another level. 
“She’s already led us to some 
things that have not happened here 
before. As many great teams as 
there’s been here, there haven’t been a ton that have had that top-four seed (in the SEC Tournament).”
That’s a scary thought for the rest 
of the tournament field. The bigger the game, the better Brooks plays.
It’s true. Twenty-five points in 
a 79-78 upset against No. 2 LSU her 
freshman year. Twenty-one against 
No. 21 Kentucky that same season.
“She’s our little beast,” senior 
forward Marshae Dotson said. “She doesn’t take no crap.”Now the opportunity is here. This 
little beast could catapult herself to the top of the “Gator Greats” if she leads UF deep into March.
“It’s players that understand how 
to compete and compete over a long period of time,” said Tennessee coach Pat Summitt when asked what goes into making a player have an impact on her program. “When postseason comes, they’re not going to give in to fatigue.”
This is the team that could set the 
tone for the program. 
And if it goes deep into March 
after perhaps winning the SEC Tour-nament, there will be recruits hoping to talk to Butler and UF, not the other way around.
“Whether people think I’m a good 
point guard or one of the worst point guards ever, I just try to stay focused 
and stay composed,” Brooks said. 
Whatever she’s doing, it has 
worked for her, maybe better than 
any women’s basketball player ever to play in Gainesville.SEC , from page 32

TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY POLL QUESTION INSIDEBy CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer

Some may be searching for what 
went wrong all of a sudden or when ev-
erything just went bad.
How did the Gators go from 22-2 and 
tied for first place in the Southeastern Conference to the No. 4 seed in the SEC Tournament and a major losing skid?
If you ask UF coach Amanda Butler 
about why her team has lost four of its last five games, she’ll give you a pretty straightforward answer.
“We just played some really good 
teams, and we played some really good teams on their home floors,” Butler said during the SEC Tournament teleconfer-
ence on Monday. “We ran up against 
some teams that were really, really ready to play and took very seriously home-court advantage.”
The list of the Gators’ defeats in-
cludes road losses at SEC Tournament No. 2-seed Vanderbilt by 16, at No. 3-seed LSU by 19 and at No. 7-seed Georgia by 9.
Throw in their only home loss of 
the season to No. 8-seed Arkansas, and people are wondering if the wheels have fallen off at the worst possible time.
“When you get to February in the 
SEC, you’re going to see great talent 
and great coaching combined,” Butler 
said. “Nobody’s going to have an easy win.”
Nothing has come easy for the Gators 
since Feb. 8.
That’s the day UF had what ap-
peared to be a monumental win against then-No. 12 Tennessee.
The Gators were sitting at 8-1 in the 
conference and appeared to be on cruise control following their toppling of the

It’s hard to see it behind her meek smile. 
Or maybe it’s her small 5-foot-7 frame that 
keeps you from catching a glimpse.
It could be her quiet, shy demeanor that makes 
you wonder if she’s capable of more than a five-
minute chat.
Perhaps it’s the fact that there’s not much of a 
strut or a presence that overwhelms you.
You don’t see Sha Brooks and think “star ath-
lete.” Even after talking to her, you still don’t see it. 
All-Southeastern Conference from this girl? Really?
You have to wait to see that until she plays. Then 
you’re convinced. And it has been a very convinc-
ing four years in Gainesville 
for Brooks.
You probably won’t 
recognize her on Stadium 
Road or at The Hub. She’s too quiet and small to draw attention.
When she puts on her 
sneakers and dons orange and blue, however, she be-
comes someone who will go 
down as one of the best players in UF history.
Brooks has her name all over the Gators record 
books, but other players have put up better num-
bers than she has. That’s not why she should be list-ed among the “Gator Greats,” as UF coach Amanda Butler calls them. 
It’s because she has gone through as much as 
one college athlete can.
She helped the Gators earn an NCAA Tourna-
ment berth her freshman year on a senior-laden team where she was the second-leading scorer, only to get blown out 83-59 in the first round by 11-seed New Mexico.
Then came a sophomore year where she played 
with a torn meniscus in her left knee on a team that was dreadful and got then-UF coach Carolyn Peck fired. But Brooks refused to shut it down on the Brooks could 
leave as legend

No one is confusing Nick Calathes with 
Joe Namath, but this as close to a guarantee 
as you’re going to get from the Gators this 
season.
“I think that we will definitely make the 
tournament,” Calathes said. “I think we can do it. That’s just my opinion. I just know 
our team. I know we need these two games, and we still got the SEC Tournament. I’ve got confidence in our team.” 
The Gators (21-8, 8-6 Southeastern 
Conference) have lost four of their last six games and have lost two straight.
With time slipping away, UF can’t af-
ford another loss when it plays Mississippi State (17-12, 7-7 SEC) tonight at 8 p.m. in Starkville, Miss.
The Bulldogs lead the 
conference in 3-point shooting (246 made this 
season), and the Gators 
are second to last in de-fending the three.
Mississippi State also 
poses problems in the 
paint for UF with 6-foot-9 shot blocker Jarvis Varnado.
ESPN’s Joe Lunardi, who predicts the 
NCAA Tournament bracket, had UF as one of his first four teams out of the tournament 
Sunday night.
“I would definitely say there’s a sense of 
panic, a sense of urgency,” forward Chan-
dler Parsons said. “Everybody will be on 
edge understanding what’s at risk here.”Calathes thinks UF will ‘definitely’ make tournament  SEE SEC, PAGE 31
