A man who allegedly shot his ex-girlfriend Saturday 
afternoon died from a seizure the same day.
After Trevon Miller, 18, was taken into custody , he 
had a seizure, was taken to Shands at UF and died 
there.
Hours before, Devin Colson, 18, 
drove to Miller’s apartment at 2307 
SW 32nd Place to retrieve personal belongings. She brought a 15-year-old friend along.
Shortly after Colson entered unit 
No. 4 inside Southwood Apartments, she and Miller got into a physical ﬁ  ght upstairs, according to Angelina 
Valuri, Gainesville Police Department spokeswoman.
Colson left the apartment, and Miller’s friend and 
roommate, Gbati Djeri, told her not to come back.
Before Colson could start her engine, Miller came 
out of his apartment and began shooting at the car.
Colson and the 15-year-old girl jumped out.Alleged

Changes to city and campus bus routes are coming this 
fall, and they could include route extensions and shorter bus 
hours.
The Gainesville Regional Transit System held an informa-
tional meeting Thursday night at City Hall proposing chang-es to bus routes running through the city, UF and Santa Fe College.Douglas Robinson, chief transit planner for RTS, said the 
changes are the result of funding, route performance, citizen input and student enrollment evaluations.
The  approved changes will go into effect on Aug. 19 and will run until Dec. 30.
The changes under consideration include adding a Satur-
day service for Route 25, which runs from the UF Commuter Lot to Gainesville Regional Airport, and extending all Sunday routes to 6 p.m. The latest Sunday hours this summer end at about 5 p.m., according to information from the RTS website.
Other changes include extending Route 121, which cur-
rently runs from the Hub to the Commuter Lot at UF, east RTS proposes route changes at informational meetingMiller

Earth, Venus and the sun will align Tues-
day in a rare astronomical event that won’t 
be repeated for more than a century.
A dark spot will be visible moving across 
the sun as Venus passes directly between it and Earth.
Spectators in the Sunshine State can ob-
serve the phenomenon, called a transit, from 6:03 p.m. to 8:26 p.m., depending on loca-tion.
Peter Barnes, assistant scientist of as-
tronomy at UF, said the next transit won’t be until 2117.The reason these transits are so rare, 
Barnes said, is because Venus’ orbit around the sun is tilted compared to Earth’s orbit.
The UF Department of Astronomy will 
provide public a free opportunity to view Venus’ transit safely on the east end of Fla-vet Field.
Francisco Reyes, associate scientist and coordinator of the astronomy event, cau-tions that observation of the sun without a solar ﬁ  lter can cause permanent damage to eyesight.
According to Peter Nguyen, UF astron-
omy alumnus, the sun’s brightness could destroy even the optical instruments of the Hubble Space Telescope.
“The rarity is what makes it exciting for 
me,” Nguyen said. “This will be an insane opportunity for the community.”Venus transit will align Earth, Venus and the sun in rare event
It won’t happen again for more than a centurySEE BUS, PAGE 8“The decision to remove weekday service on 
this route had a lot to do with this route overlap-

Black bear euthanized after eat-
ing Canadian murderer
KAMLOOPS, British Colum-
bia — Canadian conservation ofﬁ  -
cers have euthanized a black bear that they think ate the remains of a convicted murderer.
British Columbia Environment 
Minister Terry Lake said Monday  the bear’s description matched that of one seen guarding a cache containing human remains.
Lake said the animal was put 
down because bears remember food sources.
Ofﬁ  cials suspect the bear 
pulled the body of Rory Wagner, 54, from his car after he died on a remote logging road.
Wagner pleaded guilty to 
second-degree murder in 1994. He and two others were charged with a killing a man who they believed had sexually assaulted a family member. He served his prison time and was released.

Police: Bank robber had to be 
cut from air duct
OAK LAWN, Ill. — A wig-
wearing man broke into a sub-
urban Chicago bank vault and nearly made off with $100,000 but got stuck in an air duct and had to be cut out hours later, au-thorities said Sunday.
Charles Estell, 38, was found 
early Sunday hiding in an air duct in an ofﬁ  ce next to the bank, according to Oak Lawn police spokesman Michael Kaufmann.
The Chicago man had alleg-
edly robbed the suburban bank Saturday afternoon, and pointed a gun at bank employees who confronted him in the vault, ac-cording to the FBI.
“I don’t want to kill or hurt 
you,” Estell said, according to the criminal complaint. “I just want the money.”
He allegedly stuffed $100,000 
in a backpack and ﬂ  ed. Employ-ees told authorities it appeared he escaped through the ceiling.

June 6, 1989 — UF research-
ers misplace vials of radioac-
tive liquid for the second time in two months, prompting a state investigation. Seven vials of Phosphorus 32, a liquid with weak radioactivity that can be harmful if touched or swal-lowed, were apparently left in the box they had been shipped in. According to UF Radiation Control Officer Don Munroe, all the vials that were lost in the past two months prob-ably ended up in the county’s Southwest Landfill.
June 1, 2006 — A threatened 
species of bird is released on Paynes Prairie after having suf-fered critical injuries. Saman-tha, a bald eagle, was released from the UF Veterinary Medi-cal Center and the Alachua Audubon Society after 41 days of rehabilitation. Samantha’s injuries included a crippled left leg, swollen right shoulder, blood in her lungs and air sacs, and impaired vision and were thought to be a result of a colli-sion with a motor vehicle. The bald eagle was released near the accident site after her hunt-ing and flying skills were back to normal.
June 7, 1983 — Newberry

The first section of the new 
overpass on Southwest 13th 
Street was installed Monday around noon.
Construction on the over-
pass, located south of Archer Road near the 900 block of Southwest 13th Street, began in March. 
It will be completed this 
fall, said Gainesville Commu-nity Redevelopment Agency Interim Director Kelly Huard Fisher.
The overpass was once a 
railroad bridge that was part of the Depot Avenue Rail Trail, but now it is a pedes-trian and bicycle path.
Project Manager Diane Gil-
reath said the rail trail will be closed during construction.
 Southwest 13th Street will 
not be closed, but it may have single-lane closures, Fisher said.  
The new overpass is de-
signed to pay homage to Gainesville’s past and future, she said. The design features a railroad track in the form of a double helix, or DNA strand.
“Gainesville was founded 
on railroad commerce,” Fisher said. She said the track will twist to a double helix to rep-resent biotechnology and re-search.
The agency held a competi-
tion for the design of the new overpass. The winning design was created by a team of engi-neers and landscape architects from Reynolds, Smith and Hills Inc., according to a press release.
At least three more sections 
need to be installed before the overpass is completed.
“They are manufactured 
off-site and can be erected fairly quickly,” Fisher said.
The project is being funded 
by the redevelopment agen-cy’s College Park/University Heights Redevelopment area and is budgeted for $999,000.
The project also features 
a stairway connecting 13th Street to the rail trail, accord-ing to the Gainesville Commu-nity Redevelopment Agency website.
This is one project in a series 
of initiatives, which include brick sidewalks, new lighting fixtures and improved con-nectivity between UF, Innova-tion Square and downtown.

The blood of a firefighter runs 
rampant in Dave Miller’s veins.
For 16 years, Miller extinguished 
fires and assisted people as a volun-
teer firefighter in Pennsylvania until lung complications forced him to re-tire in 1994.
He now lives in Gainesville as a 
writer, but after an 18-year absence from firefighting, Miller, 49,  said he feels out of the loop.
On Saturday , Miller trekked 
through familiar ground as one of the 22 participants in the Gainesville Fire Rescue Department’s inaugural Citizens’ Fire Academy.
“I still miss it. It’s in your blood,” 
he said. “It takes a lot of character to be able to be the one running in when everyone’s running out.”
The academy immersed par -
ticipants in hands-on scenarios that simulated real emergency situations GFR has experienced in the last year.
Participants, equipped with hard 
hats and fireproof uniforms, worked closely with department staff and union members to cut car doors with specialized tools, simulate a search and rescue mission, operate a fire hose and practice CPR.
“It really shows people the true 
working conditions for firefighters,” said Krista Gonzalez, a GFR risk re-duction specialist and public educa-tion coordinator.
Gonzalez, 27, said a one-week 
academy for middle-school students has been active within the depart-ment for about 12 years.
Saturday’s event was the first 
time the department held a fire 
academy for adult citizens.
“We realized that we’re doing it 
for the middle schools, so why aren’t 
we exposing our adults to this?” she said.
Candidates for the academy 
applied in the beginning of April. When applications closed in May , the department started choosing candidates, mainly on a first-come, first-served basis for those who met minimum health requirements.
Gonzalez said she was pleased to 
see a range of residents interested in the academy.
Gainesville City Commissioner 
Susan Bottcher was among the sev-eral city officials who participated.
“It gives you an appreciation for 
people who put themselves in life-threatening positions,” she said.  
Gene Prince, GFR fire chief, said 
the academy also gives residents an opportunity to see the lifesaving equipment their tax money pays for.
“We want them to see that we 
keep [the equipment] for a long time, and we take good care of them,” he said.
Rescue Special Operations Chief 
Donald Sessions ended the day with a presentation on fire prevention and codes.
Although the academy is in its 
first year, Tracey Higdon, president of GFR’s Local 2157 firefighters’ union, said he hopes the department will continue to host the event in the future.
“I think there is a lot of value 
letting people see who we are,” he said.
Ron Ozbun, 67, a retired UF staff 
member, said experiencing the sce-narios helped him better appreciate the department’s services.
“I look at the department as my 
lifeline,” he said. “I have a lot of re-spect for these people now.”

� A MAN LAY IN A BATHTUB OF 
GASOLINE AND LIT HIMSELF ON FIRE.
FRANCESCO FERRO
Alligator Contributing Writer
A suicide attempt at an apartment complex 
caused an explosion that shook the building 
early Monday morning.
Police and emergency personnel respond-
ed to multiple calls of an explosion at Gateway at Glades apartments, 3415 SW 39th Blvd., at about 2:40 a.m.
There was some fire and the smell of gaso-
line coming from within the apartment after the explosion, said Gainesville Police Depart-ment Lt. Mike Schibuola.
The explosion was caused by a suicide at-
tempt by Paul Bhawnani, 57, according to an update given by Angelina Valuri, GPD spokeswoman.
The explosion occurred when the fully-
clothed Bhawnani seated himself in the bath-tub that was filled with gasoline, Valuri said.
Then he intentionally set himself on fire.Bhawnani was unconscious and severely 
burned when Gainesville Fire Rescue pulled him out of his apartment. He was transported to Shands at UF in critical condition.
No other injuries were reported.Mercedes Camacho, resident of apartment 
No. 131, said Bhawnani was her next-door neighbor.
Camacho had just gotten back home when 
she thought she heard what sounded like someone kicking the door.
She said there was “just one big loud bang,” 
and then the building shook. “It shifted the sofa from underneath,” Ca-
macho said.
Clarence ‘CJ’ Cooper, resident of apartment 
No. 122, said he felt the walls shake as well.
“I thought someone was trying to break 
in,” Cooper said. “I smelled the fire when I opened my door.”
Jonathan Leary called 911 when he saw the 
explosion while playing basketball nearby.
He saw a wall blow out, which sounded 
like a shotgun blast.
Bhawnani’s condition had not changed as 
of Monday at 1 p.m.Attempted suicide by gasoline leads to apartment explosion“It takes a lot of charac-
ter to be able to be the one 
running in when everyone’s

Daniel Baralt, a 22-year-old sociology senior, poses in front of Ben Hill Griffin Sta -
dium Monday evening. Baralt is the director of Gainesville Football Rentals.
SHELBY WEBB

It’s a tradition almost as old as the Gator 
chomp — every football gameday weekend, 
real estate values in Gainesville spike.
A single parking spot could cost Gator fans 
more than $20, and hotel prices rise sky-high.
This fall, locals and students may have a way 
to cash in on this sporadic overcrowding.
Gainesville Football Rentals allows families 
and students who live close to UF to list and rent their houses on weekends when accom-modations are in high demand, such as gradua-tion, game days and Gator Growl.
“What this does is provide alternatives,” 
said Daniel Baralt, director of the Gainesville rentals. “People are going to have to pay good money, but in return they get a house within walking distance to campus in most cases.”
The parent company, Rent Like a Champion, 
started at the University of Notre Dame, where football season brings droves of out-of-town fans.
It was a huge success, so the program ex-
tended to Pennsylvania State University and now UF.
Out-of-town groups paid about $2,000 per 
weekend at Notre Dame, and Baralt imagined the price will be similar in Gainesville.“It depends how far away the house is and 
which game day weekend they’d like to visit,” said Baralt, a 22-year-old sociology senior. “The idea is you want to work with the demand of the weekend — more people would want to see UF vs. Florida State University than UF vs. Western Kentucky.”
Those renting out their houses would pocket 
most of that money. For example, Baralt said, if a house rents for $2,500 one weekend, the full-time occupants could pocket between $1,800 and $2,100.
Also, if an occupant rents his or her house out 
14 times or less during a year, he or she doesn’t have to disclose that information in taxes.
“It’s no different than you leaving town for 
a weekend and letting a friend stay at your place,” he said.
Coty Berdugo, a 21-year-old accounting mas-
ter’s degree student, thought the money he’d get for his five-bedroom, two-bathroom house, which is less than a block away from campus, makes the service attractive.
Berdugo has sold parking in the past for 
between $10 and $20, but never gave much thought to renting out his entire house.
“It might be kind of odd to let people you 
don’t know sleep in your bed,” he said. “But for the money, we could work it out.”

Police have found a Gainesville High 
School student who had been missing since 
May 25.
Marissa Jade DeVito, 16, was found in 
one of her classmates’ apartments Friday by a GHS school resource officer.
DeVito spoke to Jordan Keeter, 18, dur -
ing lunch at school May 25 and asked him if she could stay at his place over the weekend, said GPD Officer Nate Ellis, GHS school re-source officer.
He said DeVito said she never intended 
the stay to last as long as it did.One officer spent three days working to 
find her.
Ellis found DeVito at Keeter’s apartment 
in southwest Gainesville after he was tipped off by a school resource officer at Buchholz High School.
The BHS school resource officer was told 
by an Alachua County Sheriff’s officer who was given a note by an anonymous woman while he was eating lunch.
Ellis said she ran away because of issues 
with her father.
Police said they were able to determine 
that she was at Keeter’s apartment of her own free will.
As of Friday, there were no outstanding 
charges, and DeVito is with her father again.

OXON HILL, Md. — Snigdha Nandi-
pati heard a few words she didn’t know 
during the National Spelling Bee, but nev-er when she stepped to the microphone.
Calm and collected throughout, the 
14-year-old from San Diego spelled “guetapens,” a French-derived word that means ambush, snare or trap, to win the 85th Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. 
She beat out eight other finalists in the 
nerve-wracking, brain-busting competi-tion.
After she spelled the word, she looked 
from side to side, as if unsure her accom-plishment was real, and, oddly, she was not immediately announced as the winner. Applause built slowly, and a few pieces of confetti trickled out before showering her. Then her 10-year-old brother ran on stage and embraced her, and she beamed.
“I knew it. I’d seen it before,” Nan-
dipati said of the winning word. “I just wanted to ask everything I could before I started spelling.”
A coin collector and Sherlock Holmes 
fan, Nandipati aspires to become a physician or neurosurgeon. She also plays violin and is 
fluent in Telugu, a lan-guage spoken in south-eastern India.
A semifinalist last 
year, Nandipati be-came the fifth consecu-
tive Indian-American winner and 10th in the last 14 years, a run that began in 1999 when Nupur Lala won and was later fea-tured in the documentary “Spellbound.”San Diego teenager wins

Playground Bully
Zero-tolerance policies 
can harm students
Recently, Florida’s controversial “Stand Your Ground” 
law has raised some serious discussions about the abil-ity of people to defend themselves or others in violent 
or aggressive situations.
While more and more laws across the country seem to af-
firm Americans’ right to defend themselves, the policies of public schools appear to be moving in the opposite direction.
In April of this year, a 9-year-old boy named Nathan Pem-
berton was suspended from his elementary school due to a bullying incident, but he was not the bully.
Instead, Nathan decided after weeks of being bullied that 
he was going to fight back. After a kid kicked him in the back and punched him in the face, Nathan punched his aggressor.
Due to an illogical zero-tolerance policy, the school sus-
pended Nathan for becoming involved in the physical alter-cation.
Instead of allowing school officials to use their judgment 
on each issue, zero-tolerance policies make self-defense a punishable action.
In May, another incident sheds even more light on the ab-
surdity of high school policies related to bullying.
Stormy Rich, an 18-year-old student at Umatilla High 
School in Umatilla, Fla., was riding a middle-school bus to school after having earned enough credits to skip her first-period class in high school.
While riding the bus, Rich witnessed incidents of bullying 
against a mentally challenged middle-school girl by a group of other students.
After Rich reported the bullying to both the bus driver 
and school officials, the incidents continued. She decided she would tell the girls that if they did not stop harassing the other girl, Rich would have to handle the situation herself be-cause it appeared the school wasn’t going to do anything.
On May 4, school officials sent a letter to Rich’s mother 
calling Stormy a bully for telling the girls to stop. Rich also lost her ability to ride the middle-school bus to school.
Schools across the country have similar zero-tolerance 
policies related to these issues.
They create a one-size-fits-all response to bullying, school 
fighting and other related incidents. But they completely dis-regard the facts, situations and people involved.
Policies that punish students for reasonably defending 
themselves put them in potentially horrible scenarios. If stu-dents try to get away, they could risk serious injury from their aggressors. If they fight back, they will likely be suspended with a tarnished academic record.
Zero-tolerance policies take all thinking out of school ad-
ministration and discipline, but it’s about time someone starts thinking about the unintended consequences of punishing those who stand up for themselves and others.Americans shouldn’t ignore soda servings
A good rule of thumb is to never tell New Yorkers what to do.
But Mayor Michael Bloomberg is certainly try-
ing.
Last week he proposed a ban on the sale of “any cup 
or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 fluid ounces — about the size of a medium coffee, and smaller than a com-mon soda bottle,” according to an article by The New York Times.
The ban wouldn’t pertain to diet sodas, juice, drinks that 
are mostly dairy-based or anything alcoholic. It wouldn’t af-fect drinks sold in grocery or convenience stores, but it would affect places like delis, fast-food restaurants and sports are-nas.
“New York City is not about wringing your hands; it’s 
about doing something,” Bloomberg said. “I think that’s what the public wants the mayor to do.”
According to a report from Reuters, Bloomberg said, “You 
can still be a beast. We’re not keeping you from eating fatten-ing foods or drinking 32-ounce bottles of full-sugar drinks,” but rather “just telling you that this is detrimental to your health and making you understand that by portion size.”
He might think it’s what the public wants, but it’s not 
what large companies want. (I’m about to quote some tweets at you, and I’m kind of sorry about it.)
Friday morning, the official McDonald’s Twitter account 
said, “@MikeBloomberg We trust our customers to make the choices that are best for them.”
As former Newsweek social media editor Mark Coatney 
pointed out on his blog, companies like Philip Morris and Countrywide Financial also preach a similar message to that of McDonald’s, but that doesn’t make it any more correct.
A few hours later on Friday , the official Twitter account 
of the Coca-Cola Co. said, “Unlike @MikeBloomberg, @Co-caColaCo thinks #NewYorkers can make their own choices about what they drink. #NYC deserves better. ^AB”
The “AB” at the end of that tweet, in case you were won-dering, are the initials of Ashley Brown, the director for digital communications and social me-dia at Coca-Cola. He’s just one of five users in charge of producing tweets for Coke.
Not for one second do I believe 
these companies are actually and legitimately concerned for their consumers’ right to make choices. 
They are only worrying about their bottom line: sales.
If people start to feel guilty because they have to buy more 
cups of soda (instead of just one soda in a large cup), then they will eventually stop buying so much out of shame. That means trouble for companies whose livelihood depends on people putting toxic substances into their bodies.
“Bloomberg is right to focus on the problem, but really , 
the target here is not so much the consumer but the corpo-ration,” said Ernie Smith, editor of ShortFormBlog, a news aggregate website at which I’m a staff writer. “If you lim-ited the amount of corn syrup one could get from an average meal at Mickey D’s, rather than the portion size, you’d get much further.”
America’s obesity problem is basically proving that ig-
norance is truly bliss. The longer we ignore the problem, the less time we have to spend worrying about the fact that we’ve entirely brought this whole thing on ourselves.
So while large companies are arguing that Bloomberg’s 
ban isn’t the way to solve the public’s health issues, I’m not exactly sure if they’d ever completely agree with limiting consumption.
We don’t need cups of soda the size of buckets. We just 
need to be aware of the serving sizes of the poisons we put in our bodies.

Unite Party is limiting Student Body’s 
right to free speech
Last Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting 
was a historic moment for UF. It marked the passage of Senate Bill 2012-1046, a bill that infringes on every UF student’s fundamen-tal right to speak his or her mind.
Though vaguely worded, the bill prohib-
its any UF student from voicing opinions on upcoming elections through any medium — even personal Facebook posts are included — until just one week before the election.
What can you do during the 50 weeks 
there isn’t an election on campus? You’re not allowed to speak about either party’s plat-form or candidates without risking disquali-fying them.
I, a freshman unafﬁ  liated with either par-
ty, was absolutely shocked to see so many prominent Unite leaders at Tuesday’s meet-ing speak in favor of abridging my rights.
Unite Senators Christina Bonarrigo, 
Cayman Weimer and others said that they are limiting your free speech for your own good. It sounds as though they don’t want to be held accountable for when they don’t work for you.
They are afraid of being challenged. 
When earnest students try to make their opinions heard, as I did on Tuesday, they shoot us down with vitriol and accusations of partisan politics.
This isn’t about petty partisanship. This 
is about the Unite Party’s attempt to shut out free discourse and dissenting views by limit-ing our ability to discuss elections, platforms and candidates.
And so far, it’s worked. We’ve let it work.
Isn’t it great to be a Florida Gator?

Recent budget cuts cause confusion
I’m confused by what the UF administra-
tion is doing to cover the $38.2 million cut in state funding. Dean Colson, the chair of the Board of Governors, the highest govern-ing authority of the State University System, said “… reduction will be restored to the baseline next year,” and that “Our Universi-ties will continue to tap their reserves year-round in order to save …”
Recently, Florida Senate President Hari-dopolos said that the reductions to state university funding were one-time cuts that should be addressed with reserves. I un-derstand UF being upset about the reduced state funding, but I don’t understand why they are so blind to the reasons for it.
Imagine if you have $50,000 in a savings 
account and your boss just told you that next year you’ll be making $25,000 less but the year after, you will get your full salary back. Do you go out and sell your car and house, and kick out your kids? No, you spend your savings and make sure your full salary is re-stored next year.

It’s close to nine months since Occupy Wall Street 
came onto the scene and caused a stir by peacefully sitting in Zuccotti Park. In this time, several different 
Occupy groups have sprung up around the nation.
I remember going to Milwaukee in November for a 
convention and stopping by Occupy Milwaukee. The weather was frosty and my ﬁ  ngertips were chilled to the bone. Yet here was a group of people who had built a whole community and, despite the weather conditions, were standing their ground. 
One of the biggest criticisms of the Occupy move-
ment was its lack of demands. Yet once presented, it seemed media continued to hark this point. However, what I think the media didn’t press upon was the effect that the Occupiers had upon the general population. Their demands no longer became important. Instead, the reaction toward the Occupiers by the ones in power was what became highlighted in the mass media.
In national news I began reading about mass arrests, 
pepper spraying and general police brutality. The pow-erful picture of Dorli Rainey, an 84-year-old Occupy Seattle activist, with pepper spray covering her face as two men attempted to wash it off, has been ingrained in many people’s minds. What threat did Rainey pose to the police? It makes one wonder about the hyper-power that the ones at the top hold and the ease in which they are willing to apply violence to their own citizens.
The incident at University of California, Davis has 
sparked outrage. The student protesters had linked arms and overstayed their welcome, which prompted the ar-rival of the police. The protesters were vocal and stood their ground. Still, the ofﬁ  cers lined them up, sat them down, and sprayed them with pepper spray . An ofﬁ  cer walked back and forth several times, keep-ing the the nozzle close to the students’ faces. These protesters by that point had submitted and were sitting down. Was this response from the ofﬁ  cers 
justiﬁ  ed? Of course it wasn’t. These students had a right to assemble and speak their minds.
The vehemence displayed while dealing with these 
protesters brought about a stark contradiction in the ac-tions of the respective parties. While the protesters re-mained calm, the authorities showed their ugly side.
The abuse of power from the authorities resulted 
in lending credence to the movement. It exploited the contradictions of peaceful versus the powerful, the poor versus the rich, and of course the truth versus the lies.
You can disagree with Occupiers and their stances. 
You can call them whiny , unhygienic or lazy . However, you can’t deny that since their movement started, the level of awareness of the U.S. citizen has risen. 
The Occupy movement may have not made a drastic 
impact on our social order, but we have to acknowledge the sheer dedication to the cause. 
As citizens we are powerful and, as the Occupiers 
have taught us, we can’t be cowed by the authorities.
Remember, there is strength in numbers.Michela Martinazzi is an art history junior at UF. Her

It is of some concern that the pronoun “they” is constantly 
used to refer to the government. If the United States is a government of, by, and for the people, then shouldn’t the 
pronoun “we” be more appropriate?
Of course, “we” sounds both odd and confusing, but this 
absurdity is revealing.
Americans are not incorrect in referring to the government 
as “they;” indeed, the government has become something oth-er than us.
As the United States arose as an unmatched global power 
from the ashes of World War II, the military made a transition from “we” to “they.”
On Memorial Day, I reﬂ  ected on whether or not the recent 
actions of U.S. troops are reﬂ  ective of the will of the American people, and if not, for how long has this been true?
Most importantly, it must be clear that troops cannot be 
judged based on the actions they perform. Vacuous catch-phrases like “Support our Troops” dangerously eliminate the distinction between U.S. policymakers and the soldiers who are ordered to do their bidding.
At a time in our nation’s history when the national security 
apparatus is larger than ever before, it is the duty of American citizens to critically assess the status and necessity of our mili-tary power. Upon such reﬂ  ection, it becomes apparent that the United States is trapped in a vicious cycle.
Today, American troops must “defend our freedom” be-
cause we have withheld the promise of freedom from so many 
for so long.
We have exerted our military 
might not only in the pursuit of physical defense, but for economic 
gain. Examples include the Philippines, Nicaragua, Honduras, Cuba, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Cambo-dia, Laos, East Timor, Indonesia, El Salvador, Afghanistan and Iraq — the list is disturbingly long.
Our victims are not happy.Since 1952, the U.S. military has killed an estimated 8 mil-
lion people. Since 1775, the United States has suffered 2,489,335 casualties of war. These numbers speak for themselves.
We must not allow holidays like Memorial Day and Veter-
ans Day to dilute our dedication to justice. It is not a contradic-tion to support our troops — that is, the individual men and women in uniform — and stand opposed to the unjust actions they often carry out in the name of our government.
Our troops are acting under the orders of “them,” not 
“us.”
Many may suggest that it goes against proper taste to make 
such claims around Memorial Day, but I could not think of a better time. The Department of Defense reports that 128 ser-vice members have died in Afghanistan this year.
If we wish to have fewer troops to memorialize this time 
next year, then we cannot cease to be critical of “them” until “we” no longer sounds so unusual.

Speaking OutDjeri charged Miller to prevent him from shooting again, but 
Miller ran away with his gun in hand.
The two got back in the car, and as Colson turned north onto 
23rd Street, Miller fired at her car again.
Djeri knocked on neighbors’ doors and told them to call 911. 
Colson flagged down a police officer.
Colson was shot in the neck, but police said her injuries are non-
life threatening. The 15-year-old girl was unhurt.
Gainesville Police Department and Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office responded to the scene, and officers marked off perimeters.
Miller remained barricaded inside his apartment for 10 to 15 
minutes, firing out of the apartment’s windows.
No police officers were hurt, and they did not shoot back.
Miller then walked outside and gave himself up to police.After he was handcuffed he began to convulse.Miller was taken to Shands at UF.When GPD officers went inside to clear the apartment, they 
found Miller had turned on the oven full blast and turned on all the faucets so that the apartment was starting to flood. They also found a bottle of sleeping pills by his bed.
“This was a very scary incident for all officers involved,” Valuri 
said.

A refurbished Satchel’s Pizza 
will open June 14 after a fire in 
February closed the landmark pizzeria for three months.
The restaurant’s kitchen, 
which suffered about $150,000 in damage, has been redesigned to promote efficiency in serving customers, said restaurant owner Satchel Raye.
“We decided to take the op-
portunity when we’re down to fix some things,” Raye said. “There were problems with the flow for our employees.”The restaurant has added a 
convection oven, a third pizza-making station and two more feet of gas oven space. That’s enough room for two more pizzas, Raye said.
The bar in Raye’s Lightnin’ 
Salvage junk shop next door has been moved and expanded. The restaurant’s dining room and serving area were undamaged, but have been painted and reor -
ganized.
“We’ve actually added about 
200 square feet [to the restau-rant],” Raye said.
The restaurant will resume its 
normal hours of 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. A T-shirt commemorating the fire will be sold starting at the reopening.
Raye expects the restaurant to 
be fully staffed next week. Only two members of his 50-employee roster won’t be returning to the restaurant.
Jonathan Dickens, a full-time 
Satchel’s employee for about three years, will return next week. The restaurant gave him three week’s worth of pay from an online fundraising account made for the closed restaurant’s employees.
Dickens said that’s what’s 
bringing him back.
“Honestly that fund saved my 
life,” he said. “I would have had my power turned off if it weren’t for that.”Satchel’s Pizza will reopen June 14

Avenue, reflects on the newly renovated kitchen Monday afternoon. 
� IT PAIRS STUDENTS

A UF program that will 
help some students transi-
tion into their field of choice is once again accepting appli-cants.
All underrepresented sec-
ond- and third-year UF stu-dents majoring in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) have un-til Friday  to apply for Gator Launch.
Gator Launch is a pro-
gram hosted by UF’s Career Resource Center that pairs students with professional mentors and offers activities to enhance professional de-velopment.
To apply, students must 
fill out an application form and submit a one-page es-say and an updated resume, which can be done by email or in person. 
The application form can 
be found on the CRC’s web-site.
After Friday, students will 
still be able to apply on a roll-ing basis. “Gator Launch is a mentor -
ing and education program that is designed to provide students with an opportunity to network with a mentor in one of the STEM fields,” said Gator Launch coordinator Kertesha Riley.
Members of the program 
will get a grasp of what being a professional in their field of choice is all about.  
Gator Launch also aims 
to enhance students’ profes-sional skills.
Christine Schaefer, a 
21-year-old materials sci-ence and engineering senior, joined Gator Launch for the networking opportunities.  
Students can converse with 
their mentors as often as they like either in person, by phone or by email, Riley said.
“My mentor taught me the 
business aspect of engineer -
ing,” she said.
Schaefer was accepted to 
Gator Launch for both her sophomore and junior years. She said she appreciated what the mentor program did for her.
“Gator Launch is a learn-
ing tool for students wanting to learn the basics of the in-dustry and how to act profes-sionally,” she said.Gator Launch eases

Some routes would extend to weekends
on Second Avenue to 12th Street 
where buses can pick up students near Norman Hall, Sorority Row and along Museum Road.
The route would also have three 
buses running.
Route 27 would have a Sunday-
only service to the airport.
Several routes under the consid-
ered changes, however, would no longer be running.
Robinson said the 400 bus ser -vice, which includes Routes 401, 402, 403, 406 and 407, would no longer run on weekends. Instead, weekday routes – Routes 1, 6, 9, 10, 25 and 35 – would run on Saturday with Routes 15 and 20 added on Sundays.
Route 303, also known as Later 
Gator D, which runs from down-town Gainesville to FloridaWorks at Southwest 13th Street, would stop running on Thursday and Friday nights because of low usage, Rob-inson said. The route would still be available on Saturday nights.“The decision to remove week-
day service on this route had a lot to do with this route overlapping Route 13, which runs late on week-days,” Robinson said in an email. “Route 13 has had higher ridership than [Route] 303.”
Bus routes going through Santa 
Fe College also face hour and fre-quency reductions due to funding cuts by the college.
RTS is accepting questions and 
comments about the changes until June 12. Residents can submit their concerns at http://go-rts.com/.

 The Gators proved they were 
worthy of the nation’s top overall 
seed in the ﬁ  rst weekend of post-season play — or at least the No. 1 ranking in the NCAA Gainesville Regional.
  Florida dominated Bethune-
Cookman and Georgia Tech with a balanced attack bolstered by effec-tive starting pitching en route to a fourth consecutive Super Regional berth.
  After failing to capture a third 
straight Southeastern Conference title during the regular season, the Gators’ play in the ﬁ  rst round of the postseason was a far cry from their mid-season slump.
  “I think this team, to be honest 
with you, is probably tired of hear-ing about how people have not thought they’ve played up to their potential,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We’re the No. 1 national seed, and we’re using that as motivation moving forward.”
  A great deal of Florida’s success 
during the week was the result of stellar starting pitching. Dating back to the Auburn series at the end of the regular season, Gators starters have lasted ﬁ  ve innings or more in every start but one. However, the group raised the bar during the Regional.
  Jonathon Crawford kicked off 
the weekend with a no-hitter against Bethune-Cookman on Friday night. Crawford fanned ﬁ  ve batters and walked one facing the minimum of 27 batters.
  The sophomore right-hander also 
proved his durability by throwing a career-high 98 pitches and hitting 98 mph on the radar gun in the ninth inning.
  “Crawford did an unbelievable 
job pitching,” Wildcats coach Jason Beverlin said Friday . “Probably an understatement.”
  Hudson Randall followed Craw-
ford’s outing with a solid start. He scattered eight hits in 5.2 innings, but surrendered only one run to an offense that had averaged 8.6 runs in its last ﬁ  ve games.
  Arguably Randall’s most im-
portant out Saturday was Yellow Jackets ﬁ  rst baseman Jake Davies in the bottom of the third. After home plate umpire Mike Morris ruled that Mike Zunino had caught a foul tip off Davies’ bat for a third strike, the Gators left the ﬁ  eld.
  However, the umpiring crew 
overruled Morris and decided the ball had hit the dirt, putting Davies back in the batter’s box with runners on ﬁ  rst and second in a 1-1 game.

 UF starters key in NCAA Regional sweep
FIRE JOE MORGAN
 Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan said he 
is considering four starters for the three-man rotation in the NCAA Su-
per Regional. If O’Sullivan is wise, Jonathon Crawford will crack the ﬁ  nal trio.
  After tossing a no-hitter against Bet-
hune-Cookman last Friday, Crawford 
proved he is a go-to guy on Florida’s pitching staff. He is not the go-to guy — 
see Randall, Hudson — but nonetheless, Crawford is vital to the Gators’ success from here on out.
  What makes Crawford dangerous is his 
motivation.  Last season, O’Sullivan left him off the 
Florida roster that traveled to Omaha, Neb., for the College World Series.
  “It was a very tough decision, but it was 
one that we felt like needed to be made,” O’Sullivan said.
“He went off the Northwoods League, 
never complained, got his 50 innings in, came back (and) was much improved this fall. (He) was very open-minded to some changes and has worked extremely hard.
  “I’ve been hard on him, and on top of 
that, now we’ve asked him to have multi-ple roles this year. … Now we’re 12 months later, and he’s start-ing the ﬁ  rst game of the regional, and he throws a no-hitter.”
  C r a w f o r d 
watched the Gators lose to the Game-cocks in the College World Series ﬁ  nal 
on television. He was patient, and he used his missed chance to compete for a nation-al title to fuel his success in 2012.
  “It’s not a good feeling being left be-
hind while your team’s going to Omaha,” Crawford said. “So, I just wanted to go out [last] summer and work really hard and contribute to the team and help them get to Omaha again.”
  Crawford kicked off the Gators’ bid for 
a third straight College World Series with a no-hitter, but it wasn’t just a run-of-the-mill no-no.
  Former Diamondbacks starter Edwin 
Jackson walked eight batters and logged 149 pitches while holding the Rays hit-less in June 2010. Any pitcher is capable of stumbling upon greatness.
 Crawford gaining momentum in rotation as postseason progresses    JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 With Jonathon Crawford’s 
no-hit bid on the line, Carlos Delgado lined a 3-2 pitch right at Casey Turgeon.
Turgeon jumped in the 
air and snagged the ball, se-curing the ﬁ  nal out in Craw-ford’s no-hitter.
His acrobatic play at sec-
ond base earned Turgeon the second spot on the ESPN SportsCenter Top 10 list.
  “If it was hit on the 
ground, I would’ve sat in front of it — I would have worn it for him,” Turgeon said.
  Despite a no-hitter Friday 
and a 15-run outburst Sun-day, the Gators’ defensive ef-fort in the NCAA Gainesville Regional received its fair share of recognition.
Turgeon, Nolan Fontana, 
Josh Tobias, Daniel Pigott and Justin Shafer all made successful diving plays for Florida during the ﬁ  rst round of postseason play last week-end.
  An errant throw home by 
Shafer on Saturday marked Florida’s lone error.  “They shrink the ﬁ  eld on 
you on defense,” Bethune-Cookman coach Jason Bever-lin said Friday. “So, the balls we did hit hard, with their defense as good as it is, it just shrinks all the gaps and the amount of space to get hits.”
  Georgia Tech coach Dan-
ny Hall said UF played “tre-mendous inﬁ  eld defense.”
  During the weekend, 
the Gators 
p i t c h i n g staff relied h e a v i l y on ground balls. Thirty of the 81 outs Florida r e c o r d e d 
against Bethune-Cookman and Georgia Tech rolled through the inﬁ  eld grass, in-cluding 13 in Crawford’s no-hitter Friday.
  “Usually, when you pitch 
to contact, balls ﬁ  nd your de-fenders,” Gators coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
  Nolan Fontana, Turgeon 
and Josh Tobias ﬁ  elded the majority of the grounders and combined for 24 assists.

Starters recorded 0.92 ERA
Three pitches later, Randall got 
the strikeout on a changeup.
“Runners on first and second in 
a big situation early on in the game, 
I didn’t want to give up any more runs,” Randall said. “[Going back on the field] worked out well for us because I was able to go out there and get the strikeout, and … all the momentum was on our side.”
Brian Johnson started Sunday 
and gave up one run on three hits in five innings. Other than a rocky third inning, Johnson dominated Georgia Tech and probably would have pitched deeper into the game had it not been a blowout.
Florida gave Johnson the most 
run support during the weekend with 15 runs in the first five innings. The Gators went to the bullpen for the final four frames in a 15-3 win.
“Brian gave us a great start,” 
O’Sullivan said. “We got an early 7-0 lead, and Brian continued to throw strikes.”
Heading into the Super Regional, 
Florida has a stout starting rotation to pit against NC State. Karsten Whitson, who struck out two bat-ters in a scoreless frame Sunday , remains in the mix with Crawford, Randall and Johnson.
“No, I have no idea at this point 
(who the three starters will be),” O’Sullivan said. “There’s four guys that we can use, and we’ll get to that later on in the week. You can prob-ably figure out the four guys.”

Florida retired 30 batters on ground balls
Baseball America 500, and O’Sullivan 
has referred to Turgeon as a “natu-ral” on the field.
However, O’Sullivan came away 
from the weekend most impressed with Tobias’ defensive effort at third base.
“Josh Tobias has done a really, re-
ally good job,” O’Sullivan said. “His first step on a couple of balls to his left this weekend were really, really good.
“He saved some balls that maybe 
earlier in the year may have gotten by him, but he’s kind of really solidified that infield.”
Florida’s glove work in the field 
helped account for a productive weekend from its starting rotation.
Crawford, Hudson Randall and Brian Johnson each had effective out-ings and earned victories during the weekend.
They gave up a combined two 
earned runs on 11 hits with two walks and 14 strikeouts in 19.2 total innings.
Had it not been for Florida’s 14-
run lead against Georgia Tech after the fifth inning, Johnson may have pitched more than the five frames he logged Sunday.
“It’s unbelievably easy to pitch 
(with good defense),” Johnson said. “You almost get mad at yourself when you throw a ball.”
During the regular season, the 
Gators had one of the strongest de-fensive units in the Southeastern Conference.
Florida registered the second-best 
fielding percentage in the SEC (.978) and committed the third-fewest er -
rors (52).
If the Gators’ on-field performance 
during the NCAA Regional contin-ues in the Super Regional, then a re-turn trip to the College World Series in Omaha, Neb., this season seems likely.
“Everybody talks about our pitch-
ing, everybody talks about our of-fense and our power, but our defense is really good,” O’Sullivan said.

MIAMI  — Chris Bosh has been 
telling the Miami Heat that he’s 
ready to play. The Heat seem ready to listen.
And Game 5 of the Eastern Con-
ference finals — which wouldn’t be lacking for drama with Boston and Miami tied at two games apiece — may have another significant layer of intrigue.
Bosh’s status was upgraded to 
“day-to-day” by Heat coach Erik Spoelstra on Monday, the first de-viation by the team after more than three weeks of simply saying his absence was indefinite because of a strained lower abdominal muscle. 
Spoelstra wouldn’t guarantee 
that Bosh plays in Game 5, but opened the door to there at least being a chance of the All-Star for -
ward-center suiting up.
“He’ll get a vote,” Spoelstra 
said of how much Bosh’s input will matter in determining when he takes the floor. “Again, everything is heightened right now. These are extreme circumstances. Everybody will be involved in the decision, if and when it happens. But you always have to take the player’s opinion with a grain of salt. They all say they’re ready . ... He said he was ready 10 days ago.”
The Celtics were ready for him 
then, too. So if Tuesday is the Bosh comeback night, Boston will not be caught off-guard.
“We don’t have to do anything different,” Celtics coach Doc Riv-ers said. “We’ve prepared every game like Bosh is going to play . And eventually, he will.”
Bosh was watching from the 
bench for the two games in Boston, where the Celtics managed to tie the series by following largely the same formula — building a big lead, then holding on at the end.
“No one said it was easy ,” 
James said. “This is great. This is what the postseason is all about. It’s about adversity and ups and downs. Like I said, you never get too high and you never get too low. We look forward to Game 5.”
They’ll especially look forward 
to it if Bosh gets the all-clear sign on Tuesday. Bosh has had several on-court workouts in the past week, and Spoelstra said he was going to evaluate him again Monday.
Bosh was injured late in the first 
half of the opening game in the In-diana-Miami second round series on May 13. In the nine postseason games since, Miami has gone 5-4. If he can play, the Heat would wel-come whatever Bosh can provide, even if that means working a key player back into the lineup to face Garnett and Boston’s frontcourt in the midst of a playoff series.
“We couldn’t win without him 
for two years. And not only could we not win without him, we looked horrible without him,” Spoelstra said. “So I think that was the big-ger challenge. If and when we ever get to that point, we’ll gladly take that challenge.”
Crawford’s start against the Wild-
cats was nothing short of dominant.
Granted, he handcuffed fourth-
seeded Bethune-Cookman, but the 
way he was pitching, Crawford would have toyed with the likes of South Carolina and UCLA.
The sophomore right-hander 
threw first-pitch strikes to 19 of the 27 batters he faced. During the ninth inning, his fastball was clocked at 98 mph. The only player Crawford al-lowed to reach base was thrown out trying to steal second.
“I guess the stars aligned for me,” 
Crawford said.
If that’s the case, somebody up-
stairs really likes Crawford. He has posted a 2.92 ERA and a .242 batting average against in 13 starts.
In his last four starts, he has 
pitched 23.1 innings with a 1.16 ERA and a 2.88-to-1 strikeout-to-walk ra-tio.
The more he starts, the deeper he 
pitches in games. As his innings pile up, his effectiveness continues to sharpen.
He’s not going to throw another 
no-hitter this postseason, but I doubt he’ll surrender much more.
Crawford’s a stone-cold killer, 
and he’s heating up at the right time for Florida.
Put Crawford in, coach O’Sullivan: 
he’s ready to play.

As the Gators head to Des Moines, 
Iowa to wrap up their season at the 
NCAA Outdoor Championships, jumper Ciarra Brewer will be wrapping up her first season with a new coach. Despite the transition in coaches, the freshman had a strong year. 
“It’s been really good,” Brewer said. 
“I’ve experienced not doing so well and then finally trusting my coaches and trusting their word because it’s been the first time I’ve been coached by someone other than my dad. He’s been my coach since I was four.”
But for Brewer, competing at a col-
legiate level without her dad’s coach-ing her wasn’t the only thing she had to adjust to. At the beginning of the outdoor season, Brewer’s new coach Brian O’Neal suggested changing her technique.
“At first I didn’t want to change my 
technique because I was so used to be-ing a double-arm jumper,” Brewer said. “So when coach (O’Neal) brought up this new technique, I said ‘No, I don’t think I should because I just know how to do double arm. I don’t think I can do this.’”
Brewer had reasoning behind her 
initial resistance. In her first meet as a Gator, she placed second in the triple jump and fifth in the long jump. 
She then went to have four top-
five finishes during the indoor season in both events, including a runner-up performance at the Southeastern Con-ference Indoor Championships in the triple jump.
Once she changed her technique, her 
performances just added to her doubts. At her first three meets of the outdoor season, Brewer failed to break the top five and even fouled out at the Florida Relays. However, Brewer continued to trust O’Neal.
After the rough start, Brewer went 
on to grab two wins in the triple jump at the Drake Relays and the SEC Out-door Championships. In addition to the win, her mark of 13.58 meters at the SEC ranks second in the nation. 
“It just boosts my confidence some 
more,” Brewer said. “Just being able to see that I jump well with this new tech-nique because at first I thought, ‘OK, nothing’s really changing, it’s the same thing.’ But finally I saw its benefits. I’m so thankful and grateful.”
At the NCAA East Preliminary 
Round, Brewer finished fifth in the triple jump with a mark of 13.30 me-ter. Although it wasn’t her best perfor -
mance in the outdoor season, Brewer was still satisfied with the outcome, which was good enough to extend her postseason.
“My main focus was just to make 
sure I made top-12,” Brewer said. “It didn’t really matter how well I jumped, just as long as I was in the top 12 so I could come back at nationals. Then whatever I needed to fix I [would] fix in the two weeks we [had] off.”
The Gators will be competing in 17 
individual events and two relay events. Marquis Dendy (long jump), Tony McQuay (400 meter), Lanie Whittaker (400m), Darshay Davis (100 meter) and Genevieve LaCaze (steeplechase) will start off the meet on Wednesday for Florida.
