The Student Government ballot has  
changed, and the Taco Libre Party may launch 
a write-in campaign to compensate.In a ﬁ  nalized list of candidates released 
Monday, the only party whose ofﬁ  cial presi-dential and vice presidential candidates made it onto the ballot was Swamp. The Taco Libre Party’s presidential candidate, Stephanie Kre-itzer, and vice presidential candidate, Juan Za-pata, were not listed.
The Students Party did not run an execu-
tive ticket this Spring. The only executive can-didate now running for the Taco Libre Party is treasurer hopeful Mica Montero.
Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover said 
the removal of the two executive candidates reﬂ  ected the vice presidential candidate’s fail-ure to qualify properly. Zapata did not turn in the correct information.

Student veterans in Gainesville are reacting to 
two new pieces of legislation that could affect their 
tuition.
The GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act, which received 
a unanimous vote of 390-0 in the House, will allow 
veterans to choose the school of their choice by re-
quiring all public universities to offer in-state tuition for student veterans.
Although many state universities provide waiv-
ers to out-of-state veteran students, schools in Flori-da are not included in this list, despite Florida having the third largest veteran population in the nation, ac-cording to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
In response, a similar piece of legislation is going 
through the Florida State Senate. Senate Bill 84 will require all Florida state universities or college system institutions to waive out-of-state fees for veterans.
UF and Sante Fe College’s Collegiate Veteran So-
ciety and UF Student Government are planning to take a trip to Tallahassee to attend a press conference and speak to legislators today about the bill, said Marcus Tucker, the society’s vice president.  
“[If the GI Bill Tuition Fairness Act is passed] 
that makes the legislation that’s going through the state right now all that much easier because all they Bill could lower 
veterans’ tuition

A peculiar critter control problem plagues Anthony Rue 
and his neighbors: Drawn in by the allure of acorns, vicious 
wild hogs regularly invade his yard.
Rue, owner of Volta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate, lives north of 
Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park near La Chua trail. 
Nearby, Casey Whitford and his wife Sarah Cervone, own-ers of paleo business Wild Man Foods, have been trying to help residents of the area control the hog population for three years.
“(The hogs) are an extreme nuisance,” Whitford said.Wild hogs not only destroy private property but also are 
a danger to the environment because they eat essential native plants, Whitford said.
There are more than half a million feral hogs in Florida, 
according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Con-sumer Services website. 
The hogs populate every Florida county, said Karen Parker, 
the regional public information coordinator for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Committee. When residents call the FWC, they are referred to a nuisance wildlife trapper in their area, who usually charges a fee to remove them.
“We don’t have a critter-getter service through us,” Parker 
said, adding that although the FWC gets a lot of phone calls Wild hogs going HAM in yards, parks near Paynes PrairieAll Swamp candidates qualiﬁ  ed“As the supervisor of elections,

The Reitz Union Auditorium is 
generally full of the eager chatter 
of Preview students or the laugh-ter of Gators catching a midweek movie. But on Monday night, the 
only sounds were the voices of ﬁ  ve 
survivors and the quiet sobs of the audience. 
Survivors of the large-scale mas-
sacres that have been plaguing Syria since 2011 shared their stories at Voices from Syria: Survivors Speak Out, an event hosted by UF’s Arabic Cultural Association and Amnesty International. 
President Bernie Machen opened 
the event, calling the conﬂ  ict be-tween President Bashar al-Assad and those who oppose his regime “one of the most pressing conﬂ  icts of our time.”
The men and women spoke of 
mothers hugging their dead sons and daughters and of doctors who had no choice but to watch children die. 
“What we are here for today is… 
to tell a little, small part of what is going on there [Syria], and we want you to pass the message,” said 
Amineh Sawan, a 23-year-old who survived a chemical weapons attack. 
“We want you to tell the truth.”
Riham Hamed, a UF statistics se-
nior, said the event was powerful.
“They weren’t just people in Syr-
ia. They’re actually activists,” she said. “They stood up for their people around them.”
Sameer Saboungi, UF Arabic 
Cultural Association president, said the speakers are a testimony to the Syrian people’s resilience. 
“My personal hopes are that this 
event can help educate people about one perspective on the situation in Syria and give a voice to the people 
from inside Syria,” he said.

Some of them worked for 
months in the dirt. They spent 
hours clearing the plot, build-ing up the soil, watering the plants and covering them dur-
ing freezes.
So when University Police 
investigated the theft of more 
than $2,700 worth of produce at UF’s Organic Gardens coopera-tive, gardeners said what they lost transcended a price tag. 
“You know, there’s really 
not a dollar value on it,” said 
Ginny Campbell, plot coordi-
nator at the garden.
The thefts lasted from Oc-
tober to January, but on Thurs-day, UPD ﬁ  led sworn com-plaints against a woman from Sorrento, Fla. The complaints charge 25-year-old Caitlin M. Fogarty with several counts 
of theft, criminal mischief and 
dealing in missing property.
The thefts started out small 
— just rows of seedlings at ﬁ  rst. The plants varied: kale, romaine, fennel. Soon, Camp-bell said, entire rows of plants disappeared. Cabbage, carrots and swiss chards went miss-
ing. Some immature plants 
were ripped out and left on the ground. Other plants were trampled on. Even tools like wheelbarrows and buckets were missing. But Campbell said the thefts 
were sporadic. 
Giacomo Ciani, the garden’s 
co-president, said a suspicious van steered police in Fogarty’s direction. On Jan. 4., one of the 
last gardeners to leave said she 
noticed a brown van parked to-ward the entrance. He said she thought it was strange because gardeners usually parked by the plot.  She snapped a picture, and police found out Fogarty was driving the car.
“The license plate was the 
real game-changer,” Ciani said.
Ofﬁ  cers went to Fogarty’s 
home to interview her, where she said she stole from the garden ﬁ  ve times. She sold the items at a produce market in Mount Dora, UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber wrote in a statement. 
When ofﬁ  cers found Foga-
rty, Campbell realized the two had exchanged several emails in March 2010. Fogarty wanted a plot in the garden. 
When a spot opened, Camp-
bell emailed her but said she couldn’t remember if Fogarty ever took the plot.  
Christine Noonan, a UF 
animal science senior, is vice president of the garden. The 23-year-old said ofﬁ  cers are discussing security measures for the garden, but it is doubt-ful any will be taken.
“Nothing like this has ever 
happened before,” Noonan 
said. “We don’t really expect 
anything like this to happen again.”Police: Plotting thief 
took from UF gardenwould be doing is becoming compliant 
with federal law,” said Matthew Davis, a 26-year-old UF finance graduate and former president of the veteran society.
Davis said he thinks veterans don’t 
deserve to be treated differently when they come to Florida.
“I didn’t have to compromise my life-
style when I separated from the military because I was given in-state tuition rate,” Davis said. “But my buddies who were veterans who didn’t were eating Ramen Noodles every day.”
The current bill funding veterans’ tu-
ition, Post-9/11 GI Bill, covers all in-state tuition costs and fees, but for out-of-state students, tuition and fees are capped at the national in-state maximum rate.
The 2013-2014 UF in-state tuition rate 
is $208.77 per credit hour. Out-of-state tuition is $951.34 per credit hour.
Veteran Danny Makowsky Jr., a 
29-year-old UF political science junior,  believes UF will comply with the bill be-cause it has always been veteran-friend-ly.
“We all raised our right hand in oath 
to defend our country with our life, not 
the state of Florida,” Makowsky said. 
“Some of these people in high places … are looking at the dollar sign. I don’t think that’s where the focus should be.”about the hogs, its budget and lack of equipment prevents fur-ther intervention.
The Wild Man Foods duo 
works with trappers, a butcher and the occasional dog to cap-ture the hogs and get the meat 
ready to sell at the Union Street 
Farmers Market downtown.  The pair traps them for free.
An entire yard can be de-
molished in one hour. But from trapping the animal to getting the meat in the cooler, taking down a hog requires an average of six hours, Whitford said.
Wild hog traps are 6 feet by 
10 feet, big enough to restrain a 300- to 400-pound beast with razor-sharp teeth. Experienced trappers rely on the direction of the wind and the presence of acorns, a hog delicacy, to catch the feral swine.
“They’re like full-on Marl-
boro men,” Cervone said.
Acorns are the root of Rue’s 
problem. After placing a wild-life camera in his yard, Rue witnessed one male hog, about three females and 15 piglets violently foraging for nuts and leaving deep holes in their wake. Rue estimates the ditches 
in his yard are about 10 yards 
by 30 yards.
Before Whitford and Cer-
vone could get to the hogs, the acorns were gone, and the hogs with them.Rue said though hunters 
may be the only way to stop the invasion, they may be partially responsible for the animals mi-grating closer to city limits.
“It draws them into urban 
areas where they shouldn’t be,” Rue said.
The hogs are becoming an 
increased threat to private prop-erty owners, too.
“It looks like a bomb hit 
when they come through,” Whitford said.

A new Florida-based social media ap-
plication focused on group interaction 
launched today.
Klique, founded in Naples, is a photo 
sharing and chat messaging social network that revolves around small, close-knit groups of friends.
Chris Franco, Klique’s co-founder and 
chief marketing officer, said this is the first social app with the goal of perfecting the group social experience.Klique allows groups of up to six friends 
to chat and share photos within the pri-vacy of their group or publicly with their 
followers. Each group will have its own 
name, and its followers will see photos and comments on a feed similar to Instagram.
“We all have our group identities, but there’s no real outlet for that in social media,” Franco said. Rachel Leeman, a 21-year-old UF biochemistry senior, said 
she could see her group of friends using 
the app.
“I like the idea that you can be in your 
own private group,” she said.  “You can share things with a select amount of people and see what everyone says about it.”
Talia Medina, a 21-year-old UF telecom-
munication senior and the campus ambas-sador for Klique, said the app allows users 
to control who sees their media. 
“You can either be public or private,” she said. “If it’s public, it gets posted. You 
can see stuff that I’ve posted and stuff my Klique has posted.” 
With features like group-to-group mes-
saging, Franco said the app is designed to connect people with similar interests.
“Talking to someone on a social network 
one-on-one is kind of weird and awkward, but with this it’s almost like you have a social wingman,” he said. “In real life, if you were with a group of your friends and you went up and started talking to anoth-
er group of friends, it’d be so much more 
comfortable and normal.” App combines chat, photo sharing, privacy for group messaging

After a 2-year-old giraffe was 
shot and killed Sunday morning at 
a Denmark zoo, some UF professors 
and students are calling it harsh and unnecessary.
News organizations reported 
that dozens of families watched as Marius, a healthy reticulated giraffe, 
was publicly shot, skinned and fed 
to the lions and other animals at the Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark.
The European Association of Zoos 
and Aquaria recommended that the zoo administration put Marius down 
due to the existence of several other 
giraffes with similar genes in the or-ganization’s breeding program.
Michael Moulton, a UF associate 
professor of wildlife ecology and conservation, said he understands 
the zoo must consider how to keep 
its animals genetically healthy.
“I wouldn’t question the people 
that did it on scientific grounds,” he said. “Having said that, I don’t sup-port how they did or where they did 
it. I think it was a little harsh.”
Edward Braun, UF associate pro-
fessor of biology, agreed. He said that the inbreeding concerns were le-gitimate, but he did not see the need 
to kill the animal.
“I think the goal of avoiding in-
breeding is a good one,” said Braun. “I question whether this was good from the standpoint of the educa-
tional mission of the zoo, which is 
equally important.”
The giraffe was killed using a bolt 
gun, not a lethal injection, so the ani-mals that ate his remains wouldn’t be poisoned. Zoo visitors, including 
children, were invited to watch the 
giraffe’s body get skinned and fed to lions, tigers and leopards as an edu-
cational experience.
The Copenhagen Zoo chose to 
put down the giraffe despite an online petition with almost 30,000 
signatures and several offers from other zoos and individuals to adopt 
the giraffe.  The zoo administration 
has since received numerous death threats, and animal rights groups are 
calling for a boycott of the zoo.
Rebecca Laines, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology freshman, said that she didn’t understand why killing the 
giraffe was necessary.
“It’s just disgusting,” Laines said. 
“They could have given the giraffe to another zoo. They didn’t have to kill him.”Experts, students react to

able to place someone on the ballot who failed 
to qualify,” Hoover wrote in an email.
Kreitzer said she considered appealing the 
decision but isn’t sure it will be approved. If not, she will focus on a write-in campaign.
“We know that if we’re not on the ballot, 
we’re going to get significantly less votes than for a write-in campaign,” she said. “But the point in the election is to make a difference for students … and if we can make students more interested in student governments, then we’ve accomplished our goals.”
Because the president and vice president are 
a joint candidacy in SG, Hoover said, disquali-fication of one leads to disqualification of both.
Kreitzer said she thought the executive can-
didates had qualified. She said she found out about the disqualification Monday morning.“Hearing that today, two weeks after the 
qualifying period, that’s really surprising,” Kreitzer said. “We were under the impression qualifying was submitting the 300 signatures supporting us on the ballot.”
Swamp Party spokeswoman Susan Webster 
wrote in an email that the situation came as a surprise to the party, but its campaign strategy has not changed in response.
“Our entire ticket including our presidential 
and vice presidential candidates will continue 
to reach out to the entire Student Body to en-
sure Swamp Party is advocating on behalf of all students’ interest,” she said.eleCtion , from page 1“You can share things with a

After investigators closed the 
dig site where they’d hoped to ﬁ  nd 
the body of missing UF student Tif-fany Sessions, the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce is continuing to col-
lect tips for further investigation.
The site, just past the intersec-
tion of U.S. Highway 441 and Wil-
liston Road, was closed Thursday 
evening after heavy rainfall, said 
Michael Warren, director of the 
C.A. Pound Human Identiﬁ  cation Laboratory at UF. 
He said it could always be re-
opened in the future if needed.
But that doesn’t mean the search 
is over, said ASO spokeswoman Sgt. Becky Butscher.
She said public announcements 
about the case Thursday brought 
in some phone calls with potential 
leads. The department will follow up on those tips as they occur, she said.
“Any bit of information from 
this point on will be helpful,” Butscher said.
ASO named deceased serial 
killer Paul Rowles as its formal sus-
pect Thursday. Sessions, a 20-year-
old UF ﬁ  nance junior, went for a 
walk down Williston Road on Feb. 9, 1989, and never returned.
Patrick Sessions, the father of 
the student who went missing 25 years ago, said the recent two-week excavation of the area was inspired by two factors. The body of Elizabeth Foster, a 
UF student whom Rowles killed two years after Sessions disap-peared, was found there. 
Secondly, when investigators 
brought forensic search dogs to the site during the summer, Sessions said, the dogs raised a red alert. They barked frantically, dug holes and jumped into them.
“That was the reason we were 
as enthusiastic as we were to exca-vate that site,” he said.
The team waited for cooler 
temperatures and started digging about two weeks ago. But they discovered old sewage tanks from what was once an illegal trailer park. The tanks were leaking fumes that confused the dogs.  
“Some of the same smells that 
come out of septic tanks come out of bodies,” Sessions said.
After closing the dig site, Ses-
sions said, he thought the search was thorough. He said he felt com-fortable his daughter’s remains are not in the immediate area. 
“It doesn’t mean we won’t go 
back,” he said. “It doesn’t seem there’s any urgency to go back.”
Butscher emphasized that be-
cause Rowles is dead, there are no consequences of sharing leads in the case. She said people should understand they don’t need to be scared to speak up about any de-tails they recall.
“There’s no retribution,” she 
said.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

write-in campaign 
idea is doomed
People don’t take write-in candidates seriously.
The very notion of running on a write-in basis smacks 
of desperation, or worse, an inability to mobilize — not 
exactly a message politicians want to send to voters. And even 
write-in campaigns with big names, like Ralph Nader’s 1992 
write-in candidacy in the New Hampshire primaries, aren’t 
guaranteed wins.
For example, in UF’s Spring 2013 Student Government 
elections, write-in candidates included “Charles Barkley,” “Barack Obama,” “Tim Tebow and Jesus,” “Ronald Reagan,” “Hulk Hogan,” “GUcci Swag,” “Nicolas Cage,” “Charman-der,” “Batman” and “Butt-Head.”
Other, more tongue-in-cheek write-ins included, “This s**t 
is stupid,” and “Idiotic Waste of Money.”
“Great attitude, awesome charisma and very well-round-
ed person” was another notable UF write-in — maybe they thought the ballot was a Chick-Fil-A comment card?
Members of the much-talked-about Taco Libre Party at UF, 
with its single goal to bring Taco Bell back to the Reitz Union, may now be reduced to a write-in campaign after the party’s VP candidate failed to properly ﬁ  ll out necessary paperwork. Now, only the Taco Libre treasurer candidate will be on the ticket. 
While we normally would prefer to hold the party that fails 
to do its paperwork accountable, the idea of Swamp Party running unopposed is a tough pill to swallow. For the sake of checks and balances, a deadline extension in this situation doesn’t seem out of line.
In the meantime, the write-in campaign is a risky move. 
After all, you’re asking a Student Body of thousands to cor-rectly spell “Stephanie Kreitzer” on a ballot — the same Stu-dent Body that includes people who couldn’t spell Carly Rae 
Jepsen correctly as a write-in during last year’s election.
At the end of the day, are fringe movements — in the con-
text of UF politics — worth the effort? Was the Taco Libre Par-
ty meant to be a statement about the way Student Government is run? While it may seem like a stretch to give the Taco Libre Party this much credit, it’s very likely that its single-platform approach was meant to be less an attempt to bring Taco Bell back and more a comment on the ridiculousness of the Swamp Party’s reign over UF. But we have serious doubts about the 
success of a brand-new party that has to fall back on running 
a write-in campaign. Was the Taco Libre Party, then, all for nothing?
If Taco Libre is meant to be an anti-establishment statement, 
it’s a novel but ineffective tactic. Like past fringe movements, such as the often-mocked and dubiously named “The Rent is Too Damn High” Party, it’s destined to fade away unless its leaders take serious steps to mobilize and gain momentum.
For now, all we can assume is that Taco Libre is just a blip 
on the UF radar. In the end, it was all sound and fury, signify-ing nothing.

Syria is rife with civil unrest. Many archaeological sites 
have been looted, museums are being damaged, and artifacts are being stolen. During times of war, cul-
tural heritage is left defenseless. Islamic landmarks like the Umayyad Mosque, the old city of Aleppo and the Krak des Chavaliers — a crusader castle — have all been damaged by bombs and theft.
The Syrian government has assigned ofﬁ  cials to look for 
the lost artifacts, although the number of objects that will actually be found cannot completely rectify the damage. What can be done to protect the people and their history? Well, this isn’t the ﬁ  rst time history has encountered such a situation.
When most people think of Athens, they think of the 
glorious days of war victories, opulence, art, music and philosophy. Some may even think of the Parthenon, one of Greece’s greatest treasures. However, in the late 17th cen-tury, Athens was under siege by the Venetians.
The Parthenon was used by the Ottomans as a gunpow-
der store room, and despite its resilience, a ﬁ  red mortar found the monument’s Achilles’ heel and blew up a good portion of the famous structure. Most of the well-preserved antiquities of Athens were looted or destroyed due to war and turmoil. By 1800, about half of the original sculptures were still standing.
In 1805, British ambassador Lord Elgin traveled to 
Greece and saw the dilapidated state of these once mag-niﬁ  cent works of art and architecture. Attempting to pre-serve these pieces of art under the impression that Greece would not, he procured marble statues, legally paid for them and brought them back to Britain. Eleven years later, these marbles were acquired by the British museum and have remained on public display there since.
Greece, however, has something to say about that. Al-
though Lord Elgin obtained these artifacts legally, Greeks believe these marbles really belong to them and should be returned to their country.In 2009, the Acropolis Muse-
um opened and showcased many of the Acropolis’ beautiful arti-facts, including a running frieze sculpture from the Parthenon. The parts of the sculpture that remained in Greece are on dis-play, yet there are several miss-ing pieces, thanks to Lord Elgin’s acquisition. 
The missing pieces remain in the British Museum.There is no way, then, to appreciate these sculptures in 
their entirety; they are separated by about 2,000 miles.
Where should these sculptures be: Greece or Britain? Do 
the Greeks have the right to obtain the art of their past? If this holds true for Athens, then shouldn’t this hold true for all artifacts from all countries all across the world? Should the Louvre return all art that is not French? Should the Smithsonian give back all works that are not American?
Is the Wal-Mart idea of a museum — having everything 
in one place — completely unethical? Or is obtaining mate-rial culture from a country during its time of distress un-ethical?
Syria is currently in a delicate state in which its histori-
cal artifacts are being looted, taken, destroyed and illegally sold. Years down the line, would we see this as a better-ment for human history, or is this the metaphorical rape of Syria’s cultural past?
UNESCO’s assistant director-general for culture Fran-
cesco Bandarin put it simply and beautifully to NPR: “Well, you see, we think that heritage is part of human life. It’s not a separate thing. Culture is part of human iden-tity. Now if you take away heritage and identity to people, they’re really deprived of a very fundamental part of their humanity.”

Letter to the Editor
Swamp Party’s Spring platform
It is my pleasure to announce that 
Swamp Party has ofﬁ  cially set its Spring 
2014 campaign platform. 
In building this year’s platform, we 
sought to combine both the students’ needs 
with the expertise of our candidates. 
It is our belief that this process has 
yielded a platform that is comprehensive, 
dynamic and truly seeks to serve all stu-dents here at the University of Florida.
Since Swamp Party was founded in Fall 
2012, its leaders have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the students at the University of Florida, and this year’s plat-
form is an excellent representation of this. 
We have taken what we have heard 
from students and come up with four main 
categories to focus our platform on.
These categories consist of student life, academics, safety and transportation and 
student organizations. 
Each category was molded to ensure 
that we are able to meet the multitude of 
students’ needs across campus.
From now until the election on Feb. 18 
and 19, our candidates will be out every day helping familiarize students with our platform. 
We urge all students who are interested in ﬁ  nding out more about our platform or 
who have questions to come ask a Swamp 
Party volunteer! 
A more comprehensive list of our plat-
form can also be found at swamppartyuf.
com.
As always, we are together for tomor-
row!

Like most 
students, I rarely pay 
attention to UF politics. How-
ever, when some-
one promises me there’s more than 
what meets the 
eye, I try to under-stand what’s going on.
A few months back, Dave 
Bradshaw, then a graduate stu-dent, asked to meet with me. I agreed to meet outside the Re-itz one Sunday evening. I knew Bradshaw could give me an in-
valuable, albeit biased, look into 
the inner workings of student politics at UF — he had, after 
all, been a campaign manager 
for a minority party — but little 
did I know what was coming.
Bradshaw was ﬁ  nishing his 
master’s in political science and agreed to send me his academic papers on UF campus politics. When I got my hands on them last month, I realized his re-
search was irrefutable, with ex-
tensive interviews with people from all conﬂ  icting factions. 
The ﬁ  ndings are shocking. 
The 92 pages of detailed re-search in Bradshaw’s paper, which includes references to past Alligator articles, revealed how unelected representatives 
from powerful fraternities meet 
secretly to pick the upcoming year’s Student Government’s senior positions, how threaten-ing intimidation tactics are used against those who speak up and how SG leaders have used an elite leadership honorary to perpetuate their power — ille-
gally, in at least one case. 
With my column space be-
ing limited and the average at-
tention span even more so, let me highlight just one case. 
There are usually two con-
testing parties in SG: the ruling coalition popularly known as “the System” and an opposing 
one known as the “indies.” The 
System consists primarily of Greek groups along with a few minority organizations.  For de-cades, the System has dominat-ed campus life in ways shadier than most know.
The Greeks are divided into 
three powerful groups: the “social bloc,” led by Sigma Phi Epsilon until the frat’s suspen-sion compelled leadership to be reportedly trans-ferred to Zeta Tau Alpha; the “po-
litical bloc,” led by 
Theta Chi; and the “third bloc,” led 
by Alpha Epsilon 
Pi. Ever since their 
last defeat in 2004, the blocs of the System present a united front come election time. 
Every year, ﬁ  ve or six repre-
sentatives from each bloc meet secretly at what former Stu-dent Body President Ben Mey-
ers calls “the Room,” and they 
“start horse-trading,” accord-ing to Bradshaw’s paper. 
“Everything is on the table,” 
said another Theta Chi alum-nus.
Citing political consultant 
Roger Austin, Bradshaw men-tions how the presidency is rotated between the blocs “as part of an ongoing agreement.” The secret negotiations in the 
Room not only result in picking 
the vice presidency and trea-sury candidates, but they also include — according to Mey-ers and another former System leader, Nick Stinnett, in the re-search paper — making deals on positions in the upcoming executive cabinet and other SG 
leadership agencies.
Most students, including 
Greeks, are clueless of the nep-
otism behind the scenes. 
Johnny Castillo, an opposi-
tion candidate in 2013, had no idea throughout his time in Sig Ep that his frat was the power-house at the time of the “social 
bloc” and said, “No one talks 
about [the bloc system] because that would be division. Think about it: If I was a part of Chi Phi [one of the less inﬂ  uential fraternities], and I found out that we were the s**ttiest of one of the blocs, I would want to know why.” 
Other aspects of the highly 
concealed corruption in UF pol-itics should be in next week’s column. 
Until then, be nice to the 
folks campaigning on Turling-ton. They may be as equally clueless as the rest of us.

opinions@alligator.orgOne good quip that came from 
John Mayer’s song “The Heart of Life” was “Fear is a friend who’s 
misunderstood.”
Often, we want to avoid what scares 
us — like when we hide from someone we know in a grocery store, but often we 
would be better off if we just said hello.
Now, I am a very nervous person. I 
can’t go through a day without my heart 
racing somewhat from everyday interactions. As Lesley Kinzel of xoJane elegantly said, I go through 
life “feeling awkward and inept at things but doing 
them anyway.”
But since I know this about myself, I purposely sit 
with my fear, feel it and do what scares me anyway. 
If I didn’t, I would constantly stay in my room im-
mersed in a book, a TV show or Tumblr.
Doing what scares you gives time depth. All of 
the moments I have spent living within my comfort zone have blurred together. It is the times when part 
of me wanted to run away that I remember the most 
distinctly and fondly.
Fearing fear can be unproductive because it can 
mean avoiding change. Change can be a stressful 
stimulus, which causes a chain reaction in the brain 
that results in the release of chemicals that cause the racing heart, fast breathing and energized muscles you experience.
Change is also essential to keep life moving. 
Whether it means beginning or ending a relation-ship, starting or quitting a job or relocating to a new state, your brain can’t discern between positive and negative stress, so your body is still going to react to 
the fear even if the change will beneﬁ  t your life.
In fact, even good things like marriage and vaca-
tions are listed on the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, a common test for measuring stress.
Sometimes we fear change because 
it involves letting go of something else. And as humans, we hate loss — just 
watch the Jimmy Kimmel prank where parents joke about taking away their children’s Halloween candy.
In your case, you may have already 
put many hours into a major you now realize you hate, but you may feel as 
if ﬁ  nishing is the best option. If you change majors now, it would feel as if you’ve lost time and effort. 
This can also apply to relationships: You may try to 
keep mending a doomed relationship because you fear moving on. But in reality, you haven’t wasted any time.
You spent that time living and learning, and now 
it is time for change.
As living organisms, we can’t completely avoid 
change and fear; they are inevitable. The best thing we can do is accept them.
Allow yourself to feel the effects of fear. Do all 
the crying, kicking and screaming you need to, and don’t judge yourself for not being optimistic initial-ly. But after you’ve let it all out, don’t stay in the past 
reminiscing on what was. Focus on the future — and 
what can be.
How many things have you missed out on be-
cause the idea of them made you too scared or un-comfortable? Challenging your fear is not going to 
kill you — unless your fear is bungee jumping off of 
a bridge and the cord breaks.
But overall, challenging fear can be rewarding.Maybe the cord won’t break as you feared. Now 
you have an awesome story to tell.

Valentine’s Day Eve just got sweatier.
UF RecSports is hosting free Valentine’s 
partner yoga and salsa classes Thursday at Southwest Recreation Center.
The serene yoga and sizzling salsa ex-
periences are open to any student or Rec-Sports membership holder and significant other or a friend. Attendees can also choose to be matched with a partner at the event.
The yoga and salsa special events will 
last from 8:30 to 10 p.m. in activity rooms one and three, said Raphael Konforti, a fit-ness graduate assistant at Southwest Rec.
Only one participant is required to reg-
ister for either event, but those bringing a friend must include their partner’s infor-
mation.
Konforti said that in addition to expos-
ing new people to group fitness, the Valen-
tine’s events are great for regular partici-pants who attend yoga and dance classes 
like Zumba and hip-hop fitness.  
“There are a lot of poses that you can’t 
do when you’re by yourself that you can 
do with a partner,” Konforti said. 
Southwest Rec’s coordinator for fitness 
programs Leah Dupuie said partner salsa allows participants to “express your dance 
style in a different way.”
Camille Baumrucker, an 18-year-old 
UF health science freshman, said she and 
her friends go to regular yoga sessions at Southwest Rec “a couple times a week” 
and are looking forward to Thursday’s 
yoga event.
“It sounds like it’s going to be fun to 
step outside of our comfort zones and try 
something like partners’ yoga,” Baumruck-
er said. “I’m really looking forward to it.”RecSports goes romantic with V-Day partner yoga and salsa
� THE MUSEUM HAS 
NEW BUTTERFLIES.

UF’s butterfly exhibit will 
soon include two continents. 
The Florida Museum of 
Natural History’s Butterfly 
Rainforest exhibit is intro-ducing a new theme, Butter-
flies of Africa, on Saturday.
Museum marketing and 
public relations coordina-
tor Kaitlin Gardiner said this theme will bring in ex-
otic species such as Forest 
Queens, Flame-bordered 
Charaxes and Black Sword-
tails.
Every six weeks, the mu-
seum changes the theme of 
the exhibit and ships in a 
new crop of butterflies, she said.
Michael Boulware, a living 
exhibit specialist at the mu-
seum, said most butterflies live naturally for two to three 
weeks, so precautions must 
be taken to make sure the 
butterflies live long enough to inhabit the exhibit.
“When people are sending 
us a chrysalis, they refriger-ate it,” Boulware said. “They pack it in cold packs to ship it so that they don’t age chron-
ologically during that time. That way, we have as much 
shelf time as possible.”
Mitul Patel, a 20-year-old 
UF biology junior, said he 
heard about the new theme 
and enjoyed his previous museum visit.
“I would definitely be in-
terested in going,” he said. 
“I would on a nice Saturday 
afternoon.”Exhibit spreads wings
� IT COULD UP RISK OF 
HEART DISEASE.
ERICK EDWING
Alligator Contributing Writer
A sweet tooth can have 
some seriously sour conse-
quences.
According to a recent study, 
eating sugary snacks can dou-
ble the risk of dying from heart 
disease.
The Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association In-ternal Medicine’s February study found that U.S. adults who consume 25 percent of their daily diet in sugar were two times more likely to die 
from cardiovascular disease as 
people who limited their sug-ar intake to 7 percent of their daily diet.
Amber Wilhoit, a dietician 
at UF, said college students are prone to consuming a lot of sugar without even realiz-ing it.
“Coffee or soda for that ex-
tra pick-me-up are the main culprits,” Wilhoit said. “You’re essentially drinking one half of your suggested calories for the day.”
But not every student 
seems to fear the possibility of a death by heart disease from consuming too much sugar.
Melanie Berra, a 20-year-
old UF sociology sophomore, said she is fond of her sweets.
“Ice cream gives me life,” 
Berra said. “In all seriousness, I guess it’s good to balance what you eat. Ice cream is re-ally good, though.”
Wilhoit said the stress of 
college is a factor in some stu-dents’ poor diets.
“I think it’s not even realiz-
ing what you’re eating,” Wil-hoit said. “Even fruit juices or sweet tea contributes a lot of sugary calories.”
Other students such as Al-
yssa Xedus, a 20-year-old UF international studies sopho-
more, said calories and sugar 
aren’t on her mind when she goes out to eat with friends.
“When I’m with other peo-
ple for coffee or lunch, I’m not self-conscious about what I had,” Xedus said. “When I get home though, I ask myself why I just did that to my body.”Study: Sugar is riskyCAMPUS

Oprah’s “O” is recognizable any-
where. Say, “You’re fired,” to any 
American, and it will conjure up 
visions of dirty-blonde toupees and failed presidential nominations.
But two UF juniors are trying to 
make sure students know personal branding isn’t just for celebrities.
Luis De Las Salas and Katie 
Burns have started their own non-profit personal branding agency 
because they said they realized an 
overflowing resume isn’t enough to make students stand out anymore  
— it has to have character.
Luis + Katie Personal Branding 
aims to create memorable brands for individual students in order to make 
them more marketable to potential employers.
Burns said she hopes the service 
will “help students better their pro-fessional selves and creative digital 
identities.”
Personal branding is a relatively 
new strategy that helps facilitate self-promotion in a job market satu-
rated with social media. For Luis + Katie Personal Branding, that means 
resumes, headshots, logos and cov-
er-letter coaching.Public relations major Burns and 
advertising major De Las Salas, both 21, got the idea for the business at 3 a.m. one night when De Las Salas 
was playing around with Adobe 
Photoshop. Burns took a peek at De Las Salas’ work and complimented 
it.
A light bulb went off, and now 
they’re getting compliments from clients.
“What I like about what they’ve 
done is that they’ve added another personal dimension to things that 
are usually business-like,” said 21-year-old UF Spanish senior David 
Soto, who hired them to re-work his 
resume.
Clients can hire Luis + Katie Per-
sonal Branding through its Facebook page or by emailing lkpbranding@gmail.com.
Burns and De Las Salas always 
sit down with their clients and get to know them before they begin any work. On a recent project for their 
friend Andrew Kays, the pair brain-
stormed how to best convey Kays’ personality and strengths through 
a logo.
They wanted to know, “What 
makes Andrew, Andrew?” said De Las Salas.
Andrew is scientific and higher-
thinking, he said, so Luis + Katie Personal Branding designed a logo 
to look like an element on the peri-odic table — with Kays’ graduation 
year as the atomic number and his 
phone number as its weight.
Burns and De Las Salas have 
branded their own business as a young, outgoing and service-orient-ed agency. All of Luis + Katie Per-
sonal Branding’s profits will go to 
a new charity every quarter, Burns said.
Their first beneficiary will be 
Dance Marathon. But so far, they haven’t charged their clients a 
penny; they’re still determining the 
price. 
Burns said the agency is nonprof-
it because the design duo is getting just as much out of the experience as its clients.
“We’re helping people out and 
still learning from the whole pro-cess,” she said.Students to sell personal branding

UF students have more opportunities than 
ever to build their knowledge of 3-D printing 
technology.
UF science librarian Sara Gonzalez, who 
helped create a proposal to get new printers, 
said Marston Science Library and the Health 
Science Center Library will have two new 3-D printers within a month.“I hope students can get comfortable in the 
library,” she said, “and then move forward to 
the Fab Lab.”
UF’s Art and Architecture Fabrication Lab-
oratory, known as the A2 Fab Lab, has provid-
ed 3-D printing in UF’s architecture building 
since 2009, said Matt Chandler, the manager 
of the A2 Fab Lab.
“This is a wave that’s been coming for a 
long time,” he said. “Now it’s going into some-thing that average people are asking for.”The MakerBot printers coming to UF’s li-
braries will have a lower resolution, which 
means less detailed prints and a lower cost of 
printing in comparison to the A2 Fab Lab.
The two new printers, retailing at about 
$2,200 and $2,800, are funded by UF technol-ogy fees and will allow all UF students to bring a file and print whatever they want for a cheaper price, Gonzalez said. Prices are based 
on time spent and materials used.
Jennifer Curtis, associate dean for research 
and facilities in UF’s College of Engineering, 
said she believes 3-D printing is the future.
“I think it’s huge,” she said. “It really has 
the ability to transform small business and manufacturing.”
Gonzalez said a website will be launched 
within a month to give students more infor-
mation about the new printers.
“It gives you the ability to print something 
out, hold it in your hand and look at it,” she 
said.Two new 3-D printers are comingTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

While residents are bundling up to cope 
with lower temperatures this winter, mana-
tees are finding warm refuge of their own.
Biologists at the Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission recently reported a count of about 4,800 manatees in warm areas along the east and west coasts of the state, ac-cording to a news release.
Gil McRae, director of the FWC’s Fish and 
Wildlife Research Institute, said it’s the third highest count the organization has recorded.
The survey is useful for tracking the mini-
mum population count, but it can’t indicate whether the population is increasing or de-creasing.
“All we can say is that the count increased, 
and that’s reflective that the weather got cold 
pretty quickly, and more manatees sought out 
warmer water,” McRae said.
The FWC could not conduct the survey for 
the past two years because the temperature did not decrease enough to push the majority of the manatees from the colder ocean waters into the warmer natural springs and man-made power plants, said Holly Edwards, a manatee biologist for the FWC. To accurately 
count the manatees, the conditions must be 
right. The FWC looks for a series of cold fronts followed by a warm, sunny day.
“Some years we get that, and other years 
we don’t,” Edwards said.When the water drops to less than 68 de-
grees Fahrenheit, manatees migrate toward 
the springs and power plants, said Robert 
Bonde, a research biologist for the Southeast Ecological Science Center in Gainesville.
“These are wild, free-ranging animals the 
size of an elephant that literally choose to come and swim in your backyard,” Bonde said.Rhett Barker, a 20-year-old UF wildlife ecol-
ogy and conservation sophomore, swam with the manatees at Crystal River Preserve State 
Park about a week ago. He said there were 
about 700 manatees in the series of springs where he was swimming.
“It was amazing,” Barker said. “It’s like 
swimming with a friendly truck.”
Barker, who films videos of wildlife under-
water, said he appreciated the animals’ friend-liness.
With most animals, he said, “The problem 
is that they try to get away from you. But with manatees, I have the problem that they are so friendly most of the time that I have to con-stantly swim backward or all I’ll film is this gray square of manatee skin.” Thousands of manatees seek refuge from weather off coasts

Amateur and professional paleon-
tologists from 28 countries will travel to 
Gainesville this weekend to share and discuss their research.
The 10th North American Paleonto-
logical Convention, hosted by the Florida Museum of Natural History, will be held at the Hilton conference center from Fri-day to Tuesday. So far, 450 attendees have registered, and more are expected as the convention’s opening grows closer.
The convention is the only one on 
the continent exclusively for paleontolo-gists, said Troy Dexter, a post-doctoral 
researcher in the Florida Museum’s in-
vertebrate paleontology program.
“Because most of us get our degrees in geology, biology and different kinds of larger groupings, we tend to attend con-ferences in those larger groups,” Dexter said.
He said the event will be comprised 
of talks beginning at 8 a.m. followed by a poster session at 4:45 p.m. where 28 presenters will set up booths of research for attendees to browse and discuss. Each day will host a group of presentations.
Students like Sahale Casebolt, one of 
the UF graduate paleontology students slated to present at the convention, are 
rushing to finalize their presentations be-
fore the event.
“I’m scrambling to finish everything,” 
she said. “But that’s pretty typical.”
Casebolt’s presentation focuses on 
paleontology’s effects on modern animal conservation.
Other interested students can pay 
$400 to register for the entire conference 
or $125 to register for a single-day pass.Prehistoric convention at UF

UF is in the running to take the 
title of “favorite vegan-friendly

The title, given by peta2, the 
People for the Ethical Treat-ment of Animals youth division, launched voting for the title last week. The first-round voting pe-riod ends Wednesday. Students can cast their votes at peta2.com.The contest includes 32 univer-
sities, all of which have already received A’s on peta2’s Vegan Report Card, but only two cham-pions — one large school and one small — will win the title. 
The winners will be announced 
March 31.
Kenneth Montville, peta2’s 
college campaign coordinator, said this year’s competition gives students a chance to advocate for their schools.
“This year, we’re not just go-ing out and praising schools 
that we think do a job. We are listening to students’ feed-
back, and this in 
turn sets a stan-dard for schools all around the 
country,” Montville said.
According to the report card, 
UF’s high points include dining halls that promote vegan options, participate in Meatless Mondays and offer a totally vegan station. 
UF dining halls also provide 
vegan and vegetarian dining guides for on-campus restau-rants.
Criteria on the report card that 
UF doesn’t meet include having a vegan member on its student advisory board and an all-vegan dining facility.
Amanda DeArmond, a 
20-year-old UF psychology ju-nior, said she experimented with being vegan and found the cost and time to be the biggest deter-rents. She said campus options often don’t make the cut.
“You really have to prepare 
and make meals to bring to cam-
pus,” DeArmond said. “I don’t 
have a meal plan, and the other vegan choices on campus are su-per expensive.”
The closest UF has come to 
winning peta2’s competition was in 2011, when it placed second in the large university category.
UF in competition for favorite vegan-friendly college title“All we can say is that the count 
increased, and that’s reflective that 
the weather got cold pretty quickly, 
and more manatees sought out 
warmer water.”
Gil McRae
Fish and Wildlife Research Institute director 
“It gives you the ability to print 
something out, hold it in your hand 
and look at it.”

With about one month left un-
til the NCAA Tournament kicks 
off, No. 3 Florida is 21-2 — its 
second-best start in program his-
tory — and leads the Southeast-ern Conference with a 10-0 league record. The Gators are on a 15-
game winning streak and have 
won their conference games by an average margin of 13.2 points.
But Billy Donovan is keeping 
things in perspective. 
With national attention in-
creasing on the Gators, Donovan does not want his players to get wrapped up in polls or records. 
“I don’t know the national 
part; I don’t read a lot of that stuff,” Donovan said after Flor-
ida’s 78-69 victory against Ala-
bama on Saturday — a win that did not see the Gators’ best effort defensively. 
“I’m sure our guys do. But if 
that stuff could help our team in any way get better, I would lay it out in their lockers so they could read all the stuff that’s out there. 
But it really doesn’t have any-
thing to do with anything. 
“Right now, I talk to them a 
lot about distractions. There’s al-
ways distractions out there. Even 
the distraction of moving to [No. 3] in the country or being 10-0 or winning or the home streak —

For the past few days, the 
Marcus Smart fiasco has had 
college basketball fans in an 
uproar.
Since Smart pushed a 
heckling Texas Tech fan dur-
ing the late moments of his 
team’s loss Saturday night, 
critics have condemned the Oklahoma State guard for his behavior and lack of self-control. 
The sophomore has begun 
to earn the contentious label that Metta World Peace (for-merly Ron Artest) and other 
examples before and after 
him have seen stick with their careers.
But Billy Donovan, who 
coached Smart with the U.S. 
national team, does not view 
him as a troublemaker. When asked about Smart on Mon-day, the Florida coach sym-
pathized with the Cowboys 
point guard and called the situation “unfortunate.”
“Obviously, I think as 
[Oklahoma State coach Travis 
Ford] mentioned, he crossed 
the line; it’s something he shouldn’t have done,” Dono-
van said. “But I think, to echo 
what Travis said, he is a great kid. I never had one bit of a problem with him, coaching 
him for the two years with 
USA.
“I remember the first year 
we had him, there were a 
couple of games where we 
were up by 30, 40 points at halftime. I told him because we had to play five games in a row, I said, ‘Marcus I’m 
not playing you in the second 
half.’ ... ‘No problem, Coach, whatever I can do to help.’ He’s always been that kind 
of kid. 
“What people saw from 
him in that situation against 
Texas Tech to me is totally uncharacteristic. I never 
saw anything like that, ever, 
coaching him.”
On Sunday, the Big 12 
suspended Smart, Oklahoma 
State’s leading scorer with 
17.5 points per game, for three games for pushing the fan.
But Saturday night was 
not an isolated incident for Smart. 
After picking up his sec-
ond foul during the first half 
of a victory against West Vir-
ginia on Jan. 25, Smart walked to the bench and repeatedly kicked a chair in frustration.

iber talent, Smart decided to Donovan comments

With the regular season approaching its 
conclusion, the Gators find themselves in 
good standing.
To earn a bid to the NCAA tournament, 
finishing in the top half of the 14-team Southeastern Conference — the confer-ence with the No. 1 RPI in the country— is 
essentially a must. 
Florida (17-7, 7-4 Southeastern Confer-ence) is currently sixth in the SEC, trailing 
five ranked opponents — No. 5 South Car-
olina, No. 8 Tennessee, No. 14 Texas A&M, 
No. 16 Vanderbilt and No. 19 LSU.
No. 18 Kentucky, which UF beat 86-80 
on Sunday, is seventh in the conference with a 5-5 SEC record. 
Barring a monumental collapse, Florida 
should have a spot in the top seven locked up. 
Alabama — currently eighth in the con-
ference — has an SEC record of 4-6, tied with Auburn and Georgia. Florida has the head-to-head advantage over Kentucky, Alabama and Auburn. 
With the Gators 
on the verge of making their first appearance in the NCAA tournament 
since 2011-2012 — when then-No. 1 Baylor bounced Florida in the second round — a tough road still lies ahead. 
Florida’s loss to Arkansas on Feb. 6 was 
not what it needed, with four of its last six 
games coming against ranked opponents. 
The Gators had an uncharacteristically stagnant offensive output against the Ra-
zorbacks, only mustering 49 points in a 55-49 loss in Fayetteville, Ark. 
They also turned the ball over an un-
precedented 25 times. 
“We did it to ourselves,” assistant coach 
David Lowery said of the loss. “I don’t think it was anything Arkansas did. If you 
look at the stat sheet, we turned the ball 
over 25 times. 
“We talk a lot about preventable plays, 
and those are preventable plays. Us tak-ing care of the ball and not making the bad Gators aiming for NCAA tourney berth with schedule waning

  After three consecutive 
weeks of reaching perfec-
tion, coach Rhonda Faehn 
thinks it may be time to give 
her two leading all-around gymnasts a break. 
  Faehn said Monday that 
she is considering resting Kytra Hunter and Bridget Sloan on at least one event during Florida’s (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) 
home meet against Arkansas 
(3-3, 1-3 SEC) on Friday. 
  “This Friday ... we may 
have that opportunity to 
have Bridget (Sloan) and Kytra (Hunter) maybe rest ﬂ  oor; we’ll have to see how 
training goes this week,” Faehn said. “If you ask them, they want to do everything 
all the time.” 
  Sloan and Hunter scored 
two consecutive 10s on ﬂ  oor 
during Florida’s ﬁ  rst home meet of the year against 
Georgia on Jan. 24. In Flori-
da’s most recent home meet against Oklahoma on Jan. 31, Hunter scored another 10 on 
ﬂ  oor. 
  Mackenzie Caquatto and 
Rachel Spicer got some rest 
in during Florida’s road win against Kentucky on Feb. 7. 
  Caquatto, who has com-peted all-around in three of 
UF past four meets, sat out 
on the ﬂ  oor and vault against Kentucky. Spicer competed in her usual vault (9.775) and 
balance beam (9.80) but not 
on ﬂ  oor. 
  “We’re using this oppor-
tunity to allow some athletes that are doing a lot of the leg 
work to freshen up a little 
bit,” Faehn said. 
  Besides Sloan’s individual 
success with a perfect 10 on 
beam, the Gators have had 
trouble perfecting an im-perfection that has plagued them since the start of the season: stuck landings. 
  “That was something in the ﬁ  rst four competitions that maybe we got some landings on one event but really not starting to dial in 
those stuck landings every-
where,” Faehn said. “This was the ﬁ  rst time I felt every-one got that landing.” 
  Faehn noted that four of 
the six Gators to compete on uneven bars stuck their land-ings — a vast improvement from past meets when Flor-
ida stuck no landings. 
  Florida achieved no sea-
son best in total event scores 
or overall scores against Kentucky, and individually, 
the Gators lacked some im-
provement. Besides Sloan, no Florida gymnast broke  a career- or season-best record 
against Kentucky in any 
event. Nonetheless, Faehn believes the Gators showed competitive improvements. 
  “It was such a great im-
provement to see that they competed aggressively and really started to kind of at-tack the event,” Faehn said. 
“That’s deﬁ  nitely what we 
were looking for at this point in the season.” 
  Now that Florida has of-
ﬁ  cially passed the halfway 
mark of the 10-meet regular 
season, Faehn said she is happy with where her squad is. 
  “I feel like they are not 
only conﬁ  dent and consistent 
and they’re competing ag-
gressively,” she said. “We’re really following the plan that we had set from the be-
ginning: start out a little bit 
slower … not pushing them right from the start.
  “These athletes really 
need to be fresh and feel al-
most like we just started sea-
son when it nears the end of the season.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2014

  LAYNE WEITZEL
 Alligator Writer @laynejweitzel 
  Heading into the second tournament 
of the spring season, Florida men’s golf 
coach Buddy Alexander is tempering his expectations for his young team.
  “Somebody asked me 
in August what my ex-pectations were this year, and I told them … that we 
would have plenty of diaper rash,” Alex-ander said. “I’ve got two freshmen that have played every tournament ... (I’ve) only had one senior play in the top ﬁ  ve in any event this year.”
  Although Florida boasts a talented ros-
ter, there are few veterans who have con-sistently played in tournaments this sea-son. It’s simple — the Gators are young.
  Two freshmen, Ryan Orr and Victor 
Tarnstrom, have competed in every tour-nament for Florida. In the four fall com-petitions, Orr shot an average of 74.92. Tarnstrom was not far behind, averaging 75.83 strokes.
  When asked about his decision to start 
two rookies in the Sea Best Invitational last week, Alexander simply stated Orr and Tarnstrom were among his best play-ers. But the pair struggled during the two-day competition, tying each other for 41st 
place with a shared score of 233 (+17).
  “We’ve had some growing pains,” Al-
exander said. “(We) haven’t quite turned 
the corner, haven’t quite grasped what we’re trying to get them to understand about how to play golf.”
  Still, the team’s youth has not dispelled 
his hopes. Alexander said he thinks that something will click for his players to help 
boost their conﬁ  dence and play.

‘What have we learned from 
the past and how can we uti-lize the past to help us get better?’”
Donovan is looking for 
the Gators to keep focused with a difficult stretch ap-proaching. 
Eight of Florida’s first 10 
SEC games were against op-ponents who are currently in the bottom half of the league standings. 
The Gators’ upcoming 
eight-game SEC slate fea-tures six contests against opponents in the top half — including two matchups 
against No. 14 Kentucky (18-
5, 8-2 SEC). 
Five of those games will 
be on the road.
“Now, with four of the 
next five on the road … and five of the next eight are on the road, it’s all going to even out,” Donovan said. 
“I’m not like overly joy-
ous and, ‘Great ‘cause we’re 10-0.’ I think it’ll all shake 
out after 18 games.”
No. 3 Florida’s first test 
during the eight-game stretch 
is a matchup at Tennessee (15-8, 6-4 SEC) tonight at 7.
The Gators cruised past 
the Volunteers 67-41 in the O’Connell Center on Jan. 25 and held them to a 26.8 percent shooting clip, but UF has not had that type of 
success in recent meetings in 
Knoxville, Tenn.
The Vols have won their 
past two home games against 
the Gators.
“It’s a tough place to 
play,” point guard Scottie 
Wilbekin said. 
“They have a great crowd 
up there. They play really well in their home court.”
A key for Florida will be 
stopping Tennessee big men 
Jarnell Stokes and Jeronne 
Maymon from dominating the paint.
“Once they’re close to the 
basket, they do a good job 
positioning and getting the 
ball,” forward Will Yeguete said. 
“So, we just got to make 
sure that we push him away.”
The Gators are also look-
ing to prevent guard Jordan McRae, Tennessee’s leading 
scorer with 19.3 points per 
game on 44.1 percent shoot-ing, from having a big scor-ing night in Thompson-Bol-ing Arena.
In both teams’ last match-
up in Gainesville, the Gators held McRae to only five points on 1-of-15 shooting. 
“Obviously he’s a great 
player and is capable of go-ing off for 30 points,” Wil-bekin said. 
“I know he’s going to 
come out looking to get 
something going in front of 
his own crowd.”
stay in Stillwater, Okla., for 
his second season after Or-
egon knocked his team out of the second round of the 2013 NCAA Tournament.
Donovan believes the 
heightened expectations sur-rounding Smart during his sophomore season have af-fected him mentally. 
He compared Smart’s sit-
uation to one a former player of his, Joakim Noah, experi-enced after deciding to wait 
on the NBA Draft and re-
main at Florida for his junior season following a national championship in 2006.
“Because he was a top-five 
pick a year ago, you feel like you have to play like a top-five pick. Whatever that looks 
like in his mind, what hap-
pens is you can never reach that level,” Donovan said. 
“Whether he thinks he 
has to score 30 points or have 
10 assists, five steals, it’s not 
going to happen. But you feel this unbelievable pres-sure and I saw it with Noah. 
When Noah came back after 
his sophomore year, the pres-sure he felt to perform every game was totally out of con-trol. Him, he made it out of 
control. 
“And I told Joakim this: 
‘You cannot allow people to 
rob you of your happiness 
playing the game.’ And I 
think in some ways, Marcus has allowed some happiness to be robbed from him a lit-tle bit in this whole process of coming back, not going, 
maybe not playing like they 
want to.
“I saw it with Joakim. 
Joakim hit the NCAA tour-nament as a sophomore like 
a lightning rod. We were 
unranked, everybody loved the kid, and then once the next year started, he was like 
completely a complete vil-
lain, like chest pumping and all that stuff. But he did that since he was a freshman.
“What happens is that 
gets very confusing for young guys, and Marcus is a young kid and he’s a com-petitor, and he wants to win 
and I think he’s one of those 
guys that just kind of keep on grinding. There’s no question his emotions got the best of him.”mistakes of just giving it to them, that’s what we did.”
“They scored 55 points, we 
scored 49 points. We played good defense, we just didn’t score the 
ball.”
What could have been a de-
moralizing loss turned into a 
springboard for Florida. 
“We got back Friday, we 
didn’t watch that film,” Low-ery said. “They knew what hap-pened. They knew what we did wrong.”
Against Kentucky on Sunday, 
the results mirrored those from Florida’s recent three-game win-ning streak. 
The Gators took care of the 
ball (16 turnovers), sank 9 of 20 threes and, most importantly, won the game.
The meeting after the loss to 
Arkansas served as a good pre-dictor for the win against Ken-tucky. 
January Miller was singled out 
in said meeting as being Florida’s X-factor. 
On Sunday against Kentucky, 
she scored a team-high 20 points, 
including a crucial three-point 
play that sparked a 14-0 run early in the second half. 
“In that meeting on Friday, we 
talked about January Miller being the X-factor,” Lowery said. 
“I thought she was the X-fac-
tor. We talk about plays that only Jan can make and plays that are 
unique that set January far from 
anybody else on the team.
“I think January, going in, had confidence. She had confidence that her teammates wanted her to do the things she knew that would make her stand out. I think 
she took pride in that and really 
showed that on Sunday.”

   The Gators did not see the im-
provement they hoped for the 
second day of the 2014 Northrop 
Grumman Tournament.
  Florida remains in 10th place 
after another round of 18 holes in 
Palos Verdes, Calif., shooting 302 
(+18) and bringing its total score to 
600 (+32).  The team is currently 33 strokes 
behind new leader Southern Cali-fornia, which ended Day 1 two 
strokes behind ﬁ  rst place.
  “The conditions 
were tough today,” 
coach Emily Glaser said in a release. 
“We hung in there pretty well at the beginning but had a stretch of holes through the middle of our round that killed us.”
  Junior Sarah Schober began the 
day tied for 16th place and tied for third place with Oklahoma’s Alex-andra Kaui with a total score of 140 (-3) at the end of Day 2. The junior, who is competing as an individu-
al, shot seven birdies and earned a 
second round score of 68 (-2).  
  “Sarah is having a great tour-
nament against a strong ﬁ  eld and we are very happy for her,” Glaser 
said. “She will play a key role for 
us the remainder of the spring.”
  Katie Mitchell led Florida’s 
lineup after the second round with 
a score of 72 (+1), improving by 
three strokes to reach 27th place. The redshirt sophomore shot ﬁ  ve birdies to lift her total score to 148 (+6).
  Senior Elcin Ulu also saw im-
provement after shooting 11 over par in the ﬁ  rst round, scoring three birdies and ending the day with a score of 75 (+4).
  The rest of the team struggled 
in Palos Verdes, with junior Ca-milla Hedberg dropping from sixth place to 29th after ﬁ  nish-ing the day seven-over and tying 
freshman Maria Torres. 
The two earned a total score 
of 149 (+7) and are currently tied with 10 other players.
  Freshman Karolina Vlckova 
added two more strokes to her Day 1 score and currently sits sixth 
from the bottom of the leaderboard with a total score of 160 (+10).
  Florida has one ﬁ  nal round to 
improve its standings against a 
lineup that includes eight of the 
top 10 Division 1 teams. 
  “This is a course that exposes 
your weaknesses,” Glaser said. “I 
think this team is learning a lot 
about what we need to do to get better.”   JORDAN MCPHERSON
 Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
   After eight freshmen joined the team last 
season, coach Becky Burleigh has only three 
new faces for the 2014 season.
  “We kind of made a conservative effort 
to make our team a little bit smaller,” she said. “But we think we have a lot of quality 
in this class, and we’re expecting big things from the three of them.”
  Two of Burleigh’s pickups — Los Gatos, 
Calif., native Jessie Holmes and Naperville, Ill., native Talise Romain — are both pro-jected to see playing time as defenders.
  Holmes, a hybrid defender/forward out 
of Los Gatos High, was a 2012-2013 All-
Santa Clara Valley Athletic League ﬁ  rst-
team selection and helped her high school capture the De Anza division of the SCVAL Championship in February 2013.
  “Jessie’s somebody who’s played an at-
tacking role on some of her teams,” Bur-leigh said. “But we’re looking at her mostly as a defender, which is the spot we’d like to have a little more depth in.”
  Romain, a four-star recruit according 
to TopDrawerSoccer.com, participated in a few of Florida’s camps in the past and caught Burleigh’s eye.  “She plays very similar to the way we 
play,” Burleigh said. “Her style of play and her ability to keep possession of the ball is important.”
  Cassie Owens, a forward from Louisville 
(Colo.) Monarch High, is a versatile player who Burleigh believes will make an imme-diate impact.
  “We think she can kind of play almost 
anywhere for us, besides goalkeeper,” Bur-leigh said. “She’s a forward by nature, and we expect that’s where she’ll start for us.”
  With such a small class of incoming 
players, Burleigh expects some of the un-derclassmen who had minimal playing time last season to have more opportuni-ties to contribute during Florida’s spring schedule. 
  The Gators’ offseason schedule, which 
starts with a home game against Tampa on Saturday, includes a match against the U-20 national team and contests against four teams that reached the quarterﬁ  nals of the 2013 NCAA Tournament.
  “They get a lot of opportunities to get a 
lot of reps and our spring schedule is ex-tremely aggressive,” Burleigh said. “So 
they’re going to get good reps against good 
competition and I’m pretty excited to see what that looks like.”
