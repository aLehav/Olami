After passing plans to request 
more than $100 million in federal 
earmarks and hiking dorm rent and parking decal prices Tuesday, UF’s Board of Trustees listened to impas-sioned pleas from UF’s graduate as-
sistant and faculty unions about low 
stipends and possible layoffs.
The three speakers said many of 
UF’s graduate assistants are not paid a living wage, though the university claims to want to shift to graduate education and research. They also claimed that UF could prevent lay-
offs by tapping hundreds of millions 
of dollars in unrestricted funds.
UF graduate student Regina 
Martin said UF has about $900 mil-lion it could use to soften the blow of budget cuts, but UF officials took issue with that claim.“I don’t know whether they’re 
naïve, or trying to mislead,” UF President Bernie Machen said, “when they suggest that that could be used to pay for some of the bud-get cuts.”
He said he welcomes an open 
discussion of UF’s budget after col-leges present their proposals with 10 
percent cuts in the next few weeks.
The $900 million figure Martin 
cited, which has also been cited by 
John Biro, president of the United Faculty of Florida, UF’s faculty union, is from a recent audit by Flor-

Bird seed, bread, trash bags on 
poles and bird traps have all failed to kick out the unwanted guests at Broward Dining Hall.Three house sparrows have 
taken up residence at the dining hall, perching on the metal ceiling rafters, chirping and sometimes flit-ting down to snatch crumbs of pizza 
crust and other goodies.
“It’s kind of gross if you think 
about it,” said Brent Moser, a civil engineering major who was eating 
at the center on Tuesday. “But it’s 
also kinda neat.”
About three weeks 
ago, Bill Hess, director 
of Gator Dining, which 
runs Broward Dining 
Hall,  became aware of the sparrow in the building, he said.
Over Spring Break, two more 
sparrows snuck in while the doors were open in the hopes that the first would fly out, he said.
From the sparrow’s perspective, 
the dining hall is a near perfect habi-tat.House sparrows can’t survive in 
the wilds of North America. Instead, they live off human establishments such as McDonald’s and Home De-pot, according to  Tom Webber, a

UF’s proposed cuts have started claiming victims.
The budget at the College of Journalism and Communi-
cations may be cut by 10 percent, according to college dean 
John Wright Jr. Wright, who spoke to a crowd of about 20 
students Tuesday in the Reitz Union Auditorium, answered questions about the cuts. 
Wright said he must prepare to make cuts of up to 10 per-
cent, about $909,000. The first series of cuts resulted in a trim 
of about 10.26 percent, about $1 million.
Most of the money was pulled from the 
expense funds of programs in the college, and some professors who left during that 
time were not replaced, he said.
Although Wright touted the fact that 
he made the first set of cuts without fir-
ing any faculty, he was not sure the same 
would be true this time.
“I have to be strategic about it,” he 
said. “My goal is to protect the fundamental core of our de-partment’s mission.”
Wright said despite the possible 10 percent cut, he hopes 
the state legislature will pass a bill increasing tuition by 15 percent a year for the next four years. If passed, the increase would put money towards replenishing programs and fill-ing open faculty positions, he said. 
Several students from the Documentary Institute, a 
program in the college’s telecommunications department, voiced their concerns after the program received a cut of $250,000 last fall. Wright said he understood their concerns but couldn’t guarantee the program would not be cut more.STATETrustees, graduate assistants debate pay

Woman slices two, self with box cutter
A Shands at AGH clerk was arrested Monday after she was 
accused of slicing two people with a box cutter and trafficking 
prescription drugs.
While on the porch of 618 S.W. Second Terrace, Nakishia 
Sullivan, 24, was approached by two women, one of whom she had an ongoing dispute with.
When the argument turned into a physical fight, Sullivan 
pulled a box cutter out of her purse and swung it at the women, according to the Gainesville Police Department arrest report.
Sullivan cut one of the women on her thigh and close to 
her vagina. Sullivan also sliced herself in the shin, according to the report.
When a man attempted to break up the fight, Sullivan sliced 
his arm, the report stated. 
Before she was taken to the police station, Sullivan gave of-
ficers a small bag of marijuana from her purse and the box cut-ter that was used in the fight, the report stated.
When officials searched her purse they found 15 Oxycodone 
pills, one Hydrocodone pill of and one ecstasy pill.
Sullivan was charged with five felonies including aggravat-
ed assault and trafficking Oxycodone and one misdemeanor of possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana.

Early voting for city elec-
tions began on Monday.
“We have not been absent,” 
Roth said, adding that efforts slowed because volunteers and students were gone during Spring Break.
Cavataro said 10 volunteers 
and 1,000 fliers are not suffi-cient and hoped Roth would 
increase efforts. 
Meanwhile, senators will 
postpone voting on a bill that 
suggested firing the two SG lobbyists, who are paid $55,000 a year. 
Federal affairs director Dann 
Somerstein read a letter on be-half of External Affairs Director 
Matthew Goldberger in sup-port of allowing the lobbyists to 
keep their jobs.
“There is not a substitute for 
individual and direct contact 
with our lobbyists,” he wrote. 
But Cavataro said the duties 
of the lobbyists were already ful-
filled by UF’s lobbyists and other student leaders. 
“It’s an unnecessary waste of 
money when our lobbyists don’t do that much,” he said.

SG debates lobbyists’ role
Tuesday night’s Student Sen-
ate meeting was filled with de-bate as senators voted to tighten their watch on one Student Gov-ernment organization and con-
sidered a bill that would remove 
SG’s lobbyists. 
The majority of senators 
passed the authorization, which ordered Chomp the Vote director Brett Roth to immediately fulfill his position’s duties and submit a written report of their fulfillment to Senate within 30 days. 
An authorization is an order 
from a Senate. 
“It tells him to do his job,” said 
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Ben Cavataro, who wrote the autho-rization. 
Chomp the Vote is UF’s Stu-
dent Government–funded voter registration organization and is 
responsible for efforts to bring 
students to the polls. 
Roth spoke to senators earlier 
in the meeting and said he was doing his job, citing efforts such as an e-mail that will be sent out through student organization list-

Walking past nitrogen tanks and stepping 
around carts stacked with latex gloves and beakers, it’s hard to imagine how Scherwin 
Henry has any time for anything but his re-
search.
But Henry, who spends part of his day 
hunched over a microscope listening to his iPod nano, said that above all, his goal is to serve the people of Gainesville.
The Gainesville native and UF biology 
researcher at the end of his first term as city commissioner for Gainesville’s District 1 said 
he decided to become a commissioner after years of local involvement when his children grew up and “no longer needed their daddy.”
One of Henry’s main concerns is respon-
sible expansion of business in Gainesville, 
which he said means creating a delicate bal-ance between development and conservation.
For this reason, Henry said he plans to vote 
“no” on Charter Amendment 2, which would require a state referendum vote to convert city-owned land used for conservation, recreation 
or cultural purposes to another use. 
Henry said that the proposed amendment 
has the potential to “close the door on prog-
ress.”
The other amendment on the ballot, Char-
ter Amendment 1, has Henry in a state of in-decision. He said that while he initially sup-
ported the anti-discrimination ordinance the 
amendment would remove, he now opposes 
the ordinance because he feels it is too far-reaching.
“I cannot support it 
comfortably in my heart,” he said. “To tell you the truth, I have not yet decid-ed how I’m going to vote.”
Henry said that in his 
second term, he also plans to focus on Gainesville’s 
youth.
“We’re in bad shape when it comes to pro-
viding opportunity for our children,” said Henry, who helped form the Gainesville Po-
lice Department’s Operation Respect Yourself, 
which taught conflict resolution to middle and high school students. “We just need to get our kids in a better environment.”
Henry is a registered Democrat, but he said 
that  he puts his constituents’ needs first.
“Partisan politics have no place at the local 
level,” said Henry.
 “When a citizen calls and says, ‘My lights 
are going to be cut off tomorrow and I don’t have the money. Can I have an extension?’ they could care less about how much eco-nomic development you’re bringing to their neighborhood,” he said. “They need you to help them keep their lights on.”LOCAL ELECTIONSCommission candidate focuses on local youth, economy

Those enjoying Krishna Lunch 
this week may have received some-thing extra with their meal — a flier. 
On Monday, meal servers began 
handing out the fliers, detailing the economy’s impact on meal costs.In the past two months, the 
amount of Krishna Lunch served increased 20 percent  from 2008, while donations are down about 15 percent, according to the flier. Stu-dents  are being encouraged to avoid waste, make a donation, discourage sharing plates and donate again for take-home meals.Krishna Temple president and 
meal server Carl Woodham, who is 
known as Kalakantha das, said the situation is not an ethical issue. 
“It’s financial,” 
Woodham said. “If we could, we would feed the world for free.”
Between 600 and 1,000 people every weekday eat the lunch and 
more than 50 percent of donations 
go toward food costs alone, Wood-ham said.  Krishna Lunch also has to pay servers, cleaners and cooks minimum wage. Right now, the lunch loses $400 a day, meaning about 100 people are sharing plates or not donating. If this trend continues, Krishna 
Lunch will resort to other strategies to make money, such as asking for a donation for each serving, handing out “seconds” coupons and elimi-nating discounts on lunch cards.
“We have a loving relationship 
with the students,” he said. “We cer-tainly don’t want to disappoint.”
Krishna Lunch serves more, nets fewer donations this year

UF Student Body President Kev-
in Reilly was behind enemy lines 
Tuesday to discuss proposed state budget reform and legislation with Gov. Charlie Crist.
Reilly was one of nine student 
body presidents who participated in the discussion in Tallahassee hosted by the governor as part of an ongo-
ing effort to get input from groups 
and organizations affected by Florida policy, according to a news release from the Governor’s Press Office.
Reilly said Crist began the half-
hour discussion with a short state-ment about his proposed $6-billion budget for higher education. 
He also discussed proposed leg-
islation that would allow boards of trustees to raise differential tuition 
by as much as 15 percent each year 
before taking questions from the presidents. 
Reilly said he did not have any 
questions for the governor, but re-quested that Crist oppose any addi-tional budget cuts. 
“That’s not something that’s 
good for the university or good for 
the state,” Reilly said. 
Reilly said he and the other presidents strongly support the dif-ferential tuition reforms because 
they would allow each university to set tuition based on its individual needs. 
Also, because student body pres-
idents have seats on boards of trust-ees, their input would be taken into account, he said. 
“All the student body presidents 
have a voice and a vote in that deci-sion,” he said. Reilly, who holds a seat on UF’s 
Board of Trustees, the university’s highest governing body, had to miss the second day of the board’s meet-ings to participate in the discussion. 
Reilly said he attended the first 
day of the board’s meetings, but he felt the opportunity to sit face-to-face with the governor was “too good to pass up.” 
“It was something that I weighed 
very carefully,” Reilly said.

Tuesday was a day of favor-
ites for Josh Stratton. 
“I’m 100 percent Irish,” he 
said between sips of his beer 
of choice — green Miller High Life.
Mother’s Pub & Grill, an 
Irish pub on West University Avenue,  was the only bar in town that had ordered the 
special beer, he said. The beer 
got its distinctive color at the brewery and flowed green from the tap.
Stratton, decked in a green 
baseball cap which read “Moth-er’s drinking team,” began his day in good Irish spirit by eat-
ing  soda bread, a traditional 
Irish bread which is made with baking soda in place of yeast.
He said St. Patrick’s Day 
is his favorite holiday, and he arrived at noon hungry for 
corned beef and cabbage.
It was an hour later before 
the $3 dish 
was ready, 
but he said  
it was worth the wait.
“I’m a happy camper,” he 
said, while scarfing down po-
tatoes, cabbage and beef.
Stratton goes to Mother’s 
regularly, and praised the bar 
over others in Gainesville.
“If everything goes as 
planned, I should be right here for the next 12 hours,” he said as the Irish band Flogging Molly played over the sound 
system.
As night fell, a line of about 
25 people stretched out the 
door, and people stood elbow

ida’s Auditor General. 
Although the money is listed as 
“unrestricted,” UF spokeswoman 
Janine Sikes said that term is mis-leading. The money is already allo-
cated for various uses and, further-
more, only about $80 million of that is held by UF. 
The rest is held by affiliated orga-
nizations such as Shands at UF and the University Athletic Association, which are not part of UF’s budget.
Of the $80 million in UF’s bud-
get, half is a reserve fund mandated 
by the state and the rest is money set 
aside by departments for supplies such as new computers or lab equip-ment, according to UF officials.
But the heads of UF’s faculty and 
graduate assistant unions don’t buy that argument.
“That is silly; it is disingenuous; 
and it’s phony,” Biro said.
He said even if it’s true that UF 
cannot use the full $900 million to prevent layoffs, he believes at least some of it should be available.
For example, he said if the $80 
million figure is more accurate, then, even taking into account the $40 mil-lion required to be set aside by state law, there is still another $40 million that UF doesn’t have to spend on equipment.
“You got a choice of what to 
spend it on,” he said. “They’re not 
denying that they’ve chosen to 
spend it on equipment rather than people.”
Regardless of where the money 
is located, Biro said it is clear UF has extra sources of revenue because it is hiring new faculty and staff.
According to its Web site, UF is 
currently advertising for 251 posi-
tions, 138 of which are for faculty.
“They have the money to do this, 
so how can it be that it’s unavoid-
able that faculty have to be laid off?” he asked. Layoffs, he said, should be a last resort.
In an interview last month, Ma-
chen said UF is doing most of its hir-ing with non-state money.
He said UF is hiring some new 
faculty members with money from federal grants, and some are hired from differential tuition money UF is required to use for new hires.
Other positions, like some in the College of Medicine, support them-selves through money collected by seeing patients, he said.
He also said UF is hiring at less 
than a third of its normal rate as a result of budget cuts.
Deeb Kitchen, 
co-president of UF’s Graduate Assistants United, who spoke at 
the meeting about graduate assistant pay, said it’s a matter of priorities.
If the problem is that UF’s assets 
cannot be spent on things such as better pay for graduate assistants be-cause of certain restrictions, he said, 
then maybe UF should think about 
changing the restrictions to allow for different uses of its money.
“Take a look at how it’s restrict-
ed, unrestricted,” he said.
He said even though UF is hiring 
new employees, giving them raises and was able to award Machen $285,000 in bonuses last year, many 
of UF’s graduate assistants do not 
even make a living wage.
He said the last time UF’s gradu-
ate assistants saw a pay raise was in 2006. Since then, the price of food, gas, rent and other necessities has gone up considerably, he said.
During contract negotiations this 
year, he said the graduate assistant union requested a raise of $1,000 but was rejected by UF. Since then, the union has offered to take a $400 one-time bonus, but UF has not accepted 
that offer either. Negotiations are 
currently at an impasse. UF officials declined to comment on specifics.
“We comprise half the instruc-
tional staff,” Kitchen said. “We do the most undesirable labor that’s required by research. Without ques-tion, we constitute the real founda-tion of The Gator Nation.”
Martin, the other graduate stu-
dent who spoke at the meeting, said almost 1,000 graduate assistants live below the federal poverty level.
And the average stipend, which 
she said is about $14,000 a year, is only about $1,200 more than UF’s cost-of-living estimate for in-state students, according to her calcula-
tions. As a result, she said many 
assistants have to take out loans to support themselves.
This shouldn’t have to happen, 
she said, because the combined load of taking classes and teaching is a full-time job, and UF should provide enough pay for all of its graduate assistants to live on while working and taking classes full-time.
UF Trustee Danny Ponce, how-
ever, expressed some concern with giving graduate assistants bigger 
stipends. He said he’s sympathetic 
to their plight but said some of the students don’t seem appreciative of UF’s recent creation of a health care plan for graduate students, which cost UF about $6 million.
“It seems like it’s a little unappre-
ciated by certain members of that group,” he said after the meeting.
Kitchen said he thinks graduate 
assistants shouldn’t have to feel ap-preciative.
“That was not something that 
was given to us (that) we should be appreciative for, that is something we had to force on them,” he said. Furthermore, he said he thinks UF is morally obligated to provide health 
care for its employees.
Ponce said he disagrees.
“Some people will look at it as a 
moral obligation, but that moral ob-ligation still cost this university $6 million,” he said.
UF spokeswoman Sikes said money listed as ‘unrestricted’ is misleading

Downturn extends beyond AIG, Madoff
In the wake of America’s 
economic downturn, one restaurant has bucked the 
current trend of slumping sales by employing a creative business model — name your own price.
For Sam Lippert, owner 
of the Java Street Cafe in Ket-tering, Ohio, business shot through the roof after giv-ing customers the ability to decide what they should pay for their meal.
According to an interview 
with CNN, Lippert said that the practice of naming your 
own price is common in Eu-
rope — something that he gives credit to his Bulgarian girlfriend for suggesting. 
Since customers are re-
quired to present payment to Lippert rather than simply leave money on the table, the restaurant has seen greater profitability rather than creeping deeper into the red.
“Well, you know, they 
have to look me in the eye and say that that’s what they think is fair,” said Lippert.
The Editorial Board thinks 
Lippert’s innovative idea should be modeled by more restaurants around the coun-try — especially considering the current uncertainty many individuals face with their fi-nances. 
What makes the system 
work is how customers can get away with paying less on days when funds are tight, 
but spend a bit more after re-
ceiving their paychecks.
Restaurants in Gainesville 
currently struggling to make ends meet should take a page from Lippert’s book and em-ploy a similar practice with hopes of satisfying the needs of both customer and propri-etor alike.Word out of New York reveals an ever-growing scan-dal behind the doors of beleaguered insurance giant AIG.
After subpoenaing the company on Monday, New York 
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo acquired information de-tailing how 73 AIG employees received bonuses of $1 million or more — 11 of which no longer work for the outfit. 
The next task for Cuomo falls on uncovering the names 
of the 11 former employees so that more details can be made known about when they left the company and how they re-ceived the outlandish bonuses.
Specifically, the former employees worked under the AIG 
Financial Products subsidiary, a sector of the company whose performance Cuomo described as having “led to crushing 
losses and the near failure of AIG” in his letter to the House 
Financial Services Committee. 
Additionally, Cuomo is trying to challenge the provisions 
in employees’ contracts that locked in 100 percent of 2007’s bonuses for 2008 — even when there were signs of economic turmoil to consider. 
What impresses the Editorial Board the most is the fast 
turnaround from Monday to Tuesday in which Cuomo was able to gather significant details addressing what exactly has been going on at AIG. 
Cuomo’s efforts in providing transparency for the general 
public with regard to the sheer mayhem surrounding AIG must be commended by President Barack Obama. 
As he suits up for a potential matchup in 2010 against Gov. 
David Paterson, Cuomo’s role as America’s watchdog will only serve to help him earn greater support from the masses.
As Americans fumble around in the dark in an at-
tempt to make sense of the economic mess we’ve found ourselves in, the country is searching for 
culprits so we can put our minds at ease. Those currently in the spotlight are none other than Ponzi schemer ex-traordinaire Bernard Lawrence Madoff and “those guys” over at AIG.
While AIG represents the irresponsibility and super-
fluous spending of the financial system, Madoff is the embodiment of unabashed greed and hubris. Blaming a handful of people won’t do us any good, but we need someone to indict — what better way than to make ex-
amples of these wrongdoers?
The difference between Bernie Madoff and AIG is their 
reaction to being caught: while Madoff pleaded guilty, 
AIG decided to ask for a handout. This doesn’t mean that 
Madoff’s move wasn’t calculated, and it does not relieve 
him from any of the blame. Even after admitting guilt, Ma-doff refuses to give the government dirt on anyone else involved.
There’s nothing I love more than hearing the very per-
son who swindled me out of my life savings give a mock-heartfelt mea culpa. If he sheds a tear or two, it’s just an added bonus, just because I love a good actor. 
Madoff’s “apology” was disingenuous, self-serving 
and ignorant and did nothing more than add fuel to the fire. The only thing he is truly sorry for is getting caught. I half expected him to mutter the words “and I would’ve gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for these meddling investigators!”
Good on you, Bernie. You’re still playing the role of vil-
lain we expect you to play. Claiming you did it by your-self? Brilliant, you 70-year-old menace!We are Americans, and if you 
hurt us, we will hurt you right back. We live for sure and swift 
judgment. It makes it easier for 
us to sleep at night knowing justice is being served — but if this is the case, why are people 
like many of the AIG executives 
still in the same positions they held before they basically drove 
the company into the ground?
Chances are that when AIG’s management does finally 
surrender and apologize to the American public, we’ll have our angry mobs gathered, armed and ready to shout at the top of our lungs that the apology just isn’t enough.
The outrage we feel is fleeting, and we’re a fickle bunch. 
Today we’re sharpening our pitchforks and readying the rack for the bigwigs at AIG and anybody in cahoots with Madoff. We can only guess who will be on the chopping block tomorrow.
Whoever it is, you’d better believe the people at MSN-
BC and FOX News will let us know, keeping us up-to-date on all things related to the failure of our economy. Turn your television to any of the 24-hour news networks and you’ll be blasted with constant updates on our failing 
economy — just in case you may have forgotten.
The issue is much bigger than Madoff, and it is even 
larger than the AIG notables. We can call shenanigans on 
many of the small players, but until we look at the big picture — and not just in minute-long segments scattered 
throughout the day — nothing will be fixed.

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, MARCH 18, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 7
They catch you as soon as you come in. 
The first thing seen by worshippers 
entering the United Pentecostal Church 
of Gainesville is the welcome center, manned 
by three women in long skirts and unassum-
ing button-ups — the remnants of some gen-
eration long gone, swept away in a sea of vio-lent video games, celebrity sex tapes, pederast priests and Scientology. My first impression was that my friend Corey and I were diving face-first into an antiquated past (but with snakes, because my Mom tried to tell me that Pentecostals were like a cross between “Deliv-erance” and “Indiana Jones and the Temple of 
Doom”).
Respectfully taking a seat in the back pew, 
I was still forced to confront this anachronism 
as the three women came upon me in one fell swoop. Pamphlets in hand, these women came to proselytize. 
After assuming that Corey and I were mar-
ried (most of the congregation, no matter how young, had spouses), and after we surprised 
them by saying we were UF students, the wel-
coming committee introduced us to a number of people, all of which, I’m sure, remember our names.
I met Charlie, a Santa Fe College sophomore 
who sometimes ran a Bible study for college students and was majoring in finance. I was under the impression that Charlie was not re-ally into being designated as a “leader” among 
any sort of “demographic,” but as soon as the 
church service started, I saw the Holy Spirit become alive in him. I should have known as soon as he said he was majoring in finance that the look of skepticism in his eyes was actually just a look of genuine confusion.
After meeting Charlie, scores of bright-
eyed Pentecostals came up to greet Corey and me. I was touched by about seven well-mean-
ing women who attempted to assimilate me 
into their maternal, Pentecostal order through neighborly affection. The only thing they had in common was their sincerity; I met people who were white, black, Hispanic, elderly and younger than me. Everyone I met was ear-nestly excited to see a newcomer and tried very hard to make a good impression. Also noticeable was the amount of interracial inter-action. I saw various white-colored Michelin Men say “I love you” to various men of color. The only time I ever saw this kind of interac-tion was in the Dave Matthews Band video for “Everyday” (where a nerdy white man hugs...
Tiki Barber?) and between Clay and his white 
adoptive parents on “South of Nowhere.” 
The service began vaguely with everyone 
standing and swaying to a hymn and its ac-companying PowerPoint. After this was over, Pastor J.W. Arnold called for a greeting peri-od, which, for Corey and I, had been going on for 30 minutes. 
After the greeting began the bible study. 
This is what I had heard about from various Pentecostals all evening. One woman told me that Arnold had been out for 13 weeks and that I should prepare for an “experience of a life-time.” Another man (who all evening rocked out with conveniently augmented devil horns on his hands) told me that this evening was all about “rock ‘n’ roll.”
While the preacher’s bible interpretation 
drove the service, the response of the laypeo-ple fueled the preacher. Cries of “Hallelujah!” and “Amen!” peppered the sermon, which lasted for a little more than an hour. Arnold boomed like Orson Welles over a “Mercury Program” radio broadcast, sweat gleaming on his brow and his veins bulging with conster-nation. In fact, Arnold’s preaching itself was almost about a “war of the worlds” in that he 
often personified God and the devil as two en-
emies contending for reign over our souls. 
Arnold stressed in his sermon three main 
ideas: the priesthood (and god-like potential) of all believers, the “oneness” of God, and the idea of God as a “person” one can run to for sanctuary in the times of earthly crisis. 
If the importance of the laity wasn’t stressed 
enough in the call-and-response shouting style 
of the sermon, Arnold made it a point to “call 
out” Catholicism for its belief in the church hi-erarchy and for its stoic prayer. 
The final tenet, the thematic centerpiece of 
the sermon, was on God being a person and a safe house for a believer in trouble. Arnold addressed his congregation like he knew their problems personally. He talked about the stress of “getting back your license” as he looked at one par-ticular man. He also spoke about issues that were associated with 
one specific, obvi-
ously predominat-ing, socioeconomic background. He blatantly (and eerily) acknowl-edged the domes-tic abuse going on 
in the many of the homes of the church mem-
bers and elicited responses from many of the 
women. 
He talked about the dollar being at an 
all-time low compared to the euro and the pound, and talked about those who were re-ally “squeezed” financially. I expected a litany of “they took our jobs!” to come next, but no dice. Basically, the sermon was tailored to the poor and struggling.
The content of the sermon made me think 
of African-American adaptations of Christian-ity that put the focus on Jesus as the ultimate sufferer who made all of the congregation’s problems light in comparison. Arnold used colloquialisms in his speech and in his bible readings, which called for people to lift their hands in praise, sing with their hearts and play musical instruments — all as according 
to selected passages that call for exuberant 
worship, especially drawing from the Psalms. This didn’t appeal to me because, personally, I like someone who can speak correctly. I don’t want to think that the “word of God” is “ain’t” or “doo-doo.”
As born-again Christians, Pentecostals 
place great weight on repentance. Arnold con-tinually made references to “past mistakes” 
and the need to overcome them to live “in the 
now” and “for God.” Like Catholicism, the Pentecostals think that believing must be sup-plemented with good acts, rejecting the tradi-tional Protestant notion of “salvation by faith alone.” Pastor Arnold said, “Every day above the ground is a good day.” The difference between Pentecostals and other Christians is their emphasis on the Holy Ghost. The pastor brought up speaking in tongues, but that nev-er actually occurred. According to Corinthi-ans, “everyone…hath a tongue” and therefore must use it to praise the Lord. Pentecostals do not consider speaking in tongues to be an “op-
tional gift,” but something that everyone will 
perform if cajoled correctly. I was also expect-ing to see the ritual of snake handling; unfor-tunately, I was unable to experience it. ”
So what does it all add up to? The call-
and-response, the cry to live in the present, the speaking in tongues, the playing of instru-ments, the worship in dance and the commu-nity so close-knit it can smell newcomers from 
a mile away? Gratification. Pentecostals cer-
tainly put an emphasis on overcoming hard-ship. 
Their spritual-esque songs, to the focus on 
movement and the idea of using God as a ref-uge are all similar to ways in which African-Americans used Christianity to overcome the emotional weight of slavery. Instead of treat-ing the service like a solemn, esoteric ceremo-
ny, they treated it like a party where everyone 
was invited. 
While the Pentecostals focus on words like 
love, mercy, compassion and renewal, the majority of their rituals celebrate earthly life and fun (as long as the fun involves worship-ping God).  Seeing the Pentecostals worship showed me just how adaptive the religion can be to certain niches. 
In this case, those who are generally poor 
and uneducated and believe in a strong fel-lowship and church community to supplant the lack of congruency they feel with modern society, and those who like to bring together elements of African-American tradition, expe-rience-based worship and restorationist zeal for one hell of a sermon. 
Attending one church service might have 
no effect on the weight of my soul, but at least it has informed me of one fact: Christianity will not die anytime soon. 
Like a cockroach, it can survive in any con-
dition or circumstance and evolve into what-ever it needs to in order to survive in various splinters of our culture.

Pentecostal church service proves adaptive to community

“It’s a really adaptable bird as long as it’s in 
the company of people,” Webber said.
But Hess isn’t concerned with where they 
came from; he just wants them gone.
He spent Spring Break trying to remove 
them by every method he could come up with, 
he said.
Using seed and bread to entice the sparrows 
to the door, trying to corral them with trash bags taped to poles and setting cage traps have all proved futile.
Hess consulted the window installation 
company to see if glass could be removed tem-
porarily from higher spots in the building to let 
the sparrows out, but the venture would cost too much, he said.
Hess said that he has to weigh the time pres-
sure with the birds’ lives. He doesn’t want to kill them, but he is running out of options.
About two weeks ago a complaint was filed 
about the first sparrow, said Anthony Dennis, the environmental health director of the Ala-
chua County Health Department.
An inspector visited, saw that there was a 
bird in the building and issued a citation. Mul-
tiple citations on the same issue can result in serious consequences.
The Alachua County Health Department 
plans to do a follow-up visit within the next couple of days.
“If we see a sanitary nuisance issue then 
we’ll close the kitchen,” he said. “They know that.”Birds may close

THE AssOCiATEd PrEss
WASHINGTON — The Obama 
administration will endorse a U.N. 
declaration calling for the world-
wide decriminalization of homosex-uality that then-President George W. Bush had refused to sign, The 
Associated Press has learned.
U.S. officials said Tuesday 
they had notified the declaration’s 
French sponsors that the adminis-tration wants to be added as a sup-
porter. The Bush administration 
was criticized in December when it was the only western government 
that refused to sign on.
The move was made after an 
interagency re-
view of the Bush administration’s 
position on the 
nonbinding document, which was signed by all 27 European Union members as well as Japan, Austra-
lia, Mexico and three dozen other 
countries, the officials said.
The officials spoke on condition 
of anonymity because Congress was 
still being notified of the decision. 
They said the administration had decided to sign the declaration to 
demonstrate that the United States 
supports human rights for all.
“The United States is an out-
spoken defender of human rights and critic of human rights abuses 
around the world,” said one offi-
cial.Sources: Obama to sign UN gay rights declaration

At the intersection of Marion and Thom-
as S. Boyland streets in Brooklyn, N.Y., is the 
Marion Hopkinson Playground.  
Circled by a black chain-link fence and 
surrounded by the city skyline, the court is stereotypical New York. 
Pickup games run on the green-and-
white asphalt from sun up to sundown.
Girlfriends and mothers sit on the park’s 
wooden benches and watch while children 
too young to know any better shout profani-
ties at each other and argue over fouls.
On the playground, no matter how old, 
every day is a chance to build a reputation.
For the kids who play there, it’s an op-
portunity to maybe one day go to college. To 
maybe make it out of the circumstances they 
were born into.
For others, it’s an escape. A chance to re-
live the glory the game once gave them.
To those who play there, Marion Hopkin-
son is the center of the basketball universe.
For Erving Walker, who grew up across 
the street in a two-bedroom apartment with 
his parents, Robert and Kim, it was nothing more than a distraction — just another pit-
fall that could have derailed his dream.
Walker never spent much time on that 
court. He never sat on those street corners. There was always too much to lose.
Instead, Walker’s talent took him to the 
air-conditioned gyms and Catholic prep schools most of the kids on the playground 
would never see.
Brooklyn Boy
Walker and his parents lived in Brook-
lyn’s Atlantic Towers section when he was 
a baby. 
But Robert and Kim soon moved their 
son to the city’s Brownsville neighborhood in search of a bigger space.
By age 3, Walker began following Robert to the pickup basketball games he played on 
Saturday and Sunday.
“Me and my dad have always been close, 
but basketball has definitely made us a lot closer,” Walker said. “I always wanted to play with him — sometimes when I was too 
young for it.”
Walker would watch Robert from the 
sidelines, basketball in hand. Before he was 4, Walker could shoot a full-size ball. 
After each one of Robert’s games, Walker 
would try shooting from a little bit farther from the basket than he did before.
By age 5, he could shoot the three. 
“Like any little kid, he used to love to 
play with the ball,” Robert said. “He’s been playing ever since. It’s been the biggest part of his life.”
Walker soon began to play organized ball 
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood youth programs.
“You couldn’t play until you were 7. He 
was 5, but he was good enough, so they let him play,” Robert said. “Not only was he 
good enough, but he was the best player on 
the team and one of the best in the league. That’s when I knew he was going to be pret-
ty good.”
He quickly developed a penchant for 
making big shots.
“I was playing in a CYL (Catholic Youth 
League) ... when I was 7,” Walker said. “My 
dad was the coach, and it was a 9-and-under 
league. We were down 3, and I hit a three 
to send it into overtime,” Walker said. “I’ve just always been confident in those situa-
tions.”
By fifth grade, the year his team won the 
Amateur Athletic Union national champion-ship, Walker started to garner attention by 
local scouts.
He was 4-feet-8-inches tall.
By age 11, Walker’s basketball skills were 
good enough for him to play against kids al-
most twice his age.
Robert recalls Walker’s cousins would take him to find older kids or even adults who were willing to bet Walker couldn’t keep up.
Most of the time, it was a risky proposi-
tion.
“Because he was so small, the big kids 
thought they could gorilla him,” Robert said. “He got used to getting banged around a little bit.”
By seventh grade, Walker had practically 
become a basketball prodigy, mentioned in the same breath as Stephon Marbury and

UF guard Erving Walker drives with the ball during the second half of the Gators’ 82-
68 win against Vanderbilt on Feb. 21 in the O’Connell Center.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
The UF basketball team sat and watched the NCAA 
Tournament selection show Sunday just like all the oth-
ers.
But even they knew any chance of seeing orange and 
blue light up the screen was a long shot.
“We definitely watched it, but we figured our name wasn’t going to be called,” sophomore guard Nick Cal-athes said. “Obviously, in our mind, we knew we didn’t 
get enough wins to get in.”
Instead, the Gators will play in the 
NIT.
UF (23-10, 9-7 Southeastern Confer-
ence) earned one of the tournament’s four No. 1 seeds and will play the first 
three rounds at home.
“It’s tough,” Calathes said. “One of your goals at the beginning of the season is to win the NCAA Tourna-
ment.”
The Gators made it to Madison Square Garden and the 
semifinals of last season’s NIT before losing to Massachu-
setts.
UF will open the NIT against Jacksonville (18-13) to-
night at 8 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.

Sebastian Telfair — players con-
sidered to be hoops royalty in the city.
The only thing holding him 
back seemed to be his height. At the time, Walker was still shy of 5 
feet.
His parents and scouts weren’t 
too concerned. Robert is 6 feet tall. Kim, a former Brooklyn track star, 
is 5-foot-6. Everyone assumed a growth spurt was still coming.
“It’s funny, we try not to talk 
about it,” Robert said. “In the Walker household, we’ve always 
hoped for a little growth spurt. 
One year he grew two or three inches. We thought that might be 
it, but it just never came.”
Walker is now listed at 5-foot-
8.
High school scouts became 
something of a fixture in Walker’s 
life.
“They try a little bit of every-
thing,” Walker said. “They call you. They always try to be around.”
Walker’s talent gave him oppor-
tunities. But for Robert and Kim, it became hard to distinguish those 
who could help their son achieve 
his dreams from those who want-ed to exploit him.
“There were people that tried, 
but we shaded that away, and it became kind of known that wher-
ever he was at, we were at,” Robert 
said. “We were careful. I was at 99 percent of his games and practices. We were always there, and we al-
ways protected him from all of that 
stuff. The ones that tried realized it was almost pointless.”
Walker and his family even-
tually decided the best fit for the developing guard was Christ the 
King Regional High School in 
Queens, N.Y.Walker first met former Christ 
the King basketball coach Bob Oli-va in the third grade when Walker 
attended the school’s summer 
camp.
In Oliva’s 27 years at the school, 
he coached Lamar Odom, Speedy Claxton, Jayson Williams, Omar Cook, Eric Barkley and Khalid 
Reeves — all future NBA players.
If Walker wanted to get to the 
next level, Christ the King was the place for him.
Walking Tall
By 16, Walker was taking a 
ferry to Staten Island three times a week to work out with trainer 
Jerry Powell, known as one of the city’s best.
The Town Hall annex at Baby-
lon, N.Y., was air-conditioned — except for the gym where Powell 
held daily workouts.
Big men dominated the court. 
There was United States Basket-ball League star Garnett Thomp-
son. DePaul’s Cliff Clinkscales and Fairleigh Dickinson’s Cameron 
Tyler battled one-on-one almost 
daily.
There was even a slew of Su-
danese high school players look-ing for a chance to get noticed by American colleges.
Walker was the youngest play-
er at the workouts, and, at 5-foot-6, he was also the smallest.
“Maybe I’ll grow 5 inches taller 
and we’ll see,” Walker said. “Ev-erybody wants to be a little taller, 
but I don’t just sit there and wait 
for it. I play the cards I was dealt.”
By the end of his senior year at 
Christ the King, Walker had led the school to a city championship and cemented his place as one of New 
York’s best high school players.
After a heavy recruitment, 
Walker committed to play at UF for Billy Donovan.“I was concerned as a coach 
recruiting a guy that small. I re-ally was,” Donovan said. “The first 
time I met him, I hadn’t watched him play. I was like, ‘Oh my gosh. 
My 7-year-old daughter could post 
him up. What am I doing here?’”
But Oliva, Donovan’s child-
hood CYL coach, insisted there was more to Walker than most were willing to see.
“Bobby kept telling me, ‘There’s 
something about him,’” Dono-van said. “He’s got a great belief 
in himself. He’s not afraid to take 
big shots. Some guys have surface confidence; they act like they’re 
confident. Erving has a really deep 
internal confidence.”
Soon after Walker’s commit-
ment, the Gators signed McDon-
ald’s All-American point guard Jai 
Lucas, a move that became neces-sary after the early departure of 
Taurean Green to the NBA.
Donovan worried the move 
might cause Walker to shy away from Gainesville.
“I told him, ‘If you really feel 
like you need to reopen your re-cruitment and make a decision that 
is best for you, then I will under-stand,’” Donovan said. “He said, 
‘No, coach. Whenever I play, I will 
have to compete, and I have no problem going in there and com-
peting, and this is where I want to go.’ I really respected and admired 
that because I think that shows a 
lot in a player.”
Maybe it’s the Brooklyn in 
Walker, but the 5-foot-8 point guard didn’t blink.
“I was in kind of a similar posi-
tion in high school. When I was in eighth grade, Christ the King had 
a guy, Malik Boothe — he goes to St. John’s now — in a worst-case 
scenario,” Walker said. “I figured 
that we could just play together at some point. I just wanted to battle. 
I’m not going to back down from a 
challenge.”
Soon after his arrival in 
Gainesville, Lucas opted to trans-fer to Texas. As for Walker, he has become the Gators go-to reserve 
this season, averaging 10 points 
per game and easing any concern Donovan once had about the point 
guard’s size.
Disproving Doubters
As much as he has tried, Walker 
has never been able to escape the criticism. From the time he was in 
youth league, skeptics have looked for reasons why he wouldn’t make 
it — his ability is always in ques-
tion because of his height.
The doubters said he would 
never crack the varsity team at Christ the King. 
Then they argued he would 
never be more than a role player. And surely even as good as the high school star was, major college 
ball was just a dream.
But Walker has never fit into the 
mold others have cast for him.
In the summer of 2007, when 
some of the nation’s top high 
school talent was brought to Har-
lem’s Rucker Park for the Elite 24 
showcase game, Walker was left off the main roster.
Instead, he was one of the two 
or three fill-ins — a local replace-ment for some of the big-name no-
shows.
He was almost lost in the crowd 
at 155th Street. The fact that he was the smallest player on the 
court wasn’t. Walker opened the game by missing a layup. On the 
next possession he got his shot 
blocked.
Unwilling to allow the doubters 
the satisfaction of his misfortune, Walker fought back, knocking down several threes and leaving 
his mark on the game.
“I love when somebody looks 
down on me or thinks it’ll be easy,” he said. “If they lose some of their 
edge, that just makes it easier for me. And why not have it easier?”
Even now that the sirens and 
screams of the city have been re-placed by the calm of a small col-
lege town, Walker finds himself at 
the butt of jokes.
“When I first met him, I thought 
he was the new manager,” Chan-dler Parsons said.
Even senior Walter Hodge ad-
mits to taking a few cheap shots at the freshman’s expense.
“Every time we joke with him, 
he never gets sensitive or anything like that,” Hodge said.
And why would he?
When it comes to ridicule, 
Walker’s been through worse.
The jokes linger, but it’s the 
sound of the silence that has been 
the hardest adjustment for a kid used to the city’s constant motion.
“It’s a much slower life,” Walk-
er said. “New York is fast-paced. Things close much earlier down 
here. There’s an adjustment.”
But just like a boy from Brook-
lyn, the sound of a bouncing ball and squeaking rubber soles never 
changes — whether it’s under the street lights of Marion Hopkinson 
Playground or the bright lights of 
the O’Connell Center.UF freshman guard goes from overlooked to immediate contributor

they act like they’re con -

lantic Sun Conference regular-season title after going 
through an out-of-conference schedule that included FSU, Ohio State and Georgetown.
“We’re still playing a basketball game,” Calathes said. 
“If you look at the NIT, there are really good teams who didn’t get in. It will be a good opportunity to finish the year out the way we want to.”
UF suffered yet another late-season collapse, losing seven of its last 12 games.
“Coming down the stretch, if you look at our games, we 
played Mississippi State, we played LSU and we played Tennessee,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Those are all the 
teams that are in the tournament and really, to be honest 
with you, teams that were better than us.
“I think we need to get physically tougher, and I think 
we really need to get a whole lot mentally tougher.”CHANEY OUT FOR NIT: Donovan said Tuesday that fresh-
man forward Allan Chaney is likely done for the year.
“He’s got a ligament problem that’s kind of attached to 
the bone (in his foot),” Donovan said.
“I wouldn’t anticipate him playing the rest of the 
year.”Freshman forward Chaney to miss Jacksonville game, rest of postseason

FSU’s Tyler Holt yelled back at Buddy Mu-
nroe after running over UF’s catcher to score 
the game-tying run in the top of the ninth. Mu-nroe responded with his bat.
Munroe lined a single into right-center field 
to score Matt den Dekker to secure a 5-4 win for the Gators (10-7, 0-3 Southeastern Confer-ence) in walk-off fashion on Tuesday night at McKethan Stadium.
“It was nice for it to come down to me, and for me to deliver,” Munroe said.
Hitting a walk-off isn’t all fun and games, 
though. Munroe caught a 
left hook from teammate Avery Barnes amid the cel-ebration that left him with 
a bloody lip. Not even the 
fat lip could take the smile off his face after hitting his first college walk-off.
His late-game hit  wasn’t 
his only contribution to the 
win, as he also had two hits and an RBI.
“Each at-bat is each at-bat, but (the two hits) gave me good confidence coming in there knowing I already hit the ball well today,” he said.
He also kept busy behind the plate, han-
dling seven UF pitchers and diving to tag a runner at the plate to end the fourth.
“I know the staff well, and I have confi-
dence in them all,” Munroe said. “It’s always fun to see a lot of arms out there, especially the younger guys, who haven’t gotten many innings, and I like to see who steps in certain times and see what they can do.”
Usually the use of seven different pitchers 
indicates a struggling staff, but the Gators held a Seminoles team that entered the game aver-aging more than 8 runs per game to just 4.  
After Clint Franklin gave up 2 runs in the 
sixth in relief of starter Alex Panteliodis, UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan later handed the ball to freshman Greg Larson.
The newcomer looked like a veteran, forc-
ing Ohmed Danesh to ground into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded.
“There were a lot of positives (out of the 
bullpen),” O’Sullivan said. “I don’t want any-thing negative to creep into their minds.”

It was the best news the UF 
women’s basketball players had heard in three years, and 
they were wishing for something better.
They were sulking for a  reason. 
They should’ve been upset. The Gators thought they deserved a higher seed, and they were right.
After going 23-7 overall and 9-5 
in the Southeastern Conference — the toughest league in the nation — you’d think the Gators deserved better than a No. 8 seed and a po-tential second-round tango with undefeated Connecticut.
This is where this program is 
now: They can complain after ac-tually making the NCAA Tourna-ment. Last year, they would’ve been sprinting onto University Av-enue had they even been selected into the field of 64, and two years ago they were one of the laughing-stocks of Division I-A.
“It speaks 
a lot to how far this pro-gram has come in a very short amount of time,” UF coach Aman-da Butler said.
In Tuesday’s second-round 
game, the Gators will be beaten down, thumped and any other word you can think of against the Huskies, who have defeated teams by an average of 31 points. UF won’t have a problem with 
Temple, its first-round opponent, but it will be sad to see the college careers of Marshae Doston and Sha Brooks end in a debacle against Connecticut. 
Even though that’s not what 
this team deserves, who cares? The fact that they are even in this situa-tion is rather absurd. 
I watched and covered nearly 
every game this team played two years ago when it stumbled to a 9-22 record. Program respectabil-ity seemed about five years away. That’s when Butler came in and in-stilled competitiveness in practice and signed players who actually made their practices competitive. 
“During spring break, all we’ve 
been doing is beating each other up in practice,” Brooks said.
Everyone else has taken notice 
of UF’s rise — at least those not on the tournament selection commit-tee. 
The Gators are no longer a team 
opponents giggle about when they look at their schedule. Now, it’s more like, “Oh, boy, do you think we really practiced our man-to-man defense enough? Let’s go take a few more jumpers, too.”
These past 30 games have 
shown UF is one of the fastest-ris-ing programs in the country. 
Recruits are noticing, and the 
top women’s basketball players in Florida no longer think FSU is the closest competitive program in their state.
One year in the NCAA Tourna-ment does not make a program, this is true. I highly doubt any-one, however, would say Butler is building a program that can’t make the tournament every year. 
Finally, UF has the makings of a 
consistent program. There’s not the sporadic recruiting that happened under Carolyn Peck. You can tell there’s actually a plan now. 
The plan is working and could 
continue to work for some time now. It won’t be a plan that is fully executed next week unless a ridicu-lous upset happens, but there’s still little room for disappointment.
So when Butler and her under-
classmen are depressed after get-ting throttled against the Huskies, they need to remember just one thing: This is just the start.
