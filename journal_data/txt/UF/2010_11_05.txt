University Police are investigating a 
report of indecent exposure at Diamond 
Village that occurred Wednesday night. 
According to a report on the UPD 
website, a student reported seeing a na-ked man walking through Diamond Vil-lage at about 7:30 p.m.
The student told police the man — 
described as white with black hair, about 5-foot-3 and between the ages of 25 and 30 — said, “Hello,” when she approached him.  A suspect has been identified in the case, but UPD is still investigating the in-cident, according to the report. 
Anyone with information on the in-
cident should contact the UF Police De-partment’s Criminal Investigations Divi-sion at 352-292-4705.

� MARKET STREET PUB WAS 
OPEN FOR 20 YEARS.

Cleaning up vomit out of urinals 
and scrubbing blood off the floor is 
hopefully over for Danny Hughes, 
a former manager at a local bar. Hughes and his fiancee, Joy John-ston, plan on providing a “more ma-ture” bar experience downtown.
The couple held their grand open-
ing of Loosey’s, at 120 SW First Ave., on Thursday night in the building that was formerly home to Market 
Street Pub for more than 20 years. 
Due to financial problems, the 
pub was forced to close in August.
When the property’s real estate 
became available, Hughes and John-ston were hesitant on signing the 
lease but finally made it official on Oct. 11.
Hughes felt that his plans for the 
bar were drastically different from what Market Street used to be, and he decided to change the establish-ments name to Loosey’s after his dog, a loveable brown Floridian 
mutt. 
The bar opened early last week-
end to cater to people in town for 
Gainesville’s punk-rock festival the 
Fest 9.  Hughes said it was worth 
the stress, considering the bar made about $4,200 in sales, covering a majority of their first month’s rent, which is $4,800.
According to Hughes, his new 
rock ‘n’ roll bar will cater to grad stu-dents and those looking for a more relaxing atmosphere.
“I was a general manager at Gator 
City for 10 years, and I loved the midtown area, but if I didn’t work there, I probably wouldn’t be in there,” Hughes said. “This bar we’re 
opening is a big-people place.”
Rachael Bruce, 22, said she en-
joyed Market Street’s atmosphere, 
but after hearing a promotion for 
free beer by 100.5 The Buzz, she 
decided to see if the new bar was worth her time.

Along with cooler temperatures, art 
and music will be abundant this weekend 
in downtown Gainesville.
The 29th Annual Downtown Festival 
and Art Show will be held downtown from the Hippodrome State Theatre to 
City Hall. 
The event kicks off at 7 p.m. today with 
a free blues concert on Bo Diddley Com-
munity Plaza. The art show will open Saturday at 10 a.m. and continue through Sunday.
“We have a community that totally 
supports the arts,” said Linda Piper, events coordinator for the festival. 
The festival is organized by the City of 
Gainesville Department of Parks, Recre-ation and Cultural Affairs. 
Piper said the weather forecast will be 
“absolutely perfect” for the festival; tem-peratures are expected to drop this week-
end. 
The show includes 250 artists in addi-
tion to performers at three different stages. 
It is expected to attract 100,000 visitors, about half of which usually come from out 
of town, according to entertainment coordi-
nator Bill Hutchinson.
The art show was 
one of the top 30 festi-
vals in the country last year, according to 
Sunshine Artist Magazine.
The performers range from the Lost 
Safari Drummers, an ensemble that plays Art festival starts tonightUF ADMINISTRATION

The Board of Governors approved a 
regulation change Thursday that will al-
low Florida’s public universities to submit 
proposals to institute block tuition — some-thing UF administrators hope to do over the next few months.
With block tuition, the university would 
charge a flat rate for full-time students, re-gardless of the number of credits taken.
For example, under one version of the 
system, the rate could be set at the cost of 
15 credit hours, and students would be 
charged that rate if they take anywhere be-tween 12 and 18 credit hours.
At the second and final day of meetings 
in Emerson Alumni Hall, the board opened up a procedural path for state universities to make a move to block tuition through a 
series of proposals and approvals by higher 
governing bodies.
UF is the only university in the state that 
has expressed a desire to pursue block tuition. 
UF Provost Joe Glover 
said he will present dif-ferent block tuition mod-
els to UF President Bernie 
Machen, who will direct 
the drafting of a precise proposal.
The final proposal 
will go before UF’s Board of Trustees dur -
ing their December meeting. 
If approved, the proposal would then 
be submitted to the Board of Governors in January.Board makes next step

� THE PARTICIPANTS WILL PLAY 
WITH 600 DODGEBALLS.

and TAYLOR DIXON
Alligator Contributing Writers
This weekend, dodgeball is not just a game 
for  children during recess — it’s a chance for 
UF students to become a part of “The Guin-
ness Book of World Records.” 
The Inter-Residence Hall Association will host what it hopes will be the world’s larg-est dodgeball fight on Sunday at Flavet Field. 
The event is free and open to students, faculty 
and staff. The group hopes to get about 2,000 participants, said Sean Johnson, president of IRHA. 
The University of California, Irvine cur -
rently holds the record with 1,745 partici-pants, said Adam Lindsley, the event’s co-director. 
Check-in for the competition begins at 3 
p.m. and participants must bring their Gator 1 Cards.When players arrive, they will be assigned 
to a team, either orange or blue, and will not 
be allowed to leave until the game is over. 
This rule will help ensure that IRHA breaks the record. 
The event will cost IRHA 
$2,600, which has come from several area businesses, Linds-ley said.
The 600 dodgeballs used in the fight will 
go on sale for $5 after the event, and all pro-
ceeds will be donated to the Boys & Girls 
Club of Alachua County, he said. About 150 balls will be given to the children to use after school. 
In 2008, the organization attempted to 
break the world record for the largest water balloon fight but failed. The event attracted about 600 people, 300 participants short of 
breaking the record.
But IRHA members have been working 
hard during the past seven months to reach 
their goal this time.
“We’re really, really close,” Lindsley said. 
“So close that every single person that comes makes the difference.”Students hope dodgeball game will be world’s largest

The university’s commitment to 
diversity will be in the spotlight Fri-
day as the 2010 Black Male Summit will take place Friday at 5:30 p.m. in Pugh Hall. 
The event is hosted by the Insti-
tute of Black Culture and the Multi-cultural and Diversity Affairs office. Sponsors include Accent Speakers Bureau, the Black Student Union and Student Government.
The half-day summit will ex-
plore the challenges that black males face at UF.  Participants will 
discuss why these challenges occur 
and what the university can do to remove barriers that hinder black men from achieving success.
“I think the Black Male Summit 
is important because of the nega-tive portrayal of black men in the media,” said Demetri Morgan, the coordinator of the summit. “The 
goal of the event is to create an en-
vironment for people to increase their understanding of what black males experience at UF.”
The summit will feature a key-
note address by Shaun Harper, a student affairs expert from the Uni-versity of Pennsylvania. 
Dominique Martin, a political 
science junior, said he often has to dispel stereotypes many people may have about how a black male behaves.
“It’s a burden and a blessing, I 
have to represent the entire race,” he said. “That responsibility serves as my motivation to always do my best no matter what.”Summit to address

This Sunday, a UF student organization 
will be taking steps to help the less fortunate 
as it hosts its first 5k, Run for the World.
Heal the World, a service organization 
dedicated to helping others in need by facili-tating service projects in the community and the state, is holding the event at Flavet Field with check-in starting at 8:30 a.m. and the race beginning at 9 a.m.
The race will be held to benefit Soles4Souls, 
a shoe charity that has donated millions of pairs of shoes to adults and children in need. 
Registration is currently $15, and every do-
nated dollar going toward purchasing a new 
pair of shoes for someone in need. The event is open to the public.
Trophies, ribbons and gift cer -
tificates will be awarded to those 
who finish first, but every participant will be entered for a chance to win raffle prizes. Ad-ditional raffle tickets will cost extra.
Mero Geesey, Heal the World vice presi-
dent, said he hopes the cause is reason enough to get students to participate in the race.
“Even if 50 people sign up for the 5k, that 
means $500. That means 500 shoes,” Geesey said. “I think that’s really incredible.”
Geesey, an avid runner, said he hopes to 
encourage those who have never participated in a 5k before to get involved. 
“It’s a mental thing,” he said. “When it gets 
tough, you just have to tell yourself, ‘I’m run-ning this for a cause and, because I’m running, 10 people will have shoes who didn’t have them before.’” Max Reed / Alligator Staff

For one night, Broward Hall was 
turned into a home for hatred and op-
pression. But at the end, the hosts had the answers.
Last night, the Inter-Residence Hall 
Association  divided the hall into six 
“hate rooms” for the Tunnel of Oppres-
sion: immigration, religion, evolution of slavery, genocide, sexual orientation and self-image. 
“The goal of the Tunnel of Oppres-
sion is to evaluate present causes of oppression and to give help to people who are seeking it,” said freshman his-
tory and English major Kathleen Pait. 
“We want to break down the barriers between those who suffer oppression daily and those who don’t experience it at all.”
Broward Recreation Room opened 
with a “wall of oppression,” where stu-dents were invited to describe a time when they had faced oppression and 
then tape an index card to the back wall 
of the room. Students were then taken in groups to the individual hate rooms.
The tunnel opened with the immi-
gration room and narrowed to more personal topics, eventually ending with rooms addressing sexual orientation 
and self-image.
“I wanted to do something that 
would really hit people close to their 
hearts,” said junior health science major 
James Suridis, who planned the sexual orientation room, including the photo-
graphs, actors and scripts.
“I hope that the students will take 
out the importance of preventing op-pression,” he said.  “It’s about being educated about oppression, recognizing 
it and doing your part to stop it.”

� STEVE WOZNIAK WILL 
DISCUSS TECHNOLOGY AND HIS BACKGROUND AT APPLE.
By GENARRO SCIBELLI
Alligator Contributing Writer
In 1976, Stephen Wozniak with-
drew from the University of Cali-fornia at Berkeley to form Apple Computer Inc. with his good friend Steve Jobs.   
Nine years later, Wozniak was 
awarded the National Medal of Technology by President Ronald Reagan for revolutionizing infor -
mation technology with the Apple I and Apple II personal comput-ers.  
On Monday night, Wozniak, 
chief scientist for technology com -
pany Fusion-io, will speak at the O’Connell Center.
The doors will open at 7 p.m., 
and the event will begin at 7:30 
p.m.
The event is sponsored by Ac-
cent Speakers Bureau and is free to 
the public.
Wozniak will share his insights 
on topics including today’s tech-nology and his drive to build a computer that revolutionized the  industry 34 years ago.  
In 2006, Wozniak published an 
autobiography titled “iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun 
Doing It.”
Zack Gold-
stein, Accent chairman, pre-dicted that the 
event will have 
a large turnout 
and that students 
who plan to at-tend the show 
should arrive 20 minutes early.   
“UF provides the Student Body 
with so many great resources,” Goldstein said.  
“The chance to gain insight 
from someone who helped cre-ate the computers we use today 
and who remains on the forefront 
of the technology industry is not something that is available to many 
schools around the country.”
Goldstein said Wozniak will be 
paid $70,000 to speak at the event.Apple co-founder to

Two-hundred hours; 12,000 min-
utes; 720,000 seconds. That’s how 
long Chad McLean hopes to bowl this week. 
McLean, 26, is currently attempt-
ing to shatter the world record for most consecutive hours of tenpin bowling.
“I’ve been bowling in a league 
since I was 3, and I wanted to do something that would make an im-pression on the sport,” he said.
He works as the manager at Two 
Turkeys Pro Shop, located inside the 
AMF Alley Katz Corner bowling al-
ley . 
The current record, 125 hours, 
was set by Stephen Shanabrook of Plano, Texas. McLean is attempting to crush the record by 75 hours. 
If he continues bowling, McLean 
could break the record as early as to-day and reach his goal of 200 hours 
on Saturday, depending on breaks.
On Thursday , McLean said he 
was feeling physically weak but was 
mentally strong. Preparing for the event, he thought he would have the opposite problem.
The rules for record-breaking 
are simple but strict. For every full hour of bowling, McLean is granted 
five minutes of break time. He can 
choose to use the breaks individu-ally or save them and take longer breaks. Also, while bowling, he can-not sit down.
McLean’s friends have been sup-porting him with all of his needs. They’ve been getting him food, tape, bandages and occasionally handing him the bowling ball.
Charles V olkert, a shift leader at 
Alley Katz, said he has no doubt in his mind that McLean will be able to do it.
“It’s amazing to see someone 
have that much willpower.”
Another manager even brought 
in a king-sized inflatable mattress for McLean to rest on. The managers rearranged the desks in their offices 
so McLean would have a comfort-
able and quiet place to rest.
McLean said this is much harder 
than he originally thought it would be. Physically , he trained for this, but mentally, there was no way to train.
“I thought that since I had the 
physical component down, I was going to rock and bowl no problem. 
I bowled for two months straight,” 
McLean said. “I treated my practice like a workout.”
He said his major at Kennesaw 
State University was exercise and health science so he knew how to properly train and prepare his diet. Besides staying up and playing video games, though, McLean said 
there wasn’t much he could do to 
train for the lack of sleep.
While McLean is trying to break 
the record,  funds are also being raised for Haven Hospice and Mak-ing Strides Against Breast Cancer via a donation bucket.
To stay up, McLean said that 
people talking to him and support-ing him have been the best methods. He said he hasn’t tried any full-can 
energy drinks but had a couple of 
5-Hour Energy shots.
Beau Gassendanner, 21, a friend 
of McLean’s, has been with him at the alley for a majority of the time so far. He said McLean seems to do better when there are more people around. Early mornings are worst.
“I think he’ll break the record. 
He’s just got a ton of support,” Gas-sendanner said. “He has a lot of ded-ication and a lot of motivation.”
When McLean gets a chance 
for sleep, he said he has to use ev-
ery minute because they are few in 
number and rare in appearance. Even after suffering during his 
favorite sport, McLean says that he 
will still keep bowling.
“I’ve been bowling for 23 years,” 
McLean said. “A little more is not 
going to do anything.”

Machen: Administration has been talking to board about block tuition
The final step for the proposal would be at a special budget 
committee meeting in February , where, if approved, UF would 
be put on a track to implement block tuition by the fall.
Budget and Finance Committee Chairman Tico Perez said 
he was surprised at the attention the issue has received, citing 
the fact that the board was only approving a regulation change 
and not approving block tuition at any university.
Machen said the administration has been informally ex-
plaining the block tuition concept to the Board of Trustees. 
He said there is initial support from the trustees, but he does 
not know if the board would approve the measure.“It would depend on the case we make,” he said.Students for a Democratic Society had planned to present a 
list of demands to the board on Thursday but left after learning there was no public comment allowed during the meeting.
Dave Schneider, leader of the group, said he sees a move 
toward block tuition as a means to move students through the system faster — a system he feels is flawed.
“The point of this is to turn the uni-
versities in the system into degree mills,” he said.
Student Body President Ashton Charles, who was present 
for the meeting and holds a seat on the Board of Trustees, said Student Government cannot take an official stance on a pro-posal that doesn’t yet exist.
“There are too many things that are unknown to actually 
speak out about it now,” she said.
Another regulation change discussed Thursday allows uni-
versities to propose the implementation of market-rate tuition for certain continuing education courses and distance educa-tion graduate-level online courses. 
The change would have to be approved at the board’s next 
meeting.
According to the meeting materials, the market-rate plan 
would not affect certain education, health professions and se-curity and emergency services programs. Universities will also be able submit an exemption request for other programs.BOARD , from page 1

Hutchinson said. 
Although the performers are all lo-
cal, the artists come from as far away as Minnesota or California. 
“Many are nationally known, so 
we’re very excited about that,” Piper said of the show’s artists. 
The art show began with 600 appli-
cants that a committee narrowed down to fill 250 spots.
Event planners said the slow econo-
my did minimally affect the number of applying artists this year due to factors such as travel expenses. Usually there 
are about 650. 
“The economy seems to be coming 
back,” Hutchinson said. “It’s not as 
scary for these artists.”
Local acrylic painter Miriam No-
vack, who likens her work to looking into a kaleidoscope, has been partici-pating in the art show for 10 years. 
“Gainesville’s a small city , yet we 
have a top-notch show,” said Novack, who will be at Spot 51 in the show. 
Although she does about 12 art fes-
tivals a year, Gainesville’s is one of her favorites.
“It’s nice to have loyal people who 
follow your work,” she said. 250 artists will display work

town bars,” Bruce said. “I think this place has a 
cooler vibe, and it’s nice not to have beer spilt on you by frat boys.”
Hughes said the renovation costs to open 
the bar were $25,000 and that $10,000 was spent solely on repairing things the previous owners left behind.
“There was a smell and stickiness to the 
place when we began cleaning,” Johnston said.  “We worked really hard to provide a place that will be comfortable for everyone.”
Loosey’s offers 20 beers on tap, 23 bottled 
beers and a full liquor bar. Focusing on lo-cal microbreweries is important to Hughes, and he also wants to bring more scotches and bourbons that can’t be offered anywhere else in 
town.
Chelsea Sims, a 23-year-old law student, 
said she enjoyed going to Market Street with 
friends because the bar was so close to her house. “I love dive bars, and not having to swim 
through a crowd of 200 people to get a beer is a plus,” Sims said.  “It’s cheaper to drink at home, but this place is definitely somewhere I 
will continue to go.” 
Sims said another reason she came to Mar -
ket Street was the concerts, and Loosey’s plans 
to continue to provide live entertainment as well as a variety of themed events, like karaoke 
and comedy nights.
The current hours are from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
Monday through Saturday.  The owners also 
plan to start serving food in January.
“Hopefully down the road, our bar will be 
the cool place to go,” Hughes said.MARKET , from page 1

On how to find that one missing sock
As humans, we tend to lose lots of things. 
We lose our teeth when we’re younger, our 
hair when we’re older and our minds at every 
age in between. 
Yet in the frantic search for a misplaced sock, we tend 
to forget about everything else we may have lost grow-
ing up. 
Growing up means losing a lot more than just baby fat. 
Imaginary friends, innocence and honesty are all taken as 
collateral damage of aging. 
As adults, we lose more than just the occasional pound 
here and there. 
We lose jobs, relationships and friends. Sometimes it’s 
our own decision to lose these things and other times it’s anything but our own. 
The fact that we all lose things along the way is a uni-
versal feeling. 
We all experience the pain of a lost love, the agony of a 
misplaced set of keys and the humility of having lost one or two left shoes. 
The art of losing is a simple one — one minute it’s 
yours and the next it’s not.
That’s simplicity at its finest. The difficult part of los-
ing something is the aftermath. 
Nothing exemplifies this better than cleaning up af-
ter a breakup. During this clean sweep, you tend to find 
things you couldn’t while you were together. Things 
thought to be lost forever tend to appear and remind you something less tangible has been lost. Misplaced pictures, ticket stubs, love letters, half a set of handcuffs, balloons 
of a happier time, all seem to woefully materialize like 
totems of lost relationships. 
Naturally, we tend to look for things we have lost. Through fliers posted for lost cats, beds upturned for lost money and closets ravaged for 
a lost sweater, we instinctively 
attempt to regain what was once ours. 
Loss is often a domino effect. 
Sometimes we lose sleep, peace of mind and points on a test as a 
result of losing a job, friend or lover.
 At other times we lose more important things like 
sense of self or self-respect. Either way, when losing we 
tend to lose more than one thing at a time.
 Just like the saying “death comes in threes,” loss 
comes exponentially. It just depends on how far along 
you let it go.
 The trick is remembering that all which is lost is even-
tually found. 
Whether it’s found by you or by someone else, every-
thing is eventually picked up off the ground. Lost jobs are filled, lost lovers are re-loved, lost friends are befriend-
ed. 
Yet we often can’t help but remember that that was lost 
with a tinge of pain. Just like phantom limbs, the pain re-
mains as a constant souvenir we never intended to buy.
So next time you find yourself hysterically looking for 
that lone sock, remember it’s bound to show up eventu-ally. 
Whether it turns up inside your dryer or inside your 
dog’s mouth, it all will reappear eventually. 
Hassan Casanova is a third-year family, youth and com-
munity science student at Santa Fe College. His column appears every Friday.After this week, we’re seeing red. Like much of the country, we’ve been watching with 
astonishment and incredulity as the entire country faces the inevitability of turning into fake Mohawk Indians as we brace for the biggest tea party this country has seen south of Boston. 
And we’re still hoping it’s a dream we’ll wake up from. 
Maybe even a “Freaky Friday” type thing. Or maybe our hopes for our newfound, post-election reality to be a “Freaky Friday” false alarm are just so we can see Lindsay Lohan back in her days of alleged pre-cocaine glory. 
We know we told you last week this would be our last 
politically themed anything for a while as we bask in the glory that is the lame duck season with the absence of po-litical mailers and TV ads, but we just can’t leave any of 
this unsaid and swept under the rug. We fibbed, Gators. 
But everything’s fine. The Department of Darts and Lau-rels is here to make you feel all warm and cozy following one of the scariest elections in history. 
So, in light of our we-spoke-too-soon fib, we’d like to 
present you with your very own Mostly-Election-Themed-Because-We’re-So-Angry-With-Everyone-We’re-Really-Considering-Moving-To-Connecticut-To-Get-The-Heck-Out-Of-Florida-And-Just-To-Show-How-Mad-We-Are-
We’re-Boycotting-All-Tea edition of….
Darts & Darts
That’s right. We’re so angry, and we have nowhere 
to direct any of this anger so we’re just not drinking any 
more tea. 
And if you read our editorial Thursday, we might not 
be drinking any more coffee either after the Board of Gov-ernors amended a regulation allowing them to now enter -
tain block tuition proposals from Florida universities.
So we’re throwing all of them a big We-Realize-You-
Have-Enough-Money-To-Pay-For-Extra-Credits-You-Aren’t-Taking-So-Yo-Can-Pay-For-Our-Classes-With-Your-Big-Wig-Wallets-As-We-Poor-College-Students-Continue-To-Starve DART. 
And, as we said, this is a mostly political-themed edi-
tion today, and we don’t have enough Darts to throw, so get ready.
Really, Florida? Really? Half of you voted to elect a 
fraud?
The bald man behind the biggest Medicare fraud in 
history is now running the fourth most populous state. We know Alex Sink wasn’t the best choice, but to elect a man who invoked the Fifth Amendment to keep secrets 75 
times was probably not the best idea you all have had. 
Say goodbye to gay rights, abortion rights, gun control, 
clean energy and general integrity and honesty. And Cu-
bans, you might want to just lie low for a while. We’re sure 
Scott has a plan to find out you’re illegal somehow. 
But we’re going to pull a fast one on you. We’re not 
even throwing the Mr. Clean wannabe a Dart. Nope. He is, 
unfortunately, our rightfully elected governor. And we’ll deal with it for four years until all of you make your next 
biggest mistake.
But half of you marked the oval for his name. And for 
that, we’re throwing the entire state of Florida our entire 
arsenal we had shipped in to fully express how ridiculous 
this situation is What-Were-You-Thinking DARTS. 
The entire state. That’s right. We hope throwing each 
and every one of you a Dart wakes you up to keep this bald man to a one-term governor.
We’re so disappointed, Floridians.

Letters to the Editor
Reader appreciates columnist’s views
Bravo to columnist Nate Rushing for 
his Thursday column. 
Though many of us can agree, let’s 
compare apples to apples. The spectacular 
musical films of the midcentury were not the pop music of the Big Band Era, nor do they bear much resemblance to Disney’s 
corporate tween products.
Yes, the Hollywood studio system is, 
alas, gone.
 Thankfully, those performances are im-
mortalized on film. But talent does exist today (on Broadway). And for tomorrow’s stars, we need look no further than our 
own UF theater and music departments.

Philosophy graduates aren’t poor
Thursday’s cartoon “Spin to Win”  might 
be amusing, but it leans on a myth about philosophy majors the data simply do not 
support.
A 2008 study by PayScale Inc. of college 
majors and salaries actually shows phi-losophy majors do well in monetary terms. 
The study examined the careers of students over the long term and compiled informa-tion on the median salaries of 50 different majors, both at the start of their careers and 
at the midpoint. 
It might surprise many of your readers 
to see philosophy majors rank 16th out of 
those 50 majors; they do better than every 
other humanities and social-science major 
on this score. 
Those median mid-career salaries are 
higher even than those for accounting, architecture, psychology, marketing and business management majors. If we look at median starting salaries, philosophy ma-
jors still do reasonably well, ranking 28th 
out of 50, which is just slightly under the halfway point.
As these data make clear, the common 
view that philosophy majors face a finan-cially impoverished future is simply false.
For more on the major, including more 
information on how students do in their fu-ture careers, take a look at the philosophy 
department’s Web page www.phil.ufl.edu.

Sex.
Have I gotten your attention now? I thought so.
I’m no conservative, but I’ve found myself fuss-
ing over the cinematic (and social) fixation with sex of these days. 
Not just any plain old sex, though. Teen sex.Riddle me this: When’s the last time you saw a main-
stream young adult flick and the content did not mention virginity or the dirty deed?
Sex is everywhere these days. Lately, cinema’s naughty infatuation has transcended 
to an adolescent level. 
With movies like “Easy A” and “The Virginity Hit” be-
ing fired at us left and right, it’s kind of hard to ignore the abundance of sex in film.
Don’t get me wrong — I’m well aware that movies 
have featured people “doing it” for ages. 
But the mainstream film industry has been pandering 
this once-taboo content to younger and younger demo-graphics each passing decade, and desensitizing youths to the point where sex is presented to them as a casual 
social hurdle.
Now when I say “youth,” I primarily mean people be-
tween the ages of 16 and 23. For those of you who detest this 
general label, sit tight and bear with 
me.
In our culture, sex is unavoid-
able. 
Historically, movies containing sexual content have 
been tailored to a fully grown, swanky, martini-sipping 
generation who gasped at a hint of thigh.
But this definitely is not your grandparents’ sexy fan-
fare.
Teen cinema has been openly acquainted with the 
quest for sex dating all the way back to the groovy ’70s (“Little Darlings,” anyone?). 
In the ’80s it had brat pack fads like “The Breakfast 
Club,” “Weird Science” and “Sixteen Candles,” 
In the late ’90s there came a little film called “American 
Pie.”
This is child’s play compared to the past few months 
in movie releases. 
Now it’s tales of high school sex gossip gone awry, a 
documentary of a sexually desperate nerd and a Facebook genius who admits that his site was a tool to score him a 
little sugar.
I’m not making any naive or obtuse assumptions here. I know that our generation’s not the first to explore sex cinematically, but we’re absolutely the first to be bom-barded with popular films glorifying sex-based youth 
struggles (“Superbad” and “The Girl Next Door” ringing 
any bells?). Not bad films per say, but films that demand sex as a required checkpoint in high school or early col-lege.
Because how dare anyone be a virgin these days? It’s, 
like, so lame. 
Virginity’s a delicate subject, and cultural revolutions 
have brought this once private matter into public scru-tiny. 
In any case, you’re judged for a choice that’s nobody’s 
business but your own.
Sex has become an out-in-the-open social disease, a 
parasite of anxiety and expectation. 
It’s a teenage dilemma, a generational obstacle … but 
it’s not everything. 
Or am I just being a giant square?Well, on behalf of all us nerds out there, I think Hol-
lywood should take a few months off and check itself into 
sex rehab.

Speaking OutBy MATT RUBIN

Going to college for the first time can be a difficult expe-
rience for anyone.
It can be just as difficult — if not harder — for someone 
transferring to a new school.
For sophomore opposite hitter Tangerine Wiggs, the 
decision to transfer from Washington State has paid divi-
dends for herself and Florida.
“My experience here has been really great so far,” Wiggs 
said. “The coaching staff has been really helpful in hav-
ing me adjust. The team has been really welcoming and 
showed me the ropes.”
Wiggs and the No. 1 Gators (20-1, 13-0 Southeastern 
Conference) will take on Georgia (11-14, 3-11 SEC) tonight 
in Athens, Ga., at 7.
“It’s definitely different than coming in as a freshman 
just because in volleyball I’ve had to learn a whole new system,” Wiggs said. “I was taught one way for so long and 
then I’m brought here and I have to have a beginner’s mind 
again. Picking up the system didn’t come easy and there is 
still a lot I need to learn.”
As a redshirt freshman for Washington State last year, 
Wiggs saw action in only 10 sets. During her limited play-
ing time, she recorded nine kills on 32 total attacks with a 
hitting percentage of .031. She also had just two digs and 
two blocks.
This year Wiggs has played in all 74 of Florida’s sets. 
She has 125 kills on 305 total attacks and is hitting .289. 
She also has 24 digs and 69 blocks — good for third on the 
team.
“She has made a huge impact because in the past we’ve 
kind of moved players to play that position,” coach Mary Wise said. “Callie [Rivers] could easily be playing on the right side, but by having Tang on the right has allowed us to put Callie on the left. And we’ve seen how well that’s paid off for us. 
“She’s a point-scorer for us. You earn points by kills and 
blocks. She’s a very long, high-contact player. She keeps 
getting better and better.”
The Gators are taking on the Bulldogs for the second time this season. The Gators won 3-1 (19-25, 25-20, 25-19, 
25-21) in Gainesville on Oct. 17.
“My favorite thing about UF is my team,” Wiggs said. 
“Being new I don’t really know anybody yet. I spend so much time with them. We spend time with each other be-
cause we have to, but they’re the type of people I spend 
time with because I want to.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2010

UF opposite hitter� HE WILL FACE BRADLEY 
KAHN OF STANFORD TODAY.
By STEPHEN SHEEHAN
Alligator Writer 
 
Senior Alexandre Lacroix took 
the first step toward a national title 
Thursday, as he won his first-round match at the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Champion-
ships in Flushing, N.Y. 
Lacroix proved worthy of his 
No. 9 national ranking by defeat-
ing Columbia’s Haig Shneiderman, whose school is roughly 10 miles from the USTA Billie Jean King Na-tional Tennis Center, in straight sets (6-2, 6-3). 
“It was an extremely impres-
sive performance to be able to beat sort of a hometown guy,” UF coach Andy Jackson said.
With the victory, Lacroix ad-
vanced to the round of 16, where he will face his highest-ranked op-ponent of the season today in Stan-ford junior Bradley Klahn, who is 
the fourth seed in the tourney.
No. 3 Klahn has been a force 
since he was a  freshman, when he 
was named the ITA National Rook-ie of the Year. As a sophomore, he was both a singles and doubles All-American and won the NCAA singles championship. 
However, this will not be the 
first time the two have faced each 
other. Lacroix defeat-ed Klahn at the ITA National Team In-door Championships in 2009. 
“There’s going to 
be no doubt in his 
mind that he can beat him because he has beaten him,” Jackson said. 
Women have early success: It 
was also a good first day for the women’s team, as Allie Will and Alex Cercone advanced to the sin-gles round of 16. And the team of Sofie Oyen and Will advanced to the doubles quarterfinals. 
No. 5 Will certainly earned her 
victory after she battled for three sets (6-2, 4-6, 6-4) against Lucia Batta of UNLV . Coming back from a 4-3 deficit to win three straight 
games in the third set, Will dis-
played her signature toughness, coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
The talented sophomore also 
shined in her doubles match with Oyen, as the duo took down top-seeded Hilary Barte and Mallory Burdette of Stanford (9-7). Thornqvist said the team played 
fearlessly against a very good op-ponent. 
“You can’t just put the ball in 
and hope for the best,” he said. “You have to go in for it and win.” 
Only a freshman, Cercone 
picked up a straight-sets victory (6-2, 6-2) against No. 120 Nicole Bart-nik of Columbia.  
The Gators’ lone loss of the day 
came when Olivia Janowicz lost 
to Connie Hsu of Pennsylvania in 
straight sets (6-3, 6-3). Janowicz earned a spot in the tournament af-ter winning the singles champion-ship at the ITA Southeast Regional.

The UF men’s swimming and diving 
team remains undefeated on away turf 
this season. 
Florida tallied another away win with 
its 160-136 victory against LSU on Thurs-
day, running their road record to 2-0 on 
the year.
Though some swimmers were absent 
due to school obligations, the Gators won 10 of the 16 events in the Baton Rouge, La., 
meet. 
“It’s always good to win a conference meet on the road,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“Brett (Fraser) and Sebastien (Rousseau) 
really competed well for us.” 
Fraser dominated in the 100- and 200-
yard backstroke, and Rousseau nabbed 
wins in both the 200- and 500-yard free-
style events. 
Victories were plentiful for the Gators, 
but most were competing in events outside 
of their comfort zones against the Tigers, raising the degree of difficulty.
“I don’t normally swim the 200 or 500,” 
Rousseau said. “Everyone kind of mixed around. We swam well and got the job done.”Both Rousseau and Fraser also contrib-
uted to the squad’s victory in the 400-yard medley relay along with senior Conor 
Dwyer and junior Jeffrey Raymond.
 The quartet finished 
with a time of 3:19.52, a season high for the Gators 
as well as the fourth-fast-
est time in the country 
this season. 
Dwyer, the reign-
ing National Swimmer of the Week, also emerged victories in the 100- and 200-yard breaststroke. Dwyer clocked in at 2:00.94 in the 200, the fastest time in the Southeast-ern Conference for the event this season.
Sophomore Jason Taylor, who was 
pinned as a “bonus surprise” by Troy due to his performance in the Georgia meet, 
came in first place in the 1,650-yard free-
style event. 
“A lot of the younger swimmers are 
stepping over,” Fraser said. “Scott Som-
mer really turned it up.”
The sophomore claimed the second-
place spot in both the 100- and 200-yard 
freestyle events.  
The Gators will return to the water and 
try to keep their perfect road record in the Georgia Tech Invitational in Atlanta, on Nov. 19.Gators defeat Tigers; Dwyer records SEC-best time in 200Tennis

Picks 
Column
SITE: Vanderbilt Stadium, 
Nashville, Tenn., (cap. 39,790)
KICKOFF: Saturday, 12:21 p.m.
TV/RADIO: FOX/WRUF AM850
Just one more week until the South 
Carolina-Florida showdown. 
But we here at the alligatorSports  
Brand Picks Column like to take life one 
day at a time. So that’s why we decided to take a look into this week’s South Carolina-Arkansas matchup.
Like Gamecocks coach Steve Spur -
rier, who yanked starting quarterback Stephen Garcia against Auburn because he was playing stinky, it’s all about the NOW for us. 
But it’s still up for debate if South 
Carolina will take the same approach as its coach. This contest presents the dan-ger of the Gamecocks looking ahead 
to a potential SEC East Championship 
game against the Gators.
We left it to alligatorSports’ Mike 
and Tyler to debate the outcome.
Arkansas (+4) will pull the upset 
because... 
The Razorbacks are just as disci-
plined as Michael Christopher McCall 
during no-shave November. 
Mike entered a beard competition 
against friends with more grizzly per -
sonalities really just to humor them. We 
all knew he could grow a decent beard. 
But compared to his genetically gifted 
buddies, we expected him to look like a 12-year-old.
Instead, he’s exceeded expectations 
and has his opponents thinking they 
underestimated him.
Likewise, Arkansas quarterback 
Ryan Mallett entered the season with 
all the tools to be an All-SEC passer. But 
he’s not playing for one of the confer -
ence’s traditional powers, and we’ve 
seen plenty of players fail to carry less-talented teams (see: Snead, Jevan).
But Mallett has met expectations, 
leading the nation’s second-best pass-ing attack and throwing for more yards than anyone else in the SEC. Sure, his 
golden arm didn’t get the job done in 
the second half of the Alabama game, but nobody is flawless.

Coach Urban Meyer and the Gators will face a team in Vanderbilt on Sat-
urday that has the worst offense in the SEC. 
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
With Florida’s track record against Vanderbilt, there’s never 
really a bad time to face the Commodores.
And this year’s matchup falls on an especially good spot on 
the calendar.
A week removed from its most promising offensive perfor -
mance of the season, the Gators will head to Nashville, Tenn., for 
what amounts to a warm up before a likely Southeastern Confer -
ence East-deciding showdown with South Carolina on Nov. 13.
UF has won 19 straight against Vandy, but this year has prov-
en that no opponent is sure-fire Gator bait.
That, combined with an 11:21 a.m. (CDT) kickoff and expected 
temperatures around 40 degrees, has Florida coach Urban Meyer nervous.
“It is a concern because you know that the team you are play-
ing is one of those teams that is looking to get you, and they have the talent to get you,” Meyer said, pointing to Vandy’s mobile quarterback, Larry Smith, as another reason for worry.
“So yes, that is uncomfortable. … There’s nothing we can do 
about it. We just have to go and play our tails off.”
In truth, the Gators just have to wake up — which Meyer list-
ed as his biggest concern — and avoid falling flat on their backs.
The Commodores’ offense is the worst in the conference, and 
since topping Ole Miss in September, they’ve been outscored 113-21 in three straight SEC losses. To make matters worse, running back and kick returner Warren Norman, who ranked third in the SEC for all-purpose yards per game, was declared out for the sea-son this week with a wrist injury.
Still, Meyer said he isn’t worried about his team overlooking 
Vanderbilt, partly because of the Commodores’ 21-7 loss to South Carolina two weeks ago, when the teams were tied until deep into the third quarter.
“The greatest thing that happens is seeing film of them beat-
ing Ole Miss and beating South Carolina for a good portion of the game,” Meyer said. “We spend as much time working on our offense as anything.”

against Georgia, and between a no-huddle attack and rotating UF looks to avoid letdown against Vandy

Coach Becky Burleigh’s midweek prognosis 
was spot on. Maybe next time, the Gators will pay attention.
In a wild roller-coaster match that saw mul-
tiple blown leads and goals in bunches, No. 8 Florida clung to a 5-3 victory over Vanderbilt in the first round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament in Orange Beach, Ala., on Thurs-day. “We thought we had it, but you can never 
underestimate a team when it could be their last 
game of the year,” midfielder McKenzie Barney said. “They fought until the last second, so we had to fight until the last sec-
ond, too.” 
Florida twice blew two-goal 
leads but held on with a couple 
of late goals from two of the SEC’s leading scor -
ers.
“We knew they were going to throw ev-erything at us,” Burleigh said. “I tip my hat to 
Vandy for continuing to play hard the whole match.”
The Gators moved to 6-0 all time against 
the Commodores in tournament play, yet this match had little resemblance to Florida’s tradi-
tional series dominance. 
Despite jumping out to a 1-0 advantage 
midway through the first half, the Gators often 
played in their own defensive third.

“We’re going to have to be on 
our P’s and Q’s for sure,” Caldwell said. “I’ve been very proud watch-ing [Florida’s offense] progress. Ob-viously , I’d prefer they hadn’t before we played them, but it’s impressive to see how much progress they’ve made playing some of the younger players they’ve been playing.”
The two-headed quarterback 
strategy might sprout a third nog-gin this week, when tight end Jor -
dan Reed is expected to join the fray . Reed carried three times for 19 yards against the Bulldogs, and Meyer said he planned to let him throw the ball Saturday.
Reed is the best fit at wildcat 
quarterback because he’s a threat both running and throwing, and 
Brantley isn’t bothered by his posi-
tion becoming even more crowded so the Gators can run the option.
“That’s what we have done re-
ally well here for the past few years, and we wanted to get that back in the system,” Brantley said. “If that means we put someone else back there to run it, then by all means let’s 
do it. That’s what has been success-
ful, and that’s what we’re going to keep doing.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2010 �  ALLIGATOR, 15

FOOTBALL , from page 14
SEC second team, scored two goals, including the strike that 
sent the Gators into the semifinals. Barney, who added the in-surance goal just two minutes after Annis’ go-ahead score (86th minute), also contributed two goals. 
“I loved contributing two goals,” Barney said. “But Tahnai’s 
goal was so huge. It won us the game.”
The Gators entered halftime with a one-goal lead. And four 
minutes into the second half Barney scored on a nice hustle play, cleaning up a bobble by Vandy’s goalie. The 2-0 deficit looked too difficult for the Commodores to overcome, as the Gators had surrendered just two or more goals twice all sea-son.
However, less than thirty seconds later Vanderbilt caught 
Florida napping and cut the lead in half, setting up a wild final 
35 minutes of soccer. 
Erika Tymrak, a first-team All-SEC selection, nailed a liner 
from 20 yards out that hit the post and ricocheted in, putting 
the Gators up 3-1. But that lead was short-lived when goal keeper Katie Fraine let a ball go through her legs. 
In the 83rd minute, the Commodores’ perseverance paid off 
when they tied the game on a shot from about 18 yards away that slipped into the goal past an astonished Fraine.
But Florida never panicked, revealing the composure Bur -
leigh has been preaching all season. 
“I thought we showed a lot of resiliency,” Burleigh said. 
“Just the confidence of our team’s ability to get it done re-gardless of the score.”
With the win, UF advances to face Georgia in the second 
round of the SEC Tournament tonight at 8:30. UF to face UGA tonight

Tyler Jett is pulling for the Razorbacks because Arkansas 
quarterback Ryan Mallett gives him hope that one day, he too 
can live a normal life.
Both are freakishly tall, but Mallett’s arm strength saved 
him from the perils of being a social outcast, a path Tyler has slid down thanks to having no discernible talent outside of be-ing able to stick out like a sore thumb.
Tyler sees a kindred spirit in Mallett, who endured ridicule 
for having to ride a four-wheeled scooter around campus on 
one knee in the off-season to protect his injured foot. People 
point and laugh at Tyler’s mode of transportation too, as he crams his lanky frame into a Camry and drives around looking like the Very Tall Man from the Simpsons.
But Saturday will be a very sad day for Tyler, when he’ll 
have to watch his hero falter against the mighty Gamecocks.

  Now, on to the picks!On top for the second straight week with a record of 53-35 
is Gatorbait.net’s Keith “I’m perfect” Niebuhr, who went 10-0 in last week’s picks. Just for that we won’t insult you this week. Consider yourself lucky . But that means it will be a double burn the next time around.
Coming in second with a 45-43 record is alligatorSports 
editor Anthony “I miss the blatant homoeroticism of Miami” 
Chiang, who became wistful upon viewing an old photo of he 
and a friend staring at each other as they lathered their own 
bare upper bodies. There was also a boat involved. 
Tied for second is alligatorSports assistant editor Tyler “I 
just want Cuban food” Jett, who makes a trip to Flaco’s every 
night just to realize it’s closed. He looks like a sad kid near 
the holidays staring through the window helplessly . One day you’ll eat a medianoche, buddy. One day.
In fourth with a record of 44-44 is alligatorSports’ Mike “Call 
me Abe” McCall, who “mistakenly” shaved his facial hair to 
resemble that of Abraham Lincoln’s as part of an office beard-
shaving contest. Halloween was last week, Mike.
Tied for fourth is Kyle “Drunk people are so dumb” Maistri, 
who instigated an argument over the Gators with a very drunk student. We know you will debate people to the death, but this was one you just couldn’t win. Blame it on the al-al-al-alcohol.
Next, at 42-46, is the Miami Herald’s Joe “Put a can of Skoal 
next to your pillow and think of me” Goodman, who’s having 
a rough time on road trips covering the Miami Heat without 
McCall, his nighttime cuddle buddy. 
Coming in seventh with a 41-47 record is The Gainesville 
Sun’s Edward “Disney characters don’t know anything about higher education, anyway” Aschoff, who got into a heated de-bate with Tinker Bell about whether FSU was a better school than Florida the night before Halloween, only to have his hon-or salvaged by a lesbian brawler. All of that is true. Seriously.
And in dead-ass last place (by virtue of the alphabet) with a 
piss-poor record of 41-47 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Christ-mas just got real” Jones, who can’t wait for his favorite time 
of year. Only 50 more days until you get to shuffle into your 
parents’ living room in your Atlanta Braves pajamas and see

Florida’s stable of runners is 
deeper than it’s been all season.
Coach Urban Meyer said run-
ning backs Mike Gillislee (ham-
string) and Emmanuel Moody 
(ankle) practiced at full speed this week and will be available Satur -
day at Vanderbilt. 
“Moody’s had his best prac-
tice,” Meyer said. “He looked at me today and said, ‘That’s the first time in a month (my ankle) feels great.’”
Meyer expected both to be avail-
able last week against Georgia, but neither looked game-ready in the days leading up to that contest. 
Gillislee has gained 202 yards 
and four touchdowns on 37 car -
ries, while Moody ran 48 times for 162 yards.
Despite being limited in prac-
tice this week, running back Jeff Demps (sprained left foot) is also expected to play Saturday.
And even with all three run-
ning backs available, Meyer said wide receiver Chris Rainey will rotate into the backfield in certain 
packages. Playing in his first game 
since Sept. 11, Rainey carried the ball 16 times for 84 yards and a touchdown against Georgia.
Florida has two more options 
in the backfield with quarterbacks Trey Burton and Jordan Reed. Bur -
ton led the Gators last Saturday with 17 carries for 110 yards, in-
cluding a 51-yard touchdown in 
the fourth quarter.
And Reed will have an in-
creased role against the Commo-dores, Meyer said. The redshirt freshman gained 19 yards on a pair of second-quarter runs Saturday.
“He’s earned his right, and he 
can help us,” said Meyer, who added that fans should not be surprised to see Reed throw this week.
Injuries: Defensive tackle 
Jaye Howard’s (ankle) chance of playing Saturday “does not look 
good,” Meyer said. Wide receiver 
Andre Debose (ankle) will play. Left guard Carl Johnson (strained calf) practiced Thursday. Meyer not involved: Meyer 
said the NCAA has not contacted him in its investigation of Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, who transferred to Blinn (Texas) Col-
lege from Florida after the 2008 
season.
A representative for Newton re-
portedly told a former Mississippi State quarterback last December that Newton would play for the Bulldogs this season in exchange for $180,000.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2010

How long until they have to stop giv-
ing out the Heisman Trophy?
I asked that jokingly to a couple 
of other writers after finding out about ES-
PN’s report that a man claiming to represent 
Auburn quarterback and current Heisman front-runner Cam Newton asked Mississip-pi State for $180,000 to deliver the junior col-
lege transfer to Starkville. According to the 
report, the going rate was $200,000 for the 
6-foot-6, dual-threat signal caller, but they were willing to give ex-Florida offense coor -
dinator Dan Mullen a discount. How nice. 
Before I go any further, even if someone 
representing Newton asked Mississippi State for money, that doesn’t mean Newton TOOK money from Auburn. And it doesn’t mean that a man claiming to represent New-ton actually represented Newton, as convo-luted as that may sound. 
Until the NCAA comes out and sanctions someone following an investigation, New-
ton’s hands are clean. 
That being said, the story sounds pretty 
thorough and believable, especially consid-
ering Cam’s father Cecil Newton’s church somehow found the money to renovate its out-of-code facilities despite Cam’s mother, Jackie, admitting the church is extremely 
poor. 
Perhaps this story will be resolved by the 
end of this football season. Perhaps it will be 
resolved before Newton jumps to the NFL, be it after this season or the next. Or perhaps it will be resolved five years into Newton’s professional career — the same amount of time it took the NCAA to hit USC with sanc-tions from its Reggie Bush investigation.
And like Bush — to adapt a quote from 
the greatest show in the history of televi-sion, HBO’s “The Wire” — maybe Newton wins a Heisman with this stuff, and maybe he’ll have to give it back. 
But if this matter 
isn’t resolved by the 
time the Heisman 
committee calls its fi-nalists to New York, and it almost certain-
ly will not be, we’re 
about to enter a new 
discussion to the col-
lege football arena. 
How will suspicion of taking improper 
benefits affect Heisman voting?
Just as baseball writers are now wrestling 
with how to judge potential Hall of Fame careers by admitted and suspected steroid users, Heisman voters will be forced to choose: cast a vote for Cam and run the risk of having to take away that trophy a few years down the line, or play it safe and pick a guy that may not be as deserving based on 
performance. 
It’s a decision I’m glad I don’t have to 
make. 
Ideally, we would all like to advise the 
voters to pick the best candidate, as Newton 
and everyone else in this country are inno-cent until proven guilty. 
And maybe they will award the trophy 
to Newton. 
But how many trophies will have to be 
given back before it starts to affect their thinking?
How many vacated Heismans will be 
needed to tarnish the legacy of college sports’ most prestigious individual award?
I don’t know the answer to either of 
those questions, but my best guess would be somewhere between zero and one.
Unfortunately, we’ll find out soon 
enough.
Do allegations about Newton spell end of Heisman Trophy?
