LongestThe
YardNot all yards are created equal.
Sure, the hash marks are evenly 
spaced, but move far enough down the 
field and it feels like there’s more than three feet 
separating each yard line from the next.
A two-yard carry on first and 10 is vastly dif-
ferent from two yards on fourth and 1, and one-yard runs are almost always easier to come by at midfield than around the goal line.
Short-yardage plays are football at its most 
basic, brutal core. Thousands of pounds collide at the line of scrimmage, often with both teams being near-certain that the play is headed right up the gut.
The man-on-man battles at the line are never 
more important than in these situations, and the margin for error is minuscule. A lineman push-ing forward a split-second late can mean the dif-ference between a first down and a turnover, a touchdown and a field goal. 
Teams that regularly capitalize on short-
yardage plays gain a huge advantage, extend-ing drives, wearing down defenses and rarely 
settling for short field goals.
For much of the previous four seasons, the Gators were one of those teams, marching 
through their schedule with a short-yardage trump card in their pocket.
But with quarterback Tim Tebow gone, 
Florida is still searching for its most reliable 
option as a replacement, and the void could 
be seen clearly in last weekend’s loss at No. 1 Alabama.
“We felt good going into the Alabama game, 
and now we don’t feel good again,” UF coach 
Urban Meyer said.
Wake-up call
Meyer’s worries arose after watching the 
Gators cross the Crimson Tide’s 5-yard line 
three times and leave with just three points and two turnovers.
Despite running three plays from the 2-yard 
line and two from the 1, Florida couldn’t find the end zone. On its first drive, UF faced a sec-ond and goal from the 2 and turned to wildcat quarterback Trey Burton, who was fresh off a six-touchdown performance the week before.
But Burton’s two runs didn’t break through, 
and his fourth-down jump pass landed in en-emy hands for an interception. When a third-quarter drive ended with a  fumble from the 1-yard line, the Gators were left lamenting lost opportunities and looking for what let them down in the 31-6 loss.
“If you’re telling me a back has to get one 
yard, my question would be where his of-fensive line is,” left guard Carl Johnson said. 
“Shouldn’t they at least give him some kind 
of push? So it really shouldn’t matter. Even if we have [quarterback John Brantley] running it for a yard, we should be able to get one yard. We’re not asking for 13, we’re asking for one yard.”
But the Gators’ approach isn’t as straight-
forward as following the line’s lead.
This year Florida has run 16 plays when 
needing three or fewer yards to convert a third or fourth down, passing eight times. Seven dif-ferent players have touched the ball, and only half of those plays resulted in first downs.
That variety is a stark departure from the 
tried-and-true method the Gators had relied 
on since 2006.
Old Faithful
From his first carry as a freshman, it was 
clear Tebow would be a valuable asset.
That touch, a 1-yard touchdown run 
against Southern Miss, charted the course 
for a dominant short-yardage rushing ca-
reer.
Tebow’s number was called 23 times in 
short-yardage situations in 2006, and he de-
livered on 20 of them, converting his first 12 and scoring five touchdowns from inside the 3-yard line.
His production was so automatic that it 
was jarring when he failed.
Against Mississippi in 2008, Tebow con-
verted two fourth-and-1 opportunities but came up short on his third try, a run for no gain up the middle that sealed the Rebels’ upset and left the Heisman Trophy winner in tears.
He wasn’t used to stalling at the line, and 
he didn’t make a habit of it. Last season, Tebow converted 33 of his 41 short-yardage carries into first downs or touchdowns, scoring 10 times.
This year, UF has had 10 plays from the 
1- or 2-yard lines and scored on just four of them.
“Tim, he was a bigger guy, but he also — 
not saying the guys now don’t have determi-
nation — but Tim was always determined to 
get that one or two yards,” running back Jeff Demps said. “Not down-talking our guys — like I said, they have that determination too — but Tim’s was just a little bigger than 
those guys.”
Replacement needed
Demps heads the Gators’ rushing attack, 
but at 5-foot-8 and 190 pounds, he isn’t the 
ideal back for pounding runs inside.
At 215 pounds, redshirt senior Emmanuel 
Moody figured to be the best option head-
ing into the season, but his results haven’t 
matched those hopes. A five-yard run on fourth and 3 against USF is Moody’s lone short-yardage success, as he fumbled on fourth down in the season opener and has been stopped for no gain twice.
Meyer said sophomore Mike Gillislee has 
supplanted Moody, but Gillislee hasn’t had a short-yardage carry since a two-yard score 
against Tennessee on Sept. 18.
“If you’re going to hand it off, it’s going 
to be to Gilly first, Moody second, and the 
issue also is the improved blocking of our tight end,” Meyer said. “We’ve got to im-prove that area. It’s easy to say, ‘Get under center and run this play,’ but if you have a tight end who’s really never played tight end, we’re really not efficient at that posi-
tion.”
It’s up to quarterback-turned-tight-end 
Jordan Reed to fix that, and he could also 
get a chance to run it himself. Reed was the Gators’ wildcat quarterback before suffer -
ing a preseason hamstring injury that al-lowed Burton to assume the role.
Burton took the reigns with author -
ity, scoring five times from inside the 12-
yard line against Kentucky, but no one has 
emerged as the go-to option.
Several players were asked this week to 
choose a teammate they’d most trust to pick up a yard on fourth and 1, and none would single one out as the best.
When pressed on who he’d give the ball 
to in a similar situation on a video game, de-fensive tackle Omar Hunter came out with 
a new strategy.
“I’m going to sub myself in on offense,” 
said the 307-pound Hunter, who played 
some running back in high school. “I would love to do that.”
That would sit well with Johnson, who 
said he’s less concerned with who has the ball than how his line performs.
“If we can’t get a yard, that’s our fault,” 
Johnson said. “We have probably the big-gest offensive line and one of the best in the country. Why can’t we get one yard? Of course I put that weight on our shoulders. As a leader, don’t you want it that way?”
Meyer isn’t willing to place the blame on 
the line, though, saying at some point his skill players have to just make a play. 
“I don’t think the line played great, but 
it’s certainly not because they’re not getting a push,” Meyer said. “You can only push the amount of bodies you have. If there’s two extra bodies in there, then either the tail-back’s got to run over someone or you’ve got to throw the ball and make someone miss down there.” Editor Anthony Chiang    ◗  Cover Photo Harrison Diamond, Alexander Silva, and Matt Tripp

ing his four seasons at UF. Here’s a look at 
Tebow’s numbers when running from the 1- 
or 2-yard line and on third and fourth downs 
with three or fewer yards to go.2009: Converted 33 of 41 (10 TDs)

 It didn’t take long for the post-
Tebow era to hit its ﬁ  rst bump in the 
road.
  After No. 14 Florida’s (4-1, 2-1 
Southeastern Conference) loss to No. 1 
Alabama last week, the Gators’ season 
arrived at a fork in the road.
  UF will choose the path it takes Sat-
urday when it hosts No. 12 LSU (5-0, 
3-0 SEC) at 7:30 p.m. 
  The Gators last suffered a regular 
season loss on Sept. 27, 2008, against 
Ole Miss. Coach Urban Meyer’s team 
responded with 10 straight wins and 
an eventual national championship.
  But this team is different from the 
2008 squad, as freshmen make up 46 
percent of the roster. Still, the mental-
ity that it takes to rebound from a loss 
doesn’t change.
  “If we dwell on the past then we’ll 
let this one get right past us, too,” cen-ter Mike Pouncey said. “We need this game to keep hope alive for the SEC 
Championship game.”
  However, in order to turn that hope 
into reality UF will have to improve its 
offensive play. 
  After averaging 40.67 points per 
game in the past three seasons, the 
Gators are putting up just 31.4 points 
per contest this year.  Some of the problems stem from 
quarterback John Brantley, who has 
thrown for six touchdowns and three interceptions in ﬁ  ve games. 
  Brantley is averaging 6.22 yards per 
pass attempt, and his longest comple-
tion has gone for 30 yards. On the oth-
er hand, former UF quarterback Tim 
Tebow completed a pass of at least 40 yards in the previous three season openers.
  “There’s reason to evaluate that,” 
Meyer said. “I’m not sure we are will-
ing to [change our offensive style]. We 
have to play to the defense, and our job 
is to go and win the game. And if that 
means a much higher percentage of 
passing, then we’ll do that. If it means 
managing the game, then we’ll man-age the game.”
  Following Saturday’s meeting with 
the Tigers, the Gators will either be back on a path that leads to Atlanta or 
on one they haven’t taken since 2007, 
when UF ﬁ  nished with four losses. 
  But senior offensive lineman Carl 
Johnson believes Florida will ﬁ  nd its 
way.
  “History shows it,” he said. “Go all 
the way back to 2008 when we lost to 
Ole Miss, it was kind of like a Gators wake-up call. We picked it up and ral-lied behind Tebow. And we are going 
to do the same thing now and rally be-
hind Brantley.”  UF looks to bounce back as season hangs in balance
Coach: Les Miles
Players to Watch: RB Steven Ridley, DT Drake Nevis, MLB Kelvin Shep-
pard,CB Patrick Peterson
Prognosis : The Tigers enter this game riding a perfect season in record 
only. Poor clock management in the fourth quarter last week against lowly Tennessee appeared to cost LSU the 
game, but the Tigers were bailed out because 13 ’Vols played defense on the ﬁ  rst “last play of the game” — a 
botched snap that should have ﬁ  nalized the upset. Still, LSU is 5-0 because of one of the conference’s premier defenses, ranking ﬁ  rst in total yards (246.6 per game), ﬁ  rst in rushing (79 per game) and second in scoring (12.4 
per game). The Tigers also sport Ridley, the SEC’s leading rusher with 557 yards.SCOUTING REPORT
Florida Gators
Coach: Urban Meyer
Players to Watch: RB Jeff Demps, QB John Brantley, SS Ahmad Black, 
MLB Jon Bostic
Prognosis: Mounting fears about Florida were realized in its 31-6 shel-lacking last week at Alabama, the Gators’ worst loss since 2005. UF’s 
offense has been one of the most stagnant in the SEC this season, 
ranking ninth in total yards (339.8 per game), ninth in rushing (151 per game) and 10th in passing (188.8 per game). The Gators have lacked 
game breakers, meaning they’ll desperately need Demps, the team’s leading rusher, to play through with his sprained foot. But even with Demps this season, Florida has been carried by its defense. Led by Black (37 tackles, 3 INTs) and Bostic (23 tackles, 3 INTs), the Gators rank second in total defense (291 yards per game) 
and have the second-best turnover margin with plus-4. Saturday’s meeting will mark the third time in four 
weeks that the UF defense faces the conferences’ leading rusher. The other two backs (Tennessee’s Tauren Poole and Kentucky’s Derrick Locke) combined for 126 yards against the Florida defense.

More than 630 meals were served for free to Gainesville’s 
homeless Thursday morning as part of the 12th annual 
Breakfast on the Plaza and Homeless Services Fair.
The city’s homeless were encouraged to come out to the 
Bo Diddley Community Plaza for a free meal and access to any of the resources organized by the Alachua County Co-alition for the Homeless and Hungry. 
One of the event’s main organizers, Cheryl Twombly, 
spokeswoman for the department of children and families, said that 1,350 eggs were cracked to prepare the breakfast meals. 
Twombly said last year, about 430 meals were given out, 
but the number of people served Thursday was probably around 300. 
She explained that during an event like this, it’s all right 
for people to get back in line because that way they don’t 
have to worry about where the day’s next meal is going to 
come from. 
Bags filled with food and hygiene items were also hand-
ed out free of charge.
The event was funded entirely by donations. Those who attended the event were given access to about 
38 services including haircuts, legal counseling, pet food, 
bike repairs and replacement IDs.
The consensus among organizers was that the IDs were 
the most valuable service available. This is because having 
a valid photo ID is integral to getting other services to help lift people out of homelessness, said Earnest Graham, crime prevention officer for GPD. 
The most popular request Graham got was for bike locks. 
He said he handed out at least 200 at the fair.
Graham said they’re actually gun locks that were donat-
ed by the National Rifle Association as part of a program to prevent children from using guns in the household. Since there haven’t been many requests for gun safety sessions, 
the surplus locks are put use by homeless on bikes, tents and bins used to store food and personal possessions. 
Alachua County Commissioner Rodney Long served as 
the event’s speaker. He gave out awards to distinguished individuals and businesses that are helping the homeless in 
the community, such as Freddie Wehbe of Gator Domino’s. 
Gator Domino’s was one of the first to sign on to a new 
program that will allow the homeless to use their electronic 
Florida man denies cocaine found in his buttocks is his, but says weed is
BRADENTON, Fla.  — When sheriff’s dep-
uties allegedly discovered a bags of marijuana 
and cocaine between a man’s buttocks, they said he gave a quick explanation. Manatee County deputies said Raymond Stanley Rob-erts told them “The white stuff is not mine, but the weed is.”
Deputies stopped the 25-year-old Wednes-
day in Bradenton for speeding. Officers said they smelled marijuana and searched him. That’s when they allegedly found a bag of marijuana between Roberts’ buttocks.
Officers then discovered another bag in 
there; the report said it contained 27 pieces of rock cocaine.
The Bradenton Herald reported Roberts 
was arrested for drug possession and has bonded out of jail. The person who answered Friday at a phone number listed for Roberts said it wasn’t his.

About 35 people in white T-shirts gath-
ered on the Plaza of Americas on Thurs-
day evening to protest the nine-year an-
niversary of the United States’ invasion of 
Afghanistan. 
The rally was led by the UF chapter of Students for a Democratic Society.
The event featured eight speakers who 
spoke about a variety of topics: from the 
plight of women in Afghanistan, to facism 
in America, to the U.S. presence in South Korea. 
In addition to holding the rally, SDS set 
up an informational table in the Plaza of 
the Americas all week.
They asked students to wear white T-shirts for peace, said Jose Soto, an SDS or -
ganizer. 
“Our goal is to get as 
many people to partici-
pate as possible,” said Dave Schneider, another SDS organizer. “Even if 
it’s a small step like put-ting on white T-shirts.”
For about an hour, 
speakers exchanged the megaphone and 
stood on a bench in the middle of the field, where they made their case against the on-
going war in Afghanistan. 
Some of the speakers said they were 
disappointed with the turnout. 
Cassia Laham, president of Students 
for Justice in Palestine, was one of those. She told the crowd that students need to 
get active and spread the word to improve 
turnouts. 
However, Schneider said he wasn’t dis-
appointed with the turnout at Thursday’s Student protestors speak out against Afghan war

UF faculty received $7 million 
in government funding that will

Four faculty members in the 
UF College of Dentistry received grants to enhance dentistry train-
ing and improve dental care ac-cess for people in need. 
The Health Resources and Ser -
vices Administration awarded UF 
five of the six grants applied for, ranging from $300,000 to $3.7 mil-
lion.
One of the award recipients is 
Dr. Frank Catalanotto, chairman of community dentistry and be-
havioral sciences.
Catalanotto received two of the 
five grants, which will be used to enhance the dental program’s cur -
riculum and provide new equip-ment and technology, such as la-sers and dental chairs. 
“The purpose is to help en-
hance students’ education and get patients some of the newest 
and best care,” he said.
The recipients 
of the other three 
grants are Dr. Teresa Dolan, dean of the College of Dentistry; Dr. 
Scott Tomar, professor of com-
munity dentistry and behavioral sciences; and Dr. Micaela Gibbs, assistant professor of community dentistry and behavioral sciences. 
Plans for the funds include a 
teaching grant that will employ two new faculty members to edu-
cate students on ways to commu-
nicate with patients, especially minorities and those with diverse 
backgrounds, Catalanotto said. 
The money will also help ex-
pand educational efforts on the risks of chewing tobacco and oth-
er tobacco products, he said. 
In addition to new curricula, the grants will help fund the Sum-mer of Learning program hosted 
by the college. Minority students 
from various colleges around Florida are chosen to participate 
in a four- to five-week program 
encouraging a future in the dental profession. The grants, as well as 
the College of Dentistry, will cov-
er the expenses of the program.
“We have a very important 
goal – to increase the number of minority dentists,” Catalanotto said.$7-million grant will improve dental care for needy

The free event will offer food and a talent showcase 
with organizations on campus competing to be Best in Show.The Staff’s members are excited to debut their new 
song that they said is a chart-topping rap single.  
“This year’s performance is going to embody the mean-
ing of ‘swag,’” said Jabari Taylor, group performance di-rector. 
The group went through a vigorous tryout session this 
year because Soulfest will be filmed and aired at a later time on WUFT-TV Channel 5. 
The Staff began in 2008 with only two members and 
has since increased to 18 members.
The group has performed for multiple events includ-
ing Talent Night for Gator Growl, where it placed second; International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella; and SoJam, an annual collegiate a cappella music festival

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A 
proposal to loosen Florida’s class 
size limits survived a challenge from 
the statewide teachers union Thurs-
day when the state Supreme Court approved the measure’s ballot sum-mary.
The unanimous ruling came a 
day after the justices heard oral ar -
gument on whether to permit the counting of votes on the proposed state constitutional amendment. It would have been too late to remove it from the Nov . 2 ballot, where it will need at least 60 percent to pass.
The court ruled the ballot sum-
mary accurately describes what the Legislature’s proposal would do.
The Florida Education Associa-tion argued the summary is mislead-ing because it fails to say the amend-ment would reduce state funding 
schools now get for such class size 
expenses as adding teachers and classrooms.
The justices, though, said that’s obvious even if it’s not spelled out.
“We note that a voter would be 
able to draw a commonsense con-clusion from a review of the ballot summary that the amount of fund-ing needed to sufficiently fund revised class sizes will likely be re-
duced,” the high court wrote in the 
unsigned opinion.State court rejects challenge to class-size amendment� BOB’S RIVER PLACE WILL HOST.

Students who want to help provide re-
lief for the victims of the recent devastating 
floods in Pakistan can do so by enjoying a 
day at Bob’s River Place on the Suwannee River this Sunday . 
Gators for UNICEF, a student-run chapter 
of the  organization that provides help for 
children and mothers in developing or disas-
ter-ridden countries, will host the fundraiser at Bob’s. This  will be the first event for the group that was founded this summer.
On Oct. 10, UNICEF will provide aid to 
10 million children affected by the floods in Pakistan. 
“We were really frustrated with how 
the media in the United States haven’t been 
publicizing the floods at all, even though 
it affected more people than the (Indone-sian) tsunami, Haitian earthquake and the Pakistan earthquake combined,” said Laura 
Morris, president and founder of Gators for 
UNICEF.According to UN reports, the floods, 
which occurred between July and August, have caused injury or homelessness for al-
most 21 million people. 
“The money that we raise will go direct-
ly towards the UNICEF team in Pakistan,” 
Morris said.
The event will be held from noon to 7 
p.m. There will be numerous attractions, including water slides, river rafts and rope swings. Admission is $15 per car, and a bar -
becue cookout will be available for a dona-tion of $5. 
“I think that since UF is such a big com-
munity, we could potentially get the whole 
Gainesville community together, raise a lot 
of money for UNICEF and make a differ -
ence,” Morris said.Fundraiser helps UNICEF

It’s been more than a year since her 
mission trip, but Ciara Rodgers still 
can’t forget the little boy she saw run-
ning through the streets of the Domini-can Republic.
Rodgers was shocked by how few 
possessions the boy had. Compared to children in the U.S., his life was any-thing but normal. 
Rodgers, the Florida Invitational Step 
Show executive assistant, heard about 
Operation Christmas Child and saw the 
project as a way to give back to millions of children like the one she saw.
Starting today from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., 
and every Friday until Nov. 12, students 
can stop by Turlington Plaza to donate 
shoeboxes or small plastic containers filled with gifts. 
Once the boxes and donations are 
collected, FISS will drop them off at a lo-
cal church. They will then be passed to 
a national center before being shipped throughout the world.
Florida Invitational Step Show is also 
looking for monetary donations from 
students because each box costs $7 to send. The orga-nization hopes to collect 
between 150 and 200 com-
plete boxes in Turlington, 
Rodgers said.
“Making a difference for kids that 
are so grateful for the little things makes 
it all worthwhile,” she said. “Something 
so simple as taking a couple minutes out of your day can make a world of differ -
ence to a child who doesn’t have any-
thing.”Step show assistant

Today’s question: Would the Naked Cowboy make a good president?
197 TOTAL VOTES77% YES23% NOThursday’s question: Should the animals at SeaWorld be set free?Is it just us or is it the time of the year when everything just 
seems to become a race to the finish? It’s the time of the year when professors forget we have more than one class, 
and it feels like we’re taking 27 credits instead of a measly 12. It’s the time of the year when we can almost feel the win-ter holidays, and we start thinking about making those ring chains where we tear a ring off every day as we get closer to 
the finish (winter break). 
Seriously, we realize it’s barely October, but we’re already 
getting ready with our glue sticks and wild-and-crazy scissors 
to cut the construction paper and decorate our living rooms with a seemingly endless chain of malformed rings. 
We hope you’re feeling this way, too. Because we’re ex-
hausted. 
But we won’t let you down! We know how much all of you 
look forward to Friday and this little weekly recap, so with-
out further ado, the Department of Darts and Laurels presents 
you with our We-Still-Don’t-Understand-What-Eggnog-Has-To-Do-With-The-Holidays-But-We-Just-Can’t-Wait-Until-It’s-Here-Again-Because-That-Means-Santa-Or-Hanukkah-Har -

Darts & Laurels
And there are a few other things that happened this week 
that make us wish for the near future besides images of candy 
canes and sugarplums (does anybody even know what the 
hell a sugarplum is?). 
The Naked Cowboy, aka Robert Burck, aka the brief-sport-
ing, cowboy-hat-wearing, guitar-slinging Time Square croon-
er, announced Wednesday he’s running for president in 2012 
as a member of the tea party movement.
We’re not ones who think the best thing for America right 
now is chai with a side of big business, but with the expanding 
slew of GOP potentials (see: Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, etc.) perhaps what our country needs right now is a little tighty-
whitey action in the Oval Office. 
America hasn’t gotten this steamy since that risqué picture 
of a buff Barack emerged. 
So, Naked Cowboy, we’re covering you up with a We-Al-
so-Prefer-Briefs LAUREL. 
Because, really, how much worse could things get?
Apparently, SeaWorld shouldn’t ask that question. Because 
if the Orlando-based marine monstrosity thought the poop deck was clean, think again. 
After the company’s third whale in the last four months 
died this week, making the 25-year-old female the company’s 13th in the past 14 years (not including the handful of employ-ee deaths at the hands of these marine mammals), SeaWorld 
should really just sit in the corner. 
For clearly not knowing what’s in the best interest of its 
animals and not even attempting to train its animals to live 
in the wild where they belong, we’re playfully dunking the amusement company under the water and throwing Sea-
World a Weren’t-You-Guys-Even-A-Little-Bit-Touched-By-“Free Willy” DART. 
But Gainesville is a bit touched by a very special performer 
rocking the city out tonight. 
Bob Dylan, to you, one of rock ‘n’ roll’s most-famed mu-
sicians, we’re glad you came back to Gainesville. And to re-member you, because let’s face it, many of us will never see you alive again, we’re smoking you out with a Sloop-John-B LAUREL.
No school next Friday, but we’ll see you at the parade with 
our next edition of  Darts & Laurels.Parenting the root of intolerance, evil
So maybe it’s time to address the pink elephant in the column. I know readers have speculated, and, yes, my last name is Italian. 
Not only is my last name Italian, but I’m also gay. I 
know this might seem like a shocking revelation from a kid who loves unicorns, but bear with me through this ar -
ticle and you might learn something.  
It seems during the last few weeks being gay in the 
United States has become dangerous. Three suicides have received media attention and, therefore, created various debates on the issues of suicides and bullying. 
Meeting someone who is gay is becoming more and 
more like playing 20 questions, and recently I participated in such a game. While discussing the suicides with a group of my friends, a mutual friend approached the conversa-tion and gave his two cents. 
Now I usually throw away pennies, but in this 
case I chose to listen before disregarding his opinion.  
His first statement, regarding the student at Rutgers whose roommate installed a camera in their dorm room to video-tape him making out with another man, was typical.
“Well, if he is going to engage in that sort of be-
havior you should expect people to laugh at you.” Yes, having a tough skin is without a doubt the best acces-sory any gay person can have, but in this case diamond 
skin wouldn’t be enough to keep the humiliation from 
seeping in. 
If someone recorded your most intimate moments 
without your consent and posted it online for the world to mock, I’m sure you wouldn’t be too happy about that. 
After explaining this to our friend, he came at us with my 
all-time favorite gay insult.
“Well, he chose to be gay.”Probably the most-asked 
question by straight guys is when we chose to be gay. 
A question to which I always 
reply by asking the person to give the time, place and exact date 
he chose a life of straightness.  
At this point he begins getting 
upset and resorts to his last de-
fense.
“Well, I don’t agree with what he did because he was 
gay.”
The conversation regarding suicide became an issue of 
sexuality when it should have been one of compassion. 
Bullying is wrong no matter the situation, no matter 
the sexuality. Yes, suicide is wrong. No one in this world should be worth your life. 
But shouldn’t we be less concerned about their sexuality 
and more about the way children are attacking each other? 
It’s not like they are learning about gay-bashing from Ses-
ame Street. The problem is parenting. I guess the reces-sion has had such an effect on the American population that even the Golden Rule has been sold to Gold 4 Cash.  
So instead of repeating something that has been easily for-
gotten, I’ll put a twist on a pop culture quotation. 
Calling someone fat won’t make you any skinnier. 
Calling someone gay won’t make you any straighter. 
Ruining someone’s life won’t make yours any better.  
Just in case you read this and still didn’t learn anything, just remember a group of unicorns is called a blessing. 
See you learn something new every day.Hassan Casanova is a third-year family, youth and commu-
nity science student. His column appears every Friday.

Animals not ours to exploit for enter -
tainment
The Editorial Board could not be more 
spot-on: Orcas do not belong in tanks for 
their entire lives any more than humans be-long in bathtubs for their entire lives.
SeaWorld, which owns most of the cap-
tive orcas and bottlenose dolphins in the U.S., has a long history of poor animal care. Twenty-one orcas died in U.S. SeaWorld facilities between 1986 and 2008 – an aver -
age of nearly one a year for 22 years. They died of severe trauma, intestinal gangrene, acute hemorrhagic pneumonia, pulmonary abscesses, chronic kidney disease, chronic cardiovascular failure, septicemia, influ-
enza, etc. 
In some cases, the cause of death could 
not be  determined, but it is clear none of these animals, who live 60 to 80 years in the 
wild, died of old age. The USDA has repeat-edly cited SeaWorld facilities for failing to comply with the minimal requirements of the federal Animal Welfare Act, which is the bare minimum for keeping  animals 
alive, much less emotionally content.
The solution to this problem is simple: 
Seek forms of entertainment that do not re-
quire the imprisonment of animals. 
Such places only malign our relation-
ship with the natural world, and they teach our children that animals exist to perform strange and unnatural tricks for our amuse-ment.

Free Tilly?
No. 
One, he was never free. Whales born in captivity are the ones we 
typically see in shows and they are there to promote awareness of the need for wild 
animals to stay wild and the safety of those 
animals. 
SeaWorld, as a company, does a lot of 
rescue, rehabilitation and release work with sea life from our local manatees to killer 
whales. 
While the deaths of those individuals 
is disheartening, one must remember the 
death in ‘99 was the result of a break-in and 
the man was found too late. Yes, Tilikum is huge, and trainers tend 
to stay out of the tank with him because he, like most killer whales, is intelligent enough 
to know we don’t belong in the water.  
But SeaWorld does a lot of good, and it 
has very strict safety rules, and people get 
hurt when they break those rules.
Personally, I don’t think animals should 
be captive, but I am not naive enough to 
think it’s not necessary sometimes.
The death of another animal is only 
more proof we need more information on 
the care of these animals. 
You can’t run around releasing captive- 
bred and captive-fed animals and expect them to survive.

Don’t ask me if I’m registered to vote. Don’t ask me who 
I’m voting for. Don’t ask me where I stand on health care. 
No one cares. What passes for interest in the political pro-
cess these days is far from what the supposedly fanatical, 
religious, bigoted, old white men had in mind when they il-
legally started this country. 
I know who my congressman is. I know what posi-
tions are being voted on in November. And I know why I’m dissatisfied with the current presidency. That alone makes me, by most people’s standards, “politically active,” which illustrates the farce that is modern political science.  
Recently, my friend told me she was registered to vote.
 I asked her who she was voting for, to which she replied it 
wasn’t a presidential election, so what would she vote on?
I should have been disgusted. I should have been consumed 
with righteous indignation. But I wasn’t. I can’t blame her. It’s not like the candidates we have for any position are at all inspiring.  
After all, our system is efficient at weeding out true ideo-logues. Politicians’ forced compromises and concessions turn our leaders into bland TV personalities who propagate on their own cable channel. Like QVC, 
our politicians are so flat and boring they’ve been relegated to 
their own channel because they can’t garner interest in their 
monotonous salesmanship, reminiscent of catatonic used-car dealers. 
Our politicians sell us something we probably won’t like in 
a few years for a price that could easily be considered extortion.  
Even more ridiculous than real politics is the microcosm that is Student Government elections. 
I haven’t spoken to anyone who believes in SG’s purpose 
or capabilities. That’s not to say these people don’t exist, I’m 
sure there’s a contingent out there that appreciates the differ -
ence SG makes at UF, and hopefully this contingent includes 
the SG candidates. These people, however, are probably too dumb or naive to realize the inanity of the popularity contest that we call an election. The Greek community, for whatever reason, is the most involved and, therefore, should be repre-sented the most. 
What this means, though, is Greek allegiance runs stron-
ger than community obligation and, ultimately, national duty.  
The greatest argument against democracy, according to Winston 
Churchill, is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.  
Conservatives complain the average American knows more 
about who gets voted off “Dancing with the Stars” (Hassel-hoff, I pine for thee) than who Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi is.  
I see late-night entertainers illustrating the public’s greater in-terest in “The Real World” than elections.
Who can blame them? It’s a sad predicament we’re in 
when the faux drama of reality TV is more convincing than the sincerity of our political leaders.
So, the next time you start feeling superior because you 
know what the House Ways and Means Committee votes on, stop. Until we have some real statesmen and women to vote for, there’s no point.

� COCKTAIL PARTY WILL 
BENEFIT CHARITIES SHE WORKED WITH.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Nearly two years have passed 
since Gator alumna Jordan Evert 
McCracken died, but her work to benefit the community continues to affect people.
Evert’s brother Jamison Evert 
said that in an effort to honor her, friends and family will hold a fund-
raising cocktail party titled “An 
Orange and Blue Affair,” to raise money for Guardian ad Litem and 
for Gainesville families in need. 
Guardian ad Litem is a national 
organization of volunteers who rep-
resent neglected and abused chil-dren in court. 
“My sister always loved to get 
people together, and she always believed in charity ,” Jamison said. “We thought this was a good event 
to carry on her legacy.”
Jordan, who died of a brain hem-
orrhage in December 2008, attended 
UF as an undergraduate and earned her graduate degree from UF’s Levin College of Law. She  belonged to Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and was a guardian for Guardian ad Litem.
“She was more of a friend to these 
kids,” Jamison said of the work his sister did as a guardian. 
He recalled an instance while 
he attended UF as an undergradu-ate and Jordan was still in the law school. He said the two shared a car and one day he came home to find the car missing from his driveway . At first, he was annoyed because she had not asked, but later in the day , when he was running errands around town, he saw his car with Jordan inside, along with a couple of 
children she was a guardian to.
“She had spent the afternoon tak-
ing them to school, to the doctor and 
buying them dinner,” Jamison said. ”She did a lot of these things and never really got any recognition for it.”
Aside from her dedication to 
school and to the children, she was 
also someone who loved to bring 
people together.
“She really left an impression on 
everyone that she was a good time,” said Tina Pozzi, Jordan’s best friend and sorority sister. 
Jordan was the social chair of her 
sorority and had a large and diverse group of friends. 
“I think she would think of (An 
Orange and Blue Affair) as the per -
fect tribute,” Pozzi said. “It com-bines the two things she really cared about: a good party with friends and a cause she really believed in and 
dedicated a lot of time to.”
The event will begin at 7 p.m. 
at The Bank Bar & Lounge in 
Gainesville.  It will include a silent auction and a champagne toast to Jordan. So far about $3,000 have been raised. The event is open to the public, and tickets are $35.

SCRANTON, Pa. — After beating and kicking an 
illegal Mexican immigrant and leaving him for dead 
in the street, a group of white teens in a small Penn-sylvania mining town knew they had a serious prob-lem on their hands.
So, witnesses said, they decided on a cover story 
to tell the police: They weren’t drinking. They didn’t utter ethnic slurs. 
And, above all, Brandon Piekarsky did not kick 
Luis Ramirez in the head as he lay unconscious in the street.
At the federal trial of Piekarsky and a co-defendant, 
witnesses described a plot Thursday that prosecutors say was designed to minimize the teens’ involvement in the fatal attack in Shenandoah, a town riven by eth-nic tensions between whites and a burgeoning His-panic population.
Piekarsky, now 18, and Derrick Donchak, now 20, 
are charged with a federal hate crime in the July 2008 assault by a tight-knit bunch of white athletes. 
Prosecutors allege Piekarsky kicked Ramirez in 
the head, while Donchak is accused of plotting with Shenandoah police to obstruct an investigation by the FBI.
“We were going to say that nobody kicked him, 
we weren’t drinking, and there were no racial slurs,” testified Ben Lawson, a former football player who witnessed the attack and then, he said, lied to police about it.
The fight began late July 12, 2008, when a half-doz-
en drunk teens, all Shenandoah residents who played football at Shenandoah Valley High School, were walking home from a block party and came across Ramirez and his 15-year-old girlfriend in a park.
Brian Scully, who has already pleaded guilty in 
juvenile court to aggravated assault, ethnic intimida-tion and other offenses for his role in the attack, testi-fied Thursday that he asked the girl, “Isn’t it a little too late to be out?”
That enraged Ramirez, who began yelling in Span-
ish and dialing friends on his cell phone.
“I didn’t understand him,” Scully said. “So I didn’t 
like it.”Witnesses give

TUPELO, Miss. — When a Mississip-
pi judge entered a courtroom and asked 
everyone to stand for the Pledge of Al-legiance, an attorney with a reputation for fighting free speech battles stayed si-lent as everyone else recited the patriotic oath. The lawyer was jailed.
Attorney Danny Lampley spent 
about five hours behind bars Wednes-day before Judge Talmadge Littlejohn set him free so that the lawyer could work on another case. 
Lampley told The Northeast Mis-
sissippi Daily Journal he respected the judge but wasn’t going to back down.
“I don’t have to say it because I’m an 
American,” Lampley told the newspa-per.
The Supreme Court ruled nearly 70 
years ago that schoolchildren couldn’t be forced to say the pledge, a decision widely interpreted to mean no one could be required to recite the pledge.
On Thursday, the judge again asked 
those in the courtroom to pledge alle-giance to the flag, which stands to the right of the bench.
“I didn’t expect the Pledge of Al-
legiance, but he asked me to do it so I did it,” said Melissa Adams, 41, who testified in a child custody case that was 
closed to the public.
Lampley, 49, previ-
ously refused to say the pledge in front of Lit-
tlejohn in June. He was asked to leave the courtroom, but returned after the pledge.
The attorney told the newspaper 
Wednesday it was a problem for the judge and himself to work out, yet blogs across the country lit up with fiery com-ments and support for both sides.
And in the small town of Tupelo, the birthplace of Elvis with a population of 
about 35,000, some were infuriated by 
Lampley’s silence.
“I thought he was a disgrace to the 
United States,” Bobby Martin, a 43-year-old self-employed maintenance worker, said of Lampley. “If he can’t say that in front of a judge, he don’t deserve to be here” in this country.
Others voiced support for the attor -
ney.
“I’m speechless. The judge needs 
a reminder copy of the First Amend-ment,” said Judith Schaeffer, a Washing-ton attorney who, along with Lampley, successfully sued the Pontotoc school district in northern Mississippi in the 1990s to stop students from praying over the intercom.
Lampley also was victorious repre-
senting a Ku Klux Klan leader when a county in the Mississippi Delta tried to prevent a rally.
“Danny’s going to stand up for ev-
erybody’s principles,” she said.

� HE COULD BE DEPORTED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — A man who took five 
French tourists on a police chase in an illegal 
airport shuttle van pleaded guilty Thursday to felony assault in exchange for a 90-day jail term.
Ian McFarlane could’ve faced seven years 
in prison had he been convicted at trial. Mc-Farlane, who is not a U.S. citizen, could be deported to his native Jamaica after he serves his sentence.
Neither he nor his attorney spoke publicly afterward.
McFarlane and driver Khaalif Preacher di-
rected the tourists to their unlicensed van as they looked for transportation to Manhattan outside Kennedy Airport in June 2009.
A plainclothes officer, who said he recog-
nized McFarlane from previous arrests for corralling passengers into unlicensed ve-hicles, tried to stop the van from pulling off by reaching into the van and grabbing for the keys. The officer was injured as Preacher sped away, prosecutors said. McFarlane was sitting in the front seat.
Port Authority of New York and New Jer -
sey police chased the van, which snaked for about seven miles through residential streets and struck a gate, a truck and a stop sign near a U.S. Postal Service facility in Brooklyn.
Police arrested the men shortly after they 
tried to jump out of the van while it was still moving.
One tourist, Claudie Mamane, also tried to 
jump from the moving van, injuring her arm. The other passengers — Mamane’s daughter, another couple and 
their daughter — were not injured. The fami-lies had taken the same flight from Paris.
New York City officials showered them

Preacher pleaded guilty in October 2009 to 
felony reckless endangerment. His sentenc-ing is scheduled for Jan. 11 and McFarlane’s for Jan. 12.
Months after the chase, a new state law in-
creased penalties for unlicensed taxi drivers to a maximum of 90 days in jail and fines as high as $1,250. Previously, violations usually resulted in the equivalent of a traffic ticket.
Last November, around the start of the 
holiday travel season, police arrested 18 driv-ers at Kennedy and LaGuardia airports dur -
ing an enforcement sweep to crack down on unlicensed taxi drivers.

“It’s so hard to organize around this 
issue right now in the U.S.,” Schneider 
said. “This is a war with no end in sight.” 
Schneider said next year he wants 
to work with other organizations. That, 
he  said, might help to make a larger im-
pact. 
“Our hope is to build up toward a 
bigger movement,” Schneider said. “Es-pecially for the 10th anniversary next 
year.”
At the rally, students stood in a half-
circle holding various signs reading 
“Peace in the Middle East,” “SDS stands 
against war,” “Troops out now” and one 
in Spanish that translated to “Enough with the war!”
The organizers also distributed infor -
mational fliers.Some of the fliers shared statistics 
about public opinion and war, includ-
ing an Associated Press poll, performed 
in August, that showed 60 percent of Americans were opposed to the war in Afghanistan.
“We support our troops,” Soto said in 
reference to the Associated Press opinion poll. 
Soto added, “That’s why we advocate 
bringing them back. We don’t want to see our Gators going off and fighting and coming back in a wheelchair.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 11

A pair of donated bikes were also raffled 
off to the homeless attendees.
In an interview, Long said that at events 
such as this, food may be the attraction, but 
that the services provided are the true ben-efit. 
Often, homeless people don’t have the 
means to seek out each individual service, so it’s easier to present them to them, Long said.  The event gave an update on the 10-
Year Plan to End Homelessness Program.  
The situation for Gainesville’s homeless is better than it was five years ago, but it will continue to be a problem until housing is available, Long said. 
Dan Kahn, case coordinator for the home-less social security program at Three Rivers Legal Services, said the fair gives him an op-portunity to see what the community can of-
fer so he, in turn, can provide better advice 
to his clients.
However, Ellen Allen, 
founder of the Good Neighbor Society, a group that goes into 
poor areas and tries to help 
people directly, said she found the event 
wasn’t as helpful as it could be. “For the day, it helps,” she said. “The 
people who work for the bureaucracy don’t have a clue what it’s like to be poor or home-
less.”
Allen said the main problem is that there 
isn’t enough housing for the homeless. 
Commissioner Long echoed her senti-
ment, saying it’s difficult to fight for an is-sue where people don’t feel like spending 
money gets them results.
“It’s a hard battle,” Long said.HOMELESS , from page 1“That’s why we advocate bring-

Messy Mascots
The statue of UF mascots Albert and Alberta stands outside the Emerson Alumni Hall, 
marred by graffiti that was scrawled by an apparent rival fan Thursday. The vandal or van -

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MONTPELIER, Vt. — The 
state auditor got popped for 
drunk driving. A candidate for 
secretary of state fell asleep at the wheel and drove into a ditch. A candidate for governor was cited 
for speeding, and two troopers 
got in trouble for allegedly trying 
to fix the ticket.
Welcome to the campaign trail 
in Vermont, where the candi-
dates’ behind-the-wheel mishaps 
are hot topics in the run-up to the 
Nov. 2 elections.
Roads scholars, they’re not:Jason Gibbs, a Republican 
running for secretary of state, 
crashed his car into a ditch Sept. 
17 after nodding off on his way home from a day of campaigning. No one was hurt. He paid a $214 
fine for failing to stay in his lane.
Democrat Peter Shumlin, 
who’s running for governor, was 
cited for driving 81 miles per hour June 17 and paid a $152 fine. Two Vermont State Police 
troopers who tried to void the ticket acted unacceptably and are 
under investigation, according to 
state Public Safety Commissioner Thomas Tremblay.
 Meanwhile, a lawsuit has 
been filed against the state for 
releasing dash-
board video of Shumlin’s road-
side stop but not 
the 2009 stop 
that led to state Auditor Tom Salmon’s drunk 
driving arrest.
Salmon, a Republican running 
for re-election, had a .086 blood-
alcohol content when he was pulled over in 2009 for failing 
to use a turn signal. He pleaded 
guilty to driving drunk and paid 
a $500 fine. His Democratic oppo-nent in this year’s election hasn’t used it against him, though, writ-ing it off to bad judgment on one night.Navigating campaign 
trail proves hard in Vermont this electionNATIONAL THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MANCHESTER, Mo. — St. Louis Coun-
ty highway officials are crediting a 6-year-
old boy with giving them some direction on making their road signs more accurate.
KTVI-TV says first-grader David Hin-
des apparently noticed that a sign in the St. 
Louis suburb of Manchester told motorists 
that a single curve was ahead rather than the multiple twists and turns that actually unfold.
The boy repeatedly com-
plained to his parents about the discrepancy until his dad 
suggested he take action.
 The boy wrote a letter to highway ad-
ministrators who called him the next day to tell him he’s right.
The sign has since been updated.
His attentiveness — and persistence — 
won him a tour of the county shop where signs are made.
David Hindes’ mom says he was so hap-
py, it was as if he had visited Santa’s work-shop.Six-year-old boy credited with correcting road signs

 ZAPATA, Texas — A search 
for a missing American tourist 
presumably shot and killed by Mexican pirates on a border lake 
has been thwarted by threats of an 
ambush from drug gangs, U.S. of-ﬁ  cials said Thursday.
  U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar told 
reporters that Mexican authorities are doing everything they can to ﬁ  nd David Hartley’s body while trying to keep their own crews safe.
  “When darkness was falling 
(Wednesday evening), they got word that there might be an am-bush,” Cuellar said. “People that are trying to do their job on the Mexican side are facing a risk, they’re right inside the hornets’ nest ... they had to suspend the search.”
  Cuellar said the search re-
sumed midmorning Thursday.
  Tiffany Hartley said her hus-
band, David, was shot to death by Mexican pirates chasing them on speedboats across Falcon Lake on Sept. 30 as they returned on Jet Skis from a trip to photograph a historic Mexican church. Neither 
his body nor the Jet Ski has been 
recovered. Texas ofﬁ  cials have warned boaters and ﬁ  sherman that pirates frequent the Mexi-can side of the lake, a 25-mile by 3-mile dammed section of the Rio Grande.  That part of Tamaulipas state 
is overrun by violence from a turf battle between the Gulf Cartel 
and the Zeta drug gang, made up 
of former Mexican special forces soldiers, and both are battling the Mexican military.
  Texas Gov. Rick Perry, cam-
paigning for re-election in Hous-ton, said such threats were no excuse.
  “I don’t think we’re doing 
enough. When you call off the search the way they did ... and give as the reason because the drug cartels are in control of that part of the state, something’s not right,” Perry said. “We do not need to let our border continue to deteriorate from the standpoint of having drug cartels telling wheth-
er or not we can go in and bring 
the body of an American citizen who was killed. That is irrespon-sible.”
  Later Thursday, Jesus de la 
Garza, deputy attorney general, said Mexican authorities have in-tensiﬁ  ed the search under orders from Tamaulipas Gov. Eugenio 
Hernandez, whose ofﬁ  ce had been 
contacted by a member of Perry’s staff.
  He said more than 100 people 
were searching for the body using speedboats, helicopters and all-terrain vehicles. Divers have also been deployed, he said.
  The lake appeared calm on 
Thursday afternoon. From the border markers in the water, the only sign of activity on the Mexi-can side was a single helicopter, which appeared to be a Mexican military aircraft, ﬂ  ying overhead.
  Zapata County Sheriff Sigi-
fredo Gonzalez said he has sent word to the Zetas that he wants 
the body returned and has no 
plans to prosecute.
  “We just want a body,” Gon-
zalez said. “We cannot arrest any-body for what happened in Mex-ico, we cannot prosecute on the state level anybody for what hap-pened in Mexico. We just want a body. I did send word to the drug 
cartel, the Zeta cartel in Mexico, I 
sent word to them unofﬁ  cially. I can’t tell you how but I sent word to them.”
  Gonzalez said he has not re-
ceived a response.
  Cuellar, a Texas Democrat 
joined by two other area congress-men, said Mexico was “doing the 
best that they can.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 13

UF fullback Steven Wilks missed the first five games of the season with a 
back injury. But he will play against LSU.
uF FOOTBALL
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Florida coach Urban Meyer said fullback Steven Wilks 
(back) is ready to suit up for the first time this season.
Sophomore T.J. Pridemore has filled that role in every 
game this season, but Meyer said Wilks has performed 
great in his first week of practice and reminds him of former Gator Billy Latsko.
“That’s good news for us,” Meyer said. “He’s just 
one of those football position guys and [a] very smooth player. He’s not a home-run hitter or anything like that, but he’s a guy that gets in your way and blocks you and knows the offense real well.”
Wilks appeared in six games last season. Demps still limited: Running back Jeff Demps has 
yet to practice at full speed this week, but Meyer still thinks the junior will play in Saturday’s game against LSU.
“We expect him to be at the same tempo he was last 
week against Alabama,” Meyer said.
Demps (sprained foot) was limited in practice last 
week as well, and his performance sagged against the Crimson Tide. The tailback carried the ball 11 times for 47 yards, and he did not catch any passes or return 
kicks.
In Florida’s first four games, Demps averaged 172 to-
tal yards on 18 touches.
Brantley struggles to pass: Quarterback John Brant-
ley (ribs) has not missed a practice this week despite 
feeling sore. What he wasn’t doing early this week, however, was toss passes.
“He was limited throwing,” Meyer said. “We would Wilks cleared to play after back injury
I know you want him back.
You miss watching him hop around 
in The Swamp pumping up the crowd. 
You miss him plowing through defensive 
lines and side-stepping linebackers before unleashing a bomb down the field.
But to borrow a line from noted basketball 
coach and Italian restaurant love-maker Rick Pitino: “Tim Tebow is not walking through that door.”
Not even wearing Trey Burton’s No. 8 
jersey.
TV commentators miss Tebow almost as 
much as you do. He provided endless high-lights and fodder for discussion, and they’re 
eager to fill the void.
After Burton went off for six touchdowns against Kentucky two 
weeks ago, those peo-
ple saw a chance to 
choose a new Chosen One. They anointed Burton, a freshman 
wildcat quarterback/
tight end/receiver/fullback, the man for the job. 
But he isn’t. No one 
is.
There won’t be another Tebow at Florida. 
There won’t be another Percy Harvin, either. And anyone who gets labeled as such is hav-
ing unfair pressure heaped on top of an al-
ready pressure-packed job.Andre Debose got the “next Harvin” tag 
before he graduated from high school, and 
more than a year after he arrived on campus, 
he’s struggling to meet those lofty expecta-tions. 
The hype was too much for Debose, but 
that isn’t stopping people from making the same mistake with Burton.
Here’s what it took for the Burton-Tebow 
comparison to be made:
1. Burton is playing as a running quar -
terback in his freshman season. Hey, Tebow did that!
2. Burton looks excited when he scores 
touchdowns. So did Tim!
3. Burton loves Jesus. No way! This kid’s Despite rumors, Tebow does not wear Burton pajamas

urban Meyer
UF football coachWhat’s the fastest way to piss off al-
ligatorSports readers?
Blaspheme against Tim Tebow? Call 
for the firing of Billy Donovan and Ur -
ban Meyer? Or maybe openly pick an-
other SEC team to win the conference?
We’re not going to do any of those 
things here at the alligatorSports Brand 
Picks Column, but we are going to de-bate the one game in which there truly are no winners in the eyes of the aver -
age Gators fan. 
FSU against Miami.This once-proud rivalry game hasn’t 
mattered for the better part of the last decade, but the ‘Noles and ‘Canes are ranked in the top 25 and considered two of the favorites in a watered-down ACC. 
This game could go a long way in 
determining which team will come away with a BCS bid at the end of the year. 
We’ll keep the intro short and sweet 
this week while praying for your un-derstanding. 
Miami (-6) will cover the spread 
because … 
Tyler is tougher on the road than the 
Seminoles. 
Seriously , the kid routinely craps 
all over our music choices and auto-
matically gets the front seat because his 
6-foot-infinity frame is too tall to fold into the backseat. 
Tyler Jett is a walking mismatch. 
The Seminoles are not. 
I can’t get FSU’s 47-17 meltdown 
against Oklahoma in Norman out of my head, and it’s the main reason I can’t pick them to win this game. 
So I’m going to go ahead and pick 
Jacory Harris (so will FSU’s defensive backs) to lead UM to a hard-fought home victory . 
Florida State (+6) will at least keep 
it close because …
Jacory Harris is about as good a 
quarterback as Kyle Maistri. For those who read Kyle’s column this week, you 
SEE PICKS, PAGE 21may see that as a positive. He did boast of leading multiple 
intramural teams on playoff runs, after all.
Don’t get it twisted. Both field generals are 100-percent 
pure athlete. But both also have their vices. Kyle loves to roll — both out of the pocket and into holes, where he in turn rolls 
his ankle. And Jacory loves to play the position like it’s a game 
of darts. Fifty-yard touchdown! Interception! Thirty-yard run! 
Interception! Fumble! Interception! Interception!
Expect the Seminoles defense to feast on Jacory like Kyle 
feasts on Dreamland Barbecue: that is, with sauce all over their 
faces and slobber all over their friends.
Now on to the picks!Still somehow in first place with a 28-20 record is alligator -
Sports Assistant Editor Tyler “I do not care for this lukewarm hamburger, Destiny” Jett, who traveled to Café Risque on a res-taurant-review assignment Monday. He entered an immature food critic, he walked out a man. A man with a thinner wallet, 
but a man nonetheless. 
Coming in second with a 27-21 record is GatorBait.net’s 
Keith “Seriously, kids, get off my lawn” Niebuhr, who couldn’t 
understand why some of us younger writers would want to toss a football around while waiting to do interviews. We get it, Keith, you’re old and joyless. Don’t ruin it for the rest of us. 
In a tie for third-place mediocrity with a 26-22 record is 
Alligator football writer Mike “Alabama man” McCall, who wouldn’t stop talking about the “white man’s paradise” in 
Tuscaloosa. Southern Belles and barbecue is all Mike needs. 
Diversity and tolerance, not so much. 
Tied with Mike is The Gainesville Sun’s Edward “Meat 
Market” Aschoff, whose eyes rolled into the back of his head and toes curled up while he told any member of the media who would listen about his dream recruiting commitment act. It in-volves lots of sweaty teenage muscles and not a lot of clothes. 
In fifth place with a 25-23 record is Kyle “I like little girls” 
Maistri, whose description of his “type” during last weekend’s 
road trip caused the rest of the writers to access the govern-
ment’s registered sex offenders website on their smartphones. He meant “short,” which is even more troubling considering he is a journalist. Buy a thesaurus, kid.
In sixth place with a not-to-hot, not-to-cold, just-right re-
cord of 24-24 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “I‘m not here to hate on technology” Jones, who loves “Eastbound and Down” but doesn’t have the means (HBO) to watch it. When a few of us offered to wait for him to watch our DVR-ed episode, he re-warded our kindness by downloading it and watching without us. Someone should have told him Big Boobs April isn’t in this season. You don’t have to be careful about getting “excited” in 
front of other people, Cody.
In seventh place with a 22-26 record is alligatorSports Editor 
Anthony “I promise I wasn’t applying for a Sean John mod-
eling gig” Chiang, who failed to delete his high school “dan-gerous on the outside, sweet on the inside” pictures from his Facebook profile. Head tilted to the side. Eyes narrowed. Lips pursed. You had it down perfect, Anthony.
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 21-27 
is the Miami Herald’s Joe “No PGP! ”Goodman, who recently told us a tale of his southern Bar-Mitzvah. His freshmen base-ball coach threw an end-of-the-year party for his team that in-cluded a keg, liquor and two strippers. We can only hope some kind soul does the same for your sons, Joe. FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 21
have another guy go in and throw the ball a little bit. His ribs were 
so sore, but he’s fine now.”
In other injury news, defensive tackle Brandon Antwine (shoul-
der) and kicker Caleb Sturgis (back) will not play this week.
Still looking for playmakers: Five weeks into the season, Mey-
er said the team has still not found a go-to player on offense who 
can get the ball across the goal line.
“We got to score touchdowns,” Meyer said. 
“That’s the biggest issue right now is finding out who’s going to physically put that ball in the end zone. Whether it be go up and make a great catch, or is it tailback, is it quarterback? Who’s going to 
punch the ball in the end zone?”
The Gators rank sixth in the Southeastern Conference with 31.4 
points per game.NOTEBOOK , from page 20the second coming!
It would make for a cute story, but it isn’t 
true.
Sure, there are some similarities, but Burton is 
a different type of player.
Tebow was one of the nation’s most coveted 
prospects coming out of high school after spend-
ing his prep career dominating with both his legs 
and his arm. From the moment he announced he 
would attend UF, he was the quarterback of the 
future.
Burton was a three-star prospect surrounded 
by serious doubts about his skill throwing the ball, an area where even he admits he isn’t the best. He’s functioning as a Swiss Army knife for 
Florida’s offense, and he’s doing it pretty well.
But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
CBS commentators went so far as to try and 
stir up a quarterback controversy between Bur -ton and starter John Brantley during the Florida-Alabama broadcast, which evoked memories of the calls to replace Chris Leak with Tebow in 2006.
Here’s one thing Tebow and Burton have in 
common: both of those ideas were stupid.
The biggest complaint about Brantley is he’s 
too one-dimensional to run the option and that Burton’s running ability makes him a better fit. That’s true, but Burton’s struggles throwing the ball would make him predictable, too. At least with Brantley and a running back, the offense 
can have some balance.
Burton is a good change-of-pace option, just 
like Tebow was as a freshman. 
But Tebow grew from that into a premier 
quarterback, which isn’t the likely path for Bur -
ton. Not to knock him, but he isn’t the quarter -
back of the future.
He’s a good football player with a chance to 
be great, but let’s not try to make him something 
he’s not.MIKE , from page 20DT Antwine won’t play

As the 2009 season drew to a 
close, many expected the libero 
position to become a weakness for 
Florida. 
The Gators were faced with the 
graduation of Elyse Cusack, who 
is the Southeastern Conference’s all-time digs leader and a four-
year starter. The options to replace 
her were freshman Taylor Unroe or first-time starter Erin Fleming. 
But now, just ten months later, 
the emergence of Fleming and the 
addition of junior college transfer 
Cinthya Roberto has raised the libero position from a weakness 
to one of the team’s strengths, not 
just for this year but also as the 
Gators look forward to 2011. 
With Unroe still recovering 
from a broken left ankle and Flem-ing suffering the effects of a con-
cussion she sustained in Friday’s match, Roberto took control of the 
position Sunday against Arkan-
sas. 
And although Fleming is ex-
pected to return to the starting 
lineup when No. 2 Florida (12-1, 
5-0 SEC) travels to Tuscaloosa, 
Ala., to take on Alabama (8-7, 0-5 
SEC) tonight at 8, Roberto made a 
strong impression in her limited 
action. 
“Cinthya did a terrific job for 
us,” coach Mary Wise said. “She handled it just as you would hope. She went after it, took every rep as learning but gave it great effort 
and great intensity.”
Roberto contributed eight digs, 
an ace, an assist and several set-
table passes in her first-ever start 
as a libero. Perhaps most importantly, 
Florida’s back-row defenders dis-played very little drop off in coor -
dination despite being under new 
leadership.
“I felt really comfortable be-
cause my teammates helped me out a lot,” Roberto said. “We were all captains at the same time.”
Roberto’s journey to the start-
ing lineup was not an easy one, as the Brazilian-born junior spent her 
first two years of eligibility as an 22, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2010

Today the UF women’s golf team begins the three-day Tar 
Heel Invitational in Chapel Hill, N.C., boasting a field of 13 teams 
ranked in the top-25, including No. 1 LSU, No. 3 Alabama and No. 5 Georgia. 
No. 24 Florida’s play has been a mixed bag this season. Incon-
sistency and big numbers have been interspersed with stretches of 
seemingly endless birdies and great individual performances. 
Coach Jan Dowling believes the team can make a statement this 
weekend, though.
“That’s one of the reasons we have the schedule we do,” Dowl-
ing said. “One of these days we’re going to bring our ‘A’ game and it’s all going to come together for us. We’re excited.”
Dowling said her team has yet to reach its full potential, but she 
feels the team is capable of competing with the best in the coun-
try.
Much will be found out this weekend.
For a team featuring just one golfer — No. 55 Andrea Watts 
–— ranked in the top 100, the tournament pro-
vides an opportunity for the optimistic UF team to announce its arrival. 
If the Gators want to impress in Tar Heel coun-
try , they’ll need the consistent play of juniors Evan Jensen and Andrea Watts to continue. Watts leads the team with a 73 scoring average, and Jensen is 
hot on her heels with an average of 73.43. 
Sophomore Mia Piccio has been arguably the most prolific 
player of the young season. Piccio has fired five rounds of 73 or better, but she also battled the bogey demons at times. Fellow sophomore Isabelle Lendl and senior Jessica Yadloczky round out 
the UF squad competing this weekend at the UNC Finley Golf 
Course. 
Entering the season, expectations for Lendl were high. She was 
the only UF golfer ranked in the top 100, and she played second 
in the rotation in the opening tournament at the TPC at Sawgrass. 
But after poor showings in back-to-back tournaments, Lendl spent 
the weekend of the Mason Rudolph Invitational in Gainesville 
while her sister Marika traveled to Nashville, Tenn.
In addition to a bounce-back performance from Lendl, the 
Gators will need strong showings from each golfer, something that has yet to happen this season. Gators begin

After the Gators football team failed to 
ride into Tuscaloosa, Ala., and win a prime-
time game, the university’s other football team will look to pick up the slack.
The No. 6 Gators (10-1-1, 4-0 Southeastern 
Conference) will travel to Alabama to take on the Crimson Tide tonight at 8 and the Auburn Tigers on Sunday at 3 p.m. in a weekend set against the SEC West’s top-two teams. 
After defeating Ole Miss and Mississippi 
State, Florida is looking to continue its SEC dominance after starting the season unde-feated in conference play, conceding just one goal.
While much has been made about the 
lack of finishing, the Gators newly formed defense has been dominant. UF has allowed just six goals this season. It is second in the conference with seven shutouts and has the highest save percentage and fewest goals al-lowed in the SEC.
Nicky Kit and Jazmyne Avant have be-
come mainstays in the starting lineup, while 
senior Ashlee Elliott has made the transi-
tion from forward to center back. The glue has been Williamson and goalkeeper Katie Fraine.
“They’ve really got a unit feel to them and 
that helps [our team],” coach Becky Burleigh said. “They’ve all matured as players and confidence has really helped the cohesive-ness of that group.”
Early in the season, Elliott struggled with 
UF’s zone defense, looking timid and con-fused with where she was supposed to be in correlation with her teammates. However, the senior has figured it out.
“I don’t think I’m a rookie back there any-
more,” she said.
Fraine agreed.“Communication has gotten a lot better 
as the season’s going on,” she said. “At the beginning there was less of a communication issue, but we didn’t understand each others’ styles.”Elliott said that the hard work in practice 
has helped the unit avoid any communica-tion issues.  All it has to worry about now she said are getting shutouts.“To make us look good we have to get 
shutouts. Anything we have to do to stop a goal we’ll do it because if they don’t score we win or tie, and that’s what we’ve done.” FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 23

uf CROSS COuNTRY
By JOHN BOOTHE

When the UF men’s and wom-
en’s cross country teams compete at 
the FSU Invitational today they will do so without top talent. 
Seven members of each squad 
will be held out of this week’s race in preparation for the Oct. 16 Pre-NCAA Invitational in Terre Haute, 
Ind., where the Gators will run 
against 37 ranked teams.
Even though there will be only 
two ranked programs, FSU and UF, competing in Tallahassee on Friday , the stakes are still high for runners looking to secure one of the last open spots. 
In the first two meets of the sea-
son, sophomores Danny Manco and Alex Schanen, and freshman Steph-anie Strasser have finished in the top 
eight for the Gators in each race. But 
as their teammates come back from injury and into race form they have been pushed down the depth chart. 
“Any other year I would’ve been 
taking them to Pre-NCAAs, but this year, the group’s really tight and strong,” UF cross country coach Todd Morgan said. “They’d be in a 
lot of school’s top fives and maybe 
even a lot of school’s number ones. But that’s the price sometimes of be-ing on a really good team.”Four UF women’s runners were 
held out of last week’s Wisconsin adidas Invitational and are pegged to run in Indiana, the same for the men’s team.
Strasser, who has placed fifth 
and sixth on the 
team during her first two races, said she was dis-appointed after missing out on the Pre-NCAA squad but looks 
forward to gaug-
ing her form in 
Tallahassee. 
“I’m kind of in the leadership role this week,” Strasser said. “I want to go out there and just go on to win it pretty much and be as close to the front as I can be.”
The Gators women’s team fell 20 
spots to No. 27 after a seventh-place finish at the Wisconsin Invitational. A win over No. 3 FSU could go a long way in helping UF’s ranking.
In contrast, the men’s team was 
helped by its seventh-place finish, moving into the rankings at No. 30.
Manco said he expects a different 
dynamic for the men’s race without 
some of UF’s top runners to “feed off 
of” and pace the team. Like Strasser, he wants to assume a leadership position during the race, as he has run FSU’s course multiple times as a Gator and in high school.
“It’s still an 8K, so you can’t let 
down your guard,” Manco said. “Little things can happen and sur -
prise you here and there and before you know it, bad things happen. It’s a race for a reason, so you can never take it lightly.”
Even with the absence of team 
leaders and the added incentive of championship-meet spots on the line, he said he doesn’t expect any-one to approach the meet with the 
intent of seeking individual glory.
The FSU Invitational starts at 
6:20 p.m. today with the women’s 
5K race followed by the men’s 8K.
Gators to compete in FSU Invitational without top runners

CHAMPIONSHIPS THIS SEASON.

Senior Alexandre Lacroix went right to 
work Thursday, winning his first two matches 
of the main draw in the ITA All-American in Tulsa, Okla. 
No. 9-Lacroix started strong in the first 
round, beating No. 66 Brennan Boyajian of North Carolina in straight sets (6-3, 6-4). 
No. 51 Nick Meister of UCLA made Lacro-
ix work in their second-round match, battling the senior for three sets before falling 1-6, 6-3, 6-2. 
After winning the Napa Valley Classic and 
Gator Invitational, Lacroix is on a mission 
to pick up his third singles championship of 
this young season. However, he has a tough matchup in round three against No. 21 Rhyne Williams of Tennessee. 
Only a sophomore, Williams emerged 
as one of the top players in the country last spring, as he was the 2010 Southeastern Con-ference Freshman of the Year, an SEC All-Freshman Team selection and a First Team 
All-SEC selection. 
Tough day for women’s tennis: After 
reaching the final round of the qualifying 
draw of the ITA All-American Champion-ships, three Gators came up short against tough opponents Thursday . 
Freshmen Sofie Oyen and Alexandra Cer -
cone and sophomore Caroline Hitimana all lost their matches.
All three Gators faced highly-ranked op-
ponents, including two players ranked in the ITA’s top-25. 
Oyen, who earned a spot 
in the qualifying as a “lucky 
loser,” lost to North Carolina 
State’s Sanaa Bhambri in three sets. The freshman proved a tough out, as she and Bhambri 
split the first two sets before Bhambri earned a 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 win. 
Coming off five consecutive wins, Cercone 
looked to keep her streak alive against No. 21 Mallory Burdette of Stanford but lost (6-4, 7-6(6)). 
Hitimana dropped her match against No. 
22 Marta Lesniak of Southern Methodist in straight sets (6-3, 6-4). 
In the main draw, the Gators didn’t fare any 
better, losing in both doubles and singles. 
The duo of Lauren Embree and Joanna 
Mather fell to Arkansas’ Anouk Tigu and Claudine Paulson (8-5), while Oyen and Al-lie Will lost to Clemson’s Josipa Bek and Keri Wong (8-6). 
Both doubles teams will play in the conso-
lation draw on Friday . 
No. 5 Will also lost in the first round against 
No. 20 Kristi Boxx of Mississippi in three sets (4-6, 6-4, 7-5). Lacroix beats pair of top-100 opponents to begin main draw
