Bouncers Indoor Playground held its second annual Fourth of July Bicycle Parade with a turnout of less than a tenth of 
what it was in 2019. A year prior, 100 kids attended—this year only eight came to ride their bicycles, tricycles and scoot -
ers around the parking lot. Angie Adams, manager of Bouncers Indoor Playground, attributed the reduced turnout to the 
pandemic but proceeded with the event because she said, “It’s still important to celebrate the Fourth of July.”
A WHEELIE GOOD TIME
‘IT FEELS HORRIBLE,’ 
ONE STUDENT SAID. 
‘I’M ALWAYS WATCHING 
MY BACK.’
Ariana Aspuru 
Alligator Staff Writer 
Thousands of phones 
across Gainesville lit up with 
a University Police alert: 
Suspect, black male, it said. 
Deionté Harvey stayed in 
his dorm. He didn’t want to 
be racially profiled. 
During his four years on 
campus, the 22-year-old UF 
Spring 2020 graduate said 
he felt unsafe. He was never 
the suspect in those alerts, 
but he took longer routes to 
his dorm, Murphree Hall, to 
avoid UPD presence around 
Midtown anyway. 
“It feels horrible, ” Harvey 
said. “I’m always watching 
my back. ” 
Harvey isn’t the only one. 
Students across UF are call -
ing on the university to ad -
dress racial inequality on 
campus amid national de -
mands to end systemic rac -
ism. Five members of the UF 
community told The Alliga -
tor they’re tired of solidarity 
statements from university 
administrators—they want 
action. 
During Mackintosh 
Joachim’s freshman year, 
white nationalist Rich -
ard Spencer visited cam -
pus. Black graduates were 
shoved offstage during a UF 
commencement ceremony 
in his sophomore year, and 
a year later, Donald Trump 
Jr. visited, too. 
These and other inci -
dents have left the 21-year-
old UF political science, 
African American studies 
and women’s studies senior 
feeling exhausted and un -
safe, he said. He’s the presi -
dent of the Gator chapter of 
the NAACP , but he said he 
sometimes feels like giving 
up. 
“Something always hap -
pens, ” he said. “Racial rela -
tions in the University of 
Florida get worse and worse 
every year. ”
Joachim said he doesn’t 
want future Black students 
to share his experience as a 
Black person at UF: unwant -ed and unsafe. 
Oluwayemi Olajubu, a 
Black 21-year-old UF digital 
arts and sciences junior, said 
he feels unwanted on cam -
pus, too. He’s overheard stu -
dents using racial slurs, and 
he walks to class in a sea of 
people who look nothing 
like him. 
The presence of UPD on 
campus puts him on edge, 
he added. 
“It feels kind of suffocat -
ing when you walk through 
Turlington, and there’s like 
three squad cars in the area, ” 
he said. “You kind of walk on 
eggshells. ”
Harvey, Joachim and 
Olajubu’s experiences aren’t 
unique. 
More than 4,750 people 
have signed a petition cre -
ated by the UF Black Stu -
dent Union demanding that 
the university implement 
a zero-tolerance policy for 
hate speech, require diver -
sity training for administra -
tive faculty and reduce the 
presence of UPD on campus 
to improve the experience 
of Black students at UF. 
Nearly two weeks after 
the petition launched, UF 
President Kent Fuchs shared 
a list of initiatives to combat 
racism and inequality at UF.
The plans include requir -
ing racism, inclusion and 
bias training for all students 
and faculty as well as end -
ing the university’s use of 
prison and jail labor.   
“It is past time for UF 
to commit and engage in 
this challenging, uncom -
fortable, transformational 
work, ” he wrote. 
Harvey said that Fuchs’ 
efforts to recognize rac -
ism on campus feel empty. 
Without direct action, they 
mean nothing, he said. He 
wants the university to 
heed the requests from BSU 
and the petition signers.
“Now is the time to show 
you actually care about your 
students, ” he said. “Don’t 
let this opportunity go to 
waste. Please listen to us. ”

their campus stories
THE REITZ UNION AND 
O’CONNELL CENTER ARE 
KNOWN FOR HAVING 
CONTROVERSIAL NAMESAKES 
Ariana Aspuru 
Alligator Staff Writer 
Bree Turner gets a bitter taste in her 
mouth when she walks into the Reitz 
Union. Students walk in and visit with their 
friends at the food court, prepare for a club 
meeting or play a round of ping-pong—
oblivious to her discomfort. 
When she walks through those glass 
doors, she thinks of the building’s name -
sake, Julius Wayne Reitz: a former UF presi -
dent accused of racism.   
Amid Black Lives Matter protests and 
public outrage about institutional racism, 
Turner and thousands of UF students and 
faculty have signed petitions calling for UF 
to remove the names of figures with racist 
pasts like Stephen C. O’Connell and Reitz from buildings on campus. 
Turner, a 21-year-old UF political science 
and theater senior, said the figureheads 
should not be memorialized on campus. As 
a Black student, she said it’s frustrating to 
watch these names persist despite years of 
requests for them to be taken down. 
In an article from the Florida Historical 
Society, Reitz is characterized as a “practical 
segregationist” who sought to keep Black 
enrollment down at UF. Reitz also allowed 
the Johns Committee, a Florida legislative 
investigation committee named after Sen -
ator Charley Johns, to target gay people in 
the 1950s and ‘60s, resulting in 15 UF pro -
fessors and more than 50 students leaving 
UF, according to the UF Smathers Libraries 
website. 
Calls to rename the Reitz have echoed 
around campus for years, including in a 
2019 Student Government referendum, 
or question on a student government 
ballot, which asked students if they want 
to change the namesake to honor Vir -
gil D. Hawkins, a civil rights activist who helped Black people gain access to higher 
education in Florida in the 1940s and ’50s. 
Hawkins also helped desegregate the UF 
Levin College of Law and the university’s 
graduate and professional schools. SG 
never voted on it because the deadline for 
the referendum passed due to a canceled 
meeting. 
A similar one appeared on SG ballots 
even earlier in 2012. A total of 1,764 stu -
dents voted to rename the building after 
Virgil D. Hawkins, but 5,469 students voted 
against the name change and it was not 
approved.
Anthony Rojas, a 24-year-old UF politi -
cal science master’s student, created a peti -
tion June 5 asking the UF administration to 
rename the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, J. 
Wayne Reitz Student Union and six other 
UF buildings on campus whose namesakes 
were racist or homophobic. As of July 5, the 
petition had more than 6,990 signatures.

Debates turn emotional as schools 
decide how and if to open
Across America, school districts are 
preparing their plans on how to re -
open in the Fall. Classroom settings 
will be radically different due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, with buses 
running below the usual capacity 
and quarantine protocols in place 
for when students become sick. The 
plans for the upcoming school year 
are taking shape by the day, and 
vary district to district, state to state. 
The debates have been highly emo -
tional, with tempers flaring among 
parents and administrators, and 
have been made all the more vexing 
by record numbers of COVID-19 cas -
es being reported each day. Florida 
schools are preparing to go back to 
a classroom setting in August—de -
spite the state’s rising cases. Florida 
has reported more than 7,000 cases 
daily, more than seven times the 
amount the state was reporting a 
month ago. Districts in many states 
are worried about the cost of going 
back to school in the Fall. Many will 
have to invest in more buses and 
masks for faculty and students. The Latest: Fearing outbreak, 
Spain locks down county of 71K
A northwestern Spain county has 
been locked down following orders 
from authorities. The county, which 
has a population of 71,000, was 
locked down following COVID-19 
concerns. Regional authorities an -
nounced that travel to and from the 
county would be prohibited start -
ing at midnight. The lockdown will 
last until Friday, it comes two weeks 
after Spain ended a national state 
of emergency that enabled the na -
tional government to lockdown the 
entire country and prohibit travel 
between provinces or certain areas 
since mid-March. More than 28,000 
people are confirmed to have died 
from the virus in Spain.
‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’ hymn 
ignites hope across nation
The Black national anthem was born 
more than a century ago, but the 
popular hymn within the African 
American community called “Lift 
Every Voice and Sing” has resur -
rected as a beacon of hope dur -
ing nationwide protests. In recent 
weeks, countless rallies were held 
from D.C. to Seattle with arm-locked protesters of different races re -
citing the song’s lyrics while 
marching against police brutal -
ity of unarmed Black people. The 
demonstrations throughout the 
U.S. were ignited after George 
Floyd was killed when a for -
mer Minneapolis police officer 
pressed a knee into his neck for 
several minutes. At many protests, 
demonstrators sang the lyrics to 
represent faithfulness, freedom 
and equality. In 1919, the NAACP 
dubbed “Lift Every Voice and Sing” 
as the Black national anthem. This 
move came more than a decade 
before the U.S. adopted “The Star-
Spangled Banner” as its national 
anthem. The NFL plans on play -
ing the song before every game 
during Week 1, a source told The 
Associated Press. 
Sheriff: 2 dead, 8 hurt in South 
Carolina nightclub shooting
A shooting at a nightclub early 
Sunday left two people dead 
and eight wounded in South 
Carolina, a sheriff’s official said. 
Two Greenville County sheriff’s 
deputies noticed a disturbance at 
Lavish Lounge just before 2 a.m., 
and saw a large crowd running 
out of the building, Sheriff Hobart 
Lewis said at a press conference. 
There was “active gunfire from in -
side the building, ” Lt. Jimmy Bolt 
said in an initial statement, and 
Lewis said all the shots were fired 
inside. Lewis and Bolt initially said 
12 people had been wounded — 
with at least four in critical condi -
tion, Lewis said — but Bolt told 
The Associated Press that two vic -
tims were likely counted twice in 
the confusion at the hospital.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 84

TWO PERSPECTIVES ON 
THE IMPORTANCE OF 
COSMETOLOGY AND THE 
FUTURE OF A MOVEMENT
Lonnie Numa
Avenue Staff Writer
Saditty—it’s a word that aspires to 
be more than it is, carrying an air of su -
periority and overconfidence. It’s a term 
Lakheria Hines always identified with, 
but never questioned the significance 
of until she sought to create a brand she 
could be proud of as a budding entre -
preneur. 
Hines, a 20-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology junior, 
founded the online hair supply store, 
Sadity Hairphoria, in March 2019. Man -
aging the workload of a full-time stu -
dent and a growing clientele has its 
challenges, but Hines would never let 
anything jeopardize the quality of her 
merchandise, she said. 
“My whole message is to basically 
make women feel beautiful, ” Hines said. 
“I’m not selling anything less than what I 
feel like these women deserve. ” 
Within the Black community, hair 
is essential to one’s sense of identity, 
Hines said. Social media platforms have 
become a place for Hines to share in 
that identity and create a name for her -
self at UF, she said.
“I can DM another woman about her 
wig like, ‘Hey, this wig is gorgeous, ’ not 
knowing that I’m boosting her self-es -
teem, ” Hines said. “Women get their hair 
done not only to enhance their look, 
but to embrace who they are. ”
The effects of COVID-19 and the 
Black Lives Matter movement have giv -
en Sadity Hairphoria the most attention 
it’s ever had, Hines said. Her business is 
one of many to be recognized amid the 
heightened awareness surrounding the 
many injustices the Black community 
faces, she said.
Hines hopes the community built 
around the movement will persist, but 
she’s not certain the support will contin -
ue once the hashtags stop trending. As 
a Black business owner, she chooses to 
stand by her business’ authenticity and 
her mission to bring out every woman’s 
inner beauty, Hines said. 
“It’s kind of like a visual representa -
tion of myself, ” Hines said. “Whatever I 
want my business to stand for, I make 
sure that I’m standing on it as well. ” 
Lakisha Turner, owner of Beauty & 
Braids Salon and Supply, is more opti -
mistic about a change in attitude to -
wards the Black community for the bet -
ter, she said. She’s hoping to fan a spark 
into a flame by closing her store on 
Election Day in order to offer free rides 
to the polls, Turner said. 
“There’s no excuses anymore not to vote, ” Turner said. “Everybody’s com -
plaining, but nobody’s willing to do 
anything about it. ” 
Turner, 32, has been a licensed cos -
metologist since 2013 and founded 
Beauty & Braids in 2019. In addition 
to supplying hair among other ac -
cessories, Turner’s salon offers a wide 
range of diverse braiding styles to suit a 
unique customer base, Turner said. 
Beauty & Braids was slated for a 
grand opening, but COVID-19 skewed 
Turner’s plans, causing her to close 
down her salon for two months, she 
said. 
To her surprise, clients were still 
reaching out—which speaks to the 
nature of hair within the identity of the 
Black community, Turner said. 
“I’d say we are very essential, ” Turner 
said. “People were willing to sacrifice 
their life to get their hair done. ”
Turner fears the uptick in COVID-19 
cases may trigger another shutdown, 
she said. But the widespread support 
she’s received over the weeks have 
helped the business blossom into 
something she could have never imag -
ined, Turner said. 
Though Turner lives among like-
minded people who value progress, 
she empathizes with those who doubt 
the current upheaval will have any last -
ing effects, she said. Her way of sup -
porting the movement as a Black busi -
ness owner is to weave happiness into 
every braid she pleats, Turner said. 
“All I can do is make sure you’re 
beautiful each and every day, ” she said. 
“Make sure you can come get every -
thing you need to feel as beautiful as 
you want through your daily life. ”

HOW A LOCAL 
24-YEAR-OLD BLACK 
ENTREPRENEUR OPENED 
HIS FIRST RESTAURANT
Michelle Holder
Avenue Staff Writer
Christopher Hopkins was cooking 
seafood in his grandmother’s front 
yard with his girlfriend, Lynette Blake -
ley. As the two of them chatted over 
sizzling crab legs and shrimp, they 
came up with their future restaurant’s 
name. 
Inspired by the four palms making 
the food together, they landed on the 
name 4 Paumes (paumes is the French 
translation of palms, pronounced like 
“pome”). The restaurant sells seafood 
and chicken, and the recipes are Hop -
kins’  innovations.
“I think of it like giving people a 
flavor that is not around, so it’s like a 
foreign taste, ” Hopkins, 24, said. “Not 
French, but it’s a foreign taste. ”
However, in 2018, Hopkins had his 
two palms chained behind his back.
Hopkins was charged with mari -
juana possession with intent to distrib -
ute. He was sentenced to 372 days in 
prison at the Department of Correc -
tions at Lake Correctional Institution in 
Clermont, FL.
“I experienced modern-day slav -
ery, ” he said. “I truly experienced 
modern-day slavery where you didn’t 
have a choice but to get up and work. If you didn’t, you get beat up, you get 
pepper-sprayed and locked into a box 
for 60 days. I witnessed this. ”
Hopkins suffers from ocular sar -
coidosis, a disease that affects his vi -
sion. During his time in prison, he had 
a particularly bad flare up, causing his 
eyes to swell up and be bloodshot red. 
He said the prison staff would not give 
him his medication or any pain reliever, 
and even if he was too sick to work, he 
was forced to get up. 
“When I was forced to work while I 
was sick, it made me really want to put 
myself in a position to make a change, ” 
he said. 
Once Hopkins was free, he said he 
worked every day and saved his mon -
ey. He became deaf to doubters and 
haters, and he focused on his vision 
for his business and a better future. His 
work paid off when ten months later, 
he held the keys to his first restaurant.
A Gainesville native, Hopkins was 
born and raised in the Copeland com -
munity. It was destiny that he ended 
up opening his restaurant in the same 
community he grew up in, he said. 
Hopkins envisions opening multiple 
businesses throughout Gainesville in 
the future, he said. He plans to get in -
volved in the technology industry as 
well as expand his food business. 
His time in prison gave him the 
drive to be great, he said. The oppres -
sion and cruelty he faced behind bars 
propelled him to who he is today.
With the Black Lives Matter move -
ment and recent public outrage over 
George Floyd’s murder and other in -justices, Hopkins said he has felt local 
support from both the Black and white 
community in Gainesville. 
“I look at the protests, and I see it as 
a benefit, ” he said. “I see racism as a big 
problem. ”
4 Paumes has been open since 
March 16. With the ongoing pandem -
ic, business trickled to a halt, but in the 
past month, it has slowly picked up 
again. 
Amy Dinh, a 47-year-old health 
care worker, ate at 4 Paumes with her 
family to support Gainesville’s local 
businesses.
“With the current impact of corona 
on small businesses, as well as the tre -
mendous racial inequality that many 
caucasians are finally beginning to see 
and acknowledge, it felt great to sup -
port a young African American, ” Dinh 
said. 
Hopkins said he hopes his restau -
rant can serve as a location where ev -
erybody can come together and enjoy 
each other’s company, regardless of 
race.
“When I was in prison, I told every -
body, I said, ‘When y’all get out, y’all 
look up 4 Paumes and stop by, come 
see me, because I have a restaurant, ’” 
he said. “I wanted to make sure that I 
can be an example for all of them in -
side of the system. ”

“THOSE ARE REAL LABORERS DOING REAL LABOR 
WITHOUT PAY AND WITHOUT CHOICE,” SAID ONE 
UF GRADUATE. 
By Nicole Rodriguez
Alligator Staff Writer 
Will Boose thinks UF’s decision to end its use of unpaid prison labor is long 
overdue. 
Now, he wants to know how UF will keep its promise.
When UF President Kent Fuchs outlined a set of initiatives to address rac -
ism and inequity at UF on June 18, it included ending the use of prison and jail 
inmate labor in UF’s agricultural operations. 
Though the university will not have prison labor contracts in the future, its 
existing contracts will not end until July 21, 2021, at the latest, according to a 
university statement issued July 2.
“As we move forward in implementing these initiatives, we are committed 
to this challenging, uncomfortable transformational work, and we will update 
and involve the community accordingly throughout the process, ” the state -
ment read.
When asked about the extent of UF’s use of prison labor and why UF decid -
ed to end the practice now when it has been protested in the past, UF spokes -
person Steve Orlando declined to comment and referred The Alligator to the 
university’s statement.
The statement came in response to a letter from the Coalition to Abolish 
Prison Slavery, a group dedicated to ending UF’s use of prison labor. Prior to 
receiving the letter, UF did not specify how or when the practice would end.
“The university just told us they will be continuing to use prison slavery, a 
practice that they publicly deemed immoral in June 18’s statement, for a year, 
in the same message that they say they are committed to the work of realizing 
transformative changes, ” said Boose, the co-founder of CAPS and a UF Spring 
2020 graduate.
The timeline to end UF’s current contracts allows an additional year of ex -
ploiting unpaid and forced laborers, he added. He said the university is “think -
ing about this in capitalistic and profiteering terms, ” and not considering the 
human impact these contracts will have.
Florida is one of the few states that still relies on unpaid prison labor, ac -
cording to the Gainesville Sun, and UF uses more prison labor than any other 
college in the state. As of May 2019, UF had used 156,684 hours of state prison 
labor since 2015. 
“Those are real laborers doing real labor without pay and without choice, ” 
Boose said. “It’s sick that UF decides to brag about the cost-savings that they 
have sucked out of prison slavery rather than to recognize the ways that they 
have violently exploited fellow humans. ”
Matt Rodriguez, another member of CAPS, said UF should be transparent 
about how it’s addressing the end of prison labor and other issues dealing with 
racism on campus.
Students are taking a more active role in the university, the 21-year-old UF 
public relations senior added. They are carefully reviewing and monitoring 
their school’s actions and making sure they align with their own, he said. 
“It is the entire student population, and the entire population of our state, 
that deserves this information, ” Rodriguez said.  “It needs to come straight from 
the source: the UF administration. ”

COVID-19
By Noah Ram
Sports Writer
The last memory Stuart Hall, the 
father of Gators soccer player Cam -
eron Hall, had from April 6 to April 
24 was watching the film “Creed. ”
On the night of April 6, Stuart, 
who began showing symptoms of 
COVID-19 on March 25, was taken 
to the emergency room and started 
to fight for his life.
“I’ll never forget what he (the 
cardiologist) said, ” Cameron said. 
“If it was just his heart, I’d give him 
a 50 percent chance, but with ev -
erything going on, I don’t give him 
much hope. ”
Stuart had a heart attack in -
duced by COVID-19. He seemed al -
most certain to be the next victim 
the virus would take.
He would remain in the inten -
sive care unit, intubated, for the 
next 18 days and then remained in 
the ICU for an additional five days.
During this time, Cameron and 
her family couldn’t be with him.
“We lived from phone calls ev -
ery day, ” Cameron said. “And that 
was on an hourly basis of my mom 
checking in with nurses or the 
nurse practitioner calling us. ”
On April 29, Stuart was taken 
out of the ICU, and three days later, 
he was finally released from the 
hospital.
That day capped off a whirl -
wind five-week period for the Hall 
family, when Stuart went from a 
healthy 52-year-old man to some -
one whose passing felt inevitable 
to a person who has a new perspec -
tive on life.
Stuart Hall was a person whom 
few would have expected to be hit 
by this crippling virus.
Despite that Cameron’s family 
is from Buford, Georgia, a suburb 
northeast of Atlanta, Stuart could 
be seen at nearly every match and 
scrimmage the team had.This led to Stuart building a 
close connection with the Gators 
soccer program.
“Even though she (Cameron) has 
only played one year, I do feel like I 
know her family pretty well, ” coach 
Becky Burleigh said.
That sentiment was shared by 
goalkeeper Francesca Faraci. The 
two sophomores have become best 
friends because they were room -
mates. Through their friendship, 
Faraci has become close with the 
Hall family.
One event sticks out to Faraci 
that showcases the Halls’ kindness.
Faraci is from Park Ridge, Illi -
nois, outside Chicago, so she did 
not have the opportunity to come 
back to campus to move out of her 
dorm after classes were moved on -
line. Instead, Stuart and Kellee, Stu -
art’s wife, moved out all of Faraci’s 
belongings. This is despite, at that 
point, Stuart beginning to show 
symptoms of COVID-19.
“It shows a lot about them that 
they did this for me while starting 
to show symptoms, ” Faraci said.
On March 29, four days after 
Stuart said he began to experience 
symptoms, he was taken to the ER 
after his condition worsened.
“They didn't have enough tests, ”  
Stuart said. “They took an X-ray of 
my chest and determined that they 
were about 97 percent sure that 
my lungs showed all signs of hav -
ing COVID, so they asked us to go 
home and self-quarantine in our 
bedroom. ”
Stuart returned home with a 
prescription for the drug hydroxy -
chloroquine, which the Food and 
Drug Administration has since said 
shouldn’t be used outside of a hos -
pital setting.
His condition went downhill 
fast, according to Kellee.
“His heart was just racing non -
stop that whole weekend to the 
point where I didn’t leave his side because I was so anxious and 
couldn’t get him to calm down, ”  
Kellee said. “He couldn’t sleep the 
whole weekend. ”
Kellee’s plan was to wait and see 
until Stuart was done taking the hy -
droxychloroquine on April 6. While 
his fever did go away that day, by 
late afternoon, he had trouble 
breathing.
Kellee said Stuart didn’t want to 
go to the hospital because of the 
fear of intubation and being on a 
ventilator—and separated from his 
family.
But, around 1 a.m., Stuart said it 
was time to go to the emergency 
room.
“Things happened quickly when 
we got to the ER, ” Kellee said.
He was intubated immediately 
upon arrival, and the entire Hall 
family had to leave the ER.
“The first person to talk to me 
was a cardiologist, and they said 
that he had a heart attack, ” Kellee 
said. “Two and a half hours later, 
the cardiologist came back and said 
his main artery was 100 percent 
blocked. He also had congestive 
heart failure as his artery was being 
blocked. ”
Kellee, Cameron and the rest of 
the Hall family would not see him 
for another 20 days.
After Stuart went into the hospi -
tal, the entire Hall family was test -
ed. Kellee, Cameron, and her two 
siblings all tested negative despite 
everyone in the family showing 
symptoms at one time or another. 
Stuart suspects that, since he trav -
els for a living—he is the director of 
student leadership and leadership 
networking for the ReThink Group 
and also leads INFLUNSR, an orga -
nization whose mission is to fuel 
the next generation of leaders—he 
may have gotten a worse strain of 
COVID-19 than the rest of his fam -
ily.
The night Stuart was intubated, the first person Cameron contacted 
was Burleigh.
Burleigh said the two texted 
each other for a while before Cam -
eron eventually called her.
“I think it shows that we care 
about not just the player, but the 
person of everyone in our pro -
gram, ” Burleigh said. “The fact that 
she trusted us with such personal 
information at that time like that. 
That means a lot to me. ”
After telling Burleigh, she told 
Faraci, and then, the rest of the 
team.
Soon after, her teammates, 
along with Burleigh, began to post 
on social media and ask for prayers.
The reaction from Gator Nation was swift, with Hall receiving calls 
from people all over Gators ath -
letics, including Athletic Director 
Scott Stricklin.
During the first week of Stuart's 
hospital stay, Cameron posted daily 
updates on Twitter and Instagram.
Cameron said she did this be -
cause her family needed all the 
prayers they could get.

A former Florida football player has been indicted by a 
grand jury on bank fraud.
Kadeem Telfort, who played for the Gators as an offensive 
lineman during his freshman year in 2017, was charged with 
conspiracy to commit bank fraud as well as 17 counts of bank 
fraud, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Of -
fice June 30. The fraud occurred between July 1 and Oct. 31 in 
2017.While at Florida, Telfort was charged with taking part in a 
credit card scheme with eight other UF football players in 2017. 
He pleaded no contest, served two years of probation and was 
not reinstated to the team. He never played a down for the 
Gators. 
He later played football for the Garden City Community Col -
lege Broncbusters in Kansas and committed to the University 
of Alabama-Birmingham for the upcoming season.
Telfort worked with five FSU students who were members 
of Florida State’s Center for Academic Retention and Enhance -
ment (C.A.R.E), a program designed to aid “traditionally under -represented students disadvantaged by virtue of educational 
and socioeconomic reasons. ” One of those students, Kh’lajuwon 
Amari Murat, is also being charged with eight counts of aggra -
vated identity theft after he and Telfort illegally obtained credit 
and debit card numbers, according to the release.
The group allegedly obtained $53,000 in stolen funds, ac -
cording to the press release. Telfort and the other students 
were indicted after an investigation by the Florida State Uni -
versity Police Department and the United States Secret Service.
Telfort and the students are set to go to trial on Aug. 17.
