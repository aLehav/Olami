By ERIN O'DEA
Alligator Contributing Writer
For years, Steve Mesler has
waited to bring an Olympic gold
medal to his alma mater.
On Thursday morning, his wait
came to an end when the Olympic
bobsledder and UF graduate held
a gleaming gold medal before a
crowd of about 80 at the Florida
Gym courts Thursday.
He earned the medal at the
2010 Winter Olympics as a part of
the United States bobsled team,
which won the gold for the first
time in more than 60 years.
"I'm so excited to bring this
back here," Mesler said.
Mesler graduated from UF in
2000 with a degree in exercisek
about his experience as an Olym-pian and the importance of perse-
verance and focus.
Reminiscing about his career
as a track athlete at UF, Mesler
said he was a
weak competi-
tor.
When he was
on the track
Mesler would
always look for-2 little reasons not
Mesler to keep going.
When he was
a track athlete, he had a hard time
pushing himself to work toward
his goals.
This all changed when he was
banned from training in his se-
nior year and started doing his
own workout regimen.

UF food goes guilt-free
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
After months of negotiations, UF stu-
dents will be able to eat their cheeseburg-
ers without the side of guilt.
The Immokalee workers, who pick to-
matoes used by UF's food provider Ara-
mark, will receive about 1 cent more for
each pound of tomatoes they pick.
Aramark reached an agreement with
the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and
announced the agreement Thursday.
Under the agreement, Aramark will
also direct its tomato purchases to grow-
ers who follow a code of conduct outlin-
ing improved working conditions for the
workers.Richard Blake, a UF sociology sopho-
more and a member of the Student/Farm-
worker Alliance, helped organize the ne-
gotiations.
He said the Student/Farmworker Alli-
ance has held educational meetings, hand-
ed out fliers and organized several rallies
in support of the agreement
On and the code of conduct.
Campus "We were really excited
because we've put in a lot
of work over the last eight months or so,"
Blake said.
Greg Asbed, a staff member with CIW,
said the students and supporters at UF
helped the coalition's efforts to improve
the working conditions.

Legislature approves
Bright Futures proposal
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Both houses of the Florida Legislature
have approved proposals that would raise
qualifying SAT scores and ban reinstate-
ments for students who lose their scholar-
ships due to low grades.
The bill passed by the Senate with a
vote of 34-4 would raise the qualifying
SAT scores from 1270 to 1290 for the Flor-
ida Academic Scholars Award, the high-
est Bright Futures Scholarship Program
award, which gives students $126 per
credit hour.
For the Florida Medallion Scholars
Award, which pays students $95 per cred-it hour, the qualifying score would jump
from 970 to 1050.
The House bill, approved by the Re-
publican majority in a 74-44 vote down
party lines, would cut the Florida Aca-
demic Scholars award to $110 per credit
hour and the Florida Medallion Scholars
Award to $83 per credit hour.
"It's a positive step."
Steve Orlando
UF spokesman
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said UF
is glad to see the Legislature is trying to
address a program that's in need of seri-
ous changes.
"It's a positive step," he said.

David DiVirgilio showed that
UF boys really "are the squarest"

"At first I just laughed," DiVir-

DiVirgilio was one of 13 contes-
tants in the Gentlemen's Showcase,a national contest that took place
throughout March. Contestants
were nominated by a woman post-

describing what made her nominee
a gentleman on the Network of En-

Anyone could vote by "liking"
the post.
Contestants were from colleges

Gaincsvilc's Lcading Lady
Lady Pearl has performed for 20 years
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Staff Writer
William Moorehead walks into
University Club wearing board
shorts and a Gators polo, a Louis
Vuitton bag over his shoulder.
He's the type of guy who an-
tiques on Sundays. He's the type of
guy who watches "The Young and
the Restless" every weekday.
But at University Club, Gaines-
ville's only gay bar, no one knows
William Moorehead.
They know Lady Pearl, the sharp-
tongued, hip-swaying, 6-foot-4-inch
female impersonator who leads the
semiweekly drag show at the club.
For nearly 20 years, Lady Pearl
has entertained, picked on and par-
tied with generations of college stu-
dents and local club-goers. For the
last year and a half, her weekly per-
formances at the club have required
a 16-hour round-trip car ride from
her home in North Carolina.
Tonight is Lady Pearl's final per-
formance at University Club, and as
she prepares to say goodbye to her
weekly Gainesville gig, this drive is
the part she'll miss the least.
Coating her face with a layer of
light bronze powder, Lady Pearl, 50,
has her eyes -which are carefully
lined and fitted with glitzy false
lashes -set on bigger and bettergigs. She wants to take her talent to
television, and she said her agent is
pitching a show idea to HBO.But before she takes the next
step, she has to take her final bow at
the club where she landed her firstheadline show. She has to say good-
bye to her following -fans who slip
tips in her bra week after week.
Nearly an hour before show
time, she is in limbo -half Moore-
head, half Pearl. She lights the tip of
Before her weekly drag show begins, Lady Pearl puts on her makeup and clothing in a tiny dressing
room in the back of the University Club.her eyeliner on fire before tracing it
around her eyelids -the heat inten-
sifies the color.
"Words have too much power,"
she said. "But words don't have
power unless you give it to them."
It's just past 11:30 p.m., and she
welcomes the crowd with a hearty
holler (pronounced hel-lur).
The dance floor, her stage, is
speckled with puddles of spilled
drinks -it's all the fuel she needs.
"Y'all have got to stop peeing on
my floor," she told the crowd, eying
the stain. "It looks like drunk straight
girl pee -it's bubbling and shit."
It's jokes like this that make
"Lady Pearl's Pussy Cabaret" more
than a show where beautiful female
impersonators shimmy to pop songs
and country ballads.
At the cue of the spotlight, Lady
Pearl lip-synchs Whitney Houston's
"A Song for You."
"I've been so many places in my
life and time," she mouths. "I've
sung a lot of songs. I've made some
bad rhyme."
William Moorehead is nowhere
to be found. He's somewhere be-
hind folds of green velvet fabric.
Somewhere behind La Femme eye
shadow. Somewhere behind red
lips that sparkle under the disco ball
hanging from the ceiling.
The show is at 11:30 p.m. at Uni-
versity Club, 18 E University Ave.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH
Local charity to relocate
By ASHLEY LARA MOSES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Big Brothers Big Sisters has helped
youth in need for more than a 100 years.
Now, the mid-Florida chapter, located
in Gainesville, is hoping the community
will return the favor.
Big Brothers Big Sisters is a youth
mentoring program dedicated to help-
ing children in need.
The local organization lost more than
60 percent of its financing last year, and
it may have to relocate to save its orga-
nization.
The organization is considering sell-
ing its building, located at 1155 NW 13th
St.
According to Paul Halpern, the exec-
utive director of Big Brothers Big Sisters
of Mid-Florida, the organization is look-
ing for an inexpensive office space.
The move will save them money and
allow them to devote their resources to
helping the children in need.
Halpern said that the organization's
plan is to simplify the agency and cut
costs as much as it can while still pro-
viding all of the services of the organiza-
tion.
Between mortgage payments, insur-
ance, taxes and upkeep, the organization
is having trouble making ends meet.
Two realtors appraised the property
at about $350,000, Halpern said.
"We don't want to focus on the mon-
ey," Halpern said. "We want to focus on
the children we serve and the good sto-ries we have."
Halpern hopes that with the assis-
tance of the community, the organiza-
tion will be able to continue operating in
the Gainesville area.
Latifat Oginni, a Big Brothers Big Sis-
"We don't want to focus on the
money. We want to focus on the
children we serve and the good
stories we have."
Paul Halpern
executive director of Big Brothers Big
Sisters of Mid-Florida
ters of Mid-Florida volunteer, said that
the current financial situation has had a
great impact on the organization. It used
to serve the surrounding counties, but
now it can only serve Alachua County.
Also, students who want to get in-
volved with the program in Alachua
County are on waiting lists.
Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Flori-
da needs more employees just to be able
to handle the case load, she said
"This financial burden isn't allowing
us to function to our fullest potential,"
she said.
While Oginni feels that the organiza-
tion is suffering at the moment, she is
not discouraged.
"The last thing that's going to happen
is the doors closing," she said.

* THE CLUB SPENT ABOUT
$1,000 TO HOST THE EVENT.
By KATIE FINNEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
For UF biology junior Elizabeth
Mackall, the Chomp Cancer Carnival on
the Reitz Union North Lawn Thursday
was about more than free pizza and cot-
ton candy.
It was about her brother's battle with
non-Hodgkin lymphoma when he was
11 years old.
Although his cancer has been in re-
mission for the past five years, Mackall
felt a personal connection with the event,
which aimed to inform people about
pediatric cancer and drew a crowd of
about 200 students throughout the day.
"Not everybody realizes that cancer
happens to kids, and it's really sad to
see," she said. "It's really hard on the
family."
The Chomp Cancer Carnival was
sponsored by Friends for Life of Amer-
ica, which raises money for children
with cancer.
Dimple Patel, chairwoman of Friends
for Life of America at UF, said she want-
ed to use the event to promote the club'scause and recruit new members.
About 100 people signed up to be on
the organization's listserv, and the club
spent about $1,000 to host the event, Pa-
tel said.
The carnival offered free haircuts by
Reitz Union Hair Company stylist Stacy
Orcutt, who was stationed at a booth
near the club's tent.
Orcutt, 24, said she was looking for
someone with longer hair, preferably
about 12 inches long, so she could do-
nate the hair to Locks of
On Love, an organization that
Campus gives hairpieces to children
suffering from long-term
medical hair loss.
Between a bounce house and slide,
statistics from the Children's Cancer
Fund of America were posted around
the tent informing visitors of pediatric
cancer's prevalence.
One sign read that 46 children are
diagnosed with cancer each day while
another stated that one out of every 330
will develop cancer before age 20.
"A lot of people are affected by pe-
diatric cancer, and compared to other
cancers, not a lot of people know about
it. So [we're doing] whatever we can do
to help fundraise and spread the word,"
Patel said.

Actor, activist highlights culture of LGBT community
By JAMEL LANGLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
At the age of 19, Wilson Cruz was
ready to tell his secret.
He admits he was terrified of what
people would say. He admits he was
afraid of rejection from his family.
Despite his fears, Cruz decided to
embrace his sexuality and come out
to his friends and family.
Now 36, Cruz, an AIDS activist
and actor, spoke to a crowd of about
10 people at the Reitz Union's Arre-
dondo Room Thursday night about
accepting people for who they are.
This event was part of Pride
Awareness Month 2010, which is
dedicated to highlighting the cul-
ture and lives of the individuals that
make up the lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender and queer community
at UF.
"No one can define my truth,"
Cruz told the audience. "It is mine to
choose and mine to define."
Cruz spoke about his career as a
gay man in several artistic outlets,
including the Broadway musical
"Rent" and a 2009 romantic comedy,
"He's Just Not That into You.""I knew my career wouldn't be
the same emotionally if I didn't come
out," he said.
"No one can define my truth.
It is mine to choose and
mine to define."
Wilson Cruz
actor
He continued his presentation by
referencing the Rev. Martin Luther
King's concept of using "fierce ur-
gency" in the fight for equality.
"Our biggest contribution is com-
ing out and showing love," he said.
"We need to continue to inspire and
continue to reach out to what the hu-
man experience can be."
At the event, Cruz said he was
endorsing Gainesville mayoral can-
didate Craig Lowe, who is also gay.
"We need role models like Cruz
to be out and show love," said Al-
yssa Craig, Accent director of speak-
ers and performers. "It's that impor-
tant."
According to Accent Speaker's
Bureau, Cruz was paid $5,000 to
speak at the event.Laurie Hice Michaelson/ Alligator

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Administration not taking actions against audio tapes
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
University officials have decided not to
punish members of the Unite Party impli-
cated for hazing and voter coercion in a re-
cording of a February campaign meeting.
The audio recording includes a member
of the Unite Party congratulating Delta Phi
Epsilon Sorority for not letting pledges eat
until they voted in the Student Govern-
ment election. In the video, a Unite Party
official also commends Kappa Alpha Theta
Sorority for rewarding its members with
alcohol after they voted.
The taping of the private meeting was a
violation of the Student Honor Code, saidUF spokeswoman Janine Sikes, but it has
raised concerns about SG electoral process-
es and organizational requirements.
"It's not being used as a punitive tool,"
Sikes said. "It's a learning exercise."
After the release of the tape, Sikes said
the Division of Student Affairs has held
a meeting with student organizations to
review its policies on campaign ethics,
SG processes and organizational require-
ments.
Student Alliance Senate Leader Jonathan
Ossip, who received the recording from a
house representative present at the Unite
Party meeting, said the audio is proof of
voter coercion and a corrupt system.
"If this is what's going on, then it's not a
democracy," Ossip said.Ossip said evidence of this sort of sys-
temic corruption has been brought to the
attention of administrators in the past,
but nothing has ever been done about it
because there has never
been enough proof.
Now, even after they
have it recorded, Ossip
said the administration
is still going to try and
sweep it under the rug.
"I just don't know
Gossip what they want us to
show them before they
take action," Ossip said.
Ossip said these sort of politics, con-
ducted through deals and patronage, are
not something SG should be teaching thefuture political leaders of America.
"I'm going to be pretty afraid of what
Florida politics are going to look like 15
years from now," Ossip said.
Student Body President-elect Ashton
Charles, who represents the Unite Party,
said she is focusing primarily on what
good things SG and the Unite Party are go-
ing to do in the next year.
"That's getting out there and getting
things done and being proactive," she
said.
Charles said she does not think there is
any problem with the administration re-
viewing SG and campaign processes.
"I don't ever think that it's a bad thing
to look into improving something," she
said.

Editorial
As thousands travel home to see their families, jam
chocolate eggs and marshmallow chickadees down their
gullets at a pre-diet-Oprah-like pace and put on their best
"Christ-y" faces, we present a special sugar-coated, Jesus-
juiced Good Friday edition of.
Darts & Laurels
With the weather warming up, thousands of chiseled
bro-gods and bikini bombshells will flock to sunbeams in
a desperate attempt to cook their epidermis to a golden
Snooki brown.
While we encourage self-improvement, especially for
those who need to draw attention away from deficient per-
sonalities and awkward social graces, we do not endorse
the usage of cancer caskets or spray-on mists that make
you glow like Chernobyl.
Therefore, we are chucking a we're-onto-you-Charlie-
Crist-no-man-should-ever-look that-orange DART at fake
tans. Because nothing makes the pants drop more than
skin tumors.
On a lighter note, we are thrilled that with spring comes
the resurrection of the greatest story ever told. baseball!
As players finish shaking off the rust from their swings
and steroid denials, one player kept his eye on the ball,
drilling his own mother with a foul line drive during a
spring-training game.
For this masterful display of accuracy and irony, we're
jacking a here's-for-all-those-repressed-memories-from-
little-league LAUREL at Denard Span. In a completely
unrelated story, hundreds of sons-in-law are pooling their
money together to buy out Span's contract with the Min-
nesota Twins for reasons only disclosed as "spring clean-
ing.",
Speaking of baseball bats, we would feel immense plea-
sure taking a couple of hacks at master charlatan Fred
Phelps and his crew of cesspool "Christians."
We understand the rights of free speech and assembly,
but when you spend the bulk of your "ministry work"
making a mockery of those who gave their lives to defend
those rights, you need to be stoned repeatedly.
That's why we are launching a heaven-sent, we-hoped-
you-get-mercilessly-fondled-by-the-Hand-of-God DART
at the Westboro Baptist Church.
We can only hope that during your long and winding
trek down to the eleventh gayest city in the country you
happen to stumble upon some Marine barracks during
live-demolition training.
While we have our ammunition out, we might as well
keep firing at more treasure coves of terrible ideas.
With all the hot issues plaguing our city, why did the
city's all-important, dollar-draining Office of Equal Op-
portunity decide to pull the plug on the beloved ladies
night.
Whatever is to become of drunk sketchy guys whose
primary source of sexual playing-time comes from the
stumbling, incoherent sorority princess whose hair is
sprinkled with vodka and vomit.
Because of this, we are throwing a hey-honey-can-I-
treat-you-to-a-chloroform-colada DART at the city of
Gainesville.
Bottoms up.
So have a happy and safe weekend, and in the words
of the immortal Hulk Hogan: train, say your prayers, eat
your vitamins and believe in yourself.
Because watcha gonna do when the slew of Turlington
trash comes shooting for you?

here's been yet another scandal in the CatholicChurch. It seems that every few years, there's some-
thing else that comes out about a number of priests
involved in pedophilic relations and a subsequent Church
cover-up. Of course, the national media eats this up and
has something to talk about for another week.
The scandals in the Church are indubitably wrong in ev-
ery sense of the word and so are the cover-ups -though
those have pretty valid reasons -however wrong they are.
The Church is strapped for priests as it is, and I know this
from personal experience because my hometown of West
Haven, Conn., used to have two Catholic Churches with a
few priests each, but they now must share a single priest.
The situation is dire and drastic, but this does not excuse the
cover-up.
The thing that frustrates me the most about these situ-
ations is that people seem to think that these problems are
only in the Catholic Church. Catholic priests have a stigma
attached to them that they are pedophiles, that they frat-
ernize with pedophiles or that they covered up some pe-
dophilic activities. According to "Pedophiles and Priests:
Anatomy of a Contemporary Crisis," a book by Philip Jen-
kins, statistics show that Protestant ministers are involved in
many more pedophilic crimes than Catholic priests. Jenkins
wrote that between 0.2 and 1.7 percent of Catholic priests are
involved in sexual misconduct -not necessarily pedophilia
-whereas in Protestant ministers, it ranges from 5 to 10 per-
cent. Incidents like these are covered in the media, but they
don't cause a huge debate that goes on for weeks on major
news channels. They are simply reported and forgotten in
the blink of an eye.
There is a simple explanation for this: The Catholic Church
has a very visible and public hierarchy. I mean, practically ev-
ery news station around the world went to the square in the
Vatican while looking for the white smoke after Pope John
Paul II died. It is a big organization that has a figurehead, andALLIGATOR

qucrl-rs
1'-
thus, it is an easy target. Protestant re-
ligions aren't grouped under one fig-
urehead; they are instead composed
of many different belief systems and
different churches. It is much easier to
attack an organization with a single
Paul Murty leader -the pope -than one with-
letters@alligator org out a leader. To relate it to somethingwe all know very well, try to imagine
al-Qaida without Osama bin Laden as
its figurehead. It would be a lot tougher to gamier up support
against that organization without bin Laden.
However, just because there is an explanation for this
doesn't make it right. The Catholic Church has been made
fun of and criticized throughout the 2000s -which is as far
as I can remember -while other churches are seemingly for-
gotten. Perhaps the media focuses on the Catholics because
of the celibacy rules in the priesthood. And not only are the
priests violating moral and federal laws, but they are also
violating the celibacy laws. I know many Protestant groups
don't require celibacy of their leaders, so perhaps the media is
criticizing celibacy in general. Perhaps there is simply a ven-
detta against the Catholics that comes out whenever some-
thing like this goes wrong. Perhaps the media just focuses on
what it deems more important stories. Who knows?
What I know is this: The media should be treating every-
thing equally. If there is a scandal in a Protestant religion,
focus on it for a week and criticize it afterward. If there is a
scandal in any religion, do the same thing. But don't attach
a stigma to Catholics when they aren't even the greatest of-
fenders of the abuse scandals. I understand that it is wrong,
and I'm not making excuses for it at all. But I believe that it is
irresponsible for the media to target a specific group as it has
done with the Catholic Church.

I wasn't convinced about the

supposed to make reading easier
on your eyes really works as well
as they say.
That's when I realized that if
there were a device that let you do
more than just read books, it'd be
the talk of the town. That's what
iPad is.

course) will take distraction to a

Or what if you notice somebody

let others hold it like their iPads are

By next fall, everyone will have
iPad more or less on their radar.
There are a bunch of other tablet
PCs coming out this year, I hear,
and maybe one or two renegades
will buy those. But even more than
the iPhone revolution, which is re-

City bars should redeem Band of Horses concert
The cancelation of the Band of Horses concert turned the
potentially greatest exam week many of us would have seen in
years into the worst. Heaven forbid we stop cramming and let
the Adderall wear off long enough to relax and enjoy some mu-
sic. True, the Slightly Stoopid concert got a little more "stoopid"
than we all expected, but I doubt that fans would have gotten
rowdy enough during "The Funeral" to crowd surf and smoke
out the Reitz Union Ballroom. Personally, I am embarrassed
that our school feels the need to ground us for exam week
because we aren't responsible enough to attend a concert dur-
ing a study break. Don't lecture us on stress management, UF;
you've lost your credibility.
The only way to redeem ourselves at this point is for one
of the bars (that we so loyally support) to step up and host the
show. If not to be polite to the band and its already-scheduled
tour, then to show that we still rock, even if the UF administra-
tion doesn't. Coming from someone who was blown away by
their concert two years ago, we are missing out if we pass up
this chance.
We should prove to Band of Horses that "No One's Gonna
Love You" more than Gainesville does. Besides, I would rather
rock out downtown than in the Reitz any day.

People should stop moaning about 'ladies night' specials
ending
I am sick of reading the discussion about ladies night. Do
you want to know the opinion of average Joe or Lane? Who
cares? If women are concerned about being taken advantage
of, then do not drink to the point at which you cannot control
yourself. That is Safety 101. Guys who complain about free
drinks for women? Really? Are you really going to try to hook
up with a girl who is going to a club or bar just to get ham-
mered? Doesn't seem to be where you need to look for women
anyway, so why does it matter?
And to people who are militant about ladies night: Shut up
and pay -life isn't fair. If you won't fork over the cash to buy
her a drink, why are you even talking to her? And ladies, if he
won't buy you the drink, why are you talking to him?
If you ask me, they need to give free nonalcoholic drinks for
designated drivers, because that might be productive. In con-
clusion, stop bitching about irrelevant "problems" in your life
because there are much worse things that could happen. Give
DDs free nonalcoholic drinks because they are doing the World
a favor.

Shands policy keeps some students' identities secret
0 THE IDENTITY OF HIGH-
PROFILE PATIENTS ARE
SOMETIMES CONCEALED.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
Kofi Adu-Brempong is still re-
covering at Shands Cancer Hospi-tal, but the hospital's patient direc-
tory says otherwise.
Policies stemming from the
Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act lead to those like
Adu-Brempong, who was admitted
to the hospital while under police
custody, being listed under an alias.
Many circumstances can leadto a patient's admittance under an
alias.
According to Shands spokes-
woman Kim Rose,
Local some of these circum-News stances include a per-
sonal request from the
patient and a need to keep high-
profile patients or victims of childabuse anonymous.
If a patient remains in the hospi-
tal after being released from police
custody, the patient could still re-
main under an alias if the circum-
stance calls for it.
One such circumstance is the
presence of an impending investi-
gation.As the students and administra-
tors await the results of an investi-
gation by the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement, UF spokes-
woman Janine Sikes weighed in on
Adu-Brempong's recovery.
"The university certainly is hap-
py that Kofi is on his way to recov-
ery," she said.
Students celebrate Same-Sex Hand Holding day on plaza
Thursday's event was part of Pride Awareness Month
By STEPHANIE RAMIREZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Couples on the Plaza of the Americas
Thursday spelled out their feelings for one
another as part of Same-Sex Hand Hold-
ing Day.
About 60 UF students of all sexual ori-
entations took pictures from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m.
They held hands and also held up a
letter from the word "love" to emphasize
equality among people with different sex-ual preferences.
The event was part of Pride Awareness
Month, a celebration of sexuality spon-
sored by the Pride Student Union.
"I've been waiting four years for the
chance to have same-sex couples enjoy this
privilege and to provide them a safe place
where they don't have to hide how they
feel for one another," said Jason Hackett,
a fourth-year telecommunications student
and director of the event.
Hackett said he will make the pictures
into a collage spelling the word "love,"and he will paste the collage onto a Pride
Student Union banner.
Heterosexual couples also took photos.
They held hands and held up letters to
show their support for the Pride Student
Union, and more than 100 UF students
stopped by to enjoy the vegan ice cream
and Publix cake.
Jose Genao, an English junior, took a
picture grasping the hand of Matt Binder,
a UF freshman. Genao is pansexual, some-
one who displays many forms of sexual
expression, but he is tired of people tryingto define his sexuality.
"I'm sick of people guessing what I am,
like, is he straight, gay, bisexual?" Genao
said. "I'm a person.
Pride Student Union has the month
of April lined up with events for Pride
Awareness Month to celebrate sexuality
with events called "Paint Your Orgasm"
and "Queer Ball."
The Pride Student Union is a UF social,
educational and support organization that
strives to provide and maintain an open,
safe and inclusive atmosphere for lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, ques-
tioning, intersexed, allied, asexual and
pansexual UF students.
Conservatives speak at forum
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Conservative candidates from
across the state converged on the
Plaza of the Americas Thursday in
an attempt to push students to make
the "right" choices at the polls.
About 50 people attended what
UF College Republican president
Johnathan Lott described as "a non-
confrontational forum" designed to
provide students an opportunity to
meet political hopefuls as well as
spur more youth involvement into
conservative causes.
"Conservatives aren'tjustagroup
of old fogeys," Lott said. "We're out
here .We do exist."
Six candidates, half of whom are
running for the same seat, fielded
questions about their respective
platforms and encouraged students
to get politically active.
"Conservatives aren't
just a group of old fogeys.
We're out here .We do
exist."
Johnathan Lott
UF College Republican president
Remzey Samarrai, one of the
three candidates for the 22nd Dis-
trict state representative race, urged
students to "take back the campus."
"Don't put up with those lies
your liberal professors are telling
you," he said. "If they have a class of
the Federalist Papers, take it. If they
don't, demand one. If they have a
class on classically interpreting the
Constitution, take it [and] bring a
friend."
Samarrai also endorsed local
businessman Don Marsh, who is
facing City Commissioner Craig
Lowe in an April 13 run-off for city
mayor.
Marsh, who described himself asa "rags to blue jeans" story, insisted
his campaign is more focused on
winning people than winning argu-
ments.
Pointing to his experience of
running a self-employed business,
Marsh said that, if elected, he would
accept responsibility for what hap-
pens in the city.
"We have a lot of candidates who
want to dodge the blame," he said.
"I realize after three years I'm eithergoing to get all the blame, or I'm go-
ing to fix this."
For Paul Watson, a candidate for
Florida House District 11 who de-
scribed himself as a "conservative
child of God," these elections have
greater implications this time.
"Ya'll are the future of our coun-
try," Watson said. "We've got to
stop this socialism, this dictatorship,
coming down and telling us what to
do."4 *4

Gainesville mayoral candidate Don Marsh speaks in front of about
50 people Thursday afternoon at a College Republicans forum.
Workers will receive a
1-cent wage increase
ARAMARK, from page 1
Student Government senators passed a resolution in Octo-
ber advocating a pay increase and better treatment for Immoka-
lee workers.
"It seems like the students at UF were really very support-
ive and active and willing to do everything they could to make
this happen," Asbed said.
Dave Schneider, a UF political science and history sopho-
more and a Student/Farmworker Alliance member, said the
agreement will have a direct impact on the workers, which is
what students wanted.
"In a year's time, we brought a multi-million dollar national
corporation down to its knees, which is pretty cool," Schneider
said.
"It seems like the students at UF were really
very supportive and active and willing to do
everything they could to make this happen."
Greg Asbed
CIW staff member
Asbed said nobody could defend the conditions workers
faced in the tomato fields.
When CIW sat down and spoke with Aramark about the
seriousness of the issue, it was only a matter of time before they
reached an agreement.
"What we're asking for is definitely not that hard, not that
big and definitely reasonable," Asbed said.
Aramark spokeswoman Karen Cutler said the 1-cent in-
crease in wages will be distributed directly to the workers.
She said Aramark was pleased an agreement was reached,
and the two organizations had been working on the agreement
for a while.
"Our goal was to help improve the working conditions for
the workers," Cutler said.

Broken toilet floods Student Health Care Center
0 THE FIRE ALARM ALSO WENT OFF.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Staff Writer
A sickly toilet on the third floor of the Stu-
dent Health Care Center caused water to flood
through three floors of the infirmary Thurs-
day.
The areas most affected by the flood-
ing were Student Mental Health Services onthe second and third floor, Women's Health
on the second floor and the Acute Care and
Trauma Center on the first floor, said Dr. Phil-
lip Barkley, the director of the Student Health
Care Center.
Mental Health Services is rescheduling
routine patients with appointments today, but
patients with acute or urgent needs will still be
seen at the Counseling and Wellness Center in
Peabody Hall, Barkley said.
Women's Health and the Acute Care and
Trauma Center offices may reopen today. If
they do not reopen, patients will be seen in"But our plan is to keep the build-
ing open and to still see patients
in the areas that are not affected."
Phillip Barkley
director of the Student Health Care Center
other areas of the center, Barkley said.
The building's fire alarm also went off at
about 3:30 p.m. Thursday, leading patients
and staff to evacuate the building for about 30
minutes, he said.Barkley said there was no fire, but the wa-
ter from the flooding could have affected the
alarm's sensors and caused it to go off.
Despite the flooding, doctors and staff con-
tinued to see patients after they re-entered the
building.
Barkley said he was unsure how many
inches of water were on each floor of the cen-
ter, and he said he did not know the cost of the
damages.
"But our plan is to keep the building open
and to still see patients in the areas that are not
affected," Barkley said.

Seniors close out career
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
The No. 3 Florida women's tennis
team (16-2, 6-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) has depended on a mix of high-
level freshman talent and steady senior
leadership to knock off ranked oppo-
nents like FSU, Duke, North Carolina
and every SEC West school this spring.
This weekend, the Gators say fare-
well to the latter component of that dy-
namic.
Seniors Anastasia Revzina and Mar-
rit Boonstra will play their final home
match of the regular season against Ken-
tucky (2-14, 0-6 SEC) Sunday at noon.
The two were supplanted by fresh-
men Lauren Embree and Allie Will at
the Nos. 1 and 2 singles spots this sea-
son, but the move went smoothly.
"There's always a team chemistry
risk you take whenever you have terrific
freshmen play at a high level and bump
older players down," UF coach Roland
Thornqvist said. "Nas (Revzina) and
Marrit have the character, leadership,
intelligence and integrity that paved the
way for us to play friction-free this sea-
son."
With a match today at 5 p.m. against
No. 24 Vanderbilt (9-6, 4-2 SEC) coming
up first, Revzina hasn't given Senior Day
much thought yet. She couldn't single
out one home match that stood out more
than others in her four years at Florida.
Boonstra had one in mind.
"Last year we played Georgia at home
and beat them 4-3. That was a surpris-
ing, good win for us," she said.
The surprise Boonstra refers to is that
Georgia was ranked No. 2 at the time.
The then-No. 23 Gators depended onsingles wins from her, Revzina and Jo-
anna Mather in the 4-3 victory.
The upset over Georgia is part of
a current streak of 89 regular-season
home wins. It's a streak that began be-
fore Boonstra and Revzina started at UF,
and they have kept it going.
"There's a little bit of pressure to keep
the streak going, but it's easier to play
at home with this atmosphere." Revzina
said.
"There's always a team chemis-
try risk you take whenever you
have terrific freshmen play at a
high level and bump older play-
ers down,"
Roland Thornqvist
UF tennis coach
Following Sunday's match against
Kentucky, the women's squad closes out
the season with matches at Tennessee,
Georgia and South Carolina.
For the No. 6 men's team (13-2, 5-0
SEC), it's two more matches against
ranked opponents on the road before re-
turning home to close out the season.
Florida is coming off a 4-3 win Sun-
day at No. 14 Mississippi. The road trip
resumes today at 4 p.m. in Nashville,
Tenn., where UF faces No. 35 Vanderbilt
(10-7, 2-4 SEC).
No. 7 junior Alexandre Lacroix and
SEC Freshman of the Week Bob Van
Overbeek head into the match unbeaten
in SEC singles play.
The Gators will face an even tougher
challenge Sunday at 1 p.m. when they
face coach Andy Jackson's alma mater,
No. 10 Kentucky (14-6, 4-2 SEC).steven H. teys / miiigator staTT

UF aims for first ALC win
0 THE GATORS HOST No. 14 PENN
STATE ON SATURDAY.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Florida hasn't won a conference game in its
two tries this season.
The Gators hope the third time is the charm
when they host No. 14 Penn State on Saturday
at noon.
UF (7-4,0-2 American Lacrosse Conference)
lost its first two conference games on the road
but has been a more complete team at home.
The team's 6-1 record at Ronald R. Dizney Sta-
dium reflects the fact that it plays more error-
free and complete games in Gainesville.
That type of performance will be needed
against the Nittany Lions (6-3, 0-1 ALC), who
have an arsenal similar to the Gators'.
Six players have double-digit goals this
season, and one, Molly Fernandez, is PSU's
version of UF's leading scorer and assist lead-
er, Ashley Bruns.
Fernandez leads Penn State with 24 points
(16 goals and 8 assists). And at the same height
as Bruns (5-foot-2), she relies on quickness.
Florida coach Amanda O'Leary said her
defenders should be ready for Fernandez after
facing Bruns in practice, but she added that to
win, her team must contain some of the Nitta-
ny Lions' other threats, play two solid halves
and maintain composure down the stretch.
"Physically they are going to be fine, it'sjust mentally how we are going to step out
on that field, and that's going to be critical,"
O'Leary said. "They need to go out with a
sense of confidence that they can win, that
they can compete against any team, no matter
what their ranking is."
She added that having the matchup at home
is a great opportunity to get over the hump
and finally beat a conference opponent.
UF freshmen midfielders Kitty Cullen
and Colby Rhea are very familiar with Fer-
nandez. The three are best
friends. They attended The
McDonough School in Mary-
land and played together on aLacrosse club team since they were 12,
but Rhea said at the whistle's
blow Saturday, it will be all business.
"We are very competitive, and the fact is
that we want bragging rights for the sum-
mer, so we need to win this game," Rhea said.
"[Fernandez] calls me the enemy now. When
we talk, she's like, 'I can't talk to you now, be-
cause you are the enemy,' but after the game
we'll be able to talk."
Rhea said they'll have dinner together Fri-
day night, and although it'll be strange play-
ing with Fernandez as the opponent, there
will be no pass mix-ups because she knows
where her loyalty lies.
"It's about Florida on Saturday, and we
need to pull out this win for ourselves so we
know that we can beat a team in our confer-
ence," Rhea said. "I'm looking forward to our
first ALC win. We need this."0% % %

This has been a problem for
No. 8 Florida (18-6, 4-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) lately. Since start-
ing with a 17-3 record, it is going
through a rough 1-3 stretch due in
part to poor hitting with runners
in scoring position. It will try to
turn that around against No. 17
Vanderbilt (23-4, 4-2 SEC) tonight
at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium.
"I like our team, we have a
good team. We just have

three out of four games -
it's as simple as that."
Kevin O'Sullivan
UF baseball coach
"I like our team, we have a
good team. We just have not
played well the last three out of
four games -it's as simple as

said. "We knew going into this
thing there were going to be spells
where we were going to struggle

The Gators went just 5 for 26
(.192) with runners in scoring po-
sition and left 29 on base in the
last three losses. UF only left five
runners on base in the one win,
when it drove in 13 runs.
Second baseman Josh Adams
attributes those numbers to a

things where your mind is run-

he said. "You want to get them in,

UF into LSU series
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
The Florida softball team prides itself on doing the little
things well.
While so much attention is being paid to the Gators' big-
time power numbers, they are quietly tops in the Southeast-
ern Conference and fourth in the nation with a .977 fielding
percentage.
If they want to put a stop to No. 12 LSU's (29-4, 8-0 SEC)
24-game winning streak, No. 6 Florida (24-4, 6-2 SEC) will
need to be clicking on all cylinders when the Tigers visit
Gainesville for a weekend series starting Saturday at 1 p.m.
While solid performances in the circle and batter's box
will be crucial, the Gators know they can't afford to make
mistakes in the field.
"Being able to support our pitching staff is key," junior
right fielder Kelsey Bruder said. "If we get
a ground ball, we're supposed to make the
play."
The often-overlooked aspect of the sport isSoftball not neglected by the Gators, who have yet to
commit an outfield error.
That stems from the three to four hours of defensive work
the team puts in each day at practice.
"Every single day we put a lot of emphasis on our field-
ing," senior third baseman Corrie Brooks said. "We take fly
balls, ground balls to the forehand, ground balls to the back-
hand, pretty much everything."
All the work UF does on fielding is designed to make life
easier for the pitching staff. Instead of going into every at-
bat looking for a strikeout, the Florida pitchers only have to
keep their opponents from making solid contact.
"A lot of the time when I'm cheering them on I'll scream
'just get us a ground ball,"' senior left fielder Francesca
Enea said. "It makes them feel better to know they can leave
a pitch over the plate a little bit, they don't have to be so
picky."

Florida aims to use Florida Relays as launching pad for outdoor success
TRACK, from page 20
prestigious in the country.
Started in 1939, the meet has
been held every spring except for a
five-year hiatus during World War
II and a year off in 2006 due to reno-
vations at the track facility.
A creation of former UF track
coach Percy Beard, the namesake
of the school's track, the two-day
event features nearly 3,500 athletes.
Among those are post-collegiate
athletes and several-hundred high
school student-athletes from more
than 50 schools from around the
state.
The main draw of the event is
the collegiate competitions Friday
and Saturday afternoon. Seven
Southeastern Conference schools,
nine schools from Florida and teams
from as far away as Cal-State Fuller-
ton and Buffalo make up a group of
nearly 50 squads that will travel to
Gainesville for the meet.
UF coach Mike Holloway said
the agreeable weather, top-notch
facilities and ef-
fort of UF's athletic
staff to make this as
strong a meet as pos-Track sible brings teams to
Gainesville year after
year. Consequently, the relay draws
some of the best athletes and biggest
crowds.
"It's a chance to showcase to the
Gator community so I always get
excited about that," Holloway said.
"There's a lot of people in this com-
munity who put it on their calendar
and go to it every year."
Sophomore distance runner Gen-
evieve LaCaze said the passionate
crowd support gave her extra inspi-
ration last season in her first Florida
Relays, where she won the 3,000-me-
ter steeplechase and finished third in
the 1,500-meter.
"I couldn't believe how exciting
it was to have people cheering for
you," she said. "To have fans here
encourages you to put on a show
and make them want to come back

+d mNFPAagain."
While the UF's athletes are ex-
cited about the opportunity to host a
meet and compete before their home
fans, Holloway has kept the team fo-
cused on the SEC and NCAA Cham-
pionships at season's end.
"People expect us to do well,"
Holloway said. "We're not trying to
prove how good we are. We're just
trying to get a little bit better."
Geared for Success
The men are coming off a nation-
al title at the NCAA Indoor Cham-
pionships while the women, fourth
at the NCAA meet, brought home
a title at the SEC Indoor Champi-
onships. Both teams are expected
to contend for the SEC and NCAA
titles in the outdoor season.
Along with a lineup of talented
athletes, chemistry has been one ofthe keys for the Gators' success. In
most meets, when fans won't be as
plentiful as this weekend, UF's most
fervent supporters can be found
wearing jerseys.
"I think its amazing, this 'Orange
and Blue' atmosphere," LaCaze said.
"I've noticed it with football in the
fall, and it carries over to the track."
Nowhere is this team camara-
derie more important than in the
4x100-meter relay. The four-person
event requires each athlete to receive
or exchange a baton within 100 me-
ters.
That means chemistry is a must,
though taking a handoff should be
natural for Demps, who will anchor
the 4x100.
"You have to trust your team-
mates that they'll put the baton in
the right spot," Demps said. "The
4x100 runners should have one of
the best relationships on the team."The Gators took the 2009 NCAA
Championship in the event, and
Demps, Jeremy Rankin, Jeremy Hall
and Terrell Wilks expect to defend
their title in 2010.
"I think the biggest thing about
(defending the championship) is the
added pressure it gives everybody
and the will to do better," Wilks said.
"That comes with being great and it
also shows respect. There's nothing
better than being respected."
Along with the quartet in the
4x100, the Gators feature one of the
nation's best 4x400 groups with R.J.
Anderson, Tony McQuay, Christian
Taylor and Calvin Smith.
Anderson, Jovon Toppin, Pres-
ton Wilson and Carlos Phillips will
compete in the sprint medley relay
and allows UF to show off one of
the nation's most talented group of
sprinters.

The 4x100, only offered in the
outdoor season, gives the men's
team another event where it'll be a
postseason favorite, enhancing the
Gators' chances of translating their
indoor title into outdoor success.
The outdoor season also features
the steeplechase, a strength of the
women's team.
The distance runners scored the
majority of the points in UF's SEC
title, and they should only be better
in the outdoor season.
"We want to help the team out a
lot and we want to be depended on,"
LaCaze said. "It's a good feeling to
know we can help out the team."
LaCaze won't have a chance to
defend her steeplechase win from
last year's Florida Relays, but she'll
run the 1,500-meter and distance
medley relay. Senior Julie Northrup
and freshman Callie Cooper will run
the steeplechase instead.
Five Gators will compete in the
1,500, including freshman Mandy
Perkins. Perkins won the event last
weekend at the UCF Invitational
and was able to keep up with LaCa-
ze and defending indoor 1,600-me-
ter champion Charlotte Browning
in practice leading up to the Florida
Relays.
"Tuesday practice was the best
we've looked as a team," LaCaze
said.
The women's team also has se-
nior shotputter Mariam Kevkhish-
vili, who will compete for the first
time outdoors after winning every
event she participated in during the
indoor season, including the SEC
and NCAA Championships.
Senior Shara Proctor will look to
improve on her third-place finishes
in the long and triple jumps at the
NCAA Indoor Championships.
With two teams that have cham-
pionship aspirations, an early season
meet like the Florida Relays is used
primarily to prepare the athletes for
postseason.
But with a crowd of 5,000-plus,
it's anything but normal.

Clutch defense keeps UF afloat
SOFTBALL, from page 20
her own right -realizes how crucial
Florida's fielders to her success.
"I love our defense," Brombacher
said.
"They make awesome plays for me
and when I need them I know that
they're going to be there."
The defense has played a major role
in a number of key wins this season.
In UF's Feb. 21 game against East
Carolina, it was a sliding stop from
Brooks followed by a throw across thediamond from her knees that went for
the final out and preserved the team's
1-0 win.
More recently, in Saturday's 7-5 ex-
tra-innings win over Alabama, a first-
inning triple play from Brittany Walker,
Aja Paculba and Megan Bush helped
limit the early deficit to two and kept
the Gators in range for their late-inning
comeback.
The defensive gem was the pro-
gram's first triple play since April 21,
1999, when Florida accomplished the
feat against Stetson.Strikeouts plague Gators in losses
BASEBALL, from page 20
hit too."
In order to fix the problem, O'Sullivan
attempts to create these scenarios during
practices.
"We try to simulate as much as we can
when we intersquad," said catcher Mike
Zunino, who has only one hit in his last
25 at-bats. "We'll put a runner on third
with no outs or one out and we just try to
make it a game-like scenario."
Strikeouts have been a big reason for
the lack of situational hitting. Empty at-
bats that fail to move a runner over have
correlated directly with Florida's recent
struggles to bring runners in.
O'Sullivan preaches putting the ball in
play and to stay away from deep countswith runners in scoring position to his
hitters.
But they haven't done that.
The Gators have struck out an average
of 10.67 times per game in the last three
losses, way up from their season average
of seven punchouts.
"It's just another out that the defense
doesn't have to field,"
Zunino said. "If you cut
strikeouts in half and
make them field half ofBaseball those balls, anything can
happen.
"I think we are taking too big of swings.
Getting into deep counts is starting to
hurt us a little bit and I don't think we
are being as aggressive as we were during
the fall or spring during scrimmages."
