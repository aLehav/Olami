  ARLINGTON, Texas — When 
the buzzer sounded Sunday, Florida 
walked off the ﬂ  oor as Michigan guard Trey Burke dashed to the edge of the court and held up four 
ﬁ  ngers. He then huddled with his 
teammates — each decked out in Final Four gear — and celebrated midcourt. 
  For UF, the scene was all too fa-
miliar. The Gators’ season had come to a close in the Elite Eight for the third straight year.
  Michigan dominated Florida all 
afternoon as cold shooting doomed the third-seeded Gators (29-8) in their 79-59 loss to the No. 4 seed Wolverines (30-7) in the South Re-gion ﬁ  nal in Cowboys Stadium. The 20-point loss is UF’s largest margin of defeat this season. 
  “The better team won today,” 
guard Kenny Boynton said. “I really 
wish we could start the game over, 
but we can’t.”  Late-game collapses highlighted 
Florida’s last two Elite Eight losses against Butler in 2011 and Louisville in 2012, but Sunday’s contest was never close. 
  Michigan took a 13-0 lead in the 
ﬁ  rst 3:05 after burying 6 of its ﬁ  rst 8 ﬁ  eld-goal attempts and led by 19 points with 7:08 left in the ﬁ  rst half. 
  UF struggled to ﬁ  nish hook shots 
and open looks in the post. The Gators began the game shooting 3 of 17. 
  “They got off to a hot start, and 
us not being able to manufacture enough points I thought really, re-ally dug us a hole,” coach Billy Don-ovan said. “They were switching out on the perimeter.  We probably needed to have more of a presence at the basket.  I thought we got that on some drives and some post feeds, but a lot of times we weren’t able to 
convert.”
  Florida cut Michigan’s lead to 
30-15 at the 6:04 mark, but UM re-
sponded with an 11-2 run during a  FINAL FLOP

A video released by the Florida High-
way Patrol on Friday revealed more de-
tails about Mayor Craig Lowe’s March 21 driving under the inﬂ  uence arrest.
The video, recorded on Trooper Javon 
Murphy’s dashboard camera, chronicles the arrest from when Murphy showed up to the scene just after 4 a.m. until he and Lowe arrived at the Alachua County Jail at about 6 a.m.
In the beginning, Murphy is heard 
speaking with Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce deputies at the scene of the crash, located near the intersection of Northeast 
156th Avenue and Northeast 21st Street.
Murphy read Lowe his Miranda 
rights, then asked him questions about the events leading up to the crash. Lowe 
said he was driving toward the intersec-tion and fell asleep. He’d been awake since 6 a.m. the day before, he said.
As he talked to Lowe, Murphy could 
be heard saying, “I can smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting 
from your breath.”
Murphy started asking Lowe if he 
was drinking earlier. Lowe replied, say-
ing he had consumed three 12-ounce bottles of beer in Gainesville between about 8:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. He added that he was on his way to La Crosse from Monteocha.
Murphy then asked how intoxicated 
Lowe felt, to which he replied, “I’m not intoxicated at all.”

UF and the Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce will un-
veil the Collegiate Veterans Success Center on 
Tuesday in Yon Hall, Room 418.
To kick off veteran appreciation, UF Provost 
Joe Glover, Lt. Gen. John LeMoyne, Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs Dave Kratzer and Hous-
ton Bailey, a UF student veteran, will speak at 1:30 p.m. today at the Reitz Union Amphithe-ater. UF’s Collegiate Veterans Society aims to bring together collegiate veterans in the transi-tion from military to college life.
Society President Matthew Davis, 25, said 
the center will become a hub for army veterans like himself.
“We’re not traditional students, so we come 
together and form our own social group,” the business ﬁ  nance senior said.
Jen Day Shaw, assistant vice president of 
student affairs and dean of students, wrote in an email that creating the new center was a team effort.
“We had a lot of help from a lot of people, 
including a planning team from across campus consisting of students, faculty, staff and com-munity members,” she wrote.
The center will be open Monday through 
Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Shaw said the main space has a kitchenette, comfortable chairs, a big screen TV and study rooms.
“This space will provide to our student vet-
erans a place to access services, attend events like game viewing parties and workshops re-
garding translating their military service to ci-
vilian employers, study and especially have a place that is a home away from home,” Shaw wrote.UF salutes veterans with new

The Colors of Spring
UF students gather on Hume Field on Saturday afternoon to throw colored powder on one another in 
celebration of the Hindu festival of Holi. The event was organized by the Indian Student Association, Student Government Multicultural Affairs Cabinet and UF Intercultural Engagement.
April 5, 1979
UF libraries experimented with 24-hour service for the sec-
ond time. Dean of Student Services Tom Goodale said his of-fice would shoulder the $72-a-quarter cost of keeping Library West open all night during the weekends of final exams. He 
said they had plans to continue providing the service so long 
as there was evidence of demand. They would not extend the hours for more than six days because late-night library use did not justify the cost.
April 4, 1989After being reprimanded by Florida environmental regula-
tion officials for a sewage spill in Lake Alice, UF explained the cause of the spill and provided a list of steps it would take to 
prevent another mishap. The corrections included installing a 
louder alarm system, teaching Physical Plant Division employ-ees proper response and notification procedures, and altering the lift station responsible for the spill to fit state standards.
March 31, 1993Several dozen people stripped down and ran naked across 
UF’s campus. They were a part of UF’s once annual Naked Re-lay, which had to change venues each year to evade detection 
by authorities. Two runners were caught on Flavet Field and 
given orders to appear in court for disorderly conduct. One of the detained said he would do the run again even though he was “hog-tied butt-naked and put in a police car.”
March 31, 2005UF’s plans to extend domestic partner benefits to same-sex 
couples faced opposition in the Florida Legislature. Rep. Den-nis Baxley said he opposed any plan to offer benefits to the 
partners of gay or lesbian UF employees. He also said any ef-
forts made to extend benefits would make it difficult for him to support UF funding. He said the plans would be detrimental to the institution of marriage and would violate Florida law.
— KRISTAN WIGGINSdidn’t call police after the crash, 
Lowe answered that he “was fine and [he] didn’t know how long it would take the tow truck to get [there].”
Starting at the 4:40 a.m. mark 
in the video, Lowe is seen losing his balance, stumbling and hav-ing trouble following directions during a field sobriety test. After the test, Murphy arrested Lowe on DUI and property damage charges.
The last scene of the video 
shows Murphy’s car driving into the jail parking lot. Murphy ex-plained to Lowe he could either submit to a Breathalyzer test or have his license suspended for a year.
According to an FHP crash re-
port, Lowe took a breath test, and his blood alcohol content levels were determined to be .069 and .061 four hours after the crash.
Lowe entered a formal written 
plea of not guilty in his case Thurs-day. He is scheduled for a pretrial conference April 24, according to 
the Alachua County Clerk of the 
Court’s website.
Lowe is running for re-election 
against Ed Braddy in the April 16 mayoral runoff election.

Before the sun came up on Friday, a sea of 
Gators layered in orange and blue huddled 
in front of the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
At about 7:14 a.m., the “Today” show 
switched to a live spirit competition between Florida Gulf Coast University and UF. 
For about 34 seconds, UF went live in 
honor of the No. 3 seed UF men’s basketball team going up against the No. 15 seed “Cinderella” FGCU team later that evening in hopes of advancing to the Elite Eight.
UF won Friday’s game 62-50 and advanced 
to the Elite Eight.
Steve Orlando, UF’s spokesman, said he 
got the call on Thursday afternoon from an NBC producer. 
The producer said he was going to have 
a crew and students cheering at FGCU and wondered if UF could do the same.
“You’d better believe we can,” Orlando 
replied.
The live shot was to include students 
cheering, holding signs and displaying school spirit.
About 150 students made themselves 
available at 6:30 a.m. to prepare for the live shot. Attendees included school-spirited students, the Gator pep band, the Dazzlers, 
cheerleaders, and Albert and Alberta.
“I’m not used to waking up this early,” 
said Christian Pierre-Canel, a 19-year-old 
political science sophomore, “but anything for The Gator Nation.”
FGCU was dubbed the winner of the spirit 
competition by “Today” show viewers.
“They had something to be excited 
for,” said Adam Janik, a 21-year-old sport 
management senior, “and that’s great for 
them.”FGCU fans find reason for cheer

Filing tax returns just got easier for 
UF students with a free, online tax ser-
vice launched this tax season for any-one who makes less than $57,000 annu-ally.
The link, myfreetaxes.com/uwnc-
fl, provides access to H&R Block tax preparation software, said Jennifer Stojkovic, the volunteer income tax assistance (VITA) coordinator for the United Way of North Central Florida.
“It’s basically the exact same thing 
you pay for at Best Buy for $49.99 but provided for free if you go through our link,” she said.
VITA site coordinator at the Levin College of Law Josh Giancarlo said the online site is available until April 15.
The VITA program also offers free 
live tax preparation available until April 11. It is for people who make $51,000 or less annually.
Stojkovic said people who have 
complicated tax returns, such as inter-national students, may prefer live tax preparation.
Sophia Durand, a 40-year-old His-
panic linguistics graduate student from France, has used VITA to file her tax re-turns for three years at its only on-cam-pus site at the Levin College of Law.
“We’re just not sure of the terminol-
ogy to do this at home on our own,” she said.
Giancarlo said students save money 
using VITA’s live services.
“The students who work at Chick-
fil-A or at the Reitz don’t make that much money,” he said. “They don’t need to go pay someone $150 or $200 to get a return done. That’s almost half a 
week’s work.”Filing less taxing for students

UF students and faculty, in partnership with 
local residents, will host a weeklong series of 
events starting today for Gainesville’s annual Farmworker Awareness Week.
The goal of the event is to educate and raise 
awareness about local and national farmwork-er issues, said Paul Ortiz, director of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program.
“Very often, the people who do this impor-
tant work are unpaid, do not have access to good health care and their children don’t have access to good education,” he said. “We’re try-ing to bring these issues to public awareness.”
The Interfaith Alliance for Immigrant Jus-
tice, CHISPAS and UF’s Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures will host the event, with UF’s Center for Leadership and Service and UF’s Department of Housing &  Residence Educa-tion co-sponsoring.
Specific events include a Wednesday night panel at the Alachua County Library District Headquarters branch, located at 401 E. Univer-sity Ave, said Genesis Lara, executive director for Hispanic Heritage Month.
The 21-year-old UF history junior is one of 
several speakers who will discuss education among farmworker communities.
“We will be analyzing all different compo-
nents and playing clips from interviews,” Lara said. “They’re telling the story. We’re just facili-tating it.”
Ortiz said the events will bring UF and the 
broader area together in an interfaith, multilin-gual environment for a week.
“It’s a great educational opportunity, where 
we can take what we learn at UF, take it off of campus and learn from people who are work-ing in agriculture,” he said. “This will help to improve the working and living conditions that farmworkers toil under.”Farmworker Awareness Week

� IT’LL RELOCATE TO TAMPA.

Dove World Outreach Center, 
led by pastor Terry Jones, is sell-
ing its 20-acre property, which 
includes a sanctuary and a fellow-ship hall, at 5805 NW 37th St.
The property sale will allow 
the church to relocate to Tampa. The ministry is currently in nego-
tiations with Spirit of Faith about 
buying the property. Spirit of Faith has been holding services at the 
Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts since June.
Jones said he would not yet 
disclose how much he’s selling the property for.
Most of the Dove congregation 
— about 15 people — will be mov-ing to the Tampa area as well, he said.
“Basically, the people we have 
left here are the people who are very involved and will stand up for our activities,” he said.
Jones said his goals won’t 
change. He said he considers rais-ing awareness about the moral, spiritual and financial condition of 
America his mission, and he will 
keep holding rallies, conferences and demonstrations.
“We will continue with the 
same things we have done here in Gainesville,” he said.
Representatives from Spirit 
of Faith could not be reached for comment.
Scott Wright, a Gainesville city 
planner, said the ministry moving in will need a special-use permit to 
operate on the property because 
it’s zoned for single-family use. That way, he said, the city plan-
ning board can place conditions on how the property is used such 
as limiting the size of building ad-
ditions.
In the past, Dove sparked con-
troversy after members burned 
copies of the Quran on site.
Jones said one reason he chose 
to move away from Gainesville was because the goals of his minis-
try didn’t mesh with the city.
“We felt that Gainesville would 
definitely not be the place for us to relocate,” he said. “I assume many 
people in Gainesville are happy with that decision.”
Jones added he looked for a 
new location because the ministry needed to downsize.
“My main motivation is, of 
course, a financial one,” he said. “For what we do…we do not need 
20 acres. That’s way, way beyond 
what we need.”

�THE POLL TOOK RANDOM SAMPLES 
FROM 371 LANDLINE PHONE NUMBERS IN FLORIDA.
ANGELICA MARINO
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF student Andrea Conedera is afraid for her 
life when her friend drives with her knees so she 
can text.
The 23-year-old civil engineering fifth-year 
is like 95 percent of Floridian respondents who support a ban against texting and driving, according to a new poll conducted by the Bob 
Graham Center for Public Service and the UF 
Bureau of Economic and Business Research.
Emma Humphries, assistant in citizenship at 
the center, wrote in an email that this is the first time the center has conducted a public opinion poll regarding legislative issues in Florida.
Humphries wrote that in a monthly survey of 
Floridians, the center asked if people support a bill 
that would ban texting while driving.She wrote that only 4 percent of respondents op-
posed the bill. 
Both the Florida House of Representatives and 
Senate are reviewing the bill, which would create 
a ban on texting while driving. The legislation would allow local police officers to ticket drivers for texting but only if they were pulled over for another offense first.
Humphries wrote, living battleground state, it 
is not particularly common for an overwhelming majority of Floridians to agree on a public policy issue.
“Ninety-five percent support for a ban on 
texting while driving sends a clear message to legislators: ‘Floridians want this ban,’” she wrote.
The random samples were taken from 371 land-
line phone numbers in Florida. There was a 4.92 per-
cent margin of error, and the results were weighted 
by census information to get a general distribution 
of the state, according to a press release.
The survey did not include cellphone numbers.  
Sixty-two percent of all households in Florida have 
a landline and 52.5 percent have both a landline 
and wireless phone, according to the press release.
Conedera said people should support the ban 
because it is helping to keep everyone safe.
“Texting while driving is a general hazard 
that can and should be avoided,” she said. “It is 
not necessary when you can tap on a headset and 
have a conversation.”Floridians against texting and 
driving, UF survey finds

We can’t be afraid of rocking the boat
I went to Lake Wauburg to go kayaking with one of my 
friends. We rowed around for a good little while, pre-tending we were pirates, then unsuccessfully attempt-
ing to get close enough to a bird to hit it with our paddles. It was pretty enjoyable.
But then I got bored. I wondered, “What would happen 
if I rock this boat?”
I didn’t actually end up rocking the boat because I didn’t 
want my buddy to think I was a dumba--, an a--hole or worse: a dumba-- a--hole.
When we got to shore, he asked me what I would have 
done if he had tipped the boat over. He said he wanted to, just to see what would happen, but decided not to because he was worried what I would think.
So what I want to know is this: What’s wrong with rock-
ing the boat? Maybe we would’ve ﬂ  ipped over and fallen into the water, but who cares? Every unexpected event is a new adventure. Every time the boat ﬂ  ips over and you have to ﬂ  ail around in the water trying to get back right is a story you can tell the next time somebody brings up kayaking.
This just brings me to a few of my pet peeves. First is 
March Madness commercials. Some of them are good. Some are bad. I don’t care about those. I’m pissed about the ones where the ad company apparently said, “Well, this ad worked last year. Let’s just use it again.”
I’m talking about that Subway meatball pepperoni melt 
ad with the gondolier and the Reese’s ads (although more so the Subway one). C’mon, guys, what the hell?
At what point did it become OK to just recycle the same 
ads year after year? Those are the only two I could remem-ber, but I know other companies do this. These companies don’t even have the pride in their own product to say, “Nah, guys, we can’t do that. C’mon, we can think of something new.”
Why didn’t they rock the boat? Why do exactly the same 
thing over and over again when you could try something new and maybe come out of it with a great ad campaign?Related tangentially to 
my overarching theme is the seeming need by some people (I don’t know who, but they’re there) to wipe out everything beautiful in this world. You guys remember the Wild Iris mural? Key word: remember.
They painted over the Wild 
Iris mural. With orange. No, not a cool picture of an orange smoking a doobie or something. Just solid orange. And they painted over the mural by the bridge on 13th. With beige. Beige.
Who thought to themselves, “You know, I hate art and 
love solid, boring colors. How can I let the world know?”
Our generation is locked in a struggle.A struggle with those who want conformity over vibrant 
difference. People who don’t like the boat to be rocked.
Toni Morrison, in her Nobel lecture, alluded to this 
struggle. She describes the purveyors of an “ofﬁ  cial lan-guage smitheryed to sanction ignorance and preserve privi-lege” and says, “Oppressive language does more than rep-resent violence; it is violence; does more than represent the limits of knowledge; it limits knowledge.” There is no way we can defeat the hegemony of the static culture of confor-mity without rocking the boat, without testing the limits. There are people who will criticize us for stepping outside the bounds they have created and continue to uphold.
For them, conforming to a monolithic monoculture is a 
duty, and they will attempt to ostracize anyone who breaks it.
But for us, rocking the boat is a duty. We must continue 
to push against everything that tries to convince us that dif-ferent is bad. If we don’t, the bad guys win!

Why did science just 
now solve the cause? 
Did you know the Hindenburg disaster wasn’t solved 
until recently? Yeah, apparently it was a mystery for 76 
years until just now.
“The iconic airship had reportedly become charged with stat-
ic as a result of the electrical storm and broken wire or a sticking 
gas valve leaked the hydrogen into the ventilation shafts,” re-
ported the Daily Mail. “When ground crew members ran to take the landing ropes they effectively ‘earthed’ the airship, causing a spark. The ﬁ  re is believed to have started on the tail of the air-ship, igniting the leaking hydrogen.”
British aeronautical engineer Jem Stansﬁ  eld and a team of 
researchers based in San Antonio were the ones to make the dis-covery.
“Stansﬁ  eld and his team said the goal of their experiments, 
which are the subject of a British Channel 4 documentary to be aired on Thursday, was to rule out theories ranging from a planted bomb to explosive properties in the paint used on the Hindenburg,” said a report from The Telegraph.
We had no idea this was, like, an unsolved mystery. A news-
paper in New Jersey is sort of trying to take credit for the static electricity hypothesis.
“A May 2012 Star-Ledger story said that static electricity was 
one of the leading theories to explain the explosion: ‘Three-quar-
ters of a century later, an exact cause for the disaster still isn’t 
known, though theories abound. Everything from the common hypothesis that a ‘static spark’ ignited volatile hydrogen gas that had leaked, to the theory — put out in a 1975 disaster genre ﬂ  ick starring George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft — that a rigger sabotaged the airship to blow up what was becoming a power-ful Nazi propaganda symbol, complete with swastikas on its tail ﬁ  ns. Whatever caused it, the disaster essentially ended the giant airship era and provided a gloomy lead-up to World War II.’”
Like, listen, media. We’re pretty sure literally everyone 
agreed the Hindenburg was brought down by an explosion of hydrogen because that is an obvious fact. Explosions are also cre-ated by some sort of ignition.
So, don’t try to look like some sort of scientist genius just be-
cause your paper reported one year ago about the theory of static shock. Also, why is a documentary about the Hindenburg even happening at all? Are we still trying out new blimp technology?
No. We suppose we’re just solving more and more of these 
“unsolved” mysteries. We doubt we’re going to try to create the perfect blimp at this point, as there’s hardly enough money to go around the space explorations of our generation.
Not only was the explosion horriﬁ  c, but, as Time notes, it was 
also “one of the ﬁ  rst disasters to be captured in real time — on ﬁ  lm, in photos and on the radio (not to mention immortalized in Led Zeppelin album cover art).”
“Possible theories ranged from lightning to a saboteur’s 
bomb,” continued the article, “planted in an attempt to destabi-
lize Hitler’s Nazi regime.”
The documentary probably explains more about the science 
behind this discovery, but what a wide range of theories — from 
Nazi bombs to static shock.
To that end, we’re glad they discovered the real cause.

A former technological dunce in the age of Internet 
information, I have recently been coerced by a friend who works as a specialist of search 
engine optimization into participation in a number of social media forums.
My Internet visibility has since expanded from a 
simple Facebook proﬁ  le.
Now I’m on social networks including LinkedIn, 
Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest.
I soon noticed a gender disparity in activity on each 
of these websites.
I realized this division was applicable to even my 
own levels of engagement on each of these forums. 
I became deeply concerned by the division not 
only of the sites themselves but also in the quality of information exchanged in female-targeted social forums 
in relation to those geared toward male participation.
LinkedIn is a professional forum designed to connect 
members with potential employers.
It also allows means for business networking. 
Proﬁ  les on this website are designed to promote 
the talents and experiences of the user and build an impression of the user as a valuable commodity. 
Posting between members is focused on articles 
expanding upon entrepreneurship, innovation and 
expert creativity.
YouTube is a universally renowned video-blogging 
site. 
These videos represent the entire realm of social 
media exchange from how-to guides, documentaries and political commentaries, to music videos and viral 
clips of funny cats.
The use of YouTube far exceeds this brief overview. Its value as a communicative tool cannot be 
underestimated for spreading social ideas and contributing to popular culture. 
According to an infographic on the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, 
men maintain an edge for each of these forums with a relatively slight — but still signiﬁ  cant — majority of 54 
percent.
Twitter and Pinterest are the two popular forums 
that are largely dominated by women.
Twitter represents a 62 percent female majority, 
and Pinterest is overwhelmingly characterized by a 72 
percent female membership, according to the graphic. 
Twitter is characterized by its use of hashtags and a 
character limit of 140. 
It is limiting in expression of critical thought.
It aims to evoke a quick emotional expression. Pinterest is a site where 
members engage through an 
exchange of pictures.
The effectiveness of 
spreading information on this forum is based almost entirely 
on visual aesthetics, and personal commentary is often 
limited to very small captions.
Reddit is popularly considered the male version of 
Pinterest.
It has a 74 percent male lead, according to the 
graphic.  
Though this webpage is far less visually appealing, it 
is vastly more informative and opinionated in nature. 
Members post and rank a collection of trending 
stories, including a substantial amount of technological innovations, political opinions and world news 
headlines.
However, the site’s infamy for threads including 
lewd and offensive depictions of women continues to act as a deterrent to female participation.
That such a forum is considered comparable to a 
board dedicated largely to do-it-yourself home projects, fashion, health foods and feel-good stories strongly illustrates the part social media plays in deﬁ  ning and 
maintaining contemporary gender roles.
On the Internet, men still claim a large exclusivity on 
forums facilitating the exchange of political ideas and 
opinions.
This includes those that continue to objectify 
women.
Men dominate those in forums that shape our 
popular culture and that are most inﬂ  uential in the business world.
Women have no comparable sites for public 
inﬂ  uence.
 They are instead encouraged to restrict their social 
expressions on the Web to emotions and projects of domestic life with limited critical insight.
The Web is often proclaimed as a social equalizer 
through freedom of thought. 
The boundaries of social media exhibit the contrary.They clearly appeal to target gender audiences.
They create a deliberate construct through which 
these groups interact. 
Social media has become a contemporary instrument 
through which gender inequality continues to play.
Sarah Deatherage is a psychology senior at UF.Social media has continued to

Every week, conservative columnists write articles 
detailing what the Republican Party should do if it wants to preserve its popularity. Several strategists, 
including the former senior adviser and deputy chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration Karl 
Rove, have argued the GOP should cave on social issues 
like marriage equality and abortion and on immigration issues like amnesty in an effort to appeal to more voters.
But, unlike the Democratic Party, the Republican Party 
can pride itself on values and principles.
We believe in the power of the free market. We under-
stand there is a connection between political and econom-ic freedom. We say, “Ask not what your country can do for you.” (We stop there.) The left says, “Ask not.” (They 
hate to be challenged.)
To us, the scope of government is to be limited and 
dispersed. We believe the government is necessary to pre-
serve and defend individual 
freedom.  
And, despite our entire 
arsenal, we tend to forget our greatest weapon: Demo-crats.
Last week, I wrote a col-
umn about God. In response, the Alligator published a letter to the editor that was 
written by telecommunication major Matt Rubin.
(If you haven’t read it yet, read it now.)After I read it, I wasn’t surprised. I thought to myself: 
Every time I read something written by a liberal, it makes me more conservative.
Liberals are good at one thing: attacking Republicans. 
They’re effective on offense because they have to be — they suck at defense. They’re the Florida Gulf Coast Uni-versity of political parties. Show me a liberal policy they can defend, and I’ll show you a carrot the size of a cucum-ber (see my last column).
Liberal Argument Tactic No. 1: argumentum ad hom-
inem (i.e., get personal). This is a liberal’s favorite style of argument. Why? Well, their views are based on emotions 
and feelings — not logic. In Rubin’s opening remarks, for 
example, he went from dogging the Alligator to calling me out of touch because I watch (and cite) Fox News, the top-rated cable news network for 11 consecutive years. In 20 years (31 years after Fox News is still No. 1), he thinks I’ll be a “crazy Turlington preacher.”
For liberals, personal attacks are advantageous in po-
litical discourse, which is why I never argue with them. One doesn’t reason the foolishness out of the foolish. 
They’ll convert when they experience the suck of what 
they preach. 
Liberal Argument Tactic No. 2: straw man (i.e., race-
baiting). If a liberal calls you a racist (or a sexist, or a homophobe, or an Islamophobe or any -phobe), you’ve won.
But remember: Just because you defeated him or her 
doesn’t mean the debate is over. They will continue whin-ing. Like Rubin, they will create a false illusion and shift 
the conversation to another topic to deliberately avoid re-
sponding to your original point — that is, after they call you a racist. Although my argument had absolutely noth-ing to do with who literally built this country (or, more colloquially, the slaves vs. God), he invoked race in refer-ence to a column that, well, wasn’t about race.
Liberal Argument Tactic No. 3: argumentum ad igno-
rantiam (i.e., they say it’s true, ergo, it’s true). If there’s one thing science hasn’t proven, it’s evolution. And by 
evolution, I’m referring to cross-species evolution. And 
by referring to cross-species evolution, I’m discussing something that matters: faith.
Big Rubin (smirk) has every right to believe he de-
scended from an aardvark, just like I have every right to believe I was fearfully and wonderfully made by God. But evolution is merely a theory. In scientiﬁ  c jargon, it is a hypothesis. It is not a fact. Therefore, it relies on a state-ment of faith, too.
Republicans need not worry about anything. It’s the 
Democrats who should.

Size matters, especially for 
Gabriel Jimenez-Tellado, whose 
wheelchair can fit through the doors of his house for the first time.
The 9-year-old Gainesville 
resident was born with Larsen syndrome, which limits his mo-bility.
On Friday, Rebuilding To-
gether North Central Florida and Charles Perry Partners Inc. unveiled the completed renova-tions that make moving around 
his house easier.
“For him, it was tough to 
be a confined to a small space, 
to never be in the shower or be able to wheel his wheelchair around,” said Doris Tellado, Jimenez-Tellado’s mother. “He can do all that.”
Larsen syndrome is a rare 
genetic disorder that affects one in 100,000 people, Tellado said. 
The Tellado family moved 
to Florida to be closer to family and to Jimenez-Tellado’s doc-tors, Tellado said. They bought their current house, located on Northeast 43rd Terrace, with plans to remodel it to suit their needs but were never able to af-ford the necessary additions.
As a result, Jimenez-Tella-
do had limited mobility. His wheelchair didn’t fit through the doorways, so his parents and nurse had to carry him.
The family met with Re-
building Together representa-tives in 2010 to discuss plans for renovations to the house.
In 2012, the work began as 
one of the most extensive proj-ects undertaken by Rebuilding Together, said RD Bonner, ex-ecutive director for Rebuilding Together.
Workers widened the door-
ways and expanded Jimenez-Tellado’s bedroom to make his 
bed accessible from all sides. 
They also installed a lift sys-tem that can hold up to 350 pounds.
With the help of 50 workers 
and 12 professional organiza-tions, the project finished in March 10 months later.
“It’s great to give back to a 
family ... who are so active in the community,” Bonner said. 
Tellado said with the extra 
space, Jimenez-Tellado can now wheel himself to his desk or go to his brother’s room to play. 
“I feel like I won the lottery,” 
she said.Remodeling puts new 
spin on family’s lifeBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

  A look of dejection spread across Jennifer George’s 
face as she returned to the Gators’ bench with 8:25 re-
maining in the game on Saturday. 
  George fouled out after being whistled for a block and 
watched the remainder of the contest from the sideline. 
With Florida clinging to a 66-61 lead against James 
Madison, there was no guarantee the senior forward had not just played for the ﬁ  nal time during her college career. 
  But junior guard Jaterra Bonds ensured George would 
have an opportunity for redemption. 
  After James Madison reeled off six consecutive points 
to grab a 67-66 advantage with 6:47 remaining, Bonds came through in the clutch yet again. She sank four free 
throws during the ﬁ  nal 23 seconds to clinch an 85-80 vic-
tory in the JMU Convocation Center. 
  Afterward, Bonds said she was thinking about 
George, the team’s only senior, as she stepped to the foul line with a chance to ice the game. 
  Knowing George had not played up to her ability, 
Bonds wanted to give her teammate an opportunity to ﬁ  nish her career on a positive note — meaning the Gators needed another win. 
  “She started off well, but she had a pretty tough game 
throughout,” Bonds said of George. “We don’t want her season to end because she has worked so hard during her four years here.
  “In the back of my mind, I just was always thinking, 
‘I don’t want to see her season come to an end here at JMU in this type of environment with all these Gator hat-ers.’”
  After ﬁ  nishing the regular season as the team’s sec-
ond-leading scorer, George has struggled to ﬁ  nd con-sistent production during Florida’s run through the WNIT. 
  She scored just 5 points on 2-of-10 shooting on Satur-
day and collected only four rebounds. George is averag-ing 7 points during the WNIT, a number that would be lower if not for a 14-point performance against Charlotte on Wednesday.

  Florida’s pitching owned a South-
eastern Conference opponent for 
the ﬁ  rst time this season. Freshman left-hander Danny Young tossed 5.1 scoreless innings as Florida (13-16, 
4-5 SEC) defeated No. 11 Ole Miss 
(23-6, 4-5 SEC) 4-0 on Sunday after-noon at McKethan Stadium to earn its ﬁ  rst conference series win this season.
  Gators starters held the Rebels 
to three earned runs in 18.2 innings during the weekend. Junior right-hander Jonathon Crawford threw 
a complete-game, two-hit shutout 
on Saturday. Young continued the prowess on the mound in the ﬁ  rst 
c o n f e r e n c e start of his career. Soph-omore right-hander John-
ny Magliozzi followed Young and 
picked up his ﬁ  fth save, pitching 
the ﬁ  nal 3.2 innings. Florida hadn’t posted back-to-back shutouts since 2010.
  “It’s not easy to do in college 
baseball,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said of shutting out the Rebels. “To be able to do it back-to-back games against a quality team like Ole Miss 
certainly says a lot about our pitch-
ing.”
  Crawford struck out eight on 
Saturday. He attacked hitters with a mid-90s fastball and a nasty slider. Young struck out one while keep-ing the ball low. Seven of his 16 outs came on the ground.
  The Florida defense helped 
Young with its 13th errorless game.  After Young hit Austin Anderson, the second batter of the game, right ﬁ  elder Justin Shafer caught a line drive and ﬁ  red to Ramjit at ﬁ  rst to complete an inning-ending double play. 
Young settled down after allow-
ing four base runners in the ﬁ  rst 
three innings. 
Dating back to last weekend’s 
series against Vanderbilt, Young 
has given up one earned run in 11.1 innings. Although he picked up the loss, Young kept No. 5 Florida State to one run in four innings in a 2-1  Gators earn

END OF GREGULATION
  ARLINGTON, Texas— When Kenny 
Boynton and Erik Murphy started their careers, the Gators were com-
ing off back-to-back appearances in the NIT. 
  Remembering the seniors for losing 
three straight Elite Eight games as a statisti-cal favorite is natural. The Gators, like any other team, are judged on what they do in the NCAA Tournament. That’s how the sys-tem works, and none of them would argue with that. 
  Still, ignoring all they accomplished 
would be wrong. The losses end the sea-
son and stick out more than anything, but simply advancing 
to the Elite Eight three seasons in a row is commend-able. So is scor-
ing 2,033 career 
points, as Boynton did. Or ranking as one of the 20 most 
efﬁ  cient offensive players in the nation, as Murphy did in 2012-13. 
  Florida went 105-40 during their four 
seasons on campus. The program stayed at a level where NCAA Tournament appear-
ances are expected rather than celebrated.   For a program that doesn’t have a ton of 
history — UF reached the NCAA Tourna-
ment for the ﬁ  rst time in 1987 — this senior class was critical to preventing a backslide. 
  Since Billy Donovan took the job in 1996, 
Florida has never missed the NCAA Tour-nament three consecutive times. The contri-butions of Boynton and, to a lesser extent, Murphy, kept it that way as the Gators snuck into the ﬁ  eld as a No. 10 seed in 2010.
  A program coming off back-to-back na-
tional championships would never fall off the map, and Donovan would never fail to 
 Seniors should be remembered for accomplishments“She started off well, but she had a pretty 
tough game throughout.”

�RAMJIT HIT HIS FIRST HOME RUN SINCE 
MARCH 8 AGAINST INDIANA.  
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
Vickash Ramjit ended his power drought 
at an ideal time for the Gators.
The senior first baseman hit his first home 
run in more than three weeks to help power 
Florida (13-16, 4-5 Southeastern Conference) 
to a 4-0 victory against Ole Miss on Sunday 
at McKethan Stadium, sealing UF’s first SEC series win of 2013.
“It felt pretty good,” Ramjit said of his first 
home run since a 4-1 loss to Indiana on March 8. “But the win felt better.”
In the second inning, left fielder Connor 
Mitchell walked to lead off the frame and des-ignated hitter Mike Fahrman followed with a double. Cody Dent then walked to load the bases. However, the Gators came out of the inning with nothing to show for it as Casey 
Turgeon flew out to right and Harrison Bader 
grounded into a double play.
“Percentage of scoring one run (in that 
situation) is 90 percent or better,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “That doesn’t happen very often. It kind of gave Ole Miss some momen-tum.”
Catcher Taylor Gushue led off the next in-ning with a walk and then scored on a throw-ing error following a double to left from Justin Shafer. Ramjit sent a 1-0 pitch over the left field fence two batters later to put Florida up 4-0.
“To answer back right after we had bases 
loaded, nobody out was huge,” O’Sullivan said. “It gave us some momentum. We didn’t let two or three innings slip by where we didn’t score. It could’ve easily turned into that 
because when you don’t score and you have 
bases loaded with nobody out, it’s kind of lin-gering… (Ramjit) kind of erased that the next inning.”
Ramjit added a double in the eighth inning. 
He had not recorded an extra-base hit since his homer against Indiana. His last RBI that came on a hit before Sunday’s home run came in a 6-2 loss to Kentucky on March 17.
Ramjit also made multiple key plays at first 
base on Sunday. He went deep into foul terri-tory in right field to catch a foul ball in the third inning and made a diving stop on a grounder and threw to Johnny Magliozzi, who was cov-ering first base, to end the game.
“We take over 100 ground balls a day,” 
Ramjit said. “Defense is a big part of our game.”
Fahrman Seizing Opportunity: Freshman 
designated hitter Mike Fahrman didn’t have a hit through the first 26 games of the season.  After Florida’s two wins this weekend, he is swinging one of the hottest bats on the team.
Fahrman started just one game prior to the 
Ole Miss series, but O’Sullivan put him in at DH on Saturday and Sunday.

The Gators were well on their 
way to sweeping Sunday’s double-
header and the weekend series from the Rebels in Oxford, Miss., on Sun-day. Then the rain started.
Inclement weather had already 
forced Saturday’s game into a Sun-day morning start and caused the field to be covered between the two games on Sunday.But the weather nearly cost UF 
a game. Starter Alyssa Bache began the game with four innings of shut-out ball before giving up six runs in a rainy fifth frame.
“It started downpouring when 
I got out there,” Bache said. “The mound was slippery, it was wet, 
I couldn’t really get a grip on the 
ball, but I was trying to do the best I could.”
The sophomore saw her ERA rise 
from 0.79 to 1.78 as the No. 3 Gators (35-3, 10-2 Southeastern Conference) held on to win 8-7 in the second game of Sunday’s doubleheader against the Rebels (19-20, 1-11 SEC).
“I think the rain and the situa-
tion did affect the game,” coach Tim Walton said. “Thankfully, it didn’t affect the outcome.”Florida jumped out to an early 
lead in the final game of the series, scoring a run on a sacrifice fly from sophomore Briana Little. UF tacked on three more in the third on a home run from Taylor Schwarz.
The Gators looked to have the 
game in hand, as the Rebels had 
only scored one run in the series at 
that point. Florida added four in the top of the fifth on a home run from Little, a throwing error by Ole Miss catcher Natalie Martinez and a sin-gle by Kelsey Stewart.
With the Gators three outs away 
from run-ruling the Rebels, Ole Miss turned on the offense.
The Rebels scored two runs on 
base hits by Brittany Broome and Haley Culley before capping the in-ning with a grand slam from Allison 
Brown.
At that point, Walton brought in 
Hannah Rogers.

Florida survives inclement weather to sweep series vs. Ole Miss
“Thankfully, it didn’t 
affect the outcome.”
Tim Walton
UF coachloss on Tuesday. 
The appearance gave the freshman added confidence.
“That just shows his character,” senior first baseman 
Vickash Ramjit said. “Freshman or not he doesn’t consider himself a freshman, because he is not pitching like one.”
O’Sullivan told Young at 8:30 a.m. that the southpaw 
would start Sunday’s game. Once the contest started 4 hours and 30 minutes later, his teammates backed him up with four runs before the fourth inning. 
Two errors and a wild pitch scored catcher Taylor Gushue 
in the first. After wasting a bases-loaded opportunity with no outs in the second, Florida added three more in the third. Shafer drove in Gushue on his team-leading 12th double this season. Ramjit broke a 13-game homerless streak with a two-
run shot into the left-field bleachers.
After the Gators chased Rebels starter Chris Ellis in the 
third, three relievers combined to keep Florida in check, but 
it did not matter. Young and Magliozzi buckled down and did not allow a baserunner to reach third until the eighth.
With Florida still without a consistent Sunday starter, both 
pitchers could fill the role. Young has earned a shot for an-other start. Had Magliozzi not thrown 24 pitches on Friday, he would’ve been a candidate to start the finale, O’Sullivan 
said.
Florida needed a victory in the rubber match. Adversity 
hit the Gators hard. Injuries crippled their bullpen, middle 
infield and rotation. 
Florida wasted three opportunities to take the series 
opener on Friday. Yet, Crawford and Young stepped up with their team starving for something positive.
“We’ve been waiting for a weekend to turn the corner and 
to take a big step in the right direction,” O’Sullivan said. “I 
hope this weekend will do that for our team.”

Freshman pitcher Danny Young warms up on the mound before Florida’s 4-0 victory against Ole Miss on Sun -
day at McKethan Stadium. Young allowed only one hit in 5.1 innings of work. Excluding her output against the Knights — 
George shot 7 for 10 during the game — she is 
shooting just 25 percent during the WNIT. Dat-ing back to the Southeastern Conference tour-nament, George has shot only 35.2 percent and 
scored in double-figures just once since March 
3. 
Despite her dip in production, the Gators 
advanced to the Final Four, the furthest the pro-gram has been since losing 75-74 to Wisconsin in the 2000 WNIT championship game. 
Coach Amanda Butler credited her team’s 
willingness to battle through adversity against James Madison. With George forced to watch 
from the bench after fouling out and sophomore 
Kayla Lewis nursing an injured ankle, the Gators stole another road victory — their fourth in as many games — with only six healthy players. 
“Our team is playing with a tremendous 
amount of determination and heart,” Butler said. 
“I’m just so proud of their toughness because 
with Kayla on the bench with her ankle swelling 
up and Jennifer having to play with four fouls 
before fouling out … it was a tremendous dis-play of toughness and will.”
Florida will travel to Philadelphia to face 
Drexel on Wednesday at 7 p.m. for a spot in the WNIT championship game. 
“It don’t matter who they put in front of us,” 
Bonds said. “We just want to come out with a win.”

WhoopS , from page 13 Florida will 
face Drexel on Wednesdayrecruit. But a streak of four or five NIT appear-
ances wouldn’t have helped Florida’s attempt to permanently establish itself as a national power. 
Boynton is Florida’s all-time leader in 
missed threes, and he certainly didn’t come up “clutch” during a small sample of late-game moments. But he’s also UF’s all-time leader in makes and a player that was among Florida’s leading scorers for four consecutive seasons. His career three-point shooting percentage of 34 is right at the national average. He defended well and never turned the ball over. 
Murphy played the worst game of his life 
on Sunday, but he made Florida’s offense go all season. He ranked seventh nationally in ef-fective field-goal percentage and was a deadly sharpshooter from outside. After coming off the bench for two seasons and being arrest-ed for third-degree felony burglary after his sophomore year, Murphy started and was a consistent scoring threat for two seasons. His three-point shooting completely changed UF’s 
offense. He’s played through a flu and broken 
ribs, delivering some of his best games under the most averse circumstances. 
Even Mike Rosario, most famous for his 
mental lapses that led to some outstanding Billy Donovan sound bites, made incredible strides. His focus and consistency have im-proved dramatically, to the point where Dono-van would actually play him and trust him in 
key moments. 
After Sunday’s loss, Rosario reflected fondly 
on his career, recalling the strides he’s made 
and the things he’s accomplished after transfer-ring from Rutgers. 
Boynton also seemed to be his normal self in 
the locker room, although he said he was sim-ply hiding the pain. 
Murphy was the most visibly affected, un-
able to raise his eyes from the carpet or raise his voice above a whisper as he fought back tears. 
In reality, all three should have their heads 
held high. Maybe they never reached a Final Four, but 105 wins, three consecutive Elite Eights and a four-year stretch that keeps the program on the track to prominence is nothing to be ashamed of.      Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org.gReg , from page 13

Junior guard Scottie Wilbekin hangs his head in frustration during Florida’s 79-59 loss to 
Michigan on Sunday in Cowboys Stadium. Wilbekin had four of the Gators’ 15 turnovers.
Gators trailed by as many as 22 points during second half
2-minute span. 
Wolverines guard Nik Stauskas drained 
all six of his three-point attempts and 
scored 19 of his game-high 22 points in the first half. 
When Florida keyed in on Burke during 
pick-and-rolls and sent a third defender at him, the 6-foot sophomore found Stauskas open on the left side of the arc.   
“We noticed that he was hot early on 
in the first half,” Burke said. “We tried to continue to find ways to find him when he was open.”
Said Stauskas: “During warm-ups, I felt 
it right away. I felt it was going to be one of those days.”
The Gators responded with an 11-2 run 
to pull within 43-28, but guard Michael Fra-zier II fouled Stauskas on a three-point at-tempt before the first half ended. Stauskas made 2 of 3 free throws to give Michigan a 47-30 halftime lead — matching Florida’s largest halftime deficit this year. 
Florida cut Michigan’s lead to 11 points 
with 17:35 remaining in the second half, but the Wolverines outscored the Gators 18-8 during the next 8:50 and led by as many as 22 points in the second half. “We gave them open shots. We missed 
open shots,” guard Scottie Wilbekin said. “We had some dumb plays, didn’t make 
the right plays on offense. Didn’t play well 
on defense. And they made us pay every time.”
Florida shot 41.1 percent from the field, 
but finished 2 of 10 from behind the arc. Forward Will Yeguete and Boynton each scored 13 points for the Gators, while for-ward Erik Murphy went scoreless on 0-of-11 shooting. 
“We didn’t execute,” Murphy said. “We 
just weren’t getting what we wanted on of-fense and shots weren’t falling. They were guarding us well. It was them.”
The Woverines shot 46.2 percent from 
the field and 52.6 percent from beyond the arc. 
Michigan advances to its first Final Four 
since 1993 and will face Syracuse on Satur-
day in the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.
Boynton, Murphy and guard Mike Ro-
sario leave Florida with three Elite Eight 
appearances but no Final Four berths.
“It’s disappointing, honestly,” Boynton 
said. “To make it to the Elite Eight, some players never even make it to the NCAA Tournament. So you know, I’m proud of my team that we made it this far.”HoopS , from page 1
