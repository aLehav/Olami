UF’s Webmail will soon be a thing of the past thanks to a 
cloud-based service by Microsoft Ofﬁ  ce 365.
Although there is no set date, UF Information Technology 
hopes to begin early sign up for students by mid-July. 
The new service will include email, 25 GB of mailbox stor-
age, an integrated calendar and access to UF’s global email ad-
dress list of students and faculty. 
Reducing the university’s carbon footprint and electricity 
bill as well as providing more storage and portability for stu-dents and faculty are among the many reasons UF is making the switch to the cloud, said Tracy Gale, UFIT communications manager.
“The way that email is set up here — there are dozens of 
email services — so the time to manage that and the software needed — it is labor intensive,” she said. 
By the start of the Fall semester, Microsoft SharePoint will be-
come available, she said. It’s a program that allows many people to work on and edit a project without being in the same room.
Because the entire service is Internet-based, there will be no 
need to move projects from one device to another.
“The new system not only simpliﬁ  es the labor and staff time 
needed, it also is kind of like a one-stop shop that allows for bet-ter services and more services for students,” she said.
Microsoft Lync, an instant message service, will also be avail-
able later in the Fall. Students and faculty will be able to talk and video chat with peers or professors.
Microsoft SkyDrive Cloud storage and browser-based ver-
sions of Microsoft Ofﬁ  ce are other features that will be available afterward.
“I think this new email service will be much better,” said 
Alex Gomez, a 20-year-old UF economics and Spanish junior. “It sounds cool, and I deﬁ  nitely plan on signing up as soon as it’s available.”
The goal is to move about 2,000 students per week to the 
new email service, Gale said. Microsoft Office

Watch out while jaywalking — local police 
ofﬁ  cers may be watching.
In May, members of the Gainesville Police 
Trafﬁ  c Safety Team were near Chipotle Mexi-
can Grill at the intersection of West University Avenue and Northwest 15th Street writing tickets for crosswalk violations. Pedestrian crosswalk violation tickets start at $52.50.
Sgt. Joe Raulerson said jaywalking is a con-
sistent issue.
Gainesville has between 160 and 183 pe-
destrian crashes a year, Raulerson said. 
He said police ofﬁ  cers give tickets to rein-force proper crosswalk behavior.
“The longer we stay here, though, the 
more folks start using the crosswalk,” he said. “That’s the whole point.”
The 2012 Florida Statute 316.130 (1) states 
“a pedestrian shall obey the instructions of any ofﬁ  cial trafﬁ  c control device speciﬁ  cally applicable to the pedestrian unless otherwise directed by a police ofﬁ  cer.”
Madelyn Thiele, a 20-year-old UF math-
ematics junior, was one of the students who received a ticket.
“I thought it was kinda crazy,” she said.Thiele said the police’s efforts to encour-
age lawful use of the crosswalks are in vain because people will continue to cross streets at their convenience. 
“It’s not gonna change anything,” she said.GPD issues tickets for jaywalking near UF campus
CAMPUS
� SWAMP HEAD BEER WAS 
THE SECRET INGREDIENT.
OLIVIA LANGDON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The room was silent as an eager 
crowd circled a covered table in the 
center of the grand ballroom. All eyes watched as the announcer counted down to unveil the secret ingredient: Swamp Head beer. 
The Iron Chef Gainesville compe-
tition began at the Hilton University of Florida Conference Center.
Taste of Gainesville and HOME 
Magazine held its fourth annual 
fundraising event Sunday evening, where about 800 people attended. 
The main at-
traction was a lo-cal rendition of 
the Food Network show “Iron Chef America,” judged 
by previous winners from another popular cooking show, “Chopped.”The three competing executive 
chefs had one hour to prepare an ap-petizer, main course and dessert in-corporating locally brewed Swamp Head beer into each dish. Blueber-ries and coffee were the secret ingre-dients in previous years. 
Two-time defending champion 
Briton Dumas, executive chef at Embers Wood Grill, was up against two new contenders: Ray Leung, executive chef at Dragonﬂ  y Sushi, and Patrick Jones, executive chef at Gainesville Golf and Country Club.

Matt Smith leaving lead role in 
BBC’s ‘Doctor Who’
LONDON — Who will be the 
new Who?
The BBC says Matt Smith is 
stepping down from the lead role 
in long-running sci-fi series “Doc-tor Who,” spurring intense spec-ulation about his replacement.
The broadcaster said Sun-
day that Smith will leave after a November episode to mark the show’s 50th anniversary and a Christmas special.
The titular Doctor is a time-
traveling, extra-terrestrial Time Lord who can regenerate into new bodies. Smith is the 11th ac-tor to play the character since the series began in 1963.
Smith, who took over the role 
from David Tennant in 2010, said playing the Doctor had been “the most brilliant experience for me as an actor and a bloke.”
“Doctor Who” is one of the 
BBC’s most popular programs, of a Danube steamboat company captain.”
DPA reports such words have 
been so rarely used, however, that they’re not in the dictionary. There the longest word honor falls to Kraftfahrzeug-Haftpflich-tversicherung: automobile liabil-ity insurance.
For sale in NYC: fridge with 
morbid history 
NEW YORK — It’s a fridge 
big enough for a family of four.
New York’s Office of General 
Services has turned to eBay in an 
attempt to sell off a huge, steel morgue refrigerator now located at a Manhattan psychiatric hos-pital.
Bidding on Saturday after-
noon was up to $475 for the four-drawer unit, but that price doesn’t include delivery. Buyers have to be willing to remove the fridge themselves from the Man-hattan Psychiatric Center.
Office of General Services 
spokeswoman Heather Groll tells the New York Post that the ad is no hoax.
She says the agency does get 
unusual surplus items to sell from time to time, including barber chairs from prisons and police cars, but she doesn’t re-call a previous sale of a morgue cooler.
The auction runs through 
June 6.
Austrian drives flaming car to 
fire station 
VIENNA (AP) — Some Aus-
trian firefighters didn’t have to 
leave their station to deal with a recent alarm. The blaze came to them instead.
Fireman Roland Brandl says 
that colleagues were doing chores at the station in the town of Pre-garten on Wednesday when a car sped in with flames shooting from beneath it.
One man grabbed an extin-
guisher and doused the fire. No one was hurt.
The blaze was apparently 
caused by a cleaning cloth which was left under the hood.
State broadcaster ORF says the 
unidentified driver drove about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) to the sta-tion after a passer-by alerted him to the fire.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSand Smith’s tenure has seen the show gain new fans in the Unit-ed States, where it is shown on BBC America.
The BBC did not announce 
Smith’s replacement, but fans took to the Internet to speculate about casting of the 12th Doc-tor.
Bookmaker William Hill 
made “Being Human” star Russell Tovey and “Harry Pot-ter” alumnus Rupert Grint 10-1 favorites, followed by stage star Rory Kinnear and “Homeland” actor David Harewood.

odds on the next Doctor being female.
Cat detained on illegal 
mission at Russian prison 
MOSCOW — Inmates at 
Russia’s prisons have been 
known to bribe guards to ob-tain cellphones, but this may be the first time they have used a cat as an accomplice.
Guards patrolling a prison 
colony in Russia’s north saw a cat on the fence and it seemed to be carrying something. On a closer look, they found a few cellphones and chargers taped to the cat’s belly.
The federal prison service 
said Monday that this hap-pened on Friday at the Penal Colony No. 1 near the city of Syktyvkar in the Komi prov-ince, 1,000 kilometers (some 600 miles) northeast of Moscow.
It wasn’t clear how the cat 
was supposed to drop off its loot.
Law change kills Germany’s 
longest word
BERLIN — A tweak to state 
laws in the German state of 
Mecklenburg-Western Pomera-nia to conform with current EU regulations has caused an un-expected casualty: the longest word in the German language.
The Rindfleischetiket-
tierungsueberwachungsauf-gabenuebertragungsgesetz is no more.
The “law delegating beef la-
bel monitoring” was introduced by the state in 1999 as part of measures against mad cow dis-ease. But the DPA news agency reported Monday the law was removed from the books last week because European Union regulations have changed.

New labels on sunscreen designed to 
shine light on the effects of the sun’s rays 
will soon hit shelves.
The Food and Drug Administration re-
cently issued new regulations for sunscreen manufacturers to promote more accurate la-beling of products.
Catherine Seemann, communications 
coordinator at the UF Student Health Care Center, said knowing which sunscreen to choose can be overwhelming.
“You walk into a drugstore, and it is a 
wall — a giant wall of sunscreen products from oils to zinc,” she said, “How do you make that decision?”
One of the new labeling terms consum-
ers can look for is the phrase “broad spec-trum protection.” This means sunscreen is at least above a sun protection factor, SPF, of 15 and protects against both types of ul-traviolet light: UVA and UVB rays. Also under the new regulations, sunscreen prod-ucts that are not broad spectrum or that are broad spectrum with SPF values 14 and be-low will be labeled with a warning that says “Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert,” according to an FDA press release.
Sunscreens will no longer use the words 
sunblock, waterproof or sweatproof, accord-ing to the release.
The new labels could be the first time 
consumers will see a direct connection be-tween sunscreen and prevention of those risks, said Dr. Christina L. Mitchell, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at UF.
“Hopefully, this will make people think 
more about what they are choosing to put on their skin as a sunscreen and make them question the efficiency of what they are us-ing,” Mitchell said. “We hope that people are not overconfident in these products.”TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

The Alachua County Election Supervi-
sor told the Alligator married students had better chances of registering to vote in Ala-chua County than their single counterparts. This is because being married seemed to point toward an intent to permanently live in Gainesville. According to the Florida Constitution, a voter must be in the state for a year and in the county for six months. June 1, 1979Three women, roommates in UF’s Buck-
man Hall, took out an ad in the Alligator in search of love. The ad read: “WANTED: one of the male human species for the pur-pose of deep friendship, moderate relation-ship, must possess the following qualities: depth, sensitivity, fine taste, honesty, non-game playing, intelligence, wit, enjoys fool-ing around but not making it an olympic marathon...looks not relevant other than not excessively short or tall, not super zit-faced or extremely ugly, MCPs (male chauvinist pigs) need not apply! Must be unmarried and heterosexual.” The ad was signed with a pseudonym, Nicole. 
June 2, 1981Four men with masks mooned a UF ac-
counting class of about 150 students. They ran into the room, dropped their pants and ran out. They could not be recognized as students. The professor who was teaching the class later told her husband about the incident. Her husband commented that he was “familiar with streaking” and didn’t find it unusual.

for the service until Summer 2014, which is 
when Webmail will be retired, and everyone will be moved to the new service. Email ad-dresses will be the same, and everything in Webmail will be transferred to the new sys-tem. 
“Our Webmail is not the best,” said Will 
Hsiung, an 18-year-old UF neurobiological sciences sophomore. “It crashes very quickly, and it’s very hard to access, so this upgrade will probably make it easier to communicate and to collaborate.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 2013

Head chef from Dragonfly won
“You can’t really prepare for 
these kind of things,” Dumas 
said. “I kind of create menu ideas in my head of things that I can incorporate flavors into, no matter what those flavors are.” 
Once the secret ingredient 
was announced, the chefs met with their assistants to develop a menu and began cooking in portable kitchens set up in the middle of the ballroom. They prepared the meals with food from a fully stocked pantry in the corner of the room. 
The winning entry came 
from Dragonfly’s head chef Le-ung, who concocted rice sauteed in beer, beer-glazed fish — and for dessert, beer sorbet topped with peanut brittle.
Leung, who said his favorite 
part of the competition was “the adrenaline rush,” attributed his success to the versatility of Asian cuisine flavors. Dumas treated his loss light-
heartedly.
“I’ve had better days in the 
kitchen,” he said to a laughing crowd. 
Proceeds from the $100 event 
tickets went to Child Advocacy Center, Children’s Home Soci-ety of Florida and Tyler’s Hope for a Dystonia Cure, said event coordinator Scott Costello.
During the competition, at-
tendees also sampled food from 33 area restaurant vendors.

Gainesville Police arrested a local 
man Sunday after he allegedly hit a pe-
destrian with his car and attempted to run over three others.
Twenty-year-old Darrick Anthony 
Parker was driving west on Southwest Second Avenue about 3 a.m. when three men started to cross the road.
Filipe Antonio Hernandez, 23, tried 
signaling the car to slow down, said one of the witnesses, who asked to remain anonymous.
When the car drove by, Hernandez 
hit the mirror, one of the men said.
Parker stopped the car in the road and 
got out, according to the arrest report, and began fighting with Hernandez.
“Fists were up,” one of the men said. 
“They were swinging at each other.”
Parker got back into the car and drove 
away, but he made a U-turn and came back, one of the men said.
Parker drove onto the sidewalk to-
ward the men at about 35 miles per hour, according to the report. The men jumped behind a clump of trees and narrowly avoided getting hit.
Then, Parker drove back onto the 
road and struck Yatrik Vijaykumar So-lanki while he was running across the street. Parker did not stop to help him, according to the report.
Officers stopped Parker in the 700 
block of Southwest Fourth Avenue, ac-cording to the report, and a witness identi-fied him.
Parker told officers 
he didn’t intend to hurt 
anyone, and he said he was sorry if he did, ac-
cording to the report.
Parker was arrested on charges of a 
crash involving personal injury-failure to stop and aggravated assault. He was booked into the Alachua County Jail about 4:30 a.m.
He was later released.Contact Kelcee Griffis at kgriffis@alliga-

Summer is in full swing, 
and for many UF students, 
that means frequent trips to Lake Wauburg.
A busy summer day usu-
ally brings about 1,000 peo-ple, said Steven Whitman, graduate assistant for Lake Wauburg. The park’s major event for the season is the Climbing Wall Challenge.
The second annual chal-
lenge invites participants to climb the heights of well-known national structures on the South Shore’s climb-ing wall. 
According to the RecS-
ports website, this summer’s challenge is to climb its wall 28 times, which equals the heights of the Statue of Lib-erty, the St. Louis Arch and the Seattle Space Needle. The climbs combined equal 1,539 feet.
The challenge ends July 
21, but the first 50 students to complete it get a free T-shirt.
“Last year we had about 
100 people try it,” said Whit-man. “But only 25 actually finished it.”
Participants must reach 
the top of the 55-foot wall each time and cannot climb more than six routes in one day.
Climbers of all levels 
are able to take on the chal-lenge, Whitman said. There are 19 routes ranging from very easy to very hard. Hard walls ascend at a negative slope and easy walls ascend at a positive slope. 
Patrick Hickey, a 22-year-
old UF mechanical engineer-ing senior completed the challenge last year. 
“I climbed the Empire 
State Building,” he said. “After going out there a few times, I felt like I could com-plete the challenge if I put my mind to it. It was a fun experience.”
If there is thunder, light-
ning or heavy rain, the staff will close down the climbing wall. 
“One of the biggest chal-
lenges was getting there on a day when it was not going to rain,” Hickey said.
The challenge is not open 
to non-UF students. The climbing wall is open Thurs-days and Fridays from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. and from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
“They say Lake Wauburg 
is UF’s best-kept secret,” Whitman said. “We’re here, we’re open, and we have plenty of stuff for people to do.”Students get high at

HIGH SPRINGS — To save a 
103-year-old theater, Janet Alligood 
said it took more than just seeing. It took believing. 
When major movie companies 
announced 35-millimeter film — the type the Priest Theater in High Springs plays — would be discon-tinued by the end of the year, Al-ligood and her family knew they would need to upgrade to digital.
The $85,000 that the family set 
out to collect through an online Kickstarter campaign seemed like a looming obstacle. 
“I was actually worried because 
I was keeping track of it,” said Gary Blanton, a 58-year-old High Springs resident who takes his grandchil-dren to see movies at the Priest.
The two-month campaign, which 
opened in early April, had collected $14,000, or about 16 percent of the goal, by the end of the first month.
Alligood said her family spread 
the vision for saving the theater against the odds, and it caught on.
“Faith is believing in something 
without being able to see it,” Alli-good said. “We would tell people, ‘It’s going to happen. We’re going to make things happen.’”
During the fundraising process 
for the projector system, the Com-munity Redevelopment Agency awarded the theater $40,000 for the year to restore the exterior and the foundation of the theater. 
Jeff Stevens, an assistant web 
manager for UF Health, said he posted about the theater on Face-book and Twitter.
“I might have sent an email to a 
couple celebrities who just never re-sponded,” he said, laughing.
Last week, the campaign needed 
about $19,000, Stevens said.
But donations started to pick up 
as the final days drew near.
On Saturday, Stevens said, some-
one made a $10,000 donation.
By 7 p.m. Monday — the closing 
time of the online campaign — the theater had raised $87,472, more than enough to upgrade the projec-tor.
Alligood said she and her fam-
ily would spend Monday evening in the place they fought so hard to save selling tickets to “Star Trek Into Darkness.”

147 TOTAL VOTESBanning Manning:
Should we protect 
whistleblowers?
On Monday, Pfc. Bradley Manning finally got a day in 
court.  
After more than three years of detention, the soldier 
began his military trial — expected to take about three months. 
Manning faces more than 20 charges related to his WikiLeaks contributions between 2009 and 2010. Altogether, Manning’s efforts culminated in the largest release of classified informa-tion in U.S. history. 
To Manning’s supporters, he’s a hero. Manning’s attorney 
at law David Coombs characterized the 25-year-old as “young, naive, but good-intentioned.” 
Manning’s critics, however, see his behavior as having en-
dangered American lives and national security. His most grave charge is that he aided the enemy, al-Qaida — a crime punish-able by the life sentence. 
Before Manning was arrested, he gave reasons for his ac-
tions in an online conversation with ex-hacker, Adrian Lamo: “If you…saw incredible things, awful things…things that be-longed in the public domain, and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington, D.C. …what would you do?” 
“He believed this information showed how we value human 
life,” Coombs said. “He was troubled by that. He believed that if the American public saw it, they too would be troubled.”  
The state has not been able to point to a single person 
harmed by the disclosures in the three years since they were made public. Despite this, the prosecution will seek to prove that he aided the enemy by presenting evidence that Osama bin Laden asked for and received information given to WikiLeaks. According to the prosecution, WikiLeaks cables were found on Osama bin Laden’s computer. They say this means that Man-ning indirectly communicated with the enemy. 
Whether he is a patriot or un-American, Manning’s captiv-
ity and trial address the question of how whistleblowers are treated by the government and may set a modern precedent for how they are dealt with. Many who are concerned about the freedom of the press and the safety of whistleblowers worry that those who want to leak documents to the press will be held criminally accountable for their behavior.
Manning pleaded guilty to ten of his charges, so he will be 
facing 20 years in prison already, but the state is still following through with trying him for the other charges. 
Does the state become any safer by putting Manning away 
for even longer?
What is the status of the general ability to engage in civil 
disobedience in this country? Military trials carry with them different consequences from normal public proceedings, but what can a citizen expect from the state if he or she engages in civil disobedience?
It’s a tough call to make, but an informed public keeping 
its eyes on the government can do a lot to help push against oppressive forces. Whatever the future holds, informing our-selves is the critical first step to holding the government ac-countable.
Sometimes, that first step requires a Manning telling us 
what’s really going on behind the curtain.Your long-distance relationship will fail
The all-encompassing purpose of going to college is 
to better yourself. You get an education so you don’t have to drive the same piece-of-crap car you drove 
in high school for the entirety of your life or deliver pizzas when you’re 40. Why some don’t include the people they date in that same category of “things to be improved,” I will never understand. 
Take Jake and Jenny, for example. They have been to-
gether for about a year and recently graduated from the same high school. Jenny, who struggled in school and took her SAT hungover, plans to head off to Florida State University in the Fall. Jake, who always succeeded in his classes, will attend UF.
“We’ll visit each other every weekend,” they say to 
one another, wholeheartedly believing it. What could possibly come between them? They’re perfect for each other. They both like Mumford & Sons, going to parties and having sex. At 18 years old, what Jake and Jenny don’t realize is that tons of people listen to Mumford & Sons, probably even more people like partying and ev-eryone likes sex. The two believe they are in love, and no distance between them will ever change that belief. 
But let me be clear, that distance is most certainly go-
ing to change that. Jake and Jenny will no longer be a minute’s drive away from each other. They will not be meeting at one of their lockers for a quick make-out ses-sion before their next class. They won’t be able to go home for a quickie before they hear a parent’s car pull into the driveway and have to act like they were “just watching a movie.” And they won’t be able to party to-gether. When Jake arrives at UF he will be surrounded by thousands of girls — many will love Mumford & Sons, partying and bumping uglies. And when Jenny arrives at FSU, she will surely encounter a similar demographic of males — surely a slightly less intelligent crop than the one Jake will find at UF. 
Unfortunately for Jake and Jenny, they will attempt to keep their relationship alive. They will stand outside of par-ties and bars in their respective cities on the phone with each other, arguing because one of the last text responses “took forev-er,” and as a result, one assumes the other was certainly making out with someone. Despite the 
fighting, the accusations, the sexual frustration and being surrounded by thousands of people who would be more fun to date, Jake and Jenny will continue to make them-selves and the people around them miserable until one of them finally decides to end the relationship. When the last of your stuff has been unloaded from your parent’s minivan, your dad has reminded you for the thousandth time to look into getting him football tickets, your mom has cried an embarrassing amount and their shiny new “Gator Parent” bumper sticker becomes blurred by the distance between you and it, you are no longer the per-son you were in high school. The boyfriend or girlfriend who receives the all-moved-into-my-dorm text from you will not be the same person he or she was in high school, either. 
Some of the greatest memories of your life can come 
from the first few months of college. But I promise you that when you look back at your time spent at UF, you will not cherish the moments spent arguing with a now ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend outside of a party.
Don’t be like Jake or Jenny. As you become a more rounded, deeper person at UF, 
you will find someone with way more in common than a love for Mumford & Sons and sexual intercourse. 
And hey, if you don’t end up finding love in college, 
at least you probably had a really awesome time.

Benjamin Franklin is credited with coin-
ing the phrase, “Those who give up their liberty for more security neither 
deserve liberty nor security.” But what about trading liberty for entertainment?
Microsoft unveiled its latest gaming con-
sole, the Xbox One, on May 21. During the reveal, I was hyped for the new console — I was blown away by the EA Sports portion — but things have gone downhill quickly since then.
Aside from the Wii U and Xbox One, the 
best console name has been continued since 1991: Playstation 4. Wii U sounds like an ac-cessory to the Wii, not a new console. Xbox One would work if this was the ﬁ  rst con-sole— not the third. 
Now, let’s ﬁ  nally delve into why the new-
est Xbox will require users to give up some liberty just to enjoy the system.
Xbox One will need an Internet connec-
tion in order to play games. The second half of that sentence has no modiﬁ  ers, no “...re-quires an Internet connection except for sin-gle-player games,” or anything that would actually make sense. One plan was Xbox One to connect daily, but Microsoft backpedaled due to the justiﬁ  able outcry that developed and claims that needing to connect daily is a “potential scenario.” The liberty of being able to choose whether you want to be online evaporates with this.
So the new Xbox will need to always be 
online to play games. It could be worse. That’s not a big deal when compared to the fact that it will force users to use the Kinect, which has a camera installed to track your movements. 
Especially egregious is the fact that Xbox 
One will always be on. Not “always online” again, just “always on.” How so? One of the ways to turn on the system is to utilize Kinect’s voice recognition software. Saying “Xbox on” is one of the ways that the console can be started. That means that techni-cally, even when it’s off, the console is ac-tive, waiting for you. That either makes it gaming’s version of the overly attached girlfriend meme or Big Brother. Unplug-
ging the system solves the problem, but that this is even a consideration is worrisome.
The Xbox One is setting dangerous prec-
edents left and right, both because of the points I’ve listed and other plans that are in the works, such as a patent for Kinect to monitor the number of people watching a DVD and charging an additional fee if a limit is passed. E3 will reveal more informa-tion, but that may not be a good thing for Microsoft. That new information could  fur-ther alienate gamers. Xbox One desperately wants to be an entertainment center instead of just a console, but in doing so, it risks los-ing the audience that has stood by it for so long.
All of this said, by the time Xbox One is 
released, this could be an overreaction based on worst-case scenario speculation. The In-ternet community is extremely good about holding  game companies accountable. Final Fantasy XIV had to be remade with a new staff because the game was absolutely terri-ble. LucasArts as a game developer was shut down by Disney. 
I would contend that this was mostly be-
cause LucasArts’ reputation was destroyed after attaching its name with “Star Wars: The Force Unleashed 2” and “Kinect Star Wars,” two games that completely and utterly dis-appointed Star Wars fans because of how awful they were.

Two UF professors are joining Rob-
ert De Niro, Bruce Springsteen and John 
Glenn in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Ecology professor Robert Holt and 
anthropology professor Michael Mose-ley will be inducted into the Academy on Oct. 12. They’re the 11th and 12th members of UF’s faculty elected to the Academy since the 1970s.The Academy serves as an indepen-
dent research center that elects members to exchange and promote ideas, accord-ing to its website.
“It’s like an adult version of an honor 
society,” Holt said. 
He said his acceptance to the Acade-
my came as a surprise because he wasn’t even aware of his nomination.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando wrote 
in an email that the university is proud of the professors.
“UF is extremely fortunate to have 
such gifted scholars, and this national recognition reflects well on the entire university,” he said.UF professors chosen for

Guy Harvey is well known for his marine 
life art, popular with fishermen and fishermen 
wannabes. Perhaps less well known is his phi-lanthropy and outreach arm, the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation.
Last week, two students 
from UF Levin College of Law, Caitlin Pomerance and Alexis Segal, jointly won a Guy Harvey Scholarship worth $5,000 for their work on marine management in the Bahamas.
Pomerance, 23, said she 
grew up near the water and attended the Uni-versity of Miami as an undergraduate.
Pomerance and Segal’s roles are largely to 
create a link between locals and the people cre-ating management plans for the Bahamas so that regulation of fisheries and other resources is effective, Pomerance said. “This is really going to allow us to go down 
to the Bahamas … to meet everyone, which is crucial for long-term success in implementa-tion,” she said.
According to the recommendation letter sent 
by UF Law’s Conservation Clinic Director Tom Ankersen, they will be developing and imple-
menting a marine managed area on Long Island in the Bahamas, which is about the same straight-line distance from Miami as the closest part of the Florida-Georgia 
border.
They’re the third and 
fourth students from UF to win the award since it was 
first given in 2010, said Florida Sea Grant com-munications director Dorothy Zimmerman.
“These awards, in a very short time, have 
become very prestigious,” she said.
The other two UF students both recieved a 
scholarship last year.

 “The pitchers were really, really, really good 
this weekend,” Haeger said. “You come here and 
the pitcher, it’s their ace every single time you face them.”
The Gators were shut out in their season fi-
nale for the second consecutive year. But not all was lost.
“If you had asked me at the beginning of the 
season, ‘Could this team do this?’ my answer would have been no very early and easy,” Wal-ton said. “The team just got better … and worked hard, got stronger.”

� FLORIDA SHOT AN 857 (+17) 
OVERALL.
RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
The Florida men’s golf team had a week 
to forget at the NCAA Championships in 
Woodstock, Ga., and Alabama had one it will remember forever. 
UF put itself in a deep hole after it shot a 
291 (+11) in the opening round, and the Gators never recovered. Their 857 (+17) after three rounds was good enough for only 25th place  – far from the eighth-place cutoff needed to advance into the weekend’s match play. 
“Unfortunately, more of the same,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said in a release. “We actu-ally got off to a great start this morning. There’s a tough stretch of holes, the 15th through the 18th. I knew if we got by that then maybe we could have a special day, but those holes just ate us alive. The last nine was just so-so.”
The Crimson Tide’s Day 1 and Day 2 scores 
of 275 (-5) and 276 (-4) were good enough to offset an average third round of 282 (+2). On Day 3, it ended that portion of the competition tied for third overall. 
After defeating New Mexico in the match play quarterfinals 4-1 and winning against host Georgia Tech in the semifinals, Alabama matched up against fifth-seeded Illinois in Sunday’s match-play finals.
Bobby Wyatt’s perfor-
mance dominated match play – at one point he won seven straight holes. He clinched his 
round after only 13 holes, winning 6-5. 
Fellow junior Cory Whitsett also exhibited 
dominance on his first nine, taking the turn at 5-up. Illini sophomore Alex Burge did not go down quietly, however, closing the gap to three holes. But in the end, a missed par putt on Hole 15 resulted in a halved hole and a con-ceded match to the Crimson Tide. 
The win is redemption for an Alabama 
team that came within one hole of winning the championship last season, and the title was the first in school history for a men’s sport other than football. 
“I think (what happened last year) makes 
it more special,” Alabama coach Jay Seawell said in a release. “It makes you appreciate it a great deal more. It is so hard to even get here. This team has been on a mission, a mission, a mission. That is the leadership of [senior] Scott Strohmeyer and all of the guys on this team. It is their championships, and we won today because of them.”
Gators finish 25th as Crimson Tide wins national title
UF eliminated after two games in Indiana
the Gators in an early hole.
But Magliozzi turned his outing 
around, holding Valparaiso scoreless un-til the seventh inning, including a stretch where he retired seven straight batters.
“The first three innings, I was pretty 
uncomfortable,” Magliozzi said. “Then I got in a rhythm.”
But the Gators lost control of the strike 
zone in the seventh.
Magliozzi surrendered two singles and 
a walk to load the bases, and O’Sullivan brought in left-hander Daniel Gibson.
The junior allowed one run to score 
when third baseman Josh Tobias couldn’t control a ground ball. Gibson walked the next two batters on nine pitches to tie the game at 4.
“It just hit off my chest and kind of got 
behind me,” Tobias said. “I should have stayed down better and kept it in front to get an out, but I didn’t.”
Sophomore Ryan Harris came in to 
relieve Gibson, and the Crusaders scored the fourth run of the inning off a fielder’s choice on a ball hit up the middle.
Although the Gators trailed, they still 
had opportunities to tie and possibly win on Saturday.
Tobias got his fourth hit of the game 
in the eighth and advanced to second on a walk to Zack Powers. But pinch hitter Christian Dicks struck out swinging and center fielder Richie Martin grounded out to end the threat.
Second baseman Casey Turgeon 
walked to start the ninth, and Justin Sha-fer singled. A bunt by Vickash Ramjit advanced the runners, bringing catcher Taylor Gushue to the plate.
The sophomore was mired in a 0-for-23 
slump when he came to bat. He worked the count to 2-2 before he swung and missed a changeup down and away.The Gators’ batting leader, Harrison 
Bader, came up next with two outs and Florida’s season on the line. The freshman also got into a 2-2 count before grounding out weakly to third.
The loss eliminated the Gators from 
an NCAA Regional for the first time since 2008. Florida lost its first two games in the Tallahassee Regional that year. 
The Gators ended the season with five 
straight losses and only two wins in their last eight games.
“We saw both sides,” assistant coach 
Brad Weitzel said. “We played well against Ole Miss and South Carolina in there in the middle. We got hot; things went our way … I thought it would carry over to the second part of the season, but it didn’t.”

port.

After a five-and-a-half-hour, 
15-inning win against Nebraska on 
Saturday night, Florida had little left to give in its next contest.
Backed by a strong showing 
from pitcher Blaire Luna and timely hits from its lineup, No. 4 seed Tex-as (51-9) coasted to a 3-0 win over second-seeded Florida (58-9) on Sunday in Oklahoma City, elimi-nating the Gators from the Wom-en’s College World Series.
“We came 
out with a lot of energy, more than I 
expected,” junior Hannah Rogers said. “Everyone came out ready to fight. I mean, we just were strug-gling a little bit at the plate. But they did a great job today, Texas did.”
Offense was hard to come by 
for UF as Luna controlled the strike zone from start to finish. She tossed 141 pitches while frustrating a Gators offense that could do little with its one single.
Luna struck out 14 batters in 
seven innings en route to her 13th shutout of the season. The Long-horns senior found similar success in Texas’ 6-3 win against Arizona State on Thursday, striking out 10 Sun Devils and allowing only four hits.
“I think Blaire Luna had ev-erything to do with today’s per-formance more than anything,” coach Tim Walton said. “She was very good. She threw 60 balls. How many strikes did we swing at? And how many good pitches did we take? That’s the M.O. of a good pitcher.”
But it was the help of Texas’ bats 
that put the contest out of Florida’s reach midway through the elimina-tion game.
With one out in a scoreless affair, 
Texas’ designated hitter Kim Bruins belted a three-RBI home run over the left-field wall to put the Long-horns ahead 3-0 in the third. Rog-ers was unable to work ahead early in the count versus a Texas’ lineup loaded with power and speed. She surrendered the homer after falling behind in the count 2-1.
In the bottom half of the inning, 
Florida found itself in a position to respond to Texas’ offensive surge.
Luna hit both Briana Little and 
Kirsti Merritt with pitches, putting runners on first and second with two outs in the bottom of the third. Luna gave Florida another free pass in the next at-bat, walking Stepha-nie Tofft to load the bases and bringing up Lauren Haeger.
Haeger – with 31 extra-base hits 
on the season – failed to bring run-ners home, striking out on a pitch high and out of the strike zone. It would be the last time Florida

Florida had plenty of chances.
Fighting to continue its season, the Gators had runners on in 
every inning. They scored a run in two of them.
Despite jumping out to a 4-1 lead against Valparaiso (32-28), 
Florida (29-30) collapsed in a four-run seventh inning, losing 5-4 in Bloomington, Ind., on Saturday.
“When you get into a tournament setting like this, it usually 
comes down to an at-bat here, a pitch there, a play there,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It comes down to the little things, and we weren’t quite good enough on the little things.”
The Crusaders jumped out to an early lead against Gators 
starter Johnny Magliozzi. The sophomore – making his first start since giving up five runs to Texas A&M in the Southeast-ern Conference Tournament on May 21 – struck out the side but gave up a home run to shortstop Spencer Mahoney to put UF falls in RegionalstRAck And field

Florida’s men finished runner-
up to Texas A&M by a single point at the 2010 NCAA Outdoor Cham-pionships. 
”It was kind of a heartbreaker,” 
Holloway said.
Named after legendary Univer-
sity of Oregon and United States Olympic track coach Bill Hayward, the 94-year-old stadium is set to host its 11th NCAA Championship.
The lore of Hayward Field and 
the championship meet itself could be a distraction, but Holloway said the Gators are not thinking about it.
“They know what we expect 
from them,” Holloway said. “They know we’re here for business. It’s not about the stuff that goes on around the championship.”
“But, at the 
end of the day, it’s just a track meet. It’s on a 400-meter track just like all the other ones we run on.” 
The most sus-
ceptible to getting caught up in the 
hype are the underclassmen, but the more experienced athletes on Flori-da’s roster have led by example.
“Our senior group has done what 
the seniors before them have done,” Holloway said. “They learn as they go along ... I think the younger folks have done well because we have great leadership out of Omar (Crad-dock), Amani Bryant, Ugonna Ndu, and that whole crew.” 
Although the seniors’ impact on 
the success of the freshmen is ap-parent, this year’s crop of freshmen has exceeded expectations. Najee Glass and Arman Hall comprise half of Florida’s men’s 4x400m re-lay squad – the second -fastest team in the nation. Sophomores Dedric Dukes and Hugh Graham Jr. make up the other half.
“When we recruited that group 
of guys, we were excited about them and the fact that they could do multiple things,” Holloway said. “If the meet comes down to the 4x4, I feel really good about the four guys I put on the track”
The Gators are set to start compe-
tition at Hayward Field on Wednes-day. tThe meet runs four days, with the last day of competition on Sat-urday.
