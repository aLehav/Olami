Gainesville residents are split 
on a recent decision from the U.S. 
Supreme Court that exempts birth control options from mandated business health insurance cover-age.  
The Supreme Court announced on Monday its decision on Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores Inc., ruling that family-owned corporations aren’t required to provide insur-ance coverage for contraceptives in an effort to respect individual religious freedoms.  
Steven Willis, a UF law profes-
sor, said some corporations argued 
against requirements to provide contraceptives, 
such as the morn-
ing after pill and 
intrauterine de-
vices.     
An IUD “gen-
erally prevents conception but it can also prevent 
implantation, which would be in a lot of people’s religious views an abortion,” he said.
The Rev. David Ruchinski, a priest at St. Augustine Church on 
University Avenue, said the rul-
ing enables a family-run business 
to exercise the same rights that are 
guaranteed to everyone else under the Constitution.
“That’s why there’s the free-
dom of religion clause in the Bill of Rights,” he said.
But the court’s decision has also 
been met with heavy criticism.
“It’s an interesting time right 
now in America in regards to birth control and policy,” said Dustin 
Arceneaux, director of education 
at Planned Parenthood of North 
Florida.
Arceneaux said birth control op-
tions have a lot of positives, aside 
from conventional use, including preventing ovarian cancer and en-dometriosis. People were counting on the Supreme Court to rule in favor of the birth control options, he said.

Illegally parking at a friend’s 
apartment complex “just for a 
minute” now has an even more 
expensive consequence.
The Gainesville City Com-
mission voted 5-2 to raise the 
rates of roam towing at its last 
meeting, which raised the rate 
from $76 to $100 for light-duty vehicles.
Mayor Ed Braddy and Com-
missioner Randy Wells voted 
against the measure.
This is the ﬁ  rst signiﬁ  cant 
rate hike since 1994, when the 
roam towing rate was $70, 
Commissioner Todd Chase said.
Since then, towing compa-
nies argued, expenses have 
gone up.
At the meeting, UF Student 
Body President Cory Yeffet spoke against the decision, which was made in the last ﬁ  ve minutes of the commission meeting.
Yeffet said he would support 
raising towing fees if it were backed up with ﬁ  nancial data, but he called this jump “unsub-stantiated and arbitrary.”
He voiced concern that ris-
ing fees would “increase preda-
tory practices” of local roam 
towing companies.
“The students deﬁ  nitely feel 
that $76 is pretty high as is,” he said. “Especially compared 
to the cost of getting your car 
towed regularly if it breaks down.”
UF’s Student Senate has 
been vocal against towing fee raises in the past. They passed a resolution against rising fees in 2012, when the tow rate hike was last discussed, according to

Collin Zeng has stopped people from 
getting hit by cars before. The area of South-
west 20th Avenue near Winn-Dixie is where 
he warns people not to step into the road 
and cross.
“Ever since I moved here a year ago, it’s 
been an issue,” the 19-year-old UF biology 
sophomore said. “People were jaywalking 
all the time.”Zeng was fed up with the lack of an es-
tablished place to cross near the bus stop. First, he emailed the Gainesville City Com-
mission. After a few weeks of no reply, he 
started a petition to the Alachua County Public Works titled “Build a crosswalk near RTS Stop 810 on SW 20th Ave.”
“I met another person who emailed the 
city about it, and we found out that we both got ignored,” he said.
The Change.org petition gained momen-
tum within a few days. After the ﬁ  rst day of 
being on the site, it had 50 signatures. Within UF student leads pedestrian

A so-called “Deep Throat” bill grabbed its last 
gasp on June 29. The bill would have created cam-pus committees with the purpose of censoring ﬁ  lms and coursework before it could be presented to stu-
dents. The idea for the bill came when a University of 
West Florida professor showed the porn ﬁ  lm “Deep Throat” as an examination of how to deﬁ  ne pornog-raphy. Then-Gov. Reubin Askew vetoed the bill. 
July 3, 1984The age of underclassmen legally raging at frat 
parties came to an end by federal mandate in 1984. 
The U.S. Congress told states that if they didn’t raise 
their minimum drinking age to 21 within two years, then they would withhold funds. The governor was considering doing it to prevent the loss of $75 million in highway funds. If they didn’t get that money, they would either have to stop the expansion of the inter-state system or pull the money from elsewhere, like 
the education budget.   — KRISTAN WIGGINSTUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

There isn’t infrastructure for a crosswalk
the ﬁ  rst week it had 85.
The petition was addressed to coun-
ty transportation engineering manager 
Brian Singleton, who came up with a 
compromise.
“We reviewed the requests last 
week, and due to there not being a 
sidewalk on the north side of South-
west 20th Avenue, we can not put a crosswalk in,” he said. “The correct in-frastructure just isn’t there.”The List of Priority Projects ap-
proved by the Metropolitan Transpor-tation Planning Organization for the Gainesville Urbanized Area for the next ﬁ  ve years does not mention a sidewalk 
project for that area, either.
“A crosswalk for that area would be 
really nice,” said Sean Lan, a 20-year-
old UF nutrition junior. “That area is pretty congested, especially around 
rush hour. It takes a long time to even 
make a turn into The Estates.”
Southwest 20th Avenue is listed on 
Gainesville’s List of Priority Projects as a road operating at an unacceptable 
highway level of service, with a Level 
of Service score of F, meaning that the drive down the road is not smooth and steady.
The public works department is 
scheduled to place signs indicating pe-destrian crossing the week of July 7 on the corner of Southwest 20th Avenue and Southwest 34th Street. 
“I feel good about (the signs),” Zeng 
said. “Even if some people ignore it, at least one person will see it, and it will make the city safer.”CROSSWALK ,

“Planned Parenthood is hoping that employers will 
stand with their employees and provide them these op-
tions,” Arceneaux said.
On Aug. 1, a demonstration is scheduled for the open-
ing day of a new Hobby Lobby in Gainesville to protest the Supreme Court’s decision.
Michela Martinazzi, a lead organizer with UF Students 
for a Democratic Society, decided on Monday to hold the demonstration. She said she’s against the Supreme Court’s decision because “women entering the workplace will have their boss dictate whether or not they will have birth control.”
The 22-year-old UF alumna said Students for a Demo-
cratic Society will be joined by the Alachua County Labor Party and is reaching out to the Occupy Gainesville move-ment to participate.
“I hope this leads to more successful events and more 
people join throughout the country,” Martinazzi said. “It’s just a ﬁ  rst step to a series of reactions.”SUPREME , from page 1             SW 34th StSW 20th Ave

Bill Carlson patrolled the 14 
aisles of office supplies and furni-
ture, art supplies and picture frames of Central Florida Office Plus for 30 years.
The 57-year-old employee had 
been with the local office supply store longer than any other worker.
“I’ve known every delivery driv-
er that has come through this area, and they’re like family,” he said.
Carlson has done everything 
from inventory to deliveries to helping out on the floor.
“I’m kind of the catch up per-
son,” he said. “If people don’t get things done, I finish it up.”
He said he stayed there so long 
because it was a place where he knew he wasn’t going to have any problems. It offered job security.       As of Tuesday, Carlson was one of 21 employees who lost their job 
when the office supply store closed 
down.
The owner, 63-year-old W.T. 
Chesnut, said he hates that the store is closing. He said he was 8 years old when his father opened it 56 years ago.
“It’s a part of me,” he said.The store started as a hub for of-
fice supplies and furniture, but to students, it was the place to go for all of their art supply needs.
Chesnut said it does create a 
problem for the students and artists in the area.
“We are Gainesville’s art sup-
ply store,” he said. “We really feel that we have served a need in Gainesville and that need is going to be a little bit hard to fill.”
Joshua Giron, a 24-year-old 
UF architecture junior, said after class ended, his classmates some-times went as a group to purchase supplies because the store was so close to campus, and they couldn’t 
find the things they need at other 
stores.
“Since the summer courses are 
so demanding, we go a couple of times during the week because we have a new project every day,” he said. “It’s a very strong resource for us that we need, and without it, it’s going to be rough.”
Chesnut said he feels terrible 
about leaving a hole in Gainesville.
“We supported it for as long as 
we could afford to,” he said.
Costs went up and sales down, 
Chesnut said. Even with the sup-port of the local art community, the cost of the business was still based on office supplies and office furni-ture.
“Those sales have declined with 
the advent of both the big-box com-petition and the Internet,” he said.
Chesnut said the students the 
store served have added a lot to his life.
“We have enjoyed watching over the years kids that came in here from their first experience at buying maybe an art fundamentals kit through seeing some of their work at some of the art shows,” he 
said.
As for the employees, Chesnut 
said they should be able to find jobs 
without any trouble.
“They’re all very qualified peo-
ple,” he said. “They’re a fantastic 
group.”
The assistant manager, 26-year-
old Daniel Lehnen, worked with the store for four years. He said he does not know where he is going to go, but he is not worried.
“I feel like it’s a good opportu-
nity for myself to get something else,” he said.
Chesnut said he is thankful to 
everyone who has supported the store throughout the years.
“The most important assets 
we’ve always had are the employ-ees that work for us, the customers 
that they take care of and the ven-
dors that have done a great job of supplying us,” he said. “Those three things have made it worthwhile.”
He said he will miss all of the 
employees.
“The bottom line is we all love 
one another,” Carlson said. “We’d do anything for one another.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014

� HE FILED FOR DEFAMATION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — A Florida judge on 
Monday dismissed the defamation 
lawsuit filed by George Zimmerman against NBC and three reporters, say-ing the former neighborhood watch 
leader failed to show the network act-
ed with malice.
Judge Debra Nelson said the mal-
ice standard was appropriate because Zimmerman became a public figure af-ter he shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford in February 2012, generat-ing a national conversation about race and self-defense laws.
Zimmerman was acquitted last year 
for Martin’s shooting. He said he shot Martin in self-defense when the teen-ager attacked him. Martin was black. Zimmerman identifies himself as His-panic.
Zimmerman “voluntarily injected 
his views into the public controversy surrounding race relations and pub-
lic safety in Sanford and pursued a 
course of conduct that ultimately led to the death of Martin and the specific controversy surrounding it,” said Nel-son, who presided over Zimmerman’s criminal trial last summer.
In his lawsuit, Zimmerman said 
NBC’s editing of a story on the shooting made it sound as if Zimmerman volun-tarily told an operator that Martin was 
black. He was actually responding to 
a dispatcher’s question about the Mi-ami teen’s race. Zimmerman said the broadcasts made him seem like a rac-ist and exposed him to public ridicule and threats. He was seeking damages for emotional distress and mental an-guish.
Zimmerman also said he was de-
famed when an NBC reporter said he uttered a racial slur during the call with the dispatcher. Zimmerman de-nied using a slur and law enforcement analyses of the call have been unable to conclude what he said and so defama-tion can’t be proved on that case either, the judge said.
NBC News spokeswoman Ali 
Zelenko said in a statement that the 
network is “gratified by the court’s dis-
missal of this lawsuit, which we have always believed to be without merit.”
Zimmerman still owes his defense 
attorneys $2.5 million. Any award he could have gotten from the lawsuit was expected to help him pay those bills.Zimmerman’s lawsuit

Miss UF walked off the Miss Florida pag-
eant stage on June 21 with a crown and a 
smile that could light up a room, but after five days, the crown was no longer hers.  
On Thursday night, the Miss Florida pag-
eant officials visited 20-year-old Elizabeth Fechtel at her home in Leesburg to inform her that she was not the real winner of the Miss Florida crown, according to a press re-lease.
The real winner of this year’s pageant 
is 21-year-old Victoria Cowen, a student at Florida State University.
The mixup was related to an error in the 
vote count of the judges’ final scores.    
Fechtel was notified as soon as everything 
had been verified and confirmed by an in-dependent auditing firm, said Miss Florida executive director Mary Sullivan.
The mistake was due to a judge changing 
his mind on his score sheet, which wasn’t noticed in the initial counting of the scores, according to the Miss America Organiza-tion’s statement posted on its blog and Fa-cebook page.
Although Fechtel couldn’t be reached for 
comment, she wrote in a blog post that both the Miss America and Miss Florida organi-zations made the right and fair decision of contacting the rightful winner in her case.
“I could not be more proud of Elizabeth 
for how she has represented the Miss Uni-versity of Florida pageant and the Univer-sity of Florida as a whole,” said Miss UF Pageant Executive Director Leslie Morgan in an email. “She has handled a trying situ-ation with poise, dignity and grace and has exemplified all that Miss UF should embody 
and more.” 
Despite being dethroned for Miss Florida, 
Fechtel still holds the Miss UF crown.   
She will continue to make appearances 
and work with Florida Blue Key and the 
Miss UF Pageant and promote her platform that encourages community leadership in students, Morgan said. 
Morgan said Fechtel’s next appearance 
on campus is scheduled for the beginning of the Fall semester.
“I was Miss Florida for a glimpse, but 
more importantly, I have been Elizabeth Fechtel since day one,” Fechtel wrote on her blog. “A title does not define me. It opens doors, but it does not dictate who I am and where I am going.”Miss UF dethroned as Miss 
Florida, loses to FSU student “We really feel that 
we have served a need in 
Gainesville, and that need is 
going to be a little bit hard 
to fill.”

Late Periods: Keep calm and carry on 
I always look forward to my annual doctor’s appoint-
ment. I went to one a couple weeks ago, and it was a welcome reminder that my blood pressure is good and 
my allergies still suck. It was enjoyable, that is, until my doctor insisted on running a pregnancy test.
Sure, I hadn’t had my period for a few months, but I 
chalked that up to stress messing up my body’s cycles. I had even taken an at-home test — just to be sure.
But the chance, however small, that I might be preg-
nant sent me into a spiral of worry: What if my at-home pregnancy test was wrong? Can I really go nine months without drinking? How much do DNA tests cost? My par-ents are going to kill me. I can’t have a child. I am a child.
Despite being on the pill and using a condom every 
time I had sex, I was still worried. I might have even sent some choicely worded texts to my best friend about how “Satan’s spawn might be growing in my womb.”
In the end, I was worrying for nothing. The test came 
back negative. You’re welcome, mom and dad. My doctor said my period was just late due to lower estrogen levels caused by stress-related weight loss.
But the experience reminded me of so many other preg-
nancy scares that college-induced promiscuity has made 
too real for my friends, my classmates and myself.
If you have a uterus and you have even been near a pe-
nis, you’ve probably gone through a similar baby-related 
frenzy. Anytime my period is late, I convince myself it’s because I’m pregnant, regardless of how biologically im-possible that might be.
There are a lot of legitimate medical explanations for 
a late or missed period — stress, weight gain, weight loss and increased exercise to name a few. Conveniently, these 
are also side effects of a typical college lifestyle.
Sorry, freshmen. Now you have to wonder if your body 
is telling you you’re pregnant or if you’re just worried 
about failing organic chemistry. So, a PSA to the Summer B newcomers: Chances are, you’ll be an unwilling partici-pant in your very own pregnancy scare at least once over the next three to ﬁ  ve years.
You can tell yourself that it won’t happen, but sure enough, come your ﬁ  rst Spring Break, you’ll be taking a preg-nancy test alone in the Target bathroom. Not that it happened to me. Sorry, mom and dad.
It’s okay, though. Pregnancy 
scares happen, and they’re possi-ble no matter how much protec-tion you use. Take myself as an example: Your ﬁ  rst scare is the 
hardest. Once you get through that, you’ll learn what will best help you get through any future pregnancy freak-outs
Everyone is different, but I like having ice cream and 
a friend with me. One of my best friends never tells her partner about the scares. Everything is up to you.
If you do ﬁ  nd yourself in a pregnancy-scare situation, 
don’t panic. You’re probably still going to, regardless of my advice, but you’ll have your answer — for better or for worse — in the time it takes to go to the convenience store, pee on a stick and wait for the result.
While you’re waiting for your fate to be decided in the 
form of a thin blue minus or plus mark, consider stocking 
up on some condoms. 
If we can learn anything from these scares, it’s that pro-
tection is a must.
The only totally effective form of birth control, though, 
is abstinence. If you are having vaginal sex, however, use 
a contraceptive method to cut down on your risk, or these scares will be a monthly occurrence.
In the end, everything comes down to what the preg-
nancy test says. If you are pregnant, good luck. As the 
child-hating soul I am, I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. 
Be sure to discuss your options with your partner and a medical professional.
But if the test comes back negative? Congratulations. 
Go ahead and get “I’m-not-pregnant-so-fetal-alcohol-syn-drome-isn’t-my-problem” drunk.

ﬁ  lled with hypocrisy
Christian conservatives call the Supreme Court ruling granting three family-owned businesses the right to re-fuse to pay for certain forms of contraception for their em-
ployees based on their beliefs a victory for religious freedom. 
In actuality, it opens a dangerous precedent and ignores the 
hypocrisy of the businesses that fought for the right to deny re-productive health care resources for female employees. One of the businesses in particular, Hobby Lobby, has some inconsis-tencies worth noting. 
According to Mother Jones, “Documents ﬁ  led with the De-
partment of Labor and dated December 2012 — three months after the company’s owners ﬁ  led their lawsuit—show that the Hobby Lobby 401(k) employee retirement plan held more than $73 million in mutual funds with investments in companies that 
produce emergency contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices, 
and drugs commonly used in abortions.”
Basically, Hobby Lobby has poured millions into funding 
the contraception makers whose products they’re protesting on the grounds of religious beliefs. But wait, there’s more! Hobby Lobby also depends on overseas child labor to produce many of its goods. The Week, an online political publication, wrote, “a huge number of American companies outsource labor to China, and thus help prop up this shameful status quo. But very few of 
these American companies simultaneously trumpet themselves 
as ‘Christian businesses,’ arguing in court that providing em-ployees with health insurance covering contraceptives violates their religious beliefs.” 
Sorry, we missed the part in the New Testament where Jesus 
said, “Let the children come to me...with tacky, dirt-cheap horse-shoe candle holders they made for $9.77 per day.”
NBC stated that the burden of paying for necessary contra-
ceptive measures won’t be automatically placed upon female 
workers — women enrolled in the health care insurance market-
place may still access preventative health care services and con-traceptives. But the ruling, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg com-mented in her dissent, opens the door to a dangerous debate: How will the Supreme Court decide in the future, as a result of this ruling, which religious beliefs are “worthy of accommoda-tion”? The overwhelming criticism of the Hobby Lobby case is that it’s only a matter of time before businesses begin employing the religious freedom argument to get out of paying for vaccina-
tions or blood transfusions. 
So this message, then, is for all “Christian” business owners 
who choose to employ “religious freedom” only when it’s con-
venient: You will not get out of providing necessary health care measures for your employees so easily. American citizens are angry, and a White House spokesman conﬁ  rmed yesterday that the Obama administration is prepared to take action. 
So what can you, as a concerned citizen, do? Protest outside 
your local Hobby Lobby. A Gainesville Hobby Lobby is sched-
uled to open on 6111 W. Newberry Road, Suite B on Aug. 1, and 
already, a peaceful protest is scheduled. More information is available on the open Facebook event, titled “Gainesville Hobby Lobby Grand Opening Protest.” 
Religious freedom is, of course, a core value in our society: 
It’s the reason America was founded. But, as Nancy Pelosi said, “It’s just not her boss’ business.”TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014

America is suffering from what po-
litical scientist Greg Weiner calls “narcissistic polity disorder.” 
International developments occur be-
cause of — and in spite of — American for-eign policy. The whole world is viewed as an American interest. All foreign policy de-velopments must coincide with our world-
view because our best interest is at stake. 
This is, of course, an arrogant worldview and is outright impossible to reinforce.  
Our nation does not have the inﬁ  nite re-
sources and unrelenting willpower to keep alive this lofty ideal, an ideal that crystal-lized itself in the Cold-War era. Either way, America is all too willing to accept her jani-torial role.
With the crisis in Iraq comes the shouts 
of the interventionists for American pres-ence in the region. Their intent and criti-cisms of the president are clear, but their endgame is not. Even more muddied than 
their plan of action is their view of history. 
The war hawks believe that the wars in Af-ghanistan and Iraq would have had a dif-
ferent outcome if only the country would 
have listened to them more intently. Ironi-
cally, America is forced to accept the conse-quences of our campaigns as a 
result of listening to the hawks for too long. 
They attribute the fall of 
Iraq by the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria to the adminis-tration and their fellow citizens who want to diminish Ameri-
ca’s standing in the world.   
The contradictory nature of 
their squawking is their belief that this cri-
sis — a crisis brought about predominantly 
by an American intervention in the Middle 
East — can be solved by another interven-tion in the Middle East. There is no validity to their claims that new action would pro-duce a positive outcome. 
The roots for the Iraqi crisis can be at-
tributed to history-old conﬂ  icts between Sunni and Shiite Muslims and the Kurds. In effect, Iraq is caught up in the ﬂ  ames of a religious civil war. ISIS is a radical Sunni 
militant organization that rose to power as 
a result of the incompetence and alienation of the Shiite lead al-Maliki government. If 
our nation intervenes, which is what is like-
ly to occur, America will be caught up in a 
conﬂ  ict that has not and cannot be won. The Sunni-Shiite conﬂ  ict is 
at the center of Middle East-
ern strife. The whole region 
is at war with itself. Nothing, 
not even an erroneously de-scribed group of 300 “military advisers” can assuage the situ-ation. The sad reality is once an 
American adviser — in actual-
ity, active combatant in the re-
gion — is killed in action, the stakes will be insurmountably raised. 
This country no longer ﬁ  ghts out of ne-
cessity: Rather, we ﬁ  ght for credibility, and a battered credibility at that. For too long, our country has taken the brunt of inter-national crises for naught. Intervention in 
Somalia during the Clinton presidency did 
not better the country. Intervention from behind in Libya did not leave the country in better standing. And now we are forced into another engagement with a country we 
should have left a while ago. 
The hawks do have a point that an Amer-
ican force in Iraq would have stunted the increase in violence, though the trade-offs 
would be American lives and the participa-
tion in an unwinnable, unsolvable engage-ment for years. 
It is time that the world becomes respon-
sible for itself. America should not have a moral obligation to intervene in every con-
ﬂ  ict. Going back to the kidnappings by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Sen. John McCain was calling for intervention in a country not vital to America’s interest. Intervention 
would have been a moral decision, but the 
costs would have been too high and done too little, making it a feel-good but unreal-istic endeavor.    
The policy of our foreign affairs should 
not be narcissistic or even morally obligat-ed.  
Maturity and discretion must rule the 
day. Regional conﬂ  icts must be dealt with-
in the region. ISIS, prior to the arrival of 
our advisers, did not pose a great threat to America, compared to that of other Middle Eastern countries and Eastern Europe, all things considered. 
More harm than good will be done as a 
result of action. And our credibility is not the only thing at risk in the new Iraqi con-
ﬂ  ict.

Two weeks after adopting Archer, our eight-week-old boxer 
puppy, my boyfriend and I came home from the UF Small Animal Hospital without him.
He was our ﬁ  rst puppy, and we had 
plans for him. His illness started as kennel 
cough, a highly contagious upper respira-
tory disease that plagues dogs in shelters, and the veterinarian gave us antibiotics to treat him for it.
A week later, the kennel cough progressed to pneumonia, and 
the doctor told us that Archer would not recover. We kissed him and held his tiny paws for the last time on a metal table in an iso-lation room, while blood ran down his nose and his eyes stared blankly.
If you’re going to adopt a puppy, you need to consider every 
possible scenario beforehand. Visit veterinarians in the area before you adopt and ask questions. Ask the shelter what the dog has been eating, if it has any allergies and what warning signs to look out for. The ASPCA is an excellent resource regarding the adoption pro-cess.  
If the dog hasn’t eaten for an entire day, take it to the vet. If the 
dog is being unsocial, take it to the vet. If the dog throws up, take it to the vet. I’m sure you’re beginning to see a pattern here: If any-
thing seems remotely off about the puppy, don’t take any chances 
— just bring it to the vet.
It sounds expensive, but $200 in preventative care is easier to 
digest than $1,000 in emergency vet bills and a lifetime of heart-break.

An Ocala woman was arrested after 
trying to scam three Gainesville Wal-Mart 
stores by depositing $220 worth of counter-
feit bills onto a debit card.
Officers arrested 19-year-old Creshaun 
Michelle Cohen on charges of petit theft, using a counterfeit bill and scheming to defraud and obtain property, according to 
a Gainesville Police Department arrest re-
port. 
On Saturday, at about 4:45 p.m., GPD 
went to the Wal-Mart at 3570 SW Archer Road, where Cohen tried to deposit $200 onto a Wal-Mart VISA debit card belonging 
to Briana Hayes, according to the report.
Half of the cash was found to be coun-
terfeit. Four were $10 bills with the same serial number, another four $10 bills shared 
a different serial number and two other $10 bills also had matching serial numbers.
A search of past transactions on the card 
showed Cohen deposited $100 on the same day at about 2:39 p.m. to the same card. Ac-
cording to the report, $40 of that cash had 
the same serial-number strain. 
Police also found two additional receipts 
at a Wal-Mart located at 1800 NE 12th Ave., where Cohen deposited $100 cash onto the card on Saturday at 4:07 p.m. 
The bills also contained the same strain of serial numbers.
Cohen also made another deposit at the 
5700 NW 23rd St. Wal-Mart location with the same card on Saturday at about 3:39 
p.m., where $40 of the $100 deposit was 
found to be fake, according to the report. 
The faulty bills had the same serial num-
bers as the others. Footage from the store shows Cohen depositing the money in a transaction.
After questioning, Cohen admitted to 
getting the money from a friend, knowing the bills were fake, according to the report.
In total, $220 of counterfeit bills were 
found.
Officers booked Cohen into the Alachua 
County Jail on Saturday at 11:31 p.m. As of press time, her bond is set at $85,000.  Police accuse woman of using 
counterfeit bills at local store 
Tips for detecting counterfeit cash  
Paper:  Real bills have red and blue fibers 
embedded throughout. Counterfeit money 
has printed red and blue lines.
Serial Numbers:  Real cash has evenly 
spaced and distinctive style on its serial numbers. Counterfeit bills may have serial numbers that differ in color or shade of ink from the Treasury seal or are not uniformly 
spaced.
Portrait: Real money has a lifelike portrait 
that is distinct from the background. Coun -
terfeit cash portraits are usually flat and life-
less.

UF is now offering a vir-
tual alternative to a Cicero-
ne-led tour.
The free app, named the 
University of Florida Tour, gives virtual tours of the 2,000-acre campus and stops 
at 18 prominent locations. It came out on Google 
Play Store and Apple’s App 
Store on Wednesday. 
By the fourth day of re-
lease, it had been down-loaded 354 times, Allison 
Mondell, public relations 
coordinator for UF Informa-tion Technology, wrote in an email.
The app can give a guided walking tour using the GPS 
on a mobile device, and it 
also provides links to sched-ule an official tour.
The app developer and 
project manager were unable to be reached for comment.
 Emily Peoples, a 17-year-
old incoming health science freshman, said the app was a helpful tool.
Before her first class, she 
wants to walk around cam-pus with the app.
“I think it’s nice that you 
can see the building and have 
all the information about it 
right in front of you,” Peo-ples said.
Abhijith Chandrashekar, 
a UF alumnus, moved to California after graduating with a degree in computer engineering. 
He downloaded the app 
out of curiosity.
“It came up on my Twit-
ter feed, and I thought, ‘well it’s been awhile since I’ve 
seen the campus,’” he said.
He graduated in May of 
2012, and now, two years 
later, simply wanted to see his old stomping grounds.        
He said the app has a nice in-
terface for the most part but could have been better.
He gave it three stars 
out of five on Google’s Play store.10, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014

TALLAHASSEE — Florida will 
have 159 new laws take effect to-
day that address issues as diverse as spiny lobsters and poetry to abortion and the budget.
Among the most noteworthy are 
laws that will seek to protect children and others from the most dangerous sex offenders. The package of bills was among the first the Legislature sent to Gov. Rick Scott during the 60-day session that ended in May.
The laws are designed to keep the 
most violent sexual offenders locked 
up longer and close loopholes in a law 
that allows the state to send predators to a high-security treatment center even after they’ve finished their pris-on sentences. More offenders will be subject to potential civil commitment, and prosecutors, detectives and vic-tim advocates will be part of the team that reviews their cases.
“The sexually violent preda-
tor package was part of the broader movement to have a better child welfare system in place in the state of Florida,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar, who helped push through 
the package. “No other state in 
America has a 50-year mandatory 
minimum prison sentence for violent 
sexual offenders.”
Another law seeking to protect 
children overhauls the Department 
of Children and Families. It shifts the way the department investigates and responds to cases by clearly stating that protecting a child from abuse is paramount and more important than keeping a family together. It also pays 
for 270 additional child protective in-
vestigators to reduce caseloads and establishes a response team to quickly investigate child abuse deaths when the child had previous dealings with the system.Another law will create a state-
wide pilot program to pay for foster children’s driver’s education classes, license fees and car insurance so to better prepare them to be able to seek jobs when they turn 18 and leave the 
system.
The children of immigrants in the 
country illegally will be able to re-
ceive in-state tuition at state univer-sities after Scott changed his position on the issue. Another bill will give tu-ition breaks to honorably discharged veterans and waive professional li-censing fees for them.
Local school boards will have the 
responsibility of selecting textbooks, whether or not they are on a state-adopted list and will have to put in place policies that allow parents to object to the books they choose.
Another new law that took effect 
June 20 expands a voucher program that gives corporate tax credits to 
companies that provide money for 
poor families to send their children to private schools.
Among other laws, there will be 
increased criminal penalties for spiny lobster poachers, people leaving the scene of an accident that causes inju-ry and people who illegally sell pre-scription drugs. Electronic cigarette 
sales to minors will also be illegal in 
Florida. Another law prohibits send-ing text messages soliciting products to residents on the state’s “no sales solicitation calls” list.
And Florida will now have a 
new definition for its late-term abor-tion ban. Abortions will be illegal in Florida at any point in a woman’s 
pregnancy if her doctor determines 
that the fetus could survive outside the womb. The previous law banned abortions after 24 weeks of pregnan-cy. An exception can be made if the mother’s life is at risk.
And new laws will establish a 
Florida Tourism Hall of Fame and the position of state poet laureate to 
promote poetry in Florida.159 new laws to take 
effect in Florida today

In the countryside of Alachua, 
past the place where the street signs 
turn from green to blue, is a tiny 
one-way road leading into the Re-
tirement Home for Horses at Mill Creek Farm.
At Mill Creek, the land seems 
infinite. Miles of green grass con-tinues into a pinpoint, thousands of trees grow to the sky and 128 hors-es roam in fenced-in stables. This place is a retirement home where 
horses can live the rest of their lives 
in peace after spending years in ser-vice or neglect.
On Saturdays, the home is free 
to the public from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., 
and cars can park in the grass out-
side the entrance gate. 
It was a cloudless Saturday af-
ternoon when people of all ages 
walked through the gate, eager to 
see the horses. The air had a faint smell of manure, but no one seemed to mind the smell as they fed the horses whole carrots.
A little boy ran through the gate 
and walked up to a horse with a car-rot that was bigger than his arm.
At first, when Dakota the 
brown horse opened her mouth, the boy backed away, scared. But he tried again, stretching his tiny arm through the fence posts. He jumped, and Dakota made the car-
rot disappear in one bite. 
The boy smiled as he waddled 
to the next horse, his light-up shoes 
blinking with each step.
Mary Gregory and her 5-year-
old rescue dog, Annie, sat in the driver’s seat of a golf cart parked in the shade and watched as people walked through the entrance of 
Mill Creek, wandering from horse 
to horse.
“When you come through the 
gate as a four-legged animal, you 
meet a life of luxury,” Gregory 
said as she pet Annie’s tan fur coat. “Isn’t that right?” she said, leaning toward Annie, who panted in the heat. 
Mary Gregory grew up in Eng-
land at a time where horses in drawn carriages roamed the streets. In England, horses retired after years 
of service. She said that if she ever 
had the money, she would open up a retirement home for horses. 
So in 1983, she and her husband, 
Peter, opened the Retirement Home 
for Horses at Mill Creek Farm.
Peter Gregory unexpectedly 
passed away in March. He had vi-
sions for the farm’s future, but they 
were left unfulfilled. But he died 
doing something he loved: taking care of horses.
After his dad’s sudden death, 
Paul Gregory took three shirts, packed a single suitcase and drove from Fort Lauderdale to Gainesville. He left behind his job as a realtor to start his new life of taking care of horses.  
“This place is so addictive,” he 
said. “You stay here, look at all the land and never want to leave.” 
Last February, the Gregorys 
bought enough land to take in 28 
more horses, but the land sat un-
touched and untamed.
Gregory knew that he had to ful-
fill his dad’s vision for Mill Creek. Last Friday, workers installed a 
well. Volunteers helped clear the 
land and install a fence.
“Every day you work here, you 
can make a difference in an ani-
mal’s life,” he said, pausing for just 
a moment. “Or even someone else’s life.“
The best view of the entire prop-
erty is at the top of a hill, where 
there’s a tiny bench and a small 
tree. The spot is a memorial for Paul’s dog, Sally, who passed away a few months ago.
Whenever an animal dies at Mill 
Creek, it is buried in the Field of Dreams, and Mary plants a tree in their honor. In her lifetime, she has planted 300 trees.
Although the work is hard and 
losing animals is always sad, the Gregory family wants to continue to help horses and share what they 
do with the community.
At 3 p.m., the Gregorys close the 
gate, and people walk away smiling and laughing. They open their car 
doors, drive away and talk about the next week, when they’ll see the horses once again. 12, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014

� THE THERAPY IS UNPROVEN.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAN FRANCISCO — The U.S. Su-
preme Court cleared the way Monday 
for enforcement of a first-of-its-kind California law that bars psychological counseling aimed at turning gay mi-
nors straight.
The justices turned aside a legal 
challenge brought by supporters of 
so-called conversion or reparative therapy. Without comment, they let stand an August 2013 appeals court ruling that said the ban covered pro-fessional activities that are within the state’s authority to regulate and 
doesn’t violate the free speech rights 
of licensed counselors and patients seeking treatment.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals ruled last year that California lawmakers properly showed that therapies designed to change sexual orientation for those under the age of 18 were outside the scientific main-
stream and have been disavowed by 
most major medical groups as un-proven and potentially dangerous.“The Supreme Court has cement 
shut any possible opening to allow fur-ther psychological child abuse in Cali-fornia,” state Sen. Ted Lieu, the law’s sponsor, said Monday. “The Court’s refusal to accept the appeal of extreme 
ideological therapists who practice the 
quackery of gay conversion therapy is a victory for child welfare, science and basic humane principles.”
The law says professional thera-
pists and counselors who use treat-ments designed to eliminate or reduce same-sex attractions in their patients would be engaging in unprofessional 
conduct and subject to discipline by 
state licensing boards. 
Liberty Counsel, a Christian legal 
aid group, had challenged the law, as did other supporters of the thera-py. They argue that lawmakers have no scientific proof the therapy does harm.
Meanwhile, the Texas Republican 
Party this month endorsed reparative 
therapy, adopting policy language rec-
ognizing “the legitimacy and efficacy of counseling, which offers reparative therapy and treatment for those pa-tients seeking healing and wholeness from their homosexual lifestyle.”Supreme Court bans

Alachua County residents 
and the Florida Fish and Wild-
life Conservation Commission 
disagree about what is to blame for recent bear sightings around 
the Barr Hammock Preserve.  
Conservationists and resi-
dents living near the preserve blame the sightings on a surge 
of visitors coming to the area. But the FWC said it’s the  resi-
dents who are likely attracting 
bears into their neighborhoods.
Barr Hammock Preserve — 
located just north of the Alach-
ua County and Marion County 
line, near Paynes Prairie Pre-serve State Park — is home to 
many different kinds of wild-
life, including Florida black bears. But recently, residents 
living nearby the preserve said 
they have seen bears and signs of bears in their neighborhood. 
Sandy Douglas, 60, who 
lives near Barr Hammock, said a bear destroyed her bird feeder 
and knocked over garbage cans 
throughout her neighborhood.“If you live in this area, 
that’s something you have to live with,” Douglas said. 
Her feeder was mounted on 
a pole, but she said the pole was completely bent over and the feeder was smashed in half. She 
said she hasn’t put the feeder 
back up, but when she does, she won’t leave it out at night any-
more. 
Denisse Abreau, a 35-year-
old who also lives near Barr 
Hammock Preserve, said she believes the recreational part of 
the preserve needs to be shut 
down.
After sundown about a 
month ago, she came home to a bear rummaging through her garbage in her driveway. After 
hiding in her home until it left, 
she came outside and found her recycling bins scattered around 
her yard.Her neighbor, Marc Meisel 
said when Barr Hammock Pre-
serve’s sole focus was conserva-tion, there were no bear issues 
at all. But since the preserve 
placed added emphasis on rec-reation, the constant human 
contact with bears has caused 
them to start entering neighbor-hoods. 
Christin Burford, the director 
of the Creating Animal Respect Education Foundation, said that 
is exactly what is happening.
She said residents have ex-
pressed concerns to the county, but no action has yet been taken 
to resolve the issue. 
“At least take the neighbors 
seriously,” she said.
However, Karen Parker, a 
spokeswoman for the FWC, 
said biologists believe human 
traffic would not drive the bears into neighborhoods.
Instead, she said the bears 
were likely attracted to bird feeders and garbage left by resi-
dents.
“If you have ‘attractives’ in 
your yard, guess what? Bears will come,” she said.Alachua locals dispute reasons 
behind recent bear sightings

area, that’s something 
you have to live with.”

Tyler Murphy may no 
longer be a Gator, but alligatorSports looks back at his best game at UF on page 19.
UF places second in Learfield Cup
The Florida athletics program finished second for the 
fifth time, and has finished in the top-10 in each of the last 31 national all-sports standings.JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer
@J_McPherson1126
When the 2014 NBA Draft was all said and done on Thurs-
day, not one Gator was selected.
Not Patric Young, a projected mid-second round pick and 
the No. 36 prospect on ESPN’s Chad Ford’s Top 100 list.
Not Scottie Wilbekin, the reigning Southeastern Conference 
Player of the Year and a third-team All-American selection.
Not Casey Prather or Will Yeguete, who along with Young 
and Wilbekin combined for 120 career wins as a group and fin-
ished their collegiate campaigns with a Final Four berth.
Despite it being the first year since 2010 without a UF player 
being selected, three former Gators landed spots on NBA sum-mer league teams with the hope to latch onto a roster spot.
Young accepted an invitation to play with the New Orleans 
Pelicans summer team, which begins play on July 11 against the NBA D-League Select Team in Las Vegas.
The Pelicans, who finished 12th in the Western Conference 
with a 34-48 record in 2014, obtained just one player — Louis-ville guard Russ Smith — via trade during the draft.
Even with the opportunity to make the roster in New Or-
leans, it may be a long shot for Young to secure a spot. 
The Pelicans return Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson at 
power forward, Jason Smith and Alexis Ajinca at center, and they also traded for Houston Rockets big man Omer Asik on Thursday in exchange for a 2015 first round draft pick and $1.5 million.
Wilbekin will have stints with both the Memphis Grizzlies 
in the Orlando summer league and the Philadelphia 76ers in Las Vegas this summer, according to his agent Matt Ramker.

With the dissolution of the American 
Lacrosse Conference, Florida is moving 
to the Big East.
It was announced Thursday that 
Florida would be joining the Big East for 
the 2015 season after much debate about 
where the Gators would land at the end of the 2014 season.
The Gators spent five seasons in the 
ALC since the program started in 2010.
“We’re very excited for this next step 
for Florida lacrosse,” coach Amanda O’Leary said in a release. “We enjoyed the high level of competition in the ALC, 
and are looking forward to the new chal-
lenges the Big East will provide. 
“We’ve built a legacy of success dur-
ing our first five years and that’s some-thing we look to continue while compet-ing in the Big East.”
Florida and rival Vanderbilt will be 
moving to the conference together. The two teams join Cincinnati, Connecticut, Georgetown, Marquette, Temple and Villanova to round out the conference with eight teams.
With the move, Florida faces the chal-
lenge of playing stronger competitors.
The Gators finished 2014 with a 18-3 
record and completed the season as ALC regular season and tournament champions. In five seasons in the ALC, UF racked up four straight ALC regular-season titles, brought home two ALC tournament titles and made four straight NCAA Quarterfinals appearances.
“We’re excited to welcome Florida 
and Vanderbilt as affiliate members of the Big East Conference,” said Chris Schneider, Big East Associate Commis-sioner for Olympic Sports. “Both pro-grams have proven histories of success and will reinforce the strength and high level of play Big East women’s lacrosse is known for.”Women’s lacrosse moves

With a football program that grows further 
out of touch with its fanbase as the days go by, 
the University Athletic Association announced on April 14 that it was going to employ an in-novative way to respond to the qualms of sup-
porters.
Thus, the Fan Advisory Council was born. 
It features 13 people with current plans to meet 
quarterly, getting together for the first time in early-to-mid August.
The council is composed of one recent grad-
uate, four fans from the lowest donor levels in 
the UF booster club system, two from the high-
est donor level and four from the remaining five donor levels in between.
The final two spots are filled by current UF 
undergraduates, one of whom is senior Mitch-ell Barnes. The 21-year-old finance major from West Palm Beach didn’t grow up a Gators fan, in fact, his allegiances were placed further south with the University of Miami.
Sun Life Stadium may have only rarely 
been filled with fans when Barnes attended Hurricanes games in high school with his fam-ily’s season tickets, but something about Miami 
home games shapes the main idea he’ll bring 
to the table when the council meets for the first time.
“One thing that really sticks out in my mind 
when comparing Miami to Gainesville is that there’s just such an open tailgating environ-ment (in Miami),” Barnes said. “In Gainesville it’s interesting because there’s not so much of an open area for tailgating and even with that, 
a lot of campus is relatively closed off for tail-
gating.”
Barnes would like to see the school develop 
an area much like what Ole Miss has in “The Grove,” which is a consolidated spot on cam-pus where thousands join together pregame. He sees the scene on campus during fall Satur-days as too spread out.
Besides Miami and Florida, he’s seen games 
at Tennessee, Georgia, Vanderbilt, LSU, Florida State and Georgia Tech. That puts him in stark contrast with Alicia Zurita, the other student and one of four women on the committee.
Zurita is an 18-year-old advertising major 
from Deltona, Fla., who grew up watching Gator football games with her dad. She was un-Fan Advisory Council finalized

“I feel like no matter if you’re male 
or female or what color you are, 
people just come together no matter 
what for Gator football.”

“Just arrived at US Cellular Field to throw out the first pitch before 
tonight’s @whitesox game! Gonna bring the heat!” 
Jonathan Bostic, former UF linebackerThe Grizzlies appear set at 
the point guard position, with 
sixth-year veteran Mike Con-
ley averaging 33.5 minutes 
and 17.2 points per game in the 2014 regular season. But Wilbekin could be a valuable 
No. 2 option on a team that 
has yet to win a Conference Finals game.
If Wilbekin were to make it 
on the 76ers’ roster, he would 
be competing against Michael 
Carter Williams, the reign-ing NBA Rookie of the Year who averaged 16.7 points per 
game and a team-best 6.3 as-
sists per contest, for the top point guard spot. But after going 19-63 in 2014, spots on the Philadelphia roster are bound to be open.
Prather will also be head-
ing to Las Vegas as he will be working with the Atlanta Hawks summer league.
After having a career year 
in his final season at Florida — averaging 13.8 points on a .603 shooting clip — the Jack-son, Tenn., shooting guard is 
ready to prove that he wasn’t 
a one-year wonder.
The Hawks return two 
shooting guards who aver-aged more than 10 points per contest in 2014 — Kyle Korver (12.0) and Louis Wil liams (10.4) — and also have 
23-year-old John Jenkins and 
second-round selection La-mar Patterson in the mix.
Will Yeguete was the only 
senior to have not inked a deal with an NBA summer league team. The Bordeaux, France, native is expected to return to Europe to play pro-
fessionally.
Donovan coaches U18 
team to gold: Two days before 
the NBA Draft, UF coach Billy 
Donovan was at the helm of 
the USA U18 team.
After bringing home gold 
medals with the 2012 USA U18 team and the 2013 U19 
team, Donovan led the 2014 
USA U18 team to a 5-0 record in Colorado Springs, Colo., to bring his coaching record to 19-0.
“I think that as a coach in 
this kind of event, you’re only as good as your players,” Donovan said in a release. 
“I’ve been very fortunate that 
in the past three years, I’ve coached some great guys, great kids and have some great coaches working with 
me.”
In five games, the United 
States outscored its opponents 
by an average of 54.8 points 
per game, defeating each 
team by at least 34 points.USA U18 team 
breezed through the World Championships able to attend a UF game in person 
before coming to college because of the cost involved, but jumped on the opportunity to get affordable stu-dent season tickets and was able to 
bring her father to a game.
“I’ll never forget the first time I 
walked in and just sat in the student 
section,” Zurita said. “I was just like ‘Oh my gosh, this is awesome.’”
When she spoke with alligator-
Sports, she was “speechless” when told that she was the only female student named to the council, some-
thing she was previously unaware 
of. Zurita also adds variety to what is, racially, a homogeneous cross section of Gator fans. She is of Puer-to Rican descent and the only non-Caucasian member of the council.
“I feel like no matter if you’re 
male or female or what color you are, people just come together no matter what for Gator football,” Zurita said. “I guess it’s awesome 
that I could be a voice if any of the 
female students have something, now they have someone they can come and talk to.”
She wants more fan interaction 
and engagement during the in-game experience and an increased social media presence for fans during the actual game. Her idea was for a 
“tweet your seat” feature so images 
of fans could appear on the GatorVi-sion boards during games.The primary obstacle in the way 
of that for the UAA is the fact that the quality of cellphone service and in-stadium Wi-Fi is poor. Connec-tivity concerns are one of the most common complaints about the in-game experience in Ben Hill Grif-fin Stadium. The school is trying to 
combat the issue by upgrading the 
stadium’s antennae systems.
So UF is trying to reach you af-
ter all, John Q. Gator fan. The UAA hopes the council will help it directly get to know the organic needs of the fanbase. 
The FAC’s primary goal is to 
give the athletic department ideas to 
get fans to come early and stay late. 
Time will tell what impact it will have. 18, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 1, 2014

SALVADOR, Brazil — U.S. coach Jurgen 
Klinsmann is worried about the Algerian 
referee assigned to the Americans’ second-round World Cup match against Belgium on Tuesday.
FIFA announced Sunday that Djamel 
Haimoudi will work the game. Haimoudi is a veteran of the last two African Cups of Nations and worked a pair of group-stage matches at this year’s World Cup.
Klinsmann said Monday the French-
speaking referee will be able to communicate better with the Belgians, comes from a nation that was in the same first-round group with Belgium and is from a country eliminated by the U.S. at the 2010 tournament.
“Well, we hope it’s not a concern,” Klins-
mann said at a news conference. “Is it a good feeling? No.”
Belgian coach Marc Wilmots dismissed 
Klinsmann’s comments.
“If we start going into this, it is looking 
for excuses ahead of the match,” Wilmots said. “So to us, if it happens, too bad. We will shut up and return and try to get quali-fied again. This is football. “I rarely talk to referees. That is one thing. 
The three referees in the group stage, I never talked to them. And a referee is not there to 
talk, but to referee.”
Haimoudi, 43, worked at the Africa Cup 
of Nations in 2008 and 2012 and refereed 
Italy’s third-place win over Uruguay at last year’s Confederations Cup. At this World 
Cup, he officiated the Netherlands’ 3-2 win 
over Australia and Costa Rica’s 0-0 draw 
with England.
“We know that he did already two games 
so far, and he did them very well, so we wish 
that he continues his refereeing the perfect 
way he’s done so far,” Klinsmann said.
“I understand FIFA. It’s difficult always 
to choose the right referee for the right games, and it’s always being kind of tricky 
for FIFA, but it is what it is,” he added. “We 
give it absolutely the benefit of the doubt. 
We respect the decision, and we’re going to 
be spot on in the game and hope that every-
thing goes well.”
U.S. Soccer Federation President Sunil 
Gulati, a member of FIFA’s ruling executive 
committee, did not want to discuss Klins-
mann’s thoughts, saying merely: “I think 
he said everything that needs to be said on that.”
Two years ago, the Court of Arbitration 
for Sport said Haimoudi “claimed to have been assaulted” by Al-Hilal team president 
Mohammed Al-Birair during an African 
Champions League semifinal. The CAS up-held Al-Birair’s appeal and overturned a four-year suspension imposed by the Con-
federation of African Football in January 
2012, ruling “it is not convinced to the stan-
dard of `comfortable satisfaction’ that the appellant was the assailant responsible for the incident.”
The last time an African referee worked a 
U.S. match at the World Cup, the Americans 
complained when Koman Coulibaly of Mali 
disallowed an apparent go-ahead goal in the 85th minute of a 2-2 draw against Slovenia four years ago. Coulibaly never explained 
his decision.
 Jozy Altidore is available to play for the United States in Tuesday’s World Cup 
second-round game against Belgium, but it does not appear the forward is ready to re-
turn to the starting lineup.
Altidore strained his left hamstring in the 
Americans’ opener against Ghana on June 
16 and didn’t play in their next two games.
“We don’t know how much because we 
need to see how he’s going, but he’s avail-
able,” U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann said 
Monday. “How many minutes? We will see that during the game.”
Altidore had been working out on his 
own, jogging around the field at the Ameri-
cans’ training camp at Sao Paulo Futebol 
Clube. Klinsmann said he has to determine 
“how much work is in his legs.”
Aron Johannsson replaced Altidore at for-
ward for the remainder of the game against 
Ghana. But Klinsmann switched from a 4-4-
2 formation to a 4-5-1 against Portugal and 
Germany with a fifth midfielder instead of a 
second forward.
Altidore has 23 goals in 71 international 
appearances and is the top forward on the 
American roster.
“Just having him with us tomorrow is 
huge,” Klinsmann said.
“We respect the decision, and 
we’re going to be spot on in the 
game and hope that everything 
goes well.”

the ﬁ  ve most memorable UF games from the 2013-2014 season, and you responded by voting which of the 
ﬁ  ve was the best of the best (check 
results below).
Today we offer another install-
ment of the Alligator Awards: Best individual performance.
This time around, we narrowed 
the nominees down to four (two men and two women) and we’ll let you decide which one takes the 
crown. Be sure to vote online at al-
ligator.org/sports and check back next week for the ﬁ  nal results.
Bridgette Caquatto at the NCAA 
Championships (gymnastics):
As the ﬁ  nal competitor in the 
NCAA Championships, Bridgette Caquatto needed at least a 9.95 on her ﬂ  oor exercise to boost Florida 
into a tie for ﬁ  rst place alongside 
Oklahoma.
In the biggest stage of her young career, the sophomore out of Naper-ville, Ill., came through in the clutch for the Gators by earning exactly a 9.95, which tied a career best and sealed UF’s second straight national 
title.
“I had no idea what I needed go-
ing in, but the minute I came down 
(off the podium) and landed and they ﬂ  ashed the score, it was crazy,” Caquatto said.
Tyler Murphy against Arkansas 
(football):
Back in the day when Tyler 
Murphy was still enrolled at UF (he transferred to Boston College after the season), the redshirt junior quarterback lit up the Razorbacks by completing 16 of 22 passes for 240 yards and three touchdowns.
In his ﬁ  rst home start after tak-
ing over for the injured Jeff Driskel, Murphy guided the Gators to a 30-10 victory, which was the ﬁ  nal win for Florida on the season.
“I’m getting a lot more comfort-
able,” Murphy said. “It feels good.”
Scottie Wilbekin against Day-
ton (men’s basketball):
After suffering three straight Elite Eight losses, Florida needed a career performance by Scottie Wilbekin to break the streak and advance past Dayton into the Final Four.
In the Gators’ 62-52 victory, 
Wilbekin tied a career high with 23 points on 6-of-14 shooting, includ-ing 3 of 5 from three-point range. The senior point guard also added three assists and three steals without turning the ball over once.
“The struggles that we went 
through this year have just made it that much more fun and brought 
us that much closer together,” Wil-bekin said.
Delanie Gourley against Florida 
A&M (softball):
The Gators began their champi-
onship run with a bang after Dela-nie Gourley no-hit the Rattlers in the 
opening game of the NCAA Region-als.
In a shortened ﬁ  ve-inning contest 
(UF run ruled FAMU 8-0), Gourley struck out seven and only surren-dered one walk.
She recorded Florida’s 15th no-
hitter in program history and the 
ﬁ  rst ever during the postseason.

CornerReitz — The former center of student activity on campus, the 
J. Wayne Reitz Union, has been under construction since summer 
2013. The $75 million renovation is expected to be completed by Fall 2015. Free printing is still available in the ground floor com -
puter lab, as well as the free bike repair station, TRiP, Subway and the P.O.D. Market. The Career Resource Center is located upstairs, along with the bookstore and food court. 
Hub — Due to Reitz construction, the Hub has become a more 
popular place for students to meet, study and eat. You can find all the campus culinary favorites (Chick-fil-A, Einstein Bros Bagels and Starbucks) as well as a technology help desk and the UF Interna -
tional Center, which handles study abroad. There are also several group and individual study rooms available.
Krishna — You can find Krishna Lunch on the Plaza of the Ameri -
cas every weekday from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. when UF is in session. Served by local Hare Krishnas, a $5 donation gets you unlimited access to this “karma-free” vegetarian lunch (with full vegan sub -
stitutions).  
P.O.D.s  — Looking to grab a bite but can’t stand waiting in line? 
UF has multiple P.O.D. markets on campus that offer options rang-ing from candy bars to sushi. Some offer Starbucks and KFC. The Hub, Reitz and Rawlings each have a P.O.D., and Beaty Market and Little Hall express have similar options. 
▲Dining Halls  — For those with a meal plan, the on-campus 
options don’t stop at Gator Dining (Gator Corner) and Broward (the Fresh Food Company). Meal plans carry Flex Bucks that can be used at Pollo Tropical, Papa John’s, Croutons, the Camellia Court Cafe in the Harn Museum and Subway after 4 p.m. For those who avoid meat, UF was named the 2014 favorite Vegan-Friendly Large U.S. College by peta2.
Delivery — Lucky for UF students, many delivery companies will 
bring food right to your dorm room door (or even to certain buildings on campus). Midnight Cookies, Jimmy John’s, Gainesville2Go, $2 Delivery and 352Delivery are the usual suspects for getting your munchies fast-tracked to campus. Don’t forget to head downstairs to let them in.University Gallery  — Tucked away among the Fine 
Art buildings next to Southwest 13th Street, the Uni-
versity Gallery is a hidden gem that is one of UF’s best-kept secrets. UF professors and artists from around 
the world put their work on display here each semes -
ter. The opening receptions usually have free food and 
drinks, and if you walk in between classes, it’s one of the quietest spots on campus. 
Student Gardens/Ethnoecology Gardens  — 
Students with green thumbs and small dorm rooms can plant their roots at the student gardens. Plots are available to rent on a per semester basis. Located right behind the student gardens is the ethnoecology garden, which is an interactive experimental garden for students to explore the connection between plants and culture. It’s filled with exotic and unusual plants, making it a wonderful place to wander through.
Baughman Center  — On weekdays, this beautiful 
building is a quiet spot to relax or pray. On weekends, you’ll find weddings and special events. 
Lake Alice/Trails  — Lake Alice is the best spot 
on campus to spot a live gator. They’re usually 4-foot babies, but treat them with as much respect as their 10-foot parents. There are a few paths nearby that welcome runners, walkers and leashed pets. The Har -
monic Woods Conservation Path is a shortcut between Fraternity Row and Museum Road.
Wauburg  — When the Gainesville heat is beating 
down, a popular option for students is Lake Wauburg. Students can drive, bike or take  RTS route 128 bus (on Saturdays only) to the North Park of the lake. One Gator 1 Card per car is required to enter the park, where guests can swim, stand up paddleboard, kayak, canoe and sail. There are also picnic tables and grills available. The South Shore offers students free rock climbing and bouldering, a disc golf course, mountain-biking trails and team-building activities. The whole lake is closed on Mondays. 
Hang up a hammock  — Two of the best places 
to hang a hammock are the North Lawn between the Hub and Reitz Union and the Plaza of the Americas in front of Library West. Spots on the Plaza are coveted in Fall and Spring, but a Summer hang is cool and shady. The North Lawn serves as a quieter atmosphere with fewer trees for a more private hang. 
New Physics Building activities  — One of the 
best-kept secrets about UF is the lobby of the New Physics Building, which is chock-full of physics experi-ments. From the plasma ball to the anti-gravity mirror, the lobby serves as a mentally stimulating place to take your family or even your date. Tech discounts  - Check with the UF book -
store or Apple’s website for all kinds of stu -
dent and faculty discounts on Apple gear. For 
those looking for a monthly plan from AT&T, there’s a 17 percent discount for students at 
the Gainesville branch. 
A2 Fab Lab  — The architecture building 
has several hidden gems for students, such 
as the ability to try out laser cutters, 3-D print-
ers, a 3-D scanner and a 3-axis CNC router. 
It costs $20 per 3-D print for students and faculty and $15 for arts and architecture stu -
dents. The architecture printing lab is free for students too, and it has large plotters for larger print jobs. 
LYNDA  — Lynda.com offers 2,600 instruc -
tional courses on topics ranging from Web 
development and coding to business soft-
ware. Through a partnership with UF, all of 
these programs are free for students. Check 
the website for a list of all of the new skills you could learn. 
Microsoft products  — UF students can 
get Microsoft Office Suite for free from the 
UFIT website, including Microsoft Word, Pow -
erPoint and Excel. They can be installed on 
up to five devices, including mobile and tab -
let devices.  
UFApps  — For students who want to use 
pricey software on a budget, UFApps is the solution. It can access programs like Matlab, Solidworks or Serif from any device. For a full list of programs and information on how to 
connect, check out the UFApps website. 
Reitz printing  — Currently enrolled stu -
dents who are in need of a printer can stop 
by the Reitz Union Printing Lab located on the ground floor, which is provided by Student Government. With 45 computers and five 
printers, students can print up to 250 pages 
for free each semester.
RTS —  Due to the size of campus and lack 
of parking, many students ride Gainesville’s Regional Transit System buses to get around 
campus and town. If your evening plans in-
volve hitting up Midtown or downtown, forget driving and ride the Later Gator, the late-night bus service provided by RTS, for a safe ride home. Any student with a Gator 1 Card can ride for free.
The Alligator  — That’s us! Your favorite 
independent student newspaper. We’re the largest student-run newspaper in the nation, and we’re dedicated to bringing you the un -
biased, informative news you rely on. In the Summer, we publish Tuesdays and Thursdays, but look for us every weekday in the Fall and Spring. Keep an eye out for the orange boxes, the orange “A” in the black racks on campus or check us out online at Alligator.org. 
UF Cultural Plaza  — The cultural plaza 
contains UF’s Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art, the Florida Museum of Natural History and 
the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. 
The museums are free for current students, including the “Wolf to Woof” exhibit and the butterfly garden at the Florida Museum. Stu -
dent government-funded performances are often hosted at the Phillips Center, making them free for students.
TRiP  — UF’s Travel and Recreation Pro-
gram, TRiP, is located in the Outfitter on the ground floor of the Reitz Union. TRiP hosts 20-
30 adventures each Fall, Spring and Summer 
semester. Prices range from less than $100 to $900 (for international trips) and groups are usually made up of 10 to 20 students. Popular trips include backpacking, skiing, ca-noeing and hiking.
SNAP  — Also known as the Student Night-
time Auxiliary Patrol, SNAP is a free, nightly way to travel across campus safely. The 2014 
summer service runs from 8:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
every night. All SNAP employees are UF stu -
