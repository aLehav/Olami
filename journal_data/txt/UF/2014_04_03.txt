Geoffrey Lioon nearly  
scored $100,000 from Warren 
Buffett. 
The 24-year-old UF 
student was ranked No. 4 in the highly publicized Quicken Loans Billion Dollar 
Bracket Challenge until 
Saturday. 
When Arizona lost, Lioon 
fell to number 4,792 out of the possible 15 million entrants.
“I didn’t get anything 
done because I had to watch every game,” Lioon said. “No studying was done because I 
was so stressed out.”
Lioon, an information 
systems and operations 
master’s student, said losing the $100,000, granted to each 
of the top 20 winners, won’t 
be as rough if the Gators — his No. 1 pick — end up winning the championship.
“The fact that I was even 
able to come so close to make 
it to the top 20 going into last Saturday night,” Lioon said, “was pretty remarkable.”
Lioon said using statistics 
but factoring in upsets are 
his top pieces of advice.
“At the end of the day, it’s 
a crap shoot almost,” Lioon said. “I’ve seen girls win it that haven’t watched one game all year.”
Jonathan Arnholz, a 
20-year-old UF public relations sophomore and vice president of the Men’s Basketball Rowdies, said his 
ﬁ  fth bracket, which he spent 
the least time on, was doing the best.
“It’s certainly an 
accomplishment,” Arnholz said in response to Lioon’s bracket, “but a lot of luck also goes into it.”
Lioon said the challenge 
got harder toward the end of the tournament because the points for each game increased.
“When it rains, it pours,” 
Lioon said. “Everyone reaches a point where their bracket busts, and I hit that 
wall.”
Lioon said he posted 
pictures of proof on his 
Facebook page and received 
a lot of enthusiasm and hope Gator almost 
wins $100K from Warren Buffett

Veg-heads are celebrating UF’s 
latest vegan victory.
UF was voted the Favorite Vegan-
Friendly college in the large school 
category in a contest by peta2, the 
youth outreach division of the ani-
mal rights group PETA.
The results of the competition, 
which featured 16 large schools and 16 small schools, were released this week.
Winners were determined by votes cast on peta2’s website. UF re-ceived 2,795 votes. It won by fewer than 50 votes against Kent State Uni-versity in the ﬁ  nal round.
Peta2 has had vegan-friendly 
competitions in the past, but this was the ﬁ  rst year it was entirely vot-
ing based, said Kenneth Montville, 
PETA’s college campus coordina-tor. 
The vegan report card was a new 
feature this year. Schools were asked to ﬁ  ll out surveys about their vegan options. The results from the sur-veys were translated into a grade on the vegan report card.
UF received an A on the report 
card, as did the University of South Florida and Rollins College.
“These contests are meant to cel-
ebrate the schools that are doing a fantastic job providing vegan food to their students,” Montville said.
Christina Bicknell, a 19-year-old 
UF public relations sophomore and a peta2 representative for UF, said this victory will help implement changes on campus.
“I feel after winning this 
competition, Gator Dining will want to expand the options available for students on campus in order to UF voted favorite vegan-friendly college

Jake Rush said he did not write violent, 
sexual comments as Chazz Darling.
The U.S. Congressional candidate whose 
involvement in live-action role-playing and 
online fantasy gaming was recently called 
into question released another statement 
Wednesday attributing the controversial comments to someone else.
In the statement from Rush’s campaign, 
a man identiﬁ  ed as fellow gamer Lee Snyder said he wrote the online comments that in-sinuated sexual assault under the username 
Chazz Darling. He said he made the com-
ments in character through “a shared ac-count, which had several users.”
Snyder apologized in the statement for 
any confusion and embarrassment that the comments caused. 
Rush, a local attorney 
and former Alachua Coun-ty Sheriff’s deputy, began drawing criticism after 
SaintPetersblog published 
a post calling him out for 
taking part in supernatu-ral role-playing games. The story was picked up by publications including Vanity Fair and Gawker.
SaintPetersblog reported that the com-
ments referenced forced oral sex and cocaine use.
Rush is running against incumbent 
Gainesville Tea Party Congressman Ted Yoho. They will face off in the Aug. 26 Re-publican primary. The general election for the District 3 congressional seat will be Nov. 4. Rush’s campaign attributes comments to another gamerSEE BRACKET, PAGE 4

Tyler Ritz, a 19-year-old UF aerospace engineering sophomore, watches the History Channel’s “Ameri-
can Pickers” in his ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor Simpson Hall room Wednesday afternoon. A recent study by consulting ﬁ  rm Deloitte found that millennials watch less TV than older people do.
� THEY PREFER OPTIONS.
SILVIA RUEDA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Wendy Trantham doesn’t con-
sider herself a TV person, but when 
the 19-year-old wants to catch up on 
a show, she does it the old-fashioned 
way: in front of her television set.
A new study by consulting ﬁ  rm 
Deloitte shows that Trantham, a UF 
exploratory freshman, is in the mi-
nority for her generation.
Millennials, the generation repre-
sented by ages 14 to 24, spend only 44 percent of their time watching 
movies and shows using a TV.
The rest of the time is spent 
watching media on a computer, 
smartphone, tablet or gaming de-
vice. Computers lead as device of 
choice at 32 percent.The study also shows that the 
older a generation is, the more time it spends watching TV.
People part of the generation 
labeled as “matures,” ages 67 and older, watch TV 92 percent of the time they want to watch a show or movie.
Dennis Frohlich, a third-year UF 
health communications doctoral student and instructor for The Cul-tural Impact of Video Games, said 
the results are not surprising.
When it comes to where view-
ers consume media, there’s a gen-
erational gap because older people are more likely to stick to what they 
know, and young people want op-
tions, he said.    
Millennials may also be more in-
clined to watch movies and shows 
online because of cost beneﬁ  ts.
“A cable bill on top of a cellphone 
bill and other utilities can add up to be a lot for a college student,” 
Frohlich said.
In the coming years, online 
streaming providers will try differ-ent things, such as recently releas-ing series entirely on the web, he said. With an increased interest in alternative ways to consume media, 
there will continue to be plenty of 
room for experimentation.
Reed Jostes, a Santa Fe College 
family, youth and community fresh-
man, said he doesn’t make it a prior-
ity to watch a show when it ﬁ  rst airs on TV.
“I’ll make sure to get my school 
work done ﬁ  rst,” Jostes, 19, said.
Matthew Paymer, a 22-year-old 
UF environmental engineering se-nior, said he hardly watches televi-sion.
“When I absolutely have to watch 
something, I normally go online to do it,” he said.Study: Millennials watching less TV

Every two minutes, some-
one is sexually assaulted.
The statistic from several 
reports may appear grim, 
but UF and other agencies in 
Gainesville have a message to 
spread:  Sexual violence will not be tolerated.
This message will be heard 
loud and clear tonight at 5:30 when UF students meet on the Plaza of the Americas to march against sexual violence.
The event, called Take Back 
the Night, is sponsored by the Alachua County Victim Servic-es and Rape Crisis Center and various UF organizations to kick off Sexual Assault Aware-ness Month.
Jessie Lazarchik, an Ala-
chua County victim advocate, said this “empowering” event 
is a chance to give UF a voice 
against sexual assault.
“This event allows everyone 
to come together and create a positive atmosphere to speak out against sexual violence,” Lazarchik said.
Rita Lawrence, a GatorWell Health Promotion Services in-terpersonal violence prevention coordinator, said sexual assault 
is a “silent epidemic.” Only 
two out of 10 victims of sexual assault report it, and half of women who were victims don’t even consider what happened to them assault, she said.
Jennifer Heard, an Ala-
chua County victim advocate therapist, said effects of sexual 
assault vary from person to 
person. The most common con-sequences include ﬂ  ashbacks, nightmares, loss of sense of safety and a distrust with self and others.
Heard said educating the 
public about “bystander inter-vention” is key to preventing 
sexual assault.
“If you see something, say 
something,” she said.
Heard said she encourages 
victims to report sexual assault 
incidents in whatever ways they feel comfortable.
“We are not going to turn 
our back on you,” Heard said. 
“The healing process is uncom-
fortable and hard, but help is available when you are ready to get through it.”Gainesville to take

People even jokingly asked for money, but 
he mentally prepared for the worst.
“My own roommate was like, ‘I need new 
braces, man.’” Lioon said. “I told him, ‘I’m 
not buying you braces even if I win.’”
Lioon said he was hoping to be in Dallas 
this weekend with a winning bracket and a winning team.
But he said that having the best of both 
worlds seemed too good to be true.
“My roommates asked me, ‘If you had to 
choose between the $100,000 and the Gators winning, what would you choose?’ That’s such a difficult question,” Lioon said. “I maybe would pick the $100,000, just because 
I have a lot of student debt to pay off.”continue being a vegan-friendly campus,” Bicknell 
said.
Vegetarian Allie Jones, a 19-year-old UF busi-
ness administration freshman, said she was orig-inally worried that a meal plan would leave her stuck with salads. However, she now considers UF vegan-friendly because she never had a problem finding something she could eat.
“Gator Dining always had a least two com-
pletely vegetarian options every day, plus sand-wiches, pastas and salads you could make vegetar-ian also,” Jones said.
Caroline Stocks, a 19-year-old UF recreation 
and event management sophomore, said some of her friends had to stop being vegetarians when they went to other colleges because of limited op-tions.
“I’ve been a vegetarian since I was 6 years old, 
so I don’t know what I would do if I had to go back to eating meat like my friends at different schools,” Stocks said.
UF’s vegetarian-friendly reputation was some-
thing that drew Emily Born, a 20-year-old UF Eng-lish and political science junior, to the school in the first place.
“Going to a school that sells vegan items all over 
campus makes my life easier, but it also shows that UF cares about its student’s needs and, to some ex-tent, a cause that matters a lot to me,” Born said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 2014

You can check if the Instagram 
you just posted has any likes, or 
you can enjoy a cold pint of Blue Moon. But you can’t do both.
Such is the ultimatum posed 
by The Offline Glass, a beer glass with an iPhone-sized notch cut out of the bottom. If your iPhone is not wedged into the gap in the glass, the beer will spill. The product, created by Brazilian artist Mauri-cio Perussi, serves to discourage the use of smartphones in bars and restaurants.
Stephanie Comstock, general 
manager at The Swamp Restau-rant, said she’s seen a dramatic in-crease in the use of smartphones in the 12 years she’s been working on  and off at the restaurant. She said the escalation of smartphone use is a result of the growing desire to re-main plugged in.Comstock said if the product 
was manufactured in America, she would consider stocking The Offline Glass, primarily for use at dinnertime. She said that although the use of smartphones during late-night socializing at bars is forgiv-able, the growth of smartphone use during mealtimes is unacceptable.
“Food should be enjoyed and 
eaten — not hurried down or com-pletely ignored,” Comstock said.
Heidi Steinour, a UF sociology 
instructor, said the limitless access to information made available by smartphones has become irresist-ible, especially among the younger population.
“I definitely think that it could 
have potential to at least bring con-scious awareness to how often you go to your phone if you are not able to access it at all times,” Steinour, 27, said.
Mark Peicher, a 19-year-old UF 
biology freshman, said he would applaud bars and restaurants that stocked their shelves with The Of-
fline Glass. He said he makes an ef-
fort to turn his iPhone on airplane mode when he is socializing in bars at night.
“The world has become so fas-
cinated with what everyone is do-ing and getting constant updates,” Peicher said. “Honestly, it’s not worth it.”

In another case of hiding drugs in interesting orifices, 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies arrested a local 
man Monday night after a traffic stop search revealed he was hiding about 11 grams of marijuana in his butt.
Deputies arrested 23-year-old Joshua Paul Manley on 
charges of marijuana possession, according to an arrest report. 
At about 9:50 p.m., police responded to a report of a suspicious car in the 7700 block of North-west 41st Avenue. 
At the scene, a deputy stopped the car 
for a broken headlight, according to the report. 
Manley was the passenger in the car, 
and the deputy noticed him making quick movements.
The deputy searched the car and 
found marijuana on the passenger floor-board, according to the report.
When deputies searched Manley, they found a pre-
scription bottle with about 11.4 grams of marijuana hid-den between his butt cheeks, according to the report. 
Deputies also found a blunt in the car that tested posi-
tive for marijuana. 
Deputies booked Manley into the Alachua County Jail 
at about 11:20 p.m. 
He was released on his own recognizance at 12:16 p.m.

UF’s collegiate boxing team 
will step into the ring for its first 
intercollegiate national competi-tion since becoming a sports club in 2012.
Students from 22 universities 
from around the country will fight for a belt at the National Champi-onships of Men’s and Women’s College Boxing through Saturday in Miami.
J.C. Papaleo, the team’s coach 
and a former boxer, said the team has three men and one woman, and they will all be competing in the tournament.
Papaleo said his athletes don’t 
know what to expect, but they are determined and committed.
“It might sound a little bit too 
greedy, but I want all my guys to win,” he said. “I don’t want to just put up a good fight and compete. I want my guys to come back with the belt.”
Vance Vielot, a 23-year-old UF 
political science sophomore and member of the team, said he has been boxing for two to three years on and off. He said the team has been training for this competition for about three to four months, and it has been tough. “You just have to be really 
disciplined in this sport,” he said. “That’s the only way to balance it out.”
This tournament will be the 
first for Justin Sage, a 19-year-old UF linguistics sophomore and member of the team, who has been boxing for about four months. 
The team practiced two hours 
daily to prepare. 
He said he hopes all the hard 
work will pay off by winning the tournament.
“It would mean everything 
to me. It’s one of the greatest ac-complishments you can have, you know, just knowing that you trained every day super hard,” Sage said. “Stepping in a ring, knowing you can get hurt and coming out on top. It’s the great-est feeling you can have.”

UF’s wakeboarding club is hosting Wakefest 2014 at Lake Wauburg on Saturday. The 
club is dealing with budget cuts and using a raffle to help balance the finances.

Wakefest is more important this year than 
ever before.
Wakefest 2014, hosted by the Gator Wake-
board Club, is the biggest annual fundraiser 
for the club. On Saturday at the Lake Wauburg 
South Shore, the team will gather students and 
alumni for a wakeboarding competition, raffle and live music.
Traditionally, the team operates within a 
$20,000 budget, said club president Jon Kiste-maker, a 21-year-old UF biology student. But at the end of this fiscal year, the club will be left to raise the money needed to practice and travel to competitions on its own.
Due to budget cuts, RecSports told the team 
that in order to continue practicing at Lake Wauburg next semester, it must raise $3,200.
The team is sending letters to alumni and 
parents requesting donations. It’s planning car washes and social events and selling T-shirts.
The club will charge $25 to register in one 
of the competition’s five divisions and an ad-ditional $15 to compete in an extra division. 
Kistemaker said he hopes about 30 competitors 
will register.
Katherine Anderson, a 20-year-old UF 
health education and behavior sophomore, has been competing for the Gator Wakeboard Club since Wakefest 2013.
Although she enjoyed wakeboarding recre-
ationally during high school, Anderson said she never competed until she joined the UF team. 
Last year, she went to the event to connect 
with fellow student wakeboarders, with no in-tention to compete.
However, about 20 minutes before the wom-
en’s division began, a member of the team con-vinced her to register and get out on the water.
“Pretty much since then, I have been ob-
sessed with the club and everyone in it and ev-
erything we do,” Anderson said.
As one of the first members of the team to 
hear about the budget cuts, she said she was 
both surprised and appalled.
“I was astonished because we have so much 
involvement and we are so successful in our competitions,” Anderson said. “We are second ranked  in the nation, and our club isn’t short on participation.”Club to host Wakefest, combat decreased RecSports funding

FORT HOOD, Texas — A gunman 
opened fire Wednesday at Fort Hood in 
an attack that left four dead, including the shooter, law enforcement officials said.
One of the officials, citing official inter-
nal U.S. Justice Department updates, said 14 others were hurt. A U.S. law enforcement of-ficial said reports circulating within the Jus-tice Department indicate the shooter died of what appears to be a self-inflicted wound.
The Texas Army base was the scene of a 
mass shooting in 2009. Thirteen people were killed and more than 30 wounded in what was the deadliest attack on a domestic mili-
tary installation in history.
The Army said on its official Twitter feed that the post was still on lockdown. Injured 
people were being treated at the post’s Carl R. Darnall Medical Center and other local 
hospitals.
Outside the base, some relatives of sol-
diers waited for news about their loved 
ones.
Tayra DeHart, 33, said she had last heard 
from her husband, a soldier at the post, that he was safe, but that was hours earlier.
“The last two hours have been the most 
nerve-wracking I’ve ever felt. I know God is 
here protecting me and all the soldiers, but 
I have my phone in my hand just hoping it will ring, and it will be my husband,” De-Hart said.
Brooke Conover, whose husband was 
on base at the time of the shooting, said she found out about it while checking Facebook. She said she called her husband, Staff Sgt. Sean Conover, immediately to make sure he 
was OK, but he couldn’t even tell her exactly 
what was going on, only that the base was locked down.
“I’m still hearing conflicting stories about 
what happened and where the shooting was exactly,” Conover said, explaining that she still doesn’t know how close the incident was to her husband.
“I just want him to come home,” said 
Conover, who moved to Fort Hood with her husband and three daughters two years ago.
In Chicago, President Barack Obama 
vowed that investigators will get to the bot-tom of the shooting, seeking to reassure the nation whose sense of security once again has been shaken by mass violence.
In a hastily arranged statement, Obama 
said he and his team were following the situation closely but that details about what happened at the sprawling Army post were still fluid. He said the shooting brought back painful memories of the 2009 attack.
Obama reflected on the sacrifices troops 
stationed at Fort Hood have made — in-cluding during multiple tours to Iraq and Afghanistan.
“They serve with valor, they serve with 
distinction and when they’re at their home base, they need to feel safe,” Obama said. “We don’t yet know what happened to-night, but obviously that sense of safety has been broken once again.”

A UF College of Education center 
will receive $5 million annually for 
the next three years from the U.S. De-partment of Education. The grant is to improve the preparation of special 
education teachers, general education 
teachers and school principals.
The UF Collaboration for Effective 
Educator Development, Account-ability and Reform Center is working alongside special education groups and school districts in Florida, Cali-fornia, Connecticut, Illinois and South Dakota.
Mary Brownell, UF’s CEEDAR 
center director and a professor of special education, said the goal of the project is to ensure students with dis-abilities get a high-quality education. 
“We work intensively with five 
states every year, up to 20 states, to improve their policies around prepa-
ration,” she said. 
Brownell said this project will give 
UF a “tremendous amount of visibil-
ity” in the education community.
“It is a very high-profile center,” 
she said. “It is the largest project that has ever been awarded by the Office of Special Education Programs.”
Lindsay Brock, an 18-year-old UF 
public relations freshman, said she has a special appreciation for the goals and achievements of this program be-cause her sister has autism.
“One day, I hope people with dis-
abilities have a great education pro-gram that prepares them for a place like UF,” she said.Education center to receive

A recent UF study found 
that Floridians’ confidence 
in the economy returned to a pre-recession high this month.  
And after years of local 
businesses closing, Gainesville store owners are breathing easier.
“We lost money for a 
while,” said Matthew Turner, owner of Wolfgang boutique at 1127 W. University Ave. “We had to really scrape and pay attention to how much we were spending each month.”
Turner credits the store’s 
survival to his emphasis on customer service. 
Wolfgang regularly hosts 
events like cocktail parties, 
which include complimenta-
ry drinks and raffle prizes, to 
show customer appreciation.Steven Kirn, executive di-
rector of UF’s David F. Miller 
Center for Retailing Educa-
tion and Research, said in-dependent stores thrive by building strong relationships with customers and adapting to their needs.
 “The same things that help 
stores survive during hard times help them thrive during good times,” Kirn said.
Persona Vintage Clothing 
& Costumes, which opened in 1980 and is located at 201 SE Second Place, survived the recent recession by sticking to the eclectic image of the store, said owner Nava Ottenberg.    
Not all stores suffer during 
hard economic times, Kirn said, as customers can choose less expensive options.
Urban Thread, which has 
two Gainesville locations, is known for offering popular brands at affordable prices, said owner Lilly Kline.
Kirn said the real challenge 
of opening a store in a college town is building a loyal cus-tomer base because student turnover is so high.
Although Urban Thread at-
tracts many college students, Kline said customers return after they graduate.
“We do not just cater to 
one group,” she said.
Michelle Lyman, a 22-year-
old UF neuroscience senior, said she goes to smaller stores 
for unique pieces.
“They tend to have clothes 
that are more stylish, and not 
something you would see in a catalog,” Lyman said.Local businesses bounce back
“We lost money for a 
while.”

FERPA needs revamp
As we reported Wednesday, students have noticed a sud-
den inﬂ  ux of emails from a website called ClusterFlunk advertising networking services. Although junk email 
plagues everyone, Webmail’s spam ﬁ  lter usually catches them. However, as in this case, messages occasionally trickle through, 
reminding us that personal data — such as students’ university 
email addresses — are public knowledge.
The federal law protecting students’ information, the Family 
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, allows schools to give out-side parties access to student information as long as it falls under the category of “directory information.” At UF, $100 gets you students’ name, email address, phone number, major, class and college, enrollment status and other nuggets of info concerning student life. 
UF isn’t doing anything wrong when it provides advertisers 
with student information. FERPA stipulates that directory infor-mation may be granted to those who request it from a university without the student’s permission. 
But according to Educause, in recent years, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education has amended FERPA’s regulations and al-lowed for an increase of private companies’ and third parties’ access to student data. 
“The 2008 changes expanded the deﬁ  nition of ‘school ofﬁ  -
cials’ to include ‘contractors, consultants, volunteers, and other parties to whom an educational agency or institution has out-sourced institutional services or functions it would otherwise use employees to perform,’” Marc Rotenberg, the executive di-rector of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, wrote. “This amendment gives companies like Google and Parchment access to education records and other private student information.”
Google’s increased access to student data has landed the 
company in some trouble: The Internet conglomerate is cur-
rently facing a lawsuit concerning its mass scanning of student 
emails to deliver ads, according to the Guardian. 
This is hardly what lawmakers envisioned when they de-
signed FERPA. Rotenberg wrote, “When FERPA was enacted almost forty years ago, Congress made it clear that students’ personal information should not be made widely available. Con-gress was particularly concerned that if student records fell into the hands of private parties, these records could hurt students later in life when, for example, students were seeking jobs.”
Clearly, FERPA needs to be tightened up.First of all, students at public universities should be notiﬁ  ed 
when someone —  whether it be a parent, potential employer or ClusterFlunk marketer — requests his or her directory informa-tion. This is as much a safety issue as it is a privacy issue because your local and permanent addresses fall under the directory umbrella. If someone you don’t know can access your home ad-dress, wouldn’t you want to know?
Students should have the option to opt in rather than manu-
ally unsubscribing from ads whose creators obtained data with-out their knowledge. In addition, advertisers should have a monthly cap on how many emails they may send. We think it’s high time for better regulations to be enacted.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Do you have any 
embarrassing hobbies?Today’s question: Do you have cable?Unpaid internships create cycle of privilege
When I was an underclassman, I asked every 
graduating senior the same question: What does it feel like to be moving on to real life? I 
rarely got the same answer. 
Now that I’m graduating in a month, here is the de-
ﬁ  nitive answer on how it feels to graduate (at least with a journalism degree): terrifying. 
My problem, shared by many other near-graduates, 
I’m sure, is a lack of prospects. In my case, that lack of prospects comes from a lack of experience. 
I blamed myself for a while for my lackluster resume. 
But then I realized it wasn’t all that lackluster — I have experience with known publications. I’ve had a column appearing here every Thursday this entire academic year, and I’m getting a journalism degree.
I have clips, contacts and conviction — but no intern-
ships.
It seems like a problem with an easy solution. For other 
majors, maybe it is: The internships actually pay. It took all my self-control not to throw myself out of the near-est window when my engineering friend talked about his internship with Lockheed Martin, complete with a fur-nished luxury apartment and salary. It must be nice. 
Most journalism internships don’t pay. Naturally, the 
ones that do are far more competitive and typically re-quire — you guessed it — a previous internship. 
Unfortunately, many college students are unable to 
work a full-time job for free and still pay for food and a place to stay in an unfamiliar city. It doesn’t help when the internship is in a place like New York City, where the cost of living is astronomical. 
My family lived paycheck to paycheck growing up. 
Since I’ve been at school, their ﬁ  nancial outlook hasn’t changed. They can’t afford to give me much, let alone foot the bill for my semester in NYC. That means I can either ﬁ  nd a part-time job that somehow covers all my expenses while still working full time for free, or I just can’t go. A loan may be an option, but con-sidering I’m already graduating $15,000 in debt despite having Florida Prepaid, Bright Futures, Pell Grants and a job, I’m not too keen on that plan. 
And my story is only one 
among multitudes. I’m lucky as far as debt goes: The average 
graduate has $29,400 of loans. Without necessary experi-ence to get a job, paying it back won’t be easy. 
People in this situation get left behind despite their 
best efforts. More privileged members of society don’t have to worry about this problem. 
They can afford to work for free while someone else 
foots the bill. This ensures that the cycle of privilege con-tinues: Coming from privilege, you have the contacts to get you in the door and the money to keep yourself there.  
An internship shouldn’t be something you have to 
buy. By paying interns, organizations would be making an investment in the future and giving less-privileged students the same shot at getting experience as they give to those who are better off. 
Until then, students unable to afford an internship 
will continue to be left behind without the experience necessary to get a job. Student debt will continue to grow. Graduates will continue to be forced into underpaying jobs they don’t want, and those who had privilege in the ﬁ  rst place will keep getting further ahead. 
It’s too late for me, though. I’ll make good use of my 
journalism degree by doing the same job I’ve been doing for two years to sustain myself — transcribing dictations from ﬁ  nancial advisers.

MTV’s “Are You The One?” 
came to a close last week after a 
season full of relationship drama. 
Now the creators behind the hit 
show are looking for next sea-son’s cast. 
The social dating experiment 
came to a head in its finale where the cast found each of their per-fect matches. 
The show was not only an 
MTV first but also a pioneer in 
televised matchmaking.  If you didn’t get a chance to catch this 
season, “Are You the One?” cen-ters around 10 single women and 
10 single men living in Hawaii 
with one objective: finding their perfect match.
Each week, the cast locks in 
their choice of who they think is perfect for them. Here’s the catch: If all 20 people find their other halves within 10 tries, they split $1 million. 
Damon Furberg, supervising 
casting director, said the show came about because of “the way people are dating now and how kind of messed up it is.”
Where people once met a 
partner through 
friends, in col-
lege, or even at a bar, they are now meeting 
through Tinder, 
Facebook, Twit-ter and other on-
line dating websites, he said. 
Despite all these outlets “con-
necting us,” there is still a chal-lenge to make a genuine connec-tion. 
That’s where the show comes in, Furberg said.
With the success of season one 
and its closing last week, casting 
for season two is in full swing. 
And if you’re interested in 
finding your perfect match on 
“Are You the One?,” Furberg said 
he is looking for people ready for 
a relationship.
“The main thing is just be open 
minded and be open to the possi-bility to finding your match,” he 
said.
Additionally, your previous 
relationships are a huge part 
of the formula to how the show finds its perfect matches. 
Furberg said psychological 
tests and professional matchmak-
ers are involved,  and the show 
looks for people who have pat-terns in their dating lives. 
The show tries to help singles 
break away from that negative pattern and instead find a per-son “who isn’t necessarily what they always go for but what they need,” Furberg said.
If you’re interested in find-
ing your perfect match, you can apply for “Are You the One?” at lighthearted.com/ayto-casting.

When I put Santa Paws on Tinder, I expected 
the occasional cat lover to swipe right. What I got 
was an overwhelming response from shirtless 
bros, UF athletes and older men spitting game at a kitten.
They all wanted to get their paws on him. 
And, 222 matches and some introspection lat-
er, I’ve come to terms that my cat is just cuter 
than I am. Here are some of my (unconfirmed) thoughts on why:
1. The intimidation factor:It’s easier to talk to a cat than a human, espe-
cially when the cat is as cute as mine. Putting a face with a name can be nerve wracking. There are so many doubts that come with swiping: That girl is so hot; she’s way out my league. Cats are in everybody’s league. 
Who says no to a cat? No one.
2. My cat is just gorgeous:
Probably the most likely theory. Irresistible 
purr. Silky fur. Pink little button nose. He’s basi-cally a model. He doesn’t rack up the Instagram likes for no reason.
“What’s up you can lick me any day ;)”
3. The mystery of not knowing is desirable:
Deep down, there’s a human being behind 
the feline facade. I was genuinely surprised by just how many of the guys wanted to know what I looked like, prodding for Snapchats or my In-stagram name. When you don’t know what the other person looks like, you can imagine them to be as hot as you want.
“It’s a damn shame there isn’t a face behind 
that wit.”
“Are you as cute as your cat?”4. It’s a noncommittal swipe:
Swiping yes to a cat, there is absolutely no 
chance of seeing them on campus. No regrettable 
encounters at a bar or having to avoid making 
eye contact in line at Einstein’s. Zero awkward.
“Lets meet in the alley for a White Russian 
sometime.”
5. Cat jokes are easier to make than having 
an actual conversation:
There is so much material to use when talking 
to a cat, really. It’s way easier to have a funny, pun-filled conversation than trying to actually get to know someone. 
“What say you, me, and a laser pointer get to-
gether and see what happens?”
“I just scored an eighth of some dank cat-
nip.”Five theories on why my cat is 
more popular on Tinder than I am

Four Lokos, the infamous drink 
responsible for many memorable  
yet hard-to-remember nights for partiers, could be taken off shelves.
According to Food Safety News’ 
website, Four Loko’s parent com-pany, Phusion Projects LLC, has halted the production of caffeinated alcoholic drinks and agreed to make changes to its marketing plan.
Phusion has been accused of tar-
geting underage drinkers and pro-moting excessive drinking.
With its cheap price, carbonation 
and 12-percent alcohol content, it is easy to see why a Four Loko is ap-pealing to a younger demographic.
Sophia Napoles, a 22-year-old 
UF advertising senior, said the ﬁ  rst 
time she had a Four Loko, she only 
took one sip.
Napoles said she is not a fan of 
the brand and associates it with people seeking to get obnoxiously drunk.
“The majority of people I know 
who have drank it have either blacked out, gotten alcohol poison-ing, been injured or have been that sloppy kid at the party,” she said.
Napoles said she thinks it won’t 
take long for another Four Loko con-coction to hit the market.
But Andrew Moschiano, a 
25-year-old UF anthropology se-nior, said he has already seen similar products.
“I think Snoop Dogg marketed 
one called Joose,” Moschiano said. “I’d imagine a gimmicky, similar beverage will be out soon.”
Four Lokos were something Mo-schiano said he enjoyed when he was younger, but now he realizes how harmful they are.
“The ﬁ  rst time I had a Four Loko 
can be summed up as a ‘blackout in a can,’” he said.
Julia Rae Varnes, a GatorWell 
health promotions specialist, said there are multiple factors that con-tribute to the dangers of drinking Four Lokos.
Due to the large size and 12-per-
cent alcohol volume, one Four Loko is equivalent to four to six beers. The carbonation also intensiﬁ  es the drink, Varnes said. 
Varnes said she believes Phusion 
markets this product so heavily to college students due to the misguid-ed concept that drinking in college is normative or expected.
The can’s ﬂ  ashy colors and the 
drink’s masked taste also make it appealing to more inexperienced drinkers, she said.
“It’s marketed as a single drink, 
but it’s actually multiple,” Varnes said. “Carbonation increases alcohol consumption so you’ll feel intoxi-cated more quickly.”

“Noah” is an insane movie expe-
rience.  
The two-hour-plus nightmare 
drama, starring Russell Crowe 
(“Gladiator,” “Les Miserables”) as 
the titular character and directed by 
Darren Aronofsky (“Black Swan”), is an artful, exhilarating, surreal work that sometimes gets frustrat-ingly bogged down in blockbuster cliches. 
It changes one of the most iconic 
stories in the best-selling book of all time, the Bible, into a fever-vision 
parable for modern human greed 
and corruption of the Earth. The movie delivers a warning that unless we change our polluting ways, there will be disastrous consequences.
In this sense, the movie succeeds. 
Some of the most moving parts of “Noah” are the scenes in which na-ture is shown in all its beauty.
A couple of visually stunning se-
quences — one showing all different species of animals streaming onto the ark en masse and another an animated retelling of the beginning of the universe — not only entertain but showcase a rare artistic vision. The ending of the movie makes sure we know where Aronofsky, inter-estingly a self-proclaimed atheist, stands on the conservation of Earth and all its species.
However, because this is a mod-
ern-day blockbuster, “Noah” also tries to be a fantasy epic — Bible gone Tolkien — complete with 
hand-to-hand combat, magical wise 
men, giant creatures, ancient proph-ecies and epic battles. The CGI in this movie is amazing, and “Noah” reportedly cost about $125 million to make, but I still couldn’t shake the feeling that it was unnecessary. 
This was a film about conserva-
tion and the lengths man will go to 
do what he feels he must. Watching 
giant stone monsters fight the Huns from “Gladiator” feels like artistic compromise to a greedy studio.
Crowe gives a performance pret-
ty standard for him — all surly mas-culinity and wild beard — that is enough to satisfy but not to astound. The real standout performance 
comes from Oscar winner Jennifer 
Connelly (“A Beautiful Mind”) as Naameh, Noah’s wife. Connelly is the movie’s compassionate heart as a desperate, protective mother, and it was her I was rooting for — not Noah.
Ultimately, “Noah” overcomes 
its flaws and is one of the most origi-
nal cinematic visions in recent years. Though it takes vast liberties with 
the origin story of Noah and his ark — the end product feels more like an original work that happened to also be about a flood — admirers of the morality of Noah and his dedication to the preservation of life will come away satisfied.
I give it 4/5 stars.

SOMBER LYRICS WITH UPBEAT SOUNDS.

Avenue Writer
The debut album from Danish singer/
songwriter Mø, “No Mythologies to Follow,” 
adds yet another exciting entry to the grow-ing synthpop genre. Comparable to artists like Grimes and Purity Ring, Mø creates a 
unique vision accentuated by brilliant pro-
duction and lyrics filled with pathos.
While bands like Chvrches juxtapose dark 
subject matter with cheery instrumentals, Mø excels in aligning her somber lyricism with appropriately uncanny production. 
Stand-out song “Pilgrim” matches lyrics 
“Why do you and I live on and on?” with horns one would expect to hear in a hip-hop track. Mø’s voice, similar to Lana Del Rey’s, 
excellently delivers the pain-stricken lyr-
ics with delicate emotion. On “XXX 88,” the singer spices up the vocals with enough atti-tude to pull the listener in without potentially alienating her audience. A far cry from the of-ten whiny females of pop radio, Mø possesses a mature display of vocal manipulation.
The one fault of “No Mythologies To Fol-
low” lies in the often same-sounding tracks. 
Although most of the album registers, some 
songs get lost due to their inability to stand separate from one another. The album differ-entiates after multiple listens, but songs may blend together on first listen.
Mø succeeds in creating a great addition 
to the synthpop genre with “No Mythologies to Follow.” The album not only sets Mø apart from the competition, but also establishes her 
as a powerful female figure in music.Mø debuts synthpop album GatorAid

“How long should I wait to have sex with the guy I’m dating?”
— Anonymous
I don’t think there’s a time stamp created by the gods of seduction that says 
“TODAY’S THE DAY. ” You have to decide what you’re most comfortable with, and 
whether the person you’re thinking about getting down and dirty with is worth an extra tally on your — let’s face it — long list of wish-you-hadn’ts. One of my friends has a thing called the “three-date rule” that she sticks to no matter what. After three 
separate dates in three separate weeks, she feels she has spent enough time with 
this guy to give him the cookie. Guys are genetically programmed to not only desire the goods but also do whatever they possibly can to receive them. When a guy takes you on a date, it might very well be used as an attempt to get to know you, but in the long run, it’s to get to what really matters faster. He pays for your meals and expensive gifts, so in return, you’ll give him the only gift he actually wants. If you think about it this way, keep the cookie in the jar for as long as your happy place is physically able to so he doesn’t reach his endgame too soon. Create a rule for yourself if you think it’s worth it to stick to a plan each time, but if you need to jump 
his bones sooner than usual, go for it. It’s not your fault he’s walking around looking 
sexy. You have every right to pounce, and you should.

Shabazz Napier has more All-
Conference First-Team selections 
than Scottie Wilbekin. He has 
more career points than Patric Young and Will Yeguete com-bined. He had more minutes on 
the court in just his freshman year than Casey Prather had in nearly three years of action.
But most importantly, UConn’s 
senior point guard has more na-tional championship rings than 
any player on Florida’s roster. 
Unfortunately for coach Billy 
Donovan and the No. 1-seed 
Gators, Napier is having one of 
the best postseasons of his four-
year career.
“He has evolved into an elite 
guard in this country, as good as anybody out there,” Donovan 
said. “Certainly against us he 
made some really big shots com-ing down the stretch.”
In that Dec. 2 matchup in 
Storrs, Conn., no shot was bigger — or more painful for Gators fans — than Napier’s buzzer-beater that handed Florida its second and most recent loss of the sea-
son. 
That shot was Napier’s first 
and last career buzzer-beater, as 
well as inspiration for the Gators 
in at least one late-game scenario 
during the Southeastern Confer-ence Championship against Ken-tucky. 
Since dropping 26 points 
against Florida, Napier has aver-
aged 18.5 points per contest. 
In his four tournament games 
so far, the 6-foot-1 point guard 
has stepped up his scoring game 
even more by averaging 23.3 
points per contest, which is the most out of any player on any of the Final Four teams.
In UConn’s Elite Eight match-
up with Michigan State on Sun-day, the first-team All-American led all scorers with 25 points, 17 of which came in the second half. 
And when the Spartans jumped

When people talk about 
Connecticut, the attention 
generally focuses on Sha-
bazz Napier — the Huskies’ 
leading scorer and one of the most dynamic talents in the nation. But another player 
on UConn coach Kevin Ol-
lie’s roster has stepped up in a big way for his team in the postseason. 
Huskies forward DeAn-
dre Daniels has averaged 17 points on 50 percent shoot-ing and 6.8 rebounds per game during No. 7 seed 
Connecticut’s tournament 
wins against 10-seed Saint Joseph’s, 2-seed Villanova, 3-seed Iowa State and 4-seed Michigan State in the East 
Regional. 
In those games, he has 
stretched the floor for UConn, 
making 8 of 19 three-point 
attempts.
Daniels broke out in an 
81-76 win against Iowa State 
last Friday in the Sweet 16, 
scoring 27 points on a 10-of-
15 shooting clip and grab-bing 10 boards. 
“He’s a versatile for-
ward,” coach Billy Donovan said.  “He shoots threes.   He’s 
posting up.   He’s long, he’s 
athletic.  He can put it on the 
floor.   Kevin does a lot of great stuff with him to put 
him in situations where he 
can shoot the ball.   He can 
put it on the floor.   He can 
play out of the post.   But he’s 
a guy, I think, has progres-sively gotten better during the course of the season.”
Ollie has seen Daniels im-
prove over the past month 
and has praised the junior’s 
ability as a hybrid four to make the most out of his op-portunities on the floor.
“One word that we always 
talk to him about is touches — his touches comes from his activity,” Ollie said. 
“Offensive rebound, de-
fensive offensive rebound, taking charge, getting a deflection, getting a block.  
When he has over eight 
rebounds, he averages 19 
points.   That just goes right 
into the touches.  When he’s 
active, when he’s on the floor, when he’s on the court block-
ing shots, he’s going to get 
his points because he’s that talented.   He’s 6-foot-9, can 
play inside, can play out. 
“The biggest thing for 
him is to bring that energy.  
When he does that, he plays at another level.”
Daniels is second on 
UConn in scoring this year behind Napier, with 13 Huskies forward

When the Gators took to the field 
Wednesday night for a midweek game 
against the Seminoles, both teams were 
hungry for a win. It had been exactly a week since the 
Gators tasted victory following three 
consecutive road losses to Tennessee last week. Florida State, on the other hand, 
was eager to defend a 13-game winning 
streak — and it did.
No. 8 FSU (35-4, 12-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) defeated No. 6 UF (31-8, 5-7 
Southeastern Conference) 3-2 in eight in-
nings Wednesday night at Katie Seashole 
Pressly Stadium.
For the fourth time 
this season, the Gators went into extra in-
nings, but it was the first time they ended an eight-inning matchup with a loss. 
The last time Florida lost at least four games in a row was in 2011 when it 
dropped six straight contests from March 
25-April 3. 
Florida State’s Tiffani Brown, who was 
walked at the start of the eighth inning, 
scored the game-winning run for the Semi-
noles when Maddie O’Brien reached base on a fielder’s choice.
“I don’t think this one had anything to Florida State hands Florida home defeat in extra innings

UF coachmen’s bAsketbAlldo with the other,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“This was a good softball game; it could have went either way.” 
On Florida’s first at-bat of the game, 
Kelsey Stewart reached first base on a single, extending her on-base streak to 39 games. 
The sophomore shortstop stole second 
immediately after and then made it home off a right-side hit by Stephanie Tofft that also advanced Chelsea Herndon to third.  
A home run from Florida State’s Briana 
Hamilton in the top at the third inning evened things out at 1-1. 
Another home run for Florida State 
from O’Brien gave the Seminoles their first lead of the game at 2-1 in the top of the fourth inning. 
Florida’s last lost against Florida State 
came in Tallahassee on April 5, 2006. 
Since then, UF had won 11 consecu-tive games against FSU — until the two 
teams met for the first time this season on 
Wednesday.
“We’re doing the same thing in this 
game in games that we’ve won,” Walton said. “We just leave too many runners in 
scoring position. We’ve got to do a better 
job of executing our offense.”
Both Florida and Florida State recorded 
six hits.In the circle, Lauren Haeger started her 
eighth game of the season.
The Peoria, Ariz., native pitched the 
first four innings, allowing four hits, two runs and recording only one strikeout. 
“We didn’t play bad. We just can’t get a 
ball to fall our way,” Haeger said. 
“We just have to move on. I mean you 
can’t think, ‘Oh, we lost four in a row.’ You can’t think of it like that or you’re just 
going to be out of the game every time.”
After Florida tied things up in the bot-
tom of the fourth with an RBI double that  
scored Tofft, Delanie Gourley moved into the circle in the top of the fifth inning. 
With her four punchouts, Gourley be-
came the first Gator to break the 100-strike-out mark in 2014. 
Gourley allowed one hit and no runs in 
two innings pitched.
“I kind of hit a little minor rough patch 
but I was feeling good, nice and loose to-night and just going to hope to keep it up,” Gourley said.
Hannah Rogers, who was in the circle 
for the final two innings, took the loss on Wednesday night after allowing the game-winning run. 
“I thought all of our pitchers were 
good,” Walton said. “If they we’re great we would have won.” 
points per game, but the Los An-geles native has also been a force 
on the defensive end this postsea-
son. 
During the Huskies’ 60-54 win 
on Sunday in the Elite Eight, Dan-
iels shut down Spartans forward 
Branden Dawson, who averaged 20 points in his first three NCAA Tournament contests. 
In 34 minutes on the court, 
Dawson scored only five points on 1-of-3 shooting and did not see many offensive opportunities thanks to Daniels’ stingy defense 
on the block. The Michigan State 
junior recorded eight boards but only one on the offensive glass — an area in which he normally 
dominates.
“I just wanted to limit his post-
up touches, and it was just a great 
game plan that we had from our 
coaching staff,” Daniels said.  “I 
just wanted to keep him off the 
offensive rebounds, and that was our main focus.”
Florida point guard Scot-
tie Wilbekin remembers how dangerous Daniels was in both teams’ previous matchup on Dec. 2 in Storrs, Conn. In that game, the UConn forward recorded 14 
points on 6-of-10 shooting and 
seven boards in 37 minutes of ac-tion. 
Daniels’ most impactful play 
against the Gators was a back-tap 
on a missed jumper by Napier 
with only seconds left on the clock. 
The play gave Napier one more 
shot at winning the game, and he did just that on a buzzer-beating jumper on the right elbow to take 
the 65-64 victory. 
“A good player,” Wilbekin 
said of Daniels. “A nice four-man who can 
stretch and shoot the three, a guy who can also put it down. He’s 
a tough matchup because of his versatility.”
out to a nine-point advan-
tage with 16:34 on the clock, Napier scored seven of the 
Huskies’ next nine points to 
knot the game at 32 just more than four minutes later.
Because Napier has been 
a thorn in the side of every defense he has faced so far in the NCAA Tournament, Donovan said he can’t expect Wilbekin — a member of the 
SEC All-Defensive Team — 
to guard his counterpart all by himself.
“I’ve always believed that 
Scottie Wilbekin is a great de-fender and Napier is a great offensive player,” the 18-year coach said during Monday’s Final Four teleconference. 
“I always believe that 
great offense beats great de-fense.  So this is not neces-sarily going to be a situation 
where Scottie is going to be 
playing Napier by himself.  We’ve been a team, a defen-sive team, and we’ve got to try to do as good of a job as 
we can collectively helping 
Scottie in whatever situa-tion he may be in during the game.”During Florida’s previous 
contest against UConn, Wil-bekin was forced to leave the game with 3:01 remaining af-ter spraining his right ankle. 
While the Gators’ top back-
court defender was stuck in the locker room, Napier knocked down a three-point 
shot to tie the game, a free 
throw to put his squad up one and the mid-range jump-er to win the contest.
Now fully healthy, Wil-
bekin said he expects Napier and the rest of the Huskies shooters to have their best game of the season. 
However, he added he has 
faith in himself and his team-mates to shut down UConn’s shooters enough to pull out a victory and advance to Flori-
da’s first national champion-
ship game since 2007.
“The last time we played 
them, it was a good game,” Wilbekin said. “I think both 
teams played well. Close 
game the whole time. I think it’s a good matchup. I think it’s a game we can win. It’s 
not going to be easy, it will be 
tough. It’s going to be tough to match up with them and all their shooters, but I think 
we have a good chance.”THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Excitement is revolving around the UF track and 
ﬁ  eld team as it hosts the annual Pepsi Florida Relays 
starting today.
Able to stay home as they have been doing since the 
beginning of the indoor season back in January, the Gators get to compete on their own turf where they practice daily. 
“Anytime you can create a family type atmosphere, 
sleep in your own beds, eat your regular foods and stay in your workout routine, it’s a good thing,” coach Mike Holloway said.
“It’s exciting. It’s the Florida Relays. It’s a big deal 
here in Gainesville, and it’s a big deal in the state of Florida.” 
The Florida Relays ﬁ  rst began in 1939 and have car-
ried a 74-year tradition of incoming high school, col-
legiate and international participants from all over the 
world.
With what once started as 200 athletes competing in 
a one-day event, the Florida Relays have expanded to a three-day affair, attracting more than 3,000 competi-tors.
It ﬁ  rst became a big event because of the work former 
UF track coach Percy Beard brought to Florida. 
Now a nationally recognized event, the athletes hon-
or their home meet as one of the most memorable events of their careers.
“Starting with the freshman, they’re more than ex-
cited because they see the energy coming from the up-perclassmen,” senior sprinter Ebony Eutsey said. 
“Us as a whole team, we’re all on our party vibe. As a team we’re beyond happy, it being Florida Relays this 
coming weekend.”
Eutsey often reminisces on one of her favorite Flori-
da Relays moments, winning the 400-meter dash in her 
sophomore year in 52.07 seconds – currently her per-
sonal record. 
She was also a member of last year’s team that won 
the women’s 4x400-meter relay.
Although UF will be in the comfort of its facility for 
the competition through Saturday at the Percy Beard 
Track at James G. Pressly Stadium, distractions cannot get in the way. 
Junior jumper Marquis Dendy, who just came off a 
long jump title at the Clyde Littleﬁ  eld Texas Relays last weekend in Austin, Texas, prepares himself in the same  fashion regardless of the location of the meet. 
“No matter if it’s a home meet or an away meet, you 
always have to come to it with the aspect knowing that 
this is a meet regardless if its home or if it’s in California 
or Delaware,” Dendy said. 
 “It does bring more excitement being a home meet, 
but at the end you still have got to go ahead with the 
same focus, same mentality and hit your marks. 
“There’s going to be a better home crowd that are go-
ing to be on your side, don’t get carried away with the 
crowd, but you also have to come here and realize it’s a home meet, another day in the ofﬁ  ce.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 3, 2014
