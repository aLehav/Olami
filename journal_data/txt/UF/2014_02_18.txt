Jon Anderson, 67, poses in part of his interactive bamboo art exhibit, which is scheduled to be torn down in the next three days after UF ordered him to remove it.

Once again, UF is removing Jon 
Anderson’s bamboo guerilla art 
from campus.  
The 67-year-old retired school-
teacher and Florida Museum vol-
unteer created the art installation in 
March 2013. It features an eclectic mix of bamboo art structures both towering and tiny that Anderson called “the middleground between Kanapaha Gardens and Satchel’s.”
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said Anderson was served a notice Monday stating he had 72 hours to 
remove Bambooville from UF prop-
erty or to speak with the physical plant division if he needs to make other arrangements. 
“While this art may be pleasing 
to many, if we allowed one person, 
we would have to allow many,” Sikes said.
However, this was not Ander-
son’s ﬁ  rst tangle with UF over Bam-
booville. 
In 2012, the artist ﬁ  rst began add-
ing bamboo structures to the Bar-
tram Carr woods area. In December, 
a member of the UF grounds crew discovered the art and tore it down. 
Early last year, he went before 
the University Lakes, Vegetation and Landscape Committee to ask permission to build his structure on UF conservation area. 
After receiving what he said was 
a negative response to the idea, An-derson withdrew his request.
“I thought I was putting this up 
under the umbrella of the green-house,” he said.
He visited UF’s map room to 
check if the area he was eyeing for the newest iteration of Bambooville was allowed and said he was told 
there was “no delineation between 
greenhouse land and woodlands land.”
But after UF’s decision Monday, 
Anderson said he’s ready to move on. He plans to pack his art Tuesday ‘Bambooville’ to be 
cut from UF campus

Today marks the ﬁ  rst day of voting 
for Student Government elections.
Students will be able to cast their 
votes today and Wednesday at any of 
the 12 polling locations on campus. Each of them will open at 8:30 a.m.
All locations but the CSE main room 
will remain open until 8:30 p.m. That lo-cation will close at 5 because of schedul-ing conﬂ  icts, said Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover. Voters who get there after 5 p.m. will be redirected to Marston Li-brary.In addition to the candidates, two 
referendum questions and one constitu-tional amendment will be on the ballot.
One of the questions asks students 
if they support implementing an open-container policy allowing those of legal drinking age to carry an open container of alcohol on campus during home foot-ball games. The second question asks if students support a 50-cent-per-credit-hour fee that would be used to fund energy efﬁ  ciency and renewable energy projects on campus.
Referendums gauge student opinion 
and do not directly impact administra-tion or SG policies.

After government attempts to silence op-
position in Venezuela, UF students are ﬁ  ght-
ing to give the people a voice.
Last week, three Venezuelans were shot 
dead, and dozens were injured or detained after anti-government protests sparked chaos in the capital.  
In response, Venezuelan native Andreina 
Nash, a 21-year-old UF marketing and tele-communication junior, said she spent 12 hours creating a YouTube video.
“What’s going on in Venezuela in a nut-
shell” has gone viral, with more than 1.6 mil-lion views since Friday.
Nash said she’s been called the voice of Venezuela and asked to translate her video into several languages.
“I’ll stand up for any injustices that are 
happening,” she said, “and for any young person that feels like they don’t have a future in their own country.”
Nash and dozens of supporters stood on 
the corner of University Avenue and North-west 13th Street on Monday holding signs, displaying Venezuelan ﬂ  ags and singing the country’s national anthem.
Nash said the protest wasn’t about politics 
but was instead about supporting the youth. 
She said many of the university’s Venezu-
elan students are in the United States to learn English and will return when their visas ex-pire.
“They’re ﬁ  ghting outside because they 
want to go back to a better Venezuela,” she said.
Center for Latin American Studies direc-
tor Philip J. Williams said Venezuelan UF stu-dents turned to protesting because they feel helpless.Students speak up for Venezuela

Open containers, new fee on ballot
the open-container referendum, and spokes-
woman Susan Webster said the party is in favor 
of the green referendum question but thinks 
students should have the ﬁ  nal say. 
“We do believe that because it would in-
crease the cost of education for students at the 
University of Florida, students should have the 
ultimate decision,” she said. 
Students Party spokesman Alex Klayman 
said his party supports the open-container 
referendum question but does not back the 50-
cent-per-credit-hour referendum for a green 
energy fee.
“The party supports the answer ‘NO’ on 
the 50-cent per credit-hour fee,” he wrote in an 
email. “Though the referendum is non-binding, 
there is no reason we should be raising fees for 
a Green Energy Fee when we aren’t even taking all the steps we could be without raising fees.”
In addition to the referendum questions, the 
ballot will include a potential amendment ask-
ing if the SG anti-discrimination policy should be updated to include genetic information.
“By including genetic information in the 
nondiscriminatory clause, we are ensuring that the student organizations and Student Govern-ment have uniform requirements,” Webster said. 
Klayman also said his party is in favor of the 
amendment.
“Updating our constitution to better follow 
anti-discrimination laws is a no-brainer, and making everyone feel welcome/accepted at UF is a positive for every student,” he wrote.
Micaela Montero Dokser, Taco Libre Party 
candidate for Student Body treasurer, said the party will side with students on all three issues, as its main focus is to try to get Taco Bell back.ELECTIONS , from page 1POLLING LOCATIONS (Feb 18-19, 2014)

Candidates for the March city elections dis-
cussed Gainesville’s state of affairs Monday 
night at the Alachua County Democratic Black Caucus debate.
Eight of the ten candidates who qualified 
for the upcoming elections attended the debate held in the County Administration Building.
Candidates answered questions posed by 
Charles Goston, former president of the cau-cus, and Ermon Owens, its current president.
The candidates vying for a three-year term 
on the city commission discussed issues rang-ing from increasing GRU rates to the biomass plant.
District 2 candidates Cheri Brodeur, a UF 
faculty member, and incumbent Todd Chase participated in the first half of the debate.
Brodeur said city commissioners can no 
longer plan far into the future when making important decisions, like the one that led to the implementation of the biomass plant.
“We are making plans for things so far 
down the road,” she said. “I’m going to be long dead by the time they are done with it.”
In the second half of the debate, at-large 
Seat 2 candidate Mark Venzke said Gainesville needs to find a way to break off from the bio-mass plant contract.
“That decision was made behind closed doors without the scrutiny of citizens and all of that frankly is wrong, if not illegal,” he said.
Other candidates debated issues like city 
commissioners’ civility at public meetings.  
At-Large Seat 2 candidate Annie Orlando 
said city commissioners have become arro-gant after being in power for so long.
“When we have leadership that doesn’t 
respect citizens, you can’t expect much in re-turn,” she said.
One recurring topic of the night was how 
Gainesville’s poorer areas are currently coping with increasing utility rates.
Goston said GRU has not spent any money 
on the financial deficit of Gainesville’s citizen-ry. The biomass plant led to a spike in utility rates in October. 
“Their utilities went from $2,000 a month to 
between $4,000 and $5,000 a month,” he said.
With the upcoming elections, citizens need 
to start doing more to research the platforms of their politicians, Goston said.
“GRU has become the living nightmare for 
a lot of people,” Gotson said. “People are look-ing to wake up from the nightmare.” Candidates talk biomass plant, GRU rates at Monday debate
Some UF Venezuelans feel helpless
“It’s a small symbolic act,” he said, “but I think it’s 
important nonetheless to draw attention to develop -
ments there.”
Williams said a lot of the dissatisfaction in the 
country comes from the economic situation, leav-
ing many students worried about post-graduation opportunities.
Atilio Atencio, a 19-year-old UF biochemistry 
sophomore from Valera, Venezuela, said every-
thing is scarce in his home country.
That includes toilet paper and toothpaste — now 
luxury items.
He said Harina P.A.N., the corn meal used in 
many popular Venezuelan foods, isn’t available.
Atencio said two of his cousins were involved in 
demonstrations in the college town of Merida, but 
they weren’t hurt.Students are the ones protesting because they are 
the most educated, he said.
“It’s a matter of publicity,” Atencio said. “The 
more the world is aware, the more they’re going to 
push for change.”
However, Williams, who is also a professor of 
political science and Latin American studies, said 
the U.S. shouldn’t get involved if human rights 
aren’t being violated.
“Venezuelans have to determine their future,” 
he said. “It’s a sovereign country… and it’s not our 
government’s place to take sides.”
Still, Nash said she plans to fight as long as it 
takes. 
She said she hopes the last video she dedicates 
to her country is one of Venezuela with liberty and democracy.
“I have a feeling that this time it will be differ-
ent,” Nash said. “Our voices will be heard.”VEnEzuELA , from page 1

MIAMI — A South Florida 
artist is facing a criminal charge 
after police say he smashed a $1 million vase at Miami’s new art museum to protest what he 
called its favoritism for interna-
tional rather than local art.
Maximo Caminero, 51, was 
charged with criminal mischief after Sunday’s incident at the Perez Art Museum Miami. According to a Miami Police Department arrest affidavit, a guard told officers Caminero 
picked up a colored vase by 
Chinese dissident artist Ai Wei-wei. When told to put it down, the security guard said Camine-ro smashed it on the floor.
According to a police af-
fidavit, Caminero told officers he broke the vase to protest the museum’s lack of local artist 
displays and because “the mu-
seum only displayed interna-tional artists’ art.”
Caminero, a painter who 
lives in Miami, declined com-ment when reached by tele-phone Monday. 
The police affidavit lists the 
value of the vase as $1 million, 
quoting the museum’s secu-
rity officials. Criminal mischief can be a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison when the property damaged is worth more than $1,000.
Caminero had a recent 
showing at the JF Gallery in West Palm Beach that offered a patrons a chance to meet him and “view a sampling of the work from his 30-year career as an artist.”
According to PAMM’s site, 
the vase is one of more than a 
dozen that are part of a floor in-
stallation. Each vase is partially 
painted in bright colors.
Behind the installation are a 
series of three black-and-white 
photos showing Ai holding a vase and then letting it drop to the ground, smashing into pieces.
The Ai Weiwei: According 
to What? exhibit runs through 
March 16 at the museum. Mu-
seum officials confirmed the in-cident in a Monday email, and noted that an upcoming show will feature a local artist, Mi-ami’s Edouard Duval-Carrié. The Haitian-born artist’s show, beginning March 13, is titled “Imagined Landscapes.”
A sculptor, designer and 
documentary-maker, Ai has irked Beijing by using his art and online profile to draw at-tention to injustices in China and the need for greater trans-parency and rule of law. He was detained for 81 days in 2011 during a crackdown on 
dissent. After his release in 
June 2011, Ai’s design firm was slapped with a $2.4 million tax bill, which he fought unsuccess-fully in the Chinese courts.Florida artist

Students want to fight the university’s decision to eliminate it
and is inviting members of the community to 
help.
“If they will take some things and put them 
in the truck, then they can take some things and put them in their car,” he said.
Elliot Larkin, a 23-year-old UF manage-ment master’s student, recently began help-
ing Anderson, who has Parkinson’s disease, 
groom and decorate Bambooville. 
He said he will be going through all of the 
appropriate channels to fight UF’s decision.
“I’m hoping they’re going to make an ex-
ception based on the extraordinary circum-stances,” he said.Zack Carter, a 19-year-old UF health sci-
ence freshman, discovered Bambooville this semester while searching for his biology lab. Enchanted, he brought his girlfriend back to experience the “unique and eye-catching” art.
“It’s like a cool secret,” he said. “Something 
you stumble upon and want to share with oth-ers.”Anderson said although he is sad he can no 
longer share his project with students and resi-dents, he’ll mostly miss seeing the happiness Bambooville brings to visitors.
“People who visit have a wonderful posi-
tive energy that just glows around them, and I’m lucky enough to get to experience it,” he said.

At an abortion awareness event 
held Monday on the Plaza of the 
Americas, speakers told Gators abortion is something college women and men both have a stake in.
Kendra Vincent, chairwoman 
of the Gainesville chapter of the 
National Women’s Liberation, said 
the event was a response to some of the legislation that has been pro-posed and passed in other states that some women’s rights activists believe were put in place to im-
pede abortion. 
“They know they can’t over-
turn Roe v. Wade,” Vincent said, 
“so they’re chipping away at it.”
The speak-out was meant to 
raise awareness on campus and at-tract as many people as possible, Vincent said. 
“The idea behind this is that 
women are really the experts when it comes to making decisions about their body, about health care, about whether or not they want to have children or when they want to have children,” Vincent said. 
Katie Walters, one of the fea-
tured speakers, said she had an abortion five years ago while she was in college. 
She said she knew an abortion 
was something she had to do, and with help from her friend, who worked at an abortion clinic, she was able to make the process as easy as possible.
“You just expect it to be this 
really awful thing, and it really 
wasn’t,” Walters said.
Patrick Runfeldt, a UF English 
senior, attended the speak-out 
and said he agreed with what the women said.
“I don’t know anything about 
being pregnant,” Runfeldt said. “There is no way that any man should be able to decide the rights

A new health insurance website, launched 
through UF Health Shands Hospital, has been 
formed to help newly admitted students and their families purchase or prove their health insurance.
Mary Kay Schneider Carodine, assistant 
vice president for student affairs, said the site, 
studentinsurance.shcc.ufl.edu, was created 
to help families see the UF requirements for health insurance.
“When students receive admission to UF,” 
she said, “they will receive information in 
there about one of the conditions of enroll-ment being health insurance.”
If new students don’t prove that they have 
health insurance, they will be automatically 
enrolled into the policy that will appear on 
their UF bill 30 days before classes, Carodine said.
“Based on our research with other institu-
tions that have mandatory health insurance, about 80 percent of students tend to be already covered by insurance through their parents,” she said.
For the students who choose to enroll in 
UF’s health care, financial aid money can now be used toward health insurance because the university has made it mandatory, Carodine said. That rule only applies to students en-rolled in six or more credits.
Katherine Lindsey, assistant director of 
health administration at the Student Health Care Center, said upon looking at a list of the 
top 25 public schools in America, UF President Bernie Machen found many of them required 
health insurance for enrollment.
The decision to make health insurance 
mandatory at UF, made in March 2013, was a joint effort between the Student Health Care Center, the Student Affairs Office and the Stu-dent Government, she said.
“We want students to be healthy,” Lindsey 
said.
Some students aren’t feeling good about 
the shift to mandatory health care.
Andrew Bryan, a UF accounting combined-
degree fifth-year student, said mandatory in-surance seems like more of a burden.
“In theory it might sound all rosy, but in 
reality, I see it being more cost to the already 
debt-ridden college student,” Bryan, 21, said.UF site to help families figure out mandatory health insurance

NAPLES — Alexander Gold-
stein was watching the pairs skat-
ers at the Olympics Sunday — with his ears.
From his cozy studios at ABG 
World, LLC in North Naples, Goldstein could take apart every piece of music that is played in the “Iceberg” Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia, over the next week.
A fair number of them will be 
his own creations. Goldstein is something of an Olympian himself among sports music programmers, 
having edited music for 38 gold-
medal ice skating programs and at least as many silver medals.
“I counted. There are 104 com-
peting, and Alex has worked with 26 of them,” said his wife, Marina Berkovich. She and her husband don’t wait for primetime coverage; they’ve been streaming Olympic 
ice competition live over the last 
week. Goldstein-edited music is behind Canadians and Russians, as well as U.S. leaders — Meryl Davis and Charlie White.
Goldstein has edited competi-
tion music for Korea, Japan and nearly every Western country. In fact, he programmed the music behind the first ice dance competi-tion to be sanctioned by the Olym-pics Federation in 1976. Lyudmila Pakhomova and Aleksandr Gor-shkov, Russians, as was Goldstein, won it.
“Everything was different in 
those days. You had to work with tapes — it was so much harder,” Goldstein said. “Now it’s all done on the computer.”
That doesn’t make the work 
easy. When Davis and White take to the ice on Monday, skating to Rimsky-Korsakov’s romantic 
“Scheherazade,” it will be only af-
ter a compilation that has had to do its own epic ice jumps.
What TV watchers will hear is 
his careful blending of just three  versions, choosing among phrases from each of them to insert the nec-essary rhythm where the program calls for it and to extend or cut a 
phrase to work with a lift, a jump 
or a compulsory move. While Rimsky-Korsakov might scratch his head, Goldstein surgically con-nects the pieces so seamlessly most viewers are sure they heard a sin-gle work.
International Skating Union 
judges must approve the music 
before it’s used. Goldstein learned 
long ago that incorporating a de-tectable little fillip that will help them keep the beat is critical.
“The judges aren’t music ex-
perts,” he explained. “They’re skat-ing experts. They’re straight about this. If they can’t keep the rhythm, they won’t allow the music.”
Goldstein can’t skate.“No,” he said with a sheepish 
smile. “Never. I’ll let the coaches who can get on the ice handle that part of it.”

Swamp, but with 
footnotes
Endorsing Student Government parties is always difﬁ  cult, 
and in an election season that saw unprecedented events, we found it even harder. Swamp is the only party with a 
full executive ticket, but we have serious reservations about en-couraging the growth of a one-party system — especially when 
that one party has a history of corruption.
But Swamp is the only group that has mobilized successfully, 
set feasible goals and proved its members are qualiﬁ  ed.
So, here it goes: The Alligator endorses the Swamp Party’s 
executive ticket for the Spring 2014 elections — with footnotes.
The state of SG is disheartening. It’s overwhelmingly run by 
Swamp, and the only way to start ﬁ  xing that is to make Student 
Senate more diverse. For that reason, the Alligator also endorses all of the Students and Taco Libre candidates for Senate.
Swamp presents some good ideas. We love the proposed in-
stallation of more microwaves on campus — seriously, it’d be so much cheaper to make ramen between classes instead of buying Subway — and the planned lobbying for standardized taxi cab rates. In previous years, Swamp has been criticized for making extravagant, unrealistic promises in hopes of enticing voters, and although not all of its platform points this year seem doable — decreasing the cost of access codes? Come on — most can be accomplished. 
We particularly liked that Student Body president candi-
date Cory Yeffet said he’d be a vocal member of the university’s Board of Trustees. Many presidents, like Tj Villamil and Chris-tina Bonarrigo, have been more or less silent during the meetings in which they were the only student voices who could comment on issues like tuition hikes.
UF students need the Student Body president to speak up. 
The board is out of touch with students’ needs, and without proper representation by the SBP on our behalf, its power will 
go unchecked. 
Yeffet promises he’ll be loud. We hope he is. 
Also, we have full faith in treasurer candidate and all-around 
good guy Elliot Grasso. He knows how to handle money, he knows how student orgs work, and he knows how to help them. 
Moving on. This year, Swamp showed it cares about SG by presenting an 
achievable, well-thought-out plan. We support Taco Libre’s mis-
sion of making students care more about SG, and we think they 
succeeded by keeping it interesting. However, disorganization is not an excuse for failing to muster up executive tickets for both Students and Taco Libre parties. Students Party presented vague platform points — no prices, no plans. Taco Libre had a simple platform but lacked speciﬁ  cs about its feasibility. 
To future minority parties, we say: The minority has to play 
the majority at its own game. It’s not enough to advocate for votes based solely on the fact that you’re the underdog. You need to be 
just as savvy and just as strategically driven as Swamp. 
Regardless of this endorsement, though, we really just want 
students to vote. All you need is your Gator 1 Card (or a photo 
ID plus your UF-ID number) and a concern for UF’s future.UF student leadership controlled by System
March 14, 2000, was a historic day. Charles Grapski 
left the Alachua County Courthouse to grab a 
bagel only to come back to hear that the verdict 
was ready. When the jury gave its ruling, Grapski was in 
tears. 
A total of $6 million in damages was awarded to Grapski 
for the defamation he suffered as a former UF Student Government candidate. 
To understand the verdict, you have to go back some 
years. In 1923, a leadership honorary, Florida Blue Key, was formed at UF and soon became highly inﬂ  uential. As one analyst put it in 2004, “the doors to the governor’s mansion, Legislature and judiciary in Florida all seemed to unlock with a Blue Key.”
But as in all institutions, things started going astray. 
Since getting into FBK was vital to becoming successful after graduating from UF, its membership became tied with 
student politics, and not in a pleasant way. 
By 1995, the world knew the proverbial had hit the fan. 
In that year’s Spring elections, Charles Grapski ran for the 
Student Body presidency, making a fatal mistake. He ran as an independent — not realizing that he was upsetting the 
System that controls the UF Student Government. 
Soon, ﬂ  iers appeared across campus, falsely claiming 
that Grapski was a convicted child molester. After losing 
the election, Grapski went to the Eighth Judicial Circuit 
in Alachua County, suing FBK for its collusion with the 
System. 
Even before the jury gave the verdict, it was clear that 
FBK worked hand-in-hand with the Greek coalition that controls UF student politics.
A judicial notice conﬁ  rmed that FBK “has historically 
employed a house and group system of control over members and aspiring members to determine candidates for student government elected and appointed ofﬁ  ces, Florida Blue Key membership and slates of candidates to run for 
student government ofﬁ  ces...” 
The jury went further, ruling that FBK had defamed 
Grapski “through a conspiracy.”
Although the names and faces have changed over the years, the culture of corruption 
persists.
Two years ago, an Alligator 
investigation revealed how FBK membership is controlled by a “powerful few,” with anonymous sources saying that membership in the prestigious honorary depended on “backroom deals” 
among UF’s multicultural and 
Greek groups.
At the time, the Alligator noted that the new FBK class — 
picked by leaders from Theta Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Alpha 
Epsilon Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Alpha Epsilon Pi — 
was “nearly devoid of diversity,” with only six members 
from minority clubs. 
Although it might seem like the Greek coalition is racist, 
there was another reason for the lack of diversity.
That year, the System, which usually dominates campus 
politics despite representing a fraction of the student population, almost lost. The minority community that aligns itself with the System was blamed for its low voter turnout.
Unlike the Greek community, minority groups — Asian 
American Student Union, Black Student Union and Hispanic Student Association — have their hands tied when it comes to using coercive tactics; all they can do is encourage their 
members, nothing more. 
Contrast that to 2010, when sororities were recorded 
to have bribed their members with alcohol for voting and 
punished non-voting members by withholding food.
This, my friends, is UF at its worst. 
Next week, I will suggest practical steps on how we can 
begin to tackle this systemic corruption. 
Until then — particularly when the front page Thursday 
inevitably shows folks from the System celebrating their 
election victories the night before — let’s enjoy ourselves. 
After all, how many Americans, without traveling to the 
Middle East, can ever experience such undemocracy?

Vote yes on the Student Green Energy 
Fund
While students are looking over party 
platforms in the upcoming Student Gov-
ernment election, there is another issue that they need to be informed on prior to voting. I, along with other students, gath-
ered enough signatures for a nonbinding 
referendum on green energy to be placed on this semester’s SG ballot. 
This non-binding referendum will ask 
students if they support the creation of a 50-cent-per-credit-hour fee increase for a green-energy fund. A nonbinding refer-endum means the result would not have a direct effect, but it is used to gauge student 
interest. If enough students support the 
referendum, then it will show the Board of Trustees that students at the University of Florida are serious about clean energy. 
The money collected from the fee would 
go toward funding energy efﬁ  ciency and renewable energy projects, such as build-ing retroﬁ  tting, installing solar panels and changing out energy-inefﬁ  cient light bulbs. The money the school saves in electricity because of a project would be put back into 
the fund to invest in even more green-en-
ergy projects. With an average annual en-ergy bill of $40 million, these savings could have an enormous impact. 
When students hear the word “fee,” the 
ﬁ  rst question they want answered is what the cost for them will be. This is the low-est fee increase ever proposed. It would cost the average student about $6 to $8 but 
would generate up to $600,000 per year. 
The Student Body has shown support 
for the student green-energy fee in the 
past. In 2008, a green-energy fee referen-dum passed with 78 percent support. In the Spring of 2012, a resolution unanimously passed SG Senate supporting a green-ener-gy fee. 
Other schools, including the University of South Florida, have a green fee, and it has been working well for them. I’m urging all students to vote yes on the green-ener-gy fund, so we can make the University of 
Florida greener, which will lead to a better 
campus and a better Earth for all of us.

 SG elections open today
Voting for Student Government elec-
tions begins today and will continue to-morrow from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. This is the students’ chance to voice their opinions on what direction they want their Student 
Government to take and how they want to 
be represented on this campus.
I urge all students to educate themselves 
on the platforms that each party on cam-pus is presenting. Talk to the candidates who correspond to your class standing, ask them about what they hope to achieve if they are elected, and most importantly, tell them what you want to see happen.
Elections are an opportunity for stu-
dents to have a discussion on what they want, and more importantly, an opportu-nity to continue these conversations once 
elections are over because Student Govern-
ment is a yearlong conversation between students and their elected representatives.
Every vote today and tomorrow counts. 
Elections all over have been decided by slim margins and even in some cases by one vote — your vote could be the one.
So when you are walking across cam-
pus and a party representative asks, “Have 
you voted today?” proudly display your “I 
voted” sticker because you have exercised your democratic right to vote as a student at the University of Florida.
Together for tomorrow.

Swamp Party President Letters to the Editor
The best Valentine’s Day surprise for some may have come in a small package in the shape of actress Ellen Page. The 26-year-old “tiny Canadian,” as she describes herself on Twitter, 
known for “Juno,” ofﬁ  cially announced she’s gay at a Las Vegas event sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign on Friday.
Some may wonder why this is news; either because “My Ellen-
Page gaydar has been going off since 2009,” or “It’s 2014. Isn’t everybody gay these days?” While I understand both of these reactions, it’s still a big deal for a celebrity to publicly come out.
Even though Page coming out was 
about as shocking as ﬁ  nding there is a long line at a campus Starbucks between 
class changes, it is still important for the 
LGBT community. And yes, even though it is 2014 and people have become more accepting of different sexu-alities, no, not everyone is gay. According to a 2012 Gallup poll, 3.4 percent of Americans identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgen-der, which, although a signiﬁ  cant portion of the population, is still a minority.
Americans are also becoming more supportive. A 2013 Gallup 
poll found that 52 percent of Americans would vote for a federal 
law legalizing same-sex marriages in all 50 states, which has grown 
sharply from 32 percent who said the same in a 2004 ABC News/Washington Post poll. However, there are still many setbacks to equality. On Feb. 11, the Kansas House of Representatives ap-proved a bill allowing anti-gay segregation. When passed, the law “will allow any individual, group, or private business to refuse to serve gay couple if ‘it would be contrary to their sincerely held reli-gious beliefs,’” according to Slate magazine.
Yet, there has been progress. The attitude in Hollywood toward 
LGBT people has noticeably changed. When the dancing Ellen of talk-show fame came out 17 years ago, in April 1997, Degeneres’ award-winning sitcom was canceled within a year.
Now, Page’s announcement is somewhat softened by the recent 
“coming outs” of other actors such as Jim Parsons, Victor Garber and Zachary Quinto. Neil Patrick Harris’ sexual preference hasn’t kept him from becoming a star on “How I Met Your Mother” and grossing $15 million per season for the show. And Ellen Degeneres recently won her 14th People’s Choice Award.
Though the “star persona” is an inﬂ  uential part in which roles 
actors are cast, I doubt this announcement will hurt Page’s career.
However, some question whether Page was really brave for 
coming out. There are critiques like, “So, she’s gay? So what? That doesn’t mean she deserves a gold medal.”
Just because she came out in a more accepting atmosphere in 
front of LGBT youth at a Human Rights Campaign doesn’t make her any less brave. Sharing anything deeply personal about your-self warrants commendation, especially when you are in a position 
of power and you have the opportunity to inspire others.
Her coming out is not more important than anyone else’s, but it 
does have a wider effect. I’m proud of Page for using her position to 
create conversation and doing so in a very eloquent speech at that.
And like Page noted, she couldn’t have been standing on that 
stage delivering those words if it weren’t for all of the lesser-known, but just as notable, advocates behind the campaign.

The UF Student Senate has again 
proven to be poorly imitating the anti-democratic actions of the U.S. 
Congress. Is it a coincidence that just weeks after the Student Senate tried to pass its own 
oppressive resolution concerning Israel, the 
U.S. Congress is now attempting to do the same?
The propaganda, described as legislation, being 
brought forth in our local and national legislatures is a vicious attack on civil liberties.
Legislation such as this necessitates an obvious ques-
tion be asked: Do public institutions of higher education have the right to object to U.S. foreign policy?
On campus, a resolution condemning actions in sup-
port of the movement to boycott, divest and sanction — BDS — Israel for its continual violation of human rights was argued at the last public senate meeting of the se-mester. Dozens of community members attended and spoke to criticize an attack on our right to freedom of expression. The resolution was not voted on.
Similarly, in Washington, a bipartisan bill called the 
Protect Academic Freedom Act was introduced on the House ﬂ  oor Feb. 4. The bill aims to deny public subsi-
dies if academic organizations participate in the BDS 
movement.  
Legislators and special-interest groups recognize the 
threat BDS poses to the U.S.’ relationship with Israel, and they are now attempting to gag those who would protest the crimes against humanity com-mitted by the U.S. and Israel.
Carbon copies of this legislation are being 
proposed in state legislatures in New York and Maryland as well — all of which seek 
to justify attacks on civil liberties through 
baseless appeals to “anti-semitism” and “academic free-
dom.” The theme of “academic freedom” is not unique to this bill. Dozens of other bills have been submitted with similar titles. The phrase “academic freedom” as it appears in the titles of legislation all over the U.S. of-ten refers to the same thing — teaching of non-scientiﬁ  c ideas, like creationism and its twin sibling intelligent de-sign, in public science classrooms.
The congruity of rhetoric among supporters of Israeli 
crimes and those who would be as bold to deny evolu-tion is no coincidence. The late American historian Rich-ard Hofstadter pointed out more than 50 years ago the prominent and ongoing theme of anti-intellectualism in American life: “American education can be praised ... on many counts; but I believe ours is the only educational system in the world vital segments of which have fallen into the hands of people who joyfully and militantly 
proclaim their hostility to intellect...”
From the Reitz to the Capitol, anti-intellectualism is 
a dominating force in the U.S. that must constantly be 
negated.

Speaking Out
I         was extremely surprised 
at Students Party minor-ity leader Michael Christ 
for calling Taco Libre party “pathetic” and “insulting” in an article in the Alligator.
This much, everyone agrees on: The 
System’s corruption — which goes by the name of Swamp Party these days — is intolerable. But equally intolerable is the leader of a party with only a few seats in SG calling another party “pa-
thetic” and “insulting.”
As one of the original members of 
the Students Party, it isn’t easy for me 
to admit there’s been a steep decline in the party’s outlook for the past two years. Ineffective campaigning, plat-forms and senators have exacerbated the situation.  All I see nowadays are Students Party senators trying to be 
“professional” and befriend the sena-
tors from the System. Opposition sena-tors, in a misguided attempt to create “bipartisanship,” have only made their positions weaker, much to the delight of the System.
In last year’s campaign, 
I tried my best to reverse this trend. Unfortunately,  
the egoism prevalent in the already weak Students Party has ruined any chances of tackling the corruption of the System.
That is why I left and have not re-
turned. I was hoping either the party’s attitude changed or the party itself 
crumbled. I am not in the minority on 
this issue, either. The newly formed Taco Libre Party is composed of former Students senators and executive mem-bers. In fact, Taco Libre is being run and supported by some of the most loyal past party members who spent their blood, sweat and tears establishing the party and bringing it to its zenith. 
Christ’s issue with the press was 
wholly improper, which is not surpris-ing since the inability of Students Party to handle the press for the last two years is another contributing factor to the party’s decline.
It was clear Christ’s hating on Taco 
Libre was hugely embarrassing for the entire party when campaigners wrote a letter to the editor defending him in a last-ditch attempt for damage control.
There have been single-issue parties 
in the past such as the Keg Party and the Pants Party, whose slogan was “You’re Invited.” These parties increase inter-est in Student Government, which can 
beneﬁ  t a minority in the long run. Stu-
dents Party was successful in the past because we focused on single issues like unnecessary tuition hikes and pre-serving independent newspaper boxes. I say all of this as a friend. I say this as a wake-up call to the Students Party to actually start doing things effectively. And, yes, I am ofﬁ  cially supporting the 
#TacoRebellion.

Alachua County Sheriff’s 
deputies arrested an Alabama 
man Monday morning after police said he was “tweaking” on drugs and driving in circles 
around a Hardee’s parking lot.
Deputies arrested 29-year-
old Chad Robert Weltlich on 
charges of cocaine possession and drug equipment possession, according to an arrest report.
At about 12:15 a.m., an em-
ployee at the Hardee’s located at 7300 W. Newberry Road re-
ported a car circling the parking 
lot for about 30 minutes.  
When a deputy arrived, the 
car pulled into the drive-thru even though the restaurant was closed. The officer stopped the car, driven by Weltlich, and no-ticed he was shaking and stut-tering when he spoke.Weltlich told the deputy he 
was ordering food and insisted he wasn’t intoxicated, accord-ing to the report. He also said there were two other people in the car, but when officers didn’t see anyone in the car, Weltlich 
said he forgot they already left 
with his dad. Weltlich also said he was moving from Miami to Alabama then changed his story and said he was moving from Miami to Panama City.
Deputies saw a glass pipe 
with a circular bowl on the driv-er side of Weltlich’s car.
After searching the car, law 
enforcement found 0.7 grams of cocaine and a Hardee’s bag with two warm burgers inside, according to the report. Weltlich denied any knowledge of the pipe and the cocaine.

The challenge is an alter-

“We’ll be building for five 
days. We’ll be putting in dry-wall, painting, roofing,” said vice president of community service Amber Paoloemilio. “We wanted to go to Asheville to help out a new commu-

In the release, Taylor, a redshirt junior, said, “The Students 
Party has every student’s best interest at heart. They don’t just represent individual ‘blocs’ or special interests. They represent every student.”
Fowler, a sophomore, said in the release, “After witnessing Student Government elections for four semesters, we’ve seen 
first hand the corruption and inefficacy of the Swamp Party … 
the student body deserves better.”
This isn’t the first time a member of the football program 
has endorsed Students Party. Coach Will Muschamp endorsed player and vice president candidate Jesse Schmitt in 2012. 
Students Party spokesman Alex Klayman said the two foot-
ball players are friends with the Students Party’s health and 
human performance Senate candidate, Jacob Gabriel, and they 
expressed their interest in endorsing the party.
Klayman said he’s happy but isn’t surprised.“We’re the right choice for every student, not just the ste-
reotypical GDI … Our athletics agree: If you’re not a part of the system, then you’re not benefiting from the system,” he said.
Taco Libre Party Student Body treasurer candidate Micaela 
Montero Dosker said her party has no official endorsements. 
Swamp Party spokeswoman Susan Webster declined to 
comment.Gator football starters endorse Students Party in SG electionsCAMPUS

The upcoming Public Interest Environmental Con-
ference will give attendees a chance to learn about legal 
issues facing the environment and modern agriculture.
The UF Levin College of Law and the UF Environ-
mental Land Use Law Program will host the 20th annual 
event Thursday through Saturday. It is open to the pub-
lic, and tickets are free for UF students, faculty and staff. The conference is called Feeding the Future: Shrinking Resources, Growing Population and a Warming Planet.
Conference co-chair Chris Johns said agriculture has 
a long, well-established history in Florida.
“A lot of people that grow up in Florida have no idea how large of a presence agriculture has within the state and how much it affects statewide policy and environ-mental issues,” he said.
Publicity chairman Sean Bedford said he’s expecting 
about 200 people to attend the event.
“We do really think that this is something that will 
interest a lot of different people from a lot of different backgrounds,” Bedford said.
Nalowa Malafa, a 28-year-old UF third-year law stu-
dent, wrote in an email she will be attending the confer-ence for the third time.
“Studying the environment can be a daunting and 
depressing task,” Malafa wrote, “but coming together with individuals in different fields who are working to-wards solutions provides hope and encouragement.”Law event to focus on agriculture issues Free food alert: Firehouse subs today

Two fiddlers played music to 
the crowd of local artists and art 
enthusiasts Sunday evening dur-ing the unveiling of an art sculp-
ture downtown.
Artist Ted Crom gave his 
mother the honor of cutting the yellow ribbon on “Luna,” a 
13-foot-tall steel crescent moon with human facial features and beaming red eyes. The ceremony took place at the intersection of 
Southeast Second Avenue and 
Southeast First Street across from Dragonfly Sushi.
Crom said he built the sculp-
ture as something fun to do dur-ing his retirement.
He designed and built “Luna” 
in about five months at his home welding shop in Cross Creek, Fla., with the help of a few oth-ers. 
The sculpture’s eyes light up 
in the evening, and Crom said he plans to install a motion sensor to allow the solar-powered eyes to follow passersby.
“We wanted his eyes to fol-
low you as you walk by, which would be an eerie thing if you weren’t expecting it,” he said.
Scarlett Richmond, a 21-year-
old UF journalism senior, attend-ed the ribbon-cutting ceremony because she said she wanted to see if the sculpture was as creepy 
as her friends had told her it 
was.
“I really love the idea, per-
sonally, of all the drunk people 
that are going to get freaked out 
for the first few weeks that don’t know it’s here,” she said.UF environmental engineer-
ing first-year graduate student Jordan Capeloto said he pre-
ferred this sculpture to the pre-
vious art pieces on campus, such as the “Whispering Close” sculp-ture on Plaza of the Americas.
“It definitely catches your 
eye because it’s got the big red lights,” the 24-year-old said. “I enjoy the concept of it.”
Nava Ottenberg, the initia-tor of the public art installation and owner of Persona Vintage Clothing & Costumes, first saw 
Crom’s “Luna” sculpture in No-
vember during the Downtown Festival and Art Show and felt that it belonged permanently 
downtown.
“Art is essential to our being. 
It’s essential in our culture,” she 
said. “The more public art, the bigger it is, the better.”

A group of UF students has 
teamed up with Operation PetSnip 
of Gainesville to raise about $5,000 for homeless pets as a campaign for their sales management class.
Running Buddies for Kittens 
and Puppies offers students the chance to donate a minimum of $5 to be partnered with a motiva-tional running buddy.
Justin Kelsey, a 21-year-old UF 
finance junior, said his sales man-agement class group chose this particular campaign idea because 
of how popular running is among 
UF students.
The group chose to fundraise 
for Operation PetSnip because it supports the organization’s efforts to decrease the amount of pets eu-thanized in Gainesville each year.
“Every dollar donated goes to-
wards helping an animal get this sterilization procedure who nor-mally wouldn’t have anyone to pay for it,” Kelsey said.
Kelsey is even offering his own 
dog, Bella Rose, to join some of the campaign’s 20 runners.
Chelsea Verhoeven, a 20-year-
old UF biology sophomore, said she loves to run and she thinks the project is a great way to get people excited about running.
“Running with people can mo-
tivate you and push you to keep 
going when you normally would 
just give up,” Verhoeven said. “It makes running a bit more enjoy-able with a partner than getting tired by yourself.”
The campaign is planned to 
continue until Spring Break, but Kelsey said he also hopes to turn it into something more long term. Students rent out   
furry running buddies

Florida was the world leader in un-
provoked shark attacks last year with 
23, which is easily the most in the U.S. and more than twice the number as any other country, according to a re-
port released Monday.
None of the Florida attacks was 
among the 10 fatal incidents around 
the world, according to the UF’s Inter-national Shark Attack File.
Worldwide there were 72 unpro-
voked shark attacks in 2013, down from 81 the year before and the lowest recorded since 67 attacks in 2009. The 
U.S. had 47 attacks with 13 in Hawaii, 
six in South Carolina and one each in Alabama, California, North Carolina, Oregon and Texas.
“Sharks have a lot more to fear from 
us than we do from them,” said George Burgess, who maintains the shark file. “Statistically, shark attacks are ex-tremely rare, especially considering the number of humans that enter the water each year.”
The International Shark Attack File 
investigated 125 shark incidents but determined many of them were pro-voked attacks. It defines unprovoked attacks as incidents involving live humans who encounter a shark in its natural habitat and do nothing to pro-voke it. It doesn’t include attacks in aquariums, sharks feeding on people who were already dead or incidents in 
which a person initiates contact with a 
shark.
A shark attack in Hawaii was the 
nation’s only fatality. Australia and Réunion each had two shark attack deaths while Brazil, Diego Garcia, Ja-maica, New Zealand and South Africa had one each.
Florida has averaged 21 unpro-
voked shark attacks during the past 10 years.Florida led world with 23 
shark attacks last year“We wanted his eyes

LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
During the past two weeks, Scottie Wilbekin 
has been everything the No. 2 Gators have need-
ed him to be — and then some.
For his performances in wins last week against 
Tennessee and Kentucky, during which he totaled 
44 points, Wilbekin was named the Southeastern 
Conference Player of the Week on Monday.
“Yeah, they (individual honors) don’t really 
mean anything,” the senior point guard said. “It’s nice to be acknowledged, but I’ve still got to put in work and we’ve still got practice today, so it’s not really going to affect anything.”
Wilbekin’s focus on constantly trying to im-
prove has been apparent in his recent play. 
In UF’s past four games, the senior point guard 
has been on a tear, averaging 19.8 points per con-test on 43.6 percent shooting and a 42.1 percent clip from three-point range. 
During the stretch, he also notched a combined 
15 assists and seven steals.
His most notable performance during the 
stretch came in the Gators’ 69-59 victory against 
the Wildcats in Rupp Arena on Saturday. 
Logging a team-high 36 minutes, Wilbekin 
scored a career-high 23 points on 5-of-10 shooting 
and sunk 2 of 3 attempts from behind the arc.Wilbekin wins league honor after stellar road outings

Florida’s last four victories have come 
by way of the same starting five.
The Gators are a perfect 4-0 when se-
nior Jaterra Bonds, redshirt junior Kayla 
Lewis, redshirt sophomores Carlie Nee-dles and Cassie Peoples and freshman Ronni Williams are on the floor for the 
opening tip. 
Their last two losses, however, have 
featured two different lineups. 
In the loss at Arkansas, Florida insert-
ed redshirt senior Lily Svete in place of Williams. Svete had been thriving when 
coming off the bench up to that point, averaging 12.7 points per contest during Florida’s three-game winning streak that 
made its way into early February. 
But against the Razorbacks on Feb. 
6, Svete scored six points and racked up 
four fouls. Williams was coming off an injury, 
though, and Svete returned to the bench 
for Florida’s next game — an 86-80 vic-
tory against then-No. 15 Kentucky where Svete scored a career-high 17 points. 
Sophomore January Miller had a 
whale of a game against the Wildcats, 
too, scoring a team-high 20 points. 
Her performance was good enough 
to earn her a starting spot against Geor-
gia on Sunday in place of Needles, who 
failed to score a point and tallied one as-
sist against Kentucky. 
“January had a great game against 
Kentucky,” coach Amanda Butler. “Car-lie had struggled a little bit. It’s not some-
thing that we place a whole lot of empha-
sis on in terms of, ‘We’re going to put our best five out there, who’s playing the best right now?’ January’s been in that starting 
lineup as much as Carlie has. Lily’s been 
in as much as Ronni has. We like to think Consistency works for UFwomen’s bAsketbAll
� UF SCORED 19 RUNS IN THREE 
GAMES.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
Florida struggled to score runs 
throughout the 2013 season, but in its 
opening series against Maryland, the bats showed that 2014 would not be a repeat.
The No. 23 Gators (2-1) scored 19 runs 
in their series win with the Terrapins, scoring seven runs or more in two of the three games.
“We swung the bats pretty well,” 
shortstop Richie Martin said. 
Although UF brought in the top re-
cruiting class in the country, returning faces contributed the most to the offense.
Martin leads the Gators in batting aver-
age through the first three games, notch-ing a .455 mark in his 11 at-bats against the Terrapins.
Martin sparked Florida’s offense in the 
rubber game of the series. 
The sophomore worked a six-pitch walk to lead off the game and scored when catcher Taylor Gushue lifted a sac-
rifice fly to right field.
“From the first inning, we saw [Mary-
land pitcher Jared Price] really strug-
gling,” Gushue said. “We knew that he had a good arm. We knew that he had a changeup. We knew what he was trying to do. 
“But he just 
didn’t have his com-
mand [Sunday], so 
we just were patient 
up there, and it paid off for us.”
Martin drove in a run of his own on a 
flyout in the Gators’ four-run second in-ning, but his most powerful contribution came later in the game.
After freshman A.J. Puk notched an 
RBI double, Martin drove him in with a 
double of his own, setting the stage for 
him to work his magic on the basepaths. 
On the first pitch of the following at-
bat, Martin took off for third base, sliding in safely as the ball glanced off third base-man Krysthian Leal’s glove. Martin raced Gators bats off to hot start 
during opening weekend

Florida has been traveling through some uncharted 
territory lately, and it is not somewhere it wants to be.
“This is like beyond my wildest dreams,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said after Florida’s 11th-place finish 
at the SunTrust Gator Invitational over the weekend. “I 
mean, we’ve never had a season even close to this.”
To show how dire this situation is for the Gators, 
their finish at the SunTrust Gator Invitational this past 
weekend was the worst performance ever at the tour-nament.
Alexander wasn’t even the coach at Florida for UF’s 
now-second-worst performance — an eighth-place 
finish in 1981. He was between jobs at his alma mater, 
Georgia Southern, and LSU and competing on the pro-fessional tour.
“I’ve never had any experience like this, even at 
Georgia Southern or LSU, if you want to know the ab-solute truth,” Alexander said. 
The second-worst finish at the tournament un-
der Alexander’s tutelage was last spring. The Gators placed fourth, led by then-sophomore Eric Banks, who 
tied for 10th place with a score of 211 (+1). Seniors Ty-
ler McCumber, Tommy Mou and T.J. Vogel were also part of the squad but have since graduated and moved on to play professionally.
Despite the loss of those three, the 2012-2013 and 
2013-2014 rosters look similar. The program has re-tained standouts such as juniors J.D. Tomlinson and Banks and added freshmen and transfers who have had success in their careers.
So why has Florida struggled so much?Alexander thinks it all may be in the players’ 
heads. 
“It starts in your mind,” he said. “Golf is a mind game in itself.
“I know where I am (mentally), and I’m ready to 
go to war and make some changes and keep battling like heck,” Alexander said. “But I don’t know exactly where (the players) are.”
The Gators could just be discour-
aged due to their disappointing fin-ishes in this season’s tournaments. Their highest placement so far was a tie for third at the Shoal Creek 
Intercollegiate at the beginning of 
October. UF shot a collective 857 (-7) on one of the toughest courses it has played this season.
To Alexander, “the positives outweighed the nega-
tives” during that tournament, but he still wasn’t par-ticularly satisfied with UF’s finish.
The problem is not because of an absence of team 
chemistry. Tomlinson is sure of it.
“We’ve bonded really well, so we do everything to-
gether,” he said. “I think by having that team unity, it kind of makes everybody better, and kind of inspires each other. We have friendly rivalries, so you want to 
keep on doing better than each other.”
Whatever the problem is, Florida needs to find 
the solution soon. The Gators have only four regular-
season tournaments remaining and are running out of time.
“Whatever upside they have, they need to come 
up with pretty quickly,” Alexander said. “There’s just some little aspect of a guy’s game that, whether it’s his wedge play or his putting or his confidence or an in-
tangible of some sort, why some of these guys haven’t 
really performed.
“But it needs to start happening pretty quickly for 
us to realistically be able to go in the postseason and feel confident about doing some good things.”14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2014

for home, scoring Florida’s eighth 
and final run.
Martin knocked another dou-
ble later in the game — a depar-ture from his style of hitting in 
his first season. As a freshman in 
2013, he racked up 51 hits in only 44 games. But of those 51, only six were extra-base hits — five dou-bles and one triple.
Although Martin will likely 
not match the pace he is on, which would put him at 37 doubles for the season, the uptick in power 
production may make him a bet-
ter leadoff hitter. Florida’s leadoff hitter in 2012, shortstop Nolan Fontana, had 20 extra-base hits in his final season at UF before the 
Houston Astros selected him in 
the second round of the 2012 MLB Draft.
The Gators also got production 
out of their third-year backstop.
Gushue hit the ball hard 
throughout the weekend, follow-ing Martin with four hits in his 11 at-bats and leading the team with 
five RBIs in its opening series.
But even when Gushue made 
outs, he put a charge into the ball. 
His sacrifice fly would have gone for extra bases had right fielder Anthony Papio not made a leap-ing catch.
The junior catcher made the 
most noise for an offense that did 
not launch a home run in its open-
ing series, knocking a double off of the right-field wall in the sec-ond game of the series.
The Gators look to continue 
their success in their first mid-week games of the season. Florida plays Central Florida on Tuesday and North Florida on Wednesday 
— both at McKethan Stadium at 
7 p.m.
“We play a good schedule,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Our midweek games are hard … We don’t play any cupcakes.”
But the bulk of Wilbekin’s 
scoring throughout the past 
two weeks has come at the charity stripe late in games. 
The dependable senior 
has earned the reputation of a closer, making 80.4 percent of his free throws during the span. 
He went 9 of 10 from the 
foul line in the final 8:14 of action against Kentucky. 
In the previous game in 
Knoxville, Tenn., the 6-foot-
2 Gainesville native knocked 
down 5 of his 6 free-throw at-tempts in the last 52 seconds of regulation to seal a 67-58 Florida win on Feb. 11.
The senior said taking 
“way more” shots at the foul line during recent practices compared to the beginning 
of the 2013-14 campaign has 
helped his accuracy. 
In his first five games back 
after serving a five-game suspension at the start of the year for violating team rules, Wilbekin shot just 46.7 per-cent from the charity stripe.
“(I am) just getting up a 
bunch of free throws outside of practice,” Wilbekin said. “I was shooting really bad in the beginning of the year, so I put some work into it.”
But the Gators have seen 
Wilbekin develop as a floor general. 
Heading into last week 
averaging almost two turn-overs per game, Wilbekin went without a turnover against Tennessee and Ken-tucky and notched a com-bined eight assists.“(I am) just trying to be 
smart with passes, trying not to do too much,” Wilbekin said. “Not trying to make the hero play.”
With the Gators owning 
a 12-0 SEC record and the 
No. 2 spot in this week’s AP 
poll, coach Billy Donovan is happy his senior point guard stayed the course and did not transfer after his offsea-son issues. 
“We probably would not 
be in first place and unde-feated in the SEC if he didn’t 
change,” Donovan said. 
“If he left, we probably 
wouldn’t be undefeated in 
the SEC. So, it was really a two-fold for me. For our team to be better and for him to be better, he needed to change.”
Hill doubtful: After ex-
iting in the second half of Florida’s win at Kentucky with a groin injury, Kasey Hill is doubtful for Wednes-day’s home contest against Auburn. 
The freshman point guard 
missed Monday’s practice and will be re-evaluated to-
day, Donovan said.
“My guess right now, and 
I’ll probably have a better 
idea  [today], but I would say 
he is probably doubtful, not going to play on Wednes-
day,” Donovan said Mon-day. 
Without Hill, Florida will 
have three players — for-ward Dorian Finney-Smith, shooting guard Michael Fra-zier II and guard/forward DeVon Walker alternate at the backup point guard when Wilbekin rests.
of ourselves as pretty interchangeable.”
However, Miller’s recent good fortune 
didn’t follow her to Athens, Ga. 
In the Gators’ 67-58 loss to the Bulldogs, 
Miller only scored five points and subse-
quently fouled out. 
“It was a tough day for January,” Butler 
said. “She had a fantastic outing against Ken-
tucky (and) was really picking her spots well and making her type of plays. (Against Geor-
gia) she just didn’t seem to have that same 
sort of flow, and I think that’s ultimately why she ended up picking up a couple of those fouls. No question that when she’s not on the 
floor, we’re a little bit slower. She makes us 
a lot faster, a lot more dynamic as an attack-ing unit.”
Ironically, Needles outscored Miller com-
ing off the bench, scoring six points. 
To be fair, one can’t logically pin the change in the lineup to Sunday’s loss. Cor-relation does not equal causation, not to mention Georgia had a strong showing on its 
home floor, winning the rebounding battle 
and draining seven threes. 
“They shoot the ball really well against 
us,” Butler said. “Not that they don’t shoot the ball well in general — they’ve got really 
dynamic players in a lot of different spots. 
Our challenge that is there every game is to be able to adjust to game trends. That’s something we talk about all the time and we 
didn’t do a very good job of that [Sunday}.”
Recent history was also not in Florida’s 
favor heading into Georgia. The Gators 
haven’t won a game in Stegeman Coliseum in a decade. 
“They’re very good,” Butler said. “They’re 
good every year. Coach Landers does a great job. There’s not anywhere in our league that I would say is easy to play or easy to win. 
“It’s a spot that’s especially difficult for 
us.”TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

(5-3, 3-2 SEC) will each take on ﬁ  ve of the top-25 teams in the 
country in Athens, Ga.
  On the men’s side, No. 1 Florida headlines the bunch, but 
No. 4 Missouri, No. 6 Georgia and No. 13 Auburn — winner of 
the conference crown in 16 of the last 17 years — could make a 
play for the title during this week’s competition. 
  Florida is the heavy favorite after thrashing its competition 
this season.  UF’s women will have to stare down the country’s best in 
No. 1 Georgia and No. 8 Tennessee. Both got the better of the Gators in the regular season.
  “This is an exciting time for us,” coach Gregg Troy said. 
“Championship season is always big in swimming. Every-thing counts the rest of the way. You’ve got to take your en-thusiasm and maintain it over ﬁ  ve days if you want to win in probably the best conference in the country.”
Eight    SEC champions from a year ago return for the Gators: 
redshirt senior Sebastien Rousseau, seniors Brad deBorde and Marcin Cieslak, juniors Eduardo Solaeche-Gomez and Matt Elliott and sophomore Pawel Werner for the men, and senior Elizabeth Beisel and sophomore Natalie Hinds for the wom-
en.  Cieslak and Beisel will be ﬂ  irting with greatness this week.
  Due to restrictions put in place in 1990, athletes can only 
compete in three events at SECs, but the two will still have a shot at making school history.
  Cieslak’s six SEC individual titles are just two fewer than 
Gator great Ryan Lochte, who shares the all-time record at Florida with two others. 
  The 2012 Polish Olympian will be competing for three con-
ference championships, two of which he won at last year’s SEC meet.
  The face of the women’s team in her time at Florida, Beisel 
has earned seven SEC individual titles and, regardless of how this year pans out, will go down as ﬁ  fth all-time in conference championships at UF. 
  But she has a shot at something more.  If she pulls off the hat trick like she did in 2012, Beisel will 
become the second Gator to win 10 SEC titles since the three-event limit was imposed 24 years ago. She trails only Nicole Haislett, who went a perfect 12 for 12 from 1990-94.
  Beisel has been an iconic swimmer for Florida in her four 
years, earning conference and national individual titles, but she has watched as SEC rival Georgia has gotten the better of her team four years running. 
  She is hoping this year will be different.  “We look really good. I think we do have a chance to beat 
Georgia,” Beisel said. “That’s obviously the goal ... Just try to win.
“It’ll deﬁ  nitely be a tight meet, so we’ll see how it goes.”  Beisel is looking to the rest of her team to step up in what 
she called a grudge match after UF fell to UGA in November 2013.
  Senior Hilda Luthersdottir was a swimmer Beisel men-
tioned. Her performances in the 100- and 200-yard breast-stroke claimed both of Florida’s school records this year. 
  She brings them along with her, taking that energy and ig-
niting her fellow Gators to swim fast through the joy it brings her. It’s something she doesn’t try to hide.
  “It’s inspiring for all of us because seeing her as happy as 
she is after her race, swimming fast,” Beisel said. “It makes us all want to feel the same thing.” 
  And ending a collegiate career with something Florida 
hasn’t been able to accomplish since 2009 — the SEC crown — is something that she knows is within reach. 
  “I think this is the best team that I’ve ever been a part of in 
my four years here,” Beisel said. 
“So for it to be my senior year, I really want to do really 
well.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2014
